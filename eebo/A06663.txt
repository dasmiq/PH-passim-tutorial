To the moste
honorable and verteous Lady
Marie, duchesse of Rychemo~de
her grace, Thomas Beco~ wis|sheth
from God the father
thorow our Lord Iesu
Christ, a faythfull
perseueraunce
in gods most
holy worde
vnto the
ende.
_IT is not without a
greate cause (moste
godly Lady) that y^
holy Apostle sainct
Paule desired the
Thessalonians to holde faste y^
doctrine,ii. Thes. ii. that he had taught the~
afore, and not sodenli to be mo|ued
from their knowlege  vn|derstanding,
nor to be troubled

neyther by spirite, neyther by
wordes, nor yet by letter. For he
vndoubtedly did afore se by the
reuelacion of Gods spirit,Mat. xxiiii. that
there should aryse false anoyn|ted
and false preachers, whiche
shoulde worke great miracles
and wonders, insomuch that if
it were possible, the very elect 
chosen people of God shoulde
be brought into errour, whiche
also shoulde saye, beholde here
is Christe, or there is Christe,
bringing in damnable sectes, 
vtterly denyenge the Lord that
bought them,i. Pet. ii. as Peter sayeth.
He considered the imbecillitie,
weakenes and chyldishe hertes
of men, whiche, excepte they be
corroborated  fortefied with y^
stre~gth of Gods spirit,Heb. xi. are sone
caried aboute with diuers and
strau~ge learninges, embrasing
no lesse gredely that that is to

them selfs noysome and pestife+rous,
than that whiche is good
and profitable, as we at thys
present time se dayly before our
eyes, both in the Papistes and
Anabaptistes, with suche other
damnable sectaries. Therfore
this moste excellent Apostle de|sired
the Thessalonians, yea, 
so many of vs,Math. x. as professe Christ
vnfaynedly, to perseuer  abide
in the worde of trueth eue~ vnto
the ende, that we may be saued,
 not lightly to be moued with
the subtile and crafty persuasi|ons
of them, that teache weake
and beggarly tradicions with
humayne constitucions,Galat. iiii. which
gyue hede to fables and mens
commaundementes that turne
away the folowers of them fro~Tit. i.
the trueth, whiche professe that
they know God, but with their
dedes they deny him, inasmoch

as they are abhominable  dis|obedient,
yea,. Timo. iii. and vnmete to al
good workes, which loue their
owne pleasurs more than God,
hauinge an vtter apperans of
godly liuing, but denyeng the
power therof, whiche runne fro~
house to house and bringe into
bondage both men and women
lode~ with synne, which are led|de
with diuers lustes, euer lear|nynge,
and neuer able to come
vnto the knowlege of the truth
which are enemies of the crosse
of Christe,Phil. iii. whiche call that is
euill good, and y^ is good,Esa. v. euill
 ce.Act. xx. In fewe, whiche are raue|nynge
wolfes, not sparyng the
flocke. Dothe the world wante
these enemies of Gods glory?
Haue not we also nede to take
hede vnto the aforesayde whol|some
admonicion of the holye
Apostle saincte Paule? Doeth

not the worlde at this daye no|rishe
such vngodly monstures?
What age hath bene withoute
them syns the beginning of the
worlde? What nede I to speke
of that great whore of Babilo~,
the mother of fornicacions and
abhominacions of the earthe,Apoc. xviii.
whiche hath made dronken w^t 
the wyne of the wrathe of her
whoredom all the nacions of y^
earth, yea, the very kinges and
rulers of the earth haue playde
the aduouterers with her. The
fornicacio~ of that most filthy 
stinking strompet is so openly
knowen,  made manifest vnto
vs, both by godly bokes and
learned sermons, that it nedeth
not here to be rehersed. And
woulde God, that as the name
of this Babilonical strompet is
exiled out of mennes mouthes
and rased out of bokes among

vs, so in lyke maner her whore|dome
I meane, the popysh and
deuelish decrees, which fighte
with y^ manifest worde of God,
mighte ones be vtterly exiled,
banyshed, and for euer dryuen
away from the bondes of Chri|stendome,
that all thinges in
the Christen publique weale,
both in this and in other foren
Realmes mighte be instituted,
ordered and appoynted, accor|dinge
to the veritie of Christes
moste blessed Gospell. But be|sides
this monstrous beaste,
are there rysen, not a few, which
are playne Antichristes,  daily
labour to obscure the glory of
God. No maruel, seyng that in
the Apostles time,i. Ioan. ii. iiii. blessed Iohn
co~fesseth that there were many
Antichristes and false Prophe|tes.. Ioan. i
What nede I to speake of
them, which teache that Christ

by his moste precious death de+liuered
vs onely from original
synne? Which teache that man
is iustified by his owne workes
and not by the fayth alone,Roma. iii. viiii. that
he hath in Christes moste bles|sed
death? which teache, that by
obseruinge mens tradicions e|uerlasting
life is gote~?Ephe. ii. Which
teach that external ceremonies
iustifie and put awaye synne?
Whiche teache that ma~ is able
of his owne strengthe to fulfill
the lawe, and to satisfie the iu|stice
of God?i. Timo. ii. which teache that
our prayers can not be hearde
without the intercession of o|ther?i. Ioan. i.
Which teache that all ho|nour
pertayneth not too God
alone? whiche teache that the
bloude of oure sauioure Iesu
Christ is not a sufficient Pur|gatoryei. Ioan. i.
for all oure synnes, ex|cept
we be broyled, boyled and

perboyled in y^ Popes fornace?
Whiche teache that the Lorde
Christe gaue not hym selfe soHeb. vii. ix. x.
plenteously a swete smelling sa+crifice
to God the father for vs,Ephe. v.
that with the one oblacion of
hys moste blessed body,Mah. ix. he hath
made the~ perfect for euermore,Marc. ii.
that are sanctified?Luc. v. Which tea|che
that God alone forgeueth
not synne, but synnefull man
also? Are not these very Anti|christes?
enemies of y^e crosse of
Christ? defacers of Gods glory
fals annoynted? fals preachers
rauening wolfs? cloudes with|out
water?ii. Pet. ii trees without frute?
raging waues of y^ sea, foming
out their owne shame? wa~dring
starres, to whome is reserued y^
myste of darkenes for euer? me~
pleasers, hauing men in greate
reuerence for auauntage sake?
curssed chyldren, whiche haue

forsaken the right waye,  are
gone astray? these are they dou|btles,
of whome bothe Christ 
his apostles bidde vs take hede
in so many places of the holy
scripturs. Agaynst these ought
all men to fighte, that tender y^
glory of God.Luc. xxii. To confounde
these Antichristes, ought we to
sell walet, scrippe, cote, with all
that euer we haue, and to bye
vs a swerde, I meane y^ swerde
of the spirit, which is the worde
of God. And to this ende that
I maye prouoke other vale|auntly,
and boldely to fighte a|gaynste
these aforesayde Anti|christes.
I according to the ta|lent
geuen me, haue taken vpo~
me to wrastle with those wicked
Papistes, which beleue  teach
that God alone doeth not for|geue
synne, but man also with
y^ same power,  like authoritie

Whiche thinge I take in ha~de
the more gladly, because I se y^
thys kynde of doctrine is a
great defacing of Gods glory,
and that it throweth many into
great dau~ger, forasmuche as
they looke for that at the hand
of man, whiche onely is the gift
of God, yea, it encourageth not
a fewe to lyue dissolutely, and
without the feare of God, seyng
they are perswaded, that if the
Prieste layeth his hande ones
vpon their head, and saye Ego
absoluo te, they are quyte dely|uered
of their synneful burden,
and though they returne strey|ght
waies vnto their filthy vo|myte,
what skylleth it? Ego a|soluo
te will dispatche all togy|ther.ii. Ts. ii.
If any man sitteth in the
temple of God, bosting him self
as God, surely they do it, which
take vpon the~ the office of God,

that is to remitte and forgeue
synne.Esa. xi. But they shall be slayne
with the breath of the Lordes
mouth. The order, which I wil
obserue in the treatise folowing
is this. Fyrst I wil proue with
manifest scriptures, that God
alone forgeueth sinne. Seco~dli
that the Priest is but a minister
appoynted of God, to declare
fre remission of synnes to the
truly penitent, to declare, I say
and not to forgeue. Thirdly I
will aunswer to the obiections
of the aduersaries, and vtterly
wype them awaye, restorynge
the scriptures to their natiue
sense. At the laste, leste I should
seme to despyse the true  Chri|sten
absolucion of a faythfull
Minister,  the vse of y^ keyes,
whiche consisteth in preaching,
I will expresse my mynde, con|cerninge
them also, so that to

any indifferent person, I doubt
not, but that my iudgeme~t shal
appeare godly and confirma|be
to the true vayn of the holy
scriptures. Thys littel trea|tyse

The Castel
of comforte.
_THat God a|lone
absol|ueth
y^e truly
penitent, and
onely forge|ueth
the syn|nes
of so ma|ny
as with vnfayned fayth and
harty repentaunce conuerte,
turne and fle vnto his mercy, it
is manifestly proued by diuers
textes of y^ holy scripture. First
let vs heare,Esa. xlii what God him self
sayeth by the Prophet, I am he
yea, I am he in dede, which put+teth
awaye thy synnes, yea, and
that for myne owne sake, and I
will remember thy synnes no|more.
Call to remembraunce, 
let vs be iudged together. Tel,

if thou haste any thinge y^ thou
mayste be iustified. Thy first fa+ther
synned,  thy Prophetes
haue trespassed agaynste me.
Are not these woordes euident
ynough?Math. xxiiii God the father per|ceyuynge
righte wel, that there
shoulde aryse fals annoynted 
fals preachers, whiche without
all shame woulde arrogantlye
arrogate, and proudely chale~ge
to them selfes that power of
forgeuinge synne, whych alone
pertayneth to him, plainly here
affirmeth, that he alone putteth
away oure sinnes. And because
he would haue vs the more se|riously
and earnestly to beleue
it, he repetethe thys worde, I
twyse, sayinge, I am he, yea, I
am he in dede, whiche putteth
awaye thy synnes, yea, and that
for myne awne sake. And leaste
any man shoulde thynke, that

one may more forgeue another
hys synnes (I speake of those
synnes, which are betwene God
and our conscience, and not of
the brotherly reconciliation) he
affirmeth that our firste father
Adam, and all Prophetes and
preachers haue synned, so that
of them no remission of synnes
is to be loked for.Ioan. iii. Can fleshe pu+rifye
the soule?Roma. iii.. that whiche is
borne of fleshe,Roma. xi is fleshe sayeth
Christ. All haue synned, sayeth
saint Paule, and wante y^ glory
of God. Again, God hath wrap+ped
all nacions, sayth he in vn|belefe,
that he might haue mer|cy
on all.Ephe. ii. If al be sinners, flesh,
and the chyldren of wrath,Luce. xvii. if al
be hipocrites, vnprofitable ser|uauntes,
earth, dust and ashes,
if all be the enemies of God 
vnfaythfull, howe dare we be
so bolde, as to take vpo~ vs one

to forgeue another their syn|nes?
Is a traytoure a mete ma~
to purchase a pardon of a Price
for another traytoure? Can one
traytoure forgeue another hys
treason? Ca~ one sinner forgeue
another his sinne?Iob xiiii Of the vn|clene
what ca~ be made clene? as
Iob saith: Who can make him
clene, that is conceyued of vn|clene
sede? Is it not thou alone
o Lorde? It is the Lorde alone
in dede,Psal. x. ii. as Dauid sayeth, thou
o Lord, shalte sprinkle me with
Hysop,  I shall be made clene,
yea, I shall be made whyther
than snowe. And as our sauior
Christe sayde vnto Peter,Ioan. xiii. If I
washe the not, thou haste no
parte with me. If God washeth
vs not from oure filthines, we
haue no parte in the heritage of
Christ. Agayn the aforesayde
Prophet sayth,Ese. xxxiii the Lord is our

iudge, the Lorde is our Lawe|geuer,
the Lorde is our Kynge,
and he it is that shall saue vs.
Howe ofte is the Lorde here re|peted,
to shewe y^ it is he alone,
whiche worketh all good thin|ges
in vs, which forgeueth our
synnes, and saueth vs, yea, and
none but he alone. Agayne the
Lorde hym selfe sayeth by the
same Prophet,. I am the Lorde
 there is no Sauiour besides
me. Here God hym selfe co~fes|seth,
that he alone is the Lorde,
and that there is none other sa|uiour
besydes hym, that is too
saye, none that forgeueth synne
and geueth eternall lyfe, but he
alone.. xii. By another Prophet he
also saieth, thy destruccio~, o Is|rael,
cometh of thy self, onely of
me cometh thy healpe and sal|uacion.
Dauid that holy kyng
and godly Prophet, knowyng

hys deliueraunce from sinne to
be of God alone, stireth vp his
inwarde man to magnifie the
Lorde, sayinge: magnifye the
Lorde, o my soule, and all that
are within me, prayse his holy
name. O my soule blesse y^ Lord
and forget nor al his benefites..
For he it is that pardonneth al
thyne iniquities,  that healeth
all thy diseases, yea, he it is, y^
deliuereth thy lyfe from destruc+cion,
and crouneth the in mercy
and louing kyndnesse. Agayne
let Israel trust in the Lord,Psal. . for
with the Lord there is infinite
mercy, and plenteous rede~ptio~.
And he it is that redemeth Is|rael
fro~ all their sinnes. Who|soeuer
therfore taketh on hym
to forgeue synne, maketh hym
selfe a sauiour, and sayeth with
the Aungell Apostata,Es. xiiii. I will
clyme vp aboue the hygh clou|des

and I will be lyke vnto y^
mooste hyghest. But let hym
knowe, that pryde will haue a
faule, and that the Lorde is a
ielous God, and will geue hys
glorie to none other.Esa. xii Who deli|uered
Adam from euerlastinge
damnacion,Gene. iii. whan he with hys
wyfe had transgressed the com|maundeme~t
of the hygh Lord?
Who absolued Nohe from his
dronkennes? Who deliuered
Loth fro~ the vnclennes, which
he committed with hys dough+ters?Gene. xix.
Who saued Moyses, and
forgaue hym hys manslaugh|ter?Exod. ii.
Who absolued Dauid fro~
hys adultry?iii. Reg. xi. Who had co~pas|sion
on the Niniuites wha~ they
repe~ted,Ionus. iiii. beleued and co~uerted?
To be shorte, who forgaue and
absolued all the Patriarckes,
Kynges, Prophetes, prestes, c
with all other of the olde testa|ment,

whan they knowledged
their sinnes, and returned vnto
the Lord their God, with faith|full
repentau~ce, but onely God
alone? to whome did theife for
remission of sinnes, but to God
alone? In whome did they put
their afflaunce and trust, but in
God alone? as the Psalmogra|phe
testifieth,Psal. xx. sayinge: Our fa|thers
trusted in the, o Lord, yea
they trusted in the, and thou de+liuerest
them. They cryed vnto
the, and they were made safe, in
the o Lord, they trusted,  were
not confounded. Are not these
the woordes of blessed Dauid?
I sayde,Psa. xxxii. I wil confesse my sin|nes
vnto the Lorde, and thou
forgauest the wickednes of my
sinne. Here is no mencio~ made
of Aaro~ or of any of that priest|hode,
nor yet of Pope, Patri|arcke,
Cardinall, Archebishop

Bishop, Prieste, or of any other
man to forgeue vs our synnes,
but of God alone. So foloweth
it, that the Lorde alone remit|teth
the vngodlynes of oure
synne, and that he alone absol|ueth
a pena et culpa. This was
godly doctrine in the olde testa+ment,
neyther was he counted
of godly me~ any Heretyke that
taught this kynde of learning
at that tyme. God was tha~ the
Lorde alone omnisufficient for
all hys people that truly repen|ted
and conuerted to his vnme+surable
mercye, neyther had he
nede at that tyme of any other
to be conioyned with hym, as
he hym selfe sayde vnto Abra|ham,Gene. xv.
feare not Abraham, I am
thy defender and thyne altoge|ther
sufficient rewarder, and is
the Lordes hande nowe so ab|breuiated
and shortened,Esa. lix. that

he can saue nomore? or is hys
eare so stopped that he can not
heare? Lorde God, what a soe~
chaunge is this? But I sted|fastly
beleue, that he is thesame
Lorde now, that he was in the
olde tyme, and of no lesse po|wer
to remit sinne at thys pre|sent,
than he was many thou|sande
yeres before these oure
dayes, in asmuche as he aby|deth
euer one, and is not chau~|geable,
as he sayeth by the Pro+phet
Malachie,Malac. iii. I am the Lord
and am not chaunged.
Hytherto haue I bene holde
in few wordes to proue, y^ in the
time of the olde law, God alone
forgaue the synnes of his peo|ple
without the helpe, eyther of
Bishop, Prophet, prieste, leuite
or any other, y^t the whole glory
of their saluacion might be as|cribed
to hym alone. Nowe let

vs also labour to declare, that
God alone doth the very same
thynge in the new testament, y^
he alone maye stil remayne the
God of health agaynst the pe|stilent
doctrine of the wicked
Papistes, whiche so borishelye
sweate to maintaine their vsur+ped
power, and fayned authori+tie
to the greate obscuringe of
Gods glorie, and that to hym
alone all honour and prayse
maye be geuen.i. Timo. i
We reade in the holy gospel
that when a certen man beyng
diseased of the palsey, was bro|ught
vnto Christe to be made
whole, Christ sayde vnto hym:
Sonne be on a good conforte,Math. ix
thy sinnes are forgeue~ the. The
Scribes hearing these wordes
of forgeuing sinne, thinking w^t
the~ selfs y^ Christ was not God,
but ma~ onely,  that it was the

office of God alone too remit 
forgeue synne, spake on thys
manner within them selfs. Hic
blasphemat, this felow blasphe|meth,Marc. ii.
or as Marke  Luke wri+teth,Luce. v
Who is he y^ speaketh blas+phemies?
Who is able to for|geue
sinne but God alone? here
the Scribes te~dering more the
glory of God then our papistes
 pharises do at this time, could
not abyde y^ Christ, whome they
iudged only ma~, should chale~ge
to him power to forgeue sinne,
seing y^ alone pertained to God.
And vpo~ this place of y^e scriptu+re
many write y^t y^ Scribes er|red
not in this co~fession y^ God
alone forgeueth synne, but in
this thei sai, thei were deceyued
because thei beleued not, y^ christ
was bothe God and man. If
Christe had bene nothinge but
ma~, he had blasphemed in dede,

that is to say, taken that thing
vpon hym, whiche is the office
of God alone, but forasmuche
as he was not onely man, but
also God, he blasphemeth not,
he chalenged nothing but that
was hys righte. So did the
Scribes and not Christe blas|pheme.
Let all men therefore
learne of this historie, that God
alone forgeueth synne. Doeth
not Christe also in the aforesaid
chapter of Matthew,Math. ix call hym
selfe a Phisicion, and shew that
he came to call synners vnto re+pentaunce,
and to make them
whole? Why calleth he him self
a phisicion, but because it is his
office to cure and heale?Iere. xvii. Iere|my
prayed vnto this phisicion,
sayeng: heale me o Lorde,  I
shall be healed, saue thou me, 
I shall be safe, for thou arte he
whome I will magnifye. For

he did knowe full well, that all
other phisicions were vnprofi|table
without his helpe, and no
more mete to cure sicke consci~|ces
of them selfes, then the olde
Lyon was to heale the horse, of
whome Esope writeth in his fa+bles,
whiche notwithstandyng
take on him to practise phisicke
wha~ of that same scie~ce he was
altogether ignorante.Math. xi. More|ouer
Christe calleth all them y^
labour and are laden to hym, 
promiseth that he will refreshe,
ease and conforte them. He sen|deth
them not awaye to other,
but calleth them all withoute
excepcion to hym, whereby he
sheweth that no creature, ney|ther
in heauen nor in earth can
truly and sufficiently heale our
infirme and sicke consciences,
but he alone,Ioan. x. whiche sayeth, I
am the resurrectio~ and lyfe. He

that beleueth in me, althoughe
he be dead, shal lyue, and euery
one that liueth and beleueth in
me, shal neuer dye. For who can
forgeue me my synne, but he a|lone,
which is without al sinne?
Who can deliuer me fro~ death
 hel,i. Pe. ii but he alone, which hath
ouercome them both?Ose. xiii. Who ca~
make me good, but he alone,
whiche onely is good?Math. xix. Who ca~
make me wyse, righteous and
holy, but he alone, which is ap|poynted
of God the father to be
our wysdome, righteousnes, 
sanctification?i. Cor. . Finally, who ca~
engraffe in me life  vertu, but
he alone, in whome is all hope
of life and vertue?Eccle. xxiiii Therfore ful
well doth Christ cal so many as
labour and are loden with the
burde~ of synne to him,Mat. xi. and pro|miseth
that he wil refresh them,
that is to saye, absolue and de|liuer

them frome their synnes.
Hereto belongeth the sayinge
of blessed Iohan Baptiste,Ioan. i. Be|holde
that la~be of God, whiche
taketh awaye the sinne of the
worlde. Here blessed Baptiste
confesseth, that it is Christe a|lone,
whiche absolueth and ta|keth
awaye the synne of the
worlde. Doeth not also the
holy Euangelist sainct Iohan
in the aforesayde Chapter call
Christe that true lighte, which
lighteneth euery man that co|meth
into this worlde: what o|ther
thinge is it to lighten, tha~
too put awaye the cloudes of
synnes, and to sende into oure
hertes the radiante and gliste|ringe
beames of the eternall
sonne, whiche is the knowlege
of Gods mooste holy will. And
this, sayeth saincte Iohan, is
the office of Christe alone.
Why doth Christe cal so many
as thyrste vnto hym,Esa. iv.  promy|seth
that floudes of lyuysh wa|ter
shall flowe out of their bel|lies:Ioan. vii.
yea,poc. xxii. and that he will geue
them the water of life frely but
onely to shewe, that whosoeuer
is thyrsty, and hartely desireth
remission of synnes, muste with
all haste come to hym,Psal . and saye
with the Psalmographe, Lyke
as the harte desireth the water
brokes, so longeth my soule af|ter
the, o God. My soule is a
thyrste for God, yea, euen for y^e
liuinge God. c. Furthermore
Christe commaundeth y^t repen|taunce
and remission of sinnes
shoulde be preached in his na|me.. i iii.
Where we may learne, that
forgeuenes of synne cometh
onely by the name of Christe.
And in the Actes of y^ Apostles
we fynde, y^ when any famous

 notable acte or miracle was
done the people, as manye at
this daye, did ascribe it to the
vertue and power of the Apo|stles,
willynge to do sacrifice
vnto them for it, but the Apo|stles
did reiecte and cast awaye
all suche immerited honor and
vndeserued prayse, contendyng
and maynly laborynge to per|swade
the people,Act. iii. . xiii that whatso|euer
was don, came not to passe
by their power, but by the ver|tue
of Iesu Christe, whom God
raysed vp from death. And whe~
they made mencion of remissio~
of synnes, they did neuer reme~|ber
and reherse their owne po|wer
to forgeue synne, but onely
preached, that so many as bele|ued
and were baptised into the
remission of synnes, shoulde be
absolued and frely forgeuen by
the name of Iesu Christe. And

in the actes of the apostles bles|sed
Peter playnly confesseth,Act. x. y^
there is no health, no lyfe, no re+mission
of synnes, but in Christ
alone, and that there is none o|ther
name geuen vnto me~ vn|der
heauen, wherein they muste
be saued,Act. iiii. but the name of Iesu
Christe alone. Neyther did the
Apostles absolue any otherwise
than by the preachyng of gods
worde, which whe~ it was heard
 beleued, than were y^ diligent
hearers, and faythful beleuers
of the same truly absolued, as
Christ sayeth. Now are ye clene
for the wordes sake that I haue
spoken vnto you, that is. Now
are ye deliuered fro~ your sinnes
because ye haue beleued my
preaching.an. xv. The fayth of y^ herte
iustifieth, sayeth sainct Paule.
Where it maye be learned,Roma x. y^ if
fayth be not geuen to the worde

there is no absolucion or deliue+rau~ce
fro~ sinne.Roma. xiii For whatsoeuer
is not of fayth, is sinne,  where
fayth is not, there abydeth the
wrathe of God, as holy Iohan
Baptist sayeth,Ioan. iii he y^ beleueth y^
sonne, hath euerlasting life, but
he that beleueth not the sonne,
shal not se life, but the wrath of
God abydeth vpon him.Math. viii ix. xv. Ther|fore
before Christ absolued any
man of his synnes,Marc. v. ix. he did be|holde
 se,Luc. xvii. xv whether he had faith
or not.Ioan. xi. If Christe founde true
fayth in his hert, tha~ he alwais
sayde, thy fayth hath saued the.
Seyng than y^e none can search
the hert, whyther it be faythfull
or vnfaythful but God alone,
seynge also that the absolution
beareth no strength, but where
faythe is, it foloweth that none
canne absolue me of my syn|nes,Iere. xvii.
but that Lorde alone,

whiche searcheth the raynes 
the herte.Psal. vii. The prieste is onely
Gods minister,Apoc. i. appoynted of
God (if he be truly sent) to prea|che
that absolucion and fre de|liueraunce
from my synne, tho|row
the name of Iesu Christe,
whiche prechinge if I beleue,
I am so sure to be deliuered fro~
all my sinnes, as though Christ
hym self had sayde vnto me,oan. xv. I
frely absolue the, or thy synnes
are forgeue~ the for thy faythes
sake in my name. Are not these
the wordes of Christ,Tit. . whiche is
the self trueth and can not lye,
spoken too all faythfull Mini|sters?Luc. x
He that heareth you, hea|reth
me, and he that depyseth
you, despiseth me, and he that
despyseth me, despiseth hym y^
sent me. But let vs reherse mo
scriptures, althoughe too anye
Christen hert, these, whiche hy|therto

I haue recyted, maye
seme abundantly too suffice.
Blessed Paule in his Epistel to
the Romains proueth mani|festly,Roma. viii.
that God alone iustiieth
vs. If our iustificacion cometh
from God alone, than foloweth
it wel, that the remission of our
sinnes cometh from God alone
also. For remission of synnes
goeth before Iustification.Roma. iiii. By
Christes death are we deliuered
from our synnes but by his re|surreccion
are we instiide and
made righteous. So doeth it
euidently appere, that it is God
alone,i. Cor. i. which both remitteth the
synne, and also iustifieth y^ syn|ner
for Christes sake, which is
our righteousnes.Roma. viii. Agayne the
aforesayde Apostle sayeth, that
God hath not onely geuen vs
his sonne, but also all thinges
with hym. Ergo absolucion of

synnes. So se we y^ God alone
absolueth  forgeueth vs oure
synnes for Christes sake. Sai~t
Paule to the Galathians affir|meth,Galat. i.
that Christ gaue him self
for our sinnes, that he might de+liuer
vs from this present euill
worlde, that is to saye, from all
euil in this present worlde. Er|go
God alone it is,. Cor. vi. which deli|uereth
vs from oure sinnes in
this vale of misery. Ye are was|shed
awaye from your sinnes,
sayeth he, yea, ye are sanctified
 made righteous by y^ name of
the Lord Iesu, and by the spirit
of our God. Ergo our absolu|cion,
oure deliueraunce frome
synne, our sanctification, oure
iustification and all that euer
good is cometh frome God
thorowe Iesu Christ our Lord.
Agayn he sayeth,Ephe. i. God y^ father

hath blessed vs with all spiri|tuall
blessinges, ergo with the
blessinge of absolucion and fre
deliueraunce from all oure sin|nes.Colos. i.
God hathe deliuered vs
from the power of darkenes,
and caryed vs into the kynge|dome
of his welbeloued sonne,
by whome we haue redemptio~,
euen by hys bloude remission
of synnes. Ergo by Christes
bloude are we absolued and de+liuered
frome oure synnes.
Euery good gyfte and euery
perfecte gifte,Iac. . sayeth Iames,
cometh from aboue, and desce~|deth
frome the father of lyght.
Ergo absolucion, whiche is a
good and perfecte gyfte, co|meth
doune frome the father
of lyghte. Blessed Ihon
in his epistle sayeth: If we con|fesse

our synnes, god is fayth|full
 righteous to forgeue vs
oure synnes  to make vs cle~ne
from all iniquite. Here saynct
Ihon affirmeth,i. Ioan. i that God for|eueth
vs our synnes, and ma|h
vs clene from all vnrigh|teousnes.
He sayeth also, that
the blude of Iesu Christ gods
ow onne,i. Ioan. ii. maketh vs cleane
 sinne. And in the chap|
olowyng he sayeth, If any
an synneth, we haue an aduo+cate
with the father Iesu Christ
that righteous one. And he it
is that obtaineth mercy for our
synnes, not for our sinnes only,
but for al the world also. Again
he sayeth, I writte vnto you, o
ye litle chyldren, that your syn|nes
are forgeuen you for Chri|stes
name sake. Here se we agai~
that by Christ remission of syn|nes
cometh to vs from God the

father. Moreouer blssed Ihon
in hys reuelacion writteth on
this manner,Apoc. i. Christ hath loued
vs, and washed vs fro~ our syn|nes
by hys bloude. Here se we y^
all our synnes be washed away
by Christes bloud alone. What
shoulde I write more If I go
forthe to gather together al the
places of holy scripture, y^ proue
the absolucion of our sinnes to
come from God alone, I shuld
not onely trouble the mooste
godly Reader, but also writte a
volume more Prolrior tha~ the
Iliades of the greke poet Ho|mere,
whan to any christen iud|gement
I maye iustly seme all
redy to haue poroued my arti|cle
true  sufficiently christe~ me~
vnto y^ great shame of all these
Papistes, which cease not with
their ste~torous voyces to speke
euill of the true preachers of

Gods worde, and to obscure or
deface the glory of God. Take
away the power of onely remit+tinge
synnes from God,  what
remayneth there, wherfore we
should confesse our selfs bou~de
to hym? I speake of matters
concernynge the saluacion of
our soules. If all that be of the
shauen nacion, haue power to
absolue men of their sinnes at
their pleasure, and to remit or
retayn, whose iniquities it plea+seth
them, than is God wel pro+moted,
eue~ out of y^ Halle into y^
Kytchyn, as they vse to saye.
So shoulde it also folowe, that
so many as pleased the priestes
shoulde haue their synnes for|geuen
them, and so be saued, o|therwyse
not. O intollerable
blasphemy. But as God alone
remitted the synnes of the fa|thers
of the olde Testament, so

in lyke maner doth he nowe in
the new testament.Luc. vii. Who absol+ued
Mary Magdalene fro~ her
sinnes, but Christe? Who for|gaue
the thefe hys robbery and
ma~slaughter,Luc. xxiii. but Christ? Who
had compassion on Peter, wha~
he had denied his master christ,
but Christ?Math. ix Who made of Mat
thew the publicae and tolga|therer,
a faithful apostle  prea+cher,
but Christe?Luc. v. Who is that
good shepeharde,Iohn. x. that fetcheth
home the strayeshepe, louingly
vpon hys shulders vnto the
shepefolde, is it not Christe,
whiche sayeth of him self, I am
that good shepeharde? A good
shepeharde geueth his lyfe for
the shepe. Who receyued home
ioyfully the loste sonne, was it
not Christe?Luc. v. Who healed the
wounded manne? the Prieste
or the Leuite? Or rather

Christe the Samaritane? who
made of Saul the persecutour,
Paule an Apostle, was it not
Christe? Who absolued al these
with many other in y^ scripture
from their synnes, but Christe
alone, the sonne of the liuynge
God?Mat. xxviii Doth not al power belo~g
to Christe, both in heauen and
in earth? to hym therfore alone
doeth the power of remitinge
synne pertayne. Seyng than y^
this is true, and nothyng more
true, why maye we not be bolde
to saye, agre the Papistes, y^
God alone absolueth the truly
penitent, and onely remitteth
the synnes of so many as wyth
an vnfayned fayth conuerte 
fle vnto hys mercy? If this be
heresy, whiche we onely confesse
and teache. I coulde allege di|uers
sentences out of the holy
doctors of Christes churche,

which maintaine this doctrine.
But seyng I fighte not for the
auauncement of man, but for y^
glory of God, I wil not satisfie
this my worke with mans doc|trine,
but with the infallible ve+rite
of Gods word. For I know
that euery man is a lyar,Psal. .  but
God is true,Esa. xl.  hys worde aby|deth
for euermore.
Now will I prepare my self
to the second parte of this trea|tise,
and afterwarde make aun+swer
to the obieccio~s of the ad|uersaries,
that God maye styll
remayne a glorious God in the
presence of al men, and al other
recou~ted duste and ashes in co~|parison
of hym. The seconde
parte of this treatise is this, as
concernyng the priest, he forge|ueth
not the synne, but onely is
a minister of God, appointed to
vtter  declare that fre remissio~

of synnes purchased for vs of
God the father, by the most pre|cious
bloude of Iesu Christe.
This maketh the Papistes to
cry, ad ignem, ad ignem. For this
doctrine plucketh them doune
one staffe lower than they were
before. They may now become
no more Checkemate with God.
For before they were not onely
not contented to be his mini|sters,
but also they woulde be
heylefellow wel mette with hi~.
Now shall they be fayne, eyther
to be y^ messengers and seruau~|tes
of God, or els playne Anti|christes
and papistes. But let
vs se, what the scripture sayeth.
That the priest forgeueth not
synne but God alone, it is suffi+cie~tly
proued before. Now must
we learne of y^ holy scriptures,
whyther y^ priest be but onely a
minister appoynted of God to

vtter  declare y^ absolucio~  fre
deliuerau~ce from synne, or not.
That this is his office, it is ma+nifest
by diuers places of y^ new
testame~t. Wha~ Christ sent forth
his disciples, he sayd vnto them
on this maner: Go into y^ vni|uersal
worlde,  preache y^ Gos|pel
to euery creatur,Max. xvi. who so shal
beleue  be baptised, he shall be
saued, but who so wil not beleue
shalbe conde~ned. Here is it eui|dent
ynough, what authoritie
prestes haue,  what their office
is, verely to preache y^ Gospel 
to baptise. Marke y^ they must
preache y^ Gospell, as s. Paule
sayeth, Christ sent me not onely
to baptise, but to preache y^ Gos+pel.
Again, wo is vnto me,i. Cor. . if I
preache not y^ Gospel.i. Cor. ix. And in y^
discripsio~ of a spiritual minister
he sheweth y^t such one ought to
be chosen, as is not onely lear|ned,
but also apte too teache,

able to exhorte with wholsome
doctrine,  to conuince or ouer|come
them that speake agaynst
the trueth of Christes gospell.
And sainct Peter sayeth, ye el|ders
fede the flocke of Christe,
somuche as in you is. What o|ther
thynge is it to preache the
gospel, than to declare vnto the
people, that their synnes be for|geuen
them frely of God, if they
repent and beleue in Christe, as
it is written. He that beleueth y^
sonne, hath euerlasting lyfe.Ioan. iii. If
synnes be forgeuen of God, 
the ministers commaunded to
declare that same to the people
than doth it folowe, that they
forgeue not the synne, but only
are ministers appointed of god
to publishe that benefite of our
saluacion. If a Prince pardon|neth
his subiect for hys treason
committed against hys person,

and sendeth hys, letters of fa|uoure
to the traytoure, by one
of his faythfull seruauntes, co~|maundynge
him to declare his
pitefull mercy to the gilty, who
forgeueth the fau the messen|ger
or the kynge? I am sure it
wyll be answered the kynge.
And not vniustly. For y^ prince
alone pardoneth, the messen|ger
only declareth hys princes
pleasure to the traytoure. Euen
so all we haue offended,  wor|thely
deserued eternall deathe.
Nowe the good pleasure of our
moste mighty prince is to for|geue
vs euen of his owne fre
mercy, without our desertes or
merites for Christes sake, and
that hys vnspeakable goodnes
towarde mankynde maye be
knowen, he hath appoynted his
ministers to publishe it abrode.
The summe of their commissio~

is this, that whosoeuer will re|pente
hys former lyfe  beleue
to haue remissio~ of their sinnes
thorowe the mercye of God in
Iesu Christ our Lord, they, shal
be forgeuen. The ministers of
God publish these ioiful newes
exhorte vnto repentaunce and
fayth. The people repent  be|leue,
their synnes are forgeuen.
Who forgeueth the synnes of y^
faythful repentau~te? The grau~+ter
of the commission, or the de|clarer
thereof? God or man? I
doubte not, but that ye wil aun+swer,
God. If god alone, whom
we offende, forgeueth the sinne,
and not the declarers of y^ for|geuenes,
I haue gotte~ that I
haue desyred for the probacion
of the second parte of this littel
treatyse. But let vs heare what
Christe sayeth,Ioan. x. as my father
sent me, so sende I you. Nowe

I praye you howe was Christe
sent, and for what purpose?
Let vs heare, what he hym
selfe sayeth, and than shall I
be blamelesse. By the Prophete
Esaye he speaketh on this ma|ner.Esa. lxi.
The spirite of the Lorde is
vpon me,Luc. ii because he hathe a|noynted
me, to preache y^ Gos|pell
too the poore he hath sende
me, to heale the brken hated,
to preache deliueraunce to the
captiue, and sighte to the blind
frely to set at liberte them that
are brosed, and to preache the
acceptable yere of the Lorde.
Agayn he sayth,Luc. iii. I must preach
the glad  ioyful tydinges of y^
kingdom of God to other cities
also, fortherfore am I se~t. Once
again he saith:Mae.  let vs go into y^
next tounes, that I may preach
ther also, for therfor am I come
Al these se~te~ces declare manife|stly,
y^





that Christ was sent to preach
the kyngdome of God, that is
to saye, fre deliueraunce frome
synne to so many as repent and
beleue. If thei wil not be aboue
Christe, they must be contented
to preache the will of the cele|stiall
father, as he was, and not
to take vpon them, that thynge
wherof only they are ministers.
Doth not saint Paule, Iames,
Peter, and Iude, call the~ selfs
the seruauntes of Iesu Christe
in all their Epistles, declaringe
therby, that they are not the self
master, by whome remission 
absolucion of synnes cometh,
but onely the ministers of him,
whiche infundeth and poureth
into all men grace, fauoure, re|mission
of synnes and euerla|styng
lyfe? there is but one ma|ster,
that is to saye,Mat. xxiii. Christe, the
other are seruauntes, as saynct

Paule witnesseth, We preache
not our selfes, but Christe Iesu
the Lorde,ii. Cor. iiii. and we your seruau~|tes
for Iesus sake. Agayn, let a
man this wyse esteme vs, euen
as the ministers of Christ, and
stewardes of y^ secretes of God.i. Cor. iiii.
All these textes declare mani|festlye,
that priestes, if they be
true ministers, and not rather
idolles, are nothinge but mini|sters
and seruau~tes appoynted
of God to declare vnto the chri|sten
congregacion, that fre re|mission
of synnes cometh vnto
vs from God alone, thorow the
glorious name of Iesu christe,
so farre is it of, that the priestes
contrary to their commission ca~
forgeue synnes, whose office co~|sisteth
in declaring, and not in
geuinge remission of sinnes.
Therfore let theim be conte~ted
nomore fro~ hensforth arroga~tly

to arrogate y^t vnto them, which
pertayne to God alone. but hu~|bly
co~fesse, that God onely for|geueth
the synne, and that they
are but commissioners, appoin|ted
of God, to publishe and set|forth
the same, I meane the re|mission
of synnes geuen to the
faythfull penite~t of God alone.
Neyther let theym frowne at
thys doctrine, whiche setteth
them in their righte place, but
rather (as it becometh good 
faythfull seruauntes) let theim
geue the glory of our saluacio~
to God alone, and be glad that
they are called vnto so worthy
 honorable office to declare the
misteries of God to the people,
whose preachinges or sermo~s,
whosoeuer beleueth, may be so
certenly assured of y^ remissio~ of
their sinnes, as though God hi~
self had sayd vnto the~, your sin|nes

are forgeue~ you. For thys
sayng of Christ is an infallible
verite, he y^ heareth you heareth
me.Lu. x. Now let vs beholde y^e obiec+cio~s
of y^ papistes,  briefly con+fute
the~, y^ all y^ glory may be the
Lordes. Fyrst they alledge this
saying of Christe, loosen hym 
let him go away.Ioan. xl. Agayn, loosen
the~ a bring the~ vnto me.Math. xxi. Here is
simple poore shyfte too proue
their absolucion, whan thei are
co~pelled to fle vnto y^ vnteiyng
of a vile shete, and loseninge of
a simple rude Asse. Loke wher|soeuer
the papistes fynde any
worde that cometh of this ver|be
Soluo, that maketh for abso|lucio~
streyght wayes. I maruel
how this escaped theym,Math. xviii. Solue
quod debes. I thinke if Salue re+gina
hadde bene turned into
Solue regina, as some of theim
that be not very fyne mouthed

pronounce it, they wolde not
haue bene ashamed to haue al|ledged
it for absolutio~, euen as
some of the papistes do, which,
where so euer they fynde, Ignis,
take it for Purgatory streyght-wayes.
O noble doctors of
Tyrology, rather than of Theo+logy.
As concerning the first text,
which is that Christ commaun+ded
that Lazarus should be let
loose, and suffered frely to go
hys waye, if they will gather
their absolucion of that, it may
than be proued, y^ all other men
and wome~ haue that same po|wer
so well as they. For there
were at that tyme present, not
onely the disciples of Christe,
but also diuers Iewes with cer+teyn
women, whiche I am sure
were not all priestes. Haue they
not made a good market? they

haue brought a shillinge to .ix.
pens, yea, rather to nothynge.
They haue done fayre by them
selfes by my fay. Whyle thei la+boure
to make them selfs god|des,
 to excell all other in dig|nitie,
they go so wisely to worke
that they haue made them selfs
equal to the mooste inferioure.
O crafty dawbers. Whiche of
them all is able too proue that
Christ spake these wordes, loo|sen
hym and let hym go, rather
to his Disciples than to all the
other indifferently? I thynke
rather that he spake them to y^
women, as mooste comonly oc|cupied
aboute suche thinges.
But to whom he spake, the text
maketh no mencio~, therfore ca~
they proue nothyng.
As touchyng the losoningeMath. xxi.
of y^ Asse, who seeth not their fo|lishnes?
the occasion why christ

sente the disciples for the Asse,
was not to geue theym power
to losen men from their sinnes
at their pleasure, but to fulfil y^e
prophecy of zachary, whiche so
lo~ge before prophecied y^ Christ
shoulde come rydynge mekely
vpon an Asse, contrarye to the
expectacion of the ambicious 
vayne glorious Iewes. What
is this to the purpose? Where
as Christ by this example tea|cheth
humilite, the papistes ga+ther
pryde.ii. Thes. iii Christe submitteth
hym self, euen with the mooste
lowest, and they exalt the~ selfs
with the mooste hyghest, yea, a|boue
all that is called God or
that is worshypped, and syt in
the temple of God, and shewe
them selfes as God. Tell me
good Reader, are not these swe|te
Allegorymakers? I woulde
they woulde ones cease to mo|ralyse,

for they haue lyed too
longe.
Some of them also alledge
this sayinge of Christe, What|soeuer
thou shalt bynde on the
earth, shalbe also bou~de in hea|ue~.
And whatsoeuer thou shalt
loosen on earthe, shall be looso|ned
in heauen. Here they este|me
them selfes more tha~ God|des.
By this texte, they thynke
they maye do, whatsoeuer plea|seth
theym, saue or condemne,
bynde or loose, holde vp or cast
doune, buylde or subuerte, bri~g
to heauen or caste doune to hel,
but if the good men woulde
take the paynes to looke what
goeth before, theyr co~be should
sone be plucked doune, they
wold not make somuch of their
paynted shethe. Christ sayeth a
littel before, I will geue y^, the
keyes of y^ kyngdom of heaue~.

He sayeth not, I geue y^. Christ
in this place onely promised y^
keyes to the congregacion, and
performed his promise after his
resurreccion, as we maye se in y^
Gospel of Ihon. Hereof maye y^
papistes rightwell perceyue, y^
this texte, wherof hytherto they
haue so greatly gloried, and out
of the whiche they haue sucked
so greate aduauntage, maketh
littel vnto the aduaunceme~t of
theyr fayned power.
Their laste and moste stro~g
bulwarke,Ioan. xx. where y^ keyes were
geuen to the true ministers, is
this text, Whosoeuer synnes
ye forgeue, they are forgeuen
vnto them. And whosoeuers
synnes ye retayne, they are re|tayned.
Here they triumphe 
perswade themselfes, that they
haue gotte~ the victory, though
they neuer fight stroke. But if

they will be fauorable to God,
and worke no iniurie to the o|ther
scriptures afore rehersed,
they shall haue no cause to lifte
vp their bristles. Christe spea|keth
here after the manner of
our speache, whiche diligently
must be noted, vnles we wil de|priue
God of his glorie. Whan
we se a man restored to his hea|lthe,
whiche longe before hathe
ben vexed of some greuous dis|ease,
 is made whole thorowe
the diligence of some Phisicion
we vse to saye, Doctor Turner
made this ma~ whole, or doctor
Byll, or some other, whiche is
expert in that kynde of science,
and yet is it not the doctor that
made hym whole, but rather y^e
emplastures and medecines y^
he ministred vnto hym, yea, ra|ther
god, if we wil speake truly
which gaue such vertue to hys

creatures to worke health vnto
the sicke. So doeth the scrip|ture
speake. Somtyme it attri|buteth
our health to the mini|sters
of the worde, as in thys a|foresayde
place, somtyme and
moste como~ly to God hym self,
as we tofore haue abundantly
hearde,  somtyme to the worde
of God,Ioan. xv as it is written. Nowe
are ye clene for the wordes sake
which I haue spoke~ vnto you,
Ite~,Sapi. xvi. Neyther herbe nor empla|sture
hathe healed the~, but thy
worde, o Lord, y^ healeth al thin+ges.
Hereto pertaineth y^e saying
of y^e Psalmographe,Psal. e. vii he sent his
worde,  healed the~,  deliuered
the~ fro~ their destruccions, and
yet doeth God onely make vs
whole,  forgeue vs our sinnes
as he himself witnesseth by the
Prophet,Ose. xiii. saying, thy destruccio~
o Israel cometh of thy self, only

of me cometh thy helpe  salua|cion.
What ca~ be more plainly
spoke? Who is able once to his|ke
against these thinges? Who
wil once ope~ his mouth to barc+ke
agaist this doctrine? Noma~
I suppose, except he be altoge|ther
drouned in papisme. This
therfore is the true meaning of
thaforesayd text. Wha~ soeuer y^
ministers of y^ Lordes worde de+clare
vnto me y^ swete promises
of God y^ father made to me in
Christes bloud,Note.  I beleue the~,
tha~ are my sinnes forgeuen me
at y^ very instau~t, but if I do not
beleue the~, than are my synnes
retayned, y^ is to saye, not for|geue~.
And forasmuch as I ey|ther
repe~t  beleue, or els co~ti|new
still in myne olde da~nable
state, at the preaching of y^ Lor|des
ministers, therfore y^ scrip|ture
attributeth my deliuerau~s

from synne or otherwyse to the~,
whan notwithstandynge God
alone remitteth my synne, if I
repent and beleue. If I do not,
the vncircumcision of my hert,
that is, my incredulitie and vn+faithfulnes
is the occasion that
my sinnes are retained and not
forgeuen. For thys sayinge al|waye
muste nedes avyde true,
thy destruccio~, o Israel, cometh
of thy selfe, onely of me cometh
thy helpe and saluacion. So y^t
the priestes (I meane the mini|sters
of Gods worde) are coun|ted
to forgeue synne, whan they
preache to the truly repentau~te
remission of synnes thorowe
Christe, and to retayne synne,
whan they declare too the vn|faythfull
damnacion, and that
the wrath of God abydeth vpo~
them, so long as they remayne
still in their incredulitie and

vnfaythfulnes, as it is writte~,
He that beleueth not on y^ son|ne
shall not see lyfe,Ioan. i. but the
wrathe of God abydeth vpon
hym. Thus se we, that those te+te
of the holy scripture, which
the papistes alledge for y^ main+tenaunce
of their fayned  vsur+ped
power in remitting synne,
maketh nothing for their pur|pose,
if they be truly alledged 
vnderstande, accordinge to the
vayne of the holy scriptures.
The scriptures of God maye
not be rent and torne, neyther
harked nor wrested to serue the
priuate affectes of menne, but
euery text must be so weyed, po~+dered,
alledged, and vndersto~d,
that it may agre with the other
textes of the holy Bible, that al
the glory of our saluacion may
be ascribed to God alone, which
is both the beginner  finisher

of all our health, to hym there|fore
be all honour and prayse
for euer. Amen.
_NOw wil I make hast
to the laste parte ofMath. xvi.
this treatyse, which
requireth y^ I should
expresse my mynde, concernyng
the keyes, which Christe before
hys passion promised too hys
churche,Ioan. xx and after his resurrec|cion
performed hys promyse,
and shew by the sacred scriptu|res,
that the gyfte of the keyes
is no vayne and idle gyfte, but
a necessarie, ioyfull and confor|table
treasure. For y^e Papistes
will here obiecte, If remissio~ of
sinnes cometh from God alone
than were the keyes geuen to
the congregacio~ in vayne. But
to the entent, that I maye stop
the mouthes of y^e aduersaries,

and that they may haue no oc|casion
to barke agaynst the glo+ry
of God after this, marke wel
good Reader, what shal be spo|ken.Esa liiii.
Trueth it is y^ God alone
teacheth men hys verite by the
holy Ghoste,ere. xxxi. as it is written,Ioan. vi. Al
shal be taughte of God.Heb. viii. Again
I will poure oute of my spirite
vpon all fleshe,Ioel. ii. and youre son|nes
and your doughters shall
prophecye.ct. ii. The Psalmogra|phe
also sayeth:Psal. i. I will heare
what the Lord speaketh in me,Ioan. v. viii. .
yet will he that they shoulde
be studious of the holy scriptu|res,
bothe daye and nyghte, as
it is commaunded of Christe.
Searche the scriptures, and
also diligently heare the prea|chynge
of hys woorde, as it is
written. He that is of God,
heareth the woordes of God.
My shepe heare my voyce. E|uery
one that is of the trueth,
heareth my voyce. So in like
maner although God alone re|mitteth
all synne, yet will he y^
remission of synnes shoulde be
preached to the people, that by
this meanes they maye repent
beleue and be made whole, as
Christ testifieth,Lu. xxii . saying: It be|houed
Christ to suffer, and too
ryse agayn fro~ death the thirde
day, and that repentaunce and
remission of synnes shoulde be
preached in hys name amonge
all nacions. Faythe cometh by
hearing,  hearing by the worde
of God. For the ministers of
the gospell are the organnes 
instrume~tes of Christ, by whom
God worketh thorow his holy
spirit, health and saluacion in
so many as are predestinate vn+to
eternal lyfe. They are Gods

laborers  ministers, by whom
we beleue,. Cor. iii. eue~ as the Lord ge|ueth
euery man grace. They
are the oratours, messengers,
interpreters, Asigels, Apostles
and Embassadours of the Lord
as the Apostle sayeth, all thin|ges
are of God, which hath re|conciled
vs vnto hym selfe by
Iesu Christ, and hath geue~ vs
the office to preache the attone|ment.
For God was in Christ, 
reconciled the worlde vnto him
self,ii. Cor. v. and imputed not their sin|nes
vnto them, and among vs
hath he set vp the worde of atto+nement.
Now then are we mes|sengers
in the roume of Christ,
euen as though God exhorted
by vs. We beseche you nowe
therfore in Christes steade, that
y be at one with god.Goolat. iiii. Agayne
to the Galathians he writteth
on this manner, Ye did not

despyse nor abhorre me, but re|ceyued
me as an Aungell of
God, yea, euen as Christe Iesu.
Hereto pertayneth hys saying
to the Thessalonians,i. Thes. iiii. He that
casteth awaye vs, casteth not
awaye menne, but God, whiche
hath geuen hys holy spirit into
vs. Moyses also in tymes
paste, sayde to the people that
murmured agaynste hym,Exod. xvi. The
Lorde hath hearde your grud|gynge
and murmuryng, wher|with
ye murmure against him.
For what are we? Youre mur|muri~gs
are not against vs, but
agaynst the Lorde. So like|wise
reade we in the Gospell,Math. x.
that the Lord spake of hys mi|nisters,
Uerely, verely I saye
vnto you: He that receyueth,
wlome soeuer I shall sende,
receyueth me. And he that re|ceyueth

me, receyueth him that
also that sent me.Luc. x. Agayne he
sayeth: he that heareth you, hea+reth
me, and he that despyseth
you, despiseth me, and he that
despyseth e, despyseth hym
also that sent me. Here se we
that the ministers of Goddes
woorde, are not to be despysed,
for they are necessarye instru|mentes
vnto the health of men
and they are worthy of double
honoure, as the Apostle sayeth.
Therefore maye it be conclu|ded
that the absolucion of thei. Timo. v.
Prieste is not too be despysed,
seynge it is none other thynge,
if it be a true and Christen ab|solucion,
than the preachynge
of fre remission of oure syn|nes
in Christes name.. Cor. iii. And al|though
he y^ pla~teth, be nothing
 he that wattereth be nothing,

but God, which geueth the en|crease,
agayne, albeit the Lorde
blesseth vs with al spiritual be|nediction,
yet inasmuche as the
inestimable kyndnes  many|folde
benefytes of God toward
vs can not be knowen nor be|leued
without preachinge (for
fayth cometh by hearynge,. x. and
hearing by the worde of God)
therefore hath God appoynted
hys ministers to open  declare
vnto men those excellent miste|ries,
those confortable  ioyful
promyses of Gods mercy and
good wil towarde mankynde,
that they maye perceyue, learne
and vnderstande, what is geue~
them of the Lorde, what they
ought to beleue, how thei shuld
obtayne the giftes of God, and
lede a lyfe worthy the kyndnes
of so bounteous a father, God
also hath appoynted the mini|sters

to beget men in Christ Ie+su
by the Gospell,Luc. i. too open the
eyes of the blynde, to turne the~
from darkenes to lighte, to co~|uerte
the hertes of fathers into
children, and the disobedient to
the wysdome of the righteous.
He hath commaunded them to
preache repa~taunce and remis|sio~
of synnes in his name vntoLuce. xxiiii.
all nacions, Go youre waye,
sayeth he into the worlde vni|uersall,
and preache the gospell
to euery creature.Marc. xvi. He that bele+ueth
and is baptised, shall be
saued. He that beleueth not shal
be condemned. Moreouer he
hath geuen to his faythful mi|nisters
the keyes of the kynge|domMath. xv
of heaue~, that whatsoeuer
they loosen in earthe, maye be
also loosened in heauen. And
whatsoeuer thei bynde in earth
maye also be bounde in heaue~,

that is to saye: he hath commit|ted
to theim the office of prea|chyng
the Gospel, y^t they should
go forth into the worlde,  prea+che
vnto all men the grace and
fauoure that is geuen of God
the father for Christes sake, yea
and that thei should proclaime,
publish and set abrode vnto all
men, that so many as repent 
beleue, are losoned fro~ the cap|tiuitie
of satha~, purged fro~ syn,
deliuered fro~ death,  made en|heritours
of eternal life: Again
that so many as beleue not, re|mayne
still y^ captiues  bonde
saues of sata~,  co~tinew bou~de
in their synnes, and in the state
of damnacion, and that there|fore
thei shal dye the death, and
for euer more be damned, ex|cepte
they repent, turne and
beleue. And thus their prea|chynge
is so certeyn and sure

before God, that whatsoeuer
they pronounce, beynge con|formable
to the worde of God,
shall as certenly come to passe,
as thoughe God hym selfe had
spoken it. As for an example,
Whan soeuer the ministers 
preachers of Gods woorde in
this worlde shall declare to the
faythfull repentaunce, remis|sion
of synnes,  tell them that
they be losoned fro~ y^ captiuitie
of satha~, it is euen as certen 
sure, as though God hym selfe
had sayde these woordes vnto
them: Thy synnes are forgeue~
the. In lyke manner whan
they shall saye to the vnfayth|full,
that they remayne still
bou~de in their synne, and that
the wrathe of God abydeth
vpon them, and therefore they
shall be damned, God appro|approueth

their sayinge, and it
shal vndoubtedly come to passe
according to their preachinge.
So that whatsoeuer the mini|ster
of Gods worde sayeth, ac|cordynge
to the worde of God,
ought to be receyued w^t greate
reuerence, and take~ as an ora|ele,
sent doune from heauen, 
vndoubtedly beleued, as a ma|nifeste
and infallible veritie
of God. And this preaching of
remittyng or retaynyng sinnes
are the keyes of the kyngdome
of heauen, which Christ promy|sed
his Apostles before hys
death, as we maye se in Mat|thew,Math. xvi.
and after hys resurrectio~
performed hys promyse, as we
rede in the Gospel of saint Io|han.Ioan. xx.
And by a Metaphore
Christ calleth the preachyng of
his worde a keye. For as a keye
hath twoo properties, one too

shutte, another to open, so hath
the worde of God. It openeth
to the faythfull the treasure of
the giftes of God, grace, mercy,
fauoue, remission of synnes,
quietnes of conscience,  euer|lastyng
life, but to the vnfaith|full
it shutteth all his treasu|res,
and suffereth the~, to receiue
none of them all, so lo~g as they
persiste and remayne in theyr
incredulity and vnfaithfulnes.
These keyes are geuen too so
many, as beynge truely called
vnto the office of ministracion,
preache y^ worde of God. They
loosen, that is to say, they prea|che
to the faythfull remissio~ of
synnes by Christe. They also
bynde, that is, they declare to y^
vnfaythfull damnacion. But
he y^ preacheth not the woorde
of God,Note. can neyther bynde nor
loose, though he chale~ge neuer

so great dignitie, authoritie 
power. For Christ calleth it the
keye of knowlege.Luc. xi. And the Pro+phet
sayth, y^ lyppes of a Priest
kepe knowledge, and at hys
mouthe shall they requyre the
lawe, for he is the Aungell or
messenger of the Lorde of hoo|stes.Malach. ii
Therefore where there is
no kwlege, there is no keye.
And where there is no keye,
there is neyther openynge nor
shuttinge, that is, neyther byn|dynge
nor loosonynge. Here
let all menne iudge what is to
be thoughte of the Papistes
absolucion, whereof they crake
so muche, whiche also they sell
derely. If no remission of
synnes cometh from them, but
by preachynge Gods woorde,
it foloweth that their absolu|cion
auayleth but littel, seyng
they neuer preache, neyther the

lawe of God, nor the swete pro|myses
of hym, but onely mum|ble
a fewe woordes in the latin
tonge, yea, and this is not vn|derstanded,
so likewise many ty+mes
contrarye too the diuine
scriptures, and y^e glory of god.
Miserable doubles is that co~|gregacion,
which hath a blynd
guyde to their Curate, whiche
hath neyther the gyfte nor the
knowledge of preachynge.Mark. xv. For
if the blynde leadeth the blynd
both falle into y^e dyche. Agayn,
greately fortunate is that Pa|ryshe,
and hyghly blessed of
God, to whome a learned she|peheard
hath chaunced, which
can feede them wyth knowlege
and doctrine. Whatsoeuer
they shall heare of suche a lear|ned
and godly minister, lette
theym beleue it as a voyce co|mynge
doune frome heauen.

And so ofte as by suche a shepe|harde
remission of synnes in y^e
bloude of Christe is preached
vnto the congregation, let the~
esteme that preachinge none o|therwyse,
than if the Lord hym
self had preached it. Let them
stedfastly beleue the woorde of
God, and vndoubtedly by their
fayth throw the grace of God,
they shall obtayne remission of
all theyr synnes. Contrariwise,
i they beleue not, their synnes
are retayned and by no meanes
forgeuen. These thinges haue
I spoken, concernyng the abs|lcion
or the keyes, which con|sisteth
only in preaching Gods
worde, that the Papistes maye
haue no occasio~, iustly to barke
agaynst me, as they haue done
hytherto both for my sermons
and bkes. God forgeue them,
and sende them a better mynde.

Nowe, forasmuche as the true
and Christen absolution is no|thing
els but the preachinge of
fre deliueraunce from synne, by
y^ death of Iesu Christ, it ought
not to be contemned and despi|sed,
but rather to be receiued w^t
great humilitie and reuerence,
euen as a diuine oracle, sente
doune from the father of ligh|tes.
For no ma~ ca~ expresse,Iaco. i. how
greatly it conforteth infirme 
weake consciences, whiche are
troubled with y^ feare of Gods
iudgementes. Whan the Pro|phet
Nathan came vnto kyng
Dauid,ii. Reg. xi and rebuked hym for
sleyng Urias the Hethite,  for
taki~g his wyfe Bethsabe vnto
hys wyfe, and tolde hym howe
greatly God was angrye with
hym, and what plages shoulde
fall vpon hys house, yea, vpon
hym selfe for hys wickednes, it

is not to be doubted, but that
Dauid was stryken with a wo~|derfull
great heuynes, and his
hert pearsed with an inwarde
sorowe, insomuche that he was
righte ashamed of hym selfe, of
his faulte, of his wickednes, 
was co~pelled euen of conscie~ce
to braste out into the knowlege
of hys synne,  to saye, I haue
synned agaynst the Lorde. As
Dauid was now full of sorow,
griefe, trouble, disquietnes in
his hert,  had ioye of nothing
(vnto suche shame and confu|sion
was he broughte in hys
conscience) so likewyse it is not
to be doubted, but that he was
wonderfully reuiued, marue|louslye
restored vnto the peace
and quietnes of his conscience,
yea, and plenteously replenis|shed
with ioye in hys mynde,
whan the Prophet sayde these

wordes vnto hym: The Lorde
hath put away thy synne, thou
shalt not dye.Luc. vii. Mary magdalen
was a famous synner,  whan
she herde her vnclene conuersa+cion
rebuked by the woorde of
God, she hertely repented, and
was replenished w^t an inwarde
sorow, lamenting greatly, that
she had offended so bounteous
a Lorde  mercifull God, inso|muche
that a large fountayne
of teares folowed out of her te~|der
eyes. All this tyme vndoub+tedly
her sorow was greater tha~
it can be here expressed. But
whan she herde this conforta|ble
absolucion of our sauioure
Christe, Remittu~tur tibi peccata.
Thy synnes are forgeuen the.
Again, thy faith hath made the
safe Go thy way in peace, that
is to saye, wyth a quiete and
mery conscience. O good God,

who is able to expresse w^t howe
great ioye and singular solace
she was affected? So sure and
confortable is it to weake and
troubled consciences too heare
the swete and confortable wor|des
of our fre deliueraunce fro~
the greuous burden of ynnes
by Christes bloude.. xxiii. The thiefe
was full of great anguysh and
trouble in his conscience, whan
he hanged vpon the crosse in y^
time of Christes passion,  con|fessed
that both he  hys felowe
thefe suffered worthely, euen ac+cording
to their desertes, and in
the middes of his troubled con+science,
he cryed vnto the Lord
Christe on this maner, sayeng:
Lorde remember me, wha~ thou
comest into thy kyngdom. But
whan Christ had made him au~|swere
and sayde, Uerely I saye
vnto the, this day shalt thou be

wyth me in Paradyse, O wyth
what a quiet conscie~ce suffered
he hys paynes, and with howe
gladde an hert yelde he vp his
spirit into the ha~des of the eter|nal
father? So confortable a
thynge is it to a troubled con|science,
for to heare any thynge
that maye quiet it. Agayn wha~
blessed Peter preached vnto the
Iewes and tolde the~,Act. ii. that they
had crucifyde Christ the Lord,
the scripture sayeth, that they
were pricked in their hertes, 
sayde vnto Peter and vnto y^
other Apostles: Ye me~ and bre|thren,
what shall we do? Peter
sayde vnto them: Repent  be
baptised euery one of you, in y^
name of Iesus Christ for the re+mission
of synnes, and ye shall
receyue the gifte of the holye
Ghoste. As they were greatly
dismayde, wha~ the holy Apostle

opened vnto theim their mali|cious
fact, in sleayng Christ the
Lorde, so were they very much
conforted, whan they hearde of
sainct Peter, y^t there was hope
of theyr synnes to be forgeuen,
so that they repented theym of
their wickednes, and were bap+tised
in y^ name of Iesu Christ.
With how entier and vnspea|keable
sorow is it to be thou|ght,
that the famous and nota|ble
adulterer amo~g the Corin|thians
was ouerwhelmed,Cor. v. wha~
at y^ co~mau~deme~t of s. Paule he
was deliuered vnto satha~, exco~|municate,
put out of the christe~
company, and reputed among
them as an Ethnycke  Pub|licane?
Contrariwyse, with
what excedyng ioye was he re|plenished,
whan after hys re|pentaunce
and sorowe he heard
the swete promyses of Goods

mercy declared vnto hym, that
lygheth bent oute towarde all
synners that repent in faythe,
and afterwarde was receyued
into the company of the fayth|full
Christianes?ii. Cor. ii. I passe ouer
diuers other histories, bothe of
the olde and newe testamente,
whiche do abundantly declare,
what great conforte the fayth|ful
penite~t synners haue alway
had in hearing the confortable
promises of Gods mercy. Now
the absolucion beyng, as I said
before, nothynge elles but the
preachynge of fre deliueraunce
from synne, by the death of Ie|su
Christ (for God alone forge|ueth
synne and absolueth the
faythfull penitent) it ought not
to be contemned and despysed,
but whansoeuer the Myny|ster
of the Lordes woorde, be it
priuatly or openly, shall reherse

vnto en, the swete and con|fortable
wordes of Gods mer|cye,
towarde all them that re|pent
in fayth, they oughte too
geue earnest fayth vnto them,
beynge vndoubtedly perswa|ded,
that their synnes at that
time be assuredly forgeuen the~,.
as thoughe God hym selfe had
spoken these wordes, according
to this saying of Christ, he that
heareth you, heareth me. But it
were expedient, that al true mi|nisters
should praye that their
forme or manner of absolucion
be pure and agreable to y^ vayn
of the holy scriptures, without
the intermixtion of anye mans
authoritie, in remittinge synne
eyther of Peter, Paule, Fraun|ces,
Dominike, Benet, or anye
other, or yet of the~ selfs, agayn
y^ it be declared to the penitent
that God alone forgeueth the

synne, and that the Priestes are
but the ministers of God, too
whome he hath geue~ the keyes
of the kyngdome of heauen for
to shewe to y^ true penitent loo|soning,
that is to saye: remissio~
of their synnes, to the obstinate
and hardeharted synners byn|dyng,
that is, that they remayn
still in the daunger of damna|cion,
and shalbe damned, except
they repent  beleue. It wolde
also be prouided, that whan the
faythfull penitent is desirous
to haue hys conscience confyr|med,
stablished and conforted
with the worde of God, it shuld
not be mu~bled in the latin to~ge
as the Papistes haue hytherto
vsed in their absolucions, but
in the mother tounge, that the
Idiote and vnlearned may vn|derstande
it and be edifyed. Or
els what fayth shall he co~ceyue

in hys herte? Howe shall he re|pent?
How shall he knowe the
goodnes of God towarde syn|ners?
Howe shall he arme hym
selfe with fayth agaynst satha~,
synne and desperacion? Howe
shall he prepare hym selfe too
geue God tha~kes for his kind|nes,
and lyue worthy of his pro+fession?
God grau~t that al thin|ges
maye be done vnto hys
glory,  vnto the profit of hys
holy congregacion.
Here hast thou (moste godly
Reader) my mynde, concerning
the absolucion and forgeuenes
of synnes, which if it be exami|ned
by the scriptures of God, al
mannes doctrine set aparte, I
doubt not, but it will stande so
stronge, that the gates of hell
shall not once be able too pre|uayle
agaynst it. Farewel most
gentle Reader, and praye that

the Lordes woorde maye haue
fre passage, that y^ name of the
great God, and our sauiour Ie+su
Christe maye be glorified a|monge
all nacions, and that al
discension layde asyde, we may
agree in one faythe and one
truthe.
Amen.
Geue the glory to God
alone.
