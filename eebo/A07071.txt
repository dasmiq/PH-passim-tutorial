To the Reader.
_I Am an ill Oratour; and in truth, vse to indite more ho|nestly then eloquently, for t'is my custome to speake as I think, and write as I speake.
In plainenesse therefore vnderstand, that in some things I have willingly er|red, as in supposing a Duke of Genoa, and in taking names different from that Citties families: for which some may wittily accuse me, but my defence shall bee as honest, as many reproofes vnto mee have been most malicious. Since (I heartily protest) t'was my care to write so farre from reasonable offence, that even strangers, in whose State I layd my Scene, should not from thence draw any disgrace to any, dead or living. Yet in despight of my indevors, I vn|derstand, some have bin most vnadvisedly over-cun|ning in mis-interpreting me,  with subtilty (as deep as hell) have maliciously spread ill rumors, which springing from themselves, might to themselves have heavily returned. Surely I desire to satisfie eve|ry firme spirit, who in all his actions, proposeth to himselfe no more ends then God and vertue doe, whose intentions are alwayes simple: to such I pro|test,

that with my free vnderstanding, I have not glanced at disgrace of any, but of those, whose vn|quiet studies labor innovation, contempt of holy policie, reverent comely superiority, and establi|shed vnity: for the rest of my supposed tartnesse, I feare not, but vnto every worthy mind t'wil be ap|prooved so generall and honest, as may modestly passe with the freedome of a Satyre. I would faine leave the paper; onely one thing afflicts mee, to thinke that Scenes invented, meerely to be spoken, should be inforcively published to be read,  that the least hurt I can receive, is to do my selfe the wrong. But since others otherwise would doe me more, the least inconvenience is to be accepted. I have my selfe therefore set forth this Comedy; but so, that my inforced absence must much relye vp|on the Printers discretion: but I shal intreat, slight errors in orthography may bee as slightly or'e|passed; and that the vnhandsome shape which this trifle in reading presents, may bee pardoned, for the pleasure it once afforded you, when it was pre|sented with the soule of lively action.

THE MALCONTENT.
ACTVS PRIMVS.
Vexat cen|sua colum|bs.

SCE. PRIMA.
The vilest out of tune Musicke being heard.
Entr Bilioso and Praepasso.

Bilioso.
_WHy how now? are yee mad? or drunke? or both? or what?


Prae.
Are yee building Babilon there?



Heer's a noyse in Court you thinke you are in a Tauerne, do you not?


Prp.
You thinke you are in a brohell house doe you not? This roome is ill sented.
Enter one with a Perfume.
So; perfume; perfume; some vpon me I pray thee: The Duke is vpon instant entrance; so, make place there.



SCENA SECVNDA.
Enter the Duke Pietro, Ferrardo, Count Equato, Count Celso before, and .

Pietro.
Where breath's that Musique?


Bilioso.
The discord rather then the Musique is heard from the Malcontent Maleuoles  


Ferrar.
Maleuole.


Male.
Out of his Chamber. Yaugh, godaman what do'st thou there: Dukes Ganimed Iunces iealous of thy long stockings: shadow of a woman, what wouldst Weesell? thou lambe a Court: what doost thou bleat for? a you smooth chind Caamite.


Pietro.
Come downe thou rugged Cur, and snarle here, I giue thy dogged sullennesse free liberty: trot about and be-spurtle whom thou pleasest.



Maleuole.
Ile come among you, you Gotish bloudded Toderers, as Gum into Taffata, to fret, to fret: Ile fall like a spunge into water to suck vp; to suck vp. Howle againe. Ile pray, and come to you.


Pietr.
This Maleuole is one of the most prodigious af|fections that euer conuerst with nature; A man or rather a monster; more discontent then Lucifer when he was thrust out of the presence, his appetite is vnsatiable as the Graue; as farre from any content as from heauen, his highest de|light is to procure others vexation, and therein hee thinkes he truly seues heauen; for tis his position, whosoeuer in this arth can be contented is a slaue and dam'd; therefore do's he afflict all in that to which they are most affected; the Elements struggle within him; his owne soule is at vari|ence; his speach is halter-worthy at all howers; I like him faith, he giues good intelligence to my spirit, makes me vn|derstand those weaknesses which others flattery palliate: harke they sing.



SCENA TERTIA.
A Song.
Enter Maleuole after the Song.
See he comes; now shall you heare the extremity of a Malecontent: he is as free as ayre; he blowes ouer euery man. And sir whence come you now?

Mal.
From the publick place of much dissimulation;


Piet.
What didst there?


Mal.
Talke with a Vsurer; take vp at Intetest.


Piet.
I wonder what religion thou art?


Mal.
Of a Souldiers religion.


Pietr.
And what doost thou thinke makes most Infidels now?


Mal.
Sects, sects, I haue seene seeming Piety change her roabe so oft, that sure none but some arch-diuell can shape her a new Peticote.



Pietro.
Of a religious pollicie.


Mal.
But damnation on a politique religion.


Pietro.
But whats the common newes abroade Maleuole, thou dogst rumor still.


Mal.
Common newes? why common words are, God saue yee, Fare yee well: common actions, Flattery and Co|senage: common things, Women and Cuckolds: and how do's my little Ferrard: a yee lecherous Animall, my little Ferret, he goes sucking vp  downe the Pallace into euery Hens nest like a Weesell:  to what doost thou addict thy time to now, more then to those Antique painted drabs that are stil affected of young Courtiers, Flattery, Pride Venry.


Ferrard.
I study languages: who doost thinke to be the best linguist of our age?


Mal.
Phew, the Diuell let him possesse thee, heele teach thee to speake all languages, most readily and strangely, and great reason mary, hees traueld greatly ithe worlde; and is euery where.


Ferrard.
Saue ith Court.


Ml.
I saue ith Court: and how do's my old Muckill ouerspred with fresh snow thou halfe a ma~ halfe a Goate,To Bilios. all a Beast: how do's thy young wife old huddle?


Bili.
Out you improuident rascall.


Mal.
Doe, kick thou hugely hornd olde Dukes Oxe, good Maister Make-pleece.


Pietro.
How doost thou liue now a dayes Maleuole?


Mal.
Why like the Knight S. Patrik Penlobrans, with killing a Spiders for my Ladies Munckey.


Pie.
How do'st spend the night, I heere thou neuer sleepst?


Mal.
O no, but dreame the most fantasticall: O heauen: O fubbery, fubbery.


Pietro.
Dreame, what dreamst?


Mal.
Why me thinkes I see that Signior pawnd his foot|cloth, that Metreza her Plate, this madam takes phisick, that tother Mounsieur may minister to her: here is a Pandar Iew|eld: there a fellow in shift of Satten this day, that could not shift a shirt tother night, here a Paris supports that Hellen,

theres a Lady Guineuer beares vp that sir Lancelot. Dreames, dreames, visions, fantasies, Chimeras, imaginations, trickes, conceites, To Pre|pass. Sir Tristram Trimtram come a loft lacke a napes with a whim wham, heres a Knight of the land of Catito shall play at trap with any Page in Europe; Doe the sword daunce, with any Morrisdauncer in Christendome; ride at the Ring till the finne of his eyes looke as blew as the welkin, and runne the wilde-goose chase euen with Pompey the huge.


Pietro.
You runne.


Mal.
To the diuell: now Signor Guerchino; that thou from a most pittied prisoner shouldst grow a most loathd flatterer: Alas poore Celso, thy starres opprest, thou art an ho|nest Lord, tis pitty.


Equato.
Ist pitty?


Mal.
I marry ist Philosophicall Equato, and tis pitty that thou being so excellent a Scholler by Art, shouldst be so ri|culous a foole by Nature: I haue a thing to tell you Duke; bid vm auant, bid vm auant.


Pietro.
Leaue vs, leaue vs, now sir what ist?

Exeunt all sauing Pietro and Maleuole

Mal.
Duke thou art a Beco, a Cornto.


Pietro.
How?


Mal.
Thou art a Cuckold.


Pietro.
Speake; vnshale him quick.


Mal.
With most tumbler-like nimblenes.


Pietro.
Who? by whom? I burst with desire.


Mal.
Mendozo is the man makes thee a horn'd beast; Duke 'tis Mendozo cornutes thee.


Pietro.
What conformance, relate, short, short.


Mal.
As a Lawyers beard,

There is an old Crone in the Court, her name is Maquerelle,
Shee is my Mistris sooth to say, and she doth euer tell me,

Blirt a rime; blirt a rime; Maquerelle is a cunning Bawde, I am an honest villaine, thy wife is a close Drab, and thou art a notorious Cuckold, farewell Duke.



Pietro.
Stay stay.


Mal,
Dull, dull Duke, can lazy patience make lame re|uenge; O God for a woman to make a man that which God neuer created, neuer made.


Pietro.
What did God neuer make?


Mal.
A Cockold: To be made a thing thats hud-winkt with kindnesse whilst euery rascall philips his browes; to haue a Cox-combe with egregious hornes pind to a Lords back, euery page sporting himselfe with delightfull laugh|ter, whilst he must be the last must know it; Pistols and Po|niards, Pistols and Poinards.


Pietro.
Death and damnation.


Mal.
Lightning and thunder.


Pietro.
Vengeance and torture.


Mal.
Catzo.


Pietro.
O reuenge.


Mal.
I would dam him and all his generation, my owne hands should do it; ha I would not trust heauen with my vengeance any thing.


Pietro.
Any thing, any thing Maleuole thou shalt see in|stantly what temper my spirit houlds; farewell, remember, I forget thee not, farewell.

Exit Pietro.


SCENA QVARTA.
Enter Celso.

Cel.
My honor'd Lord.


Mal.

Peace, speake low; peace, O Celso, constant Lord,
Thou to whose faith I onely rest discouered,
Thou one of full ten millions of men
That louest vertue onely for it selfe,
Thou in whose hands olde OPS may put her soule;
Behold for euer banisht Altofront
This Genoas last yeares Duke. O truly noble,
I wanted those old instruments of state,
Dissemblance, and suspect: I could not time it Celso,
My throane stood like a point in midd'st of a circle,
To all of equall neerenes, bore with none:
Raind all alike, so slept in fearelesse vertue,
Suspectles, too suspectles, till the crowde:
(Still liquerous of vntried nouelties)
Impacient with seuerer gouernmente:
Made strong with Florence: banisht Altofront.



Celso.

Strong with Florence, I thence your mischiefe rose,
For when the danghrer of the Florentine:
Was matched once with this Pietro now Duke,
No stratagem of state vntide was lefte, till you of all



Mal.

Of all was quite berefte,
Alas Maria too close prisoned:
My true sayth'd dutches i'the Citadell.



Celso.
Ile still adhere, lets mutinie and die.


Mal.

O clime nota falling tower Celso,
Tis well held desperation, no Zeale:
Hopeles to striue with fate (peace) Temporize.
Hope, hope, that neuer forsak'st the wretchedst man,
Yet bidst me liue, and lurke in this disguise,
What play I well the ree breath'd discontent,

Why man we are all philosophicall monarkes or naturall fooles, Celso the Courtes a ar, the dutches sheets will smoke forth ere it be long: Impure Mendozo that sharpe nos'd Lord, that made the cursed match linkt Genoa with Florence now brode hornes, the Duke which he now knowes: Dis|cord to malecontents is very Manna, when the rankes are burst then scuffle Altophant.


Celso.
I but durste.


Mal.
Tis gone, tis swallowed like a minerall, some way twill worke, phewt ile not shrinke, 
Hees resolute who can no lower sinke.


Celso.
Yonder's Mendoza.


Mal.
True, the priuie key.


Celso.
I take my leaue sweete Lord.

Exit Celso.

Mal.
Tis fit, away.




SCENA QVINTA.
Enter Mendoza with three or foure sutors.

Mend.
Leaue your suites with me, I can and will: attend my secretarie, leaue me.


Mal.
Mendoza harke yee, harke yee, You are a treache|rous villaine, God buye yee.


Mend.
Out you base borne rascall.


Ml.
We are all the sonnes of heauen though a Tripe wife were our mother; a you whore-sonne hot rainde hee Marmoset, Egistus didst euer here of one Egistus?


Mend.
Gistus?


Mal.
I Egistus, he was a filthy incontinent Fleshmonger, such a one as thou art.


Mend.
Out grumbling roage.


Mal.
Orestes, beware Orestes.


Mend.
Out beggar.


Mal.
I once shall rise,


Mend.
Thou rise?


Mal.

I at the resurrection.
No vulgar seede but once may rise and shall,
No King so huge, but fore he die may fall.


Exit.

Mend.
Now good Elizium, what a delicious heauen is it for a ma~ to be in a Princes fauour?  sweet God,  pleasure!  Fottune!  all thou best of life? what should I thinke? what say? what do? to be a fauorite? a minion? to haue a generall timerous respect obserue a man, a statefull sci|lence in his presence: solitarinesse in his absence, a con|fused ham and busie murmure of obsequious suters trai|ning him; the cloth held vp, and waye proclaimd before him; Petitionarie vassailes licking the pauement with their slauish knees, whilst some odde pallace Lampree|les that ingender with Snakes, and are full of eyes on both sides with a kinde of insinuating humblenesse fixe all their lights vpon his browe: O blessed state what a

rauishing prospect doth the Olympus of fauor yeeld; Death, I cornute the Duke: sweete women, most sweet Ladies, nay Angels; by heauen he is more accursed then a Diuell that hates you, or is hated by you, and happier then a God that loues you, or is beloued by you; you preseruers of mankind, life blood of society, who would liue, nay who can liue without you? O Paradice, how maiesticall is your austerer presence? how imperiouslie chaste is your more modest face? but O! how full of rauishing attraction is your pretty, petulant, languishing, laciuiously-composed countenance: these amarous smiles, those soule-warming sparkling glan|ces; ardent as those flames that sing'd the world by heedlesse Phaeton; in body how delicate, in soule how witty, in dis|course how pregnant, in life how wary, in fauours how iu|dious, in day how sociable, and in night how? O pleasure vntterable, indeed it is most certaine, one man cannot de|serue onely to inioy a beautious woman: but a Dutches? in dispight of Phoebus Ile write a Sonnet instantly in praise of her.

Exit.


SCENA SEXTA.
Enter Farnese vshering Aurelia, Emillia and Maquerelle bearing vp her traine, Beancha attending: all goe out but Aurelia, Maquerelle and Farneze.

Aure.
And ist possible? Mendozo slight me, possible?


Far.

Possible? what can be strange in him thats drunke with fauour,
Groes insolent with grace, speake Maquerelle, speake.



Maque.
To speake feelingly, more, more richely in sollid sence then worthlesse words, giue me those Iewels of your eares to receiue my inforced dutie, as for my part tis well knowne I can put vp any thing; can beare patiently with any man: But when I heard hee wronged your pretious sweetnesse, I was inforced to take deepe offence; Tis most certaine he loues Emillia with high appetite; and as she told

me (as you knowe we woemen impart our secrets one to a|nother) when she repulsed his suite, in that he was possessed with your indeered grace: Mendozo most ingratfully re|nounced all fayth to you.


Fer.
Nay, cald you, speake Maquerelle, speake.


Maq.
By heauen witch? dride bisquet, and contested blushlesly hee lou'd you but for a spurt or soe.


Fer.
For maintenance.


Maq.
Aduancement and regarde.


Aur.
O villaine? O impudent Mendozo.


Maq
Nay he is the rustiest iawde, the fowlest mouthd knaue in rayling against our sex: he will rayle agen women.


Aur.
How? how?


Maq.
I am asham'd to speakt, I.


Aur.
I loue to hate him, speake.


Maq.
Why when Emillia scornde his base vnsteddines the blacke throated rascall scoulded, and sedd.


Aur.
What?


Maq.
Troth tis too shamelesse,


Aur.
What saide he?


Maq.
Why that at foure women were fooles, at foure|teene Drabbes, at fortie Bawdes, at fourescore witches, and a hundreth Cats.


Aur.
O vnlimitable impudencie!


Fer.

But as for poore Fernezes fixed hart,
Was neuer shadelesse meadow drier parcht,
Vnder the scortching heate of heauens dog,
Then is my hart with your inforcing eyes.



Maq.
A hotte simile.


Fer.

Your smiles haue bin my heaue~, your frownes my hel,
O pitty then; Grace should with beauty d well.



Maq.
Reasonable perfect bir-lady.


Aur.

I will loue thee, be it but in dispight,
Of that Mendozo, witch! Farneze, witch!
Ferneze thou art the Dutches fauorite,
Be faithfull, priuate, but tis dangerous,




Fer.

His loue is liuelesse, that for loue feares breath,
The worst thats due to sinne, O would't were death.



Aur.

Enioy my fauor, I wil be sick instantly  take phisick,
Therefore in depth of night, visit



Maq.
Visit her chamber, but conditionally you shall not offend her bed: by this Diamond.


Fer.
By this Diamond.

Giues it to Maquerelle.

Maq.
Nortary longer then you please: by this Ruby.


Fer.
By this Ruby.


Maq.
And that the doore shall not creake.


Fer.
And that the doore shall not creake.


Mal.
Nay but sweare.


Ferne.
By this purse.


Maq.
Goe to, Ile keepe your oathes for you: remem|ber, visit.

Enter Mendozo reading a Sonnet.

Aur.
Dry'd bisquet? looke where the base wretch comes.


Men.
Beauties life, Heauens modell, Loues Queene.


Maq.
Thats his Aemilia.


Men.
Natures triumph, best of Earth.


Maq.
Meaning Emillia.


Mend.
Thou onely wonder that the world hath seene.


Maq.
Thats Emilia.


Aur.
Must I then here her praisd? Mendozo.


Mend.
Madam, your excellency is gratiously incountred; I haue bin writing passionate flashes in honor of

Exit Fer.

Aur.
Out villaine, villaine, O iudgement where haue bin my eies? what bewitched election made me doate on thee? what sorcery made me loue thee? but be gone, bury thy head; O that I could doe more then loath thee: Hence worst of ill, No reason else, my reason is my will.

Exit with Maquer.

Mend.
Women? nay furies, nay worse, for they torment Onely the bad, but women good and bad.
Damnation of mankinde, breath hast thou praisd them for this: And ist you Ferneze are wrigled into smock grace; fit

sure, O that I could raile against these monsters in nature, models of hell, curse of the earth, women that dare attempt any thing, and what they attempt they care not how they accomplish, without all premeditation or preuention; rashe in asking, desperate in working, impatient in suffering, ex|treame in desiring, slaues vnto appetite, mistresses in dissem|bling, onely constant in vnconstancie, onely perfect in cou~|terfetting: their words are fained, their eyes forg'd, their sights dissembled, their lookes counterfeit, their haire false, their giuen hopes deceitfull, their very breath artificiall:
Their blood is their onely God: Bad clothes, and old age are onely the Diuels they tremble at:
That I could raile now.



SCENA SEPTIMA.
Enter Pietro his sworde drawne.

Pietro.
A mischiefe fill thy throate, thou fowle iaw'd slaue Say thy prayers.


Mend.
I ha forgot vm.


Pietro.
Thou shalt dye.


Mend.
So shalt thou; I am hart mad.


Pietro.
I am horne mad.


Mend.
Extreame mad.


Pietro.
Monstrously mad.


Mend.
Why?


Pietro.
Why? thou thou hast dishonored my bed.


Mend.
I? come, come, sit, heeres my bare heart to thee as steddy as is this center to this glorious world,
And yet harke thou art a Cornuto; but by me?


Pietro.
Yes slaue by thee.


Mend.

Do not, do not with tart and spleenefull breath,
Loose him can loose thee; I offend my Duke?
Bare record O yee dumbe and raw aird nights,
How vigilant my sleeplesse eyes haue bin,
To watch the Traitor; record thou spirit of truth,
With what debasement I ha throne my selfe,
To vnder offices, onely to learne
The truth, the party, time, the meanes, the place,
By whom, and when and where thou wert disgrac'd:
And am I paid with slaue? hath my intrusion
To places priuate, and prohibited,
Onely to obserue the closer passages:
Heauen knowes with vowes of reuelation,
Made me suspected, made me deemd a villaine?
What roage hath wronged vs?



Pietro.
Mendozo, I may erre.


Mend.

Erre? tis too mild a name, but erre and erre,
Runne giddy with suspect, fore through me thou know,
That which most creatures saue thy selfe doe know,
Nay since my seruice hath so loath'd reiect,
Fore Ile reueale, shalt finde them clipt together.



Piet.
Mendozo thou knowst I am a most plaine brested ma~.


Mend.
The fitter to make a Cornuto, would your browes were most plane to.


Piet.
Tell me, indeed I heard thee raile?


Mend.

At wome~, true, why what cold fleame could chose,
Knowing a Lord so honest, vertuous,
So boundlesse louing, bounteous, faire shapt, sweete,
To be contemn'd, abus'd, defam'd, made Cuckold,

Hart, I hate all women for't: sweete sheetes, waxe lights, Antique bed-posts, Cambrick smocks, villanous curtaines, Arras pictures, oylde hinges, and all yee tong-tide lasciuious witnesses of great creatures wantonnesse: what saluation can you expect?


Piet.
Wilt thou tell me?


Mend.
Why you may find it your selfe, obserue, obserue.


Piet.
I ha not the patience, wilt thou deserue me; tell, giue it.


Mend.
Tak't, why Farneze is the man, Ferneze, Ile proou't, this night you shall take him, in your sheets, wilt serue.



Piet.
It will, my bozomes in some peace, till night.


Mend.
What?


Piet.
Farewell.


Mend.

God how weake a Lord are you,
Why doe you thinke there is no more but so?



Piet.
Why?


Mend.

Nay then will I presume to councell you,
It should be thus; you with some garde vpon the suddaine
Breake into the Princes chamber, I stay behinde
Without the doore, through which he needs must passe,
Ferneze flies, let him, to me he comes, hee's kild
By me, obserue by me, you follow, I raile,
And seeme to saue the body: Dutches comes
On whom (respecting her aduanced birth,
And your faire nature) I know, nay I doe know
No violence must be vsed. She comes, I storme,
I praise, excuse Ferneze, and still maintaine
The Dutches honor, she for this loues me,
I honor you, shall know her soule, you mine,
Then naught shall she contriue in vengeance,
(As women are most thoughtfull in reuenge)
Of her Ferneze, but you shall sooner know't
Then she can think't, thus shall his death come sure,
Your Dutches braine-caught; so your life secure.



Piet.

It is too well, my bozome, and my hart,
When nothing helpes, cut of the rotten part.


Exit.

Mend.
Who cannot faine friendship, can nere produce the effects of hatred: Honest foole Duke, subtile lasciuious Dutches, silly nouice ferneze; I doe laugh at yee, my braine is in labour till it produce mischiefe,  I feele sudden thro's, proofes sencible, the issue is at hand.

As Beares shape young, so Ile forme my deuice,
Which growne prooues horrid: Vengeance makes men wise.






ACTVS SECVNDVS.

SCE. PRIMA.
Enter Mendozo with a Scene, to obserue Fernezes entrance, who whilst the Act is playing: Enter vnbraced 2. Pages before him with lights, is met by Maquerelle and conuaide in. The Dutches Pages sent away.

Men.

Hee's caught, the Woodcocks head is i'th noose,
Now treads Ferneze in daungerous path of lust,
Swearing his sence is meerely deified.
The foole grasps clowds, and shall beget Centaures.
Aud now in strength of panting faint delight,
The Goate bids heauen enuie him; good Goose,
I can afforde thee nothing but the poore co~fort of calamity, Pitty.
Lusts like the plummets hanging on clock lines,
Will nere a done till all is quite is vndone.
Such is the course salt sallow lust doth runne.
Which thou shalt trie; Ile be reueng'd. Duke thy suspect,
Dutches thy disgrace, Ferneze thy riuall-ship,
Shall haue swift vengeance, nothing so holy,
No band of nature so strong,
No law of friendship so sacred,
But ile prophane, burst, violate
Fore ile indure disgrace: contempt and pouertie:
Shall I whose very humme, strooke all heads bare,
Whose face made scilence: creaking of whose shooe,
Forc'd the most priuate passages flie ope,
Scrape like a seruile dog at some latch'd doore?
Learne now to make a leg? and cry beseech yee,
Pray yee is such a Lord within? be aw'd
At some odde vshers scoft formality?
First seare my braines: Unde cadis non quo refert.
My hart cries perish all, how? how? what fate?
Can once auoide reuenge, thats desperate,
Ile to the Duke, if all should ope, if? tush
Fortune still dotes on those who cannot blush.





SCENA SECVNDA.
Enter Maleuole at one doore, Beancha, Emillia and Maquerelle at the other doore.

He that will inflame a yonge wenches hart, let him lay close to her, an ould Cole that hath first bin fierd a pandresse, my halfe burnt lynt, who though thou canst not flame thy selfe yet art able to set a 1000. virgins tapers a fiar: and how do's Ianiuere thy husband, my little periwincle: is a trobled with the cough a the Lunges still, does he hawke anights still, he will not bite.

And he~ tooke thee with thy belly ful of yong bones, marry he tooke his maime by the stroake of his enemie.


Bean.

Beanc.

Mal.

Maq.
In good indeed law now, to eate the most mira|culously, admirably, astonishable compos'd Posset with three Curds, without any drinke: will yee helpe me with a Hee Fox: heer's the Duke.

Exeunt Ladies.



SCENA TERTIA.
Enter Duke Pietro, Count Celso, Count Equato, Bilioso, Ferrard, and Mendozo.

Piet.
The night growes deepe and fowle, what houre ist?


Celso.
Vpon the stroake of twelue.


Mal.
Saue yee Duke.


Piet.
From thee, begone I do not loue thee, let me see thee no more, we are displeasd.


Mal.

Why God buy thee, heauen heare my curse,
May thy wife and thee liue long together.



Piet.
Be gone sirra.


Mal.
When Arthur first in Court began,Agamennon, Menelaus,was euer any Duke a Cornuto,


Piet.
Begon hence.


Mal.
What religion wilt thou be of next?


Mend.
Out with him.


Mal.

With most seruile patience, time will come,
When wonder of thy error will strike dumbe,
Thy beseld sence, slaues I fauour, I marry shall he rise,
Good God how subtile Hell doth flatter vice,
Mount him aloft, and makes him seeme to flie,
As foule the Tortois mockt: who to the skie,
Th'ambitious shell fish rais'd, th'end of all,
Is onely that from height he might dead fall.


Exit.

Piet.
It shall be so.


Mend.

It must be so, for where great States reuenge,
Tis requisite, the parts with piety
And soft respect forbeares, be closely dogd,
Lay one into his breast shall sleepe with him,
Feede in the same dish, run in selfe faction,
Who may disseuer any shape of danger,
For once disgrac'd, discouered in offence,
It makes man blushlesse, and man is (all confesse)
More prone to vengeance then to gratefulnesse.
Fauours are writ in dust, but stripes we feele,
Depraued nature stamps in lasting steele.



Piet.
You shalbe leauged with the Dutches.


Equat.
The plot is very good.


Mend.
You shall both kill, and seeme the course to saue.


Ferrard.
A most fine braine trick.


Celso.
Of a most cunning knaue.


Pietro.

My Lords: The heauy action we intend
Is death and shame, two of the vgliest shapes
That can confound a soule, thinke, thinke of it;
I strike but yet like him that gainst stone walles,
Directs his shaftes, rebounds in his owne face,
My Ladies shame is mine, O God, tis mine.
Therefore I do coniure all secresie,
Let it be as very little as may be; pray yee, as may be;
Make frightlesse entrance, salute her with soft eyes,
Staine naught with blood, onely Ferneze dyes,
But not before her browes: O Gentlemen
God knowes I loue her, nothing els, but this
I am not well; if griefe that sucks veines drye,
Riuels the skinne, casts ashes in mens faces,
Be-duls the eye, vnstrengthens all the blood,
Chance to remooue me to an other world,
As sure I once must dye: let him succeed:
I haue no childe, all that my youth begot,
Hath bin your loues, which shall inherit me,
Which as it euer shall, I doe coniure it
Mendozo may succeed, hees nobly borne;
With me of much desert.



Celso.
Much.


Pietro.

Your silence answeres I,
I thanke you, come on now,  that I might dye,
Before her shames displaide, would I were forst
To burne my fathers Tombe; vnhill his boanes,
And dash them in the durt, rather then this:
This both the liuing and the dead offends,
Sharpe surgery where nought but death amends.


Exit with others.


SCENA QVARTA.
Enter Maquerelle, Emillia and Beanca, with a Posser.

Maq.

Euen here it is, three curds in three regions indiui|duallie distinct,
Most methodically according to art composd, without a|ny drinke.



Bean.
Without any drinke.


Maq.
Vpon my honour, will yee sit and eate.


Emil.
Good the composure the receie, how ist:


Maq.
Tis a pretty pearle, by this pearle, (how dost with me) thus it is, seauen and thirty volks of Barbarie hennes eggs, eighteene spoonfulles and a halfe of the Ioice of cock|sparrowe bon s, one ounce, three drams, oure scruples, and one quarte of the Sirrop of Ethiopian Dates, sweetned with three quarters of a pound of pure Candid Indian , strow'd ouer with the powder of Pearle of America, Amber of Cataia, and Lambe stones of .


Bean.
Trust me the ingredients are very Cordiall, and no question god, and most powerfull in operation.


Maq.
I know not what you meane by restauracion, but this it doth, it purifieth the blood, smootheth the skinne, i|lifeneth the eye, strengthneth the vaines mundefieth the teeth, comforteth the stomacke, fortifieth the backe, and quickneth the wi, thats all.


Emil
By my troth I haue eaten but two spoonefuls, and me thinkes I could discourse most swiftly, and wittily al|ready.


Maq.
Haue you the art to seeme honest.


Bean.
I thanke aduise and practise.



Maq.
Why then eate me a this posset, quicken your blood, and preserue your beauty, doe you knowe Doctor Plaster-face, by this curd he is the most exquisite in forging of veines, sprightning of eyes, dying of haire, sleeking of skinnes, blushing of cheeks, surpheling of brests, blanching and bleaching of teeth, that euer made an ould ladie grati|ous by torch-light: by this curd law.


Bean.
Well we are resolu'd, what God has giuen vs weell cherish.


Maq.
Cherish any thing sauing your husband, keepe him not too high least he leape the pale: but for your beauty, let it be your Saint, bequeath two howers to it euery morning in your closet, I ha bin yong, and yet in my conscience I am not aboue fiue and twenty, but beleeue me, preserue and vse your beauty, for youth and beautie once gone, we are like Beehiues without honey: out a fashion, apparell that no man will weare, therefore vse me your beauty.


Emil.
I but men say.


Maq.
Men say, let men say what the will, life a woman, they are ignorant of our wants, the more in yeeres the more in perfection the grow: if they loose youth and beauty, they gaine wisdome and discretion: But when our beauty fades, godnight with vs, there cannot be an vglier thing to see then an ould woman, from which,  pruning, pinching, and painting, deliuer all sweete beauties.


Bean.
Harke musique.


Maq.
Peace tis ithe Dutches bed-chamber, good rest most prosperously grac'd ladies.


Emil.
God night centinell.


Bean,

Exeunt at seuerall dores.

And me your youth and beauty, the pleasingst rest.

Must haue broad hands, close hart with Argos eyes,
And back of Hercules, or els he dyes.


Enter Aurelia, Duke Pietro, Ferrard, Bilioso, Celso and Equato.

Stand off, forbeare, yee most vnciuill Lords.Mendozo bestrids the vvounded body of Fer|neze and seemes to saue him.


Piet.

Would you inhumane murtherers more then death?



Aur.
O poore Ferneze.


Mend.
Alas now all defence too late.


Aur.
Hee's dead.


Piet.

I am sory for our shame, goe to your bed,
Weepe not too much, but leaue some teares to shed
When I am dead?



Aur.
What weepe for thee? my soule no teares shall find.


Piet.
Alas, alas, that womens soules are blind.


Mend.

Betraye such beauty? murther such youth? con|temne ciuilitie,
He loues him not that railes not at him.



Piet.

Thou canst not mooue vs, we haue blood inough;
And please you Lady we haue quite forgot
All your defects: if not, why then



Aur.
Not.


Piet.
Not: the best of rest, good night.

Exit Pietro with other Courtiers.

Aur.
Despight goe with thee.


Mend.

Madam, you ha done me soule disgrace,
You haue wrongd him much, loues you too much.
Goe to; your soule knowes you haue.



Aur.
I thinke I haue.


Mend.
Do you but thinke so?


Aur.

Nay sure I haue, my eyes haue witnessed thy loue,
Thou hast stood too firme for me.



Mend.

Why tell me faire checkt Lady, who euen in teares
Art powerfully beautious, what vnaduised passion
Strooke yee into such a violent heate against me,
Speake, what mischiefe wrongd vs? what diuell iniur'd vs?
Speake?



Aur.

That thing nere worthy of the name of ma~; Ferneze,
Ferneze swore thou lou'st Emillia,
Which to aduance, with most reprochfull breath,
Thou both didst blemish and denounce my loue.



Mend.

Ignoble Villaine, did I for this bestride
Thy wounded limbs; for this? ranck opposite
Euen to my Soueraigne: for this? O God for this?
Sunke all my hopes, and with my hopes my life,
Ript bare my throate vnto the hangmans Axe,
Thou most dishonour'd trunkeEmillia?
By life I know her notEmillia?
Did you beleeue him?



Aur.
Pardon me, I did.


Mend.
Did you, and therevpon you graced him?


Aur.
I did.


Mend.
Tooke him to fauour, nay euen claspd with him?


Aur.
Alas I did.


Mend.
This night?


Aur.
This night.


Mend.
And in your lustfull twines the Duke tooke you?



Aur.
A most sad truth.


Mend.

O God, O God, how we dull honest soules,
Heauy braind men, are swallowed in the bogs
Of a deceitfull ground, whilst nimble bloods,
Light iointed spirits pent, cut good mens throats,
And scape alas, I am too honest for this age,
Too full of fleame and heauy steddinesse:
Stood still whilst this slaue cast a noose about me;
Nay then to stand in honor of him, and her,
Who had euen slic'd my hart.



Aur.
Come I did erre, and am most sorry, I did erre.


Mend.
Why we are both but dead, the Duke hates vs,

''And those whome Princes doe once groundly hate,
''Let them prouide to dye; as sure as fate,
''Preuention is the hart of pollicie.



Aur.
Shall we murder him.


Mend.
Instantly?


Aur.

Instantly, before he casts a plot,
Or further blaze my honours much knowne blot,
Lets murther him?



Mend.
I would do much for you, will ye marry me?


Aur.

Ile make thee Duke, we are of Medices,
Florence our friend, in court my faction
Not meanly strength full; the Duke then dead,
We well prepar'd for change, the multitude
Irresolutely reeling, we in force,
Our partie seconded, the kingdome mazde,
No doubt of swift successe all shalbe grac'd.



Mend.

You do confirme me, we are resolute,
To morrow looke for change, rest confident,
Tis now about the immodest waste of night,
The mother of moist dew with palld light,
Spreds gloomy shades about the nummed earth,
Sleepe, sleepe, whilst we contriue our michiefes birth,
This man ile get inhum'de, farewell, to bed,
I kisse thy pillow dreame, the duke is dead. Exit Aurelia.
So, so, good night, how fortune dotes on impudence,
I am in priuate the adopted sonne of yon good Prince,
I must be Duke, why if I must, I must,
Most silly Lord, name me? O heauen
I see God made honest fooles, to maintaine craftie knaues:
The dutches is wholy mine too; must kill her husband
To quit her shame, mutch: then marry her: I,
O  grow prowd in prosperous trecherie,
As wrestlers clip, so ile imbrac you all,
Not to support, but to procure your fall.


Enter Maleuole.

Mal.
God arrest thee.


Mend.
At whose suite?


Mal.

At the diuels, ha you treacherous damnable monster,
How doost how doost thou treacherous roage,
Ha ye rascall, I am banish the Court, Sirra.



Mend.
Pethee lets be acquainted, I do loue thee faith.


Mal.
At your seruice, by the Lord law, shals go to supper, Lets be once drunke together and so vnite a most vertu|ously strengtned friendship, shals Hgonot, shals?


Mend.
Wilt ll vpon my chamber to morrow morne.


Mal.
As a Rauen to a dunghill, they say ther's one dead here pickt for the pride of the flesh.


Mend
Fernez: there he is, prey thee bury him.


Mal.
O most willingly, I meane to turne pure Rochell Churchman, I.


Mend.
Thou Churchman, why? why?


Mal
Because ile liue lazely, faile vpon authoritie, deny Kings supremacie in things indifferent, and bee a Pope in mine owne parish.


Mend.
Wherefore doo'st thou thinke Churches were made?


Mal.
To scoure Plough shar    plough vp Altars:

Et nunc ges  

Mend.
Strange.



Mal.
Nay monstrous, I ha seene a sumptuous steeple tur|ned to a stinking priuie: more beastly, the sacredst place made a Doggs kenill: nay most inhumane, the ston'd cof|fins of long dead Christians burst vp, and made Hogs|troughs.
Hic finis Priami.
Shall I ha some sack, and cheese at thy chamber, Good night, good mischiuous incarnate diuill, godnight Mendozo, ha, yee Inhumain villaine godnight, night fub:


Men.
God night: to morrow morne.

Exit Mendozo.

Mal.
I, I will come friendly Damnation, I will come, I doe discrie crosse-poynts, honesty, and court-ship, straddle as farre a sunder, as a true Frenchmans legges.


Ferne.
O!


Mal.
Proclamations, more proclamations.


Fer.
O a Surgion.


Mal.
Hark lust cries for a surgion, what news from Limbe How does the graund cuckold Lucifer.


Fer.
O helpe, helpe, conceale  saue me.

Ferneze stirs  Male. helpes him vp and conuaies him away.

Mal.

Thy shame more then thy wounds do grieue me far,
''Thy woundes but leaue vpon thy flesh some skarre:
''But fame neare heales still ranckl's worse and worse,
''Such is of vncontrolled Lust the cursse.
''Thinke what it is in lawlesse sheetes to lye,
''But  Ferneze what in lust to die:
''Then thou that shame respects  flie conuerse,
''With womens eyes and lisping wantonesse:
''Stick candells gainst a virgin walles white back,
''If they not burne, yet at the least theile blacke,
Come Ile conuey thee to a priuate porte,
Where thou shalt liue (O happy man) from court.
The beautie of the daye begins to rize,
From whose bright forme Nights heauie shadow flies.
Now gins  plots to worke, the Sceane growes full,
And craues  eyes who hath a sollid Skull.


Exeunt.




ACTVS TERTIVS.

SCENA PRIMA.
Enter Pietro the Duke, Mendoz: Count Equato and Bilioso.

Piet.

Tis growne to youth of day, how shall we wast this light?
My hart's more heauie then a tyrants crowne.
Shall we goe hunt? Prepare for field.


Exit Equa.

Mend.
Would yee could be merry.


Piet.

Would God I could: Mendoza bid am hast. Exit Mendo.
I would faine shift place, O vaine reliefe.
''Sad soules may well change place, but not change griefe:
As Deere being struck flie thorow many soyles,
Yet still the shaft stick fast, so, A good old simile my honest Lord,
I am not much vnlike to some sickman,
That long desired hurtfull drinke; at last
Swilles in and drinkes his last, ending at once
Both life and thirst: O would I nere had knowne
My owne dishonor: good God, that men should
Desire to search out that, which being found kils all
Their ioye of life: to taste the tree of Knowledge,
And then be driuen from out Paradice.
Canst giue me some comfort?



Bili.
My Lord, I haue some bookes which haue beene dedicated to my honor, and I neare read am, and yet they had very fine names: Phisicke for Fortune: Lozinges of sancti|fied sincerity; very prettie workes of Curats, Scriueners and Schoolemaisters. Mary I remember one Seneca, Lucius A|neus Seneca.


Piet.
Out vpon him, he writ of Temperance and Forti|tude, yet liued like a voluptuous Epicure, and died like an effeminate coward. Hast thee to Florence: heere take our Letters, see um seald, awaye: report in priuate to the ho|nourd duke his daughters forc'd disgrace, tell him at length we know too much, due complaints aduaunce.
Theres naught thats safe and sweete but Ignorance.

Exit Duke.



SCENA SECVNDA.
Enter Maleuole in some freeze gowne whilest Bilioso reades his Patent.

Mal.

I cannot sleepe my eyes ill neighbouring lids
Will holde no fellowship: O thou pale sober night,
Thou that in sluggish fumes all sence doost steepe:
Thou that giues all the world full leaue to play,
Vnbendst the feebled vaines of sweatie labour;
The Gally-slaue, that all the toilesome day,
Tugges at his oare against the stubborne waue,
Straining his rugged vaines; snores fast:
The stooping Sheman that dooth barbe the field,
Thou makst winke sure: in night all creatures sleepe,
Onely the Malecontent, that gainst his fate,
Repines and quarrels, alas hees goodman tell-clock,
His sallow aw-bones sincke with wasting mone,
Whilst other beds are downe, his pillowes stone.



Bili.
Mal uole.


Mal.
Elder of Izrael, thou honest defect of wicked na|ture and obstinate ignorance, when did thy wife let thee lie with her?


Bili.
I am going Embassadour to Florence.


Mal.
Embassador, now for thy countries honor, preethe doe not put vp Mutton and Porredge i'thy clock bag: thy yong lady wife goes to Florence with thee too do's she not?


Bili.
No, I leaue her at the Pallace.


Mal.
At the Pallace? now discretion shield man, for Gods loue lets ha no more cuckolds, Hymen begins to put of his Saffron robe, keepe thy wife i'the state of grace, hart a truth, I would sooner leaue my lady singled in a Bordello, then in the Genoa pallace, sinne there appearing in her sluttish shape Would soone grow loath some, euen to blushes sence,

Surfet would cloake intemperare appetite,
Make the soule sent the rotten breath of lust.
When in an Italian lasciuious Pallace, a Lady gardianlesse.
Left to the push of all allurement,
The strongest incitements to immodestie,
To haue her bound, incensed with wanton sweetes,
Her vaines fild hie with heating delicates,

Soft rest, sweete Musick, amorous Masquerers, lasciuious banquets, sinne it selfe gilt ore, strong phantasie tricking vp strange delights, presenting it dressed pleasingly to sence, sence leading it vnto the soule, confirmed with potent ex|ample, impudent custome intic'd by that great bawd op|portunitie, thus being prepar'd, clap to her easie eare, youth in good clothes, well shapt, rich, faire spoken, promi|sing noble, ardent bloud-full, wittie, flattering, Vlisses absent, O Ith can chastest Penelope hold out.


Bil.
Masse ile thinke on't farewell.

Exit Bilioso.

Mal.

Farewell, take thy wife with the, farewell,
To Florence, um? it may prooue good, it may,
And we may once vnmaske our browes.




SCENA TERTIA.
Enter Count Celzo.

Cel.
My honour'd Lord.


Mal.
Celso peace, how ist? speake loe, pale feares suspect that hedges, walls  trees haue eares, speake how runs all?


Cel.

I faith my Lord, that beast with many heads,
The staggering multitude recoiles apace,
Though thorow great mens enuie, most mens mallice,
Their much intemperate heate hath banisht you.
Yet now they faind enuie and mallice neere,
Produce faint reformation.
The Duke, the too soft Duke lies as a block,
For which two tugging factions seeme to sawe,
But still the Yron through the ribbes they drawe.



Mal.

I tell thee Celzo, I haue euer found
Thy brest most farre from shifting cowardize
And fearfull basenesse: therfore ile tell thee Celzo,
I finde the winde begins to come abou,
Ile shift my sute of fortune, I know the Florentine whose on|ly force,
By marying his prowd daughter to this Prince,
Both banisht me, and made this weake Lord Duke,
Will now forsake them all, besure he will:
Ile lye in ambush for conueniencie,
Vpon their seuerance to confirme my selfe.



Cel.
Is Ferneze interred?


Mal.
Of that at leisure: he liues.


Cel.
But how stands Mendoza, how ist with him?


Mal.
Faith like a paire of Snuffers, sibbes filth in other men, and retaines it in himselfe.


Cel.
He do's flie fro~ publique notice me thinks, as a Haire do's from hounds, the feet wheron he flies betraies him.


Mal.

I can track him Celzo:
O my disguise fooles him most powerfully:
For that I seeme a desperate malecontent
He faine would claspe with me: he is the true slaue,
That will put on the most affected grace, Enter Mendoz.
For some vild second cause.



Cel.
Hees here.


Mal.
Giue place.
Illo, ho ho ho, art there old true peny,
Exit Celso.
Where hast thou spent thy selfe this morning? I see flattery in thine eyes,  damnation i'thy soule. Ha ye huge Rascal.


Men.
Thou art very merry.


Mal.
As a scholler futuens gratis: How doz the deuill go with thee now.


Men.
Maleuole, thou art an arrant knaue.


Mal.
Who I? I haue beene a Sergeant man.


Men.
Thou art very poore.


Mal.
As Iob, an Alcumist, or a Poet.


Men.
The Duke hates thee.


Mal.
As Irishmen do bum-cracks.


Men.
Thou hast lost his amitie.


Mal.
As pleasing as Maids loose their virginitie.


Men.
Would thou wert of a lustie spirit, would thou wert noble.


Mal.
Why sure my bloud giues me I am noble, sure I am of noble kinde, for I finde my selfe possessed with all their qualities: loue Dogs, Dice and Drabs scorne witte in stuffe clothes, haue beate my Shoomaker, knockt my Sempstres, cuckold my Pottecary, and vndone my Taylor.
Noble, why not? since the Stoick said; Neminem serm non

ex regibus, neminem regem non ex seruis esse oriundum, only bu|sie fortune towses, and the prouident chaunces blends them together; Ile giue you a symilie: did you ere see a Well with 2. buckets, whilst one comes vp full to be emptied, another goes downe emptie to be filled; such is the state of all hu|manitie: why looke you, I may be the sonne of some Duke, for beleeue me intemperate lasciuious bastardie makes no|bility doubtfull, I haue a lusty daring hart Mendoza.


Men.
Lets graspe? I doe like thee infinitely, wilt inact one thing for me?


Mal.
Shall I get by it?
Giues him his purse.
Commaund me, I am thy slaue, beyond death and hell.


Men.
Murther the Duke?


Mal.
My harts wish, my soules desire, my fantasies dream, My blouds longing, the only haight of my hopes, how? O God how? O how my vnited spirits throng together, So strengthen my resolue.


Men.
The Duke is now a hunting.


Mal.
Excellent, admirable, as the diuell would haue it, lend me, lend me, Rapier Pistol, Crosebow: so, so, ile do it.


Men.
Then we agree.


Mal.
As Lent and Fishmongers, come a cape ape, how in forme?


Men.
Know that this weake braind duke, who only stands on Florence stilts, hath out of witlesse zeale made me his heire, and secretly confirmed the wreathe to me after his lifes full point.


Mal.
Vpon what merit?


Men.
Merit? by heauen I horne him, onely Fernezies death gaue me states life: tut we are politique, he must not liue now.


Mal.
No reason marry: but how must he dye now.


Men.
My vtmost proiect is to murder the Duke, that I might haue his state, because he makes me his heire: to ba|nish the Duches, that I might be rid of a cu~ning Lacedemo|nian, because I know Florence will forsake her,  then to ma|rie Maria the banished duke Altofronts wife, that her friends might strengthen me and my faction, this is all lawe.



Mal.
Doe you loue Maria.


Mend.
Faith noe great affection, but as wise men do loue great wemen to inoble their bloud and augment their re|uenew: to accomplish this now, thus now. The Duke is in the forest next the Sea, single him kill him, hurle him i'the maine, and proclaime thou sawst Woolues eate him.


Mal.
Vm, not so good, me thinkes when he is slayne to get some Ipocrite, some daungerous wretch thats muffled, or with fayned holines to sweare he hard the Duke on some steepe cliffe lament his wifes dishonor, and in an agony of his hearts torture hurled his groning sides into the swolne sea, this circumstance well made, soundes probable, and hereupon the Dutches.


Men.
May well be banished:  vnpeerable inuension, rare, Thou God of pollicie! it hunnies me.


Mal.
Then feare not for the wife of Altofront, ile close to her.


Men.
Thou shalt, thou shalt, our excellencie is pleased: why wert not thou an Emperour, when wee are Duke ile make thee some great man sure?


Mal.
Nay make me some ritch knaue, and Ile make my selfe some great man.


Mend.
In thee be all my spirit, retaine ten soules, vnite thy vertuall powers, resolue, ha, remember greatnesse, hart farewell.
Enter Celso.
The fate of all my hopes in thee doth dwell.


Mal.

Celzo didst heare?  heauen didst heare?
Such diuelish mischiefe, sufferest thou the world
Carowse damnation euen with greedie swallow,
And still doost winke, still duz thy vengeance slumber,
If now thy browes are cleare; when will they thunder.


Exit.


SCENA QVARTA.
Enter Pietro, Ferrard, Prespasso and three Pages.

Ferr.
The Dogges are at a fault.

Cornets like hornes.

Piet.
Would God nothing but the dogs were at it? let the Deare persue safely, the Dogs follow the game, and do

you follow the dogges, as for me, tis vnfit one beast should hunt another; I ha one chaseth me: and please you I would be rid of yee a little.


Ferr.
Would your griefe would as soone as wee, leaue you to quietnesse.

Exeunt.

Piet.
I thanke you: Boy; what dost thou dreame of now?


Page.
Of a drie summer my Lord for heer's a he world towards: but my Lord I had a strange dreame last ight.


Piet.
What strange dreame?


Page.
Why me thought I pleased you with singing, and then I dreamt you gaue me that short sword.


Piet.
Prettily begd: hold thee, ile prooue thy dreame true, tak't.


Page.
My dutie: But stiil I dreamt on my Lord, and me thought and shall please your excellencie, you would needs out of your royall bountie giue me that iewell in your Hat.


Piet.
O thou didst but dreame boye, doe not beleeue it, dreames prooue not alwayes true, they may hold in a shorte sworde, but not in a Iewell. But now sir you dream you had pleasd me with singing, make that true as I ha made the other.


Page.
Faith my Lorde I did but dreame, and dreames you say prooue not alwayes true: they may hold in a good sworde, but not in a good song: the truth is, I ha lost my voyce.


Piet.
Lost thy voyce, how?


Page.
With dreaming faith but here's a couple of Syre|nicall rascal shall inchaunt yee: What shall they singe my good Lorde?


Piet
Sing of the nature of women, and then the song shall be suely full of varietie, olde crochets and most sweet closes; it shall be humerous, graue, fantastick, amorous, me|lancholy, sprightly, one in all, and all in one.


Pags.
All in on?


Piet.

I am feed to murther thee, start not; Mendozo, Mendozo hired me, hr's his gold, his Pistoll, Crosbowe, Sword, tis all as firme as earth: O foole, foole, choakt with the common maze of easie Ideots, credulity make him thine heire, what thy sworne murderer?


Pietro.
O can it be?


Mal.
Can?


Pietro.
Discouered he not Ferneze?


Mal.
Yes, but why? but why? for loue to thee, much, much, to be reueng'd vpon his riuall, who had thrust his iawes awrye, who being slaine supposed by thine owne hands; defended by his sword, made thee most loathsome, him most gratious, with thy loose Princes, thou closely yeelding egresse and regresse to hir, madest him heire, whose hot vnquiet lust straight towzd thy sheetes, and now would seaze thy state, polititian, wise man, death to be led to the stake, like a Bull by the hornes to make euen kindnes cut a gentle throate, life, why art thou numb'd: Thou fog|gie dulnesse speake? liues not more faith in a home thrust|ing tongue, then in these fencing tip tap Courtiers.

Enter Celso with a Hermits gowne and beard.

Mal.
If? come shade thee with this disguise, if? thou shalt handle it, he shall thanke thee for killing thy selfe, come follow my directions, and thou shalt see strange sleights.

Nay, and yee be in the teens, are yee a gentleman borne, do you know me, my name is Medam Maquerelle, I lye in the old Cunny Court.
Enter Beancha and Emilia.
See heere the Ladyes.


Bean.
A faire day to yee Maquerelle.


Emili.
Is the Dutches vp yet Centinell?


Maq.
O Ladies, the most abhominable mischance, O deare Ladies the most piteous disaster, Farneze was taken last night in the Dutches Chamber: Alas the Duke catcht him and kild him.


Bean.
Was he found in bed?


Maq.
O no, but the villanous certenty is, the dore was not bolted, the tongue-tyed hatch held his peace, so the naked troth is, he was found in his shirt, whilest I like an arrand beast lay in the outward Chamber, heard nothing, and yet they came by me in the dark, and yet I felt the~ not, like a sencelesse creature as I was. O beauties, looke to your buske-poynts, if not chastely, yet charily: be sure the doore be boulted: is your Lorde gone to Florence?


Bean.
Yes Maquarelle.


Maq.
I hope youle finde the discretion to purchase a fresh gowne fore his returne: Now by my troth beauties,

I would ha ye once wise: he loues ye, pish: he is witty, bub|ble: faire proportioned, mew: nobly borne, winde; let this be still your fixt position, esteeme me euery man according to his good gifts, and so yee shall euer remaine most deare, and most woorthie to be most deare Ladies.


Emilia.
Is the Duke returnd from hunting yet?


Maq.
They say, not yet.


Bean.
Tis now in mid'st of day.


Em.
How beares the Dutches with this blemish now?


Maq.
Faith boldly, strongly defyes defame, as one that haz a Duke to her father. And theres a note to you, be sure of a stout friend in a corner, that may alwayes awe your husband. Marke the hauiour of the Dutches now, she dares defame, cryes, Duke do what thou canst, ile quite mine honor: nay, as one confirmed in her owne vertue a|gainst ten thousand mouthes that mutter her disgrace, shees presently for daunces.

Enter Ferrar.

Bean.
For daunces?


Maq.
Most true.


Enusia.
Most strange, see, heeres my seruant yong Fer|rard: How many seruants thinkst thou I haue, Maqua|relle?


Maq.
The more the merier: twas well sayd, vse your seruants as you doe your smocks, haue many, vse one, and change often, for that's most sweete and courtlike.


Ferrar.
Saue ye fayre Ladies, is the Duke returned?


Bean.
Sweet Sir, no voyce of him as yet in Court.


Fer.
Tis very strange.


Bean.
And how like you my seruant, Maquarelle?


Maq.
I thinke hee could hardly drawe Ulisses bowe, but by my fidelity, were his nose narrower, his eyes broa|der, his hands thinner, his lippes thicker, his legges big|ger, his feete lesser, his haire blacker, and his teeth whiter, hee were a tollerable sweete youth ifaith. And hee will come to my Chamber, I will reade him the fortune of his beard.

Cornets sound.


Fer.

Not yet returnd I feare, but
The Dutches approcheth.


Enter Mendozo supporting the Dutches: Guerrino, the Ladyes that are on the Stage rise: Ferrard Vshers in the Dutches, and then takes a Lady to treade a measure.

Guerrino
Why tis but two singles on the left, two on the right, three double forward, a trauerse of six round: do this twice, three singles side, galliard tricke of twenty, curranto pace; a figure of eight, three singles broken downe, come vp, meete two doubles, fall backe, and then honor.

Enter a Page.

Celso
Boy, thy Maister, where's the Duke?


Page
Alas, I left him burying the earth with his spread ioylesse limbs: he tolde me he was heauy, would sleep, bade

me walke off, for that the strength of fantasie oft made him talking in his dreames: I strait obeide, nor neuer saw him since: but, where so ere he is, hee's sad.


Aur.

Rest in peace, as the Duke duz, quietly sit: for my owne part, I beheld him but dead, thats all: marry heers one can giue you a more particular account of him.


Men.
Speake holy father, nor let any browe within this presence fright thee from the truth: speake confidently and freely.


Aur.
We attend.


Pietro

Now had the mounting Suns all-ripening wings
Swept the cold sweat of night from earths danke breast,
When I (whom men call Hermit of the Rocke)
Forsooke my Ceil, and clamberd vp a cliffe,
Against whose base, the heady Neptune dasht
His high curld browes, there t'was I easde my limbes,
When loe, my entrailes melted with the moane,
Some one, who farre boue me was climbde, did make:
I shal offend.



Men.
Not.


Aur.
On.


Pietro.

Me thinks I heare him yet, O female faith!
Coe sowe the ingratefull sand, and loue a woman:
And do I liue to be the skoffe of men,
To be their wittall cuckold, euen to hugge my poyson?
Thou knowest  Trueth!
Sooner hard steele will melt with Southerne wind;
A Seamans whistle calme the Ocean;
A towne on fire be extinct with teares,
Then women vow'd to blushlesse impudence,
With sweet behauiour and soft minioning,
Will turne from that where appetite is fixt.
O powerfull blood! how thou dost slaue their soule?
I washt an Ethiop, who for recompence
Sullyde my name. And must I then be for'cd.
To walke, to liue thus black: must, must, fie,
He that can beare with must, he cannot die.
With that he sigh'd so passionately deepe,
That the dull ayre even groand, at last he cries:
Sinke shame in seas, sinke deepe enough, so dies.
For then I viewd his bodie fall and sowse
Into the fomy maine, O then I saw
That which me thinks I see, it was the Duke,
Whome straight the nicer stomackt sea
Belcht vp: but then,



Mal.

Then came I in, but las all was too late,
For euen straight he sunke.



Pietro.
Such was the Dukes sad fate.


Cel.
A better fortune to our Duke Mendozo.
Cry all, Mendozo: Cornets florish.

Enter a guard.

Men.

A guard, a guard, we full of hartie teares,
For our good fathers losse,
For so we well may call him:
Who did beseech your loues, for our succession,
Cannot so lightly ouer-iumpe his death.
As leaue his woes reuenglesse: To Emilia, woman of shame,
We banish thee for euer to the place,
From whence this good man comes,
Nor permit on death vnto the bodie any ornament:
But base as was thy life, depart away.




Aur.
Vngratefull.


Men.
Away.


Aur.
Villaine heare me.

Prepasso and Guerino leads away the Dutches.

Men.

Be gone my Lords, addresse to publique counsel,
Tis most fit,
The traine of Fortune is borne vp by wit.
Away, our presence shal be sudden, haste.


All depart sauing Mendozo, Maleuole, and Pietro.

Mal.
Now you egregious deuill, ha ye murthering po|lititian, how dost duke? how dost looke now? braue duke yfaith.


Men:
How did you kill him?


Mal:
Slatted his brains out, then sowst him in the bri|nie sea.


Men:
Braind him and drownd him too?


Mal:
O twas best, sure worke:
For he that strikes a great man, let him strike home, or els ware, heele prooue no man: shoulder not a huge fellow, vnlesse you may be sure to lay him in the kennell.


Men:

A most sound braine panne,
Ile make you both Emperours



Mal:
Make vs christians, make vs christians.


Men:
Ile hoist yee, yee shall mount.


Mal.
To the gallows, say ye? O  me, Praium incer|tum petit certum scelus. How stands the Progresse?


Men.

Here, take my ring vnto the Citadell,
Haue entrance to Maria the graue Dutches
Of banisht Altofront. Tell her wee loue her:
Omit no circumstance to grace our Person (doo't)



Mal.
Iste make an excellent pandar: Duke farewell, due adue Duke.

Exit

Men.

Take Maquerelle with thee; for t'is found,
None cutts a Diamon but a Diamound.
Hermit, thou art a man for me, my Confessor,
O thou selected spirit, borne for my good,
Sure thou wouldst make an excellent elder in a deformed

church:
Come, we must be inward, thou and I all one.



Pietro
I am glad I was ordayned for yee.


Men.
Goe to then, thou must knowe that Malenole is a strange villaine: dangerous, very dangerous, you see howe broade a speakes, a grose-jawde rogue, I would haue thee poison him: hees like a korne vpon my great oe, I cannot goe for him: hee must be kored out: he must, wilt doo't, h?


Pietro
Anything, any thing.


Men.

Heart of my life, thus then to the Citadell,
Thou shalt consort with this Maleuole,
There being at supper, poison him,
It shalbe layde vpon Maria, who yeeldes loue, or dies,
Skud quicke.



Pietro
Like lightning good deedes crawle, but mischiefe flies.

Enter Maleuole. Exit Pietro

Mal.
Your diuelships ring haze no vertue, the buffe|captaine, the sallo-westfalian gamon-faced zaza cries stand out, must haue a stiffer wareant, or no passe into the castle of Comfort.


Men.
Commaund our sodaine Letter: not enter? sha, what place is there in Genoa, but thou shalt into my heart, into my very heart: come, lets loue, we must loue, we two, soule and body.


Mal.
How didst like the Hermite? A strange Her|mite sirrah.


Men.
A dangerous fellow, very perillous: he must die.


Mal.
I, he must die.


Men.
Thoust kil him: we are wise, we must be wise.


Mal.
And prouident.


Men.
Yea prouident; beware an hypocrite.

A Church man once corrupted, oh auoyd
A fellow that makes Religion his stawking horse,
He breedes a plague: thou shalt poyson him.



Mal.
Ho, tis wondrous necessary: how?



Men.

You both goe ioyntly to the Citadell,
There sup, there poison him: and Maria,
Because she is our opposite, shall beare
The sad suspect, on which she dies, or loues vs.



Mal:
I runne.

Exit mal:

Men:

We that are great, our sole self good still moues vs:
They shall die both, for their deserts craues more
Than we can recompence, their presence still
Imbraides our fortunes with beholdingnesse,
Which we abhorre, like deede, not door: then conclude,
They liue not to cry out Ingratitude.
One sticke burnes tother, steele cuts steele alone:
Tis good trust few: but O, tis best trust none.


Exit Mendozo.


SCENA QVARTA.
Enter Maleuole and Pietro still disguised, at seuerall doores.

Mal:
How doe you? how doost Duke?


Pietro

O let the last day fall, drop, drop in our curssed heads!
Let heauen vnclasp itselfe, vomit forth flames:



Mal:
O doe not raue, do not turne Player, theres more of them, than can well live one by an other already. What, art an Infidell still?


Pietro
I am mazde, strucke in a swowne with wonder, I am commaunded to poison thee.


Mal:
I am commaunded to poyson thee, at supper.


Pietro
At supper?


Mal:
In the Citadell.


Pietro
In the Citadell.


Mal:
Crosse capers, trickes? truth a heauen would dis|charge vs as boyes do elder gunnes, one pellet to strike out another: of what faith art now?


Pietro
Al is damnation, wickednes extreame, there is no faith in man.


Men.
In none but vsurers and brokers, they deceiue no man, men take vm for blood-suckers, and so they are: now God deliuer me from my friendes.



Pietro
Thy friendes?


Mal.
Yes, from my friends, for from mine ennemies Ile deliuer my selfe. O, cut-thrate friendship is the ranc|kest villany, marke this Mendozo, marke him for a villaine: but heauen will send a plague vpon him for a rogue.


Pietro
O world!


Mal.
World? Tis the onely region of Death, the grea|test shop of the Diuell, the cruelst prison of men, out of the which none passe without paying their dearest breath for a fee, theres nothing perfect in it, but extreame extreame ca|lamitie, such as comes yonder.



SCENA QVINTA.
Enter Aurelia, two Holberts before, and two after, supported by Celso and Ferrard, Aurelia in base mourning attire.

Aur.
To banishment, led on to banishment


Pietro
Lady, the blessednesse of repentance to you.


Au.
Why, why, I can desire nothing but death, nor de|serue any thing but hell.

If heauen should giue sufficiencie of grace
To deere my soule, it would make heauen gracelesse:
My sinnes would make the stocke of mercy poore,
Oh they would try heauens goodnes to eclaime them:
Iudgement is iust yet from that vast villaine:
But sure he shall not misse sad punishment,
For he shall rule on to my Cell of shame.



Pietro

My Cell tis Lady, where insteede of Maskes,
Musique, Tilts, Tournies, and such Courtlike shewes,
The hollow murmure of the checklesse windes
Shall groane againe, whilst the vnquiet sea
Shakes the whole rocke with foamy battery:
There Vsherlesse the ayre comes in and out,
The reumy vault will force your eyes to weepe,
Whilst you behold true desolation:
A rocky barrennesse shall paine your eyes,
Where all at once one reaches, where he stands,
With browes the roofe, both walles with both his handes.



Aur.

It is to good, blessed spirit of my Lord:
O in what or befoere thy soule is throand,
Behold me worthily most miserable:
O let the anguish of my contrite spirite,
Intreate some reconciliation:
If not, O ioy! triumph in my iust griefe,
Death is the end of woes, and teares reliefe.



Pietro
Belike your Lord not lou'd you, was vnkinde.


Aur.

O heauen,
As the soule lou'd the body, so lou'd hee,
Twas death to him to part my presence,
Heauen to see me pleased:
Yet I like to a wretch given ore to hell,
Brake all the sacred rites of marriage,
To clippe a base vngentle faithles villaine:
O God, a very Pagan reprobate!
What should I say, vngratefull throwes me out,
For whom I lost soule, body, fame, and honor:
But tis most fit: why should a better fate
Attend on any, who forsake chaste sheetes,
Flie the imbrace of a deuoted hart,
Ioynd by a solemne vow sore God and man,
To taste the brackish bloud of beastly lust
In an adulterous touch? Oh rauenous immodesty,
Insatiate impudence of appetite:
Looke, heere' your end, for marke what sap in dust,
What sinne in good, euen so much loue in lust:
Ioy to thy ghost, sweete Lord, pardon to me.



Cel.
It is the Dukes pleasure this night you rest in court.


Aur.

Soule lurke in shades, run shame from brightsome skies,
In night, the blind man misseth not his eies.


exit Au:

Mal.
Do not weep kind cuckold, take comfort man, thy betters haue beene Beccos: Agamemnon Emperour of all the merry Greekes; that tickled all the true Troyans, was a

Cornuto: Prince Arthur that cut off twelue Kings beardes was a Cornuto: Hercules, whose backe, bore vp heauen, and got forty wenches with childe in one night.


Pietro
Nay twas fifty.


Mal:
Faith fortie's enow a conscience, yet was a Cor|nuto: patience, mischiefe growes prowde, be wise.


Piet:
Thou pinchest too deepe, art too keene vpon me.


Mal:
Tut, a pittifull surgeon makes a dangerous sore. Ile tent thee to the ground. Thinkst Ile sustaine my selfe by ttering thee, because thou art a Prince? I had rather follow a drunkard, and liue by licking vp his vomite, than by seruile flattery.


Piet:
Yet great men ha don't.


Mal:
Great slaues feare better than loue, borne natu|rally for a coale-basket, though the common ysher of prin|ces presence fortune ha blindely giuen them better place, I am vow'd to be thy affliction.


Pietro
Prethee be, I loue much misery, and be thou sonne to me.

Enter Biliosa.

Mal:

Because you are an vsurping Duke,
Your Lordship's well returnd for Florence.'To Biliosa.



Bil:
Well returnd, I praise my horse.


Mal:
What newes from the Florentines?


Bil:
I will conceale the great Dukes pleasure, onely this was his charge, his pleasure is, that his daughter die, Duke Pietro be banished for banishing his bloudes dishonor, and that Duke Altofront be reaccepted: this is all, but I heare Duke Pietro is dead.


Mal.
I, and Mendozo is Duke, what will you doe?


Bil:
Is Mendozo strongest?


Mal:
Yet he is.


Bil:
Then yet Ile hold with him.


Mal:
But if that Altofront should turne strait againe?


Biliosa.

Why then I would turne strait againe:
Tis good runne still with him that haz most might:
I had rather stand with wrong, then fall with right



Mal.
Your Lordship sweats, your yong Ladie will get you a cloth for your old worships browes,
Exit Biliosa.
heeres a fellow to be damnd, this is his muiolable Maxim. (flatter the greatest, and oppresse the least:) a whorson flesh fly, that still gnawes vpon the leane gauld backs.


Piet.
Why dust then salute him?


Mal.
Faith as bades go to Church, for fashion sake: come, be not confounded, th'art but in danger to  a Dukedome, think this: this earth is the only graue a ol|gotha wherein all thinges that liue must rotte: tis but the draught wherein the heauenly bodies discharge their cor|ruption, the verie muckhill on which the sublunarie orbes cast their excrements: man is the slime of this dongue-pit, and Princes are the gouernours of these men: for, for our soules, they are as free as Emperoures, all of one peece, there goes but a paire of sheeres betwixt an Emperour and the sonne of a bagpiper: only the dying, dressing, pressing, glos|sing makes the difference: now what art thou like to lose?

A iaylors office to keepe men in bonds,
Whilst toyle and treason, all lifes good confounds.



Pietro.

I heere renounce for euer Regencie,
O Altofront, I wrong thee to supplant thy right:
To trip thy heeles vp with a diuelish slight.
For which I now from Throane am throwne, world tricks abiure,
For vengance that comes sow, yet it comes sure.
O I am chang'd, for heerefore the dread power
In true contrition I doe dedicate,
My breath to solitarie holines,
My lips to prayer, and my brests are shall be,
Restoring Altofront to regency.



Mal.
Thy vowes are heard, and we accept thy faith.
Enter Ferneze d Celso vndisgiseth himselfe.
Altofront, Ferneze, Celso, Pietr.
Banish amazement: come, we foure must stand full shocke of Fortune, be not so wnder st.



Pietro
Doth Ferneze liue?


.
For your pardon.


Ptro

Pardon and loue, giue leaue to recollect
My thoughts disperst in wilde astonishment:
My vowes stand fixt in heauen, and from hence
I craue all loue and pardon.



Mal.

Who doubts of prouidence,
T  this change, a hartie faith to all:
H  ust rise, who can no lower fall,
 petuous Vicissitude
Looseth the world, then let no maze intrude
Vpon your spirits: wonder not I rise,
For who can sinke that close can temporise?
The time growes ripe for action, Ile detect
My priuatst plot, est ignorance feare suspect:
Lets cloase to counsell, leaue the rest to fate,
Mature discretion is the life of state.

O thou art a blessed creature, had I a modest wo|man to conceale, I would put her to thy custodie, for no reasonable creature would euer suspect her to be in thy company: ha, thou art a melodious Maquarelle, thou picture of a woman and substance of a beast, and how dost thou think a this transformation of state now?


Maq.
Verie verie well, for we women alwaies note, the falling of the one, is the rising of the other: some must be fat, some must be leane, some must be fooles, and some must be Lords: some must be knaues, and some must bee

officers, some must be beggars, some must be Kni some must be cuck olds, and some must be citizens: as for example, I haue two court dogs, most fawning curres he one calde Watch, thother Cah: now I, like Ladie Fortune, somtimes loue this dog somtimes rouse that dog, somtimes fauour Watch, most commonly fancie Catch: Now that dogge which I fauour I feede and hes so rauenous, that what I giue he neuer chawes it, gulpes it dow  without any relish of what he haz, but with a  |pectation of what he shal haue: the other dogge 


Mal.
No more dogge, soote Maquarelle no more dog and what hope hast thou of the Dutches Maria, will she stoope to the Dukes luer, wil she come, thinkst?


Maq.
Let me see wheres he signe now? ha ye ee a cal|lender, wheres the signe tro you?


Mal.
Sign? why, is there any moment in that?

O beleeue me a most secret power, looke yee a Caldean, or an Assyrian, I am sure t'was a most sweete Iew ould me, court any woman in the right signe, you shal not misse, but you must take he in the right veine then: As when the signe is in Pisces, a fishmogers wife is verie so|tiable: in Cancer, a prcisians wife is verie flexible: in Ca|pricorne, a Marchants wife hardly holdes out: in Libra, a Lawyers wife is very tractable, especially, if her husband be at the tearme: onely, in Scorpio s veie dangerous medling, haz the Duke sent any jewell, anie rich stones?

Maq.
Twill goe hard, she was a could creature euer, she hated munkies, fooles, ieasters, and gentlemen vshers extreamely: she had the vilde tricke on't, not onely to bee truely modestly honourable in her owne consci|enc  shee would avoide the least wanton carri|a  might incurre suspect, as God blesse me, she   brought bed pressing out of fashion: I could arce get a fine, for the lease of a Ladies fauour once in a fortnight.

Nay, by mine honour madam, as good hee nere a husband, as a banisht husband, hees in an other world now, Ile tell y Lady, I haue heard of a sect that maintained, when the husband was asleepe, the wife might lawfully entertaine another man: for then her husband was as dead, much more when he is banished.


Mar.
Vnhonest creature:


Maq.
Pish, honesty is but an art to seeme so: pray yee whats honesty? whats constancie? but fables fained, odde old fools chat deuisde by ielous fooles, to wrong our liberty.


Mal.

despight of Rosciclere, or Donzell dell Phebe theres wels, if thou wilt, so, if not, so.


Mar:

Captaine, for Gods loue saue poore wretchednesse,
From tyranny of lustfull insolence:
Inforce me in the deepest dungeon dwell
Rather then heere, heere round about is hell.
O my dear'st Altofront where ere thou breath,
Let my soule sinke into the shades beneath:
Before I staine thine honour, tis thou hast,
And long as I can die I will liue chaste.



Mal.
Gainst him that can enforce how vaine is strife?

She that can be enforc'd haz nere a knife.
She that through force her limbes with lust enroules,
Wants Cleopatraes aspes and Portiaes coales.
God amend you.

Men.

And Celso,  let it be thy care to night
To haue some pretty shew o solemnize
Our high instalment, some musike, maskery:
Weele giue fre enttaine vnto Maria
The Dutchesse to the banishd Altofront:
Thou shalt conduct her from the Citadell
Vnto the Pallace, thinke on some maskery.



Cel:
Of what shape, sweete Lorde,


Men.

Why shape? why any quicke done fiction,
As some brau spirites of the Gen Dukes,
To come out of Elizium forsooth,
Led in by Mercury to gratulate

Our happy fortune, some such any thing, some farre et tricke, good for Ladies, some stale toy or other, no matter so't be of our deuising.

Do thou prepar't, tis but for fashion sake,
Feare not, it shal be grac'd man, it shall take.

Men:

All thankes, our hand shal not be lose to thee: farewel
Now is my trechery secure, nor can we fall:
Mischiefe that prspers men do vertue call,
Ile trust no man, he that by trickesgos wreathes,
Keepes them with le, no man seely breathes,
Out of  rankes the Crowde will mtter foole:
Who cannot beare with spie he cannot rule:
The chist  for a man of flat,
Is to liue senslesse of a strengthlesse hate.

Pre.
And theres a great fellow playes the knaue, why dost not strike him?


Bil:
Let him play the knaue a Gods name, thinkst thou I haue no more wit then to strike a great fellow, the musike, more lights, reueling, scaffolds: do you heare? let there be othes enow ready at the doore, sweare out the diuel himself. Lets leaue the Ladies, and goe see if the Lords be ready for them.

All saue the Ladie depart.

Maq.
And by my troth Beauties, why do you not put you into the fashion, this is a stale cu you must come in fa|shion: looke ye, you must be all felt, fealt and feather, a fealt vpon your head: looke ye, these ing things are iustly out of request now: and doe yee heare? you must weare falling bands, you must come into the falling fashion: there is such a deale a pinning these ruffes, when the sine cleane fall is woorth all: and agen if you should chance to take a nap in the afternoone, your falling ba requires no poting sticke to recouer his forme: beheue , no fashion to the falling band I say.

Emil.
But, is not Marshall Make-roome my seruant in reversion, a proper gentleman?


Maq.
Yes in  as he had his office, as in truth he hath all things in reversion: hee haz his Mistris in reversi|on, his cloathes in reversion, his wit in reversion,  indeed, is a suter to me for my dogge in reversion: but in good ve|ritie la, hee is as proper a gentleman in reversion as: and indeede, as fine a man as may be, hauing a red beard and a paire of warpt legges,


Bean.
But I faith I am most monstrously in loue with count Quidlibet in Quodlibet, is he not a pretty dapper windle gallant?


Maq.
He is even one of the most busy ingerd lords, he will put the beauties to the squeake most hiddeously.

Men:
Thou obstinate, thou shalt die: captaine, that La|dies life is forfeited to Iustice, we haue examined her,

And we do finde, she hath impoisoned
The reerend Hermite, therefore we command
Serest custody. Nay, if youle dooes no good,
Youst dooes no harme, a tyrants peace is blood.

O thou art mercifull, O gratious diuell,
Rather by much let me condemned be,
For seeming murder than be amn'd for thee.

Die like a Bride, poore heart thou shalt die chaste. Enter Aurelia in morning habit.
