A distinct Declaration of the Requiring of the Lorde / which the Lorde the liuinge God of Heauen hath declared out of his holie Sion and heauenlie Ierusalem  and set-fourth through the Elder Fidelitas.
The First Chapiter.
_IN the Two-and-seuentith  Yeare of the Elderdom of HN (In y^ time when-as Certen beinge turned-in vnto themselues; tooke-on a Conceit or Mea|ninge, that they could vnpre|ared and vnregenerated  and with-out the Tes|amentes of God  and with-out the Ministra|ion of those-same through HN, be the People of God in whom Hee is wel-pleased / and vncircum|sed on the Foreskinne of their Heartes, enter into he Sanctuarie of God: and that then coulde euen|, in the Turning-in and Loue vnto themselues   the Disobedience vnto the Requiring of the gra|ous Woorde of the Lorde and his Seruice of oue  and in the Seperation from the Doctrine of N in the true Testamentes of God, liue vpright d free / and also followe-after and fulfill the Lord|s Will / which they distincted not from out of eir owne Will) hath the God of Heaue~ distinct|lie

declared vnto Mee Fidelitas, a Fellowe-elder in the Famelie of Loue with cleere Declaration, out Psal. 50. a. Esa. 2. a. Mich. 4. a. of his holie Sion and heauenlie Ierusalem; the right Requiring of his Woord and Will: and also the right Waye or Passe-ouer which leadeth to the vpright Life of the Righteous  to God-his true Sanctuarie  and to the right Esa. 32. c. Sap. 3. . Rest and Free|dom of the Children of God: and the Woorde of the Lorde came vnto Mee / and saide:
2. GO-fourth and shewe thyself among the Children of Men which trouble or busye them about my Trueth  and about my Woorde and Righteousnes / speciallie among them, that are turned-in vnto themselues and their owne Loue / and meane or suppose euenso, that they in the Loue of themselues  and in their taken-on Know|ledge of the godlie Thinges, haue my Trueth and Righteousnes: and saye vnto them to their Pre|seruation; all these Woordes which I speake vnto thee / Ier. 31. c. and geeue thee in thy Heart and Mouth / or write thesame in a Letter / and endeuour the diligentlie, that thesame be heald-fourth before thei Eyes  and hearde in their Eares. First or befor all; amonge those which reade and heare the godlie Testimonies of my gratious Woorde set-fourth by my chosen Minister HN; or which haue rea and hearde or allowed thosesame and yet not applyed them with all their Heart, to perfourme th Requiringe therof: and witnes and declare vnt them all which geeue-eare thervnto, That whic I require through my gratious Woorde: Ezech. 3. b. an warne them all of the Desiruction that shall fa vpon the wicked Worlde  vpon all Vnbeleeuers

Disobedientones / and Resisters of the Requi|ringe of my Woorde  and vpon all Offallers or Declyners from the Requiringe of thesame.
3. And in all thissame, infourme and instruct them likewise, what it is that letteth or hindereth them, that they vnderstand not rightlie the Re|quiringe of my gratious Woorde and Seruice of Loue / nor-yet are obedient from the Requiringe of the Math 3.  Luk. 3. b. Heb. 6. a. first Entraunce to the true christian Life, till vnto the Perfection therof; in anye right maner to thesame / nor bestowe their diligence aright ther vnto: and how that they for-that-cause, cannot perseuer firmlie therin  nor com to the true Heb. 3. b. 4. a. Free|dom of the Children of God. But call or bidde them first, to the Conuertion and Math. 18. a. Iohn. 3. a. Turninge|about to the right Childshipp of the new Birth / and that they let their Vnderstandinges be re|newed therto, vnder the Obedience of my Loue / and saye vnto them:
4. TVrne you about to the Math. 18. . Mark. 10. b. childish Single|mindednes, O yee Children of Men: Depart from the Heathenshipp of your Vncircum|cision / and com-in heather to the Couenaunt of the Lorde and his Circumcised: and humble you obe|dientlie, to the Requiringe of the seruiceable Out|flowinge of the gratious Woorde of the Lorde / shewing-fourth vpright Math. 3. a. Act. 2. c. 3. c. Frutes of Repentaunce. For That is the Requiringe of the Lorde: And ther-to to-weet, to the Entraunce of thatsame, wherof ther is spoken; let your Vnderstandinges becom renewed, vnder the Obedience of the Loue / and yourselues Act. 3 . brought-to-right againe: and euenso in your Conuertion, becom first in the right

Feare Pro. 1. a. 9. b. Eccli. 1. b. of God the true Forefrunt of y^e Entraunce to the Sanctuarie of God circumcised on the Foreskinne Deu. 10. b. Iere. 4. a. of your Heartes, to the Col. 2. b. 1. Pet. 2. a. Laying-a|way of the Sinne in the Fleash: and shewe-fourth goodwillinge Obedience therin.
5. For thatsame and to shewe-fourth Obedience therin, is the Lord-his right Couenaunt of Cir|cumcision / Rom. 2. c. Col. 2. b. which the right Seede of Abraham beareth in his Fleash / and that maketh the right Difference, betwixt the Lord-his People / and the vncircumcised Heathen: And it is the right Co|uenaunt of the Lorde / which the Lorde er-euer Hee maketh the Iere. 31. c. Heb. 8. b. 10. a new Couenaunt with his People; ordaineth Gen. 17. b. first by his People / and which also in the Ministration and Obedience of his Requy|ringe, hath the Fore-going by them, to the Esa. 52. a. Ezech. 44. a. Ioel. 3. b. En|traunce of the true Sanctuarie of God and of his vpright Godseruice / where no Vncircumcised may enter-in.
6. And when yee now to a right Entraunce of the true Sanctuarie of God; are entred into this Couenaunt of the Lorde / and of the Circumcising of his People / and that his Requiringe is accom|plished by you, with the People of the Lorde, the Communialtie or Famelie of the Loue / so enter than likewise into the Rom. 10. b. Beleef of Iesu Christ the true Holie of God-his Sanctuarie wherin the Ac|complishing Heb. 9. b. c. of the true Offeringe  Godseruice of the Circumcised of the Lorde  the right Baptisme ether Washinge of the Beleeuers, Ezech. 36. c. with the pure Water and pretious Bloud of Iesu Christ  and the true Forgeeuenes of Sinnes / Heb. 9. b. c. and the vpright Purginge or Safe-makinge from thesame, cometh|to-passe

or is wrought: and where-out the right Renewinge Rom. 12. a. Ephe. 4. b. of the Heart and Minde proceedeth.
7. And in thesame true Beleef and Baptisme of Iesu Christ, becom implanted into Christ, Rom. 6. . Phil. 3. a. with his like Death: and let yourselues euenso in the Death of Iesu Christ; be prepared to an vpright People of the Lorde / Deut. 4. a. d 10. b. Ephe. 1. a. in whom Hee hath a good|pleasure / and that are meete to enter into his Rest  and to the Rest and Freedom of the Children of God. And in thesame true Beleef or Holie / and in the Requiringe of thesame and his Ministration, shew-fourth Deu. 6. 30. a. goodwillinge Obedience / and Mat. 10. 24. b bide stedfast therin, vntill that it all which the Lorde re|quireth of you and in you, be fulfilled / and that Christ Rom. 8. a. Gal. 2. c. 4. b. after the Spirit  and the true Apo. 21. c. Kingdom of Heauens and his vpright Righteousnes, be com vnto you.
8. For euenso in the Fulfillinge or Perfour|maunce  of the Requiringe of the Seruice of the true Beleef  and in the Cominge of Christ with the Apo. 21. a. Kingdom of Heauens and his spirituall and heauenlie Goods, the Lorde Ier. 31. d. Heb. 8. a. 10. a erecteth with his People, his new Couenaunt of Perfection / wher|in it becometh then all fulfilled and accomplished, that is writen in the Luk. 24. g. Lawe of Moyses. that God hath required through his Propheates. and that is euangelized of Christ and of his Kingdom.
9. And thatsame new Couenaunt, is the true new Couenaunt which the Lorde hath promised, to mate or erect with his People: and which also in the Fulfilling of his former Couenaunt, Hee ma|keth or erecteth with his People / and remembreth not Ier. 31. d. Heb. 8. 10. a. their Sinnes anymore. For euenso, in their

Purginge or Safe-makinge through Iesus Christ in the Beleef  and in the Accomplishinge of the|same Seruice in the Holie, becometh Math. 27. d. 2. Cor. 3. b. the Vayle which is the Heb. 10. b. Fleash of Christ; don-away from the Mostholie of the true Sanctuarie of God / and the Lorde vncouereth then by his People, his most|holie Sanctuarie Apo. 21. a. full of all sumpteous Garnish|inge of pure Bewtie / and full of all spirituall and heauenlie Goods and Riches of God and Christ: and they becom euenso glorified, from the 2. Cor. 3. b. vnco|uered Face of God and Christ, with the true Bee|inge of the vpright Perfection. serued with the spirituall Heb. 8. a. and heauenlie Goods. and repleanished with the holie Iohn. 14. b. Act. 2. a. Spirit of the Loue of God and Christ.
10. And euenso in the Fulfillinge of thesame, They are Rom. 8. b. the true Children of the new Testa|ment in Iesu Christ, and the vpright Elders and Fathers in the Famelie of the Loue of Iesu Christ, which geeue or set not fourth their Testimonies, out of the Knowledge of many godlie Thinges: but which bring-fourth, out of the Accomplishinge of the fore-goinge Seruice  and out of the spirituall and heauenlie Treasure of the godlie Beeing of their Heart, Math. 13. f. the Newe and the Olde / that is, the True and the Figuratiue.
11. And all they that are in such-sort, out of the Accomplishinge of the fore-goinge Seruice, entred into Ier. 31. d. the true Sanctuarie of God and Christ, Those knowe and perceaue that the Lorde is euen|so the true Lorde, Deut. 4. a. amonge his People: and they haue then obtayned the vpright Ephe. 4. b. Knowledge of the perfect Righteousnes and Godlines  the vp|right

Esa. 32. . Iohn. 8. c. Freedom of the Children of God  and the true Appeasement of the Conscience, in Iesu Christ.
12. But to remaine in the Sinne vnrepentant   and without the Seruice of the Loue of Iesu Christ, vnregenerated (wherin yee seduce and destroye one-another of you O yee Children of Men; with the Knowledge) and that yee then euenso at the last when-as the Destruction hath bewrapped you; shall see and perceaue therin, that yee haue accounted yourselues wyse, before the time appoin|ted  taken-on the Sap. 2. . Freedom in your Vnregene|ration  and Pro. 1. c. refused the proffered Grace of the Lorde / and the Obedience of the Requiring of his gratious Woorde and Seruice of Loue: and that yee likewise in all your Fourth-goinge, haue not accordinge to the Requiringe of the vpright Righteousnes which God esteemeth; don ne brought-fourth any vpright Frutes of Repen|taunce / and must be fayne to beare the Rom. 2. . Iudgment of God, with the wicked Worlde  and with the euell Thinges, wherin shee and her Adherentes do liue: and that yee then knowe or perceaue therin, that the Lorde the true God of Loue is not any God of the Vnrepentant and of the Disobedient: but is their God, Iohn. 9. . Act. 10. f. which loue the Righteousnes and the Fulfillinge of the Requiringe of his Woorde / and hate all Vnrighteousnes and Re|sistaunce of the Requiringe of his Woorde / So shall then all thatsame in thesame Iudgment of God; be a great Sap. 5. a. Accusation vnto you of your Sinnes, to your Condemnation.
13. Therfore, be now warned heer-withall / and feare not ouer-much, to forgoe or leese your owne

Will and Corruption or Consumeablenes that hangeth so fast on / Math. 16. e. that yee forsake not ther|through the euer-lastinge vpright Righteousnes  and the Ministration to thesame appertayninge: But feare rather, for the Frindshippe of y^e Worlde / and for your owne Self-seekinges cause, to be|com the Iam. 4. a. Enemies of God  and Disobedient to the Requiringe of his Woorde / and so then to leese the Apo. 21. a. eternall Perfection of the pure Bewtie of the euer-lastinge Kingdom: and perpetuallie to misse or be depriued-of; the eternall immutable Riches of the spirituall and heauenlie Goods: and to byde seperated for-euer, 2. Tess. 1. a. from the louelie Be|holdinge of the vncouered Face of God and Christ, and from the perfect Esa. 35. 51. b Ioye of the eternall Life. Yea, therof be you all afraide.
14. BVt if now ther be not any Feare with  you touching this Matier / or that yee beleeue not the Woorde of the Lorde and his Re|quiringe heerin / nor haue any force therof, O yee Children of Men / and euenso meane ether coniec|ture out of your owne Wisedom, that yee being vnprepared  and without the Obedience of the Re|quiringe of the gratious Woorde of the Lorde  and without the Perfourmaunce of the Requiring of the forementioned Seruice in the Holie, can in|herit and bring-fourth the vpright Frutes of the godlie Life / Trulie, that Supposell of yours, will vtterlie disappoint you / and your owne Wis|dome will deceaue, seduce, and begile you all: and also estraunge you from the Ioye of the Childship of the holie Sion. from the Ephe. 2. b. Citizenship of the hea|uenlie Ierusalem. from the Inheritaunce of the

Testamentes of God and Israel. and from the Freedom of the Children of God: and yee shall euenso be forced, to remaine captiue in the Heathen|ship  and in the Abhomination of Desolatio~ of the Kingdom of Babel, and obtaine therin a terrible Ende.
15. THerfore heare the Woorde of the Lorde, to Obedience of his Requiringe / and let Pro. 2. 4. . thesame sincke into your Heartes / and turne not backe in any-case: nether suffer yourselues to be drawen-away from That which is set-fourth before you, out of the gratious Woorde of the Lorde and his Seruice of Loue / nor-yet lead ther|from, by any Mans Woordes that is against thesame. For if you haue bestowed your diligence to heare the Witnessinges of the gratious Woord of the Lorde, set-fourth through the holie Spirit of the Loue of Iesu Christ: and that yee haue yeal|ded your Voyce or consented therin, with our Fellowe-elder HN: and that yee haue moreouer; enterprised or begon your Fourth-goinge therin / So looke well then heerto, that yee seeke not to fi|nish thesame Beginninge, in the Witnessinges of Men that are against thesame / and in their Ma|lice and Offenciuenes, execute or iudge a false Iudgment ouer vs and our Ministration.
16. But fixe or bende alwayes all your Sight  and Consideration on Mee FAITHFVLNES / and consider, how that the Lorde hath chosen Mee euen from my very Psal. 71. . Ier. 1. a. Birth out of my Mothers Wombe; to the Obedience of the Requiringe of his Woorde / for that I with you / and yee also with mee according to the Requiringe of y^e Tes|timonics

of his gratious Woorde; should becom vnited therin / and so wee to growe of one vniforme|beeinge with each-other, in thesame / To thende that yee mought euenso according to the Requi|ringe of thesame; haue a right Course or Passaige for to com-in, Deut. 10. a. Math. 22. d. to the true Loue of your God  to the vpright Loue of your Neighbour  2. Pet. 1. b. to the vp|right Loue of brotherlie Familiaritie  and to the right common Loue towardes all Men: and then likewise mought Math. 10. c. 24. b. perseuer firmlie therin.
17. BVT alas; for that I FAITHFVLNES am so small / and that my faithfull Obe|dience, is euery-wheare; so little regarded among the Children of Men / So cannot therfore many of you, consider well on Mee nor on my Obe|dience / for to becom of one Heart and Minde ther|with.
18. Therfore heare now the Woorde of the Lorde, O yee Children of Men: Turne-away the Sight of your Eyes, Psal. 131. a. Pro. 6. b. from the Highest / and turne thesame to y^e Lowest or Humblest: and note|well theare in the Lowest, the faithfull Obedience. first-of-all, in the little or childish Singleminded|nes / and how that Faithfulnes, with the Good|willingones  and the Goodwillingones with Faithfulnes, do Ephe. 4. b. growe-vpp obedientlie, from out of the childish Singlemindednes, to the manlie Olde-aige of the Man Iesu Christ.
19. For-that-cause / humble you euen-so / for to set yourselues first-of-all; with vs, in the lowestNOTA or nethermost Luc. 14. b. Place of all the Humble and Obe|dientones / so shall yee then also right-well per|ceaue, that the lowlie Humbleones / and faithfull

Obedientones euen in the manlie Olde-aige of Iesu Christ; do in such-sort rightlie inherit with God and his Sainctes, the Highest of the Glorie of God and the Lambe. and the true Freedom of the Children of God and of all the Holyones of Christ, and therto the euerlastinge Life.
20. But yet many of you haue not ben able to  perceaue thesame: For yee are lett or hindred therin, through the Gen. 3. b. Seede of the olde Serpent, Ezech. 8. a. that greeuous  horrible Beast of the Bottomles-pit / which with his Knowledge, contrarie to the Re|quiring of the Lorde  and with his Stoole of Dis|obedience, hath set himself on the North, 2. Tess. 2. a. in the Temple of y^e Lorde / wheare the gratious Woorde of the Lorde and his Requiringe, is now through our Fellowe-elder HN; administred vnto Manye.
21. Which horrible Beast, hath marred and corrupted all the Vnderstandinge of Man, in the Knowledge / and hath euenso alwayes ben a Lett to the Children of Men, in their corrupt Vnder|standinge / and with his Knowledge contrary to the Requiringe of the Woorde of y^e Lorde; hindred them for entring-in to the right Entraunce of the true Life / and for turning-againe aright vnto the God of their Saluation.
22. And thatsame horrible Beast Gen. 3. b. Ezech. 8. a. the Seede of the olde Serpent is now also in the last tyme, most-dammaigefull  pernitious vnto you all O yee Children of Men; in your Sight / Hearinge / and Vnderstanding, for to com to the Obedience of the Requiringe of the Woorde: and that also theefliest turneth you out of the Waye that leadeth to the true Life / and bringeth you into a 2. Tess. 2. b. secreat

Errour, which yee through the Lett of that most|greeuous and detestable Beast; cannot well per|ceaue / for that thesame is ouer-all, most-chieflie esteemed amonge the Children of Men / and hath in all their Wayes; plucked or 2. Cor. 11. a. drawen them into a contrarye Minde / wherin they notwith|standing suppose that they are in the right.


The Seconde Chap.
ANd albeit now that many Men per|swade  themselues, that they turne them onlie to God and his Woorde / and walke in the Waye to the Life / yet turne not they themselues to the true God and his Woorde of Life, in any right-maner / nether haue they also founde 4. Esd. 7. a. the Waye to the true Life: For they turne|away themselues from the gratious Woorde of the Lorde, which in his Seruice of Loue, doth seruiceablie set-fourth and expresse vnto them in their Esa. 59. a. Seperation or Disiunction from God and his vpright Beeinge; the first Entraunce of the right Waye to the Life / to thend that they should euenso becom turned-about therin, to the Math. 18. a. childish Singlemindednes  and plucked to the true Obedi|ence of the Requiringe of the Woorde of y^e Lorde: and that they mought then euenso rightlie and accordinge to the Trueth; com-againe to their God  and inherit the true Life of God  and the vpright Beeinge of the Loue of Iesu Christ. But many refuse thissame / and turning them vnto themselues, they applie them to geeue-eare vnto that Ezech. 8. a. horrible and mischeuous Beast, which in|habiteth

with them / and hath set himself in them with his Stoole of Disobedience; on the North, in the Temple of the Lorde  and euenso brought|in and placed his Woorde of Knowledge, against the Woorde of Life of the true liuinge God, by and amonge them / and they let themselues becom very|shamefullie seduced through thesame.
2. Verelie / thissame Beast the seducinge Seede of the olde Serpent is a terrible Beast, before the Eyes of all the Holyones / inasmuch as that hee is risen-vpp out of the Apo. 17. b. Bottomles-pitt [that is, out of the Seperation from God-his Beeinge]: and is the Esa. 5. b. 59. b false Light of the Knowledge itself / which in all his Nature and Disposition, is very false and deceitfull / and bringeth-vnto ether he|riteth the disobedient Man, with the Iere. 17. b. most-wilie and mischeuous Heart.
3. And forasmuch as that thesame Beast is so exceeding false  and so hindersom or dammaigefull vnto all Men, concerning the right Entraunce to the Life / and planteth so great Falshod in them / So ought all Men therfore, to take good-heede of thesame / and to staye or Deut. 4. a. Pro. 3. a. 6. b. holde themselues so|much the faster and faithfuller on the gratious Woorde of the Lorde and his Requiringe / and to passe-fourth therin obedientlie / vntill that thesame false and deceaueable Seede of the olde Serpent / together with his disobedient Knowledge, be dam|ned and buryed Apo. 17. b. 19. d. in the Bottomles-pitt, wherout it came-fourth.
4. For / so-longe as it sitteth in the Man with  his Dominion, on his Stoole of Disobedience / and is had chiefliest in estimation of the Children of

Men / So doth thesame appeere or glinse so migh|tilie with his false Light of the Knowledge; before the Eyes of Men / that they Pro. 3. a. sa. 5. b. 59. a. suppose thesame to be the true Light of the Wisdome of God. also it bloweth his Knowledge to the Tourning-in o Men vnto Phil. 2. . their Self-seekinge; so forciblie into their Eares, that they conceaue it to be the very Woord of the Lorde (For they applie them glad|lie accordinge to the Requyringe of thesame Knowledge). It taketh likewise their Vnder|standinges captiue so mightelie therin, that they suppose thesame Captiuitie to be their Freedom: And for-that-cause also so-longe as they heare and beleeue thesame; they cannot by anye-meanes see / heare / nor beleeue the true Obedience and Faithfulnes / nor the Forsakinge of their Self|seekinge the which is required out of the Math. 16. c. Luk. 9. c. 14.  Woord of the Lorde and his Seruice of Loue; to an Entraunce into the Doctrine or Discipline of Iesu Christ   nether-yet go-fourth nor perseuer con|stantlie therin.
5. Also they cannot rightlie vnderstand, how they ought according to the Requiringe of the Woorde of the Lorde and of his Seruice of Loue; to let themselues be prepared Luk. 1. . to an vpright People of the Lorde / vnlest they vtterlie Math. 16. c. Luk. 9. 14. c. forsake and leaue the venemous Seede of the olde Serpent and his Requiring of Disobedience  and also their Selfnes which they seeke therin: and euenso turne them about to the Math. 18. a. childish Singlemindednes / and not respect or waye the Perrell of the Fleashes Dam|maige: but turne them whollie and altogether, to the Inwarde-beholdinge of the Math. 10. c. 16. c. Luk. 1. . Hinderaunce of

the Soule and of the vpright Righteousnes / and to the Inspection of the Preseruation of thesame, to a Remnaunt in the euerlastinge Immortalitie / for to accomplish euenso the Lord-his Will. to en|ter-in to the Obedience of the Requiringe of the Woorde of the Lorde. and to fulfill Math. . . all Righteous|nes obedientlie: and not let themselues lust after anye other thinge.
6. Yea / so should they then out of the Obe|dience of the Requiringe of the gratious Woorde and Seruice of Loue; learne to perceaue, the vp|right Consubstantiation Iohn. 6. e. 17.  or Vnifourme-vnitinge, which the Man ought to haue with God and his vpright Beeinge / and also what-maner of Loue hee ought to beare towardes an other: and that the|same forementioned greeuous Beast, is Ezech. 8 a. Apo. 17. b. the wicked and horrible Beast, whose Generation hath tho|rough thatsame Wickedone; killed or Act. 17. e. murdered y^NOTA Witnesses of God and Christ  and the holie Za|charias the 2. Para. 24. c. Math. 23. e. Sonne of Barachias, betwixt the Temple and the Aulter [that is: betwixt the En|traunce into the Sanctuarie / and the Fulfillinge of the Offeringe ether Godseruice in thesame]. also caused the Dan. 8. b. daylie Offeringe ether Godseruice to ceasse. and brought the whole Howse of the Lorde, which Hee had chosen vnto himself for his Dwelling, in vtter desolatio~ 4. Reg. 25. . Psal. 74. 79. a. Esa. 64. d. with Abhominatio~s.
7. Also they should well perceaue, that the Re|uendgment of all giltlesse Bloud which from the Beginninge til-vnto this present Daye of the Ma|nifestation of the Iudgment of God, is shead vpon the Earth; shall com Math. 23. d. Apo. 6. . 16.  ouer thatsame wicked Ge|neration, to his vtter Rooting-out and Con|demnation:

and also how and wher-through, that the mischeuous Beast and his Generation, hath euen hetherto, ben a very mightie Lett vnto all Men, for to assemble them to God-his Witnesses: and doth yeat also presentlie now in the last time, hinder very many, for to go-in vnder the Obedi|ence of the Loue; to the Entraunce of the vpright Godlines.
8. BEholde / how cleere and apparant all  thissame is set-fourth before you all O yee Children of Men; which heare vs / and how distinctlie, both the Deut. 11. 30. b Eccli. 15. c. Destruction and also the Pre|seruation, becometh out of God-his Grace; pre|figured vnto you. For-that-cause / learne now once to consider and marke, that yee all erre / and haue wicked Eyes  and much Euel-surmisinge among you: as also that your Eyes are en. 3. . opened through that greuous  horrible Beast the false Light of y^ Knowledge / and hee hath geue~ you to vnderstand, that yee in your Vnregeneration; should take-on the Freedom, for to be disobedient to the Requi|ringe of the gratious Woorde of the Lorde. Pro. 1. . Esa. 5. . to contemne and resist the Lord-his proffered Grace and the Minister of his Woorde. and to turne|away yourselues therfrom.
9. For-that-cause, withdrawe now your Eyes from thesame wicked Sight / and turne you about hether, to the Life of the Trueth / and becom coun|selled in-time, to turne the Sight of your Eyes vnto the Lust to accomplish the Will of the Lorde /  to be obedient vnto y^e Requiring of his Woorde / So shall yee then perceaue and knowe, that the Sentence-of-iudgment and the Doctrine set-fourth

by HN, is proceeded from out of the liuinge God: and that the Obedience to the Requiring of the|same, trayneth and leadeth men into the true Life, which God accepteth /  is the Mans Saluation.
10. Yee shall then also right-well insee and vn|derstand, that thesame Obedience, is the Iohn. . . vpright Freedom of the Children of God: and that the true Life, wher-vnto thesame Obedience bringeth-men, is the vpright and Iohn. 1. . true Light of Men: and that all other Lightes and Freedomes which are with|out thesame, cannot bide-standinge before God nor his Holyones.
11. Moreouer / yee shall insee and perceaue or vnderstand, that the Disobedience is not any Free|dom. but is the Subiection or 2. Pet. 2. c. Bondaige to the Sinne  to the Self-will of Man  and to y^e Might of the Deuell / of the Hell / and of the Fleash (to|weet, that those-same haue the Dominion ouer and in the Disobedience) and that thesame Disobedience beareth alwaies a Care or resteth mindfull, of all what concerneth the Fleash / but is verie-little care|full of that which concerneth the Soule and the vp|right Beeinge of God: and that also therfore, all the Esa. 59. a. Lightes and 2. Pet. 2. a. Freedomes of the vnrepentant and vnregenerated Men, are false and deceitfull / and bringe-in or stirre-vp Breach / Dissention / and Offenciuenes, among the Children of Men / and euenso turne-away the Children of Men from the Mercifulnes Mich. 6. a. Math. 1. c.  and Forgeeuinge of Sinnes which they owe one towardes an-other: as also from the peaceable Concorde of the vpright brotherlie Loue / and from the vpright Beeing of God  his Christ.
12. Also that all vnregenerated Men, which 

haue regarde and geeue-eare vnto these false Lightes and Freedomes, becom therwithall very shamefullie seduced / and that those-same are also very hindersom vnto them, for to com to y^ humble and obedient Singlemindednes of Iesu Christ and his Loue: For they all leade-men away from the|same / as also from the Waye which reacheth ther|vnto.
13. FOr-that-cause O yee Children of Men; holde you Eccli. 2. a. Heb. 12. a. stedfastlie on the Woorde of the Lorde and his Requiring / and on the Loue and Mercifulnes, Rom. 13. a. which yee are deptours to keepe and shew-fourth towardes euery-one: and suffer not yourselues to be withdrawen at any time, from the safe-makinge Testimonies of God and his holie Spirit of Loue / which haue ben out of entire Loue; to all your Preseruation, healde-fourth by our Fellow-elder HN, before you / and which are also yeat dailie borne before you: For out of those-same, yee may readelie conceaue the true and vpright Beeing of the regenerated Men  and their true Freedom with the Children of God: as also vn|derstand, wherto yee are created  and called or bid|den, through the Seruice of the Loue: And yee shall euenso well perceaue, the pernitious Seducinge of the Sap. 2. a. 14. b. Rom. 1. c. 2. Pet. 2. b. false Freedom of all vnregenerated Men, wherof yee are presentlie warned.
14. Thus beware that yee eate not Act. 15. . of ThatNOTA which is strangled in the Bloud. go not to the Aulters of the Heathen or Vncircumcised / for to offer-vp your willing Guiftes theron to the Lorde. haue not any Lust for to eate 1.

1. Cor. 5. b. with their Vncleannes. go not in also to their Howse-of-laughter / inasmuch as thesame assuredlie; lieth altogether desolate. nether reioyce you with the Vnrepentant: but turne you ther|from / Eccle. 7. a. and go much-rather into the Howse-of-la|mentation or Mourning-howse; Esa. 66. a. wheare the Littleones and Poore are / wheare y^ Goodwillinge and Obedientones are / and wheare the Humble and Lowlie  the Mercifull and Meeke-minded  and the Math. 5. a. Hungrie and Thirstie after the Righ|teousnes, are: and wheare-as also ther is Sorrowe borne and Repentaunce shewed for the Sinne: and ther-out let your Ioye / Freedom / and Peace  and all your Familiaritie or Common-heartednes / Loue / and Wisdome, haue his proceeding / and be brought-fourth / So shall yee then vnderstand aright, that I haue writen and administred the Trueth vnto you: and that this Counsell of the Wisdome, is not of Man  but of God.
15. Therfore take now in-tyme, the Counsell  of the Wisdome albeit that thesame is dispised of many; and thissame distinct or cleere Instruction, effectuallie Pro. 2. 4. . to heart / and assemble you all vnto vs / and to our Seruice of Loue: and in thesame Ser|uice, let all your Vnderstanding becom renewed / to a right Inspection of the vpright Beeing, wherin the Man ught concordablie; to stande com|prehended: To thende that ther mought be founde among vs all that loue the Righteousnes, one con|cordable Minde, Rom. 12. 15. 1. Cor. 1. a. to the Vnitie of Heart  one vp|right Dealinge  and one mutuall brotherlie Walk|inge, euenlike as it is meete and  right.
16. Heer-vnto let vs becom Phil. 2. . like minded / and

passe-fourth concordablie with goodwilling Hear|tes; after thesame: and not looke how Certen in times-passed; haue walked and spoke~ / for to retaine any Matier against anyone to the worst or to his reproch: Math. 18. d. Ephe. 4. c. Col. 3. b. but laye it all downe  not thinke theron anymore: and let vs eue~so turne our whole Sight, for to beholde wher-vnto wee were created and chosen / and what a Loue and Mercie wee Rom. 13. b. are deptours to exte~d or shewe one towardes another: and ther-vnto let vs loue and be seruiceable one towardes another: and euenso enter into the true Life / and then speake or talke therof.


The Thirde Chap.
HEare now therfore the Woorde of  the Lorde and his Requiringe, O yee Children of Men: forasmuch as that the false Esa. 5. b. 59. a Math. 6. c. Light of y^ deceitfull Knowledg, hath euery-wheare brought-in and placed his Stoole of Disobedience, amo~g all vnrepentant vnregenerated Men: and that now in this Daye, y^ Manifestati|on or Declaringe of all Thinges that are in Heaue~ and vpon Earth both of the Perfect and also of the Vnperfect; becometh through the seruiceable Tes|timonies of the holie Spirit of Loue; administred and declared, so cleere and expreslie vnto  / So let vs now then respect-well this 2. Cor. 6. a. Gal. 6. . gratious Time / and diligentlie applye vs with each-other concord|ablie; in thesame / that the wel-prepared Esa. 16. c. Stoole of Obedience of the true Light of Life (which pre|sentlie in thissame Daye of the Loue to an euer|lasting Stoole-of-grace; is com vnto vs from Hea|uen,

vpon the Earth / and wheron also the Faith|fulnes doth sitt, Esa. 16. . 32. a. with Iudgment and Mercie) mought now be erected euery-wheare by all vs which loue the Righteousnes in Iesu Christ; a|gainst the Stoole of the Disobedience of the false Light of the Knowledge (which it hath brought|fourth and lifted-vpp out of the Bottomles-pitt, to a Stoole of Indignation on the North; in the Temple of the Lorde: and wheron the Vnfaith|fulnes, with his vnmercifull Iudgment hath sett himself): and that euenso thesame Stoole of Obe|dience, mought be planted Iam. 1. c. with Meckminded|nes; into all Louers of the vpright Righteousnes.
2. For through the Erectinge of thesame / and in that wee all which loue the vpright Righteousnes, consent and geeue-ouer ourselues according to the Requiring of the gratious Woorde and his Ser|uice of Loue; ther-vnto, wee shall rightlie and ac|cording to the Trueth, be brought to the true freedom Iohn. 8. c. of the Children of God  Math. 13. f. taught to the Kingdom of Heauens  and Iohn. 15. a. 17. c. implanted to the vp|right Beeing of Iesu Christ.

5. Therfore, followe not now y^e Deu. 12. a. Esa. 5. b. Goodthinkin of your Heartes: but ensue the Requiringe of the Testimonies of the Trueth. For in this Daye of the Trueth, which wee presentlie declare / it shall all whatsoeuer is Trueth / and of the Trueth / and also all Act. 3. . that which God hath spoken through his Pro|pheates, from the Beginninge of the Worlde, be|com now restored  Agg. 2. a. b.

in the last tyme, is extending ouer all Men on th Earth, to their Preseruation in the Godlines / to thend that they all, which are captiued w^t Sinnes and estraunged from their vpright State / and from the good Beeing of God, should be warned (ereuer the Iudgment of God fall vpon them) o the terrible Miserie and Condemnation, Math. 24. c.

12. And if now it were so yee Deerlie-beloued; that som of you had benPro. 6. 14. a. negligent or sluggish, in that which the gratious Woorde of the Lorde and his Seruice of Loue requireth  and turned you away from the Doctrine of the Woorde and Ser|uice of Loue / and from Vs the Lordes and your Ministers yet remaine not therfore seperated from vs / nor from our Doctrine of your Godlynes: but turne you againe to thesame / and assemble you euenso againe with goodwilling Heartes; to the Gratious-stooleHeb. 5. a. of the Remission of all Sinnes, for the which Sorrowe or Contrition is shewed / and Repentaunce don: and haue euenso out of Loue, your communion or mutual-societie; againe with vs / wherby yee mought then also with vs, haue your communio~1.

8. For seeinge that the Dominion of the false Light,4. Esdr. 14. b. Math. 24. b. raigneth now so mightelie in the wicked Worlde and in her Adherentes, with al-maner of Falshod and Malitious-subtiltie: and that likewise many Adherentes of the wicked Worlde, haue a Lust and stand-inclined thervnto / So is now also the Destruction of the wicked Worlde and her Ad|herentes, com harde-at-hande / accordinge to the Scriptures: For theEzech. 7. . Math. 24. b. c Ende of the wicked Worlde cometh vpon all the fower Corners of the Lande. Yea, euen-now in the Iudgment4. Esd. 13. d. Iudae. . b. of God with all his Holyones; cometh the Ende ouer her: For nowEzech. 7. a. will the Lorde send-fourth his Indignation  

and Apoc. 6. c. the Lambe his Wrath, ouer her / and iudge her, according as shee hath deserued: and let all that com vpon her, which appertaineth to her Abhomi|nations for to receaue.
9. Thus becom heer-withall admonished / and make not yourselues in any-wise; familier nor of|one-beeinge with any-thinge that cleaueth vnto the wicked Worlde / that yee perrish not therwith: For the Ezech. 7. a. Eye of the Lorde shall not spare the wicked Worlde  nor anye of all those which cleaue vnto her / nether-yet also looke vpon her, to her Excusati|on. . Esdr. 13. c. Apoc. 18. b. c. but will let com vpon her and her Ministers, like as they haue deserued.
10. For-that-cause / haue now a right regard, vpo~ all the Abhominations of the wicked Worlde / that yee may keepe yourselues seperated from thesame: But not from vs nor our Docu|mentes, which loue and are seruiceable vnto you, to your Preseruation in the Godlines: Ezech. 3. . and warne you of the Abhominations of the wicked Worlde and her Destruction / to thende that yee should not perrish with her. For I fore-tell you assuredlie, that the Abhominations of y^ wicked Worlde (haue therfore a circumspect consideration heeron, O yee Children of Men) shall breake-in among you / and yee shall likewise be vehementlie assaulted therwith.
11. Neuerthelesse / if yee holde you firmlie to the Requiring of the gratious Woorde and his Ser|uice of Loue / yee shall then be deliuered from the wicked . 2. a. Ephe. 6. c. Heb. 12. a. Assaultinges which com against you, out of the Abhominations of the wicked Worlde  and out of the Falshod of our Resisters / and inherit the Crowne Sap. 3. . 2. Tim. 4. . of the eternall Life / and the true Annoin|tinge

Psal. 45. b. 1. Iohn. 2. c. of the Ioyful-oyle of the holie Spirit of the Loue of Iesu Christ: and euenso finde-by-experi|ence, that our God of Loue, is the true Lorde / and that Wee his obedient Communialtie of the Loue are his acceptable People: and that also they all, which bide estraunged from thesame God. as also remaine with-out vs and our Communialtie  and with-out the Requiringe of the gratious Woorde and his Seruice of Loue / or withdrawe themselues therfrom, haue no liuing God nor-yet true Godser|uice: Ephe. 2. b. but are without God and without Godser|uice, in this Worlde. For our God 1. Iohn. 4. . of Loue, is the true liuing God / and Esa. 43. 44. 2. besides Him, ther is no God more. and his Godseruice of Loue which wee minister vnder the Obedience of his Loue; is the true safe-making Godseruice / and besides thesame, ther is not any Godseruice more, nether in Heauen nor-yet vpon Earth.
12. Therfore is our God, a God and Life of his vpright Beeinge / and a God  Life of his People, which loue his vpright Beeinge / and haue a Psal. 4. . Lust to accomplish his Will, vnder the Obedience of his Loue: and thesame our God, is also an Enemie and Death vnto all false Beeinge of y^ peruerse World / and an Enemie  Death vnto all Vngodlie which hate his vpright Beeinge / and resist his Will  and the Obedience of the Requiringe of his Woorde. And therfore our God of Loue, is . 1. . a God that so|ueth the true Righteousnes / and hateth all vngod|lie Beeing: and in such-like-sort wee also with Him, euen with all Inclination to doo his Will.
13. Therfore goeth now also Esa. 2. 8. Mic. 4. . the Woord of the  Lorde out of Ierusalem ouer the peruerse World,

to her Destruction: but ouer all Beleeuers and O|bedientones of the gratious Woorde, to their Pre|seruation in the Godlines; and warneth vs all / to|gether with all those which cleae with vs vnto the Requiringe of the gratious Woorde of the Lorde and his Seruice of Loue, of the terrible Esa. 13. a Mal. 4. a. Destruc|tion that is for to com vpon the wicked Worlde and her Abhominations  and vpon all those that bide without vs and our Seruice of Loue / and re|sist our God and his gratious Woord of Life / and speaketh euen-thus:
14. O Yee Children of Men / Math. 2. c. attende or watch now all on the Destructio~ which is for to com. Ezech. 7. a. For so / the one Infelicitie cometh vpon another: The one Woe goeth before / and the other Woe followeth thervpon much-more ri|gorous: And albeit that the one Night passeth-o|uer by many / and that they then suppose, that it is becom Daye with them, in their Vnregeneration / and that the Infelicitie hath not com-nye or light|ed-on them in the fore-goinge Night / yet are they not therfore escaped the Infelicitie / nether shall the other Nightes bide-backe or not com vpon them: but they shall all followe vpon y^ fore-going Night / and euerye sondrie Night shall make-manifest and bringe with him, his owne Infelicitie and Destruc|tion ouer them / vntill that the last most-horrible Night be com vpon them, in vnmeasurable and vn|queanchable Destruction.
15. OH! what an vnmeasurable Woe, com|eth-ther  ouer the wicked Worlde: and also ouer all them that cleaue vnto her / and shewe|fourth Rom. 2. a. no Repentaunce / nor will assemble them,

wher-vnto they are called and bidden through the gratious Woord and his Seruice of Loue, to their Preseruation in the Godlines.
16. For-that-cause seperate you now all 4. Esd. 2. d. from the wicked World / and shew-fourth Repentaunce / and saue or ridde your Soule and Bodie from the Destruction / and forsake Math. 16. . Luk. 9. 14. d. all what is your owne / and bring vnto the Lorde that 2. Para. 30. which is His: For the Ende cometh. Beholde, Ezech. 7. b. it cometh swiftlie on / and beginneth alredie to make his Entraunce / and breaketh-thorowe verye stowtlie ouer the Inhabi|tantes of the Lande.
17. The Time of Destruction cometh / and the great terrible Miserie is harde-at-hande. Ezech. 7. b. Ther|fore, mourne not now ouer that which yee haue solde / reioyce not also ouer that which yee haue bought / but let him that mourneth, mourne for that the Iniquitie 4. Esd. 14. b. Math. 24. b. raigneth so mightesie / and let him that reioyceth, reioyce in the Intelligence of the true godlie Beeinge / and in the Hope of the tocom|ing Peace: For the Time of Destruction bringeth not els-what with it, but an Inspection of great Affliction / Dolour / and Miserie: Ezech. 7. b. and ther shall not be any Singinge heard therin, to the Ioyful|nes of Life. but all Bewayling and Rufulnes / and Seekinge of Death: For such an Endinge, will the Lorde now shortlie bring vpon the wicked World / and powre-fourth his Indignatio~, vpon them that are so full of Falshod: and will euenso fullie accom|plish his Wrath ouer them.


The V. Chap.
BEholde / now commeth the Daye: Lo / Ezech. 7. c. theare commeth hee / and breaketh|fourth / and shall not deferre him. For the Rodde doth blossom / the Prowde waxeth greene / and Tirannie hath made-vpp itself, to a Punnishment ouer the Vngodlie: in such-wise / that none of them nor of y^e Multitude of their Heapes, shall haue anye staye of Comfort ether Hope: For the Indignation of the Lorde passeth-fourth ouer all the Multitude of their Heapes: Ezech. 7. b. Yea, the Sworde raingeth-abrode in their Streates / and the Pestilence and Hunger is in their Howses.
2. They shall euen out of great Miserie; cast|fourth their Esa. 2. . 30. c. 31. c. Ezech. 7. b. 4. Esdr. 16. c. Siluer on the Streates / and esteeme their Golde and Bragginge-iewels or Riches, as Filthynes or Dirte. Soph. 1. c. Eccli. 5. b. For all this shall not deliuer them, in the Daye of the Wrath of the Lorde: ne|ther shall they also suffise their Sowles therwith / nor fill their Bellie therwith all: for all thatsame hath not wrought in them anye Reformation nor Righteousnes / but rather Offenciuenes and Ma|lice, to the ingendringe of Misdooinge: and they haue euenso vsed their Iewels or Riches, vnto Pryde / and made thesame to an Abhomination be|fore the Lorde.
3. OH! How full ofEzech. 7. c. Bloud-giltines are the Landes / and how full of Malitious|grudginge are the Cities: and how full of Vari|aunce and Resistaunce of the Loue, are their Inha|bitantes. Therfore hath the Lorde also deuysed to bringe vpo~ them, the most-wicked among the Hea|the~ or Vncircumcised / that they might seduce them to the very-worst / and counsell them to liue free, in

their sinfull Birth  in their Vnrepentaunce  and in their Vnregeneration: and then will the Lorde al|so take his occasion therout, to make-an-ende ofEzech. 7. c. the Pryde of the Presumpteous  and of the Tirannie of the Violent-oppressours / and to disclose the Pro|phanatingeThe Propha|natinge of their Assemblies, are the Feastiful|dayes of the V godly. or Vnhallowinge of their Assemblies: and will euenso reiect both them and also their El|ders or Wise (which they haue set-vpp / admitted / and chosen from amonge them-selues without the Loue and her Seruice; to be Elders or Wise  as also healde and esteemed them for Such) from the Presence of his Face.
4. Then shall manye of them, Ezech. 7. c. seeke after the  Peace which they now misse or haue lost / but it shall not be any-wheare to be founde amonge them. For Vexation and Trouble shall fall vpon them wher|euer they becom. and one euell Brute shall com ouer them after another. Then shall they diligentlie go vnto their Propheates, to seeke the Insight or Vi|sion of the Peace / and make-inquisition amonge their Elders, after the Wisdome and after the Or|dinaunce of the Lorde, to their Concorde.
5. But Ezech. 7. c. ther shall nether Wisdom / Ordinaunce of the Lorde / nor Vision of Peace  nether-yet any Counsell to Concord nor to Preseruation, be found by their Elders. Their Kinges or Gouernours shall then also be afflicted with great Heauynes  and their Princes clothed with Mourning-weede. For their Might and Dominion shall not be fea|red / and the Ezech. 7. b. Handes of the People in the Lande, shall finde themselues vnmightie  and their Heartes discomforted.
6. Yea / euen-then will the Lorde himself Esa. 2. b. with

his Arme / and with the Armes of his Holyones, be the true Iudge vpon the Earth / and cleanse the vniuersall Earth, Math. 3. b. Luk. 3. b. from all the Vnrighteousnes  Falshod that the Children of Men in their Vnre|pentaunce and Contemning of the Saluation; haue practised and erected on the Earth: and they shall eue~so perceaue-in-experience, that our God of Loue, is the true Lorde / and that Hee hath neuer willed the Ezech. 18. d 1. Tim. 2. a. 2. Pet. 3. a. Destructio~ of Men: but alwayes called them to Repentaunce / and to their Preseruation in the Godlynes / and warned them of the Destruction: euen-like as his Loue and Mercie doth also yeat presentlie in the last Daye, shew-fourth thesame.
7. O Yee Childre~ of Men, consider and note  aduisedlie, the great Loue and Goodnes that becometh yeat presentlie in the last Daye exten|ded on you / to your Preseruation in the Godlines: and how that yee are with this distinct Declaratio~ of the Deut. 11. c. Eccli. 15. c. Life and of the Death, visited out of entire Loue  required to com to the Psal. 45. b. Esa. 16. c. Heb. 1. b. 5. a. Gratious-stoole of the godlie Maiestie, which is com vnto vs on the Earth  and loued in Iesu Christ; for to haue one vniforme Heart and Minde with vs / To thende that yee mought haue your communion with vs / whilst surelie; our communion is 1. Ioan. 1. . with God the Father. with the Lorde Iesus Christ. and with the true Beeinge of the Holie-gost.
Take it to heart.
8. WIth this distinct Declaration, ther is euen out of Loue; required o you all O yee Children of Men; which heare the|same / or to whom it becometh administred / that e|ueryone;

vnto Concorde and Rom. 15. . 1. Cor. 1. . 2. Cor. 3. b. Vnitie-of-minde to the Loue; do open or make-manifest his Heart by vs, euenlike as wee do heare by him /  geeue Tes|timonie, whether that hee be of one Minde and Meaning heerin with vs / or-els whether that hee as repugnant vnto vs; desireth not to geeue his consent heerin.
9. For, inasmuch as that the vpright Goodwil|lingnes to God Math. 22. d. Eph. 1. 2. 4. b. and his synceere Righteousnes  and the true Common-heartednes of the Rom. 12. b. 1. Pet. 1. c. 3. b brotherlie Loue and Conuersatio~, is so nakedlie and expresslie set-fourth heerwith before you / So can yee also so|much-the-easelier feele  perceaue in your Heartes, whether that yee be goodwillinge with vs Little|ones and Lowlyones, to seeke-after the vpright Righteousnes  and after the true Familiaritie of brotherlie Loue: and whether that yee also desire in this Math. 24. b. 1. Tim. 4. a. 2. Tim. 3. a. 2. Pet. 2. . perrelous Time; our willinge Seruice, ther-vnto / and to your Preseruation in the Godli|nes: or that yee as repugnant vnto vs, are vnwil|ling thervnto: as also whether that yee with your Knowledge 1. Tim. 6. .; desyre to holde you backe and as Straungers, from thesame and from Vs / and not to haue your soscietie with vs / nor-yet do require any Seruice of Loue ther-vnto; at our handes.
10. Therfore let euerye-one now, freelie geeue  Testimonie heerof / and do yee yourselues, examine your owne-selues / whether that yee be Fellowe-be|leeuers with vs Littleones and Lowlyones, to the Beleef of the vpright Righteousnes and Ephe. 4. b. true Life of Iesu Christ: and euenso desire to go-out-from  forsake with vs vnder the Obedience of the Loue of Iesu Christ; all the Worldes Falshod / and all

that which ought not to be by the vpright Belee|uers of Iesu Christ, and so to be the Seruauntes of God, in his vpright Rom. 6. b. Righteousnes: or whe|ther that yee both against Vs / and also against the true Faith to the vpright Righteousnes, do rest vnbeleeuinge / and desire not, for God-his vpright Righteousnes cause or for to be the Seruauntes of God therin; to forsake the Loue of the Worlde  and all that which is worldlie and vnright / toge|ther with your owne Self-seekinge / nether-yet to consent or stand-willinge to thesame, whervnto yee are presentlie loued of vs.
11. Whosoeuer now then is 1. Cor. 1. a. 2. Cor. 13. b. concordablie-min|ded with vs to the good Life and vpright Beeinge (whervnto wee haue according to the Requiring of the gratious Woorde of the Lorde; whollie ge|uen-ouer our-selues / and all our Heart / Minde  and Soule, to a Esa. 10. c. Remnant in the Perrishinge o the wicked Worlde) and yealdeth his Voyce ther|in with vs / let him also expresse then therwith, hi Inclinable-affect to thesame good Life and vprigh Beeinge / and that hee consenteth therin / and hat an Heartie-lust and Desire to the Furtheraunce o the Seruice pertayninge to thesame.
12. Ouer Whom [namelie they that haue  Lust with vs to accomplish the Will of the Lorde and that receaue our Warninge for the auoyding of the Destruction  and our Doctrine to their Pre|seruation in the Godlines, in Thankes-geeuinge t the Lorde / and applie them diligentlie thervnto] w will also continuallie to their Preseruation in t Godlines; shew-fourth our good Care: For to|ardes such Goodwillingones / and humble Go

fearingones, wee  not spare oursel uiceable vnto them both Night and Daye; in this perrelous Time / inasmuch as they with vs, haue adioyned themselues with whole Heart; to the on|lie liuing God and the Requiringe of his gratious Woorde / and also loue Him / and haue a Psal. 40. . Lust to keepe his Commaundementes / and to fulfill Math. 3. c. all Righteousnes.
13. But those which refuse to conuersate them  with vs, accordinge to the Requiringe of the Loue and her Seruice / and beleeue Abac. 1. . Act. 13. c. not Gods Wonder|ful-woorkes and his Testimonies, set-fourth or brought-to-light by vs. but contemne / deride / and resist those-same and our Seruice, layed on vs by God: and also backbite and defame vs with much Falshod / ouer Those, wee will shewe-fourth Pa|cience and all Goodnes and 2. Cor. 4. a. Tit. 3. a. Discrectnes.
14. Neuerthelesse, therin wee Act. 20. c. excuse and cleere ourselues before them, as touchinge their Destruc|tion: as also of all that which shall com vpon them and their Children, by the Euell / wherof wee haue warned them / and they would in no-wise heare vs. And keepe euenso our Heartes and Conscience pure and vnspotted, from their Vnbeleef  Vnwilling|nes: Act. 13. turninge vs to the Beleeuers and Goodwil|lingones  and to the humble Godfearingones, which haue a Lust to walke in the Wayes of the Lorde / and to doo his Will / for to be alwaies ser|uiceable vnto Them, to the good Life / and for to bringe vnto them, the Declaration of the heauenlie Treasures  and of the louelie Beeinge of the 2. Cor. 3. b. vn|couered Face of God and Christ   as also of the Misterie Math. 13. a. Col. 2. . of the Kingdom of Heauens / all which

gones in their Vnbeleef; do vtterlie .
15. Let eueryone take this effectuallie to heart / and let noman refuse the good Beeinge, whervnto God hath created the Man  and called him tho|rough Iesus Christ and his Holyones / and wher|vnto hee is also presentlie loued, by the Communi|altie of the Loue of Iesu Christ.
16. Also let noman be ashamed, to be adioyned vnto the Goodnes of God and the Requiringe of his gratious Woorde / and to confesse thesame / ne|ther let him also refuse to assemble him vnto vs / and to geeue Testimonie, that hee desireth to endeuour himself accordinge to the Requiringe heerof / and consenteth or agreeth therin with vs: and so to let his inclined Goodwillingnes appeere, that hee in|tendeth or meaneth with Heart, the Seruice of Loue  and the Ministration to thesame that is healde-fourth before him: like-as ther is also . 42. d. c. Reue. 9. d. . re|quyred ether desired in the Euangelie of the King|dom, set-fourth by God-his chosen Minister HN.
17. Take it to heart: and let eueryone respect-well thissame proffered Grace / and let noman har|den his Heart ther-against.
