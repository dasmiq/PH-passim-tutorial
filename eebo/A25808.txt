TO THE Truly Vertuous and Accomplisht Gent.

The Publisher of this COMEDY wisheth Health and Happinesse everlasting.

Noble Gent.
_IT was the happinesse of my starres, to have known you long ago, as the very Eye of our Garden of England; all which both admire and love you: And it is the height of my ambition, to salute your hands, that love Honesty, with the Comedical advancement of Honesty. I am confident, what Aristophanes and his Translator have pen|cill'd in this kind, you love to own, though drawn out in a weak Sci|ography. But you had rather see it performed in mens lives, then personated on the Stage; rather represented in action, then acted in speculative representations. I crave your courteous Patronage, suffi|cient Panoply even against Envy it self. I prostrate it to your judi|cious Test (at vacant houres) to approve of, and of my self too, who am
Your humble Servant and Admirer,
F. I.



The Preface to the Reader.
READER,
THis is a pleasant Comedy, though some may judge it Sa|tyrical: 'Tis the more like Aristophanes the Father: be|sides, if it be biting, 'tis a biting Age we live in; Then biting for biting. Again, Tom Randal, the Adopted Sonne of Ben Iohnson, being the Translator hereof, followed his Fathers steps; They both of them loved Sack, and harmlesse Mirth, and here they shew it; and I (that know my self) am not a|verse from it neither. This I thought good to acquaint thee with. Farewell.
Thine, F. I.



To his worthy Friend, F. I. On the setting forth of this excellent COMEDY.

TO joyn things so divided in this Age,
Shews thy rare master-piece of Wit right sage.
Out of th' Athenian-Sea to draw it forth,
Commends not only learned skill, but worth.
I mean both Honesty and Wealth: so rare
Do these two Planets in Conjunction share
Of one mans breast: Their divers Aspects shine
Maligne (like Saturn) in Sextile or Trine,
To each ingenuous soule. I know, our Nation
Would fain obscure this luminous Constellation:
But thou hast rescued it and set it free,
In the bright Orb of Ingenuitie.
Go on brave soule! let each Heroick spirit
Know 'tis allied to Riches as by merit.
Vindicate them: while Muck-worm-minded men
Feel the sharp dint of thy incensed Pen.
Doom them to Dunghils; and thy potent scorn
Not lend them hose to put on head or horn!

G. P.



The Argument or Subject of the Comedy.
CHremylus an honest decaied Gentleman, willing to become rich, repaireth to the Oracle of Apollo to enquire how he might compasse his designe: The Oracle en|joyneth him to follow that man whom he first met with, and never part from his company. The man he met is the old blind God of Wealth disguised. After this, Chremylus calleth his poor (but honest) Neighbours to partake of his happinesse. The honest party rejoyce at the news; Rascals only and vitious persons are discontented. Plutus is led to the Temple of Esculapius, by whose art and help he recovereth his eye-sight. At this Knaves are even mad, they mrmure and complain exceedingly. Likewise the Goddesse Poverty, that aforetime had great power in the Land, complaineth that her scepter is al|most broken to peeces: thereupon she raiseth wars, but is roued; she also is vanquished in disputation of the necessity of Poverty. Knaves again salute Weeping-crosse, as well as Pennylesse-bench. Nay, the Pope himself is even starved. Lastly, to vexe them more, the God of Wealth is introduced married to Honesty.

Hey for Honesty, down with Knavery.

Act. 1.

Scaen. 1.
Enter Plutus stumbling on the Stage, after him Chremylus and Carion

Carion.
_OBonny Iove, and the rest of the bon gods that dwel in the Tipling-house of Olympus! There be mettals  hard things in the world, but nothing so hard as to be bound Prentise in Bedlam, and have a Fool to ones Master: my very Livery is faced with his VVorships foolery. Our condition is miser|able; for if our Masters but dine at the Ordi|nary of mischief, the poore Serving-man is sure to be fed with the scraps of misfortune: We must share of our Masters misery, we are but Tenants, they will not let us be Free|holders to the petty Lordships of our own corpusculous Fortune; damnable Fortune! how fatally hast thou sold the tenure of us, to him that will pay us our wages! 'Tis very true that I tell you: And now see the per|verse effects of all. O how I could cuff Apol|lo! I have a quarrel to Apollo, that wryleg'd, ridling, fidling god, that snorts out Oracles from his guilded brundlet. They say, this same Gaffer Phoebus is a good Mountebanck, and an excellent Musitian; but a deuse on him, it does not seem so, he has sent my Ma|ster home so sick of Melancholy, that I dae swear, this scurvy Tom Piper of Dlphos did not play him so much as one fit of mirth, not a lig or Sellengers-round. And now see how he follows a blind Puppy i' th' taile, contrary to Law or Reason: For we that have our eys should lead, not follow the blind. The very Dog in the Chronicles, that had his eyes, stood upon his royal Prerogative, of going before the blinde Beggar of Bednal-green. Nor can he be content to doe it himself, but he must make me too guilty of the same ig|norance. If I but ask him a question, he hath not so much manners as my Granam's Sow; I cannot get him to grunt me an an|swer: yet I cannot choose but speak, though my hedge of Teeth were a Quick-set, my tongue would through. You sir, that say you are my Master, if you doe not tell me why we follow this blundring guide, be sure, I will never leave vexing and tormenting you: you shall tell me, that you shall.


Chr.
O the Age we live in! Sirra, quintes|sence of impudence! To what a fine passe are you arrived?


Car.
Nay 'tis e'en so Sir: Your sword and buckler man must take the wit upon him for once.


Chr.
But if you do not learn your distance ber; look, is not here a Crabtree-Cudgel

beware of weeping-Crosse.


Car.
Master, I am priviledg'd: Do you see my Feather? so long as I wear this, 'tis Shrove-tuesday with us Prentises, perpetual Shrove-tuesday.


Chr.
But if I take off your Feather, then we shall have you presently crest-fa'n, and then my Crabtree Tutor here may read a Lecture of Ethicks to your saucy Shoulders.


Car.
Why, and if it do sir; you shall finde that I have as valiant Shoulders as another man. Come exercise your cudgel: You Ma|sters are like Roman Magistrates, you have Rods of authority; yet try, see whether you or I will be first weary. Come you Trifle, all the Cudgels in Christendome, Kent, or New-England, shall never make me quiet, till you shew me who this is we follow. Why, sweet|honey, sugar-cinnamon, delicate Master, if I did not wish you well, do you think I would be so inquisitive? In dud la you must tell me, and I shall be satisfied.


Chr.
Well, I have not the power to con|ceale thee any longer; for of all my servants, thou art so trusty, true-hearted, faithful and honest, that I dare swear there is not an ar|ranter theif amongst 'um.


Car.
Now heaven blesse your Worship. I have alwayes had your Worships commenda|tions, pray Iove I may deserve it! Proceed good Sir.


Chr.
Well, thus it is: In the dayes of my folly, I was a just, precise, and honest man.


Car.
'Twas in the dayes of your folly you were a Precisian, I my self was almost half a one once, but I am converted.


Chr.
VVell, being honest, I was by natu|ral consequence very poor.


Car.
VVho knew not that? Though I know not what your honesty was; yet I am sure there is never a gut in my belly but may swear for your poverty. Nay, and you had no more wit then to be honest in this wise age, 'twere pitty but you should live and dye a beggar.


Chr.
But others, such as your demure Chea|ters,


Car.
That have the true gogle of Amster|dam;


Chr.
VVith some corrupted Law-gowns, Ploydes Pupils.


Car.
That can plead on both sides for Fees;


Chr.
With Round-headed Citizens, and Cuckolds,


Car.
I sir, and Townsmen.


Chr.
These, I say, grew rich the while.


Car.
Damnable rich. Faith, master, such miracles have not ceased in these dayes: I have known many in these times have grown rich out of a poor estate, the devil knows how not I.


Chr.
Therefore I repaired to Delphos to ask counsel of Apollo, because I saw my self almost arrived at Gravesend, to know if I should bring up my son suitable to the thri|ving trades of this age we live in, viz. to be a Sequestrator, or Pettifogger, or Infor|mer, or Flatterer, or belonging to Knights o'th Post, or a Committee-mans. Clark, or some such excellent , clothing himself from top to toe in knavery, without a welt or guard of goodnesse about him. For I see, as the times go now, such thriving education will be the richest portion I can leave him


Car.
I Sir, leave but your sonne, the le|gacie of Dishonesty, and J will warrant him he shall out-thrive all VVestminster-Hall, and all

To your demand what did Don Phoebus mutter?
VVhat answer through his Laurel-garland stutter?



Chr.
You shall heare. He bid me in plain terms, whomsoever I first met withall, him I should follow, and never leave his company till he came home.


Car.
And was this peece of darknesse the first you met with? Now in my conscience he was begot at midnight, goodman Mid|night, and retains the quality of the season. None to meet but Blind-man-buffe, that winks at all faults!


Chr.
This is the very man.


Car.
Troth, and he may tell you your for|tune, Gypsie-like, and all out of your pockets too; He may shew you your destiny: He looks like one of the blind whelps of my old Lady Chance. Ha, ha, ha! Master, though you be born to lands, I see a poor Serving|man may have as large inheritance of wit as

a Justice of Peace. VVhy, and't please your Ignorance, any man of brains might easily understand the Gods meaning: why, he bids you bring up your sonne to claim the grand Charter of the City, viz. to be as arrant a Knave as his Countrymen. For truly,

A blind man may see, though he never see more,
That the way to be honest, is the way to be poore.



Chr.
The Oracle doth not tend that way; there is some greater mysterie in it, if this old Cupid would but tell us who he is. Come let's follow him close, perchance we may find out some other meaning.


Car.

On other meaning perchance we may pitch.
This is the way to be weary, though not to be rich.


Musick. Exeunt ambo.


Act. 1. Scaen. 2.
Enter Chremylus, Carion.

Car.
Master, we have run a terrible long wild-goose chace after this blind Beetle: for my part I sweat every inch of me, one drop fetches another. As for my shooes, you must needs give me a new paire. Their ungodly souls are e'en ready to depart, they are giving up the ghost: And yet we walk like the em|blem of silence; we have not put our blind Gentleman-Usher to any interrogatories. You sir, Homer the second! first I command you in fair terms tell us who you are: if com|mands will not serve the turn, my cudgel shall intreat you.


Chr.
You were best tell us quickly too.


Plu.
I tell you, the Devil take you.


Car.
Do you hear what he sayes, master? The good old Gentleman bids your Worship good morrow.


Chr.
He speaks to thee that askt him so clownishly. Sir, if you like the behaviour of a civil Gentleman, do me in courtesie the favour as to tell me who you are.


Plu.
Why, all the Devils in hell, and as many more confound thee too.


Car.
Nay, nay, take him to you, master: keep your Apollo's Oracle to your self; I have no share in it.


Chr.
Now if thou doest not tell me, by Ceres I will use thee like a Villain as thou art.


Plu.
Good Gentlemen, let me be behold|ing to you for one infinite favour.


Chr.
What's that?


Plu.
Why, to let me be rid of your com|pany.


Car.
Master, be ruled by a wiser man then your self, for once, and follow my counsel: Let us take this same old Appius, that has lost the use of his natural spectacles, and carry him to the top of the castle-hill, and there leave him to tumble down and break his neck ere he come to the bottome.


Chr.
Let it be quickly then.


Car.
I, and then wee'll leave him to be hanged the next Assizes, for being a cessory to his own death.


Plu.
Nay, good merciful Gentlemen!


Car.
Will you tell us then, you Owle?


Chr.
You Bird of the Night, will you tell us?


Plu.
I will never tell you: for if you but once know who I am, ten thousand to one but you will do me some mischief, you will never let me go.


Chr.
By heaven we will, if you please.


Plu.
List then and give ear: for, as far as I can see, being blind, I am constrained to tell what I thought to have concealed. I am Plutus the rich God of wealth: my fa|ther was Pinch-back True-penny, the rich Usurer of Islington; my mother, Mrs. Silver|side, an Aldermans widow: I was born in Golden-Lane, christened at the Mint in the Tower; Banks the Conjurer, and old Hobson the Carrier were my godfathers.


Car.
As sure as can be, this Plutus God of wealth is a pure Welsh-man, born with his pedigree in his mouth, he speaks it so natu|rally. I'le lay my life he was begt and bred in the Silver-mine that Middleton found in Wales.


Chr.
Thou hadst bin a very Rascal, if thou

had'st not told us thy name had been Plutus the God of wealth.


Car.
God of wealth! art thou he? O let me kisse thy silver-Jolls!


Chr.
Thou art welcome to me too. But art thou Plutus God of wealth, and so mise|rably arrayed! O Phoebus, Apollo, O gods and devils, and Iupiter to boot! Art thou Plutus the rich sonne and heire to Pinch|back True-penny!


Plu.
I am he my self.


Car.
But art thou sure that thou thy self art thy self? art thou he?


Plu.
I am the self-same Plutus Rich, the self-same sonne and heire to the self-same Pinch-back True-penny: marry till my eyes are open, I shall never be heire apparent.


Chr.
I, but how camest thou so miserable nasty?


Plu.
Forth from Patrochus den, from Hell at Westminster; conversing with some Black ones there, whose faces since their baptisme hath not been washed.


Chr.
And why goest thou so lamentably poor?


Plu.
Iupiter envying the good of mise|rable mortals, put me poor soul into these dismal dumps.


Chr.
Upon what occasion, pray thee.


Plu.

Jle tell you,
In the minority of my youthful dayes
J took a humour, an ingenious humour,
To flee the company of Rogues and Raseals,
And unto honest men betake my self.
Iupiter spying this (meer out of envy)
Put out my eye-sight, that J might not know
Knaves from the honest, but to them might go.



Chr.

Was this from Iove? why none but honest men,
Honour his deity.



Plu.

Why what of that? this heathen god accepts
As well the Pilgrim-salve of wicked men,
As the religious incense of the honest.
Thus does the Letcherous god, that hath al|ready
Cuckoldiz'd half the world, and plac'd his bastards
By mortals fires, envy vertuous minds.



Chr.

To leave off versifying, if thou had'st thy eye-sight,
VVould'st thou be true to flie from vicious persons?



Plut.
I I protest I would.


Chr.

And wholly employ thy eyes to pious uses.
To go to'th' company of honest and ingenu|ous souls.



Plut.
Onely to them; for I have not seen so much as one of them this many a day.


Car.
VVhy, what if you have not, you blinde Puppy-dog? VVhat a wonder's that? VVhy, I that have as good Eyes as any man i'th' company, can hardly finde many: They have more wit now a dayes then go abroad openly. Vertue by that means would become too cheap and common. I remember, J saw one once, but he died young for grief, that he had not wit enough to be a Knave; eve|ry one laught at him for being out of Fashion. Had he lived till now, J would h'showed him at Fleet-bridge for a Monster. J should have begger'd the Beginnning 'oth' World; The strange Birds from America, and the Pop|pets too. J would have blown a Trumpet Ta|rantara, If any man or woman in Town or City be affected with strange miracles, let them repair bither. Here within this place is to be seen a strange Monster; A man that hath both his Ears, and but one Tongue; that cannot carry two Faces under one hood; that has but one couple of Hands, and on each Hand five honest Fingers. And what is more strange, he has but one Heart; who dares, as if he were none of Adams Posterity, be ho|nest at this time 'oth' year; and will give e|very man his due in spight of his teeth.
Js not this as rare as a Blazing Star to look on?


Plut.
VVell, now you have heard all; pray give me leave to be gone.


Chre.
Not so by Iove; for now we have a greater desire to stay you then ever.


Plut.
I told you so, I thought you would be troublesome.


Chr.
Nay, I beseech you leave us not now for though you should take Diogenes his Lan|thorn

and Candle and search from Noon to Night, you could not finde an honester man from the Tropick of Cancer to Capricorn.


Car.
Sir, I will swear and be depos'd for my Master he is as arrant a Cancer as any Capricorn in Christendom.


Plut.
I know they all promise fair, but when they have once got me, they lay aside their thred-bare honesty; as if being grown rich, it were a disparagement to be vertuous any longer.


Car.
Yet all men are not knaves.


Plut.
Yes most, if not all, by Iove.


Car.
Pray Sir, though you put my Master in, let me me be excepted. Body of me, call me knave in a crowd! If I be not reveng'd, and that soundlyYou were best take heed of your general Rules. Could not you have said (you blind Bussard) for ought I can see you may be one among the rest; but to speak it so peremptorily?


Chr.
Nay, if you but knew what you should gain by staying! Mark me, I can cure thee of thy blindnesse: I can do as great mi|racles as Enston waters.


Plut.
Truly, as blinde as I am, I can see when I am well. Have my eysight restored? I hope, I shall never live to see that day.


Chr.
VVhat sayes the man?


Car.
He has a natural desire to be wret|ched, To play at blindman-buff all his life time. Good Mole, what dost thon above ground?


Plut.
No, no, if Iupiter did but know of this project, he would powder me into a pret|ty pickle.


Chr.
Heare me man, he cannot sowse thee worse then he has already, to make thee run stumbling o're the world: I warrant, thy shins have cursed him a thousand times.


Plut.
I know not that, but me thinks my buttocks begin to quake with very thought of him.


Chr.
I think so; but what the Devil makes thee so timerous? I know if thou shouldest but recover thy ey-sight, thou wouldest not value Iupiters command at three half pence, but break winde in his face to counter-thunder him.


Plut.
Nay, do not tell me so good VVick|ednesse.


Chr.
Have but patience, and I will plainly demonstrate that thy Command is greater then any Nubicog Iupiters.


Plu.
VVhose? mine? Am I such a man, so powerfull?


Chr.
I tho, if thou hadst but wit and eyes enough to see it; for first, I ask you what does Iupiter reign by?


Plut.
VVhy, by that which he rained in|to Dana's lap, a showre of silver.


Chr.
And who lent him that silver?


Car.
VVhy, who but Plutus; and yet the beggerly Iove payes him no Use nor Princi|pal: VVell Iupiter, we shall have Plutus lodge you in Ludgate shortly, to take up your Shop, and make your thunder-bolts there, and cry lamentably, For the Lords sake, Bread, Bread for the poore Prisoners; unlesse you can morgage the golden or silver Age to give better security to your Creditour.


Chr.
Ask, why do men sacrifice to Iove, if not for Silver?


Car.
By heaven, for Silver. No penny, no Pate-noster, quoth the Pope. Does good|man Iupiter think we'll pray, to wear out our Stockings at knees for nothing?

No, of all prayers, this is the result,
Iove make me rich, or pray quicunque vult.



Chr.
Is not Plutus then the Author of grand sacrifices? where would the Directory lie, if it were not for the new Act of the Priests maintenance? Nay, if we were to sa|crifice a Bull or Ram, do you think the But|cher would give it to the god for nothing? No, no, if Plutus should not purchase devo|tion with his coyn, the Olympian Kitchin would smel of nothing but Lent and Fasting|dayes all the year after.


Plut.
VVhy, I pray, may I put Iupiter out of Commons when I please?


Chr.
May you? I marry may you. Doest not thou maintain him? He lves at thy charges. Iupiter had not best anger thee, lest thou take an opinion and starve him.


Plut.
Say you so? Is it by my courtesie they sacrifice to Iove?



Chr.
Yes, altogether; for whom is he ho|nored by?


Plut.
By reverend Priests.


Chr.
And dost thou think the Levitical men would not disband, if there were want of pay or Tithes? It is most certain, money is the Catholick Empresse of the world, her com|mands are obey'd from Spain to the Indies.


Car.
'Tis true Master, had I been rich (But I curse my Stars, I was born under the three-penny Planet, never to be worth a groat) I should have scorn'd the degree of Sword and Buckler; but now for a little sil|ver and a thred-bare Livery, I have sold the Fee-simple of my self and my liberty, to any worshipfull peece of folly that will undertake me.


Chr.
I have heard your Gentilizians, your dainty Curtezana's, in plain English, your arrant VVhores of Venice, such as are ready stew'd for any mans appetite: if a poor man desire to sin a little, they presently sit crosse-leg'd; but if a rich man tempt them, at the sound of his Silver they cannot hold their water. VVhy, the VVhores of Pict|hatch, Turnbull, or the unmercifull Bawds of Bloomsbury, under the degree of Plutus, will not let a man be acquainted with the sins of the Suburbs. The Pox is not so cheap as to be given gratis: The unconscionable Queans have not so much charity left as to let you damn your selves for nothing.


Car.
'Tis very true that my Master tels you: For Plutach reports in the life and death of Besse Bronbton, that she never un|button'd to any of the guard for nothing.


Chr.
But you may think this is spoken on|ly of bad men, such as have prostituted their souls to the world; As for good Roundthey desire not money, no good souls not they.


Car.
VVhat then J pray?


Chr.
VVhy, this wishes for a good Troo|ping horse; that, for a fleet pack of Hounds.


Car.
J, when they are ashamed to ask mo|ney in plain terms, they vail their avarice under some such mask or other: but he that wishes for a Horse, makes silver the intent of his journey; and they that beg for Hounds, 'tis money they hunt for.


Chr.
All Arts and Crafes 'mongst men were by thee invented. I, and the seven Sci|ences (but for thee) they could never have been so liberal.


Plut.
O horse that I was, never to know my own strength till now!


Chr.
'Tis this that makes great Philip of Spain so proud.


Car.
VVithout thee (Plutus) the Law|yer would not go to London on any Terms.


Chr.
All the Generals, Hopton and Mon|tross, are by thee maintained: 'Troth, all the Troopers or Foot-men without thee would never be contented with free-quarter onely, there must come Taxes, Contributions and Excise to boot.

Did not Will Summers break his wind for thee?
And Shakespeare therefore writ his Co|medy?
All things acknowledge thy vast power di|vine,
(Great God of Money) whose most power|full shine
Gives motion, life; Day rises from thy sight.
Thy setting, though at noon, makes night.
Sole catholick cause of what we feel or see,
All in this All are but th' effects of thee.



Plut.
O heavens! can I do all these things you talk of? Ill tide this wretched blinde|nesse of mine, that would never let me see what Command or Power I had: All the world for a pair of Eys and a Looking-glasse! Sure now the Delphian gate and J have good wits: for we jumpt together in this opinion, that it is an excellent thing for a man to know himself: J shall love a Nosce teipsum as long as J live for this trick. Can J doe all these things?


Chr.
All these? J by heaven canst thou, and millions more then these. VVhy there was never any man weary of thy company (O god of wealth) Thou art a welcome guest where ere thou comest. There is plenty of all things: Plenty of Love.


Car.
And pienty of VVhite-bread and Butter.


Chr.
Plenty of Honour.


Car.
And plenty of Cheese-cakes.


Chr.
Plenty of Friends.



Car.
And plenty of Bag-puddings.


Chr.
Plenty of Servants.


Car.
And plenty of Furmenty.


Chr.
Plenty of Health.


Car.
And plenty of Custards.


Chr.
Plenty of Command.


Car.
And plenty of Pease-porredge.


Chr.
Never any man has enough of thee. If he can change a Groat, yet he despairs of a Bed till he can get a Tester. Then he pro|cures a full Jury of pence to be empannell'd for the finding out of a Shilling. That done, the ambitious Niggard will fain usurp a Crown, which must be made a Noble one: And that is never safe, till it have a good Angel to guard it. All this obtain'd, he can|not without a Mark be reckoned a man of notice: Nor has he a patch of a Gentleman, till he be worth a Peece.


Car.
The good old Gentleman thinks he has jested all thiswhile handsome grave gray|pated quiblets. Good heaven, what pretty things these wits are, when they are out of date!


Chr.
When the Purse is full, the Pouch gapes; and when the Pouch hath his belly|full, the great Chest yawns-wide enough to swallow  dies, and Goldsmiths-Hall, and the Devil to boot; and yet when all is done, they think themselves as poor as Ius, if their estates do not out-value Doomsday|book.


Plut.
You say true, Sir: yet methinks I am afraid of one thing.


Chr.
VVhat is that?


Plut.
That I shall never attain to that utopia you speak of, 'tis a country so hard to conquor; Castles in the aire are very im|pregnable.


Chr.
Sir, upon my word, let not that trou|ble you: Do your endeavour, and i'le war|rant you shall see as perfectly as any Lynceus in Christendome.


Plu.
Then Lynceus! what was he?


Chr.
One that could see the very motes in the sun, and the least things in the world.


Plu.
I can see the least in the world al|ready, I thank you for nothing: I can see lesse then any Lynceus living. But how canst thou, poor mortal worm, take off the seque|stration of my eye-sight, and restore me to perfect seeing again?


Chr.

Do not doubt it; For thy delinquent Eyes
Shall be admitted to compound, and see most perfectly.
Be of good hope: the Delphian god hath sworne,
And therewithall brandish'd his Pythian Lawrel,
That Plutus should out-look the starres to blindnesse.



Plut.
Ha, ha, ha! How does he know so much? I never was acquainted with that same Apollo in my life. I remember I have been foxt at his Oracle at Temple-bar. I am afraid this Apollo is one of your fellow-Juglers.


Chr.
Cannot a man perswade you? have not I said it?


Plut.
VVell then, do you look to it.


Car.
So we had need, for you cannot your self.


Chr.
Take you no care, I will do it though I die to morrow before breakfast.


Car.
Marry and that were a miserable thing to go to the grave upon a fasting sto|mack. Pray master, when you take in hand the cure of Plutus his eyes, let poor Cayon have a finger in it.


Chr.
A finger in it! That were the way to put out his eyes.


Car.
'Tis strange, master, you should have no more understanding: my meaning was, you would accept of my help, (good Mr. Chremylus.)


Chr.
VVell sirrah, we will; and some o|ther fellow-partners too, some of our plun|dered neighbours that are enjoyned for pe|nance to fast four dayes a week, for having surfeited on too much honesty.


Plu.
Marry heaven forbid, I shall be ill holp up with such miserable helpers as they: the hungry Rascals will go neer to devoure me quick like Irish canibals. No, let me be blind still, that my eyes may never be con|scious to the plundring of my flesh  bones in peeces. 'Twere a miserable spectacle for them to begin with.



Chr.
I warrant, you need not fear that: if they once grow rich, they'll rather feed on Rost-beef and Marrow-bone pyes, like Com|mittee men, then cosen the worms of so lean a carcasse. Sirra Carion, where be your cou|ple of Footmen?


Car.
Here master, what should I do?


Chr.
Run and call my honest poor neigh|bours, you shall find the miserable drudges tugging at the Plough-taile for their Land|lords. No, now I think on't, the Excise-men came to day and fetcht them away for contri|bution. Go to them, you know the way to the Office neer Cuckolds-Pound, London. Tell them in their eares, that we have Plutus at home, and will share him amongst us: we'll divide him into severall messes, and each man take his part by seniority. But stay, do you heare: beware of Knaves, and of Veale.


Car.
Veale it seems is not so good. But what shall I do with this Leg of Mutton here? I dare not venture the safety of it amongst 'um; the villains carry dangerous teeth a|bout 'um.


Chr.
Wee'll take care for that: meet me at home two houres hence.

Exit Chr.

Car.
O what a plot are we going about! I could laugh for joy.

Now may I forsake my dump,
And bestir my hob-nail'd stump,
Skip about and risk and jump:
Honest men are turn'd up trump,
I shall find them in a lump,
But every Knaue must have a Thump.

 what a plot is this, to blow up all the knaves in a kingdom together, nay in all the world, put in Turks, Jewes, Pagans and Jnfidels! Why, Catesby and Percy were punies. Garnet and Digby and Faux, if they had gone about such an honest Gun-powder treason as this, they had never had their heads upon poles a Daw-catching over the Parliament-House. Well, they were hang'd for knaves and fools; but we shall thrive, and be wise and worship|ful, and honest too, for Carion's a man in the plot.

This is a stratagem was never such,
That honest men alone now should be rich.
That honest men should thrive by right, not wrong.
London, take heed; for thoul't be poor re long.


Exit Carion.


Act. 1. Scaen. 3.
Enter Scrape-all a Farmer, and Dull-pate his sonne.

Scrap.

J live at Islington, and J have heard
Plutus is come to Westminster: Sure, sure,
He'd take it ill if J forbeare to visit him,
He knows J am his kinsman:
For J was kin to Pinch-back True-penny
His Father, who did live at Islington,
An Usurer almost next door to me.
Most opportunely here he comes, J see.
God save you sir! your poor kinsman salutes you.



Plut.
Who's this? my eye-sight fails me; what's your name?


Scrap.
Scrape-all your kinsman, lives at Islington


Plut.

O J remember; are you honest now?
J have a humour to love honest men.



Scrap.

The Country thinks so, J'm con|verted lately:
Dull-pate my son is also here come with me:



Plut.
Of what profession is he?


Scrap.
A Parson verily.


Plut.
What would he have?


Scrap.

A Benefice, two or three,
An't like your VVorship.
He's a true Scrape-all, of the Scrapealls blood;
True Dull-pate Scrape-all, He hath past the Synod.



Plut.

O, has he so! J thought to have sent him thither.
J have few Livings left now to bestow.
My golden Prebends which J had at Pauls,
You know are sunk ith dust: For other places
The best the Synod has 'um. Yet your sonne
Dulpate, J know he cannot want preferment,
He looks so learnedly, and goes in black too.
He may change habits, 'tis allow'd of now
As the world goes. Is he not a Tradesman?
He'd thrive the better, if he can snuffle handsomly.
Was he ever train'd up at the Universities?



Scrap.
Yes out of both; that is, never of either.


Plut.

However he will be rich. Let him leap over
The Steeple-houses, and teach in private;
His vails will be the fatter: Tythes and Cures
He must preach down as Antichristian,
And take as much as both. He has an excel|lent name,
A thriving name! I think you said 'twas Dulpate.



Scrap.
Yes Sir. Now thank your Patron, and be gone.


Dulp.
Thankatus  Godamericatus ve|ster dignitas.

Exit Dulp.

Scrap.
He gives your Worship thanks and god-a-mercy.


Plut.

I have no skill in Physiognomie:
But sure thou wilt be rich, Dulpate,  wealthy.



Scrap.

Unkle, we thank you: will it please you know
The entertainment of ou poor cottage?



Plut.

No, it is against the complexion of my humour
To visit any mans house: I never got
Any commodity by it in my life.
For if I chance to light into the clutches
Of some vile Usure, he buries me
Quick under ground, or keeps me prisoner closely
In his old Chests, where without sheets I lie,
But his Indenturs keep me company.
And if J fall into the prodigal hands
Of some mad roaring Tytire tu, he spends me
Upon his lecherous Cocatrice; or playing
Throws me away at passage: So am J turn'd
Stark naked out of doors, with not so much
As a poor Purse to make a Night-cap of.



Scrap.

Jt seems you never met with mo|derate men.
But this is my disposition: when oceasion
Serveth, no man more liberal: when oppor|tunity
Jnvites, no man more thristy.
Come, let's go in. O how my wife shall joy
At sight of thee, asmuch as for a French Hood
Or Taffata Kirtle! Thou art my best be|loved.



Plut.
J easily believe it.


Scrap.

Who would not tell thee
The truth of things, J wish that he were louzy
(Sweet rogue) at Beggers-bush, or else confin'd
To the perpetual regiment of Bridewell.
Come my dear Unkle, come! O how J love
The silver-hairs of thy most delicate chin!
Though J be rich by wickednesse and sin.

Finis Actus primi.


Act. 2.

Scaen. 1.
Enter Carion, Clodpole, Lackland and Stiffe, 3 Rusticks.

Car.
Come along you old Hobnails. J'le have your horses shod with gold of Ophir or Peru Ha, you old Muck-worms! J'le make your Hog-trough paunches so fat, that the leanest of you all shall out-weigh the Arch|bishop of Spalato. What an Esopical roar|ing Lion am J, to lead this army of Asses into the field! Come, my masters, old friends, you that have eat many a bushel of salt, J would say garlick in his coompany Make haste you Plough-lacquies, Boots his kinsmen. You neighbour Lackland, set the best foot forward. And you goodman Clodpole, old Snaile with a slimy nose, if you make not haste, they will have done scrambling ere we come.


Clod.
Now by the rood of my Granam's soul, J'ch go as vast as my leggs will beare me. What would you have of an old man, that's grown crazy?


Car.
Crazy!


Clod.
J, crazy. Do you think a man that has one voot in the grave can trudge as vast as zuch a young knave as thou? When J was a stripling of thy age, J could have trickt it ivaith, Mr. Ficar knowes, with the best of the Parish.


Lackl.
Neighbour, neighbour, J'le tell

you what I do devise you now, this is my pinion.


Car.
Your pinion, you goose? and what is your pinion?


Lackl.
Marry this is my pinion now: This saucy knave may do it to uflout us. 'Tis best o command of him what is his masters con|tention in ending vor us now la.


Car.
Why have not I told you? My ma|ster zends for you to change this nasty con|dition of yours into some delicate happinesse. You shall be rich, you Rogues, all of you Justices of Peaces, Lords, Emperors, or what is more, High-Constables.


Clodp.
Very well said. But I will be none of his Peaces nor Lords; let me be a High-Constable. I will have a new vaile as zoon as I come to my honours, and thou shalt be next to exzeed me in my house-of-Office.


Lackl.
I, but neighbours, how shall this be defected? Let him dissolve us of that now, it seems not possetible, so it does not.


Car.
Why you Villiago's, my master has brought home an old lame, rotten, mangy, toothlesse, saplesse, bald-pate, rusty musty crusty fusty dusty old Dotard, just such an|other as my neighbour Stiffe or Lackland, or you Clodpole with a slimy nose, with a great bunch-back.


Lackl.
A bunch-back! Nay then thou art a meszenger of gold. Hah neighbours, that was not a bunch-back, I warrant you la, they were huge bags of gold. That's another pini|on of mine, neighbours, what do you jecture in that?


Car.
You jecture like an asse: That bunch at his back was but a natural budget of old mischiefs.


Lackl.
Do not think to play the Jack|anapes with me for nothing. Have I not here a good cudgel? if thou do, thou shalt be clap|per-de-claw'd.


Car.
I wonder what you take me for: what dishonesty did you ever know by me?


Clodp.
Dishonesty, zay you! None, not we. 'Tis a very honest Monky: Yet I have zeen him, neighbours, zit in Bridewell, when the loving vetters have been close friends to his legs.


Car.
Very true; at the same time you were one of the Justices of hell, Radamanthus had newly resigned his office to you.


Clodp.
Now the murrain founder thee, thou parlous wag, thus to 'buse thy betters! Sirra, look you deveal unto us why your ma|ster hath vited s from our natural poccu|pations.


Car.
Prick up your ears then, and I will tell you. My master hath brought home Plutus to enrich you all. Thou shalt be Maior of the City; canst not thou sleep on the Bench? Thou shalt be Baily; hast not thou wit enough to tell clocks? And all the rest of your frozen-bearded Neighbours, understanding Aldermen.


Lackl.
Nay zo they be Aldermen, 'tis no matter vor Understanding: 'tis a beggerly quality vit for none but poor Schollers and Losophers. But has thy master got Plutus, and shall we all be rich in good zooth, Carion?


Car.
I in zooth neighbour Lackland, as rich as Midas, if you had but asses ears.


Lackl.
Nay, vor if that be all, I shall do well enough I warrant you, mine are of a pretty length already: it does me good at the heart neighbours, zo it does.


Stiffe.
Vaith would Mr. Olip-latine our Ficar were here too. He's an honest man, he reads Common-prayer we can vollow him and understand him; He will not med|dle with Diricks-stories nor Extrumperies. He has but poor twanty Nobles a year, think of it Neighbours.


Clodp.
Vaith and thou saiest right neigh|bour Stiffe, and he gives us good destructions once a moneth, as good as a Nomine.


Lackl.
I, and I like him: He's none of the Hum-drums, he'll clap it up quickly, e|specially if there be a match at the Alehouse,


Clodp.
Masse, and he'll drink Sack and Claret as fast as any Synod man.


Stiff.
I, neighbours, and he's none of them that be proud; he will not scorn to drink with his poor neighbours too: if Plutus would give him twice twanty Nobles, I would not think it too much.


Lackl.
I warrant, our Propriator would

hang himself voe he would allow it.


Clodp.
Tis no matter, we'll tition Plutus our selves vor him.


Stiff.
Nay neighbours, and lets tell him he'll cursten and bury after the old way. I warrant, when Mr. Clip-latin's gone, we shall never have such a man again to fit the parish. Every one loves him, but Never-good the Sequestrator, that


Lackl.
When Plutus comes, we'll think of him. Vaith neighbours, shall we be rich? What will my neighbour Rem-all do? He'll get him a Satten-doublet, and scorn his proud Landlord: And Steal-all the Tailor, and Noyse the Ballad-singer will ride about in Coaches, and all the rest of um too.
Vaith, shall we have Plutus! shall we be rich! I shall e'en throw away my leather|slops  my pitchforks. O it joyces my heart! Neighbours, it is as good news as a pot of ale and a tost in a vrosty morning.


Stiff.
I could give a penny for a May-pole to dance the morris vor arrant joy. Shall we be rich ivaith!


Car.

Now will I with the Cyclops sing,
Threttanelo, Threttanelo.
Which Polyphemus earst did ring,
To the tune of Fortune my foe.



Chor.

Threttanelo, Threttanelo:
And sing we all merrily, Threttanelo, Thret|tanelo.



Car.
Bleat you like Ewes the while.


Chor.
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.


Car.
Like frisking Kids full merrily go, Threttanelo, Threttanelo.


Cho.
And sing we all


Car.
Dance out your coats like lecherous goats, Threttanelo, Threttanelo!


Cho.
And sing we all


Car.

Let us this Cyclops seek:
To the place where he sleeps let us go, Threttanelo.



Car.

Put out as he lies
With a Cowl-staffe his eyes, Threttanelo.



Cho.

And sing we all merrily,
And sing we all



Car.

But now you shall see
I Circe will be,
And turn you to hogs ere I go, Threttanelo.
Go grunt you all now
Like your mother the Sow, Threttanelo.



Cho.

And sing we all
And sing we all



Car.
But come you Pig-hogs, let us leave jesting. I restore you to your old Metamor|phosis, as you may see in the first leaf of Vir|gils Bucolicks. I will go the next way to the Cup-board, and fill my guts like an Emperor. And then if you have any thing to maund me on a full stomack, you may ply me in what you please.

Musick. Exeunt omnes.


Act. 2. Scaen. 2.
Enter Chremylus and Stiffe, Clodpole, Lackland.

Chre.
Honest neighbours, welcome: I will not bid you good morrow now. That was my salutation in the dayes of poverty: that stink|ing complement never fitted my mouth, but when my breath smelt of onions and garlick. Gramercy old blades, for coming. Let me hug you. Oh what a sweet armful of friends is here! If you be but valiant now, and de|fend Plutus, the least of you all shall have wealth enough to confront Prester-Iohn, and the Grand Signior too.


Clod.
Jf that be all, my life for yours. Vali|ant! Why Mars himself was an arrnt coward to me; I have beat him at voot-ball above twenty times. Jf you did but zee me once, J warrant you would call me goodman Hector as long as I lived for't. Did you not zee how J cuffe with Hercules for a two-peny loaf last Curmasse? Let Plutus go! No, let me re|turn again to Onyons and Pease-porredge then, and never be acquainted with the hap|pinesse of a Surloyn of rost-beef.


Chre.
Well neighbours, march in. J see Blepsidemus coming toward. He has heard of my good fortune, that makes him foot it so fast. Jn the dayes of my poverty all my friends went on crutches; they would come to me as fast as black Snails: but now they can out|run Dromedaries. This 'tis to be rich and

Now I have a rich Load-stone lyeth under my Threshold that draws in all their Iron Spurs.

He that will have his friends about him tuck,
Must have th' alluring bait of golden muck.


Ex. omnes.


Act. 2. Scaen. 3.
Enter Blepsidemus, Chremylus.

Blepsid.

VVhat should this be? or by what means? 'tis strange
That my friend Cremylus is grown so rich;
I scarce belive't, because I know him honest,
Yet every Barbers shop reports it boldly.
'Tis very strange he should grow rich 'oth' sudden.
And then 'tis stranger far, that being grown wealthy,
He cals his poor friends to be part'ners with him;
I am sure, 'tis not the courtesie of England.



Chr.
Friend Blepsidemus, welcome; I am not the same beggerly Chremylus I was yesterday. Be merry, true-blew, be merry; thou art one of my friends too, I'le put you all into a hu|mor of thriving.


Blep.
Are you so wealthy sir, as report speaks?


Chr.

So wealthy? ha, soft and fair. Cozen
Blepsidemus, J shall be anon:
Things of great consequence have some dan|ger in them.



Blep.
Danger? VVhat danger?


Chr.
VVhy, J'le tell thee all. Jf we bring this busines to passe, we shall be brave blades, Be drunk with Sack and Claret every day; glutted with roast Beef, Pasties and Marry|bone-pies: but if our hopes be frustrate, we are undone, we must to Leeks and Onions again.


Blep.

All is not right, J fear, J do not like it,
Thus suddenly to thrive, and thus to fear;
Makes me suspect my judgement and his honesty.



Chr.
VVhat honesty?


Blep.

Jf those your sacrilegious hands have plundered
Apollo's Temple, and enrich't your Coffers
VVith Gold and Silver, ravish't from the Altars.
Jf you repent, yet do not mock your friends:
Perchance, you have invited all your neigh|bours
To hear you make a learned Consession;
To shake hands from the Ladder, and take leave
Of their dear Chremylus at the fatal Tree:
No, you shall pardon me, me not in the hu|mour,
To take a walk toward Paddington to day.



Chr.
Marry heavens forbid! there's no such cause nor matter.


Blep.
Nay, trifle now no longer: 'tis too manifest.


Chr.
You do me wrong, thus to suspect a friend.


Blep.

'Fore Iove, J think there's not an honest man,
But drossie earthy muck-worm-minded Vas|sals,
And these full soon morgage their Souls for Silver:
Iove's image for the States



Chr.
By heaven I think thou art mad. Do thy naked brains want clothing, Blepsidemus? for J see thy wit is gone a wool-gathering.


Blep.

J see Chremylus is not Chremylus, for me thinks
VVho hath lost his honesty hath lost himself.



Blep.
As sure as can be, some gib'd Cat that died issuelesse, has adopted thee for her Heire, and bequeathed the legacy of her me|lancholy to thee. Jt is impossible thou should'st be so mad else.


Blep.

Thy countenance so oft changing, and thy eyes
Unconstant gogling, call thee guilty Chre|mylus,
Of a dishonest jugling soul.



Chr.
Nay, good Raven, do not croak so. J know what your croaking tends to. Now if J had stoln any thing, you and the Devill would have put in for a share.


Blep.
Do I do this to claim my share, what share



Chr.
Come there is no such matter my fin|gers have not learn'd the sleight of hand. Picking and stealing is none of their profes|sion.


Blep.

O 'tis some learned distinction; VVhat, you'l say
You did not steal, you did but take't away;
VVell, 'tis not good to equivocate with a Halter,
Gregory is a cunning Disputant:
An argument of Hemp is hardly answered.



Chr.
VVhat melancholy Devil has possest thee? J am sure it is no merry one. This madnesse doth not smel of Edmonton.


Blep.
VVhom have you plunder'd then? whose Bung is nipt.


Chr.
No mans.


Blep.

O Hercules! VVhose tongue speaks truth?
In what cold Zone dwels naked honesty?



Chr.
I see, friend, you condemn me 're you know the truth.


Blep.

Come, do not jest your neck into the Noose,
Tell me betimes, that with the Key of Gold
I may lock up the Vermin's mouth. Infor|mers
Are dangerous cattle, if they once but yawn;
As bad as Sequestrators, but l'se undertake.



Chr.
I will not have you undertake any thing for me; you will be at too much charges: Sir, my intent is to enrich all ho|nest men.


Blep.
Why, have you stoln so much?


Chr.
No faith, a little will serve the turn, there are so few of them. But sirra, know J have Plutus himself at home.


Blep.
VVho, Plutus? God of wealth.


Chr.
The same, by heaven and hell.


Blep.
VVhat, heaven and hell by Westmin|ster-hall, where Lawyers and Parliament men eat French-broth? Have you Plutus, by Vesta?


Chr.
Yes and by Neptune too.


Blep.
VVhat Neptune? Neptune of the Sea?


Chr.
By Neptune of the Sea, or any other Neptune in Europe. He is the smal-legd Gentleman-Ushers god; for his Chariot is drawn with Calves.


Blep.
VVhy do you not send him about a|mong your friends?


Chr.
What, before he have recovered his ey-sight?


Blep.
Why, is Plutus blinde?


Chr.
By Iove is he.


Blep.
Nay, J did alwayes think so; and that's the reason he could never finde the way to my house.


Chr.
But now he shall at a short-hand.


Blep.
VVhat, Brachygraphy? Thomas Shel|tons Art?


Chr.
No, I mean suddenly.


Blep.
He shall be welcome: But why do you not get some skilfull Oculist for him? Have you never a Chyrurgion about the town that hath Eyes to sell of his own making?


Chr.
Now the Spittle-house on the Puck|fist tribe of them. If a man have but a cut Finger, the Cure of it shall be as long as the Siege of Breda: Physitians and Surgeons are good for nothing but to fill Graves and Hos|pitals.


Blep.
Sure then, that's the reason none but Sextons pray for them.


Chr.
No, i'le have a better device; he shall go to the Temple of Esculapius.


Blep.
Come let us make haste, To be rich as soon as we can. Dives qui fieri vult, Et cito vult fieri


Chr.
VVe will get a Fieri facias of the Lawyers. They pick all the wealth out of the Country-mens pockets. Have but pati|ence, J will warrant thee as Rich as any Al|derman.

Offer to Ex.


Act 2. Scaen. 4.
Enter Penia and meets them.

Pen.
Must J needs meet you, you old Do|tards? Are you not ashamed of your gray Coxcombes? you are going about a fine piece of impudence, to undoe me and all my children. But J shall plague you for it.


Cir.
Now Hercules and his club defend me!


Pen.
J le cut your throats, and slit your impudent gurgulio's, you Calves at three|score: How dare you undertake such confe|deracy? but you shall throttle for't, by all

the ash-colour'd cattle about me.


Blep.
What creature is this with the Red|oker face? She looks as if she were begot by Marking-stones.


Chr.
By stones sure: tis some Eynnis that is broke loose from the Tragedy.


Blep.
By Ieronymo, her looks are as terri|ble as Don Andraea, or the Ghost in Hamlet.


Chr.
Nay, 'tis rather one of Belzebub's Heralds.


Blep.
Why so?


Chr.
VVhy, doest thou not see how many several Coats are quartered in her Arms?


Pen.
So, so; and who do you think I am?


Blep.
Some Bawd of Shoreditch, or Turn|bul Broker of Maidenheads, c.


Chr.
VVhy woman, why dost thou follow us? we have done thee no wrong.


Pen.
No, good honest Scavengers, no wrong! By the skin betwixt my eye-browes, but Ile make you know 'tis a wrong. Is it no wrong to cast me out of every place, and leave me no where to be in?


Chr.
Yes, thou shalt have the liberty of Hell, and all good kindnesses the honest Devils can do thee, for my sake. But what art thou? why dost not thou tell us who thou art?


Pen.
One that will be soundly revenged on you all, for committing more then gun|powder treason against a poor woman, that hath not so much as a tooth in her head that means you any harm.


Blep.
VVe will not trust so much as thy gums for all that. VVho art thou?


Pen.
I am Poverty, Penia Poverty, eldest daughter of Asotus Spend-all, of Brecknock|shire; One that hath kept house with you this thirty years and upwards; I have sate winter and summer at your Great-grandfathers table.


Blep.
O Apollo and the rest of the Spittle|house gods! tell me how I may run away.


Chr.
Nay, stay you cowardly drone.


Blep.
Stay! no not for the world, I will not keep Poverty company; there be vormine about her which I would be loth should cosen the worms of my carkasse.


Pen.
Dare you grunt, you unethical Ru|sticks, being taken in the fact?


Chr.
Stay Coward, shall two men run a|way from one woman?


Blep.
One woman! I, but 'tis Poverty; Penia Poverty, or Penia Pennylesse.
No Tyger so cruel: I had rather fight with Mall Cutpurse and my Lady Sands both to|gether at quarter-staffe.


Chr.
Good Blepsidemus stay.


Blep.
Good Chremylus run away.


Chr.
Shall we leave Plutus thus?


Blep.
How shall we resist this warlike Amazon, the valiantest of all Tinkers truls and doxies! She has made me pawn my Bilbo-blade and rusty Head-piece at the Alchouse many a time in arrant policy. Let us run; there is no hope of safety but in foot|manship. Our valour is clean contrary to Achilles, for our greatest security lies in our heels. Let us run: Stone-walls are not defence enough, her hunger will break through and devoure us.


Chr.
Take thy Porredge-pot (man) for a Helmet, thy Ladle for a Spear, and a Sword of Bacon, and thou art arm'd against Poverty cap-a-pe: And then Plutus shall come and cut her throat, and raise a trophy out of her miserable carkasse.


Pen.
Dae you snarl, you Currs, after the contriving such damnable injury?


Blep.
What injury, you old Beldame! We have not ravisht thee, I am sure; thy beauty is not so much moving. Doest think we mean to lie with Red-Oker! to commit fornica|tion with a Red-Lattice! I know not what thy lower parts can do; but thy very Fore|head is able to burn us. Let thy Salamander-Nose and Lips live in perpetual flames, for me; Iove send thee everlasting fire! There is no Cupid in thy complexion: a man may look upon thee, without giving the flesh oc|casion to tempt the spirit: i all were made of the same clay thou art, Adultery would be a stranger in England.


Pen.
O immortal gods, is it no injury to restore Plutus to his eye-sight! Now Furis put our all your eyes, and then consume all the dogs in Christendome, that there may be none to lead you!



Chr.
What harm is it to you, if we study the catholike good of all mankind?


Pen.
What catholike good of mankind? I'm sure the Roman catholike religion com|mands wilfull poverty.


Blep.
That is because Plutus is blind: his blindnesse is the cause of that devotion. But when Plutus can see again, we will kick you out of the Universe, and leave you no place but the Universities: marty those you may claim by custome, 'tis your pennylesse bench; we give you leave to converse with sleeveless Gowns and thred-bare Cassocks.


Pen.
But what if J perswade you its ne|cessary that Poverty live amongst you?


Blep.
Perswaded! we will not be perswa|ded; for we are perswaded not to be per|swaded, though we be perswaded. Thus we are perswaded; and we will not be perswa|ded to perswade our selves to the contrary, any wayes being perswaded.


Pen.
If J do not, do what you will with me; leave me no place to rest in, but the empty Study of that pittiful Poet, that hath botcht up this poor Comedy with so many patches of his ragged wit, as if he meant to make Poverty  Coat of it.


Blep.
 Tupana, kai Cophona  Jack Dolophin and his Kettle-drum defend us.


Cor.
But if you be convicted and non|plust, what punishment will you submit your self unto?


Pen.
To any.


Blep.
Ten deaths: other Cats have but nine, Gramlkin her self. Let us be sure Po|very die outright, I begin to be bowsie in he company Let's march.

Exeunt ambo.

Pen.
Yet I thank Iove I am better ac|quainted in City and Country, then these think of. In the City many that go in gay|clothes know me; in the Country I am known for Taxes, Excise and Contributions: besides I have an army royal of Royalists, that now live under the Squestration-Planet, J shall muster them up if need be. But first I will go mashal up my Forlorn-hopes of Taterde|mallians, welch, English, Scols, and Irish. J hope to give these Rounda breakfast, for all they vapour now; I hope to bring 'um under my dominion shortly.

Exit Penia.

Enter Scrape-all, Clodpole, Stiffe, Dicaeus, and Poverty.

Clodp.
Naighbours, I'ch hear we must chop Logick with Poverty; 'cha wonder what this Logicking is, tid never know yet te yeer: they zay one gaffer Aristotle was the first vounder of it, A bots on him!


Scrap.
Cha remember my zon went to the Varsity, and I ha heard him say a fine song:

Hang Brerwood and Carter in Cakanthorps garter,
Let Kkerman too bemoan us:
J'le be no more beaten for greasie Iack Seaton,
And conning of Sandersonus.

At Oxford or Cambridge 'twould make a man a hungry to heare 'um talk of Gismes and Argations, and Pretticables and Predi|caments, and gatur Antecedens and Proums and Postriorums, and Probo's and Valleris. Cha think this Logick a hard thing next to the Black-Art.


Stiff.
Naighbours, an't be zo, what a mur|rin ails us! why, shall we venture Plutus on Pretticables and Predicarments? shall we lose all our hopes by an Argo valleris? This is my pinion, this same Poverty will prove the best Computant of um all: why, she cannot choose but repute (as Mr. Ficar sayes) very well, and most tregorically.


Dicae.
Tregorically! Categorically neigh|bour; Sir Iohn meant so I warrant you.


Stiff.
VVhy, tregorically, and catergoli|cally; Te and Cater, there's but an ace dif|ference, therefore bate me an ace quoth Bolton, and I say she will repute very well and tregorically, for she hath ever kept com|pany with Scholars ever since my memory or my Granams either. No, let me take my Catergorical Flail in hand; and if J do not

thresh her to death with lusty arguments, let me never live to problem again at a Pease|rick.


Dicae.
Naighbours, be content. Poverty stand you on one side and Ile, stand on the other; for I will be opposite to you  dia|metro, and teach you to know your distance. Thus I dispute. The question is, Whether Plutus ought to receive his eye-sight? I say I,  sic probo.

If it be fit that good and honest men,
Whose souls are fraught with vertue, should possesse
Riches and wealth, which Heaven did mean should be
The just reward of goodnesse: while proud Vice,
Stript of her borrowed and usurped robes,
Should have her loathed deformities un|masqued;
And vitious men that spread their Peacocks trains,
Have carkasses as naked as their souls.
But if once Plutus should receive his eyes,
And but discern 'twixt men, the world were chang'd:
Then goodnesse and full coffers, wealth and honesty
Might meet, imbrace, and thrive, and kisse together;
While vice with all her partners starves and pines,
Rotting to dirt and filth, leaving to hell
Black souls. Who better counsel can devise?
Ergo 'tis fit Plutus receive his eyes.



Clodp.
That Argo has netled her, I war|rant. Thou shalt be Plutus his Professor for this. VVhat has my she-Bellarmine now to answer?


Dicae.

As the mad world goes now, who could believe
But pur-blind fate and chance did hold the scepter
Of humane actions? VVho beholds the mi|series
Of honest mortals, and compares their for|tunes
VVith the unsatiable pleasures of grosse E|picures,
VVhose bursten bags are glutted with the spoiles
Of wretched Orphans: who (I say) sees this,
But would almost turn Atheist, and forswear
All heaven, all gods, all divine providence!
But if to Plutus we his eyes restore,
Good men shall grow in wealth, and Knaves grow poore.



Stiff.
In my pinion this simple-gisme


Dic.
Fie neighbour, 'tis a Syllogisme.


Stiff.
VVhy simple and silly is all one: be what Gisme it will be, sure 'twas not in true mud and fig-tree, there was never a Tar-box in the breech of it.


Pen.
O Dotards, how easily you may be perswaded to die as arrant fools as you were born! If Plutus recover his eye-sight, and distribute his riches equally, you shall see what will become of your Anabaptistical Anarchy: what arts or sciences would re|main. If every Vulcan be as good as your selves, what Smug will make your VVorships dripping-pans?


Dicae.
VVhy he that makes the Fire|shovels and Tongs or if all fail, Quisque est fortun suae faber, we'll make our driping pans our selves: we can do more then that, we can preach to our selves already.


Pen.
VVho would coble your shooes, or mend your honorable stockings?


Dic.
O there be Sermon-makers enough can do that bravely: the only Metaphysicks they are beaten in, Rem acuangunt.


Pen.
VVho would carry you up to London, if the VVaggon-driver should think himself as good a man as his master?


Dic.
VVhy we would ride thither on our own Hackney-Consciences.


Pen.
Nay if this were so, the very Tailers though they damn'd you all to hell under their shop-boards, would scorn to come to the making up of as good a man as Pericles Prince of Tyre.


Dic.
Marry that were a happy time for the Low-Countries: the Spanish Pike would not then be worth a Bodkin.


Pen.
There would be no Presbyters to directorise you, no Landresses to sope you, no Plough-men to feed you, no Inne-keepers

to fox you, no Sycophants to flatter you, no Friends to cheat you. Ergo you have brought your hogs to a fair market.


Stiff.
How she proves her self a Sow in conclusion!


Dic.
'Twas in Conclusion, that it might not be denied. Me thinks Poverty disputes very poorly, and that's a wonder; for likely the naked truth is on her side.


Clod.
Yet she remembred an Argo, and that made her argument not so weak and im|pudent: in my pinion this Argo is a Quarter|staffe at least.


Dic.
And (Poverty) what good turn can you do us, except it be to fill our eares with the bawlings of hungry brats and brawling bastards? No doubt you can bring us a flock of fleas and a herd of lice to store the pa|sture grounds of our miserable Microcosmes; the unmannerly hogs with hunger betimes to desire us to deferre our breakfasts a fortnight longer. You can give us field-beds, with heaven for our canopy, and some charitable stones for our pillows. VVe need not expect the felicity of a horse to lie at rack and man|ger; but yet our asses and we must be con|tent with the same provender. No Rost-beef, no shoulders of Mutton, no Cheese-cakes, no Matchivilian Florentines:

And whence our greatest grief does rise,
No Plumb-porredg, nor no Plumbpudding pies.

Ergo (Poverty) I will answer your arguments at the whipping-post.


Lackl.
That was strong and piercing for Plumb-porredge: for truly one porrenger of Plumb-porredge is an argument more un|answerable then Campians ten Reasons.


Dic.
Aliter probo sic. Your poor crea|tures have not wherewith to buy themselvs; but it is not fit that the soul should go a beg|ing for the charges of the bodies funerall. Ergo falleris Domina Poverty.


Pen.
You do not dispute seriously, you put me off with trifling gations. Thus I dispute. If I make men better then Riches, I am to be preferred before Riches. But I make men better: for poor men have the better consci|ences, because they have not so much guilt, J call their empty purses to witnesse. Aliter probo sic. J moralize men better then Plutus: Exemplum gratia: Plutus makes men with pufft faces, dropsie bodies, Bellies as big as the great Tub at Heidelberg; Noses by the vertue of Malmsie so full of Rubies, that you may swear, had Poverty had dominion in their Nativities, they had never had such rich faces: Besides, they have eyes like Turky|cocks, Double-chins, Flapdragon-cheeks, Lips that may spare half an ell, and yet leave kissing room enough. Nay, 'tis the humour of this age, they think they shall never be great men, unlesse they have grosse bodies. Marry I keep men spare and lean, slender and nimble; mine are all Diminutives, Tom Thumbs, not one Colossus, not one Garagan|tua amongst them; fitter to encounter the enemy by reason of their agility, in le dan|ger of shot for their tenuity, and most expert in running away, such is their celerity. Ergo, Irus is a good souldier, and Midas is an asse.


Scrap.
Troth she has toucht Midas; she has caught him by the worshipful ears.


Dic.
Nay tis no wonder if they be slender enough, you keep them with such spare diet: they have so much Lent and Fasting-dayes, that they need not fear the danger of being as fat as Committee-men. If a man should see a company of their lean carkasses assem|bled together, 't would make him think Dooms-day were come to town before its time.


Pen.
Moreover, that which is most noble is most preferrable. But Poverty is most noble. Minor I prove thus: Whose houses are most ancient, those are most noble: But Poverties houses are most antient; for some of them are so old, like Vicaridge-houses, they are every hour in danger of falling.


Clod.
What a silly womans this to talk of Nobility houses! Does not she know we are all Levellers, there's no Nobility now.


Stiff.
Neighbour, I think so too: I am an Unpundant too, I think.


Dic.
Nay she does not dispute well. Her Ma was born in Bedlam, her Minor ws whipt in Bridewell, Ergo her Conclusion is

run out of her wits. For well said M. Rhombus, Ecce mulier blancata quasi lilium. Now I oppose her with a Dilemma, alias the Cuc|kold of Arguments. My Dilemma is this: Citizens and Townsmen are ich, for there's the Conucopia; Ergo, Riches are better then Poverty. Nay, i Riches were not in some account, why would Iupiter be so rich? for you see he has engrossed to himself the golden age of , and the silver age of Shillings and Six-pences, and left us no|thing but the brazen age of Plundring and Impudence; for Tinkers Tokens are gone away too. To conclude in one syllogisme more, J will prove my Tenet true by the example of  Queen of Hell; she would turn the Clark of her Kitchin out of his of|fice, and not suffer him to be the Devils man|cple any longer, if he should bring any lean carkasse or any carrion-soul to be served up at her table. Her chief dish is the larded soul of a plump Usurer, basted with the dripping of a greasie Alderman; the sauce being made with the braines of a great Conger|headed Lawyer, butter'd with the grease of a well-fed Committee-man, served up for want of sawcers in the two eares of an un|conscionable Scrivener. Ergo, Poverty, you may go and hang your slf.


Pen.
O for the Barbadoes! J have no place left for my entertainment.


Dic.
Come brethren, let us kick her out of the Universe.


Pen.
O whither shall J betake my self!


Dic.
To the house of Charity.


Pen.
To the house of Charity? that's an old ruin'd cold lodging, as bad as a Corre|ction house. Good your worships, take some pitty on miserable Poverty!


Dic.
Did you ever hear such a solecisme?


Lack.
Troth master, J never knew it in my life: All our Parish was ever against it.


Clod.
And ours too, and J think all Eng|land over.


Dic.
Poverty, then J say thou shalt have a Justice of Peaces charity, the whipping|post; thou shalt be lasht under the statute of sturdy Rogues and Beggers: look for no pitty, 'tis charity to pitty those that are rich: Go get you packing.


Pen.
VVell, sirs, though you put Poverty away now, yet you or your heirs may be glad to send for me ere long.

Exit Poverty.

Clod.
Jt shall be to the gallows then, by my consent: if you mean to prevent it, the best way is to go and pine away quickly.


Stiff.
Farewell old Rag of Babylon, for we must be rich, and therefore worshipfull.
Exeunt omnes.
By your leave Mr. Parson.

Musick.


Act. 2. Scaen. 6.
Enter Clip-latine a Parson, Dicaeus a Parson, Clod-pole, Stiffe, Scrape-all.

Dic.
Last night J laught in my sleep. The Queen of Fairies tickled my nose with a Tithe-pgs taile. J dreamt of another Be|nefice, and see how it comes about! Next morning Plutus the God of wealth comes to my house, and brings me an Augmentation and a good fat Living. He said he came to visit me: as sure as can be J am ordained to be rich at his Visitation, 'tis better then the Bishops or Archdeacons. Now must J be one of the Assembly, and walk demurely in a long black Clak at Westminster, forgetting all my Greek and Latine.


Clip.
Faith brother, that have J done al|ready: my name's Clp-latine truly; J read a Homily, and pray by the Service-book divinely.


Dic.
Divinely, quoth a! Thou must take Ex tempore in hand, or else thou wilt nere be rich in these dayes.


Clip.
Do you hear, neighbours! shall us leave the Common-Prayer?


Stiff.
God forbid, Mr Ficar! why 'twas writ in Davids time; and Thomas Stenhold and Iohn Hopkins joyn'd it to the Psalms in those dayes, and turn'd it into such excellent Metre, that J can sleep by it as well as any in the Parish.


Clod.
Besides, naighbour, we don't know this new Sect what they pray, we can't vol|low them in their Extumperies.


Clip.
You see the case is cleer, Sir: J am

for the King and the Prayer-Book.


Stiff.
VVell said Parson, we shall love thee the better for that, hold there still.


Dic.
Yet (Brother) because thou art of our cloth, I'le speak to Plutus for thee. Thou shalt have twenty pounds per annum standing stipend, and the love of thy Parish because thou takest nothing of them, Doest mark me? Twenty pounds, I say. I must be gone.

Exit. Dic.

Clip.
A good saying and a rich. Now shall I surfiet in a Sattin Cloak; from twen|ty nobles to twenty pounds! O brave!


Scrap.
VVe are glad of it vaith Mr. Ficar.


Clip.
Come Neighbours, upon this good news, lets chop up and to my Nost Sngo's, he'le be glad to hear of it too. I am resolved to build no more Sconces, but to pay my old tickets. Come let's in and drink a Cup of stingo.


Stiff.

Vaith Vicar, thou givest us good de|struction still.
Come in, come, come.




Act. 2. Scaen. 7.
Enter Blepsidmus, Chremyls, Caion.

Blep.
O the divinity of being rich! Now Plutus is come. But who is Plutus? VVhy, he is the Noblemans Tutor, the Princes and States flet of Plte, the Lawyers Littleton, the Major and Aldermens Fur-gown, the Justice's Warrant, the Constable and Bum|bailies Tip-staffe, the Astronomers Blazing star, the Mathematicians Record or counting table, the Cavaliers Service-book, the Pres|byterians Directory, the Independens Ex|tempore, the Popes golden Legend, the Fri|ars Nun, the Monkes Breviary, the World|lings God, the Prelates Cannons, and Bi|shops Oath, c.I could reckon more, but he is the very Ladder to worship and ho|nour. I must be rich, and therefore hono|rable, and proud, and grave.


Chr.
O gentleman-like resolution!


Blep.
Yet now I think on't, J will not be grave; for grave bodies do naturally descend to base Conditions, which is clean contrary to the complexion of my humour; yet J will cry hum with the best in the Parish. J will understand as little as the  Citizen of them all.


Chr.
Marry, and that's a proud word, Blep|sidemus.


Blep.
I will sleep as soundly at Church and snort as loud at Sermons as the Church|warden himself, or the Master of the Com|pany.


Chr.
O infinite ambition!


Blep.
I will entertain none for my Whores under the reputation of Ladies, unlesse they be Parsons daughters.


Chr.
O! because they may claim the be|nefit of the Clergie.


Blep.
I will daign none the honour of be|ing my worships Cuckolds, that is not a round-headed Brother of the Corporation.


Chr.
He'el make it a principle of the City Charter. Horns of such making, will be of as great esteem as the Cap of maintenance.


Blep.
Hereafter Gentlemen, hereafter, I say, in contempt of a penny quart, I will throw Pspot-lane in the face of Py-corner: J will be foxt no where but at Round-headed Inns, that J may be honestly drunk, and carry it with the greater gravity and safety. The soule of Sack and the flower of Ale shall be my drink, that my very Urine may be the quintessence of Canary.


Chr.
VVhy then, Vspasian might desire no greater Revenue, then the reversion of your Chamber-pot.


Blep.
But come let us withdraw, and car|ry Plutus to the Temple of Esculapius; Ca|rion make ready the necessaries, see you play the Sumpter-horse with discretion. Let us make haste, for J long to be worshipfull.

Come friends, this day gives period to our sorrow,
VVe will down caes in bowles of Sack to morrow.


Exunt amo.




Act 3.

Scaen. 1.
Enter Penia Poverty, Higgen, Termock, Brun, Caradock, and an Ar|my of Rogues.

Pen.

Souldiers, you see men Poverty de|spise
Since God of Riches hath recover'd eyes;
Let us invade them now with might and main
And make them know their former state a|gain;
March forth brave Champions, though your Noble Valours
Be out at Elbows, shew your selves to be
Patches of worth, rags of Gentility.
Brave Blades, arayed in Dish-clouts, dirty Plush,
Like the grave Senators of Beggars-bush;
VVith Poverty, sole Empresse of your States,
Spend your best blood, you have no wealthy Fates:
Me thinks I see your Valours, and espie
Each rag, a Trophy of your Victory.
Come Bun, thou worthy Scot of gallant race,
VVhat though thou lost an arm at Chevy|chase,
Resume thy valour. And thou Caradock,
True Leek of Wales, Pendragon's noble stock
Stir up thy Welsh-blood to encounter these,
With zeal as fervent as thy toasted Cheese.
And thou brave Red-shank too, Termock by name,
VVonder of Red-shanks, Hybernia's fame.
To conquer these, or scatter them like chaff;
Or lick them up as glib as Usqubaghe.
And Higgen thou, whose potent Oratory
Makes Beggars-bush admire thy eloquent story,
Come bravely on and rescue me from dan|ger,
Else Poverty to you will prove a stranger,
Which heavens forbid.



All.
Poverty, poverty, poverty for our money!


Pen.
Nay, without money Sirs, and be constant too.


All.
Poverty, poverty, poverty, our Pa|tronesse!


Carad.
Cats plutrer a nailes; Her were best by her troth take very many heeds, how her make a commotion in her stomachs; if her ploud be but up twice and once, her will tug out her Sword, and gads nigs, let her take very many heed, her will carbonado very much Legs and Arms. By St: Taffie, I'se tear the most valiantest of them all into as arrant Atomes as there be motes in the Moon. Try he dare whose will; I tickle their hoop|sir Dominees, else, never let her sing hapate|ry, while she has live any longer. If her doe not conquer them upside down, let her ne|ver while she lives in Heuiope, god blesse her, eat Coush-bobby with the man in the Moon. Her Coshen Merlin her Country-man, hath told her in a Whisper, very a many much tale of her valour above forescore and twenty years since.


Pen.

Bravely resolved; O how I love thy Valour!
Tis sweeter then Metheglin, I all Canarvon cannot afford a Comrade half so noble.



Ter.
And Termock vill shpend te besht ploud in hish heelsh in the servish.


Pen.
Renowned Termock, thanks from our Princely self.


Ter.
Nay, keep ty tancks to thy self, Ter|mock is ty trushty shubsheckt.


Brun.
And aies ws gang with thee Mon. Aies have bin a prupder gud man in the Bor|ders. Aies fought blith and bonny for the gewd Earle Duglasse: Aies show thy foemen a Scutch trick. Aies mumble their crags like a Sheeps-head or Cokes-nose, Ais I do not let me bund to Sup with nothing but Perk and Sow-baby.


Pen.

VVell said brave Brun, hold but thy Resolution,
And never a Souldier breathing shall excell thee.



Brun.
Nay's mon, aif I cannot give 'um mickle rashers enough my self, aies gang home to my Bellibane and get lusty Martial Barns, shall pell mell their Noddles: What gars great Higgen?



Hig.

Attend, attend; I Higgen the grand Oratour
Begin to yawn, lend me your Asses ears;
Give auscultation. Higgen, whose Pike-staffe Rhetorick,
Makes all the world obey your Excellence
By cudgelling them with Crab-tree elo|quence.
By lusty Doxies, there's not a Quire Cove,
Nobler then I in all the bowsing Kens
That are twixt Hockly 'ith' hole and Islington.
By these good stampers, upper and neather Duds;
Ile nip from Ruffmans of the Harmanbeck,
Though glimmer'd in the fambles, I cly the chates:
I'le stand the Pad or Mill, the Churches de|neir.
Nip bungs, dupp gibbers leager, lowze and bowse.
Liggen in strommel, in darkmans for pannum
Should the grand Ruffian come to mill me, I
VVould scorn to shuttle from my Poverty:



Pen.

So, so, well spoke, my noble English Tatter,
Lead up the Vant-guard, muster up an army,
An army royal of Imperial Lice.



Hig.

And J will be the Scanderbeg of the Company,
The very Tamberlane of this ragged rout;
Come follow me my Souldiers



Brun.
Yaws grand Captain, fir, suft and fair; gar away, there be gewd men in the Company. Aies Captain, for aies have more scutch Lice, then thou hast English creepers, or He Brittish Goats about him.


Hig.

VVhat then? my I ice are of the no|ble breed,
Sprung from the Danes, Saxons and Nor|mans blood;
True English-born, all plump and all well savour'd:
Take warning then good sir, be not so proud,
As to compare your Vermine sir, with ours.



Ter.
Pleash ty shit grash, let nedder nod|der of them my shit Empresse have te plash of ty Captain, J am te besht of edder odder. J have seen te fash of the vild Irish. Termock knows vat it is to fight in the Pogs like a valiant Costermonger, up to the Nosh in ploud. Not to make much prittle and prat|tle to none purposh Termock has fight un|der Oncale, for her King and Queen in te wars. Vat, J speak tish by te Shoes of Patrick, if that Termock be the Captain, thou shalt beat ty foes to peeces and pashes.


Carad.
Is Caradock no respected amongst her; Her Lice are petter a pedecree as the gooddst of them all. Her Lice come ap Shin|kin, ap Shon, ap Owen, ap Richard, ap Mor|gan, ap Hugh, ap Brutus, ap Sylvius, ap E|neas, and so up my shoulder. An't her Lice will no deshenerate from her petticree pre|tious Coles. Her ancestors fought in the Wars of Troy, by this Leck, as lustily as the Lice of Troilus. Nay, by St. Taffie, the Lice of Hector, were but Nits in comparison of her magnanimous Lice. Do not disparage her nor her Lice, if her love her guts in her pelly.


Ter.
But if Termock have no Lish, sall l e derefore not be te Captain? Posh on her Lish. Termock hash none grash a Patrick; no such venemous tings vill preed in hish Country.


Hig.

I will be Captain, for my Robes: re martiall:
Tue martiall Robes, full of uneureable wounds.
My Doublet is adorned with thousand scars,
My Breeches have endured more storms and tempests
Then any man's that lyes perdue for Pud|dings.
I have kept Sentinel every night this twelve moneth;
Beheaded Ducks and Geese, spitted the Pigs,
And all to Victual this camp of Rogues.



Carad.
'Faith, and her clothes are as anci|ent a petticree as thine, her fery Dublet is coshen sherman to utter P. ndragons Sherken, or else Caradock is a fery rogue by Saint Taffie.


Pen.

You shall not thus contend, who shall be Captain;
I'le do't my self, Come follow me brave Souldiers.



Brun.
I faith! she is a brave Virago mon.


Carad.

By St. Taffie, she is an Amashon, a Debora,
A Brunduca, a Ioan of Oleance,
Pucelle de Dieu, a Mall Ctpurse, a Long-meg of Westminster.



Ter.
She sall be te Captain, for all tee, or any odder in English lond.


Hig.

Whips on you all! follow the Fe|mine gender?
Fight under th' Ensigne of a Petticoat?
An act unworthy such brave spirits as we:
Remember our old Vertues, shall we forget
Our ancient Valous? Shall we in this one action
Stain all our honour, blur our reputations:
Can men of such high fortunes daign to soop
To such dishonourable terms? How can our thoughts
Give entertainment to such low designes?
My spirits yet are not dissolv'd to whey,
J have no soule, so poor as to obey,
To suffer a smock rampant to conduct me.



Brun.
Aife thou's keep a mundring man|dring, mon, i'se gang to Edinborow. The Deill lead your army for Brun, aies no medle, Adieu, adieu.


Carad.
Ah Brun! Blerawhee, blerawhee.


Ter.
Ah Brun, Brun! Shulecrogh, fether vilt thou, fether vilt thou?


Brun.
VVhat yaw doing mon to call Brun back; and you be sules, I'le stay no lenger.


Carad.
Ah Brun, Brun! shall be Captain, by all te green Sheese in the Moon. Brun shall be Captain for Caradock, if her would not give place to Brun her heart were as hard as Fint-shire.


Ter.
Brun sall be te besht in te company, if tere were a tousand tousand of 'um.


Hig.

I'le not resigne my right, J will be Captain.
'Tis fit I should: Hath not my valour oft
Been try'd, at Bridewell and the Whipping|post?



Pen.

Let Higgen then be Captain, his sweet tongue
And powerfull rhetorick may perswade the Rout.



Carad.
Cats plutter a nailes, Higgen shall be Captain for her Ears; yet Caradock will be valiant in spight of her Teeth.
Ho brave Captain Higgen!


On.
Higgen, a Higgen, a Higgen.


Hig.

So then Souldiers, follow your Lea|der: Valiant Brun
Lead you the Rear; you Termock shall com|mand
The Regiment of Foot. Generous Caradock
Have you a care of the Left-wing.



Carad.
O disparashment to her reputa|tion! Brutus hish Coshen look the whing. Think you her will flee away. Her will stand to it tooth and naile, while there be skin and bones in her pelly.


Brun.
Let the Army gang to the Deill. Aies no medle.


Ter.
Stay tere man, vat to doe Brun?


Hig.

My brave coradoes, Knights of tat|ter'd Fleece,
Like Falstas Regiment, you have one shirt among you.
Well seen in plundring money for the Ale|house.
Such is the fruit of our Domestick broiles,
We are return'd to ancient Poverty
Yet (seeing we are lowsie) let us shew our breeding.
Come, though we shrug, yet lets not leave our calling:
Leiutenants Rampant, bravely all train'd up
At the well skil'd Artillery of Bridewell;
March on brave souldiers, you that neer turn'd back
To any terrour but the Beadles whip.



Brun.
St. Andrew, St. Andrew.


Car.
St. Taffie, St. Taffie.


Hig.
St. George, St. George.


Ter.
St. Patrick, St. Patrick.


Pen.

Saints are discarded.
But Andrew, Taffie, George, and Patrick too
May the whol esse of them be all propitious!



Hig.

If any do resist us, let us throw
Our Crutches at them. J have here
An empty sleeve to strike out all their teeth,
Besides a makin to wipe all our wounds.
Be valiant, and as ear'st the Spanish Cobler
Injoyn'd his eldest sonne upon his death-bed:
See you do nothing, that may ill beseem
The Families you come of; let not the ashes
Of your dead Ancestours blush at your dis|honours;
Encrease your glory of your House; for me
J'le ne're disgrace my noble Progenie.




Car.
Caradock disgrash her Petticree? No, by St. Prutus bones; her will fight till her stand, while tere be legs in her beels. If her pe killed, her will not run away.


Brun.
Aies gar away? Aies not budge a foot by St. Andrew.


Ter.
Termock disgrash hish fadders and mudders? Termock will stand while tere be breath in his breech.



Act. 3. Scaen. 2.
Carion, Clodpole, Lackland, Stiff, Scrape|all, to them.
Carion whips them. they run.

Pen.
Higgen, Scandebeg, Tamberlain, grand Captain Higgen.


Hig.
Souldiers shift for your selves. VVe are all routed.


Pen.
Is this you would not disgrace your noble Progeny?


Hig.
My Ancestors were all footmen. Run|ning away will not disgrace my Progeny.

Exit.

Carad.
O disgrash to peat St. Taffie's coshen! Use the true Prittih no petter?


Pen.
Caradock, will you and your Lice disgrash her Progeny? The Vermin of He|ctor and Troilus would not do so for all A|chilles Myrmidons.


Car.
Her do follow her petticree from head to foot: Her Grandsire Enas ran a|way before.

Exit. Carad.

Brun.
Marry ill tide thee mon, use a mon of our Nation no better.


Pen.
Generous Brun, I thought you would not have budg'd a foot by St. Andrew.


Brun.

VVhat of that woman? Aies no en|dure Poverty,
The Scuts love mickle wealth better then so.


Exit. Brun.

Pen.

Act. 3. Scaen. 3.
Carion and the Rusticks, Clodpole, Stiffe, c.

Car.
So now you see Carion for his valour may compare with Don Quixot or the mirror of chivary. Come, come along you old for|tunate Rascals, you that in the dayes of Queen Richard fed upon nothing but barly|broth and puddings, you shall be rich you rogues all of you, feed hard at the Councel|table.
How daintily wilt thou become a scarlet Gown, when such poore snakes as I shall come with Cap and Knee, How does your good Lordship? Did your Honour sleep well to night? How does Madam Kate and Ma|dam Ciss, have their Honours any morning|milk-cheefe to sell? Will it please your Lordship to command your servant to be drunk in your honours-wine-seller? Your Honours in all duties, and so J kisse your Ho|nours hand.


Clod.
Thou shalt kisse my Honours taile. Then will I again say, Fellow, how does thy honorable Lord? tell him he does not con|generate from the noble family he comes of: I would have some confabilitation with him concerning a hundred of his Lordships pitch|forks. But I am going to the Bench, and with the Committee to firk up the proud Priests before us, and humble the Country. Tell him Madam Kate is as sound as a Kettle: thou shouldst have concourst with her Ladiship, but she is skimming her Milk-bowls, and melting her dripping-pans as busie as a body|louse. Now fellow go into my wine-cellar to play on my sack-buts, and take no care for finding the way out again. But sirrah, see you drink my Honours health: your see I can tell what belongs to Lordships, and what is more to good manners. But what's the newes a|broad, my honest Coranto stilo novo sub .


Car.
I know not what to say, but that my

master is Emperor of Constantinople, a second Tamberlain; we shall have nothing but glary Beefe and Bajazers in every Cup-board. Plutus has left stumbling; the puppy is nine dayes old, and can see perfectly. Gra|mercy Esculapius! tis pitty but thou shouldst have a better beard then Apollo thy father. O Esculapius, the very Pultise of Surgeons, and Urinal of Physitians!


Clod.
Vaith neighbours, then let us make bone-fires: this newes is as sweet as Zugar|zopps.
(He sings.)

My Iane and I full right merrily, this jollity will avouch,
To witnesse our mirth upon the green earth, together we'll dance a clatter-do-pouch. clatter-de-pouch, clatter, c.



Lack.

And then will J kisse thy Kate and my Cisse, as soon as J rise from my couch.
The wenches ile tumble and merrily jumble,
Together wee'll dance a clatter-de-pouch.



Cho.
clatter-de-pouch, clatterdec.


Car.

Jle kisse if J can our Dary-maid Nan,
Together we'll billing be found:
Let every slouch dance clatter-de-pouch,
Together we'll dance a Sellengers round.



Lack.
J will not be found at Sellengers round, although thou do call me a slouch. Banks's horse cannot prance a merrier dance Then rumbling and jumbling a clatter-de|pouch, clatterde c.


Cho.
Then rumbling c.

Exeunt Clodpole, Lackland.
Enter Mrs. Chremylus, manet Carion.

Mrs.
Here's rumbling and jumbling in|deed. I was spinning my daughter a new smock, and they keep such a noise I cannot sleep for um. Passion o' my heart, I wonder what news there is abroad, and why that knave Carion makes no more haste home.


Car.
Now will I be an Emperor, and con|temn my Mistresse


Mrs.
Cari what news Carion?


Car.
I cannot answer them to day, com|mand the Embassadors to attend our will to morrow.


Mrs.
Why Carion, I say!


Car.
Go give him my gold-chain and pretious jewel.


Mrs.
What are you mad?


Car.

And a rich cup-board of my daintiest plate.
VVell, let me see what it will cost me now,
For to maintain some forty thousand men
In arms against the Turks.



Mrs.
Sirra, do you know your self?


Car.
Suppose I lend some twenty thousand millions.


Mrs.
Some twenty thousand puddigs.


Car.
And send two hundred saile to con|quer Spain, and Rupert too, and fright the Inquisition
Out of their wits


Mrs.
If any be out more then thou, Ile be hanged.


Car.

The King of Poland does not keep his word:
And then my Tenants for my Custom-house
Are twenty hundred thousand pounds behind hand.
In Haberdashers-Hall, or the Ile of Tripoly.



Mrs.
Take that for your Haberdashers|hall, or Isle of Tripoly.

(she cuffs him)

Car.
Traitors; my guard! where are my Beef-eaters? O my old Mrs. was it you? why, are you not drunk with mirth? I was in good hope ere this to have seen you reel|ing in a French hood. VVell, have at your old petticoat. Madam, I have news will ravish you, my dainty Madam; a bushel of unmea|surable joy.


Mrs.
Then prethee tell thy comfortable message; and if it tickle me in the telling, I will give thee a pair of high-shooes more then thy quarters wages.


Car.
Listen then while I anatomise my whole discourse from the head to the heel.


Mrs.
Nay good Carion, not to the heel.


Car.
But I will, though your heel were a Polonian, or a French heel, which is the fashion.


Mrs.
Nay do not molest me, Carion. I am

very squeamish, and may chance have a qualm come over my stomack.


Car.
Then I begin. First we came to the god leading Plutus, then most miserable, but now as happy as Fortunatus his Night-cap. First we made him a Dipper, we duckt him over head and ears in water, we made him n Anabaptist.


Mrs.
Alas poor soul, 'twas enough to have put him into an ague: one would not have used a Water-spaniel more unmercifully.


Car.
No, nor a curst quean in a cucking|ool, Mrs. You see what creatures these dip|pers are. J warrant when the young Lasles were a dipping, the blind Rogue could see that well enough. Well, Mrs. coming to the Temple of Esculapius, where all the altars stood furnisht with reaking pasties and ot pippin-pies, O 'twas such sweet religion, my mouth watered at it. Just upon the hearth they were beathing a great black-pudding, to stay the gods stomack till breakfast. Here we laid Plutus in a cradle and rockt him a|sleep.


Mrs.
O the folly of such Simpletons, lay n old man in a cradle!


Car.
And why not? is he not a child the second time? Next, every man made his own bed: the liberal god allowed us fresh pease|straw.


Mrs.
And was there no more lame and impudent creatuers at this Spittle-house?


Car.
Of all sorts, mistresse. There was a young heire newly crept out his wardship, that had been sick of a young Lady three years and upwards.


Mrs.
Just as I am of Chremylus. Sirra, seeing you are of good parts and properties, you may presume to come sometimes into my bed-chamber.


Car.
No mistresse, the Dary-maid shall serve my turn. Next was a pretty waiting|gentlewoman, that with dreaming of her Lord, was fallen into a terrible Green|sicknesse.


Mrs.
Now by my holidame, J could have cured that my self; if she be troubled with the maidenhead-grief, J can give her as quick deliverance as any Esculapius in Europe.


Car.
Many Lawyers were troubled with the itch in their fingers; many young Heires in a consumption; burst Citizens so over|swell'd with interest-mony, that they were in danger of breaking; many Treasurers, Sequestrators and Receivers came for help, for they had received so much monies, that they had lost their eye-sight, and could not see to make accounts: there were Townsmen came to have their brow-antlets knockt off, Presbytians for the Directory, Cavies for the Service-book; some Tradesmen and Scholers, that had long fed upon costive Usurers, being much bound, came to the Temple to be made solluble.


Mrs.
Nay, if he be so good at it, Ile go and see if he can cure me of my corns; they vexe me so wonderfully, J cannot sleep for um.


Car.
Marry Iove forbid, mistresse! should your corns be cured, how should my master do for an Almanack to foretell the weather? Pond, Booker, Allestree, Ieffry Neve Gent. nay nor Merlinus Anglicus, are not half so good Astronomers as your Ladiships pro|phetique toes.


Mrs.
Masse if it be so, J shall save him two pence a year, rather then put him to the charges of an Almanck. But was there any more?


Car.
Yes there were many Country-lobs, that having surfeited on the glory-bacon of their Milk-maids favours, were fain to repair to the next Alehouse for purgations. Deaf Scriveners came for their cares; Silenc'd Ministers to be cured of dumbnesse; many Scholers of Colledges, whose gowns having been sick divers years of the scuf, desired the god to do them the grace as to change the colour of that disease into the black-jaundies.


Mrs.
And did he cure them all?


Car.
All but Neoclides; a blind fellow, and yet such an arrant thief, that he stoe all things he set his eyes on. To proceed: the Monk put out the allow-tapers, bid us sleep, and whatsoever hissing we heard, to see and say nothing. There we slept soundly, and in the honour of Esculapius snorted most de|voutly. Marry J could not sleep: for there was an old woman with a pitcher of pease|porredge

at her head lay next to me. Now I had a great zeal to devoure the delicious pil|low: but putting forth my hand, I espid the bald Friar eating the religious cakes, and cracking of the consecrated nuts. So I think|ing it a peece of divine charity, studied how to cheat the old Beldame.


Mrs.
O sacrilegious Varlet! wert not a|fraid of the god?


Car.
Yes, lest he might cosen me of my pease-porredge. The woman perceiving me put forth her hand: then I fell a hissing like a Winchester-goose on S. Georges dragon; the woman snatcht back her fangs, and for very fear smelt like the perfume of a Polecat: in the interim I supt up the porredge; and my belly being full, I laid my bones to rest.


Mrs.
Aud did not the god come yet?


Car.
O mistresse, now comes the jest: when the god came neer me, my devotions a posteriori sent him forth most ridiculous orisons; the Pease-broth in me was so windy that I thought I had an Aeolus in my belly; my guts wambled, and on the sudden evapo|rated a clap or two of most unmanerly thun|der, the very noise of it broke all the Urinals in the Spittle-house, and saved Esculapius the labour of casting Iupiters water; it fright|ed his poor Apothecary out of his wits, as he was making Saturn a glister  and for the smell, Penacea told her father that she was sure it could not be frankincense.


Mrs.
Yes, but was not the god angry that you kept your backside no closer?


Car.
Who he! 'Tis such a nasty Numen, he would be glad if your close-stool were his alms-tub, that he might feed upon your meat at second hand.


Mrs.
Nay, but leave your windy discourse, and proceed with your tale.


Car.
At length two snakes appeared, and lickt Plutus eyes: then Aesculapius beating Aigus his head in a mortar, tempered it with a look beyond Luther, well minced with the rosted apple of his eye: the whole confection boil'd in a pint of christalline humour, which being dropt into his eye with the feather of a peacocks tail, he recovered his sight in the twinkling of an eye.


Mrs.
But how came the god of wealth blind?


Car.
How! Because Honesty is like a Puck-fist; he never met it but once, and it put out his eyes: besides, the rich Rogue had too many Pearls in his eyes.


Mrs.
And what are we the better now his eye-sight is restored?


Car.
Why thus: None but honest people shall grow rich now; there's the wonder: my master Chremylus shall be an Earl, and you from the Cream-pot of Rusticity shall be churn'd into the honourable Butter of a Countesse.


Mrs.
Nay, they were wont to call me Countesse before: and I shall do well enough for a Countesse, I warrant you. I thank my stars, I can spin as fine a thred for woollen, as any Countesse in England. Well Carion, now I am a Countesse, Mrs. Ficar shall not sit above me in the Church; I will have as fine a stammel-Petticoat and rich Stomacher as the proudest of them all. Pithee Carion go to the Goldsmith, buy me a ring, and see it be well enamour'd.


Car.
You would say enamell'd. But Mrs. what will you do now?


Mrs.
I will go in to present the gods new Eyes with a basket of Pippins and a dozen of Churchwardens.

Exeunt ambo.
Enter Plutus, Chremylus.

Plut.

Good morrow to the morn next to my gold:
First bright Apollo, I salute thy rayes,
And next the earth Minerva's sacred land.
Truly  soile, Athenian city.
How my soule blushes, and with grief remem|bers
My miserable blindnesse! wretched Plutus,
Whose hood-winkt ignorance made thy guilty feet
Stumble into the company of Rascals,
Informers, Sequestrators, Pettifoggers,
Grave , Sycophants and unconsci|onable Coridons,
And Citizens whose fals Conscience weigh'd too light
In their own seales, claim'd by a principall Charter
The Cornucopia proper to themselves.
When good just men, such as did venture lives
For Countries safety and the Nations honour,
VVere paid with their own wounds, and made those scars
VVhich were accounted once the marks of honour,
The miserable priviledge of begging,
Scarce to have lodging in an Hospital.
And those whose labors suffer nightly throes
To give their teeming brains deliverance
To enrich the land with learned merchandise
The sacred Traffique of the soule, rich wise|dome:
Starve in their studies, and like moathes de|voure
The very leaves they read, scorn'd of the Vul|gar,
Nay, of the better sort too many times,
As if their knowledge were but learned wick|ednesse,
And every Smug could preach aswell as they:
Nay, as if men were worse for Academies.
But all shall be amended. I could tell
A tale of horrour, and unmask foule actions;
Black as the night they were committed in.
I could unfold a Lerna, and with proofs
As clear as this deer light, could testifie
How I unwilling kept them company.



Chre.

O heaven forbid! what wicked things are these?
Yet such there be, that lock into my com|pany,
In swarms as if they would dvoure me quick,
That throng so fast, as if they'd crow'd my soule
Out of her house of clay: while every man
Employes his supple hams, and oily tongue
To fained complements and importunate ser|vice.
I could not walk th' Exchange to day, but straight
Each head was bare, every officious knee
Bowed to my honour, and enquired my health;
And which is more intolerable, snow-white|heads,
VVhose every hair seem'd died in innocence.
VVith that one leg which was not yet i'th' grave,
Croucht like so many Tapsters. These spring-tide friends,
These swarming Flies, bred by the summers heat;
Should but adversities black cloud appear,
VVith lowring looks, theatning a winters storm,
Farewell my summers swallow: these are friends
To Cremylus cupboard, and affect I see
My Oysters and my Puddings, 'tis not me.


Exit.
Enter Mrs. Cremylus.

Mrs.
Marry gods blessing oth' thy soule! Now a hundred good morrows to thy eyes. I have brought the a dish of Pearmains and Pippins, with a dish of Lordings and Lady|apples, and some of our country fruit, half a score of Russetings.


Plut.

O 'tis unfit, my eye-sight being re|stored,
To accept a kindenesse till I have bestowed one.



Mrs.
Marry and muff! I can be as stout as you if J please. Do you scorn my kindenesse?


Plut.

Apples and Nuts, weel eat 'um by the fire,
VVhere the rude audience shall not laugh at us:
'Twere an absurdity in a Comick Poet
To make a musse of sweetmeats on the Stage,
Throwing a handfull of ridiculous Nuts
To catch the popular breath and ignorant praise
Of preaching Coblers, Carmen, Tinkers, Taylors.



Mrs.
Nay, 'tis e'en true, the good old Gentleman speaks very wisely; you may be|lieve him, if you please. I'le be sworn, this morning, the Lay-Clergie, while they were a preaching at Bell-ally in Colemanstreet, I came by with my basket; the hungry Ras|cals in pure zeal had like to eat up my Gin|ger-bread, had there not been Popish pi|ctures upon it; I had much adoe to keep them from scrambling my Apples too, had not the sets of my old Ruffe lookt like so ma|ny Organ-Pipes and frighted them. But

faith rake-hels, (and you mend not your manners)  complain to Mr. Goodwin and the 'mittees too. Come in good Gentle|man, though I have never a tooth in my head, yet i'le crack Nuts with my Gumms but ile bear thee company.

Exeunt ambo.

Finis Actus Tertii.


Act 4.

Scaen. 1.
Caron Solus.

Ca.
To be rich is the daintiest pleasure in the world; especially, to grow rich without ventring the danger of Tiburn or Whipping. Every Cupbord is full of Custards, the Hogs|heads replenished with sparkling Sacks. The veriest Gippo in the house will not drink a degree under Muscadine. All the Porredge|pots are arrant Barbary gold. All the Vessels in the house, from the Bason and Ewer to the Chamber-pot and Vinegar-bottle, are of Middletons silver. The Kitchen and Buttery is entire Ivory, the very purity of the Ele|phants tooth. The Sinke is paved with the rich Rubies, and incomparable Carbuncles of Sir Iohn Oldcastle's Nose. The Conduit runs as good Rose-water as any is in Ari|stotles Well. The Dish-clouts are cloath of Tissue, and from the skirts of every Scullion drop melting streames of Amber grease. We the poor servants play at Even and Odd with arch-angels, and at Crosse and Pile for Ja|cobusses, in a humour, to out Philip the King of Spain. My Master is sacrificing a Sow, a Goat, and a Ram for joy; But J could not endure the house, there is such a smoak from the reaking of the roast, that though it please my stomack, my eyes are offended with it.

Enter Gogle and his Boy carrying his Shoes and Cloke.

Gog.

Boy follow me, for J have a zeale to be rich;
My devotion leads me in the righteous path
To Plutus god of wealth. Prophane poverty
Is a Carthusian, and a grand delinquent,
One o'th' malignant party up in arms
Against the well-affected.



Car.
Say Brother, who are you, whose righteous Shoes conduct you hither?


Gog.

Ananias Gogle, verily.
A devout Brother, that hath oft been plun|dered
By wicked persecution: but last night
My dreaming spirit fretold J should be rich
And happy made by Revelation.



Ca.

Gogle, or Cogle, a Geneva brother
Of sanctified snuffling, a pure Elder
Oth' precise cut, or else past Ordinances.



Gog.

No, but a zealous Saint of Amster|dam,
Whose Nose is forward to promote the cause;
Crosses are Romish Jdols, yet misfortune
Has put so many dismal Crosses on me,
Till every crosse was spent, and sent away
On superstitious Pilgrimages: fie upon't,
That zeal and ignorance should be conver|tible.



Car.

VVhat would you have, dear brother? for J think
J have heard you Exercise at Bell-alley.



Gog.

'Tis true, but yet
J come to Plutus Conventicle now.
'Tis he can cure my troubles, he brings joy
To the fraternity of Amsterdam,
To the Geneva brotherhood, and the Saints
VVhose pure devotions feed on Bunbury Cakes:
He can restore my wealth, give me abundance
Of holy Gold and Silver purified,
Jncrease my talents spent upon the Sisters,
That J may thrive again as did my father
That reverent Saint Gogle, Patience Hypomoe
A holy Taylor and a venerable Parson.



Ca.
Say Brother, may a Taylor be a Par|son?


Gog.

'Tis very fit: For first, his sacred Parchment
Can take the measure of Religion;
And from the Cloth of a good Conscience
Make up a Suit for honest Conversation:
Sewed with the thred of Goodnesse, stitcht i'th' Seams
With twisted Silk of Piety and Innocence
Lined with good Thoughts and charitable Actions:
The sacred shreds and snips of holy Carsey
May chance to mend the Garments of the Righteous,
If Satan come to rend their guiltlesse robes.



Car.

But were you not in miserable con|dition,
Before that Plutus came to speak amongst you?
He speaks with golden eloquence, believe't:
For now your zealous bags are full again
With holy silver, and good Brotherly gold;
You cannot fall to desperation,
Having so many Angels to defend you.



Gog.

Yea certes: therefore now I find god Plutus
Has made me Collector of his contributions.
I must needs thrive, therefore I take occasion
To give the god the greatest gratulation.



Car.

But tell me, zealous brother, why doth that boy
Carry that Saint-like Cloak, and upright Shooes?



Gog.

Cloaks are for Saints; they preach in Cloaks all now:
Gowns are all Popes: no Sermons without Cloaks.
This holy Cloak and I these thirteen years
Have freez'd together, and these upright Shoes;
Not upright once, till their ungodly soles
That always went awry, were rightly mended
By a religious conscionable Cobler,
With Leather liquor'd in most zealous tears.
These shooes, I say, ten winters and three more
Have traced the Conventicles of the Bre|thrn.
These shoos, this Cloak J come to dedicate
To Plutus, in requital of hs kindnesse.



Car.
What, your shooes come for Conse|cration?


Gog.

Now fie upon your Popish Conse|cration!
This Cloak is not a rag of Babylon.
I offer these as Presents: this same is
A well-affected Cloak; and zealous shooes,
Never prophaned with irreligious toes.
Such precious gifts they are, such devout presents,
He cannot but accept them verily.


Enter Never-good.

Nev.

O hone a cree  hone!
My empty purse and belly weep for sorrow,
And every string and gut poures lamenta|tions.
I was a Sequestrator once, and used
To find occasions of Delinquencie
Committed against the State, like a Pro|mooter.
But now my guts have sequestred my belly,
And let it out to others. Wretched state
Of them that die in famine! But in me
Jerusalems dearth is here epitomiz'd.



Car.
Garret Ostle-bridge was down, welladay, welladay.


Nev.

As I was wont to inform against Malignants,
So now my guts give informations
Against my teeth and stomach. Wretched Nere-be-good!
J now must pine and starve at Pennylesse-Bench,
Who starved Orphans and delinquent Pri|soners,
Like a Committees Marshal. Now I see
VVhat 'tis to want a little honestie.
Oh that the Philosophers truly had defined
The Moon Green-Cheefe! J would desire the man
That dwells in such a blessed habitation,
To rost me one poor piece before I die,
That for my Epitaph men might write this Note,
Our Sequestrator had a VVelsh-mans throte.



Gog.

Now verily I find by revelation,
This is a Varlet of no honest fashion;
VVho 'cause he had no honest occupation,
Is faln into most wretched tribulation.



Nev.

O hunger, hunger! Now good sky fall quickly,
Or J shall die ere it rain Larks. VVho could
Endure to have his goods confiscate thus
By the blind puppy Plutus! VVell, young Cerberus,
Ile hire the Furies to pull out thy eyes,
And once more put thee to the trade of stum|bling.



Ca.

This is a Rascal deserves to ride up Holborn,
And take a pilgrimage to the triple-tree,
To dance in Hemp Derricks Caranto:
Lets choke him with Welch Parsley.



Nev.

Good friend be mercifull, choke me with Puddings and a Rope of Sausages,
And I wil thank you here and after death;
For I shall die I fear for want of choaking.
VVhere is the god that promised golden mountains
T'enrich us all: is this the gold he gives me?
He has not left me coyn enough to purchase
A messe of Portage, like my brother Esau.
Empson and Dudley, happy were you two
Being the prime Sequestrators of your age,
That you were hang'd before this day of fa|mine.
I pine and starve, live to outlive my self,
Turn Ghost before J die. Blinde fornicator
Plutus hath sequestred the Sequestrator.



Gog.
J tell thee out of zeal to th' Cause thou lyest.


Nev.

So my good zealous Brother of ig|norance,
And what sayes your Amsterdam Nose? you think
That every man turns Factor for the Divel,
A Reprobate, that comes not every night
To hear your fine reformed Basket-maker
Preach in his VVicker Pulpit: you shall not think
To have my money thus, you shall not think it.
Prate any longer here, mutter again,
And J will make thy pretty Brotherly soule
Come snuffling through thy sanctified no|strils.



Ca.
Nevergood, J know was alwayes fierce


Nev.

Yes indeed sir, for now my Panch is empty;
J'de have you know, J have an excellent sto|mach.



Ca.

J will do what J can to make this flesh
To have a Combat with this furious spirit.
Ananias Gogle, do you see this Heretick
ow he triumphs against the Lay-preaching Brother-hood?
Go to him man, and beat him.



Gog.

'Tis a strong Reprobate. He would sequester me
VVere J not for the Cause. J will not touch him
He will defile my purest hands; he is
A lump of vile corruption. Breathe th' other way;
Thy very breath's infectious, and it smels
As if thou hadst caught the Pox of the Whore of Babylon.



Nev.
So sir, you dare not fight.


Gog.

J will not fight. It is thy policy to have me fight,
That J might kill thee, and pollute my hands
VVith swinish blood. No, no, J will not fight
To make my self unsanctified.
J will dispute with thee, Nose against nose,
And valiantly J dare to snuffle with thee,
Jn the defence of silver-purified.



Nev.

Would Plutus had no better Cham|pion to defend him!
Then such as onely snuffle in the Cause.
J would presume by my own proper valour
To make a breach into the strongest Cup|board,
Were it as strong as Basing-house or Bristol.



Gog.

Avant thou Synagog of iniquity,
J see thou art oth' Popish tribe: Necessity
Does make thy Guts take Purgatory pen|nance,
Brings thee to shrift and shift, makes thy teeth observe
Unconscionable Fridayes, prophane fasting|dayes,
VVith Lent and Antichristian Emberweeks.



Nev.

Tis much against my conscience, my devotion
Lies toward the Kitchen. If J change my faith,
J will turn fat Presbyter or Anabaptist.
J never loved this heresie of fasting,
Plutus has put me out of Commons. Yet my Nose
Smels the delicious odour of Roast-beef.



Ca.
VVhat doest thou smel?


Nev.
J say, J smell some Cavaliers Roast|beef.


Ca.

Out on thee Varlet, J warrant thoud'st fain sequester it.
Jf the despaire of dining vex thee thus,
J can acquaint thee with a liberall Duke
That keeps an open house.



Nev.

J charge thee by the love thou bearest thy stomack,
By all the happinesse of eating puddings,
And every Pie thou meanest to eat at Christ|masse, To tell me who



Gog.

Now out upon thee for a roguish He|retick!
is not a Christmas, tis a Nativity Pie.
That superstitious name, J know, is banisht
Out of all England, Holley and Ivie too.



Ca.

VVhy? go to Pauls, Duke Humphrey wants a guest;
If his Rooms now be clean from Souldiers Horse-dung,
There you may stay and walk your bellyful:
Bid your self welcome, never pay your Ordi|nary,
Nor say no Grace, but thank your self for hunger.



Nev.

O misery of men, that J the health
And lover of my Country should thus pine
And die for want of Porredge! See you Chimney,
VVhat sweet perfumes, what comfortable smoke
It breaths; that very smoke doth smel of Mutton.
VVell, J shall die, and all the Worms will curse me
For bringing so lean a careasse to the grave.



Gog.
Answer to me.


Nev.
VVhat, to those narrow Breeches?


Gog.

Do not prophane my Breeches. For these Breeches
I tell thee were in fashion in the Primitive Church.
Answer to me.



Nev.
VVhat will you Catechise me?


Gog.
Art thou a Farmer?


Nev.

No, heaven forbid, J am not mad,
To live y Dung and Horse-turds.



Gog.
Art thou a Merchant?


Nev.

'Faith J can walk the Exchange,
Put on an Indian face, spit China fashion,
Discourse of new-found VVorlds, call Drake a Gander,
Ask if they heare news of my Fleet of Ships
That sail'd by land through Spain to the An|tipodes
To fetch Westphalia Bacon. J can discourse
Of shorter wayes to th Indies, spend my judg|ment
On the plantation of the Summer Isles.
Censure Guiana Voyage, deam of plots,
To bring Agier by shipping unto Dover.
Then of Prince Rupert's ships, and how the Pope
May make St. Dunstan draw the Devil to th' Peak,
To make him kisse his own Breech.
This can J talk with Merchants, in the close
Invite my self to Dinner at their houses,
And borrow money ne're to be repaid
Till the return of my silver Fleet from Persia.



Gog.

Now fie upon thee, hast thou no vo|cation,
No honest calling? then art thou not a Law|yer?



Nev.

No faith, J am not; yet know a trick
To bring my neighbours into needlesse suits,
And undertake their actions: make 'um pay
For such a motion at the Dogs-head avern
A mark or two; disburse a peece or two
For Affulavits at the Mitre: sell 'um
For twenty shillings an Injunction,
VVrits of Rebellion, Chancery Decrees,
A Nisi prius, or a Latitat.



Car.
Poor souls, they have very hard words for their money.


Nev.

When this is done, I sit and laugh at them:
Then they may buy a VVrit of Execution
And go and hang themselves. For J feed on them
All the Term long, live with them in Vaa|tion,
Cheating them by Bils of Return.



Gog.
Vile Rascal, hast thou no other shift?


Nev.

Faith yes, sometimes
I feed on One and twenties, cheat young Heirs,
Bringing them acquainted with some cozen|ing Scrivener,
To ease them of the burthen of too much earth.
Sometimes I woe old widowes, go a suiring
Unto the thirds of an Aldermans estate
Sometimes prick up my self  grow familiar
VVith the proud wealthy Citizens wanton wives,
And by the fortitude of my back maintain
Both back and belly.



Gog.

O sink of sin, and boggards of cor|ruption!
Hast thou no honest calling?



Nev.

Yes J have: J know a trick to snuffle at Bell-Ally,
Raile at the Steeple-houses, and the Popish Bishops,
And the Tithe-scraping Priests, Sir-John-Presbyters.



Gog.

Out on thee Villain, foe to the holy Cassocks.
J do remember thee in the Archbishops time,
Thou madest me stand ith Popish pillory
VVith Prin and Buron, only for speaking
A little sanctified treason.



Car.

But we will be reveng'd; we'll have him drag'd
Through all the town by Alewives, and then hang'd up
Upon a Sign-post, for conspiring with
Sir Giles Mompessons, in the persecution
Of innocent Tapsters.



Gog.

Come, seeing he has no zeale nor ardent love,
Let's strip him naked, till he freeze  grow
As cold as Charity.



Nev.

VVhat will you plunder me? where's your warrant Ho?
Do, sanctified thieves, plunder: yet J shall live
To see my little Anabaptist come
To his twelve Godfathers, thence to the Ladder;
VVhere having nosed a tedious Psalm or two
The holy hemp must gird your sanctified wind-pipe,
VVhile you in honour of the righteous cause
VVith a wry-mouth salute the soules at Pad|dington,
And turn a Tyburn-Saint.



Gog.

Pull off his profane and irreligious Doubler,
Anathematize his Breeches, excommunicate
His impious Shirt: there's not a rag about him,
But is heretical, full of Babylon lice,
Like the foul sinock of Austria.



Nev.

So, do it if you dare: that J may live
To see your fine precise Geneva-Breeches
Hang in the Hang-mans wardrobe. Ho bear witnesse.



Car.

Nay faith your witnesse is not here: a Mandrake
Has frighted him: the hue and cry was up
'Twas time to trust the safety of his neck
Unto the swiftnesse of his heels. Come, come,
Uncase. So now Ananias Gogle
Lend me your cloak to cloak this Sycophant.



Gog.

My cloak! his Romish carkasse shall not be arraied
In these pure innocent robes: shall any ba|stards
Of the vile generation of Pope Ioan
Defile my cloak, that has these thirteen years
VViped my belovep nose, whose very snot
Is reverenct by the brethren? No, he may bring
These garments to the Masse, prophane uni there,
And make my cloak a reprobate, and commit
Adultery with the seven hills: besides,
He is an Idol; and I verily think
It were idolatry to let this cloak
Embrace a Pagan. No, good cloak, nere turn
Apostate from the faith of Amsterdam.
Good cloak, be not a-kin to Iulians jerkin:
Though thou be thred-bare, thou shalt nere be turn'd;
No, no, 'tis fitter Plutus have thee.



Car.

No, Plutus shall have this, 'is fresh and new:
Your cloak is thred-bare; your too fervent zeale
Has almost made it tinder.



Gog.

What, Plutus have his cloak! Oh 'tis the skin
Of a pernicious snake. O Popery!
A profane Cope, or the Levitical smock,
I mean a Surplisse, is not more unlawful.



Car.

As it is now: But wipe your nose on't thrice,
'Tis sanctified; you know the brotherly snot
Has enthusiastique operations in't.




Gog.

I am perswaded. Let him have it then.
But what shall be decreed of my upright shooes?



Car.

Wee'll hang them on his head. How his Brow-antlets
Become their furniture! By S. Hughs bones,
He looks like the very ghost of a shoomakers shop.



Gog.

O swear not by St. Hugh, that cano|niz'd Cobler.
Come holy brother, let us drag him hence.



Nev.

Do, Scundrels, do: but if I once come a fequestring,
Ile go to Dr. Faustus, true son and heir
To Belzebub, whom the great Devil begot
Upon a Succubus, on Midsummer Eve,
As Hell was sowing Fernseed. This D. Faustus
The Mepiastophoius of his age, the wonder
And the sole Asmodaeus of his times,
Shall by his Necromantick skill (Fortune my foe)
In the Black-art lend me his Termagant,
Old Almegroth, o Cantimelopus,
Or some Familiar else an houre or two.
Thence Ile to Phlegeton, and with him drink
A cup of Hells lapdragon, and returning
Spue fire and  into Plutus face,
To roast the rottch apple of his eyes
With Srygian flames that I revomitize.


Exit Nev.

Gog.

We fear not Dr. Faustus: his Land|lord Luciferd
Sayes that his Lease with him is out of date;
Nor will he let him longer tenant be
To the twelve Houses of Astrologie.



Car.
Let Dr. Faustus do his worst. Let me see if this Termagant can help you to your Clothes again.

Enter Anus.

Car.
But stay, what worm-eaten Hag is this? Holy brother, let's away to Bo-peep, we shall be seen else. Do you not perceive that old Beldame of Lapland, that looks as if she had sail'd thither in an egg-shell, with a wind in the corner of her handkercher? I am not so much afraid of Dr. Faustus, as of that witch of Endor.

Exeunt Gogle, Carion.


Act. 4. Scaen. 3.
Anus sola.

An.
Hey ho! methinks I am sick with lying alone last night. Well, I will scratch out the eyes of this same rascally Plutus god of wealth, that has undone me. Alas poor woman! since the shop of Plutus his eyes has been open, what abundance of misery has befallen thee! Now the young Gallant will no longer kisse thee nor imbrace thee: but thou poor widow must lie comfortlesse in a solitary pair of sheets, having nothing to cover thee but the lecherous Rug and the bawdy Blankets. O that J were young again! how it comforts me to remember the death of my maidenhead! Alas poor woman, they contemn old age, as if our lechery was out of date. They say we are cold: methinks that thought should make um take compassion of us, and lie with us, if not for love, for charity. They say we are dry: so much the more ca|pable of Cupids fire; while young wenches, like green wood, smoke before they flame. They say we are old: why then experience makes us more expert. They tell us our lips are wrinkled: why that in kissing makes the sweeter titillation. They sweare we have no teeth: why then they need not fear biting. VVell, if our lease of Lechery be out, yet me|thinks we might purchase a Night-labourer for his dayes-wages. I will be reveng'd of this same Plutus, that wrongs the orphans, and is so uncharitable to the widows. Ho, ho, who's within here!

Enter Scrape-all.

Scrap.
VVho's there?


An.
A maid against her will this fourscore years. Goddy-godden, good father: pray which is the house where Plutus lives?


Srap.
Mary follow your nose, you may smell out the door, my little damsel of fifteen,

but fifteen times over. In my pinion, this young Lasse would make a pretty Maid|mairian in a Comedy to be presented before Plutus.


An.
Now god save all. By your leave sweet Grandsire! J will call forth some of the house.


Scrap.
VVhat need that? cannot J serve the turn?


An.
No marry can you not. Nay, as old as J am, J will not bestow my widows maiden|head at second hand on such a frosty Nestor. J will have March or April; J scorn to com|mit fornication with December.


Scrap.
Nay good Autunme, do not mis|conceive me: J askt if J could not bear in your errand or no. But J see master Chremylus coming.

Enter Chremylus.

An.
Alas good sir! J have endured the most unjust and unsufferable injuries, since Plutus has regained his eye-sight, as ever poor woman did since the dayes of Queen Edmund. Alas sir, life is not life without natural recreation.


Chr.
How's this? some Promooter of the feminine gender!


An.
No by my chastity, but an honest matron of Turn-bull, that have paid scot and lot there these fourscore yeers, yet never was so abused as now.


Chr.
What abuse?


An.
Unsufferable abuse, intolerable in|juries.


Chr.
Speak, what injuries?


An.
An injury unspeakable.


Chr.
VVhat is it?


An.
Alas sir, tis lying alone. O the mi|sery of lying alone! would J had been below ground ere J had seen this minute of adver|sity. Ah Turnbul-Grove, shall J never more be beholding to thy charitable shades! Ah 'twas a good world when the Nuneries stood: Oh their charitable thoughts that took so much compassion on poor women, to found such zealous bawdy-houses! Had not Crom|wel been an Eunuch, he had never perswa|ded the destruction of such places set up for such uses. 'Twas a good world too in the dayes of Queen Mary: a poor woman might have desired a kindnesse from a lusty Friar in auricular confession. But Plutus eyes are like Basiliss, they strike us dead with ad|versity.


Chr.
VVhat ails this Skin-ful of Lechery? alas poor Granam, dost thou grieve because thou wantest money to go drink with thy gossips!


An:
Ah do not mock me sir: 'tis love, parlous love that has so enflamed my heart with Bavins of desire, that J am afraid he will make me the very bone-fire of affection.


Chr.
VVhat meant the knavish Cupid to set this old Chark-coal on fire?


An.
Ile tell you sir: there was a young Gallant about the town, one Neanias.


Chr.
J know him.


An.
He being a younger brother, had no lands in taile-tenure, but City-widows. He was but poor; but as fine a well-favour'd Gentleman, it did me good at heart to look on him. J ministred those things he wanted; and he recompenced my kindnesse in mutual love: as I supplied his wants, so he succored my necessities with all possible activity: I would not have changed him for Stamford, though he jump'd the best in London.


Chr.
And what did this pretty Pimp usu|ally beg of you?


An.
Not much: for he reverenced me wonderfully, partly for love, but more fo venerable antiquity. Sometime he would beg a Cloak.


Chr.
To cover his knavery.


An.
Sometimes a pair of Boots.


Chr.
To exercise his horsmanship.


An.
Sometimes a Peck or two of Corn.


Chr.
For which he paid a bushel of affe|ction.


An.
Now and then a Kittle for his sister, a Petticoat and French-hood for his mother. Not much: all the good turns I did him in the day, the conscionable Youth requited ere midnight.


Ch.
This was nothing indeed: it seems he did reverence you, (as you say) partly for

love, but more for your venerable antiquity.


An.
Nay, he would tell me too, that he did not ask these things for his mid-night wages, but only in love. He would not endure to wear any thing, but what I paid for, out of a mee desire to remember me.


Chre.
This was infinite affection! Could he not endure to wear anything but what you paid for? 'Twas dear love this, pretty love tricks 'faith; you may see, how the wanton youth was enflamed with your beauty.


An.
I but now, the unconstant Wag has not the same measure of respect; I sent him a Custard yesterday, and he would not accept of it, because it quaked like my worm-eaten. I sent him other sweetmeats too, but he return'd me answer, that certainly J had breath'd on them, for they smelt of my Gums. Moreover, he bid me despaire of a night|labourer, and never more expect him at mid|night again. For Plutus has made him rich without me; adding withall, That once J was young: Ostend was once a pretty town. The Milesians in the dayes of yore were valiant: and in the dayes of King Henry the English were sturdy fellows at the battell of Agin-Court.


Chre.
Faith, J commend the stripling for his wit. Tis none of the worst conditions. Now he is rich, he will have the best and plumpest Cockatrice of the City; when he was poore he was content with Porredge. There be many of that profession, that main|tain themselves by hugging the skin and bones of an Aldermans widow.


An.
I, but earst, he would have come eve|ryday to my door.


Chre.
Perchance a begging.


An.
No, onely to hear the melody of my voice.


Chre.
Like enough, Jt could not choose but please him to hear what excellent Musick your Jews-trump could make, now all your teeth are out.


An.
If he had but seen me sad and melan|cholly, he would have kissed me with such a feeling of my sorrow, and have call'd me his Chuck and Helena.


Cre.
'Twas onely to have one of Leda's Egs to his Supper.


An.
How oft has he prais'd my fingers?


Chr.
Twas when he lookt for something at your hands.


An.
Many a time has he sworn that my skin smelt sweeter then a Musk-cat.


Chr.
He meant a Poe-cat: did you not believe him? Twas when his Nose first smelt of Hippocrasse, or else the perfume of your white-leather was so strong, he could not en|dure it.


An.
O how it comforts me to remember how he would call my eyes pretty sparkling ones.


Chr.
Twas cause they pinckt like the snuff of a Candle. Faith the Gentleman had his wits about him: he knew how to get the old wives provision, the Viaticum she had pre|pared to carry her to Gravesend.


An.
Therefore, my friend, Plutus is to blame to promise relief, when he does us such intolerable damages. How do you think J can endure to lie alone, when so many sprights are walking? How shall J keep off the Night|mare, or defend my self against the tempta|tions of an Incubus.


Chre.
Alas good Relique of antiquity! pay thy Fine and take a new Lease of Lust. Faith J pitty thee; what would'st thou have him do if he were here?


An.
Marry, that since J have deserved so well of him, that he doe me one kindenesse for another. Good old Gentlemen, either let him restore me my goods, or stand to his bar|gain. The Conditions not performed, the Obligation is of none effect: my Lawyer re|solves me, J may recover of him.


Chr.
Noverint universi per praesentes, your Lawyer is a Coxcomb. Did he not doe his duty every night? J warrant you, he had as lieve have tugged at an Oare as a. In my minde, he has performed his part of the Obligation.


An.
But he promised never to forsake me as long as J lived.


Chre.
No more he has not; why? thou art now dead: Thy flesh is mortified, onely thy impotent lust has outlived thee a twelve moneth or two. Thou art but a meer Car|kasse, nothing but Worms-meat.


An.
Indeed grief has almost me'td me

into dust and ashes. Half-putrified J walk up and down like the picture of Deaths-head in a charnel-house. But see yonder's my Game|ster, my Cock oth' game: he's marching to some banquet or other: 'tis Shove-Tuesday with him, but Lent with me. O grief, to be bound from flesh!


Chr.
It seems he is going to a feast, by his torch and garland.

Enter Neanias.

Nea.

Ile kisse the old Hag no more,
She has no moisture in her:
If ever I lie with a Lasse ere I die,
It shall be a youthful sinner.


Give me a Lasse that is young,
I ask no greater blessing:
Ile nere lie agen with Fourscore and ten,
A carkasse not worth the pressing.


I will not imbrace her again,
To set the Town on a scoffing:
Ile never make more Death-widdow a Whore,
And cuckold the innocent Coffin.


Who's this? Good morrow Venus, O good morrow
Old Duck, old Helen! Tell me, sweet Helen,
How hast thou done this three thousad year young Pullet!
How hast thon done ere since the warres of Troy?
Has the Cuckold Menelaus cast his ?
But what old goat is this? Tis Agammnon.
You Agammnon, is your 
As old as Helen? Tell me, old Helen, tell me,
When do the lecherous wormes and thee begin
To act adultery in the winding-sheets?



An.
What sayes my Duck; wouldst have me go to bed?


Nea.

What, my old Sweetheart! How comest thou gray so soon?
Thou canst not be so gray; J will not suffer't,
J will not be deceived, J will pull off
Thy cozening Perriwig.



An.
So sir: J was not gray when J gave you my Smock off my back to make you Night-caps. You swore J could not be above fifteen, when I translated my Stammel-Petticoat into the masculine gender, to make your Worship a paire of Scarlet|breeches.


Nea.

I shall never abide an Almanack while I live:
The Iulian Account's an arant Coxcombe;
But the Bissextile is an arrant Villain.
J will curse every Bissextile in the County of Europe.
Tho couldst not possibly be gray so soon,
Except a hundred Leap-years had conspired
To jump together, to make thee old oth' sudden.



Chr.

He talks as if he had not seen you since the Conquest:
How many Jubilees past since he was last with you?



An.
Now fie upon him! How long do you say? 'Tis no longer then yesterday, by the faith of a woman, since he had the fruition of me, and swore J was as young as He|cuba.


Chr.
Then it is not with him as it is with others: for being drunk, he hath the use of his eyes more perfect then when he was sober.


An.
No, the peevish fellow, now he is drunk, he sees double, and thinks me twice as old as J am.


Nea.

O Neptune, and the other gray|bearded gods,
Can you with all the Arithmetique of heaven
Number the wrincles of this Beldames fore|head?
These many rus and furrows in thy cheek
Proves thy old face to be but Champion|ground,
Till'd with the plough of age, well muckt with sluttery:
Tis time for thy lust to li sallow now.
Can any man endure to spend his youth
In kissing winters frozen lips? can veines
That swell with active blood, endure th' em|braces
Of such cold ice? Go and prepare thy coffin,
Think on thy winding-sheet. When I was poor,
Cold limbs and empty guts perswaded me
To lie with skin and bones. Necessity,
As cruel as Mezentius tyranny,
Made me commit adultery with a carkasse,
A putrified Corps, a Bawd oth' Charnel|house.
But now good dust and ashes, pardon me,
These arms shall never more imbrace thy corps.
Thou stewes of clay, thou mud-wall of mor|tality,
Go rot and moulder; and if thy impotent lust
Must needs be satisfied, know Hell is a hot|house,
Perchance some hot-rein'd devil may under|take thee;
Ile lend a halfpeny to pay Charons boat-hire.
No, I will now choose me a good plump Lass,
As moist as April, and as hot as May,
VVhose Damask-check shall make the Roses blush,
VVhose lips at every kisse shall strike a heat
Into my veins, breathing through all my soul
An aire as warm and sweet as the perfumes
That smoaking rise from the dead Phoenix nest.


Now come my boon Companions,
And let us jovial be:
Thouh th Indies be the King of Spains,
VVe are as rich as he.


As rich as any King of Spain,
In mirth, if not in wealth:
Boy fill me then a bowl of Sack,
Ile drink my Mistresse health.


My Mistresse is but fifteen,
Her Lips is all my blisse:
Go tell her I will come at night,
And then prepare to kisse.


You my she- may go sort the while,
Or kisse your Monky. I will take my torch,
Set her on fire, and let her smoke to Ache|ron.



An.
O fire, fire! shall I die no better a death then the top of Pauls-steeple?


Chr.
Nay take heed how you set your torch too neer her; One spark will set her a flaming, for she is made up of Salt-petre, very gun-powder well dried  ready pruned, mee touch-wood, and as dry as any tavern|bush.


Nea.

'Tis true, she'll quickly take; the fire of lust
Has  her into tinder, some of hells brim|stone,
But to make matches, and she e'll fit the Devil
For a whole tinder-box. Come my dainty Girl,
Let us be friends; why should we two fall out?
Sweet be not angry, I do love thee better
Then water-gruel: Come, let's play to|gether.



An.
Now blessing on thy heart! VVhat play shall we play, that which we plaid at t'other night?


Nea.
Here, take these Nuts.


An.
Alas my hony, I am past cracking.


Nea.
They are to play with.


An.
VVhat play?


Nea.
Even or odde, guesse you.


An.
VVhat shall I guesse?


Nea.
How many teeth there be in thy head.


Chr.
Ile guesse for her; perchance three or foure.


Nea.

Then you have lst, pay your nuts: she has but one,
An o're-wone grinder; 'tis a gentle beast,
She has forgot to bite: Good innocent gums,
They cannot hurt;No danger in her mouth,
Till she eat Braw.Her charitable tongue,
Like the old Rebels of Northampton-shire,
Cannot endure hedges of teeth should stand
To make her mouth inclosure.




An.
Well sir, you may abuse me: but by Cock and Pye, (god forgive me that I should swear) were I as young as I have been, these nailes that by a good token have not been pared since eighty eight, should have scratcht your face till it had been a dominical one, and as full of red letters as any Ponds Almanack in Christendome, 'twere suitable to your prognosticating Nose. J think you are mad; would any but an Olando or Ie|ronymo have used a poor woman so? Do you think I will endure to be your bucking-tub to be washt with the dregs of your wit


Nea.
He did you a courtesie, that would wash you soundly.


Chr.

O by no means: why she is painted Sir.
If you should wash her, then my Ladies fucus
Would drop away; her Cerus and Pomatum
Being rub'd off, would to the world betray
The rugged wrincles of her slabber'd face.
Take but the white-lome from this old mud|wall,
And she will look worse then Gamaliel Rasey.



An.

Are you a Bedlam too, old frosty Squire?
Are you fourscore, and yet your wit an infant
Not come to age? Come, I will be your Guardian.


She beats him.

Chr.

Good Mr. Neanias, sweet young master,
If you do not save me from this Medusa,
Her Gorgons head will urn me to a Stone|bottle,
And then throw me at my self, to make me beat out my own brains.



Nea.

Nay take her to your self, old im|pudent Goat,
To ravish a Maid before her Sweet-hearts face,
O most inhumane! Yet you may do't for me,
J will resign my interest: so farewell.
uch joy unto you both. O Hymen, Hymen,
What a fine couple of sweet Loves are here,
To keep their wedding in the grave, and get
A sonne and heire for Doomsday



An.
No prethee do not think so, J sweare by Venus J would have none but thee, though Pgasus and Buccphalus came a wooing to me.


Nea.

Yes you may have him: yet J can|not leave thee
VVithout a teare to quench my flames of love. He weeps.
VVell now farewell: live happy in his love,
Venus and Cupid blesse your marriage-sheets,
And let you snort this hundred yeares to|gether.
Jle grieve the while, and Sacks best vertue try,
To drown my cares: sorrow (you know) is dry.



Chr.
Nay by Hecate you shall not put a trick on me thus. J have not out-lived my wits: J were mad if J would run my self in|to another Scylla, having such a dangerous Charybdis of my own at home. Good Mr. Neanias, J did not think she had been your mistresse: J will not for all the world do you such a wrong as to be your Corrival: love her alone for me.


Nea.

Yes to be dor'd. Good wickednesse, no more:
Do not intreat me to endure the noose;
J shall go marry her, be the fool her husband,
But you will come and kisse her; send your men,
Your Serving-men to fox me in your cellar,
VVhile you the while shall cuckold me at home:
O what a brave Actaeon should should J be!
VVhat have you nere a journy-man, or Baily
To put her off to? or, if all fail, no Chaplain
I am no free-man, therefore the City-charter
VVill not grant me the priviledge of such harnesse;
Pray beare your Cap of maintenance your self.



Chr.

Come leave this jesting, ile endure't no longer;
I will not let you hate this pretty Lasse.
S life it may prove her death: These wanton girles
Are very subject to eat chalk and coals.
S'lld, too much grief for you, with thoughts of love,
May chance to generate the green-sicknesse in her.



Nea.

Nay, I do love her dearly, wondrous dearly,
Her eyes are Cupids Grubstreet: The blinde archer
Makes his love-arrows there; bright Glo|worms eyes,
No rotten-wood out-shines their glorious lu|stre,
Faine would J kisse her.



An.
Faith and thou shalt my little peri|winckle.


Nea.

No, heaven me blesse!
J am not worthy of such happinesse.



Chr.
Yet she accuses you.


Nea.

How, accuses me? what hainous fault,
VVhat sinne, what sacriledge have J com|mitted
Against the reliquies of her martyr'd beau|ty?



Chr.
You mocked her, she sayes, you told her, The Milesians were valiant in the daies of yore. Faith do not hit her in the teeth with contumelious proverbs.


Nea.

Hit her ith' teeth, why 'tis impossible:
Hit her i'th' gums we may, but no man li|ving
Can hit her in the teeth with any thing.
Jle not fight for her, take her to your self:



Chr.
Pray good sir.


Nea.

J reverence your age; tis your gray haires
That are such potent suitors, 'twere a sinne
To deny any thing to a snow-white head.
None else but only you should have obtained her;
Therefore rejoyce, be gone, and stink to|gether.



Chre.
J know your meaning, you are wea|ry of your stale Whore, you deale with her even as they doe with horses, when they are no longer fit for the Saddle, turn them over to the Carmen.


An.
J will not live with any but with thee.


Nea.

But what an Asse am J thus long to talk
With an old Bawd, that lost her maiden|head
Above two thousand years before Deucalions flood,
VVho living as long a VVhore, turn Bawd in the daies of King Lud?



Chr.
Nay, since you have drunk of the Wine, you must be content with the Lees.


Nea.

J but her Lees are bitter, sowre as Verjuyce,
Meer Vinegar, Vinegar; J will sell her
For two pence a quart, Vinegar, Vinegar, in a VVheel-barrow.
J will go in  sacrifice my garland to Plutus.



An.
Jle go in too, J have some businesse with Plutus.


Nea.
But now J think on't, J will not go in.


An.

My businesse is not much, J are not greatly,
If J stay with thee.



Chr.
Come young man, be of good cou|rage, she cannot ravish thee.


Nea.
J believe that too.


An.
Go in, Jle follow thee ith' heels, J war|rant thee.


Chr.
She sticks to him as close as a Cockle.


Nea.

Come Beldame follow me,
And in my foot-steps tread.
Then set up shop in Turnbull-street
And turn a Bawd ere thou art dead.


And when thou art dead;
This shall of thee be said,
Thou lived'st a Whore, and died'st a Bawd,
Jn hell the Devil's Chamber-maid.





Act. 5.

Scaen. 1.
Mercurius knocking.

Chr.
Who's this that knocks, the doore so hard! what, no body? Can they walk invi|sible? Ile lay my life this is a peece of St. Dunstans ghost that puls me by the Nose so? Good ghost mistake me not, J am not the Devil, J am honest Carion every inch on me. Well, I see the doores can cry for nothing, I see no body, Ile go in again.


Mer.
So ho, ho, ho, Carion, Carion, Carion stay, I say stay.


Car.
Stay let my Nose alone, 'twill abide no jeasting; Sir, was it you, that was so sawcy

with my masters doors to knock them so pe|remptorily? they shall bring an action of battery against you.


Mer.
If you had not come quickly, I would have broke them open. Go run, call forth your master and mistresse, the men and the maids, your self, the Dog and the Bitch, the Cat and the Kitlins, the Sow and the Pigs.


Car.
My master and mistress, the bastards their children, the men and the maids, my self, the Dog and the Bitch, the Ct and Kitlins I will call forth: but the Sow and Pigs would desire you to have them excused, they are not at leasure. VVhy what's the matter?


Mer.
VVhy Iupiter will put you all into a sack together, and tosse you into Barathrum, errible Barathrum.


Car.
Barathrum, what's Barathrum?


Mer.
VVhy Barathrum is Pluto's bog|gards: you must be all thrown into Bara|thrum.


Car.
I had rather the messenger were you know what. Mercury, why what wrong have we done Iupiter? I remember he has many a time sowr'd our drink with his thundring, but we have done him no injury, but once I broke his shins at football in Tutle.


Mer.

'Tis worse then so; y'are guilty of a sinne
That hell would fear to own. Since Esculapius
That Urinal, restored god Plutus eyes,
Men have almost forgot to sacrifice:
But they were wont to offer Hasty-puddings,
Spice-cakes and many dainties; nay I know
Some that have spent whole Hecatombs of Beef
To give the gods their gawdies: now they'd be glad
To eat the very brewesse of the pottage;
A rump or flap of mutton were a fee
For Ioves own breakfast; for a rib of beef,
Though it smelt of every Gippo's scabby fingers,
May any Scullion be chief Cook of heaven.
Men have I say forgot to sacrifice.



Car.

And shall: Beggerly Iove does not deserve it.
He never did us good: we are not beholding
To any of your louzy gods. Old Plutus,
Plutus has purchased our devotion,
Gold is the Saint we reverence.



Mer.

Nay faith I care not for the other gods,
Let them go stink and starve; let Cuckold Vulcan
Go earn his meat by making spits and drip|ping-pans,
And with his Tinkers budget and his Trull
Venus, may mend one hole and make ten for it.
Let Phoebus turn VVelsh-Harper, go a begging,
And sing St. Taffie for a Barley-crust.
Let Cupid go to Gubstreet, and turn Archer:
Venus may set up at Pict-hatch or Blooms|bury;
Iuno turn Oyster-quean, and scold at Billins|gate;
Bacchus may make a Drawer at a tavern,
Call for Canary for the man ith' moon.
Minerva has been alwayes poore: Braine|bastards
VVere never borne to many lands. Great Iove
May pawn his thunder-bolts for oaten-cakes.
For them I care not, but these guts of mine:
Is it not pitty Mercuy should pine?



Car.
Nay now I see thou hast some wit in thy Pericranium.


Mer.

VVhilome the Ale-wives and the fat-bum'd Hostesles
VVould give me jugs of Ale without Excise,
Fill'd to the brim, no nick nor froth upon them:
Besides they'd make me Froizes and Flap|jacks to,
Feed me with Puddings, give me broken|meat
And many dainty morsels for to eat.
O shall I never more begrease my chops
VVith glorious bits of Bacon! shall Mr|curius
Stretch forth his legs for want of Buttermilk!



Car.

Nay this injustice thou deserv'st to see,
For injuring those that have done good for thee.




Mer.

Alack and welladay,
Shall I never the Custard see,
Which the fourth day of every moneth
Was consecrate unto me?



Car.

Alack and welladay,
In vain doust thou pray  I feare:
The Custard is a deaf god,
And cannot so quickly heare.



Mer.

If Custard cannot heare,
Come Shoulder of mutton to me,
Black-pudding also with pudding-pies,
And a messe of Furmentie.



Car.

Alack poor Mercury!
For thy case J do much condole.
Thou never shalt steale again any meale
Or Spitchcock at Hockly-u'-hole.

Come faith, since Thieving is out of fashi|, (Doest remember when thou stolest Apollo's Spectacles and Vulcans Crutches) learn to beg. Suppose I am a rich Gentle|man, and thou a lame fellow; perchance I may be in the humour to give thee some|thing.


Mer.
Kinde Gentleman, for the Loords sake bestow something on a poor lame Crip|ple, that has halted before his best friends upward and downward, any time this dozen years: this leg, ile stand to it, has been lame ever since the last dearth of corn, god be with it. heaven preserve your limbs, Iove keep your feet out oth' setters, your legs out oth' stocks, your heads out ot'h pillory, your necks out oth' halters, and other such infirmitis poor mortality is subject to. May you never know what 'tis to want till you are in poverty. Good Gentlemen, take compastion on a wretched mortal, that has been troubled with a deadnesse in his arms, that he has not had the lawfull use of his hands in picking and stealing this many houres.


Car.
Sirra, sirra, you must have the lash; Ile have you whipt for a vagiant person.


Mer.
This is a Justice of Peace's charity: if this be that you'd be in the humour to give, ray keep it to your self.


Car.
Faith act a poor Souldier: men are charitable to men of arms.


Mer.
A word with you generous sir. Noble sir, thou seemest to be a man of worship, and J am one that have seen the face of the ene|my in my dayes, and ventred a bloody nose in defence of my country. Good sir, lend me a Crown till the next taking of Basing-house, and by all the cold iron about me, you shall be presently paid upon the surrender. Noble Gentleman, do not make known my ne|cessities; I would have scorn'd to have askt such a kindnesse of Hopton or Montrosse; I had rather have starved in the leaguer, and fed upon nothing but sword and buckler; and yet Hopton is a noble fellow, many a timber|peece have J spent in his company.


Car.
What service hast thou been in?


Mer.
Hot service sir, supping at the very mouth of the Martial porredge-pot, J have scall'd my lips with kissing valour. Did you never hear how J routed a Regiment of Or|monds Foot?


Car.
Never sir, how J pray?


Mer.
Sir, by this good sword if it be not true, J am an arrant liar, and never saw the wars in my life. Sir, J advanced my spear, ran with a furious tilt at them, and unhorsed every man.


Car.
Of the Regiment of Foot.


Mer.
You are in the right sir, 'twas by a metaphor. Then sir the Ensigns of my repu|tation being displaied; a valiant French|man, he was born at Madrid in Spain


Car.
By a metaphor.


Mer.
Challeng'd me the duel at Back|sword: we met at the first thrust of the Rapier.


Car.
By a metaphor.


Mer.
He shot me clean through the body.


Car.
By a metaphor still, the Rapier shot you through.


Mer.
On my crdit sir, 'twas a musket|bullet: for when the Fort saw me have the best on't, they levell'd a Canon at me ready charged.


Car.
By a metaphor, with a musket-bullet.


Mer.
And shot off both my arms. That being done, J caught him by the throat with my right hand.



Car.
When your arms were off.


Mer.
Drew out my weapon with my left, and cut off his head. J was proceeding to have run him thorow, but he askt my pardon, and I was mercifull and saved his life.


Car.
When his head was off.


Mer.
You will not believe me now, if the self same man be as live as J. Prince Ruprt knows what service I did at Marston-moore when J run away. But now to be contemned! O Poverty, foe to Valour!


Car.
Thy valour? Thou look'st as if thou hadst no stomack at all.


Mer.
Would J had a roasted Oxe to en|counter with. J have shewed my valour in Bohemia against the Imperialists, in Poland against the Turks, in Holland against the Spaniards, in Utopia against the roundheads, and is it questioned in England? J was once a fresh-water souldier, but J was seasoned at the salt Isle of Ree: there was my master|piece of valour.


Car.
What was that J pray?


Mer.
Why sir, J fought couragiously; J was in all the dangerous services, and had misfortunes in all. First sir, J was drowned in the landing, had both my Legs shot off in the assault, and ran away in the retreat as all the rest did.


Car.
How? when your Legs were shot off in the assault?


Mer.
VVhat of that? have J not VVings on my Doublet?


Car.
VVhy the, you did not run, you did but flie.


Mer.
Flying is running away by a Me|taphore.


Car.
Come thou wilt get nothing by this lying warfare. Let me try the Gipsie.


Mer.

From Aegypt have J come
VVith Solomon for my guide:
By Ciromanties J can tell
VVhat fortunes thee betide.


A Chaldee me begot,
Old Talmud was his name;
In Hieroglyphicks he excell'd,
Through Nilus ran his fame.


Come let me see thy hand,
Thou VVives hast yet had none;
But Bastinadoes at a time
About threescore and one.


He picks Carions pocket.

Car.
VVell, thou art an arrant Gipsie: at what neighbours house didst thou learn this? S'foot, how camest thou to know it? I had just threescore and one indeed. VVell, I will give thee something: But O Mercury, my Purse! I'lutus his blessing is run out of my Pockets. I will have you hanged, you rogue. There were seven thirteen-pence-half-penies, would have paid the Hang-man for above half a dozen of you. Good Mercury, thou shalt so what Ile doe for thee.


Mer.
VVell, if you will entertain me into your family, there's your Purse again, and take heed how you meet with Gipsies.


Car.
Entertain thee? VVhy, what canst thou doe?


Mer.
VVhy, let me be your Porter.  have a Ianus heart, though not two faces.


Car.
A Porter! canst thou grumble sound|ly at a rich mans gate to keep out the poore Almsmen? canst thou bark like grisly Cr|berus? No, 'twill not do, my Master needs no surley Bandogs, we shall keep open house. The office of Porter is thrust out of doores.


Mer.
Make me your Merchant.


Car.
VVee dare not: Get you to the streights of Gibraltar, we need no busie Fa|ctors, we have wealth enough: we will have no Merchants, we shall not sleep for them at nights, They will dream of nothing but new America's, drink the Canaries, snort out Ter|ra Incognita's, nose the Bermudas, ravish Virginia, talk of the fortunate Islands, or choke us up with Terra del Fogo's. No, no, I will have none of our family walk like the Antipodes with his heels upwards; if he should fall headlong into heaven, he might put out the Man in the moon's candle, and leave him to finde his way to bed in the dark.


Mer.
Let me be your Foole to make you merry.


Car.
A Fool! Let me see: we are all rich, and therefore likely we must have some fools amongst us. But what need that, we have as

good, we have some of them that fortune favours.


Mer.
Then let me be your Jugler.


Car.
Not for Zorobabels night-cap. These Hocus-Pocusses seldome come aloft for their masters advantage. You think to pick our pockets by sleight of hand, and shew us a trick for our mony: J do not like these feats of activity; therefore Presto be gone, we will have no Juglers.


Mer.
Then let me be your Poet: J'le make you Shewes and Masques, Comedies and Tragedies, Pastorals, Piscatorial Sonnets, Canto's, Madrigals and Ballads, till you are so tickled with laughter, that you cannot stand.


Car.
A Poet! no, 'tis a little too beggerly a trade; and 'tis a soloecisme if wit should meet with wealth in these dayes. Fie upon't, I can't endure jestings, Poetical furies, J had as lieve they should break wind back|ward. Your rank wits will abuse their betters. And for showes, rascally showes, 'tis pitty they are not hang'd for their impudence: There cannot be a grosse sin in a Congregation, but some mens vinegar-brains must be a rubbing of it. J warrant if J should but marry a Towns|mans daughter to day, they'd make an Actae|on of me by to morrow, dub me Knight of the forked Order. Poor shallow scundrels there be that never drank any Helicon above a penny a quart, and yet venture to make Ballads as lousie as themselves. Wry-mouth'd villains, who cannot answer to the question, if they should be asked how many of their empty Noddles go to the making up of a compleat Coxcomb. But yet J do love a show, if it be a merry one. Well, thou shalt be our houshold-Poet, for houshold-Chap|lains are now out of date like old Almanacks; every man can now say grace, and preach, and say prayers to themselves, or (which is better) forget to say any at all. Well, get thee in, prepare things fitting for the sacrifice. If this fellow had not good store of trades, he had missed of all preserment. VVell now, this Poet shall make ballads on all the hypo|cites of the town, he shall rime all the Ana|baptists out of their wits.

Enter Attorney, Tinker, Miller, Tailor, Shoomaker, c.

Att.
O that Plutus his eyes were scratcht out! J can have no more Fees for Latitats nor Outlawries.


Tink.
Nay, J am a Lad of metal, of all that but gold and silver, can make no profit of my brasse nor Latine: there's no need of making more holes then one now, and that's a wicked one for my neck to slip into.


Miller.
My double Toll fails me, O this grinds me to peece.


Tail.
O 'tis the worst stitch that was ever sowed with the needle of misfortune. O iron age, that like the Ostrich makes me feed on my own Goose!


Shoo.
O this false Cordwainer Plutus, that stretches the leather of my flesh on the Tree of fatality; that unmercifully puts me into the Stocks of adversity, and gives me no relief at the Last.


Tail.
Nay he has made me so slender, that I can measure me by my own Yard, three quarters quarter and half nail. This crosse-leg'd infelicity, sharper then my nee|dle, makes me eat my own Cabbage.


Shoo.
Nothing but a general insurrection like a shooing-horn can draw on help. Let us combine and patch together.


Om.
Agreed, agreed.

Exeum.
Enter Dull-pate solus.
It is a signe Plutus has lost his eyes, when Dull-pates grow rich: if my name had not been Dull-pate, I had lost half my prefer|ment. It is thought J have as many Ecclesi|astical Livings as Spalato had in England; Never a fat Benefice falls now adayes, but J catch it up; J can have 'um now without lustful Simony, in taking Bishops kinswomen ino the bargain. J have often wondred how it comes about that my head is so black, but the hairs of my chin gray: A merry fellow once told me, 'twas because I used my chops more then my brains. Tis true indeed, I fare well, because J was born under a rich Con|stellation,

but the learned sort under a poor Psanct. As for example, here comes the Pope, Iupiters Vicat.blesse thy wicked Holinesse! thou, the Devil, Cardinal Richliu, and the French faction at Court, have brought all the wars into England.
Enter Pope selus.

Pope.
VVho can instruct me which is Chremylus house?


Dul.

Grave reverend Father, 's the  with you?
How does your ?



Pop.

Ill as ill may ,
Since Plutus eye-sight is restored.



Dul.

VVhat is the cause of this your hea|vinesse:
Doth the proud Emperor refuse to kisse
Your sacred toe? or does it vex your Bonny|face
To lose your Peter-pence? what is the cause
Great catholique Bishop, Monarch of the Church,
The supreme Judge Ecclesiastical,
That you are thus perplext? why do you not curse m
VVith your Bell, Book, and Candle, that molest you?



Pop.

O J am dead with hunger, a saucy hunger,
VVith heresie as bad as Arrianisme,
Knawes on my sacred guts. J the great father
And Prince of Rome have not a crust,
Not a brown crust to knaw on. Iove's own Vicar,
Nay Iove himself on earth, would beg on knees
For one small peece of Sawsedge. This sad morn,
For a broil'd Sprat J paun'd my triple crown,
And now for one Red-herring will J morgage
All Peters large possessions.



Dul.

Aha great Pope, can your Pontifi|cial teeth
Be glad to gnaw upon a catholique Tripe?
Can your great metropolitan stomach feed
On a Hogs-cheek? 'tis strange, me thinks, that you
Being the universal Bishop, should not
Have one poor porredge-pot in all your Diocesse,
Never a soule in Limbo ready fryed?
Is all the Roast in Purgatory spent?
Are all your Bulls devoured? faith kill a Bull,
Good Pope, a Bull, to make your Holinesse Beef.
There must be meat somwhere or other sure,
Or can you open heaven  hell at pleasure;
And cannot Peters Keyes unlock the Cup|board?
VVhy sure our Ladies milk is not all spent,
No Reliques left, nor chips oth' Crosse to feed on?
Sure at  or t Compostella.
None of the Capuchins at Somersethouse
How can it be an't please your Holinesse?



Pop.

O no: since Plutus hath received his eyes,
Indulgencies are grown cheap,  at no price:
An absolution for a Rape made now
Is nothing worth.
Give me but one poor crust before J faint,
And J will canonize thee for a Saint.



Dul.

Or let me purchase for a Mutton|bone
Your Apostolical benediction.



Pop.

A messe of Broth or rib of Beef from thee,
n my esteem shall meritorious be.



Dul.

Nay J will have it more, such a donation
Shall be a work of supererogation.



Pop.
O how J thirst!


Dul.

M reverende Pater, cannot you drink a cup of Holy-water?
Now you that could drink Tyber dry, and more,
Cannot obtain a Jug upon the score.
Go try, they'll hardly trust you for a drop
At the Popes-head, Mitre, or Cadinals-Cap,
Or any place; tis mony draws the tap.



Pop.

So irreligious are these ages grown,
They think it charity to rob the Clergy.
How comes it that you dare with impudence
Deny the Priests their tithes?



Dul.

O, easily sir. A learned Antiquary

that has search't
The breech of Saturn for Antiquities;
Proves by a reason an infallible reason,
VVith bugle-horn writ in the Saxon tongue,
That neither praedial, nor personall tithes
Are due ex jure divino: and you know
The Clergie Bishops, your old quondam Pa|trons
Are voted down too, and ever since w'have learnt
A liberty of Conscience to pay no tithes.
We hear some teach too, they are An christian,
Like Steeple-houses; hence we learn to be
Too cunning now for your Apostolique See.



Pop.

Now worms devoure that Antiqua|ries nose,
And those that preach against all Steeple|houses;
That powre in papers half consumed with Mothes,
To prove some absurd opinions fain'd to be
Found in the wals of some old Nunnery,
But  my guts wish for a Benedicite!



Dull.

VVilt please your holinesse to call a Synod?
You may chance to catch trowt in the Coun|cel of Trent.



Pop.
O I do smel the scent of Pippn-pies.


Dull.

You do indeed, your Holinesse Nose I see,
Has the true spirit of Infallibility,
I finde you cannot erre. VVhat would you do,
To be of our house now to have free-quarter?



Pop.
I would resigne my right to heaven and hell.


Dull.

Ti-he-he, well said good Pope I|nocent.
But that's too much, resign your heaven only,
Retain your right to hell; your title there
Is held . VVell now,
Stay here a whil  sing a merry song
As we to Plutus go, and I will free
Thy guts from the Purgatory of fasting.


Enter Anus.

An.

Is this the Pope? Goddy godden good Father.
I do not come unto thy Holinesse
To beg a Licence to eat flesh on Fridaies;
But I desire thy Apostolical Curse
On a young man that has abused me grosly;
May it please thy Catholicknesse, the perjur'd Boy
Swore to lie with me while he lived, but he
Grown rich does think to buy out perjury.
Now good your Holinesse give him not abso|lution.



Pop.

VVould he were here; for three penee I could sell him
A gneral remission of his sins:
I am almost famisht for want of customers.



Dull.

Go woman, fetch the Quire in for sacrifice.
(But bid them bring no Copes nor Organs with them.)
And I will get his Holinesse to command him
To ly with thee this night what re come on't.
It is enjoyn'd him for his pennance is't not?



An.
It is an't please your Holinesse.


Pop.

Any thing shall please my holinesse, if you give me
But the least hopes to feed my Holinesse:
Tis a leane Holinesse, as the wold goes now.



Dull.

Tis strange that you, the Shepheard of all Europe,
Should not have one fat Lamb in all your flock.
What say, if I give you a leg of Mutton?



Pope
Remission of sins, whe ere they be.


Dull.
But what if I have sworn to give thee nothing?


Pope
My Holinesse shall give thee abso|lution.


Dull.
But I did but equivocate when I promised?


Pope
Ile free thee from all menall Reser|vation.


Dull.

But what if this same Mutton have gone through
Every Gyppo's hands?



Pope

I grant it lawfull:
I doe allow traditions.



Dull.
VVell then, I have Remission of all my sinnes.


Pope
VVith leave and pardon for all sins hereafter.


Dull.

VVhat ere they be; though I should ravish Nuns
Under the Altar?



Pop.
Tis a Venial sin.


Dull.
Or kill a King?


Pop.
Tis meritorious.


Dull.

Cuckold my Father, Whore my naturall Mother,
Grant the supremacy of the secular powers,
Be drunk at Masse, strip all the Feminine Saints
Into their Smocks, laugh at a Friars bald|crown,
Pisse in the Pixe, deny your mysteries,
Out-lie your Legend, get Pope Ioane with childe,
Eat flesh in Lent, sit off my Confessors Ears,
Or any sin, as great as your own Holinesse,
Or any of your Predecessors acted.



Pop.

A leg of Mutton wipes all sins away,
So good a deed will justifie.



Dull.
Swear then.


Pop.
I swear and grant it sub Sigillo Pis|catoris.


Dull.

A pox upon Sigillum Piscatoris,
Send it to Yarmouth, let it fish for Herrings.
Swear, J say, that is, kisse my Imperial shoe,
As Emperours do yours.



Pop.

J am Servus servorum, your servants servant.
Sans complement, like Ham.
O that this leather of thy shoe, this leather
Could be made flesh by Transubstantiation!
J would not only kisse but eat thy Toe.



Dull.

Moreover you shall swear that once a year
J shall have entire power to forgive sins
To my Comrades.



Pop.

As much as J my self:
J sweare and kisse your Holinesse toe.



Dull.

And that when J doe knock at hea|ven gates,
The Porter let me in for nothing. Swear a|gain.



Pop.
Again J swear, by this sweet kisse he shall.


Dull.

VVell, tis sufficient, J will pay your Ordinary. Enter Quire.
Here comes the Quire prepare your voice and sing.
The Round-heads will not come, cause the Pope's here.

To kisse the Nuns and all the Mulieribus.

VVhose best devotion tends unto his dinner:
One glasse of Sack or cup of nappy Alibus,
More vertue has then all our Decretalibus.

J had rather cat a meal then tell a story,
Of limbo patrum or of Purgatory:
No blessings like the pleasure of the Tastibus,
No reliques holier then the Venison Pastibus.



Om.
Benedixit, c.


Pop.

These are the Prayers, devotions and delighta's
Of Cardinals, Popes, Friars and Iesuita's.
Their break-fasts are their Mattins holy zelibus,
Their Vespertines are eating beef  velibus.

Come   sorores per praesentes,
Let us go in to exercise our dentes,
Where we will sit with you and your uxo|ribus,
To laugh at all these hungry auditoribus.

Act. 5. Scaen. ult.
Enter Plutus  a Letter.
I came into England but since this Parlia|ment sate, (the plunderers J thank them brought me hither) and J think J have had about 200000. suiters at least: nay, some great men have been ambitious to proffer me their daughters to marry. They indeed be

great ones, but J only look after Honesty now J have got my eye-sight. Never did gudgons at a mill-tail more greedily bite the bait, then some of 'um after me. Had J had th Palsie, Sciatica, Cough, Ague, Feaver, French pox, and a whole cart-load of diseases, (as J have the Gout already, because J am rich) they would have taken me with all my faults. England (J see) is a covetous place. This morning J have received no lesse then forty letters to the same purpose. Above all, one Mrs. Maria Corombona Butto Fuocco woes me; as sure as can be a Venetian  bred up in London, an arrant whore.  her Letter. A Plauto Gentilhomme d'Inghil|terra de bona gratia, Maria butta suoccae and so forth. A pox take her! J have forty more of them in my pocket. But there is one Mrs. Honesty Cleon, an honest Scriveners daughter, ('tis strange they have any thing to do with Honesty, J warrant she'll not live long) she is the mistresse of my affections, for she is honest. See here she comes.
Enter Mrs. Honesty.

Fair Lady, fairer then the morning-skies,
Hath not young Cupid toucht your amorous eyes?
I am all for golden Verses gratulation,
But must not passe by courteous salutation.

They kisse.

Hon.

Sir, if I may confesse, Loves art
No only toucht my eyes, but heart.



Plut.

Nay then the Parson straight shall do his part,
Let's in: the Gordian knot none can untwiss,
We'll tie it fast, and as we go we'll kisse.
Jn any state never will be foul weather,
When Honesty and Riches meet together.


Exeunt.






The Epilogue.

Old Wealth (you see) with Honesty and Piety
Is joyn'd in league for mutual society.
O would it were the blessing of our Nation,
They might have issue too by procreation!
But sure the Bride's past child-bearing; that's the reason
So few are honest in this age and season.
If't be a stollen match, Ptest must be taxt';
Tis certain true, the Banes were never ax't,
For he that joyn'd their hands (for ought I heare)
He was a very honest Cavalier;
He us'd the Ring and Book, went not by heart,
But joyn'd them word for word, Till death depart.
Full resolute, without Tes, to tye the noose:
I had lost his Benefice, h'had no move to lose.
I know there's many waggsh Pates joyne force
To part this couple by a sad divorce:
We hope't will not be granted by Petition
At th' Arches, Doctors Commons, or High-Commission:
 I do verily think there's  intent
To sever them by this our Parliament.
Therefore God give 'um joy! Ioy may they find!
This is the wish of every vertuous mind.
But wicked Rascals sing another Catch;
Pox take 'um hoth! Tis an unlucky match.
It is indeed for them, because 'twill serve
To send their Brats to Tyburn, or to sterve.
Welsh Parst y is good physick. Honest guests
We only bid to these our Nuptial feasts.
Offerings to th' rich are base: yet we demand
That you pay down a Plaudite at hand.

FINIS.
