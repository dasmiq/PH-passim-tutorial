THE
PUBLISHER
TO THE
READER
Concerning the following
LETTER.
Courteous Reader,
IT hath been usual with most of those who have Translated
this Author into any Language, to spend much of their
time and paper in taxing his impieties, and confuting his
errors and false principles as they are pleased to call them, if
upon perusal of his Writings I had found him guilty of any
thing that could deceive the simple, or prejudice the rest of
Mankind, I should not have put thee to the hazard of reading
him in thy own Language; but rather have suffered him still
to sleep in the obscurity of his own, than endanger the world;
but being very well assured of the contrary, and that the Age
will rather receive advantage than damage by this Publica|tion,
I did yet think that it was fit to say something in a Pre|face
to vindicate our Author from those Slanders which
Priests, and other byass'd Pens have laid upon him; but still
I thought, that it might prove a bold and presumptuous un|dertaking,
and might excite laughter, for a person of my
small parts and abilities, to Apologize for one of the greatest
Wits and profoundest Judgments that ever lived amongst
the Moderns: In this perplexity, I had the good fortune to
meet with this Letter of his own writing; which hath deli|vered
me from those scruples, and furnished me with an op|portunity
of justifying this great person by his own
Pen. Receive then this choice Piece with benignity,
it hath never before been published in any Language,
but lurk'd for above 80 years in the private Cabinets of his

own Kindred, and the Descendents of his own admirers in
Florence, till in the beginning of the Pontisicat of Vrbane the
8th. it was procured by the Jesuits and other busie-bodies,
and brought to Rome with an intention to divert that wise
Pope from his design of making one of Nicholas Machiavel's
Name and Family Cardinal, as (notwithstanding all their op|position)
he did, not long after. When it was gotten into that
City, it wanted not those who had the judgment and curi|osity
to copy it, and so at length came to enjoy that privi|ledge
which all rare Pieces (even the sharpest Libels and Pas|quils)
challenge in that Court, which is to be sold to Strangers,
one of which being a Gentleman of this Country, brought
it over with him at his return from thence in the year
1645. and having translated it into English, did communicate
it to divers of his friends, and by means of some of them, it
hath been my good fortune to be capable of making thee a
present of it, and let it serve as an Apology for our Author and
his Writings, if thou thinkest he need any. I must confess I be|lieve
his Works require little, but rather praise and admiration;
yet I wish I could as well justifie one undertaking of his
not long after the writing of this Letter; for we find in the
Story of those times, that in the Month of August following; in
the same year 1537. this Nicolo Machiavelli (except there were
another of that name) was committed Prisoner to the Bar|gello,
amongst those who were taken in Arms against Cosimo at
the Castle of Montemurli, notwithstanding all his Compli|ments
in this Letter to that Prince, and profess'd Obligations
to him; if this be so, we must impute it to his too great zeal,
to concur with the desires of the universality at that time, in
restoring the liberty of their Country, which hath so far da|zel'd
the judgments even of great and wise men, that thou
eest many grave Authors amongst the Ancients have even
commended and deified the ingratitude and Treachery of Bru|tus
and Cassius. But certainly this crime of his would have been
much more unpardonable, if he had lived to see his own Pro|phesie
fulfilled in the Persons and Descendents of this great Co|simo,
for there was never any succession of Princes since the
world began, in which all the Royal vertues and other qua|lities
necessary to those who rule over men, were more emi|nently
perspicuous than in every individual of this line; so
that those people have as little cause as ever any had to lament
the change of their Government; their great Dukes having
been truly Fathers of their Country, and treated their

Subjects like Children, though their power be above all
limitation, above all fundamental Laws; but they having no
Law, are a Law to themselves, I cannot chuse but instance in
some few of their benefits to their people, first the making the
River Arno Navigable from Pisa to Florence in a year of
Dearth, that so the Poor might be set on work and have
Bread, and the Traffick of both Cities infinitely facilitated,
their making at their own charge a Canal from Livorne to
Pisa, their erecting at Pisa a famous University, paying the
Professors, who are eminent for Learning, and discharging all
other incidencies out of their own Revenue, besides the rai|sing
stately Buildings for Schools and Libraries, their found|ing
a renowned Order of Knighthood, and keeping the Chap|ter
in the same City, and ordering a considerable number of
Knights constantly to reside there, both which were intended
and performed by them, to encrease the concourse, and restore
the wealth to the once opulent Inhabitants of that place. Their
new Building fortifying and enfranchizing Livorne, that even
by the abolishing their own Customs they might enrich their
Subjects; and make that Port (as it now is) the Magazine of
all the Levant Trade. And lastly, Their not having in 140
years ever levyed any new Tax upon their people, excepting
in the year 1642. to defend the Liberties of Italy against the
Barbarini. These things would merit a Panegyrick if either
my parts, or this short Advertisement would admit it, I shall
conclude then after I have born a just and dutiful testimony
to the merits of the Prince who now governs that State, in
whom (if all the Princely vertues and endowments should be
lost) they might be found and restored again to the world:
As some ingenious Artists in the last Age, retrieved the Art
of Sculpture by certain bas relievos remaining on some
Pillars and Walls at Rome; The Prudence, Magnanimi|ty,
Charity, Liberality, and above all the Humanity, Cour|tesie,
and Affability of this Prince, though they exceed my
expressions, yet they are sufficiently known, not only to his
own Subjects (the constant objects of his care and goodness)
but even to all Strangers, more particularly to our Nation, he
having undertaken a troublesome Journey to visit this King|dom,
and to make it witness and partaker of his transcendent
generosity and bounty, which he hath continued ever since,
as can be testified by all who have had the honour to wait
upon him in his own Country, or the good fortune but to
see him in ours. I my self who have been so happy to be ad|mitted

into his presence, and have been honoured since in
having his Highness my customer for many choice Books
to encrease (not his knowledge, for that is beyond receiving
any addition by Books) but his curiosity, and his Library, do
think my self bound in Duty to take this poor opportunity
of testifying my gratitude and devotion to this excellent
Prince. As to this Letter I have nothing more to say, but
that thou mayest see how right this Author was set in Prin|ciples
of Religion, before he could have the information,
which we have had since from the Pens of most learned and
rational Controversists in those points, and therefore thou
maist admire the sagacity of his Judgment. Read him then,
and serve God, thy King, and thy Country, with the know|ledge
he will teach thee. Farewel.





NICHOLAS MACHIAVEL'S
LETTER
TO
ZANOBIVS BVONDELMONTIVS
IN
VINDICATION
Of himself and His
WRITINGS.
THE Discourse we had lately (dear Zenobio) in the delightful Gardens of our
old deceased Friend Cosimo Rucellai, and the pressing importunity of Guilio
Salviati, that I would use some means to wipe off the Many aspersions
cast upon my Writings, gives you the present trouble of reading this
Letter, and me the pleasure of writing it; which last would be infinitely

greater, if I were not at this day too old, and too inconsiderable, and by the change of
our Government wholly uncapable of performing, either with my brain or my hand,
any further service to my Country; for it hath ever been my opinion, that whosoever
goes about to make men publickly acquainted with his actions, or apologize to the
world for imputatons laid upon him, cannot be excused from vanity and impertinence,
except his parts and opportunities be such, as may enable him to be instrumental for the
good of others, and that he cannot atchieve that excellent end, without justifying him|self
from having any indirect and base ones, and procuring trust from men, by clearing
the repute of his justice and integrity to them. But although this be far from my case;
yet I have yielded (you see) to the entreaty of Guilio and the rest of that Company,
not only because I am sufficiently (both by the restraint of our Press, and the discretion
of the person I write to) assured that this Letter will never be made publick; but for that
I esteem it a Duty to clear that excellent Society, from the Scandal of having so dangerous
and pernicious a person to be a member of their conversation; for by reason of my Age,
and since the loss of our Liberty, and my sufferings under that Monster of lust and cruelty
Alexander de Medeci, set over us by the Divine vengeance for our sins, I can be capable of
no other design or enjoyment, than to delight and be delighted in the company of so many
choice and virtuous persons, who now assemble themselves with all security, under the
happy and hopeful Reign of our new Prince, Cosimo, and we may say, that though our
Common-wealth be not restored, our slavery is at an end, and that he coming in by our
own choice, my prove (if I have as good Skill in Prophesying as I have had formerly)
Ancestor to many renowned Princes, who will govern this State in great quietness, and
with great clemency; so that our Posterity is like to enjoy case and security, though not
that greatness, wealth, and glory, by which our City hath for some years past (even in
the most factious and tumultuous times of our Democracy) given Law to Italy, and bridled
the ambition of foreign Princes, But, that I may avoid the Loquacity incident to old
men, I will come to the business. If I remember well, the exceptions that are taken to
these poor things I have published, are reducible to three.
First, That in all my Writings, I infinuate my great
affection to the Democratical Government, even so
much as to undervalue that of Monarchy in respect
of it, which last I do, not obscurely in many
passages, teach, and as it were, perswade the People
to throw off.
Next, That in some places I vent very great impie|ties,
slighting and villifying the Church, as Author
of all the misgovernment in the world, and by such
contempt make way for Atheism and Prophane|ness.
And Lastly, That in my Book of the Prince I teach
Monarchs all the execrable Villanies that can be

invented, and instruct them how to break faith,
and to oppress and enslave their Subjects.
I shall answer something to every one of these;
and that I may observe a right method, will
begin with the first.
Having lived in an Age when our poor Country and Government have suffered more
changes and revolutions, than ever did perhaps befall any people in so short a time, and
having had till the taking of Florence, my share in the managing of affairs, during almost
all these alterations, sometimes in the quality of Secretary of our City, and sometimes em|ployed
in Embassages abroad, I set my self to read the Histories of Ancient and Modern
times, that I might by that means find out whether there had not been in all Ages the like
vicissitudes and accidents in State affairs, and to search out the causes of them, and having
in some sort satisfied my self therein, I could not abstain from scribling something of the
too chief kinds of Government, Monarchy and Democracy, of which all other forms are
but mixtures, and since neither my Parts nor Learning could arrive to follow the steps of
the Ancients, by writing according to Method and Art, as Plato, Aristotle, and many
others have done upon this Subject, I did content my self to make slight observations upon
both; by giving a bare Character of a Prince, as to the Monarchical frame, and as to the
popular chusing the perfectest and most successful of all Governments of that kind upon
earth, and in my Discourses upon it, following the order of my Author, without ever
taking upon me to argue problematically, much less to decide which of these two Go|vrnments
is the best; if from my way of handling matters in my discourses upon Livy,
and from those incomparable virtues, and great Actions we read of in that History, and
from the observations I make, men will conclude (which is, I must confess my opinion)
that the excellency of those Counsels and Atchievements, and the improvement which
Mankind, and as I may so say, humane nature it self obtained amongst the Romans, did
proceed naturally from their Government, and was but a plain effect and consequence of
the perfection of their Common-wealth; I say if Readers will thus judge, how can I in
reason be accused for that; it would become those who lay this blame upon me to undeceive
them whom my Papers have missed, and to shew the world to what other causes we may
impute those admirable effects, those Heroick qualities and performance, that integrity
and purity of manners, that scorning of riches and life it self, when the publick was con|cerned:
If they please to do this, they will oblige my Readers, who will owe to such the
rectifying their Judgments, and not at all offend me, who have reasoned this matter im|partially
and without passion, nor have possitively affirmed any thing. But what if this
part of my accusation had been true? Why should I be condemned of Heresie or indiscre|tion
for preferring a Common-wealth before a Monarchy? was I not born, bred, and im|ployed
in a City, which being at the time I writ, under that form of Government, did owe
all wealth and greatness, and all prosperity to it? If I had not very designedly avoided all
dogmaticalness in my observations (being not willing to imitate young Scholars in ther
Declamations) I might easily have concluded from the premises I lay down, that a De|mocracy
founded upon good orders is the best and most excellent Government, and this
without the least fear of confutation; for I firmly believe, that there are none but Flatte|rers
and Sophisters would oppose me, such as will rest Aristotle, and even Plato himself,
to make them write for Monarchy, by misapplying some loose passages in those great Authors,
nay, they will tell their Readers, that what is most like the Government of the world by
God is the best, which wholly depends upon his absolute power; to make this comparison
run with four feet, these Sycophants must give the poor Prince they intend to diefie, a
better and superior Nature to humanity, must create a necessary dependance of all Creatures
upon him, must endow him with infinite wisdom and goodness, and even with omnipo|tency
it self. It will be hard for any man to be misled in this Argument by proofs wresled

from Theology, since whosoever reads attentively the Historical part of the Old Testament,
shall find that God himself never made but one Government for men, that this Govern|ment
was a Common-wealth (wherein the Sanhadrim or Senate, and the Congegation or
popular Assembly had their share) and that he manifested his high displeasure when the
rebellious people would turn it into a Monarchy; but that I may not strike upon the rock
I profess to shun, I shall pass to that which is indeed it to be wip'd off, and which if it were
true, would not only justly expose me to the hatred and vengeance of God, and all good
men, but even destroy the design and purpose of all my Writings, which is to treat in some
sort (as well as one of my small parts can hope to do) of the Politicks; and how can
any man pretend to write concerning Policy, who destroys the most essential part of it,
which is obedience to all Governments. It will be very easie then for Guilio Salviati, or
any other member of our Society, to believe the Protestation I make, that the animating
of private men either directly or indirectly to disobey, much less to shake off, any Govern|ment
how despotical soever, was never in my Thoughts or Writings; those who are
unwilling to give credit to this, may take the pains to assign in any of my Books, the pas|sages
they imagine to tend that way, (for I can think of none my self) that so I may give
such person more particular satisfaction; I must coness I have a discourse in one of my
Books, to encourage the Italian Nation, to assume their ancient valour, and to expel
the Barbarians, meaning (as the ancient Romans used the word) all Strangers from
amongst us; but that was before the Kings of Spain had quiet possession of the Kingdom
of Naples, or the Emperor of the Dutchy of Milan; so that I could not be interpreted
to mean that the people of those two Dominions should be stir'd up to shake off their
Princes, because they were Foreigners, since at that time Lodovic Sforza was in possession
of the one, and K. Frederick restored to the other, both Natives of Italy; but my design was
to exhort our Country-men not to suffer this Province to be the Scene of the Arms and am|bition
of Charles the 8th. or K. Lewis his Successor, who when they had a mind to renew
the old Title of the House of Anjou to the Kingdom of Naples, came with such force
into Italy, that not only our Goods were plundered, and our Lands wasted, but even the
liberty of our Cities and Governments endangered, but to unite and oppose them,
and to keep this Province in the hands of Princes of our own Nation, this my intention is
so visible in the Chapter it sel, that I need but refer you to it. Yet that I may not answer
this imputation barely by denying, I shall assert in this place what my principles are in
that which the world calls Rebellion, which I believe to be not only rising in Arms
against any Government we live under, but to acknowledge that word to extend to all
clandestine Conspiracies too, by which the peace and quiet of any Country may be inte|rupted,
and by consequence the Lives and Estates of innocent persons endangered. Rebel|lion
then so described, I hold to be the greatest crime that can be committed amongst men,
both against Policy, Morality, and in foro Conscientiae; but notwithstanding all this, it is
an offence which will be committed whilst the world lasts, as often as Princes tyranize, and
by enslaving and oppressing their Subjects make Magistracy, which was intended for the
benefit of Mankind, prove a Plague and Destruction to it; for let the terrour and the guilt
be never so great, it is impossible that humane Nature, which consists of passion as well as
virtue can support with patience and submission the greatest cruelty and injustice, when|ever
either the weakness of their Princes, the unanimity of the people, or any other
favourable accident, shall give them reasonable hopes to mend their condition, and provide
better for their own interest by insurrection. So that Princes and States ought in the Con|duct
of their Affairs, not only to consider what their people are bound to submit to, if they
were inspired from Heaven, or were all Moral Philosophers, but to weigh likewise what is
probable de facto to fall out, in this corrupt age of the world, and to reflect upon those
dangerous Tumults, which have happened frequently not only upon oppression, but even
by reason of Malversation, and how some Monarchies have been wholly subverted and
changed into Democracies by the Tyranny of their Princes, as we see (to say nothing of
Rome) the powerful Cantons of Swisserland brought by that means a little before the last
age, to a considerable Common-wealth, Courted and sought to by all the Potentates in
Christendom. If Princes will seriously consider this matter, I make no question but they
will Rule with Clemency and Moderation, and return to that excellent Maxim of the
Ancients (almost exploded in this Age) that the interest of Kings, and of their people is
the same, which truth it hath been the whole design of my Writings to convince
them of.

I am charged then, in the second place, with impiety, in villifying the Church, and so
to make way for Atheism. I do not deny but that I have very frequently in my Writings,
laid the blame upon the Church of Rome, not only for all the misgovernment of Christen|dom;
but even for the depravation and almost total destruction of Christian Religion it
self in this Province; but that this Discourse of mine doth, or can tend to teach men
impiety; or to make way for Atheism, I peremptorily deny: and although for proof of
my innocence herein, I need but refer you and all others to my Papers themselves, as
they are now published (where you will find all my reasons drawn from experience, and
frequent examples cited, which is ever my way of arguing) yet since I am put upon it,
I shall in a few lines make that matter possibly a little clearer; and shall first make protesta|tion,
that as I do undoubtedly hope, by the merits of Christ, and by Faith in him, to
attain eternal Salvation; so I do firmly believe the Christian profession to be the only true
Religion now in the world: Next, I am fully persuaded, that all Divine verities, which
God then designed to teach the world, are contained in the Books of Holy Scripture, as
they are now extant and received amongst us. From them I understand that God created
man in purity and innocence, and that the first of that Species, by their frailty, lost at once
their integrity and their Paradise, and intal'd sin and misery upon their posterity; that Al|mighty
God to repair this loss, did out of his infinite mercy, and with unparallel'd grace
and goodness, send his only begotten Son into the world, to teach us , to be a
perfect example of virtue, goodness, and obedience, to restore true Religion, degenerated
amongst the Iews into Superstition, Formality, and  for the salvation
of Mankind, and in sine, to give to us the Holy Spirit, to regenerate our Hearts, support
our Faith, and lead us into all Truth. Now if it shall appear, that as the lusts of our first
Parens did at that time disappoint the good intention of God, in making a pure world,
and brought in by their disobedience the corruptions that are now in it; so that since like|wise
the Bishops of Rome, by their insatiable ambition and avarice, have designedly, as
much as in them lies, frustrated the merciful purpose he had, in the happy restauration he
intended the world by his Son, and in the renewing and reforming of humane Na|ture,
and have wholly defaced and spoil'd Christian Religion, and made it a worldly and
a Heathenish thing; and altogether uncapable, as it is practised amongst them, either
of directing the ways of its Professors to virtue and good life, or of saving thus Souls
hereafter. If, I say, this do appear I know no reason why I, for detecting thus much,
and for giving warning to the world to take heed of their ways, should be accused of Im|piety
or Atheism, or why his Holyness should be so inraged against the poor Inhabitants of
the Valleys in Savoy, and against the Albigesi for calling him Antichrist; but to find that
this is an undoubted truth, I mean that the Popes have corrupted Christian Religion, we
need but read the New Testament (acknowledged by themselves to be of infallible truth)
and there we shall see, that the Faith and Religion Preach'd by Christ, and setled after|wards
by his Apostles, and cultivated by their Sacred Epistles, is so different a thing from
the Christianity that is now profess'd and taught at Rome, that we should be convinc'd,
that if those Holy men should be sent by God again into the world, they would take more
pains to confute this Gallimaufry, than ever they did to Preach down the Tradition of the
Pharisees, or the Fables and Idolatry of the Gentiles, and would in probability suffer a
new Martyrdom in that City under the Vicar of Christ, for the same Doctrine which
once animated the Heathen Tyrants against them. Nay, we have something more to say
against these Sacrilegious pretenders to Gods power; for whereas all other false worships
have been set up by some politick Legislators, for the support and preservation of Go|vernment,
this false, this spurious Religion brought in upon the ruines of Christianity by
the Popes, hath deformed the face of Government in Europe, destroying all the good
principles, and Morality left us by the Heathen themselves, and introduced instead
thereof, Sordid, Cowardly, and impolitick Notions, whereby they have subjected Man|kind,
and even great Princes and States, to their own Empire, and never suffered any
Orders of Maxims to take place where they have power, that might make a Nation
Wise, Honest, Great or Wealthy; this I have set down so plainly in those passages of my
Book which are complained of, that I shall say nothing at all for the proof of it in this
place, but refer you thither, and come to speak a little more particularly of my first asser|tion,
that the Pope and his Clergy have depraved Christian Religion. Upon this subject I
could infinitely wish, now Letters begin to revive again, that some Learned Pen would
employ it self, and that some person vers'd in the Chronology of the Church (as they
call it) would deduce out of the Ecclesiastical Writers, the time and manner how these
abuses crept in, and by what arts and Steps this Babel that reaches at Heaven, was built by
these Sons of the Earth; but this matter as unsuitable to the brevity of a Letter, and in|deed

more to my small parts and Learning, I shall not pretend to, being one who never
hitherto studied or writ of Theology, further than it did naturally concern the Politicks;
therefore I shall only deal by the New Tesament as I have done formerly by Titus Livius;
that is, make observations or reflections upon it, and leave you and Mr. Guilio, and the rest of
our Society to make the judgment, not citing like Preachers, the Chapter or Verse; because
the reading of Holy Scripture is little us'd, and indeed hardly permitted amongst us.
To begin at the top, I would have any reasonable man tell me, whence this unmeasurable
power, long claim'd, and now possess'd by the Bishop of Rome, is derived, first of being
Christ's Vicar, and by that (as I may so say) pretending to a Monopoly of the Holy
Spirit (which was promised and given to the whole Church, that is, to the Elect or Saints)
as is plain by a Clause in St. Peter's Sermon, made the very same time that the miraculous
gifts of the Spirit of God were first given to the Apostles, who says to the Iews and
Gentiles; Repent and be Baptized every one of you in the name of Iesus Christ for the
remission of Sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, for this promise is to you
and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call,
Next, to judge infallibly of Divine Truth, and to forgive Sins as Christ did. Then to be the
Head of all Ecclesiastical persons and causes in the world; to be so far above Kings and
Princes, as to Judge, Depose, and deprive them, and to have an absolue jurisdiction over
all the Affairs in Christendom, in Ordine ad Spiritualia; yet all this the Canonists allow
him, and he makes no scruple to assume, whilst it is plain that in the whole New Testa|ment
there is no description made of such an Officer to be at any time in the Church, except
it be in the Prophecy of the Apocalyps, or in one of St. Paul's Epistles, where he says,
who it is that shall sit in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. Christ tells
us his Kingdom is not of this world, and if any will be the greatest amongst his Disciples,
that he must be servant to the rest, which shews that his followers were to be great in sancti|ty
and humility, and not in worldly power.
The Apostle Paul writing to the Christians of those times; almost in every Epistle com|mands
them to be obedient to the higher Powers, or Magistrates set over them, and St. Peter
himself (from whom this extravagant Empire is pretended to be derived) in his firs
Epistle, bids us submit our selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether
it be to the King, or, c. and this is enjoyn'd although it is plain, that they who govern'd
the world in those days, were both Heathen, Tyrants, and Usurpers, and in this submis|sion
there is no exception or proviso for Ecclesiastical immunity. The practice as well as
Precepts of these Holy men shews plainly that they had no intention to leave Successors,
who should deprive Hereditary Princes from their right of Reigning for differing in Reli|gion,
who without all doubt are by the appointment of the Apostle, and by the principles
of Christianity, to be obeyed and submitted to (in things wherein the fundamental Laws
of the Government give them power) though they were Iews or Gentiles. If I should
tell you by what Texts in Scripture the Popes claim the Powers before mentioned, it would
stir up your laughter, and prove too light for so serious a matter; yet because possibly you
may never have heard so much of this Subject before, I shall instance in a few: They tell
you therefore that the Jurisdiction they pretend over the Church, and the power of par|doning
Sins, comes from Christ to St. Peter, and from him to them. Thou art Peter, and
upon this Rock I will build my Church. I will give thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven;
whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt
loose on Earth, c. From these two Texts ridiculously applyed, comes this great Tree
which hath with its Branches over-spread the whole Earth, and kill'd all the good and
wholsom Plants growing upon it; The first Text will never by any man of sence be un|derstood
to say more, than that the Preaching, Suffering, and Ministry of Peter, was like
to be a great foundation and Pillar of the Doctrine of Christ; the other Text (as also
another spoken by our Saviour to all his Apostles, whose sins ye remit they are remit|ted,
and whose sins ye retain they are retained) are by all the Primitive fathers interpreted
in this manner, wheresoever you shall effectually Preach the Gospel, you shall carry with
you Grace, and Remission of Sins to them which shall follow your instructions; but the peo|ple
who shall not have these joyful Tidings communicated by you to them, shall remain in
darkness, and in their Sins. But if any will contest, that by some of these last Texts, that
Evangelical Excommunication, which was afterwards brought into the Church by the
Apostles, was here praesignified by our great Master, how unlike were those censures to
those now thundered out (as he calls it) by the Pope? these were for edification, and not
destruction, to afflict the flesh for the salvation of the Soul; that Apostolical ordinance
was pronounced for some notorious Scandal or Apostacy from the Faith, and first decreed
by the Church; that is, the whole Congregation present, and then denounced by the

Pastor, and reached only to debar such person from partaking of the Communion or
fellowship of that Church, till repentance should readmit him, but was followed by no
other prosecution or chastisement, as is now practised. But suppose all these Texts had
been as they would have them, how does this make for the Successors of St. Peter or the
rest? or how can this prove the Bishops of Rome to have right to such succession? But I
make haste from this subject, and shall urge but one Text more; which is The spiritual
man judgeth all men, but is himself judged of none; from whence is inferred by the Cano|nists,
that first, the Pope is the Spiritual man; and then, that he is to be Judge of all the
world, and last, that he is never to be liable to any judgment himself; whereas it is ob|vious
to the meanest understanding, St. Paul in this Text means to distinguish between
a person inspired with the Spirit of God, and one remaining in the state of Nature, which
latter he says cannot judge of those Heavenly gifts and graces, as he explains himself
when he says, The Natural man cannot discern the things of the Spirit, because they are
foolishness unto him. To take my leave of this matter wholly out of the way of my Stu|dies,
I shall beg of you Zenobio and of Guilio, and the rest of our Society to read over
carefully the new Tesament, and then to see what ground there is for Purgatory (by
which all the wealth and greatness hath accrew'd to these men) what colour for the Ido|latrous
worship of Saints, and their Images and particularly for speaking in their hymns
and prayers to a piece of wood (the Cross I mean) Slve Lignum c. and then fac nos
dignos beneficiorum Christi, as you may read in that Office, what colour, or rather what ex|cuse
for that horrid unchristian, and barbarous Engine called the inquisition, brought in
by the command and authority of the Pope, the Inventor of which, Peter a Dominican
Fryer having been slain amongst the Albigesi, as he well deserved, is now Cannoniz'd for a
Saint, and stil'd San Pietro Martine: In the dreadfull Prisons of this Inquisition, many
faithful and pious Christians (to say nothing of honest Moral Moors or Mahometans) are
tormented and famish'd, or, if they out-live their sufferings burnt publickly to death, and
that only for differing in Religion from the Pope, without having any crime, or the least
misdemeanor proved or alledged against them, and this is inflicted upon these poor Crea|tures,
by those who profess to believe the Scripture, which tells us, that faith is the gift of
God, without whose special illumination no man can obtain it, and therefore is not in rea|son
or humanity to be punished for wanting it: And Christ himself hath so clearly decided
that point in bidding us let the tares and the wheat grow together till the Harvest, that I
shall never make any difficulty to call him Antichrist, who shall use the least persecution
whatsoever against any diering in matters of faith from himself, whether the person so
dissenting, be Heretick, Iew, Gentile, or Mahometan: Next, I beseech you to observe
in reading that Holy Book (though Christian fasts are doubtless of Divine right) what
ground there is for enjoying fish to be eaten (at least flesh to be abstained from) for one
third part of the year, by which they put the poor to great hardship, who not having
purses to buy wholsom fish, are sujected to all the miseries and diseases incident to a bad
and unhealthfull dyet, whilst the rich, and chiefly themselves and their Cardinals, exceed
Lucullus in their Luxury, of Oysters, Turbats, tender Crabs, and Carpioni brought some
hundreds of miles to feed their gluttony, upon these penitential days of abstinence from
Beef and Pork. It may be it will lye in the way of those who observe this, to enquire
what St. Paul means when he says That in the latter days some shall depart from the faith
forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to be
received with thanksgiving; but all these things, and many other abuses brought in by
these Perverters of Christianity, will I hope e're long be enquired into by some of the
Disciples of that bold Fryer, who the very same year in which I prophecyed that the
scourge of the Church was not far off, began to thunder against their Indulgencies, and
since hath questioned many tenets long received and imposed upon the world. I shall
conclude this discourse after I have said a word of the most Hellish of all the innovations
brought in by the Popes, which is the Clergy; these are a sort of men under pretence of
ministring to the people in holy things, set a part and seperated from the rest of mankind
(from whom they have a very distinct, and a very opposite interest) by a humane Cere|mony
called by a divine nam, viz. Ordination, these wherever they are found (with the
whole body of the Monks and Fryers, who are called the regular Clergy) make a Band
which may be called the Ianizaries of the Papacy, these have been the causers of all the
Soloecisms and immortalities in Government, and of all the impieties and abominations in
Religion, and by consequence of all the disorder, villany, and coruption we suffer un|der
in this detestable Age,; these men by the Bishop of Rome's help, have crept into all the
Governments in Christendom, where there is any mixture of Monarchy, and made them|selves
a third estate; that is, have, by their temporalitis (which are almost a third part

of all the Lands in Europe given them by the blind zeal, or rather folly of the Northern
people, who over-ran this part of the world) stept into the throne, and what they cannot
perform by these secular helps, and by the dependancy their vassals have upon them, they
fail not to claim and to usurp, by the power they pretend to have from God and his Vice|gerent
at Rome. They exempt themselves, their Lands and goods from all secular
jurisdiction; that is, from all Courts of Justice and Magistracy, and will be Judges in their
own Causes, as in matters of tithe, c. and not content with this, will appoint Courts of
their own to decide Soveraignly in testamentary matters, and many other causes, and take
upon them to be sole Punishers of many great Crimes, as Witchcraft, Sorcery, Adul|tery,
and all uncleanness; to say nothing of the fore-mentioned judicatory of the Inqui|sition:
in these last cases they turn the offenders over to be punish'd (when they have given
Sentence) by the secular arm, so they call the Magistrate, who is blindly to execute
their decrees under pain of Hell fire; as if Christian Princes and Governours were ap|pointed
only by God to be their Bravo's or Hangmen. They give Protection and San|ctuary,
to all execrable offenders, even to Murderers themselves (whom God commanded
to be indispensably punish'd with death) if they come within their Churches, Cloysters, or
any other place, which they will please to call Holy ground; and if the ordinary justice,
nay, the Soveraign power, do proceed against such offender, they thunder out their Ex|communication;
that is, cut off from the body of Christ, not the Prince only, but
the whole Nation and People, shutting the Church doors, and commanding divine offices
to cease, and sometimes even authorizing the people to rise up in Arms, and constrain
their Governours to a submission, as happened to this poor City in the time of our An|cestors,
when for but forbidding the servant of a poor Carmelite Fryer (who had vowed
poverty, and should have kept none) to g arm'd, and punishing his disobedience with
imprisonment, our whole Senate with their Gonfalonier were constrained to go to Avignon
for absolution, and in case of refusal, had been massacred by the people. It would almost
astonish a wise man to imagine how these folks should acquire an Empire so distructive
to Christian Religion, and so pernicious to the interests of men, but it will not seem so
miraculous to them who shall seriously consider, that the Clergy hath been for more than
this thousand years upon the catch, and a form'd united corporation against the purity of
Religion, and the interest of mankind, and have not only wrested the Holy Scriptures to
their own advantage (which they have kept from the laity in unknown languages, and
by prohibiting the reading thereof) but made use likewise first of the blind devotion and
ignorance of the Goths, Vandals, Huns, c. and since of the ambition and avarice of
Christian Princes, stirring them up one against another, and sending them upon foolish
errands to the Holy Land, to lose their lives, and to leave their Dominions, in the mean
time, exposed to themselves and their Complices. They have besides kept Learning and
Knowledge among themselves, stifling the light of the Gospel, crying down Moral vir|tues
as splendid sins, defacing humane policy, destroying the purity of the Chistian faith
and profession, and all that was vertuous, prudent, regular and orderly upon earth; so that
whoever would do good, and good men service, get himself immortal honour in this
life, and eternal glory in the next, would restore the good policy (I had almost said with
my Author Livy the sanctity too) of the Heathens, with all their valour, and other glo|rious
endowments; I say, whoever would do this, must make himself powerful enough
to extirpate this cursed and apostate race out of the world, and that you may see this is
lawful as well as necessary, I shall say but one word of their calling and original, and
then leave this subject. The word Clergy is a term, wholly unknown to the Scriptures,
otherwise than in this sence; a peculiar People or Gods lot, used often for the whole
Jewish Nation, who are likewise called a Kingdom of Priests in some places. In the
New Testament the word Cleros is taken for the true Believers, who are also called the
Elect, and often the Church, which is the Assembly of the faithful met together, as is
easily seen by reading the beginning of most of St. Paul's Epistles, where writing to the
Church, or Churches, he usually explains himself, To all the Saints in Christ; sometimes, To
all who have obtained like faith with us; sometimes, To all who in all places call upon the Name
of the Lord Iesus, c. by which it appears, that neither the word Church nor Clergy was
in those days ever appropriated to the Pastors or Elders of the flock; but did signifie indiffe|rently
all the people assembled together; which is likewise the literal construction of the
word Ecclesia, which is an assembly or meeting; in these Congregations or Churches was
performed their Ordination, which properly signifies no more than a decree of such As|sembly;
but is particularly used for an Election of any into the Ministery. The manner
was this, sometimes the Apostles themselves in their Perigrinations, and sometimes any
other eminent Member of the Church, did propose to the Society (upon vacancy, or

other necessity of a Pastor, Elder, or Deacon) some good Holy man to be Elected, which
person is he had parts or gifts, such as the Church could edifie by, was chosen by the
lifting up of hands, that is by suffrage, and oftentimes hands were laid upon him, and
Prayer made for him. These men so set apart did not pretend to any consecration, or
sacredness more than they had before, much less to become a distinct thing from the rest
of mankind, as if they had been metamorphos'd, but did attend to perform the several
functions of their calling, as prophecying; that is, Preaching the Gospel, visiting
the sick, c. and never intermitted the ordinary business of their Trade or Profession,
unless their Church or Congregation was very numerous, in which case they were main|tained
by alms or contribution, which was laid aside by every member, and collected the
first day of the week by the Deacons, this was said to be given to the Church, and was
imployed by suffrage of the whole Collective Body to the poor, and to other incidencies,
so far was it from Sacriledge in those days to employ Church goods to Lay uses. From
these words, Church, Clergy, Ordination, Pastor, (which last hath been translated of late
years Bishop) you see what conclusions these men have deduced, and how immense a stru|cture
they have raised, upon so little a foundation, and how easily it will fall to the
ground, when God shall inspire Christian Princes and States to redeem his truths, and his
poor enslaved Members out of their Clutches, to bring back again into the world, the
true original Christian faith, with the Apostolical Churches, Pastors, and Ordination, so
consistent with moral virtue and integrity, so helpful and conducing to the best and most
prudent Policy, so fitted for obedience to Magistracy and Government, all which the world
hath for many years been deprived of, by the execrable and innate ill quality, which is in|seperable
from Priest-craft, and the conjuration or spell of their new invented ordination;
by which they cry with the Poet,
Iam furor humanum nostro de pectore sensum
Expulit  totum spirant praecordia Phoebum.
Which makes them so Sacred, and Holy, that they have nothing of integrity, or indeed
of humanity left in them. I hope I shall not be thought impious any longer, upon this
point, I mean for vindicating Christian Religion from the assaults of these men, who
having the confidence to believe, or at least profess themselves the only instruments which
God hath chosen or can choose to teach and reform the world (though they have neither
Moral virtues, nor Natural parts equal to other men for the most part) have by this pre|tence
prevail'd so far upon the common sort of people, and upon some too of a better
quality, that they are perswaded their salvation or eternal damnation depends upon
believing or not believing of what they say. I would not be understood, to disswade
any from honouring the true Apostolical Teachers, when they shall be re-established
amongst us, or from allowing them (even of right, and not of alms or curtesie) such
emoluments as may enable them cheerfully to perform the duties of their charge, to
provide for their Children, and even to use hospitality as they are commanded by St. Paul.
But this I will prophesie before I conclude, that if Princes shall perfom this business by
halves, and leave any root of this Clergy or Priest-craft, as it now is, in the ground; or
if that famous reformer, fled some years since out of Picardy to Geneva, who is of so great
renown for learning and parts, and who promises us so perfect a reformation, shall not
in his model wholly extirpate this sort of men, then I say I must foretel, that as well the
Magistrate as this Workman, will find themselves deceived in their expectation, and
that the least fibra of this plant will over-run again the whole Vineyard of the Lord, and
turn to a diffusive Papacy in every Diocess, perhaps in every Parish: So that God in his
mercy inspire them to cut out the core of the Ulcer, and the bag of this imposture, that
it may never ranckle or fester any more, nor break out hereafter, to diffuse new corruption
and putrifaction through the body of Christ, which is his Holy Church, nor to vitiate
and infect the good order and true policy of Government.
I come now to the last branch of my charge, which is, that I teach Princes villany, and
how to enslave and oppress their Subjects, in which accusation I am dealt with as poor
Agnollo Canini was, who, as they report, being a very learned Practiser of the Laws, and left
the only man of this profession (one Autumn) in our City, the rest of the Advocates being
fled into the Country for fear of a contagious Disease which then reigned, was comman|ded
by our Judges to assist with his Counsel both parties, and to draw Pleas as well for the
Defendant as the Plantiff, else the Courts of Justice must have been shut up. In the same
manner my accusers handle me, and make me first exhort and teach Subjects to throw off
their Princes, and then to instruct Monarchs how to enslave and oppress them; but I did

not expect such ingratitude from mine own Citizens, or to beserved as Moses was, when
he was upbraided for killing the Egyptian, by one of his own people for whose sake he had
done it, whereas he believed they would have understood by that action, that he was the
person whom God intended to make use of in delivering them from the horrid slavery
they were then under. If any man will read over my Book of the Prince with impartia|lity
and ordinary charity, he will easily perceive, that it is not my intention therein to
recommend that Government, or those men there described, to the world; much less to
teach them to trample upon good men, and all that is sacred and venerable upon earth,
Laws, Religion, Honesty, and what not; if I have been a little too punctual in designing
these Monsters, and drawn them to the life in all their lineaments and colours, I hope
mankind will know them the better to avoid them, my Treatise being both a Satyr against
them, and a true Character of them; I speak nothing of great and honourable Princes,
as the Kings of France, England, and others, who have the States and Orders of their
Kingdoms with excellent Laws and Constitution to found and maintain their Govern|ment,
and who reign over the hearts as well as the persons of their subjects; I treat
only of those vermin bred out of the corruption of our own small Common-wealths and
Cities, or engender'd by the ill blasts that come from Rome, Olivaretto da Fermo, Borgia,
the Baglioni, the Bentivoglii, and a hundred others; who having had neither right nor
honourable means to bring them to their power, use it with more violence, rapine, and
cruelty upon the poor people, than those other renowned Princes shew to the Boars, the
Wolves, the Foxes, and other savage beasts which are the objects of their chase and
hunting: whosoever in his Empire over men is ty'd to no other rules than those of his
own will and lust, must either be a Saint to moderate his passions, or else a very Devill in|carnate;
or if he be neither of these, both his life and reign are like to be very short; for
whosoever takes upon him so execrable an employment as to rule men against the Laws of nature
and of reason, must turn all topsie turvy, and never stick at any thing,
for if once he halt, he will fall and never rise again: I hope after this I
need say little to justifie my self from the calumny of advising these Monsters to break their
faith, since to keep it is to lose their Empire, faithfulness and sincerity being their mortal
enemies, an Ugucceone della Faggivola to one who upbraided him, that he never employed
honest men; answered, Honest men will cut my throat, let the King use honest men, mean|ing
the King of Naples, who was established in his Throne, and had right to it, But that
I may have occasion to justifie my self against a little more than I am accused of, I will con|fess,
that in a work where I desired to be a little more serious, than I was in this Book of
the Prince, I did affirm, that in what way soever men defended their Country, whether
by breaking or keeping their faith, it was ever well defended, not meaning in a strict mo|ral
sence, or point of honour, but explaining my self that de facto the infamy of the
breach of word, would quickly be forgoten and pardoned by the world, which is very
true, Nay, what if I had said that good success in any interprize (a far less cosideration
than Piety to our Country) would have cancell'd the blame of such perfidy as Caesar
(whom I compare to Cataline) us'd toward his fellow-Citizen, not only nor detested by
posterity, but even crown'd with renown and immortal fame; insomuch as Princes to this
day (as I have observed elsewhere) think it an honour to be compared to him, and the
highest pitch of veneration their flatterers can arrive at, is to call them by the name of one
who violated his faith, and enslav'd his Country. I hope that in shewing as well these
Tyrants as the poor people who are forced to live under them, their danger, that is by lay|ing
before the former, the hellish and precipitous courses they must use to maintain their
power, by representing to the latter, what they must suffer, I may be instrumental, first,
to deter private Citizens from attempting upon the liberties of their Country, or if they
have done it, to make them lay down their ill gotten authority; and then to warn the rest
of the Nobility and people, from these factions and malignancies in their several common-wealths
and Governments, which might give hope and opportunity to those who are am|bitious
amongst them, to aspire to an Empire over them. However it prove, I hope I am
no more to be blamed for my attempt, then that excellent Physician of our Nation is, who
hath lately taken so much pains to compose an excellent Treatise, of that foul Disease
which was, not long since, brought from the new world into these parts; wherein though
he be forced to use such expressions as are almost able to nauseate his Readers, and talk of
such Ulcers, Boyls, Nodes, Botches, Cankers c. that are scarce fit to be repeated,
especially when he handles the causes of those effects, yet he did not intend to teach or ex|hort
men to get this Disease; much less did he bring this lamentable infirmity into the
world, but describes it faithfully as it is, to the end men may be bettered, and avoid the
being infected with it, and may discern and cure it, whenever their incontinence and folly
shall procure it them. I shall say no more in this mattr; but to conclude all make a pro|testation,

that as well in this Book, as in all my other Writings, my only scope and design
is to promote the interest and welfare of mankind, and the peace and quiet of the world,
both which I am so vain as to believe, would be better obtained and provided for, if the
principles I lay down were followed and observed hy Princes and People, than they are
like to be by those Maxims which are in this Age most in vogue. For my self I shall only
say (and call you all to witness for the truth of it) that as by my Birth I am a Gentleman,
and of a Family which hath had many Gonfaloniers of Justice in it;Chief Magi|strate. so I have been used in
many employments of great trust, both in our City and abroad, and at this hour I am not
in my Estate one peny the better for them all, nor should I have been, although I had never
suffered any losses by the seisure of my Estate in the year 1531. for my carriage it hath ever
been void of faction and contention; I never had any prejudice against the House of Me|dici,
but honoured the persons of all those of that Family whom I knew, and the memory
of such of them as lived before me, whom I acknowledge to have been excellent Patriots
and Pillars of our City and Common-wealth. During the turbulent times of Piero, and
after his expulsion out of Florence, though my employments were but Ministerial, my ad|vice
was ask'd in many grave matters, which I ever delivered with impartiality and indif|ference,
not espousing the heady opinions of any, much less their passions and animosities;
I never sided with any Party further than that the Duty of my charge obliged me to serve
the prevailing Party, when posses'd of the Government of our City; this I speak for
those changes which happened between the flight of the said Piero de Medici, and the horrid
Parricide commited by Clement the 7th. upon his indulgent Mother, joyning with his
greatest enemies, and uniting himself with those who had used the most transcendent in|solence
to his own person, and the highest violence and fury the Sun ever saw to his poor
Courtiers and Subjects, that so accompanied he might sheath his Sword in the bowels of
his own desolate Country. At that time, and during that whole Seige, I must confess I
did break the consines of my Nutrality, and not only acted as I was commanded barely,
but rouz'd my self, and stir'd up others haraunging (in the Streets places of the City)
the People to defend with the last drop of their blood, the Walls of their Country. and
the Liberty of their Government; taking very hazardous Journey to Ferruccio, and then
into the Mugello and other parts, to bring in Succours and Provisions to our languishing
City; and acting as a Soldier (which was a new profession to me) at the age of above
sixty, when others are dispensed from it. For all which, I had so entire a satisfaction
in my mind and conscience, that I am perswaded this cordial made me able to support the
sufferings which befell me after our Catastrophe, and to rejoyce in them so far, that all the
malice and cruelty of our enemies, could never draw one word from me unsutable to the
honour I thought I merited, and did in some sort enjoy, for being instrumental to defend
(as long as it was possible) our Altars and our Hearths. But all that I have undergone,
hath been abundantly recompenced to me by the favour and courtesie of the most excellent
Signior Cosimo, who hath been pleased to offer me all the preferments the greatest ambi|tion
could aspire to, which I did not refuse out of any scruple to serve so incomparable a
Prince, whose early years manifest so much Courage, Humanity, and Prudence, and so Fa|therly
a care of the publick good, but because I was very desirous not to accept of a charge
which I was not able to perform, my years and infirmities having now brought me to a
condition in which I am fitter to live in a Cloyster than a Palace, and made me good for
nothing but to talk of past times, the common vice of old Age: So that I did not think
it just or grateful to reward this excellent person so ill for his kindness, as to give him a
useless Servant, and to fill up the place of a far better. This is all I think fit to say of this
matter, I chuse to address it to you Zenobio, for the constant friendship I have ever enter|tained
with you, and formerly with your deceased Father, the companion of my Studies,
and ornament of our City. And so I bid you farewel.

THE
EPISTLE
TO
CLEMENT, VII
BEing commanded by your Holiness (whilst
in a private condition) to writ the Histo|ry
of Florence, I addressed my self to it with
all the art and diligence wherewith nature and
experience had enduced me. Having deduc'd it
to the times, in which, upon the death of Mag|nifico
Lorenzo de Medici, the whole form and mo|del
of Italy was altered; and being to describe
the height and importance of what followed in
a loftier and more vigorous stile, I judged it
best to reduce what I had written till those times
into one Volume, and present it to your Holi|ness,
that you might at least have a taste of the
fruit you had sown your self, and of my labour
and cultivation. In the perusal of this work
your Holiness will see first, to what ruine and
convulsions our Country was exposed for ma|ny
ages by the variations of Governments, af|ter
the declension of the Roman Empire in the

West. You will see how your Predecessors, the
Venetians, the Kingdom of Naples, and the Duke|dom
of Milan took their turns of Empire and
Soveraignty in this Province. You will see
your own Country refusing obedience to the
Emperors, by reason of the divisions, and those
divisions continuing till under the protection
of your Family, it began to settle into a Govern|ment.
And because it was your Holiness parti|cular
command, that in my character of your
Ancestors, I should avoid all kind of flattery,
truepraise not being morepleasing to you, than
counterfeit is ungrateful; fearing in my de|scription
of the bounty of Giovanni, the wisdom
of Cosimo, the courtesie of Piero, the magnificence
and solidity of Lorenzo, I may seem to have trans|gressed
your holiness direction, I do most hum|bly
excuse my self, both in that, and whatever
else in my descriptions may appear unfaithful
to your holiness dissatisfaction; for finding the
memoirs and relations of those who in sundry
Ages made any mention of them, full of their
commendations, I must either present them as
I found them, or pass them by as if I envied
them. And if (as some write) under their great
and egregious exploits there was always some
latent and ambitious design, contrary to the in|terest
and liberty of the publick. I know no|thing
of it, and am not bound to relate it: for in
all my narrations I never desired to cloak or pal|liate
a dishonourable action, with an honoura|ble
pretence; nor to traduce a good action, tho
to a contrary end. But how far I am from flatte|ry,

is to be seen in the whole course of my Hi|story,
especially in my speeches, and private dis|courses,
which do plainly, and without reserva|tion,
describe with the sentences, and order of
their language, the dignity and humour of the
persons. I avoid likewise in all places such words
as are impertinent to the verity, or reputation
of history, so that no man who considers my
writings impartially, can charge me with adu|lation;
especially if he observes how little or no|thing
I have said of your holiness own Father,
whose life was too short to discover him to the
world,  I too downright to expatiate upon it.
Nevertheless had he done nothing more but
given your holiness to the world, that very
thing outweighs all the actions of his Ancestors
 shall leave more ages of honour to his family,
than his malevolent fortune took years from his
life. I have endeavored, (Most Holy Sir) as far as
might be done without blemish to the truth,
to please all people, and it may so fall out I have
pleased no body. If it should, I should not wond|der,
seeing in my judgment it is impossible to
write any thing of our own times, without of|fence
to several. Yet I come forth cheerfully in|to
to the field, hoping that as I am honoured and
employed by your holiness goodness I shall be
defended by your holiness judgment; and then
with the same confidence  courage as I have
writ now; I shall pursue my engagements if my
life lasts,  your holiness continues amongst us.



The Author's
INTRODUCTION.
WHen I first took upon me to write the History of Florence,
and its transactions both at home and abroad, I thought to
have begun at the year 1434, at which time the Family of
the Medici (exalted by the merits of Cosimo,  his father Giovan|ni)
was in greater authority that any other in that City; believing
that Messer Leonardo d' Arezzo, and Messer Poggio, two excellent
Historians, had given particular description of all the passages be|fore.
But upon diligent perusal of their writings to inform my self of
their orders and methods, that thereby my own might have better ap|probation,
I found that in their narratives of the Florentine Wars,
and foreign negotiations, they had been accurate enough; but in their
civil dissentions, their intrinsick animosities, and in the effects which
followed them, they were either totally silent, or where any thing was
mentioned, it was with such brevity and abruptness as could yield nei|ther
profit nor recreation to the reader. Which I conceive they did,
either out of an opinion, that they were inconsiderable, and unwor|thy
to be transmitted to Posterity; or else they apprehended a necessity
of reflecting upon some great persons, whose family would be disoblig|ed
thereby; both which arguments (if I may speak it without offence)
are beneath the grandeur and magnanimity of a great person. For if
any thing in History be delightfull or profitable, it is those particular
descriptions; if any thing be usefull to such Citizens as have the Go|vernment
in their hands, it is such as represents the feuds and dissen|tions
in the Cities, that thereby they mbe enabled to maintain their
own unity at other peoples expence; if the example of any Common|wealth
moves a man, certainly that which is written of ones own
makes a much stronger impression; and if the factions of any State
were ever considerable, the factions in Florence were not to be preter|mitted;
the greatest part of other States have not had above one, which
sometimes has advanced, aud sometimes ruined the Government;
but Florence has had many divisions. Everybody knows how in Rome
after the expulsion of their King, there arose division betwixt the
Nobles and the people, which continued till one of them was oppres|sed.
So it was in Athens, and all the Commonwealths which
flourished in those times; but in Florence the first dissention was be|twixt
the Nobles; the next betwixt the Nobles and Citizens; and then

betwixt the Citizens and the Plebs: in all which, one was no sooner
superior, but it divided again; and the effects of those divisions were
Murders, and Banishments, and dispersion of families, such as never
occurr'd in any City, that can be remembred. And truly in my judg|ment,
nothing demonstrates the power of our City so much as the con|sequences
of those divisions, which were enough to have subverted and
destroyed any other in the world. But ours grew still greater there|by;
so remarkable was the courage of the Citizens, and so efficacious
their industry for the advancement of their Country, that those few
which surviv'd the miseries of their Predecessors, did more by their
constancy  courage towards the advancement of their interest, than
the malignity of those accidents could do to depress it. And doubt|less
had Florence been so happy after it had freed it self from the
Empire, to have assum'd such a form of Government as would have
preserv'd it in unity, I know not any commonwealth, either ancient or
modern, that would have exceeded it, or have been comparable to it,
either in riches or power. For it is observable, after the Ghibilins
were driven out of the Town in such numbers as all Tuscany and
Lombardy were full of those exiles; the Guelfs, and such as were left
behind in the expedition against Arezzo (which was the year before
the battle of Campaldino) were able to drawout of their own Citizens
1200 Horse, and 12000 Foot, And afterwards in the war against
Philippo Visconti Duke of Milan being to try their fortune rather
withtheir riches than their arms (which at that time were very much
weakened) in five years space (which was the length of that war) the
Florentines expended five millions, and 500000 Florens; and when
that War was composed, to ostentate and publish the power of that
Commonwealth, they marched out with an army, and besieged Lucca
I do not see therefore, for what reason these divisions should not be
worthy of relation; and if those Noble Authors were restrained by
fear of offending the memory of such as they were to speak of, they
were mightily out, and seem not to have understood the ambition of
mankind, and their desire to have the names of themselves and an|cestors
transmitted to Posterity; nor did they remember that many
people, not having opportunity to make themselves eminent by good
and laudable acts, have endeavoured to compass it by any way, how
scandalous and ignominious soever. Neither did they consider that
the actions which carry greatness along with them, as those of Go|vernments
and States, what ends soever they, have and which way soever
they are described, do still leave more honour than infamy to
their Family; the consideration of which things prevailed with me to
alter my design, and to begin my History from the very foundation of
the City: and because it is not my intention to transcribe what has

been done before by other people, I shall relate such things only as
occurr'd within the City to the year 144, mentioning the acci|dents
abroad only so far as will be necessary for the intelligence of
the other; after which year I shall give a particular description
both of the one and the other. Besides, for the better and more last|ing
understanding of this History, before I treat of Florence, I
shall discourse of the means by which Italy fell under the domini|on
of those Potentates which govern'd it at that time; all which
shall be comprehended in my four first Books: the first shall give a
short recital of all transactions in Italy, from the dissolution of
the Roman Empire to the year 1434. The second shall give an ac|count
of all affairs from the foundation of the City of Florence,
to the end of the War against the Pope, which commenc'd upon
the expulsion of the Duke of Athens: the third shall conclude
with the death of Ladislaus King of Naples: and in the fourth we
shall end with the year 1434, from whence afterwards to our pre|sent
times we shall give a particular Narrative of all proceedings
both within the City and without.

Captains, when they committed an error of

not to defer his beneficence till the necessity
of the object requires it 301

either within a State, or against it; it is
better to temporize and comply, than to en|deavour
to remove it by violence 302
Chap. 34. The Dictatorship was useful, not
hurtful to the Commonwealth of Rome;
and how that Power which is usurp'd, and
illegally assumed, is pernitious to a State,
not that which is conferred legally by the
suffrage of the people 303
Chap. 35. How it came to pass that the crea|tion

The First Book
OF THE
HISTORY
OF
FLORENCE.
By NICHOLAS MACHIAVEL.

To His Holiness CLEMENT the VII.
_THE people which live North-ward beyond the Rhine and the Danube,
being born in a healthful and prolifick Clime,The Northern Nations healthful and prolifick. do many times increase
to such insustainable numbers, that part of them are constrained to
abandon their Native, in quest of new Countries to inhabit. When
any of those Provinces are overcharged, and disposed to disgorge;
the Order they observe is, to divide into three parts, so equally that
each of the three consists of a just proportion of Noble and Ignoble,Their method of evacuation up|on their exces|sive increase.
Rich and Poor. After which they cast Lots, and that part to whose
fortune it falls, marches off to new Quarters where they can be found,
while the other two disburden'd of their supernumeraries remain behind, and injoy their
own Patrimonies in peace.Their excessive increase, the ruine of the Roman Empire These inundations and redundancies of people were the de|struction
of the Roman Empire, to which the Emperours themselves gave great opportu|nity;
for having forsaken Rome, the ancient Seat of the Empire, and remov'd their Re|sidence
to Constantinople, they left the Western Empire more weak, as being more re|mote
from their inspection, and by consequence more obnoxious both to their Governours
and Enemies. And indeed, for the destruction of an Empire founded upon the bloud of
so many brave men, there could not be less carelesness in the Princes, less treachery in the
Ministers, nor less force and impetuosity in those who invaded: for one inundation being
unable, several conspir'd and at last effected its ruine.
The first from those Northern Countries who invaded that Empire,The Western Goths, the first invaders of that Empire. (after the Cimbri
which were vanquish'd by Marius a Citizen of Rome) were the Visi Goti or Western Goths,
who after some Skirmishes and Conflicts upon the Consines of the Empire, were by concession
of the Emperours assigned, and for a long time permitted quietly to possess a part of the
Countrey along the Danube. And although upon several occasions, and at sundry times
they invaded the Roman Provinces; yet by the vigilance and power of the Emperours they
were always repell'd. The last that overcame them so gloriously, was Theodosius, who
having subdu'd them to his obedience, they did not (as formerly) create themselves a King,
but contented themselves with his Government and Pay, they submitted to both, and serv'd
him faithfully in his Wars. But Theodosius being dead, and his two Sons Arcadius and

Honorius succeeding; not inheriting his Virtue and Fortune as well as his Crown, the Em|pire
began to decline, and the times (as their Emperour) to grow worse and worse.
To the three parts of the Empire, Theodosius in his life-time had preferred three Go|vernours;
Ruffinus to the East, Stilico to the West, and Gildo to the South; who all of
them after the death of Theodosius despising the Title of Governours, resolv'd to make them|selves
Kings. Gildo and Ruffinus miscarried in their first Enterprise and were ruin'd: But
Stilico being better at Hypocrisie than his Brethren, endeavoured to insinuate and work him|self
into a confidence with the Emperours, yet with design so to perplex and disturb their
Affairs, that he himself might afterwards with more ease leap up into the Saddle. To incense
the Visigots, and provoke them to mutiny, he counsel'd the Emperours to abate and retrench
their former allowance; and least they should not be sufficient for the molestation of the
Empire, he contrived that the Burgundi, Franchi, Vandali and Alani, (Northern people
like the other, and in motion for new Quarters) should fall likewise upon the Roman
Provinces.
The Visigoti as soon as they found themselves retrench'd, that they might be in better
order to revenge it, created Alaricus their King, under whose conduct they assayl'd the
Empire;Rome sack'd by them, under the command of Alaricus. and after several Rencounters and accidents, they over-ran all Italy, and sack'd
Rome. Not long after, Alaricus died, and was succeeded by Ataulfus, who marrying
Placidia the Emperours Sister, Articled upon the Match, to assist in the Relief of France
and Spain, which Provinces were at that time much infested by the Vandali, Burgundi,
Alani, and Franchi upon the aforesaid occasion. Ataulfus undertook only the Vandali,
who having possest themselves of that part of Spain call'd Betica, being press'd hard by the
Visigoti, and distressed beyond all remedy, they were call'd over by Boniface (who at that
time Govern'd Africk for the Emperours) to come and plant there,Boniface Go|vernour of Africk for the Emperour. for those Provinces
being then in rebellion, he was afraid his ill Administration might be discovered. This
invitation and their own Exigence concurring, the Vandals embrac'd that Enterprize,
and performed many memorable and brave things in Africk, under Gensericus their
King.
In the mean time Theodosius the Son of Arcadius succeeded to the Empire, who regard|ing
but litle the Affairs of the West, gave those Nations the first thoughts of fixing in their
New Conquests. Accordingly the Vandali in Africk, the Alani and Visigoti in Spain,
began to set up for themselves,Gallia overrun by the Franks, and from them call'd France. and Lord it over the Natives. The Franchi, and the Bur|gundi,
not only over-run and possess'd themselves of France, but according to the parts they
possest, they gave it their Names; one of them being call'd Francia, and the other Burgundia.
The success of their Camrades inviting new multitudes to the subversion of the Empire, the
Hunni fell upon Pannonia (which is a Province upon the banks of the Danube) and giving it
their Name,The Hunni Conquer and Denominate Hungaria. have denominated it Hungaria to this very day. Then as an addition to the
disorders, the Emperour finding himself attacked in so many places, to contract the num|ber
of his Enemies; he began first to treat and capitulate with the Vandals, then with the
Franks, which Treaty increas'd the Authority of the Barbarians, and diminish'd his own.
Nor was the Island of great Britain (call'd England at this day) exempt from its troubles:
For the Britains grown apprehensive of the people which had Conquered France, and not
discerning which way the Emperour would be able to defend them, call'd in the Angli
(a Nation in Germany) to their assistance.Britain call'd Anglia from the Angli. The Angli, under the Conduct of Vortiger their
King, undertook their defence, and at first behav'd themselves faithfully; afterwards their
Opportunity increasing with their Power, they drove the Natives out of the Island, possess'd
themselves of it, and gave it their Name in commutation for its liberty. Being robb'd of
their Countrey, and made Valiant by Necessity, though they were not able to recover their
own, the Britains began to think of invading some other, and planting themselves there.
In this Resolution they cross'd the Seas with their whole Families, and possess'd themselves
of those parts which lie upon the Coasts of France, and are call'd Britain to this day. The
Hunns (who as was said before) had over-run Pannonia, being streightned and disturb'd
in their Quarters by other Nations, viz. the Zepidi, Eruli, Turingi and Ostrogoti (or Eastern
Goths) they rose again, and put themselves once more in motion for New Habitations.
Not being able to force their way into France, which was at that time defended by the Bar|barians,The Hunni in|vade Italy un|der Attila.
they fell into Italy under Attila their King, who not long before (to rid himself
of a Partner in the Government) had slain Bleda his own Brother, and by that means
made himself absolute. Andaricus King of the Zepidi, and Velamir King of the Ostrogoti
remained as his Subjects. Attila having in this manner made his inroad into Italy, he be|sieg'd
Aquilegia,Attila besieges and takes Aquilegia. lay (without interruption) two years before it, wasted the Countrey
round about it, and dispersed the Inhabitants, which (as we shall afterwards declare) was
the occasion of building the City of Venice. After he had taken, sack'd and demolish'd

Aquilegia,He advances to Rome, bt retires at the request of the Pope. and several other Towns, he advanc'd towards Rome, but forbore the destru|ction
of it upon the intercession of the Pope, for whom Attila had so great a Reverence and
Veneration, that upon his single persuasion, he withdrew out of Italy into Austria, where
he died. After Attila's death, Velamir King of the Ostrogoti, with the Commanders of
other Nations,The Hunni driven bac o|ver the Danu|be, return home. took up Arms against Tenricus and Eurius, Attila's Sons. One of them
they kill'd, and forc'd the other with the Hunni back again over the Danube into their
own Countrey: Upon which the Ostrogoti and Zepidi plac'd themselves in Pannonia, and
the Eruli and Turingi remain'd upon the Bank of the Danube.
Attila being departed out of Italy, Valentinianus at that time Emperour of the West,
had a design to repair that Empire;The first Re|sidence of the Roman Em|perours at Ravenna. and for his Capacity of defending it with more Ease
and Convenience against the irruptions of the Barbarians, he quitted Rome, and setled his
Residence at Ravenna. The Calamities wherewith the Western Empire had been oppres|sed,
were the occasion that the Emperour residing at Constantinople, had many times transfer'd
the possession of it to other people as a thing of great danger and expence, many times
without the Emperour's permission;New Empe|rours elected by the Romans, upon the non|residence of their old. the Romans seeing themselves deserted, had created
new Emperours in order to their defence; and sometimes other persons taking advantage
of their own Interest and Authority, Usurp'd, as it happen'd when Maximus a Citizen of
Rome, got possession of it after the death of Valentinianus, and forc'd his Widow Eudoxa
to take him for her Husband, who desirous of revenge, and disdaining (being of Imperial
extraction) the Embraces of so inferiour a person, she invited privately Gensericus King of
the Vandals into Italy, remonstrating the Easiness and Utility of the Conquest; who al|lured
by the Prize, was without much difficulty perswaded. He entred Italy with his Ar|my,
march'd up to Rome, found it abandon'd, sack'd it, and continued in it fourteen days;
after which he took and plundr'd several other Towns, and having laden both himself
and his Army with the Spoyl, he return'd into Africk. The Romans returning (upon his
departure) Maximus being dead, they made Avicus (a Roman) Emperour. After many
occurrences both within Italy and without, and the death of several Emperours, the Empire
of Constantinople fell into the hands of Zeno, and the Empire of Rom (by Stratagem and Ar|tifice)
to Orestes, and Augustulus his Son, who, preparing to defend it by force, were in|vaded
by the Eruli and Turingi (plac'd as we said before upon the Banks of the Danube)
Confederate for that Expedition under the Command of Odoacres their General.The Lom|bards invade Italy. Of such
places as they had thought good to baulk and leave empty, the Lombards possessed them|selves,
a Northen Nation like the rest, and Commanded by Godoglio their King, which
were the last People that plagued Italy, as shall be shown in its place. Odoacres having made
his way into Italy, he encountred, vanquish'd, and slew Orestes near Pavia, but Augustulus
got offOdoacres call'd King of Rome, and the first of the Bar|barians which thought of fix|ing in Italy. After this Victory, that the Title might change with the Government, Odoacres
caus'd himself to be call'd King of Rome, and was the first Chieftain of those Nations (which
at that time over-ran the whole World) that thought of fixing in Italy; for (either suspect|ing
their abilities to keep it, by reason of the easiness and facility wherewith it might be re|liev'd
by the Emperour of the East, or for some other secret cause) the rest had ravag'd and
plunder'd it, but they always retir'd, and sought out other Countreys for their Establish|ment
and Plantation.
In those days,The Old Empire divid|ed into Can|tons. the ancient Empire of Rome was reduc'd under these Princes. Zeno
Governing in Constantinople, Commanded the whole Empire of the East. The Ostrogoti
Commanded Mesia: The Visigoti, Pannonia: The Suevi and Alani, Gascoigne and Spain:
The Vandali Africa: The Franchi and Burgundi, France: The Eruli and Turingi, Italy.
The Kingdom of the Ostrogoti was devolv'd upon a Nephew of Velamir's call'd Theodorick,
who retaining an Amity with Zeno Emperour of the East, writ him word, That his
Ostrogoti being in Valour superiour to other Nations, they thought it injust and un|reasonable
to be inferiour in Territory and Command, and that it would be impossible for
him to confine them within the Limits of Pannonia. That being therefore necessitated to
comply, and suffer them to take up Arms in quest of New Countreys, he could do no less
than give him timely advertisment, that he might provide against the worst, and if he
pleas'd assign them some other Countrey, which by his Grace and Favour they might in|habit
with more Latitude and Convenience. Whereupon Zeno partly out of fear, and partly
desirous to drive Odoacres out of Italy,Theodorick invades Italy, slays Odoacres, calls himself King of Rome, and held his re|sidence at Ra|venna. directed Theodorick against him, and gave him that
Countrey for his pains, when it was his fortune to catch it. Theodorick accepts the Proposi|tion,
removes from Pannonia (where he left the Zepidi his Friends) and marching into
Italy, slew Odoacres and his Sn, call'd himself King of Rome by his Example, and made
Ravenna his Residence, upon the same Reasons as had prevail'd before with Valentinian:
Theodorick was an excellent person both in War and Peace. In the first he was always
Victor, in the last a continual Benefactor, as that City and that Nation experimented often.

He divided his Ostrogoti into several Countreys, appointing Governours over them, that
might Command in time of Wars, and Correct in time of Peace. He inlarged Ravenna,
and repair'd Rome, and restor'd all its Priviledges, except its Military Discipline. With|out
any noise or tumult of War, by his own single Wisdom and Authority, he kept all
the Barbarian Princes (who had Cantonized the Empire) in their just bounds. He built
several Towns and Castles between the Adriatick-Sea and the Alps, to obstruct any new
Incursion by the Barbarians; and had not his many Virtues been sulli'd and eclipsed to|wards
his latter end by some Cruelties he committed upon a jealousie of being depos'd (as
the deaths of Symmachus and Boetius, both of them virtuous men, do sufficiently declare) his
Memory would have been this day as honourable, as his Person was then: for by his
Vertue and Bounty, not only Rome and Italy, but all the rest of the Western Empire was
freed from the continual Conflicts, which for so many years it indur'd by the frequent ir|ruption
of the Barbarians, and reduc'd into good Order and Condition: And certainly if
any times were ever miserable in Italy, and those Provinces which were over-run by the
Barbarians, they were the times betwixt the Reigns of Acadius and Honorius, and his;
for if it be consider'd what inconveniences, and damage do generally result to a Common-wealth
or Kingdom upon alteration of Prince or Government, especially if effected not by
forreign force, but civil dissention: If it be observed, how fatal the least Changes prove to
Common-wealth or Kingdom how potent soever, it may easily be imagin'd how much Italy
and other Provinces of the Roman Empire suffer'd in those days, losing not only their
Government, but their Laws, Customs, Conversations, Religions, Language, Habits, and
even their Names! The thoughts of any one of which things (without so great an accumu|lation)
would make the stoutest heart to ake, much more the seeing and feeling of them.
And as this was the destruction, so it was the foundation and augmentation of many Cities.
In the number of those which were ruin'd was Aquileia, Luni, Chiusi, Popolonia, Fiesole,
and many others. Among those which were new built, were Venice, Siena, Ferrara,
l' Aquila, and several other both Towns and Castles, which for brevity sake I omit. Those
which from small beginnings became great and considerable, were Florence, Genoa, Pisa,
Milan, Naples, and Bolonia, to which may be added the ruine and reparation of Rome, and
several other Cities which were demolish'd and rebuilt. Among these devastations, and
inroads of new people, there sprang forth new Languages, as is visible by what is us'd
both in France, Spain, and Italy, which being mixt with the Language of their Invaders
and the ancient Roman, is become new, and clear another thing to what it was before.
Besides not only the Provinces lost their Names, but particular places, Rivers, Seas, and
Men; France, Italy, and Spain, being full of new Appellatives, quite contrary to what they
were of old; as the Po, Garda, and Archipelago, for Rivers and Seas; and for Men, in stead
of Cesar and Pompey, they began to be call'd Peter, Iohn, Matthew, c. But among
all these Variations, the changing of their Religions was of no less imporance: for the
Custome and Prescription of the ancient Faith being in combat and competition with the
Miracles of the New, many tumults and dissentions were created, which had the Chri|stian
Church been unanimous and entire, would never have happen'd: but the Greek,
the Roman, the Church at Ravenna being in contention, and the Heretick, with the Ca|tholick
as furiously zealous, they brought great misery upon the World, as Africa can
witness, which suffer'd more by their Arrianism (which was the Doctrine of the Vandals)
than by all their avarice and cruelty. Whilst men lived expos'd to so many persecutions,
the terrour and sadness of their hearts was legible in their faces; for besides the multitude
of Calamities they endured otherwise, great part of them had not power to betake them|selves
to the protection of God Almighty (who is the surest refuge of all that are in distress)
for being uncertain whither their devotions were to be directed, they died miserably with|out
any.
Theodorick therefore deserved no small praise, who was the first which gave them respite
from the multitude of their Evils, and restored Italy to such a degree of Grandeur in the
thirty eight years which he raigned there, that there was scarce any thing to be seen of
its former desolation:Theodorick dics. but when he died, and the Government devolv'd upon Atalaricus
the Son of Amalasciunta his Sister, in a short time (the malice of their Fortune being not
exhausted as yet) they relaps'd, and fell over head and ears into their old troubles again:
For Atalaricus dying not long after him, the Kingdom fell into the hands of his Mother,
who was betray'd by Theodate, (a person she had call'd in to assist her in the Government.)
She being remov'd, and he made King, to the great dissatisfaction of the Ostrogoths, to
whom that Usurpation had made him insufferably odious; Iustinian the Emperour took
courage, began to think of driving him out of Italy, and deputed Bellisarius his General
for that Expedition, who before had Conquer'd Africa, driven out the Vandals, and

reduc'd it under that Empire again. Having first possessed himself of Sicily, and from
thence passed his Army into Italy, Bellisarius recovered Naples and Rome. The Goths
foreseeing their destruction;Bellisarius General for Iu|stinian the Em|perour. kill'd Theodate their King as the occasion of all, and elected
Vitegetes in his place, who after several Skirmishes was at length besieged and taken in
Ravenna by Bellisarius, who (not prosecuting his Victory as was expected) was call'd back
by Iustinian, and his Command given to Iohannes and Vitalis, who were much short of
him both in Virtue and Conversation; so that the Goths took heart, and created Ildovado
their King, who was at that time Governour of Verona: and being kill'd shortly after, the
Kingship fell to Totila; who beat the Emperours forces, recover'd Tuscany, and subdu'd
the Governours of all those Provinces which Bellisarius had reduc'd. Upon which mis|fortune
Iustinianus thought it necessary to send him again into Italy; but returning with
small Force, he rather lost what he had gained before, than acquir'd any new Reputation.
For Totila (whilst Bellisarius lay incamped with his Army at Hostia) besieg'd Rome,Totila takes, sacks, and burns Rome. and
took it as it were under his Nose; and then upon consideration that he could neither
well keep nor relinquish it, he demolish'd the greatest part of it, forcing away the people,
and carrying the Senators as Prisoners along with him, and taking no notice of Bellisarius,
he advanc'd with his Army into Calabria to encounter and cut off certain supplies which
were sent out of Greece to reinforce him. Bellisarius seeing Rome abandon'd in this
manner, addressed himself to a very honourable Enterprise, and entring the City, re|pair'd
the Walls withall possible Celerity, and re-invited the Inhabitants when he had
done. But Fortune concurr'd not to the nobleness of his design: for Iustinianus being at
that time invaded by the Parthi, Bellisarius was call'd back to repell the Invasion. In obe|dience
to his Master, he marched his Army out of Italy, and left that Province to the
discretion of the Enemy, who seized again upon Rome, but us'd it not so barbarously as
before, being wrought upon by the prayers of Saint Benedict (a person very eminent in those
times for his Sanctity) he apply'd himself rather to repair than destroy it. In the mean
time Iustinian had made a Peace with the Parthi, and resolving to send new Supplies into
Italy, he was diverted by a new Alarm from the Sclavi (another Northern people) who
had pass'd the Danube, and fallen upon Illyria and Thrace: So that Totila had his full
swing, and was in a manner in possession of all Italy. As soon as Iustinian had Conquer'd
the Sclavi, and setled the Countreys which they had invaded, he sent a new Army into
Italy under the Conduct of Narsetes an Eunuch,Narsetes a new General for Iustinian. a brave Captain, and of great experience
in the Wars. Being arrived in Italy, he fought, beat, and kill'd Totila, after whose death
the remainder of the Goths retir'd into Pavia, and made Teia their King. On the other
side, Narsetes after his Victory took Rome, and than marching against Teia he ingaged
him about Nocera, defeated his Army, and slew him among the rest: By which disaster
the very Name of the Goths was well near extinguish'd in Italy, where they had reigned
from the time of Theodorick, to this Teia, full seventy years. But Italy was scarce warm
in its Liberty, when Iustinianus dy'd, and left his Son Iustinus to succeed, who by the
Counsel of his Wife Sophia, recall'd Narsetes out of Italy, and sent Longinus in his place.
Longinus, according to the Example of his Predecessors, kept his Residence at Ravenna, in
other things he digress'd,Longinus al|ters the Go|vernment in Italy. and particularly by introducing a new form of Government in
Italy, not constituting Governours in every Province as, the Goths had done before, but
deputing a Captain in every City or other Town of importance, with the Title of Duke.
Nor in this distribution did he show any greater favour to Rome, than to the rest; for re|moving
the Consuls and Senate (Names which to that time had been sacred among them)
he constituted a Duke which he sent every year from Ravenna, and his Government was
call'd the Dukedom of Rome. But lie that more immediately represented the Emperour at
Ravenna, and had the Universal Government of Italy, was call'd Esarco. This division
not only facilitated the ruine of Italy, but hasten'd it exceedingly by giving the Lombards
opportunity to possess it. Narsetes was much disgusted with the Emperour for calling him
off from the Command of those Provinces which by his own Vertue, and effusion of his
bloud he had acquir'd: And Sophia not thinking it injury sufficient to get him recall'd, had
given out contumelious words, as if she would make him Spin among the rest of the
Eunuchs. Whereupon in great disdain Narsetes incourag'd Alboino King of the Lombards,
(who at that time Govern'd in Pannonia) to invade Italy and possess it.
As was shown before, the Lombards were enter'd and had taken possession of such places
upon the Danube as had been deserted by the Eruli and Turingi, when Odoacres their King
conducted them into Italy. They had continued there some time, till their Kingdom fell to
Alboino, for a daring and couragious man, under whom passing the Danube, they encoun|ter'd
with Commodus King of the Zepidi (a People planted in Pannonia) and overcame him.
Among the rest Rosmunda one of Commodus Daughters was taken Prisoner, whom Alboinus

took for his Wife, made himself Lord of her Countrey, and mov'd by the barbarousness
of his nature, he caus'd a Cup to be made of her Father's Skull, and in memory of that
Victory, drank out of it very often. But being call'd into Italy by Narsetes, with whom he
had retain'd a Friendship in his Wars with the Goths; he left Pannonia to the Hunni (who
as we said before, return'd into their own Countrey after the death of Attila) march'd
into Italy, and finding it so strangly Cantoniz'd and divided, he possessed (or rather
surpriz'd) Pavia, Milan, Verona, Vicenza, all Tuscany, and the great part of Flaminia
(call'd now Romagnia); So that presuming from the greatness and suddenness of his Con|quests,
all Italy was his own, he made a solemn Feast at Verona, where much drinking
having exalted his Spirits, and Commodus his Skull being full of Wine, he caus'd it to be
presented to Rosmunda the Queen, who sat over against him at the Table, declaring (and
that so loud she could not but hear) that at a time of such hearty and extraordinary Mirth,
it was fit she should drink one Cup with her Father. Which expression touching the Lady
to the quick, she resolv'd to be reveng'd; and knowing that Almachilde, a young and valiant
Lombard, had an intrigue with one of her Maids, she prevail'd that she might personate her
one night, and lie with him her self. Accordingly Almachilde being introduc'd upon a time
into a very dark place, he injoy'd Rosmunda instead of her Maid. The Business being
done, Rosmunda discover'd her self, told him what was pass'd; That now it was at his
Choice, whether he would kill Alboino,Alboino kill'd by the Conspiracy of his Wife. and injoy her and her Kingdom, or be kill'd him|self
for vitiating his Wife. Almachilde had no fancy to be slain, and therefore chose the
other Proposition of killing his Master; but when they had kill'd him, they found them|selves
so far from acquiring the Kingdom, that they were afraid of being made away by
the Lombards, out of the affection they bare to the Memory of Alboino; for which cause
packing up with all the Jewels and Treasure they could make, they marched off to Longinus
at Revenna, who receiv'd them honourably.
During these Troubles, Iustinus the Emperour died, and Tiberius was elected in his
Place; but being imploy'd in his Wars against the Parthians, he was not at leasure to send
Relief into Italy. Which Longinus looking upon as an opportunity to make himself King of
the Lombards, and of all Italy besides, by the help of Rosmunda and her Treasure; he imparted
his Design to her, and perswaded her to kill Almachilde, and take him afterwards for her
Husband. She accepted the Motion, and having in order thereunto prepar'd a Cup of
Poison, she gave it with her own hand to Almachilde as he came thirsty out of a Bath,
who having drank off half, finding it work, and great Convulsions within him, concluding
what it was, he forc'd her to drink the rest, so that in a few hours both of them died, and
Longinus lost all hopes of making himself King. In the mean time at a Convention of the
Lombards at Pavia (which they had made their Metropolis) they created Clefi their
King, who re-edified Imola, that had been destroyed by Narsetes. He conquer'd Rimini,
and in a manner all up as far as Rome, but died in the middle of his Cariere. This Clefi be|hav'd
himself so cruelly, not only to Strangers, but even to the Lombards themselves, that
the Edge of their Monarchical inclination being taken off, they would have no more
Kings, but constituted Thirty, they call'd Dukes, to Govern under them. Which Counsel
was the cause the Lombards extended not their Conquests over all Italy, nor dilated their
Dominion beyond Benevento, Rome, Ravenna, Cremona, Mantua, Padua, Monfelice, Parma,
Bolonia, Faenza, Furli, Cesana; some of them defended themselves for some time, other
never fell at all under their subjection. For having no King, they were first render'd un|apt
for the Wars; and when afterwards they reassum'd their Old Government, and created
Kings again, the small relish and taste the people had had of Liberty, render'd them less
obedient to their Prince, and more contentious among themselves, and not only put a
stop to the Cariere of their Victories at first, but was the occasion afterwards, that they were
driven out of Italy. Things being in this posture with the Lombards; The Romans, and
Longinus came to terms with them, and it was agreed, that Arms should be laid down on
all hands, and each enjoy what was in their proper possession.
About this time the Bishops of Rome began to take upon them, and to exercise greater
Authority than they had formerly done.The Autho|rity of the Bi|shops of Rome began to in|crease. At first the Successors of Saint Peter were vene|rable
and eminent for their Miracles, and the holiness of their Lives; and their Examples
added daily such numbers to the Christian Church, that to obviate or remove the Con|fusions
which were then in the World, many Princes turned Christians, and the Emperour
of Rome being converted among the rest, and quitting Rome, to hold his Residence at Con|stantinople;
the Roman Empire (as we have said before) began to decline, but the Church
of Rome augmented as fast. Nevertheless, untill the coming in of the Lombards, all Italy
being under the dominion either of Emperours or Kings, the Bishops assumed no more
power than what was due to their Doctrine, and Manners; in Civil Affairs, they were

subject to the Civil Power,Bishops of Rome imploy'd as Ministers by the Emperours and Kings, and sometimes executed by them. imploy'd many times by the Emperours and Kings, as their
Ministers; and many times executed for their ill Administration. But Theodorick King of
the Gothi, fixing his Seat at Ravenna, was that which advanc'd their interest, and made
them more considerable in Italy; for there being no other Prince left in Rome, the Romans
were forc'd for Protection to pay greater Allegiance to the Pope. And yet their Authority
advanc'd no farther at that time, than to obtain the Preference before the Church of Ra|venna.
But the Lombards having invaded, and reduc'd Italy into several Cantons; the
Pope took the opportunity, and began to hold up his head: For being as it were Governour
and Principal at Rome, the Emperour of Constantinople and the Lombards bare him a re|spect,
so that the Romans (by mediation of their Pope) began to treat and confederate with
Longinus and the Lombards, not as Subjects, but as Equals and Companions; which said
Custom continuing, and the Popes entring into Allyance sometimes with the Lombards,
and sometimes with the Greeks, contracted great reputation to their dignity: But the de|struction
of the Eastern Empire following so close under the Reign of the Emperour
Heracleus,The Eastern Empire de|stroy'd in the time of Hera|cleus the Em|perour. in whose time the Schiavi (a people we mention'd before) fell again upon Illyria
and over-ran it, and call'd it Sclavonia, from their own Name. The other parts of that
Empire being infested first by the Persians, afterwards by the Saracens, out of Arabia, un|der
the Conduct of Mahomet, and last of all, by the Turks, and having lost several Pro|vinces
which were members of it, as Syria, Africa, and Egypt: The Pope lost the conve|nience
of the Emperours protection in time of Adversity, and the power of the Lombards
increasing too fast on the other side, he thought it but necessary to address himself to the
King of France for assistance; so that the Wars which hapned afterwards in Italy, were
occasioned by the Popes, and the several inundations of Barbarians, invited by them; which
manner of proceeding having continued to our times, has held, and does still hold Italy
divided and inirm. But in my description of Occurrences betwixt those times and our
own, I shall not inlarge upon the ruine of the Empire, which in truth receiv'd but little
assistance from the Popes, or any other Princes of Italy, till the dayes of Charles the 8th.
but discourse rather how the Popes with their Censures, Comminations and Arms,
mingled together with their Indulgences, became formidable and reverenced, and how ha|ving
made ill use both of the one and the other, they have lost the one entirely, and remain
at the discretion of other people for the other. But to reurn to our Order. I say that
Gregory the Third being created Pope, and Aistolfus King of the Lombards; Aistolfus con|trary
to League and Agreement, seiz'd upon Ravenna, and made War upon the Pope:
Gregory not daring (for the reasons abovesaid,) to depend upon the weakness of the Empire,
or the fidelity of the Lombards (whom he had already found false) appli'd himself to Pepin
the Second, who from Lord of Austracia and Brabantia, was become King of France, not
so much by his own Virtue, as by the Chivalry of his Unkle Pepin, and Charles Martel his
Father: For Charles Martel being Governour of that Kingdom, gave that memorable de|feat
to the Saracens near Torsi upon the River Totra, in which above 200000. of them were
slain; upon the reputation of which Victor'y under the discipline of his Father, and his
own deportment in it besides, Pepin was afterwards made King of that Kingdom; to
whom, when Pope Gregory appli'd himself for Relief against the Lombards, Pepin return'd
Answer, that he would be ready to assist him, but he desir'd first to have the honour to see
him, and pay his personal respects. Upon which Invitation Pope Gregory went into France,
passing thorow the Lombards Quarters without any interruption, so great Reverence they
bare to Religion in those days. Being arriv'd, and honourably receiv'd in France, he was
after some time dismiss'd with an Army into Italy; which having besieg'd Pavia, and re|duc'd
the Lombards to distress, Aistolfus was constrain'd to certain terms of Agreement
with the French, which were obtain'd by the intercession of the Pope, who desir'd not the
death of his Enemy, but that he might rather be converted and live. Among the rest of
the Articles of that Treaty, it was agreed, That Aistolfus should restore all the Lands he
had usurped from the Church. But when the French Army was return'd into France,
Aistolfus forgot his Ingagement, which put the Pope upon a second Application to King
Pepin, who re-suppli'd him again, sent a new Army into Italy, overcame the Lombards,
and possessed himself of Ravenna, and (contrary to the desire of the Grecian Emperour)
gave it to the Pope, with all the Lands under that Exarchat, and the Countrey of Urbino,
and la Marca into the bargain. In the interim Aistolfus died, and Desiderio a Lombard, and
Duke of Tuscany, taking up Arms to succeed him, begg'd Assistance of the Pope, with
Promise of perpetual Amity for the future; which the Pope granted, as far as the other
Princes would consent. At first Desiderio was very punctual, and observed his Articles to
a hair, delivering up the Towns as he took them to the Pope, according to his Ingage|ment
to King Pepin, nor was there any Exarchus sent afterwards from Constantinople to

Ravenna, but all was Arbitrary, and manag'd according to the pleasure of the Pope. Not
long after, Pepin died, and Charles his Son succeeded in the Government, who was call'd
the Great, from the greatness of his Exploits. About the same time Theodore the First
was advanc'd to the Papacy, and falling out with Desiderio, was besieg'd by him in Rome.
In his exigence the Pope had recourse to the King of France (as his Predecessor had done
before him) and Charles not only suppli'd him with an Army, but marching over the
Alps at the Head of it himself, he besieg'd Desiderio in Pavia, took him and his Son in it,
sent them both Prisoners into France, and went in person to Rome, to visit the Pope, where
he adjudg'd and determin'd, That his Holiness being God's Vicar, could not be subject to the
Iudgment of Man. For which the Pope and people together, declar'd him Emperour,
and Rome began again to have an Emperour of the West; and whereas formerly the Popes
were confirm'd by the Emperours,The King of France exempts the Pope from all humane Juris|diction. the Emperour now in his Election was to be behold|ing
to the Pope; by which means, the power and dignity of the Empire declin'd, and the
Church began to advance, and by these steps to usurp upon the Authority of Temporal
Princes. The Lombards had been in Italy 222 years, so long as to retain nothing of their
original Barbarity but their name. Charles being desirous to reform Italy, in the time of
Leo III. was contented they should inhabit and denominate the parts where they were
born, which since then, have been call'd Lombardy: and because the name of Rome
was venerable among them; he appointed that part of Italy which was adjacent, and un|der
the Exarchat of Ravenna, should be call'd Romagnia. Moreover, he created his Son
Pepin King of Italy, extending his Jurisdiction as far as Benevento; all the rest was continued
under the dominion of the Grecian Emperour, with whom Charles had made an Alliance.
During these Transactions,Pascal created Pope. The Original of Cardinals. Pascal the First was elected Pope, and the Parish Priests in
Rome, by reason of their propinquity and readiness at every Election, to adorn their
power with a more illustrious Title, began to be call'd Cardinals; arrogating so much to
themselves, (especially after they had excluded the Voices of the people) that seldom any
Pope was created but by them, out of their own number. Pascal being dead, he was suc|ceeded
by Eugenius the Second, of the Order of Santa Sabina. Italy being in this manner
under the Authority of the French,Eugenius the II. Pope. changed its Form and Oeconomy in some measure; for
the Pope having incroach'd upon the Temporal Authority, created Counts and Marquesses,
as Longinus Exarchat of Ravenna,Ospurcus made Pope, changes his Name. had made Dukes before. After some few, Ospurcus a
Roman succeeded to the Papacy, who not satisfied with the uncomliness of his Name,
call'd himself Sergius, and gave the first occasion for the changing their Names, which has
since been frequently practis'd at their several Elections. About this time Charles the Empe|rour
died, and his Son Lodovic succeeded, yet not so quietly, but that there arose so many and
so great differences betwixt his Sons, that in the days of his Grand-Children, the Empire
was wrested from his Family, restor'd to the Almans, and the next German Emperour
was call'd Ainolfus. Nor did Charles his Posterity by their dissentions lose only the Em|pire,
but their Soveraignty in Italy likewise; for the Lombards resuming Courage, fell
foul upon the Pope and his Romans, who not knowing to whose protection to betake
himself, was constrain'd to make Berengarius (Dukeof Friuli) King of Italy. Incouraged
by these Accidents, the Hunni (who at that time were planted in Pannonia) took heart, and
invaded Italy, but coming to a Battel with Berengarius, they were overthrown, and forc'd
back again into Pannonia, or rather into Hungaria, it being at that time call'd by their
Name. At that time Romano was Emperour of Greece, who being General of his Army had
usurp'd upon Constantine, and forc'd the Government out of his hand; and because during
these innovations, Puglia and Calabria (which as I said before, had subjected themselves
to that Empire) were then in Rebellion; inrag'd at their insolence, he permitted the Sa|racens
to possess those Countreys, if they could gain them; who invading them thereupon,
immediately subdu'd them, and attempted upon Rome. But the Romans, (Berengarius
being imploy'd against the Hunni) made Alberigo, Duke of Tuscany, their General; by
whose Valour their City was preserv'd, and the Saracens raising their Siege retir'd, built
a Castle upon the Mountain Gargano, and from thence Lorded it over Puglia and Calabria,
and infested all that part of Italy besides. Thus it was that Italy in those times was mar|velously
afflicted towards the Alps by the Hunni, towards Naples by the Saracens; and it
continued in that Agony several years, under three Berengarii successively; during which
time the Pope and the Church were under no the less perturbation; having no refuge to fly
to, by reason of the dissention among the Western Princes, and the impotence of the
Eastern.The Original of Pisa. The Govern|ment of Italy, Anno 931. The City of Genoa, and all its Territory upon the Rivers, were over-run by the
Saraens, which, by the resort of multitudes (driven thither out of their own Countrey)
was the foundation of the Grandeur of Pisa. These Accidents happen'd in the year
DCCCCXXXI. But Ottone Son of Enricus and Matilda, and Duke of Saxony, coming

to the Empire, and being a man of great reputation for his Conduct and Prudence,
Agabito the Pope addressed himself to him, imploring his Assistance in Italy against the
Tyranny of the Berengarii.Agabito Pop. The States of Italy in those days were Govern'd in this man|ner.
Lombardy was under the Jurisdiction of Berengarius the Third, and Albertus his
Son. Tuscany and Romania under the Dominion of a Governour deputed by the Emperour
of the West. Puglia and Calabria were part under the Greek Empire, and part under the
Saracens. In Rome, two Consuls were created out of the Nobility every year, according to
ancient Custome, to which a Prefect was added to administer Justice to the people. They
had moreover a Counsel of Twelve, who provided Governours annually for all Towns
under their Jurisdiction. The Pope had more or less power in Rome, and in all Italy, ac|cording
as his favour was more or less with the Emperour, or other persons which were
more potent than he. Ottone, to gratifie his request, came into Italy with an Army,
fought with the Berengarii, drove them out of their Kingdom (which they had injoy'd
55 years) and restor'd the Pope to his former dignity. Ottone had a Son, and a Grand-Child
of his own Name, both which, one after the other, succeeded in the Empire, and in
the time of Ottone the Third, Pope Gregory the Fifth was expelled by the Romans.Gregory the 5. Pope, expell'd and restor'd; devests the Ro|mans of their power of creat|ing Emperours and consers it upon six Prin|ces of Germany. Ottone
undertook a new Expedition into Italy in his behalf, and having once again re-establish'd
him in his Chair, the Pope to be reveng'd of the Romans, took from them the power of
Creating the Emperours, and conferr'd it upon six German Princes; Three Bishops,
, Treves and Colen, and Three temporal Princes, the Duke of Brandenburg, the
Prince Palatine of the Rhine, and the Duke of Saxony; and this happen'd in the year 1002.
After the death of Ottone the Third, Enrico Duke of Bavaria was created Emperour by the
said Electors, and was Crown'd twelve years after by Stephanus the Eighth. Enricus and
Simeonda his Wife, were eminent for their Piety, having as a Testimony of it, built and
endow'd several Churches, and among the rest that of S. Miniato, near the City of Florence.
In the year 1024, Enrico died, was succeeded by Corrado of Suevia, and he by Enrico II,
who coming to Rome, and finding a Schism in the Church, and three Popes in being at the
same time, he degraded them all,Clement 2d. Pope and causing Clement II. to be elected, was Crown'd
Emperour by him. Italy was then govern'd partly by the People, partly by Princes, and
partly by the Emperours Ministers, the chiefest of which (to whom the rest did in all
matters of importance refer) had the Title of Chancellor. Among the Princes, the most
powerful was Gottifredus, Husband to the Countess Matilda, who was Sister to Enricus II.
She and her Husband had the possession of Lucca, Parma, Reggio, and Mantua, with all
that Countery which is now call'd the Patrimony of the Church. The Popes at that time had
no small trouble upon their hands, by reason of the ambition of the people of Rome; who
having at first made use of the Papal Authority to free themselves of the Emperours, as
soon as the Popes had taken upon them the Regiment of the City, and reform'd things as
they thought good themselves, of a sudden they became their Enemies; and they receiv'd
more injury from the people, than from any other Christian Prince whatsoever, Rebelling
and mutining at the same time the Popes by their Censures, made the whole West to
tremble; nor was the design of either of them less than to subvert the Authority and Re|putation
of the one and the other. Nicolas II. arriving at the Popedom, as Gregory V. had
taken from the Romans the priviledge of creating the Emperour;Nicolas d Pope, excludes the Romans  reduces the Pa|pal Elections to the suffrage of Cardinals only. so he depriv'd them of
their concurrence to the Election of the Pope, restraining it wholly to the suffrage of the
Cardinals; nor contented with this, by agreement with the Princes which Govern'd at that
time in Puglia and Calabria, (for reasons which shall be mentioned hereafter) he forc'd all
the Officers sent thither by the people, to assert their Jurisdiction, to pay Allegiance to the
Pope, and some of them he displaced. After Nicholaus was dead, there happen'd a great
Schism in the Church:Schism, and Anti-Popes in the Church. The Clergy of Lombardy would not yeild obedience to Alexander II.
who was chosen at Rome, but created Cadalo of Parma, Anti-Pope. Enrico detesting the
extravagant dominion of the Popes, sent to Alexander to resign, and to the Cardinals,
that they should repair into Germany, in order to a new Election; so that he was the first
Prince which was made sensible of the effects of their Spiritual Fulminations; for the Pope
calling together a new Council at Rome, depriv'd him both of his Empire, and Kingdom.
Some of the Italians following the Pope's, and some of them the Emperours party, was
the foundation of that famous Faction betwixt the Guelfs and Ghibilins, in so much that
for want of forreign inundations by the Barbarians,The difference betwixt  and the Pope, the ground of the Guels, and . they turn'd their Arms upon them|selves,
and tore out their own Bowels. Enrico being Excommunicated, was forc'd by his
own Subjects to come into Italy, where bare-footed, and upon his knees he begg'd his
Pardon of the Pope, in the year MLXXX. Notwithstanding all this, not long after,
there happen'd a new quarrel betwixt Enrico and the Pope; whereupon, provok'd by a
new Excommunication, he sent his Son Enrico with an Army, who by the Assistance of

the Romans (whose hatred the Pope had contracted) besieg'd him in his Castle; but Ro|berto
Guiscardo coming from Puglia to his relief, Enrico had not the courage to attend him,
but rais'd his Siege and retir'd into Germany. However the Romans continued obstinate,
and Robert was forc'd to sack the Town, and reduce it to its ancient Ruines, from whence by
several Popes it had been lately restor'd. And because from this Roberto, the Model of Govern|ment
in the Kingdom of Naples did proceed, it will not (in my judgment) be superfluous
to give a particular Narrative, both of his Countrey and Exploits. Upon the differences
betwixt Charlemain's Heirs (as is said before) a new Northern people call'd Normans took
occasion to invade France, and possess'd themselves of that part of it which is now call'd
Normandy. Of this people, part went into Italy, in the time when it was infested by the
Berengarii, the Saracens, and Hunns; setling in Romania, and performing very valiantly
in all those Wars. Of Tancred, one of the Princes of those Normans, were born several
Sons, among which, William call'd Ferabar, and Roberto call'd Guiscardo, were two.
William arriv'd to be Prince, and the Tumults in Italy were in some measure compos'd:
But the Saracens having Sicily intire, and daily invasions made upon Italy, William entred
into Confederacy with the Princes of Capua, and Salerno and with Milorcus a Grecian
(who by the Emperour of Greece was deputed Governour of Puglia, and Calabria) to in|vade
Sicily, and in case of Victory, it was agreed among them, that both Prey and Countrey
should be equaly divided. The Enterprize was prosperous; they beat the Saracens, drove
them out of the Countrey, and possess'd it when they had done. But Milorcus causing
more Forces to be transported privately out of Greece, seiz'd the Island for the Emperour,
and divided only the Spoil. William was not a little disgusted, but reserving his indigna|tion
for a more Convenient time, he departed out of Sicily with the Princes of Capua and
Salerno; who having taken their leaves of him to return to their Homes, in stead of mar|ching
to Romania, as he pretended to them, he fac'd about with his Army towards Puglia,
surpriz'd Melfi, and behav'd himself so well against the Forces of the Emperour, that he made
himself Master of most part of Puglia and Calabria, which Provinces at the time of Ni|colas
II. were Govern'd by his Brother Roberto; and because he had afterward great Con|tention
with his Nephews about the inheritance of those States, he made use of the Pope's
mediation, who readily comply'd, being desirous to oblige Roberto, that he might de|fend
him against the German Emperour, and the people of Rome; and it afterwards
happen'd (as we have said before) that at the instance of Gregory VII, he forc'd Enrico from
Rome, and suppress'd the Sedition of the Inhabitants. Robert was succeeded by two of his
Sons, Roger and William; to their Inheritance they annexed the City of Naples; and all
the Countrey betwixt it and Rome; besides that, they subdu'd Sicily, of which Roger
was made Lord. But William going afterwards to Constantinople, to marry that Empe|rour's
Daughter, Roger took advantage of his absence, seiz'd upon his Contrey, and elated
by so great an acquest, caus'd himself first to be call'd King of Italy; but afterwards con|tenting
himself with the Title of King of Puglia and Sicily, he was the first that gave
Name and Laws to that Kingdom,The Original of the King|dom of Sicily. which to this day it retains, though many times since,
not only the Royal Bloud, but the Nation has been changed; for upon failure of the Norman
Race, that Kingdom devolv'd to the Germans; from them, to the French; from the French,
to the Spaniards; and from the Spaniards, to the Flemens, with whom it remains at this
present. Urban II. though very odious in Rome, was gotten to be Pope; but by reason of
the dissentions there,Urban 2d. Pope. not thinking himself secure in Italy, he remov'd with his whole
Clergy into France. Having assembled many people together at Anvers, he undertook a
Generous Enterprize, and by a learned Oration against the Infidels, kindled such a fire in
their minds, they resolv'd upon an Expedition into Asia against the Saracens, which Ex|pedition
(as all other of the same nature) was call'd afterwards Crociate, because all that
went along in it carry'd a red Cross upon their Arms,The first Croisade. and their Cloths. The Chief Com|manders
in this Enterprize were Gottofredi Eustachio, Alduino di Buglione Earl of Bologna,
and Peter the Hermit, a man of singular veneration both for his prudence and piety. Many
Princes and Nations assisted with their Purses, and many private men serv'd as Voluntiers at
their own Charges. So great an influence had Religion in those days upon the Spirits of
Men, incourag'd by the Example of their several Commanders. At first the Enterprize
was very successfull, all Asia minor, Syria, and part of Egypt fell under the power of the
Christians; during which War, the Order of the Knights of Ierusalem was instituted, and
continued a long time in Rhodes, as a Bulwark against the Turks. Not long after the Or|der
of the Knights Templers was founded, but it lasted not long, by reason of the disso|luteness
of their Manners. At sundry times after these things, upon sundry occasions, many
accidents fell out, in which several Nations, and particular men signaliz'd themselves.
There were ingag'd in this Expedition, the Kings of England and France, the States of

Pisa, Venice, and Genoa, all behaving themselves with great bravery, and sighting with
variety of Fortune, till the time of Saladine the Saracen; but his Courage and Virtue im|prov'd
by intestine differences among the Christians, robb'd them of the glory they had
gain'd at the first, and chased them out of a Countrey, where for Ninety years they had
been so honourably,Pascal d and so happily plac'd. After the death of Pope Urban, Pascal II. was
chosen to succeed him, and Enrico IV. made Emperour, who coming to Rome; and pre|tending
great friendship to the Pope, took his advantage, clapt both him and his Clergy
in Prison, and never discharg'd them till they had impowr'd him to dispose of the
Churches in Germany as he pleas'd himself. About this time Matilda the Countess died,
and gave her Patrimony to the Church. After the deaths of Pascal and Enric, many Popes
and many Emperours succeeded,Alexander 3d. till the Papacy fell to Alexander III. and the Empire to Fre|derick
Barbarossa a Swede. The Popes of those days had many Controversies with the
people of Rome, and the Emperours, which till the time of Barbarossa, rather increas'd than
otherwise. Frederick was an excellent Soldier, but so haughty and high, he could not
brook to give place to the Pope. Notwithstanding he came to Rome to be Crown'd, and
return'd peaceably into Germany. But that humour lasted but little, for he return'd shortly
into Italy, to reduce some Towns in Lombardy, which denied him obedience. In this
juncture, Cardinal di S. Clemente (a Roman born) dividing from Pope Alexander, was
made Pope himself by a Faction in the Conclave. Frederick the Emperour being then in|camp'd
before Crema,A new Anti-Pope. Alexander complain'd to him of the Anti-Pope: Frederick reply'd,
That they should both of them appear personally before him, and that then, hearing faith|fully
what each of them could say, he should be better able to determine which was in the
right. Alexander was not at all satisfied with the Answer, but perceiving the Emperour
inclining to the Adversary, he Excommunicated him, and ran away to King Philip of
France. For all that, Frederick prosecuted his Wars in Lombardy, took and dismantled Milan.
Which put the Cities of Verona, Padua, and Venice, upon a Confederacy for their Common
defence. In the mean time the Anti-Pope died, and Frederick presum'd to Create Guid
of Cremona in his place. The Romans taking advantage of the Pope's absence, and the
Emperour's diversion in Lombardy, had re-assum'd something of their former Authority,
and began to require Obedience in the neighbouring places which had been anciently their
Subjects. And because the Tuscans refus'd to submit, they march'd confusedly against
them, but they being re-inforced by Frederick, gave the Roman Army such a blow, that
since that time Rome could never recover its old Condition either for Populousness or
Wealth. Upon these Events, Pope Alexander was return'd to Rome, presuming he might
be safe there, by reason of the Animosity the Romans retain'd against the Emperour; and
the Employment his Enemies gave him in Lombardy. But Frederick postponing all other
respects, march'd with his Army to besiege Rome. Alexander thought it not convenient to
attend him, but withdrew into Puglia to William, who upon the death of Roger (being
next Heir) was made King. Frederick being much molested, and weaken'd by a Conta|gion
in his Army, rais'd his Siege, and went back into Germany. The Lombards which
were in League against him, to restrain their Excursions, and streighten the Towns of Pavia
and Tortona; caus'd a City to be built (which they intended for the Seat of the War) and
call'd it Alexandria, in honour to Pope Alexander, and defiance to the Emperour. Guido
the new Anti-Pope died likewise, and Iohn (of Fermo) was chosen in his room, who by
the favour of the Imperial party, was permitted to keep his Residence in Monte Fiascone,
whilst Alexander was gone into Tuscany, invited by that people, that by his Authority they
might be the better defended against the Romans. Being there, Embassadors came to him
from Henry King of England, to clear their Masters innocence in the death of Thomas
Becket, Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, with which he was publickly and most infamously
aspersed.The Pope's penance to King Henry of England, upon the complaints about Thomas Becet. To inquire into the truth, the Pope sent two Cardinals into England, who (not|withstanding,
they found not his Majesty in any manifest guilt) yet for the scandal of the
Fact, and that he had not honour'd the said Arch-Bishop with the respect he deserved,
they prescribed as a Penance, That he should call all the Barons of his Kingdom together;
swear his Innocence before them, send 200 Soldiers to Ierusalem, to be paid by him for a
twelve-month, and himself follow in person with as great a Power as he could raise, before
three years were expir'd; that he should disanul all things pass'd in his Kingdom in pre|judice
to the Ecclesiastick liberty, and consent, that any of his Subjects whatever, should
appeal to Rome, when, and as often, as they thought it convenient: all which Conditions
were readily accepted, and that great Prince submitted to a Sentence there is scarce a pri|vate
person but would scorn at this day. But though his Holiness was so formidable to the
Princes abroad, he was not so terrible in Rome; the people in that City would not be
oaksed, nor persuaded to let him live there, though he protested he would meddle no

farther than Ecclesiastical matters; by which it appears, things at a distance are more
dreadful, than near at hand. In the mean time Frederick was return'd into Italy, with
resolution to make a new War upon the Pope but whilst he was busie about his prepara|tions,
his Barons and Clergy gave him advertisement, that they would all forsake him,
unless he reconcil'd himself to the Church; so that changing his design, he was forc'd to
go and make his submission at Venice; and pacification being made, the Pope in the Agree|ment
devested the Emperor of all the Authority he pretended over Rome, and named
William King of Sicily and Puglia, his Confederate. Frederick being an active Prince, and
unable to lie still, embarqu'd himself in the Enterprize into Asia, to spend his Ambition
against the Turk, which he could not do so effectually against the Pope. But being got as
far as the River Cidvo, allur'd by the clearness and excellence of the Waters, he would
needs wash himself in it, and that washing gave him his death. Those Waters being more
beneficial to the Turks, than all Excommunications to the Christians; for whereas
these only cool'd and asswag'd his Ambition, they wash'd it away, and extinguish'd it
quite.
Frederick being dead, nothing remain'd now to be suppres'd, but the contumacy of the
Romans. After much argument and dispute about their Creation of Consuls, it was con|cluded,
the Romans, according to ancient Custom, should have liberty to choose them; but
they should not execute their Office, till they had sworn fealty to the Church. Upon this
accord Iohn the Anti-Pope fled to Monte Albano, and died presently after. In the mean
time, William King of Naples died also; and having left no Sons but Tanacred a Bastard,
the Pope design'd to have possess'd himself of his Kingdom, but by the opposition of the
Barons,Celestin 3d. Pope. Tanacred was made King. Afterwards Celestin III. coming to the Papacy, and
being desirous to wrest that Kingdom from Tanacred, he contriv'd to make Enrico (Fre|dericks
Son) King, promising him the Kingdom of Naples, upon Condition he would
restore such Lands as belong'd to the Church, and to facilitate the business, he took Costanza
(an ancient Maid, daughter to King William) out of a Monastery, and gave her him for his
Wife; by which means the Kingdom of Naples pass'd from the Normans (who had found|ed
it) and fell under the dominion of the Germans. Henricus the Emperor having first
setled his affairs in Germany, came into Italy with his Wife Costanza, and one of his Sons
call'd Frederick, about four years of age, and without much difficulty possess'd himself of
that Kingdom, Tanacred being dead, and only one Child remaining of his Issue, call'd
Roger Not long after Enricus died in Sicily, he was succeeded in that Kingdom by Frederick;
and Otto Duke of Saxony, chosen Emperour by the assistance of Pope Innocent III. But
no sooner had he got the Crown upon his Head, but contrary to the opinion of all men,
he became Enemy to the Pope; seiz'd upon Romania, and gave out Orders for the assault|ing
that Kingdom; Upon which being Excommunicated by the Pope, and deserted by his
Friends, Frederick King of Naples was chosen Emperour in his place. The said Frederick
coming to Rome to be Crown'd, the Pope scrupl'd it, being jealous of his power, and en|deavoured
to persuade him out of Italy, as he had done Otto before; which Frederick dis|daining,
retir'd into Germany, and making War upon Otto, overcame him at last. In the
mean time Innocent died, who besides other magnificent Works, built the Hospital di Santo
Spirito at Rome. Honorius III. succeeded him, in whose Papacy were instituted the Orders
of S. Dominick and S. Francis,Honorius 3d. Pope. in the year MCCXVIII. Honorius Crown'd Frederick
to whom Iohn,The Orders of S. Dominick, and S. Francis, instituted 1218. descended from Baldwin King of Ierusalem (who commanded the remainder
of the Christians in Asia, and retain'd that Title) gave one of his Daughters in marriage,
and the Title of that Kingdom in Dower with her; and from that time, whoever is King
of Naples, has that Title annex'd. In Italy at that time they liv'd in this manner: The
Romans had no more the Creation of Consuls,The Titles of King of Naples and Ierusalem annex'd. but in lieu of it they invested sometimes one,
sometimes more of their Senators with the same power. The League continued all the
while, into which the Cities of Lombardy had entred against Frederick Barbarossa; and
the Cities were these; Milan, Brescia, Mantua, with the greater part of the Cities in Ro|magna,
besides Verona, Vicenza, Padua, and Trevigi. The Cities on the Emperours side were
Cremona, Bergamo, Parma, Reggio, Modena, and Trenta: The rest of the Cities of Lombardy,
Romagna, and the Marquisate of Trevizan, took part according to their interest, sometimes
with this, sometimes with the other party. In the time of Otto III, one Ezelino came
into Italy, of whose Loyns there remaining a Son, call'd also Ezelino, being powerful and
rich, he joyn'd himself with Frederick II, who (as was said before) was become an Ene|my
to the Pope. By the incouragement and assistance of this Ezelino, Frederick came into
Italy; took Verona and Mantua, demolish'd Vicenza, seiz'd upon Padoua, defeated the united
Forces of those parts, and when he had done, advanc'd towards Toscany, whilst in the
mean time Ezelino made himself Master of the Marquisate of Trevizan, Ferrara they

could not take, being defended by Azone da Esti, and some Regiments of the Popes in Lom|bardy.The House of the Esti made Lords of Ferrara.
Whereupon when the Siege was drawn off, his Holiness gave that City in Fee to
Azone da Esti, from whom those who are Lords of it at this day are descended. Frederick
stop'd, and fix'd himself at Pisa, being desirous to make himself Master of Tuscany, and by
the distinctions he made betwixt his Friends and his Foes in that Province, rais'd such am|mosites,The Guels side with the Church, the Gibilins with the Emperor.
as proved afterwards the destruction of all Italy: For both Guelfs and Gibilins in|creas'd
every day, the first siding with the Church, the other with the Emperour, and were
call'd first by those Names, in the City of Pistoia. Frederick being at length remov'd from
Pisa, made great devastations, and several inroads into the Territories of the Church; in
so much that the Pope having no other remedy, proclaim'd the Croifada against him, as his
Predecessors had done against the Saracens. Frederick (left he should be left in the lurch
by his own people as Frederick Barbarossa, and others of his Ancestors had been before,)
entertain'd into his Pay great numbers of the Saracens, and to oblige them to him, and
strengthen his opposition to the Pope, by a party that should not be afraid of his Curss,
he gave them Nocera in that Kingdom, to the end that having a Rtreat in their own
hands,Innocent 4th Pope. they might serve him with more confidence and security. At this time Innocent
IV. was Pope, who being apprehensive of Frederick, remov'd to Genoa, and thence into
France, where he call'd a Counsel at Lyons, and Frederick design'd to have been there, had
he not been retain'd by the Rebellion of Parma. Having had ill Fortune in the suppressing
of that, he march'd away into Tuscany, and from thence into Sicily, where he died
not long after, leaving his Son Currado in Sevia, and in Puglia, his natural Son Manfredi,
whom he had made Duke of Benevento. Currado went to take possession of the Kingdom,
died at Naples, and left only one ltle Son behind him in Germany, who was call'd Cur|rado,
by his own Name. By which means, Manfred first as Tutor to Currado, got into the
Government, and afterwards giving out that his Pupil was dead, he made himself King,
and forc'd the Pope and Neapolitans (who oppos'd it) to consent. Whilst Affairs in that
Kingdom were in that posture, many Commotions happen'd in Lombardy, betwixt the
Guelfs and the Gibilins. The Guelfs were headed by a Legate from the Pope, the Gibilins
by Ezelino, who at that time had in his possession all that part of Lombardy on this side the
Poe. And because while he was entertain'd in this War, the City of Padoua rebell'd, he
caus'd 12000 of them to be slain, and not long after, before the War was ended, died him|self
in the thirtieth year of his age. Upon his death, all those Countreys which had been
in his hands, became free. Manfredi King of Naples continued his malevolence to the
Church, as his Ancestors had done before him, holding Pope Urban IV. in perpetual an|xiety,
so that at length he was constrain'd to convoke the Crociata against him, and to retire
into Perugi, till he could get his Forces together: but finding them come in slowly and
thin, conceiving that to the overcoming of Manfred, greater supplies would be necessary,
he address'd himself to the King of France, making his Brother Charles Duke of Angio,
King of Sicily and Naples, and excited him to come into Italy, and take possession of those
Kingdoms.Clement 5th Pope. Before Charles could get to Rome, the Pope died, and Clement V. succeeded
in his place. In the said Clements time, Charles with 30 Galleys arriv'd at Ostia, having
Ordered the rest of his Forces to meet him by Land. During his residence at Rome, as a
Complement to him, the Romans made him a Senator, and the Pope invested him in that
Kingdom, with condition that he should pay 50 thousand Florins yearly to the Church;
and published a Decree, that for the future, neither Charles, nor any that should succeed him
in that Kingdom, should be capable of being Emperours. After which Charles advancing
against Manfred, fought with him, beat him, and kill'd him near Benvento, thereby making
himself King of Sicily, and that Kingdom. Corradino (to whom that State devolv'd by his
Fathers Testament) gathering what Forces together he could in Germany, march'd into
Italy against Charles, and ingaging him at Tagliacozza, was presently defeated, and (being
afterwards discover'd in his flight) taken and slain. Italy continued quiet, till the Papacy
of Adrian V. who not enduring that Charles should continue in Rome, and govern all (
he did) by vertue of his Senatorship, he remov'd to Vitrbo,Adrian 5th Pope. and solicited Ridolfus the
Emperour to come into Italy against him. In this manner, the Popes sometimes for de|fence
of Religion, sometimes out of their own private ambition, call'd in new Men, and by
consequence new Wars into Italy. And no sooner had they advanc'd any of them, but
they repented of what they had done, and sought immediately to remove him, nor would
they suffer any Province, (which by reason of their weakness they were unable themselves
to subdue) to be injoy'd quietly by any body else. The Princes were all afraid of them, for
whether by fighting, or flying, they commonly overcame, unless circumvented by some Stra|tagem,
as Boniface VIII. and some others were by the Emperours, under pretence of Friend|ship
and Amity. Ridolfus being retain'd by his War with the King of Bohemia, was not

at leisure to visit Italy before Adrian was dead.Nicholas 3d. of the House of . He which succeeded him was Nicolas the
III. of the House of Ursin, a daring, ambitious man; who resolving to take down the
Authority of Charles, contriv'd that Ridolfus the Emperour, should complain of Charles
his Governour in Tuscany, of his siding with the Guelfs, who after the death of Manfred,
had been receiv'd and protected in that Province. To comply with the Emperour, Charles
call'd away his Governour, and the Pope sent his Cardinal Nephew to take possession of
it for the Emperour; to recompense that Kindness, the Emperour restor'd Romania
to the Church, which had been usurp'd by his Predecessors, and the Pope made Bartaldo
Orsino Duke of Romagnia: growing more powerfull by degrees, and believing himself
strong enough to look Charles in the face, he began to expostulate, turn'd him out of
his Senatorship, and publish'd a Decree, that no person for the future of Royal Extraction
should ever be Senator in Rome. Not contented with this, he carri'd his Designs farther,
and was in the mind to have droven Charles out of Sicily; to which end, he held secret in|telligence
with the King of Arragon, who effected it alterwards in the time of his Succes|sor.
He design'd likewise to have made two Kings out of his Family, one of Lombardy,
the other of Tuscany, by whose power and assistance the Church might be defended from
the incursions of the Germans abroad, and the oppression of the French at home. But he
dying before any thing could be done, was the first Pope that gave so manifest demonstra|tion
of Ambition, or that, under pretence of advancing the Church, design'd only to exalt
and magnifie his own Family;The first in|troduction of Popes Ne|phews. and though from this time backward no mention is to be
found of Nephew, or any other of his Holiness Kindred, yet forward all History is full of
them; and as formerly the Popes have endeavour'd to leave them Princes, they would
leave them Popes now adays if they could, and make the Papacy hereditary.
But the Principalities they erected, have been hitherto short-liv'd; for the Popes seldom
living long, the first gust of wind shakes them, for want of their Authority and Courage to
sustain them.Martin 10th. Pope. This Pope being dead Martin X. succeeded, who being born a French-man,
was a friend to the French, and Charles (in the Rebellion of Romania) sent an Army to his
Assistance, who having besieg'd Furli, Guido Bonatti an Astrologer being in the Town,
appointed the Garrison a certain time to sally upon them; and following his direction,
they did it with such success, that the whole French Army was either taken or kill'd. About
this time, the practices betwixt Pope Nicholas and Peter King of Arragon, were put in exe|cution;
the Sicilians by that means kill'd all the French they found in that Island; and
Peter made himself Lord of it, upon pretence it belonged to Constansa, Manfreds Daughter,
whom he had married; but Charles in his preparation for its recovery, died; left Charles II.
his Son, at that time a Prisoner in Sicily, who for his enlargement, promis'd to surrender
himself again, if in three years time he prevail'd not with the Pope to invest the House of
Arragon with the Kingdom of Sicily. Ridolfus the Emperour, in stead of coming into Italy
himself, to recover the reputation of the Empire, sent an Embassadour thither with full
power to enfranchize such Cities as would buy out their Freedom: Upon which, many
Cities redeem'd themselves, and chang'd their Laws, with their Liberty. Adulfus Duke
of Saxony, succeeded in the Empire, and in the Popedom, Piero del Murone, by the Name
of Pope Celestine;Pope Ce|lestine resigns to Boniface 8th. but having been a Hermit, and exceedingly devout, in six months time
he renounced, and Boniface VIII. was chosen in his room. The Heavens (foreseeing the
time would come Italy should be deliver'd both from the Germans and French, and remain
intirely in the hands of its Natives; that the Pope though freed from forreign impedi|diments,
might not be able to usurp, and establish himself in the Power which he exercised
then) rais'd up two great Families in Rome, the Colonni, and the Ursini, that by their Au|thority
and Allyance they might be able to circumscribe his Holiness, and keep him within
his bounds. Pope Boniface was sensible of them, and apply'd himself very zealously
to have extirpated the Colonni, excommunicating them first, and then proclaiming the
Crociata against them; which, though it might be some prejudice to them, was more to
the Church: For those Swords which had been drawn in vindication of the Gospel, and
done honourable things; when for private ambition they were unsheath'd against Chri|stians,
they lost their first sharpness, and would not cut at all; and so it came to pass, their
immoderate desire of satiating their Appetite, by degrees lessened the Popes power, and
disarm'd them.
Two of that House which were Cardinals, he degraded; Sciarra (the chief of them)
escaping in disguise, being discover'd, was taken by the Spanish Privateers, and clap'd to an
Oar; but being known at Marsellis, he was rescu'd, and sent away to the King of France,
who by Boniface was Excommunicated thereupon, and depriv'd of his Kingdom. Philip
King of France, considering very well that in all open Wars with the Popes, he had either
run some eminent danger or come home by the loss; began to look about for some Artifice,

and at length, pretending great readiness to comply, and counterfeiting a Treaty, he sent
Sciarra privately into Italy, who being arriv'd at Anagnia (where at that time the Pope had his
Residence) gathering his Friends together in the night, he seiz'd upon his Holiness, who (tho
inlarg'd afterwards by the people of the Town) died shortly in a Dilirium with meer sense
and indigation. This Boniface was the first Pope which ordain'd Jubilees in the year
M.CCC.The first Ju|bilees ordain'd by Boniface e|very 100 years and decreed they should be celebrated every hundred years. These times pro|duc'd
many troubles betwixt the Guelfs and the Gibilin's, and Italy being forsaken by the
Emperours, many Towns recover'd their liberties, and many were usurp'd. Pope Bene|dict
restor'd their Caps to the Cardinals of the House of Colonni, absolv'd King Philip, and
gave him his Blessing.Benedict cho|sen, dies, and is succeeded by Clement 5th. who remov'd his residence n|to France, 1306. Benedict was succeeded by Clement V. who being a French-man re|mov'd
his Court into France, Anno MCCCVI. During these Transactions Charles II.
King of Naples died, and left the Succession to Robert his Son. The Empire was in the
mean time fallen to Arrigo of Luxemburg, who came to Rome to be Crown'd, though the
Pope was not there; upon whose arrival many commotions followed in Lombardy, and all
banished persons, whether Guelfs or Gibilins, being restor'd to their former Habitations, con|spiring
to supplant one another, they fill'd the whole Province with the Calamities of War,
notwithstanding the Emperour imploy'd his utmost power to prevent it. Arrigo removing
out of Lombardy by the way of Genova, return'd to Pisa, with design to have driven King
Rbrt out of Tascany, but not succeeding in that, he march'd to Rome, but continued there
a few dayes only, for the Ursini by the help of King Robert forc'd him to remove, and he
march'd back again to Pisa, where, for his more secure Warring upon Tuscany, and sup|planting
that King, he caus'd it to be assaulted on the other side by Frederick King of Sicily.
But in the height of his Designs, when he thought himself sure both of Tuscany and its
King, he died, and the succession went to Lodovick of Bavaria. About this time Iohn XXII.
was created Pope, in whose Papacy, the Emperour ceased not to persecute the Guelfs, and
the Church, but King Robert and the Florentines interposing in their defence, great Wars
ensued in Lombardy, under the Conduct of the Visconti against the Guelfs, and against the
Florntines in Tuscany,The  a great Famiy in Milan, made Princes of that City by the ex|tirpation of the Torri. by Castruccio di Lucca. And because the Family of the Visconti were
the Original of the Dukedom of Milan, one of the five Principalities that govern'd all Italy
afterwards, I think it not amiss to deduce it a little higher. After the League amaong the
Cities in Lombardy (which I have mentioned before) for their mutual defence against Fre|derick
Barbarossa Milan being rescued from the ruine that impended; to revenge it self of the
injuries it had receiv'd, enter'd into that Confederacy, which put a stop to the Emperours
career, and preserv'd the Churches interest in Lombardy for a while. In the process of those
Wars, the Family of the Torri grew very powerful, increasing daily more and more, while
the Emperour's Authority was small in those parts. But Frederick II. arriving in Italy, and
the Ghibilin Faction (by the assistance of Ezelino) prevailing, it began to dilate and spread it
self in all the Cities, and particularly in Milan; the Family of the Visconti iding with that par|ty,
drove the Family of the Torri out of that Town: But long they were not banish'd, for
by an accord made betwixt the Emperour and Pope, they were restor'd. Afterwards when
the Pope remov'd with his Court into France, and Arrigo of Luxemburg came to Rome to
be Crown'd, he was receiv'd into Milan by Maffeo Visconti, the Head of that House, and
Guido della Torre, the Chief of the other. Yet how kindly soever they carry'd it outwardly,
Masseo had a secret design, by the Emperour's being there, to drive out the Torri, believing
the Enterprize the more practicable, because Guido was of the Enemies Faction. He took
the advantage of the peoples complaints against the behaviour of the Germans, incouraging
them slily to take Arms, and rescue themselves from their barbarous servitude. Having
dispos'd things as he desired, he caused a tumult to be raised by one of his Confidents, upon
which the whole Town was to be in Arms, and pretendedly against the Germans. The
Tumult was no sooner begun, but Maffeo, his Sons, Servants, and Partizans were imme|diately
in Arms, and ran to Arrigo, assuring him that Tumult was raised by the Torri, who
not content with their private Condition, took that occasion to ruine him as an Enemy
to the Guelfs, and make themselves Princes of that City. But he desired him to be secure,
for they and their party would not fail to defend him, when ever he requir'd it. Arrigo
believed all to be true that Maffeo had told him, joyned his Forces with the Visconti, fell upon
the Torri (who were dispersed up and down the City to suppress the Tumult) killed those
of them which they met, banished the rest, and seized their Estates: So that Maffeo Visconti
made himself Prince. After him, there succeeded Galeazo, and Aza, and after them Luchino
and Iohn, who was afterwards Arch-Bishop of that City: Luchino died before him, and left
two Sons, Barnardo and Galeazo; Galeazo dying not long after, left one Son, called Giovan
Galeazo,The  Milan. Conti di Vertu, who after the death of the Arch-Bishop, killed his Unkle Barnardo,
made himself Prince, and was the first that took upon him the Title of Duke of Milan. He

left two Sons only, Philip, and Giovan Maria Angelo, who being slain by the people of
Milan,The Duke|dom of Milan falls to the Sfor|zs. the Government remain'd wholly to Philip. He dying without issue Male, the
Dukedom was translated from the House of the Visconti, to the Sforza's; but of the manner
and occasions of that, hereafter. To return therefore, where I left.
Lewis the Emperour, to give reputation to his party, and to be formally Crown'd, came into
Italy, and being at Milan, to drain the City of its Money, he pretended to set them at Li|berty,
and clap'd the Visconti in Prison. Afterwards, by the Mediation of Castruccio da
Luca, he releas'd them, march'd to Rome, and (that he might more easily disturb the tran|quillity
of Italy) he made Piero della Carvaro, Anti-Pope: by whose reputation, and the interest
of the Visconti, he presum'd he should be able to keep under both the Tuscans, and Lom|bards.
But Castruccio died in the nick, and his death was the Emperours ruine, for Pisa
and Lucca rebelled out of hand. The Pisans took the Anti-pope, and sent him Prisoner to
the Pope into France, so that the Emperour despairing of his Affairs in Italy, he left them
all as they were, and retired into Germany. He was scarce gone, before Iohn King of
Bohemia came into Italy with an Army (being invited by the Ghibilins in Brescia) and
possest himself both of that City and Bergamo. The Pope (however he dissembled it)
was not averse to his coming, and therefore his Legat at Bologna favoured him privately,
looking upon him as a good Antidote against the Emperours return. These under-hand
practices chang'd the Condition of Italy; for the Florentines and King Robert, perceiving
the Legat a favourer of the Ghibilin Faction, turn'd Enemies to all people that profess'd
themselves their Friends. In so much as without respect to either Ghibilins or Guelfs,
many Princes associated with them; among the rest were the Families of the Visconti Scala,
Philippo di Gonsaga of the House of Mantua, the Families of Carara and Este, whereupon
the Pope Excommunicated them all. The King apprehensive of their League, return'd
home to reinforce himself, and coming back with more Force into Italy, found his Enter|prize
very difficult notwithstanding; so that growing weary of the business (though much
to the dissatisfaction of the Legat) he return'd into Bohemia, leaving Garrisons only in Mo|dena
and Reggio, recommending Parma to the Care of Marsilio, and Piero de Rossi, who were
eminent men in that City. As soon as he was departed, Bologna enter'd into the Confe|deracy,
and the Colleagues divided the four Towns that were remaining to the Church
among themselves, Parma to the Scali, Reggio to the Gonzagi, Modena to the Esti, and
Luca to the Florentines. But many differences follow'd upon that division, which for the
greatest part were compos'd afterwards by the Venetians. And now I speak of the Vene|tians,
it may appear indecorous to some people, that among all the occurrences and revolu|tions
in Italy, I have deferr'd speaking of them, notwithstanding their Government and
Power places them above any other Republick or Principality in that Countrey.
That that Exception may be remov'd, and the occasion appear, it will be necessary to
look back for some time, to make their Original conspicuous, and the reasons for which
they reserv'd themselves so long from interposing in the Affairs of Italy.The Original of the Veneti|as. Attila King of the
Hunni having besieg'd Aquilegia, the Inhabitants after a generous defence, being reduc'd
to distress, and despairing of Relief, conveighing their Goods, as well as they could, to
certain Rocks in that point of the Adriatick Sea which were not inhabited, they escap'd
after them themselves. The Padouans seeing the fire so near them, concluding when
Aquilegia was taken, his next visit would be to them, sent away their Goods, Wives,
Children, and unserviceable people to a place in the same Sea, call'd Rivo Alto, leaving the
young men, and such as were able to bear Arms, for the defence of the Town. The Inha|bitants
of Montfelice, and the Hills about it, fearing the same destiny, remov'd to the same
Islands Aquilegia being taken, and Padoua, Montfelice, Vicenza, and Verona overcome
and sack'd by Atila's Army; those which remain'd of the Padouans, and the most consi|derable
of the rest, setled their Habitations in certain Fenns and Marshes about the afore|said
Rivo Alto: and all the people about that Province, which was anciently call'd Venetia,
being driven out of their Countrey by the same Calamities, joyn'd themselves with them;
changing (by necessity) their pleasant and plentiful Habitations, for rude and barren places,
void of all Commodity and Convenience. But their number being great, and their
Quarter but small, in a short time they made it not only habitable, but delightful; framing
such Laws and Orders to themselves, as secur'd them against miseries of their Neighbours,
and in a short time made them considerable, both for reputation and force. So that besid
their first inhabitants, many people resorting to them from the Cities of Lombardy, upon
occasion of the Cruelty of Clefi King of the Lombards, they multiply'd so fast, that when
Pepin King of France at the solicitation of the Pope, undertooke to drive the Lombards out
of Italy, in the Treaties betwixt him and the Emperour of Greece, it was agreed that the
Duke of Benevento and the Venetians, should be subject neither to the one nor the other,

but injoy their Liberty to themselves. Moreover, Necessity having determin'd their Habita|tions
among the Waters, having no Land to supply them, it forc'd them to look about
which way they might live, and applying to Navigation, they began to trade about the
World, and not only furnish'd themselves with necessary Provisions, but by degrees
brought thither such variety of Merchandize, that other people which had need of them
came to them to be supply'd. At first, having no thoughts of Dominion, they were wholly
intent upon what might facilitate their Trade, and in order thereunto, they acquir'd se|veral
Ports,Candia given to the Veneti|ans by the French. both in Greece and Syria, and in their passage into Asia the French making use
of their Ships, they gave them (by way of Recompence) the Island of Candia. While they
lived at this rate, their Name was grown formidable at Sea, and so venerable at Land, that
in most Controversies betwixt their Neighbours they were the only Arbitrators: as it hap|pen'd
in the difference betwixt the Confederates upon the division of the Towns, where
the cause being referred to them, they awarded Bergamo and Brescia to the Visconti. But
having afterwards in process of time conquer'd Padoua, Vicenza, Trivegi, and after them
Verona, Bergamo and Brescia, besides several Towns in Romagna and else where, their power
began to be so considerable, that not only the Princes of Italy, but the greatest and most re|mote
Kings were afraid to provoke them. Whereupon, entring into a Conspiracy against
them, the Venetians lost all in one day, that in so many Years, and with so vast Expence
they had been gaining; and though in our times they may have recover'd it in part, yet not
having regain'd their Reputation and Power, they live at the mercy of other people (as indeed
all the Princes of Italy do.)Benedict 12th Pope. Benedict XII. being Pope, looking upon Italy as lost, and fear|ing
that Lodovic the Emperour should make himself Master of it, he resolv'd to enter into
strict Amity with all those who held any Lands that belong'd formerly to the Empire, pre|suming
their fear to be dispossess'd, would make them faithful in the defence of Italy, and
zealous to keep him out: accordingly he publish'd a Decree to confirm all the usurp'd Titles
in Lombardy, and to continue their Possession. But that Pope died before his Promise could
be made good,Clement 6th Pope. and Clement VI. succeeded him. The Emperour observing with what
librality the Pope had dispos'd of the Lands belonging to the Empire, that he might not be
behind him in so generous a point, he gave all Lands that had been usurp'd from the Church,
to such persons as had usurp'd them, to hold them of the Empire, as the other of the Pope.
By which Donation Galeotto Maletesti and his Brothers became Lords of Rimini, Pesaro,
and Fano, Antonio da Montefeltro of la Marca and Urbin, Gentil da Varano of Camerino,
Giovanni Manfredi of Faenza, Guido di Polenta of Ravenna, Sinebaldo Or delaffi of Furli and
Cesena, Lodovico Aledosi of Imola, besides many others in other places: so that of all the
Lands which belong'd to the Church, there was scarce any left without an interloper; by
which means, till the time of Alexander VI. the Church was very weak, but he recover'd
its Authority in our days, with the destruction of most of their Posterity. At the time of
this Concession, the Emperour was at Taranto, where he gave out, his Design was for Italy,
which was the occasion of great Wars in Lombardy, in which the Visconti made them|selves
Lords of Parma. About this time, Robert King of Naples died, and left two Grand
Children by his Son Charles, (who died not long before) leaving his eldest Daughter Gio|vanna
Heir to the Crown, with injunction to marry Andra, Son to the King of Hungary,
who was his Nephew. But they liv'd not long together, before Andrea was poison'd by
her, and she married again to Lodovic Prince of Taranto, her near Kins-man. But Lewis
King of Hungary, Brother to Andrea, to revenge his death, came into Italy with an Army,
and drave Giovanna and her Husband out of the Kingdom. About these times there
happen'd a very memorable passage in Rome; One Nicholas di Lorenzo Chancellor in the
Capitol, having forc'd the Senate out of Rome, under the Title of Tribune made himself
head of that Common-wealth, reducing it into its ancient form, with so much Justice and
Virtue, that not only the neighbouring Provinces, but all Italy sent Embassadours to him.
The ancient Provinces seeing that City so strangely reviv'd, began to lift up their Heads,
and pay it a respect, some out of fear, and some out of hopes. But Nicholas, notwithstand|ing
the greatness of his Reputation, not able to comport with so great an Authority, desert|ed
it himself; for being overburthen'd with the weight of it, he left it in the very beginning,
and without any constraint, stole privately away to the King of Bohemia, who, by the Popes
Order, in affront to Lewis of Bavaria, was made Emperour, and to gratifie his Patron, he
secur'd Nicholas, and Clapt him in prison. Not long after, as it had been in imitation of
Nicholas, one Francesco Baroncegli possest himself of the Tribuneship, and turn'd the Sena|tors
out of Rome: so that the Pope, as the readiest way to suppress him, was glad to dis|charge
Nicholas of his imprisonment, and sent him to Rome, to resume his old Office;
whereupon, Nicholas undertook the Government once more, and caus'd Francesco to be
executed. But the Colonnesi becoming his Enemies by degrees, he himself was put to death

by them, and the Senate restor'd to the Exercise of its former Authority. In the mean
time of the King of Hungary, having depos'd Queen Giovanna, return'd to his own Kingdom:
But the Pope desir'd to have the Queen his Neighbour, rather than that King, and order'd
things so, that the Kingdom was restor'd, upon Condition her Husband Lewis renouncing
the Title of King should content himself with that of Taranto.The Jubilee reduc'd to 50 years. The Year MCCCL. be|ing
come, his Holiness thought fit that the Jubilee appointed by Pope Boniface VIII. to be
kept every hundred years, should be reduc'd to fifty, and, having pass'd a Decree to that
purpose, in gratitude for so great a Benefit, the Romans were contented he should send
four Cardinals to Rome, to reform their City, and create what Senators he pleas'd. After
which the Pope declar'd Lodovic of Taranto King of Naples again, and Giovanna, highly
oblig'd by that favour,Avignon giv|en to the Pope by the Queen of Naples. gave the Church Avignon, which was part of her Patrimony. By
this time Luchno Visconti being dead, Iohn Arch-Bishop of Milan remain'd sole Lord,
and, making several Wars upon Tuscany and his Neighbours, became very considerable.
After his death, the Government fell to his two Nephews, Bernardo and Galeazzo, but Ga|leazzo
dying a while after, he left his Son Iohn Galeazzo to share with his Unkle in the State.
In these dayes,Innocent 6th Pope. Charles King of Bohemia was created Emperour, and Innocent VI. Pope,
who having sent Cardinal Giles (a Spaniard) into Italy, by his Virtue, and the excellence
of his Conduct, he recover'd the reputation of the Church, not only in Rome and Romagna,
but all Italy over. He recover'd Bologna, that had been usurp'd by the Arch-Bishop of
Milan. He constrain'd the Romans to admit a forreign Senator every year of the Popes no|mination.
He made an honourable Agreement with the Visconti. He fought and took
Prisoner Iohn Aguto an English-man, who with four thousand English was entertain'd in
Tuscany,Urban 5th Pope. upon the Ghibilin accompt. After these Successes, Urban V. being Pope, he re|solv'd
to visit both Italy and Rome, where Charles the Emperour came to meet him, and
having continued together several Months,Gregory 12th Pope. Charles return'd into his Kingdom, and the
Pope to Avignon. Urban died, and Gregory XII. suceeded, and because Cardinal Egidio was
dead, Italy relaps'd into its former distractions, occasion'd by the Caballing of the people
against the Visconti.The Pope re|turns to Rome, after 71 years absence in France. Whereupon the Pope at first sent a Legat into Italy with six thousand
Britans, after whom he follow'd in Person, and re-establish'd his Residence at Rome, in the
year MCCCLXXVI. after it had been kept in France, LXXI. years.
After the death of this Pope, Urban VI. was created. Not long after at Fondi, ten Car|dinals
quarrelling with his Election,Urban 6th Pope: Clement 7th Anti-Pope. and pretending it was not fair, created Clement VII.
The Genoveses in the mean time (who for several years had lived quietly under the Govern|ment
of the Visconti) rebell'd. Betwixt them and the Venetian, there happen'd great Wars
about the Island of Tenedos;Guns first us'd betwixt the Genoveses and Venetians in which War by Degrees all Italy became concern'd, and
there it was that great Guns were first us'd, they being a German Invention. Though for a
while the Genoveses were predominant, and held Venice blockt up for several Months toge|ther;
yet in the conclusion, the Venetian had the better, and made an advantagious Peace,
by the assistance of the Pope. In the year 1381 (as we have said before) there was a Schism
in the Church, and Giovanna the Queen favour'd the Anti-Pope. Whereupon, Pope Urban
practis'd against her, and sent Carlo Durazzo (who was of the Royal House of Naples)
with an Army into her Kingdom, who possest himself of her Countrey, and drove her
away into France. The King of France undertaking her quarrel, sent Lodovic d' Angio to
repossess the Queen, and force Urban out of Rome, and set up the Anti-Pope. But Lodovic
dying in the middle of the Enterprize, his Army broke up, and return'd into France. Urban
thereupon goes over to Naples, and claps nine Cardinals in Prison, for having sided with
France and the Anti-Pope. After that, he took it ill of the King, that he refus'd to make
one of his Nephews Prince of Capua, but concealing his disgust, he desir'd Nocera of him for
his Habitation, which as soon as he was possess'd of, he fortified, and began to cast about which
way to deprive him of his Kingdom. The King taking the Alarm, advanc'd against Nocera
and besieg'd it, but the Pope escap'd to Genoua, where he put the Cardinals which were
his Prisoners to death. From thence he went to Rome, and created 28 new Cardinals. In
the mean time Charles King of Naples went into Hungary, was proclaim'd King there, and
not long after kill'd. He left the Kingdom of Naples to his Wife, and two Children he
had by her, one call'd Ladislao, and the other Giovanna.
Iohn Galeazzo Visconti in the mean time had kill'd his Unkle Bernardo, and possess'd him|self
of Milan, and not content to have made himself Duke of Milan, he attempted upon
Tuscany; but when he was in a fair way to have conquer'd it, and to have made himself
King of all Italy,Urban and Clementn suc|ceeded by Boniface 9th  Benedict 13th. he died. Urban VI. died also, and was succeeded by Boniface IX. Cl|ment
VII. the Anti-Pope died likewise at Avignon, and Benedict XIII. was created in his
room. Italy all this while was full of Soldiers of Fortune, English, Dutch, and Britans,
some of them Commanded by Princes, which upon several occasions had been invited

thither, and some of them which had been sent by the Popes, when their residence was at
Avignon. With this medly of Nations the Princes of Italy maintain'd their Wars many times,
till at length Lodovico da Conio Romagnuolo having train'd up a Party of Italians, call'd the
Soldiers of Saint George, by his Valour and Discipline lessen'd the Reputation of the
Forreigners, and made them afterwards more useful and considerable in the Italian Wars.
The Pope upon certain differences which arose betwixt him and the Romans, remov'd to
Scesi, where he remain'd till the Jubilee in the year 1400. at which time, to invite him back
again for the benfit of their City, the Romans condescended that he should have the annual
nomination of a forreign Senator, and be permitted to fortifie the Castle of St. Angelo;
upon which Conditions being return'd, to inrich the Church, he ordain'd, That in every
Vacancy, each Benefice should pay an Annat into the Chamber Ecclesiastical. After the
death of Iohn Galeazzo Duke of Milan, though he left two Sons Giovan-Mari-Angelo,
and Philip, the State was divided into many Factions. In the troubles which followed,
Giovan-Mari-Angelo was slain, and Philip for some time kept Prisoner in the Castle of
Pavia; but by the Valour and Allegiance of the Governour, he escap'd. Among the rest
who had seiz'd the Cities which belong'd formerly to Iohn Galeazzo, William della Scala
was one, who having been banish'd, and retiring to Francesco de Carrara Lord of Padua,
by his means he recover'd the State of Verona, but he enjoy'd it a short time; for Francesco
caus'd him to be poison'd, and assum'd the Government himself. The Vicentini hereupon
(having till then liv'd quietly under the protection of the Visconti) growing jealous of the
greatness of the Lord of Padua, submitted themselves to the Venetians, who at their insti|gation
made War upon him, and beat him first out of Verona, and at length out of Padua.
By this time Pope Boniface died, and Innocent VII.Boniface dies, Innocent 7th succeeds him, and Gre|gory the 12th. Innocent. was elected in his place. The people of
Rome made a solemn Address to him for the Restitution of their Liberty and Forts, and be|ing
deny'd, they call'd in Ladislans King of Naples to their Assistance; but their differences
being afterwards compos'd, the Pope return'd to Rome, from whence for fear of the people
he fled to Viterbo, where he had made his Nephew Lodovic, Conte della Marca; after which
he died, and Gregory XII. succeeded, upon Condition he should resign when ever the Anti-Pope
should be persuaded to do the same. At the intercession of the Cardinals, to try
whether it was possible to accommodate their differences, and reunite the Church, Benedict
the Anti-Pope came to Porto Veneri, and Gregory to Lucca, where many Expedients were
propos'd, but nothing concluded; whereupon the Cardinals forsook them both, of one
side and the other, Benedict retired into Spain, and Gregory to Rimini. The Cardinals by
the favour of Baldassare Cossa, Cardinal and Legat of Bologna call'd a Counsel at Pisa, in
which they created Alexander V. who immediately excommunicated King Ladislaus, in|vested
Luigid' Augio with his Kingdom, and by the assistance of the Florentines, Genoueses,
Venetians and Baldassare Cossa the Legat, they assaulted Ladislaus, and drove him out of
Rome.Alexander 5th elected, and succeeded by Iohn 23d. But in the heat of the War, Alexander died, and Baldassare Cossa was created Pope,
with the name of Iohn XXIII. Iohn was created at Bologna, but remov'd to Rome, where
he found Luigi d' Angio with the Forces of Provence; having joyn'd himself with him, they
march'd out against King Ladislaus, fought with him, and routed his Army; but for want of
good Conduct, not persuing their Victory, King Ladislaus rally'd, recover'd Rome, and
forc'd the Pope away to Bologna, and Luigi to Provence. The Pope casting about with
himself which way he might restrain and lessen the power of King Ladislaus, caus'd Sigis|mund
King of Hungary to be chosen Emperour, invited him into Italy, to which purpose
they had a Conference at Mantua, where it was concluded, a General Council should be
call'd for uniting the Church; upon the accomplishment of which, it was presum'd they
should be better able to defend themselves against the incroachments of their Enemies.
At this time,Three Popes at once. there were three Popes in being at once; Gregory, Benedict, and Iohn,
which kept the Church very low, both in force and reputation. The place appointed for
their Convention was Constance, a City in Germany, contrary to the intention of Pope
Iohn; and though by the death of King Ladislaus, the great Reason was taken away that
mov'd the Pope to that proposition, nevertheless, things being gone so far, and he under
an obligation, he could not handsomly come off, but was forc'd to go to it. Being ar|riv'd
at Constance, it was not many months before he found his Error, and endeavoured to
have escap'd; but being discovered and taken, he was put in Prison, and compell'd to re|nounce.
Gregory, one of the Anti-Popes renounced by Proxy, but Benedict, the other Anti-Pope
refus'd, and was condemned for a Heretick; at last finding himself abandon'd by all the
Cardinals, he renounc'd likewise, and the Counsel created a new Pope, Viz. Oddo of the
House of Coloma,Martin 5th. who took the name of Martin V. upon which, the Schisms were compos'd,
and the Church united, after it had been divided fourty years, and several Popes living at
one and the same time. As we said before, Philip Visconti was at this time in the Castle of

Pava. But upon the death of Fantino Care (who in the troubles of Lombardy had made
himself Lord of Vercelli; Alexandria, Novara; and Tortona, and contracted great wealth)
having no Sons, he bequeath'd his Dominions to his Wife Beatrix, injoyning his Friends
to use their utmost endeavour to Marry her to Philip; by which Marriage, Philip being
much strengthen'd, he recover'd Milan, and all the whole Province of Lombardy: after
which, to recompense her great Benefits (according to the example of other Princes) he
accus'd his Wife Beatrix of Adultery, and put her to death. Being arriv'd at that height
both of Power and Grandeur, he began to contrive against Toscany, and pursue the designs
of his Father Iohn Galeazzo. Ladislaus King of Naples at his death, had left to his
Sister Giovanna (besides his Kingdom) a formidable Army Commanded by the chief Cap|tains
in Italy, and among the rest, by Sforza da Contignuolo, a person of particular repute
for his Valour in those Wars. The Queen (to clear her self of an aspersion of too much
intimacy with one Panolfello which she advanc'd) took to her Husband Giacopa della
Marcia, a Frenchman, of Royal Extraction, but upon condition he should content himself
to be call'd Prince of Tarano, and leave the Title and Government of the Kingdom to her.
But the Soldiers as soon as he was arrived in Naples called him King, which occasioned great
differences betwixt him and the Queen, sometimes one prevailing, and sometimes the other.
But at length the Government rested in the Queen, and she became a severe Enemy to the
Pope. Whereupon Sforza to drive her into a necessity, and force her to his own terms,
laid down his Commission, and refused to serve her against him; by which means being
(as it were) disarmed in a moment,The Queen of Naples calls in the K. of Ar|ragon to her assistance, a|dopts him, and makes Braccio da Montone her General. having no other remedy she applyed her self to Alphonso
King of Arragon and Sicily, adopted him her Son, and to Command her Army, she enter|tained
Braccio da Montone, as Eminent a Soldier as Sforza, and an Adversary of the Popes,
upon accompt of certain Towns (as Perugia and others) which he had usurped from the
Church. After this, a Peace was concluded betwixt her and the Pope; but Alphonso suspe|cting
least she should serve him, as she had done her Husband, began privately to contrive
how he might possess himself of the Forts: But the Queen was cunning, and prevented him
by fortifying her self in the Castle of Naples. Jealousies increasing in this manner, and
no-body interposing, they came to an Ingagement, and the Queen by the help of Sforza
(who was returned to her Service) overcame Alphonso, drove him out of Naples, abdicated
him, and adopted Lodovic d' Angio in his place. Hereupon new Wars ensued betwixt
Braccio (who was of Alphonso's party) and Sforza (who was for the Queen,) In the process
of the War Sforza passing the River Pescara, was by accident drowned. His death was a
great prejudice to the affairs of the Queen, who thereupon would have run great hazard of
being droven out of her Kingdom, had not her loss been supplyed by Philip Visconti, Duke
of Milan, who forced Alphonso back again into Arragon. But Braccio, not at all discouraged
at Alphonso's departure, continued War upon the Queen, and besieged Aquila. The Pope
looking upon Braccio's greatness, as a diminution to the Church, entertained Francisco (the
Son of Sforza) into his pay, who marching with an Army to the relief of Aquila, ingaged
Braccio, routed his Army, and slew him. Of Braccio's party, there remained only Otho his
Son, from whom the Pope took Perugia, but left him the Government of Montone. But
he also was not long after slain in Romania, in the Florentine assistance; so that of all those
who fought under the Discipline of Braccio, Nicholas Piccinino was the man now of greatest
reputation. Being come thus near with our Narrative to the times we designed, that which
remains being considerable in nothing but the Wars which the Florentines and the Vene|tians
had with Philip Duke of Milan, (of which, our Relation shall be particular when we
come to treat of Florence,) we shall forbear to enlarge any farther, and only in short, reduce
it to Memory, in what state and posture Italy then stood with its Princes, and Armies.
Among the principal States,The State of Ittaly. Queen Giovanna held the Kingdom of Naples, La Marca, the
Patrimony, and Romagna. Part of their Towns belonged to the Church, part to their par|ticular
Governours, or others which had Usurped them: as Ferrara, Modena, Reggio, to the
Family of the Esti, Faenzi to the Manfredi, Imola to the Alidosi, Furli to the Ordelaffi,
Rimini and Pesaro to the Malatesti, and Camerino to the House Varana. Lombardy was di|vided,
part under Duke Philip, and part under the Venetian. All the rest who had had any
soveraignty or principality in those parts, being extinct, except only the House of Gonza|gua,
which governed in Mantua at that time. Of Tuscany the greatest part was under the
Dominion of the Florentine; Lucca only, and Siena lived free under their own Laws: Lucca
under the Guinigi, and Siena of it self. The Genoueses, being free sometimes, sometimes
under the Authority of the French, and sometimes of the Visconti; they lived without any
great reputation, and were reckoned among the meaner and most inconsiderable states of that
Countrey. Their principal Potentates were not themselves in Command, but their Armies
managed by their Generals. Duke Philip consined himself to his Chamber, and not being

to be seen, his Wars were manag'd by Commissioners. The Venetians altering their Scene,
and making War by Land, they disbarqued that Army which had made them so glorious
by Sea; and according to the Custom of their Countrey, gave the Command of it to other
people. The Pope, being a Religious person, and Giovanna Queen of Naples a woman, were
not so proper to Command in person, and therefore did that by necessity which others did
by indiscretion. The Florentines were under the same necessity, for their frequent divisions
having exhausted their Nobility, and the Government of the City remaining in the hands of
such as were bred up to Merchandize; in their Wars they were forc'd to follow the fortune
and direction of strangets: So that the Armies all Italy over, were in the hands of the
smaller Princes, or such as had no Soveraignty at all. Those smaller Princes embracing
those Commands, not from any impulse or stimulation of Glory, but to live plentifully and
safe. The others Education having been small, not knowing what other course to take,
they took up Arms, hoping thereby to gain either Honour or Estate. Among these the
most eminent were Carmignuola, Francisco Sforza, Nicholo Piccinino, brought up under
Braccio, Agnolo della Pergola, Lorenzo, and Micheletto Attenduli, Il Tartaglia, Giaccopaccio,
Ceccolino da Perugia, Nicolo da Tolentino, Guido Torello, Antonio dal Ponte ad Hera, and
many others. With these may be reckon'd those Princes which I have mention'd before,
to which may be added the Barons of Rome, the Orsini, Colonnesi, and other Lords and
Gentlemen of the Kingdom of Lombardy, who depending upon the Wars, had setled a
kind of a League and Intelligence betwixt themselves, model'd it with that artifice, and
temporized so exactly, that most commonly who ever were Enemies, both sides were sure
to be losers. By this means, the Art of War became so mean and unserviceable, every
little Officer that had but the least spark of Experience could have easily corrected it. Of
these lazy Princes, and their despicable Officers shall be the subject of my ensuing discourse;
but before I come to it, it will be necessary (according to my promise at first) to deduce
Florence from its Original, and give every one a clear prospect what was the State of that
City in those times, and by what means it arriv'd at it, thorough the imbroilments of a
thousand years, in which Italy was involv'd.




THE
HISTORY
OF
FLORENCE.
Book II.
AMong the great and admirable orders of former Kingdoms and Common-wealths
(though in our times it is discontinued and lost) it was the Custom upon every
occasion to build new Towns and Cities; and indeed nothing is more worthy
and becoming an excellent Prince, a well-disposed Common-wealth, nor more
for the interest and advantage of a Province, than to erect new Towns, where
men may cohabit with more Convenience,The Conve|nience of Co|lonies. both for Agriculture, and Defence. For besides
the Beauty and Ornament which follow'd upon that Custom, it render'd such Provinces as
were Conquer'd, more dutiful and secure to the Conquerour, planted the void places, and
made a commodious distribution of the people; upon which, living regularly and in
order, they did not only multiply faster, but were more ready to invade, and more able
for defence. But by the negligence and omission of Common-wealths and Principalites,
this method being at present disused, the Provinces are become weaker, and some of them
ruin'd. For (as I said before) it is this order alone that secures a Countrey, and supplies it
with people. The security consists in this, that in a new Conquer'd Country, a Colony
placed by Authority, is a Fortress and Guard to keep the Natives in obedience; neither
without this can a Province continue inhabited, or preserve a just distribution of the people,
because all places being not equally fertile or healthful, where it is barren, they desert;
where unwholsome, they die; and unless there be some way to invite or dispose new men to
the one, as well as the other, that Province must fail; the abandoning some places leaving
them desolate and weak, and the thronging to others making them indigent and poor. And
forasmuch as these inconveniences are not to be remedied by Nature, Art and Industry is to
be apply'd; and we see many Countreys which are naturally unhealthful, much better'd by
the multitude of Inhabitants; the Earth being purify'd by their Tillage, and the Air by
their Fires, which Nature alone would never have effected. Of this, Venice is instance
sufficient; for though seated in a sickly and watrish place, the concourse of so many people
at one time, made it healthfull enough. Pisa by reason of the malignity of the Air, was very
ill inhabited, till Genoa, and the Inhabitants upon its Rivers, being defeated and dispossess'd
by the Saracens, it follow'd, that being supplanted all of them at once, and repairing thither
in such Numbers, that Town in a short time became populous and potent. But the Custom
of sending Colonies being laid aside, new Conquests are not so easily kept, void places not so
easily supply'd, nor full and exuberant places so easily evacuated. Whereupon many places
in the world, and particularly in Italy, are become desolate and deserted in respect of what

in former ages they have been, which is imputable to nothing, but that Princes do not re|tain
their ancient appetite of true glory, nor Common-wealths the laudable Customs they
were wont.
In old time, by the virtue and courage of these Colonies, new Cities were many times
built,The Origi|nal of Florence and what were new begun inlarg'd. In which number the City of Florence may be
reckon'd, which was begun by the Inhabitans of Fiesole, and augmented by the Colonies.
It is a true Story (if Dante, and Iohn Villani may be believ'd) that the City of Fiesole, though
plac'd it self on the top of a Mountain, nevertheless, that their Markets might be better fre|quented,
and their Commodities brought to them with greater convenience to the Mer|chant,
they order'd them a place, not on the top of the hill, but in the plain, betwixt the
bottom of the Mountain, and the Rivor Arns.
These Merchants (in my judgment) were the first occasion of building in that place,
and what was originally but Store-houses for receipt of their Commodities, became after|wards
a Town, and place of Habitation.
After the Romans had Conquer'd the Carthaginians, and render'd Italy safe against For|reign
imbroilments, they multiply'd exceedingly; for men will not incommode themselves,
but where they are constrain'd by necessity; and though the terrours of War may force them
for shelter to fortify'd places and rocks, yet when the danger is over, their profit and con|venience
calls them back again to their houses, and they perfer Elbow-room, and Ease before
any such restraint. The security which follow'd in Italy upon the reputation of the Roman
Common-wealth, might possibly be the occasion that this place (from the aforesaid begin|ning
increasing so vastly) became afterwards a Town, and was call'd at first Arnina.
After this there arose Civil Wars in Rome, first betwixt Marius and Silla, then betwixt
Caesar and Pompey, and afterwards betwixt them that Murder'd Caesar, and those which
reveng'd his death. By Silla first, and after that by the three Roman Citizens (who re|venged
the Assassination of Caesar, and divided the Empire) Colonies were sent to Fiesole;
all, or Part of which setled in the plain not far from the Town which was already begun.
So that by this occasion, the place was so replenish'd with Houses, Men, and all things
necessary for Civil Government, that it might be reckon'd among the Cities of Italy. But
from whence it assum'd the name of Florence is variously conjectur'd. Some would have it
call'd Florence from Florino one of the chief of that Colonie. Some say it was not called
Florentia, but Fluentia in the beginning, in respect of its nearness to the River Arno; and
they produce Pliny as a witness, who has this Expression, That the Fluentini are near to the
Channel of the River Arnus. But that (in my opinion) is a mistake, because Pliny in his
Book design'd to tell where the Florentines were seated, not what they were call'd.The Denomi|nation of Florence. Nor is
it unlikely but that word Fluentini might be corrupted, because Frontinus and Tacitus (who
writ, and were near contemporary with Pliny) call'd the Town Florentia, and the people
Florentini, forasmuch as they were Govern'd in the time of Tiberius, according to the same
Laws and Customs with the rest of the Cities in Italy; and Cornelius Tacitus relates that
Embassadors were sent from the Florentines to the Emperour, to desire that the Waters of
the River Chiane might not be disimbogued, or diverted upon their Countrey; neither is it
reasonable to think that City could have two names at one time. My opinion therefore is
clear, that whatever might be the occasion of its Original or Denomination, it was always
call'd Florentia; that it was founded under the Empire of the Romans, and began to be
mention'd in History in the time of the first Emperours; that when that Empire was first
afflicted by the Barbarians, Totila, King of the Ostrogoti demolish'd Florence; that 250
years after, it was rebuilt by Carolus Magnus, from whose time till the year 1215. it follow'd
the fortune of the rest of Italy, and was subject to those that Commanded; during which
it was governed first by the Successors of Charles, afterwards by the Berengarii, and last of
all by the Emperours of Germany, as has been shewn in our general discourse. In those days it
was not in the power of the Florentines to extend their bounds, or to perform any memorable
action, by reason of their subjection to Forreign Dominion. Nevertheless in the year
1010. on St. Romulus day (which was a solemn Festival among the Fiesolani) they took,
and destroy'd Fiesole, either by the connivance of the Emperours, or by the opportunity of
an Interregnum betwixt the death of one Emperour and the Creation of another, at
which time all the Cities were free. But afterwards when the Popes assum'd more Autho|rity,
and the Emperours power began to diminish, all the Towns in that Province began to
comport themselves with less regard or reverence to their Princes; so that in the year 1080.
in the days of Arrigo 3. though Italy was divided betwixt him and the Church, yet till the
year 1215. the Florentines by submitting to the Conquerours, and designing no farther than
their own preservation, kept themselves quiet and intire. But as in the Body of Man, the
later they come, the more dangerous and mortal are the Diseases; so Florence the longer it

was before it fell into the paroxysms of faction, the more fatally it was afflicted afterwards
when it did. The occasion of its first division is considerable, and being mention'd by Dante
and several other Writers as remarkable, I shall take the liberty to discourse of it briefly.
Among other great and powerful Families in Florence,The first Di|vision of Flo|rence. there were the Buondelmonti, and
Uberti, and not long after them the Amidei, and Donati. In the Family of the Donati,
there was a Lady (a Widow) very rich, who had a great Beauty to her Daughter. The
Lady had resolv'd with her self to Marry her Daughter to Messr. Buondelmonte, a Young
Gentleman, the head of that Family. This intention of hers (either by negligence, or
presuming it safe enough at any time) she had not imparted to any body, so that before she
was aware Messr. Buondelmonte was to be Married to a Daughter of the House of Amidei.
The Lady much dissatisfy'd with her Omission, hoping nevertheless her Daughters Beauty
might be able to dissolve the Contract, seeing him pass one day alone towards her House,
she took her Daughter along, and went down to accost him, and opening the Gate as he
went by, she saluted him, and told him, she could not but congratulate his Marriage, though
indeed she had kept her Daughter (presenting her to him) in hopes she should have been
the Bride. The young Gentleman beholding the Excellent Beauty of the Damotselle, con|templating
her Extraction, and that her Fortune was not at all Inferiour to the persons he
had chosen, fell immediately into such a passion and desire to Marry her, that not considering
the promise he had made, the injustice he should commit, nor the ill consequences that
might follow, he reply'd, Seeing (Madam) you have preserv'd her for me (being not yet
too late) it would be ingratitude to refuse her, and without more adoe, he Married her. The
notice of his inconstancy was no sooner divulg'd, but it was taken in great indignity by the
Families of the Amidei and Uberti, who at that time were nearly ally'd. Having consulted
among themselves, and several others of their Relations, it was concluded, the affront was
insupportable, and not to be expiated but by the death of Messr. Buondelmonte; and though
some remonstrated the evils which might follow, Moscha Lamberti repli'd, That to consider
every thing, was to resolve on nothing; super-adding an old Adage, That a thing once done,
is not capable of Remedy: upon which the Fact being determin'd, the perpetration was com|mitted
to the said Moscha, Stiatta Uberti, Lambertuccio Amidei, and Oderigo Fifanti. Upon
Easter-day in the morning, they address'd themselves to the work, and being privately
convey'd to a House belonging to the Amidei, between the Old Bridge and St. Stephans,
Messr. Buondelmonte passing the River upon a White Horse, (as if an injury could as easily
have been forgotten, as a Marriage have been broken) they set upon him at the foot of the
Bridge, and slew him under a Statue of Mars, which was placed thereby. This Murder
divided the whole City, part of it siding with the Buondelmonti, and part with the Uberti;
and both the Families being powerful in Houses, Castles, and Men, the Quarrel continued
many years before either could be ejected; yet though the animosity could not be extin|guish'd
by a firm and stable peace, yet things were palliated and compos'd sometimes for
the present, by certain Truces and Cessations, by which means (according to the variety of
accidents) they were sometimes at quiet, and sometimes together by the Ears. In this Con|dition
Florence continued till the Reign of Frederick 11. who being King of Naples, and
desirous to strengthen himself against the Church; to corroborate his interest in Tuscany,
joyn'd himself to the Uberti and their party, by whose assistance the Buondelmonti were dri|ven
out of Florence, and that City (as all Italy had done before) began to divide into the
Factions of the Guelfs,The Guelfs, and Ghibilin Faction in Flo|rence. and the Ghibilins. Nor will it be amiss to commemorate how each
Family was ingag'd. The Families therefore which sided with the Guelfs were the Buon|delmonti,
Nerti, Rossi, Frescobaldi, Mozzi, Baldi, Pulchi, Gherardini, Foraboschi, Bagnesi,
Guidalotti, Sacchetti, Manieri, Lucardesi, Chiaramonti, Compiobbesi, Cavalcanti, Giandonati,
Gianfiliazzi, Scali, Guallerotti, Importuni, Bostichi, Tornaquinci, Vecchietti, Fosinghi,
Arrigucci, Agli, Silii, Adimari, Visdomini, Donati, Pazzi, della Bella, Ardinghi, Theo|baldi,
Cerchi. With the Ghibilines there joyned the Uberti, Manelli, Ubriachi, Fifanti,
Amidei, Infanganti, Malespini, Scolari, Guidi, Galli, Capprardi, Lamberti, Soldanieri,
Cipriani, Toschi, Amieri, Palermini, Migliorelli, Pigli, Barucci, Cattani, Agolanti, Brune|leschi,
Caponsachi, Elisei, Abbati, Fedaldini, Guiocchi, Galigai; to which Families of the
Nobility, many of the populacy joyn'd themselves on each side, as their interest or affe|ctions
carried them, so that in a manner the whole City was ingag'd either on one side or
the other. The Guelfs being driven out, retir'd into the Vale upon the River Arnus men|tion'd
before, and the greatest part of their Garrisons being there, they defended them as
well as they could against the Attacks of their Enemies. But when Frederick dyed, those
persons who were Neuters, retaining great interest and reputation with the people, thought
it more serviceable to the City of Florence to reconcile their differences and unite them, than
by fomenting them, to destroy it. Whereupon endeavouring a Composure, they prevail'd

at length that the Guelfs should lay aside their indignation, and return, and the Ghibilines
renounce their suspicion and receive them. Being united in this manner, it was thought
seasonable to provide for their liberty, and to contrive some Laws for their defence, before
the new Emperour should get the power into his hands.The Union  Government of the City of Florence. In order thereunto they divided
the City into six parts; They chose twelve Citizens (two for each part) which, under the
title of Antiani, they invested with the Government, but chang'd them every year. To
prevent any animosity that might arise from the determination of the matters judicial;The Antiani. they
constituted two Forreign Judges, (one of them call'd the Captain of the people, and the
other the Podesta) to decide all Civil and Criminal Causes which should occur.The Captain of the People, and Podesta. And because
Laws are but transient, and of little duration, where there is no power to defend them,
they establish'd XX Colours in the City, and 76 in the Territory, under which all the youth
was listed,Their Militia. and oblig'd to be ready in their Arms under their respective Colours, as often
and whenever the Captain, or Antiani should require them. Moreover, as their Ensigns
were distinct, so were their Arms; some of them consisted of Cross-bows, some of them of
Halbards. Their Ensigns were chang'd at every Pentecost with great solemnity, and dispos'd
to new Men, and new Captains put over their Companies. Besides, to add Majesty to
their Army, and provide a refuge for such as were wounded, or disabled in Fight, where
they might refresh, and recruit again, to make head against the Enemy, they order'd a
large Charriot cover'd with Red, and drawn by two white Oxen, upon which their Stan|dard
of White and Red was to be placed. Whenever their Army was to be drawn out,
this Charriot was to be drawn into the Market-place, and with great formality consign'd to
the Captains of the people. For the greater magnificence and ostentation of their Enter|prizes,
they had moreover,A generous Custome. a great Bell (call'd Martinello) which Rung cotinually a
month before they march'd with their Army, that the Enemy might have so much time
to provide for his Defence. So much Gallantry there was then amongst men, and with so
much Magnanimity they behav'd themselves, that whereas now adays it is reputed policy and
wisdom to surprize an Enemy, and fall upon him while he is unprovided, it was then thought
treacherous, and ignoble. This Bell, when they march'd, was carried along with the Ar|my,
and by it the Guards set, and relieved, and other Military Orders deriv'd. By this
Discipline in Civil and Martial affairs, the Florentines laid the foundation of their liberty.
Nor is it to be imagin'd what strength and authority it acquir'd in a short time, for it came
not only to be the chief City in Tuscany, but to be reckon'd among the Principal of all Italy,
and indeed there was no grandeur to which it might not have arriv'd, had it not been ob|structed
by new and frequent dissentions. Ten years together, the Florenties liv'd under
this Government; in which time they forc'd the Pistoiesi, Aretini, and Sanesi to make peace
with them, and returning with their Army from Siena, they took Volterra, demolish'd several
Castles, and brought the Inhabitants to Florence. In these Expeditions, the Guelfs had the
principal Conduct, as being much more popular than the Ghibilines, who had carried them|selves
imperiously during Frederick's Reign, and made themselves odious; or else it was be|cause
the Church party had more Friends than the Emperours, as being thought more
consistent with their liberty. The Ghibilines in the mean time, being displeased to see their
Authority so sensibly decrease, could not be satisfy'd, but attended all occasions to repossess
themselves of the Government. When Manfredi the Son of Frederick King of Naples was in|vested
in that Kingdom, and had over-power'd the power of the Church, conceiving it a
fair opportunity, they practis'd privately with him, to reassume their Government; but
they could not manage it so cunningly, but their practice was discover'd to the Antiani,
who summoning the Uberti thereupon; the Uberti not only refus'd to appear, but took
Arms, and fortify'd themselves in their houses; at which the people being incens'd, took
Arms likewise,Manfredi. King of Naples, a great Patron of the Ghibili|nes. and joyning with the Guelfs, drove them out of Florence, and forc'd the
whole Ghibiline party to transplant to Siena. From thence they desir'd the assistance of
Manfredi King of Naples, who sending them supplies, by the Conduct and Diligence of
Frinata (of the House of Uberti) the Guelfs received such a blow upon the River Arebia,
that those which escaped (supposing their City lost) fled directly to Lucca, and left Florence
to shift for it self. Manfredi had given the Command of the auxiliaries which he sent to
the Ghibilines, to the Conte Giordano, a Captain of no small reputation in those times. Gior|dano,
after this Victory advanced with his Ghibilines to Florence, reduc'd the City to the
obedience of Manfredi; depos'd the Magistrates, and alter'd or abrogated all the Laws, and
Customs that might give them the least figure or commemoration of their liberty: Which
injury being done with little discretion, was receiv'd by the people with so much detestation,
that whereas before they were scarce Enemies to the Ghibilines, they became thereby inve|terate
and implacable; and that mortal animosity was in time their utter destruction.
Being to return to Naples upon affairs of great importance to that Kindom, the Conte

Giordano left Comte Guido Novello (Lord of Casentino) in Florence, as Deputy for the
King. This Guido Novello call'd a council of Ghibilines at Empoli, wherein it was unani|mously
concluded, that Florence should be razed, being (by reason the people were so rigid
Guelfs) the only City capable to reinforce the declining party of the Church.
Upon so cruel and barbarous a Sentence against so Noble a City,Ferinata U|berti. there was not one Friend
or Citizen oppos'd, besides Ferinata delli Uberti; who publickly and couragiously undertook
its defence: Declaring, That he had not run so many dangers, not expos'd himself to so
many difficulties, but to live quietly afterwards in his own Countrey; nor would he now
reject what he contended for so long, nor refuse that which his good fortune had given him;
he was resolv'd rather to oppose himself (against whoever should design otherwise) with as
much Vigour and zeal as he had done against the Guelfs; and if jealousie and apprehension
should prompt them to endeavour the destruction of their Countrey, they might attempt if
they pleas'd; but he hop'd, with the same Virtue which drove out the Guelfs, he should be
able to defend the City. This Ferinata was a man of great Courage, excellent Conduct,
Head of the Ghibilines, and in no small esteem with Manfredi himself. These qualifications,
and the consideration of his Authority, put an end to that resolution, and they began now
to take new measures, and contrive wayes of preserving the State. The Guelfs who had
fled to Lucca, being dismiss'd by the Lucchesi, upon the Counts commination, they with|drew
to Bologna, from whence being invited by the Guelfs of Parma, to go against the Ghi|bilines,Carlo d' An|io call'd into Italy by the Pope.
they behav'd themselves so well, that by their Valour, the Adversary was overcome,
and their possessions given to them: So that increasing in Honour and Wealth, and under|standing
that Pope Clement had call'd Carlo d' Angio into Italy, to depose Manfredi (if
possibly) They sent Embassadours to his Holiness to tender their assistance; which the Pope
not only accepted, but sent them his own Standard, which the Guelfs carry'd ever after in
their Wars, and is us'd in Florence to this very day. After this, Manfredi was beaten, di|spoyl'd
of his Kingdom, and Slain, and the Guelfs of Florence having performed their share
in that Action, their party grew more brisk and couragious; and the Ghibilines more
timorous and weak. Whereupon those who with Count Guido Novello were at the helm in
Florence, began to cast about how they might, by benefits, or otherwise, gain and cajole the
people, whom before they had exasperated by all circumstances of injury: But those reme|dies
(which if us'd in time, before necessity requir'd, might possibly have prevail'd) being
apply'd abruptly, and too late, did not only not contribute to their safty, but hasten'd
their ruine. To coaks and insinuate with the people and their party, they thought it would
do much if they restor'd them to a part of that Honour and Authority which they had lost.
To this purpose they chose XXXVI. Citizens from among the People, and adding to them
two Forreign Gentlemen from Bologna, they gave them power to reform the State of the
City as they pleas'd. As soon as they met, the first thing they pitcht upon, was to divide
the City into several Arts (or Trades) over each Art they plac'd a Master,A new Model in Florence. who was to
administer Justice to all under his Ward; and to every Art a Banner was assign'd, that un|der
that, each Company might appear in Arms, when ever the safty of the City requir'd it.
At first these Arts, (or Companies) were twelve, seven greater, and five less; the lesser in|creasing
afterwards to fourteen, their whole number advanc'd to XXI, as it remains at this
day. The Reformation proceeding quietly in this manner, and contriving many things for
the common benefit of the people, without interruption; Count Guido thinking himself
under an equal Obligation to provide for his Soldiers; caus'd a Tax to be laid upon the
Citizens, to raise Money for their pay; but he found such difficulty in the business, he durst
never collect it: Whereupon, perceiving all lost, unless something was suddainly done; he
combin'd with the chief of the Ghibilines, and determin'd to take that back again by force
from the people which so unadvisedly they had given.
With which design, having assembled the several Companies in their Arms, (and the
XXXVI. Reformatori with them) causing a suddain Alarm to be brought in, the Reformatori
being frighted, and retiring to their Houses, the Ensigns of the several faculties were
display'd, and several Armed men behind them immediately; understanding that Count
Guido and his party were at St. Iohns, they made a stand at St. Trinita, and chose Giovanni
Soldanieri for their Captain.New Commo|tion. The Count on the other side, hearing where they had posted,
advanced against them; and the people, not declining, they met in a place which is now
call'd Loggia dei Tornaquinci, where the Count was worsted, and most of his party slain.
Being off of his mettle, and fearful the Enemy would assault him in the night, and cut his
Throat; his Men being cow'd, and unable to defend him, without considering other re|medy,
he resolv'd to preserve himself by flying, rather than by fighting; and accordingly
(contrary to the perswasion of the Heads of the Ghibilines) he retired to Prato with what
men he had left. When he found himself safe, and his fear over, he became sensible of

his Errour, and being desirous to have repair'd it next morning, at break of day he drew
out his Men, march'd back to Florence, designing to recover that Honourably, which he
had so Scandalously lost; but he found himself mistaken, for though it might have cost the
people hot water to have expell'd him, they found it no hard matter to keep him out when
he was gone; insomuch that being repuls'd, he drew off with great sorrow and shame to
Casentino, and the Ghibilines return'd to their Houses. The people being Conquerours, out
of affection to all such as had a love for their Countrey, they resolv'd to reunite the City
once more, and call'd home all their Citizens which were abroad, as well Ghibilines as Guelfs.
Hereupon the Guelfs return'd, after six years banishment, the Ghibilines late attempt was
pardoned, and they receiv'd back again; but yet they continued odious both to the people,
and Guelfs, the last not being able to extinguish the memory of their banishment; nor the
first to forget their Tyranny and insolence, when the Government was in their hand; so
that their animosity was deposited neither on the one side, nor the other.
Whil'st the affairs of Florence were in this posture, a report was spread, that Corradine,
Nephew to Manfredi, was coming with Forces out of Germany, to Conquer the Kingdom
of Naples; upon which the Ghibilines conceiv'd fresh hopes of recovering their Authority:
and the Guelfs being no less solicitous for their security, begg'd the assistance of King
Charles, in case Corradine should come. Charles having comply'd, and his Forces upon
their March, the Guelfs became so insolent, and the Ghibilines so timorous, that two days
before the French Army arriv'd, the Ghibilines fled out of the City, without staying to be
expell'd. The Ghibilines departed, the Florentines new Modell'd their City, choosing
Twelve principal Magistrates to continue in Authority only for two Months, not under
the title of Antiani,A second Mo|del by the Guelfs. but Ruoni-huomini. Next to them they constituted a Councel of 80
Citizens, which they call'd La Credenza: after which, 180 were chosen out of the people,
which with the Credenza, and the 12 Buoni-huomini were call'd the General-Councel:
besides which,The 12 Buo|ni Huomini. La Credenza. they erected another Councel, consisting of 120. both Citiziens and Nobles,
which Councel was to consummate and ratifie whatever was debated or resolv'd in the rest.
Having setled their Government in this manner, and by new Laws, and Election of Magi|strates
of their own party, fortifi'd themselves against the Machinations of the Ghibilines,
the Guelfs confiscated the Ghibilines Estates, and having divided them into three parts, one
was assign'd to publike uses, another given to their Magistrates and Captains, and the third
distributed among the Guelfs, to recompense the damage they had receiv'd. The Pope to
preserve Tuscany to the Faction of the Guelfs, made King Charles Imperial Vicar of that
Province. By this method, the Florentines having maintain'd their honour and reputation
abroad by their Arms, and at home by their Laws, they remain'd firm and secure; in the
mean time the Pope dyed,Gregory X. and after a two years vacancy, and a tedious dispute, Gregory X.
was elected, who being at the time of his Election (and a long while before) in Syria, and
(by consequence) ignorant of the humours of the Factions, he carry'd not himself with that
caution towards them, as his Predecessors had done. But in his way to France, being
arriv'd at Florence, he thought it the Office of a good Pastor to endeavour to compose their
differences, and prevail'd with them to receive Commissioners from the Ghibilines to nego|tiate
the manner of their return; but though their Peace was made, and all particulars
concluded,Florence un|der Excommu|nication. the Ghibilines were too jealous to accept them, and refus'd to come back. The
Pope imputed the fault to the City, and excommunicated it in his passion, under which
censure it continued whil'st he lived; but after his death, when Innocent V. was created, it
was taken off.Innocent 5. Innocent V. was succeeded by Nicholas III. of the house of the Orsini; and
because the Popes were alwayes jealous of any great power in Italy (though rais'd by the
favour of the Church) and constantly endeavour'd to depress it;The Jealousie of the Popes. great troubles, and frequent
variations ensued;Nicolas 3. for the fear of a Person grown Potent to any degree, was the advance|ment
of another less powerful than he; who growing powerful by his preferment, as his
Predecessor had done, became formidable like him; and that fear was the occasion of his
debasement. This was the cause that Kingdom was taken from Manfredi, and given to
Charles. This was the reason that Charles became terrible afterwards, and his ruine was
conspir'd: for Nicholas III. (mov'd by the considerations aforesaid) prevail'd so, that
Charles by the Emperours means, was remov'd from the Government of Tuscany, and
Latino (the Popes Legat) sent thither in his place, by Commission from the Emperour.
Florence at this time was in no very good condition, for the Guelfish Nobility being grown
insolent, and careless of the Magistrates, several Murders and other violences were daily
committed, the Malefactors passing unpunish'd by the favour and protection of the Nobles.
To restrain these insolencies, it was thought good by the Heads of the City, to recall those
who were banished,The Ghibi|lines return. which gave opportunity to the Legate to reunite the City; and to the
Ghibilines, to return: whereupon instead of XII. Governours which they had before, they

were increas'd to XIV. (VII. of each party) their Government to be Annual, and their
Election by the Pope.Martinus Pope. Two years Florence remain'd under this Form, till Martino (a
Frenchman) was created Pope, who restor'd to King Charles whatever Authority Pope
Nicholas had taken from him: So that Florence being again in Commotion; the Citizens
took up Arms against the Emperours Governour, and to restrain the Gbibilines, and correct
the insolence of their Nobility, put the City under a new form of Government. It was in
the year 1282.The Govern|ment reformed by the Citizens. when the Corporation of the Arts having been invested with the Magistracy
and Militia, had gain'd great reputation; whereupon by their own Authority they order'd
that instead of the XIV. Three Citizens should be created (with the Title of Priori) who
should Govern the Common-wealth for two Months,The three Priori to go|xern two Months, to be chosen out of the City indif|ferently. and be chosen indifferently out of
Commons or Nobility, provided they were Merchants, or professed any Art. Afterwards
the chief Magistracy was reduc'd to Six persons (one for each Ward) where it continued to
the year 1342. in which the City was reduc'd into Quarters, and the Priori, to Nine, they
having been advanc'd to 12. by some accident in the mean time. This Constitution was
the occasion (as shall be shew'd in its place) of the Nobilities ruine, who upon sundry pro|vocations
were excluded, and afterwards without any respect, oppress'd by the people. At
first the Nobility consented to its Erection, as an expedient to unite, and accommodate all
differences; but afterwards incroaching, and interfering for the Government, all of them
lost it. There was likewise a Palace assign'd for the constant Residence of this Councel, (in
which the Magistrates were formerly accustom'd to confer with the Commissioners of the
Church) and Serjeants, and other necessary Officers, for their greater honour, appointed
to attend: Which Councel, though at first it had only the Title of Priori; yet afterwards
for Magnificence sake, it had the addition of Segnori.
For a while the Florentines continued quiet within themselves, though they had Wars
abroad with the Aretines (whohad driven out the Guelfs) with whom they ingag'd success|fully
in Compaldino,The Segnori. and overcame them. Upon which, the City increasing both in Wealth,
and number of Inhabitants, it was thought good to inlarge their Walls, which they did to
its present Circumference; whereas before its Diameter was only from the Old Bridge to
S. Lorenzo. The Wars abroad, and Peace at home, had almost exterminated both the
Ghibilines, and Guelfs in that City; there remain'd only those sparks of animosity (which
are unavoidable in all Cities) betwixt the Nobles and the People; for the one solicitous of
their freedom according to their Laws,Discord be|twixt the No|bility and peo|ple. and the other impatient to Command them, it is
not possible they should agree. Whil'st they were apprehensive of the Ghibilines, this hu|mour
did not show it self in the Nobility; but when the Ghibilines were low and depress'd,
it began to exert, and the people were injur'd daily, beyond the Vindication either of
the Magistrates, or Laws; every Nobleman making good his insolence, by the multitude
of his Friends and Relations, both against the Priori, and the Captain. The Heads there|fore
of the Arts (by way of remedy against so great inconvenience) provided that in the
beginning of its Office,The Priori The Gonfa|loniere. every Councel of the Priori should create an Ensign, or Gonfaloniere
di justicia, out of the people, assigning him 1000 men in 20 Companies, which were to be
ready with their Arms, and their Gonfaloniere to see Justice administer'd whenever the Court,
or their Captain requir'd them. The first in this Office, was Ubaldo Ruffoli, who drawing
out his Bands, demolish'd the Houses of the Galetti, because one of that Family had slain
one of his Fellow-Citizens in France. The establishment of this Order by the Arts was
not difficult, by reason of the jealousies and emulations amongst the Nobility, who were
not in the least sensible it was intended against them, till they felt the smart of it, when
'twas put in Execution. This Constitution was terrible to them at first, but afterwards they
return'd to their old insolence again; for having insinuated themselves into the Councel of
the Priori, they found means to hinder the Gonfaloniere from executing his Office. Besides,
Witness being always required upon any accsation, the Plaintiff could hardly find any
body that would give Testimony against the Nobility. So that in a short time Florence was
involved in its own distraction, and the people exposed to their former oppression, Justice
being grown dilatory and tedious, and Sentence, though given, seldom or never executed.
The Populace not knowing what resolution to take in this Case, Giano della Bella (a person
of Noble extraction, but a Lover of the Liberty of the City) incourag'd the Heads of the
Arts, to reform the City, and by his persusion it was Ordain'd that the Gonfaloniere should
reside with the Priori, and have 4000 men under his Command; they likewise excluded
the Nobility out of the Councel of the Segnori.
They made a Law that all Accessaries, or Abettors, should be liable to the same punish|ment
with those who were actually Guilty; and decreed that Common report should be
sufficient to convict them. By these Laws (which were called Ordinamenti della Giustitia)
the people gain'd great reputation: but Giano della Bella, being look'd upon as the contriver

of their Destruction, became odious to the Nobility; and not to them only, but to the
wealthiest of the Populace, who began to suspect his Authority, and not without reason, as
appear'd afterwards upon the first occasion was given him to abuse it. It happened one of
the Commons was killed in a fray, where several of the Nobility were present; Corso
Donati being one amongst the rest, the Murder was laid to his Charge, as the most furicus
and desperate. He was taken into Custody by the Captain, but (however causes went)
whether he was innocent of the Crime, or the Captain fearful to condemn him, he was
presently discharg'd. The people offended at his discharge, betook themselves to their
Arms, ran to the House of Giano della Bella, and beg'd of him, that he would be the means
that the Laws he had invented might be put in Execution. Giano had privately a desire
that Corso should be punish'd, and therefore advis'd not the people to lay down their Arms,
(as many coceived he ought) but incouraged them to address to the Segnori with their
Complaints, and desire their Vindication. The people full of rage, thinking themselves
abused by the Captain, and abandon'd by Giano, went not to the Segnori (as directed) but
away they ran to the Captain's Palace, and plunder'd it; which action displeased the whole
City, and was laid upon Giano, by such as meditated his ruine; whereupon some of his
Enemies happening afterwards to be of the Segnori, he was accused to the Captain as an
Incendiary and Debaucher of the people.
Whil'st his Cause was in agitation, the people took Arms again, flocked in great num|bers
to his House, and offer'd to defend him against the Segnori his Enemies. Giano had
no mind to experiment the popular favour, or trust his life in the hands of the Magistrates,
as fearing the Malignity of the one, no less than the unconstancy of the other; but to se|cure
himself against the malice of his Enemies, and his Countrey against the commotion of
his Friends, he resolved to give way to their Envy, and Banish himself from that City
which he had preserv'd from the Tyranny of the Nobility by his own danger and charge.
The Nobility, after his departure, to recover their dignity, which they conceived lost by
the dissentions among them, united, and apply'd themselves by two of their Number, to the
Senate or Segnoria (which they judg'd to be their friends) to intreat them to mitigate in
some measure the acerbity of those Laws which were made against them: which demand
was no sooner known, but the people (fearing the Signoria should comply) began
immediately to tumultuate, and, betwixt the ambition of the one, and suspicion of the
other, they fell soon after to blows. The Nobility stood upon their Guards in three places,
at St. Iohn's, in the Mercato nuovo, and the Piazza de Mozzi, under three Commanders,
Forese Adinari, Vanni de Mozzi, and Geri Spini. The people were not got together under
their Ensigns in great Numbers at the Senator's Palace, which at that time not far from
St. Pruocolo; and because the people were jealous of the Signori, they deputed six Citizens
to share with them in the Government. In the mean time, while both parties were prepa|ring
for the Combat, some both of the Nobility and Commons,Perswasion to the Nobility to be quiet. with certain Religious
persons of good Reputation, interpos'd themselves, remonstrating to the Nobility, that the
Honour they had lost, and the Laws made against them, were occasioned by their arrogance
and ill Government; that now to take Arms, and betake themselves to force, for the
recovery of what was lost by their own dissention and ill-management, would be the ruine
of their Countrey, and a detriment to themselves. That they should consider in number,
riches, and malice, they were much inferiour to the people. That that Nobility they so
vainly affected, by which they thought to advance others, when they came to sight would
prove but a meer Title and Name, unable to defend them against the advantages which
their Enemies had over them. To the people it was represented imprudence to drive things
too far,The  to the people. and make their Adversaries desperate; For he that hopes no good, fears no ill. That
it ought to be considered, their Nobility were they which had gain'd so much Honour to
their City in its Wars, and were not therefore in justice to be used at that rate. That they
could be content to have the Supream Magistacy taken from them, and endure it patiently;
but they thought it unreasonable, and insupportable to be at every bodies mercy (as their new
Laws rendered them) and subject to be driven out of their Countrey upon every Cappriccio.
That it would be well to mitigate their fury, and lay down their Arms, rather than to run
the hazard of a Battel, by presumption upon their Numbers, which had many times fail'd,
and been worsted by the less. The people were divided in their Judgments, some were for
ingaging, as a thing some time or other would necessarily be; and better now, than to deser
till their Enemies were more powrful: and if it could be imagined the mitigation of the
Laws would content them, they should be mitigated accordingly; but their insolence and
pride could never be laid by, till by force they were constrain'd to't. To others more mo|derate
and prudent, it appeared that the alteration of the Laws would not signifie much, but
to come to a Battel might be of very great importance; and their Opinion prevailing, it was

provided that no accusation should be admitted against a Nobleman without necessary testi|mony.
Though upon these terms both parties laid down their Arms, yet their jealousies of
one another were mutually retain'd, and they began again to fortifie on both sides. The
People thought sit to re-order the Government,New reforma|tion in Florence 1298. and reduc'd their Signori to a less number,
as suspecting some of them to be too great favouers of the Nobility, of whom the Mansini,
Magalotti, Altoviti, Peruzzi, and Cerretani were the chief. Having setled the State in this
manner in the year 1298. for the greater Magnificence and Security of their Signori, they
founded their Palace, and made a Piazza before it, where the houses of the Uberti stood for|merly:
About the same time also the Foundation of the Prisons were laid, which in few
years after were finished. Never was this City in greater splendor, nor more happy in its
condition than then, abounding both in men, riches, and reputation. They had 3000.
Citizens in the Town it to bear Arms, and 70000. more in their Territory. All Tuscany
was at its devotion, partly as subjects, and partly as friends. And though there were still
piques and suspicions betwixt the Nobility and the People, yet they did not break out into
any ill effect, but all lived quietly and peaceably together; and had not this tranquillity been
at length interrupted by dissention within, it had been in no danger from abroad; being in
such terms at that time, it neither feared the Empire, nor its Exiles, and could have brought
a force into the Field equivalent to all the rest of the States in Italy. But that diseas from
which ab extra it was secure, was ingendred in its own bowels. There were two Families
in Florence, the Cerchi, and the Donati, equally considerable, both in numbers, riches, and
dignity; being Neighbours both in City and Countrey, there happened some exceptions and
disgust betwixt them, but not so great as to bring them to blows, and perhaps they would
never have produc'd any considerable effects, had not their ill humours been agitated and
fermented by new occasion. Among the chief Families in Pistoia, there was the Family of
the Cancellieri. It happened that Lore the Son of Gulielmo, and Geri the Son of Bertaccio,
fell out by accident at play, and passing from words to blows, Geri received a slight wound.
Gulielmo was much troubled at the business,The diffe|ren ein the fa|mily of the Can|cellieri, the oc|casion and consequence. and thinking by excess of humility to take off
the scandal, he increased it and made it worse. He commanded his Son to go to Geri's Fa|thers
house, and demand his pardon; Lore obey'd, and went as his Father directed: but that
act of humanity did not at all sweeten the acerbity of Bertaccio's mind, who causing Lore to
be seiz'd by his servants (to aggravate the indignity) he caused him to be led by them into
the stable, and his hand cut off upon the Manger, with instruction to return to his Father,
and to let him know, That wounds are not cured so properly by words, as amputation. Guli|elmo
was so enraged at the cruely of the fact, as he and his friends immediately took Arms
to revenge it; and Bertaccio and his friends doing as much to defend themselves, the whole
City of Pistoia was engaged in the quarrel, and divided into two parties. These Cancellieri
being both of them descended from one of the Cancellieri who had two Wives, one of them
called Bianca: that party which descended from her,The Biachi and Ner called it self Bianca; and the other in
opposition was called Nera. In a short time many conflicts happened betwixt them, many
men killed, and many houses destroyed. Not being able to accommodate among themselves,
though both sides were weary, they concluded to come to Florence, hoping some expedient
would be found out there, or else to fortifie their parties by the acquisition of new friends.
The Neri having had familiarity with the Donati, were espoused by Corso, the head of that
Family. The Bianchi, to support themselves against the accession of the Donati, fell in with
Veri the chief of the Cerchi, a man not inferiour to Corso in any quality whatever. The ma|lignity
of this humour being brought hither from Pistoia, began to revive the old quarrel be|twixt
the Cerchi and Donati in such manner, that the Priori, and other Principal Citizens be|gan
to apprehend they should fall together by the ears, and the whole City come to be divi|ded.
Hereupon they applyed themselves to the Pope, desiring he would interpose his Au|thority
to asswage those differences which were too great for their private power to compose.
The Pope sent for Veri, and prest him earnestly to a reconciliation with the Donati. Veri
seemed to be surprised at his importunity, pretended he had no prejudice to them at all, and
because reconciliation presupposed a quarrel, there being nothing of the latter, he thought
there was no necessity of the first. So that Veri returning from Rome without any other
conclusion, the Malevolence increas'd, and every little accident (as it happened afterwards)
was sufficient to put all in confusion. In the Moneth of May, several Holidays being pub|lickly
celebrated in Florence, certain young Gentlemen of the Donati, with their friends on
Horseback, having stopt near St. Trinity, to see certain Women that were Dancing, it fell out
that some of the Cerchi arrived there likewise with some of their friends, and being desirous
to see as well as the rest, not knowing the Donati were before, they spurr'd on their horses, and
justled in among them. The Donati looking upon it as an affront, drew their Swords; the
Cerchi were as ready to answer them, and after several cuts and slashes given and received,

both sides retir'd. This accident was the occasion of great mischief; the whole City (as
well People as Nobility) divided, and took part with the Bianchi and Neri, as their in|clinations
directed them. The chief of the Bianchi were the Cerchi, to whom the Adi|mari,
the Abbati, part of the fosinghi, the Bardi, Rossi, Frescobaldi, Norli, Mannilli, all
the Mozzi, the Scali, Gerrardin, Cavalcanti, Matespini, Bestichi, Giandionati, Vecchietti,
and Arriguelzi, joyn'd themselves; with these sided several of the populace and all the
Ghibiline faction in Florence; so that in respect of their Numbers, they seem'd to have
the whole Government of the City. The Donati on the other side were heads of the Neri,
and follow'd by all the rest of the before mentioned Nobility, who were not ingag'd with
the Bianchi; and beside them all the Parzi, Bisdonini, Manieri, Bagnsit, Tornaquinci,
Spini, Buondelmonti, Gianfigliazzi, and Brunelteschi; Nor did this humour extend it self
only in the City, but infected the whole Countrey. In so much that the Captains of the
Arts and such as favour'd the Guelfs, and were Lovers of the Commonwealth, very
much apprehended least this new distraction should prove the ruine of the City, and the
restauration of the Ghibilins. Whereupon they sent to the Pope, beseeching him to think
of some remedy, unless he had a mind that City (which had been always a bulwark to
the Church) should be destroy'd or become subject to the Ghibilins. To gratifie their
request, the Pope dispatch'd Matteo d' Aquasparta (a Portugal Cardinal) as his Legate
to Florence, who sinding the party of the Bianchi obstinate and untractable, as presuming
upon the advantage of their Numbers, he left Florence in an anger, and interdicted
them; so that the Town remained in more confusion a his departure, than he found it.
All parties being at that time very high, and dispos'd to mischief, it happen'd that several
of the Cerchi and Donati meeting at a Burial, some words pass'd betwixt them, and
from words they proceeded to blows, but no great hurt done, for that time. Both sides
being returned to their houses, the Cerchi began to deliberate how they might fall upon
the Donati, and in Conclusion they went in great numbers to attack them, but by the
Courage of Corso they were repell'd, and several of them Wounded. Hereupon the
City fell to their Arms; the Laws and the Magistrates were too weak to contest with the
fury of both parties. The wisest and best Citizens were in perpetual fear. The Donati
and their friends having less force, were more anxious and solicitous of their safety, to pro|vide
for it as well as was possible: At a meeting of Corso with the heads of the Neri, and the
Captain of the Arts, it was concluded that the Pope should be desired to send them some
person of the Blood Royal to reform their City, supposing that way the most probable to
suppress this Bianchi. The Assembly, and their resolution was notify'd to the Priori, and
aggravated against the Adverse party as a Conspiracy against their Freedom. Both facti|ons
being in Arms, Dante, and the rest of the Signori taking Courage, with great Wis|dome
and prudence causing the people to put themselves in Arms, by Conjunction of se|veral
out of the Countrey they forc'd the heads of both parties to lay down their Arms, con|fin'd
Corso, Donati and several of the faction of the Neri to their houses; and that their
proceedings might seem impartial, they committed several of the Bianchi, who afterwards
upon plausible pretences were dismiss'd. Corso and his accomplices were discharg'd like|wise;
and supposing his Holiness to be their friend, took a journey to Rome to perswade
him personally to what by Letters they had begg'd of him before. There happen'd to be
at the Popes Court at that time Charles de Valois the King of France his brother, call'd
into Italy by the King of Naples to pass over into Sicily. The Pope (upon the impor|tunity
of the Florentine Exiles) though sit to send him to Florence to remain there till
the season of the year serv'd better for his transportation.Charles of Valos made Governor of Florence. Charles arrived, and though
the Bianchi (who had then the Supremacy) were jealous of him, yet being Patron of
the Guelfs, and deputed thither by the Pope, they durst not oppose his coming; but on
the Contrary, to oblige, him they gave him full Authority to dispose of the City as he plea|sed.
Charles was no sooner invested with his Authority; but he caus'd all his friends and
Partizans to Arm, which gave the people so great a jealousie that he would Usurp upon
their Liberties, that they also put themselves in Arms, and stood ready every man at his
door to resist any such attempt. The Cerchi and the chief of the Bianchi (having had the
Government in their hands and managed it proudly) were become generally odious,
which gave incouragement to Corso and the rest of the Neri who were banish'd, to re|turn
to Florence, being assur'd that Charles, and the Captains of the companies were
their friends. Whilst their suspicion of Charles had put the City in Arms, Corso, his
Comrades, and many of their followers enter'd into Florence without any impediment:
And although Veri de Cerchi was perswaded to oppose, he refus'd it, and told them, he
would leave their Chastisement to the people of Florence, against whose interest Corso did
come. But he was mistaken in his Measures, for in stead of being punished, he was re|ceived

very kindly by the people; and Veri was forc'd to fly for his safety. For Corso ha|ving
forc'd his entrance at the Porta Pinti, drew up and made a stand at S. Pietro Mag|giori
(a place not far from his Palace) and having united with such of the people, and his
friends as desir'd Novelty, and were come thither on purpose; the first thing he did was
to discharge all Prisoners whatever and however committed, whether by private or pub|lick
Authority. He forc'd the Signori to return privately to their houses, and elected a
certain Number (of the faction of the Neri) out of the people, to supply their places. For
five days together they ransack'd and plunder'd the houses of the chief of the Bianchi. The
Cerchi and the heads of that faction, seeing the people for the most part their Enemies,
and Charles none of their friend, were retir'd out of the City, to such Castles as they
had, and whereas before they would not entertain the Counsel of the Pope, they were now
glad to implore his assistance, and to let him understand that Charles was not come to
the advantage, but to the prejudice of the City. Whereupon the Pope sent his Legate
Matteo di Aquasparta to Florence the second time, who not only made a peace betwixt the
Cerchi and Donati, but fortified it by several marriages and alliances. Nevertheless in|sisting
to have the Bianchi participate of the Chief Offices, and being deny'd by the Neri
who had them in possession, he left the City as ill satisfi'd as before, and again Excom|municated
it for its disobedience. Thus both parties continued discontented. The Neri,
seeing their Enemies so near, were apprehensive least by their destruction they should re|cover
the Honours and Authority which they had lost; and as if these Fears and Animo|sities
had been not sufficient to do mischief, new affronts and injuries were offered. Ni|cholas
de Cerchi, being going with some of his friends to some of his houses, as he pass'd
by the Ponte ad Africo, was assaulted by Simon son of Corso Donati. The Conflict was
sharp, and on either side deplorable, for Nicholas was kill'd upon the place, and Simon
so wounded that he died the next Morning. This accident disturb'd the whole City afresh,
and though the Neri were indeed most Culpable, yet they were protected by the Govern|ment,
and before judgment could be obtain'd, a Conspiracy was discover'd between the
Bianchi and Piero Terranti (one of Charles his Barons) with whom they practis'd pri|vately
to be restor'd to the Government. The Plot was detected by several letters from
the Cerchi to the said Piero, though some imagin'd they were counterfeited by the Donati,
to divert the infamy they had incurr'd by the assassination of Nicholas. The Cerchi and
all their Clann were at this time Prisoners to the Donati (and among the rest Dante the
Poet) their Estates were Consiscated, and their houses demolish'd. Their party, with
several of the Ghibilines that had joyn'd themselves with them, were dispers'd up and
down in sundry places, attending new troubles to better their Condition; and Charles
having finish'd what he design'd when he came thither, return'd to the Pope in pursuance
of his Expedition into Sicily, in which he managed himself with no more prudence than
he had done in Florence; but losing many of his men, he went back into France, with no
little dishonour. After Charles was departed, for some time Florence was quiet, only Corso
was dissatisfied, as not thinking himself in Authority suitable to his deserts: for the Go|vernment
being in the hands of the people,New troubles occasioned by Corso Donati. he believed it managed by such as were much
his inferiours. Moved therefore by these provocations, to varnish over a foul design with a
fair pretence, he calumniated several Citizens who had had charge of the Publick money,
for imbeziling of it, and applying it to their private use; giving out that it was fit they
should be inquir'd after, and punished: several of his mind did the same, and many others
by their ignorance and Credulity were persuaded that what Corso did was out of pure care
and affection to his Country. On the other side the persons accus'd, having the favour of
the people, stood upon their justification, and so far these differences proceeded, that after
several expostulations, and civil controversies, they came at length to take Arms. On one
side there were Corso, Lotieri Bishop of Florence, with many of the Nobility, and some of
the Commons. On the other side there were the Signori, and the greatest part of the
people: so that there was sighting in many places of the City. The Signori, perceiving
their affairs in some danger, sent to Lucca for aid, and immediately all the people in
Lucca came in to their assistance; by whose supervention things were presently compos'd,
the tumults asswag'd, and the people continued in their former Liberty and Government,
without any other punishment of the Author of the scandal. The Pope had heard of the
tumults at Florence, and sent thither Nicholas da Prato his Legate to appease them, who,
for his quality, learning and behaviour, being a man of great reputation, he quickly ob|tained
such credit with the people, that they gave him Authority to reform, or Model
their Government as he pleas'd. Being of the Ghibiline faction, he was inclin'd to call
home those of that party who were banish'd; But first he thought it convenient to in|gratiate
with the people, by restroing their Ancient Companies, which Act added as much

strength to their interest, as it took away from the Nobless. When he had, as he thought,
sufficiently oblig'd the multitude, The Legate design'd to call home the Exiles, and try'd
many ways to effect it, but was so far from succeeding in any of them, that he
render'd himself suspected to the Governors, was forc'd out of the City, and leaving all
in confusion, in a great passion he Excommunicated it at his departure. Nor was this
City molested with one humour only, but several; there being at one the factions be|twixt
the Nobility and the people, the Guelfs and the Ghibilines, the Bianchi, and the
Neri, At that time all the City was in Arms, and many bickerings happend'd. Many
were discontented at the Legates departure, being willing the banish'd Citizens should re|turn.The Medici and Giugni.
The Chief of them who rais'd the report were the Medici and the Giugni, who
(with the Legate) were discover'd to be favourers of the Rebels; in the interim Skir|mishes
and Rencounters pass'd in several places of the Town, and to add to their Calamity,
a fire broke out in the Orto S. Michel among the houses of the Abbati, from thence i
went to the houses of the Caponsacchi, and burn'd them, from thence to the houses of
the Macci, Amieri, Toschi, Cipriani, Lamberti, Cavalcanti, and all the New Market; from
thence it pass'd to the Porta S. Maria, burn'd that, and then wheeling about to the Old
Bridge, it consum'd the Palaces of the Gherardini, Pulci, Amidei, Lucardesi, and with
them so many other houses, that the number of all that were consum'd by that fire
amounted to more than thirteen hundred. Some were of opinion it began by accident in
the height of the Conflict. Others affirm it was done on purpose by Neri Abbati, Prior of
S. Piero Scharagio (a dissolute and mischievous person) who seeing every body ingaged,
thought he might commit a piece of wickedness then, which no body should be able to
remedy; and to the end it might succeed the better, and give less suspicion of him, he set the
houses of his own party on fire, where he could do it with convenience. These Conflicts,
and this Conflagration happen'd in Iuly 1304.Florence burned, 1304. at which time Corso Donati was the
only person who did not arm in those tumults; and not without reason, for thereby he
presumed (when weary of their fighting they should incline to an agreement) he should
more easily be chosen Umpire betwixt them; at length all Arms indeed were layd down, but
more that they were tyr'd, and weary of their miseries, than from any relentment or conde|scension
on either side. The whole consequence of all was, that the Rebels were not suffer'd
to return, and the party which favour'd them was forc'd to comply. The Legate being
come back to Rome, and understanding the new distractions in Florence, persuaded the
Pope, that if he design'd to compose them, it would be necessary to send for twelve of the
Principal Malecontents of that City, which being the nourishment and fomentors of
their miseries, their miseries would cease as soon as they were remov'd. The Pope took
his Counsel, sent for twelve of the Chief Citizens (who came to Rome in obedience to his
summons) and among them Corso Donati was one. Upon the departure of these Citizens
the Legate signifi'd to the Exiles, that now was their time (the City being destitute of their
heads) to return. Whereupon the Citizens which were banish'd, getting what force toge|ther
they were able, they march'd to Florence, enter'd where the walls were unfinish'd, and
pass'd on as far as the Piazza of S. Iohn. It was a remarkable passage to consider,
that those people who fought in their behalf whilst humbly and unarm'd they begged
to be admitted, seeing them come forcibly into the City with their weapons in their
hands, turn'd against them immediately, and joyning with the people, beat them out of the
City. This Enterprize was lost by leaving part of their forces at Lastra, and not attend|ing
the arrival of Tolosetto Uberti who was coming from Pistoia with three hundred
horse; but supposing Expedition of greater importance to their success, than Strength, they
found (as many had done before) That delay takes away the opportunity, and celerity the
force. The Rebels epuls'd, Florence return'd to its old divisions. To lessen the Au|thority
of the Cavalcanti, the people assaulted and took from them the Castle of Stinche
in the Val di Greve, which had belong'd anciently to that family; and because those who
were taken in this Castle were the first which were put in the new built Prisons,
that building took its name from the Castle from whence they came, was call'd
le Stinche from thence, and is call'd so to this day. After this, those who had the Go|vernment
in their hands re-establish'd the Companies of the people; gave them the En|signs
which had been us'd at first under the discipline of the Arts. The Captains, the
Gonfalonieri of the Companies, and the Colledge of the Signori were call'd, and Orders
were given that they should assist the Signoria or Senate at all times, in time of Com|motion
or injury, with their Swords, and in time of peace with their Counsels. To the
two old Governours they added another call'd Essecutore, whose Office it was by conjun|ction,
with the Gonfalonieri to restrain and correct the insolence of the Grandees. In the
mean time the Pope dying, Corso and his fellow Citizens return'd from Rome, and

might have liv'd quietly, had not the insatiableness of Corso's ambition created new
troubles. To gain reputation it was always his Custom to oppose the sentiment of the
Nobility in whatever was propos'd; and which way he observed the people to encline,
thither he constantly directed his Authority, to work himself into their favour; so that
in all Innovations and Controversies he was the Head; all persons resorting to him who
had any thing extraordinary in design. Hereupon he became so odious to several con|siderable
Citizens, that the faction of the Neri subdivided, and fell into open division
among themselves, because Corso made use of private Force and Authority, and of such
Persons as were enemies to the State.Corso Donati. Yet such was the Awe and Majesty of his Person,
that every body fear'd him; to deprive him of the peoples favour (which, that way, was ea|sily
disingaged) it was given out that he design'd upon the Government, and meant to make
himself King: Which from his extravagant way of living was credible enough, and much
confirm'd when afterwards he married a daughter of Uguccione della Faggivola chief of the
Rianchi, and Ghibilius, and the most powerfull Person in the City. This Alliance was no
sooner known among his Enemies, but his adversaries took Arms, and the people for that
reason were so far from appearing in his defence, that the greater part of them joyn'd with
his Enemies. The Cheif of his Enemies (and who were at the head of them) were Rosso della
Tosa, Pazzino de Pazzo, Geri Spini, and Berto Brunelleschi. They, their followers and the
greatest part of the people, ran with their Swords drawn to the foot of the Palace of the Sig|nori,
by whose Order an accusation was prefer'd to Plero Bianca Captain of the people, against
Corso, as a person who (by the assistance of Uguccione) conspired to be King. Upon this im|peachment
he was summon'd, and refusing to appear, was declared a Rebel for his Contuma|cy;
there having been but two hours time betwixt the accusation and sentence: judgment
pronounc'd,Condemned. the Signori, with the several Companies of the people (their banners display'd)
went presently to apprehend him. Corso on the other side not at all dismay'd either at the se|verity
of the sentence, the authority of the Signori, nor the unconstancy of his friends (who
had many of them forsaken him) fell to fortifying his house, hoping to have defended him|self
there till Uguccione (to whom he had sent word of his condition) should come to his
rescue. His houses, and Avenues were fortifi'd and barricado'd by him, and strengthen'd
with such Garrisons of his friends, that though the people were very numerous and press'd
hard to have enter'd them, they could not prevail. The Conflict was smart, many kill'd and
wounded on both sides, and the people finding there was no entrance that way by force,
got into the houses of his Neighbours, and through them they brake unexpectedly into
his. Corso finding himself inviron'd by his Enemies, and no hopes of relief from Ugncci|one,
dispairing of Victory, he resolv'd to try what was possible for his Escape; advancing
therefore with Gherardo Bondini and several other his most faithful and valiant friends, he
charg'd so furiously upon his Enemies, that he brake them, and made his way thorow them
(fighting) out of the Pta della Croce: Nevertheless being pursu'd, Gherardo was slain by
Boccaccio Cavicciulli upon the Africa, and Corso was taken Prisoner at Rouezano by certain
Spanish horsmen belonging to the Signoria. But, disdaining the sight of his Victorious Ene|mies,
and to prevent the torments which they would probably inflict, as they were bringing
him back towards Florence, he threw himself off his horse, and was cut to pieces by one of
the Company; his body was gather'd together by the Monks of S. Salvi, and bury'd, but
without any solemnity.His death. This was the sad end of that Magnanimous Person, to whom his
Country, and the Neri, ow'd much both of their good fortune and ill; and doubtless had his
mind been more Moderate, his memory would have been more honourable; however he de|serves
a place among the best Citizens this City did ever produce, though indeed the turbu|lency
of his Spirit caus'd his Country and party both to forget their obligations to him,
and at length procur'd his death, and many mischiefs to them. Uguccione coming
to the relief of his Son in Law as far as Remoli, and hearing he was taken by the
people, presuming he could do him no good, to save his own stake, he return'd back as
he came.
Corso being dead in the year 1308.1308. all tumults ceas'd, and every body liv'd quietly till
news was brought that Arrigo the Emperor was come into Italy with all the Florentin Exiles
in his Company, whom he had promis'd to reinstate on their own Country. To obviate this,
and lessen the number of their Enemies, the Magistrates thought fit of themselves to reinvite
all those who had been rebels, but some few which were particularly excepted. Those which
were excepted, were the greatest part of the Ghibilines, and some of the faction of the Bian|chi,
among which were Dante Aleghieri, the Sons of Veri de Cerchi, and Giano della Bella.
They sent likewise to desire the assistance of Robert King of Naples, but not prevailing in
an amicable way without terms, they gave him the Government of their City for five
years, upon condition he would defend them as his subjects. The Emperour in his passage

came to Pisa, and from thence coasting along the shore, he went to Rome, where he was
Crown'd in the year 1312; after which, addressing himself to the subduction of the
Florentines, he marcht by the way of Perugia and Arezzo to Florence, and posted
himself with his Army at the Monastery of St. Salvi, where he continued fifty days without
any considerable exploit. Despairing of success against that City, he remov'd to Pisa, con|federated
with the King of Sicily to make an Enterprize upon Naples, and marched forward
with his Army; but whilst he thought himself sure of Victory, and Robert gave himself
for lost, the Emperour died at Buonconvento, and that Expedition miscarri'd. Not long
after it fell out that Uguccione became Lord of Pisa, and by degrees of Lucca, where he
joyn'd himself with the Ghibilines, and by the assistance of that faction, committed great
depredations upon the Neighbours. The Florentines to free themselves from his Excursi|ons,
desir'd King Robert that his Brother Piero might have the Command of their Army.
In the mean time Uguccione was not idle. To increase his numbers, and extend his domi|nion,
partly by force, and partly by stratagem, he had possess'd himself of many strong Ca|stles
in the Vallies of Arno, and Nievole, and having advanc'd so far as to besiege Monte
Catini, the Florentines thought it necessary to Relieve it, left otherwise that Conflagra|tion
should consume their whole Country. Having drawn together a great Army, they
March'd into the Val di Nievole, gave battel to Uguccione, and after a sharp sight, were de|feated.
In the battel, they lost 2000. men besides Piero the Kings Brother, whose body could
never be found. Nor was the Victory on Uguccione's side without some qualification, he ha|ving
lost one of his Sons, and several Officers of Note. After this disaster, the Florentines
fortifi'd at home as much as they could, and King Robert sent them a new General call'd
the Conte di Andrea with the title of Conte Novello. By his deportment (or rather by the
Genius of the Florentines, whose property it is to increase upon every settlement, and to fall
afterwards into factions upon every accident) notwithstanding their present War with Uguc|cione,New divisi|ons.
they divided again, and some were for King Robert, and others against him. The
chief of his Adversaries were Simon della Tosa, the Magalotti, and other popular familes,
who had greatest interest in the Government. These persons sent first to France, and
then into Germany, to raise men, and invite Officers, that by their assistance they might
be able to rid themselves of their new Governour the Conte. But their fortune was ad|verse,
and neither could be procur'd. Nevertheless they gave not their Enterprize over,
though they had been disappointed both in Germany and France; they found out an
Officer in Agobbio; having driven out King Roberts Governour, they sent for Lando
from Agobbio, and made him Essecutore, (or indeed Executioner) giving him ab|solute
power over their whole City.Laudo de A|gobbio. Laudo being naturally cruel and avaritious,
march'd with arm'd men up and down the City, plundering this place, and killing in
that, as those who sent for him gave him directions; and not content with this inso|lence,
he Coyn'd false money with the Florentine stamp, and no man had the power to
oppose it; to such grandeur was he arriv'd by the dissention of the Citizens. Miserable
certainly, and much to be lamented was the Condition of this City, which, neither the
Consequences of their former divisions, their apprehension of Uguccione, nor the Au|thority
of a King was sufficient to unite. Abroad they were infested by Uguccione; at
home they were pillag'd by Laudo; and yet no reconciliation. The Kings friends,
many of the Nobility, several, great men of the Populace, and all the Guelfs, were
Enemies to Laudo and his party. Nevertheless, the Adversary having the Authority in
his hand, they could not without manifest danger discover themselves; however, that
they might not be deficient in what they were able to do towards the freeing themselves
of so dishonourable a Tyranny, they writ privately to King Robert, to intreat that he
would make Conte Guido da Buttifolle his Lieutenant in Florence. The King granted
their request, sent the Conte to them forthwith, and the adverse party (though the
Signori also were Enemies to the King) had not the Courage to oppose him. But the
Conte for all that, had not much Authority confer'd, because the Signori, and Gonfalo|nieri
of the Companies were favourers of Laudo and his accomplices. During these trou|bles
in Florence, the daughter of Alberto coming out of Germany, pass'd by the City in her
way to her husband Charles Son to King Robert. She was very honourably received by
such as were friends to the King, who complaining to her of the sad Condition of their City,
and the Tyranny of Laudo and his party, she promis'd her assistance, and by the help
of her interposition, and such as were sent thither from the King, the Citizens were re|concil'd,
Laudo depos'd from his Authority, and sent home to Agobbio full of treasure
and blood. Laudo being gone, they fell to Reform, and the Signoria was confirm'd by
the King for three years longer; and because before there were VII in the Senate of
Laudo's party, VI new were chosen of the Kings, and they continu'd XIII. for sometime;

but they were reduced afterwards to VII their old number. About this time Ugucciene
was driven out of Lucca, and Pisa, and Castruccio Castracani, a Citizen of Lucca, suc|ceeded
him in the Government; and being a brave and Couragious young Gentleman,
and Fortunate in all his Undertakings,Castruccio Castracani. in a short time he made himself Chief of the
Ghibilin faction in Tuscany. For this cause, laying aside their private discords, the Flo|rentines
for several years made it their business, first to obstruct the growth of Castruc|cio's
Power, and afterwards, (in case he should grow powerful against their will) to
consider which way they were to defend themselves against him: and that the Signori
might deliberate with more Counsel, and Execute with more Authority, they Created
XII. Citizens (which they call'd Buonhuomini) without whose advice and concurrence the
Signori were not to do any thing of importance. In the mean time the Authority of King
Robert expir'd; the Government devolv'd once more upon the City, which set up the old
Rectori and Magistrates as formerly, and their fear of Castruccio kept them Friends, and
united. Castruccio after many brave things performed against the Lord's of Lunigiana, sat
down before Prato: The Florentines alarm'd at the news, resolv'd to relieve it, and shut|ting
up their Shops, they got together in a confus'd and tumultuous manner about 20000
Foot and 1500 Horse; and to lessen the force of Castruccio and add to their own, Procla|mation
was made by the Signori, that what ever Rebel of the Guelfs should come in to
the relief of Prato, should be restor'd afterwards to his Country: upon which Procla|mation
more than 4000 of the Guelfs came in and joyned with them, by which accession,
their Army being become formidable, they march'd with all speed towards Prato, but
Castruccio, having no mind to hazard a Battail against to considerable a force, drew off and
retreated to Lucca. Upon his retreat, great Controversie arose in the Army betwixt the
Nobility and the people. The people would have pursued, and fought in hopes to have
overcome and destroyed him; the Nobility would return, alledging they had done e|nough
already in exposing Florence for the relief of Prato. That there being a necessity
for that, it was well enough done, but now, no necessity being upon them, little to be
gotten, and much to be lost, fortune was not to be tempted, nor the Enemy to be follow'd.
Not being able to accord among themselves, the business was referred to the Signori, which
consisting of Nobility and Commons, they fell into the same difference of opinion, which
being known to the City, they assembled in great multitudes in the Piazza, threatning
the Nobility highly, till at last they condescended. But their resolution coming too late,
and many constrain'd to joyn in it against their persuasions, the Enemy had time, and
drew safely off to Lucca. This difference put the people into such a huff against the
Nobility, the Signori refus'd to perform the Promise they made to the Rebels which
came in upon Proclamation, which the Rebels perceiving, they resolv'd to be before hand,
if possible, and accordingly presented themselves at the Gates of the City to be admitted
before the Army came up; but their design being suspected, miscarryed, and they were
beaten back by those who were left in the Town: To try if they could obtain that by trea|ty,
which they could not compass by force, they sent eight Embassadors to the Signori, to
commemorate to them the Faith they had given; the dangers they had run thereupon;
and that it could not be unreasonable they should have their promised reward. The Nobi|lity
thought themselves obliged, having promis'd them particularly as well as the Signori, and
therefore imploy'd all their interest for the advantage of the Rebels; but the Commons (be|ing
inrag'd that the Enterprize against Castruccio was not prosecuted as it might have been)
would not consent; which turn'd afterwards to the great shame and dishonour of the City.
The Nobility being many of them disgusted thereat, endeavoured that by force, which
was denyed them upon applications; and agreed with the Guelfs, that if they would
attempt their entrance without, they would take up Arms in their assistance within; but
their Plot being discover'd the Day before it was to be Executed, when the banish'd Guelfs
came to make their attack, they found the City in Arms, and all things so well dispos'd
to repell them without and suppress those within, that none of them durst venture, and so
the Enterprize was given over without any effort. The Rebels being departed, it was
thought fit those Persons should be punish'd who invited them thither; nevertheless though
every Body could point at the delinquents, yet no Body durst Name them, much more ac|cuse
them. That the truth might impartially be known, it was ordered that the Names
of the Offendors should be written down; and deliver'd privately to the Captain;
which being done, the Persons accused were Amerigo Donati, Teghiaio Frescobaldi, and Lo|teringo
Gherardini, whose Judges being now more favourable than (perhaps) their crime de|serv'd,
they were only condemn'd to pay a Sum of Money, and came off.
The tumults in Florence upon the alarm by the Rebels, demonstrated clearly that to
the Company of the People one Captain was not sufficient; and therefore it was ordered for

the future, that every Company should have three or four, and every Gonfalonier two or
three join'd to them, which should be call'd Pennonieri, that, in case of necessity, where the
whole Company could not be drawn out, part of it might appear under one of the said
Officers. And as it happens in all Common-wealths, after any great accident, some or o|ther
of the old Laws are abrogated, and others reviv'd to supply them, so the Signoria
being at first but occasional and temporary, the Senators and Collegi then in being (having
the power in their hands) took Authority upon themselves to make a Council of the Sig|nori,
which should sit forty Months for the future,The Coun|cil of the Sig|nori to it for|ty Months, whereas before it was occasi|onal. their Names being to be put into a
purse, and drawn out every two Months. But for as much as many of the Citizens were
jealous their Names were not in the purse, there was a new Imborsation before the forty
Months began. Hence it was, the custom of the purse had its Original, and was us'd in the
Creation of their Magistrats, both at home and abroad, whereas formerly they were cho|sen
by a Council of the Successors, as the term of the Office began to expire. At first this
way of election was call'd Imborsationi, and afterwards Squittini. And because every three,
or at most five years, this custom was to be us'd,Election of Magistrats by Imborsation it was thought they had prevented great
mischiefs to the City, occasion'd by multitude of Competitors, and tumults at every e|lection
of Magistrats, which tumults being to be corrected no way (in their Judgments)
so readily, they pitched upon this, not discerning the evils which they conceal'd under so
small a convenience. It was now in the year 1325. when Castruccio having seiz'd on
Pistoia, was grown so considerable, that the Florentines (jealous of his greatness) resolv'd
before he had setled his new conquest, to fall upon him, and recover it (if possible) out
of his hands. Whereupon of Citizens and their Friends they assembled 20000 Foot, and
3000 Horse, and encamp'd before Alto Pascio, by taking it, to render the relief of Pistoia
the more difficult. The Florentines took that pass, and when they had done, they march'd
towards Lucca, forraging and wasting the Countrey. But by the Imprudence and Treache|ry
of their Commander, little progress was made. This Person (call'd Ramondo da Car|dona)
observing the Florentines to have been very liberal of their liberty, and to have
confer'd the Government sometimes upon Kings, sometimes upon Legats, and sometimes
upon more inferiour Persons; he thought with himself, that if he could bring them into any
exigence, or distress, it might easily fall out that they would make him their Prince; to this
purpose he frequently desir'd and press'd to have the same Authority invested in him in
the City, as he had in the Army, otherwise he could not require nor expect that Obe|dience
which was necessary for a General. The Florentines not hearing on that Ear, their
Captain proceeded but slowly,Ramondo da Cardona Gene|ral of the Flo|rentines. neglecting his time, as much as Castruccio improv'd it; for
Castruccio having procur'd supplies from the Visconti, and other Princes of Lombardy, and
made himself strong, Ramondo (who before lost his opportunity of conquering for want of
fidelity) now lost the possibility of preserving himself, for want of discretion; for march|ing
up and down lazily with his Army, he was overtaken by Castruccio near Alto Pascio,
assaulted, and after a long fight, broken to pieces; in which Action many Florentines were
taken Prisoners and Kill'd, and their General among the rest, who receiv'd the reward of
his infidelity and ill Counsel from Fortune her self, which had been more properly bestow'd
by the hands of the Florentines. The calamities which Castruccio introduced upon the Floren|tines
after his Victory; the Depradations, Imprisonments, Ruin's, and Burnings, are not
to be express'd; having no Body to oppose him, for several Months together, he went
where, and did what he had a mind to, and the Florentines thought themselves happy, (af|ter
such a defeat) if they could save the City. Nevertheless they were not so desperatly
low, but they made great provisions of Money, rais'd what Soldiers was possible, and sent to
their Friends for assistance; but no providence was sufficient against such an Enemy: they
were forc'd therefore to make choice of Carlo Duke of Calabria (the Son of King Robert)
to be their Soveraign; If it would please him to undertake their defence; for that Family
having been us'd to the Supremacy of that City, they promis'd him rather their Obedience,
than Friendship. But Carlo being personally imploy'd in the Wars of Sicily, he sent Gual|tieri
(a French Man and) Duke of Athens,The Duke of Athens Gover|nor of Florence. to take possession in his behalf. He as his Masters
Leiutenant, took possession of the Government, and created Magistrats as he plea'sd. Not|withstanding
his behaviour was so modest, and in a manner so contrary to his own Nature,
every one lov'd him. Having finish'd his War in Sicily, Charles came with a thousand
Horse to Florence, and made his entry in Iuly 1326. His arrival gave some impediment
to Castruccio,  kept him from rummaging up and down the Country with that freedom and
security which he had formerly done. But what the City gain'd abroad, it lost at home,
and when their Enemies were restrain'd, they became expos'd to the insolence and oppressi|on
of their Friends: for the Signori acting nothing without the consent of the Duke, in a
years time he drain'd the City of four hundred thousand Florins, though in the Articles of

agreement it was expresly provided he should not exceed 200000. So great were the Impo|sitions
which he, or his Father laid upon the Town; and yet as if these were too few, their
miseries were increas'd by an accumulation of new jealousies, and new Enemies. For the
Ghibilines of Lombardy were so fearful of Carlos advance into Tuscany, that Galiazzo Vis|conti,
and the rest of the princes of Lombardy, with Money and fair Promises persuaded
Lewis of Bavaria,Lod the Em|perour called into Italy. (who had been Elected Emperour against the Popes will) to pass into
Italy with an Army. Being arriv'd in Lombardy, he pass'd forward into Tuscany, made
himself Master of Pisa by the assistance of Castruccio, and having receiv'd a considerable
supply of Money there, he march'd on towards Rome: Whereupon Charles (being fear|ful
of his Kingdom) and leaving Philippo da Saginitto his Lieutenant in Florence, went
Home with the Force he brought with him. Upon his departure, Castruccio seiz'd upon
Pisa, and the Florentines got Pistoia by stratagem: Castruccio march'd immediatly to reco|ver
it, sat down before it, and manag'd his business with so much Conduct and resolution,
that though the Florentines made many attempts to relieve it, both by Insults upon his
Army, and incursions into his Country, their Attacks, and their diligences were all in|effectual,
they could not possibly remove him; for so firmly was he resolv'd to chastise
the Pistoians, and weaken the Florentines, that the Pistoians were constrain'd to surrender,
and receive him once more for their Lord; by which Action as he contracted much Ho|nour
and Renown,The Death of Castruccio and the Duke of Calabria. so he thereby contracted so much Sickness and Infirmity, that he di|ed
shortly after upon his return to Lucca. And, because one ill or good accident goes sel|dome
alone; Charles Duke of Calabria and Lord of Florence died at Naples much about
the same time; so that in a very small space the Florentines were freed from the oppression
of the one, and the apprehension of the other. They were no sooner free, but they fell
to reforming,New refor|mation. null'd all the Laws and Ordinances of the ancient Councils, and created
two new, one of them consisting of three hundred of the Commons, the other of two hun|dred
both Commons and Gentlemen; the first was call'd the Council of the People, and the
second the Common Council.
The Emperour being arriv'd at Rome, he created an Anti-Pope; decreed many things to
the prejudice of the Church; and attempted more, which he was not able to carry; so that
at length he removed (with no little disgrace) from Rome to Pisa, where, either dis|daining
his Conduct, or for want of their Pay, eight hundred German Horse mutiny'd,
fortifi'd themselves at Monte Ariaro, and as he was departed from Pisa towards Lombardy,
posses'd themselves of Lucca, and drave out Francisco Castracani, whom the Emperour had
left Governour of the Town. Being Masters of that City, and their intentions to make
what profit of it they could, they offered it to the Florentines for twenty thousand Florins, but
by the advice of Simon della Tosa it was refus'd; this resolution would have been much to
the advantage of our City, had the Florentines persever'd; but changing it afterwards, it prov'd
much to their detriment; for refusing it at that time when they might have had it so cheap,
they bad much more for it afterwards, and were denied it; which was the occasion that
Florence chang'd its Government often, to its great inconvenience. Lucca, being re|fus'd
in this manner by the Florentines, was purchased for 30000 Florins by Gherardino
Spinoli a Genovese, and (because People are more slow and indifferent in accepting what
is offer'd, than in conceiving what is not) as soon as it was known to be bought by Ghe|rardini,
and at how cheap a rate, the Florentines were much troubled they had it not
themselves, and blam'd all those who had any way discouraged them. To buy it being
too late, they sought to gain it by force, and to that end sent their Army to over-run and
spoil the Country about it. About this time the Emperour was return'd out of Ita|ly,
and the Pope, by Order of the Pisani, sent Prisoner into France. The Florentines up|on
the Death of Castruccio (which follow'd in the year 1328) till the year 1340 conti|nued
quiet at Home;The Floren|tines quiet at Home. Intent only upon their Wars abroad. In Lombardy upon the coming
of Iohn King of Bohemia, and in Tuscany upon the account of Lucca; they adorn'd their
City likewise with many new Buildings, and particularly the Tower of St. Reparata accord|ing
to the directions of Giolto the most Famous Painter in his time.Their Build|ings. Moreover, upon an
inundation of the River Arnus in the year 1333 (in which the Water swelling twelve fa|thoms
high in some places of Florence carried away several Bridges, and many Houses were
ruin'd) they repair'd all, with great care and expence. But in the year 1340 this tran|quillity
was disturb'd, and they had new occasion of alteration. The Grandees of the Ci|ty
had two ways to maintain, and increase their Authority. One was by ordering the Im|borsations
so, as the Magistracy should fall always either to them or their Friends. The o|ther
was by making themselves chief in the Elections of the Rettori, and thereby obliging
them to be favourable to them afterwards in all their determinations. And of this second
way they were so fond and conceited, that not content with two Rettori (as they had for|formerly).

A while after they set up a third; with the Title of the Captain of the Guards,
in which Office they plac'd Iacomo Gabrieli d' Agobbio,A Captain of the Guards. with absolute Power over the Citi|zens.
Iacomo in the sight of the Government, committed daily many Injuries, but more
especially to Piero de Baldi, and Bardo Frescobaldi. Being Nobly descended, and by con|sequence
proud, they could not endure, to have a stranger do them wrong, in defiance of
their other Magistrates. To revenge themselves of him; and the Government, they enter'd
into a Conspiracy with several Noble, and Popular Families in the City, who were disgusted
with their Tyranny. The manner concluded upon was, that every one should get as ma|ny
Arm'd Men into his House as he could, and that on All-Saints Day in the Morning, when
all the People were at Mass, they should take Arms, kill the Captain, and the chief of
their Governours, and afterwards make new Magistrates, and new Laws for the State. But
because dangerous enterprizes, the more considered, are always the less willingly under|taken;
it happens that Plots which allow too much time for their Execution, are gene|rally
discover'd: There being among the Conspirators a Gentleman call'd Andrea di Bar|di,
whose fear of Punishment prevailing upon him, beyond his desire of Revenge, he be|tray'd
all to Iacomo Alberti, his Kinsman, Iacomo imparted it immediatly to the Priori,
and the Priori to the Governors. And because the design was so near Execution, All-Saints
day being at hand, many of the Citizens assembled in the Palace, and judging it unsafe to
defer, they would needs persuade the Signori to cause the great Bell to be rung, and the
People commanded to their Arms. Taldo Valori was at that time Gonfaloniere, and Fran|cisco
Salviati one of the Signori. Being Relations of the Bardi they dissuaded the sounding
of the Bell, alledging it was not secure to Arm the People upon trivial Occasions, because
Authority given to them, without some power reserv'd to restrain them, was never known
to produce any good, and that it was much easier to raise a Tumult, than to suppress it.
They judg'd it better therefore to inquire farther into the verity of the thing, and punish it
rather Civilly (if it appear'd to be true) than in a furious and tumultuous manner to cor|rected
it, perhaps with the destruction of the whole City. But these Arguments serv'd not
the turn, but with Vilanous language, and Insolent behaviour the Signori were constrain'd
to cause the Bell to be rung, upon which the People immediately took Arms, and away to
the Piazza. The Bardi, and Frescobaldi perceiving they were discover'd, and resolving to o|vercome
with Honour or die without Shame, betook themselves to their Arms, hoping
they would be able to defend that part of the City beyond the Bridge where their Houses
were; whereupon they broke down the Bridges, and fortifi'd themselves, till they should
be reliev'd by the Nobility of the Country, and other Persons their Friends. But that de|sign
was frustrated by the People which lived among them in the same part of the City, who
took up Arms for the Signori; finding themselves entermixt, and that design not like to
succeed, they abandon'd the Bridges, and retreated to the Street where the Bardi dwelt, as
stronger than the rest, where they made a most valient defence. Iacomo d' Agobbio knew
well enough that all this Conspiracy was against him; and having no great inclination to
be kill'd, in a terrible fright, with his hair standing right up, he ran to the Palace of the
Signori, and secur'd himself among the thickest of the Arm'd Men. The other of the Ret|tori,Maffeo da Muradi.
though not so conscious, were much more couragious, especially the Podesta call'd Maffeo
da Maradi, who presenting himself where they were fighting, and passing the Bridge Ru|baconte,
threw himself undauntedly among the Swords of the Bardi, and made a sign for a
Parly. Upon which, out of reverence to his Person, his Courage and good qualities, they
let fall their Arms, and stood quietly to attend him. In a modest and grave harangue he
blam'd their proceedings; remonstrated the danger they were in, if they did not yield to
the indignation of the People; he gave them hopes likewise of a fair hearing, and a merci|ful
sentence, and promis'd his intercession for them; then returning to their Signori he per|suaded
that they would not use extremities, and conquer with the loss of so many Citi|zens
lives; nor condemn without hearing. In short, so far he obtain'd, that by consent of
the Signori, Baldi, Frescobaldi and their Friends left the City, and retir'd to their Castles
without any Impediment. They being gone, and the People disarm'd, the Signori pro|ceeded
only against such of the Families of the Baldi and Frescobaldi as had taken Arms,
and to lessen their Power, they bought the Castles of Mangona, and Vernia of the Bardi, and
made a Law that no Citizen should for the future possess any Castle within twenty miles
of Florence. Not many months after Stialta Frescobaldi, and several others of that Fami|ly
were beheaded, having been proclaim'd Rebels before. But it was not sufficient for
these Governours to have conquer'd and suppress'd the Baldi and Frescobaldi; like other
People (whose insolence for the most part increases with their Power) they grew impe|rious
as they grew strong. Whereas, before the Florentines had only one Captain of the
Guards to afflict them, they chose another now for the Country, investing him with great

Authority, that those Persons whom they suspected, might not be suffered to live quietly
either within the City o without and besides this they abus'd and provok'd the Nobility
in such manner, that they were ready to Sacrifice, and ell both themselves and City to be
revng'd, and watching for an occasion, they met one, and improv'd it. By the many
troubles in Lombardy, and Tuscany, Lucca was fallen under the Dominion of Mastino del|la
Seala Lord of Verona, who ingaged to deliver it up to the Florentines, but did not per|form;
for being Lord of Parma he thought himself able to keep it, and valued not the
breach of his Faith. The Florentines, in revenge, joyn'd with the Venetians, and made
such war upon him, he had well igh lost most of his territory; but the Florentines got
little by it, more than the satisfaction to have distress'd Mastino: for the Venetian (accord|ing
to the practice of all States when enter'd into League with People less powerful than
themselves  having taken Trevigi, and Vicenza; ade a peace without any regard to the
Florentines. A while after, the Visconti Lords of Milan, having taken Parma from Ma|stino,
conceiving himself unable to keep Lucca any longer, he resolv'd to sell it. The Flo|rentines
and the Psan were competitors in the purchase, and whilst the bargain was dri|ving,
the Pisan perceiving th Florentnes like to carry it, in respect that they were the
more wealthy of the two;Lucca sold to the Floren|tines. they betook themselves to force, and joyning with the Visconti,
they sat down before it. The Florentines not at all discourag'd, proceeded in their bar|gain,
and having concluded their terms, they paid down part of the Money to Mastino,
and giving Hostages for the rest, the Town was to be deliver'd, whereupon Naddo Ruc|cellat,
Giovanni di Bernardino de Medii, and Rosso d Riccirdo de Ricci, were sent to take
possession, who passing by force into Lucc, they were receiv'd by Mastino, and the Town
deliver'd up into their hands. However, the Pisan continued their siege, and endea|vour'd
by all possible industry to gain it by force. The Florentines on the other side were
as solicitous to relieve it, but after  long War, with great dishonor, and the loss of their
Money,Taken from them by the Pisans. they were driven out of it, and the Town became subject to the Pisans. The loss
of this City (as in such cases doth frequently happen) put the People of Florence into a
Mutiny against their Governors, so that in all places they upbraided the conduct and ad|ministration
of their Superiors. At the beginning of the War the management of the Mili|tary
affairs was committed to XX. Citizens, who made Maletesta di Rimini their General,
who having executed his Command with little courage, and less discretion, they apply'd
themselves to Robert King of Naples for assistance. In complyance with their request, King
Robert sent them supplies under the Command of Gualtieri Duke of Athens,The Duke of Athens. who (the Hea|vens
ordaining that all things should concur to their future misery) arriv'd at Florence at
the very time when the Enterprize of Lucca was tterly lost. The XX Governors of the
Militia, seeing the People inrag'd, thought by choosing a new General, either to inspire
them with new hopes, or take away the occasion of their obloquy; and because their fears
were still upon them, that the Duke of Athens might defend them the better, they first
made him Conservator, and afterwards General. The Nobility, upon the reasons above
said, being highly discontented, and many of them retaining a correspondence with
Gualtieri ever since he was Goveor of Florence in the behalf of Charles Duke of Cala|bria,
they began to think now was their tim to wreck their malice, and to ruine the Ci|ty,
believing there was no way left them to subdue the People who had insulted so long,
but by subjecting them to a Prince, who knowing the Generosity of the Nobless, and the
insolence of the Commons, might recompense both according to their deserts; besides they
presum'd it would be something meritorious, if upon their motion, and by their coopera|tion
he acquir'd the Government. In pursuane of this design, they had many private meet|ings,
in which they prest him to take the Government wholly into his hands, and they
would assist him to the utmost. Nor were the Nobility alone in this business, some of
the Popular families (as the Peruzzi, Acciaivoli, Antellesi, and Buonaccorsi) joyn'd them|selves
with them; for being much in debt, and unable out of their own Estates to clear
themselves, they Plotted against other Peoples, and to free themselves of their Creditors,
made no scruple of enslaving their Country. These persuasions exasperated the Ambiti|on
of the Duke, who, to gain the reputation among the people of being just and exact, per|secuted
those who had the management of the Wars against Lucca, caus'd Giovan de Me|dici,
Naddo Ruccellai, and Gulielmo Altoviti to be put to death, banish'd several others,
and others he fined. These executions startled the middle sort of the Citizens, only the
Grandees, and the Common People were satisfi'd; the last out of their natural pleasure
in mischief, the first to see themselves so handsomly reven'gd for the insolencies they had
receiv'd from the People. Whereupon, when ever the Duke appear'd in the streets, he
was pursued with acclamations, and applauses of his integrity, every one exhorting him
to go on in finding out, and punishing the fraud of their Neighbours. The Authority

of the XX. was much lessen'd, the Dukes reputation increas'd, and a general fear of him
overspread the whole City; so that to show their affections towards him, all People caus'd
his Arms to be painted upon their Houses, and nothing but the bare title was wanting to
make him a Prince. Being now in a condition (as he thought) of attempting any thing
securely, he caus'd it to be signifi'd to the Senate, that for the good of the Publick he judg'd
it necessary they should transfer their Authority upon him, and that (seeing the whole
City approv'd it) he desir'd he might have their resignation. The Signori, having long
foreseen the ruine of their Country approaching, were much troubled at the message: They
were sensible of the danger they were in, yet not to be deficient in any Act of duty to their
Country, they refus'd him couragiously. As a pretence and specimen of his Religion, and
humility, the Duke had taken up his quarters in the Monastery of St. Croce, and being desi|rous
to give the finishing stroke to his wicked designs, he by Proclamation requir'd all the
People to appear before him the next morning in the Piazza belonging to that Monastery.
This Proclamation alarmed the Signori more than his message, whereupon joyning them|selves
with such as were lovers both of their liberty and Country, upon consideration of
the Power of the Duke, and that their force was insufficient, it was resolv'd they should
address themselves to him in an humble and supplicatory way, to try if by their Payers
they might prevail with him to give his Enterprize over, or else to execute it with more
moderation. All things being concluded, part of the Signori were sent to attend him, and
one of them accosted him in this manner.The Speech of one of the Senators to the Duke of Athens My Lord, we are come hither, mov'd first by
your Proposal, and next by your Proclamation for assembling the People, presuming
your resolution is to obtain that by force, to which upon private application we have not
consented: it is not our design to oppose force against force, but rather to remonstrate
the burden and heaviness of that load you would take upon your self, and the dangers
which will probably occur. And this we do, that you may hereafter remember, and di|stinguish
betwixt ours, and the Counsel of such as advise the contrary, not so much out
of respect and deference to your advantage, as for the venting their own private fury and
revenge. Your endeavour is to bring this City into servitude, (which has always liv'd free)
because the Government has been formerly given by us to the Kings of Naples, whereas
that was rather an association, than a subjection. Have you consider'd how important
and dear the Name of Liberty is to us? A thing, no force can extirpate, no time can ex|tinguish,
nor no merit preponderate. Think, Sir, I beseech you, what Power will be ne|cessary
to keep such a City in subjection. All the strangers you can entertain will not be
sufficient; those which are Inhabitants you cannot prudently trust; for though at pre|sent
they are Friends, and have push'd you forward upon this resolution, yet, as soon as
they have glutted themselves upon their Enemies, their next Plot will be to expel you,
and make themselves Princes. The People, in whom your greatest confidence is placed,
will turn, upon every slight accident, against you, so that in a short time you will run a
hazzard of having the whole City your Enemies, which will infallibly be the ruine both
of it and your self; because those Princes only can be secure, whose Enemies are but few,
and they easily remov'd either by banishment or death; but against universal hatred there
is no security, because the spring and fountain is not known, and he that fears every Man,
can be safe against no Man. If yet you persist, and take all possible care to perserve your
self, you do but encumber your self with more danger, by exciting their hatred, and making
them more intent and serious in their revenge. That time is not able to eradicate our de|sire
of Liberty, is most certain. We could mention many good Cities in which it has
been reassum'd by those who never tasted the sweetness of it, yet upon the bare character and
tradition of their Fathers, they have not only valu'd, but fought and contended to re|cover
it, and maintain'd it afterwards against all difficulties and dangers. Nay, should
their Fathers have neglected, or forgot to recommend it, the publick Palaces, the Courts
for the Magistrats, the Ensigns of their freedom (which are of necessity to be known by
all Citizens) would certainly proclaim it. What action of yours can counterpoize a|gainst
the sweetness of Liberty? For what can you do to expunge the desire of it out of
the Hearts of the People? Nothing at all, no, though you should add all Tuscany to this
State, and return every day into this City with new victory over your Enemies. The
Honor would be yours, not ours; and the Citizens have gain'd fellow-servants rather
than subjects. Nor is it the power of your deportment to establish you. Let your
Life be never so exact, your conversation affable, your judgments just, your liberality ne|ver
so conspicuous, all will not do, all will not gain you the affections of the People; if
you think otherwise, you deceive your self, for to People that have liv'd free, every link
is a load, and every bond a burthen. And to find a state violently acquir'd, to accord
quietly with its Prince (though never so good) is impossible; of necessity one must

comply and frame it self to the other, or else one must ruine and destroy the other. You
have this therefore to consider, whether you will hold this City by violence (for which
all the Guards and Citadels within, and all the friends could be made abroad, have been
many times too weak  or be content with the Authority we give you, to which last we
do rather advise, because no Dominion is so durable as that which is voluntary, and the
other (however your ambition may disguise it) will but conduct you to a height, where
being neither able to advance, nor continue, you must tumble down of necessity, to your
own great detriment as well as ours. But the Dukes heart was too hard for such impres|sions
as these.The Dukes Answer. He reply'd, That it was not his intention to extirpate, but to establish their
Liberty: that Cities divided were the only Cities that were servile, and not those that were
united. That if he by his conduct could clear their City of their Schisms, Ambitions, and
Animosities, he could not be said to take away, but to restore their liberty. That he did
not assume that Office out of any ambition of his own, but accepted it at the importunity
of several of the Citizens, and that they would do well to consent themselves, as their fel|lows
had done. That as to the dangers he was like to incur, he did not consider them;
It was the part of an ignoble Person to decline doing good, for fear of evil that might
follow; and of a Coward to lay aside a glorious Enterprize, upon the meer doubtfulness
of the success. That he hop'd so to demean himself, that they should in a short time
confess, they had fear'd him too much, and trusted him too little. The Senate finding by
this answer no good was to be done, consented the People should meet next morning, as
appointed, and the Government by their Authority to be transfer'd upon the Duke for a
year, with the same conditions it had been formerly given to the Duke of Calabria. On the
8th. of September 1342.1342. The Duke, accompany'd by Giovan della Tossa, all his Consorts, and
many Citizens besides, coming into the Piazza, taking the Senate with him, he mounted
upon the Ringhieria, (which are the Stairs at the foot of the Palagie de Signori) and caus'd
the Articles of agreement betwixt the Senate and Him to be read. When the Person who
read them came to the place where the Government was mentioned to be given to him for a
year, the People cry'd out, For his Life, For his Life. Francesco Rustichesi, one of the Sig|nori,
rose up to have spoke, and endeavor'd to compose the tumult; but he was interrup|ted,
and could nor be heard. So that he was chosen Lord by consent of the People, not
for a year, but for ever, and afterwards taken and carried thorow the multitude with gene|ral
acclamation.The Dukes of Athens cho|sen Prince by the People. It is a custom among the Florentines that whoever is intrusted with the
Guard of their Palace, is to be shut up in it in the absence of the Signori. That trust was at
that time in the hands of Rinieri di Giolto, who being corrupted by some of the Dukes
Creatures, receiv'd him into the Palace without any constraint. The Senate being surpriz'd,
and much affronted, return'd to their Houses, left the Palace to be plundred by the Dukes
servants, the Gonfalone del Populo to be turn'd out, and the Dukes Standard to be set up, all
which were immediatly done to the inestimable trouble of all good Men, but to the joy and
satisfaction of those who maliciously or ignorantly had consented to his exaltation. The
Duke was no sooner setled in his Dominion, but to suppress their Authority, who were the
greatest propugnators of their liberty, he forbid the Signori to meet in the Palace, and con|sign'd
them a private house.The Duke of Athens his pra|ctice in Florence. He took away the Ensigns from the Gonalonieri of the com|panies
of the People. He discharg'd all Prisoners, he recall'd the Baldi and Frescobaldi
from banishment, prohibited the wearing of arms; and to defend himself within, he
made what friends he could abroad: to that purpose he caress'd the Aretini and all others
which depended any way upon the Florentines jurisdiction. He made a peace with the Pi|sani
(though he was become a Prince) that with the more advantage he might make War
with them afterward. He took away their Bills and assignments from the Merchants, who
had lent the Sate money in their War with Lucca. He increas'd the old Gabells, and im|pos'd
new. He dissolv'd the Authority of the Signori, and in their places he set up three Ret|tori,
Barglione da Perugia, Guglielmo da Soesi, and Cerretieri Bisdomini, with whom he
constantly advised. The Taxes he laid upon the People were great, his judgments unjust,
and that humanity and preciseness which he counterfeited at first, was now turn'd most ma|nifestly
into cruelty and pride, by which means many Citizens of the more Noble and
Wealthy sort, were Condemn'd, Executed, and some time Tortur'd. And that his Go|vernment
might be as unsupportable abroad as at home, he instituted six new Rettori for
the regiment of the Country, who carryed themselves with the same insolence and oppressi|on
there, as he did in the City. He was jealous of the Nobility; though he had been of|ten
oblig'd by them, and some of them had been recall'd from their banishment by him;
yet he could not imagine it compatible with the generosity of a Noble Spirit to submit and
truckle to him. Hence it was, he apply'd himself to the People, cajoling them, and scru|ing
into their favour, by which and his power abroad, he doubted not to be able to justifie

his proceedings, how unjust and Tyrannical so ever. The month of May being come, in
which the People were wont to make merry; he caus'd the inferiour sort of the People
to be dispos'd into several Companies, gave them Ensigns and mony, and honoured them
with splendid titles, so that half of the City went up and down feasting and junketting a|mong
their Brethren, while the other half was as busie to entertain them. The fame of
his new Dominion being spread abroad, many Persons of French extraction repair'd to him,
and he prefer'd them all, as the most faithful of his friends; so that in a short time Flo|rence
was not only subject to the Frenchmen, but to the French customs and garb; all
People, Men as well as Women, without respect of indecency or inconvenience, imita|ting
them in all things; But that which was incomparably the most displeasing, was the
violence he and his Creatures us'd to the Women, without any regret. Upon these provo|cations
the Citizens were full of indignation. It troubled them to see the Majesty of their
Government prostitute and ruin'd; It troubl'd them to see Ordinances abolish'd; their
Laws abrogated; honest conversation corrupted, and civil modesty dispised; for they
who had never been accustom'd to any regal pomp whatsoever, could not without sor|row
behold the Duke environ'd with his Guards both on foot and on horse-back. But
their destruction being in his hands, they were necessitated to dissemble, and to court and
honor him outwardly whom they hated at their hearts; another inducement was the fear
they had conceiv'd upon the frequent executions, and continual taxes with which he im|poverish'd
and exhausted the City; and the Duke understood very well both their fear,
and their anger. It happen'd that Mattco di Morrozzo, to ingratiat with the Duke, or to
disintangle himself, had discover'd to him a certain Plot which the house of Medici and
some others had contriv'd against him. Morrozz The Duke was so far from inquiring into the
matter, that he caus'd the informer to be put to death, by which act he discourag'd such
as would otherwise have advertis'd him, upon occasion, and animated those who were dis|pos'd
to destroy him. He likewise caus'd the tongue of Btoni Cini to be pull'd out with
such cruelty that he died of it, and for no other cause but that he had spoke against the taxes,
which he impos'd upon the City. This last outrage compleated the rest; the People
grew perfectly mad, and the Duke perfectly odious: for that City, which was accustomed
heretofore to speak of every thing freely, and to do what they listed, could not possibly
brook to have their hands tyed, and their mouths stop'd up by a stranger. Their fury and
passion increasing at this rate, not only the Florentines (who neither know how to
maintain liberty, nor endure slavery) were incens'd, but the most servile Nation in the
World would have been inflam'd to have attempted the recovery of its freedom. Whereupon
many Citizens of all qualities and degrees resolv'd to destroy him; and it fell out, that, at
the same time, three Conspiracies were on foot by three sorts of People, the Grandees, the
People, and Artificers. Besides the General oppression, each party had its peculiar reason.
The Nobility were not restor'd to the Government; the People had lost it;Three Con|spiracies aganist the Duke at one time. and the Arti|ficers
trade was decay'd. The Archbishop of Florence, Agnolo Acciaivoli, had in his Sermons
highly magnifi'd the qualities of the Duke, and procur'd him great favour among the People;
but after he was Governor, and his tyranny became notorious, they found how the Arch|bishop
had deluded them. To make them amends for the fault he had committed, he thought
nothing could be more reasonable, than that the same hand that gave them the wound should
endeavour to cure it, and therefore he, made himself head of the first and most consider|able
Conspiracy, in which were ingag'd with him the Bardi, Rossi, Frescobaldi, Scali, Al|toviti,
Magalotti, Strozzi, and Mancini. The Principals of the second Conspiracy were
Manno and Corso Donati, and with them the Pazzi, Cavicciulli, Cerchi, and Albizzi. Of
the third Antonio Adimari was the head, and with him the Medici, Bordini, Ruccellai,
and Aldobrandini. Their design was to have kill'd him in the house of the Albizzi, whi|ther
it was suppos'd he would go on Midsummer day to see the running of the Horses; but
he went not that day, and that design was lost. The next proposition was, to kill him as
he was walking in the streets, but that was found to be difficult, because he went always
well arm'd, and well attended, and his motions being various and uncertain, they could
not tell where it was most proper to way-lay him. Then it was debated to slay him in
the Council, but that also was not without danger, because though they should kill him,
they must of necessity remain at the mercy of his Guards. Whilst these things were in de|bate
among the Conspirators, Antonio Adimari, in hopes of assistance from them, disco|ver'd
the Plot to some of his Friends in Siena, told them the Principal of the Conspirators,
and assur'd them the whole City were dispos'd to redeem themselves; whereupon one of
the Siennesi communicated the whole business to Francesco Brunelleschi (not with in|tention
to have betraid it, but in presumption he had been privy to it before) and Francs|co,
out of fear, or malice to some that were ingag'd in it, discover'd all to the Duke. Pagolo

de Mazzeccha, and Simon de Monterapoli being immediatly apprehended, they confess'd
the whole matter, with the number and quality of the Conspirators; at which the Duke
was much surpriz'd, and counsel being given him, rather to summon the Conspirators to
appear, than to secure them abruptly (because if they fled of themselves, he would be as
safe without scandal) he summon'd Adimari, who appear'd in confidence of the num|ber
of his Accomplices. Adimari was arrested, and the Duke advis'd by Francesco Brunel|leschi,
and Uguccione Buondelmonti, to betake himself to his arms, and go up and down to
their houses, and kill all of them they met. But, his force in the Town was Judg'd too
small, for that resolution, and therefore he pitch'd upon another, which (had it succeeded)
would have secured him against his Enemies, and provided him with Men. The Duke was
wont upon any great Emergencies, to call the chief Citizens together, and to advise with
them. Having first sent to prepare what force he was able, he caus'd a list of three hundred
Citizens to be made, and deliver'd to his Sergeants, to summon them to Council by their
Names, resolving when they were met, to kill, or imprison them as he pleas'd. Antonio
Adimari being secur'd, and so many great Citizens summon'd (which could not be done
without noise) many of them (and especially those who were conscious) began to su|spect,
and some refus'd absolutely to obey. The list having been brought to them all,
and perus'd by every one of them, they began to understand, and incourage one another
to take Arms, and dye manfully like Men, rather than be driven quietly like sheep to the
slaughter: so that in few hours all the Conspiracies were known, and the Conspirators u|nited:
holding Counsel among themselves, it was concluded, that the next day being the
26 of Iuly 1343. a tumult should be rais'd in the old Market-place, upon which all were to
take Arms, and excite the people to liberty. The next day, the Signal being given by
sounding a Bell (as it was agreed before) every Body took Arms, and crying out Li|berty,
Liberty, the People betook themselves to their Arms likewise, and fell to fortify
in their several Quarters, under their respective Ensigns, which was done by the contrivance
of the Conspirators.Commotion in Florence. The chief of all Families, both Nobility, and People met, and took
an Oath to live and die with one another in the destruction of the Duke (except only the
Buondelmonti, the Cavalcanti, and the four Families of the People, which consented to make
him Prince, who, with the Butchers and Rascality of the City, ran down arm'd to the Pi|azza
in defence of the Duke.) The Duke, alarm'd at these proceedings, fortifi'd his Pa|lace,
call'd home his Servants, which were lodg'd in several parts of the Town, and sally|ing
forth with them on Horseback towards the Market-place, they were many times as|saulted
by the way, and many of them slain, being forced back, and recruited with 300
fresh Horse, he was in doubt with himself, whether he had best fall upon them again, or
stand upon his guard; and in the mean time the Medici, Cavicciulli, Ruccellai, and other
families that were most disoblig'd by the Duke, were in no less fear, that if he should make
a sally, many who had taken Arms against him in the uproar, would show themselves his
friends; desirous therefore to keep him from sallying, and by that means, increasing his
numbers, drawing what force together they were able, they advanc'd towards the Market,
place, where some of their fellow Citizens had posted themselves indefence of the Duke. The
Citizens which were there in the front, and had appear'd first for their Prince, seeing them|selves
so briskly confronted, chang'd their sides, left their Duke in the lurch, and joyn'd
with their fellow Citizens, all but Uguccione Buondelmonti, who retired into the Palace,
and Giannozzo Cavalcanti, who retreating with some of his party into the New-Market,
and getting upon a bench made an earnest speech, exhorting the People to stand firm to the
Duke, and having got more force to him, to fright them (if his perswasion fail'd) he threat|ned
to kill them all, Man, Woman, and Child, if they joyn'd or persisted in any design a|gainst
him. But seeing no body follow him, nor no body near to chastise him for his in|solence,
perceiving he had troubled himself hitherto in vain, he resolv'd to tempt his for|tune
no farther, and so retir'd peaceable to his house. The conflict, in the mean time, in
the Market-place, betwixt the People and the Dukes party was great, and though the Dukes
Creatures were reinforc'd from the Palace, yet they were beaten, part taken Prisoners, and
part leaving their Horses to their Enemies, got on foot into the Palace. Whilst the contest
continu'd in the Market-place, Corso, and Amerigo Donati, with part of the People broke
up the Stinche, burn'd the Records of the Potesta, and publick Chamber, sack'd the Houses
of the Rettori, and kill'd all the Dukes Officers they could meet with. The Duke on the
other side, finding he had lost the Piazza, the whole City was become his Enemy, and no
hopes left him of being reliev'd, He resolv'd to try if by any act of kindness or huma|nity
he might work upon the People. Calling his Prisoners (therefore) to him, with
fair and gentle language he gave them their liberty, and made Antonio Adimari a Knight,
(though not at all to his satisfaction) he caus'd his Ensign to be taken down, and the Stan|dard

of the People to be set up upon the Palace. Which things being done unseasonably,
and by force, they avail'd but little. In this manner he remain'd block'd up in his Palace,
not at all delighted with his condition; having coveted too much formerly, he was now
like to lose all, and in a few days was in danger of being famish'd or slain. The Citi|zens,
to give some form to their Government, assembled themselves in the S. Reparata,
and created XIV. Citizens (half of the Nobility, and half of the People) who with their
Bishop should have full Power to model and reform the State as they pleas'd. The Autho|rity
of the Potesta they committed to VI Persons of their own election, which they were
to exercise till he that was elected should come. There were at that time many strangers
resorted to Florence, in assistance to that City, among the rest the Siennesi had sent six Em|bassadors
(of honorable condition in their own Countrey) to negotiat a peace betwixt the
Duke and the People. The People refus'd any overture, unless Guglielmo da Scesi, his Son,
and Cerrettieri Bisdomini were deliver'd into their hands, which the Duke obstinatly de|ny'd,
till the threats of those who were shut up with him in the Palace constrain'd him to
consent. Greater, doubtless, is the insolence and contumacy of the People, and more
pernicious the mischiefs which they do, whilst they are in pursuit of their Liberty, than when
they have acquir'd it. Guglielmo and his Son were brought forth, and deliver'd up a|mong
thousands of their Enemies; his Son was a young Gentleman, not yet arriv'd at
eighteen years of age; yet neither his youth, his comliness, nor innocence were able to
preserve him; those who could not get near enough to do it whilst he was alive, wounded
him when he was dead; and as if their swords had been partial, and executed the dictates
of their fury with too much moderation, they fell to it with their teeth, and their hands,
biting his flesh, and tearing it to pieces. And that all their Senses might participate in their
revenge, having feasted their ears upon their groans, their eyes upon their wounds, and
their touch upon their bowels (which they rent out of their bodies with their hands) their
taste must (likewise) be treated and regal'd, that their inward parts, as well as their
outward, might have a share of the Ragoust. This Barbarous outrage, how fatal soever it
was to them two, was very lucky to Cerrettieri, for the People being tyr'd in the formali|ties
of their execution, forgot they had any more to punish, and left him in the Palace, not
so much as demanded, from whence the next night he was safely convey'd by his Relations,
and friends. The People having satiated themselves upon the Blood of those two, the peace
was concluded;The Duke expell'd. the Duke to depart safely himself, and all that belong'd to him, for which
he was to renounce all his Claim and Authority in Florence, and to ratify his renunciation
when he came out of the Florentine Dominions to Casentino. The Articles being agreed,
on the VI. of August, attended by a multitude of Citizens, the Duke departed from Florence,
and arriv'd at Casentino, where he ratify'd the renuntiation, but so unwillingly, that had
not Conte Simone threatned to carry him back to Florence, it had never been done. This
Duke (as his actions demonstrate) was covetous, cruel, difficult of access, and insolent in
his answers. Not being so much effected with the kindness and benevolence of People, as
with their servitude and servility;His Cha|racter. he chose to be fear'd rather than belov'd. Nor was the
shape and contexture of his Body less contemptible, than his manners were odious. He was
very little, exceeding black, his beard long and thin, not apart about him, but concurr'd
to make him despicable. In this manner the exhorbitancies of his administration in ten
Months time depriv'd him of his Dominion, which had been plac'd upon him by the Coun|sels
of ill Men. These accidents happening thus in the City, all the Towns under the juris|diction
of Florence, took courage, and began to stand up for their liberty; so that in a
short time Arrezzo, Castiglione, Pistoia, Volterra, Colle St. Gimignano rebell'd, and the whole
territory of Florence (after the example of its Metropolis) recover'd its freedom. After the
Duke and his Creatures were removed, the XIV. chief Citizens, and the Bishop, consulting
together, thought it better to pacify the People with peace, than to provoke them again by
War, and therefore pretended to be as well pleas'd with their liberty as their own. They
sent Embassadors therefore to Arrezzo, to renounce the Authority they had over them,
and to enter into an alliance of amity with them, that though they might not hereafter
command them as subjects, they might (upon occasion) make use of them as friends.
With the rest of the Cities, they made as good terms as they could, retaining amity with
them all. This resolution being prudently taken, succeeded very happily; for in a few
months Arrezzo, and all the other Towns return'd to their Obedience, and it is frequent|ly
seen, to decline, or renounce things voluntarily, is the way to gain them more readily,
and with less danger and expence, than to pursue them with all the passion and impetuo|sity
in the World. Affairs abroad being compos'd in this manner, they apply'd them|selves
to a settlement at home, and after some debates and alterations betwixt the Nobility
and the People, it was concluded the third part of the Signoria r Senat should consist

of the Nobility, and half the other Magistracies to be executed by them. The City (as is
said before) was divided into six parts, out of which sixth, six Signori were chosen, (one
out of every sixth) only by accident now and then their number was increas'd to XII. or
XIII.New Refor|mation. and reduc'd it again to six afterwards; at length they resolv'd to reform in that parti|cular,
either because the Sesti or sixths were ill distributed, or else (designing more Au|thority
to the Nobility) they thought it convenient to increase the number of the Senators.
Hereupon they divided the City into Quarters, and in every Quarter, three Signori were
created, to superinspect it. The Gonfaloniere della Iustitia, and Gonfalonieri of the Popular
Companies, were laid aside, and instead of them they created XII. Buon-Huomini, and
VIII. Consiglieri, four of each sort.
The Common Wealth being setled in this Method, might have continued quiet and
happy, had the Grandees been contented to have fram'd it themselves to such modesty of
Conversation as is requisit in a Civil Government. But their practices were quite contrary;
when they were but private Persons, no Body was good enough to be their Companions,
and being in Office, scarce any too good to be their Subjects, every day producing new
instances of their Arrogance and Pride, insomuch that the People were exceedingly troubl'd,
to consider with what impatience and fury they had remov'd one Tyrant to make room for
a thousand. In this manner things stood at that time, the insolence of one side, and the
indignation of the other fermenting to that degree, that the Chief of the People (complain|ing
of the Enormity of their great Ones, and their haughtiness to the People and to the Bi|shop)
desir'd that he would be an instrument to restrain the Grandees to their share in the
other Offices, and effect that the Senate might consist only of the People. The Bishop was
naturally a good Man, but easie and unconstant; from that unconstancy of temper it was,
that his Associats first wrought upon him to favour the Duke of Athens, and afterwards
persuaded him against him: in the late Reformation he appear'd highly for the Nobility,
now upon the instance and solicitation of the Popular Citizens, he was as earnest for the
People, and supposing to have found the same irresolution in other People, as was eminent
in himself, he fancy'd himself able to prevail with the Nobility to consent. Hereupon con|voking
the XIV. (who were as yet in possession of their Authority,) with the best lan|guage
he could use, he exhorted them to resign the dignity of the Senate to the People, if they
bare any respect to the tranquillity of the City, or their own safety and preservation. But
these Words wrought a contrary effect in the minds of the Nobility Ridolfo de Bardi repre|hending
him very smartly, upbraided the Levity and Treachery of his behaviour with the
Duke, and concluded at last, that the Honours and imployments they were in, they had ac|quir'd
with hazzard, and would defend them with the same; and in this squable he and his
Brethren left the Bishop, and went to the rest of the Nobility to communicate with them.
The People were made acquainted with their answer on the otherside, and whilst the Gran|dees
were providing what strength they could for the defence of their Senators, the Com|mons
thought it no time to attend for Orders, but ran immediatly to their Arms, and with
them to the Palace, calling out to the Nobility to renounce. The noise and tumult were
great; the Signori found themselvs forsaken; for the Grandees finding the People univer|sally
in Arms, durst not appear, but kept themselves close at home as obscurely as they
could: whereupon the Popular Senators, endeavouring to pacifie the People, alledg'd that
they were honest and good Men, and prevail'd (though with great difficulty) that they
might be sent safe to their houses.The Nobilty depos'd. The Senators of the Nobility being dismiss'd, the Office
was taken away from the four Grand Cousellors, and transfer'd upon XII. of the People, and
the eight Popular Senators which remain'd. They restor'd the Gonfaloniere della Iustitia,
and XVI. Gonfalonieri of the Companies of the People, and reorm'd all Counsels in such
manner that the Government remain'd entirely in the People. When those exorbitances
happen'd, there was a great scarcity in the City, which occasion'd the discontents both of
Nobility and People (the People for want of Victuals, the Nobility for want of Command)
and gave incouragement to Andrea Strozzi to usurp upon their liberty. Andrea selling his
Corn at a cheaper rate than his Neigbours, had greater resort of poor People to his House,
which he observing, mounted on Horseback one morning, with several of the Rabble at his
heels, he cry'd out to the rest to take Arms, and in a few hours he got together more than
4000 Men, with whom he march'd to the Palace of the Senate, and demanded to have it
open'd: but the Senators partly by threatning, and partly by force, disingag'd themselves
of them, and afterward, when they were gone frighted them so with their Proclamati|ons,
that by little and little they dissolv'd, and went every Man to his Home, and left
Andrea alone to escape as he could. Though this accident was rash, and had the common
end of such desperate attempts, yet it gave no little hopes to the Nobility of prevailing
against the People, seeing the Refuse and Rascallity of the City had an animosity against

them. That they might not slip so fair an occasion, it was resolv'd that they should fortify
themselves with their assistance (if they could gain it) and recover by force,The Nobili|ty attempt to recover their Authority. what by in|justice
was taken from them. And so bold they grew in their confidence of Vctory, that
they began to provide Arms publickly, to fortify their Houses, and send to their friends in
Lombardy for help and supplies. The People and their Senators were as busie on the other
side,The People Arm against them. they provided themselves with what Arms they could get, and sent to the Sanesi, and
Perugini for relief. The Auxiliaries on both sides being arriv'd, the whole City was im|mediatly
in Arms. The Nobility had posted themselves in three places on this side the
River Arnus, at the Palace of the Cvicciulli near S. Iohns; at the Palaces of the Pzzi,
and Donati near S. Piero Maggiore; and at the Palace of the Cavalcanti in the new-Mar|ket:
those of the Nobility who were on the other side of the River, had fortifi'd the Brid|ges
and Streets which were in the way to their Houses. The Nerli possess'd themselves of
the Ponte alla Carraia; the Frescohaldi and Mannelli, of S. Trimita; the Rossi and Bardi
were upon their guard at the old Bridge; and the Rubaconte. The People in the mean
time form'd themselves into a posture under the Gonfalone della Giustitia, and the Ensigns
of the People, and being drawn up in array, it was thought best immediately to fall on;
the first that march'd were the Medici and Rondinelli who assaulted the Cavicciulli on that
side which is towards the Piazza de S. Giovanni. The service was very hot (great stones
being tumbled upon them from above, and vollies of Arrows sent liberally among them
from below) and continued three hours compleat; but the numbers of the People increa|sing,
and no relief like to get near them, the Cavicciulli submitted to their multitudes, and
surrendred. The People sav'd the House and the furniture, only they took away their
Arms, and Commanded them to distribute and disperse themselves into such Popular Houses
as were there acquaintance and friends. The Cavicciulli being beaten from their Post, the
Pazzi and Donati (being less powerful) were sooner remov'd. The Cavalcanti were only re|maining
on that side of the River, yet more considerable than the other, both in respect of
their numbers  situation. But they, seeing all the Gonfalonieri advancing against them, where
as three of them only had overpower'd the rest, surrendred like their Nighbours without any
remarkable defence: and now three parts of the City were in the Hands of the People, there
was but one left in the Power of the Nobility, but more difficult and inaccessible, by rea|son
it was so secure by the River Arno, the Bridges and Avenues were of necessity to be
clear'd before any good could be done, and they (as is said before) were abundantly pro|vided.
The first of them that was assaulted was the old Bridge, which was as bravely de|fended,
and the People repuls'd. Finding their further Attempts there would be but in
vain, they try'd what could be done at the Ponte Rubaconte; but finding their entertainment
no better, they left four Gonfaloni, and some other Ensigns to block up those Passes, and
march'd with the rest to the Ponte alla Carraia. The Nerli had the defence of that Quar|ter,
and behav'd themselves Valiantly, yet their Bridge (as having no Towers) being
weaker or else overlaid with the numbers of their Enemies, (which were much increas'd
by the accession of the Capponi and other Families about them) they were on every side op|press'd,
forc'd from their Barricadoes, and constrain'd to retire. When they were Defea|ted,
they advanc'd against the Rossi, and from them against the Frescobaldi, overwhelming
them both, the whole Populace beyond the River being come in to their assistance. The
Bardi was the only party remaining, but that so obstinatly couragious, neither the fortune
of their Comerades, the unanimity of the People against them, nor the impossibility of re|lief
could prevail with them to surrender, but they would rather die fighting, or see their
Houses pillag'd or burn'd, than submitted themselves quietly into the hands of their
Enemies. And they defended themselves; for though many times they were assaulted,
both at the old Bridge, and the Ponte Rubaconte, the People were alway repuls'd, and with
considerable loss. There was in old time a Lane to pass from the Via Romana, betwixt the
Palaces of the Pitti to the Wall upon S. Gorges-hill. To this Lane the People sent six Gon|falonieri
with Orders to fall upon the Bardi behind, who pursued them so effectually, the
Bardi were disheartned, and the People prevail'd; those of the Bardi who were appointed
for the keeping of the Barricadoes, no sooner hearing that their houses were attack'd, but they
quitted their Posts, and ran in in hopes to defend them. By this means the Barracades at
the old Bridge were won and the Bardi discomfitted, who (as many as could) betook
themselves to their heals, and were received by the Quaratesi, Panzanesi, and Mozzi. The
People (especially the baser sort) greedy of Prey, plunder'd their Houses; demolish'd
their Castles; and when they had done, burn'd them all with such inhumanity, as the
greatest Enemy the City had would have been asham'd to have committed. The Nobility
being utterly subdued, the People took upon them the Government of the State, and be|cause
it consisted of three sorts (the more potent, the middle sort and the base) it was or|dain'd

that the more potent should have the Nomination of two Senators; the midle sort of
three, and the meaner of three. The Gonfalonieri to be chosen (Alternatim) of the one
and the other. Besides this, all the Old Laws against the Nobility were reviv'd and put
in force,The Nobili|ty utterly de|press'd. and to weaken them the more, many of them were mingl'd with the Common
People. The destruction of the Nobility was so great at this time, and their party so ir|recoverably
debilitated, that not daring to take Arms again, against the People, they be|came
pusilanimous and abject, which was the Occasion that Florence lost not only its Gen|try
but its Generosity also. From this depression of the Grandees, the City continued qui|et
to the year 1353, in which interval happen'd the Famous Pestilence (so Eloquently ce|lebrated
by Giovanni Boccacio) in which there died in Florence above 96000 People. The
first War the Florentines made, was against the Visconti, being provok'd by the Ambition
of the Archbishop, who at that time was Prince of Milan: which War was no sooner fi|nished,
but new factions began in the City; for though the Nobility was so cow'd, and
intimidated, there was no danger of them; yet fortune had her ways to create them new
troubles by new and different dissentions.



THE
HISTORY
OF
FLORENCE.
Book III.
THE great and natural animosities betwixt the People and the Nobility, arising
from an ambition in the one to command, and an aversion in the other to obey, are
the springs and fountains of all the calamities incident to a City: and indeed
there is scarce any thing dangerous or troublesome to a Common-wealth, but takes
its original and nourishment from their diversity of humour. This was it which kept Rome
divided. This was it (if it be lawful to compare great things with little) which kept Flo|rence
divided, though in each City with different effects. For, in Rome, the enmity be|twixt
the people and the Nobility was determined by Expostulation and Reason; in Flo|rence,
by the Sword. In Rome, those things were setled and compos'd by Law, which, in
Florence, were scarce done by the slaughter and banishment of many of their best Citizens.
Rome increased still in its Military Vertue; but that in Florence was utterly exhaust. From
a primitive equality of its Citizens, Rome was brought to an immense inequality: whereas
Florence on the contrary, from a vast inequality, was reduced to a strange equality. Which
diversity of effects must have certainly proceeded from diversity in their designs. The
people of Rome desired no more than to share and communicate with the Nobility in the
great Oices of the City. The people of Florence not only desired, but fought and con|tended
to have the Government to themselves, with perfect exclusion to the Nobility: and
the desires of the Romans being more reasonable, there importunity was the more suppor|table
by the Nobles, so that they condescended without coming to blows; and after some
small controversie and dispute, it was concluded a Law should be made, by which the people
should be satisfied, and their Dignities preserved to the Nobility.
On the other side, the demands of the people of Florence were extravagant and unjust;
upon which score the Nobility preparing for the defence, their differences determined in
banishment and bloud: and the Laws which ensued were fram'd more to the advantage of
the Victor, than the benefit of the Publick. Hence it proceeded, that the success of
the people in Rome, rendred that City more potent and considerable; for the people being
admitted to the administration of the Magistracy, Armies, and Empire, equally with the
Nobles, they became inspir'd with the same Vertue and Magnanimity as they: and as their
Vertue increased, their power increased with it.
But in Florence the people prevailing, devested the Nobility of their Authority; and if
they had a mind to recover it, it was necessary by their conversation and behaviour not only

to be, but to profess themselves like the people. And this was the cause of the changing
their Arms, the variation of their Titles, and Families which was frequent in those times
among the Nobility, to recommend them to the Commons, and make them pass amongst
them: so that the Eminency of their Arms, and the Generosity of their minds, (for both
which the Nobility was formerly famous) was spent and expir'd, and not to be reviv'd in
the people, where the least spark of it was not to be found; which rendered Florence every
day more abject and base. And whereas Rome, transported with its own Vertue, grew to
that height of Pride, that it could not subsist longer without a Prince. Florence was reduced to
that pass, that a wise Legislator might have form'd the Government according to what scheme
and model he pleased. All which, by perusing of the preceeding books, will be obvious to
any body. Having shewn therefore the foundation of Florence; the original of its Li|berty;
the occasion of its Dissention; and how the factions of the Nobility and people
concluded with the Tyranny of the Duke of Athens and the destruction of the Nobility:Emulation betwixt the iddle and the meaner sort of people.
it remains now, I should discourse of the Emulations betwixt the people and the multitude,
and several accidents which they produced.
The power of the Nobility being depress'd, and the War with the Arch-Bishop of Millan
at an end; there appeared no respect of future contention in Florence: But the ill fate of
our City, the ill conduct of their Affairs, suffered a new Emulation to spring up (be|twixt
the Families of the Albizi and Ricci) which produced as great division in the Town,
as was at first betwixt the Buondelmonti and the Uberti, and afterwards betwixt the Cerchi
and Donati. The Popes (who had then their residence in France) and the Emperors who
resided in Germany, to make good their reputation in Italy, had many times, upon several
occasions, supplied us with multitude of Souldiers of all Nations, English, Dutch, and Bri|tains.
The Wars ended, and they out of pay, being Souldiers of Fortune, they were con|strain'd to make bold sometimes with one Prince, and sometimes with another; and force
them to contribution. In the year, 1353, it happened one of the Companies came into
Tuscany (under the Command of Monsieur Real of Provence) and put the whole Country
into a fear: whereupon the Florentines not only made publick provision of men, but several
private Citizens (and the Albizi and Ricci among the rest) furnished themselves with Arms
for their proper defence. There was a mortal hatred betwixt these two Families, each of
them aspiring at the Government, and conspiring the destruction of the other. However
as yet they were not come to Hostility; only they clash'd, and interfer'd in their Counsels,
and in the executions of the Magistracy. But upon this occasion, the City being arm'd,
there happen'd a quarrel, by accident, in the old Market place; to which the People, that
were near, flock'd, as they do on all such occasions. To the Ricci it was reported the Al|bizi
had fallen upon some of their Family. To the Albizi, that the Ricci were come out
in defiance of them. Hereupon the whole City got together; and no small difficulty it
was to the Magistrate to restrain either of the Families, or to put an end to a Conflict
which was begun by chance, without the fault or contrivance of either. This accident,
though meerly contingent, reviv'd their animosity, and put them both upon designs of in|creasing
their Parties. And because, by the ruine of the Nobility, the Citizens were re|duced
to such an equality, that the Magistrates were become more venerable than formerly;
they resolved both of them to advance their interest rather by ordinary means, than private
violence. We have declar'd before, how, after the Victory of Charles the First, the Guelfs
were created Magistrates; and great authority given them over the Ghibilin Faction:
which authority and preheminence, time, accident, and their new divisions had so far ener|vated,
that the Ghibilins were grown into the Government, and exercised the principal
Offices as well as the Guelfs. Uguccione de Ricci being at that time the head of that Family,
prevail'd to have the Laws against the Ghibilins renewed: to which Faction, it was sup|pos'd
by many, the Albizi were inclin'd; whose Original being anciently from Arezzo,
they transplanted from thence, and setled in Florence: so that Uguccione design'd by the re|novation
of those Laws, to render that Family incapable of any great Office; providing
thereby, that it should be criminal for any person descended from the Ghibilins, to exercise
the Magistracy. This practice of Uguccione was discovered to Piero, Son of Philippo de
gli Albizi, who resolved to connive at it; presuming he should declare himself a Ghibilin,
if he opposed it. These Laws, though renewed by the prevalence, and ambition of the
Ricci, substracted nothing from the reputation of the Albizi, but were the foundation of
many mischiefs. Nor indeed can a Republick make any Law so pernicious, as a Law of
retro- spection. Piero having rather promoted, than resisted those Laws; that which his
enemies intended as an impediment, proved a means and occasion of his preferment: for, be|ing
made the chief person to super- inspect the execution of those Laws, he exercised more
authority than before; and became the only favourite of the Faction of the Guelfs. And,

because in these Laws there was no definition of a Ghibilin, nor no Magistrate deputed to
discover them, they were of little importance; only the Captains were appointed to inquire
them out, and to admonish them, that they were not to take the Magistracy upon them;
if they did, they should be liable to a penalty. Whereupon, those who were afterwards
incapacitated for the Magistracy, were called Ammoniti.The Ammoniti But, at length, the Captains grow|ing
bold and audacious in their office, without any regard whether they were conscious or
not; they admonished who they pleased, as their avarice or animosity directed them.
So that from the year 1357, (in which this Law was renewed) to the year 1366, there
were more than 200 Citizens admonished. By which means, the Captains, and the Faction
of the Guelfs were grown great and considerable; especially Piero de gli Albizi, Lapo da
Castiglionochio, and Carlo Strozzi, for the fear of being admonished, made all people respect
them. And, though the insolence of their proceedings disgusted many more; yet none
look'd upon it with so much indignation as the Family of the Ricci, who had been the oc|casion
of that disorder, which was not only like to be the ruine of the Common-wealth, but
the promotion and advancement of their Enemies, quite contrary to what they designed.
Uguccione therefore (being one of the Senate, to put an end to those inconveniences which
he by accident had created) obtain'd a new Law; that to the six Captains, three more
should be added; two of them to be chosen out of the inferior Mechanicks: and prevail'd
that the Ghibilins should not be convicted but by 24 of the Guelfs, deputed particularly to
that office. For the time, these Laws in some measure tempered the exorbitance of the
Captains so as their admonitions lost much of their terror; and if any, they were but
few that were admonished. Notwithstanding the emulation betwixt the Albizi and Ricci
continued; their leagues, practices, and consultations going on with more eagerness, as
their fury suggested. In this distraction the City continued from the year, 1366, to the
year 1371; at which time the Guelfs recovered their power.
In the Family of the Buondelmonti, there was a Gentleman called Benchi; who for his
Gallantry in the Wars against the Pisans, was prefer'd to be one of the people; and by that
means qualified to be a Senator. But when he expected to be admitted into the Senate, a
Decree was made, that no person of Noble Extraction, that was become one of the people,
should be received into the Senate. This Decree was highly offensive to Benchi, who, upon
consultation with Piero de gli Albizi, resolv'd with his admonitions to depress the meaner
sort of the people, and make themselves Governors of the City. And indeed, by his in|fluence
upon the Nobility, and Piero's upon the wealthiest of the Citizens, the Faction of
the Guelfs began to grow more considerable: for with their new models and regulations
they ordered things so, that the Captains and 24 Citizens were wholly at their disposing;
their admonitions exercised with as much audacity as formerly; and the house of the Al|bizi
(being head of that Faction) increased exceedingly. The Ricci in the mean time
were not behind hand in using all their interest and friends to obstruct their designs; so
that every one lived in great apprehension as fore-seeing their destruction was approach|ing.
Whereupon many Citizens out of affection to their Country assembled in S. Piero
Scheraggio; and having discoursed of their disorders among themselves, they went after|wards
to the Senate, to whom, one of the most eminent among them, made this harrangue.
Most Magnificent Lords;The Citizens Oration to the Senate. we have many of us doubted, whether to assemble by private
order, (though upon publick occasion) might not be offensive, and render us remarkable
for our presumption, and punishable for our ambition. But when we considered, that
daily, without the least caution or regard, many Citizens do meet, and confer; not for
any benefit to the Common-wealth, but in pursuit of their own private designs: We
presum'd, that if they were permitted to meet, and Conspire against the peace of their
Country, without displeasure to your Lordships; those whose design was nothing but its
preservation and prosperity, needed not to fear your reproof. If therefore we have not
incurr'd your Lordships disfavour we are not much solicitous what others judge of us,
because we find they are as indifferent what we think of them. The love we bear to
our Country, most Magnificent Lords, was that which assembled us at first, and now pre|sents
us before you, to remonstrate our distractions; (which (though too great) encrease
daily upon our hands,) and to offer our utmost assistance to remove them. How difficult
soever their Enterprise may appear we cannot despair of success; if laying aside private
respects, you would be pleased with publick force to exert your authority, The corrup|tion
of their Cities in Italy, has vitiated ours: for since Italy freed it self from the
yoke of the Empire, all the Towns (wanting their former restraint) lew out into extreams,
and ordain'd Laws and Governors, not as free men, but as people divided into Factions.
From this Fountain all our miseries, all our disorders do spring. In the first place, no
friendship nor integrity is to be found among the Citizens, unless among those whose

wickedness makes them faithful, having been formerly engaged together in some villainous
action, either against their Neighbour, or Country. Religion, and the fear of God, is ut|terly
extinguished. Promises and Oaths are binding no farther than they are profitable;
and used not for a tye, but a snare, and as a means to facilitate their cheats which are al|ways
more honourable, by how much their success is less difficult and dangerous. Hence
it is, that vitious and mischievous men are commended for their industry; and good
men, which are innocent and quiet, are reckoned for sots. And certainly, as there is no
sort of corruption but may be found in Italy, so there are no sort of people more unhap|pily
adapted to receive it. The young men are idle, the old men lascivious; all sexes, all
ages, all places full of licentious brutality above the correction of the Laws. Hence
springs that avarice among the Citizens; and that ambition, not of true glory, but of
dishonourable preferment; which, being accompanied with hatred enmity, schism, and
dissention, are commonly followed by executions, banishments, affliction of good men,
and exaltation of evil: for good men depending upon their innocence, and not looking
abroad for any thing extroardinary, either to advance, or defend themselves do too often
miscarry without either, and become the sad objects of the cruelty of Usurpers. This
creates inclination to parties, and increases their power; ill people siding for covetous|ness,
ambition, revenge, or some other sinister end; and good people for fear: and that
which renders our condition more deplorable, is, to behold the Contrivers and Ring|leaders
of all, (as if a word could make them innocent, and consecrate the iniquity of
their actions) guilding, or rather decking over their ill designs with some Illustrious Title:
for, being all enemies to liberty, let them pretend as they please, either to defend an Opti|macy,
or Populacy, the result must be destruction: for the fruit they expect from their
Victory, is not the honour of having delivered their Country, but the satisfaction of ha|ving
mastered their enemies, and usurped the dominion to themselves: and being arrived
at that height, what is there so unjust, what is there so cruel, what is there so ravenous as
they? Hence-forward Laws are made, not for publick benefit, but their private advan|tage,
hence-forward, War, and peace, and Amity is concluded; not for common honour,
but particular humor. And if the other Cities of Italy are repleat with these disorders,
ours is much more: Our Laws, our Statutes, and Civil Ordinances, are made according to
the ambition and capricio of the Conqueror; and not according to the true interest of
people that would be free: whence it follows, that one Faction is no sooner extinguished,
but another succeeds: for that City which would maintain it self by Faction rather than
by Law, can never be quiet: when one party prevails, and depresses its rival beyond the
power of opposition, it sub-divides of necessity, and falls out with it self; and then all
goes to wrack, the people not being able to defend themselves with those private Laws
wich were made at first for their preservation. That these things are true the ancient
and modern dissentions in our own City can sadly demonstrate. When the Ghibilins
were destroyed, it was every mans judgment the Guelfs would have lived honourably and
quietly a long time after: and yet it was not long before they divided into the Factions
of the Neri and Bianchi: when the Bianchi were over-powred, new parties arose, and
new troubles attended them; sometimes fighting in behalf of the Exiles, and sometimes
quarrelling betwixt the Nobility and the People; and (to give that to others, which either
we could not, or would not possess quietly our selves) committing our liberty sometimes
to King Robert, sometimes to his brother, and at last to the Duke of Athens; never fixing
or reposing in any Government; as not being agreed to live free, nor contented to be ser|vile.
Nay, so much was our State dispos'd to division, that rather than acquiesce in the
administration of a King, it prostituted it self to the regiment of an Agobbian, of mean
and ignominious Extraction. The late Duke of Athens cannot be mentioned with any
honour to this City; yet his insolence and Tyranny may make us wiser for the future.
Being in Arms at his expulsion, we fell to it among our selves and fought with more
fury one against another, than we had ever done before; till at length the Nobility was
overcome, and at the mercy of the people: and it was the general opinion (their insup|portable
pride and ambition being taken down) there could be no more faction or troubles
in Florence: but we have found to our cost, how false and fallacious mans judgment is.
The pride and ambition of the Nobility was not extinct, but transmigrated into the
people; who, by degrees, grew as impatient for authority as they; and having no other way
to attain it, but by domstick dissention, they reviv'd the obsolete names of Guelfs, and
of Ghibilins; which it had been happy for this City never, to have known. And, that
nothing which is humane, may be perpetual and stable; it is the pleasure of the Heavens
that in all States or Governments whatsoever, some fatal Families should spring up for
their ruine and destruction. Of this, our City can afford as many, and as lamentable in|stances

as any of her neighbours; as owing its miseries not only to one or two, but seve|ral
of those Families: as first, the Buondelmonti and Uberti; next, the Donati and the
Cerchi; and now, the Ricci and Albizi, (a shameful and ridiculous thing.) We have not
enumerated our divisions nor deduc'd our ill customs so high, to upbraid or to discourage
you by them; but rather as a memorial of their causes, to shew that they are in our me|mory
as well as yours; and to exhort you by their example, not to be diffident or timerous
in correcting them. For in those days the power of the Nobility was so great, and their
alliances so considerable; the Laws and Civil Magistrates were too weak to restrain them:
but now the Emperor having no power, the Pope no influence; all Italy, and particular|ly
this City, reduc'd to such a parity, as to be able to Govern our selves; where is the diffi|culty?
What impediment remains, why this Common-wealth (in spight of all examples
to the contrary) may not only be united, but reform'd and improv'd by new Laws and
Constitutions, were your Lordships disposed to create them? To which good work, we
do most humbly importune you, not out of private passion, so much as publick compassion
for our Country. Our corruption is great, and tis you only can correct the rage, and
expel the contagion that spreads and luxuriates among us. The disorders of our Ance|stors
are not imputable to the nature of the men, but to the iniquity of those times;
which being now altered, gives this City fair hopes, by the institution of better Laws, to
better its fortune; whose malignity is easily to be overcome by a prudent restraint of am|bition;
a seasonable inhibition of such customs as propagate Faction; and a discreet
election and adherence to such things as are compatible with our freedom. And better it
is you do it now legally of your selves, than by deferring it, to divert that office upon the
people and make them do it by force.
The Signori mov'd then by these arguments, (which they had fram'd to themselves be|fore)
and by authority and encouragement afterwards, commissionated 56 Citizens to
superintend for the safety of the Common-wealth. True it is, many men are more proper
to preserve good Laws, than to make them; and these Citizens imploy'd themselves more
in extirpating the present Factions, than providing against new; by which means they suc|ceeded
in neither: for not taking away the occasion of the new; and one of the present
Factions being more potent than the other, it could not be done without great danger to the
Common-wealth.New Refor|mation. However, they depriv'd three of the Family of the Albizi; and as ma|ny
of the Ricci of all Magistracy (unless of the Guelfish party) for three years; in which
number, Piero de gli Albizi, and Uguccione de Ricci were two. They prohibited all Citi|zens
for the coming into the Palace, unless the Senate was sitting. They decreed, that in case
of batterry or unjust interruption in the possession of their Estates, it should be lawful to
accuse any man (though of the Nobility) to the Council, and to make them answer to their
Charge. These Laws had greater reflection upon the Ricci than the Albizi; for though
they were equally intended the Ricci suffered most by them: Piero indeed was shut out of
the Palace of the Signori; but at the Palace of the Guelfs (where his authority was great)
his entrance was free; and though he and his Comrades were forward enough in their ad|monitions
before they were much forwarder now, and new accidents occurr'd to make them
yet worse.Gregory XI. holds his Resi|dence at Avig|non. Gregory XI. was Pope at that time, whose residence being at Avignon, he go|verned
Italy by Legates, (as his Predecessors had done before him.) These Legates being
proud and rapacious, had brought great calamity upon several of the Cities. One of these
Legates being at that time in Bologna, took the advantage of a scarcity which was in Flo|rence,
and resolved to make himself Lord of Tuscany: to which end, he not only omitted
to supply the Florentines with provisions but to deprive them utterly of all other relief, as
soon as the spring appeared, and gave opportunity for his motion, he invaded them with a
great Army, hoping they would be easily conquered, because they were both famished, and
disarm'd: and possibly his design might have taken, had not his Army been mercenary, and
corrupt; for the Florentines having no other weapons to defend themselves, betook them|selves
to their bags, and paid his Army 130000 Florins to draw off. To begin a War, is in
any mans power; but, alas, no body can end one. This War was commenc'd by the am|bition
of the Legate, but prosecuted by the indignation of the Florentines; who entred
into an immediate League with Monsieur Barnabo, and all the Cities which were at enmity
with the Church. To manage it, they created eight Citizens, whom they invested with
absolute authority of proceeding without appeal,New Com|mission for the management of the War. and disbursing without account. This
War against the Pope, though Uguccione was dead, reviv'd those who had followed the
fortunes of the Ricci, who in opposition to the Albizi, had favoured Barnabo, and appear|ed
against the Church; and the rather, because the eight were all enemies to the Guelfs:
whereupon Piero de gli Albizi, Lapo da Castiglionochio, Carlo Strozzi, and others, united to
defend themselves against their adversaries. And while the eight great Citizens were im|ployed

in the management of the War, and they in their admonitions, the War continued
three years, till the death of that Pope. However, it was carried on with so universal satis|faction,
that the Eight were continued yearly in their Office, and got the Title of Santi;
notwithstanding they had sequestred the riches of the Churches, forc'd the Clergy to the
execution of their Functions, and despised the censures of the Pope, So much did the
Citizens at that time prefer the advantage of their Country, before the quiet of their Con|sciences:
and so earnest were they to make it appear to the Church, that, as when they
were friends, they had power to defend it; so now being enemies, they were as able to di|stress
it; having put all Romagna, la Marca, and Perugia, into Rebellion. But, though they
were able to maintain War, at this rate, against the Pope, they could not so well defend
themselves against their Captains and Factions. The indignation and hatred the Guelfs
had conceived against the Eight, augmented their insolence; and they affronted them as
well as the rest of the chief of the Citizens. Nor was the arrogance of the Captains in|ferior
to the insolence of the Guelfs; they had made themselves more formidable than the
Signori; and men went with more awe and reverence to their Houses, than to the Senators
Palace: insomuch, that not an Embassador was sent to Florence, but he receiv'd Audience
from, and had particular commission to the Captains. Pope Gregory being dead, this City
had no more Wars abroad; yet, at home, it was in great confusion: the imperiousness of
the Guelfs was grown insupportable, and no way visible to suppress them: it was judged
therefore necessary to take Arms, and commit the superiority to the decision of Fortune.
On the Guelfs side there were all the ancient Nobility, and the greatest part of the more
powerful Citizens; of whom, as (we have said) Lapo, Piero, and Carlo were the chief. On
the other side, were all the inferior sort of the people headed by the Eight, and assisted by
Georgio Scali, Tomaso Strozzi, the Ricci, the Alberti, and the Medici. The rest of the
multitude (as it happens always in such cases) joyned with the discontents. The power
of their adversaries seemed very considerable to the Guelfs; and their danger great, if any
Senate should prove their enemies, and go about to destroy them: desirous to prevent it,
they assembled together; where, examining the State and condition of the City, they found
the persons which had been admonished, were so numerous, that they had thereby disob|lig'd
most of their Citizens and made them their enemies. They could propose no other
remedy; but as they had degraded them of their honours, so to banish them the City, seize
upon the Senators Palace by force, and constrain the whole Town to come over to their
side, according to the example of the Guelfs their Predecessors; whose quiet and security
was to be attributed wholly to their banishing their adversaries. As to the design, all of
them agreed; but they differed about the time. It was in the year 1377, in the month of
May,1377. when Lapo conceiving it unsafe to defer; acquainted them that delays were dangerous
especially to them; considering, that in the next Senate Salvestro de Medici might be cho|sen
Gonfaloniere,A Conspiracy of the Guelfs. who was a known enemy to their sect. Piero de gli Albizi was of ano|ther
sentiment, and thought it best to protract; in respect that more force would be ne|cessary,
which were not to be got together privately; and to raise them publickly, was to
run themselves into palpable danger. His judgment therefore was, that they should have
patience till S. Iohn's day, which was at hand; at which time, in regard it was one of the
greatest Festivals, and great resort would come to the City of Course, they might convey
in what numbers they pleased, without danger of discovery. And to obviate their appre|hension
of Salvestro, he proposed to have him admonished; and if that would not do, to
put the change upon him, by some fraud or artifice in the imborsation; and foist in some
other of the Colledg of his quarter, to defeat him securely of that Office. This last opi|nion
being approved, it was resolved to put off! though Lapo consented unwillingly, ur|ging,
that delay was uncertain; that no time can, in all circumstances, be convenient; and
that he who expects a perfect oportunity, seldom attempts any thing; and when he does,
it turns commonly to his own disadvantage. However, they proceeded to admonish him,
but could not hinder Salvestro. And, for the change, the Eight had got an inkling of that,
and took care to prevent it;The Conspi|racy defeated. so that Salvestro was drawn for Gonfaloniere by Alamanno de
Medici. Being of a Noble Popular Family, he could not endure that the People should be
oppressed by the power of a few great persons; resolving therefore with himself, to put a
period to their insolence: seeing he was favoured by the people, and back'd by several of the
principal Citizens; he communicated his designs with Benedetto Alberto, Tomaso Strozzi,
and Georgio Scali; all of them concurring in the Plot, and ingaging their assistance. Upon
this they form'd a Law privately, whereby the Ordini dlla Giustitia against the Grandees
were reviv'd, the authority of the Capitani di parte, retrench'd; and the Ammoniti re|admitted
to the Magistracy. And, because it was best to propose and enact it at one time,
if it were possible (for it was first to be presented to the Colledges, and afterwards deba|ted

in the Councils,) Salvestro being in his Office, (which, for the time, is, as it were, Prince
of the City) he caused a Colledge and Council to be called both together in one morning;
and coming in person to the Colledge, (which were none of his friends) he proposed the
Law to them which he had prepared; but it was rejected as an innovation, and he could
not prevail to have it pass'd. Salvestro, seeing himself defeated in his first practice to ob|tain
it, pretended some necessity to go forth; and, without being perceived slip'd away to
the Council; where, having placed himself so as he might be heard and seen by the whole
Assembly, he told them as follows:
That,The Speech of Salvestro de Medici. being made Gonfaloniere, he did not think he had been design'd for the Cogni|zans
and determination of private Causes, (which have their peculiar Iudges) but to
superintend the State, to correct the insolence of the Grandees, and to moderate and rectifie
such Laws as were found prejudicial, nay, destructive to the Common-wealth. That in
both cases he had been diligent to the utmost; and imployed himself with all possible in|dustry:
but the perversness and malevolence of some men was so untractable, and con|trary
to his good designs; they did not only hinder him from perpetrating any hing for
the benefit of the publick; but they denied him their Counsel, and refused for to bear
him. Wherefore, finding it was not in his power to be any way beneficial to his Country;
he knew not for what reason, or with what confidence he should continue in an Offic
which either he did not really deserve, or of which he was thought unworthy by others.
For this cause his intention was to retire and leave the people to the election of another,
who might be more vertuous, or more fortunate than he.
And having said, he departed from the Council towards his own house. Those of the
Council, who were privy to the design, and others, desirous of novelty, raised a tumult
thereupon; to which, the Senators and Colledges immediately resorted; and meeting their
Gonfaloniere, they prevailed with him, partly with their authority, and partly with their in|treaty,
to return to the Council, which, by that time, was in great confusion: many of the
Noble Citizens had been threatened, and injuriously treated; and, among the est, Carlo
Strozzi had been taken by the buttons, by an Artificer, and doubtlesly slain, had not the
standers-by interposed; and, with some difficulty, sav'd him. But he which made the
greatest hubub, and put the City in Arms, was Benedetto de gli Alberti, who, from a win|dow
of the Palace, cry'd out aloud to the people, to Arm; Upon which the Piazza was
fill'd with arm'd men immediately; and the Colledges did that out of fear, which they
had denied upon request. The Captains of the parties had, in the mean time, got toge|ther
what Citizens they could, to advise what was to be done against this Decree of the
Senate. But when they heard of the tumult, and understood what had passed in Council,
they all of them slunk back to their houses. Let no man that contrives any alteration in
a City, delude himself, or believe that he can either stop it when he will, or mannage it as
he pleases. Salvestro's intention was to have procur'd that Law, and setled the City. But
it fell out quite otherwise; for their humours being stir'd, every man was distracted: the
shops shut up; the Citizens assaulted in their houses: several remov'd their goods into the
Monestaries and Churches, to secure them; all people expecting some mischief at hand.
The whole Corporation of the Arts, met, and each of them made a Syndic. Hereupon the
Priori call'd their Colledges, and were in Counsel a whole day together with the Syndics, to
find out a way to compose their disorders to the satisfaction of all parties; but, being of
different judgments, nothing was agreed. The next day the Arts came forth with Ensigns
displaid; which the Senate understanding, and doubting what would follow, they call'd a
Counsel to prevent the worst, which was no sooner met but the tumult increased, and the
Ensigns of the Arts marched up into the Piazza with Colours flying, and store of arm'd
men at their heels. Thereupon to satisfie the Arts, and the multitude, and (if possible) to
dispel that cloud of mischief which was impending; the Council gave General power
(which,The Balia. in Florence is called Balia) to the Senators, Colledges, the Eight, the Captains of
the Parties, and the Syndics of the Arts, to reform the State as they should think most ad|vantagious
for the publick. Whilst these things were in agitation; some of the Ensigns of
the Arts, joyning themselves with some of the rabble, (being stimulated by certain persons,
who were desirous to revenge themselves of some late injuries which they had received from
the Guelfs) stole away from the rest; went to the Palace of Lapo da Castiglionchio, broke
into it, plunderd it, and burned it. Lapo, upon intelligence of what the Senate had done,
in contradiction to the orders of the Guelfs, and seeing the people in Arms, having no va|riety
of choice; but either to hide, or to fly; he absconded first in S. Croce, but afterwards
fled away to Casentino, in the disguise of a Frier; where he was often heard to complain of
himself, for having consented to Piero de gli Albizi: and of Piero for having protracted
their attempt upon the Government till S. Iohn's day. Piero and Carlo Strozzi, upon the

first noise of the tumult, hid themselves only, presuming (when it was over) they had re|lations
and friends enough to secure their residence in Florence. The Palace of Lapo being
burn'd, (mischiefs being more easily propagated, than begun,) several other houses ran the
same fate, either out of publick malice, or private revenge: and that the greediness and ra|pacity
of their Companions might, if possible out-do theirs; they broke up the Goals, and
set the prisoners at liberty: and, after this, they sack'd the Monastery of Agnoli and the
Convent di S. Spirito to which, many Citizens had convey'd much of their goods. Nor
had the publick Chamber escap'd their violence, had not the awe and reverence of one of
the Signori defended it; who being on horse-back, with some persons in Arms attending
him, opposed himself, in the best manner he could, against the fury of the people; which
being appeased in some measure, either by the authority of the Signori, or the approach of
the night, the next day the Balia indemnified the Ammoniti, with proviso, that for three
years,Reformati|on again. they should not exercise any Magistracy in that City. They rescinded those Laws
which were made in prejudice to the Guelfs. They proclaimed Lapo da Castiglionochio,
and his accomplices, Rebels: after which, new Senators were chosen, and of them, Luig
Guicciardini was made Gonfaloniere. Being all lookt upon as peaceable men, and lovers
of their Country great hopes were conceived the tumult would have ceased: notwithstand|ing,
the shops were not opened; the people stood to their Arms, and great Guards kept
all over the City: so that the Signori entred not upon the Magistracy abroad, with the usual
pomp, but privately within doors, and without any ceremony at all. These Senators con|cluded,
nothing was so necessary nor profitable for the publick, at the begining of their
Office, as to pacifie the tumult: whereupon, by Proclamation, they requir'd all Arms to be
laid down; all shops to be opened; and all persons, who had been call'd out of the Coun|try,
to the assistance of any Citizen, to depart. They disposed Guards in several places of
the Town; and ordered things so, that if the Ammoniti could have been contented, the
whole City would have been quiet. But they not being satisfied to attend three years be|fore
they should be capable of Office, the Arts, in favour to them, got together again; and
demanded of the Senate, that, for the future, no Citizen might be admonished as a Ghibilin,
by either the Senate, the Colledge, the Captains of the Parties, the Consuls, or Sindic's of
any Art whatsoever: requiring likewise, that new imborsation might be made of the Guelfs,
and the old one be burn'd. Their demands were presently accepted, both by the Senate
and Counsels; supposing thereupon, their new tumult would have ceased. But those that
are covetous, and impatient for revenge, are not to be satisfied with bare restitution. Such
as desired disorder, to inrich and wreck themselves upon their enemies, persuaded the Ar|tificers
they could never be safe, unless many of their adversaries were banished, ot destroy|ed.
Which practices being remonstrated to the Senate; they caused the Magistrates of the
Arts, and the Sindic's, to appear before them, to whom Luigi Guicciardini the Gonfaloniere
spake in this maner:
If these Lords,Luigi Guic|ciardini's Ora|tion. and my self, had not long since understood the fortune of this City;
and observed, that its Wars abroad were no sooner determined, but it was infested with
new troubles at home; we should have more admired, and more resented the tumults
Which have happened: but things that are familiar, carrying less terror along with them,
we have born the late passages; with more patience; especially, considering we were not
at all conscious to their beginning; and had reason to hope they would have the same
end as former tumults have had upon our condescension to their great, and their numerous
demands. But finding (to our Sorrow) you are so far from composing your thoughts, or
acquiescing in what has been granted, that you are rather exasperated, and conspire new in|jury
against your fellow Citizens, and endeavour to banish them; we must needs say, the ig|nobleness
of your proceedings provokes us to displeasure. And certainly, had we imagin'd,
that in the time of our Magistracy, our City should have been ruin'd, either in siding with,
or against you, we should have declin'd that honour, and freed our selves from it, either
by banishment, or flight. But, supposing we had to do with people not utterly destitute
of humanity, and void of all affection to their Country; we willingly accepted of the
preferment, as hoping, by the gentleness of our deportment, to be too hard for your am|bition
and violence. But we see now, by unhappy experience, the mildness of our beha|viour,
and the readiness of our condescensions do but inhanse and elate you, and spur
you on to more dishonourable demands. We say not this to disgust, but to inform you;
let others represent to you what will please; it shall be our way to remonstrate what is
profitable. Tell me (upon your words) what is there more that you can justly desire of
us? You proposed to have the Captains of the Parties devested of their authority; it
is done. Yov mov'd, the old imborsations might be burn'd, and new ones decreed to
supply them; we consented. You had a mind the Ammoniti should be re-admitted to

places of honour and trust; we granted it: Upon your intercession, we pardoned those
who had burned houses, and rob'd Churches; and, to satisfie you, have sent several of our
principal Citizens into Exile. To gratifie you, the Grandees are circumscrib'd with new
Laws, and all things done that might satisfie you: what end therefore will there be of
your demands? Or, how long will you abuse the liberty you enjoy? Do you not perceive,
that we can be overcome with more patience, then you can subdue us? What will be the
conclusion; or, whither will your dissentions hurry this poor City? Can you have for|got
how Castruccio, (an inconsiderable Citizen of Luca) taking advantage of the divi|sions,
possessed himself of it? Do not you still remember, that the Duke of Athens, from
a private person, became your Lord and your Sovereign; and all from our own differen|ces
at home? Whereas, when we were united, the Arch-Bishop of Millan, nor the Pope
himself, were able to hurt us; but were glad (after several years War) to lay down
with dishonour. Why then will you suffer your own discords (in time of Peace too) to
bring a City into slavery, which so many potent enemies, in time of War, were not able
to captivate? What can you expect from your divisions, but servitude? What from the
goods you have, or shall hereafter take violently from your neighbours, but poverty? The
persons you plunder, are they, who, by our care and appointment, supply the City
with all things; and if it be defeated of them, what can we do to sustain i? What-ever
you gain, (being unjustly acquir'd) you can hardly preserve: from whence, famine and
poverty must necessarily follow. These Lords therefore, and my self do command, and (if
it be consistent with our, Dignity) intreat, and beseech you, that you would compose
your selves for this once, and be content with our pass'd condescensions; or, if they be
too little, and there remains still something to be granted; that you would dsire it ci|villy,
and not with the force and clamour of a tumult; and if your request be just, you will
not only be gratified; but occasion taken away from wicked men, to ruine your Country,
under your shelter and pretence.
These words being true, had great influence upon the people, insomuch that they return'd
their thanks to the Gonfaloniere, acknowledged that he had behav'd himself like a good Lord
to them, and a good Citizen to the City, and promised their obedience to what-ever he com|manded.
To breake the ice, the Signori deputed two Citizens for each of the chiefest Of|fices,
to consult with the Syndic's of the Arts, what, in order to the publick good, was most
fit to be reformed; and to report it to the Senate. But, whilst these things were transacting,
a new tumult broke out, which put the City into more trouble than the former. The greatest
part of the robbery, and late mischief, was committed by the rabble, and rascallity of the
people; and of them; those who had been most eminently mischievous, apprehended, when
the greater differences were reconcil'd, they might be questioned, punished for the
crimes they had committed, and (as it always happens) be deserted by those very persons
who instigated them at first:New troubles to which was added, a certain hatred the inferior sort of the
people had taken against the richer Citizens, and the Principals of the Arts, upon pretence
that they were not rewarded for the service they had done, with proportion to their de|serts.
For when, as in the time of Charles the First, the City was divided into Arts, every
Art had its proper Head and Governour, to whose jurisdiction, (in Civil cases) every person
in the several Arts, were to be subject. These Arts (as we said before) were originally but
XII, afterwards they increased to XXI, and grew to that power and authority, that, in a few
years, they ingrossed the whole Government of the City: and because, among them, some
were more considerable, and some less; they came, by degrees, to be distinguished, and VII of
them were call'd Maggiori, and XIV, Minori. From this division, and the other reasons
aforesaid, proceeded the arrogance of the Captains of the Parties; for those Citizens who
had anciently been Guelfs, (under whose Government those Offices were always preserved)
did ever indulge the chief and better sort of the Arts; and discountenance the more infe|rior,
and all that took their parts: hence it was, all the before-mentioned troubles and tu|mults
were derived. But because, in the ordinary Companies and Corporations of the
Arts, there were many trades (in which the meaner sort of people were im|ployed)
of no distinct and peculiar Company, but were incorporated with other
Trades, as the quality of their imployments made them fit; it fell out, that when
they were not satisfied with their work, or any other ways injured by their Masters; they
had no person to repair to for redress, but to the Magistrate of that Company of which
they were sworn; from whom, they conceived, they had not received that justice, which
ought to have been done them. Of all Companies of the City, the Company of
Clothiers was the greatest, and had most of these sort of people depending upon it; inso|much,
that being the first in wealth and authority' by the industry of its Members, it main|tain'd
(and does still) the greatest part of the multitude. The baser sort of people there|fore

(both of this Company, and the rest) were highly incensed upon the foresaid occasi|ons;
and being excited, by fear of correction, for the pillaging and firing of the Palaces,
they met many times in the night, to discourse of what was pass'd; and to admonish one
another of the danger they were in; and to animate and unite them, one of the most dar|ing,
and most experienced among them, made this Speech:
Were it now to be considered,The Speech of a Plebeian. whether we were immediately to take Arms; to burn, and
plunder the houses of our fellow Citizens, and rob the Churches; I should be one of those who
should think it worthy of further debate, and perhaps, prefer harmless poverty before hazar|dous
gain. But, since Arms are taken, many mischiefs have been done; and much prize
has been got; it is (in my judgment) most natural, to advise which way our gains are to be
preserved; and how we may best secure our selves against the ills we have committed. I am
certainly of opinion, if no man should do you that service, your own necessity would advise
you. You see the whole City full of complaints, and indignation against us; the Citizens, fre|quent
in their meetings; and the Senators perpetually with the Magistrate. Be confident,
'tis to design against us; to contrive new ways, and to contract new Forces to destroy us.
It remains therefore upon us, to do two things; one is, to provide, that we be not punished for
our pass'd offences: the other, that we may live with more liberty and satisfaction for the
future. To justifie therefore our former misdeeds, in my thoughts, it is convenient to increase
them with new; and by the artifice of redoubling our mischiefs, our conflagrations, and rob|beries,
to allure and ingage more companions to our Party. For, where many are guilty,
none are punished; though small faults are revenged, great ones are generally rewarded; and
where the disease is epidemical, few people complain; an universal caamity being always
more supportable than a private. So then, to multiply our misdeeds, is the readiest way of
obtaining our pardon, and prevailing for those things which we believe conducive to our li|berty:
nor is there any difficulty to discourage us; it seems to me, the enterprise is not only ea|sie,
but certain; because those who should oppose us, are divided, and rich: their divisions
will give us the Victory; and their riches (when we have got them) shall maintain it. Let
not the antiquity of their blood dismay you, (though objected so insolently.) All men having
the same original, are equally ancient; and nature has made no difference in their contex|ture,
strip them naked, you are as well as they: dress them in your rags, and your selves
in their robes,, and you will doubtless be the Nobles; for 'tis nothing but poverty and
riches that discriminates betwixt you. It troubles me, to think, that there are many of you
unquiet in your consciences, for what you have done; and resolved to be guilty of no
more: if it be so, I was mistaken in my judgment, and you are not the persons I thought
you. Neither conscience, nor disgrace, ought at all to deterr you; they that overcome,
(let the means be what they will) are never troubled with the dishonour: and, for con|science,
you ought not to be concern'd. Where the fear of famine, and death, and pri|sons,
are so pregnant, there is no room for apprehensions of Hell. Observe the ways
and progress of the World; you will find the rich, the great, and the potent, arrive at
all that wealth, and grandeur, and authority, by violence or fraud; and when once they
are possessed, you will see with what confidence and security they gild over the brutality
of their usurpations, with the unjust (but glorius) title of acquests. Observe, on the
other side, those whose pusllanimity or sottishness affrights them from those courses, what
becomes of them? they are choak'd up and consumed in servitude and poverty: honest
servants, are perpetual servants; good men are always badly provided for; the bold and
unscrupulous, do soonest free themselves from bondage; and the most fraudulent and rapa|cious,
from indigence and distress. God and Nature have laid every mans fortune before
him; and we see men more naturally dispos'd to rapine, than industry; to bad actions,
than good. Hence it is, we devour one another; and he that can do least, goes always
by the worst. Force, therefore, is to be used, when occasion is given; and, what fairer
opportunity can be offered by Fortune? The Citizens are divided; the Senate irresolute;
the Magistrate frighted; so that before they can unite, and come to any resolution, our
work will be done, and we be either absolute Princes of the City, or Masters of such
Cantons, as will not only pardon us for what is pass'd, but inable us to awe our enemies
for the future. I confess, this resolution is dangerous, and bold; but where necessity ur|ges,
boldness is prudence; and danger in great things, was never considered by men of
the least courage and gallantry. Those enterprises which begin with danger, do end with
reward; and men never free themselves from one peril, but by adventuring a greater.
Again, having prisons, and tortures, and death before our eyes, (as we have) it cannot
but be more hazardous to stand still, than to look out for security: in the first, our destru|ction
is certain; in the other, contingent. How often have I heard you complain of
the avarice of your superiors; and the injustice of your Magistrates? Now, in your

time, not only to free, but to advance your selves into a capacity of retaliating, and giving
them as much occasion of fearing you, as you have had of them. Time has wings, op|portity
flies away; and when once pass'd, is never to be reclaim'd. You see our
enemies are preparing, let us prevent their preparation: who-ever begins first, is sure to
prevail, to the ruine of their enemies, and exaltation of themselves. Go on therefore
with courage, 'tis an enterprise will yield honour to many of us, but security to us
all.
Though their own propensity was too much, this speech push'd the people forward, with
more impetuosity, to mischief; so that after they had drawn together what company they
were able, they concluded to take Arms, and oblig'd themselves, by oath, to relieve one
another, when any of them should fall under the correction of the Magistrate. Whilst they
were in this manner conspiring against the Government, the Senators had notice of it from
one, and having caused one Simone to be apprehended, he confessed the whole plot, and
that the next day was intended for a tumult. whereupon, fore-seeing the danger they
were in, they assembled the Colledges, and such Citizens as sided with the Sindic's of the
Arts, and laboured the preservation of the City, Before they could be got together, it was
night; and the Signori were advised to consult with the Consoli dell' Arti, who agreed u|nanimously,
that the whole City should Arm; and the Gonfaloniere del Populo, draw all
the Companies, the next morning, into the Piazza. At the time when the Citizens met,
and Simone was upon the Rack, one Nicolada Friano being in the Palace, to do something
about the clock, returned with all speed to his house, put the whole neighbourhood into
an uproar, and brought above a thousand arm'd men together into the Piazza di Santo
Spirito in a moment. The alar'm increasing, came to the rest of the Conspirators, who
immediatly took Arms;The people rise again. and in a short space, San Piero Mggiore, and Sn Lorenza, (as
they had appointed before) were full of Arm'd men. The day being arriv'd, which was
the 21st. of Iuly, in favour of the Senate, there were not above 80 men appeared in their
Arms, and none of the Gonfaloniere; for they having intelligence the whole City was in
Arms, were affraid to stir out of their houses. The first party of the people which advan|ced
to the Piazza, was that which had met at San Piero Maggior; but the Forces which
were drawn there before, did not remove. Not long after them, appeared the rest of the
multitude, who, finding no resistance, with hideous noise, demanded their prisoners of the
Signori, and not succeeding by threats, to gain them by force, they set fire to the Palace of
Luigi Guicciardini, and burned it to the ground; whereupon, for fear o worse mischief,
their prisoners were ordered to be delivered. When they had recovered their prisoners,
they took the Standard della Giustitia from the Essecutore, burned many houses under it, and
persecuted all people that they were angry with, whether upon publick, or private account;
many Citizens, upon particular quarrels, conducting the tumult to the houses of their ad|versaries;
it being sufficient, to cry out in the multitude, To such an house, to such a man;
or for him that carried the Standard, to direct it to such a place. They burned the accounts
and books of the Company of the Clothing Trade; and after they had done mischief good
store, that they might accompany their exorbitance with some laudable action, they made
Salvestro de Medici, a Knight, and as many more of their Partners, as the whole number a|mounted
to 64, among which, there were Benedetto, and Antonio de gli Alberti; Tomazo
Strozzi, and several others; some of which, received their honour much against their wills.
In which accident, one thing is more then ordinarily remarkable; that those persons, some
of them, whose houses were burned; were, the same day, knighted by the same persons
which had burned them; so unconstant are the people, and so small the distance betwixt
their kindness, and revenge; an experiment of which, was seen in their behaviour to Luigi
Guicciardini, the Gonfaloniere della Giustitia. The Senators finding themselves abandoned
by their Guards, by the chief of the Arts, and their Gonfaloniere themselves, were very
much perplexed, no-body coming into their assistance, as they were commanded; and, of
the 16 Gonfaloni, there was only the Company of the Golden Lion, and two more, which
appeared, and they staid not long in the Piazza; for, not finding themselves followed by
their Brethren, they also returned to their houses: the Citizens, on the other side, see|ing
the fury of the multitude uncontroulable, and the Palace of the Signori de|serted,
some of them kept close in their houses; others thrust themselves into the crowd,
thereby to secure there own houses, and their friends; by which means, the numbers of
the people were much increased, and the power of the Senate extreamly diminished. The
tumult continued in this violence all day long; and, at night, there were above 6000 men to|gether
at the Palace of Stephano, behind the Church of S. Barnaby. Before day, they con|strained
the several Arts to send for their Ensigns; and having got them in the morning,
they march'd with their Colours before them, to the Palace of the Podesta, who re|fusing

to surrender; they fell upon it, and forced it. The Senate desirous to compose
things another way, perceiving nothing was to be done by force, called three Mem|bers
of their Colledges, and sent them to the Palace of the Podesta, who found, that
the heads of the people had been already in consultation with the Sindic's of the Arts, and
some other considerable Citizens, to resolve what was fit to be demanded of the Senate: so
that they returned in a short time to the Senate, with four Deputies from the people, and
these following proposals.The demands of the people. That the Clothing Trade might not, for the future, be subject
to the Government of a forreigner; That three new Companies, or Corporations, should
be erected; one, to consist of Carders, and Diers; another, of Barbers, Taylers, Shoo|makers,
and such other Mechanicks; and the third; of the more inferior Trades, out of
Which Companies, two should be chosen to sit in the Senate; and three to sit among the
14, which had the Government of the Artiminori, or inferiour Trades. That the Senate
should provide Halls for these new Companies, where they might meet, and consult a|bout
their affairs. That no person, of any of these Companies, should be constrained to
pay any debt under fifty Duckets, for the space of two years. That no interest should be paid
out of the Banks, and only the principal to be restor'd. That all prisoners, and condemn'd
persons, should be discharged. That all the Ammoniti should be re-admitted to all honours.
Many other things were demanded in behalf of their friends; and, on the contrary, as to
their enemies, they insisted, that several of them might be imprisoned, and several ad|monished.
To give perfection to all, it was necessary they should be ratified in the Counsel
of the Commons; which was deferred till the next, because two Counsels were not to be
held in one day. In the mean time, the Arts seemed all of them to be content, and the
people to be satisfied; having promised, as soon as their Laws and demands were confirm|ed,
they would retire to their houses. The next morning being come, and the Counsel
of the Commons deliberating upon their demands; the voluble and impatient multitude
were got together, and marching, with Ensigns displaid, into the Piazza, with so obstre|perous
and dreadful a noise, as affrighted both the Counsel, and Senate: whereupon, Guer|riante
Marignouli, one of the Signori, (induced more by fear, than any private exception)
went down, under pretence to secure the Gate below, and march'd off to his house. He
could not, however, convey himself so privatly away, but the Rabble discovered him, yet
without any violence to him, only crying out, as he passed, that all the Senators should leave
the Palace; if not, they would burn their houses, and knock their children on the head.
By this time, the Law they urg'd, was concluded; the Senators returned to their Cham|bers;
and the Counsel gone down, (not daring to go forth) were walking up and down
the Court and the Cloysters, dispairing of the safety of the City, by reason of the bruitish|ness,
and barbarity of the multitude, and the crossness or pusillanimity of those who might
have either bridled or suppressed them. The Signori were likewise in no less doubt and
confusion, seeing themselves not only forsaken by one of their own Members, but relieved
by no-body, neither with intelligence, norsupplies. Whilst they were in this hesitation,
uncertain what they ought, or what they were able to do, Tomazzo Strozzi, and Benedetto
Alberti, (prompted by private ambition, of being themselves the last of the Senators which
should remain in the Palace, or else, because it was really their judgment) persuaded them
to give way, to yield to the fury of the people, and retire privatly, every man to his own
house. This counsel being given by persons who had been heads of the people, (though
others seem to approve it) displeased Alamanno Acciaivoli, and Nicolo de Bene, exceed|ingly,
who (recollecting their courage) made answer; That, if others of the Senate had a
mind to depart, they would not hinder them; but, for their parts, till the expiration of
their authority permitted them, they were resolved not to leave the Palace, but with the
loss of their lives. This difference redoubled the horror of the Senate, and the rage of the
people: insomuch, that the Gonfaloniere, choosing to resign his Office with shame, rather
than retain it with danger, recommended himself to Tomazzo Strozzi's protection, who
took him out of the Palace, and conducted him to his house: in like manner, the rest of
the Signori departed one after another; and Alamanno, and Nicolo, (who were so magna|nimous
before, lest they should be thought more valiant than wise, got out also, and re|turned
like the rest; so that the Palace, remained in the hands of the people, and the eight
Officers for the administrations of War, who had not as yet laid down their Commands.
When the people made their entrance into the Palace,Michaele di Lando. the Ensigns of the Gonfaloniere di
Giustitia, was carried by one Michaele di Lando, a Carder of Wooll. This Michaele
(without shoes on his feet, and scarce cloathes on his back) being followed by a great rout,
ran up to the top of the stairs, and being got within hearing of the place where the Sena|tors
sate, he turned himself about to the multitude, and said; You see, Gentlemen, this Pa|lace,
and this City, is yours; how shall they be disposed of, or, what is your pleasure shall be done?

To which, they universally replyed, it was their pleasure he should be Gonfaloniere, and
govern the City as he thought best. Michaele accepted the Office, being a prudent and
sagacious man, more obliged to Nature than Fortune; and the first thing he resolved,
was, to compose the tumults, and settle the City. To hold the people imployed, and gain
time for the digestion of his designs, he commanded them abroad, in search of one Ser Nuto,
(who had been intended for Provost Marshal, by Lapo da Castiglionochio, and most of those
who were about him, went away in his pursuit. To begin (then) his dominion with ju|stice,
as he had acquired it by Grace, he caused Proclamation to be made, that no man
should dare to burn, or steal any thing for the future; and to terrifie the more, he caused
a Gallows to be set up in the Piazza: proceeding next to the reformation of the City, he
turned out the Sindic's of the Arts, and put new in their places; He deprived the Signori,
and the Colledges of their Authority, and burned the bags of their Office. By this time
the people had found Ser Nuto, brought him to the Palace, tyed him up to the Gallows by
one of his legs, and every one that was about him, having torn off a peice, in a moments
time, there was nothing of him to be seen, but one of his feet. On the other side, the Otto
della Guerra, (supposing the Government in them, upon the departure of the Signori) had
designed new Senators to succeed them. But Michaele understanding it, sent to them to
be gone out of the Palace, and to let them know, it should appear to all people, that he
could govern Florence, without their counsel or assistance. After this, he assembled the
Sindic's of the Arts; and created four new Senators out of the inferior sort of people;
two for the better, and two for the worser Trades. Moreover, he divided the State into
three parts,; one of them to relate to the new Arts; another to the less; and the third to
the greater. He gave to Salvestro de Medici, the revenue of the shops upon the old Bridge;
to himself, the Podestaria of Empoli; besides many other Acts of beneficence to several Ci|tizens,
and friends of the people, not so much for their own sakes, but that they might be
always willing, and able to defend him. The people however, began to suspect, that Mi|chaele
was partial to the better sort; and to discern that they had not so much interest in the
Government, as would be necessary for their safety. Whereupon, push'd forward by their
accustomed insolence, they took Arms again, and came marching, with their Colours flying,
to the Piazza, in a bravado, requiring the Senators to come down to the Ringheria, and
deliberate upon certain new things they had to propose for their security, and good. Mi|chaele
was sensible of their insolence, but (not to provoke them any farther, before he knew
what they would have) he only blamed their manner of address; desired them to lay down
their Arms, and, that then, by fair means, they should obtain that, which did not stand
with the Dignity of the Government to grant by constraint: with which answer, the peo|ple
being highly incensed, they drew up at new S. Maries, against the Palace, and created
eight Commissioners, with their Ministers and dependants, to gain themselves reverence
and reputation: so, as at that time, the City had two Tribunals; and were governed by
two distinct Administrations. Among the Commissioners it was resolv'd, that eight per|sons,
to be chosen by the body of the Arts, should be always resident in the Palace, with
the Senators, to give Sanction to what-ever the Signori resolv'd upon. They took from
Salvestro de Medici, and Michaele de Lando, what-ever in their former Counsels they had
conferred upon them; assigning several Offices, and pensions, to many of their friends, to
support the Dignity of their imployments. Having concluded, in this manner, among
themselves, to make all the more valid, they sent two of their Members to the Senate, to
demand their confirmation; otherwise, to let them know, that what they could not ob|tain
by civil application, they were able to do by force. These two Commissioners de|livered
their message to the Senate, with great confidence and presumption; upbraiding
the Gonfaloniere by his Office, and other honours which he had received from them; and
that, in return, he had most ungratefully behav'd himself towards them and coming, at
the end of their objurgation, to threaten him; Michaele, unable to indure so great inso|lence,
(more sutably to the Majesty of his Place, than the meaness of his Birth) resolved
by some extraordinary way, to correct such extraordinary impudence, and drawing his
sword, he cut them very much, and caused them afterwards, to be manacled and imprisoned.
This action of the Gonfaloniere was no sooner known, but it put all the multitude in a
flame: and believing they should be able to gain that by violence, which they could not
compass without, they immediately to their Arms, and march'd round about the Palace, to
find where, with most advantage, they might fall on. Michaele, on the otherside, suspe|cting
the worst, resolved to be before-hand, as judging it more honourable to fall upon
them abroad, than to expect them within the walls, till they fell upon him, and forced him
out of the Palace (as they had done his Predecessors) with great shame and dishonour.
Gathering therefore together a great number of Citizens, (who having found their error)

were resorted to him; he marched out as strong as he could, on horse-back, and advanced
to fight them as far as new S. Maries.
The people (as I said before) were as forward as he; and marching about towards the
Palace, to take their advantage, it happened, Michaele made his sally at the same time,
and they missed one another.Michaele o|vercomes the multitude. Michaele returning, found the people had possessed them|selves
of the Piazza, and were storming the Palace; whereupon, he charged them so
smartly on the rear, that he brake them immediately; some of them he chaced out of the
City; and forced the rest to throw down their Arms, and hide themselves. This victory
being obtained, the tumult dissolved, and the City became quiet, and all by the single va|lour
of the Gonfaloniere; who for Courage, Generosity, and Prudence, was superiour to any
Citizen of his time, and deserves to be numbered among the few Benefactors to their Coun|try:
for, had he been ambitious, or ill-disposed, the City had lost its liberty, and relapsed in|to
greater tyranny than that in the time of the Duke of Athens. But, his goodness would
not admit a thought against the good of the publick; and his prudence managed things so,
that many submitted to him, and the rest he was able to subdue.
These passages amazed the common people, and put the better sort of Artificers into an
admiration of their own stupidity, who could not endure the grandeur of the Nobility, were
now forced to truckle to the very skum of the people. When Michaele had this good for|tune
against the people, at the same time, new Senators were drawn, two of which were of
so vile and abject condition, every body desired to quit themselves of so infamous a Ma|gistracy.
Whereupon, the first day of September, when the Signori made the first entrance
upon their Office, the people being so thick, that the Palaci was full of arm'd men; there
was a cry sent forth from among them, that no Senator should be made out of the meaner
sort of the people; and, in satisfaction to them, the Senate degraded the other two, (one of
which was called Tira, and the other Boraccio) and, in their places, Georgio Scali, and Fran|cesco
di Michaele, were elected.
Afterwards, they dissolved the Corporations of the meaner Trades, and of all their de|pendants;
only Michaele di Lando, Ludovico di Puccio, and some few other were excepted.
They divided the Magistracy into two parts; one for the greater, the other for the lesser
sort of Arts. Only it was concluded, the Senate should contain five of the lesser Arts, and
four of the greater; the Gonfaloniere to be chosen sometimes out of one, and sometimes out
of the other. This Constitution and Establishment, setled the City for a while: and, al|though
the Government was taken out of the hands of the people; yet, the Artificers of
the meanest quality, had more power than the popular Nobility, who were forced to com|ply,
to satisfie the Arts, and divide them from the baser sort of people. This was much
approved by those who desired the faction of the Guelfs (which had handled several of the
Citizens with so great violence) might be depressed; among the rest which were ad|vanced by this new model, Giorgio Scali, Benedetto Alberti, Salvestro de Medici, and Tomaso
Strozzi were made,The popular Faction distin|guished from the plebean. as it were, Princes of the City. These proceedings exasperated the
jealousies betwixt the popular Nobility, and the meaner sort of people, by the instigation of
the Ricci, and Albizi, of which two parties, because we shall have frequent occasion to
discourse (many sad and great actions happening afterwards betwixt them) we shall, for
better distinction, call one of them the Popular, and the other the Plebeian Party, for the
future.
This Government continued three years, with frequent examples both of banishment
and death: for those who were at the helm, knowing there were many male-contents both
within the City, and without, lived in perpetual fear. They who were discontented
within, attempted, or conspired every day something or other against the State. Those
without, (having no restraint upon them) by means sometimes of this Prince, sometimes
of this Common-wealth, raised several scandals both of the one side and the other. At
that time, Giannozzo da Salerno, General for Carlo Durazzo, who was descended from
the King of Naples, happened to be at Bologna, attending a design, which; they said,
Durazzo had undertaken against Queen Giovanna, at the instigation of the Pope, who
was her mortal enemy. There were in Bologna, at the same time, several Exiles from
Florence, who held strict intelligence both with Pope Urban and Carle: which was the
cause, that those who governed in Florence, living in great jealousie, gave credit easily to
the calumniations of all those Citizens that were suspected. During this general apprehen|sion,
news was brought to the Magistrate, that Gionnozza da Salerno, with the assistance of
all those who were banished, was to march down with his Army against Florence; and
that several in the City had ingaged to take Arms in his behalf, and to deliver up the
Town. Upon this information, many were accused; in the first place, Piero de gli Albizi,
and Carlo Strozzi were named; and after them, Capriano Mangioni, Iacopo Sacchetti, Do|nato

Barbadori, Philippo Strozzi, and Giovanni Anselmi; all which were secured, except
Carlo Srozzi, who escaped; and (that no-body might dare to take Arms for their rescue)
the Senate deputed Tomaso Srozzi, and Benedetto Alberti, with a competent number of
Souldiers, to secure the City. The Prisoners being examined, and their charge, and an|swer
compared, they were found, not Guilty, and the Captain refused to condemn them;
hereupon those who were their enemies, incensed the people so highly against them, that, in
a great fury, they forced the Captain to condemn them. Neither could Piero de gli Albizi be
excused, either for the greatness of his Family, or the antiquity of his Reputation; he ha|ving
a long time been the most feared, and the most reverenced Citizen in Florence. Where|upon,
either some of his true friends, (to teach him moderation in the time of his great|ness,)
or some of his enemies, (to check, and alar'm him with the unconstancy of fortune)
at a great Treat which he had made for several of the Citizens, sent him a salver of Com|fits;
among which a nail was privately conveyed; which being discovered in the dish, and
viewed by the whole Table, it was interpreted as an admonishment to him, to fix the wheel
of his fortune; for being now at the height, if its rotation continued, he must of neces|sity
fall to the ground; which interpretation was verified first by his fall, and then by his
death. After this execution the City remained full of confusion, both Conquerors and
Conquered being affraid: but the saddest effects proceeded from the jealousie of the Go|vernors,
every little accident provoking them to new injuries against the Citizens, by con|demning,
admonishing, or banishing them the Town; to which may be added, the many
new Laws and Ordinances which they made to fortifie their authority; which were ex|ecuted
with great prejudice to all such as were suspected by their party: for, by them, 66
were commissioned, with the assistance of the Senate, to purge the Common-wealth of such
people as they thought dangerous to the State. These Commissioners admonished 39 Ci|tizens;
several of the Populace; and debased many of the Nobles; and to oppose them|selves
more effectually against foreign invasions, they entertained into their pay an English
man, called Iohn Aguto, and excellent Officer, and one who had commanded in Italy for
the Pope, and other Princes, a long time. Their alarms from abroad were caused by intel|ligence,
that Carlo Durazzo was raising several Companies for the invasion of the King|dom
of Naples; and the Florentine Exiles joyned with him in the Expedition; but to
obviate that danger, they provided not only what force, but what mony was possible;
and when Carlo came with his Army to Arrezzo, the Florentines being ready with fourty
thousand Florines to receive him, he promised he would not molest them. After he had
received their money, he proceeded in his enterprise against Naples; and having taken the
Queen, he sent her Prisoner into Hungary. His Victory there, suggested new jealousie in|to
the Governors of Florence: they could not imagine their money could have greater in|fluence
upon the King, than the friendship his Family had long maintained with the Faction
of the Guelfs, who were undone by him. Apprehensions increasing at this rate, enor|mities
increased with them, which were so far from extinguishing their fears, that they were
exceedingly multiplied; and the greater part of the City were in great discontent. To
make things worse, the insolence of Giargio Scali, and Tomaso Strozzi were added, who
being grown more powerful than the Magistrate, every one feared, lest, by their conjun|ction
with the Plebeians, they should be ruined.
Nor did this Government seem violent and tyrannical to good men only, but to the se|ditious,
and debauched: for this arrogance of Giorgio's being some time or other of ne|cessity
to have an end; it happened, that Giovanni di Cambio was accused by one of his
acquaintance, for practising against the State; but upon examination, Cambio was
found innocent by the Captain; and the Judge gave sentence, that the Informer should
suffer the same punishment, which should have been inflicted on the other, had his charge
been made good. Giorgio interposed, with his intreaties and authority to preserve him;
but, not prevailing, he, and Tomaso Strozzi, with a number of arm'd men, rescued him by
force, plundered the Captains Palace, and forced him to hide himself. This action made
the whole City detest him; put his enemies upon contriving his destruction, and Plotting
which way they might redeem the City out of his hands, and the Plebeians, (who, for
three years together, had had the command of it.)
To this design, the Captain gave the opportunity; for the tumult being appeased, he
went to the Senate, and told them;
That he had chearfully accepted the Office, to which they had elected him, presuming
he had served Persons of Honour and Equity, who would have taken Arms to have pro|moted
and vindicated Iustice, rather than to have obstructed it: but his observation
and experience had acquainted him with the Governors of the City and their manner
of conversation; that dignity which so willingly he had taken up for the benefit of his

Country, to avert the danger and detriment impending, he was as ready to lay down.
The Captain was sweetned by the Senate, and much confirmed by a promise made to
him of reparation for what he had suffered already, and security for the future. Here|upon,
several of them consulting with such of the Citizens as they thought greatest lovers
of their Country, and least suspicious to the state; it was concluded that they had now a
fair opportunity to redeem the City of the clutches of Giorgio and his Plebeians; (most
people having alienated their affections from him, upon his last insolence) and the best way
would be to improve it before they had time to reconcile; for they knew the favour of the
people was to be lost and gained by the least accident in the World.
For the better conduct of their affairs, it was thought necessary that Benedetto Alberti
should be drawn into the Plot; without whose concurrence, the enterprize would be dan|gerous.
This Benedetto was a very rich man, courteous, sober, a true lover of his Coun|try,
and one infinitely dissatisfied with the irregularity of their ways; so that it was no
hard matter to persuade him to any thing that might contribute to the ruine of Giorgio;
for that which had made him before an enemy to the Popular Nobility, and the faction of
the Guelfs, was the insolence of the one, and the tyranny of the other,; and afterwards
finding the heads of the multitude no better than they, he forsook them likewise, and all
the misdemeanors and impieties which were committed after that, were done without his
approbation or consent; so that the same reasons which inclined him to the people at first,
the same reasons impelled him now to desert them.
Having brought Benedetto and the heads of the Arts to their Lure in this man|ner,
and furnished themselves with Arms, they seized upon Giorgio, but Tomaso esca|ped.
The next day after he was apprehended, Giorgio was beheaded, with so great ter|ror
and consternation to his party, that they were so far from endeavouring his rescue, that
all of them crowded in to behold his execution. Being brought to die before those people
who had so lately adored him, he complained of the iniquity of his fortune, and the malig|nity
of those Citizens, who, by their injury and justice had constrained him to side with a
multitude which was not capable either of gratitude or fidelity; and discovering Benedetto
in the midst of the Guards, he said; And can you, Benedetto, consent that this wrong should be
done to me? Were you in my place, I assure you, I would not suffer it: but let me tell you, this
day is the last of my misfortunes, and the first of yours. After which, lamenting his un|happiness
in having committed his fortunes and life to the constancy of the people, which
is shaken by every rumor, or accident, or conceit, he laid down his head, and it was cut off
in the midst of his armed and insulting enemies: after him several of his confederates
were executed, and their bodies dragged about the streets by the people. His death put
the whole City into commotion; for at his execution, many Citizens had put themselves
into Arms in favour of the Senators, and the Captain of the people, and some upon the
dictates of their own private ambition and revenge. The City being full of various hu|mors,
every one had his private design, which all desired to compass before they laid down
their arms. The ancient Nobility called Grandi, could not brook that they were deprived
of publick imployments, and therefore set all their wits upon the tenters, to recover what
they had lost; and arm'd, upon pretence of re-investing the Captains of the Arts with
their original authority. The popular Nobility and the greater Arts were disgusted, that
the Government should be communicated to the inferior Arts, and the lowest sort of the
people. On the other side, the inferior Arts were disposed to augment, not detract from
their authority; and the meaner sort of people were as tender and jealous of loosing their
Colledges: which distractions caused the City to tumultuate several times in one year;
sometimes the Nobility; sometimes the better Trades; sometimes the lesser; sometimes
the common people; and sometimes altogether betaking to their Arms in several parts of
the Town; upon which, many skirmishes and rencounters happened betwixt them and
the Guards of the Palace; the Senators contending sometimes, and sometimes complying,
as they judged most likely to remedy those inconveniences: so that after two Treaties, and
several Balia's created for the reformation of the City; after many mischiefs, and troubles,
and dangers, they came to an agreement, That all who had been imprisoned after Salvestro
de Medici was made Gonfaloniere, should be discharged. That all dignities and pensions
conferred by the Balia LXXVIII should be taken away. That their honours should be
restored to the Guelfs. That the two new Arts should be deprived of their Incorporation
and Governors,Reformation and all their members and dependents disposed into the old Companies as
formerly. That the Gonfaloniere di Giustitia should not be elected by the lesser Arts; and
whereas before they had the disposition of half, they should hereafter be capable but of a
third part of the Offices of the City, and the best of them too to be put out of their
power: so that the popular Nobility and the Guelfs reassumed the whole Gvernment

and the Commons were absolutely dispossessed, after they had held it from the year 1378,
to 1381.The Com|mons expell'd from the Go|vernment. 1381. Michaele Lando impri|soned. Nor was this Magistracy less injurious towards the Citizens, nor less grievous in
its principles, than the Government of the people; many of the popular Nobility, who
had been eminent defenders of the people interest, being clap'd in prison, with great num|bers
of the chief of the Plebeians: Among which Michaele Lando was one; nor could the
many good Offices which he had done in the time of his authority, protect him from the
rage of that parry, when the licentious and unrestrained multitude ruined the City: so
little was his Country thankful for all his great actions. Into which error, because many
Princes and Common-wealths do frequently fall, it happens, that men terrified by such ex|amples,
before they can be made sensible of their Princes ingratitude, do fall into their dis|pleasure.
These slaughters and these exilements had always, and did then displease Bene|detto
Alberti; and he both publickly and privately condemn'd them. Whereupon, the
Government were fearful of him, as believing him one of the Plebeians principal friends, and
one who had consented to the death of Giorgio Scali, not out of any disapprobation of his
conduct, but that he might remain alone in authority after him. By degrees, his words
and demeanor came to be suspicious, and the party that was uppermost watch'd him very
narrowly, to find out some occasion to send him after Giorgio. Things being in this po|sture
at home, no great action happened abroad; that little which did happen, was occa|sioned
more by fear of what they might, than from any prejudice that was actually sustain'd;
Lodovico d' Angio coming into Italy about that time, to drive Carlo Durazzo out of the
Kingdom of Naples, and repossess the Queen Giovanna. The passage of this Prince put
the Florentines into no little distraction; Carlo, upon the old score of amity, desired their
assistance; Lodovico (like those who seek new friendships) demanded their neutrality. The
Florentines, (that they might please both parties, if possible) to comply with Lodovico, and
supply Carlo, discharged Aguto from their service, and recommended him to Pope Ur|ban,
who was a professed enemy to Carlo; which artifice was easily discovered by Lodovico,
and he thought himself much injured thereby. While the War continued in Puglia be|twixt
Lodovic and Charles, supplies were sent out of France to reinforce Lodovico: which
Forces (being arrived in Tuscany) were conducted to Arezzo by those who were banished
out of that Town, where they removed all those who were of Charles his party; and just
as they design'd the same measures against Florence,Lodovic's death. as they had taken against Arezzo, Lo|dovic
died, and the affairs of Puglia and Tuscany followed his fate, for Charles secur'd him|self
of his Kingdom, which he thought he had lost; and the Florentines, who were not
sure to defend their own, bought Arezzo of those who had kept it for Lodovic. Charles
having secured himself of Puglia, departed for Hungaria, (which Kingdom was, by inheri|tance,
descended to him) leaving his Wife behind him in Puglia, with Ladislao and Giovan|na,
(two of his children,) as shall be shewn more fully.
Carlo possessed himself of Hungary,Carlo d' An|gio's death. but died shortly after; hower his Conquest of that
Country was so grateful an exploit to the Florentines, that never greater expressions of
joy were made for any victory of their own, as appeared as well by publick as private mag|nificence;
many Families keeping open houses, and feasting exceedingly, but none with
that pomp and extravagance as the Family of the Alberti;Magnificenc envied. the provision and ostentation of
whose entertainments, were fitter for the condition of a Prince, than for a private person.
Which extravagance gained him much envy, and that, being seconded by a jealousie in the
Government, that Benedetto had designs against it, was the occasion of its destruction: for
they could not be safe, whilst they thought it might fall out every day, that he (reconciling
himself with the people) might turn them out of the City as he pleased. Things being
at this uncertainty, it happened that he being Gonfaloniere delle Compagnie, his Son in Law
Philippo Magalotti was made Gonfaloniere di Giustitia, which accident redoubled the appre|hension
of the Governors, as thinking Benedetto grew upon them so fast, their authority
must of necessity decline: but desirous to remedy it what they could, and if possible, with|out
a tumult, they encouraged Bese Magalotte (his enemy and competitor) to acquaint the
Senate, that Philippo not being of age for the execution of that Office, he could not, nor
ought not enjoy it; and the cause being heard in the Senate, Philippo was adjudged incapa|ble
of that Dignity, and Bardo Mancini succeeded in his place; a person fiercely against
the faction of the people, and a perfect enemy to Benedetto. Having entred upon his Of|fice,
he called a Balia for reformation of the State; which Balia inprisoned Benedetto Al|berti,
and banished all the rest of his Family, only Antonio was excepted. Before he was
carried away, Benedetto called all his friends together, to take his leave of them; and finding
them sad, and the tears in their eyes, he spake to them as follows:
You see (Gentlemen) in what manner fortune has ruin'd me,Benedetto's Speech and threatned you: I do
not wonder at it, nor indeed ought it to be strange to you: seeing it so happens always to

them, who, among ill men, are studious of being good, or sollicitous of sustaining that
which all people are desirous to pull down. The love to my Country associated me first
with Salvestro de Medici; and the same love divided me afterwards from Giorgio Scali:
it is nothing but that, and the injustice of their proceedings, which have made me hate
those who are now at the Stern; who, as they have had no-body that could punish them,
so they are desirous to leave no-body to reprehend them. I am content with my banish|ment,
to free them of the fear they have conceived not only of me, but of all that are
sensible of their Tyranny and injustice. For my self I am not so much concern'd; the honours
conferred upon me when my Country was free, I can quietly relinquish whilst it is in servi|tude
and bondage; and the memory of my past condition will give me more pleasure, than
the infelicity of my present can give me regret. My greatest affliction will be, to consider,
my Country is become a prey to particular men, and exposed to their insolence and rapine:
it troubles me likewise for you, lest those evils which this day are consummated in me, and
but commencing in you, should prove greater detriment to you than they have done to
me; however, comfort your selves, bear up against any misfortune, and carry your selves so;
that if things happen adversly, (as doubtless they will) it may appear to all people that
you were innocent, and that they succeeded without the least fault or contribution of
yours.
Afterwards,Benedetto dies at Rhodes. to give as great testimony of his virtue abroad, as he had done at home, he
went to the Sepulchre of our Saviour, and, in his return back, died at Rhodes. His bones
were brought back to Florence, and buried with great solemnity by those very people who
pursued him, whilst he was living, with all the calumny and injustice imaginable: nor were
the Alberti the only sufferers in these distractions, many Families beside that, were admonish|ed,
and imprisoned. Among the rest there were Piero Benini, Matteo Alderotti, Giovanni
e Francesco del Bene, Giovanni Benchi, Andrea Adimari, and with them several of the
lesser Artificers. Among them which were admonished, were the Covoni, the Benini, the
Rinucoi, the Formiconi, the Corbizi, the Manelli, and the Alderotti. The Balia was by custom
created for a precise time; and being now in the execution of these Citizens, who were fairly
elected; having done what they could for the satisfaction of the State, they desired to lay
down, though their time was not critically expir'd; which the people understanding, many
of them ran with their Arms to the Palace, crying out there were several more to be ad|monished,
and several more to be imprisoned before they renounced. The Senate was
much displeased, but entertained them with fair promises, till they had fortified themselves
so, as they were able to make them lay by those Arms, for fear, which in their rage they had
taken up: nevertheless, to comply in some proportion with the fierceness of the humour,
and lessen the Authority of the Plebeian Artificers; it was ordered, that whereas the third
part of the Offices of the City were in their hands before, they should now be reduced to a
fourth part only: and (that there might always be two of the most trusty and faithful
persons to the State, in the Senate) authority was given to the Gonfaloniere di Giustitia, and
four other Citizens, to put a certain number of select mens names into a purse, out of which,
at every meeting of the Senate, two were to be drawn.
Affairs thus setled in the year 1381, the City continued quiet within till 1393; in which
year Giovan Galeazzo Visconti (called the Comte di Vertu) took his Uncle Barnabo prisoner,1381.
and made himself, by that, Master of all Lombardy. This Comte di Vertu had an opinion
he could make himself King of Italy by force, as easily as he had made himself Duke of
Milan by fraud; so that in the year 1390 he began a War upon the Florentines, which,
though prosecuted with variety of fortune on both sides, yet the Duke was many times in
danger to have ruined Florence; and doubtless had ruined it, had not it been prevented by
his death. However, their defence was couragious, as might be expected from a Republick;
and the end of the War less unhappy, than the course of it had been dreadful; for when
the Duke had taken Bologna, Pisa, Perugia and Siena, and prepared a Crown, to be crowned
King of Italy in Florence, he died in the nick, and his death permitted him not to taste the
pleasures of his past Victories, nor the Florentines to feel the calamities which would have
followed their losses. Whilst this War with the Duke was on foot, Maso de gli Albizi was
made Gonfaloniere di Giustitia, who, upon Piero's death, was become a great enemy to the
Alberti: and (because in all Factions, the humour and animosity does still ferment and in|crease)
Maso (though Benedetto was dead in his banishment) had an itching desire, before he
laid down his Office, to be revenged of that Family, and he took his opportunity
upon the examination of a certain person who impeach'd Alberto, and Andrea de gli Al|berti
of intelligence with the Rebels. Upon this accusation they were immediately taken
into custody, and the whole frame of the City altered. The Senate took Arms, assembled
the people, created a Balia, by authority of which many Citizens were confined, and new

imborsation of Officers made: most of the Alberti were confined; many Artificers admo|nished,
and put to death. Upon which provocation, the Arts and inferior sort of people
took Arms, in as much heat as if their lives or reputation had been taken from them. Part
of them ran to the Piazza, and part to the house of Veri de Medici, who, after the death
of Salvestro, was become the head of that Family. To cajole those who were in the Mar|ket
place, the Senate sent Rinaldo Gianfigliazzi, and Donato Acciaivoli (as persons more
acceptable to the people than any else) to command them, and sent with them the Ensign of
the Guelfs, and the people. Those who went to the house of Veri, begg'd of him to take
the Government upon him, and free them from the Tyranny of those Citizens who were
enemies to every thing that was good. All those who have left any memorials of the passa|ges
of those times, do agree in this; That, had not Veri been more vertuous than ambiti|ous,
he might have made himself Prince of the City, without any impediment: for the
great damages justly and unjustly sustained by the Arts and their friends had so incensed
them, that there wanted nothing but an head, to satiate their revenge. Nor was Veri with|out
those that minded him of his advantage; for Antonio de Medici (who had long time
born him a grudge) persuaded him very earnestly to take the Government upon him; to
whom Veri returned this Answer.
As your threats, when you were mine enemy, did never affright me; so your Counsels
now you are my friend, shall never delude me.
And, turning about to the multitude, he bid them be couragious, for he would secure
them, if they would follow his direction. Then, marching in the midst of them into the
Piazza, he went up to the Senate, and told them;
That he could not be sorry his conversation had been such,Veri de Me|dici's Speech to the Senate. as had procured him the love of
the people; but yet he was much troubled they had made a wrong judgment of him, not at all
utable to what his conversation had deserved; for, never having given the least example
of ambition, or faction, he could not but wonder from whence they should deduce their opini|on;
that, as a turbulent person, he would be the maintainer of their factions, and, as an
ambitious man, the Governor of their State. He begg'd of their Lordships, that the error
of the multitude might not be imputed to him; for what ever was in his power, he submitted
to them, with the first opportunity; he recommended it to them to use their fortune temperate|ly,
and content themselves quietly with an imperfect victory, rather than to make it intire by
the destruction of the whole City.
Veri was much applauded by the Senate; they desired that he would be a means that all
Arms might be laid down, and that afterwards they would not fail to do what he and the
other Citizens should advise. After his harangue in the Senate, Veri returned into the
Piazza, and having joyned his Brigade with those under the Command of Rinaldo and
Donato, he gave this account to them all; That he found the Signori very well disposed to|wards
them: that many things had been proposed, but the shortness of the time, and the
absence of the Magistrates had prevented any conclusion; wherefore he made it his request
to them, that they would lay aside their Arms, and give obedience to the Senate, assuring
them, that with the Senate, gentleness would prevail farther then insolence, and entreaty
than threatning; and that they should want neither security nor preferment, if they would
be directed by him: upon which assurance they all returned to their houses. Arms being
in this manner laid down, the Senate secured the Palace with their Guards; then they listed
2000 Citizens which were best affected to the State, and divided them equally by Compa|nies,
with orders to be ready to relieve them when-ever they were called: the rest which
were not listed, were not suffered to bear Arms. These preparations being made, they im|prisoned
many of the Artificers, and put several of them to death who had been most prag|matical
in the late commotions; and, to add more Majesty and reputation to the Gonfaloniere
della Guistitia,
it was provided that no person should be capable of that Office under 45
years of age: to secure their Government, they made several other Laws and Ordinances
which were in supportable, not only to the persons against whom they were made, but even
to those who were honest, aud of their own party; for they could not believe a State well
grounded, or safe, that was to be defended with so much violence and severity. Nor were
the Alberti which remained in the City, the only persons dissatisfied with these proceedings;
nor the Medici (who look'd upon the people as meerly over-reach'd) many others were
with this extravagant severity exceedingly disgusted. The first man that opposed them,
was Donato the son of Acciaivoli. This Donato though he was one of the Grandees of
the City, and rather superior, than equal to Maso de gli Albizi, (who, for service done in
his Gonfaloniership, was become, as it were, Master of the City) yet, among so many male-contents,
it was impossible he should be pleased, nor prefer (as many people do) private ad|vantage
before publick convenience: and therefore his first project was, to try if he could

call those who were banished, or at least restore the Ammoniti to their old Offices and Com|mands.
To this purpose he insinuated with several Citizens, whispering it into the ears
first of one, and then of another; that there could be no other way to quiet the people, or
stop the dissention of the parties; concluding, that he attended only till he was of the Se|nate,
and then he would make it his business to bring it to pass. And because, in all humane
actions, delay breeds weariness, and haste danger; to avoid the one, he ran himself upon
the other. Among the Senators, there was Michaele Acciaivoli his confederate, and Nicolo
Ricovers his friend. Donato judged this too fair an opportunity to be slip'd; and therefore
desired them, that they would move to the Council for a Law for restauration of the
Citizens. Being over-persuaded by him, they proposed it to their brethren, who were all
of opinion, that innovations are not to be attempted where the success is doubtful, and the
danger inevitable. Whereupon Donato, having tryed all ways in vain, in his passion caused
it to be told them, that seeing they would not permit the City to be reformed by fair
means, it should be done by foul: which words being highly resented, the Senate commu|nicating
the whole business with the principal Governors,Donato Ac|ciaivoli con|fin'd. cited Donato, who, upon his ap|pearance,
being confronted, and convicted by the person to whom he dilivered his mes|sage,
he was committed to custody, and confined to Barlette. With him were imprisoned
Alamanno, and Antonio de Medici, with all which were descended of Alamanno's Family
and several others of the more inferior Arts, that were in reputation with the people. All
these things happened within two years after Maso had reassumed the Government. The
City remaining in this posture, many discontents at home, and many exiles abroad; there
chanc'd to be at Bologna among the banished men, Piccho Cavicciulli, Tomaso de Ricci, An|tonio
de Medici, Benedetto de gli Spini, Antonio Girolami Christofano di Carlone, with two
more of inferior condition, all of them young, brisk, and disposed to encounter any diffi|culty
that hindred their return to their Country. To these it was privately signified by
Piggiello, and Baroccio Cavicciulli, (who, at the same time, were admonished in Florence)
that if they would come into the Town, they would convey them into an house, from
whence they might kill Maso de gli Albizi, and call the people to Arms; who being discon|tented,
would be easily provoked; and the rather, because they would be headed by the
Ricci, Adimari, Medici, Menelli, and several other considerable Families. Allured by these
hopes,1397. on the fourth of August. 1397, they arrived privately in Florence; and (being dis|posed
of according to agreement) they sent out to observe the motions of Maso, by whose
death they presumed they should raise a tumult among the people. Maso was gone out, and
(by accident) in an Apothecary's shop not far from San Piero Maggiore; the messenger that
was to set him, seeing of him there, repaired immediately to his Comrades to give them
information;A new Con|spiracy de|feated. who taking their swords, ran directly to the place, but he was gone. Not
at all discouraged with their first miscarriage, they turned towards the old Market, where
they killed one of their adversaries. Upon which, a great noise being raised, and a clamor
of the people crying out, Arm, Liberty, Arm; let the Tyrants die; they marched towards
the new Market, where near the Calimara they slew another; and so going forward with
the same shout and out-cry, no-body taking Arms, they stopped in the Loggia della Nighi|tosa:
and mounting there upon the highest place they could find, the multitude
being round about them, (but come rather to stare than assist) they exhorted them to take
Arms, and free themselves from a bondage which so highly they abhorr'd; they assured
them, the complaints and lamentations of such as were oppressed in the City, had moved
them to endeavour their liberty, and not any private injury to themselves: that they were
sensible they had the prayers of many good people, that God would give opportunity to
their designs. Had they had an Head to have commanded them, it was believed they would
have succeeded at any time; but now occasion was offered, and they had Captains enough
to conduct them; they stood gaping upon one another, expecting like sots, till those persons
who endeavoured their freedom, were knock'd on the head, and their slavery redoubled.
They could not likewise but marvel, that they, who, upon the least injury, were heretofore
ready to take Arms, should not stir now upon so great and numerous provocations, but
suffer so many of their Citizens to be banished, and admonished when it was in their power
to restore the one to their Country, and the other to their Offices. These words (how true
soever) moved not the multitude in the least, either because they were affraid, or else because
the death of the two persons which were killed, had made the murderers odious: so that
the founders of the tumult perceiving that neither words nor actions would work any
thing, understanding too late, how dangerous it is to enterprize the liberty of a people that
are resolved to be slaves; and despairing of success, they retreated into the Church of
S. Reparata, not to secure their lives, but to protract their deaths. Upon the first noise of
this tumult, the Senate had arm'd, and caused the Palace to be shut up; but when they

heard what the business was, who were the Authors, and what was become of them; they
took courage, and commanded the Captain, with what Fortes he could get, to go and ap|prehend
them; which was no hard matter to perform; for the Church-doors being
broken open, and part of them slain, the rest were taken prisoners; who, upon examina|tion,
confessed nothing, but that Baroccio and Piggiello Cavicciulli were the only incen|diaries,
and they were both of them killed.
After this accident, there happened another of greater importance. About this time
(as we said before) the City had Wars with the Duke of Milan,The Duke of Milan practi|ses against the City. who finding open force
was not like to prevail, applyed himself to artifice; and by the help of the Florentine exiles,
(of which Lombardy was full) he procured a treaty with several in the Town, in which it
was concluded, that at a certain day, from the nearest places to Florence they could con|trive,
the greatest part of the Exiles which were able to bear Arms, should pass by the river
Arnus into the City; and then joyning suddenly with their friends within, should run to the
Palace of the Senate, and other houses of the chief Officers, and having slain them, model,
and reform afterwards as they pleased. Among the Conspirators in the Town, there was
one of the Ricci called Samminiato, who (as it falls out in most plots, where few are not
sufficient, and many not secure) seeking for a companion, found an informer; for impar|ting
the business to Salvestro Cavicciulli, (whose own injuries, as well as his relations, might
have made him more faithful) he post-poning his future hopes to his present fear, discovered
all to the Senate. Whereupon Samminiato being seized, they extorted the whole process
of the Conspiracy, but of his accomplices no-body was taken, but one Tomaso Davisi; who
coming from Bologna, not knowing what was happened in Florence, was apprehended by
the way, before he got thither; all the rest, upon the imprisonment of Samminiato, fled
away in great fear, and dispersed. Samminiato and Tomaso being punished according to
the quality of their offence, a new Balia was made of several Citizens; and authority given
them to inquire farther after delinquents, and to secure the State. This Balia proclaimed
Rebels,Several Fa|milies banish|ed. 6 of the Family of the Ricci, 6 of the Alberti, 2 of the Medici, 3 of the Scali, 2 of the
Strozzi, Bindo Altoviti, Bernardo Adimari, and several others of meaner condition. They ad|monished,
besides, the whole Family of the Alberti, Ricci, and Medici for ten years, except
only some few. Among those of the Alberti which were not admonished, Antonio was
one, being esteemed a quiet and a peaceable man their jealousie of this plot being not
yet out ot their heads, a Monk happened to be apprehended, who had been observed,
whilst the conspiracy was on foot, to have passed many times betwixt Bologna and Florence
and he confessed he had frequently brought Letters to Antonio; Antonio being taken into
custody, denied it obstinately at first; but being confronted by the Monk, and the charge
justified against him; he was fined in a sum of mony, and banished three hundred miles di|stance
from the City; and that they might not always be in danger of the Alberti, they
decreed, that none of that Family above 15 years of age, should be suffered to continue in
the Town.1400. These things happened in the year 1400, two years after Giovan Galezo Duke
of Milan, died: whose death, (as we have said before) put an end to a War that had been
prosecuted for twelve years. After which, the Government having extended its authority,
and all things at quiet both abroad and at home, they undertook the enterprize of Pisa,
which succeeded so well: they took the Town very honourably, and enjoyed that and the
rest very peaceably, till the year 1433. Only in the year 1412, the Alberti having trans|gress'd
against the terms of their banishment, a new Balia was erected, new provi|sions
made for the security of the State, and new impositions inflicted upon that Fa|mily.
About this time,The King of Naples dies. the Florentines had War likewise against Ladislaus King of Naples,
which ended in the year 1416, upon the death of that King. During the time of the
War, finding himself too weak, he had given the City of Cortona to the Florentines, of
which he was Lord; but afterwards recovering more strength, he renewed his War with
them, and managed it so, that it was much more dangerous than the former; and had not
his death determined it, (as the other was by the death of the Duke of Milan) doubtless he
had brought Florence into as great exigence as the Duke of Milan would have done; and
endangered, if not ruined its liberty. Nor did their War with this King conclude with
less good fortune than the other; for when he had taken Rome, Sienna, la Marka, and Ro|magna;
and nothing remained but Florence, to hinder his passage with his whole force in|to
Lombardy, he died; so that, death was always a true friend to the Florentines, and did more
to preserve them, than all their own conduct or courage could do. From the death of this
King, this City remained at peace (both abroad and at home) eight years: at the end of
that term, their Wars with Philip Duke of Milan, reviv'd their factions, which could never

be suppressed, but with the subversion of the State, which had governed from the year
1371, to 1434, with much honour, and maintained many Wars with much advantage,
having added to their Dominion, Arezzo, Pisa, Cortona, Livorno, and Monte Pulciano,
and doubtless would have extended it farther, had the City been unanimous, and the old
humours not been rubb'd up, and reviv'd, as in the next book shall be more particularly
related.



THE
HISTORY
OF
FLORENCE.
Book IV.
ALL Cities (especially such as are not well constituted under the Titles of Com|mon
Wealths) do sometime or other alter their Government, yet not (as many
think) by means of Liberty and Subjection; but by occasion of servitude, and
licentiousness: for only the name of Liberty is pretended by popular Persons,
such as are the instrument of licentiousness; and servitude is sought for by those that are
Noble, neither of them both desiring to be restrain'd either by Laws or any thing else. Ne|vertheless
when it does happen, (as it happens but seldom) that a City has the good for|tune
to produce, and advance some Wise, Honest, and Potent Citizen, by whom the Laws
may be so order'd, that the humors and emulations betwixt the Nobility and the People
if not perfectly compos'd, may be yet so well circumscrib'd and corrected, that they may be
check'd from breaking forth to its prejudice; Then it is That, City may be call'd free, and
that State pronounce it self durable; for being founded upon good Laws and Orders at first,
it has not that necessity of good Men to maintain it. Of such Laws and Principles many
Common Wealths were antiently constituted; and continued a long time. Others have
wanted, and do still want them; which has frequently occasion'd the variation of the
Government, from Tyranny; to licentiousness; and from licentiousness to Tyranny:
for by reason of the powerful animosities in all of them, it is not, nor can be possible, they
should be of any duation, one disgusting the Good, and the other, the Wise. One do|ing
mischief with ease, and the other good with difficulty; in this the insolent have too
much Authority; in another the sots; and therefore it is convenient that both one and
the other, be supported and maintained by the fortune and Valour of some Eminent Man,
though he may be taken from them by Death, or made unserviceable by misfortune. I
say therefore, that Government which flourished in Florence from the death of Giorgio
Scali, which fell out in the year 1381 was supported first by the conduct of Muso di gli
Albizi, and afterwards by Nicolo Uzano.
This City from the year 1414 till the end of the 22, remain'd quiet, King Ladisans
being dead, and Lombardy divided into several Cantons; so that neither abroad nor at home,
had they the least cause of apprehension. The next Citizens in Authority to Nicolo Uzano,
were Bartolmeo Valori, Nerone de Nigi, Rinaldo de gli Albizi, Neri di Gino, and Lapo Ni|colini.
The factions which sprung from the animosity betwixt the Albizi, and the Ricci
(which were with so much mischief reviv'd afterward by Salvestro de Medici) could never
be extinguish'd, and although that which was most generally succour'd, prevailed but three

years, and was afterwards depress'd, yet the greatest part of the City had imbib'd so much
of their humor, as could never be wrought out. True it is, the frequent exprobrations,
and constant persecutions of the heads of that party from the year 1381 to 1400 had almost
brought them to nothing. The first Families which were persecuted, as the chief of that
faction, were the Alberti, Ricci, and Medici, who were rob'd of their Men, as well as
their Money, and if any of them continued in the City, their imployments and dignities
were most certainly taken from them; which usage had indeed debas'd that party, and al|most
consum'd it. However the memory of the injuries receiv'd, and a secret desire of be|ing
reveng'd lay close in the Hearts of many of them; and having no opportunity to show
it, they kept it private to themselves. Those of the Popular Nobility who govern'd the Ci|ty
so quietly, committed two errours which were the ruine of their Government. One
was in their insolence, upon the long time of their Government; The other, that by reason
of emulations among themselves, contracted by long possession of the State, they had not
preserv'd that inspection which they ought to have done, over those who were able to di|sturb
them. Whereby (dayly running themselves deeper in the displeasure of the People, and
either not regarding new Plots, because they did not apprehend them, or else encoura|ging
them, to supplant one another) the house of Medici recover'd its Authority. The
first of them which began to rise, was Giovanni the Son of Bicci, who, being grown ve|ry
wealthy, of a benign and courteous nature, by concession of those who Govern'd, was
made Supream Magistrate; and his advancement celebrated with so universal satisfaction
and joy (the People believing they had now got a Protector) that the graver sort began
to suspect it,Uzano advi|ces against the Medici. and observing all the old humors reviving again. And Nicolo Uzano fail'd
not to advertise the other Citizens, and to remonstrate how dangerous it was to promote
one of so general a reputation; that disorders were easily suppress'd in the beginning; but
when grown to any height, they were hardly to be remedy'd: and that he knew Giovanni
to be a man in parts much superiour to Salvestro. But Nicolo was not reguarded by his
Brethren, who envy'd his reputation, and desir'd more company to take him down. Flo|rence
being in this manner infested with these humors, which began privately to ferment,
Philippo Visconti,Philippo Vis|conti Lord of Lombardi. second Son to Iohn Galeazo, becoming Lord of Lombardy by the death of
his Brother, supposing himself in a condition for some great enterprize, was very ambitious
to recover the Soveraignty of Genoua, which was then free, under the administration and
conduct of Tomaso da Campo Tregoso; but he durst not be too confident of success either in
that, or any other design, till he had enter'd into an alliance with the Florentines, the repu|tation
of which, he concluded would carry him thorow all. To that purpose he sent two
Embassadors to Florence to propose it. Many Citizens advis'd to the contrary, though
they were contented the amity which had been betwixt them for many years should be con|tinu'd,
yet they had no mind to a League, as knowing what reputation, and advantage
would accrue to him thereby, and how unprofitable it would be to their City. Others
were for the League, by vertue of which they might put such termes upon him, as (if he
transgress'd) should discover his ill intentions to the World, and justifie any War they
should make upon him for the breach of his agreement: after great debate, a Peace was
concluded,Peace be|twixt Elorence, and Milan. and Philip oblig'd himself not to meddle with any thing on this side the Ri|vers
Magra and Panaro. Having settled his alliance, Philip fell upon Brescia, and took it;
and after that upon Genoua; and took that contrary to the opinion of Florence, who had
promoted the peace, they having been confident that Brescia, by the help of the Venetian,
and Genoua by its own proper strength, would have been able to have held out. And be|cause,
in his Treaty with the Doge of Genoua, Philip had reserv'd Serezana and other Towns
on this side the Magra, with condition when ever he would part with them, that the Ge|noeses
should have the refusal (having broke his promise) the whole League was viola|ted;
Besides, he had made an agreement with the Legat of Bologna. All which things
consider'd together, alter'd the affections of the Florentines towards him, and being jealous
of new troubles, made them look out for new remedies. Philip having intelligence of
their apprehensions; to justifie himself, and feel the inclinations of the Citizens, or else to
lull and delude them; he sent Embassadors to Florence, to let them know he was much
surpriz'd at the suspicion he understood they had conceiv'd against him, and was ready to
renounce any thing that might give them the least occasion of displeasure. The effect
this Embassy produc'd in the City, was only to divide it; part (and that the most consi|derable
in the Government) was of opinion they should Arm, and put themselves into a
Posture against the designs of their Enemies. If preparations were made, and Philip was
quiet, no War would ensue, and they might contribute to a Peace. Others out of envy
to the Government, or apprehension of the War, concluded it no Wisdom to be su|spicious
of a friend without great provocation; and that what he had done was not

Worthy (in their judgments) of such rigid proceeding. They knew well enough to
create the Ten, and to raise Men was the same thing as declaring of War, which if done
with so Potent a Prince, would be certain ruine to the City, without any prospect of ad|vantage;
for if they prosper'd, and got the Victory, they could not make themselves Ma|sters
of any thing considerable, Romagna being betwixt, nor could they attempt any thing
aginst Romagna by reason of its vicinity to the Church. However their opinion prevail'd
who were for preparations; they created the Ten, they rais'd Souldiers and laid new
Taxes upon the people; which lying more heavily upon the Common, than the better sort
of Citizens, fill'd the City with complaints, all people crying out of the oppression of the
great people, who to satiate their Ambition, and inlarge their Authority, had ingag'd
them in an expensive and unnecessary War: they were not yet come to an absolute rup|ture
with the Duke, but all things were full of suspition; For Philip, at the request of the
Legate of Bologna (who was fearful of Antonio Bentivogli, a banish'd man, and at that time
in the Castle Bolognese) had sent new forces into that City to secure it, which Forces being
near the Dominions of Florence, created no little jealousie in that State. But that which
gave the strongest alarm to all people, and made the greatest discovery of the War was the
Dukes practices at Furli. The Lord of Furli at that time, was Giorgio Ordelassi, who dy|ing
left his Son Tibaldo to the Tutelage of Philip. The Mother suspecting the integrity of
his Tutor, would have sent him to her Father Lodovico Alidossi Lord of Imola, but the
people of Furli constrain'd her to deliver him up to Philip, in pursuance of the Testament
of Ordelaffi. Philip to disguise his designs, and give less occasion of jealousie, order'd the
Marquess of Ferrara, to send Guido Torelli with certain Souldiers to take possession of
Furli in his Name, and as his Lieutenant, and so that Town fell into the hands of Philip.
Which intillegence coming to Florence at the same time with the news of the arrival of forces
at Bologna, facilitated the resolution for War, though before there had been strong oppo|sition,
and Giovanni de Medici did publickly dissuade it; alleadging that though they were
certain enough of the Dukes inclinations yet it was better to expect him, and receive his
attack, than to prevent it by advancing against him; for it was the beginning of the
War, must Justifie the prosecution; the agressor would be in the fault, and the other ex|cusable
to all the Princes of Italy; Neither could they demand the assistance of their Neigh|bours
with so much confidence, to invade other People, as to defend themselves; nor would
any body ight so chearfully to gain from others, as to secure their own. To this it was
answer'd, that the Enemy was not to be expected at home; that fortune is oftner a friend
to the Invader, than to the invaded; and that (though it may be possibly more expence)
yet there is less damage and detriment in making War in an Enemies Country than in ones
own. These arguments carried it; and Orders were given to the Ten to try all ways, and turn
every stone for the recovery of Furli, out of the hands of the Duke. The Duke observing how
serious and busie the Florentines were in retriving a place he had undertaken to secure, sent
Agnolo della Pergola with a considerable force, to Imola, That the Prince having his hands
full at home, might not be at leisure to think of the defence of his Grandson. Agnola ad|vanc'd
with his Army, near Imola and (though the Florentines lay at Modigliana) took
the Town one night by the benefit of a great Frost which had frozen the Ditches, and sent
Lodovico Prisoner to Milan.Imola taken by the Duke Philip. The Florentines seeing Imola lost; and the War publickly
owned; commanded their Army to march and beseige Furli, which being accordingly
performed, that Town was immediately beleagured, and to hinder the Conjunction of the
Dukes Forces to relieve it, they hired the Comte Alberigo with his Squadron from Zagona|ra,
to keep them in perpetual alarm, and to make daily in-roads to the very walls of Imola:
Agnolo percev'd by the strong entrenchment of our Army, that Furli could not without
great difficulty be reliev'd, so he resolv'd to set down before Zagonara presuming the Flo|rentines
would not lose that place; and that if they came to releive it, they must not only
raise their Seige before Furli; but fight his Army upon great disadvantage. Hereupon the
Duke Alberigo's Forces were constrain'd to a Parley, in which it was agreed the Town
should be surrender'd, if in fifteen days time it was not reliev'd by the Florentines. Their
condition being known in the Florentine Camp, begot great disorders there, as well as in
the City,The Florentines overthrown. and every body desiring to wrest so great a prize out of the hands of the Enemy,
their Host hasten'd the loss of it; form marching from Furli to the relief of Lagonaria they
came to an ingagement and were utterly defeated, not so much by the Valour of their Ene|mies,
as the badness of the weather; for our Men having march'd several hours thorow
deep ways in perpetual rain, finding the Enemy fresh and drawn up with advantage, it
was no hard matter to overcome them. Nevertheless in a Victory so famous all over Ita|ly,
it was strange, and yet true, that there died no body of any Eminence but Lodovico
Albizi, and two of his Sons, who falling from their Horses, were stifled in the dirt. The

news of this defeat put the whole City of Florence into a dumps, especially the Grandees
who had persuaded the War; they saw the Enemy strong and couragious; themselves
without force of friends; the people incens'd, railing up and down the Streets; upbraid|ing
them with the great Taxes, and the impertinence of the War; girding, and scoffing at
them with most contumelious expostulations, are these they which created the Ten to terri|fie
the Enemy? Are these they who have reliev'd Furli, and rescued it out of the hands
of the Duke? See how strangely their Counsels are discover'd, and the ends to which they
inclin'd, not to defend our Liberty (which is an Enemy to them) but to increase their
Power, which God in his Wisdom has most justly diminish'd. Nor is this the only enter|prize
they have pull'd upon the City, but several others, and particularly that against La|disao
which was parallel exactly, To whom will they now address for supplies? To Pope
Martin? Braccio can be witness how they us'd him before: To Queen Giovanna? She was
forc'd formerly to desert them, and throw her self into the Protection of the King of Aragon?
Such language as this, and whatever could be invented by an enraged people, was the Com|mon
dialect in the Streets. To prevent inconveniencies, the Senate thought good to as|semble
several Citizens, who with gentle words should endeavour to quiet those humours,
which were stir'd in the people. Rinaldo de gli Albizi, was one of them, who (being
eldest Son to Maso,Albizi's ex|hortation to be quiet. and by means of his own Vertue and the reputation of his Father, ar|riv'd
at considerable esteem in the City) spake to them at large. He told them that it was
neither justice nor prudence to judge things by success, seeing many times good Counsels
miscarry, and ill ones do prosper. That to commend ill Counsels upon their good success
was to encourage Errour, rather than Virtue, which would turn to the great prejudice of
the publick, because they are not always unfortunate. On the other side, to condemn
wise Counsels for the unhappiness of their event, is as blameable as that; seeing thereby
honest Citizens are discouraged and deter'd from speaking their judgments, though the
exigence be never so great. Then he demonstrated the necessity of the War, and how
(if it had not been carried into Romagna) it would have broke out in Tuscany. He told
them, it had pleas'd God their Army should be beaten; yet their loss was not so great
as it would be, if the design should be abandon'd, but if still they would bear up against
their misfortune, and put themselves forward to the utmost of their Power, they should
not need to be much sensible of their loss nor the Duke of his Victory. That they ought pre|not
to be discourag'd at their Expences and Taxes, it being necessary to increase at them
sent, as a way to lessen them hereafter. He told them that greater supplies are more necessa|ry
in an offensive; than a defensive War, and in conclusion he exhorted them to the imi|tation
of their fore-fathers, who by the Manliness of their behaviour in all their distresses,
did always defend themselves against any Adversary whatever.
Incouraged by his Authority, the Citizens entertain'd the Comte de Oddo Son to Braccio, in|to
their pay; committing him to the instruction of Nicolo Piccinino who had been brought
up under Braccio, and was reputed the best of his Officers; to whom they joyn'd other
Commanders of their own, and certain Horse Officers, which were remaining of the late
defeat. For the raising of more Monys, they created XX. Commissioners out of the Citi|zens;
who finding the chief Citizens low, and depress'd upon the late overthrow, over|laid
them with Taxes, and opress'd them exceedingly. These impositions disgusted
them much; yet at first in the point of honor they thought it beneath them to complain of
their own private usage; only they blam'd the Taxes in general, and press,d to have them
abated; being publickly known, it was publickly oppos'd; and so far neglected in the
Councils, that to make them sensible how difficult a matter they had undertaken, and to
render them odious to the people, order was given that the Taxes should be collected
with all strictness and severity; and in case of opposition, it should be lawful for any man
to kill him who resist an Officer. Whereupon many sad accidents ensued among the
Citizens; many being wounded, and not a few slain: so that it was believ'd the Parties
would have proceeded to Blood; and every sober man apprehended some mischief at hand.
The Grandees haveing been accustomed to be favour'd, could not endure that strictness, and
the others thought it but just to have all taxed proportionably. In these confusions, seve|ral
of the Prime Citizens met, and concluded to take the Government upon themselves, be|cause
their backwardness and remisness had given the multitude confidence to reprehend
actions of the State, and reincourag'd such as were wont to be the heads of the people. Af|ter
many Cabals, and frequent discourses among themselves, it was propos'd to meet alto|gether
at a time, which they did above LXX. of them in the Church of St. Stephano, by the
connivance of Lorenzo Ridolfi de Fidi, and Francesco Gianfigliazzi, two of the Senate.
Giovanni de medici was not at the meeting, either not being call'd (as a Person in whom
they could put no confidence) or refusing to come being contrary to his judgment. Ri|naldo

de gli Albizi made a Speech to them all. He remonstrated to them the condition
of the City;Rinaldo de gli Albizi. how by their negligence the Authority was relaps'd to the people, which in
the year 1381, their Fathers had taken out of their hands. he represented the iniquity
of the Government from 1377. to the year 1380. and remember'd them how in that Inte|rim,
many there present had had their Fathers and Relations kill'd. That now the dan|gers
were the same, and the disorders no better. That the multitude had already im|pos'd
a Tax as they pleas'd; and would doubtless by degrees (unless greater force, or
better order was taken to prevent them) create Magistrates at their pleasure. which if
they should do, they would usurp their places, and ruine a State which for 42 years toge|ther
had flourish'd with much honour and reputation to the City; and Florence fall under
the Government of the multitude, (one half in perpetual luxury, and the other in
fear) or else under the Tyranny of some single Person that should usurp. Wherefore
he assured himself that whoever was a lover of Honor or his Country, would think him|self
oblig'd to resent it and be put in mind of the Virtue of Bardo Mancini, who with
the destruction of the Alberti rescued the City from the same dangers; and as the occasi|on
of that boldness and incroachment of the multitude proceeded from negligence and re|missness
in the Magistrate, the Palace of the Senate being full of new and inferior men, he
concluded, the best way to remedy it, would be to do as they did then; to restore the
the Government to the Grandees to clip the wings of the inferiour Trades by reducing
them from XIV. to VII. By which means their authority in the Councils would be re|trench'd,
both by the diminution of their number, and the restauration of the Nobility,
who upon the old score of animosity would be sure to keep them under; adding that
it was great Wisdom to make use of all people, opportunity, and according to the conve|nience
of their time: for if their fore-fathers had done prudently to make use of the mul|titude
to correct the insolence of the Grandees; it would be no less discretion, now the
people were grown insolent, and the Nobility under hatches, to make use of the Nobi|lity
to reduce them to their balance; which might be two ways effected either by ar|tifice,
or force: for some of them being in the Commission of Ten, it was in their power
to bring what numbers they thought good into the City, and to dispose them as they pleasd
without any observation.
Rinaldo was much applauded,Nicolo Urano. his Counsel by every Body approv'd; and Urano a|mong
the rest, return'd this answer. That indeed all that had been said by Rinaldo was
true, his remedies good and secure, when applyable without manifest division of the Ci|ty;
and that might be done exactly, if Giovanni de Medici could be drawn to their party;
if he were separated from them, the people might rise, but could do nothing for want of
a head; but whilst he was firm to them, nothing was to be done without force and if
they should betake themselves to that, he could not but foresee a double danger either of
not gaining the Victory; or not injoying it when it was got. He modestly remember'd
them of his former advices, and how they had neglected to prevent these difficulties in
time, which might easily have been done; But that now he thought it unpracticable, un|less
some way could be found to gain Giovanni to their party.
Hereupon Rinaldo was deputed to attend Giovanni, and try what might be done He
waited upon him, and press'd him with all the arguments he could use to joyn with them,
and that he would not, by favouring and indulging the people make them insolent and
sawcy to the ruine both of the City and Government. To which Giovanni re|ply'd,
That it was the Office of a wise and good Citizen (at least in his judgment) to pre|serve
the ancient laws and customs of a City;Giovanni de Medici's reply to Rinaldo. nothing being more injurious than those
alterations; that many being offended, it must necessarily follow many must be discon|tented
and where many are so, some ill accident or other is daily to be expected. That
in his opinion this resolution of their's would be subject to two most pernicious effects.
The first by conferring honors upon them, who having born none of them before, would
understand less how to value them, and by consequence complain less for the want of them.
The other in taking them away from those who have been accustomed to them, and
would assuredly never be quiet till they be restor'd to them again. So that the injury to
one party will be greater than the benefit to the other; the author of the change gains few|er
Friends than Enemies; and the latter be much more industrious to do him a mischief,
than the former to defend him. Men being naturally more prone to revenge, than gra|titude;
loss (for the most part) being in the one, but profit or pleasure always in the
other. Then, turning about to Rinaldo, he said. And you, Sir, if you would recollect
what has pass'd, and with what cunning and subtilty things have been formerly transact|ed
in this City, you would be cooler and less hasty in this resolution; for who ever ad|vis'd

it, as soon as with your power he has divested the people of their Authority, be
will usurp upon you, and become your Enemy by the same means you intend to oblige
him. Nor will it fall out better to you than it did to Benedetto Alberto, who by the
persuations of those who did not love him, consented to the ruine of Giorgio scali and
Tomaso Strozzi, and not long after was himself banish'd by the same Persons which in|veigled
him: he advis'd him therefore to consider more seriously of the busness, and ra|ther
than to proceed, to follow the example of his Father, who to ingratiate with the
people, abated the Excise upon Salt; procur'd, that whosoevers Taxes was half a Flo|ren
or under, should pay it if they pleas'd, otherwise it should never be levyed. Pre|vail'd
that the day the Councils assembled, should be priviledg'd; and all Persons for
that time protected from their Creditors; and at last concluded that for his own part he
was resolv'd to acquiesce in the Government as it stood then, and to leave the City as he
found it.
These transactions being talk'd of abroad, procur'd much reputation to Giovanni, but
more hatred to the other Citizens whose conversation he declin'd what he could, to give
the less encouragement to those who designed new troubles, under his familiarity and fa|vour:
declaring to every Body he discours'd withal about it, that in his judgment, facti|ons
were rather to be extinguish'd, than fomented at that time; and that as to himself, he
desir'd nothing more cordially, than love and unanimity in the City, though several of his
own party were dissatisfi'd with him, and had advis'd him to be more stirring and active
in the busness. Among the rest Alainanno de Medici was one, who being naturally furious,
egg'd him on to take this oportunity of revenging himself upon his Enemies, and obliging
his friends; reproaching him by the coldness of his proceedings, which (as he told him)
gave his Enemies occasion to practise against him, without fear or respect; which practices
(it was to be doubted) would succeed one time or other, and be the destruction both of
his family and friends. Cosimo, his Son, importun'd him to the same, but Giovanni, neither
for what had been reveal'd, nor prognosticated could be mov'd from his resolution;
however, the faction appear'd plain enough, and the whole City was most manifestly divi|ded.
There were at that time attending the Senate in the Palace, two Chancellors, Mar|tino,The sacti|ons of Uzano, and the Medici
and Pagolo. The latter was a favourer of Uzano, the former of the Medici. Rinal|do,
finding Giovanni inexorable and not to be wrought over to them, contrived to turn
Martino out of his office, presuming after that the Senate would be more inclinable to them.
Which design being smelt by the Adversary, Martino was not only continued in his Place
but Pagolo turn'd out to the great detriment and dissatisfaction of his party, and doubt|less
the effects would have been dreadful, had not the War lien so heavy upon them, and
the late defeat at Zagonara, put the City into such confusion. For whilst these things were
agitated in Florence, Agnolo della Pergola with the Dukes Troops had taken all the Towns
which the Florentines held in Romagna, (except Castracaro and Modigliana) some for
want of due fortification, and some for want of courage or fidelity in the Garisons. In the
acquisition of these Towns, two things happen'd, which demonstrate how grateful valour is
even to an Enemy, and how much cowardize and pusillanimity is despis'd. Biagio del Mi|lano
was Captain of the Castle call'd Montepetroso, which being not only besieg'd, but set
on fire by the Enemy, looking over the walls, and finding no way to escape, or preserve
the Castle, he caus'd straw and bedding, and what other cloaths he had, to be thrown o|ver
the walls, where he saw the fire was not yet come, and then letting down two of his Chil|dren
upon them,The great courage of Bi|agio del Mila|no. he cry'd out to the Enemy, Here take such moveables as God and my for|tune
have given me; 'tis in your power to force them, and not in mine to preserve them; but for
the treasure of my mind, in which my glory, and honour consists you cannot ravish that from me,
and I will never surrender it. The Enemy (amaz'd at his Gallantry) ran presently to
save the Children, and presented him Ropes and Ladders to have preserv'd himself; but he
refus'd them, and chose rather to die in the flames, than to be sav'd by the Enemies of his
Country. An example worthy of the commendation of Antiquity, and the more remark|able
by how much few of them are to be found. The Children were restor'd to what
ever could be preserv'd and sent home by the Enemy (with singular generosity) to their
Relations, who receiv'd them not with more joy, than they were entertain'd by the State,
which for their Fathers and their own sakes, kept them at the publick charge during their
lives.
The other happen'd in Galeata,The Cowar|dize of Zenobi del Pino. where Zenobi del Pino was Podesta, who without any
defence at all, deliver'd up his Castle to the Enemy, and afterwards persuaded Agnolo to
quit the Alps in Romagna, and betake himself to the hills in Tuscany where he might spin
out the War with more advantage, and less danger to himself. Agnolo not able to brook such
meanness and baseness of his Spirit, deliver'd him over to his Servants to dispose of him as

they pleas'd, who after millions of affronts, and derisions allow'd him nothing but painted
cards for his dyet,, declaring they intended of a Guelf to make him a Ghibilin that way, but
what ever they intended, in a short time he was starv'd to Death.
In the mean time Conte Oddo, with Nicolo Piccinino were enter'd into the Valdi Lamona,
to see if they could reduce the State of Faenza to an amity with the Florentines; or at the
least hinder Agnola della Pergola from making his incursions so freely into the territory of
Romagna. But the vale being very strong: and the inhabitants martial, Conte Oddo was
slain, and Piccinino carried Prisoner to Faenza. However as it fell out, the Florentines
obtain'd by this loss, what they would have hardly gain'd by the victory; for Nicolo Piccinino
transacted so well with the Governour of Faenza, and his Mother, that by his persuasion,
they became friends to the Florentines, and enter'd into a League with them, by which he
was releas'd. But Piccinino follow'd not that Counsel which he had given to others: for
either being debauch'd by the Towns he pass'd thorow; or looking upon the condition of
the Florentines to be but low,Picinino re|volts. and his own to be better'd in another place; he departed
abruptly from Arrezzo, where his post was and stealing away into Lombardy, he took up
Arms under that Duke. The Florentines weaken'd by these accidents; and disheartened
by the expence of the War; concluded they were unable to carry it on, upon their own
private account; hereupon they sent Embassadors to the Venetians, to desire their assistance
(which they might easily and effectually grant) against the growing greatness of a Person,
who if let alone, would be as dangerous and destructive to them, as to the Florentines.
Francesco Carmignuola persuaded them likewise to the same enterprize, who was an excel|lent
Souldier as any in those times; had serv'd formerly under the Duke. But then he was
revolted from him, and come over to the Venetian. The Venetian was uncertain what to
determine, not daring to be too confident of Carmignuola, because not sure whether his
animosity to the Duke, was real or pretended. Whilst they remain'd in this suspence, the
Duke found a way, by corrupting one of his Servants, to cause him to be poison'd, but the
poison being too weak did not kill him out-right but brought him to great extremity. The
Venetians having notice of this, laid their suspition aside; and the Florentines continuing
their solicitations, they enter'd into League with them, by which it was agreed the War
should be prosecuted by both parties, at the common expence; that what ever should be
taken in Lombardy, should be deliver'd to the Venetians; and what ever in Romagna and
Tuscany,Carmignu|ola General of the League. should be put into the hands of the Florentines: and Carmignuola was made Gene|ral
of the League. By means of this alliance the War was transfer'd into Lombardy, where
it was manag'd by Carmignuola with that discretion and courage, that in a few months
time he took several Towns from the Duke, and Brescia among the rest; which last in those
times, and according to the method of those Wars, was accounted a miracle. This War
continued five years, and the Citizens of Florence were much impoverish'd by the Taxes
which had been continued as long. Hereupon a regulation was agreed upon, and (that
all people might be charg'd according to their Estates) it was propos'd the Personal Estate
should be chargeable as well as the real; and that who ever had to the value of a hundred
Florens in goods, should pay half a proportion. But there being Law and Authority to
levy this Tax, but not men enough to compel them, the Grandees were disgusted, and
oppos'd it, before it was perfectly concluded: only Giovanni de Medici promoted it so vigo|rously,
that he carried it against them all. And because in the Books of assesment, every
man's goods were rated (which the Florentines call Accatastare) this imposition was call'd
Catasto.Catasto. Moreover this Law restrain'd the Tyranny of the Nobles, not permitting them
to strike, or terrifie such as were inferior to them, in the Counsels, as formerly they had
presum'd. This Tax therefore though accepted chearfully enough by the Commons, went
much against the minds of the Nobility. But it being in the Nature of man, never to be
satisfi'd, and as soon as possess'd of what with great vehemence he desir'd, to wish as fierce|ly
for another. The people not content with the proportions set them by the Law, de|manded
a retrospection, and that it might be consider'd how much the Nobility had paid
less in times past, than was now allotted them by the Catasto, and that they might be forc'd
to pay it for the reinbursement of such as had sold their Estates to enable them to pay their
Taxes before. This proportion affrighted the Grandees much more than the Catasto: so
that to defend themselves against both, they decry'd the Catasto as unjust and unequal, in
laying a Duty upon goods and houshold-stuff (which are here to day, and lost to morrow)
and exempting mony, which many people kept privatly in their hands, so as the Catasto could
not discover it. To which they added, that it was not but reasonable those Persons who re|linquish'd,
or neglected their own private affairs for the better management of the publick,
should be favour'd in the Taxes; for devoting their whole labour to the benefit of the
State, there was no justice nor equity in the World, that the City should have the profits

of their Industry, and Estate, and from others receive only the contribution of their E|states.
Those who were for the Catasto, reply'd that as their goods varied, the Taxes
might be varied too; and to any inconvenience from that, a remedy might be found. As
to the mony conceal'd, that was not to be consider'd for making no profit of it, there was
no reason it should be paid for; and when ever they imploy'd it, it would be sure to be dis+cover'd.
For the pains they took, and their solicitude for their Country, if it were trouble|some
to them, they might have liberty to retire, for there was no doubt but some well af|fected
Citizens would be found, who would not repine to serve the City both with their
Counsel and Estates: and that there were so many honors, and other perquisits attending
those great Offices, as might suffice any reasonable Persons, without abatement of their
Taxes. But their great discontent was from another cause; the Nobility were offended
that they could not make War at other peoples, charge, as they were us'd to do formerly
but were oblig'd to bear their share as well as their Neighbours. Had this way been
found out before, there would have been no War with King Ladisao, then; nor with
Duke Philip now; both which Wars were undertaken to fill the coffers of some particular
Citizens, more than for any general necessity; but this commotion of humours, was ap|peas'd
by Giovanni de Medici, who convinc'd the people, it was not convenient to look
backward. That their business now was to provide carefully for the future, and if the
former impositions had been unequal and injust, they were to thank God a way was found
to relieve them, and not make that a means to divide which was intended to unite the
City; as it would certainly do, if the old assesments, and the new were adjusted, for it
was better to be contented with half a victory than to venture all for an absolute; many
instances making it out, that where more has been striv'd for, all has been lost. With
these and such like discourses, he pacified the people, and the design of retrospection was
quie laid aside.
However the War with the Duke being carried on for a while, a peace at length was con|cluded
at Ferrara by the mediation of a Legate from the Pope. But the Duke not obser|ving
the conditions at first, the League took Arms again, and coming to an engagement
with his Army at Maclovio they defeated him quite, and forc'd the Duke to new proposi|tions,Peace betwixt the league and the Duke.
which were accepted by the League: by the Florentines, because they were grown
jealous of the Venetian, and sensible, that the vast charge which their City was at, was to
make others more powerful than themselves. by the Venetians, because they observ'd
Carmignuola, after the Duke was overthrown, to advance but slowly, and make little or
no advantage of his victory, so as they could not place any further confidence in him. In
this manner the peace was concluded in the year 1428,1428. by which the Florentines were re|stor'd
to what they had lost in Romagna; the Venetians had Brescia, and the Duke gave
them Bergamo, and the Territory belonging to it, over and above. This War cost the
Florentines 3 millions and five thousand Ducats; the success of which, was Grandeur
and Authority to the Venetian, but poverty and dissention to themselves. Peace being
concluded abroad, the War was transplanted, and broke out at home. The Grandees of
the City could not digest the Catasto; and not seeing any way of suppressing it, they con|triv'd
ways of incensing the people against it that they might have more Companions to
oppose it. They remonstrated therefore to the Officers for collection, that they were to
search, and Catastat the goods of the Neighbouring Towns, lest any of the Florentine goods
should be conveyed thither. Whereupon all that were Subjects to that City, were requir'd
to bring In Inventories of their goods within a certain time. But the Volterrani complain|ing
to the Senate, incensed the Officers so highly, they put eighteen of them in Prison.
This action provok'd the Volterrani exceedingly, but the regard they had for their Prisoners,
kept them at present from any commotion.
About this time Giovanni de Medici fell Sick, and finding his Sickness to be mortal,
he call'd his Sons Cosimo and Lorenzo to him, and said;
I suppose the time that God, and Nature allotted me at my Birth, is now expir'd I
die contented,Giovanni de Medici's Speech to his Sons at his Death. leaving you rich, and healthful, and honourable, (if you follow my foot|steps
and instruction) and indeed nothing makes my Death so easie and quiet to me, as
the thought that I have been so far from injuring or disobliging any Person, that I have
done them all the good offices I was able; and the same course I recommend to you. For
matter of Office and Government (if you would live happy and secure) my advice is, you ac|cept
what the Laws and the people confer upon you; that will create you neither envy
nor danger, for 'tis not what is given that makes men Odious, but what is usurp'd; and
you shall always find greater number of those who encroaching upon other peoples inte|rest,
ruine their own at last, and in the mean time live in perpetual disquiet. With these
arts, among so many factions and enemies, I have not only preserv'd but augemented my

reputation in this City, if you follow my example, you may maintain and increase yours.
But if neither my example nor persuasion can keep you from other ways, your ends will
be no happier than several others who in my memory have destroy'd both themselves and
their Families.
Not long after he died, and was infinitly lamented by the greatest part of the City, as
indeed his good qualities deserv'd: for he was charitable to the height; not only reliev|ing
such as he ask'd but preventing the modesty of such as he thought poor, and supply|ing
them without it. He loved all People: the good the Commended; the bad he Commi|serated.
He sought no Office, and went through them all. He never went to the Palace,
but invited. He was a lover of Peace, and an Enemy to War. He reliev'd those who were
in adversity, and those who were in prosperity he assisted. He was no friend to publick
extortion, and yet a great argumenter of Common Stock. Courteous in all his imploy|ments;
not very eloquent, but solid, and judicious. His complexion appear'd melancho|ly,
but in company he was pleasant and facetious. He died rich, especially in Love and Re|putation;
and the inheritance of all descended upon his Son Cosimo.
The Volterrani were weary of their Imprisonment, and to recover their liberties, pro|mis'd
to condescend to what was requir'd.Cosino heir his Father. Giusto. Being discharg'd, and return'd to Volterra,
the time for the new Priori's entrance into the Magistracy arriv'd, and one Giusto (a Ple|beian
but a Man of good interest among them) was chosen in the place. Having
been one of those who were imprison'd at Florence he had conceiv'd a mortal hatred against
the Florentines, and it was much increas'd by the instigation of one Giovanni (a Person of
Noble extraction) who being in Authority with him at the same time persuaded him
that by the authority of the Priori, and his own interest, he would stir up the People to rescue
themselves from their dependance upon Florence, and afterwards make himself Prince: up|on
this incouragement Giusto took Arms; possess'd himself of the Town; imprison'd the
Florentine Governor, and, by consent of the people, made himself Lord. The news of
these revolutions in Volterra,Volterra re|volts. was not at all pleasing to the Florentines; But their peace be|ing
made with the Duke, and their Articles sign'd they thought they had leisure enough
to recover that Town; and to lose no time, they made Rinaldo de gli Albizi, and Palla
Strozzi Commissioners, and sent them thither out of hand. Guisto suspecting the Floren|tines
would assault him, sent to Sienna, and Lucca for relief. The Siennesi refus'd him,
alledging they were in League with the Florentine: and Pagolo Guinigi (who was then
Lord of Lucca) to reingratiate with the people of Florence (whose favour he had lost in
their Wars with the Duke) not only deny'd his assistance to Giusto, but sent his Embassa|dor
Prisoner to Florence. The Commissioners to surprize the Volterrani, before they
were aware, assembled what strength they had of their own, rais'd what foot they could
in the lower Val d' Arno, and the territory of Pisa: and march'd towards Volterra. Gi|usto
discourag'd neither by the desertion of his Neighbours, nor the approach of the Ene|my,
rely'd upon the situation, and strength of the Town; and prepar'd for his defence.
There was at that time in Volterra, one Arcolano (a Brother of that Giovanni who had
persuaded Giusto to take the Government upon him) a Person of good credit among the
Nobility. This Arcolano having got several of his Confidents together, he remonstrated to
them, how God Almighty by this accident had reliev'd the necessities of their City; for if
they would take Arms with him; remove Giusto from the Government, and deliver all up
to the Florentines, they should not only have their old priviledges confirm'd, but be them|selves
made the chief Officers of the Town. Having consented to the design; they repair'd
immediatly to the Palace where Giusto resided; and leaving the rest below Arcolano with
three more went up into the dining-room, where they found him with other Citizens; they
pretended to speak with him, about business of importance, and having (in the variety of
their discourse) drill'd him to another Chamber, Arcolano and his accomplices fell upon
him with their Swords: but they were not so nimble but Giusto had the opportunity to draw
his, and wound two of them, before he fell himself, yet his destiny being unavoidable, he
was kill'd,Giusto slain. and thrown out into the Palace yard. Wherupon those who were Confederate
with Arcolano taking Arms, they deliver'd up the Town to the Florentine Commissioners
who were not far off with their Army. The Commissioners march'd directly into the
Town, without any Capitulation, so that then the condition of the Volterrani was worse
than before; for among other things, a great part of their Country, was dismembred; and
the Town it self reduc'd to a Vicariata. Volterra being in this manner lost, and recover'd
at the same time, there had been no danger of new War, had not the ambition of some
Men pull'd it down upon their heads. There was a person who for a long time had serv'd the
Florentines in their Wars against the Duke: his name was Nicolo Fortebraccio, Son of a
Sister of Braccio da perugia. This Nicolo was disbanded upon the Peace; and at the time of

these accidents at Volterra had his quarters at Fucecchio, so that the Commissioners made
use of him, and his Souldiers in that enterprize. It was believ'd, that whilst Rinaldo was
engag'd with him in that War, he had persuaded Nicolo upon some pretended quarrel, to
fall upon the Lucchesi; assuring him that if he did, he would order things so in Florence,
that an Army should be sent against Lucca, and he have the command of it. Volterra be|ing
reduc'd, and Nicolo return'd to his old Post at Fucecchio; either upon Rinaldo's in|stigation,
or his own private inclination, in Novem. 1429. with 300 Horse and 300 Foot,
he surpriz,d Ruoti, and Compito two Castles belonging to the Lucchesi; and afterwards
falling down into the plain he made great depredation. The news being brought to
Florence, the whole Town was in uproar, and the greatest part was for an expedition a|gainst
Lucca. Of the chief Citizens which favour'd the Enterprize, there were all the Me|dici,
and Rinaldo, who was prompted thereto either out of an opinion it would be for the
advantage of that Common-Wealth, or out of an ambition to be made head of it himself.
Those who oppos'd it were Nicolo da Uzano, and his party. And it seems an incredible
thing, that in one City, upon one occasion, there should be such contrariety of Judgments.
For the same people who after ten years Peace, oppos'd the War against Duke Philip,
(which was undertaken in defence of their liberties) the same Persons now, after such
vast expence, and so many Calamities as their City had undergone, press'd and importun'd
for a War with the Lucchesi, to disturb the Liberties of other People. And on the other
side, those who were for the War then, resisted it now. So strangely does time alter the
Judgments of Men; so much more prone are people to invade their Neighbours, than to
secure themselves, and so much more ready are they to conceive hopes of gaining upon others
than to apprehend any danger of losing their own. For dangers are not believ'd till they
be over their heads; but hopes are entertain'd though at never so great distance. The
People of Florence were full of hopes upon intelligence of what Nicolo Fertebraccio had done
and did still do, and upon certain letters which they received from their Rettori upon the
confines of Lucca. For their deputies in Pescia, and Vico, writ them word that if they
might have librty to receive such Castles and Towns as would be deliver'd up to them, they
should be Masters of the greatest part of the Territory of Lucca: and it contributed not a
little to their encouragement, that at the same time, they received an Embassie from the Se|nate
of Lucca, to complain of Nicolo's invasion, and to beg of the Senate that they would
not make War upon a Neighbour City, which had preserv'd a constant amity with them.
The Embassador's name was Iacopo Vicciani; who had been Prisoner not long before to
Pagolo Guinigi Lord of Lucca, for a Conspiracy against him; and (though found guilty)
had been pardon'd for his Life. Supposing he would have as easily have forgiven his im|prisonment,
as Pagolo had done his offence he imploy'd him in this Embassie, and sent him
to Florence. But Iacopo being more mindful of the danger he had escap'd, than the bene|fit
he had receiv'd; encouraged the Florentines to the enterprize; which encouragement ad|ded
to the hopes they had conceiv'd before, and caus'd them to call a General Council (in
which 498. Citizens appear'd) before whom the whole project was more particularly
debated.
Among the Principal promoters of the expedition (as I said before) Rinaldo was one,Rinaldo per|sades the War.
who represented to them, the great advantage that would accrue to them by the taking
of that Town, He insisted upon the convenience of the time, as being abondon'd by
the Venetian, and the Duke; and not capable of relief from the Pope, who had his
hands full another way. To which he added the easiness of the enterprize, the Govern|ment
having been usurp'd by one of its own Citizens, and by that means lost much of
its natural vigor, and ancient disposition to defend its liberties; so that it was more than
probable, either the people would deliver it up, in opposition to the Tyrant, or the Ty|rant
surrender for fear of the people. He exaggerated the injuries that Governor had
done to their State, the ill inclination he still retain'd towards them; and the dangers
which would ensue if the Pope or Duke should make War upon it; concluding that no
enterprize was ever undertaken by the State of Florence more easie, more profitable, or
more just.
In opposition to this it was urg'd by Uzano that the City of Florence never under|took
any War with more injustice,Uzano oppo|ses it or hazard, nor any that was more like to produce sad
and pernicious effects. That first, they were to invade a City of the Guelfish faction,
which had been always a friend to the City of Florence; and to its own danger and pre|judice
many times receiv'd the Guelfs into its bosom, when they were banish'd, or unsafe
in their own Country. That in all the Chronicles of our affairs, it was not to be found,
that City had ever offended Florence, whilst it was free; and if at any time since its sub|jection,
it had transgress'd, (as indeed it had during the Government of Castruccio, and

under this present Lord) it was but reasonable to lay the sadle upon the right Horse;
and to impute the fault rather to their Tyrants, than Town. If War could be made a|gainst
the Tyrant, without detriment to the City, well and good; the injustice would
be the less. But that being impossible, he could never consent that a City of so ancient
amity and allyance, should be ruin'd for nothing. However because Men liv'd then at
such a rate, that no account was made of what was just and unjust, he would wave so
trifling an argument, and proceed to the profit and emolument of that War, which
was the thing now adays most seriously considered: did believe those things were most
properly call'd profitable, which carried least damage along with them; but how that
expedition could with any equity be call'd profitable, he could not understand; seeing
the damage was certain, and the benefit but contingent. The certainty of the damage
consisted, in the vastness of the expence which must of necessity be great enough to dis|courage
a City that was quiet and at peace, much more one that had been already har|rass'd
out with a tedious and a chargeable War as their City had been. The advantages
propos'd were the taking of Lucca, which he confess'd would be considerable. Yet the
accidents and impediments with which they might meet were so far from being to be
slighted, that to him they seemed numerous and insuperable, and the whole enterprize
impossible. Nor ought they to presume that either the Venetian or the Duke would be
content that they should conquer it, for though the Venetian seem'd to comply, it
was but in gratitude to the Florentines at whose charges they had so largely extended their
Empire, and the other was only cautious of engaging in a new War, and new expence, and
attended till they were tired and exhausted, that he might fall upon them with advan|tage.
He minded them likewise, that in the middle of their enterprize, and in the
highest hopes of their Victory, the Duke would not want means to releive the Lucchesi,
either by supplying them with mony under hand, or if that would not do, by disbanding
his Men, and sending them as Souldiers of Fortune, to take pay under them. Upon these
reasons he persuaded them to give over that design, and to live so with that Usurper, as
to create him what Enemies they could, for he knew no way so ready to subdue the Town,
as to leave it to his Tyranny, and let him alone to afflict and weaken it as he pleas'd. So
that if the business was manag'd as it should be, that City might quickly be brought to such
terms that the Usurper, not knowing how to hold it, and the City as unable to Go|vern
it self, would be constrain'd to throw it self voluntarily under their protection. Ne|vertheless
seeing their eagerness was such that his reasons could not be heard, he would
undertake to prognosticate; that the War which they were about should cost them much
mony; expose them to many dangers at home, and in stead of taking Lucca, and
keeping it to themselves, they should deliver it from an Usurper, and of a poor, er|vile,
but friendly City, make it free, and malicious, and such as in time would grow to
be a great obstacle to the greatness of Florence.
This enterprize being thus canvassed on both sides, it came (privately and according to
custom) to the votes of the whole Convention, and of the whole number, only 98 were
against it. Resolution being taken, and the ten men created for the carrying on of the War,
they rais'd men with all speed both infantry and Horse. For Commissaries, they deputed
Astorre Gianni, and Rinaldo de gli Albizzi, and made an agreement with Nicolo Fortebac|cio
that he should deliver what Towns he had taken, into their hands, and take pay under
them. The Commissaries being arriv'd with their Army in the Country of Lucca, they di|vided,
Astorre extending himself upon the plain towards Camaggiore, and Pietra Santa; and
Rinaldo with his Squadron marching towards the Mountains, presuming that if they cut off
its intercourse with the Country, it would be no hard matter to become Masters of the
Town. But both their designs were unhappy; not but that they took several Castles and
Towns, but because of sundry imprudences committed in the management of the War,
both by the one and the other. Astorre Gianni gave particular evidence of his indiscretion
in the passage which follows. Not far from Pietra Santa there is a vale call'd Seraveza, rich,
full of Inhabitants; who understanding the approach of that Commissary went out to
meet him, and to desire that he would receive and protect them as faithful servants to
the people of Florence. Astorre pretended to accept their offer, but afterwards he caus'd his
Souldiers to seize upon all the strong places,The Cruelty of Astro. and passes in the vale; and assembling all the
Inhabitants in their Principal Church; he kept them Prisoners and commanded his men to
plunder and destroy the whole Country; after a most cruel and barbarous way, prophaning
the Churches and Religious Houses, and abusing the Women, as well Virgins as others.
These passages being known in Florence, offended not only the Magistrates, but the whole
City. Some of the Seravezi, who had escap'd the hands of the Commissary, fled directly to
Florence, telling the sadness of their condition to all Persons they met with, and being en|couraged

by several who were desirous to have Astorre punish'd, either as an evil Man, or
as an adversary to their faction;The Sera|vezzesi com|plain. they address'd themselves to the Ten, and desired to be
heard; and being introduc'd, one of them step'd forth and spake to this purpose.
We are assured (most magnificent Lords) our words would not only find belief, but
compassion among you, did you but know in what manner your Comissary first seiz'd
upon our Country, and afterwards upon us. Our Vale (as 'tis likely your Chronicles may
remember you) was always of the Guelfish party; and many times a faithful receptacle
for such of your Citizens as by the persecution of the Ghibilins, were not suffered at home.
Our Ancestors and we have always ador'd the very name of this Illustrious Republick; and
esteem'd it as the head and principal member of that party. Whilst Lucca was Guelfish,
we submitted very quietly to their Commands; but since it fell under the dominion of an
Usurper, who has relinquished its old friends, and joyn'd himself with the Ghibilins, we
have obey'd him, tis true, but rather by force, than by consnt: and God knows how of|ten
we have beg'd for an opportunity to express our affection to our old friends. But
how blind and deceitful are the desires of Man; That which we prayed for, as our only
felicity, is become our destruction. As soon as we heard your Ensigns were marching
towards us, supposing them not our Enemies, but our ancient Lords, and friends, we went
immediatly to wait upon your Commissary, and committed our valley, our fortunes,
and our selves into his hands, relying wholly upon his Generosity, and presuming he had
the Soul (if not of a Florentine) at least of a Man. Pardon (I beseech you) my free|dom,
we have suffer'd so much already, nothing can be worse, and that gives me this confi|dence.
Your General has nothing of a Man but his Person, nor of a Florentine but his Name.
He is a mortal Disease, a savage Beast, and as horrid a Monster as ever any Author ever
describ'd. For having wheedled us together into our Cathedral under pretence of dis|coursing
some things with us, he made us his Prisoners: ruin'd and burn'd our valley;
rob'd, and spoiled, and sacked, and beat, and murdered the inhabitants; the Women he
ravish'd, the Virgins he forced, tearing them out of the arms of their Parents, and throwing
them as a prey to his Souldiers. Had we provok'd him by any injury ither to his Country
or himself: we should have been so far from complaining, we should have condemn'd our
selves; and esteem'd it no more than what our own insolence and unworthiness had pull'd
upon our heads. But having put our selves freely into his power; without Arms or any
other capacity of resistance; to be then rob'd, and abus'd, with so much injury and in|solence,
is beyond humanie patience, and we cannot but resent it. And though we
might make all Lombardy ring with the sadness of our complaints; and with imputation,
and scandal to this City, diffuse the story of our sufferings all over Italy, we have waved
nd declin'd it, thinking it unjust to asperse so Noble, so Charitable a Common-wealth,
with the cruelty and dishonour of a Barbarous Citizen, whose insatiable avarice had we
known, or could have but suspected, before we had try'd it; we would have strain'd and
and forc'd our selves to have gorg'd it (though indeed it has neither bounds nor bottom) and
by that means (if possible) preserv'd part of our Estates, by sacrificing the rest. But that
being too late, we have address'd our selves most humbly to your Lordships, begging that
ye should releive the infelicity of your Subjects; that other People may not (by our
president) be terrifi'd or discourag'd from committing themselves under your Empire
and Dominion. If the infinite and unsupportable injuries we have suffer'd, be too weak
or few to procure your compassion; yet let the fear of God's displeasure prevail, whose Tem|ples
have been plundr'd and burn'd, and his People betraid in the very bowles of his
Churches.
And having said thus, they threw themselves before them upon the ground, yelling,
and imploring that they might be reposess'd of their Estates and their Country; and that
their Lordships would take care (seeing their reputation was irrecoverable) that at least
the Wives might be restored to their Husbands, and the Children to their Parents. The
cruelty and inhumanity of his behaviour having been understood before; and now particu|larly
related by the sufferers themselves; wrought so highly upon the Magistrates, that im|mediately
they Commanded Astorre back from the Army, casheir'd him, and made him af|terwards
incapable of any Command. They caus'd inquisition likewise to be made after the
goods of the Saravezesi: such as were found, were restor'd, what could be found, was
repriz'd afterwards by the City, as opportunity was offer'd.
Rinaldo de gli AlbiziRinaldo ac|us'd. was accus'd on the other side for managing the War, not so much
for the publick profit of his Country, as for his own, it was objected against him, that
from the very hour of his Commission, he laid aside all thoughts of reducing Lucca, and de|sign'd
no farther than to plunder the Country, to fill his own pastures with other Peoples

Cattel, and furnish his own houses with other Peoples goods. That his own Bokty and
his Officers being too little to satisfie him, he barter'd and bought the plunder of his com|mon
Soldiers, and, of a General, made himself a Merchant. These calumniations being
come to his ears, netled his honest, but haughty mind, more perhaps than a wise Man
would have suffer'd them to do. However they disturb'd him so, that in a rage both against
Magistrate and City, without expecting, or so much as desiring leave he return'd upon
the spur to Florence, presented himself before the Ten, and told them;
That he now found how difficult and dangerous it was to serve an unconstant People,His Speech to the Ten.
and a divided City; the one entertain'd all reports and believ'd them. The other pu|nish'd
what was amiss, condemn'd what was uncertain, but rewarded nothing that was
done well. So that if you overcome, no body thanks you; if you mistake every body
blames you; if you miscarry every body reproaches you; either your friends persecute
you for emulation, or your Enemies for Malice. However for his part he had never, for
fear of Scandal or imputation, omitted any thing which he judg'd might be of certain ad|vantage
to his Country. But that now indeed the baseness of the calumnies under which
at present he lay, had master'd his patience, and chang'd his whole Nature. Where|fore
he beg'd the Magistrates would for the future be more ready to justifie their officers,
that they might act with more alacrity for the good of their Country. And that seeing
in Florence no Triumph was to be expected, that they at least would concern themselves
so far, as to secure them from obloquy. He admonish'd them likewise to reflect, that
they themselves were officers of the same City, and by consequence every hour lyable to such
slanders as may give them to understand how great trouble and disquiet honest Men conceive
at such false accusations.
The Ten endeavour'd to pacifie him as much as the time would allow, but transfer'd his
command upon Neri di Gino, and Alamanno Salviati, who instead of rambling, and harra|sing
the Country, advanced with their Army, and block'd up the Town. The season be|ing
cold, the Army was lodg'd at Capanole, the new Generals, thinking the time long, had
a mind to be nearer and encamp before the Town, but the Souldier objected the ill weather,
and would not consent, though the Ten sent them positive orders to that purpose, and
would not hear of excuse.
There was at that time resident in Florence, a most excellent Architect call'd Philip, the
the Son of Brunelesco, of whose Workmanship this City is so full, that after his Death he
deserv'd to have his statute set up in Marble in the principal Church of the Town, with an
inscription under it, to testifie his great excellence to the Reader. This Philip upon consi|deration
of the banks of the River Scrchio, and the situation of the Town, had found out a
way to drown it. This invention he imparted to the Ten, and so convinc'd them, that
by their order, experiment was to be made, which was done, but it turn'd more to the pre|judice
of our camp, than to the detriment of the Town. For the Lucchesi perceiving the
design, heighten'd and strengthned their banks one that part where the river was to over|flow,
and afterwards taking their opportunity one night, they brake down the sluice which
was made to turn the water upon them; so that their banks being firm and high, and the
banks towards the plain open, it overflowed their Camp, and forc'd them to remove. This
design miscarrying, the Ten call'd home their Commissioners, and sent Giovanni Guic|cardini
to command the Army in their stead; who clap'd down before the Town,
and straiten'd it immediately. Finding himself distress'd, the Governor of the
Town, upon the incouragement of Antonio dell Rosso, a Sienese (who was with him as
resident from the Town of Sienna) sent Salvestro Trenta and Lodovico Bonvisi to the Duke of
Milan, to desire he would relieve him. Finding him cold in the business, they entreated
him privately that he would at least send them supplies, and promis'd him (from the
People) that as soon as they were arriv'd, they would deliver both Lord and Town into
their hands; assuring him that if this resolution were not suddenly taken, their Lord would
surrender it to the Florentines, who had tempted him with several fair proffers. The fear
of that, made the Duke lay aside all other respects, wherefore he caus'd the Conte Francesco
Sforza his General, publickly to desire leave to march with his forces into the Kingdom
of Naples; and having obtain'd it, he went with his Troops to Lucca, notwithstanding
the Florentines, upon notice of his transaction, sent to the Conte Boccaccinor Alamanni
their friend to prevent it. Francesco having forced his passage into the Town, the Florentines
drew off to Librafatta, and the Conte march'd out, and sat down before Pescia, where Pa|golo
da Diaccetto was Governor, and in great fear ran away to Pistoia. Had not the Town
been better defended by Giovanni Malavolti, than by him, it had been most dishonourably
lost. The Conte, not able to carry it at the first assault, drew off to Buggiano, took that
and Stilano a Castle not far off and burn'd both of them to the ground. The Florentines
displeas'd with this devastation, apply'd themselves to a remedy which had often preserv'd

them, and knowing that Souldiers of Fortune are easier corrupted than beaten they caus'd
a considerable sum to be proffer'd to the Conte, not only to depart, but to deliver them
the Town. The Conte perceiving no Man was to be squeez'd out of that City, accepted
the proposition in part; but not thinking it convenient in point of honor to put them in
possession of the Town, he articled to draw away his Army upon the payment of 50000
Ducats. This agreement being made, that the people of Lucca might excuse him to the
Duke, he seiz'd upon their Governor, which they had promis'd to depose. Antonio dell
Rosso (the Siena Embassador) was at that time in Lucca, as we said before. This Antonio
by the Authority of the Conte, meditated the destruction of Pagolo. The heads of the Con|spiracy
were Pietro Cennami, and Giovanni da Chivizano.
The Conte was quartered out of the Town, upon the Banks of the Serchio, and with
him the Governor's Son. The Conspirators, about 40 in number, went in the night to find
out Pagolo, who hearing of their intention, came forth in great fear to meet them, and in|quire
the occasion. To whom Cennami made answer; That they had been too long Go|vern'd
by him: that the Enemy was now about their walls, and they brought into a neces|sity
of dying either by Famine or the Sword; That for the future they were resolv'd to take
the Government into their own hands,Pagolo Lord of Lucca de|pos'd. and therefore they demanded that the Treasure, and
the Keys of the City might be delivered to them. Pagolo repli'd, that the Treasure was
consum'd; but both the Keys and himself were at their service, only he had no request to
make to them, that as his Government had begun, and continued without blood, so there
might be none spilt at its conclusion. Hereupon Pagolo and his Son were deliver'd up to
the Conte Francesco, who presented them to the Duke, and both of them dyed after|wards
in prison.
This departure of the Conte, having freed the Lucchesi from the Tyranny of their Go|vernor,
and the Florentine from the fear of his Army; both sides fell again to their prepara|tions;
the one to beleaguer, and the other to defend. The Florentines made the Conte
Orbino their General, who begirt the Town so close, the Lucchesi were constrain'd once
more to desire the assistance of the Duke, who under the same pretence as he had formerly
sent the Conte, sent Nicolo Piccinino to relieve them. Piccinino advancing with his Troops
to enter the Town, the Florentines opposing his passage over the River, the Florentines
were defeated after a sharp ingagement, and the General with very few of his Forces, pre|serv'd
themselves at Pisa. This disaster put the whole City in great consternation; and
because the enterprize had been undertaken upon the peoples account,The Floren|tines defeated. not knowing where
else to direct their complaints, they laid the fault upon the Officers and managers, seeing
they could not fix it upon the contrivers of the war; and reviv'd their old articles against
Rinaldo. But the greatest part of their indignation fell upon Giovanni Guiccardini; charg|ing
him that it was in his power to have put an end to the war, after Conte Francesco was
departed; but that he had been corrupted by their mony; part of which had been remitted
to his own house by bills of exchange; and part he had received himself, and carryed it
with him. These reports and rumors went so high, that the Captain of the people, mo|ved
by them, and the importunity of the contrary party, summon'd him before him, Gio|vanni
appear'd, but full of indignation, whereupon his relations interpos'd, and to their
great honor, prevail'd so far with the Captain, that the process was laid aside. The Luc|chesi
upon this Victory, not only recover'd their own Towns, but over-ran, and possess'd
themselves of the whole Territory of Pisa, except Biantina, Calcinaia, Liccorno, and Li|brafatta;
and (had not a conspiracy been accidently discover'd in Pisa) that City had
been lost among the rest. The Florentines however recruited their Army, and sent it out
under the command of Micheletto, who had been bred up a Soldier under Sforza.
The Duke having obtain'd the Victory, to overlay the Florentines, with multitude of
Enemies, procured a League betwixt the Genouesi, Sanisi, and the Lord of Piombino, for
the defence of Lucca; and that Piccinino should be their General, which thing alone was
the discovery of the plot. Hereupon the Venetians and Florentines renew there League.
Open Hostilities are committed both in Lombardy and Tuscany; and many Skirmishes and
Rencounters happen with various fortune on both sides; till at length every Body being
tyr'd,1433. a General Peace was concluded betwixt all parties in the month of May 1433. by
which it was agreed that the Florentines, Siennesi, Lucchesi and who ever else during that
war had taken any Towns or Castles from their Enemies,Peace be|twixt the Flo|rentines and Lucchesi. should restore them, and all
things return to the possession of the owners. During the time of this war abroad, the ma|lignant
and factious humors began to work again and ferment at home; and Cosimo de Me|dici
after the Death of his Father, began to manage the publick business with greater
intention and magnanimity; and converse with his Friends with greater freedom
than his Father had done. Insomuch that those who before were glad at the death of

Giovanni. were much surpriz'd and confounded, to see him so far out-done by his Son.
Cosimo was a wise and sagacious Gentleman, grave, but grateful in his presence; liberal, and
courteous to the highest; never attempted any thing against any party, nor the State, but
watch'd all opportunities of doing good to every Body, and obliging all people with his
continual beneficence. So that indeed the excellency of his conversation, was no little distra|ction
and disadvantage to those who were at the helm. However, by that way he presum'd
he should be lyable to live as freely, and with as much Authority, in Florence, as other
people: or else being driven to any strait by the malice of his Adversaries, it would be in
his power to deal with them, by the assistance of his friends. The great instruments for
the propagation of his interest were Averardo de Medici, and Puccio Pucci, Averardo with
his prudence procuring him much favour and reputation. This Puccio was a Person so e|minent
for his judgment, and so well known to the people, that he denominated the
faction, which was not call'd Cosimo's, but Puccio's Party, The City was divided in this
manner at that time, when the enterprize was taken against Lucca; during which the ill
humors, were rather provok'd, and incens'd than extinguish'd. And although Puccio's
Party were the great promoters of it at first, yet afterwards in the prosecution of it many
of the contrary party were imploy'd, as Men of more reputation in the State. Which be|ing
above the power of Averardo de Medici, and his comrades to prevent, he set him|self
with all possible Art to calumniat those Officers; and upon any misfortune (and no
great thing can be managed without it) all was imputed rather to their imprudence and ill
conduct, than to the Virtue of their Enemies. He it was that aggravated his Enormities
so strongly against Astorre Gianni. He it was disgusted Rinaldo de gli Albizi, and caus'd
him to desert his Command without leave. He it was which caus'd the Captain of
the people to cite Guiccardini before him. From him it was, all the other aspersions
which were laid upon the Magistrates and the Generals, did proceed. He aggravated
what was true; he invented what was false; and what was true, and what was false where
readily believ'd by those who hated them before.
These unjust and irregular ways of proceeding were well known to Nicolo Uzano, and
other heads of that Party. They had many times consulted how they might remedy them
but could never pitch upon a way. To suffer them to encrease, they were sensible would be
dangerous; and to endeavour to suppress them, they knew would be difficult. Nicolo da
Uzano was the first Man that expos'd his disgust; but observing the war to be continued
without, and the distractions encreasing at home; Nicolo Barbadori, desirous of Uzano's
concurrence to the destruction of Cosimo, went to seek him at his house, and finding him a|lone
very pensive in his study, he persuaded him with the best arguments he could use, to
joyn with Rinaldo in the expulsion of Cosimo, to whome Nicolo da UzanoNicolo da Uzano's an|swer to Barba|dori. repli'd in these
Words.
It were better for your self, for your Family and the whole Common-wealth, if both
you and your whole party, had their beards (as they say you have) rather of Silver than
Gold. Their Counsels then, proceeding from Heads that were gray, and repleat with
experience, would be fuller of Wisdom, and advantage to the Publick. Those who de|sign
to drive Cosimo out of Florence, ought first to consider his interest with their own.
Our Party you have christen'd the party of the Nobility, and the contrary faction, is
call'd the faction of the people. Did the truth of the matter correspond with the Name,
yet in all adventures the victory would be doubtful, and we ought in discretion rather to
fear than presume, when we remember the Condition of the Ancient Nobility of this Ci|ty,
which have not only been depress'd, but extinguish'd by the people. But we are un|der
greater discouragments than that, our Party is divided, theirs is entire. In the first
place Neri de Gino, and Nerone de Nigi (two of the Principal of our City) have not
declar'd themselves as yet; so that it remains uncertain which side they will take. There
are several houses and families divided among themselves. Many out of a pick to
their Brothers, or some other of their Relations, have abandon'd, us, and betaken
to them. I shall instance in some of the chief, and leave the rest to your private con|sideration.
Of the Sons of Maso de gli Albizi; Lucca, out of animosity to Rinal|do,
has engag'd himself on the other side: in the Family of the Guiccardini, among
the Sons of Luigi, Piero is an Enemy to his Brother Giovanni, and sides with our ad|versaries.
Tomaso and Nicolo Soderini, in opposition to Francesco, their Unckle, are ma|nifestly
defected. So that if it be seriously deliberated, who are on their side, and who
are on ours, I know no reason why ours should be call'd the faction of the Nobility more
than theirs. And if it be alledg'd, that the people are all on their side; so much is
ours the worse; for when ever we come to blows, we shall not be able to oppose them.
If we insist upon our dignity, it was given us at first, and has been continued to us

for fifty years by this State; and if now we should discover our weakness, we should
certainly lose it. If you pretend the justice of our cause, and that that will give us repu|tation,
and detract from our Enemies;
I answer, it is fit that justice should be known and believ'd by other people, as well
as our selves; which is quite contrary, the whole cause of our present Commotion be|ing
founded upon a bare suspicion, that Cosimo would usurp, and make himself Soveraign,
of our City. Though this suspicion passes among us, it does not with other people
who accuse us, even for our accusation of him. Examine the crimes upon which we
ground our suspicion; what are they, but that he distributes his mony freely, according
to every Mans necessity; and that not only upon a private, but publick account, not on|ly
to the Florentines, but to the foreign Commanders: that he favour this or that Citi|zen
which desires to be a Magistrate; that by the general reputation he has among all
People, he advances this, or that, of his friends to employments as he sees occasion: so
that the whole weight and strength of his impeachment, lyes in this; that he is charitable,
liberal; ready to his friend; and belov'd by all People. Tell me I beseech you what
Law is it that prohibits, that blames, and condemns beneficence, or love? 'Tis true,
these are ways by which Men aspire and do many times arrive at the Supremacy; but
they are not thought so by other People; nor are we sufficient to obtrude them; because
our own ways have defam'd us; and the City (having lived always in faction) is be|come
corrupt and partial, and will never regard our accusations. But admit you succeed
and should prevail so far as to banish him (which truly if the Senate concur might be
done without difficulty (how can you think among so many of his friends as will be left
behind, and labour incessantly for his return, to obviate or prevent it? Certainly it will
be impossible, his interest is so great, and himself so universally belov'd, you can never
secure him. If you go about to banish the chief of those who discover themselves to be his
friends, you do but multiply your adversaries, and create more Enemies to your self: re|turn
he will, in a very short time, and then you have gain'd only this point, to have ba|nish'd
a good Man, and readmitted a bad: for you must expect he will be exasperated,
his Nature debauch'd by those who call him back; and being oblig'd to them so highly
it will be no prudence in him to reject them. If your design be to put him to Death for|mally,
by the cooperation of the Magistrate; that is not to be done; his wealth, and your
corruption will preserve him. But admit he should die, or being banish'd never return,
I do not see what advantage will accure to our state. If it be deliver'd from Cosimo, it
will be in the same danger of Rinaldo; and I am of their number who would have no
Citizen exceed another in Authority. If either of them prevail (as one of them must)
I know not what obligation I have to favour Rinaldo more than Cosimo. I will say no
more, than God deliver this City from private usurpation, and (when our sins do de|serve
it) particularly from his. Do not therefore persuade to a thing that is every way
so dangerous; do not fancy that by the assistance of a few, you can oppose against a mul|titude:
all the Citizens you converse with, partly by ignorance, and partly by malice, are
dispos'd to sell their Country; and fortune is so favourable as to have presented them a
Chapman. Manage your self therefore by my Counsel for once; live quietly, and observe,
and (as to your liberty) you will have as much reason to be jealous of your own party,
as the adverse. When troubles do happen, let me advise you to be a Neuter; by it you
will stand fair with both sides, and preserve your self, without prejudice to your
Country
These words rebated the edge of Barbadoro's fury; and all things remain'd peaceable
during the war with Lucca. But peace being concluded, and Uzano deceased, the City
was left without wars abroad, or Government at home; every Man driving on his own
pernicious designs; and Rinaldo (looking upon himself was now as Chief of the Party)
press'd and importun'd all such Citizens as he thought capable of being Gonfalonieri, to
take Arms and wrest their Country out of the jaws of a person, who by the malice of a
few, and the ignorance of the multitude, would otherwise inevitably enslave it. These
Plots and counter-plots, on Rinaldo's side, and his Adversaries kept the City in a perpetual
jealouse; Insomuch that at the creation of every Magistrate it was publickly declar'd how
every Man stood affected both to the one faction and the other; and at the election of Sena|tors,
the whole City was in an uproar: every thing that was brought before the Magi|strate
(how inconsiderable and trifling so ever) created a mutiny: all secrets were dis|cover'd:
nothing was so good, or so evil, but it had its favourers and opposers; the good as
well as the bad were equally traduc'd, and no one Magistrate, did execute his Office.
Florence remaining in this confusion; and Rinaldo impatient to depress the Authority of
Cosimo: considering with himself that Bernardo Guadagni (were it not for his arreers to

the Publick) was a fit Person to be chosen Gonfaloniere; to qualifie him for that Office, he
discharg'd them himself. And coming afterwards to a Scrutiny, it fell out that Fortune
(which has been always a friend to our disorders) made Bernardo Gonfaloniere for the Months
of September and October. Rinaldo visited him forthwith, and told him that the Nobility,
and all People that desir'd to live happily, were much rejoyced at his preferment; and that
it was now his business to carry himself so as they might never repent it: he laid before him
the danger of dividing among themselves; and how nothing could contribute so much to
their Union, as the depression of Cosimo; for he was the Man, and no other, who kept
them down, by the immensity of his treasure, and rais'd up himself so high, that without
timely prevention he would make himself Soveraign. That (as he was a good Citizen)
it was his Office to provide against it, by assembling the People in the Piazza; taking the
State into his protection; and restoring its liberty to its Country: he put him in mind that
Salvestro de Medici could (though unjustly) curb and correct the Authority of the Guelfs,
to whom (if for no other reason but for the Blood which their Ancestors lost in that quar|rel)
the Government belong'd; and what he did unjustly against so many, Bernardo might
do justly, and therefore safely against one. He encourag'd him not to fear: for his friends
would be ready to assist him, with their Arms in their hands. The People that were his
creatures, were not to be regarded, for no more assistance was to be expected by Cosimo
from them, than they had formerly yeilded to Giorgio Scali. His riches was not to be
dreaded; for, when seiz'd by the Senate, his wealth would be theirs, and for conclusion he
told him, that in doing thus, he would unite and secure the Common-wealth, and make
himself glorious. Bernardo reply'd in short, that he believ'd what he said to be not only true
but necessary: and that time being now fitter for action than discourse, he should go and pro|vide
what force he could, that it might appear he had companions in his Enterprize. As
soon as he was in possession of his Office; had dispos'd his Companies, and setled all things
with Rinaldo, he cited Cosimo, who (though dissuaded by most of his friends) appeared
presuming more upon his own innocence, than the Mercy of his Judges. Cosimo was no
sooner enter'd into the Palace, and secur'd; but Rinaldo with all his servants in Arms,
and his whole party at his heels, came into the Piazza, where the Senators causing the
people to be cal'd, 200 Citizens were selected to constitute a Balia reformation of the
State. This Balia was no sooner in force, but the first thing they fell upon in order to their
reformation, was the process against Cosimo; many would have him banish'd; many exe|cuted;
and many were silent, either out of compassion for him, or apprehension of other
people; by means of which non-concurrence, nothing was concluded. In one of the
Towers of the Palace (call'd Alberghettino) Cosimo was a Prisoner in the Custody of Fe|derigo
Malavolti. From this place Cosimo could hear and understand what was said; and
hearing the clutter of Arms, and frequent calling out to the Balia, he began to be fearful of
his Life, but more, lest he should be assassinated by his particular Enemies. In this terror
he absteen'd from his meat, and eat nothing in four days but a morsel of Bread. Which be|ing
told to Federigo, he accosted him thus.
You are afraid to be poison'd,Federig's speech to Cosi|mo his Priso|ner. and you kill your self with hunger. You have but small
esteem for me, to believe I would have a hand in any such wickedness: I do not think your
Life is in danger, your friends are too unmerous both within the Palace, and without: if there
be any such designs, assure your self they must take new measures; I will never be their in|strument,
nor imbrue my hands in the Blood of any Man, much less of yours, who has never
offended me: courage then; feed as you did formerly, and keep your self alive for the good of
your Country and friends, and that you may feed with more confidence, I my self will be your
Taster.
These words reviv'd Cosimo exceedingly: who with tears in his Eyes kissing and embrace|ing
Federigo, in most pathetical and passionate terms he thank'd him for his humanity; and
promis'd him reward, if ever his fortune gave him opportunity: Cosimo being by this
means in some kind of repose; and his business and condition in dispute among the Citi|zens;
to entertain Cosimo Federigo brought home with him one night to Supper, a Servant
of the Gonfaloniere's call'd Fargannaccio, a pleasant Man, and very good company. Sup|per
being almost done, Cosimo (hoping to make advantage by his being there, having known
him before very well) made a sign to Federigo to go out; who apprehending his mean|ing,
pretended to give order for something that was wanting, and went forth. After
some few preliminary words when they were alone, Cosimo gave Fargannaccio a token to
the Master of the Hospital of S. Maria Nuova for 1100 Ducates, a thousand of them to be
deliver'd to the Gonfaloniere, and the odd hundred for himself. Forgannaccio undertook to
deliver them; the Money was paid; and the Gonfaloniere was desir'd to take some oppor|tunity
of visiting Cosimo himself. Upon the receipt of this sum, Bernardo became more

moderate, and Coimo was only confin'd to Padua, though Rinaldo design'd against
his Life. Besides Cosimo Averardo, and several others of the Medici were imprison'd
and among the rest Puccio, and Giovanni Pucci. For greater terrour to such as
were dissatisfied with the Banishment of Cosimo, the Balia was reduc'd to the eight
of the Guards,Cosimo ba|nished. and the Captain of the people. Upon which resolution, Cosimo being
conveen'd before the Senate the 3 of October 1433, received the sentence of Banish|ment;
with exhortation to submit, unless he intended they should proceed more se|verely
both against his Person and Estate. Cosimo received his sentence very chearful|ly.
He assur'd them, that honorable convention could not order him to any place,
to which he would not willingly repair.1433. He desir'd of them, that since they had not
thought fit to take away his Life, they would vouchsafe to secure it, for he under|stood
there were many in the Piazza who attended to kill him; and at length he
protested that in what ever place or condition he should be, himself and his Estate
should be always at the service of that City, Senate, and people. The Gonfaloniere,
bad him be satisfied; kept him in the palace till night; convey'd him than to his
own house; and having supped with him delivered him to a guard to be conducted
safely to the Frontiers. Whereever he pass'd, Cosimo was honorably receiv'd; vi|sited
publickly by the Venetians; and treated by them more like a Soveraign than a
Prisoner, Florence being in this manner deprived of a Citizen so universally belov'd, every
Body was dismay'd, as well they who prevail'd, as they who were over-power'd. Where|upon
Rinaldo, foreseeing his Fate, that he might not be deficient to himself, or his party,
call'd his Friends together, and told them.
That he now saw very evidently their destruction was at hand;Rinaldo's speech to his Friends. that they had suffer'd
themselves to be overcome by the intreaties, and tears, and bribes of their Enemies, not
considering that ere long it would be their turns to weep, and implore, when their Prayers
would not be heard, nor their tears find any compassion; and for the mony they had received,
not only the principal would be required, but interest extorted with all possible cruelty. That
they had much better have died themselves, than Cosimo should have escap'd with his Life,
and his friends be continued in Florence. Great Men should never be provok'd: when they
are, there is no going back. That now there appear'd no remedy to him, but to fortifie in the
City; which our Enemies opposing (as doubtless they will) we may take our advantage
and banish them by force, since we cannot by Law. That the result of all this would be
no more (than what he had inculcated before) the restauration of the Nobility; the resti|tution
of their honors and Officers in the City; and the corroboration of their party with
them, as the adversary had strengthened his with the People. And that by this means,
their party would be made more strong by assuming more courage and Vigor, and by ac|quiring
more credit and reputation. At last supperadding, that if these remedies were not
apply'd in time, he could not see which way, amidst so many Enemies, the State was to
be preserv'd, and he could not but foresee the City and their whole party would be de|stroy'd.
To this, Mariotto Boldovinetti oppos'd himself, alledging the haughtiness of the Nobi|lity,
and their insupportable Pride; and that it was not prudence in them to run themselves
under a certain Tyranny, to avoid the uncertain dangers of the People. Rinaldo perceiving
his Counsel not likely to take, complain'd of his misfortune, and the misfortune of his
party; imputing all to the malignity of their stars, rather then to the blindness and inex|perience
of the Men. Whilst things were in this suspense, and no necessary provision made,
a letter was discover'd from Agnalo Accinivoli to Cosimo, importing the affections of the
City towards him, and advising him to stir up some War or other, and make Neri de Gino
his friend, for he did presage the City would want Mony, and no Body being found to
supply them, it might put the Citizens in mind of him, and perhaps prevail with them to
solicite his return: and if Neri should be taken off from Rinaldo, his party would be left
too weak to defend him. This letter coming into the hands of the Senate, was the occasi|on
that Agnolo was secur'd, examin'd, and sent into banishment; and yet his example
could not at all deter such as were Cosimo's friends. The year was almost come about since
Cosimo was banished; and about the latter end of August 1434, Nicolo di Croco was drawn
Gonfaloniere for the next two months, and with him eight new Senators chosen of Cosmo's
Party.
So that that election frighted Rinaldo and his friends. And because by Custom it
was three days after their election before the Senators were admitted to the execution of
their office, Rinaldo address'd himself again to the heads of his Party, and remonstrated to
them the danger that was hanging over their heads: that the only remedy left them was
immediately to take Arms, to cause Donati Velluti (who was Gonfloniere at that time)

to erect a new Balia: to degrade the new Senators; to create others (for their turns)
in their places: to burn the old, and fill up the next imborsation with the names of their
friends: this resolution was by some people held necessary and good, but by others it was
thought too viole, and that which would draw very ill consequences after it. Among
the number of dissenters Palla Strozzi was one; who being a quiet, gentle, and courteous
Person, apter for study, than the restraining of factions, or opposing civil dissentions re|ply'd
that all enterprizes that are contri'd with the least shadow of wisdom, or Courage,
seem good at first, but prove difficult in the execution, and destructive in the end. That
he had thought (the Dukes Army being upon their frontiers in Romagna) the apprehen|sion
of new War abroad, would have imploy'd the thoughts of the Senate, better than the
differences at home. That if it should appear they design'd an alteration of the Govern|ment
(which could hardly be conceal'd) the people would always have time enough
to get to their Arms, and perform what was necessary for their Common defence;
which being done of necessity, would not carry with it either so much wonder, or
reproach.
Upon these considerations it was resolv'd, that the new Senators should be permitted
to enter; but such an eye to be had to their proceedings, that upon the least injury,
or reflection upon their party, they should unanimously take Arms and rendezvous at
the Piazza of St. Pulinare, from whence (being not far from the Palace) they might
dispose of themselves as their advantage directed. This being the result of that meet|ing,
the new Senators entred upon the Office; and the Gonfaloniere, to give him|self
a reputation, and to render himself formidable to his Enemies, caus'd his pre|decessor
Donato Velluti to be clap'd in Prison, as a Person who had embezled the
publick treasure: after this, he felt, and sounded his Brethren about Cosimo's re|turn;
and inding them dispos'd, he communicated with such as he thought the
heads of the Medici's party, who encouraging him likewise, he cited Rinaldo Ri|dolfo
Peruzzi, and Nicolo Barbadori, as the Principals of the contrary faction. Upon
this citation, Rinaldo concluding it no time longer to protract, issued forth from his
house with a considerable number of Arm'd Men, and joyn'd himself with Ridolfo
Peruzzi and Nicolo Barbadori, immediately: there were among them several other Ci|tizens,
besides a good number of Souldiers (which being out of pay were at that
time in Florence) and all drew up (as was before agreed) at the Piazza di St. Pu|linare.
Palla Srozzi though he had got good store of people together, stir'd not
out of his House, and Giovanni Guiccardini did the same; whereupon Rinaldo sent
to remember them of the engagement, and to reprehend their delay: Giovanni re|ply,d,
that he should do disservice enough to the Enemy, if by keeping his house, he
prevented his Brother Piero's going forth to the relief of the Senate. Palla, after
much solicitation, and several messages, came on Horseback to St. Pulinare, but unarm'd
and with only two footmen at his heels. Rinaldo perceiving him, advanc'd to meet
him; upbraided him with his negligence, and told him that his not joyning with the
rest, proceeded from the want of idelity or courage; either of which was unworthy
a person of his quality or rank. That if he thought by not doing his duty against
the other faction, he should save his own stake, and escape with his liberty and Life;
he should find himself mistaken. That for his own part, if things happen'd adversly
he should have this consolation, that he was not backward with his advice before the dan|ger;
nor in it with his Power: Whereas he and his Comerads could not without hor|ror
remember that this was the third time they had betraid their Country. First, when
they preserv'd Cosimo; the next, when they rejected his Counsels; and the third then,
in not assisting with their supplies; to which Palla made no answer that the standers
by could understand but muttering to himself, he fac'd about with his Horse, and
returned from whence he came.
The  perceiving Rinaldo and his party in Arms, and themselves utterly de|serted,
they caus'd the Gates of the Palace to be barracado'd up, as not knowing what
else was to be done. But Rinaldo neglecting his opportunity of marching into the Piazza,
by attending supplies which never came to him, depriv'd himself of his advantage;
gave them courage to provide for their defence and to several other Citizens to re|pair
to them, both with their Persons, and advice. In the mean time, some friends
of the Senators which were least suspected went to Rinaldo and acquainted him, that
the Senate could not imagine the reason of this commotion: that if it was about the
business of Cosimo they had no thoughts of recalling him. That they never had any
inclination to offend him; i these were the grounds of their jealousie, they, might

assure themselves if they pleas'd; come into the Palace, be civilly received, and rea|dily
gratified in their demands. But fair words would not down with Rinaldo, who
told them that the way he had prepos'd to assure himself, was by reducing the Sena|tors
to their private Condition; and reforming the City to the benefit of all Peo|ple.
But it seldom happens that any thing is well done where there is equality in
Power, and difference in judgment.
Ridolfo Peruzzi (moved with what the Citizens had said) told them that for his part
he ask'd no more but that Cosimo might be kept out: that if that were granted, he
had his designs: that he would not fill the City with Blood, nor impose upon the
Senate; that he was ready to obey them if they pleas'd, and according he marched
with all his followers into the Palace, and was joyfully received. Rinaldo's staying at St.
Pullnare; pusillanimity of Palla, and Ridolfo's revolt defeated Rinaldo of his victory
and rebated much of the first edge and vigor of his Party: with all which, the Popes
Authority concur'd.Eugenius the Pope labours a peace, Pope Eugenius, being driven out of Rome by the people, was
at that time resident in Florence; who understanding the tumult; and judging it
incumbent upon his office (if possible) to appease it, he sent Giovanni Vitelleschi
(a Patriarch and great friend of Rinaldo's) to desire he might speak with him,
for he had authority and interest enough with the Senate to secure and content him,
without Blood shed, or other detriment of the Citizens: upon the persuasion of his
friend, Rinaldo with all his Squadron march'd to St. Maria Novella where the
Pope lay. Eugenius let him know the promise the Senate had made him to com|mit
all differences to his determination; and that (when their Arms were laid down)
all things should be ordered, as he pleas'd to award. Rinaldo observing the cold|ness
of Palla; and the inconstancy of Peruzzi, and having no more cards to play,
cast himself into his Holiness his Arms, not doubting but his interest was sufficient
to protect him.Cosimo recall'd
Hereupon by the Popes direction notice was given to Nicolo Barbadori and the
rest which attended Rinaldo without, that they should go home and lay down their
Arms, for Rinaldo was in treaty with him about a Peace with the Senate; upon which
news they all disbanded, and laid down their Arms. The Senate continued their
Treaty by the mediation of the Pope; but in the mean time sent privately into
the Mountains of Pistoria to raise foot, and causing them to joyn with their own forces
and march into Florence in the night, they possess'd themselves of all the Posts in
the City; call'd the people together into the Palace; eted a new Balia; which
the first time they met, recall'd Cosimo, and all that were bnish'd with him. And on
the contrary faction, they banishd Rinaldo de gli Albizi, Ridolfo Peruzzi, Nicolo
Barbadori, Palla Strozzi, and so great a number of other Citizens, that there was
scarce a Town in Italy but had some of their exiles, besides several which were
banish'd into foreign Countries. So by this and such accidents as these, Florence
was impoverish'd in its wealth and industry, as well as inhabitants. The Pope
beholding the destruction of those Men who by his intercession had laid down their
Arms, was much troubled, complained heavily to Rinaldo of their violence, exhort|ed
him to patience, and to expect submissively till his fortune should turn. To
whom Rinaldo made this answer.
The smal confidence they had in me, who ought to have beleiv'd me, and the
too great conidence I had in you,Rinaldo's answer to the Pop. has been the ruine of me and my party. But
I hold my self more culpable than any body, for believing that you who had been
driven out of your own Country, could keep me in mine. Of the vicissitudes, and
uncertainty of fortune, I have had experience enough. I have never presum'd in its
prosperity, and adversity shall never deject me; knowing that when she pleases
she can take about and indulge me: if she continues her severity, and never smiles
upon me more, I shall not much value it, esteeming no great happiness to live
in a City where the Laws are of less authority, than the passions of particular
men. For might I have my choice, that should be my Country where I may secure|ly
enjoy my fortune and friends; not that where the first is easily sequester'd, and
the latter to preserve his own Estate, will forsake me in my greatest necessity. To
wise and good men 'tis always less ungrateful to hear at a distance, than to be a
spectator of the miseries of his Country; and more honorable they think to be an
honest Rebel, than a servile Citizen.
Having said thus, he tooke his leave of the Pope, and complaining often to himself
of his own Counsels, and the cowardice of his friends, in great indignation he left the

City, and went into banishment. On the otherside, Cosimo having notice of his restau|ration;
return'd to Florence, where he was received with no less ostentation and tri|umph,
than if he had obtain'd some extraordinary Victory; so great was the concourse
of people, and so high the demonstration of their joy, that by an unanimous and uni|versal
concurrence he was saluted, The Benefactor of the people, and the Father of their
Country.



THE
HISTORY
OF
FLORENCE.
Book V.
GOvernments in the variations which most commonly happen to them, do pro|ceed
from order to confusion, and that confusion afterwards turns to order
again. For Nature having fixed no sublunary things, as soon as they arrive
at their achme and perfection, being capable of no further ascent, of necessity
they decline. So, on the other side, when they are reduced to the lowest pitch of disorder
having no farther to descend, they recoil again to their former perfection: good Laws de|generating
into bad customs, and bad customs ingendring good Laws. For, virtue begets
peace; peace begets idleness; idleness, mutiny; and mutiny, destruction: and then vice
versa; that ruine begets Laws; those Laws, virtue; and virtue begets honour and good suc|cess.
Hence it is, as wise men have observed, that Learning is not so ancient as Arms; and
that in all Provinces as well as Cities, there were Captains before Philosophers, and Soul|diers
before Scholars. For good and well conducted Arms having gotten the victory at
first, and that victory, quiet. The courage and magnanimity of the Souldier could not be
depraved with a more honourable sort of idleness, than the desire of learning; nor could
idleness be introduced into any well-governed City by a more bewitching and insinuating
way. This was manifest to Cato (when Diogenes and Carneades the Philosophers were
sent Embassadors, from Athens, to the Senate) who observing the Roman youth to be much
taken with their doctrine, and following them up and down with great admiration; fore|seeing
the ill consequences that honest laziness would bring upon his Country: he obtain'd
a Law, that no Philosopher should be admitted into Rome. All Governments therefore do,
by these means, some time or other come to decay; and when once at the lowest, and mens
sufferings have made them wiser, they rebound again, and return to their first order unless
they be supprest, and kept under by some extraordinary force.
These vicissitudes and revolutions (first by means of the Tuscans, and then of the Romans)
kept Italy unsettled, and rendered it sometimes happy, and sometimes miserable: and al|though
nothing was afterwards erected out of the Roman ruines, comparable to what was
before; (which nevertheless might have been done with great glory under a virtuous Prince)
yet in some of the new Cities and Governments, such sprouts of Roman virtue sprung up;
that though they did not usurp upon one another, yet they lived so amicably and orderly
together, that they not only defended themselves, but repelled the Barbarians.
Among these Governments was the Florentine, though perhaps inferior in circumference

of territory, yet in power and authority equal to any of them: for being seated in the heart
of Italy, rich, and ready upon all occasions, they defended themselves bravely when ever
they were invaded, or brought the victory to their allies, where-ever they sided.
If therefore by reason of the courage of those new Principalities, the times were not
altogether quiet; yet the severity of the War did not make them insupportable. For that
cannot be called Peace, where the Governments clash, and invade one another; nor that
War, in which no men are slain, no Towns pillaged, nor no Government destroyed. The
Wars of those times were begun without fear; carried on without danger; and concluded
without detriment. Insomuch, that that virtue which used to be extinguisht in other Provin|ces,
by means of a long peace, was spent and exhausted in Italy by the faintness of the war,
as will be more conspicuous by our description of the occurrences betwixt 1434 and 1494.
In which it will appear how, at length, a new way was opened to the excursions of the
Barbarians; and Italy relapsed into its old servitude and bondage. And if the actions of
our Governors, both at home and abroad, be not to be read (as the actions of our Ance|stors)
with so much wonder and admiration of their courage and grandeur. Yet, in other
respects they may seem as considerable, seeing how many Noble and great people have
been restrained, and kept under by their Arms, how weak and ill managed however. And
though, in our description we make no mention of the fortitude of the Souldier, the con|duct
of the Captains, nor the love of the Citizen towards his Country; yet we shall disco|ver
what cheats, what cunning, and what arts were used by both Princes, Souldiers, and
Citizens, to preserve a reputation which they never deserved. And this perhaps may be as
worthy our knowledg, as the wisdom and conduct of old; for if the examples of Anti|quity
do teach us what to follow; our more modern transactions will tell us what to
avoid.
Italy, by those who commanded it, was reduced into such a condition, that when by
agreements of the Princes, a Peace was made up, it was presently interrupted by those who
had Arms in their hands: so that they neither gained honour by their Wars, nor quiet by
their Peace. A Peace being concluded betwixt the Duke of Milan and the League in the
year 1433, the Soldiers unwilling to disband, turned the War upon the Church. These
Souldiers were at that time of two Factions,1433. The Souldi|ers in Italy di|stinguished in|to two parties. the Braccescan, and the Sforzescan Faction. Of
this latter, Conte Francesco, the son of Sforza, was Captain; the first was commanded by
Nicolo Piccinino and, Nicolo Forte Braccio. To these two parties all the rest of the Souldiers
in Italy joyned themselves. Of the two, Sforza's party was most considerable, as well for
the courage of their Conte,The Duke of Milan promi|ses his Daugh|ter to Conte Fran. Sforza. as for a promise the Duke of Milan had made him, to give him in
Marriage a natural daughter of his called Madona Bianca; the probability of which alliance
gained him great reputation. After the Peace of Lombardy was concluded; both these
parties, upon several pretended occasions, turned their Arms against Eugenius the Pope.
Nicolo Forte Braccio, was moved by an old animosity Braccio had always retained to the
Church. The Conte was spurr'd on by his ambition. Nicolo assaulted Rome, and the Conte
possessed himself of la Marca; whereupon, the Romans (to evade the War) turned Eu|genius
out of Rome,The Pope invaded, makes peace with Fran. Sforza. who fled to Florence, though with no little danger and difficulty. Be|ing
arrived there, upon consideration of the danger he was in, and that he was deserted by
all the Princes, who reused, upon his score, to take up those Arms again, which so lately,
and so willingly they laid down; made his Peace with the Conte, and gave him the Sig|norie
of la Marca, though the Conte had added insolence to his usurpation, and, in his Let|ters
to his Agents, dated them in Latin (as they do frequently in Italy Ex Girifalco nostro
Firmiano, invito Petro  Paulo. But not contented with the Grant of that Country, he
would needs be created Gonfaloniere of the Church, and the Pope condescended; so much
id his Holiness perfer an ignominious Peace before dangerous War. The Conte, upon
these terms, became a friend to the Pope, and converted his Arms against Nicolo Forte
Braccio; betwixt whom, for many Months together, several accidents happened in the ter|ritory
of the Church; so that which side soever prevailed, the Pope and his Subjects
suffered more than those that managed the War. At length, by the mediation
of the Duke of Milan, an agreement (in the nature of a Truce) was concluded betwixt
them, by which both of them remained Masters of several Towns in the Patrimony of the
Church. The War was in this manner extinguished in Rome, but it brake out again pre|sently
in Romagna,Wars in Ro|magna. by the means of Battista da Canneto, who had caused cer|tain
of the Family of the Grifoni in Bologna to be assassinated; and drove out the Pope's
Governor, and many others which he suspected to be his enemies; to keep by force, what
he had got by surprize, he address'd himself to Philippo for aid: and the Pope to counter|mine
him, and revenge the injuries he had received, applied to the Venetian and Florentine.
Both parties being supplied, there were two great Armies in Romagna of a sudden. Philp's

Auxiliaries were commanded by Nicolo Piccinino. The Venetian and Florentine, by Gatta|melata,
and Nicolo da Tolentino. Not far from Imola they came to a Battel, in which the
Venetians and Florentines were defeated; and Nicolo da Tolentino sent Prisoner to the Duke,
where he died in a few days, either by Poison or grief. The Duke being either impoverished
by the War, or apprehending this Victory would quiet the League, followed not his ad|vantage,
but gave the Pope and his Confederates opportunity to recruit; who choosing the
Conte Francesco for their General,Fran Sforza General of the Pope's Leage they sent him to drive Forte Braccio out of the Lands of
the Church; and to try if they could put an end to that War which they had begun in fa|vour
of the Pope. The Romans seeing his Holiness in the field again, and his Army con|siderable;
they desired to be reconciled; and, having concluded the terms, they received a
Governor from him. Among other Towns, Nicolo Forte Braccio had possessed himself of
Fiboli, Montefiasconi, the City of Castello, and Ascesi: not being able to keep the field, Nicolo
was retreated into this latter Town, and besieged by the Conte. The siege proving long,
by the braveness of Nicolo's defence, the Duke began to cast about, and consider, he must
either hinder the League from carrying the Town, or look to himself as soon as it was ta|ken.
To give the Conte therefore diversion, he commanded Nicolo Piccinino, by the way
to Romagna, to pass into Tuscany: whereupon, the League judging the defence of Tuscany
of more importance than the reducing of Ascesi, they sent to the Conte to stop Piccinino's
passage, who was at that time with his Army at Furli. Upon these orders the Conte raised
his siege, and marched with his Forces to Cesena having, left the War of la Marca, and the
care of his own affairs to the management of his Brother Lione. Whilst Piccinino was la|bouring
to pass, and Francesco to obstruct him, Nicolo Forte Braccio fell upon Lione, and
with great honour to himself, took him Prisoner, plundered his people, and following his
blow, took several Towns in la Marca at the same excursion. This news was very unwel|come
to the Conte, who gave all his own Country for lost; nevertheless, leaving part of
his Army to confront Piccinino he marched himself against Forte Braccio with the rest, forc'd
him to an engagement, and beat him. In which defeat Forte Braccio was hurt, taken
prisoner, and died of his wounds.
This Victory recovered all that Nicolo Forte Braccio had taken from him; and forced the
Duke of Milan to desire a peace,Peace betwixt the League and the Duke which he obtained by the mediation of Nicolo da Esti,
Marqeuss of Ferrara, by which it was agreed, that the Towns which the Duke had got in
Romagna should be restored; and his Forces withdrawn into Lombardy; and Battista da
Caneto (as it happens to those who owe their dominion to the courage or power of other
people) as soon as the Duke's Forces were drawn off, despairing to remain in Bologna upon
his own legs; quitted the Town, and left it to re-admit its old Governor Antonio Benti|vogli,
who was chief of the contrary party.
All these things succeeded, during the banishment of Cosimo; upon whose return, those
persons who were active in his restauration, and those who had suffered more than ordina|rily
before, concluded (without regard to any body else) to secure themselves of all the Of|fices
in the State. The Senate which succeeded for the months of November and December,
not satisfied with what their predecessors had done in favour of their party; they lengthned
the time, changed the places of several which were banished, and sent many new ones into
banishment after them. The Citizens were questioned and molested, not only for their in|clinations
to the parties, but for their wealth, their relations, and private correspondencies.
And, had this proscription proceeded to blood, it had been as bad as Octaviano's, or Silla's:
nor was it altogether without; for Antonio di Bernardo was beheaded, and four other Ci|zens,
(of which Zanobi Bel Fratelli, and Cosimo Barbadori were two) who having escaped
out of their Dominions, and being gotten to Venice; the Venetians (valuing Cosimo's friend
ship before their own honour and reputation) caused them to be secured, sent them priso|ners
home; where they were most unworthily put to death. However, that example gave
great advantage to Cosimo's party, and great terror to the adverse; when it was considered
that so potent a Republick should sell its liberty to the Florentines, which was supposed to
be done not so much in kindness to Cosimo, as to revive and incense the factions in Florence;
and by engaging them in blood, to render the animosities in that City irreconcilable, the Ve|netians
being jealous of no other obstruction to their greatness, but the Union of those par|ties.
Having pillaged and banished all such as were enemies, or suspected to be so to the
State, they applied themselves to charess and oblige new persons to corroborate their party;
restored the Family of the Alberti,New Ordi|nances in Flo|rence and who-ever else had been proclaimed Rebel to his
Country. All the Grandees (except some few) were reduced into the popular rank; the
Estates of the Rebels they sold to one another for a song. After which, they fortified them|selves
with new Laws, new Magistrates, and new Elections, pulling out such as they thought
their enemies, and filling the purses with the names of their friends. But, admonished by

the ruine of their friends; and thinking not enough for the security of their Government,
to make the imborsation as they pleas'd; they contrived, that all Officers of life and death
should be created out of the chief of their party; and that the Persons who were to over|see
the imborsations, and the new Squittini, should (with the Senators) have power to
create them. To the Eight of the Guards, they gave authority of life and death. They
decreed, that the banished Persons should not return (though the time of their banishment
was expired) till leave given them by four and thirty of the Senate and the Colledges,
when their whole number amounted but to thirty and seven. They made it criminal to
write, or receive Letters from them: every word, every sign, every motion that was un|pleasing
to the Governors, was punished severely; and if any one remained suspected who
had escaped these injuries, they loaded him with new duties and impositions, till, in a short
time, they had cleared the City of their Enemies, and secur'd the Government to them|selves.
However that they might want no assistance from abroad, and intercept it from
such as should design against them; they enter'd into League with the Pope, the Venetians,
and the Duke of Milan.
Things being in this posture in Florece, Giovanna Queen of Naples died, and, by will
made Rinieri d Angio her heir. Alphonso, King of Aragon, was at that time in Sicily, and
having good interest with many of the Nobility of that Kingdom, he prepared to possess
it. The Neapolitans and several others of the Lords were favourers of Rinieri. The
Pope had no mind that either the one or the other should have it but would willingly have
governed by a Deputy of his own. In the mean time Alphonso arrived out of Sicily,
and was received by the Duke of Sessa; where he entertained certain Princes into his pay,
with design (having Capua in his possession, which was governed at that time, in his name,
by the Prince of Taranto) to force the Neapolitans to his will. Wherefore he sent his Army
against Caietta, which was defended by a Garison of Neapolitans. Upon this Invasion,
the Neapolitans demanded assistance of Philip; who recommended the Enterprize to the
people of Genoa; the Genoeses not only to gratifie the Duke, who was their Prince, but to
preserve the goods and effects which they had at that time both in Naples, and Caietta,
rigg'd out a strong fleet immediately. Alphonso having news of their preparations, re|inforc'd
himself, went in Person against the Genoeses, and coming to an engagement with
them of the Island of Pontus, he was beaten, taken Prisoner, (with several other Princes)
and presented by the Genoeses into the hands of Duke Philip.Alphonso brought pri|soner to Duke Philip. This Victory astonished all
the Princes of Italy, who had any apprehension of the power of Philip, beleiving it would
give him opportunity to make himself Master of all: but he (so different are the judg|ments
of men) took his measures quite contrary. Alphonso was a wise and prudent Prince,
and as soon as he had convenience of discoursing with Philip, remonstrated to him how
much he was mistaken in siding with Rinieri; for that assuredly, having made himself
King of Naples, he would endeavour, with all his Power, to bring Milan in subjection to
the French, that his assistance might be near him, and that upon any distress, he might not be
put to it to force a way for his supplies; nor was there any way to do it so effectuall, as by
ruining him, and introducing the French. That the contrary would happen by making
Alphonso Prince; for then, having no-body, to fear but the French, he should be obliged to
love and charess the Duke above any body in whose power it would be to give his enemies
a passage; by which means Alponso should have the title, but the power and authority
would remain in Duke Philip: insomuch, that it imported the Duke much more than him|self,
to consider the dangers of one side, with the advantages of the other, unless he desired
more to satisfie his passion than to secure his State. For, as by that way he would continue
free and independent; by the other, (lying betwixt two powerful Princes) he would lose
his State quite, or living in perpetual apprehension, be a slave to them both. These words
wrought so much upon the Duke, that, changing his designs, he set Alphonso at liberty, sent
him back to Genoa, and from thence into the Kingdom of Naples, where he landed at Caietta
which upon the news of his enlargement, had been seized by some Lords of his party.
The Genoeses (understanding how, without any regard to them, the Duke had discharged
the King; and, considering with themselves, that of all their danger and expence, he had
ingrossed the honour, impropriated the thanks of the Kings inlargement, and left them no|thing
but his regrate and indignation for having defeated and taken him prisoner) were
highly dissatisfied with the Duke.
In the City of Genoa,The Dogs and his autho|rity in Cenoa. when it has the free exercise of its liberty by the free suffrages of
the people, a chief is chosen, which they call their Doge; not with the absolute power of
a Prince, to determine arbitrarily of any thing; but to purpose and recommend what is to
be debated and resolved upon by the Magistrates in the Council. In the same City there
are many Noble Families so mighty and potent, they are not without difficulty to be brought

to any obedience to the Magistrate. Of all those Families, the Tregosi and Adorni are most
powerful and wealthy; and from them spring all the divisions of the City, and all the con|tempt
of the Laws; for differing perpetually among themselves, and pretending both to
the Dogeship; they are not contented to have it fairly decided, but came many times to
blows; by which, as one is set up, the other is always depressed; and sometimes it fals out,
that that party which is over-power'd, and unable to carry that Office otherwise, calls in
foreign assistance, and prostitutes that Government, which they cannot enjoy themselves, to
the dominion of a stranger.
By this means it comes often to pass, that they who have the Government in Lombardy,
have the command of Genoa likewise; as it happened at the time when Alphonso was ta|ken
prisoner. Among the principal Citizens of Genoa, who caused that City to be deliver|ed
into the hands of the Duke,Francisco Spinola. Francisco Spinola was one; who not long after he had been
very active to enslave his Country, became suspected to the Duke (as it often happens in
those cases) Francisco being highly dissatisfied, left the Town; and by a kind of voluntary
exile, had his residence at Caietta; being there at that time when the engagement was with
Alphonso, and having behav'd himself very well in it; he presumed he had again merited so
much favour from the Duke, as to be permitted to live quietly in Genoa: but finding the
Duke's jealousie to continue, (as not believing he, that had betrayed his Country could ever
be true to him) he resolved to try a new experiment, to restore his Country to its li|berty,
and himself to his honour and security at once; believing no remedy could be ad|ministred
so properly to his fellow Citzens, as by the same hand which gave them their
wound. Observing therefore the general indignation against the Duke for having delivered
the King; he concluded it a convenient time to put his designs in execution; and accor|dingly
he communicated his resolutions with certain Persons, which he had some confidence
were of the same opinion, and encouraged them to follow him. It happened to be S. Iohn
Baptist's day (which is a great Festival in that City) when Arismino, a new Governor, sent
them from the Duke, made his entry into Genoa. Being entred into the Town in the
Company of Opicino (his predecessor in the Government) and other considerable Citizens,
Francisco Spinola thought it no time to protract, but running forth Armed into the streets,
with such as were before privy to his design, he drew them up in the Piazza before his
house, and cryed out Liberty, Liberty. 'Tis not to be imagined with what alacrity the
people and Citizens ran to him at that very name; insomuch, that if any out of interest
or other consideration, retain'd an affection for the Duke, they were so far from having time
to arm, and make defence, they had scarce leisure to escape. Arismino, with some of the
Genoeses of his party, fled into the Castle which was kept for the Duke. Opicino presuming
he might get thither, fled towards the Palace, where he had 2000 men at his command,
with which he supposed he might not only be able to secure himself, but to animate the
people to a defence; but he reckoned without his Host; for, before he could reach it, he
was knock'd on the head, torn in pieces by the multitude, and his members drag'd about
the Streets.
After,Genoa reco|vers its liberty. this the Genoeses having put themselves under new Magistrates and Officers of their
own, the Castle and all other posts which were kept for the Duke, were reduced, and the
City perfectly freed from its dependance on the Duke. these things thus managed, though
at first they gave the Princes of Italy occasion to apprehend the growing greatness of the
Duke, yet, now observing their conclusion, they did not despair of being able to curb him;
and therefore, notwithstanding their late League with him, the Florentines Venetians and
Genoeses made a new one among themselves. Whereupon Rinaldo de gli Albizi, and the
other chief Florentine Exiles seeing the face of affairs altered, and all things tending to con|fusion,
they conceived hopes of persuading the Duke to a War against Florence, and going
upon that design to Milan,Rinaldo's Ora|tion to the Duke of Milan. Rinaldo accosted the Duke as followeth:
If we, who have been formerly your Enemies, do now with confidence supplicate your
assistance for our return into our own Country; neither your Highness, nor any body
else, (who considers the Progress of humane affairs, and the volubility of fortune) ought at
all to be surprized, seeing both of our pass'd and present actions, of what we have done
formerly to your self, and of what we intend now to our Country, we can give a clear
and a reasonable account. No good man will reproach another for defending his Country,
which way soever he defends it. Nor was it ever our thoughts to injure you, but to pre|serve
our Country; which will be evident, if you consider how in the greatest stream of
our victories and success, we no sooner found your Highness dispos'd to a peace, but we
readily embraced it, and pursued it with more eagerness than your self: so that as yet we
are not conscious to our selves of any thing that may make us doubt of your favour.
Neither can our Country, in justice, complain, that we are now pressing and importuning

your Highness to imploy those Arms against it, when we have obstinately oppos'd them
before, in its defence: for that Country ought equally to be beloved by all which is equally
indulgent to all; and not that, which despising the rest, advances and admires only a few.
No-body maintains it unlawful in all cases to bear Arms against ones Country. Cities are
mix'd bodies, yet have they their resemblance with natural bodies; and, as in these, many
diseases grow which are not to be cur'd without violence: so in the other, many times
such inconveniences arise, that a charitable and good Citizen would be more criminal to
leave it infirm, than to cure it, though with amputation, and the loss of some of its
members. What greater distemper can befal a politick body than servitude? And what more
proper remedy can be applyed than that which will certainly remove it; Wars are
just, when they are necessary; and Arms are charitable when there is no other hopes left
to obtain justice. I know not what necessity can be greater than ours; nor what act of
charity more commendable, than to wrest our Country out of the jaws of slavery. Our
cause then being both just and charitable, ought not to be slighted, either by us, or your
Highness, though it were only in compassion. But your Highness has your particular
provocation besides; the Florentines having had the confidence, after a peace solemnly
concluded with you, to enter into a new League with the Genoeses your Rebels; so that
if our prayers and condition should be unable, your own just indignation and resentment
should move you, especially seeing the enterprize so easie. Let not their pass'd carriage
discourage you, you have seen their power and resolution to defend themselves formerly;
and both of them were reasonably to be apprehended, were they the same now as they
have been, But you will find them quite contrary, for, what strength, what wealth, can
be expected in a City which has lately exploded the greatest part of its rich and industrious
men? What obstinacy or resolution can be apprehended in a people which are divided,
and at enmity among themselves? Which enmity is the cause that, that very treasure which
is left, cannot now be imployed so well as it formerly was; for men do chearfully disburse,
when they see it is for the honour and security of their Country; hoping, that peace may
reprize, what the War has devour'd. But when in War and Peace they find themselves
equally oppressed; and under a necessity in the one, of enduring the outrages of their
enemies; and in the other, of truckling to the insolencies of their friends; No-body will
supply our advance one farthing towards its relief: and the people suffer more many times
by the avarice of their friends, than by the rapacity of their enemies; for in this last case
they have hopes some time or other to see an end of it; but in the other they are desperate.
In your last War you took up Arms against an intire and united City; in this, you have
to do only with a remnant. Then, you attempted upon the liberty of the City; now
you will endeavour to restore it: and it is not to be feared, that in such disparity of
causes, the effects should be the same. Nay rather your Victory is certain, and what ad|vantage
and corroboration, that will be to your own State, is easily judged; having Tuscany
obliged to you thereby, and readier to serve you in any of your designs, than Milan it self.
So that, though formerly this acquest would have been look'd upon as usurpation and vio|lence;
it will be now esteemed an high piece of justice and charity. Suffer not therefore
this opportunity to pass, and be sure, if your other enterprizes against this City have pro|duced
nothing but expence, difficulty, and dishonour; this will make you amends, and
with great ease, turn to your great honour and advantage.
The Duke needed not many words to excite him against the Florentines; he had
an hereditary quarel to them, which (besides the blindness of his ambition) did always
provoke him, and now more than ordinarily, upon occasion of their new League with the
Genoeses. However the expences and dangers he had formerly pass'd, the memory of his
late defeat, and the vanity and ill-grounded hopes of the exiles, discouraged him quite.
The Duke, upon the first news of the Rebellion in Genoa, sent Nicolo Piccinino, with what
Forces he had and could get together, towards that City, to recover it, if possible, before the
Citizens should have compos'd themselves, or put the Government into order; presuming
much upon the Castle which stood out for him. And though Nicolo drove the Genoeses up
into the Mountains, and took from them the vale of Pozivori, where they had fortified
themselves; yet he found so much difficulty afterwards, (though he had beat them into the
Town) that he was forc'd to draw off. Whereupon at the instigation of the exiles, he
received orders from the Duke, that he should attack them on the East-side of the River,
and make what devastations he could in their Country towards Pisa; supposing that by the
success of this expedition, he should be able to judge from time to time what course he was
to steer. Upon the receit of these orders, Nicolo assaulted Serezana, and took it and then
having done much mischief in those parts to alarm the Florentines, he marched towards

Lucca, giving out he would pass that way into the Kingdom of Naples, to assist the King
of Aragon. Pope Eugenius, upon these new accidents, departed from Florence to Bologna,
where he proposed and negotiated an accommodation betwixt the Duke and the League;
representing to the Duke, that if he would not comply, he would be forc'd to part with
the Conte Francesco to the League; for Francesco being his confederate, was at that time
under his pay. But, though his Holiness took much pains in the business, that treaty came
to nothing; for the Duke would not consent, unless Genoa were restored; and the League
were as obstinate to have it remain free; so that all parties growing diffident of the peace,
each of them began to make provision for War. Nicolo Pinccinino being arrived at Lucca
the Florentines began to apprehend new troubles, caused Neri di Gino to march with all speed
into the Country of Pisa, and obtained of the Pope that Conte Francesco might joyn with
him, and their united Forces take their Post before St. Gonda: Piccinino being at Lucca,
desired a passport to go into the Kingdom of Naples, and being denied, he threatened to force
it. The Armies and Officers were of equal number and eminence; so that neither side
being over-forward to run the hazard of a Battel, by reason of the extraordinary coldness
of the weather, (it being in December) they lay by one another several days without any
action at all. The first that moved was Nicolo Piccinino; who was inform'd, that if in the
night he assaulted Vico Pisano he should easily carry it. Nicolo attempted it; but failing
of his design, he plundered the Country about it, and burn'd the Town of S. Giovanni alla
Ven.
This enterprize (though for the most part ineffectual) encouraged Nicolo to proceed ne|vertheless;
especially, observing that the Conte and Neri stir'd not to molest him: there|upon
he assaulted St. Maria in Castello and Filetto, and took them both: nor did the Floren|tine
Army move for all that: not that the Conte was affraid to come forth, but because the
Magistrates in Florence (out of respect to the Pope, who was mediating a peace) had not as
yet resolved upon the War: and that which was but prudence in the Florentines, being in|terpreted
fear by the enemy, they took courage, and with all the Forces they could make, sate
down before Barga. The news of that siege caused the Florentines to lay aside all compli|ments
and respect; and to resolve not only to relieve Barga, but to invade the Country of
the Lucchesi. Whereupon the Conte marching directly against Nicolo, and giving Battel
to force him from the Siege he worsted his Army, and made him draw off: the Venetians in
the mean time perceiving the Duke had broke the League, sent Giovan Francesco da Gonza|gue
their General, with an Army as far as Chiaradadda, who spoyling the Duke's Country,
constrained him to call back Nicolo Piccinino out of Tuscany. Which revocation, with the
Victory they had lately obtained against Nicolo, encouraged the Florentines to an expediti|on
against Lucca, and gave them great hopes of success: in which they carried themselves
without either fear or respect, seeing the Duke (who was the only person they apprehended)
imployed by the Venetians; and the Lucchesi, by having, as it were, received their enemies
into their houses, and given them cause to invade them, had left themselves no grounds to
complain.
In April therefore,1437. in the year 1437 the Conte march'd with his Army; and before he
would fall upon any thing of the enemies, he addressed himself to the recovery of what
had been lost, and accordingly he reduced S. Maria de Castello and what-ever else had been
taken by Piccinino. Then advancing against the Lucchesi, he sate down before Camajore;
whose Garison and inhabitants (though well enough affected to their Lord) being more
influenced by the terror of an enemy at hand, than their fidelity to their friends a far off,
surrendered immediately; after which, he took Massa and Serazan with the same dexterity
and reputation; and then turning his Army towards Lucca in the month of May; he de|stroyed
their Corn, burn'd their Villages, stubb'd up their Vines, and their Fruit-trees,
drove away their Cattel, and omitted nothing of outrage and hospitality that is, or can be
committed by Souldiers. The Lucchesi seeing themselves abandoned by the Duke, and un|able
to defend their Country, retir'd into the Town, where they intrench'd and fortified so
well, that they did not doubt (by reason of their numbers within) but to be able to Make
it good for some time, as they had formerly done. Their only fear was of the unconstancy
of the people, who being weary of the siege, would probably consider their own private
danger before the liberty of their Country, and force them to some ignominious accord.
Whereupon, to encourage them to a vigorous defence, they were called together into the
Market-place, and one of the wisest and gravest of the Citizens spake to them as follow|eth.
You have often heard,The Speech of a Citizen of Lucca to the people. and must needs understand, that things done of necessity, ar
neither to be praised, nor condemned. If therefore you accuse us of having drawn this
War upon you, by entertaining the Duke's Forces, and suffering them to assault you; you

are highly mistaken. You cannot be ignorant of the ancient and inveterate hatred the
Florentines bear you; so that 'tis not any injury in you, nor any resentment in them, but
your weakness and their ambition which has provoked them; the first giving them hopes,
the other impatience to oppress you. Do not think that any kindness of yours can di|vert
them from that desire; nor any injury of yours provoke them to be worse? 'Tis
their business therefore to rob you of your liberty; 'tis yours to defend it; and what
either of you do in pursuance of those ends may be lamented, but cannot be wondred at
by any body: we may be sorry our Country is invaded, our City besieged, our Houses
burned; but who of us all is so weak as to admire it? Seeing, if our power were as
great we would do the same to them, and, if possible, worse. If they pretend this War
was occasioned by our admitting of Nicolo; had he not been received, they would have
pretended another; and, perhaps, had this invasion been deferred, it might have proved
more fatal and pernicious; so that 'tis not his coming is to be blamed, but our ill fortune,
and the ambition of their nature; for we could not refuse the Duke's Forces; and when
they were come, it was not in our power to keep them from doing acts of Hostility: you
know very well, that without the assistance of some considerable Prince, we had not been
able to defend our selves; nor was any man more proper to relieve us, both in respect of his
fidelity and power, than the Duke. He restored us to our liberty, and 'twas but reasona|ble
he should secure it. He was always an enemy to those who would never be our
friends; if therefore we have provoked the Duke, rather than we would disoblige the
Florentines, we have lost a true friend and made our enemy more able and more ready to
offend us: so that it is much better for us to have this War, with the friendship of the
Duke; than to have peace, with his displeasure: and we have reason to hope he will re|scue
us from these dangers to which he has exposed us, if we be not wanting to our selves.
You cannot forget with what fury the Florentines have many times assaulted us; and with
what honour and reputation we have repelled them, even when we have had no hopes but
in God and in time, and how both of them have preserved us. If we defended our
selves then; what reason now is there to despair? Then we were deserted by all Italy and left
as a prey to the Enemy; now we have the Duke on our side, and 'tis not improbable the
Venetians will be but slow in their motions against us; seeing it can be no pleasure to them
to see the power of the Florentines encrease. Then the Florentines were more free and
unengaged, had more hopes of assistance, and were stronger of themselves and we every
way weaker; for then we defended a Tyrant, now we fight for our selves; then the ho|nour
went to other people, now it returns upon us; then they were united and entire,
now they are divided, and all Italy full of their Rebels. But if we had none of these
reasons, nor none of these hopes to excite us, extreme necessity would be sufficient to ani|mate
us to our defence. Every enemy ought in reason to be apprehended by us, because
all of them seek their own glory, and our destruction; but, above all, the Florentines
ought to be most dreadful, who are not to be satisfied with our obedience, tribute, nor the
government of our City; but they must have our persons and Wealths, to satiate their
cruelty with our blood, and their avarice with our estates; so that there is no person nor
condition among us so mean, but ought justly to fear them. Let No-body therefore be
dismaid to see our Country wasted, our Villages burn'd, and our Lands possessed by the
enemy: if we preserve our City, they of course will revert: if we lose our City, to what
purpose will they be kept? maintaining our liberty; the enemy can hardly enjoy them:
but losing our liberty what comfort would it be to retain them? Take arms therefore
with courage, and when you are engaged with your enemy, remember the reward of your
Victory is not only the safety of your Country, but the preservation and security of your
children and estates.
These last words were received by the people with such warmth and vigor of mind, that
unanimously they promised to die rather than to desert their City, or entertain any treaty
that might intrench upon their liberty; so that immediately order was taken for all things
necessary for the defence of the City. In the mean time the Florentine Army was not idle,
after many mischiefs and depredations in the Country, they took Monte-Carlo upon condi|tions;
after which they encamp'd at Uzano, that the Lucchesi being straitned on all sides,
and made desperate of relief, might be constrained to surrender. The Castle was strong,
and furnished with a good Garrison; so that was not so easily to be carried as the rest. The
Lucchesi (as was but reason) seeing themselves distressed, had recourse to the Duke, and re|commended
their case to him with all manner of expression; sometimes they commemo|rated
the services they had done him: sometimes they remonstrated the cruelty of the Flo|rentines:
what courage it would give the rest of his friends to see him interpose in their
defence; and what terror it would infuse to see them expos'd: for if they lost their liberty

and their lives, he would lose his honor, and his friends, and the fidelity of all those who
had ever expos'd themselves to any danger for his sake: which words were deliver'd with
tears, that if his obligations should fail, his compassion might move him to assist them. In|somuch
that the Duke, adding to his old animosity to the Florentines, his late engage|ments
to the Lucchesi, but above all being jealous of the greatness of the Florentine, which
of necessity would follow so important acquest; he resolved to send a great Army into
Tuscany, or else to fall so furiously upon the Venetians, that the Florentines should be con|strain'd
to quit that enterprize to relieve them: he had no sooner taken this resolution
but they had news at Florence that the Duke was sending forces into Tuscany; which made
them suspicious of their designs, and therefore, to find the Duke imployment at home,
they solicited the Venetian very earnestly that they would attack him in Lombardy with all
the power they could make: but they were not only weakened, but disheartened by the
departure of the Marquess of Mantoua, who had left their service, and taken arms under the
Duke. Whereupon they return'd this answer, that they were so far from being able to in|gross
the War, they could not assist in it, unless they sent Conte Francesco to command their
Army; and oblig'd him by Articles to pass the Po. with them in person (seeing by the old
agreement he was not to go so far) for without a General they would undertake no War;
nor could they have confidence in any but the Count; nor in him neither, unless he oblig'd
himself to pursue the War in all places alike.
The Florentines were of opinion the War was to be carried on briskly in Lombardy; yet
on the otherside to remove the Conte was to destroy their designs against Lucca, and they
were very sensible, that demand was made, not so much out of any necessity they had of the
Conte, as to defeat that enterprize. The Conte, for his part, was by contract oblig'd to
to go into Lombardy whenever he should be requir'd by the League; but now he was unwil|ling
to forfeit his hopes of that allyance which the Duke had promis'd him, by marrying
him to one of his relations. So that betwixt the desire of conquering Lucca, and the fear
of having Wars with the Duke, the Florentines were in no little distraction. But their
fear (as it always happens) was the stronger passion of the two, insomuch as they were con|tent
(as soon as Uzano was taken) the Conte should pass into Lombardy. But there was
still a difficulty behind, which not being in their power to dissolve, gave the Florentines
more trouble and jealousie, than any thing else; and that was, that the Conte would not
be oblig'd to pass the Po, and without it, the Venetians would not entertain him, there
being no way to accommodate this difference, but of necessity one of them must submit; the
Florentines persuaded the Conte that in a letter to the Senate of Florence he should oblige
himself to pass that river, alledging that a private promise not being sufficient to dissolve a
publick stipulation, he might do afterwards as he pleas'd; and which way soever he acted,
this convenience would certainly follow, that the Venetians having begun the War, would
be compelled to pursue it; and that humor be inevitably diverted, which was so much to
be fear'd.
To the Venetians they intimated on he other side, That that letter, though private, was
sufficient to bind him, and that they ought to be satisfied therewith: that whilst it might
be done securely it would be best to conceal it, and indulge his respects to his Father-in-Law
for it would be neither for his, nor their advantage to have it discovered, without mani|fest
necessity: and in this manner the Florentines concluded upon the Conte's passage into
Lombardy; and the Conte having taken in Uzano, cast up certain new works about
Lucca to keep from fallying,  recommended the War to the Commissioners which succed|ed;Jealousie be|twixt the Vene|tian and the Coun.
he pass'd the Alpes, and went to Reggio, where the Venetians (being jealous of his
proceedings) to discover his inclinations, put him at first dash upon passing the Po,
and joyning the rest of their Army; which the Conte peremptorily refus'd, and many ill
words passed betwixt him and Andrea Mauroceno who was sent about it from the Veneti|ans:
upbraiding one another by their pride and infidelity; and after several protestati|ons
on both sides; on the one, that he was not oblig'd to it; on the other that he should
not be paid without it, the Conte returned into Tuscany, and his adversary to Venice. The
Conte was quarter'd by the Florentines in the Country of Pisa; and they were not with|out
hopes of prevailing with him to reassume his command against the Lucchesi; but they
found him not dispos'd; for the duke not understanding he had refus'd to pass the Po, in com|pliment
to him (fancying by his means he might preserve Lucca) he desired him that he
would be an instrument to make peace betwixt the Lucchesi and the Florentines, and if he could
to comprehend him also, insinuating by the by, that in convenient time he should
marry his Daughter. This march had great influence upon the Conte, who persuaded
himself the Duke having no heirs Males might thereby in time come to the Government
of Milan. Upon which grounds he discouraged the Florentines from prosecuting the war

affirming that for his own part he would not stir, unless the Venetians paid him his arreers,
and performed the rest of their Covenants; for his pay alone would not do his business,
wherefore it concern'd him to secure his own State, and therefore he was to look out for o|ther
allies, and not depend only upon the friendship of the Florentines: that seeing he was
abandon'd by the Venetians he was obliged to a stricter regard to his own affairs; and
threatened very slily to make an agreement with the Duke. These tricks and expostula|tions
were not at all to the Florentines satisfaction. They found their design upon Lucca
lost, and their own State in danger, whenever the Duke and the Conte united. To prevail
with the Venetians to make good their termes, Cosimo de Medici was dispatched to them,
(supposing his reputation might have some influence upon them) and a long speech to
their Senate, he represented the posture of affairs in Italy; the power and conduct of the
Duke; and concluded, that if the Count and he joyned, the Venetians would be confin'd
to the Sea, and the Florentines in no small danger of their liberty: to which it was answer'd
by the Venetian that they had well considered the condition of Italy, and their own; and
did believe they were every way able to defend themselves;The Veneti|ans untractable however it was not their cu|stom
to pay any Body for doing other People service. It belonged therefore to the Flo|rentines
to see the Conte satisfied, seeing it was they had had the benefit of his service, or
rather (if they had a mind to preserve themselves in security for the future) to correct
and rebate his insolence than to pay him; for Men put no bounds to their ambition; and
if he should then be paid without doing any service, his next demand, in all liklyhood,
would be more insolent and dangerous: in their judgment therefore it was high time to
put a stop to his carreer, and not let him run on, till he became incorrigible; but if out of
fear, or any other consideration they had a mind to continue him their friend; their best
way would be to pay him: with which answer Cosimo return'd, and nothing was conclu|ded.
The Florentines nevertheless interceded very earnestly with the Conte that he would
not forsake the League; who had no great inclination to it himself; but his desire to con|summate
the marriage with the Dukes Daughter, kept him in such suspence, that upon eve|ry
little accident he was ready to leave them. The Conte had left his Towns in la Marca, to
be secured by Furlano, one of his principal Officers: this Furlano was earnestly solicited by
the Duke, that he left the Conte's service, and joyned himself to him. Whereupon laying
aside all other respects to save his own stake, the Conte came to an agreement likewise with
the Duke, and among the rest of the Articles, this was one, that for the future the Conte should
not intermedle in the affairs either of Romagna or Tuscany. After he had made this peace
with the Duke, the Conte was very importunate with the Florentines to come to an agreement
with the Lucchesi; and he persuaded them so far, that finding no other remedy, they
came to a composition with them in the month of April 1438, by which capitulation the
Lucchesi were to have their liberties preserved; and the Florentines to keep possession of
Monti Carlo, and some other Castles which they had taken before: after which they writ
many sad letters up and down Italy, lamenting that seeing God and Man were unwilling
that the Lucchesi should fall under their Dominion, they had been constrained to a peace
with them: and so much were they concerned for their disappointment in that enterprize,
that seldom has any Body been known to lose their own Estates with more impatience and
regret, than the Florentines express'd, for not gaining other peoples. However though
the Florentines at that time had so many irons in the fire; they forgot not their alliances
with their Neighbours, nor the decoration of their City. Nicolo Fortebraccio (who had
married a Daughter of the Conte de Poppi) being dead, Poppi had the command of the
Borgo san Sepulcro,Conte di Poppi. the Castle, and other appendixes, which he kept in behalf of his
Son-in-Law, whilst his Son-in-Law lived,; refusing afterwards to surrender them to the
Pope who demanded them as usurped from the Church: upon which refusal the Pope sent
the Patriarch with an Army to recover them by force. The Conte di Poppi finding himself
unable to defend them, offered them to the Florentines, who would not accept them:
however upon the Pope's return to Florence, they interposed, and laboured an agreement
betwixt his Holiness and the Conte.
But finding the Treaty difficult and dilatory; the Patriarch fell upon Casentino, took
Prato Vecchio and Romena, and proffered them likewise to the Florentines; but they could
not be accepted, unless the Pope would consent they should restore them to the Conte, which
after much argumentation he did, upon condition the Florentines should use their interest
with Conte Poppi to restore Burgo to him. The mind of his Holiness being at quiet by this
means the Florentines (the Cathedral Church of their City, call'd Santa Reparata, ha|ving
been out of repair, long since begun to be mended, and now brought to that perfecti|on,
Divine service might be celebrated in it) entreated his Holiness that he would oblige

them so far, as to consecrate it himself: to which he willingly condescended; and for
the greater magnificence of the Church and City, and the ostentation and honor of the Pope,
a Gallery was built from Santa Maria Novella (where the Pope held his Court to the
Church which was to be consecrated) four fathoms wide, and two high, covered over with
very rich Cloths, under which, only his Holiness, his Court, and such Magistrats of the
City as were appointed to attend him, were to pass all the rest of the Citizens and people,
having dispos'd themselves in the street, the Church, and a top of their Houses; to behold
so glorious a spectacle. The Ceremony being pass'd with the usual solemnity; his Holi|ness,
as a token of more then ordinary respect, confer'd the honor of Knighthood upon Gui|liano
de Avanzati at that time Gonfaloniere de Giustitia but always a very eminent Citi|zen;
to whom the Senate (that they might not seem behind hand with the Pope in any
point of Beneficence) gave the Government of the Pisa for a year.
About this time certain differences arising betwixt the Greek and the Roman Churches,Controver|sies betwixt the Greek and Ro|man Churches.
they could not agree in all particulars about the Divine Worship: and for as much as in the
last Council of Basil, much had been said upon that subject by the Prelats of the Church, it
was resolved that all diligence should be us'd to bring the Emperour, and the Prelats of the
Greek Church together to the Council of Basil, to try if there was any way to accomodate
them with the Romans. Though it was derogatory to the Majesty of the Emperour, and
contrary to the pride of his Prelats, to yield in any thing to the Romans, yet the Turk lying
heavy upon them, and fearing that of themselves they should not be able to resist him, that
they might with the more confidence and security desire relief from other people, they re|solv'd
to comply, and accordingly, as was directed by the Council of Basil, the Emperour,
the Patriarch,Determined at Florence, by the submission of the Greek. and several other Prelats and Barons of Greece, arrived at Venice; but being
frighted from thence by the Plague, it was resolved they should remove to Florence and all
their differences be discussed and determined in that City: being assembled, and for many
days together both Roman and Greek Prelats, all of them in the Cathedral; after many and
long disputations, the Grecians condescended, and complyed with the Church and Bishop
of Rome.
The peace betwixt the Lucchesi, and the Florentines, and betwixt the Duke and the
Conte, being concluded; it was thought no hard matter to put an end to the Wars of
Italy, especially in Lombardy, in Tuscany; for the War in the Kingdom of Naples betwixt
Rinato di Angio and Alphonso d' Aragona, was hardly to be compos'd but by the ruine of
one of them: and though the Pope was discontented for the loss of so many Towns; and the
ambition of the Duke and Venetian was sufficiently known; yet it was suppos'd ne|cessity
would force the one of lay down, and weariness the other: but they were out in their
conjectures; for neither Duke nor Venetian could be persuaded to be quiet; but on the
contrary they took Arms afresh, and Lombardy and Tuscany was filled again with their Ho|stilities.
The ambitious and haughty mind of the Duke could not brook that the Venetians
should keep Bergamo and Brescia; and the rather because he observ'd them always in Arms,
perpetually making incursions all over his Country; in which, he thought he should not
only restrain them, but recover all he had lost, when ever the Pope, the Florentines, and the
Conte should desert them: he designed therefore to take Romagna from the Pope suppo|sing
when he had gained that, it would not be in his Holiness Power to offend him; and
the Florentines seeing the fire at their own doors, would not stir for fear of themselves; or
if they did, they could not assault him conveniently. The Duke understood likewise how
angry the Florentines were with the Venetians, about the business of Lucca and upon
that score concluded them the less likely to take up arms for the Venetians: and as to Conte
Francesco, he did not doubt his new amity, and the hopes of his marriage, would keep him
quiet and safe.
To prevent Scandal, and give less occasion to any Body to stir (having oblig'd himself
by his Articles with the Conte not to meddle with Romagna) he caus'd Nicolo Piccinino to
take the enterprize upon himself, and fall upon it as of his own ambition and avarice. Nicolo,
at the time of the treaty betwixt the Duke and the Conte, was in Romagna and (by the
Dukes direction) shew'd himself much dissatisfied at his agreement with his implacable ad|versary,
the Conte. Whereupon he retired with his Army (in great discontent as was
pretended) to Camurata (a Town betwixt Furli and Ravenna) and fortified himself, as
if he designed to make good that Quarter, till he could find some better entertainment
and the report of his disgust being spread all over Italy, Nicolo took order to have his ser|vices
and the Dukes ingratitude, remonstrated to the Pope; and that though by the ente|rest
of two of the principal Generals, he had got all the forces of Italy under his command,
yet if his Holiness would say the word, he could contrive things so, that one of them should
become his enemy, and the other unserviceable; for if he would provide him with monies

and supply him with Men, he would fall upon the Towns which the Conte had usurped
from the Church, and by giving the Conte imployment for the preservation of his own
Countries, render him incapable of being subservient to the ambition of the Duke. The
Pope believing what he said to be rational and true, sent him 5000 Ducats, besides large
promises of provision for himself and his Children; and though many times he was admo|nished
to have a care of being deceived yet he would never suspect, nor admit one word to
the contrary.
The City of Ravenna was at that time commanded for the Church by Ostasio da Polenta,The Pope de|luded, and his Country in|vaded by Pic|cinin.
Nicolo conceiving it no time to protract (his Son Francesco having plunder'd and sack'd
Spoleto to the great satisfaction of the Pope) resolved to attack Ravenna, either thinking
the enterprize easie in it self, or else holding private intelligence with Ostasio the Governour;
which soever it was, he had not invested it many days, before it was surrendered upon ar|ticles;
and that being taken Bologna, Imola, and Furli followed in a short time; and
that which was most strange, was, that of twenty strong holds which in those parts were
garison'd by the Pope, there was not any one but submitted to Nicolo; and not contented
with these affronts to his Holiness, he added contumely to his injustice; and writ the Pope
word, that he had us'd him according to his deserts: for having impudently endeavoured
to interrupt the old friendship betwixt him and the Duke; and fill'd all Italy with letters
that he abandoned the Duke; and sided with the Venetian. Having possess'd himself of
Romagna, he left it to the Government of his Son Francesco; and passing himself with the
greatest part of his Army into Lombardy, he joyned the rest of the Dukes forces; assaulted
the Country of Brescia; and in a short time brought it under subjection, and when he
had done so, laid siege to the City: the Duke desirous that the Venetians might be expo|sed,
excused himself to the Pope the Florentines, and the Conte, pretending, that what was
done by Nicolo in Romagna, if it were contrary to their capitulations, was no less contrary
to his inclinations; suggesting privately, that when time and opportunity contributed, he
would make him sensible of his disobedience: the Florentines, and the Conte gave no great
credit to what he said; believing (as was true) that it was nothing but artifice to keep
them in suspence, till he conquered the Venetians, who supposing themselves able alone to
contend with the Duke, were too proud to desire assistance of any body, but with their
Captain Gatamelato, would wage War with him by themselves. The Conte Francesco
desired, by permission of the Florentines, that he might have gone to the relief of King Ri|nato
(had not the accidents in Romagna and Lombardy diverted him) and the Florentines
for the old friendship betwixt them and France, would have willingly consented, and the
Duke would have assisted Alphonso, for the kindness he had expressed to him in his former
distress: but both the one and the other had too much imployment at home, to concern
themselves in any differences abroad: the Florentines seeing Romagna over-run, and the
Venetians baffled by the Duke (apprehending their own, by the calamity of their Neigh|bours)
desired the Conte to come into Tuscany, that they might consider of some way to
obstruct the Dukes forces, which were then much stronger than ever they had been; ad|ding
withal, that if their insolence was not suddenly restrained, there was no state in Ita|ly
but would feel the incovenience.
The Conte knew well enough the apprehension of the Florentines was but reasonable;
yet his desire that his marriage with the Dukes daughter might proceed, kept him in su|spence:
and the Duke perceiving his mind, kept him up with reiterated hopes, (if he stir'd
not against him) for the young Lady was now of age to have it consummated, and many
times the Treaty was so far advanced, that all convenient preparations were made for the
Wedding, when of a sudden some new scruple or cavil was found to protract it: however
to make the Conte more secure, he added some deeds to his promises; and sent him thirty
thousand Florens, to which the Duke had engaged himself by the articles of marriage. But
this transaction hindered not the proceeding of the War in Lombardy. Every day the Vene|tian
lost some Town or other; the Boats they sent to secure the Rivers, were sunk and di|spers'd
by the Dukes forces; the Country of Bresca and Verona harassed and possess'd; and
those Cities both of them so straightly block'd up, the common opinion was, they could
not hold out: the Marquess of Mantua, who for many years had been their General, left
them; and went over to the Duke; so what their pride would not suffer them to do in the
beginning; in the process of War, they were driven to by their fear; for finding now
they had no remedy but in the friendship of the Conte, and the Florentines, they demanded it
of themselves; but not without much diffidence and suspition, least the Florentines should
make them the same answer, which in the enterprize of Lucca, they had received from them
about the affairs of the Conte: but they found them more tractable than they expected, and
indeed more than their carriage towards them had deserved. So much more prevalent in

the Florentines was their old quarrel to their Enemies than their new pick and excepti|ons
to their friends. And having long before prefaged the distress into which the Venetians of
necessity would fall; they had represented to the Conte how inseparable his ruine would be
from theirs; and that he would find himself deceiv'd, if he expected the Duke would e|steem
him more in his good, than his adverse fortune; for it was fear of him (whilst his affairs
were uncertain) and nothing else, had moved him to that treaty about his Daughter; and
forasmuch as the same thing which necessity constrains people to promise, it constrains
them to perform; it was necessary to continue the Duke in the same distress; which could
not be done, but by preserving the Grandeur of the Venetians. He ought therefore to con|sider,
that if the Venetians should be forced to quit their territory upon the land; he would
not only be deprived of the conveniences he might have from them, but of all that he might
reasonably expect from other People who were afraid of them; and if he reflected upon
other states of Italy, he would find some of them poor; and some of them Enemies; and
alone (as they had often inculcated) the Florentines were not able to maintain him; so that
in all respects it was his interest to sustain the Dominion of the Venetians upon the Terra fir|ma.The Conte earnestly per|suaded not to desert the Ve|netians. 1438.
These persuasions, added to the hatred the Conte had conceived against the Duke, for
his jugling about his Daughter, dispos'd him to the agreement; yet not so as to oblige him|self
to pass the Po.
The Articles were agreed in February 1438, in which the Venetians engag'd to defray
two thirds of the Charge of the War,  the Florentines one; each of them obliging themselves
at their own expences to defend the Conte's lands in la Marca in the mean time. Nor was
the League contented with these forces and allies; for they joyned to them the Lord of
Faenza, the Sons of Pandolfo Malatesta da Rimino and Piero Giampagolo Ursino; they tryed
the Marquess of Mantoua likewise; but they could not remove him from the Duke; to whom
the Lord of Faenza revolted (upon better conditions) though he had enter'd the League;
which put them into great fear they should not be able to execute their designs in Romagna
so readily as they propos'd: at this time Lombardy was in such distress, that Brescia was
besieged by the Dukes forces, and reduced into such a condition, it was daily expected when
by famine it should be constrained to surrender. Verona was in the same condition, and if
either of them was taken, it was concluded all farther opposition would be in vain, and all
their expences hitherto lost: against this there was no visible remedy, but to send the Conte
into Lombardy and in that there were three difficulties. One was to persuade the Conte to
pass the Po, and carry on the War in all places: the second was, that the Florentines seemed
to be exposed thereby, and left to the discretion of the Duke, who retiring into his own
fastnesses, might divide his forces, and facing the Conte with one party, joyn with their
rebels with the other, and march into Tuscany; which was a course they were not a little a|fraid
of. The third was, to resolve which way the Conte might pass most securely into the
Contry of Padua to the Venetian Army. Of these three difficulties, the second relating
to the Florentines, took up the greatest debate; but knowing the necessity, and tired with
the Venetians (who press'd for the Conte with all imaginable opportunity, and protested
that without him they would give over all) they prefer'd the necessity of their associate be|fore
any danger of their own.
However, the difficulty of the way was refer'd to be secured by the Venetians; and be|cause
for the managing of this Treaty, and inclining the Conte to pass into Lombardy, it was
thought fit that Neri the Son of Gino Capponi should be dispatched to him; the Senate con|cluded
to send for him to Venice, to make the imployment the more grateful, and instruct
him the more commodiously about the way the Conte was to march. Upon this invitati|on,
Neri departed from Cesena, and came by water to Venice, where never any Prince was
received with more honour and acclamation than he was by the Senate; for upon his com|ing
and the resolutions which thereupon they were to take, they believed the whole hap|piness
and safety of their Government did depend: Neri being introduced into the Senate,
spake to them in this manner.
Most Serene Prince,
MY Masters were always of Opinion,Neri's speech to the Vene|tian Senate. that the greatness of the Duke would be the de|struction
of your Commonwealth and their own; and that if any thing prevent|ed
it, it must be the Grandeur and prosperity of both. Had this been credited in time by
your Lordships our condition had been better than it is; and your state secure from
many dangers wherewith it is now infested; but you not having given us either assistance,
or credit, when our necessities required, we could not make such haste to your relief; nor
you desire it so readily as you might have done; had you known us better either in pro|sperity
or adversity; or understood that where we love once, our love is inextin|guishable,

and where we hate once, our hatred is immortal: the love and respect we have al|ways
retained to this illustrious Senate, you your selves do know; having many times
seen Lombardy full of our forces which was sent in to your relief: our animosity to Philip is
known to all the World, and we shall continue it to his family; for 'tis impossible old
love, or inveterate hatred can ever be expung'd, let the new injuries, or endearments be
as many as they will: we are, and have been assured, that in this War we might have stood
neuter, with great favour from the Duke, and no danger to our selves: for though by
your expulsion he had made himself Master of Lombardy; yet there would be enough left
in Italy to secure us; seeing envy is always concomitant with power; one encreases with
the other; and where envy is, War and distraction must follow. We were not insen|sible
likewise (by declining this War) how great charges, and danger we should have
avoided, and how easily, by our stirrings we may transplant into Tuscany: but all these
discouragments have been overrul'd by our affection of the state, and we resolved to as|sist
you with the same vigour, as we would defend our selves: to this end (most Noble
Lords) my Masters judging it necessary above all things to relieve Verona and Brescia;
and imagining that impossible, but by the conduct of the Count; they sent me first to him
to persuade his passing into Lombardy, (to which your Lordship knows he would never be
oblig'd) and to try the same arguments with him, as wrought upon us: as he is invin|cible
in Arms, so he is not to be out done in courtesie; and that frankness and Generosity
which he saw us practise towards you, he has endeavoured to exceed: he understood ve|ry
well how much he should leave Tuscany expos'd by his departure, but observing how we
postponed our own safety to yours, he very generously has promised to do the same, and
prefers your interest before his own. My business here is to proffer you the Count at the
head of 7000 Horse, and 2000 Foot, ready to receive your Orders, and seek out the E|nemy
as you please to direct. My request therefore is (and it is the request of my Ma|sters,
and his own) that as he has exceeded the number which he was obliged to bring in
to your service, so you would enlarge your reward; that neither he may repent of his en|terprize,
nor we be sorry we persuaded him.
These words of Neri's were heard with as much attention by the Senate, as if they had
been delivered from an Oracle, and so much was the auditory revived thereby, they had
not patience to let their Duke reply according to custom; but rising all of them upon their
feet, with their hands lifted up, and tears in their eyes, they gave the Florentines thanks
for the good office they had done them; and him, for the diligence and dexterity of his dis|patch;
promising that no time should ever obliterate it, not only in their own hearts, but
in the hearts of their posterity; and that their Country and themselves would always be at
the service of the Florentines. But the transport being over they fell into serious debate a|bout
the way the Count was to take, that bridges and all other conveniences might be pro|vided:
four ways there were before them. One from Ravenna, along the shore; but that
lying most upon the Sea, and the Fens; was not approved: the next was the direct way,
but obstructed by a Castle called the Ucellino which was garrison'd by the Duke, and to
be taken, before they could pass; and that could not be done in a short time without great
difficulty, and to be long about it would frustrate their relief in another place, which required
all possible expedition. The third way was by the forest of Lugo, but the Po being over-flown,
that was unpassable. The fourth was thorow the Country of Bologna, over the
bridges at Puledrano, Cento, and Picue, and so by Finale and Bondeno to Ferrara, from whence
partly by water, and partly by land, they might pass into the Country of Padua, and joyn
with the Venetian Army: this way also had its difficulties, and they were liable to be im|peded
by the Enemies Army; yet being chosen as the best; notice was given to the Count,
who departing with all imaginable speed, arrived in the Country of Padua on the 20th. of
Iune; the arrival of so great a Captain in Lombardy, revived the whole Government of
Venice; and whereas before they were almost desperate of their safety; they began now to
take courage, and expect new conquests upon the Enemy. The first thing the Count at|tempted,
was the relief of Verona, to prevent which, Nicolo marched with his Army to So|ave
(a Castle betwixt the Country, of Vicensa, and Verona) there he entrenched; throw|ing
up a ditch from Soave to the marches of Adice
The Count finding himself obstructed thorow the plain; resolv'd to march over the
mountains to Verona; presuming that Nicolo would either believe he could not pass that
way, by reason of its steepness and cragginess; or let him pass so, before he believed it, that
it would be too late to interrupt him. Wherefore, taking eight days provision along with
him, he march'd his Army over the Mountains, and at Soave came down into the plains.
And though Nicolo had thrown up some works to incommode him, yet they were too weak
to give him a stop. Nicolo finding the Enemy pass'd beyond his imagination; and fearing

to be forced to an engagement upon some disadvantage; he drew off to the other side of the
Aldice, and the Count, without farther obstacle, marched into Verona. Having overcome
the first difficulty, and relieved Verona, the next thing the Count was to attempt, was to
succour Brescia. That City is seated so near the Lake di Garda, that though it was blocked
up by land, yet the Lake was open, and they could supply themselves with provisions.
Upon that consideration, the Duke had put what force he could upon the Lake, and in the
beginning of his designs, had secured all the Towns which were capable of supplying them
by the benefit of the Lake.
The Venetians had Gallies likewise upon the Lake; but they were not strong enough
to encounter the Dukes. The Count thought it necessary with his Army to Land, to give
the Venetian Gallies some advantage upon the Water; and therefore he concluded to at|tempt
some of those Towns which lay conveniently for the famishing of Brescia, he clap'd
down therefore with his Army before Bandolino (a Castle standing upon the Lake) ho|ping
if he took that, the rest would surrender. But in that enterprize, his fortune deceived
him; for most of his Men falling sick, he was forced to raise the siege and remove his Ar|my
to Zemo, a Castle belonging to the Veronesi, where the air was more healthful, and the
Country more plentiful. The Count retired, Nicolo, not to slip the opportunity of making
himself Master of the Lake, left his Camp at Vegasio, and with a select party went to the
Lake where joyning with the rest, he fell so furiously upon the Venetian Squadron, that he
broke it quite, and took most of them Prisoners. Upon this Victory, most of the Castles
upon the Lake, surrender'd to the Duke. The Venetians, startled at this defeat, and fear|ing
left the Brescians should yield thereupon, they solicited the Count very earnestly, both
by letters, and Messages, that he would attempt to relieve them. The Count, perceiving
his hopes of doing it by the Lake, absolutely defeated, and his way by the fields impossible
by reason of the Trenches, and Bulwarks, which were so numerous and strong, and an Ar|my
to make them good, so that to venture among them would be inevitable destruction,
the way by the Mountains having been succesful to him at Verona, he resolved to try it
once more for the relief of Brescia. Having pitched upon his way, the Count departed
from Zeno, and by the Val d' Acri, marching to the Lake of St. Andrea, he pass'd to Forbo|li,
and Penda upon the Lake di Garda, from whence he advanced to Tenna, and sate down
before it; it being necessary that Castle should be taken before he could get into Brescia.
Nicolo having intelligence of his design,Nicolo Pic|cino defeated by the Count. marched his Army to Pischiera, and from thence
(joyning with the Marquess of Mantoua. and a commanded party of his best-men) he pro|ceeded
to engage the Count, who giving him battle, Nicolo was beaten; his Army dis|persed;
many of them taken Prisoners; and those which escaped, many of them fled to their
Camp, and many of them to the Fleet. Nicolo got off himself into Tenna, and night be|ing
come, concluding if he stayed till morning he could never get farther, to avoid a cer|tain
danger,Escapes to Tenna and from thence very strangely to his Army. he exposed himself to a doubtful. Of all his retinue, Nicolo had only one ser|vant
with him, a lusty stong German, and one that had always been very faithful to him.
Nicolo persuaded his German, that if he would put him into a sack, he might carry him off
to some secure place upon his shoulders, as some luggage of his Masters. The Enemy lay
round before the Castle, but (transported and secure upon their Victory the day before)
without any Order, or guards: by which means the German found no great difficulty in the
business, for putting himself into the habit of a freebooter, and Mounting his Master upon
his shoulders, he passed thorow their whole Camp, and brought him safe to his party. This
Victory, had it been improved as happily as it was gained, might have given more relief to
Brescia, and more felicity to the Venetians: but being ill managed, they had little reason to
exult, and Brescia remaining in the same necessity as before; for Nicolo was no sooner re|turned
to the forces which he had left behind, but he set all his wits to work which way he
might exploit some new thing to attone for his loss; and obstruct the relief of the Town:
he knew himself the situation of the Citadel of Verona, and had learned from the Prisoners
taken in that War: not only that it was ill guarded, but the way how it might easily be sur|prized:
he believed therefore that fortune had presented him with an opportunity of reco|vering
his honor, and converting his Enemies joy, into sadness and sorrow. Verona is in
Lombardy, seated at the foot of those Mountains which divide Italy from Germany; so that
it stands partly upon the Hill, and partly upon the plain; the River Adice rises in the vally
di Trento and running into Italy, does not extend himself immediately thorow the plains;
but banding to the left hand among the Mountains, it comes at length to the City; and
passes thorow the midst of it: yet not so as to divide it into equal parts, for towards the
plain it is much greater, then towards the Mountains: upon the rising part of the City,
there are two Castles, one of them called San Piero, and the other San Felice, which appear
stronger in their situation, than their walls; and do by it command the whole Town. In

the plain on this side the Adice, behind the wall of the City, there are two Fortresses about
a thousand paces distant one from the other; of which the one is called the old Citadel, and
the other the new. On the inside of one of them, there passes a wall to the other and is
(in respect of the other walls which fetch a compass) as the string to a bow. All the
space betwixt these two walls, is full of Inhabitants and called the Borg of San Zeno. These
two Castles and the Burg, Nicolo designed to surprize, believing it would be no difficult
matter, both because of the former negligence of the Guards (which he presumed after the
late Victory would be much greater) and of an opinion he had, that no enterprize was so
feasible as that which the Enemy believed was impossible to be done. Having drawn out
a party of choice Men in order to his design, he joyned with the Marquess of Mantoua, and
marching in the night to Verona, he scaled the new Citadel, and tooke it without being per|ceived,
and then forcing upon the Port di S. Antoine, the signal was given to his Horse,Verona sur|prized by Nico|lo
and they marched all of them into the Town. Those of the old Citadel who were upon
the Guard, hearing the noise when the Sentinels in the other Citadel were knock'd on the
head, and when the Gate of S. Antoine was broken up, believing it was the Enemy, cryed
out to the People to Arm; and fell a ringing their Bels. The Citizens taking the alarm,
came together in great Confusion! those of them who had most courage, got to their Arms,
and retreated with them to the Palace of the Rettori: in the mean time Nicolo's Souldiers
had plundered the Borgo di S. Zeno, and advancing towards the Town, the Citizens, per|ceiving
the Dukes forces was entred, and no way left to defend themselves: advised the
Venetian Rettori to retire into the fortresses, and preserve themselves and their goods, for
(as they said) it would be much better to do so, and attend better fortune; than by en|deavouring
to avoid the present danger, to be knock'd on the Head, and the whole City
pillaged: hereupon the Rettori, and all the Venetians betook themselves to the Castle of
S. Felice; and several of the principal Citizens went to meat Nicolo and the Marquess of
Mantoua to beg of them that they would rather possess that City rich, and with honor,
than poor to their disgrace; especially seeing they had not by an obstinate defence deserved
preferment from their old Masters, or hatred from their new. The Marquess and Nicolo
having encouraged them what they could, they protected them from plunder as much as
was possible; and because they were confident the Count would immediately address himself
to the recovery of the Town, they contrived with all imaginable industry to get the Fort in|to
their hands; but what they could not take, they block'd up with ditches and trenches
cut about to obstruct the Enemy from relieving them.
The Count Francesco was with his Army at Tenna, where upon the first report of this sur|prize,
he believed it but vain; afterwards understanding the truth, he resolved by a more
than ordinary speed to recompence his former negligence, and expiate its disgrace. And
though all the chief Officers of his Army advis'd him to give over his enterprize of Brescia,
and Verona, and retire to Vicenza, least otherwise the Enemy should encompass him where
he was, yet he would not consent; but resolved to try his fortune for the recovery of Ve|rona,
and turning about to the Venetian Proveditori, and Barnardetto de Medici (who assi|sted
as Commissioner for the Florentines) he encouraged them in their doubts and assured
them he would retake it if any of the castles held out for him. Having put all things in or|der,
and drawn out his Men, he marched towards Verona with all expedition: at first sight,
Nicolo imagined he was marching to Vicenza, as he had been counselled by his officers; But
observing him to march on, and direct his forces towards the Castle of S. Felice, he thought
it time to provide for his defence: but all was too late, the trenches, and embarrasments
were not finished; the Souldiers separated, and plundering, and could not be got together
time enough to hinder the Count from getting into the Citadel, and from thence into the
City, to the great disparagement of Nicolo, and detriment of his party, who with the Mar|quess
of Mantoua, retreated first into the Citadel which they had taken, and from thence e|scaped
to the City of Mantoua,Recovered by the Count. where rallying the remainder of their forces, they joyned
themselves with the Army before Brescia: so that in four days time Verona was won and lost
by the Duke forces. Being Winter time, and the weather very cold the Count having af|ter
his Victory, put in some supplies of victual into Brescia, though with very great diffi|culty,
he removed his quarters to Verona, having given order for the building certain Gal|lies
to Forboli that Winter, to be ready against the Spring, that then he might be so strong
both by land and by Water, as to give Brescia an effectual and total relief.
The Duke seeing the War at a stand for a time, and his hopes of being Master of Verona
and Brescia, at an end; all which he attributed to the Counsel and supplies of the Florentines,
whose affection could not be alienated, by all the provocations the Venetians had given
them; nor gained over to his side, by all the promises which he had made them; that they

might be sensible of their own oversight, and feel the inconveniences they had pulled upon
themselves, he resolved to invade Tuscany, to which he was much encouraged by Nicolo, and
the Florentine exiles. Nicolo's design was upon the possessions of Braccio, and to drive the
Count out of La Marca:The Duke encouraged in his expedition into Tuscany by Nicolo and the Florentine exiles. the other had an itching after their own Country, and a mind to
be at home, so that both parties animated the Duke with such arguments as were most sut|able
to their particular designs: Nicolo told him he might send him with an Army into Tus|cany,
and leave Brescia besieged; for he was Master of the Lake; was well entrenched about
the Town; had several strong Castles in the Country; and good Officers and Souldiers e|nough
to resist the Count, if he should make any attempt in another place; which was not
to be imagined till he had relieved Brescia, and that was impossible: so that if he pleased, he
might make War in Tuscany, and not quite his enterprize in Lombardy; he remonstrated
besides that the Florentines would be constrained, as soon as they saw him in Tuscany, to
call back the Count or be ruined; and whichsoever of the two happen, his Victory would
be certain,
The exiles, inculcated, that if Nicolo came near Florence with his Army, it was impos|sible,
but the People, tired out with their Taxes and the insolence of the Grandees, would take
arms and revolt; as to his passage to Florence, they promised it should be easie, and Casen|tino
open to them, by the interest and correspondence which Rinaldo held with that Gover|nor:
so that the Duke, inclinable of himself, was much fortified and encouraged by their
persuasions: the Venetians on the other side (though the Winter was very sharp) press'd
the Count to the relief of Brescia with his whole Army; but he refused, alledging it was not
to be done at that time; that better weather was to be expected, and that in the interim
their Fleet should be got ready and then it might be attempted both by Land and by Wa|ter:
which answer giving no satisfaction, the Venetians became slow, and remiss in send|ing
them provisions, so that in their Army many People died. The Florentines having ad|vertisement
of all these passages, were greatly dismaid; seeing the War brought home to
them of Tuscany, and that in Lombardy, not turn'd to account: nor were they less fearful
of the forces of the Church; not that the Pope was their Enemy, but that they found that
Army at the devotion of the Patriarch who was their implacable adversary:The Patri|arch of Alex|andria Gene|ral for the Pope. Giovanni Vitel|leschi
Cornetano was first Apostolical Notarie, then Bishop of Ricanati, after the Patriarch
of Alexandria, and being at last created Cardinal, was called the Cardinal of Florence;
This Cardinal was a cunning and Couragious Person, so capable of business that the Pope,
had a strong affection for him, gave him command of the forces of the Church, and in all
the Popes enterprizes in Tuscany, Romagna, Naples, and Rome, he was constantly his Ge|neral;
so that by degrees he gained so great authority both over the Army, and the Pope,
that the Pope began to be afraid to command him, and the Army, to refuse their obedience
to any body but he. The Cardinal being at that time in Rome, when the news arrived
that Nicolo was marching into Tuscany.
The fear of the Florentines was highly increased, because from the time of Rinaldo's ex|pulsion,The Patri|arch a friend to Rinaldo.
that Cardinal had been an Enemy to their state, for the Articles of agreement which
were, by his mediation procured in Florence, were not made good, but rather managed to
the prejudice of Rinaldo, he having been the occasion of his laying down his Arms,  that, the
occasion of his banishment; so that the Government of Florence began to fear the time was
come for the restauration of Rinaldo, if he joyned with Nicolo in his expedition into Tusca|ny
and their apprehensions were augmented by the sudden departure of Nicolo, who seemed
to them to leaven enterprize which he had almost compleated, to embark himself in ano|ther
ther that was more dangerous and doubtful: which they presumed he would never have
done, without some private intelligence, or unknown invitation: these their apprehensi|ons
they had infused into the Pope, who was grown sensible of his error in having transfer|red
so much Authority upon other People. But whilst the Florentines were in this suspence,
fortune presented them a way, to secure themselves of the Patriarch: that State had scouts
abroad to intercept, and peruse all letters, to see if they could meet with any correspondence
to the prejudice of the State; at Monte Pulciano it happened a pacquet was taken which the
Patriarch had written to Nicolo Piccinino without the knowledg or consent of the Pope.The Pope discovers intel|ligence betwixt the Patriarch and Nicolo, and resolves to secure him.
Though the Character was strange, and the sence so implicite and abstruse, that nothing
could be made out of it, yet that obscurity, considered with its directions to an Enemy, a|larmed
his Holiness so, as he resolved to secure him. The care of his apprehension he commit|ted
to Antonio Rido da Padoua, whom he had made Governor of the Castle of Rome. An|tonio
as soon as he had his orders, was ready to execute them, and expected an opportuni|ty.
The Patriarch had resolved to pass into Tuscany and having fixed upon the next day
for his departure from Rome, he sent to the Governor that he would be upon the bridge
next morning at a precise hour, for he had something to discourse with him: Antonio

thought now his opportunity was come, ordered his People as he thought convenient, and
at the time appointed was ready expecting the Patriarch upon the Bridge, which was to be
drawn up, or let down, as occasion required. The Patriarch was punctual, and came ex|actly
at his time,the Patri|arch secured and dies. and Antonio entertaining him a while upon the bridge, gave a sign, and on a
sudden the bridge was pulled up, and the Patriarch in the Castle; so that of the General of
an Army he became a Prisoner in a moment. The People which were with him, began
to swagger at first, but understanding afterwards it was his Holinesses direction, they were
pacified and quiet: and the Governor of the Castle comforting him with fair words, and
giving him hopes of a better condition, the Patriarch replyed, that great Persons were not
secured, to be discharged again; that those who deserved to be seized, did not deserve to be
dismissed, and it was his own case, for he died in Prison not long after, and Lodovico Pa|triarch
of Aquileia was made General of the Pope's Army in his place; who though before
he could not be engaged in the Wars betwixt the Duke and the League, yet then he was
persuaded; and promised to be ready for the defence of Tuscany, with 4000 Horse and
2000 Foot.
Being delivered from this danger, there was another of no less importance, and that was
their fear of Nicolo upon the confusion of affairs in Lombardy, and the differences betwixt
the Venetians and the Count: for better information, the Florentines sent Neri the Son of
Gino Capponi, and Guiliano d' Anazenti to Venice, as also to settle the prosecution of the
War for the next year, commanding Neri, upon the resolution of the Venetians, to repair
to the Count, to found his, and exhort him to such courses as should be necessary for the
security of the League: these Embassadors were scarce got onward on their way, as far as
Ferrara, before they had the news that Piccinino had passed the Po with 6000 Horse. There|upon
they made what haste was possible, and being come to Venice, they found that Senate
very positive to have Brescia relieved at that very time, not being (as they said) able to
attend any better, nor their state to put out any Fleet, so that without present supply, they
would be forced to surrender, which would compleat the Dukes successes, and be the loss of
all their Territories by Land: finding them so perverse, Neri went to Verona, to hear what ar|guments
the Count could produce to the Contrary, who with good reasons made it out to
him, that to endeavour the relief of Brescia in that juncture, would be not only ineffectual
at present, but much to their prejudice afterwards, for considering the season of the year,
and situation of the Town, nothing could be done, he should only harrass and disorder his
Men so, as when a proper time for action should come, he should be forced to draw of to
Verona to supply himself with what the Winter had consumed, and what was necessary for
their future support; so that all the time that was fit for action, would be spent in march|ing
backward and forward.Commissio|ners to the Count from the Venetians. To adjust these things, Orsalto Iustiniani, and Giovan Pisani were
sent to Verona to the Count, by whom it was concluded (after much dispute) that the
Venetians for the ensuing year should give the Count 80000. Ducats, and 40. a piece to the
rest of his Army. That he should march forth with his whole Army, and fall upon the
Duke, endeavouring by some smart impression upon his Country to make him recal Nicolo
out of Lombardy. After which conclusion, they returned to Venice, but the Venetians
(the sum being thought very great) went on but slowly with their preparations. Nicolo
Piccinino proceeded however, was got already into the Country of Romagna, and tampered
so successfully with the Sons of Pandolfo Malatesta, that they deserted the Venetians and took
up Arms under the Duke: this news was unpleasing at Venice, but at Florence much more;
because that way they thought to have given Nicolo a stop. But the Malatesti being in Re|bellion,
the Florentines were not a little dismaid, especially fearing, that their General Pie|ro
Giampagolo Orsino (who was then in the territories of the Malatesti) might be defeated,
and they by consequence disarmed:The Count desirous to fol|low Nicolo. these tidings, were also no small trouble to the Count,
who began to apprehend if Nicolo passed into Tuscany, he might be in danger of losing La Marca,
and (disposed to secure his own Country if he could) he came to Venice, and be|ing
introduced to the Duke, he declared to him. that his passage into Tuscany would be
convenient for the League, for the War was to be carried on, where the General, and Army
of the Enemy was, and not among their private, and particular Towns, and Garisons:
because their Army once beat, there is an end of the War; but though their Garrisons be
taken, and their Towns reduced, if their Army be intire, they should be never the nearer,
but the War (as it does many times happen) would break out more severely. Assuring
them that La Marca and all Tuscany would be lost if Nicolo was not briskly opposed; which
being lost, no remedy could be expected in Lombardy; but if it might, he did not under|stand
how he could with any excuse abondon his own Subjects and friends; for coming in|to
Lombardy a Prince, he should be loth to leave it as a private Captain. To this the Duke
of Venice replyed, that it was manifest, and nothing more certain, that if he left Lombardy,

and passed the Po with his Army,Dissuaded by the Duke of Venice. all their territories upon Land would be lost; and that it
would be to no purpose to consume more mony in defending it. For he can be no wise
Man who endeavours to defend that which he is sure to lose, and he no fool who chuses to
lose his Country alone, rather than his Country and Mony too, and if the loss of their af|fairs
should follow, it would then be clear enough how much it imported the reputation of
the Venetians, to protect Romagna and Tuscany. But the whole Senate was against his
opinion, believing if he succeeded in Lombardy, he should be sure every where else, and
that could be no hard task; that State, upon Nicolo's departure, being left weak and infirm,
so that that might be ruined, before Nicolo could be called back, or any other sufficient re|medy
provided. That if things were curiously examined, it would be found that Nicolo
was sent into Tuscany upon no other errand, but to divert the Count from his enterprize in
Lomberdy, and remove the War from his own Country by carrying it into another: so that
if the Count should pursue him without irresistable necessity, he would rather accomplish
his desgns, and do as he would have him: but if they continued their Army in Lombardy,
 shifted in Tuscany as well as they could; they would be sensible of their ill resolution
when it was too late, and find that they had lost all in Lombardy irrecoverably, without any
equivalence or reprisal in Tuscany.
 manner every Man having spoken, and replyed, as his judgment directed him;
it was concluded to be quiet for some days, to see what the agrement betwixt Nicolo and the
Malatesti would produce:They  to a resolution. whether the Florentines might rely upon Piero Giam Pagolo; and
whether the Pope proceeded fairly with the League as he had promised he would. This
lution bing taken, not long after, they had intelligence; that Piero Giam Pagolo was
 towards Tuscany with his Army; and that the Pope was better inclined to the
 at that time, than before; with which advertisements the Count being confirmed,
he was content to remain in Lombardy himself; that Neri should be dispatched thither with
a 1000 of his Horse, and five hundred others, and if things should proceed so, as that his
presence should be necessary in Tuscany; upon the left summons from Neri the Count en|gaged
to repair to him without any delay. Accordingly Neri marched away, arrived with
his forces at Florence in April, and the same day Giam Pagolo arrived there also; in the
mean time Nicolo Piccinino having settled the affairs of Romagna, was designing for Tuscany;
and being inclined to have marched by the way of the Alps of S. Benedetto, and the vale of
Montone, he found that passage so well defended by the conduct of Nicolo da Pisa, that
he believed his whole Army would not be able to force it: and because of the sudden|ness
of this irruption the Florentines were but indifferently provided either with Souldiers,
or Officers, they committed the passes of the other Alps to the guard of certain of their Citi|zens,
with some new raised Companies of Foot, among which Citizens Bartholomeo Or|landini
had the command, and more particularly the keeping of the Castle of Marradi, and
the pass that was by it. Nicolo Piccinino supposing the pass of S. Benedetto insuperable by
reason of the courage and vigilance of the Commander; chose rather to attempt the other
way where the cowardice and inexperience of the chief Officer was not like to give him so
great opposition. Marradi is a Castle built at the foot of those Alps which divide Tuscany
and Romagna; but on the side of Romagna, at the entrance into the Vale di Lamona though
it has no Walls, yet the River, the Mountains and the inhabitants make it strong. For the
Men are martial and faithful, and the River has worn away the bancks, and made such Grotes
and hollows therein, that it is impossible from the valley to approach it, if a little Bridge
which lies over the River be defended: and on the mountain side the Rocks and the Cliffs
are so steep, it is almost impregnable: but the pusillanimity of Bartolomeo debas'd the cou|rage
of his Men, and rendered the situation of his Castle of no importance: for no sooner
did he hear the report of the Enemies approach, but leaving all in confusion, away he ran
with his Party, and never stoped til he came at Borgo a San. Lorenzo. Nicolo (having posses'd
himself of that pass: strangely surprized to consider how poorly it had been defended; and
as much pleased that now it was his own) marched down into Mugello, and having taken
several Castles, he staid at Puliciano to refresh; from whence he made his excursions as far
as Monte Fiesole, and was so bold to pass the River Arno, scouring, forraging, and plun|dering
the Country within three miles of Florence. The Florentines however were not at all
dismaid, but the first thing they did was to secure the Government, of which they were
not much afraid both for the intrest which Cosimo had with the people; and the method
they had taken to reduce the chief Officers of the City into the hands of a few of the most po|tent
Citizens, who with their vigilance and severity kept under all such as were disconten|ted,
or studious of new things, besides they had news of the resolutions in Lombardy: of
Neri's approach; with the number of his forces, and that the Pope had promised to supply
them with more: which hopes were sufficient to support them till Neri's arrival. But Neri

finding the City in some disorders, resolved to take the field, and restrain Nicolo from fo|raging
so freely: and therefore drawing together, what Infantry he could, out of the People,
he joyned them with his Horse, marched into the field, and took Remole, which the Ene|my
had possess'd. After the taking of that Town, he encamped his Army there; obstru|cted
the excursions of Nicolo; and gave the City great hopes of sending him farther off. Ni|colo
observing, though the Florentines had lost many of their Men, it procured no commoti|on;
and understanding they were all quiet and secure in the Town, he concluded it vain to
lose time any longer,The Count Poppi revolts from the Florentine. wherefore he changed his designs, and resolved to do something which
might cause the Florentines to provoke him to a Battle, in which he doubted not to over|come,
and then all things would follow as he expected, of course. there was at that time in
Nicolo's Army, Francesco Conte di Poppi who (when the Enemy was in Mugello) revolted
from the Florentines, with whom he was in League, the Florentines had a jealousie of him
before and endevoured to continue him their friend, by enlarging his pay, and making
him there Deputy over all the Towns which were near him, but nothing could do, so
strongly did his affection incline him to the other party, that no fear, nor act of kindness
what ever was sufficient to divide him from Rinaldo, and the rest of the Brethren, who had
had the Government formerly: so that he no sooner heard of Nicolo's approach, but he
went in to him immediately, and solicited him with all imaginable importunity to advance
towards the City and march into Casentino; discovering to him the whole strength of the
Country, and with what ease and security he might straiten the Enemy. Nicolo took
his Counsel, and marching into Casentino, he possess'd himself of Romena, and Bibiena, and
afterwards encamped before Castle San Nicolo. That Castle is placed at the foot of those Alps
which divide Casentino from the vale of Arno; and by reason it stood high, and had a
strong Garison in it, it was no easie matter to take it, though Nicolo ply'd it continually
with his Cannon.
This siege continued twenty days, during which time the Florentines had got together
what force they could, and had already under several Officers 3000 foot at Fegghine,
commanded by Piero Giam Pagolo as General; Neri Capponi, and Bernardo de Medici as
Commissioners. The Castle of San Nicolo had sent out four Persons to give them notice of
their Condition, and press them for relief: whereupon the Commissioners examining the
situation of the place, found it was not to be relieved but by the Alps which came down
from the Vale of Arno, the tops of which might easily be possess'd by the Enemy, before
they could come at them, in respect they had a shorter cut to them, and the Florentines
could not stir, but they must of necessity be seen: so that to attempt a thing which was not
like to succeed, was to expose and cast away their Men without doing any good: upon
these considerations the Commissioners having commended their courage pass'd, advised
them to continue it whilst they were able, and when they found they could hold it no lon|ger,
to surrender upon as good termes as they could: hereupon after 32 days siege Nico|lo
became Master of the Castle, but the losing so much time upon so inconsiderable a place,
was (in great part) the miscarriage of that enterprize: for had he invested Florence, or
but keep it blocked up at a distance, the Governor of that City would have been constrai|ned
to raise Mony, and Men, and must have supplied it with provisions, with much more
difficulty, having the Enemy so near them, besids many would have been pressing for peace
seeing the War so likely to continue: but the desire the Count di Poppi had to be revenged of
that Garison (which had been his Enemy a long time) caused him to give that Counsel,Nicolo illadvised by Count Poppi.
and Nicolo to oblige him, consented to it, which was the destruction of both: and indeed it sel|dom
happens, but private animosity, proves a prejudice to the interest of the publick. Ni|colo,
pursuing his Victory, took Passina and Chiusi, and the Count di Poppi persuaded him
to continue in those parts, alledging that he might extend his Quarters betwixt Chiusi, and
Pieve as he pleased, and making himself Master of the Alps, he might as he saw occasion,
return to the old post in Casentino and the Vale Arno, or falling down into Vale di Chi|ana
and the Vale de Fevere, be ready upon the least motion of the Enemy. But Nicolo re|flecting
upon the rockiness of those places, only he replyed his Horses could swallow no
stones, and removed to Borgo a S. Sepulcro where he was received with all demonstration of
kindness, from whence he endeavoured to debauch the Citizens of Castello, but they were
too firm to the Florentines to entertain any such motion. Being desirous to have Perugia
(where he was born) at his devotion, he went either with 40 Horse to make them a vi|sit,
and was honorably treated, but in a few days he rendred himself suspected, having been
wheedling with the Legate and several of the Citizens, and made many proposals to them,
but none of them succeeded; so that receiving 8000 Ducats of them, he returned to his
Army.
After this he got intelligence in Cortona, and was very busie in seducing it from the Flo|rentines,

but being discovered before it was ripe, that also came to nothing. Among the
principal of that City there was on Bartolomeo di senso,Nicolo prac|tises to surprize Crotona. who going the Rounds one night by
the Captains order, was told by a Country Man his friend, that if he had no mind to be kil|led,
he should have a care, and go back. Bartolomeo pressing to know his reason; he found
the whole series of the Plot, and went immediately to the Governor, and acquainted him:
how, seizing upon the Conspirators, and doubling his Gurards thereupon, expected the
coming of Nicolo according to agreement, who came indeed punctually at his time, but find|ing
himself descovered, returned to his quarters. Whilst things ware carried on in Tuscany at
this rate, with little advantage to the forces of the Duke, his affairs in Lombardy were as un|quiet,
but with more detriment and loss, for Count Francesco as soon as the season gave
leave, took the field with his Army, and the Venetians having repaired their fleet in the
Lake, he thought it best in the first place to make himself Master of that, and to drive the
Duke out; supposing when he had done that, the rest would be easie. Whereupon he
caused the Venetian. Fleet to set upon the Dukes; which they did, and defeated them; after
which he took all the Castles which they had in their possession,Brescia relived. so that the Enemy which
besieged Brescia by land, understanding the destiny of their Comerades, drew of from the
siege; and left the Town free, after it had been straitned three years. Having finished
his business there, and obtained so important a Victory, the Count thought it to seek out
the Enemy, who was retired to Socino, a Castle upon the River of Oglio, and dislodging
them there, they retreated to Cremona: where the Duke made a head, and resolved to de|fend
that part of his Country. But the Count advancing daily against him; being fear|ful
he should lose all, or a great part of his Territory, he began to lament the resolution of
sending Nicolo into Tuscany; and to redress his error, he writ word to Nicolo of the condi|tion
he was in, pressing him with all speed to come back to his relief. The Florentines in
the mean time had joyned their forces with the Popes, and made a halt at Anghiari a Castle
at the foot of the mountains which part Val di Tevere, from Valdichiana, four miles distant
from San Sepulcro; betwixt which places the way was plain, the Country champain, sit
for Horse, and proper for a Battle. Having heard of the Counts Victory, and that Nico|lo
was recalled, they thought the Victory might be obtained without more hazard or labour,
and therefore orders was dispatched in all haste to the Comissaries to avoid an engagement by
all means; for Nicolo could not stay in Tuscany many days. These orders coming to Ni|colo's
ear, finding that of necessity he must part; that he might have left nothing untryed,
he resolved to provoke them to a Battle, believing he should take them unprovided, seeing
(according to their intelligence) they could have no reason to expect any such thing; and
to this he was much encouraged by Rinaldo, the Conte di Poppi, and all the Florentine ex|iles,
who knew well enough they were undone if Nicolo departed; but if they could bring
them to a fight, there was a possibility of prevailing, and if they did lose the Victory, they
should lose it with honor.
This resolution being taken, the Army moved; and being advanced as far as Borgo be|fore
the Florentines perceived it, he commanded 2000 Men out of that City, who, (rely|ing
much upon the conduct of their General, and the promises he made them,
being also desirous of plunder) followed him chearfully. Marching on from thence di|rectly
towards Anghiari in Battalia, Nicolo arrived with his whole Army within two
miles, when Micheletto Attendulo perceiving a great dust, and suspecting it to be the Ene|my,
cryed out to have all People stand to their Arms. The tumult in the Florentine
Camp was not small;The Battle of Anghiari. for that Army encamped ordinarily without any Discipline, and be|ing
negligent besides, in presumption the Enemy were further off, they were fitter to fly than
to fight; all of them being disarmd, and straggled from their quarters into such places as the
shade, or their recreations had carried them. Nevertheless so much diligence was used by
the Commissaries, and the General, that before the Enemy could get up, they were on
Horseback, and in order to receive them; and as Micheletto was the first that discovered
them, so he was the first that engaged them; running with his Troop to secure the Bridge
which crossed the way not far from Anghiari. Micheletto having posted himself at the
Bridge, Simomino an Officer of the Popes, and his Legate, placed themselves on the right
hand, and the Florentine Commisaries, and General on the left; having planted the foor as
thick as possible upon the banks; there was only one way for the Enemy to attack them and
that was by the bridge; nor had the Florentines any where to defend themselves but there; only
they ordered their foot, that if the Enemies foot, should leave the high way, and fall upon
the flanks of the Horse; they should let fly at them with their; Crossbows, and give their
Cavalry a secure passage over the Bridge.
The first that appeared, were gallantly received by Micheletto, and repulsed; but Astor
re, and Francesco Piccinino coming in with a commanded party, to their relief, they char|ged

him so briskly, that Micheletto was not only beat back over the Bridge, but pursued to
the very end of the Town, and they which pursued them being charged again in the Flank,
were repulsed over the Bridge, and all things as at first. This skirmish continued two
hours compleat: sometimes Nicolo, and sometimes the Florentines being Masters of the
Bridge; and though the fight upon the Bridge was equal to both, yet on this side and the
other, Nicolo had much the disadvantage. For Nicolo's men passing the Bridge were re|ceived
by a gross of the Enemy, which being drawn up with advantage by reason of the
ground, could charge, or wheel, or relieve those that were distressed as they saw occasi|on.
But when the Florentines passed over, Nicolo had no place to relieve his Men for
the ditches and banks in the way, as it appeared in the conflict; for though Nicolo's forces
gained the Bridge several times, yet by the fresh supplies of the Enemy they were still for|ced
to give back: but when the Florentines prevailed, and passed over the Bridge, Nicolo
had not time, by reason of the briskness of their charge, and the incommodity of the ground
to reinforce his Men,Piccinino de|feated. but those which were behind were forced to mix with those that were
before, one disordered the other, and the whole Army was constrained to fly, and every
Man got to Bargo as well as he could. The Florentines let them go, as having more incli|nation
to the plunder, which in Horses, Arms, and other things afforded them a plenti|ful
prey; for with Nicolo there escaped not above 1000 Horse, most of the rest being taken
Prisoners: the Citizens of Borgo who had followed Nicolo for prize became prize them|selves,
and were most of them taken; with all their carriages and colours: this victory was
not so much prejudicial to the Duke, as it was advantageous to Tuscany, for had the Flo|rentines
lost the Day, that Province had been his; but he losing it, lost nothing but his Arms
and his Horses, which a little money would recruit. Never was there any War made in
an Enemies Country with less execution than in this, for in so great a rout, and so sharp
an engagement, which lasted four hours, there was but one Man slain, and he not by any
wound or honorable exploit, but falling from his Horse he was trodden to Death: with
such security did they fight then; for all of them being cuirashers on Horseback, and com|pleatly
armed, they could not presently be killed, and if they found there was no likely|hood
of getting off themselves, or being rescued by their friends, they surrendred before
they could come at them to slay them: this Battel both in it self and consequences, was a
great instance of the unhappiness of that War; for the Enemy being beaten, and Nicolo
fled to Borgo, the Commissioners would have pursued, and besieged him in that place, to
have made there Victory intire: But some of the Officers and Souldiers would not obey;
pretending they would dispose of their plunder, and cure themselves of their wounds, and
which is more remarkable the next day about noon without any regard to, or leave from their
superior Officers, they went to Arezzo; deposited their prey; and returned to Anghiari
when they had done.
A thing so contrary to all order and military discipline, that the reliques and remainder
of any well governed Army would easily have rob'd them of their Victory, which so unde|servedly
they had obtained. And besides this, the Commissioners giving order that all pri|soners
should be kept (to prevent their rallying, or getting together again) in spight of
their Orders, they dismiss'd them all. A thing most justly to be admir'd, that an Army so
constituted, should be able to get the Victory, and that the Enemy should be so poor spi|rited
as to be beaten by them. Whilst the Florentines therefore were marching to Arezzo
and returning again, Nicolo had opportunity to quit Borgo, and draw off all his Men
towards Romagna; and with him the Florentine exiles, who seeing their hopes desperate of
returning to Florence they dispersed themselves into all parts of Italy, and some of them
into other Countries, as their conveniences prompted them, of these Rinaldo chose Anco|na
for his residence, and afterwards (to obtain a mansion in Heaven, for that which he
had lost upon Earth) he went to visit the Sepulchre of our Saviour; from whence being re|turned,
as he was sitting at Table very merry at the Wedding of one of his Daughters,
he fell down on a sudden, and died. His fortune being favourable so far, as to take him
away in one of the most pleasant days of his Life; a man truly honorable in all conditions,
but would have been much more, had his Stars brought him forth in a City that had been
united; for Florence being factious, the same things disgusted there, which would have
been rewarded in another place. The Commissaries when their Men were come back
from Arezzo, and Nicolo departed, presented themselves before Borgo; whereupon the
Townsmen would have surrendred to the Florentines, but could not be accepted: in this
Treaty and negotiation, the Commissaries became jealous of the Popes Legate, lest he
had a design for seizing it for the Church; so that they came to ill language, and doubtless
some ill accident would have happened, had those proposals proceeded: the Popes Le|gate
being gratified in his desires: that controversie fell to the ground. Whilst they were so

solicitous for the enterprize of Borgo, news came that Nicolo Piocinino was marched towards
Rome but others said towards La Marca, wherefore the Legate, and many of the rest, gave
their opinions to march towards Perugia, to be ready to defend either Rome or La Marca,
whither Nicolo was fled with Bernat do de Medici; and Neri, with the Florentine, were
to march for Casentino: this being determined, Neri departed with his forces to Rassina;
took it, and Bibina, Prato Vecchio, and Romeni; from thence he marched to Poppi, and
besieged it on two sides;Poppi besieged. one towards the plain of Certomondo; and the other upon the
mountain that goes along to Fronzoli. Count Poppi seeing himself forsaken both by God
and Man, had shut himself up in Poppi, not with any hopes of relief, but to make his con|ditions
so much the better; and Neri coming before it, and forming his siege; he desired
a parly, and had as good terms offered, as in his state could be expected, which were to go
away himself, and his Children, with what ever they could carry with them, for
which the Town, and its Territory was to be delivered to the Florentines; whilst the
Treaty was managing, he came down to the Bridge over the Arno which is at the end of the
Town, and calling to Neri, in great sorrow and affliction he said to him,
Had I considered my own ill fortune,Poppi's speech to the Florentine Comissaries. and your power as I should have done, I had
been now as  friend congratulating your victory, and not supplcating your Mercy as an
Enemy. Fortune at present is favourable and propitious to you: to me it is rigid and
severe; I had Horses and Arms, and Subjects, and Estate, and who can wonder if I
part with them unwillingly? but if you please (as you may) to command all Tuscany,
we must of necessity obey: I have this only to comfort me, that had not I committed
this error, such would not have been that exercise nor demonstration of your Generosity,
for if now you should think fit to preserve me, you will leave to the World an indelible in|stance,
and example of Clemency: let therefore your compassion exceed my offence, and
permit at least that this single residence may continue to those from whom your prede|cessors
have received formerly many obligations.
Neri replyed,Neri's answer. That he had unhappily placed his hopes upon People which could do him
no good. That he had transgressed so highly against the Republick of Florence, that as
things then stood, there was a necessity of yielding up all, and that he must abandon those
places, as he was an Enemy to Florence, which as a friend he had refused to preserve; for
he had given so ill a Testimony and example of himself, That he could not be continu|ed;
and in every chance of fortune had been so unconstant and various, that they could not
have any confidence but that still be would be working to the prejudice of their state, and
yet it was not so much him, as his interest they were afraid of. But if he would with|draw
into Germany, the Government of Florence would intercede, that he might reside
there as a Prince and be a friend to him, for the obligations he said they had received
from his Ancestors. To which the Count answered in great passion, that he would be
farther off the Florentines than so, and laying aside all further Capitulation (seeing no re|medy)
the Count Delivered up the Town, and all his other concerns to the Florentines;
only his goods, his Wife and Children departed with him, very disconsolate, for having
lost a Dominion which his predecessors had enjoyed above 400 years. These successes be|ing
known in Florence, were received with great joy and acclamation, both by the Ma|gistrates
and People. And because Barnardetto de Medici, found that Nicolo's marching
towards Rome or La Marca would be of little importance, he returned with his forces to
Neri, and both of them coming back to Florence, it was resolved that they would be enter|tained
with the highest honors which could be conferred by that City, upon their victori|ous
members, and accordingly they were received in a Triumphant manner, by the Senate
the Captains of the Parties, and the whole City beside.



THE
HISTORY
OF
FLORENCE.
Book VI.
IT always was (and 'tis reasonable it be) the design and end of all those who make war,
to enrich themselves, and impoverish the Enemy; nor is conquest and victory desir|ed
upon any other score, but to magnifie the one, and to depress the other: hence it is,
that when ever victory impoverishes or debilitates you, you have either transgressed, or
fallen short, of what you aimed at in the War. That Prince, or Commonwealth is
enriched by Victory, when he exirpateth his Enemy, and impropriats the spoil. On the
other side, his Victory impoverishes him, when (though he overcomes his Enemy) he can|not
utterly extinguish him, and the spoil and prey is left to the Souldiers. This Prince,
this Commonwealth is unhappy in its losses, but more in its victories; for being defeated,
it is lyable to the injuries of its Enemies; and being victorious, to the contumely of its
friends, which as they are less reasonable, are less supportable, seeing it is again necessitated to
oppress and disgust its subjects by new impositions and taxes: and if there be the least hu|manity
in Government, it cannot rejoyce or exult in a victory, which makes all its sub|jects
sad. The well Governed Commonwealths of old, were wont to fill their Bags with
Gold and Silver; destribute donatives, remit subsidies and tribute to the people and so|lemnize
their victories with merriment and feasting; but those of whom we write, drain|ed
their Exchequer, impoverished the people, and never secured themselves of their Ene|mies;
which proceeded from the disorders in the management of the War; for having
beaten, and pillaged the Enemy, they neither kept them Prisoners, nor killed them; so
that (being incensed) they forbate revenging themselves upon the Conqueror no longer
than he which cammanded them could recruit them with Horses and Arms: and the plun|der
and ransoms falling to the Souldiers, the Conquerours made no advantage of the spoils
of the Enemy, but were forced to tear their supplies out of the bowels of their Subjects; no|thing
of benefit accurring to the people, they were rendred more imperious and cruel in
their taxes: and those Souldiers had brought things to that pass, that both the Conqueror
and conquered (if they intented to preserve their authority over their Men) were in ne|cessity
of more money; for the one side was to be recruited, the other to be rewarded; and
as the one could not fight, unless he was newly equipped; so the other would not engage
him without recompence for what was passed; from whence it happened, that one side had
no great joy of its victory; and the other no great sence of its loss; for the conquered had
time to recruit, and the Conqueror had none to pursue. This disorder and perversness in

the Souldier was the reason that Nicolo was recruited, and on Horse back again, before his
defeat was known thorow Italy; and sharper war he made upon his Enemies afterwards,
than he had ver done before. This it was, that after his rout before Brescia, enabled him to
surprize Verona: this it was, that after he was worsted at Verona, gave him opportunity to
invade Tuscany; this it was, that after his loss at Anghiari, recruited him again, and made
him stronger in the field (ere he got to Romagna) than he was before, which gave the
Duke new hopes of defending Lombardy, though by means of his absence he had looked
upon it as lost: for whilst Nicolo was giving the Enemy an alarm at Tuscany the Duke of
Milan was reduced to a condition of hazarding all, and therefore apprehending he might
be undone, before Nicolo (who was sent for) would come to his rescue, to stop the Ca|reer
of the Count, and temper his fortune by industry, which he could not do by force; he
had recourse to those remedies which in the like case he had many times used and sent Ni|colo
da Esti Prince of Ferrara to Peschiera to the Count, to persuade him in his name to a
Peace;The Duke proposeth a peace. and to remonstrate to him that the prosecution of the War could not turn to his ad|vantage;
for if the Duke should be distressed, and unable to maintain his eputation, the Count
would be the first which would suffer by it; by reason the Venetians and Florentines would
have no farther occasion, and by consequence no farther esteem for him: and as a testimony
of the sincerity of his proposal, the Duke offered to commate, his Marriage, and send his
Daughter to Ferrara to be delivered to him as soon as the peace was concluded; to which
the Count replied, that if the Duke did truly desire peace, he might easily have it; for the
Venetians and Florentines were as much inclined to it as he, but the difficulty would be to
persuade them he was in earnest, as knowing he would never have proposed any such thing,
had not some necessity constrained him; and as soon as that should be removed, he would
make War upon them again.
As to the business of his Marriage, he could not repose any confidence in his promise, ha|ving
been so often baffled by him before: nevertheless, if every thing else were agreed, he
should proceed in it as his friends should advise. The Venetians, who are jealous of their
Souldiers, where they have no reason to be so, had reason enough to be suspicious here,
which the Count being desirous to remove, prosecuted the War with all diligence imagi|nable;
but his mind was so inflamed with ambition, and the Venetians so slack, and inte|pidated
with jealousie, little more was done that Summer: so that when Nicolo Piccinino
returned into Lombardy, Winter came on, and the Armies were sent to their Winter quar|ters.
The Count to Verona; the Duke to Cremona: the Florentines into Tuscany, and the
Popes Army to Romagna, which after the Battle of Anghiari, assaulted Furli and Bologna in
hopes to have taken them from Francesco Piccinino, who kept them from his Father, and
defended them so well, they could not get them out of his hands; nevertheless their com|ing
into those parts so terrified the people of Ravenna that to avoid the domination of the
Church by consent of Osasio di Potenta their Lord, they submitted to the Venetian, who
(in recompence of his kindness, that he might never recover by force, what he had given
them with so little discretion) sent Ostasio with his only Son to spend their days in Candia,
where they died: in which expedition his Holiness wanting Mony, (notwithstanding the
Victory at Anghiari) he was glad to sell the Castle of Borg a San Sepulcro to the Floren|tines
for 25000 Ducats.The ingrati|tude of the Ve|netians.
Things being in this posture, and all sides thinking themselves safe as long as it was
Winter; all thoughts of peace were laid aside, especially by the Duke, who thought him|self
doubly safe, both in the season of the year, and the arrival of Nicolo; had therefore
broke of his Treaty with the Count a little abruptly; and in great haste rigged out Nicolo
again with all provisions and accoutrements that were necessary for the War: the Count
having notice of his preparations, went to Venice to consult the Senate how affairs were to
be ordered the next Summer. When Nicolo was ready (perceiving the Enemy out of or|der)
he never staid for the spring, but in the coldest of the Winter he passed the Adda,
and Acri, surprized 2000 Horse, and took most of them prisoners: but that which touch|ed
the Count nearest and startled the Venetians, was the defection of Ciarpellone one of his
principal officers, who went over to the Duke: the Count had no sooner the news, but he
left Venice; and coming with all possible speed to Brescia, he found Nicolo retired, and gone
back to his former station: the Count had no mind, finding the Enemy gone, to follow him
at that time; but chose rather to defer, till some advantage should tempt him, and give
him opportunity to revenge himself: he prevailed therefore with the Venetians to recal the
forces they had in the Florentine service in Tuscany; and to confer the command of them
upon Micheletto Attendulo, Gattamelata being dead. The spring being come, Nicolo Pic|cinino
was first in the field,Micheletto General for the League. and beseiged Cignano, a Castle some twelve miles distant from
Brescia: to the relief of which, the Count addressed himself; and betwixt these two Gene|rals

the War was managed as formerly. The Count being fearful of Bergamo, went with
his Army and encamped before Martinengo, a Castle which (if taken) lay very conveni|ent
for the succouring of Bergaino (which City was by Nicolo greatly distressed) who find|ing
he could not easily be disturbed, but by the way of Martinengo, had supplied it plenti|fully
with all things, so as the Count was forced to besiege it with all his Army: whereupon
Nicolo marched with his forces where he might most conveniently incommode him, and in|trenched
himself so strangely, the Count could not (without manifest danger) assail him
so that thereby he brought things to that pass that the besieger was in more distress, than
the besieged; and the Count than the Castle. For the Count could neither keep the siege
for want of provisions, nor rise, for fear of Nicolo's Army; and every body expected vi|ctory
for the Duke, and destruction for his Enemy: but fortune, (which never wants
ways of favoring her friends, and disobliging her Enemies) brought it about that Nicolo
in confidence of his Victory was grown so insolent haughty, that without respect to the
Duke, or himself, he sent him word that he had served him a long time, and as yet not
gained so much ground as would bury him when he died; he desired therefore to know
what recompence he was to expect for all his dangers, and fatigues; for it being now in his
power to make him absolute Master of Lombardy and to put all his Enemies into his hands,
he thought it but reasonable, as he was certain of his Victory,Nicolo's inso|lence to the Duke. to be secured of his reward;
and therefore he did propose he might have the City of Piacenza made over to him, that
when he had tired and worn himself out in his Wars, he might have that Town for his re|cess;
and at the last he took the boldness to threaten the Duke with the quitting his enter|prize,
if he was not gratified in his demands. This contumelious and insolent way of ca|pitulation,
was so offensive, and detestable to the Duke, that he resolved to lose all, rather
than comply; so that this arrogance in Nicolo wrought an effect upon him, to which the
Arms nor the minaces of the Enemy could never reduce him; and that was to make
peace with the Count, to whom he sent Guido Buone da Fortona with proposals of peace;
and the proffer of his Daughter; which was embraced with both Arms by the Count and
his Collegues.
All being privatly agreed among themselves;Peace betwixt the Duke and the Count. the Duke sent a message to Nicolo to re|quire
him to make a Truce with the Count, for a twelve month; pretending his treasure
was low, and had been so exhausted with the War, that he could not but prefer a certain
Peace, before a Victory that was doubtful. Nicolo admired his resolution, as not able to
imagine what should make him reject so glorious a Victory; not in the least suspecting, that
he bogled at the remuneration of his friends, and chose rather to let his Enemies escape; so
that not obeying him readily, the Duke was constrained to threaten, that without imme|diate
compliance, he would deliver him up as a prey for his own Souldiers, and his Enemy.
Whereupon Nicolo submitted, but with the same alacrity as on that is forced to forsake both
his Country and friends; complaining, and lamenting his unhappiness, whose Victory over
his Enemies was always interrupted either by his fortune, or the Duke. The truce being
made, the Marriage betwixt Madona Bianca and the Count was consummated, and the City
of Cremona given to her in Dower:1441 after which, the peace was concluded in November 1441
at which for the Venetians, Francesco Barbadico, and Pagolo Frono; for the Florentines Agno|lo
Acciailo were present; the Venetians got by this peace Peschiera, Asola, and Leonata a
Castle belonging to the Marquess of Mantoa.
The Wars in Lombardy being ended, the only part of Italy where there was any Hostility,
was in the Kingdom of Naples, which not being able to be composed, was the occasion of
new troubles in Lombardy. During the Wars in those parts, Alfonso of Aragon had over|run
the whole Kingdom of Naples, and left the King of Rinato nothing at all but the Country
about the Metropolis. Whereupon Alfonso conceiving the Victory already in his hands,
resolved whilst he besieged Naples, to seize upon Benevento, and the rest of the Towns
which were yet remaining to the Count in those Countries, supposing it might be done with|out
much danger, the Count himself being imployed in Lombardy; and his design succeed|ed
as easily as he imagined; for he took all his Towns with little or no opposition. But
the news arriving of the peace in Lombardy, Alfonso, began to apprehend lest the Count
(to recover what he had lost) should joyn with Rinato, and Rinato being of the same opi|nion,
sent to invite, and solicite the Count, that he would come, and revenge himself of
his Enemy, by relieving his friend. On the otherside Alfonso was as earnest with the
Duke, that in respect of the friendship which was betwixt them, he would give the Count
some diversion, and by imploying him in greater affairs, enforce him from undertaking of
this. Philippo entertained the motion very readily; not considering it intrenched upon
that peace, which not long before he had concluded with so much prejudice to himself: he
caused therefore to be signified to the Pope Egenius, that then was the time to recover the

Towns which the Count had taken from the Churches, and for his easier success, he prof|fered
him Nicolo Piccinino (who was in his pay) during the War, but discharged upon
the peace, and was at that time in Romagna with his forces: the Pope received the propo|sition
very joyfully upon a double account, both as he hated Francesco, and desired his own,
and though he had been cheated by Nicolo once before, yet now the Duke interposing, he
could not suspect him in the least; joyning his forces therefore with Nicolo's, he marched
into la Marca: the Count being much alarm'd at the news, got what strength together he
could, and went to encounter them.
In the mean time Alfonso took Naples;Naples ta|ken by Alfonso. and all that Kingdom fell into his hands except
Castelnuovo: Rinato having left a strong Garison in Castelnuovo, went away himself
for Florence, where he was most honorably received, but finding he was not able to con|tinue
the war, he stayed there but some certain days, and away he passed to Marsilia; du|ring
which time Alfonso had taken Castelnuovo, and the Count was got into La Marca, but
not so strong as the Pope and Nicolo: wherefore he addressed himself to the Venetian, and
Florentine, for assistance both of men and mony; representing to them that unless they now
looked upon them, and did something to restrain the Pope and Alfonso, whilst he was in
being, afterwards they would have enough to do to secure themselves; for they might joyn
with Duke Philip, and divide all Italy betwixt them: for some time both Venetian and
Florentine suspended their answer, either because they were unwilling to make his Holi|ness,
and Alfonso their Enemies; or else, because their hands were already full in Bologna.
Hannibal Bentivoglio had driven Francesco Piccinino out of that City, and to enable himself
to defend it against the Duke (who was a favourer of Francesco) he had desired the assi|stance
of the Venetians and Florentines; and they not denied it. Whilst the affairs in Bo|logna
were in this manner uncertain, they could not resolve to give the Count their assi|stance;
but Hannibal defeating Francesco afterwards, so that all things there seemed to be
composed, they then concluded to supply him. Yet first to secure themselves against the
Duke, they renewed the League with him, to which the Duke was not averse, for though
he had consented to the War against the Count, whilst Rinato was in the field; yet now
Rinato was routed, and his whole Kingdom taken from him, he had no mind the Count
should be destroyed likewise: and to that end he nto only consented to the aid which they
desired, but he writ to Alfonso to draw his forces back again into Naples, and not to pro|secute
the War there any longer; to which, although Alfonso was very unwilling, yet in
respect of his obligations to the Duke, he quietly consented, and drew off his Army to the
other side of Trento.
Whilst things were in this posture in Romagna, the Florentines were not unanimous at
home: among the Citizens of chiefest reputation and authority in that Government, Neri
the Son of Gino Capponi was one, of whose interest Cosimo de Medici was most particularly
jealous, in respect of the great vogue he had both in the City, and Army: for having a
long time had the Command of the Florentine forces, he had gained them exceedingly by his
courage and deportment: besides the many great services performed by him and his father
(the Father having taken Pisa, and the Son defeated Nicolo at the Battle of Anghiari)
were fresh upon the memory, and caused him to be beloved by most people, but dreaded
by such as were fearful of more Companions in their Government. Amongst other of their
principal Officers, there was one Baldaccio d' Anghiari an excellent Souldier; not to be
surpassed,Baldaccio Ge|neral of the Flo|rntine foot. either for courage or conduct in all Italy at that time: having always command|ed
their foot, he had gained so great influence upon them, that it was generally believed,
with him they would undertake any enterprize what ever, when ever he desired them.
This Baldaccio was a great lover of Neri, of whose bravery and prudence he had all along
been a witness, which to the rest of the Grandees, gave great occasion of suspicion; and think|ing
with themselves that to let him alone would be dangerous, but to imprison him much
more; they resolved to make him away, and fortune eflected it. Bartolomeo Orlandini
was at that time Gonfaloniere di Giustitia: who having been sent to keep the pass at Marradi
(as was said before) when Nicolo Piccinino made his inroad into Tuscany, had most base|ly
deserted it, and exposed a Country which was almost inaccessible of it self. Baldaccio
was so much provoked, or rather ashamed at his cowardice, that he spake slightly of him,
and writ several letters expressing his contempt; which Bartolomeo resenting highly, and
being conscious it was true; he resolved to be revenged, and expiate his own fault with the
death of his accuser: his resolution being known to other of his Enemies, they encouraged
him to proceed, and at one blow to revenge himself for the injury he had received; and de|liver
the state from a person they could neither retain without danger, nor dismiss without
ruine. Having fixed upon his way Bartolomeo shut up several armed Men one day in the
Chamber; and Baldaccio being come to the Piazza (as he constantly did) to discourse
with the Magistrats, and quire orders for his conduct, the Gonfaloniere sent to speak

speak with him, and he presently obeyed: seeing him coming, the Gonfaloniere went to
meet him, and entertained him about his affairs three or four turns in the Senators Cham|ber;
but at length having drilled him near the Chamber where his ambush was laid, he
gave the Signal, and all of them rushing upon him (who was alone, and without arms)
they killed him, and threw him out of the Palace window which looks towards the Dogana;
and then cutting off his Head, and carrying his trunk into the Piazzo, they left it there all
day as a spectacle for the people: he had only one Son by his Wife Annalena; which li|ving
not long after him, Annalena deprived both of Husband and Child, and resolving to
have no farther conversation with Man, she made a Monastery of her house, and shutting
her self up with several other Noble Persons, which came to her to that purpose; she spent
the remainder of her days there in great piety and devotion; calling the Monastery by her own
Name, and immortalizing her memory, both by the one and the other. This action was
no small diminution to Neri; and took away a considerable part of his reputation and friends
yet it did not satisfie the contrivers, for having been more than ten years at the helm, the
authority of the Balia expired, and every body began to talk and act with more freedom
than they thought convenient, they judged it necessary to revive that Court, for the encou|ragement
of their friends,1444. and the depression of their Enemies; Hereupon, in the Year
1444, the Counsels created a new Balia, which re-established the Offices; contracted
the number of the Officers which were to chuse the Senators;Florence refor|med. renewed the Chancery of refor|mation;
removing Philippo Peruzzi out of the Chancellorship, and putting one into his place
who they believed would be Governed by them. They prolonged the banishment of those
that were refractory; imprisoned Giovanni, the Son of Simone Vespucci; degraded the Ac|coppiatori as Enemies to the State, and with them the Sons of Piero Baroncelli; all the Serag|li,
Bartolomeo, Francesco Castellani, and several others; by which means they pro|cured
great reputation, and authority to themselves, and no little prejudice and disparage|ment
to their Enemies; and having settled themselves at home in the Government, they be|gan
to look about, and inquire how things were managed abroad.
Nicolo Piccinino (as we said before) being abandoned by Alfonso; and the Count, by
assistance of the Florentines, became formidably powerful, he assaulted Nicolo not far from
Fermo, and gave him so great a defeat, that Nicolo was glad to fly (almost alone) to Montec|chio,
where he fortified himself so well, and defended himself so bravely, that in a short
time his whole Army repaired to him again, and put him into a condition of supporting
easily against the Count, and the rather, because Winter being come, both of them were
constrained to send their Armies into quarters. All Winter long Nicolo was imployed in
encreasing his Army, which was much furthered by the assistance of the Pope, and Alfon|so;
insomuch that when the spring appeared, and both Armies took the field, the Count
was much too weak for Nicolo, and indeed brought to that extremity of want, that he
must of necessity have been ruined, had not the Duke frustrated the advantage which Ni|colo
had got over him. Philip sent to Nicolo to desire he would come presently to him, for
he must needs speak personally with him about business of very great importance; and Nicolo,
being greedy to know it, left his command to his Son Francesco, and went to Milan to the
Duke; relinquishing a certain victory, for an uncertain reward, which being perceived by
the Count he thought that occasion of engaging the Son in his Fathers absence, was not to
be slipped, and coming to a fight with him near the Castle di Monteloro, he overthrew Fran|cesco,
and took him Prisoner.
Nicolo arriving at Milan, finding himself deluded by the Duke, and understanding the
defeat,Nicolo dyes. 1445 and imprisonment of his Son, he took it to heart, and died with sorrow 1445 in
the 64 year of his age, a more brave, than a fortunate General. He left only two Sons,
Francesco, and Giacoppo, whose conduct was less, and fortune worse than their Fathers; so
that the Disciples of Bracio were almost extinct, whilst the Sforzeschan being more succes|ful,
became more glorious. The Pope understanding Nicolo was dead, and his Army o|verthrown
(not daring to rely much upon the King of Aragons supplies) desired a peace
of the Count, and obtained it by the meditation of the Florentines, by which the Pope was
to have in la Marca, Osimo, Fabriano, and Ricanato restored, and all the rest were to re|main
to the Count. After this accommodation in la Marca, all Italy had been quiet, had
not the Bolognesi disturbed it. there were two super-eminent families in Bologna, the Can|neschi,
and the Bentivogli; Hannibal was the head of the latter, and Battista of the first. To
beget the greater confidence betwixt them, many matches had been made; but among
Men that aspire to the same degree of greatness, an Allyance is sooner made, than a friend|ship.
Bologna was in League with the Venetians, and Florentines, which League was
made by Hannibal Bentivogli's means after Francesco Piccinino was expelled.Troubles in Bologna. Battista un|derstanding
how earnestly the Duke desired the friendship of that City, contrived how he

might kill Hannibal, and deliver that City to the Duke; and having concluded the circum|stances,
on the 24th of Iune 1445, Battista and his accomplices set upon Hannibal, and
slew him, and when they had done, declared themselves for the Duke. The Venetians and
Florentine commissaries were at the same time in the Town; and at the first report of the
tumult, returned privatly to their houses, but finding the people thronging in great num|bers
in the Market place, complaining, and exclaiming against the Murderers of Hannibal;
they took courage; joyned themselves with them, and putting them into a posture, they
fell upon the Canneschi, and in half an hours time, routed them, killed part of them, and
and drove the rest out of the City. Battista not having opportunity to get away, nor his Ene|mies
to kill him, betook himself to his house, where hiding himself in a chest, or Bing to
keep Corn in, they searched for him a whole day, and could not discover him: being assu|red
he was not gone out of Town, they came back again and threatened his Servants so, that
one of his Lacqueys betrayed him, and carried them to him; then drawing him out of his
hole in armour as he was, they killed him, and dragged him about the Sreets, and
burned him; so that the Victory of the Duke was sufficient to encourage that enterprize,
but his expedition in relieving it, was not great enough to make it good. By the death of
Battista, and the expulsion of the Canneschi their tumults were composed; but the Bolog|nesi
remained in no little confusion, there being none of the family of the Bentivoglio's left
to govern them; for Hannibal had only one Son, of about six years old called Giovanni;
and it was feared lest some difference and division might arise betwixt the friends of Benti|voglio
(in whose power it was to restore the Canneschi) to the destruction of their party, and
Country.
Whilst they were in this suspence, the Conte di Poppi being by accident in Bologna, sent
word to the principal of the City, that if they would be governed by one of Hannibals blood
he could direct them where they might have one; for about twenty years since, Hercules, a
Cousin-German of Hannibals being at Poppi, had the enjoyment of a young Maid in that
Town, who was brought to bed afterwards of a Son called Santi; which, Hercules affirm|ed
to him many times,Santi Benti|voglio. was his, nor was it to be denied, for who ever knew them both,
must needs ownea more than ordinary resemblance. The Citizens giving credit to what he
said, dispatched some of their Citizens to Florence immediately, to see the Youth and to de|sire
Neri, and Cosimo, that he might be delivered to them: the reputed father of Santi was
dead, and the Son lived with an Uncle called Antonioda Cascese, a rich Man, without
Children of his own, and a great friend of Neri's: Neri out of respect to his Uncle, think|ing
the business not to be despised, nor on the other side, rashly accepted, proposed that
Santi might be sent for; and that in the presence af Cosimo and the Bolognian Embassadors,
they might hear what he could say for himself; he was sent for accordingly, and behaved
himself so well, the Bolognesi were ready to worship him; so strangely prevalent sometimes
is the love of a faction; yet there was nothing concluded at this meeting, only Cosimo took
Santi aside and told him.
No Body can counsel you better in this case,Cosimo's speech to Santi than your self: because you may follow
your own inclination. If you be the Son of Hercules Bentivogli, you will apply your self
to such things as are worthy and sutable to the honor of that house But if you be the
Son of Agnolo da Cascese; you will continue in Florence, and spend the rest of your days
basely in the ordering of Wool.
This Speech netled the young Man, and whereas before he seemed to be irresolute, he
now declared he would refer himself wholly to Cosimo, and Neri, and do as they directed
him; and (it being agreed with the Embassadors) Clothes and Horses were bought, and
equipage provided, and a while after being honourably conducted to Bolonia, he was made
Governor both of Hannibals Son, and the City, which office he executed so well, that
whereas all his predecessors were killed by their Enemies; he lived quietly all his time and
died lamented at last.
After the death of Nicolo, and the peace concluded in La Marca; Philip wanting a new
General to command his Army made private overtures to Ciarpellone one of the most expe|rienced
officers in the Counts Army; and at last coming to an agreement, Ciarpellone desi|red
leave of the Count to go to Milan, and take possession of certain Castles which Philip
had given him in the late Wars. The Count suspecting the business (to disappoint the
Duke, and prevent his serving against him) he caused him first to be stopped, and after|wards
to be killed, pretending to have found him engaged in Conspiracy against him; at
which manner of proceeding the Duke was highly incensed, but the Venetians and the Flo|rentines
were pleased well enough, as apprehending the least amity betwixt the Count and
the Duke; however this indignity set all La Marca in an uproar, and was the occasion of
new War there. Gismondo Malatesti was Lord of Rimino; and being Son-in-Law to the

Count, he expected to have had the Government of Pesaro; but the Count having redu|ced
it, gave the Command of it to his Brother, which Gismondo took very ill; and to
make it the worse, his mortal Enemy Federico di Monte Feltro, by the Counts means, had
usurped the Dominion of Urbino: upon these provocations Gismondo joyned himself with
the Duke, and solicited the Pope and the King of Naples to make War upon the Count;
who to give his Son-in-Law a relish of the War to which he had such a mind, he resolved
to begin, and to fall first upon him; whereupon the Countries of Romagna and La Marca
were in a tumult immediately; for Philip, the King of Naples, and the Pope sent all of them
assistance to Gismondo, and the Venetians and Florentines (though they sent him no Men)
supplied the Count with what monies he wanted. Philip, not content to make War against
him in Romagna only, designed to deprive him of Cremona and Pontremoli, but Pontrmoli
was defended for him by the Florentines, and Cremona by the Venetians; so that the War
was received again in Lombardy;New war in Lombardy. and many troubles ensued in the Country of Cremona, a|mong
which the Dukes General Francesco Piccinino was overthrown at Casale by Miche|letto
and the Venetian Army; and the Venetians conceiving hopes thereupon of deposing the
Duke, sent their Commissary to Cremona, assaulted Ghiaradadda, and took all that Country,
except Cremona it self; and then passing the Adda, they made their excursions to the very
walls of Milan: the Duke not satisfied with his condition, applied himself to Alfonso King
of Aragon for succour; representing the ill consequences which would follow upon his Do|minions
in Naples, if Lombardy should fall into the hands of the Venetians: Alfonso promi|sed
to send him supplies, but their passage would be difficult without the permission of the
Count, upon which consideration, Duke Philip addressed himself to the Count, and begged
of him that he would not abandon the Father-in-Law who was both aged and blind. The
Count was much offended with the Duke, for having pulled those Wars upon him; and on
the other side the greatness of the Venetians did not please him at all; besides his mony was
gone, and the League supplied him but coldly; for the Florentines were now freed from
their apprehensions of the Duke,The Count courted by all Parties. which was the great cause of their caressing the Count, and
the Venetians desired his ruine, as the only person capable of carrying the whole state of
Lombardy from them.
Nevertheless, whilst Philip was seducing him to his side, and promised him the Com|mand
of all his forces, upon a condition he would leave the Venetians, and restore La Mar|ca
to the Pope; they sent Embassadors to him, promising him Milan, when it was taken,
and the Generalship of their Army in perpetuum, so he would prosecute the War in La Mar|ca,
and obstruct the supplies which were sending by Alfonso into Lombardy. The Veneti|an
proffers were great, and his obligations to them considerable, they having made that
War on purpose to secure Cremona to the Count; again the Dukes injuries were fresh, and
his promises not to be trusted. Yet the Count remained doubtful which he should accept; his
obligation to the League; his Faith given, the late good offices which they had done him,
and their many promises for the future, were great arguments on one side, yet he was loth
on the other side to deny the importunities of his Father-in-Law; but that which swayed
with him most of all, was the poison which he suspected was hid under the promises of the
Venetians, to whose discretion he must leave himself (if he succeeded in their Wars) both
for their performance, and his own preservation; which no wise Prince would ever do,
till necessity compelled him. But this suspence and difficulty of resolution in the Count,
was taken away by the Venetians; who having a design by some practices and intelligences
in the Town, to get it for themselves, upon some other pretence they caused their forces to
march into those parts, but their plot was discovered by him that governed there for the
Count, and in stead of gaining Cremona, they lost the Count, who laid aside all respects, and
joyned with the Duke.
Pope Eugenius was dead,Duke Philip died. 1447. Niolo V. created his successor, and the Count advanced with
his whole Army to Cotegnola in order to his passage in Lombardy, when news was brought
to him that Duke Philip was dead, which happened in the year 1447. on the last of August.
These tidings much troubled the Count, whose Army could not be in good order because
they had not had their full pay. The Venetians he feared, as being in arms, and his pro|fessed
Enemies, now upon his revolt to the Duke. Alfonso had been always his Enemy,
and he was fearful of him; he could have no confidence in either the Pope or the Floren|tines,
for the Florentines were in League with the Venetians, and he was in possession of se|veral
Towns which he had taken from the Pope: however he resolved to bear up bravely;
look his fortune in the face; and comport himself according to the accidents which should
occur: for many times secrets are discovered in action, which dejection and despondency
would have concealed for ever. It was no little support to him to believe, that if the Mi|lanesi
were oppressed; or that jealous of the ambition of the Venetian, no Man was so pro|per

for them to apply to, for protection, as himself. So that taking courage thereupon, he
marched into the Country of Bologna, and from thence passing by Modena and Reggio, he
encamped upon the Lenza, and sent to the Milanesi to offer them his service: the Milane|si,
after the Dukes death, were divided into factions; part of them had a mind to be free,
and part of them to live under a Prince; and of those which were for a Prince, part were for
the Count, and part for Alfonso: but they which were for a Commonwealth, being more
unanimous prevailed, and erected a republick according to their own model, to which ma|ny
of the Cities in that Dukedom refused to conform, supposing they might make them|selves
free as well as Milan if they pleased; and those who were not inclined to that Govern|ment,
would not submit to it in them. Lodi and Piacenza therefore surrendered to the Ve|netian;
Pavia and Parma made themselves free: upon which confusions the Count removed
to Cremona, where certain deputies of his to that purpose, met with certain Commissioners
from Milan,The Count made General for the Milanesi. and came to an agreement, by which it was agreed that he should be General
of their forces, and all conditions performed to him which were concluded in his last treaty
with the Duke; to which was superadded that Brescia should be put into the Counts hands,
till he should be posses'd of Verona. and that then keeping the last, the first should be re|stored.
Before the death of the Duke, Pope Nicolo upon his assumption to that Chair endeavou|red
to make a general peace, betwixt all the Princes of Italy; and to that purpose he ne|gotiated
with the Florentine Embassadors which were sent to his creation, for a Diet to be|held
at Ferrara, to treat either of a long cessation, or a firm peace; and accordingly the
Popes Legate was met there by Commissioners from the Venetians, the Duke, and the Flo|rentines.
Alfonso sent none, for he was at Tiboli with a great Army in favour of the Duke,
and believed (as soon as the Count could be debauched from them) he should have a fair
opportunity to fall upon both the Venetian, and Florentine. In the mean time the Count
lay still in Lombardy, attending the consummation of the Peace, to which Alfonso would
not send, but promised to ratifie what should be agreed by the Duke. This peace was a
long time in debate, but at length it was concluded, it should either be a cessation for five
years, or a perpetual Peace, as the Duke of Milan should chuse; the Dukes Commissioners,
returning to know his resolution, they found him dead, however the Milanesi were wil|ling
to stand to their agreement, but the Venetians would not condescend, fancying great
hopes to themselves of overrunning that State,The Venetians ambition of the Dutchy of Milan. because Lodi and Piacenza had submitted
to them soon after the death of the Duke; and believing either by treaty or force they
should be able to reduce the rest, before any Body could come in to their relief; and this
they fancied the rather, because the Florentines were engaged in a War with Alfonso. Al|fonso
was at this time at Tiboli, and being impatient to pursue his designs upon Tuscany (ac|cording
to agreement betwixt him and the Duke) conceiving the Waralready commenced
in Lombardy, would give him convenience, he had a great mind to have fome footing in the
state of Florence,Alfonso Invades the Florentines. before the War should apparently break out; to that purpose he entred
into correspondence with some persons in the Castle of Cennina, in the upper Vald' Arno,
and took it: the Florentines were much surprized at so unexpected an accident, and seeing
that King in motion against them, they listed Men, created a new Council of Ten, and
provided themselves for War, with as much industry as any of their predecessors. The
King was marched already with his Army into the Country of Siena, and had used his ut|most
endeavours to get that city into his clutches; but it continued firm to the Florentines;
refused to admit him, and all the rest of the Towns, under its jurisdiction, did the same. Yet
they furnished him with provisions, their weakness and the Kings great strength excu|sing
it.
The Kings resolution was changed of invading the Florentines by the way of the Val
d' Arno, either because Cennina was taken from him again, or that the Florentines were
too well furnished with Souldiers in those parts; wherefore he turned towards Volterra, and
surprized many Castles in the County belonging thereto. From thence he passed into the
County of Pisa, where, by the assistance of Arrigo, and Fatio (Counts of Gherardesca) he
took some posts, and then assaulted Campiglia, which being defended by the Florentines;
he was not able to carry; so that the King leaving Garisons in the places he had taken;
and certain Troops to make excursions upon the Enemy; with the rest of his Army retired
and took his quarters in the Country of Siena. The Florentines in the mean time being
secured by the season of the year, provided themselves with Souldiers with all possible care,
and gave the command of them to Federigo Lord of Urbino, and Gismondo Malatesta da Ri|mino,
betwixt whom there was some precedent difference, yet it was so prudently compo|sed
by Neri de Gino, and Barnardetto de Medici their Commissaries, that they took the field
together before the Winter was over; recovered the places lost in the Country of Pisa; and

the Pomerancie in the Volterran; curbing and restraining his excursions of those who were
left by Alfonso upon the Coasts, so, as they were scarceable to secure their Garisons. As
soon as the Spring was come, the Commissaries had a Rendevous of all their Army (which
consisted of about 5000 Horse, and 2000 Foot, at Spedalletto; and the King had another,
of about 15000, some three miles from Campiglia: and when it was supposed he would
have fallen upon that Town, he turned about to Piombino, believing it would be no hard
matter to gain it, in respect that it was but indifferently provided; and if he did, it would
be no little prejudice to the Florentines, seeing from thence he could harrass them with a te|dious
War, and by sending forces there by Sea, infest the whole Country of Pisa. This
Policy of Alfonso startled the Florentines, and consulting what was to be done, it was con|cluded,
that if they could lye with their Army upon the coasts of Campiglia, he would run a
hazard of being beaten, or be forced to draw off with no little disgrace. To this purpose
they rigg'd out four Galliasses which they had at Ligorn, and sent three thousand foot in
them to reinforce Piombino, and then posted themselves at Caldane a place of no easie access;
for to lie upon the coasts in the plain, they judged it more dangerous, and more subject to at|tacks:
the Florentines were to be supplied from the neighbouring Towns, which being
thin, and but ill inhabited, they were but indifferently furnished, so that the Army was
much incommoded, especially for Wine, for none growing there, and coming with great
difficulty from other parts, it was not possible to provide for them all. But the King
(though straitned by the Florentines) had plenty of all things by the way of the Sea. The
Florentines perceiving it, had a mind to try experiment, whether their forces could not be
supplied by Sea likewise, whereupon they caused their Galliasses to be brought, loaded them
with victuals, and having dispatched them accordingly, they were set upon by seven of
Alfonso's Gallies, and two of them taken, and the other two fled. This disaster cut off all
hopes of relieving that way: so that 200 of the looser sort of Souldiers ran away to the
Kings Camp for want of Wine, and the rest mutiny'd, grumling that they should be con|fin'd
to so hot places where there was no Wine, and the Water very bad: hereupon the
Commissaries took it into debate, and it was concluded that they should leave that Post,
and address themselves to the recovery of certain Castles which remained in the hands of
the King.
On the other side the King, though he wanted no provision, and was more numerous
in Men; found himself no less distressed, for his Army was full of the diseases which those
maritime Countries do produce, they were grown so general and fierce, that many Men
died, and most of them were sick. Upon this consideration, a Peace was proposed, and
the King insisted upon 50000 Florens, and that Piombino might be left to his discretion.
Which demands being deliberated at Florence, many who desired peace, were earnest to
have them accepted; affirming they could not expect success in a War, which required so
vast an expence to maintain it: but Neri Capponi going to Florence, gave them such pre|gnant
reasons to the contrary, that the whole City agreed to refuse them, and the Governor
of Piombino was well entertained, and promised to be relieved both in time of War and
Peace, if he would defend it couragiously as he had hitherto done. The King having no|tice
of their resolution, and perceiving his Army too sickly and infirm to take the place,
he brake abruptly from his siege; left above 2000 of his Men dead behind him; retreated
with the rest of his Army thorow the County of Siena,Alsonso retreats of Tuscany. and from thence into the King|dom
of Naples, highly dissatisfied with the Florentines, and threatning them with a new
War when occasion offered.
Whilst these things passed in Tuscany, the Count Francesco being made General for the
Milanesi, thought fit before any thing else, to reconcile himself with Francesco Piccinino,
(who had a command likewise under him) that he might assist him in his enterprises, or
at lest oppose them with more circumstances of respect: after which, he took the field with
his Army, and the Citizens of Pania, suspecting their own ability to defend themselves
against so formidable a force, and yet unwilling to bring themselves under the yoke of the
Milanesi, they offered to surrender to him, upon condition they might not fall under their
domination. The Count had a great mind to that City, and looked upon it as a fine ini|tiation,
and pretence, to the rest of his designs. Nor was it fear, or the imputation of
breaking his Faith, that restrained him from taking it, for great Men think it dishonorable
for to lose, but none to gain, though with fraud and injustice. His great doubt was, lest in
taking it, he should disoblige the Milanesi so, as they should give themselves to the Veneti|an;
and in not taking it, he was jealous they should surrender to the Duke of Savoy, to
which he saw too many of the Citizens inclin'd, in either of which cases, his authority in
Lombardy would be lost. At length judging it less danger to take that City himself, than
to let another Man get it; he resolved to accept it, persuading himself it would satisfie the

Milanesi, to let them know, how fatal it might have been for him to have refused it, see|ing
those Citizens would certainly have delivered it to the Venetian, or the Duke of Savoy;
either of which ways their State had been undone; and that it was better in his possession
who was their friend, than in either of theirs, both of them being too potent, and both of
them their Enemies. The Milanesi, for all his compliments, were much unsatisfied with
the business, as plainly discovering the ambition and ends of the Man; but they thought
best at present to conceal it, not knowing whither they were to betake themselves (upon a
rupture with the Count) but to the Venetians, whose pride, and arrogant terms, they
dreaded and abhorred: so that they concluded not to break with the Count, but to obviate
their present miseries, with his assistance, hoping when they were freed from the former,
some propitious opportunity might happen to quit them of him; for they were not only
infested by the Venetians; but by the Genoeses, and the Duke of Savoy in the name of
Charles of Orleans, descended from a Sister of Philips; but the Count defended all against
them without any trouble. Their greatest adversary was the Venetian, who was come
near with a powerful Army to seize upon their state, and had Lodi and Piacenza already in
their possession, which last, the Count beleagured, and after a long siege, took it, and
sack'd it: after he had recovered that City, Winter coming on, he drew his Army into
quarters, and went himself to Cremona, where all that Winter he entertained himself with
his Wife: but as soon as the Spring appeared, the Venetian, and Milanesi were both in the
field: the Milanesi had a great desire to retake Lodi, and afterwards to come to an agreement
with the Venetian: for the expence of the War was encreased; and the fidelity of the Count
suspected. In order to this, it was resolved their Army would march to Caravaggio and
besiege it; supposing that upon the taking of that Castle, Lodi would surrender. The
Count obeyed their Orders, though his own inclination was to have passed the Adda, and
invaded the Country of Brescia. Being set down before Caravaggio, he intrenched and
fortified his Army so well with Ditches and Ramparts, that the Venetians could not attempt
to relieve it without great disadvantage.
However the Venetians advanc'd with their Army, under the Command of their Gene|ral
Micheletto, within two flights shot of the Counts camp; continued there several days,
and had many skirmishes with them. Notwithstanding the Count persisted in his siege,
and prest them so hard, they must of necessity surrender. The Venetians, believing the
loss of that Castle would be the loss of their whole enterprize, were much dissatisfied with
the news, and calling a Counsel, after many disputes it was concluded, there was no way but
to attack the Count in his trenches, which was not to be done without great disadvantage;
but the Senate of Venice, though naturally timorous, and not apt to any sudden or dange|rous
resolutions, was in this case so much transported, as rather to venture all than lose that,
though the loss of that would be the ruine of all. It was concluded therefore to fall upon the
Count, and standing to their Arms one morning very early, they assaulted that part of the
camp which was the weakest guarded, and (as it usually happens in such surprizes as that)
at the very first onslaught, they put the whole Sforescan Army into disorder. But the Count
so rallied them again, that after many attempts, and irruptions upon their Works, they
were not only repulsed,The Venetians totally defeated. but so shattered and dispersed, that of their whole Army (in which
there were more tha 12000 Horse, there were not above 1000 escaped, and their whole
baggage and train of Artillery taken; so that never till that day had the Venetians received
so considerable a defeat.
Among the rest of the prey and Prisoners there was found a Venetian Proveditore who be|fore
the Battle had spoken opprobrious words of the Count, calling him Bastard and Co|ward:
this Proveditore finding himself in the hands of his Enemies, being conscious of his
offence; and expecting no otherwise, but that his reward would be sutable: according to
the Nature of base Spirits, (who are always insolent in prosperity, and poor and abject in
adversity) throwing himself with tears at the feet of the Count, he acknowledged his fault,
and beseech'd his pardon. The Count took him up by the arm, and bad him be of good
courage: but afterwards he told him, he could not but wonder a Person of prudence, and that
gravity as he desir'd to be thought, should commit so great an error, and indecorum, as to
speak reproachfully of those who did not deserve it. As to Bastardy he accused him of, he
knew not the passages betwixt Sforza his Father, and Madona Lucia his Mother, for not be|ing
then present, he was not able to order them better, and therefore he did hope nothing
which they did could be imputable to him. But this he knew, that since he had been ca|pable
of any thing himself, he had carried himself so, as no body could reprehend him, to
which, both he and his Senate could give fresh and irrefragable testimony; at last he admo|nish'd
him to be more modest for the future, to have more caution in all his enterprizes,
and then he dismiss'd him. After this Victory, the Count march'd his Army into the

Country of Brescia, possess'd himself of all wherever he came; and then encamped within
two miles of the City. The Venetians upon their overthrow, suspecting (as it happen|ed)
that Brescia would be the first thing the Count would attempt, reinforc'd it as much
as in so short a time they were able; got what forces they could together with all imaginable
diligence; and sent to the Florentines to desire their assistance by vertue of their League:
who being freed from their War with Alfonso, supplied them with a 1000 foot and 2000
Horse; with which forces having got an Army together, the Venetians began to think
they were in a condition to treat; and for a long time, it had been the custom and fate of the
Venetians to recover twice as much by peace, as they lost by the War. They understood
very well, the Milanesi were jealous of the Count; whose design was not so much to be
their General, as their Prince; they knew it was in their own power to make peace with
which of them they pleased; for both of them desired it; one out of ambition, the other
for fear. They concluded at last to compose with the Count, and to proffer him their as|sistance
for the subduction of Milan; presuming that the Milanesi finding themselves be|traid
by the Count, in their fury would submit to any dominion but his; and then they
being most capable of defending them, were the most likely to be the Persons they would
chuse for their protection.
Upon this resolution, they sent to try the Count, and found him very inclinable to a
peace, as desiring the victory at Caravaggio might be appropriated to him, and not to the
Milaneses. A peace therefore was struck up, and the Venetians obliged themselves to pay to
the Count, (till Milan should be taken) 13000 Florens a month and maintain in his ser|vice
4000 Horse,Peace betwixt the Venetians and the Count excluding the Milanesi. and 2000 Foot during the War. Th Count on the other side engaged to
restore to them, all the Towns, Prisoners, and what ever else had been taken in that War
by him; reserving to himself only such Towns as were in Duke Philips possession when he
died. The news of this agreement, disquieted the Milanesi much more than their Victory
had rejoyced them. The Magistrates storm'd; the People complain'd; the Women and
Children lamented; all of them in one chorus pronouncing the Count a Traitor and an in|fidel.
And though they did not expect to reclaim him from his ingratitude, by any pray|ers
or promises they could make him, nevertheless they thought fit to send Embassadors to
him, to see with what confidence, and expressions he could receive them after such barba|rous
disloyalty, and being brought into his presence, one of them spake to him to this
Effect.
Those who desire to obtain any thing of other People,The Oration of one of the Milan Embassadors to the Count. are wont to accost them with
prayers, or promises, or threats; that either their compassion, or profit, or poverty
might move them to condescend: but in Men that are cruel, and covetous, and prepos|sest
with their own greatness and authority; there being no room for either of the three,
'tis in vain for any Man to think to mitigate them with prayers, to oblige them with pro|mises,
or to fright them with threats. We therefore, understanding (though too late)
you cruelty, your ambition, and your insolence; are come hither, not to beg any thing
of you (for if we did, we are sensible it would not be granted) but to commemorate
and charge you with the benefits you have received from the People of Milan; and to re|monstrate
with what ingratitude you have requited them; that among the many miseries
which you have brought upon us, we may have at least the pleasure to reprehend you for
them. You ought to remember your condition after the death of the Duke; you were
at hostility with the Pope, and King Alfonso; you were discarded by the Venetians, and
the Florentines, who, upon some just and late provocation; or else finding you useless,
were become (as it were) your Enemies: you were tried and weary of the War you
had maintained against the Church, you were left without Men, without mony, without
friends, desperate of preserving your own, much more of gaining from others; under
which exigencies, of necessity you must have sunk, had not our innocence, and plain|heartedness
supported you. We, we were they who received you into our Arms, moved
by the reverence we retained for the memory of our Duke; with whom you had enter'd
into so near and so late an allyance; presuming (and as we thought) with reason, that
the love you profest to him, would have been extended to his People; and that our re|wards
being added to his, the amity betwixt us, would not only have been firm, but in|dissolvable,
and for that cause to your old articles with the Duke, we threw in Verona
and Brescia. What could we give, or promise you more? and you, what could you
have (or indeed ask) more of us, or any Body else at that time? You received from us a
kindness you could not look for; and we, in recompence, have received a mischief we
never deserved: nor was this the first instance of your falshood; for no sooner were you
in possession of the command of our Army, but against all justice and obligation, you received
Pavia into your hands; which, indeed, gave us the first hint of what was to be expected

from your friendship; however he swallowed that injury, in hopes such an acquest as that
might have satiated your ambition. But alas! those who must have all, will not be sa|tisfied
with a part. You promised that all your conquests afterwards should be ours, be|cause
you knew, what you should give us at several times, you could take from us at once;
this is verified since your victory at Caravaggio, which though won with the expence of
our treasure and blood, is by your baseness perverted to our ruine. Oh! unhappy are those
Cities who are constrained to defend their liberty against such as invade them, but much
more unhappy are they who in their defence are inforced to imploy such mercenary and
such treacherous instruments as you. May we be example to posterity, though Thebes
and the King of Macedon could be no warning to us, who having beaten their Enemies,
was made their General by them, and their Prince afterwards by himself. We are not, there|fore,
to be condemned for any thing, but our confidence in you; whose passed life, and in|satiable
appetite of dominion, ought to have taught us better than to have trusted a person
which betraid the Prince of Lucca; squeez'd the Florentines and the Venetians, disrespe|cted
the Duke, despised a King; and committed several injuries (above all) both a|gainst
God and the Church. And indeed we had no reason to believe that so many Prin|ces
and Potentates should be of less authority with Francesco Sforza, that the Milanesi, or
that he would be just in his engagements to us, when he had broke them with every body
else. But our indescretion cannot excuse your treachery, nor clear you of that infamy,
which our just and deplorable complaints will fix upon you all the World over. Nor
can any thing secure you against the stings and compunctions of your own Conscience; for
inverting those Arms which we had provided for our defence, against our own liberty
and freedom; you cannot think any thing so proper for you, as the reward of a Parricide.
And if yet your incontroulable ambition should blind you; the evidence the whole World
will give of your impiety, will open your eyes, and God himself will open them, if
either perjury, or falshood, or treason, do offend him; or if in his divine providence, for
some occult good, he sees it fit to forbear it, and to show himself to us a favourer of ill
Men. Do not therefore delude your self with the assurance of victory; the just anger of
God will oppose you; and we are resolved to lose lives and liberties together: and if it
so fall out that we should be constrained to submit, there is no Prince in Italy but we will
choose before you; and if our sins be so great, as to pull down the greatest misery in the
World upon our heads, and force us into your hands, be assured, that dominion which
you begin with infamy and fraud, will end in the destruction of you or your Chil|dren.
The Count was netled by every part of the speech, yet without any extraordinary
commotion in either gesture or words, he made them this answer;
That being injured so highly as they thought themselves,The Counts answer. he would bear with the in|discretion
of their language; though to persons capable of judging betwixt them, there
was nothing that they had charged him with, which he could not easily refel. He could
make it appear, that he had not injured the Milanesi, but secured himself only against their
intelligence and designs. That if they reflected upon their carriage after the Battle of Ca|ravaggio,
they would find, that in stead of rewarding him with Verona and Brescia, as they
had contracted, they were underhand negotiating a peace with the Venetians; that the
burden and scandal of the War might be left upon his shoulders, whilst they ran away
with the profits of it, and the honour of the peace: so that if they looked impartially into
the matter, they would find, he had done nothing but what they had endeavoured be|fore;
and that if he had defer'd to do it so long, the more they were oblig'd to him; and
with the more justice he might retort ingratitude upon them. That as to the truth, or
falsity of what was on either side alledg'd, the end of the War would make it appear, in
which, that God which they had so solemnly invocated to revenge them, would demon|strate
which of the two was most tender of displeasing him, and which with most equity
he opposed.
The Embassadors being departed, the Count prepared to invade them; and the Milanest
for their defence; to which purpose they joyned themselves with Francesco and Giacopo Pic|cinino,
who upon the score of the old animosity betwixt the Bracceschi and the Sforzeschi,
had been faithful to the Milaneses: hoping by their means to preserve their liberties, till
they should have opportunity to divide betwixt the Venetians and the Count, which amity
they did not think would be of any long continuance. The Count was of the same opinion,
and thought it his best way to bind them by rewards, seeing they were ticklish in their pro|mises.
In the distribution therefore of the War, he was contented the Venetians should attack
Cremona; whilst he with the remainder of the Army, assaulted the rest of that State: this
article being proposed to the Venetians was so grateful, that upon that very reason they con|tinued

their friendship to the Count, till he had overrun most of the Country of Milan; and
so straitned that City, that no provisions could come at it. So that despairing of other
relief, they sent Embassadors to Venice, to intreat, that they would commiserate their case,
and (according to the practice of all Commonwealths) rather support those who stood
for their liberty, than a Tyrant; who if he should gain their City, would be tooo strong af|terwards
for them. Nor ought they to believe he would be content with the terms of their
capitulation, who had violated his League with that state. The Venetians were not ye
Masters of Crema; and being loth to discover themselves till that were in their possession;
they answered them in publick, that their alliance with the Count would not suffer them to
assist them; but privatly they entertain'd them so, as they might give their Masters assured
hopes of their friendship. The Count was got already so near Milan, that he had taken
some part of the suburbs; and the Venetians having reduc'd Crema, they thought it time to
publish their amity with Milan, with whom they were secretly agreed; and the first ar|ticle
they agreed to, was the conservation of their liberty. This League being ratiied, the
Venetians commanded such forces as they had with the Count, to march back to their Army,
they signified likewise to the Count, the peace which they had concluded; and gave him
twenty days time to accept it himself. The Count was not at all surprised at the inconstan|cy
of the Venetians; he had foreseen it long before, and expected it should happen every
day. Yet he could not but regret it as much, as the Milanesi had been molested at his: he
desired two days to give in his answer to the Embassadors, which time he resolv'd to detain
the Venetians who were in his service, and go on with his enterprize. He gave out pub|lickly
he would accept of the peace; and sent Embassadors to Venice, with full power to
ratifie it; but they had private instructions to the contrary, to spin out and protract the
conclusion by all the cavils and subtleties they could invent: and that the Venetian might
give the more credit to his pretences, he made a truce with the Milanesi for a month; drew
of his Army, and dispers'd it into such places as he had taken in that Country: this strata|gem
of his was the occasion of his victory afterwards, and the ruine of the Milanesi; for the
Venetians presuming upon the peace, were slower and more remiss in their preparations for
War.
And the Milanesi, seeing the cessation confirmed; the Enemy removed, and the Venetian
their friend; believed for certain the Count would trouble them no more: which opinion
was pernicious to them two several ways, in making them more negligent for their de|fence;
and in sowing their land, which devour'd much of their corn, and was the reason
they were sooner distressed. On the other side, nothing was hurtful to them, but was be|neficial
to the Count, and gave him time to respite, and look abroad for allies. During
this War in Lombardy, the Florentines had not declar'd of either side: nor shown any fa|vour
to the Count when he took part with the Milanesi, nor afterwards; for the Count
having no great need of them, had not sought their assistance; only after the defeat at Ca|ravaggio,
(as they were oblig'd by the League) they sent aid to the Venetians. But now
the Count was alone, and had no body else to resort to, he was inforced to press their assi|stance,
publickly to the state,Cosimo de Me|dici a friend to Francesco. and privatly to his friends, but especially to Cosimo de Medi|ci,
who in all his undertakings had counsel'd him faithfully, and freely supplied him: nor
did he desert him now in his distress; but furnish'd him with what could privatly be con|vey'd,
encouraged him to go on in his design; he propos'd likewise that the City would
publickly own him; but he found difficulty, in that Neri the Son of Capponi was the most
potent Man in Florence, and to him it appeared more for the interest of that City, that the
Count should accept of the peace,Neri Cappon against him. than prosecute the War. His first apprehension was
least out of indignation to the Count, the Milanesi should give themselves up to the domini|on
of the Venetian, which would be the ruine of them all: then, if the Count should suc|ceed,
and Milan come into his hands, so great an Army, with so great a territory added to
it, must needs (in his judgment at least) become dangerous, and formidable; for if he were
troublesom whilst but a Count, when a Duke he would be insupportable. For these rea|sons
he affirmed it would be better for the republick of Florence, and for all Italy besides that
the Count should remain as he was, with his reputation in the Army; and Lombardy
be divided into two Commonwealths, which were never like to joyn to the ruine of their
Neighbours; and singly, and by themselves, they were not able to do hurt; to compass
which; he saw no way so probable, as by preserving their old amity with the Venetians, and
disclaiming the Count.
These arguments were not approved by Cosimo's friends; believing they were not so much
Neri's judgment, as jealousie; lest the Count being made a Duke, Cosimo should grow too
powerful by being his friend. Cosimo on the other hand persuaded that their alliance with
the Count would be for the advantage both of Florence, and all Italy; for it was madness to

imagine Milan could continue a Commonwealth, seeing the humour of the Citizens; their
manner of Life, and the old factions and differences among them, were not capable of any
form or system of civil Government; so that of necessity the Count must be Duke of it, or the
Venetians Lords: and in that case no body could be so weak, but to prefer a single Neigh|bour,
competently powerful; before an Enemy that was remote, but more great and in|controulable.
Neither could he believe the Milanesi would give themselves up to the Ve|netians,
for the Count had the bigger party in the Town, and when ever they found them|selves
unable to defend their liberties any longer; they would more probably surrender to
the Count than the Venetian. These varieties of opinions kept the City a long time in su|spence;
but at length it was agreed that Embassadors should be dispatch'd to the Count, to
treat about their alliance; if they found him so strong, that there was likelyhood he should
prevail, then they should conclude; but if otherwise, they were to cavil, and protract.
By the time these Embassadors had got to Reggio, they had news the Count was become
Master of Milan. For the Count as soon as his truce was expired, and had clapped down again
before it with his Army, hoping to carry it in a short time, in despight of the Venetians, for
they could not come to relieve it, but by the river Adda, which was easie to be hinder'd; be|ing
Winter, he could not fear they would remove him with their whole Army, and before
the Spring he doubted not to carry it, especially seeing Francesco Piccinino was dead, and
Giacopo his Brother remained sole Captain of their forces. The Venetian had sent an Em|bassador
to Milan to encourage them to defend themselves, and to assure them of speedy
and effectual relief; and so far they were as good as their words, that during the Win|ter
many skirmishes and conflicts passed betwixt the Venetians and the Count; till when
the weather began to be open, they came down with their Army (under the command of
Pandolfo Malatesta) and encamped upon the river of Adda; where it being debated in
Counsel whether they should fall upon the Count,The Veneti|ous assist the Milanesi. and run the hazard of a Battle, it was
opposed by Pandolfo, (upon his experience both of the Count and his army) who advis'd,
the Town might be relieved without any such danger, the Count being distressed already
both for forrage and Corn. Wherefore his opinion was, that they should block him up
where he was, and intercept his provisions, which would keep up the Spirits of the Mila|nesi
and divert them from surrendring to him.
This resolution was most plausible to the Venetians, because they thought it safe in it
self, and did hope by keeping the Town in constant necessity, it would be forc'd at last to
deliver up to them; for considering how the Count had provok'd them, they could not
imagine they would surrender to him. In the mean time the Milanesi were reduced to ex|tream
misery, for being a populous City, the poor People fell down dead in the Streets for
want of Bread; and this scarcity begetting murmurs and complaints in several places, the
Magistrats were afraid of some tumult or other, and us'd all possible diligence to prevent
their assembling. The multitude is not suddenly to be engaged in any mischief; but when
once they are dispos'd, the lest accident imaginable sets them on work. It happen'd that
two persons of indifferent condition being in discourse near the Porta Nuova about the ca|lamities
of the City, and what ways were left to preserve it; People got about them by de|grees,
so as in a short time they were in a considerable number; upon which a rumour was
spred in the Town, that they were in Arms against the Magistrats at Porta Nuova: here|upon,
the whole multitude (who expected some occasion) put themselves in Arms, made
Gasparre da Vico Mercato, their leader, and marching up to the place where the Magistrats
were in Council, they fell upon them with such fury, that all which could not escape, were
slain; among the rest Lionardo Veneto the Venetian Embassador, who had laugh'd at their
miseries, and was judg'd the principal occasion of their wants: having made themselves
Masters of the City, they deliberated which way to relieve themselves of their distresses,
and it was unanimously resolv'd (seeing their liberty was not to be preserved) that they
should throw themselves under the protection of some Prince which should be able to de|fend
them, but they were divided about the Person; some were for King Alfonso, some for
the Duke of Savoy, some the King of France, not one word all the while of the Count; so
great and implacable was the indignation of the People against him; yet at last, not agree|ing
in the rest, Gasparre da Vico Mercato mentioned the Count,Gasparre da Vico Mercato his advice. and display'd gravely before
them, that if their design was to rid themselves of the War, the Count was the only person
to be chosen; for the People of Milan were in necessity of a certain and present peace, not
of a tedious and only possible supply.
Then he fell with great words to mitigate the proceedings of the Count; he accus'd the
Venetians: he accus'd all the Princes of Italy, (who some for ambition, and some for ava|rice)
would not permit them to live free. And now since their liberty was lost; and they
must yield to some Body or other, his opinion was, they should do it to one that knew

them; and was able to defend them; that they might be sure of peace for their servitude,
and not be engaged in greater, and more pernicious War. The People heard him with
great intention, and when he had done, they cryed out with one voice that the Count should
be the Man;Francesco enter'd Milan, and made Duke of it. and Gasparre their Embassador to invite him; who carrying him the joyful
news, was kindly entertain'd, and the Count enter'd into Milan 26th of February 1450, and
was received with great acclamation, even by those Persons which not long before had so
highly traduced him.1450 The news of this conquest arriving at Florence, they despatched or|ders
immediatly to their Embassadors who were upon the way, that instead of treating an
agreement with him as Count (which was their instruction before) their business should
now be to congratulate him as Duke. These Embassadors were honorably entertain'd, and
bountifully presented by the Duke;The Duke of Milan and the Florentines Confederate. who knew, against the Power of the Venetians, he could
not have in all Italy more faithful nor more potent allies, than the Citizens of Florence, who
though freed from their apprehensions of the House of the Visconti, were nevertheless ob|noxious
to the forces of the King of Aragon, and the Venetians; for they knew the Kings
of Aragon would be their Enemies, for the amity and correspondence they had always main|tain'd
with the French; and the Venetians knew their old fears of the Visconti were occasi|oned
by them, and remembring with what eagerness the Visconti were persecuted, and that
if they came into their power, they were like to fare no better, they were bent wholly up|on
their ruine. For these reasons the new Duke embrac'd an agreement with the Floren|tines,
very willingly,The King of Aragon and the Venetian. and the Venetians, and the King of Aragon confederated against them;
the King of Aragon undertaking the Florentines, and the Venetians, the Duke; who be|ing
new, and scarce setled in his Government, they suppos'd would not be able to confront
them with all his own forces, nor all the friends he could make. But because the League
betwixt the Florentines and the Venetians, was not yet fully expir'd; and the King of A|ragon,
upon conclusion of the War at Piombino, had made an accord with them, it did not
seem convenient to break the peace abruptly, but rather to attend some accident that might
give them pretence to invade them. Whereupon they sent Embassadors to Florence (each of
them, apart) to let the Florentines know, that the Leagues which had passed betwixt
them were not made to offend any body,Embassadors from them to lorence. but to defend one another. Then the Venetians
complained that the Florentines had suffer'd Alexander the Dukes Brother to pass with his
forces into Lombardy by the way of Lunigiana: and besides had been the authors and
Counsellors of the agreement betwixt the Duke, and the Marquess of Mantoa; all which
they affirmed was done to the prejudice of their State, and contrary to the amity betwixt
them; insinuating as friends, that who ever injures another Person wrongfully, gives
him a right to revenge himself:The Floren|tines answer. and who ever breaks peace, must prepare for War. The
answer to these Embassies was committed to Cosimo, who in a wise and eloquent oration, re|capitulated
the benefits the republick of Venice had receiv'd from that State; declaring what
empire and dominion they had gain'd with that treasure, and forces, and advice of the Flo|rentines;
demonstrating that as the amity betwixt them was propos'd by the Floren|tines;
they would not be the first which would break it. For having been always lovers of
peace, they were well satisfied with their friendship; and would always endeavour to pre|serve
it. The truth was, all people wonder'd at their complaints  that so grave and judicious
a Senate, should concern themselves for things so trivial and vain; but seeing they thought
them worthy of their consideration, they could not but declare, that their Country was
free and open to any body; and that the Duke was a Person of such qualifications, that he
needed not the advice, or favour or any in the choice of his Allies; and therefore he was
afraid there was something more at the bottom, than they had hitherto discovered; which
if hereafter it should appear, the Florentines doubted not, but to manifest it easily to the
World, that as their friendship had been profitable, their enmity could be dangerous. How|ever
things were smoothed over pretty handsomly for that time; and the Embassadors
seemed to go away well enough content: yet the alliance the King of Aragon  the Venetians
had made, and the manner of their deportment, gave the Duke, and Florentines both,
more reason to prepare for a War, than to rely upon their peace: upon which the Floren|tines
confederating with the Duke the Venetians discover'd themselves, made a League
with Sienna, and banish'd all the Florentines, and their subjects, out of Venice and its do|minions:
and not long after, Alfonso did the same, without any respect to the League he
had made with them the year before; and without any just, or so much as pretended oc|casion.
The Venetians were desirous to get Bologna into their hands, and to that end fur|nishing
certain of their exiles with a proportionable force, they marched thither in the night
and by the common shore got into the Town so privatly, their entrance was not perceived,
till they gave the alarm themselves; upon which Santi Bentivogli, leaping out of his bed,
was inform'd the whole City was in the possession of the Enemy. Santi was advised by ma|ny

which were about him, to fly, and preserve himself that way, seeing there was not any
left to secure the State. However he resolv'd to try his fortune, and taking arms, and en|couraging
his servants to follow him, he went forth, and having joyn'd them to some of
his friends, he charg'd a party of the Enemy, beat them, kill'd several, ad forc'd all of
them out of the Town; by which action he was thought to have given ample testimony of
his extraction from the house of the Bentivogli. These passages made it clear to the Flo|rentines
that a War was intended; and therefore they betook themselves to their ancient
methods of defence. They created a Council of Ten. They entertain'd new officers.
They sent Embassadors to Rome, Naples, Venice, Sienna, and Milan, to desire aid of their
friends; to discover such as were suspicious: to gain such as were irresolute; and to prie
into the Counsels of their Enemies. From the Pope, they could obtain nothing but gene|ral
words, civility, and exhortations to peace. From the King of Aragon nothing but
idle excuss for having dismiss'd the Florentines;Preparations for War in Flo|rence. offering his passport to any which de|manded
it: and although he ende avoured by all means to conceal his preparation for War,
yet the Embassadors found him a juggler, and peceived several of his practices against their
State. With the Duke therefore they renewed their League; procured an amity with the
Genoeses; compos'd the differences about the reprisal, and many other things which had
formerly obstructed it: they tryed all ways to frustrate or break the Treaty; and they went
so far as to supplicate the great Turk, to banish all Florentines out of his Country; but that
Emperour would not hearken. The Florentine Embassadors were prohibited entrance
into the Dominions of the Venetian, because (forsooth) they were in League with the
King of Aragon, and could not send any Embssaes without his participation. The Siennesi
received their Embassadors, treated them well lest they should be overrun, before the
League could relieve them; and therefore they thought it best to collogue, and lull those
Arms a sleep, which they were not able to resist. It was conjectured then, that the Vene|tian
and King both, sent Embassadors to justifie the War; but the Venetian Embassador be|ing
refus'd likewise to be admitted into the territories of Florence, the King's denied to do
that office alone, and the whole Embassie came to nothing: by which the Venetians found
themselves us'd with the same rudeness and contempt, which not many months before they
had exercis'd upon the Florentines.
In the midst of these apprehensions, the Emperour Federigo 3. pass'd into Italy to be
crown'd,Federigo the Emperor en|ters into Flo|rence. and on the 30th of Ianuary 1451, enter'd into Florence with an equipage of 1400
Horse. He was honorably entertain'd there by the Senate; and continued with them to
the 6th of February, upon which day he departed for Rome, in order to his coronation; where
having performed that ceremony, and celebrated his nuptials with the Empress, (which was
come thither by Sea) he departed again for Germany; returned by Florence, (where all the
old honors were retreated) and having been oblig'd in his passage by the Marquess of Fer|rara,
he gave him a grant of Modena and Reggio as a reward. But the Florentines were not
by all those solemnities diverted from their preparations; for their own reputation, and
the terror of their Enemies, the Duke and they had enter'd into a League with France,
which with great joy, and ostentation they publish'd all over Italy.
In the month of May 1452 the Venetians, not thinking it fit to dissemble any longer, in|vaded
the territories of the Duke of Milan, by the way of Lodi with 16000 Horse, and 6000
Foot; whilst at the same time the Marquess of Monferrat (upon some designs of his own,
or the stimulation of the Venetians) assaulted him on the other side by the way of Alexan|dria.
The Duke had got an Army together of 18000 Horse, and 3000 Foot, with which
(after he had furnish'd Alexandria, and Lodi, with strong Garisons, and fortified all pla|ces
where the Enemy might offend him) he fell into the Country of Brescia, where he did
great mischief to the Venetians, both parties plundring the Countries, and burning such
Towns as were not able to defend themselves: but the Marquess of Monferrat, being defeat|ed
not long after by the Garison at Alexandria, the Duke was at more leisure to infest, and
make his inroads into the Countries of the Venetian. Whilst the War was carried on in
Lombardy in this manner, with various, but inconsiderable accidents, the Wars in Tuscany
was commenced betwixt the King of Aragon and the Florentines,Tuscany inva|ded by the King of Aragons for|es. and manag'd with as
little ardour, and success as the other. Ferrando (a natural Son of Alfonso's) march'd in|to
Tuscany with 12000 Men under the command of Federigo Lord of Urbin. His first
enterprize was to assault Faiano in Valdisciana (for the Siennesi being their friends, they
enter'd that way into the Florentine dominions) the Castle was weak; the walls but indif|ferent;
the Garison but small; yet those they had within it were valiant and faithful;
the whole number which were sent for the security of that place, not exceeding 200. Be|fore
this Castle Ferrando encamped, and either their courage was so little without, or theirs

so great within) that it took him up 36 days before he could master it. Which time gave
the Florentines great convenience of providing other places of higher importance, and draw|ing
their force together and disposing them into better order, than otherwise they could
have done.
This Castle being taken, the Enemy march'd into Chianti where they attempted two
little Towns which were held by a few private Citizens, and were repuls'd. Leaving
them, they remov'd to Castellina (a little Castle upon the confines of Chianti) and sate
down before it. This Castle was about ten miles from Sienna; weak in its works, but
weaker in its situation; yet in neither so weak, as the courage of the assailants; for after
44 days seige, and all the art, and force they could use, they were glad to draw off, and
leave the Castle as they found it. So little formidable were the Armies in those days, and
so inconsiderable the Wars, that those places which are now deserted as impossible to be
kept, were then defended as if they had been impossible to have been taken. Whilst Fer|rando
was with his Army in Chianti, he made many incursion into the Country of Florence,
running up with his parties within six miles of the Town, to the great terror and detri|ment
of their subjects, who, having got together about 8000 Souldiers, under the Com|mand
of Astorre de Faenza, and Gismondo Malatesta, held off from the Enemy towards the
Castle of Colle, being unwilling to come to a Battel, because they knew if they lost not their
Army, there was no danger of the War; for the little Castles which should be taken
would be restored upon the peace; and the great Towns were secure. the King had like|wise
a Fleet of about twenty Vessels (Gallies and Foists) in the Sea of Pisa, which Fleet
(whilst La Castellina was assaulted by Land) was imploy'd by the King to batter the Castle
of Vada that stood upon the Sea; and they did it so effectually, that in a short time by the
inadvertency of the Governor, they got it into their hands: from whence afterwards they
ran over the whole Country thereabouts, but those excursions were presently restrain'd
by certain Florentine Souldiers which were sent to Campiglia. The Pope in the mean time
concerned himself no farther, than to mediate an accord. But though he was so tender in
engaging abroad in any action of War, he found himself at home in no little danger. There
was at that time in Rome a person call'd Stephano Porcari,Stephana Porcari. a Citizen born, of good extra|ction,
and learning, but most eminent for the Generosity of his mind. This Stephano was
ambitious (as most are which are desirous of Glory) to perform, or at least attempt some
thing that might make him memorable to posterity. And nothing occur'd so honourably
to his thoughts, as to deliver his Country, from the insolence of the Prelats, and reduce it
to its primitive liberty; hoping if he effected it, he should be call'd either the Father or the
Restorer of his Country. His great hopes and encouragement in this enterpize was deduc'd
from the iniquity and ill lives of the Prelates; which were highly displeasing both to the Ba|rons
and People of Rome. But his greatest confidence was grounded upon certain verses
of Petrarch's in that Canto which begins, Spirito Gentile c. The verses are these.
Sopra ill monte Tarpeio Canzon vedrai.
Un Cavalier ch' Italia tutta honora,
Pensoso piu d' altrui che di se stesso.
Stephano was of opinion that Poets were many times inspir'd, and had perfect and divine
inflations from above. So that he concluded what Petrarch had prophesied in that Canto
would certainly come to pass, and he did not know any man fitter than himself to accom|plish
it, in respect of his eloquence and learning and favour, and friends. Having taken
up this fancy, he could not contain himself, but his words, gesture, and manner of living
discover'd him, and render'd him suspicious to the Pope; who to secure himself against his
plots, confin'd him to Bologna, and sent instructions to the Governor to have an eye over
him every day. But Stephano was not to be discouraged by one disaster; it rather animated
him in his design; in so much that with the greatest caution he could, he continued his pra|ctices
with his friends, and now and then would steal to Rome and back again with such
expedition, as he would be sure to present himself before the Governor at that time he was
to appear. But afterwards, having drawn in as many as he thought necessary for his work
he resolved to proceed to action, without farther delay; and sent to his correspondents in
Rome, that at a prefix'd time, a splendid supper should be prepar'd; all the conspirators to be
invited to it; and each of them have private orders to bring his Confident along with him,
and he promised to be there himself precisely at the time. All things were ordered exactly
to his directions; and he himself was punctually with them; for as soon as supper was rea|dy,
and serv'd up to the Table, he presented himself amongst them, in a Robe of cloth of
Gold, his collar and other ornaments about him; to give him Majesty and reputation (and

having embrac'd all the Conspirators) in a long oration he exhorted them to be couragious,
and dispose themselves chearfully in so glorious an enterprize. Then he appointed the way,
ordering one of them to seize the Popes Palace the next morning, and the other to run a|bout
the streets, and excite the People to Arm. But his Conspiracy coming to the ear of the
Pope (some say by the treachery of his confederats, others by his being seen in the Town)
which way soever it was,Stephano and his confederats put to Death. the Pope caus'd him and the greatest part of his Comerads to be
apprehended the very same night after supper, and put to death, as they deserved. This
was the end of that enterprize, and though among some People perhaps, his intention might
be commended, yet his judgment must necessarily be blam'd; for such attempts may
have some shadow of glory in the contrivance, but their execution is certain destru|ction.
The War in Tuscany had continued about a year, and in the spring 14531453. both Armies
had taken the field, when in relief of the Florentines Alexandro Sforza the Dukes Brother
arriv'd with a supply of 2000 Horse, by which the Florentine Army being much encreas'd,
and the Kings Army become inferior in number, the Florentines thought fit to recover
what they had lost, and with little labour took some of their Towns again: after which they
encamped at Foiano, which by the carlesness of the Commissaries was sack'd; so that the in|habitants
being dispers'd, they were hardly got to inhabite there again: and when they
did come, it was not without great exemptions and reward. The Castle of Vada also was
retaken; for the Enemy perceiving they could not hold it, they set it on fire, and depar|ted.
Whilst the Florentine Army was imploy'd in this manner, the King of Aragons Ar|my,
not having the courage to come near them, were retreated towards, Sienna, from whence
they made frequent excursions into the Country about Florence, where they made great
hububs; committed many outrages, and brought great terror upon the People, Nor was
the King defective in contriving other ways of assaulting his Enemies, dividing their forces
or detracting from their reputation. Gherardo Gambatorti was at that time Lord of Valdi|bagno.
This Gherardo and his Ancestors, had always been in the Florentine service, either
as hired, or recommended. Alfonso was tampering with this Gherardo to deliver up his
territory to him, and he promis'd to give him an equivalence in the Kingdom of Naples.
This transaction was not so private, but they had news of it in Florence, and an Embassa|dor
was dispatch'd to remember him of his own and his predecessors obligations to that
State; and to admonish him to presevere in his amity with them, as they had constantly done.
Gherardo pretended to be surpriz'd at what the Embassador told him; swore a thousand
oaths that never any such wickedness enter'd into his thoughts; proffer'd to have gone in
person to Florence, and resided there, to secure them of his fidelity; but being unhappily
indispos'd himself, his Son should go a long with him, and remain there as a perpetual Ho|stage.
His proffers, and his imprecations together made the Florentines believe that Ghe|rardo
was honest, and his accuser the Knave, in which opinion they acquiesced. But Ghe|rardo
went on with the King, and rather with more eagerness than before; and when all
was agreed, Alfonso sent Fryer Puccio (a Knight of Ierusalem) to take possession of the
Castles and Towns which belong'd to Gherardo.
But Bagno retaining its affection to Florence,The vale of Begno revolts. promis'd obedience to the Kings Commis|sary,
with no little regret: Puccio was in possession of almost all that State, only the Castle
of Corzano was behind, which was likewise to be deliver'd. When Gherardo made this sur|render,
among the rest of his own creatures about him there was one Antonio Gualandi,
a Pisan, a young Gentleman and brave, and one that highly detested this treachery in Ghe|rardo.
Pondering with himself the situation of the place, the number of the Garison;
the dissatisfaction he observed both in their gestures and looks, and finding Gherardo at the
Gate ready to introduce the Enemy; he convey'd himself betwixt the Castle and Gherardo
and taking his opportunity with both his hands thrust him away; and then causing the
wicket to be shut, he exhorted the guards to stand faithfully to the Florentines against so
false and so flagitious a Man: the report of this action arriving at Bagno, and the Towns
which were about it, they unanimously took Arms against their new Masters; and setting
up the Florentine colours upon the walls they drove them all out of that Country: this
news coming to Florence, they immediately clap'd their young Hostage into Prison, and
dispatch'd supplies to Bagno and those parts to secure them, and made that Country de|pendant
upon themselves. Gherardo (a Traitor in the mean time, both to his friends and
his Son) had much ado to escape; leaving his Wife, Family, and fortune in the hands of
his Enemies. This accident was lookt upon as a great deliverance in Florence: for had the
King made himself Master of those parts, he might with little expenso have overrun all as
far as Valdi Tevere, and Casentino, and brought such distraction upon their affairs, that the
Florentines must have divided their Army, and been disabled thereby from attending the

Aragonian forces about Sienna, with their Army entire. Besides the provisions which
the Florentines had made in Italy to oppose the confederacy of their Enemies; they sent
Agriolo Acciaivoli their Embassador into France, to negotiate with that King for the sending
King Rinato d' Angio into Italy, in the behalf of the Duke and themselves, and to represent to
him, that coming thither for the defence of his friends, when he was once entred, and had
settled them, he might set up his own claim to the Kingdom of Naples and they would be
engag'd to assist him, and so whilst in Lombardy and Tuscany the War was carried on (as
we have related) in France, the Treaty was concluded, and Rinato oblig'd in Iune to come
into Italy with 2400 Horse; and the League on the other side obliged at his arrival at Alex|andria,
to pay him 30000 Florens, and 10000 per men. afterwards whilst the War should
continue: but being ready (upon this stipulation) to pass into Italy, he was obstructed
by the Duke of Savoy and the Marquess of Monferrat, who were friends to the Venetians,
and would not suffer him to pass. Hereupon Rinato was desired by the Florentine Embassa|dor
to march with his Forces into Provence, and for the encouragement and reputation of
his friends, to pass himself and part of them into Italy by Sea, leaving the rest in Provence,
till the King of France should prevail with the duke of Savoy that they might march through
his Country: and as the Embassador advised, it was done; for Rinato went by Sea, and
the rest at the King of France's mediation, were permitted to pass into Italy through the
Dominions of the Duke of Savoy. King Rinato was received by the Duke of Milan with
all the demonstrations of Kindness imaginable; and having joyned their Forces, they as|saulted
the Venetians with such terror, that in a little time, all the Towns they had taken
about Cremona were recovered; and not contented with them, they took almost all the
Country of Brescia; for the Venetian Army, not thinking it self secure in the field, was
retreated under the very walls of that City. Winter coming on, and the Duke at Verona,
he thought fit, for the refreshment of his men, to put them into quarters, and consigned Pia|zenza
for the quarters of Rinato; where having remained all that Winter in the year 1453,1453.
without any action considerable; when the spring was come, and the Duke resolved to
draw into the field, and drive the Venetians out of all they had upon the terra firma, Ri|nato
signified to the Duke, that of necessity he must return into France. This resolution of
Rinato's was unexpected to the Duke, and gave him no little anxiety. He went to him
immediately, himself, and endeavoured with all possible importunity to dissuade him; but
neither prayers nor promises could prevail with him any farther, than to leave part of his
forces with them, and to engage himself to send his Son Giovanni, who in his room should
continue in the service of the League. How unwelcome so ever it was to the Duke, Rina|to's
departure was not at all displeasing to the Florentines for having recover'd what they
had lost themselves, and being grown fearless of Alfonso, they had no maw, that the Duke
should get more than his own Towns in Lombardy. Rinato continuing his resolution, de|parted
for France, and (as he had promis'd) sent his Son Giovanni into Italy; who staid
not in Lombardy, but remov'd presently to Florence, where he was honorably entertain'd.
This departure of Rinato dispos'd Duke Francesco to peace; the Venetians, the Florentines,
and Alfonso, were all weary of the War, and ready to embrace it; and the Pope desir'd it
above all, by reason that that very year Mahomet the great Turk had taken Constantinople
and made himself Master of all Greece: which alarm'd all Christendom, but especially the
Venetians and the Pope, who imagined already they felt his Talons in Italy. The Pope
therefore desired all the Potentates of Italy that they would send their several Plenipotentia|ries
to him, to negotiate a general peace. His motion being accepted and the Embassadors
met; when they came to the matter, so much difficulty arose, as there was but small hopes
of accommodation.
Alfonso required that the Florentines should reinburse him for all the charges he had
been at in the War: and the Florentines expected the same. The Venetians demanded
Cremona of the Duke; and the Duke Bergamo, Brescia, and Crema of them. So that these
difficulties seem'd impossible to be remov'd. Nevertheless, what was so desperate at Rome,
among so many, was easily concluded betwixt two of them, at Milan, and Venice; for
whilst the peace was negotiating at Rome, and proceeded thus slowly; on the ninth of A|pril
1454 it was determined betwixt the Duke and the Venetians, that each of them should
be restor'd to what they were possess'd of before the War.Peace betwix the Duke and Venetians. That the Duke should have li|berty
to recover what the Marquess of Monferrat, and the Duke of Savoy had taken from
him; and that three months time should be allow'd to the rest of the Princes of Italy to
come in. The Pope, the Florentines, the Siennesi, and other little Potentates came in within
the time prefix'd, and ratifi'd it; and the Venetians, Florentines and Duke, made a peace
betwixt them three for 25 years. Alfonso was the only Prince of Italy who seem'd to be re|fractory;

conceiving he could not concur without diminution, in respect he was to be ad|mitted
rather as an auxiliary, than a principal: upon which score he continued irresolute
a good while, and would not declare; at length upon several Embassies from the Pope and
other Princes, he suffered himself to be prevailed upon, and he and his Son entred into
the League for 30 years.Alfonso enters into the League. After which the King and the Duke made several alliances and
cross-matches together; marrying their Sons and Daughters reciprocally into one another
families. Yet, that Italy might not be left without feed or foundation for a new War, Alfon|so
would not enter into the League, till he had leave by consent of the colleagues to make
War upon the Genoeses; and Gismondo Malatesta; and Astorre Prince of Faenza: Peace
being concluded upon those terms, Ferrando Alfonso's Son, who had been at Sienna, re|turned
into Naples, having done nothing considerable in Tuscany, but lost many of his
Men.
This Peace being made, and most of the Princes comprehended, the only fear that re|mained,
was, lest the differences betwixt Alfonso and the Genoeses might disturb it. But
it prov'd otherwise, for Alfonso did nothing openly to molest it; it was the ambition and
avarice of the Mercenary Souldier which interrupted it; the Venetians (as their custom is
upon the conclusion of peace) disbanding their Army,New troubles by Giacopo Pic|cinino encou|rag'd privatly by Alfonso. Giacopo Piccinino one of their Ge|nerals,
with several other considerable officers (without leave) departed into Romagna,
and from thence to Sienna, where he began new Hostilities, and took several Towns. In
the beginning of these troubles, and of the year 1455 Pope Nicolo died, and Calisto 3. was
chosen to succeed. This Pope, to repress these new and approaching Wars, rais'd what
forces he could, under the command of his General Giovanni Ventimiglia, and joyning
them with the forces of the Florentines and the Duke (who were likewise got together to
suppress those commotions) they march'd together in a Body against Giacopo, and coming
to an engagement with him near Bolsena, notwithstanding Ventimiglia was taken prisoner Gi|acopo
was worsted, and got off in disorder to Castiglione della Pescaia; where, had he not
been supplied with money by Alfonso he had been utterly ruin'd. Which relief made all
People believe that that enterprize was undertaken, and prosecuted by Alfonso's order, and
direction: and Alfonso perceiving he was discover'd, to reconcile himself to the Colleagues,
(whom he had disoblig'd with that pitiful War) he brought it about that Giacopo should
restore all he had taken in the territory of Sienna, upon the payment of 20000 Florens;
after which conclusion, he receiv'd Giacopo and his forces into the Kingdom of Naples. In
these times, though the Pope was very intent upon the curbing of Piccinino, yet not so but he
had eye still upon the interest of Christendom, which was then much overlaid by the Turk.
To this end he sent Embassadors, and preachers into all the Provinces of Europe, to per|suade
them to arm against the common Enemy of their Religion;Calisto 3. so|licits War a|gainst the Turks. and with their persons
and purses to give what assistance they were able: so that in Florence great store of alms were
collected; and several People wore the red corss, to intimate that they were ready in their
Persons to engage in that War. Besides which, several solemn processions were made; nor
was there any thing in publick or private wanting, to show them among the forwardest of
the Christians in that enterprize, either for Counsel, or Money, or Men. but the edge of
this Croisad was taken off, by a late intelligence they receiv'd, that the Turk having be|sieg'd
Belgrade a Town in Hungary, not far from the Danube; was beaten off by the Hun|garians,
and himself wounded: so that the terrour which all Christendom conceiv'd upon
the taking of Constantinople, being abated, they went on but cooly in their preparations
for War; and in Hungary likewise upon the Death of the way-wod their General, their Vi|ctory
was prosecuted but faintly. But to return to the affairs in Italy. The troubles com|menced
by Giacopo Piccinino, being compos'd in the year 1456, and all humane contenti|on
in appearance at an end; it pleased God to begin a new War of his own, and to send such
a storm and tempest of Wind in Tuscany, as produc'd most strange and memorable ef|fects,
above the records of time past,A prodigi|ous tempest. or the credit of time to come. Upon the 24 of Au|gust,
about an hour before day near the upper Sea towards Anconia, a thick dark cloud, of
about two miles wide, was seen crossing over Italy, and pointing towards Pisa; which
cloud being driven by an extraordinary impulse (whether natural or supernatural I cannot
say) was divided into several parts; sometimes hurried up to the sky; sometimes as furi|ously
towards the Earth; sometimes twisting round like a Cylinder, knocking and dashing
one against the other with unconceivable violence, with great lightnings and flashes of fire
before them; which concussions made a noise more dreadful and loud than ever any thun|der or
Earthquake was known to have done. The terror of this tempest was so great, eve|ry
one believed the World was at an end; and that the Heavens, the Earth, the Waters, and
the rest of the Elements, were resolving into their first chaos and confusion: nor were the
effects less formidable where it pass'd, especially about the Castle of S. Casiana. This Castle

is about eight miles from Florence, situate upon the mountain which parts the vales of Pisa
and Grieve; betwixt this Castle, and the Town of S. Andrea (upon the same mountain)
this whirlwind passing, reach'd not to the Town; and of the Castle it carried away only
the battlements and chimnies; but betwixt the said places it laid several houses flat with the
ground; tore up the Churches from their foundations, and carried the Roofs of the Chur|ches
of San. Martino a Bagnuolo, and of Santa Maria della pace, whole and entire, above the
distance of a mile. A Messenger and his mules were hurried out of the way, into the
neighbouring valley, and found dead the next day. The sturdiest Oaks and the strongest
trees, were not only blown down, but carried an incredible distance from the place where
they grew. Insomuch that when day appeared, and the tempest was over, the people re|mained
stupid, and in strange consternation. The Country was desolate, and wasted;
The ruines of the houses and Churches terrible; The lamentation of those whose houses
were subverted and their cattel, servants, or friends found dead in their ruines, was not
to be seen nor heard without great horror and compassion. But God sure intended rather
to affright, than chastise the Tuscans; for had this tempest happened in any of their Cities
where the houses were thick, and the inhabitants numerous, as it fell upon the hills
where the oaks and trees and houses were thin; doubtless the mischief and desolation had
been greater than the mind of man can comprehend. But God Almighty was pleased to
content himself with this essay, to make mankind more sensible of his power, if they per|sisted
to offend him.
But to return where I left. Alfonso, as I said before, was not at all satisfied with the
peace; and seeing the War which he had caused Giacopo Piccinino to make, upon the Sien|nesi
(without any reasonable occasion) had produced no considerable effect; he had a mind
to try what that would come to, which by the League he was permitted to undertake: So
that in the year 1456. (desiring to fix that Government in the family of the Adorni, and to
supplant the Tregosi who were then in possession) resolved to invade the Genoes both by
Sea and by Land.The Genoesi assaulted by Alfonso To this end, he caused Giacopo Piccinino to pass Tronto with his Forces and
fall upon Gismondo Malatesta, (by way of diversion) who having secured his Towns was not
much terrified at his reproach, so that his enterprize on that side turn'd to little account but his
invasion of Genoa created him and his Kingdom more troubles, than he ever desir'd: Piero
Fregosa was at that time Duke of Genoa. This Piero, finding himself unable to bear up against
so powerful a King: upon consideration of his own weakness, resolv'd at lest to surrender
that State to one that should be able to defend it, and perhaps sometime or other give him a
reasonable reward; he sent Embassadors therefore to Charles 7 of France to desire his pro|tection,
and tender him the Government. Charles accepted the offer, and to take posses|sion
of the City,Genoa deli|vered to the French. he sent Giovanni d' Angio (King Rinato's Son) who not long before was
returned from Florence into France; for Charles was persuaded that Giovanni being ac|quainted
with the humors, and customs of the Italians, was properer for that Government,
than any Man he could send: besides from thence he believ'd he might prosecute his de|signs
against Naples with more ease and covenience; his Father Rinato, having been ex|pel'd
that Kingdom by Alfonso of Aragon. Hereupon Giovanni departed for Genoa, was
receiv'd honorably by the Town, and invested with the whole power both of the City, and
State.
This accident was not at all pleasing to Alfonso; he found now he had pull'd an old
house over his head; however he carried it bravely, went on with his enterprize and was
advanc'd with his Fleet under Villa Marina at Porto Fino, when surpriz'd with a sudden
distemper, he died.Alfenso dies. The death of Alfonso, put an end to the Wars against Giovanni, and the
Genoeses: and Ferrando succeeded his Father Alfonso in the Kingdom, was in no little
trouble, having an Enemy upon his hands of such reputation in Italy; and a jealousie of
several of his Barons, who being inclin'd to new changes, he was afraid might side with
the French: besides he was acquainted with the ambition of the Pope, and being scarce set|led
in his Kingdom, was fearful lest he should attempt something to supplant him: his on|ly
hopes were in the Duke of Milan, who was no less solicitous for the affairs of that King|dom,
than himself; apprehending that if ever the French came to be Masters of Naples, their
next enterprize of course would be against him; for he knew they might pretend to Milan as
an appendix to that Crown. For these reasons, as soon as Alfonso was dead, Francesco
sent letters and Men to Ferrando; the first to keep up his heart, the other his reputation.
Upon the death of Alfonso the Pope designed to give his Nephew Piero Lodovico Borgia, the
Government of that Kingdom; and to gloss over the business, and make it more plausible
to the Princes of Italy, he gave out that that Kingdom belonging formerly to the Church,
his intention was only to reduce it to that condition, and therefore he desired the Duke of
Milan would not give any assistance to Ferrando; and offer'd him such Towns as he had

possess'd formerly in that Kingdom. But in the midst of his contrivances Calisto died, and
Pius 2.Calisto 3. dies and Pius 2. chosen in his chair. succeeded him, who was a Sinnesi of the Family of the Piccol Huomini, and his
Name Aeneas.
This Pope imploying his thoughts wholly for the benefit of Christendom, and the Honour
of the Church, and laying aside all private passion, and advantage at the intreaty of the Duke
of Milan, crown'd Ferrando King of Naples: judging it a readier and safer way to compose
the differences of Italy by confirming him that was already in possession, than by assisting the
pretences of the French; or setting up (as Calisto did) for himself. However Ferrando
took it for a favour, and to requite it he made Antonio the Popes Nephew Prince of Malfi;
married him to his natural Daughter; and besides this, restor'd Benevento and Ferracina to
the Church. And now all the Arms in Italy were visibly laid down, and Pius (as Calisto
had begun before) was moving all Christendom against the Turk; when a new quarrel
sprung up betwixt the Fregosi, and Giovanni the Lord of Genoa, which produc'd a greater,
and more important War than the last:The Genoesi revolts from the French. Petrino Fregosi was retir'd to a Castle of his in Rive|ria;
much discontented, that Giovanni d' Angio having been prefer'd to his dignity in Genoa
by him and his Family, had not gratified them as they deserved: so that by degrees it was
come to a feud. Ferrando was very well pleas'd with the difference; as being the only
way to secure him in his Kingdom, and therefore he sent Pietrino supplies both of men and
mony, hoping thereby Giovanni might be expuls'd out of the State of Genoa. Giovanni
having notice of their intelligence sent for relief into France, which having received, he
march'd out against Pietrino; but Pietrino by the access of more supplies from sundry places,
being grown too strong, Giovanni retreated, and applyed himself to securing the City;
which he did not do so carefully, but Pietrino in one night surprized several Posts in it, but
was beaten the next morning, himself, and most of his Men slain. this victory elevated Gio|vanni
so far, that he resolv'd to attempt upon Ferrando; departing from Genoa in Octo|ber
1459 with a great Fleet,1459. he sail'd to Baia, and from thence to Sessa, where he was ho|norably
received by that Duke.
There had joyn'd themselves with Giovanni,The King|dom of Naples invaded by Gi|ovanni d' An|gio. the Prince of Taranto, and the Citizens of
Aquila; besides several other Princes and Cities; so that already that Kingdom was more
than half lost. Upon which Ferrando desir'd aid of the Pope, and the Duke of Milan, and to
lessen the number of his Enemies, made peace with Gismondo Malatesti, which peace disgusted
Giacopo Piccinino so highly (Gismondo being his natural Enemy) that he deserted Ferran|do,
and took up Arms under Giovanni. Ferrando sent mony likewise to Federigo Lord of
Urbin, and as soon as could be expected, got together a considerable Army (according to
those times) with which he march'd against the Enemy, and finding them upon the
River Sarni, he engaged them, but was defeated and his most considerable officers taken;
after this victory, most of the Towns and Castles surrendred to Giovanni only Naples  some
few neighbouring Towns and Princes, adher'd still to Ferrando. Giacopo Piccinino advis'd
to march directly for Naples,Ferrando dis|comfited. and make himself Master of the chief City, but Giovanni re|plyed
he would first ruine the Country, and then the City would come with more ease; but
his rejecting the Counsel of Piccinino, was the loss of that design; for he did not know that
the members follow the head more naturally, than the head the members: Ferrando was
fled into Naples, and there resorted to him diverse of his Subjects who were driven from
their homes, whom he receiv'd, and having with all possible gentleness, gained some mo|nies
of the Citizens, he got a small body of an Army together; he sent new Embassies to
the Pope and Duke for supplies and was reliev'd with more plenty and speed than before;
for they were both of them afraid, that the loss of that Kingdom would turn to their preju|dice.
Much strengthened by their supplies, Ferrando march'd out of Naples; and having
recover'd his reputation, in part, he recover'd some of his Towns: But whilst the War
was carried on in that Kingdom with such variety, an accident happen'd which rob'd Gio|vanni
of his opportunity of compleating that enterprize. The Genoesi were extreamly dis|satified
with the insolent Government of the French; had taken Arms against the Gover|nor,
and forc'd him into the Castle; in this action the Fregosi and Adorni concur'd; and
the Duke of Milan, supplyed them both with mony and men: King Rinato passed that way
with a fleet towards the relief of his Son, imagining by the help of the Castle he might recover
the Town; and landing his men in order thereunto, he was beaten in such sort, that he was
forc'd back into Provence. This news dismaid Giovanni not a little: however he gave not his
enterprize over, but continued the War by the help of such Barons whose revolt from Fer|rando
had render'd them desperate of pardon: at length after many occurencies, both Armies
came to a Battle near Troia, in which Giovanni was routed, but his defeat troubled him not
so much, as the loss of Piccinino, who left his side, and went back again to Ferrando. His

Army being broke, he got off into Histria and from thence into France. This War conti|nued
4 years,Giovannis defeated. and miscarried by the negligence of the General, when the Souldiers had
many times overcome. In this War however the Florentines were not publickly concern'd.
The truth is upon the death of Alfonso, his Son Iohn of Aragon being come to that Crown,
sent his Embassadors to desire their assistance for his Nephew Ferrando, according to their
obligation by their late League with Alfonso; but the Florentines returned, that they did
not think themselves oblig'd to assist the Son in a quarrel commenced by the Father; and as
it was begun without their consent or knowledg, so without any assistance from them it
might be continued or ended. Whereupon, in behalf of their King, the Embassadors pro|tested
them guilty of the breach of the League, and responsible for all the losses which
should follow; and having done that, in a great huff they departed. During the revo|lutions
in this War, the Florentines were at quiet abroad, but at home it was otherwise, as
shall be shown more particularly, in the following Book.


THE
HISTORY
OF
FLORENCE.
BOOK VII.
IN the reading of the last Book, it may appear (possibly) impertinent, and a digres|sion,
for a Writer of the Florentine History to have broke out, and expatiated upon
the affairs of Lombardy and Naples. Yet I have done it, and shall do it for the fu|ture;
for though I never profess'd to write the transactions of Italy, yet I never
bound my self up from giving a relation of such important and memorable passages, as
would make our History more grateful and intelligible; especially seeing from the actions
of other Princes and States, wars and troubles did many times arise in which the Floren|tines
were of necessity involved: for example, the War betwixt Giovanni d' Angio, and
King Ferrando, proclaimed in them so great a hatred and animosity one towards
the other, that it was continued afterwards betwixt Ferrando and the Florentines, and
more particularly the House of Medici. For King Ferrando complaining, not only that
they had refus'd him their assistance, but given it to his Enemies; that resentment of his,
was the occasion of much mischief, as will be shown in our narration.
And because in my description of our Foreign affairs, I am advanc'd to the year
1463. (being return'd to our domestick) it will be necessary to look back for se|veral
years. But first by way of introduction (as my custom) I shall say, that they
who imagine a Commonwealth may be continued united, are egregiously mistaken. True
it is, dissention does many times hurt; but sometimes it advantages a State. It hurts when
it is accompanied with parties, and factions; it helps, when it has none. Seeing there|fore,

it is impossible for any Legislator or founder of a republick, to provide there should be
no piques, nor unkindnesses betwixt Men; it is his business what he can, to secure them a|gainst
growing into parties and Clans. It is then to be consider'd, that there are two ways
for Citizens to advance themselves to reputation among their Neighbours, and they are, ei|ther
publickly or privatly. The Publick way is, by gaining some battle, surprizing and
distressing some Town; performing some Embassy carefully and prudently; or counselling
their State wisely and with success; the private way is, by being kind to their fellow Citi|zens;
by defending them from the Magistrats; supplying them with mony, promoting
them to honors; and with plays and publick exhibitions to ingratiate with the People. This
last way produces parties and factions, and as the reputation acquir'd that way is dangerous
and fatal, so the other way it is beneficial (if it sides with no party) as extending to the
publick. And although among Citizens of such qualification, there must needs be emula|tions
and jealousies, yet wanting partisans, and People which for their advantage will fol|low
them, they are rather a convenience than otherwise, to a Government; for to make
themselves more eminent and conspicuous than their Competitors, they imploy all their fa|culties
for its advancement, prying and observing one anothers actions so strictly, that nei|ther
dares venture to transgress.
The emulations in Florence were always with faction; and for that reason always were
dangerous; nor was any party unanimous any longer than it had an adverse party in being;
for that being overcome, and the predominant party having no fear, nor order to restrain
it, subdivided on course: Cosimo de Medici's party prevail'd in the year 1434; but (the
depress'd party being great, and many powerful Men amongst them) for a while they con|tinued
unanimous and supportable, committing no exorbitance among themselves, nor
injustice to the People, which might beget them their hatred. Insomuch, as when ever
they had use of the People for their readvancement to any place of authority, they found
them always ready to confer it upon the chief of that party, whether it was the Balia or any
other power which they desir'd: and so from the year 1434 to 55 (which was 21 years)
they were six times created of the Balia by the Counsels of the People.
There were in Florence (as we have many times hinted) two principal Citizens, Cosi|mo
de Medici, and Neri Capponi.Cosimo de Medici and Ne|ri Capponi the two great Ci|tizens in Flo|rence. Neri had gain'd his reputation in the publick way, and
had many friends, but few partisans: Cosimo on the other side had advanc'd himself both
ways, and had friends and partisans both, and these two continuing friends, whilst they
lived together, they could ask nothing of the People; but it was readily granted, because
unanimity went along with the Power. But Neri dying in the year 1455, and the ad|verse
party being extinct, the Government found great difficulty to recover its authority,
and Cosimo's great friends were the cause of it, who were willing to detract from his autho|rity,
now his adversaries were suppress'd. This was the beginning of the divisions in 1466,
in which year, in a solemn counsel, where the publick administration was debated, those to
whom the Government at that time belonged, advised that there should be no Balia for the
future: that the way of imborsation should be laid aside; and the Magistrats be chosen by
lots, as in the former Squittini's or elections. To obviate this humour, Cosimo had two
ways, either to possess himself forcibly of the Government by the power of his party, and
depose his Enemies: or to let things go which way they would, and attend till time should
make his friends discern, that they did not take the Government, and authority so much
from him, as from themselves. Of the two he made choice of the last; knowing that ac|cording
to that constitution, the purses being full of his friends, he could without any dan|ger
reassume his Authority when he pleas'd. The City being thus reduc'd to its old way of
creation of Magistrats by lots, they thought they had perfectly recover'd their liberty, and
that for the future elections were to be made not according to the influence of the Nobility,
but the inclination of the People. So that sometimes the friend of one Grandee was reje|cted,
and sometimes of another, and those whose houses were formerly full of Clients and
their presents, had now scarce housholdstuff left, or servant to attend them: those who
were formerly their inferiors, were now become their equals, and their equals advanced to
be their Superiours: they were not regarded nor respected, but rather derided and abus'd;
all People taking the freedom to talk of them and their Government as they pleas'd, even
in the streets and high ways, without any contradiction; so that it was not long after, they
discovered, that as he had told them, it was not so much Cosimo, as themselves which were
degraded.
However Cosimo took no notice, but in all propositions that would please the People, he
was the first who concurr'd. But that which was most terrible to the Nobility, and made
Cosimo look about him, was the receiving of the Catastro of the year 1427 by which the im|positions
were to be laid by order of Law, and not by the capriccio's of particular Men.

This Law being reviv'd, and Magistrats already chosen to put in execution, the Nobility
assembled, and went to Cosimo to beg of him that he would be a means to rescue them out of
the jaws of the people; and restore the State to a condition that might make him power|ful,
and them honorable. To which Cosimo replyed he would do it with all his heart, pro|vided
it might be done legally by the consent of the people and without any force, of which
he would not endure to hear. Then they endeavoured in the Counsels to prevail for a new
Balia, but they could not obtain it; whereupon they returned to Cosimo, and press'd him
with all expressions of humility that he would consent to a Parliament; but Cosimo (re|solved
to make them fully sensible of their error) absolutely refused it, and because Donati
Cochi (being Gonfaloniere di Giustitia at that time) presum'd to call a Parliament without
his consent; Cosimo made him so ridiculous and contemptible in the Senate, he was not able
to continue there but as a distracted Man, was sent home again to his house: Neverthe|less,
lest things should run too far to be recovered, Luca Pitti (a bold and tenacious Man)
being made Gonfaloniere di Giustitia, e thought it a convenient time to have the Govern|ment
to him, that if any thing miscarried in that enterprize it might be imputed to Luca.
And accordingly Luca in the very beginning of his office, urged the People many times to the
restauration of the Balia, threatning those of the Counsels with opprobrious and insolent
language; and not long after he executed what he had threatned; for in August 1453 in
the vigil of San. Lownzo,Luca Pitti. having filled the Palace with armed Men, he called the people
together in the Piazza, and constrained them by force to consent, to what they had vo|luntarily
refused. Having repossess'd themselves of the state, created a new Balia, and chang|ed
the Magistrats according to the pleasure of a few; that the biginning of their Government
might be as terrible, as it was forcible, they confin'd Girolamo Machiavelli and some others,Girolamo Machiavelli.
and deprived many of their honors. Girolamo not being exact in observing his bounds,
was proscrib'd, and wandring up and down Italy to excite the several Princes against his
own Country, by the Treachery of one of the Senators in Lunigiana, he was apprehended,
brought back to Florence, and executed in Prison. This Government (which lasted eight
years) was very violent, and insupportable: for Cosimo being grown old, weary of busi|ness,
and infirm in his body; could not be so sedulous as formerly, so that the City was
become a prey to a few particular Citizens; who in requital of his good service to the State,
made Luca Pitti a Knight, and he (in return of their kindness) appointed, that whereas
before they were called Priori dell Arti, now (that they might at least retain the Title,
though they lost the possession) they should be be called Priori della liberta. He ordered
likewise that whereas formerly the Gonfalonieri sat on the right hand of the Retori, they
should sit in the midst of them hereafter: and (that God might have his share in the revo|lution)
he caused solemn services, and processions to be performed, by way of thanks for
the honors to which they were restored.
Luca was richly presented both by Cosimo and the Senate; after whom the whole City
came in flocks, so that it was beleived he had given him that day to the value of 20000 Ducats
by which means he grew into such reputation, that not Cosimo, but he was looked upon as
the Governor of City; and he arrived at that point of vanity, to begin two stately and
magnificent houses one in Florence,  the other at Rucina, not above a miles distance from the
City: but that in Florence was greater, and more splendid, than the House of any other pri|vate
Citizen whatsoever; for the finishing of which he baulk'd no extraordinary way; for
not only the Citizens and better sort, presented him, and furnish'd him with what was ne|cessary
about it; but the Common people gave him all of them their assistance: besides all that
were banish'd, or guilty of Murder, Felony, or any other thing which expos'd them to pub|lick
punishment, had Sanctuary at that house provided they would give him their labour.
The rest of his Brethren, though they built not such houses, they were no less rapacious
than he, so that though Florence had no Wars abroad to destroy it, it had Citizens at home,
in its own bowels, which would not suffer it to prosper. In the mean time, as we have
said before, the Wars happen'd in the Kingdom of Naples, and the Pope had difference with
the Malatesti in Romagna concerning Rimino and Cesana, which they had taken from
him, and desired to recover: so that betwixt the thoughts of that, and the enterprize
against the Turks, the time of Pius his whole Papacy was consum'd. But Florence fell again
into its old factions and dissentions. The divisions in Cosimo's party began in 55 upon the
occasions aforesaid, and by his wisdom (as is said before) they were restrained. But in
64 Cosimo fell sick,Cosimo dies. and dyed, generally lamented, both by his friends and his Enemies, for
they, who lov'd him not whilst at the Helm, seeing their fellow Citizens so rapacious
whilst he was living, (the reverence they bore to his Person making them less insupportable
than otherwise they would be) could not but fear, now he was dead, and his influence lost;
they should be utterly ruined, and in his Son Piero they could repose little confidence; for

though he was of himself a good Man, yet being infirm, and but young in the State, they
supposed he would be constrained to comply with them, and they become more head-strong
and incontrolable in their wickedness: so that Cosimo died universally lamented, and cer|tainly
he deserved it for he was the most famous and memorable Citizen (of a Person that
was no Souldier) that ever Florence or any other City produc'd: he exceeded all his con|temporaries,
not only in Authority and Estate, but in liberality and prudence; which
qualities made him a Prince in his Country, and beloved by all People: his munificence
was more eminent after his death, than before, for when his Son Piero came to look over
his writing, and to enquire into the particulars of his Estate, he found there was scarce a
Man of any quality in the City, to whom Cosimo had not lent a considerable sum; and ma|ny
times when he heard of the exigencies of any Person of quality, he supply'd them unask|ed.
His magnificence appear'd in the multitude of his buildings; for in Florence he built
the Convents of S. Marco, and S. Lorenzo, and the Monastery of S. Verdiano: in the Monti
di Fiesoli, S. Giralomo, and the Abbey in Mugello, he not only repaired a Church of the Mi|nor's,
but he took it down, and rebuilt it from the ground: besides this in S. Croce, in Servi in
Agnoli, in S. Mineato, he erected altars, and most sumptuous Chappels, all which besides
the building, he adorn'd with all the utensels and decorations required in so sacred a place.
Besides his religious houses, he built several private houses for himself, one in the City su|table
to his quality; four without, at Careggio, Fiesole, Cafaggivolo, and Trebi, all of
them fitter for Princes, than private Men: and as if his buildings in Italy were too few to
make him famous, he built an Hospital in Ierusalem, for the reception and relief of poor
and infirm pilgrims brought thither by their devotion; in which fabrick, he laid out a vast
sum of Money: and albeit in his actions and buildings he behaved himself like a King, and
was the only Prince in Florence, yet he was so moderate, and untransported in all things,
that in his conversation, his Parades, his allyances, and his whole manner of life, he re|tained
the modesty of a Citizen; for he was sensible that ostentation and Pomp in that
which is every day to be seen, contracts more envy, than moderation, and gravity. Being to
seek for matches for his Sons, he did not endeavour for the alliance of Princes, but married
his Son Giovanni to Cornelia Alessandri, and Piero, to Lucretia Tornabuoni, and contracted
his Grand-children by Piero, Bianca to Gulielmo di Pazzi, and Nannina to Bernardo Rucel|lai.
Among all the States, Princes, and civil Governments of his time; no person came
near him for sagacity and intelligence. Hence it was that in all the variety of his fortunes,
when the City was so uncertain, and the people so voluble; He kept his Authority 31 years,
for being a wise man and of great prospect, he foresaw any mischief at a distance, and was
ready to prevent it, before it proceeded too far; or to frustrate the effects of it, if it did
Whereby he did not only subdue all domestick and private ambition at home, but restrained.
it so happily in several Princes, that whoever confederated with him and his Country, came
off upon equal terms, if not worsted their enemies; and whoever oppos'd him, either lost
their money, their time, or their State: and of this the Venetians can give ample testimony,
who whilst in League with him against Duke Philip, were always victorious; but that
League was no sooner broken, but they were beaten both by Philip, and Francesco: and
when they joyned with Alfonso against the Republick of Florence, Cosimo with his own credit
drained Naples and Venice so dry, that they were glad to except what terms of peace he
would allow. Of all the difficulties therefore which Cosimo encountred both within the
City and without, the conclusion was still honorable for him, and destructive for his ene|mies;
so that the civil discords gain'd him authority at home, and his foreign Wars, pow|er
and reputation abroad; insomuch that to the territory and Dominion of his Country, he
added the City of Borgo a Sepulcro, Montedoglio, Casentino, and Valdi Bagno, and by his
virtue and fortune, snppress'd his Enemies, and exalted his friends. He was born 1389.
on S. Cosimo, and Damiano's day. The first part of his life was full of troubles, witness his
banishment, his imprisonment, and his dangers in being killed. From the Counsel of
Constance, after Pope Iohn was ruin'd (whom he had attended thither) he was forced to
fly in disguise, or otherwise he had been slain: but after the fortieth year of his age it was
more pleasant and happy; not only such as were employ'd with him in publick affairs, but
the managers also of his private treasure in foreign parts, participating of his felicity. From
him many Families in Florence may derive their great estates: particularly the Fornabuoni,
the Benci, the Portinari, the Sapetti, and in short all that had dependance either upon his
counsel or fortune.
Though his disbursements were vast in building his Houses and Temples, and in his distri|butions
to the poor, yet he would complain sometimes among his friends, that he had not laid
out so much to the honour of God, as he was oblig'd; and that if he had done much more, he
must confess himself his debtor. His stature was ordinary, his complexion worthy, his

presence venerable: his learning was not great, but his eloquence admirable; he was na|turally
prudent, courteous to his friends, merciful to the poor, profitable in his converse,
cautious in his counsels; speedy in his executions, and in his sayings and replies, both so|lid
and facetious. When he went first into Banishment, Rinaldo de gli Albizi) drolling
upon his exilement) sent him word, The hen was hatching, to which Cosimo returned, that she
would have but ill hatching so far from her nest. To some of his Rebels who in a threatning
way sent him word. They were not asleep, he reply'd, he believ'd it, for he had spoil'd their
sleeping. When Pope Pius was encouraging and pressing all Christian Princes against the
Turk, Cosimo said the Pope was an old Man, but he had begun an enterprize as if he had been
a Boy. To the Venetian Embassadors, who came to Florence with the Embassadors of Al|fonso,
to complain of that Commonwealth, putting his hat off to them, he demanded the co|lour
of his hair, they told him it was gray; he replyed, in time your Senators will be of the
same colour. Not many hours before his death, his Wife seing him shut his eyes, enquired why
he did so, and he told her to use them. Some Citizens after his return complaining to him that
the City would be depopulated, and God Almighty offended, if he banished so many weal|thy
and Religious Men; he told them, the City had better be depopulated than destroyed.
That two yards of Cloth were enough to keep a Man from the cold; and that States were not
to be preserved by the beads a Man carried in his hand. These last expressions gave his Ene|mies
occasion to calumniate him, as a person that was a greater lover of himself than his
Country; and one that took more care of this World than the next. Many other of his wise
sayings might be inserted, but being unnecessary, they are omitted. Cosimo was likewise a
great lover and advancer of learned Men; upon which score he entertained in Florence
Argiropolo a Grecian, as learned as any in his time, that by him the youth of Florence might
be instructed in the Greek tongue, and in several of his Tenets. He entertained likewise in
his House Marcileo Ficino, a great Patron of the Platonick Philosophy, whom he loved so
entirely; and that he might follow his studies with more convenience, he gave him a house
near his own Palace at Caraggi. So that his prudence, his beneficence, his success, and his
way of living made him be belov'd, and feared among the Citizens, and much esteemed by
all Princes of Europe. Whereby he left such a foundation to his posterity, that by their
virtue they might equal him, by their fortune transcend him, and obtain as much honor as
he had in Florence, in all the Cities and Countries of Christendom. Nevertheless towards
the latter end of his days, he had several afflictions, he had but two Sons, Piero and Gio|vanni,
of which Giovanni (the most hopeful) dyed, and Piero who survived, was infirm,
and by the weakness of his body unfit either for publick or private business; so that after
the death of his Son, causing himself to be carried about his house, he sighed and said, this
house is too big for so small a Family.
It troubled him also that he had not (in his judgment) enlarged the dominion of the
Florentine state, nor added to it empire, any considerable acquest: and its troubled him
the more, for that he found himself cheated by Francesco, who when he was but Count, had
promis'd him, as soon as he had made himself Master of Milan, to employ his Arms against
Lucca in the behalf of the Florentines; but his mind chang'd with his fortune, and having
got to be the Duke of Milan, had a desire to enjoy in peace, what he had obtained by War,
so that after his elevation, he never medled in foreign concerns, nor made any more Wars,
than were necessary for his own defence: which was a great disturbance to Cosimo, who now
discerned he had been at great pains and expence to advance a Man who was both false and
ingrateful. He perceived likewise that in respect of his age, and the infirmities of his body,
he was not able to apply himself to publick or private business as he was wont; and he saw
both the one and the other decline, the City going to wrack by the dissentions of the Citi|zens;
and his fortune by his Ministers and Sons. These considerations gave him no little
disquiet towards his end; yet he died full of Glory and renown; all the Cities and Princes
of Christendom sent their compliments of condolency to his Son Piero, the whole City at|tended
his Corps with great solemnity to the Grave, and by publick decree it was inscrib'd
upon his Tomb Padre della Patria.
If in my description and character of Cosimo, I have rather followed the example of those
who have written the lives of Princes, than of an Historian, it is not to be admir'd. He was
a person extraordinary in our City, and I thought my self obliged to give him a more than
ordinary commendation: during the time that Italy and Florence were in the condition a|foresaid;
Lewis King of France was infested with a furious War, which his Barons (at
the instigation of Francis Duke of Britan, and Charles Duke of Burgundy) had rais'd. This
War lay so heavy upon him, he could not assist Giovanni in his designs upon Genoa and Na|ples,
but believing he had need enough of all the supplies he could get, he call'd back his
forces; and Savona being at that time in the hands of the French, he ordered it to be deli|vered

to the Count, and left him if he pleas'd to pursue the enterprize against Genoa: the
Count was easily persuaded to a thing so much to his advantage; so that by the reputation
of his amity with the French King, and the assistance given him by the Adorni, he possess'd
himself of Genoa, and in gratitude to the French King, sent him a supply of 1500 Horse in|to
France, under the Command of his eldest Son Galeazzo: by this means Ferrando of A|ragon,
and Francesco Sforza remain'd at quiet; the one Duke of Lombardy, and Lord of
Genoa; the other King of the whole Kingdom of Naples, and having contracted alliances
together, and married their Children the one to the other; they began to consider how
they might secure their states to themselves whilst they lived, and to their heirs when they
were dead.
In order to this, it was thought necessary, the King should make sure of such of his Ba|rons
as had sided against him in his Wars with Giovanni d' Angio, and the Duke should en|deavour
to extirpate all that had been favourers of the Bracci, who were mortal Enemies to
the said Duke, and at that time in great reputation, under the conduct of Giacopo Piccinino.
For Giacopo being the greatest Captain in Italy, and having no Soveraignty of his own; it
concerned all who had any, to have an eye over him, and more especially the Duke, who
thought he could not enjoy his Dominion safely himself, nor leave it to his Sons, whilst Gi|acopo
was living. Hereupon the King with all industry endeavoured an accord with his Ba|rons,
used all possible art to reconcile himself to them; and he succeeded with much diffi|culty;
for they found that whilst they were in Wars with the King, they must certainly be
ruined; but by accommodation of their differences, and trusting themselves to him, there was
only a hazard; and because Men do always avoid those evils with more readiness, which are
most certain, Princes do easily deceive, such as are not able to contend. The Barons seeing
nothing before them but destruction, if they continued the War, accepted his conditions,
and threw themselves into his Arms; but not long after, sundry pretences were taken against
them, and they were all of them extinguished. Which news, was so terrible to Giacopo
Piccinino (who was then with his forces at Solmona) that by the mediation of his friends
he immediatly practised his reconciliation with the Duke: and the Duke having offered
him honorable terms, Giacopo resolv'd to accept them, and come in; and accordingly he
went to Milan to present himself to him, attended by 100 Horse. Giacopo had served un|der
his Father, and with his Brother a long time; first for Duke Philip and then for the
People of Milan; so that by long conversation in those parts he had got a good interest, and
was generally belov'd, and the present condition of affairs, had much increas'd it; for the
prosperity, and Grandeur of the Sforzeschi had created them envy; and Giacopo's adversity
and long absence had gain'd him compassion among the People, and a great desire to see
him advanced: all which kindness discovered it self at his arrival; there being scarce any of
the Nobility but went out to meet him; the streets were full of People to behold him; and
no talk in the whole City but of him, and his family. But their extravagant acclamations
were his ruine; for as they increas'd the Dukes jealousie, so they confirm'd his resolution to
remove him, and that it might be done the more plausibly, and with less danger of dete|ction,
he ordered that his marriage with Drusiano his natural daughter (to whom he had
been contracted long before) should be consummate. After which he practis'd with Fer|rando
to entertain him as General of his Army, and to give him 100000 Florens by way of
advance; upon conclusion of these Articles, Giacopo and his wife accompanied an Ambassa|dor
from the Duke to Naples: where they were all very well received, and for several
days entertained with all imaginable affluence and diversion; but desiring leave to pass to
his Army at Solmona, he was invited by the King into the Castle, and after supper both he
and his Son Francesco were apprehended, and clapped up into Prison, where not long after
they were murdered.
Thus were the Princes of Italy jealous of that virtue,Giacopo Pic|cinino murder|ed. which they had not in themselves;
and not enduring it in other People, they exposed that Country to calamities which not
long after afflicted and destroyed it.
Pope Pius, having in the mean time accommodated the differences in Romagna, and find|ing
an universal peace all over Europe; thought it a convenient time to solicite the Christi|ans
against the Turks, and reassumed the whole methods which his predecessors had taken,
by which all the Princes of Christendom were prevailed withal to assist either with mony,
or Men: Matheo King of Hungary, and Charles Duke of Burgundy engaged to go in Person;
 were made Generals of that enterprize by the Pope, who was so well pleas'd with what he
had done, that he went from Rome to Ancona to be at the Rendezvous of the Army, which
was to meet there, and (by Ships which the Venetians had promis'd to furnish) be trans|ported
into Sclavonia. After the arrival of his Holiness, there was so great a throng and
confluence of People, that in a few days all their provision was devoured; and the neigh|bouring

Towns not being able to supply, every Body was ready to starve for hunger: be|sides
which they neither had mony to pay the Souldier, nor weapons to Arm them; there
was neither Duke of Burgundy, nor King of Hungary there; the Venetians indeed had sent
a few Gallies under one of their Captains, but it was rather to show their Pomp, than to
perform their promise; so far were they unfit for the transportation of an Army. So that
in the midst of these disasters by reason of his great age and infirmities, the Pope died; the
whole A disbanded and returned to their own homes. Pope Pius dying in the year
1465,  (by birth a Venetian) was elected in his place. And as most of the Principali|ties
in Italy had changed their Governors about that time,Francesco Sforza died. so Francesco Sforza Duke of Mi|lan
died after he had enjoyed that Dukedom sixteen years, and Galeazzo his Son was declared
his successor. The Death of this Prince was the occasion that the divisions in Florence encrea|sed,
 broke out much sooner than otherwise they would have done. Cosimo being dead, Piero
his Son succeeded both to his authority and Estate; and having call'd to him Diotisalvi Neroni
as honorable and great a Man as most in the City, (by whom, Cosimo upon his death bed had
commanded his Son Piero to be governed in all his affairs) he let him know the great confi|dence
his Father had repos'd in him, and that being desirous to obey him after his Death, as he
had done whilst he was living, he did intreat his advice not only in his private and domestick
affairs, but in his publick administration of the Government:  that he might begin first with
his own particular business, he would show him the accounts and Books of his Estate, that he
might understand how things stood; and direct him afterwards as he pleas'd. Diotisalvi pro|mised
to be ready, and faithful; but the accounts being produced and examined, were found
very disorderly and imperfect: Diotisalvi (as a Person which respected his own interest,
more than his professions to Piero, or his obligations to his Father, supposing it easie to rob
him of his reputation, and divest him of the Authority which Cosimo had left him as heredi|tary)
came to him therefore with Counsel very fair and reasonable in appearance, but in|wardly
destructive and pernitious. He represented to him the disorder of his accounts; and
what sums of mony would be necessary to have by him, if he meant to keep up his credit,
or preserve his preferment in the State: he told him that those disorders were not any way
so readily to be redress'd; nor his Coffers so naturally supplied, as by calling in such sums as
were owing to his Father both abroad and at home. For Cosimo (to gain himself an inte|rest)
had been very ready to accommodate any body that wanted; and the monies he had
lent amounted to an incredible sum. Piero was well satisfied with his advice, and thinking
it but just, he called in his mony. But no sooner had he done it, but the Citizens cryed
out upon him; declaimed against him as ingrateful and covetous, and used him as opprobri|ously,
as if he had robbed them, and not demanded his own. Diotisalvi finding his de|sign
succeed, and that Piero was fallen into disgrace with the People, he consulted with
Luca Pitti, Agnolo Acciaivoli, and Nicolo Soderini, how they might depose him: they were
all of them ready to embrace the design; but upon several grounds and provocations; Luca
desired to succeed Piero in his command, for he was grown so great, he disdained to obey
him: Diotisalvi, knew Luca was not fit to be chief in the Government, and therefore he
thought, if Piero was removed; in a short time that authority would devolve upon him:
Nicolo Sodoreni had a mind the City should be more free, and governed by direction of the
chief Magistrats: Agnolo, had a private quarrel to the Medici for several reasons, and parti|cularly
these. Raffaello his Son had long before married Alessandra de Bardi, and had a great
fortune with her: this Lady, either for his own defects, or other Peoples, was ill treated by both
Father-in-Law, and Husband. Lorenzo d' Ilarione a young Gentleman her relation,
pitying her condition, went with certain of his Comerads one night well Armed, and took
her by force out of the house of Agnolo. The Acciaivoili complained heavily of the out|rage,
and the cause being refer'd to Cosimo, he awarded that the Acciaivoili should refound
her portion, and that then it should be left to the Ladies election whether she would return
to her Husband or no. Agnolo did not think Cosimo in this determination, had dealt with
him as a friend, and not being able to revenge it upon him, he resolv'd to do it upon his
Son. Yet though their reasons and ends were diverse, the Conspirators agreed all in their
pretence, that the City should not be governed by a peculiar Council, but by the Magistrats.
The hatred of the People, and their occasions to revile him, were much exaggerated by
the failing of several Merchants about that time, which was objected to Piero as a great pre|judice
to the City, as if the calling in of his mony had broke them. To this aspersion it
was added that he was negotiating a match for his eldest Son Lorenzo, with Clarice a
Daughter of the Orsini, which they took in great dudgeon, and upbraided him by it, decla|ring
that it was now apparent what he drove at; and that thinking his Son too good for
any alliance in Florence, it was manifest he did not now look upon himself as a Citizen, but
was casting about how he might make himself Soveraign: for he was too proud to have the
Citizens to his kindred, had a desire to make them his subjects; and therefore he did not

deserve to have them his friends. These Conspirators believed they had all sure in their
hands, for the greater part of the Citizens being deluded with the name of liberty, (with
which the Conspirators had guilded and embellished their designs) had profess'd themselves
on their side. There being a general ebullition of these sort of humors at that time in the
City; it was thought convenient by some that were not at all taken with them, seeing
they could not be absolutely depress'd, to find out a way to discuss and divert them; for
whilst the People are idle, they are proper instruments for any commotion: to employ them
therefore, and remove their thoughts from contriving against the Government (it being
a compleat year since Cosimo died) for the entertainment and recreation of the City, they
took occasion to make two publick and solemn Feasts, or shows (which are usual there)
one of them represented the three Wise men, who were conducted by the Star to the place
where our Saviour was born, and this was performed with so much Pomp and magnificence
that for several months together the whole City was employed about the Pageants and pre|paration.
The other was called a Tornament (which is a kind of skirmishing on Horse|back)
in which the young Gentlemen of the City had challenged the most eminent Knights
of Italy; and among these young Gentlemen, Lorenzo the eldest Son of Piero carried the
applause, not by favour or partiality, but by his own valour and dexterity. But these sports
and divertisements were no sooner over, but the Citizens returned to their old jealousies, and
every one pursued his own fancy with more eagerness than before; which occasioned great
feuds, and they were augmented much by two unfortunate accidents. The one was, that
the authority of the Balia was expired; the other that Francesco Duke of Milan was dead;
upon whose death, the new Duke Galeazzo, sent Embassadors to Florence to confirm the
capitulations which his Father Francesco had made with that City; one of the articles obli|ging
them to pay Francesco an annual sum of mony: the chief of the adverse party think|ing
this a fair opportunity, opposed the Medici in the ratification; alledging that the agree|ment
was made with Francesco, not with his Son; and that Francesco being dead, the obli|gation
was void; for Galeazzo was not so great and considerable as his Father, and there|fore
his amity unlikely to be so profitable; so that though indeed there was not much gain'd
by Francesco, there was less to be expected from his Son; and if any Citizen, to maintain
his own private interest would pay him his annuity, it would be against the freedom and the
safety of the City.
To this Piero replyed, that so important an alliance, was not so carelesly to be lost, that
nothing was more advantagious and necessary (as well for all Italy as Florence) than their
alliance with the Duke; for thereby the Venetians would be discouraged from attempting
upon that Dutchy, either by counterfeit friendship, or manifest War. But should this alli|ance
be dissolv'd, no sooner would it be known to the Venetians, but they would fall im|mediately
upon the Duke; and finding him young, without friends, and scarce warm in
the State; they would easily carry it from him, either by fallacy or force; and in either of
those cases, the Commonwealth of Florence must be destroyed. But his reasons could not
be accepted; the sedition began to break out openly: the adverse party assembled in seve|ral
Companies in the night, the greatest part of them in La Pista, and the friends of the
Medici in the Crocetta: the Conspirators being impatient to have Piero destroyed, had got|ten
the subscription of several Citizens as favourers of their designs: but being got together,
one night above the rest, after solemn debate in Counsel which way they were to proceed;
it was unanimously agreed that the power of the Medici should be rebated; but they were
divided in the way; the most moderate part proposed that seeing the Balia was extinct, they
should only take care it should not be revived; for if the Government fell into the hands of
the Counsels and Magistrats (as it would do of course) in small time Piero's authority would
evaporate; and with that, his interest among the Merchants; for his affairs were now in
such a posture, that unless he could relieve himself by the publick Treasure, he would be
certainly ruined: and when that should happen, there would be no farther danger of him,
their liberty would be recovered without banishment or blood, which all good Citizens
ought to desire; but if force was applyed, infinite hazards might occur. If one be falling
of himself, no body thrusts him; if any one thrusts him, every body sustains him. Besides,
if nothing extraordinary being acted against him, he will have no occasion to Arm, or
strengthen his party; and if he should, it must be with great charge, and disadvantage; for
every one would suspect him, which would facilitate and hasten his ruine. Others were not sa|tisfied
with this delay; affirming that time would be more for his benefit, than theirs; and if
they would proceed by cold delatory gradations, Piero would run no hazard, but they
should run many. For the Magistrats (though they were his Enemies) suffering him to
enjoy the priviledges of the City; his friends would make him Prince (as had happened in
58) to their utter destruction: and that though that Counsel was honest and peaceable,

yet this was wiser and more secure, and therefore to be executed, whilst the minds of the
People were incensed: the way they proposed was to arm at home, and to entertain the
Marquess of Ferrara into their pay abroad; and when a Senate of their friends happened to
meet, then to rise, and secure themselves as well as they could. The result of all was, that they
should attend such a Senate, and then make the best of their time. Nicolo Fedmi (who
was employed as Chancellor) was one of this Council; who being tempted by greater, and
more practicable hopes, discovered the whole Plot to Piero, and gave him a list of the Con|spirators,
and a Catalogue of the subscriptions. Piero was astonished at the number and
quality of his adversaries; and upon consultation with his friends, it was concluded, that
he also should take subscriptions, and having committed the care of them to some of his
confidents, he found the Citizens so sickle and unstable, that many of them who had sub|scribed
to the Enemy came over, and obliged themselves to him. Whilst things were in
this distraction, the time came about in which the supream Magistracy was to be renewed;
to which Nicolo Soderini was advanced by the Gonfaloniere de Giustitia. It was a wonder
to see the concourse not only of the better sort of Citizens, but of the common People which
attended him to the Palace, and put on an Olive Garland upon his head by the way, (to
signifie that he was the Person upon whom the safety, and the liberty of their City did de|pend.)
By this, and many examples of the same nature it is evident, how inconvenient it is
to enter upon the Magistracy, or Government, with more then ordinary acclamation; for
not being able to perform as is expected (and for the most part more is required) the
People abate of their esteem, and come by degrees to despise you. Thomaso and Nicolo So|derini
were Brothers, Nicolo was a person of greater Spirit, but Thomaso the more prudent.
Thomaso being a friend to Piero and knowing the humor of his Brother; that he desired the
liberty of the City, and that the Government might be preserved without offence to any
body, he encouraged him to a new Squittini, by which means the Borsi might be filled
with the names of such Citizens as were lovers of liberty, and the Government continued
without violence, as he desired. Nicolo was easily persuaded by his Brother, and suffered
the time of his Magistracy to expire in the vanity of that opinion, and his friends which
were of the Conspiracy were well enough contented, as being already emulous of him, and
not desiring the reformation should fall out during his authority; presuming they could
effect it when they pleas'd, though another was Gonfaloniere. Whereupon his office ex|pired
with less honor than he entred upon it; by reason he had begun many good things,
but perfected nothing.
This accident fortified the party of Piero exceedingly; confirmed his friends, and brought
over such as were neuter: so that though all things were ready on all sides, they were de|laid
for several months, and not the least tumult appeared. Nevertheless Piero's party en|creasing,
his Enemies began to resent it, and met together, to perform that by force, which
they might more easily have done before by means of the Magistrates; in order to which
they concluded to kill Piero (who was at that same time sick at, Crreggi) and cause the
Marquess of Ferrara to advance towards the City; for when Piero was dead, they resolved
to come armed to the Palace and force the Senate to settle the Government as they should
direct: for though all of them were not their friends, yet they doubted not but to fright
them into a concurrence. Diotisalvi, to disguise his designe visited Piero very often; dis|coursed
with him about uniting the factions, and advised him very frankly. But Piero was
informed of the whole conspiracy, and besides Domenico Martegli had given him notice that
Francesco Neroni the Brother of Diotisalvi had been tempting him to their party, assuring
him of success: Hereupon Piero resolved to be first in arms, and took occasion from their
practices with the Marquess of Ferrara. He pretended he had received a Letter from Gic|vanni
Bentivogli Prince of Bologna, importing that the Marquess of Ferrara was with cer|tain
forces upon the River Albo, and that it was given out, his design was for Florence; upon
which intelligence, Piero pretended to arm, and (attended by a great number of armed
men) he came to the City. At his arrival his whole party took arms, and the adversary did
the same, yet not in so good order as Piero, for his men were prepared, and the other sur|prised.
Diotisalvi's Palacebeing not far from Piero's, Diotisalvi judged himself insecure at
home, and therefore went up and down, sometimes exhorting the Senate to cause Piero to
lay down his Arms; sometimes seeking out Luca, and encouraging him to be constant; but
the briskest and most couragious of them all was Nicolo Soderini, who taking Arms imme|diatly,Nicolo Sode|rini persuades Luca to take Arms against Piero.
and being followed by most of the Populace of his quarter, went to Luca's house, in|treated
him to mount, and march with him to the Palace for the security of the Senate, who
(he assured him) were of his side; by doing of which, the Victory would be certain; but
if he remained in his house, he would run the hazard of being slain by those who were ar|med,
or abused by those who were not; and then he would repent him when too late,

whereas now it was in his power by force of Arms to ruine Piero if he pleased: or if he de|sired
peace, it was more honorable to give conditions, than to receive them. But all his
Rhetorick could not work upon Luca; he had altered his mind, and received new pro|mises
of Alliances and rewards from Piero; and already married on of his Nieces to Giovan|ni
Tornabuoni; so that instead of being persuaded by him, he admonished Nicolo to lay
down, and return quietly to his house; for he ought to be satisfied, that the City should be
governed by its Magistrats: for whether he was satisfied or not, it would be so; all People
would lay down their Arms; and the Senate having the stronger party, would be Judges
of their quarrel. There being no remedy, and Nicolo having no where else to dispose him|self,
went back to his house; but before he departed he told him thus.
I cannot alone do this City any service. but I can prognosticate its miseries. The reso|lution
you have taken, will deprive your Country of its liberty; your self of your autho|rity;
me of my Estate; and others of their Country.
At the first news of this tumult, the Senate had caused their Palace to be shut up, where
they kept themselves close with the Magistrats, without appearing for either side: the Citi|zens
(especially those who had followed Luca seeing the party of Piero armed, and the o|ther
disarmed) began to contrive how they might shew themselves his friends, not how
they might express themselves his Enemies. Whereupon the principal Citizens, and the
heads of the factions met in the Palace before the Senators, where many things were deba|ted
relating to the Government of the City in that juncture, and the ways of reconciliation:
but because Piero could not be there in respect of his indisposition, all agreed to go to him to
his house, except Nicolo Soderini, who (having recommended his Children and family to the
protection of Tomaso) was retired to his Country house, to attend there, the conclusion of
these troubles, which he expected would be unhappy to him, and fatal to his Country.
The rest being arrived at Piero's Palace, one of them being deputed, complained to him of
the condition of the City by reason of the tumults;The Senate and chief Citi|zens attend Piero at his house. declared that they who took Arms first,
were most conscious of them; that understanding Piero was the Man, and his design un|known,
they were come to him to be informed from himself, and if it appeared to be for
the advantage of the City, they promised to comply. To which Piero replyed, that he who
takes Arms first is not in the fault, but he who gives the occasion: that if they considered more
seriously of their behaviour towards him, they would not wonder at what he had done for
his own preservation: for they would find it was their conventions in the night; their sub|scriptions,
and practices to defeat him both of his Authority and life, which had forced
him to his Arms, yet having extended them no farther than his own house, he conceived it
was good evidence his intentions were innocent, and rather to defend himself, than injure
any body else, that he desired nothing, but his own security, and had never given them oc|casion
to suspect him of other, that when the Authority of the Balia expired, he never at|tempted
to revive it in any extraordinary way; but was willing (if they were so themselves)
that the Magistrats should have the Government of the City; that Cosimo and his Sons
knew how to live honorable in Florence, either with or without the Balia; and that in 58
it was for their interest, not his, that it was restored. But this was not sufficient, he found
them of opinion, that whilst he was in Florence, there would be no safety, no tranquillity
for them: a thing truly so far from his belief, he could never have imagined or thought up|on
it, that his own friends and his Father should not endure to live with him in the same
City, seeing no action of his had ever express'd him otherwise, than a quiet and peaceable
Man.
Then turning about to Diotisalvi, and his Brothers who were all present, he reproached
them severely by the favours they had received from Cosimo; by the confidence he had pla|ced
in them; and the great ingratitude which they had returned (which reprimende was
delivered with so much zeal and efficacy, that, had not Piero himself restrained them, some
there present were so much enraged at their deportment towards him, they would certainly
have killed him) and at last he concluded, that what ever they and the Senate determined,
he would consent to, for he desired nothing of them but to live quiet and in peace. Hereup|on
many things were proposed but nothing concluded; only in general it was thought ne|cessary
the City should be reformed, and new Laws created: The then Gonfaloniere de Gi|ustitia
was Bernardo Lotti, a person in whom Piero had no confidence, and so resolved not
to do any thing whilst he was in office, which he conceived would be no great prejudice to
his affairs, because his time was almost expir'd. But at the election of Senatours in Septem|ber
and October following, 1466. Roberto Lioni was chosen Gonfaloniere, who was no
sooner settled in his office, but (all others thing being prepared to his hand) he called the
People together into the Piazza, and created a new Balia, all of Piero's creatures, who
fell presently upon the creation of new Magistrats, and chose them as Piero directed. Which

manner of proceeding so terrisied the heads of the adverse party, that they fled out of the
City most of them; Agnolo Acciaivoli to Naples, Diotisalvi Neroni, and Nicolo Soderini to
Venice. But Luca Pitti remained behind, presuming upon his late alliance, and the pro|mises;
which he had received from Piero:The Ene|mies of the Me|dici|depress'd Giovanni the Son of Neroni, at that time Archbi|shop
of Florence (to prevent the worst) banished himself voluntarily to Rome. All the
fugitives were proclaimed rebels; and the family of the Neroni dispersed. Many other Ci|tizens
were banished likewise, and consined to particular places; nor was this all; a solemn
procession was ordered, to give God thanks for the preservation of the State, and the unity
of the City: in the time of which solemnity, certain Citizens were apprehended, tortured,
and then part of them put to death, and part of them banished. But in all the inconstancy
and variations of fortune,Luca Pitti deserted. nothing was so remarkable as the fall of Luca Pitti. He quickly
learned the difference betwixt Victory and misfortune; betwixt honor, and disgrace, His house
(which was formerly thronged with the visits and attendancies of the better sort of Citi|zens)
was now grown solitary and unfrequented. When he appeared abroad in the streets,
his friends and relations were not only afraid to accompany him, but to owne or salute him;
some of them having lost their honors for doing it, some of them their Estates; and all of
them threatned, The noble structures which he had begun, were given over by the work|men;
the good deeds which he had done were requited with contumely, and the honors
he had confer'd, with infamy and disgrace. So that many persons who in his authority had
presented him largely, in his distress required it again. pretending it was lent, and no more,
and these very People who before commended him to the skies, cried him down again as fast,
for his ingratitude and violence: so that now when it was too late, he began to repent himself
that he had not taken Nicolo's advice, and died honorably seeing he could not live so. Ne|vertheless
Agnolo Acciaivoli being than at Naples, before he attempted any thing of inno|vation,
he resolved to try Piero, and see if there was no hopes of reconciliation; to which
purpose he writ to him this following letter.
I cannot but smile to observe the wantonness of fortune, and what sport she makes her
self in turning friends into Enemies,Agnolo's letter to Piero de Medici. and Enemies into friends, according to her own hu|mor
ad capriccio; you may remember how at the banishment of your Father (resenting
the injury done to him above any danger of my own) I lost my Country, and escaped
narrowly with my life. In Cosimo's days I refused no opportunity of honoring your fa|mily;
and since he died, I have entertained none to offend it. True it is the weak|ness
of your complexion, aud the minority of your Sons, gave some kind of disquiet, and
I was willing our Country might be put in such a posture, as to subsist after your Death;
what ever I have done, was only to that end; not against you so much, as for the be|nefit
of my Country: if that was an errour, I am sorry for it, and do hope the innocence
of my intention, and the service of my former actions may attone it: nor can I fear but
I shall find mercy in a Family which has had so long experience of my fidelity; or that
one single fault will be able to extinguish so many obligations. Piero having received
this Letter, by the same hand returned him this answer.
Your smiling at that distance, is the reason I weep not where I am: were you so mer|ry
in Florence,Piero's an|swer. I should be more melancholy at Naples. I grant you have been a well
wisher to my Father, and you confess he gratified you for it; so that if there be obligati|on
on any side, 'tis on yours, because deeds are more valuable than words; and if you have
been already rewarded for your good actions, it's but reasonable you should be punished
for your evil: your pretence of love to your Country cannot excuse you, for no body
but will believe the Medici as great lovers and propagators of their Country as the Acci|aivoli.
Live therefore where you are, in dishonor, since you had not the discretion to
live honorably here.
Agnolo upon the receipt of this letter, desparing of Pardon, removed his quarters to
Rome; wher associating with the Archbishop, and the rest of the exiles; they consulted
what was the best way of lessening the reputation of the Medici; which at that time was
tottering in Rome, and gave Piero no small trouble to sustain it; but by the assistance of his
friends, they failed of their design. Diotisalvi, and Nicolo Soderini on the other side, used
all possible diligence to provoke the Venetian Senate against their Country supposing its
Government being new, and ungrateful to many People, the first invasion would shake it,
and that it would not be able to stand. There was at that time in Ferrara Giovan Frances|co
the Son Palla Strozzi, who in the revolutions in 34 was banished with his Father
out of Florence: this Giovanni was a Man of great credit, and reputed as rich a Merchant as
any in the City. These new Rebels insinuating with him, persuaded him how easie it
would be to recover their Country when ever the Venetians would undertake it; and they
doubted not but they would undertake it, if part of the charge could be defrayed; other|wise

it was not to be expected: Giovanni was willing to revenge the injuries he had re|ceived;
believed what they said, and promised to assist with all the Mony he could make;
upon which Diotisalvi, and Soderini addressed themselves to the Doge.
Complained to him of their Banishment, which they pretended was for no other cause,
but that they were desirous their Country might be governed by the Laws; and the Magi|strats
(not a few of their Grandees) have the powe to put them in execution. Upon
this account it was, that Piero de Medici and his followers, having been used to a tyranni|cal
way, had taken arms by an artifice, disarmed them by a cheat, and banished them by
a fallacy, and as if this were not enough, God Almighty must be brought in, and made
an accessary to their cruelty, whilst in a solemn Procession, and the sacred exercise of their
devotion, many Citizens who (upon faith given that they should be safe) had remai|ned
behind, were seized, secured, tortured, and executed: a thing of most execrable
and nefarious example. To revenge the inhumanity of those actions, and avert the
judgments which they would otherwise pull down upon their Country, they knew not
where to apply themselves with more hopes then to that illustrious Senate which having
done so much for the preservation of their own liberty, must need have some compassion
for such as lost have theirs. They beseeched them therefore as, free-men, to assist them
against their Tyrants; as merciful, against the merciless; and remember them how the
Family of the Medici had defeated them of Lombardy, when Cosimo (contrary to the in|clinations
of all the rest of the City) assisted Francesco against them: so that if the equi|ty
of their cause did not move them, the justice of their own indignation might provoke
them,
These last words prevailed so far upon the Senate, that thy resolved, Bartolomeo Coligni
(their General) should fall upon the Dominion of the Florentines, and to that purpose
their Army being drawn together with all possible speed, and Hercules da Esti being sent by
Borso Duke of Ferrara, joyned himself with them. Their first enterprize was upon the Town
of Doadola which (the Florentines being in no order) they burned, and did some mis|cheif
in the Country about it. But the Florentines (as soon as Piero had banished the ad|verse
party) had entred into a new League with Galezzo Duke of Milan, and Ferrando
King of Naples;The Floren|tines invaded by the veneti|ant. and entertained Federigo Count of Urbin for their General: so that being
fortified by such friends, they did not much value their Enemies: for Ferrando sent his Son
Alfonso; and Galeazzo came in person (both of them with considerable forces) to their
relief; and all of them together made a head at Castracaro, a Castle belonging to the Flo|rentines
at the bottom of the Alps which descend out of Tuscany into Romagna. In the
mean time, the Enemy was retired towards Imola; so that betwixt the one and the other,
according to the custom of those times, there happened several light skirmishes, but no be|sieging
nor storming of Towns, nor no provocation to a battle on either side, both parties
keeping their tents, and staring one upon another, with extraordinary cowardize. This
manner of proceeding was not at all pleasing to the Florentines, who found themselves enga|ged
in a War, which was like to be expensive, and no profit to be expected: insomuch
that the Magistrats complained of it to those Citizens which they had deputed as commissa|ries
for that expedition; who replyed, That Galeazzo was wholly in the fault; and that having
more Authority than experience, he knew not how to make any advantagious resolution;
nor would he believe them which were able to instruct him, and that therefore it was im|possible
(whilst he was in the Army) that any great action should be atchieved. Here|upon
the Florentines addressed themselves to the Duke, and let him know.
That he had done a great honor (and it had been much for their advantage) in
coming personally to their assistance; for his very name and reputation had made their
Enemies retire: Nevertheless they could not but prefer his safety and the good of his
State, before their own; because whilst he was safe, they could not be capable of fear;
and if lost, they should be incapable of comfort. They could not therefore discharge
themselves, nor express the respect they had for him better, then by remembring him,
that (besides the danger where he was) it could not be secure for him to be any longer
at that distance from Milan; for being but young in the Government, and his Enemies
powerful and industrious; who knew what mischief they might meditate? and how ea|sily
execute it when they had done? so that they made it their request to him for the safe|ty
of his own person, and the preservation of his State, that he would leave only part of his
forces with them, and return himself with the rest.
Galeazzo was as well pleased with their Counsel, as they were to give it; and
without more ado returned from whence he came. The Florentine Generals (being rid of
this incombrance, and that it might appear to the World who was the impediment before)
advanced against the Enemy, so that they came presently to a battle, which continued half a

day without any disadvantage; for there was not one Man killed, a few Horse hurt, and
but a few Men taken prisoners. When Winter was come, and the time that their Armies
were accustomed to go into quarters, Bartolomeo rereated towards Ravenna; the Floren|tines
into Tuscany; and the forces of the King and the Duke into their several Countries:
but finding no tumult nor commotion in Florence, as they were promised by the Rebels;
and the Souldiers which were hired not being punctually payed; the Venetians thought fit
to treat, and in a short time a peace was concluded: this peace having deprived the rebels of all
hopes,Peace be+tween the Flo|rentines and the Venetians they divided, and went to several parts. Diotisalvi went to Ferrara, where he was
entertained and relieved by the Marquess Borso: Nicolo Soderini removed to Ravenna, where
he lived long with a small pension from the Venetians, and at last died: this Nicolo was
accounted a just and couragious Man, but slow, and irresolute: which was the cause that he
slipped an oportunity when he was Gonfaloniere, that he could never afterwards retrieve.
Grown insolent upon their success, those of the Florentines who were in power (as if they
fansied they had not prevailed, unless their cruelty did testify it,) plagued and tor|mented
not only their Enemies, but how ever else they thought good to suspect; and ob|tained
of Bardo Altovili to divest several Citizens of their honors, and that others should be
banished; which was so great a strengthening to that party, and depression to the other;
that they exercised the power which they had usurped, as if God and fortune had given
them that City for a prey.
These practices Piero understood not; and if he had, his ilness would not have permit|ted
him to redress them: for he was so stiff, and contracted with the Gout, he had the
use of nothing but his tounge, with which he could only admonish and advise them to live
civilly, and enjoy their Country in peace, and not be accessary to its destruction. To please
and entertain the People, he resolved to celebrate the Marriage of his Son Lorenzo, to whom
he had contracted Claricia a Daughter of the house of Ursina; which wedding was perfor|med
with a Pomp and magnificence answerable to the persons by whom, and for whom
it was made; several days were spent in Balls, in Banquets, and Shows, and to demonstrate the
Grandure of the House of the Medici, two martial spectacles were exhibited; one represen|ting
Horse and Men charging as in a field fight; the other the siege and expugnation of a
Town; both of them contrived and discharged with the greatest glory and gallantry ima|ginable.
Whilst affairs were in this posture in Florence, all Italy was at peace; but
under great apprehensions of the Turk, who advancing in his designs, had taken Negro|pont,
to the great scandal and detriment of all Christendom: Borgo Marquess of Ferrara
died about this time, and was succeeded by his Brother Hercules. Gismondo da Rimini di|ed
(a perpetual Enemy to the Church) and left the Dominion to his Son Roberto, who
was reckoned afterwards among the best Commanders of that age. Pope Paul died like|wise,
in whose place was created likewise Sextus called first Francesco da Savona, a Person
of mean or rather base extraction, but for his courage made General of the order of S. Fran|cis;
and after that, Cardinal: This Pope was the first which shewed to the World what
the Papacy could do: and that many things called errors before, might not only be excu|sed,
but hid and obtected by the Papal Authority. He had in his Family two persons
(Piero and Girolamo) who (as was Generally believed) were his natural Sons, though
they passed under more specious and honorable appellations. Piero being a Frier, was by
degrees promoted to the Cardinalship, with the Title of SanSesio. To Girolamo he gave
the Government of Furli, which he had taken by violence from Antonio Ordelaffi whose
predecessors had a long time been Princes of that City: this secular and ambitious way of
proceeding, procured his Holiness great estimation among the Princes of Italy; insomuch
as all of them desiring his friendship, the Duke of Milan gave to Girolamo, his natural
Daughter Catharine in Marriage, and in Dower with her, he gave him the City of Imola,
which by the like violence he had taken from Taddeo Alidossi. Betwixt this Duke and Fer|rando
the King, a new alliance was contracted; for Elizabeth the Daughter of Alfonfo,
(the Kings eldest Son) was Married to Giovan Geleazzo eldest Son to the Duke. In the
mean time Italy was full of tranquillity; no care incumbant upon those Princes, but to pay
their respects one to the other, and by mutual matches, new obligations, and leagues, to
fortifie and secure one another. Yet in the midst of this Peace, Florence was not without
its convulsions; the ambition and dissention of the Citizens distracting their affairs; and
Piero being interrupted by his own distempers, could not apply any remedy to theirs. How|ever
to discharge his Conscience, endeavour what he was able, and try whether he could
shame them into a reformation, he called them all to his House, and saluted them in this
manner.
I never imagined the time could come in which the carriage of my friends shouldPiero's speech to the florentines.
have made me inclinable to my Enemies; or the consequences of my Victory, have made

me wish I had been beaten. I thought my party had consisted of Men whose appetites
might have been bounded and circumscribed, and such as would have been satisfied to
have lived quietly and honorably in their own Country, especially after their Enemies were
expelled. But I find now, I was mistaken; ignorant of the natural ambition of the
World; and more particularly yours. It is not enough (it seems) for you to be chief
and Principal in so illustrious a City, and (though but a few) to have the honors, and
offices, and emoluments, with which heretofore a much greater number was satisfied. It
is not enough, to have the forfitures and confiscations of your Enemies divided among
you; it is not enough that (exempting your selves) you load, and oppress the rest
with taxes; and appropriate them to your own private uses when they come in, but you
must abuse and afflict your neighbours with all the circumstances of injury: you rob
them of their Estates; you sell them justice; you abhor the Laws; you oppress the
peaceable, and exalt the insolent: I did not think there had been such examples of ra|pine
and violence in all Italy, as I find in this City. Has this City given us the Authori|ty,
to Subvert it? Has it given us preheminence to destroy it? Has it honored us, to
afflict it? I do profess by the Faith of an honest Man, and declare here publickly to you
all, that if you persist in these courses, and force me to repent of my Victory, I will or|der
things so, that you shall have but little comfort in abusing it.
The Citizens replyed modestly at that time, but not a jot reformation; whereupon
Piero sent privatly to Agnolo Acciaivoli to meet him at Cafaggiolo, where they had long
discourse about the condition of the City; and it is not doubted but if he had lived, he would
have recalled his Enemies to have restrained the exorbitances of his friends; but death
would not suffer it,Piero de Me|dici dies. for after great conflicts both in his body and mind, in the 53 year of
his age, he died: his virtue, and his bounty could not be perfectly conspicuous to his
Country, being eclipsed by his Father, who died not long before him; and these few
years he survived, were wholly taken up either by his own sickness, or the dissention of his
friends. He was enterred in the Temple of San. Lorenzo near his Father, and his exe|quies
performed with a Pomp proportionable to his quality, and deserts. He left behind
him two Sons Lorenzo and Guiliano; pregnant, and hopefull enough of themselves, but the
tenderness of their age was that which made every body apprehensive, Among (or ra|ther
above) the principal of that Government was Thomaso Soderini, whose prudence and
authority was not only eminent in Florence, but in the Courts of all the princes of Italy
after the death of Piero, Tomaso had the respect of the whole City, most of the Citizens
flocking to his House, as their Chief; and many Princes directed their correspondencies to
him:Tomaso so|derini in great favour with the Florentines, de|clines it di|screetly. but he being wise, and sensible of his own fortune and the fortunes of his Family, re|fused
their correspondence; received none of their letters, and let the Citizens know, it
was not upon him, but the Medici they were obliged to attend: and that his actions might qua|drate
with his exhortations, having called all the chief families together in the Convent of S.
Antonio, he brought in Lorenzo and Guiliano de Medici amongst them, where after a long
and solid discourse about the condition of that City, Italy, and the several principalities
within it; he concluded that if ever they would live happily and in peace; secure against
foreign invasion, and dissention at home; it was necessary to continue their observance to
the family of the Medici, and to give those young Gentlemen the Authority of their prede|cessors;
for Men are not troubled at the promotion of ancient familes; but upstarts, as
they are suddenly advanced, are suddenly forsaken, and it has been always found more easie to
preserve a family in power (where time has worn out his Enemies) than to raise a new one
which will unavoidably be subject to new emulations: after Tomaso had spoke, Lorenzo be|gan,
and (though but young) delivered himself with so much gravity and composedness;
that he gave them great hopes of his future abilities; and before they parted both of them
were perfectly adopted. Not long after, they were installed in the dignities of their Fa|ther;
entertained as Princes of the Government; and Tomaso appointed their chief Mini|nister;
by which means they lived quiety for a while both abroad and at home,Lorenzo and Guiliano de Medici made Princes of the City. without the
least prospect or apprehension of troubles; but on a sudden, a new tumult unexpectedly a|rose
to desturb them, and given them a hint of their following miseries.
Among the Families which suffered with Luca Pitti, and his party, was the Family of
the Nardi; Salvestro and his brothers (the chief of that house) were first banished, and
then (upon the War with Bartolomeo Coglione) proclaimed rebels. Among the Brothers,
there was one of them called Bernardo, a brisk and couragious youth, who (not being able
to subsist abroad by reason of his poverty, and having no hopes of returning by reason of
the peace) resolved to attempt something that might be an occasion of reviving the War:
ai slight and inconsiderable beginning, producing great effects many times, because People
are generally more prone to assist and improve a commotion, than to contrive and begin it

Bernardo had good acquaintance in Prato, and in the Country about Pistoia, but more espe|cially
with the Palandre, which (though a Country family) was numerous, and brought
up, like the rest of the Pistolesi, in arms and in blood. He knew they were highly discon|tented,
as having been ill used in the time of the Wars by the Magistrats in Florence: he
knew likewise the disgusts of the Pratisi; the pride and rapacity of their Government, and
some body had told him how ready they were for any practice against the State: so that from
all these circumstances he conceived hopes (by debauching of Prato) of kindling such a
fire in Tuscany, as by supplying it by fewel, they should not be able to extinguish: he com|municated
his design with Diotisalvi, and inquired of him, in case Prato should be surpri|zed,
what assistance he could procure him from the Princes of Italy. Diotisalvi looked up|pon
the business as desperate and almost impossible; however seeing the part he was to bear
in it, was secure enough; and that the experiment was to be made at another Mans cost; he
encouraged him to go on, and promised him assistance from Bologna and Ferrara, if he could
but secure the Town for a fortnight. Bernardo (tickled with his promises, and persuading
himself his success would be good) conveyed himself privatly to Prato, and imparting his
designs to some persons, he found them readily disposed: the same compliance and alacrity
he found in the Palandre, and having agreed with them both of the time, and the place, he
sent the news immediatly to Diotisalvi. The Potesta or Governor of Prato at that time was
Cesare Pretucci; who being put in by them, preserved it for the Florentines. The Go|vernors
of such Towns had a custom to keep the keys of the castle themselves; yet (espe|cially
where there was no jealousie) if any of the Town desired to go in or out in the night,
they were so civil, as to suffer them: Bernardo understanding the custom, came himself,
and the Palandre with about a hundred armed Men, and lay close near the gate which
goes towards Pistoia,A Conspira|cy of the Nard. whilst those in the Town who were privy to the conspiracy, armed
likewise, and sent one of their number to the Governor to beg the favour of the keys, pre|tending
there was a Citizen which desired to enter. To Governor suspecting nothing,
sent one of the servants with the Keys, who being gone a convenient distance from the Pa|lace,
was knocked down, his charge taken from him; and the Gate being opened, Bernar|do
and his party were let in. Having entered, and discoursed a little while with their friends
in the Town, they divided into two bodies; one of them under the conduct of Salvestro
a Pratese, surprized the Castle; the other commanded by Bernardo, possess'd themselves of
the Palace, took the Governor and his whole Family Prisoners, and committed them to the
custody of some of his Men: which done, they set up a great cry for liberty in the Streets, and
upon it many of the People resorted to the Market place: It being now day, and the Magi|strats
informed that the Castle and Palace were surprized, and the Governor and all his Fa|mily
in Prison, they could not imagine from whence this accident should proceed. The
eight (who in that City were supream) met together in the Palace to consult what was to
be done. But Bernardo and his accomplices, having run some time about the streats, and
found few or no body come in; upon information that the eight were assembled, they
went directly to them, and Bernardo took occasion to let them know, that their design was
only to deliver their Town from servitude; and that if they would take Arms, and joyn
with them in it, they would create immoratal honor to themselves, perpetual peace to the
People; then he remembred them of their ancient Liberty, and compared it with their
present condition; and promised them such assistance in a few days, as the Florentines
should not be able to contend withal: besides he assured them he had intelligence in Flo|rence,
and they would show themselves as soon as they understood their success in this
Town: but the eight were not to be moved with bare words, and answered that they knew
not whether Florence was in liberty or bondage, nor did it belong to them to inquire;
this they knew that for their parts they desired no further liberty, then to continue under the
same Magistrats which had then the Government of Florence, from whose hands they had
never received any injury that might provoke them to take Arms against them: they admo|nished
him therefore to release the Governor, leave the Town as he found it; and with|draw
in time from an enterprize which he had rashly begun. But Bernardo was not to be
discouraged so easily; for seeing intreaties and fair means had no better success, he resolved
to try how far terror would work; and as a taste of what was to be expected, concluded
to put the Governor to Death; having caused him to be haled out of Prison: he gave or|ders
he should be hanged out of one of the Windows in the Palace: Petrucci was brought
almost to the Window with a rop about his neck, when he spied Bernardo attending to
see him executed; and turning to him, he said.
Bernardo you think by cutting me off, to make the Pratesi follow you; but the effect
will be quite contrary. The Veneration they bear to the Governors which are sent
hither from Florence, is so great, it will incense them to see me destroyed, and your cru|elty

to me, will turn to your ruine; so that 'tis that 'tis my life, not my death, must do your bu|siness;
if I command then what you think fit to direct, they will obey me before you,
and I following your direction, your design will be fulfilled.
Bernardo (who was no conjurer) thought his counsel was good, and therefore orde|red
him (out of a back window which looked into the Market-place) to require the obedi|ence
of the People, which as soon as he had done, he was carried back from whence he
came. The weakness of the Cospirators was by this time discovered; and several of the
inhabitants were got together, and Giorgio Ginori (a Knight of Rhodes) among the rest.
The Giorgio being the first who took Arms, advanced against Bernardo who was riding up
and down the Streets, sometimes persuading, and sometimes threatning the City. Ha|ving
found him and charged him with a considerable number that followed,Bernardo defeated and taken. Bernardo was
wounded, and taken prisoner, after which it was not hard to release the Governor, and
over-power the rest; for being but few, and divided into several parties, they were most
of them either taken or killed.
In the mean time the news of this accident arrived at Florence, and was represented
much greater than the truth. The first report was that Prato was surprized; the Governor
and his whole Family slain; the Town full of the Enemies forces; Pistoia in Arms, and seve|ral
Citizens of that City engaged in the Plot: so that of a sudden the Palace was full of Ci|tizens,
expecting orders from the Senate for what was to be done. There was in Florence
at that time an eminent Captain called Roberto San Severino; it was resolved to send what
forces they could get together of a sudden under his command towards Prato; that he should
advance as near it as he could, give them particular notice of all passages, and act, as he in
his discretion should see occasion. Roberto was presently dispatched, and marched with his
party as far as the Castello di Campi, when he was met by a messenger from Petrucci with
the news that Bernardo was taken, his party defeated, and all things in quite; so that he
marched back again to Florence, and not long after Bernardo was brought thither to be ex|amined
by the Magistrats. Being questioned upon several things, and particularly what
induced him to that enterprize, he replyed, that choosing rather to die in Florence, then to
live any longer in exile, he determined to do semething which might make him memo|rable
when he was dead. This tumult being composed almost as soon as begun, the Ci|tizens
began to return to their old way of security, thinking (without any regard or con|sideration)
to enjoy the profits of a Government which they had so lately re-established and
confirmed; from whence all those incovenences ensued, which are too often the followers of
peace; the youth being more vain and extravagant than formerly, squandred away vast
sums, in Cloaths, and Treats, and all manner of Luxury; and having nothing to do, spent
their whole time and Estates among dancing Masters, and Women: their whole study and
ambition was to be thought glorious in their habit; and smart and poinant in their dis|course,
for he that could retort or bite the most readily, was thought the gretest wit, and
had the greatest applause: and yet these effeminacies were much encreased, by the arrival of
the Duke of Milan, who with his Lady and whole Court was come to Florence (to fulfil a
pretended vow) where he was entertained with magnificene sutable to his quality,The Duke of Milan in Florence. and
the alliance betwixt them. Then was the first time it ever was seen in that City that in
Lent when all flesh was forbidden by the Church, it was eaten publickly, without dis|pensation,
or respect to the Laws of God or of Men. Among the rest of the Shows which
were made to entertain him, the Holy Ghost's descending upon the Apostles, being repre|sented
and exposed in the Church di S. Spirito; so many candles were used in the solemnity
that some of them took fire, and burnt the Church to the Ground, which was looked up|on
as a judgment, and a manifest expression of Gods anger towards us; if then the Duke
found the City of Florence full of niceness, and delicacy, and exorbitance in their manners,
he left them much worse when he went away; so that the soberer sort of the Citizens thought
it necessary for sumptuary Laws, and edicts of restraint for the regulation of expences in
Cloaths, Funerals, and Feastings, to confine them within the compass of frugality and dis|cretion.
In the midst of the peace, there happened a new and unexpected tumult in Tuscany, about
this Town of Volterra,Tumults in Volterra. it was the fortune of some of those Citizens to find a mine of Allum,
who knowing the usefulness of it, and the advantage which might accrew, that they might be
the better supplied with monies, and justified by better authority, they applied themselves
to some of the considerable Citizens of Florence, and made them sharers in the profits. The
business at first (as all things of that nature are) was little reguarded by the Volterrans, but
after, when they grew sensible of their gains, they strove too late, to do what at first might
have been easily prevented. They began to examine and argue it in the Councils, alledging
there was no reason a commodity found in the publick lands, should be converted to parti|cular

use: hereupon Embassadors were sent to Florence, and the cause referred to a
Committee of Citizens, who, being either bribed, or convinced, reported that the desires
of the People of Volterra, were (in their judgment) unjust. That they could not find
any reason why the defendants should be deprived of what by their own labour and industry
they had acquired; and that therefore the mine was in all equity to be continued to them:
though if they pleased they might command them to pay an annual sum of mony, as a fee
and acknowledgement of their Superiority. This being reported it rather encreased than les|sened
the mutiny of the Volterrans; nothing was discoursed of in the whole City, but this
affair: the People pressed hard for what they thought, themselves robb'd of: The Partizans
were as zealous to keep what they had got, and upon reference to the Florentines it was
confirmed to them; so that in a dispute, there was one eminent Citizen called Picorino
slain, and after him several more of his party, and their houses plundered and burned;
in the heat of their rage, they had much ado to forbear the same violence to the Florentine
Magistrats, the sierceness, of their fury being over, they sent Embassadors to Florence to re|present
to that Senate that if they would preserve to them their old priviledges, they would
continue their subjection, and maintain the City in its ancient dependance. But there was
great argument about the answer: Tomaso Soderini was of opinion the Volterrans were to
be received upon any terms, as thinking it dangerous as that time to kindle a fire so near
their own Houses: for he was fearful of the disaffection of the Pope and the power of the
King; nor durst he depend upon the amity either of the Duke or the Venetian, as not be|ing
certain of the courage of the one, or the fidelity of the other; harping still upon an
old adage, that a lean peace was better than a fat Victory. Lorenzo, on the other side, think|ing
this a fair opportunity to demonstrate his Wisdom, and his magnanimity together; and
the rather because encouraged by such as envy'd Tomaso, he declared against the tumult; re|solved
to punish them by force, and affirmed that if these were not corrected in terro|rem,
upon the least trivial and impertinent occasion, the rest of the Territories would do
the same, without any fear or reverence in the World. The result of all being that they
should be corrected; answer was returned to the Embassadors, that the Volterrans were
not to expect the continuation of their priviledges, having broken them themselves, and that
therefore they were either to submit to the Senate without any Capitulation, or to expect
the consequence of War. The Volterran Embassador being returned with this answer;
they prepared for their defence; fortified their Town; and sent for supplies to all the Prin|ces
of Italy; but none of them gave them any encouragement, but the Siennesi, and the
Governor of Piombino.
The Florentine, on the other side, placing much of their success in their speed, dispatch|ed
away 10000 foot and 2000 Horse under the command of Federigo Lord of Urbin, who
falling upon the Country of Volterra, did easily subdue it; after which he sat down before
the City; but that standing high, and the hill being steep, it was not to be assaulted but
on that side where the Church of S. Alessandro stood. The Volterrans for their better de|fence
had hired about 1000 Souldiers, who observing the Florentines resolution to carry it,
and that they were very strong in their Leaguer, believing it untenable, they began to be
remiss and careless in their duties; but in anything of mischief to their Masters, they were
vigorous enough: so that the poor Citizens being assaulted without, and abused within,
began to incline to a peace; but not being admitted to conditions, they were glad to throw
themselves into the arms of their Enemies; who having caused them to open the Gates,
the greatest part of the army marched in, and advancing to the Palace where their Priori were
assembled, they commanded them to return to their houses; but by the way one of them
was unluckily Pillaged and reviled by a Souldier,Voltrra surrendred and sacked. and from that Action (the disposition of
Mankind prompting him more naturally to mischief than good) proceeded the destruction
of that City, which for a whole day together was robb'd, and rummaged by the Souldiers,
neither Women, nor Children, nor Churches, nor any place being exempt from the ra|pacity
as well of their Mercenaries, as Enemies. The news of this Victory was entertained
in Florence with extraordinary joy, and being Lorenzo's own enterprize, it turned highly to
his reputation: and one of his most intimate friends upbraided Tomaso Soderini by his Coun|sel
to the contrary; what think you now, Sir (said he to him) Volterra is won? To whom
Tomaso replyed, I think it rather lost; for had you received it upon terms, it might have
been serviceable, and contributed to the security of this City but being so be kept by
force it will be a trouble and weakness to you in time of War, and an expence and in|convenience in time of Peace.
In those dayes, the Pope being desirous to keep the Lands of the Church in their natural
obedience, had caused Spoliro to be sacked, which Town by instigation of the Factions
within it, had been in rebellion; and the City of Castello having been in the, same contuma|cy,

was afterwards besieged. In that Town Nicolo Vitelli was Prince, who retaining a
great correspondence and friendship with Lorenzo di Medici, had supplies sent him from Flo|rence.
though not enough to defend Nicolo, yet sufficient to sow the seeds of such enmity
betwixt the Pope and the Medici, as produced most pernitious effects. Nor had it been
long before they had discovered themselves, had not the death of Piero Cardinal di S. Si|sto
intervened. For that Cardinal (having travelled thorow all Italy, and spent some time
both at Venice and Milan, in honor (as he pretended) to the Marquess of Ferrara's wed|ding)
had sifted the Princes to see how they stood inclined to a difference with the Floren|tines:
but being returned to Rome, he died, not without suspition of being poisoned by
the Venetians, out of an apprehension of his power, when ever he should have opportuni|ty
to exert it; for though his humor and extraction were mean, and his education retired,
in a Covent, yet upon his promotion to the Cardinalship, he discovered more pride and
ambition, than was becoming not only a Cardinal, but a Pope. For he had the vanity
to make a feast at Rome which cost him above 20000 Florens and would have been thought
an extravagance in the greatest King of his time. Pope sixtus having lost his Minister,
proceeded more coolly in his designs nevertheless the Florentines, the Duke, and the Ve|netians
entred into a League;Italy in two Factions. Sixtus and the King of Naples entred into another, and
left room for several other Princes to come in if they pleased. By this means all Italy
was divided into two factions, every day producing something or other which augmented
the feuds; and particularly a dispute about the Isle of Cyprus, to which Ferrando pretended,
but the Venetian had got the possession; upon which the Pope and Ferrando confederated
more strictly: the great Captain of those times, and the most eminent for conduct was Fe|derigo
Prince of Urbin, who had served under the Florentine a long time: that their League
might not have the advantage of such a General, the Pope and Ferrando resolved, if pos|sible
to debauch him from them, and to that end both of them invited him to Naples. Fe|derigo
obeyed, with great astonishment, and displeasure to the Florentines, concluding
he would run the same fate which Giacopo Piccinino had done before him; but they were ut|terly
mistaken; for Federigo returned with great honor from Naples and Rome, and
was made General, of their League. In the mean time the Pope and the King were not idle
but still feeling and tempting the Senats, of Romagna, and Sienna, to make them their
friends, and enable themselves thereby to be revenged on the Florentines; of which the
Florentines having advertisement, they provided such remedy against their ambition, as
would consist with their time; and having lost Federigo, they entertained Roberto do Pi|mino
into their pay: they renewed their Leagues with the Citizens of Perugia, and the Se|nate
of Faenza.
The Pope and the King pretended that the grounds of their dissatisfaction was, for that
they had seduced the Venetians from their League, and associated with them themselves,
and the Pope did not think that he could preserve the honor and reputation of the Church,
nor Count Girolamo his Sovereignty in Romagna, whilst the Venetian and Florentine were
united. The Florentines on the other side feared that they did not desire to seperate them
from the Venetians so much, to make them their friends, as to enable themselves more easi|ly
to injure them; so that for two years together Italy remained under these jealousies, and
diversities of humors, before any tumult broke out. The first which happened (and that
was no great one) was in Tuscany. Braccio of Perugia (a Person as we have said before,
of great reputation in the Wars) left two Sons Oddo,Troubles in Tuscany. and Carlo, whilst the last was very
young, his Brother was slain unhappily in a tumult in the Val di Lamona. And Carlo
(when capable for his age) was preferred by the Venetians to a command in their Army,
out of respect to the memory of the Father and the hopefulness of the Son. The time of
his Commission expired about that time, and Carlo would not suffer it to be renewed by
the Senate; being resolved to see whether his own reputation, or his Fathers, could bring
him back again to Perugia. To which the Venetians readily consented, as People which
added something to their Empire, by every commotion: Carlo therefore, marched into
Tuscany, but finding the Perugians in League with the Florentines, and his enterprize by
consequence more uneasie then he expected, that nevertheless he might do something wor|thy
thy to be talked of, he assaulted the Siennesi (pretending an old debenture to his Father
for service he had done them) and fell upon them with such fury, that their whole Coun|try
was overrun. The Siennesi seeing themselves so fiercely invaded (and being natural|ly
jealous of the Florentines) persuaded themselves, it was done by their consent, and
made their complaints to the Pope and the King: they sent Embassadors likewise to Flo|rence;
who complained of the injuries they had received; and remonstrated, that with|out
their privacy and connivance Carlo could never have assaulted them so securely. The
Florentines excused themselves, assuring them they would employ their greatest interest that

Carlo should not injure them any farther; and that in what way soever their Embassadors
should propose, they would require him to desist: of which proceeding Carlo complained
as much on the other side, declaring that for not having supplied him, the Florentines had
robb'd themselves of a considerable acquist and him of great honor, and reputation; for
he promised them the possession of that City in a short time; so much cowardize he had
observed in the People, and so much disorder in their defence: whereupon Carlo drew off,
and retired to his old Masters the Venetians: and the Siennesi (though delivered by the
Florentines means) remained full of disgust, as not thinking it an obligation to rescue them
from a calamity they had brought upon their heads. Whilst the affairs in Tuscany were
carried on in this manners, by the Pope and the King, there fell out an accident in Lom|bardy
of greater importance, and threatened greater destruction. There was a person called
Cola (of Mantoua) who taught the Latine tongue to several young Gentlemen in Milan;
this Cola, being a learned, but ambitious man, out of pique to the Dukes conversation,
or some private exceptions of his own, took occasion in all his discourse, wherever he came,
to declaim against subjection to an ill Prince; and to magnifie their felicity whose fortune it
was to be born, and brought up in a Commonwealth, affirming that all famous Men, had
their education; not under Princes but Republicks; the latter prferring them as virtuous,
the other destroying them as dangerous. The Gentlemen with whom he had entred into
more particular familiarity were Giovanandrea Lampognano, Carlo Visconti, and Girolamo
Olgiatto, and to these he had may times inculcated the excellence of the one Government,
and the periciousness of the other, and by degrees he became so confident both of their
courage and inclination, that he persuaded them to a solemn oath, that as soon as their
age would give them leave, they should employ all their faculties to redeem their Country
from the Tyranny of their Prince.
The young Gentlemen, full of his documents, and a desire of observing their oaths: de|testing
the courses of the Duke, and resenting some particular injuries of their own, were
impatient to put his directions in execution. Galeazzo was in his carriage both cruel and
lascivious (each of which good qualities were sufficient to make him odious) it was not e|nough
for him to debauch and vitiate the noblest Ladies of the City, but he took delight to
publish it; no man (in his judgment) was handsomly punished who was not executed
with some unusual circumstance of cruelty. He was suspected likewise to have murdered
his Mother, for not fancying himself Prince enough, whilst she was in the way, he beha|ved
himself so towards her, that she desired to retire to Cremona (which was the place of
her dower) in which journey she was surprized with a sudden sit of sickness, and died,
and her death, by many People, imputed to her Son. By tampering with or reflect|ing
upon some Ladies of their relations, Galeazzo had highly disobliged both Carlo and
Girolamo; and to Giovanandrea he had refused to give the possession of the Abbey of Mi|ramando,
which was granted to his predecessors by the Pope: these private injuries, egg'd
on the young Gentlemen to revenge themselves, and deliver their Country; presuming if
they could kill him, not only the Nobility, but the whole body of the People would fol|low
them: resolved therefore upon the fact, they met many times to consult of the way,
and their old familiarity rendered them unsuspected. Whilst they were contriving their
business, to make themselves more dexterous and couragious when they came to it, their
way was to strike and stab one another with the sheaths of those daggers which they had pre|pared
to do the work,Conspiracy against the Duke of Milan. sometimes upon the arms, and sometimes upon the breasts of one
another. At length they came to consider of the time and the place: in the Castle it was
thought unsafe; a hunting, dangerous and uncertain; a walking, difficult, and unpra|cticable;
in the conventions impossible; at length it was concluded he should be assassinated
at some show or publick festivity, to which he would certainly come, at which time upon
sundry pretences they might have opportunity to assemble their friends. They concluded
likewise, that if any of them, upon any occasion whatever should be absent, or apprehen|ded
the rest should proceed, and kill him upon the place.
In the year 1476 Christmas coming on, and the Duke accustom'd on S. Stephens day
with great solemnity to visit the Church of that Martyr, they pitched upon that for the time
and the place. The morning arriving, they caused some of their principal friends and servants
to arm, pretending they were to assist Giovanandrea who (contrary to the inclinations of
some of his Enemies) was to bring certain pipes of Water into his grounds for his greater
convenience: being armed according to directions, they conducted them to the Church,
alledging that they would get leave of the Prince to justifie what might happen: they cau|sed
several others likewise of their friends and allies to meet there, upon several pretences,
presuming when the stroke was struck, and the business done to their hand, they would
hall in then without any difficulty or scruple. Their resolution was, as soon as the Duke

was killed, to get all those armed Men at their heels, and to march into that part of the
Town where they thought they could raise the People with most ease, and persuade them
to arm against the Dutchess, and the Ministers of the State not doubting but the People
would readily follow them, being much distressed for want of provisions and promised
(as they intended) the houses of Cecco Simonetta, Giovanni Botti, Francesco Lucani, and
all the rest of the Governors, to plunder. Having laid their design thus, and encouraged
one another toxecute it bravely, Giovanandrea with his accomplices, went to Church be|times,
and heard Mass together, after which Giavanadrea turning towards the image of San.
Ambrogio, he said, Most, venerable Patron of our City, thou knowest our intention, and for
what end we expose our selves to so many dangers; be I beseech you kind and propitious to our
enterprize, and by favouring of justice, let the World see how much injustice displeases you.
To the Duke on the other side, before side, before he came to Church, many things happened which
seemed to presage his Death. When he dressed himself that morning, he put on a Coat of
mail which he usually wore, but on a sudden thinking it unhandsome or troublesom, he
caused it to be pulled off and laid by. He had a mind to hear Mass in his own Chappel, but
his Chaplain was gone to Saint Stephens Church, and carried all the implements along
with him; having news of that, he ordered the Bishop of Como, should officiate for him,
but he excused himself upon very reasonable impediments: so that he was necessitated (as
it were) to go to Church: before he went, he caused Giovan Galeazzo and Hermes, his
Sons to be brought to him, and when they came, he kissed and embraced them, as if he was
never to see them again; at length (and very loath) being parted from them, he resol|ved
to go to Church, and marching out of the Castle betwixt the Embassadors of Ferrara
and Mantoua, he went towards S. Stephens. The conspirators in the mean time, to give the
less suspicion, and avoid the cold, which at that time was very great, were go up into a
Chamber belonging to the Arch-priest, who was of their acquaintance; but hearing the Duke
was coming they went down and placed themselves in the Porch, Giovanandrea and Girola|mo
on the right hand, and Charles on the left. Those who marched before the Duke were
already entred, then came the Duke himself encompassed with a great multitude of People.
As is usual in such pompous solemnities. The first which addressed themselves to their work
was Giovanandrea,The Duke of Milan slain. and Girolamo, who pretending to make room, pressed up to the Duke, and
with short daggers which they had ready drawn in their sleeves, they stab'd him. Giovanan|drea
gave him two wounds, one in the belly, the other in the throat: Girolamo struck him
in the throat likewise, and in the belly, Carlo Visconti being placed nearer the door, the
Duke was past him before he was assaulted, and therefore he could not strike him before he
was dead, however he must do his share, and with a schine gave him two deep wounds up|on
his shoulders; his blows were so sudden and thick, he was cut down and dead, before
almost any body perceived it. Nor had he time to do or say more than to call upon the name
of our Lady, (and that but once) as he fell. The Duke being slain, great hubub was rais'd,
many Swords drawn, and (as it happens frequently in such cases) many people ran in great
confusion about the streets, without any certain knowledge of what had passed. However those
who were about the Duke, had seen him killed, and knew who they were that did it, pressed
hard upon them to revenge it.
Giovanandrea being willing to have disengagedhimself, got out of the church, thrust himself
among the women who were there in great numbers upon their knees, but being intangled,
and stopped by their coats, a Moor (who was one of the Dukes foot-men) got up to him, and
killed him: Carlo was slain also by those who were by; but Girolamo Oligato got out of the
Church among the crowd; for seeing his companions dead, and not knowing whither to be|take
himself, he went to his own house, but was refused by his Father and his Brothers: his
Mother having more commiseration recommended him to a Priest who had been an ancient
friend of that family which Priest changed habits with him, and conveyed him to his house;
where he remained two days in hopes some tumult or other would fall out, and he might
have opportunity to save himself. But finding he was mistaken in that, and fearing to be
found out where he was, he disguised himself, and endeavoured to get off, but was discover'd,
secur'd, and delivered up to the Magistrate, to whom he confessed the whole process of the
Conspiracy. This Girolamo was about twenty three years old, no less couragious and resolute
at his death, than at the perpetration of the fact. Being strip'd and the Executioner with his
knife in hand ready to give the stroke, he spake these words in Latine Mors acerba, fama
perpetua, stabit vetus memoria facs. This Plot was carried on with strange secrecy, and execu|ted
with prodigious courage by these unhappy young gentlemen: but being neither follow'd
nor defended by those whom they expected, they miscarried, and were slain. Let Princes by
this example live so as to make themselves honor'd and belov'd, that no body may hope to
kill then and escape; and let other People have care of relying upon the multitude too

far, how discontented soever; for in their distress they will be sure to forsake them. This ac|cident
put all Italy into an amaze, but much more what happen'd in Florence not long after;
for that brake the Peace of all Italy which had continued for 12 years, as shall be shown in the
next Book, whose end will be no less sad and deplorable, than the beginning is bloody and
terrible.


THE
HISTORY
OF
FLORENCE.
Book VIII.
THe beginning of this eight Book falling betwixt two Conspiracies, the one Execu|ted
at Milan, and already described; the other at Florence, and remaining to be re|lated;
it would have been convenient (according to my custom) to have said some|thing
of the quality and importance of Conspiracies, and I should willingly have
undertaken it, had it not been done in another place, and the subject too co|pious
to be passed over with brevity. Waving therefore a matter which would require so
much consideration, and is else where amply discoursed; I shall tell, how the Family of
the Medici (having subbued the adversaries which openly opposed them) to make them|selves
absolute in the City, and reduce the rest to a civil submission, were necessiated to
disable those who were privatly their Enemies. For whilst the Medici were but equal in
authority, and as it were but in competition with other great Families; the Citizens
which emulated their greatness, might oppose them publickly without danger, because the
Magistrats being free and independent, neither party was afraid, till one of them was sup|press'd.
But after the Victory in 66 the Government devolving wholly upon the Medici,
they exercised it with so much rigor that those who were discontented were forced to com|port
themselves patiently under it, or by private and clandestine machinations to
endeavour to remove it; which seldom and with great difficulty succeeding,
they most commonly ruined the Conspirators, and augmented their Grandeur, against
whom they were contrived. So that a Prince, according to that method to be deposed, if
he be not killed dead, (as the Duke of Milan) which happens but rarely, he breaks forth
into greater authority; and how good so ever before, becomes bad any tyrannical. For the
practices of those Men, give him occasion to fear; fear, to secure himself; security, to be
insolent; and from thence springs such aversions and hatred as is commonly his ruine; so
that in conclusion treason does usually destroy the contrivers, and ruine them in time against
whom they conspired.

Italy (as we said before) was divided into two factions the Pope and the King of
Naples made one; the Venetians, the Duke of Milan, and the Florentines made the other;
and though betwixt them War was not solemnly declared, yet daily provocations were
given on both sides, and the Pope very busie in his designs against Florence. Philippo di
Medici the Archbishop of Pisa being dead, in crossnes to that Family, his holiness invested
Francesco Salviati in that Bishoprick as knowing him to be their Enemy; and the Senate of
Florence refusing him possession, new quarrels arose which created much trouble. Hereup|on
the family of the Pazzi was encouraged at Rome, and the Family of the Medici, affront|ed
in every thing. The Family of the Pazzi, for quality and estate, was the most illustri|ous
in Florence. The chief of them was Messer Giacopo, who for his wealth and Nobility
was mad a knight by the People: this Giacopo had only one natural Daughter living, but se|veral
Nephews by Piero, and Antnio his Brothers: the chief of them, were Guilielmo, Fran|cesco,
Rinato, Giovanni, and (after them) Andrea, Galeotto, and Nicolo. Cosimo di
Medici observing the Grandeur of that Family, had married Bianca his Niece, to the el|dest,
Guilielmo, in hopes by that alliance to remove the jealousie and animosity which was
then betwixt the families. But (so uncertain and fallacious are all humane designs) it
proved quite contrary. For those who were of Lorenzo's cabal, persuaded him it was dan|gerous,
and a diminution to his authority, to advance such Citizens as were wealthy and
potent; whereupon Giacopo and his Nephews were not preferred to those dignities which
(in the opinion of other People) they deserved. This gave occasion of disgust to the Paz|zi,
and apprehension to the Medici;Animosity betwixt the Pazzi and the Medici. and the increase of the one, gave matter for the aug|mentation
of the other. So that in all things where other Citizens were entertained, the
Pazzi were rejected by the Magistrats. The Counsel of eight (upon a trivial occasion,
without respect and difference usually shown to Persons of his quality) recalled Frances|co
de Pazzi from Rome, and required his residence in Florence. Hereupon the Pazzi com|plained
highly of the Government, and spake bitterly of them wherever they came, which
produced more suspition in the Government, and more injury to themselves. Giovanni de
Pazzi was married to the Daughter of Giovanni Boromei a very rich man, who being dead
without other Children, his Estate descended to his Daughter. Notwithstanding, Carlo
his Nephew got possession of part, and refused to surrender. The controversie coming to a
hearing, it was decreed that Carlo should keep his possession, and the Daughter was defea|ted:
which injustice, the Pazzi imputed wholly to the malevolence of the Medici; of
which Giuliano complained many times to his Brother Lorenzo, admonishing him to have
a care lest Grasping at too much, he rob'd himself of all. But Lorenzo being young, and
elated with his power, would have a hand in every thing, and all must be acknowledged
from him. The Pazzi being too noble and opulent, to swallow so many affronts, be|gan
to cast about how they might revenge themselves. The first who brake the ice, was
Francesco, who being more sensible, and couragious than the rest, determined to recover
what was his right, or to lose what he had.
Retaining an implacable hatred to the Government at Florence, he lived most common|ly
at Rome, where he employed great sums of Mony, as other Florentine Merchants did u|sually
do. Having an intimate acquaintance with Count Girolamo, they complained to
one another oftentimes of the inhumanity of the Medici, at length they came to a solemn
debate, and it was concluded that for the one's recovery of his Estate and the others living
freely in that City, it was necessary the present Government in Florence should be subverted,
which could not be done, but by killing Giuliano, and Lorenzo. They were confident
(having first convinced them of the easiness of the fact) the Pope and the King of Naples,Conspiracy against Loren|zo and Guilian di Medici.
would give their consents. Having entertained these thoughts betwixt themselves, they
thought fit to communicate with the new Archbishop of Pisa; who being naturally ambi|tious,
and lately disobliged, most readily embraced it: consulting themselves what mea|sures
were to be taken, it was resolved that Giacopo de Pazzi should be drawn in, without
whose concurrence, the design was like to be more difficult. To this purpose it was con|cluded
that Francesco de Pazzi should repair immediately to Florence; and the Count and
Archbishop continue at Rome to be near the Pope when things should be fit to be imparted
Francesco finding Giacopo more formal and untractable then he desired and signifying it to
Rome, it was resolved to apply greater authority to dispose him, whereupon the Archbi|shop
and the Count communicated the whole affair with Giovan Baptist a one of his Holi|ness
his Generals.
This Giovanni was a man of great reputation in war; and particularly obliged both by
the Count, and the Pope. Nevertheless he objected the great danger and difficulties of the

enterprize, which the Archbishop endeavoured to refel by urging the assistance they were to
expect both from the Pope, and the King of Naples. The hatred the Citizens of Florence
bare to the Medici: the number of relations and friends which would follow the Salviati,
and the Pazzi; the easiness to kill them, by reason of their frequent walking alone about
the City without either guards or suspition: and (after they were dead) the small or no
opposition to be expected in the change of the Government: which allegations Giovanni
Battista could not absolutely believe, because he had been assured the contrary by several
considerable Citizens. Whilst these things were in this suspence, it happened that Carlo
Lord of Faenza fell sick, and was given over for dead. Hereupon the Count and Arch-Bishop
conceived they had a fair opportunity to dispatch Battista to Florence, and thence
into Romagna, under pretence of recovering certain Towns which Carlo of Farenza had
taken from them. The Count therefore commissioned Battista to wait upon Lorenzo, and
in his Name to desire his advice how he was to behave himself in Romagna: after which he
was to visit Francesco di Pazzi, and Giacopo di Pazzi, and seeing if he could engage them in
the design: and that he might carry the Popes authority along with him, they appointed
him before he departed to receive his Holiness his Commands, who promised what could
be imagined for the promotion of the enterprize: Battista departing speedily from Rome,
arrived at Florence; consulted Lorenzo according to his instructions, was very civilly re|ceived,
and so wisely and amicably answered in all his demands, that Battista was surprized,
and began to look upon him as courteous, discreet, a friend to the Count, and one that
had been maliciously misrepresented. However, he was to pursue his orders, and visit
Francesco; he being at Lucca; he went directly to Giacopo, and upon the first motion found
him very averse. But before he went away the Popes recommendation sweetned him so
that he told Battista he might proceed in his journy to Romagna, and by that time he came
back, Francesco would be in Florence, and they would talk father of the business: Batti|sta
went to Romagna and returned; pursued his pretended transactions with Lorenzo; when
he had done with him, went to the Pazzi, and ordered things so that Giacopo was drawn
in upon ferious consultation of the way. Giacopo was of opinion their design was impossible
whilst both the Brothers were together in Florence; That they had better attend till Lo|renzo
went to Rome, which by report would be certain, and in a very short time. Frances|co
was willing enough to have had Lorenzo at Rome, but if the worst came to the worst,
and he did not go thither, they might be sure to kill them both together at some wedding,
some show, or some act of devotion: as to their foreign assistance, it was thought con|venient
that the Pope should send his forces against Castello de Montone, having just occasion
of invading the Count Carlo, for the troubles and tumults he had raised in the Country of
Perugia and Sienna; Notwithstanding they came to no positive resolution at that time; on|ly
they agreed that Francesco di Pazzi, and Giovan Battista should return to Rome, and
there determine of all things with his Holiness, and the Count. The whole matter being
redebated solemnly at Rome, they came to this conclusion, (the enterprize against Montone
being confirmed) that Giovan Francesco da Tolentino (an officer of the Popes) should
go into Romagna and Lorenzo da Castello into his Country; each of them get together what
forces they were able, and keep them ready to be disposed of, as the Archbishop Salviati,
and Francesco dei Pazzi should order; who being come to Florence with Giovan Battis|ta,
they prepared all that was necessary; and King Ferrando's Embassador assured
them of his Masters utmost assistance. The Archbishop, and Francesco being arrived at
Florence, they persuaded into their party Giacopo the Son of Poggio, a learned youth, but
ambitious, and studious of new things. That drew in likewise two Giacopo Salviati's,
one of them a Brother, the other a Kinsman of the Archbishop's. They hired Bernardo
Bandini, and Napoleone, two valiant young French Gentlemen, who had been much ob|liged
to the Family of the Pazzi. Of Foreigners, besides them two, they entertained
Antonio da Volterra, and one Stephano a Priest, who taught the Latine tongue to Giacopo's
Daughter,Rinato dei Pazzi dissuades from the enter|prize, but in vain. and lived in his house.
Rinato dei Pazzi (a wise and student Man, and one who very well understood the con|sequences
of such Plots) consented not to it, but rather detested it, and by all plausible
ways endeavoured to dissuade it. The Pope had maintained at Pisa to study the Canon-Law,
Rafaelo di Riario nephew to the Count Girolamo, from which place he was recalled
by his Holiness, and promoted to a Cardinalship. It was judged commodious by the Con|spiracy,
that this Cardinal should come to Florence for the better concealment of their de|sign,
seeing that in his equipage all such of their confederats as were necessary, might be
conveyed into the Town, which would much facilitate the work. Accordingly the Car|dinal
arrived, and was lodged by Giacopo dei Pazzi at a Country house of his at Mentughi,
not far from Florence. They desired by his means that Lorenzo, and Guiliano might be

brought together, and it was resolved that the first opportunity they should be killed. It
was contrived then to make an entertainment for the Cardinal at Ftesole, but by accident,
or on purpose, it fell out that Guiliano was not there; so that that design being defeated, their
next was to invite the Cardinal to Florence, and thither they made no question but both
the Brothers would come: the 26 of April 1478 was appointed to be the day. The night
before, they met all together, and prepared and disposed all things for execution the next
morning; but the day being come, news was brought to Francesco, that Guiliano was not
there: upon that, the chief of them met together again, and concluded the business was
no longer to be delayed, for being communicated to so many, it was not possible to conceal
it: so that they determined without more ado, to assassinate him in the Church of Santa
Riparata, when (the Cardinal being present) both the Brothers they presumed would
be of course. They appointed Giovanni Battista to attack Lorenzo, and Francesco dei Pazzi
and Bernardo Bandini, to do as much to Guiliano. But Giovan Battista excused himself;
the former familiarity he had had with Lorenzo, or some other accident having mollified
his heart: he pretended his courage would not serve him to commit such an act in the
Church, as would add sacriledge to his treason, and his denial was the first step to the destru|ction
of them all; for being straitned in time, they were forced to depute Antonio da Vol|terra,
and Stephano the Priest, to that office, two persons very unapt for such an action
both in respect of their nature, and education; and certainly if in any thing a resolute, and
great mind (accustomed by long experience, to cruelty and Blood) be necessary, it is in
this case where Princes are to be killed. Having concluded of their time, and other cir|cumstances,
there was nothing behind but the signal when they were to begin; which was
when the Priest which celebrated the principal Mass, should receive the Sacrament himself:
at which time the Archbishop of Salviati with his own followers, Giacopo di Poggio with
his should possess themselves of the Palace of the Senate, that, either by persuasion or
force the Senate might be brought over to their side, as soon as the Brothers were slain.
Upon this resolution they went to the Church where the Cardinal and Lorenzo were al|ready
in their seats. The Church was thronged with people, and Divine Service begun,
when it was observed that Guiliano was not there, whereupon Francesco dei Pazzi and Ber|nardo
who were designed to murder him; went to him to his house, and with intreaties
and other Artifice, got him along with them to the Church. It is very remarkable, and
not often to be matched, that with so horrid, and detestable a design at their hearts, they
could carry themselves with that tranquillity and composedness, for all the way as they pas|ed
they entertained him with youthful and pleasant discourse; and such was the security
of Francesco that under pretence of caressing and embracing, he felt about his Body to see
whether he was armed. Guiliano and Lorenzo both, knew well enough that the Pazzi
bore them no good will, and that with all their hearts they would depose them if they could;
but they believed whenever they attempted against them it would be legally, and without
any violence upon their persons, and therefore suspecting nothing of danger in that kind,
they dissembled as much kindness to the Pazzi, as the Pazzi did to them. The assassines
being ready, (those who were to kill Lorenzo, by the help of the crowd being got up to
him without any suspition, on that side, and Guiliano's on the other) the sign was given,
and Bernardo Bandini, with a short dagger provided on purpose, stabbed Guiliano into the
breast, who passing a step or two forward, fell down upon the ground, Francesco dei Paz|zi
threw himself upon him stabbed him all over, and struck with such fury, that he hit his
own leg, and made a desperate wound: Antonio and Stephano in the mean time attempted upon
Lorenzo, and making several strokes at him, they wounded him slightly in the throat and no
where else; for either by their own faint heartedness, or his courage in defending himself, or
the interposition of those who were by, all of them were put off, and their whole enterprize
miscarried: whereupon they fled in great terror, and hid themselves as well as they could; but
being found they were shamefully put to death, and their bodies dragged about the City.
Lorenzo on the other side, joyning with those friends he had about him, betook himself to
the vestry, and stood upon his guard. Bernardo Bandini seeing Guiliano dead, having an old
quarrel to Francesco Nori, a great friend to the Medici, he killed him into the bargain;
and not satisfied with two murders, he crowded up to Lorenzo with his courage and alacri|ty
to supply what the slackness and cowardice of his accomplices had left unfinished: But
finding him barricado'd in the vestry, he could not come at him. In the midst of this great
tumult, (which was so dreadful it was thought the Church would have been pulled down
upon their heads) the Cardinal got up close to the Altar, where by the labour of the Priests
he was preserved, till the tumult was appeased, and the Senate sent to conduct him to his
own Palace, where he remained in great fear till the time he was dismissed. There were at

that time in Florence, certain Perugians who had been banished from their Houses in
the time of their factions; these Perugians the Pazzi had drawn to their party, by promises
of restitution. So that the Archbishop of Salviati, marching with Gicopo di Poggio and
their followers to secure themselves of the palace, took them along with him; and being
come to the Palace, he left some of his company below, with orders upon the first noise
above stairs that they should seize upon the Gate, whilst he and the rest of the Perugians
went up into the Castle. Finding the Senate was risen (by reason it was late) after a
short time he was met by Cesare Petrucci the Gonfaloniere di Giustitia, so that entring fur|ther
with him, and some few of his crew, he left the rest without, who walking into the
Chancery, by accident shut themselves in, for the lock was so contriv'd, that without the
key, it was not easily to be opened either within or without. The Archbishop being en|tred
with the Gonfaloniere, pretending to impart some great matter to him from the Pope,
he accosted him in so confused and distracted a way, the Gonfaloniere from the disorder both
of his looks and expressions, began to suspect, sprung from him out of the Chamber with
a great cry, and finding Giacopo di Poggio, he caught him by the hair of the head, and de|livered
him to one of the Sergeants. the noise running immediately to the Senators with
such arms as they had about them, they set upon the Conspirators, and all them who went
up with the Archbishop (part being shut up, and part unable to defend themselves) were
either kill'd, or thrown alive out of the windows. Of this number, the Archbishop, the
two other Salviati, and Giacopo di Poggio were hang'd. Those who were left below, had
forc'd the Guards, and Possessed themselves of the Gate; insomuch that the Citizens which
upon the first alarm had run into the Castle, were not able to assist the Senate either with
their counsel or Arms. Francesco de Pazzi in the mean time, and Bernardo Bandini seeing
Lorenzo escaped, and one of themselves (upon whom the hopes of that enterprize
did principally depend) most grievously wounded, they were much dismaid; Bernardo,
concluding all lost, thinking to provide for his safety with the same courage, as he had
injured the Medici, he made his escape. Francesco being returned to his house, tried if he
could get on Horseback (for orders were, as soon as the fact was committed to gallop a|bout
the Town, and excite the People to liberty, and arms) but finding he could not
ride by reason of the deapness of his wound, and the great quantity of blood which he had
lost, he desired Giacopo to do that office for him, and then stripping he threw him|self
upon the bed. Giacopo, though an ancient Man, and not versed in such kind of
tumults, to try the last experiment of his fortune, he got on Horseback,
and with about an hundred Horse well armed, and formerly prepared, he march|ed
towards the Palace, caying out Liberty, liberty, to the People as he went along; but
some of them being deafned by their obligations to the Medici. and the rest not desirous of
any change in the Government, none of them came in. The Senators who were on the top
of the Palace and had secured themselves as well as they could, threw down stones upon
their heads, and frighted them with threats as much as possible. Giacopo was in great con|fusion,
and knew not what to do. when his cousin Giovanni Saristori coming to him, and
reproaching him by what was done already,The Con|spiracy mis|carries. advised him to go home to his house, and be
quiet; assuring him there were other Citizens who would be as careful of the People, and
their liberties as he. Being therefore utterly destitute of all hopes, Lorenzo alive, Fran|cesco
wounded, and no body appearing for him, he resolved to save himself if he could,
and marched out of Florence with his Party at his heels, and went towards Romagna. In
the mean time the whole City was in Arms, and Lorenzo, surrounded by a strong Party of
armed men, was reconveyed to his Palace. The Senats Palace was recovered, and all
those who had possess'd it were either taken or killed. The name of the Medici was with
great acclamation cryed about the City, and the members of those who were slain were ei|ther
dragged or carried upon the point of their swords about the streets; every body with
great anger and cruelty persecuting the Pazzi. Their houses were all broken up by the
People; Francesco, naked as they found him in his bed, was hurried out of his house to the
Palace, and hanged up by the Bishop and his Bretheren, Yet with all their contumely by
the way, and all their affronts when he came there, they could not provoke him to give
them one word; only he looked grim, and fixed his eyes upon every one that abused him,
and without any other complaint, he silently expired, Guglielmo de Pazzi Brother-in-Law
to Lorenzo, was preserved in his house, both out of respect to his innocence,
and the intercession of Bianca his Wife. There was not a Citizen in all the City, but went
either armed or disarmed to Lorenzo in this exigence, and proffered him both them|selves
and their fortunes; so great was the kindness and interest which that family by their
prudence and liberality had gained in the People. Whilst this business happend, Rinato di
Pazzi was retired to his Country house, intending to disguise himself, and and escape if he
could, but he was discovered, apprehended by the way, and brought back again to Flo|rence

Giacopo was taken likewise passing the Alps, for the Alpigines hearing what happen|ed
in Florence, seeing him pass that way, they persued, took him, and returned him
to Florence; nor could he prevail with them (though several time he mades it his earnest
request) to kill him by the way. Four days after this accident, Giacopo and Rinato were
condemned, and put to Death, bt among all who were executed (and they were so ma|ny
that the streets, and high ways were full of their limbs) none was so much lamented as
Rinato; for he was always esteemed an honest good Man, not guilty of that pride and ar|rogance
which was observed in the rest of his family. And that this story might not pass
without an extraordinary instance of the fury of the People, Giacopo who was buried at first
in the Sepulchre of his Fathers, afterwards was torn from thence as an excommunicated
Person, dragged out of the walls of the City, and thrown into a hole; and being taken
up again, his body was drawn (in the same halter with which he was hanged) naked about
the streets, and having no place allowed it to be quiet at land, was at last thrown into the
Arnus. A great example of the inconstancy of fortune, to see a person of his wealth and
authority, pulled so ignominiously in pieces, and ruined with so many circumstances of
contempt. They spake indeed of his vices, and of a strange propensity in him to swearing
and play, above the degree of the most profligate person; but those infirmities were abun|dantly
recompensed in his charity and benificence; for he was a great reliever of the poor,
and endow'd several places of devotion. The Sunday before this plot was to be executed,
that no Man might be a sufferer by any ill fortune of his, he paid all his debts; and all the
effects in his Ware houses or custody which belongeth to other Persons, he consigned to
their several owners with an unimaginable care, after a long examination, Giovan Bat|tista
Montesecco was at last condemned, and his head struck off. Guglielmo de Pazzi, was
banished, and his kinsmen which were left alive, imprisoned in a dungeon in the Castle of
Volterra. When the tumult was over, and the Conspirators executed. Guiliano's fune|ral
was celebrated with the universal condolement of the City, he having been a person of
as much goodness and humanity as could be desired in one of his quality and extraction. He
had only one Son, born some months after his death, who was christned Giulio, who pro|ved
so remarkable for his virtue and fortune, that the whole World rings of his reputation
at this day; and if God gives me life, I shall speak largely of, when I come to the description
of his times.
The forces which were got together under Lorenzo de Castello in the vail of di Tevero, un|der
Giovan Francesco Tolentino in Romagna, in behalf of the Pazzi, were in their march to|wards
Florence: but hearing of the miscarriage of their affairs, they returned from whence
they came, Nevertheless the Pope and the King of Naples (though their Conspiracy had
failed,The Pope and King of Naples make War upon the Florentines. and not produced those mutations which they hoped for in Florence) resolved to
attempt that by open War, which could not otherwise be effected, and both the one and
the other caused their forces to advance towards that City, with all possible diligence, de|claring
as they went, that all the design of their march, and all their desire of the Citi|zens,
was not removing but the removal of Lorenzo, who was the only Enemy he had in the
Town. The King's Army had already passed the Tronto, and the Popes was in the Coun|try
of Perugia; and lest his temporal power should be too little, he let loose his spiritual
maledictions, and excommunications against him. Whereupon the Florentines seeing
themselves invaded with such formidable numbers, addressed themselves to their defence,
with all possible care. Lorenzo de Medici (because the War was pretended only against
him) prest very earnestly that all the chief Citizens might be invited to the Palace before
the Senate; and above 300 of them appearing, he spake to them in this manner.



Most noble Lords, and you must magnificent Citizens.
I do not well know whether I am to congratulate, or condole with you this day for the
things which are passed;Lorenzo's speech to the Florentines. and truly when I consider with what malice and collusion,
I was assaulted, and my Brother slain, I cannot but condole, and my whole heart and
Soul is overwhelmed with the affliction; when after that I revolve with what promptitude,
with what zeal, with what love, with what unanimity, and universal consent of the
whole City, his death was revenged, and mine prevented; I cannot but rejoyce, nay
even triumph and exsult, For as experience has now taught me that I had more Ene|mies
in this City, than I suspected; it has convinced me on the other side, I had more
true friends than I could have hoped for: so that I am to congratulate your goodness, and
to condole the injury and iniquity of other People, which is the more deplorable, be|cause
rare, and underserved. Think, I beseech you, most noble Citizens, to what point
of infelicity fortune hath brought our family, when even among our friends, our relati|ons,

and in the very Church we are in danger. Those who are in distress, or apprehen|sion
of death, are wont to fly to their friends, and relations for shelter; we found ours
not only disposed, but armed, and prepared, and impatient to destroy us. Those who
are under any publick or private persecution, have usually their refuge and Sanctuary in
the Church: where others are protected, we are assaulted: where Parricides and Murderers
are secured, the Medici are murdered themselves. But God (who has not hitherto de|serted
our family) has preserved us, and undertaken our defence. What injury have
we done any body, that could deserve such vehement revenge? Sure we our selves ne|ver
offended those persons who have been so furious against us; if we had, we should not
have left them in that capacity to revenge themselves; if it be publick censure, or injury
which provoked them (and of that too I know nothing) 'tis you, not we are offended;
This Palace, this Senate, and the Majesty of this Government, is aspersed with unde|served
decrees against the Citizens, in partiality to us, which to my own knowledge is
far from being true. We would not have injured them if we had been able, and you
would not have suffered us, had we been willing: who ever traces the truth to the bot|tom,
will find our Family was not exalted by this Government for nothing, if I may speak
it modestly, it was their humanity, their bounty, their munificence which constrained
you to it: if then we have been beneficial to strangers, how came our relations to be dis|gusted?
If their appetite of dominion prompted them to what they have done, (and the
seeing of this Palace. and filling the Piazza with armed Men, is an evident demonstra|tion
it was nothing else) the design is sufficient conviction, and shows their brutality
and ambition. If it were hatred and detestation of our authority, it was you that gave
it us, and it is you were injured. But certainly, if any power or authority deserves to
be regreted, 'tis that which is usurped, not that which is acquired by a continued stream
of kindness and liberality. I appeal to you, most Illustrious Senators, whether any of
my predecessors arrived at their Grandeur any way but by the unanimous consent, and
promotion of this Court, My Grandfather Cosimo returned not from his banishment by
violence, and force of Arms, but by your invitation. My ancient and infirm Father,
was too weak to have supported his authority against so many Enemies; it was your
bounty, it was your authority which defended it. When my Father was dead, and I
(though but a Child) was left to succeed him, Alas! how could I have maintained the
honor and dignity of the Family without your favour and instruction. Our house never
was, nor ever will be able to govern this State, without your cooperation, and
assistance. I cannot imagine therefore what quarrel they should have had against us,
or what just reason for their envy; they should rather have turned their indignation upon
their own ancestors, who with their insolence and avarice defeated them of that honor,
which ours have gained by their generosity and goodness, But, let us gratifie them so
far as to grant we had injured them, and that their combinations against us, were but
reasonable and just; Why must they conspire against this Palace? Why must they confe|derate
with the Pope, and King of Naples, against the innocence and liberty of this
Commonwealth? Why must all Italy be involved in a War? For this they can have no
excuse: if any Man have offended them, they might have offended him again, and not
blended and confounded private injury with publick revenge. This is it which revives
our calamities, though the Authors are extinct. That is it which has brought
the Pope and King of Naples upon us with their Armies, though their declaration be on|ly
against me and my family. I wish to God it were true, and that their design was no
farther: the remedy would be easie, and your deliverance at hand; I should not be so ill
a Citizen as to postpone the publick, to my private security; no I would willingly quench
your flames, though with my own blood and destruction: but because the injuries of
great persons are alway cloathed with some plausible pretence, they have chosen this, to
exasperate you against me: if you think I deserve it, I am now in your hands, to be
continued or rejected as you please: you are my Fathers, you are my Patrons, what e|ver
you command, I will endeavour to do; and not refuse with my own blood to finish
this War, which is begun with my Brothers.



The Citizens could not contain from tears, whilst Lorenzo was speaking, and with the
same pity as they had heard him, he was answered by one deputed by the rest. That the
whole City did acknowledge the merits both of his ancestors and himself. That he should be of
good cheer, for with the same readiness and devotion as they had revenged his Brothers
death, and prevented his, they would preserve his person and reputation, and expose
their whole Country rather than desert him; That their actions might be commensurate,
they appointed him a guard, to secure him against domestick designs, and payed them out
of the publick treasure: after which they addressed themselves to the War, and raised what

Men and mony they were able. They sent for aid to the Duke of Milan, and the Venetians
according to the league; and the Pope more like a Wolf than a Shepherd, being ready
to devour them, they tried all ways to justifie themselves that they could think of, possess'd
all Italy with his treachery against their state, remonstrated his impieties to all the World;
and that he exercised his Papacy with as much injustice, as he gained it: for he had sent
those (whom he had advanced to the highest degree of Prelacy) in the company of Trai|tors
and Murderers to commit treason in the Church, in the time of divine service, and the
Celebration of the Sacrament; and after that (having been unable to kill all the Citizens,
alter the Government, and sack the City) he interdicted it with his Pontifical maledicti|ons,
and threatned to destroy it. But if God were just, and the violences of Men offen|sive
to him; he must needs be displeased at the proceeding of his Vicar, and permit that
Men (having no other refuge) might resort unto him. For which reason the Florentines
not only refuse his interdiction, but forced their Priests to celebrate divine service as be|fore.
They called a Council in Florence, of all the Tuscan Prelats within their jurisdiction,
and appealed to them concerning their differences with the Pope; against which in justifica|tion
of his cause, it was alledged, that it belonged properly to the Pope to supplant Ty|rants,
to suppress ill Men, and to advance good; all which he was to remedy, as oppor|tunity
was offered. But that secular Princes had not right to imprison Cardinals; to exe|cute
Bishops; to kill, or dismember, or drag about the streets the bodies of the Priests;
and to use the innocent and the nocent without any difference or distinction. Nevertheless
the Florentines not at all refusing his quarrels and complaints, dismissed the Cardinal which
was in their power, and sent him back to the Pope; yet the Pope without any regard to
that civility,The Pope and King in|vade the trri|tories of the Florentines. caused them to be invaded with all his forces, and the Kings; both their Ar|mies
(under the Command of Alfonso Duke of Calabria Ferrando's eldest Son, and Fede|rigo
Conted' Urbino) entred Chianti, and by means of the Siennesi, who were of the Ene|mies
party, took Radda; several other Castles; and plundered the whole Country. Next
they encamped before Castellina: the Florentines seeing themselves thus fiercely attacked,
were in great fear, as having but few men of their own, and the assistance of their friends
coming in very slowly; for though the Duke indeed, had sent them supplies, yet the Ve|netians
refused it, as not thinking themselves obliged to relieve them in their particular
quarrels; for as, they pretended, private animosities were not in reason to be defended,
at a publick expence. So that the Florentines, to dispose the Venetian to better things, sent
Tomaso Soderini Embassador to that State, whilst in the mean time, they raised what Men
they could, and made Hercules Marquess of Ferrara their General. Whilst in this man|ner
they were employed in their preparations, the Enemy had brought Castellina to such
distress that, despairing of relief, the Garison surrendered, after forty days siege.
From hence, the Enemy advanced towards Arezzo, and sat down before Monte S. Seni|no.
The Florentine Army was by this time drawn out, and being marched towards the
Enemy, had posted it self within three miles of them, and incommoded them so that
Federigo sent to Urbino to desire a truce for some few days; which was granted, but with
so much disadvantage to the Florentines, that those who requested it were amazed when
they had obtained it; for without it they must have drawn off with disgrace. But having
those days allowed to recollect themselves, when the time was expired they went on with
their siege, and took the Town under the very nose of our Army. By this time Winter
being come, to provide themselves good quarters, the Enemy drew his Army into the
Country of Sienna, the Florentines where they thought most convenient; and the Mar|quess
of Farrara (having done little good to himself or other People) returned from whence
he came. About this time Genoa was in rebellion against the State of Milan, and upon this oc|casion,
Galeazzo being dead,Genoa rebels against the State of Milan. and his Son Giovan Galeazzo a minor, and unfit for the Go|vernment,
difference arose betwixt Sforza, Lodovico, Ottaniano, Ascanio, his Unckles,
and Medona Bona his Mother; each of them pretending to the tuition of the Child. In
which competition Madona Bona the Dutchess Dowager prevailed, by the Counsels of To|maso
Soderini (the Florentine Embassador in that Court, at that time) and Cecco Simo|netto
who had been secretary to the late Galeazzo; whereupon Sforzi flying from Milan,
Ottaniano was drawn, as he was passing the Adda, and the rest dispersed into several
places, Roberto de san Severino ran the same fortune, and fled, having forsaken the Dut|chess
in those disputes, and joyned himself with the Unckles. The troubles falling out, not
long after in Tuscany, those princes hoping from new accidents, or new success, every
one of them attempted what he thought likely to restore him to his Country. King Ferran|do
observing the only refuge the Florentines had in their necessities, was to the State of
Milan. determined to give the Dutchess so much imployment of her own, that she should
not be at leasure to send them any relief; and by means of Prospero Adorno, the Signore

Roberto, and the Sforzi which were banished, he wrought so that Genoa rebelled; never|theless
the little Castle remained firm to the young Duke, and the Dutchess sent forces to
them to recover the Town, but they were overthrown; whereupon considering with her
self the danger which might accrew both to her Son, and her self, if the War should be
continued, all Tuscany being imbroiled. and the Florentines in distress, she resolved, see|ing
she could not retain Genoa as a Subject, that she would have it as a Friend; and a|greed
with Battistino Fregosi (a great Enemy to Prospero Adorno) to deliver him the Castle,
and make him Prince of Genoa, upon condition he would drive out Prospero, and give the
Sforzi no assistance nor protection. After all was concluded betwixt them, the Castle was
surrendered, and by the help of that, and his party, Battistino reducing Genoa, and ac|cording
to their custom, made himself Dogue; the Sforzi and Signore Roberto being forced
out of the Town, they passed with their followers into Lunigiana. The Pope and the
King seeing the troubles in Lombardy composed, took occasion to infest Tuscany on that
side towards Pisa, with those Persons which were driven out of Genoa; supposing by di|viding,
and diverting their forces, to weaken the Florentines; whereupon the Summer
approaching, they prevailed with the Signore Roberto to march with his Squadron from
Lunigiana, into the Country of Pisa; Roberto put the whole Country into confusion; took
several Castles from the Pisans, and plundered them, and made his excursions to the very
walls of Pisa it self. About this time Embassadors arrived at Florence, from the Emperour,
the King of France, and the King of Hungary, who from their several Princes being sent
to the Pope, persuaded the Florentines to send Embassadors also, and promised their ut|most
endeavour with him, to conclude all their differences with an honorable peace. The
Florentines consented, as well to excuse themselves to the World, as that they were really de|sirous
of it. Having sent therefore their Embassadors, they returned as they went, without
any accommodation: and the Florentines finding themselves abused or abandoned by the
Italians, resolved to try if they could gain themselves any reputation by an alliance with
France,The grati|tude of the Fl|rentines. to which purpose they sent as their Embassador Donato Acciaivoli, a person well
skill'd both in the Greek and Latine tongues, whose Ancestors had always born great office
in that State; but being arrived at Milan in his journey he died; and Florence, in honor to
his memory, and remuneration to his Children, buried him magnificently at the publick
charge; gave his Sons considerable exemptions; and his Daughters such portions as would
marry them like themselves; and sent Giud' Antonio Vespucci (a Man well versed in the
imperial and Pontifical Laws) to the King of France in his place. The inroad Signore
Roberto had made into the Country of Pisa, (as all sudden and unexpected things do) gave
the Florentines no little distraction. For the War lying heavy upon them in the Country of
Siena, they could not see how they should be able to defend themselves on the other side;
however they sent officers and all other provisions to reinforce the City of Pisa; and that
they might keep the Lucchesi from assisting the Enemy, with mony or any thing else, they
sent Gino Capponi as their Embassador to them; but he was received so ill, out of an
ancient Enmity to the People of Florence, (upon former injuries received, and a constant
apprehension to them, that he was many times in danger of being killed by the multitude:
So that his journey produced new quarrels, rather than new quiet; and thereupon the Flo|rentines
called back the Marquess of Ferrara, entertained the Marquess of Mantoua into
their pay; and with great importunity, desired of the Venetians Count Carlo the Son of
Braccio, and Deifebo the Son of Count Giacopo, who (after several scruples and demurs)
were sent to them; for having made peace with the Turk, aud no pretence left to excuse
themselves, they were ashamed to braek faith with the League. Carlo therefore, and
Deifebo being come, with a considerable number of Horse, and joyned to what forces
they could conveniently draw out of the Marquess of Ferrara's Army. (which attended the
Duke of Calabria) they marched towards Pisa, in quest of Signore Roberto, who was po|sted
with his ARmy near the river Serchio; and thought at first he made a show of expecting
our Army, yet upon second thoughts he removed. and retired into the Country of Luni|giana,
to the same quarters where he lay before his expedition to Pisa. Upon his depar|ture,
Count Carlo repossess'd himself of all the Enemy had taken in that Country; and the
Florentines being clear on that side; drew all their forces into one body betwixt Colle and
Santo Giminiano; but upon Carlo's conjunction there being several of the Sforzeschi, and
the Bracceschi in the Army, the old feud began to revive, and it was believed, had they
stayed longer together, they had fallen together by the ears: to prevent these inconveni|ences,
it was resolved to divide the Army, that Count Carlo should march with his forces
into the Country of Perugia, and the rest fortifie and intrench themselves at Poggibonzi.
to obstruct the Enemy from entring into the Country of Florence. By this division they
supposed likewise the Enemy would be forced to divide, for they thought that either Count

Carlo would take Perugia (where he had a great party as they believed) or that the Pope
would be constrained to send a good body of Men to defend it; and to drive his Holiness
into greater necessity, they ordered Nicolo Vitelli (who had left Castello, where Lorenzo
his Enemy was predominant) with what force he could make to approach the Town, to
drive out his adversary if he could, and keep it against the Pope.
At first, fortune seemed to encline to the Florentines, Count Carlo advanced strange|ly
in the Country of Perugia; Nicolo Vitelli, though he could not get into the Town of
Castello, yet he was Master of the field, and plundered round about it without any contra|diction;
and those forces which were encamped at Poggibonzi made their excursions to the
very walls of Sienna. But at last all their hopes came to nothing, for first Count Carlo di|ed
in the very height of their expectations, whose death had nevertheless much bettered the
condition of the Florentines, had they known how to have improved the victory which it
produced; for no sooner was the death of Count Carlo known, but the Popes Army (be|ing
all together in Perugia) conceiving great hopes of overpowering the Florentines, took
the field, and encamped upon the Lake within three miles of the Enemy: on the other side
Giacopo Guicciardini, (at that time Commissary of the Army) by the advice of Roberto
da Rimino, (who since the death of Count Carlo, was the chief, and best reputed officer
among them) knowing what it was that set the Enemy agog, they resolved to attend
him; and coming to a Battel not far from the Lake (in the very place where Hannibal
gave the Romans that memorable defeat) the Popes Army was routed.The Popes Army defeat|ed. The news of this
victory was extreamly welcome in Florence, both to the Magistrates, and People; and it
would have been great honor and advantage to that enterprize, had not disorders in the
Army at Poggibonzi spoiled all, and the victory over the one Camp, been interrupted by a
mutiny in the other; for that Army having got much plunder in the Country of Sienna,
when they came to divide, there fell out great difference betwixt the Marquess of Ferrara,
and the Marquess of Mantoa, so that they came to blows, and did one another what mis|chief
they were able.
The Florentines finding no good was to be expected from them together, consented
that the Marquess of Ferrara with his forces might march home; by which means the Army
being weakned, without a head, and very disorderly, the Duke of Calabria being with
his Army not far from Sienna, took a resolution of falling upon them; but the Florentines
hearing of his advance, not trusting to their Arms, their numbers (which was much
greater than the Enemy) nor the situation of their Camp (which were very strong) without
expecting their coming, or seeing so much as the face of their Enemy, as soon as they pre|ceived
the dust, they fled, and left their Amunition, and Carriages, and Artillery behind them;
and so cowardly and poor spirited that Army was become that the turning of a horses head or
tail, gave either victory or defeat. This Rout filled the King's Souldiers with prize, and
the Florentines with fear; for that City was not only afflicted with War, but with so vio|lent
a pestilence, that most of the inhabitants were forced to leave the Town, and betake
themselves to the Country. This overthrow was rendred more terrible by sickness, for
those Citizens who had Estates in the Val di Pisa, and the Val Delsa, being driven thither,
and secure; were forced (upon this rout) to hurry back again to Florence as well as they
could, and that not only with their goods and their Children, but with all their families
and dependants, for every hour they were afraid the Enemy would have presented himself
before the Town. They who had the administration of the War, being sensible of these
disorders, commanded their Army (which was victorious in Perugia) that leaving their
designs there, they should march into the Val Delsa, and oppose themselves against the E|nemy,
who, since their last victory, over-run that whole Country. And though that Ar|my
had so straitned Perugia, it was every hour expected to surrender, yet the Florentines
chose rather to defend themselves, than to gain upon any body else; and raising their siege
they were conducted to S. Cassiano, a Castle about eight miles from Florence, as the only
place where they might lie secure, till the other Army was rallied, and brought to them.
The Enemy on the other side, being at liberty in Perugia, upon the withdrawing of the
Florentines, took heart, and made their inroads daily into the countries of Arezzo and
Cortona; and the other Army, which under the command of the Duke of Calabria, had
routed them at Poggibonzi, took Poggibonzi, and Vico, pillaged Certaldo, made great
spoil, and got great prize in that Country, after they sat down before Colle which (in
those times) was looked upon as extraordinary strong, and being well man'd, and pro|vided
with all things, it was hoped it might entertain the Enemy, till their Armies could
be united.
The Florentines having joyned all their forces at S Cassiano, and the Enemy proceed|ing
very fiercely in their leaguer; they resolved to march towards them, and post them|selves

as near them as they could, supposing they should thereby, not only encourage the
Garison to defend themselves, but make the Enemy more cautious in all his attacks: Here|upon
they removed from S. Cassiano, and encamped at S. Giminiano about five miles from
Colle, from whence with their Horse, and the lightest of their foot, they daily molested
the Dukes Camp: but this was not enough for the Garison in Colle, for wanting all
things that were necessary, they surrendered the 13 of November, to the great displeasure
of the Florentines, but the great joy of the Enemy, especially the Siennesi, who besides
their common hatred to Florence, had a particular quarrel against this Town.
Winter was now at the height; the season unfit for War; and the Pope and King (to
give them hopes of peace, or to enjoy their victory quietly themselves) offered a truce for
three Months to the Florentines, and allowed them ten days for an answer; which proffer
was accepted; but as a wound is more painful when cold, than when 'tis first given, this
small repose, gave the Florentines greater sence of the miseries which they had endured;
insomuch as they began to talk freely, and upbraid one another by the miscarriages in the
War, charging one another with the greatness of the expence, and the inequality of their
taxes, and these exprobrations were not only in the streets, and among the ordinary sort
of People, but even in their conventions, and publick counsels, in which one of them,
took the confidence to tell Lorenzo to his face, that the City was weary, and would have
no more War, and that therefore he should bethink himself of peace; upon which Lorenzo,
discerning the necessity, advised with such of his friends as he judged most faithful and able,
and it was concluded by all (that seeing the Venetians were cold and uncertain; the Duke
young, and imbroiled in new troubles at home) their best way would be to seek out for
new alliance. and try what that would contribute to their success. Their great scruple
was, into whose arms they should cast themselves, whether into the Popes, or the King's
of Naples; and upon serious debate it was resolved into the King's, as a person of more
stability, and likely to yield them better protection, in regard of the shortness of the Popes
lives, and the changes upon their successions. For the small fear the Church has of any
Prince, and the small regard it has of any body else in all its resolutions, causes that no
secular Prince can repose any intire confidence, or communicate freely in his affairs, with
any of the Popes; for the that associats with him in war, and in dangers, may perhaps
have a companion and a sharer in his Victories; but in his distress he shall be sure to be a|lone,
his holiness being still brought off by his speritual influence and authority. It being
therefore determined more profitable to reconcile with the King, there could be no way
thought of so likely, as by Lorenzo himself, for by how much the more that King had ta|sted
of his liberality, by so much the more they thought it probable he might succeed. Lo|renzo
embracing the motion, and having prepared for his journey, committed the City and
Government to Tomaso Soderini (at that time Gonfaloniere di Gustitia) and left Florence
in the beginning of December. Being arrived at Pisa in his way, he writ to the Senate, and
gave them an account of his design, and the Senate in honor to him, and that he might
treat with more reputation, made him Embassador for the People of Florence, and gave
him authority to conclude with him, according to his own judgment, and discretion. A|bout
this time Signore Roberto da Santo Severino, joyning with Lodovico and Ascanio (for
their brother Sforza was dead) they invaded the State of Milan, in hopes to have re-inve|sted
themselves; having possess'd themselves of Tortona, and Milan, and the whole
State being in Arms, the Dutchess was advised (to compose her civil dissentions) to re|store
the Sforzi, and receive them into the Government again. Her great Councellor in
this, was Antonio Tassino a Ferrarese, who, though meanly extracted, being come to Mi|lan,
was preferred to be Chamberlain both to the Duke and the Dutchess; this Antonio,
for the comliness of his person, or some other secret excellence, after the Dukes death,
grew into great favour with the Dutchess, and in a manner governed the whole State;
which was very unpleasing to Cecco,Antonio Tassino a favo|rite of the Dutches. a Man of great prudence, and long experience in pub|lick
affairs, insomuch that he used all his interest both with the Dutchess, and the rest of the
Governors to clip the wings of his authority,  remove him. Antonio having notice of his de|sign,
to countermine him, and have some body near which might be able to defend him, he
advis'd the Dutchess to restore the Sforzi, and the Dutchess following his persuasion, invited
them back again without communicating with Cecco: upon which he is reported to have told
her that she had done a thing which would cost him his life, and deprive her of the Government.
And so afterwards it fell out,Lodovico Sforza Gover|nor of Milan. for Cecco was put to death by Lorenzo, and Tassino turned out of
Milan, which the Dutchess took in such dudgeon, that she forsook the Town, and left
the Government of her Son to his unckle Lodovico, which act of her's in leaving that whole
Dutchy to the Government of Lodovico, was the ruine of Italy, as shall be shown in its
place. Lorenzo de Medici was in his journey towards Naples, and the truce betwixt the

parties, in a very fair way, when on a sudden, beyond all expectation Lodovico Fregoso,
having intelligence in Serezana, surprized the Town, and made all prisoners whom he
found any ways affected to the Florentines. This accident was highly resented by the Go|vernors
of Florence, for they imagined it done by the order of Ferrando, and therefore com|plained
heavily to the Duke of Calabria (who was with his Army at Sienna) that whilst
they were in Treaty, they should be assaulted so treacherously; but the Duke assured them
by Letters, and an Embassy on purpose, that what had passed was done without either
his consent, or his Fathers. However, the affairs of the Florentines were judged in a very
ill condition; their treasure being exhausted; their Prince, in the hands of the King; an
old War on Foot with the Pope and the King, a new War commenced with the Genoeesi,
and no friends to support them, for they had no hopes of the Venetian, and of the State of
Milan they had more reason to be afraid, it was so various and unstable: the only hope re|maining
to the Florentines, was in Lorenzo's address to the King.
Lorenzo arrived at Naples by Sea, was honorably received both by the King, and the
whole City;Lorenzo de Medeci arrives at Niples. and though the War was begun for no other end but to ruine him, yet the
greatness of his Enemies, did but add to his Grandeur; for being brought to his audience,
he delivered himself so handsomly, and discoursed so well of the condition of Italy, of
the humors of all the Princes, and People therein, and gave so good account of what
was to be dreaded by War, and what was to be hoped for by peace, that the King admi|red
the greatness of his mind, the dexterity of his wit, the solidity of his judgment, more
now, than he had wondered before, how he could alone sustain so great an invasion, inso|much
that he doubled his respects towards him, and began to think it his interest much
more to make him his friend, than to continue him his Enemy. Nevertheless upon sun|dry
pretences and fetches, he kept him in dispence from December to March, not only to
satisfie himself in a farther experience of Lorenzo, but to inform himself of the infidelity of
Florence, for that City was not without those who would have been glad the King would
have kept him, and handled him as Giacopo Piccinino was handled. These People began
to complain, and spake ill of him, all over the Town, to oppose themselves publickly in
the Councils against any thing that was moved in favour to Lorenzo; and gave out gene|rally
where ever they came, that if the King kept him much longer at Naples, they would al|ter
the Government; so that the King forbore to dispatch him for some time, in expecta|tion
of a tumult. But finding all quiet, and no likelyhood of any such thing, on the 6 of
March 1479, he dismissed him, having first presented him so nobly, and treated him so
honorably, that they had made a perpetual League, and obliged themselves mutually for
the preservation of one anothers Dominions.
If therefore Lorenzo was great when he went from Florence, he was much greater when
he returned; and was received with a joy, and acclamation in the City, sutable to his
quality, and the recency of his deserts, who had ventred his own life so frankly, to pro|cure
peace to his Country, Two days after his arrival, the Articles of Peace were publi|shed,
by which both the State of Florence and King had particularly obliged themselves to a
common defence; that such Towns as were taken from the Florentines during the War
(if in the King's power) should be restored: that the Pazzi which were prisoners at Vol|terra,
should be discharged, and a certain sum of mony payed to the Duke of Calabria,
for a prefixed time. This Peace was no sooner published, but the Pope, and the Veneti|ans
were infinitly offended, the Pope thinking himself neglected by the King, and the
Venetians by the Florentines, for both one and the other having been partners in the War,
they took it unkindly to be left out of the Peace. Their displeasure being reported and be|lieved
at Florence, it was presently apprehended that the effect of this peace, would be a
greater War.
Hereupon the Governors of the State,New consti|tutions. began to think of contracting the government,
and reducing it into a lesser number of Ministers, appointing a Council of 70 Citizens to
transact such affairs as were of principal importance. This new Constitution settled the
minds of those who were desirous of innovation, and to give it a reputation, the first
thing they did, was to ratifie the peace which Lorenzo had made with the King, and they
appointed Antonio Ridolfi, and Piero Nasi, Embassadors to the Pope. Notwithstanding
this Peace, the Duke of Calabria departed from the Country of Siena with his Army,
pretending he was retained by the dissentions of that City, which were so great, that be|ing
quartered not far off, he was invited into the Town, and their defferences referred to
his arbitration. The Duke accepted the overture, fin'd several of the Citizens; imprisoned
several; banished some, and some he put to death; so that he became suspicious, not only
to the Sienesi, but to the Florentines also; that his design was to make himself Prince
of that City; nor could they devise any remedy, seeing they had entred into a League with

the King, and thereby made both Pope, and Venetians their Enemies. And this suspici|on
was not only got into the brains of the multitude in Florence (a subtile interpreter of
affairs,) but into the minds also of the Governors, so that it was generally concluded, the
liberty of that City was never in more danger: but God who has always had a particular
care of it in all its extremities, averted that evil, and by an unexpected accident, gave
the King, the Pope, and the Venetians a diversion which imported them more, than their
advantages in Tuscany.
Mahomet the great Turk,The Isle of Rhodes assaul|ted by the Turks. was with a great Army, encamped before Rhodes, and had
lien before it several months: though his forces were numerous, and his diligence great,
yet the valour of the besieged was not to be mastered, for they defended themselves so brave|ly,
he was forced to draw off, and quit the siege, with a great deal of dishonor. Ha|ving
left Rhodes, he sent part of his Fleet, under the command of Giacometto Bascia towards
Velona, and (either upon consideration of the easiness of the enterprize; or express com|mand
from the Grand Signore to that purpose) coasting about Italy, on a sudden he lan|ded
6000 Men, assaulted the City of Otranto, took it, plundered it, killed all the Inha|bitants,
and when he had done, fortified both the Town and the harbour as much as possibly
he could, and with a good party of Horse, scowred the whole Country about it. The
King being much alarmed at this invasion, as knowing how great a Monarch he had to
deal with, sent his Embassadors about to every Body, to let them know his condition, and
to beg their assistance, against the common Enemy; besides which he pressed the Duke of
Calabria with all imaginable importunity, to leave his designs at Siena, and come back with
all his forces: this invasion though it was very dreadful to the Duke, and all the rest of I|taly,
yet it was welcome to Florence and Siena, the one thinking its liberty most miracu|lously
preserved, and the other themselves as strangely delivered from those dangers which
would of necessity have destroyed them. Which opinion was much encreased by the un|willingness
wherewith the Duke departed from Siena; complaining and cursing his fortune,
which by so unreasonable and an unexpected accident, had defeated him of the Domini|on
of Tuscany. The same thing, changed the Counsels of the Pope, and whereas before
he would never admit any Embassador from Florence, he was grown now so meek, he
would hear any body speak of a general Peace; and word was sent to the Florentines that
when ever they found themselves enclined, ask pardon of the Pope, they would be sure to
have it. The Florentines thought not fit to slip so fair an occasion; and therefore sent 12
Embassadors to the Pope, who entertained them with diverse practices after they were
arrived at Rome, before he admitted them to audience: yet at length it was adjusted how
all Parties should comport for the future, and what every one should contribute, in time of
Peace, as well as in War; after which the Embassadors were admitted to the feet of the
Pope, who was placed in great Pomp, with his Cardinals about him.
The Embassadors,The Embas|sadors to the Pope. to extenuate what had passed, laid the fault sometimes upon their
own necessities; sometimes upon the malignity of other People: sometimes upon the popu|lar
fury; sometimes upon their own just indignation; as being so unhappy to be forced ei|ther
to fight; or to die; and because death is the most terrible of all things, and all things
will be tried, before that will be embraced, they had endured the War, the excommuni|cations
and all the ill consequences which followed; rather than suffer their liberty (which is
the life of a Commonwealth) to be taken from them, and extinguished: nevertheless, if
their necessity had run them upon the rocks, and forced them to do any thing which was
displeasing to him, they were ready to make him satisfaction, and did hope, according to
the example of their gracious Redeemer, he would be as ready to receive them into his
most merciful Arms.The Pope replies. To which excuses his Holiness replyed with great heat and indignation,
reproaching them by all the mischiefs which they had done to the Church; nevertheless, to
preserve the Commandments of God, he was contented to grant them their pardon as
they desired; but intimated withal, that they were to be more obedient for the future, and
if again they transgressed, that liberty which now they were only like to have lost
should be then taken wholly, and that justly, away, because they who deserved to be free,
were such as practised good things, and not bad; and liberty abused, was destructive both
to themselves, and other People; for to neglect their duty either to God or his Church,
was not the office of good Men, but of such as were dissolute and lewd; the correction of
which belongeth not only to Princes, but to all that are Christians; so that for what was to be
passed, they were to lay the fault upon themselves; who by their ill deeds had given occa|sion
of the War, and continued it by their worse; but now that was at an end, yet it was
attributed more to the goodness of other People, than any merit in them; after which he
gave them his benediction and the form of the agreement, to which he had added (besides
what had been debated, and concluded on in Counsel,) that if the Florentines expected any

fruit from his blessing, they should furnish out fifteen Gallies and keep them in their pay
till the Turk was beaten out of Italy. The Embassadors complained grievously to have an
article of that weight superadded to what was concluded in the Treaty; but by all the
friends they could make, and all the arts they could use, they could not prevail to have it
expunged; whereupon returning to Florence, that Senate, to perfect the Peace, sent
Guid Antonio Vespucci (who not long before was returned from France) their Embassador
to his Holiness, and by his prudence, he brought the terms to be tolerable, and as a grea|ter
sign of his reconciliation, received several other marks of his Holiness favour. The
Florentines having put an end to all their differences with the Pope. Siena being free, they
delivered from their apprehensions of the King, by the Duke of Calabria drawing away
with his Army out of Tuscany, and the War continuing with the Turks, they pressed the
King so hard to the restitution of such places as the Duke of Calabria at his departure had
committed to the keeping of the Sanesi; that he began to fear the Florentines might desert
him, and by making War upon the Sanesi; hinder the assistance which he expected from
the Pope, and the rest of the Princes of Italy; whereupon he caused them all to be delive|red,
and by several new favours, reobliged the Florentines to him; from whence we
may observe, that it is interest and necessity, not their hands or their words, which make
Princes keep their promises. These Castles being restored, and the new League confir|med,
Lorenzo de Medici gained greater reputation than the War first, and after, the peace
(when they were jealous of the King) had taken from him. For at that time there wan|ted
not those who calumniated him openly, as one, who to preserve himself, had sold his
Country, and as by the War they had lost their Towns, by the peace they should lose their
liberty. But when the Towns were restored; and honorable peace concluded with the
King; and the City returned to its ancient reputation, the People (who are generally
greedy to talk, and judge of things more by the success, than the Counsel) changed their
note presently, and cryed up Lorenzo to the skies, as one who had gained more by his
management in that peace, than their ill fortune had got them by the War; and that his
prudence and judgment had done what all the Armies and power of their Enemies could
not.
This descent of the Turks defer'd the War, which the Pope and the Venetians upon pro|vocation
of that peace, had designed against them, but as the beginning of the Turkish in|vasion
was unexpected, and produced much good; so the end of it was unlooked for, and
the occasion of much mischief; for Mahomet the Grand Signore died suddenly, and diffe|rence
arising betwixt his Sons, those who were landed in Puglia, being abandoned by their
Lord, came to an agreement with the King of Naples, and delivered up Otranto into his
hands. This fear therefore being removed, which kept the Pope, and the Venetians qui|et;
every one began to be apprehensive of new troubles. On the one side the Pope and the
Venetian were in League, and with them Genoesi, Sanesi, and other lesser Potentates. On
the other side, were the Florentines, the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and
with them the Bolognesi, and several other little States. The Venetian had a design upon
Ferrara; they thought they had reason enough to attempt it, and hopes enough to carry
it. The reason was, because the Marquess had declared himself obliged no longer to re|ceive
either their Visdomine, or their falt; for by compact after 70 years, that City was to
be exempt both from the one and the other: to which the Venetians replyed that so long as
he retained the Polesine; so long he was, to receive the Visdomine and the Salt; but
the Marquess refusing; they thought they had just occasion to take Arms, and their oppor|tunity
was convenient, seeing the Pope, in such indignation, both against the Florentines,
and King: to oblige him the more, Count Girolamo being by accident at Venice, was ho|norably
treated, made a Gentleman of that City, and had all the priviledges and immunities
of a Citizen conferred upon him; which is a particular favour, and shows always the great
esteem they bear to the Person which receives it. In preparation for this War, they laid
new taxes upon their subjects; and for their General, they had chosen Roberto da San Se|verino,
who upon some difference betwixt him, and Lodovick Duke of Milan, fled to Tor|tona,
and having made some tumults there, he got off to Genoa, from whence he was in|vited
by the Venetians, and made General of their Army. The news of these preparati|ons
coming to the ears of the League, they prepared themselves accordingly. The Duke
of Milan chose Federigo Lord of Urbin, for his General. The Florentines Costanzo di Pe|saro;
and to sound the Pope, and discover whether these proceedings of the Venetians were
by his consent, King Ferrando sent the Duke of Calabria with his Army to quarter upon
the Tronto, and desired leave of his Holiness that they might pass thorow his territories, from
thence into Lombardy to the relief of the Marquess; which being absolutely denied, the Flo|rentines
and King thinking that a sufficient declaration of his mind, resolved to attempt it

by force, and try if that they could make him their friend, or at least give him such
impediments as should hinder his supplying of the Venetians, who had already taken the
field; invaded the Marquess; overrun most of the Country, and clap'd down with their
Army before Figarolo, a Castle of great importance to the affairs of that Prince. The
King and the Florentines having in the mean time concluded to fall upon the Pope, Alfon|so
Duke of Calabria marched his Army towards Rome, and by the help of the Collennesi
(who were joyned with him, in opposition to the Orsini who sided with the Pope) he com|mitted
great spoils all over that Country. On the other side, the Florentines under the
command of Nicolo Vitelli assaulted the City of Castello; took it, turned out Lorenzo who
had kept it for the Pope, and gave it to Nicolo as Prince: the Pope was at this time in ve|ry
great anxiety. Rome was full of factions within, and the Enemy in the Country with|out.
Nevertheless, (like a couragious Prince, resolved to overcome, not to yield to his
Enemies) he entertained for his General Roberto da Rimino, and inviting him to Rome,
where he had assembled all the forces he could make, he represented how great an honor it
would be to him, if he could rescue the Church from the calamities which were upon it;
and that not only himself and his successors, but God Almighty would reward him. Roberto
having taken a view of his Army, and all the Magazines, he persuaded the Pope to raise him
what foot he could more, which was done with great diligence and expedition. The
Duke of Calabria was all this while forraging about that Country, and making his inroads
to the very walls of the City; which netled and provoked the Citizens so, as many of them
came freely, and offered their service to remove them, which Roberto with many thanks,
and great expressions of kindness accepted.
The Duke, understanding their preparations, thought fit to draw farther off from the
City, supposing that Roberto would not venture to follow him at any distance from the
Town; besides he had some expectation of his Brother Federigo who was to come to him
with fresh supplies from his Father. Roberto finding himself equal in Horse, and superior
in foot, drew his Army out of the Town, and directing towards the Enemy, he encam|ped
within two miles of him. The Duke finding the Enemy upon his back, quite contra|ry
to his expectation; perceived there was no remedy but he must fight, or run away; so
that forced, and constrained, lest otherwise he should do a thing unworthy of a King's Son,
he resolved to fight, turned upon the Enemy, and each of them having put their Army
into order, according to the discipline of those times, they fell to it, and the battle conti|nued
from morning to noon, and was fought with more courage than any in Italy for fif|ty
years before; there dying on the one side and the other above a thousand Men: the end
of which fight was very honorable for the Church; for their infantry being numerous, so
galled the Dukes Horse,The Duk of Calabria de|feated. that they were forced to turn tail; and the Duke had been taken,
had he not been rescued by some Turks, which upon the delivery of Otronto took pay un|der
him. Roberto having gained so absolute a Victory, returned triumphantly to Rome;
but he enjoyed the pleasure of it but little, for in the heat of the battle having drunk a great
quantity of cold water, he put himself into a flux, and died not many days after; his body
being interred by his Holiness with all imaginable ceremony. The Pope having gained
this Victory, he sent the Count towards Castello to try if he could recover it for Lorenzo, and
what he could do upon Rimina; for after the death of Robert, there being only one Child left
in the tuition of his Lady, he thought it might be no hard matter to get into that Town;
and doubtless he had succeeded, had not that Lady been assisted by the Florentines, who
opposed him so happily, that he could do nothing against Rimino, nor Castello. Whilst
these things were in agitation in Romagna, and Rome, the Venetians had taken Figarolo,
and passed the Po with their Army; the Duke of Milan's, and the Marquess his Army (be|ing
in no small disorder, upon the death of the Count d' Urbino) who falling ill was re|moved
to Bologna; and died there; so that the Marquesses affairs began to decline, and
the Venetians had great hopes of becoming Masters of Ferrara. On the other side the Flo|rentines
and King of Naples, used all possible art to bring the Pope over to their party, but
not being able to do it by force; they threatned him with a Counsel, which the Empe|rour
had pronounced already should be held at Basil. Whereupon, by persuasion of his
Embassadors at Rome and the chief of the Cardinals (who were very desirous of peace) the
Pope was constrained,A new League. and began to hearken to the peace, and tranquillity of Italy; and
for fear the Grandeur of the Venetians should be the ruine of that Country, he became in|clinable
to the League, and sent his Nuncii to Naples, where a peace was concluded for five
years betwixt the Pope, King of Naples, and Florentines, reserving a certain time for the
Venetians, if they pleased to come in. Which being done, the Pope sent to the Veneti|ans
to desist in their War against Ferrara, but the Venetians were so far from complying,
they reinforced their Army, and pursued it with more cagerness than before; for having

defeated the Dukes forces, and the Marquesses at Argenta, they had advanced in such man|ner
against the City, that their Army was encamped in the Marquesses Park. So that the
League, thinking it no dallying any longer, resolved to assault them with all the forces they
could make, and accordingly the Duke of Calabria had orders to march thither with their
Army. The Florentines likewise sent what Men they could spare; and for the better ad|ministration
of the War, a Diet was appointed to be held at Cremona, where there met the
Popes Legat, Count Girolamo, the Duke of Calabria, the Signore Lodovico, and Lorenzo de
Medici, with many other Princes of Italy, in which Council the Method of the future War
was debated, and having concluded that Ferrara could not any way be relieved more effe|ctually,
than by a brisk diversion, they desired Lodovico's permission to attack the Veneti|ans
thorow the Country of Milan; but Lodovico would not be persuaded, as fearing to pull
a War upon his back, which he could not be rid off when he pleased: whereupon it was de|termined
that they should march with their whole strength for Ferrara, and having mu|stered
4000 Horse and 8000 Foot, they advanced against the Venetians, who were 2200
Horse, and 6000 Foot. But the first thing the League thought fit to attempt, was a Fleet
which the Venetians had upon the Po: and they assaulted it so smartly that they broke it at
Rondino, destroyed 200 of their Vessels, and took Antonio Iustiniano (the Proveditor of
their Navy) Prisoner.
The Venetians seeing all Italy combined against them; to give themselves greater reputa|tion,
they entertained the Duke of Reno into their pay with 200 good Horse and upon news
of the defeat of their Fleet, they sent him with part of the Army to face the enemy, whilst
Roberto da San Severino passed the Adda with the rest, and approaching to Milan, pro|claimed
the Duke and Madam Bona his Mother; hoping that Lodovico and his Government
had been so odious in that City, that the very name of the other would have begot some
commotion. This inroad at first produced some kind of terror: but the conclusion was
quite contrary to what the Venetians had designed, for this compelled Lodovico to do, what
he could not be brought to before; and therefore leaving the Marquess of Ferrara to the de|fence
of his own Country, with 4000 Horse, and 2000 Foot, the Duke of Calabria with
12000 Horse, and 5000 Foot, marched into the Countries of Bergona, Brescia, and Vero|na,
plundering and spoiling all about them, before the Venetians could send them any re|lief,
for Roberto and his Army had much ado to secure that City: on the other side, the
Marquess of Ferrara, had recovered a great part of his losses; for the Duke of Reno (who
was sent to confront him) having but 2000 Horse and 1000 Foot was not able to oppose
him: so that all that year 1483, things went on prosperously for the League. The next
Spring (the Winter having passed without any considerable action) both Armies took
the field. The League, for greater expedition in their designs against the Venetians, had
drawn their whole Army together; and (had the War been managed as wisely as the
year before) had easily carried what ever the Venetians were possess'd of in Lombardy; for
they were reduced to 6000 Horse, and 5000 Foot (whilst the Enemy consisted of 13000
Horse, and 6000 Foot) for the Duke of Reno, being entertained only for a year, when
his time was out, was retired. But (as it many times happens where many are in equal
authority) diffention among the Grandees, gives the Victory to the Enemy; for Federigo
Gonzagua Marquess of Mantona being dead (who whilst he was living, kept the Duke of
Calabria, and Signore Lodovico in good correspondence) there grew exceptions betwixt
them, and jealousies by degrees: for Giovan Galeazzo being of age, become capable of the
Government, and married to the Daughter of the Duke of Calabria, he had a mind his
Son-in-Law, and not Lodovico, should exercise the Government. Lodovico, smelling his de|sign,
resolved if possible, to prevent him. This inclination of Lodovico's, being known
to the Venetians, they thought it a fair opportunity to gain (as they had done before) by
peace; what by Wur they had lost; and making private overtures to him, in August 1484
they came to an agreement, which was no sooner divulged but the other Confederuts were
highly displeased, especially seeing all they had taken from the Venetians would be restored;
the Venetians lefvin the possession of Rovigo and Polisine (which they had taken from the
Marquess of Ferrara) and invested with all the Prerogatives and preheminences which they
had exercised over that City before for every Man judged they had made a chargeable War;
gained some honor indeed in the prosecution of it; but in the conclusion, they had come off
with disgrace; for the Towns which they had taken were restored, but the Towns they had
lost were kept by the Enemy: yet the confederats were glad to accept the Peace, being weary
of the war,Castello be|sieged by the Army of the Pope. and unwilling to attempt their fortune any further with the defects and ambi|tion
of other People.
Whilst in Lombardy things were managed at this rate, the Pope, by the mediation of
Lorenzo, pressed hard upon the City of Castello to turn out Nicolo Vitelli, who (to bring

over the Pope to their party) was deserted by the League. Whilst they were intrenched be|fore
the Town, those of the Garison who were friends to Vitelli, sallyed out upon the Ene|my,
and beat them from the siege; hereupon the Pope recalled Girolamo from Lombardy;
caused him to come to Rome to recruit his Army, and then sent him to pursue his designs a|gainst
Castello: but judging it better upon second thoughts to reduce Nicolo by fair means
than foul, he made peace with him, and reconciled him, as much as in him lay, to his
adversary Lorenzo: and to this he was constrained more out of apprehension of new trou|bles,
than any desire to peace; for he saw ill humours remaining betwixt the Colonnesi,
and the Ursini.
In the War betwixt the Pope and the King of Naples, the King of Naples had taken
from the Ursini the Country of Pagliacozzo, and given it to the Colonnesi who followed his
party. When Peace was afterwards made betwixt the Pope and the King, the Ursini de|manded
restitution by virtue of that treaty.The Colonni provoked the Pope, and are ruin'd in Rome. The Pope many times required the Colonnesi
to deliver it, but neither the prayers of the one, nor the threats of the other being able to
prevail, they fell upon the Ursini with their old way of depredation and plunder. The
Pope not enduring that insolence, drew all his forces together, and joyning them with
the Ursini, they sacked the Houses of all the Colonni in Rome; killed those who resisted, and
destroyed most of the Castles which they had in those parts: so that those tumults were en|ded,
not by peace, but by the destruction of one of the parties.
In the mean time, the affairs in Genoa and Tuscany were in no better condition; for the
Florentines kept Antonio da Marciano, with his forces upon the frontiers of Serezana,
and with excursions and skirmishes, kept the Serezani in perpetual alarm. In Genoa Bat|tistino
Fregoso Doge of that City, reposing too much confidence in Paulo Fregoso the Arch-Bishop,
was himself, his Wife and Children, seized by him, and the Archbishop
made himself Prince. The Venetian fleet had at that time assaulted the King of Naples;
possess'd themselves of Galipoli; and alarmed all the Towns about it; but upon the peace in
Lombardy, all the differences were composed, except those in Tuscany, and Rome: for
the Pope died five days after the Peace was proclaimed, either his time being then come, or
else his indignation at the Peace (against which he was most obstinately averse) having
killed him. However he left all Italy quiet when he died, though whilst he lived, he
kept it constantly imbroiled. Upon his death, Rome was immediatly in Arms: Count
Girolamo with his forces retired to the Castle: the Ursini were fearful the Colonni would re|venge
the injuries they had so lately received: the Colonni demanded their Houses and Ca|stles
to be made good; so that in a few days, Murders, Roberies, and burning of Houses, was
to be seen in several parts of the City; but the Cardinals having persuaded Girolamo to de|liver
up the Castle into the hands of their Colledge; to retire to his own Government, and
free the City from his forces; hoping thereby to make the next Pope his friend, he readi|ly
obeyed, delivered up the Castle to the Colledge, and drew off his forces to Imola. So
that the Cardinals being rid of that fear, and the Barons of the assistance they expected
from Girolamo, they proceeded to the Election of a new Pope, and after some little dis|putes,
they made choice of Giovan Battista Cibo Cardinal di Malfetta, a Genoese, with the
name of Innocent the 8, who by the easiness of his Nature (being a Man of peace) pre|vailed
with them to lay down their Arms, and once more made all quiet at Rome.
Notwithstanding this Peace, the Florentines could not be prevailed with to be quiet;
it appearing to them dishonorable, and insufferable, that a private Gentleman should have
taken, and keep from them the Castle of Serazana; and because it was an article in the
Peace, that not only all that had been lost might be demanded again, but that War might
be waged against any that obstructed it, they prepared Men and mony to go on with that
enterprize: whereupon Agostino Fregoso, who had surprized Serazana, finding himself un|able
with his private force, to sustain such a War, he resigned it to S. George. And see|ing
we shall many times have occasion to mention S. George, and the Genoesi,The Compa|ny of S. Gior|gio. it will not
be inconvenient to describe the orders and methods of that City, which is one of the prin|cipal
in Italy.
When the Genoesi had made peace with the Venetians, after the greatest War in which
they had ever been engaged, not being able to satisfie certain Citizens who had advanced
great sums of money for the service of the publick, they made over to them the profits of the
Dogana, appointing that every Man should share of them, according to the proportion of
his principal sum, till his whole debt should be wrought out; and for their convenience of
meeting, and better disposing of their affairs, they consigned the Palace to them which
was over the Custom-house. These Creditors erected a kind of Government among them|selves,
created a Counsel of 100 to deliberate and order all publick matters, and another of
eight Citizens, to put them in execution: their debts were divided into several parts, which

they called Luoghi, and their whole body was called San. Giorgia. Having established their
Government in this manner, new exigences arising every day to the Commonwealth, they
had recourse to San. Giorgio for supplies; which being rich, and well managed was able al|ways
to relieve them: but the Magistrates and community of the City (having granted
them their customs before) were forced now when they borrowed any mony, to make o|ver
their lands to them, and they had done it so frequently, that the necessities of the one,
and the supplies of the other had brought things to that pass, that the greatest part of the
Towns and Cities under the jurisdiction of Genoa, were fallen into their hands, and they
Governed and disposed of them as they pleased, chusing annually their Rettori or Gover|nors
by publick suffrage, without the least interposition or concernment of the Common|wealth.
From hence it happened that the affection of the People was removed from the
Government of the Commonwealth (which they looked upon as tyrannical) to the Go|vernment
of San Giorgio, (which was well, and impartially administred) and from hence
the casic and often changes, of the State did proceed; which submitted it self sometimes
to this Citizen, sometimes to that stranger, as occasion invited; and the reason was, be|cause
it was not San. Giorgio, but the Magistrats which altered the Government. There|fore
when the contention was betwixt the Fregosi, and Adorni for Soveraignty of the City;
because the controversie was only among the Governors of the Commonwealth; the grea|test
part of the Citizens withdrew, and left the State to him that could catch it; the office
of San. Giorgio concerning it self no farther, than to swear the person advanced, to the con|servation
of their Laws, which have not been altered to this very day; for having Arms,
and mony, and conduct, they cannot be subverted without danger of a destructive Re|bellion.
A rare and incomparable example, not to be fellowed in all the visible, or im|maginary
Commonwealths of the Philosophers; to behold in the same Circle, among the
same Citizens, liberty, and tyranny, civility, and corruption, justice, and rapine to be
exercised at the same time; for that order alone preserved that City in its ancient and venc|rable
customs. And had it fallen out (as in time doubtless it will) that the Govern|ment
of the Commonwealth had fallen to the management of San. Giorgio, no question but
before this it would have been greater, and more formidable than the republick of Venice.
To this San. Giorgio, therefore Agostino Fregosa (not being able to keep it himself) delive|red
Serezana: San. Giorgio accepted it readily, undertook to defend it; put out a Fleet
immediatly to Sea; and sent forces to Pietra Santa to intercept any that should go to the
Florentines, who were already encamped before Serezana. The Florentines on the other
side had a months mind to Pietra Santa, as a Town which, by reason of its situation be|twixt
Pisa and that, would make Serezana inconsiderable, though they should take it;
and in the mean time interrupt them in their Leaguer, as often as that Garison should
think it fit to come forth. To bring this about, the Florentines sent a considerable quanti|ty
of provisions and amunition, with a small party to convey them from Pisa to their
Camp. Supposing that the Garison of Pietra Santa would be tempted to take them, both
from the weakness of the convoy, and the greatness of the prize: and their artifice succeed|ed,
for the Garison could not see such a booty, and suffer it to pass. This was as the Flo|rentines
desired, and gave them just pretence of hostility; whereupon, rising from Sereza|na,
they marched to Pietra Santa, and encamped before it, which being well man'd, de|fended
it self stoutly. The Florentines having disposed their artillery in the plain, they
raised a new battery upon the mountain, intending likewise to batter it from thence. Gi|acopo
Guicardini was their Commissary at that time, and whilst they were employed at Pi|etra
Santa in this manner, the Genoa fleet took and burned the Rocca di Vada, and land|ing
some Men, overran all the Country there abouts. Against these forces Bongiami Gian|figliazza
was dispatched with a party of Horse and foot, who restrained their extravagance,
so as they did not make their excursions as formerly. However the Fleet continued to mo|left
the Florentines, and accordingly removed to Ligorn, where with bridges, and other
military engines, having got close to the New Tower, they battered it smartly for several
days together, but finding it to no purpose, they went off again with shame. In the mean
time the siege at Pietra Santa went on very slowly; insomuch that the Enemy was encou|raged,
to attempt upon their battery, and sallying out when they saw their advantage, they
carried it, much to their own reputation, and to the discouragement of their Enemy, who
immediatly drew off to about four miles distance, and the officers considering it was Octo|ber,
and the Winter fr on, were of opinion to put their Army into their quarters, and
reserve the prosecution of their siege, till a better season.
These disorders being known at Florence, filled all the chief officers with great indigna|tion;
upon which to recruit their Camp, and recover their reputation, they elected An|tonio
Pucci, and Bernardo del Nero for their new Comissaries; who being sent with a consi|siderable

supply of mony to the Camp, remonstrated to the chief officers, the displeasure of
the Senate, the State and the whole City; their commands to return their Leaguer with
the Army; the scandal and infamy it would be, if so many great officers, with so great
an Army, having nothing to oppose them but a pitiful Garison, should not be able to
carry so weak, and so contemptible a Town. They represented likewise, the present and
future advantage which they might expect if it were taken; so that they were all encou|raged
to return, and the first thing to be attacked, they resolved should be the Bastion, out
of which they had been forced: in which action, it was manifest, what courtesie, affabili|ty,
kind usage, and good words could produce in the Souldiers, for Antonio Pucci, per|suading
this, promising that, assisting a third with his hand, and embracing the fourth,
incited them to the assault with such fury, that they regained the Bastion in a moment; but
they did not take it without loss, for the Count Antonio da Marciano was slain from one of
their great Guns. This success brought such a terror upon the Garison, that they be|gan
to think of surrendring.Pietra Santa taken by Lo|renzo. That things might be transacted with greater reputation, Lo|renzo
de Medici thought good to repair in person to the Camp, where he was no sooner ar|rived,
but in a few days the Castle surrendered. Winter being come, it did not appear
to those Officers convenient to prosecute the War, but to attend better weather, for the
season of the year, by the malignity of the air had infected the Army extreamly, for ma|ny
of their chief Officers were sick; and among the rest, Antonio Pucci, and Bongianni
Gianfigliazzi, were not only sick, but died, to the great regret of all People, so much
honor and estimation had Antonio, acquired by his conduct at Pietra Santa. The Flo|rentine
had no sooner taken, and settled themselves in Pietra Santa, but Embassa|dors
came to them from the Lucchesi to demand it, as an appendix to their Commonwealth;
alledging that among the rest, there was an express article that what ever should be taken
either of the one side or the other, should be restored to the first owners. The Florentines
did not deny the agreement, but answered that they could not tell whether in the Peace
they were then negotiating with the Genoeses, they might not be obliged to restore it, and
therefore they could give them no positive resolution, till that was determined; and if
it should happen that they should not be obliged, it would be necessary for the Sienesi to
think of some way to satisfie for the expence they had been at, and the damage they had
received by the loss of so many considerable Citizens, and when they did so, they might
be consident they should have it. This whole Winter was consumed, in negotiations of
Peace, betwixt the Florentines and the Genoesi, which were transacted at Rome by
the mediation of the Pope: but nothing being concluded, the Florentines would have
fallen upon Serezana in the spring, had they not been prevented by Lorenzo's indisposition,
and a new War betwixt Ferrando and the Pope. For Lorenzo was not only troubled with
the Gout (which was his hereditary disease) but he had so great pains and affliction at his sto|mach,
that he was forced to go to the baths to be cured. But the chiefest occasion was
the War, which was originally from hence. The City of Aquila was subject to the King|dom
of Naples, but so, as in a manner it was free. In that City, the Count de Morto|rio
was a Man of more than ordinary reputation. The Duke of Calabria lying with his
Horse not far from Tronto, pretending a desire to compose certain tumults which had hap|pened
betwixt the Peasants in those parts (but being really ambitious to reduce that City
to a more intire subjection to his Father) sent to the Count to let him know he desired to
speak with him, and take his advice in the regulation of those affairs. The Count, not
having the least jealousie, repaired to him immediatly, but he was seized, as soon as he
arrived, and sent Prisoner to Naples.
This accident being known in Aquila, altered the affections of the whole City,Aquila re|bels against the King of Na|ples. inso|much
that the People taking Arms, Antonio Concinello (the King's Commissary) was slain,
and with him, such of the Citizens as were known to be affected to the Neapolitan interest:
and that they might have friends to defend them in their Rebellion, they set up the Ban|ner
of the Church, and sent Embassadors to the Pope, to tender him the possession of their
City, and implore his protection against the Tyranny of the King. The Pope was easily
persuaded to their defence, as a Person that hated the King, both upon publick,The Pope undertakes its protection. and
private accounts; whereupon being informed that Roberto da San Severino (a great Ene|my
to the State of Milan) was out of imployment, he sent for him to Rome with all speed,
made him his General, and solicited all the friends and relations of the Count de Mortorio
to rise in his behalf; so that the Princes of Altemura, Salerno, and Besignana took up
Arms against the King. The King seeing himself engaged so unexpectedly in a War, sent
to the Florentines, and Duke of Milan for their aid; the Florentines were very irresolute
what was to be done; they thought it unreasonable, to leave their own designs, for the
promotion of other Peoples, besides that, the taking up Arms again so suddenly against the
Church, must needs be very dangerous; nevertheless being in League, and under an obli|gation,

they prefer'd their faith before either interest, or danger; took the Orsini into their pay,
and sent their whole force (under the Count de Pitigliano) towards Rome, in assistance
of the King. By this means the King had two Camps, that under the Duke of Calabria,
he sent towards Rome, in conjunction with the Florentines, to attend the motion of the
Army of the Church; the other he kept at home, to secure his own Country against any
commotion by the Barons, and in both places things occurred with variety of success: but
at length the King remaining in all places superior, by the mediation of Embassadors from
Spain, in August 1486 a Peace was concluded, to which the Pope (being depress'd, and
discouraged with his ill fortune) consented, and all the Princes of Italy with him, only
the Genoesi were excepted,Peace con|cluded. as Rebels to the State of Milan, and usurpers upon the terri|tories
of Florence. The Peace being concluded, Roberto da San. Severino, having been nei|ther
faithful to the Pope, nor terrible to the Enemy, was turned out of Rome in disgrace,
and being pursued by the forces of the Florentines and the Duke; when he was past Cesen|na,
finding they gained upon him, and would be presently upon his back, he betook him|self
to his heels, and with about 100 Horse fled away to Ravenna, leaving the rest of his
party either to be entertained by the Duke, or destroyed by the Country. The King ha|ving
signed the Peace, and reconciled himself with his Barons, he caused Giovanni Coppo|la,
and Antonello d' Anversa and their Sons, to be put to Death, as Persons who had be|trayed
his secrets to the Pope in the time of the War. By the experiment of this War, the
Pope having observed with what diligence and alacrity the Florentines preserve their alli|ance,
though he hated them before for their affection to the Genoesi, and their asistance to the
King, he began now to caress them, and show greater favour to their Embassadors, than for|merly
he had done: which inclination being intimated to Lorenzo, he improved it with all
possible industry, as knowing it would gain him great reputation, if to his friendship with
the King, he could add the amity of the Pope. This Pope had a Son called Francesco, and
being desirous to advance him both in fortune and friends (which when he was dead might
support him) he could not find a Person in all Italy, with whom he might more safely ally
him, than with Lorenzo de Medici; and therefore he ordered things so that he married
him to a daughter of Lorenzo's. This alliance being finished, his Holiness had a desire
that the Genoesi by agreement should deliver up Serezana to the Florentines, and declared
to them that they could not in justice retain what Agostino had sold them; nor could Agosti|no
convey that to San. Giorgio which was none of his own; but with all his arguments he
could never prevail; so that whilst these things were in agitation in Rome, the Genesi
went on with their preparations, and rigging out many of their Ships, before they could
have any news of it at Florence, they landed 3000 Men, and assaulted the Castle of Sere|zanello,
which stands upon the Serezana and was Garisoned by the Florentines, and ha|ving
sacked, and burned the Town (which lies on one side of it) they advanced against
the Castle, and having planted their Guns, they battered it exceedingly. This attack
was new, and unexpected to the Florentines, insomuch that they drew what force they
were able together, under the command of Urginio Ursino, at Pisa, and made their com|plaints
to the Pope, that whilst he was in treaty with them for peace, the Genoeses had
invaded them; after which they sent Piero Corsini to Lucca, to preserve that City in its al|legiance:
they sent likewise Pagocantonio Soderini their Embassador to Venice, to try the
minds of that Commonwealth. They desired aid likewise of the King of Naples, and
Signor Lodovico, but neither of them supplied them, the King pretending apprehension of
the Turkish fleet; and Lodovico with other shifts delaied to relieve them; so that the Flo|rentines
(as they usually are) were left alone in their necessity, finding no body so well
disposed to assist them, as they were to assist other People. Nevertheless (being not strange
to them) they were not at all discouraged, but raising a great Army under the Command
of Giacopo Guicciardini, and Pietro Vettori, they sent them against the Enemy, who had
lodged himself upon the River Magra. In the mean time Serazanello was closely besiged,
and what with mines, and batteries, brought to great danger of being taken. Whereupon a
Counsel being called, it was resolved to leave it, and the Enemy not at all declining, they
came to an engagement,The Genoeses overthrown. in which the Genoesi were defeated, Lodovico dal Fiesco, and se|veral
of their principal officers taken Prisoners: yet this Victory could not encline the Sere|zanesi
to surrender, they rather prepared more obstinately for their defence; and the Floren|tine
Commissaries being as diligent on their side, it was couragiously both assaulted and de|fended.
This Leaguer proving longer than was expected, Lorenzs de Medici thought it
expedient to go himself to the Camp, where his arrival animated his own Souldiers, and
discouraged the adversary; for upon observation of the vigour of the Florentines, and the
coldness of their supplies from Genoa, freely, without any capitulation, they threw
themselves into the arms of Lorenzo, and (except some few who were more eminently

active in the Rebellion) they were all courteously treated by the Florentines. During this
siege, Signor Lodovico, had sent his Horse to Pontremoli, in appearance, in our favour;
but holding a correspondence in Genoa, a party mutinied against the Government and by
the help of those forces, secured the Town for the Duke of Milan. About this time, the
Germans made War upon the Venetians and Boccelino d' Osimo Nella Marca, had caused
Osimo to revolt from the Pope, and made himself Lord of it. This Boccelino, after many
accidents was contented (upon the persuasion of Lorenzo di Medici) to deliver up that
Town again to the Pope, which he did, and coming to Florance, he lived there (under
Lorenzo's protection) very honorable, a considerable time; but afterwards removing to
Milan, and not finding the same faith as he had done at Florance, he ws put to death by
Lodovico's command. The Venetians, being set upon by the Germans near the City of
Trento were utterly defeated,The Veneti|ans defeated. and Signor Roberto da San Severino their General was slain.
After the loss of this Victory according to their usual fortune, the Venetians made a peace
with the Germans, but upon terms as exceedingly honorable, as if they had been the
Conquerors.
About the same time great troubles arose likewise in Romagna: Francesco d' Orso of Fur|li;
was a Man of great authority in that City, and falling under the suspicion of the Count
Girolamo, he was many times threatned by him: so that Francesco living in perpetual fear
he was advised by his friends and relations, to be before hand with the Count, and seeing
his intention was manifestly to take away his life, he should strike the first blow and make
sure of the Count, and so by the death of another Person, secure himself. This Counsel
begin given, and as resolutely undertaken, they appointed the time to be at the Fair at Fur|li;
for several of their friends in the Country coming to the Town on course that day, they
thought they should have enough of them present, without the danger of inviting them.
It was in the month of May, in which the greatest part of the Italians have a custom of
supping by day light. The Conspirators thought their best time to kill him would be af|ter
he had supped, when the servants were gone down to their own, and left him as it
were alone in his Chamber. Having agreed upon the time, Francesco went to the Counts
Palace, and having left his accomplices below, and told one of his Servants that he desired
to speak with the Count, he was admitted, and finding him alone, after some previous
and pretended discourse,Count Giro|lamo murdered. he took his opportunity and killed him; then calling up his Com|panions,
the Servant was slain likewise; and then the Captain of the Castle coming in by
accident with some few in his company to speak with the Count, they fell upon him, and mur|dered
him with the rest. Having finished their work, and raised a great hubub in the
House, the Count's body was thrown out of the window, a great cry made of liberty and
the Church, and the people exhorted to Arm, who abominating the cruelty and the ava|rice
of the Count, fell upon his Houses, plundered them, and made the Countess Catheri|na
(his Lady) and her Family Prisoners: and this was done with so little opposition,
that there was nothing but the Castle which hindered the accomplishment of their designs:
but that Captain being obstinate, and not to be wrought upon by them to surrender, they
desired the Countess to try if she could persuade him, which she promised to endeavour, if
they would let her go to him into the Castle; and as Hostage for her fidelity, she would
leave them her Children. The Conspirators believed her, and gave her leave to go to him;
but she was no sooner in the Castle, but she began to swagger, and threaten them with
death in revenge of her husband's; and when they told her they would kill all her Chil|dren,
she bid them do their worst, for she knew how to have more. The Conspirators
were not a little dismaid at this accident; they saw the Pope sent them no succours, and
hearing that Lodovico the Countesses Unckle was sending forces to her relief, they pack'd
up what they could, and away they went to Castello so that the Countess being restored,
she revenged the death of her husband with all possible cruelty.The Coun|tess revenged the Death of her Husband. The Florentines had news of
what happened to the Count, and immediatly took occasion to attempt the Castle of Pian|caldoli
which had been formerly taken from them by the said Count; and accordingly send|ing
their forces thither, they retook it, but with the death of Ciecco, a most excellent
Architect. About the same time that this tumult happened in the City, another of no less
importance, fell out in the Country of Romagna Galeotto Lord of Faenza, was married to
the Daughter of Giovanni Bentivogli Prince of Bologna: this Lady being jealous, or upon
some other ill usage from her husband; or else ill natur'd of her self, had her Husband in
such contempt, that she contrived to take away both his Authority and Life; and one day
counterfeiting her self sick, she laid her self upon the bed, and having hid some of her Co|merads
in her Chamber; she ordered when Galeotto came to visit her, they should rush up|on
him, and kill him. This Lady had communicated her design to her Father, who was
well enough contented, hoping when his Son-in-Law was dead he might set up for him|self.

The time agreed upon for the Execution being come, Galeotto as he was accusto|med)
came to see his Wife,Galeotto Lord of Faenza mur|dered by his Wife. and having discoursed with her a while, the Conspirators
rushed forth, and killed him before he could make any defence. Upon his death a great
tumult was raised, and the Lady with one of her little Children called Astorre was forced to
betake herself to the Castle, The people took arms; Giovan Bentivogli (with a Berga|mese
who had been an officer under the Duke of Milan) having got some forces together
marched into Faenza where Antonio Boscoli the Commissary of Florence was resident at that
time, and having assembled all the chief of that party, they were in great argument about
the Government of the Town; when the inhabitants of the Val di Lamona, had taken the
alarm, and being got together in a throng, they fell upon Giovami, and the Bergamese,
they cut one of them to pieces, and took the other prisoner, and calling out upon Astorre, and
the Florentines, they delivered the City to the conduct of the Commissary. This accident
being known in Florence, was highly displeasing to every Body; nevertheless they caused
Giovanni and his Daughter to be set at liberty, and took upon themselves the care of Astor|re
and the City, by univeral consent of the whole People. After the Wars betwixt the
greater Princes were composed; besides these, there happened many tumults in Romagna
la Marca, and Siena, which being of no great moment, I think it supperfluous to recount
them. True it is, troubles in Siena (after the end of the War, and the Duke of Cala|bria's
leaving those parts in the year 1488) were more frequent than else where, and
after several variations (sometimes the people, sometimes the Nobility having the predo|minance)
at length the Nobility prevail'd, and of them, the persons of greatest authori|ty
were Pandolfo, and Giacopo Petrucci, who, one of them for his conduct and the other
for his courage, were made as it were Princes of that City; But the Florentines from the
end of the War against Serazana to the year 1492 (in which Lorenzo died) lived in great
felicity. For Lorenzo having by his great interest and prudence, procured peace all over
Italy,Lorenzo de Medici. he applied himself to enlarging the Grandeur of the City, and of his own Family;
and first he married his eldest Son Piero, to Alfonsina the Daughter of Cavaliere Orsimo: his
second Son Giovanni he advanced to be a Cardinal, which having no president, was the
more remarkable; for he was but 13 years old, at the time of his promotion: for his third
Son Giuliano (who was very young) he could make no extraordinary provision, because
he lived not long after: but his Daughters were disposed of very well: one of them was
married to Giacopo Salvati, another to Francesco Cibo; a third to Piero Ridolfi, the fourth
(which he had married to Giovanni de Medici to keep his Family united) died. In his
private affairs, especially in merchandizing, he was very unfortunate, for by reason of
the exorbitance of his officers (who all of them lived like Princes) much of his fortune
was wasted and squandered, insomuch that he was constrained to be beholding to the State
for great sums of mony. That he might be no longer lyable to the malignity of fortune, he
left his trading, and fell a purchasing land, as a surer, and more durable way. In the
Countries of Prato, Pisa, and the vale, he bought such possessions, as for the revenue,
and magnificence of the Houses, were fitter for a King than a private person. After this
he beautified and enlarged the City, and because there were many places uninhabited, he
appointed new streets, and caused new houses to be erected to fill them; which was not
only an augmentation, but a great Ornament to the City. That he might live quietly at
home, and in time of War, keep his Enemies at a distance, he fortified the Castle of Fire|zuolo,
which stands towards Bologna in the middle of the Alps. Towards Siena, he be|gan
to repair Poggio Imperial, and make it very strong: towards Genoa, he secured that
passage, by the reducation of Pietra Santa, and Serezana; with good stipends and Pensi|ons
he confirmed his friends, the Baglioni in Perugia, the Vitelli in the City of Castello: in
Faenza he had a particular Government, all which were as so many Bulwarks to keep the
Enemy from Florence. In times of peace he caressed the City with feasting, and plays,
and tournaments, and representations of ancient triumphs, to delight and entertain the
People: his only design being to see them pleased, the City suppplied, and the Nobles re|spected:
he was a great lover of Artists, and favourer of learned Men, of which Agnola
da montepulciano, Christofano Laudini, and Demetrius the Greek can give ample testimo|ny:
the Count Giovanni della Mirandola (a person almost defied for his literature) left
all the other parts of Europe which he had travelled, and (moved by Lorenzo's magni|ficence)
fixt his residence at Florence. In Architecture, Musick, and Poesy, he delight|ed
exceedingly. Many poetical compositions with several of his comments upon them
are still to be seen. And that the Florentine youth might be encouraged to study, he ere|cted
an University in Pisa, and hired the best Scholars in Italy to read to them: he built a
Monastery not far from Florence on purpose for Frier Mariano da Chinazano an Augu|stine
Monk, and one which he esteemed an excellent Preacher. He was greatly beloved

both of God, and fortune, for all his designs came to a good end, and all his Enemies mis|carried;
for besides the Pazzi, he was set upon to have been killed by Battista Frescobaldi,
in the Carmine; and by Baldinotto da Pistoia, at his Country House; but both of them fail|ed,
and were justly punished, with all their confederats. The excellence of his conversation,
the eminence of his wisdom, and the happiness of his fortune, made him honorable not on|ly
in Italy, but in all the Courts of the world. Mathias King of Hungary gave many te|stimonies
of his affection: the Soldan by his Embassadors and presents, visited and presen|ted
him. The great Turk delivered Bernar do Bandini into his hands, who had murdered
his Brother Giulian; all which rendered him highly venerable in Italy, and he added to his
reputation every day by his prudence. In his discourse he was eloquent, and facetious; in
his resolutions wise, in his executions, quick, and couragious; nor can any think be ob|jected
sufficient to eclipse these virtues, though he was indeed addicted to Women, took
too much pleasure in the company of witty and satyrical Men; and would play at boys play
sometimes beneath the dignity of his office; for he would play many times with his Chil|dren
at all the most idle and Childish recreations they would put him to. So that if the
gravity of his life, be considered with its levity, he will seem to be composed of two seve|ral
persons, united by an almost impossible conjunction. The last part of his days was full
of sorrow and disquiet, occasioned by the distempers of his body; for he was sorely affli|cted
with intolerable pains at his Stomack,Lorenzo died which brought him so low, that in April
1492 he died, in the 43 year of his age. Never was there any man, not only in Florence
but Italy, who departed with more reputation for his wisdom nor more lamentation to
his Country; and because upon his death, many desolations were like to ensue, the Hea|vens
themselves did seem to presage it. The spire of the Church of S. Riparata was struck
with thunder with such fury that a great part of the steeple was destroyed by it to the great
consternation of the City. All the Inhabitants of Florence, and the Princes of Italy, be|wailed
him, which was particulary manifested by their several compliments of condolen|cy,
and whether they had reson or not, for what they did, the effects which succeeded a
while after, did clearly demonstrate; for being deprived of his Counsels, Italy could not
find one remaining, able to satiate, or restrain the ambition of Lodovico Duke of Milan,
for want of which, after his death such seeds of dissention brake forth, as have perplexed
and embroiled all Italy ever since.

NICOLO MACHIAVELLI
TO THE
Most Illustrious LORENZO Son of
PIERO de MEDICI.
THose who desire the favour of a Prince, do commonly intro|duce
themselves by presenting him with such things as he
either values much, or does more than ordinarily delight
in; for which reason he is frequently presented with Horses, Arms,
Cloath of Gold, Iewels, and such Ornaments as are sutable to his
Quality and Grandeur. Being ambitious to present my self to your
Highness with some testimony of my devotions towards you, in all my
Wardrobe I could not find any thing more precious (at least to my
self) than the knowledge of the Conduct and Atchievements of Great
Men, which I learn'd by long conversation in modern affairs, and a
continual investigation of old: after long and diligent examinati|on,
having reduced all into a small Volume, I do presume to present
to your Highness; and though I cannot think it a work fit to appear
in your presence, yet my confidence in your bounty is such, I hope it
may be accepted, considering I was not capable of more, than pre|senting
you with a faculty of understanding in a short time, what
for several years, with ininite labour and hazard I had been ga|thering
together. Nor have I beautified or adorned it with Rheto|rical
Ornations, or such outward imbellishments as are usual in such
descriptions. I had rather it should pass without any approbation,
than owe it to any thing but the truth and gravity of the matter. I
would not have it imputed to me as presumption, if an inferior per|son
as I am, pretend not only to treat of, but to prescribe, and regulate
the proceedings of Princes: for as they who take the Landskip of a
Country, to consider the Mountains, and the nature of the higher
places, do descend ordinarily into the Plains, and dispose themselves
upon the Hills, to take the prospect of the Valleys; in like manner,
to understand the nature of the people, it is necessary to be a Prince,
and to know the nature of Princes, 'tis as requisit to be of the people.
May your Highness then accept this Book with as much kindness as
it is presented; and if you please diligently and deliberately to re|slect
upon it, you will find in it my extreme desire that your High|ness
may arrive at that Grandeur which Fortune and your Accom|plishments
do seem to presage; from which pinacle of Honour, if your
Highness vouchsafes at any time to look down upon things below,
you will see how unjustly, and how continually I have been exposed
to the malignity of fortune.






Machiavel's Prince.

CHAP. I.
The several sorts of Governments, and after what
manner they are obtained.
_THere never was, nor is at this day any Government in the World, by
which one Man has rule and dominion over another, but it is either
a Commonwealth, or a Monarchy. Monarchies are either heredi|tary,
where the ancestors of the Soveraign have been a long time in
possession, or where they are but new. The new are either so
wholly, and entirely (as Milan was to Francis Sforza) or annex'd
to the hereditary Dominions of the Conquerour (as the Kingdom
of Naples, to the Kingdom of Spain.) These territories thus acqui|red
are accustomed either to be subject to some Prince, or to live at liberty and free, and
are subdued, either by his auxiliaries, or own forces, by his good fortune, or conduct.


CHAP. II.
Of Hereditary Principalities.
I Shall omit speaking of Commonwealths, as having discoursed of them largely elsewhere,
and write in this place only of Principalities, and how according to the foregoing divi|sion,
the said Principalities may be governed, and maintained. I do affirm then that he|reditary
States, and such as have been accustomed to the Family of their Prince, are pre|served with less difficulty than the new, and because it is sufficient not to transgress the ex|amples
of their predecessors, and next to comply and frame themselves to the accidents that
occur. So that if the Prince be a person of competent industry, he will be sure to keep
himself in the throne, unless he be supplanted by some great, and more than ordinary force:
and even then, when so supplanted, fortune can never turn tail, or be adverse to the
usurper, but he will stand fair to be restored. Of this, Italy affords us an example in the
Duke of Ferrara, who supported bravely against the invasion of the Venetians in 1484, and
afterwards against Pope Iulius 10, upon no other foundation but his antiquity in that
Government; for a natural Prince has not so much occasion or necessity to oppress his Sub|jects,
whereby it follows he must be better beloved, and retain more of the affections of
his People unless some extraordinary vices concur to make him odious, so that the successi|on
and coherence of his Government, takes away the causes and memory of innovations;
for one new change leaves always (as in buildings) a toothing, and aptitude of ano|ther.



CHAP. III.
Of mixt Principalities.
BUt the difficulties consist in Governments lately acquired, especially if not absolutely
new, but as members annexed to the territories of the Usurper, in which case such a
Government is called mixed. The tumults and revolutions in such Monarchies proceed
from a natural crosness and difficulty in all new conquests, for Men do easily part with their
Prince, upon hopes of bettering their condition, and that hope provokes them to rebel,
bt most commonly they are mistaken, and experience tells them their condition is much
worse.
This proceeds from another natural and ordinary cause necessitating the new Prince to
overlay or disgust his new subjects by quartring his Army upon them, Taxes, or a thou|sand
other inconveniences, which are the perpetual consequents of conquest. So that you
make them your Enemies who suffer, and are injured by your usurpation, but cannot pre|serve
their friendship who introduced you, because you are neither able to satisfy their ex|pectation,
or imploy strong remedies against them, by reason of your obligations, where|fore
though an usurper be never so strong, and his Army never so numerous, he must have
intelligence with the natives, if he means to conquer a Province. For these reasons Lewis
XII. of France, quickly subdued Milan, and lost it as quickly, for the same People which
open'd him their gates, finding themselves deceived in their hopes, and disappointed in
the future benefits which they expected, could not brook, nor comport with the haughti|ness
of their new Soveraign: 'tis very true, Countries that have rebelled, and are conquered
the second time, are recovered with more difficulty, for the defection of the People having
taken off all obligation or respect from the Usurper, he takes more liberty to secure himself
by punishing offenders, exposing the suspected, and fortifying where ever he finds him|self
weak; so that Count Lodovick having been able to rescue Milan out of the hands of the
French the first time, only by harrasing and infesting its borders, the second time he reco|vered
it, it was necessary for him, to arm and confederate the whole World against the
said King, and that his Army should be beaten, and driven out of Italy: and this happe|ned
from the foresaid occasions. Nevertheless the French were twice dispossess'd. The
general reasons of the first, we have already discoursed; it remains now that we take a pro|spect
of the second, and declare what remedies the said King Lewis had, or what another
may have in his condition, to preserve himself better in his new conquests, than the King
of France did before him. I say then that Provinces newly acquir'd, and joyn'd to the ancient
territory of him who conquer'd them, are either of the same Country, or Language, or
otherwise. In the first case, they are easily kept, especially if the People have not been too
much accustomed to liberty: and to secure the possession, there needs no more than to extir|pate
the Family of the Prince which governed before; for in other things maintaining to
them their old condition, there being no discrepancy in their customs, Men do acquiesce and
live quietly, as has been seen in the cases of Burgundy, Bretagne, Gascogne and Normandy,
which have continued so long under the Goverment of France: for though there be some
difference in their language, nevertheless their Laws and customs being alike, they do ea|sily
consist. He therefore who acquires any thing, and desires to preserve it, is obliged
to have a care of two things more particulary; one is, that the Family of the former Prince
be extinguished; the other, that no new Laws or Taxes be imposed; whereby it will come to
pass, that in a short time it may be annexed and consolidated with his old Principality.
But where Conquest is made in a Country differing in Language, Customs, and Laws,
there is the great difficulty, their good fortune and great industry is requisit to keep it; and
one of the best and most efficacious expedients to do it, would be for the Usurper to live
there himself, which would render his possession more secure, and durable, as the great
Turk has done in Greece, who, in despight of all his practices and policies to keep it in
subjection, had he not fixed his Imperial residence there, would never have been able to
have effected it. For being present in Person, disorders are discovered in the bud, and
prevented; but being at a distance, in some remote part, they come only by hear-say, and
that, when they are got to a head, and commonly incurable. Besides, the Province is not
subject to be pillaged by officers, by reason of the nearness and accessibleness of their Prince,
which disposes those to love him who are good, and those to dread him who are other|wise;
and if any foreigner attacks it, he must do it with more care and circumspection,
in respect that the Princes residence being there, it will be harder for him to lose it.

There is another Remedy, rather better than worse, and that is, to plant Colonies in
one or two places, which may be as it were the Keys of that State, and either that must be
done of necessity, or an Army of Horse and Foot be maintained in those parts, which is
much worse; for Colonies are of no great expence; The Prince sends and maintains them
at very little charge, and intrenches only upon such as he is constrain'd to dispossess of their
Houses and Land, for the subsistance and accommodation of the new Inhabitants, who are
but few, and a small part of the State; they also who are injur'd and offended, living
dispers'd and in poverty, cannot do any mischief, and the rest being quiet and undisturb'd,
will not stir, lest they should mistake, and run themselves into the same condition with
their Neighbours.
I conclude likewise, That those Colonies which are least chargeable, are most faithful
and inoffensive, and those few who are offended are too poor, and dispers'd, to do any
hurt, as I said before; And it is to be observ'd, Men are either to be flatter'd and indulged,
or utterly destroy'd; because for small offences they do usually revenge themselves, but for
great ones they cannot; so that injury is to be done in such a manner, as not to fear any
revenge. But if in stead of Colonies, an Army be kept on foot, it will be much more
expensive, and the whole revenue of that Province being consum'd in the keeping it, the
acquisition will be a loss, and rather a prejudice than otherwise, by removing the Camp up
and down the Country, and changing their quarters, which is an inconvenience every
man will resent, and be ready to revenge, and they are the most dangerous and implacable
Enemies who are provok'd by insolences committed against them in their own houses. In
all respects therefore, this kind of guard is unprofitable, whereas on the other side Colo|nies
are useful. Moreover, he who is in a Province of a different constitution (as is said
before) ought to make himself head, and Protector of his inferior Neighbours, and endea|vour
with all diligence to weaken and debilitate such as are more powerful, and to have a
particular care that no stranger enters into the said Province, with as much power as he;
for it will always happen that some body or other will be invited by the Male-contents, either
out of ambition, or fear. This is visible in the Etolians, who brought the Romans into
Greece, who were never admitted into any Province, but by the temptation of the Natives.
The Common method in such Cases is this; As soon as a foreign Potentate enters into a
Province, those who are weaker, or disoblig'd, joyn themselves with him, out of emulation
and animosity to those who are above them, insomuch that in respect of these inferiour
Lords, no pains is to be omitted that may gain them; and when gain'd, they will readily
and unanimously fall into one mass with the State that is conquered. Only the Conqueror
is to take special care they grow not too strong, nor be intrusted with too much Authority,
and then he can easily with his own forces, and their assistance keep down the greatness of
his Neighbours, and make himself absolute Arbiter in that Province. And he who acts not
this part prudently, shall quickly lose what he has got, and even whil'st he enjoys it, be
obnoxious to many troubles and inconveniences. The Romans in their new Conquests ob|serv'd
this Course, they planted their Colonies, entertain'd the inferior Lords into their
protection without increasing their power, they kept under such as were more potent, and
would not suffer any foreign Prince to have interest among them. I will set down only
Greece for an Example. The Etolians, and Achaians were protected; the Kingdom of
the Macedonians was depress'd, and Antiochus driven out; yet the merits and fidelity of the
Achaians and Etolians could never procure them any increase of Authority, nor the persua|sions
and applications of Philip induce the Romans to be his friends, till he was overcome,
nor the power of Antiochus prevail with them to consent that he should retain any Sove|raignty
in that Province: For the Romans acted in that case as all wise Princes ought to do,
who are to have an eye, not only upon present, but future incommodities, and to redress
them with all possible industry, for dangers that are seen afar off, are easily prevented, but
protracting till they are at hand, the remedies grow unseasonable, and the malady incura|ble.
And it falls out in this case, as the Physitians say of an Hectick Feaver; that at first it
is easily cur'd, and hard to be known, but in process of time, no being observ'd, or resisted
in the beginning, it becomes easie to be known, but very difficult to be cur'd: So is it in
matters of State, things which are discover'd at a distance (which is done only by prudent
men) produce little mischief, but what is easily averted: But when thorow ignorance or
inadvertency, they come to that height that every one discerns them, there is no room for
any remedy, and the disease is incurable: The Romans therefore foreseeing their troubles
afar off, oppos'd themselves in time, and never swallow'd any injury, to put off a War, for
they knew that War was not avoided, but defer'd thereby, and commonly with advantage
to the Enemy; wherefore they chose rather to make War upon Philip, and Antiochus in
Greece, than suffer them to invade Italy; and yet at that time there was no necessity of either,

they might have avoided them both, but they thought it not fit; for they could never relish
the saying that is so frequent in the Mouths of our new Politicians, To enjoy the present benefits
of time, but prefer'd the exercise of their courage and wisdom, for time carries all things
along with it, and may bring good as well as evil, and ill as well as good. But let us return
to France, and examine if what was there done, was conformable to what is prescribed
here: and to this purpose I shall not speak of Charles VIII. but of Lewis XII. as of a Prince
whose Conduct, and affairs (by reason his possession was longer in Italy) were more con|spicuous,
and you shall see how contrary he acted in every thing that was necessary for the
keeping of so different a State. This Lewis was invited into Italy by the Venetians, who had
an ambition to have got half Lombardy by his coming: I will not condemn the Expedition,
nor blame the Counsels of that King, for being desirous of footing in Italy, and having no
Allies left in that Country but all doors shut against him (upon the ill treatment which
his predecessor Charles had used towards them) he was constrain'd to take his friends
where he could find them, and that resolution would have been lucky enough, had he not
miscarried in his other administration; for he had no sooner subdued Lombardy, but he
recover'd all the reputation and dignity that was lost by King Charles: Genoa submitted;
Florence courted his friendship, the Marquess of Mantoua, the Duke of Ferrara, Bentivoglio,
Madam de Furli, the Lords of Faenza, Pesoro, Rimini, Camerino, Piombino; the Lucchesi,
Pisani, Sanesi, all of them address themselves to him for his alliance and amity; Then the
Venetians began to consider, and reflect upon their indiscretion; who to gain two Towns
in Lombardy, had made the King of France Master of two thirds of all Italy. Let any one
now think with how little difficulty the said King might have kept up his reputation in that
Country, if he had observ'd the rules abovesaid, and protected his friends, who being nu|merous,
and yet weak, and fearful, (some of the Pope, and some of the Venetians) were
always under a necessity of standing by him, and with their assistance he might easily have
secured himself against any Competitor whatever. But he was no sooner in Milan, but he
began to prevaricate and send supplies to Pope Alexander, to put him in possession of Ro|magna,
not considering that thereby he weakned himself, and disoblig'd his friends who had
thrown themselves into his arms, and agrandized the Church, by adding to its spiritual au|thority
(which was so formidable before) so great a proportion of temporal, and having
committed one error, he was forc'd to proceed so far, as to put a stop to the ambition of
Pope Alexander, and hinder his making himself Master of Tuscany, the said Lewis was
forced into Italy again. Nor was it enough for him to have advanced the interest of the
Church, and deserted his friends, but out of an ardent desire to the Kingdom of Naples,
he shared it with the King of Spain; so that whereas before he was sole Umpire in Italy,
he now entertained a Partner, to whom the ambitious of that Province, and his own Male-contents
might repair upon occasion; and whereas the King of that Kingdom might have
been made his Pensioner, he turn'd out him, to put in another that might be able to turn
out himself.
It is very obvious, and no more than Natural, for Princes to desire to extend their
Dominion, and when they attempt nothing but what they are able to atcheive, they are
applauded, at least not upbraided thereby; but when they are unable to compass it, and
yet will be doing, then they are condemned, and indeed not unworthily.
If France then with its own forces alone had been able to have enterpriz'd upon Naples,
it ought to have been done; but if her own private strength was too weak, it ought not to
have been divided: and if the division of Lombardy to which she consented with the
Venetian, was excusable; it was, because done to get footing in Italy; But this partition
of Naples with the King of Spain, is extreamly to be condemned, because not press'd or
quicken'd by such necessity as the former. Lewis therefore committed five faults in this Ex|pedition:
He ruin'd the inferior Lords; He augmented the Dominion of a Neighbour Prince;
He call'd in a Forreigner as puissant as himself; He neglected to continue there in person;
and planted no Colonies: All which errors might have been no inconvenience whil'st he
had lived, had he not been guilty of a sixt, and that was depressing the power of the Vene|tian:
If indeed he had not sided with the Church, nor brought the Spaniards into Italy, it
had been but reasonable for him to have taken down the pride of the Venetian, but persuing
his first resolutions, he ought not to have suffer'd them to be ruin'd, because whil'st the
Venetian strength was intire, they would have kept off other people from attempting upon
Lombardy, to which the Venetians would never have consented, unless upon condition it
might have been deliver'd to them, and the others would not in probability have forced it
from France, to have given it to them: and to have contended with them both, no body
would have had the courage. If it be urg'd that King Lewis gave up Romagna to the Pope,
and the Kingdom of Naples, to the King of Spain, to evade a War, I answer, as before,

That a present mischief is not to be suffer'd to prevent a War, for the War is not averted,
but protracted, and will follow with greater disadvantage.
If the Kings faith and engagements to the Pope to undertake this enterprize for him, be
objected, and that he did it to recompence the dissolution of his Marriage, and the Cap
which at his intercession his Holiness had confer'd upon the Legate of Amboise, I refer them
for an answer, to what I shall say hereafter about the faith of a Prince, how far it obliges.
So then King Lewis lost Lombardy, because he did not observe one of those rules, which
others have followed with success in the Conquest of Provinces, and in their desire to keep
them: Nor is it an extraordinary thing, but what happens every day, and not without
reason. To this purpose I remember I was once in discourse with the Cardinal d' Amboise
at Nantes, at the time when Valentino (for so Caesar Borgia Pope Alezander's Son was
commonly call'd) possess'd himself of Romagna: In the heat of our Conference the Car|dinal
telling me that the Italians were ignorant of the art of War; I replyed, that the French
had as little skill in matters of State, for if they had had the least policy in the world, they
would never have suffer'd the Church to have come to that height and Elevation. And it
has been found since by experience, that the Grandeur of the Church and the Spaniard in
Italy, is derived from France, and that they in requital, have been the ruine and expulsion
of the French.
From hence a general rule may be deduc'd, and such a one as seldom or never is subject
to Exception. Viz. That whoever is the occasion of anothers advancement, is the cause of
his own diminution: because that advancement is founded either upon the conduct or power
of the Donor, either of which become suspicious at length to the person prefer'd.


CHAP. IV.
Why the Kingdom of Darius usurped by Alexander, did not rebel against
his Successors, after Alexander was dead.
THE difficulties encountred in the keeping of a new Conquest being consider'd, it may
well be admired how it came to pass that Alexander the Great, having in a few years
made himself Master of Asia, and died as soon as he had done, That state could be kept from
Rebellion: Yet his Successors enjoy'd it a long time peaceably, without any troubles or con|cussions
but what sprung from their own avarice and ambition. I answer, That all Monar|chies
of which we have any record, were govern'd after two several manners; Either by a
Prince and his Servants whom he vouchsafes out of his meer grace to constitute his Mini|sters,
and admits of their Assistance in the Government of his Kingdom; or else by a
Prince and his Barons who were persons advanc'd to that quality, not by favour or concession
of the Prince, but by the ancientness, and Nobility of their Extraction. These Barons
have their proper jurisdictions and subjects, who own their Authority, and pay them a
natural respect. Those States which are govern'd by the Prince and his Servants, have their
Prince more Arbitrary and absolute, because his Supremacy is acknowledged by every bo|dy,
and if another be obeyed, it is only as his Minister and Substitute, without any affection
to the Man. Examples of these different Governments, we may find in our time in the per|sons
of the Grand Signore, and the King of France. The whole Turkish Monarchy is
governed by a single person, the rest are but his Servants, and Slaves; for distinguishing his
whole Monarchy into Provinces and Governments, (which they call Sangiacchi) he sends
when and what Officers he thinks fit, and changes them as he pleases. But the King of
France is established in the middle (as it were) of several great Lords, whose Soveraignty
having been owned, and families beloved a long time by their Subjects, they keep their pre|heminence,
nor is it in the King's power to deprive them, without inevitable danger to
himself. He therefore who considers the one with the other, will find the Turkish Empire
harder to be subdued, but when once conquered, more easie to be kept: The reason of the
difficulty is, because the Usurper cannot be call'd in by the Grandees of the Empire; nor
hope any assistance from the great Officers, to facilitate his Enterprize, which proceeds from
the reasons abovesaid, for being all slaves, and under obligation, they are not easily cor|rupted;
and if they could, little good was to be expected from them, being unable for the
aforesaid reasons, to bring them any party: So that whoever invades the Turk, must expect
to ind him entire and united, and is to depend more upon his own proper force, than any
disorders among them; but having once conquered them, and beaten their Army beyond the
possibility of a recruit, the danger is at an end; for there is no body remaining to be afraid

of, but the Family of the Emperor, which being once extinguished, no body else has any
interest with the people, and they are as little to be apprehended after the Victory, as they
were to be relyed upon before. But in Kingdoms that are governed according to the Model
of France, it happens quite contrary, because having gained some of the Barons, to your side
(and some of them will always be discontent, and desirous of change) you may readily
enter: They can (as I said before) give you easie admission, and contribute to your Victory.
But to defend, and make good what you have got, brings a long train of troubles and cala|mities
with it, as well upon your friends, as your foes. Nor will it suffice to exterminate
the race of the King; forasmuch as other Princes will remain, who upon occasion, will
make themselves heads of any Commotion, and they being neither to be satisfied nor ex|tinguished,
you must of necessity be expell'd upon the first Insurrection.
Now if it be considered what was the Nature of Darius his Government, it will be found
to have been very like the Turks, and therefore Alexander was obliged to fight them, and hav|ing
conquered them, and Darius dying after the Victory, the Empire of the Persians remain|ed
quietly to Alexander for the reasons abovesaid; and his Successors, had they continued
united, might have enjoyed it in peace, for in that whole Empire no Tumults succeeded, but
what were raised by themselves. But in Kingdoms that are constituted like France, it is o|therwise,
and impossible to possess them in quiet: From hence sprung the many defections
of Spain, France, and Greece from the Romans, by reason of the many little Principalities in
those several Kingdoms, of which, whil'st there remained any memory, the Romans enjoyed
their possession, in a great deal of incertainty, but when their memory was extinct, by power
and diuturnity of Empire, they grew secure in their possessions, and quarrelling afterwards
among themselves, every Officer of the Romans was able to bring a party into the field, ac|cording
to the latitude and extent of his Command in the said Provinces, and the reason was,
because the race of their old Princes being extirpate, there was no body left for them to ac|knowledge,
but the Romans. These things therefore being considered, it is not to be wondred
that Alexander had the good fortune to keep the Empire of Asia, whil'st the rest, as Pyrrhus
and others, found such difficulty to retain what they had got, for it came not to pass from
the small, or great Virtue of the Victor, but from the difference and variety of the Subject.


CHAP. V.
How such Cities and Principalities are to be Govern'd, who lived under
their own Laws, before they were subdued.
WHen States that are newly conquered, have been accustomed to their liberty, and
lived under their own Laws, to keep them, three ways are to be observed: The
first is utterly to ruine them; the second to live personally among them; the third is (con|tenting
your self with a Pension from them) to permit them to enjoy their old priviledges
and Laws, erecting a kind of Council of State, to consist of a few, which may have a care
of your interest, and keep the people in amity and obedience. And that Council being set
up by you, and knowing that it subsists only by your favour and authority, will not omit any
thing that may propagate and inlarge them. A Town that has been anciently free, cannot
more easily be kept in subjection, than by employing its own Citizens, as may be seen by
the Example of the Spartans, and Romans. The Spartans had got possession of Athens,
and Thebes, and setled an Oligarchie according to their fancy; and yet they lost them again.
The Romans to keep Capua, Carthage, and Numantia, ordered them to be destroyed, and
they kept them by that means. Thinking afterwards to preserve Greece, as the Spartans
had done, by allowing them their liberty, and indulging their old Laws, they found them|selves
mistaken; so that they were forced to subvert many Cities in that Province, before
they could keep it; and certainly that is the safest way which I know; for whoever conquers
a free Town, and does not demolish it, commits a great error, and may expect to be
ruin'd himself, because whenever the Citizens are disposed to a revolt, they betake them|selves
of course to that blessed name of Liberty, and the Laws of their Ancestors, which
no length of time, nor kind usage whatever will be able to eradicate, and let all possible
care and provision be made to the contrary, unless they be divided some way or other, or
the Inhabitants dispersed, the thought of their old priviledges will never out of their heads,
but upon all occasions they will endeavour to recover them, as Pisa did, after it had conti|nued
so many years in subjection to the Florentines; But it falls out quite contrary, where
the Cities or Provinces have been us'd to a Prince whose race is extirpated and gone; for
being on the one side accustomed to obey, and on the other, at a loss for their old Family,

they can never agree to set up another, and will never know how to live freely without; so
that they are not easily to be tempted to rebel, and the Prince may oblige them with less
difficulty, and be secure of them when he hath done. But in a Commonwealth their hatred
is more inverterate, their revenge more insatiable, nor does the memory of their ancient li|berty
ever suffer, or ever can suffer them to be quiet: So that the most secure way is either
to ruine them quite, or make your residence among them.


CHAP. VI.
Of Principalities acquired by ones own proper Conduct and Arms.
LEt no man think it strange, if in speaking of new Governments, either by Princes or
States, I introduce great and eminent Examples; forasmuch as men in their actions
follow commonly the ways that are beaten, and when they would do any generous thing,
they propose to themselves some pattern of that Nature; nevertheless, being impossible to
come up exactly to that, or to acquire that virtue in perfection which you desire to imitate;
a wise man, ought always to set before him for his Example the actions of great Men, who
have excell'd in the atchievement of some great Exploit, to the end that though his virtue
and power arrives not at that perfection, it may at least come as near as is possible, and
receive some tincture thereby: Like Experienced Archers, who observing the Mark to be
at great distance, and knowing the strength of their Bow, and how far it will carry, they
fix their aim somewhat higher than the Mark, not with design to shoot at that height,
but, that by mounting their Arrow to a certain proportion, they may come the nearer to
the Mark they intend. I say then, that Principalities newly acquited by an upstart Prince, are
more or less difficult to maintain, as he is more or less provident that gains them. And
because the happiness of rising from a private person to be a Prince, presupposes great Vir|tue,
or Fortune, where both of them concur, they do much facilitate the conservation of the
Conquest: yet he who has committed least to Fortune, has continued the longest. It
prevents much trouble likewise when the Prince (having no better residence elsewhere) is
constrained to live personally among them. But to speak of such who by their Virtue,
rather than Fortune, have advanced themselves to that Dignity, I say, that the most re|nowned
and excellent, are Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and the like: And though
Moses might be reasonably excepted, as being only the Executioner of God's immediate
Commands, yet he deserves to be mention'd, if it were only for that Grace, which render'd
him capable of Communication with God. But if we consider Cyrus, and the rest of the
Conquerors and Founders of Monarchies, we shall find them extraordinary; and examining
their Lives and Exploits, they will appear, not much different from Moses, who had so
incomparable a Master; for by their Conversations and Successes, they do not seem to have
received any thing from fortune, but occasion, and opportunity, in introducing what
forms of Government they pleas'd; and as without that occasion, the greatness of their
Courage had never been known, so had not they been magnanimous, and taken hold of it,
that occasion had hapned in vain. It was necessary therefore for Moses, that the people of
Israel should be in captivity in Egypt, that to free themselves from bondage, they might be
dispos'd to follow him: It was convenient that Romulus should be turned out of Albo, and
exposed to the wild beasts when he was young, that he might afterwards be made King of
Rome, and Founder of that great Empire. It was not unnecessary likewise that Cyrus
should ind the Persians mutining at the Tyranny of the Medes, and that the Medes
should be grown soft, and effeminate with their long peace. Theseus could never have
given proof of his Virtue and Generosity, had not the Athenians been in great troubles and
confusion. These great advantages, made those great persons Eminent, and their great
Wisdom knew how to improve them to the reputation, and enlargement of their Country.
They then who become great by the ways of Virtue (as the Princes abovesaid) do meet
with many difficulties, before they arrive at their ends, but having compass'd them once,
they easily keep them: The difficulties in the acquisition, arise in part from new Laws and
Customs which they are forc'd to introduce for the Establishment and security of their own
dominion; and this is to be considered that there is nothing more difficult to undertake,
more uncertain to succeed, and more dangerous to manage, than to make ones self Prince,
and prescribe new Laws: Because he who innovates in that manner has for his Enemies all
those who made any advantage by the Old Laws; and those who expect benefit by the new,
will be but cool and luke-warn in his defence; which luke-warmness proceeds from a cer|tain

awe for their adversaries who have their old Laws on their side, and partly from a na|tural
incredulity in mankind, which gives credit but slowly to any new thing, unless re|commended
first by the experiment of success. Hence it proceeds that the first time the ad|versary
has opportunity to make an attempt, he does it with great briskness, and vigour, but
the defence is so tpid and faint, that for the most part the new Prince, and his adhe|rents
perish together. Wherefore for better discussion of this case, it is necessary to in|quire
whether these innovators do stand upon their own feet, or depend upon other People;
that is to say whether in the conduct of their afairs, they do make more use of their rheto|rick,
than their Arms. In the first case, they commonly miscarry, and their designs sel|dom
succeed; but when their expectations are only from themselves, and they have
power in their own hands to make themselves obeyed, they run little or no hazard, and
do frequently prevail. For further eviction, the Scripture shows us that those of the Pro|phets
whose Armes were in their hands, and had power to compel, succeeded better in
the reformations which they designed; whereas those who came only with exhortation and
good language, suffer'd Martyrdom and Banishment, because (besides the reasons above
said) the People are unconstant, and susceptible of any new Doctrine at first, but not ea|sily
brought to retain it: so that things are to be ordered in such manner that when their
Faith begins to stagger, they may be forc'd to persist. Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Ro|mulus
could never have made their Laws to have been long observed, had they not had
power to have compelled it; as in our days it happen'd to Frier Ierome Savanorola, who
ruined himself by his new institutions, as soon as the People of Florence began to desert
him; for he had no means to confirm them who had been of his opinion, nor to constrain
such as dissented. Wherefore such persons meet with great difficulty in their affairs; all
their dangers are still by the way, which they can hardly overcome, but by some extraor|dinary
virtue, and excellence: nevertheless when once they have surmounted them, and
arrived at any degree of veneration, having supplanted those who envyed their advance|ment,
they remain puissant, and firm, and honorable, and happy. I will add to these
great examples, another, perhaps not so conspicuous; but one that will bear a proportion
and resemblance with the rest, and shall satisfie me for all others of that nature. It is of
Hiero of Syracuse, who of a private person was made Prince of that City, for which he was
beholding to fortune no further than for the occasion, because the Syracusans being under
oppression, chose him for their Captain, in which command he behav'd himself so well, he
deserved to be made their Prince, for he was a person of so great virtue and excellence, that
those who have writ of him, have given him this Character, that even in his private condition,
he wanted nothing, but a Kingdom to make him an admirable King. This Hiero subdued
the old Militia, established a new; renounced the old Allies; confederated with others; and
having friends and forces of his own, he was able upon such a foundation to erect what
fabrick he pleas'd; so that though the acquisition cost him much trouble, he maintain'd it
with little.


CHAP. VII.
Of new Principalities acquired by accident, and the supplies
of other People.
THey who from private condition ascend to be Princes, and meerly by the indulgence
of fortune, arrive without much trouble at their dignity, though it costs them dear
to maintain it, meet but little difficulty in their passage, being hurried as it were with
wings, yet when they come to settle and establish, then begins their misery. These kind
of Persons are such as attain their dignity by Bribes, or concession of some other great
Prince, as it hapned to several in Greece in the Cities of Ionia, and upon the Hellespont;
where they were invested with that power by Darius for his greater security and Glory, and
to those Emperours who arrived at the Empire by the corruption of the Souldiers. These
persons I say, subsist wholly upon the pleasure and fortune of those who advanced them,
which being two things very valuable and uncertain; they have neither knowledg nor power
to continue long in that degree; know not, because unless he be a Man of extraordinary quali|ties
and virtue, it is not reasonable to think he can know how to command other people,
who before lived always in a private condition himself; cannot, because they have no for|ces
upon whose friendship, and fidelity they can rely. Moreover States which are suddenly
conquered (as all things else in nature whose rise and increase is so speedy) can have no root or

foundation, but what will be shaken and supplanted by the first gust of adversity, unless
they who have been so suddenly exalted, be so wise as to prepare prudently in time for the
conservation of what fortune threw so luckily into their lap, and establish afterwards such fun|damentals
for their duration, as others (which I mentioned before) have done in the like
cases. About the arrival at this Authority either by virtue, or good fortune I shall in|stance
in two examples that are fresh in our memory, one is Francis Sforza, the other Cae|sar
Borgio; Sforza by just means, and extraordinary virtue made himself Duke of Milan,
and enjoyed it in great peace, though gained with much trouble. Borgia on the other side
(called commonly Duke of Valentine) got several fair territories by the fortune of his Father
Pope Alexander, and lost them all after his death, though he used all his industry, and em|ployed
all the Arts which a wise and brave Prince ought to do to fix himself in the sphear,
where the Arms, and fortune of other people had placed him: For he (as I said before)
who laid not his foundation in time, may yet raise his superstructure, but with great trouble
to the Architect, and great danger to the building. If therefore the whole progress of the
said Duke be considered, it will be found what solid foundations he had laid for his future
dominion, of which progress I think it not superfluous to discourse, because I know not
what better precepts to display before a new Prince, than the example of his actions, and
though his own orders and methods did him no good, it was not so much his fault, as the
malignity of his fortune.
Pope Alexander the sixth had a desire to make his Son Duke Valentine great, but he saw ma|ny
blocks and impediments in the way both for the present, and future. First he could not
see any way to advance him to any territory that depended not upon the Church, and to
those in his gift, he was sure the Duke of Milan, and the Venetians would never consent,
for Faenza and Riminum had already put themselves under the Venetian protection. He
was likewise sensible that the forces of Italy, especially those who were capable of assisting
him, were in the hands of those who ought to apprehend the greatness of the Pope, as the
Ursini, Colonnesi, and their followers, and therefore could not repose any great confidence
in them: besides, the Laws and alliances of all the States in Italy must of necessity be distur|bed,
before he could make himself Master of any part, which was no hard matter to do,
finding the Venetians upon some private interest of their own, inviting the French to another
expedition into Italy, which his Holiness was so far from opposing, that he promoted it
by dissolution of King Lewis his former marriage. Lewis therefore passed the Alps by
the assistance of the Venetians, and Alexanders consent, and was no sooner in Milan, but
he sent forces to assist the Pope in his enterprize against Romagna, which was immediatly
surrendred upon the Kings reputation. Romagna being in this manner reduc'd by the Duke,
and the Colonnesi defeated, being ambitious not only to keep what he had got, but to ad|vance
in his Conquests, two things obstructed; one was the infidelity of his own Army;
the other, the aversion of the French: for he was jealous of the forces of the Ursini who
were in his service; suspected by would fail him in his need, and either hinder his con|quest,
or take it from him when he had done; and the same fears he had of the French; and
his jealousie of the Ursini was much increased, when after the expugnation of Faenza, assaul|ting
Bologna, he found them very cold and backward in the attack: and the King's incli|nation
he discover'd, when having possess'd himself of the Dutchy of Urbin, he invaded
Tuscany, and was by him requir'd to desist. Whereupon the Duke resolved to depend no
longer upon fortune, and foraign assistance, and the first course he took, was to weaken
the party of the Ursini, and Colonni in Rome, which he effected very neatly by debauch|ing
such of their adherants as were Gentlemen, taking them into his own service, and gi|ving
them honorable pensions, and Governments, and Commands, according to their
respective qualities, so that in a few months, their passion for that faction evaporated, and
they turn'd all for the Duke. After this he attended an opportunity of supplanting the Ur|sini,
as he had done the Family of the Colonni before; which happened very luckily, and
was as luckily improved: for the Ursini considering too late, that the greatness of the Duke
and the Church tended to their ruine, held a Council at a place called Magione in Perugia,
which occasioned the rebellion of Urbin, the tumults in Romagna, and a thousand dangers
to the Duke besides; but though he overcame them all by the assistance of the French, and
recovered his reputation, yet he grew weary of his foreign allies, as having nothing fur|ther
to oblige them, and betook himself to his artifice, which he managed so dexterously,
that the Ursini reconciled themselves to him, by the mediation of Seignor Paulo, with
whom for his security he comported so handsomly by presenting with mony, rich stuffs,
and Horses, that being convinced of his integrity, he conducted them to Sinigaglia, and
deliver'd them into the Dukes hands. Having by this means exterminated the chief of
his adversaries, and reduc'd their friends, the Duke had laid a fair foundation for his great|ness,

having gain'd Romagna and the Dutchy of Urbin, and insinuated with the People by
giving them a gust of their future felicity. And because this part is not unworthy to be known
for imitation sake, I will not pass it in silence. When the Duke had possess'd himself of
Romagna, finding it had been governed by poor and inferiour Lord's, who had rather
robb'd than corrected their Subjects, and given them more occasion of discord than unity,
insomuch as that Province was full of robberies, riots, and all manner of insolencies; to
reduce them to unanimity, and subjection to Monarchy, he thought it necessary to pro|vide
them a good Governor, and thereupon he confer'd that charge upon Rmiro d' Orco,
with absolute power, though he was a cruel, and a passionate Man. Orce was not
long before he had settled it in peace, with no small reputation to himself. Afterwards the
Duke apprehending so large a power might grow odious to the people, he erected a Court
of judicature in the middle of the Province, in which every City had its advocate, and an
excellent person was appointed to preside. And because he discover'd that his pass'd verity
had created him many Enemies; to remove that ill opinion, and recover the affections of
the people he had a mind to show that if any cruelty had been exercised, it proceeded not
from him, but from the arrogance of his Minister; and for their further confirmation; he
caused the said Governor to be apprehended, and his Head chopt off one morning in the
Market place at Cesena, with a wooden dagger on one side of him, and a bloody knife on
the other; the ferocity of which spectacle not only appeas'd, but amaz'd the people for a
while. But reassuming our discourse, I say, the Duke finding himself powerfull enough,
and secure against present danger, being himself as strong as he desired, and his neighbours
in a manner reduced to an incapacity of hurting him, being willing to go on with his con|quests,
there remaining nothing but a jealousie of France, and not without cause, for he knew
that King had found his errour at last, and would be sure to obstruct him. Hereupon he be|gan
to look abroad for new allies, and to haesitate and stagger towards France, as appear|ed
when the French Army advanced into the Kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who
had besieg'd Cajeta; his great design was to secure himself against the French, and he had
doubtless done it, if Alexander had lived. These were his provisions against the dangers
that were imminent, but those that were remote, were more doubtful and uncertain. The
first thing he feared was, lest the next Pope should be his enemy,  reassume all that Alexan|der
had given him, to prevent which he proposed four several ways. The first was by de|stroying
the whole line of those Lord's whom he had dispossess'd, that his Holiness might
have no occasion to restore them; The second was to cajole the Nobility in Rome, and draw
them over to his party, that thereby he might put an aw, and restraint upon the Pope.
The third was, if possible to make the Colledge his friends. The fourth was to make
himself so strong before the Death of his Father, as to be able to stand upon his own legs,
and repel the first violence that should be practised against him. Three of these four expe|dients
he had try'dbefore Alexander died, and was in a fair way for the fourth, all the
disseiz'd Lord's which came into his Clutches, he put to death, and left few of them re|maining:
he had insinuated with the Nobility of Rome and got a great party in the Col|ledge
of Cardinals, and as to his own corroboration, he had design'd to make himself Ma|ster
of Tuscany, had got possession of Perugia, and Piombino already, and taken Pisa into
his protection: and having now farther regard of the French (who where beaten out of
the Kingdom of Naples by the Spaniard, and both of them reduc'd to necessity of seeking
his amity) he leapt bluntly into Pisa, after which Lucca, and Sienna submitted without
much trouble, partly in hatred to the Florentines, and partly for fear, and the Florentines
were grown desperate  without any hopes of relief; so that had these things happened before,
as they did the same year in which Alexander died, doubtless he had gain'd so much strength
and reputation, that he would have stood firm by himself, upon the basis of his own pow|er
and conduct without depending upon fortune, or any foreignsupplies. But his Fa|ther
died five years after his Son had taken up Arms, and left him nothing solid, and in
certainty but Romagna only, and the rest were in nubious, infested with two formidable Ar|mies,
and himself mortally sick. This Duke was a Man of that magnanimity and prudence,
understood so well which way Men were to be wheedled, or destroy'd, and such were the
foundations that he had laid in a short time, that had he not had those two great Armies
upon his back, and a fierce distemper upon his body, he had overcome all difficulties, and
brought his designs to perfection. That the foundations which he had laid were plausible,
appear'd by the patience of his Subjects in Romagna who held out for him a compleat
month, though they knew he was at deaths door, and unlikely ever to come out of Rome:
to which place though the Baglioni, the Vitelli, and Ursini return'd, seeing there was
no likelyhood of his recovery, yet they could not gain any of his party, nor debauch them
to their side: 'tis possible he was not able to put who he pleas'd into the Pontifical chair,

yet he had power enough to keep any man out who he thought was his Enemy: But had
it been his fortune to have been well when his Father Alexander died, all things had suc|ceeded
to his mind. He told me himself about the time that Iulius XI. was created, that
he had considered well the accidents that might befal him upon the death of his Father, and
provided against them all, only he did no imagine that at his death, he should be so near it
himself. Upon serious Examination therefore of the whole Conduct of Duke Valentine, I
see nothing to be reprehended, it seems rather proper to me to propose him (as I have done)
as an Example for the imitation of all such as by the favour of fortune, or the supplies of
other Princes, have got into the saddle; for his mind being so large, and his intentions so
high, he could not do otherwise, and nothing could have opposed the greatness and wis|dom
of his designs, but his own infirmity, and the death of his Father. He therefore who
thinks it necessary in the minority of his Dominion to secure himself against his Enemies;
to gain himself Friends, to overcome whether by force, or by fraud; to make himself
belov'd, or fear'd by his people; to be followed and reverenced by his Soldiers; to destory
and exterminate such as would do him injury; to repeal and suppress old Laws, and intro|duce
new; to be severe, grateful, magnanimous, liberal, cashier and disband such of his
Army as were unfaithful, and put new in their places; manage himself so in his alliances
with Kings and Princes, that all of them should be either obliged to requite him, or affear'd
to offend him; He, I say cannot find a fresher or better Model than the actions of this Prince.
If in any thing he be to be condemned, it is in suffering the Election of Iulius XI. which
was much to his prejudice; for though (as is said before) he might be unable to make the
Pope as he pleased; yet it was in his power to have put any one by, and he ought never to
have consented to the Election of any of the Cardinals whom he had formerly offended, or
who after their promotion were like to be jealous of him; for men are as mischievous for
fear, as for hatred. Those Cardinals which he had disobliged, were among others, the
Cardinals of St. Peter ad Vincula, Collonno St. George, and Ascanius. The rest, if any of
them were advanced, to the Papacy, might well be afraid of him, except the Spanish Cardi|nals,
and the Cardinal of Roan; The Spaniards by reason of their obligations and alliance;
and the other, by reason of his interest in the Kingdom of France. Wherefore above all
things, the Duke should have made a Spanish Cardinal Pope; and if that could not have
been done, he should rather have consented to the Election of Roan, than St. Peter ad Vin|cula;
for 'tis weakness to believe, that among great persons, new obligations can obliterate
old injuries and disgusts. So that in the Election of this Iulius XI. Duke Valentine com|mitted
and Error that was the cause of his utter destruction.


CHAP. VIII.
Of such as have arriv'd at their Dominion, by
wicked and injustifiable means
NOw because there are two ways from a private person to become a Prince, which ways
are not altogether to be attributed either to fortune or management, I think it not
convenient to pretermit them, though of one of them I may speak more largely where
occasion is offered to treat more particularly of Republicks. One of the ways is when one
is advanced to the Soveraignty by any illegal nefarious means: The other when a Citi|zen
by the favour and partiality of his Fellow-Citizens is made Prince of his Country. I
shall speak of the first in this Chapter, and justifie what I say by two Examples, one Ancient,
the other Modern, without entring farther into the merits of the cause, as judging them
sufficient for any man who is necessitated to follow them. Agathocles the Sicilian, not only
from a private, but from a vile and abject Condition, was made King of Syracuse, and be|ing
but the Son of a Potter, he continued the dissoluteness of his life, thorow all the degrees
of his fortune: Nevertheless his vices were accompanied with such courage and activity,
that he applyed himself to the Wars, by which, and his great industry, he came at length
to the Pretor of Syracuse: Being settled in that Dignity, and having concluded to make him|self
Prince, and hold that by violence, without obligation to any body, which was conferred
upon him by consent, he settled an intelligence with Amilcar the Carthaginian, who was
then at the head of an Army in Sicily, and calling the People and Senate of Syracuse toge|ther
one morning, as if he had been to consult them in some matter of importance to the
State, upon a signal appointed, he caus'd his Soldiers to kill all the Senators and the most
wealthy of the People; after whose death, he usurped and possessed the Dominion of that

City without any obstruction: and though afterwards he lost two great Battels to the
Carthaginians, and at length was besieg'd, yet he was not only able to defend that City, but
leaving part of his forces for the security of that, with the rest he transported into Africk,
and ordered things so, that in a short time he reliev'd Syracuse, and reduced the Carthagi|nians
into such extream necessity, that they were glad to make peace with him, and content|ing
themselves with Africk, leave Sicily to Agathocles. He then who examines the Exploits
and Conduct of Agathocles will find little or nothing that may be attributed to fortune,
seeing he rose not (as is said before) by the favour of any man, but by the steps and grada|tions
of War; with a thousand difficulties and dangers having gotten that Government,
which he maintained afterwards with as many noble Atchievements. Nevertheless it cannot
be called Virtue in him to kill his fellow-Citizens, betray his Friends, to be without faith,
without pity, or Religion; these are ways may get a Man Empire, but no glory nor repu|tation:
Yet if the Wisdom of Agathocles be considered, his dexterity in encountring, and
overcoming of dangers, his Courage in supporting and surmounting his misfortunes; I do
not see why he should be held inferiour to the best Captains of his time. But his unbounded
cruelty, and barbarous inhumanity, added to a million of other Vices, will not permit that
he be numbred amongst the most Fxcellent Men. So then that which he performed cannot
justly be attributed to either Fortune or Virtue, for he did all himself without either the one
or the other. In our days under the Papacy of Alexander VI. Oliverotto da Fermo being
left young many years since by his Parents, was brought up by his Unckle by the Mothers
side, call'd Iohn Togliani, and in his youth listed a Soldier under Paulo Vitelli, that having
improved himself by his Discipline, he might be capable of some Eminent Command.
Paulo being dead, he served under Vitellezzo his Brother and in short time by the acuteness
of his parts, and the briskness of his Courage, became one of the best Officers in his Army.
But thinking it beneath him to continue in any Man's Service, he conspir'd with some of
his fellow-Citizens of Fermo (to whom the servitude of their Country, was more agreeable
than its liberty) by the help of Vitellesco to seize upon Fermo: In order to which, he writ a
Letter to his Unckle Iohn Fogliano, importing, That having been absent many years, he
had thoughts of visiting him and Fermo, and taking some little diversion in the place
where he was born, and because the design of his Service had been only the gaining of Ho|nour,
That his fellow-Citizens might see his time had not been ill spent, he desired admis|sion
for a hundred Horse of his Friends, and his Equipage, and beg'd of him that he would
take care they might be honourably received, which would redound not only to his Honour,
but his Unckles, who had had the bringing him up. Iohn was not wanting in any Office to
his Nephew, and having caus'd him to be nobly received, he lodged him in his own House,
where he continued some days, preparing in the mean time what was necessary to the Exe|cution
of his wicked design: he made a great Entertainment, to which he invited Iohn
Fogliani, and all the chief Citizens in the Town. About the end of the treatment, when
they were entertaining one another, as is usual at such times, Oliverotto very subtilly pro|moted
certain grave discourses about the greatness of Pope Alexander, and Cesar his Son,
and of their Designs; Iohn and the rest replying freely to what was said, Oliverotto smil'd,
and told them those were points to be argued more privately, and thereupon removing
into a chamber, his Unckle, and the rest of his fellow-Citizens followed; They were scarce
sate down, before Soldiers (which were conceal'd about the room) came forth, and kill'd all
of them, and the Unckle among the rest; After the Murder was committed Oliverotto
mounted on Horseback, rode about, and rummaged the whole Town, having besieged the
chief Magistrate, in his Palace; so that for fear, all people submitted, and he establish'd a
Government of which he made himself Head. Having put such to death as were discontent|ed,
and in any capacity of doing him hurt, he fortified himself with new Laws, both Military
and Civil, insomuch as in a years time he had not only fix'd himself in Fermo, but was
become terrible to all that were about him; and he would have been as hard as Agathocles
to be supplanted, had he not suffered himself to have been circumvented by Cesar Borgia,
when at Singalia (as aforesaid) he took the Ursini, and Vitelli; where also he himself was
taken a year after his Parracide was committed, and strangled with his Master Vitellozzo
from whom he had learned all his good qualities, and evil
It may seem wonderful to some people how it should come to pass that Agathocles, and
such as he, after so many Treacheries, and acts of inhumanity, should live quietly in their
own Country so long, defend themselves so well against foreign Enemies, and none of their
Subjects conspire against them at home; seeing several others, by reason of their cruelty,
have not been able, even in times of Peace, as well as War, to defend their Government.
I conceive it fell out according as their cruelty was well or ill applyed: I say well applyed
(if that word may be added to an ill action) and it may be called so, when commited but

once, and that of necessity for ones own preservation, but never repeated afterwards, and
even then converted as much as possible to the benefit of the Subjects. Ill applyed, are such
cruelties as are but few in the beginning, but in time do rather multiply than decrease.
Those who are guilty of the first, do receive assistance sometimes both from God and Man,
and Agathocles is an instance. But the others cannot possibly subsist long: From whence it
is to be observed, that he who usurps the Government of any State, is to execute and put
in practice all the cruelties which he thinks material at once, that he may have no occasion to
renue them often, but that by his discontinuance, he may mollifie the People, and by his
benefits bring them over to his side: He who does otherwise, whether for fear, or ill Coun|sel,
is obliged to be always ready with his Knife in his hand, for he can never repose any
confidence in his Subjects, whilst they, by reason of his fresh and continued inhumanities
cannot be secure against him: So then Injuries are to be committed all at once, that the
last being the less, the distaste may be likewise the less; but benefits should be distilled by
drops, that the relish may be the greater. Above all a Prince is so to behave himself towards
his Subjects, that neither good fortune or bad should be able to alter him; for being once
assaulted with adversity, you have no time to do mischief, and the good which you do, does
you no good, being looked upon as forced, and so no thanks to be due for it.


CHAP. IX.
Of Civil Principality.
I Shall speak now of the other way, when a Principal Citizen, not by wicked contrivance,
or intolerable violence is made Soveraign of his Country, which may be called a Civil
Principality, and is not to be attained by either Virtue, or Fortune alone, but by a lucky
sort of craft; This Man I say arrives at the Government by the favour of the People or No|bility;
for in all Cities the meaner, and the better sort of Citizens are of different humours,
and it proceeds from hence that the common people are not willing to be commanded and
oppressed by the great ones, and the great ones are not to be satisfied without it: From this
diversity of appetite, one of these three Effects do arise, Principality, Liberty, or Licen|tiousness.
Principality is caused either by the people, or the great ones, as, either the one, or
the other has occasion: The great ones finding themselves unable to resist the popular tor|rent,
do many times unanimously confer their whole Authoriry upon one Person, and create
him Prince, that under his protection they may be quiet and secure. The people on the
other side, when over-power'd by their Adversaries, do the same thing, transmitting their
power to a single Person, who is made King for their better defence. He who arrives at
the Soveraignty by the assistance of the great ones, preserves it with more difficulty, than
he who is advanced by the people, because he has about him many of his old Associates, who
thinking themselves his Equals, are not to be directed and managed as he would have them.
But he that is preferred by the people, stands alone without Equals, and has no body, or
very few about him, but what are ready to obey: Moreover the Grandees are hardly to be
satisfied without injury to others, which is otherwise with the people, because their designs
are more reasonable, than the designs of the great ones, which are fixt upon commanding,
and oppressing altogether, whil'st the people endeavour only to defend and secure them|selves.
Moreover where the people is adverse, the Prince can never be safe, by reason of
their numbers, whereas the great ones are but few, and by consequence not so dangerous.
The worst that a Prince can expect from an injured and incensed people, is to be deserted;
but if the great ones by provoked, he is not only to fear abandoning, but conspiracy, and
banding against him; for the greater sort being more provident and cunning, they look
out in time to their own safety, and make their interest with the Person, who they hope will
overcome. Besides the Prince is obliged to live always with one and the same people, but
with the Grandees he is under no such obligation, for he may create, and degrade ad|vance
and remove them as he pleases. But for the better Explication of this part, I say,
That these great men are to be considered two ways especially; That is, whether in the
manner of their administration they do wholly follow the fortune and interest of the Prince,
or whether they do otherwise. Those who devote themselves entirely to his business, and
are not rapacious, are to be valued and preferred. Those who are more remiss, and will
not stick to their Prince, do it commonly upon two Motives, either out of laziness or fear
(and in those cases they may be employed, especially if they be wise and of good Counsel,
because if affairs prosper, thou gainest honour thereby; if they miscarry, thou needest not

to fear them) or upon ambition, and design, and that is a token that their thoughts are
more intent upon their own advantage than thine. Of these a Prince ought always to have
a more than ordinary care, and order them as if they were Enemies professed, for in his
distress they will be sure to set him forwards, and do what they can to destroy him. He
therefore who comes to be Prince by the favour and suffrage of the People, is obliged to
keep them his friends, which (their desire being nothing but freedom from oppression)
may be easily done. But he that is preferred by the interest of the Nobles against the minds
of the Commons, is above all things to endeavour to ingratiate with the People, which
will be as the other if he undertakes their protection: And Men receiving good Offices,
where they expected ill, are indear'd by the surprize, and become better affected to their
Benefactor, than perhaps they would have been, had he been made Prince by their imme|diate
favour. There are many ways of insinuating with the People, of which no certain
rule can be given, because they vary according to the diversity of the subject, and therefore
I shall pass them at this time concluding with this assertion, that it is necessary above all
things, that a Prince preserves the affections of his people, otherwise in any Exigence, he
has no refuge nor remedy. Nabides Prince of the Spartans, sustained all Greece, and a Vi|ctorious
Army of the Romans, and defended the Government and Country against them all;
and to do that great action, it was sufficient for him to secure himself against the Machina|tions
of a few, whereas if the People had been his Enemy, that would not have done it.
Let no man impugn my opinion with that old saying, he that builds upon the People, builds
upon the sand. That is true indeed when a Citizen of private Condition relies upon the
people, and persuades himself that when the Magistrate, or his Adversary, goes about to
oppress him, they will bring him off, in which case many presidents may be produced, and
particularly the Gracchi in Rome, and Georgio Scali in Florence. But if the Prince that
builds upon them, knows how to command, and be a man of Courage not dejected in
adversity, nor deficient in his other preparations, but keeps up the spirits of his people by his
own Valour and Conduct, he shall never be deserted by them, nor find his foundations laid
in a wrong place.
These kind of Governments are most tottering and uncertain, when the Prince strains of a
sudden, and passes (as at one leap) from a Civil, to an absolute power, and the reason is,
because they either command, and act by themselves, or by the Ministry and Mediation of
the Magistrate: In this last case their authority is weaker, and more ticklish, because it de|pends
much upon the pleasure and concurrence of the Chief Officers, who (in time of ad|versity
especially) can remove them easily, either by neglecting, or resisting their Com|mands:
nor is there any way for such a Prince in the perplexity of his affairs to establish a
Tyranny because those Citizens and Subjects who used to exercise the Magistracy, retain
still such power and influence upon the people, that they will not infringe the Laws, to
obey his; and in time of danger he shall always want such as he can trust, So that a Prince
is not to take his measures according to what he sees in times of peace when of the Subjects
(having nothing to do but to be governed) every one runs, every one promises, and every
one dyes for him, when death is at a distance: but when times are tempestuous, and the
ship of the State has need of the help and assistance of the Subject, there are but few will
expose themselves: And this experiment is the more dangerous, because it can
be practised but once: So then, a Prince who is provident and wise ought to carry
himself so, that in all place, times, and occasions the People may have need of his ad|ministration
and Regiment, an ever after they shall be faithful and true.


CHAP. X.
How the strength of all principalities is to be computed.
TO any man that examines the nature of principalities, it is worthy his consideration,
whether a Prince has power and territory enough to subsist by himself, or whether he
needs the assistance, and protection of other People. To clear the point a little better, I
think those Princes capable of ruling, who are able either by the numbers of their men, or
the greatness of their wealth to raise a compleat Army, and bid Battel to any that shall
invade them; and those I think depend upon others, who of themselves dare not meet their
Enemy in the field, but are forced to keep within their bounds, and defend them as well as
they can. Of the first we have spoken already, and shall say more as occasion is presented.
Of the second no more can be said, but to advise such Princes to strengthen and fortifie the

Capital Town in their Dominions, and not to trouble himself with the whole Country;
and whoever shall do that, and in other things, manage himself with the Subjects as I have
described, and perhaps shall do hereafter, shall with great caution be invaded, for men are
generally wary and tender of enterprizing any thing that is difficult and no great easiness
is to be found in attacking a Town well fortified and provided, where the Prince is not
hated by the People.
The Towns in Germany are many of them free; though their Country and district be but
small, yet they obey the Emperor but when they please, and are in no awe either of him,
or any other Prince of the Empire, because they are all so well fortified, every one looks
upon the taking of any one of them as a work of great difficulty and time, their Wals being
so strong, their Ditches so deep, their works so regular, and well provided with Cannon,
and their stores and Magazines always furnish'd for a Twelvemonth. Besides which, for the
aliment and sustenance of the People, and that they may be no burthen to the publick, they
have work-houses where for a year together the poor may be employed in such things as are
the Nerves and life of that City, and sustain themselves by their labour. Military Discipline
and Exercises are likewise much request there, and many Laws and good Customs they
have to maintain them.
A Prince then who has a City well fortified, and the affections of his people, is not easily
to be molested, and he that does molest him, is like to repent it, for the affairs of this world
are so various, it is almost impossible for any Army to lie quietly a whole year before a
Town, without interruption. If any objects that the people having houses and possessions
out of the Town, will not have patience to see them plundered and burned; and that Cha|rity
to themselves will make them forget their Prince; I answer, that a wise and dexterous
Prince will easily evade those difficulties, by encouraging his Subjects and persuading them,
sometimes their troubles will not be long; sometimes, inculcating, and possessing them with
the cruelty of the Enemy; and sometimes by correcting and securing himself nimbly of such
as appear too turbulent and audacious. Moreover the usual practice is for the Enemy to
plunder and set the Country on fire at their first coming, whil'st every man's spirits is high,
and fixed upon defence; so that the Prince needs not concern himself, nor be fearful of that
for those mischiefs are pass'd, and inconveniencies received, and when the People in three
or four days time begin to be cool, and consider things soberly, they will find there is no
remedy and joyn more cordially with the Prince, looking upon him as under an obligation
to them, for having sacrificed their Houses and Estates in his defence. And the nature of
Man is such, to take as much pleasure in having obliged another, as in being obliged himself.
Wherefore all things fairly considered, it is no such hard matter for a Prince not only to gain,
but to retain the affection of his Subjects, and make them patient of a long Siege, if he be
wise, and provident, and takes care, they want nothing, either for their livelyhood or
defence.


CHAP. XI
Of Ecclesiastical Principalities
THere remains nothing of this Nature to be discoursed, but of Ecclesiastical Principa|lities
about which the greatest difficulty is to get into possession, because they are
gained either by Fortune or Virtue, but kept without either, being supported by
ancient Statutes universally received in the Christian Church, which are of such power and
authority, they do keep their Prince in his dignity, let his conversation or conduct be what it
will. These are the only persons who have lands  do not defend them, Subjects,  do not go|vern
them, and yet their lands are not taken from them though they never defend them, nor
their Subjects dissatisfied, though they never regard them; so that these Principalities are
the happiest and most secure in the world; but being managed by a supernatural power
above the wisdom and contrivance of man; I shall speak no more of them, for being set
up, and continued by God himself, it would be great presumption in any man who should
undertake to dispute them. Nevertheless, if it should be questioned how it came to pass
that in Temporal things the Church is arrived at that height, seeing that before, Alexan|der's
time, the Italian Ptinces, not only such as were Soveraigns, but every Baron and Lord,
how inconsiderable soever in Temporal affairs, esteemed of them but little; yet since, it
has been able not only to startle and confront the King of France, but to drive him out of
Italy, and to ruine the Venetians, the reason of which, though already well known, I think
it not superfluous, to revive in some measure.

Before Charles King of France passed himself into Italy, that Province was under the
Empire of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, Duke of Milan, and the Floren|tines.
It was the interest of these Potentates, to have a care, some of them that no foreign
Prince should come with an Army into Italy, and some that none among themselves should
usurp upon the other. Those of whom the rest were concern'd to be most jealous,
were the Pope, and the Venetian: to restrain the Venetians, all the rest were us'd to con|federate,
as in the defence of Ferrara. To keep under the Pope, the Roman Barons contri|buted
much, who being divided into two factions (the Ursini, and Colonnessi in perpetual
contention, with their Arms constantly in their hands under the very nose of the Pope) they
kept the Pontifical power very low, and infirm: and although now and then there happened
a couragious Pope (as Sextus) yet neither his courage, wisdom, nor fortune was able to
disintangle him from those incommodities; and the shortness of their reign was the reason
thereof; for ten years time (which was as much as any of them reign'd) was scarce suf|ficient
for the suppression of either of the parties, and when the Colonnesi as a man may say
were almost extinct, a new Enemy sprang up against the Ursini, which revived the Colonne|si,
and reestablished them again. This emulation and animosity at home, was the cause
the Pope was no more formidable in Italy; after this Alexander VI. was advanc'd to the Pa|pacy,
who more than all that had ever been before him, demonstrated what a Pope with
mony and power was able to do; having taken advantage of the French invasion, by the
Ministry and conduct of Duke Valentine, he performed all that I have mentioned else where
among the Actions of the said Duke. And though his design was not so much to advantage
the Church, as to aggrandize the Duke, yet what he did for the one, turned afterwards
to the benefit of the other, for the Pope being dead, and Valentine extinct, what both of
them had got, devolv'd upon the Church: after him Iulius succeeded, and found the
Church in a flourishing condition; Romagna was wholly in its possession, the Barons of
Rome exterminated, and gone, and their factions suppressed by Pope Alexander, and be|sides,
a way opened for raising and hoarding of mony never practised before; which way
Iulius improving rather than otherwise, he began to entertain thoughts, not only of con|quering
Bologna, but mastering the Venetians, and forcing the French out of Italy. All
which great enterprizes succeeding, it added much to his honor that he impropriated no|thing,
but gave all to the Church. He maintained also the Colonnesi and Ursini in the same
condition as he found them, and though in case of sedition there were those ready on both
sides to have headed them, yet there were two considerations which kept them at Peace.
One was the greatness of the Church which kept them in awe; the other was their want of
Cardinals, which indeed was the Original of their discontents, and will never cease till
some of them be advanced to that dignity; for by them the Parties in Rome and without,
are maintained, aud the Barons oblig'd to defend them; so that the ambition of the pre|lates
is the cause of all the dissention and tumults among the Barons.
His present Holiness Pope Leo had the happiness to be elected at a time when it was most
powerful, and it is hop'd, if they made the Church great by their Arms, he by the inte|grity
of his conversation and a thousand other virtues will enlarge it much more and make
it more venerable and august.


CHAP. XII.
How many forms there are of Military Discipline, and of those Souldiers
which are called Mercenary
HAving spoken particularly of the several sorts of Principalities as I proposed in the be|ginning;
considered in part the reasons of their constitution and their evil; and
the ways which many have taken to acquire, and preserve them; it remains that I pro|ceed
now in a general way upon such things as may conduce to the offence, or defence of
either of them.
We have declared before that it is not only expedient, but necessary for a Prince to take
care his foundations be good, otherwise his fabrick will be sure to fail.
The principal foundations of all States, (new, old, or mixt) are good Laws, and good
Arms, and because there cannot be good Laws, where there are not good arms,
and where the Arms are good, there must be good Laws, I shall pass by the Laws, and
discourse of the Arms.
I say, the Arms then with which a Prince defends his State, are his own, Mercenary, Auxilia|ry

or mixt. The Mercenary, and Auxiliary are unprofitable, and dangerous, and that
Prince who founds the duration of his Government upon his Mercenary forces, shall never
be firm nor secure, for they are divided, ambitious, undisciplin'd, unfaithful, insolent to
their friends, abject to their Enemies, without fear of God, or faith to Men, so the ruine
of that person who trusts to them is no longer protracted, than the attempt is deferred;
in time of peace they divorce you, in time of War they desert you, and the reason is be|cause
it is not love, nor any principle of honor that keeps them in the field, 'tis only their
pay, and that is not a consideration strong enough to prevail with them to die for you;
whilst you have more service to imploy them in, they are excellent Souldiers; but tell them
of an engagement, and they will either disband before, or run away in the battel.
And to evince this, would require no great pains; seeing the ruine of Italy proceeded
from no other cause, than that for several years together it had repos'd it self upon Merce|nary
Arms; which forces 'tis possible may have formerly done service to some particular per|son,
and behav'd themselves well enough among one another, but no sooner were they
attackt by a powerful foreigner, but they discovered themselves, and shewed what they
were to the World: hence it was that Charles 8 chaulk'd out his own way into Italy; and
that person was in the right, who affirmed our own faults were the cause of our miseries;
but it was not those faults he believed, but those I have mention'd, which being commit|ted
most eminently by Princes, they suffered most remarkably in the punishment. But
to come closer to the point, and give you a clearer prospect of the imperfection and infe|licity
of those forces. The great officers of these mercenaries, are Men of great courage, or
otherwise; if the first, you can never be safe, for they always aspire to make themselves
great, either by supplanting of you who is their Master, or oppressing of other People,
whom you desir'd to have preserved; and on the other side, if the Commanders be not
couragious you are ruined again; if it should be urged that all Generals will do the same,
whether mercenaries or others, I would answer, that all War is managed either by a Prince
or Republick: the Prince is obliged to go in person, and perform the office of General
himself: the Republick must depute some one of her choice Citizens, who is to be changed,
if he carries himself ill; If he behaves himself well, he is to be continued, but so straitned
and circumscrib'd by his commission, that he may not transgress: and indeed experience
tells us that Princes alone, and Common wealths alone with their own private forces have
performed great things, whereas mercenaries do nothing but hurt. Besides, a martial
Commonwealth that stands upon its own legs, and maintains it self by its own prowess, is
not easily usurp'd, and falls not so readily under the obedience of one of their fellow Citi|zens,
as where all the forces are foreign. Rome, and Sparta maintained their own liberty
for many years together by their own forces and Arms: the Swisses are more material than
their Neighbours, and by consequency more free. Of the danger of Mercenary forces, we
have an ancient example in the Carthaginians, who after the end of their first War with the
Romans, had like to have been ruin'd, and overrun by their own Mercenaries, though
their own Citizens commanded them.
After the death of Epaminondas the Thebans made Philip of Macedon their General, who
defeated their Enemies, and enslaved themselves. Upon the death of Duke Philip, the Milanesi
entertained Francesco Sforza against the Venetians, and Francesco, having worsted the Ene|my
at Caravaggio, joyned himself with him, with design to have master'd his Masters,
Francesco's Father was formerly in the service of Ioan Queen of Naples, and on a sudden
marched away from her with his Army, and left her utterly destitute, so that she was
constrain'd to throw her self under the protection of the King of Aragon, and though the
Venetians, and Florentines both, have lately enlarged their Dominion by employing these
forces, and their Generals have rather advanced than enslav'd them; I answer that the Flo|rentines
may impute it to their good fortune, because, of such of their Generals as they
might have rationally feared, some had no Victories to encourage them, others were
obstructed, and others turned their ambition another way; he that was not Victorious was
Giovanni Acuto, whose fidelity could not be known, because he had no opportunity to
break it, but every body knows, had he succeeded, the Florentines had been all at his mercy:
Sforza had always the Bracceschi in opposition, and they were reciprocally an impediment
the one to the other. Francesco turned his ambition upon Lombardy, Braccio upon the
Church, and the Kingdom of Naples. But to speak of more modern occurrences. The
Florentines made Paul Vitelli their General, a wise Man, and one who from a private for|tune
had raised himself to a great reputation: had Paul taken Pisa, no body can be in|sensible
how the Florentines must have comported with him, for should he have quitted
their service, and taken pay of their Enemy, they had been lost without remedy, and to
have continued him in that power, had been in time to have made him their Master. If

the progress of the Venetians be considered, they will be found to have acted securely, and
honorably whilst their affairs were managed by their own forces (which was before they
attempted any thing upon the terra firma) then all was done by the Gentlemen and Com|mon
People of that City, and they did very great things; but when they began to enter|prize
at land, they began to abate of their old reputation and discipline, and to degenerate
into the customs of Italy; and when they began to conquer first upon the Continent, ha|ving
no great territory, and their reputation being formidable abroad, there was no occasi|on
that they should be much afraid of their officers; but afterwards when they began to ex|tend
their Empire, under the command of Carmignola, then it was they became sensible of
their error; for having found him to be a great Captain by their Victories (under his con|duct)
against the Duke of Milan, perceiving him afterwards grow cool and remiss in their
service, they concluded, no more great things were to be expected from him; and being
neither willing, nor indeed able to take away his commission, for fear of losing what
they had got, they were constrain'd for their own security to put him to Death. Their Gene|rals
after him were Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San. Severino, and the Conte de Piti|gliano,
and such as they, under whose conduct the Venetians were more like to lose than
to gain, as it hapned not long after at Vaila, where in one Battel they lost as much as they
had been gaining eight hundred years with incredible labour and difficulty; which is not
strange, if it be considered that by those kind of forces the conquests are slow, and tedious,
and weak; but their losses are rapid and wonderful. And because I am come with my ex|amples
into Italy, where for many years all things have been manag'd by mercenary Ar|mies,
I shall lay my discourse a little higher, that their Original and progress being ren|dred
more plain, they may with more ease be regulated and corrected. You must under|stand
that in latter times when the Roman Empire began to decline in Italy, and the
Pope to take upon him authority in Temporal affairs, Italy became divided into several
States: For many of the great Cities took Arms against their Nobility, who having been
formerly favoured by the Emperours, kept the People under oppression, against which the
Church opposed, to gain to it self a reputation and interest in temporal affairs: other Cities
were subdued by their Citizens who made themselves Princes; so that Italy (upon the tran|slation
of the Empire) being fallen into the hands of the Pope and some other Common|wealths;
and those Priests and Citizens unacquainted with the use and exercise of Arms;
they began to take foreigners into their pay: the first Man who gave reputation to these
kind of forces was Alberigo da Como of Romagna: among the rest Braccio and Sforza (the
two great Arbiters of Italy in their time) were brought up under his discipline, after whom
succeeded the rest who commanded the Armies in Italy to our days: and the end of their
great discipline and conduct was, that Italy was overrun by Charles, pillaged by Lewis,
violated by Ferrand, and defamed by the Swizzers. The order which they observ'd, was
first to take away the reputation from the Foot, and appropriate it to themselves; and this
they did, because their dominion being but small, and to be maintained by their own indu|stry,
a few foot could not do their business, and a great body they could not maintain;
hereupon they changed their Militia into horse, which being digested into Troops they
sustain'd and rewarded themselves with the commands, and by degrees this way of Caval|ry
was grown so much in fashion, that in an Army of 20000 Men, there was scarce 2000
Foot to be found. Besides they endeavour'd with all possible industry to prevent trouble or
fear, either to themselves or their Souldiers, and their way was by killing no body in fight,
only taking one another Prisoners, and dismissing them afterwards without either preju|dice
or ransom. When they were in Leaguer before a Town, they shot not rudely amongst
them in the night, nor did they in the Town disturb them with any sallies in their Camp;
no approaches or intrenchments were made at unseasonable hours, and nothing of lying in
the field when Winter came on; and all these things did not happen by any negligence in
their Officers, but were part of their discipline, and introduc'd (as is faid before) to ease
the poor Souldier both of labour and danger, by which practices they have brought Italy
both into slavery, and contempt.



CHAP. XIII.
Of Auxiliaries, mix'd, and Natural Soldiers.
AUxiliaries (which are another sort of unprofitable Soldiers) are when some potent
Prince is called in to your assistance and defence; as was done not long since by Pope
Iulius, who in his Enterprize of Ferrara having seen the sad experience of his Mercenary
Army, betook himself to auxiliaries, and capitulated with Ferrand King of Spain, that he
should come with his Forces to his relief. These Armies may do well enough for themselves,
but he who invites them, is sure to be a sufferer; for if they be beaten, he is sure to be a
loser, if they succeed, he is left at their discretion; and though ancient Histories are full of
examples of this kind, yet I shall keep to that of Pope Iulius XI, as one still fresh in our
Memory, whose Expedition against Ferrara was very rash and inconsiderate, in that he put
all into the hands of a stranger; but his good fortune presented him with a third accident,
which prevented his reaping the fruit of his imprudent Election; for his subsidiary Troops
being broken at Ravenna, and the Swizzers coming in, and beating off the Victors, beyond
all expectation he escaped being a Prisoner to his Enemies, because they also were de|feated,
and to his Auxiliary friends, because he had conquered by other peoples Arms. The
Florentines being destitute of Soldiers, hired 10000 French for the reduction of Pisa, by
which Counsel they ran themselves into greater danger, than ever they had done in all their
troubles before. The Emperor of Constantinople in opposition to his Neighbors, sent 10000
Turks into Greece, which could not be got out again when the War was at an end, but gave
the first beginning to the servitude and captivity which those Infidels brought upon that
Country. He then who has no mind to overcome, may make use of these Forces, for they
are much more dangerous than the Mercenary, and will ruine you out of hand, because they
are always unanimous, and at the command of other people, whereas the Mercenaries
after they have gotten a Victory, must have longer time, and more occasion before they
can do you a mischief, in respect they are not one body, but made up out of several Coun|tries
entertain'd into your pay, to which if you add a General of your own, they cannot
suddenly assume so much Authority as will be able to do you any prejudice, In short, it is
Cowardize and sloth that is to be feared in the Mercenaries, and courage and activity in the
Auxiliaries. A wise Prince therefore never made use of these Forces, but committed him|self
to his own; choosing rather to be overcome with them, than to conquer with the other,
because, he cannot think that a Victory, which is obtain'd by other peoples Arms. I shall
make no scruple to produce Caesar Borgia for an Example. This Duke invaded Romagna
with an Army of Auxiliaries, consisting wholly of French, by whose assistance he took Imola,
and Furli: But finding them afterwards to totter in their faith, and himself insecure, he
betook himself to Mercenaries, as the less dangerous of the two, and entertained the Ursini
and Vitelli into his pay; finding them also irresolute, unfaithful, and dangerous, he dis|miss'd
them, and for the future employed none but his own. From hence we may collect
the difference betwixt these two sorts of Forces, if we consider the difference in the Dukes
reputation when the Ursini and Vitelli were in his Service, and when he had no Soldiers
but his own: When he began to stand upon his own Legs, his renown began to increase,
and indeed, before, his esteem was not so great, till every body found him absolute Master
of his own Army.
Having begun my Examples in Italy, I am unwilling to leave it, especially whil'st it
supplies us with such as are fresh in our memory; yet I cannot pass by Hiero of Syracuse,
whom I have mentioned before. This person being made General of the Syracusan Army,
quickly discovered the Mercenary Militia was not be relied upon, their Officers being
qualified like ours in Italy, and finding that he could neither continue, not discharge them
securely, he ordered things so, that they were all cut to pieces, and then prosecuted the
War with his own Forces alone, without any foreign assistance. To this purpose the Old
Testament affords us a figure not altogether improper. When David presented himself to
Saul, and offered his Service against Goliah the Champion of the Philistius, Saul to encou|rage
him, accoutred him in his own Arms, but David having tryed them on, excused
himself, pretending they were unfit, and that with them he should not be able to manage
himself; wherefore he desired he might go forth against the Enemy with his own Arms
only, which were his Sling and his Sword. The sum of all is, the Arms of other people
are commonly unfit; and either too wide, or too strait, or too cumbersom.

CHARLES VII. the Father of Lewis XI. having by his Fortune and Courage re|deem'd
his Country out of the hands of the English, began to understand the necessity of
having Soldiers of his own, and erected a Militia at home to consist of Horse as well as Foot,
after which, his Son King Lewis cashiered his own Foot, and took the Swissers into his
pay, which error being followed by his Successors, (as is visible to this day) is the occasion
of all the dangers to which that Kingdom of France is still obnoxious; for having advanced
the reputation of the Swisses he vilified his own people, by disbanding the foot entirely, and
accustoming his Horse so much to engage with other Soldiers, that fighting still in Conjun|ction
with the Swissers, they began to believe they could do nothing without them; Hence
it proceeds that the French are not able to do any thing against the Swisses, and without
them they will venture upon nothing: So that the French Army is mix'd, consists of Mer|cenaries,
and Natives, and is much better than either Mercenaries or Auxiliaries alone, but
much worse than if it were entirely Natural, as this Example testifies abundantly; for
doubtless France would be insuperable, if Charles his Establishment was made use of, and
improv'd: But the imprudence of Man begins many things, which favouring of persent
good, conceal the poyson that is latent, (as I said before of the Hectick Feaver) wherefore
if he who is rais'd to any Soveraignty, foresees not a mischief till it falls upon his head, he
is not to be reckoned a wise Prince, and truly that is a particular blessing of God, bestowed
upon few people: if we reflect upon the first cause of the ruine of the Roman Empire, it
will be found to begin at their entertaining the Goths into their Service, for thereby they
weakened and enervated their own Native courage, and (as it were) transfused it into
them.
I conclude therefore, that without having proper and peculiar forces of his own, no
Prince is secure, but depends wholly upon fortune, as having no Natural and intrinsick
strength to sustain him in adversity: and it was always the opinion, and position of wise
Men, that nothing is so infirm and unstable as the name of Power, not founded upon forces
of its own; those forces are composed of your Subjects, your Citizens, or Servants, all the
rest are either Mercenaries or Auxiliaries, and as to the manner of Ordering and Disciplining
these Domesticks, it will not be hard, if the Orders which I have prescribed be perused,
and the ways considered which Philip the Father of Alexander the Great, and many other
Princes and Republicks have used in the like cases, to which Orders and Establishments I
do wholly refer you.


CHAP. XIV.
The duty of a Prince in relation to his Militia.
A Prince then is to have no other design, nor thought, nor study, but War, and the Arts
and Disciplines of it; for indeed that is the only profession worthy of a Prince, and
is of so much importance, that it not only preserves those who are born Princes in their
patrimonies, but advances men of private condition to that Honorable degree. On the
otherside it is frequently seen when Princes have addicted themselves more to delicacy and
softness, than to Arms, they have lost all, and been driven out of their States; for the prin|cipal
things which deprives or gains a man authority, is the neglect or profession of that
Art: Francesco Sforza by his Experience in War, of a private person made himself Duke
of Milan, and his Children, seeking to avoid the fatigues and incommodities thereof, of
Dukes became private Men; for among other evils and inconveniences which attend when
you are ignorant in War, it makes you contemptible, which is a scandal a Prince ought
with all diligence to avoid, for reasons I shall name hereafter; besides betwixt a potent, and
an impotent, a vigilant and a negligent Prince there is no proportion, it being unreasona|ble
that a Martial and Generous person should be subject willingly to one that is weak and
remiss; or that those who are careless and effeminate, should be safe amongst those who
are Military and Active; for the one is too insolent, and the other too captious, ever to do
any thing well together; so that a Prince unacquainted with the Discipline of War, besides,
other infelicities to which he is expos'd, cannot be beloved by, nor confident in his Armies.
He never therefore ought to relax his thoughts from the Exercises of War, not so much
as in time of Peace, and indeed then he should employ his thoughts more studiously therein,
than in War it self, which may be done two ways, by the application of the body, and the
mind. As to his bodily application, or matter of action, besides that he is obliged to keep
his Armies in good Discipline and Exercise, he ought to inure himself to sports, and by

Hunting and Hawking, and such like recreation, accustom his body to hardship, and hun|ger,
and thirst, and at the same time inform himself of the Coasts and situation of the
Country, the bigness and elevation of the Mountains, the largeness and avenues of the Val|lies,
the extent of the Plains, the Nature of the Rivers and Fens, which is to be done with
great curiosity; and this knowledge is useful two ways; for hereby he not only learns to
know his own Country, and to provide better for its defence, but it prepares and adapts
him, by observing their situations, to comprehend the situations of other Countries, which
will perhaps be necessary for him to discover: For the Hills, the Vales, the Plains, the
Rivers, and the Marshes (for Example) in Tuscany, have a certain similitude and resem|blance
with those in other Provinces; so that by the knowledge of one, we may easily ima|gine
the rest: and that Prince who is defective in this, wants the most necessary qualification
of a General; for by knowing the Country, he knows how to beat up his Enemy; take up
his quarters; March his Armies; Draw up his Men; and besiege a Town with advantage.
In the Character which Historians give of Philopomenes Prince of Achaia, one of his great
Commendations is, that in time of peace he thought of nothing but Military affairs, and
when he was in Company with his Friends in the Country, he would many times stop sud|denly,
and expostulate with them; if the Enemy were upon that Hill, and our Army
where we are, which would have the advantage of the ground? How could we come at
them with most security? if we would draw off, how might we do it best? Or if they
would retreat, how might we follow? so that as he was travelling, he would propose all
the accidents to which an Army was subject; he would hear their opinion, give them his
own, and reinforce it with arguments; and this he did so frequently, that by continual pra|ctice,
and a constant intention of his thoughts upon that business, he brought himself to
that perfection, no accident could happen, no inconvenience could occur to an Army, but
he could presently redress it. But as to the exercise of the mind, a Prince is to do that by
diligence in History, and solemn consideration of the actions of the most Excellent Men;
by observing how they demean'd themselves in the Wars, examining the grounds and rea|sons
of their Victories, and Losses, that he may be able to avoid the one, and imitate the
other; and above all, to keep close to the Example of some great Captain of old (if any
such occurs in his reading) and not only to make him his pattern, but to have all his actions
perpetually in his mind, as it was said Alexander did by Achilles; Caesar by Alexander,
Scipio by Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of Cyrus written by Xenophon, will find how
much Scipio advantaged his renown by that imitation, and how much in modesty, affability,
humanity, and liberality he framed himself to the description which Xenophon had given
him. A wise Prince therefore is to observe all these rules, and never be idle in time of
peace, but employ himself therein with all his industry, that in his adversity he may reap the
fruit of it, and when fortune frowns, be ready to defie her.


CHAP. XV.
Of such things as render Men (especially Princes) worthy of blame,
or applause.
IT remains now that we see in what manner a Prince ought to comport with his Subjects
and friends: and because many have writ of this subject before, it may perhaps seem ar|rogant
in me, especially considering that in my discourse I shall deviate from the opinion of
other Men. But my intention being to write for the benefit and advantage of him who
understands, I thought it more convenient to respect the essential verity, than the ima|gination
of the thing (and many have fram'd imaginary Commonwealths and Govern|ments
to themselves which never were seen, nor had any real existence) for the present
manner of living is so different from the way that ought to be taken, that he who neglects
what is done, to follow what ought to be done, will sooner learn how to ruine, than how
to preserve himself; for a tender Man, and one that desires to be honest in every thing, must
needs run a great hazard among so many of a contrary Principle. Wherefore it is necessa|ry
for a Prince that is willing to subsist, to harden himself, and learn to be good, or other|wise
according to the exigence of his affairs. Laying aside therefore all imaginable no|tions
of a Prince, and discoursing of nothing but what is actually true, I say that all Men
when they are spoken of, especially Princes (who are in a higher and more eminent stati|on)
are remarkable for some quality or other that makes them either honorable or con|temptible.
Hence it is that some are counted liberal, others miserable (according to the

propriety of the Tuscan word Misero, for Quaro in our language is one that desires to ac|quire
by rapine, or any otherway; Misero is he that abstains too much from making use
of his own) some munificent, others rapacious, some cruel, others merciful; some faith|less,
others precise. One poor spirited and effeminate, another fierce and ambitious, one
courteous, another haughty, one modest, another libidinous, one sincere, another cun|ning,
one rugged and morose, another accessible and easie, one grave, another giddy, one
a Devote, and another an Atheist. No man (I am sure) will deny but that it would be an
admirable thing, and highly to be commended to have a Prince endued with all the good
qualities abovesaid; but because it is impossible to have, much less to exercise them all, by
reason of the frailty and crossness of our Nature, it is convenient that he be so well instru|cted
as to know how to avoid the scandal of those Vices which may deprive him of his
State, and be very cautious of the rest, though their consequence be not so pernicious, but
where they are unavoidable, he need trouble himself the less. Again, he is not to concern
himself, if run under the infamy of those Vices without which his Dominion was not to be
preserved; for if we consider things impartially, we shall find some things in appearance are
virtuous, and yet if pursued, would bring certain destruction; and others on the contrary
that are seemingly bad, which if followed by a Prince, procure his peace and security.


CHAP. XVI.
Of Liberality, and Parsimony.
TO begin then with the first of the above-mentioned qualities, I say, it would be advan|tagious
to be accounted liberal; nevertheless liberality so used as not to render you
formidable, does but injure you, for if it be used virtuously, and as it ought to be, it will
not be known, nor secure you from the imputation of its contrary: To keep up therefore the
name of liberal amongst men, it is necessary that no kind of luxury be omitted, so that a
Prince of that disposition will consume his revenue in those kind of expences, and be obliged
at last, if he would preserve that reputation, to become grievous, and a great exactor upon
the people, and do whatever is practicable for the getting of Money, which will cause him
to be hated of his Subjects, and despised by every body else, when he once comes to be
poor, so that offending many with his liberality, and rewarding but few, he becomes sen|sible
of the first disaster, and runs great hazard of being ruined, the first time he is in dan|ger;
which when afterwards he discovers, and desires to remedy; he runs into the other
extream, and grows as odious for his avarice. So then if a Prince cannot exercise this vir|tue
of liberality, so as to be publickly known, without detriment to himself, he ought if he
be wise, not to dread the imputation of being covetous, for in time he shall be esteemed
liberal when it is discovered that by his parsimony he has increased his revenue to a Condi|tion
of defending him against any Invasion, and to enterprize upon other people, without
oppressing of them; so that he shall be accounted Noble to all from whom he takes nothing
away, which are an infinite number; and near and parsimonious only to such few as he gives
nothing to.
In our days we have seen no great action done, but by those who were accounted misera|ble,
the other have been always undone. Pope Lulius XI. made use of his bounty to get
into the Chair, but (to enable himself to make War with the King of France) he never
practised it after, and by his frugality he maintained several Wars without any tax or impo|sition
upon the people, his long parsimony having furnished him for his extraordinary
expences. The present King of Spain, if he had affected to be thought liberal, could never
have undertaken so many great designs, nor obtain'd so many great Victories. A Prince
therefore ought not so much to concern himself (so he exacts not upon his Subjects, so he be
able to defend himself, so he becomes not poor and despicable, nor commits rapine upon
his people) though he be accounted covetous, for that is one of those Vices which fortifies
his Dominion, If any one objects that Caesar by his liberality made his way to the Em|pire,
and many others upon the same score of reputation have made themselves great; I
answer, That you are either actually a Prince, or in a fair way way to be made one. In the
first case liberality is hurtful; in the second, 'tis necessary, and Caesar was one of those who
design'd upon the Empire: But when he was arrived at that dignity, if he had lived, and
not retrenched his Expences, he would have ruined that Empire. If any replys, Many
have been Princes, and with their Armies performed great matters, who have been reputed
liberal, I rejoyn, that a Prince spends either of his own, or his Subjects, or other peoples.

In the first case, he is to be frugal: In the second he may be as profuse as he pleases, and
baulk no point of liberality. But that Prince whose Army is to be maintained with free
quarter, and plunder, and exactions from other people, is obliged to be liberal, or his
Army will desert him; and well he may be prodigal of what neither belongs to him, nor
his Subject, as was the case with Caesar, and Cyrus and Alexander; for to spend upon
anothers stock, rather adds to, than substracts from his reputation, 'tis spending of his
own, that is so mortal, and pernicious. Nor is there any thing that destroys it self like
liberality; for in the use of it, taking away the faculty of using it, thou becomest poor and
contemptible, or to avoid that poverty, thou makest thy self odious and a Tyrant; and
there is nothing of so much importance to a Prince to prevent, as to be either contemptible
or odious, both which depend much upon the prudent exercise of your liberality. Upon
these considerations it is more wisdom to lie under the scandal of being miserable, which
is an imputation rather infamous, than odious, than to be thought liberal, and un your
self into a necessity of playing the Tyrant, which is infamous and odious both.


CHAP. XVII.
Of Cruelty, and Clemency, and whether it is best for a Prince
to be beloved, or feared.
TO come now to the other qualities proposed, I say every Prince is to desire to be
esteemed rather merciful than cruel, but with great caution that his mercy be not
abused; Caesar Borgia was counted cruel, yet that cruelty reduced Romagna, united it,
setled it in peace, and rendered it faithful: so that if well considered, he will appear much
more merciful than the Florentines, who rather than be thought cruel, suffered Pistoia to be
destroyed: A Prince therefore is not to regard the scandal of being cruel, if thereby he
keeps his Subjects in their Allegiance, and united, seeing by some few examples of Justice
you may be more merciful, than they who by an universal exercise of pity, permit several
disorders to follow, which occasion Rapine and Murder; and the reason is, because that
exorbitant mercy has an ill effect upon the whole universality, whereas particular Execu|tions
extend only to particular persons. But among all Princes, a new Prince has the hardest
task to avoid the scandal of being cruel, by reason of the newness of his Government, and
the dangers which attend it: Hence Virgil in the person of Dido excused the inhospitality
of her Government.
Res dura,  regni novitas, metalia cogunt
Moliri,  late fines Custode tueri.
My new Dominion, and my harder fate
Constrains me to't, and I must guard my State.
Nevertheless he is not to be too credulous of reports, too hasty in his motions, nor create
fears and jealousies to himself, but so to temper his administrations with prudence and hu|manity,
that neither too much confidence may make him careless, nor too much diffidence
inrolerable. And from hence arises a new question, Whether it be better to be belov'd than
fear'd, or fear'd than belov'd? It is answered, Both would be convenient, but because that
is hard to attain, it is better and more secure (if one must be wanting) to be fear'd than
belov'd; for in the general, Men are ingrateful, inconstant, hypocritical, fearful of danger,
and covetous of gain; whil'st they receive any benefit by you, and the danger is at distance,
they are absolutely yours, their Blood, their Estates, their Lives, and their Children (as I
said before) are all at your Service, but when mischief is at hand, and you have present need
of their help, they make no scruple to revolt: And that Prince who leaves himself naked of
other preparations, and relies wholly upon their professions, is sure to be ruined; for anity
contracted by price, and not by the greatness and generosity of the mind, may seem a good
pennyworth; yet when you have occasion to make use of it, you will find no such thing.
Moreover Men do with less remorse offend against those who desire to be beloved, than
against those who are ambitious of being feared, and the reason is because Love is fasten'd
only by a ligament of obligation, which the ill Nature of Mankind, breaks upon every occa|sion
that is presented to his profit; But fear depends upon an apprehension of punishment,
which is never to be dispell'd. Yet a Prince is to render himself aweful in such fort, that if

he gains not his Subjects love, he may eschew their hatred; for to be feared and not hated,
are compatible enough, and he may be always in that condition, if he offers no violence to
their Estates, nor attempts any thing upon the honour of their Wifes, as also when he has
occasion to take away any Man's life, if he takes his time when the cause is manifest, and he
has good matter for his justification: But above all things, he is to have a care of intren|ching
upon their Estates, for men do sooner forget the death of their Father, than the loss
of their Patrimony: Besides occasions of confiscation, never fail, and he that gives once
way to that humour of rapine, shall never want temptation to ruine his Neighbor. But
on the contrary, provocations to blood, are more rare, and do sooner evaporate: But
when a Prince is at the head of his Army, and has a multitude of Soldiers to govern, then
it is absolutely necessary not to value the Epithet of cruel, for without that, no Army can
be kept in unity, nor in disposition for any great act.
Among the several instances of Hannibal's great Conduct, it is one, That having a vast
Army, constituted out of several Nations, and conducted to make War in an Enemies
Country, there never hapned any Sedition among them, or any Mutiny against their Ge|neral,
either in his adversity or prosperity: Which can proceed from nothing so probably
as his great cruelty, which, added to his infinite Virtues, rendered him both aweful, and
terrible to his Soldiers, and without that, all his Virtues would have signified nothing.
Some Writers there are (but of little consideration) who admire his great Exploits, and
condemn the true causes of them. But to prove that his other Virtues would never have
carried him thorow, let us reflect upon Scipio, a person Honorable not only in his own
time, but in all History whatever; nevertheless his Army mutined in Spain, and the true
cause of it was, his too much gentleness and lenity, which gave his Soldiers more liberty
than was sutable or consistant with Military Discipline. Fabius Maximus upbraided him
by it in the Senate, and call'd him Corrupter of the Roman Militia; The inhabitants of
Locrus having been plundered and destroyed by one of Scipio's Lieutenants, they were never
redressed, nor the Legat's insolence corrected, all proceeding from the mildness of Scipio's
Nature, which was so eminent in him, that a person undertaking to excuse him in the Se|nate,
declared, that there were many who knew better how to avoid doing ill themselves,
than to punish it in other people. Which temper would doubtless in time have eclipsed
the glory and reputation of Scipio, had that authority been continued in him; but receiving
Orders, and living under the direction of the Senate, that ill quality, was not only not dis|covered
in him, but turned to his renown. I conclude therefore according to what I have
said about being feared, or beloved; That forasmuch as men do love at their own discre|tion,
but fear at their Princes, a wise Prince is obliged to lay his foundation upon that which
is in his own power, not what which depends on other people, but (as I said before) with
great caution that he does not make himself odious.


CHAP. XVIII.
How far a Prince is obliged by his promise.
HOw Honorable it is for a Prince to keep his word, and act rather with integrity than
collusion, I suppose every body understands: Nevertheless Experience has shown in
out times, That those Princes who have not pinn'd themselves up to that punctuality and
preciseness, have done great things, and by their cunning and subtilty not only circum|vented,
and darted the brains of those with whom they had to deal, but have overcome,
and been too hard for those who have been so superstitiously exact. For further explana|tion,
you must understand there are two ways of contending, by Law, and by force: The
first is proper to Men; the second to Beasts; but because many times the first is insufficient,
recourse must be had to the second. It belongs therefore to a Prince to understand both,
when to make use of the rational, and when of the brutal way; and this is recommended
to Princes (though abstrusely) by ancient Writers, who tell them how Achilles and
several other Princes were committed to the Education of Chiron the Centaur, who was to
keep them under his Discipline, choosing them a Master, half Man and half Beast, for no
other reason but to show how necessary it is for a Prince to be acquainted with both, for
that one without the other will be of little duration. Seeing therefore it is of such impor|tance
to a Prince to take upon him the Nature and disposition of a Beast, of all the whole
flock, he ought to imitate the Lyon and the Fox: for the Lyon is in danger of toils and snares,
and the Fox of the Wolf: So that he must be a Fox to find out the snares, and a Lyon to

fright away the Wolves, but they who keep wholly to the Lyon, have no true notion of
themselves. A Prince therefore that is wise and prudent, cannot, nor ought not to keep
his pole, when the keeping of it is to his prejudice, and the causes for which he promised,
removed. Were men all good, this Doctrine was not to be taught, but because they are
wicked, and not likely to be punctual with you, you are not obliged to any such strictness
with them: Nor was their ever any Prince that wanted lawful pretence to justifie his
breach of promise. I might instance in many modern Examples, and shew how many Con|federations,
and Peaces, and Promises have been broken by the infidelity of Princes, and
how he that best personated the Fox, had the better success. Nevertheless it is of great
consequence to disguise your inclination, and to play the Hypocrite well; and men are so
simple in their temper, and so submissive to their present necessities, that he that is neat
and cleanly in his collusions, shall never want people to practise them upon. I
cannot forbear one Example which is still fresh in our memory. Alexander VI. never did, nor
thought of any thing but cheating, and never wanted matter to work upon,  though no man
promised a thing with greater asseveration, nor confirmed it with more oaths and impreca|tions,
and observ'd them less; yet understanding the world well, he never miscarried.
A Prince therefore is not obliged to have all the forementioned good qualities in reality,
but it is necessary he have them in appearance; nay, I will be bold to affirm, that having
them actually, and employing them upon all occasions, they are extreamly prejudicial,
whereas having then only in appearance, they turn to better accompt; it is honorable to
seem mild, and merciful, and courteous, and religious, and sincere, and indeed to be so,
provided your mind be so rectified and prepared that you can act quite contrary upon occa|sion.
And this must be premised, that a Prince, especially if come but lately to the throne,
cannot observe all those things exactly which make men be esteemed virtuous, being often|times
necessitated for the preservation of his State to do things in humane, uncharitable, and
irreligious; and therefore it is convenient his mind be at his command, and flexible to all
the puffs, and variations of his fortune: Not forbearing to be good, whil'st it is in his
choice, but knowing how to be evil when there is a necessity. A Prince then is to have
particular care that nothing falls from his mouth, but what is full of the five qualities afore|said,
and that to see, and to hear him, he appears all goodness, integrity, humanity, and
religion, which last he ought to pretend to more than ordinarily, because more men do
judge by the eye, then by the touch, for every body sees, but few understand; every body
sees how you appear, but few know what in reality you are, and those few dre not, oppose
the opinion of the multitude who have the Majesty of their Prince to defend them; and in
the actions of all men, especially Princes, where no man has power to judge, every one
looks to the end. Let a Prince therefore do what he can to preserve his life, and continue
his Supremacy, the means which he uses shall be thought honorable, and be commended by
every body; because the people are always taken with the appearance, and event of things,
and the greatest part of the world consists of the people: Those few who are wise, taking
place when the multitude has nothing else to rely upon. There is a Prince at this time in
being (but his name I shall conceal) who has nothing in his mouth but fidelity and peace
and yet had he exercised either the one or the other, they had robb'd him before this both of
his power and reputation.


CHAP. XIX.
That Princes ought to be cautious of becoming either odious or contemptible.
ANd because in our discourse of the qualifications of a Prince, we have hitherto spoken
only of those which are of greatest importance, we shall now speak briefly of the rest
under these general heads. That a Prince make it his business (as is partly hinted before)
to avoid such things as may make him odious or contemptible: and as often as he does
that, he plays his part very well, and shall meet no danger or inconveniencies by the rest of
his Vices: Nothing (as I said before) make a Prince so insufferably odious, as usurping
his Subjects Estates, and debauching their Wives, which are two things he ought studiously
to forbear; for whil'st the generality of the world live quietly upon their Estates, and un|prejudiced
in their honor, they live peaceably enough, and all his contention is only with
the pride and ambition of some few persons who are many ways, and with great ease to be
restrained. But a Prince is contemptable when he is counted effeminate, light, unconstant,
pusillanimous, and irresolute; and of this he ought to be as careful, as of a Rock in the Sea,
and strive that his in all actions there may appear magnanimity, courage, gravity, and for|titude,

desiring that in the private affairs of his Subjects, his sentence and determination
may be irrevocable, and himself to stand so in their opinion, that none may think it pos|sible
either to delude or divert him. The Prince who causes himself to be esteemed in that
manner, shall be highly redoubted, and if he be feared, people will not easily conspire
against him, nor readily invade him, because he is known to be an excellent Person and
formidable to his Subjects; for a prince ought to be terrible in two places, at home to his
Subjects, and abroad to his Equals; from whom he defends himself by good Arms, and
good Allies; for if his power be good, his friends will not be wanting, and while his affairs
are fixed at home, there will be no danger from abroad, unless they be disturb'd by some
former conspiracy, and upon any Commotion ab extra, if he be composed at home, has
liv'd as I prescribe, and not deserted himself, he will be able to bear up against any im|pression
according to the example of Nabis the Spartan. When things are well abroad, his
affairs at home will be safe enough, unless they be perplexed by some secret Conspiracy,
against which the Prince sufficiently provides, if he keeps himself from being hated or de|spised,
and the people remain satisfied of him, which is a thing very necessary, as I have
largely inculcated before. And one of the best Remedies Prince can use against conspiracy, is
to keep himself from being hated or despised by the multitude; for no body pts, but he
expects by the death of the Prince, to gratifie the people, and the thought of offending
them will deter him from any such Enterprize, because in conspiracies the difficulties are
infinite. By experience we find that many conjurations have been on foot, but few have
succeeded, because no man can conspire alone: nor choose a Confederate but out of those
who are discontented, and no sooner shall you impart your mind to a Male-content, but
you give him opportunity to reconcile himself, because there is nothing he proposes to him|self,
but he may expect from the discovery. So that the gain being certain on that side,
and hazardous and uncertain on the other, he must be either an extraordinary friend to
you, or an implacable Enemy to the Prince if he does not betray you; In short, on the side,
of the Conspirators there is nothing but fear, and jealousie, and apprehension of punishment,
but one the Princes side there is the Majesty of the Government, the Laws, the Assistance of
his Friends and State, which defend him so effectually, that if the affections of the people
be added to them, no man can be so rash, and precipitate as to conspire; for if before the
execution of his design, the Conspirator has reason to be afraid, in this case he has much
more afterwards, having offended the people in the Execution, and left himself no refuge
to fly to. Of this many Examples might be produced, but I shall content my self with one
which happened in the memory of our Fathers. Hanibal Bentivgli (Grandfather to this
present Hanibal) was Prince of Bolonia, and killed by the Canneschi who conspired against
him; none of his race being left behind, but Iohn who was then in his Cradle: The Mur|ther
was no sooner committed, but the people took Arms, and slew all the Canneschi, which
proceeded only from the affection that the House of the Bentivogli had at that time among
the populacy in Bolonia, which was then so great, that when Hanibal was dead, there being
none of that Family remaining, in a capacity for the Government of the State, upon infor|mation
that at Florence there was a Natural Son of the said Bentivogli's (who till that time
had passed only for the Son of a smith) they sent Embassadors for him, and having condu|cted
him honorably to that City, they gave him the Government, which he executed very
well, till the said Iohn came of Age. I conclude therefore a Prince need not be much appre|hensive
of Conspiracies, whil'st the people are his friends; but when they are dissatisfied,
and have taken a prejudice against him, there is no thing, nor no person which he ought
not to fear. And it has been the constant care of all wise Princes, and all well-governed
States, not to reduce the Nobility to despair, nor the people to discontent, which is one of
the most material things a Prince is to prevent. Among the best ordered Monarchies of
our times, France is one, in which there are many good Laws and Constitutions tending
to the liberty and preservation of the King: The first of them is the Parliament, and the
Authority wherewith it is invested; for he who was the founder of that Monarchy, being
sensible of the ambition and insolence of the Nobles, and judging it convenient to have
them bridled and restrained; and knowing on the other side the hatred of the people against
the Nobility, and that it proceeded from fear (being willing to secure them) to exempt the
King from the displeasure of the Nobles, if he sided with the Commons, or from the malice
of the commons, if he inclined to the Nobles, he erected a third judge, which (without
any reflexion upon the King, should keep the Nobility under, and protect the people; nor
could there be a better order, wiser, nor of greater security to the King and the Kingdom;
from whence we may deduce another observation, That Princes are to leave things of injustice
and envy to the Ministery and Execution of others, but acts of favour and grace are to be per|form'd
by themselves. To conclude, a Prince is to value his Grandees, but so as not to make the
people hate him.

Contemplating the lifes and deaths of several of the Roman Emperors, it is possible many
would think to find plenty of Examples quite contrary to my opinion, forasmuch as some of
them whose Conduct was remarkable, and Magnanimity obvious to every body, were
turn'd out of their Authority, or murthered by the Conspiracy of their subjects. To give
a punctual answer, I should inquire into the qualities and conversations of the said Empe|rors,
and in so doing I should find the reason of their ruine to be the same, or very conso|nant
to what I have opposed. And in part I will represent such things as are most notable,
to the consideration of him that reads the actions of our times, and I shall content my self
with the examples of all the Emperors which succeeded in the Empire from Marcus the
Philosopher, to Maximinus, and they were, Marcus, his Son Commodus, Pertinax, Iulian,
Severus, Antoninus, his Son Caracalla, Macrinus, Heligabalus, Alexander, and Maxi|minus.
It is first to be considered, That whereas in other Governments there was nothing to
contend with, but the ambition of the Nobles, and the insolence of the people, the Roman
Emperors had a third inconvenience, to support against, the avarice and cruelty of the
Soldiers, which was a thing of such difficult practice, that it was the occasion of the destru|ction
of many of them, it being very uneasie to please the Subject and the Soldier together;
for the Subject loves Peace, and chooses therefore a Prince that is gentle and mild, whereas the
Soldier prefers a Martial Prince, and one that is haughty, and rigid, ad rapacious, which
good qualities they are desirous he should exercise upon the people, that their pay might be
encreased: and their covetousness and cruelty satiated upon them. Hence it is, That those
Emperors, who neither by Art, nor Nature are endued with that address, and reputation
as is necessary for the restraining both of the one and the other, do always miscarry; and
of them the greatest part (especially if but lately advanced to the Empire) understanding
the inconsistancy of their two humors, incline to satisfie the Soldiers, without regarding
how far the people are disobliged. Which Council is no more than is necessary; for seeing
it cannot be avoided but Princes must fall under the hatred of somebody, they ought dili|gently
to contend that it be not of the multitude; If that be not to be obtain'd, their next
great care is to be, that they incur not the odium of such as are most potent among them:
And therefore those Emperors who were new, and had need of extraordinary support,
adhered more readily to the Soldiers than to the people which turn'd to their detriment or
advantage, as the Prince knew how to preserve his reputation with them: From the causes
aforesaid, it hapned that Marcus Aurelius, Pertinax, and Alexander being Princes of more
than ordinary Modesty, lovers of Justice, Enemies of cruelty, courteous, and bountiful,
came all of them (except Marcus) to unfortunate ends. Marcus indeed lived and died
in great honour, because he came to the Empire by way of inheritance and succession,
without being beholden either to Soldiers or people, and being afterwards indued with
many good qualities which recommended him, and made him venerable among them, he
kept them both in such order whil'st he liv'd, and held them so exactly to their bounds, that
he was never either hated or despised. But Pertinax was chosen Emperor against the will
of the Soldiers, who being used to live licentiously under Commodus, they could not brook
that regularity to which Pertinax endeavoured to bring them; so that having contracted
the Odium of the Soldiers, and a certain disrespect and neglect by reason of his Age, he was
ruined in the very beginning of his reign; from whence it is observable, that hatred is ob|tained
two ways, by good works, and bad, and therefore a Prince (as I said before) being
willing to retain his jurisdiction, is oftentimes compelled to be bad. For if the chief par|ty,
(whether it be people, or army, or Nobility) which you think most useful, and of
most consequence to you for the conservation of your dignity, be corrupt, you must follow
their humour and indulge them, and in that case honesty and virtue are pernicious.
But let us come to Alexander who was a Prince of such great equity and goodness, it is
reckoned among his praises that in the fourteen years of his Empire, there was no man
put to death without a fair Tryal: Nevertheless being accounted effeminate, and one that
suffered himself to be managed by his Mother. and falling by that means into disgrace, the
Army conspired and killed him. Examining on the other side the Conduct of Commodus,
Severus, Antoninus, Caracalla, and Maziminus, you will find them cruel and rapacious
and such as to satisfie the Soldiers, omitted no kind of injury that could be exercised against
the people, and all of them but Severus were unfortunate in their ends: for Severus was a
Prince of so great courage and magnanimity, that preserving the friendship of the Army
(though the people were oppressed) he made his whole Reign happy, his virtues having
represented him so admirable both to the Soldiers and people, that these remained in a man|ner
stupid, and astonished, and the other obedient and contented. And because the actions
of Severus were great in a new Prince, I shall shew in brief how he personated of the Fox

and the Lyon, whose Natures and properties are (as I said before) necessary for the imita|tion
of a Prince. Severus therefore, knowing the laziness and inactivity of Iulian the
Emperor, persuaded the Army under his Command in Sclavonia to go to Rome, and
revenge the death of Pertinax who was murthered by the Imperial Guards; and under that
colour, without the least pretence to the Empire, he marched his Army towards Rome,
and was in Italy before any thing of his motion was known: being arrived at Rome, the
Senate were afraid of him, killed Iulian, and elected Severus. After which beginning,
there remained two difficulties to be removed before he could be Master of the whole Em|pire;
The one was in Asia, where Niger General of the Asiatick Army, had proclaimed
himself Emperor: The other, in the west, where Albinus the General aspired to the
same: and thinking it hazardous to declare against both, he resolved to oppose himself
against Niger, and cajole and wheedle Albinus, to whom he writ word, That being chosen
Emperor by the Senate, he was willing to receive him to a participation of that dignity,
gave him the title of Caesar, and by consent of the Senate admitted him his Collegue; which
Albinus embraced very willingly, and thought him in earnest; but when Severus had over|come
Niger, put him to death, and setled the affairs of the East, being returned to Rome,
he complained in the Senate against Albinus, as a person, who contrary to his obligations
for the benefits received from him, had endeavoured treacherously to murther him, told
them that he was obliged to march against him to punish his ingratitude, and afterwards
following him into France, he executed his design, deprived him of his Command, and
put him to death. He then who strictly examines the Actions of this Prince, will find him
fierce as a Lyon, subtile as a Fox, feared and reverenced by every body, and no way odious
to his Army: Nor will it seem strange that he (though newly advanced to the Empire)
was able to defend it, seeing his great reputation protected him against the hatred which
his people might have conceived against him by reason of his Rapine. But his Son Anto|ninus
was an excellent person likewise endued with transcendant parts, which rendered
him admirable to the people, and grateful to the Soldiers; for he was Martial in his Na|ture,
patient of labour and hardship, and a great despiser of all sensuality and softness,
which recommended him highly to his Armies. Nevertheless his fury and cruelty was so
immoderately great (having upon several private and particular occasions, put a great part
of the people of Rome, and all the inhabitants of Alexandria, to death) that he fell into the
hatred of the whole world, and began to be feared by his Confidents that were about him, so
that he was killed by one of his Captains in the middle of his Camp. From whence it may
be observed, That these kind of Assassinations which follow upon a deliberate and obstinate
resolution, cannot be prevented by a Prince, for he who values not his own life, can commit
them when he pleases; but they are to be feared the less, because they happen but seldom,
he is only to have a care of doing any great injury to those that are about him, of which
error Antoninus was too guilty having put the Brother of the said Captain to an ignomi|nious
death, threatned the Captain daily, and yet continued him in his Guards, which
was a rash and pernicious act, and prov'd so in the end. But to come to Commodus, who
had no hard task to preserve his Empire, succeeding to it by way of inheritance, as Son to
Marcus, for that to satisfie the people, and oblige the Soldiers, he had no more to do, but
to follow the footsteps of his Father. But being of a brutish and cruel disposition, to exer|cise
his rapacity upon the people, he indulged his Army, and allowed them in all manner of
licentiousness. Besides, prostituting his Dignity, by descending many times upon the
Theater to fight with the Gladiators, and committing many other acts which were vile,
and unworthy the Majesty of an Emperor, he became contemptible to the Souldiers, and
growing odious to one party, and despicable to the other, they conspired and murthered
him. Maximinus was likewise a Martial Prince, and addicted to the Wars, and the Army
being weary of the Effeminacy of Alexander (whom I have mentioned before) having slain
him, they made Maximinus Emperor, but he possessed it not long, for two things contri|buted
to make him odious, and despised. One was the meanness of his extraction, having
kept sheep formerly in Thrace, which was known to all the world, and made him univer|sally
contemptable. The other was, that at his first coming to the Empire, by not repairing
immediately to Rome, and putting himself into possession of his Imperial seat, he had con|tracted
the imputation of being cruel, having exercised more than ordinary severity by his
Prefects in Rome, and his Lieutenants in all the rest of the Empire; so that the whole world
being provoked, by the vileness of his birth, and detestation of his cruelty, in apprehension
of his fury, Africa, the Senate and all the people both in Italy and Rome, conspired against
him, and his own Army joyning themselves with them, in their Leaguer before Aquileia
finding it difficult to be taken, weary of his cruelties, and encouraged by the multitude of
his Enemies, they set upon him, and slew him.

I will not trouble my self with Heliogabalus, Macrinus, nor Iulian, who being all
effeminate and contemptible, were quickly extinguished. But I shall conclude this discourse,
and say that the Princes of our times are not obliged to satisfie the Soldiers in their respective
Governments by such extraordinary ways; for though they are not altogether to be neg|lected,
yet the remedy and resolution is easie because none of these Princes have entire Ar|mies,
brought up, and inveterated in their several Governments and Provinces, as the Ar|mies
under the Roman Empire were. If therefore at that time it was necessary to satisfie
the Soldiers rather than the people, it was because the Soldiers were more potent. At
present it is more the interest of all Princes (except the great Turk and the Soldan) to com|ply
with the people, because they are more considerable than the Soldiers. I except the
Turk, because he has in his Guards 12000 Foot, and 15000 Horse constantly about him,
upon whom the strength and security of his Empire depends, and it is necessary (post|poning
all other respect to the people) they be continued his freinds. It is the same case
with the Soldan, who being wholly in the power of the Soldiers, it is convenient that he
also wave the people, and insinuate with the Army. And here it is to be noted, that this
Government of the Soldans is different from all other Monarchies, for it is not unlike the
Papacy in Christendom, which can neither be called a new, nor an hereditary Principality,
because the Children of the deceased Prince, are neither Heirs to his Estate, nor Lords of
his Empire, but he who is chosen to succeed, by those who have the faculty of Election;
which Custom being of old, the Government cannot be called new, and by consequence is
not subject to any of the difficulties wherewith a new one is infested; because though the
person of the Prince be new, and perhaps the Title; yet the Laws and Orders of State are
old, and disposed to receive him as if he were hereditary Lord. But to return to our
business, I say, That whoever considers the aforesaid discourse, shall find either hatred or
contempt the perpetual cause of the ruine of those Emperors, and be able to judge how it
came about that part of them taking one way in their administrations, and part of them
another, in both parties some were happy, and some unhappy at last. Pertinax and Alex|ander
being but Upstart Princes, it was not only vain, but dangerous for them to imitate
Marcus, who was Emperor by right of Succession. Again, it was no less pernicious for
Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to make Severus their pattern, not having force
nor vertue enough to follow his footsteps. So then if a new Prince cannot imitate the actions
of Marcus; (and to regulate by the example of Severus, is unnecessary) he is only to take
that part from Severus that is necessary to the foundation of his State, and from Marcus, what
is convenient to keep and defend it gloriously, when 'tis once established and firm.


CHAP. XX.
Whether Citadels, and other things which Princes many times do,
be profitable, or dangerous?
SOme Princes for the greater security of their Dominion, have disarmed their Subjects;
others have cantonized their Countries; others have fomented factions and animosity
among them; some have applyed themselves to flatter and insinuate with those who were
suspicious in the beginning of their Government: Some have built Castles, others have
demolished them; and though in all these cases, no certain or determined rule can be pre|scribed,
unless we come to a particular consideration of the State where it is to be used; yet
I shall speak of them all, as the matter it self will endure. A wise Prince therefore was
never known to disarm his Subjects; rather finding them unfurnished, he put Arms into
their hands; for by arming them, and inuring them to warlike Exercise, those Arms are
surely your own; they who were suspicious to you, become faithful; they who are faithful,
are confirm'd; and all your Subjects become of your party; and because the whole multi|tude
which submits to your Government is not capable of being armed, if you be beneficial
and obliging to those you do arm, you may make the bolder with the rest; for the difference
of your behaviour to the Soldier, binds him more firmly to your Service; and the rest will
excuse you, as judging them most worthy of reward, who are most liable to danger. But
when you disarm, you disgust them, and imply a diffidence in them, either for cowardize,
or Treachery, and the one or the other is sufficient to give them an impression of hatred
against you. And because you cannot subsist without Soldiers, you will be forced to enter|tain
Mercenaries, whom I have formerly described, and if it were possible for the said
Mercenaries to be good, they could not be able to defend you against powerful Adver|saries,

and Subjects disobliged. Wherefore (as I have said) a new Prince, in his new
Government, puts his Subjects always into Arms, as appears by several Examples in Hi|story.
But when a Prince conquers a new State, and annexes it (as a Member) to his
old, then it is necessary your Subjects be disarmed, all but such as appeared for you in the
Conquest, and they are to be mollified by degrees, and brought into such a condition of
laziness and effeminacy, that in time your whole strength may devolve upon your own Na|tural
Militia, which were trained up in your ancient Dominion, and are to be always about
you. Our Ancestors (and they were esteemed wise men) were wont to say, That it
was necessary to keep Pistoa by factions, and Pisa by fortresses, and accordingly in several
Towns under their Subjection, they created, and fomented factions and animosities, to
keep them with more ease. This, at a time when Italy was unsetled, and in a certain kind
of suspence, might be well enough done, but I do not take it at this time for any precept for
us, being clearly in opinion that the making of factions, never does good, but that where
the Enemy approaches, and the City is divided, it must necessarily, and that suddenly be
lost, because the weaker party will always fall off to the Enemy, and the other cannot be
able to defend it. The Venetians, (as I guess) upon the same grounds nourished the factions
of the Guelfs, and the Ghibilins in the Cities under their jurisdiction; and though they
kept them from blood; yet they encouraged their dissentions, to the end that the Citizens
being employed among themselvs, should have no time to conspire against them; which
as appeared afterwards, did not answer expectation; for being defeated at Valia, one of the
said factions took Arms, and turned the Venetians out of their State. Such methods there|fore
as these, do argue weakness in the Prince; for no Government of any strength or con|sistance
will suffer such divisions, because they are useful only in time of Peace, when per|haps
they may contribute to the more easie management of their Subjects, but when War
comes, the fallacy of those Counsels are quickly discovered, Without doubt, Princes grow
great when they overcome the difficulties and impediments which are given them; and
therefore Fortune, especially when she has a mind to exalt a new Prince (who has greater
need of reputation than a Prince that is old and Hereditary) raises him up Enemies, and
encourages enterprizes against him, that he may have opportunity to conquer them, and
advance himself by such steps as his Enemies had prepared. For which reason many have
thought that a wise Prince when opportunity offers, ought (but with great cunning and
address) to maintain some enmity against himself, that when time serves to destroy them,
his own greatness may be encreas'd.
Princes, and particularly those who are not of long standing, have found more fidelity
and assistance from those whom they suspected at the beginning of their Reign, than from
them who at first were their greatest confidents. Pandolfus Petrucci Prince of Sienna govern'd
his State rather by those who were suspected, than others. But this is not to be treated of
largely, because it varies according to the subjects; I shall only say this, That those Men
who in the beginning of his Government, opposed him (if they be of so such quality as to
want the support of other people) are easily wrought over to the Prince, and more strictly
engaged to be faithful; because they knew that it must be their good carriage for the future
that must cancel the prejudice that is against them; and so the Prince comes to receive more
benefit by them, than by those who serving him more securely, do most commonly neglect
his affairs.
And seeing the matter requires, I will not omit to remind a Prince who is but newly
advanced (and that by some inward favour and correspondence in the Country) that he
considers well what it was that disposed those parties to befreind him; if it be not affection
to him, but Pique, and animosity to the old Government, it will cost much trouble and
difficulty to keep them his friends, because it will be impossible to satisfie them: and upon
serious disquisition, Ancient and Modern Examples will give us the reason, and we shall
find it more easie to gain such persons as were satisfied with the former Government,
and by consequence his Enemies, than those who being disobliged, sided with him, and
assisted to subvert it.
It has been a Custom among Princes, for the greater security of their Territories to build
Citadels and Fortresses to bridle and restrain such as would enterprize against them, and to
serve as a refuge in times of Rebellion; and I approve the way because anciently practised,
yet no longer ago than in our days, Mr. Nicolo Vitelli was known to dismantle two Forts in
the City of Castello, to secure his Government; Guidobaldo Duke of Urbin returning to his
State from whence Caesar Borgia had driven him, demolished all the strong places in that
Province, and thereby thought it more unlikely again to fall into the hands of the Enemy.
The Bentivogli being returned to Bologna, used the same course: So that Fortresses, are
useful, or not useful, according to the difference of time, and if in one place they do good,

they do as much mischief in another: And the case may be argued thus, That Prince who
is more afraid of his Subjects than Neighbours, is to suffer them to stand: The Family of
the Sforza's, has and will suffer more mischief by the Castle of Milan (which ws built by
Francesco Sforza) than by all its other troubles whatever; so that the best fortification of
all, is not to be hated by the people, for your Fortresses will not protect you, if the people
have you in detestation, because they shall no sooner take Arms, but Strangers will fall in,
and sustain them. In our times, there is not one instance to be produced, of advantage,
which that course has brought to any Prince, but to the Countess of Furly, when upon the
Death of Hiernimo her Husband, by means of those Castles she was able to withstand the
popular fury, and expect till supplies came to her from Milan, and resetled her in the Go|vernment;
and as times then stood, the people were not in a Condition to be relieved by
any stranger. But afterwards they stood her in no stead when Caesar Borgia invaded her,
and the people being incensed, joyned with her Enemy. Wherefore it had been better for
her both then, and at first to have possessed the affections of the people, than all the Castles
in the Country. These things being considered, I approve both of him that builds those
Fortresses, and of him that neglects them, but must needs condemn him who relies so much
upon them, as to despise the displeasure of the people.


CHAP. XXI.
How a Prince is to demean himself to gain reputation.
NOthing recommends a Prince so highly to the world, as great Enterprizes, and noble
Expressions of his own Valor and Conduct. We have in our days Ferdinand King
of Aragon, the present King of Spain, who may (and not improperly) be called a new
Prince, being of a small and weak King, become for fame, and renown the greatest Monarch
in Christendom; and if his Exploits be considered, you will find them all brave, but some
of them extraordinary. In the beginning of his Reign he invaded the Kingdom of Granada,
and that Enterprize was the foundation of his Grandeur. He began it leisurely, and with|out
suspicion of impediment, holding the Barons of Castile employed in that service, and
so intent upon that War, that they dreamt not of any Innovation, whil'st in the mean time
before they were aware, he got reputation, and Authority over them. He found out a way
of maintaining his Army at the expence of the Church, and the people, and by the length
of that War, to establish such Order and Discipline among his Soldiers, that afterwards they
gained him many honourable Victories. Beside this, to adapt him for greater Enterprizes,
(always making Religion his pretence) by a kind of devout cruelty, he destroyed and exter|minated
the jews called Marrani, than which nothing could be more strange, or deplorable.
Under the same Cloak of Religion, he invaded Affrica, made his Expedition into Italy,
assaulted France, and began many great things which always kept the minds of his Subjects
in admiration and suspence, expecting what the event of his Machinations would be. And
these his Enterprizes had so sudden a spring and result one from the other, that they gave
no leisure to any man to be at quiet, or to continue any thing against him. It is likewise
of great advantage to a Prince to give some rare Example of his own administration at
home (such is reported of Messer Bernardo da Milano) when there is occasion for some body
to perform any thing Extraordinary in the Civil Government, whether it be good or bad,
and to find out such a way either to reward or punish him, as may make him much talk'd of
in the world. Above all, a Prince is to have a care in all his actions to behave himself so
as may give him the reputation of being excellent as well as great. A Prince is likewise
much esteemed when he shows himself a sincere friend, or a generous Enemy, That is when
without any hesitation he declares himself in favour of one against another, which as it is
more frank and Princely, so it is more profitable than to stand neuter; for if two of your
potent Neighbours be at Wars, they are either of such condition that you are to be afraid of
the Victor or not: In either which cases it will be always more for your benefit to disco|ver
your self freely, and make a fair War: For in the first cause, if you do not declare, you
shall be a prey to him who overcomes, and it will be a pleasure, and satisfaction to him that
is conquered to see you his Fellow-sufferer, nor will any body either defend, or receive you,
and the reason is, because the Conqueror will never understand them to be his Friends, who
would not assist him in his distress; and he that is worsted will not receive you, because you
neglected to run his fortune with your Arms in your hands. Antiochus, upon the invita|tion
of the Etolians, passed into Greece, to repel the Romans: Antiochus sent Embassa|dors

to the Achaians (who were in amity with the Romans) to persude them a Neu|trality,
and the Romans sent to them to associate with them. The busines coming to be
debatedin the Council of the Achaians, and Antiochus his Embassador pressing them to be
Neuters; The Roman Embassador replyed, As to what he has remonstrated, That it is
most useful and most consistent with the interest of your State, not to engage your selves
in our War, their is nothing more contrary aud pernicious; for if you do not concern
your selves, you will assuredly become a prey to the Conqueror without any thanks or
reputation; and it will always be, that he who has least kindness for you, will tempt you
to be Neuters, but they that are your friends will invite you to take up Arms. And those
Princes who are ill advised, to avoid some present danger follow the Neutral way, are most
commonly ruin'd: But when a Prince discovers himself couragiously, in favour of one
party, if he with whom you joyn overcome, though he be very powerful, and you seem to
remain at his discretion, yet he is obliged to you, and must needs have a respect for you, and
Men are not so wicked, with such signal and exemplary ingratitude to oppress you. Besides
Victories are never so clear and compleat, as to leave the Conqueror without all sparks of
reflexion, and especially upon what is just. But if your Confederate comes by the worst,
you are received by him, and assisted whil'st he is able, and becomest a Companion of his
fortune, which may possibly restore the. In the second place, if they who contend be of
such condition, that they have no occasion to fear, let which will overcome; you are in pur|dence
to declare your self the sooner, because by assisting the one, you contribute to the ruine
of the other, (whom, if your Confederate had been wise, he oughtrather to have preserved)
so that he overcoming, remains wholly at your discretion, and by your assistance, he must
of necessity overcome. And hear it is to be noted (if he can avoid it) a Prince is never to
league himself with another more powerful than himself, in an offensive War: because in
that case, if he overcomes, you remain at his mercy, and Princes ought to be as cautious as
possible, of falling under the discretion of other people. The Venetians (when there was no
necessity for it) associated with France against the Duke of Milan, and that association was
the cause of their ruine: But where it is not to be avoided (as hapned to the Florentines
when the Pope and the Spaniard sent their Armies against Lombardy) there a Prince is to
adhere for the reasons aforesaid. Nor is any Prince of Government to imagine that in those
cases any certain counsel can be taken, because the affairs of this world are so ordered, that
in avoiding one mischief, we fall commonly into another. But a Man's wisdom is most
conspicuous where he is able to distinguish of dangers, and make choice of the least. More|over
a Prince to show himself a Virtuoso, and Honourer of all that is excellent in any Art
whatsoever. He is likewise to encourage and assure his Subjects that they may live quietly
in peace and exercise themselves in their several Vocations whether marchandize, Agri|culture,
or any other employment whatever, to the end that one may not forbear improing
or imbellishing his Estate for fear it should be taken from him, nor another advancing his
Trade in apprehension of taxes; but the Prince is rather to excite them by propositions of
reward, and immunities to all such as shall any way amplifie his Territory, or powers. He
is obliged likewise, at convenient times in the year to entertain the people by Feastings and
Plays, and Spectacles of Recreation; and because all Cities divided into Companies, or
Wards, he ought to have respect to those Societies, be merry with them sometimes, and
give them some instance of his humanity, and magnificence, but always retaining the Ma|jesty
of his degree, which is never to be debased in any case whatever.


CHAP. XXII.
of the Secretaries of Princes.
THe Election of his Ministers, is of no small importance to a Prince; for the first judg|ment
that is made of him, or his parts, is from the persons he has about him; when
they are wise and faithful, be sure the Prince is discreet himself, who as he knew how to
choose them able at first, so he has known how to oblige them to be faithful; but when his
Ministers are otherwise, it reflects shrewdly upon the Prnice; for commonly the first error
he commits, is in the Election of his Servants. No Man knew Antonio da Vanafro to be
Secretary to Pandolfo Petrucci Prince of Sienna but he could judge Pandolfo to be aprudent
Man for choosing such a one to his Minister. In the capacities and parts of Men, there are
three sorts of degrees; one Man understands of himself; another understands what is ex|plained;
and a third understands neither of himself, nor by any Explanation: The first is

excellent, the second commendable, the third altogether unprofitable. If therefore Pan|dolfus
was not in the first rank, he might be concluded in the second; for whenever a
Prince  the judgment to know the good, and the bad of what is spoken or done, though
his own invention be not excellent, he can distinguish a good servant from a bad, and exalt
the one, and correct the other, and the Minister despairing of deluding him, remains good
in spight of his teeth. But the business is how a Prince may understand his Minister, and
the rule for that is infallible. When you observe your Officer more careful of himself, than
of you, and all his actions and designs pointing at his own interest and advantage, that
Man will never be a good Minister, nor ought you ever to repose any confidence in him;
for he who has the affairs of his Prince in his hand, ought to lay aside all thoughts of him|self,
and regard nothing but what is for the profit of his Master. And on the otherside, to
keep him faithful, the Prince is as much concerned to do for him, by honouring him, en|riching
him, giving him good Offices and Preferments, that the wealth and honour confer|red
by his Master, may keep him from looking out for himself, and the plenty and goodness
of his Offices, make him afraid of a change, knowing that without his Princes favour he
can never subsist. When therefore the Prince, and the Minister are qualified in this manner,
they may depend one upon the other: But when 'tis otherwise with them, the end must be
bad; and one of them will be undone.


CHAP. XXIII.
How flatterers are to be avoided.
I Will not pass by a thing of great consequence, being an error against which Princes do
hardly defend themselves, unless they be very wise, and their judgment very good.
And that is about Flatterers, of which kind of Cattle all Histories are full; for Men are
generally so fond of their own actions, and so easily mistaken in them, that it is not with|out
difficulty they defend themselves against those sort of people, and he that goes about to
defend himself, runs a great hazard of being despised: For there is no other remedy against
Flatterers, than to let every body understand you are not disobliged by telling the truth;
yet if you suffer every body to tell it, you injure your self, and lessen your reverence.
Wherefore a wise Prince ought to go a third way, and select out of his State certain discreet
men, to whom only he is to commit that liberty of speaking truth, and that, of such things
as he demands, and nothing else; but then he is to inquire of every thing, hear their
opinions, and resolve afterwards, as he pleases, and behave himself towards them in such
sort, that every one may find with how much the more freedom he speaks, with so much
the more kindness he is accepted; That besides them, he will hearken to no body; That
he considers well before he resolves; and that his resolutions once taken, are never to be
altered: He that does otherwise, shall either precipitate his affairs by means of his Flatterers;
or by variety of advices, often change his designs, which will lessen his esteem, and render
him contemptible. To This purpose I shall instance in one Modern Example.
Father Lucas, a Servant to Maximilian the present Emperor, giving a Character of His
Majesty, declared him a person that never consulted any body, and yet never acted accor|ding
to his own judgment and inclination; and the reason was, because he proceeded con|trary
to the presriptions aforesaid, for the Emperor is a close Man, communicates his
secrets with no body, nor takes any man's advice; but when his determinations are to be
executed, and begin to be known in the world, those who are about him begin to discourage
and dissuade him, and he being good natur'd does presently desist: Hence it comes to
pass that his resolutions of one day, are dissolved in the next, no man knows what he desires
or designs; nor no man can depend upon his resolutions. A Prince therefore is always to
consult; but at his own, not other peoples pleasure, and rather to deter people from giving
their advice undemanded; but he ought not to be sparing in his demands, nor when he has
demanded, impatient of hearing the truth; but if he understands that any suppressed it,
and forbore to speak out, for fear of displeasing, then, and not till then, he is to show his
displeasure. And because there are those who believe that a Prince which creates an opinion
of his prudence in the people, does it not by any excellence in his own Nature, but by the
Counsels of those who are about him; without doubt they are deceived; for this is a gene|ral
and infallible rule, That that Prince who has no Wisdom of his own, can never be well ad|vised;
unless by accident he commits all to the Government and Administration of some
honest and discreet man: In this case 'tis possible things may be well ordered for a while,

but they can never continue; for his Minister or Vicegerent in a short time will set up for
himself; but if a Prince who has no great judgment of his own, consults with more than
one; their Counsels will never agree, nor he have ever the cunning to unite them; Every
man will advise according to his own interest, or Capriccio, and he not have the parts
either to correct or discover it: And other Counsellors are not to be found, for men will
always prove bad, unless by necessity they are compelled to be good. So then it is clear,
That good Counsels (from whomsoever they come) proceed rather from the Wisdom of the
Prince, than the Princes Wisdom from the goodness of his Counsels.


CHAP. XXIV.
How it came to pass that the Princes of Italy have most of
them lost their Dominions.
THE Qualities aforesaid being observed; they make a new Prince appear in the number
of the more Ancient, and render him presently more firm and secure in his Govern|ment,
than if he had descended to it by right of inheritance; for the Actions of a new
Prince are liable to stricter observation, than if he were Hereditary, and when they are
known to be virtuous, gain more upon people, and oblige them farther than antiquity of
Blood; because Men are more affected with present, than pass'd things, and when in their
present condition they find themselves well, they content themselves with it, without looking
out any where else, employing themselves wholly in defence of their Prince, unless in other
things he be defective to himself: So that thereby he will have double honor, in having
laid the foundation of a new Principality, and embellished and fortified it, with good
Laws, good Force, good Friends, and good Example: whereas he multiplies his disgrace,
who being born Prince, loses his inheritance by his own ill management and imprudence.
And if the Soveraign Princes in Italy, who in our time have lost their Dominions, be con|sidered,
as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and others, there will be found in
their beginning one common defect as to the management of their Arms, for the reasons
largely discours'd of before: besides some of them will appear to have been hated by the
people, or if they have had so much prudence as to preserve a friendship with them, they
have been ignorant how to secure themselves against the Grandees; for without these errors
no States are lost that have Money and strength enough to bring an Army into the Field.
Philip of Macedon (not Alexander the Great's Father, but he who was overcome by Titus
Quintus) had no great force in comparison of the Romans and the Grecians which invaded
him; yet, being a Martial Man, and one that understood how to insinuate with the Peo|ple,
and oblige the Nobility, he maintained War several years agaisnt both of them, and
though at last he lost some Towns, yet he kept his Kingdom in spight of them. Those
therefore of our Princes who for many years together were settled in their Principalities, if
they lost them afterwards, they cannot accuse fortune, but their own negligence and indis|cretion,
for not having in quiet times considered they might change (and it is the common
infirmity of Mankind in a calm to make no reckoning of a Tempest) when adversity ap|proached,
they thought more of making their escape than defence, resting their whole
hopes upon this, that when the people were weary of the insolence of the Conqueror, they
would recal them again. Which resolution is tolerable indeed, when others are wanting,
but to neglect all other remedies, and trust only to that, is much to be condemned, for a
man would never throw himself down, that another might take him up; besides, that may
not happen, or if it does, not with your security, because that kind of defence is poor, and
depends not on your self, and no defences are good, certain, and lasting, which proceed
not from the Princes own Courage and Virtue.



CHAP. XXV.
How far in human affairs Fortune may avail; and in
what manner she may be resisted.
I Am not ignorant that it is, and has been of old the opinion of many people, that the
affairs of the world are so govern'd by Fortune and Divine Providence, that Man can|not
by his Wisdom correct them, or apply any remedy at all; from whence they would
infer that we are not to labour and sweat, but to leave every thing to its own tendancy and
event. This opinion has obtained more in our days, by the many and frequent revolutions,
which have been, and are still seen beyond all humane conjecture. And when I think of
it seriously sometimes, I am in some measure inclined to it my self; nevertheless that our
own free will may not utterly be exploded, I conceive it may be true that fortune may
have the arbitrement of one half of our actions, but that she leaves the other half (or little
less) to be governed by our selves. Fortune, I do resemble to a rapid and impetuous River,
which when swelled, and enraged, overwhelms the Plains, subverts the Tees, and the
Houses, forces away the Earth from one place, and carries it to another, every body fears,
every body shuns, but no body knows how to resist it; Yet though it be thus furious some|times,
it does not follow but when it is quiet and calm, men may by banks, and fences,
and other provisions correct it in such manner, that when it swells again, it may be carried
off by some Canal, or the violence thereof rendered less licentious and destructive. So it
is with Fortune, which shows her power where there is no predisposed virtue to resist it,
and turns all her force and impetuosity, where she knows there are no banks, no fences to
restrain her: If you consider Italy (the seat of all these revolutions) and what it was that
caus'd them, you will find it an open field, without any bounds or Ramparts of secure it;
and that, had it been defended by the Courage of their Ancestors, as Germany, and Spain,
and France have been, those inundations had never hapned, or never made such devasta|tion
as they have done. And this I hold sufficient to have spoken in general against For|tune.
But restraining my self a little more to particulars, I say it is ordinary to see a Prince
happy one day, and ruined the next, without discerning any difference in his humor or
Government; and this I impute to the reasons of which I have discoursed largely before;
and one of them is, because that Prince which relies wholly upon Fortune, being subject
to her Variations, must of necessity be ruined. I believe, again that Prince may be happy,
whose manner of proceeding concerts with the times, and he unhappy who cannot accom|modate
to them: For in things leading to the end of their designs (which every man has
in his eye, and they are riches and honour) we see men have various methods of proceeding.
Some with circumspection, others with heat; some with violence, others with cunning;
some with patience, and others with fury, and every one (notwithstanding the diversity
of their ways) may possibly attain them. Again we see two persons equally cautious, one
of them prospers, and the other miscarris, and on the other side, two equally happy by
different measures, one being deliberate, and the other as hasty; and this proceeds from
nothing but the condition of the times which suits, or does not suit; with the manner of
their proceedings. From hence arises what I have said, That two persons by different
operations do attain the same end, whil'st two others steer the same Course, and one of
them succeeds, and the other is ruined. From hence likewise may be deduced the Vicissi|tudes
of good; for if to one who manages with deliberation and patience, the times and
conjuncture of affairs, come about so favourably that his Conduct be in fashion, he must
needs be happy; but if the face of affairs, and the times change, and he changes not with
them, he is certainly ruined. Nor is there any man to be found so wise, that knows how
to accommodate, or frame himself to all these varieties, both because he cannot deviate
from that to which Nature has inclined him; as likewise because if a man has constantly
prospered in one way, it is no easie matter to persuade him to another; and he that is so
cautious, being at a loss when time requires he should be vigorous, must of necessity be de|stroyed;
whereas if he could turn with the times, his fortune would never betray him.
Pope Iulius XI. in all his Enterprizes, acted with passion and vehemence, and the times
and accident of affairs were so sutable to his manner of proceeding, that he prospered in
whatever he undertook. Consider his Expedition of Bolonia in the days of Messer Giovanni
Benivogli, The Vnetians were against it, and the Kings of Spain and France were in treaty,
and had a mind to it themselves; yet he with his promptitude and fury, undertook it per|sonally
himself, and that activity of his, kept both Spaniard, and Venetian in suspence (the
Venetians for fear; the Spaniards, in hopes to recover the whole Kingdom of Naples, and

the King of France came over to his side; for seeing him in motion, and desirous to make
him his friend, and thereby to correct the insolence of the Venetian, he thought he could
not deny him his assistance, without manifest injustice; so that Iulius with his rashness
and huffing, did that which never any other Pope could have done with all his cunning and
insinuation: For had he deferred his departure from Rome, till all things had been put into
exact order, and his whole progress concluded (as any other Pope would have done) he
could never have succeeded; The King of France would have pretended a thousand ex|cuses,
and others, would have suggested twice as many fears; I will pass by the rest of his
Enterprizes, which were all alike, and prospered as well, and the shortness of his life secured
him against change: for had the times fallen out so, that he had been forced to proceed
with accurate circumspection, he would have certainly been ruined, for he could never
have left those ways to which his Nature inclined him. I conclude then, That whil'st the
obstinacy of Princes consists with the motion of fortune, 'tis possible they may be happy;
but when once they disagree, the poor Prince comes certainly to the ground. I am of
opinion likewise, that 'tis better to be hot and precipitate, then cautious and apprehensive,
for fortune is a Woman, and must be Hector'd, to keep her under; and 'tis visible every
day she suffers her self to be managed by those who are brisk and audacious, rather than by
those who are cold and phlegmatick in their Motions, and therefore (like a Woman) she is
always a friend to those who are young; because being less circumspect, they attack her with
more security and boldness.


CHAP. XXVI.
An Exhortation to deliver Italy from the Barbarians.
HAving weighed therefore all that is said before, and considered seriously with my self
whether in this juncture of affairs in Italy, the times were disposed for the advance|ment
of a new Prince, and whether there was competent matter that could give occasion to
a virtuous and wise person to introduce such a form as would bring reputation to him, and
benefit to all his Subjects; it seems to me that at this present so many things concur to the
exaltation of a new Prince, that I do not know any time that has been more proper than
this: and if (as I said before) for the Manifestation of the courage of Moses, it was neces|sary
that the Israelites should be Captives in Egypt; for discovery of the Magnanimity of
Cyrus, that the Persians should be oppressed by the Medes; and for the illustration of the
excellence of Theseus, that the Athenians should be banished and dispersed; so to evince
and demonstrate the courage of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy should be reduced
to its present condition; That it should be in greater bondage than the Iews; in greater
servitude than the Persians, and in greater dispersion than the Athenians, without Head,
without order, harras'd, spoyl'd, overcome, over-run, and over-flown with all kind of
Calamity: and though formerly some sparks of virtue have appeared in some persons, that
might give it hopes that God had ordained them for its redemption; yet it was found after|wards
that in the very height and career of their exploits, they were check'd, and forsaken
by Fortune, and poor Italy left half dead, expecting who would be her Samaritan to bind
up her wounds, put an end to the Sackings and devastations in Lombardy, the Taxes and
Expilations in the Kingdom of Naples, and Tuscany, and cure her sores, which length of
time had fester'd and imposthumated. 'Tis manifest how she prays to God daily to send some
person who may redeem her from the cruelty, and insolence of the Barbarians. 'Tis mani|fest
how prone and ready she is to follow the Banner that any man will take up; nor is it at
present to be discerned where she can repose her hopes with more probability, than in your
illustrious Family, which by its own courage and interest, and the favour of God and the
Church (of which it is now chief) may be induced to make it self Head in her redemption:
which will be no hard matter to be effected, if you lay before you the lives and actions of
the persons above named; who though they were rare, and wonderful, were yet but men,
and not accommodated with so fair circumstances as you. Their Enterprize was not more
just, nor easie, nor God Almighty more their friend than yours. You have Justice on your
side; for that War is just which is necessary, and 'tis piety to fight, were no hope is left in
any thing else. The people are universally disposed, and where the disposition is so great,
the opposition can be but small, especially you taking your rules from those persons which I
have proposed to you for a Model. Besides, many things that they did were super-natural,
and by Gods immediate Conduct, the Sea opened, a cloud directed, a rock afforded water,

it rained Manna, all these things are recompenced in your Grandeur, and the rest remains
to be executed by you: God will not do every thing immediately, because he will not de|prive
us of our free will, and the honour that devolves upon us. Nor is it any wonder if
none of the fore-named Italians have been able to do that which may be hoped for from
your illustrious Family: and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and so long continuation of
War, their Military Virtue seems spent and extinguished; the reason is, their old Disci|pline
was not good, and no body was able to direct to a better. Nothing makes so much to
the honour of a new Prince, as new Laws, and new Orders invented by him, which if they
be well founded, and carry any thing of Grandeur along with them, do render him vene|rable,
and wonderful; and Italy is susceptible enough of any new form. Their courage is
great enough in the Soldier, if it be not wanting in the Officer, witness the Duels, and
Combats, in which the Italians have generally the better by their force, and dexterity, and
stratagem; but come to their Battels, and they have oftner the worst, and all from the in|experience
of their Commanders; for those who pretend to have Skill, will never obey,
and every one thinks he has Skill, there having been no body to this very day, raised by his
virtue and fortune to that height of reputation, as to prevail with others to obey him. Hence
it came, that in so long time, in the many Wars during the last twenty years, when ever
an Army consisted wholly of Italians, it was certainly beaten; and this may be testified by
Tarus, Alexandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, and Mestri. If therefore your illustri|ous
Family be inclined to follow the examples of those excellent persons who redeemed
their Countries, it is necessary as a true fundamental of all great Enterprizes, to provide your
selves with Forces of your own Subjects, for you cannot have more faithful, nor better
Soldiers than they. And though all of them be good, yet altogether they will be much
better, when they find themselves not only commanded, but preferred, and caressed by a
Prince of their own. It is necessary therefore to be furnished with these Forces, before you
can be able with Italian virtue to vindicate your Country from the oppression of Strangers:
And though the Swiss, and Spanish Infantry be counted terrible, they have both of them
their defects: and a third sort may be composed that may not only encounter, but be con|fident
to beat them; for the Spanish Foot cannot deal with Horse, and the Swiss are not
invincible when they meet with Foot as obstinate as themselves. It has been seen by expe|rience,
and would be so again, the Spaniards cannot sustain the fury of the French Cavalry,
and the Swisses have been overthrown by the Infantry of Spain. And though of this last
we have seen no perfect Experiment; yet we had a competent Essay at the Battel of Ra|venna,
where the Spanish Foot being engaged with the German Battalions (which observe
the same Order and Discipline with the Swisses) the Spaniards by the agility of their Bodies,
and the protection of their Bucklers, broke in under their Pikes, and killed them securely,
while the poor Germans were uncapable to defend themselves; and had not the Spaniards
been charged by the Horse, the German Foot had been certainly cut off. 'Tis possible
therefore (the defect of both those Foot being known) to institute a third, which may
buckle with the Horse, and be in no fear of their foot; which will be effected, not by the
variation of their Arms, but by changing their Discipline. And these are some of those
things which being newly reformed, give great grandeur and reputation to any new Prince.
This opportunity therefore is by no means to be slip'd, that Italy, after so long expectation,
may see some hopes of deliverance: Nor can it be expressed with what joy, with what
impatience of revenge, with what fidelity, with what compassion, with what Tears, such
a Champion would be received into all the Provinces that have suffered by those barbarous
inundations. What Gates would be shut against him? What people would deny him obe|dience?
what malice would oppose him? what true Italian would refuse to follow him?
There is not, there is not any body but abhors, and nauseates this barbarous domination.
Let your illustrious Family, then address it self to the work, with as much Courage and
Confidence as just Enterprizes are undertaken; That under their Ensigns our Country may
be recovered, and under their Conduct, Petrarch's Prophesie may be fulfilled, who has
promised that,
Virtu contr' al furore
Prendera l' arme, and fia il combatter Corto.
Che l' antico valore
Ne' gl' Italici curr' non e ancor morto.
Virtue shall arm 'gainst rage, and in short sight
Prove th' Roman Valour's not extinguish'd quite.


The Original of the words Guelf and Ghibilin, so
much mentioned in History.
THese two Factions so famous in History, were eminent in Italy two ages before Ca|struccio
was born. Machiavel in his Treatise of the Wars of that Country, affirms
that Pistoia was the first place where those names of distinction were used, but the account
wherewith the publick Libraries supply me, runs thus. These two words, Guelf and Ghi|bilin,
deduce their original from a schism which molested the Church in the year 1130. by
the competition of two Popes, Innocent 11. and Anaclet: the greatest part of Christendom
acknowledged Innocent, who was particularly supported by the Emperors of the West. Ana|clet
the anti-Pope had persuaded into his interests, Roger Comte de Naples and Sicily, a mar|tial
Prince, and descended from the Normans, who had conquered that Country. The
pretence of this double Election having kept a War on foot eight years together, which
was still favourable to Roger, the Emperor Conrad the third march'd himself at the head of
an Army of Germans, into Italy, leaving his Grand-son Prince Henry to come after. Roger,
to oppose him with men of his own Nation, allured to the defence of his Countries Guelf
Duke of Bavaria. During the course of this War which began in the year 1139. it hapned
sometimes that the Emperors Army was commanded by the said Prince Herny, who was
brought up in a Village in Germany called Ghibilin, whose situation being very pleasant,
made the very name of it ear to him. One day the Armies being drawn up, and ready to
engage, the Bavarians to encourage their Comrades, cryed out in their language, a Guelf, a
Guelf; and the Emperors Troops (being at the same time as well disposed to their General)
to comply with the kindness he had for that place, cryed out on the other side, a Ghibilin, a
Ghibilin. These words seemed barbarous to the Italians that were with Roger, who came to
Guelf to know what they meant: He told them the Pope's Party were intended by the word
Guelf, and the Emperors by the word Ghibilin: from that time those names grew so com|mon
in both Armies, that by them they answered their Who goes there? and they were given
to the Italians according to their several sides. 'Tis true, at first they were used to discri|minate
only Anaclet's Party from the Emperors, but afterwards Roger having vanquished
and taken prisoner Pope Innocent; as the price of his liberty he oblig'd him to erect the
Countries of Naples and Sicily into Kingdoms, by which treaty Roger being taken off from
the interest of the anti-Pope, and engaging entirely with the Church, he affix'd the name
of Guelf to the Pope's Party, and confirm'd the name Ghibilin to the Faction of the Em|peror.
The Italians would fain have the credit of the Etymology themselves, and by a certain
gingling of words, (and that mightily strain'd) would have Guelf deriv'd from Guardatori
di fe, because (forsooth) 'tis they who defend the Faith of the Church: and that by cor|ruption
the word Ghibilin was form'd from Guida belli, that is Guidatori di Bataglia, a great
Title, and sutable to the Majesty of the Empire.
Be it which way it will, these two Factions were in the height of their emulation two
hundred years after, that is to say, about the year 1320. which was very near the time that
Castruccio was in his prosperity. And in Europe the face of affairs stood thus.
The Popes (driven from Rome by the violence of the Emperors of the West) had trans|ferred
the Holy Chair to Avignon in France. In the year 1320. it was possessed by Iohn
XXII. a Prince of himself firm and entire, but one who by the precipitate counsels of other
people had excommunicated the Emperor Lewis of the house of Bavaria, and been too
busie with his fulminations against five more Princes of Italy, who (being treated by him
like Tyrants) confederated against him; their names were Castruccio Sovereign of Lucca,
Scaliger, Lord of Verona, the Marquess d' Esti Lord of Ferrara, and Visconti, and Gonzague
the first Sovereign of Milan, and the other of Mantoua: which created troubles to
Italy.
The Empire of the East was at that time torn, and distracted by the ambition of the Pali|ologi
and others, whilst in the mean time the Sultan Orchan son of Ottoman, swept away
Lycaonia, Phrygia, and all the Coast of the Hellespont from the Greeks.

The Empire of the West was then in dispute betwixt Frederick of Austria, and Lewis
of Bavaria, (whom Machiavel, by mistake or inadvertency, has called Frederick, Lewis af|ter
long and bloody Wars overcome his Competitor, and made several Voyages into Italy
to invigorate and reinforce Castruccio and the Ghibilins.
France was governed by Philip le Long, who at the solicitation of Pope Iohn passed an
Army into Italy to the relief of the Guelfs, which Army was commanded by Philip de Va|lois
afterwards King, but his Expedition did not answer expectation; for either the cun|ning
or bribes of the Ghibilins had dispelled the storm which our preparations threatned
upon Lombardy; or our Forces were recalled upon some secret apprehension of a fourth
War with the English, or by the vast projects of a fifth Expedition to the Holy Land.
Spain was divided into five Kingdoms, each of which had its peculiar King; four of
them were Christians, and one a Mahumetan.
Navar had the same King with France. Philip the Long found a way to extend the Sa|lick
Law into that Country, and defeat his Niece Iane of France, Daughter of Lewis Hutin,
of both Kingdoms at once.
Alphonso XI. as Mariana calls him, (the XII. as Garibay) had at that time the Scepter
of Castile, but his minority transferr'd the Conduct of Affairs into the hands of the two
Infanti, Don Pedro, and Don Iohn, insomuch as by the jealousie and division betwixt the
two Regents, that Kingdom was exposed to such disorders as are inseparable from the mi|nority
of a Prince. At length the two Infanti were slain in the year 1320. in a Fight
which their rashness caused them to lose to the Mores under the walls of Granada.
Arragon was in obedience to Don Iacques the second of that name; He was Brother to
Fredrick, who reigned in Sicily to the prejudice of Robert, a Prince of the House of
Anjou. This Robert was King of Naples, sided with the Guelfs, and leagued himself sun|dry
times with the Florentines against Castruccio. Iames, King of Aragon, designing to
establish himself in Italy, and judging that the Conquests which he mediated upon the
Isles of Corsica and Sardinia, depended much upon the Concord of his Subjects at home;
He caused a General Assembly of his Estates to be held in the year 1320. in which was
concluded the Union of the Kingdoms of Aragon and Valentia, with the Principality of
Catolonia.
Don Denis reigned in Portugal, a person eminent among his Subjects for magnificent
Building, and in great veneration for his Piety and Justice. But the felicity of his Reign
was disturbed by domestick broils which he had with his Son, the Infant Don Alphonso,
who succeeded him in the Crown. Don Denis instituted the Order of Christ in the
year 1320.
The More, Ismael, first of that name, had the Monarchy of Granada; the Battel which
he gained 1320. against the two Infanti of Castile, reviv'd the affairs of that Nation, which
were in their declension before, and gave new alarms to all Spain.
The King and Kingdom of England were both governed by favourites at that time.
Edward 2. gave his authority and confidence, one while to Gaveston, and then to the two
Spencers; and this weakness and imprudence of his created so many discontents, and ren|dred
him so odious to the people, that after much trouble to quit himself of an Impostor
who pretended to the Crown, he was forced to go thorow a cruel War against the Nobi|lity,
and another no less dangerous against Robert Bruce King of Scotland. These great
stirs and commotions could not but give some jealousies to France, which seeing the Provin|ces
that the English had on that side the Sea perpetually in Arms, was obliged to keep upon
so strong a Guard, as was little different from an open War.
It is not then to be admired, the affairs of Europe being in this confusion, if Italy was
left in prey to the Guelfs and the Ghibilins, and gave opportunity to the laying the founda|tion
of so many Principalities, that the most part of them are still in existence. But it is
certain, that neither Paulus Iovius, Girolamo Briani, il Biondo, nor the rest of the Historians,
who have written of the Wars and Concussions of these two Factions, have left any thing
comparable to the adventures of Castruccio, they have lent me indeed some circumstances
for the illustration and ornament of this History, and I have been forced to paraphrase upon
five or six of the sayings of Castruccio to give them their true Grace, and make them in|telligible,
I know not whether I have followed the just temperament that is to be observed
in a translation. 'Tis vitious to assume such liberty as the History will not bear, but on the
other, to tye ones self up to the same, and same quantity of words, is as disingenuous and
servile. 'Tis true, the same comma's and stops were by no means to be neglected, were all
treatises that are translated, like the fallacious answer of a Divine to Braccio Montone So|vereign
of Perusia, which Braccio being a Ghibilin as well as Castruccio, departed for the
Siege of Aquila a Town in the Kingdom of Naples, and being impatient to know his suc|cess,

upon application to an Astrologer, he received this answer, Ibis redibis non morieris
in bello: which if punctuated thus, Ibis, redibis non, morieris in bello, threatned the said
Braccio with the unfortunateness of his Expedition; whereas altering it thus, Ibis, redibis,
non morieris in bello, portended quite contrary. An ambiguity like this was sent also to
Manfred King of Sicily, not long before he was defeated by Charles of Anjou. NO
CARLO SARA VITORIOSO DEL RE MANFREDO, and
ought to be interpreted with great exactness and acuracy, the mistake of a comma being as
much as a mans life is worth. There is another kind of Tyranny likewise, and that is
when the Text of the Author is to regulate in a point of Religion: but here we are not
under any such necessities, and he who in a quarrelsom capriccio, to defame my translati|on,
would compare every line, and put the English words all along under the Italian, would
make a new and pleasant kind of Dictionary, and the beauties which are peculiar to each
language, would be excellently presented.





THE
LIFE
OF
CASTRVCCIO CASTRACANI
OF
LVCCA,
Written by Nicolo Machiavelli and Dedicated to
Zanobi Buonbelmonti and Luigi Alamani
his particular Friends.
IT seems (most Excellent Friends) to those who consider it, very strange, that all, or the
greatest part of them, who in this world have perform'd any thing extraordinary, and
raised themselves above the pitch of their Contemporaries, have had their births and
beginnings mean and obscure, or else infested and perplexed with all the difficulties
that fortune could present. For all of them having been exposed to wild beasts when they
were young, or being descended from base Parentage, and ashamed of their Extraction,
they have declared themselves Sons of Iupiter, or some other Deity, of which sort the
number being so great, and their story so well known, to repeat them would be both super|fluous
and troublesome. The reason I suppose to be, that fortune willing to demonstrate
to the world, that 'tis not any ones prudence, but she that raises men to be great, begins to
shew and exercise her power at a time in which prudence can pretend to no share in us;
that all our successes may be acknowledged to her. Castruccio Castracani of Lucca was one
of this sort, who in respect of the times in which he lived, and the place in which he was
born, performed great things; for in his beginning he was neither more happy not more
eminent than the rest, as you shall understand in my description of his life, which I have
thought good to transmit to Posterity, having observed many things in it (both for virtue
and event) of extraordinary example; and to you it seemed most proper to direct it, as
persons more delighted with honourable and heroick actions, than any I know be|sides.
I say then, the Family of the Castracani is reckoned among the most Illustrious Families
in the City of Lucca, though at present (according to the fatality of all worldly things)
it seems to be extinct. Out of this house there was born in former times one Antonio,
who entring himself into Orders, was made a Canon of Saint Mitchel in Lucca, and in to|ken
of Honour called Messer Antoin: He had no kindred but one Sister, who was married
long before to one Buonaccorso Cinami: Buonaccorso being dead, and she being a Widow,
she lived with her Brother, with resolution to marry no more. Behind the house in which
he dwelt, Master Anthony had a Vineyard, which bordering upon several Gardens, was ac|cessible
from several parts, and without much difficulty. It hapned that one morning about
Sun-rise, Madam Dianora (for that was the Sisters name) walking out into the Vineyard to
gather herbs for a Salad (as women frequently do), she heard a rusling under the leaves,
and turning towards it, she fancyed it cryed; advancing up towards it, she saw the hands
and face of a child, which tumbling up and down in the leaves, seemed to call for relief:

Madam Dianora, partly astonished, and partly afraid, took it up very tenderly, carried it
home, wash'd it and having put it in clean clouts, she presented it to Master Antony, who
understanding the case and seeing the Infant, was no less affected with wonder and com|passion
than his Sister before him. Debating with themselves what course was to be taken,
it was concluded to bring it up, Anthony being a Priest, and she having no children. They
christened it Castruccio, by the name of their Father, and look'd to it as carefully as it had
been their own. Castruccio's graces encreased with his years, and his wit was so pregnant,
they put him to nothing but he took it very well. Anthony designed him for a Priest, and
to resign his Canonship and other Benefices one day, and according to that design he gave
him education; but he could not find that Castruccio had inclination to that kind of life;
on the contrary, he perceived his natural disposition tending quite another way.
In short, Castruccio was scarce 14 years old, but abating by little and little of his awe and
respects to Antonio and Dianora, he began to neglect his Studies, to devote himself to Arms,
and taking great delight in wrestling, and running, and such violent exercises, his mettle
was so well suted with the strength of his body, that none of his companions were able
to cope with him. He troubled himself very little with reading, unless it were such things
as might instruct him for War, or acquaint him with the great actions of some eminent
Commander, which did not only disquiet Antonio, but afflicted him.
There was at that time in Lucca a Gentleman called Francisco, of the House of the
Guinigi a handsom man, very rich, and remarkable for many good qualities, which re|commended
him to one of the first ranks in the Town. He had born Arms all his life long,
and for the most part under the Viscontis, Dukes of Milan. He had with them engaged
for the Ghibilins, and the City of Lucca look'd upon him as the very life of their party.
It was at the time when these two great Factions (the Guelfs and the Ghibilins) shared all
Italy betwixt them, divided the Popes and the Emperors, engaged in their different interests
the Inhabitants of the same Town, and the members of the same Family. Francisco ac|companied
usually by persons of Quality of his Cabal, walk'd often before the place of
St. Michael, not far from the Palace of the Podestat or Governor. In that Market-place he
tooke notice of Castruccio, who was often times playing there amongst his School-fellows and
Comrades. He observed the youth always prescribed such sports to the rest, as he had cho|sen
on purpose to prepare him for the War. Francisco could easily perceived how much the
agility of Castruccio advanced him above his Companions, and he as easily perceived that he
assumed an authority over them, and that they on their part paid him a reverence, and such
a one as was accompanied with kindness and zeal. Francisco took a great fancy to the boy, in|quited
what he was, and being informed by some who were by, he had a months mind to
have him himself: calling him to him one day, he ask'd him if he did not prefer a Gentle|mans
Family, where he might learn to ride the great Horse, and exercise his Arms before
the Cloister of a Church-man where he must spin out his days in idleness and melancholy.
He no sooner mentioned Horses and Arms, but Castruccio was ready to have leap'd out of
his skin; but recollecting himself, a sentiment of modesty kept him from answering, till the
fine words of Francisco having given him more confidence, he told him, that if he had the
liberty of choosing he had rather a thousand times be employed as a Gentleman, than in
the way for which he was design'd. His resolution was so pleasing to Francisco, that not
long after he made a visit to Antonio, and begg'd Castruccio of him, in so pressing, and yet so
civil a manner, that Antonio finding it impossible to master the natural inclinations of the
youth, delivered him to Francisco.
By this means Castruccio changed his Education, and 'tis not to be beleived with what
easiness he improved in those exercises which are fit for a Gentleman to learn. It was to
be admired with what address and vigor he mounted his horse, with what grace he ma|naged
his launce, and with what comeliness his sword; and this his dexterity distinguished
him so highly from the croud of his companions, that it would have been imprudence in
any one of them to have contended with him, either at the Barrieri or Iusts. To all these
advantages he had an engaging way with him, that obliged where-ever he came; his actions
and his words seemed premedtiate and studied, so careful, and so regular he was lest he
should say or do any thing that might any ways offends. He carried himself always with
respect to his superiors, with modesty to his equals, and with civility and complaisance to
those who were beneath him; so that these good qualities did not only gain him the affe|ction
of Francisco's whole Family, but the love and esteem of the whole City of Lucca.
he was eighteen years old when the Faction of the Guelfs drove the Ghibilins out of
Pania. Visconti Prince of Milan, a zealous Partizan of the Ghibilins, solicited Succours
from Francisco Guinigi, who casting his eyes upon Castruccio, as the first mark of his affe|ction,
made him Lieutenant of a Company of Foot, and marched with him to Visconti.

The first Campania this new Lieutenant made, put him into such reputation, that he
eclipsed the glory of all the rest who served in that War: He gave so great and so many
testimonies both of his courage and conduct, that his fame was spread all over Lombardy.
When also he came back to Lucca, and observed the Town had doubled the respect which
they had for him before, he applyed himself to make new friendships, and to that purpose
made use of all the courtesie and insinuation that is necessary in that case.
Not long after Francesco Guinigi fell sick, and finding himself near his end, having but
one Son of about 13 years of age, called Pagolo, he sent for Castruccio, and committed the
tuition of his Son, and the management of his Estate into his hands, and having gently
remembred Castruccio that he was the Person who raised him, he begg'd that he would
shew the same generosity towards Pagolo as he had done towards him; and if any thing was
due to the bounty of the Father, to return it upon his Son. He fancied he discerned in the
countenance of Castruccio all the marks and indications of a generous mind, and died with|out
being disturbed with the least suspicion of his ingratitude.
The trust, and his administration of so great an Estate made Castruccio more considera|ble
than before, but they created him likewise some enemies, and lessened the affection
which some had had for him: for knowing him to be of an enterprizing spirit, many
began to fancy his designs were tyrannical, and to oppress the liberty of his Country. The
Signeur Giorgio Opizi (chief of the Guelfs Faction in Lucca) was the most to be appre|hended
of all those that accused Castruccio with that abominable ambition. Opizi was of
opinion that the death of Francesco Guinigi, head of the adverse party, would leave him
Master of the Town, but he quickly found that the single reputation o Castruccio would
be a new impediment to his usurpation; so that thinking to rob him of the affections of
the people, he spread false reports, and aspersed him where-ever he came. At first these
calumniations troubled Castruccio but little, but at length they alarm'd him to the purpose;
for he suspected that Opizi would not fail to set him at odds with the Lieutenant which
Robert King of Naples had settled in Lucca and that if that Governor was his enemy, he
should in a short time be turned out of the Town. And against so great danger, his pro|vision
was this.
The Town of Pisa was then under the Government of Huguccione de Fagivola, original|ly
of the Town of Arrezzo; being chosen Captain by the Pisans, he had made himself
their Soveraign, and having given protection to certain Ghibilins who were banished from
Lucca, Castruccio entred into secret intelligence by the privity of Huguccione, and being as|sured
of his assistance he resolved the poor Exiles should be restored. To this effect he
agreed with his friends in Lucca, who were of his Counsel, and jealous as himself of the
power of the Opizi. All necessary measures were taken by the Conspirators. Castruccio
had the care of fortifying privately a Tower in the City, called the Tower of Honour. He
furnished it with ammunition, in case he should be forced to defend it; and having ap|pointed
the night for the execution of their design, Huguccione failed not at the precise
hour to be at the Rendezvous betwixt Lucca and the neighbouring Mountains. Upon a
signal given to Castruccio he advanced towards the Gate of St. Peter, and set fire to the Anti|port
next the ields, whilst Castruccio broke down another on the other side of the Town.
In the mean time his associates cryed out To your Arms, to excite the people to rise, and
thereby put all things into confusion. Huguccione entred with his Troops, and having
seized upon the Town, he caused all the Opizi to be murdered, and all the rest of their par|ty
which fell into their hands. The Governor, for the King of Naples was turned out,
and the Government of the Town altered, as Huguccione directed, who, to compleat the de|solations
of Lucca, banished no less than a hundred of the best Families that belonged to it
The miserable Exiles fled part to Florence and part to Pistoia, two Towns of the Faction of
the Guelfs, and for that reason enemies to Huguccione, and the prevailing party in
Lucca.
The Florentines and whole Faction of the Guelfs, apprehending this great success would
hazard to re-establish the power of the Ghibilins in Tuscany, they entred into consultation
which way those Exiles might be restored. They set out a considerable Army, and encam|ped
at Monte Carlo to open themselves a passage to Lucca. Huguccione on his side drew the
Lucca Troops together, and put them under the Command of Castruccio, and then joyning
them with his own from Pisa, and reinforcing them with a Squadron of German Horse
which he got out of Lombardy, he marched out to encounter the Florentines. Whereupon
the Florentines quitted their Post at Monte Carlo and entrenching betwixt Monte-Catino and
Pescia, Huguccione possessed himself of the quarter which they had left. Their Armies be|ing
within two miles distance one from the other, their Horse met daily and skirmished, and
they had come certainly to a peremptory Battel, had not Huguccione fallen ill just in the

nick. His disposition forcing him from the Camp to look out for better accommodation
in Monte-carlo, he left the Command of the Army to Castruccio, his retirement, which
discouraged his own men, and made them think of protracting the Battel, animated the
Florentines, but brought no great advantage to their affairs, In short, the Florentines
perceiving their Enemies without a General, began to despise them, and Castruccio ob|serving
how much they were elated, endeavoured to augment it. He pretended great Con|sternation,
and to make his fear the more credible, he gave Orders that his Troops should
be drawn up within the Lines, but with positive inhibition for any of them to go forth,
though not a moment passed but the Florentines provoked them; but all to no purpose.
Besides that, this pretended terror in Castruccio redoubled the rashness of the Enemy, and
perfectly blinded them, he drew another advantage from it, which was to discover exactly
the disposition of their Army and the Order of their March. When he had well observed
them, and tempted their temerity as much as he thought fit, he resolved to fight them the
next Bravado they made, and omitting nothing that might encourage his Soldiers, he assu|red
them of Victory if they followed his Commands. He had observed that the weakest
and worst arm'd of their Soldiers were disposed still in their wings, and their best placed in
the Body. Castruccio drew up in the same Order, but distributed his Soldiers quite contrary,
for the worst and most unserviceable he placed in the Body and his best men in the wings,
In this posture he drew out of the Trenches, and had scarce form'd his Battalia, before the
Enemy appeared, and with his usual insolence. Castruccio Commanded that the Body
should march slowly, but the two wings were to advance as fast as they could; so that when
they came to engage, there was only the wings that could fight; for Castruccio's Body
having lagged by Command, the Florentine Body had too far to march before they could
charge them, so as they remained idle, being neither able to do any thing against the Main
Body that was design'd to oppose them, nor sustain those who were engaged in the wings;
so it hapned that the Florentine wings (composed of the refuse of their Soldiers) were easily
broken by Castruccio's, which consisted of his best, and when the wings of the Enemy
(which were drawn up before their Body; so as the whole Army was ranged in the figure
of a half Moon) were routed, they turn'd tail, ran among their own Body which was
marching behind them, and put all into Confusion.
The loss was very great to the Florentines, they left above 10000 men dead upon the place
Their best Officers, and the bravest of the Guelfs perished there unfortunately, and to
make the defeat the more lamentable, there were several Reformades which died there, of
extraodinary quality. Among the rest, Piero Brother to Robert King of Naples; Carlo
Nephew to the said King; Philip Lord of Tarentum, who were all come, in Gallantry,
to make that Compania with the Florentines. But that which made all the more wonder|ful
was that Castruccio lost not above 300 men, though unhappily one of Hugucciones
Sons were of that Number, his Name was Francesco, who sighting briskly at the head of
the Voluntiers, for want of good Conduct, was slain at the very first charge. So eminent
a Victory as this, must needs put Castruccio into a reputation beyond expression; but Hu|guccione
had like to have died, with meer jealousie, he foresaw that nothing of all this would
redound to him, but the vain honour of commanding in chief, and that the real advan|tage
would all fall to his Lieutenant, so that to use him at that rate, was to rob him of his
Soveraignty: whereupon, nettled exceedingly, in great envy of his Fortune, he resolved
he should die. Whil'st he was in this black resolution, and attended nothing but some
specious pretence to get Castruccio to him, and so draw him into his Net, it hapned that
Agnolo Micheli (a Person of great alliance as any in Lucca, was murther'd by one who took
Sanctuary in Castruccio's House, and was protected: Huguccione's Officers pursued, and
demanded the Criminal; but Castruccio denyed them, and suffered him to escape. Hu|guccione
(who was then at Pisa) unwilling to lose so fair an opportunity to revenge him|self,
sent for one of his Sons called Nerli (whom he put before into possession of the Sove|raignty
of Lucca) commands him to repair thither with all speed, and get Castruccio to his
house under pretence of supping with some of the most eminent in the Town; and private
Orders were given for the making him away, Nerli lay'd his ambush for Castruccio very
handsomly, for suspecting nothing, he came to the Feast, and was arrested before he went
out of the Palace. But Nerli (being over circumspect, and imagining it might work
some alteration in the Spirits of the People, if he killed him bluntly without any formality)
writ to his Father to know how he should dispose of him. Huguccione, mad at his unsea|sonable
prudence, departed from Pisa at the head of 400 Horse, to go himself in person to
dispatch Castruccio; but, Huguccione was scarce got to Bagni, before the Pisans revolted;
cut his Deputies throat; and slew all his Family that were left behind; and that he might
be sure they were in earnest, they chose the Conte de Guerardesc, and made him their

Governor. Though he had news of this Rebellion before his arrival at Lucca, yet he
thought it inconvenient to return; on the contrary, he made all the hast thither that he
could, to be there (if possible) before the report, lest if the news got before him, it might
have ill effect upon the Luccheses, and prevail with them to exclude him their City. But
the Luccheses had heard it before, had such designs of their own, and the liberty of Ca|struccio
was the thing they were to pretend. Huguccione was admitted, but his presence
was not sufficient to keep them in their duties: They began to assemble in parties, to
whisper and speak slightly of him in private, then to murmur, then to tumultuate, and
taking Arms by degrees, they came boldly, and demanded Castruccio should be enlarged,
and this they did in so positive and audacious a manner, that Huguccione apprehending, the
consequences, delivered him to them. Castruccio not contented with that, conceiving vaster
designs than formerly, and egg'd on by an equal impulse of honour and revenge, he assem|bled
his friends, and taking the benefit of the favourable disposition of the People, he re|solved
to oppose himself against Huguccione, and forcing of him out of Lucca with all his
party, Huguccione retired into Lombardy to the Lords of Scala where not long after he
died very poor.
This was a happy turn for Castruccio, from the incommodities of a Prison, to the Supre|macy
of a Prince; and yet this was not enough. Finding himself accompanied by a great
number of his Friends which encouraged him, and by the whole body of the people, which
flattered his ambition, he caused himself to be chosen Captain General of all their Forces
for a Twelve-month; and resolving to perform some Eminent action that might justifie
their choice, he undertook the reduction of several places which had revolted from that
City in favour of Huguccione. Having to this purpose entered into strict alliance with the
City of Pisa, they sent him supplies, and he marched with them to besiege Serezane, But
the place being very strong; before he could carry it, he was obliged to build a Fortress
as near it as he could. This new Post in two months time, render'd him Master of the
whole Country, and is the same Fort that at this day is called Serezanello, repaired since,
and much enlarged by the Florentines. Supported by the credit of so glorious an exploit,
he reduced Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza very easily: he seized likewise upon the whole
Country of Lunigiana, and to secure his Communication with Lombardy, he took Pont
Remoli by force, and drove out Anastasio Palavicini the Sovereign: So that full of glory
he returned to Lucca, where the People thronged to meet him, and received him with all
possible demonstrations of joy.
This was the happiest conjuncture for Castruccio in the world, for having been so discreet
before to make his interest with the most considerable of the Luccheses, and among the rest
with Poggio, Portico, Baccansachi, and Cecco Guinigi, the favour of these great men, con|curring
with the inclination of the people, and every thing else contributing to his happi|ness,
he was solemnly chosen their Soveraign Prince.
About this time Frederick de Baviere, King of the Romans passed out of Germany into
Italy, to be crown'd Emperor there. Castruccio who had already wrought himself in some
measure into his favour, put himself at the head of 500 Horse, and went to wait upon him,
having left as his Deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi, his Pupil, whom he had treated all
along, as he had been his own Son, in consideration of the benefits he had received from
his Father. Frederick received Castruccio with much kindness, and having done him seve|ral
honours, and granted him many signal perogatives, he made him his Lieutenant in the
whole province of Tuscany; besides all this, the Inhabitants of Pisa (at the same time
mutining against their Governor Gerardesca, and driving him out of the Town) to defend
themselves against his resentment, addressed to Frederick for protection, and he gave the
Soveraignty of that Town to Castruccio. His choice was not unpleasing to the Inhabitants
who knew not where to find a better support against the Faction of the Guelfs, and parti|cularly
against the attempts of the Florentine.
After this, Frederick return'd into Germany, having made a Lieutenant General of all
Italy, and left him in Rome. There was not at that time either in Lombardy or Tuscany,
any of the Ghibilins of the Emperor's party, but looked upon Castruccio as the true head of
their Faction. Those who were banished their Country upon that score, fled to him for
protection, and promised unanimously that if he could restore them to their Estates, they
would serve him so effectually, that the Soveraignty of their Country should be the recom|pence
of his kindness. The chief of them were the Guidi, Scolari, Uberti, Gerozzi, Nar|di,
and Buomoccorsi, all Exiles of Florence: So that, flattered by their promises, and
encouraged by the strength of his own force, he entertained a design of making himself
Master of Tuscany, and to give more reputation to his affairs, he entred into a League
with Matteo Visconti Prince of Milan. He put out a Proclamation afterwards, that all his

Subjects which were capable to bear Arms, should be ready at a certain warning to put
themselves into Service; and for the better order of the Muster Rolls, by which his Militia
was to be regulated, the City of Lucca having five Gates, he divided the whole Country
into five parts, and disposed every Soldier under his officer with so much, exactness, that
in a short time he could march with 20000 Men, besides what he could draw out of Pisa.
Whil'st he was fortifying himself with Soldiers and Friends; it fell out, that the Guelfs
in Plaisansa having driven out the Ghibilins, and received considerable succours from Flo|rence,
and the King of Naples came thundering down upon the Territories of the Prince
of Milan. The Prince desired Castruccio to give the Florentines diversion; to carry the
War into their Country, to withdraw them from Lombardy, and thereby to put them upon
the defensive, Castruccio desired no more, and fell with a flying Army into the Valley of
Arno, took Fucechio and San-Miniato, and ravaged the Country so effectually, that the
Florentines were constrained to call back their Troops out of Lombardy; but the necessity
of another diversion called back Castruccio to the recovery of Lucca. In his absence, the
Family of the Poggi, which had been always his friends, and contributed more to his Ele|vation,
than any of the rest; regreting that they had not been rewarded, according to the
merits of their Services, conspired with several others of the Inhabitants to bring the City
to revolt. They began the tumult one morning, and having put themselves in Arms, they
killed the Chief Officer which Castruccio had established for the administration of justice.
But whil'st they were disposing themselves to push on their Sedition, Stephano Poggio, an
old Man, of a peaceable temper, and one who had not medled at all in the Conspiracy of his
Relations, made use of the authority he had with them, caused them to lay down their Arms,
and offered his intercession to Castruccio that they might obtain their demands. Upon the
first notice of this Commotion, Castruccio drew a party out of his Army, and leaving the
rest under the Command of Pagolo Guinigi, he marched with all diligence back to Lucca,
where finding things quieter than he expected, he knew very well how to make his advan|tage
of so temperate a submission, and disposed his Troops and his Friends in all the Posts
that might make him Master of the Town. Stephano Poggio, who thought in this juncture
he had highly obliged Castruccio, came to make him a visit, and judged it unnecessary to
beg any thing of him; all that he requested was, that he would pardon his Family, allow
something to their ancient Services, and give some little Indulgence to the transports of
their youth. Castruccio received him with much affection, and told him that he was more
pleased to find those troubles appeased, than he had been offended at the news of their
Commotion; and having pressed him to bring the Male-contents to him, he added, that
he thank'd his stars for giving him such an opportunity of signalizing his Clemency.
Upon Stephano's importunity, and Castruccio's promise, they came all to attend him; but
Castruccio apprehending that this new Service of Stephano might some time or other be
reproached to him again, he resolved to make a signal Example; and accordingly regula|ting
himself by the severe politicks of Usurpers who upon such nice and critical occasions
make no bones to sacrifice the innocence of particular man, to the conservation of the
multitude, he commanded that the Mutineers and Stephano with them should be conducted
to Prison, and from thence to Execution.
Whil'st he was thus employed, the Florentines recovered San Miniato, and Castruccio
holding it imprudence to keep in the Field, whil'st he was insecure in the Town, resolved
to give some relaxation to his Arms: He endeavour'd privately to feel how the Florentines
stood disposed to a Truce, and (the War having exhausted their Coffers) he found them
so coming, that it was concluded for two years, upon condition that either party should
retain what was then in their possession.
Castruccio being disintangled from his foreign Embarrasments, applyed himself wholly
to his security at home, and under several pretences, to quit himself of all those who were
likely to dispute his Soveraignty of Lucca, not sparing his Confiscations, and Proscriptions
against the Exiles, nor the Executions of any who were under his hands. To excuse him|self
he gave out that he had had too much Experience already of the infidelity of those
people, to trust them again; But a strong Citadel which erected in the City, was the
true way to continue his Authority; and to give the more terror to the Citizens, he caused
the houses of his adversaries to be demolished, and the Citadel to be built of their Materials.
His peace with the Florentines, and his Fortifications at Lucca, employ'd him not so much,
as to lessen his thoughts how he might make himself greater; being unwilling again to
come to an open War, he entertained private correspondencies, both on one side and
the other. He had an ardent desire to make himself Master of the Town of Pistoia, per|suading
himself it would give him footing in Florence; and in this prospect he held a secret
Commerce of amity with the different parties, which were predominant in Pistoia. This

double intelligence was managed with that slyness and delicacy, that each of them believed
they were particularly in his Confidence. It was a long time that these two opposite Cabals
had divided, or rather distracted that City. The one called the Faction of the Bianchi,
had Bastiano da Possente for its head; and the other called the Neri, was commanded by
Iacopo de Gia. Each of them boyling with desire to supplant its competitor, repos'd
much upon the promises of Castruccio: and these two Heads of the Factions who had long
been suspected to one another, took Arms at length both at a time. Iacopo posted himself
towards the Gate that goes to Florence, and Bastiano towards that which leads to Lucca.
At first it was in debate severally by each of them, whether they should call in the Floren|tines;
but finding Castruccio more active, and his Forces better Soldiers, each of them sent
privately to him to solicit his assistance: Castruccio carried it very demurely, and promised
succour to both. He told Iacopo, that in person he would relieve him; and to Bastiano he
sent word he would do it by Pagolo Guinigi his Lievtenant General, and the person of the
world he loved best, for he regarded him as his Son. Having acquainted them both that
they should expect their supplies about midnight, he agreed with Pagolo, and causing him
to march with part of his Troops to joyn with Bastiano at one Gate, he with the rest ad|vanced
the common Road towards Iacopo. At both Gates they were admitted as Friends;
but no sooner were they entered, but upon a signal given, Bastiano was killed on one side
with all his chief friends, and Iacopo and his friends scaped no better on the other; the rest
of their parties betaking to their heels, the whole Town was left at Castruccio's devotion.
He came in person to reassure the Magistrates, and brought them out of the Palace whither
they had fled to secure themselves; Having called the people together, the promised to
cancel all the old debts, did many acts of Grace, lessened their imposts, and prevailed upon
them to be obedient, by the force of his caresses, and new priviledges which he gave them.
This profuseness of kindness, had coax'd likewise the Inhabitants of the Country, they
came in great throngs to salute and recognize their new Prince, who sent them all home
again in peace, all mightily taken with his Virtues, and possessed with hopes of his extra|ordinary
benefits.
There was about this time some Mutinies in Rome, by reason of the dearness of provi|sions.
The scarcity that was suffered, proceeded from the absence of the Popes, who kept
then their Pontifical residence at Avignon, and it added much to the revolt, that the Ro|mans
could not endure to be governed by a German. This National animosity was the
occasion of frequent Murthers, and perpetual disorder. Errico the Emperor's Lieutenant
General found himself too weak to apply any remedy, and apprehended (not without
cause) that the Romans had private intelligence with the King of Naples, that if their For|ces
should joyn, he should be forced out of Rome, and the Pope be restored. He concluded
therefore his safest recourse would be to Castruccio; so that he sent to him for supplies, and
begg'd of him that he would come along with them in person. Castruccio made no scruple
of the Voyage, being equally transported to be able to do a meritorious piece of service to
the Emperor, and put himself in a condition to be regarded at Rome, and look'd upon as
the Moderator of their affairs whenever the Emperor should be absent. Leaving therefore
the care of Lucca to the charge of Pagolo Guinigi, and contenting himself only with a Con|voy
of two hundred Horse, he came to Rome, and was received by Errico with all possible
honour. His presence having received the Authority of the Emperor, he took a gentle way
to pacifie the people. The first thing he did, was to provide plenty of all things, causing
store of Corn to be brought thither from Pisa, to take off the pretence of their revolt: After
which mingling very discreetly his favours and his chastisements, he reduced all the chief
Citizens to their obedience to Errico; In acknowledgment of which Castruccio was made
Senator of Rome, and several Honours conferred upon him with more than ordinary Cere|mony.
The day of his promotion, he came forth in a Habit sutable to his Dignity, but
enriched with a delicate Embroidery, with two devices wrought in artificially, one before
and the other behind; The first was before, and in these words, (as devout, as common)
HE IS AS IT PLEASES GOD; and behind in these, AND SHALL BE WHAT
GOD WILL HAVE HIM.
Whilst these things were in Transaction, the Florentines incensed that to the prejudice
of their Truce, Castruccio had surprised the Town of Pistoia, resolved to recover it by force
and thought it not likely to be difficult, if they took the opportunity of his absence. Among
the Fugitives from Pistoia who had saved themselves in Florence, there were two princi|pally
considerable, Cecchi, and Baldini. They were Men in Action, and had always retain'd
a private correspondence with their Friends in Pistoia; and they managed all things so dex|terously
for a revolt, that they caused a good party of Florentines to enter one night into
the Town, who restored them their liberty, with the destruction of all Castruccio's party

This news being brought to Rome, touched Castruccio to the quick, who taking leave of
Errico, with large Journeys came directly to Lucca.
The Florentines had notice of his return, and resolved stoutly to begin the War upon
him, that he might not have leisure to prepare; wherefore having obliged all that (like
themselves) were favourers of the Guelfish Faction, to put themselves forward in some
extraordinary manner, they raised a strong Army, and marched with all diligence to possess
themselves first of the Valley of Nievole to facilitate their Communication with Pistoia;
Castruccio on his side with what Forces he could get together, marched directly for Monte-Carlo,
and having intelligence where the Enemy was encamped, and how numerous their
Army, he judged the danger would be as great should he go and confront them in the plain
of Pistoia, as to attend them in the Valley of Pescia. He concluded therefore to draw them
(if he could) into the streights of Seravalle, for narrow passes, and rough and difficult
ways were convenient for a small Army as his was, which consisted of not above 12000
Men, and would be a disadvantage to the Florentines, who were 40000 compleat. Where|fore,
though he was well enough satisfied of the Courage of his Army, and understood the
worth of every common Soldier, yet he thought good to withdraw out of that Champagn
Country, lest he should suffer himself to be overwhelmed with the multitudes of his
Enemies.
Seravalle, is a Castle betwixt Pescia, and Pistoia, situate upon a hill which on that side
puts a stop to the Valley of Nievole. This Castle stands not upon the Road, but is about
two flight shot higher, and the passage down into the Valley, is rather strait than sleep, for
the declension is very gradual to the place where the waters divide, and pass to discharge
themselves into the Lake of Tucechio and that passage is so streight, that twenty Men in
Front, take up the whole breadth. There it was that Castruccio designed to engage the
Enemy, as well to give the advantage of the streight to the smallness of his own Army; as
to keep them from being sensible of the vast numbers of the Florentines; and prevent the
terror which they might inspire The Castle of Seravalle belong'd to the Signor Manfredi
a German, who had made himself Lord of it, long before Castruccio had seized upon Pistoia,
and kept it by common consent both of the Inhabitants of Pistoia and Lucca. Either because
he kept his Neutrality very strictly with both, or because the Castle was so strong of it self
it needed to fear neither. Castruccio knowing the importance of that place from the begin|ning
found a way to gain intelligence with a person who lived in the Castle. The night
before the day of the Battel, by the ministry of this Man, Castruccio caused Four hundred
of his Soldiers to enter, who cut the Throat of Manfredi, and seized on the Castle. Having
secured so considerable a Post without noise, he endeavoured to persuade the Enemy that
he would not stir from Monte-Carlo, thereby to draw them into his Clutches, and make
them hast with all speed to gain the avenues to the Val de Nievole, and this plot of his
jump'd exactly with the Florentine design. For they having no mind that Pistoia should be
the Theatre of the War, and being willing to remove it into the Vale, they encamped above
Seravalle, with intention to have passed the Streights the next day, not imagining in the
least that the Castle was surprized. Castruccio having notice of their motion; about mid|night
drew his Army out of their quarters, and stole privately before break of day to the
foot of Seravalle, The accident was odd, for as he marched up the Hill on one side, the
Enemy marched up on the other: caused his Foot to advance by the way of the com|mon
Road, but he drew out a party of Four hundred Horse, and commanded them towards
the left, on that side towards the Castle. There were Four hundred of the Enemies Horse,
that were a Forlorn to their Army, and the whole Infantry followed them, but their Scouts
were no sooner upon the top of the Hill, when on a sudden they fell foul upon the Troops
of Castruccio. They were strangely surprized for knowing nothing of the taking of the
Castle, they could not imagine the Enemy would come to meet them: Insomuch that before
they had leisure to put themselves into a posture, they were constrained to engage tumul|tuosly
with those Troops which were drawn up in good Order, but they in confusion;
Not but some of the Florentine Cavaliers behaved themselves gallantly, but the noise of
so unexpected an Encounter, put them presently to a stand, and being defused in the
Army, it put all into great disorder and fear. The Horse and the Foot fell foul upon one
another, and both upon the baggage: Want of ground rendered the Experience of the
Officers of no use, and the streightness of the pass, confounded all their Military cunning.
The first Troops that Castruccio charged upon the top of the Hill, were immediately routed
and the small resistance they made was not so much the defect of their courage, as the effect
of the place, with the incommodity of which, and the strangeness of the surprize, they were
constrained to give ground. There was no way left for them to run; on their Flanks the
Mountains were inaccessable, their Enemies were in the Front, and their own Army in the

reer. In the mean time, as this first charge of Castruccio was not sufficient to stagger the
enemies Battel, he drew out a party of Foot, and sent them to joyn with the Horse in the
Castle of Seravalle: this body in reserve having possession of the Hills, and falling upon
the flank of the Florentines, forced them to give ground, and yield to the wild incom|modity
of the place, and the violence and fierceness of the enemy. The Reer-guard ran,
and having got into the plain that looks towards Pistoia, every man shifted as well as he
could.
This defeat was bloody and great; among the multitude of prisoners, there were many
of the principal Officers; among the rest three Noble Florentines, Bandino di Rossi, Fran|cesco
Brunilleschi and Giovanni della Tosa, without mentioning several considerable Tuscans,
and many of the King of Naples his Subjects, who, by their Princes order, were in the ser|vice
of the Florentine. Upon the first tidings of their defeat, the Pistoians turned the
Guelfs Faction out of Town, and came with their keys and presented them to Castruccio,
who pursuing his Victory, carried Prato and all the Town in that plain, as well beyond as
on this side the Arno: after which he encamped with his Army in the plain of Peretola,
two miles from Florence, where he continued braving the City, and passed several days in
the enjoyment of his good fortune, parting the spoil, and coining of mony, thereby exer|cising
with great ostentation a kind of Soveraign right over their Territory; and releasing
something of the rigour of his discipline, he gave his Soldiers liberty to insult as they pleased
over the conquered; and to make his triumph the more remarkable, nothing could serve
the turn, but naked women must run Courses on horse-back under the very walls of the
City. But this gallantry and ostentation entertained him but lightly, or rather served but
as a colour to hide his greater designs; for in the mean time he found a way to corrupt Lu|pacci,
Frescobaldi, and some certain other Gentlemen in the Town, who were to have de|livered
him a Gate, and brought him into Florence in the night, had not their Conspiracy
been discovered, and defeated afterward by the punishment of the accomplices.
This great Town being so streightned, and so long block'd up, that the Inhabitants seeing
no other way of preserving their liberty, than by engagig it to the King of Naples, sent
Embassadors to that Prince, and offered to throw themselves into his arms. It was not
only for his honour to accept of their proffer, but for the general interest of the whole Fa|ction
of the Guelfs, which without that could subsist no longer in Tuscany. The terms be|ing
agreed, the treaty concluded, and the Florentines to pay him annually two hundred
thousand Florens, he sent them four thousand Horse under the Command of Prince Carlo
his Son.
During this negotiation an unexpected accident hapned, which put Castruccio into a
cooler temper, and made him give the Florentines breath in spight of his teeth: there was
a new Conspiracy against him at Pisa, not to be suppressed by his presence: Benedetto Lan|franchi,
one of the chief Citizens in the Town, was the author of it: Benedetto troubled
to see his Country subject to the tyranny of a Lucchese, undertook to surprize the Citadel,
force out the Garison, and cut the throats of all that were friends to Castruccio. But as in
those kind of conjurations, if a small number be able to keep things secret, it is not suffici|ent
to put them in execution; and therefore whilst Lanfranchi was endeavouring to hook
in more associates, he met with those who were false, and discovered all to Castruccio. Two
Noble Florentines, Cecchi and Guidi, who were fled to Pisa, were suspected to be the Trai|tors;
and the suspicion of that perfidy left an ill stain upon their reputation; which way
soever it was, Castruccio put Lanfranchi to death, banished his whole Family, and several of
the chief Pisans were left shorter by the head.
This plot discovering to Castruccio that the fidelity of the Towns of Pistoia and Pisa
would be always easily shaken; he put all things in practice that cunning or open force
could suggest to keep them in their duties: but whilst his thoughts were upon the tenters
about so important a care, the Florentines had some respite to recover their Senses, and ex|pect
the Neapolitan Succours, which being at length arrived under the Conduct of Prince
Carlo, a general Counsel was held of the whole Faction of the Guelfs. Upon the resoluti|on
taken there, an Army was raised, the strongest that ever had been set out by that party,
for it amounted to 30000 Foot; and 10000 Horse. When their Forces were ready, it was
debated in the Counsel of War, whether they should begin with the Siege of Pistoia or Pisa.
The latter carried it, for it was fancied the Conspiracy of the Pisans was so recent, that in
probability it had left some seeds for a second revolt; besides, the Conquest of Pisa would
bring Pistoia along with it.
This great Army opened their Campagn in the beginning of May 1328. Lastra, Signia,
Monte Lugo and Empoli were taken immediately, and it advanced afterwards to besige San-Miniato.
But Castruccio without discomposure, either by the greatness of their force, or

the swiftness of their progress, believed rather that the favourable instant was arrived in
which fortune was to put into his hands the supreme authority of Tuscany; and therefore
judging this effort of the enemy at Pisa would succeed no better than their designs at Sera|valle,
he came and entrenched at Fucechio with 20000 Foot, and 4000 Horse, having put
5000 Foot into Pisa under the Command of Pagolo Guinigi.
Fucechio is a Castle seated so advantagiously, that there is not a better Post in all the plain
of Pisa; for it stands upon a little eminence equally distant from the two Rivers Arno and
Gusciana. The place of their encampment could have been no where better chosen, for un|less
the enemy divided, and came upon them in two Bodies, (which must needs weaken them
much,) they could not cut off the provisions which came to Castruccio both from Lucca and
Pisa. To come and face them in their trenches, would be rashly to engage themselves be|twixt
his Army and Pagolo's. To turn towards Pisa, they must pass the River Arno, and
leave the enemy upon their backs, which was an attempt as dangerous as the other. Ca|struccio's
design was to make them pitch upon the last, and to invite them the better to
pass over the River; instead of bringing down his Line to the bank, (as he might very
well have done,) he turned it off short towards the walls of Fucechio, not so much to shel|ter
himself under the said walls, but cunningly to leave the enemy such a space free, as
might tempt them to pass the River. And in the whole art of War, there is nothing so
subtil as the election of Posts and Encampments, and that was Castruccio's master|piece.
The enemy having taken San. Miniato, consulted for some time whether they should fall
upon Pisa, or Castruccio in his Camp: at length, all things well considered, it was conclu|ded
to march straight toward him. The River Arno was at that time so low, it was forda|ble,
but with trouble, for the Horse pass'd up to the saddle, and the Foot with proportion.
At last on the 10th of Iune in the morning, the Florentines put themselves into Battalia,
and began to pass the River with a party of their Horse, and a body of 10000 Foot. Ca|struccio
having deliberated all things, and provided for more than one Event, commanded
a thousand Foot along the River, above the passage where the enemy appeared, and sent a
thousand more to post themselves below it; and then advancing himself at the head of
five thousand Foot and three thousand Horse, he came on couragiously against the enemy,
as half of them were passed. The Florentine Foot, tired with the incommodity of their
passage, and the weight of their Arms, advanced but faintly against him; and for their
Horse, they that passed first had made the bottom so loose, and so slipperry, that there was
no passage for those who were to follow: on the contrary, their Horses either stuck fast in
the mud, or their legs came up, and they threw their Riders into the water, where many of
them were drowned. So that the Florentines perceiving their attempt there was not like
to succeed, recovered the bank, and marching a little higher, they searched for a better place:
but where-ever they made their point, and endeavoured to go over, Castruccio opposed them
with the Infantry he had drawn out, which being arm'd lightly with Targets and Darts,
were every where immediately, charged the enemy both in the Front and the Flank, and
setting up at the same time most hideous shouts, the Florentine Horse being frighted with
noise, and wounded with Darts, either run back, or threw their Riders under their feet. As
to the Florentines who had passed first, they maintained their ground with a great deal of
Gallantry, and till then the loss was equal on both sides; for if Castruccio doubled his en|deavours
to force back the enemy into the River, the enemy was no less zealous to gain as
much ground as might serve for drawing up their Army when it should get over. Both
Generals were very busie in the encouragement of their Souldiers, both with exhortation
and example. Castruccio, to vilifie the enemy, remonstrated to his Army, that they were
the same people they had beat before at Seravalle; the Florentines represented to their
Troops how infamous it would be for so numerous an Army as theirs to be worsted by a
handful of men. But Castruccio, observing the Battel grew tedious, and his own men be|gan
to be as weary as the enemy, and that there were as many wounded and dead on the
one side as the other, he caused another Body of five thousand Foot to advance; as soon as
they were got up to reer of their companions, those who had been fighting all the
while, and were then in the front, were commanded to open to the right and left, and
wheel off into the reer, whilst the other advanced into the ground they had forsaken; but
whilst this was in agitation, the Florentines gained something upon them, but they enjoyed
it not long, for being to deal with fresh men, they were quickly disordered, and followed
with that vigour, they threw themselves into the River. As to the Horse both of the one
side and the other, no advantage was to be observed. Castruccio being sensible that in num|ber
his was much inferior to the enemy, had commanded his Troops to entertain their
Horse with slight skirmishing, only to gain time; for believing his Foot able to beat the

enemies, he intended afterwards to joyn them with his Horse, and fall both together upon
the Cavalry of the Florentines. The Florentines tried another passage above the first,
thinking thereby to have flanck'd Castruccio afterwards; but the bank on the other side be|ing
bad, and defended by the enemies Foot, they were repulsed again, and in as great disor|der
as before. Then Castruccio came up to them, and charged them so smartly in all parts,
that they were totally defeated; so that of so vast an Army, scarce a third part were saved,
and several of their chief Officers taken. Prince Carlo saved himself at Empoli with
Michael Falconi, and Thadeo Albizi, Commissaries General of the Florentine Army;
one may easily imagine the plunder was great, and the slaughter no less. In short, accord|ing
to the exactest computation, there were slain on the Florentine side 20231 men; on the
side of Castruccio but 1570.
Here it was that Fortune began to be weary of the great actions of Castruccio, and (in|constant
as she was) instead of giving him long life that might have crown'd his felicity
as if she had been jealous of his glory, she interposed with the only obstacle that was able
to interrupt the prosperity of so incomparable a man.
This Illustrious Hero tired with the fatigues of a Battel, as painful as glorious; coming
out of the Fight with his imagination full of great things that might follow, and running
over in his mind the probability of his good fortune, believing no hopes were left for the
enemies loss, nor no bounds for his victory, he marched directly for the Gate of Fucchio.
It having been always his principle to be first on horseback, and last that came out of the
field, he rested there some time, not out of ostentation, but to thank and caress the Souldiers
as they returned from the pursuit, and withal to be ready, in case the enemy should rally.
Whilst he was standing there, covered with sweat, his heart panting, and out of breath,
an unlucky cold wind came from the other side of the Arno, and with a pestiferous quality
so affected his blood, that he fell immediately into the cold sit of an Ague: at first he neg|lected
it, though he found a general alteration, as believing himself sufficiently hardned
against the injuries of the air; but this negligence was very pernicious. The next night
his Fit increased, and his Fever was so violent, his Physitians gave him over.
The universal sadness of the Souldiers made his triumphant Troops look as melancholy
as if they had been beaten. All his Officers stood about him with tears in their eyes, but
having taken then particularly by the hand, and desired them to withdraw, he caused Pa|golo
Guinigi to be called, took him in his arms, and with a feeble but affectionate voice, he
spake to him as follows. Had I imagined (dear Son) that fortune would have stop'd my
course in the midst of the way that conducted me to Glory, and so soon interrupted the
felicity of my Arms, I would have better enjoyed the fruit of my pains. 'Tis possible I
should not have left your Territory so large, but I should have endeavoured to have left
it more quiet, by creating fewer enemies to my self, and less envy to you. I should have
contented my self (dear Son) with the Sovereignty of Lucca and Pisa, and instead of in|tending
the Conquest of Pistoia, and contracting the hatred of the Florentines by so many
affronts, I should have endeavoured by all means possible to have gained their affection:
by so doing, if I had not lengthened my days, I should have made them at least more
happy, and left you more quiet and secure. But fortune (who will have the ordering of
all humane affairs) gave me not so much judgement as was necessary to know her, nor so
much time as was requisite to master her, You have heard (for every body has told you,
and I never denied it) how I came into your Father's house, young, inconsiderable, with|out
hopes of advancement; in a word, in so mean a condition, that without his kind|ness
I could never have satisfied the ambition of my nature. Your Father brought me
up with the same care and tenderness as if I had been his own, and I do acknowledg,
if ever I gave any testimonies of Valour and Magnanimity, they were but the effects of
those great examples which he set me, and the fair education I had from him, condu|cted
me to that height which, not only you, but all the World has admir'd. When he
came to die, he committed to my care and faith both your person and interest; have I be|traid
his confidence in any thing? can you complain that my generosity has not been an|swerable
to his? my heart does not reproach me by any ingratitude. I have not only
preserved to you the fortune of your Father; but to leave you the fruit of my labours
and success, I have declined all overtures of Marriage, lest hapning to have children of
my own, my natural affection for them should have destroyed my friendship for you; and
lessened the acknowledgment which I owed to his bounty. It touches, it touches, dear
Charge, when we speak of these things. You cannot comprehend the satisfaction I re|ceive,
to leave you Master of so puissant a State; nor can you imagine how it troubles me
to leave it so unselted and perplexed. The City of Lucca is under your subjection, but
be sure 'tis not pleased with its condition: Pisa likewise is yours, but you know the natu|ral

inconstancy of that people. Though it has been often subdued, and passed from one
servitude to another, yet it will always disdain to pay obedience to any native of Lucca,
and have a care how you regulate your Politicks in relation to this jealousie, which is inse|parable
from persons of different Countries. The Town of Pistoia is a place that ought
always to leave upon your spirit some suspition and umbrage of their fidelity. Besides, that
it is divided within it self, the ill treatment which it has received from us will most sensibly
excite it against our Family. But the worst of all is, the Florentines are your neighbours,
and you know mortally offended, as having been worsted by me perpetually: but that is
not sufficient to suppress them. They will be now overjoy'd and insult more upon the
news of my death, than if they had conquered all Tuscany. As to the Succours, you are
to expect I will not dissemble with you: you can hope for none but from the Emperor,
or Princes of Milan, and you will be deceived if you expect any from them; they are
either too slow, or too busie, or too remote. Depend not therefore upon any thing but
your own Conduct, upon the memory of my Atchievements, and the consternation which
my Victory has brought upon our enemy. It will be no little advantage to you if you
can allure the Florentines to an accommodation, and their fear, without doubt, sufficiently
inclines them. Let your comportment with them for the future be different from mine;
and as I have always provoked them, and believed nothing could so much contribute to
my happiness, as to deal with them as enemies, let it be your care to desire their amity, and
found not your repose upon any thing so much as an alliance with them. Nothing in this
life imports us so deep as the knowledg of our own tempers, and how to employ them; but
this Science belongs most properly to those who would govern; and it is necessary for
such to spin out their lives in the luxuries of peace, when they find themselves unfit for
warlike executions: my advice therefore (dear Charge) is, that you would live in repose,
and if you will make the advantage of the troubles of my life to sweeten your own, you
will remember to follow it. Farewel, I am going, and with this double satisfaction, that
as I have left you the possession of a large Empire, so I have left you such percepts as will
secure it to you.
Castruccio ended this passionate discourse by griping Pagolo by the hand, who heard him
all the while with tears in his eyes: and as the last instance of his gratitude, this great per|son
called for all the brave and faithful Officers of his Army, whether of Lucca, Pisa, or
Pistoia, and having recommended to them the interests of Pagolo, he obliged them to an
oath of Allegiance, and as soon as that oath was solemnly taken, the great Conqueror sur|rendred
his soul. Never was victorious Army so sad, never any Prince so lamented, nor
any memory so venerable. His exequies were honourably celebrated, and his body buri|ed
in the Church of St. Francis in Lucca. Pagolo succeeded, but not with the virtue and
fortune of his predecessor; for not long after he lost Pistoia, and then Pisa, and much ado
he had to keep the Sovereignty of Lucca, yet that continued in his Family to the fourth
Generation.
These great actions do sufficiently prove that Castruccio was not only a man rare in his
own age, but would have been the same in any former. His stature was higher, and his
proportions better than ordinary: his aspect was charming, and he had so much grace and
goodness in his accost, that never man went unsatisfied from his conversation: his hair was
inclining to red, and he wore it short above his ears: where-ever he went, snow, hail, or
rain, let the weather be what it would, his head was always uncovered. He had all the
qualities that make a man great: grateful to his friends, terrible to his enemies, just with
his subjects, crafty with strangers, and where fraud would do the business, he never troubled
himself to conquer by force. No man was more forward to encounter with danger, nor
no man more careful to get off. He used to say that men ought to try all things, and be
terrified at nothing; for it was clear God Almighty was a lover of Courage, because he
made valiant men the Ministers of his judgments, and corrected the poor spirited by them.
He had a strange presence of wit, and made his reparties with admirable quickness; he
would rally very handsomly, sometimes he would be pleasant and innocent, and sometimes
as bitter, and poinant. When occasion offered fairly, as he never spared any body, so he
was never offended when he was bitten himself. We have some of his answers which
he gave with much wit, and others of other peoples which he heard with as much
patience.
He caused a Bird to be bought one day, and gave a Ducat for it; one of his acquain|tance
blaming him for giving so much: you (says Castruccio) would have given a penny
for it your self? the other answering yes; then (says Castruccio) you would have paid
dearer than I, for a Ducat is not so much with me.
Having a Flatterer about him who plagued him with perpetual requests, in great scorn

Castruccio spit upon his Clothes: The Flatterer reply'd wittily, a Fisherman to get a pitiful
little fish, is dabbled up to the neck, and shall I be afraid of a little spittle, that am catching
a Whale. Castruccio was pleased with his answer, and rewarded him for it.
A certain Hypocrite who loved his gut as well as he, reproached Castruccio one day, b
the Luxury and Extravagance of his Table. If that were a sin (replyed Castruccio) the
would not be so much feasting upon Holy-days.
Passing one day thorow a street, where there lodged certain Women of but indifferen
reputation, and seeing a young man come from them who blushed, had was in mighty con|fusion
that Castruccio had seen him; Friend, says Castruccio, You should not be ashamed when
you come out, but when you go in.
He was always of an opinion that a Conqueror ought not to give too much liberty to his
new Subjects, which upon a time he explained very subtilly to some who understood him;
Having a knot given him that was very fast tyed, he was desired to undo it, and having
tryed a good while to no purpose, My Friend (said he a loud) If a thing that is tyed can
give me so much trouble, I shall be much worse when once it is loosed.
He was often troubled with the assiduities of a person who pretended to be a Philosopher,
and was always molesting his Entertainments with his admonitions and Morals; Castruccio
weary of his insolence at his Table, told him, You Philosophers are like Dogs, you never go
any where but where you may have something to bite. The Philosopher replyed, No Sir, we
are more like Physicians, and go only to those who have extraordinary need of us.
Passing one day from Pisa to Legorn by water, a great tempest arose on a sudden, and put
Castruccio into some apprehension, which one of the Company observed, and told him by
way of reproach, that he wondered such a man as Castruccio should be frighted, when he
found no such passion in himself. Castruccio replyed, you have no reason Sir to be afraid;
for every man values his life according to its worth.
One asked him one time what he should do to make himself esteem'd; he replyed, when
you'r invited to a Feast, have a care you do not set a wooden Statute upon a joyn'd stool.
A fellow boasting to him one day how many Books he had read, Castruccio told him,
It would have been more credit to have remembred half of them.
A great Drinker, who was aways debauching, used to value himself very much upon
this score, That though his Belly was always full of Wine, he never was drunk. Castruccio
told him, a Quart pot was the same.
A Friend of his seeing him engaged in a amour with a very pretty young Lass, blamed
him very seriously that he suffered himself to be so taken by a Woman, you are deceived Sir,
said he, she is taken by me.
One found fault with him exceedingly for being so delicate and so expensive in his dyet;
You would not (said Castruccio) spend half so much in yours? and being answered no, Then
(replyed Castruccio) you are a greater Miser, than I am an Epicure.
He was invited one evening to Supper bp Faddeo Bernardi, a Lucchese, a very rich and
sumptuous Citizen; being arrived at the house, and conducted by Faddeo into a Room, ex|ceedingly
well hung, the Pavement of Mosaique work, wrought curiously into Flowers,
and Leaves, and Branches, which yielded a most excellent verdure. Castruccio admir'd it
exceedingly, and pretending to have occasion to spit, he turned about, this way and that
way, and at last spit in Faddeo's face; Faddeo was much troubled, but Castruccio excused
it, and told him, He thought he could have spit no where to have offended him less.
One asking very seriously how Caesar died? He answered as seriously, Would I might
die like him.
One of his Courtiers having an ambition to regal him, made a Ball one night, and invited
him to it; Castruccio came, entertained himself among the Ladies, and being in a good
humour, fell a dancing and solacing among them, and doing some impertinencies which
did not stand with the gravity of his rank: being admonished by one of his Friends that it
would detract from his esteem; He told him, I thank you Sir for your caution, but he that is
counted wise all day, will never be thought a fool at night.
One coming to him to beg a boon that Castruccio was unwilling to grant, Castruccio de|clined
him, and would not seem for to hear; whereupon the Petitioner threw himself upon
the ground, and put his head to Castruccio's feet; Castruccio reproving him, the other
replyed, You your self are the cause, you heard so little when I stood up, I had a mind to see
whether your Ears were upon your Toes. Which answer got him more than he desired.
He was wont to say, The way to Hell was very easie, for Men went thither upon their
backs, and could find it with their eyes shut.
Another desiring a favour of him, with a thousand impertinent and superfluous words:
Hark you Friend, says Castruccio, when you would have any thing with me for the future,
send another Man to beg it.

Another great talker having tired him with a tedious discourse, excused himself at last
and told him he was a fraid he had wearied him, No indeed Sir, reply'd Castruccio, for I did
not mind one word that you said.
He used to Droll upon a person, who having been a handsom boy, prov'd as handsom a
Man, His spight (said he) has been always against Married people: when he was a boy he
debauched Men from their Wives, and now he debauches Women from their Husbands.
He saw an envious man laugh, and asked him, Do you laugh, said he, That things go well
with your self, or ill with other people.
When he was under the Tutelage of Francesco Guinigi, one of his Comerades asking
him merrily, what he should give him for a box at his Ear, Castruccio answered immediatly,
a Helmet if you please.
He was forced to put a Citizen of Lucca to death, who formerly had been a great instru|ment
of his advancement; and being reproached by some body, for dealing so severely
with an old friend; No, says he, you are mistaken, it was with a new foe.
Castruccio compared the prudence of those persons, who though they pretended to Marry,
would never be brought to't, to the discretion of those people, who though they talk'd
much of going to Sea, kept constantly at Land.
He used to say, he wondered much at one Custom among men: when they buy any
thing curious, either of Christal or Glass, they sound it, and employ all their senses to be
sure it be good; but in choosing of a Wife, they use nothing but their sight, as if she was
taken only to be look'd upon.
He was of opinion that after his Death there would be a general alteration; and being
asked when he came to die, how he would be buried, he replyed, With my face downward,
for I am sure in a short time this Country will be turned topsie turvey, and then I shall be in the
same posture with other men.
Whil'st he was in controversie with Huguccione, but had him in great veneration for his
bravery and Conduct; being asked in discourse whether for the salvation of his Soul, he
never had any thoughts of turning Monk, he answered no, for to him it seemed very strange
if Frier Lazarone should go to Paradise, and Huguccione de Faggivola to Hell.
Being asked what time was most proper for a Man to Eat, to keep himself in health, he
answered, The rich when they are hungry, and the poor when they can.
Seeing a Friend of his make use of his Servant to put up his Breeches, he told him, I hope
e're long, you'l have one to feed you.
Seeing over the door of a certain person this Inscription in Latin, God keep this House
from ill people; He cryed, Then the Master must never come in to't.
Passing by a little House with a great Gate, he said, If they have not a care, this House
will run away thorow the Gate.
Being in discourse with the Ambassador of the King of Naples about the settlement of
their Frontiers; upon some controversie betwixt them, the Ambassador ask'd him in a
huff, Why then Sir you are not afraid of our King? Castruccio replyed gently, is your King
a good a man, or a bad? being answered a Good; Why then, said Castruccio, would you have
me afraid of a good man?
We might add many other answers of his, all full of weight, as well as wit; but these
shall suffice. He dyed in the 44th year of his Age, and from the time he came first to ap|pear
in the world, in his good and his bad fortune he expressed always an equality and
steddiness of spirit; and as he left several Monuments of his prosperity and good fortune
behind him; so he was not ashamed to leave some memorials of his adversity: When he
was delivered from Huguccione's imprisonment, he caused the Irons with which he was
manacled, to be hung in the publickest place in his Palace, where they are to be seen to
this day, being willing that posterity might know, that how fortunate soever he was in the
main, he was not totally exempt from distress.
That which is still remarkable is, that having equalled the great actions of Scipio and
Philip the Father of Alexander, he died as they did in the 44th. year of his Age, and
doubtless he would have surpassed them both, had be found as favourable dispositions at
Lucca, as one of them did in Macedon, and the other in Rome.



A Narrative of the Murther of Vitellozzo Vitelli,
Oliveretto da Fermo, Signor Pagolo, and the
Duke de Gravina, (all of the Family of the Ursini)
the one committed by Duke Valentine, and the other
composed by Nicolo Machiavelli.
DUke Valentine was returned from Lombardy, whither he had gone to excuse him|self
in relation to certain Calumnies objected against him by the Florentines a|bout
the revolt of Arezzo, and other Towns in the Vale de Chiana, and being
come to Imola, upon consultation with his Friends, he concluded upon his expedi|tion
against Giovanni Bentivogli Sovereign of Bolonia, because Duke Valentine had a mind
to reduce that City, and make it chief of his Dutchy of Romagna; of which the Vitelli, Orsini,
and their followers having notice, it appeared to them all, that the said Duke Valentine
grew too potent, and that upon the taking Bolog, it was to be feared, he would endea|vour
to exterminate them, and make himself the only great man in Italy. Hereupon a
Dyet was held at Magione in Perugia, where thee met the Cardinal Pagolo, the Duke de Gra|vina
Orsini, Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliveretto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, Sovereign of Peru|gia,
and Antonio da Venafro sent from Pandolfo Petrucci, as head of Sienna. Upon serious
deliberation about the greatness and disposition of the Duke, it was concluded very neces|sary
to restrain him in time; otherwise there was great danger of a General destruction.
Resolving therefore to desire aid of the Florentines, and to continue their amity with the
Bentivogli, they sent Embassadors to both; promising their assistance to the one, and beg|ging
the assistance of the other against the Common Enemy. This Dyet was quickly nois'd
all over Italy, and such of Duke Valentine's Subjects as were discontented (among whom
were the Urbinati) began to hold up their heads, and hope for a revolution. While the
people were in this suspence, certain of the Inhabitants of Urbino, laid a plot to suprize the
Castle of San. Leo, which at that time was kept for the Duke, and the manner was thus; The
Governor of the Castle was busie in repairing it, and mending the fortifications, to which
purpose having commanded great quantities of Timber to be brought in, the Conspirators
contrived that certain of the biggest pieces should be laid (as by accident) upon the bridge,
which they knew could not be cran'd up without a great deal of difficulty; whil'st the
Guards were employed in hoysting the Timber, they took their opportunity, seized upon the
Bridge, and then upon the Castle, which was no sooner known to be taken, but the whole
Country revolted and called in their old Duke; yet, not so much upon the surprize of that
Castle, as their expectations from the Dyet at Magione, by means of which they did not
question to be protected. The Dyet understanding the revolt of Urbino, concluded no
time was to be lost, and having drawn their Forces together, they advanced, if any Town
was remaining to the Duke, to reduce it immediately. They sent a new Embassy to the
Florentines to solicite their Concurrence against the common Enemy; to remonstrate their
success, and to convince them that such an opportunity being lost, was not to be expected
again. But the Florentines had an old pique to the Vitelli and Ursini upon several accompts,
so that they did not only not joyn with them, but they sent their Secretary Nicolo Machia|velli
to the Duke to offer him reception of assistance which he pleased to Elect. The Duke
was at Imola at that time in great consternation; for unexpectedly on a sudden, when he
dream'd nothing of it, his Soldiers revolted, and left him with a War at his Doors, and
no force to repel it: But taking heart upon the Florentine Complement, he resolved with
the few Forces he had left, to protract, and spin out the War, and by propositions and pra|ctices
of agreement, gain time till he could provide himself better, which he did two ways,
by sending to the King of France, and by giving advance Mony to all Men at Arms and
Cavalry that would come in. Notwithstanding all this, the Ursini proceeded, and marched
on towards Fossombrone, where being faced by a party of the Dukes, they charged them,

and beat them: The news of that defeat, put the Duke upon new Counsels, to try if he
could stop that humour by any practice of accord; and being excellent at dissembling, he
omitted nothing that might persuade them that they were the Aggressors and had taken up
Arms first against him: That what was in his hands, he would willingly surrender; that
the Name of Prince was enough for him, and if they pleased, the Principality should be
theirs; and he deluded them so far, that they sent Signor Pagolo to him to treat about a
Peace, and in the mean time granted a Cessation of Arms: However the Duke put no stop
to his recruits, but reinforced himself daily with all possible diligence; and that his sup|plies
might not be discovered, he dispers'd them as they came, all over Romagna: Whil'st
these things were in transaction, a supply of 500 Lances arrived to him from France; and
though by their help he found himself strong enough to confront his Enemy in the field,
yet he judged it more secure and profitable to go on with the cheat, and not break off the
Capitulation that then was on foot: And he acted it so well, that a Peace was concluded;
their old Pensions confirmed, 4000 Duckats paid down, a solemn engagement given not to
disturb the Bentivogli; He made an alliance with Giovanni, and declared that he could not,
and had no power to constrain any of them to come personally to him, unless they pleased
to do it themselves. They promised on their part to restore the Dutchy of Urbino, and
whatever else they had taken from him; to serve him in all his Enterprizes: not to make
War without his leave; nor hire themselves to any body else. These Articles being sign'd,
Guid' Ubaldo Duke of Urbin fled again to Venice, having dismantled all the Castles and
strong holds in his Dutchy before he departed; for having a confidence in the people, he
would not that those places which he could not defend himself, should be possessed by the
Enemy, and made use of to keep his friends in subjection.
But Duke Valentine having finished the agreement, and disposed his Army into quarters
all over Romagna, about the end of November, removed from Imola to Cesena, where he
continued several days in consultation with certain Commissioners sent from the Vitelli, and
Ursini (who were then with their Troops in the Dutchy of Urbino) about what new Enter|prize
they were next to undertake; and because nothing was concluded, Oliverotto da Ferno
was sent to propose to him, if he thought good, an expedition into Tuscany; if not, that
they might joyn, and set down before Sinigaglia. The Duke replyed, That the Floren|tines
were his Friends, and he could not with honour carry the War into Tuscany, but their
proposal for Sinigaglia, he embraced very willingly. Having beleaguer'd the Town, it
was not long before they had News it was taken, but the Castle held out; for the Governor
refused to surrender to any body but the Duke, whereupon they intreated him to come.
The Duke thought this a fair opportunity, and the better because he went not of himself,
but upon their invitation; and to make them the more secure; he dismissed his French,
and sent them back into Lombardy (only he retained a hundred Lances under the Com|mand
of his Kinsman Monsieur de Candale.) Departing about the end of December from
Cesena, he went to Fano, where with all the cunning and artifice he could use, he persua|ded
the Vitelli and Ursini to stay with the Army till he came; remonstrating to them that
such jealousies and suspicions as those, must needs weaken their alliance, and render it
undurable; and that for his part he was a man who desired to make use as well of the
Counsels, as the Arms of his Friends. And though Vitellozzo opposed it very much,
(for by the death of his Brother he had been taught how unwise it was to offend a Prince
first, and then put himself into his hands) nevertheless persuaded by Paulo Ursino (who un|derhand
was corrupted by presents and promises from the Duke) he consented to stay. Here|upon
the Duke upon his departure the 30th of Decemb. 1502. imparted his design to Eight
of his principal intimates (amongst whom Don Michael, and Monsignor d' Euna were two)
and appointed, that when Vitellozzo, Pagolo Ursini, the Duke de Gravina, and Oliverotto
should come to meet him, two of his Favourites should be sure to order it so, as to get one of
the Ursini betwixt them, (assigning every couple his man) and entertain them till they
came to Sinigaglia; with express injunction not to part with them upon any terms till they
were brought to the Dukes Lodgings, and taken into Custody. After this he ordered his
whole Army, Horse and Foot (which consisted of 2000 of the first, and 10000 of the latter)
to be ready drawn up, upon the banks of the Metauro, about five miles distant from Fano,
and to expect his arrival. Being come up to them upon the Metauro, he commanded out
two hundred Horse as a Forlorn, and then causing the Foot to march, he brought up the
Reer himself with the remainder.
Fano, and Sinigaglia, are two Cities in la Marca, seated upon the bank of the Adriatick
Sea, distant one from the other about 15 miles; so that travelling up towards Sinigaglia,
the bottom of the Mountains on the right hand are so near the Sea, they are almost wash'd
by the water,  at the greatest distance they are not above two miles. The City of Sinigaglia

from these Mountains is not above a flight shot, and the Tide comes up within less than a
Mile. By the side of this Town there is a little River, which runs close by the wall next
Fano, and is in sight of the Road: So that he who comes to Sinigaglia, passes a long way
under the Mountains, and being come to the River which runs by Sinigaglia, turns on the
left hand upon the bank, which within a bow shot, brings him to a Bridge over the said
River, almost right against the Gate: before the Gate there is a little Bourg with a Market-place,
one side of which, is shouldred up by the bank of the River. The Vitelli, and Ursini,
having concluded to attend the Duke themselves, and to pay their personal respects, to make
room for his Men had drawn off their own, and disposed them into certain Castles at the
distance of six miles, only they had left in Sinigaglia, Oliveretto with a party of about 1000
Foot, and 150 Horse which were quartered in the said Bourg. Things being in this order,
Duke Valentine approached, but when his Horse in the Van came up to the Bridge, they did
not pass, but opening to the right and left, and wheeling away, they made room for the
Foot, who marched immediately into the Town. Vitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke de Gra|vina,
advanced upon their Mules to wait upon Duke Valentine; Vitellozzo was unarm'd in a
Cap lin'd with green, very sad and melancholy, as if he had had some foresight of his desti|ny,
which considering his former courage and exploits, was admired by every body: And it
is said, that when he came from his house, in order to meeting Duke Valentine at Siniga|glia,
he took his last leave very solemnly of every body. He recommended his Family and its
fortunes, to the chief of his Officers, and admonished his Grand-children, not so much to
commemorate the fortune, as the magnanimity of their Ancestors. These three Princes being
arrived in the presence of Duke Valentine, saluted him with great civility, and were as civilly
received; and each of them, (as soon as they were well observed by the persons appointed
to secure them) were singled, and disposed betwixt two of them. But the Duke perceiving
that Oliveretto was wanting (who was left behind with his Regiment, and had drawn it up
in the Market-place for the greater formality,) he wink'd upon Don Michael (to whom the
care of Oliveretto was assign'd) that he should be sure to provide he might not escape. Upon
this intimation, Don Michael clap'd spurs to his Horse, and rid before, and being come up
to Oliveretto, he told him it was inconvenient to keep his Men to their Arms, for unless
they were sent presently to their quarters, they would be taken up for the Dukes; where|fore
he persuaded him to dismiss them, and go with him to the Duke. Oliveretto following
his Counsel, went along with him to the Duke, who no sooner saw him, but he call'd him
to him, and Oliveretto having paid his Ceremony fell in with the rest. Being come into
the Town, and come up to the Duke's Quarters, they all dismounted, and attended him
up, where being carried by him into a private Chamber, they were instantly Arrested and
made Prisoners. The Duke immediately mounted, and commanded their Soldiers should
be all of them disarmed; Oliveretto's Regiment being so near at hand, were plundered into
the bargain. The Brigades which belong'd to Vitelli, and Ursini being at greater distance,
and having notice of what had hapned to their Generals, had time to unite, and remem|bring
the Discipline and Courage of their Masters, they kept close together, and marched
away in spight both of the Country people, and their Enemies. But Duke Valentine's Sol|diers,
not content with the pillage of Oliveretto's Soldiers, fell foul upon the Town, and
had not the Duke by the death of several of them, repressed their insolence, Sinigaglia had
been ruined. The night coming on, and the tumults appeased, the Duke began to think
of his Prisoners, resolved Vitellozzo, and Oliveretto should die, and having caused them to
be guarded into a convenient place, he commanded they should be strangled; but they said
nothing at their deaths, that was answerable to their lives; for Vitellozzo begged only that
the Pope might be supplicated in his behalf, for a plenary indulgence. Oliveretto impeached
Vitellozzo, and lay'd all upon his back. Pagolo and the Duke de Gravina were continued
alive, till the Duke had information that his Holiness at Rome had seized upon the Cardinal
Orsino, the Arch-bishop of Florence, and Messer Iacopo da Santa Croce; upon which News,
on the 18th of Ianuary, they also were both strangled in the Castle of Piene after the same
manner.



THE
STATE
OF
FRANCE,
IN
An Abridgment written by Nicolo Machiavelli,
Secretary of FLORENCE.
THE Kings and Kingdom of France are at this time more rich and more power|ful
than ever, and for these following Reasons: First,
The Crown passing by succession of Blood is become rich, because in case
where the King has no Sons to succeed him in his paternal Estate, it falls all
to the Crown; and this having many times hapned, has been a great corroboration, as
particularly in the Dutchy of Anjou; and at present the same is like to fall out to this
King, who having no Sons, the Dutchy of Orleans, and State of Milan (his heredi|tary
Countries) are like to devolve upon the Crown: So that at this day most of the good
Towns in France are in the Crown, and few remaining to particular persons.
A second great Reason of the strength of that King is, That whereas heretofore France
was not entire, but subject to several great Barons, who were able not only to expostulate,
but to contend with the King (as the Dukes of Guienn and Burbon did formerly) the said
Barons are now most obsequious and dutiful.
A third reason is, because formerly all the neighbouring Princes were ready upon every
occasion to invade the Kingdom of France; the Dukes of Burgundy, Britannie, Guienne
or Flanders, being always tempting them thereunto, and giving them access, passage, and
reception, as it hapned when the English had Wars with France, by their Confederacy
with the Duke of Britagne, they got admission into that Country, and gave the King of
France his hands full: and in like manner the Duke of Burgundy was as troublesom, by
means of the Duke of Bourbon. But now Britagne, Guienne, the Bourbonois, and greatest
part of Burgundy being united to that Crown, and very loyal and faithful; Those neigh|bouring
Princes do not only want their old Confederates to invite and assist them, but they
have them for their Enemies; so that the King of France is more strong, and his Adver|saries
more weak.
Another reason may be, That at this day the richest and most potent of the Barons are of
the Blood Royal; so that upon defect of those who are before them, the Crown may come
to them, upon which score they are firm to it, hoping that some time or other it may fall
either to them or their posterity, whereas to mutiny or oppose, it might prejudice their
succession, as it hapned to this King Lewis when he was taken in the Battel of Britagne,
where in favour of the said Duke of Britagne, he was personally in Service against the
French. Upon the death of King Charles, the Crown being legally in Lewis, it was dis|puted
whether that fault and defection of his should not be a bar to his succession, and
had it not been that he was very rich, by means of his frugality, and able to bear the Port
of that Dignity at his own expence, and the next Heir Monsigneur d' Angolisme an Infant,
he had lost it; but for these reasons, and some favour which he had besides, Lewis was
created King.

The last reason is, because the States of the Barons in France are not divided among the
Heirs, (as in Germany, and several parts of Italy) but descend still to the Eldest Son who
are the right Heirs; and the younger Sons are left, by some little assistance from their
Elder Brothers to shift for themselves; whereupon they betake themselves generally to the
Wars, endeavouring to advance themselves that way, and raise themselves fortunes: and
hence it is the Frenchmen at Arms are better at this day, and stand fair for preferment.
The French Infantry cannot be good, for it being long since they had any War, they must
needs want experience. Besides in the Country, the Towns are full of Tradesmen and
Mechanicks, all of them so curb'd and cow'd by the Nobless, that they are grown pusil|lanimous
and base; and therefore the King of France having found them unfit, makes no
use of them in his Wars, unless it be of his Gascoigns who are something better than the
rest, and the reason is, because bordering upon the Spaniards, they are constantly upon
duty, or communicate something of their Nature: But for some years since they have
shown themselves better Theives than Soldiers; nevertheless in defending and assaulting of
Towns they do well enough, but in the field they are but indifferent, quite contrary to
the Germans and Swizzers, who are not to be dealt with in the field, but in storming or
defending a Town, they are good for nothing; and I suppose it proceeds from hence that
they cannot in both cases keep the same order which they observe in the field. Wherefore
the King of France makes use of Switzers, and Lanzknights, because his men at Arms dare
not rely upon his Gascoignes in time of Service. And if his Foot were as good as his Men
at Arms, no doubt but the King of France would be able to defend himself against all the
Princes in Europe.
The French are naturally more fierce and hot, than dexterous or strong, and if resisted
handsomly in their first charge, they slacken and cool, and grow as timerous as Women.
They are likewise impatient of distress or incommodity, and grow so careless by degrees,
that 'tis no hard matter, finding them in disorder, to master and overcome them.
And of this, Experience has been many times had in the Kingdom of Naples, and last of
all at Farigliano, where they were twice as many as the Spaniards, and it was expected
every hour when they should have swallowed them up: Nevertheless, because winter came
on, and the weather grew bad, they began to straggle into the Neighbouring Towns,
where they might be at more ease, and thereby leaving their Camp weak, and out of order,
the Spaniards fell upon them, and beat them beyond all expectation. And it would have
been the same with the Venetians, who had never lost the Battel of Vaila, had they forborn
following the French example but for ten days: But the fury of Bartolmeo d' Alviano was
too hot for them. The same hapned again to the Spaniards at Ravenna, who might have
certainly ruined the French in respect of their ill Government, and want of provisions
which were intercepted on that side towards Ferrara by the Venatians, and towards Bologna,
by the Spaniards themselves; but by the rashness of some, and the indiscretion of others,
the French got the Victory, and though as it was, it was bloody enough; yet it had been
much more, had the strength of either Army consisted in the same kind of men; but the
French force lying in his Men at Arms, and the Spaniards force in their Foot, the slaughter
was the less. He therefore who would conquer the French, must be sure to preserve him|self
against their first impetus and attack, and in so doing he shall be sure to prevail; for Cae|sar's
character of them is true, At first they are more than Men, at last less than Women.
France in respect of its greatness, and the convenience of its Rivers, is opulent and rich;
for their Commodities and labour are worth little or nothing, by reason of the scarcity of
Money among the people, which is so great, it is with difficulty that they are able to raise so
much as will pay the impositions of their Lords, though they are generally but small; the
reason is, because every body gathers to sell as he has occasion, and no body can stay to
finish his harvest as it should be. So that if there should be any body (which is seldom seen)
so rich as to be a bushel of Corn beforehand, every body having of their own, there would
be no body to buy it: and the Gentlemen, of what they receive of their Tenants, except
it be for cloths, spend little or nothing; For Cattle, and Poultry, and Fish, and Venison,
they have enough of their own: so that all the Mony comes into the hands of the Lords,
and doubtless at this time they are exceedingly rich, for the people are so poor, he that has
but a Floren, believes himself a Prince.
The Prelates of France carry away  of the Revenue of that Kingdom, because there are
several Bishops who have Temporal as well as Spiritual Revenues, who having provisions
enough of their own to keep their houses, spend not one farthing of their income, but hoard
it up according to the Natural covetousness of the Prelates, and Religious; and that which
accrews to the Chapters and Colledges, is laid out in Plate, and Jewels, and Ornaments,
for the decoration of their Chappels; so that betwixt what is laid out upon their Churches,

and what is laid up by the Prelates, their money and their movables is of an immense va|lue.
In all Counsels for the Government and Administration of the affairs of that King|dom,
the Prelates are always the greatest number, the other Lords not regarding it so much,
as knowing the execution must come thorow their hands: so that both sides are contented,
one to ordain, the other to execute, though there are many times some of the ancienter and
more experienced Souldiers taken in to direct the Prelates in such things as are out of their
sphear.
The Benefices in France (by virtue of a Custom and Law derived anciently from the
Popes) are conferred by the Colledges; insomuch as the Canons, when their Arch-Bishop,
or Bishop dies, calling an Assembly, to dispose of their Benefices to them that are thought
most worthy, whence it comes that they are frequently divided among themselves, because
as many are prefer'd by favour and bribery, as by piety and worth: and it is the same with
the Monks in the election of their Abbots. The other inferior Benefices are in the Gift of
the Bishops. If the King at any time would intrench upon this Law, and choose a Bishop
at his own pleasure, he must do it by force; for they will deny him possession; and though
perhaps it be forc'd, that King is no sooner dead, but his Bishop shall be sure to be dispos|sessed,
and another put in his place.
The French are naturally covetous, and desirous of other peoples goods, which they
will lavish and squander as prodigally as their own: a French-man shall cheat, or rob you,
and in a breath meet, and eat, and spend it as merrily with you as you could have done your
self; which is contrary to the humour of the Spaniard; for if he gets any thing of you,
you must look for nothing again.
The French are in great fear of the English, for the great inroads and devastations which
they have made anciently in that Kingdom; insomuch, that among the common people the
name of English is terrible to this day; those poor wretches not being able to distinguish
that the French are otherwise constituted now than they were then; for that now they are
Armed, good Souldiers, and united, having possession of those States upon which the Eng|lish
did formerly rely, as the Dutchy of Burgundy, and the Dutchy of Britagne; and on
the other side the English are not so well disciplin'd; for 'tis so long since they had any War,
there is not a man of them living who ever look'd an enemy in the face; and besides, there
is no body left to joyn with them, if they should land, but only the Arch-Duke.
They are afraid likewise of the Spaniards, by reason of their sagacity and vigilance.
But when-ever that King invades France, he does it with great disadvantage; for from the
place from whence he must march, to that part of the Piraneans by which he must pass in|to
France, the distance is so great, and the Country so barren, that every time the Spaniards
attempt any such thing, either by the way of Perpignan, or Gehenna, they must needs be
much incommoded, not only for want of supplies, but for want of victuals to sustain them
in so tedious a march; because the Country behind them is scarce habitable for its fertility,
and that which is inhabited has scarce wherewithal for the Inhabitants; so that in these
respects, towards the Piraeneans, the French are in little apprehension of the Spaniard.
Of the Flemmings the French likewise are in no fear; for, by reason of the coldness of
their Country, they do not gather enough for their own subsistance, especially of Corn and
Wine, with which they are forced to supply themselves out of Burgundy, Piccardy, and other
places in France. Moreover, the people of Flanders live generally of their own manu|facture,
which they vend at the Fairs in France, that is, at Paris and Lyons, for towards the
Sea-side they have no utterance for any thing, and towards Germany 'tis the same; for there
are more of their Commodities made than in Flauders: so that when ever their Commerce
with the French is cut off, they will have no where to put off their Commodities, nor no
where to supply themselves with victuals: so that without irresistible necessity the Flemmings
will never have any controversie with the French.
But of the Swizzers the French are in no little fear, by reason of their vicinity, and the
sudden incursions to which they are subject from them, against which it is impossible to
make any competent provision in time, because they make their depredations and incursions
with more ease and dexterity than other Nations, in respect that they have neither Artillery
nor Horse; but though the French have Towns and Countries very near them, yet being
well fortified and mann'd the Swizzers never make any great progress. Besides, the dispo|sition
of the Swiss is apter to battel and fighting in the field, than to the storming or defen|ding
of Towns: and it is very unwillingly (if ever) the French come to cope with them
upon the Frontiers; for having no foot that is able to bear up with the Swizzers, their
Men at Arms without Foot can do nothing: moreover, the Country is so qualified, that
there is not room enough for the Men at Arms and Cavalry to draw up, and manage to ad|vantage,

and the Swizzers are not easily tempted from their borders into the plain, nor to
leave such strong and well provided Towns (as I mentioned before) upon their backs,
left by them their supplies should be intercepted, and perhaps their retreat be ob|structed.
On the side towards Italy they are in no fear, in respect of the Apenine Mountains, and
the strong places which they have at the foot of them: so that who-ever invades the Do|minion
of France in those parts, must be sure to overcome, or by reason of the barrenness
of the Country about, he will hazard to be famished, or compelled to leave those Towns
behind him which would be madness, or to attaque them at disadvantage, which would be
worse: so that on the side of Italy they are in no danger, for the resons abovesaid; and
moreover, there is not a Prince in Italy able to undertake him, nor are the Italians now in
such unity as in the days of the Romans.
Towards the South, the Kingdom of France is in no apprehension, because it is washed
by the Sea on that side, and accommodated with Ports always full of Ships, (partly of the
Kings, and partly of other petty Princes) sufficient to defend their Coasts from any sud|den
impression; and against any thing premeditated, they will have time enough to pre|pare;
for it requires time to make a solemn invasion, and the preparation will be discovered
by some body, besides, for further security, there are always parties of Men at Arms scowring
upon the Coasts.
Their expence in keeping of their Towns is not so great; for the French Subjects are ve|ry
dutiful, and the fortresses are not kept at the charge of the Kingdom, and on the bor|ders
(where Garisons, and by consequence, expence would be more necessary) those flying
bodies of Men at Arms save them that charge: for against any extraordinary insult, there
will be time enough to provide, for that requires time to be fitted, and more to be execu|ted.
The people of France are very humble and obedient, and have their King in mighty ve|neration.
They live at very little expence, by reason of their great plenty, and every body
hath something of his own: their clothing is course, of very cheap stuff, and they use no
kind of Silks, neither the men nor the women; for if they should, they should be obnoxious
to the Gentry, who would certainly be even with them.
The Bishopricks in France, according to modern computation, are 146, and the Arch-Bishopricks
18.
The Parishes are reckoned a million and 700, and the Abbies 740. Of the Priories there
is no account.
Of the ordinary and extraordinary Entries of the Crown, I could get no exact account,
I inquired of several, and all told me they were as the King pleased to require. Yet some
persons told me that that part of his ordinary Revenue which arises out of his Gabels upon
wine, and bread, and flesh, and the like, amounts to a million and seven hundred thousand
Crowns: and his extraordinary, by Taxes, amounts as he pleases: but in case they fall short,
he has another string to his bow, and that is by way of loans, which are seldom repaid.
The Letters to that purpose do commonly run thus: Sir, The King recommends himself to
you; and having at this time pressing occasion for mony, He desires you would furnish him with
the sum contained in this Letter; which sums are paid in to the next Receiver, and there
are of them in every Town who receives all the profits and revenue accrewing to the
King by Gabels, Taxes, Loans, or otherwise.
Those Towns which are subject to the Crown, have no rules or orders but what His
Majesty is pleased to set them for raising of mony either by Taxes or otherwise.
The authority of the Barons over their Subjects, and half their Revenues consists in
bread, and wine, and flesh, as abovesaid, and so much a year for hearth-mony, but it must
not exceed six pence or eight pence a hearth, to be paid every three months. Taxes and
Loans they cannot require without the consent of the King, which he grants very
rarely.
The Crown receives no other advantage from them than in the revenue for salt, and ne|ver
taxes them but upon extraordinary occasion.
The King's order in his extraordinary expences both in War and Peace, is to command
the Treasurers to pay the Souldiers, which they do by tickets of assignment. The Pen|sioners
and Gentlemen repair to the Generals with their tickets from month to month,
where they are entred, and having received a new policy from three months to three months,
the Pensioners and Gentlemen go then to the Receivers of the respective Provinces where
they live, and are paid immediately.
The Gentlemen belonging to the King are 200, their pay 20 Crowns a month; and
paid as abovesaid, each hundred has a Captain.

The Pensioners are no set number, and their Pensions are as uncertain, being more or less
as it pleases the King: they are in a way of preferment, and therefore there is no exact
rules for them.
The office of the Receivers General of France, is, to receive so much for fire, and so
much for taxes by consent of the King; and to take care that both ordinary and extraor|dinary
expences be paid at the time, and discharges given as aforesaid.
The Treasurers have the keeping of the mony, and pay it according to their orders from
the Generals.
The office of the Grand Chancellor is judicial land definitive, he can pardon and con|demn
as he pleases, and that even in Capital Causes, without the consent of the King. In
Causes where the Clients are contumaciously litigious, He can prefix them a day for the de|termination
of their Suit: He can confer Benefices, but that must be with the King's con|sent,
for those grants are pass'd by the King's Letters under the Broad-Seal, wherefore that
Seal is kept by the said Chancellor. His salary is 10000 Franks per an. and 11000 more
for his Table, which Table is intended for the repast and entertainment of such Gentle|men,
Lawyers and Counsellors as follow in his train, when they think fit either to dine or
sup with him.
The sum which the King of England received annually from the King of France was
fifty thousand Franks, in consideration of certain disbursements by the present King of
England's Father in the Dutchy of Britagne, but the time of that payment is expired.
At present there is in France but one Grand Seneschal, when there are more, (I do not
mean Grand Seneschals, for there is never but one) their authority is over the Militia
both in Ordinary and Extraordinary, whom for the dignity of their Office they are ob|liged
to obey.
The Governors of the Provinces are as many as the King pleases, and have their Com|mission
for life or years, and their Salaries great or little, as he thinks good to appoint: the
other Governors, to the very inferior Officers in every little Town, have all their Commis|sions
from the Kings, for you must know there is no office in that Kingdom, but is either
given or sold by that King.
Of the quantity of distributions for the Gentlemen and the Pensioners, there is no cer|tain
account, but as to them, the King's warrant is sufficient, for they are not liable to the
Chamber of Accounts.
The Office of the Chamber of Accounts is to view and audit the accounts of all such
as have any thing to do in the King's Moneys, as the Generals, the Treasurers, and the Re|ceivers.
The University of Paris is paid out of the Rents of the Foundations of the Colledges,
but very narrowly.
The Parliaments are five, of Paris, of Roan, of Tholose, Burdeaux and Douphine, from
either of which there is no appeal.
The Universities first were but four, at Paris, Orleans, Bourgi and Poictiers, to which
these at Tours and Angiers have been added since, but they are very inconsiderable.
The standing Army is a great (both for number of Men and Artillery) as the King
pleases, and are quartered and disposed according to orders from him. Yet every great
Town upon the Frontiers have Artillery and Ammunition of their own, and within these
two years several more have been cast in several places of the said Kingdom, at the charge
of the Town where they were made, and to re-imburse themselves, the are allowed a Toll
of a penny an head for all Cattel, and as much for every bushel of Corn, whilst the King|doms
is under no danger of invasion. The standing Force is divided into four Bodies,
which are disposed into four several Posts for the security of the Country, that is to say, into
Guienna, Piccardy, Burgundy, and Provence, but not precise number is observed in any, for
they are lessened, or encreased, and removed from one place to another, as they have occasion
to suspect.
I have with some diligence inquired what moneys were assigned every year for the
charges of the King's Houshold, and his privy Purse, and I find it is what he pleases him|self.
His Archers are four hundred, design'd for the Guard of his Person, among which there
are two Scotch. Their Salary is three hundred Franks a man every year, and a Coat of
the King's Livery. But there are 24 constantly at the King's elbow, and their Salary is 400
Franks per an.
His German Foot-Guards consisted formerly of three hundred men, with each of them
a Pension of ten Franks a month, and two Suits of Apparel a year, that is, Coats and Shooes,
one for Summer, and the other for Winter; but of these Foot there were 100 parti|cularly

near the King, their Salary being 12 Franks per mens. and their Coats of Silk, which
was begun in the time of King Charles.
The Harbingers are those who are sent before to take up Lodgings for the Court, they
are 32 in number, and each of them has a Salary of three hundred Franks every year, and
a Coat of the King's Livery. Their Marshals or chief Officers are four, and have each of
them 600 Franks per an. In taking up their Lodgings, their method is this; they divide
themselves into four parties, one Marshal (or his Lieutenant, in case he cannot wait him|self)
stays where the Court departed, to see all things rectified betwixt the followers of the
Court, and the Masters of the Houses: another of them goes along with the Court; a
third where the King lies that night; and the fourth where he lies the next, by which
means they keep so exact an order, that they are no sooner arrived, but every man knows
his Lodging, and is furnished with every thing got ready to his hand.
The Provost del Hostel is a person who follows always the person of the King, and his
office is judiciary: where-ever the Court goes, his Bench is the first, and in all Towns
where he comes the people may appeal to him as to their Lieutenant. His ordinary Salary
is 6000 Franks. He has under him two Judges in Civil Causes, paid by the King, each of
them 600 Franks per an. he has likewise under him a Lieutenant Criminal, and 30 Archers
paid as abovesaid. Those who are taken by this Provost upon any criminal account, cannot
appeal to the Parliament. He dispatches all both in Civil and Criminal affairs, and if the
Plaintiff and Defendant appear once before him, it is enough, their business is deter|mined.
The Masters of the King's Houshold are eight, but there is no certain rule for their Sa|lary,
for some have 1000 Franks per an. some more, some less, at it pleases the King, over
whom there is a Grand Master with a Salary of 11000 Franks per an. and his authority is
only over the rest.
The jurisdiction of the Admiral of France is over all the Fleet, and Ships, and Ports be|longing
to that Kingdom: He can seize, and make what Ships he pleases, and dispose of
them as he thinks good when he has done. His Salary is 10000 Franks.
The Knights of the King's Order have no certain number, depending wholly upon the
King's pleasure. When they are created they swear to defend the Crown, and never up|on
on any terms to be engaged against it: they can never be degraded or deprived of their
Dignity but by death. The highest of their Pensions is 4000 Franks per an. some have
less, for all are not equal.
The Chamberlains office is to wait upon the King, to see to his Chamber, and to advise
him: and indeed his Chamberlains are persons of the principal reputation in his Kingdom:
their Pensions are six, eight, and ten thousand Franks per an. and sometimes nothing, for
the King does often confer those Places upon some great and rich stranger, whom he has a
mind to oblige: but though they have no Pensions, they are exempted from all Gabels, and
have their diet in Court at the next Table to the King's.
The Master of the Horse is to be always about the King; his authority is over the
12 Quieries, and the same that the Grand Seneschal, the Grand Master, and the Grand
Chamberlains is over those who are under them. He has the care of the King's Horses,
and Harness, helps him up and down, and carries the Sword before him.
The Lords of the King's Council have Pensions of betwixt six and eight thousand
Franks Per an. at the pleasure of his Majesty; their names at present are, Monseigneur di
Parigi, Mons. di Buonaglia, the Baylif of Amiens, Mons. du Russi, and the Grand Chancel|lor;
but Rubertet, and Mons. di Parigi govern all.
There is no Table kept for them since the death of the Cardinal of Roan, for when the
Grand Chancellor is absent, Parigi does that office for him, and takes them with him.
The Title which the King of France pretends to the State of Milan, is thus; His Grand-father
married a Daughter of the Duke of Milan, who died without Heir males.
Duke Giovanni Galeazzo had two Daughters women grown, and I know not how many
Sons. Of the Ladies, one was called Madona Valentina, and was married to Lewis Duke
of Orleans, Grand-father to this present King, descended lincally from King Pipen. Duke
Iohn Galeazzo being dead, his Son Philip succeeded him, who died without legitimate issue,
leaving only one natural Daughter behind him. Afterwards that State was usurped ille|gally
by the Sforzeschi, as is reported, because they pretend it fell to the Heirs of the said
Madona Valentina, and that from the very day in which the Duke of Orleans married with
the House of Milan, he added to the three Lillies in his Coat of Arms, the Snake, which is
to be seen at this day.
In every Parish in France there is a person called a Frank Archer, who is paid by the Pa|rish,
and is obliged to be always ready with a good Horse and Arms to wait upon the King

when ever they are required, whether abroad in time of War, or at home upon any other
occasion: they are bound likewise to ride up and down for the security of such places as are
liable to in-roads, or any ways suspected; and, according to the number of the Parishes,
they are 1700000 men.
Their Lodgings are appointed by the Harbingers according to every mans office, and
usually the richest men quarter the greatest Courtiers; and that neither the Lodger nor
Landlord may have reason to complain, the Court has appointed a rate or rule to be ob|served
generally for all people, and that is a sous or penny a day for their Chamber; in
which there is to be bed, and chairs, and stools, and all things that are necessary.
There is an allowance likewise of two pence a day to every man for linen, (as towels and
napkins) and for vinegar and verjuice; their linen is to be changed at least twice every
week, but there being great plenty in that Country, they change oftner, as Lodgers desire
it; besides which, they are obliged to keep their beds made, and their chambers swept and
clean.
There is allowance likewise of two pence a day for the standing of every man's horse;
they are not bound to provide any thing for them, only to keep their stalls clean, and carry
out the dung.
Some there are who pay less, as their Landlords are good natured, or they can make any
shift: but this is the ordinary rule of the Court.
The English Title to the Crown of France, upon my best inquiry, I find to be thus:
Charles the sixth of France married his lawful Daughter Katharine to Henry the fifth, Son
and Heir to Henry the fourth, King of England: In the articles of Marriage, (no notice
being taken of Charles the seventh, who was afterwards King of France) besides the
Dower that was given with Katharine, Charles the sixth, Father to the said Katharine insti|tuted
Henry the fifth of England (his Son in Law, and to be married to the said Katharine)
Heir to that Kingdom of France: and in case the said Henry should die before the said
Charles, and the said Henry leave Sons that were legitimate behind him, that then the Sons
of the said King Henry should succeed to the said Kingdom of France, upon the death of
the said, Charles the sixth; which was contrary to Law, because Charles the seventh was
prejudiced thereby, and was afterwards of no validity or effect: against which the English
pretend that Charles the seventh was illegitimate.
The Arch-Bishopricks in England are two.
The Bishopwricks two and twenty, and
The Parishes 52000.



THE
STATE
OF
GERMANY
IN
An Abridgment written by Nicolo Machiavelli,
Secretary of FLORENCE.
OF the power of Germany no body can doubt, because it a bounds so exceedingly
in Men, and Money, and Arms. As to its wealth, there is not a Free Town
in the whole Country, but has a publick stock aforehand of its own; and some
say Argentina (Strasburg) alone has a Million of Florens constantly in bank.
The reason of their opulence is because they have nothing to exhaust them,
but their Fortifications, and furnishing their Magazines (for reparations, and recruits
cost them but little.) In the latter they have a very good way, for they have always in their
publick Stores, Meat and Drink, and Firing for a Twelve-month: Besides, to entertain
the industry of their people, they have wherewithal to set the poor on work, in case of any
Siege, a compleat year together, so as they may subsist upon their own labour, without
being burthensom to the Town. Their Souldiers are but little expence to them for they
are always well arm'd, and well exercised; and on their Festival days, instead of the Com|mon
recreations, one takes his Musket, another his Pike, one one sort of Arms, another
another, and practising among themselves, they grow very ready and dexterous; and
after they are arrived at some degree of perfection, they have certain Honours and Salaries
conferred upon them, which is the greatest part of their charge. So that in every free
Town the publick Treasury is rich.
The reason likewise why the private persons are rich, is this because they live with
great parsimony, and indeed little better than if they were poor; for they are at no expence
in their Clothes, their Buildings, nor the furnishing of their Houses. If they have bread,
and flesh, and any thing to keep them from the cold, they are well enough; and he that
wants them, is contented, and makes some shift or other without them. Two Florens
will serve them in Clothes ten years; and according to his degree every man lives at this
rate; they do not trouble themselves for every thing they want, but only for those things
that are absolutely necessary, and by that means their necessities are much fewer than ours:
The result of which Custom is this, their Mony goes not out of their County, they con|tenting
themselves with their own Native productions, whil'st in the mean time every man
is permitted to bring in what Treasure he pleases into Germany, to purchase their Commo|dities
and Manufactures which in a manner supplies all Italy; and their gain is so much
the more, by how much a small part of the profit of their labours, recruits them with
Materials for new.
Thus do they live at liberty, and enjoy their own humors; for which reason they will
not be got to the Wars, but upon extraordinary pay and that will not do it neither, un|less
they be commanded by their own Magistrates; Wherefore an Emperor has need of
more Mony, than another Prince, because if men be in a good condition already, they are
not easily allured to the Wars.

As things stand now, the free States must unite with the Princes, before any great ex|ploit
can be undertaken by the Emperor; or else they must enterprize it themselves, which
they would be able to do. But neither the one nor the other desires the greatness of the
Emperor; for if ever he should get those Free States into his hands, he should be strong
enough to overpower the Princes, and reduce them to such a degree of subjection, that he
would manage them as he pleased himself, as the Kings of France have done formerly in
that Country, and particularly King Lewis, who by force of Arms, and the cutting off
some few Persons brought them to their present obedience. The same thing would happen
to the States, if the Princes should be cajoled, they would lose their freedoms, be wholly at
the disposition of the Emperor, and be forced to be satisfied with what he would vouchsafe
to afford them. The distance and division betwixt the free States and the Princes, is sup|posed
to proceed from the different humors in that Country, which in general are two;
The Swissers are become Enemies to all Germany, and the Princes to the Emperor. It may
seem strange perhaps, that the Swissers, and free States should be at variance and enmity,
seeing the preservation of their liberty, and securing themselves against the Princes, is the
common interest of both: But their discord is from this, that the Swissers are not only Ene|mies
to the Princes, but to all Gentlemen whatever, and in their Country, they have nei|ther
the one, nor the other; but live without distinction of persons (unless in their Magi|strates)
in the most levelling liberty in the world. This practice of the Swissers makes all
the Gentlemen which are remaining in any of the free Towns afraid of them; so that they
employ their whole industry in keeping their States at a distance with them, and preventing
any intelligence betwixt them. Moreover all of those States who have been Soldiers, and
had their Education in the Wars, are mortally their Enemies moved thereunto by Emu|lation
and Envy, because they themselves are not so famous abroad, and their animosity is
so great, that they never meet in the sield (let their numbers be small, or great) but they
fall together by the Ears.
As to the Enmity betwixt the Princes, and the free Towns, and the Swissers, I need say
no more, it being so generally known; as likewise of the jealousies betwixt the Emperor
and the Princes. You must understand, that the Emperors principal apprehension is of the
Princes, and not being able to correct them alone, he has made use of the assistance of these
free States, and not long since, entertained the Swissers into his allyance, by whose means
he thought himself in a very good condition. So that these common dissentions being con|sidered,
and the particular piques and suspicions betwixt one Prince, and one State and
another; it is no easie matter to unite the Empire; and yet it is necessary it should be uni|ted,
before any great thing can be performed by the Emperor. And though he who believes
Germany in a condition to do great things, because there is visibly no Prince who has the
power, or indeed the courage to oppose the designs of the Emperor, as formerly has been
done, yet he must know that it is a great impediment to an Emperor not to be assisted by
those Princes, for though perhaps a Prince dares not contend with him, he dares deny him
his assistance; and if he dares not deny him that, he dares break his promise upon occasion,
and if he dares not do that, will at least mak so bold to deferr and delay the performance
so long, that when his supplies do come, they shall do the Emperor no good; all which
things do infinitely disturb, and embarras his designs. And this was found to be true,
when the Emperor would the first time have passed into Italy, in spight both of the French
and the Venetian; in a dyet held at that time in Constance, he was promised by the several Free
States in Germany a supply of ... thousand Foot, and 3000 Horse, yet he could never
get of them together above 5000, and that because by that time the Forces of one State
came up; another was ready to depart, their time being expired and some sent Mony in
lieu; upon which score that Enterprize was lost.
The strength of Germany consists in the free Towns rather, than in the Princes; for the
Princes are of two sorts, Temporal and Spiritual. The Temporal Princes are brought very
low, partly by themselves (every Principality, being cantonized and distributed to several
Princes by constitution of their inheritances which are observed very strictly in those
Countries) and partly having been much weakned by the Emperor and his assistance from
the said States; so that now the amity of the Temporal Princes, is of little importance.
There are likewise Spiritual Princes, whose Territories, if not cantonized and divided by
those Hereditary Customs, are yet so weakned and enervated by the ambition of their own
free Towns, and the favour that the Emperor showes them, that the Electoral Archbishops,
and the rest have little or no power in the great and chief Towns of their own Dominions;
from whence it comes to pass, that being divided at home, they cannot favour the Enter|prizes
of the Emperor, though they would themselves. But to come to the Free, and the
Imperial Towns, which are the strength of that Country, as being rich, and well-govern'd.

Those Towns for several reasons, are grown cooler in the assertion of their Liberties, and
much more in the acquisition of new, and that which they do not desire for themselves, they
do not care another should have. Besides they are so many; and every one to be comman|ded
by a General of their own, that their supplies, when they are disposed to send them,
come but very slow, and when they do come, are not so useful as they should be, and of
this we had an Example not many years since. The Swissers invaded the State of Maxi|milian,
and Suevia: The Emperor contracted with the Free Towns to repell them, and
they obliged themselves to assist him with an Army of 14000 Men, but he never got half of
them, and the reason was as abovesaid, when the Forces of one Town came up, another
marched off, insomuch that the Emperor dispairing of success, came to an agreement with
the Swissers, and left Basil in their possession. And if in this case, where their own interest
was concerned, they have acted at this rate, it may be guessed how they will behave them|selves
in the concerns of other men; so that all these things laid together, though their
power be great, yet it can turn but to little accompt to the Emperor. And the Venetians
by their conversation and Commerce with the Merchants of Germany, in all their Transa|ctions
hitherto with the Emperor, have understood him better than any body else, and dealt
more honourably by him; for had they been in any apprehension of his power, they would
have insisted upon some caution, either by way of Mony or Towns; and if they had seen
any possibility of uniting the whole power of the Empire, they would never have opposed
it: But knowing that to be impossible, it made them the more conident, and gave them
hopes of success. If therefore in a single City, the affairs of the multitude are negligently
managed, in a Province they will be much worse. Moreover those little States are sensible,
that an acquisition in Italy, or elsewhere, would fall to the Princes, and not to them, be|cause
they might enjoy them personally, which could not be done by a Common-wealth, and
where the reward is like to be unequal, people will not willingly be at an equal expence.
Their power therefore is great, but of little importance, and he who peruses what has been
said before, and considers what was been done for several years past, will sind how little it is
to be rely'd upon.
The German Men at Arms are well mounted, and many of them well enough arm'd, but
their Horses are heavy and unactive, and it is to be observed that in their Encounters with
the Italians or French, they can do nothing at all, not for any fault in the Men, but the
accoutrement of their Horses, for their Saddles being little, and weak, and without bows,
every little jostle tumbuls them upon the ground: and another of their great disadvantages
is, that the lower part of their bodies are never arm'd whereby not being able to defend
against the first impression (in which the excellence of those Soldiers consist) they lie ex|posed
(upon the close) to the short Swords of the Enemy, and may be wounded both
themselves and Horses in those disarmed places, and it is in the power of every Foot man to
pull them off on their Horses, and rip their Guts out when they have done, and then as
to the manage of their Horses they are too heavy to do any thing at all.
Their Foot are very good, and very personable men, contrary to the Swiss, who are but
small, rough hewn, and not handsome at all: But they arm themselves (unless it be some
few) only with a Pike and a Sword, that they might be the more dexterous, and nimble,
and light; and their saying used to be, that they arm themselves no better, because they
feared nothing but the Artillery against which no Breast-plate, or croslet, or Gorget would
secure them: other weapons they despise; for it is said their order is so good, and they
stand so firm to one another 'tis impossible to break into them nor come near them if their
Pikes be long enough. They are excellent in a Field sight, but for the storming of a Town
they are good for nothing; and but little to defend one: and generally where the Men
cannot keep their old orders and manage themselves with room enough, they are worth
but little: Of this experience has been seen where they have been engaged with the Italians,
or assaulted any Town, as at Padua where they came off very ill, though on the other side,
in the Field they had done well enough. For in the Battel of Ravenna, betwixt the French
and the Spaniards, if it had not been for their Lanceknights, the French had been beaten;
for whil'st the Men at Arms were confronted, and engaged with one another, the Spanish
had the better of the French, and had disordered their Gascoigns, so that had not the Ger|mans
came in and relieved them, they had been utterly broken: and the same was seen
lately when the Spanish King made War upon the French in Guienna, the Spaniards were
more fearful of a Body of 10000 German Foot, which the King of France had in his
Service than all the rest of his Army, therefore they declined coming to a Battel with all
the Art they could use.

NICOLO MACHIAVELLI
TO
ZANOBI BUOND ELMONTI
And COSIMO RUCELLAI.
I Send you a Present which (though not answerable to my obligati|ons)
is doubtless the greatest that Nicolo Machiavelli was able
to send, having expressed in it whatever I know or have learned
by a long practice, and continued reading of the affairs of this World
than which neither you nor any body else being to expect more, I am
not to be blamed if my Present be no better. You may complain in|deed
of the poverty of my parts, my narrations being so poor; and of
the weakness of my judgment, having perhaps mistaken in many
places of my Discourses: if so, I know not which of us is less obliged to
the other, I to you, for having forced me to write against my own in|clination,
or you to me, for having perform'd it no more to your sa|tisfaction.
Accept it then in the same manner as things are accepted
from friends, among whom the intention of the giver is always more
considered than the quality of the gift, and believe that as oft as I
think of it, I am satisfied in this, that however I have been mistaken
in many other circumstances, I have done wisely in this, having cho|sen
you above all others for the dedication of my Discourses, both be|cause
in not doing it, I should have shewn my self in some measure in|grateful
for the benefits received, and in doing it, I have trans|gressed
the common custom of Authors, who for the most part direct
their Works to some Prince, and (blinded with ambition and avarice)
applaud and magnifie him for all the virtuous qualities, when per|chance
they ought rather to have reproached him with all the vices
imaginable. To avoid that error, I have made choice, not of those
who are actually Princes, but of such as by their infinite good parts
do merit to be so; not of those who are actually able to advance me
to Honours, Employments, and Wealth, but to those, who though un|able,
would do it if they could: for, to judge right, men are rather to
esteem those in whose nature, than those in whose power it is to be li|beral,
and those who understand how to govern a Kingdom, than
those who do govern it without that understanding. Accordingly
Authors do commend Hiero the Syracusan, though but a private
person, above Perseus of Macedon, though a great King: because
to Hiero there was nothing wanting to be an Excellent Prince, but
a Principality; and Perseus had nothing but a Kingdom to recom|mend
him to be King. Accept then) whether it be good or bad)
what you commanded your selves, and if you be so far in an error
as to approve my opinions, I shall not fail to pursue the rest of my
History, as I promised in the beginning. Farewel.

LIBER. I.
COnsidering with my self what honour is given to Antiquity, and how many times
(passing by variety of instances) the fragment of an old Statue has been pur|chased
at an high rate by many people, out of curiosity to keep it by them, as an
ornament to their house, or as a pattern for the imitation of such as delight in
that art; and with what industry and pains they endeavour afterwards to have it repre|sented
in all their buildings. On the other side, observing the most honourable and heroick
actions (describ'd in History, perform'd by Kingdoms and ancient Common-wealths; by
Kings, great Captains, Citizens, Legislators, and others, which have not only tired, but
spent themselves in the service of their Country) are rather admir'd than imitated, and in|deed
so far shun'd and declin'd, in all places, there is scarce any impression or shadow to be
seen in this age of the virtue of our ancestors; I could not at the same time but admire,
and lament it; and the more, by how much I observed in all civil and personal controversies,
in all diseases incident to mankind, recourse is continually had to such judgments and re|medies
as have been derived to us by our predecessors; for to speak truth, the Civil Law
is nothing but the sentence and determination of their fore-Fathers, which reduc'd into
order, do shew and instruct our present Lawyers which way to decide; nor is the art of the
Physitian any thing more than ancient experience handed down to our times, upon which
the Practiser of our age founds all his method and doctrine. Nevertheless, in the ordering
of Commonwealths, in the conservation of their several members, in the Government of

Kingdoms, in the regiment of armies, in the management of War, in the administration
of Justice, in the enlargement and propagation of Empire, there is not to be found either
Prince, Republick, great Captain or Citizen, which repairs to Antiquity for example; which
persuaded me it proceeded not so much from niceness and effeminacy our present Edu|cation
has introduced upon the world, nor from the mischief which turbulent and sedi|tious
idleness has brought forth in many Provinces and Cities in Christendom, as from our
ignorance or inadvertency in History not taking the sense of what we read, or not minding
the relish and poinancy with which it is many times impregnated; from whence it comes
to pass, that many who read are much pleased and delighted with the variety of accidents
contained in History, but never think them intended for their imitation, that being a thing,
in their judgments, not only difficult, but impossible; as if the Heaven, the Sun, the Ele|ments
and Mankind were altered and dispossessed of the motion, order and power with
which they were primitively invested. Being desirous to reduce such as shall fall into this
error, I have Judged it necessary to write upon all those Books of Titus Livius, (which, by
the malignity of time, have not been intercepted) what I (according to ancient and mo|dern
opinion) shall think useful for their further explanation; to the end, that they which
shall peruse these my discourses, may extract such advantage and document as is necessary
for their proficiency and improvement by History; and though my enterprize appears to
be difficult, yet by the assistance of those who put me upon it, I do not despair but to dis|charge
my self so, as to leave the way much more easie and short to any man that shall de|sire
to come after me.

CHAP. I.
What have been generally the principles of all Cities, and particularly
of Rome
THose who shall read the Original of the City of Rome, by what Legislators advanced
and by what Government ordered, will not wonder it shall remain firm and entire
for so many ages, afterwards so vast an Empire spring out of it as that Common|wealth
arrived to. Being to discourse first of its Original, it is convenient to premise, that all
Cities are built either by natives born in the Country where they were erected, or by stran|gers.
The first happens when, to the Inhabitants dispersed in many and little parties, it
appears their habitation is insecure, not being able apart (by reason of their distance, or
smalness of their numbers) to resist an invasion, (if any Enemy should fall upon them) or
to unite suddenly for their defence, without leaving their Houses and Families exposed,
which by consequence would be certain prey to the enemy. Whereupon, to evade those
dangers, moved either by their own impulse, or the suggestions of some person among
them of more than ordinary authority, they oblige themselves to live together in some
place to be chosen by them for convenience of provision, and easiness of defence. Of this
sort, among many others, Athens and Venice were two: the first that built under the autho|rity
of Theseus, upon occasion of the like distance and dispersion of the natives. The
other (there being many people driven together into certain little Islands in that point of
the Adriatick Sea, to avoid the War which every day, by the access and irruption of new
Armies of Barbarians after the declension of the Roman Empire grew intolerable in Italy)
began by degrees among themselves, without the assistance or encouragement of any Prince,
to treat and submit to such Laws as appeared most likely to preserve them: and it succeeded
to their desire by the long respite and tranquillity their situation afforded them; that Sea
having no passage at that end, and the Barbarians no ships to disturb them; so that the
least beginning imaginable was sufficient to exalt them to their present authority and gran|deur.
The second case, when a City is raised by strangers, it is done by people that are free, or
depending (as Colonies) or else by some Prince or Republick to ease and disburthen
themselves of their exuberance, or to defend some Territory, which being newly acquir'd,
they desire with more safety and less expence to maintain (of which sort several were
by the people of Rome all over their Empire) otherwise they are sometimes erected by
some Prince, not for his residence so much as for his glory and renown (as Alexandria by
Alexander the great). But these Cities not being free in their Original, do seldom arise to
any extraordinary height more than to be reckoned the heads or chief of some Kingdom.
Of this sort was Florence, for (whether built by the Souldiers of Silla, or perchance by the

Inhabitants of the Mountain di Fiesole, who presuming upon, and being encouraged by the
long Peace under the Reign of Augustus, descended from their Mountain to inhabit the
plain upon the River Arms) it was built under the Roman Empire, and could not upon
those principles exalt it self higher than the courtesie of the Prince would permit. The
Founders of Cities are free, when by themselves, or the Command of their Soveraign they
are constrained upon occasion of sickness, famine, or war, to abandon their own, inquest of
new Countries: and these do either possess themselves of such Towns as they find ready
built in their Conquests, (as Moses did), or they build them de novo, as Aeneas. In this
case the power of the builder, and the fortune of the building is conspicuous and honoura|ble,
according as the cause from whence it derives its Original is more or less eminent. His
virtue and prudence is discernible two ways, by the election of the Seat, and institution
of the Laws; and because men build as often by necessity as choice, and the judgment and
wisdom of the builder is greater where there is less room and latitude for his election; it
is worthy our consideration whether it is more advantagious building in barren and un|fruitful
places, to the end that the people being constrained to be industrious, and less ob|noxious
to idleness, might live in more unity, the poverty of the soil giving them less op|portunity
of dissention. Thus it fell out in Raugia and several other Cities built in such
places; and that kind of election would doubtless be most prudent and profitable, if men
could be content to live quietly of what they had, without an ambitious desire of Com|mand.
But there being no security against that, but power, it is necessary to avoid that
sterility, and build in the fruitfullest places can be found, where their numbers encreasing by
the plentifulness of the soil, they may be able not only to defend themselves against an as|sault,
but repel any opposition shall be made to their grandeur; and as to that idleness to
which the richness of the situation disposes, it may be provided against by Laws and con|venient
exercise enjoyn'd, according to the example of several wise men, who having in|habited
Countries, pleasant, fruitful, and apt to produce such lazy people improper for ser|vice,
to prevent the inconvenience which might follow thereupon, enjoyned such a necessity
of exercise to such as were intended for the Wars, that by degrees they became better Soul|diers
than those Countries which were mountainous and barren could any where produce.
Among whom may be reckoned the Kingdom of Egypt, which, notwithstanding that it was
extreamly pleasant and plentiful, by the virtue and efficacy of its Laws produced excellent
men, and perhaps such as, had not their names been extinguished with time, might have de|served
as much honour as Alexander the Great, and many other great Captains, whose me|mories
are so fresh, and so venerable among us. An who-ever would consider the Govern|ment
of the Soldan, the discipline of the Mamalukes, and the rest of their Militia before
they were extirpated by Selimus the Turk, might find their great prudence and caution in
exercising their Souldiers, and preventing that softness and effeminacy to which the felicity
of their soil did so naturally incline them.
For these reasons I conceive best to build in a fruitful place, if the ill consequences of
that fertility be averted by convenient Laws. Alexander the Great being desirous to build
a City to perpetuate his name Dinocrates an Architect came to him, and undertook to build
him one upon the Mountain Athos, and to recommend and inforce his proposal, (besides
the goodness of the soil) he persuaded him it should be made in the shape and figure of a
man (a thing which would be new, wonderful, and sutable to his greatness). But when
Alexander enquired whence it was to be supplyed, the Architect replyed; he had not con|sidered
of that; at which answer Alexander laugh'd very heartily, and leaving him and
his mountain to themselves, he built Alexandria, where people might be tempted to plant
by the richness of the Soil, the nearness of the Sea, and convenience of the River Nile.
Again, if we examine the Original of Rome, and admit Aeneas for the first Founder, it will
fall in the number of those Cities built by foreigners: if Romulus, among such as were
erected by the natives; either way it was originally free, without any dependance. It will
appear likewise (as shall be shewn more particularly hereafter) by what Laws Romulus,
Numa and others fortified and secur'd it; insomuch that neither the fertility of the Soil,
the commodity of the Sea, the frequency of their Victories, nor the largeness of its Em|pire
were able to debauch or corrupt it; but it remained for several ages for piety and vir|tue
more exemplary than any other Commonwealth either since or before it. And because
the great things acted under that Government, and transmitted to us by Titus Livius, were
performed by publick or private Counsel within or without the City, I shall begin with
what occur'd in the Town, and was managed by publick debate, (as judging that most wor|thy
our annotation) super-adding what-ever depended thereupon; and with these discourses
I intend this first Book (or rather Part) shall conclude.



CHAP. II.
The several kinds of Commonwealths and under which kind the
Roman is comprehended.
WAving the discourse of those Cities which in their beginning have been dependant,
I shall speak of such as were originally free, and governed themselves according to
their own fancies, Commonwealths or Principalities, as their own inclinations lead them.
Of these (according to the diversity of their principles) their Laws and Orders were divers.
Some of them at their first foundation received their Laws at one time from a single person,
as the Spartans from Lycurgus. Others received them by chance, at several times, upon variety
of accidents, as Rome; and that Commonwealth is doubtlesly happy, whose good fortune
it is to have a person so wise as to constitute and dispose its Laws in such manner at first,
that it may subsist safely and securely by them, without necessity of new modelling or cor|rection.
Of this sort was Sparta, which for more than 800 years was observed to remain
entire and incorrupt, without any dangerous commotion. On the other side, that City
must needs be in some measure unhappy, which, not having submitted to, or complyed
with the prudence of a single founder, is necessitated of it selt to remodel and reform, Of
these kinds, that is most unhappy whose principles were at first remote and devious from
the right way which might have conducted to perfection; and indeed those Common|wealths
which are in this degree, are almost impossible to be established by any accident
whatsoever. But others (whose Commencements are good, and capable of improvement,
though perhaps not exquisitely perfect) may become perfect afterwards by the concurrence
of accidents, yet not without danger forasmuch as most men are averse, and will not easily
admit of any new Law which introduces new Orders and Customs into a City, without
great appearance of necessity, and that necessity arising necessarily from some danger im|pending,
it many times falls out the Commonwealth perishes before remedy can be ap|plyed.
Of this the Commonwealth of Florence is instance sufficient, which in the com|motion
of Aretz was the IIth. time reformed, and the 12.th time confounded by the se|dition
of Prato.
But being now to discourse of the State of the Roman Commonwealth, and what were
the accidents and orders which advanced it to that perfection, it is convenient to premise
(what has been asserted by several Authors) that there are but three sorts of Governments
Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy, to either of which who-ever intends to erect a Go|vernment,
may apply as he pleases. Other (of no less reputation) are of opinion the forms
of Government are six, of which three are bad, and three good of themselves, but so easily
corrupted, even they become fatal and pernicious. Those which are good are the three
before mentioned, those which are evil are three others depending upon the three former;
and carrying so near a resemblance, they many times interfere, and fall one into the other, as
Monarchy into tyranny, Aristocracy into Oligarchy, and Democracy into Anarchy and Con|fusion:
insomuch, that who-ever forms his Government of one of the three former, forms
it for no long time, because no care nor remedy can prevent, but it will degenerate into its
contrary, by reason of the similitude betwixt virtue and vice: and these changes and va|riations
of Government happened by accident amongst men; for at the beginning of the
World the Inhabitants being few, they lived dispersed after the manner of beasts: after|wards,
as they multiplyed, they began to unite and, for their better defence, to look out for
such as were more strong, robust, and valiant, that they might choose one out of them
to make him their head, and pay him obedience; from hence the first distinction betwixt
honest and dishonest did arise: for observing that if any injur'd his Benefactor, it imme|diately
created an hatred and compassion among the rest, all people abhorring him that
was ungrateful, and commiserating him that was injur'd; lest the same injustice might hap|pen
to themselves, they began to make Laws, and ordain punishments for offenders; and
this was the first appearance of justice in the World; after which, being to make Election
of their Prince, they did not so much respect the ability of his body as the qualifications of
his mind, choosing him that was most prudent and just; but by degrees their Government
coming to be Hereditary, and not by Election, according to their former way, those which
inherited degenerated from their Ancestors, and neglecting all virtuous actions, began to be|lieve
that Princes were exalted for no other end but to discriminate themselvcs from their
subjects by their pomp, luxury, and all other effeminate qualities, by which means they fell
into the hatred of the people, and by consequence became afraid of them, and that fear en|creasing,

they began to meditate revenge, oppressing some, and disobliging others, till in|sensibly
the Government altered, and fell into Tyranny. And these were the first grounds
of ruine, the first occasion of Conjuration and Conspiracy against Princes, not so much in
the pusillanimous and poor, as in those whose generosity, spirit and riches would not suffer
them to submit to so dishonourable administrations. The multitude following the autho|rity
of the Nobles, took up Arms against their Prince, and having conquered and extirpa|ted
that Government, they subjected themselves to the Nobility which had freed them;
and detesting the name of a single person, they took the Government upon themselves, and
at first (reflecting upon the late Tyranny) governed according to new Laws devised by
themselves, postponing particular profit to publick advantage, so that both the one and the
other were preserved and managed with great diligence and exactness. But their autho|rity
afterwards descending upon their Sons, (who being ignorant of the variations of for|tune,
as not having experimented her inconstancy) and not contenting themselves with a
civil equality, but falling into rapine, oppression, ambition, and adulteries, they changed the
Government again, and brought it from an Optimacy to be governed by few, without
any respect or consideration of Justice or Civility; so that in a short time it hapned
to them as to the Tyrant; for the multitude being weary of their Government, were ready
to assist any body that would attempt to remove it, by which means in a short time it was
extinguished.
And forasmuch as the tyranny of their Prince, and the insolence of their Nobles were
fresh in their memory, they resolved to restore neither the one nor the other, but conclude
upon a popular State, which was regulated so as neither Prince nor Noble should have
any authority: and there being no States but are reverenced at first, this Populacy continued
for some time, but not long, (especially after its Founders) for it fell immediately into an
irresistible licentiousness, contemning all authority both publick and private; and every
man living after his own mind, a thousand injuries were daily committed, so that forc'd by
necessity, by the suggestions of some good ma or for avoiding the like enormities, they
returned to their primitive Kingship, and from thence by degrees relapsed again in the
manner, and upon the occasions aforesaid. And this is the Sphear and Circle in which
all Republicks have, and do move; but it seldom or never happens that they return to the
same circumstances of Government again, because it is scarce possible for any of them to be
so long liv'd, as to pass many times thorow the same mutations and remain upon its legs.
It sometimes comes to pass likewise, that in the conflicts and troubles of a State, being de|stitute
both of counsel and force, it becomes a prey to some neighbouring Commonwealth
that is better governed than it: but admitting that could not be, Governments would fall
from one to another, and make an infinite circulation. For these reasons all the foresaid
forms of Government are in my judgment infirm and unstable; the three good ones from
the shortness of man's life and the three bad ones from their proper imperfections. Where|upon,
the wisest Legislators finding this defect, and avoiding every one of those kinds, they
fram'd a Government which should consist of them all, believing it to be more permanent
and stable, because, Prince, Nobles and People living in the same City, and Communicating
in the same Government, they would be all of them in sight of one another, and more ca|pable
of correction. The person which in this kind has merited most praise was Lycurgus,
who ordered his Laws in Sparta in such manner that giving King Nobility and People
each of them their portion, he erected a Government that continued for more than eight
hundred years, to his great honour, and that Cities repose.
To Solon it hapned clear otherwise, (who was the Athenian Legislator) whose aiming
only at a popular Government, was the cause it was so short lived, that before he died he
saw the tyranny of Pisistrates spring out of it; and though forty years after the Tyrant's
Heirs were expelled, and Athens restored to its liberty, yet resuming the old model which
Solon had recommended, it could not continue above an hundred years, notwithstanding
many new laws were super-added to restrain the insolence of the Nobility, and the loose|ness
of the Commons. But there being no mixture and temperament of Principality and
Optimacy with the other, in respect of Sparta, Athens was but of little duration. But to
return to Rome, though it had not a Lycurgus to obstetricate at its birth, and supply it with
such Laws as might preserve its freedom so long.
Nevertheless, the accidents which hapned upon the dissention betwixt the people and the
Senate produced that in some measure which was defective at its foundation; for though
in its beginning its Laws and Orders were imperfect, yet it did not altogether deflect from
the right way which was to conduct it to perfection, Romulus, Numa, and all the rest of its
Kings making many good laws conformable to its freedom. But their ultimate design being
to perpetuate their Monarchy, though that City remained free, there were many things omit|ted

by those Princes which were necessary for its conservation. And though it fell out their
Kings lost their Dominion upon the abovesaid occasions, yet those who expulsed them,
creating two Consuls in their stead, they rather drove the name than the authority of King|ship
out of the City. After which, the Government residing in the Consuls and Senate,
it consisted only of two of the three sorts, Monarchy and Aristocracy: it remained now
to give place only to a popular Government, and the Roman Nobility being grown insolent
upon occasions which shall be mentioned hereafter, the people tumultuated, took up Arms
against them, and prevailed so far, that (lest otherwise they might lose all) it was consented
the people should have their share, and yet the Senate and Consuls on the other hand retain
so much of their former authority as to keep up their degrees as before: and this was the
beginning of the Tribunes of the people, after the creation of which, that State became
better established, every one of the three sorts having a share in the Government, and for|tune
was very favourable, that though it suffered many mutations and passed from a Mo|narchy
to an Aristocracy, and from that to the people by the same gradations, and the same
occasions I have mentioned; nevertheless the power was not taken from their Kings to
transfer it upon the Nobles, nor from the Nobility to give it wholly to the people; but
remaining mixt and compounded of all three, that Republick grew in time to be perfect,
to which perfection the difference and jealousies betwixt the Senate and people contributed
exceedingly, as shall be largely demonstrated in the two following Chapters.


CHAP. III.
Vpon what accidents and tumults in Rome the Tribune of the people was
created, by which the Commonwealth became more perfect.
ACcording to the judgment of all Authors who have written of Civil Government,
and the examples of all History, it is necessary to who-ever would establish a Govern|ment
and perscribe Laws to it, to presuppose all men naturally bad and that they will shew
and exert that natural malignity as often as they have occasion to do it securely, for though
it may possibly lie concealed for some time, it is for some secret reason which want of pre|sident
and experience renders invisible; but time discovers it afterwards, and is therefore
justly called the Father of truth.
After the expulsion of the Tarquins there appeared in Rome a very great union betwixt
the Senate and people; the Senate seemed to have deposited their old arrogance, and
taken up a gentleness and humility that rendred them grateful even to the meanest mecha|nick:
in this manner they curb'd and constrained their evil designs as having no hopes of
success while the Tarquins were living, who were formidable to the Nobility of themselves
and would be much more, if the people by any ill usage should be animated to joyn with
them, and this was the true ground of their hypocrisie. But no sooner were the Tarquins
dead, and the Nobility discharged of their fear, but they began to expectorate, and spit
out the venome had lain so long in their stomachs against the people using them with all ima|ginable
injury and contempt, which carriage of theirs gives good testimony to my asser|tion,
that man is naturally wicked, never does well but upon necessity; and when at any
time it is at his choice, and he may follow his own genius with freedom, all things run im|mediately
into disorder and confusion; and that saying is not without reason, That Reputa|tion
and poverty make men industrious, but it is Laws which make them good: otherwise, if
people did well of themselves, Laws would be useless; but where that is not to be expe|cted,
Laws become necessary. No sooner were the Tarquins removed, and the authority
and terror where-with they kept the Senate in awe, but it was thought fit to find out some
new invention that might restrain the Nobility, and keep them in the same circles of hu|manity
and justice as the Tarquins had done whilst they were alive: at length, after many
squables and contentions betwixt the people and them, all was accommodated by the crea|tion
of a Tribune for the security of the people, which Tribune was to be invested with such
authority and priviledge as might enable him to become afterwards an Arbitor betwixt
them, and a stop for the future to the insolence of the Nobility.



CHAP IV.
The dissentions betwixt the Senate and the people of Rome, were the occasion
that Commonwealth beame so powerful and free.
I Cannot in silence passover the tumults and commotions which hapned in Rome betwixt
the death of the Tarquins, and the creation of those Tribunes. Nor can I forbear say|ing
something against the opinion of many who will needs have Rome to have been a tu|multuous
Republick, so full of mutiny and confusion, that had not its good fortune and va|lour
supplyed for its defects, it would have been inferior to any other Commonwealth
whatsoever. I cannot deny but fortune and valour were the occasions of the Roman Em|pire;
but, in my judgment, they do not consider, that where the Souldier is good, the disci|pline
is good; and where the discipline is good, there is commonly good fortune: but to
return to the other particulars in that City, I say, those who object against the tumults be|twixt
the Nobles and the people, do in my opinion condemn those very things which
were the first occasion of its freedom, regarding the noise and clamours which do usually
follow such commotions, more than the good effects they do commonly produce, not con|sidering
that in all Commonwealths there are two opposite humours, one of the People,
the other of the Nobles; and that all Laws which are made in favour of liberty, proceed
from the differences betwixt them, as may easily be seen in the revolutions of Rome: for
from the time of the Tarquins to the Gracchi, (which was more than three hundred years)
in all the tumults in Rome seldom any body was banished, and seldomer put to death: so
that it is not reasonable to esteem those popular tumults so dangerous and horrible, nor to
pronounce that a seditious and bloody Commonwealth, which in so long time, among all
their heats and animosities sent not above eight or ten persons into banishment, executed
but few, and condemned not many to any pecuniary Mulct. Nor can it be called reasona|bly
disorderly and irregular, which produced so many examples of all sorts of virtue;
for good examples proceed from good Education, and good Education from good Laws,
and good Laws from those tumults, which many people do so inconsiderately condemn, and
who-ever examines their success, will not find they have produced any Laws or Violence to
the prejudice of the Common interest, but rather on the contrary. And if any should ob|ject
their ways were wild and unusual, to heat the people roaring against the Senate, and
the Senate railing against the people. To see them running tumultuously about the streets,
shutting up their shops, and leaving the Town, I answer, that all Cities ought to be allowed
some ways of vent and evacuation for their passions, and especially those who expect as|sistance
from their people in time of exigence and danger; in which number the City of
Rome was one, and had this custom, that when the Commons had a mind to a new Law,
they either committed some of the aforesaid outrages, or else refused to list themselves for
the Wars, so that to appease, it was in some measure necessary to comply with them, and
the desires of a free people are seldom or never destructive or prejudicial to liberty, because
they commonly spring from actual oppression, or an apprehension of it; and if perhaps
that apprehension should be vain, and ill grounded, there is the remedy of Conventions, in
which some honest man or good Orator may remonstrate their mistake: and the people,
though (as Tully says) they may be ignorant, yet they are capable enough of the truth, and
do easily submit to it, when delivered to them by any person they think credible, and to
be belived. So that it is an obligation upon us to judge more moderately of the Roman
Government, and to consider that so many good effects as proceeded from that Republick,
could not have been produced but from sutable causes: and if their tumults were the oc|casion
of the creation of the Tribunes, they were more laudable than otherwise; for be|sides
that they secured a share of the Government to the people, they were constituted
as Guardians and Conservators of the Roman liberty, as shall be shewn in the Chapter
ensuing.



CHAP V.
Where the Guardianship of liberty may be most securely deposited, whether among
the people or Nobility: and which has greater occasion to tumultuate, he that
would acquire more, or he that would defend and keep what he has.
THey who have given us the wisest and most judicious scheme of a Commonwealth,
have laid down the conservation of liberty as a necessary fundamental, and according
as that is more or less secured, the Government is like to be more or less durable. But for|asmuch
as all Commonwealths consist of Nobility and Populacy, the question arises, In
whose hands that liberty is deposited most safely. In old times among the Lacedemonians,
and in our times among the Venetians, it was intrusted with the Nobility; but among the
Romans with the common people; for which reason it is to be examined which of them
made the better elections.
If we look back to their Originals, there are arguments on both sides; but if we regard
only their fate and conclusion, the Nobility must carry it, in respect that the liberty of the
Spartans and Venetians have been much longer lived. But on the other side, (to justifie the
Romans) freedom is (I conceive) most properly committed to their custody who have least
appetite to usurp. And doubtless, if the ends and designs both of the Nobility and Com|mons
be considered, it will be found the Nobility are ambitious of Dominion, while the
Commons have no other thoughts but to defend themselves against it; and, by consequence,
having less hopes to usurp, they have more inclination to live free: so that the conservation
of their liberty being committed to the people, it is but reasonable to believe they will be
more careful to preserve it; and by how much they are less likely to usurp upon it them|selves,
with the more vigilance will they secure it against the incroachments of others. On
the other side, he that defends the Spartan and Venetian constitution, alledges, that by put|ting
that power into the hands of the Nobility, two excellent things are performed. One
is, that thereby they satisfie their ambition who have the greatest interest in the Common|wealth.
The other, that they take from the people all opportunity of exerting their na|tural
turbulency and unquietness, which has not only been the occasion of infinite dissen|tions,
but is apt likewise to enforce the Nobility upon such desperate courses as may in time
produce unremediable effects. Of this, Rome it self is proposed as an example, where the
Tribunes being invested with that authority, it was not sufficient to have one Plebeian
Consul, but the people must have both, and not content with that neither, they would have
the Censor, Praetor, and the other great Magistrates of the City chosen out of the people.
Nor was this enough, but carried on with the same exorbitant fury, they began by degrees
to adore such men as they saw likely to confront and beard the Nobility, which humour
was the rise of Marius his greatness, and his greatness the destruction of Rome. All this
considered, it is no easie matter, upon impartial deliberation on both sides, to pronounce
which of the two is most safely to be trusted with the liberty, because it is no less difficult
to determine which is most pernicious to a Commonwealth, he that (not satisfied with
what he has) is ambitious of more, or he that is content, and would secure what he has
got. He that shall examine it critically, will conclude thus; Either you argue for a Repub|lick,
whose aim is to extend and propagate its Empire, as Rome; Or one whose designs
reach no further than to preserve what they have got. In the first case 'tis necessary in all
things to follow the example of Rome; in the second, Venice and Sparta are rather to be
imitated for the reasons aforesaid, which shall be reinforc'd in the following Chapter. But
to return from whence we have stragled, and discourse of what men are most nocent in a
Commonwealth, they that are impatient to get, or they that are only fearful to lose; I say,
that when Marcus Menenius was made Dictator, and Marcus Fulvius Master of the Horse,
(both of them Plebeians) to inquire into certain Conspiracies that were entred into at
Capua, against the City of Rome, authority was given them at the same time to examine
and take cognisance of such persons as, by bribery, or any other unlawful means, design'd
upon the Consulship, or any other of the great offices in Rome: by which the Nobility be|ing
highly provoked, (as suspecting it to be done in opposition to them) caused it to be
spread abroad, that the Nobility did not by any ambitious or irregular ways affect or de|sign
upon those great places; but the Commons, who not daring to trust their preferment
to their extraction or virtue, took all extraordinary courses to advance themselves to them.
In particular they accused the Dictator, and that with so much vehemence and success, he
was glad to call a Council, and (having complained very much of the calumniations of

the Nobility) to lay down his Dictatorship, and submit himself to the judgment of the
people, by whom the Cause being heard, he was fairly acquitted. There it was disputed
very hard which was most ambitious; He that would get, or He that would preserve; for
a violent appetite either in the one, or the other may be the occasion of great disturbances,
which in my judgment are oftner caused by them that are in possession, because the appre|hension
of losing what they have got, produces the same eagerness and passion, as desire of
acquisition does in the other, forasmuch as they seldom think themselves safe in what they
have, but by new accumulation; besides, the more wealth or Territory they have, the
more power or capacity they have to Usurp as they see occasion: to which may be added
that their incorrigible and ambitious deportments, do provoke and kindle a desire in such as
have not those dignities, to compass them if they can, and that for two reasons, to revenge
themselves upon them, by stripping them of all, and to enrich themselves into the bargain
by the wealth and honour which they see others manage so ill.


CHAP. VI.
Whether in Rome such a form of Government could be established, as should
take away the animosities betwixt the Senate and the People.
WHat the continued jealousies betwixt the Senate and the People did produce, we
have already discoursed; but because the effects of them remained till the time of
the Gracchi, and were the occasion of the destruction of their liberty, it may be demanded
whether Rome might not have attained that height of Authority and Grandeur under ano|ther
form of Government that might have prevented those animosities. To resolve this
Question, it is necessary to look back upon those Republicks whose Fortune it has been to
retain their liberty a long time without those inconveniencies, to examine what was their
form, and whether it was practicable in Rome. As Examples, we may produce Sparta
and Venice, the first Ancient, the latter more modern, both mentioned before Sparta was
governed by a King, and a small Senate; Venice did not divide the Government into
distinct Names; but all who were admitted to the administration were called Gentlemen
under one common appellation; and that, more by accident, than any prudence in the Le|gislator;
for when to those Rocks upon which that City is now seated, many people did
repair for the reasons abovesaid, in process of time their number encreasing so fast, that they
could not live peaceably without Laws, they resolved to put themselves under some form,
and meeting often together to deliberate upon that, when they found they were numerous
enough to subsist by themselves, they made a Law to praeclude all new comers from the
Government: and hinding afterwards their numbers encrease, and that there were multitudes
of Inhabitants incapable of publick administration; in honours to the Governors they called
them Gentlemen of Venice, and the others but Citizens; and this distinction might not
only be instituted, but continued without tumult, because when first introduced, all the
Inhabitants participating of the Government, no body could complain, and they who came
after, finding it firm and established, had no reason, nor opportunity to disturb it; They
had no reason, because no injury was done them; they had no opportunity, because the
Government restrained them, and they were not employed in any thing that might furnish
them with authority; besides those who came after were not in number disproportionable
to the Governors, the latter being equally, if not more numerous than they; for which rea|sons
the Venetians were able not only to erect, but maintain their Government a long time
without any revolution.
Sparta being (as I said before) governed by a King and a small Senate, might likewise
preserve its Model a long time, by reason the Inhabitants were but few, strangers excluded
and the Laws of Lycurgus established with great veneration, so that living by those Laws,
all occasion of tumult was taken away, and they might continue united a long time; for
though the Offices and Commands were conferred upon a few, yet the revenue of the
Country being equally distributed, the people were not Seditious, though they were kept
at a distance; nor did the Nobility provoke them by any insolence or oppression; and this
proceeded from the condition of their Kings, who being environed by the Nobility, had
no safer way to secure their dignity, than by protecting the people from injustice and vio|lence,
by which means the fear, and the desire of Command being taken from the people,
the Emulations betwixt them and the Nobility and the occasion of tumultuating ceased,
so that it was not hard for them to enjoy their tranquillity several Ages; Of the length of

their tranquillity, there were two principal causes; First, The number of the Spartans
being small, there was no necessity that their Governors should be many; and next no
strangers being admitted, they were not liable to be corrupted, nor to encrease to such a
number, as might grow insupportable to those few who were under their Government.
These things being considered, it is plain that the Roman Legislators could not have insti|tuted
a Commonwealth that should be free from Sedition and Mutiny, any other way,
than by imitating the Venetians and Spartans, that is by not employing the people in their
Wars, like the Venetians, nor entertaining Foreiners into their City, as the Spartans.
But the Roman Legislators transgressing in both, the people grew strong, and by consequence
tumultuous; and if any way the Government were to be rendered more quiet, this in con|venience
would follow, it would be rendered also more weak, and all means be taken away
that might conduct it to that height of grandeur and authority, at which afterwards it
arrived; so that those applications which prevented the tumults in Rome, prevented also
its enlargement, and the extent of its Empire, as it happens in most humane affairs, the
removal of one inconvenience is the contracting of another. For if you arm, and adapt
a numerous people for the War, by their means to enlarge your Territory; you put them
into a conditon of being unmanageable afterwards, and not to be kept down to your Disci|pline
and Government; whereas if you keep them disarmed, and their number but few,
though you may make your self Arbitrary, you can never continue it, for your Subjects
will grow so poor spirited and vile, you will become a pre to the first man that invades
you. In all deliberations therefore, the inconveniences are to be considered, and that reso|lution
prefer'd, in which their are fewest; for none can be taken that are absolutely free
The Romans then in imitation of the Spartans, might have set up a King for his life, and
appointed a little Senate; but by so doing, they could never have laid the foundation of so
vast an Empire, for an Elective King, and a small Senate would have contributed but little
to their unity and peace. He then who would set up a new Commonwealth, should con|sider
whether he would have it (like Rome) extend its Dominion and Soveraignty; or
keep it self within its own bounds without any dilatation. In the first case it is necessary
to imitate the Romans, and give way to the tumults and publick dissentions as well as he
can; for without his Citizens be numerous, and well disciplin'd and arm'd, he can never
extend his Dominion; and if he could, it would be impossible to keep it. In the second,
he is to frame to the Model of the Spartans, and Venetians; but because augmentation of
Empire, is commonly the destruction of such Commonwealths, he is by all possible means
to prohibit new acquisitions, because depending upon weak Commonwealths, they are
always destructive and pernicious, as experience has shown in the Examples of Sparta and
Venice. The first having subdued most part of Greece, discovered, upon a slight accident,
the weakness of its foundation, for the Thebans revolting at the instigation of Pelopidas,
gave opportunity to other Cities, and quite ruined the Government. In like manner Ve|nice
having conquer'd the greatest part of Italy, more by their Mony and Artifice, than
Arms, presuming too much upon their force, and coming to a Battel, they were worsted,
and in one day lost all which they had got. I should think therefore a Commonwealth that
would stand a long time, should model it self within according to the Example of Sparta
and like Venice, seat it self in so strong and inexpugnable a place, that it might not appre|hend
any sudden insult; nor make it self so great on the other side as to become formidable
to its Neighbors; For the common Motives that excite people to make War upon a Com|monwealth,
are two; either to conquer it themselves, or to secure themselves against it,
and by the aforesaid expedient, those two ways are totally frustrated; for if it be hard of
access, and well-disposed to defend it self, it will seldom or never happen that any Body
will attempt it. If it keeps within its own bounds, and by experience be found free from
ambition, no body will fear it, nor will any body offend it; and questionless it would be
the more safe, if by the Laws and Constitutions it was forbidden to extend, for I am clearly
of opinion, that keeping things in this balance and Equilibrium, the Government would
be more civil, and the peace of the City more certain. But the affairs of man being muta|ble,
and nothing in them that is durable and firm; there is a necessity that they either
encrease or diminish, and that necessity does many times constrain us, to what in reason we
should rather decline. Whence it happens, That if a Government be erected apt to defend
it self in peace and security without extending its bounds, and necessity enforces it to en|large,
That enlargement takes away its foundation, and ruines it the sooner. So on the
other side, when the Stars are so benign to a Commonwealth, as to place it in peace,
without any occasion of War, that peace begets idlness, and idlness effeminacy or faction,
which two things (and indeed either of them alone) will be sufficient to subvert it. Where|fore,
it being impossible, as I conceive, to keep things in this balance and mediocrity; in

the constitution of all republicks, particular care is to be had to what is most honorable;
and things are to be so ordered, that if necessity should compel them to inlarge, they might
do it in such manner as to be sure to keep it. But to return, a Commonwealth, in my
judgment, is better fram'd to the example of Rome, than either to the Venetian or Spartan,
it being so hard to hit the exact way between the one and the other; and for the emula|tions
betwixt the Nobility and the People they are to be born as inconveniences, but such
as are necessary for a people that would rise to the Grandeur of the Romans; against which
nevertheless (as I have shewn before) the authority of the Tribunes will be some remedy,
if invested with the power of impeaching, which was given to the Tribunes in other
States, as I shall shew in my next Chapter.


CHAP. VII.
How necessary it is for the conservation of a State, that any Citizen be
securely accused.
THere is nothing of more importance to the safety of a State, than that permission be
given to such as are set up for the conservation of its liberty, to accuse such persons to
the People, the Senate, or other Magistrates, as shall any way offend against the Constitutions
thereof; and this practice has two effects very profitable for the Commonwealth: the
first is, the Citizens, for fear of being accused, do not attempt any thing to the prejudice of
the State; and if they do, they are easily and readily suppress'd: the other is, that thereby
a way is opened for the evacuation of such humours as are too frequent among the Citizens
of every great City; which humours, without some legal vent, do usually recur to extra|ordinary
ways that are absolutely pernicious: wherefore there is nothing renders a Com|monwealth
more stable and firm, than the provision of some legal course for the evapora|tion
of those humors which indanger it. This may be demonstrated by several exam|ples,
but especially by that which is mentioned by Titus Livius in his discourse of Coriola|nus.
He tells us, that the Nobility of Rome being exasperated against the people, for that
they thought their authority too much encreased upon the creation of their Tribunes; and
it hapning at that time, that in respect of the great scarcity of provisions, the State had
sent into Sicily for supplies; Coriolanus being a great adversary to the popular Faction, ad|vised
that this was a fair time to chastise the licentiousness of the people, and to take from
them that power which they had assumed to the prejudice of the Nobility, to which purpose
he persuaded the Senate against distributing the corn. This counsel coming to the ears of
the people, they were so highly incensed, that they set upon him tumultuously as he came
out of the Senate, and had certainly killed him, had not the Tribunes interposed, and cited
him to appear before them in order to his defence. By which accident it is plain how
much it is for the interest of a Commonwealth, that a legal way be provided to discharge
the choller of the people, which otherwise will be apt to fly to extraordinary courses, and
without doubt produce more mischievous effects: for if a single Citizen be cut off, (though
possible unjustly) it begets little or no disorder in the Commonwealth, because execution
is done without private force, or foreign assistance, (which are mortal things to a free
State) and what is done by course of Law, and publick authority, is neither destructive
nor dangerous. And as to ancient examples, I think this of Coriolanus sufficient; from
whence every man may gather what mischief would have resulted to the Commonwealth
of Rome, had he been cut in pieces by the fury of the people; it would have created private
disgusts; those disgusts jealousies, those jealousies provision of defence; that combina|tions;
combinations parties; and parties destruction: but by the interposition of pub|lick
authority, all these evils were prevented. We have seen in our time what inconveni|encies
followed in Florence, because the multitude had not a legal way of spending their in|dignations
against one of their Citizens. Francesco Valori was Prince of that City, suspe|cted
by many people, as if he designed to make himself absolute, and by his haughtiness
and pride to exceed those limits which the Laws had prescribed: there being in that Com|monwealth
no way to prevent it, but by setting up a faction in opposition to his, he began
to look out himself, and to make a party that might defend him. The people on the other
side having no legal way to suppress them, betook themselves to their Arms. And whereas,
if any ordinary way had been open to have opposed him, his designs had been obviated by
his single destruction; being forced upon an extraordinary, it was effected not only by his,
bu by the ruine of many other eminent Citizens. To confirm what we have said, another

instance might be produced in the City in the case of Peter Soderini, which happened for want
of a Law whereby they might impeachany Citizen that aspir'd to the Government. There
were eight judges only in that commonwealth, which are not enough to administer
justice against a powerful man: in States that are well constituted, 'tis necessary there be
more; for where they are so few, their dispatch is but small, and they are corrupted with
more ease than where they are many. If therefore there had been any such way allowed,
upon his ill Government, the Citizens would have formally impeached him, without calling
in an Army of Spaniards; and if his Government had been well, they durst not have ac|cused
him, lest he should have accused them again; and by that means that emulation would
have been prevented which was the cause of so much mischief: from whence it may be
concluded, when ever foreign assistance is called in by any party in a City, that it proceeds
from the ill constitution of that Government, and that there is no legal way of purging
those humours which are so natural to men; against all which, no remedy is more properly
applicable, than by authorizing several persons of quality and interest to receive informa|tions:
which practice was so well followed in Rome, that in all dissentions betwixt the Se|nate
and the people, it was never known that either Senate, or people, or any private Citi|zen
what-ever had recourse to foreign assistance; for having justice at home, what need of
fetching it from abroad? To these Examples aforesaid, we may add another out of Titus
Livius, who tells us, that in Clusia the chief City of the Tuscans, Lucamon having vitiated
a Sister of one Aruns, and Aruns being unable to vindicate her, by reason of the power of
the delinquent, he addressed to the French, who at that time had the Government of Lom|bardy,
and possessing them with the profitableness of the Expedition, he prevailed with
them to bring an Army to revege him of that outrage and injury which his Sister
had received: and doubtless he would never have betaken himself to the relief of a
foreigner, could he have hoped for reparation at home. But as liberty of just accusation is
great security to a State, so toleration of calumny is as dangerous on the other side, which
we shall evince in the following Chapter.


CHAP VIII.
Vnjust calumnies are no less pernicious to a Commonwealth, than legal accusa|tions
are profitable and good.
THough the valour of Furius Camillus (after he had raised their Siege, and driven the
French from their Leaguer before Rome) was so universally venerable, that none of
the Romans thought it diminution either to their reputation or dignity to give him prece|dence;
yet Manlius Capitolinus could not brook that so much honour should be given him,
seeing, in his judgment, he had done as much towards the preservation of the City, and
deserved as well, in saving the Capital, as Camillus had done in the other; and in military
experience he thought himself no way inferior: so that full of envy, and unable to bear
the greatness of his Competitor, finding he could make no impression upon the Senators,
he turned himself to the people, and spread abroad several false reports against him.
Among other things, he puts it into their heads, that the Treasure which was arised for
payment of the French had not been given, but was continued in the hands of private Ci|tizens;
which mony, if reassumed, might be applyed to publick use, and either lessen the
duties, or discharge the debts of the people. These pretences had great influence upon
the people, insomuch as they began to talk, to murmur, to meet, to post themselves tumul|tuously
in many places in the City, which being observed, and thought very dangerous by
the Senate, they created a Dictator to take cognisance of the business, and restrain the fury
of Manlius. The dictator cited Manlius, and appointed him a day; Manlius appeared,
and being environed by the people as the Dictator was by the Senate, silence being made,
the Dictator asked Manlius in whose hands that great Treasure he spake of was detained,
for he did assure him the Senators were as desirous to discover it as the people: to which
Manlius made no positive answer, but by way of evasion, replyed it was unnecessary (he
thought) to tell them what they knew already as well as he; upon which insolence, the
Dictator commanded him to prison; from whence it may be observed how detestable such
calumniations ought to be, not only in every free City, but in every civil Society, and with
what care and severity they are to be suppressed; and that is done most commodiously, by
allowing freedom of accusation; for as calumny is pernicious, information is beneficial to
a State.

Accusation and calumny differ in this point, that any man may calumniate another
where and when he pleases, without bringing testimony, or any other circumstance to prove
it: but in case of accusation 'tis quite another thing, a man must bring his proofs, his wit|nesses,
and other circumstances to make good his charge. People are legally accused no
where but before the Senates, the Magistrates, or the People: but they are calumniated
every where, within doors and without, in the streets and the market-place, and there most
where there is least accusation, and the Cities least disposed to receive them. Wherefore
he who would lay the foundation State, ought principally to provide that all persons might
have liberty to inform against any one, without suspicion or fear; which being solemnly
provided, and faithfully observed, his next business is to secure them against scandals, and the
calumniator can have no reason to complain if he be punished, when there are publick places
appointed to receive the accusations of such as are abused; and if in these things particular
care be not taken, great mischiefs will follow; for these kind of aspersions do not correct,
but provoke their fellow Citizens, and those who are accused are not so much apt to fear
the disgrace, as to hate the authors of the reports. In these cases the Romans had very good
Laws, and they stood them in good stead; but we in Florence having neglected them, have
suffered much by it, and he who peruses the History of our City, will see how subject to calum|niations
in all times those Citizens have been, who have employed in its most important
affairs. One is charged with embezling the publick treasure; another for being corrupted, and
betraying some publick enterprize; a third for ambition, and commiting one insolence or
another, from whence feuds and animosities do arise on hands; and from thence divisions;
from divisions parties; and from parties destruction. Whereas, if in Florence authority
had been allowed for the accusation of Citizens, many mischiefs had been prevented, which
followed for want of it; for those Citizens who were accused (whether condemned or ab|solved)
would have not been able to have molested the State; and the impeachments would
have been fewer than the calumniations, because more people would have been calumniated
than accused, in respect that the first was so much the more easie (as is said hefore) than the
other. And these calumnies have advanced some Citizens to great dignity; for having
great adversaries that opposed their designs, they joyned themselves with the people, and
making them their friends, confirm'd the ill opinion which they had of their adversaries
before. Several examples might be produced to this purpose, but I shall only instance in
one.
The Florentine Army was encamped before Lucca under the Command of Giovanni
Guiccardini their Commissary. By his ill fortune or conduct the Town was not taken;
which of the two soever it was, Giovanni was aspersed, as having been brib'd by the Luc|cheses,
which calumny being propagated by his enemies, netled Giovanni, and almost
brought him to despair; and though, in order to his justification, he offered to put himself
into the hands of the Captain, yet all was to no purpose; for in that Commonwealth
there was no body qualified to clear him: from hence arose great contentions betwixt Guic|cardin's
friends, (who were the greatest part of the Grandees in that City) and those who
studied novelty, which contentions, and others of the like nature, encreasing daily upon
their hands, brought that poor Commonwealth into a most deplorable condition. Manlius
therefore spreading these false reports of the Senators about Rome, was a calumniator, not
an accuser; and the Romans in his case gave manifest instruction how such people are to be
punished, that is, that they be obliged publickly to accuse, and when their charge is made
good, that they be rewarded or encouraged; but when it cannot be proved, that they be
punished like Manlius.


CHAP. IX.
How much a single person is necessary for the establishment of a new common|wealth,
or the reformation of an old.
IT may seem to some, that I have run too far into the Roman History, having made no
mention of the Founders of that Commonwealth, nor of the Orders which they ob|served
either in matters of Religion, or War. To ease them therefore of their suspence,
who are desirous to hear something to that purpose, I say, that many perhaps may think it
of ill example for the Founder of a State, as Romulus was, to kill his own Brother, and af|terwards
consent to the death of Titus Tatius Sabinus, who was chosen his companion in
the Government, supposing that according to that president, any of his Citizens that were

ambitious of Command, might make away their adversaries or competitors, and remove
any obstucle that opposed them; and it were reasonable enough, were it not to be considered
to what end, and upon what motives that murder was committed.
This is to be taken for a maxim, and general rule, that it is impossible for any Govern|ment
either to be well founded at first, or will reformed afterwards, unless by a single per|son,
by whose direction all Orders, all Laws are to be made and promulged. He therefore
who is the founder of a Common-wealth, if he be an honest man, and aims not at his
own interest, and the raising of his Family, more than the advancement of his Country,
must endeavour to get the power into his single hands, nor will any wise man ever accuse
him for any action extraordinary that he shall do in order thereunto; or if the fact be to be
blamed, the effect will excuse it, especially if be good, as it was in Romulus his case, for it
is destructive and pernicious violence that is to be reprehended, not that which tends to set|tlement
and reformation. He is also to be so prudent and vertuous, as not to leave the
authority which he assumed in inheritance to another, because men being more prone to
evil than good, his success or may employ that power to the prejudice of the State, which he
in his wisdom made use of to its benefit and advantage.
Moreover, though one be fittest to make Laws, yet when once made, they cannot hold
long, if left upon the shoulders of a single person, but when the care and execution of them
is transfer'd upon many, and many are concerned to maintain them, it is much better; for
though many be not so proper in laying the foundations of a Government, because
their diversity of opinions keeps them from discerning what is absolutely for its good; yet
when things are once setled, and they have found it, that very diversity will be a means to
preserve it. And that Romulus was excusable for what he did to his Brother and Com|panion,
and that what he did was more for the common good than his own private ambi|tion
or revenge, appears by this; that he had no sooner made them away but, he constitu|ted
a Senate, by whose advice he acted in every thing, reserving to himself only the power
of calling them together, and commanding the Armies when they should resolve of a War:
and of this we cannot have better evidence than that which followed after the expulsion of
the Tarquins, there being nothing innovated or altered by the Romans, only in stead of one
perpetual King, they created two annual Consuls; which shews that Romulus in his first
Institutions aimed rather at the election of a civil and a free, than an absolute and tyrannical
State. Many more examples might be produced to fortifie what is said, as those of Moses,
Lycurgus, Solon, and other Founders of Kingdoms and Commonwealths, who, by assuming
a Monarchical authority, were able to frame and impose such Laws as were for the bene|fit
of the publick; but being so well known, it would be superfluous. I shall add only
one, not so famous perhaps, yet worthy to be considered by those who are desirous to be
good Legislators; and it is this, Agls King of Sparta observing his Citizens had lost much
of their ancient virtue, and by consequence were decayed both in their power and Empire,
imputing it in part to their deviation from the Laws of Lycurgus, desired very earnestly to
reduce them again, but before he could bring it to perfection he was slain by the Spartan
Ephori, as one who designed to make himself absolute; but Cleomenes succeeding him
in the Government, having the same inclination, and perceiving by some Records and
Writings which Agis had left behind, what was his intention, he found that he could
not do his Country that service any way, but by making himself absolute: for by the
ambition of some persons, he found that he could not do the good which he designed to
the generality, by reason of the malevolence of a few, wherefore he caused the Ephori,
and who-ever else he thought likely to obstruct him, to be killed, and revived the Laws of
Lycurgus, which noble act might have recovered that State, and have made Cleomenes as
venerable as Lycurgus himself, had it not been for the power of Macedon, and the weakness
of other Commonwealths; for not long after that reformation, being invaded by the
Macedonians, it proved unable to defend it self, and having no body to sustain it, was over|come;
and that just and honourable design was unhappily laid aside. Considering therefore
what has been said, I conclude, that a single person is best for the institution or regulating of
any sort of Government, and that for the death of Remus and Tatius, Romulus was not to
be blamed.



CHAP. X.
As they are to be praised who lay the foundations of any Republick or
Kingdom, so they are to be condemn'd who set up a Tyranny.
AMong all Excellent and Illustrious men, they are most praise worthy who have been
the chief establishers of Religion and Divine Worship: In the second place are they
who have laid the foundations of any Kingdom or Commonwealth; In the third, those
who having the Command of great Armies have enlarged their own, or the Dominion of
their Country; In the next, Learned Men of all Sciences according to their several studies
and degrees; and last of all (as being infinitely the greatest number) come the Artificers
and Mechanicks; all to be commended as they are ingenious or skilful in their Professions.
On the other side, they are infamous and detestable, who are contemners of Religion, sub|verters
of Governments, Enemies of Virtue, of Learning, of Art, and in short of every
thing that is useful and honourable to mankind; and of this sort, are the prophane, the se|ditious,
the ignorant, the idle, the debauched, and the vile. And although Nature has so
ordered it, that their is neither wise man nor fool, nor good man, nor bad, who if it
were proposed to him which he would choose of these two sorts of people, would not pre|fer
that which was to be preferred, and condemn the other; yet the generality of Mankind
deluded by a false impression of good, and a vain notion of glory, leaving those ways
which are excellent and commendable, either wilfully or ignorantly wander into those
paths which will lead them to dishonour; and whereas to their immortal honour they
might establish a Commonwealth or Kingdom as they please, they run head-long into a
Tyranny, not considering what fame, what glory, what affection, what security, what
quiet and satisfaction of mind they part with, nor what reproach, scandal, hatred, danger
and disquiet they incur. It is impossible but all people, (whether of private condition in
the Commonwealth, or such as by their Fortune or Virtue have arrived to be Princes)
if they have any knowledge in History, and the passages of old, would rather choose (if
private persons) to be Scipio's than Caesar's; and (if Princes) to be Agesilaus, Timolion
and Dion, than Nabis, Phalaris, or Dionysius; because they must find the one highly cele|brated
and admired, and the other as much abhor'd and condemn'd; they must find Ti|moleon,
and the rest to have as much interest and authority in their Countries, as Dionysius
or Phalaris had in theirs, and much more security. Nor let any man deceive himself with
Caesar's reputation, finding him so exceedingly eminent in History, for those who have
cryed him up, were either corrupted by his fortune, or terrified by his power, for whil'st
the Empire continued, it was never permitted that any man should speak any thing against
him, and doubtless had Writers had their liberty, they could have said as much of him as
of Cataline, and Caesar is so much the worst of the two, by how much it is worse to effect
and perpetrate an ill thing, than to designe it; and this they might judge by what is said of
his adversary Brutus, for not daring to speak downright of Caesar, by reason of his power,
by kind of reverse, they magnified his Enemy: After Rome also was grown to be an
Empire, and the Government in the hands of a single person, it may be observed how
much more happy and secure those Emperors were who lived like good Princes, according
to the dictate of the Laws, than those who lived otherwise; for Titus, Nerva, Trajanus,
Adrianus, Antoninus, and Marcus, had no need of Praetorian bands, nor multitude of
Legions to defend them, their own excellent deportment, the benevolence of the people,
and the affection of the Senate, saved them that charge: It will appear likewise how to
Caligula, Nero, Vitellius, and several other Tyrannical Emperors; their Eastern and
Western Armies were not sufficient to secure them against the Enemies, which their irre|gularity
and ill manners had contracted; The History of which persons, if well considered,
would enable any Prince to distinguish betwixt the ways of Honour and Infamy, of Security
and Fear: For of XXVI Emperors betwixt Caesar and Maximinus, XVI were murdered,
and but X died in their beds; and though some of those who were slain might possibly
be good, (as Pertinax, and Galba) yet they were murdered by reason of the corruption
and ill discipline which their Predecessors had left in the Army; and if among those who
died naturally, there were any Tyrannical, (as Severus) it is to be imputed to his great
Courage and Fortune, which are two things very seldom Concomitant in one man, it is
legible likewise in the same History upon what Basis and foundation a Monarchy must be
built, to make it solid, and permanent; for all those Emperors who succeeded by here|ditary
right were ill men, except Titus only, and those who came in by Election were

good, as Nerva and the four which succeeded him; but when the Empire became wholly
Hereditary, it ran furiously to destruction. Let the times therefore from Nerva to Marcus
be displayed before your Prince, and let him compare them which went before with those
which came after, and then make his choice when they would have been born, or when he
would have been Soveraign; He will find when good men were at the Helm, the Prince
safe in the security of his Subjects; Peace and Justice flourishing in the world; The Senate
in Authority; The Magistrates in Esteem; Rich men enjoying their Estates; Nobility and
Virtue Exalted; and all things quiet and well; No rancour; No licentiousness; No cor|ruption;
No ambition to be found; the times were golden; Every man enjoyed his
opinion, and defended it as he pleased; In a word, He will find the world triumphing in
felicity, The Prince happy in the reverence and affection of the people; and the people
safe in the generosity of their Prince. If then the Reigns of the other Emperors be con|templated,
they will appear full of commotion, discord, and sedition, assassinations in Peace;
Cruelty in War; Many Princes murther'd; many Foreign, many domestick embroilments;
All Italy afflicted; and all its Cities destroyed; Rome burnt; The Capitol by its own Inhabi|tants
demolished; The ancient Temples desolate; Religious Ceremonies prophaned; and
the whole Citie full of Adulteries; The Sea covered with Exiles, and the Rocks with blood;
Infinite Cruelties and Barbariss committed daily in the City; And Nobility, Riches,
Honour, and especially Virtue, grown to be Capital offences. Informers and Calumnia|tors
will be found to be rewarded; Servants instigated against their Masters; Children
against their Parents; and those few who were so unhappy as to have no Enemies; to be
destroyed by their Friends; Then it will appear what mighty obligations Rome, and Italy,
and the whole world had to Caesar; and doubtless if the Prince be endued with the lest spark
of humanity or good nature, he will detest the imitation of the bad, and be inflamed with
an ardent propensity to the good. All which things considered, that Prince certainly
which aims at glory, and reputation in the world should desire a Government, where the
manners of his Subjects are corrupted and depraved, not to subvert and destroy it like
Caesar, but to rectifie and restore it like Romulus, than which the Heavens, cannot confer,
nor man propose to himself greater honour. And if a Prince who would regulate and re|form
a City, cannot do it, without depositing his Authority; In that case he is excu|sable
in some measure, if he dispenses; but where he can retain the one, and accomplish
the other, he is altogether unpardonable; they therefore to whom the Heavens are so
propitious as to present such an opportunity, are to consider that they have two ways
before them, one leading to security whil'st they live, and an honourable memory
when they are dead, the other to continual troubles here, and perpetual infamy here|after.


CHAP. XI.
Of the Religion and Ceremonies of the Romans.
THough Rome should have been founded by Romulus, and owe him (as his Daughter)
for her Birth, and Education; yet the Heavens foreseeing that the Constitutions of
Romulus would not be sufficient for so great an Empire, put it into the heart of the Roman
Senate, to create Numa Pompilius for his Successor, to the end that what was left defective
by the first, might be compleated by the latter. Numa finding the people martial and
fierce, and being desirous by the Arts of Peace to reduce them to civil obedience, he betook
himself to Religion, as a thing absolutely necessary to the maintenance of civil policy; and
he ordered things, so that for many ages together never was the fear of God so eminently
conspicuous as in that Commonwealth, which was a great promotion to whatever was
designed either by the Senate or Princes. And he who shall peruse the infinite actions of
that City collectively, or of several Romans in particular will find those Citizens more
tender of falsifying an Oath, than of violating the Laws, judging an offence against God
more hainous, than an offence against Men, and God more able to punish it: Of this we
have manifest Evidence in the Examples of Scipio, and Manlius Torquatus, for after the
defeat which Hanibal had given the Romans at Cannas, the people tumultuating, and many
of them assembling in great fear to consider of their condition; They resolved among them|selves
to leave Italy, and transplant into Sicily. Scipio having notice, repaired to them
immediately, and coming in suddenly among them with his Sword drawn, he forced them to

recant, and take a peremptory Oath not to abandon their Country. Lucius Manlius Fa|ther
to Titus Manlius (who was afterwards called Torquatus) was impeached by Marcus
Pomponius a Tribune of the people. Before the day arrived for the hearing of the Father,
the Son coming to the Tribune and threatning to kill him, unless he would swear to with|draw
his accusation, he forced him to his Oath, and he performed as he had sworn; and
so those Citizens who could not be retained by either the love of their Country, or Laws;
were kept at home by an Oath which they took upon force: and the Tribune laid by his
hatred to the Father, passed by the insolence of the Son, and neglected the reflection it
would have upon his own honour, to be punctual in his Oath; which proceeded from no|thing
but those principles of Religion which Nama had distused. And surely it will be
found by whoever considers the Roman History, how useful a thing Religion was to the
governing of Armies, to the uniting of the people, to the keeping men good, and to the
deterring them from being bad; so that should it fall into dispute whether Rome was most
obliged to Romulus or Numa, I am of opinion, Numa would have the preheminence, be|cause
where Religion is fixed Military Discipline is easily introduced; but where Religion
is wanting, Discipline may be brought in with difficulty, but never in perfection. It is
to be seen likewise that for the constituting a Senate, and establishing of Laws both Mili|tary
and Civil, Romulus had no need to pretend Divine Authority; but with Numa it was
otherwise, he was of necessity to pretend to it, and thereupon gave out that he had private
Conference with a Nymph, who dictated to him what he was to prescribe to the people,
and all was, because he had a mind to introduce new Laws and Customs into that City,
which he thought his own private authority would never effect. And certainly never any
man brought in new Laws, or set up any Doctrine extraordinary, but with pretence of
Religion; because otherwise they would never have been admitted; for a man may be wise
and know many things are good, and yet want reasons and arguments to convince other
people; wherefore to remove that difficulty, prudent men do make that always their pre|tence,
and Solon, Lycurgus, and several others who had the same design, practised the
same. The people (then) admiring the goodness and wisdom of Numa, submitted in all
things; True it is the devotion of the age, and ignorance of the people contributed much,
for thereby he was able to impress them with what new form he thought good; and
questionless, he that would establish a Commonwealth at this day, would find it more easie
among the rude people of the Mountains who have not been acquainted with Civility,
than among such as have been educated in Cities, where their civility was corrupted; like
rude unpolished Marble which is more readily carv'd into a Statue, than what has been
mangled already by some bungling workman. So that all things considered, I conclude,
That the Religion introduced by Numa, was one of the first causes of that Cities felicity,
because Religion produced good Laws, good Laws good Fortune, and good Fortune a
good End in whatever they undertook. And as strictness in Divine Worship, and Con|science
of Oaths, are great helps to the advancement of a State so contempt of the one, and
neglect of the other are great means of its destruction. Take away Religion, and take
away the foundation of Government; for though perhaps the goodness and fear of their
Prince may sustain it for some time, and supply the want of Religion in his subjects; yet
because he is mortal, and possibly but very short lived, that Kingdom can hardly out-live
the virtue of its Governor: Wherefore those States which depend only upon the piety of
their Princes, are of little duration, for commonly one dyes with the other, and the virtue of
the Father seldom revives in the Son, as Dante has said very wisely,
Rade volte discende per li rami
L' tunn ana probitate, et questo vuole
Quel che la da, perche da lai si chiami.
Virtue's but seldom to the branches spread,
He who bestows't, has in his wisdom said,
Let him that wants, come to the fountain-head.
Things being thus, it is not sufficient for a Commonweal thor Kingdom to have a Prince
who Governs it wisely whil'st he lives, but he must lay his foundation so, as it may out|live
him, and flourish when he is in his grave; and though rude, and uncultivated people
are more susceptible of new Laws, or new Doctrines; yet men that are civil, and presume
more upon their Education are not altogether impenatrable. The people of Florence thought
themselves no fools, and they had a good opinion of their breeding; nevertheless they
suffered themselves to be deluded by Frier Girolamo Savonarola into persuasion that he

had Conference with God. A person of his gravity is not to be mentioned but with reve|rence,
and therefore whether true, or not true, I will not determine, only this I shall say,
many believed him, who never saw any thing extraordinary to induce them; his Life, his
Doctrine, the subject of his discoursing being in their thoughts enough to convince them.
Let no man therefore despair of what another man has attained, for men (as I said in my
Preface) are born, live, and dye, in the same method as formerly.


CHAP. XII.
How necessary for the preservation of a State it is, that Religion be in esteem,
and how much Italy has suffered for want of it, by means of the Church
of Rome.
THose Princes and Commonwealths who would keep their Governments entire and
incorrupt, are above all things to have a care of Religion and its Ceremonies, and
preserve them in due veneration, for in the whole world there is not a greater sign of immi|nent
ruine, than when God and his Worship are despised. This is easily understood by
observing upon what foundation the Religion is placed where every man is born. The
Religion of the Gentiles ran much upon the answers of Oracles, upon Divinations, and
Soothsaying, upon which all the rest of their Sacrifices, Rights, and Ceremonies did de|pend;
for they did not doubt but the same thing that could presage your fortune (be it
good, or be it bad) could as easily confer it; and therefore they built their Temples, they
made their Sacrifices, they offered up their prayers, and used all other Ceremonies that
might signifie their veneration; for the Oracles of Delos, he Temple of Iupiter Ammon,
and such other things had a strange influence upon people, and kept them in most wonder|full
devotion; but afterwards when they began to speak according to the interest or dire|ctions
of great persons, and their partiality began to be discovered; the people grew incre|dulous,
and prone to all kind of disturbance: A Prince therefore or Commonwealth
ought most accurately to regard, that his Religion be well founded, and then his Govern|ment
will last, for there is no surer way than to keep that good and united. Whatever
therefore occurs that may any way be extended to the advantage and reputation of the
Religion which they design to establish (how uncertain or frivolous soever it may seem to
themselves) yet by all means they are to be propagated and encouraged, and the wiser
the Prince, the more sure it is to be done; This course having been observed by wise men,
has produced the opinion of Miracles, which are celebrated even in those Religions which
are false; for let their Original be as idle as they please, a wise Prince will be sure to set
them forward, and the Princes authority recommends them to every body else. Of these
miracles, there were many in Rome, as at the sacking of Urii, some of the Roman Soldiers
entring into the Temple of Iuno, accosting her Image, and asking it Vis venire Roman,
will you come to Rome; To some of them she seemed to beckon by way of consent, and,
others fancied she said Yes; For those men being more than ordinary religious (as Titus
Livius infers from the devotion, and reverence, and quietness wherewith they entred)
they fancied they heard that answer, which 'tis possible they expected before; and Camillus
and the other Magistrates of the City promoted their belief: And if this diligent care in
Divine Worship were regarded by Christian Princes according to the Precepts and Instru|ctions
of him that gave it at first, the States and Commonwealths of Christendom would
be much more happy and firm: Nor can any thing portend the ruine of our Church with
more certainty, than that those who are nearest the Church of Rome, (which is the head of
our Religion) should have less Religion than other people: and he who should consider
the present practice, with the primitive foundation, would find that either utter destru|ction,
or some great judgment was hanging over our heads. And for as much as some are
of opinion, that the felicity and welfare of Italy depends upon the Church of Rome, I shall
set down some few reasons to the contrary, which I have fram'd to my self, two of which
are in my judgment unanswerable: One is that by the corrupt example of that Court, that
Province has lost all its Religion, and all its Devotion, which has been followed by many
inconveniences, and disorders; for as the Religiousness of the people presuppose all well,
so where they are wicked, it betokens the contrary; so then, we Italians have this Obli|gation
to the Church and its Ministers, that by their means we are become Heathenish and
Irreligious; besides another (little less pernicious) and that is, that we are grown divided
and factious, which must of necessity be our ruine, because never was any Province happy

or united, unless under the obedience of one Commonwealth, or one Prince, as France
and Spain at this time: and the reason is, because Italy is not upon the same terms, as
having no one Republick or Commonwealth to govern it, but the Church, and though
the Pope has assumed a Temporal as well as Spiritual jurisdiction, yet he was never so
couragious or powerful as to possess himself of all, and make himself Prince; nor was he
ever so weak, but upon any apprehension of losing his Temporal Dominion, he could call
in some Foreign Potentate to defend him against any man who was grown too formidable;
and this has been seen anciently in many Examples, as when by assistance of Charles the
Great, he repelled the Lombards who in a manner hacd made themselves Masters of all Italy;
and when again in our days he retrenched the power of the Venetians by the help of the
French, after which he drove out the French by the succour of the Swizzers. The Church
therefore being neither so strong as to conquer all Italy, nor so weak as to suffer it to be
over-run by any body else, has been the occasion that it never fell into the hands of one
person, but has been cantonized into several Principalities, by which means it has been so
weak and disunited, that it has been not only exposed as a prey to the power of the
Barbarians, but to every one that thought good to invade it which is an unhappiness we
Italians owe only to the Church: If any man suspects what is said, and would be expe|rience
inform himself of the truth, it would be necessary he should be so potent as to trans|plant
the Court of Rome and all its Authority in Italy into the Territories of the Swizzers,
who are the only people at this day which live either as to their Ecclesiastical or Military,
Discipline, according to the Model of the Ancients, and then he would quickly find that
the wickedness and depravity of that Court, would produce more confusion and disorder in
that Country than ever befell it by any accident before.


CHAP. XXIII.
How the Romans pretended Religion many times to regulate their City,
to prosecute their Wars, and to pacifie their tumults.
ANd I hold it not extravagant to produce two or three Examples in which the Romans
made use of their Religion both in the regulation of their City, and the prosecution of
their Wars; and although in Titus Livius they be very frequent, yet I shall content my self
with these.
After the people of Rome, had created their Tribunes with consular power and all of
them (except one) from among the Plebeans; there hapning that year, a furious Plague,
a desperate Famine, and other Prodigies besides, the Nobility in the next creation of Tri|bunes
took advantage of that occasion, and pretended that the Gods were incensed against
the people, for that they had debased the Majesty of the Empire, and that there was no
remedy to appease them but to reduce the Election of the Tribunes to its primitive insti|tution;
upon which the people were so frighted, they chose all their Tribunes that year,
out of the Patricii. It was the same case in the taking of Veii The Romans had been
before it ten years, and no great lekelihood of carrying it; but the Tenth, the Lake of
Albin being miraculously swell'd; so as to drown a good part of the Country, the great
Officers of the Army observing their Soldiers weary of the Siege, and impatient to be at
home; feigning to have consulted the Oracles, they pretended that they had received this
answer, That Veii should be taken that year that Albin overflowed; which answer
reflecting upon their Devotion, the Soldiers reassumed their Courage, continued
the Siege, and (Camillus being chosen Dictator) carried the Town; and thus you may
see how the Romans made use of their Religion to encourage their Army against the fatigues
and dangers of a tedious Leaguer, and to fright the people from entrenching upon the pri|viledges
of the Nobility in the Election of their Tribunes; without which pretence it
would have been a hard matter to have persuaded either the one or the other. There was
another example to the same purpose, Terentillus, a Tribune of the people, would needs make
a Law (which was called Lex Terentilla, and shall be mentioned hereafter) contrary to the
interest, and inclination of the Senate. The Senate resolved to oppose it, and the best
means they could think of, was pretence of Religion; of which they made use two ways;
they ordered the Books of the Sybils to be look'd over, and this answer to be returned,
That that very year the City would be in great danger of losing its liberty, unless civil Sedi|tion
was prevented; which artifice, (notwithstanding it was discovered by the Tribunes)
put the people into such a fright, they grew cool in the business, and refused to stand by
them. After this, they made use of the same pretence another time; Appius Herdonius

having got together of Slaves and Exiles to the number of Four thousand men, seized upon
the Capitol in the night, and brought such a terror upon the City, it might very well be
feared if the Aequi and the Volsci (perpetual Enemies to the Romans) had taken their op|portunity
and marched to Rome, they would have gone near to have master'd it: However
the Tribunes persisted, and nothing could serve their turns, but the Lex Terentilla must be
promulged; for they affirmed the Stories of being invaded, were but suggestions and fal|lacies,
and not one word of them true: Hereupon one Publius Rubetius (a grave Citizen,
and of good authority among them) came forth of the Senate, and partly by fair words and
partly by foul, remonstrating the danger of the City, and the unseasonableness of their de|mands,
he play'd his part so well, that the Constrained the people to take an Oath of fidelity
o the Consul; and in testimony of their integrity, the people ran to their Arms, and reco|vered
the Capital from Herdonius; but Publius Valerius their Consul being slain in the
Conflict, Titus Quintius was chosen immediately in his place; who to keep the populace
employed, and leave them no time to think of their Law Terentilla, Commanded them out
of Town forthwith against the Volsci, alledging that the Oath which they had taken to be
true to the Consul, obliged them to follow him; and though the Tribunes opposed it, and
objected that that Oath extended no further than to the Consul that was dead; nevertheless
Livy tell us, that such was the peoples tenderness and veneration for Religion, that they
chose rather to follow the Consul, than to strain and presume upon their Consciences, giving
this reason for it.
Nondum haec, quae nunc tenet seculum, negligentia dem venerat, nec, interpretando sibi
quisque jusjurandum,  leges aptas faciebat.
The neglect of the Gods, which has overspread this Age, was not then come to that height, nor
did everyman interpret his Oaths, and accommodate his Laws, to his own interest and advantage.
Upon which the Tribunes perceiving their danger and that if they persist, they should
run a hazard of being utterly extinguished; they came to an agreement with the Consul,
received his Orders, obliged themselves not to insist upon the Lex Terentilla for a Twelve-month,
in case the Consuls for the same time would forbear drawing out the people. And
thus you see how by pretence of Religion, the Senate overcame a difficulty, which without
it, it could never have done.


CHAP. XIV.
The Romans were wont to interpret their Auspices with accommodation to their
own pleasures and designs; and when at any time they were forced to transgress
they managed it wisely, and pretended to be very precise; and if any body
rashly despised them, he was sure to be punished.
AMong the Gentiles, Auguries were a great part of their Religion (as I have said else|where)
and they contributed not a little to the well being of the Roman Common|wealth;
for which reason the Romans had them in particular care, above any other Ordi|nance,
and made use of them in the creation of Consuls, in the undertaking of Enterprizes,
in drawing out their Armies, in their Battels and Engagements, and in every other business
of importance, whether Military or Civil; nor would they ever begin an Expedition, till
they had possessed the Soldiers that the Gods had promised them success; Among the several
Orders of Auspices, they had one called the Pullarii, who were to give their presages before
ever they fought with their Enemy: If the pullen, over which they had inspection, Eat, it
was a good Omen, and they might with confidence engage; if they did not Eat, It was an
ill sign, and they were obliged to forbear: Nevertheless, when reason told them their Enter|prizes
were practicable, they went roundly about them, though perhaps their Auspices were
averse, but acted with great nicety and cunning, that it might not seem done in defiance of
Religion: This was practised by Papirius the Consul before his Battel with the Samnites
after which they never recovered. For being drawn up with his Army against the Samnites,
with all visible advantage, and being willing to fall on, he commanded the Pullarii to try
their Experiment; the Chickens refusing to peck, was a great trouble to the chief of the
Pullarii, who observed the great alacrity of the Soldiers, and the great confidence of the Ge|neral;
that an occasion therefore of so signal a Victory might not be taken from the Army,
he return'd answer to the Consul that the Omen was good; Papirius put his Men immedi|ately
into Battalia, and advanced against the Enemy; but some of the Pullarii having told
it up and down among the Soldiers, that the Pullets did not eat, it came to the ears of Spurius

Papirius, Nephew to the Consul, who in great hast advertising his Unckle, received this
answer, Spurius be you diligent, and observe your Orders; to my self and my Army the Auspi|cia
are good; if the Pullarius has told me false, the misfortune will be to him; and that the
event night correspond to his Prognostick, he commanded the Pullarii to be placed in the
front of the Battel; His Commands being executed, it hapned by accident as they were
advancing to the fight, the chief of the Pullaru was killed by a dart from one of the Roman
Soldiers, which being told to the Consul, Now (said he) all will be well, the Gods are ap|peased,
and the blood of the Author has atton'd for his lye; and so by a discreet accommoda|tion
of his designs to the Auspices, he went on to the Combat, his Army taking no notice
that he had violated their Religion. Had Appius Pulcher been so ingenious in Sicily in the
first Punick War, it had fared better with him when he came home, but being to fight the
Carthaginian Army, he consulted the Pullarii, who informing him that the Pullen would
not eat, We will see then (said he) if they will drink, and caused them to be thrown into
the Sea: and coming afterwards to an Engagement, his Army was defeated, himself con|demn'd
at his return, and Papirius advanced, not so much because one had prevailed, and the
the other was beaten, as because one had prudently evaded the Omen, and the other rashly
defyed it: and these Auguries were invented for no other end, but that the Soldiers might
go to the fight with more confidence and alacrity; for their alacrity was observed to contri|bute
much to their success; and this practice was so fortunate to the Romans, that foreign
Governments began to make use of it; as I shall show by one Example in the following
Chapter.


CHAP. XV.
How the Samnites in the extremity of their affairs, as their last
refuge, had recourse to Religion.
THe Samnites had long War with the Romans, fought several Battels with them, and
in the last fight in Tuscany, were so utterly broken, that their Army was destroyed,
their chief Officers slain, and the Tuscans, Gauls, and Umbri, (their allies) uncapable of
giving them any further assistance; so that Livy tells us, Nec suis, nec externis viribus jam
stare poterant, tamen bello non abstinebant, adeo ne infeliciter quidem defensae libertatis taoedebat
 vinci, quam non tent are victoriam Malebant. That though they were reduced to such a
condition, That they could neither support themselves by their own strength, nor the supplies of
their Friends, yet they continued the War; so that the unhappiness of their defence could
not discourage them, but they chose rather to be conquered, than not to try for the Victory.
Hereupon knowing that no Victory is to be expected, where the Soldier is diffident; and
that nothing enhanses them like a Religious opinion; as their last effort, they concluded
(by the Ministery of Ovius Paccius their Priest) to revive an old Ceremony, which they did
in this manner; Altars being erected, and solemn Sacrifice made, betwixt the flaming
Altar, and the bones of the Victims, the Officers having first sworn never upon any distress
whatsoever to abandon the fight; the Soldiers were called over one by one, and in the same
place (before several Centurions with their naked Swords in their hands appointed to that
purpose) required to swear, first, that they would not deride any thing that they should
either hear or see; after which, with execrable words, and Verses full of horror, they
caused them to take their Oaths to be ready at the Command of their Generals, never to
fly, and to kill any of their fellows that offer'd to turn his back: and if ever they broke
them, they imprecated a judgment upon themselves, and their race. Some of them being
scrupulous, and unwilling to swear, were killed upon the place, which struck such terror
into the rest, that none of them refused. And that this Ceremony might be performed
with more magnificence, there being 40000 Men in the field, half of them were clothed
in white, with Plumes of feathers upon their Helmets, in which posture they encamped
not far from Aquilonia; Papirius was sent against them, and in his Speech to his Soldiers,
he had this Expression, Non enim Crist as vulnera facere,  picta, at aurata scuta, transire
Romanum pilum. For their feathers made no wounds, nor could the paint or glittering of
their Shields protect them against the darts of the Romans. And to take off the opinion from
his Soldiers, that the solemnity and Nature of their Oath, might make the Enemy despe|rate;
he told them, That that would be rather a terror, than an encouragement to them
when they came to consider that by their own folly they had brought themselves in danger
of the Gods, the Romans, and their Comerades. In short the Samnites wear beaten, the

Roman virtue, and the memory of their own frequent misfortunes prevailing against all the
forc'd courage which either their Oath or their Religion could give them. Nevertheless
their sence of it was visible, seeing they made use of it as their last remedy, when they had
no other hopes to recover their spirits.
This might possibly have been better brought in among my forein discourses, but depend|ing
upon one of the ancientest and most important Ceremonies of the Roman Common|wealth,
lest I should divide my matter, and give too much occasion to look back, I thought
it not improper to insert it in this place.


CHAP. XVI.
A people accustomed to the dominion of a Prince, though by accident they may
acquire their liberty, yet it is with great difficulty, if they maintain it.
IF the Records of ancient History will serve our turn, it is manifest by many examples, that
a people born and bred up in subjection to a Prince, cannot without great difficulty pre|serve
its liberty, if by any accident it attains it, as the Romans did upon the expulsion of the
Tarquins  not without reason; for the people is like a wild beast, (which, though naturally
fierce, disposed to live in the woods, and to find out dens and converts to conceal it self) yet hav|ing
been always brought up as it were in prison  servitude, if by accident it breaks its bonds
and escapes out into the field, it is in a maze, knows not whither to run, where to sustain, or
where to conceal it self, as having been accustomed to bondage and confinement; by which
means, if worth the looking after, it is easily recovered. It is the same with a people which
has lived always in subjection, who, understanding nothing of publick offence or defence,
and knowing as little of Princes as Princes do of them, are with the greatest ease imagina|ble
reduced to a yoke which is commonly more grievous than what they escaped from be|fore;
and this happens to them where they are not totally debauched (for where the Mass
is corrupted, they cannot subsist a moment): I speak now of those where the malignity is
not so diffused, but that there are still left more good men than bad; in which case another
difficulty does likewise occur, and that is, when-ever the yoke of tyrranny is shaken off, and
liberty set up, it follows continually that many enemies are created, whose interest it is to
subvert it, and no friends made that shall have any advantage by supporting it. By ene|mies
I mean all those privado's and favourites of Princes who have enjoyed the perferments
and wealth of their Master, and cannot but be disgusted to find themselves dispossessed;
wherefore they are constantly ready to take any occasion of restoring their old Prince, that
they themselves might be restored to their authority and employment. And for friends
whose interest it is that (upon the shaking off their Tyrant) their liberty should be preser|ved,
they are not to be expected, because in free States, honours and offices are confer'd
upon such as by their virtue, some great atcheivment for the benefit of the Common|wealth,
or some other honourable action have seemed to deserve them; and when a man
receives no more than what he thinks he has deserved, he ascribes it to his own merits ra|ther
than to the liberality of the State, and holds himself not obliged. Besides, the com|mon
utility resulting from a free State, though it be in their power, it is not at all in their
knowledg; for who is it that considers, or takes care that every man enjoys quietly what
God has given him; that their wives be not dishonoured, their children abused, nor their
fellows oppressed? For who is it that will think himself bound to any man for doing him
no wrong? and things being so, a free State newly acquired, never creates such friends as
will be half so solicitous for its conservation, as those enemies who have been dispossessed
of their fortunes and preferment will be to undermine it, and restore their old Master
again: and if it be enquired what course is to be taken against the inconveniences and
disorders which follow thereupon; there is not a more efficacious, safer, and more necessary
remedy, than to kill the Sons of Brutus, who (as History tells us) entred into a conspiracy
against the State, with other young Gentlemen of Rome, for no other reason but because
they could not be so loose and licentious under the Consuls as under the Kings; as if their
freedoms were incompatible, and the liberty of the people was servitude to them: where|fore
he who proposes to govern a people, whether by the way of Monarchy or Republick
and does not secure himself of those who are adverse to the change, must never think to
effect, or at least to enjoy it long: and on the other side, it is convenient he should know
the infelicity of those Princes who cannot secure their Dominion without murder and
blood; by which means the multitude is incensed, and become mortally their enemies: he

who has but few enemies may secure it the better; but where the multitude is provoked, no
security is to be had; and the more cruelty is used, the weaker the Government; so that
when all's done the surest remedy is to indulge the people, and make them your friends.
And now (though I may seem something confused and immethodical in speaking sometimes
of a Prince, and then of a Republick) I shall take the liberty to do it here briefly, that I may
have no occasion hereafter. A Prince therefore who, by usurping upon the liberties of
the people, has made them his enemies, (if he desires to reconcile himself) is above all
things to consider what the people affect, and he shall find it to consist principally in two
things; one is, revenge upon those who have been instrumental in their slavery; and the
other is restitution of their liberty. In the first the Prince may gratifie them fully, in the
second but in part. Of the first we have an exact instance. Clearchus Governour of He|raclia
being banished for his tyranny, a controversie betwixt the Nobility and the Commons
hapning afterwards in that Town, it fell out, that the Nobility finding themselves the
weaker, addressed to Clearchus, and having entred into confederacy with him, they gave
him admission and overcoming the people, he took away their liberties. But Clearchus
perceiving himself in the clutches of the Nobility, and not only subject to their insolence,
(which was neither to be satiated nor corrected) but to the rage and fury of the multitude,
which could by no means digest his encroachments upon their liberty, he resolved at one
blow to rid himself of his Grandees, and reconcile himself to the people, and taking his
opportunity, he cut off all his Nobility with great satisfaction to the rest. The other
thing which they desire with so much favour is restitution of their liberty in which the
Prince cannot totally comply without degrading himself: he is therefore to examine upon
what grounds the people are so fond of it, and he will find that some few indeed are zea|lous
for their liberty, in hopes of office and preferment; but the greatest part desire it only
to be secure against oppression, and to live comfortably, and at ease. For in all Governments,
whether Republick or Monarchical, forty or fifty men go away with all the commands and
offices of importance, which number being small, it is no hard matter for a Prince to secure
himself against them, by cutting them off, or by such addition to their former advantages
as may in some measure oblige them.
The rest, whose aim is only to live quietly, are easily satisfied by constituting such Laws
and Ordinances as may make the power of the Prince consistant with the security of the
people. If a Prince does this, and be observed upon no accident what-ever to violate their
Laws, the people will quickly be contented, and believe themselves safe. And of this the
Kingdom of France is an example; being quiet, and at peace, because the Kings are bound
by innumerable Laws, which comprehend the security of the Subject; for by the first in|stitution
of that Monarchy, the Kings have the disposition of their Revenue, and the ma|nagement
of their Armies, but in every thing else they are circumscribed by the Laws. That
Prince therefore, or Commonwealth, which at its first erection secures not it self, is obliged
to do it at the first opportunity, as the Romans did when they murdered the Sons of Brutus,
and he that slips it will repent when 'tis too late: for the people of Rome (not yet entirely
corrupted) having recovered their liberty, it was sufficient to maintain it, that they made
away the Bruti, and extinguished the Tarquins, which otherwise was not to have been done,
had the whole mass and body of the people been debauched, as I shall shew in the following
Chapter.


CHAP. XVII.
A people wholly corrupted in their manners, may possibly recover their liberty,
but they will find insuperable difficulty to maintain it.
HAd not Kings been expelled as they were in Rome, that City, in my opinion, must of
necessity have declined, and its ancient virtue  the authority been lost; for if the cor|ruption
of those Kings be considered, had it been propagated but to the third succession it
would easily have diffused it self among the people; and that being infected, nothing could
have preserved the City, much less have restored it to its former vigour and reputation;
but the trunk being entire, and the distemper only in the head; by taking off that, the
members were capable of being preserved. and their liberty recovered. And this may
be laid down as a positive truth, that a City accustomed to the dominion of a Prince (if
the manners of the people be corrupted) can never make it self free, though the Prince and
his whole race be extinguished; for some new Lord or other will always spring up, unless

by accident the courage and fortune of some good Citizen concurs to its preservation; and
even then its liberty will be continued no longer than the life of that person; as it hapned
in Syracuse, which remained free during the lives of Dion and Timoleon, (though in different
times) but when they were dead, it relapsed, and fell under the same tyranny as before:
but the most evident example of all was in Rome which City having turned out the Tar|quins,
found out a way of setting up, and maintaining their liberty a long time; yet when
Coesar was slain, and Caligula, Nero: and the whole race of the Caesars extirpated; the Ro|mans
were so far from maintaining it, that they could not so much as introduce the least
form or appearance of liberty; and the reason of that diversity in the same City was no
other, but because in the time of the Tarquins the people were not generally so vitious as
afterwards in the reign of Caligula and Nero: for at the expulsion of the Tarquins, to possess
the people then against tyranny, it was sufficient to tender them an oath, by which they en|gaged
never to admit single person again in Rome: whereas afterwards, upon the death of Cae|sar
and the rest, neither the authority nor rigour of Brutus, with all his Legions in the East
was able to dispose the people to the assertion of that liberty which so happily had been set
up by the first of Brutus his name. So strangely had the Faction of Marius diffused their
poison among the Commons, of which Caesar being head, he had opportunity of blinding
the people, and coaxing them into servitude so slily, they could not perceive the yoke into
which they were thrusting their necks. Though this example of the Romans be pregnant
enough, yet it is not brought in for any want in our own times. For in Naples and Milan
the manners of the people being totally debauched, nothing could do, no opportunity could
restore them to a condition of liberty. 'Tis true, upon the death of Philip Viscnti, the
Milaneses attempted, but they could never effect it. For which reason it was very happy
for the Romans that their Kings discovered their depravity so soon; for by that means they
were driven out before their wickedness could dilate, and spread it self among the people;
which if it had done, the troubles and tumults which succeeded thereupon had never had so
good end, as to make rather for the advantage than prejudice of the City: from whence it
may be infer'd, that where the multitude is not corrupt, tumults and disorders do no very
great mischief; where it is corrupt, Laws may be well constituted and provided, and ye
do no good; unless executed by some person so severely, that the people are compelled to
observe them, and by strict observation to become good; which is a thing I can neither
say has hapned hitherto, or promise it ever will. For it is clear, (as I said before) that a
City declining, upon the corruption of the Mass, can never recover, unless it be by the virtue
and magnanimity of some active Citizen, who takes the administration of Justice into his
own hands, and sees every thing faithfully performed, and even then, that good man is
no sooner in his grave, but the people are in their old servitude again. Thus it fell out
with the Thebans; Epaminondas, by his virtue and conduct, enabled them to keep up a
form of a Common wealth whilst he was alive, but, alas, at his death it was quickly dissolved;
the reason is, because no man is sufficiently long lived, to reclaim a City that has been long
accustomed to licentiousness, and to reduce it to be good. So that though it happens to
have such a good man among them, and he lives a long time; nay though there be two
successions of good men, if the third (as I said before) be defective, all goes to wrack, it
must necessarily be ruined, unless by many dangers, and great effusion of blood it happens
to be preserved; because that corruption which renders it so unapt and indisposed to a free
life, proceeds from the great inequality in that City and to reduce things to an equality,
extraordinary ways must be used which few people know, and fewer will take, as shall be
shewn more particularly in another place.


CHAP. XVIII.
A corrupt City having made it self free, how its liberty may be maintained;
and not having made it self, how its liberty may be procured.
I Think I shall not be extravagant, if to what has been said already, I add another quaery
Whether, in a corrupt City, a free State may be maintained (if by any accident it be set
up); or, if there be no such thing already, how it is to be obtained? I answer, both of
them are hard; and though a certain rule cannot be prescribed, (unless we knew the degrees
of its corruption); nevertheless, it being good that every thing be fairly discust, this que|stion
shall not be suffered to pass.

I shall presuppose, that the City of which I speak is corrupt in extremity, and in that
case the difficulty encreases with proportion; for no Laws nor Customs can restrain an uni|versal
depravity; because, as good Customs cannot subsist without good Laws, so good
Laws cannot be executed without good Customs: besides, the Laws which are made in the
minority and innocence of a Commonwealth, are not sutable or efficacious when it is
grown wicked and robust; for the Laws of a City do vary upon several accidents and emer|gencies,
but the Statutes and fundamental Orders are seldom or never changed, for which
reason new Laws are not so necessary afterwards, as good Statutes at first: but to illustrate
it farther. By ancient Statute and Custom time out of mind, the Commonwealth of
Rome was divided betwixt the Senate and the People, and all authority was derived either
from the People, or Senate, or Tribunes, or Consuls; as also their creation of Magistrates,
and enacting of Laws: these Customs were little (if at all) changed in all the revolutions
of that State; but the Laws for punishing malefactors, and regulating enormities, were
enacted or repealed as the exorbitance of the people did fluctuate and require, as the sump|tuary
Laws, the Law against adultery, ambition, and several others, instituted from time to
time, as the Citizens grew corrupter. But the old customs of State being retained, (though
tainted, and sharing in the corruption of the people) the reviving of old Laws, or intro|ducing
of new, was not sufficient to keep the Citizens good, but it would have contributed
much, had the old Customs been reform'd when those new Laws were introduced, and a
new form of Government set up: for that those ancient Customs are of no use or advan|tage
where a City is overflown with such a deluge of corruption, is apparent by their me|thods
in the creation of Magistrates, and the exhibition of Laws. The Consulship, nor
any other office or dignity was never confer'd by the people of Rome upon any body but by
formal application, which Custom was originally very good, because none sought for them
who was conscious of being unfit; forasmuch as to be repulsed was a dishonourable thing,
and to make himself sit, every man chose to be virtuous. But afterwards the manners
of the people growing so fatally corrupt, this Custom lost its primitive convenience, and
became not only useless but pernitious; for they who had most power, not they who had
most virtue and capacity, pretended to the Magistracy; the poor and the virtuous not da|ring
to appear for fear of an ignominious repulse: but this inconvenience (like the City it
self) was not the product of a day, it stole into the Commonwealth, lay concealed, en|creased,
and exerted it self by degrees, as all other inconveniencies do.  having con|quered
Africa and Asia, and reduced the greatest part of Greece, the Romans began to hug
themselves in their liberty, as not knowing any enemy they ought in reason to fear: this
security and unhappy scarcity of enemies was the occasion that in their creation of Consuls
the people of Rome began to regard riches and favour more than ability and virtue; prefer|ring
such persons as could entertain and treat people handsomely, before such as were grave,
and could only conquer their enemies; afterwards, from those who were most plausible,
they came down, and created such as were most powerful; so that persons of virtue and
capacity were totally excluded. In the making of Laws, a Tribune and any one Citizen
had power to propose any thing to the people which they thought of importance to the
publick; before whom it was canvas'd and discuss'd, every man having free liberty to ob|ject,
or promote it (as his judgment directed) before it could pass.
And this Custom was good likewise whilst the Citizens were so too; for it was always,
and is still convenient, that if any man be wiser than the rest, and can contrive any thing
for the security or benefit of the publick, that he have liberty to propose it; and it is as use|ful
on the other side, every man have the same freedom to ventilate and examine it;
that all being well argued, and every mans opinion heard, the best may be chosen. But as
the Citizens grew corrupt, this Custom grew incommodious: none but great men proposed
any thing to the people, and what they did was not for the common, but their own private
interest, and which was worse, no man had the liberty to dispute it; so that the people were
either circumvented, or forced to consent to their own ruine and destruction. So then, to
have maintained Rome free in such an age of corruption, it was necessary, as they altered
their Laws according to the prevalence of each vice, so they should have altered their fun|damentals,
in the making of Laws, and creation of Magistrates; for the same Customs are
not equally convenient where the people are not equally good, no more than the forms can
be alike where the matter is contrary. But 'tis worth our inquity whether these Customs
be to be reform'd at a blow, as soon as their inconvenience is descried, or by degrees, before
every body observes them. I say both of them are almost impossible: for to alter them by
degrees, requires some wise and sagacious Citizen, that can foresee the dangers at a distance,
and trace them to their first causes; but of such persons perhaps a City may never see one,
or if it does, how hard is it for him to persuade other people: for people accustomed to a

way are not easily got out of it, especially when the mischief is rather in probability than
prospect. And when these old Customs are to be reformed, (as appearing unprofitable
and dangerous for the Commonwealth) though they be easily discovered, they are hard to
be removed, especially at once; because the common mass being infected, common ways
are too weak; and recourse must be had to extraordinary, as violence and arms; for before
the fabrick of the Government can be changed and modelled to your desire, 'tis necessary
above all things to make your self Master of the City, and to be able to dispose of it at
your pleasure: and because to reform a State, and reduce it to a Civil Regiment, presup|poses a good man; and to usurp, and make ones self Prince by violence, presupposes an ill;
therefore it seldom falls out that a good man makes himself Prince by unjust means, be his
ends never so good; nor will an ill man, who has made himself Prince, ever do good it
never falls into his thoughts to imploy that authority well which he has unjustly acquir'd.
From the causes aforesaid therefore arises the difficulty (or rather impossibility) in a cor|rupt
City, to maintain a free State, much less to erect one; and if there should be any way
found out to effect it, it would (in my judgment) be necessary to frame it rather according
to a Regal than a Popular State; that those persons whose insolence is incorrigible by the
Laws, may be bridled and restrained by some supreme Magistrate in the nature of a King;
and to attempt any other way, must be either vain and temerarious, or exorbitantly cruel.
For though Cleomenes (being a single person) killed the Ephori, (as is said before) and Ro|mulus,
his Brother, and Titus Tatius, and afterwards imployed their authority to the ad|vantage
of the publick; yet it is to be considered, that the subjects neither of the one or
the other were so vitious or depraved as those of whom we have treated in this Chapter,
and therefore they were able to do what they pleased, and excuse it when it was done.


CHAP. XIX.
Though a weak Prince succeeds an excellent, the Government may stand; but if one weak Prince succeeds another, 'tis impossible.
IF the virtue and conduct of Romulus, Numa, and Tullius (the three first Kings of Rome)
be considered, it will be found to have been much for the advantage of that City to have
its first King martial, and fierce; the second King, quiet and religious; and the third (like
the first) active, and war-like again. For, as after the first institution, it was necessary
there should be some-body to dispose the people to ways of Religion, and civil conversa|tion;
so it was necessary again after that, that the next King should reassume the vigour
and magnanimity of their predecessor; otherwise the minds of the Citizens would have
grown effeminate, and the City have become a prey to any of its neighbours. Wherefore
it is to be considered, that a Prince not altogether so valiant and enterprizing, may main|tain
the Government upon the score of his Predecessor, and injoy the fruits of his courage
and labour; but if it happens he be long lived, and that he is not succeeded by a martial
Prince to revive the activity of the Founder, the Government must necessarily be ruined.
On the other side, if two Princes immediately succeeding, are martial and heroick, they are
observed to do great things, and to advance the Government exceedingly: David, without
doubt, was a person no less excellent in military experience than in learning and wisdom;
and so great was his courage, that he left his Kingdom to his Son Solomon in quiet and
peace, who by arts of peace rather than war injoyed it happily his time upon account of
his Father; but he could not leave it to Rehoboam as he had received it of his Father: for
Rehoboam being neither like his Grand-father in courage, nor his Father in wisdom, succeeded
scarcely to the sixt part of his Empire. Bajazet the Turkish Scholar, though more studious
of peace than of war, injoyed the labours of Mahomet his Father, who having (like Da|vid)
subdued all his neighbours, left him a Kingdom entire, that might be peaceably main|tained;
but had (Bazjazet's Son) Selimus now reigning, taken after his Father, and not
his Grand-father, that Empire had been ruined; but he out-goes the glory of his Grand|father.
From hence may be observed, that after an excellent  magnificent Prince, a pusillanimous
may succeed, and the Government stand; but if one poor-spirited Prince succeeds another
immediately, 'tis impossible it should subsist, unless (like France) it be supported by its old Cu|stoms
and Laws: I call those Princes weak and pusillanimous, who are not conversant, nor
addicted to the exercise of Arms, and do conclude, that the tranquillity of Numas's Reign
(which continued for many years) was to be attributed to the courage and activity of Ro|mulus,

which was revived again in Tullus the third King, after whom followed Ancus, a
Prince of so excellent a temper, that he knew how to comport as well in the calms of peace
as the tempests of war. His first practice was gentle, and by methods of peace, but finding
he was look'd upon as effeminate, and grew contemptible to his neighbours, he perceived
the way to preserve his dignity, was, to betake himself to martial courses, and manage his
affairs rather like Romulus than Numa. From hence an useful example for all Princes may
be taken, and it may be observed, that whoever is in the possession of a State, and follows
the example of Numa, may either keep it, or lose it, according to the different circum|stances
of fortune, or time. But he who imitates Romulus, and is arm'd with wisdom and
prowess, shall be sure to keep it, unless some extraordinary and irresistible power intervenes
to supplant him. And 'tis in probability to be thought, that had not the third King of
Rome prov'd a martial Prince, and one who knew by his Arms to recover his declining re|putation,
he could never (or with great difficulty) have regained it, or performed those
exploits which he did afterwards: so that whilst Rome was a Monarchy, and under the
Government of Kings, it was under a double danger of destruction, either by the mildness;
or the tyranny of its Prince.


CHAP. XX.
Two good Princes, immediately succeeding, may do great things; and well-grounded
Common-wealths having always a virtuous succession, their Con|quests
and Acquisitions must of necessity be according.
WHen Monarchy was banished by the Romans, their dangers were banished with
them, and they lay under no fear of either weak Prince or Tyrant; for the com|mand
of the Empire was put into the hands of the Consuls, who came to that authority, not
by inheritance, or any indirect or violent ambition, but by the suffrage of the people, and
were always excellent persons. The City of Rome enjoying from time to time the benefit
of their fortune and virtue, might without much difficulty arrive at the highest top of
greatness and dignity, (as it did) in the same number of years as it was under the Govern|ment
of Kings. For we see in the examples of Philip of Macedon, and his Son Alexander
the great, that a succession of two martial Princes (without a peaceable interposed) is
sufficient to conquer the World. And if it were possible in a Monarchy, 'tis easie in a
Commonwealth, in whose power it is to elect, not only two, but an infinite and continu|ed
succession of virtuous persons; so that in a well-ordered Commonwealth, the succession
is constantly good.


CHAP. XXI.
How much that Prince or Commonwealth is to be condemned, which neglects
to train up Souldiers of its own.
THE Princes and Commonwealths of our times, if to defend themselves, or offend their
enemy, (as occasion serves) they be unable to bring Souldiers of their own into the
Field, they may thank themselves, and acknowledge (with Tullus) that 'tis not so much
want of capacity in their subjects, as want of wisdom in them for neglecting to train them
For when Tullus came to the Crown, Rome had been forty years together in peace, (during
all Numa's Reign) and there was not a man to be found who had ever seen the face of an
enemy, nevertheless his own designs being martial, he resolved to make no use of the Sam|nites
or Tuscans, or any other Mercenary, but as a wise Prince, to discipline his own; and
his art and experience was such, that in a short time he made them excellent Souldiers; and
there is nothing more certain, than that where men are unapt for war, the fault is not in the
situation or nature of the place, but in the carelesness or defect of the Magistrate; of which
we have a fresh and memorable example. There is scarce any body ignorant, that of late
years the English invaded France, and entertained no Souldiers but their own; and yet,
though England had had no wars of thirty years before, and had neither Officer nor Souldier
who had ever seen a Battel, they ventured to attack a Kingdom where the Officers were
excellent, the Souldiers very good, having been trained up for several years together in the

Italian wars. This proceeded from the prudence of the Prince, and the excellence of that
Government, in which (though in times of peace) the exercise of Arms is not intermitted;
Pelopidas and Epaminondas having relieved Thebes, and rescued it from the tyranny of the
Spartans, finding themselves in the middle of a servile and effeminate people, they so or|dered
it by their virtue and discipline, that they brought them to the use of Arms, took the
field with them against the Spartans, and overthrew them. From whence that Historian
infers, that there are Souldiers not only in Lacedemon, but where-ever there are men, if
there be any body to exercise and train them; which Tullus performed most exquisitely
among the Romans, and is most excellently expressed by Virgil, in these words.
Desidesque movebit
Tullus in arma viros.
No soft unactive people Tullus knows,
But trains up all promiscuously to blows.


CHAP. XXII.
What is to be observed from the Combat betwixt the three Roman Horatii,
and the three Alban Curiatii.
BY Articles betwixt Tullus King of Rome, and Metius King of Alba, it was agreed,
that whichsoever of the two sides should overcome, that King should have the do|minion
of the other. The Curiatii were all killed; but one of the Horatii being left,
Metius and his Albans fell into subjection to the Romans.
Horatius returning in great triumph into the City, and meeting a Sister of his (who was
married to one of the Curiatii) lamenting the loss of her Husband, in a great passion
he killed her; for which inhumanity being brought to his trial, he was, after many argu|ments,
discharged, but more upon his Fathers intercession than his own merits. In which
accident there were three things considerable; that we are never to venture our whole for|tune
upon the success of a Party; another is, that offences and deserts are not equally re|warded
a well-ordered City; the third, that no compact is well made, where the per|formance
is or ought to be suspected. For to become servile, and in subjection to another
City, is a thing of such moment and importance, that it is not to be believed that any
Prince or State whatsoever should be content that their liberty should be exposed to the
success or courage of three of their Citizens; and this was evident in Metius; for though
upon the Victory of the Romans he seemed to acquiesce, and promised obedience, as by
Articles was agreed, yet in the first Expedition the Romans undertook against the Veientes,
'tis manifest he would have deceived Tullus, as one who repented of the covenants which
he had made: but because of the third we have spoken largely already, in the next two
Chapters we shall speak only of the other two.


CHAP. XXIII.
That our whole fortune is not to be ventured upon part of our force, and that
for that reason the keeping of passes is many times dangerous.
IT was never thought discretion to put your whole fortune in danger, unless your whole
force was ready to defend it. This error is committed several ways; one is when, like
Tullus and Metius, they commit the fortune and virtue of so many men as either of them
had in their Army, to the fortune and virtue of three particular persons, which was but
a pitiful part of either of their strength, not considering how, by that agreement, all the
pains which their Predecessors had taken to establish their liberty, and enable their fellow
Citizens to defend it, was rendred vain and ineffectual, by putting it into the power of three
persons to destroy it; than which (in my judgment) those two Kings could not have done
worse. Another great error is, when, upon the approach of an enemy, we trust all to the
keeping of an avenue, or the defence of a pass, unless it may be done with our whole
force: in that case indeed the resolution is good; but if the passage be narrow, and not

room enough for your whole power, it is uncertain and dangerous; and that which per|suades
me to be of that opinion, is the example of such as having been invaded by a potent
Enemy, though their Country was environed with Mountains and Rocks, yet they would
not attend, and engage the Enemy upon the passes or Mountains, but marched out of their
holds to encounter him; or else (which is as bad) they forsook their advantages, and
expected him in some plain or convenient place within: And the reason is (as aforesaid)
because many men cannot be brought to defend such places as are Rocky, for want of sub|sistance;
and the passage being streight, it can receive but few people, and by consequence
is not able to sustain the insult of a very great Army, and the Enemy may bring as may as
he pleases to attack it, because his business is not to fix there, but to pass thorow and be gone:
whereas he who is to defend it, cannot be in any considerable Body, being (by reason of
the uncertainty of the Enemies approach) to lie there continually, though (as I said be|fore)
the places are both barren and streight. Having lost therefore that pass which you
imagined to keep, and upon which your Army and People did wholly rely, the remainder
of your Army, and Subjects are possessed with such a fear, that you can have no farther
trial of their courage, but all goes to wrack, and your whole fortune lost, but with part of
your Army. With what difficulty Hannibal passed the Alps betwixt France and Lombardy,
and betwixt Lombardy and Tuscany, there is no body ignorant; nevertheless the Romans
chose rather to attend him upon the Tesin, and afterwards in the plain of Arezzo, where
the danger was equal both to the Enemy and them; than to carry their Army up into the
clouds upon the Rocks and the Snow, to be consumed by the incommodity of the place,
before the Enemy came at them. And whosoever shall read History deliberately, shall find
few great Captains that would coop themselves up in such passes and streights, not only
for the reasons abovesaid, but because all of them cannot be stop'd the Mountains in that
respect being like the fields, having not only their Roads and High-ways, but by-paths
and passages, which though not observed by Strangers, are well enough known to the In|habitants,
who will be always ready to conduct the Enemy, to remove them farther off
who lie constantly upon them. Of this a late Example may be brought, in the year 1515,
when Francis King of France design'd to pass into Italy for the recovery of Lombardy, the
great objection by those who were against the Expedition, was, That the Swizzers
would obstruct his passage over the Mountains, which argument was found idle after|wards,
for the Kings of France waving two or three places which they had guarded, passed
by a private and unknown way, and was upon their backs in Italy, before they perceiv'd
him; so that being mightily surprized, the Enemy quitted his Posts, and retired into Italy,
and all the Lombards submitted to the French; they being deceived in their opinion, who
thought the French were with more Ease and Convenience to be obstructed in the Moun|tains.


CHAP. XXIV.
In well Ordered Governments, offence and desert are never set one against the
other, but he who does well, is rewarded, and he who does otherwise, is
punished.
THE merits of Horatius were very great, having by his own single valor and conduct,
overcome the Curiatii; after which he committed a most abominable act, in killing
his own Sister: which Murther was so hainous in the Eyes of the Romans, that he was
brought to a Trial for his life, though his deserts were so fresh and considerable; which at
first sight seem ingrateful in the people; but he who examins it strictly, and weighs how
necessary and sacred a thing Justice ought to be in every Common-wealth, will find them
more blameable for discharging, than they would have been for condemning him; and the
reason is, because in a well constituted State no man's good actions should indemnisie him
for doing ill; for punishment being as due to ill actions, as rewards are to good, having
rewarded in a man for doing well, he is satisfied for what he did, and the obligation dischar|ged;
so as if afterwards he commits a Crime, he is to be punished severely according to the
Nature of his offence; by the observation of which Orders, a City may continue free a long
time, which otherwise will quickly go to ruine. For if a Citizen having perform'd any
great Exploit for his Country, should expect not only honor and reward for what he has
done, but priviledge, and impunity for any mischief he should do afterwards, his insolence
would in a short time grow insupportable, and inconsistent with Civil Government. So

then it is very necessary for discouragement from ill actions, to recompense good, which
was the practice in Rome, and though where a Common-wealth is poor, her twards can|not
be great; yet even out of that small stock, she is to be punctually grateful, for a thing
(how little soever) given in acknowledgment of ones good Service (let it be never so great)
is look'd upon as Honorable, and received as a Magnificent reward. The Stories of Hora|tius
Cocles, and Mutius Scaevola are generally famous. Coles with incomprable courage
maintained fight against a great body of the Enemy upon the Bridge over Tiber, till it was
cut behind him, and their passage obstructed: The other designing against the life of Por|senna
King of Tuscany, and killing his Secretary by mistake, being apprehended and brought
before the King, to show the courage and constancy of the Romans, he thrust his own hand
into the fire, and burnt it off before his face; and how were they gratified? marry each
of them had two Staiora's, which is as much ground as can be sown with two Bushels of
Corn. The History of Manlius Capitolinus is no less remarkable: Having relieved the Ca|pitol
(which the French had surprized in the night) and beaten them out again, his Come|rades
in requital gave him a certain measure of Flower, which (as times went then) was a
mighty reward, and esteemed so adequate to the Service, that Manlius afterwards either out
of ambition or ill nature, causing a tumult in Rome, and endeavouring to debauch the peo|ple,
(his former exploits being as they thought amply rewarded) without farther regard to
him, they threw him headlong down that Capitol, which he had so gloriously preserved.


CHAP. XXV.
Though it is many times convenient to reform the old Fundamental Customs of a
free City, yet it is convenient still to retain some shadow and appearance of
their ancient ways.
HE who desires to set up a new form of Government in a Common-wealth, that shall
be lasting, and acceptable to the people, is with great caution to preserve at least
some shadow and resemblance of the old, That the people may (if possible) be insensible
of the innovation; for the generality of Mankind do not penetrate so far into things, but
that outward appearance, is as acceptable to them as verity it self. For this cause the Ro|mans
at the beginning of their liberty, when their Kings were expelled, thought it expe|dient
to create two Consuls instead of one King, assigning them only XII Lictors, that
their number might not exceed what attended upon the King. Besides this, there was an
anniversary Sacrifice in Rome, in which the Ministry of the King was of necessity required:
To salve that defect, the Romans created a chief of the said Sacrifice with the Title of
Royal Priest (but with subordination to the High Priest) by which Artifice the people
were satisfied with their Sacrifice, and took no occasion to complain for the expulsion of
their King. He therefore who desires to reform the policy of a State, and to introduce a
new, is to disguise it to the people by the retention (at least in appearance) of some part
of the ancient Customs, that may keep them from discerning it; and if at any time by
accident there be a necessity of changing the power, the number and duration of the Magi|strates,
it will be convenient to continue the Name. This (as I said before) is to be ob|served
by any one who would establish an absolute power either in a Republick; or
Monarchical way, but he who would erect such an absolute power, as by Authors is called
Tyrannies must unravel the whole bottom, and innovate all.


CHAP. XXVI.
A new Prince in a new Conquest, is to make every thing new.
WHoever makes himself Lord of a City or State (and especially if he finds himself
weak, and suspects his ability to keep it) if he intends not to continue the Go|vernment
in the old way, either by Kingship or Common-wealth, the best course he can
take is to subvert all, to turn every thing topsie turvy; and make all things as new as him|self.
To alter the Magistracy, create new Titles, elect new persons, confer new Autho|rities,
advance the Poor, and impoverish the Rich, that what is said of David, may be
said of him, Esurientes implevit bonis,  divites dimisit inanes. He filled the hungry with

good things, and the rich he sent empty away. Besides it is his interest to build new Cities,
to erect new Corporations; to demolish and uncharter the old; to shift the Inhabitants
from one place to another; in a word, so to toss and transpose every thing, that there be
no honor, nor wealth, nor preferment in the whole Province, but what is ownable to him.
And for this he need go no farther than Philip of Macedon (Father to Alexander the Great)
for his pattern, who by this practice, of a small Prince, made himself Monarch of all Greece,
of whom it is said, That he removed his people, as a Shepheard did his fold. Those ways
are cruel, and contrary not only to all civil, but to all Christian, and indeed human con|versation;
for which reason they are to be rejected by every body, for certainly 'tis better
to remain a private person, than to make ones self King, by the calamity and destruction
of his people. Nevertheless, he who neglects to take the first good way, if he will pre|serve
himself, must make use of this bad; for though many Princes take a middle way
betwixt both, yet they find it extream difficult and dangerous; for being neither good nor
bad, they are neither fear'd nor belov'd, and so unlikely to prosper.


CHAP. XXVII.
Men are as seldom perfectly bad, as they are perfectly good.
IN the year 1505. Pope Iulius II. marched his Army into Bologna to drive the Family
of the Bentivogli out of that State, where they had commanded with Supremacy a
hundred years. In the same Expedition he resolved to remove Iohn Pogolo Baglione out
of Perugia (where he had Usurped) and in a word, all such Tyrants as had got any Church
Lands into their possession. Coming to the Town with the desire and resolution aforesaid,
he attended not till he could march in with his Army; but enter'd as it were naked and
disarmed (though Iohn Pagolo was in person in the City, and many of his party which
were got together to defend him) so that transported with the usual vehemence where|with
he managed all his affairs, he put himself (with his bare guards) into the hands of
his Enemy; yet he succeeded so well, that he carried Pagolo off with him, and put in
another Governor in behalf of the Church. Wise men who were then about his Holiness,
admiring the temerity of the one, as much as the pusillanimity of the other, could not ima|gine
how it should come to pass, that Pagolo having his Enemy as it were naked in his
hands, and by consequence an opportunity (with perpetual glory to himself) to have se|cured
him, and pillaged his Equipage (for all the Cardinals were then with him, with the
most precious of their Jewels) should so strangely neglect it; especially when they consi|dered
that it was neither Conscience nor good nature which restrained him; for neither of
those were to be supposed in a man who had been nought with his own Sister, and mur|ther'd
several of his Relations, to make his way to the Government; wherefore it was
concluded to happen, because it is so provided by providence, that no man can be exqui|sitely
wicked, no more than good in perfection; for where there is any thing great and
magnificent in a mischief, they know not how to commit it: So Iohn Pagolo who made no
bones of either Parricide or Incest, could not (or to speak more properly) durst not make
use of his opportunity to perpetrate a thing, which would have filled the world with admi|ration
of his courage, and made his memory venerable to posterity; for he would have been
the first who had given his Cardinals to understand how little it is to their reputation to
Lord it, and luxuriate as they do; and the greatness of the Fact would have lessened the
Scandal, and prevented any danger that might ensue.


CHAP. XXVIII.
For what reasons the Romans were less ingrateful to their Citizens,
than the Athenians.
WHoever reads and observes the passages in Commonwealths, will find a touch of
ingratitude towards their Citizens in them all, but less in Rome than in Athens;
and perhaps in any other Republick whatever. The reason (I suppose) was, because Rome
had not that occasion of Jealousie as Athens had: For in Rome, from the expulsion of the
Kings, to the time of Silla and Marius, the liberty of the City was never disturbed by any

man within it; so that there being no reason to apprehend, there was no reason to perse|cute.
In Athens it was otherwise; for their liberty being invaded and taken away by Pi|sistratus
when it was most flourishing, and compleat; and that by a pretence of advancing
it; They no sooner recover'd it; but remembring the injuries which they had received,
and their passed servitude, they flew out into such an exorbitancy of revenge, that they
punished not only the faults of their fellow Citizens, but the least umbrage, and appearances
of them, from whence followed the Banishment, and Execution of so many excellent
persons; Hence came the Ostracism Laws, and all the rest of the outrages committed after|wards
upon the chief of their City, for as ye Writers of Politicks observe very well, the
people are more cruel and vindicative who have lost and recovered their liberty, than they
who have preserved it, as it was left them by their Fathers. He therefore who considers
what is said, will neither condemn Athens, nor magnifie Rome; but impute all to necessity
upon the diversity of accidents which hapned in each City. And certainly, if it be seriously
considered, it will appear, that if the liberty of the Romans had been oppressed, as the
liberty of the Athenians was, Rome would have been no better natur'd, or shown more
compassion to its fellow Citizens, than Athens did: And this may be infallibly deduced
by what hapned (after the expulsion of the Kings) against Collatinus and P. Valrius;
for Collatinus (though he had been very active in asserting their liberty) was banished for
bearing only the Name of Tarquin; and the other had like to have ran the same destiny,
for building a house only, upon the top of Mount Celius, which they suspected was to com|mand
the City. So that it may probably be presumed (by its suspicion and severity
in the two cases aforesaid) that Rome would have exercised the same ingratitude, had
it been injured in its minority, as Athens had been. And that I may have no occasion
to discourse of ingratitude hereafter; I shall speak of it more largely in the following
Chapter.


CHAP. XXIX.
Whether the Prince, or the People, is most subject to be ingrateful.
ANd because we have undertaken to enlarge upon this subject, I think it not amiss to
examine which are most frequently guilty of ingratitude, the Prince, or the People:
For better explication, I say, That men are ingrateful, either out of suspicion, or avarice.
For if a Prince, or Republick send out any of their great Captains upon some important
Expedition, which the said Captain atchieves, and gains honor to himself, and reputation
to his Master, in this case the Prince, or State, is obliged to reward him; but if instead of
rewarding, they casheer, or disgrace him, or out of a covetous principle, deny him his
pay, the ingratitude is inexcusable: and leaves a scandal behind it that can never be worn
out, and yet many Princes are too guilty of it; Cornelius Tacitus gives us the reason in this
Sentence, Proclivius est injuriae, quam beneficio vicem exolvere, quia gratia oneri, ultio in
quaestu habetur. 'Tis more natural to return an injury, than a courtesie, because courtesies are
burthensom, but revenge is sweet. But if this ingratitude either in Prince or People, pro|ceeds
not so much from avarice, as suspicion, in that case it is somewhat excusable, and
of that kind we read of good store, as when a General has conquered a Province or
Empire for his Master, when he has exterminated his Enemies, enriched his Army, and
gain'd himself a great Name, 'tis impossible but he must be so acceptable to his own Sol|diers,
and so dreadful to his Enemies, as must beget a jealousie in the Prince; for the
Nature of man being jealous and ambitious, and not to be confined within the bounds of
his fortune, it cannot be but if the Prince has taken a fancy that the glory of his General, is
a diminution to his, the General must by some vain-glorious, or discontented action,
establish and confirm it; and then what has the Prince to do? but to secure himself either
by causing him to be murthered, by taking away his Command, lessening his reputation
with the Soldiers and People, and by all ways of industry possessing them, that the Victory
was not obtained by any Conduct of his, but by the kindness of Fortune, vileness of the
Enemy, or prudence and good management of the rest of the Officers.
After Vespasian (being in Iudea) was declared Emperor by his Army, Antonius Primus
being at the same time in Illyria with another Army, declared for the Emperor, and marched
into Italy against Vitellius who was then Paramount in Rome; and having beaten him in
two pitch'd Battels, he enter'd the City in the Name of Vespasian: So that Mutianus
being sent against Vitellius by Vespasian, he found the Enemy broken, the Town taken,

and all things done by Antonius to his hand. And how was he requited? Why Mutianus
took away his Commission, removed him from the Army, and by degrees so lessened his
Authority in Rome, that Antonius going into Asia to make his Complaints to Vespasian,
was received so coldly, that in a short time he was stript of all kind of authority, and died
very miserable: and of this Nature examples are very frequent in History; every body
knows how in our times Gonsalvo Ferrante, being the King of Arragon's General in the
Kingdom of Naples against the French, behaved himself so well, that by his singular
Conduct he conquered it, and put it wholly under the obedience of his Master, who coming
afterwards to Naples himself, took from him the Command of his Army, dispossessed him
of many strong places which he held in that Country, and carried him with him into
Spain, where not long after, he died in obscurity. But there is no remedy; these kind
of jealousies are so natural to Princes, that it is almost impossible for them to be grate|ful
to any man, who has performed any great thing for them. And if it be so with Kings,
no wonder if it be so with the people, for in a free State, they have always two principal
ends, one is to enlarge their Dominions, the other to keep what they have got, and their
eagerness to both these, makes them so often guilty of ingratitude. As to the first point,
we shall speak elsewhere; the errors in preserving their liberty; to disgust such persons as
ought to be rewarded, and to suspect such as ought to be trusted; and though such
practices are the occasion of great mischiefs in a corrupt Commonwealth, and Tyranny
does many times ensue (as in Rome by Caesar, who took that by force, which the ingrati|tude
of the people denied to his merits,) yet in a Town that is entire, and incorrupt, they
do very well, and add much to the duration of their liberty, to enforce great and ambitious
men for fear of punishment to comport themselves better. In my judgment of all the
Commonwealths that ever had Empire, Rome was the least ingratful for the reasons
abovesaid, there being never an Example of its ingratitude but in the case of Scipio: For
Coriolanus and Camillus were banished for their injuries to the people, and though one of
them remaining obstinate, was never recalled; yet the other was not only recalled, but so
restored to the affections of the people, that all his life after, they adored him as a Prince.
But their jealousie of Scipio was of such a sort, as had never been known before, proceeding
from the Ornaments of his body, and the endowments of his mind; His youth, his wis|dom,
his excellent qualifications had render'd him too admirable; the powerfulness of his
Enemy, the danger and tediousness of the War (which he had concluded in a very short
time) his deliberation in resolving, and his quickness in Execution, had gained him a
greater reputation, than was ever got by any General before him, insomuch as the Senators,
Pretors, and all the chief Magistrates in the City began to fear and respect him. This was
no pleasing sight to the graver sort, because it had not been formerly the Custom in Rome;
whereupon Cato (a man of great esteem for his piety and justice) took up the Cudgels
against him, and complained publickly that the City could not be called free, whil'st the
Magistrates were in awe of any particular Citizen; if then in a thing so nearly importing
their liberty, the people followed the opinion of Cato, in my judgment they were in some
measure to be excused. In short, my opinion is, as I said before, that it is avarice and
suspicion which makes men ingrateful: To the first of which the people are not naturally
addicted; and to the last, with much less propensity than Princes, as having less occasion,
which shall be proved hereafter.


CHAP. XXX.
What rules are to be observed by a Prince or Commonwealth to avoid this
Vice of ingratitude, and how a General or great Citizen is to demean him|self
to elude it.
TO avoid the necessity of living always in suspicion, and being ingrateful to his Mi|nisters,
a Prince ought to go personally with his Armies, as was done at first by the
Emperors of Rome, as the great Turk does now, and as all they do and have done that are
valiant and couragious; for in so doing, the honor and profit of their Victories accrews to
themselves; but where they are not present at their Conquests themselves, the honor re|dounds
upon their Officers, and they have not any compleat enjoyment of their successes,
till they have eclipsed, if not extinguished that glory in other people, which they durst not
venture for themselves; so that their ingratitude, and injustice to their Officers, does them
more mischief, than their Conquests do them good. But when out of negligence, or

imprudence, they lie at home idle themselves, and send their Generals in their stead,
know no better precept to give them, than what they know already themselves.
As to the General, if he finds that jealousie inevitable, he has his choice of two things.
As soon as the War is ended, he is voluntarily to lay down his Commission; and to pre|sent
it to his Master, before he has occasion to demand it, using great care that none of his
actions discover him to be either insolent or ambitious, that his Prince having no cause
to suspect him, may have the greater obligation to reward him. If this way does not please,
the other is quite contrary; and that is, to declare himself boldly, and try always to set
up for himself, cajoling and sweetning his Soldiers and Subjects, making new alliances
with his Neighbours, seizing upon the strong Towns, corrupting the Officers, and where
they will not be corrupted, securing them some other way, and by doing thus, he shall be
even with his Lord, for his ingratitude designed: And besides these two ways, there is
none that I know. But (as I said before) because men can neither be good nor bad in
extremity, it happens that great men are unwilling to quit their Commands, and retire
after the gaining of a Victory; behave themselves modestly they cannot: and to use rigour
in an honourable way is impossible. So that whil'st they are in suspence, and uncertain
which course to steer, they are many times destroyed. As to a Commonwealth that would
preserve and exempt it self from this detestable vice of ingratitude, the same remedy can|not
be prescribed, as was prescribed to a Prince; for not being able to manage its Wars
in Person as a Prince may do, the command of their Forces must of necessity be committed
to some of their Subjects. The best way they can take, is to follow the Example of Rome,
and that will render them less ingrateful than their Neighbors. In the wars of the Ro|mans,
by ancient Custom all people were employed, as well Nobles as others, and from
thence it came that they were always well furnished with Generals and Officers of all sorts,
which kept them from being jealous of any one, having so many of equal merit to oppose
him: Besides which, there were express Laws against ambition, and all people so narrowly
observed, that no man durst discover the least design or inclination that way; and in the
creation, of Dictators, he was commonly prefer'd, who debas'd himself most, or disco|vered
least desire to obtain it; by which means preventing the occasion of suspicion, they
prevented the ingratitude. That State therefore which would avoid the guilt of ingrati|tude,
is to imitate Rome, and that person who would avoid the effects, must observe how the
Romans defended themselves.


CHAP. XXXI.
That the Romans used no extraordinary punishments towards their great Cap|tains,
when they committed an Error of ignorance, or malice, provided the
Government was not damnified by it.
THe Romans (as I said before) were not only less unthankful, than their Neighbors
but they were more human and gentle in the punishment of their Generals, than
any other State; if their miscarriage was malicious, they punished it not severely; but if
it was by ignorance or mistake, instead of revenging, they did many times reward it; and
this they did upon very grave consideration, for the Romans understood the charge of an
Army to be so great a care, and of such transcendant importance, that whoever undertook
it, ought to have his mind free and indisturbed by any other respects or troubles whatso|ever,
for his thoughts being with his troubles, he would never mind his Army, nor take
any advantage. For Example, an Army is sent into Greece against Philip of Macedon, or
into Italy against Hanibal, or those people upon the Frontiers, which had been conquered
before, and the Captain who has the General Command, is loaden with all the cares which
do commonly attend great and extraordinary Enterprizes. Now if to those necessary
cares for his Army, there should be superadded a fear, and apprehension of being punished
at his return (if things went otherwise than well) and perpetual reflexion upon those who
have been abused and put to death upon the same score, it must needs disturb the tranquilli|ty
of his mind, and make him unfit for any great action. The wise Romans thought the
infamy and dishonour of losing a Battel, punishment enough, without heaping one affli|ction
upon another. And as to those whose errors proceed rather from malice than igno|rance,
we have another Example. Sargius, and Virginius had each of them an Army,
and were encamped before Veii: Sargius was posted against the Tuscans, and Virginius
on the other side against any body else. It hapned the Falisci having joyned with several

of their neighbors, came to fall upon Sergius. Sergius had notice, and found himself too
weak; yet rather than send to his Companion for supplies, he chose to be routed; and
Virginius on the other side, though he knew his distress, would by no means relieve him,
unless he desired it; so that that Roman Army was cut off by the ambition and emulation
of their Generals; a thing of very ill example, had it been suffered to pass without punish|ment.
Nevertheless, whereas other States would have punished them with death, Rome inflicted
only a pecuniary mulct, but their crime deserved sharper correction, but the Romans
were unwilling to do any thing against custom, which (as is said before) is very sacred with
them. As to the errors of ignorance, we have another example in Varro, by whose folly
and rashness the Romans having lost the Battel of Cannas against Hanibal, and brought
their whole Government in danger, had Hanibal known how to use, as well as gain a Vi|ctory;
yet his offence having in it more of ignorance than malice, when he came back, the
Senate went out to meet him in their Formalities, and not being able to congratulate his suc|cess,
they gave him thanks for his return, and that De salute reipublicae non desperasset,
That he did not despair of their affairs, When Papirius Cursor the Dictator would needs
put Fabius to death, because contrary to orders he had fought with the Samnites among
other reasons which the Father of Fabius urged against that sentence, this was one, that the
people of Rome had till that time never been so severe upon any of their Commanders
for the loss of a Battel, as Papirius would now be upon the Victor for gaining one.


CHAP. XXXII.
A Commonwealth or Prince is not to defer his beneficence till the necessity
of the object requires it.
THE liberality of the Romans to the people succeeded very well when Prosenna inva|ded
Rome in behalf of the Tarquins; for the Senate apprehending the people might
be brought to restore the Kings rather than endure the war, to oblige them, releast
their gabels upon salt, and all their other duties, declaring the people were sufficent bene|factors
to the publick; in providing, and bringing up their children: all which was done to
cajole them into such an humour as might make them endure the siege, and swallow the ca|lamities
of the War: but let no man rely upon this example, and defer his indulgence to the
people, till the enemy be upon his back; for it shall never succeed so well to him as it did
to the Romans, because the multitude will think themselves more obliged to the enemy than
to him, and believe, that when the necessity is over, they shall be as bad as before. The
reason why this way succeeded so happily to the Romans, was, because their State was but
new, and scarce setled, and the People were sensible that several Laws were made before for
their advantage and reputation; as particularly the Law of appeal to the people: so as they
were able to satisfy themselves that the benefits which were confer'd upon them by the Se|nate,
proceeded rather from a disposition in the Senate to do them good, than from any
apprehension of the enemy: besides, the injuries and outrages of their Kings lay fresh and
heavy upon their memories. But these cases hapning very seldom, 'tis but very seldom that
such remedies succeed; wherefore it is better for any Commonwealth or Prince to consider
the worst before-hand, and what people he is most like to have need of in time of adversity;
and to live so with them in time of prosperity, as that they may be encouraged to relieve
him upon any distress. And he who acts otherwise, whether Prince or Commonwealth,
(but especially a Prince) and presumes, when the danger is hanging over his head, that
it is time enough to favour the people, will find himself mistaken, and the people readier
to contribute to his ruine than defence.



CHAP. XXXIII.
If an inconvenience increases either within a State, or against it; it is better
to temporize and comply, than to endeavour to remove it by violence.
THe Roman Commonwealth increasing in Empire, Reputation and Force, their neigh|bours
not having considered it, nor what damage that greatness might pull down up|on
them, began now (when too late) to discover their error; and being willing to do that
now which had been more easie before, forty little States of them confederated against Rome.
The Romans, among their usual provisions in case of imminent danger, created a Dictator,
who, without any mans advice, might resolve as he pleased, and execute his resolutions
without being called to an account. This Magistrate was not only the occasion of over|coming
their enemies at that time, but was very useful upon all accidents afterwards when
their dominion increased. Which may teach us, that when either at home within, or
abroad against a Commonwealth, an inconvenience arises, (whether from an inward or an
outward cause it is not material) 'tis better counsel to comply and temporize, than to en|deavour
furiously to suppress it; for to resist, is to augment it, and to pull down upon our
heads what we were but afraid of before. And these kind of accidents fall out in a Com|monwealth
oftner from intrinsick than extrinsick causes, where the power and authority
of some Citizen is permitted to increase too fast, and more than is convenient for the ho|nour
or benefit of the State; or when such Laws are abrogated or neglected as were most
for the interest of their State; which error, if suffered to run on, will be more dangerous
to oppose than to comply with; for it is so much the harder to find out these inconvenien|cies
in the beginning, by how much 'tis natural for all people to favour every thing that is
new, especially if introduced by a young man, with the least shew or pretence of advan|tage:
for if a young Gentleman appears in a Commonwealth endued with more than or|dinary
qualities, the eyes of the whole City are immediately upon him, they run unani|mously
to respect him, and pay him all the honour that can be imagined; so that if he has
the least spark of ambition or vain-glory, he is presently puffed up, and inflamed with the
contemplation of his own worth, and the affection of the people: and when he is arrived
at such an height, as to be as visible as their error, then 'tis too late; there are but few re|medies
in the case; and when most of them are applyed, they do but magnifie his power.
Many examples might be brought to this purpose, but I shall only instance in one.
Cosimo di Medicis (from whom the famous Family of the Medici in our City had their
first grandeur) was in such reputation for his wisdom; and his fellow Citizens were so ig|norant,
that he began to be formidable to the State, and the Magistrates began to think it
difficult to take him down, but destructive to let him stand. There was at that time in
Florence a person of great experience in matters of State, called Nicolo da Uzano, who be|ing
well advised of the first fault which he had committed in not considering in time the
inconveniencies which might follow upon Cosimo's reputation, resolved to obviate the se|cond;
that is, that no force should be used to oppress him, as knowing that course would
be the ruine of the State; and so it proved not long after his death. For the Citizens
which remained, not following his counsel, began to combine, and fortifie against Cosimo,
and indeed forc'd him out of Rome. Whereupon, his party being increased, in a short time
called him home again, and made him their Prince, to which dignity he could never have
arrived, but by the opposition of his enemies.
The same hapned to Iulius Caesar, whose great virtue and excellent qualifications re|commended
him so highly to the favour of Pompey and the people, that by degrees he be|came
terrible, and their favour was turned into fear; of which Cicero complains, when he
says that Pompey began to fear him too late; for when his fear prompted him to look out
for a remedy, that remedy hastned the ruine of the State. I say then (when this case hap|pens)
it is incomparably better to temporize, than to endeavour to repel the mischief which
threatens by violence and force. For many times, by that means, it passes as it came, and
goes out of it self, or else the damage it brings is the longer a coming. In these cases
Princes ought to be very vigilant, lest going about to retrench and lessen the great power of
a neighbour, they give him opportunity to increase it, and bring themselves into greater
danger: you are therefore to compare your own strength, and your enemies; and if you
find your self the stronger, to attaque him couragiously; but if weaker, you had better be
quiet, lest it happens to you as it did to those little States who confederated against Rome,
to whom (as appeared by the event) it had been much better to have sate still, and endea|voured

their friendship, than to have irritated the great power of the Romans, and forc'd
them to a war; for the Romans had never got to that height, if that confederacy had not
given them occasion of trying all experiments for their defence, and put them among the
rest, upon the creation of Dictators, by which new invention they not only mastered all
dangers that threatned them, but prevented a thousand mischiefs into which (without that
remedy) the Commonwealth would most certainly have fallen.


CHAP. XXXIV.
The Dictatorship was useful, not hurtful to the Commonwealth of Rome; and
how that Power which is usurp'd, and illegally assumed, is pernitious to a
State, not that which is conferred legally by the suffrage of the people.
THere are those to be found who have said that the Dictatorship was the ruine and de|struction
of that Commonwealth, alledging that the first Tyrant that was ever in
that City, set himself up, under the title of Dictator, and affirming that Caesar could not un|der
any other name have justified his Tyranny.
Those who maintain that opinion did not examine it thorowly, and are not for that rea|son
to be believed. For it was not the name or dignity of the Dictator which brought
Rome into slavery, but the authority assumed by the Citizens upon the perpetuation of that
office; and if there had been no such thing as Dictator, Caesar had taken some other Title
upon him to compass his designs; for when ones power is absolute, he can assume what
name he pleases; but 'tis not a great Title that gives any man power. Whilst the Dicta|torship
was disposed by publick suffrage, it was very beneficial; those who attained it by
ways extraordinary, abused it exceedingly; the rest were never known to have done any
injury to the Commonwealth thorow all the Dictatorships: the reason is probable, because
a man must be endued with many good qualities before he can usurp such an authority.
He must be abundantly rich; he must know how to insinuate with every body; he must
have a great party, and make every man his friend, which is not practicable where the
Laws are in force; and if he had all those qualifications, they would render him so formi|dable,
that the free voices would ever concur in his election: besides, the Dictator was not
perpetual, but created only upon particular exigence, and with limited power, extending no
farther than the present danger, during which he had power to dispose of all things at his
pleasure, and punish as he thought good without any appeal; but he could do nothing in
diminution to the Government, he could not intrench upon the authority of the Senate or
People, abrogate their old Laws, or institute new: so that the shortness of his Dictatorship,
the limitation of his authority, and the incorruption of the people, made it impossible for
him to transgress, and do any mischief to the City; and on the contrary, that Office has
been always beneficial, and, in my judgment, the principal in Rome, and has contributed
more than all the rest to make it Mistress of the World; for without that, that City had
never been able to have obviated so many dangers, nor gone thorow so many difficulties,
against which their accustomed and ordinary means would have been of little validity, as
being too tedious, and slow; (no one Counsel or Magistrate being able to do all things alone
but being in a mutual necessity the one of the other) for in cases which require immediate
remedy, time passes away, and is often lost whilst they are in their counsels, and when they
come to a resolution, 'tis too late, and their remedies dangerous.
Wherefore I think it convenient that a Commonwealth have a certain way to be used
only in case urgent necessity, as the Seignory of Venice, (which at this day is the best re|gulated
Commonwealth in the World) that State in time of imminent danger has a re|served
power to confer authority upon some few of their Citizens, by virtue of which they
may order all as they please, without the consultation of the rest, for when a Common|wealth
is destitute of some such custom, it must of necessity be ruined by sticking to their
old, or break them to preserve it self; and it were to be wish'd that nothing might happen
in a Commonwealth that might give occasion for these extraordinary ways; for though
those extraordinary ways may sometimes be good, yet the example is ill, and introduces a
custom of breaking old orders for good, which afterwards, under that pretence, will be
broken for ill: wherefore that Commonwealth can never be perfect, that by its Laws has
not provided against every thing, prepared remedies for every accident, and appointed in
what manner they shall be managed; which is to be done no better way than by a Dicta|tor,
or some such Magistrate to be created upon extraordinary occasion; for without them

they must certainly be ruined: and one thing very remarkable in this order, is, the wisdom
of the Romans in the formality of its election: for the Dictators being introduced with
some diminution to the Consuls, (who being from heads of the City brought down to
obedience like other people, might possibly resent it, and in time be the occasion of dissen|tion
in the City) they committed their election into the hands of the Consuls, to the end
that upon any extraordinary emergence, when Rome should have occasion of so extraor|dinary
a Magistrate, the Consuls should comply the more willingly, because they had the
making them themselves; for the wounds which a man gives himself spontaneously, and
of his own election, are not so grievous as what he is forced for to bear. But towards the
latter end of their Empire, the Romans, instead of a Dictator, invested their Consul with
an equivalent authority in these words, Videat Consul, ne Respublica quid detrimenti capiat;
Let it be the Consuls care that the Commonwealth receives no prejudice. So that to return
to our matter, I conclude, that the neighbouring States conspiring against the Romans, and
endeavouring to oppress them, made them contrive better, not only for their defence, but to
put themselves into a posture, with more vigour, and counsel, and authority to repel their
invasion, and turn their force upon them.


CHAP. XXXV.
How it came to pass that the Creation of the Decem-virat was prejudicial to
the liberty of that State, though it was done freely, and by publick suffrage.
IN the last Chapter we have shewn that a power legally conferred, and by the suffrage of
the people, is not dangerous to the State; but that which is usurped, and gotten by force,
to which the election of the Decem-viri may seem to be contrary, who were chosen by the
people of Rome to make their Laws, and reform extravagancies in the Commonwealth,
which Decem-viri by degrees encroached upon their liberties, and made themselves Ty|rants.
Wherefore we are to consider what is said, with limitation and restraint; and respect
both the manner in which such power is confer'd, as likewise the time it is to continue, whe|ther
for longer or shorter: for an absolute power (though granted but for a year) is very
dangerous, and produces such effects as are sutable to the mind of the person to whom it is
granted. And the power of the Decem-viri (if examined) will be found much greater
than the power of the Dictators. For notwithstanding the creation of the Dictator, the
majesty of the Consuls and Senate remained, together with the authority of the Tribunes,
which were as bounds to restrain and circumscribe the jurisdiction of the Dictator; and
although the Dictator had power to remove any one out of the Consulship, or take from him
his Tribunitial authority; yet he could not vacat or abolish the whole Orders of Senators,
Consuls, and Tribunes, make new Laws, nor introduce a new form of Government. So
that their eyes being always upon him, he was forced (as it were) to intend only such
things as were for the benefit of the Commonwealth. But in the creation of the Decem-viri
it was otherwise; for the whole power of the people was transfer'd to them, the Con|suls
and Senate being cashiered, and the power of the Tribunes of the people almost quite
laid aside; so that standing alone in the Government, without Consuls, or Tribunes, or ap|peal
to the people, or any other Magistrate to correct or controul them; it was no strange
thing that the very next year after their creation, they should become intolerable and inso|lent,
especially being instigated by the ambition of Appius, And for this reason it is to be
observed, that when it is said, a Power conferred legally, and by the suffrage of the people,
is never prejudicial to the State; it is to be supposed to be confer'd with due circumstances,
and for a certain time; but when the people is cheated, and gives it imprudently and rashly,
as in this case of the Decem-viri, things never go better, which is easily proved by consider|ing
what it was that kept the Dictators so good, and made the Decem-viri so wicked: and
weighing withal the manner which other Republicks that were reputed well ordered,
observed, in conferring their authority for a long time, as the Spartans to their Kings, and
the Venetians to their Dukes: both of them prescribing them rules and limits that they
were not to exceed, and appointing such guards upon them as should be able (though they
were never so ill disposed of themselves) to keep them from employing their power to the
detriment of the State.
Nor is it sufficient if this Power be confer'd upon good men; for men are frail, and easily
corrupted, and then in a short time he that is absolute may easily corrupt the people, contract
friendships, make parties, heap up riches, and commit a thousand extravagancies; nor can

the poverty of their persons, or the want of relations prevent it, for wealth, and honour,
and every thing follows them which are absolute, as we shall show particularly when we
speak of the creation of the Decem-viri.


CHAP. XXXVI.
Citizens who have executed the greatest Offices, ought not afterwards.
to disdain or scruple the less.
MArcus Fabius and Cais Manlius being Consuls, the Romans obtained a glorious Vi|ctory
over the Veientes, and the Etrusci, in which was slain Quintus Fabius Brother
to the Consul, who was chosen the year before. From whence occasion is offered of ad|miring
the excellence of the Roman constitution; and observing how well it was accom|modated
for the enlargement of their Empire, from whose Model the more the Common|wealths
of our days do recede, the more do they wander and deviate from the best. For
though the Romans affected glory and command as much as other people, they did not
disdain notwithstanding to obey in their Armies, the same persons whom they had for|merly
commanded; and serve as private Soldiers, where they had formerly been Generals.
This is a practice contrary to the opinion and genius of our age so much, that in Venice it is
provided by a publick Law, that a Citizen who has had a greater command, may refuse to
accept of a less (and the City allows it) which Law though it may be convenient for pri|vate
persons, must needs be prejudicial to the publick; because the publick may with more
confidence commit an inferior command to a great Officer, than prefer an inferior Officer
to a great command: For to a young Soldier, those places of importance are not safely
entrusted, unless persons of experience and wisdom be placed about him, by whose Coun|sel
he may be directed: And if the Romans had done then, what the Venetians and other
Commonwealths do now, and not suffered any man who had ever been Consul, to serve
in any other quality, many things had befallen them that would have endangered their
liberty; and again, if any young Officers had been admitted to the supreme commands,
and no body placed about them to manage and direct them, they would have grown
dissolute and careless, and many things have hapned that might have ruined the
State.


CHAP. XXXVII.
What troubles and offence was created in Rome by the Agrarian Law; and
how dangerous it is to make a new Law opposite to an old Custom, with too
much retrospection.
IT is observed by most ancient Writers, that as men are afflicted in adversity, so they are
satiated in prosperity; and that joy and grief have the same effects: For when men are
not necessitated to fight, they fight for ambition, which is so powerful in our minds, that
let us arrive at what height of good fortune we can, we are never contented, but are still
labouring for more; and this happens to us, because we are naturally capable of desiring
many things, which we are unable to compass; and therefore our desire being greater than
our power to acquire, our minds are never at rest with what we enjoy. And this is the
occasion of all our varieties of fortune, for when we are always driving at more, and
fearful of losing what is already in our possession, we are apt to fall into suspicions, from
thence into quarrels, and from thence into Wars, which do usually bring after them the
ruine of our Country. This we have discoursed, to give you a better contemplation of the
People of Rome, which by a kind of necessity was forced by their Tribunitial power to
fortifie themselves against the oppressions of the Patricii; but when they had obtained
what indeed necessity impelled them to desire, being instigated by their ambition, they
went on further, and contended with the Patricii both for Honor, and Estate; which
was the occasion of the Seditions about the Agrarian Law, and by degrees the destruction
of the Common-wealth. And because it is necessary in every well order'd State, that
respect be had rather to the enrichment of the Publick, than particular Citizens, the
people of Rome could not (in what belong'd to this Law) but erre against the Funda|mentals

of their Government, if they were so constituted, that process of time could
give no occasion of difference, unless we will rather affirm that at first all things were so
well, that it was beyond the power of time to disorder them: Be it which way it will,
it is certain this Law was never mentioned in Rome, but with great controversie, and tu|mult.
This Law consisted principally in two heads. One was, That no Citizen of Rome
should be permitted to possess more than a certain proportion of Land. The other, that
what Land should be taken from the Enemy, should be divided equally among the people;
both of which Articles were against the interest of the Nobility; for most of them ha|ving
more Land than was allowed by this Law, their fortunes by it were to be confiscated,
and half of them taken away; and then by the distribution of what they should take from
the Enemy, they should lose all opportunity of enriching themselves for the future; which
being certainly true, and this Law so perfectly pernicious to the interest of the Nobility, it
was never mentioned by the Tribunes, but the Patricii opposed it, and with all the ea|gerness
imaginable; yet not always by force, but sometimes by evasion, either com|manding
out their Armies upon some pretended design, or by setting up another Tribune
in opposition to him who proposed the Law, that thereby they might dissolve it, or else
by sending new Colonies. And so it hapned when the Colony was sent to Antium at the
time when the difference was so high betwixt the Patricii and the Agrarians, that no other
expedient could be found to keep them from blood. Livy tells us, That there were very
few that would list themselves upon that accompt, to fill up the number of that Colony,
so much more did the people prefer an alotment about Rome, than in any other place. But
afterwards the quarrel grew higher, and to appease their Seditions, the Romans were
glad to send their Armies sometimes to the extreamest parts of Italy, and sometimes be|yond
them. But afterwards it falling out that the Lands which they took from the Ene|my
were remote, at great distance from Rome, and not to be cultivated with any conve|nience,
the people grew weary, and insisted not so fiercely on their Agrarian Law: They
began also to be more moderate in those kind of confiscations, but when any Country
was seized, they sent Colonies to plant them: With these Arts they skin'd over their
animosities till the time of the Gracchi, who reviving them again, gave occasion to the
ruine of their Government: for the Nobility having encreased their strength, the quarrel
advanced so far, that they came to blows, and the Magistrate being unable to restrain
them, th fury of the Faction encreasing, each party began to look out for a head. The
people chose Marius, and made him four times Consul, (with some little interval) which
authority he managed so well to his own advantage, that by the power and interest which
he had got in that time, he made himself thrice Consul afterwards. The Nobility having
no other remedy against so growing a Plague, applyed themselves to Sylla, and having
made him their chief, they fell to down right Wars, which were carried on with much
blood and variety of fortune, till at last the Nobility prevailed. The same faction re|vived
again in the days of Caesar and Pompey, and was attended by the destruction of the
State: For Caesar espousing the Marian party, and Pompey the Syllan; Caesar overcame,
and was the first that set up a Tyranny in Rome; after whose time that City could never
recover its liberty. This was the beginning, and this was the end of the Agrarian Law,
which may seem to contradict what we have said elsewhere. That the discords and enmity
betwixt the people and Senate of Rome conduced to the enlargement of their Empire, and
the conservation of their liberty, by giving opportunity for the making of such Laws, as
were great corroboration to their liberties and freedom; but I answer, That the effects
of the Agrarian Law, does not hinder, but that what we have said may be true; for so
great was the ambition of the Nobility, that had it not been curb'd and check'd several
ways, it would have usurped upon the City, and got the whole power into its hands.
And if we observe that the Agrarian dispute was three hundred years together in Rome,
before it could subvert it, we may easily imagine, the ambition of the Patricii would have
done it much sooner, had it not been ballanced and depressed by the people with their
Agrarian Laws, and some other inventions. From whence likewise we may observe that
wealth is more estimable among men, than honor; for when the Patricii were in contro|versie
with the people about Titles and Honor, they never went so high as to give them
any extraordinary disgust: But when their Estates and Fortunes were at stake, they
defended them with such zeal, that they chose rather to put the whole Commonwealth
into a flame, than to part with them quickly. The great authors of that Conflagration
were the Gracchi, whose good will and intentions towards the people, was much more
to be commended than their wisdom. For to remove an inveterated inconvenience, and
to that purpose to make a Law with too much retrospection, is ill Counsel (as I said
before) and hastens that ruine which it was designed to prevent; but with Patience and

Compliance, the mischief is either delayed, or spends it self in time, before it does any
great hurt.


CHAP. XXXVIII.
Weak Commonwealths are generally irresolute, and ill advised, taking
their measures more from Necessity, than Election.
THe Volsci, and the Equi understanding that Rome was sadly visited with a Contagion,
concluded it a fair opportunity to conquer it, and having betwixt them raised a
powerful Army, they invaded the Latini, and Hernici; over-ran most of their Country,
and forced them to send to Rome for assistance. The Romans returned answer, that they
should put themselves in Arms, and make as good defence as they could; for the Sickness
was so raging, they could give them no relief. which shows the generosity and wisdom
of that Senate, That in all conditions, and under the greatest of their Calamities never
receded from its Majesty and Grandeur; but at all times would have the disposal of the
affairs of its Subjects, and when necessity required, made no scruple to command things
contrary to their old ways of proceeding. This I say, because formerly the Senate
had forbidden them to arm, upon any occasion whatever; and perhaps another Council
would have thought it derogatory to their Grandeur, to permit them to defend them|selves:
But this Senate was endued with admirable prudence, understood how things were
to be taken, and rejected; and of two evils, how to make choice of the least. It troubled
them much that they were not in condition to protect them; and it troubled them no
less, That they would be forced to defend themselves, upon their own score without suc|cours
from Rome; yet finding there was a necessity of it, the enemy being at their Gates,
and threatning them with death, they retained their authority, and with great gravity
sent them word to defend themselves and raise what forces they could. This may seem
but a common resolution, and what any other Commonwealths would have taken as well
as that; but weak and ill ordered Commonwealths cannot come off with so much honour.
Duke Valentine having taken Faenza, and overrun most part of Bologna, demanded pas|sage
of the Florentines to march his Army to Rome. The Florentine Council met, and
consulted, and there was not one man who thought it convenient to grant it. This was
not according to the discretion of the Romans; for the Duke being very strong, and the
Florentines but weak, it had been more for their honour to have granted him passage, when
they could not obstruct it; that what they could not resist, might have been imputed
to their courtesie. But there is no remedy, 'tis the property of weak States to do
every thing amiss, and never to do well but in spight of their teeths, for there is no
such thing as prudence amongst them. And this Florence has verified in two other cases.
In the year 1500. when Lewis XII. had repossessed himself of Milan, he had an incli|nation
to restore Pisa to the Florentines upon the payment of 50000 Florens: To this
purpose he sent thither his Army under the Command of Mounsieur de Beaumont in whom
(though a French man) the Florentines had great confidence. Beaumont came up with
his Army betwixt Cassina and Pisa, and lodged it conveniently for the battering the Town:
having been two or three days before, it and all things ready for the assault, Commissio|ners
came out, and offered to surrender to the French, upon condition that he would en|gage
upon the honor of his Master that it should not in four months time be delivered to
the Florentine; to which the Florentines not consenting, the Commissioners returned.
The cause why the Florentines refused it, was their jealousie of the King, though they had
put themselves under his protection. They did not consider that the King could better
have put the Town into their hands when he was Master of it himself (and if he had
refused it, it would have discover'd him) than promise to do it when he was not in
possession, and yet they be forced to purchase that promise at a very great rate. Two
years after, Arezzo revolted, and the King sent Seigneur Iubalt with supplies to the
Florentines, who had besieged the Town. Iubalt was no sooner arrived, but the Inha|bitants
of Arezzo made him the same proffer, and the Florentines could not be brought
to consent: Iubalt resented it, and knowing it to be a great fault, he practised privately with
the Aretines, without Communicating with the Florentine Commissaries: An agreement
was clap'd up betwixt them, by virtue of which Iubalt entred the Town, and re|proached
the Florentines by their indiscretion, as people wholly inexperienced in the

affairs of the world. He told them, if they desired to have it, they should signifie it
to the King, who would be better able to gratifie them in the Town, than without.
The Florentines were highly offended, and spake very hardly of Iubalt, till they con|sidered
that of Beaumont had done the same at Pisa, they had both as well as one
I say therefore, that weak and irresolute States, do seldom take good Counsels, unless
they be forced; for their weakness suffers them not to deliberate, where any thing is
doubtful; and if that doubt be not removed by a violent necessity, they never come to a
resolution, but are always in suspence.


CHAP. XXXIX.
Divers People have many times the same Accidents.
WHoever compares past things with the present, will find that in all Ages
men have had the same humours and appetites as now. So that 'tis an
easie matter by consulting what is pass'd, not only (in all common-wealths) to see
what will follow, but to provide such remedies as their Predecessors did apply; or if
there be no Presidents, to invent new remedies according to the similitude of the acci|dents.
But because these considerations are neglected, History not read, or not under|stood
at least by him who governs, it comes to pass that all Ages have their miscarriages
and troubles. The City of Florence after the Government had stood 94 years, having lost
a good part of its Territory, as Pisa, and other Towns, was forced to make War upon
those who possessed them; and the Inhabitants being strong, and unwilling to restore
them, much was spent in the War; to very little purpose. Their great expence, occa|sioned
great Taxes, and their impositions upon the people, made them mutinous, and
unquiet. These affairs were administred by a Magistracy of ten Citizens, who were called
the Dieci della Guerra: The people began to repine and to complain that the said Counsel
was the cause of the War, and that they embezled their Money. That the best way would
be to remove them from that Office or when their time was expired to choose no more,
but let the Government fall back into its old channel again. These grave Persons who
had the superintendancy of the War, were no sooner discharged, but things grew worse
and worse, and instead of recovering Pisa, and the rest of the Towns in dispute, they lost
Arezzo, and several other places. The people finding their mistake, and that their ma|lady
was rather from the Feaver, than the Physitian, they restored the ten Commissaries,
which before they had cashier'd. The people of Rome had the same fancy against the
Consuls, and would not believe but they were the causes of all their distractions, and that
to settle all things, and preserve themselves in peace, the best way would be to remove
them entirely, and provide that there should never be any more, or else to restrain and
limit their authority in such manner, that they should have no power over them, either
within the City or without. They believed that all proceeded from the ambition of the
Nobility, who not being able to chastise the people in the City, because they were protected
by their Tribunes, contrived to carry them out of Town under the command of their
Consuls, to correct them where they should not be capable of any redress. The first man
who had the confidence to propose it, was Terentillus a Tribune, who moved that it might
be committed to five persons to consider the power of the Consuls, and to appoint limi|tations.
The Nobility opposed it, and (it is probable) employed all their interest against
it, for it was no less than to debase the Majesty of the Government, and leave themselves
no dignity in the commonwealth. Nevertheless the obstinacy of the Tribunes was such,
that the Name of Consul was laid aside, and after several experiments, the people chose
rather to create their Tribunes with Consular power, than to create new Consuls again,
showing thereby that their quarrel was not so much against the authority, as Name: But
they found their error at length, and restored their Consuls, as the Florentines did their
Council of ten.



CHAP. XL.
The creation of the Decem-virat in Rome; what things are most remarkable in
it; and how far such a Constitution may be useful or pernicious to a Common|wealth.
BEfore we discourse of the troubles and commotions which hapned in Rome by means
of the Decem-virat, it will not be amiss to give a short history of its Creation, in
which there are many things well worthy our remark, as well for the preservation as de|struction
of a State; and this discourse will remonstrate the errors both of the Senate and
People in prejudice to the liberty, and of Appius (chief of the Decem-viri) against that
tyranny which he design'd to erect. The Romans therefore after a long debate betwixt the
Nobility and People about the Constitution of such Laws as might settle and establish the
liberty of their State, by common consent, sent to Athens Spurius Posthumus, with two
other persons, for exemplifications of such Laws as Solon had made there, that thereby they
might model their own. As soon as they were returned they chose certain learned and
grave men to peruse the said Laws, and select such as they thought convenient for the Ro|mans.
The persons created for this office were ten of the principal Citizens (with Com|mission
for a year) among whom, Appius Claudius was one, a witty, but a turbulent man.
And that they might act freely, without any awe or impediment in their affairs, they laid
aside all the other Magistrates, (in particular the Tribunes and Consuls) and forbad all appeal
to the people; so that this Magistracy were compleat Soveraigns in Rome. Not long after
Appius assumed the whole authority of the ten, his Companions paying a reverence, as their
Superior, by reason of his interest with the people; for he had made himself so popular on
a sudden, it was almost a miracle to consider how soon his nature was changed, and he of
their only cruel and fierce adversary become their greatest Courtier and Favourite.
The first year all went very well, and he who presided marched only with twelve Li|ctors
before him; when any Citizen was to be tried for murder, they framed the Process,
but appointing a day, left it to be judged by the people, though their jurisdiction was So|veraign,
and without any appeal. They writ their Laws in ten Tables, but before they
were ratified they exposed them to the people that every man might see them at his plea|sure,
and approve or object as he saw occasion. When Appius perceived the end of his
Commission approaching, he caused it to be rumoured among the people, that to compleat
all, and give perfection to their designs, it would be convenient to add two Tables more to
their Ten, in order to which the common people consented that the Decem-virat should be
continued for a year; and they did it with the more readiness, that neither the Consuls
nor Tribunes might be restored, but Causes be left to their own judgment, as is said before. A
day being appointed for a new creation, 'tis not to be imagined how all the Nobility stickled,
and endeavoured to gain that honour which they had so stifly impugned by their applica|tions
to the people, whom they had so highly provoked. But among them all, none was
so solicitous for the continuation of the Decem-virat, as Appius Claudius who pressed it of
the people with so much instance and humanity, that he began to be suspected by his asso|ciates,
Credebant enim haud gratuitam in tanta superbia Comitatem fore; They could not
imagine a person of his pride would stoop to such flatterry without some great design: that they
might defeat neatly, and with cunning, what they could not do by force; though he was
the youngest of them all, they committed the nomination of the next ten to him, suppo|sing
he would have observed ancient rules, and not named himself, which was a practice of
no use nor reputation in Rome, Ille verb impedimentum, pro occasione arripuit he spoil'd
their Plot made advantage of their impediment, and named himself among the foremost, to
the amazement and displeasure of all the Nobility.
This Creation was no sooner over, but both Nobility and People began to be sensible of
their error; for, as was said of him, Finem fecit ferendae alienae personae, Appius began to
shew himself, and lay aside the disguise he had put on: he began to act according to his own
natural pride, and in a little time had made his Collegues as bad as himself. To terrifie the
Senate and people both, the first day of their Magistracy they multiplied their Lictors to 120,
whereas formerly they had but 12, which were carried before every one of them by turns,
but now every one of them had as many. This terror for some time was equally diffused,
but afterwards they began to favour the Nobility, and insult upon the people only; and if
any of the people that had been injured by any of the Decem-viri, and had no right done
him by the first, to whom he addressed, if he appeal'd to another, he was sure to be worse;

insomuch as the people finding their error, began in their affliction to look upon the No|bility;
Et inde libertatis captari auram, unde servitutem timendo, in eum statum rempub|licam
adduxerant; and from thence hope for their liberty, from where their apprehension of
servitude had brought their Commonwealth into the condition in which it was.
And this affliction in the people was no little satisfaction to the Nobility, Ut ipsi taedio
praesentium, Consules desiderarent; that the tediousness of their sufferings might make them
restore their Consuls. By this time their years was expired, and the two Tables to be added
to the ten, both ready, and wanted nothing but publication; the Decem-viri had no mind to
lay down, but began to think of continuing their authority by force, to which end they
raised themselves Guards out of the young Nobility, and paid them out of the Estates of
those who were condemned. Quibus donis juventus corrumpebatur,  malebat licentiam su|am,
quam omnium libertatem; by which preferment the youth were debauched, and chose rather
to be licentious themselves than that their Country should be free.
Whilst things were in this posture, the Sabini and the Volsci made War upon the Romans
and invaded them with a great Army. The Romans were in great consternation and the
Decem-viri began to find the weakness of their Government, for without a Senate they
were at a loss to manage their War; and with it their authority would be supplanted. But
being necessitated at last, they came to a resolution, and resembled the Senate. Many
speeches were made against the Decem-viri, in particular by Valerius and Horatius; and
doubtless their authority had been utterly exploded, but that the Senate; in spight to the
people, chose rather to continue them, lest, if they were deposed, the people should set up
their Tribunes, and the Consuls be quite laid aside; whereas, if afterwards the Decem-viri
could be brought fairly to lay down, by degrees the Consuls might be restored, and the Tri|bunes
be cashiered. Hereupon the Senate silently, without further prosecution of them,
prepared for the War, and sent forth two Armies under the Command of several of the
Ten, but Appius Claudius was left behind for the Government of the City. Whilst his
Collegues were abroad, it was his fortune to fall in love with a Plebeian's daughter called
Virginia, and not being able to persuade, he would take her away by force; Virginius the
Father of the Virgin was willing to defend the chastity of his Daughter, and knowing no
other way to secure it, he got Appius to be imprisoned: whereupon great tumults suc|ceeding
in Rome, and in the Army, the Souldiers returned, and joyning with the people
they encamped upon the holy Mountain, where they resolved to continue till the Ten had
resigned, Tribunes and Consuls were restored, and the Commonwealth had recovered its
old liberty and freedom. This is the story of the Decem-virat, as shortly related as could
be, in which it may be observed, that the people of Rome fell into subjection and servitude
upon the same causes as other Commonwealths very frequently do; that is, by the too
great desire of the people to be free, and the too great ambition in the Nobility of Com|mand:
when these two Factions cannot agree, they are forced to refer all to some third
person in whom they confide; and then begins the Tyranny. The Decem-virat was ere|cted
in Rome by consent both of the Nobility and People, and invested with so much pow|er,
out of a hatred which the Nobility bare to the Tribunitial, and the people to the Con|sular
authority: as soon as the Decem-viri were chosen, Appius pretended highly for the
people, and promised to be their Champion, whereupon they favoured him exceedingly.
And (be it in what City it will) whenever the people are brought to extol and applaud
a person, for no other reason, but because it is in his power to punish their enemies; if that
person be cunning and industrious, their liberty is lost, and he can usurp when he pleases;
for by the assistance of the people he may master the Nobility; and when they are down,
it will be no hard matter to subdue the people, who will have no body to fly to, nor no body
to support them: but before the Nobility be suppressed, he is by no means to meddle with
the people. And this has been the method of all those who have laid the foundation of
Tyranny in any Commonwealth; which if Appius had followed, he had not lost his ill|got
authority so soon: but he went quite contrary, and with as much imprudence as was
possible, ran himself into the displeasure of the same persons which advanced him; and
ingratiated with those who were against his preferment, and were no way able to sustain
him, whereby he lost his old friends who were powerful, and endeavoured to get new that
could do him no good. For though the Nobility have naturally no aversion to Tyranny; yet
that part of the Nobility which shares not in the profits is always an enemy to the Ty|rant,
and their ambition and avarice is so great, all the riches and honours in the Tyrants
disposal are too little to take them off. Hence it is that the aggressor in any enterprize
is of necessity to be stronger than his adversary; and he who in the establishment of a Ty|ranny
makes the people rather than the Nobility his friends, will be stronger and more se|cure
than he who goes the other way, cajoles with the Nobility, and disobliges the People:

for the people being always stronger in the City, by their friendship, a Tyrant may subsist
without any foreign supplies. This was visible in the case of Nabis the Tyrant of Sparta,
who having the affections of the people, and secured himself of some of the Nobility,
defended himself against all Greece, and the whole power of the Romans, which without
the hearts of the people he could never have done. But he who makes his interest with
the Nobility, cannot maintain himself without foreign assistance; for he will want Guards
for th security of his person, Souldiers to do the Office of the Militia in the Country, and
Confederates and Allies to succour him in his distress; whereas if he could be supplyed in
these three defects, it might be possible for him to subsist without the friendship of
the people. But Appius failing in these, miscarried in the very beginning of his Ty|ranny.
In the creation of the Decem-virat the Senate and the People were guilty of very great
error; for though in our discourse of Dictators we have said before, that those Magistrates
only are pernitious to the publick liberty, who set up themselves by force, not they who are
legally chosen and by the suffrage of the people; yet the people are to take special care in
the election of their Magistrates, that they may not easily usurp. But the Romans instead
of placing Guards about their Decem-viri that might have kept them in order, they not
only took their Guards away, but displaced all the rest of their Magistrates, and made them
absolute for that year, and all out of a design to countermine one another; the Nobility
to suppress the Tribunes, and the people the Consuls. So that it hapned to them, as Fer|dinand
King of Arragon was wont to say it hapned to men that hated one another; that
is, that they acted like birds of prey, all of them pursuing the quarry with equal rapacity;
but the little birds not regarding the greater over their heads, are easily interrupted, and
made prey themselves. But we have said enough to demonstrate the ill Counsel of the
Romans in thinking to preserve their liberty by the creation of the Decem-virat, and the
errors of Appius in driving at the Soveraignty, and miscarrying so soon.


CHAP. XLI.
For a mean man to grow immediately insolent, or a meek man immediately cruel,
without just steps of gradation, is both imprudent and unprofitable.
AMong the rest of Appius his faults in the management of his Tyranny, it was of no
little ill consequence that he changed his humour so suddenly: his cunning in cajoling
the people, and pretending to be of their party, was good: his invention to renew the
creation of the Ten was no worse; his boldness in presenting himself contrary to the ex|pectation
of the Nobility was well enough, and his creating Collegues for his turn was
not amiss. But having gone thus far, (as is said before) to change his nature in a moment;
of a friend, to become an enemy to the people; of an humble and affable man, to shew
himself proud; of a mild man, to become difficult and perverse; and all this with so little
circumstance, that the whole World might see it was either the falsness or levity of his tem|per,
was high indiscretion: for he that has ever pretended to be good, and is willing for
his advantage to become otherwise, must not do it at a leap, but by degrees, and upon oc|casion,
that before the diversity of his deportment deprives him of his old friends, he may
have gained himself new, without diminution to his authority; otherwise being discovered
and deserted, he is certainly ruined.


CHAP. XLII.
How easily mens manners are corrupted.
IT is remarkable likewise in the passages of the Decem-viri, that men are easily corrupted,
and become wicked, be their education never so good. The youth which Appius de|bauched,
and took for his Guards, is sufficient to prove it; who, though of honourable ex|traction,
and brought up with all possible advantage, suffered themselves to be corrupted by
their preferments, became favourers of tyranny, and perfer'd their own licentiousness be|fore
the liberty of their Country. Quintus Fabius did the same, who, though an excellent
person at first, and one of the Decem-viri of the second creation, blinded with ambition

and enveigled by the cunning of Appius, changed his good humour into bad, and grew as
intolerable as he; which things, if seriously considered, should make all Legislators (either
in Commonwealths or Kingdom) the more careful and diligent to restrain the ambition
of mankind, and take from them all hopes of impunity when they offend in that
kind.


CHAP. XLIII.
Those Souldiers which fight for their own honour are the best, and most
to be trusted
FRom the same History it may be observed how much it imports the prosperity or adver|sity
of affairs to have the minds of the Souldiers quiet, and ready to engage upon a prin|ciple
of honour, rather than to have them turbulent, and disposed to fight upon every mans
ambition: for whereas the Roman Armies were always Victorious under the conduct of
the Consuls; under the Decem-viri they were always unfortunate: from hence likewise it
may be collected how unsafe it is to commit the defence of our affairs to a mercenary Army
who have nothing to encourage or oblige them but their pitiful pay, which is not con|siderable
enough to make them so faithful as to lay down their lives in your quarrel, For
in an Army where the Souldier is not bound to the person for whom he fights by some par|ticular
obligation, or the expectation, of more than ordinary advantage by the Victory if
the enemy be strong, they will make but little resistance; and this kindness and affection
of the Souldiers to the General cannot be but where they are subjects fighting under a
good Prince or a lawful Magistrate in defence of their Posterity and Religion: so that it is
necessary for every King or Commonwealth who desires to defend himself well, to train
up his own Subjects in Military Discipline, that he may safely depend upon them in time of
distress; and it has been the practice of all those who have done any great things. The
Roman Armies under the Decem-viri had doubtless the same courage as under the Con|suls:
but not being so well affected towards the one as the other, they would not put it
forth, nor give such testimonies as formerly: but when the tyranny of the Decem-virat ex|tinguished,
and their liberty was recovered, having then the same tenderness and affection
to their Country, they fought as well as before, and their enterprizes had the same happy
success.


CHAP. XLIV.
A multitude without an head is altogether unserviceable; nor is any man to
threaten that has any thing to desire.
UPon the accident of Virginius, the people having taken Arms, and retir'd to the holy-Mount,
the Senate sent to them to know upon what account they had abandoned
their Officers, and betaken themselves to that Mount: and the authority of the Senate was
so venerable among the people, that having no head among them, there was no body durst
return an answer: Titus Livius tells us, Non defuit quid responderetur, deerat qui responsum
daret; They wanted not what to say, but who to deliver it. For having no certain Comman|der,
every private person was unwilling to expose himself to their displeasure. From
whence we may understand how useless a thing the multitude is without a head, which be|ing
observed by Virginius, he caused twenty Military Tribunes to be made, with power
to treat and expostulate with the Senate instead of a Head.
The people insisting to have Valerius and Horatius sent to them, to whom they would
communicate their grievances, Valerius and Horatius refused to go till the Decemviri had
laid down their authority; which being at length obtained with much concertation; Va|lerius
and Horatius repaired to the people, and understood that they would have new Tri|bunes
to be chosen; they would have appeals from every Magistrate to the people; and
they would have the Decem-viri to be delivered up into their hands, that they might burn
them alive: the Embassadors liked the first of their demands, but refused to consent to the
last as impious, telling them, Crudelitatem damnatis, in crudelitatem ruitis: You condemn
cruelty, and practise it your selves: and before you will be free, you will tyrannize over your

adversaries; advising them to lay that Article by, and mention the Decemviri no farther,
but to address themselves to the reassumption of their power and authority, after which
they would not want ways of receiving satisfaction; for then every man's life and fortune
would be at their disposing. Hence we may learn how weak and imprudent it is to desire a
thing, and before we receive it, declare to what ill use we intend it, especially if we mean
to do mischief, 'tis just as you should say, pray give me your Sword, that I may run
you thorow, 'Tis sufficient to borrow the Sword, and when you have it, you may do
as you please.


CHAP. XLV.
'Tis a thing of ill Example to break a new Law, especially for the Maker:
and 'tis no less dangerous to the Governor of a State, to multiply injuries,
and repeat them every day.
THe Commotions about the Tyranny of the Decem-viri being composed, and Rome
restored to its old form of Government again; Virginius cited Appius before the
the people to answer what he had attempted upon his Daughter. Appius appeared with
his Nobility about him; Virginius commanded him to Prison: Appius cryed out, he
appealed to the people: Virginius replyed, That he who had taken away those appeals
from the people, ought not to have any benefit by them, nor be permitted to implore their
protection, whose Laws and Liberties could receive no protection from him. Appius
insisted, that they ought not to violate a thing which they had urged with that eagerness,
and ordained with that zeal. And though indeed the life of Appius was wicked enough,
and there was no punishment that he did not deserve; yet it was inhospitable and contrary
to all civil Society, to violate their own Laws, which were but newly made, and passed
with so much importunity: for in my judgment there is nothing so indecorous, nor
of so ill example in a Commonwealth, as the infraction of a new Law, by the Le|gislator
himself.
When in the year 1494. the State of Florence was restored by the assistance of a Frier
called Hieronimo Savonarolo (whose writings give sufficient testimony of his Learning
and integrity) having among other things for the security of the Citizens, obtained a Law
for appeals to the people in matters of State, both from the Senate and the Council of Eight
(which Law he had a long time solicited, and got with much difficulty at last) It hapned
that not long after, there were five persons condemned to death by the Senate, which
persons endeavouring very earnestly to appeal to the people, they were denyed that liber|ty,
and could not have the benefit of that Law; which was greater diminution to the
reputation of the Frier, than any thing that had ever hapned before: For if that Law was
of such importance as he had pretended, it ought to have been observed; if nor, why
was it solicited so earnestly? And it was the more remarkable in the Frier, because in his
many Sermons and Discourses afterwards to the people, he neither blamed the breaking of
that Law, nor went about to excuse it, for being to his purpose, he would not condemn
it, and excuse it he could not, having nothing to say; which action having discovered the
ambition and partiality of his mind, took much off from his repute, and loaded him with
scandal. It is of great inconvenience likewise in a State, to revive, and ferment the hu|mours
in the minds of the Citizens, by a daily renovation of their injuries upon one per|son
or other, as it hapned in Rome after the Decem-virat, was dissolved, and the Tribuni|tial
authority re-established by the people: For all the Decem-viri, and several other
considerable Citizens were Accused, and Condemned, in so much as there was a
General consternation among the Nobility, who thought there would be no end of their
condemnation, till they were utterly extinct: Which proceeding and apprehension, would
doubtless have produced great troubles in the State, had not they been prevented by Marcus
Duellius the Tribune, who published an Edict, That for a twelve-month it should not be
lawful either to cite or accuse any man that was Citizen of Rome; by which act of Mode|ration,
he secured the Nobility. From whence we may discern how unsafe it is for any
Prince or Commonwealth to keep the minds of their Subjects in perpetual fear and sus|pence;
and without doubt nothing can be more pernicious; for men being insecure, and
jealous of being questioned for some Capital offence, will look out for protection, and
not only so, but are provoked to more boldness, and become less scrupulous of doing great
mischiefs. If therefore such Commotions happen, it is better if possible to compose them

without blood, but if Example must be made, it is to be done at once, that afterwards the
people may be reassured, and recover their old security, and tranquility of mind.


CHAP. XLVI.
How men leap from one passion to another, and how they who at first aim at
nothing but self-preservation, when secured of that, grow oppressors of other
People.
AFter the people of Rome had recovered their liberty, and had by so much impro|ved
their former condition, by how much they had made many new Laws to for|tifie
their power, one would have expected they should have been quiet, and after so much
trouble and embroilment, enjoyed some time of repose; but it fell out quite contrary,
they were more perplexed than before, every day producing some new Sedition or Di|sturbance:
Of which, Livy giving the reasons so clearly, I do not think it amiss to in|sert
them in this place. These two Orders (says he) were in perpetual opposition; when
the people were humble, the Nobility was proud, when the populace was quiet, and
content with their bounds, the young Nobility took their time to be insolent; and when
the Tribunes interposed in their behalf, they made little progress at first, and at length
were as much injur'd themselves. The graver sort of the Nobility on the other side,
though they thought their own youth to be too furious and insolent, yet they had rather
if one side must transgress, that it should be their own, than the peoples: So that their
immoderate desire of preserving their priviledge, was the cause that when either party
was prevalent, it employed its whole power in oppressing the other. It is common among
men, when they would secure themselves, to injure other people; they begin first to do
mischief, to revile, or to beat, or what other outrage they are able, as if the injury they
would avoid themselves, was to be thrown upon their Neighbour, and there was no Me|dium
betwixt doing, and suffering of wrong. From hence we may see after what man|ner
(among other things) Commonwealths are dissolved, and how suddenly men pass
from one ambition to another, according to that true saying which Salust put into the
mouth of Caesar. Omnia mala exempla, bonis initiis Orta sunt. All disorders and abuses,
are good in their beginnings. The first thing an ambitious Citizen endeavours, is so to
fortifie, that he may defend himself not only against his private adversary, but against
the publick Magistrate, if at any time he would offend him; to which end he makes what
friends he can, by furnishing them with Mony or supporting them against their Oppres|sors;
and this seeming very honest in appearance, people are easily deluded, and no body
goes about to prevent it; so that no obstacle being given, he grows insensibly so great, that
not only the private Citizens, but the Magistrate begins to apprehend him; and then
there is no resisting him without manifest danger, for the reasons (which I have mention'd
before) of the dangerous contending with inconvenience that has got that growth and
maturity in a City. What is then to be done? Let him alone in his prosperity, and he
enslaves you for ever, unless death or some other kind accident delivers you: If you think
to remove him on a sudden, you do but add to his power and hasten your own ruine; for
finding himself in such a posture that his Friends, his Enemies, the Magistrates, and all
people are afraid of him, he will then begin to domineer, and dispose of all things ac|cording
to his own judgment and pleasure; If there be any way to prevent it, it is by
watching in time, by having a diligent eye over your Citizens, that under colour of doing
good, they may not be able to do mischief; and that they may have as much reputation
as may serve, not ruine their liberty: but of this more hereafter.



CHAP. XLVII.
Though the people, in things that are discours'd in general, are many times
mistaken, yet when they are reduced to particulars, they are more sensible
and judicious.
THe Name of consul (as we said before) being grown odious to the people of Rome
they resolved to have them created for the future out of the Populace; or else to
limit and circumscribe their authority with such rulers as they should think fit. The
Nobility, to prevent both inconveniences, took a way betwixt both, and was contented
that they should create four Tribunes with consular authority, to be chosen indifferently
out of the people, and Senate. The people were well enough satisfied, as thinking by
that means the Consulship would extinguish, and that they should have a share of the
supream dignity themselves. But observe what followed when they came to the creation
of their Tribunes, and it was not only in their power, but expected, that they should
have been all made out of the people, they chose them all out of the Nobility, which gave
occasion to Livy to say, Quorum Comitiorum eventus docuit, alios animos in Contentione
libertatis  honoris, alios secundum deposita Certamina in incorrupto judicio esse. The
success of that Election did show, That when their honour and liberty were in controversie,
the people were of one mind; when they were secure and free, they were of another. Con|sidering
with my self what might be the reason, I suppose it is because men are more apt
to be mistaken in generals, than in particulars. The people thought themselves more
worthy of the Cousulship than the Nobility, because they had the greatest interest in the
City; They underwent the greatest difficulty in the Wars, and it was their Arms which
defended its liberty, and propagated the Empire of Rome: according to which argument,
their desires seeming but reasonable, they resolved they would have them in spight of all
opposition: But when they came to particulars, and to examine their own private Ca|pacities
for Government, they found themselves so weak and defective, that though alto|gether
they thought themselves able enough, yet they could not find one man they judged
proper for the employment; ashamed therefore of their incapacity, they gave their voices
for such as they found were more really worthy; which Titus Livius admiring, has these
words, Hanc modestiam, aequitatem  altitudinem animi ubi nunc in uno inveneris, quae
tunc populi universi fuit? Where will you find now-a-days, that Modesty, that Equity, that
Magnanimity in one man, that was then obvious in the whole body of the people? To the
same purpose there hapned another notable Example in Capua, after Hanibal had defeated
the Romans at the Battel of Cannas. After that defeat, the Inhabitants of Capua began to
mutiny against the Government (as indeed all Italy did at that time) the grounds of
their discontent, was an old pique betwixt the people and Senate, which the first thought
then to improve to the destruction of the other. Pacuvius Calanus being a very wise
man, and at the Helm at that time, considering with himself of what dangerous conse|quence
a tumult might prove in so populous a City, resolved to find out some way to
accommodate their difference. To this end, he assembled the Senate, and in few words
remonstrated to them the implacable hatred which the people had to them; That they
were in great danger of being murthered by them, and the City delivered up to Hanibal,
by reason that the condition of Rome was become so deplorable; and at length he con|cluded,
that if they would commit the whole matter to him, he would find out an expe|dient
to unite them, and his expedient was to lock up the Senate in the Palace, and by
putting them into the peoples power, to preserve them. The Senate submitted, were
lock'd up in the Castle, and having assembled the people, he told them, That the hour was
now come for redeeming their liberty, and chastising the insolence of their Nobility, who
had so often abused them. He told them he had them all lock'd up in his Custody, to be
disposed of as they pleased; but because he could not think it was their desire to leave the
City without a Government, before they proceeded to the execution of the ancient Sena|tors,
it would be necessary, as he conceived, to think of creating a new one; to that
purpose he had brought the Names of the old Senators in a Purse, would draw them out
one by one, and as they resolved upon another to succeed in each place, he would see the
old one delivered out to execution. The people were content, and Pacuvius drew one,
and nam'd him aloud, upon which a great noise was raised, some said he was cruel, others
he was proud, and others that he was arrogant: Then says Pacuvius, he is unfit to be
continued, pray will you make choice of another in his stead. Silence was commanded,
and one of the people was named; He was named no sooner, but some began to hum,

others to laugh, and all to revile, and so proceeding from one to another, they were all
concluded unfit for so honourable a degree. Paccucius taking the occasion, told them, since
you are sensible it is unfit that the City should be without a Senate; and since you cannot
agree about the Election of a new; it would be expedient in my judgment, that you pro|pose
some way of reconciliation; for doubtless the fear in which the Senators have been,
must of necessity have so humbled them, that that gentleness and humanity which you have
sought for elsewhere, may now be found in them. The people began then to discover in
particular, the fault which they had committed in judging in general, and declared they
were ready for any reasonable reconciliation. And in this manner it is that most people
deceive themselves in judging generally of things and their accidents, which upon parti|cular
examination they do easily discover.
After the year 1414. the chief of the Florentines being driven out of the City, it was
left wholly without order or government, over-whelm'd with licentiousness and ambition,
and the interest of the publick running headlong to ruine. Many of the popular party
foreseeing the inevitable destruction of the City, and not knowing to what else to impute
it, they charged it upon the ambition of some persons among the Nobility, which (as
they pretended) formented their disorders, to take away their liberty, and model the State
according to their own fancies, and designs. And these Mutineers were in all places; in
the Streets, in the Houses, in the palaces, declaring publickly, and threatning that if ever
they came to the government, they would look farther into the business, and punish all
those which they should find conscious of it. It hapned afterwards that some of these
Citizens were advanced as they desired; but when they were at that height, and saw things
nearer than before, they became sensible of their error, and found that it was not the am|bition
of the Nobility, but the malignity of the times, which was the occasion of all
their trouble and commotion; so as they became new men, and exercised a new way of
administration; Insomuch that those who had heard them complain and threaten when
they were in private capacity, seeing them now at the helm, and performing nothing that
they had promised, did not look upon it as conviction of their judgment, so much as
corruption of their minds. Which thing being frequent among them, gave occasion to
the Proverb, Costoro hanno un animo in Piazza, et uno in Palazzo. They are of one mind
in the Town, and another in the Throne. Thus, by serious consideration of what has been
said we may see how to open the eyes of the people, and reduce them to a sence of their
errors, if we take them from their general and abstracted notions, and fix them upon par|ticulars,
as in the case of Paccucius in Capua, and the Senate in Rome. Again, I am of
opinion that no wise man is to decline the judgment of the people in the distribution
of Offices and Honours, and such particular affairs; for in those things they are almost
infallible, and when they do mistake, it is rather to be attributed to the obstinacy of some
few, to whom that business is referred, than to the ignorance of the whole body; which
being certainly so, I think it not superfluous to shew in my next Chapter the Order which
the Senate observed to over-reach the people in those kinds of distributions.


CHAP. XLVIII.
To prevent the advancement of mean people to the Magistracy, it is particularly
to be contrived that the competition be, betwixt the best and most Noble,
and the wickedest and most abject.
WHen the Senate began to apprehend, that the Tribunes wnuld be chosen out of the
people, and invested with Consular power; they had two ways, one of which
they constantly made use of. They put the best and most honorable persons to stand, or
else by their Mony they foisted in some sordid and ignoble Plebeian, among those of the
better sort which pretended to the Magistracy, and demanded it for him: The last way
made the people ashamed to confer it: the first made them ashamed to remove it; which
reinforces what I have said so often before, that though in generals the people may be mi|staken,
in particulars they are provident enough.



CHAP. XLIX.
If those Cities which have been free from their foundation (as Rome) have
found it difficult to contrive such Laws as might maintain them so. Those
which have been always servile, will find it almost impossible.
THe Government of Rome, and its affairs abroad and at home, do sufficiently show how
hard it is to establish such Laws in a Commonwealth as my preserve it always in a
good and quiet Estate. It had first Romulus, then Numa, Tullus Hostilius, Servius, and
others, who employed their industry and capacity to regulate it well, and prescribe good
Laws; after which, ten Citizens were created on purpose, and yet new difficulties arose
every day, which required new remedies: One of their great expedients (which indeed
contributed much to the incorruption of that City) was the creation of the Censors, to
correct the exorbitances, splendor, and ill husbandry of the Citizens; and although in the
beginning it was with some inconsideration decreed that those Officers should be created
for five years, yet by the prudence of Mamercus the Dictator, that error was afterwards re|ctifyed,
and the time of their continuance reduced to 18 months, which disgusted the then
Censors so highly, that they found means to turn Mamercus out of the Senate, to the
great regret, both of the Senators and people. And because the History does not show
how Mamercus defended himself, it must needs be the neglect of the Historian, or the
defect of the Laws; for it is not to be thought that in a perfect Commonwealth, a Citi|zen
should be so ill treated for promuging a Law so much for the security of their liberty,
and his innocence left without sanctuary or protection. But to return to my design, I say,
it is not to be admired if Cities conceived, and born, and brought up all along in servitude,
find so much difficulty to regulate, and preserve themselves in tranquility and peace (as
was to be seen in Florence) when Rome and other States (which have been free from the
beginning) have scarce been able to do it. Florence was in Subjection to the Roman Em|pire,
and governed by other people, so long that it had searce any hopes of ever being free.
Afterwards having time to breath, it began to look up, and make Laws for it self, but
mingling them with their old Laws, which were bad, they did them no good. For two
hundred years together their Government was in this manner, so that it was scarce wor|thy
the name of a Commonwealth. And the same inconveniencies have been incident to
all Cities whose beginnings have been servile like that. And though the Florentines did
many times by publick and free suffrage transfer an Authority upon a few of their princi|pal
Citizens, to examine and reform all things; yet those few regarded not so much the
common enterest and liberty, as their own private design and advantage in the whole man|ner
of their proceedings; which was so far from producing any order or settlement as
was intended, that it augmented the disorder, and made things worse than before. To
pass by other things which are likewise to be observed, I say that in every Commonwealth
it is particularly to be considered in whose hands the Cognizance of Capital offences is
placed, and who has the execution of the Sanguinary Laws: This was well ordered in
Rome, an appeal lying to the people from all the courts and Magistrates of the City;
and if at any time by that appeal, the delay of execution became dangerous to the State,
they had recourse to the Dictator, who commanded execution immediately; but they never
made use of their refuge, but in extream necessity.
But Florence, and other Cities born in servitude and Subjection, had not the benefit of
such an Officer, but were governed by strangers upon whom the Prince had transferred his
Authority; which Custom they kept up, after they had made themselves free, and con|tinued
the same Authority in a Foreigner, whom they called their Captain, which was a
dangerous thing, considering how easily he might be corrupted by the better sort of the
Citizens: Afterwards the Custom changed with the revolutions of State; and eight
Citizens were created to do the Office of the Captain, which alteration proved much for the
worse, for (as I said before) a few men prefer'd to the government, are always liable to
be caressed and cajoled by the Nobility, to the prejudice of the people. Against which
inconvenience, Venice provided very well, where there is a Council of Ten, which can
punish any Citizen whatever without any appeal; yet for fear they should not be sufficient
(though they have authority enough) for the punishment of persons of more than ordi|nary
quality, they have constituted the Quarantie to assist them, and the Council of Pregui
besides, which is the highest Council of that City; so that if any man will accuse, there are
judges enough ready to hear him. If therefore in Rome which was originally free, and

model'd and govern'd by the Counsels of so many wise men, new faults were daily disco|vered,
and fresh occasions for new Laws, to be made for the preservation of their liberty;
it is not to be admir'd, if in other Cities it was worse, where their Original was not so free,
nor so many wise men to model, and instruct them.


CHAP. L.
No Magistrate or Council ought to have power to check or controul the
publick acts of the City.
TItus Quintius Cincimatus, and Cneus Iulius Mentus being Consuls together in Rome,
but at perpetual odds, the affairs of that State was at a stand, their Laws were not
executed, their Wars were not prosecuted, nor any thing managed as it should be. The
Senate observing it, persuaded them to make a Dictator, by whom the State might be
reformed, and their differences composed, which had hitherto hindered the reformation:
But the Consuls, how contrary so ever in other things, consented not to do it, the Senate
having no other remedy, addressed to the Tribunes, who by the Authority of the Senate
required, and compelled the Consuls to the Creation of a Dictator: In which place it is
remarkable how beneficial the assistance of the Tribunitial power was, not only to defend
the people against the insolence of the Nobility, but to controul and restrain the emulation
and difference among themselves. And here it is carefully to be provided in the settlement
of a Commonwealth, that it be not in the power of a few persons to whom the Govern|ment
is entrusted, to quash or obstruct any Customs or Acts that are necessary to its subsi|stance:
For Example, If you authorize a Council, or any other persons to distribute
Honours, dispose of Offices, or execute any other of your commands, you must either lay
a strict injunction or necessity upon them to do as you appoint, or provide, so that if it be
neglected by them, it may be done by some body else; otherwise things are ill managed,
and the order is defective, as is manifest by that example in Rome, it the perversness of
the Consuls had not been opposed by the Authority of the Tribunes. In the Republick of
Venice, the grand Council (or Senate) has the distribution of Honours, and the Election
of Magistrates, both abroad and at home; and it hapning one time, that the Senate either
upon some disgust, or false suggestion omitted to creat Successors to the Magistrates at
home, or to their Officers abroad, there followed great disorders immediately; the Ter|ritory
and City wanting their lawful judges, could have no justice in any thing, till the
Senate was appeased. And this inconvenience would in time have brought the City into an
ill condition, had it not been prevented by the wisdom of some Citizens, who taking the
opportunity obtained a Law, That there should be no vacancy of Offices, either within the
City or without, but the old Offices should be continued till their Successors were chosen,
by which Law they deprived that great Council of a power to interrupt the course of Ju|stice,
which could not have been suffered without hazard to the State


CHAP. LI.
A Prince or Commonwealth that is constrained to do a thing, is to seem to do
it frankly, and without any compulsion.
A Wise man orders his affairs so, that whatever he does, seems rather voluntary and
gracious, than done by force and compulsion, be his necessity of doing it never so
great, which point of wisdom being well observed by the Romans, got them great reputa|tion
among the people, especially when they decreed stipends to the Soldiers out of the
publick Treasury, who before were obliged to serve at their own proper charges; for seeing
their Wars were like to be tedious, and their Armies to be carried into far Countries, before
they could be finished, they found neither the first could be continued, nor the latter per|form'd
but at the publick expence, wherefore the Senate was forced and necessitated to
pay the Soldiers out of the publick stock; yet they did it so slyly, and with that artifice,
that though compelled by necessity, it was received as a grace, and gain'd them exceed|ingly
the affections of the people, who had never so much as mention'd it by their Tri|bunes,
or thought of it themselves: So that never any thing was received with more

demonstration of joy. But the Tribunes were not so well satisfied, but endeavoured to
possess the people that it was not an act of that grace as they imagined; and that if they
looked closely into it, it would appear rather a grievance, than a benevolence; for how
was this Mony to be rais'd, but by Taxes and Impositions upon the people? so that if the
Senators were bountiful, it was out of other mens purses. But all would not do, let the
Tribunes say as they pleased, the people believed themselves highly obliged; and then the
manner of raising the Mony made it much the more grateful, for it was done with more
than ordinary equity, the greatest part of it being levyed upon the greatest men, and the
poor favoured as much as was possible.


CHAP. LII.
The best and most secure way to repress the insolence of an ambitious and power|ful
State, is to preclude and stop up those ways by which he would come to his
greatness.
BY what has been said before, it appears what affection the Senate conciliated among the
people, not only by the frankness of their bounty, but by their kindness in collecting
it; which order, if continued to the people, would have prevented all the tumults which
hapned afterward in that City, and deprived the Tribunes of their great credit and autho|rity.
And indeed there is not a better or more secure way to suppress the insolence, or
cross-bite the designs of an ambitious Citizen, than to take the same ways to prevent, which
he takes to advance them; which course, if it had been followed by the adversaries of Co|simo
de Medici would have been much more for their advantage than to have forced him
out of the Town. For had they applyed themselves to caressing and insinuating with the
people, (which was the way he took to fortifie himself) they had disarm'd him without
any tumult or violence, and taken from him the only arms upon which he depended for
his defence. About the same time Piero Soderini by his extraordinary beneficence got him
self a great interest and reputation among the people, and was publickly esteemed the great
Champion and Protector of their liberties: and doubtless his adversaries, who began to
grow jealous of his greatness, had done much more wisely, and honourably, and safely, to
have gone the same way to work, and countermined him by their indulgence to the people,
than to oppose themselves downright, and ruine him and their whole Country together;
for could they by any art or insinuation have gained the affections of the City, they had
taken from him the only thing upon which he relyed, without noise or confusion, and they
might have opposed in all his counsels, without fear of the people: if he be urged here,
that if the Citizens which were enemies to Piero committed an error, in not taking the
same course to retain as he had done to debauch the people, Peter committed the same fault
by not making use of the same instruments which his adversaries employed against him;
it is answered, that Soderini indeed might have tryed, but he could have done it neither
with honour or case; for the way that his adversaries took was to set up the Medici, by
whose assistance they bearded him exceedingly, and ruined him at last; and it had been
dishonourable for Soderini to have deserted the liberties of the people, which he had un|dertaken
to defend, and gone over to the party of the Medici; nor could he have done it
so secretly or suddenly, but the people would have smelt it, and have turned the violence of
their affection into as furious and hatred, which would have made his destruction much more
easy to his enemies, for who-ever was but suspected to be a favourer of the Medici, was
thought, ipso facto, an adversary to the people. It is necessary therefore in all deliberations
to weigh all things, to consider what danger and what advantage every thing will yield, and
make choice of what is least dangerous: otherwise it will happen to you as it did to Mar|cus
Tullius, who raised and augmented the greatness of Mark Anthony by the same way
which he intended for his destruction; for when Mark Anthony was declared an enemy by
the Senate, having a great Army attending him, and most of them of Caesar's old Soldiers,
Cicero to draw them off from him, persuaded the Senate to put Octavius at the head of
their Army, and sent him (with the Consuls) against Antonius, pretending that the very
name of Octavius (being Nephew to Caesar) would bring over all his Unckles party to him,
whereby Antonius would be so weakned it would be no hard matter to reduce him. But
it hapned quite contrary; for Antonius having gained Octavius to his side, they joyned their
Forces against Tully and his Senate, and ruined their whole Party. Which might have been
easily foreseen; nor ought Cicero so imprudently to have reviv'd the name of Caesar, by

whom the whole world was brought into servitude, and especially Rome; nor have per|suaded
himself that a Tyrant or any of his race would ever restore that liberty which his
Predecessor had suppressed.


CHAP. LIII.
The people (deceived with a false appearance of good) do many times desire that
which turns to their destruction: and how great hopes and large promises do
easily debauch them.
AFter the taking of Veii by the Romans, a report being spread of the convenience and
pleasantness of the Town, and richness of the Country about it, the people of Rome
began to fancy that it would be much for their advantage to transplant one half of their
City, aud send them thither to inhabit, for there were many fair houses to receive them;
and it could be no weakning or diminution to Rome, seeing the distance betwixt the two
Cities was so small; Veii would be taken rather for a member of Rome, than a distinct and
particular City. The Senate and graver sort of Citizens had so little inclination to this
design, that they resolved to die before ever they would consent to it. The people were so mad
upon it on the other side, that when it came to a debat, and it was to be resolved what was
to be done, the dispute was so hot, they had proceeded to blows, and the whole Town
been engaged in blood, had not the Senate interposed certain ancient and eminent men,
who by their interest and veneration among the people defended the blow, and appeased
them for that time. In which passage there are two things considerable: the first, that the
people being deceived with a false imagination of good, do many times solicit their own
ruine, and run the Commonwealth upon infinite dangers and difficulties, unless some per|son
in whom they have great confidence strikes in to instruct them which is the good, and
which is the evil; and when by accident it falls out that the people (having been formerly
deceived either by persons or things) cannot repose that confidence in any one, then of ne|cessity
all goes to wrack, and nothing can prevent it: to this purpose Dante in his discourse
about Monarchy, tells us,
Il popolo molte volte grida
Vivala sua morte,  muoia la sua vita.
The enraged multitude do often crie
Give us our death, our life we do defie
This incredulity is many times the occasion that good counsels are neglected, as it hapned
to the Venetians when invaded by several enemies at one time, they could not take off any
one of them, by restoring what they had taken wrongfully from other people; which was
the occasion of the war, and almost of their ruine. From whence we may consider the
easiness and difficulty of persuading the people, and make this distinction, if the affair
proposed be in appearance either magnanimous, or profitable, though at the bottom it be
never so distructive, the people are always easie to be persuaded: on the other side, if any
thing be offered (how honourable, how useful soever) with the least shew or glance of
cowardize or inconvenience, they are never, or with great difficulty to be wrought to
it. To confirm this, we have many examples both modern and ancient in Rome and
other places. From hence sprang their jealousies against Fabius Maximus, who
could never beat it into the heads of that City, that it was better for their Common
wealth to protract, and spin out the war, than to push things on, and bring all
to the hazard of a Battel; for the people looking upon it as cowardly and base coun|sel,
and not discerning the utility at the bottom, would by no means admit it; and Fa|bius
wanted rhetorick to enforce it upon them: and so strangely are they blinded sometimes
with their bravery and courage, that though the Romans had committed the same error
once before, and given authority to Fabius his Master of the Horse to fight when he saw
occasion whether Fabius would or not; (which authority had like to have ruined the
whole Army, had not Fabius with his prudence prevented it) yet that experiment doing no
good, they were guilty again and invested Varro with the same power, upon no other ac|count,
but because he had swagger'd up and down the Town, that when-ever they qualified

him with such a Commission, he would fight Hanibal, cut him to pieces; they believe
what he said, give him authority; and what followed? Why they were beaten at Cannas;
the Roman Army cut off; and the Roman Empire almost extinguished. And not unlike
this was the example of Marcus Centenius Penula, (a mean person, and considerable for
nothing but some small command in the Army) who presented himself one day to the Se|nate,
and offered if they would give him power to raise an Army of Voluntiers where he
pleased all over Italy, he would undertake in a short time to beat Hanibal out of it. The
Senate was sensible the proposition was rash, yet (considering withal that if they should
deny him, and report should come of it afterwards to the people, it might dissatisfie them;
beget some tumult in the City; and be the occasion of envy and animosity to themselves)
they granted his request, choosing rather to expose all those who were so ill advised as to
follow him, than run the hazard of new dissentions at home. Having got his Commis|sion,
and afterwards his Men, with a confused and disorderly Army he marches against
Hanibal, and fought him, but he failed of his promise, for he was killed himself, and most
of his Forces. In Greece in the City of Athens, Nicias, a grave and wise Citizen, could
never persuade the people against an Expedition into Sicily; but persuing it against all
sober advise, they miscarried, and their own Country was ruined. Scipio, when he was
made Consul, desired that he might have Africk for his province, and he would undertake
to demolish Carthage but the Senate being averse upon the judgment of Fabius Maximus,
Scipio threatned to propose it to the people, as knowing very well how gratful it would
be to them, We might produce examples of the same nature out of our own City of
Florence, as when Hercules Bentivogli General of the Florentine Army, with Antonio Gia|comini,
having defeated the Forces of Bertolomeo at San Vincenti, they went to besiege Pisa,
which enterprize was debated and concluded by the people, upon the great promises which
Hercules had made, though indeed the wiser sort of Citizens were against it; but the mul|titude
were possessed with great matters that would be done, and nothing could dissuade
them. I say then, there is not an easier way to ruine a State where the authority is in the
people, than to put them upon some gallant, but desperate enterprize; for where there is
any thing of magnanimity in their nature, it is sure to be embraced, and it is not in the wit
of men to dissuade them: but as this is many times the ruine of the State, so it is more
often and more certainly the destruction of those Citizens which promoted and comman|ded
it, for the people full of expectations of victory, when they find they have miscarried,
never impute it to an ill accident or fortune, but throw all upon the ignorance or treachery
of their Commanders, which seldom escape without being banished, imprisoned, or killed;
as has hapned to several of the Carthaginian and Athenian Captains. Nor does it avail
that they have been victorious before; for their present misfortune drowns all, as it fell out
to Antonio Giacomini our General, who not taking Pisa as he promised, and the people ex|pected,
fell into so great disgrace with them, that notwithstanding the many great things
which he had done, he was permitted to live, more by the favour and humanity of the Go|vernors,
than by gratitude or good nature of the people.


CHAP. LIV.
How great the authority of a grave man is, to asswage the tumultuousness
of the people.
THe second thing remarkable, that was mentioned in my last Chapter, is, that their is
nothing more certain to appease a popular tumult, and reduce the people to reason,
than the interposition of some wise person of authority among them; as Virgil has told
us with very good reason.
Tum pietate gravem, ac meritis si forte virum quem
Conspexere, silent, arrectis auribus adstant.
If in their tumults, a grave man appears,
All's whist, and nothing stirring but their ears.
He therefore who commands in a mutinous Army, or in a seditious City, and desires to
appease either the one or the other, is in my judgment to present himself with the most grace
and advantage that he can; adorned with all the ornaments of his dignity, and what-ever

else may make him venerable to the people. Not many years since Florence was divided
into Factions, the Frateschi and the Arabiati; and their animosity was so great, they came
to blows, and the Frateschi were overthrown, and Pagolantonio Soderini slain among the
rest, who was as eminent a Citizen as most of his time; upon the strength of this Victory
the people ran in a tumult to his house, with intention to plunder it; but his Brother Fran|cesco
(then Bishop of Volterra, and Cardinal now) being accidently there, as soon as he
understood how things were, and perceived the rabble to encrease, he called for the richest
of his Robes, and having put them on, and his Episcopal Rochet over them, he marched
out into the croud, and by the Majesty of his person, and the efficacy of his language, pre|vailed
with them to forbear, and to return peaceably to their houses; which action was so
grateful to the City, that it was celebrated publickly many daies after. I conclude there|fore
that there is not a surer, nor more necessary way to compose the distractions of the
people, than the appearance of some grave person in such a posture as may make him vene|rable
to them. To return therefore to what we said before, it may be seen from hence,
with what obstinacy the Romans accepted of that proposition for transplanting to Veii, be|cause
they thought it profitable, and did not perceive the inconvenience that was in it; for
as there hapned many tumults thereupon, so much more mischief had followed, had not the
Senate and some other grave persons interposed, and by good fortune restrain'd them.


CHAP. LV.
How easily things are managed in a City where the Commons are incorrupt; how
hard it is to erect a principality where there is an equality; and where it is not,
a Commonwealth is impossible.
THough we have declared before what we thought was to be expected from a City
whose inhabitants were totally corrupt; yet that will not hinder us from considering
the subtilty of the Senate in relation to a vow which Camillus had made to consecrate the
tenth part of the spoils of the Veientes to Apollo; which spoils being fallen into the clutches
of the Common people, the Senate had no way but to publish an Edict, requiring all of
them at a certain time and place to bring in the tenth part of their gains. 'Tis true, that
Proclamation had no great effect, because another expedient was found out to satisfie the
vow; yet it is remarkable, the confidence the Senate had in the good nature and comply|ance
of the people; and the great opinion that they would punctually bring in what-ever
they were commanded. On the other side it is observable, that the people went not about
to shuffle or defraud the Edict by bringing in less than their due; but declared frankly
against it, as a thing illegally required. Which example, with many other which I have
mentioned before, are brought to shew the probity and religion wherewith that people was
endued, and what good might be expected from them: and certainly where there is not
that submission and conformity, no confidence is to be had; as in those Provinces which
are corrupted at this day, in Italy above all the rest, and I may say in France and in Spain,
which are likewise in some measure under the same corruption; for tho they are not perhaps
subject to so many, and so dangerous disorders as we are in Italy; yet it proceeds not from
the meliority of the people, but from the excellence of their constitution, being governed
by a Monarchy, which keeps them united, not only by the virtue and example of their
Prince, but by the Laws and Customs of each Kingdom, which are preserved to this day.
Germany is the place of the whole World where the footsteps of the old Romans virtue and
fidelity is conspicuous; and that fidelity is the cause why so many Cities live happily in li|berty;
for they are so careful and studious of their Laws, that that very one thing keeps
them from servitude, and being over-run by their enemies; and if any instance be desired
of this more than ordinary probity in the Germans, I shall produce one, not unlike that be|fore,
betwixt the Senate and the people of Rome. It is the custom in those States when
they have occasion for mony upon the publick account, for the councils and Magistrates in
authority to lay a tax of one or two per cent. upon all the inhabitants under their jurisdi|ction,
according to their respective Estates; at the day and place appointed for payment,
every man appears with his mony, and having taken his oath first that the sum he pays is
according to the full of his Estate, he throws it into a chest provided for that purpose, and
no notice taken what it is he throws in; from whence we may conclude that there is still
some sparks left in that people of their old ingenuity and religion: nor is it to be doubted
but every man pays his due, for otherwise the sum would not amount to the imposition, nor

to what they formerly paid; whereby the fraud would be discovered, and they become lia|ble
to a new tax: which integrity and justice is the more admirable in our days, because it
is to be found no where but in Germany, and the reason (as I conceive) is twofold; one, be|cause
they have had little or no commerce with their neighbours, neither trading into
foreign parts, nor admitting foreigners into theirs; contenting themselves with their own
diet, and clothes, and commodities, and thereby preventing all occasion of evil conversation,
which is the corruption of good manners, especially among the French, the Spaniards and
Italians, which are wicked enough to debauch the whole World. The other reason is, be|cause
those Commonwealths who have preserved their liberties, and kept themselves in|corrupt,
do not suffer any of their Citizens to live high, and at the rate of a Gentleman;
but they live all in an equality and parity, as those few Noblemen or Gentlemen who are
there are very odious to the people; and when-ever any of them fall by accident into their
hands, they die without mercy, as those who are the fountain of all their luxury, and the oc|casion
of their scandal. I call those Gentlemen who live idly and plentifully upon their
Estates without any care or employment, and they are very pernicious where-ever they
are; but above all, they are most dangerous, who, besides their great revenues, have their
Castellanies, their Jurisdictions, and their Vassels, which pay them fealty and homage: of
these two sorts the Kingdom of Naples, the Territories of Rome, Romagna and Lombardy
are full; for which reason there is no such thing as a free State in all those Countries, be|cause
the Gentry are mortal enemies to those constitutions, and it would be impossible to
erect a Republick where they had the dominion; if any alteration be to be wrought, it is
by reducing them into a Monarchy; for the matter being so corrupt, that the Laws are be|come
ineffectual to restrain them, there is a necessity that force be applyed, and that by a
regal power the licentiousness and ambition of the Grandees be reduced into order: this
may be illustrated by the example of Tuscany, which is a small Territory, and yet has three
considerable Commonwealths in it, as Florence; Siena and Lucca; and the rest of the Ci|ties
of that Province, though they depend upon them, yet their minds and their laws shew
a strange propensity to freedom; all which proceeds from the scarcity of Gentry in those
parts, especially with such power and jurisdiction as aforesaid. On the contrary, there is so
great an equality among them, that if a prudent and publick man should happen among
them, who had any knowledg of that kind of Government, he might easily form them in|to
a solid Commonwealth: but hitherto it has been their misfortune to have no such man: I
conclude therefore, that he who would establish a Commonwealth, where the Country con|sists
most of Gentlemen, will find it impossible, unless he ruines them first; and on the other
side, he who would set up a Monarchy or Principality where the equality is great, must se|lect
the most considerable and unquiet amongst them; give them Castles, and Lands, and
Preferments, and any thing that may oblige them to his side: by which means they shall
not only maintain the power of their Prince, but their own insolence and ambition, and
the people be forced to submit to a yoke, to which nothing else could compel them: for
whilst there is a due proportion betwixt the Prince and the Subject, all things go well,
and every man enjoys his Estate: but to settle a Republick in a Country disposed to Monar|chy,
or to erect a Monarchy where the condition of the people have a tendency to a Com|monwealth,
requires a person of more than ordinary authority and brain: Many have
tried it, but very few have succeeded; the greatness and difficulty of the enterprize confoun|ding
them so at first, that they know not where they are, and give over as soon as they have
begun. But it may be objected, that the constitution of the Venetian Government con|futes
my position, That no Commonwealth can be established where the Gentry are considerable;
for under that State no man is admitted to any office but those who are Gentlemen. I an|swer,
that the Venetian Gentry are nothing but name; for their Lands and Possessions are
very few, the principal part of their Estates lying in their merchandize and goods: besides,
none of them have any Seigneuries or Jurisdiction over the people, so that a Gentleman
among them, is but a title of honour and preheminence, founded upon none of those
things which in other places make them so considerable. For as in other Commonwealths
the Citizens are distinguished into several Orders, so Venice is entirely divided into two, the
Populace and the Gentry, the Gentry having, or being capable of all honours and employ|ments,
from which the Populace are utterly excluded; which for the reasons abovesaid, it
has produced no disturbance in that State. These things being considered, let him who
desires to erect a Government, settle a Commonwealth where there is a parity among the
inhabitants; and a Monarchy where there are many great men, and the Gentry numerous.
Otherwise his Government will be incongruous, and of little duration.



CHAP. LVI.
Great accidents, before they happen to any City or Province, are commonly pro|gnosticated
by some sign, or predicted by some men.
HOw it comes to pass, I know not; but by ancient and modern example it is evident,
that no great accident befalls a City or Province, but it is presaged by Divination, or
Prodigy, or Astrology, or some way or other; and that I may not go far for my proof, every
one knows what was foretold by Frier Girolamo Savonarola before the Expedition of
Charles viii into Italy; besides which it was reported all over Tuscany, that there were
arm'd men seen fighting in the air over the Town of Arezzo, and that the clashing of
their arms in the conflict was heard by the people.
It is generally known in Florence, that before the death of the old Laurence de Medici the
Duomo or chief Church in that City was struck with lightning, and the people destroyed:
and before Piero Sodermi (who was made Gonfaloniere for his life by the people) was ba|nished
and degraded, the Palace was burn'd by lightning likewise: many other instances
might be produced, which I omit for brevity sake: I shall only add one which is mentioned
by Livy before the coming of the French to Rome. Marcus Ceditius a Plebeian acquainted
the Senate, that passing one night about twelve a clock thorow the Via-nova, he heard a
voice (bigger than a mans) which advised him to let the Senate know, the French were up|on
their march to Rome. How these things could be, it is to be discoursed by persons well
versed in the causes of natural and supernatural events; for my part I will not pretend to
understand them, unless (according to the opinion of some Philosophers) we may believe,
that the air being full of intelligences and spirits, who foreseeing future events, and com|miserating
the condition of mankind, gives them warning by these kind of intimations,
that they may the more timely provide and defend themselves against their calamities.
But what-ever is the cause, experience assures us, that after such denuntiations, some extra|ordinary
thing or other does constantly happen.


CHAP. LVII.
The multitude united, is formidable and strong, but separated, is weak
and inconsiderable.
THe Romans being overthrown, and their Country much wasted, upon the coming of
the French; many of them (contrary to an express Order and Edict of the Senate)
transplanted to Veii, and left Rome. Whereupon, by a new Proclamation, the Se|nate
commanded, that by a precise day, and upon a certain penalty, they should return to
their old habitations: when the news of this Proclamation was first brought to Veii, it was
despised and laugh'd at by every body; but when the day appointed for their return arri|ved,
there was not a man but pack'd up his goods, and came back as was required, and as Li|vy
says in the case, Ex ferocibus universis, singuli metu suo obedientes; Not one of them who
were so contumacious together, but apart began to fear, and that fear made him obedient. And
certainly nothing can give us a more lively description of the nature of a multitude than
this case. They are bold, and will speak liberally against the decrees of their Prince; and
afterwards when they see their punishment before their faces, every one grows fearful of
his neighbour, slips his neck out of the coller, and returns to his obedience. So that it is not
much to be considered what the people say, either of their Princes good management or
bad, so they be strong enough to keep them in their good humour when they are well
disposed, and provide (which they are ill) that they do them no hurt. But this ill disposi|tion
of the people, I mean all ill dispositions but what arise either from the loss of their
liberty, or the loss of some excellent Prince still living, upon whom they had setled their
affections.
For the evil dispositions proceeding from these causes are transcendently dreadful, and
strong remedies are to be applyed to restrain them.
In other cases their anger is nothing, especially having no body to head them; for as
there is nothing so terrible as their fury in one case, so there is nothing so vain and incon|siderable
in the other, because, though they have betaken themselves to their Arms, they

are easily reduced, if you can but avoid the first heat of their fury; for by degrees they will
cool, and every man considering it is his duty to return, will begin to suspect himself, and
think of his security, either by making his peace, or escape. Whenever therefore the
multitude is in a mutiny, their best way is immediately to choose themselves a Head, who
may correct, keep them united, and contrive for their defence, as the Romans did when
leaving Rome upon the death of Virginia; for their protection and security, They created
twenty Tribunes from among themselves: and if this course be neglected, it happens to
them as Livy presaged in the foregoing Sentence, That as nothing is more couragious than
the multitude united, so nothing is more abject when they are separate and divided.


CHAP. LVIII.
That the multitude is wiser, and more constant than a Prince.
THat nothing is more vain and inconstant than the multitude, Titus Livius and all other
Historians do agree. You shall many times find them condemning a man to death,
and lamenting him when he is dead, and wishing for him again. This hapned in the case
of Manlius Capitolinus, who being suspected to design against their liberty, was by the
people thrown headlong down the rock, and in a short time exceedingly regretted. The
words of our Author are these. Populum brevi, posteaquam ab eo periculum nullum erat,
desiderium ejus tenuit. When their fear of him was over, their affection revived. And in
another place where he shows the accidents which hapned in Syracuse after the death of
Girolamo Nephew to Hierone, he says, Haec natura multitudinis est, aut humiliter servit, aut
superbe dominatur. The nature of the Multitude is, to be servilly obedient, or insolently
Tyrannical.
Things being thus, I know not whether I shall not seem too bold; to undertake the de|fence
of a thing, which all the world opposes; and run my self upon a necessity of either
quitting it with disgrace, or pursuing it with scandal; yet methinks, being to maintain it
with arguments not force, it should not be so criminal. I say then in behalf of the
multitude; that what they are charged withal by most Authors, may be charged upon all
private persons in the world, and especially upon Princes; for whoever lives irregularly,
and is not restrained by the Law, is subject to the same exorbitancies, and will commit as
bad faults as the most dissolute multitude in the world: And this may be easily known, if
it be considered how many Princes there have been, and how few of them good, I mean
of such Princes as have despised, and broke thorow those Laws which were intended to
restrain them. The Kings in Egypt were not anciently of this sort, for they were govern'd
by Laws in those Provinces from the very beginning; and the Kings of Sparta were the
same: Nor need we look back so far for examples; we have the Kings of France in our
own days, whose Kingdom in my judgment, is at this time the most regular, and best
govern'd in the world. Those Princes therefore who are born under such Laws and Con|stitutions,
and obliged to live by them, are not to be reckoned or compared with the disso|lute
and mutinous multitude; but they are to be considered with a multitude under the
same Laws and restrictions; As the people of Rome were whilst their Commonwealth
was incorrupt, and they were found neither to be insolent in authority, nor slavish in their
subjection; but by their Laws, and their Magistrates, they kept up their dignity with
honour: And if at any time necessity required that they should appear against the power of
any particular person; they did it effectually, as in the cases of Manlius, the Decem-viri,
and others who designed to enslave them. On the other side, when it was for the interest
of the Publick, they were as obsequious and dutiful to the Dictators and Consuls, as they
had been obstinate before. Nor was their regret for Manlius when he was dead, at all to be
admired; it was the memory of his virtues that caused it, which are commendable even
among Enemies. The same thing might have hapned to the best of Princes; for all wri|ters
agree, that virtue is laudable wheresoever it is to be found. And I am of opinion,
that could Manlius have been raised again, and presented to them in the height of their
sadness, they would have served him as before, discharged him of his imprisonment, but
condemned him to death. Nor are Princes (and those held very wise) exempt from this
kind of inconstancy. They have put many to death, and lamented them afterwards; as
Alexander for Clito, and other of his friends, and Herod for Mariamnes. But what Titus
Livius says of this subject, is not intended of a multitude regulated by Laws, as the Romans
were; but a loose and disorderly multitude, like the people of Syracuse, who behaved them|selves

like mad-men, and committed the same faults that Herod and Alexander had com|mitted
before them. The multitude therefore is no more to be accused of fury and incon|stancy,
than a Prince; for they are both subject to extravagance, when they have no Laws,
nor no rules to restrain them. And of this (besides what I have said) there are many
examples, not only among the Roman Emperors, but among other Princes and Tyrants,
which have been guilty of more giddiness and inconstancy, than any multitude whatever.
I conclude therefore against the common opinion, that the people are no more light, in|grateful,
nor changeable than Princes; but that both of them are equally faulty, and he
that should go about to excuse the Princes, would be in a very great error; for a people
which governs by Law, and is well ordered, shall be as stable, as wise, and as grateful as a
Prince, and perhaps more, though he be never so wise: And on the other side, a dissolute
and irregular Prince shall be more mutable, imprudent, and ingrateful, than any multitude
whatever, and that not so much from any diversity in his Nature (for they are much at
one, and if there be any excellence, 'tis on the side of the people) as from their greater
or lesser respect to the Laws under which they are to live: And he who shall consider the
people of Rome, will find that for 400 years together, they hated the very name of a King,
were ambitious of honour, and studious exceedingly for the good of their Country, as may
be justified by many examples. If it be objected that the Romans were ingrateful to Sci|pio,
I refer them to what I proved so largely before, that the people are less ingrateful than
Princes. And as to prudence, and constancy, I affirm, They have much the advantage,
and are more wise, more steddy, and more judicious than Princes; for which reason the
voice of the people, is resembled to the voice of God, because by some occult and singular
quality it does often presage things that are wonderful, and relating to their own welfare
or calamity. In giving their judgment about dubious things, you shall seldom find them
mistake, if at any time two eminent Orators equally excellent in their profession, do con|trovert
and discourse a thing pro and con before them, they will assuredly take the most
rational side; which shows they are no less capable of truth, than other people. And if
in matters of honour, or enterprize which carry an appearance of publick utility, they be
sometimes mistaken, (as is said before) the Princes are more, by reason of their passions,
and perturbations of mind, to which they are much more obnoxious than the people. In
the election of Magistrats they are more dexterous, and judicious than Princes, nor, shall
the people be ever persuaded to advance a corrupt, and infamous man, which among
Princes is easie and common. If it takes a disgust or abhorrency to any thing, 'tis not
readily removed, but sticks by them for several ages, which among Princes is not so; both
which points may be evicted by the people of Rome, who in so many hundred years, and
so many elections of Consuls, and Tribunes, never made four elections that they repented
of afterwards, and for the name of a King they abhorred it so perfectly, that no virtue,
no former Service to his Country could excuse any man whom they suspected to aspire to
it. It is evident likewise that those Cities which are governed by the people, have enlarged
their Territories in a short time, and extended their Empire farther, than those who have
been subject to Princes; as Rome after the expulsion of Kings, and Athens after they had
rescued themselves from the tyranny of Pisistrates; which can proceed from nothing, but
that the Government by a free State is intrinsically better, than the Government by a
Prince: Nor can Livy's expression about the levity of the Syracusans oppose my opinion;
for let all the good and ill qualities of the Prince and people be compared, and it will be
found, That the people are less extravagant, and more honourable of the two. And if
in the instituting of good Laws, the ordaining of new Statutes, and the making new Or|ders
for civil conversation and Society, Princes have the better, yet the people preserving,
and executing them better than they, are doubtless as worthy of praise, as the Founders
themselves. To be short, Principalities and Republicks have both of them subsisted several
years, and both of them had occasion to be regulated and reformed; for a Prince that
is licentious, and does what he has a mind to; has a mind to that which does him hurt, and
is a weak man for his pains; and the people which takes the same liberty, is as mad on the
other side. And if the comparison be made betwixt mix'd Principalities, that are cir|cumscribed,
and bounded by Laws, and popular Governments under the same tyes and
restrictions; the people will be found more virtuous than the Princes; but if it be betwixt
loose and dissolute Governments both of the one kind, and the other, the errors on the
side of the Princes will appear more great, more numerous, and more incapable of redress;
for in popular tumults, a sober man may interpose, and by fair words reduce them to rea|son;
but to an enraged Prince, who dares intercede; or what remedy is there to repair to,
but violence, and the Sword? From whence we may judge and distinguish betwixt the
inconvenience of the one and the other: The people are appeased with gentleness, and

good words; and the Prince not to be prevailed upon, but by violence and force; and if it
be so, who is it that will deny, That the Disease is more dangerous, where the Cure is most
difficult? Moreover when the people tumultuate, there is not so much fear of any present
mischief that they are likely to commit, as of the consequences of it, and that it may end
in a tyranny. But with ill Princes it is quite contrary, the present misery is the most dread|ful,
because they hope when he dyes, their liberty may be recovered. You see then the
difference betwixt them; one is more dangerous at present, and the other for the future;
the cruelty of the people extends only to such as (in their opinion) conspire against the
common good. The severity of the Prince, is more against them who design against his
particular interest. But this opinion of the people goes daily down the wind; for every
man has liberty to speak what he pleases against them (though even the Government be
popular:) But against a Prince no man can talk without a thousand apprehensions, and
dangers. Nor will it seem to me incongruous (the matter having drawn me thus far) in
my next Chapter to discourse what Confederacies are most safe, those which are made with
Princes, or those which are made with Commonwealths.


CHAP. LIX.
What Leagues or Confederacies are most to be trusted; Those which are made
with Princes, or those which are made with free States.
BEcause Princes with Princes, and free States among themselves, and many times with
Princes do enter into leagues of friendship and confederacy, I thought it not amiss to
enquire in this place, whose faith is the most firm, and in whose amity the greatest confi|dence
is to be reposed. Having considered it diligently with my self, it seems to me that
in many cases they are alike, and in some they differ. And first, when necessity of State
requires, and there is any visible danger of losing the Government, neither the one nor the
other are so precise, but they will make bold with their engagements, and behave them|selves
ingratefully: Demetrius Poliorcetes had obliged the Athenians by many good Offices;
but his Army being aftewards defeated, and himself flying to them for refuge, as to his
Confederates, and Friends, he was repulsed, and not admitted into the City, which trou|bled
him more than the loss of his Army. Pompey being beaten in Thessalia by Caesar fled
likewise into Egypt to Ptolomy, whom he had formerly restored to his Kingdom, and was
murthered by him for his confidence. In both these Examples the ingratitude seems to be
the same; yet the inhumanity was greater on the Princes side, than on the Common|wealths;
but be it as it will, when the State is in danger, they are neither of them scru|pulous.
And if there be any Prince or Commonwealth so punctual as to preserve their
league, though with destruction to themselves; it may proceed from the same causes. It
may very well happen that a Prince may confederate with some other great Potentate,
(who though unable to defend him at that time; may give him hopes notwithstanding of
restoring him some other) and persevere in his Confederacy, as thinking that by having
made himself of that Princes party, he has rendered his accommodation with the adver|sary
imposible. This was the case of all the Neopolitan Princes who sided with the French
in their Expedition unto those parts: And as to the free States, they suffered of old some|thing
in this Nature, as Saguntum in Spain, which City chose rather to expose its self to
direption, and all the Calamities of War, than forsake its confederacy with the Romans,
and in the year 1512. Florence did almost the same to continue its amity with the French.
So that computing every thing, and considering what both parties have done upon such
imminent and irresistable danger, I believe there is more constancy and firm friendship to
be found among Commonwealths than among Princes; for though perhaps they may
have the same sentiments and inclinations as Princes; yet their motions, and resolutions
being slower, they are longer before they violate their faith. But when their leagues and
confederacies are to be broken, upon the bare prospect of advantage; in that case your
Commonwealths are much more religious and severe; and examples may be brought
where a small gain has tempted a Prince, when a great one could not move a Common|wealth.
Themistocles in an Oration to the Athenians, told them, That he had something
to advise that would be infinitely to their advantage, but durst not communicate it in pub|lick,
because to publish it, would hinder the Execution; whereupon the people deputed
Aristides to receive it; and act in it afterwards as he should think convenient. Themi|stocles
acquainted him, That the whole Grecian Fleet (though under their passport and

parole) were in a place where they might be all taken or destroyed, which would make
the Athenians absolute Masters in those Seas; and Aristides reported to the people, That
the Council of Themistocles was profitable, but would be a great dishonour to their State;
upon which it was unanimously rejected. But had the same occasion been offered to
Philip of Macedon, or some other Princes, they would not have been so tender; for it
was a practice among them (and especially with Philip) who got more by breaking his
faith, than by all his other designs. As to the breaches upon the non-observance of Arti|cles,
they are ordinary things, and I have nothing to say of them: I speak only of extra|ordinary
occasions, and am of opinion from what I have said, That the people do trans|gress
less in that Nature, than Princes, and may therefore with more confidence be
trusted.


CHAP. LX.
How the Consulship, and other Dignities in Rome were conferred
without respect of age.
IT is manifest in the History of the Roman Commonwealth, that after the people
were made capable of the Consulship, the Citizens were promiscuously prefer'd with|out
respect either of age or extraction; but any man was advanced for his Virtue, whe|ther
he was a young man, or an old: and this was evident in Valerius Corvinus, who
was created Consul in the 23 year of his age; upon which consideration in one of his
Speeches to the Army, he told them that the Consulship was, Praemium Virtutis, non
Sanguinis. The reward, not of Nobility, but Virtue. Whether this was prudently done,
or not, may admit of dispute: But as to the receiving all sorts of persons to that dignity
without consideration of their blood; there was a necessity of that, and the same necessi|ty
that was in Rome, may happen in any other City that desires to do the same great things
which were done in Rome, of which we have spoken elsewhere. For men are not to be
persuaded to suffer, but in hopes of reward; and that hope cannot be taken away, with|out
manifest danger. It was but equitable therefore that the people should be capable
of the Consulship, that being nourished a while with only the hopes, they might at length
be so happy as to have it in effect. A City that employs not its people in any great affair,
may order them as it pleases; but if it designs to extend its Empire, and do as the Romans
did, there must be no distinction. And that no regard ought to be had of any man's age,
appears by this, That in the election of a young man to a degree, in which the wisdom of
an old man is requisite, the multitude being to elect, it is necessary that the young man
be recommended by some extraordinary Exploit; and when a young man is so happy, as
to have made himself conspicuous in the City by some honourable Atchievement, it were
not only hard, but inconvenient if the said City might not receive the benefit of his vir|tue
immediately, but be forced to attend till his mind as well as body was super-annuated,
and all that vigour and promptitude lost, which at that time might have been so serviceable
to his Country: at which age Valerius Corvinus, Scipio, Pompey, and many others did
great things, and were permitted to triumph for their pains.




THE
DISCOURSES
OF
Nicholas Machiavel,
CITIZEN and SECRETARY
OF
FLORENCE,
Upon The
First Decade of LIVY
TO
ZANOBI BVONDELMONTI,
AND
COSIMO RVCELLAI.
LIBER II.

The Preface.
IT is the common practice of Mankind, to commend the ancient, and condemn the pre|sent
times; but in my judgment not always with reason; for so studiously are they de|voted
to things of antiquity, that they do not only admire what is transmitted by old
Authors, but applaud and cry up when they are old, the passages and occurrences
in their youth. But my opinion is, This their way of computation is many times false,
and that upon several accompts. First, because of such very ancient things we can have
no absolute knowledge; for most commonly in the Narrative of affairs, what is infamous,
or ill done, is pretermitted in silence, whilst what is well done, and honourable, is related
with all the Arts, and amplifications of Rhetorick; for so much are Historians accustomed
to attribute to the fortune of the Conqueror, that to encrease his praise, they do not only
exspatiate upon his Conduct, and Exploits, but they do likewise so magnifie and illustrate
the very actions of the Enemy, That they who come after beholding things at a great di|stance,
have reason to admire those times, and those men, and by consequence to love them.
Besides it being envy or fear which disposes people to hatred; neither of those passions ex|tending
to what cannot possibly hurt them, two great causes are wanting of finding fault
with Antiquity; for as things so long passed cannot any way prejudice, so they cannot

provoke to envy or discontent: But present things which are obvious to our own sence,
are universally known, and no circumstance that passes (whether good or bad) that can
be totally conceal'd; from whence it proceeds, that observing with the excellence and vir|tue
of our present affairs, whatever is concomitant of imprudence or vice, we are in a man|ner
compelled to postpone them to things of antiquity, where the good only is displayed,
and the bad passed by, though perhaps the present things are more worthily glorious. I do
not intend any thing hereby of the Arts and Sciences of our predecessors, so highly im|proved
and illustrated, that 'tis not in the power of time either to add any thing, or sub|stract.
I only speak of the manners and civil conversations of men; in which indeed we
have not so many virtuous examples, as were to be found among our Ancestors: So that
it is not altogether unjustly if antiquity be prefer'd; yet are not our present transactions to
be always condemn'd as worse than the former, as if antiquity had no errors at all. Hu|mane
affairs are in perpetual fluctuation, and have their times of decrease, as well as ad|vancement.
A City or Province founded by some excellent person upon good Principles
and Laws, not only stands, but flourishes and increases a long time in honour, authority, and
wealth; and those persons whose happiness it is to be born under those governments
whilst they are glorious, and powerful, are apt to prefer their old Customs, to the disparage|ment
of the new; yet they are in an error, and for the reasons abovesaid. But those who
are born when the State is in its declension, do not so much transgress when they commend
what is pass'd, and decry what is present; which things (having seriously considered with
my self) I conceive to be caused, because the world has been always the same, and made up
promiscuously of good things and bad; yet these good and bad things have varied some|times,
and as it were transmigrated from one City, and one Province to another; so that
in those places where virtue has been a long time predominant, vice has stoln in by degrees,
and supplanted it; which is evident by the revolutions of Kingdoms and Empires, where
virtue and justice has had its time, and been transfused afterwards into other Countries.
However the world was the same, though its virtue and magnanimity was unstable, remo|ving
and shifting from the Assyrians first, to the Medes, from the Medes to the Persians,
and from them to the Romans; and if after the Roman Empire, there has been no go|vernment
so great as to comprehend and ingross the virtue of the whole world; yet the
same virtue that was of old among the Romans is not extinct, but dispersed and branched
out into several Kingdoms and Provinces, as the Kingdom of France, the Kingdom of the
Turks, the Kingdom of the Soldan, the Empire of the Germans, and the Sect of the Sa|racins,
which conquered so many Provinces, and committed such devastations, as were the
ruine of the Empire of the East. In these Kingdoms rent and divided from the Empire
of the Romans, the old Roman virtue is diffused, and retains still something of its pristine
lustre, so that it may without injustice be admired in some places: Which being so, he who
is born in those Provinces where the Roman virtue and discipline is still in being (but
declining) if he applauds his old Country-men, and blames his Contemporaries, his
error is not great: But he that is born in Italy, and is not in his heart a Tramontan, or
in Greece, and is not a Turk, must needs bewail his own times, and cry up his Predecessors,
in which he will find many things well worthy his admiration; whereas in these there is
nothing but wickedness and obloquy, no Religion, no Laws, no Discipline, but all things
impure and brutish, and they are the more detestable and deplorable, by how much the
same persons who would be imitated, and are set aloft to command all, and correct those
that are vitious, are most dissolute, and most vitious themselves.
But to return to our discourse, I say, That though humane judgment is frail, and may
be mistaken in its Character of such things as by reason of their antiquity, cannot fall so
perfectly under ones Cognizance; yet that will not excuse old men for preferring the tran|sactions
in their youth, because both the one and the other were equally liable to their
knowledge; nor would they be of that opinion, if men had the same sentiment and appe|tite
as long as they lived; but our affection altering, and our rational Soul being otherwise
disposed than formerly, we judge otherwise of things, though the times be the same; for
how is it possible the same things should please in our youth and old age, when their Stu|dies,
and delights are so different and remote? For (to say no more) as the quickness and
vigour of the body decreases in old men, so their judgment and prudence increase propor|tionably;
and thence it follows that the same things which seemed tolerable in their youth
grow insupportable when they are old; so that the fault is more in their judgment, than the
age, for supposing those things to be good, which, being wiser, by experience, they find
to be otherwise. To which it may be added, that the desires of mankind are immense, and
unsatiable; that naturally we are covetous of every thing, whereas fortune allows us but
little; That from thence it happens that no an is contented, every man despises what he

is already possessed of, commends what is passed, condemns what is present, and longs for
what is to come, though induced by no reasonable occasion. Things being thus, I cannot
resolve my self whether ever I may not be of that number, who in these my discourses
have so highly magnified the old times and exploits of the Romans, to the diminution of
our own: and truly, were not the vertue of that age as clear as the Sun, and the wicked|ness
of ours as manifest as that, I should have been more moderate, and feared to have run
into the same error which I have condemned in other people.
But things being so evident, I may with boldness deliver my opinion of both times, to
the end that the minds of such young persons, as shall peruse my conceptions, may be ad|monished
to avoid those vices which are so prevalent now, and prepared to imitate the vir|tue
of our Ancestors, when-ever occasion shall be offered. For it is the office of a good
man to recommend that to other people which he thinks for the interest and honour of his
Country, though perhaps the adversity of his fortune, and the malignity of the times will
not suffer him to practise it himself; that by his instructions so many, at least some one may
be so fortunate as to be able to follow him.
Wherefore having in may first Book done with what I proposed about the original in|stitution
of Government, and what was in my judgment necessary to preserve them: I
shall now in this second, discourse of what the Romans did abroad for the inlargement and
augmentation of their Empire.


CHAP. I.
Whether the vertue or fortune of the Romans was the occasion of the
greatness of their Empire.
MAny have thought, and Plutarch (a grave Author) among the rest, that the people of
Rome where more beholding to their fortune than virtue, in the acquisition of their
Empire; and among other reasons, he infers it from their own silent confession, in having
erected more Temples to Fortune than to any of their Gods. Livy seems to be likewise
of the same opinion; for he seldom introduces a Roman speaking any thing of virtue,
but immediately it is followed with fortune, with which nevertheless I can by no means
comply, nor believe it will hold water; for though no Commonwealth be to be found
that has made such progress as the Roman, why should it be rather imputed to their good
Fortune than the solid constitution of their Laws? the courage of their Armies, and the
excellent conduct of their Emperors, extended their Empire; and then their own just
measures, and the wise institutions of their first Legislator preserved what they got, as we
shall hereafter more largely discover. it is objected, that the Romans were never at one
time involved in two considerable wars, (which is imputed rather to their fortune than
wisdom) for they had no quarrel with the Latins till they had subdued the Samnites, and
were forced to make war in their defence; they had no controversie with the Tuscans till
they had beaten the Latins, and with their frequent victories almost extinguished the Sa|bines,
whereas if two of these States had confederated, and joyned their powerful Armies
against them, no doubt but the affairs of the Romans would have been in very great dan|ger.
But be it as it will, this is most certain, they never had two great wars upon their
hands at a time; but they began one when they ended the other, or the end of the first
was the beginning of the second; and this may be observed in the series of their wars,
for (to pass by their quarrels before Rome was taken by the French) whilst the Aequi and
Volsci were powerful and strong, they had no enemies but they; when they were conquer|ed,
their war broke out with the Samnites; and though before that was perfectly conclu|ded,
the Latins rebelled; yet before it could be brought to a war, the Samnites had made
their peace, and joyned their Army with the Romans, to reduce the Latini. That war be|ing
finished, the war with the Samnites revived, and was the occasion of much mischief to
the Samnites; after which, the Romans began with the Tuscans, and that being composed,
the Samnites broke out again upon the passage of Pyrrhus into Italy, who being repulsed in|to
Greece, they had opportunity for their wars with the Carthaginians, and their first war
with that State was no sooner determined, but the French, and the inhabitants on this and
the other side of the Alps conspired so effectually against them, that betwixt Popolonia and
Pisa (where the Tower of St. Vincent is at this day to be seen) the confederates were routed
with a very great slaughter.

This war being concluded, for twenty years together they had no considerable war, for
they had no body to fight with but the Ligures, and the resicts of those French who were
remaining in Lombardy. In this posture they continued till the second Punick war, which
lasted 16 years, and perplexed them exceedingly. That war being ended with a great deal
of honour, their next enterprize was against the Macedonians; after which their war hap|pened
with Antiochus in Asia, and when he was overcome, there was not a Prince or State
in the whole World, which by it self, or conjunction with the rest, was able to contend
with the Romans. But before this last victory, who-ever considers the method of their
wars, and their manner of proceeding, shall find great virtue and wisdom intermixed with
their good fortune, so that the reason of their good fortune is easily discovered; for this
is most certain, when a Prince or Commonwealth arrives at that height of reputation
that no neighbour-Prince or people dares venture to invade him, (unless compelled by in|dispensible
necessity) he may do what he pleases, 'tis in his Election with whom he will
make war, and with whom he will be at peace; for his neighbours being afraid of his
power, are glad to be his friends; and those Potentates who are farthest off, and have
no commerce with them, look on as unconcern'd, as if the consequence could have no re|flexion
on them; and in this error they do many times continue till the calamities be
brought home to their own dores; and then, when 'tis too late, they have nothing but
their own private force to oppose, which is too weak when the enemy is grown so strong.
I will not enlarge upon the Samnites, nor recount how they stood still, and look'd on, while
the Romans conquered the Aequi and the Volsci; but to avoid prolixity, I shall pass to the
Carthaginians, who were of great power and authority when the Romans were at war
both with the Somnites and Tuscans; they had the command of all Africk, and were
supreme in Sicily, Sardinia, and great part of Spain. Blinded with their power, and (as
they thought) secure in their distance, it never, came into their heads to invade
them at that time, or to give any assistance to the Samnites or Tuscans; but (according to
the practice of the World with things that are new, and encreasing) they rather sided with
them, and desired their friendship, not so much as perceiving their error, till the Romans
had conquered all the intermediate States, and began to contend with them for the Em|pire
of Sicily and Spain. And what hapned to the Carthaginians, hapned likewise to the
French, to Philip of Macedon, and to Antiochus; each of them believing (whilst the Ro|mans
were employed in their wars with other people) that they would either be overcome,
or that they themselves should have time enough to make peace or war with them, as they
saw it most for their advantage: so that considering what is good, I am of opinion that
the same fortune and prosperity may be expected by any Prince or State which exercises
the same virtue and industry as the Romans have done before them. And here we might
very properly discourse of the Roman method in the invasion of other Provinces, but we
have done that at large in our Treatise called the Prince; yet this I shall say in short, that
the Romans made always sure of some friend or other in the Provinces against which they
design'd, that might be a means to admit them, and gave them enterance, and help after|wards
to keep what they had been instrumental in getting. So by intelligence with the
Capuans they invaded Samnium; by the help of the Camertines they got into Tuscany; by
the Mamertines into Sicily; by the Saguntines into Spain; Massinissa gave them enterance
into Africk, the Etoli into Greece, Eumenes and other Princes into Asia, and the Massilien|ses
and Hedai into France; and as by their correspondence they conquered most of those
Countries, so by their interest they preserved them; which way, if diligently observed by
other people, it will be found that their prosperity depended less upon fortune than those
States who observed not that course: but to illustrate what we have said, and make it so
plain and perspicuous that every one may see how much more their virtue than their for|tune
contributed to their Empire; in our next Chapter we will consider what those peo|ple
were whom the Romans subdued, and with what obstinacy they defended their li|berty.



CHAP. II.
With what Nations the Romans contended, and with what obstinancy those
Nations resisted.
NOthing made it so difficult for the Romans to conquer their Neighbours, and some
other remoter Provinces, as the love which the people of those times did bear to their
liberty: for in defence of that, they were so indefatigably studious, that nothing but
singular and extraordinary virtue could have subdued them: and this is demonstrable by
the many and great dangers to which they exposed themselves, sometimes to preserve, and
sometimes to recover it; as also by the severity of their revenge upon those who had
usurp'd it. 'Tis evident likewise in History what detriment the People and Cities have
suffered whilst they were in servitude and subjection; and whereas now a-days there is but
one Province which can boast of free Cities, in ancient times there was not one Province
but had plenty. In Italy from the Alps (which divide Tuscany and Lombardy) to the ex|tremest
part of that Country, there were many free States; as the Tuscans, the Romans,
the Samnites, and others; nor is there mention of any King (but what reigned in Rome)
besides Porsena King of Tuscany, the extinction of whose Line, though not set down in
History, yet it is manifest that Tuscany was free at the time when the Romans encamped
before Veii; so well satisfied with their liberty, and so abhorring from the very name of a
King, that the Veientes having for their better defence created one in their own
Town, and sent to the Tuscans to implore their assistance against the Romans, after a grave
and solemn debate, it was resolved, no assistance should be sent whilst they were under the
dominion of a King; as thinking it unfit to engage in the defence of a Country that had
betraid it self, and prostituted to the dominion of a single person. Nor is this universal af|fection
to liberty so wonderful in the people.
Experience tells us, that no Cities have augmented their Revenues, or enlarged their
Territories, but whilst they were free and at liberty: and certainly 'tis a prodigious thing
to consider to what height and grandeur in an hundred years time the City of Athens ar|rived,
after it had freed it self from the tyranny of Pisistrates; but much more to consider
the greatness of Rome upon the expulsion of her Kings; and the reason of all is, because
in Common-wealths private wealth and emolument is not so much aim'd at as the im|provement
of the publick; nor is there any where so much care of the publick as in free
States, where what-ever is equitable, and for the common advantage, is decreed and execu|ted,
without respect to particular persons, who may perhaps be sufferers thereby; whereas
in Cities that are governed by a Prince it falls out quite contrary; for there, what makes
commonly for the advantage of the Prince, is prejudice to the publick: so that when a
free-State degenerates into a Tyranny, the least mischief that it can expect, is, to make no
further advancement in its Empire; and no farther encrease either in riches or power;
but for the most part it goes backward, and declines: and if it should so happen that the
Tyrant should be a virtuous man, and one who by his courage and military discipline should
enlarge his Dominions; yet what-ever he took would be converted to his own private
use, without any benefit to the publick. For he dares not advance any of those Citizens
(how worthy and honest soever) left he should have occasion to suspect them afterwards.
Nor can he make those Cities which he subdues, dependant or tributary to that where he
is absolute; for 'tis not the interest of a Tyrant to make his Subjects powerful or united;
but to keep them low, and divided, that every Town, every Province may depend wholly
upon himself; so that the Conquests of an Usurper may turn to his own profit, but never
to the publick; to which purpose many things are very handsomely written by Xenophon
in his Treatise of Tyranny; and things being thus, no body is to admire if our Ancestors
had so great a zeal for their liberty; and the very name of a Tyrant was so odious to them,
that when long since news was brought to the Army of the assassination of Hieronymo the
Nephew of Hiero of Syracuse, and the whole Camp was in an uproar against the Conspira|tors;
yet when it was told them that they had proclaimed Liberty, and a free Government,
they laid by their indignation against the Tyrannicids, and being pacified with the very
name of Liberty, fell into consultation how it was to be preserved. Nor is it to be won|dred
at then, if their revenge be so violent and extraordinary upon those who would
violate it; of which, though there be many examples, I shall instance only in one, but that
most remarkable and horrid; and hapning in Corcirca a City in Greece: for all Greece be|ing
divided, and consisting of two Factions, one of them under the protection of the Athe|nians,

and the other of the Spartans; and in Corcirca the Nobility prevailing, and ha|ving
usurped upon the liberty of the people, it hapned that the people being reinforced by
the assistance of the Athenians, overpowred the Nobility, and conquered them again. Ha|ving
restored their liberty, and shaked off their servitude, they clap'd up all the Nobility in
a large prison, and bringing them forth by ten at a time, as if they were to be banished,
they put them to death with most exquisite torments; which severity coming by degrees
to the ears of the remainder, they resolved to do what was possible to defend themselves
against it, upon which they stood upon their guard, and would suffer none of the Officers
to come in; whereupon, in a great fury, the people ran thither, pull'd off the covering of
the house where they were, and throwing down the walls, buried them all in the ruines:
and of this sort of cruelty there were many other examples in that Province; for the
people are usually more impetuous in revenging the loss of their Liberty, than in defen|ding
it.
But it may (not unfitly) be admir'd in this place what should be the cause that the anci|ents
should be more zealous for publick liberty than we in our days: if my opinion may
pass, I think it is for the same reason, that in those times men were more robust, and stron|ger
than now; which proceedeth much from the diversity betwixt their Education, their
Religion and ours: for whereas our Religion gives us a just prospect and contemplation
of things, and teaches us to despise the magnificence and pomp of the World; the Ethnicks
valued them so highly, and believing them their chiefest happiness, it made them more
fierce and busie to defend them, and this may be collected from several of their customs;
for if the sacrifices in their days be compared with the sacrifices in ours, theirs will be found
magnificent and horrid; ours delicate and neat, but neither so magnificent nor cruel.
They wanted not pomp nor formality in those ceremonies, and yet to make them the more
venerable and solemn, they added blood and slaughter to them, offering up infinite numbers
of beasts, which being slain before the people, made them more hard-hearted and
cruel. Moreover the Religion of the Gentiles did not place their beatitude any where but
upon such as were full of worldly glory, and had done some great action for the benefit
of their Country. In our Religion the meek and humble, and such as devote themselves
to the contemplation of divine things, are esteemed more happy than the greatest Tyrant,
and the greatest Conquerer upon Earth; and the summum bonum, which the others placed
in the greatness of the mind, the strength of the body, and what-ever else contributed to
make men active, we have determined to consist in humility, abjection, and contempt of
the World; and if our Religion requires any fortitude, it is rather to enable us to suffer
than to act. So that it seems to me, this way of living, so contrary to the ancients; has
rendred the Christians more weak and effeminate; and left them as a prey to those who
are more wicked, and may order them as they please, the most part of them thinking more
of Paradise than Preferment, and of enduring than revenging of injuries; as if Heaven
was to be won rather by idleness than arms: but that explication of our Religion is erro|neous,
and they who made it were poor and pusillanimous, and more given to their case
than any thing that was great: for if the Christian Religion allows us to defend and exalt
our Country, it allows us certainly to love it, and honour it, and prepare our selves so as we
may be able to defend it. But that lazy and unactive way of education, and interpreting
things falsly has been the cause that there are not so many Commonwealths as formerly in
the World, nor so many Lovers and Champions for their Liberty: and yet I believe the
greatness of the Roman Empire contributed something, by reducing all the free States and
Republicks under their Dominion.
Nevertheless when that great Empire was broken and dissolved, very few of those poor
States could recover their liberty: but when it began first to encrease and extend it self, no
Country was without them, and where-ever the Romans carried their Arms, they found
little Commonwealths banding and confederating against them, and defending their li|berties
with all imaginable constancy; which shews that the Romans were a people of more
than ordinary courage, or they could never have subdued them. The Samnites alone will
be example sufficient, who (as Livy reports) were so powerful, and so hearty defenders of
their liberty, that for 46 years together they maintained War with the Romans; and though
they had received many losses, and such devastations had been committed in their Country,
yet they could never be wholly reduc'd before the Consulship of Papyrius Cursor, the Son
of the first Papyrius. But 'tis a spectacle worthy of any mans pity, to see a Country so
full (formerly) of brave Cities, and brave men, and all of them free; now desolate and
uninhabited, and scarce any body left; to which condition it could have never been re|duced
but by the discipline, and diligence, and courage of the Romans: but all this pro|ceeded
from diversity of Constitution, for all Cities and free States whatsoever, encrease not

only in riches and authority, but in the numbers of their men: for who is it that had not
rather procreate and have children where he may marry and enrich himself freely, than
where there is danger that what he gets painfully, and lays up carefully for his children,
may be ravished from them by a Tyrant.
In a free State you may be sure your children shall be no slaves, and that if they behave
themselves virtuously, they shall be sure of preferment, and perhaps come to be Princes;
riches encrease there faster, and that not only by tillage and agriculture, but by traffick
and arts; and people do naturally throng to those places where they may get what they law|fully
can, and keep securely what they have got. The quite contrary happens in Coun|tries
that are servile, and their condition is worse, as their servitude is greater: but there
is no servitude so severe as to depend upon a Commonwealth, and that for two reasons;
first because it is more durable, and less hopes of recovering their liberty; and secondly,
because it is the practise of all Commonwealths to impoverish and weaken what-ever they
conquer, to fortifie themselves; which with Princes is not the way, unless they be very bar|barous
indeed, and like the Eastern Princes, who not only ruine whole Countries, but destroy
all human conversation: but where Princes are well instituted, they know better things, and
do many times indulge their new Conquests as much as their own Territories, leaving them
the exercise of their Arts, and the enjoyment of their Laws; so that though they cannot
encrease their wealth as where they are free; yet they are not so subject to be ruined as
where they are slaves: I speak now of servitude to a foreign Prince, for the usurpation of
a Citizen I have spoken before. All which being considered, no wonder if the Samnites
whilst they enjoyed their liberty were so couragious and strong, and when it was once lost
grew so abject and contemptible. Titus Livius tells us in his History of the Punick War,
that the Samnites were so overlaid and cowed by one single Legion of the Romans at
Nola, that they sent Embassadors to Hanibal to beg his assistance, and that the said Am|bassadors
in their Oration to Hanibal, the better to move his compassion, had this expres|sion,
We are the People who for an hundred years together waged War with the Romans
with our own private Forces, and bore up many times against two Armies and two Consuls
at once; but now our misery is so great, and our spirits so low, we are unable to defend our
selves against one pitiful Legion.


CHAP. III.
It contributed much to the grandeur of the City of Rome, that they ruined
the neighbouring Cities, and admitted strangers to their own dignities and
priviledges.
CRescit interea Roma, Albae ruinis; The ruine of Alba was the rise of the Romans. 'Twas
the saying of Livy, and 'tis true; for who-ever would make any City great, and apt
for dominion, must endeavour with all industry to throng it with inhabitants, otherwise it
will be impossible to bring it to any great perfection. And this is done two ways, by love
and by force: the first by giving passage and security to all persons that will come and in|habit
there, that every man shall be free; the second by destroying the neighbour Cities,
and forcing the people to come and dwell in yours. The Romans observed both ways,
and grew so numerous upon it, that in the time of their sixth King they had 80000 men in
the Town able to bear Arms, proceeding in some respects like the Country-man, who to
make his plant larger, and more fruitful, cuts off its first shoots, that the juyce and virtue
which otherwise would dilate into the branches, being kept close to the trunk, might break
out with more vigor afterwards, and make it more beautiful and fertile. And that this
way is necessary for the propagation of the strength and authority of a City, appears by
the example of Athens and Sparta, which Cities, though they were both free, numerous in
Men, and happy in their Laws; yet they could never arrive at the grandeur of the Ro|mans,
though Rome seemed more tumultuous, and not so well governed as they, and all for
the reason abovesaid: for Rome having by both those ways encreased the number of their
Citizens, was able to set out an Army at one time of 280000 men, whereas Sparta and Athens
could never exceed 20000. which is not to be attributed to the excellence of the situation
of Rome; but to the diversity of their Conduct; for Lycurgus the Founder of the Spartan
Commonwealth, conceiving nothing could be more pernitious to it, nor more easily abro|gate
his Laws, than intermixing with new inhabitants, he provided with all possible in|dustry
that his Citizens should have no commerce or conversation with strangers. To

that end he not only prohibited the admission of foreigners, and their marrying with them,
but that there might be no encouragement or occasion of entercourse betwixt them, he
put out a certain Mony of Leather, so pitifully inconsiderable, that he presumed no Mer|chants
would trouble themselves to import any foreign Commodities for it; by which
means that City was never in a capacity of being very populous: And because all human
affairs do hold some proportion and analogy with Nature; and it is impossible that a slen|der
trunk, should bear vast and ponderous branches, it is not to be expected that a small
Commonwealth consisting of a small number of Citizens, should subdue, or at least keep
and maintain greater and more populous States than themselves; and if it should happen
that they should conquer them at any time, upon every slight accident they would be sub|ject
to lose them, like the tree it would be too weak for its boughs, and every puff of wind
apt to blow it down. And thus it fell out with Sparta, though it had conquered all Greece,
made it self absolute thorow that whole Province; yet Thebes no sooner rebelled, but all
the rest of the Cities revolted, and having lost its great Empire in a moment, it remained
like a Tree destitute of its Branches. But with Rome it was otherwise, its Root and Trunk
was strong enough to support its Branches how heavy and spacious soever; and this was the
great cause of the greatness of the Roman Empire, which Livy expressed in two words,
when he said, Crescit interea Roma, Alvae ruinis.


CHAP. IV.
There are three ways which Commonwealths have taken to
enlarge their Territories.
HE who has read and observed the History of our Ancestors must find, That Common|wealths
had generally three ways of enlarging their Empire. One is that which
was observed of the Tuscans of old, who entred into a League of Confederacy with
several other Commonwealths, with condition of Equality, that no particular should
have any degree or authority above the rest, and that comprehension should be left for all
their new Conquests to come in, not much unlike the practice of the Swizzers in our
times, and the Achaians, and Aetolians of old. And because the Romans had in those
times much controversie with the Tuscans and their Confederates, I shall enlarge my self
something in the explanation of their affairs, of which, though there be but little Monu|ment
in History, yet we are assured, that before the greatness of the Romans, the Tuscans
were very powerful both by Sea, and by Land; of which power it is no small argument,
their sending a Colony into the Mare superum to a place called Adria, which grew so con|siderable
and famous, that it denominated that whole Sea, and it has been called the Mare
Adriaticum ever since. It is known likewise that their Empire extended from the Tyber to
the foot of the Alps, which comprehends the greatest part of Italy at this day; though 200
years before the Romans came to any considerable strength, the Tuscans received a great
defeat by the Gauls; who under the Command of Bollovesus, either in quest of new quar|ters,
or tempted by the pleasantness of the Country, having passed the Alps, possessed
themselves of that Province called Lombardy, and gave it the name of Gallia Cisalpina;
after which they turn'd out the Natives, settled themselves there, and built several Cities,
which they enjoyed, till in process of time, they also were supplanted by the Romans. And
this was the method of the Tuscans proceeding, and the manner of their confederating
with their Neighbours, which was no less than XII Cities; of which Clusium, Veii, Fe|sulae,
Aretium, and Volterra were the chief; but yet with all their assistance they could not
exceed the limits of Italy, nor indeed conquer all that, for reasons which we shall mention
hereafter. Another way of extending your Empire, is by associating with several Cities,
but so as that the dignity of the Command, the seat of the Empire, and the honour of the
Enterprize may remain with you; which was the way observed by the Romans. The third
is the way of the Spartans and Athenians, who entertained no Confederates, but what
ever Territories they Conquered, they annexed them to their own: which way is undoubt|edly
the worst of the three, as appeared by the two said Republicks, who were ruined upon no
other account, but because they had grasped more Dominion than they were able to hold.
For it is a thing in it self very arduous and difficult, to keep a City in subjection by a con|tinued
force, especially if ever it was free; wherefore unless your Citizens be very nume|rous,
and your associates very considerable, by whose assistance you may be able to keep
what you conquer, it will never be in your power to enlarge your dominion very much,

and the Spartans and Athenians miscarrying in their way, miscarried likewise in their end,
and all their great conquest came to nothing: The Romans took the second way, and
succeeded to that vast and extraordinary power, by associating equally in many things, with
many States, but reserving always to themselves the Seat of the Empire, and the chief
command in their Wars, by which means it came to pass, that their Confederates (ere they
were aware) subjected themselves to the Romans, at the expence of their own labour, and
blood. For after they had carried their Arms out of Italy; reduced several Kingdoms into
Provinces, and the Inhabitants being accustomed to live in subjection, without much diffi|culty
submitted, the Romans bearing the name of the War, and the Nations that were con|quered
knowing nothing of their Allies, submitted to their dominion, and would own no
body else: whereby it happen'd that their associates in Italy being over-powred by the
multitude of provinces which had submitted to the Romans, and by the strength and popu|lousness
of Rome, began to find their error by degrees, but too late, and when they had
no way left to defend themselves; for if any of them conspired, they were quickly sup|pressed,
and made Subjects of Associates. This way of administration, and enlarging
their Empire was peculiar to the Romans; no other people observed it, and certainly no
beter is to be found. The next way of confederating (which was practised by the Tus|cans,
Achaians, and Aetolians in old time, and by the Swizzers of late) is the best way
next to that of the Romans; for though it cannot arrive at any great Empire, the Confede|racy
consisting of so many free Cities, which being all to be consulted, makes their resolu|tions
very tedious, besides, the Citizens are not so vigorous in a War, where the prize is to
be divided into so many parts; yet for these reasons it has two advantages of the third.
First, whatever it gains, it keeps a long time, and loses very hardly; and secondly, it engages
not so rashly in War, but enjoys with more ease and felicity the blessings of peace: for
they are longer in their consultations and debates, where there is to be a general Dyet and
Convention, than where things are to be dispatched within the Walls of one City, Be|sides
experience tells us that this way has certain bounds, which have not been exceeded by
any example we can find. For after XII or XIV Cities have confederated, they admit no
more into the League, as holding themselves enough, and sufficient for their defence, nor
are they much solicitous of extending their Empire, because they are under no necessity of
making themselves stronger; and their conquest would be of little advantage to every par|ticular
State, for they would be forced upon one of these two rocks, either to incorporate
them into their League, and then the multitude would breed confusion, or make them
their Subjects which they will hardly continue: When therefore they are got to such a
number in their association, as that they seem safe against foreign invasion, and strong
enough to defend themselves; They take one of these two ways, either they receive their
Neighbour States or Cities into their protection (by which means they draw vast sums of
Mony sometimes, that are easily distributed) or else they ight for other people, and receive
pay from this or that Prince, as the Swizzers do now, and other Nations have done of
old. To this purpose Titus Livius gives us an account That at a conference betwixt Phi|lip
of Macedon and Titus Quintus Flaminius, an Aetolian Praetor being present, there
happening some words betwixt the said Praetor and King Philip, King Philip reproached
him by the avarice, and inconstancy of his Country, as a people that were not ashamed
to take pay on one side, and send supplies to the other, by which means it was frequently
seen that in both Armies the Aetolian Colours were displayed; from whence we may con|clude
that this way of proceeding by League and Confederacies, has been always the
same, and has had the same effects. The third way of subjecting your conquests and
annexing them to your own dominions, is very incommodious, and instable; and if it
were so to a Commonwealth well constituted and armed, it must needs be much worse
to a Government that is weak, as most of the Italian States are at this day; but the Roman
way is the best, and most to be admired; for there is no example of any body that made
use of it before them, nor has any body imitated them since; and as to the practice of the
Tuscans, and Aetolians in their Confederations, there is no body follows it now a days, but
the Swizzers, and the Suevians: Which being so, and so many brave things performed
by the people of Rome as well for the conservation, as the augmentation of their Empire,
it is not strange our affairs succeeded no better, and that we have been a prey to whoever
would invade us; for (to say nothing of the rest) it has doubtless becom'd the Tuscans if
they could not have imitated the Roman Discipline, nor followed their measures in extend|ing
their Empire, at least to have follow'd the example of their own Ancestors, who
though they brought not their Empire to that Grandeur and immensity as the Romans;
yet they enlarged it as far as they thought good, and as far as consisted with the Nature of
their Government; and by doing so, they kept it a long time, with immortal honour to

their memory, till they were first shaken by the Gauls, and afterwards so totally ruined
by the Romans, that there is scarce the lest token left, that there was ever any such thing;
which having brought it into my mind to consider what may be the causes of this oblivion
of things, I shall discourse of them in the following Chapter.


CHAP. V.
The variation of Religions and Languages, with the accidents of Deluges and
Plagues have been the cause that many great things have been forgotten.
IN my judgment it may be objected to those Philosophers who hold the world to be
Eternal, that if so long a course of antiquity was true, it would be but reasonable
that the memory of some of their affairs should have lasted above five thousand years: yet
there may be some reasons given for that oblivion of things, and they seem twofold,
partly from the Nature of Man, and partly from the influence of the Heavens; the me|mory
of great things are abolished from the nature of Man, by the variation of their Reli|gion,
or Language; for when a new Religion is introduced, the first care of him that
would propagate it, is to explode, and extinguish whatever was memorable in the old,
to give the greater credit to his new innovation; and if it fall out that the introducers of
this new Sect, be of a different language, all goes to wreck, and whatever was before, is
easily forgotten. And that this is so, appears by the institution of the Christian Religion,
whose first establishers did principally intend the cancelling and extirpation of all old
Ethnick Customs, Ceremonies, and Theology; and if there remained any memory of
their affairs, it was because there was no new language introduced with it, the Christians
being constrain'd to explain themselves in Latine; whereas could they have done it in a
new tongue (considering their other persecutions) we may conclude there would have
been no memory left of their Religion or Worship: For so diligent and zealous was Saint
Gregory, and other Moderators of the Christian Religion, in abolishing the superstitions of
the Gentiles, that they caused the works of all the Poets and Historians to be burn'd,
which made any mention of them; they threw down their Images and Idols, and destroy'd
all that might afford the least memory of Paganism; to which diligence of theirs, if a new
language had been added, in a short time all would have been utterly forgotton; what
therefore was done by the Christians for the extirpation of Gentilism, it is not improbable
but the Gentiles might have done of old for the extirpation of the Religion before. And
because in five or six thousand years, Religion may be twice or thrice changed, no wonder
if what was before be so entirely lost, that if there remains any thing of it, it is looked
upon as fabulous and incredible, as it hapned to the Histories of Diodorus Siculus, which
gives an account of 40 or 50000 years, and are not unworthily accounted false. As to
the Coelestial causes from the influence of the Heavens, they are such as destroy mankind in
general, or reduce it to a very small number, as great Mortalities, Famines, and inunda|tions
of Water, but especially the last, because the mischief is more universal, and if any
be saved, it is only the Mountaneers, which being commonly barbarous, have no know|ledge
of antiquity, and by consequence can convey nothing of it to their posterity; and
if it so happens that among them which are preserved, some one man may be more learned
than ordinary, and have some knowledge of affairs, to give himself a name and reputation
afterwards, he conceals, preverts, and transmits them as he pleases; so that there remains
to posterity no more than he thought fit to communicate. Nor do I believe it is doubted
but these accidents happen, and Famine, and Pestilence do sometimes rage in the world,
seeing all Histories mention them, and this oblivion of things is a certain effect of them:
Nor is it unreasonable to think that the great Universe has its way of evacuation, as well
as the Microcosm; for as in that, when the humours are redundant, and the body unable
to digest them, Nature exerts, and finds out some way to throw them off, without which
the person must certainly miscarry; so it is in the other, when all Countries are repleat,
and no room left for those that are to come; when the Cunning and Malignity of man|kind
is at the height, there is a necessity the world should be purged by some of those
three ways, that men being reduced in their numbers, and humbled under the considera|tion
of their Mortality, may (if possible) become better: which being so, no wonder if
the Tuscans formerly so famous for their administration both in War and in Peace, so
eminent for their Courage, and so venerable for their Religion, should be oppressed by
the Romans, and so totally abolished, that (as is said before) there remains nothing of
them but the name.



CHAP. VI.
How the Romans proceeded in making of War.
WE have already discoursed of the way of the Romans in extending their Empire;
we shall now speak of their Customs in the management of their Wars, by which
it will appear with what wisdom they deviated from the common ways of the world, and
by what easie methods they arrived at that Supremacy and Grandeur. He who makes
War at his own choice (and is under no constraint) or else by ambition, has doubtless this
end; To get what he is able, and to keep it whilst he can, and rather to enrich than impo|verish
his own Country: for such a one it is necessary to have regard to his charge, and to
see that neither the conquering nor maintaining are more expensive to him, than will con|sist
with his revenue. This the Romans observed very strictly, by coming strong and sud|denly
into the field; for by that one practice, all their Wars with the Latini, Samnites, and
Tuscans, were dispatched in a short time. And whoever considers their Wars from the
beginning of Rome, to the Siege of the Veientes, will find that they were determined in a
very short time, some in six, some in ten, and some in twenty days. For their Custom
was, upon the first appearance of a War, immediately to draw out their Army, and
seeking out the Enemy, they did what they could to bring him to a Battel; having beaten
him (by reason of the surprize.) The Enemy (that his Country might not wholly be har|rassed)
for the most part proposed an agreement, in which the Romans were sure to insist
upon some part of their Territory; which either they converted to their particular profit,
or consigned to some Colony which was to be placed there for the security of their Fron|tiers;
by which means the wars being ended in a short time, their Conquests were kept
without any considerable expence, for the Colony had that Country for their pay, and the
Romans had their Colonies for their security. Nor could there be any way more advan|tagious
and safe; for whilst there was no enemy in the field, those guards were sufficient;
and when any Army was set out to disturb them, the Romans were always ready with ano|ther
in their defence, and having fought them, they commonly prevailed, forced them to
harder conditions, and returned when they had done: by which means they gained daily
upon the enemy, and grew more powerful at home: and in this manner they proceeded
till their Leaguer before Veii, where they altred their method, and allowed pay to their
Souldiers for the better continuation of the war, whereas before that, their wars being short;
there was no necessity of paying their Armies. Nevertheless, though they paid their Soul|diers
from that time, and maintained war at greater distance, (whereby they were obliged to
continue longer in the field) yet they left not their old custom of dispatching it as soon as
they could, with respect to the circumstances of place and time; for which reason they
continued their Colonies: and besides their old custom of shortning their wars as much as
they were able, the ambition of their Consuls contributed exceedingly; for their Consul|ships
being but for a year, and six months of that to be spent in their employments at
home, they were as diligent and vigorous as possible, because they were not capable of tri|umphing
till the war was concluded: and then for continuing their Colonies; the great ad|vantage
and convenience that resulted from them, was sufficient to prevail. This practice
therefore was observed perpetually among the Romans in the management of their wars;
only they varied something about the distribution of the prey, in which formerly they were
more liberal than in after-times; either because they thought it not so necessary when the
Souldiers were paid; or else because their spoils being greater than before, they thought
convenient that the publick should have its share; that upon any new enterprize they
might not be constrained to lay new taxes upon the people; and by this way their Coffers
were filled in a short time. So that by these two ways, by the distribution of their prey,
and the setling of Colonies, Rome grew rich by its wars, whereas other Princes and States
(without great discretion) grow poor: and so great was every mans ambition of enriching
the Aerarium, that by degrees it came to that pass, no Consul was permitted to triumph, un|less
he returned with a vast quantity of silver or gold, or some other inestimable commodity,
and put it into the treasury. So that the designs of the Romans tended wholly to this, to
finish the war quickly, by forcing the enemy to a Battel; or else to harrass and tire them
with frequent excursions, that thereby compelling them to dishonourable conditions, they
might make their advantage, and become more powerful and rich.



CHAP. VII.
What proportion of Land the Romans allowed to every man in
their Colonies.
I Think it no easie matter to set down the exact proportion of Land, which the Romans
assigned to every single person in their Colonies; for I believe they gave more or less ac|cording
to the barrenness or fertility of the soil; and that in all places they were sparing
enough. And the first reason that induces me, is, that thereby they might send more men
and by consequence their frontiers be better guarded: another is, because living at home in|digent
themselves, it is not to be supposed they would suffer those whom they sent abroad
to grow too opulent and rich: and in this I'am much confirm'd by Livy, where he tells us
that upon the taking of Veii, the Romans sent a Colony thither, and in the distribution of
the Land allotted every man no more than three acres, and a little more according to our
measure.
They might consider likewise that their wants would not be supplyed by the quantity
so much as the improvement and cultivation of their Land. Yet I do not doubt but they
had publick Pastures and Woods to sustain their Cattel, and supply themselves with firing,
without which a Colony could hardly subsist.


CHAP. VIII.
What it is that disposes some people to leave their native Countries, to
dispossess other people.
SEeing I have spoken already of the Military Discipline of the Romans; and how the
Tuscans were invaded by the French; it follows properly enough that we say some|thing
of their several kinds of War, which are two: one sort of commenced upon the am|bition
of some Prince or commonwealth, in hopes to extend, and enlarge his Empire;
as those wars which were made by Alexander the Great, by the Romans, and by one Prince
against another: which wars, though dangerous, are not yet so pernicious as to supplant
the inhabitants, and drive them out of their Country; for the Conqueror contents him|self
with his Victory, and the submission of the people allows them their own Laws, and
many times their Estates. The other kind of war is much more dangerous and destru|ctive,
and that is when an entire Nation with their Wives and their Children, compelled
either by hunger, or war, leaves its own Country, to fix themselves somewhere else, not to
extend their dominion, or exercise any authority, (as in the other) but to kill or expel all
the Natives, and possess themselves of their Estates.
This war indeed is most bloody and dreadful, as Salust shews very well in the end of his
Bellum Iugurthinum, where, after Iugurtha was beaten, speaking of the invasion of the Gauls
he tells us, Cum caeteris Gentibus a populo Romano de imperio tantum fuisse dimicatum, cum
Gallis, de singulorum hominum salute; With other Nations the Romans fought only for Em|pire
and Dominion, with the Gauls they fought for their Country and Lives. For when a
Prince or Commonwealth invades a Country according to the first way, it is sufficient, if
those who are at the Helm be removed or destroyed; in this every mans life is in danger;
for when a whole Nation transplants, and invades a new Province, not only the Colonies,
but the Natives must be extinguished, that they may fix themselves upon their Lands, and
possess themselves of their Goods: and by these kind of people the Romans were three
times invaded. First by the Gauls, who took Rome, and (as I said before) drove the Tuscans
out of Lombardy; of which invasion Titus Livius gives two reasons: one was the pleasant|ness
of the Country, and the delicacy of the Wine, wherewith (being then but ill provi|ded
in France) they were infinitely taken: the other was, the Country was grown so ex|ceedingly
populous, that it was not able to sustain its own natives; whereupon the Princes
of those parts judging it necessary to find them new quarters they appointed which were
to transplant, and putting Bellovesus and Sicovesus (two French Princes) at the head of them
they sent one part of them into Italy, and the other into Spain: it was Bellovesus lot to in|vade
Italy, and he did it so effectually, that he possessed himself of all Lombardy, and made
the first war upon the Romans that was ever made upon them by the French. The second

time they were invaded in this manner was likewise by the French, and it was after the first
Punic war, in which invasion the Gauls lost above 200000 men betwixt Pisa and Piombino:
the third and last was by the Germans and Cimbrians, who having defeated several Armies
of the Romans, were at last themselves defeated by Marius. From whence we may ob|serve
the great courage and constancy of the Romans of old, that could not only bear up
against three such dangerous invasions, but overcome them at last; whereas afterwards their
courage began to fail, and they were not able to resist the inundation of those Barbarians;
for when the Goths and the Vandals invaded, they possessed themselves of the whole
Western Empire, without any considerable opposition. The reasons which move these
Nations to transmigrate (as I said before) is necessity, and that necessity proceeds either from
famine, or from wars and disturbances at home; and when they undertake these Expedi|tions
with vast and innumerable numbers, they invade with irresistible violence, put all the
Natives to the sword; possess themselves of their Estates; establish a new Kingdom, and
change the very name of the Province, as Moses did of old, and the Barbarians since, who
possessed themselves of the Roman Empire.
From hence are all the new names in Italy and elsewhere imposed by their several Con|querors:
Lombardy was called anciently Gallia Cisalpina, Francia (from the Franks) was
called anciently Gallia trans Alpina, Sclavonia was called Illyria, Hungaria, Pannonia, An|glia,
Britannta; Moses gave the name of Iudea to that part of Syria which he conquered,
and many other Countries have changed their names upon the same occasion, which would
be too long to recount. And because I have said before, that sometimes these kind of peo|ple
are forc'd out of their Country by intestine troubles and disturbances, I shall present you
with one example of the Maurusians an ancient people of Syria, who foreseeing the invasion
of the Hebrews, and knowing themselves unable to oppose them, thought it more wisdom
to forsake their Country betimes, and preserve themselves, than to expect their coming,
and lose both; whereupon they pack'd up their goods, and with their wives and children
removed into Africk, where they drove out the inhabitants, and setled in their Country:
so that they who were too weak to defend their own Province, were strong enough to force
out another people. To this purpose Prooopius who writes the wars of Bellisarius against
the Vandals (who had setled themselves in Africk) tells us, that upon certain pillars in the
houses where these Maurusians had lived, he himself read these words, Nos Maurusii qui
fugimus a facie Iesu latronis filii Navae; We Maurisians fled hither from Iesus the Usurper,
who was the son of Navi. By which we may perceive the occasion of their departure out
of Syria. And certainly these Nations forc'd out of their own Country by irresistible ne|cessity,
are more than ordinarily dreadful, and not to be opposed but by a potent and well
disciplin'd people: but when they move in small numbers, their danger is not so great, be|cause
they dare not use that violence, but are put to their wits, and to possess themselves of
some quarters by cunning and insinuation, which they are to keep afterwards by ways of
amity and friendship, as Aeneas did, and Dido, the Massilians and others, who by the as|sistance
and friendship of their neighbours, made good what they had possessed. But the
people that came out of their own Countries the most numerous and strong, were the Scy|thians;
for their Country being barren and cold, and the natives too numerous to be su|stained
in it, they were forced abroad, as having nothing to preserve them at home. And
if now for five hundred years and upwards we have not heard of any such transmigration,
I conceive the reasons may be several: the first may be the great evacuation in those Coun|tries,
from whence the Roman Empire was invaded. A second may be, because Germany
and Hungaria (from whence those inundations came) is better cultivated and improved, so
as they can live plentifully at home, without rambling abroad: another reason may be,
that the Germans, Poles, Cimbrians, and other Nations which border upon the Scythians,
being martial people, and continually at wars with them, are as it were a Bulwark to these
parts, and keep the Scythians from all new invasions. The Tartars likewise have been many
times upon their march with very great Armies, but they have been always encountred and
repulsed by the Poles and Hungarians, which has given them occasion frequently to boast,
that were it not for their arms and resistance, not only Italy, but the very Roman Church
had been many times sensible of the barbarity of the Tartars.



CHAP. IX.
What those occasions are which do most commonly create War among Princes.
THe occasion of the War betwixt the Samnites and the Romans, who had been a long
time in league together, was the common cause betwixt all Princes and Governments,
and was either fortuitous, or designed. The war betwixt the Samnites and the Romans
was fortuitous; for when the Samnites made war upon the Sidicins, and afterwards upon
the Campani, they intended not any controversy with the Romans; but the Campani being
beaten, and betaking themselves to the Romans for relief, (contrary to the expectation both
of the Romans and Samnites) the Romans being in league with the Samnites, could not,
without violence to the said league, give them protection; upon which (having no other
way to secure themselves) the Campani submitted to the Romans, and made themselves their
subjects; and the Romans, how unjust soever they thought it before to assist the Campani
(whilst they were but associates) against the Samnites, their old friends, yet now they were
become their subjects, and had incorporated with their State, the case was altred, and they
thought it very reasonable, supposing, that if they should refuse to defend them, they
should discourage all others that had an inclination to do the like, which would have been
contrary to the great design of the Romans to propagate their Glory and Empire. The
same accidental cause gave occasion to their first War with the Carthaginians, upon the
Romans protecting the Massinenses in Sicily. But their second war with the Carthaginians,
was designed; for Hanibal the Carthaginian General fell upon the Saguntins in Spain, (who
were in alliance with the Romans) not so much out of malice to the Saguntins, but that
the Romans being provoked to their defence, should give the Carthaginians occasion to
transport the war into Italy.
This way of provoking and hedging in a War has been always practised among Poten|tates,
especially where they had any faith or respect for other people; for, that the peace
which has been a long time betwixt them upon articles of alliance may seem firm and in|violate,
they will not meddle with him against whom they do principally design, but turn
their arms upon some of his friends and confederates that he is most particularly obliged to
receive into his protection, knowing, that if he appears in their defence, they must have oc|casion
to fight him; if he does not, but disowns his allies, they publish his weakness and
infidelity to the World, and by either of those ways they do their business. This example
of the Campani is of singular importance, as well to those who would make war upon any
body, as those that are in distress; for when you are unable to defend your self, and unwil|ling
to fall into their hands that invade you, the best and most safe way is to put your self in
subjection to some neighbouring Prince, as the Campani did then, and the Florentines af|terward
when they found themselves too weak to support against the power of Castruccio
of Lucca; for finding that Robert King of Naples would not protect them as friends, they
threw themselves into his arms to be defended as his subjects.


CHAP. X.
That, according to the common opinion, mony is not the sinews of War.
BEcause it is easie to begin war as a man pleases, but harder to end it; every Prince be|fore
he undertakes an enterprize is obliged to consider his own strength well, and to re|gulate
by it. But then he must be so wise too as not to make a wrong judgment, and that
he will certainly do as oft as he computes it by his Bags, by the situation of his Towns, or
the affection of his Friends, rather than by his own proper Power and Arms. Mony, and
Towns, and Friends are all good, when in conjunction with a strong Army of your own,
but without it they do nothing: without Men, to what purpose is either Mony or Towns?
and the affection of your subjects will hold no longer than you are able to defend them.
There is no mountain, no lake, no streight inaccessible, where there is no force to defend it.
Vast sums of mony are not only incapable of protecting you, but they expose you to more
danger; nor can any thing be more false than that old and common saying, That mony is the
sinews of the war: Quintus Curtius was the first author of it in the war betwixt Antipater
of Macedon, and the King of Sparta, where he tells us, that for want of monies the Spar|tans

were forced to fight, and were beaten; whereas, could they have protracted but some
few days, they had had the news of Alexander's death, and got the victory without fighting
a blow; but wanting mony, and apprehending their Army would moulder, they were con|strained
to come to a Battel, and were defeated; which was the occasion of that A|pophthegm,
That mony is the sinews of war: which saying is now a-days in every Princes
mouth, but improperly, in my judgment: for relying wholly upon that Maxim, they think
their treasure is sufficient to defend them, not considering that, if that would have done it,
Darius would have conquered Alexander; the Grecians the Romans; Duke Charles the
Swizzers: and of late the Pope and Florentines united, would not have found it so hard
to have mastered Francesco Maria (Nephew to Iulius 2d.) at the Battel of Urbin. But
these whom I have mentioned, presuming more upon the multitude of their bags than
the goodness of their men, were all beaten and overcome. Craesus the King of Lydia car|rying
Solon into his Treasury, and shewing him an immense quantity of riches, ask'd him
what he thought of his power; to which Solon replyed, I think it never the greater for
this; for War is carried on, and Battels are fought more with iron than gold; and it
might happen for ought he knew, that some body might come with his iron and take it all
from him. Again, when after the death of Alexander the Great, a great Army of Gauls
transplanted into Greece, (from whence they passed afterwards into Asia) before they be|gan
their march, the Gauls sent Embassadors to the King of Macedon to treat an accord;
which being almost concluded, to make the Embassadors more plyable, the said King shews
them his treasure, which consisted of a vast quantity of silver and gold, which the Embas|sadors
had no sooner seen, but longing impatiently to be at it, they broke of the treaty,
and brought their Army into his Country; so that that very thing in which he had re|posed
his great confidence and security proved his ruine and destruction. The Venetians
not long since had their Coffers well stor'd, yet they lost all, and their wealth was not able
to defend them. So that I do affirm 'tis not mony, (as the common opinion will have it)
but good Souldiers that is the sinews of war: for mony cannot find good Souldiers, but
good Souldiers will be sure to find mony; had not the Romans done more in their wars
with their iron than their gold, the treasure of the whole World would not have been suf|ficient
for them, considering their great enterprizes abroad, and their no less difficulties at
home; but fighting with iron, they had no want of gold, for those who were afraid of
their Armies supplyed them. And if the King of Sparta was forced to run the hazard of
a Battel, and was beaten for want of monies, it was no more than what has hapned to
others, and might have hapned to him upon other occasions: for it falls out of many times
that for want of provisions an Army is forc'd either to fight or to starve; in which case
there is no General so weak but he will choose that which is most honourable, where for|tune
has some power to befriend him. Again, a General having news of supplies that
are coming to the enemy, considers with himself whether he had not better engage them as
they are, than attend till their recruits come up, and then fight them with more disadvan|tage:
sometimes likewise it falls out, (as it did to Asdrubal in the Country of the Piseni,
when he was surprized by Claudius Nero, and the other Roman Consul) that a General is
either forc'd to fight or to fly, in which case it is incomparably more safe to hazard all in a
Battel, than to lose all in a Flight. Which being so, we see there are many causes that con|strain
a General to fight upon disadvantage; among which, if want of mony be one, there
is no more reason we should therefore call that the sinews of war, than any of the rest which
do the same thing: so that mony is not so much the snews of war, as good souldiers:
'tis true, mony is requisite for the carrying on of a war, but not principally, and in the first
place; for good souldiers have many times been contented without it, though it is but
seldom they want it, for 'tis as impossible for good souldiers to want mony, as it is for mony
alone to make good souldiers. And this is clear by the testimony of Historians in a thou|sand
places. Pericles persuaded the Athenians to a war with all Peloponnesus, and assured
them of success, upon consideration of their industry and riches; the Athenians undertook
the War, and for some time prospered with their industry, but at last it appeared that the
conduct and discipline of the Spartans was too hard for the Athenians industry and treasure.
Livy desides this controversie the best of any man, where, in his comparison of Comman|ders,
enquiring what would have been the event if Alexander the Great had turn'd his
Arms against the Romans, he declares that in war there are three things fundamentally ne|cessary,
good Souldiers, good Officers, and good fortune; and then arguing whether Alex|ander
or the Romans were more considerable in those three points, he concludes, without the
least mention of mony. It is not improbable but the Campani, (of whom we have spoken in
the former Chapter) when they undertook the assistance of the Sidicins against the Samnites
measured their power more by their mony than their men; from whence it hapned that'

being defeated in two Battels, they were forced to submit, and become tributary to the
Romans.


CHAP. XI.
'Tis not discretion to enter into strict amity with a Prince, whose reputation is
greater than his strength.
THe Sidicins were in a great error to desire the assistance of the Campani against the
Samnites, as being (by reason of their luxury) unable to assist them, but the error
of the Capuans was greater, in not knowing their own weakness and incapacity to defend
them: both their errors Livy has very well described in these words, Campani magis nomen
in auxilium Sidicinorum, quam vires ad praesidium attulerunt; The Capuans made a great
noise, but they brought no force to the relief of the Sidicins.
And here it is not unseasonable to consider, that the leagues which are made with Prin|ces
whose distance is too great, or power too little to relieve one, are more honourable than
safe, and give more reputation than security to the person that desires them. This was
experienced by the Florentines in the year 1489, when the Pope and King of Naples in|vaded
them; for they were at that time confederate with the King of France, yet they
had more reputation than assistance thereby. The same would happen likewise to such
of the Italian Princes as should confederate with Maximilian the Emperor, and in confi|dence
of his alliance, undertake any great enterprize, because that alliance would be one of
those that bring more reputation than relief. So then, as it was a great error in the Ca|puans,
when they were unable to defend themselves, to undertake the protection of the
Sidicins, so it is and will be the same in whoever follows their example. It was the same
case with the Tarentini, who would needs interpose betwixt the Samnites and the Ro|mans,
to mediate a peace: for when both Romans and Samnites were in the field, and their
Armies preparing for an engagement, the Tarentini sent Embassadors to the Consul, to let
him know from the Senate of the Tarentini, that they would have peace betwixt them and
the Samnites, and that they were resolved to take Arms against them which refused it. But
the Consul smiling at their imprudence, in the presence of the said Embassadors, caused a
charge to be sounded, and immediately marching his Army against the enemy, he let them
see by his proceedings what answer they deserved.
Thus you have seen to what errors Princes are subject, who undertake the protection of
other States; I shall now in the next Chapter remonstrate what ways are most convenient
for their own proper defence.


CHAP. XII.
Vpon an apprehension of being invaded, whether it be better to make war,
or expect it.
AMong wise men, and very good Souldiers, I have heard it often disputed, whether
when two Princes are of equal strength, and one of them designing war (visibly)
against the other) it be better for that Prince which is like to be invaded, to sit still, and
expect him at home; or to begin with him, and make the first inroad himself? There are
arguments on both sides, and they who think it best to be the aggressor, and fall upon the
Enemy first, may alledge the Counsel which Craesus gave to Cyrus, when being with his Ar|my
upon the Frontiers of the Massageti, Thamyris Queen of that Country sent to him to
take his choice whether she should fight him within her Country, or upon the Frontiers:
if he desired to advance, she would stand still and expect him; if he had rather fight where
he was, she would be with him immediately: when it came to be debated in Counsel,
Craesus, contrary to the opinion of the rest, was for marching to her; and the reason he
gave, was, because if she should be beaten at any distance, Cyrus would get but little of her
Country, for she would have time to recruit, whereas, if she were beaten at home, he
would be able to sit so close upon her skirts, that she being never capable of rallying, or
bringing another Army into the field, must of necessity lose her whole Kingdom: Hanibal
gave the same Counsel to Antiochus, assuring him that if the Romans were any way to be

conquered, it was by carrying the war into Italy, for by so doing he might have the benefit
of their Arms, their Wealth, and their Allies; but whilst the war was abroad, and Italy
undisturbed, he would leave the man inexhaustible magazine that would supply them with
what and wheresoever they had occasion; and at last Hanibal concluded that Rome was to
be taken more easily than the Empire, and Italy it self, than any of its Provinces. Aga|thocles
being unable to resist the Carthaginians at home, invaded their borders, and forc'd
them to a peace; and Scipio in the same manner to remove the war out of Italy, transpor|ted
it into Africk. Those who are on the other side do argue as stifly, that there can be
nothing more dangerous than to hazard an Army in an enemies Country, at a great distance
from their own; and they produce the Athenians for an instance, who, whilst they kept
themselves upon the defensive part, and expected their enemies at home were always vi|ctorious;
but when they began to make war at a distance, and send Armies into Sicily
they lost their liberty, and everything else. They produce also the Fable of Antius King
of Lybia, who being invaded by Hercules the Egyptian, was invincible whilst he kept him|self
within his own borders but being inveigled out by the subtility of his enemy, he lost
both his Kingdom and Life; upon which occasion that story was raised of Antius; that
being born of the earth, (as they pretended) so oft as he touch'd it, so oft he received new
vigour from his Mother, which Hercules perceiving, got him up in his arms, crush'd
him to death.
They produce likewise more modern examples. Every body knows that Ferrand King of
Naples was esteemed a wise Prince in his time, and hearing two years before his death that
King Charles viii of France was preparing to invade him, he let him alone; but falling sick
afterwards, as he lay upon his death-bed, he called his Son Alphonso to him, and among
other things, charged him that he should expect the King of France upon his Frontiers,
and fight him there, but that by no means he should be tempted beyond them; and it had
been better for Alphonso to have follow'd his Counsel, for neglecting it afterwards, and
sending an Army into Romagna he lost both Army and Kingdom without striking a blow:
But besides these arguments on both sides, it is urged in behalf of the Aggressor, that he
invades with more confidence and courage than his Adversary receives him (which is a
great advantage and enhancement to his Army) That he brings many inconveniences upon
the person whom he invades, to which he would not be liable, if he expected him at home.
For when the enemies Country is wasted, and their Houses plunder'd, his Subjects are not
much to be trusted, nor can any more Taxes be laid upon them, without great difficulty,
by which means (as Hanibal said) their Magazines will be spent and their fountain
dryed up that was to supply them with all Provisions for War. Besides, if your Army be
in the Enemies Country, it will be under a greater necessity of fighting, and by consequence
will fight more desperately than at home. But to this it is answered on the other side, That
it is more for your advantage to attend your enemy in your own Country, than to seek him
abroad; for thereby you may furnish your self with Victuals and Amunition, and all other
necessaries without any inconvenience, and distress him by driving the Country. You may
likewise with much more ease incommode and frustrate his designs, by your better know|ledge
of the Country, and what places are more proper to attack him in; as also you may
attack him with your whole force at once, or give him battel as you please, which out of
your own Confines is not to be done: Moreover if Fortune should be adverse, and it be
your chance to be beaten; more of your Men will escape where their refuge is so near, and
you will sooner rally them again: In short, if you fight at home, you venture your
whole force, and not your whole fortune: but if you fight abroad, you venture your
whole fortune with but part of your force: Others there have been, who with design
to weaken the Enemy, and fighting him afterwards with more ease and advantage, have
suffered him quietly to march several days Journey into their Country, and possess himself
of several Towns; but whether they did well or not, I will not determine, only I think
this distinction is to be considered, whether my Country be strong in Fortresses, and Men;
as the Romans were of old, and as the Swizzers at this day; or whether it be weak and
unfortified, as the Territory of the Carthaginians formerly, and France and Italy now.
In this case the Enemy is by all means to be kept at a distance, because your chief strength
lying in your Mony, and not in your Men, whenever you are interrupted in raising or re+ceiving
of that, your business is done; and nothing interrupts you so fatally, as an Ene|my
in your Country. And of this the Carthaginians may be an example, who whilst
they were free at home, were able by their Revenue and Taxes to wage War with the Ro|mans
themselves; whereas afterwards when they were assaulted, they were not able to
contend with Agathocles. The Florentines, when Castruccio of Lucca brought his Arms
into their Country, could not support against him, but were forced to put themselves un|der

the Dominion of the King of Naples, to procure his protection; but Castruccio was
no sooner dead, but they were agog again, and had the confidence to invade the Duke of
Milan, and to attempt the beating him out of that Province; so couragious were they in
their foreign War, and so abject at home. But when Countries are in a posture of defence,
and people Martial and well disciplin'd (as the Romans of old, and the Swizzers at this
day) 'tis better to keep off; for the nearer they are to their own Country, they are the
harder to overcome, because they can raise more force to defend themselves, than to invade
another people. Nor does the opinion of Hanibal affect me at all; for though he persua|ded
Antiochus to pass into Italy he did it as a thing that would have been more for his
own, and the Carthaginian than for Antiochus his advantage; for had the Romans received
those three great defeats which they received of Hanibal in Italy, in the same space of time,
in France or any where else, they had been ruined irrecoverably, for they could neither
have rallyed, nor recruited so soon. I do not remember any foreign Expedition by the
Romans for the Conquest of any Province, in which their Army exceeded the number of
50000. But upon the invasion of the Gauls, after the first Punick war, they brought 118000
Men into the Field for their defence: Nor could they beat them afterwards in Lombardy,
as they did at first in Tuscany, because it was more remote, and they could not fight them
with so much convenience, nor with so many men. The Cimbri repulsed the Romans in
Germany, but following them into Italy, they were defeated, and driven out again them|selves;
and the reason was, because the Romans could bring more forces against them: The
Swizzers may without much difficulty be over-powered abroad, because they seldom march
above 30 or 40000 strong; but to attack and beat them at home, is much more difficult,
where they can bring into the field 100000 and more. I conclude therefore that that
Prince whose people are in a posture, and provided for War, does wisely if he expects a
Potent and dangerous Enemy at home, rather than to invade him in his own Country:
But that Prince whose Country is ill provided, and whose Subjects are ill disciplined, does
better if he keeps the War as far off as he can: and by so doing, each of them (in his several
degree) will defend himself best.


CHAP. XIII.
That from mean to great fortune people rise rather by fraud
than by force.
I Have found it always true, that men do seldom or never advance themselves from a small
beginning, to any great height, but by fraud, or by force (unless they come by it by
donation, or right of inheritance). I do not think any instance is to be found where force
alone brought any man to that Grandeur, but fraud and artifice have done it many times,
as is clear in the lives of Philip of Macedon, Agathocles the Sicilian, and several others,
who from mean and inconsiderable extraction, came at length to be Kings. Xenophon in
his History of Cyrus insinuates the necessity of fraud when he represents (in his first Expe|dition
against the King of Armenia) how all Cyrus his actions and negotiations were full
of fallacy and deceit, and that it was that way he conquered his Kingdom, and not by
bravery and force, by which he implyes that no Prince can do any great matters without
that art of dissembling Besides he represents him jugling, and playing of tricks with
his own Unckle by the Mother-side, the King of the Medes, and shows that without that
excellence, he had never been King; and indeed I am of opinion that from a mean and
base fortune never any man came to be very great by down-right generosity and force; but
by fraud alone there have been many, as particularly Iohn Galeazzo, who by that alone
wrested the Government of Lombardy out of the hands of Messer Bernardo, his Unckle.
And the same courses which Princes are forced to in the beginning of their authority, the
same courses are taken by Commonwealths at first, till they be settled in their government,
and have force sufficient to defend themselves. Rome (which either by change or election
took all ways to make it self great) was not without this; and what greater cunning or
artifice could it use in the beginning of its greatness, than what it did take, and is men|tioned
before. For by their fair carriage and insinuation, they got several Cities into con|sideration,
and under that name, they subjected them insensibly, and made them their
slaves. The Latins, and other Neigbouring, people were of this sort, by whose Arms
and Alliance, the Romans having conquered their Enemies, they were rendered so powerful
that they began to handle them now, not as Associates, but Subjects; nor could the Latini

be convinced of their servitude, till they saw the Samnites twice over-thrown, and forced
to accept of their Conditions. Which Victories, though they gain'd the Romans great
reputation abroad, among remote Princes, who understood more of the name, than the
power of the Romans, yet they created envy and jealousie among those who were nearer and
more sensible of their greatness; and this jealousie and apprehension was so great, that not
only the Latins, but the Colonies in Latium and Campagnia (which had been sent thither
not long before) confederated against the Romans, and resolved to make War upon them.
And this War was commenced in the same manner (as I have said before) most other
Wars are commenced. Not by down-right denunciation of War against the Romans, but
by defending the Sidicins against the Samnites, who made War by allowance from the
Romans. Nor was there any other reason of their Conspiracy, but because the Confe|rates
began to smell out their cunning, and to be sensible that under that false title of Allies,
they were in great danger of being made slaves, which Annius Selinus (a Latin Praetor) in
an Oration to the Counsel expressed very properly in these words, Nam si etiam nunc sub
umbra faederis aequi, servitutem pati possumus, quid obest quin proditis Sidicinis, non Ro|manorum
solum, sed Samnitium dictis pareamus? For if even now under the shadow of an
equal Confederacy, we can endure servitude: What hinders but that we betray the Sidicins,
and put our necks under the feet not only of the Romans, but the Samnites. Which things
being so, it is manifest the Romans wanted not at the beginning of their rise, that dexterity
of cheating that is so necessary to all people that are ambitious of raising themselves to a
great height, from an inconsiderable beginning; which artifice is always the less scandalous,
by how much he that does practise it, understands better how to disguise it by some hono|rable
pretence, as the Romans did very well.


CHAP. XIV.
Many People are mistaken, who expect with meekness and humility
to work upon the proud.
IT falls out many times that humility and modesty towards such as have any picque or
prejudice to you, is so far from doing good, that it does a great deal of mischief and
of this the debate and consultation of the Romans about the preservation of their peace
with the Latins, is an example, from whom they were in expectation of a War. For the
Samnites complaining to the Romans that the Latins had invaded them, the Romans (un|willing
to exasperate them more, who were already too prone to be quarrelling) return'd
this answer, that by their league with them, the Latins were not tyed up from making
War as they pleas'd. The Latins were so far from being satisfied by the mildness of their
answer, that it made them more insolent; insomuch that not long after they profess'd
themselves their Enemies, as appears by that speech of the aforesaid Annius in the Council
aforesaid, where he tells the Latins, Tentstis patientiam negando militem: Quis dubitat
exarsisse eos? Pertulerunt tamen hunc dolorem. Exercitus nos parare adversus Samnites foe|deratos
suos audirunt, nec moverunt se ab urbe. Unde haec illis tanta modestia, nisi a con|scientia
virium,  nostrarum,  suarum. You tried their patience before, in refusing them
supplies; who doubts but they were netled? yet they swallow'd it: They had notice of our
preparations against the Samnites their Confederates, and stirred not in their defence. Whence
comes this mighty modesty, and good nature? from nothing but a sence of the disparity betwixt
our strength, and their own. From hence it is clear, the patience and civility of the Romans,
augmented the arrogance of the Latins: and that it is the interest of all Princes to be very
cautious of condescending from their dignity, or stooping willingly to any thing that may
give the Enemy an opinion of his weakness or pusillanimity; for it is better to lose any
thing bravely and by open War, than to part with it poorly in hopes to prevent it; and it
many times happens that those who part so easily with their Lands or Monies to prevent a
War, do rather excite, than satisfie the Enemy, whose nature commonly is such, that upon
the discovery of their impotence or fear, his desires encrease, and new things are succes|sively
demanded; nor will your friends be so ready to assist, if they find you timorous and
irresolute. But if as soon as you have notice of the designs or insolence of the Enemy,
you immediately prepare to correct him; he will not invade you so boldly, though he be
stronger than you, and then your friends will come in more freely to your assistance,
who, had you abandoned your self, would certainly have forsaken you. This is intended
only where you have but one Enemy; where you have more, the best way is to give

and promise what you think fit, that if possible, you may draw off some or other
of them from their Confederacy, and so break their League by dividing them.


CHAP. XV.
Weak States are irresolute and uncertain in their Councils, and slow
Councils are most commonly pernicious.
FRom these occasions and beginnings of the War betwixt the Latins and the Romans,
we may observe, that in all consultations, it is best to come immediately to the point
in question, and bring things to a result, without too tedious an hesitation and suspence.
And this we may learn from the Council which the said Latins took at that time when their
war with the Romans was in debate. For the Romans, suspecting the defection of the Latins,
for their better information, and that they might reduce them (if possible) without blows,
sent to them to send over eight of their Principal Citizens to Rome, to consult with them
about keeping of the Peace. The Latins being conscious to themselves of many things
which they had acted against the pleasure of the Romans, call'd a Council to consider of the
persons that were to go, and what their Comissioners should say when they came there.
The Council being divided, one man proposing one thing, and another man another, An|nius
the Praetor had this expression, Ad summam rerum nostrarum pertinere arbitror, ut cogi|tetis
magis, quid agendum nobis, quam quid loquendum sit, facile erit explicatis Consiliis,
accommodare rebus verba. I conceive it more pertinent to our business, That you consider rather
what is to be done, than what is to be said; for when you are come to a resolution, it will be no
hard matter to accomodate your words. Which saying was doubtlesly true, and ought to be
regarded by all Princes and Commonwealths. For whilst we are ambiguous, and uncer|tain
what is to be done, we cannot tell how to adapt and accommodate our language; but
when we are come to a resolution, and have decreed what is to be done, it is not so diffi|cult.
I have inserted this passage the more willingly, because I my self have known this
irresolution do much mischief, to the detriment and dishonour of our State; and it is a
fault peculiar to all weak and improvident Princes and Governments to be slow and tedious,
as well as uncertain in their Councils, which is as dangerous as the other, especially when
the debate is about the relief or protection of a friend; for your slowness does no good to
him, and exposes your self. These uncertain or tedious resolutions proceed either from
want of courage and force, or from the crossness and malevolence of the Counsellors, who
carried away by some private passion of their own, will rather ruine the State, than not
accomplish their revenge, so that instead of expediting and pushing things to a conclusion,
they impede and obstruct whatever is before them. For your good Citizens (though the
vogue of the people runs the more dangerous way) will never hinder the coming to a
result, especially in things that will not dispense with much time. Girolamo a Tyrant in
Syracuse being dead, and the War betwixt the Romans and Carthaginians very hot, a
Council was called by the Syracusans, and it was debated which side they should take. The
question was canvas'd with such order by both parties, that it remained in ambiguo, and
nothing was resolved, till at length Appolonides (one of the Principal in that City) in a
grave and prudent Oration remonstrated, That neither they were to be blamed who had
spoken for the Romans, nor they who adhered to the Carthaginians, but the length and
uncertainty of their debate; for that irresolution would be the occasion of certain ruine;
but if they came to a conclusion, with which side soever they joyn'd, they might hope
for some good. Titus Livius could not better have displayed the danger of this kind of
suspence, than in this case of the Latins; whose assistance against the Romans being desired
by the Lavinians, they were so long in their debate, that when at last they came to a reso|lution,
their supplies were scarce gone out of their Gates, before they had news that their
Confederates were beaten. Whereupon Milonius the Praetor said very wittily, This little
ground which we have marched, will cost us very dear to the Romans; and this hapned to
them for the tediousness of their Councils; for they should either have assisted, or denyed
them out of hand; had they denyed them, the Romans had not been disgusted; had they
complyed, they might have supported their Associates, and have kept them from being
ruined; but doing neither, they destroyed their friends, and hazarded themselves. Had
this precept of bringing things to a speedy resolution, been followed by the Florentines,
they had prevented many mischiefs and damages which they met withal upon the coming

of Lewis XII into Italy against the Duke of Milan; for the said King Lewis having resol|ved
upon the said expedition, he proposed to their Embassadors in his Court, that the
Florentines should not interpose or concern themselves in the quarrel, upon which terms,
he would receive them into his protection, and defend them from any harm; the Embas|sadors
agreed, and a Months time was allowed for ratification from the City. But the
ratification was deferred (by the imprudence of some persons who favoured the Duke of
Milan's interest) till the French had almost conquered all, and being offered then, it was
refused by the King of France (who knew well enough that the Florcntines were then
forced to what they did; and desired his amity more out of fear, than affection) which
piece of delay cost the Florentines a good round Sum of Mony, and might well have
been their ruine; as just such an accident was afterward. And this indiscretion of theirs
was the greater, because they were no way serviceable to the Duke of Milan; who, if he
had prevailed, would doubtless have shown himself a greater Enemy to them, than the
King of France. Of this slowness, and uncertainly of Councils, I have spoken before,
but new occasion presenting it self, I have discoursed of it again, as a thing worthy the
observation of all Commonwealths, especially like ours.


CHAP. XVI.
How much the Soldiers of our times do differ from the Discipline
of the Ancients.
THe Battel which the Romans fought with the Latins, in the Consulships of Manlius
Torquatus, and Decius, was the greatest and most important that ever they had
in any War, with any other Nation. For as the Latins lost all by losing the Victo|ry,
and the Romans got the Dominion of them: So the Romans had they lost the Battel,
must have lost their liberty with it, and turn'd Subjects to the Latins. Livy tells us the
same thing, for (says he) the Latin Army was in nothing inferiour to the Romans; their
courage the same, their constancy the same, and their numbers the same; if the Romans
had any advantage, it was in their Generals, which indeed were better than the Latins, and
it is expressed by several, both Latins and Romans who have left an account of that Battel
to posterity; that where-ever Manlius had been, that side would certainly have conquered.
In this Battel there were two things very exemplary and remarkable: One of the Consuls,
to keep his Souldiers firm in their obedience, and preserve their Military Discipline, caused
his own Son to be slain for transgressing his Orders, though he gain'd the Victory by the
means. The other devoted himself freely to death, for the good of his Country; for the
dispute was like to be very hard, fighting against the Latins, who (as Livy tells us) had the
same Language, the same Customs, the same Arms, the same Discipline with the Romans;
the Soldiers, the Captains, the Tribunes both in one Army and the other, had been Come|rades
and served formerly together, not only in the same Army, or Garison, but in the same
Company and Band. It was necessary therefore, being equal in their numbers, and equal
in their courage, that something extraordinary should be done, that might render the Sol|diers
fiercer, and more obstinate to overcome, upon which fierceness and obstinacy the
whole hopes of the victory did depend; for whilst there is any such in the breasts of the
Soldiers, they never think of running, but press still on for victory and prize; and be|cause
there was more of this constancy and fortitude in the breasts of the Romans, than in
the breasts of the Latins, partly the destiny, and partly the bravery of the Consuls effected
that for the good success of their Army, and the preservation of their Discipline, Torquatus
killed his Son, and Decius himself. Titus Livius in his description of the equality of their
force, gives us an exact account of the Orders which they observed in their Armies and
Fights, and he has done it so largely, I need not repeat it all, but shall only select what I
think most particularly remarkable, and what, if observed by the Generals of our days, might
have prevented very great disorders. I say then that according to Livy's description, their
Armies were divided into three principal Schieri or Squadrons. The first consisted of their
Hastati, which were most of them young men in the flower of their age digested into Ma|nipuli
or small parties, and disposed at a certain distance with Pikes or Darts in their hands,
from whence they were called Hastati. The second Squadron was as numerous as the first,
and divided into as many Manipuli, but their distance was something greater, and it con|sisted
of choice men, from whence they were called Principes. The third and last Squa|dron
was the biggest of the three, and had almost as many in it as both the other: and

this was made up of the ancientest and most experienced Soldiers, whom they called Triarii.
They too had their certain distances, but something greater than in either of the other. In
their Battels, the Hastati were in the Van; the Principes behind them, and the Triarii in
the Rear. To every one of these Squadrons there was a body of Horse, which being
drawn up in two divisions, and disposed one of the right, and the other on the left hand of
the Army, represented two wings, and were therefore called Ala. These three Squadrons
preceded and followed one another exactly, but the Hastati in the first Squadron were
drawn up closer, That, being to receive the first impetus of the Enemy, they might en|dure
it the better. The Principes that followed them was not in such close order, but
were disposed at more distance, to the end that if the Hastati should be forced to retire,
they might be received into that Squadron without disorder or confusion. But the Triarii
were drawn up with greater spaces and intervals than both the other, and for the same rea|son,
that if they were repulsed, that might fall back among them, and make an entire
Body together: Being drawn up in this order, the Hastati began the sight; if they were
over-powred by the Enemy and forced to give ground, they fell back to the Principes,
and uniting with them, renewed the fight in one body; if they were both of them too
weak, and unable to bear up against the Enemy, they retreated gradually into the spaces
betwixt the Triarii, and then all the three Squadrons being joyned, the whole Army
charged in a body, and if they were beaten, farewel, there was no more reserves, but the
Battel was lost; and because whenever the Triarii was engaged, the whole Army was in
nger, this Proverb grew very frequent, Res reducta est ad Triarios. Things are now at
the Extremity. The Generals of our times, having laid aside all the old discipline of the
Romans, have neglected this among the rest, to their no little prejudice. For he that
draws up his Army in a posture with two such reserves, must be beaten three times before
he can be utterly defeated; whereas once beating will do the Enemies business. But he
that trusts only to the first shock (as the Christian Armies do generally now) may easily
be broken, the least disorder, or relaxation of courage, puting all to the rout. And
that which is the reason why our Armies are so quickly defeated, is, because they have lost
the old way of falling back one body into another, and rallying three times. For whoever
draws up his Army according to Modern Custom, does it with one of these two inconve|niences,
He either draws up his several Squadrons shoulder to shoulder, and by enlarging
his Ranks, makes his Files very thin (which weakens his Army very much by leaving the
distance so small betwixt the Front, and the Rear) or else he draws them up deeper, ac|cording
to the manner of the Romans; but then their Files are so close, that if the Front
be beaten (there being no spaces in the Battel to receive them) they entangle and confound
one another; so as the Front being repulsed, falls foul upon the middle Squadron, and both
of them upon the third, whereby they are embarrassed, and hindred from advancing or
receiving the Enemy in any order, and the whole Battel is lost. The Spanish and French
Armies at the Battel of Ravenna (where Monsieur de Foix the French General was slain)
fought very well, being drawn up according to the mode of our times, with their Fronts
so extended, that their Battalions were much more in wideness than depth and his was
done in respect of the ground, which in that place was very spacious and large; for being
sensible that retreats are more difficult where the Files are too deep, they drew them up
large in the Front to prevent it as much as possible: But when they are straightned for
room they are forced to be contented, and draw up as well as they can, for there is no
remedy. They are subject likewise to the same disorders in their Marches and Incursions
into the Enemies Country, whether to forrage, or upon some other design. In the War
betwixt the Florentines and Pisans (upon their Rebellion after the King of France's
passage into Italy) coming to a Battel at Santo Regolo, the Florentines were defeated by
their own Horse, which being drawn up in the Front of the Army, and charged smartly
by the Enemy, were put into disorder, and forced to fall foul upon their Foot, which
broke the whole Army. And I have been many times assured by Monsieur Griacus
de Burgo (an old Officer of Foot in the Florentine Army) that their Foot had not fled
that day, but for the disorder of their own Horse; The Swizzers (the best Soldiers
of our times) when they are drawn up with the French, will be sure to be drawn
up in the Flanks, that if their Horse should be beaten, they may not be driven in
among them. And though these things seem easie to be understood, and more easie
to practise, yet there has not been one of our late Generals that has found the way of
imitating this old method, or correcting the new; for though they also have their Armies
divided into three Squadrons, which they call the Van-guard, the Body, and the Rear;
yet they use them only in their Marches, and Incampments; but when they come to a
Battel, it is seldom seen but they are drawn up as abovesaid, and altogether run

the risk of one shock, and no more. And because some people to excuse their igno|rance,
pretend the Execution of the Cannon, will not suffer them to make use of
the old order, I shall examine in the next Chapter whether that can be a just impediment,
or not.


CHAP. XVII.
How the Armies of our times are to judge of Artillery, and whether
the general opinion of it, be true.
WHen I consider with my self how many Field Battels were fought by the Romans
in several times, it falls into my thoughts to examine what many people have
believed, that had there been great Guns in those days, as there are now, the Romans could
never have over-run Provinces, nor made them tributary so easily, nor have done so
many great things as they did; for by reason of these fire-arms, Granadoes, and such
kind of Engines, people are sooner terrified, and cannot show their valour so freely as
heretofore; To which it is added, that Armies come with more difficulty to a Battel, and
that their Orders and Ranks are not so easily kept, so that in time the whole business of
War will be dispatched by the Cannon. Not thinking it improper to enquire into these
opinions; to examine whether Artillery have added or substracted from the strength of
our Armies, and taken away, or given more occasion to our Captains of doing brave
things; I shall begin with their first opinion, that the Romans would not have made
those vast Conquests, had there been Artillery in those days: In answer, I say, that War
is twofold, defensive, or offensive; and it is first to be considered, which of these two
Wars it does most mischief or good; and though it may be said it does great mischief in
both, yet I am of opinion, it is much more prejudicial to him that is upon the defensive,
than him that is upon the offensive part. The reason is, because he who defends himself, is
either blocked up in some Town, or straightned in his Camp: If in a Town, it is either
small (like your Citadels) or large: In the first case the besieged is lost; for the force of
those Guns is such, that no wall is so thick, but in a few days they will beat it down: So
that if he has no retreat, nor time to stop up the breaches, or throw up new works within,
the Enemy enters pell mell at the breach, and the Cannon of the Town does the Garison
very little good; for this is a Maxim, where people can fall on in a crowd, and run head|long
in their fury to a storm, great Guns do never repel them. Wherefore the fierce
assaults of the Tramontani are not so easily sustained, as the attacks of the Italians who
fall not on with that fury and impatience as the other, but march up cooly and quietly to
the Battel, and do rather skirmish, than storm. Those who enter a breach in this gravity
and state, are sure to go to pot, for the Artillery does certain execution upon them: But
those who fall on briskly, and crowd one another into the breach (if there be no new
works or retrenchments thrown up within) enter as they please without any great preju|dice
by the Cannon; for though some of them may be killed, yet they cannot be so many
as to hinder the taking of the Town. That this is true, we find by many instances in Italy,
and among the rest in the Siege of Brescia, the Town revolted to the Venetians, only the
Castle stood firm for the French. That the Town might receive no prejudice from the
Castle, the Venetians fortified the great Street that comes down from the Castle with great
Guns in the Front, Flanks, and every where, so that they thought themselves secure not
only from sallies within, but from relief without. But Monsieur de Foix made no reckon|ing
of them; for marching thither with a Body of Horse, he alighted, and charging
boldly thorow the said Street, relieved the Castle, without any considerable loss. So that
he who is shut up in a small place, his walls battered down, and has nothing left but his
Artillery to defend him, is in very great danger, and can hardly escape: If the place you
defend be a large Town, where you have room enough to retire, and throw up new
works; yet your disadvantage is great, and the Enemies great Guns shall do more mischief
upon you, than yours upon him. For first you must be forced to advance your Cannon,
and raise them to some higher place; for whilst they are level with the ground, every blind,
or small work that the Enemy throws up, is sufficient to secure him; and being forced to
plant them higher, either upon the top of some Wall, or Church, or Mount (erected on
purpose) you fall under two inconveniences; One is, that you cannot bring such large
Guns upon those places, as he can bring without, because in those little places, great Guns
are not to be managed; The other is, that if you could get them up, they cannot be so

easily secur'd, because they cannot have the convenience of works or baskets to defend
them, as the Enemy has whose Guns are planted as he pleases. So that it is almost im|possible
for him that is besieged, to keep his Cannon long upon a high place, without being
dismounted, if the Enemy without has any store of Artillery; and to keep them upon the
ground, is to have little or no use of them, as I said before: so that when all is done, the
best way to defend a Town is as they did of old, by their small shot, and the courage of
the Soldier: And yet though small shot be of some use to the besieged, it cannot counter|vail
the dammage which they receive from the Enemies great shot, for by them their walls
are battered, and beaten down into the Ditches, so that when the Enemy comes to storm
(which he may do with more ease when the Ditches are filled up with the ruines of the
walls) the besieged are under great disadvantage. Wherefore, as I said before, those Guns
are more beneficial to the besieger, than the besieged. And if you do not defend your
self either in a great Town or a little, but shall choose rather some strong and convenient
place, where you may encamp and entrench, so as not to be forced to an Engagement,
but with advantage to your self; I say that in this case you have no better way now, than
the Ancients had of old, and that many times your great Guns are more inconvenient,
than otherwise; for if the Enemy falls upon your back, with any advantage of ground,
as may easily happen; That is, if he gains by accident any eminence that commands your
Camp, or surprizes you before your intrenchments are finished, he quickly dislodges you,
and compells you to fight. This was the case with the Spaniards before the Battel of
Ravenna, who entrenched upon the River Roncus, but made their  too low,
whereupon the French having the advantage of the ground, with their great Guns played
so furiously over them into their Camp, that the Spaniards , and
forced afterwards to give them Battel. And if you shall choose such a place to trench in,
as commands the whole Country, and fortifie it so well, that the 
you, yet the Enemy will have the same ways of provoking and  you, as were
practised of old, that is, by making inroads, and plundring your Country; by 
your Roads, and intercepting your Convoys, and a thousand other  and 
dities which he will put upon you, against which your Artillery will .
So that considering what has been said, and that the Roman Wars  most 
offensive; they would have had advantage by them, and in probability 
their conquests, had there been any Artillery in their times. As to the ,
that by reason of those great Guns, men could not show their valour so much as an ancient
times; I answer, it is true, and the danger is greater when they come to place their ad|ders,
and make an assault dully and heavily, and rather one by one, than in a body; their
Officers being in the same hazard, and liable to be killed at greater distance, nor can the
strongest guards, nor choicest men about them, secure them; yet for all these great dangers,
no memorable instance can be produced of any great dammage that ever was received.
For Towns are not taken usually by storm, or assault; but by way of Leaguer as formerly;
and in those that are taken by storm, the danger is not much greater than it was then; for
even in those times, whoever undertook the defence of a Town, had his Machines and
instruments of War, which though not discharged with such force, did the same execu|tion.
And as to the reaching of Commanders at a distance, and killing them in the midst
of their Reserves, there have been fewer of them slain (since great Guns came up) in 24
years Wars in Italy, than there was in any ten years in the time of the Romans; for unless
it were Count Lodovic della Mirandola (who was killed in Ferrara, when the Venetians
invaded that State) and the Duke of Nemours who was killed at Cirignuola, there has not
been one great Officer slain; for Monsieur de Foix at Ravenna dyed by the Sword. So that
if men show themselves not so couragious as formerly; it is from the weakness and ill order
of their Armies, rather than the Artillery: And whereas it is said that these great Guns
are an impediment to their fighting, and that the decision of Battels will by degrees be
left to the Artillery; I reply, That that opinion is clearly a mistake, and has been judged
so by all those who are for the old way of Discipline. For he that would have his Soldiers
good, must exercise them well, and with frequent Alarms (true or false, 'tis no matter)
accustom them to the Enemy, bring them to handy-stroaks, and as it were to take one ano|ther
by the beards; by which means they will come to a greater dexterity in handling their
weapons, and grappling with the Enemy; and for the same reason, the Foot are rather to
be relyed upon than the Horse; for if your Foot be nimble and good, you may fall with
more security upon an Enemy perplexed and embarrassed with a train of Artillery, than you
could of old when they had their Elephants, their Chariots with Cythes, and such other
devices. And if the Romans could find out remedies daily against such daily inventions,
no question but they would have found out some or other against great Guns; and so much

the more easily, because the danger of the Guns is sooner over, than the danger of the
other: for the execution which is done by the Cannon, is done before the engagement be|gins;
The execution by the Chariots and Elephants, during the whole fight; besides the
Cannon is easily avoided by the Infantry, either by posting themselves behind some bank,
or clapping down upon their bellies; and yet of this so easie and obvious an evasion, expe|rience
tells us there is seldom any necessity; for it is a hard matter to point your great
Guns so exactly, but that either they will be mounted too high and shoot over you, or too
low, and never come at you: And when the Battel is joyn'd, 'tis as clear as the day, that
neither great nor small shot is of any advantage; for if the Artillery be placed before the
Army, 'tis odds but it is taken; if behind, the execution it does, is upon themselves; and
on either side it can gaul you but little, before you get to it, and either cloy, or secure it,
and if an example be required, we have one ready in the Swizzers, who at Navarre in the
year 1513. without Horse or Artillery, or any such thing, fell upon the French Camp, and
overcame them, though they were as strong as Trenches and Artillery could make them;
and another reason is (besides what has been urged before) because Artillery ought to be
guarded (if you would have it do service) with walls or ramparts, or some such thing as
may secure it from being taken, otherwise it will be of no use, as when in field fights, it
has nothing to defend it, but the Bodies of men. In the Flanks they are of no use, more
than the old Roman Engines in those days who were placed out of their Squadrons, that
they might be managed with more dexterity, and (when-ever overlaid by the Horse or any
thing else) they were received into their Legions: and if there be any way of making ad|vantage
of Artillery in a field fight, it is this; He that uses it otherwise, understands not
very well, and puts his confidence in that which may easily deceive him: The Turk indeed
by the help of his great Guns-obtained two or three Victories against the Sophy, and the
Soldan; but if produced more from the novelty of the noise, and the terror it brought upon
their Horse, than any great execution they did. I conclude therefore that Artillery may
be good, in an Army that is stout; but where they are used in an Army that is raw and
inexperienced, they are of little advantage, if the Enemy be either couragious or
strong.


CHAP. XVIII.
How by the authority of the Romans, and the universal Discipline of the
Ancients, the Foot are more serviceable than the Horse.
BY many Arguments and Examples, it may be proved that the Romans in their Military
exploits had greater estimation for their Infantry, than their Horse; and how all
their principal designs were executed by their Foot: This appeared in their Wars with the
Latins, when the Roman Army being over-powered, and giving ground in that great
Battel near the Lake of Regillum, the Roman General caused his Cavalry to dismount, and
fight on foot, and by so doing, they recovered their ground, and got the Victory; by
which it is manifest the Romans thought them more serviceable on foot than on horse-back,
and in that posture placed more confidence in them. The same thing they practised in
many other fights, and always with good success: nor can the raillery of Hanibal be ob|jected
against this, who when news was brought him at the Battel of Cannas, that the
Consuls had caused all their Horse to dismount, resolving to fight it out on foot, cryed out
in derision, Quam mallem vinctos mihi traderent Equites. They might as will have bound
them, and delivered them to me, Which expression though coming out of the mouth of
an excellent person, yet his single authority is not to be put in the ballance against the judg|ment
of the whole Roman Commonwealth, and the experience of so many brave Captains
as had been educated under it; and if it were, there are reasons to defend it: The Foot
can get into several places, where the Horse cannot get: The Foot keep their ranks better
than the Horse, and in any disorder, are sooner rallyed, and in a posture again, whereas
the Horse are more unmanageable, and when once out of order, with great difficulty to
be rallyed. Besides (as it is among men) so it is among Horses, some are high spirited
and couragious, others are untoward and dull; and it frequently happens, that a mettled
Horse, has a cowardly Rider, or a mettled Rider a dull Horse; be it which it will, the
disparity is inconvenient. A body of Foot well order'd and drawn up, will easily be too
hard, for the same number of Horse; but the same number of Horse, will have hard ser|vice
to break a Body of Foot, if there be any thing of proportion betwixt them; and this

opinion is confirmed not only by ancient and modern examples, but by the relations and
constitutions of Legislators, and whoever else have left any rules and directions for the
Government of an Army; for though they tell us, indeed, That at first, Horse were in
greatest reputation, because the way of ordering of Foot was not known; but as soon as
the way of managing them was found out, and their usefulness was discovered, they were
preferred to the Horse. Not but that Horse are very necessary in an Army to scout abroad,
make incursions into the Enemies Country, pursue the Enemy when he runs, and con|front
their Horse when they come to a Battel, yet the hopes and strength of an Army lies
more especially in the Foot, and if any one error in the Conduct of our Italian Princes has
contributed to the enslaving of their Country, it is their neglecting to improve themselves
in the management of Foot, and addressing themselves wholly to the Horse. And this
fault proceeded from the malignity of the Officers, or the ignorance of those who govern'd
the State: For this last 25 years, the Commands of the Italian Militia being in the hands
of Reformades and Soldiers of fortune, who had no setled Estates, they made it their de|sign
to preserve their Commands by all possible means, though with never so much preju|dice
to their Masters: And because a great Body of Foot, was not like to be long paid
(nor would there always be occasion to use them) and a little one would not turn to account;
they applyed themselves wholly to the Discipline of Horse; for 200 or 300 Horse was a
fair Command, and maintained the Officers in a good reputation; nor was the charge so
great, but their Governors could pay them. For the better insurance therefore of their
places, they began to undervalue and decry the Foot service, in such manner, that by de|grees,
they were almost wholly laid aside; so that in the greatest of their Armies, there
were very few Foot; the unhappiness of which practice, with other irregularities in our
days, has made the Italian Militia so weak, it has not been able to defend it self against
the insults, and depredations of foreigners. So then the Foot is with more confidence
to be rely'd upon, than the Horse; and that this was the judgment of the Romans, appears
by another example. The Romans were encamped before Sora, and a party of Horse sal|lying
out of the Town to beat them from some post, was met by a Roman Captain at the
Head of his Troop, who charging his adversary, it was their fortune both of them to be
slain. However, their Troops continued the fight, though their Officers were dead, and
the Romans to facilitate their Victory, dismounted in the middle of the fight, and forced
the Enemy to do the same, if they had a mind to defend themselves; so that the nature of
the fight was changed; the Foot service was preferred, and the Samnites were routed.
Nothing can be more plain, that the Foot were preferred, than this case; for though upon
other occasions the Consuls many times dismounted their Troops, yet it was to reinforce
and bring off the Foot, that were overlaid by the Enemy; but here they dismounted not
to relieve their own Foot, or to engage with the Enemies, but fighting Horse against Horse,
and finding their Victory doubtful, they thought, though they could not master them on
Horse-back, they might do it on foot, and accordingly they alighted: I conclude there|fore,
that a Body of well ordered Foot is very hardly to be broken, but by another Body of
the same. Crassus and Marcus Antonius, with a small Body of Horse, but a good Army
of Foot, over-run and harrassed the whole Country of the Parthians for several days toge|ther,
though the Parthians had a vast Army of Horse to defend it. Crassus 'tis true mis|carried
in the Expedition, but it was more by the falshood, than gallantry of the Enemy;
for relying too much upon their promises, he was reduced to such distress for Provisions,
that he and his whole Squadron were lost; nevertheless in the midst of these exigences,
being in an open and Champian Country, where there were no Mountains, no Woods, no
Rivers to shelter or ease them, far from all relief, and nothing left to sustain them, the
Foot brought themselves off under the command of M. Anthonie, and behaved themselves
so well in the opinion of the Parthians themselves, that their vast Army of Horse durst not
venture upon them: But to what purpose do we trouble our Reader with examples so
remote, we have testimony nearer home that will do it effectually. We have known in
our time 9000 Swizzers at Novara attack 10000 Horse, and as many Foot (being
most Gascoignes) they never regarded: After this 26000 Swizzers set upon the King of
France in Milan, who had with him 20000 Horse, 40000 Foot, and a hundred pieces of
Artillery, and though they did not vanquish him, as at the Battel of Novara, yet they
fought him bravely for two days together, and though worsted at last, yet the greatest
part of them got off. Marcus Regulus Attilius, placed such confidence in his Foot, that
he not only opposed them to the Enemies Horse, but to their Elephants; and though his
success did not answer his expectation, yet it hindered not, but that as great matters might
have been expected from his Foot. So then whoever would defeat a Body of Foot well
ordered, must do it with another Body better ordered than they, or it is never to be done.

In the time of Philip Visconti Duke of Milan, 16000 Swizzers having made a descent in|to
Lombardy, Carmignuola the said Dukes General marched against them with about 1000
Horse and some Foot; for not being acquainted with their way of fighting, he thought
they would have been sufficient, but having fallen upon them with his Horse, and been
repulsed with loss, being a wise man, and one that knew how to frame himself to every
accident, he recruited very well, marched against them again, and coming to an engage|ment,
caused all his Cuirassiers to dismount, and at the Head of his Foot, fall on upon the
Swizzers, who were not able to resist them. For the Cuirassiers being compleatly arm'd,
forced their way into the Body of the Swizzers without any loss, so as their whole Army
was defeated, and cut off, and none left alive, but what were preserved by the humanity
of Carmignuola. I do not doubt but many people are well enough satisfied in their judg|ments,
that Foot are more serviceable than Horse, yet such is the infelicity of our times,
that neither ancient nor modern examples, nor the confession of those who have tryed
them are sufficient to prevail with our Princes to correct this Error, or to believe that to
give reputation to the Arms of a Province, it is necessary to revive this Order, countenance
their Foot, and see them well pay'd; and then doubtless they will repay him by their
noble Exploits. But they deviate from this way, as they do from the rest, and therefore
no wonder if their Conquests be more to the detriment, than augmentation of their
State.


CHAP. XIX.
The Conquests of Commonwealths that are ill governed, and contrary to the
Model of the Romans, do conduce more to the ruine, than advancement of
their affairs.
THese false opinions of the use and excellence of Horse and Foot, are so rooted in the
minds of men, and so confirmed with ill Examples, that no body thinks of refor|ming
our late errors, or restoring the old Discipline of the Romans. Thirty years since
who could have persuaded an Italian that 10000 Foot could have assaulted 10000 Horse,
and as many Foot, and have beaten them? Yet this was done by the Swizzers at Novara.
For though all Histories ring of it, yet none of our people will believe that it is possible
to do now, what was anciently done. They object the excellence of our Horse, and say
they are so well arm'd, that they are able to repulse not only a Body of Foot, but even
a Mountain or Rock; and by these kind of fallacious Arguments, they deceive themselves,
not considering that Lucullus with a few Foot defeated 150000 of Tigranes Horse, and
yet they had a sort of Cuirassiers among them like ours. This Exploit of Lucullus we
have seen acted over again by the Germans in Italy, as if on purpose to convince us of our
error. Which if Princes and Common-Wealths could be persuaded to believe, they
would commit fewer faults, be more strong against the insults of the Enemy, and not
place all their hopes in their Heels, as they do at this day; and those who had the Govern|ment
of any Civil State, would know better how to conduct and manage themselves, ei|ther
as to the enlargement, or conservation of their Dominion, and find, that Leagues
and Confederacies, rather than absolute Conquests; sending Colonies into what they had
conquered; making publick feuds of the spoils of the Enemy; to infest and perplex the
Enemy rather with Excursions, and Battels, than Sieges; to keep the publick rich, and
the private poor, and with all possible caution to keep up the Discipline of the Army, are
the ways to make a Common-Wealth formidable and great. These are the true ways of
enlarging, an Empire; all the rest are uncertain, or pernicious; and if thereby any to
whom these ways are not pleasing, they are by any means to lay aside all thoughts of ex|tending
their Dominion; to think only of regulating their Laws at home and providing
for their defence, like the little States in Germany, which by so doing have lived in peace
and tranquillity for many years together. But how industrious and careful soever we are,
in abstaining from injury, or using violence to our Neighbour, some body or other will be
injuring us, and it will be impossible to live always in quiet; from which provocation will
arise, not only a desire in us, but a necessity of vindicating our selves, and retaliating upon
them; and when this desire is once kindled, if our Neighbors do not supply us, with oc|casion,
we can find it at home, as will inevitably fall out where Citizens are opulent and
strong. And if the Cities of Germany have continued free, and at peace a long time, it
proceeds from a peculiar disposition in that Country, which is scarce to be found any

where else. That part of Germany of which I now speak (like France and Spain) was
subject to the Empire of the Romans: But when afterwards that Empire began to decline,
and the title of the Empire was removed into that Province, Those that were the wealthiest
and most powerful of the Cities (taking advantage of the pusillanimity or distresses of their
Emperors) made themselves free, paying only a small annual Rent for the redemption of
their Liberties; which being permitted, by degrees all those Cities which held immedi|ately
of the Emperour, and had no dependance upon any body else, redeemed themselves
in that manner. Whilst these Cities were imployed in this Traffick with the Emperour,
it fell out that several Corporations that belonged to the Duke of Austria, rebelled, and
having established their Liberty, they encreased so fast in reputation and wealth, that in|stead
of returning to their subjection to the Duke, they became terrible to all people about
them. From hence it is, that in our days this Province is said to consist of the Swizzers,
the free Towns, the Princes, and the Emperor. And if in the diversity of their constitu|tions,
no Wars do arise, or at least continue any time, it is from their universal respect and
defence to the Emperour, who, though his force be not great, has such reputation among
them, that upon any controversie betwixt them, he can easily compose it, and this it is
that has kept them quiet so long, that in man's memory they have had little or no trou|bles,
but what hapned betwixt the Swizzers and the House of Austria; and though for
many years past, the title of Emperour, has been in the said House; yet has it not been a|ble
to reduce the pertinacy of the Swizzers, though it has attempted it very solemnly. Nor
did the rest of the Princes and free Towns in Germany contribute their assistance against
the Swizzers, partly because they were favourers of Liberty, and partly because being
poor themselves, they had no mind the House of Austria should be rich. Germany being
constituted in this ballance, and aequilibrium, it rather reverences than fears the Authority of
the Emperour, and is quiet and at peace, because the particular Princes, and States being
contented with their own moderate Dominions, and in awe one of another, do forbear those
injuries and encroachments which are common in other places; whereas if its constitution
was otherwise, the people would certainly think of enlarging as well as their Neighbors,
and by consequence interrupt that happy tranquillity which at present they enjoy. In o|ther
Countries where there is not that exact proportion and equality of power betwixt the
Princes and free Towns, 'tis not so easie to preserve them in peace; so that those Com|monwealths
which have an ambition of extending their Empire, must do it by confede|ration,
or by the ways of the Romans, and whoever takes any other course, rather ruines,
than advantages himself; for new Conquests are prejudicial a thousand ways, and, espe|cially
when your force does not encrease with your Territory, and you are not able to keep
what you conquer; and this happens when the expence of an Enterprise is greater than
the profit, though it succeeds. This was the case with our Florentines, and the Venetians,
who after they had conquered Lombardy and Tuscany, were much weaker than before,
when one of them was contented with the Dominion of the Gulf, and the other with a
territory of six miles about. We all think of getting what we can, but take no care
which way we shall keep it; which is the more inexcusable, because we have the Roman
example before our eyes, which we may follow if we please, whereas they had no such ad|vantage,
but wrought all out by their own industry, and wisdom. But there is another
way by which new Conquests do a great deal of mischief, and especially to a well ordered
Commonwealth; and that is when the City or Province that is conquered, is voluptuous,
or effeminate; as it hapned first to the Romans, and then to Hannibal in the Con|quest
of Capua, where the contagion of their ill manners spread it self so suddenly among
the Soldiers, that had Capua been farther off, the remedies not so near, or the Romans in
the least measure corrupted themselves, that Conquest would have been the ruine of their
State: For it was true what Livy told us in these words, Iam tunc minime salubris mili|tari
disciplinae Capua, instrumentum omnium voluptatum, delinitos militum animos aver|tit
a memoria patriae. Capua at that time was no place for Military Discipline; for be|ing
the instrument and contriver of all sorts of sensuality, it debauched the minds of the Sol|dier
from the memory of his Country. And certainly such Cities and Provinces do revenge
themselves of their Conqueror without effusion of Blood; for diffusing their ill manners
among his people, they become so weak and enervated thereby, that they are at the mer|cy
of whoever assails them: which Iuvenal has excellently well expressed, when he tells
us that by their conversation among strangers, the Roman manners were so changed,
that instead of their old temperance and parsimony, they were given up wholly to luxury
and excess.

Stevior armis
Luxuria incubuit, victum ulciscitur Orbem.
What by the Conquer'd world could never be
Reveng'd by force, is done by luxurie.
Things being thus, and even the people of Rome, notwithstanding the excellence of their
constitution and discipline, being subject to suffer, and be corrupted by their new acquisi|tions;
what will become of those who have no such virtue nor education to defend them?
but besides all the errors above-mentioned, are guilty of another as dangerous as the rest,
and that is, by making use in their Wars, not of their own Subjects or Soldiers, but of Auxi|liaries,
and Hirelings.


CHAP. XX.
No Prince, or Commonwealth without manifest danger, can employ foreign
Forces, either Auxiliary, or Mercenary.
HAd I not discoursed at large in another place about the inconvenience of Auxiliary or
Mer Forces, in respect of ones own, I would have taken this opportunity to
have spoken more of it here, than I shall do now: but having done it already, I shall only
touch upon it at present, which I cannot forbear, upon a new occasion which I have met
withal in Livr. I call those Forces Auxiliaries, which a Prince or Confederate sends to
your assistance under his own Officers, and pay. Of this sort were the two Legons which
after the defeat of the Samnites, upon the importunity of the Capu  left with them
for the security of their City. But those Legions which were intended for the defence of
that City, languishing in ease, and wallowing in luxury, began to forget the Disciplne of
their Country, and their Reverence to the Senate, and contrive how they might make
themselves Masters of the Town, conceiving the Inhabitants unworthy to enjoy those pos|sessions
which they were unable to defend. But this Conspiracy was dicovered in time,
and not only prevented, but punished by the Romans, as we shall shew more largly here|after:
At present I shall only say this, that of all Soldiers, none are employed with so
much hazard, as your Auxiliaries. For first, neither Soldiers nor Officers receiving pay
from you, but from the Prince or State by whom they are sent, they have but little regard
either to your interest or authority; but when the War is done, give themselves wholly to
pillaging and mischief, and that not only with the Enemy, but their Friends; moved some|times
by their own, and sometimes by the avarice of their Prince. The Romans when they
left those Legions at Capua, had no thoughts of breaking their league, or offering them any
injury; but the Souldiers being depraved by the licentiousness of the place, and encouraged
by the pusillanimity of the Inhabitants, took occasion to conspire, and doubtlesly had they
not been prevented, had seized upon the Town. This we could enforce with several other
examples, but the case is so plain, I shall content my self with this, and that of the Regini,
whose Inhabitants were not only rob'd and dispossessed, but murther'd by a Legion which
the Romans sent to them for their security. So then in prudence a Prince or Common|wealth
is to take any course, rather than to bring himself into a necessity of employing
Auxiliaries, especially when he is to rely wholly upon them; for no treaty or accommoda|tion
can be made with the Enemy, but shall be more for his advantage, than to entertain
such Forces. And if old passages be consulted, and considered together with the new, it
will be found that for one time in which they ever did good, there are hundreds in which
they have done harm: Nor can an ambitious State or Prince have a more commodious
occasion to possess himself of a City or Province, than when he is invited in this manner
for its assistance and defence. Wherefore, he whose indiscretion is so great as to make use
of such Armies, not only for his defence, but his conquests of other people, takes a course
that must necessarily undo him; for he aims at the acquisition of what he cannot keep
any longer than his Auxiliaries will give him leave, for they can take it from him when
they please: But such is the unhappiness of human ambition, that fixing their eyes only
upon present satisfaction, they never think of inconveniences that will follow, whereas
if they would reflect upon ancient examples, they would find that the less injurious they

were to their Neighbours, and the more generosity they shew towards them, the more
ready would they be to throw themselves into their Arms, as shall be shewn in the next
Chapter, by the example of the Capuans.


CHAP. XXI.
The first Praetor which the Romans ever sent out of their own City, was to
Capua, and that was 400 years after they began first to make War.
THe People of Rome (as we have said many times before) in the management of their
Wars, and the enlargement of their Empire differed much from the methods of our
times: For the Cities which they conquered (if they did not think fit to demolish them)
were left free, with the exercise of their own Laws, as before, and that without any other
mark of subjection, than the subscribing certain Articles of Agreement, and whilst they
kept them, they kept their old Priviledges and Dignity. And this Custom they observed
till they carried their Arms into Foreign Countries, and began to unravel the Govern|ments
where they conquered, and reduce whole Kingdoms and States into Provinces: This
will be clear'd, if we consider that the first Praetor which was ever sent abroad by the
Romans, was to Capua; not out of any ambitious design, but at the request of the said
Capuans to rectifie and compose some differences, which they could not do among them|selves.
The Antiates following the example of the Capuans, and moved by the same
necessity, desired a Praetor likewise, because at that time, as Livy tells us, Non solum arma,
sed jura Romana pollebant. Not only the Arms, but the Laws of the Romans were victorious.
And this way of lenity in their Government, contributed exceedingly to the enlargement
of their Empire; for those Cities or States which have been accustomed to their own Li|berty
and Laws, do more easily submit to a Dominion that seems remote and at a distance
(though indeed it may have something of servitude in it) than to that which is always be|fore
their Eyes, and keeps them in perpetual apprehension of slavery; and there is this ad|vantage
besides, That if in the administration of Justice, or the management of publick
affairs, any thing be acted to the displeasure of the people, it has less infamous reflection
upon the Prince who leaves them to their own Customs and Laws, than upon him who
sets up Magistrates of his own, and dispatches all things by them; and this way takes off a
great deal of hatred and calumny from the Prince, which would otherwise fall heavily up|on
him. Of the certainty of this opinion, we have a fresh instance in Italy; every body
knows that Genoua was oftentimes in the possession of the French, and that that King
(excepting of late years) used always to send thither a Governor of his own; at present,
(the necessity of his affairs requiring it) he has given them the election of their own Go|vernor,
and it is constantly a Genouese. No body questions but this way is most pleasing to
the City, and by consequence their affections must be much enlarged to the King. For it is
the Nature of Mankind (and inseparable from it) to trust those with more frankness, who
are least like to oppress them; and to fear those least, who are most merciful and humane.
This gentleness and familiarity in the Romans prevailed so far upon the Capuans, that
they made it their solemn request, that they would send them a Praetor, which if the Ro|man
austerity had but pretended to have done, they would not only have refused, but used
all means to have freed themselves from them. But what need we go to Rome and Capua
for examples, when we have them at home? Every one knows how long it is since Pistoia
threw it self voluntarily into the Arms of the Florentines: Every one knows the jealou|sies
and emulations that were betwixt them and the Florentines, Pisans, Lucchesi, and Sa|nesi:
and this diversity of humours proceeded not from any neglect in the Pistoians of
their affairs, or from any disesteem they had of their liberty, more than the others; but
from an ancient experience they had had of the affection and tenderness of the Florentines,
and that was the true cause why they threw themselves under their protection; whereas
carrying themselves more severely to the rest, they were so far from coming in, and sub|mitting
to their jurisdiction, that they did what they could, and tryed all ways possible to
disclaim it. And doubtless had the Florentines, by their Leagues, or supplies comported
themselves with more kindness to their Neighbors, and not incensed them by their austeri|ties,
they had been Masters of all Tuscany at this hour; Not but that Arms and Severity
are to be used upon occasion, but mild ways are to be tryed first, and extremities only in
extremity.



CHAP. XXII.
How uncertain the judgments of most People are, in things of
greatest importance.
HOw false and erroneous the opinions of men are, all persons can testifie who have
any conversation in their Counsels; which unless managed by persons of more
than ordinary sagacity, are for the most part contrary to the truth. And because men of
these excellent qualifications, in corrupted States (especially in times of peace) by reason
of the envy or ambition of other people, are subject to be hated; such Counsels are fre|quently
followed, as the deluded Commons think best, or such as are recommended by
those who are more solicitous of the favour, than the benefit of the people: But their
errors being discovered in the time of their adversity, necessity directs them to those per|sons
whom in the time of prosperity they dispised, as shall be shown at large in conve|nient
place. Moreover humane consultations are subject to certain accidents by which
men are frequently deluded, unless their experience be more than ordinary, which acci|dents
are apt by their likelyhood and probability to persuade people to whatever they de|sire.
This I mention, in consideration of the advice of Numisius the Proetor (after the
Latins were defeated by the Romans) and of what was not long since generally believed
when Francis I. of France invaded Milan, which was defended by the Swizzers. For
Lewis XII. being dead, and Francis d' Angolesme succeeding in that kingdom, he had a
great design of recovering Milan, which not many years before had been taken from them
by the Swizzers, at the encouragement of Iulius II. To facilitate his Enterprize, he made
it his business to gain a party in Italy, and having made sure of the Venetians, he addressed
himself to the Florentines, and Pope Leo X. conceiving it would be a great corroboration
to his affairs if he could make them, seeing the Forces of the King of Spain were in Lom|bardy,
and the Emperours at Verona. Pope Leo could not be brought to consent, being
persuaded (as is said) by his Counsel, that if he kept himself Neuter, he should be cer|tain
of Victory; for it was not for the interest of the Church, that either the King of
France, or the Swizzers should be too potent in Italy; but he who would restore it to its
ancient Liberty, must deliver it from the servitude both of the one and the other: And
because both of them together were not to be dealt withal, nor indeed either of them a|part,
as things stood then; occasion was to be expected, and they were to attend till the
King of France and Swizzers had fought, and one of them beaten the other, and then
before the Conquerour had recruited, or recovered what he had lost in the Battel, the Pope
and his Friends should fall upon him, and so both of them be expulsed. It was impossi|ble
he should ever have a fairer opportunity; for the Enemy were both of them in the
Field, and the Popes Army strong upon the borders of Lombardy (under pretence of secu|ring
the Territories of the Church) where it might attend the event of the Battel, which
the vigor, and strength of both Armies portended would be bloody, and when they had
destroyed one another, and were both of them weaken'd, then might his Army fall securely
upon them, possess it self of Lombardy, and govern all Italy as he pleased himself. These
were the Counsels which were given his Holiness, and at first they seemed solid enough,
but how vain they prov'd afterwards, the event did clearly demonstrate; for the Swizzers
after a long and bloody Fight being defeated the Popes and the King of Spains Forces were
so far from taking that opportunity of falling upon the French (as they had promised them|selves)
That they prepared to run away, nor would that have secured them, had not they
been befriended by the humanity (not to say laziness) of the King of France, who con|tenting
himself with one Victory, never regarded a second, but strook up a Peace with the
Pope: And truly at a distance these Counsels seem'd not unreasonable, though in reality
they were irrational and idle; for the Conqueror seldom loses many men, what he loses is
in the Fight, and the greatest part of the execution is in the pursuit; but grant a Battel is a
long time before it be decided (which notwithstanding happens but seldom) and that many
are slain and disabled of the conquering side, yet the reputation of Victory gives the Con|queror
such esteem, and strikes such awe and terror into all people, as transcends the consi|deration
of any loss he can sustain: so that he is in an egregious error, who thinks a victo|rious
Army may be the more easily overcome by reason of the prejudice it received in the
Fight; for 'tis madness to attempt such an Army with a less number, than you would have
engaged it before; because their late fortune will add to their courage. This appeared by

the experience of the Latins; by the Counsel of Numisius the Praetor; and by the losses
of the people who followed it. For the Romans having beaten the Latins with much ado,
and such slaughter of their own men, that they seemed to have got nothing of a Victory
but the Name; Numisius proclaimed it up and down, that then was the time to recover
their liberty, and that if with new Forces they fell suddenly upon the Romans, before they
were recruited, or had any expectation of being invaded, they would certainly be over|thrown:
Upon which the Latins believing him, raised a new Army, and fell upon the
Romans, but they were presently defeated, and suffered the inconvenience, to which all
people are subject that follow such Counsels.


CHAP. XXIII.
How the Romans upon any accident which necessitated them to give judgment
upon their Subjects, avoided always the mid way.
JAm Latio is status erat rerum, ut ne bellum ne pacem pati possent. The Latins were
now in such a condition, that they were neither fit for War nor Peace. And what Livy
said of Latium, is true every where else; That Prince or Commonwealth is at the highest
pitch of unhappiness, which is in such a condition, as that he can neither receive Peace,
nor maintain War: And this happens, when people are conquered, and necessitated to
submit upon such hard terms as in their hearts they disdain, or else (to go on with the
War) are constrained to implore their assistance, who will make them a prey. The ways
by which we are brought into so sad a condition, are commonly ill Counsels, for want of
just consideration of our affairs, both as to Mony and Men. For that Commonwealth or
Prince who takes right measures in those, shall very hardly fall into the dresses of the
Latins, who accepted the condition of the Romans when they should have refused them;
and declared War against the Romans when they should have desired a Peace; so that as
they ordered the matter, the enmity and amity of the Romans did equally afflict them.
The first that overcame them was Manlius Torquatus, and after him Camillus, who seized
upon all their Cities, and putting Garisons in them, return'd to Rome, and in his account
to the Senate acquainted them, that the whole Country of the Latins was then in their
hands. And because the Sentence and Judgment of the Senate at that time upon the
Latins is more than ordinarily remarkable; That it may be readier for the imitation of
Princes when occasion is offered, I shall set down the rds which Livy makes Camillus
speak, which confirm what we have said about the ways which the Romans observed in the
enlargement of their Empire; and shows, that in their determinations in matters of State,
they left the middle ways, and followed only the extreams. For Government is nothing
but keeping Subjects in such a posture as that they may have no will, or power to offend
you. And this is done either by taking away all means from them of doing you any hurt;
or by obliging and indulging them so, as they may not in reason hope to better their for|tune;
all which will appear, first by Camillus his Speech to the Senate, and then by their
resolution upon it. His words were these, Dii immortales ita vos potentes hujus Consilii
fecerunt, ut sit Latium, an non sit, in vestra manu posuerint. Ita pacem vobis, quod ad
Latinos attinet, parare in perpetuum, vel soeviendo, velignoscendo potestis. Vult is crudeliter
consulere in debitos victos? licet delere omne Latium. Vultis exemplo Majorum augere rem
Romanam, victos in Civitatem accipiendo? Materia crescendi per summam gloriam suppet it.
Certe id firmissimum imperium est, quo obedientes gaudent. Illorum igitur animos dum Ex|pectatione
stupent, seu poen, seu beneficio praeoccupari opportet. The Gods have put it into the
power of this Reverend Council, to determine whether the Latins shall be a people, or not. As
to them, your peace will be perpetual, which way soever you take; Are you disposed to severity,
and will destroy those poor people that are conquered, and your Prisoners? They are at your
mercy, and you may extinguish their very name. Are you disposed according to the example
of your Ancestors to propagate your interest by receiving them into your City? You have an
opportunity of doing it with the highest advantage and glory. Certainly no Empire is so
firm, as where Subjects exsult in their obedience. It will be expedient therefore, whilst they are
in amazement and suspence, to settle their minds one way, either by punishment or pardon.
According to the Consuls proposal, the Senate came to an issue, and gave sentence Town
by Town, according to the Nature of their deserts; but all in extreams, without any me|diocrity;
for some they not only pardoned, but loaded them with benefits, made them fe
of their own City, and gave them many other priviledges, and exemptions, and the y

secured them not only from Rebelling, but from ever conspiring again. The rest whom
they thought fit to make examples, were brought Prisoners to Rome, punish'd with all
kind of severity, Their Houses destroyed, their Lands confiscated, their Persons dispersed, so
as it was not possible for them any way to do any mischief for the future. This was the way
the Romans took in the settlement of Latium, which ought to be observed and imitated by
all wise Princes and States; and if the Florentines had followed it in the year 1502. when
Arezzo and the whole Valley of Chiana rebelled, they had continued their Authority, aug|mented
their State, and supplyed themselves with those Fields which they wanted for their
subsistance. But they took the middle way (betwixt the extreams of rigour and remis|sion)
which is always most dangerous; they kept the City, removed the Magistrates, de|graded
the great Men, banished some, and executed others. If any in their Councils ad|vised
to have the City demolished, it was answered, It could not be done without dishonor
and rexection upon their own; as if Florence was so weak and inconsiderable, it was not
able to keep a Garrison in Arezzo. This Argument was of that sort which carry some
appearance, but are not really true. 'Tis much as if we should argue a Parricide or Felon,
or other egregious Malefactor, is not to be put to death, lest it should be thought the Prince
or Republick was too impotent to restrain them any other way. But those who are of that
opinion are to consider, that when a private person, or whole City offends so highly against
his Prince, or his Government; To make them examples to other people, and bridle them
so as they may be sure to be no more guilty for the future, the surest way is utterly to destroy
them; and it is more honourable for a Prince to extirpate them quite at once, than to
endeavour to preserve them with a thousand difficulties and dangers: For whoever he be
that knows not how to punish his delinquents according to the merits of their offences, and
so as to secure himself for the future, is either a weak, or a poor spirited Prince. To con|firm
what is said, we may produce another example of the Romans, in their Sentence upon
the Privernates; from whence (as Livy says) two things are to be concluded; one is, that
Rebels are to be pardoned frankly, and obliged; or utterly extinguished. The other that
generosity of mind, and steddiness and constancy in our answers when given to wise men,
make strangely for our advantage. The Roman Senate was assembled to give Sentence up|on
the Privernates who had been in Rebellion, and being reduced by force of Arms, had sent
several of their chief Citizens to implore the mercy of the Romans: being brought into
the Senate (where every body was persuading according to his inclination, some for mercy,
and some for severity) one of the Senators (before they could come to a resolution) ask'd
one of the Petitioners, Quam poenam meritos Privernates censeret. What punishment he
thought his fellow Citizens deserved: To which he replyed, Eam quam merentur qui se
libertate dignos censent, The same that they deserve, who desire to be free. The Senator
continuing, Quid si poenam remittimus vobis, qualem nos pacem vobiscum speremus? If we
should pardon you this time, what peace could we hope for from you? To which he answer|ed,
Si bonam dederitis,  fide lem  perpetuam; si malam, haud diuturnam. If it be upon good
terms, it will be firm and perpetual; if upon ill, it will hardly last long. Upon which the
better part of the Senate (though some opposed it) declared, Se audivisse vocem liberi 
viri; nec credi posse illum populum aut hominem deni in ea conditione cujus eum paeniteat,
diutius quam necesse sit mansurum. Ibi pacem esse fidam, ubi voluntarii pacati sint, ne eo
loco ubi servitutem esse velint, fidem sperandam. That he had spoke like a man, and like a
Free-man. That it was not to be imagined any people or private person would submit to a
condition that oppress'd him, longer than by necessity he was constrained. That if any peace
be lasting and inviolable, it is where the parties do voluntarily subscribe, not where servitude
and slavery is imposed. And thereupon it was decreed, that the Privernates should be
Civitate donati, and enjoy all the Priviledges of the Romans, concluding, Eos qui nihil
praeterquam de libertate cogitant dignos esse qui Romani fiant. That they deserved to be Ro|mans,
whose liberty was the greatest part of their care. And this frank and generous way of
answering, took mightily with those grave men, as knowing that whatever they had said
otherwise, would not have been from the heart, but with compliance and submission to
their fortune and distress. And this is most certain, whoever speaks otherwise (especially
if either he has been or but thought himself free) does but equivocate, and he that be|lieves
him, takes wrong Counsels, such as are neither good for himself, nor satisfactory
to them, which many times produces Rebellion, and the ruine of the State, And things
being so, we conclude, according to our proposition in the beginning of our discourse;
That upon any great Sentence to be given against a people or City that has been formerly
free, the surest way is, to wave all moderation, and either to caress or extinguish them.
He that proceeds otherwise, will find himself in an error, as the Samnites were, when ha|ving
enclosed the Romans ad Turcas Caudinas, they neither discharged them freely, nor

put them to the Sword, as one of their grave Citizens advised; but abused them, and pil|laged
them, and dismissed them sub jugum when they had done. But not long after, they
were made sensible of their error, and that the old Citizen was in the right; as we shall
show more at large hereafter.


CHAP. XXIV.
That in the generality, Castles and Citadels, do more mischief than good.
TO the States-men of our times, it may perhaps seem indiscretion or inadvertancy in
the Romans, that being desirous to keep Latium, and Privernum in subjection, they
built neither Castles nor Citadels to secure them: and indeed they differed exceedingly
from our Florentine Politicians, who are of opinion that not only Pisa, but all other Cities
whatever are to be kept under that way, and surely had the Romans been like us, they
would have been of the same opinion; but differing in their courage, their judgment, and
their power, they differed likewise in their resolutions. Nor during all the time of their
liberty, were the Romns known to build any Castle or Citadel to keep any City in awe, or
any Province in peace; only some indeed which were fortified before, they garrisoned, and
continued; which being so, and quite contrary to the Sentiment of our times, I think it
not amiss, if in this place I inquire whether such things be profitable or unprofitable to the
persons who build them. It is therefore to be considered, that such Fortresses are erected,
either to repel an Enemy, or restrain a Subject, and keep him in obedience. In the first
case I do pronounce them unnecessary; in the second dangerous. They are dangerous,
and do rather obstruct than promote obedience in the Subject; because the great danger of
Rebellion proceeds from hatred which the people have conceived against their Prince, that
hatred proceeds from his injustice to the people, and he is said to be unjust when he governs
them arbitrarily, and by force, which is never so manifest, as when he builds such Ca|stles
and Citadels among them, that no man might be able in any manner to oppose him.
Which being so, those kind of Fortifications are not only useless and improper to keep the
Subject in subjection; but dangerous, seeing by presumption upon them, Princes are en|couraged
to treat their Subjects worse than otherwise they would do, by which they con|tract
the odium of the people; and what is the consequence? Rebellion and Blood, and
Confusion: Neither when troubles arise, and Wars break out, is there that defence or
security in them, as is now adays imagined; for there are only two ways of keeping a
conquered people in obedience, you must either have a standing Army (as the Romans
had) always ready to subdue them; or you must divide, disperse, or destroy them in such
manner, that they may never get together again to disturb you: For though you impo|verish
and plunder them never so much, Spoliatis arma supersunt, They will find Arms to
revenge themselves; and if you disarm them never so carefully, Furor arma, ministrat.
Their fury will supply them. If you cut off their Commanders, like Hydra's, others will
succeed, and do as much mischief: If you build these Castles, in time of Peace they may
be serviceable, and make you more bold, and secure against your Subjects; but when
War comes, and both your Subjects and Enemies infest you, it is impossible they should
defend you against both. And if ever they were useless, it is now since the use of Artille|ry
is known, against the fury of which no little Fort (from whence other Guns cannot
play with security again, and where they want ground for repairing their breaches, or ma|king
new retrenchments upon occasion) can possibly stand: and being so, consider serious|ly
with your self whether these kind of Fortresses are like to keep your old Subjects, or your
new Conquests in obedience? If your Territory be hereditary, and you have received it
from your Ancestors, to build Castles to keep your own natural Subjects in obedience, will
be to little purpose, for the reasons abovesaid, seeing they will be but a means to make you
and your posterity the more Tyrannical, and by consequence expose you to the hatred of
the people, against which they will be afterwards unable to defend you. So that for these
reasons, that neither he himself nor his heirs may have occasion to entrench too much upon
the people; and the people have no occasion to abhor him, a wise Prince will never build
Citadels; and though Francesco Sforza Duke of Milan was reputed a wise Man, and
built a Citadel at Milan to secure his Usurpations, yet his wisdom did not appear in that,
for it proved afterwards the ruine of his posterity. For presuming upon that, they took
the more confidence to oppress the people, which incensed them so highly, that they re|volted
upon the first approach of an Enemy, and turned their Prince out of that Province.

So that that Citadel did him no good in time of War against the incursions of the Enemy;
and in time of Peace, making him more insolent, it did but expose him to the hatred of
the people; whereas if no Citadel had been built, and yet they had been so indiscreet as to
have behaved themselves insolently to their Subjects, some or other of them who had
been injured would have remonstrated to their Prince, the danger of his courses, before he
had contracted the general odium; by which there would have been a possibility that he
might have reform'd, and reconciled himself to his Subjects; and had he done so, he
would have better defended himself against the French with the affections of his people,
and no Citadel; than with a Citadel, and no affections of the people. Besides there are
many ways of losing these Citadels; by force, by fraud, by corrupting the Governour, by
starving, and by storm. And if you have lost a City, which you are in hopes of recovering
by the favour of the Citadel, which still holds out for you; it will require an Army
as much as if there were no Citadel at all; and so much the stronger, by how much 'tis
probable the people may be more incensed from the mischief which they have received out
of the Castle, than they would have been, had there been no Castle at all. Experience
it self has since taught us that that Citadel of Milan was of no advantage, either to the
Dukes of Milan, nor French in time of their adversity; but in time of Peace did them
much prejudice, by hindring them from taking such ways as might have obliged the peo|ple,
and rendered them well affected to their Government. Guido Ubaldo Son to Fredric
Duke of Urbin, was a great Captain as any in his time, being driven out of his Country
by Coesar Borgia (Son to Alexander VI.) and recovering it afterwards by an accident, he
caused all the Fortresses in the whole Province to be dismantled, and destroyed; as things
which he had found by experience were more to his prejudice than security. For being
beloved by the people, he would not do them the injury to put Garisons in them; and
if he had, upon any invasion from the Enemy, he could not have kept them without a
field Army to relieve them. Iulius the Pope, having driven the Bentivogli out of Bononia,
built a Citadel there, and put in such a Governour as partly by his own ill nature, and
partly by the instructions o his Master, killed many of the Citizens, and committed seve|ral
cruelties, which provoked the Bononians so exceedingly, that they rebelled, and reco|vered
the Citadel, which had the Governour been more moderate, might have been longer
in his power. Nicolo de Castello Father of the Vitelli, (returning into his Country, from
whence he had been banished by the Popes) immediately demolished two Fortresses which
had been raised by Sixtus IV. as judging the hearts of the people more like than those Castles,
to secure him. But of all, there is no example, evinces the unusefulness of these kind
of Garisons, and the convenience of taking them away, more than that which hapned
lately at Genoa; for the said City revolting from Lewis XII. of France, in the year 1507.
Lewis came with a strong Army into Italy, and having reduced it, built a Castle of greater
strength and capacity than any of that time; for it was built upon a promontory that Com|manded
the Sea called Godefa, the Harbour, and the Town, so that by all people it was
held inexpugnable. But the French being driven out of Italy in the year 1512. Genoa
rebelled (notwithstanding the Castle) and Ottanio Fegosa taking the Government upon
him, in sixteen months brought the Castle to such extremity, that it was forced to surren|der;
whereupon, though he was advised to keep it as a refuge in case of any disaster; yet
being a wise man, and knowing well that a Prince is in nothing so safe, as in the affections
of his Subjects, he caused it to be demolished, and he found the benefit of that Counsel,
for by it he has held that Government to this day; and that so strongly, that whereas be|fore,
the appearance of a thousand Foot was sufficient at any time to have carried it; his
adversaries assaulted it with ten thousand, and could do him no wrong. So that we see
the demolishing de Fegosa no hurt, and the making it did the King of France no good;
for when he was able to bring an Army into Italy, he was able to recover Genoa without
the help of the Castle; but when he could bring no Army, he could not keep it, though
the Castle was for him: From whence it follows, that as the building of it, was a great
expence, and the loss of it a great dishonour to the King of France; so the taking of it
was great glory to Ottaviano, and the ruining it, a great advantage. And it is the same
thing with those who build them in their new Conquests, to keep their new subjects in
obedience, which if the example of Genoa and the French should be insufficient to prove,
the Cities of Florence and Pisa, will do it effectually. The Florentines built a Citadel at
Pisa, and several other Fortresses to keep it in aw; not considering that a City which had
been free, and in continual emulation of the Florentine greatness, was not any other way
to be kept to its duty, unless (according to the practice of the Romans) they made a fair
and honourable league with it, or utterly subverted it. But how much those Fortresses
answered their designs, appeared when Charles VIII. made his Expedition into Italy, to

whom they were generally surrendered, either thorow the fear or falshood of their Go|vernors.
So that had not they been built, the Florentines had never relyed so much upon
them for the keeping of Pisa, but had thought of some safer way to have secured it against
the King of France. I conclude then, that to keep ones own Native Country in subje|ction,
Fortresses are dangerous, and to keep new Conquests, they are ineffectual: To
prove that the authority and practice of the Romans ought to be sufficient, who whenever
they had a mind to restrain the power, and bridle the fury of the people, did it not by
erecting new Fortresses, but by demolishing the old. If it be objected that Tarentum of
old, and Brescia of late years were recovered by the fidelity of the Castles, when the Towns
had revolted. I answer, that as to the recovery of Tarentum, the Castle contributed no|thing,
for the Consul Quintus Fabius was sent thither with an Army strong enough to
have retaken it, had there been no Castle at all: and, what advantage was it to the Romans
that the Castle held for them, if the recovery of the Town required a Consular Army, and
the presence of so great a Soldier as Fabius Maximus; and that they might have retaken it
without the help of the Castle, is clear in the example of Capua, which they recovered,
when there was no Castle to befriend them. In the case of Brescia, the circumstances were
very extraordinary; for it seldom happens that when a City revolts, and the Castle holds
out for you, That the Castle has a field Army hard by, and ready to relieve you. Monsieur
de Foix General for the King of France, being with his Army at Bologna, and understanding
the desection of the Brescians, marched immediately to recover it, and in three days time
(by the help of the Castle) was Master of it again. So that it was not wholly by the
benefit of the Castle that Brescia was recovered, but by the presence and dextery of Mon|sieur
de Foix and his Army. And this example may be sufficient to ballance all others to
the contrary; for we see daily in our times, multitudes of Castles taken and retaken, and
following the fate of their Cities, and that with no more difficulty or variety of fortune,
than when there are none at all; as has been visible in Lombardy, Romagna, the Kingdom
of Naples, and all other quarters of Italy. And as to those Citadels which are built in
your new Conquests, to defend you from your Enemies abroad; they also are absolutely
unnecessary, where you have an Army in the field; and where you have none, they are of
no use. A good Army without any such Forts, is sufficient to defend you. And this has
been found by experience by all those who have been thought excellent in the Arts of War,
or of Peace; and particularly by the Romans and Spartans: The Romans never erected
any new Castles, and the Spartans never suffered any old; but what Cities soever they
conquered, down went their Walls; nay, even in their own Cities they would not permit
any fortification, as believing nothing so proper to defend them as the virtue and courage
of their Citizens. A Spartan being demanded by an Athenian, Whether the Walls of Athens
were not very beautiful? Yes, says the Spartan, if it was but inhabited by Women. A Prince
therefore who has a good Army in the field, may have some benefit by his Castles, if they
be upon the Frontiers of his Country, or in some places upon the Coast, where they may
etard and entertain an Enemy for some time till the Army can come up: But if the Prince
has no Army on foot, let his Castles be where they will, upon the Frontiers or elsewhere,
they are either unserviceable or dangerous: dangerous, because they are easily lost, and made
use of by the Enemy against you; or if they be too strong to be taken, yet the Enemy
marches on, and leaves them unserviceable behind him. For an Army that has no Enemy
in the field to confront it, takes no notice of Cities or Castles, but passing by as it pleases,
rambles up and down, and ravages the whole Country; as may be observed both in ancient
History and new. Francesco Maria not many years since invaded the Dutchy of Urbin, nor
concern'd himself at all, though he left ten of his Enemies Cities behind him. Wherefore
that Prince who has a good Army, need not stand upon Castles; and he that has no Castles,
need not trouble himself to build any; all that he is to do, is, to fortifie the Town of his
own residence as well as he can, and accustom the Citizens to Arms, that he may be able
to sustain an Enemy, at least for a while, till he can make his conditions, or procure relief;
All other designs are expensive in times of Peace; and unprofitable in time of War; so
that he who considers what has been said, must acknowledge that as the Romans were wise
in every thing else, so more particularly in their affairs with the Latins, and Privernates, in
not thinking of Castles and Fortresses, but of more noble and generous ways of securing
their allegiance.



CHAP. XXV.
To attempt a City full of intestine divisions, and to expect to carry it
thereby, is uncertain and dangerous.
THe divisions in the Commonwealth of Rome were so great betwixt the People and
the Nobility, that the Veientes and Hetrusci, taking the opportunity, conspired its
destruction, and having raised an Army, and harrassed their whole Country, the
Senate sent out G. Manlius, and M. Fabius against them; whose Army encamping near the
Enemy, were so provoked by the insolence of their language, that the Romans laid aside
their private animosities, and coming to a Battel overthrew them; by which we may ob|serve
how easily we erre in our Counsels, and how we lose things many times the same way
by which we intended to gain them. The Veientes thought by assaulting the Romans
whilst they were embroil'd in their intestine divisions, they should certainly overcome them;
and their invading them at that time, united the Enemy, and ruined themselves; and not
without reason, for the occasion of discord and faction in a Commonwealth is idleness,
and peace; and there is nothing unites like apprehension, and War. So that had the
Veientes been wise as they should have been, they should have forborn making War upon
them at that time, and have tryed other artificial ways to have destroyed them. The surest
way is to insinuate, and make your self a Mediator betwixt them, and to take upon your
self the arbitration, rather than they should come to blows. When it is come to that,
you are privately and gently to supply the weaker side; to foment and continue the War,
till they consume one another; but be sure your supplies be not too great, lest both parties
begin to suspect you, and believe your design is to ruine them both, and make your self
Prince. If this way be well managed, it will certainly bring you to the end which you
desired; for when both sides are weary, they will commit themselves to your arbitration.
By these Arts, the City of Pistoia returned to its dependance upon Florence; for labouring
under intestine divisions, the Florentines favouring first one side, and then the other (but
so slily that no occasion of jealousie was given to either) brought them both in a short time
to be weary of their distractions, and throw themselves unanimously into their arms.
The Government of the City of Siena had never been changed by their own domestick
dissentions, had not the Florentines supplied both parties under-hand, and fomented them
that way, whereas had they appeared openly and above board, it would have been a means
to have united them. I shall add one example more, Philip Visconti Duke of Milan made
War many times upon the Florentines, hoping by the dissentions of the City to have con|quered
them the more easily, but he never succeeded. So that complaining one time of
his misfortunes, he had this Expression, The follies of the Florentines have cost me two
millions of Mony, to no purpose. In short, as the Veientes and Tuscans found themselves in
an error (when they thought by help of the differences in Rome, to have mastered the
Romans) and were ruined themselves for their pains. So it will fare with whoever takes
that way to oppress or subvert any other Government.


CHAP. XXVI.
He who contemns or reproaches another person, incurs his hatred,
without any advantage to himself.
I Look upon it as one of the greatest points of discretion in a man, to forbear injury and
threatning, especially in words: neither of them weakens the Enemy, but threatning
makes him more cautious, and injury the more inveterate, and industrious to revenge it.
This is manifest by the example of the Veienti (of which I discoursed in the foregoing
Chapter) for not contenting themselves with the mischiefs that they brought upon them
by the War, they added contumely and opprobrious language, which so provoked and
enflamed the Roman Army, that whereas before they were irresolute, and seemed to decline
it, they now fell upon them unanimously, and over-threw them. So that it ought to be
the principal care in an Officer that neither himself nor his Soldiers do incense and exaspe|rate
his Enemy by ill language; for that makes him but the more so, does not at all hinder
him from revenging himself, but does the Author more mischief than the Enemy. And

of this we have a notable example in Asia. Gabades the Persian General having besieged
Amida a long time, without any considerable progress; weary of the tediousness of the
Leaguer, and hopeless of success, he resolved to draw off and be gone; but as he was
raising his Camp, the Garison perceiving it, got all upon the Walls, and with the basest
and most provoking circumstances imaginable upbraided them with Cowardize; which
nettled Gabedes in such manner, that he changed his Counsels, sate down again, and ply'd
it with that industry and indignation, that he took it in few days, and gave it up to the
fury of the Soldier. The same thing hapned to the Veienti (as I said before) who not
cotenting themselves to make War upon the Romans, went up under their very Noses to
reproach them; and what followed? they irritated them so, that they settled the courage,
and united the animosities of the Roman Army, and put them into so high a sit of impa|tience,
that they forced the Consul to a Battel, in which the Veientes received the reward
of their contumacy. He therefore who is General of an Army, or Governour of a Com|monwealth,
and commands or governs discreetly, hkes particular care that such ill lan|guage
be not used either in the City or Army, to one another, nor to the Enemy: For to
an Enemy, they make him but worse, unless such remedies be applyed, as are practised by
wise men. The Romans having left two of their Legions at Capoua, they conspired
against the Capouans (as shall be described more largely hereafter) which occasioned a great
sedition, but it was afterwards appeased by Valerius Corvinus, and among other things
necessary in that juncture, an Act of Oblivion was passed, with great penalty to any man
that should upbraid any of the Soldiers by their Sedition. Tiberius Grachus having the
command of a certain number of Servants (in the time of Hanibal's Wars) which the
scarcity of men, had forced the Romans to Arm, made it no less than death for any man to
reproach them by their servitude. So mindful were the Roman Officers always of pre|venting
such exprobration, as knowing that nothing provokes and incenses a man so high|ly
as to have his imperfections rip'd up, whether in earnest, or in jest, 'tis the same thing.
Nam facetiae asperae, quando nimium ex vero traxere, acrem sui memoriam relinquunt;
for biting, raillery, especially with a tincture of truth, leaves an ill impression upon the
Memory.


CHAP. XXVII.
Wise Princes, and well governed States ought to be contented with victory; for
many times whilst they think to push things forward, they lose all.
THat we use our Enemy with rude and dishonorable language, proceeds either from in|solence
upon some victory past or extraordinary confidence of obtaining it, which
being false, perplexes our understanding, and makes us err not only in our words, but our
actions. For from the time that error seizes upon our judgments, it makes us many times
lose the occasion of a certain good, in hopes of a better that is but uncertain, which is a
point not unworthy our consideration, seeing thereby our reason is disturbed, and our
State many times brought in danger of ruine; and this I shall demonstrate by examples
both ancient and modern, because arguments cannot do it so distinctly. Hanibal after he
had defeated the Romans at Cannas, sent Messengers to Carthage with the news of his Vi|ctory,
and to desire Supplies. The Senate was a long time in Counsel what was to be
done, Annon, a grave and solid Citizen being present, advised them to make wise use of
their Victory, and think of making Peace with the Romans, which they might do upon
better conditions, now they were Conquerors, than they were in reason to expect upon any
disaster. That the Carthaginians had satisfied the whole world that they were able to ba|lance
the Romans; for they had fought with them, and beaten them; and having gone so
far with honour and success, they ought not (at least in his judgment) expose what they
had got, and by hoping for more, run a hazard of losing all: But this Counsel was not
followed, though afterwards, when too late, it was found to be the better.
Alexander the great had conquered all the East, when the Commonwealth of Tyre
(a great Town situate like Venice in the water) amazed at the grandeur of Alexander, sent
Embassadors to him to offer him their obedience and subjection upon what terms he
pleased, only they were unwilling either himself, or any of his Army should come into their
Town. Alexander disdaining to be excluded by a private City, to whom the whole world
had opened their Gates; rejected their offers, sent their Embassadors back, and went im|mediately
to besiege it. The Town stood in the Sea, and was well provided both with

Victual and Ammunition; insomuch as at four months end Alexander began to consider
that that single Town had deprived his glory of more time, than many other of his Con|quests
of much greater importance: Whereupon he resolved to come to an agreement with
them, and to grant them the conditions which they demanded at first; but the Tyrians
transported with pride, not only refused his proffers, but put his Messengers to death; upon
which in a rage Alexander caused it to be assaulted immediately, and it was done with that
fury, that the Town was taken and sack'd, and part of the people put to the Sword, and
the rest made slaves. In the year 1512. a Spanish Army came into the Dominions of the
Florentines to restore the Medici in Florence, and tax the City; and they were called in,
and conducted by the Citizens themselves, who had promised, that as soon as they appeared
in those parts, they would take Arms, and declare for them; being entered in the plain,
and finding no body to joyn with them, or supply them, scarcity of provisions prevailed
with the Spaniard to think of a Treaty, and propose it to the Enemy, but the Florentines
were too high, and reused it, which was the loss of Prato, and the ruine of their State.
So then a Prince that is attack'd by another Prince more potent than himself, cannot be
guilty of a greater error, than to refuse an agreement, especially when it is offered; for
it can never be so bad, but it shall have in it something of advantage for him who accepts it,
and perhaps contribute to his Victory. It ought therefore to have satisfied the people of
Tyre, that Alexander accepted of the conditions which he had formerly denyed them; and
it had been Victory enough for them, that with Arms in their hands they had forced so
great a Conqueror to condescend. It was the same case with the Florentines; they ought
to have been contented, and thought it honour enough that the Spanish Army complyed,
and was reduced to a condition of granting part of their desires, though they would not
gratifie them in all; for it was plain, the design of that Army was to change the Govern|ment;
to break their league with the French; and to raise what Money upon them they
could. Though of these three points, they had obtained the two last, and the first alone
had remained entire to the Florentines (that is to say, the Government of the City) every
Citizen (besides the security of his life) would have had some honour and satisfaction,
without concerning themselves so much for the loss of the other two. And though by the
posture of their affairs their success seem'd to be certain; yet they ought not to have ex|posed
things to the discretion of Fortune, seeing their all was at stake, which no wise man
will hazard but upon inevitable necessity. Hanibal having left Italy, where he had been
sixteen years together with a great deal of honour, being called home to the relief of his
own Country, found Asdrubal and Siphax defeated; the Kingdom of Numidia lost; The
Carthaginians retired, and coop'd up within the circumference of their own walls, so as
they had no hopes but in Hanibal and his Army. Hanibal being sensible that this was the
last cast, and that if he miscarried, his Country was quite lost, resolved to put nothing
to a hazard, till he had tryed all other ways; and was not ashamed to make the first
overture of a Peace, as knowing that if there was any hopes left for his Country,
it was in that, rather than War; but being refused, he resolved to fight (though with
very little hopes) supposing he might possibly win the day, or if he did lose it, it should
not be without leaving some testimony of his courage and generosity. If then Hanibal,
a person of that great Experience and Conduct, at the head of a great Army, chose
rather to have had things determined by treaty and accommodation, than Battel; upon
the loss of which, the wealth and liberty of his Country depended: what is he to do,
who has not his courage nor experience? But men are subject to strange and imaginary
hopes, upon which reposing with too much confidence, they take their measures amiss,
and are many times ruined.


CHAP. XXVIII.
How much it is for the interest of all Governments that all injury be punished,
whether against the publick, or particular persons.
IT is easily known to what men are often transported by choler and indignation, by
what hapned to the Romans, when they sent the three Fabii Embassadors towards the
Gauls, who were entered into Tuscany, and had laid siege to Clusium. For the Clusians
being besieged, sent to the Romans to relieve them, and the Romans sent to the French to
require them in the name of the people of Rome, to withdraw their forces out of Tuscany;
The Roman Embassadors arrived at the Army, but being better Soldiers than Orators,

when the Armies came to engage, they put themselves at the head of the Clusians, to
fight against the French, which being observed by the French, turn'd all their former hatred
to the Tuscans, upon the Romans, which was much encreased after they had sent Embassa|dors
to complain of it at Rome, and to require that those who had committed that fault,
might be delivered up into their hands, to make satisfaction for their offence. But instead
of granting their demands, or punishing their delinquency themselves, they were created
Tribunes with Consular authority. Which coming afterwards to the Ears of the French,
finding those persons advanced, who ought rather to have been punished, they interpre|ted
it as done in affront to them, and being enflamed with anger and disdain, they marched
directly to Rome, assaulted and took it, all but the Capitol, which hapned to them for
nothing, but that the Romans (when their Embassadors had contra jus gentium, fought
against the French) had been so far from doing them justice, that the said Embassadors
were advanced and preferred. For which reason, a Prince and Commonwealth is to
take care that no such injury be done, not only to a Nation, or Commonalty, but to any
particular person; for if a man be highly offended either by a State, or private person,
and has not the satisfaction he desires, if it be in a Republick, he ceases not to pursue his
revenge, though with the ruine of the State. If it be under a Monarchy, and he finds
himself touched in point of honour, if he has the least spark of generosity in him, he
will never be quiet till he be revenged, though with never so much prejudice to himself,
of which case we cannot have an apter and truer example, than in Philip of Macedon, the
Father of Alexander the great. Philip had in his Court a young Gentleman of very ex|quisite
beauty called Pausanias, with whom Attalus (a great favourite of the said Phi|lips)
was enamoured; having tempted and solicited him many times to satisfie his passion,
and found him always averse, he resolved to do that by force or surprise, which he could
not do otherwise: To this purpose he made a solemn feast, and invited Pausanias, and
several other great persons: when they had filled themselves will with their good cheer,
he caused Pausanias to be taken from the Table, and carried to a private place, and not only
satisfied his own lust, but caused him to be vitiated by several others. Pausanias com|plained
heavily to King Philip, who having kept him for some time in hopes of doing him
justice, instead of performing, he advanced Attalus to the Government of a Province in
Greece: Which Pausanias resenting; in great anger that his adversary against whom he
had so long, and so earnestly solicited, should now be preferred, he began to turn his in|dignation
upon the King, who had refused to right him, rather than upon the person who
had done him the wrong: Insomuch that the very morning his Daughter was married to
Alexander of Epirus, as Philip was going to the Temple to celebrate the Nuptiality with
his Son Alexander on one hand of him, and his new Son-in-Law on the other, Pausanias
assaulted and slew him. This example is much like that of the Romans, and is to be ob|served
by any man that governs; who is never to despise any body so as not to believe but
he who is injured will revenge himself some time or other, though with never so much
danger and detriment to himself.


CHAP. XXIX.
Fortune casts a mist before peoples eyes, when she would not have
them oppose her designs.
IF the course of humane affairs be considered, it will appear, that many accidents, arise,
against which the Heavens do not suffer us to provide: And when this hapned at
Rome, where there was so much Virtue, and Piety, and Order, well may it happen more
frequently in those Cities and Provinces where there are no such things to be found. And
because the place is remarkable, to show the influence which the Heavens have upon human
affairs, Titus Livius has discoursed of it largely and efficaciously, telling us, That the Stars
to make us sensible of their power, first disposed the said Fabii (who were sent Embassa|dors
to the French) to fight as abovesaid, to the end that upon that occasion, they might
make War upon Rome. In the next place, they besotted the Romans so, as they did no|thing
worthy of the name of Romans in order to their defence, having banished Camillus
(the only person capable of standing them in stead) to Ardea. Again, when the French
were upon their march towards Rome, those who to repel the inroads of the Volsci, and
other bordering Enemies, had made Dictators many times, and with very good success,
made none upon the approach of the French. They were so slow likewise, and so remiss in

the raising of Men, and so tedious in furnishing them with Arms, that they could scarce
draw out any considerable force against them, till the Enemy was as far as the River
Allia which is within ten miles of Rome, and when their Army was come thither, it was
not encamped by the Tribunes with the usual diligence and discretion, they having neither
chosen a good place, nor drawn their line, nor fortified themselves with Trenches, nor
Stoccadoes as formerly, nor done any thing for their security, either humane, or divine:
When they came to fight, they drew up their men so awkwardly and untowardly, that
neither Soldier nor Officer did any thing worthy of the Discipline of the Romans, so that
the Battel was lost without any effusion of Blood, the Romans running at the very first
charge, the greatest part of them to Veii, the rest to Rome, and in such consternation,
that they fled directly to the Capitol before they went home to their houses. So that the
Senate without so much as thinking to defend their City, any more than the rest, never
caused the Gates to be shut, but part of them fled away, and part into the Capitol. There,
it is true they began to observe better orders than before, and managed things with less
confusion; They discharged all those that were unserviceable, and furnished themselves
with what provision they could get, that they might be able to hold out. The greatest
part of those useless people which were turn'd out of the Capitol, as old Men, Women,
and Children, fled into the Neighbouring Cities; the rest continued in Rome, and were
a prey to the French. So that if a man should have read their Exploits in former
times, and compared them with their actions then, he would not have believed them to be
the same people; and Titus Livius gives the reason after he had described all the disorders
aforesaid in these words, Adeo obcaecat animos fortuna, cum vim suam ingruentem refringi
non vult. So strangely does fortune blind other people, when she would not be obstructed in
her designs; and there can be nothing more true. Wherefore men are not so much to be
blamed or commended for their adversity or prosperity; for it is frequently seen, some are
hurried to ruine, and others advanced to great honour by the swing and impulse of their
fate, wisdom availing little against the misfortunes of the one, and folly as little against
the felicity of the other. When fortune designs any great matter, she makes choice of
some man of such courage and parts, as is able to discern when she presents him with an
occasion: and so on the otherside, when she intends any great destruction, she has her
Instruments ready to push on the wheel, and assist to her designs; and if there be any
man capable of obstructing them in the least, she either rids him out of the way, or
deprives him of all authority, and leaves him without any faculty to do good. And
this is abundantly cleared by this place, where Fortune, to amplifie Rome, and bring it
to that Grandeur to which it arrived afterwards; thought fit to debase it, (as we shall
show at large in the beginning of our third Book) but would not utterly destroy it:
For which reason, though she permitted Camillus to be banished, she would not suffer
him to be killed; though she let Rome be taken, she preserved the Capitol: Though she
intimidated the Romans, and would suffer them to do nothing wisely for the safety of the
City, yet she left them so much wisdom as secured the Capitol: That Rome might be
taken, she caused the greatest part of the Army that was defeated upon the Allia, to retire
to Veii, thereby cutting off all ways for the defence of Rome: But in the midst of her
Career, when she seem'd in such haste, and so impatient of its destruction, she prepared
every thing that was necessary for its preservation; having conveyed a good Army to Veii,
and Camillus to Ardea, that once again they might make head under a General whose repu|tation
was never fully'd with the ignominy of such a loss, but stood clear and entire for
the recovery of his Country: And here we might bring store of modern examples to
prove what is said, were not this sufficient without them. Yet this I shall assert again (and
by the occurrences in all History there is nothing more true) That men may second their
fortune, not resist it; and follow the order of her designs, but by no means defeat them:
Nevertheless men are not wholly to abandon themselves, because they know not her end;
for her ways being unknown and irregular, may possibly be at last for our good; so that
we are always to hope the best, and that hope is to preserve us in whatever troubles or
distresses we shall fall.



CHAP. XXX.
Princes and Republicks that are truly magnificent, do not make their Leagues
and Alliances with Money, but by their virtue, reputation, and force.
THe Romans were besieged in the Capitol, and though they were in expectation of
relief from Vii and Camillus, yet Famine constraining them, they proposed a par|ley
with the French, and were to pay a certain Sum of Money for their liberty; The Arti|cles
were sign'd, all things concluded, and Commissioners sent in to receive the Money,
when on a sudden Camillus appears with his Army, as if fortune had done it (says Livy).
Ut Romani auro redempti non viverent. That it might not be said the Romans had ever
been ransom'd: Which point is not only observable in this place, but in the whole progress
of the affairs of that Commonwealth, where it may be seen that they never got Town,
nor never made Peace with their Money; whatever they did, was bravely, and with their
Arms, which I think is more than can be said of any other State in the world. One of
the great marks of the puissance of this Commonwealth, was the manner of her living
with her Neighbors. When things are so managed in a Government, that the Neighbors
purchase its amity, and make themselves its Pensioners; 'tis a certain sign of the potency
of that Government: But when the Neighbors on the contrary receive Money from it,
'tis as infallible a sign of its weakness. If one reads the Roman History, he shall find the
Massilians, the Edui, the Rhodians, Hiero of Syracuse, and Massiissa, as they were Neigh|bors,
so they were Tributaries to the Romans, contributing to their expences, and Taxes
as there was occasion, without expectation of any other recompence, but protection.
Where a Prince or Commonwealth is weak, it is otherwise, as it appeared by our own
City of Florence, which in former times when it was in its greatest reputation, paid annual
stipends to most of the little Governments in Romania, besides what was received by the
Perugians, Castellans, and all their other Neighbors; whereas had it been strong, and
well Armed, it would have been quite otherwise, and all the rest would have given Flo|rence
Money for her protection. Nor were the Florentines singular in this case, the Vene|tians
did the same, and so did the King of France, who notwithstanding the greatness of
his Kingdom, was tributary to the Swizzers, and the King of England, which proceeded
from his having disarmed the people, and preferring a present opportunity of squeezing
them, and avoiding an imaginary danger, before the doing those things that might have
secured his State, and made it happy for ever; which practice though for some time it may
produce quiet and repose, yet the end is troubles, and losses, and ruine without remedy.
It would be too tedious to recount how often the Florentines, the Venetians, and the
Kingdom of France have bought off their Wars, and submitted to such dishonorable terms,
as the Romans could never be brought to but once. It would be too tedious to recount
how many Towns the Florentines, and the Venetians have brought with their Mony, which
have been the occasion of great disorders afterwards, and prov'd that what is gotten by
gold, is not to be kept with iron.
This point of generosity, and this manner of living the Romans observed very pun|ctually
whilst they were free; but after they fell under the Government of Emperors, and
those Emperors grew bad, they began to degenerate too, and prefer the shadow before the
Sun. They began to be Pensionaries first to the Parthians, then to the Germans, and by
degrees to all their Neighbors, which was the first step to the ruine of that great Empire;
and ll these inconveniences proceeded from the disarming of the people, and neglecting
to train them up to Military Discipline, from whence a greater mischief does arise; and that
is, That the nearer the Enemy approaches, the weaker, and more unable he finds you;
and therefore not being strong enough of your self to repel the Enemy from your borders,
you are forced to pay tribute to your Neighbors to undertake it for you; which being to
be raised and extorted from your Subjects, renders them more feeble and impotent. By
which means it happens sometimes that those States which are in this condition, may per|haps
make some little resistance upon the Frontiers, but if the Enemy passes that, all is
gone without remedy. But all this is disorderly, and unnatural; for as nature in all ani|mals
has fortified the vital and principal, and not extream parts of the body, because the
body can subsist without the one, but not without the other. So 'tis in all Governments,
the heart and center is to be fortified, rather than the Frontiers: But this was very ill
observed by the Florentines, for whenever an Enemy had past our borders, and took his
way towards the City, there was no body in a condition to oppose him. It was the same

with the Venetians not many years since, and had not their City been as it were swadled
with the Sea, it had been certainly destroyed. This indeed has not been seen so frequent|ly
in France, because it is so great a Kingdom, and too strong for most of its neighbours;
nevertheless when in the year 1513 they were invaded by the English, the whole Kingdom
trembled, and the King of France himself, and many others were of opinion, that if he
lost one Battel, the whole Kingdom was gone. With the Romans it was quite contrary;
the nearer the Enemy approached the City, the stronger he found it: this was evident in
Hanibal's invasion, though he had forc'd his way into Italy, fought three great Battels with
the Romans, and beat them in every one, though they had lost so many brave Souldiers
and Officers, yet they were not only able to continue the War, but to conquer them atlast,
and all by fortifying the heart and center of their Country, and leaving the extremities to
shift for themselves: for the vitals and fundamentals of their State was the People of Rome,
the Country of the Latins, the neighbouring Cities that were in League, and their Colonies
from whence they drew so many Souldiers as were able to fight, and entertain the whole
World. And this Hanno the Carthaginian understood very well: for when after the Bat|tel
at Cannas Hanibal sent Mago to Carthage to give them an account of the particu|lars
of the Victory, Mago having exceedingly magnified the exploits of his Brother, and
debased the Condition of the Romans, Hanno interrupted him, and enquir'd whether any
of the Roman Cities, or any of their Confederates had revolted? whether any of their
Senators were come in to Hanibal? or whether they had sent any Embassadors to him to
treat? and when Mago denied that any thing of all this had passed, Hanno replyed, Hosti|um
ergo multum superest,  bellum tam integrum habemus, atque habuimus qua die Annibal
Italian est ingressus; There is work enough behind, and the War is as entire as when Hanibal
passed first into Italy. It is apparent therefore, both by what is said in this Chapter, and
what has been said often before, that there is great difference betwixt the present and an|cient
methods of the Romans; and if we seriously consider it, we shall not wonder that
so many Towns are taken and lost, and so many Governments subverted, as we have seen
in our days: for where discipline is neglected, and military virtue laid aside, all things are
committed wholly to Fortune, which being various and unconstant, produces various mu|tations;
and this vicissitude and unconstancy of affairs will continue till some excellent
person arises to restore the ancient discipline, and restrain fortune from giving such eviden|ces
of her power every hour of the day.


CHAP. XXXI.
How dangerous it is to believe Exiles too far.
I Think it not amiss in this place to shew how much it imports all persons not to give too
much credit to those who are banished, for many times they are but the practices and
stratagems of Princes and States. We have a memorable example of their inconstancy in
Livy, though something improper. When Alexander the Great passed into Asia with his
Army, Alexander of Epirus his Kinsman and Unckle passed with another into Italy, invi|ted
by the Exiles of Lucca, who put him in hopes that by their means he should be Master
of that whole Province: but when he was come into Italy, instead of assisting him, they
conspir'd against him, and slew him, upon promise of indempnity, and restitution of their
Estates. From whence we may learn what faith is to be given to such as are banished out
of their own Country: for as to their engagements, they are nothing; it is not to be
doubted but when ever they can return by any other means, they will leave you, and be|take
themselves to any body else, notwithstanding any promise or engagement to you; and
that which makes their promises and confidence the less to be trusted, is, because their ex|treme
passion and desire to come home, make them believe many things that are impossible,
and pretend many things that they do not believe: so that betwixt what they believe, and
what they pretend, they feed you with fair hopes, but if you depend upon them, you are
undone, your expence is all lost, and your whole enterprize miscarries; I shall only give you
an instance in the aforesaid Alexander, and Themistocles the Athenian; Themistocles being
in rebellion against the Athenians, fled into Asia to Darius, whom he solicited with large
promises to an expedition into Greece. Darius was persuaded, and passed into Greece, but
Themistocles being unable to make his promises good, either for shame of what he had done,
or fear of punishment for what he had not, he poisoned himself; and if Themistocles a man
of that Excellence and Virtue could delude the King, and promise more than he could

perform, how little are they to be trusted, who having no such thing to restrain them, give
themselves up wholly to their passion and desires? Princes therefore and States ought to
be very tender of undertaking any enterprize upon the encouragement of an Exile, for
they seldom succeed. And because it seldom happens that Towns are taken by intelligence
within, I shall discourse of it in my next Chapter, and add what variety of ways the Romans
used to come by their Conquests.


CHAP. XXXII.
How many several ways the Romans used to Conquer their Towns.
THe Romans being a martial people, and given wholly to war, they considered every
thing very diligently that might any ways conduce to the facilitating their designs;
whether it was matter of charge, or any thing else: for this reason they seldom attempted
any Town by the way of siege, because they thought the expence and incommodity of
that way would be more than could be recompenced by the taking it; so as they never
tried that whilst there was any other hopes; and in all their great Wars, there are but very
few examples of any long Leaguers by them. The ways which they took were common|ly
either by storm, or surrender: when they took a Town by storm, it was either by open
force, or stratagem. Open force was, when they made their attaque without battering the
walls, which they called Aggredi urbem cum Corona; To begirt a Town, because they drew
their whole Army round the Town, and fell on in all quarters, and in this manner it hap|pened
sometimes that they carried very considerable places at one Storm, as when Scipio
took new Carthage in Spain. If this way was ineffectual, they battered down the walls
with their Rams, and other, engines of War. Sometimes they min'd, and entred the
Towns under ground, as they did at Veii; sometimes that they might fight with the Enemy
upon equal terms, they built wooden Towers, or raised Mounts to the height of the walls
from whence they might plague and molest them within their Works. The besieged were
in most danger in the first case upon a general assault, for their walls were to be made good
in all places at once, and it fell out many times, that there were not men enough to supply
and relieve all parts; or if they had men enough to do that, they were not all of an equal
courage, and when any gave ground, the whole Town was like to be lost, and by this means
that way was often succesful. When this way miscarried, they seldom sate down before a
Town, or went formally to beleaguer it, because it could not be done but with greater ha|zard
to their Army, for their quarters being to be extended, and their guards round about
the Town, they must of necessity be thinner and weaker in some places, and unable to
make any considerable opposition, if the Enemy should make any considerable eruption, so
that the sudden and brisk way was prefer'd: when their walls were battered with their
Engines, those who were in the Town defended themselves much as we do now against
great Guns, by repairing their breaches as well as they could. Their way of defeating
their mines was by countermining, and opposing themselves personally against the Enemy,
or disturbing them with their inventions, as particularly, putting of feathers, and oyls, and
other stinking stuff into barrels of wood, they set them on fire, and then tumbled them
among the Enemy, that what with the fire, the smoak, and the stench, they might not be
able to endure them their Towers of wood, they destroyed commonly by throwing fire
into them; and then for the mounts which were raised against the walls, their way was to
dig under the walls, and steal away their earth, or by loosening the foundations of the mount,
till it all fell to the ground. But these ways of taking a Town are not long to be tried;
if they carried it not quickly, they raised their siege, and sought out some other way of
prosecuting the War, as Scipio did when he went over into Africk, for having assaulted
Utica, without any success, he altred his Counsels, raised his Siege, and addressed himself
wholly to the bringing the Carthaginian Army to an engagement; yet sometimes they
continued their Siege, as they did at Veii, Carthage, and Ierusalem: as to their way of
taking of Towns by fraud and intelligence, (as they took Paloepolis) the Romans and
others attempted many places after that manner, but they seldom succeeded; for those secret
correspondencies are easily discovered, and the least discovery spoils the whole design, because
the conspiracy is commonly discovered before it comes to execution, it either being unpracti|cable
in it self, or betrayed by the infidelity of some of the Conspirators, there being a neces|sity
of meeting and discoursing with such persons, as it is not lawful to discourse with, but

upon some specious occasion, But suppose it be not discovered in the management, there
are so many difficulties in putting it into action, that it is almost impossible to overcome
them; for if you come too soon, or too late, all is spoiled: if any noise be made, (as by
the geese in the Capitol) the least disorder, the least error or mistake destroys the whole
enterprize. Besides, these things being executed in the night, the darkness strikes a ter|ror
into the instruments, and the more, because they are commonly unacquainted with the
place or people which they are to attaque, and therefore every little noise or accident is
sufficient to confound them, and every trifling imagination will make them turn their
backs; but no body was so daring and succesful in these fraudulent and nocturnal designs
as Aratus Sicionius, though in the day-time he was but like other men, which was rather
from some secret virtue in him, than any excellence in the way. And as to the taking of
Towns by surrender, they either surrender freely, or by force. When they do it freely,
it is done out of some extrinsick necessity, (as when Capua surrendred to the Romans, for
fear of falling into the hands of the Samnites) or else out of desire to be well governed,
as being taken with the administration of that Prince to whom they surrender; and thus
it was with the Rhodians, the Massillians, and other Cities which gave themselves up
to the Romans upon no other inducement, but that they might live more happily under
the Roman Laws, and be under a better Constitution. But there are many Cities which
surrender by force, which force proceeds either from the fatigues and calamities of a te|dious
Siege, or from continual excursions and depredations to which they are subject;
and against which they have no other way to secure themselves. And then all the ways
we have mentioned, the Romans made more use of this, carrying on their wars with
their neighbours 450 years together, in this manner for the most part; for though they
tried all the other, they found this the more profitable and safe. In Sieges there is delay
and loss of time, in storms, hazard and danger; and uncertainty in conspiracies: but
in bringing things to a Battel, it has been seen that by beating the enemies Army,
they have got a whole Kingdom in a day, whereas an obstinate Town has cost them
several years.


CHAP. XXXIII.
How the Romans upon any Expedition, gave their Generals
general Commissions.
I Am of opinion, that to read the History of Livy, with any profit and advantage
we must consider not only the actions, but the whole means and process both of
the People and Senate of Rome. Among other things, it is very remarkable with
what authority they invested their Consuls, Dictators and Generals of their Armies,
and it was so great, that the Senate reserved to it self only the power of making
Peace, or new Wars as they saw occasion; all the rest was left to the discretion of
the Consul, who might fight, or not fight, assault this Town or that Town as he pleased,
without any contradiction.
This may be proved by many examples, by more especially by what hapned in an Ex|pedition
against the Tuscans; for Fabius the Consul having defeated the Enemy at Sutri,
resolving to pass the Forrest of Gimina with his Army, and invade Tuscany, he was so far
from receiving Orders from the Senate, or consulting them in the business, that he gave
them not the least notice, though the War was to be removed into another Country, and
like to be very dangerous; which appeared by the resolution of the Senate in that very
case; for having heard of his Victory at Sutri, and apprehending that he might fall upon
such counsels, and pass his Army into Tuscany, thorow that dangerous Forrest, they sent
two Embassadors to him to advise him from that Expedition; but they came too late,
for he was gone before, and having over-run the whole Country, and routed the Enemy,
instead of hindering his design, the Embassadors went back with the news of his Victory.
This custom of the Romans, if it be seriously considered, will be found to be very solid and
wise. For should the Senate have been consulted by their Generals upon every particular
occasion, and have expected all their Orders from them, it would have made their Gene|rals
less circumspect, and vigorous, because the honour of the Victory would not accrew
totally to them, but they must participate with the Senate. Besides, the Senate understood
very well that Fortune is various, and that many accidents and advantages happen which

cannot be known or improved by any but those who are present; so that if they should
desire to be consulted in things of which they can have no knowledge, they must of neces|sity
err, though they were persons of never so much experience and wisdom. Wherefore
they gave their General absolute power of disposing all things at his own will, and the
whole honour of the Expedition was to be his, that it might be a spur to prick on his di|ligence,
and a bridle to regulate his rashness. And this I have thought fit to insert, that I
might shew how much the famous Commonwealths in our times do differ from the Ro|mans,
particularly the Venetians and Florentines, who are so strict with their General, that
if a great Gun be but to be planted against a Town, the Senate must be advised, and give
order how, and from whence it is to play. But this custom deserves commendation as
much as the rest, which all together, have brought their affairs into that sad condition in
which they are at present.




THE
DISCOURSES
OF
Nicholas Machiavel,
CITIZEN, and SECRETARY
OF
FLORENCE,
Upon the
First Decade of TITVS LIVIVS.
LIBER III.

CHAP. I.
That a Sect or Commonwealth be long-liv'd, it is necessary to correct it often;
and reduce it towards its first Principles.
'TIS a certain truth, that the things of this World are determined, and a set time
appointed for their duration; but those run thorow the whole course which is
assigned them by their Stars, who keep their body in such order, that it may not
alter at all, or if it does, it is for the better. I speak now of mixt bodies, as
Commonwealths, and Sects, and I say, that those alterations are salutiferous, which reduce
them towards their first principles; and therefore the best ordered, and longest liv'd are
they, who (by their own orders) may be often renewed, or else by some accident (without
the help of the said orders) may tend to renovation: 'tis as clear as the day, that no bo|dies
of men are of long duration, unless they be renewed; and the way to renew them
(as is said before) is to reduce them to their principles. For the Fundamentals of all
Sects, Commonwealths and Kingdoms have always something of good in them, by means
of which they recover their first reputation and grandeur. And because in process of
time that goodness corrupts, that body must of necessity die, unless something intervenes
that reduces it to its first principles. The Physitian speaking of the body of man, tell us,
Quod quotidie aggregatur aliquid, quod quandoque indiget curatione; That there is not a day
passes, but it contracts something which afterwards will require to be cured. 'Tis the same
with the Body Politick; and as to them, I say that they are to be cured, by being renewed;
and they are renewed, partly by external accident, and partly by internal prudence. The
first happens as it were by destiny or fate, as that Rome should be taken by the French, that
thereby it might reassume its old customs and virtues, and revive its ancient Worship, Re|ligion

and Justice, which were superannuated and decayed, as appears very plain by the
description of their preparation against the French, in which it is declared by Titus Livius,
that upon the marching out of their Army, and investing their Tribunes with Consular
power, they observed no religious ceremony: at the same time they not only refused to
correct the three Fabii, who contra jus gentium had fought against the French, but created
them Tribunes. And it is easily to be presum'd that they made less account of the good
Laws and Constitutions ordained by Romulus and other wise Princes, than was reasonable
and (perhaps) necessary to preserve the liberty of their State. This foreign invasion hap|ned
to them therefore, that all the obsolete Laws of that City might be revived, and that
the people might be taught that it was necessary not only to maintain Religion and Justice,
but to respect their good Citizens, and esteem their vertue above the advantages which they
seemed to want, for want of their assistance. And it fell out exactly, for Rome was no
sooner taken, but they began to renew the Orders of their old Religion: they punished the
Fabii who had fought against the Law of Nations, and conceived so great a value for
Camillus, that the Senate and People both laid aside their old animosity, and plac'd the
whole burden of the Commonwealth upon his single shoulders. 'Tis necessary therefore
(as was said before) that men which live together under a Government, be often reminded
by these exterior or interior accidents. The interior way is when there is a Law which
takes an account of all people in that Corporation; or else when there is some excellent
person among them who by his virtuous example does the same thing, so that this happi|ness
results to a Commonwealth either by the virtue of some great person, or the autho|rity
of some Law. And as to this last, the Orders which reduc'd the Commonwealth to|wards
its first principles, were the Tribunes of the people, the Censors and all the other
Laws against the ambition and insolence of man; which Laws have need to be revived
and quickned by the virtue of some Citizen; who with great courage and generosity shall
put them in execution in despight of all the power of the delinquents. The most re|markable
executions before the taking of Rome by the French, were the death of Brutus
his Sons, the punishment of the Decem-viri, the execution of Sp. Melius: after the City
was sack'd by the French, the most considerable were the death of Manlius Captolinus, the
death of the Son of Manlius Torquatus, the prosecution of Papirius Cursor against. Fabius
the Master of his Horse, and the accusation against Scipio; which things being extraordi|nary,
were the more remarkable, and when ever any of them hapned, they reminded the
people of their beginning, and that they were to live according to Law. But when these
examples began to be more rare, men took occasion to grow worse, and their exorbitan|cies
were with more danger and tumult; for if in ten years space no examples be made,
nor no execution done, people begin to forget and despise the Laws, and unless something
happens that may remember them of the punishments, and infuse something of fear into
them, the Delinquents will grow so numerous that it will be dangerous to punish them.
To this purpose they who governed the State of Florence from the year 1434 to the year
1494 were wont to say, that it was necessary every five years to review the State; for other|wise
it would be very hard to maintain it: They call'd reviewing the State, reducing the
people to the same terror and awe, as they had upon them of old, when every man was
punished according to his crime, let his quality be what it would. But when the memory
of these punishments are lost, and suffered to go to decay, men take the confidence to at|tempt
any thing, and speak ill of whom they please, against which no remedy is so proper
as reducing them towards their first principles, which is to be done by the example of some
excellent person, inciting you to such executions, without dependance upon any Law; and
they are many times of so great reputation, that good men desire to imitate them, and
bad men are ashamed to live contrary to them. Those who in Rome liv'd after this man|ner
were Horatius Cocles, Scaevola, Fabritius, the two Decii, Regulus Attilius and some
others, whose rare and virtuous example had the same effect in Rome, that good Laws,
and good Customs would have had; and if every ten years some of those examples or
executions aforesaid had hapned in that City, the minds and manners of the people could
never have been so corrupted, but as those virtuous examples, and heroick punishments
grew seldom, and scarce, so corruption began to multiply, for after Regulus his time, there
was not any such example to be seen; and though the two Cato's succeeded, yet there was
such great distance betwixt them, that their examples could do but little good, especially
the last of the Cato's, who finding the greatest part of the City debauched, could not work
any considerable reformation upon them. And so much for Civil Governments; as to
the conservation of Sects, the same renovation is necessary, as may appear by the example
of the Roman Religion, which would doubtless have been lost before this, had it not been
reduced towards its first principle by St. Francis and St. Dominick, who by their poverty,

and Christian-like examples revived it in the minds of men, where it was almost effaced;
and prevailed that the loosness and depravity of the Prelates and Cardinals did not ruine it;
for men seeing them live in that indigence and poverty; by confessing their sins to them,
and hearing them preach, they began to learn meekness and charity, and obedience; not
to upbraid people by their vices, but to leave them to God, whereas their lives must neces|sarily
be bad, who neither see nor feel what punishment is. So then it is this renovation
and reduction to its first principles, that has, and does still maintain our Religion. And as
to Kingdoms, they as well as Commonwealths have occasion to reform, and reduce as the
other; which course has been of no small advantage to the Kingdom of France; for that
Kingdom living under Laws and Customs more than any other, the said Laws and Customs
are preserved and executed by Parliaments, and especially by that of Paris, which revives
them every time it makes out process against any great Person, or opposes the King in its
arrests: and hitherto it has preserv'd it self by its severity against Delinquents, without re|gard
to the greatness of their quality, whereas should they pass unpunished, they would
multiply so fast, that they would become incorrigible in a short time, and not to be reform'd
but with the disorder, if not the dissolution of the whole Government. We may con|clude
therefore, that there is no safer way of preserving a Commonwealth, Kingdom or
Sect, than by reforming and reducing them to their primitive reputation, which is to be
done rather by good Laws, and examples at home, than foreign force; for though that
way be effectual sometimes, (as it was in Rome) yet it is so uncertain and dangerous, it is
not to be desired. And to demonstrate how much particular examples have conduced to
the grandeur of Rome, and what great effect they have wrought, I shall make them the
subject of my discourse in this third Book; and although among them some great exam|ples
might be produced, which have been exhibited by Kings, yet History having spoken
of them so largely, I shall pass them by without speaking any thing of them but what be|longs
to their own private advantage. And begin with Brutus the Father of the liberty
of the Romans.


CHAP. II.
'Tis the part of a wise man sometimes to pretend himself a fool.
NO man was ever so commendable for his wisdom and prudence, as Iunius Brutus for
counterfeiting the fool. For though Livy gives us but one reason why he did so, and
that is, that under that contempt he might live quietly, and enjoy his patrimony in peace;
yet it is probable by his ways of proceeding, that he did it, that thereby he might be less un|der
the observation of the Kings, and have fairer advantage of expelling them, and de|livering
his Country, when occasion should be offered. And that this was in his thoughts,
may be presumed from his interpretation of the Oracle of Apollo, to which when the Tar|quins
repair'd to understand which of them should succeed in the Government, it being
answered that the Government should come to him who first kissed his Mother, the Tar|quins
thought it not to be accomplished till they came to Rome; but Brutus pretending to
slip, fell down upon the ground, and kissed it, as the common Mother of us all. And af|terwards
upon the death of Lucretia in the presence of her Father, and Husband, and
Kindred, he was the first that drew the dagger out of the wound, and conjured all the
slanders by, that for the future they should never suffer a King in Rome. This example
may be followed by those who are disguisted with their Prince, but so as first to consider
their own power exactly, and if they find it sufficient, they may profess themselves pub|lickly,
and declare open War; and it is the most safe, and most honourable way: but if their
force be but small, and they find themselves that way too weak, they are with all industry
to endeavour to insinuate with the Tyrant, serving him in his pleasures, applauding him
in all his actions and words, and imitating him in every thing he does. By this means
you shall be secure from danger, enjoy all the pleasures and delights of the Court, and be
ready for any occasion of effecting your designs. Others are of opinion that you keep such
a distance with the Prince, as that you be neither so near him as to be covered with his
ruines, nor so remote, but that you may take the advantage of his destruction to advance
yourself; and this middle way was certainly the best, if it were easie to be kept, but be|cause
I think it impossible, it is necessary to take to one of the other two, and either to re|move
your self quite, or get in as near him as you can; he who does otherwise, is in a
great deal of danger, especially if he be a man of any Eminence and Estate: for it is not

enough to say, I expect nothing, I desire neither honour nor preferment, I had rather live
at ease, without any controversie or trouble, for those sayings are oftner heard than be|lieved:
nor can great men, if they did really desire it, continue in that condition, because no
body believes them, and no body will suffer them. A man is therefore rather to play the fool
like Brutus, and he does it abundantly that flatters and applauds every thing his Prince sees,
or speaks, or does, how contrary soever it be to his own judgment and mind. And as Bru|tus
was wise in pretending that folly; till occasion was offered for the deliverance of his
Country, so he was a severe assertor of its liberty, when obtained, of which severity we
shall speak in the next Chapter.


CHAP. III.
The liberty newly acquired, could not have been preserved, but by the execution
of Brutus his Sons.
THe severity of Brutus in maintaining that liberty which he had procur'd in Rome, was
no less necessary than profitable. 'Tis an example well worthy to be transmitted to
posterity, to see a Father sitting in judgment upon his Sons, and not only sentence them
to death, but be present, and a spectator of their execution. But so it is decreed, and it
will be found so by all that are conversant in Antiquity, that upon any alteration of Go|vernment,
(whether from better to worse, or worse to better, it is the same thing) it is
necessary severe example should be made of somebody that opposed it, if you desire the
new form would be preserved. In short, this I affirm, that whoever sets up a Tyranny,
cannot hope to maintain it, but by cutting off Brutus; and whoever sets up a free State, is
as unlike to continue it, but by taking off Brutus his Sons; and of this we have discoursed
so largely before, there is no need of enlarging here, I shall add only one example which
hapned in our Country and times. Piero Soderini having restored the liberty of Florence
believed that by his patience and moderation he could have mollified their minds, who like
the Sons of Brutus were impatient of reviving the old tyranny again. But he was highly
mistaken, and so much the more to blame, by how much he was a wise man, and knew well
enough that there was a necessity of removing such persons as by their ambition opposed
themselves against him; yet though there was a necessity to do it, and he had so fair an occa|sion,
he let it pass, and never made use of it: for besides that, he believed his patience and
good nature would have wrought upon some, and his munificence and bounty upon others
(as he often declared among his friends) he had an opinion, that to make a stout and vigo|rous
opposition against his Enemies, it would be necessary for him to take upon him an
extraordinary authority, which would not only be a breach of the Laws, but of the civil e|quality
of the City: and if he should assume such a power, and perhaps exercise it well him|self,
yet the people would be so terrified thereby, that after his death they would never agree
to the making their Gonfaloniere for life, which office he thought fit to have augmented and
maintained: this consideration, though wise and good in it self, was not prudent at that
time, because we are never to entertain a present mischief in hopes of a future good, espe|cially
when, for ought we know, that good may be opprest by that mischief: he ought ra|ther
to have had a care that the end of his intentions might have appeared for the good
and benefit of his Country, and not out of any particular ambition; and to have provi|ded
that whoever succeeded him afterwards in his dignity, should not be able to employ
that authority to the ruine of the State, which he was forc'd to take upon him to preserve
it. But the good man was mistaken in his first opinion, as not understanding that the ma|lice
of mankind is not to be extinguished with time, nor appeased with presents; for could
he have imitated the severity of Brutus, he had preserved his own dignity, and the liberty
of the State. But as it is a difficult thing to preserve the liberty of a State, so it is no less
difficult to preserve the authority of a King, as shall be shewn in the next Chapter.



CHAP. IV.
A Prince is never safe in his new Conquests, whilst they are in being whom
he dispossessed.
THe death of Tarquinius Priscus by the Sons of Ancus, and the death of Servins Tullius
by Tarquinius Superbus shews how dangerous it is to disposses any man of a King|dom,
and suffer him to live, though you endeavour by all means possible to cares him.
Tarquinius Priscus thought his Title unquestionable, being made King by the People, and
confirmed by the Senate; nor could it enter into his thoughts that the malice and indig|nation
of the Sons of Ancus should be so great, as to keep them from submitting to that
wherewith the whole City of Rome was contented. Servius Tullius was mistaken in the
same manner, in thinking with new favours and obligations to have pacified the Sons of
Tarquin. So that from the first example, a Prince may take warning, and not delude him|self
with an opinion he is safe, whilst any of them are living whom he dispossessed; and
from the second he may inform himself, that old injuries are never cancelled by new fa|vours,
especially if the favours be not equivalent to the injury. And without doubt Ser|vius
Tullius was ill advised to believe that the Sons of Tarquin would be content to be his
Sons-in-Law, when it was their due to be his King. And this ambition, and impatience to
govern, is so great and insatiable in mankind, that it not only affects those persons who
have some right and expectation to govern, but those likewise who in reason can have no
such expectancy, as in the example of Tullia the Daughter of Servius, but married to one
of the Tarquins: which Tullia was so enflamed with a desire of governing, that not con|tented
with being a King's Daughter, transported with rage, contrary to all silial duty and
affection, she incited her Husband against her Father, and forc'd him into a conspiracy, not
only against his Kingdom, but Life. Whereas if Tarquinius Priscus and Servius Tullius
had known how to have secured themselves against those they had supplanted, they had
neither lost their Kingdoms nor Lives. But Tarquinius Superbus was expell'd for not ob|serving
the Laws and Practices of the ancient Kings his Predecessors, as shall appear in the
next Chapter.


CHAP. V.
How a King may lose his Kingdom, though he comes to it by inheritance.
TArquinius Superbus seemed to have secure possession of the Kingdom upon the death of
Servius Tullius, who dying without heirs, left him nothing of that trouble and vexa|tion
which his Predecessors encountred. For although the way by which he came to the
Government was irregular and abominable; nevertheless had he followed the steps of his
Predecessors, and observed their old rules, he would not have run himself so fatally in
to the displeasure of the Senate and People, nor have provoked them to have been so di|ligent
in his expulsion. Nor is it to be believed that his Son Sextus his deflowring of
Lucretia was the chief cause that he lost his Kingdom, but his infraction of the Laws, his
tyranny, his usurpation upon the Senate, and his ingrossing all authority to himself: for
he had brought things to that pass, that those affairs which were formerly debated pub|lickly
by the Senate, and according to their sentiment and order were put in execution,
were now transacted and determined privately in his own Palace, with great dissatisfaction
and offence; so that in a short time Rome was deprived of the liberty which it injoyed
under other Kings: nor was it enough for him to disoblige the Senate, but he run himself
into the odium of the people, harassing them out by mechanick and servile imployments
to which they had never been used in the days of his Predecessors; by which cruel and in|solent
actions he had so incensed and inflamed the minds of the Romans against him, that
they were ready for rebellion the first opportunity that offered it self; and if that accident
had not hapned to Lucretia, as soon as any other had fallen out, it would have had the same
effect. And if Tarquin had governed, and lived according to the example of his Ance|stors,
and his Son Sextus had committed that error, Brutus and Collatinus would have ad|dressed
themselves to Tarquin (and not to the people of Rome) for justice against his Son.
Let Princes therefore observe that they begin to ruine their own dignity and power, when

they first go about to transgress and violate the old Laws and Customs of their Ancestors:
and if after they are removed, and dispossessed of their authority, they should grow so
wise as to understand the felicity of governing a Kingdom with good Counsel, their
loss would be more insupportable, and they would condemn themselves to a greater pu|nishment
than any body else would condemn them; for 'tis easier to be beloved by good
people, than bad, and to obey Laws, than to command them; and to understand the way
by which this is to be done, they have no more to do, but to observe the lives of good Prin|ces,
as Timoleon the Corinthian, Aratus Sicionius and others, in which they will find so
much ease and security to him that governs, and them that are governed, that they will be
tempted to imitate them, if for nothing but the easiness of it. For when men are governed
well, they desire no other liberty; as it hapned to the people who were governed by the
two persons above named, whom they compelled to continue their Princes whilst they
lived, though they endeavoured several times to have laid down, and betaken themselves
to a private condition. And because in this and the two precedent Chapters, we have dis|coursed
of the hatred contracted against Princes, and the Conspiracy of the Sons of Bru|tus
against the State, and others against Tarquinius Priscus, and Servius Tullius, I think
it not amiss to speak of Conspiracies more largely in my next Chapter, as being a subject
well worth the observation both of Princes and private Persons.


CHAP. VI.
Of Conspiracies.
I Did not think it inconvenient in this place to discourse something of Conspiracies, see|ing
they are things of such consequence and danger, both to Princes  private Persons;
for by them more Princes have lost their States and their Lives than by open War;
ad the reason is, because few persons are qualified to make War, but every body can con|spire.
On the other side, for a private person, no enterprize is more dangerous and rash; for
let him manage it as wisely as he can, it is full of difficulty, and uncertainty of success; and
from hence it is that among so many Conspiracies there are so few which arrive at the end
that was designed. To the end therefore that Princes may learn how to defend them|selves;
and private persons might be more cautious of engaging themselves in them, but
may rather be contented to live quietly under the Government where they are placed, I
shall enlarge upon the subject, and leave nothing behind that is considerable for the docu|ment
either of the one or the other. It is a certain truth, and well said of Cornelius Taci|tus,
that men are to pay an honour and respect to things past, and obedience to things
present: that they ought to desire good Princes, but when they are once in authority,
they are to be endur'd, and those who go about to conspire against them, do most com|monly
ruine themselves or their Country.
To come therefore to the point, we are first to consider against whom these Conspiracies
are made, and we shall find them either against their Country, or Prince: and of these two
sorts of Conspiracies we shall discourse at present, because of those which are entred into, to
deliver up a besieged Town to the Enemy, or upon such occasion, we have spoken amply
before. And first of the Conjurations against a Prince, and the occasions of them, which
are many, but one of more importance than all the rest, and that is the hatred of the peo|ple:
for that Prince who has contracted the universal odium of the people, may with
reason believe that some of those whom he has offended will study to revenge themselves;
and they will be the more industrious in it, by how much they observe the general discon|tent
and animosity against him. A Prince therefore is by all means possible to prevent the
hatred of the People, (but having spoken of it before, I shall not enlarge upon it again.)
For by keeping himself from the general hatred, particular offences will not be able to a|mount
to a War; first, because all men have not the same resentment, and will not put
themselves in danger to revenge an injury; and then because if the discontented were all
of a mind, and had power to do it, yet they are discouraged by the affection which they
observe in the multitude towards their Prince. The injury done by the Prince, is either
upon the Estate, Blood, or Honour of the Subject: where the injury extends to Blood,
threatning is very dangerous, and much more than down-right execution; for when a
man is kill'd, he is past thinking of revenge, and those who are alive will quickly forget
him; but when a man is threatned, and finds himself under a necessity of suffering, or do|ing

something extraordinary, he becomes immediately dangerous, and ought to be regar|ded
by the Prince, as I shall shew hereafter. Next to this necessity for the preservation of
ones life; Honour and Estate are the two tenderest points in which men are soonest offended,
and of which the Prince is likewise to have a particular care, for no man can be pillaged so
perfectly, but he will have a Knife left to revenge himself; nor no man can be dishonoured
to such a degree of debasement, but he will have courage enough left to attempt something
in revenge; and in point of honour, no injury goes so near a man as what reflects upon
the woman; and next to that, is to be despised. This was it that arm'd Pausanias against
Philip of Macedon, and many other Subjects against many other Princes. In our times Iu|lius
Belanti had never conspired against Pandolfus Tyrant of Siena, had he not first given
him his Daughter to Wife, and then taken her from him again, as we shall shew more at
large hereafter. The great motive of the Conjuration of the Pazzi against the Medici
was the Patrimony of Giovanni Bonromei, which was given from them by the award of
the Medici. But there is another motive (and that no small one) which makes people
conspire against their Prince, and that is a desire of rescuing their Country from tyranny
and usurpation. This was it which set Brutus and Cassius at work against Caesar. This
was it which excited others against Phalaris, Dyonisius, c. and against this there is no re|medy,
but depositing their usurpations, and because there are few will do that, there are
but few which escape the ill consequence.
Ad Generum Cereris, sine caede,  sanguine pauci
Descendunt Reges,  sicca morte Tyranni.
Slaughter and Blood pursues, he seldom lies
Dry in his Coffin that a Tyrant dies.
But in Conspiracies, as I said before, the dangers are so great and various, that there is
not only a hazard in the designing, management, and execution, but even after the execu|tion
is done. The Conspirators are either one or more; one cannot properly be called a
Conspiracy, but a firm resolution in a single person to make away his Prince; this way of
Conspiracy is more secure than the other, because till it comes to execution, it can never be
known, no body being privy to his secret, and therefore no danger of coming to the ears
of the Prince. These kind of resolutions may fall into the heart of any man, great or
small, noble or ignoble, favourites or strangers: no man but some time or other may have
access to his Prince, and he that has opportunity to speak with him, has opportunity to do
worse. Pausanias murdered Philip of Macedon as he was going to the Temple attended
with a thousand of his Guards, and walking betwixt his own Son and his Son in Law; but
Pausanias was a Gentleman, and very conversant at Court, but there was a poor con|temptible
Spaniard who stabb'd Ferdinand King of Spain in the Neck, and though the
wound was not mortal, yet it was enough to shew us that there is no man so inconsidera|ble,
but if he has courage to undertake, he may have opportunity to it: Dervis a Turkish
Priest drew his Sword upon Bajazet Father to this Present Emperor, and though he did not
kill him, yet it was not for want either of courage or opportunity. Nor is it to be doubt|ed
but there are many ill enough disposed, who wish from their hearts to be revenged
on their Tyrants, but there are few that dare venture, and scarce one of those few but dies
in the attempt, and no man will expose himself where there is no hopes to escape. But
enough of this pertinacious malevolence in a single person, we will speak now of Conspi|racies
betwixt a number: I say that in History all Conspiracies are found to be acted by
great Persons, and such as have familiarity with their Prince: for others, unless they be mad
men or fools, will never attempt it, because people that are weak,  remote from the Court,
are destitute of all those hopes and conveniences that are requisite for the execution of such
a design. First, men of slender fortune or interest cannot impart themselves freely, no body
will be true them, because no man can concur with them upon any of those hopes which
do usually encourage men to the undertaking of any great danger; so that they can hard|ly
communicate to two or three persons, but one of them is an informer, and the other are
ruined. But if they should be so happy as not to be betrayed, the execution is attended
with so many difficulties by reason of the difficulty of their access, that it is impossible but
they must miscarry: and if great persons, and such as are very conversant with their Prince
are subject to such hazards, those doubtless must be much more who are under none of those
qualifications. Wherefore, when men of mean fortune, or little access at Court consider
their own weakness and inability, they are discouraged from any such designs; and if at
any time they be offended, and would do their Prince a mischief, they content themselves

with libelling and railing, and expect when persons of greater access and capacity should
revenge them upon his person, and if any of these persons are so far transported, as to
attempt any thing of this nature, their good will is more to be commended than their discre|tion.
We see then, where any great Conspiracy has been made, it has been by great per|sons,
and such as have been familiar with their Prince, and that as often upon the score of
benefits, as injuries received; so it was in the Conspiracy of Perennius against Commodus,
Plautianus against Severus, Sejanus against Tiberius, all of them preferred by their several
Emperors, and advanced to such Honours, Authority and Estates, that their power seem'd
to want nothing of perfection, but the Imperial Ensigns, and that they might have them
as well as the rest, they conspired every one of them against their Prince, and their Conspi|racies
had such ends as their ingratitude deserved. However, in the memory of our Fa|thers
the Conspiracy of Giacopo d' Apiano against Messer Piero Gambacorti Prince of Pisa
had a better end; for the said Giacopo having been brought up, and caressed, and advan|ced
by the said Piero deposed his Benefactor, and took away his Government for his pains.
Another of the same nature was that of Coppola in our days against Ferdinand of Arragon,
though it had not the same success; for Coppol being arrived at that height of Authori|ty,
that there was nothing but the bare name wanting to make him King, he attempted
for that, and lost his life in the business. And certainly if any Conspiracy might have suc|ceeded,
it was his, being a person as powerful as the King himself, and seconded with all
the conveniences he could desire: but the same greediness of dominion that blinded him
in the undertaking, blinded him in the prosecution of his design; for had it been mana|ged
with the least prudence, it would have been impossible to have miscarried.
A Prince therefore who would preserve himself against Conspiracy, is to have an eye
rather upon those he has obliged, than those he has offended; for they that are offended
have not those frequent opportunities that the other have; and for the disposition, it is
much alike, the desire of dominion being as great if not greater than the desire of revenge;
so then authority is to be given to his friends with that caution, that there be always some
space or interval left betwixt the preferment of the Favourite, and the sovereignty of the
Prince, lest if his ambition should not be satisfied, he should aspire immediately at the
Crown. But to return to our design, I say, that Conspiratours being to be great men, and
such as have easie access to the Prince, we are now to enquire into the successes of their
Plots, and see what have been the causes of their prosperity or miscarriage. And because
(as I said before) the danger is considerable in the management, execution, and afterwards;
for that reason there are very few of them that arrive at their proposed end. In their con|trivances
and consultations there is such extraordinary danger, that unless they be carried
on with singular caution and prudence, they will be easily discovered; and they are disco|vered
two ways, either by down-right impeachment, or by conjecture and presumption.
Impeachment proceeds either from infidelity or folly in those persons with whom you have
communicated; infidelity is easily found, for you cannot communicate in that nature but
with such of your Confidents as you suppose will venture their lives for you; or else with
such persons as are dissatisfied with the Government: of such kind of Confidents, one or
two may possibly be found, but when you begin to multiply them, and commit your secret
to more, you must necessarily be betrayed; for their affection to you must be very great, if
the apprehension of the danger, and the fear of the punishment do not deter them: be|sides,
men are many times mistaken in the affection of their friends; for they can never
be assured of them till they have made experiment, and to make experiment in such ways
as this, is exceedingly dangerous, and if perchance you have had trial of them in some
other matters of importance in which they have behaved themselves faithfully and well,
yet you can take no true measures from that, because this surpasses all other dangers what|soever.
If you presume upon his discontent, animosity to his Prince, you may be ca|sily
deceived, for as soon as you have discovered your design, you have given him a power
to reconcile himself, and his rancour must be very great, or your influence extraordinary to
keep him faithful: hence it is that many Conspiracies are discovered, and as it were nipp'd
in the Bud; and when any of them are kept private where many persons are privy, 'tis
look'd upon as a miracle, as that of Piso against Nero, and in our times that of the Pazzi
against Lorenzo, and Giuliano de Medici, in which though fifty were concerned, it was ne|ver
discovered till it came to execution; for discoveries by indiscretion, they happen when
one of the Conspirators talks carelesly, so as some servant or third person picks it out, as it
hapned to the Sons of Brutus, who in their Negotiations with Tarquin's Embassadors, were
over-heard, and accused by one of the Servants: another way is when out of levity you
communicate with some Child or Woman that you love, or such other incontinent person,
as Dinus did, who being (with Philotas) entred into a Conspiracy against Alexander the

Great, imparted it to a Boy that he loved, called Ficomachus who told it to his Brother
Cibalinus, and Cibalinus discovered it to the King. As to discoveries by circumstances
and conjecture, we have an example in the Pisonian Conspiracy against Nero, in which
Scevinus one of the Conspirators having the day before Nero was to have been murther'd,
made his Will, ordered Milichius his Freeman to furbish up his old rusty Sword, enfran|chised
all his Slaves, distributed Mony among them, and caused Plagets and Lgatures to
be made to bind up Wounds, he gave occasion of conjecture to Milichius, who accused him
thereupon to Nero, and Order being given for his apprehension, Scevinus was taken into
custody, and with him Natalis another of the Conspirators, who had been observed to
have talked privately with him a long time the day before, and not agreeing about their
discourse, they contradicted one another, and were forced to confess all.
From these occasions of discovery it is impossible to be secur'd, but either by malice, im|prudence,
or inadvertency, all will out when ever the Conspirators exceed the number of
three or four. For if more than one of them be taken, 'tis impossible but they must inter|fere,
because two people cannot hang together so exactly in a Story. If there be but one
apprehended, and he be a stout man, perhaps he may have that constancy and resolution
as to conceal his Confederates; but then his Confederates must have as much courage as
he, and not discover themselves by their slight; for whose heart soever fails, whether his
that is apprehended, or his that is escaped, 'tis the same thing, for the Plot is discovered.
That example which is mentioned by Titus Livius is very rare and unusual, where in a
Conspiracy against Girolamo King of Syracuse, he speaks of one of the Conspirators called
Theodorus, who being seized, concealed his accomplices with incomparable constancy, and
accused all the Kings Friends; and his Companions were so confident in his courage, that
none of them fled, or made the least discovery by their fear. These are the dangers which
are to be pass'd in the conduct or management of an Enterprize, before it comes to execu|tion;
and as there are dangers, so there are ways of evading them.
The first, the surest, and indeed the only way is not to give your Confederates time to
discover you, but to communicate the business to them when it is just ready for execution,
and not before. Those who take that course, are free from the danger of Threatnings and
Negotiations, and commonly from all the rest; and have been observed frequently to come
to good end, and there is no man that is wise, but would carry it so if he could. I shall
give you only two Examples. Nelimatus being unable to endure the Tyranny of Aristoti|mus
King of Epirus, got several of his Friends and Relations together into his house, and
exhorting them to the deliverance of their Country, some of them desired them to consi|der,
and prepare themselves; whereupon Nelimatus caused his Servants to make fast the
doors, and protested to all the whole Company, that they should swear to go immediately
about it, or he would deliver them up Prisoners to Aristotimus, upon which they all took
the Oath, and falling incontinently to the work, they effected their design, as Nelimatus
had contriv'd it. One of the Magi having by fraud possessed himself of the Kingdom of
Persia, and Orthanus a great Person of that Kingdom, having discovered the cheat, he had
a conference with six others of his own quality, to contrive how they might rescue their
Country from the Tyranny of that Usurper, and (as in the case before) when some of them
desired time, Darius (one of the six) stood up and declared boldly, That if they would
not execute it presently, he would accuse them every one, and doing it forthwith, they
prospered accordingly. Not unlike these two, was the way which the Aetolians used in
the Assassination of Nabis the Tyrant of Sparta: They sent one of their Citizens called
Alexamenes to him with 30 Horse, 200 Foot under a pretence of a supply, comman|ding
the Soldiers to be obedient to the orders of their chief Officers, but acquainted no|body
with the design but Alexamenes himself. Alexamenes marched to Sparta with his
Forces, but communicating nothing of his instructions, till they were fit to be executed,
he did his business, and the Tyrant was slain; by which reservedness they avoided the first
dangers of being discovered, which are obvious in the management, and whoever takes
the same course, shall avoid them as well as they. Piso (whom I have mention'd before)
was a man of honour and reputation, a great intimate of Nero's, and one in whom he
placed a great deal of confidence. Nero visited him often, and was many times treated
very magnificently in his Garden: Piso by virtue of this intimacy was able to make choice
of such Complices as were stout and couragious, and disposed to such an Exploit (which
for great men to do, is no difficult matter) and when occasion was offered, to break the
business to them so suddenly, that having no time either to deliberate or deny him, he must
necessarily succeed; and he who examines all the other Examples that are mentioned, will
find very few, but have been managed the same way. But men of little experience in the
affairs of the world, do many times commit great errors, and more, when their designs

are extraordinary, as in this. A Plot then is never to be imparted, but upon necessity,
and when it is ripe for execution; and when you do communicate, do it but to one, and
that a person of whom you have had long experience, or one that is prompted by the
same interest and provocation as your self; and to find one person so, is much easier than
to find many, and by consequence that way is nothing so dangerous. Besides, if you
should be mistaken in your confidence, you have more remedy and defence, than where the
Conspirators are several; for I have heard wise men say, that to a single person a man
may say any thing; (for if nothing be to be produced under your hand) your no, will be
as good as his yea: But writing is to be shun'd as a rock, for nothing is of so much con|viction,
as a note under a man's own hand. Plautianus desiring to murther Severus the
Emperor, and his Son Antoninus; committed the execution to Saturninus a Tribune, who
had more mind to betray, than obey him; but suspecting that when he came to accuse him,
Plautianus should have more credit than he, he desired a Warrant under his hand to con|firm
his Commission, which Plautianus granted, being blinded with ambition, whereby
it happen'd that he was accused, convicted, and condemned, whereas without that Note,
and some other circumstances, Plautianus would have been acquitted, and his accuser been
punished, so obstinately did Plautianus deny all. In the Pisonian Conspiracy, there was a
Woman called Epicaris, who had been formerly one of Nero's Misses. This Epicaris
thinking it of importance to bring in a Captain of certain Galleys which Nero kept for his
Guard, she communicated the Plot, but conceal'd the Conspirators, and the Captain be|traying
her, and accusing her to Nero, Epicaris maintained the contrary with such constan|cy,
that the Emperor was amaz'd, and discharged her. So then, he that communicates a
thing of this Nature to one, runs but these two dangers, either of being spontaneously
accused, and proof brought to make it good; or else being accused by accident and of
force, as when his Confederate is apprehended upon suspition, and impeaches him upon
the Rack, in both which cases there is something to be said; for in the first he may pretend
malice, in the second fear, and that the extremity of his torture constrained him to say
false: So that it is great wisdom to communicate with no body, till your designs be ripe
but to proceed according to the examples aforesaid; but if you must communicate, to do
it but to one alone, and by himself; in which though there be some danger, yet there is
much less than where you communicate with many. Another way, and not unlike this,
is when the fury or violence of a Tyrant necessitates you to do that to him, which other|wise
he would be sure to do to you; and sometimes it is so sudden and fierce, it leaves you
scarce time to think of securing your self. This is an exigence and necessity that has most
commonly a good end, and to prove it, I will produce two examples, and no more. Com|modus
the Emperour had two Captains of his Guards (one of them called Lettus,, and
the other Elettus) particularly in his favour, and Martia was the most intimate of his
Concubines. They having taken the liberty to admonish him of his ill Courses, and the
reflection his ill conversation had both upon his Person and Government, he resolved to rid
himself of his Monitors, and to that end writ down the names of Martia, Lettus, Elettus,
and others (who he designed should be put to death the next night) and put the Note un|der
his Pillow. Being gone out into a Bath, a Child that he lov'd exceedingly, being
rummaging about the room, happened upon this Paper, and going out with it in his
hand, Martia met him by accident, took it from him, read it, sent it immediately to
Lettus and Elettus, who being sensible of their danger, resolved to prevent him, and
without more ado, killed Commodus in the Evening.
Antoninus Caracalla the Emperor, was with his Army in Mesopotamia, and having made
Macrinus his General (a better Statesman than Soldier) it hapned (as it does to all Prin|ces
that are wicked) that he began to apprehend (what he knew he deserved) that some
body conspired against him. To be more certain, he writ privately to a friend (called
Maternianus) in Rome, to consult the Astrologers, and give him notice whether any body
was contriving against the Empire. Maternianus writ him word he had consulted them,
that there were those who did aspire at the Empire, and that Macrinus was the man. This
Letter coming by accident to the hands of Macrinus, before the Emperor saw it, he
found the necessity that was upon him either to kill or be kill'd; and thereupon committed
the execution to a confident of his call'd Martialis (whose Brother Antoninus had slain
not many days before) who kill'd him accordingly. We see then that this necessity which
allows us no time, has the same effect in a manner with the course which was taken by
Nelimatus of Epirus, as I have mentioned before. We see likewise, that (as I said in the
beginning of these discourses) that Commination and threatning does a Prince more mis|chief,
and are the occasion of more Plots, than violence it self. A Prince therefore is to
have a care of that; to caress those that are about him, and keep them in their Allegiance

by his courtesie and kindness; if that will not do, he is to secure himself otherwise as well
as he can, but never to bring them into a condition of thinking themselves under a neces|sity
of killing or being kill'd. As to the dangers which attend the execution of a Plot,
they proceed either from a sudden alteration of Orders; a sudden defection of courage in
him that is to execute; some imprudence in the attempt; or some imperfection in the act,
as when all are not killed that were intended. And first we must understand that there is
nothing gives so much Embarrasment, and distraction to the action of men as new and
contradictory orders to be executed in an instant. and quite contrary to what was deter|mined
before. And if in any thing this variation be dangerous, it is in Martial affairs, and
in such things as we have now spoken of; for in those cases there is nothing so necessary
as that every man may know certainly his part, that beforehand he may contrive with
himself, and conclude upon all the circumstances of the Fact; whereas if they have fram'd
their designs, and fix'd upon their way, and immediately new Orders are brought repug|nant
to the former, it disturbs all, and the whole Plot must be ruined; so that it is better
to execute it according to the first Order, though there be something of inconvenience,
than to vary your Orders, with a thousand times more: But this is meant only where the
variation is sudden, for where you have time enough, it is not so dangerous. The Con|spiracy
of the Pazzi against Lorenzo and Giuliano de Medici is very well known. Their
first Orders were, That an entertainment should be made for the Cardinal of St. George,
to which the Medici should be invited, and killed. Every mans Office was assigned; some
were to kill them; some were to secure the Palace; and others to ride up and down the
City, and proclaim liberty to the people: It happened when the Pazzi, Medici, and Car|dinal
were altogether in the Cathedral in Florence at Divine Service, news was brought
that Iulian would not be at Dinner: Hereupon the Conspirators consulting again, it was
resolved to alter the Plot, and do that in the Church which was designed in the Chamber:
This sudden alteration, discomposed the whole order; for Giovan batista da Montesec|co
would not consent to add Sacriledge to his Murther, and commit it in the Church; up|on
which they were forced to appoint another in his place, and shift all their Agents from
one Office to another, and their time being too short to fix their resolutions, they commit|ted
so many errors in the execution, that all of them miscarried. And among the Conspi|rators,
when things come to be executed, their heart many times fails them, either out of
sudden reverence, or sudden fear; for the presence and Majesty of some Princes is so awe|ful,
it either mitigates or frightens the fury of the Executioner; Marius being taken and
kept Prisoner by the Minturnenses, they sent a Servant to kill him; but the poor slave was
so terrified at the sight of his Person, and the Memory of his Name, that his courage
fail'd, and he was not able to go thorow,; and if the consideration of his quality, and the
Majesty of his Countenance could do so much, in a person that was a Prisoner, and in di|stress;
how much more are they effectual in a free Prince, magnificently adorn'd, and as
nobly attended. Certainly such a sight is able to strike terror into the boldest person, and
work compassion in the most cruel miscreant.
Some there were who conspired against Sitalcis King of Thrace: The day was appointed
for the execution; they met at the place, where the Prince was; but when the stroke was
to be given, no body durst venture, they departed as they came, every body blamed one
another, but no body knew what was the impediment, and having attempted it often
with the same intimidation, they were discovered at last, and received punishment for an
offence which they might, but would not put in execution. Alfonso Duke of Ferrara had
two Brothers, who conspired against him, and employed Giannes a Priest and Chantor in
the said Dukes Chappel, to bring the Duke to them, which he did many times, and it was
in their power to to have killed him; but yet not any of them durst strike him, so that at
length they also were discovered, and received their reward. This remorse can proceed
from nothing but the terror of his presence, or the influence of his behaviour and huma|nity,
which compels them to mercy. But the defects and disappointments in these kind
of executions, proceed either from imprudence, or terror, with either of which, the minds
of the Conspirators being disturbed, they become so confused and distracted, they can
neither say, nor do any thing as they should. And that men are subject to those confu|sions
and surprizes, cannot be better demonstrated than by Livy's description of Alexame|nus
the Aetolian, of whom we have spoken before: For when the time was come for the
execution of his design against Nabis the Spartan, having imparted it to his friends, Livy
tells us, Collegit,  ipse animum, confusum tantae cogitatione rei. He recollected his mind,
which was in some measure confounded with the contemplation of the Enterprize For there
is no man, how resolute and bloody soever he be, but must be surprized and discomposed
in such cases as those, wherefore for such Exploits, experienced men, and such as have

been used to those kind of affairs, are to be chosen, and no other, though never so stout:
for he that has had no tryal of himself in that nature, ought not to presume barely upon
his courage; nor can he promise himself any certain success, by reason that the terror and
perturbation of his mind is many times so strong, that it makes his Weapon fall out of his
hand, or words fall from his Mouth, which discover the whole Plot. Lucilla the Sister
of Commodus, ordered Quintianus to kill her Brother: Quintianus waited for Commodus
as he came into the Amphitheater, and meeting him when he came, he ran at him with
his naked Sword, crying aloud, Questo ti mando il Senato, The Senate sends you this;
but those words gave an alarm, and he was seized before he could lift up his arm to give
the blow. Messer Antonio da Volterra, deputed (as is said before) to kill Lorenzo de Me|dici,
when he advanced to assault him, cryed out, Ah Traytor! but that exclamation was
the preservation of Lorenzo, and the ruine of the Conspirators. But these Enterprizes are
difficult, when directed only against one person, for the reasons abovesaid, yet when they
are bent against two, they are much more, because in several places it is impossible any de|sign
should be well executed at once; so that to conspire against a Prince in that way, is a
doubtful, dangerous and imprudent thing. Were it not for the reverence I bear to the
Author, I should scarce believe what Herodian says of Plautianus, that he committed to
one single Centurion called Saturninus, the killing of Severus and Antoninus who lived
in several places; for 'tis so irrational a thing, that nothing but his Authority could have
persuaded me to it. Certain young Gentlemen of Athens conspired against Diocles and
Hippias, two Tyrants in that City. They killed Diocles, but Hippias escaped, and re|venged
his death. Chiones and Leonides of Heraclea, two of Plato's Disciples, conspired
against Clearchus and Satirus, two Tyrants of that place; Clearchus was murthered, but
Satirus survived and revenged it. The Pazzi (whom we have so often mentioned) kil|led
only Iulian de Medici, his brother escaping; so that from these Conspiracies against
several persons, all wise people will abstain, as things that are fatal to themselves, their
Country, and every body else; for those who escape are thereby render'd the more cruel
and Tyrannical, as appears by the aforesaid examples in Florence, Athens, and Heraclea.
And therefore the Conspiracy of Pelopidas against the Tyrants of Thebes was admirable,
in respect of the success, seeing not only one, but ten of them were to be murthered; and
that he was neither a favourite, nor had easie access to them; but was a Rebel, and in
banishment; yet he overcame all these difficulties, got into Thebes, killed the Tyrants, and
delivered his Country; but with the assistance of Caron one of the Tyrants great Counsel|lors
who gave him admission, and contributed much to his success. But let no man pre|sume
upon this example, for it is looked upon not only as a rare thing, but as a miracle.
The execution of such a design may be interruped likewise by a false imagination, or
some unexpected accident happening in the very act. The very morning that Brutus and
his Confederates were to murther Caesar, it hapned that he had a long discourse with Cn.
Popilius Lenas one of the Conspirators, which the rest of the accomplices observing, con|cluded
that Popilius had discovered all to Caesar, and was giving him an account; where|upon
it was proposed to kill Caesar presently, and not to defer it till he was in the Senate;
and doubtless they had done it, but that their discourse broke off; and Caesar went away
without any Commotion. These imaginations are sometimes very considerable, and to be
regarded with a great deal of prudence, and the rather, because they are easily taken up;
for he who is conscious to himself, is always apt to suspect that they are talking of him;
and it may so fall out, that a word spoken to another intent, may gaul and disturb you as
much as if it were spoken on purpose, and either force you to fly, or so hasten and preci|pitate
the execution, that you run your self upon many inconveniences, especially where
many are privy to the Plot. As to the accidents, because they are unexpected and occa|sional,
no directions can be given against them, but examples by which men are to regu|late
and be cautious. Iulius Belanti of Siena (whom we have mentioned before) being
incensed against Pandolfus, who had given him his Daughter in Marriage, and taken her
from him again, conspired his death, and laid his design thus, Pandolfus went almost eve|ry
day to visit one of his Relations that was sick; and in his passage went commonly by
Iulius his house: upon this consideration, Iulius got all his accomplices together into
his house, with intention to assault him as he went by; to which purpose he armed them
all, and disposed them into the Porch, that they might be ready upon a signal to be given
from a Window above: It hapned that Pandolfus being just by, the person at the Win|dow
gave the signal, when by accident in the very nick of time Pandolfus met a friend,
and stopt to salute him: Some of his Attendants passing on, heard a noise of Arms, took
the Alarm, and discovered the Ambuscade; so that Pandolfus was miraculously preserved,
Iulio and his Companions forced to fly from Siena, and all by the accident of this ren|counter,

which not only hindred the execution at that time, but defeated the whole enter|prize.
But against these accidents no remedy can be prescribed, because they happen so rarely;
however it is necessary to think of us many, and provide against them as well as we can.
It remains now that we say something of those dangers which we incur after execution is
done; of which sort there is but one, and that is, when somebody is left alive that may re|venge
it: as his children, brothers, kinsmen, and such others to whom the sovereignty
may descend by right of inheritance, and these may be left to revenge the death of their
Predecessor, either by your negligence, or by some of the accidents aforesaid, as it hapned
to Giovan-Andrea da Lampognano, who conspiring with other persons, killed the Duke of
Milan, but they left two of his Brothers and one of his Sons behind, who revenged it in
due time. But in these cases the Conspirators are to be excused, because there is no re|medy
to be provided; but where by their own imprudence or negligence they suffer any
such to escape, there it is otherwise, and they are highly to be condemned. At Forum
Livii some there were who conspired against Count Girolamo, lew him, seized upon his
wife and children, (which were very young) and clap'd them in Prison: a great mind
they had to the Castle, but the Governour was refractory, and would not admit them;
the Counsels (called Madonna Caterin) made them a proposition, that if they would suf|fer
her to go into him, she would prevail with the Governor to surrender, and that in the
mean time her children should be left as hostages in their hands. The Conspirators be|lieved
her, and let her go in, but she was no sooner in the Castle, but she began to upbraid
them by the death of her Husband, and threaten them with all possible revenge; and to
convince them that her care and compassion for her children should not restrain her, she
shew'd them her genitals thorow the windows, to let them know, that if they killed those,
she had wherewithal to have more: so that perceiving their error too late, and being desti|tute
of all counsel, their indiscretion was punished with their perpetual banishment. But
of all dangers after the fact is committed, none is so fatal as the affection of the people to
their Prince whom you have slain. For their revenge is not possible to be prevented. Of
this, the murder of Caesar may be an example: for the people of Rome being his friends,
his death was thorowly revenged upon the Conspirators, who afterwards (though in seve|ral
times and places) were all of them slain. Conjurations against ones Country are not
so dangerous as Conjurations against ones Prince; for in the contrivance and management
the dangers are not so many; in the execution they are but the same; and after the fact
is committed, they are nothing at all. In the management and preparation the dangers
are not so many, because a Citizen may make his party, and put his affairs in a posture with|out
discover  is orders be not interrupted, bring his designs to a very good end;
or if they be inerrupted by some Law, it is in his power to adjourn the execution, or find
out some other way that may be more commodious; but all these (it is to be understood)
are to be done only in Commonwealths, where the manners of the people are beginning
to be corrupted; because where the City is incorrupt, such designs will never come into
any of their thoughts; but in a corrupt Republick where the dangers are not so great, there
are many ways for private Citizens to make themselves Princes; because a Commonwealth
is not so quick and dexterous as a Prince, their suspicion is less, and by consequence their
caution: besides, they are commonly in more awe of their Grandees, and therefore the
Grandees are more bold and couragious against them. Every body has read Catilins's
Conspiracy written by Salust, and can tell how Catiline (after it was detected) not only
continued in Rome, but came audaciously into the Senate, and had the confidence to talk
insolently both to the Senate and Consul; so great reverence had that City, for its Citi|zens.
And when things were gone so far, that he had left the City, and was got to the
head of an Army, Lentulus, and the rest of the Conspirators had never been seized, had
not there been Letters produced against them under their own hands.
Hanno a great Citizen in Carthage had a mind to usurp; and in order thereto;
he had contrived at the Wedding of one of his Daughters to poison the whole
Senate, and then make himself Prince: when his plot was discovered, the Senate
troubled themselves with no farther provision against it, than by making a Law against
exorbitant feasting upon such kind of occasions, so great was their respect to a Citizen of
his quality! But in a Conspiracy against ones Country, the greatest danger lies in the exe|cution;
for it seldom happens that a particular Citizen is strong enough to subdue a whole
Country; and every man is not General of an Army, as Caesar, Agathocles, Cleomenes and
others were, who had their Armies ready to back their designs. To such the way is easie
and secure; but they who want those advantages must manage their business with more
cunning, or employ foreign assistance: this cunning and artifice was used by Pisistrates the

Athenian; for having overcome the Megarenses, and thereby got himself great reputa|tion
among the people, he came forth of his house one morning, and shew'd himself woun|ded
to them, complaining that the Nobility had abused him, and desiring that he might be
permitted to have a guard for the security of his person; which being granted inconsi|derately,
gave him opportunity by degrees to make himself absolute. Pandolfus Petrucci
(with other Exiles) returned to Siena; and by way of contempt was made Keeper of the
Palace, which was a mechanick employment that others had refused. Yet those few arm'd
men who were under his Command by virtue of that place, by degres gave him such re|putation,
that at length he made himself Prince. Others have taken other ways, and by
time, and their industry, arrived at the same dignity without any danger: but those who
have endeavoured to make themselves Masters of their Country by their own force, or
foreign supplies; have had various events, as fortune was pleased to befriend them! Cata|line
was ruined: Hanno (of whom we have spoken before) failing in his poison, arm'd
many thousands of his Partisans, which were all slain with him. Certain of the principal
Citizens of Thebes, by the help of a Spartan Army, made themselves Masters of that City,
and tyranniz'd over it: so that if all conspiracies against their Country be examined,
there will none, or but very few be found to have miscarried in the management; but the
whole stress of their good or bad fortune has layn upon the execution, which being once
pass'd, they are subject to no more dangers than what depend upon the nature of the Go|vernment;
for when a man usurps, and makes himself a Tyrant, he exposes himself to
those natural and inseparable dangers which are the consequences of Tyranny, against
which he has no other remedies than what have been described before.
This is what I have thought convenient to write upon the subject of Conspiracies; and
if I have discoursed only of those which are executed by the sword, and not by poison, it
is because they have the same orders and methods. True it is, the way of poison is the
most dangerous, as being the more uncertain, because every one has not convenience, but is
forc'd to confer with other people, and the necessity of that Conference is much to be
feared: besides, many things happen which makes your potion ineffectual, as it fell out to
those who killed Commodus; who having disgorg'd his poison, forc'd the Conspirators to
strangle him. Princes then have no Enemy to which they are more dangerously exposed,
than to these Conspiracies, because they are never undertaken against any of them, but they
take away his life, or reputation. If they succeed, he dies; if they miscarry, and the in|struments
be put to death, it is look'd upon as a pretence and invention of the Prince to
satiate his avarice or cruelty upon the blood or fortunes of his enemies. My advice there|fore
is (both to Prince and Commonwealth, that upon the discovery of a Conspiracy,
(before they think of revenge) seriously to consider the quality of it, and to compare the
condition of the Conspirators with their own: if they find them potent and strong, till
they have furnished themselves with a proportionable force, no notice is to be taken; if
notice be taken, they are unable to defend themselves, and certainly ruined; for the Con|spirators
finding themselves discovered, will grow desperate, and be under a necessity of ven|turing,
let the success be what it will. The Romans may be an example of this way of
dissembling; for having (as we said before) left two of their Legions at Capua for the se|curity
of that City against the Samnites; the Commanders of the said Legions conspir'd
to make themselves Masters of the Town. The Romans having notice of their designs,
committed the prevention of it to Rutilius their new Consul, who to lull and delude the
Conspirators, gave out that the Senate had confirmed that Station to those Legions for
another winter, which the Legions believed, and thinking then they should have time
enough, they neglected to hasten their design, till at length observing the Consul to draw
them away insensibly, and dispose them into other parts, they began to suspect, and that
suspicion made them discover themselves, and put their plot in execution. Nor can an
example be brought more properly for either sides; for by it we may see how cool and re|miss
people are when they think they have time enough; and how sudden and vigorous
when necessity presses them. And the Prince or Commonwealth which would defer the
discovery of a Plot, cannot do it with more advantage to himself, than by giving the Con|spirators
some handsom occasion to believe that they may execute it with more ease and
security another time; for thereby the Prince or Commonwealth will have more leisure
to provide for their defence: they who have proceeded otherwise, have but hastened their
own ruine, as we have seen in the case of the Duke of Athens, and Gulielmo de Pazzi.
The Duke having made himself Sovereign in Florence, and understanding there were
Conspiracies against him; without enquiring farther into the business, caused one of them
to be apprehended, which giving an alarm to the rest, they immediately took arms, and
turn'd the Duke out of his Supremacy. Gulielmo being Commissary for that City in the

Val di Chiana in the year 1501, having news of a great Plot in Arezzo in favour of the
Vitelli, and that their design was to renounce the dominion of the Florentines, he marched
thither directly, without considering the power of the Conspirators, or his own, or so
much as furnishing himself with what Forces he might have done; and by the advice of
the Bishop his Son, causing one of the Conspirators to be seized, the rest fell presently to
their arms, disclaim'd the Florentines, and took their Commissary prisoner. But when
Conspiracies are weak, and in their infancy, if they be discovered, they are to suppress them
out of hand, without any suspence, and not to follow the example either of the Duke of
Athens, or Dion of Syracuse, of whom the first caused a Citizen who had discovered a
plot to him, to be put to death, that the rest observing how unwilling he was to believe
any thing of them, might be the more secure, and hold themselves obliged. Dion on the
other side suspecting the affections of some people, caused one of his Confidents called
Calippus to pretend a Conspiracy, and see if he could draw them in; but both these practi|ces
succeeded very ill, for by the first, all people were discouraged from making any disco|very,
and all Conspirators confirmed; and by the other, a way was recommended for the
murdering of himself; for Calippus finding he had an opportunity to practice without
danger, he did it so effectually, that it cost Dion both his Government and Life.


CHAP. VII.
How it comes to pass that in the changes of State, from liberty to servitude,
and from servitude to liberty, some are very innocent, and others very
bloody.
SOme people perhaps may wonder how it should come to pass that Governments should
be changed from one form to another, sometimes easily, and without blood, and some|times
with great difficulty and slaughter, be the variation as it will, either from liberty to
tyranny, or from tyranny to liberty. And this diversity of mutations is so strange, that
as History tells us, they happen sometimes with infinite effusion of blood, and at other times
without the least injury to any body: as in Rome, when the Government was taken from
the Kings, and put into the hands of the Consul, no body was expulsed, or so much as
molested but the Tarquins; but in other alterations it has been otherwise, and the cause of
this diversity may (in my judgment) be deduced from the manner in which that State was
acquired; if it was obtained by force, it could not be without injury to many people, and then
when ever it is destroyed, it will necessarily follow that all those who were injured before,
will endeavour to repair and revenge themselves; which is not to be done without great
tumult and slaughter. But when a Commonwealth is fix'd gradually, and by universal
consent of the people, when it comes to be changed, there is no need of disturbing any
body lse; for the bare removal of those who are then in authority, will effectually do the
business. Of this sort was the revolution at Rome upon the translation of the Govern|ment
from the Kings to the Consuls; and the accident at Florence in the year 1494, when
the Medici were expelled without the least prejudice to any body else; for they having been
advanced by the general vote of the people, there was no need of doing more than turning
them out of the City. Such mutations are not therefore so dangerous; but those others
where many have been injured, and as many are to be revenged, have been so dreadfully
destructive, that the very History of their consequences is enough to terrifie the Reader;
but all Books being full of them, I shall speak no more of them in this place.



CHAP. VIII.
He who would change the form of a Government, is to consider seriously up|on
what grounds he does it, and the disposition of the Subject.
IT has been said before, that an evil disposed Citizen can do no great hurt but in an ill
disposed City, which conclusion (besides my former arguments) is much fortfied by the
examples of Sprius Cassius, and Manlius Capitolinus; Spurius was an ambitious man,
and being desirous to procure to himself extraordinary authority in Rome, by favouring
the people in the sale of such Lands as the Romans had conquered from the Hernici, the
Senate discovered it, and grew so jealous of him, that when in a speech of his to the people
he proffered to give them the mony which had been received for corn that the Senate had
sent for out of Sicily, the people absolutely refused it; supposing that Spurius intended
that their liberty should make it good: but had the people of Rome at that time been corrupt,
or ill disposed, they had taken his mony, and opened him a way to the making him|self
absolute; but the example of Manlius Capitolinus is greater than this, for by that we
may see how the courage and integrity which he expressed to his Country in their wars
against the Gauls, was afterwards clowded and extinguished by an infatiable desire of
authority arising from an emulation of Camillus, whom the Romans had advanced to a
greater degree of honour; and so strangely was he blinded with this passion, that not con|sidering
the state and incorruption of the City, or how indisposed the people were to any
such enterprize, he began to make parties, and raise tumults in Rome both against the Senate
and Laws. In which passage it was evident how well that Government was constituted,
and how well that people was disposed; for in this case (though the Nobility and he were
great friends, and fierce defenders of one anothers interest) none of them, nor his very re|lations
appeared in his behalf; and whereas at other Trials the friends of the criminal used
to accompany him to the Bar in mourning, and with all other circumstances of sadness that
they  of, to work (if it were possible) the Judges to compassion; Manlius went
alone, without so much as one friend to attend him: the Tribunes of the people who
were in other things always opposite to the Nobility, and created on purpose to balance
their power; when they found the design tending to the ruine of them all, they joyn'd
heartily with them to remove so commo a destruction: and the people of Rome, who
were zealous in any thing that made for their advantage, and lovers of any thing that
crossed the Nobility, (though they also had their kindness for Manlius;) nevertheless when
the Tribunes cited him, and referred him to the judgment of the people, they condemned
him to death, without any consideration of his former services. Wherefore I am of opi|nion,
that in the whole tract of this History there is not an example that with more efficacy
demonstrates the justice of that Commonwealth in all its orders and degrees of men than
this; seeing there was not one Citizen appeared in the defence of Manlius, who was a
person of known virtue and endowments, and had done many honourable things both in
publick and private, and the reason was, because the love to their Country had a greater in|fluence
upon them than any other respect; and the consideration of the present danger of
their affairs, being stronger than the memory of his past merits, they chose to free them|selves
by decreeing his death. Titus Livius, tells us, Hunc exitum habuit vir nisi in libera
Civitatenatusesset, memorabilis; This was the end of a man who had been very memorable,
had he been born any where but in a free State. And in his case there are two things very
remarkable; one, that in a corrupt State glory and authority is acquir'd a quite contrary
way, than where they live exactly according to the true rules of policy and justice; the
other, (not much unlike the former) that men in their affairs, especially of greatest impor|tance,
are to consider the times, and accommodate thereunto; and those who by the un|happiness
of their election, or their natural inclination do otherwise, live always unfor|tunately,
and are more unsuccessful in all their enterprizes than they who comply with the
times. And doubtless, by the fore-mentioned expression of the Historian, had Manlius
been born in the days of Marius and Sylla, when the Mass was corrupt and depraved, and
susceptible of any form his ambition would have imprinted, he had had the same success that
they had when they aspired to be absolute. So again, had Marius and Sylla come into the
World in the time of Manlius, they had miscarried as he did, and been lost in their first
attempt. For one man by his ill customs and conversation may indeed give a touch and
tincture of corruption to the people, but 'tis impossible his life should be long enough to
debauch them so totally that he may expect any advantage of it in his time; or if he

should be so happy, and live long enough to infect a whole City; yet so impatient are the
desires of man, that they cannot restrain their passions, or attend an opportunity of pur|suing
them wisely, but they circumvent and delude themselves in those very things of
which they are most eagerly ambitious; so that sometimes for want of patience, and
sometimes for want of judgment they venture rashly upon things before the matter be pre|pared,
and are ruined in their designs. He therefore who would alter a Government and
set up himself, must attend till time has corrupted the Mass, and by degrees brought all into
disorder, which of necessity must follow, when it is not (as we said before) purged and
refined by the Examples of good Men or good Laws, that may reduce it towards its first
principles. Manlius then had been a great and memorable person, had he been born in a
corrupt City; for whoever designs any innovation in a State, whether it be for the restitution
of liberty, or the erection of Tyranny, is particularly to regard the manners of the peo|ple,
and to consider how far they are disposed to submit to his ambition; and by so doing
he may be able to judge of the success of his Enterprize. For to endeavour to make a
people free, that are servile in their Nature, is as hard a matter, as to keep them in servi|tude,
who are disposed to be free. And because we have said before, That in all their
operations men are to consider and proceed according to the quality of the times, we shall
speak of it at large in the following Chapter.


CHAP. IX.
How he that would succeed, must accommodate to the times.
I Have many times considered with my self that the occasion of every mans good or
bad fortune consists in his correspondence and accommodation with the times. We
see some people acting furiously, and with an impetus; others with more slowness and
caution; and because both in the one and the other they are immoderate, and do not ob|serve
their just terms, therefore both of them do err; but their error and misfortune is
least, whose customs suit and correspond with the times; and who comports himself in his
designs according to the impulse of his own Nature. Every one can tell how Fabius Maxi|mus
conducted his Army, and with what carefulness and caution he proceeded, contrary to
the ancient heat and boldness of the Romans, and it hapned that grave way was more
conformable to those times; for Hanibal coming young and brisk into Italy, and being
elated with his good fortune, as having twice defeated the Armies of the Romans, that
Commonwealth having lost most of her best Soldiers, and remaining in great fear and
confusion, nothing could have happen'd more seasonably to them, than to have such a
General who by his caution and cunctation could keep the Enemy at a Bay. Nor could
any times have been more fortunate to his way of proceeding; for that that slow and
deliberate way was natural in Fabius, and not affected, appeared afterwards when Scipio
being desirous to pass his Army into Africk to give the finishing blow to the War, Fabius
opposed it most earnestly, as one who could not force or dissemble, his Nature, which was
rather to support wisely against the difficulties that were upon him, than to search out for
new. So that had Fabius directed, Hanibal had continued in Italy, and the reason was
because he did not consider the times were altered, and the method of the War was to be
changed with them: And if Fabius at that time had been King of Rome, he might well
have been worsted in the War, as not knowing how to frame his Counsels according to the
variation of the times. But there being in that Commonwealth so many brave men, and
excellent Commanders of all sorts of tempers and humours, fortune would have it, That
as Fabius was ready in hard and difficult times, to sustain the Enemy, and continue the
War; so afterwards when affairs were in a better posture, Scipio was presented to finish
and conclude it. And hence it is, that an Aristocracy or free State is longer lived, and
generally more fortunate, than a Principality, because in the first they are more flexible, and
can frame themselves better to the diversity of the times: For a Prince being accustomed to
one way, is hardly to be got out of it, though perhaps the variation of the times require
it very much. Piero Soderini (whom I have mentioned before) proceeded with great
gentleness and humanity in all his actions; and he and his Country prospered whilst the
times were according; but when the times changed, and there was a necessity of laying
aside that meekness and humility, Pi was at a loss, and he and his Country were both
ruined.

Pope Iulius XI. during the whole time of his Papacy carried himself with great vigour
and vehemence; and because the times were agreeable, he prospered in every thing; but
had the times altered, and required other Counsels, he had certainly been ruined, because
he could never have complyed. And the reason why we cannot change so easily with the
times, is twofold; first, because we cannot readily oppose our selves against what we natu|rally
desire; and next, because when we have often tryed one way, and have always been
prosperous, we can never persuade our selves that we can do so well any other; and this
is the true cause why a Princes fortune varies so strangely, because she varies the times, but
he does not alter the way of his administrations. And it is the same in a Commonwealth,
if the variation of the times be not observed, and their Laws and Customs altered accor|dingly,
many mischiefs must follow, and the Government be ruined, as we have largely
demonstrated before; but those alterations of their Laws are more slow in a Common|wealth,
because they are not so easily changed, and there is a necessity of such times as
may shake the whole State, to which one man will not be sufficient, let him change his
proceedings, and take new measures as he pleases. But because we have mentioned Fa|bius
Maximus, and how he kept Hanibal at a Bay, I think it not amiss to enquire in the
next Chapter whether a General who is resolved upon any terms to engage, can be obstru|cted
by the Enemy.


CHAP. X.
A General cannot avoid fighting, when the Enemy is resolved to
Engage him upon any terms.
CNeus Sulpitius Dictator (says Livy) adversus Gallos bellum trahebat, nolens se fortunae
committere adversus hostem, quem tempus deteriorem indies,  locus alienus, faceret.
Cneus Sulpitius the Dictator declined fighting with the French, because he would not expose
himself unnecessarily against an Enemy, who by the incommodity of the season, and inconve|nience
of his Station was every day in danger to be undone.
When such a fault happens as deceives all, or the greatest part of Mankind, I think it
not improper to reprehend it over and over again; and therefore though I have formerly
in several places shown how much our actions in great things, are different from those in
ancient times; yet I think it not superfluous to say something of it here.
If in any thing we deviate from the practice of the Ancients, it is in our Military Disci|pline,
in which we are so absolutely new, that there is scarce any thing used that was
preferred by our Ancestors; and the reason is, because Commonwealths and Princes,
being unwilling to expose themselves to danger, have shifted off that study and charge
upon other people: And when in our times any Prince goes in person into the field, no
extraordinary matter is to be expected, for he takes the command upon him to show his
grandeur and magnificence, more than for any thing else. Yet they commit fewer faults
(by reviewing their Armies sometimes, and keeping that command in their own hands)
than Republicks are wont to do, especially in Italy, where trusting all to other people,
they understand nothing of War themselves; and on the other side, in their Counsels and
determinations (which to show their superiority they reserve to themselves) they commit
a thousand times more errors than in the field, some of which I have mentioned elsewhere,
but I shall speak here of one of them, and that of more than ordinary importance, when
these unactive Princes, or effeminate Commonwealths send out an Army, the wisest thing
which they think they can give in command to their General, is to enjoyn him from fight|ing,
and above all things to have a care of a Battel, supposing that therein they imitate
the wisdom of Fabius Maximus, who preserved the State, by deferring the combat; but
they are mistaken, and do not consider that most commonly that injunction is either idle,
or dangerous; for this is most certain, a General who desires to keep the Field, cannot avoid
fight when the Enemy presses, and makes it his business to engage him. So that to
command a General in that Nature, in as much as to bid him fight when the Enemy
pleases, and not when he sees occasion himself. For to keep the field, and avoid fighting,
is to be done no way so securely as by keeping 50 miles off, and sending out store of Spies
and Scouts that may give you notice of the Enemies approach, and opportunity to retreat.
There is another way likewise to secure your self, ad that is to shut your self up in some
strong Town, but both the one and the other are dangerous. In the first case, The Coun|try
is exposed to the depredations of the Enemy, and a generous Prince will sooner run

the hazard of a Battel, than spin out a War with so much detriment to his Subjects. In
the second, your ruine is evident; for cooping up your Army in a City, the Enemy will
block you up, or besiege you, and then the multitude of your men will quickly bring a
scarcity of provisions, and supplies being cut off, you will be forced to surrender; so that
to avoid fighting either of these two ways, is very pernicious. Fabius his way of standing
upon his guard, and keeping his Army in places of advantage is laudable and good, when
your Army is so strong, that the Enemy dares not attack you: Nor can it be said that Fa|bius
declined fighting, but that he deferred till he could do it with advantage; for had
Hanibal advanced against him, Fabius would have kept his ground and engaged him, but
Hanibal was too cunning for that; so that Hanibal as well as Fabius avoided fighting; but
if either of them would have fought upon disadvantage the other had only three remedies;
that is, the two foresaid, and flying. That this which I say is true, is manifest by a thousand
examples, but more particularly by the War which the Romans made upon Philip of Mace|don;
Philip being invaded by the Romans, resolved not to come to a Battel; and to avoid
it, he (as Fabius did in Italy) encamped his Army upon the top of a Mountain, and en|trenched
himself so strongly, that he believed the Romans durst not have ventured to come
at him: But they not only adventured, but removed him from the Mountain, forced him
to fly with the greatest part of his Army, and had it not been for the unpassableness of the
Country which hindered the pursuit, the Macedonians had all been cut off. Philip, then,
being unwilling to fight, and having (as I said before) encamped upon the Mountains not
far from the Romans, durst not trust himself to his advantages; and having found by ex|perience
that he was not secure there, he would not pin himself up in a Town, but made
choice of the other way, and kept himself at a distance; so as when the Romans came into
one Province, he would remove into another, and what place soever the Romans left, he
would be sure to come to: At length finding this protraction of the War, made his af|fairs
but worse, and that his Subjects were harrassed by both Armies, he resolved to try
his fortune, and bring all to the decision of a Battel: But it is convenient to avoid fighting
when your Army is in the same condition as those of Fabius, and Sulpitius; that is, when
it is so considerable that the Enemy fears to attack you in your entrenchments; and though
he has got some footing in your Country, yet not so much as is able to supply him with
provisions; in this case 'tis best to decline fighting, and follow the example of Sulpitius,
Nolens se fortunae committere, c. But in all other cases it is not to be done, but with
dishonour and danger; for to fly (as Philip did) is as bad as to be routed, and more
dishonorable, because he gave no proof of his courage, and though he escaped by the diffi|culty
of the Country; yet whoever follows his example without that convenience, may
chance to be ruin'd. No man will deny but Hanibal was a great Soldier, and of more
than ordinary experience; when he went into Africa against Scipio, if he had seen it for
his advantage to have protracted the War, he would have done it, and perchance (being a
great Captain, and having as good an Army) he would have done it the same way as
Fabius did in Italy; but seeing he did not do it, it is probable he was diverted by some
extraordinary occasion. For that Prince who has got an Army together, (if he perceives
that for want of pay, or supplies, he is not likely to keep them long) is stark mad if he
tries not his fortune before his Army disbands, for by delaying, he is certainly lost; by
fighting he may possibly overcome: And above all things, whether we are victorious or
beaten, we are to behave ourselves honourably, and 'tis more honourable to be overcome
by force, than by some error to run your self into incommodities that ruine you after|wards.
'Tis not unlikely but Hanibal might be impelled by some such necessity; and on
the other side Scipio (if Hanibal should have deferred fighting) might have chose whe|ther
he would have attacked him in his Trenches, because he had already conquered
Syphax, and got such footing in Africk, that he was as safe, and with as much commodity
as in Italy; but it was otherwise with Hanibal when he had to do with Fabius; and with
the French when they had to do with Sulpitius. And he who invades an Enemies Coun|try,
avoids fighting with more difficulty, as being obliged (when ever the Enemy appears
to obstruct him) to give him Battel; and if he sets down before any Town, he is obliged
so much the more, as in our times it happen'd to Charles Duke of Burgundy, who was
beaten up in his Leaguer before Morat by the Swizzers, and defeated. And the same
thing fell out to the French at the Seige of Novarra, where they were attacht and beaten
by the Swizzers.



CHAP. XI.
One person that has many Enemies upon his hands, though he be inferiour
to them, yet if he can sustain their first impression, carries commonly the
Victory.
THe power of the Tribunes of the people was great and necessary in the City of
Rome to correct the ambition of the Nobility, who otherwise would have debauch'd
the said City much sooner than they did: But as it happens in other things, so it happened
in this; in the best and most beneficial thing to the Commonwealth, there was an occult,
and remote evil that lay snug, which required new Laws, and new methods to suppress.
For the insolence of the Tribunitial authority grew so great, that it became terrible both
to the Senate and people, and had doubtlesly produced some great mischief to the Com|monwealth,
had not Appius Claudius by his great wisdom, found out a way to temper
and ballance their fury, by the intercession of their Colleagues, and the way was by choo|sing
out some person among the Tribunes, whom either out of fear, or corruption, or
love to his Country they could dispose to withstand the designs of his Brethren, and oppose
himself against them, whenever their resolutions were tending to the diminution of the
Nobility, or prejudice of the State. Which way of restraining the petulancy of the
Tribunes was for a long time of great advantage to the Romans, and may give us occasion
to consider, whether a combination of several great persons, against one less powerful
than they (whilst united) is like to be successful against him that is alone; or whether
the single person has the advantage against the Confederacy. I answer, That those whose
Forces are united, are many times stronger, but their performances are seldom so great, as
the single persons, though he be nothing so strong, for committing an infinite number of
other things (in which the single person has the advantage) he will be able with a little
industry to break, and divide and enfeeble them: To this purpose there is no need of go|ing
to antiquity for examples (where there is plenty enough) the passages of our own
times will furnish us sufficiently. In the year 1484, all Italy confederated against the Ve|netian,
who, when they were so over-powr'd and distress'd that they were unable to keep
the field, found a way to work off Count Lodavic (Governor of Milan) from their
League, by which means they not only obtained a Peace, and restitution of what they
had lost; but they got a good part of the Dutchy of Ferrara; so that they whose Forces
were too weak to appear before the Enemy; when they came to treat, were the greatest
gainers by the War. Not many years since, the whole Christian world seemed to conspire
against France; yet before the end of the War, the Spaniard fell off from the League,
made his Peace with the French, and forced the rest of the Confederates, one after one, to
do the same. And from hence we may easily collect that as often as many Princes or
States are confederated together against any single Prince or Commonwealth, if the single
Prince and Commonwealth be strong enough to withstand their first impression, and spin
out the War, he will certainly prevail; but if his force be not sufficient to do that, he is
in extraordinary danger, as it happen'd to the Venetians; for had they been able to have
sustained their first shock, and protracted the War, till they had debauched some of the
Confederates, the French had never done them so much mischief, and they had preserv'd
themselves from ruine: But their Army being too weak to confront them, and their time
too little to divide them, they were undone; and this is evident by what happen'd after|ward;
for as soon as the Pope had recovered what he had lost, he reconciled himself, and
became their friend; the Spaniard did the same, and both of them would have been glad
to have continued Lombardy to the Venetians, rather than the French should have got it,
and made himself so considerable in Italy. The Venetians at that time might have pre|vented
a great part of their calamities, had they given some small part of their Territory
to the Enemy, and thereby have secured the rest; but then they must have given it in time,
and so as it might not have appeared to have been done by necessity, as they might well
have done before the War was commenced; when that was begun, it would have been
dishonourable, and perhaps ineffectual. But before those troubles, there were few of the
Venetian Citizens that could foresee a danger; fewer that could remedy it; and none at all
that could advise. To conclude therefore this Chapter, I do pronounce, that as the Ro|man
remedy against the ambition of their Tribunes, was the multitude of them, out of
which they always found some or other, that they could make for the interest of the Publick;
so it is a ready remedy for any Prince that is engaged against a confederate Enemy, when he
can break their League, and work any of the Confederates to a separation.



CHAP. XII.
A wise General is to put a necessity of fighting upon his own Army, but to pre|vent
it to his Enemies.
WE have formerly discoursed of what use and importance necessity is in humane
Exploits, and shown how many men, compelled by necessity, have done glo|rious
things, and made their memories immortal. Moral Philosophers have told us, That
the Tongue, and the Hands are noble Instruments of themselves; yet they had never brought
things to that exactness and perfection, had not necessity impelled them. The Generals
therefore of old, understanding well the virtue of this necessity; and how much more
desperate and obstinate their Soldiers were rendered thereby, made it their care to bring
their Soldiers into a necessity of fighting, and to keep it from their Enemies; to which
end, they many times opened a passage for the Enemies Army, which they might easily
have obstructed; and precluded it to their own, when they might as easily have passed.
Whoever therefore, desires to make his Garrison stout and couragious, and obstinate for
the defence of a Town, or to render his Army pertinacious in the Field, is above all
things to reduce them into such a necessity, or at least to make them believe it: So that
a wise General, who designs the besieging of a Town, judges of the easiness or difficulty
of the expugnation, from the necessity which lies upon the Citizens to defend themselves:
If the necessity of their defence be great, his enterprize is the more difficult, because the
courage and obstinacy of the besieged is like to be the greater; but where there is no such
necessity, there is no such danger. Hence it is that revolted Towns are much harder to be
recovered, than they were to be taken at first; for at first having committed no fault,
they were in fear of no punishment, and therefore surrendered more easily: But in the
other case having the guilt of their defect up their Spirits, they are fearful of revenge,
and so become more obstinate in their defence. These are not unusual, and yet there are
other causes which render the minds of people obstinate in their defence, and one of them
is the natural hatred and animosity which is frequently betwixt neighbouring Princes and
States, which proceeds from an infatiable desire of Dominion in Princes, and as zealous an
inclination to liberty in Commonwealths, especially if they be constituted as in Tuscany,
where that emulation and jealousie has made them refractory both on the one side, and the
other. Hence it is, though that the Florentines have been at greater charges than the Veneti|ans,
yet their acquests are not so much, because the Towns in Tuscany were most of them
free,  by consequence more difficult to be brought to subjection; whereas the Towns which
the Venetians conquered, having been most of them under Princes, and accustomed to
servitude, it was indifferent to them under whose dominion they were; and they are so
far from resisting a change, that they do many times desire it. So that though the Cities
upon the Frontiers of the Venetian, were generally stronger, than those upon the Frontiers
of the Florentine, yet they were reduced with more ease; because being not so free, they
were less obstinate in their defence: when therefore, a wise General resolves upon a Siege,
he is with all diligence to take away that necessity from the Citizens which may make them
inflexible, either by promising indemnity, if they have deserved to be punished; or if it
be only their liberty of which they are fearful, by assuring them that his designs are not
against that, but only against the ambition and exorbitancy of some particular persons;
which kind of promises had strange effects in the facilitating of Enterprizes, and the
taking of Towns; for though wise men will easily discover the fraud, yet the multitude
are commonly so impatient of War, and so mad to be at quiet, that they shut their Eyes a|gainst
any thing of mischief that comes to them under propositions of peace; by which
means many Cities have lost their liberty, as it happened to Florence not long since; and
to M. Crassus and his Army heretofore, who though he was sensible that the promises of
the Parthians were fraudulent, and made only to keep his Soldiers from that necessity of
defending themselves, yet he could not convince them, nor prevail with them to stand
bravely upon their Guard, but being blinded with their overtures of Peace, both Army and
General were cut off, as may be seen by the History. The Samnites, put on by the am|bition
of some of their Citizens, brake their Peace with the Romans, and invaded their
Country; but being afterwards sensible of what they had done, they sent Embassadors
to Rome offering restitution of what they had taken, and to deliver up the Authors of
that Counsel into their hands, o be punished as they pleas'd; but being rejected, and
their Embassadors sent home without any hopes of agreement, Pontius their General used

it as an argument to encourage his men to fight more obstinately, that the Romans having
refused their fair overtures of Peace, were resolved upon War; and therefore there was no
other course, but of necessity they must fight. And (says he) Iustum est bellum, quibus
est necessarium  pia arma, quibus nulla nisi in armis spes est. That Wur is just that is ne|cessary,
and Arms are piously taken up by him, who has no other hopes to secure himself. Upon
which necessity he founded the hopes of his Victory. C. Manlius was at the head of an
Army against the Vejentes, and part of the Army of the Vejentes being got into his Camp
Manlius to cut of their retreat, doubled his Guards at the gates, and fortified all the Passes
by which they were to return; but the Vejentes perceiving they were desperate, fought
with so much courage and fury, that they killed the Consul, and had cut off his whole
Army, had not one of the Tribunes very wisely opened them a way to be gone: In which
action we may observe that whilst the Vejentes were under a necessity of fighting, there was
no resisting of their courage; but when a way was opened for their retreat, they chose
rather to fly. The Volsci and the Equi were entered upon the confines of the Romans, who
sent their Consuls against them with an Army: and coming to a Battel, it happened that
in the heat of it, the Volsci were inclosed by the Romans, and as it were shut up in their
own Camp. Vettius Mescins their General, finding their exigence, and that there was a
necessity of being killed; or making their way by the Sword, Ite mecum (says he to his
Soldiers) Non murus, nonvallum, armati armatis obstant, virtute pares, (quae ultimum 
maximum telum est) necessitate superiores estis. Follow me then couragiously, you have no
Wall, no Rampart, nothing but armed men to withstand you: you are equal to them in valour,
and being under necessity, have the same advantage of the Weapon. For Livy calls it in this place
the highest and heaviest of weapons.
Camillus one of the wisest of all the Roman Generals (having stormed and entred Veii
with some part of his Army) to facilitate his Victory, and take away from the Enemy
that last necessity of fighting; gave Orders (and so loud that the Vejentes might be sure to
hear) that no Soldier should dare to touch any man who had thrown down his Army, by
which Proclamation every man was encouraged to throw down his Arms, and the City
was taken with so little loss, that since that time, that Stratagem has been used by several
Commanders.


CHAP. XIII.
Whether we are more safe in a good General with a bad Army, or a good
Army with a bad General.
MArtius Coriolanus being banished from Rome, retired to the Volsci, where having
got an Army together, he returned to Rome to revenge himself for the injury his
fellow Citizens had done him, and he had done it effectually, had not the Prayers and
Piety of his Mother prevailed more upon him, than all the power of the Romans.
From which passage Titus Livius observes, that the Roman Commonwealth encreased more
by the virtue of their Commanders, than by the excellence of their Soldiers; because though
the Volsci had been always beaten before; yet when they got a Roman General, they were
too hard for the Romans: But though Livy was of that opinion in that place, yet in many
parts of his History there are instances, where the private Soldiers have done great things,
and sometimes fought better and in better order, after their Consuls were killed, than
they had done whilst they were living. Thus it happened in the Army which the Romans
had in Spain under the Command of the two Scipio's, which, when both their Comman|ders
were slain, behaved it self so well, that it not only defended it self, but defeated the
Enemy, and preserved that Province to the Romans, So that in the whole, there are examples
on both sides, where the Soldiers have done bravely, and got the Victory by their valour,
and where the Conduct of the General has done as much as a whole Army; from whence
it may be concluded that they are mutually useful, and that the Soldier is as much advan|taged
by the excellence of his General, as the General by the courage of his Army. How|ever,
this I think will not be unworthy our consideration, whether is most formidable, a
good Army under a bad Commander, or a good Commander with a bad Army: In the
opinion of Caesar neither of them was considerable; for when he went into Spain against
Afranius and Petreius, who had a good Army under their command, he went with much
confidence; because, as he said himself, Ibat ad exercitum sine duce, He went against an
Army without a head; reflecting thereby upon the insufficiency of their Generals. Again

when he went into Thessaly against Pompey, his expression was Vado an ducem fine Exercitu.
I go now against a General without an Army. It remains now that we consider whether it
be most easie for a good Captain to make a good Army, or a good Army to make a good
Captain. But to this, in my opinion, it is easily answered; for many good men in an
Army can sooner select one out of their number, and instruct him so, as that he may be
fit to command the rest, than the best General in the world can make an Army expert and
ready. Lucullus when he was sent against Mithridates, was utterly unexperienced in mat|ters
of War, yet being in a good Army, where his inferior Officers were good, he quickly
became a good General. The Romans for want of men, were forced to arm their Ser|vants,
and having referred them to be disciplin'd by Sempronius Graccus, in a short time
he made them excellent Soldiers. Pelopidas and Epominandas after they had rescued their
Country from the Tyranny of the Spartans, in a short time made their Country-men so
good Soldiers, that they were not only able to contend, but to conquer the Spartans. So that
the case is equal, and which soever is good, may make the other so too. Nevertheless a
good Army, without a good Commander, grows insolent and dangerous, as it hapned
in the Macedonian Army after Alexander was dead, and as it is in civil Wars among all old
Soldiers; so that I think if there be more confidence to be reposed in the one than in the
other, it is to be rather in the General, than the Army, especially if he has time to instruct
and discipline his Men; for an Army without a head, is insolent and mutinous. Those
Captains therefore are worthy of double honour, who have not only the Enemy to over|come;
but are to instruct, and prepare their Forces, before they bring them to engage.
And in doing so, they do highly recommend the Conduct of their General, which is so
rare a thing, that if the trouble were laid upon many, they would be much less esteemed
and respected than they are now.


CHAP. XIV.
What strange effects new inventions have sometimes in a Battle, and
how new Noises have the same.
WHat strange consequences have succeeded from sudden and unexpected accidents
that have been seen or heard in the heat of the Battel, appears by several examples
in History, but especially in the conflict betwixt the Romans and the Volsci, where Quintius
observing one of the wings of his Army to stagger and give ground, cry'd out to them to
stand firm, for that in the other wing the Victory was theirs; with which words he not
only reincouraged his own men, but put such a terror upon the Enemy, that they fled in
good earnest. And if in a well ordered Army those unexpected vociferations have such
wonderful effect, in a tumultuous and ill governed Army they have much more, where
everything is more subject to the agitation of such winds and of this we have a memo|rable
example of our times. The City of Perugia not many years since was divided into
two parts, the Oddi, and the Baglioni. The Baglioni prevailing, the Oddi were banished.
But the Oddi having got an Army together, and brought them privatly to a place not far
from Perugia, by the favour of their friends they were let one night into the Town, and
possessed themselves as far as the Piazza. And because the Streets were chained up from
one side to other to hinder the passage of the Horse, the Oddesche had a man who went
before them with a great engine of Iron wherewith he brake the chains, and he had done
his work so effectually, that he had broke all the chains, but what opened into the Piazza
the alarm being taken, and every body crying out Arm, Arm, he who broke down the
chains being pressed so close by the throng that was behind him, that he had not room for
his blow, cryed out to those that were next Back, Back, intending only to have made
more room for his arm: But they who were next him calling back to those who were be|hind
them, by degress the word went through the whole Army, and they who were in
the Rear not knowing the reason, began to run, and being followed by those who were
next, the whole Army retreated by little and little, till at last they brake out into an abso|lute
flight, by which inconsiderable accident, the Oddi were defeated of their design. So
that it is to be considered, that in a Battel, order is not only to be taken that the Army be
well drawn up, and put in a good posture to fight; but that no such trifling accident be
able to discompose it: For if for any thing the popular multitude be unfit for the Wars, it
is because every noise, rumour, or alarm, distracts them, and puts them to the rout. Wherefore
it ought to be a principal care in a good General to appoint such persons as are to receive

all orders and words of command, and derive them to the rest, that by so doing the Sol|diers
being accustomed to their Officers, may not receive any such orders, but from such
persons as are commissioned thereunto, the want of which custom has many times produc'd
very great confusion. As to apparitions, and such things as are many times seen, it is the
part of a good General, to contrive and exhibit (in the very height of the Battel) such
sights as may incourage his own men, and discourage the Enemy; for among many acci|dents
which conduce to your victory, this may be especially effectual. To this purpose is
that invention of which Sulpitius made use against the French; being drawn up, and
ready to engage the Enemy, he caused all the Servants and refuse of his Army to be
armed and mounted upon the Mules and Horses belonging to the Baggage; and having
furnished them so formally with Colours and Trumpets that they appeared a compleat
body of Horse, he disposed them behind a hill, where they were to continue, till in the
heat of the fight, they were to come forth and shew themselves to the Enemy; which
stratagem being as well executed as devised, struck such a terror into the French, that it
lost them the day. So that a good General has a double care upon him, to contrive by
these new surprizes to intimidate the Enemy; and to provide that if any such practices be
used upon him, he may discover, and defeat them. Thus an Indian King served Semi|ramis,
who observing the said King to be very strong in the number of Elephants, to fright
and persuade him that she was as strong as he, she caused several of her Camels to be
dress'd up, and covered with the Skins of Bufaloes and Bulls, that they might look big,
and carry the representation of Elephants; and having done so, she marched them in the
Van of her Army, but her design did not take; for the King having intelligence of it,
perverted it into her prejudice.
The Fidenates being besieged by Mamorcus the dictator, to terrifie the Roman Army
contrived to have several of the Townsmen in the heat of the Engagement to come sud|denly
out of the Town with Fire-works at the end of their Launces, hoping that the
newness of the sight might be a means to disturb them. And hear it is to be noted, that
when such stratagems have more of reality than pretence, they may very well be made
use of, because having something of solidity in them, their weakness is not so soon disco|vered,
but where they have more of appearance and fiction than truth, it is best either
not to use them at all, or if you do, to keep them at such a distance, as that their fallacy
may not be discerned; as Sulpitius did with his Muletiers; for when they are intrinsi|cally
weak, their vanity appears upon their approach, and they do more mischief than
good, as the Elephants of Semiramis, and the false fires of the Fidenates, which fires
though at first, they gave some disturbance to the Roman Souldiers; yet the Dictator
coming in, and questioning them aloud whether they were not ashamed to be smoaked
like Bees out of their Huts; encouraging them to turn again, he cryed out, Suis flammis
delete Fedenas quos vestris beneficiis placare non potuistis, Go to, destroy the Fidenae with
their own fires, seeing all your kindnesses have not been able to oblige them; and by so doing,
he defeated the Fidenates, and made their project unprofitable.


CHAP. XV.
One General is best for an Army, and that to govern it by
Commissioners, is not so good.
THe Fidenates having rebelled, and cut off that Colony of the Romans that was
amongst them, the Romans created four Tribunes, and invested with Consulary
power, whereof one being left behind for the security of the City of Rome, the other
three were sent against the Fidenates and Veientes; but disagreeing among them|selves,
they came off with dishonour, though their loss was not much: That they
gain'd no more honour, they may thank themselves; that they received no more loss, they
may thank their good Soldiers. However the Romans finding the inconvenience, re|turned
to their old way of Dictators, that what three persons had disordered, might be re|medied
by one. From whence we may discern the inconvenience of many Commanders
either in an Army or Town, which Livy has expressed very clearly in these following
words, Tres Tribuni potestate Consulari, documento fuere, quam plurium imperium bello in|utile
esset, tenendo ad sua quis Consilia, cum alii aliud videretur, apperuerunt ad occasionem
locum hosti; These three Tribunes with Consular power, gave us to understand the uselesness of
multiplicity of Commanders, for each of them adhering to his own Counsels, whilst one was

for one thing, and another as positive for another, nothing was done, and they gave the enemy an
advantage. And though this be example enough to prove the inconvenience of many
Commanders, yet for better illustration I shall add some others both ancient and modern.
In the year 1500 King Lewis XII of France having retaken Milan, sent his Army to Pisa
to recover it for the Florentines; who to command it had sent thither two Commissaries,
one of them called Giovan-battista Ridolsi, and the other Luca d' Antonio de gli Albizzi.
Giovan-battista was a person of reputation and gravity, and being ancienter than Luca,
Luca left the whole administration to him; but though he shewed no ambition in opposing
him; he did it abundantly by his silence, and fullenness; neglecting, and undervaluing every
thing that was done; so that he was so far from assisting his Colleague either with his coun|sel
or person, that he appeared as if he had been utterly ignorant in matters of war: but it pro|ved
otherwise afterwards, when upon some accident Giovan-battista was recalled, and Luca
remained behind with absolute Command; for then he gave ample testimony both of his
courage and conduct, which before, whilst he had a Colleague, no body could have believed.
To this purpose I shall add another saying of Livy, who giving an account how Quintius
and Agrippa (his Colleague) being sent against the Aequi, Agrippa would needs have the
whole management of the war to be committed to Quintius, for (says he) Saluberrimum
in administratione magnarum rerum est, summam imperii apud unum esse; In the administra|tion
of great affairs it is best that the Soveraign power be invested in one person. Which is
contrary to the present practice of our Princes and States, who do often depute more than
one Commander both to their Armies and Towns; which (however they think it for the
best) must needs breed inconceivable confusion. And if the cause of the ruine of so ma|ny
Italian and French Armies in our times, be enquired into, it will be found to be the mul|titude,
and emulation of their Commanders, and it be may safely concluded, that it is better
to send a man of ordinary prudence, and experience, upon any expedition, than two of
the wisest and best Soldiers they have, with equal commission.


CHAP. XVI.
That in times of difficulty, virtue is in esteem; in times of ease and luxury,
men of riches and alliance are in greatest request.
IT always was, and always will be the fortune of persons of more than ordinary endow|ments,
to be laid aside and neglected in times of peace, especially in a Commonwealth;
for that envy which is contracted by their virtue, sets up many Citizens against them, who
will not only be their equals, but superiors. To this purpose Thucidides (a Greek author)
has a place in his History, where he shews how the Republick of Athens, having had the
better in the Peloponesian War, depressed the pride of the Spartans, and subdued the greatest
part of Greece, was so inhansed and elated with their success, that it was proposed to fall
upon Sicily.
It was seriously debated in Athens whether the said enterprize should be undertaken or
not; Alcibiades and other Citizens of his party promoted it highly, not so much in respect
of the publick good as their own private advantage, expecting that the management of
that war would be placed in their hands. But Nicias (a person of the greatest reputation
in Athens) dissuaded it; and his great argument to make the People believe he spake his
judgment, and more for the benefit of the Commonwealth than any interest of his own,
was, that he advised rather contrary to his own advantage, because in time of peace there
were many of his fellow Citizens before him, but in time of war he knew he should be
the first: by which we may see it has been an ancient infirmity in Commonwealths not to
value persons of worth in time of peace, which disobliges them doubly; to see themselves
deprived of their dignities, and to see others preferred to them of less sufficiency than they,
which error has been the occasion of much confusion; for those persons who find them|selves
neglected, and know the reason of all is, the tranquillity of the times, make it their
business to embroil them, and put their Country upon war, though never so much to its
prejudice. And thinking sometimes with my self what remedies were most proper, I
could light but on two, one was to keep the Citizens from growing too rich, that wealth
without virtue might not be sufficient to advance any man, or able to corrupt other people,
or themselves: the other, so to prepare and adapt themselves for war, that they may never
be surprized, but have always employment forthe bravest of their Citizens, as Rome had in
the time of her prosperity. For that City having Armies always abroad, there was con|stant

exercise for the virtue of their Citizens: nor could a man of worth be degraded, nor
an improper man be prefer'd in his place, because when ever such a thing was done, (whe|ther
by way of error or experiment, it was the same) the disorders and dangers which fol|lowed,
were so sudden and great, that they quickly found their mistake, and return'd to
their old method again. But other Cities and States not so well constituted as that, which
make war only in cases of necessity, cannot defend themselves from those inconveniences
but are always in trouble and disorder, when ever that excellent Citizen which is neglected
is vindicative, and hath any reputation or part in the City. And though for some time
Rome kept her self free from these inconveniences, yet after she had conquered Carthage and
Antiochus, (as has been said before) and seemed to be past all fear of war for the future,
she chose several Commanders for her Army, not so much for their conduct or virtue, as
for those qualities which were likely to recommend them to the people. Paulus Aemilius
stood many times for the Consulship, and was repulsed; nor could he ever be made Con|sul
till the Macedonian war, which was committed unanimously to his conduct, because
they saw it was like to be dangerous and difficult. After the year 1494 our City of Flo|rence
being engaged in several wars in which none of our Citizens had perform'd any
great matter, at last the City hapned upon a person who shewed them after what manner an
Army was to be commanded, his name was Antonio Giacomini; whilst the war was dan|gerous,
and there was any trouble or difficulty to manage it, Antonio was free from the am|bition
of his fellow Citizens, and had no competitor in his election to be Commissary, and
General of their Armies: but when those were past, and new wars that were more easie and
honourable were to be undertaken, he had so many competitors, that when three Commissa|ries
were to be chosen for the reduction of Pisa, Antonio could not obtain to be one: and
though it be not manifest what inconveniences accrewed to the Commonwealth by the wa|ving
of Antonio, yet it may be easily conjectured, for the Pisans being distressed for want
of provisions, and having nothing left wherewithal to defend themselves, (had Antonio
been there) would have been forc'd to have surrendred at discretion; but being besieged
by such Officers as knew not how to streighten or press them, they held out so long, that the
Florentines were glad to buy them out at last, whereas they might as well have had them by
force. No question but Antonio resented it highly, and he had need be a good man, and of
more than ordinary patience not to think of revenging himself, though with the subversion
of the whole City, (if he could) and the ruine of every private Citizen, which is to be
carefully prevented by every State, as shall be shewn in the following Chapter.


CHAP. XVII.
A man is not to be disobliged, and employed afterwards in any matter of
importance.
A Commonwealth is diligently to provide that no Citizen be entrusted in any weighty
affair, who has received any remarkable injury; Claudius Nero (who divided
the Army which was designed to confront Hanibal, and marched away with a strong party
into la Mara to joyn with the other Consul, and engage Asdrubal before he got up with
his supplies to Hanibal) having formerly commanded the Roman Army in Spain against the
said Asdrubal, had come off with dishonour; for though he had enclosed Asdrubal and his
whole Army, and so possest himself of all passes, that he must either fight with disadvantage,
or perish with hunger, yet he was over-reach'd with the subtilty of the Carthaginian, who
drill'd him on with pretended overtures of peace, till at length in the night he stole his
Army thorow the woods, and got of where he was safe. This passage being known in
Rome, was no small diminution to Nero's reputation both with the Senate and the People:
but being afterwards made Consul, and sent with an Army against Hanibal, he ventured
upon that desperate counsel of dividing the Army, which was a thing so doubtful and un|certain
in the opinion of the Romans, that the City was in strange anxiety and suspence
till they had the news of his Victory. It is reported that when Claudius Nero was que|stioned
afterwards by his friends what it was that mov'd him to so hazardous an enterprize,
in which, without necessary provocation, he had ventured the whole liberty of their
Country, he answered, he had done it, because he knew if he succeded, he should recover
that honour which he had lost in Spain; if he miscarried, and his design should have a con|trary
end, he should have had the satisfaction to have been revenged of the City and Citi|zens,
by whom he had been so ingratefully, and so indiscreetly calumniated. And if the

indignation arising from these kind of provocations could work so strongly upon a Roman
Citizen, in those times when Rome was in its innocence; we may easily imagine what pro|digious
effects it may have upon persons in a City not so well constituted as that; and be|cause
against these kind of disorders (to which all Commonwealths are subject) no certain
remedy can be prescrib'd, it follows that no Commonwealth can be possibly perpetual,
forasmuch as a thousand unexpected accidents fall in, to hasten its destruction.


CHAP. XVIII.
Nothing is more honourable in a General, than to foresee the Designs of his
Enemy.
IT was the saying of Epaminondas the Theban, that no one quality was more useful and
necessary in a General, than to be able to know the resolutions and designs of his Enemy,
and discover that by conjecture, which he could not do by any certain intelligence. Nor
is it difficult only to understand his designs, but his actions; and of those actions not only
such as are perform'd privately, or at a distance, but such as are done (as it were) before his
Face. For it many times falls out, that when a Battel continues till night, he who has the
better, believes he has the worst; and who has lost all, supposes he has the Victory. Which
mistakes has put the Generals many times upon pernicious counsels, as it hapned betwixt
Brutus and Cassius; for Brutus having defeated the Enemy with his Wing. Cassius suppo|sing
he had been lost, and his whole Body dispers'd, killed himself in despair. In our times,
at the Battel of S. Cilicia in Lombardy, Francis King of France coming to an engagement
with the Swizzers, the Fight continued till night: a body of the Swizzers remaining en|tire,
and hearing nothing of the defeat and execution of their Comrades, concluded the
Victory was theirs, which error was the occasion that they marched not off as they might
have done, but kept their ground till the next morning, at which time they were charged
again, and overthrown.
The same error had almost ruined the Armies of the Pope and King of Spain, who upon
a false alarm of the Victory of the Swizzers, passed the Po, and advanced so far, that
ere they were aware they had like to have fallen into the mouths of the victorious French.
The like fell out of old in the Camps of the Romans and Aequi; Sempronius the Consul
being commanded out with an Army against the enemy, and forcing him to a Battel, it
continued till night without any visible advantage on either side. Night coming on, and
both Armies sufficiently spent, neither of them retir'd to their Camps, but betook them|selves
to the neighbouring hills, where they believed they should be more safe. The Ro|man
Army divided into two parts, one went with the Consul, and the other with Tempa|nius
the Centurion, by whose courage the Roman Army was preserved that day. The
next morning the Consul hearing no more of the enemy, retreated towards Rome; the
Aequi with their Army did the same, for both of them though they had been beaten, and
marched away without regarding the loss or plunder of their Camps it hapned that Tem|panius
being behind with his squadron, and marching off as the rest, he took certain of
the wounded Aequi prisoners, who inform'd him that their Generals were gone out of the
field, and had quitted their Camps. Upon enquiry finding it to be true, he entred into
the Roman, and secured it, but the enemies Camp was given in prey to the Souldier, after
which he returned with Victory to Rome, which Victory consisted only in having the first
intelligence of the enemies disorder: from whence it is observable that two Armies en|gaged,
may be each of them in the same distress and despair, and that that Army goes away
with the Victory which has first notice of the necessities of the other, and of this I shall
give a pregnant example of late days, and at home. In the year 1498 the Florentines had
a great Army in the Country of Pisa, and had besieged that City very close. The Vene|tian
having undertaken its protection, and seeing no other way to relieve it; to divert the
enemy, and remove the war, they resolved to invade the Territory of the Florentine; to
which purpose they raised a strong Army, marched into their Country by the Val di Lamo|na,
possessed themselves of the Town of Marradi, and besieged the Castle of Castiglione
which stands above upon an hill. The Florentines upon the alarm resolved to relieve Mar|adi,
and yet not weaken their Army before Pisa, whereupon they raised a new Army both
Horse and Foot, and sent them thither under the Command of Iacopo Quarto Appiano
(Lord of Piombino) and the Count Rinuccio da Marciano. The Florentine Army being
conducted to the hills, the Venetian raised his siege before Castiglione, and retreated into the

Town: the Armies being in this posture, and facing one another for several days, both of
them suffered exceedingly for want of all manner of Provisions; at length neither of them
being very earnest to come to a Battel, and each of them being ignorant of the others
distress, they resolved the next morning to break up their Camp, and each of them to re|tire,
the Venetian towards Berzighella and Faenza, and the Florentine towards Casaglia and
Mugello. The morning being come, and the Baggage sent away before, a poor Woman
hapned to come into the Florentine Camp, from Marradi to see some of her Relations who
were in the service of the Florentine: by this Woman the Florentine Generals had notice
that the Venetians were gone; whereupon reassuming their courage, they altered their
counsels, pursued the enemy, and writ Letters to Florence, that they had not only beaten the
Venetians, but made an end of the War. Which Victory proceeded from nothing but be|cause
they had the first news of the retreat of the Enemy, which if it had come to the
other side, as it did to them, the consequence would have been the same, and the Floren|tines
have been beaten.


CHAP. XIX.
Whether for the Government of the multitude, obsequiousness and idulgence
be more necessary than punishment.
THe Roman Commonwealth was perplexed with the dissentions betwixt the Nobility,
and the people; nevertheless, their foreign Wars requiring it, they sent forth with
their Armies, Quintius and Appius Claudius: Appius being rough, and cruel in his com|mands,
was so ill obeyed by his Soldiers, that he was defeated, and fled out of his Pro|vince.
Quintius being more gentle and benign, was better obeyed, and carried the Vi|ctory
where he was; from whence it appears more conducing to the well governing of a
multitude, to be rather obliging, than proud, and pitiful, than cruel. However Cornelius
Tacitus tells us, (and many others are of his mind) In multitudine regend plus paena quam
obsequium valet, That to the managing of a multitude, severity is more requisite than mildness.
And I think both may be true to his distinction, of Companions and Subjects; if those
under your command be Companions and fellow Citizens with you, you cannot securely
use them with that severity, of which Tacitus speaks; for the people of Rome having equal
authority with the Nobility, was not to be used ruggedly by any man that was put over
them for but a while. And it has been many times seen that the Roman Generals, who
behaved themselves amicably towards their Souldiers, and governed them with mildness,
have done greater things than those who used them with austerity, and kept them in per|petual
fear, unless they were endued with more than ordinary virtue, like Manlius Torqua|tus.
But he whose command is over his Subjects, (of whom Cornelius speaks) is to have
a care they grow not insolent, and contemn him for his easiness, and there, is rather to use
severity than gentleness with them; yet that is to be done (too) with such moderation,
that they may be kept from abhorring him; for the hatred of the Subject is never good
for a Prince, and the best way to prevent it, is by not interrupting the Subject in the quiet en|joyment
of his Estate; for blood (unless there be some design of rapacity under it) no
Prince does desire it, but upon some extraordinary necessity, and that necessity happens but
seldom. But when cruelty and rapine meet together in the nature of one person, there ne|ver
wants desire, nor pretences for cruelty, as I have demonstrated largely in another Trea|tise
upon this occasion. Quintius therefore deserved more praise than Appius deserved:
and the saying of Tacitus is true enough with the aforesaid restriction, but not in the case of
Appius: and because I have spoken of kindness and severity, I will give you one example,
how mildness prevailed more upon the Falisci than violence could do.



CHAP. XX.
One instance of humanity wrought more upon the Falisci, than all the force
of the Romans.
CAmillus having besieged the Falisci, and attempted many things against them but in
vain, a School-master who had the tuition of several of the principal young Gentle|men
of that City, thinking to gratifie Camillus, and ingratiate with the people of Rome,
carrying them out of the walls, under pretence of exercise and recreation, he conveyed
them all into the Camp of Camillus, and presenting them to him, told him, that by their
means he might become Master of the Town: Camillus was so far from accepting his pre|sent,
that he caused the Paedagogue to be strip'd, and his hands tied behind him, and then
putting a rod into every one of the young Gentlemens hands, he caused them scourge
him back again into the Town: which piece of humanity and justice when the Citizens
understood, they resolved to defend themselves no longer, and so immediately surrendred:
a great example doubtless, and by which we may learn, that many times kindness and ge|nerosity
moves an Enemy more than all the force and artifice of war; for 'tis frequently seen
that those Provinces and Cities which no violence or stratagem have subdued, have been
melted and wrought upon by one single act of pity, chastity, or liberality: and of this
History is full of many other examples besides. Pyrrhus could not be got out of Italy by
all the power of the Romans; and yet Fabritius sent him packing by one act of generosity,
and that was giving him notice that some of his intimates would poison him, and had
made overtures to the Romans to that purpose. Again, Scipio Africanus got not so much
honour by the taking of Carthage, as he did by one act of chastity, when he sent home a
young beautiful Lady (that was taken prisoner, and presented to him) untouch'd to her
Husband; for at the news of that one act, all Spain was astonished, and began to admire
the virtue and innocence of the Romans, which virtue is a thing so universally celebrated,
that there are no great persons endued with it, but are highly esteemed by all people, as ap|pears
by all Ethicks, Politicks, and History, among which, the History of Xenophon is
abundantly copious, in demonstrating what Honours and what Victories accrewed to Cyrus
upon the bare account of his affability and mildness; and how he was never guilty of the
least pride, or cruelty, or luxury, or any other vice that defiles the conversation of man.
Nevertheless, seeing Hanibal did the same things, and by a contrary way, it will not be
amiss in the next Chapter to enquire the reason.


CHAP. XXI.
How it came to pass that Hanibal by methods quite contrary to what were pra|ctised
by Scipio, did the same things in Italy that the other did in Spain.
I Doubt not but it may seem strange to some people, that other Captains who have taken
a quite contrary way to what is prescribed in my last Chapter, should notwithstanding
have had the same success; for from thence it seems to follow, that Victory does not depend
either upon humanity or justice, when we see the same praise and reputation acquir'd by
quite contrary habits: and to prove this, we need not go far for examples, the same Sci|pio
whom we mentioned before, being with an Army in Spain, carried himself with so
much piety, and justice, and liberality to all people, that he got the love of the whole Pro|vince:
on the other side we see Hanibal in Italy acting quite contrary, and with violence,
cruelty, rapine, and all manner of infidelity persecuting the people, and yet with the same
laudable effects as Scipio had in Spain. And considering with my self what might be the
reason, they seemed to me to be several. The first is, because men are studious of novelty,
and that not only those who are under slavery or subjection, but those who are free, and in
peace; for (as is said before) men are as well satiated with happiness, as afflicted with
misery.
This desire (therefore) of change opens a door to any man that invades a Province
with any considerable force: if he be a foreigner, they all follow after him, if a native,
they attend him, assist him, and encourage him: so that let him take which way he pleases,
he must needs make great progress in those places. Again, people are generally excited

two ways, either by love, or by fear; so that he that is feared, is often times as readily
obeyed as he that is beloved, and sometimes more. It is not material therefore to a Com|mander
which of these two ways he takes; for if he be a virtuous person, and of any
extraordinary faculties, he will be admired by the people, as Hanibal and Scipio were,
whose great worth effaced, or covered all the faults that they committed. But in either of
these two ways, great inconveniences may arise, and such as may ruine a Prince. For he
who desires to be beloved, upon the least excess or immoderation in his Courtship, is sub|ject
to be despised; and he on the other side who affects to be feared, upon the least extra|vagance
makes himself odious: and to keep the middle way exactly, is not possible to our
nature; wherefore it is necessary to those who exceed in either kind, to attone for it with
some extraordinary virtue, as Hanibal and Scipio did, who though persons of great pru|dence
and conduct, yet it appeared that both of them suffered by their manner of living,
as well as they were advanced. Their advancement is mentioned before; their sufferings
(as to Scipio) was the rebellion of his Army, and part of his friends in Spain, which pro|ceded
from nothing but want of being feared, for men are naturally so unquiet, that every
little door that is opened to their ambition sets them agog, and abolishes all that love
which they ow'd to their Prince for his humanity towards them, as in this example of
the Friends and Army of Scipio; wherefore Scipio was constrained to make use of that
severity in some measure, which he had always declined. As to Hanibal, there is not any
particular example where his cruelty or infidelity did him hurt; only it may be supposed
that they were the occasion why Naples and several other Towns stood so firm to the Ro|mans.
It is plain likewise that his bloodiness and impiety made him more odious to the
people of Rome, than all the Enemies that ever that City had: for whereas when Pyrrhus
was with a great Army in Italy, they gave him notice of a design on foot to have poisoned
him, they were so inveterate against Hanibal, that they never forgave him, but when they
had defeated and disarm'd him, they pursued him to the death. And these sad inconve|niences
hapned to Hanibal from no other causes, but because he was impious, unfaithful,
and cruel: but then on the other side he had the advantage of being admired of all Wri|ters
for keeping his Army without any mutiny or dissention either against him, or among
themselves, though it consisted of so many different Nations, which could be derived from
nothing but the awe and terror of his person; which terror was so great, (considered with
the reputation and authority that he received from his valour) that thereby he kept his
Souldiers united and quiet. I conclude therefore, it imports not much which way a Ge|neral
takes, so there be any great excellence in him to recommend it; for (as is said before)
both in the one and the other there is danger and defect, if there be not some extraordi|nary
virtue to balance it. And if Hanibal and Scipio, one by laudable, and the other by
ignominous and detestable ways arrived at the same end, and had the same effects, I think
it convenient in my next Chapter to discourse of two Roman Citizens, who by divers ways
(but both honourable) arrived at the same pitch of glory and renown.


CHAP. II.
How the austerity of Manlius Torquatus, and the humanity of Valerius Cor|vinus
gain'd each of them the same honour and reputation.
THere were two famous Captains contemporary in Rome, Manlius Torquatus, and Va|lerius
Corvinus, both of them equal in courage, equal in their triumphs, and each of
them (as to the enemy) acquir'd all with equal virtue and terror; but as to their own Armies,
and manner of discipline, it was quite different. Manlius commanded with all kind of
severity, excused his Souldiers from no labour, nor no punishment. Valerius on the other
side used them with as much gentleness and familiarity: Manlius to keep his Souldiers
strictly to their discipline, executed his own son; which Valerius was so far from imitating,
that he never offended any man: yet in this great diversity of conduct, the effects were
the same, both as to the Enemy, the Commonwealth, and themselves; for none of their
Souldiers ever declin'd fighting; none of them rebelled, or so much as disputed their
commands, though the discipline of Manlius was so severe, that afterwards all excessive
and extravagant commands were called Manliana imperia: in which place it is not amiss
to enquire how it came to pass that Manlius was constrained to so rigorous a method; what
it was that made Valerius comport himself so mildly: how it was that this different way
of proceeding should have the same effect; and last of all, which of the two is most wor|thy

thy to be imitated. If Manlius be considered as he is represented by the Historian, he will
be found to be very valiant, carrying himself with great piety to his Father, and Country,
and with great reverence to his Superiors, which appeared by his defence of his Father
with the hazard of his own life against a Tribune who accused him; and by his fighting
with the Gaul, in the behalf of his Country, which notwithstanding he would not under|take
without orders from the Consul; for when he saw a vast man, of a prodigious pro|portion,
marching forth upon the Bridge, and challenging any of the Romans, he went mo|destly
to the Consul for leave, and told him, Injussa tuo adversus hostem, nunquam pugnabo,
non si certain victoriam videam; Without your permission I will never engage with the enemy,
though I was sure to overcome: and the Consul giving him leave, he conquered his enemy.
When therefore a man of his constitution arrives at such a command, he desires all men
may be as punctual as himself and being naturally brave, he commands brave things, and
when they are once commanded, requires that they be executed exactly; and this is a cer|tain
rule, when great things are commanded, strict obedience must be expected, otherwise
your enterprize must fail. That therefore those under your command may be the more
obedient to your commands, it is necessary that you command aright; and he commands
right, who compares his own quality and condition with the quality and condition of
those they command; if he finds them proportionable, then he may command, if other|wise,
he is to forbear; and therefore that saying was not amiss, that to keep a Common|wealth
in subjection by violence, it was convenient that there should be a proportion be|twixt
the persons forced, and forcing; and whilst that proportion lasted, the violence might
last too, but when that proportion was dissolved, and he that was forced grew stronger
than he that offered it, it was to be doubted much his authority would not hold long. But
to return; great things therefore, and magnificent, are not to be commanded but by a man
that is great and magnificent himself; and he who is so constituted, having once commanded
them, cannot expect, that mildness or gentleness will prevail with his subjects to execute
them: but he that is not of this greatness and magnificence of mind, is by no means to
command extraordinary things; and if his commands be but ordinary, his humanity may
do well enough, for ordinary punishments are not imputed to the Prince, but to the Laws
and Customs of the place: so that we may conclude Manlius was constrained to that se|verity
by his natural temper and complexion; and such persons are many times of great
importance to a Commonwealth, because by the exactness of their own lives, and the
strictness of their discipline, they revive the old Laws, and reduce every thing towards its
first principles:
And if a State could be so happy to have such persons succeeding one another in any
reasonable time, as by their examples would not only renew the laws, restrain vice, and re|move
every thing that tended to its ruine or corruption, that State would be immortal. So
then Manlius was a severe man, and kept up the Roman discipline exactly, prompted first
by his own nature, and then by a strong desire to have that obeyed, which his own inclina|tion
had constrained him to command. Valerius Corvinus on the other side might exer|cise
his gentleness without inconvenience, because he commanded nothing extraordinary,
or contrary to the customs of the Romans at that time; which custom, being good, was
sufficient to honour him, and not very troublesom to observe, whereby it hapned that Va|lerius
was not necessitated to punish offenders, because there were but very few of that
sort, and when there were any, their punishment (as is said before) was imputed to the
Laws, and not to the cruelty of the Prince; by which it fell out that Valerius had an op|portunity
by his gentleness to gain both affection and authority in the Army, which was
the cause that the Souldiers being equally obedient to one as well as the other, though their
humours and discipline were different, yet they might do the same things, and their actions
have the same effects. If any are desirous to imitate either of them, they will do well to
have a care of running into the same errors as Scipio and Hanibal did before, which is not
to be prevented any other way, but by singular virtue and industry. These things being
so, it remains now that we enquire which of those two ways are most laudable to follow,
and it is the harder to resolve, because I find Authors are strangely divided, some for one
way, and others for the other. Nevertheless, they who pretened to write how a Prince is
to govern, are more inclinable, to Valerius than Manlis, and Xenophon in his character of
Cyrus jumps exactly with Livy's description of Valerius, especially in his expedition against
the Samnites when he was Consul: for the morning before the Fight he made a speech to
his Souldiers with that mildness and humanity, that the Historian tells us, Non alis militi
familiarior dux fuit, inter infimos militum omnia haud gravate munia obeundo. In ludo
praeterea militari, cum velocitatis, viriumque inter se aequales cort amina ineunt, comiter facilis
vincere, ac vinci, vultu eodem; nec quenquam aspernari parem qui se offerret; factis benig nus

prore; dictis, haud minus libertatis alienae quam suae dignitatis memor,  (quo nihil popu|larius
est) quibus artibus petierat Magistratum, iisdem Gerebat. No General was ever more
familiar with his Soldiers; no Soldier too mean for him to converse with, no office too base for
him to undertake. In their Military recreations when they ran, or wrestled for a prize, he
would not only run or wrestle, but win or lose, be overcome, or conquer, with the same evenness,
and unconcernment; nor did he ever disdain or refuse any man that challenged him. In his
actions, he was bountiful, as occasion was offered; in his words, he was as mindful of other
peoples liberty, as of his own dignity, and (which is the most grateful thing to the people in
the world) the same arts which he used in the obtaining, the same he exercised in the manage|ment
of his Magistracy.
Livy speaks likewise very honorably of Manlius acknowledging that his severity upon
his Son, made the whole Army so obedient, and diligent, that it was the occasion of their
victory against the Latins; and he goes so far in his praise, that after he has given an exact
account of the Battel and victory; and described all the dangers and difficulties to which
the Romans were exposed, he concludes that it was only the Conduct and courage of Man|lius
that got the victory that day; and afterwards comparing the strength of both Armies,
he does not scruple to say, that on which side soever Manlius had been, that side would
certainly have had the day. Which being so, makes my question very hard to determine,
nevertheless, that it may not be altogether unresolved, I conceive that in a Citizen brought
up under the strictness of a Commonwealth, the way of Manlius would be best, and
least subject to danger, because it seems most for the interest of the publick, and not at all
proceeding from private ambition; besides to carry ones self severely to every body, and
pursue nothing but the benefit of the Publick, is not a way to make parties, or friends,
without which there can be no troubles in a State. So that he who proceeds in that man|ner,
must needs be very useful, and not at all suspicious to the State. But the way of Va|lerius
is quite contrary; for though the Commonwealth reaps the same fruits as in the
other; yet jealousies will arise, and people will be fearful that in the end his great favour
among the Souldiers will be employed to set up himself, with very ill consequences upon
their liberty. And if in Publicola's time these ill effects did not happen, it was because
as then the minds of the Romans were not corrupt, nor had he been long enough in
authority. But if we consider a Prince, as Xenophon did, in that case we must leave
Manlius, and follow Valerius clearly; because a Prince is by all means to endeavour the
obedience of his Subjects and Soldiers by ways of amity and kindness. They will be
obedient, if they find him virtuous, and a strict observer of his Laws; they will love
him, if they see him courteous, and affable, and merciful, and endued with all the good
qualities which were in Valerius, and which Xenophon attributes to Cyrus. For to be
particularly beloved, and have an Army true to his interest, is instar omnium, and answers
to all other policies of State. But it is otherwise when an Army is commanded by one
who is a Citizen of the same City with the rest of his Army; for he is subject to the same
Laws and Magistrates as well as they. In the Annals of Venice we read, that in former
times the Venetian Galleys returning from some expedition, and lying near the Town,
there happened a quarrel betwixt the Citizens and the Seamen, which proceeded so far,
that it came to a tumult, both sides betook themselves to their Arms, and neither the power
of their Officers, the reverence of the Citizens, nor the authority of the Magistrate was
able to quiet them: But as soon as a certain Gentleman appeared, who had commanded
them the year before, remembring with what courtesie he had behaved himself, their
kindness to him prevail'd above all other courses, and they gave over the combat, and
retir'd; but that affection, and ready obedience to his commands, cost the poor Gentle|man
very dear; for thereby he became so obnoxious to the Senate, that not long after, they
secured themselves against him, either by imprisonment or death. I conclude then, that
a Prince may better follow the example of Valerius; but to a Citizen, it is dangerous both
to himself, and the State; to the State, because that way leads directly to Tyranny; to
himself, because (let his intentions be never so innocent) he will certainly be suspected,
and bring himself in danger. So on the other side, the severity of Manlius is as perni|cious
in a Prince, but in a Citizen it is convenient, and particularly for the State; for it ne|ver does
hurt, if the hatred which follows your severity be not encreased by a jealousie of
your great virtue and reputation, as it happen'd to Camillus.



CHAP. XXIII.
Vpon what occasion Camillus was banished from Rome.
WE have concluded in the Chapter before, that to imitate Valerius may prejudice
your Country, and your self; and that to imitate Manlius may be convenient for
your self, and prejudicial to your Country; which opinion is much confirmed by the case
of Camillus, whose proceedings were more like Manlius, than Valerius; for which rea|son,
Livy speaking of him tells us, Ejus virtutem milites oderant,  Mirabantur. His
virtue was both odious, and admirable to his Soldiers. That which made him admired was
his Diligence, Prudence, Magnanimity, and Conduct: That which made him hated was,
that he was more severe in punishing, than liberal in rewarding. And of this hatred
Livy gives these following reasons: First, because he caused the Money which was made
of the goods of the Vejentes to be applyed to publick use, and not distributed with the
rest of the prey: Next, because in his Triumphal Chariot he caused himself to be drawn
by four white Horses, which was accounted so great a piece of arrogance, that it was thought
he did it to equalize the Sun. A third was, that he had devoted a tenth part of the spoils
of the Vejentes to Apollo, which (to keep his Vow) was to be taken back again from the
Soldiers who had got it in their clutches: From whence it may be observed, that nothing
makes a Prince more odious to the people, than to deprive them of their possessions, which
is a thing of so great importance, that it is never forgotten; because upon every little want,
it comes fresh into their Memories, and men being daily subject to those wants, will daily
remember it; and next to this is, being insolent and proud, which is likewise extreamly
odious to the people, especially if they be free. And although perhaps no detriment ac|crews
to them from his pride, yet they are observed always to detest him that uses it. So
that a great person is to avoid it as a rock, because it begets hatred, and that without any
advantage, which makes it a very rash, and imprudent thing.


CHAP. XXIV.
The prolongation of Commissions brought Rome first into servitude.
IF the dissolution of the Roman Commonwealth be accurately considered, it will be
found to proceed partly from the differences about the Agrarian Law, and partly from
the prorogation of their Magistrates, which errors, had they been known in time, and due
remedies applyed, would not have been so pernicious, but Rome might have enjoyed her
freedom longer, and perhaps with more quiet. For though from the prolongation of
Offices there were no tumults no seditions to be seen in that City; yet it was clear that
those Magistrates which were continued took much upon them, and by degrees their power
and authority became a great prejudice to the liberty of the State. Had all the Citizens
who were continued, been wise, and honest like L. Quintius, they would not have incurred
this inconvenience. The goodness of Quintius appeared in one thing very remarkably; a
meeting being appointed for accommodation of the differences betwixt the Nobility, and the
People; the people continued their authority to their Tribunes another year, as believing
them very proper to resist the ambition of the Nobles: The Senate to retaliate upon the
people, and show themselves as considerable as they, continued the Consulship to Quintius;
But Quintius refused it absolutely, alledging that ill examples were to be stifled, and not
encreased by others that were worse, and therefore pressed them to the election of new
Consuls, and prevailed with much importunity and contention. Had the rest of the Roman
Citizens imitated this person, they had never admitted that custom of proroguing of Ma|gistrates,
and then the prolongation of their Commands in the Army had never been
introduced, which very thing was at length the ruine of that Commonwealth. The first
person whose Commission was continued in Rome, was P. Philo, who having besieged Pale-polis,
and by the time his Consulship was to expire, reduced it to such extremity, that the
victory seemed already in his hands. The Senate would not send another to succeed him,
but continued his authority with the Title of Proconsul, which thing (though done then
upon grave consideration, and for the benefit of the publick) proved afterwards of such

ill consequence, that it brought that City in servitude and slavery: For by how much their
Wars were more remote, by so much they thought these prorogations convenient; from
whence it hapned, that fewer of the Romans were prepared for Military Commands, and
the glory of their Victories redounded but to few: and besides, he whose Commission
was renew'd, and had been a long time accustomed to the Army, might insinuate so, and
gain such an interest in it, as might make it disclaim the Senate, and acknowledg no Head
but their General. This it was that enabled Marius and Sylla to debauch the Army; this
was it that enabled Caesar to conquer his native Country; which miseries had never hap|ned,
had not that custom of continuing Magistrates, and Commanders been introduced.
If it be objected, that their great affairs could not have been managed as so great a di|stance,
without that prorogation of commands; I answer; That 'tis possible their Em|pire
might have been longer before it came to that height; but then it would have been
more lasting, for the adversary would never have been able to have erected a Monarchy,
and destroyed their liberty so soon.


CHAP. XXV.
Of the Poverty of Cincinnatus and several other Citizens of Rome.
WE have said elsewhere, that nothing is of more importance to the conservation of
the liberty of a State, than to keep the Citizens low, and from being too weal|thy.
Whether there was any Law to that purpose, or what that Law was, I must acknow|ledge
my ignorance, (especially when I consider with what zealand passion the Agrarian
was opposed) yet 'tis clear by experience, that for 400 years after the building of Rome,
that City was in very great poverty: And it is probable the great cause of it was, that
poverty was no impediment to preferment: Virtue was the only thing required in the Ele|ction
of Magistrates, and the distribution of Offices; and wherever it was found, let the
person or family be never so poor, it was sure to be advanced; which manner of living,
made riches contemptible: And this is manifest by the following example. Minutius the
Consul being circumvented, and he and his whole Army, as it were block'd up by the
Aequi, the Romans were so possess'd with the danger of their Army, that they betook
themselves to the creation of a Dictator, which is their last remedy in their greatest affli|ctions:
They concluded upon L. Quintius Cincinnatus, who was then (when they sent for
him) in a little Country farm at Plough, which Livy magnifies exceedingly, and says;
Operae pretium est audire, qui omnia prae divitiis humana spernunt, neque honori magno locum,
que virtuti putant esse, nisi effuse affluant opes: It is pleasant to hear some people talk of
rches, as if nothing in this world were comparable to them; as if all honour and virtue
depended only upon the Estate. Cincinnatus (as I said before) was at Plough in his Farm,
(which consisted only of four acres of ground) when the Embassadors came to him from
the Senate to salute him Dictator, and to remonstrate their distress. Having received their
message, he made no delay, but call'd immediately for his Robe, came directly for Rome,
rais'd his Army, and marched away for the relief of Minutius: having defeated at the
Enemy, and pillaged their Camp, he would not suffer the Army of Minutius to participate
in the prize, telling him, I do not think it reasonable that you should have share in the prey,
who was so near being a prey your self After which he degraded Minutius of his Consul|ship,
and made him only a Legate with this expression; You shall continue here in this Sta|tion;
till you learn to behave your self more like a Consul. The same Dictator, in the same
expedition, made L. Tarquinius his Master of his Horse, though he had none to be Master of
his own, for his poverty was such, he was forced to serve on foot. 'Tis remarkable
how in those days poverty and honour were not so inconsistant as now, and that to an ex|cellent
and worthy person as Cincinnatus was, four acres of Land was a sufficient Estate.
In the days of Atilius Regulus poverty was in the same reputation; for being at the head
of an Army in Africa, and having conquered the Carthaginians, he made it his request to
the Senate that he might be permitted to come home, and husband his own Farm, which
his Servants had neglected. And this frugallty of the Romans is exceedingly wonderful;
for looking for nothing but praise and honour from their Victories, they brought all their
prize into the publick Treasury: and doubtless had Regulus proposed any thing of advan|tage
to himself by that War, he would never have been concerned to have had his four
acres neglected by his Servants. Nor was the modesty and magnanimity of the Romans
less remarkable, who being put into command, and placed at the head of an Army, thought

themselves above any Prince; no King, no Commonwealth was able to dismay them: But
when their Commissions expired, and they were returned privately to their houses; no body
so frugal, no body so humble, no body so laborious, so obedient to the Magistrates, or
respectful to their superiors as they; insomuch that one would have thought it impossible
the same minds should have been capable of such strange alterations. And this poverty
continued till the time of Paulus Emilius (which was the last age of that Commonwealths
happiness) for though he by his Triumph enriched the whole City, yet not regarding his
own fortunes, he continued poor himself, and poverty was in that esteem, that Paulus to
gratifie and encourage one of his Sons-in-Law who had behaved himself bravely in those
Wars, gave him a silver Cup, which was the first piece of Plate that was ever seen in his
family. And here I have a fair occasion to enlarge upon poverty, and show how much
more useful it is to Mankind than riches, and how many excellent Arts it has produced and
improved, which riches and luxury have destroyed: But this having been treated of so
amply by other people before, I shall mention it no farther at this time.


CHAP. XXVI.
Women are many times the destruction of States.
IN the City of Ardea there was a great controversie betwixt the Patricii and the People,
about the Marriage of a young Lady; who being a great Fortune, had a great many
Servants, but more especially two, one of them a Patrician, the other a Plebean. Her
Father being dead, her Guardian would needs bestow her upon the Plebean; her Mother
was for the Nobleman; not agreeing among themselves, it came to a tumult, and by de|grees
to blows; insomuch as the whole Nobility appeared in Arms for the one, and all the
people for the other. The result was, the people being beaten out of the Town, and
sending to the Volsci for aid, the Nobles sent to Rome. The Volsci were readiest, and com|ing
first to the assistance of the Plebeans, they clap'd down before the Town. They had
not entrench'd themselves long, but the Roman Army came upon their backs and shut
them up betwixt the Town and them; insomuch that they were quickly distressed, and
forced to surrender at discretion. The Romans entred the Town, killed all that were
accessary to the sedition, and setled their affairs. In which passage there are many obser|vable
things. First, we see Women have been the occasion of much desolation, prejudice,
and dissention: The Rape of Lucrece lost the Tarquins their Government; the attempt
upon Virginia, was the ruine of the Decem-viri. And Aristotle in his Politicks imputes
the abomination of Tyranny to the injuries they do to people upon the account of Wo|men,
by their Debauchments, their Violences, or Adulteries, as we have show'd at large
in our Chapter about Conspiracies. So that in the Government of any Kingdom or
Commonwealth, those things are not to be reckon'd as trifles, but as the occasions of
much mischief, and are by all means to be prevented, before the rancour has taken too deep
root, and is not to be cured, but by the destruction of the State: as it hapned to the Ar|deates,
who let it go so long among their fellow Citizens, that at last they came to an ab|solute
division not to be composed nor setled, but by foreign assistance, which is always the
forerunner of servitude and slavery.


CHAP. XXVII.
How the civil discords in a City, are to be composed, and of the falsity of
that opinion, That the best way to keep a City in subjection, is to keep
it divided.
IN the reconciliation of a City that is labouring under civil dissentions, we are to follow
the example of the Roman Consuls, and observe their method in composing the distra|ctions
among the Ardeates, which was by cutting off the chief Actors, and confiscating
their Estates. And to compose the distractions of a City, there are three ways; either by
cutting off the chief actors (as the Romans did) by banishing them the City, or by forcing
them to an accommadation upon such penalties as they shall be afraid to incur: of these
three ways the last is most dangerous, uncertain, and unprofitable, because it is impossible

where much blood has been shed, or much injury done, that that peace should last long,
which was made by compulsion; for seeing, and hearing, and conversing with one ano|ther
daily, their animosities must of necessity revive, and provoke them to new outrage,
by presenting them with new occasions of indignation and revenge: and of this we can|not
have an apter example than in the City of Pistoia, which 15 years since (as it is now)
was divided into the Panciatichi, and Cancellieri (only then they were at open defyance,
which now they are not.) After many contests and disputes among themselves, they pro|ceeded
to blood, to the plundering and demolishing one anothers houses, and committing
all other hostilities imaginable: The Florentines whose business it was to unite them, used
this third way, which rather encreased, than mitigated their tumults; so that weary of
that way, and grown wiser by experience, they made use of the second; banished some of
the Ring-leaders, and imprisoned the rest, whereby they not only quieted their differences
then, but have kept them so ever since. But doubtless the safest way had been to cut them
off at first, and if those executions were forborn then by us, or have been since by any
other Commonwealth, it is for no other cause, but that they require a certain generosity
and greatness of spirit, that in weak Commonwealths is hardly to be found. And these
are the errors, which as I said in the beginning, are committed by the Princes of our
times, when they are to determine in such great controversies; for they should inform
themselves how others have comported in the same cases before them; but they are so weak
by reason of the slightness of our present education, and their unexperience in History, that
they look upon the examples of the ancients as inhumane, or impossible: So that our mo|dern
opinions are as remote from the truth, as that saying of our wise men was upon a
time, Che bisognavatener Pistoiacon le parti,  Pisacon le fortezze: That Pistoia was to
be kept under by factions, and Pisa by a Citadel; but they were mistaken in both. What
my judgment is about Citadels, and such kind of Fortresses, I have delivered else|where;
so as in this place, I shall only demonstrate how unpracticable it is to keep Towns
in subjection by fomenting their differences and factions, and first it is impossible to keep
both parties true to you (be you Prince, or Commonwealth, or whatever) for men are
naturally so inconstant, it cannot be that those parties which favour you to day, should be
affected to you always; for they will still look out for some new Patron, and Protector:
so that by degrees one of the parties taking some disgust against you, the next War that
happens, you run a great hazard of losing your Town. If it be under the Government
of a State, the City is in more danger, than in the other case, because each party looks out
for friends among the great ones, and will spare no pains nor mony to corrupt them. From
whence two great inconveniences do arise: One is, you can never make them love you,
because by reason of the frequent alteration of Governors, and putting in sometimes a per|son
of one humour, and sometimes another of another; they can never be well govern'd
And then the other is, by this fomenting of Factions, your State must be necessarily divi|ded.
Blondus speaking of the passages betwixt the Florentines and Pistoians, confirms
what we have said in these words, Mentreche i Florentini disgnavano de riunir Pistoia, divi|sono
se Medesimi. Whilst the Florentines thought to have united the Pistoians, they divided
themselves. In the year 1501. Arezzo revolted from the Florentines, and the Valleys di
Tenere, and Chiana were entirely over-run by the Vitelli, and Duke Valentine. Whereupon
Monsieur de Lant was sent from the King of France to see all that they had lost, restored to
the Florentines. Wherever Monsieur de Lant came observing the persons that came to visit
him, did still profess themselves of the party of Morzocco, he was much dissatisfied with
their factions, and more that they should declare themselves so freely; for (said he) if in
France any man should pronounce himself of the King's party, he would be sure to be
punished, because it would imply that there was a party against the King, and it was his
Masters desire, that his Kingdom and Cities should be all of a mind: If therefore a Prince
believes there is no way for him to keep his Towns in obedience, but by keeping up Fa|ctions,
it is a certain argument of his weakness; for being unable by force and courage to
keep them under, he betakes himself to these pernicious arts; which in peaceable times
may palliate a little, but when troubles, and adversity come will assuredly deceive him.



CHAP. XXVIII.
A strict eye is to be kept upon the Citizens, for many times under pretence of Of|ficiousness, and Piety, there is hid a principle of Tyranny.
The City of Rome being distressed for want of provisions, and the publick stores be|ing
unable to supply it, it came into the thoughts of Spurius Melius (a rich Citizen of
those times) to furnish the Common people gratis out of his own private stock, whereby he
wrought himself so far into the favour of the people, that the Senate suspecting the ill con|sequences
of his bounty, began to conspire his destruction before his interest became too
great, to which purpose they created a Dictator, who put him to death: from whence it
may be observed, that many times those actions which seem charitable and pious at first
sight, and are not reasonable to be condemned, are notwithstanding cruel and dangerous
for a State, if not corrected in time. To make this more clear, I say a Commonwealth
cannot be well governed, nor indeed subsist without the assistance and ministry of power|ful
and great men: and yet on the other side that power and reputation of particular Ci|tizens
is the occasion of tyranny. To regulate this inconvenience, it is necessary, that see|ing
there must be great men, things should be so ordered that they may have praise and
reputation by such things as are rather useful than prejudicial to the State. Wherefore it
is carefully to be observed what ways they take to acquire their reputation; and they are
usually two, either publick or private. The publick way is when they arrive at their re|putation
by some good counsel, or some great exploit which they have atchieved for the
benefit of the publick: and this way of reputation is not only not to be precluded to the
Citizens, but to be opened by such promises of reward for their good counsels or actions
as may both dignify and inrich them; and when a reputation is gained by these plain and
sincere ways, it is never to be feared. But when their courses are private, (which is the
other of the two ways) they are dangerous, nay totally pernitious. Those private ways
are by obliging particular persons, by lending them mony, by marrying their relations, by
defending them against the Magistrates and doing several other particular favours which
may encourage their Clients to violate the Laws, and vitiate the Commonwealth; for
which cause it ought to be so well fortified with good Laws, that the endeavors of such
ambitious men may be either discouraged or defeated; and on the other side rewards pro|posed
to such as arrive at their greatness by any extraordinary exploit. In Rome the highest
reward of those persons who behaved themselves gloriously for the good of their Country,
was a triumph besides which they had other inferior honours, for more inferior services, 
to restrain or punish the ambition of those who went about by private and clandestine ways
to disturb the peace of their Country, their greatest remedy was to accuse them to the
people, and when those accusations were insufficient, (the people being blinded by some
specious pretence of benefit and advantage) they created a Dictator, who with a kind of
regal authority was to reduce the delinquent from his aberrations, or punish him as he
did Spurius Melius; and the leaving of one such fault unpunished, is enough to ruine a
Commonwealth, for a single example afterwards will hardly be effectual.


CHAP. XXIX.
That the transgressions of the people do spring commonly from the Prince.
PRinces cannot reasonably complain of the transgressions of their subjects, because it is
necessarily their negligence, or ill example that debauches them: and if the people of
our times are infamous for thefts, and robberies, and plundering, and such kind of enor|mities,
it proceeds from the exorbitance and rapacity of their Governors. Romania (be|fore
Pope Alexander VI exterminated those Lords who had the command in those parts)
was a place of all kind of dissoluteness and iniquity, every day, and every trivial occasion
producing notorious murders and rapines; which was not so much from any depravity in
the nature of the people, (as some persons would have it) as from the corruption of their
Princes; for being poor of themselves, and yet ambitious to live in splendor and magni|ficence,
they were forced upon ill courses, and indeed refused none that could supply them.

To pass by several others, one of their detestable ways was to make Laws against such and
such things, which after they were published, they themselves would be the first that should
break, to encourage others to do the same; nor was any man ever punished for his inob|servance,
till they saw enough involved in the same premunire; then (forsooth) the Laws
were executed most strictly, not out of any true zeal to justice, but out of a desire to be
fingring the Fines; from whence it followed, that by grievous mulcts and expilations the
people being impoverished, were constrained to use the same violences upon those who were
less potent than they; by which means men were not so much corrected, as instructed to
do ill; and all these mischiefs proceeded from the iniquity of their Princes. Livy has a
story to this purpose, where he tells us, that the Roman Embassadors (passing with a great
present to Apollo, which was taken out of the spoils of the Venetians) were taken by the Cor|sairs
of Lipari in Sicily, and carried with it into that Island. Timasitheus Prince of that
Town understanding what the Present was; whither it was going, and from whom it
was sent, (though born at Lipari) behaved himself in that like a Roman, and remonstra|ted
to the people the impiety of the fact, which he prest upon them so home, that by com|mon
consent the Present was restored, and the Embassadors dismissed; the words of the
Historian are these, Timasitheus multitudinem religione implevit, quae semper regenti est simi|lis:
which agrees with that saying of Lorenzo de i Medici.
Et quel che fa li Signor fanno poi molti,
Che nel Signor son tuttigl' occhi volti.
A Prince does nought (or regular, or rude,)
But's followed straight by th'gaping multitude.


CHAP. XXX.
A Citizen who would do any great matter by his own authority, must first extin|guish
all envy. In what manner things are to be ordered upon the approach of
an enemy, and how a City is to be defended.
THe Senate of Rome having intelligence that the Tuscans had made new levies of men
to make a new inroad into their Country; and that the Latini and Hernici (formerly
in amity with the Romans) had confederated with the Volsci, (implacable enemies to the
very name of a Roman) they concluded that War would be dangerous. Camillus being
Tribune at that time, and invested with Consular authority, they thought he would be
able to defend them, (without creating a Dictator) if the rest of his Colleagues would
intrust him with the chief Command; to which they readily condescended, Nec quicquam
(says Livy) de majestate su detractum credebant, quod Majestati ejus concessissent; Nor did
they think any thing substracted from their authority that was added to his. Upon which
Camillus (taking their paroles for their obedience) caused three Armies to be raised. The
first he designed against the Tuscans, and commanded it himself. The second was to con|tinue
about Rome to attend the motions of the Latiny and Hernici, and was commanded by
Quintus Servilius. The third was left in the City, as Guards for the security of the
Gates, and the Court, and to be ready upon any accident that should arise, and the Com|mand
of this Army was committed to Lucius Quintius. The care of his Magazines was
refer'd to Horatius one of his Colleagues, who was to see them furnished with such arms
and provisions, and other things as were necessary in times of War. He caused another
Tribune of his Colleagues (called Cornelius) to preside in the Senate, and publick Coun|sel,
that he might be present in all their debates,, and ready to advise in all their daily
transactions. So excellent were the Tribunes in those times, that when the safety of their
Country was at stake, they were equally disposed either to command or obey. And here
may be observed the great ability which a wise and good man has to do good, by the sup|pression
of envy, which is many times a great impediment to the good which some persons
would do, could they but get up into such authority as is requisite in affairs of importance.
This envy is extinguished two ways; either by some great and difficult accident, in which
every man forseeing his own ruine, lays his ambition aside, and submits himself volunta|rily
to the obedience of some person from whose virtue he may hope to be delivered: such
a person was this Camillus, who having been three times Dictator, and acted in all his ad|ministrations
more for the good of the publick, than any benefit of his own, and given

many excellent testimonies of his integrity and conduct besides, his Colleagues were not
scrupulous to transfer their authority, nor the people at all apprehensive of his greatness,
nor any (how great soever) ashamed to be inferior to him.
Wherefore it was not without reason that Livy used that expression, Nec quicquain, c.
The other way of extinguishing envy, is, when either by violence, or the course of na|ture
your competitors die; that is, such persons as envying your reputation and grandeur,
and disdaining that you should be above them, cannot contain themselves, and be quiet,
but rather than not satisfy the perversity of their minds, will be contented their Country
should be ruined, especially if they have been brought up in a corrupt State, and not been
meliorated by their education.
Against this sort of envy there is no remedy but in the death of the Subject. And
when an excellent person is so happy as to have these impediments removed by the course
of nature, without any machination or concurrence of his, he becomes great and honoura|ble
without obstacle, and may exercise his virtues without any offence. But when he has
not this good fortune, and nature is so unkind as to suffer them to live, it is necessary he re|move
them some extraordinary way, and make it his whole business to find one; yet with
that caution and deliberation, that he be sure his way be practicable before he ventures up|on
it. He who reads the Bible soberly, and consideratly, will find Moses (for the promo|tion
and establishment of his Laws) was forced to put several to death, for no other rea|son
but because out of envy they opposed his designs: and this necessity of removing Com|petitors
was not unknown to Girolamo Savonarola the Frier, and Pietro Soderini Gonsaloniere
of Florence. The Frier could not Master it for want of authority; and those of his fol|lowers
who could have done it, had no true knowledge of his mind; yet that was not his
fault, for his Sermons were full of declamations against the wisdom of this World, and
invectives against the wise men, by whom he intended such envious persons as opposed his
Doctrines and Institutions. Soderini was in hopes by the goodness of his conversation,
and his beneficence to all people, that he should have been so fortunate as to have out-lived
and worn out the envy of his adversaries, seeing he was but young, and found new Clients
coming in daily to his party, whom his excellent deportment had drawn over. So that he
abstain'd from all kind of severity and violence, not considering that time is not to be lost;
that goodness is ineffectual; that fortune is changeable; and that envious persons are not
to be obliged by all the presents and good offices in the World, So that both these persons
were ruined at last, one of them because he had not authority enough to master the envy of
his adversaries; the other because he did not do it (though he had authority) in time.
The other thing remarkable in that Story, was, the order taken by Camillus for the safety
of Rome, both abroad and at home. And certainly it is not without reason that good Hi|storians
(as ours is) set down certain distinct and particular cases, that posterity may learn
upon such accidents in what manner to defend themselves: it is to be observed likewise,
that the most dangerous and unprofitable defence is that which is made by tumult and dis|order;
and this is apparent by that third Army which Camillus left as a Guard to the City,
which many would have thought unnecessary, because the Citizens were generally arm'd,
and martial; so that their needed no more than to have arm'd the rest upon occasion,
without troubling them with an Army. But Camillus (and any other wise man would
have done the same) was of another opinion; for a multitude is not to be trusted with
arms but in an orderly and regular way. For which reason, and according to which ex|ample,
he who has the Government of a Town, is above all things to avoid arming the
people in a confused and tumultuous way; but is rather to cull and select such as he dare
trust with arms, and such as he is satisfied will obey him, let him send or command them
wheresoever he pleases. The rest are to be required to keep at home, and every man look
to the defence of his own house. He who is besieged, and observes this course, may defend
himself well enough; he that does otherwise, does not follow the example of Camillus
and will hardly defend himself.



CHAP. XXXI.
Powerful States, and excellent Persons, retain the same mind and dignity in
all kind of conditions.
AMong the rest of the great actions and words which our Author commemorates, and
mentions as certain arguments of the great virtue and excellence of Camillus, in a
speech of his to his Souldiers, he brings him in with this expression; Nec mihi Dictatura
animos fecit, nec exilium ademit; I was neither elated with my Dictatorship, nor dejected with
my Banishment. From whence we may observe that great men are never discomposed; let
fortune vary as she pleases, let her advance them sometimes, and depress them at others,
they are in the same settlement and tranquillity, so quiet and firm in their minds, that every
man may see it's not in the power of fortune to disorder them; whereas pusillanimous and
mean spirited persons, inebriated with their good fortune, and attributing all to their own
virtue and good conduct, make themselves odious and insupportable to all that are about
them, and that arrogance exposes them to many revolutions, which coming upon them on
a sudden, do so terrifie and dismay them, that they run into the other extreme, and become
as abject and vile. Hence it is that in time of adversity such Princes think more of their
escape than defence, having made themselves uncapable of that by their ill management be|fore.
And as this diversity of temper is many times to be found in particular Persons, and
Princes; so it is incident to Commonwealths, as may be seen by the example of the Ro|mans
and Venetians. The first were never dejected by any ill fortune, nor transported by
any good; as appears by their defeat at the Battle of Cannas, and their Victory against An|tiochus:
their defeat at Cannas was the third which they had received, and for that reason
was very considerable; yet they were not so terrified, or cowed, as to commit any thing con|trary
to the old dignity of the Romans; for they resolved to continue the war; they raised
more forces; they refused to redeem their prisoners upon any new terms; and could not be
brought to make any overtures of Peace, either to Hanibal, or the Senate at Carthage;
but for want of others, they arm'd their old men, and their servants. and resolved wholly
upon war; for which obstinacy and refractoriness, when Hanno was told, he made a speech
to the Senate, and remonstrated how little they were to presume upon their Victory at
Cannas: we see then the Romans were not to be terrified or discouraged by any adversity
of fortune; we shall shew now how far they were on the other side from insulting in their
good. Antiochus, before he came to a Battel, sent Embassadors to Scipio to desire a Treaty:
Scipio sent him these Conditions, that he should return with his Army into Syria, and leave
the rest to the Romans. Autiochus thought that unreasonable, fought him, was beaten,
and afterwards sent Embassadors again to Scipio, with instructions to accept of whatever
terms the Conqueror should give: Scipio never thought of altering his first propositions,
though made before the Battel was won, but told them, Quod Romani si vincuntur, non
minuuntur animis, nec si vincunt insolescere solent; That  mans were never dejected by ill
forune, nor elated by good. The Venetians acted quite the other way, who having got a
little good fortune, (ascribing it to a wrong cause, as if it had proceeded from their own
power and virtue) had the insolence to call the King of France Son of St. Mark, and ta|king
a fancy that they should bring their Commonwealth to as great a condition of gran|deur
and power as the Romans, they despis'd the Church, and all the Princes of Italy be|sides.
Afterwards, when their fortune began to change, and they received a small defeat
at Vaila by the French; they lost their whole Empire in a day; part revolted, and part
they gave up themselves to the Pope, and King of Spain; and so much had they abandoned
themselves to fear and consternation, that they sent Embassadors to the Emperor to make
themselves his Tributaries, and writ poor and mean Letters to the Pope to move him to
compassion, and to this extremity of dejection they were brought in four days time, by
the loss but of one half of their Army; for the other of their Proveditory retreated, and
came off safe to Verona with more than 25000 horse and foot; so that had there been any
courage either in the Citizens or Senate, they might quickly have recruited, and shewn their
force again; and if they could not have conquered, they might at least have lost all with
more reputation, or possibly have brought the enemy to some honourable accord: but the
poorness of their spirit, and the illness of their military discipline took from them at one
time both their courage and state: and so it will be with whosoever follows the example
of the Venetians: for this insolence in good fortune, and dejection in bad, proceeds from
their manner of education; which if vain and idle, will make you so too; whereas if it
be otherwise, it will give you a better notion of the World, and teach you in both for|tunes
to behave your self with more moderation: and as this is true in single persons, so it is in

Commonwealths, which are good or bad according to their manner of living. We have
often said it before, and think it not amiss to repeat it again, that the foundation of all
Governments consists in their Military discipline; and that where that is defective, nei|ther
their Laws, nor any thing else can be good; for thorow the whole tract of this Hi|story,
it appears that there is a necessity your Militia should be good, and that cannot be
good, but by continual exercise, which you cannot be sure of unless it consists of your
own Subjects. and because you are not always in War, and it is impossible you shall be,
therefore it is necessary that they be exercised in times of Peace, which is not to be done by
any but your own Subjects, in respect of the charge.
Camillus (as is said before) marched out with his Army against the Tuscans, but his Sol|diers
having had a sight of the Enemy, found their Army so great, that they were discou|raged
and dismay'd, and thought themselves so much inferior, that they were not able
to fight the. Camillus understanding this terror in his Camp, went up and down among
the Soldiers, and having reprehended their fear, and said many things to encourage them,
and drive that fancy out of their heads, at last without further directions, Come (said he)
Courage! Quod quisque didicit aut consuevit, faciat. Do what you have been taught and
accustomed, I desire no more. From whence it may be collected that he would not have used
those words, had not his Army been exercised before, and that in times of Peace as well
as War: For no good is to be expected, nor no General to trust himself to an unexperi|enced
or undisciplined Army, which will certainly be his ruine, though he were as good
a Commander as Hanibal himself. And the reason is, because when an Army is engaged
the General cannot be present in all places, to supply all defects, and remedy all errors; so
that he must necessarily miscarry, unless he has such persons disposed up and down in the
Army, as are capable of understanding his mind, and executing his Orders. Which being
so, the Roman discipline is to be followed, and the Citizens of every City are to be inured
to their Arms in times of Peace as well as war, that when they are brought to fight, they
may not be at a loss, or meet with any thing new, or unaccustomed to them; by which
means it will come to pass, that they will not be surprized or terrified in any condition,
but retain still the same courage and sence of their dignity; But where the Citizens are
undisciplin'd, and rely more upon their fortune, than experience, their hearts will change
with their fortune, and they will give the same testimony of themselves, as the Venetians
have done.


CHAP. XXXII.
The ways which some people have taken to prevent a Peace.
THe Circei and the Velitrae two of the Roman Colonies, revolted, in hopes the Latine
would have been able to defend them. The Latines being defeated, and they frustra|ted
of their hopes, it was the advice of several Citizens, that they should send Embassa|dors
to Rome to reconcile themselves to the Senate; But those who had been ring-leaders
in the defection, apprehending the punishment would fall heavy upon their heads, per|verted
that design; and to run things beyond all possibility of Terms, they incited the
people to arm, and invade the Frontiers of the Romans. And doubtless when Prince or
Commonwealth are desirous to prevent an agreement, there is no safer, nor surer way,
than by running the people into some unpardonable offence, that the fear of being punish'd
may keep them averse from all overtures of Peace. After the first War betwixt the Car|thaginians
and Romans, those Soldiers which had been employed by the Carthaginians in
Sicily and Sardigna, as soon as the Peace was concluded, went over into Africa, where
being denyed or delayed in the demands of their pay, they took Arms, and putting them|selves
under the command of two of their Officers, Matho, and Spendio, they plundered
several of the Carthaginian Towns, and possessed themselves of others. The Carthagi|nians
(to try all ways, before they came to extremity) sent Asdrubal (on of their Prin|cipal
Citizens) Embassador to them; who having been formerly their General, it was
probable, might have some Authority among them. Asdrubal being arrived, and Matho,
and Spendio desirous to put the Soldiers beyond all possibility of pardon, persuaded them
that the best and most secure way would be, for them to kill all the Carthaginians that
were Prisoners with them, and Asdrubal among the rest. Whereupon they killed them
all, with a thousand circumstances of cruelty and torture; to which piece of wickedness
they added another by publishing an Edict importing, That all the Carthaginians which

should be taken for the future, should be treated the same way. And thus they prevented
all propositions of Peace, and rendered their Soldiers obstinate and implacable to the
Carthaginians.


CHAP. XXXIII.
To the obtaining a Victory, it is necessary your Army has a confidence not
only in one another, but in their General.
TO win a Battel, and overcome an Enemy, it is necessary to give your Army such a
confidence, as may make them believe that nothing is able to withstan them; and
the way of infusing this confidence is, by Arming, and exercising them well, and giving
them a knowledge and acquaintance one with the other; which confidence and acquain|tance
is not to be expected, but where your Soldiers are your own Subjects, and have been
brought up together. The General is to be so qualified, that the Soldiers may have confi|dence
in his Wisdom, and Conduct; and they will always have such a confidence if they
see him careful, and regular, and couragious, and one who preserves the majesty of his
command with discretion and reputation; which he will do, if he punishes strictly, and
put his Soldiers upon no over-hard and impertinent duty; keeps his promises; represent
victory easie, either by concealing or extenuating the dangers, or by encouraging them
bravely against them; and these things rightly observed, are of great consequence both to
the Authority of the General, and the obtaining the Victory. The way which the Ro|mans
took to give this assurance to their Armies, was, by pretence of Religion; for
which cause before the creation of their Consuls; the raising, or marching, or engaging
of their Armies, their Augures and Auspices were consulted: and without some of these,
no wise General would undertake any great Enterprize, believing they should certainly
miscarry, unless the Soldiers were thorowly convinced that the Gods were on their side.
And when any of their Consuls or other Commanders fought in defiance of these Auspi|ces,
he was punished, as Claudius Pulcher for despising the Omen of the Chickens. And
although this is obvious in every part of the Roman History; yet it is better prov'd by the
complaint of Appius Claudius to the people, against the insolence of their Tribunes,
where he tells them that by their means, the Auspices, and other religious Customs were
neglected or corrupted, His words are these, Eludant nunc licet Religionem; quid enim
interest si pulli non pascentur, si ex cavea tardirts exierint, succinuerit avis? Parvasunt haec,
sed parvaista non contemnendo, Majores nostri maximam hanc Rempublicam fecerunt. Let
them laugh at Religion as they please, and cry, what are we concerned if the Pullets won't eat,
if they come lazily out of their Penns; or if a bird be disposed to sing? 'Tis true they are but
trifles, yet by not dispising those trifles, our Ancestors brought this Commonwealth to the Gran|deur
it is at. And it was true; for those little things were sufficient to keep the Soldiers
confident and united, which are two things go very far in a Victory, though without vir|ture
and valour, they are not always successful. The Prenestini being in the Field with their
Army against the Romans, they went and lodged themselves upon the River Allia (in a
place where the Romans had been beaten by the French) that the consideration of the
place might be an encouragement to their own men, and a terror to the Romans. And
though this design was not improbable for the reason abovesaid, yet it apeared by the
success, that true courage is not disturbed by every little accident, as was well expressed by
the Dictator to his Master of the House, Vides tu, fortuna illos fretos, ad Alliam consedisse,
at tu fretus armis, animis invade mediam acien. You see, by their posting themselves
upon the Allia, they rely wholly upon Fortune; do you trust to your Arms, end your courage
and attack their main Battel. And he was in the right; for true courage, good discipline,
and a confidence arising from so many Victories, cannot be discomposed by such frivolous
stratagems; light things will not dismay them, nor every disorder distract them. For
even in the absence of their Officers, Soldiers that are expert, and accustomed to Arms,
are not easily beaten. As appeared by the two Manlii (both Consuls, and making War
upon the Volsci) who having indiscreetly sent part of their Army to forrage, it fell out,
that both the commanded party, and those which were left behind, were encompassed by
the Enemy, and as it were besieged both at a time, out of which danger the Soldiers
were delivered, more by their own courage, than any conduct in the Consuls; whereupon
Livy tells us Militum, etiam sine Rectore stabilis virtus tutata est. The stedfast courage of
the Soldiers defended them, without any help from their General. Fabius had likewise an

excellent way to confirm his Soldiers and possess them with a confidence, which I cannot
omit: Having invaded Tuscany with a new Army; supposing the novelty of the Coun|try,
and their inexperience of that Enemy might have some influence among them, to give
them a confidence, he called them together before the Battel, and having in a grave Ora|tion
given several reasons why they might hope for the Victory, he told them, That he
had another reason behind, more certain than all of them, but in that he must be
private; for to discover it, would be to defeat it: A wise way, and deserves well
to be imitated.


CHAP. XXXIV.
What vogue, fame or opinion disposes the people first to favour some parti|cular
Citizen; and whether they, or a Prince distributes their Offices with
most prudence and judgment.
WE have shown before, how Titus Manlius (called afterwards Torquatus) preserved
his Father L. Manlius from an accusation which Pomponius the Tribune had ex|hibited
against him to the people. And although the way which he took to preserve him
was violent and irregular; yet his filial affection to his Father was so grateful to the peo|ple,
that they not only not reprehended him for what he had done, but advanced him to
honour; for being not long after to choose Tribunes for their Legions, T. Manlius was
the second that was made. And here I think it not amiss to consider the way which the
the people of Rome took in the distribution of their honours, and election of Magi|strates;
and to inquire into the truth of what I asserted before, That the distributions
of the people are better, and more exact than the distributions of a Prince; for the
people follow the common and publick character of every man, unless by some particular
notion of his actions, they presume, or believe otherwise. There are three ways by
which a man may gain esteem and reputation with the people. The first is by extraction,
when the Parents having been great men, and serviceable to the Commonwealth, the
people take a fancy that their Children must of necessity be the same, until by some ill
act they convince them of the contrary. The second way is to associate with grave per|sons,
of good esteem, and such as are reputed discreet and sober by every body; and be|cause
nothing indicates and discovers a man so much as the Company which he keeps;
he who keeps good Company, may be concluded to be good; for of necessity persons so
conversant together, must have something of similitude. But their is another way of
gaining the favour of the people, which exceeds them both; and that is by performing
some extraordinary action, whether publick or private, it matters not, so you come ho|nourably
off. And the judgments which are made in this case, are much better than the
other: For the arguments taken from the virtue of the Parents, are doubtful and fallacious;
nor can any man conclude any thing, till experience resolves him. The presumptions in
the second from their conversations and Company, are much better than the first, but
not comparable to the third; for reputation from Ancestors or Company depends bare|ly
upon opinion, and hopes, till some great action be performed that testifies your vir|tue,
and determines the doubt; and then if this action be performed when you are young,
it makes the impression much deeper, and so fixes your reputation, that you must commit
many ill actions before you can expunge it: Those therefore who would advance them|selves
in a Commonwealth, are to take this course, and endeavour to do some remarkable
thing at first; which was done at Rome very frequently by several young persons, either
by the promulgation of some Law for the benefit of the publick; or by the accusation of
some great person for transgressing the Law; or doing some other great or new thing that
may make you be talk'd of. Nor are these things necessary only to recommend you at
first; but they are necessary likewise to maintain and augment your reputation; so that
they are to be renewed and repeated often as long as you live; as Manlius did; for after
he had defended his Father so honourably, and by that noble action laid the foundation of
his esteem, many years were not past before he fought singly with a French man, and
having slain him very bravely, he took a Gold Chain from his neck, which gave him the
name of Torquatus; and having given these testimonies of his courage in his youth, when
he came to riper years he made himself as famous for discipline and justice by the exam|ple
upon his Son, whom he caused to be put to death for fighting contrary to Orders,
though he defeated the Enemy; which three great instances of his courage and virtue,

made his name so honourable both then and ever since, that no Victory, no Triumph
could have done more. And good reason, for in victories, many equalled, and some
exceeded him; but in these three very few came near, but no body exceeded him.
Scipio the elder was not so glorious by all his triumphs, as for having in his youth so
manfully defended his Father at the Battel upon the Tesin; and after the Battel of Cannas
forced certain young Romans with his Sword drawn to take an Oath not to desert their
Country as they had resolved to do before; which two actions were the foundations of his
following reputation, and served as steps to his Triumphs both over Spain and Africa
which favour and good opinion of him was highly encreased, by his returning a Daughter
and a Wife (both of them great Beauties, and both of them his Prisoners) immaculate
and untouched, one to her Father, and the other to her Husband, in his Wars in Spain.
And this way of proceeding is not only necessary for such as would gain honour and pro|motion
in a Commonwealth; but for Princes likewise and Kings who are desirous to retain
their reputation with their subjects. For nothing recommends a Prince more efficaciously
to the people, than in his youth to give them some taste or specimen of his virtue, by some
remarkable act, or proposal for the benefit of the publick; especially if it has any tendancy
to justice, magnanimity,, liberality, or the like; for things of that nature that are extra|ordinary,
whether acted, or spoken, are transmitted to posterity with so much reverence,
that they even come to be Proverbs among the people: But to return, I say then, when the
people designs to confer honour upon a Citizen, upon one of these three accounts, they go
upon very good grounds, but especially upon the last, when several and reiterated exam|ples
make him more known; for then 'tis not possible they should be deceived, and in
young persons they are certain presages of their deportment for the future. I speak only
of those degrees which are given at first, before any firm experience has made them better
known, or that they pass from one action to a contrary, in which, both as to mistakes,
and corruption, the people do not erre so often as Princes. And because it may happen
that the people may be deceived by report or opinion, or perhaps the actions of a man, as
believing them more considerable and estimable than they are (which cannot easily hap|pen
to a Prince, by reason of his Council which are by, and always ready to inform him)
that the people may not want such Monitors; those who have laid right foundations for a
Commonwealth, have provided that when the great and supream Offices of a City are
to be supplyed, where it would be dangerous to entertain any incapable persons, if they
find the people disposed to the creation of any man who is known to be improper, it
may be lawful for any Citizen; nay, an honour to any one that shall publickly discover his
defects, that thereby the people understanding him better, may be better able to choose.
That this was the practice in Rome appears by the Oration of Fabius Maximus, which he
made publickly to the people in the second Punick War, when at the creation of the Con|suls,
the people were inclined to create T. Ottacilius, whom Fabius conceiving an unfit
man for those times, remonstrated his thoughts so effectually to them, that he put him by
that degree, and prevailed with the people to give it another person that deserv'd it much
better. Which being so, the people in the election of their Magistrates do judge according
to the best and truest tokens that they can observe; and could they be as well counselled in
these affairs as Princes, they would commit fewer errors than they do. So that that Citi|zen
who would work himself into the favour of the people, must do some great matter, or
express some great instance of his virtue or parts, that he may seem to imitate Manlius, and
get as much honour as he.


CHAP. XXXV.
What dangers they incur, who make themselves authors of any Enterprise, and
the more extraordinary the design, the greater the danger.
IT would be too long, and difficult a task to discourse at large of the danger there is
in being the head in any new enterprise; what hazards there are in the Conduct, and
how impossible to maintain it. Reserving that therefore for a more convenient place; I
shall speak here only of the dangers to which such Citizens, or other persons are subject
who advise a prince to make himself head of any important design, and do it with that
eagerness and impetuosity, that the whole enterprise may be imputed to him. The first
thing I would recommend to their observation is, that Counsels are commonly judged by
their success; if their success be unfortunate, the whole scandal of the miscarriage falls

upon the author. If it prospers, and the event be good, he is commended, but at a di|stance,
and his reward is not commensurate with the danger. The present Emperor of
the Turks Sultan Selimus (as it is reported by some that came late out of that Country)
having made great preparations for an Expedition into Syria and Egypt changed his design
upon the persuasion of one of his Bassa's, and with a vast Army march'd against the Sophie
of Persia. Arriving in an open and rge Country, but for the most part Desarts and dry
and no Rivers to supply them, many Diseases were contracted in his Army, insomuch as
with hunger and sickness, it dwindled away (as many of the Romans had done in that
Country before) till at last (though he had the better of the War) he had lost most of his
men; upon which the Emperor being highly enraged, caused the Bassa who had coun|selled
him thither to be slain. We read likewise of several Citizens advising and Enter|prize,
upon the miscarriage of which they were all of them banished. At Rome certain
Citizens proposed and promoted very earnestly the making one of the Consuls out of the
people, and having prevailed, the first of them which went out with their Army being
beaten and over-thrown, the authors would doubtless have found the inconvenience of
their Counsel, had not the people (in whose favour it was given) appeared in their pro|tection.
So that this is most certain, all Counsellors of this kind (whether to Princes or
Commonwealths) are betwixt those two rocks; if they do not advise what in their judg|ments
they think profitable for their Masters, and that frankly and without respect, they
fail in their duties, and are defective that way; again if they do counsel freely, they
bring their lives and fortunes in danger, because such is the natural blindness of Mankind,
they cannot judge of the goodness or badness of any thing, but by the success; and con|sidering
with my self, what way was most likely to avoid this infamy or danger, I can
find no better than to take all things moderately, to assume and impropriate no enterprize;
to deliver your opinion frankly, but without passion, and to defend it so modestly, that if
it be followed by your Prince or Commonwealth, it may appear to be their voluntary
act, and not done upon your importunity; in that case it will not be reasonable to com|plain
of your Counsel, when executed by the concurrence of the rest; for if there be any
danger, it is where things are done in contradiction of the rest of the Counsel, who upon
any miscarriage will be sure to combine against you, and procure your destruction: and
though perhaps in this case there may want something of that glory which accrews to a
single person, who carries a design against the opposition of the rest, especially if it suc|ceeds;
yet there are two advantages on your side; for first you will not run so great a
hazard in the miscarriage, and then if you advise a thing modestly, which by the obstinacy
and contradiction of the rest is carried against you, the miscarriage of their Counsel, will
make much more to your reputation. And although a good Citizen is not to desire to raise
his credit upon the misfortunes of his Country, nor indeed to rejoyce in what happens of
it self; yet when a thing is done, it is more satisfaction to have your Counsel applauded,
than to be in danger of being punished. Wherefore I am of opinion, in these doubtful
and difficult cases, there can be no better way for the Counsel either of a Prince or State,
than to deliver themselves modestly and freely; for to be sullen and say nothing, would
not only betray your Country, but expose your self, because in time you would become
suspected; and perhaps it might befal them as it did to one of the Counsel of Perseus
King of Macedon, who being defeated by Emilius Paulius, and escaping with some few of
his friends, one of them (in discourse of his Master's misfortune) began to find fault; and
blame several passages in his Conduct, which as he pretended might have been managed
much better. At which the King being inraged, turn'd to him, told him, And do you
(like a Traytor as you are) tell me of it now, when 'tis past remedy? and killed him with
his own hands; so that he pay'd dear for being silent, when it was his duty to have spoke,
and for speaking when it was discretion to have been silent; nor did his forbearing to give
his advice secure him from danger; so that I am confirmed in my opinion that the best
way is to observe the directions above said.



CHAP. XXXIV.
The reason why at the first Charge, the French have been, and still are
accounted more than Men, but afterwards less than Women.
THe arrogance of that French man who challenged the stoutest of the Romans to fight
with him upon the Bridge of the Arrien, and was afterwards killed by T. Manlius
Torquatus, puts me in mind of what Livy says in many places, of the French, that in their
first attack they are more fierce and daring than men, but afterwards more fearful and pusil|lanimous
than Women. And many people enquiring into the cause, do attribute it to the
peculiarity of their temperature and nature: I am of opinion that there is much of that
in it; yet I cannot think but that Nature which makes them so furious at first, may be so
invigorated and improved by art, as to continue their courage to the last. To prove my
opinion, I do affirm there are three sorts of Armies. In the first there is courage and fury,
joyn'd with order and discipline; and indeed their courage and fury proceeds from their
discipline. And of this sort were the Armies of the Romans, for all Histories do agree
that there was always good order by reason of their long discipline and experience. No|thing
was done in their Armies, but with great regularity, and express order from their
General. They neither eat, nor slept, nor bought, nor sold, nor did any other action
either military or civil, but by permission of the Consul; and therefore these Roman Ar|mies,
who by their discipline and courage subdued the whole world, are the best example
we can follow; they who do otherwise, do ill, and though perhaps they may do some|thing
extraordinary sometimes, yet 'tis more by accident than judgment: But where well
ordered courage meets with good discipline, and is accommodated to the circumstances of
manner, and time, nothing dismays them, nothing withstands them; for the goodness of
their order giving new life and courage to their men, makes them confident of Victory, and
that confidence never suffers them to give ground, till their whole order be broken. There
is another sort of Armies which are acted more by fury than discipline (as in the Armies
of the French) and there it is quite otherwise, because not succeeding in their first charge,
and not being sustained by a well ordered courage, that fury upon which they wholly rely'd
growing cold and remiss, they are quickly overthrown. Whereas the Romans fearing
nothing of danger, by reason of their good order and discipline, without the least diffi|dence
or question of the Victory, fought on still obstinately, being animated with the same
courage, and agitated by the same ardor at last as at first, and the more they were press'd,
the better they resisted. The third sort of Armies is where their is neither natural cou|rage,
nor discipline and order, as in our Italian Armies now adays, which are so useless
and unserviceable, that ess they light upon an Enemy who runs by some accident, they
are never like to have a Victory; and this is so obvious every day, it needs no example to
prove it. But because by the testimony of Livy every one may know what is the right
discipline, and what is the wrong, I will give you the words of Papirius Gursor in his
reprimande to Fabius the Master of his Horse. His words are these, Nemo hominum; nemo
Deorum verecundiam hebeat. Non edicta Imperatorum, non auspicia observentur: Sine Com|meatu,
vagimilites in pacato, in hostico errent; immemores Sacramenti, se ubi valent exau|ctorentur;
infrequentia deserantur signa; ne conveniatur ad edictum: nec discernatur
interdiu, noctu; aequo, iniquo loco, jussu, injussu Imperatoris pugnetur; Non signa, non
ordines serventur? latrocinii modo, caeca  fortuita, pro solenni  sacrata Militia, sit.
Let them bare no respect or reverence either to God or man: Let neither the orders of the
General, nor the directions of the Auspices be observed; Let the loose and vagabond Soldier
infest his own Country as much as the Enemies: Let them forget their Oaths, and disband as
they please: Let them run from their Colours as they think good, and not come back when
they are required: Let them fight hand over head, without consideration of time, or place, or
order of their Officers: Let their ranks be confused, and their Colours deserted: In a word,
Let their whole Conduct be blind and fortuito like thieves, rather than the solemn and
sacred Militia of the Romans. By this we may easily see whether the Militia of our times
be blind and fortuitous or whether it be solemn, and sacred, how far is it short of the
old discipline of the Romans, which consisting in exact order, produced courage and con|stancy
in the Souldiers; and how far behind the French, among whom though their is
not that just order and constancy, yet there is courage enough.



CHAP. XXXVII.
Whether fighting in small parties, or pickeering before a Battel be necessary;
and how the temper of a new Enemy is to be found without them.
IN humane affairs (as we have said before) there is not only a perpetual and unavoidable
difficulty in carrying them to their perfection, but there is always some concomitant mis|chief
so inseparable from it, that it is impossible to arrive at the one without the other. This
is visible in all the actions of mankind, so that that perfection is acquir'd with much dif|ficulty,
unless you be so favoured by fortune, that by her force she overcomes that com|mon
and natural inconvenience: and of this, and duel betwixt Manlius Torquatus and the
French-man put me in mind, where, as Livy tell us, Tantiea dimicatio ad universi belli e|ventum
momenti fuit, ut Gallorum exercitus, relictis trepid Castris, in Tiburtem agrum, mox
in Campaniam transierit; The success of that duel was of so much importance to the success
of the War, that thereupon the French Army drew off in a great fear into the Tiburtine Coun|try,
and afterwards march'd away into Campania. From whence I infer, on the one side,
that a good General is to avoid any thing that (carrying but small advantage with it) may
have an ill influence upon his Army; to fight therefore in parties, and venture your whole
fortune upon less than your whole Army, is rash and imprudent, (as I have said before, where
I dissuaded the keeping of passes.) On the other side, I observe, when an experienced
General comes against a new enemy that has the reputation of being stout, before he brings
him to a Battel, he is obliged to try him by slight skirmishes and pickeerings, that by so
doing he may bring his Souldiers acquainted with their discipline, and way of sighting,
and remove that terror, which the fame and reputation of their courage had given them.
And this in a General is of very great importance, and so absolutely necessary, that he who
engages an unknown enemy with his whole Army, before he has made an essay of his
courage, runs himself and his Army into manifest danger. Valerius Corvinus was sent by
the Romans with an Army against the Samnites, a new enemy with whom they had never
had any conflict before; and Livy tells us he sent small parties abroad, and caused them to
entertain light skirmishes with the enemy, Ne eos novum bellum, ne novus hostis terreret;
Lest his Souldiers should be terrified with a new war, and a new enemy. But then the dan|ger
is, that your men being overcome, their terror should be encreased; and that which you
intended to animate, should discourage and dismay them: and this is one of those good
things which have so near a conjunction with evil, that 'tis no hard matter to take one for
the other. My advice therefore is, that a wise General abstains from any thing that may
strike a terror into his Army; for then the Souldiers begin to apprehend, when they see
their Comrades kill'd before their face. For which reason those pickeerings and slight
skirmishes are to be avoided by all means, unless upon great advantage, or some more than
ordinary hopes of success. Again, it is not his interest certainly to defend any pass, where
he cannot upon occasion bring his whole Army to engage: neither are any Towns to be
made good, but such as are of importance to the subsistance of his Army, and without
which both that and himself must be ruined; and no such Towns are to be fortified, but
where not only a good Garison may be disposed and supplyed, but where in case of a
Siege your whole Army may be brought to relieve it: other Towns are rather to be quit|ted
than kept; for to abandon a Town whilst your Army is in the field, is no disrepute to
you, nor discouragement to your Souldiers: but when you lose a place that you undertook,
and every body expected you would defend, that abates much of your credit, and is a
great prejudice to you; so that it will be with you as it was then with the French, a trifling
loss will endanger the whole war.
Philip of Macedon (the Father of Perseus) a martial Prince, and of great reputation in
his time, being invaded by the Romans, quitted and destroyed a great part of his Country,
which he supposed he should be unable to defend, as judging it better, and more con|sistent
with his honour to suffer it to be possessed by the enemy as waste and neg|lected,
than to undertake, and not be able to defend it. The affairs of the Romans being in
a very ill condition after the battel at Cannas, they refused their assistance to several of their
friends and allies, giving them leave to defend themselves if they could: which resolutions
are much better than to attempt to defend that which is not in our power; for in the first
case we lose only our friends; but in the last, both our friends and our selves. To re|turn
therefore to our skirmishes, I say, that when ever for the discovery of the enemy, or
acquainting his Souldiers with the way of their sighting, a General is constrained to make
use of them, he is to do it with that art and advantage, that he may run no hazard of being
worsted: or else to follow the example of Marius, (which is the better way of the two)

who marching against the Cimbri, a fierce and numerous people which had invaded Italy
for prey, and beaten one Roman Army already; observing his Army to be afraid, he
thought it would be necessary before he came to a general engagement, to contrive some
way or other to dispossess them of their fear; whereupon, as a wise Officer, he disposed
his Army (more than once or twice) in some secure place upon the road by which the Cim|brian
Army was to pass, from whence his men might have a view of their march, and ac|custom
themselves to the sight of them; to the end that seeing them to be nothing but a
confused and disorderly multitude, incommoded with baggage, and either very ill accoutred,
or utterly unarm'd, they might recover their spirits, and grow impatient to be at them:
and this prudent invention of Marius ought to be diligently imitated by other people, lest
they fall into the dangers aforesaid, and come off like the French, Qui obrem parvi ponde|ris
in Tiburtem agrum,  in Campaniam transierunt; Who upon a trifling accident, desponded,
and retired: And because I have mentioned Valerius Corvinus in this Chapter, I shall
make use of his words in the next, to shew how a General should be qualified.


CHAP. XXXVIII.
How a Generalis to be qualified, that his Army may rely upon him.
AS we have said before, Valerius Corvinus was gone with his Army against the Sam|nites,
a new enemy, with whom the Romans had had no contest before. To en|courage
his Souldiers, and acquaint them with the discipline of the Samnites, he inured his
men to them, by several small skirmishes, but lest that should not do, he made a speech to
them before the Battel, remonstrating with all possible efficacy of words, how little they
were to value the enemy; and how much they might expect from their own valour, and
his conduct: Livy brings him in with these words in his mouth, which gives us an exact
character of a General in whom his Army may confide. Tum etiam intueri cujus ductu
auspicioque ineunda pugna sit; utrum qui audiendus, duntaxat magnificus adhortator sit, ver|bis
tantum ferox, operum militarium expers; aut qui  ipse tela tractare, procedere ante signa,
versari media in mole pugnae sciat. Facta ma, non dicta vos milites sequi volo, nec discipli|nam
modo, sed exemplum etiam ame petere, qui hac dextra mihi tres Consulatus, summam|que
laudem peperi; Then you may see under whose Conduct you fight; whether he that speaks
to you be only a magnificent boaster, valiant in words, but ignorant in whatever belongs to a
Souldier; or whether he be one that knows how to manage his Arms, lead up his Men, charge
in the head of them, and behave himself manfully in the very heat of the Battel; I would not
(fellow Souldiers) that you should follow my words more than my deeds; or take only my pre|cepts,
and not my example, who with this hand have gained three Consulships, and im|mortal
reputation. Which words, if well considered, are sufficient to instruct any
man what course he is to take to make himself reputed a great General; he who acts
otherwise will find in time that that command (however he came by it, whether by ambi|tion
or fortune) will rather abstract than add to his honour, for it is not titles that
make men honourable, but men their titles: and it is to be observed likewise, that if great
Captains have been forced to such unusual language to confirm the hearts of an old veteran
Army, when it is to fight with a new enemy; how much more care and art is to be used in
a new inexperienced Army, that never saw an enemy before. For if a strange enemy be
terrible to an old Army, well may he be so to an Army that is new raised, and was never
engaged: nevertheless all these difficulties have been overcome by the prudence of several
Captains, as by Gracchus the Roman, and Epaminondas the Theban, who with new raised
men defeated old veteran Troops, that had been long experienced in matters of war; and
their way was to prepare them for some months by continual exercise, and counterfeit bat|tels;
by using them to their ranks, and holding them to strict discipline and obedience;
after which, they advanced against the enemy, engaged with great confidence, and per|formed
very well. Let no man therefore (that is any thing of a Souldier) despair of ma|king
his Army good, if he has but men enough; for that Prince who abounds with men,
and wants Souldiers, is rather to complain of his own laziness and imprudence, than of
their incapacity and dulness.



CHAP. XXXIX.
A General ought to know the Country, and how to take his advantage
in the ground.
AMong the many things that are necessary in a General of an Army, the knowledg of
Coasts and Countries is one, and that not only in a Generall, but in an exquisite and
more particular way, without which he shall not be able to do any great thing: and be|cause
all knowledge requires use and exercise to bring it to perfection, so is it in this know|ledg
of places; and if it be enquired what use, and what exercise is required in this case,
I answer, Hunting, and Hawking, and such like recreations; and therefore it is that the
Heroes which anciently govern'd the World, were said to be brought up in woods and fo|rests,
and accustomed to those kind of exercises; for hunting (besides the acquaintance
which it gives you of the Country) instructs you in many things that are necessary in war;
Xenophon in the Life of Cyrus tells us, that when Cyrus went to invade the King of Ar|menia,
assigning several offices and places to the several parts of his Army, he told them
that, Questa, non era altro ch'una di quelle caccie le quali molte volte havenano fatte seco;
That this expedition was no more than one of those Chaces which they had taken frequently
with him. Those whom he placed as Scouts upon the Mountains, he resembled to them
who set their nets upon the hills; and those who were to make excursions upon the plain,
were like them who were employed to rouse the Deer, and force them into the Toyls. And
this is said by Xenophon, to shew the resemblance and similitude betwixt hunting and war:
for which cause those kind of exercises are not only honourable, but necessary for great
persons; and the rather, because nothing gives a man so true a knowledg of the Coun|try,
or imprints it more deeply and particularly in the memory: and when a man has ac|quainted
himself thorowly with one Country, he may arrive more easily at the knowledg
of other, because all Countries and Coasts have some kind of proportion and conformity
betwixt them; so that the knowledg of the one contributes much to the understanding of
the other. But if before you have acquainted your self with your own, you seek out new
Regions, you will hardly without great labour, and long time, come to the knowledg of
either. Whereas he that is well vers'd and practised in one, shall at the first cast of his eye
give you an account how that plain lies; how that mountain rises; and how far that val|ley
extends; and all by his former knowledg in that kind. To confirm all this, Titus
Livius gives us an example in Publius Decius, who being a military Tribune in the Army
which the Consul Cornelius commanded against the Samnites, and finding the said Consul
and Army fallen by accident into a Vale where they might have been encompassed by the
enemy, and cut off, Vides tu Aule Corneli (said Decius to the Consul) cacumn illud supra
hostem? Arx illa est spei salutis nostrae; si eam (quoniam caeci reliquere Samnites) im|pigre
capimus; Do you see, Sir, that hill which hangs over the enemies Camp; there lies our
hope; the blind Samnites haue neglected it, and our safety depends upon the seizing of it
quickly. For, said Livy before, Publius Decius Tribunus militum, unum editum in saltu
Collem, imminentem hostium Castris, aditu arduum impedito agmini, expeditis hand difficilem;
Publius Decius the military Tribune observed a hill over the enemies Camp not easily to be
ascended by those who were compleatly arm'd, but to those who were lightly arm'd, ac|cessible
enough. Whereupon being commanded to possess it by the Consul with 3000
men, he obeyed his orders, secur'd the Roman Army, and designing to march away in the
night, and save both himself and his party; Livy brings him in speaking these words to
some of his Comrades, Ite mecum, ut dum lucis aliquid superest, quibus locis hostes praesidia
ponant, qua pateat hinc exitus exploremus. Haec omnia sagulo militari amictus, ne Ducem
circuire hostes notarent, perlustravit; Come along with me, that whilst we have yet light, we
may explore where the enemy keeps his Guards, and which way we may make our retreat: and
this he did in the habit of a private Souldier, that the enemy might not suspect him for an Of|ficer.
He then who considers what has been said, will find how useful and necessary it is
for a General to be acquainted with the nature of the Country; for had not Decius un|derstood
those things very well, he could not so suddenly have discerned the advantage of
that hill, and of what importance it would be to the preservation of the Roman Army;
neither could he have judged at that distance whether it was accessible or not, and when
he had possessed himself of it, and was to draw off afterwards, and follow the Consul, (be|ing
so environed by the Samnites) he could never have found out the best way for his re|treat,
nor have guessed so well where the enemy kept his Guards. So that it must neces|sarily

be that Decius had a perfect knowledg of the Country, which knowledg made him
secure that hill, and the securing of that hill was the security of the Army. After which,
by the same knowledg (though he was as it were besieged by the enemy) he found a way
to make his own retreat, and bring off his whole party.


CHAP. XL.
How fraud in the management of War is honourable and glorious.
THough fraud in all other actions is abominable, yet in matters of War it is laudable
and glorious; and he who overcomes his enemies by stratagem, is as much to be
praised as he who overcomes him by force. This is to be seen by the judgment of those
who write the Lives of great Persons, especially of great Commanders; for they command
and applaud Hanibal and the rest in all their inventions of that nature. There are many
examples in them to this purpose, which I shall not repeat here; only this I must adver|tize,
that I do not intend that fraud which consists in betraying a trust, or breaking an a|greement,
to be honourable; for though by them you may acquire Power, and 'tis possible
a Kingdom, (yet, as I said before) it cannot be with honour; but by fraud, I mean that ar|tifice
which is shewn in stratagems and circumventions, against an enemy that is not only
in hostility, but a state of defiance, (for where he reposes any confidence in you, it alters
the case) and such as I mean, was the artifice of Hanibal when he pretended to fly, only to
possess himself of some passes, and so block up the Consul and his Army; as also when to
clear himself of Fabius Maximus, he found out the invention of binding fire-brands and
other combustible matter about the horns of the Cattel, and turning them out upon the
enemy. And much of this nature was that of Pontius General for the Samnites; which
he used to circumvent the Roman Army ad Tureas Caudinas. Pontius having disposed
his Army privately upon the mountains; sent several of his Souldiers habited like Shep|herds
with several herds of Cattel thorow the plain: being all taken and examined by the
Romans where the Army of the Samnites was, they unanimously concurred in the story
which Pontius had put into their mouths, that it was gone to besiege Nocera; which be|ing
credited by the Consul, he brake up from his post, and marching thorow the plain for
the relief of Nocera, he ran himself into the trap, and was no sooner entred, but he was
block'd up by the enemy. This exploit was fraudulently performed, yet it would have
been very honourable to Pontius, had he followed his Father's advice, who would have
had him either dismissed the Romans frankly, that they might have been obliged by their
usage, or else have put them all to the sword, that they might have taken no revenge; but
he took the middle way, Quae neque amicos parat, neque inimicos tollit; Which neither mul|tiply'd
his friends, nor lessened the number of his foes. Which way has always been perni|tious
in matters of state, as has been shewn elsewhere.


CHAP. XLI.
That ones Country is to be defended by all means, and whether honourable or
dishonourable it imports not, 'tis well defended.
THe Roman Army and their Consul (as is said before) were block'd up by the Samnites,
who having proposed terms to them which were very dishonourable, as that they
should be dismissed sub jugum, and disarm'd (in token of bondage,) and then sent back
again to Rome. The Consuls were amazed at the motion, and the whole Army was in
despair; when Lentulus the Roman Legate stood up, and told them that in his judgment
no conditions were to be scrupled at that time when their Country was at stake: for the
safety of Rome consisting in the safety of that Army, the Army was to be preserved, and
that Country which is defended, is well defended, let the way be as it will, honoura|ble
or not honourable, it matters not: for if that Army was preserved, in time Rome might
work off that disgrace; but if it were lost, (though it perished never so bravely) Country,
and Liberty and all would be lost with it: and so his Counsel was followed. And this
ought to be considered and observed by every man whose office it is to advise for the good
of his Country; for where the safety of that is in question, no other consideration ought

to be coincident, as whether the way be just or unjust; merciful or cruel, honourable or
dishonourable; but postponing all other respects, you are to do that which shall procure
the safety of your Country, and preservation of its liberty. And this is effectually imi|tated
by the French both in their words, and deeds, whenever the Majesty of their Prince,
or the interest of their Country is at stake. For there is nothing they bear with less patience,
than to hear a man say such a thing is dishonourable for their King; for they believe their
King uncapable of dishonour, be his Counsels or his fortune what they will, because whe|ther
he wins or loses, or whatever is done, all makes for the King.


CHAP. XLII.
That forc'd Promises are not binding.
THe Consuls being returning to Rome, with their Army disarmed, and a scandal upon
them for the dishonourable conditions to which they had submitted; the first who
spake against the keeping them, was S. Postumius the Consul, who persuaded the Senate
that only himself, and those who accepted them, were obliged thereby; and that they did
not extend to the people of Rome; wherefore if the people of Rome would be never so
exact, the most that could be expected from them, would be but to deliver up him, and
all those who had engaged themselves into the hands of the Samnites; and this he main|tained
with so much obstinacy and zeal, that the Senate was onvinced, and sent him and
the rest back Prisoners to the Samnites, with a protestation against the Peace, as not ex|tending
to them; and fortune was so favourable to Postumius in the business, that the Sam|nites
not retaining him, he return'd to Rome, and was in greater reputation there after
his loss, than Pontius was among the Samnites after his Victory. And here there are two
things more particularly remarkable: One is, That there is no action, but is capable of
producing honour and renown; in victory there is nothing more frequent: In loss, it is
possible, by making it appear that it came not by your fault; or else by doing some action
presently after, that may recompense and repair it. The other is, That it is not scanda|lous
to break such promises as are extorted by force. For in promises relating to the pub|lick,
if they be obtained by force, when the force ceases, the promise ceaseth with it, and
may be neglected without any disgrace. Of this, all History is full of examples, and there
is not a day but presents us with new: For as we see Princes make no Conscience of per|forming
any thing that they are obliged to by force, especially if the force be removed;
so they are as little tender of their promises in other things, when the cause which press'd
them to promise is taken away: which whether commendable or not in a Prince, or binding
or not binding, I shall not determine in this place, having spoken of it so largely in my
Treatise called The Prince.


CHAP. XLIII.
Those who are born in the same Country, retain almost the same Nature
thorow all the variety of times.
WIsemen were wont to say (and perhaps not unworthily) That he who would
know what will be, must consider what has been already, because there is nothing
in the world now, nor will be hereafter, but what has and will have conformity with
the productions of former times; and the reason is, because proceeding from men who
have, and have had always the same passions, they must necessarily have the same effects.
'Tis true indeed their actions are sometimes better and more virtuous in this Province, than
in that, and in that more than in another, according to the difference of their Education,
for from the manner of their breeding, people take the first rudiments of their conver|sation;
and it makes it more easie to conjecture future events, by what is passed, when we
see some Nations retaining their humours and peculiarities a long time. So one Nation
has been always covetous, another fraudulent; and so on the other side, one has been con|stantly
famous for one virtue, and another for another. He who peruses the passages of
old in our very City of Florence, and compares them with our modern, will find that it
has been all along exposed to the avarice, pride, cruelty, and falshood of the Germans and

French: Every one knows how unfaithfully we have been dealt withal: How often
Charles VIII. of France received our Money, and promised to restore the Citadels at Pisa;
but never perform'd, which was a great instance of his infidelity, and avarice. But to
wave such recent examples, every one knows what hapned in the War betwixt the Floren|tines,
and the Visconti Dukes of Milan. The Florentines being destitute of other expe|dients,
resolved to bring the Emperor into Italy, to fall upon Lombardy with all his power
and reputation. The Emperor engaged to bring a great Army into Italy; to make War
upon the Visconti, and to defend Florence against them, upon condition the Florentines
pay'd him 100000 Ducats by way of advance, and as much more when they came into
Italy. The Florentines agreed, paid their first Money down, and the rest when they enter'd
Italy; yet when he had marched as far as Verona, he turned back without doing any thing,
complaining of the Florentines for want of performance: So that had not Florence been
under some extraordinary necessity, or passion, or had they ever read and considered the
ancient customs of those Nations, they would never have been so often over-reached, see|ing
they have been always alike, and used the same practices in all places, with all people.
Thus they served the Tuscans of old, who having been many times over-power'd and
routed, and dispersed by the Romans, and finding their own force unable to defend them;
they articled with the French on this side of the Alps to give them a Sum of Money, for
which the French were to joyn their forces with the Tuscaps, and march with them against
the Romans: But when the French had got their Money, they refused to perform the con|ditions
on their part, alledging that they received it not to make War upon the Romans,
but to forbear infesting them themselves: by which infidelity and avarice in the French, the
poor Tuscans were at once defeated both of their Money and assistance. From whence we
may conclude that the Tuscans were formerly of the same nature as now, and especially
the Florentines, and the French and other foreign Nations had always the same inclination
to deceive them.


CHAP. XLIV.
Confidence and boldness does many times obtain that which would never be
compassed by ordinary means.
THe Samnites were invaded by the Romans, and their Army so weak, it durst not meet
them in the field: whereupon it was resolved, That all their Garisons should be
reinforced, and with the rest of their Troops they should pass into Tuscany (which was
then at peace with the Romans) and try if they could tempt them to take up Arms, and
break their Peace; and in the Harangue which was made by the Samnites to the Tuscans to
remonstrate upon what occasion they had taken up Arms themselves, they had this expres|sion,
Rebellasse quod pax servientibus gravior, quam liberis bellum. They had rebelled,
because Peace was more insupportable in servitude, than War to men that are free. And so
partly by persuasions, and partly by the presence of their Army, they prevailed with them
to take Arms against the Romans, which they had refused to their Embassadors before.
From whence it is to be observed, that when a Prince desires to obtain any thing of another
(if occasion permits) he ought not to give him time to consider, but is to act so as he may
see a necessity upon him of resolving immediately; and this is done when the person to
whom the demand is made sees that in either denying it absolutely, or delaying his answer,
he runs a manifest danger. This way was used very handsomely in our days by Pope Iu|lius
with the French; and Monsieur de Foix (the King of France's General) against the
Marquess of Mantoua. Pope Iulius resolving to drive the Family of the Bentivogli out of
Bolonia; and judging that to do it, he should have need of the assistance of the French,
and that it would be convenient the Venetians should stand Neuter; To this purpose he
sent Embassadors to them both, but could get nothing but uncertain and ambiguous an|swers;
wherefore to surprize them, and bring them that way to his lure whether they
would or no, he got what Forces he could together, and marching directly to Bolonia, sent
to the Venetians to let them know he expected they should stand Neuter; and to the French
to send him Supplies: Both of them finding themselves under a necessity of answering
immediately, and that there was no time allowed to consider, fearing the displeasure and
indignation of his Holiness, they both of them complyed; the Venetian did not meddle;
and the French sent him assistance. Monsieur de Foix being another time with his Army in
Bolonia, and understanding the defection of Brescia, he resolved to go immediately and

endeavour to reduce it. There were but two ways that he could possibly pass; one was
thorow the Dominions of his Master, but that was tedious and about; the other was a
shorter cut, thorow the Territories of the Marquess of Mantoua; but then he was not only
to force his way thorow that Country, but, he was to pass certain Sluces betwixt Fens and
Lakes (with which that Country abounds) and that was not to be done without great
difficulty, in respect of several Forts which were upon them, and all well guarded by the
Marquess: However de Foiz resolved upon the shortest, in spite of the difficulty; and that
the Marquess might have no time to deliberate, he marched with his Army, and at the
same moment sent a Messenger to the Marquess for the Keys of such Castles as stood in his
passage; and the Marquess surprized with the suddenness and confidence of the demand,
sent them immediately, which he would never have done had they been more modestly de|sired;
the Marquess being in League with the Venetian and Pope, in whose hands he had
likewise a Son at that time; all which, had he had time to have considered, would have
been very laudable reasons to have denyed it: But being press'd of a sudden, he sent them
(as is said before:) Just so it was betwixt the Tuscans, and the Samnites; the presence of
the Samnian Army having forced them to take Arms, which they had refused before, and
had scarcely done then, had they had liberty to have advis'd.


CHAP. XLV.
Whether in a Battel it is best to give or receive the Charge.
DEvius, and Fabius two Roman Consuls, were in the field with two Armies against
the Samnites, and Tuscans; and being come to a Battel, it is observable that they
took two several ways in the manner of their fighting, and it is worth our enquiry which
of them was the best. Decius charged the Enemy with all imaginable fury, and engaged
his whole Army at once: Fabius received the charge, and (judging that way the most
safe) reserved his effort till the last, when (as we say) the Enemy had spent their fire, and
the heat of their fury was over. By the success of the Battel, it appeared that the design
of Fabius was better than that of Decius, who tired with the vehemence of his first charge,
and seeing his men engaged farther among the Enemy, than otherwise they would have
been, to gain that honour by his death, which he could not hope for by the Victory, in
imitation of his Father, he sacrificed himself for the Roman Legions. Which when Fa|bius
understood, that he might not gain less honour by living, than his colleague should
do by his death, he advanced with his Reserves, and charg'd the Enemy so briskly, that
he overthrew them, and gained a happy and most memorable Victory. By which it ap|pears
that the way of Fabius was more imitable and secure.


CHAP. XLVI.
How it comes to pass that in a City the same Family retains the same manners
and customs a long time.
IT appears that not only one City has its manners and institutions different; and produ|ces
men more austere, or effeminate than the rest; but in the same City Families are
frequently found to have the same difference. Of this there are multitude of Examples,
and particularly in Rome. The Manlii were always rigid and severe: The Publicoli benign,
and lovers of the people: The Appii ambitious and enemies to the people, and so in several
other Families they had their peculiar qualities that discriminated them from the rest;
which cannot proceed barely from their extraction and blood (for that must of necessity
have been altred by the variety of their Marriages) but rather from the diversity of their
Education, in the several Families; for it is a great matter when a man is accustomed to
hear well or ill of any thing from his infancy; and makes such an impression in him, that
from thence he many times regulates his conversation as long as he lives; and if this were
not so, it would have been impossible that all the Appii should have been agitated by the
same passion and ambition, as Livy observed in most of them; and particularly in one of
the last, who being made Censor, and to deposite his Office at the expiration of 18 months
according to Law, refused it absolutely (though his Colleague resigned) insisting upon an

old Law made by the Censors to continue their Magistracy for five years and though there
were many meetings, and great contention and tumult about this; yet in spite both of
Senate and People he could not be brought to deposite. And he who reads the Oration
which he made against P. Sempronius the Tribune of the people, will discern the insolence
of that Family, and the bounty and humanity of several other Citizens expressed by their
obedience to the Laws, and their affection to their Country.


CHAP. XLVII.
A good Citizen is to forget all private injury, when in competition
with his love to his Country.
MAnlius the Consul being employed in the Wars against the Samnites, received a wound
that disabled him for executing his charge; upon which the Senate thought sit to
send Papirius Cursor the Dictator to supply his place, and the Dictator being by the Laws
to be nominated by Fabius, who was then with his Army in Tuscany, they were fearful
(in respect of an old quarrel betwixt them) that Fabius would not name him. Whereupon
the Senate dispatched two Embassadors toward him, to intreat that (laying aside all pri|vate
animosity) he would name Cursor for Dictator, which Fabius did out of love to his
Country; though by his sullenness and silence, and several other signs he signified his relu|ctancy,
and that that Election went against the hair: From hence therefore all good Citi|zens
are to take example, and learn to prefer the publick good, before any private quarrel
of their own.


CHAP. XLVIII.
When an Enemy commits any grand fault, 'tis to be suspected for a fraud.
FUlnius being left Lieutenant of the Roman Army in Tuscany, upon the Consuls going
to Rome to be present at some Ceremony, the Tuscans to draw him into a trap, lay'd
an Ambuscade for him not far from his Camp; and having disguised some of their Soldiers
in the habit of Shepheards, they caused them to drive certain Cattel within sight of the
Romans; and the Shepheards were so exact in their obedience, that they came up to their
very Stoccadoes: The Lieutenant wondered at their confidence; and the unreasonableness
of the thing gave him occasion to suspect; whereupon he found out a way to discover the
fraud, and frustrate the whole plot: From whence we may observe that a General is not
to presume upon any gross error that his enemy commits; because it is not rational to be|lieve
he would be so sottish, and inconsiderate, were there not some stratagem at the bot|tom;
yet many times men are so blinded with desire of Victory, that they see nothing but
what makes for themselves. The French having overthrown the Romans not far from the
Allia, and pursuing them to Rome, found the gates open, and without any guards to de|fend
them: They apprehended it a design, and stood drawn up all that day and the next
night, without daring to enter, not imagining the Romans could have been so abject and
imprudent as to have abandoned their Country. In the year 1508. when the Florentines
besieged Pisa, Alfonso del Mutolo a considerable Citizen of that Town, being Prisoner in
the Camp, promised that if they would give him his liberty, he would deliver one of the
Gates into their hands; the Florentines believed and discharged him; but coming after|wards
to negotiate more particularly with certain Commissioners deputed to that purpose,
he was so far from coming privately, that he was always accompanied with several of the
Pisans, only when they came to treat, he desired them to withdraw. Forasmuch therefore
as he came publickly, and attended by several Pisans, the Florentines had good reason to
suspect the performance of his promise: But the Florentines were so blinded with a desire
to have the City, that following the direction of Alfonso, they came up to the Gate towards
Lucca, expecting to be let in; but all things being prepared for them, they received a great
loss, and left many of their best Officers and Soldiers behind them.



CHAP. XLIX.
A Commonwealth which desires to preserve it self free, has need of new pro|visions
every day; and upon what score Fabius was called Maximus.
IT falls out of necessity (as has been said before) that in a great City there is not a day
but some accidents occur that have need to be remedied; and as they are of more or less
importance, so their Physician ought to be more or less expert. And if strange and un|expected
accidents ever hapned in any City, it was in Rome: one of which sort, was the
the general conspiracy of the Roman Women against their Husbands: some had poysoned
their Husbands already, and all the rest had their materials ready to do as much by theirs.
Of the same sort was the conspiracy of the Bacchanals, discovered during the time of the
Macedonian War, in which many thousands of Men and Women were engaged; which
would have been very dangerous for that City, had it not been discovered; for the Romans
had not a custom of punishing whole multitudes when they offended. And here we can|not
but admire the fortitude, the severity, the magnanimity of the Romans in punishing
offenders; which (if there were nothing else to evince it) would be a great testimony of
their virtue and power. For so great was their justice, they made no scruple to execute a
whole Legion, or City at a time: sometimes they banished 8 or 10000 men together with
such conditions as would have been insupportable to a single man: so it hapned to those
who escaped from the Battel at Cannas, they banished them all into Sicily, forbidding
them to Quarter in any Town, or to commit any disorder. But the most terrible of all
their executions was the decimation of their Armies, in which every tenth man was put to
death by lot quite thorow their Army; nor for the punishment of a multitude can any way
be found more formidable; for where a multitude transgresses, and no certain Author is
known, to punish the whole with death would be too severe; and to punish one part, and
excuse another would be injust to those who were punish'd, and encourage the other to
commit the same offence again: But where all are alike guilty, to execute every tenth man
by lots, gives him who is to be punished, occasion to complain only of his fortune; and
makes him who escapes afraid against the next time. The good Women then who would
have poyson'd their Husbands; and the Priests of Bacchus were punished as they deserv'd;
and though these maladies in a Commonwealth have many times very ill Symptoms,
yet they are not mortal, because there is still time enough for the cure. But where the
State is concern'd, it is otherwise, and time may be wanting; and therefore if they be
not seasonably and prudently redressed, the whole Government may miscarry. And this
may be clear'd to us, by what hapned in Rome. The Romans having been very free in
bestowing the freedom and priviledges of their City upon strangers, the strangers grew so
numerous by degrees, and to have so great a Vote in the Councils, that the whole Govern|ment
began to totter, and decline from its old, to its new Inhabitants; which being ob|served
by Quius Fabius the Censor, he applyed a remedy in time, by reducing all the new
Citizens into four Tribes; that being contracted into so narrow a space, they might not
have so malignant an influence upon the City; and this so timely and so useful expedient,
was taken so thankfully from him by the people, that they gave him the addition of Maxi|mus,
and he was called Fabius Maximus ever after.

THE
TRANSLATOR
TO THE
READER.
Kind Reader,
IT may seem strange to you at first, that I have divided
the Books of Machiavel, and disposed them into
Chapters contrary to the order of his Dialogues; but I
am assured when you consider my intention, you will rather
applaud than condemn me. I was always sensible that
no man could blame me, if I kept exactly to my Author;
nevertheless I thought this way more beneficial, the length
of a Discourse being commonly tiresome to any man who
affects brevity; besides that in all sorts of Books, these
kind of breaches and sections are very helpful to the
memory. For this reason the Works of Aristotle, Vi|truvius
and Pliny, which were originally in another
method, have been reduc'd since into this manner of divi|sion.
I have presum'd to do the same in this my Transla|tion,
having had more regard to the ease and advantage
of the Reader, than to the exact order of the Author
whom I have not followed verbatim, by reason of the
diversity of the Languages, yet his sense I have observed
as strictly as would consist with the propriety of our own
Language, assuring my self that your bounty will dispence
with some faults, seeing nothing can be done so accurate|ly,
but will be subject to many.




THE
PREFACE
OF
NICOLO MACHIAVELLI,
TO
Lorenzo the Son of Philippo Strozzi, Gentleman
of FLORENCE.
MAny have been, and are still of opinion, that in the whole
world no two things are more incongruous and dissimilar
than a Civil, and a Military life; insomuch that ma|ny
times when a man designs himself for a Soldier, he not only
takes upon him a new habit, but he changes his Customs, his
Company, his manner of Discourse, and leaves off all ways of civil
conversation; for he who would be light and nimble, and ready
for the execution of all sort of violence, looks upon a civil habit as
improper and cumbersome; civil customs are unsuitable to him
who thinks them soft and effeminate, and inconsistant with the
life he proposes; and indeed it would be undecent if a man whose
business it is to look big, and Hector, and fright the whole world
with his Oaths and his Blasphemies, should carry himself demure|ly,
and behave himself with the usual gentleness and complacency
of other men; and this is it which in our days makes this opinion
true: But if we consider the condition and method of old times,
we shall find no two things more united, more conformable; nor
more necessarily amicable than they. For all the Arts which are
contrived in a City for the common good; all the courses invented
to keep men in fear of God and the Laws would be useless and vain,
were not force provided for their defence; which force (if well or|dered)
will be able to make them good, though perhaps the Laws
are not so exact in themselves; for this is most certain, good Or|ders
without Military coertion will quickly moulder to nothing,
and run to decay like a Noble and Princely Palace that is unco|vered
at the top, and has nothing but the splendor and richness
of its furniture to defend it from the weather. And if anciently
Kingdoms and States imploy'd great industry to keep people in
peace, and in the faith and fear of God; certainly in the regu|lation
of their Military Discipline they employed much more;

for where can ones Country repose greater confidence, than in
him who has promised to die for it? Where can there be greater
inclination to Peace, than in him who is not capable of molestati|on
or injury, but by War? Where can there be more fear of God,
than in him who being obnoxious to hourly dangers, has more
need of his divine assistance. This necessity being well considered
by those who gave Laws to Kingdoms, and those who had the
Command of their Armies, was the cause that the life of a Souldier
was in great reputation with all people, and much imitated and
follow'd. But Military discipline being now totally deprav'd, and
degenerated from the practice of the ancients; that depravity
hath been the occasion of several ill opinions, which have brought
that Discipline into contempt, and made all people hate and a|void
the conversation of a Souldier. But considering with my
self both from what I have seen and read, that it is not impossible
to revive the discipline of our Ancestors; and reduce it to its pri|mitive
excellence, I resolved (to keep my self from idleness) to
write what I thought might be to the satisfaction of such persons as
were studious of the art of War, and lovers of Antiquity; 'tis
true, 'tis more than ordinary boldness to treat of this Subject,
where others have been so scrupulous and wary; yet I cannot think
it an error to write of what others have professed and exercised
with much more audacity and presumption; For my faults in
writing, may be corrected without prejudice to any body; but
those faults which they commit in the execution, cannot be repair'd,
but by the destruction and ruine of several people; consider then
(Sir) the quality of my labours, and according to your judgment
let them be approved or rejected, as you think they deserve: I
send them to you as a testimony of my gratitude, though my abi|lities
are not in the least commensurat with the greatness of your
favours: besides it being the custom to address things of this
nature to persons that are Illustrious for their Birth, wealth, parts,
or generosity: I knew you had not many equals in your Nobility
and Fortune, fewer in your parts; but in Generosity and Li|berality,
none at all.





THE
ART of WAR,
IN SEVEN
BOOKS.
LIBER I.

CHAP. I.
How the Seigneur Fabritio Colonna being refreshing himself one evening with
some other Gentlemen in a beautiful Garden, took occasion to enter upon this
discourse of War.
SEeing I am of opinion, that after a man is dead, it is lawful for any body to com|mend
him without danger of reproof, (because there can be no occasion nor suspicion
of flattery) I shall make no difficulty to speak something in praise of our renowned
and true friend Cosimo Rucellia, whose name I cannot remember without tears in my
eyes, having known in him all the good qualities, which one good Friend or good Citizen
would desire in another; for I know not any thing so dear to him, that he would not have
sacrificed for his friend; nor any thing so dreadful, that he would not have undertaken
for his Country: and I confess freely among all with whom I have had any acquaintance
and conversion, I do not know any man whose heart was more disposed to great and
magnificent things. At his death nothing troubled him so much (as he complained often
to his friends) as that he should die young, and in his own house without honour, or the
satisfaction of having been serviceable to any man as he desired, for he was sensible that
no more could be said of him than that he died a good friend. However it follows not
but we who were acquainted with him, may bear testimony of his virtues and good qua|lities,
seeing their is nothing left of his works or actions to recommend him to the World:
and yet fortune was not so much his enemy but she suffered him to leave a short monu|ment
of the dexterity of his wit, which appears in certain Sonnets, and amorous Verses
of his composition; in which way (though he was not amorous) he entertained himself
at idle times in his youth, till his Stars had conducted him to higher thoughts, by which
Verses it may easily be discerned with what comeliness and felicity he could have expressed
his conceptions, and how honourable he would have made himself by his Poetry, had he
made it his business. But fortune having deprived us of such a friend, it seems to me that
no better remedy can be applyed, than for us (as far as is possible) to make as much of his
memory as we can, and recollect such of his sayings, or arguments, as were either witty or
solid. And because there is nothing of him more fresh than the discourse which he had
lately with Fabritio Colonna in his Garden, (where the said Fabritio gave a large account
of all the mysteries of War one the one side, and Cosimo proposed, and objected, and argued
with as much gravity one the other) being then present by accident with other of our
friends, I have thought fit to put in writing, that by reading it, such of Cosimo's friends
as were there may, renew the memory of his Virtues; such as were not there, may be

troubled for their absence, and learn several things profitable not only for military, but civil
conversation.
I say then Fabritio Colonna returning from Lombardy, where for a long time he had done
very honorable service for the King of Spain, passing by Florence to repose himself some time
in that City, visit the Duke, and enjoy the company of certain Gentlemen with whom he had
had a former acquaintance, Cosimo held himself obliged to invite him to his Gardens not
so much to shew his own liberality and magnificence, as to have larger opportunity of
discoursing with him, and informing himself of such things as might be expected from a
person of his experience, and spending a whole day in discoursing of what might be to the
satisfaction of his mind. Fabritio accepted his invitation, came to his house, and was en|tertained
very nobly by Cosimo, with several other of his more particular friends as Zanobi
Buondelmonti, Battista dalla Palla, Luigi Alamanni and others, all of them young Gentle|men,
his intimate friends, and ardently studious of the same things, of whose qualifica|tions
I shall say nothing in this place, because being still living, their own actions do re|commend
them every hour of the day.
Fabritio was regall'd with as much pomp and magnificence as were consistent with the
time and the place: but dinner being ended, the tables taken way, and all the formalities
of the Feast over, which among persons of great minds, whose thoughts are employed
upon more honourable things, are not so tedious as with other people) the day being long,
and heat excessive, Cosimo thought it convenient for the better satisfaction of his designs,
under pretence of avoiding the heat, to carry Fabritio into a close and shady Arbour in the
Garden, where they might discourse with more leisure and privacy; and having brought
him and the rest of the Company to the place, some of them disposed themselves upon
the grass, (which was very pleasant and green) and others upon seats under the shadow of
those lofty trees; Fabritio began to applaud the delightsomness of the place, and then look|ing
particularly upon the trees, and not knowing of some of them, he stood still, as it were
in suspence, which being observed by Cosimo, he told him, 'tis possible, Sir, you may not
be acquainted with those trees, but 'tis no wonder, for some of them were in more request
with our fore-Fathers than they are with us, and having told him their names, and what
delight Seignor Bernardo his Grand-father took in planting, Fabritio replyed, I thought
they were as you say; but the pleasantness of this place, and the innocence of that em|ployment
puts me in mind of some Princes in the Kingdom of Naples who delighted
themselves exceedingly in those kind of diversions, and would plant, and make delicate
Arbours to keep themselves from the heat; and thereupon breaking off short in his
discourse, he stood still for a while, as in some serious suspence, but presently he told them
if I thought I should not misbehave my self, (which among my friends I suppose is not
easy) I would give you my opinion of it, not to traduce or calumniate them, but for
discourse sake, and to pass away the time; for doubtless those Princes (under correction)
had done much better to have imitated their Ancestors in great and heroick, rather than
in soft and effeminate things; to have followed their examples in the heat of the Sun, ra|ther
than to have retir'd and withdrawn themselves into the coolness of a shade; and ra|ther
to have personated their fore-Fathers in what was solid and perfect, than in what was
delicate, and corrupt; for since these kind of entertainments have been pleasing to our
Country-men, our Country has gone to ruine, and all things declined.

Cosimo.
You have opened a way to a discourse which I desire exceedingly, and there|fore
I beg of you that you would speak of it frankly, without respect to any body, seeing
I intend to interrogate you with the same freedom, and if in my demands or replies I ex|cuse,
or accuse any man, it will not be barely to excuse or accuse him, but to understand the
truth.


Fabritio.
I shall be well pleased to inform you of anything I know, and shall leave it
to your discretion to judge whether what I say be true or false, expecting to learn as much
from your demands, as you will do from my answers; for a wise question makes a man
consider many things which perhaps he regarded not before; and understand others, which
without interrogation he had never understood.


Cosimo.
I will return to what you said first, that my Grand-father, and your fore-Fathers
would have done more prudently to have imitated their Ancestors in difficult and
generous things, rather than in what was delicate and soft; and in this I will excuse my
part, and leave the other to be defended by you. I am of opinion that there was not a
man in his time who detested all kind of effeminacy more than he, and who was a greater
lover of that kind of activity and vigour which you so much commend, nevertheless he
found that he could not make use of it either in his own person, or in the persons of his
Children, being born in so corrupt an age, that a man who should have deviated from the

common practice of those times, would have made himself contemptible to every body.
For if a man in the heat of Summer should have lien basking upon the sands; or in the
midst of Winter should have taken up his quarters in the snow, (as Diogenes did) he would
have been thought a fool, or a mad-man: should a man have followed the Spartan way,
brought up his children in some cottage, taught them to sleep in the fields; to run about
bare-foot and bare-headed; wash in cold water to inure them to hardship, and by making
them less fond of life, to make them less sensible of death, he would have been despised for
his pains; and have been thought rather a bruit than a man. Again should a man have
been observed to starve his own carkass, and to live only upon beans and pease, and such
kind of pulse, and have made as small account of mony as Fabritius did of what was offer|ed
him by the Samnites, 'tis possible he might have been commended by some few, but he
should have been followed by no body: being discouraged therefore by the practice of
the present age, he followed not the example of his Ancestors exactly, but followed them
as much as he could, with as little notice and admiration to the World.


Fabritio.
You have excused your Grand-father very handsomly on that particular, and
what you have said is doubtlesly true; but I did not speak so much of that hard and rustick
way of living, as of other ways that are more soft and effeminate; have greater confor|mity
and correspondence with our present times, and are (in my judgment) easily to be
introduced by any man who has the government of affairs: and in my discourse of this
matter I shall not need to straggle into other Countries for examples, for the Romans (my
own Country-men) will furnish me abundantly; whose Practices, and order of Govern|ment,
if well considered, will not be found so impossible to be introduced in any other
City where there is but the least spark of virtue and goodness.


Cosimo.
What are those things that you would introduce according to the example
of our Ancestors?


Fabritio.
To honour and reward virtue; not to dispise poverty; to value order and
discipline of war; to constrain Citizens to love one another; to live without factions; to
postpone all private interest to the publick; and several other things that may easily ac|commodate
with our times; and these things are not difficult to be introduced, provided
it be done deliberately and by right means, because in them the truth is so manifest and ap|parent,
that the commonest capacity may apprehend it. He therefore who orders his af|fairs
in this manner, plants himself trees which will afford him a happier and more plea|sant
shelter and protection than these,


Cosimo.
I will not reply to what you have said, but referring it to the discretion of the
company, (who can easily judge of it) I shall address my discourse to you, who seems to
find fault with all those who in their great and weighty affairs do not follow the examples
of our Ancestors, supposing thereby I may be more easily satisfied in my intention. I
would know therefore how it comes to pass that, on one side you condemn all those who
do not imitate the practice of our Ancestors; and yet on the other, in your wars (which
is your profession, and excellence) it does not appear that you have made use of any thing
of the ancient method and discipline, or done any thing that resembled it.


Fabritio.
You are now come to the point where I expected you, and indeed my
discourse deserved, and I my self desired no other demand. And though I might save
my self the labour, with a very plausible excuse, yet I will satisfie both your desire and my
own, and that the more largely, because both time and place concurs to our convenience.
Men who are desirous to do any great action, are first to prepare themselves with all dili|gence
and industry, that when occasion is offered, they may be ready to execute and com|pleat
it. And because where those preparations are made cautiously, they are not to be
discovered; no man is to be accused of negligence, unless occasion discovers him first, to
which if he be remiss, and makes not use of his time to execute his design, it gives us to un|derstand,
that either he has not prepar'd as he ought to have been, or that he had not
thought of it at all: and therefore no occasion having presented it self to me to discover
the preparations which I had made to reduce our Militia into the form of the ancients;
if I have not yet reduced it, I conceive I cannot justly be condemned, either by you,
or any body else: and this I think is a sufficient answer to your accusation.


Cosimo.
It would be sufficient indeed, could I be assured that you never had any occa|sion.


Fabritio.
But because I find you may doubt whether ever such occasion were offered
or not, I am content to discourse more largely (upon condition you will have the patience
to hear me) what preparations are necessary to be made; what occasion is necessary to be
had; what difficulties obstruct our preparatives, and hinder our occasion; and how this is
easie and hard to fall out at the same time, which seems a contradiction.



Cosimo.
You cannot do me and the whole company a greater favour; and if it will be
no trouble to you to enlarge, it will be none to us to attend: but because the discourse is
like to be long, I desire I may have the assistance of my friends, yet with your licence and
permission; wherefore they and I do make it our request, that you would not take it a miss
if we interrupt you sometimes with some importunate demand.


Fabritio.
I am very well contented, that you (Cosimo) and these young Gentlemen
your friends, ask any thing of me, because I believe the heat of your youth makes you in|clinable
to arms, and by consequence more apt to give credit to what I shall say: and
these other Gentlemen shall have the same liberty, because their grey heads, and their cold
blood, makes them commonly enemies to warfare, and incorrigible, as people possessed
with an opinion that it is the times, not the ill customs which constrains men to live at that
rate. Question me then freely, as you please; 'tis the thing I desire, because I shall there|by
have some respit, and repose; and withal, the satisfaction of clearing your doubts, and
leaving nothing unanswered in your minds.



CHAP. II.
A person of honour and condition is not to make War his profession.

Fabritio.
I Will begin my discourse with what you said, that in matter of War (which
is my profession) I never made use of any thing of the ancients, To which
I answer, that War being a profession by which men cannot live honourable at all times,
it is not to be taken up as a trade, unless it be by a Commonwealth, or a Kingdom, and if
they be well constituted, they will neither of them suffer any of their Citizens or Subjects,
or any other good man to make it his business; for he will never be thought a good man
who takes upon him an employment, by which if he would reap any profit at any time,
he is obliged to be false, and rapacious, and cruel, and to entertain several other qualities
that are not consistent in a good man; nor can any man (great or small) who makes war
his profession, be otherwise than vitious; because that that trade being not to be followed
in time of peace, they are necessitated either to prevent or obstruct peace; or in time of
war to provide so for themselves, that they may subsist in time of peace; and neither of
those two ways are practicable to an honest man; for from the desire of providing for
themselves against the evil day, when the wars should be ended, proceed the robberies, and
thefts, and murders which are committed daily by such kind of people, and that upon their
friends as well as enemies. And from the desire of obstructing the peace, proceed all the
frauds and jugling which the Officers use with those who pay them, and all to continue
the war; but if by accident peace be concluded contrary to their endeavours and design, it
is to be feared that the Officers finding themselves destitute of pay, and their old liberty
and licentiousness, will get together such Soldiers of fortune as have nothing to subsist
upon, and falling into some Province, plunder and rifle it without any compassion. Do
you not remember that here in Italy we had several of these disbanded Souldiers, which
got together when the wars were done, called themselves the Companies, and went up and
down ransacking Towns, and pillaging the Country, and all without remedy? Have you
not read how after the first Carthaginian War, disbanded Souldiers united under the
command of Matho and Spendius, (two of their Officers) and in a tumultuous manner
made a more dangerous War upon the Carthaginians than that which they had had with
the Romans; In the days of our Predecessors Francis Sforza not only betraid the Milanois
who had made him their General, but usurped upon their liberty, and made himself their
Prince, and for what, but that he might live in the same splendor when the Peace was con|cluded.
And all the rest of the great Officers in Italy were like him, (especially if War
was their profession) and though de facto they did not all make themselves Dukes of Milan
by their treachery, they were the more to be blamed, because without the temptation of
so great advantage their lives and exorbitances were as bad. The Father of Francis Sforza
being in the service of Queen Iane, constrained her to cast her self into the protection of
the King of Arragon, having deserted her on a sudden, and left her disarm'd in the midst
of her enemies, and all to satiate his ambition, to satisfy his revenge, or to have got her
Kingdom for himself. Braccio with the same industry endeavoured to possess himself of
the Kingdom of Naples, and had he not been defeated and slain at Aquila, he had certainly
effected it; and these confusions proceeded from nothing else but from the employing of
such men as were mercenary, and had nothing to subsist upon but their pay? Have you

not a Proverb which confirms what I say, and tells us, that War makes Thieves, and Peace
brings them to the Gallows; the reason is, for that those persons who have no other way of
livelihood, nor so much temper and ingenuity as to take to any other course that may ho|nestly
sustain them, are forced by necessity to rob upon the high-ways, and then justice is
forced to dispatch them,


Cosimo.
You have represented this trade and profession of a Souldier so vile and con|temptible,
that to me it seems now to be worse than none at all, whereas before I thought
it one of the most noble and excellent things in the World: so that unless you satisfie me
better, I shall never be contented; for if it be so as you say, I cannot imagin how it
should come to pass that Caesar, and Pompey, and Scipio, and Marcellus, and so many other
great Captains of the Romans should become so famous as to be worshipped like
Gods.


Fabritio.
I have not yet thorowly examined those two things which I proposed in the
beginning; one is, that a good man cannot take up that calling as his profession: the
other is, that no well constituted Government (whether Commonwealth or Kingdom)
will suffer its Subjects or Citizens to make War their whole business. To the first I have
spoke what I thought fit; it remains now that I speak to the second, in which I shall have
occasion to reply to your last demand.



CHAP. III.
How a Commonwealth ought not (in prudence) to permit any of its Citizens to
make War their profession.

Fabritio.
TOuching the Romans which you mentioned, it is true Pompey and Caesar, and
most of the great Captains who were at Rome after the last Carthaginian
War, arrived at great reputation, but it was rather as brave and generous, than good and
virtuous men; whereas those who were before them, were famous as much for their vir|tue
as conduct, and the reason was, because these made not War their profession, and the
others did.
Whilst the Roman Commonwealth was incorrupt and immaculate, there never was any
Citizen who presumed by means of this profession to make his own fortune or party in
time of Peace; by breaking the Laws, exacting upon the provinces, usurping and tyran|nizing
over his Country, and using all means to make himself rich. No man of inferior
condition ever thought of violating his Oaths; maintaining of Parties; disrespecting the
Senate; or promoting of tumults or any tyrannical sedition with design of making him|self
a fortune by the profession of Arms. But those who had the command of their
Armies, contented with their triumphs, returned joyfully to their private affairs; and the
Officers who were under them laid down their Arms with more alacrity than they had
taken them up; every man returning to his former course of life, without any hopes of
advancing himself by plunder and rapine. And of this we have strong and evident
cause of conjecture from the example of Regulus Attilius, who being General of the
Roman Armies in Africa, and having in a manner conquered the Carthaginians, desired leave
of the Senate to return, that he might look to a Farm of his in the Country which his
servants had neglected. From whence it is as clear as the day, that had he made War his
profession, or designed to have raised his own fortune out of the ruins of other people
having so many Provinces at his mercy, he would never have been so careful of the im|provement
of a Cottage, when every day would have brought him in more than his whole
Patrimony was worth. But because good men, and such as are not desirous to make a trade
of War, are unwilling to reap any other fruit therefrom but labour, and danger, and glory;
when they are arrived at a sufficient proportion of the later, 'tis their ambition to return
quietly to their houses, and live upon their old professions in Peace. As to the common
and private Soldiers, it's clear they were of the same humour, and declin'd any such pro|fession;
for though when they were at home, they desired many of them to be in the
wars, yet when they were in the wars, they were as willing to be dismissed. This is ma|nifest
by several arguments, but especially by the priviledg which the Romans granted to
their Citizens, that none of them should be constrained to the wars against his own in|clination.
So that Rome whilst it was well governed (which was till the time of the
Gracchi) had never any Souldier who made it his profession to be so, by which means few
of them were dissolute, and those who were, were punished severely. A City then well

constituted and governed is to take care that this Art of War be used in time of Peace only
as an exercise, and in time of War only for necessity, and the acquisition of glory; leaving
the constant practice and profession of it to the State, as the Romans did anciently to the
Commonwealth of Rome. That Citizen who has any other design in the profession of
Arms, let him be what he will, is no honest man; and that City which is governed any
other way, is as much in the wrong.


Cosimo.
I am very well satisfied with what you have said hitherto, and do acquiesce in
your conclusion as far as it relates to a Commonwealth, but as to Kings I am apt to dissent
because I am apt to think it convenient a King should have those about him who made
Arms their profession.



CHAP. IV.
That a King ought not to permit his Subjects to make Arms their profession,
for the mischiefs which do frequently ensue.

Fabritio.
A Kingdom well govern'd ought the more carefully avoid people of that con|dition,
because it is they who debauch their King by being the only Mini|sters
of his Tyranny. And do not object to me any of our present Kingdoms; for I shall
deny absolutely that they are as well governed as formerly, when Kings had no Soveraignty,
nor absolute power, but in the Armies, because there (and no where else) there is a
necessity of speedy resolutions; and that such a power should be reposed in a single person;
in other cases they ought to do nothing without their Counsel, and it is to be the particular
care of all that are of Counsel to a Prince, to keep off such persons from about him as pro|mote
War in time of Peace, because they cannot frame themselves to any other way of
subsistance. But I will discourse something more largely of this matter, not standing so
much upon a Kingdom that is perfectly good according to the model of the Ancients, but
supposing such a one as is like the Kingdoms of our days; in which likewise a King ought
to be fearful of such as live wholly by War, because the Nerves and strength of all Armies
lyes certainly in the Infantry.
Wherefore if a King orders his matters so ill, that his foot be not content to return to
their several callings in time of Peace, and live as formerly by their labour, he must neces|sarily
be ruined; for of all the Soldiers in the world none are so dangerous as those who
make War their profession; and the reason is, because you must be always at War, or keep
them always in pay; otherwise you will run a great hazard of being turn'd out of your
Kingdom; and because it is impossible either to maintain War perpetually, or keep them
in continual pay, you will be in great danger of being driven out of your Kingdom. My
Country-men the Romans (as I said before) whilst they were wise, and honest, never suf|fered
their Citizens to make that exercise their calling, though in respect of their perpetual
Wars, they were able to have pay'd them perpetually: But to avoid the inconveniencies
which might follow thereupon, seeing the condition of their times did not alter, they
altered their Men, ordering their affairs in such manner, that every fifteen years their Le|gions
were renewed, and filled up again with young men in the flower of their age;
that is to say, betwixt eighteen and thirty five years of age; during which time their legs
their hands, and their eyes do correspond one with the other, and are in the same disposi|tion;
for they did not keep them till their strength and vigour decayed, and their froward|ness,
and insolence increased, as they did afterwards when the times were more corrupt.
For Octavian first, and afterwards Tiberius (preferring their private power before the
profit of the publick) began to disarm the people (that thereby they might have them
more easily at command) and to keep standing Armies upon the Frontiers of their Em|pire.
But because they thought them insufficient to curb the people, and awe the Senate
of Rome; they established another Army (which they called the Pretorian) which was
quartered always about the City, and intended as a guard. But when afterwards the Em|perors
permitted them who were listed in those Bands, to lay aside all other professions, and
devote themselves to War, they grew insolent immediately, and became not only ter|rible
to the Senate, but pernicious to the Emperor, insomuch that many of them were
put to death by the fury and insolence of those Soldiers, who created, and disposed their
Emperors as they pleased; and sometimes it fell out that at the same time several Empe|rors
were created by the several Armies, which occasioned the division first, and by degrees
the destruction of the Empire. Those Kings therefore who are desirous to live in safety

and peace, ought to have their Armies composed of such persons, as when there is a neces|sity
of War, will take up Arms freely for the defence of their Country; and when Peace
is concluded, will as readily acquiesce, and return to their old habitations and callings;
which may easily be done; if they make their Levies of such men as have professions before:
A King is likewise (upon the publication of Peace) to command his Generals and great
Officers to their respective charges and governments elsewhere; the Reformades and Gen|tlemen
to their own Houses and Estates; and the common Soldiers to their Original Trades
and Occupations. And by the election of such men, they will fight stoutly to procure
Peace, but never disturb Peace to create a War.


Cosimo.
I must confess your discourse to me seems very considerable; yet being so con|trary
to what I fancied before, my mind is not so well satisfied but there remains some
doubt behind which is still to be cleer'd: for I observe several Lords and Gentlemen who
in time of Peace maintain themselves wholly by the profession of Arms; as several great
Commanders of your acquaintance and quality, who are in pay under several Princes and
States; besides most of the men at Arms are continued in pay for the guard and security of
such Cities and Castles as are requisite to be kept; so that in my judgment there is employ|ment
enough for them all in time of Peace.


Fabritio.
I do not believe that you can think that in time of Peace there is entertainment
for them all; for if no other reason was to be alledged, the smallness of the numbers re|quir'd
to the furnishing the Garrisons, would be sufficient to refute it. What proportion
is there betwixt the Bodies of foot which are to be raised for carrying on a War, and those
which are required for supplying the Garrisons in time of Peace: for those Cities and
Castles which in time of Peace are kept with a few men, are reinforced with great num|bers
in time of War; besides which, great Levies are made for the Field Armies, which
upon the conclusion of Peace are constantly disbanded. And as to such as are retained in
the nature of Guards to the State, Pope Iulius and you, have demonstrated how much
those are to be apprehended who will not entertain any other vocation but War; having
turned them out of your Guards for their insolence, and entertained Swizzers in their
places, as people born and brought up under Laws, and chosen by the Communalty by a
more regular election; so that tell me no more there is employment for them all in times
of Peace. As to the men at Arms, and their being continued in pay in times
of peace, the answer I confess is more difficult; yet upon closer examination it will not be
found impossible, because this custom of keeping men at Arms in pay is corrupt, and in|convenient;
the reason is, for that they are people who having no other Vocations, are
occasions of daily disorders in the State, especially where their numbers are great; but where
they are not so numerous as to make an Army of themselves, the danger of them is so
much the less. Yet many times they have done mischief enough, as I have said before in
the cases of Francis Sforza, his Father and Braccio da Peruga. So that I cannot approve
this Custom of keeping men at Arms in constant pay, having seen so much experience of
their corruptions, and the inconvenience which has followed thereupon.


Cosimo.
Would you have no such Forces in pay at all? or if you would have them; how
would you have them entertained?


Fabritio.
Not as the men at Arms in France, for they are as dangerous and insolent as
ours, but rather according to the method of the ancients, who raised their Cavalry out of
their own Subjects, whom they sent home again to their houses when Peace was concluded
to follow their old Callings, as shall be shown more largely before we end our discourse;
so that if these kind of Soldiers do now (even in times of Peace) receive pay, and live under
that profession, it proceeds from corruption in their customs. And as to the Pensions which
I, and my fellow Officers receive, I say that that also is a corrupt custom; for a wise, and
well ordered Government ought not to entertain any such Pensioners, but is rather to em|ploy
their own Citizens for Generals in time of War, and when that is done, dismiss them
to their own private affairs. And with a wise King it is the same; he is either to give
no such Pensions at all, or if he does, it ought to be in recompence of some signal ex|ploit,
or to oblige some excellent person in time of Peace as well as War. And because
you have instanced in me, I am content to stand for an example; and therefore I say I never
made War my profession. My business is to govern my subjects, to defend them, to pre|fer
Peace, but yet to know how to manage my self in War; and if I have received honour
or reward from the King, it is not for my understanding of experience in War, so much as
for my integrity and counsel in times of Peace. A wise Prince ought not therefore to have
any about him, but such as are so constituted; for if they be too zealous either for Peace
or for War, they will draw him into inconvenience. This (according to my proposition
at first) I could not but say as to the first point; if it be insufficient, you must apply your

self elsewhere for farther satisfaction. But by what is said, you may perceive the difficulty
of reviving the customs of the Ancients in our present Wars: What preparations are requi|site
to be made by any man that is wise, and what opportunities are to be expected to
bring them to perfection; But you will understand them etter if your patience will give
me leave to discourse them from point to point, and compare all the customs of the an|cients,
with the particular practices of our times.


Cosimo.
If we desired at first to hear you discourse of these things, certainly what you
have discoursed already, has much encreased our desire; wherefore as we give you thanks for
what you have done, so we do earnestly beg of you that you would proceed to the remainder



CHAP. V.
In what Countries the best Soldiers are to be raised.

Fabritio.
SEeing you are hitherto so well pleased, I will deduce my discourse of this mat|ter
from the fountain, that thereby you may comprehend it the better, and I
be enabled to demonstrate it more copiously. When War is resolved, every man's chief
business is to put himself into a condition of giving the Enemy Battel, and fighting him
fairly in the field. To enable himself for this, it is necessary to raise an Army; to raise
an Army, there is a necessity of men, of arming them, disciplining them, exercising
them, (and that in great as well as small bodies) of teaching them to encamp, and ac|quainting
them with the Enemy by degrees, either by frequent facing or confronting him,
or by encamping somewhere near his march, where they may have the prospect of his Army
as he passes by. In this the whole address and industry of a Campania, or field War con|sists,
which doubtless is more necessary and honorable than any other; and he who under|stands
well how to draw up an Army, and present his Enemy Battel, may be excused for
all his other errors in the management of the War; but if he be ignorant or defective in
that, though in other things he be sufficient enough; yet he shall never bring his War to
any honourable conclusion. For win a Battel, and you cancel all your former miscarriages;
lose one, and all that ever you did well before evaporates, and comes to nothing.
It being so necessary then to find men, the first thing to be done, is to know how to
make our choice (which the ancients called Delectus, and we Levies) of which I shall give
you some light.
They who have given us rules of the management of War, have recommended to us to
make our Levies in temperate regions, that our Soldiers may be both valiant, and cunning
For hot Countries are observed to produce wise and subtle people, but not couragious; cold
Countries on the other side do afford stout men, and hardy, but then they are seldom dis|creet.
This Rule was proper enough for a Prince that was Monarch of the whole world,
and might make his Levies where he pleas'd: But to give a rule that all may follow, I must
needs say that all Commonwealths, or Kingdoms, are to make their Levies in their own
Countries, whether hot or cold, or temperate, it's the same thing; because by ancient ex|perience
we find that in any Country, Exercise and Discipline makes good Soldiers; for
where Nature is defective, industry will supply; and in this case it's the better of the two.
And indeed to raise men in other Countries cannot be call'd properly a delectus, for delectum
habere is to pick and cull the best men in a Province, and to have power to choose those
who are unwilling as well as those who are willing to the War; which kind of delectus
cannot be made exactly but in your own dominion; for in Countries belonging to another
Prince, you must be contented with such as are willing, it being not to be expected that you
should have liberty to choose as you please.


Cosimo.
Yet among those who are willing, you may pick and choose, take and leave
what you think good, and therefore it is not so improper to call that a delectus.


Fabritio.
You are in the right as to one way; but if you consider the secret defects of
such an Election, you will find that in strictness it is not an Election; and that for these
following reasons. First, those who are not your Subjects, but are willing to the Wars,
are none of the best, but generally the lewdest and most dissolute persons in the Province;
for if any be scandalous, idle, incorrigible, irreligious, disobedient to their Parents, Blas|phemers,
Cheats, and altogether ill bred, they are those who are most likely to list them|selves
for the War, and there is nothing so contrary to good and true discipline, as such
kind of humors: When of such kind of Cattle you have more offer themselves, than the
number you design to entertain, you may take your choice indeed, but the whole mass be|ing

bad, your choice can never be good. But many times it falls out, that there being not
so many of them as you have occasion to employ, you are glad to take all, and in that case
you cannot not be said habere delectum so properly, as milites conscribere: And of such kind of
disorderly people, the Armies of Italy and most other places do consist at this day; only in
Germany it is otherwise, because there, no man is press'd or listed barely upon the Emperor's
command, but as he stands willing and disposed to the Wars himself; you may judge then
what part of the ancient discipline of the Romans can be introduced into an Army made
up of such a medly of wickedness.


Cosimo.
What way is to be taken?


Fabritio.
That which I recommended before, which is to choose out of your own Sub|jects,
and to exercise your authority in your choice.


Cosimo.
If your election be made in that manner, can any ancient form be intro|duced?


Fabritio.
You know it may, if it be in a Kingdom, and he who command be their
Prince, or lawful Soveraign; and if in a Commonwealth it is the same, so he be a great
Citizen, and made General for that time, otherwise it is no easie matter to do any thing
that shall succeed.


Cosimo.
Why Sir?


Fabritio.
I shall tell you that hereafter, at present this may suffice, that no good is to
be done any other way


Cosimo.
Well then, these Levies being to be made in your own Territory, is it best to
make them in the Cities or Country?



CHAP. VI.
Whether it be best to choose you men out of the Cities, or Country.

Fabritio.
THose Authors who have writ any thing of this Nature, do agree unanimously
that the best choice is in the Country where they are inur'd to difficulty and
labour; acquainted more with the Sun than the shade, accustomed to the Spade and the
Plough, and to carry burdens, without any shifting, or mutiny. But Because our Armies
do consist of Horse as well as Foot, my advice is, that the Horse be raised in the Cities, and
the Foot in the Country.


Cosimo.
Of what age would you choose them?


Fabritio.
Were I to raise a new Army, I would choose them betwixt seventeen, and
forty; were I only to recruit an old one, I would have them always of seventeen.


Cosimo.
I do not well understand your distinction.


Fabritio.
I will tell you, were I to raise an Army, or settle a Militia where there was
none before, it would be necessary to make choice of the most apt and experienced that I
could find (provided their age was sutable to the War) to instruct them as I shall direct.
But if I were to raise men to recruit and reinforce an Army that was grown weak, I would
take none above seventeen, because those who are there already will be able to teach them.


Cosimo.
You would order your Militia then, as ours is ordered with us.


Fabritio.
You say well but I would Arm, and Officer, and exercise, and Order them
in a way I know not whether you be acquainted with in your Country.


Cosimo.
Then you are for Train'd Souldiers.


Fabritio.
Why would you have me blame them?


Cosimo.
Because several wise men have always condemn'd them.


Fabritio.
I think you are in a mistake to say a wise man can be against training of Soul|diers:
a man may be thought wise, ('tis possible) and be no such thing.


Cosimo.
The ill success which those Trained-bands have always had, is a great argument
of the truth of that opinion.


Fabritio.
Have a care the fault was not more in you, than in them; of which perhaps
you may be convinced before I have done my discourse.


Cosimo.
You will do us a very great favour. But I will tell you first, in what it is this
Militia is condemn'd, that you may afterwards justifie it the better.




CHAP. VII.
Of the inconvenience, and convenience of Trained-Bands
or a settled Militia.

Cosimo.
IT is objected that either they are experienced and useless, and then to rely upon
them is to ruine the State. Or else they are ready and skilful, and strong, and
then, he who has the command of them may do what he pleases. They instance in the
Romans, who lost their liberty by these kind of men. They instance likewise in the Vene+tian,
and the King of France; the first of which makes use only of foreign Arms, lest some
time or other, they should fall under the subjection of some of their Citizens: and the latter
has disarmed his Subjects, with the more ease to keep them under command. But those
who are against these Trained-Bands, are more fearful when they are raw, and inexpe|rienced
than otherwise, and to this purpose they give two considerable reasons. One
is, because they are unskilful, the other is, because they are unwilling, and they say, that
people any thing in years, never learn any thing well; and a man never does good when
he is forced to the Wars.


Fabritio.
The reasons which you have alledged, are produced only by persons who
understand things at a distance, as I shall demonstrate plainly. And first as to their unser|viceableness,
I say, there are no Souldiers more useful than ones own Subjects, and no Sub|jects
can be ordered a better way. And this being clear, and indisputable, I will not spend
time in proving it farther, because I have the concurrence of all ancient History to confirm
it. As to the inexperience and force wherewith they are charged, I say (and it is true)
that, inexperience makes a man cowardly, and force makes a man Mutinous; but courage
and experience both are infused into them by arming, and exercising, and accommodating
them well, as shall be shown in my following discourse. But as to the point of force, you
must know that such persons as are raised by the command of a Prince, are neither to be
altogether press'd, nor altogether Voluntiers; because to have them altogether Voluntiers,
would be to incur the inconveniences which I have mentioned before; it would not be a
fair election, and there would be very few go a long with you, and wholly to force them,
would be as dangerous on the other side: therefore a middle way is to be taken, neither
too forcible on the one side, nor too frank on the other, but such a one as may tempt them
to the War out of their respect to their Prince, whose displeasure they fear above all other
punishments; such a course as this, tempered so cunningly betwixt fair means and foul,
cannot be dangerous, nor produce that discontent and mutiny which occasions so much mis|chief.
I do not say that an army so chosen and exercised, is absolutely invincible, for the
Roman Armies were many times overcome; and Hannibal's Army was defeated; wherefore
an Army cannot be so ordered and disciplin'd, that one may promise himself it shall never
be broken. The wise men therefore of whom you speak, are not to calculate the uselesness
of an Army, from the loss of one Battle, but are rather to believe that having miscarried
once, they will be more cautious afterwards, and do something (as occasion offers) to ex|piate
their disgrace: and if the business should be thorowly examined, it would not be
found to be the defect of the form so much, as want of perfection in their Order And
this (as I said before) is to be provided against, not by blaming, or exploding the way of
train'd men, but by improving and correcting it where it shall be found amiss; and how
that is done, I will show you particularly. As to your doubt that such an order of Souldiers,
meeting with an Officer equally disposed, may usurp upon you, and turn you out of your
Government; I answer, that Arms put orderly and legally into the hands of Citizens or
Subjects never did, nor will do any harm. And Cities are kept longer innocent and in|corrupt
with those, than any other forces, nay than they are commonly without them.
Rome had its Citizens in Arms four hundred years together, and yet kept its liberty intire;
Sparta preserved its liberty 800 years in the same posture; several Cities have been dis|armed,
and kept their liberties: but how long? Not forty years any of them, and the reason
is, because great Cities have occasion for Soldiers, and when they have none of their own,
they are forced to entertain Strangers which commonly do much more mischief than their
own, for they are more easily debauched, and a popular Citizen may more easily corrupt
and employ them as Instruments of Usurpation and Tyranny, when they have nothing but
naked, and unarmed people to destroy. Besides, a City ought in reason to be more fearful
of two Enemies than one. For in entertaining of Strangers, a City is to have an eye over
her Mercenaries and her Natives; and to prove that this jealousie is natural and reasonable,

remember what I said before of Francis Sforza; whereas a City which employs only her
own inhabitants, fears nobody else. But to use one reason for all, let me tell you, no man
ever established a Commonwealth, or Kingdom, who did not believe that the inhabitants
(if arm'd) would be willing to defend it.
And had the Venetians been as wise in this, as other Counsels, they would have set up
a new Monarchy in the World; and they are the more inexcusable that have not, be|cause
their first Legislators put arms into their hands, and gave them ability to defend
themselves. But their territory being little at land, they employed their arms only at Sea,
where they performed many great things, to the enlargement of their Country. But in
process of time, being forced to take arms by land for the relief of vicenza, they enter|tained
the Marquess of Mantoua into their service, and made him their General, whereas
they should rather have committed that charge to one of their own Citizens, and
sent him to have engaged the enemy at land. This unhappy resolution was that which
clip'd the wings of their success, and kept them from extending their Empire; if they
did it out of an opinion that their experience was not so great in Land as in Sea affairs,
their diffidence was imprudent; for a Sea Captain accustomed to the conflicts of the
Winds and the Water, and the elements, and the enemy, shall sooner make a good Land-Officer,
where he has nothing to fight with but men; than a Land-Officer shall make a good
Captain at Sea. My Country-men the Romans who were so knowing at Land, being at
wars with the Carthaginian that was so potent at Sea; never troubled themselves to enter|tain
either Grecian or Spaniard into their service, though they were both so good Souldiers
at Sea, but they committed that charge to their Land-Officers, who fought the Carthagi|nians,
and beat them. If the Venetians did it to prevent the usurpation of any of their
fellow Citizens, I think it was an unnecessary fear; for (besides the reasons aforesaid) if a
Citizen with his Sea-forces never made himself Master of any Sea Town, he could have
done it much less with any Land-force. So that hence it may be seen that is is not putting
the Citizens in arms, that is the cause of tyranny; but ill order, and ill management in
the Government; for whilst good order is preserved, there is no danger of their being
arm'd, wherefore their resolution in that point being imprudent, has rob'd them of much
reputation and happiness. And as to the King of France's error in not keeping his sub|jects
in discipline, and prepared for the Wars, which is by you urged for an example, there
is no body (laying aside his private passion) but must conclude that single neglect to be a
great weakness to his Kingdom.
But my digression has been too great, and perhaps beyond my design, yet I have done it
the more willingly to demonstrate to you that foreign force is not to be relied upon so much
as ones own subjects; nor can ones own subjects be prepared and adapted for the Wars
any way so well, as by training and exercise. Nor can there be any better way of forming
an army, or establishing a Militia in any place than that which I have prescribed. If you
have read the orders of the first Roman Kings, especially of Servius Tullis, you will
find his orders like ours, and driving at nothing more than putting the Citizens into such
a posture, that upon any emergence they might be brought suddenly together, and form'd
into an army for the defence of the City.



CHAP. VIII.
Of what sort of people an army is to be composed.

Fabritio.
BUt to return to our levies, I say again, that being to recruit and old Army, I
would choose my men of about seventeen; but to raise a new one that
might be made fit for service in a short time, I would take in any betwixt seventeen and
forty.


Cosimo
Would you in your election make any difference of their trades?


Fabritio.
Many Authors which have written on that subject, have made a difference
of their trades, and will not allow of Faulconers, Fowlers, Fishers, Ruffians, or any per|sons
who make sports their profession, or are in any manner subservient to pleasure: those
who they recommend to be chosen, are Labourers, Husband-men, Smiths, Farriers, Car|penters,
Butchers, Huntsmen, and the like. But for my own part, I should not so much
consider the quality of the profession, as the goodness of the man, and which way he may
be employed with most advantage. For this reason I think your Plough-men, and Day-labourers
in the Country are more useful Generally than any other; for they take more

pains, and do more service in an Army than all the rest. After them are your Smiths,
Farriers, Carpenters, Joyners, and such people to be chosen; of which sort it is conveni|ent
to have good store, because their arts are usefull in an Army upon several occasions: and
'tis a good thing to have Souldiers who have two strings to theri bow, and yield you double
advantage.


Cosimo,
How are those who are fit, or unfit for the Wars, to be distinguished and
known?


Fabritio
I shall speak of the manner of choosing a Militia to form it afterwards into
an Army, because we shall have occasion again of speaking of the election to be made up|on
the recruiting of an old Army. I say therefore that the fitness of a person to be cho|sen
for the Wars, is to be known by experience, (in some great atchievment) or by conje|cture.
This proof and tryal of their courage is not to be found among new raised men, it is
necessary therefore where this experience is not to be had, to have recourse to conjecture,
which is to be deduced from their age, arts, and stature. Of the two first we have spoken
before; it remains that we speak now of the third, and tell you, that some persons (as
Pyrrhus) have been altogether for large and tall men. Others (as Caesar) would have
them strong, well knit, and vigorous, which is to be judged by the composition of their
members, and the quickness of their aspect. Wherefore those who treat of that subject,
have recommended a lively and quick eye, a nervous neck, a large breast, a musculous arm,
a long finger, a small belly, round and firm thighs, and thin feet, this kind of contexture
does always import activity and strength, which in a Souldier are two things principally
to be desired. But above all respect is to be had to their manners and that they be indued
with honesty, and modesty, otherwise you choose an instrument of scandal, and a begin|ning
of corruption; for no body can expect, that with brutishness and dishonesty, any
laudable virtue should consist. Upon this occasion it seems to me not impertinent (for your
better understanding the importance of this way of election) to let you know the man|ner
in which the Roman Consuls in the begining of their Magistracy made their elections
for the Roman Legions. In which levies (by reason of their continual Wars) being mix'd
of new and Veteran Souldiers, they could proceed in the Veterans by experience, and by
conjecture in the new. You must know then, these levies were made either for present
service, or to exercise them first, and employ them afterwards as occasion was offered.
And although I have spoken already of what is to be observed in the election of such as
are to be disciplin'd and employed afterwards, yet my intention being to shew how an Ar|my
may be ordered in a Country where there is no military discipline, and where men are
not to be raised for immediate service, I shall speak of it further. But in those Countries
where it is the custom to raise Forces by the Princes command, there they may have them
always ready for present service, as it was anciently in Rome, and is among the Swizzars at
this day. For if in these kind of levies there be new Souldiers, there are many which are
old and experienced, which mingled with the new, will make a good Army. Notwith|standing
this, the Emperors (after they began to keep standing Forces and Garisons upon
the Frontiers) appointed Masters for the training and instructing their new men whom
they called Tyrones, as may be seen in the life of Maximus the Emperor. Which custom
was not practised in the Armies whilst Rome enjoyed her liberty, but only in the City in
which those military exercises being much used by the youth, it came to pass, that being
drawn out for the Wars, they were so well versed and experienced in that counterfeit disci|pline,
that when afterwards they came to it in earnest, they behaved themselves very well.
But when by degrees the Emperors disused or abolished that custom of training, they were
constrained to these ways which I have shewn you before.



CHAP. IX
How the Romans raised their Legions.
TO proceed therefore to the manner of the election of the Roman Legions, I say, that
after the Roman Consuls (in whose hands the administration of the war was wholly
deposited) had taken upon them the Magistracy, being to raise an Army accord|ing
to custom, which gave to each Consul two Legions of the Best men, (who were esteemed
the strength and flower of their Army) they created four and twenty military Tribunes, (six
for each Legion) and invested them with the same authority as we do our Captains. Af|ter

this they assembled all the Romans who were able to bear arms, and place the Tri|bunes
of each Legion a part; after which they drew lots in which Tribe they should be|gin
their election, and where the lot fell, out of that Tribe they chose four of the best, and
out of them four, and one was chosen by the Tribunes of the first Legion; and out of the
other three, one was chosen by the second Legion; and out of the remaining two, another
was chosen by the third Legion; and the fourth person belonged to the fourth Legion:
these four being disposed in this manner, they proceeded to the election of four more, the
first of which was chosen by the Tribunes of the second Legion; the second by the Tri|bunes
of the third; the third by the fourth, and the fourth by the first Legion. After
which they had a third election; the first chose the third; the second the fourth; the third
the first; and the fourth the second: and in this manner they varied their elections, till at
length all the legions became perfect and equal, and were then united. As we said before,
the Romans had the convenience of making this election for present service, because a good
part of such as were chosen, were old Souldiers, well experienced in their trade, and all of
them well disciplin'd and train'd; so that their elections were made by experience, and
conjecture both; but where an Army is to be new raised, and chosen, not so much for
present as future service; the election in that case is to be made by conjecture only,
and that from the age and person of the man.

Cosimo.
I believe what you have said to be true; but before you pass to another
discourse, I would be satisfied in a thing of which you put me in mind, by saying that levies
to be made of such persons as have not been trained up in the wars, are to be made by con|jecture;
and of this I am the more curious, because I have observed in many places our
Militia's to be condemned, and especially as to our numbers; for many are of opinion a
less number were better, in respect that the fewer there were, the better they would be
taught, and by consequence the elections would be better, the confusion less, and they
would be more capable of reward, (which is that which keeps them content) and to be
sure be under better command. I would know therefore your opinion, whether you are
for a great number or a small, and what measures you would take in your elections both of
the one and the other.



CHAP. X.
Whether it is best for a Militia to consist of a great number or a small.

Fabr.
SEeing it is your desire to be satisfied, which is best, a great number or a small; with|out
doubt a great number is best, and not only more necessary, but (to keep frank|ly)
a compleat  perfect Militia is not to be had in any place where there is not great plenty
of men; and as to your observation in other places, it is easily refused. For first, the smal|ness
of your number does not better your souldiers, (where plenty is to be had, as in
Tuscany) nor mend your election; because men being to judge by experience, in that Coun|try
few people would be found whose experience would recommend them; forasmuch as
few of them have been actually in the wars; and of those few, fewer have given such te|stimony
of themselves as to deserve to be chosen before the rest; so that he who makes
his election in such places, is to lay aside his experience, and to choose by way of conje|cture.
Other people therefore being in this perplexity, I would know, if twenty young
persons of good aspects were brought before me, by what rules or method I was to choose
or reject. I do not doubt but every man would confess the best way, to take, and arm, and
exercise them all, (it being impossible to judge till then which will be the best) and to reserve
your election, till having all had the same exercise, and instruction, it be easie to discern
which is most vigorous, and likely to do service: so that upon the whole, to desire but few
in this case, that your election may be better, is without question an error. As to the ob|jection
of being less inconvenience to the Country, and to the people, I answer that a
Militia (be it as little or imperfect as it may) is no prejudice to either. Because it takes
away no man from his employments; obliges no man from his business; for to appear on|ly
on idle days to exercise, is rather a recreation to the People, and advantage to the Coun|try,
than otherwise. Whereas if they had no such divertisement, and young men would
be apt on those days to run out into some debauchery, or extravagance, which would be
much worse than those innocent recreations, which being a handsome spectacle, gives great
entertainments to young people.

Whereas it is alledged that a less number is easier paid, and by consequence kept in bet|ter
order and obedience; I answer, That no Levies can be made of so few, as that they
will be paid always to their satisfaction. For example, a Militia is to be established of
five thousand foot: To pay them to their content would require at least 10000 Ducats a
month. First, 5000 Foot is not a competent Army, and 10000 Ducats a month would
be insupportable to a State, and yet insufficient to satisfie them, or to oblige them to any
extraordinary enterprize. So that in so doing, your expence would be great, your force
but small, and unable to defend you, much less to make any vigorous attack. If you en|crease
their pay, or their number, it would be the more impossible to pay them: if
you gave them less, or listed less, they would be so much the more dissatisfied, and
unserviceable.
They therefore who talk of raising Soldiers, and paying them whilst they are not in
service, talk ridiculously, and of things either impossible or useless. 'Tis true, when they
are to be raised for immediate Service, they are always to be paid; yet if in times of Peace
they be the occasion of any disorder or inconvenience, (which I cannot believe) the advan|tages
of a well disciplin'd and ready Militia does abundantly recompence it; for where
there is no such force, there is nothing secure.
I conclude then, That he who would have a small number, to pay them the better, or
for any other of your reasons, is mightily ignorant. for though it agrees with my opi|nion,
that let your number be what it will, it will lessen upon your hands, (by the many
accidents that are not possible to be avoided) yet a small number would quickly dwindle to
nothing: Besides, a great number is of more real service and reputation. To this it may
be added, That if in order to the exercising, you select a few persons in Countries where
plenty is to be had; they are so remote, and at such distance from on another, that you
cannot bring them to a Rendezvouz without great inconvenience; and without exercising,
Militia's are useless, as shall be shown in due place.


Cosimo.
You have satisfied me as to my former demand, but I desire you would resolve
me another doubt? and that is whether such great numbers do not produce more confusion
and disorder in the Country.


Fabritio.
That opinion is as idle as the other, and for the reasons I shall give.



CHAP. XI.
How the inconveniencies. which follow great Armies may be prevented.

Fabritio.
THose who are designed for the Wars, may occasion disorder two ways, either
among themselves, or with other people; but the remedy is easie, though
their discipline should not prevent it (for as to quarrels and mutinies among themselves,
discipline will obviate them) If the Country where your Levies are to be made, be so weak,
that they have no Arms among them, or so unanimously united among themselves, that
they have no head, this Order and Militia will make them more fierce and couragious
against Strangers, without any impediment to their unity, For men who are well disci|plin'd,
are as tender of breaking the Laws when they are Armed, as much as when they
are disarmed, nor can they be any ways altred, unless the Officers which you set over them
debauch them, and which way that is to be done, I shall shew you presently. But if the
Country where your Levies are to be made, are in Arms, and disunited, this way will be
sufficient to unite them; for though they had Arms and Officers of their own before, yet
they were such Arms as were useless in War, and such Officers as rather bred and provoked
mutinies, than prevented or suppress'd them. And the reason is because in those Coun|tries
as soon as a man is offended, he repairs immediately to the head of his party, who to
maintain his own reputation, encourages him to revenge; whereas a publick General
proceeds quite contrary. So then by this way Seditions are prevented, Unity established,
Provinces united (but weak) continue their union, and are freed of their weakness: Pro|vinces
disunited and mutinous, are reconciled and composed, and their ferocity which
was employed formerly in disorders, is employed now to the advantage of the publick.
As to the provision that is to be made that they injure not other people, it is to be consi|dered
that that is not to be done, but by the fault of their Officers; and to prevent the
Officers from oocasioning such disorders, it is necessary that care be taken that they do not
usurp too great an authority over their Soldiers, which authority is to be gained two ways
either by nature, or accident; the way by nature, is to be prevented by providing that he

who is born in a place, be never put to command the Forces raised in the same place, but
be put at the head of such Troops as are raised in other Countries, with whom he has no
natural converse. As to the accidental way, things are to be so ordered, that the Com|manders
in chief be changed every year; for the continuation of a command over the
same men, contracts such a friendship and intimacy betwixt them, as is many times per|verted
to the prejudice of the Prince. Which changes, how useful they have been to those
who have used them, and how much the omission of them have been prejudicial to other
people, may be observed by the example of the Kingdom of Assyria; and the Empire of
the Romans; for that Kingdom continued a thousand years without Tumult or civil War,
which proceeded from the annual changing of the Officers of the Army. And in the
Roman Empire, after Iulius Caesar was killed, all the civil Wars; and Conspiracies which
hapned betwixt the Officers and the Emperors, proceeded from nothing but holding the
Officers continually in command. And if any of the first Emperors, or those who rul'd
afterwards with any reputation (as Adrianus, Marcus, Severus and the like) had had the
providence to have introduced that custom into their Armies, without doubt their Empire
would have been more quiet and durable; for their Generals would not have had so much
opportunity to rebel, the Emperors would not have had so much occasion to for, and the
Senate (in default of succession) having more authority in the election of a new Emperor,
would undoubtedly have chosen better. But ill customs (either thorow the ignorance, or
inadvertancy of mankind) are not to be eradicated by examples either good or bad.


Cosimo.
I fear my demands have drawn you from your intended discourse, for from
speaking of Levies and Militia's, and such things, we are got clear upon another Subject;
so that had I not excused my self before, I should think I deserved reprehension.


Fabritio.
Let not that trouble you, all that we have said is pertinent enough, for being
to treat of the way of Militia's (which is condemned by many people) and I to defend it,
was convenient that we should begin with the way of Election; and first as to the
Cavalry.



CHAP. XII.
Of the Cavalry:

Fab.
THe Cavalry anciently was raised out of the richest and most considerable of the
City, but with respect to the age, and quality of the person. Of these there
were only three hundred to a Legion; so that in each Consular Army, the Romans had
never above six hundred Horse.


Cosimo.
Would you have a standing Militia of Horse to exercise them at home, and
employ them afterwards in the War?


Fab.
To do well you cannot do otherwise, if you would have Soldiers of your own
and not rely wholly upon such as make War their profession.


Cosimo.
How would you choose them?


Fab.
I would imitate the Romans, choose them out of the wealthiest, give Officers
as they do at this day, and see them well armed, and well exercised.


Cosimo.
Would it be well to allow them any pay?


Fab.
Yes truly it would, yet it should be no more than would keep their Horse; for
otherwise lying continually upon them, they would become grievous to the Subject, and
give them occasion to complain of you.


Cosimo.
What numbers would you have, and how would you Arm them?


Fab.
You are too quick, and pass from one thing to another; I'll answer you to that
in another place, when I have told you how the Foot are to be Armed, and prepared for
a field Battel.





THE SECOND
BOOK.

CHAP. I.
What arms were most used by the Ancients in their Wars.

Fabr.
WHen you have raised your men, the next thing is to furnish them with Arms,
and before you do that, I think it not amiss to examine what Arms were
most used by the Ancients, and choose the best. The Romans divided their
Infantry into those who were compleatly, and those who were slightly armed. Those who
were lightly armed, were called Velites, under which name all were comprehended who car|ried
Bows, and Slings, and Darts; the greatest part of them had Casques upon their heads
for their defence, and a kind of Buckler upon their arm. They fought in no order, and at
distance from those who were arm'd compleatly; Their Arms consisted of a Head-piece or
Morrion which came down to the Shoulders, a Brigandine down to their knees, their legs
and arms were covered with Greeves, and Gauntlets, a Buckler covered with Iron, about two
yards long, and one broad, an Iron ring about it without to keep off the blows, and another
within to keep it from the dirt when it was lay'd upon the ground. Their offensive
Weapons were a Sword at their left thigh, about a yard and half long, with a Dagger on
their right side. They carried a Dart in their hand which they called Pilum, which upon a
a Charge they darted at the Enemy.
These were the Arms with which the Romans conquered the whole world. And though
some of their ancient Writers do give them a Spear in form of a Spit; I do not see how
such a Weapon could be handled by one that carried such a Buckler, for it was too heavy to
be managed with one hand; besides (unless it were in the Front where they had room to
make use of them) it was impossible to use them in their ranks; for the nature of Battels is
such (as I shall show hereafter) that they do always contract and keep close, as being in
much less danger, than when they are drawn up looser and at a distance: So that in that
close order, all Arms that are above two yards long, are not to be used, for having a Spear
that is to be managed with both hands, if your Buckler were no hinderance, it could not
hurt your Enemy when he was near. If you take it in one hand, and manage your Buckler
with the other, you must take it in the middle, and then there will be so much of it be|hind,
that they who come after you will hinder you from handling it: So that it is true,
either the Romans had no such Hastae, or if they had, they made but little use of them.
For if you read the History of Titus Livius, in the description of all his Battels, you will
scarce ever find he mentions those Hastae, but tells you all along that having dared their
Pila, they fell to the Sword. My opinion therefore is, that this Hasta be lay'd aside, and
that in imitation of the Romans we make use of their Sword and Buckler, and other Arms,
without troubling our selves with that.
The Grecians for their defence did not arm so heavily as the Romans but for offence,
they relyed more upon the Spear, than the Sword, especially the Macedonian Phalanx, who
carried of those Javelins which they called Sarissae, with which they brake the Enemies
Battels, and kept their own firm and entire. And though some Writers say that they also
had their Bucklers, (yet I know not (for the reasons abovesaid) how they could consist.
Besides, in the Battel betwixt Paulus Emilius and Perseus King of Macedon, I do not remem|ber
that any mention was made of any-Bucklers, but only of their Sarissae, and yet the
Romans had much ado to overcome them. So that my opinion is, the Macedonian Pha|lanx
was just such a Body as the Swizzers Battalion; whose whole force lyes in their
. The Romans were likewise accustomed to adorn their Soldiers with Plumes of Fea|thers
in their Caps, which renders an Army beautiful to their Friends, and terrible to their

Enemies. In the first beginning of the Roman Wars, their Horse used a round Shield,
a Helmet upon their Heads, and all the rest of their body naked; their offensive Arms
were a Sword and Javelin with a long thin spike at the end of it; and so being incum|bered
with Shield and Javelin, they could use neither of them well, and being unarmed,
they were more exposed to the Enemy.
Afterwards they came to arm themselves like their Foot, only their Shield was a little
shorter, and squarer, their Launce or Javelin thicker, with pikes at each end, that if by
accident one of them should miscarry, the other might be serviceable. With these Arms
both for Horse and Foot, my Country-men the Romans went thorow the whole world,
and by the greatness of their successes, 'tis likely they were as well accounted as any
Army ever was. And Titus Livius in many places of his History makes it credible where
comparing the Armies of the Enemies, says, But the Romans for courage, fashion of their
Arms, and discipline were before them all. And for that reason I have chosen to speak
particularly rather of the Conqueror's Arms, than the Arms of the Conquered. It fol|lows
now that I say something of the way of Arming at present.



CHAP. II.
Of the Arms which are used at present, and of the invention of the Pike.

Fabritio.
THe Soldiers of our times do wear for defensive Arms, Back and Breast,
and for offensive a Launce nine yards long, which they call a Pike, with
a Sword by their side rather round than sharp. These are generally the Arms which they
wear at this day, few wear Greaves and Gantlets, and none at all Head-pieces. Those
few who have no Pikes, do carry Halbards, the staff three yards long, and the head like
an Axe. They have among them Musquetiers, who with their Fire Arms do the same
Service which was done formerly by the Bows and Slings. This manner of arming with
Pikes, was found out by the Germans, and particularly by the Swizzers, who being poor,
and desirous to preserve their liberty, were and are still necessitated to contend against the
ambition of the Princes of Germany who are rich, and able to entertain Horse, which the
Swizzers are not able to do. So that their Force consisting principally in Foot, being to
defend themselves against the Enemies Horse, they were obliged to revive the old way of
drawing up, and find out Arms that might defend them against them. This necessity put
them upon continuing, or reviving the old Orders, without which (as every wise-man
knows) the Foot would be useless; for which cause they make use of Pikes not only to
resist and keep off, but to attack and sometimes to disorder the Horse. And by vertue of
these Arms,, and these Orders, the Germans have assumed the confidence with 15 or
20000 of their Foot to attack a vast Body of Horse, of which 'tis not above 25 years since
we had a most signal experiment; and so many great examples there are of their courage
(founded upon their Arms, and their Order) that after Charles VIII's Expedition into
Italy, all Nations made use of them, insomuch as thereby the Spaniards grew into great
reputation.


Cosimo.
Which manner of arming do you prefer, the German, or the ancient
Roman.


Fabritio.
The Roman without doubt, and I will tell you the usefulness and inconve|nience
of them both.



CHAP. III.
Whether the ancient, or modern is the best way of Arming.
THe German Foot are able not only to sustain, but to beat the Cavalry, they are better
for expedition, and can draw themselves up better, because not over pestered with
Arms. On the other side Foot are more exposed to wounds both at hand and at a distance.
They are not so useful likewise in Storming of Towns, and are in great danger where
there is vigorous resistance. But the Romans were so well armed, they could encounter
and baffle the Horse as well as the Germans, and were secure against their blows by vertue
of their Arms, could manage themselves better in an engagement with their Swords, than

the Germans with their Pikes, and assault a Town better under the shelter of their Targets.
So that the only inconvenience was the weight of their Arms, and the trouble of carrying
them along, which they easily surmounted by accustoming themselves to all kind of diffi|culties
and hardships, and you know custom is a second Nature. You must know like|wise
that Foot are many times to engage both against Horse and Foot together, and consider
also that these kind of Soldiers would be altogether unserviceable, and could never stand
against Horse; or if they could bear up against them, yet they would still be afraid of the
Foot, lest they should be better armed, and better ordered than they. Now if you consider
the Romans and Germans together you will questionless discover that the Germans had much
the advantage in charging and breaking a body of Horse (as we said before) but to en|gage
a Body of Foot armed, and ordered like the Romans, they have much the disadvan|tage.
So that by this you see what advantage and disadvantage, the one has of the other,
the Romans were able to fight Foot and Horse both, and the Germans are able to deal only
with Horse.

Cosimo.
I would desire you to give us an example, that we may understand it the
better.


Fabritio.
I say you will find in many places of our History, the Roman Foot have over|come
great Bodies of Horse, and you shall never find that they were overcome by Foot, by
reason of any defect in their Arms, or any advantage which the Enemy had in theirs. For
had their way of arming been found inconvenient, one of these two things would have
followed, they would not have advanced with their Conquests so far (their Enemy being
better arm'd,) or else they would have arm'd as the Enemy did, and left their own way;
and because neither the one nor the other was done, it follows probably that their way of
arming was the best. With the Germans it was otherwise as appears by the ill success which
they have had whenever they have been engaged with Foot that were well ordered, and as
valiant as they; which proceeded from the advantage the Enemy had of them in their
Arms. Philippo Visconte Duke of Milan being assaulted by 18000 Swizzers, sent against
them the Count Carmignuola, who was his General at that time. Carmignuola, with 6000
Horse, and a few Foot went to encounter them, and coming to an engagement, was beaten
for his pains. Carmignuola being a wise man, quickly discovered the advantage which the
Enemy had in their Foot over his Horse, having rallyed and recruited his Army, he ad|vanced
against the Swissers again, and when he came near them, he caused his Horse to dis|mount,
and engaging them smartly in that posture, he put them all to the rout, and most
of them to the Sword, only 3000 were left, who finding themselves past remedy, threw
down their Arms.


Cosimo.
How comes that great disadvantage?


Fabritio.
I told you before, but since you did not regard it, I will repeat it again. The
German Infantry have little or no defensive Arms, and for offensive they have the Pike and
the Sword, and with these weapons, and in that order they attack the Enemy. But if the
Enemy be well provided for his defence (as the Cavalry were which Carmignuola caused to
dismount) and receives them in any good order, they may deal well enough with the
Swizzers if they can but come to the Sword; for when they once get within them, the
length of their Pikes make them useless, and falling then to their Sword, they have the
disadvantage of wanting defensive Arms, with which the Enemy is provided. So that
considering the advantage and disadvantage on both sides, it will appear that they who
have no defensive Arms are without remedy if the Enemy charges but home, and passes
their Pikes; for Battels do always advance (as I shall show, when I have told you their
manner of drawing up) and pressing on prepetually, they must of necessity come so near
as to reach one another with their Swords, and though some few perhaps may be killed or
tumbled down with their Pikes, yet those that are behind pressing still on, are sufficient to
carry the Victory, and this was the reason why Carmignuola overcame with so great slaugh|ter
of the Swisses, and so little of his own Army.


Cosimo.
Considering that Carmignuola's Forces were men at Arms, and (though on
foot) yet armed compleatly, in my judgment it would be convenient upon any great en|terprize,
to arm your Foot in that manner.


Fabritio.
Had you remembred what I told you before about the way of the Romans
arming themselves, you would not have been of that opinion: For a Foot Soldier with a
Head-piece, Breast-plate, Shield, his arms and his legs covered with Iron, is better able to
defend himself against the Pikes, and break into them, than one of the men at Arms
dismounted.
I will give you a modern example Certain Companies of Spanish Foot were transported
out of Sicily, and landed in the Kingdom of Naples, being to supply Gonsalvo, who was

besieged in Barletta by the French. Monsieur d' Aubigny had notice of their march, and
went to meet them with his men at arms, and some 4000 German foot, who pressed upon
them with their pikes, and opened the Spanish body, but by the help of their bucklers,
and the agility of their bodies, having got under their pikes, and so near as that they could
come at them with their swords, the Spaniards had the day with the slaughter of most of
the Swisses. Everyone knows how many of the Swisses foot were cut off at the battel
of Ravenna, and all upon the same account, the Spanish foot having got to them with
their swords, and had cut them certainly in pieces, had they not been rescued by the
French horse: and yet the Spaniards drawing themselves into a close Order, secured them|selves.
I conclude therefore, a good Infantry ought to be able not only to sustain the horse,
but to encounter the foot, which (as I have said many times before) is to be done by be|ing
well arm'd and well ordered.


Cosimo.
Tell me therefore, I beseech you, how you would have them arm'd?



CHAP. IV.
How foot should be arm'd, and of the force and convenience of men at Arms.

Fabritio.
I Would take both of the Roman and German arms, and half my men should be
arm'd with the one, and half with the other; for if in 6000 foot (as I shall
explain to you hereafter) I should have 3000 with bucklers like the Romans, 2000 pikes,
and 1000 muskets, like the Swiss; I think I should do well enough; for I would place
my pikes either in my front, or where-ever I suspected the Enemies horse might make any
impression; my bucklers and swords should second my pikes, and be very conducing to
the Victory, as I shall demonstrate. So that I think an Infantry thus ordered would be too
hard for any other.


Cosimo.
What you have said about the Foot, is sufficient. I pray let us now hear what
you judge of the horse, and which way of equipping them is the best, the ancient, or mo|dern.


Fabr.
I think the present way is the best, in respect of the great saddles and stirrups,
(which were not in use among the ancients) and make men sit stronger and firmer upon
their horse. I think our way of arming now is more secure, and a body of our horse will
make a greater impression than a body of the old. Yet I am of opinion that Cavalry are
not to be more esteemed now than of old, because (as I have said) they have in our days
been oft worsted by the foot, and so they always will be, if the foot be arm'd and ordered
as abovesaid. Tigranes King of Armenia came into the field against the Roman Army,
under the command of Lucullus, with 150000 horse, many of them arm'd like our men at
arms, (which they called Catafracti) the Romans consisting only of 6000 horse, and 15000
foot. Whereupon, in contempt of their number, when Tigranes saw them, he said, That
they were liker the Train of an Embassador than an Army. Nevertheless when they came to
fight, he was beaten, and he who writes the story, blames the Catafracti, and declares them
unserviceable; for (says he) having Beavers over their faces, they cannot so well see how
to offend the Enemy, and being laden with arms, if by accident their horse be killed, or
throws them upon the ground, they cannot get up again, nor help themselves in any man|ner.
I say then, that Nation or Kingdom which prefers their horse to their foot, shall al|ways
be weak, and in danger of ruine, as Italy has experimented in our time, having been
exposed to ruine and depredation by strangers, for want of foot, which has been very
much neglected, and all the Souldiers set on horse-back. Not but it is good to have horse
too, yet not to make them the strength of their Army, but sufficient to second the foot;
for they are of great use for scouting, making inroads into the Enemies Country, raising
Contributions, infesting the Enemy, and cutting off Convoys and supplies of Provisions;
nevertheless when they come to a Field-fight, which is the main importance of a War, and
the very end for which Armies are raised they are not so serviceable as foot, though indeed
in a rout they are better to pursue.


Cosimo.
I cannot concur with you in this for two reasons, one is, the Parthians used
nothing but horse, and yet they had their share of the World as well as the Romans; and
the other is, because I cannot see which way the Cavalry can be sustained by the Foot, and
from whence proceeds the strength of the one, and the weakness of the other.


Fabr.
I think I have told you, or else I will tell you now, that my discourse of military
affairs shall extend no farther than Europe. Being intended no farther, I do not think my

self obliged to give a reason for their customs in Asia, yet this I may say, that the Parthian
discipline was quite contrary to the Roman; for the Parthians fought always on horse-back
in confusion and disorder, which is a way of fighting very uncertain. The Romans
fought generally on foot, in close and firm order, and they overcame one another variously,
as the place where they fought was open, or streight: in streight places the Romans had the
better; in champian, the Parthians, who were able to do great things in respect of the
Country which they were to defend, it being very large, a thousand miles from the Sea,
not a River sometimes within two or three days march, and Towns and Inhabitants very
thin. So that an Army like the Roman, pestered and incumbred with their arms, and their
order, could not pass thorow the Country without great loss, by reason the strength of the
Enemy consisted in horse which were nimble, here to day, and to morrow fifty miles off.
And this may be a reason why the Parthians prevailed with their horse, ruined the Army
of Crassus, and put Marc Anthony into so much danger. But as I said before, my intention
is not to speak any thing of the Armies out of Europe, and therefore I shall insist only upon
the Romans, the Grecians, and the Germans.



CHAP. V.
The difference betwixt men at Arms and foot, and upon which we are
most to rely.

Fabr.
WE come now to your other demand, in which you desire to understand
what order, or what natural virtue it is that makes the foot better than the
horse.
I say in the first place, horse cannot march in all Countries as foot can; they are not so
ready to obey orders when there is any sudden occasion to change them: for when they
are upon their march, if there be occasion to wheel, or face about, to advance, or stop, or
retreat, they cannot do it with that dexterity as the foot. Upon any rout or disorder,
horse cannot rally so well, (though perhaps they are not pursued) which is not so with the
foot.
Again, it is frequently seen, a brave and a daring man may be upon a bad horse, and a
coward upon a good, and that inequality is the occasion of many disorders. Nor let any
one think strange that a body of foot can sustain the fury of the horse, because an horse is
a sensible creature, and being apprehensive of danger, is not easily brought into it. And if
it be considered what forces them on, and what forces them off, it will be found that that
which keeps them off, is greater than that which pricks them on; for that which puts them
forward is but a spur, whilst that which keeps them off, is a pike or a sword. So that it has
been many times seen both by ancient and modern experience, that a body of foot are se|cure,
and insuperable by horse. If you object, that coming on galloping to the charge,
makes the horse rush furiously upon the Enemy, and to be less careful of the pike than the
spur. I answer, that though a horse be in his career, when he sees the pikes, he will stop
of himself; and when he feels them prick, he will stop short; and when you press him
on, will turn either on the one side or the other: and if you have a mind to make the ex|periment,
try if you can to run a horse against a wall, and you shall find very few
that will do it. Caesar, when he was in France, being to fight a battel with the Swizzers,
caused all his horse to dismount, and send their horses away, as being fitter to fly than to
fight upon. But though horse are naturally subject to these impediments, he who com|mands
the foot is to march such ways as are likely to be most difficult for horse, and he shall
scarce come into a Country but such ways are to be found. If you march over mountainous
and hilly places, the very situation will secure you against the fury of the horse; if your
march be in a plain, you will seldom march any where but you will have plow'd-fields, or
hedges, or woods to secure you: for every ditch, every bank, how inconsiderable so ever,
takes off from the fury of the horse, and every plow'd-field or vineyards retards them.
And if you come to a battel, it will be the same as in a march; for every small accident that
happens to a horse, dismays him, and takes off his courage. However, I will not omit to tell
you one thing that the Romans trusted so much to their orders, and arms, that had it been
in their power to have chosen a place that had been sleep, and covenient to secure them
against horse, (though they had not been able to draw themselves up) or an open place
(more obnoxious to the horse) where they might put themselves handsomly in Battalia, they

chose always the last, and rejected the first. But it being time to come now to their man|ner
of exercise, having arm'd our foot according to the ancient and modern way, let us see
what exercise the Romans gave them before they brought them to a Battel.



CHAP. VI.
How the Souldiers were exercised.
THough they be never so well chosen, and never so well arm'd, Souldiers are carefully
to be exercised, for without exercise they are good for nothing. And this exercise
ought to be three-fold, one is to inure them to labour and hardship, and make them dex|terous
and nimble; another to teach them how to handle their arms; and the third to
teach them to keep their ranks and orders in their marches, battels, and encampments:
which are three great things in an Army. For if an Army marches, is drawn up well, and
encamps regularly and skilfully, the General shall gain reputation, let the success be as it
will. Wherefore all ancient Commonwealths provided particularly for these exercises by
their Customs and Laws, so that nothing of that nature was omitted. They exercised
their youth to learn them to be nimble in running, active to leap, strong to throw the bar,
and to wrestle, which are all necessary qualities in a Souldier, for running and numbleness
fits them for possessing a place before the enemy; to fall upon them on a sudden in their
quarters, and pursue with more execution in a rout: activity makes them with more ease
avoid their blows, leap a ditch, or climb a bank; and strength makes them carry their arms
better, strike better, and endure the shock better: and above all to inure them to labour,
they accustomed their Souldiers to carry great weights, which custom is very necessary; for
in great expeditions it happens many times that the Souldiers are forced to carry (besides
their arms) several days provisions, which without being accustomed to labour, would be
more tedious to them, and by this, great dangers are many times avoided, and great victo|ries
many times obtained. As to their way of accustoming them to their arms, they did
it in this manner. They made their young men wear head-pieces twice as heavy as those
which they were to wear in the field, and instead of Swords, they gave Cudgels with lead
run into them, much heavier than their Swords. They caused each of them to fix a pale
into the ground three yards high, and fasten it so strong that no blows might be able to
batter or shake it: against which pale or stake the youth were accustomed to exercise them|selves
with their cudgel or buckler, as it had been an Enemy; striking it sometimes as it
were on the head, sometimes on the face, then on the sides, legs, before and behind; some|times
retreating, and then advancing again: and by this way of exercise they made them|selves
dexterous and skilful how to defend themselves, and offend an enemy. And for
the heaviness of their counterfeit arms, they did it to make the true ones appear more
light. The Romans taught their Souldiers rather to thrust than to cut with their swords,
because thrusts are more mortal, more hard to be defended; and he that make it is not so
easily discovered, and is readier to double his thrust than his blow. Do not admire that
the ancients concerned themselves in such little things, for when people come to handy
strokes, every small advantage is of great importance; and this is not my own opinion
only, but is taught by many Authors. The ancients thought nothing more beneficial in a
Commonwealth, than to have store of men well exercised in arms; for 'tis not the Splen|dor
of their gemms, not their gold, that makes the enemy run, but the fear of their
arms.
The faults which one commits in other things may be repaired, but those which are
committed in war are never to be redressed; besides, experience in this kind makes men
more audacious and bold, for no man fears to do that which he thinks he understands: the
ancients therefore would have their Citizens exercise themselves in all military actions,
and made them cast darts (much heavier than the true ones) against their pales: which
besides that it taught them dexterity, it was a great strengthener of their arm. They
brought up their youth likewise to the bow and the sling, in all which exercises there were
professed Masters; so that when afterwards they were drawn out to the wars, they were
perfect Souldiers both in courage and discipline, nor were they defective in any thing but
keeping their ranks in their marches, and receiving orders in their fights; which was
quickly learn'd by mixing them with such as had serv'd a long time.

Cosimo.
What exercises would you recommend at present?



Fabritio.
Several of those which I have mentioned, as running, leaping, throwing the
bar, accustoming them to heavy arms, teaching them to shoot in the cross, and long bow,
and musket, which is a new engine, (as you know) but very good. And to these exercises
I would accustom all the youth in my Country, but with more industry and solicitude
those exercises which are useful in war, and all their musters should be in idle days. I would
have them learn to swim likewise, which is a very useful thing, for they are not sure of
bridges where-ever they come, and boats are not always to be had. So that your Army
not knowing how to swim, is deprived of several conveniencies, and lose many fair op|portunities
of action. The reason why the Romans, exercised their youth in the Campus
Martius, was, because of its nearness to the Tyber, where after they had tired themselves at
land, they might refresh, and learn to swim in the water.
I would have also the Cavalry exercised as of old, which is most necessary, for besides
teaching them to ride, it teaches them to sit fast when they come to a charge. To this end
they had horses of wood upon which they exercised, vaulting upon them sometimes with
their arms, and sometimes without, very neatly and exactly, without any assistance; so
that upon a signal from their Captain they were immediately on horse-back, and upon
another signal as soon upon the ground. And as those exercises both for horse and foot
were easie in those times, they would be the same now to any Prince or Commonwealth
that would employ their youth that way, as is to be seen in several Cities in the West,
where they are continued. They divide their Inhabitants into several parties, and every
party is denominated by the arms which they wear; and because they use pikes, halbards,
bows, and harquebusses, they are called Pike-men, Halbardiers, Bow-men, and Harquebus|siers;
every inhabitant is to declare in what Company he will be listed; and because some
for their age and other impediments are not apt for the wars, there is a choice made out
of every order, of such persons as are called, the Giurati being sworn to see the rest exer|cised
in their several arms, according to their respective denominations, and every one of
them has a certain place appointed where their exercises are to be made; and all that be|long
to that Order (besides the Giurati) repair thither with such monies as are necessary
for their expence. What therefore is done actually by them, we may do as well, but our
imprudence will not suffer us to imitate any thing that is good. By these exercises the an|cients
Infantry were very good, and at this day the western foot are better than ours, be|cause
the ancients exercised them at home, (as in the Commonwealths) or in the field
(as by the Emperors) for the reasons aforesaid. But we will not exercise them at home,
and in the field we cannot, they not being our subjects, are not to be compelled but to what
exercises they please: and this want of authority to exercise them has caused our Armies
to be first negligent and remiss, and afterwards our discipline; and has been the cause that
so many Kingdoms and Commonwealths (especially in Italy) are so weak and inconsi|derable.
But to return to our order, and the business of exercising, I say, that it is not sufficient
to make an absolute Souldier, to inure a man to labour, to make him strong, swift, and dex|terous,
but he must learn likewise to keep his ranks well, to obey orders, and the directions
of the trumpet and drum; to know how to do right, standing still, retiring, advancing,
fighting, and marching; for without this discipline be observed with all accurate diligence,
your Army will never be good. And without doubt men who are furious and disorderly,
are much more unserviceable than cowards; for order drives away fear, and dissorder lessens
a mans courage.



CHAP. VII.
Of what number of men, and of what arms a battalion is to consist; and of ex|ercising
in Companies to make them ready either to give a charge, or re|ceive
it.
ANd that you may the better understand what is said before, you must know that there
is no Nation which, to put in order its men of war, has not constituted a principal
member, which member, or body, though they have altered it as to their name, yet it is
not much altered as to the number of their men; for in all places they consist of betwixt
six and eight thousand. This body among the Romans was called a Legion, among the
Grecians a Phalanx, among the French Caterve; the same thing by the Swizzers (who are
the only people which retain any thing of the discipline of the ancients) is called that in

their language, which in ours is called Battalion. True it is, that afterwards every one di|vided
it into companies, and ordered them as they pleased. My advice is, that we found
our discourse upon the name which is most known, and range it as well as we may, accor|ding
to the order both of the ancients and moderns. And because the Romans divided
their Legions which consisted of betwixt 5 and 6000 men, into ten Cohorts, I think fit
that we divide our Battalions into ten Companies, and the whole consisting of 6000 men,
allot to every company 450, of which 400 may be compleatly armed, and the remaining
fifty slightly. The compleatly arm'd may by 300 with swords and bucklers called Scudat,
and an hundred with pikes called Pike-men. Those which are lightly arm'd may be
fifty foot, carrying Harquebusses, Cross-bows, Partizans and Halbards, which according to
the old name may be called Velites; so that all the ten Companies make 3000 bucklers,
1000 ordinary Pikes, and 500 ordinary Velites, which in all will amount to 4500 foot.
But because we say that our Battalion is to contain 6000 men, 1500 more are to be added,
of which 1000 are pikes, which we will call Pikes in extraordinary, and the other 500 are
to be slightly arm'd, and called Velites in extraordinary. So that my foot (as is said be|fore)
will be composed half of Bucklers, and the other half of Pikes, and other Arms.
I would have every Battalion have a Commander in chief, four Centurions, and forty
Capidieci or Corporals, and over and above, a Commander in chief of the Velites in or|dinary,
with five File-leaders. I would assign to the Velites in extraordinary two Officers
in chief, five Centurions, and fifty Corporals, then make a General of the whole Bat|talion.
I would have every Constable to have his Colours and Drums, by which means
the Battalion would consist of ten Companies, 300 Bucklers, 1000 Pikes in ordinary, 1000
extraordinary, 500 Velites in ordinary, and 500 in extraordinary; so as they would amount
in all to 6000 foot, among which there would be 600 Corporals, 15 Constables, 15 Drums,
15 Colours, 55 Centurions, 10 Commanders of the Velites in ordinary, and one General
of the whole Battalion, with his Standard and Drum,
I have repeated this order the oftner, that afterward when I shew you the way of ordering
a Battel or Army, you may not find your self confounded. I say therefore, that a King
or Commonwealth is to order his subjects, which he designs for the wars, with these arms,
and into these divisions, and raise as many Battalions as his Country will afford. And
when he has disposed them so, being to exercise them in order, he is to exercise them in
their several divisions. And although the number of each of them cannot bear the form of
a just Army, yet thereby every man may learn what belongs to his own duty, because in
Armies there are two orders observed, one what men are to do in every battel, or division
distinctly; and the other what they are to do when united with the rest; and those men
who know the first well, will easily learn the other; but without knowledg of the first,
they will never arrive at the discipline of the second.
Every one (then) of these Companies may learn by it self to keep the order of their
ranks in all motions and places, to open and close, and understand the direction of their
Drums, by which all things are commanded in a battel; for by beating of that (as by
the whistle in the Gallies) every man knows what he is to do, whether to stand firm to his
ground, to advance, or fall back, and which way they are to turn their faces and arms. So
that understanding the order of their files in that exactness that no motion, nor no place
can disorder them; understanding the commands of their Officer, derived to them by his
Drum, and how to advance,  fall back into their places, these Companies (as I have said be|fore)
as soon as joyned, may easily be taught what an united body of all the Battalions is
obliged to do when they are drawn together into an Army. And because this univer|sal
practice is of no slight importance, in time of peace it would be convenient once or
twice in a year to bring them to a general Rendezvous, and give them the form of an Army,
exercising them for some days as if they were to fight a battel with an enemy, drawing
them up, and disposing them into front, flank, and reserve. And because a General orders
his Army for a battel, either upon the sight or apprehension of an enemy, he is to exercise
his Army accordingly, and teach them how to behave themselves upon a march, and how
in a battel, and how upon a charge, either upon one side or other. When they are exer|cised
as if an enemy was before them, they are to be taught how they are to begin the fight
how they are to retreat upon a repulse, who are to succeed in their places; what Colours,
what Drums, what words of commands they are to obey, and so to train them up, and ac|custom
them to these false alarms, and counterfeit battels, that at length they become im|patient
to be at it in earnest, For an Army is not made valiant and couragious for having
brave and valiant men in it, but for the good order which is observed; for if I be in the for|lorn,
and know, being beaten, whither I am to retire, and who are to succeed in my place,
I shall fight boldly, because my relief is at hand. If I be of the second body that is to

engage, the distress, or repulse of the first will not fright me, because I considered it might
happen before, and perhaps desired it, that I might have the honour of the Victory, and
not they. Where an Army is new, this way of exercising is absolutely necessary, and
where it is old, it is convenient; for we see the Roman Captains before they brought them
to fight, continually exercised their men after this manner, though they had been brought
up to their Arms. Iosephus tells us in his History, that this continual exercising in the
Roman Army was the cause that all the multitude of idle people which followed the Camp
either for Traffick or gain, were made useful and serviceable, because they understood their
orders and ranks, and how to preserve them in time of Battel. But if you have raised an
Army of young men never in the Wars before, whether you intend them for present Ser|vice,
or to establish them as Militia, and engage them afterwards, without this way of
exercising by single Companies, and sometimes a conjunction of them all, you do nothing.
For order being perfectly necessary, it is convenient with double industry and labour to
teach such as are not skilful already, and practise such as are; as we have seen several ex|cellent
Commanders, to practise and instruct their Soldiers, take extraordinary pains without
any respect to their dignities.

Cosimo.
It seems to me that this discourse has a little transported you, for before you
have told us the way of exercising by Companies, you have treated of entire Armies, and
the managing of a Battel.


Fabritio.
You say right, and the true reason is the affection I bear to those orders,
and the trouble I am under that they are no more used; yet do not think but I will recol|lect
my self and return. As I told you before, in the exercising of a Company, the first
thing of importance is to know how to keep your ranks; to do this, it is necessary to ex|ercise
them in that order which they call Chiocciole, or the Snail order. And because I
have said that one of these Battalias or Companies is to consist of four hundred Foot
compleatly armed, I will keep to that number.
These four hundred men (then) are to be reduced into 80 files, five in a file, after which
they are to be carried forward upon a quick march, or a slow, wheeling, and doubling,
charging or retreating, which indeed is more demonstrable to the eye, than the under|standing.
But this Snail way of exercising a Company is not so necessary, because every
one that knows any thing of an Army, knows how 'tis to be done; and indeed it is not
considerable in any respect, but to teach Soldiers how to move their files; but let us now
draw up one of these Companies and dispose them into their ranks.



CHAP. VIII.
Of three principal ways of drawing up a Company, and putting them
into a posture to fight.
I Say that there are three principal forms of drawing up men; the first and most useful is
to draw them up close, in the figure of two Squares. The second is to draw them up
in a square with two wings. The third is to draw them up with a vacuity in the middle,
which they call Piazza. To draw them up in the first figure, there are two ways. One
is to double their files, that is, the second file entring into the first, the fourth into the third,
the sixt into the fift, and so successively; so that whereas they were 80 files of five in a
file, they may become forty files of 10 ih a file. After this you are to double them again
in the same manner, thrusting one file into another, and then they will be 20 files, and
twenty men in a file. This makes two squares, or very near; for though there be as many
men on one side as the other, yet towards the head they joyn together, so as one flank
may touch the other; but on the other side, their distance is at least two yards one from
the other; so that the square is longer from the Rear to the Front, than from one flank
to another. And because we are to speak often of the fore part, the hinder part, and the
sides, of this Battalia or Company, and of the whole Army when joyned; you must know
that when I say the head or the front, I mean the fore part of the Battel; when I say the
shoulders, I mean the hinder part; and when I say the flanks, I mean the sides. The
fifty Velites in ordinary, do not mingle with the rest of the files, but when the Battalia is
formed, they are disposed by its flanks. The other way of drawing up a Company is this,
(and because it is better than the first, I resolve to describe it so plain, that you shall under|stand
it as well as it were before your eyes) I suppose you remember of what number of
men, of what Officers it is composed, and what Arms it is to carry. The form therefore

of this Battalia is of twenty files, twenty men in a file, five files of Pikes in the front, and
fifteen files of Bucklers in the rear. Two Centurions in the front, and two in the rear,
which the ancients called Tergiductores. The Constable or Captain with his Colours and
Drum is to stand in the space betwixt the five files of Pikes, and the fifteen files of Buck|lers,
Corporals, upon the flank of every file one; so that each of them may have his men
by his side; those who are on the right hand, will have them on their left, those on the
left on their right; the fifty Velites are to be drawn up on the flanks and rear. Now
that your Soldiers may put themselves into this posture in their ordinary march, it is to be
done in this manner. You are first to reduce your Battalia into 80 files, five men in a file,
leaving your Velites either in the front or the rear, but they must be sure to be placed with|out
this order. Every Centurion is to be at the head of twenty files, five of Pikes are to
be immediately behind him, and the rest Bucklers.
The Constable or Captain is to stand with his Drum, and Colours in the space betwixt the
Pikes and the rest of the Bucklers belonging to the second Centurion, and may take up the
place of three of the Bucklers. Of the Capidieci or Corporals, twenty are to stand in
the flank of the files of the first Centurion, upon the left hand, and twenty upon the flank
of the last Centurion upon the right hand. And it is to be observed that every Corporal
who leads the Pikes, is to have a Pike in his hand: and they who lead the Scudi are to have
Bucklers in theirs.
Having put your files into this order, and being desirous upon their march to reduce
them into a Battalia to make head against an Enemy, you must cause the first Centurion
with his first twenty files to make a halt, and the second Centurion to continue his march
to the right all along by the sides of those twenty files which stand firm, till he comes cheek
by jole with the first Centurion, where he also makes his stand, and then the third march|ing
on likewise on the right hand by the flank of the said files, advances till he be even
with the other two Centurions, and then he making his stop, and so the rest; which being
done, two of the Centurions only are to depart from the front into the rear of the Battalia,
which by this means is in the same order as I said before. The Velites are to be drawn up
by the side, as they are disposed in the first way, which is called redoubling by a right line,
for the second way redoubles them in the flanks. The first way is more easie, this is more
orderly and useful, and may be better corrected and reformed to your mind, for in the
first you are obliged to conform to your number, for five doubled, make ten, ten twenty,
twenty forty; so that if you would double your files in a right line, you cannot make a front
of fifteen, five and twenty, thirty, nor thirty five, but you must go where the number
will carry you. And therefore it happens every day upon particular rencounters, that it is
necessary to make head with 7 or 800 foot, and in so doing to double in a right line would
undo you. For these reasons this way pleases me best, and the difficulties therein, are ea|sily
removed by exercise and practice. I say then that nothing is of greater importance
than to have Souldiers which can put themselves instantly into their ranks, and to learn that
it is necessary to exercise them in these Companies at home, to teach them the quick and
the slow march, to advance or retreat, and to pass thorow streights, and difficult places
without disturbing their order: For Soldiers that can do that well, are good Soldiers, and
may be called old Soldiers, though they never looked an Enemy in the face; whereas on
the contrary, if a man has been in a thousand Battels, and understands not that, he is but
a Novice, and a fresh-water Soldier. This is only as to closing their ranks upon a march
when they are in small files; but having closed their files, and being afterwards broken by
some accident (either from the place, or the Enemy) to rally, and recollect themselves
then, there lies the difficulty and importance which requires great exercise and practice,
and by the ancients was endeavoured with much industry. In this case it is necessary there|fore
to do two things.


CHAP. IX.
The manner of rallying Soldiers after a rout, and to make them face about
a whole Company at a time.

Fabr.
WHen a Squadron is broken, to rally and bring them again suddenly into order,
two things are convenient; first, that several Colours or Countermarks be
assigned to every Battalia: and secondly to observe this rule, that the same Foot stand still
in the same Files. For example, if a Soldier's place was formerly in the second File, let him

continue in that File, and not only in that File, but in the same place; and in order to that,
as I said before, several Countermarks are necessary. And first it is convenient that the
Ensigns and Colours of each Company be so handsomly distinguished, that being joyned
with other Squadrons, they may know one another. Next, that the Captains and Centu|rions
have Plumes of Feathers of Scarfs, or something that may make them conspicuous
and remarkable; and last of all (as being of more importance) the Capidieci or Corporals
are to be so accoutred that they may be known; and of this the ancients were so extraor|dinarily
curious, that their numbers were written upon their Helmets in great Characters,
calling them the first, second, third and fourth, c. And not content with this, every
Soldier had the number of his File, and the number of his place in that File engraven upon
his Buckler. Your Companies being in this manner made distinguishable by their Colours,
and accustomed to their Ranks and Files by practice and experience, it is no hard matter
though they be disordered, to rally, and reduce them suddenly again; for as soon as the
Colours are stuck down in the ground they are immediately visible, and the Captains and
Officers knowing which are their own, repair themselves, and dispose their Soldiers imme|diately
to their places, and when those on the left have placed themselves on the left hand,
and those which belong to the right hand on the right; the Soldiers directed by their
rules, and the difference of their Colours fall immediately into their Ranks, as easily as we
put together the Staffes of a Barrel when we have marked them before. These things if
learned with diligence and exercise at first, are quickly attained, and hardly forgot; for
your raw men are directed by the old, and in time a Province by these exercises might be
made very fit for the War. It is necessary therefore to teach them how to turn all together,
when to face about in the Rear, or the Flanks, and make Rear and Flank of the first Ranks
when occasion is offered.
And this is no hard matter to do, seeing it is sufficient, that every man faces to that side
he is commanded, and where they turn their faces, that is the Front. True it is, when they
face to the Flank, their Ranks do not hold their proportion, because the distance betwixt
the Front and the Rear is thereby much lessened, and the distance betwixt the extremity of
the Flanks is much encreased, which is quite contrary to the genuine order of a Battalia,
for which cause great practice and discretion is required to rectifie it, and yet this may be
remedied by themselves. But that which is of greater consequence, and which requires
more practice, is when an Officer would turn his whole Company together, as if it were
a single man, or a solid and massy body of it self. And this requires longer experience than
the other. For if you would have it turn to the left, the left corner must stand still, and
they who are next them, march so leisurely, that they in the right may not be put to run;
if they be, it will breed confusion.
But because it always happens that when an Army marches from place to place, that the
Companies which are not in the Front, are forced to fight in the Flanks, or Rear, so that
one and the same Company is many times compelled to face about to the Flanks and Rear at
one and the same time, that these Companies therefore may in this exigence hold their old
proportion, according to what is said before, it is necessary that they have Pikes in that
Flank which is most likely to be attacked, and Capidieci Captains, and other Officers in their
proper places.



CHAP. X.
To range a Company in such order that it may be ready to face the Enemy,
on which side soever he comes.

Fabr.
WHen you have marshalled your fourscore Files, five in a File; you are to put all
your Pikes into the first twenty Files, and place five of your Corporals in the
head of them, and five in the Rear. The other 60 Files which follow, are Bucklers all, and
consist of 300 men. So then the first and last File of every Company, are to be Corporals;
The Captain with his Ensign and Drum, is to stand in the midst of the first hundred of
Bucklers, and every Centurion at the head of his Division. When they are in this order
if you desire to have your Pikes on the left hand, you are to double them Company by
Company from the right Flank; if you would have them on the right, you are to double
from the left; and this is the way by which a Company turns with the Pikes upon one
Flank, with their Officers at the Head and the Rear of them, and their Captain in the midst,
and it is the form which is observed in a march. But upon the approach of an Enemy,

when they would make a Front of a Flank, they have no more to do but to command that
all of them face about to that Flank where the Pikes are, and in so doing the whole Batta|lia
turns with its Files and Officers at the same time in the manner aforesaid; for (unless it
be the Centurions) they are all in their old places, and the Centurions can quickly be there.
But when a Battalia marches in the Front, and is in danger to be engaged in the Rear; the
Files are to be so ordered, that the Pikes may be readily behind; and to do this there needs
no more, but whereas usually in every Battalia, every Century has five Files of Pikes in
the Front, those five Files may be placed in the Rear, and in all other places the same order
to be observed as before.


Cosimo.
If my memory fails not, you said that this way of exercise is in order to the
uniting these Battalia's into an Army, and that this practice is sufficient to direct them in
that. But if it should happen this Squadron of 450 Foot should be to fight singly and by
its self, how would you order it then?


Fabritio.
He who commands them is to judge where his Pikes are to be disposed,
and place them as he thinks fit, which is not at all consistant with what I have prescribed
before; for though that be a way to be observed in Battel upon an union or conjunction of
several Squadrons, yet it may serve as a rule in what ever condition you fall into. But in
showing you the two other ways which I recommended for the ordering of a Battalia, I
will satisfie you farther.



CHAP. XI.
To draw up a Company with two horns, or another with a Piazza,
or vacuity in the middle.
TO come to the way of drawing up a Battalia or Squadron with two horns or points,
I say you must order your 80 Files, five in a File, after this manner.
In the midst you must place a Centurion with 25 Files, two of Pikes to the left, and
three of Bucklers to the right: when those five are disposed, bring up the other twenty,
with twenty Files and File-leaders, all of them to be placed betwixt the Pikes and the Buck|lers,
only those who carry Pikes are to stand with the Pikes. After these twenty five Files
are so placed, draw up another Centurion with fifteen Files of Bucklers; after which the
Constable or Captain is to draw into the middle with his Drum and his Colours, with other
fifteen Files of Bucklers. This being performed, the next to march up is the third Centu|rion,
who is to be at the head of 25 Files, of 5 in a File, three Bucklers to the left, and
two Pikes to the right; and after the 5 first Files, let there be twenty File-leaders placed
betwixt the Pikes and the Bucklers, and after these the fourth Centurion: Having drawn
your men into this order; to make a Battalia consisting of two horns, the first Centurion
is to make a stand with his 25 Files at his heels; then is the second Centurion to advance
with his 15 Files of Bucklers, and place himself on the right hand of the 1st. Centurion,
and marching along by the side of the 25 Files, he is to advance till he comes to the 15
File, and there he is to stop. The next that marches is the Captain with his division of 15
Files of Bucklers behind him, and advancing on the right hand by the flank of the other
15 Files, he is to march up to their front. After him the third Centurion is to move
with his 25 Files, and the fourth Centurion after him, and passing along by the right flank
of the last 15 Files of Bucklers, they are not to stop at the front of the said Files, but to
advance till the last of the twenty five Files be parallel with the Files which are behind them.
As soon as this is done, the Centurion at the head of the 1st. 15 Files of Bucklers, is to
remove into the left angle in the rear, and by this means you shall form a Battalia of five
and twenty firm Files of twenty men in a File with two horns, on each side of the front
one, each of them consisting of ten Files of 5 in a File, with a space betwixt the two
horns, sufficient to receive ten men a breast. Betwixt the two horns the Captain is to be
placed, and a Centurion at each point or angle; there are likewise to be two Files of
Pikes, and twenty Corporals on each Flank. These horns or wings are useful to receive
and secure Carriages or Artillery, when they have any with them; The Velites are to be
drawn up along the flanks under the shelter of the Pikes. But to reduce this horn'd Squa|dron
into another Figure with a space in the middle, no more is to be done, than out of
the 15 Files of twenty in a File, to take eight, and place them upon the point of the two
horns, which will make a good rear, and turn it into a Battalia Della Piazza, or a Battalia
with a space in the the midst; in this space or Area, the Carriages are disposed, and the Cap|tain

and his Colours, but not the Artillery, for they are placed either in the front, or along
the flanks. These are the forms to be observed in a Battalia or Squadron when it marches
alone thorow dangerous places. But the single Battalia without horns or vacuity is better,
though to secure such as are disarmed, the horned figure is convenient. The Swisses have
several forms of drawing up their Battalia's, one is the fashion of a Cross, placing their
Harquebussiers betwixt the Arms of the said Cross to secure them from the Enemy. But
because those figures are proper only when Squadrons fight singly and by themselves, and
my intention being to show they may fight united and in conjunction, I shall not trouble
my self with them.

Cosimo.
I fancy I do sufficiently comprehend the way that is to be observed to exercise
men in these Battalia's; but (if I mistake not) you told us that to the ten Battalia's,
(which united, make a Battalion) you would add a thousand extraordinary Pikes, and four
hundred of the extraordinary Velites. And these would you not advise should be ex|ercised?


Fabritio.
I would, and with very great diligence, exercising the Pikes with the same
care as the rest, because I would make more use of them than the rest upon all private occa|sions,
as in conducting convoys of provisions, depredations, and such like. But my Ve|lites
I would exercise at home without bringing them together; for it being their office
to fight loose and confused, it is not necessary that they should be always exercised as the
rest; for it is enough if they understand their own business well. They ought then (as I
said before) and I am not troubled to repeat it again) so to exercise their men in these
Battalia's, that they may know to keep their ranks, understand their places, wheel readily,
and shift handsomly either upon sight of an Enemy, or inconvenience of the place. For
when they can do this well, they will easily learn which are their places, and what are their
duties in a Battel. And if a Prince or Commonwealth grudges not to take pains, and
employ themselves in seeing their Subjects thus exercised, they would have always good
Soldiers, be always too hard for their Neighbours, and would be in a condition rather to
give, than receive Laws from other people. But (as I have said before) the disorder in
which we live, is the cause that we do not only neglect, but despise those things, and that
is the true reason our Souldiers are no better; and though there may be Officers and Sol|diers
too that perhaps are both valiant and skilful; yet they have no occasion or encourage|ment
to show themselves.



CHAP. XII.
Of the Baggage and Train belonging to a Company; How necessary it is that
they have several Officers, and of the usefulness of Drums.

Cosimo.
I Would ask you now, what Carriages you would allot to each of these
Battalia's?


Fabritio.
In the first place I would not allow that either Centurion or Corporal
should march on Horseback, and if the Captain must ride, I would allow him only a
Mule. I would allow him two Carriages, one to every Centurion, and two betwixt every
three Corporals, because we quarter them together in our Camp, as shall be shown in its
due place; so that to every Battalia there should be 36 Carriages, which I would have
carry the Tents, and Utensils for their Cookery; their Hatchets, and other Iron Instru|ments
to set up their Huts, Tents, and Pavilions; and if there be afterwards any place
left, let them carry what they please.


Cosimo.
I am of opinion that the Officers which you have appointed in every of these
Battalia's are necessary, yet I should be afraid so many Commanders should confound
them.


Fabritio.
What you say would be true, were they not subordinate to one; but de|pending
still upon one person, they proceed very regularly, nay without them, they could
not possibly be governed. For a wall that is tottering in all places, requires that its But|tresses
and Supporters be rather many than strong, because the strength and goodness of
one, will not hinder the ruine which will follow. And therefore in all Armies, and among
every ten men, it is convenient to have one of more life, more courage, and more autho|rity
than the rest, who with his alacrity, and language, and example, may encourage the
rest, and dispose them to fight. And to prove the necessity of these things in an Army,
(viz. Ensigns, Officers and Drums) it appears by our Armies, where there are of them all,

but none of them do their office, according to the intent of their establishment. First
your Capidieci or File-leaders, if they answer the end for which they were established, are
to have their men a-part, lodge with them, charge with them, and be always in the same file
with them; for being kept to their due places, the File-leaders are a rule and temper to the
rest, keeping them firm and straight in their files, so as it is impossible almost that they be
disordered, and if they be, they are quickly reduced. But in our days we make no other|wise
of them but to give them greater pay, and enable them to make particular factions.
'Tis the same with our Ensigns; for they are used more for pomp and parade, than any
military service; whereas formerly the Captains employed them as guides, and directions
in case of disorder; for every man, as soon as the Ensign was fix'd, knew his place imme|diately,
and immediately return'd to it. They knew likewise thereby how they were to
move, or to halt: it is necessary therefore in an Army that there be several of these small
Bodies; that every Body has its Colours, and Ensign, and Guide; for where there are ma|ny
Bodies, there ought to be many Arms, and many Officers. The Souldiers (then) are
to follow the motion of their Colours, and their Colours the direction of their Drum,
which (being well ordered) commands the Army, and advertizes how they are to march
with a motion suitable to the time which it beats, which is a great preservation to their
order. For this cause the ancients had their flutes and pipes which made an excellent har|mony:
and as he that dances, keeps himself exactly to the time of the musick; and whilst
he does so, is not capable of erring: so an Army that in its motions observes the beating
and direction of its Drums, cannot be easily disordered. For this reason they varied their
sounds when they would excite, or asswage, or continue the courage of their men. And
as their ways of beating were various, so they gave them several names. The Dorick way
provoked to constancy and frmness; the Phrygian inflam'd the Souldiers into a martial
fury and violence. It is repoed that Alexander being one day at dinner, and hearing a
Drum beating suddenly, the Phrygian way, was transported with so great a vehemence and
commotion, that he clap'd his hand upon his Sword, and drew it, as if he had been going
to fight. So that in my judgment it would be very convenient to revive the ancient dia|lects
of the Drum, and practices of our Ancestors, and if that should prove too difficult,
yet those persons should not be despised and laid aside, who would teach and instruct the
Souldier how to obey them; yet those ways may be changed and varied as every man
pleases, provided he ensures his Souldiers ears to understand the variety: but now a-days the
greatest use of the Drum, is to make a great noise.


Cosimo.
I would fain know of you (if you have ever considered it with your self)
how it comes to pass that such military exercises are in our times grown so low and con|temptible.


Fabr.
I shall tell you freely what I think may be the cause.



CHAP. XIII.
A discourse of the Author about military Virtue; and how it is become so
despicable in our days.

Fabr.
YOu know Europe (according to the testimony of several Authors) has afforded
many excellent Captains; Africk has had some and Asia fewer: and the reason
(as I conceive) is, because those two quarters of the World have had but one or two Mo|narchies
among them, and very few Commonwealths; but Europe has had several King|doms,
and more Commonwealths; and men are industrious, and by consequence excel|lent,
as they are employed and preferred by their Prince, or their State. Where therefore
there are many Princes, there are many brave men; where there are but few of the first,
there are fewer of the other. We find in Asia there was Ninus, Cyrus, Artaxerxes, Mithri|dates,
and some few others of that rank. In Africa (besides the Aegyptian antiquity)
there were Massinissa, Iugurtha, and those great Captains which were trained up in the
Carthaginian Wars, which notwithstanding in respect of the numbers which have been
produced in Europe, were very few; for in Europe their brave Generals are innumerable
in History, or at least they would have been, had the Historians (with those they have
already recorded) made mention of such as are now forgotten by the malignity of time.
For there people are more virtuous, where there have been frequent revolutions of State,
and where the Governments have favoured virtue either out of necessity, or compas|sion.

As for Asia, it has not produced many extraordinary men, because that Province was
wholly under a Monarchy, which (by reason of its greatness, the greatest part of it being
always at peace) could not produce such excellent men, as where there was action and
war.
In Africa it was the same, yet there they were more numerous, by reason of the Car|thaginian
Republick: for Commonwealths do furnish the World with more brave men
than Kingdoms; because in States, virtue is many times honoured and advanced; in Mo|narchies
and Kingdoms it is suspected; from whence it proceeds that in the one it is en|couraged,
in the other exploded. He then who shall consider Europe, shall find it full of
Commonwealths, and Principalities, which in respect of the jealousies and animosities be|twixt
them, were constrained to keep up the old military discipline, and advance those
who in it were any ways eminent; for in Greece, besides the Macedonians, there were ma|nay
Republicks, and in each of them, several excellent men.
The Romans, the Samnites, the Tuscans, Cisalpine Gauls, France and Germany were full
of Republicks and Principalities, and Spain was the same. And though in respect of the
Romans, the numbers which are mentioned of them in History, are but small; that pro|ceeds
from the emulation and partiality of the Historians, who following fortune, content
themselves with commending the Conqueror; but 'its unreasonable to imagine that among
the Samnites and Tuscans (who waged war with the Romans 150 years together before
they were totally subdued) there were not many brave men; and so in France and in Spain;
but the virtue which Authors do not celebrate in particular men, they impute generally to
the whole people, whom they exalt to the skies for their constancy, and adherence to their
liberty.
It being true then, that where there are most Principalities and Governments there are
more excellent men; it follows, that when those Governments and Principalities extin|guish,
their brave men and virtue extinguish with them, there being loss occasion to exert it.
After the Roman Empire had dilated in self so strangely, and subverted all the Common|wealths
and Principalities in Europe, and Africa, and the greatest part of those in Asia; vir|tue
declined in all places but in Rome. Whereupon virtuous men began to grow thinner
in Europe and Asia, and by degrees came afterwards to a total declination; for the virtue of
the whole World being as it were inclosed in the walls of Rome, when it grew depraved
and corrupted there, the whole World became corrupt, and the Scythians were encouraged
to make their inroads and depredations upon the Empire which had been able to consume
and extinguish the virtue of all other places, but was not able to preserve it at home. And
though afterwards by the inundation of those Barbarians it was divided into several Can|tons;
yet for two reasons their virtue was never restored: one was because when Laws
and Orders are once neglected and disused, it is with no little pain that they are reassumed:
the other, our way of living in these times (in respect of the Christian Religion) imposes
not that necessity of defending our selves, as anciently it did: for then those who were
overcome in war, either killed themselves, or remained in perpetual slavery, in which they
lived afterwards in continual misery. The Towns that were taken were either totally de|molished,
or the Inhabitants banished, their Goods plundered, their Estates sequestred, and
themselves dispersed all over the World; so that he who was overcome, suffered such
miseries as are not to be expressed. People being terrified by these insupportable cruel|ties,
kept up the reputation of military discipline, and advanced all those who were ex|cellent
therein.
But at present we are under no such apprehensions: no man kills himself for being
conquered: no man is kept long a prisoner, because it is more easie to set him at liberty.
If a City rebels twenty times, it is not immediately razed and demolished; the Citizens
are continued in their Estates, and the greatest punishment they fear, is a mulct or a tax:
so that men will not now submit to military orders, nor apply themselves to those
labours to avoid a peril which they do not apprehend. Besides, the Provin|ces
of Europe are under few heads in comparison of what they were anciently: for all
France is under one King; all Spain under another: Italy is divided into four parties, so
that the weaker Cities that are unable to maintain war of themselves, defend themselves
by alliances with the Conqueror; and those who are strong (for the reasons abovesaid) are
in no fear of ruine.


Cos.
And yet within these five and twenty years several Cities have been sack'd, and se|veral
Kingdoms subverted which example should teach others to reassume, and live accor|ding
to the custom of our ancestors.


Fabr.
'Tis true as you say, yet if you observe what those Towns were which have suf|fered
in that nature, you will find that they were no capital Cities, but subordinate, and de|pending:

so we see though Tortona was demolished, Milan was not, though Capua was
destroyed, Naples was not: Brescia was sack'd, but Venice was not: Ravenna was pillaged,
but Rome was not. These examples do not make him who governs recede from his de|signs,
but makes him rather more refractory and obstinate, and pursue them with more ve|hemence,
to recompence himself with taxes and new impositions. This it is that makes
men unwilling to expose themselves to the trouble of military exercises, oking upon it
partly as unnecessary, and partly as a thing which they do ot understand. Those who
are subjects, and ought to be affrighted with such example of servitue, ve not power
to help themselves; and those who are Princes, having lost their dominion, are unable, as
having neither time nor convenience: Whilst those who are able, either cannot, or will
not; choosing rather to run along with fortune, without any disquiet, than to trouble
themselves to be virtuous; for believing that all things are governed by fortune, they had
rather follow her swing, than contend with her for mastery. And that you may believe
what I have said to be really true, consider the Country of Germany, where, by rea|son
of their several Principalities and States, their discipline is good; and depends upon
the example of those people, who being jealous of their States and Seigneuries, maintain
themselves in honour and grandeur, as fearing to fall into a servitude, out of which they
could not so easily emerge.
This I suppose is sufficient to shew the reason of the vileness and depravity of our pre|sent
discipline; I know not whether you may be of the same opinion, or whether my
discourse may not have raised some scruple in your mind.


Cosimo.
Not at all, I am rather perfectly satisfied, only I desire (returning to our first
subject) to know of you how you would order your horse with these Battalia's, in what
numbers you would have them, how you would have them arm'd, and how officer'd.



CHAP. IV.
What number of horse are to be put into a Battalion, and what proportion is to be observed for their baggage.

Fabr.
YOu may think perhaps I forgot it, but do not wonder, for I shall speak of it but
little for two reasons. One is, because the nerves and strength of an Army 
the Infantry; the other is, because the horse are not so much debauched and degenerated as
the foot; for the Cavalry is equal, if not better at this day than in ancient times. Yet
I have said something before of the way how they are to be exercised, and as to the man|ner
of arming them, I would arm them according to our present fashion, both light horse,
and men at arms. But the light horse (if I might prescribe) should carry cross-bows, with
some few harquebusses among them, which (though in other affairs of war they are but of
little use) are here very necessary, to frighten the Country people, and force them from their
passes, which perhaps they have undertaken to defend: for one harquebuss will scarre them
more than an hundred other arms. But to come to their number, having undertaken to
imitate the Roman Militia, I would take but 300 good horse for every Battalion, of which
150 should be men at arms, and 150 light horse; and I would appoint a Captain to each of
these squadrons, 15 Corporals to each, and a Trumpet and Ensign. I would allow every
ten men at arms five Carriages, and every ten light horse, two; which Carriages (as with
the foot) should carry the Tents, Utensils, Hatchets, and other Instruments and Harness.
Think not that what I say would be any disorder, seeing their men at arms had each of
them four horses in their equipage, which is a thing much corrupted; for now in Germany
you shall see men at arms with but one horse, and themselves, and twenty of them are al|lowed
but one Wagon to carry their necessaries. The Roman horse were likewise alone,
but the Triarii were lodg'd always by them, who were obliged to assist them in the looking
to their horses, which may be easily imitated by us, as shall be shewn in the distribution of
our lodgments: what there the Romans did of old, and what the Germans do at this day,
we may do likewise, and we do very ill if we do not.
These horse being listed and called over, may be mustered sometimes with the Battalion,
at a general Muster of all the Companies, and be appointed to make charges, and counter|feit
skirmishes with them, rather to bring them acquainted, than for any thing else. What
we have said already is sufficient for this part: let us now come to marshal our Army, and
draw it up in a posture to fight, and with hopes of success, which is the great end of all
kind of military discipline, in which men employ so much study and diligence.





THE THIRD
BOOK.

CHAP. I.
The Order observed by the Roman Legions when a Battel was presented.

Cosimo.
SEeing we change our subject, I shall yield my place of expostulating to ano|ther
man; for presumption being a thing which I condemn in other peo|ple,
I would not be too much guilty of it my self, therefore I dismiss my
self of that office, and will transfer it to which of our friends will vouch|safe
to accept it.


Zanobi.
It would have been very grateful to us all, had you pleased to have continued;
but seeing 'tis not your pleasure, tell us at least which of us it is you will depute to succeed
you.


Cosimo.
I shall leave that to the election of Signor Fabritio.


Fabr.
I am content to undertake it, and do desire that we may follow the Venetian
custom, by which the youngest of the company has the liberty to speak first, and in this case
not without reason; for this being the proper exercise of young men, I persuade my
self young Gentlemen are the fittest to discourse of it, as being most ready to follow
it.


Cosimo.
'Tis then your province Luigi, and as I do much please my self in my successor,
so you may be as well satisfied with his interrogation. But that we lose no time, let us re|turn
to our business.


Fabritio.
I am certain, that to demonstrate how well an Army is to be marshall'd and
prepared for a Battel; it would be necessary to declare how the Greeks and Romans ordered
The Troops in their Armies: but because these things are sufficiently obvious in History, I
shall pass by several particulars, and address my self only to such as I think most useful for our
imitation, and fittest to give perfection to the discipline of our times, which will be the oc|casion
that at once I give you a prospect how an Army is to be ranged in order to a Battel;
how they are to confront and charge one another in a real Engagement; and how they
may be exercised in a counterfeit. The greatest disorders committed in the drawing up
an Army for a Battel, is to give it only a front, because they leave them and their fortune
to the success of one charge: and this error proceeds from nothing but from having lost
the old way of closing their ranks, and thrusting one into another. Without that way
there is no relieving of the front, no defending them, nor no supplying their places in the
heat of their Engagement, which among the Romans was most accurately observed. To
the end therefore that you may comprehend this way, I say, that the Romans divided each
Legion into three Bodies.
The first were Hastati, the second Principes, the third Triarii. The Hastati were in the
front of the Army, in thick and firm ranks. The Principes behind them, but their ranks
not altogether so close: and after them the Triarii in so loose an order, that they could re|ceive
both Principes and Hastati into their body upon any distress. Besides these they had
their Slingers, their Bow-men, and their Velites; not drawn up in this order, but placed
at the head of the Army, betwixt the Cavalry and the Foot.
These light arm'd Souldiers began the Fight, and if they prevailed, (which was very sel|dom)
they followed the Victory; if they were repulsed, they fell back by the nks of the
Army, or thorow certain spaces appointed on purpose, and retired among those who had
no arms. When they were retir'd, the Hastati advanced against the enemy, and finding
themselves overpowred, they retir'd softly to the Principes, and fell into their ranks, and
together with them renewed the Fight; but if they also were too weak to sustain the fury

of the Battel, they retreated all into the spaces of the Triarii, and all together being conso|lidated
into a firm mass, they made another effort more impetuous than before; if this
miscarried, all was lost, for there was no farther reserves. The Horse were plac'd at the
corners of the Army, like two wings to a body, and fought sometimes on Horseback, and
sometimes on foot, as occasion was offered. This way of reinforcing three times, is almost
impossible to be master'd, because fortune must fail you three times before you can be
beaten, and the Enemy must be so valiant as to conquer you as often.



CHAP. II.
The form observed in their Battels by the Macedonian Phalanx.
THe Grecians ordered not their Phalanx, as the Romans did their Legions, and though
they had many Officers among them, and several ranks, yet they made but one body,
or rather one front. The way which they observed to relieve one another, was not to retire
one rank into another, like the Romans, but to put one man into the place of another,
which was done in this manner. Their Phalanx being reduced into Files (and let us sup|pose
each File to consist of fifty men) being afterwards with the front towards the Enemy
of all the Files, only the six first could charge, because their Launces (which they called Sa|rissae) were so long, that the sixt rank charged with the point of his Launce thorow the
first ranst: In the Fight therefore, if any of the first rank was either killed or disabled, he
who was behind in the second rank supplyed his place; and the vacuity in the second rank,
was filled up out of the third, and so successively, and on a sudden the ranks behind, sup|plyed
what was defective before; so as their ranks remained always entire, and no place
left void but the last rank, which was not reinforced, because there was no body behind to
supply them: So that the loss in the first rank, exhausted the latter, and yet it self was
continued entire. So that these Phalanxes were sooner consumed and annihilated than bro|ken,
because the closeness and grosseness of the body made them impenetrable. The Romans
at first used these Phalanxes, and instructed their Legions in that way: Afterwards they
grew weary of that order, and parted their Legions into several divisions, viz. into Co|hortes
and Manipuli, judging (as I said before) that body to be most vigorous and fullest
of life, that consisted of most members, so constituted as that they could subsist and govern
themselves.


CHAP. III.
How the Swisses ordered their Battalions.

Fab.
THe Swisses at present do use the same method with their Battalions, as the Mace|donians
did anciently with their Phalanxes, both enranging them entire and in
gross, and in relieving one another. When they came to a Battel, they disposed their Squa|drons
one in the Flank of another, and not behind. They have not the way of receiving
the first into the second upon a repulse, but to relieve one another, they observe this order;
they put their Battalions one in the flank of another, but somewhat behind it, towards the
right hand; so that if the first be in any distress, the second advances to relieve it. The
third Battalion they place behind the other two, but at the distance of the shot of a Harque|buss,
that if the two Battalions should be worsted, the third might advance in their rescue,
and that which advances, and the other which retire may have space to pass by one another
without any clashing or collision; for gross bodies cannot be received so commodiously as
little; and therefore small bodies, disposed at a distance (as they were in the Roman Le|gions)
might better receive, and relieve one another upon occasion. And that this order
of the Swisses is not so good as the ancient order of the Romans, is demonstrated by many
examples of their Legions when they were engaged with the Macedonian Phalanxes; for
these were still worsted by the other: The fashion of their Arms, and their way of Reserves
being more effectual, than the closeness and solidity of a Phalanx.




CHAP. IV.
How the Author would make use of both Greek and Roman Arms for his
Battalion, and what was the ordinary Army of the Romans.
BEing therefore according to these Models to range and marshal an Army, I think it
best to retain something of the Arms, and Orders both of the Phalanx and Legion.
For this reason I have said in a Battalion I would have 2000 Pikes (which were the Arms
of the Macedonian Phalanx) and 3000 Scudi or Shields and Swords, which are the Arms
of the Romans. I have divided a Battalion into ten Battalia's or Companies, as the Ro|mans
divided their Legions into ten Cohorts. I have ordered the Velites or light-arm'd to
begin the fight, as they did formerly. And because as the Arms are mix'd, they partici|pate
of the one Nation and the other; that they may participate likewise in their orders,
I have appointed that every Company may have five files of Pikes in the front, and the
rest of Bucklers, that the front may be enabled to keep out the Horse, and break more
easily into the Foot, having Pikes in the first charge as well as the Enemy, by which they
may be fortified to sustain it bravely, till the Bucklers come up, and perfect the Victory.
And if you consider the strength and vertue of this Order, you will find how all these
Arms perform their office exactly. For Pikes are very useful against Horse, and against
Foot too, before the Battels be joyned, but after they are joyned, they are utterly useless.
For this reason, behind every third rank of Pikes, the Swissers put a rank of Halbards,
which was to make room for their Pikes, though indeed it was not enough. Placing
therefore our Pikes before, and our Bucklers behind them, they are enabled to sustain the
Horse, and when they come to charge, they do open and press hard upon the Foot; but
when the fight is begun, and the Battels are joyned, the Bucklers succeed with their Swords,
as being manageable more easily in the crowd.

Luigi.
We desire now to understand, how with these Arms and Orders you would ma|nage
your Army to give the Enemy Battel.


Fabritio.
I shall show you nothing at present but this: You must know that in an
ordinary Army of the Romans (which they called a Consular Army) there were no more
but two Legions of Citizens, consisting in all of 600 Horse, and about 11000 Foot. They
had besides these as many more Horse and Foot sent them in by their Friends and Confe|derates:
These Auxiliaries were divided into two parts, the right wing, and the left; for
they would never suffer them to exceed the number of the Foot of their Legions, though
their Horse indeed they permitted to be more. With this Army consisting of 22000 Foot,
and about 2000 Horse, a Roman Consul did all his business, and attempted any thing. Yet
when they were to oppose a greater power, they joyned two Consuls together, and their
two Armies. You must know likewise that in the three great Actions of an Army (their
march, their encampment, and engagement) they placed the Legions in the middle, be|cause
the force in which they reposed their greatest confidence they thought fit should be
more united and compact, as I shall show you more at large when I come to treat of those
things.
These Auxiliary Foot by vertue of their conversation with the Legionary Foot, grew
to be as Serviceable as they, because they were train'd and disciplin'd with them, and upon
occasion of Battel, drawn up in the same figure and order. He therefore who knows how
the Romans marshalled one single Legion in the day of Battel, knows how they disposed of
them all: When I have told you therefore how they divided a Legion into three Squadrons,
and how one Squadron received another; I shall have told you how a whole and entire
Army is to be ordered, when it is to be drawn up for Battel.




CHAP. V.
The way of drawing up a Battalion, according to the intention
of the Author.
BEing to prepare for a Battel according to the method of the Romans, as they had two
Legions, so I would take two Battalions, and by the ordering of them, you may
guess how to order a compleat Army: For to add more men, is only to multiply their
ranks. I think it unnecessary to repeat what foot there are in a Legion, what Companies,
what Officers, what Arms, what Velites in ordinary, what in extraordinary, what Pikes,
and what other things. For it is not long since I told you distinctly, and press'd it upon
your memories as a thing very necessary for the understanding all other Orders; wherefore
I shall pass on without farther reflection.
It seems to me best that one of the ten Battalions, or Companies of a Battalion be placed
in the left flank, and the other ten of the other Battalion on the right. Those on the left
are to be ordered in this manner: Put five Battalia's (one on the side of the other) in the
front, so as there may remain a space of four yards betwixt each, draw them up so as they
may possess in breadth 140 yards of ground, and in depth forty: behind these five Batta|lia's,
I would place three others, distant in a right line from the first about forty yards; of
these three, I would have two follow directly the Companies which are upon the two ex|tremities
or corners of the five first, and the third should be disposed in the midst; by
which means these three Companies should take up as much ground both in breadth and
depth as the other five, which have only five yards distance betwixt the one and the other,
whereas the three last should have thirty three. This being done, I would cause the two
Companies remaining to advance, and place themselves behind the three former in a right
line, and at the distance of forty yards; but it should be in such a sort, that each of these
two Companies should be ranged directly behind the extremity of the three precedent
Companies, and the space left betwixt them should be 91 yards: By these means all the
Companies thus disposed should extend themselves in front 161 yards, and in depth 20.
After this I would extend the Pikes extraordinary along the flanks of all the Companies on
the left hand, at about twenty yards distance; and I would make of them 140 ranks of
seven in a rank, so that they should secure all the left flank (in depth) of the ten Battalia's,
drawn up as I said before; and I would reserve forty files of them to guard the Baggage,
and the unarmed people in the rear, distributing their Corporals and other Officers in their
respective places. The three Constables or Captains I would place one at the head of
them, another in the midst, and a third in the rear, who should execute the Office of a Ter|giductor,
who was always placed in the rear of the Army. But to return to the front of
the Army; I say, that after the Pikes extraordinary, I would place the Velites extraor|dinary
(which are 500) and allow them a space of forty yards. By the side of these on
the left hand I would place my men at Arms, with a space of 150 yards; after them I
would advance my light Horse, at the same distance as I allowed to my men at Arms. As
to the Velites in ordinary, I would leave them about their Battalia's, which should take up
the space which I left betwixt each Company, unless I found it more expedient to put
them under the Pikes extraordinary, which I would do or not do, as I found it more or less
for my advantage. The Captain General of the Battalion should be placed in the space
betwixt the first and second orders of Battalia's, or else at the head of them, or else in the
space betwixt the last of the first five Battalia's, and the Pikes extraordinary, as I found it
most convenient: he should have about him 30 or 40 select men, all brave and experi|enc'd,
and such as understood how to execute their Commission with prudence, and how to
receive and repel a charge; and I would have the Captain General in the midst of the
Drums and the Colours.
This is the order in which I would dispose my Battalion on the left wing, which should
contain half the Army, and take up in breadth 511 yards, and in depth as much as I have
said before (without reckoning the space that was possessed by the Pikes extraordinary,
which should be as a Shield to the people without Arms, and take up a space of about a
hundred yards;) The other Battalion I would dispose on the right side, leaving betwixt the
two Battalions a distance of about 30 yards, having order'd it as the other: At the head
of that space I would place some pieces of Artillery, behind which should stand the Cap|tain
General of the whole Army, with the Drums, the Standard or chief Ensign, and
two hundred choice men about him (most of them on foot) and amongst them ten or

more fit to execute any command. The General himself should be so mounted, and so
arm'd, that he might be on Horseback, and on foot as necessity required. As to the Ar|tillery,
ten pieces of Cannon would be enough for the taking of a Town. In the Field
I would use them more for defence of my Camp, than for any Service in Battel. My
smaller pieces should be of 10 or 15 pound carriage, and I would place them in the front
of the whole Army, unless the Country was such that I could dispose them securely in the
flank, where the Enemy could not come at them.
This form and manner of ranging an Army, and putting it in order, may do the same
things in a Battel as was done either in the Macedonian Phalanx, or the Legion of the Ro|mans;
for the Pikes are in the front; and all the foot placed in their ranks; so that upon
any charge or engagement with the Enemy, they are able not only to bear and sustain them,
but (according to the custom of the Phalanx) to recruit and reinforce their first rank, out
of those which are behind.
On the other side if they be over-power'd, and attack'd with such violence that they
are forced to give ground, they may fall back into the intervals of the second Battalia be|hind
them, and uniting with them, make up their body, and charge them briskly again:
And if the second Battalia is not strong enough to relieve them, they may retire to the
third, and fight all together in conjunction; so that by this order (as to the business of a
Battel) we may supply and preserve our selves according to the Grecian and the Roman
way both.
As to the strength of an Army, it cannot be ordered more strong, because the two
wings are exactly well fortified with Officers and Arms; nor is there any thing weak but
the rear, where the people which follow the Camp without Arms are disposed, and they
are guarded with the Pikes extraordinary; so that the Enemy cannot assault them any
where, but he will find them in very good order; neither is the rear in any great danger,
because an Enemy can be hardly so strong as to assault you equally on all sides; if you found
he was so strong you would never take the Field against him. But if he was three times
as many, and as well ordered as you, if he divides, and weakens himself to attack you in
several places, beat him in one, and his whole enterprize is lost. As to the Enemies Ca|valry,
though they out-number you, you are safe enough; for the Pikes which encompass
you, will defend you from any impression from them, though your own Horse be repulsed.
The chief Officers are moreover plac'd in the flank, so as they may commodiously command,
and as readily obey; and the spaces which are left betwixt one Battalia and the other, and
betwixt one rank and another, serve not only to receive those who are distressed, but gives
room for such persons as are sent forward and backward with orders from the Captain:
Add as I told you at first, as the Romans had in their Army about 24000 men, I would
have our Army consist of the same number; and as the Auxiliaries took their method of
Fighting, and their manner of drawing up, from the Legions; so those Soldiers which
you would joyn to your two Battalions, should take their form and discipline from them.
These things would be very easie to imitate, should you have but one example, for by joyn|ing
either two other Battalions to your Army, or adding as many Auxiliaries, you are in
no confusion, you have no more to do but to double your ranks, and whereas before you
put ten Battalia's in the left wing, put twenty now; or else you may contract, or extend
them as your place and Enemy will give leave.

Luigi.
In earnest, Sir, I am so well possess'd of your Army, that I fancy I see it drawn
up before my eyes, which gives me an ardent desire to see it engaged: I would not for any
thing in the world that you should prove a Fabius Maximus, and endeavour no more than
to avoid Fighting, and keep the Enemy in suspence; for I should blame you more, than
the Romans did him.



CHAP. VI.
The description of a Battel.

Fabr.
DO not question it, Hark, do not you hear the Artillery? Ours have fired alrea|dy,
but done little execution upon the Enemy; the Velites extraordinary, to|gether
with the light Horse advance to the charge in Troops, with the greatest shout and
fury imaginable; The Enemies Artillery has fired once, and the shot passed over the head
of our Foot, without any prejudice at all. That it might not have time for a second
Volley, our Velites, and our Cavalry have marched up in great haste to possess it, and the

Enemy advancing in its defence, they are come so close, that neither the Artillery of one
side or the other can do any mischief. See with what courage and bravery our Souldiers
charge; with what discipline and dexterity they demean themselves, thanks to the exer|cise
to which they have been used, and the confidence that they have in our Army: See
our Battalions marching up, with their Drums beating, Colours flying, and men at Arms
in their wings in great order to the charge: Observe our Artillery, which (to give place,
and make room for our men) is drawn off by that ground which was left by the Velites:
See how the General encourages his men, and assures them of Victory: See how our Ve|lites
and light Horse are extended and returned to the flanks of our Army, to see if there
they can find any advantage to make an impression upon the Enemy; Now, now they
are met, See with what firmness our Battalions have received the charge without the least
noise or confusion: Observe the General how he commands his men at Arms to make good
their ground; not to advance upon the Enemy, nor desert the Foot upon any occasion
whatever. See our light Horse marching to charge a Body of the Enemies Harquebussiers
that was firing upon our flank; and how the Enemies Horse come in to their rescue, so
that being enclosed betwixt the Cavalry of one side and the other, they cannot fire, but
are forced to retreat behind their Battalia's: See with what fury our Pikes addres them|selves
to the Fight, and our Foot advanced already so near, that the Pikes are become un|serviceable;
so that according to our Discipline the Pikes retire by little and little among
the Shields: See in the mean time how a Body of the Enemies men at Arms, has disor|dered
our men at Arms in the left wing; and how according to our Discipline, retiring
under the protection of our Pikes extraordinary, by their assistance they have repulsed the
pursuers, and killed most of them upon the place. See the Pikes in ordinary of the first
Battalia's, how they have sheltred themselves under the Scudati, and left them to make good
the fight: See with what courage with what security, with what leisure they put the Ene|my
to the Sword. Behold how they close their ranks in the Fight, and are come up so
near they have scarce room left to manage their Swords. See with what fury the Enemy
slyes, because being armed only with Pike and with Sword, both of them are become un|serviceable;
one because of its length, the other because the Enemy is too well armed.
See how they throw down their Arms, how they are wounded, killed or dispersed. See how
they run in the right wing; see how they fly in the left. So now we are safe, and the Vi|ctory
our own.



CHAP. VII.
The Authors reasons for the occurrences in the Battel.

Fabr.
WHat do you think now, have we not got the Victory very fortunately; but
we would have had it with more advantage, had I been permitted to have
put all things in execution. You see there is no necessity of making use either of the se|cond
or third order; because our Van was sufficient to overcome the Enemy; so that I am
enclined to speak no farther upon this Subject, unless it be to resolve any doubt that may
arise in your mind.


Luigi.
You have gain'd this Victory with so much courage and gallantry, that I fear
my transport will not give me leave to explain my self, whether I have any scruple or not.
Nevertheless presuming upon your quickness, I shall take the boldness to tell you what I
think. First, therefore let me desire you to inform me, why you made use of your Artille|ry
but once? why you caused them to be drawn off into your Army, and made no men|tion
of them afterward? It seems to me that you placed the Enemies too high, and ordered
them as you fancied; which might possibly be true; but if their Cannon should be so pla|ced
(as I do not question but many times they are) as that they should play among your
Troops, I would fain understand what remedy you would prescribe; and since I have begun
to speak of the Artillery, I shall propose all my scruples in this place, that I may have no
occasion to mention them hereafter. I have heard many persons find fault with the Arms
and orders of the ancients, as things of little or no use in our days, in respect of the fury of
our Cannon; because they break all ranks, and pierce all Arms at such a rate, that
it seems to them no less than madness to oppose any ranks or orders of men against
them, and to tire your Souldiers with the carriage of Arms that will not be able to
defend them.



Fabr.
Your demand consisting of many heads, requires a large answer. 'Tis true, I
caused my Artillery to play but once, and I was in doubt whether they should do that;
and the reason is, because it concerns a man more to keep himself from being hurt, than to
mischief his Enemy. You must understand, that to provide against the fury of great
Guns, it is necessary to keep where they cannot reach you, or to place your self behind some
wall or bank that may shelter you, for there is nothing else that can secure you; and then
you must be sure that either the one o the other are able to protect you. Those Generals
who put themselves into a posture to give battel, cannot place their Armies behind a wall
or a bank, or at a distance where the Enemies Cannon cannot reach them; and therefore
seeing they have no way to defend themselves absolutely, the best course is to secure them|selves
as well as they can, and that is by possessing their Cannon with as much speed as is
possible.
The way to possess themselves of it, is to march up to it suddenly, and in as wide an or|der
as is convehient; suddenly, that they may fire but once; and wide, that the execution
may be the less. This is not to be done by a band of Souldiers in order; for if they march
any thing wide, they disorder themselves; and if they run on in a huddle, it will be no
hard matter for the Enemy to break them. And therefore I ordered my Battel so, that it
might do both the one and the other; for having placed 1000 of the Velites in the wings,
I commanded that as soon as our Artillery had fired, they should advance with the light
Horse, to seize upon their Cannon; for which reason our Artillery was shot off but once,
and that the Enemy might not have time to charge the second time, and fire upon us again;
for we could not take so much time our selves, but they would have had as much to do the
same; wherefore the reason why I fired not my Cannon the second time, was, that if the
Enemy fired once, they might not have leisure to fire any more. To render therefore the
Enemies Artillery unserviceable, the best remedy is to attack it with all possible speed; for
if the Enemy deserts it, 'tis your own; if he undertakes to defend it, he must advance be|fore
it, and then being betwixt it and us. they cannot fire but upon their own men. I
should think these reasons sufficient without farther examples; yet having plenty of them
from the ancients, I will afford you some of them. Ventidius being to fight the Parthians,
(whose strength consisted principally in their bows and arrows) was so subtil as to let them
come up close to his Camp before he would draw out his Army, which he did, that he
might charge them on a sudden, before they had leisure to shoot their arrows. Caesar tells
us, that when he was in France, being to engage with the enemy, he was charged so brisk|ly,
and so suddenly by them, that his men had not time to deliver their darts according to
the custom of the Romans. You see therefore that to frustrate a thing in the field which
is to be discharged at a distance, and to prevent its doing you any hurt, there is no better
way than to march up to it with all speed, and possess it if you can. Another reason mo|ved
me likewise to fire my Artillery no more, which may seem trivial to you; yet to me it
is not so contemptible. There is nothing obstructs an Army, and puts it into greater con|fusion
than to take away, or hinder their sight; for several great Armies have been broken
and defeated by having their sight obstructed either with the dust or the Sun: now there
is nothing that causes greater obscurity, or is a greater impediment to the sight, than the
smoke of Artillery; and therefore I think it more wisdom to let the Enemy be blind by
himself, than for you to be blind too, and endeavour to find him. These things consi|dered,
I would either not fire my Artillery at all, or else (because that perhaps would not
be approved, in respect of the reputation which those great Guns have obtained in the
World) I would place them in the wings of my Army, that when they fire, the smoke
might not fly in the faces of my front, which is the flower and hopes of my Army. And
to prove that to trouble the sight of an Enemy, is a thing of more than ordinary advan|tage;
I need bring no more than the example of Epaminondas, who to blind the eyes of
his Enemy, before he advanced to charge them, caused his light horse to gallop up and
down before their front to raise the dust, and hinder their sight; which was done so ef|fectually,
that he got the Victory thereby. As to your opinion that I placed the Enemies
Cannon, and directed their bullets as I pleased, causing them to pass over the heads of my
Foot, I answer, that great Guns do without comparison oftner miss the Infantry, than hit
them, because the Foot are so low, and the Artillery so hard to be pointed, that if they be
placed never so little too high, they shoot over; and never so little too low, they graze,
and never come near them. The inequality of the ground does likewise preserve the Foot
very much; for every little hill or bank betwixt the Artillery and them, shelters them ex|ceedingly.
As to the Horse, especially the Men at arms, because their order is closer than
the order of the light horse, and they are to keep firmer in a body, they are more obnoxious
to the Cannon, and are therefore to be kept in the rear of the Army, till the Enemy has fir'd

 This is most certain, your small Field-pieces, and your small shot does
more execution than your great pieces, against which the best remedy is to come to
-blows as soon as you can; and though in the first some men fell, (as be sure there
always will); yet a good General and a good Army are not to consider a particular loss,
so much as a General; but rather are to imitate the Swissers, who never refused a Battel
for fear of great Guns, but punished them with capital punishment who for fear of them
forsook their ranks, or gave any other sign or expression of fear. I caused my Artillery
to be drawn off as soon as I had Fired them, that they might leave the Field clear for my
Battalions to advance; and I made no mention of them afterwards, as being quite useless
when the Armies were joyned. You have said likewise, that in respect of the violence
and impetuosity of those Guns, many do judge the arms and the orders of the ancients
to be altogether useless; and it seems by that, that the people of late have found out arms
and orders which are sufficient to secure them: if you know any such thing, you will
oblige me to impart it; for as yet I know none, nor can I believe that there is any to be
found: So that I would know of them why the Infantry of our times do carry Corslets
of Iron upon their breasts, and the horse are arm'd Cap a pied; for seeing they condemn
the ancient way of arming as useless in respect of the Artillery, they may as well condemn
what is practised now-a-days. I would understand likewise why the Swizzers, according
to the custom of the ancients, make their Battalions to consist of six or eight thousand
foot; and why other Nations have imitated them, seeing that order is exposed to the same
danger (upon account of the Artillery) as others are. I think it cannot easily be answered,
yet if you should propose it to Souldiers of any judgment and experience, they would tell
you first, that they go so arm'd, because though their arms will not defend them against
great Guns, yet they will secure them against small Shot, and Pikes, and Swords, and Stones,
and all such things. They would tell you likewise, that they keep that close order like the
Swisses, that they may more easily engage the Enemies Foot, that they may better sustain
their Horse, and put fairer to break them.
So that we see Souldiers are afraid of many things besides Artillery, against which they
are to provide by their arms, and their orders: from whence it follows, that the better an
Army is , and the closer and stronger it is drawn up, the safer it is. So that who|
 opinion, is indiscreet, or inconsiderate: for if we see that a small part of the
 the ancients which is used at this day, (as the Pike) and a small part of their or|
( are the Battalions of the Swissers) have been so serviceable, and contributed
 to our Armies, why may we not believe that the other Arms and orders which
, might have been as beneficial and useful? Again, had we no regard to the
 in placing our selves in that straight close order like the Swissers, what other or|
uld make us more fearful? No order certainly can make us more fearful of the Ar|tillery,
than that which keeps men firm and close together. Besides, if I be not frighted
by the Artillery of the enemy when I encamp before a Town, where they can fire upon
me with more security, because I cannot come at them by reason of the wall, nor hinder
them, buby my own Cannon, which will be a business of time; if I be not afraid, (I say)
whore they can multiply their Shot upon me as they please, why should I fear them in the
Field where I can run upon them, and possess them immediately? So that I conclude Ar|tillery,
in my opinion, is no sufficient impediment why we should not use the methods of
our ancestors, and practise their virtue and courage. And had I not discoursed formerly
with you about this subject, I should have enlarged more; but I shall refer my self to what
I said then.


Luigi.
We have heard (or at least it is our own faults if we have not) what you have
discoursed about the Artillery; and that the best course that can be taken against it, is to
make our selves masters of it with as much expedition as we can, if our Army be in the
Field, and drawing up ready to engage. Upon which I have one scruple, because to me
it seems possible that the Enemy may place his Artillery in the flanks of his Army, so as
that it might offend you more, and yet be more capable of being defended. You have
made (if you remember) in the ranging of your Army for a Battel, a space of four yards
from Company to Company, and another space of twenty yards from the Battalia's to the
Pikes extraordinary: if the Enemy should draw up his Army in your own way, and place
his Cannon in those intervals, I believe from those places they might gaul you exceedingly,
and with great difficulty, because you could not enter into the Enemies body to possess them.


Fabr.
Your scruple is rational, and I will endeavour to discuss it, or apply a remedy. I
have told you that those Battalia's are in continual motion, either for a battel, or a march,
and do naturally so straighten and close themselves, that if you make your intervals nar|rower
where you place your Artillery, they will be closed up in a short time, so as they will

not be able to do any execution. If you make your distances large, to avoid one danger,
you incur a greater, by giving the Enemy opportunity not only to possess himself of your
Cannon, but to rout your whole Army. But you must understand it is impossible to keep
your Artillery among your Squadrons, especially those which are upon Carriages, because
being drawn one way, and their mouths lying the other, it is necessary to turn them be|fore
you can fire upon the Enemy, and to turn them takes up so much space, that fifty of
those Carriages are enough to disorder a whole Army. So that it is necessary the Artillery
be placed without their Squadrons; and being so, they may be attacked, as is said before.
But let us suppose it might be placed within the squadrons, and that a way might be found
out of retaining it in the middle, and that it should not hinder the closing of their bodies,
nor leave a way open to the Enemy. I say that even in that case the remedy is easie, and
that is by making spaces and intervals in your Army for the bullets to pass; by which
means the fury of their Artillery will become vain: and it will be no hard matter to do
this, because the Enemy being desirous that it may be secure, will place it behind in the far|thest
part of the intervals, so that to prevent their shot from doing mischief among their
own men, it is necessary that it pass always in a right line, so that by giving place on your
side, it is easily avoided. For this is a general rule, we must give place to any thing that we
are not able to resist, as the Ancients did to the Elephants, and forked Chariots. I believe,
and am assured that you think I have ranged the Armies, and won the day; yet let me tell
you, (if what I have told you already be insufficient) it would be impossible for an Army
so armed and ordered, not to beat in the very first encounter any other Army that should be
arm'd and ordered according to the method of our times; which many times affords but
one front, without any bucklers, and so ill arm'd, that they are not able to defend them|selves
against any Enemy that is near them.
And for their way of drawing up, they do it in such manner, that if they place their
Battalia's in the flank one of another, they make their Army too thin; if they place them
behind one another, not having the way of receiving them into one another, they are all
in confusion, and their ranks easily broken. And though they give three names to their
Armies, and divide them into three Bodies, the Van-guard, Battaile, and Rear-guard, yet
they serve only upon a march, and for distinction of quarters; but in a Fight they are
all at the mercy of fortune, and one small charge defeats the whole Army.


Luigi.
I have observed by the description of the Battel, that your horse were repulsed
by the Enemies Horse, and retired to your Pikes extraordinary, by whose assistance they not
only sustained the enemy, but beat him back again. I believe as you say, the Pikes may
keep off the Horse in a close and gross body like that of the Swizzers; but in your Army
you have but five ranks of Pikes in the front, and seven in the flank, so that I cannot see
how your Foot should be able to sustain them.


Fabr.
Though I told you formerly that in the Macedonian Phalanx six ranks of Pikes
could charge at one time, yet you must understand, that if a Battalion of Swizzers should
consist of a thousand ranks, there could charge at once not above four or five at the most;
because their Pikes being nine yards long, a yard and an half is taken up betwixt their
hands; so that in the first ranks they have free seven yards and an half. In the second rank
(besides what is taken up betwixt their hands) a yard and half is consumed betwixt one
rank and the other, so as there remains but six yards that can be used. In the third rank
for the same reasons there remains but four yards and an half; in the fourth, three yards;
and in the fift but one and an half. The other ranks therefore are not able to reach the
Enemy, yet they serve to recruit the first ranks, as we have said before, and are as a rampart
and bulwark to the other five. If then five of their ranks are sufficient to sustain the Ene|mies
horse, why may not five of ours do as much, having other ranks behind to reinforce
them, and give them the same support, though their Pikes be not so long? And if the
ranks of extraordinary Pikes which are placed in the flanks should be thought too thin;
they may be put into a square, and disposed in the flank by the two Battalia's which I place
in the last squadron of the Army, from whence they may with ease relieve both the front or
the rear, and give assistance to the horse as occasion requires,


Luigi.
Would you always use this order when-ever you were to give the Enemy
Battel.


Fabr.
No by no means; for the form of your Army is to be changed, according to the
situation of the place, and the strength or number of the Enemy, as I shall shew by exam|ple
before I finish my discourse. But this form or model is recommended to you not as the
best, (though in effect it is so) but as a rule from whence you may take your other orders,
and by which you may understand the other ways of drawing up an Army; for every
Science has its Generalities upon which it is most commonly founded. Only one thing I

would press upon you to remember, and that is, That you never draw your Army up so;
as that your front cannot be relieved by your rear; for whoever is guilty of that error,
renders the greatest part of his Army unserviceable, and can never overcome, if he meets
with the least opposition and courage.


Luigi.
I have a new scruple that is risen in my mind. I have observed that in the dis|posing
of your Battalia's, you make your front of five Battalia's drawn up by the sides
one of another; your middle of three, and your rear of two; and I should think it would
have been better to have done quite contrary; because in my opinion an Army is broken
with more difficulty, when the Enemy which charges it finds more firmness and resistance
the further he enters it; whereas it seems to me, that according to your order, the farther
he enters it, the weaker he finds it.


Fabr.
If you remembred how the Triarii (which were the third order of the Roman
Legions) consisted only of 600 men, you would be better satisfied, when you understood
they were placed always in the rear: for you would see that I, according to that example,
have placed two Battalia's in the rear, which consist of 900 men; so that I choose rather in
my imitation of the Romans to erre in taking more men than fewer. And though this
example might be sufficient to content you, yet I shall give you the reason, and it is this:
The front of the Army is made thick and solid, because it is that which is to endure the
first shock and insult of the Enemy; and being not to receive any recruits from elsewhere,
it is convenient that it be well man'd, for a few would leave it too weak, and the ranks
too thin. But the second Squadron, being to receive its friends into it, before it is to en|gage
with the Enemy; it is necessary that it has two great intervals, and by consequence
must consist of a less number than the first: For should it consist of a greater number, or
be but equal to the first, either there must be no spaces or intervals at all, which would
occasion disorder; or by leaving of spaces, they would exceed the proportion of the first
Squadron, which would make your Army look very imperfect. As to what you say
touching the impression of the Enemy, That the farther he enters your Army, the weaker
he finds it, it is clearly a mistake; for the Enemy cannot engage the second body, before the
first is fallen into it; so that he finds the middle Battalion rather stronger than weaker,
being to fight both with the first and second together. And it is the same thing when the
Enemy advances to the last Squadron; for there he has to encounter not only two fresh Bat|talia's,
but with all the Battalions united and entire: And because this last Battalion is to
receive more men, it is necessary the distances be greater, and by consequence that their
number be less.


Luigi.
I am very well satisfied with what you have said; but pray answer me this; If
the five first Battalia's retire into the three Battalia's which are in the middle, and then those
eight into the two Battalia's in the rear, I cannot conceive it possible that the eight Battalia's
first, and afterwards the ten, can be comprehended (when eight or ten) in the same space
as when they were but five.


Fabr.
The first thing I answer is this, That the space is not the same; for the five Batta|lia's
in the front were drawn up with four spaces in the middle, which were closed up when
they fell in with the three Battalia's in the midst, or the two in the rear. Besides there re|mains
the space betwixt the Battalions, and that also which is betwixt the Battalia's and the
Pikes extraordinary; which space altogether, do give them room enough.
To this it may be added, That the Battalia's take up another place when they are drawn
up in order before their retreat, than they do after they are pressed; for in their retreat,
they either contract or extend their Orders. They open their orders, when they fly: they
contract them when they retreat; so that in this case it would be best to contract. Be|sides
the five ranks of Pikes in the Van, having received the first charge, are to fall back
thorow the Battalia's into the rear of the Army, and give way to the Scudati or Shields to
advance; and those Pikes falling into the rear of the Army, may be ready for any Service
in which their Captain shall think fit to employ them; whereas, did they not retire after
the Battel was joyned, they would be altogether useless. And by this means the spaces
which were left to that purpose, are made big enough to receive all forces that are remain|ing.
And yet if those spaces were not sufficient, the flanks on both sides are men and not
walls, which opening and enlarging their ranks, can make such distances as will be able to
receive them.


Luigi.
The ranks of Pikes extraordinary which you place in the flank of your Army,
when the Battalia's in the front fall back into the Battalia's in the middle, would you have
them stand firm, and continue, as two wings to the Army, or would you have them retire
with the Battalia's? If you were willing they should, I do not see how it was possible,
having no Battalia's (with intervals) behind them to give them reception.



Fabr.
If when the Enemy forces the Battalia's to retire, he does not press them too
hard, they may stand firm in their order, and flank the Enemy when the Battalia's in the
front are retired. But if they be charged (as may be reasonably expected) and the Ene|my
be so strong as to force the other, they may retire with them, and that without diffi|culty,
though there be no Battalia's behind with spaces to receive them; for the Body in
the midst may double to the right, and thrust one File into another, as we shall show more
at large when we speak of the manner of doubling of Files. 'Tis true, to double in a
retreat you must take another way than what I have described, for I told you the second
Rank was to enter into the first, the fourth into the third, and so on: But here in this case
we must not begin in the Front, but in the Rear, to the end that by doubling our Ranks
we may retreat, and not advance.



CHAP. VIII.
The Exercises of an Army in general.

Fabritio.
TO answer now to whatever may be objected against my Battel, as I have
drawn it up before you, I must tell you again that I have ordered and en|gaged
it in that manner for two reasons; one to show you how it is to be drawn up; the
other to show you how it is to be exercised. As to the drawing up of an Army, I doubt
not but you understand it very well; and as to the exercising, I must tell you, it ought to
be done as often as is possible, that the Captains may learn to keep their Companies in these
orders; for it belongs to every particular Souldier to keep the orders exact in every Batta|lia;
and to every Captain to keep his Company exact with the order of the whole Army,
and know how to obey the Command of the General. It is convenient likewise that they
understand how to joyn one Battalia with another, how to take their place in a moment;
and therefore it is convenient that the Colours of each Company may have its number of
Soldiers described in it; for the greater commodity of commanding them, and that the
Captain and Soldiers may understand one another with the more ease; and as in the Bat|talia's,
so it is convenient likewise in the Battalions, that their numbers should be known,
and described in the Colonel's Ensign: That you should know the number of the Battalion
in the left or right wing; as also of the Battalia's in the front, or the middle, and so con|sequently
of the rest. It is convenient likewise that there be degrees of Offices and Com|mands
to raise men as it were by steps, to the great honours of an Army. For example,
The first degree should be File-leaders, or Corporals; The second should have the com|mand
of fifty ordinary Velites; The third of a hundred, with the title of Centurion:
The fourth should command the first Battalia; the first, the second; the sixt, the third;
and so on to the tenth Battalia, whose place should be next in honour to the Captain Ge|neral
of the Battalion, to which command no person should be advanced, but he who has
passed all those degrees. And because besides these Officers, there are three Constables or
Commanders of the Pikes extraordinary, and two of the Velites extraordinary, I did not
much care if they were placed in the same quality with the Captain of the first Battalia,
nor would it trouble me if six men more were preferred to the same degree, that each of
them might put himself forward, and do some extraordinary thing to be preferred to the
second Battalia. If then each of these Captains understands in what place his Battalia is
to be ranged, it must necessarily follow, that at the first sound of the Trumpet (the Stan|dard
being erected) the whole Army will fall into its place. And this is the first exercise
to which an Army is to be accustomed, that is to say, to close and fall in one with another,
to do which, it is convenient to train them often, and use them to it every day.


Luigi.
What mark and difference would you appoint for the Standard of the whole
Army, besides the number described as aforesaid?


Fabritio.
The Lieutenant General's Ensign should have the Arms of his General or
Prince, and all the rest should have the same Arms with some variation in the Field or
Colours, as the Prince shall think best, for it imports not much what their Colours are, so
they distinguish one Company from another. But let us pass to the other exercise, in
which an Army is to be train'd; that is in its motions, to be taught how to march, advance,
or fall back with exact distance and time, and to be sure that in their marches a just order
be observed. The third exercise is, Teaching them to manage their Arms, and charge,
in such a manner, as that afterwards they may do both dexterously when they come to
fight; teaching them how to play their Artillery, and how to draw them off when there

is occasion; Teaching the Velites extraordinary to advance out of their places, and after
a counterfeit charge, to retreat to them again Teaching the first Battalia's (as if they
were over-powered) to fall back into the intervals of the second; and all of them after|wards
into the third, and having done so, to divide again, and return to their old posts;
in short, they are so to be accustomed in this exercise, that every thing may be known and
familiar to every Soldier, which with continual practice is easily obtained. The fourth
exercise instructs your Soldiers in the usefulness of the Drums, and Trumpets, and Colours,
informing them of the Commands of their Captain, by the beating of the one, the sound|ing
of the other, and the displaying and flourishing of the third: for being well used to
them, they will understand what they are to do by them, as well as if they were directed
by word of mouth: And because the effects of these Commands depend altogether upon
these kind of sounds, I shall tell you what kind of Instruments the Ancients made use of in
their Wars. The Lacedemonians (if we may believe Thucidides) in their Armies made
use of the Flute, conceiving that Harmony more apt to infuse gravity than fury into their
Soldiers. Induced by the same reason, the Carthaginians sounded their charges upon the
Harp; with which Instrument they began the Fight. Aliatte King of Lydia, in his Wars
made use of them both: But Alexander the Great, and the Romans used Horns and
Trumpets, supposing the clangor and noise of those Instruments would enflame the cou|rage
of their men, and make them more valiant in Fight. But as in the arming of our
Army, we have followed the way both of the Greek and the Roman; so in the choice of
our Instruments of Intelligence, I would follow the Customs both of the one Nation and
the other. I would have therefore the Trumpets placed by the Lieutenant-General as
Instruments not only proper to excite and enflame your Army, but fitter to be heard, and
by consequence apter to derive your Commands than any of the other. The rest of those
kind of Instruments I would have placed about the Captains and Colonels of the Batta|lions:
I would have also a smaller sort of Drums and Flutes, which should be beaten and
played upon not as we do now in our fights, but as our Tabours and Flagelets do in our
Feasts: The General with his Trumpets should signifie when his Army is to make a stand,
when to advance, when to wheel, when to retire, when to make use of the Artillery,
when the Velites extraordinary are to move, and by the variation of the sounds, to direct
his Army in all the Marches and Counter-marches that are generally used; and I would
have the Trumpets followed afterwards by the Drums. And because this exercise is of
great consequence in an Army, it imports very much that it be frequently taught. As to
the Horse, they should have Trumpets too, but of a lesser and different sound from those
about the Lieutenant-General. And this is all that has occurred to my memory in the
ordering, and exercising of an Army.


Luigi.
I beseech you Sir, let me not trouble you too much, if I desire to be satisfied in
one thing more; and that is, for what reason you caused your light Horse and Velites ex|traordinary
to advance against the Enemy with great shouts and clamours, and cries; and
when afterwards the Body and remainder of the Army came to charge, they did it with
extraordinary silence? I confess I cannot comprehend the reason, and therefore I beg your
explanation.


Fabr.
The opinions of the Ancient Generals have been different in that point, whether
an Enemy was to be charged silently and without noise, or with all the clamour could be
made: The silent way is best to keep your men firm in their orders, and to signifie the
Commands of the General: but the obstreperous way is best to excite the courage of your
Soldiers, and dismay the Enemy: and because I thought in both cases there was some|thing
of advantage, I made use of them both, and caused those to advance with clamour,
and these with silence; for I cannot think that an universal and perpetual noise can be any
advantage, because it hinders orders from being derived, which is a most pernicious thing:
nor is it likely that the Romans used those shouts after the first shock, for History tells us,
that many times by the exhortation and encouragement of their Officers, the Souldiers
which were flying, were stopped, and rallyed, and disposed immediately into new Orders,
which could not be, where the Officers could not have been heard.





THE FOURTH
BOOK.

CHAP. I.
The considerations and subtleties to be used in the drawing up
an Army to fight.

Luigi.
SEeing the Victory has been so honourably obtained under my Conduct, I
think it discretion to tempt fortune no farther, knowing how much she is
variable, and inconstant. Wherefore my desire is to resign my Authority,
and that Zanobi may take it upon him according to the Order proposed of
transferring it to the youngest: and I know he will not refuse that honour, (or rather
trouble) both in complacency to me, and as being naturally the more couragious of
the two; for he fears not to engage in these kind of conflicts, though there be as much
likelihood of his miscarriage as conquest.


Zanobi.
I shall refuse no Office into which you shall put me, though I must needs say,
I could more willingly have been an auditor; for your scruples and demands have hitherto
given me more satisfaction, than any thing I could have objected my self. But I think,
Seignor Fabritio, it would be better if you proceed (provided your patience will serve,
and that we do not tire you with our Ceremonies.)


Fabritio.
You rather oblige me Sir, for this variety of Interrogators, gives me to un|derstand
the vanity of your judgments and appetites. But is there any thing behind that
you would have added to what has been spoken before?


Zanobi.
There are two things of which I would willingly be satisfied before we pass
any farther. One is, whether you have any other way of drawing up an Army: The
other is, what reflections or considerations a General is to have, before he comes to a Bat|tel;
and when any accident intervenes, how it is to be avoided.


Fabr.
I shall endeavour to satisfie you, but not by answering distinctly to your de|mands;
for whilst I answer to one, it happens many times that I seem to answer to the other;
I have told you how I would have my Army drawn up, that according to that model, any
other figure may be taken, as the number of the Enemy, and the nature of your ground
does require; for in that case, one is to act according to the condition both of the one and
the other.
But take notice of this, That there is no way more dangerous, than to extend the front
of your Army too much, unless it be very numerous and strong: Otherwise you are to
draw it up close and thick, rather than wide and thin. For when your Forces are few in
respect of the Enemy, you must look out for other remedies: as by drawing your Army
up, so as it may be fortified by some River, or Fen, that may secure you behind; or forti|fied
in the flanks by some Ditch or Entrenchment, as Caesar's was in France; and this ought
to be a general rule to you, that you extend or contract your front according both to your
own number, and the number of your Enemy. If the Enemy be not so numerous, and
your men as well disciplin'd as they, you are to make choice of an open place, where you
may not only encompass the Enemy, but distend your own ranks: For in streight and
narrow places, not being able to make use of your orders, you cannot make use of your
advantage. For this reason the Romans did most commonly make choice of open and
clear places, and avoided such as were difficult and close. But if your Army be small, or
your men inexperienced, you must do quite contrary (as I said before) and must find out
some place where your few men may defend themselves, or where their inexperience may
do you no hurt: In that case you are to choose some hill or eminence from whence you
may come down upon the Enemy with more force; yet must you have this caution not to
draw up your Army upon any Strand or Sea-coast, nor under the command of any Hill,

of which the Enemy may possess himself, because you will be exposed thereby to the Ene|mies
Cannon without remedy, and be unable to do them mischief with any convenience.
In the drawing up an Army for Battel, great regard is likewise to be had to the Sun and
the Wind, that neither the one nor the other be in your face, for they are great impedi|ments
to your sight, one with its beams, and the other by raising the dust, and carrying
the powder into your eyes; besides, the wind being contrary, is a great disadvantage in
rendring the blows which they give the Enemy more languid and weak; and as to the
Sun, your must not only take care that it be not in your face, nor does you no prejudice in
the beginning of the Fight, but that it does you no injury when it gets up: wherefore
the best way is when you draw up your men, to have it if possible on their backs, that
many hours may pass before it can come about into their faces.
Hanibal knew this advantage very well, and made use of it in the Battel of Cannas, and
Marius did the same against the Cimbrians. If you be weaker in Horse, it is your best
way to draw up among the Vines or the Woods, and such other impediments, as in our
times the Spaniards did when they beat the French in the Kingdom of Naples near Cirig|nuola.
And it has been many times seen that the same Soldiers which have been worsted
and bastled before; by only changing their order, and shifting their ground, have recovered
the Victory; Thus it was with the Cartbaginians, who having been many times worsted
by Marcus Regulus, were afterwards Victorious by the Conduct of Kantippus the Lacede|monian,
who caused them to come down into the plain, where they might have room for
their Horse, and their Elephants, and by so doing they were too hard for the Romans.
According to the practice of the Ancients, I have observed, That all great Generals
when they have known which quarter of the Enemy was the strongest, and where they
have fortified most; they have not opposed the strongest part of their Army against it;
but have chose rather to confront it with the weakest of their divisions, and with their
strongest attack the weakest of the Enemies. When afterwards they came to engage,
they commanded the strongest of their Squadrons that they should not only stand firm,
and receive the charge without making any advance, whilst the weaker parts had orders
to suffer themselves to be overcome, and by giving ground gradually, to fall behind the
rear of the Army. The Artifice procures two great disorders to the Enemy. The first
is, that the strongest part of his Army is environ'd insensibly; the other is, that imagining
their Victory certain by the retreat of their Enemy, they fall frequently into disorder, which
many times robs them of that Victory of which they thought themselves so certain. Cor|nelius
Scipio being in Spain against the Carthaginians, under the command of Asdrubal;
and knowing that Asdrubal understood very well that in the drawing up his Army, he
put the Roman Legions (which were the strength and flower of his Army) in the
midst, and that Asdrubal in probability would do the like. When they came afterwards
to Fight, he changed his order, put his Legions in the Wings, and his light arm'd men in
the Body; When the Battel was joyned, he commanded his Body to slacken their march
on a sudden, and the Wings to double their pace; so that only the Wings on both sides
engaged, and the Bodies on both sides being at a distance one from the other, came not up
to one another, and the strongest part of Scipio's Army, fighting better than the weakest
of Asdrubal's, he overcame them. In those days that stratagem was well enough; but
in our days by reason of our Artillery, it is unpracticable; for the space which would be
left betwixt the two Bodies would give opportunity to the Artillery to play, which as we
said before, would be very dangerous: So then that way is to be laid aside; and the way
which I recommended before is to be used, which is to charge with your whole Army,
and let your weakest Squadrons retire. When a General finds his Army stronger than his
Enemies, if he would encompass it insensibly, and that the Enemy may not prevent him,
let him draw up his Army to an equal front with the Adversary: afterwards in the heat of
the Fight let him order by little and little to retire in the front, and let the Wings ad|vance
as gradually, and it will always happen that the Enemy shall be encompassed before
he is aware.
When a General would fight, and be sure not to be routed, let him draw up his Army
near some place of retreat or security, as either Fens, Mountains, or some strong inexpug|nable
Town; for in that case he may pursue the Enemy, but the Enemy cannot pursue
him. Hanibal made use of this cunning when his fortune began to decline, and he began
to apprehend the Conduct of Marcellus. Some Generals to disturb the orders of the Ene|my,
have commanded their light armed men to begin the Battel, and when it is once
joyned, to retire among the ranks. When afterwards it grows hotter, and both sides are
thorowly engaged, they have had orders to draw forth out of the flanks of the Army, and
having flanked the Enemy unexpectedly, they have disordered and broke him. If any

one finds himself weaker in Horse, besides the ways proposed before, he may place a Bat|talia
of Pikes behind them, and draw them up in such manner, that in the heat of the
Battel they may open, and give way for the Pikes to pass thorow them, and by so doing,
he shall be sure to prevail. Several have accustomed their light armed men to fight among
their Horse, and they have been found to give the Horse very good assistance.
Of all those who are famous for drawing up Battels, Hanibal and Scipio are the most
renowned for the great skill that both of them expressed in their conflict in Africa; but
because Hanibals Army was composed of Carthaginians, and Auxiliaries of several Na|tions,
he placed 80 Elephants in his front; behind them he placed his Auxiliaries, next
them his Carthaginians, and last of all his Italians, in whom he could not safely conside:
and the reason why he ordered them so, was because the Auxiliaries having the Enemy in
their faces, and finding themselves closed up with Carthaginians at their backs, should not
think of flying, but being under a necessity to fight, he did hope they might either over|come,
or so harrass the Enemy, that when he came up with his fresh men, he might the
more easily overthrow them. Against this order Scipio placed his Hastati, Principes, and
Triarii in his accustomed manner, so as upon occasion they might be received one into
the other.
The front of his Army he made up with great spaces, but that it might appear close and
united to the Enemy, he filled them up with his Velites, with order that as soon as the Ele|phants
come upon them, they should retire, and entring among the Legions by the or|dinary
spaces, leave a way open for the Elephants to pass, by which means the fury and
execution of the Elephants being evaded, they came presently to handy-blows, and the
Carthaginians were overcome.


Zanobi.
In your description of the Fight, you have caused me to remember how Sci|pio
in the Engagement caused not his Hastati to retire into the ranks of the Principes, but
divided them, and caused them to retire into the Wings of the Army to give place to the
Principes when they were to advance against the Enemy: I would know therefore for
what reason he differed from the ordinary custom.


Fabritio.
I will tell you: Hanibal had placed the strength of his Army in the second
division; so that Scipio to oppose them with equal courage, united the Principes and the
Triarii together, insomuch as the intervals of the Principes being filled up by the Triarii,
there was no spaces left for the reception of the Hastati; wherefore he caused the Hastati
to open to the right and left, and fall in with the Wings of the Army. But you must
observe that this way of dividing the first Squadron, is not to be used but when the other
is Superior; for then you may do it conveniently, as Scipio did; but being inferior or
under any repulse, it is not to be done without manifest danger, and therefore it is necessary
that you have spaces behind in your other Squadrons that may be ready to receive you.
But to return to our discourse. The ancient Asians among other contrivances to mis|chief
their Enemy, made use of certain Chariots with Sythes fastned to the Sides of them,
which served not only to open the Squadrons of the Enemy with their force, but to cut and
kill them with their Sythes. Against these Chariots, they had three ways to defend them|selves;
either by the closeness of their ranks, or by receiving them into their ranks (as
they did the Elephants) or by some other vigorous resistance, as Silla the Roman did
against Archelaus, who had store of those Chariots; to repel them Silla caused several
stakes to be pitched into the ground before his first Squadron, which putting a stop to the
carreer of the said Chariots, prevented the execution which they would otherwise have
done. And it is observable the new method that Silla used in ranging his Army; for
placing his Velites and light Horse behind; and all his compleat arm'd Soldiers before, he
left intervals sufficient to receive them which were behind when they had occasion to march
up; so that the Fight being begun, by the assistance of the Horse (who had room to pass
thorow the first Squadron to the charge) he obtained the Victory.




CHAP. II.
The Arts which are to be used during the Fight.

Fabr.
TO disturb the Army of the enemy when the Battel is joyned, it is necessary
to invent some way or other to affright them, either by spreading a report
of supplies that are hard by, or counterfeiting some representation of them
that may dismay the enemy, and facilitate their defeat.
Minutius Ruffus, and Acillus Glabrio two of the Roman Consuls were skilful in this
art. Caius Sulpitius caused all the boys and refuse of his Army to mount upon mules and
other beasts that were unserviceable in fight, and placed them at a distance upon a hill, and
drawn up in such order that they appeared like a compleat body of horse, when he was en|gaged
with the French, and the enemies apprehension of that body got Sulpitius the Vi|ctory.
Marius made use of the same stratagem when he fought against the Germans: if
then these false alarms and representations are of such use and advantage in time of Bat|tel,
true ones must needs be more efficacious, especially if they fall upon the enemies flank
or rear whilst the battel is joyned: which indeed is not easy to be done, unless the nature
of the Country contributes; for if it be open and plain, you cannot conceal any part of
your Forces, as is necessary to be done in those cases; but in woody or mountainous Coun|tries
you may conceal some of your Troops in such manner as they may fall suddenly and
unexpectedly upon the enemy, which will give you a certain Victory. It is many times
of great importance to spread a rumour abroad during the Fight, that the enemies Gene|ral
is slain, or that he is beaten in another part of the Army, which (as the other) has many
times been the cause of a Victory. The enemies horse are often disordered by the repre|sentation
of strange figures, or the making of some unusual noise, as Croesus did, who op|posed
camels against horse; and Pyrrhus when he confronted their Cavalry with his Ele|phants;
the strangeness of which sight affrighted them so, that nothing was strong enough
to keep them from disorder. In our days the Turk defeated the Sophi of Persia, and the
Soldan of Syria only with the noise of this Guns, which being unusual to their horse, dis|ordered
them in such manner, that the Turk got the Victory, without any great trouble.
The Spaniards to distract the Army of Amilcar, placed in the front of their Army certain
Chariots filled with flax, and drawn by oxen, to which flax (when the enemy came up to
charge) they put fire, and the oxen running from the fire, rush'd furiously into the Army
of Arailcar, and put it to the rout. It is an unusual practice (as we have said before) to
surprize and disturb the enemy with ambuscades where the Country is convenient: but
where it is open and large, many have made great holes in the ground, and covered them
with straw and earth lightly, leaving certain spaces solid and firm for their own retreat;
over which having retired cunningly in the heat of the fight, the enemy pursuing, has fallen
in, and been ruined. If during the fight any ill accident happens that may discourage
your Souldiers, 'tis prudence to dissemble it, and turn it to advantage, as Tullus Hostilius
did, and Lucius Sylla who observing in the heat of the Battel a party of his Troops go
over to the enemy, to the great disheartening of the rest, caused it to be published quite
thorow his Army that it was done by his order, which not only dispelled the apprehension
that was among them, but encouraged them in such manner that it got him the Victory.
Sylla having commanded out a party upon some enterprize, and all of them being killed in
fight of his Army, that the rest might not be terrified, told them he sent them on purpose,
because he had found them unfaithful. Sertorius fighting a battel in Spain, flew one of his
own men, who brought him news that one of his great Officers was killed, and the rea|son
was, lest telling it to the rest, it might possibly have discouraged them. It is no easy
matter to detain and Army, (if it be once tottering and inclining to run) and to bring it to
fight again: but you must consider it with this distinction, either it is wholly disordered,
and then it is impossible to recover it; or else it is disordered but in part, and there is some
remedy. Many of the Roman Generals have stop'd the flight of their Armies, by putting
themselves at the head of them, and as it were upbraiding them by their cowardize. Lucius
Sylla seeing part of his Troops routed, and pursued by the forces of Mithridates, rode up
to the head of them with his sword in his hand, and cryed out to them, If any body ask
you where you have left your General, tell him you left him fighting in Boetia. Attilius the
Consul opposed those who fought bravely against those who ran away; telling them that if
they did not face about, they should be killed by their friends as well as their enemies. Philip
King of Macedon understanding that his Souldiers were afraid of the Scythians, placed be|hind

his Army certain of the faithfullest of his horse, with commission to kill any man that
fled; so that his men choosing to die rather fighting than flying, overcame their adversa|ries.
Several of the Roman Generals have wrested an Ensign out of the hands of their
Souldiers, and throwing it among the enemy, promised a reward to him who should reco|ver
it; and this they did not so much to hinder the flight of their own men, as to give them
occasion of doing some greater exploit upon the enemy.



CHAP. III.
Stratagems after the Fight.

Fabr.
I Do not think it impertinent to add to this discourse such things as happen after
the Fight, especially seeing they are but short, and not to be omitted because they
are conformable to the matter which we have in hand. But since one of these two things
must happen, either that we gain the Victory, or lose it; I say, that when we gain it, we
are to pursue it with the greatest diligence we can, and rather imitate Caesar in this case
than Hanibal, who for not following his Victory, and pushing it on after he had defeated
the Romans at Cannas, lost the whole Empire of the Romans, which fortune had almost
thrust into his hands. Caesar on the other side never rested after a Victory, but followed
the enemy with greater fury than he attacked them at first. But when the day is lost, a
wise General is to consider the best that he can make of it, especially if there be any thing
of his Army remaining.
The advantage that may arise, is from the inadvertency of the enemy, who many times
transported with his success, grows negligent and remiss, and gives opportunity to the
enemy to revenge himself, as Martius the Roman did upon the Carthaginian Army, who
having slain the two Scipio's, and routed their forces, not valuing those which remained,
were suddenly assaulted and broken; for it is frequently seen, nothing is perpetrable so
easily, as what the enemy fancies you can never attempt; for commonly men suffer most,
where they are most secure. A General therefore, when he cannot carry the Victory, is to
endeavour with all possible industry that his loss may be as little as may be; and to do
this, it is necessary to order things so that the enemy may not easily pursue, or be in a ca|pacity
to retard you.
As to the way of hindering the pursuit of the Conqueror; several Generals, as soon as
they found their condition, and that it was not possible to continue the Fight, have order|ed
their inferior Commanders to separate, and fly in several parties, and meet again at a
place which he assigned; and the enemy not daring to divide his Army for fear of a de|sign,
has let all, or the greatest part of the conquered escape. Others have thrown the best
of their goods in the way, that the enemy following might be delayed by the prize, and
suffer them to get off. Titus Dimius used no small art to conceal the loss which he had
sustained in the fight; for having endured the burnt of the Battel from morning till
night with the loss of many of his men; when night came, he caused most of them to be
buried privately: the next morning the enemy finding so many of their own men dead,
and so few of the Romans, concluded themselves beaten, and fled. And now I suppose
(though confusedly) I have in some measure satisfied your demands.



CHAP. IV.
Two other ways of ranging an Army to fight.

Fabr.
'TIs true, as to the form and model of drawing up an Army to fight, it remains
that I let you know that sometimes some Generals have drawn them up in the
figure of a wedge pointing in the front, supposing it the properest way to pierce, and make
an impression upon the enemy. In opposition to this, the way was for the adversary to
draw up in the figure of a pair of shears, which being opened, were to receive the point of the
wedge, enclose it, and charge it on all sides. And about this, let me recommend to you
this General rule, that the best remedy to be used against the design of an enemy, is to do
that bravely of your self, to which you perceive he would endeavour to force you: for do|ing
it voluntarily you do it orderly, and to your own profit and advantage; whereas

if you do it by constraint, you do it to your ruine. I will not repeat any thing that I have
said before, to confirm my discourse. But this is most certain, if your adversary thinks to
open, and as it were cleave your Army with his wedge, if you keep your Army open in the
figure of the shears, and receive them in the middle, you cut them to pieces, and they can
do you no hurt.
Hanibal placed his Elephants in the front of his Army, thinking thereby to have pierced
the Army of Scipio with more ease; but Scipio ranging his men in the form of a pair of
shears, and receiving him in an open posture, gain'd the Victory, and Hanibal was lost.
Asdrubal placed the best and strongest of his men in the front of his Army to make
the better charge upon the Enemy; Scipio commanding his middle men in the front to re|treat
insensibly, and give place, was so cunningly obeyed, that the Enemy was drawn in,
and defeated: so that you see those designs are many times the occasion of his Victory
against whom they are designed.



CHAP. V.
Of the constraint and advantage a man may have to Fight.

Fabr.
IF my memory does not fail, it remains yet that I say something touching the things
which a wise General is to consider before he comes to an engagement. And the
first thing I shall say upon this subject is, that a General is never to come to a Field-fight
unless he be constrained, or has some more than ordinary advantage. His advantage may
lye in the nature of the Place, in the discipline of his Army, or the number or excellence
of his Men. And his necessity consists in finding his condition such, that without fighting
he must be certainly destroyed: as where money is wanting, where victuals are defective,
and where the Enemy is in expectation of supplies: in these cases a General is always to
venture, though he fights upon disadvantage; for 'tis better fighting where fortune may
favour you, than not to try her at all, and be certainly ruined; and in this case it would
be as great a fault in a General not to fight, as it would be if he had an opportunity of de|feating
his adversary, and was either too ignorant to know it, or too cowardly or delatory
to make use of it. The advantages which occur in the conduct of war do many times
proceed from the Enemy, and sometimes from your prudence. Many have been sur|prized
and routed in their passage over Rivers, by the dexterity of the Enemy, who having
forborn them till half of them were over; have fallen suddenly upon them, and put them
to the rout, as Caesar served the Swizzers when he cut off a fourth part of their Army, by
reason that they were separated by a River. Sometimes it happens that your Enemy is
tired, and weary, having followed you with too much haste and inconsideration; and in
that case finding your own Army vigorous and strong, you are not to lose your opportu|nity.
Besides, if your Enemy presents you Battel in the morning betimes, you are not im|mediately
to draw out your Army and fight him, but are rather to protract and spin out
the time for some hours, (still offering and pretending to come forth) that their impatience
of delay, or standing so long to their Arms, may rebate the fury with which they came; and
as soon as you find them cool, and off of their first ardor, then you may come forth, and
charge them as smartly as you can. Scipio and Metellus made use of this way in Spain, the
one against Asdrubal; the other against Sertorius. If the Enemy has lessened his power
by dividing his Army, (as Scipio did in Spain) or by any other occasion, then also a good
General may try his fortune with credit.
The greatest part of the gravest Generals have chosen rather to receive than give the
charge, because the fury of an Enemy is easily sustained by those who stand firm and close
in their station; and being once check'd, it turns into cowardize. Fabius being sent against
the Samnites and the Gauls, received their fury with that indiscomposedness and tranquillity,
that he conquered them both, but Decius his Colleague not following his example, mis|carried,
and was slain. Some who have been possessed too much of the courage of their
Enemy, have chose to begin the Fight in the Evening towards night, that their Army being
worsted, might get off, or defend themselves by the benefit of the darkness. Others un|derstanding
the superstition of the Enemy, and that on certain days they devote themselves
wholly to Religion, and will not endeavour to fight, have chosen that time to attack them,
and have carried the Victory. Caesar made use of this way against Ariovistus in France,
and Vespasian did the same in Syria against the Iews, who upon their Sabbath would not so
much as defend themselves against the Romans.




CHAP. VI.
Directions for a General.

Fab.
THere is nothing of more importance to the General of an Army, than to have
about him persons that are faithful, experienced in war, and prudent in Counsel,
with whom he may constantly advise, and confer both about his own Men, and the Enemy;
as which is the most numerous, which the best arm'd, which the best mounted, which the
best exercised, which the most patient of labour and distress, and whether the Horse or the
Foot are to be relied upon most.
The next thing to be considered is the place where he is, whether it be more advanta|geous
for the Enemy than for him; which is most easily supplyed with provisions; whether
it be best to fight presently, or protract; and what he may gain or suffer thereby: for many
times the Souldiers disgusted at the tediousness of the war, grow lazy and remiss, and
coming at length to be weary, they either grow mutinous, or run away. But above all
things, I would advise a General to inform himself of the nature and qualification of his
adversary the Enemies General, whether he be rash, or wary, and what counsel he has about
him. The next thing he is to consider, is, whether he can confide in his Auxiliaries or
not: and be sure never to bring his Army to a Battel, if he finds them under any appre|hension,
or with the least distrust of the Victory; for the greatest sign of miscarriage, is
despair, and when they think it impossible to prevail. In this case therefore you are to
avoid fighting either by following the example of Fabius Maximus, (who encamped his
Army in places of such advantage, that Hanibal durst not attack him) or else if you suspect
the Enemy will venture upon you in your entrenchments, and that you shall not be able to
defend them, your best way will be to remove, divide your Army, and dispose them in
parties into several Towns, that the tediousness of a siege, and length of time, which will
be required, may discourage the Enemy.


Zanobi.
Is there no other way of avoiding a Battel, but to divide your Troops, and to
dispose them into several Towns?



CHAP. VII.
Which way a Battel is to be avoided, though pressed never so earnestly by
the Enemy.

Fabr.
IF I be not mistaken I have discoursed to some of you before, how he that is in the
field cannot avoid fighting when pressed by an Enemy who will fight upon any
terms; and that the best way he can take, is to keep himself at fifty miles distance, that he
may have time to remove when he hears of his advance. Fabius Maximus did not refuse
fighting with Hanibal, but would fight at his own time, and advantage; and Hanibal was
too wise to attack him, where he was sure he could do no good; for had he believed he
could have conquered him, Fabius would have been constrained to have fought him, or fled.
Philip King of Macedon, Father of Perseus, being at war with the Romans, posted his
Army upon an high mountain, that he might not be compelled to fight; but the Romans
assaulted, and defeated him. Cingentorix General of the Gauls to avoid fighting with Cae|sar
who had passed a river contrary to his expectation, quitted the Country, and march'd
away with his Army. The Venetians in our times, if they had had no mind to have
fought the French King, they should not have staid till his Army had passed the Adda, but
have removed farther off, as Cingentorix did before them; but they staid so long that they
had time neither to draw up handsomely to fight, nor to make their retreat; for the French
were so near before the Venetians dislodged, that the French fell upon them, and put them
to the rout. So then by what I have said, it is manifest that a Battel cannot be avoided,
when the Enemy presses it upon any disadvantage; and let not any body tell me of Fabius,
for Hanibal refused to fight in that case as much as he.




CHAP. VIII.
How Souldiers are to be encouraged to fight; and how they are to be cooled
and asswaged when their courage is too high.

Fabr.
IT many times happens that your Souldiers are impatient to be fighting, but if you
do not find it convenient in respect of the number of your Army, the disadvan|tage
of the place, or some other consideration, you would do well to turn them from that
inclination. It happens again that necessity or occasion constrains you to fight when your
Souldiers are diffident or adverse: in one case it is necessary that you affright them, in the
other that you excite them. In the first case, when remonstrances and exhortations will
do not good, the best way is to suffer some of them to be cut off by the enemy, that those
who have fought, and those who have not, may believe you another time. What Fabius
Maximus did by accident, may be done on purpose, and by art. You know the Army
of Fabius was very fierce to be fighting with Hanibal, and his Master of the Horse was of
the same mind with the Army: Fabius was of another opinion, and thought it better to
protract; and this diversity of opinions occasioned the dividing of the Army: Fabius kept
his division in his trenches, the Master of the Horse went out, fought, was worsted, and had
certainly been cut off, had not Fabius relieved him; by which example the Master of the
Horse, and the whole Army were convinced that their wisest way was to have obeyed the
orders of Fabius. As to the other point of animating your Souldiers, and raising their
courages to a pitch, it is good to incense them by possessing them of the contumacy and
insolence of the enemy: by pretending intelligence among them, and that you have cor|rupted
a considerable party; by posting your Army so near them, that they may see one
another, and skirmish with them slightly every day, (for things which are done daily, we
easily despise) by counterfeiting your self angry, and in a solemn and grave oration repre|hending
and upbraiding their backwardness, and telling them, that if they leave you, you
will charge the enemy alone. But to make your Souldiers bold and couragious, you are
by no means to permit any of them to send any thing to their own houses (or to deposit it
any where else) till the war be done, that they may know that though in running home
they may save their lives, yet it must be with the loss of their prize; the love of which ren|ders
people commonly as valiant as the love of their lives.


Zanobi.
You say that Souldiers may be encouraged, and disposed to fight, by a speech or
oration: do you intend it should be delivered to the whole Army, or only to the Officers?



CHAP. IX.
A General ought to be skilful and eloquent to persuade or dissuade as he
sees occasion.

Fabr.
IT is an easie matter to persuade or dissuade any thing with a small number of per|sons,
because if words will not do, you have force and authority to back them:
but the difficulty is to remove an opinion out of the heads of the multitude when it is con|trary
to your own judgment, or the interest of the publick; for there you can use nothing
but words, which must be heard and understood by every body, if you would have every
body convinced. For this reason it is requisite an excellent General should be a good
Orator, to inflame or asswage the courage of his Souldiers as he has occasion; for unless
they can tell how to speak to a whole Army, there is little good to be expected; and yet
in our times this way of haranguing them is quite laid aside. Look over the Life of
Alexander the Great, and see how often he was put to it to speak in publick to his Army;
and had he not done it, he would never have been able to have conducted it (when laden
with so much riches and prey) thorow the deserts of Arabia, and in India, where it en|dured
so much misery and distress; for there is scarce a day but something or other hap|pens
that causes confusion and ruine to an Army where the General is either ignorant or
careless of speaking to them. The way of making speeches to them takes away their fear,
quickens their courage, augments their confidence, discovers their cheats, secures their re|wards,
remonstrates their dangers, and the ways to avoid them. In short, by those kind
of Orations a General reprehends, entreats, threatens, encourages, commnds, reproaches,

and does every thing that may either enhance, or depress the passions of his men; where|fore
that Prince, or that Commonwealth that should design to establish a new Militia, and
give it a reputation, is to accustom his Souldiers to the harangues of their chief Officers,
and to chuse such Officers as know how to accost them.



CHAP. X.
Certain considerations which encourage Souldiers, and make them as
virtuous as valiant.

Fabritio.
THe worship which the ancients paid to their Gods (though they were false)
Religion, and the Oath which was taken before they were listed in the Army,
was in those days sufficient to keep their Souldiers to their duty; for upon every misdemea|nor
they were threatned not only with such punishments as they were to expect from their
Officers, but such as could be inflicted (as they thought) by nothing but their Gods; which
opinion being tempered with other religious ceremonies and superstitions, made all enter|prises
easie to the Generals of those times, and would do so still, were we as careful and ob|servant
of our Religion as they were of theirs. Sertorious knew how to make his advan|tage
that way, pretending conference with a white Hart, which (as he gave out among his
Souldiers) came from Heaven to assure him of Victory. Sylla to make his designs the more
credible, pretended to discourse with an Image that he had taken out of the Temple of
Apollo, which directed him how he was to steer. Others have pretended dreams and vi|sions
that have commanded them to fight: in the days of our Fathers, Charles the Seventh
of France during his wars with the English, pretended to be advised by a maid that was
sent from Heaven to give him instructions, which maid was called the Pucelle d' Orleans,
and gained him many a Victory. There are other ways of making an Enemy contemp|tible;
Agesilaus the Spartan having taken several Persians, strip'd them naked, and shew'd
them to his men, to the end that seeing the delicacy and tenderness of their contexture,
they might have less occasion to fear them. Some have by design brought their men into
extremity, that they might be necessitated to fight, as having taken from them all hopes of
preservation, but in Victory; which indeed is the surest and best way to make your Soul|diers
fight, and to infuse courage into them, and then this courage and obstinacy is highly
encreased by their confidence in their General, and their love to their Country. Their
love to their Country is natural; their confidence in their Captain is more from his expe|rience
and conduct, than from any thing else. There may be many other obligations, but
none so strong as that which binds you either to conquer, or dye.





THE FIFTH
BOOK.

CHAP. I.
How the Romans marched in an Enemies Country, and in what
manner they are to be imitated.

Fabr.
I Have shown you how an Army is drawn up and marshalled in order to a Battel;
I have told you how an Enemy is overcome, and several circumstances which
occur therein. So that it is time now to inform you how an Army is to be
ordered, which has not an Enemy in view, but is in continual probability of
an assault: This may happen when an Army marches in an Enemies Country, or at least a
Country that is suspected. And first you must understand the Roman Armies had always
some Troops of Horse which were scouting abroad in order to the discovery of the Roads.
After which followed the right Wing, and after them the Carriages which belonged to
that Squadron: Then followed a Legion, and after them their Carriages. Then another
Legion and their Carriages; and after them the left Wing, and the remainder of the Ca|valry
after them. This in short was the manner in which the Romans marched most
commonly; and if it hapned in their march that their Army was assaulted either in the
front or the rear, they caused all their Carriages to withdraw to the right wing or the left,
as they found it convenient, and most agreeable with the nature of the place; and then
when they were cleared of their Baggage, and disincumber'd, all of them unanimously
make head against the Enemy. If they were assaulted in the flank, they drew their Car|riages
on that side where they were like to be most safe, and then addressed themselves a|gainst
the Enemy.
This way being good and well govern'd, ought in my judgment to be imitated, by
sending your light Horse to scout about the Country, and having four Battalions of Foot,
they are to follow one the other successively, each of them with its Carriages in the rear:
And because Carriages are of two sorts, one belonging to particular persons, and others
for the common use of the Camp, I would divide the publick Carriages into four parts,
and assign one to every Battalion; I would likewise divide the Artillery, and the followers
of the Camp into four parts, that each Battalion should have equal share in their impedi|ments
and Carriages. Bnt because it happens many times that you march thorow a
Country not only suspected, but so openly your Enemy, that you expect every hour to be
assaulted; it will be necessary, that to secure your self, you change the form of your march,
and put your self into such a posture, as that neither the Paisants, nor the Enemies
Army may be able to offend you, though they come upon you never so suddenly. In
these cases your Generals of old, were wont to march in a square order, which they called
a square; not that it was exactly of that figure, but because it was ordered so, as it was
able to fight in four places at once, and by that means they were always ready either to
march or to fight. I shall follow this model for ordering my two Battalions which I have
chosen to that purpose in stead of a compleat Army.




CHAP. II
How an Army is to be Marshalled to march in an Enemies Country.

Fabr.
TO march (therefore) securely in an Enemies Country, and to be able to make
good every part when surprized, and assaulted by the Enemy, I am to reduce
my Army into a square according to the model of the ancients; I would have
a square whose area, or vacuity within, should consist of 212 yards, in this manner; I would
first place my flanks distant one from the other 212 yards; I would have five Battalia's in
each flank marching length ways in files, and at three yards distance the one Battalia from
the other; so that each Company taking up forty yards, all of them together (with the spaces
betwixt them) shall take up 212 yards. Between the front and the rear of these two flanks, I
would dispose the other ten Companies, in each of them five; ordering them so, that four
of them should be placed in the front of the right flank, and four in the rear of the left
flank, leaving a space of four yards betwixt each Company, and of the two Companies
that are left, I would have one placed at the head of the left flank, and the other in the rear
of the right. And because the space betwixt one flank and the other consists of 212 yards,
and these Battalia's drawn sideways in breadth rather than length, will take up (intervals
and all) 134 yards, there will remain a space of 78 yards betwixt the four Companies in
the front of the right flank, and the same space will be possessed by the four Companies in
the rear; nor will there be any difference but that one space will be behind towards the
right wing, and the other before towards the left. In the space of 78 yards before, I would
put my ordinary Velites in the space behind, my Velites extraordinary, which would not
amount to a thousand for each space. But to contrive it so, that the great space within
should consist of 212 yards square, it would be convenient that the five Companies which
are placed in the front, and the five Companies in the rear should take up none of that
space which belongs to the flanks; wherefore it is necessary that the five Companies behind
should with their front touch the rear of the flanks, and those five Companies in the Van,
with their rear should touch the front of the flanks; so that there should remain on each
side of the Army, a distance sufficient to receive another Company. And because there are
four spaces, I would take four Ensigns of the Pikes extraordinary, and place one in each
of them, and the two Ensigns which would remain, I would place in the midst of the
space of my whole Army in a square Battalion; at the head of which, the General of the
Army should stand with his Officers about him: But because these Battalia's thus ordered,
do march all of them one way at once, but do not so when they fight; when they are
drawn up, those sides are to be put into a fighting posture, which are not guarded by other
Battalia's: And therefore it is to be considered that the five Battalions in the front are de|fended
on all sides, but just in the front; so that they are to be drawn up in great order
with the Pikes before them. The five Companies behind are guarded on all sides but be|hind,
so as they are likewise to be ordered with Pikes in their rear, as we shall show in its
place.
The five Companies in the right flank are guarded on every side but only on the right
flank. The five in the left flank are the same, only on the left flank they are open; and
therefore in the managing your Army, you must observe to place your Pikes so as they may
turn about to that flank which is naked and exposed; and your Corporals are to be in the
front, and in the rear, that (being to fight) the whole Army, and every Member of it
may be in their proper places, and the manner of doing it, we have declared before, when
we discoursed of putting the Companies in order; I would divide my Artillery, and place
part of it without my right flank; and the other without my left. My light Horse I would
send before to scour the Country; my men at Arms I would dispose part behind my right
wing, and part behind my left, at about forty yards distance, from the Battalia's. And this
general rule you are to observe by all means in the drawing up your Army, that your Horse
are to be placed either in the rear, or upon the flanks, for to place them before, at the head
of the Army, would occasion one of these two things, either they must be placed at such
distance, that upon a repulse they may have space and time enough to wheel of without
falling foul upon the foot; or else draw up the foot with such intervals, that the Horse may
pass thorow without putting them into disorder: Certainly no body ought to look upon
this as a thing of small importance; for many have been ruined and routed by their own
men, for want of timely consideration.

But to return to our business, the Carriages, and the people unarmed are placed in the
void place of the Army, and so disposed, that there is passage left for any to pass from one
part of the Army to another. These Companies (without the Horse and Artillery) do
take up a space of 282 yards: And because this square consists of two Battalions, it is conve|nient
to let you know what part of them makes one Battalion, and what the other. Now
because Battalions are denominated from the number, and each of them (as you know)
consists of ten Battalia's (or Companies) and a Colonel, I would have the first Battalion
place five of first Companies in the front, the other five in the left flank, and the Colonel
in the left angle of the front. The second Battalion should place its five first Battalia's up|on
the right flank, and the other five in the rear, with the Colonel in the right corner to
secure the rear, and perform the office of him whom the Romans called by the name of
Tergiductor.



CHAP. III.
How to put an Army presently into order, and draw it up, so as if upon a march
it should be attack'd, it may defend it self on all sides.

Fabr.
HAving put your Army into this posture, you are to cause it to march, and in its
march observe the same order, for without doubt it is safe enough against the
tumults and incursions of the Peasants, against which, it is sufficient if the Colonel com|mands
out parties of Horse, or certain Companies of his Velites to repel them. Nor is
there any danger that those kind of people will ever come to handy strokes with you; for
men without order, are always fearful of men in order, and 'its the practice of such peo|ple
to alarm you with great shouts and crys, but never to come near; like little Curs
that bark at a Mastiff, but keep far enough off. When Hanibal invaded Italy with so
much detriment to the Romans, he passed thorow France; was frequently infested by the
Bores, but he valued them not. But it is not sufficient to have your Army in this order,
but if you intend to march, you must have Pioneers. and such kind of people to plain the
ways, make your intrenchments, c. and these Pioneers are to be secured by the Horse
which you send up and down the Country. In this order an Army may march ten miles a
day, and be time enough at their journeys end to Sup, and take up their Quarters by day-light;
for many times an Army will march in one day twenty miles. But if it happens to
be attacked by a formed Army, it cannot be so sudden, but you will have time to put your
self into a posture of defence, because an orderly Army marches slowly, and you will have
leisure to draw your self up in Battalia, and put your Army either into the same figures
I have prescribed, or into such another. If you be assaulted in the Van, you have no more
to do but to bring your Artillery thither out of the flanks, and bringing your Horse out of
the rear into the Van, to put them into the same place and distance as I have directed. The
1000 Velites which are before, may advance, divide themselves into two parties of five
hundred a piece, and enter into their own place betwixt the Horse and the wings of the
Army; and then into their place are to succeed the two Companies of Pikes extraordinary
which I placed before in the great vacuity of the Army. The 1000 Velites in the rear are
to remove from their post, and dividing themselves, repair to the two flanks and fortifie
them, and by the space and chasm which they leave at their departure, the Carriages
may march out, and all those who are unarmed, and put themselves behind in the rear:
The space in the middle being now void, and every man in his place, the five Battalia's
which I ordered behind the Army may advance by the void space betwixt the two flanks,
and march towards those in the Van. Three of them may march up within 40 yards
(with equal intervals betwixt the one and the other) and the other two may remain behind
at the same distance of forty yards. This is a form that may be ordered on a sudden, and
has some resemblance with the first model of an Army which we recommended before;
for thought it be streighter in the front, it is firmer in the flanks, and by consequence stron|ger.
But because the five Battalia's in the rear have Pikes with them for the reasons above|said,
it is necessary to cause them to advance to fortifie the front of the Army, and there|fore
either you must cause your Companies to turn Company by Company as they were
solid bodies; or else pass them into the front thorow the files of the Bucklers, which way
is a better way, and less disorderly, than to cause them to wheel in whole Companies like a
solid body: and the same thing is to be done with those in the rear upon any assault, as I
have shown before. If the Enemy presents himself in the rear; you have no more to do

but to face about with your whole Army, and immediately the figure is altered, the rear
becomes the front, and the front the rear; after which you are to observe all the ways of
fortifying your front, as I have directed before. If the Enemy appears upon your flank,
your Army is to face about to that side, and do the same things to strengthen your front:
so that your Horse, your Velites, your Artillery may be in such places as are convenient for
the making up that front; and if there be any difference in this variation of fronts, it is
only this, that some of those who are to remove, have farther to advance than others.
Nevertheless, in making a front of your right flank, your Velites are to enter into the in|tervals
betwixt the wings of the Army and the horse should approach to the left flank,
into whose place the two Companies of Pikes extraordinary (which were placed in the
middle) should succeed: but the carriages should remove, and the unarm'd people, (by the
great space and overture that is made) and retire behind the left flank, which is now be|come
the rear of the whole Army: and the other Velites who were placed in the rear at
first are not to budge in this case, because that place should not remain open, being of the
rear become the flanks: all other things are to be done as in my first directions for the ma|king
of a front.
What is said before of making a front of the right flank, will serve for making a front
of the left flank, for the same order is to be used: if the Enemy comes upon you so strong that
he is able to attack you on both sides, you must fortify the places where you suspect he will
charge, by doubling your ranks from the place where he does not appear to fall on; by divi|ding
your Artillery, your Velites, and your Horse,  distributing them equally in both places.
If he assaults you in three or four sides at once, you or he must be very imprudent; for had
you been wise, you would never have put your self into a place where an enemy could have
come at you on so many sides, especially with a form'd and well ordered Army. For to
ruine you securely, it is necessary the Enemy be strong enough to attack you on all sides
and with as many men in every place almost, as in your whole Army: and if you be so in|discreet
to march into his Country, or put your self into the power of an enemy whose
men are three times as many, and as well experienced as yours, if you miscarry, you can
blame no body but your self: but if misfortune happens not by your fault, but by accident
of war, no body will condemn you, and it will fair with you as it did with Scipio in Spain,
and Asdrubal in Italy. But if the Enemy be not much stronger than you, and yet ventures
to assault you in several places, the rashness will be on his side, and the success in all proba|bility
on yours; for of necessity he must so weaken himself, that you may receive him in
one place, and charge him briskly in another, and then you will easily ruine him. This
way of ordering an Army against an enemy that is not in sight, but is hourly expected, is
very necessary: and it is very useful to accustom your Souldiers to close, and change, and
march in this order, and in their march to shew them how to fight according to my first
front, and then falling into their march again, upon a new alarm in the rear, to turn that
into a front; and then each of the flanks, and so in their first posture again: and these ex|ercises
are very necessary, if you would have your Army ready and well disciplin'd For
which cause I would recommend it to all Princes and great Captains to restore these pra|ctices
of the ancients; for what is military discipline, but to know how to command and
execute these things well? what is a well disciplin'd Army, but an Army train'd up well
in these kind of exercises? and he who in our times would but frame his discipline to this,
I am confident could never be worsted. But to continue our discourse; if this square figure
be difficult, it is not to be laid aside for that, for that difficulty is necessary: nevertheless
exercise will make it easy; for having learn'd how to draw your self up, and preserve your
figure, you will easily understand afterwards how to maintain other figures in which there
is not so much difficulty.


Zanobi.
I am of your mind, that those orders are necessary, and cannot tell (as to my
self) what can be added or substracted. Yet I would willingly be satisfied in two things.
One is when you would make a front of your rear, or one of your flanks, and would have
your men face about, how you do signify your commands, whether by word of mouth, or
sound of trumpet? The other is, whether those you send before to plain the ways, and
make them passable for your Army, are to be Souldiers drawn out of your Battalia's, or
other Country people designed on purpose for that work.




CHAP. IV.
Of Commands derived by word of mouth, by Drums, and Trumpets, and of
the nature of Pioneers.

Fabr.
YOur first demand is of very great importance, for many Armies have been ruined
when the Captain's orders have been mistaken, or not heard: for which reason
the words of Command in such great dangers ought to be clear and intelligible: and if
you would signify your commands by the sound of your Trumpets or Drums, great care
is to be taken, that the sounds be so different and distinguishable one from the other, that
they cannot be mistaken. If your commands are by word of mouth you must use parti|cular,
and be sure to avoid general terms, and in your particular words you must be cau|tious
to use none that may be liable to an ill interpretation. Many times the crying back,
back, has been the loss of an Army: wherefore that word is to be avoided, and instead
of it you are to say retreat. If you would change your front, and make it either in the
flank or the rear, you must not say turn, but face about to the right or the left, to the front or
the rear: and in like manner all the words of command are to be plain and intelligible, as
march on, stand firm, advance, retreat: and what ever may be done by word of mouth
clearly and distinctly, is to be signified that way: what cannot be done that way, is to be
done by the Trumpet and Drum. As to the Pioneers, which is your second demand, I
would have that office performed by my own Souldiers, as well because it was the practice
of ancient times, as because thereby I should have fewer idle persons in my Army, and by
consequence fewer impediments. I would command out of every Battalia what number
I thought necessary; I would furnish them with Pickaxes, and Spades, and cause them to
leave their arms with their next ranks, who should carry them for them; so that when the
enemy appeared, they should have no more to do but to fall back to their ranks, and take
them again.


Zanobi.
But who should carry their Pickaxes and Spades?


Fabr.
There should be Waggons on purpose.


Zanobi.
I fear you would never prevail with your Souldiers to work.


Fabr.
We will talk of that in its proper place: at present I shall lay it aside, and discourse
of the way how they are to be supplyed with provisions; for having tired them thus long,
'tis but reasonable to refresh them with victuals.



CHAP. V.
Of the Provisions that are necessary for an Army.

Fabr,
YOU must know, a Prince is to keep his Army as free, and as fit for expedition as
possible, and to rid it of all encumbrances that may make his enterprizes difficult.
The first difficulty to be removed, is want of provisions, and therefore he is to take parti|cular
care that they be furnished with bread and wine. The ancients did not think of pro|viding
of wine, for when they wanted wine, they made use of water with a little vinegar
to give it a taste, so that among the provisions for the Army, vinegar was provided, but
not wine. Their bread was not baked ready to their hands, as in the Towns, but every
Souldier had his proportion of meal, which he ordered as he pleased, with a certain quan|tity
of Bacon, and Seam, which gave their bread a gust, and rendred them strong. So that
the provision for the Souldiers was meal, vinegar, bacon, and suet or seam, and barley for the
horses. They had commonly heards of Cattel great and small which followed the Armies,
which being driven, and not carried, were no great encumbrance. By reason of this order,
of old, an Army marched many days journey thorow difficult and solitary places without
want of provisions, because they lived upon such things as might easily be carried with
them. But in our Armies now a-days we find it quite contrary; for the Souldiers cannot
subsist without wine and bisket, as when they are at home, of which, provision cannot be
made for any considerable time, insomuch as they are many times famished; or if provision
be made, it is with much trouble, and vast expence. I would endeavour therefore that my
Army might not be supplyed at that rate; nor would I have them have any bread but
what they make themselves. As to wine, I would not hinder their drinking it, nor pro|hibit

that any should come into the Army; but I would take no pains, nor use no industry
to supply them: and for other provisions, I would follow exactly the model of the anci|ents:
which way, if rightly considered, will shew what difficulties are removed, what
wants and distresses are prevented to an Army and General,, and what convenience is ad|ded
to any enterprize that shall be undertaken.


Zanob.
Since we have routed the enemy, and marched afterwards into his Country, 'tis
but reasonable to believe that we have made our depredations, tax'd his Towns, taken
several Prisoners: I would know therefore how the ancients proceeded in these cases.



CHAP. VI.
How the ancients divided the spoil, and of the pay which they gave to
their Souldiers.

Fabr.
I Will satisfy you as to that: I do not question but you have considered (because I
have discoursed it formerly with some of you) how our present wars do impoverish
not only those Princes which are overcome, but those two are Conquerors; for as one
looses his Country, so the other looses his Mony: which was otherwise in ancient times, be,
cause the Conqueror enriched himself by the war. The reason of this difference is, be|cause
in our times no publick account is taken of the prizes, (as formerly) but all is left to
the discretion of the Souldier, which occasions two very great disorders; the first is, as be|fore;
the other, it renders the Souldier more desirous of plunder, and less observant of
order and military discipline. And we have heard of many instances, where their impa|tience
to be pillaging has wrested the Victory out of their hands who had almost perfectly
obtained it. Whilst the Romans had the command of their own Armies, they provided
very well against both these inconveniencies, appointing all the prizes to be delivered in,
and appropriated to the publick, and that afterwards the publick should distribute as it
pleased. To this purpose they had their Questores, (which were like our Chamberlains) in
whose hands all their prizes and taxes deposited, of which the Consul or General of their
Army disposed as he thought good, for the payment of his Souldiers, the curing of the
wounded, or sick, and discharging the other necessities of the Army.
'Tis true, the Consul had power to give the plunder of a Town to his Souldiers, and
he frequently did it, but that liberty never bred any disorder; for when a Town was taken,
or an Army defeated, all the prize was brought into a publick place, and distributed man by
man; according to every ones merit.
This custom made the Souldiers more intent upon victory than plunder: the practice
of the Roman Legions was, to break and disorder an enemy, but not to pursue; for they
never went out of their ranks upon any occasion whatever. Only the horse, the light
arm'd men, and what other Souldiers were not of the Legions, followed the chase: where|as
if the plunder of the field had belonged to any man that could catch it, it would have
been neither reasonable, nor possible, to have kept the Legions to their ranks, or to have ex|posed
them to so many dangers. Hence it was, that upon a Victory the publick was always
enriched; for when a Consul entred in triumph, he brought with him great riches into the
Treasury of Rome, and they consisted of Taxes, Contributions, Ransoms, and Plunder.
The ancients had likewise another custom that was very well contrived, and that was, out
of every Souldiers pay, to cause a third part to be deposited with the Ensign of their respe|ctive
Companies, who never restored it before the War was ended. This they did for two
reasons; first, that every Souldier might have a stock of his own; for most of them be|ing
young, and profuse, the more they had, the more they would have squandred. The
other reason was, that knowing their stocks were in their Ensigns hands, they should have
the more care of him, and defend him with the more courage; and this custom contributed
much to their valour, and is necessary to be observed by any man who would reduce his
Souldiers to the discipline of the Romans.


Zanobi.
I believe it impossible for an Army not to meet with several ill accidents whilst
it marches from one place to another; and that it requires great industry in the General, and
great courage in the Souldiers to prevent or avert them: you would oblige me much if you
would tell me what has occur'd to your knowledg in the case.




CHAP. VII.
To know the surprizes which are contriving against you upon your march.

Fabr.
I Shall satisfy you willingly, as being particularly necessary to any man who is de|sirous
to give a perfect scheme of this discipline.
Whilst an Army is matching, the Generals are above all things to be vigilant that they
fall not into any ambushments, which may be done two ways; one when you fall into it
bluntly of your self: the other when you are drill'd and wheedled into it by the enemy be|fore
you perceive it. To prevent the first way, it is convenient to send out strong parties to
discover the Country, who are to be the more diligent, by how much the Country is more
apt and proper for such things, as where it is woody or mountainous; for ambuscades are
commonly laid behind some hill, or under the shelter of some wood, and, as if you do not
discover them in time, they are very pernicious; so, if your care be sufficient, they are as
easily prevented. The birds and the dust have many times discovered the enemy; for
when ever the enemy approaches in any great number, he will be sure to raise the dust,
which will give you the alarm. Several Generals observing the Pigeons to rise in some
place where they were to pass, (or other birds that fly together in flocks) and to hover over
their heads without falling again, have thereby discovered the ambushments of the enemy,
and either prevented or defeated them.
As to the second way of being drawn in by the artifices of the enemy, you must be cau|tious
of believing any thing easily, that is not reasonable to be supposed: as it would be, if
an enemy should leave something for you to pillage on purpose, you must suspect there is
some design at the bottom, and be careful it does not succeed. If a great number of the
enemy be beaten, and pursued by a few of your men, if a few of the enemy attacks a
greater party of yours, if the enemy runs unexpectedly, and without any visible occasion,
in those cases you must always suspect; and never fancy your enemy so weak as not to un|derstand
his own business: on the contrary, if you would be less exposed to his stratagems,
and run your self less into danger, the weaker and more careless you observe him to be, the
more you are to apprehend him. In this case you are to comport your self in two different
manners, you are to fear him in your own thoughts, and order your affaris accordingly;
but in your words and outward behaviour you are to seem to despise him; this last way
makes your Souldiers more confident of Victory, the other makes you more cautious, and
less apt to be circumvented. And you must know, that to march thorow an enemies Coun|try
is more dangerous than to fight a field Battel.



CHAP. VII.
One is to know the Country perfectly well thorow which he is to pass, and keep
his enterprizes secret.

Fabr.
THe marching thorow an Enemies Country being so extraordinarily danger|ous,
it is necessary that a General doubles his diligence; and the first thing
he is to do, he is to have a Cart made of all the Country by which he is to
pass, that he may know the Towns, their number, and distance, the roads, and mountains,
the rivers, the fens, and the nature and qualities of them all: and to better his knowledg, it
is convenient that he discourses and interrogates some body who understands the places,
objecting, and asking them several questions, and observing their answers. He is likewise
to send some parties of his light Horse before, under the command of prudent Officers, not
so much to face the enemy, as to speculate the Country, and see whether it agrees with his
Map, and the description which he has received. He is also to send out spies and guides
with good guards, promising them rewards if they tell true, and threatning them with pu|nishment,
if false. But above all he is to have a care that his Army knows nothing of his
design; for in the whole Art of War there is nothing so useful, as to conceal the enterprizes
that you are about.




CHAP. IX.
Of certain things which are requisite upon a march.

Fabr.
THat no sudden attack may be able to disorder your Souldiers, you must com|mand
them to stand ready with their arms, for things that are foreseen and ex|pected,
are less terrible and hurtful. Many persons to avoid confusion in their march have
disposed their Carriages, and unarm'd people near the Colours, with command to follow
them close, that upon a halt, or retreat, (if there should be occasion) they might do it more
easily, which is a good way, and I like it well. A General is likewise to have a great care
that his men do not straggle in their march, or march unequally, some too fast, others too
slow, which would weaken his Army, and expose it to great disorder. It is convenient
therefore to place their Officers in the flanks, that they may keep them uniform in their
motion, restraining those who are too hasty, and soliciting those who are too slow, and that
cannot be done better than by the Trumpets and Drums. The ways are likewise to be en|larged
and repair'd, so as one Company at least may always march in order. Besides this, the
custom, quality and humour of your enemy is to be considered, whether he be like to as|sault
you in the morning, at noon, or at night. Whether he be strongest in horse or in
foot, and as you are inform'd of that, you order your men, and provide every thing neces|sary.
But to come to some particular accident.



CHAP. X.
How to avoid fighting near a River, though pressed by the enemy; and in what
manner you may pass it.

Fabr.
IT falls out sometimes that you are forced to decline the enemy, as thinking your
self too weak, and are therefore unwilling to engage him: the enemy follows
you what he can to stop you, or cut you off in your passage over the river, to which you
are marching to that purpose; and your passage will take up so much time, that in pro|bability
the enemy will reach you. Some who have been in that dangerous condition, have
drawn a trench round the rear of their Army; fill'd it with faggots, and other combusti|bles,
and set them on fire, whilst in the mean time their Army passed over without any
impediment from the enemy, by reason the fire that was betwixt them hindred their de|signs.


Zanobi.
I cannot easily believe that such a fire as that could hinder them, because I re|member
I have heard how Hanno the Carthaginian being besieged by an enemy; on that
side where he designed to escape, caused store of wood and faggots to be laid, and then set
them on fire: so that the enemy not observing him so strictly on that side, he passed his
Troops thorow the flames, only by ordering them to hold their Targets before their
faces.


Fabr.
You say well, but consider a little what I told you, and what Hanno did; I told
you that the Generals I mentioned caused a trench to be digg'd, and filled with combustible
matter; so that when the enemy was to pass, he was to encounter with two great difficul|ties,
the trench and the fire. Hanno made his fires without any ditch, and because he de|signed
to pass over them, he commanded that they should not be made too violent; for
without a trench, that would have stop'd him. Do you not know the story of Nabis the
Spartan, who being besieged in Sparta by the Romans, he set part of the Town on fire to
hinder the advance of the Romans, who had already entred in some places; and by that fire
he not only hindred their advance, but repulsed them.
But to return to our business. Quintus Lutatius the Roman, having the Cimbri upon
his heels, and being arrived at a river; that the enemy might give him time to pass, he
pretended a resolution to fight them, pitch'd his Camp, entrench'd himself, set up his Stan|dard,
and sent out parties of horse to provide forrage. The Cimbrians conceiving he
would encamp there, came and encamped by him, and divided themselves into several par|ties,
to supply them with provisions; of which Lutatius having notice, slip'd over the
river before they could have time to disturb him. Some have turned the course of a river,
and by a cut carrying the water on the back-side of the Army, have made the river for|dable,

and passed it with ease. When the waters are rapid and the stream strong, to faci|litate
the passage of the Foot, they put the strongest of their Horse betwixt the stream and
the Foot, to keep of the torrent; and another party below to bear up the Foot, if the
water should be too strong for any of them. Rivers that are unfordable, are likewise to
be passed with Bridges and Boats; so that it is good to carry in your Army materials for all
these things. It happens sometimes that when you would pass a River, the Enemy is got
on the other side, and opposes. To remove this difficulty, I know nothing you can do
better, than to follow the example of Caesar, who having brought his Army to the
side of a River in France, with design to have passed it, but finding Vercingetrix
with his Army on the other side ready to obstruct him, he marched down the Ri|ver
several days journey on one side, whilst Vercingetrix did the like on the
other.
But Caesar having made a place in a Wood convenient for the concealing of some of his
men, drew out three Companies out of each Legion, caused them to stay behind there, and
when he was gone, commanded that they should set up a Bridge over the River,
and fortify it; and in the mean time he followed his march. Vercingetrix observing
the same number of Legions, not suspecting that any part of them were left be|hind,
followed him on the other side; but Caesar when he judged the Bridge finished,
faced about on a sudden, and finding every thing as he expected, he passed the River
without any difficulty.


Zanob.
Have you any rules whereby you may discover a ford?


Fabr.
Yes we have: whereever in a River you see the water tremble, and carry cer|tain
streaks betwixt the place where it stagnats, and the current, you may be sure
the bottom is good, and the place fordable, because the gravel and sand which the
River does commonly carry along with it, is more fixed there, as has been often seen by
experience.


Zanobi.
Suppose the flood should have loosened the earth at the bottom of the ford, so
as the horse should sink in; what remedy then?


Fabr.
You must make grills or lettices of wood, sink them into the River, and let them
pass over them. But to follow our discourse.



CHAP. XI.
How to make your passage thorow a streight though you be
pressed by an Enemy.

Fabr.
IF a General by accident be conducted with his Army betwixt two Mountains,
and that he has but two passages, one before, and the other behind, and the
Enemy has got possession of both, he can have no better remedy than to do as has been
done before; that is, to dig a deep Trench behind him, and make it as unpassable as he
can, that the Enemy may believe he intended to stop him there in the rear, that with his
whole force he might make his way thorow the passage in the Van: Which being observed
by the Enemy, he concluded according to appearance; sent what strength he could make
to the other end of the pass; and abandoned the Trench, whereupon the other clap'd a
wooden bridge over the Trench immediately (which he had prepared on purpose) and
passed back again without any obstruction. Lucius Minutius a Roman Consul was in Ligu|ria
with an Army, and was shut up by the Enemy betwixt the Mountains, so as he could
not disingage himself: being sensible of his condition, he sent certain Numidians which he
had in his Army upon small scrannel Horses towards the places where the Enemy had their
Guards, At first sight the Enemy put themselves into a posture to defend the Passes, but
when they observed the Numidians in ill order, and ill mounted in respect of themselves,
they began to despise them, and to be more remiss in their Guards; which was no sooner
perceived by the Numidians, but they clap'd spurs to their Horses, and charging suddenly
upon them, they passed on in spight of all their opposition; and being passed the mischief
and devastation that they made in the Country, constrained the Enemy to give free passage
to the whole Army. A certain General being infested by a numerous Enemy, drew up his
Army so close, that the Enemy was able to encompass him round, and afterwards he fell
so smartly upon that Quarter where the Enemy was weakest, that he not only worsted
them, but disintangled himself. Marcus Antonius in the retreat from the Parthians ob|served

that every morning by break of day they were upon his back as soon as he moved,
and continued skirmishing and molesting him quite thorow his march; whereupon he re|solved
not to remove before noon. The Parthians observing, concluded he would not
stir that day, and returned to their Posts, insomuch that Marcus Antonius had opportunity
to march all the rest of that day without interruption. The same person to avoid the Darts
of the Parthians, commanded his Men that when the Parthians came near them, the first
rank should fall down upon their knees, and the second rank clap their Bucklers over the
heads of the first rank, the third over the second, the fourth over the third, and so on; so
as the whole Army lay as it were under a Shield, and was defended from their Arrows.
And this is all I can remember about the accidents to which an Army is subject
upon a march. I shall pass now to another thing, unless you have something else to
demand.




THE SIXTH
BOOK.

CHAP. I.
What kind of places the Greeks and the Romans chose out for their Camps,
with a short recapitulation of what has been said before.

Zano.
I Think it very convenient that Battista takes upon him the Office of demand|ing,
and that I lay it down; by doing so we shall seem to imitate the good
Generals of old, who (as I have been taught by Seignor Fabritio) did usually
place the valiantest of their Soldiers, in the front, and in the rear of the Army;
conceiving it necessary to have those in the Van who would begin the fight bravely, and
such in the rear as would bravely maintain it. And as Cosimo began this discourse with a
great deal of prudence, so Battista may finish it with the same; Luigi and I having born
the brunt in the middle as well as we could; and seeing hitherto every man has taken his
part willingly, I do not think Battista will refuse.


Battista.
Hitherto I have suffered my self to be governed, and am resolved to do so for
the future; let me desire you therefore Seignor Fabritio to pursue your discourse, and hold
us excused if we interrupt you with these kind of demands.


Fabr.
As I told you before, you do me a very great kindness, for this interruption, and
changing of persons, rather refreshes than troubles my fancy: But to follow our business,
I say, that it is now high time that we dispose our Army into its quarters, for you know
every thing desires rest, and security; for to repose without security, is not properly to
repose. I do fancy you would rather have had me lodg'd my Army first, and march'd and
fought them afterwards, but we have done quite contrary, and indeed not without neces|sity;
for being to show how an Army in a march was to quit that form, and put it self in|to
a posture to fight, it was necessary first to show how they were to be drawn up for a
Battel. But to return, I say, that if you would have your Camp safe, you must have it
strong, and well ordered: The discretion of the General puts it in good order, but it is art
or situation that makes it defensible and strong. The Grecians were so curious in this
point, that they would never encamp but where there was some River, or Wood, or Bank
or other natural rampart to defend them: But the Romans stood not so much upon the
strength of the situation, as their own ways of fortification, nor would they ever encamp,
but where according to their own Discipline they could draw up their Army. For this rea|son
the Romans observed one constant form in their encampments; for they would rather
make the situation of the place comply with their methods, than permit their customs, to

comply with the situation; but with the Grecians it was otherwise, because following the
condition and form of the place, it was necessary that they varied the manner of their en|campment,
and the form of their Camp. The Romans therefore where the situation was
weak, supplyed it by art and industry: And because in this discourse I have proposed the
Romans for a President, I shall not leave them in my manner of encampment, nevertheless
I shall not follow their practice in every thing, but picking and selecting such parts as I
think most agreeable with our times. I have told you often how the Romans in their Con|sular
Armies had two Legious of Romans, consisting of about 11000 Foot, and 600 Horse;
they had moreover about 11000 more Foot, sent in by their Friends and Allies to their as|sistance:
but this was a rule, their Auxilaries never exceeded the number of the Legions,
unless it were in Horse, and in them they were not so curious. I have told you likewise
how in all their battels their Legions were placed in the middle, and their Auxiliaries in
the flanks, and it was the same in their encampments, as you may read in such Authors as
make any mention of their History: I will not therefore be so exact in my relation, I shall
content my self only to tell you in what order I would lodge my Army at present, and you
will understand by that what I have borrowed from the Romans. You know that in
imitation of their Legions I have taken two Battalions consisting of 6000 Foot, and 300
Horse of service for the Battalion: you know into what Companies, into what Arms, and
into what names I divided them. You know how in ordering my Army to march and to
fight, I have said nothing of more men, only what was to be done, was to be done by
doubling their ranks, not by any reinforcement of men. But being now to shew you the
manner of encamping, I think it not convenient to stick to my two Battalions, but to unite
our whole Army, composed according to the model of the Romans of two Battalions,
and as many Auxiliaries, which I do the rather, that the form of our Camp may be the
more compleat, by the reception of a compleat Army; which in my other demonstrations
I have not thought altogether so necessary. Being therefore to lodge a compleat Army of
24000 Foot, and two thousand Horses of service, to be divided into four Battalions, (two
of Natives, and two of Strangers) I would take this way.



CHAP. II.
The form of a Camp.

Fabr.
HAving found a place convenient for my Camp, I would set up my Standard in
the midst of a square of fifty yards deep. The four sides of that square should
respect the four quarters of the World, and look East, West, North, and South. In this
square I would set up the Generals Pavilion: and because I think it discreet, and in part
the practice of the Ancients, I would divide my men which carry arms, from them who
have none; and those who are free, from those who are incumbred. All or the greatest
part of my arm'd men I would lodge towards the East; my men that were disarm'd and
incumbred, I would lodge towards the West, making my front towards the East, and my
rear towards the West; and the North and South should be my flanks. To distinguish the
quarters of those which bore arms, I would take this course, I would draw a line from the
Standard towards the East of 680 yards long. Then I would draw two other lines,
(with the first in the middle) of the same length, but each of them at a distance of fifteen
yards from the first; at the end of these lines I would have my Eastern Port, and the space
betwixt the two outward lines should make a Street which should go from that Gate to the
General's quarters, and take up a space of thirty yards in bredth, and 630 in length, (for
the General's quarter would take up fifty) and this should be called the General's street.
Then I would cause another street to be drawn out from North to South, and it should pass
by the end of the General's street, not far from the General's quarter towards the East,
which should contain in length 1250 yards, (for it should take up all the bredth of the
Camp) and be called the Cross-street. Having design'd the General's quarters, and these
two Streets, I would mark out quarters for the two Battalions that were my own Subjects,
and one of them I would dispose on the right hand of the General's street, and the other
on the left. And then passing over the Cross-street, I would assign 32 lodgments on the
left hand of the General's street, and as many on the right, leaving betwixt the sixteenth and
seventeenth lodgment a space of thirty yards wide, as a traverse way to pass thorow all the
lodgments of the Battalions. I would lodge the Captains of the men at Arms at the front of
those two orders of lodgments which joyn to the Cross-street, and their men at Arms in

the fifteen lodgments that are next them; so as every lodgment should contain ten men at
Arms, the whole number that I have allotted to each Battalion, being an hundred and fifty.
The Captains lodgments should orty yards wide, and ten in lenght; and you must take
notice that when I say wide, I mean from North to South; and when long, from East to
West. The lodgment for the private men at arms should be fifteen yards long, and thirty
wide. In the other fifteen lodgments which follow on both sides of the street, (which be|gin
at the traverse way, and should have the same allowance of ground as I have given to
the other) I would dispose my light horse. And because there are likewise of them be|longing
to each Battalion 150, I would put ten of them into each of the fifteen lodgments,
and the sixteenth I would reserve for the Captain with the same space of ground as is al|lowed
to the Captain of the men at arms; and so the lodgments of the horse of the two
Battalions should come down to the middle of the General's Street, and be a direction to
the quartering of the foot, as I shall shew. You have seen how I have lodged the 300
horse of both Battalions, with their Officers in 32 lodgments set up near the General's
Street, and beginning at the Cross-street; and how betwixt the sixteenth and the seven|teenth
there was resrved a space of thirty yards to make a cross-way. Being therefore
to lodge the twenty Battalia's or Companies in the two ordinary Battalions, I would ap|point
lodgments for every two Battalia's behind the lodgments of the horse, and they
should each of them contain in length 15 yards, and in bredth thirty, according to the
dimensions of the horse-lodgment, and they should be so close that they should touch
one another.
In the first lodgment on each side butting upon the Cross-street, I would lodge the Cap|tain
of each Company over against the lodgment of the Captain of the men at Arms:
and this lodgment alone should be twenty yards wide, and ten long. In the other fifteen
lodgments which succeed on both sides as far as the traverse way, I would quarter a Com|pany
of foot, which being 450, should be disposed 30 to a lodgment. The other 15
lodgments should be set up on each side by the lodgments of the light horse, with the
same dimensions of ground; and on each side I would place a Battalia of foot.
In the last lodgment on each side I would place the Captain of the Company (right
over against the Captain of the light horse) with a space of ten yards in length, and twen|ty
in bredth: and so these two first ranks of lodgments would be half horse, and half
foot: but because (as I said before) these horses are all horses of service, which have no
proper persons either to dress or to feed them, I would have the foot which are quartered
behind, obliged to look to them, and for so doing they should be exempt from other du|ties
in the Camp; and this was the method of the Romans. After this I would leave a
space of thirty yards on each side, which should make streets, and be called, one of them,
the first Street on the left hand, and the other the first Street on the right. I would then
on each side set up another row of 32 lodgments, with their backs one to the other, with
the same spaces as I assigned to the other; and having separated sixteen of them, (as with
the rest) to make a traverse way, I would dispose in each side four Companies with their
Captains at the head of them, and other Officers in the rear. After I had left on both
sides a distance of thirty yards for a way, which on one side should be called the second
Street on the right hand, and on the other side the second Street on the left hand; I would
set up another rank of 32 lodgments with the same distances and separations, where I
would lodge on each side four Companies with their Officers: and by doing this, all the
Cavalry, and the Companies of both the Battalions would be lodged in three rows of
lodgments, and the General's quarter in the middle. The two Battalions of Auxiliaries
(having made them to consist of the same number of men) I would quarter on both
sides of the two ordinary Battalions, with the same number of rows, and in the same or|der
as they, placing first one order of lodgments consisting half of horse, and half of foot,
distant from the next order thirty foot, which distance should make a Street, and be called
on one side, the third Street on the right hand; and on the other side the third Street on
the left hand. And then I would make on each side two more rows of lodgments with
the same distances and distinctions as in the lodgments of the other Battalions, which
should make two other Streets, and be called according to their number, and the hand on
which they are placed; so that this whole Army will be lodged in twelve double rows of
lodgments, and there will be thirteen Streets, reckoning the General's Street, and the Cross-street:
when I have design'd my circumference, and appointed my lodgments for my four
Battalions, I would leave a space betwixt the lodgments and the trenches of an hundred
yards broad, which should go round my Camp: and if you compute all the spaces, you
will find that from the middle of the General's lodgment, to the East Gate, are 680 yards.
There are two other spaces, one from the General's quarter to the South Gate, and the

other from the same place to the North Gate, each of them 635 yards commencing at the
Center. Substracting afterwards from each of these spaces fifty yards for the General's quar|ter,
and five and forty more on each side for a Piazza, and thirty yards for a Street that di|vides
each of the said spaces in the middle; and an hundred yards round betwixt the lodg|ments
and the trenches; there remains on all sides for lodgments a space of four hundred
yards wide, and an hundred long, measuring the lenght with the space which is taken up by
the General's quarter; then dividing the said length in the middle, there will be on each
side of the General forty lodgments, in length fifty yards, and twenty wide, which in all will
be 80, in which the general Officers of the Battalions should be quartered; the Trsu|rers,
the Mastres de Campe, and all such as have any Office in the Army, leaving some spaces
empty for strangers, or such Voluntiers as follow the Wars meerly out of affection to the
General: on the back-side of the General's quarters I would make a Street from South
to North thirty yards broad, and it should be called Front-street, and run along all the 80
lodgments abovesaid. From this Front-street, by the General's quarter I would have ano|ther
Street that should go from thence to the West Gate, thirty yards wide, answering
both for situation and length to the General's Street, and it should be called the Piazza-Street.
Having settled these two Streets, I would order a Piazza or Market-place, and it
should be at the end of the Piazza-street over against the General's lodging, and not far
from the Front-street. I would have it square, and every square to contain 121 yards:
on the right and left hand of this Market-place I would have two rows of lodgments, each
of them double, and consisting of eight lodgments, in length twelve yards, and in bredth
thirty: so that on each side of the Piazza I would have sixteen lodgments, with that in
the middle, so that in all they would be 32; in which I would place those horse which re|main
undisposed of, that belong to the Auxiliary squadrons: if these would not be suf|ficient
to receive them, I would consign them some of the lodgments about the General's
quarters, especially those which look towards the trenches. It remains now that we lodge
the Pikes, and the Velites extraordinary which I have assigned to each Battalion, which as
you know consisted (besides the ten Companies) of a thousand Pikes extraordinary, and
five hundred Velites. So that the two Battalions had 2000 Pikes extraordinary, and 1000
Velites extraordinary, and the Auxiliaries had the same, so that we have still 6000 foot
to lodge, which I would dispose in that part toward the West, and along the ditch. From
the end of the Front-street towards the North, leaving a space of 100 yards betwixt that
and the ditch, I would have a row of five double lodgments, which should contain in
length all of them 75 yards, and 60 in bredth: so as when the bredth is divided, there
shall belong to each lodgment 15 yards in length, and thirty in breadth; and because there
will be but ten lodgments in this rank, there shall be lodged 300 foot, 30 in a lodgment.
After that, leaving a space of 31 yards; I would set up in the same manner, and with the
same distances another row of five double lodgments, and after that another, till they came
to be five rows of five double lodgments, in all fifty, placed in a right line from the North,
all of them ten yards from the foss, and should entertain 1500 foot. Turning then to|wards
the West Gate, in all that space from them to the said Gate, I would have five other
double orders, in the same manner, and with the same spaces, (but with a distance of but
15 yards from one row to another) where I would lodge 1500 foot more. And so all the
Velites, and Pikes extraordinary of both the proper Battalions should be lodged from the
North Gate to the West Gate, according to the turning of the trenches, and should be di|stributed
into 100 lodgments in ten rows, ten lodgments in a row. The Pikes and the
Velites extraordinary of the two Auxiliary Battalions should be lodged in the same man|ner
betwixt the West Gate and the South, as the trenches incline in ten rows, ten lodgments
in a row, as I said of the other: the Captains or their Lieutenants may take such quarters
as they think most convenient on that side towards the trenches. The Artillery I would
dispose every where upon the banks of the trenches, and in all the other space which re|mains
towards the West I would bestow all the baggage, and servants, and impediments of
the Army. By impediments you must understand (and you know it very well) the anci|ents
intended all their train, and whatever else was necessary for an Army, besides the Soul|diers,
as Carpenters, Smiths, Shoomakers, Engineers, and Cannoneers, (though these in|deed
might be numbred among the Soldiers) Butchers with their Beefs and their Muttons,
Cooks, Pastry-men, and all that prepared meat for the Army; and in short, all other pro|fessions
which followed the Camp for subsistence: they reckoned likewise among them all
the carriages for publick provisions, and arms. I would not make any particular distinction
of lodgments, only I would order the Streets so as that they might not be taken up by
them. As to the other spaces betwixt the Streets, which would be four in all, I would con|sign
them in general to all the said impediments, that is, one to the Butchers, another to

the Artificers and Masters of several Professions; a third to the carriages for Provisions; a
fourth for the carriages for Arms. The Streets that I would have left free, should be the
Street to the Piazza; the Front-Street, and another Street called the middle Street, which
should begin in the North, and pass thorow the middle of the Market-street (or Street to
the Piazza) towards the South, which on the West side should do the same service as the
Traverse-street does on the East. And besides this, I would have another back-street along
by the lodgments of the Pikes and the Velites extraordinary, and I would have all these
Streets thirty spaces wide. The Artillery I would place afterwards upon the trenches on
the hinder part of the Camp.


Battista.
I do acknowledge my ignorance, nor do I think it reproachful where it is not
my profession to be otherwise: nevertheless I am very well pleased with your order, only
I would desire you to resolve me two doubts: one is, why you make the Streets and the
spaces about the lodgments so large; the other (which troubles me most) is, how you
would employ the spaces which you design for the lodgments.


Fabr.
You must understand I assign 30 yards to the breadth of the Streets, that a Battalia
of foot may march together a breast; for (if you remember) I told you often that each
Company took up in breadth betwixt 25 and 30 yards. That the space betwixt the trench
and the lodgments should be 100 yards broad, is very necessary for drawing up the Batta|lia's,
managing the Artillery, conveying and disposing of the booty, besides the conveni|ence
of retiring upon occasion, and making new Ramparts, and new Intrenchments with|in.
Moreover, the lodgments are better at that distance from the trenches, as being farther
from fire-works and other things which an enemy might cast in among them: as to your
second demand, I do not intend that every space that I have designed for a lodgment should
be covered with one Tent, or one Pavilion only, but that it should be employed as is most
commodious for those who are to lodge there with more or fewer Tents as they please, pro|vided
they do not exceed their allowance of ground.
To make a just distribution of these lodgments, you must have persons that are well
vers'd and experienced in that affair, and good Architects, who as soon as the General has
made choice of his place, can immediately put it into form, distribute the lodgments by
dividing the Streets, and distinguishing the places for the several lodgments with a cord
and pikes thrust into the ground, with so much dexterity, that all things shall be presently
in order. And if you would prevent confusion, you must turn your Camp always one
way, that every man may know in what Street, and in what quarter he may find his Tent.
This must be observable in all times and places, and in such manner that it may seem a moving
City, which, where-ever it moves, carries with it the same Gates, the same Streets, the
same Houses, and the same Figure; which is a thing that cannot be practised by those who
make choice of places of natural strength, for they must frame their Camp according to
the variety of the situation. But the Romans fortified their Camps with Trenches, and
Ramparts, and Mounts; for they left a good space round about their Camp, and before it
they made a ditch commonly six yards wide, and three yards deep. They made these spaces
greater or less, according to the time which they design'd to stay there, or according to
their apprehension of the Enemy: for my own part I would not enclose my Camp with
Stoccado's, unless I intend to winter in it: I would have my Trench and my Parapet not
less than theirs, but bigger upon occasion. Upon every corner and side of the Camp I
would raise a kind of half-moon, from whence my Artillery might play, and flank any Ene|my
that should attempt the ditch. In this exercise, to understand how to mark out a Camp,
your men are to be trained frequently, and your other Officers are by practice to be made
ready in designing, and your Soldiers as dexterous in knowing their own quarters, nor
is there any great difficulty in it, as I shall shew else-where, for at present I shall pass to
the Guards of the Camp, because without them all the other pains and punctilio's would
be vain.


Battista.
Before you proceed to the Guards, I would be informed when you would
pitch your Camp near your Enemy, what method you would use; for I cannot imagine
that you should have time enough to do it without manifest danger.


Fabr.
You must know no man incamps near an Enemy, but he who is desirous to
fight when ever the Enemy will give him opportunity; and when the Enemy is disposed to
it as well as he, the danger is no more than ordinary; for two parts of the Army are
drawn out to fight, and the third orders the Camp. In this case the Romans committed
the fortification and ordering of their Camp to the Triarii; whilst the Principes and Ha|stai
stood to their Arms. And this they did, because the Triarii being to fight last, had
time (if the Enemy advanced) to leave their work, stand to their Arms, and fall every
man into his place.

You, if you would imitate the Romans, must cause your Camp to be made by
the Battalia's in your Rear, which are instead of the Triarii; but now to the Guards of
the Camp.



CHAP. III.
Of the several Watches and Guards about the Camp.

Fabr.
I Do not remember in History to have found that the Ancients for the security of
the Camp in the night, did ever make use of out Guards or Sentinels without
the Ditches, as we do now. The reason, as I take it, was because they thought the Army
thereby might be easily surprized, by the difficulty of discerning their Sentinels, and Scouts;
besides their Sentinels might be over-powred or corrupted by the Enemy, so that to rely
upon them either in part or in whole, they concluded would be dangerous: wherefore all
their Guards were within their Trenches, placed with such diligence and exactness, that
it was no less than death for any man to desert his post. How these Guards were disposed
by them, I think it unnecessary to relate, because if you have not seen it already, you may do
it when you please; only this I shall tell you in short what I would do in the Case. I would
have every night one third of the Army in Arms, and of them a fourth part upon the
Guard, distributed all along the works, and in all convenient places quite thorow the
Camp: with a main Guard in each of the four quarters of your Camp, of which a party
should remain constantly upon the Guard, and another party should Petrole from one
quarter to the other. And this order I would use likewise in the day time, if my Enemy
was near. As for giving the word, and changing it every night, and other things which
are observable in the like cases, I shall pass them by as notorious and known. One thing
only I shall mention, as being of importance, and that which brings much advantage to
any man that uses it, and as much disadvantage where it is neglected.



CHAP. IV.
To observe who goes and comes to the Camp.

Fabr.
HE who would be secure in his Camp, is to require notice with great exactness
of all strangers that lodge in his Camp, and to have a strict account of all
goers and comers; and this no hard matter to do, if the Tents be but viewed all along as
they stand in their orders; because every lodgment had its precise and definitive number,
and when you find them more or less than their proportion, let them be examined and
punished. He who observes this course exactly, shall keep the Enemy from practising
your Officers (at least without great difficulty) or from having knowledge of your affairs.
Had not the Romans been very exact observers of this course, Claudius Nero (when Hani|bal
lay so near him) could never have stole so privately from his Camp in Lucania, and
have marched into la Marca, and back again, before Hanibal had missed him.



CHAP. V.
Of Military Iustice, and the methods used by the Ancients in the
punishment of Offenders.

Fabr.
BUt it is not enough to contrive good orders, unless they be strictly observed, for
severity is no where so requisite as in an Army: wherefore to keep your Soldiers
to their duty, strict and severe Laws are to be made, and they are to be executed as strictly:
The Romans punished it with death to be absent from the Guard, when it was a mans
duty to be there. It was no less capital to abandon the place assigned him in Battel. To
carry any thing privately out of his Quarters. To boast and appropriate to himself some
great exploit, which he never did. To fight without the General's order. To throw
away ones Arms in fear. If at any time it happened a whole Troop or Company had of|fended

in that nature, they were all put to death, but an imbursation was made of their
names, and drawing them out by lotts, every tenth man was executed. And this way of
Decimation was used, that though all were not actually sensible, yet all might be affrighted.
But because where the punishments are great, the rewards ought to be proportionable, that
men may be as well encouraged as deterred, they ordain'd recompences for every remarka|ble
exploit. As to him who in the fight, saved the life of a Citizen. He who first scal'd
the Walls of an Enemies Town. He who first entred into the Enemies Camp. He who
wounded or killed the Enemies General, or dismounted him from his Horse. By this
means no signal act was performed, but it was recompensed by the Consul, and applauded
publickly by the rest: and those who received any of these prizes for any generous act,
(besides the glory and fame which they acquired among their fellow Soldiers) when they
returned home into their Country, they exhibited them to the view of their Relations and
Friends, and were received with great acclamation. It is not then to be admired if that
people extended its Empire so far, being so far in their discipline, and in the observation
of their punishments and rewards, towards such as by the generosity of their actions had
merited the one, or by their offences the other; of which things I am of opinion the
greatest part should be observed now. I think it not amiss to mention one of their punish|ments,
and it was this; The Criminal being convict before the Tribune or Consul, was by
him strook gently over the shoulders with a rod, after which the Malefactor had liberty to
run, but as he had liberty to run, so the rest of the Soldiers had liberty to kill him if they
could; so that immediately some threw stones at him, some darts, some stroke him with
their Swords, some with one thing, some with another, so that his life was but short, for
seldom any escaped, and those who did escape could not return to their houses, but with
so much ignominy and scandal, that they had much better have died. This sort of punish|ment
is in some measure used still by the Swissers who cause those who are condemned, to
pass thorow the Pikes, which is a punishment well contrived, and most commonly well
executed; for he who would order things so that a man should not side, or defend a Male|factor,
cannot do better, than to make him an instrument of his punishment; because with
another respect he favours, and with another appetite he desires his punishment, when he
is Executioner himself, than when the execution is committed to another. To the end
then that a Malefactor may not be favoured by the people, nor upheld in his offence, the
best remedy is to refer him to their judgment. To confirm this, the example of Manlius
Capitolinus may be brought, who being accused by the Senate, was defended by the people,
till they were made his Judges; but when his case fell once into their Cognizance, and they
were made Arbitrators in the business, they condemn'd him to death. This then is the
true way of punishing, to prevent Seditions, and execute Justice. But because neither fear
of the Laws, nor reverence to men was sufficient to keep Soldiers to their duties, and to a
just observation of their discipline, the Ancients added the fear and authority of God. For
this cause they made their Soldiers to swear with great Ceremony and Solemnity to preserve
their discipline, that if they transgress'd they might be in danger not only of humane
Laws, but divine Justice, endeavouring by all industry to possess them with principles of
Religion, however they were false.


Battist.
I pray satisfie me whether the Romans permitted any Women in their Armies,
and whether they suffered their Soldiers to game, as we do now adays in ours.



CHAP. VI.
The Ancients had neither Women, nor Gaming in their Armies; and
of the manner how they discamp'd.

Fabr.
THe Romans allowed neither the one nor the other, and indeed it required no
great difficulty to prevent them; for to speak truth, the exercises to which
they kept the Soldier constantly, either in parties, or together were so many that they had
no time either for dalliance or play, nor for any thing else that could make them mutinous
or unserviceable.


Battista.
What you say pleases me very well: But pray tell me when your Army Dis|camps,
what orders do you observe?


Fabritio.
The General's Trumpet sounds three times: The first sound they take down
the Tents, and the Pavillions, and pack them up: The second sound they load their
Sumpters; and the third they march in the same order as I said before, with their Baggage

and Train behind every Battalia, and the Legions in the midst. Then the Auxiliary Bat|talion
moves, and it's Baggage and Train after it, and a fourth part of the common Bag|gage
and Train, which should consist of all those who were lodged in either of the quarters,
which I have shown before in the description of my Camp. Wherefore it was convenient
that each of the said quarters should be assigned to a Battalion, that upon the motion of the
Army every man might know in what place he was to march. So that every Battalion was
to march with its own Baggage, and a fourth part of the common Baggage behind it, and
this was the manner which the Roman Army observed in its march, as you may understand
by what we have said.


Battista.
Tell us I beseech you, in the placing of their Camps, did the Romans use any
other customs besides what you have related?



CHAP. VII.
The safety and health of a Camp is to be regarded, and it is
by no means to be besieged.

Fabr.
I Must tell you again that the Romans in their Encampments, were so constant to
their old method, that to retain that they applyed themselves with incredible di|ligence,
not regarding what pains, or what trouble it required: But two things they
observed with a curiosity more than ordinary; one was to place their Camp in an Air that
was healthful and fresh. And the other was to place it where the Enemy might not easily
besiege them, or cut off their provisions. To avoid the unhealthfulness of the place they
avoided all fenny and boggish places, or where the wind was cold and unwholsom, which
unwholsomness they did not so much compute from the situation of the place, as from the
complexion of the Inhabitants, and when they found them swarthy or blowsy, they never
encamped there. As to the other thing, never to be besieged or streightned by an Enemy:
you must consider the nature of the place both where your Friends are placed; and where
your Enemies; and then to make your conjecture whether you can be besieged or no. It is
necessary therefore a General be very skilful in the situation of the Country, and that he
have those about him who understand it as well as he. Besides this, there is another way
of preventing diseases, and that is by providing that no disorder be used in your Army:
for to keep it sound and in health, the way is that your Army sleep in Tents, That they
be lodged as often as may be under Trees that are shady, (where they may have firring to
dress their meat) that they may not be obliged to march in the heat. So that in the Sum|mer
time you must dislodge them before day, and have a care in the Winter that they march
not in the snow, nor upon the ice, without the convenience of fires. That they want
not necessary cloths, nor be constrained to drink ill water; you must command the Physi|tians
of the Army to have a particular care of those who are sick, for a General will find
himself overlaid, when he is at once to contend with an Enemy and a Disease. But of
all remedies, nothing is so powerful as exercise, and therefore it was a custom
among the Ancients to exercise them continually. Think then of what importance
exercise is, when in the Camp it keeps you sound, and in the Field it makes you
Victorious.



CHAP. VIII.
Directions as to Provisions.

Fabr.
AS to Famine, you must not only have a care that the Enemy cannot cut off your
Provisions; but you must consider from what place you may be supplyed, and
see that what you have already be not imbezled. It is convenient therefore that you have
with you always a months Provision before hand, and then you are to oblige your Neigh|bours
and Friends to furnish you daily with more. You must likewise have a good Maga|zine
for Ammunition, in a strong place, which is to be distributed with great care, giving
every man a reasonable proportion every day, and keep such an eye over it, that want of it
may occasion no disorder: for in matters of War every thing else may be repaired in time,
but hunger the longer it lasts, will the more certainly destroy you. Nor will any Enemy

that can master you with Famine, ever seek to attach you with his Arms; because though
the Victory be not so honourable, it is more easie and secure.
That Army therefore in which Justice is not observed: That Army which squanders and
consumes lavishly as it pleases, cannot so well barricado, or fortifie its Camp, but that
Famine will find the way in; for where Justice is neglected, Victuals is not constantly sup|plyed;
and where Soldiers are lavish and profuse, though they have plenty, it is quickly
consumed: For this cause among the Ancients it was commanded that the Soldiers should
eat what was given them, and at a prefixed time, for no Soldier durst eat but when the
General went to dinner; but every body knows how little this is observed in our days,
and if then the Soldiers might be justly term'd sober and orderly, they may now with as
much justice be said to be licentious and debauched.


Battista.
When you began first to order your Camp, you told us you would not confine
your self to two Battalions, but take four, that you might shew us how a just and com|pleat
Army was to be lodg'd: I desire therefore that you would satisfie me in two things:
One is, when I have either more or less than four Battalions, how I am to dispose of them.
The other is, what number of Soldiers would suffice you, to expect, and engage any Ene|my
whatever.



CHAP. IX.
How to lodge more or less than four Battalions, and what number of men
is sufficient to make head against an Enemy, be he as numerous as
he may.

Fabr.
TO your first demand I answer, that be your Army composed of more or less than
four or six thousand men you may increase or lessen their lodgments as you
please, and in the same manner, you may proceed to less or more in infinitum: Never|theless
when the Romans joyn'd two Consular Armies together, they made two Camps,
and turned the place of the unarmed men one against the other.
To your second demand I reply, That the ordinary Roman Army consisted of about
24000 men, but when by accident they were over-pressed with numbers, they never ex|ceeded
50000, with this number they opposed 200000 Gauls which assaulted them after
their first War with the Carthaginians; with this number they opposed themselves against
Hanibal: and you must observe that the Romans and the Greeks always carried on their
Wars with a few men, fortifying themselves with their good order, and the excellence
of their discipline; whereas the Eastern and Western Nations did all by their multitudes,
but the Western people performed all by their natural fury, and the Eastern by their sub|mission
and obedience to their King. In Greece and in Italy where their natural fury, and
their natural reverence to their King was not so great, it was necessary to apply themselves
to discipline, which was of such efficacy, that it has made a small Army prevail against
the fury and natural obstinacy of a greater. I say therefore that if you would imitate the
Romans and the Greeks, you are not to exceed the number of 50000 men, but rather
to be fewer, because more do but breed confusion, and hinder the order and discipline that
you have learn'd. Pyrrhus used ordinarily to say, that with 15000 men he would go
thorow the world.
But let us pass now to another part of our discipline.



CHAP. X.
Certain Artifices, and Advertisements of War.

Fabritio.
WE have gained a Battel with our Army, and shown most of the accidents
which may happen in it: We have caused it to march, and discoursed
with what impediments it might be incumbered in its march, and at length we have brought
it into its Camp, where it is to take not only a little repose after its travel and fatigues,
but consider and deliberate how it is to finish the War. For in the Camp many things are
transacted, especially there being an Enemy in the Field, and Towns to be suspected, of
which it is good to secure your self, and to reduce such as are in hostility. It is necessary

therefore to come to some demonstrations, and pass these difficulties with the same glory
and honour with which we have proceeded thus far. To descend therefore to particulars,
I say, that if many people or persons have any thing in controversie betwixt them to
your advantage, and their own detriment, (as if they should beat down the walls of their
City, or send several of their Citizens into banishment) you must cajole them in such man|ner
that none of them may think it has any relation to them, to the end that neither of
them relieving one another, they may all of them be oppressed without remedy; or else
you must command all of them what they are to do the same day, that each of them be|lieving
himself particularly commanded, may think rather of obeying than looking out
for a remedy; and by that means your commands be executed without sedition or disorder.
If you suspect the fidelity of a people, and would assure your self of them, and surprize
them unawares, you cannot do better than to communicate some design with them, desire
their assistance, and pretend to some farther enterprize, without the least ombrage or suspi|tion
of them: and by doing so, (not imagining you have any jealousie of him) he will
neglect his own defence, and give you opportunity of effecting your designs.
If you suspect that there is any body in your Army that gives advice of your designs
to the enemy; the best way to make your advantage of his treachery, is, to impart some
things to him which you never intend to do; and to conceal what you intend; to pre|tend
doubts where you are perfectly resolved; and to conceal other things that you have
absolutely determined: by this means you will put the Enemy upon some enterprize (upon
presumption that he knows your designs) in which you may easily circumvent and defeat
him.
If you resolve (as Claudius Nero did) to lessen your Army, and send relief to your friend
so privately that the Enemy should not perceive it; you must not take down your Tents,
nor diminish the number of your Hutts; but keep up your Ensigns and preserve your ranks
intire, with the same fires and guards as before. If any supplies come up suddenly to your
Army, and you would not have your Enemy perceive you are reinforced, you must not aug|ment
the number of your Tents; for nothing is more useful than to keep such accidents
secret. Metellus being in Spain with his Army; one took the confidence to demand of
him what he intended to do the next day: He replyed, That if he thought his shirt knew,
he would burn it. Marcus Croesus being asked by one when he would discamp, answered
him, Are you the only man think you that will not hear the Trumpets?
If you design to understand the secrets of your Enemy, and to know his order and con|dition;
you must do as others have done, send Embassadors to him, with wise and expe|rienced
Soldiers in their Train, who may take their opportunity to view his Army, and
consider his strength and weakness so, as may give occasion to overcome him. Some have
pretended to banish some one of their Confidents, and by that means had information of
his Enemies designs. They are discovered likewise sometimes by the taking of prisoners:
Marius whilst he was at War with the Cimbrians, to feel the fidelity of the Gals, (who at
that time inhabited Lombardy, and were in League with the Romans) sent to them two
sorts of Letters, one open, the other seal'd. In the Letters that were open, he writ that
they should not open those which were sealed till such a time as he directed, before which
time he sent for them again, and finding them open, he found he was to repose no con|fidence
there.



CHAP. XI.
How to rid ones self of an Army that is pressing upon ones heels.

Fabr.
SEveral Generals have been invaded, and not marched their Army immediately
against the Enemy, but made an inroad into his Country, and constrained him to
return to defend it; and this way has many times succeeded, because yours are flesh'd with
victory, and loaden with plunder, whilst the Enemy is terrified, and instead of a hopeful
victory, like to go by the loss: so that they who have used this kind of diversion, have many
times prospered. But this is practicable only to those whose Country is stronger than the
Enemies Country; for if it be otherwise, that diversion is pernicious. If a General be
block'd up in his Camp by the Enemy, he cannot do better than to propose an accord, or
at least a truce with him for some days, for that makes your Enemy the more negligent in
every thing; of which negligence you may take your advantage, and give him the slip. By
this way Silla disintangled himself twice, and cleared himself of his Enemies: by the

same Artifice Asdrubal extricated himself in Spain from the forces of Claudius Nero who
had block'd him up; it would likewise contribute much to the freeing a man from the
power of the Enemy, to do something (besides what has been said already) that may keep
him in suspence. And this is to be done two ways, by assaulting him with part of your
forces, that whilst he is employed upon them, the rest may have time to preserve themselves.
There is another way likewise, and that is by contriving some new thing or other that
may amuse or astonish the Enemy, and render him uncertain which way he is to stear: so Ha|nibal
served Fabius Maximus when he had shut him up on the mountains; for causing little
wisps of brush-wood to be tied to the horns of several Oxen, he set them on fire; and
Fabius not understanding the depth of the stratagem, supposing it worse than it was, kept
upon his guard within his Camp, and suffered him to pass.



CHAP. XII.
How a man may make a Princes Favourite suspected, and divide his Forces.
A General above all things is to endeavour to divide the Enemies Forces, either by ren|dering
his Confidents suspicious; or by giving him occasion to separate his Troops,
and by consequence weaken himself. The first is done by preserving the Estates or Goods
of those he has about him; as in time of War, to spare their Houses, or Possessions; and
returning their Children or Relations safe, and without ransom. You know when Ha|nibal
burned all about Rome, he exempted what belonged to Fabius Maximus. You know
how Coriolanus coming with a strong Army to besiege Rome, preserved the Possessions of
the Nobility. Metellus being at the head of an Army againts Iugurtha, moved it to the
Embassadors which the Enemy sent to him, to deliver up Iugurtha Prisoner, and writing
Letters to them afterwards to the same purpose, he continued his Correspondence till Iu|gurtha
got the alarm, suspected his whole Counsel, and made them away after several
manners.
When Hanibal was fled to Antiochus, the Roman Embassadors practised so cunningly,
that Antiochus grew jealous, and trusted him no farther.
As to the way of dividing the Enemy, there is not any more certain than to cause an in|cursion
to be made upon his Country, that he may be constrained to leave the War, and go
back to defend himself. This was the way which Fabius used when he had an Army against
him of French and Tuscans, Umbrians and Samnites. Titus Didius having a small Army
in respect of the Enemy, expecting another Legion from Rome, which the Enemy was de|sirous
to intercept; he gave out in his Army that the next day he would give the Enemy
Battel, and ordered it so, that certain Prisoners which he had in his Camp at that time, took
their opportunity to escape, and gave intelligence to the Enemy that the Consul had given
orders to fight; upon which news, that they might not lessen their Forces, they did not
march against the other Legion, and by that means it was preserved; some there have
been who to divide or weaken the force of their Enemy, have suffered him to enter into
their Country, and possess himself of several Towns, that by putting Garrisons into them,
he may lessen his Army, and give them occasion to attack and defeat him. Others design|ing
against one Province, have pretended to invade another, and used such industry in the
business, that being entred unexpectedly into that Country, they have conquered it before
the Enemy had time to relieve it: for the Enemy being uncertain whether you will return
back and invade the Country which you threatned before, is constrained to keep his Post,
and not to leave one place to secure another, and it falls out many times that he is unable
to defend either the one or the other.



CHAP. XIII.
In what manner seditions and mutinies in an Army are to be appeased.

Fabr.
BEsides what has been said already, it is of great use and reputation to a General,
if he knows how to compose mutinies and dissentions in his Army. The best
way is by punishing the Ringleaders, but then it is to be done so neatly, that they may
have their reward before they have news that it is intended. The way to do that is, if
they be at any distance, to summon both nocent and innocent together, that they thinking
themselves safe, and not in danger of any punishment, may not be refractory, and stand up|on
their guard, but put themselves quietly into your hands to be punished. If they be
present, and at hand, the General is to make himself as strong as he can with those who
are innocent, and others in whom he can confide, and then punish as he thinks fit. When
the quarrel is private, and among themselves, the best way is to expose them to danger,
and let them fight if they think good; for the fear of that does many times reconcile
them. But above all things, there is nothing that keeps as Army so unanimous as the re|putation
of the General, which proceeds principally from his courage; for it is neither
birth nor authority can do it without that.
The chief thing incumbent upon a General is to pay well, and punish well; for when|ever
the Soldiers want pay, 'tis but reasonable that they should want punishment; for
you cannot in justice chastise any exorbitance in a Soldier, when you disappoint him of
his pay; nor can he forbear stealing, unless he be willing to starve: but if you pay, and
do not punish them, they are insolent again; and you will become despicable in holding
a Command that you are not able to manage, and by not maintaining your dignity and
authority, of necessity tumults and disorders must follow, which will be the utter ruine of
your Army.



CHAP. XIV.
How the Ancients relied much upon their auguries, and other accidents.

Fabr.
THe Generals of old were subject to one molestation, from which in our days we
are exempt: and that is how to pervert an ill augury, and interpret it to their
advantage: for if an Arrow fell down in an Army: if the Sun or the Moon was Eclip|sed:
if there hapned an Earth-quake, or it was the General's fortune to fall down, either
as he got up on horse-back, or dismounted, it was look'd upon by the Soldiers as an ill
omen, and was the occasion of such fear in them, that coming afterwards to a Battel they
were easily beaten: and therefore the Generals in times past when such an accident hap|pened,
immediately gave some reason for it, and referr'd it to some natural cause, or else
wrested and perverted it to their own profit and advantage.


Caesar
passing over into Africa, tumbling down upon the ground as he came out of the
Ship, grasping the grass in his hands, he cryed out, Teneo te O Africa; Africa you are
mine, for I have you in my hands. And several others have given reasons (according to
their own interest) for the Earth-quakes and Eclipses of the Moon: but in our days these
artifices cannot pass, because our men are not now so superstitious, and our Religion ex|plodes
such opinions as heathenish and vain: but whenever we should be so blind as to
reassume those superstitions, we must revive the custom of the Ancients.




CHAP. XV.
That we are not to fight with an Enemy reduced to despair; and several arts
that may be used to surprize him.

Fabr.
WHen famine, natural necessity, or human passion has brought your Enemy to
such despair, that impelled by that, he marches furiously to fight with you, you
must keep within your Camp, and decline fighting as much as possibly you can. The La|cedemonians
acted in that manner against the Messeni; Caesar did the same against Afranius
and Petreius. When Fulvius was Consul against the Cimbrians, he caused his horse to
attack the Enemy for several days together; and observing in what numbers they came
forth to engage them, he placed an ambush one day behind their Camp, caused them again
to be assaulted; and the Cimbrians issuing forth in their old numbers to encounter them;
Fulvius fell in the mean time upon their Camp, entred it, and sack'd it. Some Generals
have made great advantage (when they lye near the Enemies Army) to send out parties
with the Enemies Colours to plunder their own Country; for the Enemy supposing them
supplies sent to relieve them, have issued forth to meet them, and assist them to plunder,
whereby they have been put to disorder, and given opportunity to the adversary to over|throw
them. Alexander of Epirus did the same against the Sclavonians: and Leptene the
Syracusan against the Carthaginians, and both with success: many have been too hard for
their Enemies by giving them opportunity of eating and drinking too much, making a shew
of being afraid, and leaving their Camp full of wine and provisions; with which the Ene|my
having gorg'd himself without measure, the others have fallen upon them with advan|tage,
and put them to the sword. Tomyris provided such an entertainment for Cyrus; and
Tiberius Gracchus regall'd the Spaniards in the same manner: others have poysoned their
meat and their drink, to ruine the Enemy that way the more easily. I said before, that I
did not find it in any History that the Romans did ever in the night place any Centinels
without their Camp, supposing they omitted it to prevent the mischiefs that might ensue;
for it has been often seen that the Centinels which are placed abroad in the day time to hear
and descry the Enemy, have been the destruction of those who have sent them; for being
often times surprized by the Enemy, they have been forced to give the signal with which
they were to call their own men, and they coming immediately according to the sign, have
been all killed, or taken prisoners.
To over-reach and circumvent an Enemy, it is good sometimes to vary your custom,
that the Enemy depending upon it, may be disappointed and ruined. Thus it happened
with a General, who being accustomed to give the signal of the approach of the Enemy in
the night by fire, and in the day time by smoke; commanded that they should make smoke
and fire together without intermission, and that when the Enemy came, they should put
them both out; the Enemy supposing he was not perceived, (because he saw no signal given)
marched on in disorder, and gave his Adversary the victory.
Memnon the Rhodian desiring to draw his Enemy out of his strong hold, sent one by the
way of a fugitive into their Army, with news that Memnon's Army was in a mutiny, and that
the greatest part of them were gone from him; and to confirm it the more, he caused
disorders and tumults to be pretended in his Camp; whereupon the Enemy taking en|couragement,
advanced out of his hold to attack Memnon, but was cut off himself.
Besides the things above-mentioned, great care is to be had never to bring your Enemy
to despair. Caesar was very cautious of this in his War with the Germans, and opened a
way for them, when he saw that not being able to fly, they must of necessity fight, and that
more couragiously than otherwise; wherefore he chose rather the trouble of pursuing
them when they fled, than the danger of fighting them when they were forced to defend
themselves. Lucullus observing a party of his horse going over to the Enemy, caused a
Charge to be founded immediately, and commanded other parties to follow them; where|upon
the Enemy believing Lucullus intended to fight, sent out a party to charge those Ma|cedonians
who were running away; and they did it so effectually, that the Macedonians
were glad to stand upon their guard, by which means of fugitives intended, they became
good Subjects in spight of their teeths.




CHAP. XVI.
How a suspected Town or Country is to be secured, and how the
Peoples hearts are to be gained.

Fabr.
IT is a great thing in a General to know how to secure a Town that you suspect,
either after a Victory or before; as several ancient examples do demonstrate.
Pompey being jealous of the Catinenses, beg'd of them that they would give entertain|ment
to some of his sick men, and under the disguise of sick, sending stout and valiant
men, they surprized the Town, and kept it for Pompey. Publius Valerius was diffident of
the Epidauni, and caused a General indulgence to be given in one of the Churches with|out
the Town, the people thronging thither for pardon, he shut the Gates upon them,
and received none back again but such as he could trust. Alexander the great being to
march into Asia, and by the way secure himself of Thrace; carried along with him all
the principal persons of that Province, giving them commands in his Army, and leaving
the people to be governed by those of their own condition; by which means he satisfied
all parties; the Nobility by paying them, and the Populace, by leaving no Governor that
would oppress them. But among all the ways wherewith the people are to be cajoled,
nothing goes so far as examples of chastity and justice, as that of Scipio in Spain, when
he returned a beautiful young Lady to her Parents, and Husband untouched, a passage
that contributed more than his Arms to the subduction of that Country. Caesar only
for paying for the wood which he caused to be cut down to make Stoccadoes about his
Camp in France, got such a name for his justice, that it facilitated the Conquest of that
Province. I know not now that there remains any thing to say further about these acci|dents;
or that there is any thing which we have not already examined. If there be any
thing, it is the way of taking and defending of Towns, which I am willing to show, were
I sure I should not be tedious.


Battista.
Your civility is so great, that it makes us pursue our desires without the least
fear of presumption; for you have offered us that frankly, which we should have been a|shamed
to have requested. We do assure you therefore you cannot do us a greater favour
than to finish this Discourse; but before you proceed, let me entreat you to resolve me,
whether it be better to continue a VVar all VVinter long (as they do now adays) or carry
it on only in the Summer, and in the VVinter go to their Quarters.



CHAP. XVII.
War is not to be continued in the Winter.

Fabr.
OBserve Gentlemen, had it not been for the prudence of Battista, a very consi|derable
part of our Discourse had been omitted: I tell you again that the An|cients
did every thing with more prudence and discretion than we, who if we be defective
in any thing, are much more in matters of War.
Nothing is more imprudent and dangerous for a General than to begin a War in the
Winter, and he who is the aggressor is more liable to miscarry, than he that is invaded.
The reason is this, all the industry employed in Military Discipline, consists in preparing
your men and putting them into order for a Battel. That is it, at which a General is prin|cipally
to aim, because a Battel does commonly decide the business, whether it be lost or
won. He therefore who knows best how to put his Army in order, and he who knows
best how to prepare and equip them, has doubtless the advantage, and is in most hopes
to overcome. On the other side, nothing is more inconsistent with good order than steep
places, or cold rainy weather; for steep places will not suffer you to open or extend your
ranks according to discipline; cold and wet weather will not permit you to keep your men
together, nor present them in close order before the Enemy, but constrains you of necessity
to lodge them up and down, asunder without order, at the mercy of all the Castles, and
Towns, and Villages that receive you; so that all the pains you have taken to discipline
your Army, is (for that time) utterly useless.
Do not admire, If now adays we make War in the Winter, for our Armies being with|out
discipline, it is not to be imagined what inconveniences they suffer by not being quar|tered

together; for it troubles them not, that they cannot keep those orders, and observe
that discipline which they never had. Yet it ought seriously to be considered what preju|dice
has followed upon encampments in the Winter: and it ought likewise to be remembred
that the French in the year 1503. were broken and ruined near Garigliano, rather by the
extremity of the weather, than the magnanimity of the Spaniards. For as I told you
before, the Invador is under greatest incommodity, as being more exposed to the weather
in an Enemies Country, than at home: for to keep his men together he is necessitated to
endure the cold and the rain; or to avoid it, to divide his men, which is mightily to ex|pose
them. But he who is upon the defensive part can choose his place and his way, attend
him with fresh men, which he can joyn in a moment, and fall upon some party of the
Enemies with such fury, as they will not be able to endure the shock. It was the weather
therefore which disordered the French, and 'tis the weather that will always ruine any man
that begins War in Winter, if his adversary have any share of discretion. He therefore
who would have his force, his order, his discipline, and his courage of no use or advan|tage
to him, let him keep the Field, and carry on his War in the Winter: For the Romans
(who desired all those things in which they employed their industry and diligence should
be useful to them) avoided the incommodities of Winter, as much, as the asperities of the
Alps, the difficulty of places, and whatever else might hinder them from showing their
dexterity and courage. And thus much as to your demand, we will discourse now of ta|king
and defending of Towns, and of their Natural, and Artificial strength.




THE SEVENTH
BOOK.

CHAP. I.
How Towns, or Castles are to be fortified.

Fabr.
YOU must understand that Towns and Castles are strong two ways, by
Nature or by Art. They are strong by Nature which are encompassed by
Rivers or Fens, (as Mantua, and Ferrara) or seated upon some Rock,
or craggy Mountain (as Monaco, and Sanleo) for other places seated upon
Mountains, if not difficult of access, are in our days rather weaker than otherwise, in
respect of our Artillery and Mines: and therefore at present being to build a City, or erect
a Fort that may be strong, we choose to do it in a Plain, and fortifie it artificially with
Ramparts and Bastions, and our first care is to make the Walls crooked and retort, with
several Vaults and places of receipt, that if the Enemy attempts to approach, he may
be opposed and repulsed as well in the flank as the front: If your Walls be made too high,
they are too obnoxious to the Cannon; if they be too low, they are easily scaled; if
you make a Ditch before the VVall, to make the Scalado more difficult, the Enemy fills
it up (which with a great Army is no hard matter) and makes himself Master immediately.
My opinion therefore is this, (but with submission to better judgments) that to provide
against both inconveniencies the best way will be to make your VVall high, and a Ditch on
the inside rather than without; and this is the strongest way that you can build, because it
keeps you both from their Artillery and assaults, and gives the Enemy no capacity of filling
up the Ditch. Your VVall then is to be of the best height you can contrive; three yards
thick at the least to resist their Batteries; it is to have Towers and Bulwarks at the distance
of every 200 yards. The Ditch within is to be thirty yards broad at least, and twelve
in depth; and all the earth which is taken out of the Ditch is to be thrown towards the

Town, against a Wall which is to be brought for that purpose from the bottom of the
Ditch, and carried up a man's height above the ground, which will make the Ditch more
deep and secure. Towards the bottom of the Ditch every two hundred yards, I would
have a Casemat from whence the Artillery may scour, and play upon any body that shall
descend. The great Guns which are used for the defence of a Town, are to be planted
behind the Wall on the inside of the Ditch; for to defend the first wall, Falcons and such
small Pieces are easier managed, and do as good Execution. If the Enemy comes to scale
you, the height of the first Wall defends you easily: If he comes with his Artillery, he
must batter down the first Wall, and when he has done that, it being Natural in all Batte|ries
for the Wall and rubbish to fall outward, there being no Ditch without to swallow
and receive it, the ruines of the Wall will encrease the Depth of the Ditch, in such manner
as that you cannot get forward, being obstructed by the Ruines, hindred by the Ditch, and
interrupted by the Enemies great Guns within the Walls that do great slaughter upon you.
The only remedy in this case is to fill up the Ditch, which is very hard in respect of its di|mensions,
and the danger in coming to it, the Wall being crooked, and Vaulted, and full
of Angles, among which there is no coming without manifest hazard, for the reasons above|said;
and to think to march with Faggots over the ruines, and to fill it up that way is a
chimerical thing; so that I conclude a City so fortified is not to be taken.


Battista.
If one should make a Ditch without, besides that within the Wall, would not
your Town be the stronger?


Fabr.
Yes, without doubt; but my meaning is, if one Ditch only be to be made,
it is better within than without.


Battista.
Would you have Water in your Ditch, or would you rather have it dry?


Fabr.
Opinions are divided in that point; for Ditches with water are more secure against
Mines, and Ditches without are harder to be filled up: But upon consideration of the
whole, I would have them without water, because they are more secure; for it has been
seen, that the freezing of the Ditch in the Winter has been the taking of many a Town,
as it hapned at Mirandola when Pope Iulius besieged it: And to prevent Mines, I would
carry my Ditch so low, that whoever would think to work under it, should come to the
water. Castles I would build (as to my Ditches and Walls) in the same manner, that
they might have as much trouble who stormed them. But let me give one caution to any
man who defends a City, and it is this, that he makes no redoubts without, at any distance
from the Wall, and another to him that builds and fortifies a Castle, and that is, that he
makes no works within for retreats in case the first Wall be taken.
The reason that makes me give this Counsel is, because no man ought to do that which
may lessen his reputation at first; for the dimunition of that makes all his other orders
contemptible, and discourages those who have undertaken his defence. And this that I
say will always happen when you make Bastions without, and oblige your self to defend
them, they will certainly be lost, for such small things being now adays to contend with
the fury of Artillery, 'tis impossible they should hold out, and the loss of them being a
lessening to your reputation, the lessening of your reputation will be the loss of the place.
When Genoa rebelled against Lewis King of France, he caused certain Bastions to be
erected upon the Hills which were about the Walls, which Bastions were no sooner lost
(and they were lost presently) but the City was taken.
As to my second advice, I do affirm that there is nothing so pernicious to a Castle as to
have those works of retreat; for the hopes that men have of preserving themselves by
deserting their Posts, makes them abandon them often, and the loss of their Posts, is
afterwards the loss of the Fort. We have a fresh example of this in the taking of the
Castle at Furli, when the Countess Catharina defended it against Caesar Borgia, the Son of
Alexander VI. who had brought the French Army before it. This Castle was full of those
retreats; for first there was a Citadel, then a Fortress, and betwixt both a good Ditch with
a draw bridge. The Castle within was divided into three parts, and each part strongly
separated from the other with Ditches and Water, and Draw-bridges by which they com|municated.
As soon as the Duke had made his approaches, he with his great Guns bat|tered
one part of the Castle, and laid open a good part of the Wall; whereupon Giovanni
da Casale who had the command of that quarter, never stood to make good the breach, but
left it to retire into another part, so that the Enemy having entred the first quarter with
little difficulty, it was not long before they made themselves Masters of all, by securing the
Draw-bridges (in the hurry) which conveyed them one to another: This Castle therefore
which was thought inexpugnable was lost by two faults; one was for having so many Re|doubts,
the other was because none of them commanded the Bridges; the ill contrivance
therefore of the Fortress, and the imprudence of him that defended it, was a shame

and disappointment of the magnanimous enterprize of the Countess, who had the courage
to expect an Army which neither the King of Naples, nor the Duke of Milan had the
confidence to attend. Yet though she miscarried in her designs, she reaped the honour
which her magnanimity deserved, as appeared by many Epigrams composed in those times
in her praise. If then I were to erect a Fort, I would do it with as strong Walls, and
with as good Ditches as I have prescribed; and within it, I would build only houses for
habitation, and those low and weak, and such as should not hinder the prospect of all the
Walls, from those who were in the Piazza; that the Commander might have the advan|tage
to discern with his eye from the main guard, whither he was to direct his supplies,
and that every man might understand when the Wall and the Ditch was lost, the Castle was
not to be kept. And when I made any redoubts and retrenchments within, I would do it
in such manner that they should each of them command the Bridges which should be rais'd
upon Pillars in the middle of the Ditch.


Battista.
You have said that small places are not to be defended in our days, and I sup|pose
I have heard quite contrary; that is to say, the lesser a place is, the better it is
defensible.


Fabritio.
You were then misinformed, for no place can be now adays strong, where
the defenders have not room for new Ramparts and Retrenchments to retire to; for such
is the fury of the Artillery, that he who presumes upon the protection of one Wall or one
Rampart, will find himself deceived. And because Bastions or Forts (provided they do
not exceed their just measure, for in that case they will be rather Castles and Towns) are
not made in such manner that there is space to retreat, they must presently be lost. It is
wisdom therefore to place these Bastions without, and to fortifie within, especially the
entries into the Towns, and to secure the Gates with Ravelins, so as that no body may
come in or go out in a direct line, and that from the Ravelin to the Gate there may be a
Ditch with a Draw-bridge. The Gates are to be fortified with Portcullisses, to receive
their men back again into the Town when they have gone out to engage the Enemy, and
when it happens that they are repulsed, and the Enemy pursues, that they may distinguish
betwixt their own men and the Enemy, and prevent their entring Pell-mell amongst them.
To this purpose Portcullisses (which the Ancients called Cateratte or Pigion-holes) were
invented, which being let down excluded the Enemy, and preserved their Friends,
whereas without them, neither Bridges nor Gates would be of any use, being possessed
by the multitude.


Battista.
I have seen these Portcullisses of which you speak in Germany; and they were
made of bars of wood in the fashion of Iron Gates, whereas ours are made of massy Raf|ters
or Girders all of a piece, now I would willingly be informed from whence this diffe|rence
proceeded, and which is most effectual.


Fabr.
I tell you again, that the ways, and customs and orders of War are laid aside all
the world over, in respect of what was used among the Ancients, but in Italy they are ut|terly
forgot, and if there be any thing better than other, we have it from the Ultra|montani,
or Northern Nations. You may have heard, and perhaps some of these Gentle|men
may remember how weakly we fortified before the coming of Charles 8. into Italy, in
the year 1494. The battlements of our Walls were made but half a yard thick; the Port-holes
for our great Guns, and Musquets or small Shot were made narrow without, wide
within, with many other defects which I shall forbear to mention, lest I should become
tedious; for those thin battlements were quickly beaten down, and our Guns were as
easily dismounted.
But now adays we have learn'd of the French to make our Battlements large and thick,
and our Port-holes large within, close again in the middle, and wide again without; by
which means our Artillery are not so easily dismounted, nor our Soldiers beaten from their
Works. Besides these the French have several other good ways, which our Soldiers have
not seen, and so have not so much as considered; and among the rest those open Portcullisses
like grates is one, and they are much better than ours, for if to defend and fortifie your
Gate, you have a close Portcullis, when you let it down to keep out the Enemy, you shut
up your selves, and cannot afterwards do him any hurt, so that with Pick-axes, Hatchets,
Petards, or Fire, he may do what he please without any interruption. But if your Portcullis
be made Lettice-wise and transparent, when it is let down thorough the holes and inter|vals
you may defend it with your Pikes, small Shot, or any other kind of Arms.


Battista.
I have observed in Italy another Northern invention, and that is to make the
wheels of your Carriages for your great Guns with spokes crooked or bending towards the
Axel-tree, Now I would gladly know the reason of that way, because to me the straight
spokes seem stronger.



Fabr.
Do not imagine that things which deviate from common use, are done by accident;
or if you fancy they were made in that fashion for beauty, you are mistaken; for where
force and strength is required, they never stand upon beauty; but the reason why they were
changed, was because these kind of spokes are much more secure and strong; and the rea|son
they are stronger is this; when a Carriage is loaden, it is either equally poiz'd, or
hang'd too much on one side. When it is equally poiz'd, the wheels bear equally, and the
weight being equally distributed, does not burthen them much: But when it inclines to
one side, the weight lies all upon one of the wheels: If the spokes be made straight, they
are easily broken, for when ever the wheel bends, the spokes bend with it, as being unable
to keep up the weight, so that when the weight is well poiz'd, or is otherwise but mode|rate,
your straight spokes are strong enough, but when your Carriage goes awry, and en|clines
to one side, they are too weak to support it. On the contrary, the spokes of your
French Carriages that are made bending, are made so with great reason, for when a Car|riage
enclines to one side, the spokes on that side being made bending, will come to be
straight, and will be able to sustain the whole weight better, than when it hangs equal,
and (being crooked) bears but half. But to return to our Towns and our Castles. The
French, besides what we have mentioned, have another way of securing their Gates, and
for the sallying and retiring of their Soldiers during a Siege, than I have yet seen practised
in Italy: and it is this, On the outward point of the Draw-bridge they set up two Pillars,
and upon each of them they fasten a beam in such manner that one half of it hangs over
the Bridge, and the other half without. Then that part which is without the Bridge,
they joyn together with Cross bars like a grate, and to the end of each of the beams that
hang over the Bridge, they fasten a chain: when therefore they would shut up the Bridge,
so as no body should come in from without, they loosen the chains, and let down that part
of it that is made with cross bars, which shuts up the Bridge; when they would open the
Bridge, they draw the chains, and that part comes up again, and it is to be raised gradu|ally,
so as to receive a man on Foot, and no Horse, or a Horseman as they please, and it is
raised or let down with unimaginable dexterity. This way is better than your Portcullisses,
because they can hardly be hindred by the Enemy from being let down, not falling in a
direct line as your Percullisses do, which are easily stop'd by putting any thing under them.
They then who would make a Town strong, are to do it in the same manner as I have pre|scribed.
Moreover they are to prohibit Cultivation or building within a Mile round; all should
be a plain without any Hills, Houses, Banks or Trees to hinder the prospect of the besieged,
or give any shelter to the Enemy in his approaches. And you must know that where the
Ditch is without the Walls, and there are eminencies above the level of the Country, that
Town is but weak; for those eminencies are blinds to the Enemy in their approaches, and
when they are possess'd, they are convenient for their Batteries: But let us pass on and come
into the Town.



CHAP. II.
What order is to be observed by him who shuts himself up in a Town,
with resolution to defend it.

Fabr.
I Will not lose so much time as to shew you how convenient it is (besides what has
been said before) to have your Stores of Ammunition and Victuals, because they
are things that every body knows cannot be wanted, and without them all other Provisions
are vain. Two things then are generally to be observed, you are to secure what you can
possibly to your self, and to prevent the Enemy of any Commodity, especially in your own
Precincts. Wherefore if there be any Straw, or Corn, or Cattle that you cannot carry off
into the Town, you must be sure to destroy it. He who undertakes the defence of a Town
is likewise to observe this order, not to suffer any thing to be done tumultuously and dis|orderly,
and to provide that upon every accident, every man may know what he is to do,
and the way is by causing the Women, Children, old, lame and infirm to keep within
their Houses, and leave the Town to be defended by those who are vigorous and strong,
who being armed as is requisite, are to be distributed into all places, some upon the Walls,
some at the Gates, some in the principal places of the City, to relieve their Companions
upon any distress; another party there should be likewise, not obliged to any particular
place, but always ready to succour where necessity is required; and things being thus ordered,

scarce any Sedition can happen to disorder you. Again, there is one thing I will recom|mend
to your memories, both in the besieging and defending of a Town: And that is,
that there is nothing animates an Enemy so much, or gives him such hopes of carrying a
Town, as when he knows his adversary has not been used to the sight of an Enemy; for
many times fear only without any experiment of their strength, has caused a Town to be
surrendred: He therefore who comes before a City so qualified is to make all the shows and
ostentations of terror that he can; and on the other side, he who is assaulted, is to oppose
men of resolution and courage, and such as are not to be terrified with shows, nor any
thing but force and violence of Arms; for if the first brunt be sustained, the besieged
are encouraged, and the besiegers will have no hopes left but in their reputation and
valour.
The Ancients had several instruments of War with which they defended their Towns,
as Rams, Scorpions, Bows, Slings, Clubs, c. Again, they had several Engines which
they used in their Leaguers, as Rams, Towers of wood, Vineae; They had also their Falx,
their Pluteus, Testudo, and others; instead of which, we now make use of Artillery which
is useful both for him that is besieged, as well as him that besieges. But to return.



CHAP. III.
Advertisements for such as are distressed for Provisions within a Town, and
for such as besiege them, and would reduce them to that necessity.

Fabr.
HE who takes upon him the defence of a Town, is to see such provision made
both of Victuals and Ammunition, that he may be in no danger of losing it,
either by Starving or Storm. As to Starving (as is said before) it is necessary before the
siege be laid, that you furnish your self well with Victuals; but because such provision
cannot be made, but a long siege may exhaust it, you must betake to extraordinary ways,
and look out for friends that may relieve you, especially if you have a River running
thorow the Town. Thus the Romans did when their friends were besieged by Hanibal
in the Castle of Catalino, for not being able to relieve them otherwise, they flung great
quantities of Nuts into the River which were carried down by the stream in despight of the
Enemy, and gave the Garrison very good relief. Some who have been besieged, to make
their Enemy believe that they had plenty of Corn, and render them desperate of carrying
them by starving, have thrown bread over their Walls; or else given Corn to some of their
Cows, and suffered her afterwards to be taken by the Enemy, that when they kill'd her,
they might find Corn in her paunch, and conclude that Corn was as plentiful in the Town
as in the Camp. On the other side, wise Generals have used as much Art and Stratagem
for the reduction of Towns: Fabius permitted the Campani to sow their ground, that
presuming upon it, they might make no other provision, and he came afterwards and
utterly destroyed it.
Dionysius having besieged Rhegium, pretended a Treaty, and whilst things were in
transaction, he provided himself with Victuals with all possible diligence, but when he
had effectually supplyed himself, he brake off the Treaty, block'd them up again, and
constrained them to surrender.
Alexander the great being desirous to reduce Lucadia, he took, plundered, and de|stroyed
all the Castles about it, but gave the Garrisons safe Conduct to Lucadia, by which
Policy he so throng'd them with men, that their numbers quickly distress'd them, and
they were forced to surrender.



CHAP. IV.
Other Advertisements both for the Besiegers and the Besieged.

Fabr.
IN matters of assault, I say, the first thing to be provided against, is the Enemies
first Effort; for by that way the Romans gain'd many a Town, assaulting it sud|denly,
and in all places at once, and this they called Aggredi urbem Corona, or to make a
general assault, as Scipio did when he took new Carthage in Spain. But if the Besieged
can stand the first shock, it gives him such courage, he will hardly be taken afterwards.

And if things should go so far, that a breach should be made, and the enemy enter; yet
the Citizens have their remedy if they will stand to one another: for many Armies have
been repelled and defeated after they have entered a Town. The remedy is this, that the
Inhabitants make good the highest places of the City; and fire upon them from the win|dows
and tops of their houses. But against this the Assailers have made use of two inven|tions,
one was to open the Gates of the City, and give the Inhabitants opportunity to es|cape;
The other is, to make Proclamation, that whoever throws down his Arms, shall
have quarter, and none put to the Sword but such as are taken in Arms; and this artifice
has been the taking of many a Town. Moreover a Town is taken with more ease, when
it is so suddenly attacked, as when an Army keeps at such a distance, as that the Town be|lieves
either you will not at all, or cannot attempt it before they shall have the alarm of
your motion, because it is at present so far off. Wherefore if you can come upon them sud|denly
and secretly, not once in twenty times but you will succeed in your design.
I speak very unwillingly of the occurrences of our times, because it must be done with
reflection upon me and my friends; and if I should discourse of other people, I should not
know what to say. Nevertheless I cannot pass by the example of Caesar Borgia (called
Duke Valentino) who being with his Army at Nocera, under pretence of making an in|road
into the Dutchy of Camerin, turned suddenly upon the State of Urbin, and master'd
it without any trouble in one day, which another man would not have been able to have
effected in a much longer time.



CHAP. V.
A man is not to depend upon the Countenance of the Enemy, but is rather to
suspect what even he sees with his eyes.

Fabr.
THose who are besieged, are to be very careful of the tricks and surprizes of the
Enemy, and therefore they are not to relye upon the countenance that he car|ries,
but are rather to suspect there is some fraud or deceit that will fall heavily upon them,
if they suffer themselves to be deluded.
Domitius Calvinus besieging a Town, made it his custom every day to march round
about the Walls with a good part of his Army; The Garrison fancying by degrees that it
was only for his recreation, began to slacken their Guards, of which Domitius having
notice, fell suddenly upon them, and carried the Town.
Other Generals have had intelligence of relief that was expected in the Town, and
having habited a certain number of their Soldisrs, and disposed them under counter|feit
Ensigns, like those which the besieged expected, they were received into the Gates,
and possessed themselves of the Town. Cimon an Athenian General having a design to
surprize a Town, in the night set fire on a Temple that was without it, and the Inhabi|tants
flocking out to extinguish the fire, they fell into an Ambuscado, and lost their Town.
Others having taken some of the Servants, and such people as came forth for forrage, put
them to the Sword, and disguising their own Soldiers in their Cloths, have entred the
Gates, and made themselves Masters of the Town.



CHAP. VI.
How to disfurnish a Garrison of its men, and to bring
a terror upon a Town.

Fabr.
THe Ancients have (besides these) made use of several Stratagems and Artifi|ces
to unfurnish the Enemies Garrisons of their men: When Scipio was in
Affrica, being desirous to possess himself of some of the Garrisons, which the Carthagi|nians
had in their custody, he made many offers to besiege them, but pretending fear, he
not only drew off on a sudden, but marched away with his Army to a great distance.
Hanibal supposing our apprehension real, to follow him with a greater force, drew out
his Garrisons, which Scipio understanding sent Massinissa to surprize them, and he did it
with success. Pyrrhus making War in Sclavonia; advanced against the chief Town in that
Province, in the defence of which Town, several people having got together; he pretended

to despair of carrying it by force, and turning his Arms against other Towns which were
not visibly so strong, he prospered so well in his design, that the said Town drawing out a
good part of its Garrison in relief to their Neighbours, left it self so weak, as it became a
prey to the Enemy. Many have corrupted and defiled the waters, and turned Rivers out
of their Channels, to make themselves Masters of a Town, and have miscarried when they
have done. It is a way likewise that contributes much to the taking of a Town to affright
them with reports, as of some great Victory that you have obtained, some great supplies
that you have received, and an obstinate resolution if they do not surrender quickly to put
them all to the Sword.



CHAP. VII.
To corrupt a Garrison, and take it by Treachery.

SOme Generals of old have endeavoured to take Towns by treachery, by corrup|ting
some of the Garrison, and they have done it several ways: Some have sent of
their own men as fugitives into the Town, thereby to put them into credit and Authority
with the Enemy, and give them opportunity to betray them. Some by this means have
discovered the strength of the Garrison, and by that discovery have taken the Town. Some
under feigned pretences have stopped up the Gates of a Town from shutting, with a Cart,
or beam, or such kind of thing, and given their party the convenience of entring. Hani|bal
besieging the Town of Tarentum in Calabria, which was defended by the Romans un|der
the Conduct of Levius, corrupted a person in the Garrison called Eoneus, and ordered
him that he should go out a hunting in the night, and pretend he durst not do it in the day
for fear of the Enemy. Eoneus observed his directions, went out and in several nights
together, and the Guards had not the least suspition; at length Hanibal disguizing some
of his men in the habit of Huntsmen, sent them in after him, who killed the Guards, pos|sessed
themselves of the Gates, and let Hanibal into the Town. A Garison is likewise to
be cheated by drilling them a good distance out of Town, and pretending to fly when they
come to charge you. Many (and Hanibal among the rest) have suffered their Camps to
be possessed by the Enemy, that they might have opportunity to clap between with their
Army, and get into the Town. Again, they are sometimes deluded by pretending to
raise the Siege as Formio the Athenian did, who having plundered and harrassed the Coun|try
of Calcidon, received their Embassadors afterwards with propositions of Peace: He
gave them very good words, and sent them back full of security and fair promises, upon
which the poor people presuming too much, Formio fell suddenly upon them, and overcame
them. Those who are shut up in a Town, are to keep a strict eye upon such as they have
any reason to suspect, but they are sometimes to be secured and obliged to you by pre|ferment
as well as by punishment. Marcellus knew that Lucius Baucius the Nolan was a
great favourer of Hanibal, yet he carried himself to him with so much kindness and gene|rosity,
that of an Enemy, he made him his intimate Friend.



CHAP. VIII.
Good Guard is to be kept in all places and times.

Fabr.
THose who are in any fear of being besieged, are to keep diligent guard as well
when the Enemy is at a distance, as at hand: and they are to have most care
of those places where they think themselves most secure; for many Towns have been lost
by being assaulted on that side where they thought themselves impregnable; and this mis|carriage
arises from two causes; either because the place is really strong and believed inac|cessible;
or else because of the policy of the Enemy, who with great clamour and noise pre|tend
to storm it on one side, whilst on the other he does it as vigorously, but with all the
silence imaginable. And therefore it concerns the besieged to be very careful, and keep
good Guards upon the Walls, especially in the night, and that as well with Dogs as with
Men, for if they be fierce and watchful, they will give an alarm (if the Enemy approaches)
as soon as any thing: And not only Dogs, but Birds have been known to have preserved
a Town, as it happen'd to the Romans, when the French besieged the Capitol: when the

Spartans lay before Athens, Alcibiades to discover how his watches were kept, comman|ded
that in the night when ever he held up a light, each of the Guards should hold up
another, and great punishment was to be inflicted upon any that neglected it. Iscrates
killed a Centinal that he found a-sleep, with this expression, I leave him as I found him.



CHAP. IX.
Ways to write privately to ones Friends.

Fabr.
THose who have been besieged have contrived several ways of conveying intel|ligence
to their friends; not daring to trust their affairs to the tongue of a mes|senger,
they write in cyphers many times, and conceal them several ways. The cyphers
are made according to every mans fancy, and the ways of concealing them are divers: some
have writ on the in-side of a scabard of a Sword; others have put their Letters up in Paste,
baked it, and then given it for sustenance to the messenger that is to carry it: some have hid
them in their privities; some in the collar of the messenger's dog.
There is another very useful and ingenious way, and that is by writing an ordinary
Letter about your private affairs, and afterwards betwixt every two lines to write your
intrigues with a certain kind of water that will never be discovered but by dipping it in|to
other water, or by holding it to the fire; and by so doing the Letters will be visible. And
this trick has been very subtilly practised in our times, in which a certain person having a
desire to signifie a secret to some of his friends, and not daring to trust it to a messenger,
he sent out Letters of Excommunication written very formerly, but interlined as above|said,
and caused them to be fixed to the doors of the Churches, which being known to his
friends by some private marks, they understood the whole business: and this is a very good
way, for he who carries it may be deceived, and he that writes it is in no great danger.
There are a thousand other ways invented according to every mans fancy and wit. But
it is much easier to write to those who are block'd up in a Town, than for those who are
besieged to write to their friends abroad, because these Letters cannot be conveyed but by
somebody who must pretend to run away out of the Town, which is a hard and a dan|gerous
thing, if the enemy be any thing careful. But 'tis otherwise with Letters to be sent
into a Town, for a man has a thousand occasions to come into a Leaguer, where he may
watch his opportunity, and slip into the Town.



CHAP. X.
How to repair a breach, and the way to defend it.

Fabr.
BUt let us come now to the present way of beleaguering of Towns: I say, that if
you be assaulted in a Town that is not fortified with ditches on the in-side, (as
I have mentioned before) that your enemy may not enter at the breaches which the Artil|lery
make, (for against other breaches there is no remedy) it is necessary whilst the Artillery
is playing, to cut a new ditch behind the breach of at least thirty yards wide, and to throw
all the earth that comes out of it towards the Town, that it may make a good Rampart,
and add to the depth of the ditch; and this work is to be carried on with such diligence,
that when the wall falls, the ditch may be at least five or six yards deep; and whilst they
are at work to make this ditch, it is necessary that they be secured with two Caseniats, that
may flank the Enemy in case he should endeavour to disturb them: and if the wall be so
strong as to give you time to make your ditch and your casemats; that part which is bat|tered
will be the strongest part about the Town; for that Rampart will be of the same
form and model which we proposed for the ditch within: But where the wall is so weak as
to allow you no time, then you must show your courage, and present yourself bravely at
the breach, your Souldiers well arm'd, and with as much chearfulness as is possible. This
way of throwing up new works was observed by the Pisans when you besieged it, and
they might do it well enough; for their walls were strong, which gave them time, and
the earth good and proper for Ramparts; whereas had they wanted either of those conve|niences,
they must of necessity have been lost. It is wisdom therefore to make these ditches
round about the Town before there be any necessity, as we said before; for in that case
you may expect the enemy without fear.




CHAP. XI.
Of Mines.

Fabr.
THe ancients took several Towns by mining under ground, and that two ways,
either by carrying their mines under ground into the Town, and entring there|by,
(as the Romans did when they took the City of Vejentum) or by undermining only
the walls, and so tumbling them down. At present this latter way is more used than the
other, and renders those Towns which stand high, weaker then the rest, because more
subject to be min'd, and then adding but a good quantity of powder, which takes fire in an
instant, you do not only ruine the wall, but you open the very mountain, and cleave the
works into pieces. The way to prevent this, is to fortifie in a flat Country, and make the
ditch which encompasses your Town so deep, that the enemy may not dig under it with|out
coming to the water, which is the best defence against mines. But if you be to de|fend
a Town upon an eminence, your best way will be to make several deep holes in the
wall, that may give vent to the powder when the enemy sets in on fire.
There is another way likewise to prevent them, and that is by countermining, if you
find where the enemy mines, but 'tis a hard matter to discover them, especially if you be
besieged by a cautious enemy.



CHAP. XII.
Good guards are always to be kept, and your Souldiers not to be divided.

Fabr.
HE who is besieged is to take extraordinary care that he be not surprized in time
of repose, as after a storm; after the Guards are set, (which is either at break
of day, or at the shutting in of the evening) or especially whilst you are at dinner, in which
time many Towns have been taken, and many sallies have been made to the destruction of
the besiegers. Wherefore it is necessary to be upon the Guard in all quarters, and your
men generally arm'd: and here I cannot omit to tell you that nothing makes a Town or
Camp harder to be defended, than the dividing of your forces; for the enemy being able
to attack you when he pleases with all his power at once, you must be ready on all sides,
and having parted your Forces, you will be forced to defend your self with a part, and
to keep the same guards with the remainder when ever the enemy assails you, as you should
have done when your whole Garrison was together; which is a great disadvantage, for
he can attack you with his whole power, when you have but a part of yours to defend
your self.



CHAP. XIII.
That when ones sees himself block'd up on every side, it is good to expose ones
self now and then, and of the advantages which have ensued.

Fabr.
IF he who is besieged be beaten considerately, he is certainly lost; but the Besieger
can only be repulsed: for which reason many who have been besieged (either in
Camp or Town,) though they have been inferior in number, have nevertheless sallied
with their whole force at a time, and been two hard for the enemy. Thus Marcellus did
at Nola; thus Caesar did in France, when his Camp was encompassed with a vast number of
Gauls, for finding he was not able to defend it, because he must divide his men into par|tles,
and distribute them round; and finding also that standing within his stoccado's he
could not do so much execution upon the enemy as he desired, he opened his Camp on
one side, and issuing out of it with his whole force, charged the enemy with such fury
and courage that he put them to the rout. Besides, the obstinacy and resolution of the
besieged does many times astonish and terrifie the enemy. Pompey being encamped against
Caesar, and Caesar's Army in great distress for provisions, Pompey had presented him a piece
of Caesar's bread which was made of herbs, and look'd upon as a very strange thing; Pompey

having viewed it, commanded that it should not be shewn in his Army, lest it should dis|courage
them to consider the obstinacy of their Enemy. Nothing was more honourable
to the Romans in their War with Hanibal than their constancy, because in the greatest of
their distress, and in the worst of their fortune, they never demanded peace, nor disco|vered
any token of fear: on the contrary, when Hanibal was under their Walls, they
sold the ground in which he was encamped, at an higher rate than it would have been
sold at another time: and they were so true and firm in their enterprizes, that they would
not draw off from Capua to defend their own City, though they had an Army before
that, when Hanibal appeared before Rome.
I am sensible that I have told you several things that you understood, and perhaps con|sidered
already; yet I have done it (as I said before) by that means to give you a better
comprehension of the quality of this Army; and to satisfie such (if there be any such
here) as have not had the opportunity to understand it so well as you. I suppose now
there remains nothing but that I give you some general rules which are very obvious and
common.



CHAP. XV.
General Rules to be observed in Military Discipline.

Fabr.
THat which is beneficial to you, is prejudicial to your Enemy, and that which
is beneficial to him, is prejudicial to you.
He who in War is most vigilant to observe the designs and enterprizes of the Enemy,
and takes most pains in exercising and disciplining his Army, shall expose himself to less
danger, and have greater probability of victory.
Never bring your men to fight till you have some just confidence in their courage, till
you have seen them well arm'd, and well ordered; and never let them engage but when
you find them cheerly, and hopeful of success.
It is better to conquer an Enemy by hunger than fighting, in which last victory, for|tune
has more share than virtue or courage.
No resolution is so likely to succeed, as that which is concealed from the Enemy till it
comes to be executed.
Nothing is of more importance in the whole art of War, than to know how to take
advantage when it is offered.
Nature produces few persons strong; but industry and exercise makes many.
Order and discipline is more available in War, than valour or force.
When any come over to your service from the Enemy, they are of great advantage to
you, provided they be faithful; for it is more diminution to the Enemies strength to have
Soldiers revolt, than to have so many slain, though the name of a fugitive is suspicious to
new friends, and abominable to old.
It is better in the drawing up your Battalions for a Battel, to draw them up with re|serves,
and place such behind the front as may supply it upon occasion; than to enlarge
your front, and make as it were but one rank of your whole Army.
He who understands his own Forces and the Enemies too, can hardly miscarry.
The courage of Soldiers is better than their number.
The situation of the place is sometimes more effectual than the courage of your
men.
New and unexpected things are an astonishment to some Armies.
Your Soldiers despise things that are common, and are weary of any thing that is te|dious,
I would advise therefore that by pickeering and little skirmishes you acquaint your
men with your Enemy before you bring them to a Battel.
He who pursues an Enemy that is disordered, in disorder himself; shall lose the victory
he had gained, and perhaps give it to the Enemy.
He who makes not provision of Victuals, will be beaten without a blow.
He who relies more upon his Horse than his Foot, or his Foot than his Horse, must
accommodate himself to the place.
If you would know at any time whether you have any spies in your Army, you have
no more to do but to command every man to his Tent.

If you find the Enemy has any knowledge of your designs, you must change them.
What you are to do, you may advise with many; what you are resolved to do, com|municate
with few.
When Soldiers are in their quarters, they are to be kept in order by fear and by punish|ment;
when in the field, with hopes and reward.
A good General never comes to a Battel but when necessary requires, or some great ad|vantage
invites him.
You must endeavour that your Enemy may not know how you intend to draw up your
Army when you come to fight; and let your figure be what it will, be sure your first Com|panies
be so ordered as that they may fall back into the second, and both into the third.
When you are engaged, never employ any of your Battalia's about any thing but
that to which you deputed them at first; if you would avoid putting things into dis|order.
Sudden accidents are not easily prevented; but those which are foreseen are prevented
without difficulty.
Men, Arms, Money and Provisions are the nerves of War; but the first two are
most necessary, because Men and Arms will find Money and Victuals; but Money and
Victuals can never find Men.
The Rich Man unarm'd, is but a prey to the Soldier.
Use your Soldiers to abominate luxury either in diet or cloths.
This is as much as I can think fit to speak of in general, though I am sensible other things
would have fallen in well enough with my Discourse. As how and in what manner the
ancients ordered their Squadrons; how they were habited, and how they exercised them
in several other things, and I could have added several particulars, which I have not thought
necessary at this time, because you may know it your self, and likewise because it was not
my intention at first to shew you exactly how the ancient Malitia was constituted, but how
it was to be done in our times.
For this reason I have thought unnecessary to speak any farther of those kind of anti|quities,
than what might be serviceable to this introduction. I know likewise I might
have inlarged myself more about the exercising of Horse; and come afterwards to discourse
of Sea-fights, for to distinguish Militia's, their Armies at Sea, and Armies at Land; Ar|mies
of Foot, and Armies of Horse: but of Sea discipline I shall not presume to say
any thing, because I know nothing of it: I shall leave that to be treated of by Genoueses
or Venetians, who by their experience in that kind, have done very great things formerly.
Nor shall I speak any farther of Horse than what I have said before, because they are not
so corrupt and disorderly. For if your Foot (which is the strength of an Army) are
well disciplin'd, and in good order, your Cavalry must be good of necessity.



CHAP. XV.
The way to have many Horse in your Country.

Fabr.
I Would however remember him who is desirous to settle and establish a good Mi|litia
in his Country, that to furnish it handsomly with Horse, he should do two
things; one is, that he should distribute a certain number of good Stalions up and down,
that the Country-men may breed, and drive a Trade with Foles and Colts, as you do in
this Country with Calves and young Mules. The other is, that there might not want
Chapmen for the Colts, I would oblige every man that keeps a Mule, to keep an Horse;
and he that would keep but one thing for his Saddle, should be enjoyned to have it an
Horse; besides, I would constrain every man that wore Cloth-clothes, to keep an Horse
in his Stable.
This order was taken not long since by a Prince of our times, and succeeded so well,
that in a short time he had a most excellent Cavalry. As to other things relating to Hor|ses,
I refer you to what has been said this day, and what has been practised of old.




CHAP. XVI.
A General is to invent of himself, and not follow altogether the
practiecs of his Predecessors.

Fabr.
BUt perhaps you would desire to know what parts and qualifications there ought
to be in a General; and I will satisfie you in short, for I cannot make choice of
a properer man, than he who understands all those things which I have recommended
this day; and yet that would not be sufficient, unless he had abilities to invent some thing
of his own; for never any man was Master of a Trade, who had no invention of his
own; and if invention be honourable in any thing, it is most certainly in this: This is
manifest in all Authors who have constantly applauded all sorts of inventions, how slight
and inconsiderable soever, as appears by the great Character they bestowed on Alexander
the great, for his wisdom in appointing a Cap to be put upon the top of a Launce as a
signal for the dislodging of his Army, rather than to do it by sound of Trumpet as for|merly,
because it imported him much that they should remove privately. He was com|mended
likewise for ordering his Soldiers upon a charge to fall down upon their left knee,
as an expedient that would make them receive the charge with the more strength and
firmness, which invention got him the Victory, and occasioned him so much honour, that
all Statues erected afterwards in his honour, were erected in that posture. But because
it is time to conclude our discourse, I will leave where I began, to avoid the reproach which
is incident to such persons as when once straggled know not how to return.



CHAP. XVII.
The Author returns, and with a short Discourse concludes his Book.

Fabr.
IF you remember (Cosimo) you told me, that you could not imagine the reason
why in one place I should commend Antiquity, and blame those which would
not imitate it in great things; and yet I have not imitated it my self in my Martial affairs,
in which I have taken much pains, and spent a great deal of my time.
To which I answer, That men who are to execute any thing, are first to learn which
way it is to be done, that they may be afterwards the more able, when it comes to opera|tion.
Now whether or no I understand how to establish a Militia according to the method
of the Ancients, I leave you to judge, who have heard me discourse of it so long; from
whence you may imagine how much time has been spent in those thoughts by me; what
great desire I have had to bring them to effect, and whether I have already, or ever may
have occasion to do it. But to satisfie you farther, and justifie my self, I will give you the
reasons, and thereby observe my promise in some measure, by shewing you the convenien|cies
and inconveniencies in such imitations. I say then that no action this day among men
is more easily executed according to the method of the Ancients, than Military discipline;
but it must be among such Princes as are able to bring together 15 or 20000 of their own
Subjects, against an Enemy. On the other side, there is nothing more difficult to such
Princes as have not that convenience: And that you may comprehend it the better, you
must understand that Generals are commended upon two several accounts some are famous
for that with an Army ordered and prepared by their own natural discipline, they have
performed great things; so it was with most of the Roman Citizens, and others who had
the command of Armies; whose only task was to keep their Soldiers good, and Conduct
them securely. Others have been not only to contend with and conquer the Enemy, but
they were first to instruct and exercise their Army; and these doubtless were worthy of
more praise than they who with their old and well experienced Soldiers performed such
Exploits: Of this sort was Pelopidas, Epaminondas, Tullus, Hostilius, Philip of Macedon,
Cyrus King of Persia, and Gracchus the Roman: All those were forced to model and disci|pline
their Armies before they ventured them to sight; and all these were able to do it in
respect of their own experience, and that they had other persons which were able to exer|cise
their Soldiers as they desired. Nor would it ever have been possible that any of those
Generals, how good and excellent soever, could ever have done any great thing in another
Province full of corrupt men, unless it had been accustomed to some honest obedience. It

is not sufficient then in Italy to understand how to manage a Veteran Army; but you must
first know how to make and prepare it, and then how to govern and conduct it. Again,
those who do this, must be such Princes as have great revenues, and many Subjects, in
which number I am not to be reckoned, as one who never commanded, nor never can,
unless it be foreign Forces under some other Prince, into which foreigners, whether it be
possible or not to insuse any of these things of which I have discoursed, I leave you to
judge. How could I perswade a Soldier of our days to carry more Arms than he was
accustomed, and besides his Arms, two or three daies Provision at his back, and a Spade
or Pickaxe at his girdle? How could I prevail with him to work or digg all day; to stand
all day to his Arms in counterfeit exercises, that I might rely the more confidently upon
him when he came to it in good earnest? How could I work upon him to abstain from
play, lasciviousness, blasphemy, and insolence, which is their practice every day? How
long would it be before I could reduce them into such order, such discipline, and awe, that
if an Apple tree was never so full, and stood in the middle of their Camp, none of them
should venture to touch it? as is many times read of the Roman Armies. What is it that
I can promise them that may make them either fear me, or love me, when the War being
ended, I shall have no farther to do with them? How can I make them sensible of shame
who have been born and bread without any? How should they pay me a respect whom they
do not know? By what God, by what Saint shall I conjure them? By the Gods which
they adore, or by the Gods which they blaspheme? Which it is that they adore I cannot
tell, but am sure they blaspheme them all. How can I expect they should keep their pro|mise,
which they do hourly despise? How can they who pay no honour to God, express
any to men? What good discipline then are we like to imprint upon so depraved a Mass?
If you object that the Swizzers and Spaniards are good Soldiers, I confess them much
better than the Italians; but if you consider what I have said, and the manner of proceed|ing
of both those Nations, you will find them come short in many things of the perfection
of the Ancients. The Swizzers are become good Soldiers by natural practice of those
things which I have recommended; and the Spaniards by necessity; for their Wars lying
in Foreign Provinces, where they are constrained either to overcome or dye (because they
can never hope to get off by flying) are grown good, and yet their goodness is in many
things defective; for their excellence is only to stand and receive the Enemy at push of
Pike, and the Swords point; besides, their is not any man among them fit to instruct
another in what is necessary, much less if he be not of their own Country. But to return
to our Italians, who having wanted wise Princes, have not been capable of good orders;
and having wanted that necessity which was incumbent upon the Spaniards, they have not
taken it up of themselves, so that now they are the very scorn and contempt of the world,
not for any fault in the people, but in their Princes, who thereby have been chastised for
their ignorance, and justly punished for losing their Territories so ignominiously, without
any considerable resistance. Will you see that what I say is true? Consider what Wars we
have had in Italy since the Expedition of Charles 8th. to this day: and although othe
Wars rendered Soldiers formidable and martial; these Wars by how much they were more
great, and more furious, by so much both Officers and Soldiers became more dissolute and
cowardly: And this must necessarily proceed from ill orders which are not much better at
this day, and the misery is, there was nor is none able to reform them: Do not think that
there is any way to recover reputation to the Arms of the Italians, but by this way that I
have proposed, and by means of such Princes as have great Territories there; for this form
may be imprinted in men that are simple, and plain, and ones own Subjects, much sooner,
than in such as are lew'd, and disorderly, and strangers. A good Sculptor never expects
to make a good Statue out of a piece of Marble that is mangled and has been ill handled;
but he will do well enough if it has never been touched. Our Princes in Italy before they
were sensible of their Wars with the Northern Nations, believed it was enough for a
Prince to know how to write a civil answer; how to direct a Letter with all its Punctilio's;
how to show himself witty and quick in his reparties; how to juggle, and dissemble; how
to dress himself handsomly, and dispose of his Jewels to the best advantage; how to eat,
and sleep in more state and magnificence than other people; to have a thousand dalliances
and pleasures about him; to behave himself haughtily and extort from his Subjects; to
live in idleness and ease; to dispose of Military commands to their Parasites; to despise those
who proposed any thing of Virtue; to require that their words should be like Oracles, and
of as much authority, as if spoken by God himself; to employ such as had no knowledge
in affairs; to commit great things to those who durst attempt nothing; to believe every
thing immediately without pondering and debating either their words or arguments that
spoke them; and several other imperfections which hindered them from seeing that at last

they must become a prey to any that would attack them. These things in the year 1494.
were the occasion of those flights, and fears, and depredations by which three of the most
potent States in Italy were frequently destroyed. But the worst is, they which remain,
continue in the same errors, and live in the same disorder, without any consideration that
those who formerly desired to preserve their Dominions, did all that I have prescribed this
day; and that their whole study was to accustom themselves both minds and bodies to la|bour,
to trouble, and dispising of danger, And this was the cause that Caesar, and Alexander
and all the valiant and brave Princes were always at the head of their Armies, compleatly
arm'd and on foot, and rather than lose their states they would lose their lives; so as they
lived and dyed with a great deal of honour: And though perhaps some of them might be
condemned for their ambition, and exorbitant desire to Reign; yet they could never be
accused of effeminacy, or doing any thing that might render them delicate and unmanly.
Which passages if they were read and believed by the Princes of our times, it would be im|possible
but they must alter their course of life, and their Provinces their fortune. But be|cause
in the beginning of our discourse you complained of your Militia, I tell you that if
you have ordered it according to my abovesaid direction, and it has not answered your ex|pectation,
you have reason to complain; but if it be not ordered and exercised according
to my rules, the complaint lyes more properly against you, who has made it rather an abor|tion,
than a perfect production. The Venetians, and the Duke of Ferrara began very
well, but they did not persevere, and it was imputable rather to themselves, than their
Soldiers. And let me affirm this to you for a truth, and among all the present Princes of
Italy, he who takes his way first, and observes these rules and these orders, shall make him|self
greater than any Prince in that Country, and it shall happen to his Subjects as to the
Kingdom of Macedon, which falling under the Dominion of King Philip, was improved
to that height by this order and exercise (whilst the rest of Greece were idle, and if em|ployed
at all, it was in following Plays and Balls, and such effeminat entertainments) that
in a few years time he was able to conquer the whole Country, and leave a foundation to
his Son to make himself Monarch of the whole world. He then who despises this Do|ctrine,
if he be a Prince despises his own Principality, and if a Citizen, his own City.
And in this I cannot but complain of Nature, who should either have not suffered me to
have known these things; or have given me power to have executed them, which is a thing
I can never hope for now, as growing old, and towards the end of my days. For this
reason I have discoursed the more frankly with you who are young, and so qualified that
you may be able (if you be satisfied with what is said) to give the same Council to your
own Princes when occasion shall be offered, and I hope with success; and of this I beg you
would not dispond; for this Province seems to have a peculiar faculty of reviving things
that are dead, as it has done Poetry, and Painting, and Sculpture, though for my own
part I cannot expect to see it, as having one foot already in the grave. Certainly had for|tune
indulged me in my young days, so far as to have afforded so much Territory as such an
enterprise required, I believe in a short time I would have demonstrated to the world the
power and efficacy of the orders of the Ancients, by means of which I should have en|larged
my Dominions with honour, or lost them without shame.





THE
MARRIAGE
OF
BELPHEGOR.
BY
Nicholas Machiavel.
IT is recorded in the ancient Chronicles of Florence, that a certain holy Person, whose
life was the admiration of that age, falling one day into a Trance, had a very strange
apparition: it seemed to him, that the souls of married men that came trooping in
great numbers to Hell, cried out all of them as they passed, that their Marriage was
the cause of their misery, and their Wives the occasion of their coming thither: Minos
Radamanth, and the whole infernal Privy-Council were amazed at the clamour; at first
they could not believe there was any thing in the business, but at last observing the same
complaints continually multiplyed, they thought it fit to make Pluto acquainted: Pluto un|derstanding
the report, without imparting any thing to his wife, (who had taken Physick
that week, and kept her Chamber) resolved the matter should be accurately examined,
and such course be taken, as was likeliest to make the speediest discovery of the truth: he
issued out his Writs immediately, and assembled his Courts; his Princes, Dukes, Counts
and Barons were all present; never was Senate so full, nor never was affair of that impor|tance
before it: the holy Father that beheld all, affirms positively, that Pluto delivered
himself in this manner.
Right Trusty and well-Beloved,
Though our Kingdom was assigned us from Heaven, and the fatal decree has anciently de|termined
our Dominion: though that sentence be irrevocable, and above the cognisance of any
humane Power; yet seeing his prudence is most safe, that is dictated by Laws; and his judg|ment
most solid, that is fortified with others; we are resolved to take your counsels along with
us, which way we are to steer in an affair, that otherwise may prove (in time) of great dishonour
to our Government. The souls of married men, that are continually flocking into our Domi|nions,
do unanimously exclaim against their Wives, as the only persons that send them tumbling
hither; to us it seems impossible: yet forasmuch as a peremptory and determinate sentence up|on
their bare allegations, would not suite with our Satanical mercy; so a careless pretermission
on the other side could not be without reflexion on our Iustice: that matters of such impor|tance
therefore may have their due disquisition, and our administration be defended from obloquy
or scandal, that no inconveniency may follow for want of deliberation, and that some better expe|dient
may be found out, than ourselves have happily thought on, we have thought good to call you
together, being confident, and assured by the assistance of your counsels, the honour and reputa|tion
of our Empire will be continued as unquestionable for the future, as it has been preserved
hitherto, by our own proper care and solicitude.
There was not one present, but acknowledged it a business of importance, and well
worthy an exact consideration: it was the opinion of the whole Board, that all imaginable
means as p be used to find out the truth, but what means that was, could not be agreed
on; some were of opinion, a single person was to be dispatch'd into this World, and no
more; others judged it better to send several, and that the discovery would be more cer|tain
from the experience of many, than of one; a third sort, more brisk and severe in
their counsels, thought that clutter unnecessary, and that clapping good store of them to|gether
upon the rack, would be enough doubtless to extort a confession. However it was
at last carried by the plurality of voices, that a single person only should be sent, and in

this resolution the whole company acquiesced, nevertheless there being no body found
that would voluntarily undertake the employment, it was concluded the election should be
by lot; and that the same time, having made their billets, and shuffled them, the lot fell up|on
Belphegor.
One may say, and say true, that fortune never decided any thing so justly; for Belphegor
was no ordinary Devil; and Pluto having made him formerly Generalissimo of his Armies
'tis to be presumed he was no novice; for all this he had a months mind to be quit of his
embassy; but the order being unalterable, he was forced to submit, and accept these con|ditions
that were solemnly decreed, That an hundred thousand Ducats should be paid him
immediately, to defray the expences of his journey; that he should assume the shape of a man;
that he should take a woman to his wedded Wife, and live with her (if possible) ten years;
that at the end of the term, (pretending to die) he should give her the slip, repair immediately
to his old quarters, and make affidavit upon his own experience of all the pleasures and cala|mities
of Matrimony. It was declared to him also, that during this metamorphosis, he was to
be subiect to the pains and misfortunes of humanity, as sickness, imprisonment, and poverty:
but that if by his cunning or dexterity he could disintangle himself, it should be allowed him
and not imputed as any scandal or reproach, Belphegor accepts the conditions, receives his
Ducats, and having drawn a spruce party of horse out of his Guards, and furnished himself
with Pages and Footmen good store, he set out immediately for this World, and arrived
at Florence in a very fair equipage: he chose that place above all other, for the conveniency
of improving his monies, and putting it to interest with greater advantage. He called
himself Don Roderick of Castile; he took a very noble House in the Fauxburg of All-Saints;
and that his quality might be undiscovered, he gave out that he was a Spaniard,
that being young he took a Voyage into Syria, that he had dwelt some time in Aleppo,
where he had got most part of his Estate: but being weary there, he was come into Italy,
as a Country more agreeable with his humour, with intention (if any fair opportunity was
offered) to marry: Don Roderick seemed to be a very handsome man, about thirty years
of age; and in short time after his arrival, he made it evident enough that he was rich,
and by his liberality, that he knew how to make the best use of them; insomuch as several
Gentlemen of Florence, that had more Daughters than money; took all possible pains to in|sinuate
how welcome he should be into their alliance. Don Roderick, that had choice of
Mistresses, preferr'd one that was transcendently handsome before them all, the story says,
she was called Honesta, and was the Daughter of Americ Donati, who had three more also
to marry, and three Sons between twenty or twenty five years of age: but though Seigneur
Americ was of one of the noblest Families of Florence, yet he was look'd upon as down
the wind, and one that was overlaid with too many childeren, and the unavoidable charges
of his Nobility: but Don Roderick took an order for that, defraying the whole expence of
his Wedding; out of his own purse managing all things with that splendor and magni|ficence,
that there was nothing omitted that was desirable upon such an occasion. It was
mentioned before, as one of the conditions proposed to Belphegor, that as soon as he was
out of the Infernal dominions, he should be subject to all the passions of mankind; and
accordingly he began immediately to take delight in the honours and gallantry of the
World; and as cunning a Devil as he was, to be wheedled with the flatteries and ap|plauses
of men: but that which delighted him so much, cost him dear; besides that he
had not been long with Honesta, but he fell stark mad in love with her, and finding some|thing
or other extraordinary in her, that I cannot think of, he was so far inamoured, he ne|ver
thought himself happy before; insomuch as when she was melancholy, or out of hu|mour,
he would curse his Commission, and take his corporal Oath his very life was tedious.
On the other side it was not to be forgot, that Honesta marrying Roderick, and bringing him
Beauty and Nobility instead of a Portion, she thought it not fit to leave her pride and un|tractableness
behind her; these two good qualities were so eminently in her, that Roderick
who had been used to Lucifers, and had more than once had experience of it, swore point-blank
his Wives insolence was beyond it: for when she once found the fondness and pas|sion
her Husband had for her, believing she could manage him with a switch, and order
him as she pleased, she carried her self like his Soveraign, and handled him without pity or
respect; and if it happened he denied her any thing, she gave him immediately to under|stand,
that she was also as loquent in scoulding, as others of her quality. By this you may
Judge what a cooler this was to Don Roderick: nevertheless the consideration of his Father-in-Law,
his Wives Brothers, the Kindred he had by that blessed Marriage, but above all
the passion and tenderness he had for her, made him endure all patiently. I shall not men|tion
the expence of his clothes, which though never so rich, he was forced to change every
week, according to the ordinary vanity of the Ladies in Florence. Besides these, there

were other things were of no less inconvenience; he was forced (to preserve the peace)
to assist his Father-in-Law in the Marriage of his other Daughters, which cost him a good
round sum: moreover that all things might go well, and his correspondency continue with
his Consort, he was glad to send one of her Brothers into the Levant with woollen Stuffs,
another into France and Spain with Silks, and to furnish the third with wherewithal to set
up a Goldsmith's-shop in Florence: all which afflictions together were sufficient to dis|compose
any Devil of a thousand, yet he had other thrown into the bargain: there is not
any Town in all Italy more extravagant in their expences, in their Carnivals and Feasts of
St. Iohn, than Florence; and Honesta upon that occasion must needs have her Roderick out-do
all people of his Rank, in the sumptuousness of his Entertainments, in the magnificence
of his Balls, and other divertisements that are usual at those times: he suffered all these ca|lamities
for the same reasons he endured the rest; and though perhaps these difficulties
were very hard and unpleasant, he would have thought them supportable, could he have
been satisfied, his patience would have procured any quietness in his Family, and that he
might have peaceably attended the hour of his destruction. But Don Roderick found the
clear contrary; besides the expence your have heard she occasioned, her insolence was accom|panied
with a thousand other, inconveniencies, insomuch as he could keep neither officer
nor servant in his house above three days together. This was severe trouble to him to
find it was impossible for him to keep any body about him, though never so well experi|enced
or affected to his affairs: nor indeed could any body blame them for taking their
leaves, when the Devils themselves that he brought along with him, did chose rather to
return, and toast the bottoms of their feet against the fire of Hell, than live in this World
under the dominion of so super-devillish a woman. Roderick's life being thus miserably
uncomfortable, and his stock that he had reserved, exhausted by her extravagant expences,
he was reduced to that pass, he subsisted only upon the hopes of the advantage he should
make by the return of some Vessels he had sent into the East and West. And whereas be|fore
he had very good credit in that Town, to continue it, and keep up his Port, he borrowed
mony of such as are used in that place to put it out; but those kind of people being such,
as are not usually sleepy or negligent in their affairs, they took notice immediately he was
not over-punctual to his day: his purse being already empty, and he reduced to the highest
extremity, at one dash he receives news of two as disasterous accidents as could possibly be|fall
him. The first was, that one of Honestas Brothers had lost at Hazzard all that Roderick
had intrusted in his hands; and the other was no more welcom, which was, that his
other Brother-in-Law returning into Italy, was himself cast away, and all his goods. The
business was no sooner known in Florence, but his Creditors had a meeting, where giving
him over for one that was irrecoverably lost, and not daring to discover themselves, be|cause
the time of payment was not yet come, they concluded he was to be watch'd very
close, least he should chouse them, and shew them a light pair of heels. Don Roderick of
Castile on the other side, considering with himself his affairs were past remedy, and also the
term he was obliged to by the infernal Law, resolves to take horse and be gone without
more ado, which he performed without much difficulty, living conveniently for that by the
Port del Prato: yet he was no sooner march'd off, but his alarm was taken by his Credi|tors;
they repair immediately to the Magistrates, and pursue him not only with Post and
Officers, but lest a certain number of Ducats should debauch that kind of Cattle, who are
no better in Italy than other places, and prevail with them for an abatement of their speed,
they follow him themselves in a full body, with impatience of hearing some tidings of him.
Roderick in the mean time was no fool, but considered very well what he had to do; as
soon as he was gallop'd about half a league from the Town, he leaves the high-way, and
his horse with it, (the Country being inclosed, and full of ditches on both sides) and was
forced to make the rest of his journey on foot, which he did very succesfully; for wandring
up and down under the shelter of the Vines and Reeds that abound much in those parts, he
arrived at last at Peretola, at the house of Iean Matteo del Bricca, Baily to Iean del
Bene.
By very good fortune he meets Matteo carrying fodder to his Cattle; he accosts him im|mediately,
and promises him as he was a Gentleman, that if he would deliver him from
the Catchpoles that were in pursuit of him, with design to clap him up, and starve him in
Prison, he had an invention in his pate would make him rich out of hand, and of this he
would give such evidence before he departed, as should assure him of his truth and fidelity;
and if I do not, says he, with a damn'd imprecation, I will be content to be delivered up
into their clutches that persecute me. Now you must understand, that though Matteo was
an Hinde and a Peasant, yet the fellow had cunning enough, and knew on which side his
bread was buttered; he considered, if he undertook him, and miscarried, he had nothing

to lose; and that if he succeeded, he should be made for ever; without any more ado
therefore he promises him protection, and clapping him close upon a dunghill that was
before the gate, he covered him over with brush-faggots and reeds, and such other fewel as
lay there in readiness for the fire: and indeed he was no sooner in his retirements, but in
came the Creditors with full cry; they swaggered and laid about them like Lords, but all
to no purpose, Matteo could not be persuaded to confess so much as that he saw him; inso|much
as marching on still in the pursuit, but with as little success as they came thither, they
gave Roderick and their Money over for lost, and returned to Florence every jot as wise as
they were before: The Coast being clear in this manner, and the alarm over, Matteo steals
to the closet where he had left Roderick, gives him a little fresh air, and conjures him to
be as good as his word: Roderick was very honest in that point, and I dare say never any
Devil, as to matters of gratitude, had more of a Gentleman; he gave him thanks for the
great obligation he had received: he swore over and over again, he would do what ever lay
in his power to discharge himself of his promise, and in the heat and height of his com|pliments,
to convince him that he meant as he said, he gives him the whole story as you
have had it, and at last told him the very way that he had pitch'd upon to make him a
Prince: know then, sayes he, that whenever you hear of any Lady that is possess'd, 'tis no
other Devil but I that have possess'd her; and be sure I will never leave her, till you come
your self and force me from my quarters, after which you have with enough to make your
own terms for your payment. They had very few words more, he only gave him the Sum|merset
once or twice, and shewed him two or three jugling tricks, and vanish'd.
A while after there was a great noise about the Town, that Mes. Ambrosio Amidei's
Daughter, that was Married to Bonaculo Thebalducci's Son, was possess'd; her Father and
Mother did not fail to use all the remedies are usual in so deplorable a case; they brought
before her St. Zanobes Head, and St. I. Galbert's Cloak, which was nuts to Belphegor, and
made him nothing but laugh: There was no body in her but Don Roderick de Castile, who
was as ingenious a Gentleman-devil as one would wish, and that the world might take no|tice
that this was no fantastick imagination, nor fit of the Night-mare, nor any such trifle,
but that she was really possessed, she spake Latin better than Tully ever Writ, disputed in
Philosophy, and discovered the secrets and sins of several people that were there, who were
very much surprized to find the Devil concern himself with those kind of affairs.
Amongst the rest there was one holy Father he did a great discourtesie to, in blurting out
before the whole company, as if he had kept a young Lass four years together in his Cell, in
the habit of a young Monk; and after all this, let any body judge whether the profession
was not like to be true; Ambrosio in the mean time was in great affliction for his Daughter;
he had tryed all the ways that Physick or Religion could propose, but to no purpose; so as
he was brought to the highest point of despair, when Matteo came to him, and undertook
the cure of his Daughter, if he would give him five hundred Florins, which he designed
to lay out in Land at Peretola: In short, Matteo was an honest fellow, and would have
done the miracle gratis, and like a Gentleman, but his pockets were hollow, and he had
great occasion for Money at that time; Seignior Ambrosio accepts the conditions, and Mat|teo
falls to work; he began very civilly with certain Masses and other Ceremonies, that he
might appear the more formal in the business; at length he stole to the Ladies ear, calls
Roderick, and tells him he was come thither to him, and did require him to be as good as
his word. Content says Roderick, and that you may see I shall deal with you like a person
of quality, take notice, that because this expedition is not enough to inrich you, and do
your business, I will befriend you more than once, for which reason as soon as I am depar|ted
from hence, away I'le march into the Daughter of Charles the King of Naples, and
don't fear but I'le stick to her, till you come to exorcise me, so as there you may make up
your markets at a blow, and become considerable for ever, but be sure after that I be trou|bled
with you no more; and as soon as he had said so, whip says he out of the Lady, and
was gone to the great joy and astonishment of whole Town.
Belphegor in the mean time was as good as his word, as he promised Matteo; away he
goes, and in two or three days time it was all over Italy, that the Daughter of Charles
King of Naples, was in the same condition; which was good news for Matteo, who was
at this bout to gain the Philosophers-stone: In short, he tryed all means possible; the
Monks went to work with their prayers, and their crosses, but to no purpose; The Devil
would not budge till Matteo came himself, who had formerly obliged him. The King had
news of what had happened at Florence, and sends away immediately for Matteo to his
Court, who came accordingly, and after some few ceremonious formalities, counterfeited
for concealment of the mystery, he cures his Daughter. However Roderick before his
departure, as is reported in the Chronicle, accosted him in this manner. You see, Matteo,

I have been as good as my word; you see you are become rich in a trice, and may take your case for the
future; so as if I be not mistaken, I have discharged my self as to you very honestly, hereafter have a care
how you come near me; for as hitherto I have done you knights-service, henceforward I will do you as
much mischief as I can. Matteo being returned to Flrence very wealthy, (for the King of Naples had
given him above five thousand Ducats) he thought of nothing now but enjoying that peaceably he had got,
never imagining Roderick would do him any harm; but his designs were much frustrated by a report out
of France, that Lewis the seventh's Daughter was possess'd as the former: Matteo was in great trouble, on
the one side he was not ignorant of the power of that Prince, on the other he remembred Roderick's last
words; the King used all means possible, but without any success, he was told what feats Matteo had done,
and dispatched a Post to him immediately, to desire his Company at Paris; but Matteo pretending I know
not what indispositions, that rendered him incapable of serving his Majesty, the King was forced to write
to the Magistrates, who sent away Matteo immediately.
Being arrived at Paris, he was in great affliction, because he knew not which way for his life to per|form
what was expected from him. At last he goes to the King, and tells him, that true it was indeed, he
had formerly wrought some cures in that kind, but that it was not in reason to be expected he could dis|possess
all people he met with, seeing there were some Devils so refractory and cross-grain'd, neither
threats nor enchantments, nor devotion it self would do no good on: That he said not this out of any
repugnancy or unwillingness to do as he was desired, but that in case his endeavours were ineffectual, he
might have his Majesties pardon. The King was stark mad at the story, and told him in plain terms, if
if he did not rout the Devil out of his Daughter, as he had done out of others, he would hang him forth|with;
for he saw no reason why Miracles were not as seasible at Paris, as at Florence and Naples: These
words toucht Matteo to the quick, he thought there was no pleasure to be taken in being hang'd in that
manner, and that what the King had said, was without any equivocation: However he recollected himself
a little, or at least pretended so, and calling for the Princess that was possess'd, he makes his approaches, and
whispering her in the ear, told Roderick he was his very humble servant, and put him in mind of the good
office he had done him, when he delivered him out of the talons of the Law; adding withall, that if he left
him in the lurch, in the extremity of danger he was then in, the whole World would cry out on his ingrati|tude;
Roderick heard him with no more patience than needs must, he swaggers, swears, storms, and lays
about like a Devil in good earnest, gives him a thousand and a thousand ill words, but they could distin|guish
only these few at the last: How now, you Rascally Traitor, have you the impudence to come near
me again? have you forgot it was I that made you your fortune? but I'le make all the World see, and
you too, with a pox to you, that I can take away as well as give; besides which, you shall not fail 
hang'd before you get away from Paris: Poor Matteo seeing no other remedy for his misfortunes, he
a thinking of some other way, and having sent back the Lady to her Chamber, he made this speech to the
King. Sir, I have told you before, that their are certain ill-natur'd capricious Spirits, one knows not which
way to deal withal, and of this sort is that which possesses your Daughter; if what we shall administer
might be sufficient, your Majesty should be happy in your desires, and mine also; but if things prove other|wise,
and your Majesty be not satisfied with my endeavours, I shall submit, and your Majesty may deal
with me as I deserve: in the mean time, I desire your Majesty would give order a Theatre be erected in
the Church-yard of Nostre Dame, big enough to receive all the Nobility and Clergy in the Town: Let
this Theatre, if your Majesty think good, be hung with Cloath of Gold, and other rich Stuffs, and an Altar
set up in the middle on Sunday next; I would desire your Majesty to be there, with all the Princes and
Nobility in Paris, and after a grand Mass is sung, let the Princess be brought also: Besides this, it is ne|cessary
there should be twenty persons at least, with Trumpets, Horns, Drums, Hoboys and Symbals, ready
in some by-place, when I throw up my Cap into the air, to advance towards the Theatre with all the noise
they can make; which Musick, with some other ingredients that I have, will I hope send the Devil pack|ing
from the Princess: the King gave order all things should be done as Matteo requested; and Sunday
being come, and the Theatre throng'd with a multitude of persons of quality, and the Church-yard of Nostre
Dame full of people, the Princess was led in by two Bishops, and followed by several Lords of the Court;
Roderick was in a terrible amaze, to behold so magnificent a preparation, and pondering with himself, was
over-heard to pronounce these words: I would fain know what this rascally Peasant means to do; I have seen
many places, I have more than once seen the whole pomp of Heaven, nor am I ignorant of what is most
formidable in Hell, yet can I not tell what to make of this but I'le handle him like a Rogue, as he is, and
if I fall, Pluto requite me; Matteo came up close to him, and desired him very civilly to depart; but Rode|rick
cryed out, Oh the wonderous cunning that is in you! do you think by this whimsey to save yourself
from my power, and the indignation of the King? but think what you will, you scoundrel, I am resolved
you shall hang for't, or else let me pass for the most miserable poor-spirited Devil in the World; Matteo
persisted in his request, but Belphegor gave him worse Language than before; but all that frighted not
Matteo, for without losing more time, he threw his hat up into the air, and at an instant the Trumpets,
Horns, and all the rest of the Musick struck up, and advanced towards the Theatre; Roderick was startled
at the noise, and made it manifest that there are some Devils as fearful as men, and not able to imagine
the reason, he called out to Matteo, and asked what was the matter? Matteo being a cunning Rogue every
inch of him, as if he had been terribly frighted, informs him thus: Alas! poor Roderick, says he, 'tis
your Wife Honesta is come to seek you at Paris; he said no more, but it is not to be imagined what disorder
these four or five words put the Devil into; they took away his wit and judgment, so as without any
consideration, whether the news was possible or not, without speaking one word, away he stole from the Prin|cess;
choosing rather to go back into Hell, and give up his accounts there, than to return again into the
thraldom of Matrimony, that had already cost him so many sorrows and dangers. As soon as he arrived,
he demanded audience, and in the presence of Pluto, Aeacus, Minos, and Radamanthus, all of them
Counsellors of State, he declared that the Souls of Men were in the right on't, and that 'twas their Wives
that sent them to Hell, Matteo that had been too crafty for the Devil, returns to Florence in great triumph;
the Chronicle mentions not any great matter the King gave him, but it says, that having gained sufficiently
by the two former, he esteemed himself very happy that he had escaped hanging at Paris.
FINIS.
