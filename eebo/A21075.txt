_I Haue (for

forth these Infants in|to

the Father would haue

left them lapt vp
in loose Sheets, as soon
as his Fancy was deli|uered
of them; written
especially for his pri|uate
Recreation, to
passe away the time in
the Country, and by
the forcible request of
Friends drawne from
him; Yet passing se|uerally
from hand to
hand in written Co|pies,
grew at length
to be a prety number

among so many sun|dry

some very im|perfect

When, per|ceiuing

Micro-cosmographic.
OR,
A piece of the World
Characteriz'd.

1. A Childe.
_IS a Man in a
small Letter,
yet the best
Copie of A|dam
before
hee tasted of Eue, or the
Apple; and hee is happy
whose small practice in the
World can only write this

Character. Hee is nature
fresh picture newly drawne
in Oyle, which time, and
much handling, dimmes
and defaces. His Soule is
yet a white paper vnscrib|led
with obseruations of
the world, wherewith at
length it becomes a blurr'd
Note-booke. He is purely
happy, because he knowes
no euill, nor hath made
meanes by sinne to be ac|quainted
with misery. Hee
arriues not at the mischiefe
of being wise, nor endures
euils to come by fore seeing
them. He kisses and loues
all, and when the smart of
the rod is past, smiles on his
beater. Nature and his Pa|rents

alike dandle him,
nd tice him on with a bait
of sugar, to a draught of
worme-wood. Hee playes
et, like a young Prentice
he first day, and is not
ome to his taske of me|lancholly.
His hardest la|bour
is his tongue, as if he
were loath to vse so deceit|full
an Organ; and hee
s best company with it
when he can but prattle.
Wee laugh at his foolish
ports, but his game is our
arnest: and his drums,
attles and hobby-horses,
ut the Emblems,  mock|ng
of mans businesse. His
ther hath writ him as his
wne little story, wherein

hee reades those day e
his life that hee cannot member;
and sighes to 
what innocence he has 
liu'd. The elder he growe
hee is a stayer lower fro
God; and like his first fther
mnch worse in 
eeches. He is the Chrstians
example, and the omans
relapse: The omitates
his purenesse, an
the other fals into his siplicitie.
Could he put 
his body with his litt
Coate, he had got eternit
without a burthen, and 
chang'd but one Heaue
for another.



2. A young rawe.
Preacher.
S a Bird not yet fledg'd,
 that hath hopt out of his
est to bee Chirping on a
edge, and will bee strag|ng
abroad at what perill
 euer. His backwardnesse
 the Vniuersitie hath set
im thus forward; for had
e not truanted there, hee
ad not beene so hastie a
iuine. His small standing
nd time hath made him a
roficient onely in bold|esse,
out of which and his
able-booke he is furnisht
or a Preacher. His Col|ections
of Studie are the
otes of Sermons, which

taken vp at S. Maries, 
vtters in the Country. A 
if he write Brachigraphy 
his stocke is so much th
better. His writing is mor
then his reading; for he
reads onely what hee get
without booke. Thus ac+complisht
he comes dow
to his friends, and his fir
salutation is grace  peac
out of the Pulpit. His pray+er
is conceited, and no ma
remembers his Colledg
more at large. The pace o
his Sermon is a ful career
and he runnes wildly 
hill and dale till the clock
stop him. The labour of i
is chiefly in his lungs. An
the onely thing hee ha

made of it himselfe, is the
faces. He takes on against
the Pope without mercy,
and ha's a iest still in lauen|der
for Bellarmine. His acti|on
is all passion, and his
speech interiections: Hee
ha's an excellent faculty in
bemoaning the people, and
spits with a very good
grace. Hee will not draw
his handkercher out of his
place, nor blow his nose
without discretion. His
commendation is, that hee
neuer looks vpon booke,
and indeed, he was neuer
vs'd to it. Hee preaches
but once a yeare, though
twice on Sunday: for the
stuffe is still the same, only

dressing a little alter'd. H
has more trickes with an
Sermon, then a Tailer with
an old Cloake, to turn
it, and piece it, and at las
quite disguise it with a new
Preface. If he haue wade
further in his profession
and would shew Reading
of his own, his Authors a
Postils, and his Schoole
diuinitie a Caechisme. Hi
fashion and demure Habit
gets him in with som
Town-precisian, and mak
him a Guest on Fryda
nights. You shall know
him by his narrow Velue
cape, and Serge facing, an
his ruffe, next his Haire, th
shortest thing about hi

The co~panion of his walke
is some zealous tradesman,
whom he astonisheth with
strange points, which they
both vnderstand alike. His
friends and much paine|fulnesse
may preferre him
to thirtie pounds a yeare,
and this means, to a Cham|ber-maide:
with whom
wee leaue him now in the
bonds of Wedlocke. Next
Sunday you shal haue him
againe.


3. A Graue Diuine.
IS one that knowes the
burden of his calling, and

hath studied to make his
shoulders sufficient: for
which he hath not beene
hasty to launch forth of
his port the Vniuersity,
hut expected the ballast of
learning, and the winde of
opportunity. Diuinity is
not the beginning but the
end of his studies, to which
hee takes the ordinary
stayre, and makes the Arts
his way. He counts it not
profanenesse to bee polisht
with humane reading, or
to smooth his way by Ari|stotle
to schoole-diuinity.
He ha's sounded both Re|ligions
and anchord in the
best, and is a Protestant
out of iudgement, not fa|ction,

not because his
Country, but his Reason is
on this side. The ministry is
his choyce, not refuge,
and yet the Pulpit not his
itch, but feare. His dis|course
there is substance,
not all Rhetorique, and he
vtters more things then
words. His speech is not
help't with enforc'd acti|on,
but the matter acts it
selfe. Hee shoots all his
meditations at one Butt:
and beats vpon his text,
not the Cushion, making
his hearers not the Pulpit
groane. In citing of Popish
errors, he cuts them with
Arguments, not cudgels
them with barren inu|ctiues:

and labours more
to shew the truth of his
cause then the spleene. His
Sermon is limited by the
method, not the houre-glasse;
and his Deuotion
goes along with him out of
the Pulpit. Hee comes not
vp thrice a weeke because
he would not bee idle, nor
talkes three houres toge|ther,
because hee would
not talke nothing: but
his tongue Preaches at fit
times; and his conuersati|on
is the euery dayes exer|cise.
In matters of cere|monie
hee is not ceremo|nious,
but thinkes hee
owes that reuerence to the
Church to bow his iudge|ment

to it, and make more
conscience of schisme, then
a Surplesse. Hee esteemes
the Churches Hirarchie,
as the Churches glory, and
how-euer wee iarre with
Rome, would not haue our
confusion distinguish vs.
In Symoniacall purchases
he thinks his Soule goes in
the bargaine, and is loath
to come by promition so
deare. Yet his worth at
the length aduances him,
and the price of his owne
merit buyes him a Liuing.
He is no base Grater of his
Tythes, and will not wran|gle
for the odde Egge. The
Lawyer is the onely man
he hinders, he is spited for

taking vp quarrels. Hee
is a maine pillar of our
Church, though not yet
Deane nor Canon, and
his life our Religions best
Apologie: His death is his
last Sermon, where in the
Pulpit of his Bed hee in|structs
men to dye by his
example.


4. A meere dull
Physitian.
HIs practice is some bu|sinesse
at bed-sides,
and his speculation an V|rinall.
Hee is distinguish
from an Empericke by a

round veluet cap, and Do|ctors
gowne, yet no man
takes degrees more super|fluously,
for he is Doctor
howsoeuer. He is sworne
to Gale and Hypocrates, as
Vniuersity men to their sta|tutes,
though they neuer
saw them, and his discourse
is all Aphorismes, though
his reading be onely A|lexis
of Piemont, or the
Regiment of Health. The
best Cure hee ha's done is
vpon his own purse, which
from a leane sicklinesse he
hath made lusty, and in
flesh. His learning consists
much in reckoning vp the
hard names of diseases,
and the superscriptions of

Gally-pots in his Apothe|caries
Shoppe, which are
rank't in his Shelues, and
the Doctors memory. If he
haue been but a by-stander
at some desperate recoue|rie,
hee is slander'd with it,
though hee be guiltlesse;
and this breeds his reputa|tion,
and that his Practice;
for his skill is meerely opi|nion.
Of all odors he likes
best the smell of Vrine, and
holds Vespatians rule, that
no gaine is vnsauorie. If
you send this once to him,
you must resolue to be sick
howsoeuer, for he will ne|uer
leaue examining your
Water till he haue shak it
into a Disease. Then fol|lowes

a writ to his drugger
in a strange tongue, which
hee vnderstands though
he cannot conster. If he see
you himselfe, his presence
is the worst visitation: for
if hee cannot heale your
sicknesse, he will be sure to
helpe it. He translates his
Apothecaries Shop into
your Chamber, and the
verie Windowes and Ben|ches
must take Physicke.
He tels you your Maladie
in Greeke, though it be but
a cold, or head-ach: which
by good endeauor and di|ligence
hee may bring to
some moment indeed; his
most vnfaithfull act is, that
hee leaues a man gasping,

and his pretence is, death
and he haue a quarrell, and
must not meete; but his
feare is, least the Carcasse
should bleed. Anatomies
and other spectacles of
Mortality haue hardened
him, and hee's no more
struck with a Funerall then
a Graue-maker. Noble|men
vse him for a director
of their stomacks, and La|dies
for wantonnesse, espe|cially
if hee bee a proper
man. If he be single, he is
in league with his Shee-Apothecary,
and because
it is the Physitian, the hus|band
is Patient. If he haue
leasure to be idle (that is to
study) he ha's a smatch at

Alcumy, and is sicke of
the Pilosophers stone, a
disease vncurable, but by
an abundant Phlebotomy
of the purse. His two main
opposites are a Mounte|banke,
and a good Wo|man,
and he neuer shewes
his learning so much as in
an inuectiue against them,
and their boxes. In con|clusion
he is a sucking con|sumption,
and a very bro|ther
to the wormes, for
they are both ingendred
out of mans corruption.



5. An Alderman.
HEe is Venerable in his
Gowne, more in his
Beard, wherewith hee sets
not foorth so much his
owne, as the face of a Citie.
You must looke on him as
one of the Towne-Gates,
and consider him not as a
Body, but a Corporation.
His eminencie aboue o|thers
hath made him a
man of Worship, for hee
had neuer beene prefer'd,
but that hee was worth
thousands. Hee ouer-sees
the Common-wealth, as
his Shop, and it is an ar|gument
of his Policie, that
he has thriuen by his craft.

Hee is a rigorous Magi|strate
in his Ward: yet his
scale of Iustice is suspected,
least it bee like the Ballan|ces
in his Ware-house. A
ponderous man he is, and
substantial: for his weight
is commonly extraordina|rie,
and in his preferment
nothing Rises so much as
his Bellie. His Head is of
no great depth, yet well
furnisht, when it is in
coniunction with his Bre|thren,
may bring foorth a
Citie Apothegme, or some
such sage matter. Hee is
one that will not hastily
runne into error, for hee
treds with great deliberati|on,
 his iudgment consists

much in his pace. His dis|course
is commonly the
Annals of his Maioralty,
and what good gouerment
there was in the dayes of
his gold Chaine: though
his doore-posts were the
onely things that suffered
reformation: Hee seemes
not sincerely religious, e|specially
on solemne daies;
for he comes oft to Church
to make a shew. He is the
highest stayre of his pro|fession
and an example to
his Trade, what in time
they may come to. Hee
makes very much of his
authority; but more of
his Sattin Doublet; which,
though of good yeares,

bears its age very well, and
looks fresh euery Sunday;
But his Scarlet gowne is a
Monument, and lasts from
generation to generation.


6. A discontented
Man.
IS one that is falne out
with the world, and will
bee reuengd' on himselfe.
Fortune ha's deny'd him in
something, and hee now
takes pet, and will be mi|serable
in spite. The roote
of his disease is a selfe-hu|mouring
pride, and an ac|custom'd
tendernesse, not

to bee crot in his fancy
and the occasions commonly
one of these three
a hard father, a peeuish
wench, or his ambition
thwarted. Hee considered
not the nature of the world
till he felt it, and all blowes
fall on him heauier, because
they light not first on his
expectation. He has now
forgone all but his pride,
and is yet vaine glorious in
the ostentation of his me|lancholy.
His composure
of himselfe is a studied
carelesnesse with his armes
a crosse, and a neglected
hanging of his head and
cloake, and he is as great
an enemie to an hat-band,

as Fortune. He quarrels at
the time, and vp-starts, and
sighs at the neglect of men
of Parts, that is, such as
himselfe. His life is a per|petuall
Satyre, and hee is
still girding the ages vani|ty;
when this very an|ger
shewes he too much e|steemes
it. Hee is much
displeas'd to see men mer|ry,
and wonders what they
can find to laugh at. Hee
neuer drawes his own lips
higher then a smile, and
frownes wrinckle him be|fore
fortie. Hee at the last
fals into that deadly melan|choly
to bee a bitter hater
of men, and is the most apt
Companion for any mis|chiefe.

Hee is the sparke
that kindles the Common-wealth,
and the bellowes
himselfe to blow it: and if
he turn any thing, it is com|monly
one of these, either
Friar, traitor, or mad-man.


7. An Antiquary.
HE is a man strangely
thrifty of Time past,
 an enemy indeed to his
Maw, whence hee fetche
out many things when they
are now all rotten and
stinking. Hee is one tha
hath that vnnaturall dis|ease
to bee enamour'd o

old age, and wrinckles, and
loues all things (as Dutch|men
doe Cheese) the bet|ter
for being mouldy and
worme-eaten. He is of our
Religion, because we say
it is most ancient; and yet
a broken Statue would al|most
make him an Idola|ter.
A great admirer he is
of the rust of old Monu|ments,
and reades onely
those Charactars, where
time hath eaten out the
letters. Hee will goe you
forty miles to see a Saints
Well, or ruin'd Abbey:
and if there be but a Crosse
or stone foot-stoole in the
way, hee'l be considering
it so long, till he forget his

iourney. His estate consists
much in shekels, and Ro|man
Coynes, and he hath
more Pictures of Caesar,
then Iames or Elizabeth
Beggers coozen him with
musty things which they
haue rak't from dunghils,
and he preserues their rags
for precious Reliques. He
loues no Library, but
where there are more Spi|ders
volums then Authors,
and lookes with great ad|miration
on the Antique
worke of Cob-webs. Prin|ted
bookes he contemnes,
as a nouetly of this latter
age; but a Manu-script the
pores on euerlastingly, es|pecially
if the couer be all

Moth-eaten, and the dust
make a Parenthesis be|tweene
euerie Sillable. He
would giue all the Bookes
in his Studie (which are ra|rities
all) for one of the old
Romane binding, or sixe
lines of Tully in his owne
hand. His chamber is hung
commonly with strange
Beasts skins, and is a kind
of Charnel-house of bones
extraordinarie, and his dis|course
vpon them, if you
will heare him shall last
longer. His verie atyre is
that which is the eldest out
of fashion, and you may
picke a Criticism out of his
Breeches. He neuer lookes
vpon him self til he is gray-hair'd,

and then he is plea|sed
with his owne Anti|quity.
His Graue dos not
fright him, for he ha's been
vs'd to Sepulchers, and hee
likes Death the better, be|cause
it gathers him to his
Fathers.


9. Younger Brother.
HIs elder Brother was
the Esau, that came
out first and left him like
Iacob at his heeles. His fa|ther
ha's done with him, as
Phararh to the children of
Israel, that would haue
them make brick, and giue

them no straw, so he taskes
him to bee a Gentleman,
and leaues him nothing to
maintaine it. The pride of
his house has vndone him,
which the elder Knight|hood
must sustaine, and his
beggery that Knighthood.
His birth and bringing vp
will not suffer him to de|scend
to the meanes to get
wealth: but he stands at
the mercy of the world,
and which is worse of his
brother. He is something
better then the Seruing-men;
yet they more saucy
with him, then hee bold
with the master, who be|holds
him with a counte|nance
of sterne awe, and

checks him oftner then his
Liueries. His brothers old
suites and hee are much a|like
in request, and cast off
now and then one to the
other. Nature hath fur|nisht
him with a little
more wit vpon compassi|on;
for it is like to be his
best reuenew. If his An|nuity
stretch so farre he is
sent to the Vniuersity, and
with great heart-burning
takes vpon him the Mini|stry;
as a profession hee is
condemn'd, to by his ill
fortune. Other take a more
crooked path, yet the
Kings high-way, where
at length their vizzard is
pluck't off, and they strike

faire for Tiburne: but their
Brothers pride, not loue,
gets them a pardon. His
last refuge is the Low-countries,
where rags and
lice are no scandall, where
hee liues a poore Gentle|man
of a Company, and
dies without a shirt. The
onely thing that may bet|ter
his fortunes, is an art
hee ha's to make a Gentle|woman,
wherewith hee
baits now and then some
rich widow, that is hun|gry
after his blood. He is
commonly discontented,
and desperate, and the
forme of his exclamation
is, that Churle my Brother.
He loues not his country

for this vnnatural custome,
and would haue long since
reuolted to the Spaniard,
but for Kent onely which
he holds in admiration.


10. A meere for|mall
Man.
IS somewhat more then
the shape of a man; for
he has his length, breadth,
and colour. When you
haue seene his outside, you
haue lookt through him,
and need imploy your dis|couery
no farther. His rea|son
is meerly example, and
his action is not guided by

his vnderstanding, but he
sees other men doe thus,
and he followes them. He
is a Negatiue, for we can|not
call him a wise man,
but not a foole; nor an ho|nest
man, but not a knaue;
nor a Protestant, but not a
Papist. The chiefe burden
of his brain is the carriage
of his body, and the setting
of his face in a good frame:
which hee performes the
better, because hee is not
disiointed with other Me|ditations.
His Religion is
a good quiet subiect, and
he prayes, as he sweares, in
the Phrase of the Land. He
is a faire guest, and a faire
inuiter, and can excuse his

good cheere in the accusto|med
Apologie. Hee ha's
some faculty in mangling
of a Rabbet, and the distri|bution
of his morsell to a
neighbour trencher. Hee
apprehends a iest by seeing
men smile, and laughes or|derly
himselfe, when it
comes to his turne. His
discourse is the newes that
hee hath gathered in his
walke, and for other mat|ters
his discretion is, that
he will only what hee can,
that is, say nothing. His
life is like one that runnes
to the Minster-walke, to
take a turne, or two, and
so passes. He hath staid in
the world to fill a number;

and when he is gone, there
wants one, and there's an
end.


11. A Church-Papist.
IS one that parts his Re|ligion
betwixt his con|science
and his purse, and
comes to Church not to
serue God, but the King.
The face of the Law makes
him weare the maske of
the Gospel, which he vses
not as a meanes to saue his
soule, but charges. He loues
Popery well, but is loath to
lose by it, and though he be
somthing scar'd with the

Buls of Rome, yet they are
farre off, and he is strucke
with more terror at the
Apparitor. Once a moneth
he presents himselfe at the
Church, to keepe off the
Church warden,  brings
in his body to saue his
bayle. He kneels with the
Congregation, but prayes
by himselfe, and asks God
forgiuenesse for comming
thither. If he be forc'd to
stay out a Sermon, he puts
his hat ouer his eyes, and
frowns out the houre, and
when hee comes home,
thinkes to make amends
for this fault by abusing
the Preacher. His maine
policy is to shift off the

Communion, for which
he is neuer vnfurnish't of a
quarrell, and will be sure
to be out of Charity at Ea|ster;
and indeed lies not,
for hee ha's a quarrell to
the Sacrament. He would
make a bad Martyr, and
good trauellor, for his con|science
is so large, he could
neuer wander out of it, and
in Constantinople would
be circumcis'd with a re|seruation.
His wife is more
zealous, and therfore more
costly, and he bates her in
tyres, what she stands him
in Religion. But we leaue
him hatching plots against
the State, and expecting
Spinola.



12. A selfe conceited
Man.
IS one that knowes him|selfe
so well that he does
not know himselfe. Two
excellent well-dones haue
vndone him; and hee is
guilty, that first commen|ded
him to madnesse. He
is now become to his owne
booke, which he poares on
continually, yet like a tru|ant-reader
skips ouer the
harsh places and surueyes
onely that which is plea|sant.
In the speculation of
his owne good parts, his
eyes like a drunkards see
all double, and his fancy

like an old mans specta|cles,
make a great letter in
a small print. He imagines
euery place where hee
comes his Theater, and
not a looke stirring, but his
spectator; and conceiues
mens thoughts to be very
idle, that is, busie about
him. His walke is still in
the fashion of a March, and
like his opinion vnaccom|panyed,
with his eyes most
fixt vpon his owne person,
or on others with reflecti|on
to himselfe. If he haue
done any thing that ha's
past with applause, he is
alwayes re-acting it alone,
and conceits the extasie his
hearers were in at euery

period. His discourse is all
positions, and definitiue
decrees, with thus it must
be, and thus it is, and hee
will not humble his autho|rity
to proue it. His tenent
is alwayes singular, and
aloofe from the vulgar as
he can, from which you
must not hope to wrest
him. Hee ha's an excellent
humor, for an heretique,
and in these dayes made
the first Arminian. He pre|fers
Ramus before Aristotle,
Paracelsus before Galen,
and whosoeuer with most
Paradox is commended, 
Lipsius his hopping stile,
before either Tully or Quin|tilian.
He much pities the

World, that ha's no more
in sight in his Parts, when
he is too well discouered,
euen to this very thoght. A
flatterer is a dunce to him,
for he can tell him nothing
but what hee knowes be|fore,
and yet he loues him
to, because he is like him|selfe.
Men are mercifull to
him, and let him alone, for
if he be once driuen from
his humor, he is like two
inward friends fallen out;
His own bitter enemy, and
discontent presently makes
a murther. In summe, he
is a bladder blown vp with
wind, which the least flaw
crushes to nothing.



13. A Tauerne.
IS a degree, or (if you
will) a paire of stayres
aboue an Alehouse, where
men are drunke with more
credit and Apologie. If the
Vintners nose be at dore,
it is a signe sufficient, but
the absence of this is sup|plyed
by the Iuie-bush.
The rooms are ill breath'd,
like the drinkers that haue
been washt wel ouer night,
and are smelt too fasting
next morning; not furnisht
with Beds apt to be defil'd,
but more necessary imple|ments,
Stooles, Table, and
a Chamber-pot. It is a

broacher of more newes
then hogs-heads,  more
iests then newes, which are
sukt vp heere by some
spungie braine, and from
thence squeazed into a Co|medy.
Men come here to
make merry, but indeed
make a noise, and this mu|sicke
aboue is answered
with the clinking below.
The Drawers are the ci|uilest
people in it, men of
good bringing vp, and
howsoeuer we esteeme of
them, none can boast more
iustly of their high calling.
Tis the best Theater of na|tures,
where they are true|ly
acted, not plaid, and the
busines as in the rest of the

world vp and downe, to
wit, from the bottome of
the Seller to the great
Chamber. A melancholy
man would finde heere
matter to worke vpon,
to see Heads as brittle as
Glasses, and ofter bro|ken.
Men come hither to
quarrell, and come hither
to be made friends, and if
Plutarch will lend me his
Simile, it is euen Tele|phus
his sword that makes
wounds, and cures them.
It is the common co~sump|tion
of the Afternoone,
and the murderer, or ma|ker
away of a rainy day. It
is the Torrid Zone that
scorches the face, and To|bacco

the gun-powder that
blowes it vp. Much harme
would be done, if the cha|ritable
Vintener had not
Water readie for these
flames. A house of sinne
you may call it but not a
house of darknesse for the
Candles are neuer out, and
it is like those Countries
farre in the North, where
it is as cleare at mid-night
as at mid-day. After a long
sitting, it becomes like a
street in a dashing showre,
where the spouts are flush|ing
aboue, and the Con|duits
running below, while
the Iordans like swel|ling
riuers ouerflow their
bankes. To giue you the

totall reckoning of it. It is
the busie mans recreation,
the idle mans businesse, the
melancholy mans Sanctu|ary,
the strangers welcome,
the Innes a Court mans
entertainment, the schol|lers
kindnesse, and the Ci|tizens
curtesie. It is the stu|die
of sparkling wits, and a
cup of Canary their book,
where we leaue them.


14. A too idly reseru'd
Man.
IS one that is a foole with
discretion: or a strange
piece of Politician, that
manages the state of him|selfe,

His Actions are his
Priuie Counsell, wherein
no man must partake be|side.
He speakes vnder rule
and prescription, and dare
not shew his teeth without
Machiauell. He conuerses
with his neighbours as he
would in Spaine, and feares
an inquisitiue man as much
as the inquisition. Hee sus|pects
all questions for exa|minations,
and thinks you
would pick something out
of him, and auoids you: His
brest is lik a gentlewomans
closet, which locks vp eue|rie
toye and trifle, or some
bragging Mounte-banke,
that makes euerie stinking
thing a secret. He deliuers

you common matters with
great coniuration. of si|lence,
and whispers you
in the eare Acts of Parlia|ment.
You may as soone
wrest a tooth from him as
a paper, and whatsoeuer he
reads is letters. He dares
not talke of great men for
feare of bad Comments,
and he knowes not how
his words may bee misap|plyed.
Aske his opinion
and he tels you his doubt:
and hee neuer heares a|ny
thing more astonishtly
then what he knowes be|fore.
His words are like the
Cards at Primiuiste, where
6. is 18. and 7. 21. for they
neuer signifie what they

sound; but if he tell you he
wil do a thing, it is as much
as if hee swore he would
not. He is one indeed that
takes all men to be craftier
then they are, and puts
himselfe to a great deale of
affliction to hinder their
plots, and designes where
they meane freely. Hee
ha's beene long a riddle
himselfe, but at last finds
Oedipusses; for his ouer-a|cted
dissimulation disco|uers
him, and men doe
with him as they would
with Hebrew letters, spell
him backwards, and read
him.



15. A Sharke.
IS one whome all other
meanes haue fayl'd, and
hee now liues of himselfe.
He is some needy casheir'd
fellow, whom the World
has oft flung off, yet still
claspes againe, and is like
one a drowning, fastens
vpon any thing that's next
at hand, amongst other of
his Shipwrackes hee has
happyly lost shame, and
this want supplies him. No
man puts his Braine to
more vse then hee, for his
life is a dayly inuention,
and each meale a new stra|tagem.
Hee has an excel|lent

memorie for his ac|quaintance,
though there
past but how doe you be|twixt
them seuen yeeres
agoe, it shall suffice for an
Imbrace, and that for mo|ney.
He offers you a Pottle
of Sacke out of his ioy to
see you, and in requitall of
this courtesie, you can doe
no lesse then pay for it. He
is fumbling with his purse-strings,
as a Schoole-boy
with his points, when hee
is going to bee Whipt, till
the Master wearie with
long Stay, forgiues him.
When the reckoning is
payd, he sayes it must not
bee so, it is strait pacified,
and cryes what remedie.

His borrowings are like
Subsidies, each man a shil|ling
or two, as he can well
dispend, which they lend
him not with the hope to
be repayd, but that he will
come no more. He holds a
strange tyranny ouer men,
for he is their debtor, and
they feare him as a credi|tor.
He is proud of any im|ployment,
though it bee
but to carry commendati|ons,
which he will be sure
to deliuer at eleuen of the
clocke. They in curtesie
bid him stay,  he in man|ners
cannot deny them. If
he find but a good looke
to assure his welcom, he be|comes
their halfe boord|er,

and haunts the thresh|hold
so long, till he forces
good natures to the necessi|ty
of a quarrell. Publique
iuuitations hee will not
wrong with his absence,
and is the best witnesse of
the Sheriffes Hospitality.
Men shun him at length as
they would doe an infecti|on,
and he is neuer crost in
his way, if there be but a
lane to escape him. He ha's
done with the Age as his
clothes to him, hung on as
long as he could, and at
last drops off.



16. A Carrier.
IS his own Hackneyman
for hee lets himselfe out
to trauel as well as his hor|ses.
Hee is the ordina|rie
Embassadour betweene
Friend and Friend, and
brings rich Presents to the
one, but neuer returnes any
backe againe. He is no vn|letter'd
man, though in
shew simple, for question|lesse,
hee has much in his
Budget, which hee can
vtter too in fit time and
place; He is the Vault in
Gloster Church, that con|ueyes
Whispers at a di|stance;
for hee takes the

sound out of your mouth
at Yorke, and makes it bee
heard as farre as London.
Hee is the young Students
ioy and expectation, and
their most accepted guest,
to whom they lend a wil|ling
hand to discharge him
of his burthen. His first
greeting is, Your Friends
are well; then in a piece of
Gold deliuers their Bles|sig.
You would thinke
him a Churlish blunt fel|low,
but they find in him
many tokens of humani|tie.
He is a great afflicter of
the High-way, and beates
them out of mesure, which
iniury is somtimes reuengd
by the Purse-taker;  then

the Voyage miscaries. No
mandomineers more in his
Inne, nor cals his Host vn|reuerently
with more pre|sumption,
and this arro|gance
proceeds out of the
strength of his Horses. He
forgets not his load where
he takes his ease, for he is
drunke commonly before
he goes to bed. He is like
the Prodigall Child, still
packing away, and still re|turning
againe. But let him
passe.



17. An old Colledge
Butler.
IS none of the worst Stu|dents
in the house, for he
keeps the set houres at his
booke more duly then any.
His authority is great ouer
mens good names, which
hee charges many times
with shrewd aspersions,
which they hardly wipe
off without payment. His
Boxe and Counters proue
him to bee a man of reck|oning;
yet he is stricter in
his accounts then a Vsu|rer,
and deliuers not a far|thing
without writing. He
doubles the pains of Gallo|belgicus,

for his bookes
goe out once a quarter, and
they are much in the same
nature, briefe notes and
summes of affaires, and are
out of request as soone. His
commings in are like a
Taylors from the shreds of
bread, the chippings, and
remnants of the broken
crust: excepting his vailes
from the barrell, which
poore folkes buy for their
hogs, but drinke them|selues.
He diuides a halfe-peny
loafe with more
subtilty then Kekerman,
and sub-diuides the a pri|mo
ortum so nicely, that
a stomacke of great ca|pacity
can hardly appre|hend

it. Hee is a very so|ber
man considering his
manifold temptations of
drinke and strangers, and
if hee be ouer-seene, tis
within his owne liber|ties,
and no man ought
to take exceptions. He is
neuer so well pleas'd with
his place, as when a Gen|tleman
is beholding to him
for shewing him the Butte|ry,
whom hee greets with
a cup of single beere and
slyst manchet, and tels him
tis the fashion of the Col|ledge.
Hee domineers o|uer
Fresh-men when they
first come to the Hatch,
and puzzles them with
strange language of Cues,

and Cees, and some bro|ken
Latine which he ha's
learnt at his Bin. His fa|culties
extraordinary, is
the warming of a paire of
Cards, and telling out a
doozen of Counters for
Post and Paire, and no
man is more methodicall
in these businesses. Thus
hee spends his age, till
the appe of it is runne
out, and then a fresh one
is set abroach.



18. An vp-start Coun|trey
Knight.
HIs honour was some|what
preposterous,
for hee bare the Kings
sword before he had armes
to wield it; yet being once
laid ore the shoulder with
a Knighthood, he finds the
Herauld his friend. His
father was a man of good
stocke, though but a Tan|ner,
or Vsurer; hee pur|chast
the Land, and his son
the Title. He ha's dot off
the name of a Clowne, but
the looke not so easie, and
his face beares still a relish
of Churne-milke. Hee is

garded with more gold
lace then all the Gentle|men
o'th Country, yet his
body makes his clothes stil
out of fashion. His house-keeping
is seene much in
the distinct families of
Dogges, and Seruing-men
attendant on their kennels,
and the deepenesse of their
throats is the depth of his
discourse. A Hauke he e|steemes
the true burthen
of Nobility, and is excee|ding
ambitious to seeme
delighted in the sport, and
haue his fist glou'd with
his Iesses. A Iustice of
peace hee is to domineere
in his Parish, and doe his
neighbour wrong with

more right. And very scan|dalous
he is in his autho|rity,
for no sinne almost
which hee will not com|mit.
Hee will be drunke
with his hunters for com|pany,
and staine his Gen|tility
with droppings of
Ale. He is fearfull of being
Sheriffe of the Shire by in|stinct,
and dreads the Size-weeeke
as much as the Pri|soner.
In summe, he is but
a clod of his owne earth,
or his Land is the Dung+hill,
and he the Cocke that
crowes ouer it. And com|monly
his race is quickly
runne, and his Childrens
Children, though they
scape hanging, returne to

the place from whence
they came.


19. A Gallant.
IS one that was born and
shapt for his cloathes:
and if Adam had not falne,
had liu'd to no purpose.
Hee gratulates therefore
the first sinne, and fig|leaues
that were an occa|sion
of brauery. His first
care is his dresse, the nex
his bodie, and in the vni|ting
of these two lies his
soule and its faculties. He
obserues London trulier
then the Termers, and his

businesse is the street: the
Stage, the Court, and
those places where a pro|per
man is best showne.
If hee be qualified in ga|ming
extraordinary, he is
so much the more gentile
and compleate, and hee
learnes the best oathes for
the purpose. These are a
great part of his discourse,
 he is as curious in their
newnesse as the fashion.
His other talke is Ladies
and such pretty things, or
some iest at a Play. His
Pick-tooth beares a great
part in his discourse, so
does his body; the vpper
parts whereof are as starcht
as his linnen, and per|chance

vse the same Laun|dresse.
Hee has learnt to
ruffle his face from his
Boote, and takes great de|light
in his walke to heare
his Spurs gingle. Though
his life passe somewhat sli|dingly,
yet he seemes very
carefull of the time, for
hee is still drawing his
Watch out of his Poket,
and spends part of his
houres in numbring them.
He is one neuer serious but
with his Taylor, when hee
is in conspiracie for the
next deuice. He is furnisht
his Iests, as some wande|rer
with Sermons, some
three for all Congregati|ons,
one especially against

the Scholler, a man to him
much ridiculous, whome
hee knowes by no other
definition, but a silly fel|low
in blacke. He is a kind
of walking Mercers Shop,
and shewes you one Stuffe
to day, and another to+morrow;
an ornament to
the roomes he comes in, as
the faire Bed and Hang|ings
be; and is meerely ra|table
accordingly, fiftie or
an hundred Pound as his
suit is. His maine ambition
is to get a Knight-hood,
and then an olde Ladie,
which if he be happy in, he
fils the Stage and a Coach
so much longer. Other|wise,
himselfe and his

Cloathes grow stale toge|ther,
and he is buried com|monly
ere hee dies in the
Gaole, or the Country.


20. A Constable.
IS a Vice-roy in the street,
and no man stands more
vpon't that he is the Kings
Officer. His iurisdiction
extends to the next stocks,
where he ha's Commissi|on
for the heeles onely, and
sets the rest of the body at
liberty. Hee is a scar-crow
to that Alehouse, where he
drinkes not his mornings
draught, and apprehends

a Drunkard for not stan|ding
in the Kings name.
Beggers feare him more
then the Iustice, and as
much as the Whip-stocke,
whom hee deliuers ouer
to his subordinate Magi|strates,
the Bride-wel-man,
and the Beadle. Hee is a
great stickler in the tu|mults
of double Iugges,
and venters his head by
his Place, which is broke
many times to keep whole
the peace. He is neuer so
much in his Maiesty as in
his Night-watch, where
hee sits in his Chayre of
State, a Shop-stall, and in|uiron'd
with a guard of
Halberts, examines all pas|sengers.

He is a very care|full
man in his Office, but
if hee stay vp after mid|night,
you shall take him
napping.


21. A downe right
Sholler.
IS one that has much
learning in the Ore, vn|wrought
and vntryde,
which time and experience
fashions and refines. He is
good mettall in the inside,
though rough  vnscour'd
without, and therefore ha|ted
of the Courtier, that is
quite contrarie. The time

has got a veine of making
him ridiculous, and men
laugh at him by tradition,
and no vnluckie absurdity,
but is put vpon his profes|sion,
and done like a Schol|ler.
But his fault is onely
this, that his mind is some|what
much taken vp with
his mind, and his thoughts
not loaden with any car|riage
besides. Hee has not
put on the quaint Garbe
of the Age, which is now
become a mans Totall. He
has not humbled his Me|ditations
to the industrie of
Complement, not afflicted
his braine in an elaborate
legge. His body is not set
vpon nice Pinnes, to bee

turning and flexible for e|uery
motion, but his scrape
is homely, and his nod
worse. He cannot kisse his
hand and cry Madame,
nor talke idly enough to
beare her company. His
smacking of a Gentle-wo|man
is somewhat too sa|uory,
and he mistakes her
nose for her lippe. A very
Woodcock would puzzle
him in caruing, and hee
wants the logicke of a Ca|pon.
He has not the glib fa|culty
of sliding ouer a tale,
but his words come squea|mishly
out of his mouth,
and the laughter common|ly
before the iest. He names
this word Colledge too of|ten,

and his discourse beats
too much on the Vniuersi|ty.
The perplexity of man|nerlinesse
will not let him
feed, and he is sharpe set at
an Argument when hee
should cut his meate. He is
discarded for a gamester at
all games but one and thir|ty,
and at tables he reaches
not beyond doublets. His
fingers are not long and
drawn out to handle a Fid|dle,
but his fist is clunch't
with the habite of dispu|ting.
He ascends a Horse
somwhat sinisterly, though
not on the left side, and
they both goe iogging in
griefe together. He is ex|ceedingly
censur'd by the

Innes a Court men, for
that hainous Vice being
out of fashion. Hee cannot
speake to a Dogge in his
owne Dialect, and vnder|stands
Greeke better then
the language of a Falconer.
Hee has beene vsed to a
darke roome, and darke
Clothes, and his eyes daz|zle
at a Sattin Doublet.
The Hermitage of his Stu|dy,
has made him somwhat
vncouth in the world, and
men make him worse by
staring on him. Thus is he
silly and ridiculous, and it
continues with him for
some quarter of a yeare,
out of the Vniuersitie. But
practise him a little in men,

and brush him ore with
good companie, and hee
shall out-ballance those
glisterers as much as a so|lid
substance do's a feather,
or Gold Gold-lace.


22. A Player.
HE knows the right vse
of the World, where
in he comes to play a part
and so away. His life is not
idle for it is all Action, and
no man need be more wary
in his doings, for the eyes
of all men are vpon him.
His Profession ha's in it a
kind of contradiction, for
none is more dislik'd, and

yet none more applauded;
and he ha's this misfor|tude
of some Scholler, too
much wit makes him a
foole. He is like our pain|ting
Gentle-women, sel|dome
in his owne face, sel|domer
in his cloathes, and
he pleases, the better hee
counterfeits, except onely
when he is disguis'd with
straw for gold lace. Hee
do's not only personate on
the Stage, but sometime in
the Street, for he is mask'd
still in the habit of a Gen|tleman.
His Parts find him
oathes and good words,
which he keeps for his vse
and Discourse, and makes
shew with them of a fashi|onable

Companion. He is
tragicall on the Stage, but
rampant in the Tyring-house,
and sweares oathes
there which he neuer con'd.
The waiting women Spe|ctators
are ouer-eares in
loue with him, and Ladies
send for him to act in their
Chambers. Your Innes of
Court men were vndone
but for him, hee is their
chiefe guest and imploy|ment,
and the sole busines
that makes them After|noones
men; The Poet on|ly
is his Tyrant, and he is
bound to make his friends
friend drunk at his charges.
Shroue-tuesday hee feares
as much as the Baudes, and

Lent is more damage to
him then the Butcher. He
was neuer so much discre|dited
as in one Act,  that
was of Parliament, which
giues Hostlers Priuiledge
before him, for which hee
abhors it more then a cor|rupt
Iudge. But to giue him
his due, one wel-furnisht
Actor has enough in him
for fiue common Gentle|men,
and if he haue a good
body for sixe, and for reso|lution,
hee shall Challenge
any Cato, for it has beene
his practise to die brauely.



23. A Detractor.
IS one of a more cunning
and actiue enuy, where|with
he gnaws not foolish|ly
himselfe, but throwes
it abroad and would haue
it blister others. He is com|monly
some weake parted
fellow, and worse minded,
yet is strangely ambitious
to match others, not by
mounting their worth, but
bringing them down with
his Tongue to his owne
poorenesse. Hee is indeed
like the red Dragon that
pursued the woman, for
when hee cannot ouer|reach
another, hee opens

his mouth and throwes a
flood after to drowne him.
You cannot anger him
worse then to do well, and
hee hates you more bitter|ly
for this, then if you had
cheated him of his patri|mony
with your owne dis|credit.
He is alwayes sligh|ting
the generall opinion,
and wondring why such
and such men should bee
applauded. Commend a
good Diuine, hee cryes
Postilling, a Philologer
Pedantrie, a Poet Ry|ming,
a Schoole man dull
wrangling, a sharpe con|ceite,
Boy-ishnesse; an
honest Man plasibilitie.
Hee comes to Publique

things not to learne, but to
catch, and if there bee but
one soloecisme, that's all he
carries away. Hee lookes
on all things with a pre|pared
sowrenesse, and is
still furnisht with a Pish
before hand, or some musty
Prouerbe that dis-relishes
all things whatsoeuer. If
feare of the company make
him second a commendati|on,
it is like a Law-writ, al|waies
with a clause and ex|ception,
or to smooth his
way to some greater scan|dall.
Hee will grant you
somthing, and bate more;
and this bating shal in con|clusion
take away all hee
granted. His speech con|cludes

still with an Oh but,
and I coud wish one thing
amended; and this one
thing shal be enough to de|face
all his former com|mendations.
Hee will bee
very inward with a man to
fish some bad out of him,
and make his slanders here|after
more authenticke,
when it is said a friend re|ported
it. He will inueigle
you to naughtinesse to get
your good name into his
clutches, and make you
drunk to shew you reeling.
He passes the more plausi|bly
because all men haue a
smatch of his humour, and
it is thought freenes which
is malice. If he can say no|thing

of a man, hee will
seeme to speak riddles, as if
he could tell strange stories
if he would: and when he
has rackt his inuention to
the vttermost, hee ends:
But I wish him well, and
therfore must hold my
peace. He is alwayes list|ning
and enquiring after
men, and suffers not a
cloake to passe by him vn|examin'd.
In briefe, hee is
one that has lost all good
himselfe, and is loth to find
it in another.



24. A meere young Gen|man
of the Vni|uersitie.
IS one that comes there
to weare a gown, and to
say hereafter, he has beene
at the Vniuersitie. His Fa|ther
sent him thither, be|cause
hee heard there were
the best Fencing and Dan|cing-Schooles,
from these
he has his Education, from
his Tutor the ouer-sight.
The first Element of his
knowledge is to be shewne
the Colledges, and initia|ted
in a Tauerne by the
way, which hereafter hee
wil learne of himselfe. The
two markes of his Seniori|tie,

is the bare Veluet of his
gowne, and his proficien|cie
at Tennis, where when
hee can once play a Set,
he is a Fresh-man no more.
His Studie has common|ly
handsome Shelues, his
Bookes near Silke strings,
which he shewes to his Fa|thers
man, and is loth to
vntye or take downe for
feare of misplacing. Vpon
foule dayes for recreation
hee retyres thither, and
looks ouer the prety booke
his Tutor Reades to him,
which is commonly some
short Historie, or a piece of
Euphormio; for which his
Tutor giues him Money
to spend next day. His

maine loytering is at the
Library, where he studies
Armes and bookes of Ho|nour,
and turnes a Gentle|man-Critick
in Pedigrees.
Of all things he endures
not to bee mistaken for a
Scholler, and hates a black
suit though it be of Sattin.
His companion is ordina|rily
some stale fellow, that
ha's beene notorious for
an Ingle to gold hatbands,
whom he admires at first,
afterward scornes. If hee
haue spirit or wit, he may
light of better company,
and may learne some fla|shes
of wit, which may
doe him Knights seruice in
the Country hereafter. But

hee is now gon to the Inns
of Court, where he studies
to forget what hee learn'd
before, his acquaintance
and the fashion.


25. A Pot-Poet.
IS the dreggs of wit; yet
mingled with good drink
mae haue some relish. His
Inspirations are more reall
then others; for they doe
but faine a God, but he has
his by him. His Verses run
like the Tap, and his in|uention
as the Barrell, ebs
and flowes at the mercy of
the spiggot. In thin drinke

hee aspires not aboue a
Ballad, but a cup of Sacke
inflames him, and sets his
Muse and Nose a fire to|gether.
The Presse is his
Mint, and stamps him now
and then a sixe pence or
two in reward of the ba|ser
coyne his Pamphlet.
His Workes woul 
sell for three halfe-pence,
though they are giuen oft
for three Shillings, but for
the prety Title that allures
the Country Gentleman:
and for which the Printer
maintaines him in Ale a
fortnight. His Verses are
like his clothes, miserable
Cento's and patches, yet
their pace is not altogether

so hobbling as an Alma|nacks.
The death of a great
man or the burning of a
house furnish him with
an Argument, and the
nine Muses are out strait
in mourning gownes, and
Melpomine cryes Fire, Fire.
His other Poems are but
Briefs in Rime, and like the
poore Greekes collections
to redeeme from captiuity.
He is a man now much im|ploy'd
in commendations
of our Nauy, and a bit|ter
inueigher against the
Spaniard. His frequent'st
Workes goe out in single
sheets, and are chanted
from market to market, to
a vile tune, and a worse

throat, whilst the poore
Country wench melts like
her butter to heare them.
And these are the Stories
of some men of Tyburne,
or a strange Monster out
of Germany: or sitting in
a Baudy-house; hee writes
Gods Iudgements. Hee
ends at last in some ob|scure
painted Cloth, to
which himselfe made the
Verses, and his life like a
Canne too full spils vpon
the bench. He leaues twen|ty
shillings on the score,
which my Hostesse looses.



26. A Cooke.
THe Kitchin is his Hel,
and hee the Diuell in
it, where his meate aud he
frye together. His Reuen|nues
are showr'd downe
from the fat of the Land,
and he enter-lards his own
grease among to helpe the
drippings. Colericke hee
is, not by nature so much
as his Art,  it is a shrewd
temptation that the chop|ping
knife is so neare. His
weapons ofter offensiue,
are a messe of hot broth,
and scalding water, and
woe be to him that comes
in his way. In the Kitchin

he wil domineere, and rule
the roste, in spight of his
Master, and Curses is the
very Dialect of his Cal|ling.
His labour is meere
blustring and furie, and his
Speech like that of Sailors
in a storme, a thousand bu|sinesses
at once, yet in all
this tumult hee do's not
loue cumbustion, but will
be the first man that shall
goe and quench it. Hee is
neuer good Christian till a
hizzing Pot of Ale has
slak't him, like Water cast
on a fire-brand,  for that
time he is tame and dispo|sest.
His cunning is not
small in Architecture, for
he builds strange Fabricks

in Paste, Towres and Ca|stles,
which are offered to
the assault of valiant teeth,
and like Darius his Pal|lace,
in one Banquet de|molisht.
Hee is a pittilesse
murderer of Innocents,
and hee mangles poore
foules with vnheard of tor|tures,
and it is thought the
Martyrs persecutions were
deuised from hence, sure
we are S^t. Lawrence his
Gridiron came out of his
Kitchin. His best facultie
is at the Dresser, where he
seemes to haue great skill
in the Tactickes, ranging
his Dishes in order Milita|rie,
and placing with great
discretion in the fore-front

meates more strong and
hardy and the more cold
and cowardly in the reare,
as quaking Tarts, and qui|uerig
Custards, and such
milke-sop Dishes which
scape many times the fu|ry
of the encounter. But
now the second Course is
gone vp, and hee downe
into the Sellar, where
hee drinkes and sleepes
till foure a clocke in the
afternoone, and then re|turnes
againe to his Re|giment.



27. A forward bold
Man.
IS a lusty fellow in a
crowd, that's beholding
more to his elbow then his
legges, for he do's not goe
but thrusts well. Hee is a
good shuffler in the world,
wherin he is so oft putting
forth, that at length he puts
on. He can doe something,
but dare doe much more,
and is like a desperate sol|dier,
who will assault any
thing where he is sure not
to enter. He is not so well-opinion'd
of himselfe, as
industrious to make other;
and thinks no vice so pre|iudiciall

as blushing. Hee
is still citing for himselfe,
that a candle should not
be hid vnder a bushell, and
for his part, he will be sure
not to hide his, thogh his
candle be but a snuffe or
Rush-candle. These few
good parts hee has, he is
no niggard in displaying,
and is like some needy
flanting gold-smith, no
thing in the inner roome,
but all on the np-boord:
If he be a scholler, he ha's
commonly stept into the
Pulpit before a degree;
yet into that too before he
deseru'd it. He neuer de|ferres
S. Maries beyond
his regencie, and his next

Sermon is at Pruls Crosse,
and that printed. He loues
publike things alife: and
for any solemne entertain|ment
he will find a mouth,
find a speech who will.
Hee is greedy of great ac|quaintance
and many,
and thinkes it no small ad|uancement
to rise to bee
knowne. His talke at the ta|ble
is like Beniamins messe,
fiue times to his part, and
no argument shuts him out
for a quarrellour. Of all
disgraces he indures not to
be Non-plust, and had ra|ther
flye for Sanctuary to
Non-sense, which few can
descry, then to nothing
which all. His boldnesse is

beholding to other mens
modestie, which rescues
him many times from a
Bafflle; yet his face is good
Armour, and hee is dasht
out of any thing sooner
then Countenance. Gros|ser
conceites are puzzel'd
in him for a rare man, and
wiser men, though they
know him, take him for
their pleasure, or as they
would doe a Sculler for be|ing
next at hand. Thus
preferment at last stum|bles
on him because hee is
still in the way. His Com|panions
that flouted him
before, now enuie him,
when they see him come
readie for Scarlet, whilst

themselues lye Mustie in
their old Clothes and Col|ledges.


28. A Baker.
NO man verifies the
Prouerbe more, that
it is an Almes-deed to pu|nish
him: for his penalty is
a Dole, and do's the Beg|gers
as much good as their
Dinner. He abhors there|fore
workes of Charitie,
and thinkes his Bread cast
away when it is giuen to
the poore. He loues not Iu|stice
neither, for the weigh-scales
sake, and hates the

Clarke of the Market as
his Executioner: yet hee
findes mercy in his offen|ces,
and his Basket onely
is sent to Prison. Marry
a Pillory is his deadly ene|my,
and he neuer heares
well after.


30. A plaine Country
Fellow.
IS one that manures his
ground wel, but lets him|selfe
lie fallow and vntil'd.
Hee has reason enough to
doe his businesse, and not
enough to be idle or me|lancholy.
Hee seemes to

haue the iudgement of Na|buchadnezar
for his con|uersation
is among beasts,
and his tallons none of the
shortest, only he eates not
grasse, because he loues not
sallets. His hand guids the
Plough, and the Plough
his thoughts, and his ditch
and landmarke is the ve|ry
mound of his meditati|ons.
He expostulates with
his Oxen very vnderstan|dingly,
and speakes Gee
and Ree better then En|glish.
His mind is not much
distracted with obiects,
but if a good fat Cowe
come in his way, he stands
dumbe and astonisht, and
though his haste be ne|uer

so great, will fixe here
halfe an houres contem|plation.
His habitation is
some poore Thatcht roofe,
distinguisht from his Barn,
by the loope-holes that let
out smoak, which the raine
had long since Washt tho|row,
but for the double see|ling
of Bacon on the inside,
which has hung ther from
his Grandsires time, and is
yet to make rashers for po|sterity.
His Dinner is his o|ther
worke, for he sweats at
it as much as at his labour;
he is a terrible fastner on a
piece of Beefe, and you may
hope to staue the Guard
off sooner. His Religion is
a part of his Copy-hold,

which hee takes from his
Land-lord, and referres it
wholly to his discretion.
Yet if hee giue him leaue,
he is a good Christian to
his power (that is) comes
to Church in his best
clothes, and sits there with
his Neighbours, where he
is capable onely of two
Praiers, for raine, and faire
weather. Hee apprehends
Gods blessings onely in a
Good Yeere, or a Fat pa|sture,
and neuer praises
him bu on good ground.
Sunday he esteemes a day
to make merrie in, and
thinkes a Bag-pipe as es|sentiall
to it, as Euening
Prayer, where hee walkes

very solemnly after seruice
with his hands coupled
behind him, and censures
the dauncing of his parish.
His complement with his
Neighbour is a good
thumpe on the backe; and
his salutation commonly
some blunt Curse. Hee
thinkes nothing to bee vi|ces
but Pride and ill-hus|bandrie,
from which hee
wil grauely disswade youth
and has some thriftie Hob|nayle
Prouerbes to Clout
his discourse. Hee is a nig|gard
all the Weeke except
onely Market-day, where
if his Corne sell well, hee
thinkes he may be drunke
with a good Conscience.

His feete neuer stinke so
vnbecommingly as when
hee trots after a Lawyer
in West-minsterhall, and
euen cleaues the ground
with hard scraping, in be|seeching
his Worship to
take his money. Hee is
sensible of no calamitie but
the burning of a Stacke of
Corne, or the ouer-flowing
of a Medow, and thinkes
Noahs Flood the greatest
Plague that euer was, not
because it Drowned the
World, but spoyl'd the
grasse. For Death hee is
neuer troubled, and if hee
get in but his Haruest be|fore,
let it come when it wil
he cares not.



31. A Young-man.
HEe is now out of
Natures protection,
though not yet able to
guide himselfe. But left
loose to the World, and
Fortune, from which the
weaknesse of his Child|hood
preseru'd him: and
now his strength exposes
him. Hee is indeed iust of
age to be miserable, yet in
his owne conceit first be|gins
to be happy; and hee
is happier in this imagina|tion,
and his misery not
felt is lesse. He sees yet but
the outside of the World
and Men, and conceiues

them according to their
appearing glister, and out
of this ignorance beleeues
them. He pursues all vani|ties
for happinesse, and
enioyes them best in this
fancy. His reason serues
not to curbe but vnder|stand
his appetite, and
prosecute the motions
thereof with a more ea|ger
earnestnes. Himselfe is
his owne temptation, and
needs not Satan; and the
World will come hereaf|ter.
Hee leaues repentance
for gray hayres, and per|formes
it in being coue|tous.
Hee is mingled with
the vices of the age as the
fashion and custome, ith

which hee longs to bee ac|quainted;
and Sinnes to
better his vnderstanding.
He conceiues his Youth as
the season of his Lust, and
the Houre wherein hee
ought to bee bad: and be|cause
he would not lose his
time, spends it. He distasts
Religion as a sad thing, and
is sixe yeeres elder for a
thought of Heauen. Hee
scornes and feares, and yet
hopes for old age, but dare
not imagine it with wrin|cles.
Hee loues and hates
with the same inflamation:
and when the heate is ouer
is coole alike to friends and
enemies. His friendship is
seldome so stedfast but that

lust, drinke, or anger may
ouerturne it. He offers you
his blood to day in kind|nesse,
and is readie to take
yours to morrow. He do's
seldome any thing which
hee wishes not to doe a|gaine,
and is onely wise af|ter
a misfortune. Hee suf|fers
much for his know|ledge,
and a great deale of
folly it is makes him a wise
man. Hee is free from ma|nie
Vices, by being not
grown to the performance,
and is onely more vertu|ous
out of weaknesse. E|uerie
action is his danger,
and euery man his ambush.
Hee is a Shippe without
Pilot or Tackling, and on|ly

good fortune may steere
him. If he scape this age,
hee ha's scap't a Tempest,
and may liue to be a Man.


32. The common singing-men
in Cathedrall
Churches.
ARe a bad Society, and
yet a Company of
good Fellowes, that roare
deep in the Quire, deeper
in the Tauerne. They are
the eight parts of speech
which goe to the Syntaxis
of Seruice, and are distin|guish't
by their noyses
much like Bels, for they

make not a Consort but a
Peale. Their pastime or
recreation is prayers, their
exrecise drinking, yet here|in
so religiously addicted
that they serue God oft|est
when they are drunke.
Their humanity is a legge
to the Residencer, their
learning a Chapter, for
they learne it commonly
before they read it, yet the
old Hebrew names are lit|tle
beholding to them, for
they mis-call them worse
then one another. Though
they neuer expound the
Scripture, they handle it
much, and pollute the Gos|pel
with two things, their
Conuersation, and their

thumbes. Vpon Worky-dayes
they behaue them|selues
at Prayers as at their
Pots, for they swallow
them downe in an instant.
Their Gownes are lac'd
co~monly with streamings
of Ale, the superfluites of
cups, or throat aboue mea|sure.
Their skill in melo|dy
makes them the better
companions abroad, and
their Anthemes abler to
sing Catches. Long-liu'd
for the most part they are
not, especially the base,
they ouer-flow their banke
so oft to drowne the Or|gans.
Briefly, if they escape
arresting, they dye con|stantly
in Gods Seruice;

and to take their death
with more patience, they
haue Wine and Cakes at
their Funerall: and now
they keepe the Church a
great deale better, and
helpe to fill it with their
bones as before with their
noise.


33. A Pretender to
Learning.
IS one that would make
others more fooles then
himselfe; for though hee
know nothing, he would
not haue the world know
so much. He conceits no|thing

in Learning but the
opinion, which he seekes
to purchase without it,
though hee might with
lesse labour cure is igno|rance,
then hide it. He is
indeed a kind of Scholler-Mountebank,
and his Art,
our delusion. He is trickt
out in all the accoutre|ments
of Learning, and at
the first encounter none
passes better. He is oftner
in his study, then at his
Booke, and you cannot
pleasure him better, then
to deprehend him. Yet he
heares you not til the third
knocke, and then comes
out very angry, as inter|rupted.
You find him in

his Slippers, and a Pen in
his eare, in which formali|ty
he was asleep. His Table
is spred wide with some
Classicke Folio, which is as
constant to it as the carpet,
and hath laid open in the
same Page this halfe yeare.
His Candle is alwayes a
longer sitter vp then him|selfe,
and the boast of
his Window at Midnight.
He walkes much alone in
the Posture of Meditati|on,
and ha's a Booke
still before his face in the
fields. His pocket is sel|dome
without a Greeke
Testament, or Hebrew Bi|ble,
which hee opens on|ly
in the Church, and that

when some stander by
lookes ouer. He has his sen|tences
for Company, some
scatterings of Seneca and
Tacitus, which are good
vpon all occasions. If hee
read any thing in the mor|ning,
it comes vp all at
dinner: and as long as that
lasts, the discourse is his.
He is a great Plagiarie of
Tauerne-wit: and comes
to Sermons onely that he
may talke of Austin. His
Parcels are the meere scra|pings
fro~ Company, yet he
complains at parting what
time he has lost. He is won|drously
capricious to seem
a iudgement, and listens
with a soure attention, to

what he vnderstands not:
He talkes much of Scali|ger
and Causabone, and the
Iesuites, and prefers some
vnheard-of Dutch name
before them all. He has ver|ses
to bring in vpon these
and these hints, and it shall
goe hard but he will wind
in his opportunity. He is
criticall in a language hee
cannot conster, and speaks
seldome vnder Armini|us
in Diuinity. His busi|nesse
and retirement and
caller away is his Study,
and he protests no delight
to it comparable. Hee is
a great Nomen-clator of
Authors, which hee has
read in generall in the Ca|talogue,

and in particular
in the Title, and goes sel|dome
so farre as the De|dication.
Hee neuer talkes
of any thing, but learning,
and learnes all from tal|king.
Three incounters
with the same men pumpe
him, and then hee onely
puts in, or grauely sayes no
thing. He has taken paines
to be an Asse, though not
to be a Scholler, and is
at length discouered and
laught at.


34. A Shop-keeper.
HIs Shop is his wel stuft
Booke, and himselfe

the Title-page of it, or In|dex.
Hee vtters much to
all men, though he sels but
to a few, and intreates for
his owne necessities by
asking others what they
lacke. No man speakes
more and no more, for his
words are like his Wares,
twentie of one sort, and he
goes ouer them alike to all
commers. He is an arro|gant
commender of his
owne things; for what|soeuer
hee shewes you, is
the best in the Towne,
though the worst in his
Shop. His Conscience was
a thing, that would haue
layde vpon his hands, and
he was forc't to put it off:

and makes great vse of
honestie to professe vpon.
Hee tels you lyes by rote,
and not minding, as the
Phrase to sell in, and the
Language hee spent most
of his yeeres to learne. He
neuer speakes so truely, as
when hee sayes hee would
vse you as his Brother, for
hee would abuse his Bro|ther;
 in his Shop, thinkes
it lawfull. His Religion is
much in the nature of his
Customers, and indeed the
Pander to it: and by a mis|interpreted
sense of Scrip|ture
makes a gaine of his
Godlinesse. Hee is your
slaue while you pay him
ready Money, but if hee

once be-friend you, your
Tyrant, and you had bet|ter
deserue his hate then
his trust.


35. A handsome
Hostesse.
IS the fairer commenda|tion
of an Inne, aboue
the faire Signe or faire
Lodgings. She is the Load|stone
that attracts men of
Iron, Gallants and Roa|rers,
where they cleaue
sometimes long, and are
not easily got off. Her
Lips are your wel-come,
and your entertainement

her companie, which is put
into the reckoning too, and
is the dearest parcell in it
No Citizens wife is demu|rer
then shee at the first
greeting, nor drawes in her
mouth with a chaster sim|per,
but you may be more
familiar without distaste,
and shee do's not startle
at Baudrie. She is the con|fusion
of a Pottle of Sacke
more then would haue
beene spent els-where, and
her little Iugs are accepted,
to haue her Kisse excuse
them. Shee may be an ho|nest
woman, but is not be|leeu'd
so in her Parish, and
no man is a greater In fidel
in it then her Husband.



36. A Blunt Man.
IS one whose wit is bet|ter
pointed then his be|hauiour,
and that course,
and Impollisht not out of
ignorance so much as hu|mour.
He is a great enemy
to the fine Gentleman, and
these things of Comple|ment,
and hates ceremonie
in conuersation, as the Pu|ritan
in Religion. Hee di|stinguishes
not betwixt
faire and double-dealing,
and suspects all smooth|nesse
for the dresse of kna|uerie.
Hee starts at the en|counter
of a Salutation, as
an assault, and beseeches

you in choller to forbeare
your courtesie. Hee loues
not any thing in Discourse
that comes before the pur|pose,
and is alwaies suspici|ous
of a Preface. Himselfe
fals rudely still on his mat|ter
without any circum|stance,
except hee vse an
old Prouerbe for an Intro|duction.
He sweares olde
out of date innocent othes,
as by the Masse, by our
Ladie, and such like; and
though there bee Lords
present, hee cryes my Ma|sters.
Hee is exceedingly
in loue with his Humour,
which makes him alwayes
professe and proclaime it,
and you must take what he

sayes patiently, because he
is a plaine man. His nature
is his excuse still and other
mens Tyrant for hee must
speake his mind, and that
is his worst, and craues
your perdon most iniuri|ously
for not Pardoning
you. His Iests best become
him, because they come
from him rudely and vnaf|fected:
and hee has the
lucke commonly to haue
them famous. Hee is one
that will doe more then he
will speake, and yet speake
more then hee will heare:
for though hee loue to
touch others, hee is teachy
himselfe, and seldome to
his own abuses replyes but

with his Fists. Hee is as
squeazie of his commenda|tions
as his courtesie, and
his good word is like an E|logie
in a Satyre. Hee is
generally better fauour'd
then hee fauours, as be|ing
commonly well ex|pounded
in his bitternesse,
and no man speaks treason
more securely. Hee chides
great men with most bold|nesse,
and is counted for it
an honest fellow. Hee is
grumbling much in the
behalfe of the Common-wealth,
and is in Prison
oft for it with credit. Hee
is generally honest, but
more generally thought
so, and his downe-right|nesse

credits him, as a man
not wel bended and crook|ned
to the times. In con|clusion,
hee is not easily
bad, in whom this quali|tie
is Nature, but the coun|terfeit
is most dangerous
since he is disguis'd in a hu|mour,
that professes not
to disguise.


37. A Criticke.
IS one that has speld o|uer
a great many of
Bookes, and his obserua|tion
is the Orthographie.
Hee is the Surgeon of old
Authors, and heales the

wounds of dust and igno|rance.
He conuerses much
in fragments and Desunt
multa's, and if he piece it vp
with two Lines, he is more
proud of that Booke then
the Authour. Hee runnes
ouer all Sciences to peruse
their Syntaxis, and thinkes
all Learning compris'd in
writing Latine. Hee tastes
Styles, as some discreeter
Palats doe Wine; and tels
you which is Genuine,
which Sophisticate and ba|stard.
His owne Phrase is
a Miscellanie of old words,
deceas'd long before the
Caesars, and entoomb'd by
Varro, and the modern'st
man hee followes is Plau|tus.

Hee writes Omneis at
length, and quidquid, and
his Gerund is most incon|formable.
Hee is a trou|ble
troublesome vexer of
the dead, which after so
long sparing must rise vp
to the Iudgement of his
castigations. He is one that
makes all Bookes sell dea|rer,
whilst he swels them
into Folio's with his Com|ments.



38. A Sergeant or
Catch-pole.
IS one of Gods Iudge|ment;
and which our
Roarers doe onely con|ceiue
terrible. Hee is the
properest shape wherein
they fancie Satan; for hee
is at most but an Arrester,
and Hell a Dungeon. Hee
is the Creditors Hawke,
wherewith they seaze vp|on
flying Birds, and fetch
them againe in his Tallons.
He is the Period of young
Gentlemen, or their full
stop, for when hee meetes
with them they can goe no
farther. His Ambush is a

Shop-Stall, or close Lane,
and his Assault is coward|ly
at your backe. Hee re|spites
you in no place but
a Tauerne, where hee sels
his Minutes dearer then a
Clocke-maker. The com|mon
way to runne from
him, is through him,
which is often attempted
and atchieued, and no man
is ofter beaten out of Cha|titie.
Hee is one makes the
streete more dangerous
then the High-wayes, and
men goe better prouided
in their walkes then their
Iourney. Hee is the first
handsell of the young Ra|piers
of the Templers, and
they are as proud of his

repulse, as an Hungarian
of killing a Turke. He is a
moueable Prison, and his
hands two Manacles hard
to be fil'd off. He is an occa|sioner
of diloyal thoughts
in the Common-wealth,
for he makes men hate the
Kings Name worse then
the Deuils.


37. A weake Man.
IS one whom Nature
huddled vp in hast, and
left his best part vnfinish't.
The rest of him is growne
to bee a man, onely his
braine stayes behind. Hee

is a man that ha's not im|proou'd
his first rudi|ments,
nor attain'd any
proficiencie by his stay in
the world: but wee may
speake of him yet as when
hee was in the budde a
good harmelesse nature, a
well meaning mind, if hee
could order his intentions.
It is his misery that hee
now most wants a Tutor,
and is too old to haue one.
Hee is two steps aboue a
foole, and a great many mo
below a wise-man: yet the
foole is oft giuen him, and
by those whom he esteems
most. Some tokens of him
are. He loues men better
vpon relation then experi|ence:

for he is exceeding|ly
enamour'd of Strangers,
and none quicklier a weary
of his friend. Hee charges
you at first meeting with
all his secrets, and on bet|ter
acquaintance growes
more reseru'd. Indeed he
is one that mistakes much
his abusers for friends, and
his friends for enemies,
and hee apprehends your
hate in nothing so much,
as in good counsell. One
that is flexible with any
thing but reason, and then
only peruerse;  you may
better intice then perswade
him. A seruant to euery tale
and flatterer,  whom the
last man still works ouer. A

great affecter of wits and
such pretinesses; and his
company is costly to him,
for he seldom ha's it but in|uited.
His friendship com|monly
is begun in a supper
and lost in lending money.
The Tanerne is a dange|rous
place to him, for to
drinke and to be drunke, is
with him all one, and his
braine is sooner quenchd
then his thirst. He is drawn
into naughtines with com|pany,
but suffers alone,
and the Bastard common|ly
laid to his charge. One
that will bee patiently a|bus'd,
and take excepti|ons
a Moneth after when
he vnderstands it, and then

not endeare him more
then by coozening him,
and it is a temptation to
those that would not. One
discouerable in all sillines|ses
to all men but himselfe,
 you may take any mans
knowledge of him better
then his owne. Hee will
promise the same thing to
twentie, and rather then
denie one breake with all.
One that ha's no power
o're himselfe, o're his busi|nesse,
o're his friends: but
a prey and pitie to all: and
if his fortunes once sinke,
men quickly crie alas, and
forget him.



40. A Tobacco-seller.
IS the onely man that
finds good in it which o|thers
brag of, but doe not;
for it is meate, drinke, and
clothes to him. No man o|pens
his ware with greater
seriousnesse, or challenges
your iudgement more in
the approbation. His Shop
is the Randeuous of spit|ting,
where men dialogue
with their noses, and their
communication is smoke.
It is the place onely where
Spaine is commended and
prefer'd before England it
selfe. He should be well ex|perienc'd
in the world: for

he ha's daily tryall of mens
nostrils, and none is bet|ter
acquainted with hu|mors.
Hee is the piecing
commonly of some other
trade, which is bawd to
his Tobacco, and that to
his wife, which is the flame
that followes this smoke.


41. A plausible Man.
IS one that would faine
run an eeuen path in the
world, and iutt against no
man. His endeuour is not
to offend, and his ayme the
generall opinion. His con|uersation
is a kind of con|tinued

Complement, and
his life a practise of man|ners.
The relation hee
beares to others, a kind of
fashionable respect, not
friendship, but friendlines,
which is equall to all and
 and his kindnes|ses
seldome exceed courte|sies.
Hee loues not deep|er
mutualities, because hee
would not take sides, nor
hazard himselfe on dis|pleasures,
which he prin|cipally
auoids. At your
first acquaintance with him
he is exceeding kind and
friendly, and at your twen|tieth
meeting after but
friendly still. He has an ex|cellent
command ouer his

patience and tongue, espe|cially
the last, which hee
accommodates alwayes to
the times and persons, and
speakes seldome what is
sincere, but what is ciuill.
He is one that vses al com|panies,
drinkes all healths,
and is reasonable coole in
all Religions. He can listen
to a foolish discourse with
an applausiue attention,
and conceale his Laughter
at Non-sense. Silly men
much honour and esteeme
him, because by his faire
reasoning with them as
with men of vnderstan|ding,
he puts them into an
erroneous opinion of them
selues, and makes them

forwarder heereafter to
their owne discouerie. He
is one rather well thought
on then belou'd, and that
loue hee ha's is more of
whole companies together
then any one in particular.
Men gratifie him notwith|standing
with a good re|port,
and what euer vi|ces
he ha's besides, yet ha|uing
no enemies, he is sure
to be an honest fellow.



42. The Worlds wise
Man.
IS an able and suffici|ent
wicked man, it is a
proofe of his sufficiency
that hee is not called wic|ked,
but wise. A man wholy
determin'd in himselfe and
his owne ends, and his in|struments
herein any thing
that will doe it. His friends
are a part of his engines,
and as they serue this
worke, vs'd or laid by. In|deed
hee knowes not this
thing of friend, but if hee
giue you the name, it is a
signe he ha's a plot on you.
Neuer more actiue in his

businesses, then when they
are mixt with some harme
to others: and tis his best
play in this Game to strike
off and lie in the place. Suc|sessfull
commonly in these
vndertakings, because he
passes smoothly those rubs
which others stumble at,
as Conscience and the
like: and gratulates him|selfe
much in this aduan|tage:
Oathes and falshood
he counts the neerest way,
and loues not by any
meanes to goe about. Hee
has many fine quips at this
folly of plaine dealing, but
his tush is greatest at Reli|gion,
yet hee vses this
too, and Vertue, and good

Words, but is lesse dange|rously
a Diuel then a Saint.
He ascribes all honestie to
an vnpractis'dnesse in the
World: and Conscience a
thing meerely for Chil|dren.
Hee scornes all that
are so silly to trust him, and
onely not scornes his ene|mie;
especially if as bad as
himselfe: He feares him as
a man well arm'd, and pro|uided,
but sets boldly on
good natures, as the most
vanquishable. One that se|riously
admires those worst
Princes, as Sforza, Borgia,
and Richard the Third: and
cals matters of deepe villa|ny
things of difficultie. To
whom murders are but re|solute

Acts, and Treason a
businesse of great conse|quence.
One whom two
or three Countries make
vp to this compleatnesse,
and he ha's traueld for the
purpose. His deepest in|dearment
is a communica|tion
of mischiefe, and then
onely you haue him fast.
His conclusion is com|monly
one of these two,
either a Great Man, or
hang'd.



43. A Bowle Alley.
IS the place where there
are three things throwne
away beside Bowls, to wit,
time, money and curses,
and the last ten for one.
The best Sport in it is the
Gamesters, and he enioyes
it that lookes on and bets
not. It is the Schoole of
wrangling, and worse then
the Schooles, for men will
cauill heere for an haires
breadth, and make a stirre
where a straw would end
the controuersie. No An|ticke,
screwes mens bodies
into such strange flexures,
and you would think them

senslesse, to speak sense to
to their Bowle, and put
their trust in intreaties for a
good cast. The Betters are
the factious noise of the Al|ley,
or the gamesters beads|men
that pray for them.
They are somewhat like
those that are cheated by
great Men, for they lose
their mony  must say no|thing.
It is the best discoue|ry
of humors, especially in
the losers, where you haue
fine variety of impatience,
whilst some fret, some raile,
some sweare, and others
more ridiculously comfort
themselues with Philoso|phy.
To giue you the Mo|rall
of it; It is the Emleme

of the world, or the worlds
ambition: where most are
short, or ouer, or wide or
wrong-Byas'r, and some
few iustle in to the Mistris
Fortune. And it is here as
in the Court, where the
nearest are most spighted,
and all blowes aym'd at
the Toucher.


44. A Surgeon.
IS one that has some bu|sinesse
about his Buil|ding
or little house of man,
whereof Nature is as it
were the Tyler, and hee
the Playsterer. It is ofter

out of reparations, then an
old Parsonage, and then
he is set on worke to patch
it againe. Hee deales most
with broken Commodi|ties,
as a broken Head, or
a mangled face, and his
gaines are very ill got, for
he liues by the hurts of the
Common-wealth. He dif|fers
from a Physitian as a
sore do's from a disease, or
the sicke from those that
are not whole, the one dis|tempers
you within, the
other blisters you without.
He complaines of the de|cay
of Valour in these
daies, and sighes for that
slashing Age of Sword and
Buckler; and thinkes the

Law against Duels, was
made meerly to wound his
Vocation. Hee had beene
long since vndone, if the
charitie of the Stewes had
not relieued him, from
whom he ha's his Tribute
as duely as the Pope, or a
wind-fall sometimes from
a Tauerne, if a quart Pot
hit right. The rarenesse of
his custome maks him pit|tilesse
when it comes: and
he holds a Patient longer
then our Courts a Cause.
Hee tels you what danger
you had beene in if he had
staide but a minute longer,
and though it bee but a
prickt finger, hee makes of
it much matter. He is a rea|reasonable

cleanely man,
considering the Scabs hee
ha's to deale with,  your
finest Ladies now and then
are beholding to him for
their best dressings. Hee
curses old Gentlewomen,
and their charity that maks
his Trade their Almes: but
his enuie is neuer stir'd so
much as when Gentlemen
goe ouer to sight vpon Ca|lice
Sands, whome hee
wishes drown'd ere they
come there, rather then the
French shall get his Cu|stome.



45. A Shee-precise.
Hypocrite.
IS one in whom good
Women suffer, and haue
their truth mis-interpreted
by her folly.
She is one, she knows not
what her selfe if you aske
her, but shee is indeed one
that ha's taken a toy at the
fashion of Religion, and is
enamour'd of the New|fangle.
See is a Non|conformist
in a close Sto|macher
and Ruffe of Ge|neua
Print, and her puritie
consists much in her Lin|nen.
Shee ha's heard of the
Rag of Rome, and thinkes

it a very sluttish Religion,
and rayles at the Whore
of Babylon for a very
naughty Woman. Shee
ha's left her Virginity as a
Relique of Popery, and
marries in her Tribe with|out
a Ring. Her deuotion
at the Church is much in
the turning vp of her eye,
and turning downe the
lease in her Booke when
shee heares nam'd Chap|ter
and Verse. When she
comes home, shee com|mends
the Sermon for the
Scripture, and two houres.
She loues Preaching bet|ter
then Praying, and of
Preachers Lecturers, and
thinkes the Weeke-dayes

Exercise farre more edify|ing
then the Sundaies. Her
oftest Gossippings are Sa|baoth-dayes
iourneyes,
where (though an ene|my
to Superstition) shee
will goe in Pilgrimage fiue
mile to a silenc'd Mini|ster,
when there is a bet|ter
Sermon in her owne
Parish. Shee doubts of
the Virgin Marie's Salua|tion,
and dare not Saint
her, but knowes her own
place in heauen as per|fectly,
as the Pew shee
ha's a key to. Shee is so
taken vp with Faith, shee
ha's no roome for Chari|ty,
and vnderstands no
good Workes, but what

are wrought on the Sam|pler.
She accounts no|thing
Vices but Supersti|tion,
and an Oath, and
thinkes Adultery a lesse
sinne, then to sweare by
my Truely. Shee rayles
at other Women by the
names of Iezabel and Da|lilah:
and calls her owne
daughters Rebecka and A|bigail,
and not Anne but
Hannah. She suffers them
not to learne on the Virgi|nalls,
because of their affi|nity
with the Organs, but
is reconcil'd to the Bells
for the Chymes sake, since
they were reform'd to the
tune of a Psalme. She ouer
flowes so with the Bible,

that she spils it vpon euery
occasion, and wil not Cud|gell
her Maides without
Scripture. It is a question
whether shee is more trou|bled
with the Diuell or the
Diuell with her: shee is al|wayes
challenging and da|ring
him, and her weapons
are Spels no lesse potent
then different, as being the
sage Sentences of some of
her owne Sectaries. No
thing angers her so much
as that Woemen cannot
Preach, and in this point
onely thinkes the Brownist
erroneous: but what shee
cannot at the Church, shee
do's at the Table, where
she prattles more then any

against sense, and Anti|christ,
till a Capon wing
silence her. Shee expounds
the Priests of Baal Reading
Ministers, and thinkes the
Saluation of that Parish as
desperate as the Turkes.
Shee is a maine derider to
her capacitie of those that
are not her Preachers, and
censures all Sermons but
bad ones. If her Husband
be a Tradsman, shee helpes
him to Customers, how so|euer
to good cheere, and
they are a most faithfull
couple at these meetings,
for they neuer faile. Her
Conscience is like others
Lust neuer satisfied, and
you might better answere

Scotus then her Scruples.
Shee is one that thinkes
shee performes all her du|ty
to God in hearing, and
shewes the fruits of it in
talking. Shee is more fiery
against the May-pole then
her Husband, and thinkes
he might doe a Phinehas
his act to break the pate of
the Fiddler. She is an euer|lasting
Argument; but I
am weary of her.



46. A Contemplatiue
Man.
IS a Scholler in this great
Vniuersity the World;
and the same his Booke
and Study. Hee cloysters
not his Meditations in
the narrow darknesse of a
Roome, but sends them
abroad with his Eyes, and
his Braine trauels with his
Feete. He looks vpon Man
from a high Tower, and
sees him trulyer at this
distance in his Infirmities
and poorenesse. He scornes
to mixe himselfe in mens a|ctions;
as he would to act
vpon a Stage; but sits a|loft

on the Scaffold a cen|suring
Spectator. Nature
admits him as a partaker
of her Sports, and asks his
approbation as it were of
her owne Workes, and va|riety.
Hee comes not in
Company, because hee
would not be solitary, but
findes Discourse enough
with himselfe, and his
owne thoughts are his ex|cellent
play-fellowes. He
lookes not vpon a thing as
a yawning Stranger at no|uelties;
but his search is
more mysterious and in|ward,
and hee spels Hea|uen
out of earth. He knits
his obseruations together,
and makes a Ladder of

them all to climbe to
God. He is free from vice,
because he has no occasion
to imploy it, and is aboue
those ends that make men
wicked. He ha's learnt all
can heere be taught him,
and comes now to Hea|uen
to see more.


47. An Aturney.
HIs Ancient beginning
was a blue coat, since
a liuery, and his hatching
vnder a Lawer; whence
though but pen-feather'd,
hee hath now nested for
himselfe, and with his hor|ded

pence purchast an Of|fice.
Two Deskes, and a
quire of Pader set him vp,
where he now sits in state
for all commers. We can-call
him no great Anthor,
yet he writes very much,
and with the infamy of
the Court is maintain'd in
his libels. Hee ha's some
smatch of a Scholler, and
yet vses Latine very hard|ly,
and let it should accuse
him, cuts it off in the midst,
and will not let it speake,
out. He is contrary to great
men, maintained by his
followers, that is his poore
country Clients, that wor|ship
him more then their
Landlord, and be there ne|uer

such churles, he lookes
for their curtesie. He first
racks them soundly him|selfe,
and then deliuers
them to the Lawier for ex|ecution.
His looks are very
solicitous importing much
hast and dispatch, he is ne|uer
without his hanfull
of businesse, that is, of pa|per.
His skin becomes at
last as dry as his parch|ment
and his face as intri|cate
as the most winding
cause. He talkes Statutes as
fiercely, as if he had moo|ted
seuen yeers in the Inns
of Court; when all his skill
is stucke in his girdle, or
in his office window. Strife
and wrangling haue made

him rich, and he is thank|full
to his benefactor, and
nourishes it. If he liue in a
Country village, he makes
all his neighbours good
Subiects; for there shall
be nothing done but what
there is law for. His bu|sinesse
giues him not leaue
to thinke of his consci|ence,
and when the time,
or terme of his life is go|ing
out, for Doomes-day
he is secure; for he hopes
he has a tricke to reuerse
iudgement.



48. A Scepticke in
Religion.
IS one that hangs in the
ballance with all sorts of
opinions, whereof not one
but stirres him and none
swayes him. A man guilti|er
of credulity then he is ta|ken
to bee; for it is out
of his beleefe of euery
thing, that hee fully be|leeues
nothing. Each Re|ligion
scarres him from
it's contrary: none per|swades
him to it selfe. Hee
would be wholy a Chri|stian,
but that he is some|thing
of an Atheist, and
wholy an Atheist, but that

hee is partly a Christian;
and a perfect Heretick, but
that there are so many to
distract him. He finds rea|son
in all opinions, truth in
none: indeed the least rea|son
perplexes him, and the
best will not satisfie him.
He is at most a confus'd
and wild Christian, not
specializ'd, by any forme,
but capable of all. He vses
the Lands Religion, be|cause
it is next him, yet he
sees not why hee may not
take the other, but he chu|ses
his, not as better, but
because there is not a pin
to choose. He finds doubts
and sernples better then
resolues them, and is al|wayes

too hard for him|selfe.
His Learning is too
much for his brayne; and
his iudgment too little for
his learning, and his ouer|opinion
of both spoyls all
Pity it was his mischance
of being a Scholler; for it
do's only distract and irre|gulate
him  the world by
him. He hammers much in
generall vpon our opini|ons
vncertainety, and the
possibility of erring makes
him not venture on what is
true. He is troubled at this
naturalnesse of Religion to
Countries, that Protestan|tisme
should bee borne so
in England and Popery a|broad,
and that fortune

and the Starres should so
much share in it. He likes
not this connexion of the
Common-weale, and Di|uinity,
and feares it may be
an Arch-practice of State.
In our differences with
Rome he is strangely vn|fix't,
and a new man euery
new day, as his last dis|course-books
Meditations
transport him. Hee could
like the gray haires of Po|perie,
did not some dota|ges
there stagger him; hee
would come to vs sooner,
but our new name affrights
him. He is taken with their
Miracles but doubts an im|posture;
hee conceiues of
our Doctrine better; but it

seemes too empty and na|ked.
He cannot driue into
his fancy the circumscrip|tion
of Truth to our cor|ner,
and is as hardly per|swaded
to thinke their old
Legends true. He approues
wel of our Faith, and more
of their workes, and is
sometimes much affected
at the zeale of Amsterdam.
His conscience interposes
it selfe betwixt Duellers,
and whillst it would part
both, is by both wounded.
He will somtimes propend
much to vs vpon the rea|ding
a good Writer, and
at Bellarmine recoyles as
farre backe againe; and
the Fathers iustle him

from one side to another
Now Sosinaas and Vorstius
afrsh torture him, and he
agrees with none worse
then himselfe. He puts his
foot into Heresies tenderly
as a Cat in the water, and
pulls it out againe, and
still something vnanswer'd
delayes him yet he beares
away some parcell of each,
and you may sooner picke
all Religions out of him
then one, He cannot thinke
so many wise men should
be in error, nor so many
honest men out of the way
and his wounder is du|bled,
when he sees these
oppose one annother. He
hates authority as the Ty|rant

of reason, and you
cannot anger him worse
then with a Fathers dixit,
and yet that many are not
perswaded with reason,
shall authorize his doubt.
In summe, his whole life is
a question, and his saluati|on
a greater, which death
onely concludes, and then
he is resolu'd.


47. A Partiall Man.
IS the opposite extreame
to a Defamer, for the
one speakes ill falsly, and
the other well, and both
slander the Truth. He is

one that is still weighing
men in the Scale of Com|parisons,
and puts his af|fection
in the one ballance,
and that swayes. His friend
alwayes shall doe best, and
you shall rarely heare good
of his enemy. Hee con|siders
first the man, and
then the thing, and re|straines
all merit to what
they deserue of him. Com|mendations
hee esteemes
not the debt of Worth,
but the requitall of kind|nesse:
and if you aske his
reason, shewes his Interest,
and tels you how much he
is beholding to that Man.
Hee is one that ties his
iudgement to the Wheele

of Fortune, and they de|termine
giddily both a|like.
He preferres England
before other Countries, be|cause
he was borne there,
and Oxford before other
Vniuersities, because hee
was brought vp there, and
the best Scholler there, is
one of his owne Colledge
and the best Schooler there
is one of his friends. Hee
is a great fauourer of great
persons, and his argument
is still that which should
bee Antecedent, as he is in
high place, therefore ver|tuous,
he is prefer'd, there|fore
worthy. Neuer aske
his opinion, for you shall
heare but his faction, and

he is indifferent in nothing
but Conscience. Men e|steeme
him for this a zea|lous
affectionate, but they
mistake him many times,
for hee does it but to bee e|steemed
so. Of all men hee
is worst to write an Histo|rie,
for hee will praise a
Seianus or Tiberius, and
for some pettie respect of
his all posteritie shall bee
cosen'd.



50. A Trumpeter.
IS the Elephant with the
great Trunke, for hee
eates nothing but what
comes through this way.
His Profession is not so
worthy as to occasion in|solence,
and yet no man so
much puft vp. His face is as
Brazen as his Trumpet,
and (which is worse) as a
Fidlers, from whom hee
differeth onely in this, that
his impudence is dearer.
The Sea of Drinke, and
much wind make a Storme
perpetually in his Cheeks,
and his looke is like his
noyse, blustering and tem|pestuous.

Hee wa's whi|lome
the sound of Warre,
but now of Peace; yet as
terrible as euer, for where|soere
hee comes they are
sure to pay for't. He is the
common attendant of glit|tering
folkes, whether in
the Court or Stage, where
he is alwaies the Prologues
Prologue. He is somewhat
in the nature of a Hogshed
shrillest when he is empty;
when his belly is full hee
is quiet enough. No man
proues life more to bee a
blast, or himselfe a bubble,
and he is like a counter|feit
Bankrupt, thriues best
when he is blowne vp.



50. A vulgar-spirited
Man.
IS one of the heard of
World. One that fol|lowes
meerely the com|mon
crye, and makes it
louder by one. A man that
loues none but who are
publikely affected, and he
will not be wiser then the
rest of the Towne. That
neuer ownes a friend after
an ill name, or some gene|rall
imputation though he
knowes it most vnworthy.
That opposes to reason,
Thus men say, and thus
most doe, and thus the
world goes, and thinkes

this enough to poyse the
other. That worships men
in place, and those onely,
and thinkes all a great man
speakes Oracles. Much ta|ken
with my Lords Ist,
and repeats you it all to a
sillable. One that iustifies
nothing out of fashion, nor
any opinion out of the ap|plauded
way. That thinkes
certainly all Spaniards and
Iesuites very villaines, and
is still cursing the Pope
and Spynola. One that
thinkes the grauest Cas|socke
the best Scholler:
and the best Clothes the fi|nest
man. That is taken
onely with broad and ob|scoene
wit, and hisses any

thing too deepe for him.
That cries Chaucer for his
Money aboue all our En|glish
Poets, because the
voice ha's gone so, and hee
ha's read none. That is
much rauisht with such
a Noble-mans courtesie,
and would venture his life
for him, because he put off
his Hat. One that is for|most
still to kisse the Kings
hand, and cries God blesse
his Maiestie loudest. That
rayles on all men con|demn'd
and out of fa|uour,
and the first that
sayes away with the Tray|tors:
yet struck with much
ruth at Executions, and
for pittie to see a man die,

could kill the Hang-man.
That comes to London
to see it, and the pret|ty
things in it, and the
chiefe cause of his iour|ney
the Beares: That
measures the happinesse
of the Kingdome, by the
cheapnesse of corne; and
conceiues no harme of
State, but il trading. With|in
this compasse too, come
those that are too much
wedg'd into the world, and
haue no lifting thoughts
aboue those things that
call to thriue, to doe well,
and Preferment onely the
grace of God. That ayme
all Studies at this marke,
 shew you poore Schol|lers

as an example to take
heed by. That thinke the
Prison and want, a Iudge|ment
for some sin, and ne|uer
like well hereafter of
a Iayle-bird. That know
no other Content but
wealth, brauery, and the
Towne-Pleasures; that
thinke all else but idle spe|culation,
and the Philoso|phers,
mad-men: In short,
men that are carried a|way
with all outwardnes|ses,
shews, appearances, the
streame, the people; for
there is no man of worth
but has a piece of singu|larity,
and scornes some|thing.



32. A Herald.
IS the spawne, or in|deed
but the resultancie
of Nobility, and to the
making of him went not a
Generation, but a Genea|logie.
His Trade is Ho|nour,
and hee sells it,
and giues Armes himselfe,
though hee be no Gen|tleman.
His bribes are
like those of a corrupt
Iudge, for they are the
prices of blood. He seemes
very rich in discourse, for
he tels you of whole fields
of gold and siluer, Or
 Argent, worth much in
French, but in English no|thing.

He is a great diuer
in the streames or issues of
Gentrie, and not a by-Channell
of bastard es|capes
him, yet he dos with
them like some shamelesse
Queane, fathers more chil|dren
on them, then euer
they begot. His Trafficks
is a kind of Pedlery ware,
Scutchions, and Pennons
and little Daggers, and Ly|ons,
such as Children e|steeme
and Gentlemen:
but his peni-worths are
rampant, for you may buy
three whole Brawns chea|per,
then three Boars heads
of him painted. Hee was
somtimes the terrible Coat
of Mars, but is now for

more mercifull Battels in
the Tilt-yard, where who|soeuer
is victorious, the
spoiles are his. Hee is an
Art in England, but in
Wales Nature, where they
are borne with Heraldry
in their mouthes, and each
Name is a Pedegree.


52. A Plodding
Student.
IS a kind of Alchymist or,
Persecurer of Nature,
that would change the dull
lead of his Brain into finer
mettle with successe, many
times as vnprosperous, or

at least not quitting the
cost, to wit, of his owne
Oyle and Candles. He ha's
a strange forc't appetite to
Learning, and to atchieue
it brings nothing but pa|tience
and a body. His Stu|die
is not great but conti|nuall,
and consists much in
the sitting vp till after Mid|night
in a Rug-gowne, and
a Night-cap to the vanqui|shing
perhaps of some sixe
lines: yet what hee ha's, he
ha's perfect, for he reads it
so long to vnderstand it, till
he gets it without Booke.
Hee may with much indu|stry
make a breach into
Logicke, and ariue at some
ability in an Argument:

but for politer Studies hee
dare not skirmish with
them, and for Poetry ac|counts
it impregnable. His
Inuention is no more then
the finding out of his Pa|pers,
and his few gleanings
there, and his disposition of
them is as iust as the Book-binders,
a setting or glew|ing
of them together. Hee
is a great discomforter of
young Students, by telling
them what trauell it ha's
cost him, and how often
his braine turn'd at Philo|sophy,
and makes others
feare Studying as a cause of
Duncery. Hee is a man
much giuen to Apothegms
which serue him for wit,

and seldome breakes any
Iest, but which belong'd
to some Lacedemonian or
Romane in Lycosthenes. He
is like a dull Cariers horse,
that will go a whole weeke
together but neuer out of
a foot-pace: and hee that
sets forth on the Saturday
shall ouertake him.


53. Pauls Walke.
IS the Lands Epitome,
or you may call it the les|ser
Ile of Great Brittaine.
It is more then this, the
whole worlds Map, which
you may here discerne in

it's perfect'st motion iust|ling
and turning. It is a
heape of stones and men,
with a vast confusion of
Languages, and were the
Steeple not sanctifyed no|thing
liker Babel. The
noyse in it is like that of
Bees, a strange humming
or buzze, mixt of walking,
tongues, and feet: It is a
kind of still roare or loud
whisper. It is the great Ex|change
of all discourse, 
no busines whatsoeuer but
is here stirring and a foot.
It is the Synod of all pates
politicke, ioynted and laid
together in most serious
posture, and they are not
halfe so busie at the Par|liament.

It is the Anticke
of tailes to tailes, and
backes to backes, and for
vizards you need goe no
further then faces. It is the
Market of young Lectu|rers,
whom you may chea|pen
here at all rates and si|zes.
It is the generall Mint
of all famous lies, which are
here like the legends of Po|pery,
first coyn'd  stampt
in the Church. All inuen|tions
are emptyed here,
and not few pockets. The
best signe of a Temple in
it is, that it is the Theeues
Sanctuary, which robbe
more safely in the Croud,
then a wildernesse, whilst
euery searcher is a bush to

hide them. It is the other
expence of the day, after
Playes, Tauerne, and a
Baudy-House, and men
haue still some Oathes left
to sweare here. It is the
eares Brothell, and satis|fies
their lust, and ytch.
The Visitants are all men
without exceptions, but
the principall Inhabitants
and possessors, are stale
Knights, and Captaines
out of Seruice, men of
long Rapiers, and Bree|ches,
which after all turne
Merchants here, and traf|ficke
for Newes. Some
make it a Preface to their
Dinner, and Trauell for a
Stomacke: but thriftier

men make it their Ordina|rie:
and Boord here verie
cheape. Of all such places
it is least haunted with
Hobgoblins, for if a Ghost
would walke more, hee
could not.


54. A Vniuersitie
Dunne.
IS a Gentlemans follow|er
cheaply purchas'd, for
his own money ha's hyred
him. Hee is an inferiour
Creditour of some ten shil|lings
or downwards, con|tracted
for Horse-hire, or
perchance for drinke, to

weake to bee put in Suite.
and he arrests your mode|sty.
Hee is now very ex|pensiue
of his time, for
hee will waite vpon your
Staires a whole After|noone,
and dance atten|dance
with more patience
then a Gentleman-Vsher.
Hee is a sore beleaguerer
of Chambers, and assaults
them sometimes with fu|rious
knockes: yet finds
strong resistance common|ly,
and is kept out. Hee
is a great complayner of
Schollers loytering, for
hee is sure neuer to find
them within, and yet hee
is the chiefe cause many
times that makes them

studie. He Grumbles at the
in Gratitude of men, that
shunne him for his kind|nesse,
but indeed it is his
owne fault, for hee is too
great an vpbrayder. No
man put them more to
their braine then hee: and
by shifting him off they
learne to shift in the world.
Some choose their roomes
a purpose to auoide his sur|prizals,
and thinke the best
commoditie in them his
Prospect. Hee is like a reie|cted
acquaintance, hunts
those that care not for
his company, and hee
knowes it well enough;
and yet will not keepe a|way.
The sole place to

supply him is the But|terie,
where hee takes
grieuous vse vpon your
Name, and hee is one
much wrought with good
Beere and Rhetoricke. He
is a man of most vnfor|tunate
voyages, and no
Gallant walkes the streets
to lesse purpose.


55. A stayed Man.
IS a man. One that ha's
taken order with him|selfe,
and set a rule to those
lawlesnesses within him.
Whose life is distinct and
in Method, and his Acti|ons

as it were cast vp be|fore.
Not loos'd into the
Worlds vanities, but ga|thered
vp and contracted
in his station. Not scatter'd
into many pieces of busi|nesses,
but that one course
he takes, goes thorough
with. A man firme and
standing in his purposes,
nor heau'd off with each
wind and passion. That
squares his expence to his
Coffers, and makes the
Totall first, and then the
Items. One that thinkes
what hee does, and does
what he sayes, and forsees
what he may doe, before
he purposes. One whose
(if I can) is more then

anothers assurance, and
his doubtfull tale before
some mens protestations.
That is confident of no|thing
in futurity, yet his
coniectures oft true Pro|phecies.
That makes a
pause still betwixt his are
and beleefe, and is not too
hasty to say after others:
One whose Tongue is
strung vp like a Clocke till
the time, and then strikes,
and sayes much when hee
talkes little. That can see
the Truth betwixt two
wranglers, and sees them
agree euen in that they fall
out vpon. That speakes no
Rebellion in a brauery, or
talkes bigge from the spi|rit

of Sacke. A man coole
and temperate in his passi|ons,
not easily betraid by
his choller: That vies not
oath with oath, nor heat
with heat: but replies calm|ly
to an angry man, and is
too hard for him too. That
can come fairely off from
Captaines companies, and
neither drink nor quarrell.
One whom no ill hunting
fends home discontented,
and makes him sweare at
his dogs and family. One
not hasty to pursue the
new Fashion, nor yet affe|ctedly
true to his old round
Breeches. But grauely
handsome,  to his place,
which suites him better

then his Tailor. Actiue in
the world without disqui|et,
and carefull without
miserie: yet neither ingu
in his pleasures, nor a see|ker
of businesse, but ha's
his houres for both. A man
that seldome laughes vio|lently,
but his mirth is a
cheerefull looke. Of a com|pos'd
end setled counte|nance,
not set, nor much
alterable with sadnesse or
ioy. He affects nothing so
wholy, that hee must bee a
miserable man when he lo|ses
it: but forethinks what
will come hereafter, and
spares Fortune his thanks
and curses. One that loues
his Credit, not this word

Reputation; yet can saue
both without a Duell:
whose entertainments to
greater men are respectfull
not complementary, and
to his friends plaine not
rude. A good Husband,
Father, Master: that is
without doting, pampring,
familiarity. A man well
poys'd in all humours, in
whom Nature shwed most
Geometry, and hee ha's
not spoyl'd the worke. A
man of more wisedome
then wittinesse, and braine
then fancy; and abler to
any thing then to make
Verses.
FINIS.
