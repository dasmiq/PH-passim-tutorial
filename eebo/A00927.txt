TO THE
GREAT EXAMPLE
of Vertue and Nobility,
the Lady Katherine
Abergauenny.
_MADAME,
THIS small
POEME, (a late
Birth of myne, and
so meanly clad, as
poore Art it selfe is euen asham'd of
it) I should scarce haue ventured to
present vnto your Ladishippe, had I

not more then hop't, that the Excel|lency
of the Subiect, would (in
your iust Esteeme) haue kept at
least in equall Ballance, my wants
in writing it.
I am to professe (Madame)
so many extraordinary fauours, by
which your vnwearyed Goodnes
hath euer pleas'd (aboue my deserts)
to honour me, as I am forc't to seeke
out some more then ordinary way, to
shew my selfe in Will, theyr grate|full
debtour, in Ability I cannot
hope. Therefore Madame, remay|ning
still your debtour in the Prin|cipall,
all I am able, and intend to
do, is to call as many others as I can,
into the Interest of the Debt with
me; by letting all know (who from

the reading of this little VVorke,
may receaue eyther Profit or De|light,
that they owe it wholly to
your Ladyship.
By this means perceauing, that I
was like to draw your Name, as
Party, into the Reputation of this
VVorke, I thought it would best be|come
my Care, as it did my Duty,
(who otherwise as you will see, haue
affected nothing in the writing it)
so to prouide, as none might receaue
offence, or harme by reading it. Of
which happines (though somewhat
rare in these Tymes, and more in
such Workes) being secure in its
Innocency, and my Well-Mea|ning
it, it dares with the more
Confidence, and cheerfulnes ap|proach

vnto your Ladyshippe, to
leaue in your fayre Hands, a perpe|tuall
testimony of his Respect, and
Duty, whome your Great Ver|tues,
 many Deserts haue wonne
to be
Theyr euer Seruant,
 Faithfull Ho|nourer.
Rich. Flecknoe.





The First Canto.

ARGVMENT.
The Bridegroomes State,
And grace, in setting forth,
His Courtiers order,
And his Mothers worth.



1.
MID-night silence, all be dumbe,
Rise,  see the Bridgroome come.
But beware that none come neare,
Only those, whose breasts are cleare
From all crime, or sinne, so foule,
That may wound, or kill the soule.
These are Mysteries, and Rites
To be seene by chaster Sights,
To be mark't, and vnderstood
Only by the pure, and good,
Vertue, (as t'is most agreeing)
Only's fit for Vertu's seeing.



2.
Looke, the Heauens transparent gate
Open's wide, and out there at
First a flight of Angells come,
Some do play, and other some
With the flickr'ing of theyr wings
Keep the time, whilst others sings.
Others strew the way with flowr's
Gather'd fresh from Eden's bowr's
Such for sight,  curious smell,
As they knew would most excell,
All in gen'rall, Ioy do share,
To themselues, peculiar care.



3.
Those the Ancient Prophet's were,
who that wondrous Banner beare,
Whose true Colour none can know:
They appeare the lesse in show,
'Cause about theyr heads there flyes,
Such a cloud of Mysteries,
As vnto our Sense they leaue
Scarcely ought we may perceaue.
But those soul's to whome ti's giuen
For to know them all in Heauen,
There are few, or none, do say,
Make a fayrer shew then they.



4.
Those more open to our sight,
Next in ranke, with Garments bright,
Whose deare Pouerty doth waue,
In that Ensigne which they haue,
(Glose of which will neuer fade
Though in water-colours layd,)
Were Apostles. Those are they
Who from fishing in the Sea,
Came to take more soul's on Land
Then the shoars haue graynes of sand,
With no other Netts, or Hookes
Then theyr Tongues, and holy Bookes.



5.
Those who fayre Vermilion beare
With greene Laurell, Martyrs were,
Marke how through their shining red,
Bee't in body, heart, or head,
All the Wounds were giu'n them heere,
Brighter then the Sunne appeere.
Soares, are chang'd to pretious Gemmes,
Grieuous stripes, to glorious beames,
Drops of bloud, to Rubyes red,
Scarres, to Crownes vpon theyr head,
Teares, to Pearles, and euery payne
Hath it's proper Ioy, and gayne.



6.
Those whose Colours fayrely spred
Shew pure white, bestreak't with red,
Were Confessours, such as heere
Arm'd by Vertue agaynst Feare,
Durst confesse theyr Fayth, in time
When t'was thought the greatest crime,
These are they, who did reduce
Thousand soules, from sinnes abuse:
Who Hells gates (in manner) brake
With the force of Truth they spake:
For the which theyr tongues now shine.
(As you see) with light diuine.



7.
Those that next do take your eye,
Are the Glory's of the sky,
Whose white Streamers do declare,
That they euer Virgins were.
In whose sight, is vnderstood
All that's perfect, rare, and good.
Look's as simple, as the Doues,
Fayre, as twenty thousand Loues,
Sweeter, then the breath of May,
Fresher, then the new borne Day,
With theyr Vertue yet, compare
All these parts, they nothing are.



8.
But in mid'st of these doth come
Graces, and Perfections summe.
Queen of Heauen,  Mother deare
To the Glorious Bridegroome there,
As the Rose, the Three-leau'd grasse
Both for sweet,  fayre, doth passe,
As the Day out-shines the Nights,
As the Moone the lesser lights:
Blessed She, so farre, and more,
Passes all that went before.
At whose prayse no Angells tounge
Offer's, but it must do wrong.



9.
But now marke, how all thing cheers,
When the Bridgroome first appeers;
How his Face doth glory's flame.
Know you whence theyr brightnes came?
In cold mornings we perceaue
Words, behind a mist to leaue:
So ech word, which He doth say,
Turn's into a sunne-shine ray:
Which besid's we may presume,
Vapours all this rare perfume,
That doth make the gentle ayre
Amber-sweet, as Ro-sy fayre.



10.
Purple is his marriage weed,
Which the star's, do thicker seed
Then a frosty winters night,
When the Moone shines fayre  bright.
Phosphorus like a pretious stone,
ast before, doth keep it on,
And behind it loosly flow's,
Proud at euery step he go's
For to kisse his Blessed feet;
Whence it doth returne more sweet,
hen the flowers which May conceyu's
om the ayre that Zeph'rus breaths.



11.
That tongue were of God-like worth
Which could euery grace set forth,
And whoeuer pen them will,
Doth deserue an Angells quill,
And for Inke, were only good,
Virgins teares, and Martyrs bloud,
Mixt with sinners contrite galls,
For theyr much repented falls,
Written on the Milky Way;
All we write, and all we say,
All we comprehend by sence,
Reacheth not his Excellence.



12.
Virgins hence, and close your eyes,
Least his Loue your myndes surprise:
Th' are to tender, He to fayre,
Euery Looke will be a snare,
For to take the waryest heart:
Therfore go, in time depart.
Y'aue inough already spyed,
To be enuious of the Bride.
Yet stay, wretch what haue I done?
T'is his will that all should come.
Stay, harke, He himselfe doth call,
He hath Loue inough for all.



13.
Neyther feare her Iealousy,
She doth loue, as well as he,
That you freely looke vpon him.
Till y'ar all enamour'd on him,
Feed your eyes, and take in flame,
Keep your blushes, hide your shame,
It becomes those Virgins most,
Who the ardent'st loue, can boast
Vnto him, who all loue merits,
And all Virgins loue inherits,
Feare not, ioyne you by his side,
And with vs, go see the Bride.



The Allegory.
IN the great Procession of the Celestiall Court
is vnderstood, the Generall Ioye, of all the
Saints in Heaue~, when any one on Earth is fou~d
worthy to receaue theyr maker in the most B. Sa|crament.
The Bridegroomes attyre is purple,
for to signify, that ioyntly with the Ioy of the re|ceauing
him, we are to call to mynd the bitternes
of his passion. That it is adorn'd with starres, is to
shew, that the reward of sufferance on Earth, is
Glory in Heauen. Phosphorus, or the mor|ning
starre, on his Garment before, declares, that
his presence in comming, brings light vnto our
soules, and that we should take his Grace betimes
when it first appeares, since when it is once past,
we may expect it's returne, but cannot call it
backe.




The Second Canto.

ARGVMENT.
The Brides Attyre,
Her meeting with her Louer,
The guifts he giues,
The ioy she doth discouer.



1.
THAT is she, who kneeling there,
Seemes to haue no hope, nor feare
Out of heauen, wherin her eyes
Fix't (as if the cleerer skyes
Were her mirrour) seeke to find
Graces fitting to her mynd.
Her hands foulded ech in one,
As if only they alone,
(Earth not owing any such)
Did deserue ech others touch.
Beg of Heau'n by ardent pray'r,
Her deare louers quicke repayre.



2.
She, no other Iewell wears
Then her owne congealed tears,
Which, on simple Goodnes set,
Make a pretious Carcanet.
Her attyre is strange to gold,
And as farre from rich, as old,
Which receaues no other staynes
Then it's natiue, but remaynes
White as is the Sheep that bears it,
Pure as is the Soule that wears it.
Sandalls do conceale her feet,
On her head, are Flowers sweet.



3.
Beauty there (whoeuer seeks)
Sits inthron'd vpon her cheeks,
In a colour, red as Roses,
Or when first the morne discloses,
White, as mountayns when it snows,
Or the yielding downe, that grows
On the breasts of Swans, and Doues,
Spread with hayre, that when it moues
Casts amazment on our sight,
T'is so excellently bright.
One may seeke the world, to find
Such a forme, with such a mynd.



4.
Now the Bridall pompe draw's neere,
And the noyse hath reach't her Eare,
Eares, her Heart informe of all,
Heart leapes vp, and Loue doth call,
Loue, sends Curiosity
Vp in hast, vnto the Eye,
Eyes, looke out, and Ioy appeares:
Poore Ioy, almost drown'd in teares,
Running to the heart in hast,
Sowing rumours as he past,
Puts her in Alarum so,
Where she is, she doth not know.



5.
Her swift eyes, that highly moue,
Mounted on the wings of Loue,
Or'looke all, but no where bide,
Till theyr prey they haue espyed,
When she enuying of her eyes,
Straight to his imbraces flyes,
Where she now remayns intwin'd,
Hands in hands, as hearts are ioyn'd
Sugred words, with sighings mixt,
Eyes vpon his beauty fixt,
All, her loue and ioy declare,
For to see her Bridegroome there.



6.
Vnto some it strange may be,
That so great a King as he,
Would so farre from State descend,
To make choyce of such a frend,
Who, her birth can neyther boast,
Nor (what takes our liking most)
Doth in richer cloathing go,
To affect the outward show.
Beauty without wealth, some few,
Yet can be content to view:
But if Vertue want them eyther,
She's prefer'd by none to neyther.



7.
Let such know, her Innocence
He esteemes, full competence
For to match the highest State,
As was euer enuyed at.
Others (though th'are poore respects
Which her noble mynd neglects,
And disdaynes to Court,) yet He
Of meere loue, and care (that She
May not suffer disesteeme,
In those wants, the world doth deeme
So essentiall,) for her Honour,
Will bestow them all vpon her.



8.
And with Riches, which is first
After our accompt (though worst)
He in such a sort indews her,
As it takes, who euer views her
With a iust esteeme, and wonder
How much earthly wealth comes vnder.
She herselfe is all a Mine,
And in euery act doth shine,
So much true, and perfect wealth,
As euen Auarice it's selfe,
Such a Treasure to behould
Would despise it's baser gould.



9.
This, the Priuiledge hath giuen
To en-title her to Heauen,
Co-heyre with those Blessed sprit's,
Who are drown'd with all delights
In that Sea of ioy,  blisse,
Where no end, no measure is.
This is True Nobility,
This is that, with cannot dy,
This is it, which doth not clayme,
Others Worth, to guild it's shame;
But it selfe, it's selfe commends
Vnto Honour, Fame, and Frends.



10.
Now the heauenly Quires do presse
To bestow theyr Kisse of Peace
On this happy Soule, they see
In such heyght of Dignity.
Now the Bridegroome doth conduct her,
Whilst his Mother doth instruct her,
To the Temple, as behou's,
To confirme theyr Blessed loues,
By the wishes wayted on
Of all present ioyn'd in one;
That no cause be giuen euer
This theyr Heauenly match to seuer.



The Allegory.
IN the Prayer of the Bride, is to be noted that
we should be as carefull, in regard of Gods
greatnes, to receaue him worthily, as desirous
in respect of our owne wants, to receaue him of|ten.
By the playnnes and simplicity of the Brides
attyre, is signifyed that innocency  purity, which
is required in those soules, whome he doth please to
visit with his gratious presence. The Iewell of
her Teares, doth shew that Sorrow for our of|fences,
by which we should duly prepare our selues,
vnto the receauing of him. Her Sandalls the Hu|mility,
and Flowers, the gratefull odour of our
workes, and merits.
What is sayd of Beauty, both heere, or in
any other place, is meant and to be vnderstood only
of the Soule, whose inuisible Fayrenes can no ways
be rendred perceptible to sense, but by Examples
of visible Excellency. That she hath not any ri|ches
of her owne, but what are bestow'd vpon
her by the Bridgroome, doth shew, that God
giues not Vertue to any, in respect of wealth,
but wealth oftentimes, in regard of theyr Ver|tue;
and that we are not further to care for them,
then it is his pleasure we should inioy them.




The third Canto.

ARGVMENT.
The Marriage in the Church,
The Rites expres't,
Her Reuerence, and
Inuiting him her guest.



1.
NOW with due becomming state
They haue entred all, the Gate
Of the Temple, arch't with gould,
Rich and shining to behould,
Rew'd with Iaspar pillars, set
On fayre bases all of Iet,
Marble which the sight doth vary
On the pauement (as in Quarry)
All one piece doth seeme to be,
It was ioyn'd so curiously.
With cleare lights, the Iles are taper'd
With perfumes the Vaults are vapour'd.



2.
They, not farre had led the Bride,
When before her she espyed
A fayre Picture, did of right
Challenge euery Virgin-sight.
Twa's the Kingdome of the Blessed,
By so liuely skill expressed,
As it made her nigher draw,
Thinking all was true, she saw;
And deceau'd, with listning eare,
To assay, if she could heare
Musicke, which the Angells made,
Whilst they sung, and whilst they play'd.



3.
Twa's an Omen lik't her well,
Wherfore she did longer dwell
On the sight therof, and tooke
More delight from euery looke.
There she saw the Virgin Quires,
Shining bright with Holy-fyers,
Following of the Lambe along,
Seeming for to sing a song,
Which (a Scedule there did say)
None in Heauen could sing but they.
Much she had conceyu'd before,
But, this sight did adde much more,



4.
Longer she would fayne haue stayd,
But her stay, she was affrayd
Might to some seeme to discouer
A neglecting of her Louer.
And (who knows) perhaps, withall
Some her indiscreet might call,
Who in fay'nd things could delight,
Whilst the true on's were in sight.
Therfore wisely she went on,
Though resolu'd, when she was gone,
Deepe in heart away to beare
All imprest, she had seen there.



5.
Now they nigh the Altar come,
And in order fill the roome,
All prepare to be imply'd;
Virgins to attend the Bride,
Priests to Celebrate the Rites,
Angells to assist with Lights,
Musicke, and Perfume: ther's none
Whose imployment is not knowne;
Euery one doth take some care,
And if any Idle were,
They with wishes do assist
The Bride, the Bridgroome, and the Priest.



6.
Tw'as to all the Saints a sight,
Did beget them much delight,
To obserue the trembling Bride,
Kneeling by her Louers side,
How her well composed eye
Neuer cast a looke awry,
For to catch at Thoughts, which might
Bring distraction with the sight:
But did reu'rently regard
All she saw, and all she heard,
Whilst the Priest set all things forth,
With state, equall to theyr worth.



7.
Though she wish't the time were come.
That might ioyne them both in one,
And (to thinke too long) had cause
Euery little stay, or pause:
Yet as euery Rite did passe,
So attent, and glad she was,
As if ech, the reason were
Only of her comming there.
Whe~ to Heau'n forKyrie eleison. help they call,
She her voyce doth ioyne with all.
To the like her mynd they moue
When they glorifyGloria in excelsis her Loue.



8.
When theySanctus Holy do proclayme him
She with much delightDominus Deus. doth name him.
When theyEleuatio~. shew him vnto all,
There is none doth lower fall,
With more humblenes before him,
For to reuerence, and adore him.
When they call to myndAgnus dei. his Crosse
Who can more resent his losse?
When they do professe,Domine on sum di|nus. ther's none
Worthy of him, She alone
Thinks ther's none, her eyes can see
But is worthier farre then she.



9.
But at last when she's inuited
By due prayers, and Tapers lighted,
To draw neare, and takeCommu|nion. her Louer,
O what Ioye doth she discouer?
Teares her eyes had ouerflow'd
Sighs burst forth, and playnly shew'd,
Though Ioy, would not let her speake
They must vent, or she must breake.
He as much Loue did expresse,
As she Ioy, and tendernes,
When thus solemnly they both,
Ech to other plight theyr troth.



10.
The Brides declaration of
her Loue.

1.
The World shall sooner want the sunns faire light.
The Moone extinguisht be, and put out quite,
The starres in darknes leaue the heau'ns aboue.


2.
The spring shall sooner cause the dayes grow short,
And fading Autumne, make them longer for't,
Shippes, on the land shall sayle about,  moue.


3.
Cartes shall be drawne the liquid waters o're,
Fishes i'th woods shall liue, i'th sea the boare
Shall sooner find his food, and where to tread.


4.
Then I shall cease to loue thee, euer deere,
Whether I breath the life which I haue heere,
Or el's am numbred with the gastly dead.




11.
The Bridgroomes to her.

1.
Nature may proue a Stepdame to the Earth,
Spring may refuse to giue her Flowers birth,
And tender Mothers hate theyr first borne child.


2.
Fayre Vertue from her Goodnes may depart,
And Vice may raigne without the conscience smart,
All loue from gentle Breasts may be exild.


3.
The Sunne may leaue the day, the Moone the night,
Prosperity her Ioy, and Enuy spight,
The auaricious may despise his Gould.


4.
But I, deare soule, can neuer change from thee,
Whilst Loue and Vertue which haue taken me,
Keep in thy heart that place which now they hould.




12.
Then whilst Angells sweetly sing,
On her hand he puts a Ring;
Ring, which had such vertuous might,
To expell with only sight,
All Temptations Sinne doth breed
In the thought, the word, or deed;
In the mynd a luster setting
By pure thoughts of it's begetting.
Thus the Ceremonyes done,
All preparing to be gone,
She her Spouse, that day her guest,
Lead's vnto the Marriage feast



The Allegory.
BY the picture, vpon which the Bride so libe|rally
bestowed her eyes, at her Entrance
into the Temple, is signifyed, those good
Thoughts and Cogitations, which the holines of
such places doth often suggest vnto vs. By her with|drawing
her sight from it, assoone as she remembred
she had other more necessary things to do; is shewed
that we should neuer so dwell on the delectation of
any one good worke, as therby to neglect a greater.
In her Deuotion and Attention during the
Celebration of the holy mysteries, we are taught,
how we are to concur with the Action and Inten|tion
of him who Celebrates.
By her Ring, may be vnderstood the memory of
our B. Sauiour, on which if we but often  se|riously
reflect, it is impossible we should be so vn|gratefull
to him, and trayterous to our selues, as to
betray the Fort of our Innocency (by the In|telligence
eyther of thought, word, or act) vn|to
any Vice, or Imperfection.




The fourth Canto.

ARGVMENT.
The Nuptiall Feast, wherin
Is much commended,
Her Drinke,  Fare; but
In excesse she ended.



1.
HENCE exulting Ioy, begone,
Els thou'lt kill the Bride anone.
She doth feed with soules delight,
And, as if her Bridgroomes sight
Her, like him, did heauenly make,
Hath forgot all food to take.
How her eyes are fixt on his,
Scarse belieuing her owne blisse,
That so poore a Soule, as she
Should be Loue, to such as he,
And when most assur'd t'is true,
Then, she most doth wonder new.



2.
Melting snow, that hills doth crowne,
Toucht with sunshine, runs not downe
Swifter, nor more currents seeks
Then the teares vpon her cheeks.
Much I feare they'l ne're haue done!
Now to see his face, they runne
Trickling downe, and now as fast
When she finds, that they haue cast
Such a mist her eyes before,
She can scarcely see him more:
So betwixt her Ioyes and Feares,
Teares, are only cause of Teares.



3.
In the mid'st of all our noyse
Singing loude theyr Nuptiall Ioyes,
She her silence breaks no more,
Then the fishe when seas do roare,
Least perhaps to gayne discourse,
She, herselfe doth wisely force
For to lend a word to lone
Of a thousand words for one:
But the whilst, as they are payd,
Blessed Heauen, how she's affrayd
Least ech one should be the last,
So too soone her gayne be past.



4.
Why is all this Musicke heere?
See, it neuer takes her eare.
Angells, though you play, and sing
Till the Ayre with Eccho ring,
Though t'is sweet, and rare, yet she
Is so farre from thanking yee,
As sh' admirs how you can do
Any thing, but hearken to
Those his hony-flowing Words
Which into her Eare affoards
Sounds more sweet, more pleasing farre,
Then your Quiers, or Consorts are.



5.
Why d'ye lauish, and consume
So much rich, and choyce perfume?
She alone might well suffice,
For to sweeten all the skyes,
With those sighs, which she doth spend
Without measure, without end.
Griefe, before I euer knew
Ioy, could weepe as well as you,
Swoune, and suffer, all speach bar'd,
But such sigh's I neuer heard
Soft, I see therin doth lye
Yet some deeper mystery.



6.
Marke her, she doth vse to frame
Of her breath, her Louers Name,
Tasting which, her mouth receaues
All the gust, that hony leaues.
Oh Repast deuine, and rare!
By that Food we nourisht' are
Which we take, and in receaue;
She, by that, which she doth leaue:
Yet th' effect is far more strange,
Foode in vs to Earth doth change,
Hers, in Him, to Heauen; so breath
Wisely hath beguiled death.



7.
But some Epicure will say,
She consumes herselfe this way,
Not supplying Natures needs,
But doth languish as she feeds.
Peace, thou Earthly mynd, thy food
Changeth first to flesh and bloud,
Sicknes doth thereon awayt,
That brings death, her dyet straight
Turnes to life, and better spirit,
Fills her full with glorious Merit,
Doth her soule at last commend
Vnto Life, can neuer end.



8.
Now, when she doth list to drinke,
Oh what humane thought can thinke
On the sweetnes, which she tasts,
Whilst her draught delicious lasts!
Yet, deare soule, how ere you fayne,
I do see, it brings you payne,
Whilst you drinke out of a wound,
Not alone, for Loue you sound,
Bee't in feet, in hands, or side,
In conceipt it opens wide,
Euen as deepe a wound in you,
As those pretious ones you view.



9.
Drinke not, thirsty soule, so deepe,
Temp'rance bids a measure keepe.
Scandall doth arise from such,
Who vnwary, drinke too much.
She all counsayle doth despise,
Stops her Eares, and firmes her Eyes,
Euery daught begets a thirst,
Hoat and fiercer then the first.
O how great the daunger is,
Least some harme. do follow this!
And now see, She leanes her head
In her Louers armes, as dead.



10.
Angells beare her forth, I feare
Much the cause; she's stifled here:
Ther's no doubt her health's impayre
May be help't with better ayre.
But himselfe alone sustaynes
All the burthen, all the paynes,
Thinking nothing throughly done,
'Lesse his Blessed selfe be one,
Rubbe her Temples, bow her head
Beare her to the Mariage Bed:
Feare not, she'le reuiue anone,
When her Extasy is gone.



The Allegory.
IN all this Feast is nothing els to be vnder|stood,
then only the tender and pious affections
which are incited, and stired vp, in high Con|templatiue
Soules, by the receauing of the
B. Sacrament, as namely their Deuout
Colloquies, seasoned in tears,  mixt with
sighes, to giue the more delicate tast  relish to
theyr high-fed Soules, and also the strict
watch they keep on theyr Attentions, to barre
the entrance of any thoughts may bring distra|ction
with them. By her swoning, is signifyed
the sweet force of the Diuine Loue, which (as if
it had changed dartes with Death) doth oftenti|mes
leaue the Bodies vnto the Graue, by enti|cing
from them the Soules, vnto the loyes of
Heauen. Lastly, by the Angells Care, and
Bridgroomes diligence, in bearing of her forth
out of that close Chamber where she was (the
world) into Heauen, her Bridall Chamber, is
shewen, that God is neuer wanting to assist
them at theyr Deaths, whose Vertues whilst
they liue on Earth, do labour a sure and per|fect
Friendship, betwixt them and Heauen.




The fifth Canto.

ARGVMENT.
The Chamber of the Bride,
Her' maze, it's stayres.
Theyr Ioy, the rest, the
Angells song declares.



1.
NOW, they vp a wondrous stayre,
Farre aboue all noysome ayre,
T'wards her chamber beare the Bride,
When not able to abide
Such a brightnesse, such a height,
Leaden Death, with his owne weight,
Fell to ground, from of her eyes,
In a graue, where now he lyes.
Then they straight vnclos'd, and gaz'd
At her being so amaz'd,
As tw'as long ere she could giue
Her selfe credit, she did liue.



2.
And who could refuse to wonder,
For to see Earth lye vnder
Such vnmeasur'd way below
As t'was almost lost to shew.
For to see the waters stand
Like a wall about the Land,
And without so surely fenc't
With the moyster ayre condens't,
For to see the humble fyer
Neyther burne, nor mount vp higher!
None of these but might amaze
One who far more bouldnes ha's.



3.
Yet this wonder did not last,
For her eye aside she cast
And in it, lost all her feare,
When she saw her Bridgroome there.
That which made her wonder cease,
May perhaps make ours increase.
She of all strange things that were
By one glaunce on him, more cleere
Did the hidden Causes see,
Then within a Mirrour, we
Our owne faces, when we looke,
Studying most that flat'ring booke.



4.
So all Wonder turn'd to Loue,
Loue in her, a Heauen did proue,
Heauen, as they did go, was there,
Heauen they came to eu'ry where.
Heauen within her, and without,
Heauen aboue, and round about:
Heauen is in her Eyes, and Eares,
Nothing now but Heauen appeares,
In ech sense, in euery part,
In her mouth, her louing heart,
And these Heauens are all, alone
In her Bridgroome, ioyn'd in one.



5.
She without all payne doth goe,
(That vn'wares she left below
On the vnder floore of clay,
Whilst in deadly trance she lay,
For some faynt, and worldly mind
Dares not higher go, to find.)
And they now arriued are
On the highest Christall stayre,
Ioyning to a porche of gould,
(Eyes did ne're the like behould)
That directly in doth guide
To the Chamber of the Bride.



6.
See the dores do open stand,
And the Bridgroome by the hand
(Whilst the Saints his prayses sing)
His fayre crowned Spouse leads in,
All the Soules that heauen had euer,
There stand ready to receaue her,
For her glory, euery one
Far more glad then for theyr owne:
Yet ther's none hath more exprest,
Of a glad, and ioyfull breast,
Nor of Loue more pledges giuen,
Then the sacred Queene of Heauen.



7.
Those whose Ioyes, are at the height,
Thinke th'are happyer in her sight,
And who know th'are loued most,
Such a Riuall soonest boast,
They so hast her in to beare,
As our Night begins, I feare,
And those Glory's which we see
Too to soone, will vanish't be.
Darknesse winnes vpon the skies,
Now they lessen in our eyes,
To a Starre, which was a Sunne,
Now a sparke, and now th'are gone,



8.
What a darke, and vgly sight,
After so much Glorious Light,
This blacke Clod of Earth Appeares.
But, what Musicke strikes our Eares?
Sure, t'is that the Angells make,
For the Bride, and Bridgroomes sake:
Which whilst Eccho brings to ground,
Trauayle doth enrich the sound.
Let vs hearken what they say,
Somewhat may be learn't this way
Hearing that, we cannot see
Is of Ioy the next degree.




HIEROTHALAMIVM.

I.
SING Io Hymen, chastest Hymen all,
And with loude voyce the Brides great Ioyes repeate,
So Eccho tost, as not a word let fall.
May make them seem lesse sou~ding then th'are great.
But in this heyght th'are at,
May they for euer be
That euen the Saints, when as they see,
And haue her Blessings knowne,
May thinke ther's somwhat wa~ting of theyr owne.
Yet Ioy with her, and wish her more beside,
And ioyne with vs, in hon'ring of the Bride.



II.
Now world farwell, she thinks on thee no more,
Or if she doth, it is but to compare
With much disdayne, thy wants, with her great store.
Thy course feeding, with her daynty fare,
Thy mynds perpetuall care,
With her Soules lasting peace,
Thy Barrennes, with her Increase;
Thy want of sense to choose
Such things, for wealth, which her doth them re|fuse
Make only rich; Thy thousand woes beside,
With the perpetuall blessings of the Bride.



III.
You need not boast your Issue, nor be glad,
T'is but a wreched shift, that Nature finds
For to repayre the Spoyles, that Death hath made,
The Sower of all Cares in Pare~ts mynds,
Which she who well declines,
Doth soone find, what a blest
And happy change sh'as made, by rest
She feels with in her soule,
When no vnquiet thought, doth there controule,
Or vrge those Cares, which Ease doth not abide,
Happy are such, thrice happy is the Bride.



IIII.
It is theyr Ioy, who grieue that they are old,
To haue some Issue they may leaue behind,
And in theyr sight, theyr passed youths behold,
Ioy, is but Ease of Griefe in humane kind.
Who want's doth seeke to find,
Who hunger's, food doth loue:
But happy soules, who are aboue
The need, and lacke of these!
Heere, are delights which neuer know decrease,
Heere, youth is lasting, life doth euer bide,
Ioy wayt's on it, They all, vpon the Bride.



V.
No Ielou'sy her quiet heart molest's,
No feare, of too vntimely losse of life,
No heauy care, that presseth maryed breasts,
No cause of grudging, or contentious strife
The woe of man, wife.
No Lothing, but the same
Fyer, which now burnes with holy flame,
To light theyr Loues to day,
Will euer last,  neuer can decay;
For he hath chose, who ca~not cha~ge abide
To haue her euer for his Spouse and Bride.



The Allegory.
or Conclusion.
TOVCHING the Allegory in this
last Canto, little is to be sayd. The
Stayres by which the Bride was borne vp vn|to
her Bridall Chamber, do allude vnto the
Elements and Planets, which (according to
the Astrologers) do fill vp by their orderly di|stances,
the space betwixt Heauen and Earth,
wherin I make the Caeum Cristallinum (fol|lowing
the Generall opinion) the highest steppe of
this stayre, and next adioyning to the Caelum
Empyreum, or habitation of the Blessed.
It may to some perhaps, seeme some want
of good manners in Art to bring the Bride only to
the Entrance of her Bridall Chamber, and there
abruptly to leaue her  follow her no further: But
if the Paynter Timant, was thought worthy of
prayse, for paynting Agamemnon (present
when his daughter Iphigenia was to be sacri|ficed,)
with his face couered, signifying that his
Griefe was greater, then could be seene in his

countenance; I see no reason, why I should be bla|med,
for passing those Ioyes in silence, which are
greater then can be comprehended by humayne
sense, or Imagination. Besides, that breuity which
I haue studyed from the beginning, loath now to
loose it's Palme at the later end, did hasten me
away from more prolixity, by affoarding me this
reason: That it was euery way auaylable vnto this
worke, and me; that those who were delighted
with it, should be sory it is so short, and those
who were not, should be glad it is no longer.
