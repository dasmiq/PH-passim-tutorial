TO THE No less Vertuous than Ingenious M^r^i^s MARY MORE; Upon Her Sending Sir Thomas More's PICTURE (OF HER OWN DRAWING) TO THE LONG GALLERY AT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS In OXON.
MADAM,
YOur Benefaction has bin such,
That few can think it is a Womans Touch:
So to the Life was Issa drawn Mart. Epigr. 110. Lib. I. (the Bitch)
That the Beholder doubted which was which.
Seldom so Rare an Artist hath there bin;
Yet every Lady Knows to Draw Man In.
Since then Your Pencil far exceeds our Pen,
Let it be said I was the First of Men
Could stop in ScriblingKnow we study Thrift,
And fancy This a Richer New-Years-Gift.
When One in Shadows, T'other deals in Rime,
Painters and Poets should knock off in Time.
Janus will knit both Brows too, if I trouble You
Longer, or interrupt Him,
Yours, R. W X^b^r^i^s 26. 1674.
