THE HAPPY
Future State of England:
OR,
A DISCOURSE by way of LETTER to
the late EARL of ANGLESEY, Vindicating Him
from the Reflections of an AFFIDAVIT Published by the
HOUSE of COMMONS, A^o. 1680. by occasion whereof Observations
are made concerning Infamous WITNESSES.
The said Discourse likewise contains various Political Remarks
and CALCULATIONS referring to many Parts of Christendom;
with Observations of the Number of the People of ENGLAND,
and of its Growth in Populousness and Trade. The Vanity of
the late Fears and Iealousies being shewn, the Author doth on
Grounds of Nature Predict the Happy future State of the Realm.
At the End of the Discourse,
There is a Casuistical Discussion of the Obligation of the KING,
His Heirs and Successors, wherein many of the Moral Offices of Absolute
and Vnconditional Loyalty are Asserted.
Before the Discourse, is
A large PREFACE, giving an Account of the whole WORK,
with an Index of the Principal Matters.
ALSO,
The Obligation resulting from the Oath of SUPREMACY
to Assist and Defend the Preheminence or Prerogative
OF THE
Dispensative Power
Belonging to the KING, His Heirs and Successors.
In the Asserting of that Power, various Historical Passages occurring in the Vsurpation
after the Year 1641. are mentioned, and an Account is given of the Progress of the Power of
Dispensing, as to Acts of Parliament about Religion since the Reformation, and of diverse Judg|ments
of Parliaments, declaring their Approbation of the Exercise of such Power, and par|ticularly
in what concerns Punishment by Disability or Incapacity.
LONDON, Printed MDCLXXXVIII.




To the Right Honorable the
Earl of Sunderland,
Lord President of His Majesty's most
Honorable Privy-Council, and Prin|cipal
Secretary of State, and Knight
of the most Noble Order of the
GARTER.
MY LORD,
_FOR one who is sensible how little he knows of things past or
present, to Dedicate a Discourse of the future State of his
Country to your Lordship, who are by the Age allow'd to be
as Critical a Iudge of Men and Things as any it affords, may
seem to have in it somewhat of Presumption. But when
your Lordship shall have had leisure to consider the plain
Grounds of Nature, on which my Prediction in the following
Papers hath gone, I will not so much hope that what I have attempted may
appear to have been no Presuming, as I will expect that your Censure will
cast the Presumption on the other side, namely, on such who were Predictors
with a continuando, of the Unhappy State of their Country; and especially
on the account of the Religion of our most Gracious Prince. And were I now
to have my Iudgment tryed only by that of the Mobile, who measure all things
by the Events, I account I should be out of the Gunshot of Censure, since the
course of Providence after my writing of the following Work having Con|ducted
His Majesty to fill the Throne of his Ancestors with so many Royal
Virtues, it has been Conspicuous to them that the Glories of his Reign
have transcended the highest flights of my mentioned Expectation.
And indeed, as I remember to have long ago heard one of the Fathers cited
for a Passage to this purpose, namely, that on a Supposal that God recounting to
him the Perfections of the Creation, should ask him what he could name want|ing,
and that he could wish, he would answer, Unum Laudatorem, Domine,
so it might till of late be said that in this new Creation or Restoration of Eng|land
under His Majesty's Reign, the only thing we had with anxiety to wish
and desire from God next to the ennabling us to Praise his divine Goodness,
was one whose Talent of noble thoughts and words might be adequate to the
celebrating the many Talents of our Prince, and their successful Improvement
both for the Honour and Security, and Ease of his People.
But neither is such one Praiser now wanting; for he who shall read the
many late Loyal Addresses from all Parts of the Kingdom, will find the People
of England to be the Unus Laudator.

My Lord, as I in the following Discourse almost wholly Printed long ago in
the last Reign during the freedom of the Press, adventured on Grounds of Na|ture
to predict such a growth of Loyalty, as would make all England become
one sober Party of Mankind, and that the more ingenious sort of Iesuits
would by natural Instinct throw off those Principles condemned in this Pope's
Decree; and with Iustice then acknowledged a Sober Party in that order, and
have at large in p. 322. particularly shew'd my Abhorrence of charging the
belief or practice of those Principles on all Persons in that Order: So I have
likewise in p. 238. given my Iudgment that all Seditious Principles own'd
by any who call'd themselves Protestants must naturally decay, and have at
large in my Preface opposed my measures of futurity to those of a late Fa|ther
of the Church of England concerning the two Plots, that he thought the
Papists and Dissenters would be ever carrying on, and without his Lordships
excepting the Loyal in those religionary Parties.
But having said this, I must likewise say that these happy births of Fate,
having been but (as it were) the Births of a Day under the Powerful Influ|ences
of His Majesty's Government, or (as I may say) a Nation's being thus
born in a Day, are beyond what I did expect: and I did little think that
with the suddenness of the motion of Lightning when it melts the Sword and
spares the Scabbard, His Majesty's Declaration of Indulgence to Dissenters,
would at the same time melt so many hearts, and all hostile Principles of the
Doctrine of Resistance wrapp'd therein, as it spared the Persons of the deluded
Opiners. I account that any indifferent Observer of the extraordinary sweet|ness
of the way of painting their Loyalty in their Addresses (and which re|sembleth
the way of Corregio, and is as excellent in its kind as that of the
Sons of the Church of England after the way of the bolder touches of Titian
in their former Addresses, with the Style of LIVES AND FORTUNES was
in its) must be very hard-hearted if he likewise be not melted into a new kind
of Compassion toward such his Brethren; and into a noble sense of a great and
good Prince, having made his Subjects of all Religionary Perswasions Lachry|mists
for Joy, and turned all their hearts to invoke Heaven in wishing for him
according to that old Style, a long Life, a secure Kingdom, a safe House,
valiant Armies, a faithful Senate, loyal Subjects, the world at Peace, c.
The comparatively narrow Idea's of Charity and Beneficence that Subjects
Minds are capable of toward one another do incline them to think chiefly of
particular Toleration, and such as we call Dispensation, and that too with the
nicety of Caution, and upon Persons making the notification of their Princi|ples,
and their particular disclaiming of all Disloyal ones, previous to their
Toleration; and beyond this pitch the flights of my poor thoughts have not
gone in the following Work. But His Majesty having his Great thoughts in|tent
on restoring England to its ancient Figure in the World, namely of ba|lancing
it, and coming to the Throne when he found the Land so impoverish'd
y the Witnesses Plot, and the spirits of the Inhabitants so much intimidated
with Fears and Iealousies, he by his own noble Iealousie for the Honour of the
Nation hath chased away all ignoble Iealousies for ever, and by shewing so
great an Example of Universal Confidence in his People, hath by his Augus
Genius found out so expedite a way to make the Confidence between the Prince
and People mutual (and which is the hinge on which the Happy State of any
Country turns) as hath made any general Relapses into Principles of disloy|alty
during his Reign, almost morally impossible. For according to that Saying
of Tully, Perditissimi est hominis eum laedere qui laesus non esset, nisi re|didisset,
and the Common Notion that next to the being perfectly good, it is
the most difficult thing to bring Humane Nature to be perfectly bad,
we may well expct a general growth of Loyalty from the Effects of that

great Confidence, and the great Spectacle it affords the World, that may
be partly expressed in the words of the Prophet, viz. The heart of the
Father's being turned to the Children, and the natural Consequence of the
turning the heart of the Children to their Father; a more noble work then
for an Elias to come and solve Doubts.
And thus while the Principles of some narrow-hearted Divines might
seem confined, like the Sands in their Hour-glasses, yet His Majesty's
great Thoughts and largeness of heart given him by God, being (as was said
of Solomon's) like the Sands of the Sea shoar, and he having without setting
up Weigh-houses for Loyalty or Religionary Principles, created universal Cha|rity
and Peace in the Nation, and allow'd his Subjects a paul majora ca|namus
then verbal Recantations, he by thus trusting his Subjects at once with
their Consciences, hath provided an otherguess Prospect for English Minds,
then what can rise from disputacity, or the Ecclesiarum Scabies, and
hath likewise secured the transmitting of his Character into the English Chro|nicles
with such Rays of Glory as are brighter then those that have there
adorn'd our former Princes, under whom the Roses, and Scepters and King|doms
were united, through his having so much united the hearts of People of
all Religions to himself, and to one another.
My Lord, It is here but just that I should acknowledge it to your Lordship
that you have been and are Pars Magna in so highly Contributing by your
great Figure at the Helm in the last and this present Reign, to this happy
State of England. For while in that Reign so many were so intent by what
an ingenious late Writer calls The Wheel within a Wheel, i. e. the Real Plot
within the Nominal one of the Witnesses; and by Out-cries against the
Church of Rome to bring in a Roman Republick, your Lordship by your most
wise Councels and indefatigable diligence in guarding the Monarchy, and
effecting that it should not be plotted away by Names or Things, will appear
in the History of the Age, as one who perhaps beyond any one now a Subject
secured the old Fundamental Government of England, and upon which only the
new future Happiness of it could subsist.
I have entertain'd the Reader with a new Argument of Republicks gene|rally
growing more impracticable: but I shall do but justice to your Lordship in
representing your very Character as an Argument of sufficient weight to
poise the minds of the ingenious and the ingenuous against innovations by
that sort of Government. For the World would soon want the benefit of the
Example of the perfect justice inherent in your nature (that glorious Virtue
that is the allow'd Continent of all the rest, and necessarily attracting the
Eyes and Hearts and Veneration of the Populace) if Heaven had not fix'd
you in the Sphere of Monarchy; a dull Mediocrity of Vertue and of Wit and
reason being only easie to a popular Government, and nothing but an Oyster-Shell
or an Olive-Leaf being to be there expected by a Person heroically just
to his Country as his recompence, and his being always liable to such liberae
accusationes  Calumniationes as were under what I have call'd the
Martyrocracy here in the turbid Interval of the Plot-times, and of the Fears
and Iealousies.
Your Lordship was then by the help of your great Vnderstanding and ex|cellent
Temper, and your constant Serenity of thought, saevis tranquillus in
undis; and while so many of the timid were with their narrow spirits in
that stormy Conjuncture, toss'd about with excessive Fears and Iealousies,
and nauseous to themselves and others, your Lordships great thoughts like a
well built first Rate-Ship, allow'd you both Ease and Triumph on the Sea of
Time: and in the Night of the Popular Fears, your great Reason was dire|ctive
to the Loyal tanquam lucerna in navi Praetori how and where to steer
their Course with safety to the Publick.

While toward the End of the following Discourse, I recollected how much
and how far my belief had been with that of many Loyal embarqued in the
belief of a Plot or the Plot, I there in p. 359, and 360. took notice that
the Notions that men had of a Plot were very various: Some then were
so far gone in credulity, as like the Fool that Solomon saith believeth eve|ry
word, they were resolv'd to believe every thing the Witnesses had said
or would say, the Loyal generally acquiesced in the Notification of it as
Publish'd by the Government; and I likewise call'd to mind what I had
during my belief of somewhat of it mention'd in those hot Times, and while.
I was writing the warmest part of my Discourse in that Conjuncture, and
when generally every heat of mens Passions was Feverish, and every Fe|ver
Pestilential, and when the Vitium temporis was Concurrent with the
Faults of the Writer: and there in p. 14. observing, that since according to
the expression of God's not being the God of the Jews only, but also of
the Gentiles, so it being true that the King is King of the Papists as well as
Protestants, King of the Irish as well as English, and a Common Father to
them all, it may be worthy of his royal goodness, and a god-like thing
in him to distribute to them all the kindness that would not undo them|selves
and others, (i. e. that they were capable of) and having then in
p. 44. urged the possibility of Recusants being a sound part of the State here
as well as in Holland, I held my self obliged to do them and the Course of my
Impartial observing, the right as toward the end of the Discourse to men|tion
it, that whatever petulance some of them were formerly guilty of,
yet that the deportment of the generality of them hath of late appear'd
with such a Face of Loyalty, as was necessarily attractive of our Christian
Love and Compassion. And I concluded with the Observation, That it was
not for nothing, nor without some end that Divine Providence permitted so
many Protestants to erre in one great Point; and that probably it might
be to the end to produce in their Minds so great a degree of Compassion
and Charity toward the Persons of all Roman-Catholick Christians, as
may not only last in this Conjuncture, but be operative in them by all Moral
Offices of Humanity and Christianity during their Lives.
But the Course of Providence having further honoured His Majesty's Go|vernment
by bringing to light in it the Truth about those odious Matters that
particular Roman-Catholicks were charged with, (and for which in the general
Iudgment of the Impartial they appear now to have been put to Death by false
Testimony) the cry of such Blood may well (I think) pass for a loud Call
against making the Body of the Roman-Catholicks uneasie by the Penal Laws,
and while the Reason for their Severity hath so apparently ceased.
As toward the latter end of the Preface which was committed to Writing in
the latter end of the last Reign, I mention'd it as the Concordant vogue of the
Populace to throw off the belief of the only Person referr'd to as a witness in
the following Discourse, so it must be acknowledged that Time hath by its
births of Discovery, now given a just occasion for the laying aside all the Ag|gravations
there against any Principles in the Canon-Law, or the Casuistical
Morals of the Iesuits, that my self and others then built on the Fate of
Godfrey: and hath acording to what I have predicted concerning the Fate
of the Principles of the Iesuites Condemned by this Pope, tacitly evaporating
by Fear and Shame, made them appear obsolete. And it is one of the Glories
of His Majesty's Reign, that all those Principles in terrorem, which gave
occasion formerly for the Continuance of the Laws in terrorem, do now appear
offer'd up as Sacrifices to the Iustice of it. And tho from the account I found in
The Policy of the Clergy of France of the Fact of some of the Iesuits having
opposed the Publication of that Decree in France, as having issued from the Pope

in his Court of Inquisition, I took occasion to dilate on the Aggravations of their
Disobedience to the Pope, yet upon my having since enquired into the Transa|ctions
of the Papal World, I have found Cause to absolve them from any Cen|sure
of that kind.
And accordingly as the Ingenious Dr. Donne in his Pseudo-Martyr saith,
that Chrysostom expounding that place in Jeremy, Domus Dei facta est spe|lunca
Hyaenae, applies it to the Priests of the Iews as hardest to be conver|ted,
and saith, That the Hyaena having (as Chrysostom observes) but one
Back-bone, cannot turn except it turn all at once, so that the Romanist
Priests having but one Back-bone, the Pope, cannot turn but all at once
when he turns; it must be acknowledged that the Pope having by that his
noble Decree done so much right to his own Honour, and that of his Church
(and indeed of Humane nature) as to damn those tenets, the aversion of the
whole Order of the Iesuites from them was necessarily and naturally to
happen.
And from the Doctor in that Book applying further to the Iesuites, say|ing,
Christ said to those whom he sent, what I tell you in darkness, that
speak you in light, and what you hear in the Ear, that preach you in
Houses, and fear not them that kill the Body; and if no other thing were
told you in darkness, and whispered in your Ears at your missions hither
then that which our Saviour delivered to them, you might be as confident
in your publick preaching, and have as much comfort of Martyrdom, if
you died for executing such a Commission, and then reflecting on the instru|ctions
that were delivered them in darkness in that Conjuncture, for the pro|moting
those Papal Vsurpations on the Regal Rights, whereby they were deli|vered
from all subjection to the King; it may be here occasionally observed that
many persons of our several Religionary Perswasions having for Curiosity gone
to hear the publick Preaching of these Missionaries, have there met with such
ingenuous Explications of the Moral Offices that concern the most Vital parts of
Religion, and those so pathetically applied, as that they have looked on
such men who were formerly dead in Law, to be as it were sent from the dead
to make others better Christians and better Subjects, and to be thankful for
the Dispensative Power animating those for that purpose, and have found no
Cause to fear that they had any Politick whispers in their Missions to oppose the
Power of our Monarch more then their Brethren do that of the Great Neigh|bouring
one, and to whom in the litis-pendentia between him and the Pope
about the Regale, they adhered.
My Lord, as to what I adventured to predict of the success of his Majesties
Political Measures, his past Prudence so eminently appearing in the Series of
his Great Actions might sufficiently encourage me without any help from Enthu|siasme;
for Nullum numen abest, si sit prudentia. And the Supposal about
his coming to the Throne in great maturity of years, a thing that the prudence
of the Romans had strict regard to in the Age of their Consuls (and for
which Office none was qualified under the Age of 43 years) and his bringing
to the Throne a vast Treasure of Knowledge and Experience refin'd and solid
by many Experiments of Providence on himself, according to the Divine
words of Seneca de provid. Deus quos amat, indurat, recognoscit, exercet,
might well raise the highest expectation of his Conduct.
But yet neither was I without some regard therein to the common Course of
Divine Providence, even in this Life rewarding in any Illustrious Person a sig|nal
tenderness for Religion, and inquisitiveness in any Controverted Point
about it, and at last contrary to the most valuable secular Interest determining
his thoughts one way tho perhaps erroneously; and I will venture to conclude
that if it had imported the salvation of such an exemplary inquisitive honourer

of God (and who with great holy Exercise had defecated his thoughts from set|tlement
on any local Religion, as such) to have found out the truth in that
Problematick Point, God would have honoured him so far as to have sent an
Angel to direct him to it: and will expect that such a one whose delight was in
the Law of the Lord and therein did meditate day and night, tho he per|haps
comprehended not every thing aright in it, yet that he shall be like a
Tree planted by the Rivers of Water, that brings forth his fruit in his Sea|son,
and that his Leaf shall not wither, and that whatever he doth shall
prosper: and that his ways thus, pleasing God, he will make even his Ene|mies
to be at peace with him, and that he who makes peace in his high
places, and who can make peace between high and low, and makes men to
be of one mind in an House, will bless him with these Effects, and make him
grow in favour with God and Man.
My Lord, I shall in the next place take occasion to acquaint your Lordship that
in the Preface (and which every Candid Reader of any Book will peruse before
his reading of the Book) I do explain my self more clearly about some things and
words writt in the turbid times, and which as one saith well, are the worst times
to write in tho the best to write of: and I do not fear the wanting any mans par|don
who shall read over the whole, and which may well be expected before the al|lowance
of his Exceptions, tho it may seem as copious as one of the Bankers Bills
in Chancery. But because the former part of the Discourse necessarily requiring
those courser Colours relating to Popery to be first laid on, before the finr ones
and the gilding on the happy Future State of our Country; and for that to trou|ble
any ingenious men now with Notions of Popery were to hinder their repose in
the state I foretold, I have been at the pains of making a large INDEX, and where
I have directed the Reader how and where to enter into the New Heaven and
New Earth of his Country, without passing through the Purgatory of any expressi|ons
about Popery or the Plot: and perhaps the more Loyal and Ingenious Recu|sants
whether Roman-Catholick or Protestants there taking notice of some grate|ful
passages relating to some who were formerly of their perswasions being placed
near others that are less so, may be the more pleased therewith, accordingly
as my Lord Bacon observes, that a Rose set by Garlick is the sweeter.
Heaven having furnished your Lordships mind with so many Excellencies
that are extraordinary, I could wish that it had been my ability or fortune to
have here provided for your Entertainment somewhat of value that was not
vulgar. But my essaying, or offering here and there at some matter of thought
which by receiving its Form from your Lordships great reason, and particularly
in p. 158. and the following ones in my making it a Fundamental Principle for
the quiet of the World, that men are neither to get nor lose by Religion,
and my distinguishing in mens Hypotheses between their Principles denominable
as Religionary, and such Complicated therewith that are not so, and my ha|ving
judged that none ought to be severe to any Recusant before he hath a
Moral Certainty of such person having imbibed any of the Principles impu|table
to Recusancy that are irreligionary and unnatural, and my defiance of
the petulance of the Faction by my placing Lawrels on those Heads at which
it was throwing dirt, and my shewing how not only Christians of the Roman-Catholick
Church in its great spreading Latitude, but even those of the more
particular Church of Rome, and reverers of the Diocess or Court of Rome,
are under no obligation by the LATERAN Councel to be either Persecu|tors
or disloyal, may shew somewhat of my honest well wishes in this kind.
I am not so van as to think that any thing relating to Numbers or Political
Calculations in the Discourse can appear new to your Lordship, who are so
great a Master in that kind of Knowledge, that the most Curious of the Age
may therein beg instruction from you. But I shall here presume to acquaint your

Lordship, that I observing that many in the late Conjuncture whom I looked on
as honest, loyal, and learned and ingenious men, and some who had formerly
a gusto for the real Learning that refers to number, weight and measure, did ren|der
their Conversation so uneasie by talking of nothing but Popery, Popery (and
which I looked on as unentertaining and nauseous as the Porke, porke  porke)
I thought it might be publickly useful to lay open a new Scene of Thought before
such Persons by shewing them some Calculations relating to the numbers of the
People of England, founded on somewhat like Records, and some to its gradual en|crease
in Trade as well as populousness, and others relating to other parts of
the World, whereby their Souls having somewhat like a new intellectual World
before them to expatiate in, might no longer be confined to a perplext
word.
Yet moreover considering how lately it was that they came out of that Con|juncture
of Panic fears, when so many who went to Bed without their Brains
were afraid of rising without their Heads, and that as our English World was
emerging out of the late general DELUGE of Fears and Iealousies where
omnia pontus erant, c. the Curious beheld the several births of Mens
Reasons attended with Imperfections like those of the Animals referr'd to;
 in his quaedam modo caepta per ipsum,
Nascendi spatium, quaedam imperfecta, suisque
Trunca vident humeris:  eodem corpore saepe
Altera pars vivit, rudis est pars altera tellus;
and thus saw the spectacles of mens various Vnderstandings gradually creeping
into sense and reason, and not suddenly likely to be perfected: I shew'd so
much Complaisance to them, as in stead of hastily removing their Thoughts
from the Course soil of Popery or the old Papal Vsurpations, to build my
Fabricks of Numbers and Calculations upon it: and I may say, that finding
their vitiated Fancies rellish'd nothing at that time grateful but the thoughts
about Popery, I then chose to make that the Vehicle of the Notions I meant
as Physick for their Cure.
According to the way of judging of the Draught and Proportion in perspe|ctive
Painting by their respect to the Eye being directed to the Center there|in,
any ordinary Reader's judgment will be carry'd by the Index to find what
was principally aim'd at in the following Discourse, namely to incline him to
preserve the haereditary Monarchy. And he will there find that my next aim to
that was in a great part of the Work to dispose those who formerly had been
diffident of their Prince, to Promote the Public Supplies for the necessary
Support of the Government. And my judging that our most eminent Patriots
would be inclined to value themselves as such, on the promoting the same,
may to some appear as the most sanguine part of my Predictions. But as I
leave it to any indifferent man to judge of the grounds of Nature I went on in
so doing, so I may some way support the Credit of my measures of futurity in
that Affair by the past event of the Loyal Confidence in His Majesty shewn
by his late Parliament in their proceeding so far as they did in Supporting the
Government; and may add that His Majesty's vast Expences that have been
since so Conspicuous to the World in his Naval Preparations, and otherwise in
the Providing for the Security and Honour of the Nation, may well incline any
one else to judge well of such Patriotly temper of any future Parliament, and
to allow of the Reasons by me urged as more Cogent for the present Reign then
the former, considering the Preparations of our Neighbors that have been
since augmented.
Yet however, I doubt not but that if it had been Gods will further to have
lengthen'd the last reign, the Course of Nature would then have operated as I

have mention'd. And if it shall appear that those natural Considerations I have ur|ged
shall have the success of such further Parliamentary Supplies to His gracious
Majesty, as may tend to the further greatning of his Character and that of the
Kingdom, I shall account my claim the more equitable to have the pardon of my
fellow Subjects of what Religionary Sect soever for any thing in this Discourse
that may disgust them. And, as an eminent Protestant Divine hath in a Printed
Sermon thus said, viz. that man is not worthy to breathe in so good a Land
as England is, who would not willingly lay down his life to cure the pre|sent
divisions and distractions that are among us, I shall say that any Subject
deserves not to live here under the Indulgence of so good a Prince, who for
the helping him to money by all due means for the defence of this good Land,
would not wish himself as well as his Bigottry a Sacrifice; and who would
not as to any Extravagant dash of a Pen lighting on his Party, and bringing Mo|ney
to his Prince, cry foelix peccatum, rather then such Divisions and Di|stractions
and Diffidences of the Government, and stifling of Publick Supplies
should still live as were formerly known in some Conjunctures, and when the Art
of Demagogues appear'd so spightful in endeavours to frustrate the Meetings of
Parliaments.
But our Prince having freed all his dissenting Subjects from their uneasi|ness
under Pecuniary Mulcts for Religion, and the Members of the Church of
England from the uneasiness of imposing such Soul-Money, will, I doubt not,
when he shall please to Call a Parliament, find from them such necessary Sup|plies
for the support of the Body of the Kingdom, as may ease him under the
weight of his great Desires for it: and that it will then appear to all as absurd
to Crown such a Head with Thorns as hath taken the Thorn out of
every man's foot in England: and that his pass'd Sufferings for his Con|science
(and others of his Communion having too suffer'd for his Conscience)
bespeaking us in those words of the Apostle, Fulfil ye my joy; that both his
and theirs will be then Consummated, and as the Ioy of those of the Church of
England, and of all nominal Churches in England hath been fulfill'd by him:
and that as Luther was pleas'd in a Christian-like transport of good Nature to
Profess in his Epistle to Jeselius a Iew, Me propter Unum Judaeum Cruci|fixum
omnibus favere Judaeis, we shall for the sake of one of the Roman-Catholick
Communion, who hath formerly suffer'd so much for his Conscience,
and since done so much for the freedom of ours, shew all those of that Com|munion
our favour to such a proportion as may compleat his and their Ioy.
My Lord, I am here obliged to acknowledge, that tho while the several
Parts of the following Work were written in the times the Government
charged both Papists and Anti-Papists with Disloyalty and Plots, I express'd
my sense of the Non-advisableness to have the Penal Laws against them re|peal'd,
pending such Charge and Plots; I desire the Reader to look on
me as very far from insisting on any thing of that nature in this Happy
State of England, now that the Corner Stone (and that some of the Buil|ders
rejected) hath thus successfully united the sides of the Fabrick of the
Government in Loyalty.
My Lord, It is near a year since I writ my Thoughts at large concerning
the Subject of the Repealing those Laws, and they are in the Fourth Part of
my Work about The Dispensative Power (of which the two first Parts con|clude
this Volume) ready for the Press; and reserving my poor Iudgment in
this great Point till the Publication of the whole, I think I shall then set
forth my Opinion as founded on Medium's that have not appear'd in Print from
other Writers, and which I believe will not only not give offence to any Mem|ber
of the Church of England, but be of general use in allaying the ferment
the Question hath occasion'd.

And if as they who were long fellow-Passengers in a Ship among violent
Tempests and Hirricanes, do usually from their being Participants together
in the danger and horror, take occasion to raise a friendly esteem and well|wishes
for each other, such of the Loyal whose belief I referr'd to, as im|barqued
with mine in that of the Plot during the late Stormy Conjuncture,
shall be the more favourable to what I write, I shall be glad both for their
sakes as well as mine; but do further judge that what I have so largely
in the following Discourse asserted (and by Reasons taken from Nature)
concerning the Moral impossibility of the belief of the Tenets of the Church
of Rome gaining ground here considerably, on the belief of the Doctrine
of the Church of England, will tend to secure any one from fears of our
losing our Religion by any loss of the Test that may happen: a thing that
none (I think) will fear, who are of the Iudgment of the House of Commons
in their Address to the late King on the 29th of November, 1680. (that I
have referr'd to in my Fourth Part) and where they say, that POPERY
hath rather gain'd then lost Ground since the TEST ACT, and make
that Act to have had little effect. I have in the following Discourse referr'd
to that Act as represented to have had its rice in the year 1673. from the
alledged petulant Insolence of Papists in that Conjuncture, and I took notice
of a learned Lord since deceas'd as vouching somewhat in Print of such tem|per
among some of them. And a Proclamation that year charging the Pa|pists
therewith, I was implicitly guided thereby to take the thing for gran|ted,
and as to the which, considering since the publick Passages in that Con|juncture,
I have otherwise judged. But as I think no loyal Roman-Catholick
should in that Conjuncture have suffer'd any Prejudice for any ill Behaviour
of any other of that Communion then, much less ought any such thing be
now; and when there appears so noble and general a spirit of Emulation
among all men of sense in the Diffusive Body of the People about who shall
make the Head and all Members of that Body most easie: and for the doing
which we may well hope that the People representative, and the other Estates
of the Realm will come with all due Preparation of Mind, when it shall please
His Gracious Majesty to assemble them.
My Lord, I have nothing further to add but my begging your Lord|ship's
Pardon for this trouble, and my owning the many Obligations I am
under to be,
My Lord,
Your Lordship's most Obedient
Servant,
P. P.




THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.
THE Earl of Anglesy having shewed me an Affidavit and In|formation
against him, delivered at the Barr of the House of
Commons, on the 20th of October 1680. and printed by
Order of that House, and in which Affidavit and Information
he was Charged with Endeavours to stifle some Evidence of the Popish
Plot, and to promote the belief of a Presbyterian one, and with encoura|ging
Dugdale to recant what he had sworn, and promising to harbour him
in his House, and that his Lordships Priest should there be his Companion
and likewise watch him, his Lordship being thereupon desirous that
right should be done him by a printed Vindication, was pleased to Com|mand
my Pen therein: and I was the less unwilling to disobey his Com|mands,
because in that Conjuncture wherein so many Loyal and Noble Per|sons
were sufferes by the humour of Accusation then regnant, I held it
a Patriotly thing to withstand its Arbitrariness.
Sir W. P. in an Excellent Manuscript of his, called, The Political Anato|my
of Ireland, hath one Chapter there, Of the Government of Ireland apparent
or external, and the Government internal: and he describes the apparent
Government there to be by the King and Three Estates, and with the Con|duct
of Courts of Iustice, but makes the internal Government there to
depend much on the Potent Influence of the many Secular Priests and
Fryars on the numerous Irish Roman Catholicks, and on those Priests and
Fryars being governed by their Bishops and Superiors, and on the Ministers
of Foreign States, governing and directing such Superiors: and thus while
England was blest with the best external Government, namely of Monar|chy,
and with the best Monarch and a Loyal Nobility and Commons, yet
after the detection of a Popish Plot, several Persons under the Notion of
Witnesses about the same, made so great a Figure in the Government,
and were so Enthroned in the Minds of the Populace, that the Office
of the King's Witnesses was as powerful as ever was that of the high Con|stable
of England, and the internal Government of the Kingdom was
then very much as I may say a Martyrocracy, and by that hard name the
Noisy part of Protestants Endeavoured to gain Ground as much as ever
any peaceable ones did by the old known Name of Martyrology.
But as all external Forms of Government have some peculiar defects
as well as Conveniences, so did this internal Government appear to have;
and those too so dreadful, that the Air of Testimony having sometimes
got into the wrong place, was likely to have made Earth-Quakes in the ex|ternal
Government: and as the Militia that after the Epoche of 41 was cal|led

the Parliaments Army, did before the fatal time of 48, produce the
Revolution of the Army's Parliament, so were we endangered after the
Plot-Epoche of 78, to have heard of the Office of the King's Witnesses
changed into another, namely, of the Witnesses Kings.
And whoever shall write the English History of that part of time where|in
that Martyrocracy was so powerful and domineering, will (if he shall
think fit to give a denomination to that Interval of Time, and to found
the same on most of the Narratives he shall read, or the Sham-Papers
that many Papists and Protestants after the Plot Attaqued each other
with,) be thought not absurd, if he gives the old Style of Intervallum
, incertum, or of  fabulosum.
It was in the time of the most Triumphant State of this Internal Govern|ment,
that I undertook to weigh its Empire, as I have done in p. 33, 34, 35.
discussing the points of Infamous Witnesses and their Infamy, and of their
Credibility after pardon of Perjury or Crimes and Infany incurred: and a
bolder man than my self would hardly have dared in that Conjuncture to
have sifted their Prerogative, and (as I may say) to have put hungry Wolves
into Scales, and to have taken the dimensions of the Paws of Lions, or to
have handled the stings of Serpents, without expressing against some of the
Romanists Principles he thought Irreligionary, all the zeal he thought consi|stent
with Charity and Candour to the Persons of Papists, which is so much
done in the Body of this Discourse, and without the expressing of which my
Vindicating a Noble Person from being a Papist, had been an absurdity.
However I have been careful in any Moot-points of Witnesses, not to
disturb in the least the Measures of the External Government about
them; and out of the tender regard due to the safety of Monarchs from
all Subjects, have in p. 205 asserted the Obligation of doing every thing
that is fairly to be done, to support the Credits of Witnesses produced in
the Case of Treason, and have there given a particular reason for it: and
have in p. 36. with a Competent respect mentioned Dugdale on the occa|sion
of the Shamm sworn against the Earl of Anglesy, as if his Lordship
had undertook to have unjustly patronized him: and have shewed my self
inclined enough to belief credible Witnesses, by the Concurrence of my
thoughts with the Iustice of the Nation in Godfrey's Case; and the fate of
which Person, and the Casuistical Principles that allowed it, I had per|haps
not mentioned, but out of a just indignation against the infamous
Shamms about it spread by some ill Papists to the dishonour of that Excel|lent
Lord the Earl of Danby.
But there was another consideration that induced me to write with
such a Zeal as aforesaid, against such Romanists Principles and their ef|fects;
and but for which the following Discourse had not swollen to a
large Volume.
I observed that since the late Fermentation in England, such a Panique
Fear of the Growth of Popery, and the numbers of Papists had been by
Knaves propagated among Fools that made the English Nation appear
somewhat ridiculous abroad, and that during its Course many consi|derable
Protestants were so far mis-led, as to think the State of the Na|tion
could never be restored to it self, but by disturbing the Succession of
the Crown in its lawful Course of Descent: and therefore resolving to do
my utmost to free the Land from the Burthen of another guess Perjury,
by the general Violence done to our Oaths Promissory (I mean to those of
Allegiance and Supremacy) then that of any Witnesses in their Oaths As|sertory,
I thought fit at large to shew the Vanity of any Mens fearing

that Popery can ever (humanly speaking) be the National Religion of
England; and to direct them that they may not, by the imaginary danger
of Popery to come, run with all their swelling Sails on the Rock of it at pre|sent,
by founding Dominion in Grace, and out-rage those Oaths that do at
present bind us without reserve to pay Allegiance to the King's Heirs af|ter
his demise.
And for any one who being concerned to see so many of his Country-men
lying (as it were) on the Ground, and dejected with unaccoun|table
fears of the extermination of their Religion and themselves, and be|smearing
themselves with the dreadful guilt of their great Oaths,
was resolved to endeavour to help them up, and by perswasion gently to
lead them to such a high Prospect of thought, from whence they might
at once have a view of the past and present State of Popery here and a|broad
in former Ages, and likewise of its probable future one, (a sight that
might better entertain Curiosity than what the Traveller speaks of, when
from a high Mountain in the Isthmus of America, he could view both
the great North and South Sea) not to have rendered himself an accep|table
Perswader by his Discourse carrying with it Self-Evidence that he
was no Papist, had been a vain attempt.
And again for any one who would perswade the generality of Popish
or Protestant Recusants, that it is not their Interest by any Artifices to
endeavour to make so great a Figure in the Internal Part of the Go|vernment
as they have in some former Conjunctures, without his Discourse
carrying likewise Self-Evidence, that his Advice was that of a Friend to
their Persons, as far as the publick Security would admit, had been an
attempt as insignificant as the former.
I have in this Discourse often took notice of this distinction of the Te|nets
of Popery and Presbytery: viz. Such of them that properly are de|nominable
by Religion, and such that are not: presuming in my private
judgment to differ from the Measures took by the Government in King
Iames his time, when the printed Prayers for the Anniversary of the
Gun powder Treason represented Papists Religion to be Rebellion; and I un|der
the Notion of Principles denominable by Religion have ranked Tran|substantiation,
Purgatory, Invocation of Saints, and others, and have
judged none of their Principles Irreligionary, but such as the late Learned
Earl of Clarendon in his incomparable defence of Dr. Stilling fleet attri|butes
to Popery, as injurious to Princes and their Subjects and what
King Iames in his Speech to both Houses, hinted as such (according to
what is cited by me p. 172) viz. As it is not impossible but many honest
men seduced with some Errors in Popery may yet remain good and faithful
Subjects, so on the other handnone that know and believe the Grounds and
School-Conclusions of their Doctrine, can ever prove good Christians or faith|ful
Subjects: and such as are apparently contrary to the Light and Law of
Nature.
But there is nothing in this Discourse otherwise than en passant, that
impugns or confutes the old Religionary Points controverted formerly
between the Church of England and that of Rome, and all the passages
throughout referring to those old points, might (I believe) be compri|zed
together in about a Page.
And if I were as in a Dictionary to express the sense of the words, Po|pery
and Irreligionary so often used in this Discourse, I would say that ge|nerally
by Poper, or (as the Writers in Latin call it, Papismus) I
mean the power of the Bishop of Rome, in imposing Ceeds and Doctrines

and Rules of Divine Worship on Men, and his Jurisdiction interloping in
that of Princes and their Laws, and the doing this by the Charter of
Ius Divinum, and as he is Christs pretended Vicar; and by the term of
Irreligionary of often by me applied to Principles, I sometimes mean such
as are barely NOT religionary, that is to say, Principles that are not in
truth and in the nature things, parts of Religion, whatever any Sanction
of the Papacy or a Presbytery may term them, and which do not religare
or bind the Soul to God by Moral Obligations, nor by any Band of Loyal|ty
to our Prince or Charity to our Neighbour, but do only tie men to a
Party and to the owning with them several points of speculation, and no more
necessary to be believed in order to our improvement in Moral Offices
that the Divine Law natural or positive enjoyns, or conducing to the same,
than are the Hypotheses of the old or new Philosophy.
But I most commonly apply the word Irrligionary to Principles that
are rever contrary to Religion, and Justice, and Morality, and such as I
would therefore dis-robe of the Name of Religion; and under this term
of Irreligionary not only all the Antimonarchical Principles of the Jesu|ites
and Presbyterians are properly to be reckoned, but those Principles
of the Papacy that even in the times of our Roman Catholick Ancestors,
(as I said) were so injurious to our Princes and their Subjects, and which
were by them as Vsurpations on the Crown opposed and defied, and espe|cially
by those of them who were in their tempers most Magnanimous:
and in this Case the Papal Principles that favoured those Vsurpations on
the rights of our Princes, might be said to be both Non-Religionary, or
things beside the matter of Religion, and likewise Irreligionary or con|trary
to Religion, as being unjust.
The Religio Officii (as Tully calls the Conscience one hath to do his du|ty)
did bind those Princes of the Pope's Religion, to impugne his Arbi|trary
Usurpations on their Realms: and in the Case of the meanest Cotta|ger
of England, the Pope's Excommunication was never allowed good in
Westminister-Hall under our Roman Catholick Kings.
The latter end of the very Reign of Queen Mary, was likely to have
diverted our English World with the sight of as remarkable a Prize play|ed
between the two Swords, (I mean the Pope's Spiritual and her Temporal
one) as was ever played on its Stage: and when Cardinal Pool her
Kindsman who had reconciled our Nation to Rome, was so far lost in the
Pope's good Graces, as that his Legantine Power was abrogated by the
Pope, and in affront to Pool given to Peito a poor Friar; but whose red
Hat by Queen Mary's opposition could get no further than Callis; and
She was so regardless of the Pope's Curses in the Case, that his Bulls
in favour of his new Legate were not permitted to Arrive here, and the
designed Legate was enforced to go up and down the Streets of London
like a begging Friar without a red Hat. And more need not be here said to
express the Principles that Usurp on Monarchs to be Irreligionary.
When I have in the former part of the Discourse once or twice men|tioned
the term of Apostates, for some turning to the Church of Rome,
I did there speak Cum vulgo, and likewise according to the Style of our
Courts Christian, which proceeding against some perverted to the Church
of Rome, impute to them the Crime of Apostacy: but having observed
in the Progress of this Discourse, that that term was seditiously used by
the Disciples of Iulian, I have reprehended the further calling any men
Apostates, for the alteration of their judgments in some controvertible points
of saith between Papists and Protestants, and that may without absurdity be
called Tenets of Religion.

As to the expression of the Extermination of Popery, and likewise of
Presbytery used in this Discourse sometimes, (and with allusion to the
trite term of the Papacy, viz. Exterminium haereticorum) I have there
in p. 283 sufficiently expressed my abhorrence of the Extermination of
Persons, and (as is there said) do only refer to the Extermination of
Things and Principles Religionary, and indeed to speak more properly of
that part of Mens Principles only that is Irreligionary and against Na|ture.
The words of exterminating and recalling are often used by Cicero as
signifying the contrary: and when Mr. Coleman's Letters shewed such an
imperious design in him for the Revocation of Popery that had been driven
away, and banished or exterminated hence by so many Acts of Parlia|ment,
and even for the Extermination of Heresie out of the North, as oc|casioned
such apprehensions in the Government of what was intended by
other innocent and modest Papists, that made the gentlest of Princes in a
Speech in the Oxford Parliament say, and if it be practicable the ridding our
selves quite of all of that Party that have any considerable Authority, c.
none need wonder at the past warmth of Subjects expressed against the
Recalling of the Exterminated Papal Power: nor yet at the warmth of
their Zeal against the Principles of the Iesuites, propagating an Internal
Power here when they had been exterminated from Rome it self: and
when the Lord Chancellors Speech to both Houses had mentioned the Pro|ceedings
against Protestants in Foreign Parts; to look as if they were in|tended
to make way for a general Extirpation.
They are poor Judges of things who think that Doctrines of Religion
cannot be said to be exterminated out of Kingdoms, and their Laws with|out
the Banishment of the Persons professing them. Who accounts not
Protestancy sufficiently exterminated from being the State-Religion in
Italy, and yet Sandies his Europae speculum tells us, That there were 40000
professed Protestants there. Is not Iudaism sufficiently Exterminated
from being the Religion at Rome, tho thousands of professed Iews are
there tolerated?
'Tis the publick approbation of Tenets or Doctrines, and not any for|bearance
or indulgence to persons who prosess them, that gives Doctrines
a place within the Religion of a State: for to make any State approve of a
Doctrine contrary to what it hath Established, is a Contradiction. But
the truth is, the famous Nation of the Iews (formerly Heavens peculiar
People on Earth) having not been more generally guilty of Idolatry du|ring
their prosperity, than of Superstition during their Captivity and Op|pression,
and Extermination from their Country, hath taught the
World this great truth that the readiest way to propagate Superstition,
and Error is by the Exterminium and Banishment of Persons.
Whatever Church any men call their Mother, if the Magistrate finds
them to own the Interest of their Country as their Mother, and to honour
their true Political Father, they cannot wish their days more long in the
Land than I shall do.
I remember under the Vsurpation there passed an Act of Parliament
(as 'twas called) for the banishment of that famous Boute-feu Iohn Lilburn:
and under the Penalty of the Vltimum supplicium, and he shortly af|ter
returning to England, and being tried in London where he was univer|sally
known, and the only thing issuable before the Iurors being whether
he was the same John Lilburn, those good men and true thought him so
much transubstantiated, as to bring him in not guilty: and when ever I

find any Papist not only willing to change the Name Papist for Catholick,
but the thing Papistry, for the Principles of the Church of Rome under
its first good Bishops, and before Popes beyond a Patriarchal Power aspi|red
to be Universal Bishops and Universal Kings, and that even a Iesuite
instead of the Rule of Iesuita est omnis homo, hath alter'd his Morals and
Principles pursuant to the Pope's said Decree, so far as truly to say, Ego
non sum ego, I shall not intermeddle in awakening Penal Laws to touch ei|ther
his life or liberty.
Nor can any Presbyterians with justice reflect on the Zeal of any for
the Continuance of the Laws, for the Extermination of Presbytery, when
they shall reflect on the Royal Family having been by their means (as is
set forth in this Discourse) exterminated out of the Realm into Foreign
Popish Countries: and of which they might easily have seen the ill effects,
if their understandings had not been very scandalously dull.
But there is another happy Extermination that I have in this Discourse
from Natural Causes predicted to my Country, and that is of the fears
and jealousies that have been so prevalent during our late fermentation:
concerning which the Reader will shortly find himself referred to in many
Pages in this Discourse, and to have directed him to all of that Nature
would have made the Index a Book.
I have in this Discourse designing to eradicate the fears of Popery out
of the Minds of timid Protestants, by the most rational perswasions I
could, shewed somewhat of Complaisance in sometimes humouring their
Suppositions of things never likely to come to pass. I have accorded with
them in the possibility of the Event of Arch-Bishop Vsher's Famous Prophecy,
tho I account the same as remote from likelihood as any one could with
it: and do believe that if that Great and Learned Man could have foreseen
the mischief that Prophecy hath occasioned by making so many of the
Kings good Subjects disquieted thereby, (and which by at once Chilling
their Hearts and heating their Heads, hath rendered them less qualified
for a chearful and steady discharge of their respective Duties) he would
have consulted privately with many other Learned and Pious Divines
about the intrinsick weight of the matter revealed to him, before he had
exposed it to the World: for that in the days when God spake by the Pro|phets,
yet even then the Spirits of the Prophets were always subject to the
Prophets: and there is no Fire in the World so bad a Master as the Fire
of Prophecy.
It is observable that there hath scarce since this Prophecy been a Con|juncture
of time wherein men uneasie to themselves would make the Go|vernment
so, but this Prophecy hath been reprinted in it and cryed about,
and few Enthusiasts but are as perfect in it as a Sea-man in his Com|pass.
The substance of it was to foretel Persecution that should happen in
England, from the Papists in the way of a sudden Massacre, and that the
Pope should be the Contriver of it, and that if the King were restored
it might be a little longer deferred.
A person less learned than that Great Prelate could easily give an Ac|count
of the past Out-rages of Massacres that have been perpetrated by
Papists, and of the tendency of the Iesuites Principles to the very legitima|ting
of Future ones: but the most Pious and Learned Man in the World
ought with the greatest Caution imaginable to pretend to Divine Revela|tion
of Future Contingencies, in a matter both so unlikely and so odious
as this, and which might probably occasion so much Odium to so many

innocent Papists, and so much needless trouble to so many timid Prote|stants.
That Pious and Great Prelate did not (I believe) foresee that at the
time when his Prophecy should dart its most fearful influence, St. Peter's
Chair would be filled with a Person of so great Morality and Vertue as
the present Pope is, and a Pope that would brand the sicarious Principles
of those Ianizaries of former Popes, the Jesuites, and that he would be
by so many Roman Catholicks called the Lutheran Pope, and that the Pa|pists
numbers would be here so comparatively small long before this
time, as to render it absurd to think that without the Execution of Hea|vens
Peanal Law of an infatuation upon them, they will ever attempt any
such desperate design against such vast Numbers protected by the best
of Princes under the best of Governments.
Whatever Principles of Irreligion any particular dissolute Papists might
by any be supposed to retain, it is not to be supposed but that they who
shew respect enough to Numbers and their weight in spiritual Matters,
and particularly in the Divine Concourse with the Majority of Numbers
in the Election of the head of their Church, and in the determinations of
a General Council, and in their valuation of their Church by its Universa|lity,
will not contemn the power of Numbers in Matters Political; and
I believe it will never among their innumerable Miracles and Revelati|ons
be Revealed to them, that numbers are by them in things Political
to be dis-regarded.
But as I observed of Mr. Hooker's Prophecy in this Discourse, viz. That
he guessed shrewdly: so one thing hath happened that may partly salve
the Credit of this Prelate's Conjecture: And that is, that some Nominal
Protestants (but too justly to be thought Popishly affected) having rob|bed
the Jesuites of their Doctrine of Resistance and of their Principle of Do|minion
being founded in Grace, Endeavoured to robb them of their Massa|cre,
and as his Majesty's Declaration of Iuly the 28th, 1683 mentioned,
did plot an execrable Out-rage of that kind: and some of the Dissenters
that appeared to me for sometime after I began this Discourse, only as
Sheep straying from the Flock, as they did to that Great Minister of the
State who bestowed on them that expression, were afterward turned ra|venous
Animals: and as the effect of Nycippus's Sheep according to
Aelian bringing forth a Lion in one of the Greek States, was resented as por|tending
a Change of the Government, these mens producing the Princi|ples
of the Iesuites, was to be much more regarded as an Omen of our Fu|ture
Mischief than what any former predictions could import, and it was
shortly accompanied with a real design to have effected it: and as I hope it
will be with such a sense of shame in others of them when they shall survey
the Circumstances of that bloody design notified in the King's Declara|tion,
as Mr. Iohn Geree an Eminent and Learned Presbyterian Minister of
S. Faiths in London did express, in a Dedicatory Epistle before a Book of
his called , published some Weeks before the Fate of the Royal
Martyr, and in which Epistle he importunes the Lady Fairfax to shew
the Book to her Husband then Lord General to prevent his participating
in the guilt of the Regicide then feared, and saith, O Madam let us fit
down and weep over our Religion, and we, whither shall we cause her shame to
go. How shall we now look Papists in the Face, whom we have so reviled
and abhorred for their Derogatory Doctrine and Damnable Practices against
Kings or any in Supreme Authority? O study that it may never be said that
any Person of Honour and of the Protestant Religion had any hand in so un|worthy

worthy an Action as the deposing and destroying of a King whose preservation
they stand bound to endeavour by so many Sacred Bonds.
I have accorded with our timid Protestants, that Popery may gain ground
perhaps in some turbid Interval, and how by the Divine Omnipotence and
Iustice, the Course of Nature in its continuing the Protestant Religion may
be over-ruled, and that on the account of our having justly deserved the Vi|sitation
of Popery, we may reasonably apprehend the dangers of it, p. 140.
but have never recurred from shewing them the Future prosperous
Estate of Protestants and Protestancy in England, but to advance the
more forward into the following Representations thereof.
But having thus with Compassion to the timid endeavoured to discharge
my duty as to the Moral Obligation of Complaisance (an Obligation that
Mr. Hobbs hath so well shewn to be most clearly rising from the Law of
Nature, and which the Christian Doctrine so strongly inculcates, and by
vertue of which we are to bear one anothers Burthens, and sometimes to
the weak to become as weak) I thought it afterward proper by the strength
of Argument desumed from the nature of things to fortifie the minds of
the Loyal against Un-Christian and Un-manly Fears.
But as to the Dis-loyal and Factious, let them (by my consent) fear
on. I shall not trouble my self to bear the burthens of them who resolve
to be Burthens to the Government, and who would if they could, load it
with Presbyteries dead-weight, while they give that term to our Bishops.
Let those who would have both Protestant Princes and their other Sub|jects
fear them, be laughed at for fearing of Papists, and for not having
a better understanding with the Persons of Papists, when there is so good
an understanding and coincidence between the Principles of such Nomi|nal
Protestants, and that very part of the Principles of some Papists that
is Irreligionary and subversive of the Rights of Princes and their Govern|ments,
and when yet they seem not to understand that; and let Papists
(by my consent) afford themselves recreative smiles, if ever in any
Conjuncture of time that may come, they shall behold the Factious Revi|lers
of the Church of England, to come under its Wing for shelter after
their so long endeavouring to deplume it.
But because I have observed some well meaning and loyal Dissenters,
frighted both by Cholerick and Melancholy Expositions of the Apocalypse
(a good Book in which some ill men have found the obscurest passages to
be the clearest for their ill purposes, and in the dark places of which Book
many having long lain in Ambush, have thence sallied out to cut Throats,
and subvert Governments, I have here rear'd up a Bull-wark of Nature,
that may secure them from the imaginary dangers of Castles in the Air,
or Visionary Armies in the Clouds of any Mens fancies: and in compassi|on
to the Loyal Protestants of the Church of England, whose Melancholy
Suppositions I had a while closed with both as a Friend and Wrestler, that
I might give them a fair and soft fall, I thought it then proper to warn
them of the danger of extravagant Suppositions, and acquainted them
that most Bedlams were founded on Suppositions, and the thought of
Quid si caelum ruat, and of Peoples imagining Earth-quakes to happen in
the State from falling Skies: and have shewn them how irrational a
thing it is to suppose that a lawful Prince, how unlawful or heterodox
any of his Tenets in Religion may be, will injure his Laws and the Reli|gion
by Law Established: and having conducted the Reader through the
former more melancholy and strait and unpleasant passages in the Fabrick
of this Discourse, have took care to lodge him in a more Airy and Cheer|ful

appartment, and whence he may recreate himself with looking out on
the Future State of England, and remain assured that no frightful Spectrums
and Fantoms will disturb him there, when he is either at his Rest or at
his Devotions, and which I have for his diversion furnished with some
such fair Pictures of his Countries Future State as may perhaps not much
either shame it or my self, in regard that I think in the draught and de|sign
thereof, my Art has been according to Nature, how carelessly laid
soever the Colours may have been, and where he moreover will have the
Prospect I before described, and if his sight be clear, will find the Sky so
more and more, tho so many Politick and Lachrymist would-be's have
told him of the contrary.
I believe that since the Predictions of the deluge by Noah to the old
World, there were never so many angry Predicters and Predictions of a
general inundation of misery to any Country, under a Future Prince,
as within these late years we have been overwhelmed with, and that to
the discomposing of mens minds in their common converse and while they
did eat and drink as in the days of Noah, and were so ready to devour
all their Countrymen who believed not the same inundation with
them.
But during this great Deluge of our popular fears of one of Popery,
I have ventured in p. 297 and 258 of this Discourse, to express my pre|sension
of the Future State of England making men ashamed of their past
fears and their former deference to ill boding Prophets, and that our Me|lancholy
Prophets will appear to be toto Caelo mistaken in their Auguries
as much (as Gassendus tells us) all the Astrologers were in France when by
reason of the great Conjunction of watry signs in Piscis and Aquarius in the
Year 1524, they said that there should be then in the Month of February
a second Deluge that should overwhelm France and Germany, and by
reason whereof many People went with their Goods and Cattel from the low
Lands to the hilly Country, and yet after all the frmentation those Astro|logers
had made among the Populace in France, that Month of February
(as Gassendus tells us) tho naturally rainy, proved the dryest Month
that ever was known in those Countries.
I account that the deluge of the popular fears did sensibly decrease after
the year 81, and that to the great dissatisfaction of those whose broken
Fortunes made them no worse under it, than the Fishes were in Noahs. The
more rational and sagacious sort of Protestants, who had been so long Sea|sick
with that deluge, and did nauseate the fears and jealousies that had dis|composed
them, began to see Land, when his Majesty with so just a Caution
advised them in his Speech to the Oxford Parliament, That their just care of
Religion should be so managed, as that unnecessary fears should not be made a
pretence for changing the Foundations of the Government, and his Declaration
of the Causes that induced him to dissolve that Parliament, signifying his
Royal Resolution both in and out of Parliament to use his utmost endeavours
to extirpate Popery, and in all things to Govern according to the Laws of the
Kingdom, was in effect, like the Olive-branch brought by the Dove into the
Ark, an happy indication of peace and settlement to the minds of the people
and of the Waters being abated, and indeed a demonstration to them that
the Dove had found ubi pedem figeret, and that our Laws and Religion
had done so too: and on that great Vision of the Lex terrae, that so many
mists had so long kept us from seeing, there ensued a general shout of
Loyal Addressers throughout the Kingdom, like that of Sea-mens at their
first seeing of Land after a long stormy Voyage, and when they thought

they had lost their Course: and the hearing of those shouts from the se|veral
Countries, served as a Call of invitation to the many Timid and
Loyal, and likewise to many unfortunate persons, to return thither after
they had flocked from thence to the Metropolis as an Ark for their preser|vation
on the rising of the deluge of fears in some preceeding years: and
it served to some clan and to other unclean Beasts as a Call of Nature that
they were to March out of the Ark.
By the unclean Beasts I mean the sturdy Paupers that I have in this
Discourse spoke of, who were observed shortly after the Alarms of the
Plot from so many Proclamations, to flock from so many parts of the Coun|try
to London, like the Rustical Plebs I have spoke of naturally thronging
to the shore, when they see a poor Vessel contending with a violent Tem|pest
near it, and the next Minute likely to Condemn it as a wrack, and
furnish them with Gods Goods (I mean such as they call wrack'd ones)
and when to prevent the Owners of them from the benefit of some co|ming
alive to the Shoar, they are so ready to out rage those forlorn Mar|riners
they see swimming to Land.
Many such Atheistical Ruffians of all Religionary Sects (and who
had been desperate in the Country) might, being come to the Metropo|lis,
there probably feed themselves with vain hopes of mischief to be done
to or by some particular persons, and would probably have been ready
enough to be Mercenary Bravo's to either any Iesuites or fifth-Monarchy
men or the Jesuited Protestant Patrons of the Doctrine of Resistance.
But this Scum of the Country was afterward as naturally thrown off from
the well governed City, as are the Purgamenta Maris from the Shoar
without making any Heads or Arms ake to remove them, and not find|ing
more welcome harbour in the City than they had in the Country,
were I believe litterally thrown upon the Sea to Convey them to the
Asylum of the Malheureus that we may call our Foreign Plantations: and
of the great and extraordinary Glut of the Advenae from the Country
ceasing in London after the year 1681, the yearly general Bills of Morta|lity
gave a sufficient proof, and did (as I may say) include too the Burial
of the Plot, or at least of the popular fears of danger from it.
The critical Observator on the Bills of Mortality having long since
told us, That there come about 6000 yearly out of the Country to live in
London, and which swells the Burials about 200 yearly, and likewise
taught us the Rule of 1 in 30 there yearly dying, I have in p. 155 Calcu|lated
by the yearly great encrease of the Burials from the Year 1675,
(when the fears of the Growth of Popery were so much in fashion) how
very great the encrease of the number of the living there was to the
Year 1679 inclusive, and the extraordinariness of which encrease was so
justly imputable to that of the Advenae from the Country: and to which
it may be added, that the Burials from what they were in the Year 79
(viz. 21730) falling back about 700 in the Year 80, yet in the Year
1681 were in all 23971, and so for every Thousand gradually dying more
in those Years referred to, 29000 were supposed to have in the same gra|dually
lived more than in the former: and all which years before men|tioned
were of ordinary health.
But the Year 1681 having produced that Pacific Royal Declaration,
and the Congratulatory Addresses thereupon, and likewise that encrease
of the Burials before mentioned (that might be supposed to happen part|ly
by the Advenae from the Country being for some time necessarily de|tained
in the Metropolis, in making preparations there to leave it, and by

some of them in the mean time dying, and partly from some new Pupers
then coming from the Country to hide their heads in obscure places in
London, and which they durst not shew in the Sun-shine that Declaration
had made in the Country, and partly by the deaths of many Loyal Persons
in London whom the Addresses and expectations of Preferment for their
Loyalty brought thither) yet the Burials in the following year, viz.
1682, being but 20690, was a considerable indication of the abatement
of the popular fears which led so many timid Persons from the Country,
with hopes to find our Metropols to be the most quiet part of the Nation,
as the most quiet part of a Ship is naturally that which is nearest the
Main-mast: and the Burials in the year 83 being but 20587, gave an
indication of the Advenae from the Country not then encreasing: and
although the Total of the Burials for this year 84 was 23202, yet it be|ing
most probable that there dyed above 3000 of Infants, and of Aged,
and infirm, and indigent People by the Accidents of the extraordinary
Frost, it may be well accounted that the popular fears have not been in
this year augmented.
Altho during the so long continuance of the general ferment in the
Kingdom after the Plot-Epoche, (and in which interal so great a part of
the following Discourse was printed Sheet by Sheet) I could not after
the King and Pope had both of them by written Edicts (as it were)
denounced War against the Tenets of the Iesuites, that included so much
Hostility to the Church of Rome as well as of England, but participate
in the general heat against those Tenets, and improve the occasion of
writing polemically about the same, yet I think none could more careful|ly
observe the Laws of Military Discipline, than I have those of Loyalty
in not going beyond the Measures of the Government, and in following
the Standard of the Royal Pen, set up in the Proclamations, and likewise
in the Declaration aforesaid.
Dr. Donne dedicating his Pseudo-Martyr to King Iames, begins his
Epistle by saying, that as Temporal Armies consist of pressed men and vo|luntaries,
so do they also in this War-fare in which your Majesty hath ap|peared
by your Books: and not only your strong and full Garrisons, which
are your Clergy and your Vniversities, but also obscure Villages can Mini|ster
Souldiers, c. Besides since in the Battel your Majesty by your Books
is gone in person out of the Kingdom, who can be exempt from waiting on you
in such an expedition.
That Learned Monarch in his printed Premonition to all Crowned Heads,
free Princes and States, doth Magno Conatu, go about to prove the Pope
to be Anti-Christ, and very subtilly discusseth the Moot-points out of the
Apocalypse that refer to it: and from that one word of Anti-Christ, the
Papacy hath since the Reformation received much more prejudice, than
hath the Reformation from that other famous word of Heresy: and the
Compellation of Anti-Christ is especially a more terrible weapon against
the Pope, when used by the hand of a King.
But I must frankly say should my Prince Combat the Pope with this
name in Print, and descend to Command my poor Service in that War|fare,
I should humbly apply to him to excuse me therein: and as it was
observed concerning Aretine, that he left God untouched in his Satyrs,
giving this reason for it, Ille inquit non mihi notus erat: so I shall say the
same thing of Anti-Christ.
But when the Thunder of the Royal Power was in so great a number
of Proclamations heard all over Christendom against particular persons,

and their known Principles and Designs, his Subjects might well think
it a part of Loyalty during that time to wear Clouds in their Brows, and
to be tributary to the Royal Cares by endeavouring in their several Ca|pacities
to support the Throne, and to concur with the constant Practice
of Nations in receiving the beliefs of Matter of Fact as stated by Soveraign
Power according to the common saying of Imperatori seu Regi aliquid at|testanti
plen creditur.
It is this Teste of the Sovereign (as I may say with allusion to the
words in our Writs of teste me ipso) that will be the Clew to the Histo|rians
to guide them in that dark and intricate Labyrinth of time, I be|fore
spoke of: and will probably be helpful to any ingenious Protestants or
Papists who shall write its History, when they shall from the many Col|lections
of the Pamphlets relating to that time treasured up by the curious,
see so many bold and contradictory Shamms and Affidavits fighting with
each other for that belief in a Future Conjuncture, that they could not
obtain in the past: and 'tis nothing but the declared Sense of the Govern|ment
that in such odiosa materia, will qualifie a judicious Historian to do
right to himself or his Reader, or even to his History, and keep it from
being thrust down among Narratives.
It may be rationally supposed that when Princes and their Ministers do
think fit to notifie their judgments of some matter of Fact wherein they
might receive the first Information from Persons lyable to exception, that
there were many concurrent Circumstances lay in the Balance before
them: and which perhaps they might not think convenient to divulge:
and moreover it is a thing commonly observable, that Divine Providence
doth influence the understandings of Princes (who are its instruments
in the Government of the World) more signally than of other men,
and that Crowned Heads are still blessed in some measure as of old by ano|ther
Spirit coming on them, than what animated them while private per|sons,
and that therefore their asserting of Facts of State is more to be re|vered
than that of other men.
I therefore in the Case of the shamm of throwing the Odium of a Plot
upon Protestants in one particular Conjuncture, have not come short of
or gone beyond the Measures of the Government: nor do I believe that
any Historian of it will.
And when I did read the various Pamphlets, and did confer Notes with
some of the Curious about the last mentioned Shamm, and participated
with the Loyal Protestants in their Concern and Sollicitude for the honour
of their Religion thereby attacqued, yet I gave no Rule about the Merits
of the matter in my private thoughts, till I saw in the Prints the Copy
of the Order of Council of November 2d, 1679. reflecting on the Trea|sonable
Papers thrown into a Gentleman's Chamber, by which divers
Noblemen and other Protestants, were to be brought under a suspicion of
carrying on a Plot against his Majesty, and which Order was after a Per|son
was sent to Newgate by the Council for forging of Letters im|porting
High-Treason and fixing the same in a Gentlemans Chamber,
and o which Forgery I yet thought none but some few of the faex Romu|li,
who believed and practised the Jesuites Doctrine of Calumny could pos|sibly
be guilty.
But I presently accordd in my thoughts with the many Loyal Prote|stants
and Papists who judged another Effort, that pretended to be of
the same Nature with the former, and referred to a Plot of Protestants,
to be a poor vile Artifice or Shamm, projected by some Calumnious Anti-Papists,

a shamm too despicable to be here named, and obvious enough
to detection from the Trite saying, That they who can hide can find.
But the many pitiful Shamms, whose humming noise did a while please
our Mobile, and were below the notice of the Government, have had
their triduum insecti, and are not to expect to live in Story, or to be there
Entombed like the Fly in Amber.
The powerful Effects of the Royal Declaration, freeing our Land from
the Plague of Fears and Jealousies and the Annoyance of the Swarms of
these Flies, as Moses his intercession prevailed to deliver a Realm from the
Judgments of other ones, will be a more adequate Subject to a great
Writers thoughts, and especially when he shall consider that in the Course
of Nature and without Miracle, those great Effects could not but
rise from so great an Efficient: and as to which any one will perhaps be
of opinion with me, who shall consider that the most terrible of terribles
in so many mens apprehension of Popery is its arbitrariness: and that
therefore the publication of the Royal Resolution to govern according to
the Laws would effectually secure us against all Arbitrary Power what|soever.
Mr. Hobbs saith in his Behemoth, I confess I know very few Controver|sies
among Christians of Points necessary to Salvation. They are the Que|stions
of Authority and Power over the Church or of Profit, or of Honour
to Church-men, that for the most part raise all the Controversy. For what man
is he that will trouble himself or fall out with his Neighbours for the saving
of my Soul, or the saving of the Soul of any other than himself?
And no doubt it is not barely any mens believing the Doctrines of Pur|gatory
or Trasubstantiation, or Merit or Works of Super-Errogation, that
hath made the past ferment among us, but the Arbitrariness of the Papal
Power and the Complication of the Tenet of the Plenitude of that Power
with those Religionary Tenets, and the making of it Penal not to re|ceive
those or other Tenets from Rome, and the making men Tenants
in capite, to a Foreign Head for their Brains and Estates, and an outland|ish
Bishop, who lives a Thousand Miles off, with new Non obstantes outra|ging
their old Laws, and whom they can never see blush after it.
But his Majesty having declared, That he would use his Royal En|deavours
both in and out of Parliaments to Extirpate Popery, (of which
its Arbitrariness was its great dreaded part) and in all things to Govern ac|cording
to the Laws of the Realm, the People knew that the Laws had
sufficiently provided against Appeals to Rome, as well as against Appeals
from the Country to the City, and that Declaration naturally fortified the
minds of the People as a Praemunimentum, guarding them before hand (as
I may say with allusion to our Statutes of Praemunire) against the Arbi|trary
Power either of Rome or Geneva, and did in effect set up an Ensu|rance
Office in each of his Majestie's Courts of Iustice, to secure them
against Arbitrary Power as such in whomsoever, and that they might in
in utramvis aurem dormire as to any danger from the same; and 'tis there|fore
no wonder that the Reflux of People from the Metropolis to the
Country ensued thereupon, as I have remarked out of the Bills of Mor|tality:
and from which Bills perhaps we may divert our selves with the
sight of the Burial of that Plot, which some feared and others hoped
would have been immortal, who would have had it Entailed too on their
Heirs and Successors, tho they would not allow the Crown to be so to the
Royal Line.

The Political uses that the Bills of Mortality may be put to, being
more various than the profound Observator on them took the pains to
mention, as I have thence, by a glancing view of the gradual Encrease of
the People, coming out of the Country for several years, to dwell with|in
the Compass of those Bills, and likewise of the gradual decrease thence
deduced, given an account of what I thought might in some measure
deserve the name of an Indication of the diminution of the popular fears
resulting from the Burials, after the great auspicious year of the Royal
Declaration, so I could, in order to the lessening of the fears of the en|crease
of Dissentership within the Circuit of those Bills, from the Total
of the Christenings in the respective years since that of 81, give what I
might without Vanity call more than Indicium, and which perhaps
would be by Critical Persons allowed for somewhat like a Demonstration
of the Encrease of the Numbers there, (as I may say) born into the
Church of England, and to what proportion, and that very particularly:
and make it out thence that above the proportion between the Burials
and Christenings that was in the Year 81, there were Christened 1084 in
the year 82, and that the disposition of People for baptizing their Chil|dren
in the way of the Church of England did encrease near a 13th part,
in the year 82, and that above the proportion between the Burials and
Christenings that was in the year 82, there were in the year 83 Christen'd
2146, which is near a 6th part, that the Baptizing of Children in the
way of the Church of England hath gained, and Dissentership hath lost
ground in that year.
Nor do I find cause to alter my opinion of such baptizing in the way of
the Church of England, having lost, but rather, on the contrary, gained
ground in this year 84, tho to what proportion I cannot positively judge,
by reason of what I before hinted, namely, of the extraordinary propor|tion
of the Burials this year, arising from the Accidents of the great
Frost, and which Physicians by comparing the encrease of the particular
Diseases by which so many died this year more than in the former hap|pening
from those Accidents, have judged to be considerably above 3000,
and likewise by reason of the Births having this year been rever consi|derably
fewer, according to the Rule of the Observator on those Bills,
That the more sickly the year is, it is the less fertile of Births.
All who have been in the least conversant with those Observations of
his, know that the Births in ordinary years are equal to the Burials, or
rather more: and I have observed the same from the Paris Bills, where
the Christenings do generally much exceed the Burials (and as particular|ly
appeared by the Total of the Burials in the year 1683 being 17764,
and the Total of the Christenings being 19717) but by the Christenings
among us registred and reckoned in our Bills, we know thence when the
disposition of the People to baptize their Children in the way of the
Church began to encrease, and Dissentership consequently to decrease;
and accordingly the ground gained by the Church of England, and lost
by Dissentership within the Compass of those Bills, after the year 81,
hath been by me sufficiently proved, Quod erat demonstrandum.
I have in this Discourse given somewhat like a little Historical Account
of the Numbers of the Papists, since the Reformation to our late Con|juctures,
and have with honour mentioned the Vigilance of his Maje|sty's
late Minister, the Earl of Danby, in directing a Survey of the Num|bers
of the People of several Religionary Perswasions in the Province
of Canterbury, and which was returned in the year 76, and whereby

the Comparative Paucity of the number of Papists there is apparent, as it
is by themselves agreed on so to be, as I have cited out of the Compen|dium.
But tho the Copy of that Survey is in the hands of so many Persons,
I would not have mentioned any thing thereof as to the Number of the
Papists, but that Dr. Glanvill had first published the same, and whose Book
I have referred to for the same. Nor shall I therefore give any particular
account of the numbers of the Non-Conformists resulting from the same.
But tho I think that the Number of the Non-Conformists was not re|turned
perhaps in that Survey, so justly and near the matter as was that
of the Papists, yet I am fully of opinion that if the number of Non-Conformists
were thrice as great as that returned (which I believe no
man will reckon it to be) their proportion with that of the Total of
this great Populous Nation would be very inconsiderable.
But as to all the Writers or Discoursers of their proportion to that To|tal
that I have conversed with, (and who have rendered the Quota of
the Dissenters so vast with much positiveness) I am able to say, That
I have easily perswaded them to desist from any positive magisterial de|termination
therein, by shewing them that their measures of the Total of
the People of England have been but conjectural, and depending perhaps
on some Calculations too fine and subtle, or others too course and gross,
and that no man can be a competent Judge of this Total, who hath not
seen the Returns on the Bishops Survey, and likewise the Returns on the
late Pole-Bills, and of which latter under the Patronage of a powerful
Minister of the Kings, I obtained Copies, and have thence in the follow|ing
Discourse shewed the Total of the People of England and Wales, to
be probably much greater than any cautious Calculators have made it,
and some whereof made the Total to be 5, others 6, others 7 Millions.
I thought the doing of this an acceptable service to my Prince and
Country, and the rather for that several Authors among the Magna nomi|na
have published it in Print, that the People of England and Wales are
but 2 Millions: and which number if they did not exceed, we might
allow our Dissenters a considerable proportion therein, tho yet nothing
near so great even as to such a Total as some would have it.
But the Ebb of their Numbers is at this time so apparent, if we respect
the State of them in the whole Kingdom, that their Out-cry of Implevi|mus
omnia, and The Nation and its Trade cannot subsist without us, is very
ridiculous: and they are not in my opinion their friends who writing for
them do so customarily magnify their Numbers, and as if they were half
the People of England, as some have done: and I believe the Gentleman
whom I have cited for saying in a late Parliament, that he observed,
That in the Choice of Knights of the Shire for the County he lived in,
that they could not bring one in twenty to the Field, would if he had been
at Elections in some other Counties have found they could not there bring
in so great a number.
And tho the Puritans of old were very numerous in the House of Com|mons,
and our Dissenters in the King's long Parliament made so great a
Figure as to be able by their weight to crush the Declaration for Indul|gence,
yet in the succeeding Houses of Commons, the Dissenters were far
from valuing themselves an their weight or numbers: but of the Dissen|ters
in that Loyal Long Parliament, I believe there were not any who
wished for the Yoke of Presbytery, or thought its Platform practicable
in this Realm.

I have in this Discourse mentioned one thing, that made the most Emi|nent
Presbyterian Divines after 41, think their bringing of the Yoke of
Presbytery upon the English Necks practicable, and that is, their ac|counting
according to the Pacta conventa between Them and the Parlia|ment,
they should have the Bishops and Deans and Chapters Lands settled
on their Church, whereby their Discipline how defective soever in weight
as to Principles of Divinity and Humanity, would have made it self or|midable
by its Balance of Land: and 'tis probable, that in Scotland the
Livings of the inferiour Clergy weighing more in value than the Estates
or Livelihoods of the ordinary inferiour Layety, hath supported that
Clergy there in their pretences to expect somewhat of Power, and which
they yet enjoy in the Figure of the Church Government there Establish|ed
under Bishops: and altho King Iames in his planting so many Be|nefices
throughout that Kingdom, worth 30 l. per Annum, with a House
and some Glebe Land belonging to them, never intended any advantage
to Presbytery thereby; he yet occasioned some by making so many Di|vines
there more considerable in wealth: but our Presbyterian Divines
here having been so fatally disappointed about the Bishops Lands promi|sed
them, all ingenious men must necessarily thereby be made apprehen|sive
that they are never to hope to bring the terror of that Church Go|vernment
upon us by that means.
It is moreover observable that most of the Race of our old Presbyterian
and Independant Divines having been extinct, (some few of whom were
Learned Men and gave some Ornament to their Tenets by their Learn|ing)
scarce any new ones, and who appeared not in the Church before
the King's Restoration, have since by the publication of any Theological
or DevotionalWritings propp'd up the Credit of their Party, and that
of the Ecclesiasticks of those perswasions none have published any thing
valuable against Popery but some of their old stock.
Tho some Presbyterians have not hitherto learned that Modesty and Po|licy
from the Papists, as to leave off their unjust valuing themselves on
their Numbers, yet as I know not of any number of Gentlemen that
would choose to live in any Parish in England under the severity of that
Church Government, and who would not rather desire to be extermina|ted
from their Native Country than to live in it with Presbytery Para|mount,
so neither do I believe, that Presbytery would be endured by
many of our illiterate Mechanicks now more than heretofore, if they
were taught its rigour.
And tho likewise another Sect of Dissenters more Gentlemanly than
that of the Presbyterians, I mean the Independants, do in the little Pam|phlets
they write, trouble us much with proclaiming their Numbers, and
as if they were not only the sober but the major part of the Nation, they
are very ridiculous in trying to make themselves that way dreadful con|trary
to what is in Fact true.
I believe that the number of those who in the late times listed them|selves
in the particular gathered Churches, and subjected themselves to
their Laws, and Contribution to their Pastorage, was always inconsidera|ble;
and as an Argument, of that 'tis in this Discourse mentioned that
the Pastors of the most Opulent of those Churches in London did most
readily quit their Posts, when they could obtain Head-ships of Colleges,
and that in a Conjuncture when Independancy was in a manner the form
of Church Government owned by the State.

These Churches were always very few in the Country and are now
fewer and scarce visible, unless we will call the Bands of Quakers by the
name of Churches, and a name I do not hear they think fit to use.
I am of opinion that under the Christian Religion so much uller of
Mystery than the Pagan, Iewish, and Turkish, its Divine Planter did ne|cessarily
make Christians loving one another, the Characteristical Mark of
their being such; and under the noble freedom allowed by the Prote|stats
Religion to try all things, and to trust no Religionary Tenets but
what they have tryed, a Heterodoxy as to some speculative supposed Te|nets
of the Church of England, may among some inquisitive persons have
long gained ground, and still do so.
There was in London an Independant Church under Cromwel's Govern|ment,
and Mr. Biddell was their Pastor, and among other Tenets deno|minable
as those of Religion, they owned these following, viz. That the
Fathers under the old Covenant had only Tempral Promises; and That the
Vniversal Obedience performed to the Commands of God and Christ was the
saving Faith; and That Christ rose again only by the Power of the Father and
not his own; and That justifying Faith is not the pure gift of God, but may be
acquired by mens natural Abilities; and That Faith cannot believe any
thing contrary to, or above reason; and That there is no Original Sin; and
That Christ hath not the same body now in glory in which he suffered and
rose again; and That the Saints shall not have the same body in Heaven
that they had on Earth; and That Christ was not Lord or King before his
Resurrection, or Priest before his Ascension; and That the Sains shall not
before the day of Iudgment enjoy the Bliss of Heaven; and That God doth
not certainly know Future Contingences; and That there is not any Authority
of Fathers or General Councils in determining Matters of Faith; and That
Christ before his death had not any Dominio over the Angels; and That
Christ by dying made not satisfaction for us: and 'tis possible that such Re|ligionary
Tenets as these, which are far from being de lan caprin, and
are contrary to the Articles of our Church may not be extirpated: tho
yet I believe there will never be any Fermentation in our Church or State
produced here by them, if in course of time any of them should hap|pen
to be the Sentiments of any of our Princes: and much less that any
Prince, if so opining, would consute others as Hereticks with Fire and
Sword, and as Calvin cofuted Servetus.
There was likewise in our Metropolis another Independant Church,
of which Mr. Iohn Goodwin was the Pastor, and by which Church the Te|nets
of Arminis were received, and which tho they have ceased to
ferment the State, yet the opinions of men equally pious and learned will
in all likelihood be always different about the same: and as to these Te|nets,
the Questions are not such as are called Questiones Domitianae, or of
catching of Flies.
But there is a sort of Questions that is little better, and that in our busie
World will not usurp the time they have done, and that is, such as are of the
Nature of that I have spoke of toward the Close of this Discourse, that
made the fermentation in a Church of Separatists that went hence to Am|sterdam,
namely, Whether Aron's Ephod were blew or Sea-green: and tho
I have asserted it That mens liberty of professing Religionary Tenets may
be reckoned as a part of their Purchace by Christ's Blood; yet methinks
to make the Son of God leave the Bosom of his ather, and take a Journey
from Heaven to Earth to impress on it right Notions about the lawfulness
of signing Children with the Cross, or of mens kneeling at the Sacrament, or

standing at the Creed, or bowing at the name of Iesus, or of placing the
Communion Table in the East, or of wearing Surplices, Tippets, Lawn-sleeves
or square Caps, or of keeping of Holy-days, or singing Psalms to Organs,
and to resolve the World in some plain points, as namely, Whether the
Soveraign Power may not lawfully enjoyn the observance of the external
Circumstances of Divine Worship, which every man doth in his own Family?
or Whether it be not as lawful for the Sovereign Power to enjoyn kneeling at
the Sacrament, as 'tis for private Persons to command their Flocks not to
kneel? and the resolving who doth most hurt by Christian Liberty either
the Magistrate, who, commanding me to kneel, tels me the thing is in its own
nature indifferent, and that he doth not and cannot change the nature of
things in themselves; or my private Pastor, who shall tell me That my not
kneeling is necessary to salvation? and the resolving the Question, Whether
I may lawfully oyn in a set form of Prayer with a Congregation, when 'tis
plain that another mans conceived, or extempore Prayer is as much a form to
me or to another as any printed Prayer can be? or the resolving what
Mr. Gataker in his Book of Lots, calls a frivolous Question as made by
some Separatists, viz. What Warrant have you to use this or that Form of
Prayer, or to pray upon a Book? (and to which he answers, That it is
Warrant sufficient that we are enjoyned to use Prayer, Confession of Sin, and
Supplication for Pardon, c. No set Form thereof determined, therefore
any fit Form warrantable: this Form that we use not unfit otherwise, this
Form thereof allowable. And let a man demand of one of them when he
prayeth, what Warrant he hath to use that Form that he then useth, he can
answer no otherwise. So for a Book, the means of help are not determined:
and this one among others: this therefore not unwarrantable. And if one
of them should be asked how he proves it warrantable to use a printed Book
to read on at Church: he shall not be able to make other answer than as be|fore)
and further hereupon the resolving of another Question, viz.
Whether one man eminent for Piety and Learning, or perhaps eminent for
neither, is able without premeditation to make as fit a Prayer for the People
to say Amen to, as a hundred Persons eminent for both are able to frame
with lng study? I say to make an Elias and much more the holy Iesus, to
come down from Heaven to solve such doubts as these, is an extravagance
Parallel with the Error of those old Poets, who would on all occasions
introduce Gods to end doubts that were never fit to be begun by men,
and wherein there was not dignus vindice nodus, and against which the
judicious Poet gave the known Caution of, Nec Deus interfit, c.
The holy Iesus by his Tacit Rejection of Questions as impertiment (that
the World thought of more moment than some such as are above named)
when he forbore to give his thoughts of Pythagoras his pre-existence of
Souls upon the Question put to him, viz. Who did sin this Man or his Parents
that he was born blind? shewed he thought it not for his honour to have
it supposed that it was part of his Errand from Heaven to set the World
rightin Speculations of Philosophy; and so he threw that famous Notion
off as a Titivilitium.
Chemnitius in his Harmony taking notice of our Saviour's reprehending
in the Pharisees their use of Oaths, and thereby invocating God as a
Witness in the Occurrences of their common talk and Conversation,
saith, In re levi ne magnum quidem virum in testem vocare auderemus:
as I find him cited by Mr. Gataker in his Book of Lots, and wherein he
doth so learnedly confute the superstitious conceit in some of the un|lawfulness
of the use of Cards and Dice in recreation, as likewise the other

of mens being obliged to count every thing unlawful that they have not
a Scriptural Warrant for.
Yet since his writing of those Books of Lots, thousands of such our su|perstitious
Protestants have not crupled to throw the Dye of War, and to
appeal to the Lord of Hosts by the Decision of Battel to signalize the
truth in some of those nugatory and others of those plain points before|mentioned:
and our Land groans under the guilt of the Blood of hun|dreds
of thousands of Subjects as well as of the Royal Blood, by Questions,
on which an ingenious man would scarce think a drop of Ink necessary
to be spent.
But I have in this Discourse express'd my belief, That the fierceness of
our Dissenters humour of quarrelling about such little Ceremonial matters
will be naturally reclaimed by the influence of the Civility appearing in
the many French Protestants here, into a Complaisance with our King's and
Church's enjoyned Ceremonies, that all the learned Books of our Divines
have not been able to work in them: the Civility of the French humour
making it natural to those Protestants (as I ave remarked) not only
to comply with Princes but even their Fellow Subjects in the use of
all Ceremonies they expect: and as I have in many places of this Dis|course,
and particularly in p. 239, expressed my thoughts that the sicari|ous
Principles of the Iesuites will naturally evaporate by fear and shame;
so I have in the following Page, that all Rebellious Principles of any No|minal
Protestants will by fear and shame in our populous English World be
abandoned: and do think, That to the shame of quarrelling about little
matters, the shame of doing it before Strangers, being super-added, will
prevent our future disquiet thereby.
Let them ask those Protestants who are fled hither from Persecution
(the Circumstances of which are with great Judgment stated by Dr.
Hicks in his Excellent printed Sermon on that Subject) if in case their
great Monarch had excused them from Conformity to the Gallican Church
in the points of Praying in an unknown Tongue, and the Worshipping
the Host, and the Forbidding the Cup to the Layety, and the other mo|mentous
Religionary points controverted between Papists and Protestants,
and had enjoyned them only such things as our Religion by Law Establish|ed
doth, whether they would have with the hazard of their lives made a
migration hither from the best Country in the World, their Native Soil,
or have made their Monarch and his Ministers at home uneasie by Com|plaints
of Persecution, and by raising of any dust about unnecessary Que|stions
as aforesaid.
Leo After tells us, that the Inhabitants of the Mountain Magnan on the
Frontiers of Fez, have not thought fit to be at the Charge of any settled
Judicature or Parade of the Law to support their Polity: but to the end
their Controversies emerging may be decided, and that impartially, they
stop some Travellers passing that way, to give Judgment in the same; and
that himself in his passage there was detained many days to perform the
Office of a Judge, and that his performance of the same was rewarded by
the Inhabitants, defraying the Charges of his Stay: and some of those
People were ashamed perhaps to trouble him, a Stranger with vilitiga|tion,
or querelles d' alleman.
And thus perhaps may those Protestant Strangers that Providence hath
sent hither prove to our Religionary branglers useful itinerant Judges, and
their patience in their Judicature will in my opinion deserve to be well re|warded,
and for the greatness of its burden from the minuteness of its

Controverted Causes, and whereby Strangers are imposed on by as need|less
trouble as Travellers would be if in the several Territories they passed
through, the Inhabitants should desire them to weigh their Air. But I
hope the Non-Conformists to the Gallican Church will find those to ours
ashamed to entertain them here with the Crambe of old Controversies of
Ceremonies and things Indifferent; and that those Strangers will not find
themselves invited hither by Nature as to a Theatre, where they shall
only see our digladiations with Air, or beating of the Air (as the Scrip|ture
Expression is) and much less where they shall see any Dissenters
implicitly swallowing the Doctrine of Resistance, and weighing nothing
but Air.
It was (I think) a little before the Migration of so many French Pro|testants
here, that some of the Faex of our Dissenters were so shameful
as to Nick-name our Clergy: But I do account that the inquisitive and
Philosophical Temper of the Age, shining with so much lustre in our Eng|lish
Clergy (and which temper is as naturally accompanied with the gen|tle
warmth of Charity for the Persons of different Opiners as light it self
can be with heat) is a sufficient Guarranty to all Protestant eusants of
their finding from our Church all the favour, I will not say that they have
deserved from it, but all that they will or can: and I believe the Charity of
our Church-men is so great for them as almost to tempt them to wish
That there were some dignus vindice nodus in the Religionary part of
Dissenters Principles, that might give our Cergy a signal occasion to
display the before mentioned Characteristical mark of Christianity in loving
the Persons of Men dissenting from them in any matters of mo|ment.
They have experimented this temper of our Divines in Dr. Stilling|fleet's
Book of the Vnreasonableness of the Separation after so many of their
Waspish Pamphlets had attacqued his Excellent Sermon of the mischief of
separation: and the soft insinuations of reason, in which having produ|ced
from them so much unmanly passion, may serve as an indication that
the present Dissenteship is languishing under its old Age, when the gent|lest
weight and even when the Grass-hopper is a burden to it.
They have seen this happy temper appearing in some of our most Cele|brated
Divines not being exasperated against the persons of one another, tho
owning Sentiments different from our Articles and Homilies. And indeed
'tis natural to any man of a great Genius (and of such illustrious Abilities
that all the several Religionary Parties thinks of, with the wish of Vtinam
noster esset) in some Notions peculiar to himself, to soar above the com|mon
light of the ordinary Observers of their Rules and Prescriptions, and
not to be fled out of the hearts of those of their Sect, when some times
he towres out of their, sight and above the reach of their understand|ings.
I have in the Learned Theological Writings of Mr. Baxter, con|cerning
Iustifications, contemplated his great parts and abilities: and have
likewise observed the great Learning of Doctor Tully appearing in his Iu|stificatio
Paulina, and where he saith, That in the point of Iustification the
Controversy is not de muris, sed de Palladio Christiano: and have more|over
read Dr. Tully's printed Letter to Mr. Baxter wherein he chargeth
him (whether justly or no I enquire not) for seeming to place most if
not all the differences that are in the point of Iustification between us
and the Church of Rome, among Logomachies, p 16th, and useth to him
these words in p. 17. But seeing you are so busie in turning our greatest Con|troversies

with the Papists into a Childish Contest of words, and in p. 21.
he desires him, That he would consider the great affinity his Tenet of Justi|fication
hath contracted with the Roman, and in the same Page desires
him to take his Balance and weigh more diligently, that he might see only
the very small odds between his justification and the Council of Trent's.
That great Adorner of the Church of England both with his Learning
and Piety, Dr. Hammond, thought it not so acceptable service to the World
to fill it with more Volumes against the Idolatry of the Church of Rome,
as to diminish it by distinction, and when in his Tract of Idolatry . 64. p.
41. he makes the worshipping of the Host to be only material Idolatry, tho
he knew as well as any the Articles of our Church, and that without the
formale peccati as well as the materiale, there can be no sin of Commission,
and that in all things forma dat esse.
Our Famous Dr. Ieremy Taylor likewise in his liberty of Prophesying,
p. 258, doth free the Papists from Formal Idolatry. Thus likewise tho
our Homilies and our Iewel, Raynold, Whitaker, Vsher, c. and the
Translators of our Bible into English in King Iames's time did place
the Name of Anti-Christ, and the Man of Sin on the Bishop of Rome,
yet Dr. Hammond as well as others of our Church have publickly avow|ed
their Sentiments of the Popes not being so.
I have not mentioned this as if I thought that any of our excellent
Divines of the Church of England, would ever occasion the least um|brage
of jealousie in any Future Conjuncture, about any design of uni|ting
our Church to Rome, or Rome's to ours: the common Rule in Poli|ticks
of minor pars unita majori censetur facta illius appendix (and which
is exemplified by the Church of Rome, not having been united to all the
Aiatick, African, Graecian, Russian and Protestant Churches, as containing
three times more Christian Souls than doth the Church of Rome with all
its Dependents and Adherents) and the ineffectual Project of some well
meaning Divines in a former Conjuncture here, will I believe effectually
avert all future jealousies of any thing of that Nature, or the danger of
any in the Vessel by trying to pull the Rock to it, bringing it super hanc Pe|tram.
From various grounds of natural reason, I may venture to predict
that the best Evangelical Church and the best Clergy the World can shew,
will direct their measures suitably to those Words of the great Evangelical
Prophet Isaiah, Their strength is to it still, and without any faith to remove
the seven Hills or Mountains of Rome hither, or on their sullen Contu|macy
resolving like Mahomet to go to the Mountains.
Among the various Considerations urged in this Discourse to fortifie
the minds of the Loyal timid against their unaccountable fears of Hete|rodoxy
in any Prince as to the Religion by Law Established, rendring
him a meer natural Agent, or one without freedom of will as to the point
of freedom of their Consciences, and depriving him of the Brains as well
as Bowels of a Man, and against impressions of trouble from what so ma|ny
Writers have insinuated, namely, that a Roman Catholick Prince
must by virtue of the Authority of the Lateran Council exterminate
his Heretical Subjects, I have in p. 283 mentioned that the Munster Peace
hath in Germany, cured the timid Lutheran and Calvinist Subjects of any
fears and jealousies as of their Religion and Property upon any Prince by
the Lineal Course of Descent coming to be their Ruler, who may profess
any Religionary Sentiments different from theirs.
And because the factum of that Peace hath not by any Writers since our
late fermentation (that I know of) been insisted on for the illumination

of Peoples understandings in the firm Provision made there for mens be|ing
secure in their Religion by Law Established, whatever the Religion
of their lawful Princes may be, I shall here give some Cursory Account
of the great Fact of that Peace (and wherein some Popish Princes made
so great a Figure, and who sufficiently understood how far the Later an
Council obliged them) that may not only shew it a kind of Pedantry to
imagine that Roman Catholick Princes are still by their Religion bound,
after all the Revolutions of time and its incursions made on their former
measures as to Heterodox Religion and Religionaries, to use the same
Methods as formerly, and to move in the same Line as heretofore, (just as
some Crabs on the Land are observed in the West-Indies to be so sullen in
their way, that rather than they will move in the least on any side, they
will go over a House or a Tree) but may likewise serve as a Praemunimen|tum
to secure men in all future times against the fear of any danger to their
Religion by the Heterodoxy of their Princes, a thing that may be expected
often to happen, since People can no more promise themselves that their
Princes will successively resemble one another in their understanding
faculties than in their bodily shapes.
Thus then sufficiently for the purpose above mentioned the Reader
may take the Scheme of that matter.
It may be observed that in Sueden and Dnmark and in all the Territo|ries
of the lower and upper Saxony where ever Protestants have the sole
power, no Papists are permitted to have any publick exercise of their Re|ligion:
and that in Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, and all the Hereditary
Lands of the House of Austria, Bavaria and the upper Palatinate, where
the Papists have the sole Power, no Protestants are suffered to have the
publick Exercise of their Religion. And these whole Territories above
mentioned being entire bodies within themselves, under one head either
of the one or the other Religion, without the intermixture of different
Dominions, are uniform in the exercise of their Religion respectively
different.
But the intermediate parts of the German Empire are interwoven un|der
several Princes of different Religions, and therefore are of mixt Re|ligionary
professions: that is to say, those professions are exercised some
here, some there in different places: and because the Inhabitants of the
intermediate Territories being mixed and pretending to have each of them
a right to the same places of Worship, various Quarrels did arise among
them: therefore when they deprived one another of the freedom to ex|ercise
their Religion, the Treaty of Peace at Munster and Osnabrug in
the year 1648. did appoint the restitution of places for the publick exer|cise
of Religion on both sides, and ordered that all matters of this kind
should be thence forward settled as they were in use heretofore in the
Year 1624: which Order occasioned a Deputation from all the States of
the Empire at Francford in the Year 1656, and 1657 and following, to
see that Decree and other matters put in Execution.
Those intermediate Territories are the Circles of Westphalia, of the
Rhine, of the Welterans, of Franconia, and of Suaben containing many
Principalities and great Cities, depending immediately upon the Empire,
which being of different Religions and mixed one with another, in re|spect
of their Territories and Jurisdictions, none that in the time of War
was prevalent, did suffer a different Religion to be exercised: but
since the Instrument of the Peace made at Munster and Osnabrug was
published, the liberty of Religion is to be regulated universally by the 7th

Article and some other Articles determining matters between Protestants
and Papists: and according to this Constitution altho some Territories,
which formerly were under Protestant Divines, are now under a Popish
power, and vice vers, yet the liberty of Religion is to be left to each Party
as it was used in the year 1624.
Thus the Duke of Newburg and one of the Landgraves of Hessen, and
a Prince of Nassaw are obliged to leave to the Protestants within their
Dominions, the free exercise of their Religion. And so in some of the
Imperial Cities, as in Francford, Ausburg and others, the Papists have
the free exercise of their Religion restored to them among the Prote|stants.
At Ausburg the Magistracy is half of the one and half of the other Reli|gion:
but in all the other Imperial Cities the Magistrates (I think)
were wholly Protestants, except at Collen and Heilbron where they are
wholly Papists.
If any one considering the sharper Animosities between Lutherans and
Calvinists, then those between either of them and the Papists (accord|ingly
as we are told by Tacitus, that Odia proximorum sunt acerrima)
shall tell me, That if the Treaty of Munster and Osnabrug did plant Civi|lity
among Lutherans and Calvinists as to the Persons and Religions of
each other, it did wonders, I shall therein accord with him, and that it
was somewhat like that of the pulling down the Partition-wall between
Iew and Gentile; and that tho Luther a more Cholerick yet (I think)
a better natured man than Calvin, did sufficiently in his Writings inveigh
against the asperity of Magistrates in punishing Heterodoxy (and parti|cularly
in his Tract, De magistratu saeculari: parte secund, where he tells
Chief Magistrates so doing, viz. Per Deum sancte juro, si id verum, tantil|las
vires in vos acceperit vestra negligentia, nulli estis, etiamsi siguli non es|setis
inferiores Turca ipso, potenti: neque vestra crudelitas  rabies vobis
quicquam commodabunt: yet many of Luthers followers did not imbibe
that his opinion, and as appeared long ago by a dreadful instance of this
in Queen Mary's time, when Iohn a Lasco Uncle to the King of Poland,
and many Families of Strangers who had been here received by Edward
the 6th, were banished by Queen Mary, and went for Asylum to the King
of Denmark, but (as I have read it in the History of that Migration of
theirs writ in Elegant Latin by Iohn a Lasco) he renders their usage in
Denmark by the Clergy and Populace to have been very severe, and
makes the first Course in their Entertainment to be an Invitation to Church
some days after their landing, on pretence of being instructed, and the
hearing there Cal and themselves publickly lampon'd or railed at: and
because that pleased not their palates, their next was, an Edict to be
gone from the Metropolis in a peremptory short time, when the Season of
the Frost in that Country was so extremely afflictive, and without per|mission
for their Sick or Infants or Women with Child to stay for the
Clemency of better weather; and whereby many of them there died
with the extremity of the cold in their Journeys. And it had been in a
manner as eligible for them to have stayed and perished in England by the
Fires of Queen Mary: And Alsted in his Chronology speaking of what
happened in Queen Mary's Reign, saith to this purpose, Multi ob Religio|nem
mutatam, Angli relict prim in Daniam, deiude in Germaniam veni|unt:
nam in Dania non poterant habere locum, per theologorum rabiem: inter
exules fuit Johannes Lascus Polonus.

But I can by the Munster Peace, direct the Reader to see that old Lu|theran
bigotry and hatred of the Persons and Religion of Calvinists ex|terminated
out of Germany, whereby it is determined as by a Statue
Law, that the Calvinists shall have the same right for the free exercise of
their Religion which the Lutherans and Papists have, and that to the end
that any might be ashamed of pretending to be afraid of any detriment
that might accrue to their Persons or Religion, under a Lutheran or
Calvinian or Popish Successor, and that all might be really afraid of dis|honouring
God and wounding their Consciences, by prejudicing the In|heritable
Rights of those Princes Successions, it is thus further determin|ed
by the 7th Article of the Instrumentum pacis Caesareo suecicum, . 1.
viz. Vnanimi quoque Caesareae majestatis omniumque ordinum consensu, c.
'Tis likewise thought fit by the unanimous Consent of the Emperor and all the
States of the Empire, that whatever right or benefit both all the other Con|stitutions
of the Empire, and the Peace of Religion, and this publick agree|ment,
and the decision of all Grievances therein do allow to all Catholick
States and Subjects, and to those addicted to the Augustan Confession, the
same shall likewise be allowed to those that are called the Reformed, (i. e.
Calvinists) with a Salvo to the States called Protestants (i. e. Lutherans)
as to all things Covenanted and agreed between themselves with their own Sub|jects,
and as to all Privileges and other dispositions whereby Provision was
made for Religion and its exercise and the things thereon depending, by the
States and Subjects of each place, and with a Salvo to each for the freedom of
their Consciences. Now because the Controversies of Religion which are in
Agitation at this time among the forenamed Protestants have not been hither|to
reconciled, but have been referred to a further endeavour of agreement,
so that they still make two Parties: therefore concerning the right of reform|ing
it is thus agreed between them: that if any Prince or other Lord of the
Territory or Patron of any Church shall hereafter change his Religion, or
obtain or recover a Principality or Dominion either by the right of Suc|cession
or by virtue of this present Treaty, or by any other Title whatsover;
where the publick exercise of the Religion of the other Party is at present in
use, it shall be free to him to have his Court-Chaplains of his own Religion a|bout
him in the place of his Residence, without any burthen or prejudice to his
Subjects: but it shall not be lawful for him to change the publick Exercise of
Religion or the Laws, or Ecclesiastical Constitutions which have been there
hitherto in use, or take from those their Churches whose they formerly were,
or their Schools or Hospitals, or the Revenues, Pensions and Stipends belong|ing
thereunto, or apply them to the men of their own Religion, or obtrude on
their Subjects men of another Religion, under the pretence of a Territorial
Episcopal or Patronal Right, or under any pretence whatsoever, or bring
about any other hinderance directly or indirectly to the Religion of the other
Party, c.
In fine, here hath been a great Pacification, and the same agreed on
to be a perpetual Law, and pragmatick Sanction, and as strongly binding
as any Fundamental Law or Constitution thereof, comprhending in be|half
of the Emperor, all his Confederates and Adherents, first the Catho|lick
King and House of Austria the Electors and Princes of the Empire,
the Hanse Towns, the King of England, the King of Denmark and Nor|way,
and all the Princes and Republicks of Italy, and the States of Hol|land
and others, and in the behalf of the Queen of Sweden all her Con|federates,
the most Christian King, the Hanse Towns, the King of Eng|land,
the King of Denmark and the Dutch States, c.

Well: but yet it may be by our timid Protestants objected; that all
these Roman Catholick Princes thus projecting the Peace of Germany and
that of Christendom, did in this great Instrumentum pacis and the pacta Con|venta
referred to, but reckon without their Host, I mean the Bishop of
Rome, and that one Bull against it from Rome would thunder it to no|thing,
and render it voidable or void, and that all the Concessions to
Heresie and Hereticks, and hindring their Extermination were nugatory,
and that such a written Treaty carried in it, its own deletion and that of He|reticks,
and that the Bulla Caenae every Maundy Thursday Excommunicates
and Cures all Lutherans, Calvinists, Hugonots, and their Receivers, Fautors,
and Defenders, and that the many immunities granted to Hereticks by
this Peace as likewise Lands and Territories, and the Erecting of Bishop|ricks
into Secular Principalities, and settling them on Heretical Princes
and their Heirs forever, whereby so much prejudice accrued to the Roman
Catholick Religion and the Apostolick Sea, would probably engage the
Pope some time or other to quash it as null, and to damn both the Peace
and all that made it.
I answer, that within two days after the signing that Peace, the Popes
Nuntio at Munster protested against it: declaring that he made that Pro|testation
by the Pope's express Commands: and on the 26th of November
1648, Pope Innocent the 10th issued out his Bull against it from Rome
called, Sanctissimi Domini nostri Inncentii divina providentia Papae. X. De|claratio
nullitatis articulorum nuperae Pacis Germanicae, Religioni Catholicae,
sedi Apostolicae, Ecclesiis aliisque locis piis ac persons  juribus Ecclesiasti|cis
quomodolibet praejudicialium, ad aeternam Rei memoriam. And he
therein blames the Emperor and his Confederates and the most Christian
King, on the account of the perpetual abdication of some Ecclesiastical
Goods and Rights possessed by Hereticks, and for their permitting to He|reticks
the free exercise of their Religion by that Peace, and their being
further Authorized by it to bear Offices and enjoy not only Church Li|vings
but Bishopricks, and Arch-Bishopricks: and in fine, that Pope ha|ving
made it null and void, further declares, That if any have sworn to
observe the Articles of that Peace, such Oath shall not bind them.
But what did this Declaration from his Holyness signify in that Case?
No more than one from Prester Iohn would have done. The Emperor
and Princes of Germay did gloriously stand to their Pacta conventa, and
took care to see the same solemnly ratified and executed notwithstanding
the Papal Declaration of their Nullity. They knew the Pope's Nuntio
would soon protest, and the Pope himself declare against the Peace:
and had therefore in Terms therein agreed, That no Canons or special De|crees
of Councils or Concordats with Popes or Protestations, or Edicts, Re|scripts,
Mandates or Absolutions whatsoever should in any Future time be al|lowed
against any Article of it. And they likewise knew that the Pope's
Declaration of the Nullity of that Treaty would contain no Threatnings
of Excommunication or Damnation against their Persons, but only Quelques
choses or things of Course, or to speak more properly Nullities of Course:
and that while all Christendom was embarqued in that Treaty and going
with full Sail, and favoured with a strong Gale of Nature into its Haven
of Rest, and being to pass by the Popes Fort, and had resolved against
lowering their Flag to it, the Pope would of Course fire some Bulls of
Nullity at them Charged with no significant Shot, and as it is usual for
the Forts of Princes to do to Ships that pass by them without paying the
expected Civility, and the Shot from which is not valued by Capital

Ships that pass by them with a strong Gale of Wind: and which perhaps
think it not tanti to fire again upon the Fort; nor doth that perhaps
throw away more shot on them.
And thus stood this Munster Peace, wrought (as it were) by the con|sent
of the Crowned Heads and States of Christendom, and thus it stands;
and any who will look into the Empire will find those Pacta con|venta
as to the part of the Emperor and Princes of the Empire outbra|ving
the chances of time to this year (how much soever the Emperor
may be supposed to have been steer'd by Iesuites Councils) and likely
still so to do, whereby the various Rights and Religions of Princes and
their Subjects have been secured, and whereby we may see how unstudied
those men are in the great Book of the World, who think that Popish
Princes will not go on in the Course of their Politicks, tho the Pope
should seem in earnest or in jest to stop them, and that they cannot tacitly
reject the Papal Declarations of Nullity, and yet continue Civil to the
Pope and his Church.
The firm continuance of the Munster Peace to the year 1680, is men|tioned
by the Author of an ingenious Book called, The Interest of Princes
and States that year published, and which goeth under the name of Mr.
Bethel, and where 'tis moreover observed in p. 155. That among the Luthe|ran
Princes the Prince of Hannover was lately turned Papist, and likewise one
of the House of the Landgrave of Hessen, Darmestat and another of Meck|lenburg
lately turned Papist, but their Countries do all continue Lutherans,
and among the Calvinist Princes he mentions the Elector of Brandenburg,
but saith, his Dominions are most Lutherans, and where in p. 156. 'tis his
Observation that of four Popish Princes of the Empire, all their Countries
are Lutherans, and saith, the Princes in this Country (meaning Germany)
have no great influence on their Subjects in point of Religion: and saith,
That in several Countries belonging to Popish Bishops and Abbots, many Lu|therans
and some Calvinists have not only a Right, but do also actually enjoy
the publick exercise of their several Religions without disturbance, and much
more without Persecution: and further instanceth in other places in Germa|ny
where the Proprietors are mixt of several Princes, Earls, Free Cities,
and Romish Ecclesiasticks which causeth in each of them the like Variety in
Religion, and some there being Lutherans and Papists and others being Cal|vinists,
Lutherans and Papists.
And thus we see instead of the Popes having nulled the Munster Peace
cum effectu, the Nulla fides servanda cum haereticis, hath been nulled in
Germany by Popish Princes, and which if they had not done, Luthers
aforesaid nulli estis had been their doom: and the Empire it self had scarce
been more than a substantial Nullity, as I may say alluding to what Van|tius
in his Book, De Nullitatibus makes such. In plain terms the Ger|mans
had not else been now a Nation, nor would the Emperor again have
been saluted by the Grand Signior, as I have in some of the Comminato|ry
Letters from the Port observed him called, viz. Lord of few Regions:
and this any one (I think) will grant who shall consider that all the re|laxation
he hath had either of intestine troubles or Foreign between the
years 1648 and 1680, hath made his Circumstances as to Power and
Riches appear but just proportionable for holding his own (with the help
of his Neighbours) against the Turk.
I have observed great right done to the Emperors Politicks in that
Peace, by a printed Panegyrical Oration made by Henricus Schmid, a Fa|mous
Professor of Divinity in Tubing, for the Celebration of the Munster

Peace, and wherein he saith, That the Emperor preserved thereby at least
the lives of eleven times a hundred and ninety two thousand Myriades of
men (that is of 21 thousand, 1 hundred and 20 millions of men) and
whereupon the Panegyrist pronounceth, That the World was blest by a
new AEra from that Peace: and some of the Expressions in that Oration
for that purpose being very memorable, I shall here set down, viz. Ferdi|nande
Caesar Auguste, pie faelix triumphator, salve, Faelicior Iulio Casare
qui gloriabundus fatebatur, undecies centena  nonaginta duo millia homi|num
praeliis  se occisa; atque ita ut non veniat in hanc rationem stragem
Civilium bellorum, Tua, Imperator, qu major esse non potest, gloria  clari|tudo
erit, totidem Myriadas aut plures non mactasse sed servasse. Macte
animo isto tuo, imperator, c. Tuis auspiciis novum Calendarium Iuliano
longe melius ac emendatius orbi Christiano exhibetur, quod pacis aera insigni|tur,
c.
The Panegyrical Orator did in his Calculation of the Lives saved by
the Emperor, use more than Poetical Licence, as any one will probably
think who shall read what Sir W. P. in a printed Discourse hath mention'd
of Critical Persons having judged that there are but 320 Millions of
Souls now in the World: and according to some ingenious mens Calcu|lations
I have seen in print concerning how much at a Medium each head
may be supposed to add to the Riches of a State per year, and thence
making each to be therefore valuable at 80 l. Sterling, the Panegyrick
may be said to have made the Emperor preserve for the World by that
Peace 1 Hundred 68 Thousand 9 Hundred and 60 Millions of Pounds Ster|ling.
But leaving so exorbitant a Sum for the disposition and Assets of De|go's
Will, and (raillery apart) accounting the lives of the hundreds of
thousands slain in Germany on the Score of the Excommunication of Princes
and Emperors, (as I have in p. 68 mentioned out of Erastus and suitably
enough to Historical truth) to have been valuable to the Empire at but
half of 80 l. each, it may well be supposed that it was a very vast Treasure
that Germany hath lost by its Wars and preserved by its said Peace.
Yet is there one way assignable from which it may be deduced that
the value of what the Emperor preserved was as much really too short,
as from the Panegyrists account it appeared extravagant; and that is this,
viz. The Emperor by that Peace having kept so many from afterward
destroying their own Souls by destroying others Bodies, may be truly said
to have preserved what was invaluable, we know who having judged it
that there is no proportion between the wealth of the whole World and
one Soul.
And now having by the deduction of the great Fact proved the Practi|cableness
of the happy continuance of the luscious blessings of Peace and
Unity of affections among Princes and their Subjects of different Religi|ons,
I shall here in the Close of the Consideration of the same, entertain
the Reader with this last pleasant agreeable Scene of it, which Scene will
represent to him the fair Church built at Fredericsburg by the present
Prince Elector, one of the fairest Churches in Germany: and which was
by him in our great year of fears and jealouies and fatal discords, name|ly
1680, finished and dedicated to Holy Concord and Vnion perhaps in
Contra-distinction to the Term of Holy Church: and its Dedication and
Consecration was with great Devotion solemnized, and not without the
choicest Vocal and Instrumental Musick that could be thought proper to
be used then, and with which the Offices of the Ceremony began: and

the Musick being over, there was an inaugural Oration there made in the
honour of Holy Concord, and of the Dedication of the Church to it.
And after that, the Prince Elector (who is a Calvinist) engaged Doctor
Fabritius Principal Divine to his Electoral Highness, to preach there;
and in the Afternoon of that day another Sermon was there Preach'd by a Lu|tran
Divine, and in the Evening, another Sermon was there made by a
Roman-Catholick Divine: and they all made pious and learned Sermons in
order to the propagating of Holy Concord, applauding therein the Ele|ctors
design, and with a most devout attention all those three Divines
were present at each others Sermons.
Nor was any of his Popish Subjects then afraid that he would infringe
the rights of the exercise of their Religion, because the Papal Interest had
been so active in bereaving his Family of the Bohemian Crown as well as of
its ancient Rights, many of which are forever abdicated from it by the
Munster Peace.
Thus on this Rock of the Munster Peace was the Holy Concord of holy
Church-men discordant in opinions founded abroad by a Prince allied to
the Crown of England, and whereby the opposite Religionary Opinors
quitted their Antipathys against each other, and the Lion made under
his Government to lie down with the Lamb, at the same time that we
groaned under a judgment more opprobrious than that threatned to the
Iews in Leviticus, namely, The sending of wild Beasts among them, I mean
that of our Populace being frightened and worried with Chymaeras and with
Chymeric Ideas of all Popish Princes being bound to have the Council of
Lateran by heart, and to observe it semper  ad semper, and without the
Latitude of Prudence which the very Definition of Moral Verue makes
Essential to it (as I may say with allusion to Aristotle's sicut vir prudens
eam definiret) and to lose themselves in catching of Tartars, and to have
forgot the Saying of Solomon, That in the multitude of the People is
the King's honour, and the want of people is the destruction of the Prince,
and with the Idea of a Heterodox Prince swearing to maintain the Laws
and yet breaking them, and with another Idea as horrid and monstrous,
namely, that men might observe their Oaths acknowledging Allegiance
to Kings and their Heirs and Successors, and yet exclude their Heirs and
Successors from the Throne by a Law.
It was an Observation worthy of the Doctor of the Gentiles, and which
he inculcated to the Corinthians, namely, that  the fa|shion
of this World passeth away.
I have in this Discourse mentioned that in the year 1212, the Lateran
Council brought in Transubstantiation as an Article of Faith, and de|creed
Princes were to be compelled to exterminate Hereticks: but the
World hath been often Transubstantiated since that time, and its substance
that the Apostle calls its fashion hath been ever in transitu: and the fashion
of that Lateran Council is so far passed away that Protestant Writers are
somewhat put to it to prove it to have been a General one.
There was a scurvy fashion long since in the World abroad, and that
was the fashion of mens sowing a piece of red Cloth on their Garments,
when the Monks had Preached them into Crusados, for the Exterminium
haereticorum, and by Virtue of one of which Crusado's Bellarmine boasts
that 100,000 of the Albingenses were slain; but that fashion hath been
long left off in the World, and the World been since no more outraged
by it than by the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross, nor so much as our English
World hath been by some who have troubled it about the sign of the Cross.

It was a saying of the old Greek Philosophers, 
and the Papal World is as to many of its Politicks quite another thing
from what it was. Azorius in his Instit. Moral. observed in his time, That
it falls out often that that which was not the common opinion a few years ago,
now is.
Some of our timid Protestants who do not know the Papal, Luthe|ran
and Calvinian World, because they see it not in the Antique fashion
they heard it was dressed in 30 or 40 or 50 years ago, seem to have been
asleep since the Munster Treaty, and to have dreamed that such fashion
would never alter, and are like Epeminides that the old Fables mention to
have fetched a sleep of fifty years, and who found himself lost in the
World at his wakening, wanting the sight of the old fashion to shew him
where he was.
I have therefore a great Compassion for those Protestants who take
the measures of their Religion and Politicks in a manner only out of the
Revelation, and who think that almost all the Predictions of that Book
were made only for England, and that England was made to be governed
only by their fancies, and their fancies to be given up only to fears of all
ill fashions of things and principles in the World being unalterable, tho
there be scarce a Chapter in that Sacred Book but what refers to Changes
and Revolutions, and to moving the unwieldy bulk of Empires by unex|pected
and irresistable Turns of Fate.
The old Fashion of the Popish Writers asserting the Right of the Bishop
of Rome to take away Hereticks lives by virtue of that Branch of the
Iudicial Law of the Iews, Deuteronomy 17th, hath been long extermi|nated
by them. The words of the Text are thus agreeable to the old
Latin Translation, And he that out of Pride shall refuse to obey the Com|mandment
of that Priest which shall at that time Minister before the Lord
thy God, that man shall by the Sentence of the Iudge be put to death: and
the Calvinistick Fashion of founding the practice of Hereticidium on the
Authority of the Iudicial Law is passed away. I have in this Discourse
represented the Tenet of firing Heretical Cities, that is in the Canon Law
founded on Deuteronomy the 13th, to be chargeable on our late Presby|terians,
and that justly on the account of their having declared the Iudi|cial
Law obligatory to us: and have shewed what Calvin's Principle and
Practice was pursuant to that Law.
The Learned Klockius a Lutheran Lawyer in his large Volume de Aera|rio
l. 2. c. 86. n. 10. endeavours to acquit the Divines of his Religionary
perswasion from the Tenet of Hereticide, and saith. Nostri vero Theologi
ut capitali paen haereticos (contr quam plerique Calvinianorum cum Pon|tificiis
censent) affici nolunt, ita nec bonorum confiscationem, meo judicio,
concederent: and Pellerus in his Notes on Klockius refers to Thuanus about
Servetus his Case, and saith of him, Igitur comprehensus, cum sententiam
mutare nollet, re prius ex Iohannis Calvini consilio cum Bernatibus. Tigu|rinis,
Basileensibus  Schafusianis Ministris communicat, tandem ad
mortem damnatus est. Ejus doctrinam poste Calvinus (qud ei ex illius
invidia conflaretur) proposuit  publicato libro confutavit, quo in haereti|cos
etiam gladio  magistratu animadvertendum esse contendit. But Beza
who was a Calvinist, and in the first Tome of his Works, p. 85. asserts the
lawfulness of punishing Hereticks with death, cites not only Bullinger, who
was a Calvinist, but Melanchton, who was a Lutheran, for the same opinion:
and Zanchius Operum Tome 4. Lib. 1. in tertium praeceptum expresly owns
that opinion.

The fashion of the Iudicial Law of the Iews in that point was cer|tainly
most proper for the Body of their Polity, as being thereunto adap|ted
by the great Legislator: but to say that all States and Polities are
bound to observe it, because God prescribed it to the Iews, is as sense|less,
as to say that all men are bound to go cloathed in Beasts Skins, be|cause
God did Apparel Adam and Eve in that fashion.
I have in this Discourse thought it of some use to the publick to have
mens understandings disabused, as to the obligatory power of the Iudi|cial
Law, because mens erring therein hath very much encreased the fer|mentations
in his Majesties Realms in several Conjunctures.
It is not unknown that Deuteronomy the 13th, and the 6th was urged to
Queen Elizabeth, as an Argument for putting the Queen of Scots to
death.
Our Kingdom hath likewise found by experience, That the Fifth Monar|chy
men, have not fired more Guns against us out of the Revelation, than
the Scotch Presbyterians have out of the Iudicial Law.
An Excellent Discourse called Fair warning to take heed of the Scotish
Discipline, printed in the year 1649, and writ (I think) by Arch-Bi|shop
Bramhall, asserts in Chap. 6. That it robs the Magistrate of his dis|pensative
Power: and saith there, Our Disciplinarians have restrained it in
all such Crimes as are made Capital by the Iudicial Law, as in the Case of
Blood, Adultery, Blasphemy, in which Cases they say the Offender ought to
suffer death as God hath commanded. And if the life be spared as it ought
not to be to the Offenders, c. And the Magistrate ought to prefer Gods
strict Commandment before his own corrupt Iudgment, especially in punishing
these Crimes which he commandeth to be punished with death. The Books
of the Scotch Discipline are there particularly cited by the Author.
I have been expressly cautious in the following Discourse to exempt the
Reformed Churches abroad, from the Odium of those Principles of the
former Scotch and English Presbyterians that I have impugned as Disloyal
and Seditious; and was a Concurrer with many loyal Persons after part
of it was written in thinking that time had untaught those Principles to
most of our present Non-Conformists: and notwithstanding the many
Seditious and Libellous Pamphlets published by some of them against the
Government both of Church and State, yet such was the continuance of
the Candor of the Kings Ministers to them, as that some at the Tryal of a
poor seditious Nominal Protestant at Oxford occasionally declared before
that wretch, We know of no Presbyterian Plot.
But as a Popish Ambassador sent to Queen Elizabeth began his Audi|ence
Speech wherein he was to complain of the Turks having unprovo|ked
broke their League with his Master, Erupit tandem Ottomannorum
Virus, it happened that about the time of the finishing of this Discourse,
the poyson of some pretended Protestants former Seditious Principles broke
out again in a horrid Conspiracy before mentioned, and which was con|fessed
by several of the Conspirators at their Executions, and another of
whom owned the Doctrine of Resistance.
Our blessed Saviour cautioning the Christian World in the words of,
Beware of false Prophets, saith, You shall know them by their Fruits.
And our famous Whitaker hath in his Controversies well resolved us
that these Fruits whereby false Prophets are to be distinguished from true,
are rather their Principles, Interpretations and Doctrines, than their Lives,
it being generally observed that the Founders of Sects are exemplary for
the austerity of their lives, and for coming in Sheeps clothing, as our Sa|viours
words are.

What the Principles of the Non-Conformists in King Iames his Reign
were, I have shewn in this Discourse, with a Remark on the Political Con|sideration,
that after the aera of the Gun-powder Treason induced them
to give a Scheme thereof voluntarily to the Government, and namely,
that they might thereby avoid the receiving a Test from it: and no doubt
it was obvious to them that while their Principles were hid and conceal|ed
from the State, the warding off of Faux his Dark Lanthorn would not
have left the Government secure, till it had likewise got the Non-Confor|mist
dark Lanthorn from them, I mean by the publication of their Te|nets.
Of their Principles shortly after 41, the Scotch Covenant was a sufficient
Scheme. And tho the Tenets of Presbyterians and Independents
relating to their Forms of Church Government are enought known as is
likewise the degree of their Complicating Principles of Sedition with
the same, between the years 1641 and 1660: yet from that last year to
this present one, they have not by the publication of any Confession of
Faith or Scheme of their Tenets; satisfied the Government that all their
Principles are consistent with the Civil Polity thereof, and that they
have renounced those former Tenets of theirs that once destroyed it, and
particularly that intolerably seditious one, viz. That if the Magistrate will
not reform the World, they may.
But because several of their Ecclesiasticks have not renounced the Irre|ligionary
part of their former Principles (and which were so destructive
to the Sacred Persons of Princes and their State and Government, and of
all Humane Society) the Vniversity of Oxford in their Convocation Iuly
21st, Anno 1683. did to their great honour pass their Iudgment and De|cree
against certain particular Books of Non-Conformists, and Iesuites and
others, wherein those Tenets and Principles were owned: and the very
shewing of those Tenets to the World by such learned and loyal hands,
hath been (I believe) useful in making many of the Loyal Lay Non-Conformists
withdraw from others of them they thought therewith infected;
a thing that might well be supposed naturally to happen when those of
them to whom the term of Sober Party was most due, observed that the
publication of the Dissenters Sayings and of the Censure of their Tenets, had
not occasioned their Leaders to publish other Dissenters Sayings, or Te|nets
that impugned Disloyalty and Sedition, and promoted obedience to
Government, and what several Writers of the Church of Rome have been
formerly observed to do upon the Worlds minding how much the Princi|ples
of the Iesuites had shook the Thrones of Kings, and as particularly
Father Caron in his Remonstrantia Hybernorum hath done, and there
citing 250 Popish Authors who deny the Pope's Power to depose
Kings.
And no doubt but Dissenters late Omissions in this kind, and Commissions
in another, will awaken the Magistracy to require from all Protestant Re|cusants
such an exact Inventory of their Tenets as hath not yet been given
it: and the rather for that it is not by any Dissenters denied that the So|vereign
is so far Custos utriusque tabulae, as to be allowed to require all
Religionary Parties to give him an account of their Principles, and to live
according to the Rule of them.
Thus in the Dutch States the Magistrates of every place where any
Sect of the Heterodox is tolerated, are religiously careful, first to inform
themselves exactly of all their Tenets and Principles, and to see that they
hold no opinion prejudicial to the Constitutions of their Government:

and none doubts but that the entire Body of the Tenets or Principles of
the Dissenters to the Gallican Church, is as conspicuous to that Church
and State, and indeed to the World as can be desired, the present agree|ment
of which with the Measures of Loyalty I have shewn in this Dis|course.
Who hath there read the Hugonots Sayings published with any stain to
their Loyalty, or hath seen any of their Tenets branded for Sedition by an
Vniversity or College in France? But our Protestant Recusants having had
here the liberty by Act of Parliament to enjoy their peculiar ways of Re|ligious
Worship in their own Families, with the toleration of four others
of the same perswasion to be present, before all their Principles and Te|nets
have been notified to the Government, is an instance of greater Indul|gence
shewn by the Government here to such Heterodox, than (I believe)
can be parallel'd in any Country whatsoever.
All dangers are naturally multiplied in the dark: and it is a diminution
of our dread of the very Iesuites Principles, that they are generally
known: but if the Body of their Principles were as much unknown,
as are those of Protestant Recusants, yet would the publick be more
immediately concerned in having first an accurate account of those of the
latter, as being more numerous.
It may be well thought a Bankrupt Church whose Principles are lati|tant:
and any mens begging from the Magistrate Indulgence to a Princi|ple
of Sedition, would be as shameful as the Insolence of a Beggar not only
begging twenty Pound (as our Comaedian said) but begging a Leg or an Arm:
and not like a mans asking me who stands in my way as I am travelling
on the Road that I would not ride over him, but that he may mount into
the Saddle whose Principles direct him to ride over me.
It was well observed by Lipsius in his Notes in Seneca, That Naturae
quodam Instinctu ea maleficia coercent homines  puniunt quae societatem con|vellunt.
But as to any Out-rages from any Religionaries which are either pre|judicial
to the Bodies of particular Persons, or even Convulsive of the Bo|dies
of States and Kingdoms (and to which the Actors might be incli|ned
by their particular heats, and not the general light of their avowed
Principles) I account that Complaints against such will soon evaporate
into Air or be buried in Earth, and with some allusion to the words of,
Let the dead bury the dead, I may say, let Plots bury Plots, and Shams
Shams, and let any Seditious Protestants and Seditious Papists on the
Compensation of their Crimes forbear troubling others by calling one ano|ther
Criminals; and the Figure of the Body of their Parties can no more
be altered by the unevenness and exorbitance of the actings of particular
Persons, than is the rotundity of the Earth by the ruggedness of Rocks
or protuberance of Mountains.
And that where one Papist goeth out of the World at the back door of
Justice, for the Treason of Clipping and Coyning, twenty of the more
numerous body of the Protestants do so, is not to be wondered at: but
the id ipsum to be regarded in any reflections made on a Religion by occa|sion
of its Criminals, is its Principles: and if it could be proved that any
Caetus of men were allowed by the Church of England to assert the lawful|ness
of that Treason, (as both Papists and Presbyterians have the lawful|ness
of the Doctrine of Resistance) that indeed would have the weight of
a just Reflection on our CHVRCH.

Tho several dissolute and nominal Protestants may possibly have in|vented
and forged as many Shams and Calumnious Accusations against
other Protestants and Papists, as if they had believed the Practice of
Calumny to be lawful, yet hath any of them published in Print the Te|net
of the lawfulness of it; or its being a poor Peccadillo? Who know|eth
not that some particular Divines of the Church of England by the
turbulence of their several dispositions, have enflamed differences and di|visions
in our Church and State? But who can charge them from doing
this by Communication of Councils with their Superiors, and by instru|ction
from them? Were any of them charged by Proclamations for do|ing
any thing of that nature, as some Popish Recusants were by his
Majesty's of Ian. 16. 1673. for chiefly occasioning the intestine divisions
among us, and by his Majesty's Proclamation of December 2d, 1680.
for fomenting of differences among his Loyal Protestant Subjects?
But yet this Fact tho thus by the Government charged on some ill
men of that Religionary perswasion would not have moved me to re|flect
with the leat heat on the Order of Iesuites in this Discourse (by
whom so many of our Roman Catholicks are conducted) but for their
own Proclamations of their Principles in their Books, and particularly as
to the point of Calumny, the only Engine by which Divisions could be
wrought among Protestants; and but for their setting up that Doctrine
heretofore, without leave from the Pope's Canon Law, and backing it
with another to fright any Fools or Knaves from disparaging or even ca|lumniating
them, and for their making use and application of these Do|ctrines
since the Pope had damned them by a Proclamation, I mean his
Edict of March 79: and but for Father Parsons having so scandalously
exposed the narrowness of his Soul, and the poor Ideas he had of Hu|mane
Nature, and even of the Character of a Gentleman by saying what
I have in p. 61. cited out of his Book of The Succession, viz. That many
Iealousies, Accusations and Calumniations must needs ght on the Party that
is of different Religion from the State and Prince under whom he lives.
As there is very little in this Discourse that reflects on any Principles of
the Romanists that may be called Religionary, so neither have I troubled
my self to attacque the Tenets of the Society of the Iesuites, and of other
Casuists condemned by this Pope, that do not hominum societatem convel|lere,
and it may well be supposed that I having partly grounded my Conje|ctures
of the happy Future State of England on the former fashion of Pole|mical
Writing being passed away, could not be much tempted to Contro|versy.
The Iesuites and Casuists may still hold the 23d Tenet branded in the
Pope's ecree as long as they will, without any disturbance from my
Pen, viz. Faith in its large sense only from the Evidence of the Creation,
or some such Motive is sufficient for Iustification, and so likewise the 46th
Tenet there, viz. frequent Confession and Communion even in those that live
as Heathens is a Mark of Predestination, and many other Tenets there re|lating
to Religion, and which the Pope with so great a Pastoral Sollicitude
hath damned as at least scandalous and pernicious in Practice, and hath
prohibited to be defended by any under the pain of Excommunication, ipso
facto.
But there are other Tenets by him in that Decree condemned, that I
have in this Discourse dilated on as Convulsive of Humane Society, which
the Pietas in patriam occasioned in me such transports of passion against,
that I wished he had signalized with sharper words of Censure than those

beforementioned, and that I thought the Excommunicatio Major with the
Ceremony of lighted Torches too little for, and even an ordinary Anathe|ma
in their case to be a Complement or a kind of sham censuring them
as abominable and not good, or somewhat like the Censure pro form shot
off against the Munster Peace: and I supposed that if he had Sentenced
them to be absolutely in themselves evil, he would have satisfied every
one that he had put the World out of their Gun-shot by his putting it
out of his power to dispense with them.
However finding that Decree of great moment to Christendom, and yet
by the generality of Papists or Protestants to have been not much more
regarded than are the Copies of the Dialogues between Pasquin and Marpho|rio
that come here, I have deliberately Surveyed it and done it what right
I could. And by occasion hereof do here call to mind a Remark on the
Papacy I met with in a Pamphlet of one of our Dissenters, viz. That if
the Pope were a good man, he might do a great deal of good.
Tho for sometime after I had begun this Discourse, I was somewhat a
Stranger to the great Character of the present Pope, (and so continued
till reading the Preface of Dr. Burnet's very learned Book of the Regale,
I sound he there Celebrated him in these words, viz. That he is a man of
great probity, and that on his advancement to the Papacy, he conceived a
very ill opinion of the whole Order of the Iesuites,) I since found cause
from the Universal Concurrence of all Impartial men about the same,
to have the firmer opinion of the quiet of England, and do expect from
the influences of such a Pope on the Loyalty and Religion of the Roman
Catholicks of England, some advance of its happiness.
Tho most men may have only little Ideas of the Deity as of somewhat
above the Clouds, that as a great Cypher only surrounds the World, yet
the wiser few who have particularly observed the watchful Eye of Provi|dence
over the Critical passages, and windings and turnings in their own
lifes, cannot but be sensible that in the designation of persons at stated
times to be at the Helm of the Church of Rome, (and who are necessa|rily
to have so great a share in the External, and a much greater in the In|ternal
Government of the World) the great Governor of it, and preser|ver
of men is no unconcerned Spectator.
It is (I think) most highly probable that at a time when the World
being filled with the Jesuites Principles and Casuistick distinctions, Vertue
it self was grown an empty Name, and the Casuists Project of finishing
Transgression, and making an end of Sin in a subtle way and contrary to
the plain Method intended by our Saviour, had in a great part of the
World almost finished the most Vital part of Christian Religion, I mean
plain and downright Morality, and at a time when some Virtuosi in Italy
and elsewhere half-witted and half Atheists taking it for granted that in
what hearts soever the Jesuites and Casuists Religionary Model had pre|vailed,
the simplicity of the Gospel was extinguished, were observed to
talk of Albumazar's fond prediction of the Christian Religion lasting but
about 1460 years, and Criticising of the time from whence its promul|gation
and likewise the promulgation of those Casuistical Tenets bore
date, did prophanely insinuate their Miscreant-Conceptions of the
Christian Religion not lasting till the time assigned in the Scripture for
Christs surrendring his Mediatory Kingdom to his Father. I say it is most
highly probable that at such a time (and when the Jesuites Interest too,
had so much Prosperity as to tempt them to think that the Mountain of
their Religion should never be moved) that nothing less than the great

Vertue and Courage of this Pope appearing by his said Decree could secure
Vertue it self and the true Christian Morality; and give the World occa|sion
to say with some Alteration of the Question put to Esther, viz. Who
knoweth not that he is come to Rome's See for such a time as this is?
The Mountainous heap of Rubbish in the Iesuites and other Casuists Prin|ciples
(and even in the Canon Law) appears very stupendious to the World,
but considering the Christian Heroical Acts of this Pope (and who for his
severity against the abuses of Indulgences, hath been by some Papists called
the Lutheran Pope (as I said) and for his anger against the Jesuites Prin|ciples
been called the Iansenist Pope by others) I think another great Que|stion
in the Prophet Zechary may be here not improperly applied, viz.
Who art thou O great Mountain before Zerubbabel?
Little did the Iesuites think that when they Crowned the Papacy with
a double Crown, I mean of its infallibility in Law and likewise in Fact (a
Crown much more glorious than its Triple one) any Pope would ever
uncrown their Principles and expose their baldness to the World: and lit|tle
do they who fear that ever this Pope will occasionally dispense with any
mens practising these Principles, think of the security they have against
the same from his inflexible Virtue and perfect Antipathy to injustice, and
which are judged to be so inherent in his Nature that I shall here occasi|onally
say that as I was somewhat a Stranger formerly to the Character of
this Pope, so I believe some of the Plot-witnesses were that reflected on
him so ignominiously: for undoubtedly had it been understood by them,
they would never have thought their Credibility could have out-lived
their first attacquing it.
It may possibly be here objected by some Critical Inspectors into the
late Papal Transactions that Alexander the 7th (as this Pope observes
in the beginning of his said Decree) did first damn some of the Ie|suites
Principles, viz. in the year 1665, and that Guymenius shortly after
in that year appearing in Print as a Champion for the Principles so damned,
the College of Sorbon shortly after that damned the Work of Guymenius in
the 11th of May the same year; and that in the latter end of Iune so short|ly
following in the same year, the same Pope Alexander the 7th, damned
that very Sorbon Censure of Guymenius; and that therefore 'tis possible the
great Scene of Vertue appearing in this Popes said Decree may with a short
turn of Apostolical Power receive too the Fate of Pageantry and presently
disappear, and that the great Mountain which his Faith hath removed into
the midst of the Sea, may in little more than the twinkling of an Eye
return to its old place.
But in Answer to which I shall do that right to the Papacy to clear the
mistake in the objection, and inform the Reader that tho Alexander the 7th
did Ex Cathedra, damn that Sorbon-Censure as aforesaid, yet it appears
out of the Condemnatory Bull it self, that what that Pope there did was
not out of favour to Guymenius or the Iesuites themselves or their Tenets:
and that to satisfie the World in that point he there gives the reason for
his damning the Sorbonists Censure, namely, because it intermedled in
Censuring some other Propositions or Principles of the Jesuites that con|cerned
the Authority of the Pope, the Iurisdiction of Bishops, the Office
of the Parish Priests, and the Privileges granted by Popes; and but for
the Sorbons complicating which with their Censure of the other Scandalous
Principles of the Iesuites, no doubt but the Sorbon Censure had stood as
a Rock unshaken.

Let therefore such who fear every thing, fear that this great Pope will
after his said Condemnatory Decree appear,  or Self-Con|demned,
while I observe it for the honour of his Iustice that he made
that Decree, and for the honour of his Prudence that before Nature
had caused the detestable Principles therein censured silently to evapo|rate,
he gave the World this loud warming of them, as it likewise may
be for the honour of that great Seminary of the Divines of our Church
of England, our University of Oxford observed, that before the Seditious
Principles and Tenets of Iesuites and some Dissenters came to be natural|ly
exterminated out of the English World by fear and shame, they notifi|ed
them to this Age, and to Posterity.
There is no Subject that hath since the year 1641, more employed the
English Press than that of Liberty of Conscience pro and con: and the
fiercest and sharpest of the Writings concerning it, were what passed be|tween
the Independents and Presbyterians on the occasion of Presbytery's
great Effort, to make the English Nation by one short general turn Pro|selyted
to its Model, and when it pushed for the auspicious fate of former
great Religionary Conversions happening as it were simul and semel, and
when Nations seemed to be like the Hyena, which having but one Back|bone
cannot turn except it turn all at once.
But the Independents observing the Kingdom and Presbytery frowning
on one another, thought they could do nothing more popular than to
take the Arguments they found in the many Pamphlets of the Presbyte|rians
lying on every Stall for toleration under the old Hierarchy, and
turn them upon Presbytery, and every one then who had fears and jealou|sies
of the Arbitrariness of Presbytery, seem'd to be a well wisher to
those Books for Liberty of Conscience; and the destroying of the Credit of
Presbytery by Books that had so much contentious fire in them, was real|ly
an acceptable sweet-smelling Sacrifice to the Nation.
And after the King's Restoration tho some few Books were writ of that
Subject (and with much more Candour than the others) yet the Yoke
of the King's Ecclesiastical Laws was so easie to the People, as that the
Writing of Books against it was not encouraged by Popular Applause.
The King's Declaration of Indulgence afterward appearing (and as
not gained by dint of Pen but ex mero motu) was applauded by some few
particular Writers among the Popish and Protestant Recusants discour|sing
in Print at their ease, of Liberty of Conscience.
But as if Nature meant that Books of that Subject should no more here
divert the curious World, the Empire toleration had thereby gained, did pre|sently
labour under its own weight, and the Non-Conformists being jealous
of that Declaration proving a President of the Prerogatives suspending
Acts of Parliament in general, and suspecting that the Popish Recusants
would have the better of that Game, as supposed to have many great
Court-Cards here and abroad in the World and likely to have more,
while the Protestant Recusants had not so good in their hands (tho yet
they had here what amounted to the point in Picquet, I mean the ad|vantage
of their Numbers) did presently thereupon cause all the Cards
to be thrown up: but first had in Concert with the dealers provided for
the packing them to their own advantage in a new Deal.
In plain English, some Loyal Persons and firm Adherents to the Church
of England in the House of Commons, thinking that Declaration illegal,
(and whether justly or no, I here presume not in the least to question)
endeavoured tanquam pro aris  focis to get that Declaration Cancell'd,

and knowing they could not effect the same without the help of the Dis|senters
Party in Parliament engaged their help therein, by giving them
hopes to carry an Act of Parliament for their Indulgence: but what a little
fore-sight would have made appear to them impossible to be gained, for
many Considerations too obvious to be named.
And the natural result of this Fact (which is on all hands confessedly
true) cannot but be the making of the former fashion of Polemical writing
for liberty of Conscience to pass away.
We have since seen some few Florid Sheets published by some of the
Dissenting Clergy on that Subject, but they have made no other Figure
then that of the poor Resemblances of Flowers extracted by Chimical Art
out of their Ashes: and any little shaking them in the Glass of Time must
make them presently fall in pieces.
I have in this Discourse expressly owned my having no regret against
any due or Legal Relaxation of the Penal Laws against Recusants: but
what any due or legal way may be therein, I enquire not.
The power of the King in dispensing with the Penalties in case of par|ticular
Persons was not (that I hear of) in the least Controverted in the
Debates of the Commons about that Declaration. And Fuller in his Church
History relateth, that when Bishop Williams was Lord-Keeper, there was a
Toleration granted under the Great Seal to Mr. Iohn Cotton a Famous Inde|pendent
Divine, for the free exercise of his Ministry notwithstanding his
dissenting in Ceremonies, so long as done without disturbance to the Church:
and the lawfulness of which particular Indulgence (I suppose) none in
that Age controverted, as I think none would any thing of that kind in
this.
But if this Question of Toleration had not here been at the end of its
Race, and if no such thing had happened as the Declaration of Indulgence,
and Dissenters thereby manumitted from Penal Laws saying, Soul take thy
ease,
and presently Acting the Part of felo de se, by effecting the Cancel|ling
of that Declaration, and if the Controversy were now to begin to start
forward, I account it would cause but a very short fermentation among
us.
For no Books need be writ to prove the lawfulness of what an Act of
Parliament hath permitted to every private Family, and to a cer|tain
number of other persons to participate therein with them. And if
Dissentership would now call for more Toleration, its very being called on
to name its Tenets in order o the security of the Government in grant|ing
it to more persons to assemble together in enjoying it, its very naming
them would (I believe) soon perimere litem in the Case: and some of
its Tenets would perhaps appear too little, and others too great to require
the formality of Debate.
It is even ridiculous to suppose that any Iesuites and Dissenters would
now dare to demand Toleration for the Principles of the Crown-Divinity of
each, mentioned in the Oxford Censure. None of them would now dare
to be Confessors of Religionary Principles that would make Kings Mar|tyrs.
And as I think that the Pope needed not crave Aid from his Vatican,
nor the Oxford-Convocation from their Bodleian Library to confute mon|strous
Tenets Condemned by either (for in this Case according to the
words of Tertullian advers. Valent. Demonstrare solummodo, destruere est)
so I likewise think that both Popish and Protestant Recusants will be asha|med
to crave Aid of Toleration from the Magistracy for Principles they

are ashamed to own, or indeed for any but what they shall first own, and
the rather when our Protestants shall recollect with what vigorous Expe|dition
the great Owners of that Name in Germany, published their Reli|gionary
Confessions, as Alsted tells us in his Chronlogia testium veritatis,
where he makes mention of the Augustan Confession, tendred to Charles
the 5th, and the States of the Empire in the year 1530, and of the
Confessio Suevica in the same year, and of the Confessio Basileensis in the
next year, and of the Confessio Helvetica in the year 1556, and of all the
other great Protestant Confessions exhibited severally to the World before
the year 1573.
Such of our Dissenters therefore who have to this year 1684, made it
their business to be Anti-Confessors by hiding many of the particularities
of their Principles, and giving the World cause perhaps to say, Difficilius
est invenre qum vincere, and who yet assume the name of Protestan|cy,
will perhaps hardly think it possible for them to gain Toleration for
their further being called by that Name, without shewing the Title
of their Principles to it.
As on the account of what I have said it would be a Persecution to the
World, for the most ingenious men to trouble it with Discourses of the
lawfulness of Toleration, so it would too be to trouble it with Discourses of
the unlawfulness of denying Toleration to men who either deny their Prin|ciples,
or deny to give an account of them: a duty that can plead as clear
a jus Divinum for it self as any Form of Church Government, and by
Vertue of which Christians are to be ready always to give an answer to eve|ry
man that asks them a reason of the hope that is in them, with meekness and
reverence.
There are some Principles to which it is by all agreed, that 'tis unlaw|ful
to give Toleration, namely, to those that disturb Civil Society; nor
would it appear otherwise than ridiculous to the hoodwink't sober Party
of any Sect, that when the Magistrates reprove them in those words of
our Saviour, yee worship yee know not what, the Magistrates by tolera|ting
them at that time should give cause to others to tell them, yee tole|rate
yee know not what.
I have observed it in the Course of my reading, that there is one great
point of Religion on which the hinge of Loyalty doth very much turn,
that several Eminent Papists and Non-Conformists, have not dared to speak
their plain agreed sense of, and as to which it may therefore seem very
rational that they should, and that is, How far the Civil Laws of Princes
or the Municipal Laws do bind the Conscience, a Point that the Council of
Trent could not be brought to Define; and herein 'tis obvious to consider
that tho 'tis on all hands granted that in any thing contrary to the Divine
Law natural and positive, those Laws do not bind the Conscience, and
that the jus Divinum of the Papacy, Presbytery, or Independency would
not be caught with a why not, on the holding the Question in the Affirma|tive,
that Humane Laws do bind the Conscience in things not contrary
to the Law Divine, yet are the Adherents to those Religionary Models con|scious
to themselves, that in many particulars necessary to bring them in|to
practice, there must be a Sanction of thm by Penal Municipal Laws,
and they hoping to have the Magistracy and its Power on their side, and
to Act in Concert with them according to that Saying of the Emperor to
his Bishop, Iungamus gladios, and knowing that the Authority of the
Magistrate to support both Religion and Loyalty, and for the Custody of
 Tables, hath as clear a jus Divinum as their Plat-forms can have,

and that therefore the Civil Power  not let its jure-Divinity be taken
too by any with a why not (as it would be if the Question were held who|ly
in the Negative) they have in their Writings been generaly obscure
and short in that point, and have hoped by their power and interest to
keep the World from calling on them to explain.
But I have in my occasional Converse with some of the most learned
of the Non-Conforming Clergy observed them in Discourse to speak out
their minds plainly and Categorically enough that Humane Laws do not
bind the Conscience, and to account it an absurd thing to make any Penal
Law bind the Conscience even in matters purely Civil, and wherein there
is no pretence of any things enjoyned concerning the Worship of God,
and yet where the things under Penalties enjoyned are of great impor|tance
to the State.
The men of somewhat hot rather then distinguishing heads, tho they
know that Humane Laws are necessarily Penal, and tho they believe that
Oeconomics do best subsist by their Wives and Children and Servants, be|ing
bound to observe those their lawful Commands by the Tye of Reli|gion
that they intended should be effectually obeyed, have not consider|ed
that Politicks would likewise thereby be best preserved, nor learned to
distinguish the Penal Laws where the Magistrate intended to oblige the
Subject in point of Fault, and where only in point of the Penalty: but
our clear-headed and loyal hearted Sanderson who may well come under
the account of  as to those Opiners, hath for the honour of the
Church of England's Principles in his 8th Lecture (and there de lege pae|nali)
well taught us in what Cases Penal Laws oblige in Conscience; and
shewed that they may so bind where the Legislator did intend to oblige
the Subject Ad culpam etiam  non solum ad paenam: and in that
Case saith he, Certum est eos teneri ad observandum id quod lege praecipitur,
nec satisfacere officio si parati sint poenam lege constitutam subire, and where
he further saith, That the mind and intention of the Legislator is chiefly
seen in the Proeme of his Law, in quo (saith he there) ut acceptior sit
populo lex, solet Legislator Consilii sui de e lege ferend causas,  ratio|nes
expoee qum sit lex iusta, quam fuerit tollendis incommodis  abusibus
necessaria, qum futura sit Reip. utilis.
There is a particular Principle of moment worthy of the Magistrates
Survey, that relates to the Gathered Churches, and that is a Principle
made a necessary ingredient in the Constitution of of those Churches by
a Divine of the same Authority among them, as Bishop Saerson is in
the Church of England, and whom I occasionally beforementioned, and
that is Mr. Iohn Cotton B. D. who in a Pamphlet of his printed at London
in the year 1642 Enttuled. The true Constitution of a particular visible
Church proved by Scripture, wherein is briefly demonstrated by Questions and
Answers, what Officers, Worship and Government Christ hath ordained in
his Church (and in the Title-page whereof is this place of Scripture, viz.
Jer. 50. 5. They shall ask the way to Sion with their faces thitherward,
saying Come let us joyn our selves to the Lord in a perpetual COVENANT
that shall not be forgotten) in p. 1st, makes his first Question, what is a
Church? And the Answer is, The Church is a mystical Body whereof Christ
is the head; the Members and Saints called out of the World and united toge|ther
in one Congregation by an holy COVENANT, to Worship the Lord and
to Edifie one another in all his holy Ordinances.
And in another Book of his printed at London in the year 1645 called,
The way of the Churches of Christ in New England, his third Proposition is

this, viz. For the joyning of faithful Christians into the Fellowship and Estate
of a Church, we find not in Scripture that God hath done it any other way
than by entring of them all together (as one man) into an holy COVENANT
with himself to take the Lord (as the head of the Church) for their God
and to give up themselves to him to be his Church and People: which implies
their submitting of themselves to him, and one to another in his fear, and their
walking in professed subjection to all his Ordinances, their cleaving one to ano|ther
as fellow Members of the same Body in Brotherly Love and Holy Watch|fulness
unto Mutual Edification.
He there partly props up the Obligation of this Church Covenant on
the Iewish Oeconomy mentioned in the Book of Deuteronomy and other
places of the Old Testament.
The reasonableness of Subjects not entring into Religionary Covenants
without the Consent of the Pater patriae, may be inferred from the old
Testament, where in Numbers c. 30 the Parent hath a power given for
the controuling of the Childrens Vows not enter'd into by his consent;
but since these Principles of a new Church Covenant may seem to intro|duce
a new Ecclesiastical Law without the King's privity and consent (a
thing that if our very Convocation should presume to do, would bring
them within a Praemunire,) and since the whole power of reforming and
ordering of all matters Ecclesiastical is by the Laws in express words an|nexed
to the Imperial Crown of this Realm (and particularly by the 1st of
Elizabeth) and since that it hath been said, that even without an Act of
Parliament, a new Oath or Covenant cannot be introduced among the
King's Subjects, and moreover since all the famous Religionary Confessi|ons
of the Protestant Churches abroad, assert nothing of any such Church
Covenant, and since Covenants and Associations have lately heard so ill in
the Kingdom, I think the nature and terms of this Independent Covenant
ought to be laid as plain before the Eye of the Government as was the
Scotch Presbyterian one.
Those words of Mr. Cotton of the entring them all together as one man
into an holy Covenant, carry some thing like the same sound of one and all,
and tho their thus entring into it to take the Lord as the head of his Church
for their God, and to give up themselves to him to be his Church and People,
may be a plausible beginning of this new Church Covenant in nomine Do|mini,
yet the following words, of submitting themselves to him and to one
another in his fear, and their cleaving one to another as fellow Members of the
same Body in Brotherly Love and Holy Watchfulness, are words that (I
think) the Magistracy ought to watch, and to see that Dissenters have a
very sound form of words prescribed to them in this Case, if it shall
think fit to have the same continued.
I have found the Assertion of a Church Covenant as Essential to the
Form of a true Independent Church in many other of their Books, and do
suppose that this Covenant being laid as Corner-stone in the building of
their Churches by Divine Right, it must last as long as Independency it
self: and of its lasting still, I met with an Indication from a Loyal and
Learned Official of the Court-Christian, who told me that tho several of
the Dissenters called Presbyterians have been easily perswaded to repair to
the Divines of the Church of England that they were admonished to confer
with, and had upon Conference with them come to Church and took the
Sacrament, yet he thought that some of another Class of Dissenters were
possessed with a Spirit of incurable Contumacy, by reason of their Princi|ples
having tied them together to one another by a Covenant.

And if it shall therefore appear to the Magistrates that they are thus
Conference-proof and (as I may say) Reason-proof by vertue of their Co|venant,
it will then be found that no one Mmber of a gathered Church
can turn to ours, without the whole Hyena-like turning, and perhaps
some of the Lords the Bishops may think it hereupon proper humbly to
advise his Majesty to null by a Declaration the Obligation of this Cove|nant
as his Royal Father did that of the Presbyterian Covenant.
In the mean time the Consideration of the Principles of Independecy
thus seeming to have cramp'd the Consciences of its followers with a Cove|nant
(that is at least unnecessary, and must naturally be a troublesom impo|sition
to men of thought and generous Education who love to perform
Moral Offices without entring into Covenant or giving Bond so to do)
may serve to let men see how the Pastorage of the Church of England
treats them like Gentlemen, and may serve to awaken their Compassion
for their deluded Country-men whom they see frghtened by their Teach|ers
into a fancy of the unlawfulness of a Ceremony, and yet embolden'd
by them into the belief and practice of a Covenant without the King's
Consent, and from which Persons we should perhaps quickly receive
Alarms of Persecution, if the Government should impose any Covenant
or Test on them in order to Loyalty, tho never so necessary for the pub|lick
Peace.
But the World is aweary of the umbrage Sedition hath found among
denominations of Churches, and of judging of Trees by their Shadows, or
otherwise than by their Fruit, that is by their Principles: and for the hap|piness
of the present State of England, after we have by many Religion-Traders
been troubled with almost as many Marks of true and false
Churches as there are of Merchants Goods, Nature seems to have direct|ed
the People to agree in this indeleble Character and Mark of a false
Church, namely, one whose Principles are Disloyal.
The Genius of England is so bent upon Loyalty in this Conjuncture,
that a disloyal Principle doth jar in the Ears of ordinary thinking men
like a false string in the Ears of a Critical Lutenist, and the which he
knows that Art or Nature can never tune: and upon any Churches va|luing
themselves on the intrinsic worth or the weight of their Princi|ples
as most opposite to Falshood, men generally now take into their
hands the Touch-stone and the Scales of Loyalty, and do presently suspect
any Church that refuseth to bring its Principles to be touch'd and weigh'd,
and they will not now allow the Reputation of a visible Church to any
body of Men, whose Principles relating to Loyalty, shall not first be made
visible.
Nor can it be otherwise thought by the impartial, than that Mens
Consciousness of somewhat of the Turpitude of some of their Principles,
restrains them from bringing them to appear in publick View, and accor|ding
as Cicero in his de fin. bon.  mal. answers Epicurus (who said that
he would not publish his Opinion lest the people might perhaps take of|fence
at it,) viz. Aut tu eadem ista dic in judicio, aut si coronam times,
dic in senatu. Nunquam facies. Cur; nisi quod turpis est Oratio.
I who thus urge the Reasonableness and Necessity of mens being Con|fessors
of their Principles of Loyalty, have frankly exposed one of mine own
in p. 131. and which I say there that I account the great fundamental one
for the quiet of the World as well as of a Man's own Conscience, viz.
That no man is warranted by any Intention of advancing Religion, to invade
the right of the Sovereign Power that is inherent in Princes by the munici|pal

Laws of their Countreys: and I have mention'd the same in p. 136.
as owned by the Non-conforming Divines in King Iames his time.
Tho I believe as firmly as any man, that the Christian Religion doth
plainly forbid the Resistance of Authority, and that his Majesties Royal
Power is immediately from God and no way depends on any previous E|lection
or Approbation of the people, yet since the Sons of the Church
of England are sufficiently taught both that Doctrine, and likewise that
human Laws in the point of their Allegiance do bind the Conscience, and
since other men who err in Principles of Loyalty may sooner be brought to
see the Absurdity of their Error by the known Laws of the Land, than
by Argumentations from Scripture which may admit of Controversy,
and since his Majesty hath been pleased to expect the Measures of our O|bedience
from the Laws, and that our English Clergy while in the late
Conjuncture they have so universally preach'd up Loyalty, have so religi|ously
accorded with the Measures of the Laws, and have therein (as I may
say) shewed themselves Apostolical Pastours, and since the persons whose
Complaints of the danger of Popery are most loud, do joyn therewith their
Exclamations against Arbitrary or Illegal Power, and seem to joyn Issue in
the point that they are willing that the Power that is by Law inherent in
the Crown should be preserved to it, I thought it most useful in the present
Conjuncture to assert the Principle in these Terms I have done: and I the
rather chose to do it, because I thought that the security of the Crown is by
some Laws well provided for, whose Obligation admits of no Doubt, I mean,
those whereby Men have been obliged to take the Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy.
But moreover as I consider'd it to be one great valuable Right inherent
by Law in our Princes to secure the Continuance of the Succession in their
Line, so I likewise judged the legal Right of Princes to Succeed according
to Proximity of Blood, to be unalterable, and therefore having my eye on
the prevention of further Scandal to Protestancy from the Exclusion,
I introduced that Principle so worded as aforesaid, that by dilating there|on
as I have done, I might bring the Reader the better prepared to my Ca|suistical
Discussion of the Oaths.
The Reader will find at the end of this Discourse the Casuistical Discus|sion
of the Obligation to the King's Heirs and Successors resulting from
the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, by me promised in p. 214, and
the occasion of my writing which is likewise there mentioned.
It was wholly writ in the time that the Question of the Succession made
the greatest noise among us and was then by me Communicated to seve|ral
of my Friends in Terms as herewith printed without any thing since
added or diminished, and both it and the Discourse (which contains so many
things naturally Previous to the Consideration of that Question) would
have been long since published but partly for the various Accidents of
Business and Sickness that necessarily interrupted me in the Writing of
the latter.
And tho perhaps the Publication of the former in the time of the Ses|sions
of our late Parliaments, might have been more significant, than af|ter
the Volly of Loyal Addresses shot of manifesting the general just
zeal against the Exclusion (of which Addresses I yet observed none to
mention any thing of the Obligations to Allegiance to the King's Heirs
and Successors from the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy) it may be
said that the subsequent Births of Fate have not restrained the
possibility of its usefulness in future times: and tho Heaven may be

propitious to our Land in the blessing it according to the Loyal Style of
the Addresses, namely, in his Majesties Line continuing on the English
Throne as long as the Sun and Moon endure, yet many and many may be
the Conjunctures when a supposed Heterodox Prince shining like the Sun
in the Firmament of the English State, and regularly moving in the Line
of the Law and his own Religion, may attract the dull Vapours of Fears
and Jealousies again, as another glorious Prince hath done, and the exhala|tions
of which may cast such Mists before Mens understanding Faculties
as to hinder them from seeing their way in the observance of the Oaths
they took: and therefore as a  or premuniment (as I call'd it)
against our being future Enemies to our selves, and against poor little
Mortals (as it were) standing for the Office of Conservators of Gods
glory, while they are losing their own Souls by Perjury, and against some
Loyal Timid People troubling themselves with falling Skies and fears of
Gods not upholding his Church (just as Galen tells us of a Melancholy
Man who by often reading it in the Poets how Atlas supported Heaven
with his Shoulders, was often in a Panic fear least Atlas should faint and
let Heaven fall on mens heads) instead of taking pains to uphold and
maintain their Oaths which they swore to God in Truth and Righteous|ness,
it may perhaps be always of importance to our English World to
have right Notions of the Obligation of those Oaths left behind in
it.
When I have read many of the late Pamphlets against the Succession
(the Venom of which was stolen out of Doleman's alias Parson's Book)
and have often considered that the Government in King Iames's time
might well be apprehensive of the mischief that Book might do with
its Poyson, and perhaps with its Sting in following Ages, I have then won|dered
why none was employed to Answer it throughly, a thing that I do
not find was ever done, unless it may be said that an Answer to the 1st
part of it was in the year 1603 published by Sir Iohn Haward, and that
its 2d part hath been confuted by some Loyal and Learned Persons since
the late Conjuncture of our Fermentation, and in which time that Book
of Parsons was Reprinted.
I am sorry that that Book and some others of Father Parsons were in
some part of King Iames's time Answered as they were by the real Cha|racters
of severity that then fell on some innocent Papists, and who (I
believe) were Abhorrers of the Sedition his Books contained, and on
whom Dr. Donne's Pseudo-Martyr, printed in the year 1610, reflects in
The Advertisement to the Reader saying. That his continual Libels and in|citatory
Books have occasioned more afflictions, and drawn more of that Blood
which they call Catholick, than all our Acts of Parliament have done.
And with a just respect to the Learning in Sir Iohn Haward's Answer
to the first part of that Book, and by him Dedicated to King Iames, it
may yet be wished that with less Pomp of Words and greater closeness
of Argument referring to the Principles of internal Justice and natural
Allegiance and the lex terrae, he had shewn the perfect unlawfulness of de|feating
the Title of Proximity of Blood in the Case, and instead of so
much impugning the Book by References to the Civil Law, and old Greek
and Latin Authors making for Monarchy in general, or even by the places
cited out of the old Testament favouring primogeniture: and indeed I do
not find among all our late Writers for the Succession, that so much as
one of them by so much as once quoting this Book of Sir Iohn Haward
(tho so common) hath thence brought any Aid to their Noble Cause.

But however the Oath of Allegiance having been enjoyned since the
writing of Sir Iohn Haward's Book hath given an ordinary Writer the ad|vantage
of bringing the Cause of the unlawfulness of disturbing the Course
of Succession to a quicker hearing and speedier issue in the Court of Con|science,
which is the point I have endeavoured to carry after the end of
this Discourse, leaving it to Candid Men to judge of the sincerity of my
performance therein, and of my fair stating of the Question and the de|ducing
genuine Propositions from it so stated, and which shall yet be re|viewed
by me when I come to Review this Discourse.
The truth is when I began it, I observed the generality of Men who
writ against the Exclusion-Bill with a great deal of good Law, History
and State-policy, did shew both their Learning and their Loyalty, and did
very usefully set forth the dreadful Confusions it would introduce and
perpetuate in the State: and the Illegality and indeed Nullity of any Ex|clusion
(tho by Act of Parliament) was by them likewise usefully shewn:
but yet I think it would have been some scandal to the present Age if it
had passed away without transmitting to the next some instances of Pro|testants
who had leisure to write, writing of the unlawfulness of such a
Bill with relation to our Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; and I was
sorry to find that when the late Loyal and Learned Bishop of Winchester had
afterward appear'd as the first Dvine who in Print asserted, That the Ex|clusion
of the Right Heir was contrary to the Law of God both Natural and Posi|tive,
and that such Exclusion was against the Law of the Land also, his judgment
in his Book called the Bishop of Winchester's Vindication given so Learnedly
in the point, seemed to so many of our new pretenders to Loyalty and to
Conformity to the Church of England, to be a kind of a Novelty.
But yet I observed that that Learned Prelate thought not fit there to
strengthen his Assertion of the unlawfulness of such Exclusion, by the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy.
Nor did I observe that among all the Loyal Writers for the Succession,
I had met with from first to last, any one had surveyed the Question of the
unlawfulness of the Exclusion resulting from our Obligation by the Oaths
of Allgiance and Supremacy, (tho yet some few of them hinted the thing
in general and were still answered with the haeres viventis) till at last ano|ther
Divine, namely, Dr. Hicks, Vicar of All hallows Barking and Dean
of Worcester, honoured both himself and the Question by taking notice of
it in his Iovian, and in the Preface to a Sermon of his printed in the year
1684, and Entituled, The harmony of Divinity and Law in a Discourse
about not resisting Sovereign Princes: and he in the 3d p. of that Preface
observes, That some men did pervert the meaning of the word Heirs in the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, from its common and usual acceptation to
another more special, on purpose to elude the force and obligation of them,
which otherwise they must have had upon the Consciences of the Excluders
themselves.
The Doctor had made himself Master of Law enough to Master the
true notion of the point, and did in his Preface exorcise the Fantom of hae|res
viventis, a Noon-day Spright raised by one who was thought a great Con|jurer,
and which had before haunted the Question, and had affrighted so
many from lodging their thoughts in it.
And tho no other of our Divines (that I have heard of) writ of the
same, nor any of the Layety otherwise than starting the Notion of it in
Print, yet considering the great weight of his Learning and Reason with
which in his Iovian and that Preface he directed so many in the Obligation

of their great Oaths, I will so far prefer his Labours to all that writ be|fore
of the Succession, as to say of him in those words of the Apostle,
He hath laboured more abundantly than they all.
That which I have writ thereof was finished some years before what
the Doctor published about the same, as several of my friends know, to
whom I gave Copies of the same, and with an injunction of printing it,
in Case of my death: and I have since added nothing to what I writ, nor
shall till I proceed to the Review of the Discourse: but had otherwise for
the honour of my judgment, therein concurring with so learned a mans,
respectfully cited somewhat thereof in my Discussion.
No doubt but there were many loyal and judicious and learned men
that in the late Conjuncture had the same sense with the Doctor, con|cerning
the Obligation of those Oaths, tho they had not time to publish
the same by the Press; and I have in p. 269 referred to what a very
learned and honourable Person urged from the Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy, in his Speech against the Exclusion-Bill in the House of Com|mons,
and to which I have mentioned somewhat of a reply there made
by Sir W. I. in that House, and of the prodigious Applause that Reply
found from many Persons there.
But in that Speech of Sir W. I. there was another thing said, and which
being spread about the Kingdom, had the effect of Thunder from an Ora|cle,
and kept thousands from daring so much as to deliberate of the Ob|ligations
resulting from the Oath of Allegiance, to oppose the Exclusion.
His words I refer to for this, were to this purpose, viz. It is urged also
that we are sworn to the King his Heirs and lawful Successors. It is true
we are so: but not obliged to any during the Kings life but to himself. For
it were Treason if it were otherwise.
It was in vain at that time for any Discourser to hope by fair and gentle
Principles of Reason to open the Wards in the Locks of Mens Consci|ences,
and to let in there a true Sense of the Allegiance sworn to the Kings
Heirs and Successors, when so great a Pick-lock of the Law had made it
Treason.
Yet never was I mortified with a greater Example of Humane Frailty
than by the Sense of so great a number of knowing Persons in that Loyal
Parliament being so suddenly infected with the Error of that Insinuation,
from a single Demagogue who had never been bred up to Logic, which yet
caught the understandings of the Majority of the Representatives of the
Commons of England, in the Trap of a little Sophism; and when an ordina|ry
Lease drawn by a Lawyer's Clerk might shew one that the Lessee at the
time of the perfecting it, actually enters into a present Obligation both
in Law, Equity and Conscience to pay his Rent to the Lessor his Heirs and
Assigns as it shall become due to each respectively, and which when the
Lessor dies or assigns his interest, is to be paid to the Heir and Assign
then and not till then.
But as Tully who had as great a Veneration for the Constitution of the
Roman Government, as I have for that of our English one, said in his Ora|tion
pro L. Murena, that Nihil est fallacius Ratione tot Comitiorum, the
same thing may happen to our great Loyal Body of Men assembled
while under a ferment of Passion; and then every mans anger influencing
another, Fallacy it self may pass for Reason: and as we see when many
Workmen are at once altogether crying, and pulling a great piece of Tim|ber
forward to them with a Rope, if that doth not hold but break, they
all fall backwards together, so when any Caetus or Body of Men are

drawing with all their strength to bring any matter of weight in the Go|vernment
to them, if the Principle of Reason they use for that purpose
will not hold, but proves a poor weak Sophism, they naturally fall down
together.
I have in this Discourse usually mentioned those Parliaments with the
prefixt name of Loyal, wherein I yet thought so many Persons were so
dreadfully mistaken in so great a point, and for which Charity (if extra|vagant)
no Iesuited Papists can blame me, knowing how great an Ex|clusioner
of old their infallible head hath been: but which I was the ra|ther
inclined to do (as any one may guess by the Current of the Discourse)
because I knew not but his Majesty's calling a New Parliament at
such time as he should think convenient for the same, might give many
of the mistaken Persons such an advantage of recollected thoughts as
would shew them the Errors of their former measures, and render them
afterwards averse from putting at once both their own Consciences, and
the very words of the Oath of Allegiance on the Rack, and from such a
squeezing of Blood out of that, contrary to the Grammatical Sense that
might occasion the flowing of blood through the Kingdom in after
times: and the sharpest expression I was naturally led to use where|upon,
fell from me without any Reproach of the Persons erring when I
said in p. 209, viz. Thus just is it for Heaven sometimes to blind and con|found
good men in their Counsels, when they abandon plain Principles and
Dictates of Reason, and when they will not do what they know, to suffer them
not to know what they do, c.
I have somewhere read of one who writing of the Constitution of and
Rule for the Franciscans, saith, That for the firmer observance of that
Rule Christ himself was heard in the Air, saying to St. Francis, This
Rule is mine and not thine, and I will have it observed, Ad literam, ad li|teram,
sine gloss, sine gloss: and let any men be attentive to the voice
behind them, viz. That of Conscience about the Rule of the observing of
their Oaths, they will hear God there speaking much to the same pur|pose.
Nor have I heard of the understandings of men of great Abilities
made Spectacles of shame to the World through the Divine Dereliction
in any particular point, more than in that relating to their natural Alle|giance
and their Oath to confirm it.
Let any one consider somewhat in the Speech of Sir H. V. printed in
the year 1662, As what he intended to speak on the Scaffold, where having
mentioned by what steps he became satisfied with the Parliaments Cause he
was engaged in, and did pursue the same, and that the Parliaments Cause
did first shew it self in the Remonstrance, and Secondly, in the Solemn
League and Covenant, he addeth, That it shewed it self, Thirdly, in the
more refined pursuit of it by the Commons House in their Actings single, and
saith afterward referring to my Lord of Arguile, viz. That Noble Person
(whose Memory I honour) was with my self at the beginning and making of
the Solemn League and Covenant, the matter of which and the holy ends
therein contained I fully assent unto and have been as desirous to observe,
but the rigid way of prosecuting it and the oppressing uniformity that have
been endeavoured by it, I never approved. This were sufficient to vindicate
me from the false Aspersions and Calumnies which have been laid upon me of Ie|suitism
and Popery, c. And recollect whether (tho that Covenant was con|trary
to the Oath of Allegiance) any thing yet could be more contrary
to that Covenant than that House of Coons acting single, or any thing

could be more contrary to the plain literal Sense of the Covenant, than
that refined pursuit of the Cause, owned by a person of such refined and
real great Abilities, and within the Prospect of Eternity: and whether the
owning of the same then contrary to the literal Sense of the Covenant
was a proper Medium for him to use then, whereby to clear himself from
the aspersion of Iesuitism?
There was another person of great Theological Learning and strong
natural parts who lived about that time, I mean Mr. Iohn Goodwin, the Di|vine
I before mentioned: and who in two Books of his, the one called
Redemption Redeem'd, and the other of The Divine Authority of the Scrip|ture
hath signaliz'd his great Abilities: but in the very Pamphlet where
he presumes to vindicate the very Sentence against the Royal Martyr, and
to make the same Coherent with the Scotch Covenant, he in p. 51 saith,
Evident it is that those Words in the Covenant, in the preservation and de|fence
of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdom, import a Condi|tion
on the Kings part, without the performance whereof the Covenant obligeth
no man to the preservation or defence of his Person or Authority: and yet al|lowing
the Words to speak for themselves, they do not say in HIS Pre|servation
and Defence, c. but in THE Preservation and Defence, c.
plainly referring to the same Preservation and Defence of Religion and Li|berties
which is before promised, and sworn to in this and the preceding
Articles, as evidently referring to the same Persons Preservation and De|fence
of them here who are to preserve and defend them in the former
Clauses, and who are to preserve and defend the Kings Majesty's Person
and Authority in this, namely, the Covenanters.
If the Covenant had intended to ground the Preservation and Defence
in this Clause upon another Person or Persons as the performers, beside
those to whom the same Actions are referred immediately before, it
would have pointed them out distinctly: but when it expresseth no other,
the plain ordinary Grammatical construction will attribute them to the
Parties before nominated, and cannot put them on any other.
And the Premisses notwithstanding Mr. Goodwin concludes that if that
his Anti-Grammatical Paraphrase were not the true meaning of those
words beforementioned in the Covenant, it was unintelligible by him: and
his Words are these, If this be not the clear meaning and importance of them,
the Covenant is a Barbarian to me, I understand not the English of
it.
Thus naturally is it even for the learned and unstable to wrest not only
the Scriptures but even their own subscribed Covenants, where the words
have no , to their own destruction and the destroying of common
Sense, when they recede from the common Principles of Loyalty and Al|legiance.
There was likewise another Person reputed one of first-rate Parts and
great Learning in the late times, who published a Book called, The lawful|ness
of obeying the present Government: and in his 11th Page there directs
the World to make this Enquiry, viz. Whether there be any Clause in any
Oath or Covenant which in a fair and common sense forbids obedience to the
Commands of the present Government and Authority: and referreth parti|cularly
to the Clause of the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, in the for|mer
of which 'tis said I shall bear faith and true Allegiance to his Majesty,
his Heirs and Successors, and in the latter. I shall bear faith and true Al|legiance
to the Kings Highness his Heirs and Successors.

He there goeth on very Childishly to sell the World a Bargain, by
trying to puzzle it with Questions, viz. If it be said that in the Oath of
Allegiance, Allegiance is sworn to the King his Heirs and Successors, if his
Heirs be not his Successors, how doth that Oath bind? Either the Word
Successors (saith he) must be superfluous, or it must bind to Successors as
well as to Heirs. And if it bind not to a Successor as well as to an Heir,
how can it bind to an Heir that is not a Successor? And if you will know
the common and usual sense (which should be the meaning of an Oath) of the
word Successors, you need not so much ask of Lawyers and Learned Persons,
as of men of ordinary knowledge, and demand of them who was the Successor
of William the Conqueror, and see whether they will not say W. Rufus: and
who succeeded Richard the Third, and whether they will not say Harry the
7th: and yet neither of them was Heir: so in ordinary acception the
word Successor is taken for him that actually succeeds in the Government, and
not for him that is actually excluded.
May we not to this Questionist who was as I may say such a Mountebank
of a Casuist, put the Question of Tertullian, Rideam vanitatem, an ex|probrem
caecitatem? And may we not properly bring in St. Austin's Casui|stical
Decision as to things of this Nature, Haec tolerabilius vel ridentur, vel
flentur, i. e. A man is at liberty either to laugh at or lament them.
I have in p. 41 of this Discourse mentioned D' Ossat's Observation of
Father Parson's often contradicting himself, and that very grossly in his Book
of the Succession, as it happens to all Persons in passion as able as they are who
are not guided by truth and reason, but transported by interest and pas|sion:
and I shall here further remark out of the same Letter of D' Ossat
by me there cited, that to those words last mentioned he there adds this,
viz. I will here name two of his Contradictions. He opposeth to the King of
Scots among other things to exclude him from the Succession of England, That
he was born out of England of Parents not subject to the Crown of England.
He likewise opposeth to Arabella among other impediments, That she is a
Woman, and that it is not expedient for the Kingdom of England to have
three Women, Queens successively: and that often the Children of Kings have
been excluded for being Women: and yet not withstanding he adjudgeth the
said Kingdom to the Infanta of Spain, by preference even to the King of Spain,
her Brother, as if the said Infanta were not a Woman as well as the said Ara|bella.
I had almost forgot to observe how the Author of The lawfulness of obey|ing
the present Government, that useth such thick paint of Equivocation
in his sense of the word Successors, having pushed on his Question about
any Clause in any Oath or Covenant forbidding obedience to the present Go|vernment
and Authority, by adding to it the consideration of obeying it,
when no other Government can be had, and of the Common-wealths going to
ruine, if the present Government were not obeyed, and having there|by
insinuated that the Obligation of the Oath ceased, was so horribly impo|litick
as to prop up that insinuation by a passage cited for that purpose out
of a Popish Casuist, who saith, That when a thing sworn is too difficult, or
he that swore is by change of Abilities or Estate rendred less apt to perform:
or lastly, when the thing sworn is an hinderance to the swearer from consulting
the publick good, then there is a lawful Cause of DISPENSING in the
Oath.
We have here then found a Protestant and a Casuist-would-be exalting
himself above all that is called God to Dispense with Oaths, a thing that
Protestancy abhorreth, and a thing that the Oath had precluded in these

words, I do believe and in Conscience am resolved that neither the Pope nor
any other Person whatsoever hath power to absolve me of this Oath, or any part
thereof.
Thus as the Author hath by his interpretation of the word Successor,
qualified an Vsurper to have the benefit of the Oath of Allegiance to our
lawful Monarch, so he hath bare-faced made himself Successor to the Pope,
and an Vsurper upon Oaths by dispensation.
More instances need not be given of the hortor of Heavens withdraw|ing
its ordinary influences from particular men of extraordinary parts,
who after they have despised Dominions and Dignities and their Oaths to
them, would be Critical inventors of new Rules concerning the Alle|giance
to Kings and the Oaths about the same, but who have thereby ap|peared
more despicable than the Pedants who call themselves Criticks, whose
skill in the Minutiae of words or trivial Niceties in the learned Languages
hath yetsecured their pride from being humbled by erring in the sense of
words in their Mother Tongue.
When I was writing the former part of the following Discourse out of
my just Compassion to my Country, as well as to the Noble Lord and
others, who suffered so unjustly by Oaths Assertory in the time of the
Martyrocrasy (as I called it) when every single Witness was almost as
considerable as Ingulfus the Abbot of Crowland, Confessor to William the
Conqueror was in his time (of whom it was said, that Quo voluit humi|liavit,
 quos voluit exaltavit;) and when if the number of Witnesses
had continued to encrease and swarm as it began, it would in time have
scarce left any to be Judges or Jurors, and when some of them who were
bread-worshippers, were yet almost as much adored by the Mobile of Pro|testants
as the Host is by the Papists, I had thoughts to have entertained
our English World with an account of the particularities of the usage that
Witnesses in the Case of Treason find in the World abroad, and to have
shewed how the Custom and Practice of Nations and their Laws have
with all the Critical Nicety of Politicks imaginable provided that such
Witnesses may neither be too much discouraged by fears nor encouraged
by hopes, and that it frequently there happened that in the discharge of
the Office of Witnessing, men were to expect so great an allay of trouble,
and so much exposed to depend on the next World for the reward of
their Veracity in this, as to prevent in this an allay of truth with falshood
in their Testimony, and that sometimes when Paupers come to be Wit|nesses
in Criminal Causes, they have not Beds of Roses provided for
them, but are put to the Rack, and that ordinarily the bodies of such
Witnesses are acked on their being found vacillant and halting in their
Testimony, and whereby they had given Iudges occasion to think that
such Witnesses had first tried the Rack upon their Souls and Conscien|ces.
But tho I thought any Scene of that would appear horrid to an English
Eye, as it doth to the Eye of our Laws, I have yet in this Discourse men|tioned
how the Iewish Law by God's express Command took care to pre|vent
mens ambitus in standing for the Office of Witnesses, by tacking there|unto
the standing Office of Executioners, and I have in my Notions of in|famous
Witnesses exactly accorded with the Justice of our English Laws,
our lex terrae being the allowed Land-mark for all to go by in matters judi|cial:
and I have endeavoured by that to stop the Course of an infamous
Person, when from an Accuser he would presently grow to be a Witness
and  Serpente factus Draco, or as I may say, be always growing in Arbitrary

Accusation, and like a Crocodile never come to his full growth; and I have
not robbed him of his right of being an informer in Cases where the lives
of Princes are concerned: and have moreover represented such a Malefactor
capable by his penitence and subservience to the great influx of Providence
on the safety of Crown'd Heads, of being thought his Countries Benefa|ctor
and a piece of a Founder to it, and could have gone no higher without
following our profanum vulgus in making every Informer and Witness a Sa|viour,
a word that Cicero was much scandalized at and taxed Vrres about,
because he found him at Syracuse written , a Saviour, and said that
the Style of such an one could not be expressed in one Latin word.
I have moreover fairly stated how and when, and by what exercises
performed relating to Moral Philosophy, an infamous Person may as a
Witness commence graduate in Credibility.
But Moribus antiquis stat Res Britannica, and so I desire it may while
the World stands; and as I have occasionally mentioned Boccaline's Cha|racter
of the best Reformer, viz. One who leaves the World as he finds it, so
I have took care to be no Propounder or Innovator about new Methods or
Systemes of Politicks in the point of Accusation or Testimony which is so ex|traordinarily
tender, and wherein I have found the wisest and greatest of
the Ministers of Princes, to whose Custody the depositum of their Masters
Crowns and Lives was committed, to appear undetermined as to their
measures.
And of this D' Ossat's Letter 150th, and to Villeroy in the year 1602,
hath transmitted to the World a remarkable instance, where he saith,
I have received advice from Lorrain, that an English Divine called Pitts,
having held Communication with a French Divine called St. German, a|bout
killing the King, and the said St. German having dropped some words
whereby another came to understand it, the Bishop of Toul examining it
caused the said St. German as well as the said Pitts to be put in Prison, and
by the Party accused denying the Fact, his Condition is found better than the
Accusers, who hath no way to prove what the other said to him, none else being
present: which proceeding whether 'twas deliberate or by neglect, tends to this,
that no man hence forward to whom any one hath spoken of killing the King,
will dare to reveal it to any one for fear of being put in Prison, and punished:
for that he was willing to save the life of the King and preserve the whole
Kingdom: whereas in Cases of such Consequence it ought to be free to any
man to Accuse another, not only without fearing any thing, but further with
hopes of great Recompence: having a respect never the less not to believe too
lightly nor to Condemn any Person upon the bare Affirmation of another without
good Indications and Proofs. I believe that the King advertised of this mat|ter
will at least take care of the Deliverance and Safety of him that could not
endure to hear any speak of murdering him.
I am apt to think that the horror of the Fact of such an Out-rage to
the Persons of Kings, so much astonishing the imaginations of the Loyal,
and the very Idea of it being so ghastly as to affright them from Con|templating
it, hath partly contributed to some Omissions in the Worlds
providing against it: and it hath been so incident to Writers to mention
it without thinking of its horror, that a late useful voluminous Collector
we had, began the first Edition of the first Part of his Works with a
very inauspicious Sentence, telling us of King Iames his declaring his being
so much disinclined to Popery, because it holds Regicide and other grosser
Errors: as if it were possible for any man of Sense to call such an exe|crable
outragious Treasonable practice, an Error, or to range it in the

Class of Errors: or as if even any damnable Error or Heresy either could
be more gross than that.
In the next Edition he a little mended the matter by saying, and other
gross Errors: but he afterward mended the Book to better purpose by
causing that Sentence to be quite left out.
My intended Review of this Discourse that I lately acquainted the Rea|der
with, is mentioned particularly at the end of it (where I observe the
Customariness of Authors of large Discourses bestowing on them a short
Review) and do think that the Corroborating some of the various impor|tant
Calculations therein, relating to matters Political, may perhaps be of
publick use.
I shall not trouble my self with Corroborating any thing of the Plot
which hath so much weakened the Nation, nor with strengthening any
sayings of Witnesses that have weakened the Plot.
Let about 2 or 3 Lines that I think in this large Discourse may have re|ferred
to the propping up any little matter by citing for it the Plot-Wit|nesses
in general, take their Fate to be either remembred or forgot by
others as much as they are almost by me, and but one of whom is on
the Account of Testimony so much as named, and whose name hath
been mentioned in this Preface.
Nor shall I have occasion to choque any Party (or as I may rather say
all Parties) with any thing of Controversy that may be called Religio|nary:
or matters that refer not to numbers.
But the fixing of Political Observations on numbers in some things so
great as I have attempted, is a Task very difficult for a person much Superi|or
to me in intellectual endowments, to do so clearly and satisfactorily as
the matter will bear; and is not possible to be done by any without the
Expence of that time in consulting Records and Registries and Offices of
Accounts and many particular Persons, which I hitherto could not spare,
but hope to be shortly able to do for my Readers satisfaction as well as
my own: and having so done, I shall publish a Review of this Work by
it self, making such Additions or other Alterations as to what I have
here observed, as I shall see cause.
And as I have shewed that Reverence to the Age as not to expose my
thoughts Magisterially of matters relating to Numbers, but have therein
either cited Authors of Note about the same, (that so their Credit may
vouch for the thing asserted and not mine) or have fairly my self Calcu|lated
the things, or if I have omitted either to cite Authors, or to make
Calculation when I have asserted any thing relating to Numbers, I have
still endeavoured to keep within Compass and Bounds in my reckoning,
and not to favour my assertion by exceeding them, so I shall most readi|ly
on occasion acknowledge my mistake in any point however, or from
whomsoever arising: nor can any man (I think) be tempted to do other
in a matter of this Nature, and wherein his mistake amouts not to any
thing like the making of false Money, or the designed putting it off in Ex|change,
but only to the false telling of true; and which I desire the Reader
to tell after me as often as he pleaseth, and do wish him if ever he hopes that
men would receive the belief of matters of moment upon his Authority,
that he would first satisfie them that he hath implicitly believed no man:
and for which purpose I once writ my mind by a poor plain Verse in the
Album of a German on his importuning me there to write my name
with some saying or other, viz.

Is nulli credat, credi qui vellet ab omni;
Meaning it, as to matters that may be reduced ad firmam, by Calcula|tion.
I remember not that I have cited any Authors extravagant Calculation
or Error without somewhat of a fair Remark on it, and do suppose any
one to labour under a Disease of Credulity who doth otherwise: and do
account that Cicero himself was therewith infected when as to the Error
in a Childish Report he saith so gravely in his 2d Book De divinatione,
Tages quidam dicitur in agro Tarquiniensi cum terra araretur,  sulcus al|tius
esset impressus, extitisse repente  eum affatus esse qui arabat, c.
For Ovid in his Metamorphosis to tell us this of Tages that Famous He|truvian
Sooth-sayer, was not so much to be wondered at.
Our Excellent Historian therefore of Harry the 8th, when he menti|ons
that Harry the 7th left in his Coffers a Million and 8 hundred thousand
Pounds Sterling to Harry the 8th, and such as might be thought effective|ly
quadruple to so much in this age, did but right to his own Credit by
inserting the Clause of, if we may believe Authors.
I have in p. 109 mentioned that when Queen Elizabeth came to the
Crown (which was in the year 1558) the Customs made not above
36000 l. per Annum, and which I was induced to believe partly on the
relation of some whose Ancestors were Officers of the Customs in
her Reign, and whose Papers and Accounts they now have. But I
found after the printing of that Sheet, that I had made sure of being
within the Compass of Truth and likewise Modesty as to my Estimate;
and looking into my Notes out of Cambden about it, I found that about
the year 1590 and after all her Glories of 88, her Customs were farmed
but for 14 thousand Pounds Sterling a year.
One would wonder that our great Oracle of the Law Sir E. Coke could
err so grossly by his Credulity and inadvertence as he did, when he tells
us 2. Instit. and de statuto Iudaismi, that from December 17th, An. 50.
Hen. 3. till Shrove-tide 2. Edv. 1. (which was about 7 years) the Crown had
4,20,000 l. 15s. 6d. Sterl. de exitibus Iudaeorum. And he there attempts
to prove it by Records and refers to Rot. patent. An. 3. E. 1. m. 17. 26.
Middleton reddit Computa.
But at the rate of Silver being now thrice in value per Ounce to what
it was then, the Crown would have had then for those 7 years from the
Iews as Money now goeth about 1,2,60,000l. and none can think that
the King would have thought a 15th gien by the Commons to have been
an adequate Reward for the expulsion of the Iews, had they been such be|neficial
Guests to him, as Coke mentioned. We may therefore naturally
as to this say, Credat Iudaeus, c. and Mr. Prynn hath in the second Part
of his Demurrer to the Iews, c. most plainly shewn Sir E. Coke's mistake
in the Record by him cited.
I hope to be able in my intended Review to give some such further in|dications
of the numbers of the People of England exceeding all the To|tals
of cautious Calculators I have referred to, as may be variously useful
to the publick, as well as perfectly satisfactory to the Curious, among
whom the Enquiring into the Totals of the Numbers of People in States
and Kingdoms and their chief Cities, is of late become as much in request
as was the enquiring before of the number and strength of their Ships of
War.

I have mentioned before how some men of great Name have published
it, that they think the People of England and Wales are but 2 Millions:
and shall here take notice that a Book lately printed Entituled Isaaci Vossii
variarum observationum liber, and Dedicated to his Majesty, doth in p. 66
represent somewhat of the Judgment of that Learned Person (and who
in various sorts of useful Learning is deservedly held not inferior to any
one in Europe) relating to the Numbers of People in Spain and France,
Italy, England, Scotland, and Ireland, Denmark, Sweeden, c. and where
the People in England, Scotland and Ireland are represented to be Two
Millions.
But had he been so fortunate as to see some of the Manuscript Discour|ses
of Sir W. P. giving an account of the People of Ireland to be about
11 hundred thousand after he had Surveyed that Kingdom as Surveyor Ge|neral,
and after he had critically perused all the Books relating to the
Chimney Money and the late Poles, and found that of the People of Ireland
who paid their Pole-Money in the year 1661, the Number was 3,60,000,
I doubt not but he would have concurred in opinion with him of the To|tal
of the Number of the People in Ireland: and I likewise believe that
if he had seen some late Estimates of the Numbers of People in Scotland,
made by inquisitive Persons born and bred in that Kingdom, he would
have been easily inclined to judge the People of Ireland and Scotland to
be at least 2 Millions.
As I think that Learned Man was much short in his Estimate of the
Numbers of People in his Majesties Realms, so I likewise think that he
was in that of the numbers of the People in France, in accounting them
to be but five Millions.
Cardinal Pool (I think) did very judiciously estimate France, to ex|ceed
us a 3d part in the number of People, as I have mentioned in this
Discourse: and the Author of The reasonable defence of the seasonable Dis|course,
answering a Romanist who asserted, that Popish Countries were as
populous as the Reformed, hath clearly enough shewn, that Englands not
being fully peopled is not to be attributed to the Reformation, but partly to
our being drained by our Plantations, c. and he saith in p. 31, If Spain
which hath Plantations be compared with us we are much more populous,
as we are also than Italy which hath none at all. 'Tis true France exceeds us
not having had that drain of Plantations till of late, and that sparingly in
respect of us; and possibly somewhat of the populousness of France may be
owing to the Reformation, as not obliging any to caelibate.
But if the Learned Author of that Reasonable Defence (who doth so
well and carefully weigh the Nations there in the Balance of his Judg|ment)
had considered what hath been by Sir William Temple remarked in
his Excellent Survey of the Constitutions and Interests of the Empire, Swe|den,
Denmark, Spain, Holland, France, c. viz. That the common People
of France are as little considerable in the Government as the Children, so that
the Nobless and the Souldiers may in a manner be esteemed the Nation, he
would have agreed that tho France may exceed us in the Numbers of our
People, it doth not in the weight of our Numbers (as I may say) by rea|son
of the considerable weight of our Common People in the Balance of the
State: and especially if he had likewise considered what the ingenious
Author of the Book called, The power of Parliaments, mentions in p. 162,
of the English (man to man) as allowable to be a third stronger than the
French: and so I believe generally Northern Nations may be allow'd to that
proportion to exceed Southern.

And here by the way it occurring to me that the Author of the Reason|able
Defence hath in p. 24 took Notice of his Roman-Catholick Adversaries
instance of the Treaty of Munster, as upon which so many Papist and Pro|testant
Princes, Noblemen and Gentlemen have either Bishopricks, Abbies
or the like CONFIRMED to them by the Pope (and to make out what
he had said that none but the Author of The seasonable Discourse fancies the
Pope cannot be tied to an agreement as well as other Governors) and that the
Author of The Reasonable Defence hath impugned that instance by saying,
But if after all this there be no such matter, if the Pope have been so far
from confirming those Grants as to protest against them by his Legate in the
Treaty, and afterward in a particular Bull hath damned them to the Pitt of
Hell, what shall we say to the honesty and credit of the Author, c. I am
glad that by my Historical Scheme of the factum of that Peace, I have done
that which may prevent both these Authors and other Persons from being
further mistaken therein.
Most certainly (as I have shewn) the Pope did not by any Grant
CONFIRM them: but they may be truly said to have Confirmed the
Papal Religion, as far as the prevention of the Ruine of the Empire and
Emperor, and the Roman Catholick Princes of the Empire and their Sub|jects,
may be judged to have amounted to the Confirmation of that Reli|gion.
But that the Emperor and Princes and States of the Empire did as
perfectly slight Pope Innocent the 10ths Bull of the Nullity of that Treaty
cited in the Margent of the Author of The Reasonable Defence, as I have
mentioned the thing with Historical Truth, Arch-Bishop Brambal in p.
178, of his just Vindication of the Church of England speaking of that
Peace, and how thereby freedom of Religion was secured to Protestants,
and Bishopricks and other Ecclesiastical Dignities conferred on them, and
that many Lands and other Hereditaments of great value were alienated
from the Church in Perpetuity, and yet the Popes Nuntio protested against it,
and having there in his Margent referred to the aforesaid Bull of Pope In|nocent,
saith, yet the Emperor and the Princes of Germany stand to their Con|tracts,
assert the Municipal Laws and Customs of the Empire, and assume to
themselves to be the only Iudges of their own Privileges and Necessities.
And moreover Sir William Temple in his said Survey of the Constitutions and
Interests of the Empire, writ in 1671, mentioning The Domestick Interest
of the Empire to be the limited Constitution of the Imperial Power, and the
Balance of the several free Princes and States of the Empire among them|selves,
saith, that those Interests have raised no doubt since the Peace of
Munster.
While the Iesuites make the Pope infallible, and some Anti-Papists
generally make him a meer natural Agent. that must always Act Ad ex|tremum
virium, I fear not to take a middle way, and to suppose him to be a
rational Animal, and one that knows when the Papacy is not to exert its
former Principles against the Power of Kings and lives of Hereticks,
and for this reason, namely, Quia deerant vires, and one who will not
do it for the Future in all places, Quia deerunt vires.
He is not to learn the reasonableness of that Gloss in his Canon Law,
that Canes propter pacem tolerantur in ecclesi, and especially when the He|retical
Dogs are there the most numerous, nor needed he or the Popish
or Protestant Princes of the Empire to have been minded of the Dutch
Proverb so well known there, viz. Veel Honden Zyn de' haez dot, i. e.
Many Dogs are the Hares death, and that the old sport of hunting down
Hereticks with Crusado's was hardly practicable when both Popish as well

as Protestant Princes were weary of it, and that therefore according to the
saying, Difficile est ire venatum invitis Canibus.
Nor was either the Pope or the Popish Princes of Germany to be taught
that if ever there was to be that wild thing of a Crusado against Hereticks
again, better use might be made of them then by killing them: and that it
would turn to better Account to deal with them as Mathew Paris tells us
on the year 1250 (the time about which Crusado's were most in fashion, and
when Popes that had a mind to ravish the Regal Rights of Princes would
take an opportunity to do it by sending them on Fools Errands to the Holy
Land) that the Pope dealt with the many Pilgrims who were Cruce signa|ti
in an Adventure for that Land, namely, that he very fairly sold those
crossed Pilgrims for ready Money, as the Iews did their Doves and
their Sheep in the Temple. And if the 100,000 Hereticks that I men|tioned
out of Bellarmine as slain by one Crusado had been sold but for
20 l. Sterling each, a fond might have been thereby provided for the in|commoding
the Turk very much more than by the taking from him the
Holy Land.
But the Pope and those Popish Princes are sufficiently sensible of their
want of Power for any such Nonsensical Outrage: and I wish that our
English Owners of the Doctrine of Resistance, and who with Bellarmine
have agreed in that being the Cause of the Primitive Christians not at|tempting
to shake the Empire, namely, because they had not strength to do
it, were but as sensible as the Papacy is of their wanting strength to do it
in England.
No marvel therefore that the Iupiter Capitolinus in his Bull of Nullity
did not discharge the old Artillery of the Lightning and Thunder of
Anathemas, and the greater Excommunications against the Emperor and Ro|man-Catholick
Crown'd Heads and Princes concerned in the Munster Peace,
as I have shewn, nor according to the Expression in the Reasonable Defence,
damned them to the Pitt of Hell for it. No; both the World and the
Papacy were so Metamorphosed, and their old fashions so far passed away,
that those Popish Crown'd Heads found that there was in this Bull only
what partly resembled that which Ovid tells us of in his Metamorphosis,
viz.
Est aliud levius sulmen, cui dextra Cyclopum
Saevitiae flammaeque minus, minus addidit irae,
Tela secunda vocant superi, c.
But as I just now expressed my wishes that some of our English Own|ers
of the Doctrine of Resistance, were as sensible of their wanting strength
to subvert the Rights of the Monarchy in England, as the Pope was of
his wanting it to break the Measures of the Crown'd Heads relating to
the Munster Peace, I have in this Discourse expressed not only my hopes but
belief that nature it self which is thus always Acting to the extremity of
its Power, will overpower the Arts by which they have been seduced to
Principles for endeavouring it: and will render the Principles of many of
our Protestant Recusants coincident with those of the Primitive Christians,
instead of those of the Jesuites: and that this Storm which the World
hath brought on the Irreligionary part of their Principles as well as of
the Iesuites (both of which have brought so many dismal Storms on the
World) will make them come to an Avarage, and to submit to the casting
many of their Principles over-board as well as the Iesuites have been obli|ged
so to do by the Pope, as Master of the Vessel commanding the same.

And as in a Storm the very Victuals of the Mariners are often accord|ing
to the Maritime Law cast into the Sea to lighten the Vessel, it may
resemblingly be expected that many of our Dissenting Religionaries will
now part with some of those Principles that have in their Religion-Trade
afforded them a Subsistance; and that when they shall consider how this
present Pope, notwithstanding the Privilege of a Master of a Ship, by
which he may refuse to begin the Iactus by throwing out first his own
Wares and Goods, did about a year before he threw out the Lumber of
the Iesuites and Casuists, throw over-board a vast Treasure of Papal In|dulgences,
and by which the Ship of the Papacy was formerly victual|led.
It was by the Popes Decree of the 7th of March 1678, that a Multitude
of Indulgences was suppressed; and the Names of 14 Famous Popes are there
mentioned as having granted some thereof: and great numbers of others
are by him quashed without mentioning the Popes by whom granted: and
there was a particular Clause in the Decree that did shake the whole Body
of Indulgences. And tho the Virgin Mary hath been by many of the Vulgus
of Papists oftner pray'd to in Storms than the Trinity, and a printed Devo|tional
Office called, The Office of the immaculate Conception of the most holy
Virgin our Lady approved by the Sovereign Pontiff Paul the 5th, had been
much in vogue in the Papal World, yet the Pope by his Decree of February
the 17th, 78. damned that Office and (as I may say) threw it over board.
And of this the Author of Iulian the Apostate might have took notice if he
had pleased, when in his Comparison of Popery and Paganism he instanced
in the transprosing of part of the Psalms to the Virgin Mary, after the mode
of this Office that had been suppressed about 4 years before.
The old stubbornness of Popes against the making any Reformation of
Abuses and Errors in their Church hath been commonly observed: but I
believe that considering the great Figure England makes in the World, it
may not be unlikely that the brisk Spirit of Opposition against Popery
that had displayed it self in England for about 8 years before the Plot-Epo|che,
and the sharp and learned Books that were in that Conjuncture print|ed
here against the Abuses of the Church of Rome, might much contribute
to the laudable Proceedings of this Pope in those Decrees I have mention|ed.
And therefore when Nature had thus enforced the Papal Chair in so
great a Measure upon Recantation, and a great deal of pretended infal|libity
was thrown over-board, (and that even relating to some Principles
that might be called Religionary) it may reasonably be thought that the
same operation of Nature will produce among our little Protestant Recu|sants
a tacit renuntiation of the Irreligionary part of those very Princi|ples,
that both the World and themselves must needs see they have tran|scribed
from Popery.
The Complication of the Principles of Irreligion that hath joyned the
Iesuites Popery with that of our former Presbyterians Popery, hath long
been as visible as the great Isthmus (I spake of) that joyns the Mexican
and the Peruan parts of the new World: and as I being to explain as in a
Dictionary what I meant by Popery, I would not expose my self to the
Critical Religionary Controvertists by nicely defining Popery, (the Obser|vation
being no less than a Rule in the Civil Law, that omnis definitio in
jure Civili periculosa est, parum est enim ut non subverti possit) but gave the
Description of my sense of it as before in this Preface, so if I were to give
a Description of our Scotch Presbytery as Covenanted to be here introdu|ced,
I would take the said Description of Popery and only mutatis mu|tandis,

say that by Presbytery I mean the power of our Presbyters in impo|sing
Creeds and Doctrines and Rules of Divine Worship on men, and the Presby|ters
jurisdiction interloping in that of our Princes and their Laws, and the
doing this by the Charter of Jus Divinum and as they are Christs pretended
Vicars, and do account that its intended Arbitrariness here in England
justly appeared as terrible as that of Popery, and that our Consciences be|ing
enslaved to a Foreign Bishop is not more inglorious than their being so
to our fellow Subjects, and that a blush being divided among ten thousand
Ecclesiasticks after they had out-raged our Laws and our Consciences,
would have here been no more seen by us than one at Rome on occasion of
any Popes there blushing after they had so done.
I have observed in this Discourse how that part of Presbytery that
may (tho erroneous) be called Religionary as practised in some Foreign
Churches, hath here decayed and must so naturally more and more: and
was glad to hear, That since the putting the Laws in Execution against
Protestant Recusants, those of them who were called Presbyterians have,
on recollection of thought, and after Conference had with our Divines for|born
their former Schismatical Separation from our Churches, and that
particularly in our Metropolis they have in all things been ameinable to the
Doctrine and Discipline of our Church, except as to the submitting to
have their Children baptized with the use of the Sign of the Cross there,
and their Superstition in not complying with which will I hope not be
long lifed.
The gradual encrease of the Christenings in some Parishes in the Country
that I have seen Accounts of, (and in which places the Dissenters former|ly
were very numerous) hath been to a far greater Proportion than the
gradual Encrease by me remarked as to London, and within the same
years. And a Learned Divine who is Minister of a Parish not far
from London hath acquainted me, That the number of Communicants be|ing
there about the beginning of those years but a 100, hath since arisen
to 400: and I believe that generally the numbers of Conformists may
have much encreased in the Country beyond the proportion of their En|crease
in the City, and may probably do so for some years.
Tho there are several Merchants and rich Traders in our Metropolis
who are Dissenters, yet I have observed, that the gross of their numbers
consists there of ordinary Retail-traders: and as these have been naturally
Sufferers there by the Cities so much removing Westward, and by the
Retail-trade being so much gone to the other end of the Town (and
are likely so to be more and more) so it hath been and will be natural to
them to be more and more querulous: according to the saying of, Omne
invalidum est Querulum.
And in this Case it will be natural to them both to support their de|caying
Trade by Religionary Combinations, and perhaps to fancy Reli|gion
it self breaking together with their Bankrupsy, and both for the Con|soling
one another as Socii doloris, and likewise relieving one another
thereby, to endeavour to keep Heterodox Religionary Societies as long
and as much as they can.
But Necessity, the known Mother of Industry, must naturally in time
cure them of their Poverty and Temptation to Heterodoxy thereby.
Our Quakers are by many thought to be a kind of a Roma subterranea,
but whether justly or no, I enquire not: nor shall I give my opinion in it
till the Principles of their Light within shall be exposed to that without;
many of which Principles have hitherto been by them kept as hid from

the World as were the Subterraneous Lights preserved in the Roman Monu|ments,
and as to which Principles they are perhaps conscious that when
they shall be exposed to the Air and Light of the Sun, they will be as na|turally
extinguished as those Monumental Lights were when occasional|ly
brought into the open Air.
But one of their known Tenets being the unlawfulness of Oaths, I account
they have an advantage thereby beyond the Presbyterians or Independents
in their Claim to Indulgence, by demanding it in a Doctrinal point where|in
there is Dgnus vindice nodus, by reason of some words in the 5th of
St. Matthew and 5th of St. Iames seeming prim facie very emphatically
and vehemently to forbid all manner of swearing, as the Commentators ge|nerally
observe.
And in this point they are entituled to a very true and great Compassi|on
because, of the very false Comments so many true Protestant would-be's
Actions have made on their great promissory Oaths beforementioned:
and for that they have not out-raged their Natural Allegiance by Rebel|lions,
as many other Dissenters have done. If therefore to those Yea and
Nay Men, the King should grant such a Charter as the men of Rippon had
from King Athelstan, namely, Quod homines sui Ripponienses sint credendi
per suum yea  per suum nay, in omnibus querelis  curiis licet tangentibus
Freed-mortel, c. I should not grudge it them.
And to speak frankly, I know not but this their sullen Principle may be
subservient to some great Birth of Nature, that may happen perhaps with|in
an Age or two, when shame may in the more populous World have so
far exterminated Fraud and Cozenage and the danger of Perjury, as that
the manner of our Oaths Assertory before Tribunals may grow obsolete:
a thing I account not altogether improbable, since I my self observed that
in a Case that happened before some of the greatest Peers of the Realm,
Authorised to give an Oath as being the Lords Commissioners of Prizes in
the first Dutch War, it appeared that there was somewhat in Nature
that had greater weight than an Oath among some men, namely, Reputa|tion:
for many Merchants being present at a sitting of ther Lordships, and
one of them claiming a Ship and lading before them as wholly belonging
to Hamburgers, and shewing himself ready to swear the same before their
Lordships, one of the Lords asking him if he would on his Reputation de|clare
that no Subject of the States of Holland was as Proprietor therein con|cerned,
he refused to do it.
But before this Golden Age of Morality may come, and the bending
Leaden-rule of Oaths hath been laid aside, I expect that the Names of se|veral
of our Religionary Parties will be forgotten, and be as insignificant
as the word Lollards and Lollardies, and to suppress which every High
Sheriff is still bound to by his Oath, and who perhaps may think that
the Lollards were Papists or some Heterodox People or other.
And therefore were I Master of never so much leisure I would bestow
no part of it on the writing against those Religionary Errors that have
been so often confuted, and especially when I see the Circumvallations of
Nature so carefully wrought in its Siege against them, as that it cannot
miscarry; and no man having fixed his Judgment of Natures Course,
need Spur it on, and according to the Words of the Great Prophet, He
that blieveth shall not make haste.
Notwithstanding the severity of all our old Laws against Popish Recu|sants,
it hath been for the honour of our Rformation, that the Govern|ment
hath notified it in the times of Queen Elizabeth and Kng Iames,

that no Roman-Catholick here suffered death for his Religion, and notwith|standing
all the Penal Laws against Protestant Recusants and Recusancy,
our pious Princes have without any general Relaxation or Suspension of
those Laws, shewn signal favours and indulgences to many particular
Persons who appeared to the Eye of the State to be really Conscientious
and to hold no Principles that would create disturbance to it.
And as I have mentioned that Mr. Cotton was particularly indulged, so I
might likewise Assign many other instances of this Nature, and particu|larly
of the known Letter of Edward the 6th to Cranmer to omit some
Rites in the Consecration of Bishop Hooper, and of some Indulgences in
Queen Elizabeth's and King Iames his time, and others in King Chales
the First's, in favour of particular Protestant as well as Popish Recusants.
And to this purpose the History of the Life of Mr. Hildersham, one of the
most Eminent Divines that Puritanism had bred, mentions that on the ac|count
of points relating to Non-Conformity, he was very frequently suspended
ob officio  beneficio, and very frequently restored to the same: and the
same thing appears in the life of Mr. Dod an Antesignanus among them:
and both these Divines in their printed Writings asserted the Princi|ples
of their Loyalty and impugned the Doctrine of Resistance, as like|wise
some others of the Puritan Divines did, and were therefore particu|larly
indulged. And Mr. Prynn shewed himself extremely partial in re|flecting
on the Government as he did in his Seditious Book called, The
Popish Royal Favourite, by not taking notice of the Relaxation of the Pe|nal
Laws made in the Case of particular Loyal Puritans and Non-Confor|mists,
as well as in the Case of particular Loyal Papists.
But if the Government thought it so often necessary for its safety to re|voke
its particular Indulgences granted to Hildersham and Dod (for the
former being silenced in Iune 1590, and restored in Ianuary 1591, was
again suspended and silenced in April 1605, and after he was again resto|red
in Ianuary 1608, was again silenced in November 1611, and being
Iune 1625 restored to preaching, was in March 1630 was again silenced; and
the latter of them found the like vicissitude of favours and punishments
too tedious to be here inserted) how can the Government be now secure
in granting an Indulgence to other particular Protestant Recusants more
than only durate bene placito, or quam diu bene se gesserint, after all the
Dis-loyalty of the Principles and Practices chargeable on so many of them
since 41, and not known to have been since abhorred by them? But our
Parliaments not knowing but only suspecting so many of their owning
their former Principle of the Doctrine of Resistance (and who did there|fore
in the toleration of any Heterodox Religionaries in their own Fa|milies
restrain them to a number only of four other Persons to be
present) seemed with the mixture both of tenderness to the Consciences
of those Religionaries, and likewise to the publick Peace, to draw the Copy
of that Modus of their limited Toleration, in some sort after the great
Original of the old Decree at Rome against the Bacchanals, and by which
it was or dered that they should not as before be observed at Rome or
in Italy: but that Si quis tale sacrum solenne ac ncessarium duceret, nec sine
Religione ac piaculo se id omittere posse, apud Praetorem urbanum profitere|tur,
praetor senatum consleret: se ei permissum esset, cum in senatu centum
nn minus essent, ita id sacrum fieret, dum ne plus quinque sacrificio inter|essent.
But most certainly whatever Complaisance with the Consciences of any
pretending Religionaries that Parliament intended, had they had any Pro|spect

of four Persons being present any where that held any Principles de|structive
of Monarchy, and that inclined them to sacrifice our Princes and
Laws as formerly, they would have accounted those four too many to be
tolerated. And the dreadful Out-rage the Government conflicted with,
when Venner and the other few Fift-Monarchy men came out of the Tiring
house of a private Religionary Meeting in Coleman-street, to Act the part of
Furies as they did in our Mtropolis (and that beyond the wildness of any
mad Bacchanal) may well be an instance of Caution against many of a Party
whose Principles are not known, being trusted together with them|selves.
Yet after all this, as once in a little Nominal Parliament we had in the
the time of the Vsurpation, it was ordained, That all Persons that could
speak should speak the enjoyned words of Matrimony, and that all that had
hands should there joyn hands, so I believe that in any future Conjuncture,
particular Persons, who by the Loyalty of their Principles and Practi|ces,
and by their being ready to attend our Divines for instruction, can
make it appear, that they have Consciences, will have no cause to complain
of their being not free.
But by an Accident of Moment that hath offered it self to the conside|ration
of our Protestant Recusants, since the Epoche of Plots and Rumours
of Plots, I doubt not but they will find an imminent necessity to make it
demonstrable to the World, that they own no Principles destructive of
it: and that particularly the easie access that Witnesses have found to
Credibility on their swearing Plots against Iesuitick Popish Recusants, by
the Precipice of the Principles on which they stood being so conspicuous
to the World (and from whence the very breath of their Adversaries, of
how mean and despicable parts and fortunes soever, hath served to throw
them down headlong into ruine so easily) will be an effectual Document to
all Recusants who would prevent the danger from Plot-Witnesses, that the
very next thing to be done by them is their bearing their Testimony against
Principles of Dis-loyalty.
The late Bishop of Winchester (to the Character of whose Loyalty and
Learning Christendom is no stranger) having his thoughts on the Wing,
and ready to take their Flight to that Region of Bliss where none are ad|mitted
but Souls that part hence with a noble disposition to Charity for
all Humane kind, thought fit in his Prospect of that World and in the
great Interval of his Preparation for it, to send to the Press his Book called
His Vindication, c. printed in 1683, and in the Conclusion of it to trans|mit
his opinion to the Age and Posterity that ever since the Reformation,
there have been two Plots carried on by Papists and Dissenters, and that
the same would long continue.
He had there mentioned Mr. Baxters justifying the late War, and quoted
him for saying, that as he durst not repent of what he had done in the afore|said
War, so he could not forbear the doing of the same if it were to do again
in the same state of things. 'Tis true indeed (saith the Bishop) he tells
us in the same place That if he were convinced he had sinned in what he had
done, he would as willingly make a publick Recantation as he would eat and
drink when he is hungry and thirsty. But neither he nor any of the Non-Conformists
that I have heard of, hath as yet made any such publick Recan|tation,
and therefore we may rationally and charitably enough conclude, That
they are still of the same Iudgment they were then, and consequently that their
Practice will be the same it was then when any opportunity invites them
to it, c. And then proceeds to say, For mine own part I must confess as

I always have been, so I am still of opinin that ever since the Reformation
there have been and are two Plots, carrying on sometimes more covertly, and
sometimes more secretly, the one by those that call themselves the only true
Catholicks, the other by those that call themselves the only true Protestants,
and both of them against the Government as it is Established by Law both
in Church and State: and as there always hath been, so there will be Plot|ting
by both those Parties until both of them be utterly suppressed: for as
for making of Peace with either of them, I take it by reason of the perverse|ness
of the one, and peevishness of the other, and the Pride of both, a thing
not to be hoped for.
How much my poor Measures of Futurity do differ from his Lord|ships,
in the Case of our Popish and Protestant Recusants, the Current
of my Discourse shews: and am sorry that he, having used this harsh
sounding word of Plots, described not his Idea of the particulars there|of
relating to the time to come, and that he innodated in this his
Censure (as it were) the Body of the two Religionary Parties, without
any exception of the Loyal in both.
But I have observed it in a printed Letter of this Reverend Prelate
to the Earl of Anglesy, of the Date of Iuly the 4th, 1672. where having
spoke of the keeping out of Popery now it seems to be flowing in upon us (as
his words are) that he saith, You know what I was for in the late Sessions of
Parliament, I mean (not a Comprehension) but a Coalition or Incorporation
of the Presbyterian Party into the Church as it is by Law Established; and
I am still of the same opinion, that it is the one only effectual expedient to
hinder the Growth of Popery and to secure both Parties: and I am very con|fident
that there are no Presbyterians in the World (the Scotch only except|ed)
that would not conform to all that is required by our Church, especially
in such a Conjuncture of time as this is.
My Scope by quoting this Letter is to shew that about 10 years ago,
the Bishop was not of opinion that Nature had condemned the Presbyte|rians
to eternal Plotting against the State, but that a Coalition between
that Party here and our Church, would then naturally happen: and as
to which I have shewn how far he was fortunate in that his Conjecture,
by the late great advance of those called Presbyterians toward Conformity,
and that therefore his Opinion varying in 83 from what it was in 72, as
to the Presbyterians, it might (had he lived longer to have writ again)
vary perhaps as to the Papists being Plotters with a Continuando, and he
might have recanted that opinion as much as he would have had Mr. Bax|ter
recanted his. And I would from that his Letter shew, that we have
the less reason to be mortified with the fear of the continuance of these
2 Plots, or to be tempted to uncharitable thoughts of the whole Body of
the Papists upon this Bishops opinion, as delivered in what I have cited
out of his Vindication, because one expression of it includes so much of
Humane Frailty and Error, viz. his Lordships saying, That he was ALWAYS
of opinion, that since the Reformation these two Plots were and would be, till
both the Parties were utterly disabled and suppressed; for when he writ
the said Letter, his Opinion appeared otherwise.
And there is another use I would make of this Pious and Learned Prelates
having given such an Alarm to the World concerning the Plots of these He|terodox
Religionaries in future time, and of his having made them as to
Disloyalty to be in a manner damnati antequam nati, and that is this: name|ly,
That the only substantial thing that could give weight to this Censure
of these two Parties being their Principles, and that the great allowance

of this Bishops Opinion as Oracular by so many, being likely to throw so
much lasting Odium on the Principles of Popish and Protestant Recusants
as Hostile to Church and State (whereby any disloyal Practices charged
on them by their Adversaries, tho perhaps very unjustly, will naturally
be the sooner and more easily believed, as I before hinted) it may
hence appear necessary for men to go, or run, and even fly from Princi|ples
of Disloyalty as soon, and as fast, and as far as they can.
But as I have here observed it to be the Interest of our Heterodox Reli|gionaries
to disclaim all Principles that I called Convulsive of Civil Society,
and the Concern of every Country to have those Principles notified (and as
fairly and particularly delineated and described as are the Beds of Sands and
shoaly places and rocky Bars of its Harbours and Sea-Coasts by Hydrogra|phers)
so I shall likewise observe that the sharp Execution of any of the Pe|nal
Laws hath not to the Factious among the Protestant Recusants appear'd
so afflictive as the publication of the Principles and printed Sayings of their
Pastors since 41, and the which seemed to be like the Doom of the Priests
in Malachy, namely, to have the Dung of their Solemn Feasts spread in
their Faces: nor could they call such usage of their Tenets, any Tryal of
cruel mocking, nor the Publishers any of The Mockers that should
be in the last times, since their very Sayings and Tenets have been plainly
and briefly published in their Authors own words and without Additta|ments.
As to the Papal Tenet in the Canon Law, dilated on in the following Dis|course,
I have there in p. 181. sufficiently shewed my Aversion to contribute
any grief or trouble to Loyal Papists by the notifying the same in the hot
time of the late Fermentation, and while some factious Anti-Papists were
so busy in senseless Narratives to load a great Body of them with the guilt
of its Practice; and when I had any inclination to shew my self unchri|stianly
or ungenerously disposed, as to the Persons or Religion of Roman
Catholicks, I might with the expence of an hour or two's time have easily
gratified such a corrupt Humour, by descanting on this Tenet, among
the Pamphleteers and Sheet-Authors whose feet were accounted beautiful
by the Mobile, for any dirt their hands threw at the Papists, before the
Epoche of the Declaration, after the Oxford Parliament. And after the
restoring of the English Genius, or as I may say, of the English under|standing
to it self, that thereby happened, I account that the Notifica|tion
of any Tenet chargeable on the Papacy or Presbytery referring to the
Measures of Loyalty, or preservation of the Rights of Civil Society,
could bring no damage in the least to any Recusants Person whatever it
might to his Erroneous Principle. And I having accounted it a kind of
nauseous superfluity to confute at large any one of the old Religionary
Controversies between our Church and that of Rome, was willing thus
to reserve the discussion of this Irreligionary Tenet (how proper soever
to be known) till some healing Conjuncture of time; and when I might
hope by discussing the same and thereby effectually satisfying any Consi|derate
Excluders, that I was no Papist, to bespeak their Approach with
more Candour to my great Casuistical point discussed.
I have sufficiently shewn in this Preface how much it imports our Se|curity
and Loyalty, to have the Fantome of the Iudicial Law exorcised
out of mens understandings, and am ashamed to think that Christians do
yet no more know the certain time of the Burial of that Body of Moses's
Laws, than the Iews do the place where his deceased natural Body was
laid. I know that some of the old Schoolmen have told us that that Law

was given only to the Iews: but when so many Popish Vniversities and
Casuists, told our Harry the 8th, That his Marriage was against the Law of
God, the World wanted teaching in this point: and the Tutelar Angels
even of Protestant Countries are still in effect put to it to contend with
the Devil about the Body of Moses his Law: and if any one hath a desire
to see the dreadful impressions that that Law hath so lately made abroad
in the World and here in England, and that have much deaced our Loy|alty
and Religion, I shall refer him to Dr. Hicks his printed Sermon called
Peculium Dei, where he hath given us very Learned Remarks, That many
unsound Iudaising Christians have still dreamed that the Mosaic Code was
yet in force, and that Carolostadius and Castellio about the time of the
Reformation asserted the Doctrine of the validity and indispensable Obli|gation
of the leges forenses of the Jews: and that many, tho they did not
assert the validity of the whole Mosaic Code, have yet asserted the in|dispensable
obligation of some particular Laws in it, to the great scandal of the
Protestant name, and particularly that against Idolatrous Persons and Places the
Mosaic Laws are still in force: and that for want of distinguishing in the De|calogue
and the Laws which follow after it, many men have run into many
gross unfortunate Errors; and he hath there referred to the Ancient and Mo|dern
Sabbatarians, the Writers against Vsury, the Modern Iconoclasts, the
strict Divine Right of Tithes, and Tithes of Tithes, or Tenths to the Pope
as the Christians high Priest, and to the Asserors of the unlawfulness of
the Supreme Magistrates pardoning Murder which God made unpardonable
among the Jews: and to Baronius and Bellarmine arguing thence for the
Popes Supremacy: and to Pope Adrian the 6th moving the Princes of Ger|many,
to cut of Luther and his followers, because God cast Corah and his
Company down to Hell, and commanded that those who would not obey the
Priest should be put to death: and to the Promoters and Abettors of the So|lemn
League and Covenant, which some have equalled to the Covenant of
Grace, and were wont to express themselves about it in the Text and Phrases
of the old Testament, which concerned the making, breaking or renewing of
that Political Covenant which God made with the People, and afterwards
with his Vice-Roys the Kings of the Jews: and to the specious popular Argu|ments
used by the former and later Rebels in Great Brttain, for Deposing
and Murthering Kings, and to the Speech delivered at a Conference concern|ing
the Power of Parliament which is nothing but Doleman alis Parson's
Title to the Crown transprosed.
And under this head we might refer to the Covenant mention'd among the
Independent Churches.
Mr. Burroughs one of the best of our late Independents, quoting Deut.
13. 6. If thy Brother, the Son of thy Mother, c. Chap. 5. of his Irenicum
saith, Let not any put of this Scripture saying, this is in the Old Testament,
for we find the same thing, almost the same words used in a Prophecy of the
times of the Gospel. Zech. 13. 3. He saith indeed that by those words in
Deut. the meaning is not that his Father or Mother should presently run a
Knife into him, but that they should be the means to bring him to condign pu|nishment
even the taking away his life.
Calvin likewise in giving his sense of that place of Zechary foresaw the
Odium of having any killed without going to the Iudge, and there saith,
Mult hoc durius est, propriis manibus filium interficere, quam si ad Iudicem
deferrent. But here Mr. Burroughs and Calvin have Categorically enough
asserted what the Iudges duty is in the Case, and I have said what Calvin
effected by going to the Iudge about Servetus.

Gundissalvus doth not determine the lawfulness of burning an Hereti|cal
City without going to the Iudge; and the lawfulness of Protestant
Princes judging the Persons or Cities of Idolaters to be destroyed by the
pretended Obligation of the Mosaic Law, is chargeable on the Anti- Pa|pists
I have mentioned: and I believe there are few of our Presbyterian
or Independent Enthusiasts, but who think it as lawful to burn Rome as
to roast an Egg.
But the Church of England abhorreth this flammeum  sulphureum evan|gelium:
and Dr. Hicks in the Preface to his Iovian, taking notice of the
Reasons which the Papists urge for putting Heretick, and the scotising Pres|byterians
for putting Popish Princes to death, saith thereupon, I desire
Mr. J. to tell me, Whether he thinks in his Conscience, the Bishops of the
Church of England could argue so falsly upon the Principles of the Iewish
Theocracy to the like proceedings in Christian States? And saith, if this
way of arguing be true, then the Queen (meaning Queen Elizabeth) was
bound to burn many Popish Towns in her Kingdom and smite the Inhabitants
with the Sword, c.
I have therefore thought it Essential to the advancement and preserva|tion
of Loyalty, to endeavour to have the Papal and Presbyterian Error as
to the Iewish Laws exterminated.
And the setling of this point is the more important to the Measures of
Loyalty, because the same Chapter in Deuteronomy, viz. the 13th, that hath
been the Popes Palladium for his power of firing Heretical Cities, hath
likewise been made use of by our deluded Excluders, as theirs to recur to
in a practice so scandalous to Loyalty and to the Protestant Religion,
and which hath too much appeared in the many Factious Pamphlets for the
Exclusion; and as I hinted that that Chapter of Deuteronomy was impiously
applied in a former Conjuncture, for putting the Queen of Scots to death,
so the pretended lawfulness of the Exclusion by arguing from the greater
to the less, was by the deluded generally inferred from that Chapter: and
the place I just now referred too in the Preface of Iovian, mentions, Mr.
I's arguing from Deut. 13. 6. If thy Brother, the Son of thy Mother, c.
in citing of which (saith the Dr.) it is evident on whom our Author
did reflect.
The very exposing the absurdity of the Papal power of destroying He|retical
Persons and Cities on the account of the Mosaic Law, will (I be|lieve)
as by Consent of the sober of all Parties much help to extermi|nate
the aforesaid Error, which hath cost the Papacy so dear, and natu|rally
tempted so many Calvinists to own the same Error, partly by way of
retaliation, and not altogether through defect of Judgment: and I doubt
not but if the Papacy were now to begin to claim the allowance of exerci|sing
the Jurisdiction over all Christians in the World as the High Priest
did over all proselyted to the Iewish Religion (and as appears by not
only the Inhabitants of Palestine, but others of the most remote Coun|tries,
and particularly by the Aethiopian in the Acts of the Apostles own|ing
subjection to the Iewish Priesthood) it would stop at the Conquest of
that Oecumenical Power, and Tenths of the Levites thereby, without de|manding
the Power to destroy Hereticks Towns, and to exterminate the
Persons of Hereticks by Crusado's, as other dependencies on it. But the
Papacy hath long ago passed that bloody Rubicon of the Iudicial Law,
and cannot in Honour or Politicks go back: nor will any Pope expressly
renounce the Power of compelling Princes to exterminate their Heretical
Subjects, tho yet the Fashion of the exercise of this Power be thus as I

have shewed, tacitly passed away, and as a thing necessarily impracticable
in the more populous World.
And no Iesuited Papist dares disclaim this Power in the Pope's behalf
or impugn the same; however it was a thing that the Pope could not
but foreee, that his quashing the Iesuites Power to kill men by retail,
would render the Iesuites averse from writing for his Power to kill Here|ticks
by whole-sale and by Crusado's, or for the power to fire Heretical
Cities, if there were occasion to have any such power asserted in behalf
of the Papacy, as I believe there neither is nor ever will be. But partly
according to my Conjecture of the Result of the Fermentation about the
Regale in France, I suppose that tho the Papacy will no more be
brought to disclaim its pretended Monarchy over other parts of the World
in ordine ad spiritualia, than the Dukes of Savoy will the Title of their
being Kings of Cyprus, yet it will be neither able or studious to prosecute
its Claim of such power by disordering the World as formerly.
All the personal Vertue and Probity of any Popes will never incline
them to pronounce against their Iurisdiction, however they may thereby,
and by want of strength to execute it, be kept from the old injurious am|pliating
it; and on this slippery Precipice the Papacy still remains, and
from whence through the natural Jealousie of Crown'd Heads and States
in the point of Power, it will probably fall down to its tame principium
unitatis, and its Patriarchal Figure, and in time to nothing.
But by many of the Anti-papal Sects, and such as call themselves The
only true Protestants, still owning the Obligation of the Iewish forinsec
Laws, a Necessity is by God and Nature put on the Protestants of the
Church of England to Combat such pretended Obligations by dint of Rea|son,
and thereby to support the Rights of their Princes without Condi|tion
and Reserve, and which no Jesuited Papists or Protestants either can or
will do.
Nor is it safe for other Papists to own Principles that touch the Pope's
imaginary Monarchal Power. For Power how fantastick soever, would
seem a serious thing and will endure no raillery, and the honest Father
Caron whom I have mentioned as citing 250 Popish Authors who denied the
Pope's Power to depose Princes, doth tell us, that the Pope's Nuntio and 4
Popes condemned his Doctrine, and the Inquisitors damned his Book, and his
Superiours his Soul, I mean, they very fairly excommunicated him for it.
There is another thing that may render the knowledge of this Papal
Tenet worthy of the entertaining our Curiosity, tho we are past its dan|ger;
and that is what occurs to me that I lately mentioned in a Discourse
I had with an intelligent Person of the Church of England, who saying to
me that there was one part of the barbarous Out-rage of the Gun-powder
Treason, which was very scandalous to Humane Nature, and which he
thought could not be pretendedly legitimated by any Papal Principles,
namely that part of the Out-rage, that related to the designed destru|ction
of so many Magnificent Piles of Building, and of the adjacent
City of Westminster, and the lifes of thousands of Men, Women, and
Children with one Cruel Fatal Blow, I gave him an account of the Tenet in
the Canon Law, grounded on the 13th of Deuteronomy, so fairly and fully
discussed in the following Discourse, and whereby I satisfied him about the
Principle that pretended to legitimate that part of the Out-rage: and do
assure any man that as arbitrary as the Papacy ever was, it yet was so just
as to inflict no kind of punishment on Persons or Communities that was not
in its Sanctions intimated and for what Crimes.

I have in this Discourse render'd some of our late Fift-Monarchy
men Principled for all Villany imaginable, and justly Convicted and Ex|ecuted
for a design to fire our Metropolis, and in which design they had sub|tilly
contrived to have backed their Out-rage with the terror of Armed
Forces, nothing of which appeared in the Case of the two poor French
Papists charged with the Odium of the Fact, and beyond which least of
numbers it is not in this Discourse extended: and as to those two Persons,
there being then open War between the English and French, it may be said,
that the Religion of Popery might be out of the Case of any thing done
by such as were justi hostes, as the Laws term them, however I yet think
that none concerned in the Government of that Nation, would then be
so barbarous as to design us such an Out-rage.
Moreover I have in this Discourse said, that I will not charge the al|lowance
of this Tenet on the generality of Papists either at home or abroad,
and that no un-jesuited Papist nor perhaps some sober Party in that Order
would think the worse of me for calling the Decretum of the Popes Canon
Law, by reason of its empowring him thus to burn Cities, horrendum De|cretum.
And because my knowing of this Papal Tenet, as founded on the Iudicial
Law, made me, after the beginning of this Discourse, to surmize, that more
Papists might possibly be concerned in this Out-rage than really were, and
so in my balancing the actings of some Loyal Protestant Recusants in Ire|land,
with some Dis-loyal ones of some Popish Recusants there and here,
I mentioned the Out-rage on the Metropolis as done by Papists, (i. e. by
Papists, and not by Protestants, and as Sir W. Raleigh mentioned that
Harry the 4th was murdered by the Papists, that is not by the Huguenots)
I yet thought my self bound in Christianity and Moral Justice to shew my
self so far from being in the least misled by the scandalous and incoherent
Narratives that reflected on a great body of the Papists, as concerned in
such a horrid Fact, and particularly by that whose Author in a Plot with
Booksellers had stole his Fire of London out of old printed Examination
before a Committee of Parliament, that I have shewn the ridiculousness of
the palmare argumentum of the Populace, and cryed up as so unanswerable,
to prove that very many Papists designedly fired the City, and which
Argument I have not met with exposed to contempt by any other Person,
and which had so far happened to work on the understanding of an inge|nious
man who employed himself in writing the History of England,
since the King's Restoration, that he had been likely, but for my shewing
him the Childishness of his Error, to have sent it to Posterity with a
Crown, instead of a Fools Cap on its head.
And tho I have rendred the same Tenet of firing Heretical Cities, that
is in the Pope's Canon Law founded on Deuteronomy, chargeable on our late
Presbyterians, I have exempted the Persons of such our Protestant Recu|sants,
from any guilt of an Out-rage against our Metropolis as Idolatrous:
for whatever their Principles are, there is yet another sort of Idolatry
prevalent among them as all Religionaries (and which I have referred to)
namely Covetousness, that would secure them from firing their own
Nests.
But here while I am troubling my self to do right to Papists and Pres|byterians,
I cannot without all the horror and detestation imaginable call
to mind how a vile traiterous Subject of his Majesties, who presumed to
call himself the Protestant Ioyner, was so far transported with Madness
and Fury, as to the scandal of Religion and Loyalty and common Sense,

with the guilt or that Fire to reproach his Prince, whose Reign had so
long signalized it self, with such a Father-like tenderness for all his Sub|jects.
And yet in the TRYAL of that Monster of Calumny, his slan|dering
his Prince thus with so much desperate and ridiculous Molice was
in proof. And ridicuous it may well be called: for what could be more
remote from the least shadow of possibility, than a Prince of such Emi|nent
Wisdom and known great Abilities, firing his own Chamber, and
destroying his Revenue, and vastly impoverishing the People, and there|by
weakening himself in the Flagrancy of War between England and
France, and the States of Holland? It is absolute dotage and Bedlam-madness
to imagine, that any one interested in the Government of Eng|land,
and its being a Kingdom, could be in the least a well wisher to such
an Out-rage. The very Fift-Monarchy men, who designed it, were ab|ject
Paupers, and the two French-men were no better.
But Justice found out that Shimei, who thus outragiously slandered the
Lord's Annointed: and may all such his incorrigible Enemies be cloathed
with shame; and let them see that tho Heaven doth not think fit always to
hide Princes from the scourge of the Tongues of men of Belial, yet at the same
time it sheweth some tender regard of the honour of Crown'd heads, by
abandoning the dis-loyal to reproach them with impossibilities.
It was observed by the late Bishop of Winchester in his printed Sermon
before the King on the 5th of November, p. 18. That the Doctrines among
the Dissenters that tend to Sedition and Rebellion, seem to be deri|ved
and borrowed from the Church of Rome: but his Lordship in the
same Page, having before spoke of those Doctrines, said, That if they are be|lieved
and practised they must necessarily produce Confusion among us.
Yet having a regard to the Piety and Peaceableness of some Dissenters,
and considering how long many of them had been trained up to Principles
of Loyalty before they went off from the Church of England, we may rea|sonably
have the better hopes of their not being able to believe the Do|ctrine
of Resistance and Principles convulsive of Civil Society.
But we have of late found cause to judge, that that Doctrine, and those
Principles have been believed and practised by others of them, and with
such Artifice to amuse and divert the incautelous Loyal from the apprehen|sion
thereof, as was practised by several of the Papists a little before the
Gun-powder Treason: for as at the end of the Papists supplication to the King
and the States of the Parliament in the year 1604, they undertake that as
to the Loyalty of their Priests, they shall readily take their Corporal Oaths
for continuing their true Allegiance to his Majesty or the State, or in Case
that be not thought assurance enough, that they shall give in sufficient Sureties,
one or more, who shall stand bound life for life for the performance of the said
Allegiance; and further, that if any of their number be not able to put in
such Security, that then they will all joyn in such supplication to the Pope for
recalling such Priests out of the Land (and thus by the Offer of Security at|tempted
to lull the State in a secure sleep and dream of their Loyalty)
so have many of our Protestant would-be's by the publication of their
NO PROTESTANT PLOT, so lately before their plotted Out-rage,
done what was tantamount to keep our Country from being awake to
observe the March of their Principles, till it should be surprized with the
suddenness of Sampson's Alarm when it came to be said, The true Protestants
are upon thee, I mean those who falsly call themselves so.

I know no true Son of the Church of England owning a greater propen|sion
to afford favour to Heterodox Religionaries, in points denominable
by Religion, than what my natural temper and habitual inclination
prompt me to. And tho some men are apt to have a sharper regret against
others for differing from them in judgment, than for a material injury,
I am naturally so far from such an humour, as to be more pleased with,
and to think my self better diverted by the Conversation of the Learned,
whose Sentiments differ from mine in most points Philosophical and in ma|ny
Theological, than by theirs who perfectly agree in opining with me
therein: and do fancy to my self that I have the fortune hereby for my
hmour to accord with that of the generality of men of the gayest tem|per
in the Age, how different soever their Religions are; and do sup|pose,
that if such a captios fiery Bigot as Bishop Bonner were now living,
the ingenious Maimbourg would scorn to keep him Company.
But the present State of Christendom making Loyalty a Vertue of Neces|sity
here in England, (as I have shewn in this Discourse) I would abhor
the Conversation of any Dissenter I thought Dis loyal, as of a Person not
only wicked but stupid: and on this Rock (as I may say) of Loyalty
being likely so long to continue Essential to our continuing a Nation,
have I built my Conjecture of the future happy State of England.
It is a possible thing that the serenity of its Future State may be for
some little time over-cast by Clouds of Discontent, if the Balance of
Trade should long continue to be against us, and that then forlorn Pau|pers
instead of fearing Popery would for a while fear nothing at all:
for Nescit plebs jejuna timere. But I have cited the Observator on the
Bills of Mortality for accounting not above one in 4000 to have starved;
and I having in p. 185 cited the Author of Britannia languens, for saying,
that he heard of no new improving Manufacture in England but that of Peri|wigs,
did give my Judgment, that the Ebb of our Trade hath been at
the lowest point, and that Nature will necessarily hasten its improvement:
and having observed in p. 66, that after a long Age of Luxury a contrary
humour reigns as long in the World again, I have said that of that con|trary
humour I think we now see the Tide coming in, and have assigned one
late Woollen Manufacture, by which England hath gained double as much
as for 76 years, it lately did by the Balance of Trade.
But if any one of our true Protestant Plotters should be supposed ever
to inveigle any of the poorer Mobile to fly out into tumultuous Disorder
or Commotion, any such Commotion making an Exception from my ge|neral
Rule of England's necessary future pacific State, would both cer|tainly
firmare regulam, and make the Odium of the Loyal Populace so
keen against all Principles and Doctrines of Resistance, as to exterminate
the same from our Soyl for ever, and to deter men as much from daring
to propagate the same in England, as in those two most Famous Recepta|cles
of Heterodox Religionaries, I mean Amsterdam and Constantinople.
Any one who will accord with me how necessary it was for the con|founding
of Dis-loyalty, that I should point out the fatal time when our
Trade was confounded, viz. in Ianuary 1648: and any Reader of this Dis|course
will find the obvious way mentioned, how a Child of ten years of
Age may know when the Balance of Trade is against us, and how long
it hath been so, tho not to what proportion; and so whether I have been
too sanguine in my fancy by predicting in effect that it will be for us, and
long so continue, time will shew. But if I am out in my Measures as to
that point, I am sure the Divines of the Church of England will gain Cento

per Cento thereby, as to the point of their absolute usefulness; and necessary
encouragement under a Prince of what resolution soever; and upon a
wanton supposition that they had all withdrawn themselves to the remo|test
parts of the Earth, it would be any Princes interest to invite them
back again at any rate, and that for their persisting in the preaching up of
Loyalty as they have done for several years, and thereby so much helped
to preserve us from weltring in one anothers blood.
It is excellently observed by Lucius Antistius Constans in his De jure
Ecclesiasticorum, that the CLERGY is necessary to console us with the
World to come, as to the hardships daily occurring to us in this, as well as to
direct us in our Course to that World. And if contrary to my expectation,
Heaven should think fit to punish the past Rebellions and present murmu|rings
of so many of our Land, by any future diminution of our Trade
(and when we should be enforced to work the harder for the necessary
support of our Families and of the Government) 10000 Preachers of
Loyalty will be an useful Treasure both to the Prince and People.
Fuller in his Church-History mentions, that in the year 1619, It was
complained of that the Grantees of Papists forfeitures generally favoured them
by Compositions for lght Sums. But the famous Book of The Right and Iu|risdiction
of the Prelate and the Prince, printed A. D. 1617. saith in the
Epistle Dedicatory to the English Catholicks, You have this long time suf|fered
as violent and furious a Persecution as ever the Jews did under an An|tiochus,
or the Primitive Christians did under a Nero, Domitian, Diocle|sian,
Maximinian or Julian, and yet you see no end of this fury, c.
I would ask any Loyal Roman Catholick, if a Clergy that could console such
Lachrymists and preach Loyalty to them, was not then necessary? And I
am sure he will say it was; for that the Doctrine preached by the Author
of that Book appeareth thus in the Contents of the Chapters after the end of
that Epistle, viz. Regal Power proceeds immediately from the Peoples Ele|ction
and Donation, c. By the Spiritual Power which Christ gave the Pope
in his Predecessor St. Peter, he may dispose of Temporal Things, and even of
Kingdoms for the good of the Church: and the many Republican and Sedi|tious
Assertions in that Book are such, that any Asserters thereof would
in the judgment of our Loyal Populace, be thought to merit what the
Iews or Primitive Christians suffered as aforesaid. And that no man
dares now partly so fear of the Popular displeasure and being thought ab|surd,
say, that the English Monarchy is otherwise than from God and not
from Mens Election, just as for fear of the People, the chief Priests
and Scribes and Elders durst not say that the baptism of Iohn was not
from Heaven but of men, is most eminently to be attributed to the late
Loyal Sermons made expressly of Loyalty by the Divines of the Church
of England.
But that I may draw toward an end of this long INTRODVCTION
or PREFACE (wherein yet if I have happened to acquaint any
Reader with any valuable point of Truth, it will be the same thing to him as
the payment of a Bill of Exchange in the Portico or in the House) I am ne|cessarily
to say that by the inadvertence of an Amanuensis employed in
writing somewhat of this Discourse for the Press, there happened to be
several mistakes of words and names; and one of them I shall mention
here, and not trust to its being regarded among the Errata, viz. that
whereas 'tis said in p. 39, that Creswel a Iesuite writ for King Iames his
Succession when Parsons writ against it, it should have been said that
Chricton a Iesuite then did so: and so the latter part of the Volume of

the Mystery of Iesuitism relates it: and any indifferent man would think
that Chricton writ not in earnest, and that his Book appeared not on the
Stage of the World, but only to go off it, since so necessary a Counter|poyson
to Parsons his Book, could never yet be heard of in any Li|brary.
Some little Omissions and Errors about Letters and Pointing, easily
appearing by their grossness, are not put into the Errata: and some the
Reader will find amended with the Pen.
Moreover I am to Apologize for the carelesness of the Style, and to ac|quaint
the Reader, that the Rule of any ones writing in any thing that
is called a Letter, being the way of the same Persons speaking, I do there|by
justify the freedom I have taken in not polishing any Notions, or deli|vering
them out with the care employed on curious Pictures (and that re|quire
twice or thrice sitting) and in using that colouring of words, and such
bold careless Touches as are to be used in the finishing up any piece at once,
and which the Nature of Discourse necessarily implies, and in sometimes
using significant expressions in this or the other Language for any thing,
as I do in my common Conversation with those who understand those
Languages; and by the same Rule I have exempted my self from the
trouble of that nice weighing of things as well as of words, that a Pro|fessed
History or Discourse, otherwise then in the way of a Letter, would
have required, and the same excuse may serve for the Style of this Preface.
If the Date of this Discourse had not at the writing of the first Sheet
been there inserted, a later one had been assigned it: but I thought
it not nti on the occasion thereof to have that Sheet reprinted.
I hope to be able in my Review to gratifie the Readers Curiosity with
somewhat more of satisfaction as to the Monastic Revenue, and which in
p. 92 I mentioned as not adequate to the maintenance of 50000 Regulars
by my not considering how plentifully it was supported by Oblations of
various kinds, and other ways not necessary to be here enumerated.
In p. 1. I say, I think it was St. Austin who said, Credo quia impossibile
est: and have since thought it was Tertullian. I care not who said it, as
long as I did not.
I have in p. 13 mentioned the Order of Iesuites as invented by the Pope
in the year 1540, wherein I had respect to the time of its Confirmation from
the Papacy and not of its founding by Ignatius.
There are other omissions and faults in the Press that the Reader is re|ferred
to the Errata for, without his consulting which, I am not accountable
for them.
I am farther to say that there is one thing in this Preface that I need not
apologize for, and wherein I have done an Act of common Justice, namely,
in Celebrating the Heroical Vertue and Morality of this present Pope,
that were signalized as I have mentioned.
Almighty God can make the Chair of Pestilence convey health to the
World, and can preserve any Person in it from its mortal Contagion.
But the truth is, I was the more concerned to do the Pope the right I have
done, because I observed, that after that Credit of the Popish Plot began
to die, that depended on the Credit of the Witnesses, several Persons
attempted to put new Life into it, by their renewed impotent Calumnies
cast on the Character of the Pope, and as appeared by a bound 8^o printed
in the year 1683, called The Devils Patriarch, or a full and impartial Ac|count
of the Notorious Life of this present Pope of Rome, Innocent the 11th,
c. Written by an EMINENT Pen to revive the remembrance of the

amost forgotten PLOT against the life of his Sacred Majesty and the Prote|stant
Religion.
What AVTHOR was meant by that EMINENT PEN, I
know not in the least. The Preface to the Reader concludes with the
Letters of T. O. The vain Author having throughout his Book ridicu|lously
accused the Pope of immorality and scandal, and of being a friend
to Indulgences, and of favouring the loose Principles of the Iesuites, and of
contriving the Popish Plot and carrying it on in concert with the Iesuites,
concludes by saying in p. 133. This Pope had great hopes of re-entry into
England by his hopeful Plot: hereupon Cottington's bones were brought to
be buried here, c.
It was high time then for People to be weary of the Martyrocracy when
the Plot came to be staruminated by Cottington's bones, and the pretended
immorality of so great an Example of severe Vertue as this Pope, and when
the belief of the Testimony against some men as Popish Ruffians was endea|voured
to be supported by the Childish Artifice of making a Ruffian of
the Pope himself.
But indeed long before the Edition of that trifling Book, many
things had occurred so far to shake the testimony of the Witnesses, as that
it grew generally the Concordant voice of the Populace, that on a suppo|sal
of several of the same Persons being again alive to be tryed on the Te|stimony
of the same Witnesses before the same Judges, it would not have
prejudiced a hair of the heads that were destroyed by it, and particularly
in the unfortunate Lord Stafford's Case.
I have in two or three places of this Discourse, speaking of the Papal
Hierarchy, called it Holy Church, its old known term, and by which I
meant no reflection of scorn: nor would I laugh at any Principle of Re|ligion
found among any Heterodox Religionaries that the dying groans
of the holy Iesus purchased them a liberty to profess.
But 'tis no Raillery to say, that the Artifices of any dis-loyal Popish and
Protestant Recusants, that have so long made Templum Domini, usurp on
the Lord of the Temple and his Vice Gerents, that is, Kings and Princes,
will support no Church: and that as it hath been observed of some Free
Stones, that when they are laid in a Building in that proper posture which
they had naturally in their Quarries, they grow very hard and durable
(and if that be changed, they moulder away in a short time) a long dura|tion
may likewise be predicted to the Arts and Principles of reason appli|ed
to support a Church as they lay in the Quarry of Nature, and where
the God of Nature laid them for the support of Princes and their People,
and  contr. In fine, therefore since the Principles of the Church of Eng|land
are thus laid in it as they were in that Quarry, none need fear
that they will be defaced by time, or that a lawful Prince of any Reli|gion
here will accost it otherwise than with those words of the Royal
Psalmist, viz. Peace be within thy Walls, and Prosperity within thy Pa|laces.

The Earl of Anglesy's Courage and

Of the Papists calling King James

Observed that the Kings long Parlia|ment
by the Act for the Test, did
enjoyn the Oaths of Allegiance
and Supremacy to be taken, ib.
Those Oaths lay on the Takers an Ob|ligation

ib.
Mr. Prynn's Book called Concordia
discors printed Anno 1659, to

that is unmoral or inhumane,

The Author observes that few or no
Writers of the Church of Rome
have lately thought fit by their
Pens, to assert the Inheritable
Right of Princes, without respect
to any Religionary Tenets they
may hold, p. 215.
The Author thinks that for a Prote|stant
at this time to write for the
devesting any Roman Catholick
Prince of his Property and Right
of Succession, when few or no Wri|ters
of the Church of Rome, either
do or dare for fear of offending
the Pope, employ their Pens for
the preservation of such his pro|perty
and right without respect to
to any Religionary Tenets he may
hold, is like drawing against a
naked man, ib.

more and more ashamed of the
turpitude of the former Princi|ples

there were more Colleges and Hos|pitals

The Author observes that in the
Code Lois published in the Year
1667, the Method injoyned for
the registring the Christenings and
Burials in each Parish in France,
is better contrived than that used
in London, ib.
'Tis supposed that the publishing the
Observations on the Bills of Mor|tality
about three years before in
London, might occasion the afore|said
exact registring of the Chri|stenings
and Burials in France,
and moreover the registry of the
Marriages by the Code Lois en|joyned,

Mr. Fox cited for his Observation of
many Excellent men falsly accu|sed

fear that Popery can ever
in any Course of time there gain

C2 R
DIEVETMONDROIT
HONISOITQVIMALYPENSE
royal blazon or coat of arms

Devon, Jan. 27. 1680.
My Lord,
AS to the Candour of the English Nation that was formerly so very
extraordinary, and the whiteness and sweetness of the temper of
the People of England that did adde to the representing it a Land
flowing with Milk and Honey, and to the making it like the Gal|axy
to have one brightness from thousands of fixt Stars placed so high by
Nature, that they could not suffer the least Eclipse by the shaddow of the
whole Earth; we may well since the Publishing of the horrid Affidavit of
the Infamous Person, and so many valuing themselves as the best of Men
upon their believing what was sworn by the worst, lament the temporary
decay of so great a part of the Glory of the English good Nature.
And they who knew your Lordship, (and consequently knew you to be
a steadfast approver of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England)
have reason more particularly to be sensible of what concern'd you in that
calumnious Affidavit, because the wretch presumed therein to fasten on your
Lordship the Sanbenito of a Court of Rome-Papist, and to represent you as
a favourer of Popery or the Papal Usurpations that were in Harry the 8th's
time hence exterminated, and as an endeavorer to stifle the Evidence about
the Plot notify'd by the Government for the recalling that kind of Popery.
Altho I know no Christian more tenderly inclined then your Lordship to
shew all Christian Indulgence to the Persons of Popish and Protestant Recu|sants,
and have sometimes observed your Lordship while you were wishing
that none of the New Articles of Faith in the Tridentine Creed were by any
believed, yet out of tenderness to the Persons of Devout and Loyal Papists,
with great reason to wish likewise that no Odium might come to such from
the Name of POPERY for their Profession of such Tenets as are held by the
Greek and other Churches who yearly Curse the Pope, and are so Curs'd by
him; yet none need doubt but that your Lordship will as much as any man
account it the opus diei by all due means to oppose all plotted Designs
whatsoever to retrive the Papal Power of Usurping over the Crown, or
Conscience. My Lord, there are some among us who would usurp on and
appropriate to themselves the Name and Thing of Protestancy, and would
be thought the only true Protestants, and would be Monopolists of all the
heat and light against Popery. But as I shall make bold to come in for my
share with them, so I shall yet acquaint your Lordship, that if I may in any
part of this Letter to you seem with any excess of Passion to reflect on Po|pery,

I shall before I take leave of you afford you such a Patriotly and Gen|tlemanly
reason of my warmth against it, (as I think) hath not by others
been given, nor particularly by some Pedantick Anti-Papists, who render
their Conversation nauseous by their eternal talking of nothing but Po|pery,
and while they are neglectful of all the due means to prevent its
growth.
These things being therefore premised, I shall in despite of the Affidavit,
say that I will be the last man in England who shall believe that my Lord
Privy Seal can be such a Court of Rome-Papist. I think it was St. Augustine,
who meaning well in a pang of Zeal, cry'd out on one occasion, Credo quia
impossibile est: But I shall both as to the truth of any deposing or imposing
Doctrine, and of your Lordships believing it, ground my disbelief on the
impossibility of either. When I hear men say, they look upon it as an exert|ing
of a miraculous Power Divine that the Globe of the Earth hangs in the
Air without falling, I interrupt not their thoughts of devotion, but know
that the Earth which is ballanced by its own weight, cannot fall but it
must fall into Heaven, Coelum undique sursum: And should any one tell me
of your Lordships falling into any gross erroneous doctrinal opinions, I who
have long observed the constant tendency of your understanding toward
the Center of truth, cannot apprehend any danger of your falling from it.
So likewise when I hear men impute it to the Divine Benignity that they
were not made Flies or Toads, I disturb not the Piety of their thoughts, but
know that it was not possible to make me, that is to say, endued as I am
with a Rational Soul, to have been a Fly or a Toad; which Creatures by
their very Natures are devoyd thereof. And thus tho sometimes some Pro|testant
may turn such a Papist who hath an understanding sway'd by secular
Interests and sensual Appetites; yet in the condition of that excellent manly
understanding of your Lordships, which has so absolute a Soveraignty over
all brutish inclinations, whereby you and all others whom Heaven hath fa|vour'd
with such Endowments, do as much transcend degenerate Mankind
as they do Beasts, the Errors of such Doctrines will be too gross for you to
be able to swallow.
Nor is it more possible for your Lordship to believe such Popery accepta|ble
after you have surveyed the several parts of it with your penetrating
Judgment, unwearied diligence, and the incomparable Candor worthy of a
lover of truth, and indeed worthy of your self, then it was possible for
Sir Francis Drake after he had sailed round the Earth, to believe the Opi|nions
of St. Augustine and Lactantius who deny'd its rotundity. To cele|brate
your Lordships accurate knowledge of, and constant Zeal for the Pro|testant
Religion among the happy few that have the honour of your retired
converse, were to gild Gold, and to fear the possibility of its appearing upon
any Enquiry that you are not of that Religion, is to think or fear that Gold
can be destroyed.
I have upon my occasional debates with some Persons that would make
you a Papist whether you will or no, call'd to mind some discourse I had
with you long since, concerning your Birth and Education, and thereupon
considering the closeness of your Education in the Protestant Religion, have
as much wondered at thinking how it was possible for any Principles of such
Popery to get into your Mind, as at Wild Beasts getting into Islands. While
I consider how the first thoughts of Childhood ripening into Youth, are like
the first Occupants claiming and generally keeping possession during life, I am
apt when I hear of any man's owning any Brutish or Savage Tenets, to think
of the Egg of such a Crocodile, and from what Animal it came. And he that

shall look back on your Lordships beginning, will find you descended of Noble
and Renowned Parents, both by Father and Mother, who likewise were
esteemed (as I may say) Noble Bereans for searching into the Scripture,
and thereupon owning the Protestant Faith: In a word of a whole Family
of Consessors, if Sir Iohn Perrot Lord Deputy of Ireland, your Great Grand|father,
your Grandfather Annesley an Eminent Commander at Sea, and a
principal Undertaker in Munster in the Reign of that blessed Queen Eliza|beth,
that great Statesman Francis Lord Mount Norris and Viscount of Valen|tia
a Faithful Servant to the Crown in many great Employments, and
among the rest, Principal Secretary of State, Vice-Treasurer, and Treasu|rer
at Wars in Ireland to two great Kings of Famous Memory, King Iames,
and King Charles the First, and the Family of the Phillipses of Picton Castle
in Pembrokeshire, out of which your Mother came, have their just respect
allow'd them. Your Lordship being born in Dublin received there your
Name in Baptisme at the Nomination of your Noble Sponsor Arthur Lord
Chichester, who had been Deputy of Ireland Eleven Years, and for whose
Name the Protestants of that Kingdom have still a great Veneration.
I remember you further acquainted me, that at your age of Ten Years
the Scene of your Education was removed to England, and that afterward
you spent Four Years in Magdalen-College in the University of Oxford, where
you enjoyed the Learned Conversation of Dr. Frewen then President of that
College, and since that Archbishop of York, and of Dr. Hammond, and
from whom and other Persons of that University, many have been made
acquainted that your Lordship was then an Ornament of that place, and an
Eminent Proficient in all Academical Learning, and that you there perfor|med
Exercise for your Degree with the general applause of that place. And
there where you came to that great Mart of Knowledge with so great a
stock of Natural Reason, and improved the same with so much Logick, and
conversed so many Years with the great Champions of the Church of Eng|land,
I am sure (if I may without affectation use a School Term) your Lord|ship
could have no Motus primo primus to approve any Papal imposition
upon Reason. I remember that you told me, That your Father transplan|ted
you thence to the Society of Lincolns-Inn, where with unwearied steps
your diligence it seems overcame the craggy ascent of the Study of
the Common Law of England: But where the pleasant height of it
Compensated your pain in the way, and gave you not the Landscap of one
Valley, but the Prospect of all the Land of the People of England beneath
it, fenced in with the enclosure of Property; of men, (according to the
Scripture expressions) sitting under their Vines and Fig-Trees, and none
making them afraid, where the Pastures are cloth'd with Flocks, and the
Valley covered with Corn that they shout for joy, and sing, where our Oxen
are strong to labour, and no breaking in, nor going out, and no complaining in
our streets; and of a Numerous brave Nation not capable of being enslaved
by any Wills or Passions but their own.
And sure where you learn'd the Science of this Noble Law, that is, a
Law of Liberty, your self and your Brethren in that Honourable Society
must needs eccho back that great exclamation of the Peers of England, No|lumus
Leges Angliae mutari, and not endure the servitude of the Law of the
Pope, or which is all one, his will.
Yet moreover such was my Lord Mount Norris his Zeal that you might
by all means imaginable be confirmed in your aversion against the Papal
Usurpations and Arbitrary Government, that he then sent you to Foreign
Parts, that you might see those Monsters you had here but read of, which

occasioned your travelling into France, Savoy, and many Parts of Italy.
I have been told that your Father the Lord Mount-Norris his Commands and
his Concerns both Domestick and Publick call'd you from Rome to England
toward the Year 1640. when several Parliamentary Addresses and Remon|strances
against the Papists, and encrease of their Power and Numbers had
been made. The Thunder of the Parliament had then at that time so
cleared the Air of England from the infection of Popery, that I suppose
none will think you could be then tainted with it. And the Civil Wars
of England afterwards breaking out, when both Parties appealed to God
for the decision of their Cause by the Sword, and contested with each
other in Publick Declarations, about which of them was the greater enemy
to Popery, it had not only been very impolitick, but extreamly ridiculous
for any man at that time, by being a fautor of the Papal Usurpations, to
expose himself to the fencing with two enraged Multitudes, which would
have produced the same effect as would a Iesuit's Preaching a Postilling
Sermon here against the Yearly burning of the Pope to the Populace em|ployed
in that Solemnity.
My Lord, I find my self her engulfed in writing a long Letter; and the
truth is, having a great concern for your Lordship's Honour, I am willing
to take pains to satisfie my self exactly by thus tracing your Lordship's
steps on the Stage of the World, that I may satisfie others so about your
being as averse as any one can be from supporting any Papal Power to in|vade
the rights of Conscience, or those of Princes. The Roman Historian
speaking of Nero, saith, Tyrannum hunc per quatuordecem annos passus est ter|rarum
orbis. And it may truly be said, That England formerly has endured
the Popes Tyranny, and the Artifices of its Favourers for some Ages: But the
Patience of Man has bounds, and the Propagators of such Usurpation who
had so long maintain'd a separate Soveraignty here, the which is like an Ani|mal
living within an Animal, did find that as the lesser creature is evacuated
by the greater, or destroyed therein, or doth else destroy the greater Animal,
it was so held to be in the case of such Power among us, and as no doubt it
always will be by your Lordship.
When your Travels were ended, and you had with the help of the Edu|cation
your Father gave you, saved him by your knowledge of the Lex
terroe from falling as a prey to Arbitrary Power, and thereby shewed your
self both a good Son and great Patriot, the first Scene of publick Employ|ment
wherein your Lordship appeared with Eminency, was as Governour of
Vlster by Authority under the Great Seal of England; a Charge of diffi|culty,
when the Forces from Scotland under the Command of Major Ge|neral
Munro had so long ruled absolutely there, that the English Interest
had suffered a great eclipse and diminution. How you managed Affairs
during your Government there, and how by your Councils the most perni|tious
and potent Rebel Owen Roe O Neil was opposed, and his design to
swallow up that Province and the Province of Connaught disappointed,
and the Protestant Interest in both united and encouraged, and under
your Conduct and Command the Titular Popish Archbishop of Tuam
taken, and by the seisure of his Cabinet and Papers, the Popish de|sign
upon Ireland discovered and broken, in due time I doubt not
you will more particularly inform the World. From that Service your
Lordship was upon the ill success of those Commissioners who were first
sent to the then Marquess of Ormond, employed to make the Capitulation
with the said Marquess then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, for the Surrender
of the City of Dublin, and all other Garrisons under his Command, into the

Parliaments hands for securing them from the Irish Rebels, who had invested
and streightned the same: Which happy work was effectually accomplished
by the Articles made with the said Marquess already published to the World,
And so the Protestants Interest in that Kingdom made entire, and so consider|able
that they daily gained ground of the Confederate Rebels, till at length
they were wholly subdued and vanquished. After those Articles concluded,
and reception of the said City and Garrisons, your Lordship was called back
into England, where being a Member of the House of Commons, you shewed
your self no less useful to this Kingdom; And have since in Parliament and
Council, and other great Imployments in both Kingdoms shewed your self an
Eminent Instrument both in his Majesties happy Restoration, who entirely
trusted you with the Management thereof, and in other great Affairs of State
and Government to general satisfaction, being never by those that knew you
so much as suspected for Evil Council, or want of Zeal and Faithfulness to
your King or Countrey, but every day gaining more the Love and Esteem of
Protestants and Patriots, as you had incurred the implacable hatred of the
Popish and Arbitrary Factions. I cannot here but observe, That a little be|fore
the Kings Restoration, the spirit of the people universally shewing its
resentments so strong and vehement against Lambert and his Committee of
Safety, and against all the propounders of projects of Government, that no|thing
but his Majesties return to the Throne of his Ancestors could quiet the
people, and your Lordship then as President of the Council by your great
Wisdom Contributing highly to the dispatch of many arduous and intricate
Affairs requisite to make that great Revolution without bloudshed, when things
near their Center were moving so fast, it may well be reckon'd among im|possible
things, that your Lordship should now espouse the Papal interest,
when the Vogue, the Humour, the Sense, and Reason, and Spirit of the
People are bent against it, with as keen and strong and general an antipathy
as can be imagined. And when I consider that great real power you had in
the Kingdom at that time, testify'd not so much by your signing all the great
Commissions then for Military and Civil Employments, as by both the
King, and the best and wisest of the people in the Three Kingdoms putting
themselves in your hands, and having their eyes chiefly upon you as to the
management of the Political part of that mighty concern, I cannot but
thinking of your Lordship whom thus the King and Kingdom delighted to
honour, apply to you these words in Valerius Maximus, where he speaks of
Agrippa Menenius, whom the Senate and People chose Arbitrator of their
differences, and to ompose matters between them, Quantus scilicet esse debuit
arbiter publicae salutis: Yet as great as this Man was, he could have no Fune|ral,
unless the people had by a pole given the sixth part of a penny to defray
his Funeral Charges: But your Lordships case in one particular seems harder
then his, for they who unjustly go to take away your good Name, and to
make a Papist of you, go about to bury you alive.
Had your Lordship after the King's Restoration aspired after the power of
a chief Minister, or suffered any such to be committed to you, you must have
took it with the concomitance of universal envy, that hath always in England
been fatal to such power, England having always thought such power fatal
to it. 'Tis the power it self of such a Minister that is look't on as a popular
Nusance; and tis impossible for such a great Man by raising his power only
to what he thinks a moderate height, to keep it secure and lasting. For tho
a Steeple be built with firm Stone, great Art, and but with a moderate height,
yet are there Clouds charged with Lightning and Thunder, and moving in
the Ayr sometimes not higher than the top of such a Steeple, and the Pryamid
or sharpness of such a Steeple then (as I may say) tapping or broaching such a

Cloud that comes that way, is instantly Burnt and Thundered down And
the Multitude of the Primier Ministres adorers, who are always pleasing or
troubling him with their sacrifices, do all with sudden confusion leave him
when he begins thus to fall, as if Thunder-struck from Heaven.
We find in Rushworth, that Iune the 13^t^h. 4 Caroli, it was ordered upon
the Question, That the excessive power of the Duke of Buckingham, is the cause
of the Evils and Dangers to the King and Kingdom. And we may well sup|pose,
that if a Parliament doth still as one man set themselves against a Mo|nopolist
but of one little pedling commodity, that they will look on a Chief
Minister as one that would, or in effect doth monopolize the Beams of the
Sun, I mean the Kings Eye, and as one that alone hath the Kings Ear, and
as one that is the great forestaller of the Court-market of preferments.
And happy it is for a Chief Minister, that the way of Parliamentary Impeach|ment
hath been in such antient usage, for that rids the people of the outrage
of that Minister, and that Minister of the outrage of the people. Our Stories
speak How barbarously Cruel the brutish Rabble was to Dr. Lamb, called the
Duke's Conjurer, and the reason why the people hate those they call Conju|rers
so much is, because, they think such have a power to hurt their Children
or Cattel; and the same reason makes them hate one that they look on as a
Kings Conjurer, who they think can hurt their Property, and one who on
occasion can raise up Domestick and Foraign Devils to molest them, and espe|cially
if he cannot lay those Devils when he has raised them, and who can if
he will put the People to charge, and to the danger of starving to feed his
familiar spirits. When once the people find by any mans power, the fence
of the Law begun to be broken down, they will go in at the gap, and 'tis
nothing but the Law that secures a chief Minister, and them against one another.
St. Austin therefore doth rationally in his De Civitate Dei, charge the mise|rable
condition of the Romans on the contempt and breach of their Laws; and
saith he, people were promiscuously put to death, not by Judgment of Ma|gistrates,
but by Tumults, Ne enim Legibus  ordine potestatum, sed turbis
animorum Conflictibus Nobiles ignobiles necabantur.
Your Lordship therefore when you had been a repairer of the breaches of
the Nation, and of the Law therein, and (in the Scripture expression) a resto|rer
of paths to dwell in, as easily and unconcern'd gave up the great depositm
of power the King and Kingdom entrusted you with, as ever you restored
the least to a private person, and have ever since among the Councellors of
your Prince both endeavoured to make your Country safe, by giving Coun|sel
against any Neighbour Nations being too powerful, and to make your
self secure by your not grasping more power than you saw in the hands of
each of your honourable Colleagues, as well knowing that any single Mini|ster
that shall here set up to be a Dispenser of the Soveraign Power, had need
either still wear a Coat of Male and an Iron Brest-plate, or bind the whole
Kingdom to the Peace. Your Lordship can hardly look into antient History
without meeting Examples of the People like the Leviathan playing in the
Ocean of their power, and spouting out their censures both with fury and
wantonness, when they are dooming the great. You know the Lacedemonians
did reprimand their Lycrgus because he went with his head stooping, the
Thebans accused their Paniculus for his much spitting, and the Athenians
Simonides because he spoke too loud, the Carthaginians Hannibal because he
went loose in his garments, the Romans Scipio because he did snore in his sleep,
the Vticenses Cato for his eating with both Jawes, the Syllani Iulius Caesar,
for wearing his girdle carelessly, the Romans were angry with Pompey for
scratching himself but with one finger, and likewise for wearing a garter
wrought with Silver and Gold on one leg, saying that he wore such a Diadem

about his foot as Kings do on their heads, though yet it seems the only cause
of his wearing it was to hide a Sore place there. And in these above-menti|oned
cases we are not to think that those Ancient and wise people who thought
the rest of the world barbarous, could censure those persons so barbarously for
those sensless reasons, but out of a hatred to the persons Censured, were resol|ved
to strike at the first thing they met, how innocent soever in it self, in
persons they thought they had reason to represent odious.
A late Great Man, who in a Public Speech in Parliament render'd the En|glish
tongue as having the Monopoly of the term good Nature, found that
they had not engrost the thing when they imagined that his Ministry Monopo|lized
much of the Regal power. And another eminent person, afterward a Mi|nister
to His Majesty, Suffered as a favourer of the French, at whose imprison|ment
I have heard that the Lovre rang with as much joy and triumph as if
they had carried the point in a great fight at Land or Sea; and he likewise suffer|ed
obloquy as if concern'd in the infamous murder of Sr. Edmond Godfrey,
from which he was certainly as free as from having killed Iulius Caesar:
And how far the embroider'd garter about his leg, made him like Pompey,
Envyed, I know not; But as I said 'tis a chief Ministers power the people of
England strike at, who may not be unfitly resembled to Alexanders Buce|phalus,
that would let none but Alexander ride him, nor could Alexander
himselfe do it till by holding him against the Sun he kept him from being
frighted with the sight of his Shadow. And when one Subject seems to be
the representative Shadow of the body of the whole people, the Sight of
him frights them so as to make them uneasie to be ruled, And therefore I
think his Majesty did rationally provide for the public Security when he sig|nified
His pleasure in a Speech in a late Parliament about not Ruling us by
a single Ministry.
I should not wonder if your Lordship were called a Papist if you had been
the possessor of any such power, that name being now the angriest the people
can throw at any one, as it was before the late Warres, when Archbishop
Laud who had writ so well, and so much against the Papists, fell under the
weight of that name, But really by the power of that chief Ministry he had
in the State of England after the death of the Duke of Buckingham. And at
that time the currant definitions of a Papist, and of one who enjoyed Arbi|trary
Power were the same, And the things made conveble, or Devils dan|cing
in the same Circle. And so likewise the Vouge at this time obtains among the
populace who cannot see through the hard words and things in definitions,
and if you ask them what is a Papist, they will tell you he is one that is for
Arbitrary Power, and asking them what is one that is for Arbitrary Power, they
will say a Papist. And in cases where the people do not think fit to begin
with Execution, Common Fame goes for proof against such a Minister, and
the political whispers of other Great Men who inspire them, goe for demon|strations,
and they think knocking down Arbitrary Power with Arbitrary
proof is a good baculium argumentum ad hominem, or rather a Monster of
power, for as such they look on one of the People, who is so by the head
higher then themselves. I know none to have observed the constitution and
customes of the Government of Venice better then your Lordship, and
there any one that is but Arbitrarily affected (as our term is here, Popishly
affected) is taken volly before he comes to the ground, or at furthest, at his
first rebound, and his head made a Tennis Ball before he comes to be bandi'd
among the people, I mean he is first Sumonarily dispatcht, or made away, and his
plenary process is dispatcht or made up afterward. Your Lordship hath in the
course of your travels been there in person, but my eyes have only beheld it
as a traveller in Mapps and Authors: one of whom, namely Boccaline in his

Raggnagli di Parnasse Speaking of Venice saith that the dreadful Tribunal of
the Councel of ten, and the Supream Magistracy of the State-Inquisition, could
with three ballotting balls easily bury alive any Caesar or Pompey who began to
discover himself in that well governed State. And according to the Lawes of
that Country any aspirer of the first rate so sunk by the shot of the ballotting
balls, may be said to be kill'd very fairly, though there was no more Citation in
the case then in that of the Martyrdom of Sir Edmond Godfrey, who yet according
to the principles of the Canon Law was likewise killed very fairly. I here al|lude
to the Style of the brothers of the blade, who when sworn at a Tryal a|bout
one murthered in a Duel, usually depose that he was killed very fairly,
And indeed I have by a Neighbour of mine, who is a Civilian, been shewn
it in a Civil Law Book called the Second Tome of the Common Opinions, in folio,
Book 9. p. 462. Printed at Lions, that Rebellis impun occidi possit,  tunc
demum probari  declarari quod erat rebellis: And the Canonists do as I am
informed by him all agree, that valet argumentum  crimine laesae Majestatis se
rebellionis ad heresim, and with good reason according to the Popish hy|pothesis,
for that, he that is a heretic, is a Rebell or Traytor to the Pope,
and therefore a Heretic by that Law may be destroyed before his Pro|cess
is made. But the Kings of England, like those of Israel, are merciful
Kings, and in the Laws of England, Iustice and Mercy are still saluting each
other, and with as much kindness as they can possibly shew without embra|cing
each other to death, and the meanest Commoners Life in England becomes
not a forfeit to the Law, but after a Tryal by his equals; and in this, our Law
agrees with that gentleness and equity inculcated by Grotius de Iure Belli 
Pacis, Book 3. Chap. 14. Temperamentum circa captos, . 3. where he saith,
Cato Censorius (narrante Plutarcho,) si quis servus Capital admisisse videretur, de
eo supplicium non sumebat, nisi postquam damnatus esset etiam Conservorum ju|dicio.
Quicum conferenda verba, Iob. 31. 13.
I must confess I was very much shock't with one expression used in a long
Speech by one of the managers of the House of Commons in the Trial of the
Earl of Strafford, wherein the saying That Beasts of Prey are to have no Law,
was applyed to the Earl. I am sure that Wolfs and Boars are Beasts of the
Forrest, as well as Harts and Hinds, and in the Kings Forrests where they
are in his protection, they are to have Law, and so likewise Foxes. To this
Metaphor of hunting of men in Parliament, there is an allusion in the printed
Letter of Mr. Alured in Rushworths Collections, 4^o^. Caroli, where 'tis said,
That Sir Edward Cooke in the House protested, that the Author and cause of
all their miseries was the Duke of Buckingham, which was entertain'd and
answered with a cheerful acclamation of the House, as when one good Hound re|covers
the scent, the rest come in with a full cry: So they pursued it, and every
one came on home and layed the blame where they thought the fault was. But
yet by this saying of Alured, it seems they thought they were to give him
Law; and 'tis a brutish thing to suppose that wild predatory Beasts have in
the Kings Forrests more protection, and more exemption from being arbitra|rily
hunted down, than his Liege people to whom he is sworn, have in the
whole Realm in general, and in his Courts of Justice in particular. That
time seemed not so much : But your Lordships know|ledg
in the Laws of the Land and in the Laws of Nations is so universal and
profound, that you can come to no Court in the World, but will either find
Law there or bring it: and your great knowledg of the Parliamentary
Transactions in all past Ages, cannot but secure you against any apprehen|sions
of not finding Law. For it hath been rarely seen, that a House of
Commons has gone to hunt any man down tho with the Law, that was not
a Nimrod a Mighty hunter of our Laws themselves; and never was the House

of Peers thought a Court of Rigor and Cruelty, and as the Tribunal of Cas|sius
was for its dire severity called Scopulus Reorum. In the end of the famous
Tryal of the Earl of Strafford, the House of Commons foresaw that the Lords
would acquit him, and therefore they broke up the Judicial prosecution against
him, and proceeded by Bill of Attainder, and shortly after broke in pieces on
his Grave the Rule and Standard of Treason they proceeded by, as Heralds
break their Staffs at the Funerals of Illustrious Persons, and cast them into
their Tombes. Had I been one of that Lords Judges I should have consented
that after he had been hunted so long by the Prosecution for Treason, and was
not Judicially convicted of it, he should have had the priviledg of a Hart-Royal
proclaimed, of which Manwood in his Forrest Law speaking, saith, That
if the King doth hunt a Stag he is called a Hart-Royal, and that if he doth
hunt a Hart in the Forrest, which by chacing is driven out, and the King gives
him over, as either being weary, or for that he cannot recover him, then because
such a Hart hath shewn the King pastime, and is also Cervus eximius, and that
therefore the King would have him preserved, he causeth Proclamation to be
made in the adjacent Villages, that none shall kill, hunt, hurt, or chace him, and
hinder him from his return to the Forrest, and ever after such a Hart is called
a Hart-Royal proclaimed. But I think that an eximious man impeacht in
Parliament and there acquitted, will need no Herald to proclaim his worth,
nor his deserving to be restored in integrum to the Royal Protection and Fa|vour,
when that his own works have praised him in the gates, that is, in the
Jurisdiction where they were so strictly scann'd. My Lord, if any could
prove your Lordship to be a Papist, he need not call that accumulative Trea|son
in you, nor need he go about by torturing the Law to make it confess
many Felonies to be one Treason, many Rapes to be one false coming: But
Popery in you would be plain down-right, palpable and rank Treason by ver|tue
of the Statute of 23 of Elizabeth, Ch. 1. which makes it High Treason
for any person in the Dominions of the Crown of England to be withdrawn
from the Religion then established, to the Romish Religion. That your Lord|ship
hath been bred a Protestant, and been so (as it were) ex traduce, there
needs no other evidence then the contents of this Letter, and that you have
not been withdrawn to the Romish Religion, you have declared by the Se|ries
of your actings against it, that shew your Mind beyond the power of
words: and 'tis by the help of that great Wisdom God has given you, that
our English World expects that a way may be found how to make it more
clearly appear to the eye of the Law when any others have been or are with|drawn
to the Romish Religion, a thing perhaps at present of somewhat diffi|cult
proof: For without supposing that the Pope can or will give them di|spensations
to take all Oaths and Tests that can be devised, doth not a reser|ving
some fantastic sense to themselves, make nonsense of all Oaths, and that
one word Equivocation make them proof against all other words? Doth
not that with them sanctify, or at least justify all other words they can use?
May they not on these terms safely swear there is neither God, nor Man, nor
Hell, nor Devil, that is meaning, not in a Mathematical point, or in Vtopia,
and that they saw not such a Man such a day, that is, not with the eyes of a
Whale? And have not the late dying Speeches of some of these Imposters, and
particularly Father Irelands, shewn us, that in the points of mental reserva|tion
and equivocation they persevere in the impudent owning of that which
would unhinge the World, and turn humane Society into a dissolute multi|tude?
And do we not believe many to be Papists, who we know have taken
the Oaths and Tests? Hath not a Papist some Years since writ of the law|fulness
of the taking of the Oath of Supremacy? I speak not this, my Lord,
to derogate from the Wisdom of our Ancestors that appointed these discrimi|nations,

nations, and do think that when we have used all the lawful means we can,
to know who among us are Papists as certainly as we do what is Popery, and
to keep Papists from hurting us and themselves, we ought to acquiesce in the
Results of the Providence of God. But what all those means are, tho I know
not, yet I am apt to believe that your Lordships comprehensive knowledg
of men and things, and of the true interest of the Kingdom hath qualified
you to tell your Royal Master and His Houses of Parliament: nor do I be|lieve
that the difficulty of either finding out such means and making practi|cable
things be practised will blunt, but rather whet the edg of your Industry
in this case, as being of Quintilians mind who Judged that there was Turpi|tude
in despairing of any thing that could be done. I think his words are
Turpiter desperatur quicquid fieri potest. Tis certainly the interest of the King
and Kingdom that the numbers of the Papists here, and especially of those with|drawn
from Protestancy to the Church of Rome should be known, in the
case of which Apostates, tho it be impossible without seizing on the Papers
and Archives of one certain Priest to see the Original Acts of their Recan|tation
of Protestancy, yet is it most certain and on all hands confessedly true,
that Eminent Overt-Acts of abhorrency of Protestantisme are alwayes requi|red
at the admitting one who was of that Religion into the bosome of the
Roman Catholic Church: which any one will be convinced of who reads the
Letter of Cardinal D'Ossat to Villeroy of the 20th of Octob. 1603. from Rome,
where he gives his Opinion against the Queen of England being made God|mother
at the Baptism of Madam. That Cardinal who had incomparable
skill in the Canon Law, and the knowledg of all the Customs of the Papal
See, and who had lived at Rome above 20 Years, saith in that Letter, I ac|count
it my duty to write to you freely that that cannot be done without very
great Scandal to good Catholicks, nor without the extream displeasure and offence
of the Pope. You presuppose that the Queen of England is a Catholic: but Here
we know the contrary, tho some believe that she is not of the worser sort of Here|tics,
and that she has some inclination to the Catholic Religion. And I will tell
you moreover, that tho she were in her heart of the Catholic Apostolic and Roman
Religion as much as the Pope himself, so it is that she having been bred up in
Heresie and outwardly persisting in it as she doth, she cannot according to the Ca|nons
be held for a Catholic in public acts of Religion, till she hath first both viva
voce and by writing under her hand abjured all Heresie, and made profession of the
Catholic Faith. Nor was it ever known, that in the case of any Protestants
Apostacy to the Church of Rome, any Pope ever dispensed with those Canons,
and therefore it may well hence be inferr'd, That if evidence just so much as
the Law requires as to such Apostacy be given, that no superpondium or proof
of overt-acts more then necessary ought to be expected, for that overt
Acts almost impossible to be proved, may yet necessarily be pre|sumed:
but this by the way. And therefore now further, my Lord, if fas est
ab hoste doceri be adviseable in the case, as strict Circumstances may be requi|red
in the conversion of Papists to our Church, as are in the withdrawing of
any from our Church to theirs. Indeed if I were a Member of Parliament,
and any one there should be so happy as to invent a way, and propound it
whereby the present Lay-Papists in England might let us have a Moral Cer|tainty
that they neither consented to nor concealed the late Plot, and like|wise
that they did really detest all those desperate Popish Principles that are
fundamentally destructive to the Safety of the King and Kingdom, and that
they would harbour no Priests born in the Kings Dominions, nor send any
of their Children to be bred in Forrain Seminaries; and on the contrary, that
on occasion they would discover to a Magistrate any such Priest, or one who
sent his Children to such Seminary, and likewise any one that owned any of

those Pernitious Principles that strike at the heart of the Civil Government,
and that they would presently give his Majesty an accompt of all their own
Names, Places of abode, and Numbers of their Families, and that they would
not live in nor come to the Court nor into any of our Cities or great Towns,
without leave obtain'd pursuant to the Statute of the 35^t^h^. of Elizabeth, Ch. 2.
(wherein 'tis Enacted under several Penalties, That they shall not remove
above Five miles from their dwellings, and to give in their Names to the
Constables, Headborough, and Minister, c.) and that the people might be
delivered not only from any danger by them, but any fears that might fall
on a wise man, either of their power or numbers encreasing I should joyfully
entertain such an invention; But what way of that kind is practicable, I
am altogether ignorant, But do suppose that the present Lawes, Oaths, and
Tests, ought to continue till with the Consent of His Majesty and Lords and
Commons in Parliament we are further secured.
I know that we ought to be much more vigilant over English Papists,
then over any Forrainers, for that 'tis a kind of a Rule that Angli nil modicum
in Religione possunt, and therefore that no Popish Priest who is a Subject to
England can with the public safety live here. Your Lordship hath I think
as comprehensive a knowledg of the affairs of Ireland, as any man can have,
and therefore I shall here tell you that a Gentleman of Ireland told me that
in the times of the usurpt powers 'twas in the Act of Settlement for Ireland
by the Parliament declared, that it was not their intent after almost a National
Rebellion to extirpate the whole Irish Nation, but that after an exception
of certain persons as to Life and Estate, the Act orders some Irish to be ba|nish'd
the Kingdom, and other Irish to be transplanted to some part of Ireland,
allowing them such proportion of Land and Estate there as they should have
had of their own elsewhere in Ireland if they had not been removed. What
effect that Transplantation had I know not, but I suppose it easier to remove
a handful of men from one corner of the Land to another, then 'twas to re|move
almost a Nation: And do suppose there are some Papists in England as
innocent of this late Plot, as there were some in Ireland of that Rebellion,
The Dean of Canterbury doth in his incomparable Sermon before the House of
Commons on the 5th. of November 1678 acknowledg the Piety and Charity of
several persons who lived and dyed in the Roman Communion, as Erasmus, Father
Paul, Thuanus, and many others who had in truth more goodness then the Prin|ciples
of that Religion do either incline men to or allow of. And so I think my
self bound in justice to Judge in that manner of some Papists of my acquain|tance.
Thus the Epicureans of old tho their Principle of making happiness consist
in pleasure was detestable, gained this point, that many of their Sect were
honest men: And so much Tully acknowledged to be true, but with a Salvo
to his exception against their Doctrine Speaking of Epicurus and his Followers,
L. 2. De Finibus Boni  Mali: he saith, Ac mihi quidem videtur quod ipse vir
bonus fuit,  multi Epicurei fuerunt  bodie sunt,  in amicitirs fideles,  in
omni vita constantes  graves, nec voluptate, sed officio consilia moderantes.
It seems to me that Epicurus was a good man; and many of his Sect have
been and are faithful in their friendships, and constant and serious men in
every condition of life: and managing the conduct of their lifes by duty and
not pleasure. But then saith he, hoc videtur major vis honestatis, minor voluptatis
and afterwards he saith, atque ut caeteri existimantur dicere melius quam facere,
sic hi mihi videntur melius facere quam dicere: As much as if he had said, No
thanks to their Principles, but their honest inclinations, the force of honesty
shew'd it self more Predominant in them, then that of pleasure: and as other
mens Principles are accounted better then their Practises, these mens Practises
are better then their Principles.

It is I think Gods standing Miracle in the world, (who is able to make
a divulsion between the formal and the vital Act, namely, to make fire not
burn) to keep some men from undoing themselves and Mankind by the ge|nuine
consequences of the Opinions they profess in matters of Religion: And
thus it is happy for the World, that Caliginosa nocte premit Deus nepotes dis|cursus:
And he can by an Omnipotent easiness when he pleaseth, Divert a
mans understanding from seeing any first-born consequence from his opinion,
as well as a more remote one. Moreover, the Divine Power doth in the
Government of the World interpose it self sometimes between professed Noti|ons
or Principles themselves, and mans intellectual faculties. Good men
sometimes do not believe even the existence of that and of some other divine
Attributes, where the things to be believed are to be seen by the light of
Nature; And bad men habituated to lying sometimes do at last believe the
lyes and shamms themselves made, though yet for the most part it happens
(what is perfectly worthy of the Divine Power and goodness) when men are
with Candor and purity of mind seeking after Truth, that-Heaven does so
influence their understandings, as that they are not by false lights artificial
seduced to believe any thing against the light of Nature, nor given up by
weak arguments to strong delusions. These things considered, I think that
that great Divine of our Age, the Lord Bishop of Lincoln, hath with a Noble
modesty and charity in the Title of his unanswered and unanswerable Book a|gainst
Popery, exprest the Principles of that Religion when really believed
to be pernicious.
And having said all this, I need not trouble your Lordship or my self
much further about finding a way to prevent the Papists from troubling us,
but do suppose that the Papists themselves are most concerned to labour in
such an invention. And instead of their being led by any hellish Principles
to destroy any City of Course by Sinister means, That is by burning it, they
may, if they please, in their Devotion, address to Heaven for that favour to
its old chosen People on Earth mentioned in Psalm. 107. v. 7. And he led them
forth by the right way, that they might go to a City of Habitation. I suppose,
that after so eminent a Person as the Lord High Chancellor of England in his
Speech at the Condemnation of the Lord Stafford, made that great interogati|on,
Does any man now begin to doubt how London came to be burnt? and after
the Vote of the last Parliament the last day of their Sitting in these words, viz.
Resolved, That it is the Opinion of this House, That the City of London was
burnt in the Year 1666 by the Papists, designing thereby to introduce Arbitrary
Power and Popery into this Kingdom, they will not think it strange that they
should not be permitted to live in any of our Cities again, till they have
shew'd how orderly they can live in one of their own: And therefore I think
we may without breach of Civility, or at least violation of justice, apply to
them some part of the words which I find quoted by Dr. Bramhall Lord
Bishop of Derry in his just vindication of the Church of England, out of Gers.
part. 4. Ser. de pace  unit. Graec. as the farewell Speech to the Bishop of
Rome, when the Graecian and all other Eastern Churches parted from him,
whom they acknowledged only as a Patriarch, Namely, We acknowledg your
Power, we cannot satisfie your Covetousness, live by your selves.
How it is in the case of the People of Switzerland, Papists and Protestants
living apart by themselves in several Cantons, cannot be unknown to your
Lordship: Nor that the Protestants and Papists when they there made their
League at first joyntly to maintain their Liberties against the House of Au|stria,
then agreed upon this also, That if any of the Natives living in the
Cantons of either side should change their Religion, that then they should
be permitted respectively to sell their goods and transplant themselves to the

Canton whose Religion they embraced. But I shall tell your Lordship, That
of late the Popish Canton Switz did break this agreement, and would not
suffer some of their Native Inhabitants to partake of this freedom, and did con|fiscate
the goods of some Families that changed their Religion, and at the
instigation of the Fryars and Iesuits they condemned some of them to death,
and others to the Gallyes which was the cause of a Commotion among
them.
The Gentleman of Ireland who discourst somewhat to me of the Transplan|tation
of the Irish Papists, told me, it was into the Province of Connaught,
and think into the In-land parts of that Countrey, for to have trusted them
to live in Maritine Towns there, whereby they might have let in an inva|ding
Popish or other Forrainer, were to have trusted them with the power of
the Keys of the Kingdom: And he further told me, That the transplantation
was managed with much satisfactory tenderness to those Papists, and that as
to English and Irish, it had partly the nature of a bargain that gave content
on both sides, and secured them against each other after all the mutual exas|perations
that had passed, and when 'twas fresh in the memory of both
English and Irish, that 'twas the promiscuous and scatter'd dwelling of the
English among the Irish before the Rebellion that tempted the Irish to butch|er
them, and made the English Sheep for the Slaughter; and when it was
not likewise forgot, that in former Wars the partition or distinction of the
English Pale did secure the English inhabiting within its district.
I askt the Gentleman if they were not stinted to a certain number of Priests,
and care taken that none of them should be Iesuits, and that the chief Go|vernour
of the Countrey should know their Names, and whether any Priests
Natives of that Country were allow'd them? as to which enquiries he did
not fully satisfie me: but I supposed, that since all Religions have a Priest-hood,
that somewhat of that kind was allowed them, and that since the Order of
the Iesuits was invented in the Year 1540. by the Pope as a Poysonous
Stumm to put a new fermentation into the Romish Ecclesiastical Rites and
Discipline, which were almost dead with age; and like vina vetustate eden|tula,
and quite dispirited with the Thunder of the Doctrine of Luther, and
the lightning of Learning and Knowledg then flying through the World; and
that that Order of the Iesuits was (as it were) a Court erected to begin with
execution, and to confute gainsayers by cutting their Throats, No Iesuits
were permitted to officiate among those transplanted Papists, and conside|ring
that the Priests Natives of Ireland were the known fomenters of that
Rebellion, that both English and Irish might rather consent to some Secular
Priests bred in Holland or France, being employed in the New Irish Colony,
and who had no knowledg of the Intrigues of the several Interests in that
Country, and would not by kindred or relation to any of the great Families
there perhaps be tempted into Factions.
I have heard from that Gentleman of Mr. Peter Walsh a Fryar in Ireland
and of his endeavours in the Art of Cicuration of some of the Romish Clergy 
Layety who there were Wolfes (and that without Sheeps cloathing) and re|claiming
them to Principles and Practices consistent with civil society, and
what proficiency his Disciples have made therein, I being a stranger to that
Kingdom know not; but according to that saying, bonus est quem Nero odit,
have the better opinion of him for those endeavours of his having been Crown'd
with the Popes Excommunications.
It was a noble saying, I have heard of one of the House of Peers this last
Parliament, I hate not the persons of any Papists, but I am an enemy to Popery:
In like manner I should be glad that all the Mercy were shewn them that were
not Cruelty to the Public; but they are to excuse any one that will not forget

that when they begun the last outragious Rebellion in Ireland (which no
words need or can aggravate) they enjoy'd there equal Priviledges with the
English, if not greater, the Lawyers were Irish, most of the Judges Irish,
and the Major part of the Parliament Irish, and in all disputes between
English and Irish, the Irish were sure of the Favour; and any one
would be inexcusable to this Kingdom, who forgot that King Iames's
unparalel'd kindness to his Popish Subjects in suspending the execution of Penal
Laws against them, in sparing their purses, in remitting the arrears of what
they owed Queen Elizabeth for pecuniary penalties, nay giving into their hands
what money of theirs as his due was in the Exchequer, was but the ro|logue
to their intended Tragedy on the Fifth of November. And what pro|vocations
they had to be ill wishers to the Life and Crown of the last King,
as appeared by the detection forementioned presented to His Majesty by Arch-Bishop
Laud, and a Charge given against them in Print by the Reverend
Dr. Peter Du Moulin, which he offer'd to make good; and ad quod non fuit
responsum, let any one Judg who further does look on the Parliaments Ad|dresses
in Rushworths Collections. And unless some of them had loved ingra|titude
for ingratitudes sake, they would never have enter'd into that Conspi|racy
against his now Majesty, whose Life is the delight of all Mankind but theirs:
And yet since according to that expression, that God is not the God of the
Iews only, but also of the Gentiles, so it being true, that the King is King of
the Papists as well as Protestants, King of the Irish as well as of the English,
and a common Father to them all, it may be worthy of His Royal good|ness
and a God-like thing in him to distribute to them all the Kindness that
would not undo themselves and others, as the Divine bounty dispenseth itself
to the Sinful, yet with respect to the Government of the World. And as
the love of an Indulgent Father may be measured more by the kindness he
would shew an obstinate son, (were he qualified to receive it) then by what
he doth, who tryes all methods to reclaim him, by his Will Disinherits him,
and goes down to the shades below without revoking such a Will, and yet
in his life-time with the tenderest bowels and softest language he was con|stantly
bemoaning that Sons being not a Subject fit or capable to participate
in the Estate equally with his Brethren; Thus too may the love of the Pater
Patriae, and of the Country it self be demonstrated to these our obstinate
Brethren, more by the Favour we do not afford them, then by what we do,
having often seen the truth of what Solomon saith, that the prosperity of fools
destroys them.
But, as I said before, I would be glad that the Papists themselves would
try to find out what way of security the Wisdom of His Majesty and His
great Councel may acquiesce in, so that any bitter way may not be prescribed
to them by public Authority, as perhaps this of Transplantation or some other
may seem, and that persons of innocent Tempers and Principles may not be
carryed off, with those of noxious ones, as all strong purging Phisic dispo|sesseth
the body of some good Humours as well as bad: and I therefore wish,
that they may rather satisfie His Majesty that they have transplanted into
their minds some such Principles as are to be found not only in Protestant
but Heathen Authors to incline men to be Gods and not Devils to one another,
(and those Principles growing in the Soil of Nature when transplanted into the
mind of a Christian, are much more generous and improved, like the Vines
on the Rhine transplanted into the Fortunate Islands) and whereby a Prote|stant
King may Sit securely in His Throne, and His Protestant Subjects sleep
securely in their houses, and walk securely in the Streets without fear of the
fate of Sir Edmond Godfrey and Mr. Arnold, pursuing them upon a declaratory
sentence that they are Hereticks, by a shabby Consult of a few ignorant Priests

in a blind Cabaret, without citing them to shew cause why they should not
be knock't on the head by Villains who account themselves the Popes Sheriffs,
and at the worst that happens to them his Martyrs, a fate of Proteants worse
then they suffered in the Dog-days of Queen Maryes Reign, (that Canicula
Persecutionis as Tertullian's phrase is) for then they were not murder'd, but
after a Tryal for their Lives and Liberty granted to recant at stake. Me|thinks
when they consider the Popes Decree made at Rome the second of March
1679. condemning some Opinions of the Iesuits and other Casuists, (the which
in Latin and English was printed for Richard Chiswell at the Rose and Crown
in St. Pauls Church-Yard 1679.) and see thereby that the Augean Stable of the
Casuists being so full of Filth that it could hold no more, the Pope to avoid the
scandal of the World, and danger to those Souls who by the practice of those
Opinions were not at that time sent to the place from whence there is no Re|demption,
(though yet as the excellent Author of the Preface to that de|cree
here printed judiciously observes, That the Pope treats those Opinions
very gently and mercifully, and indeed doth not declare them ill in them|selves,
or such a Nusance to souls that he could not dispence with) and when
they likewise consider that most of those Opinions if not all were Rules allow'd
by Iesuits or other Casuists for Confessors and Penitents to go by in the securing
of the great concern of Eternity till that time, and that Guymenius with the
approbation and permission of his Superiors in the year 1665. favours most
if not all of those Opinions with a colourable gloss out of Councels, Fathers,
School-men and Divines, and endeavours to throw off the Odium from the
Iesuits for them, upon the whole Roman Church, they should now be so
awaken'd as throughly to examine both those and other points in that Re|ligion,
supposing that some future Pope may declare the Souls left in the
lurch that hold some other Opinions recommended to them by their Spiri|tual
guides, without their having obtained a papal dispensation to hold
them.
My Lord, though I believe your Lordship to have ever had as keen an
Antipathy against Caballing with any Papists as good old Iacob shewed he
had against that with Simeon and Levy, of which he said, O my soul come not
thou into their secret, unto their assembly, mine honour be not thou united, yet
their necessary applications to your Lordship in your administration of the
Privy Seal and their voluntary recourse to the hospitality of your noble
and constant Table, where any one in the habit of a Gentleman is allowed
to be your Guest, giving you opportunities of discoursing sometimes with
Papists, I suppose your advice to them to consult with one another in peace
how to satisfie His Majesty, that all bloody Consults being by them aban|don'd,
he himself may enjoy the Kings peace, and we his Subjects enjoy that
Peace of the King which his very Wild Beasts in the Forrest enjoy, (as I said before)
and where any of the Inhabitants if they have lights in their Windows that
may affright the Kings Deer are lyable to punishment by the Forrest law,
and that we being delivered from the hands of our Enemies, may serve God with|out
fear in holiness and righteousness all the dayes of our Lives, and not be in
danger of being in the Kings High-way knock't on the head like Weasels or
Polecats by base Ruffians not worthy to feed the Dogs of our Flocks; I say I
suppose your Lordships advice backt with those reasons against Popery that
you alwayes carry ready told, may especially at this time when the ecce duo
gladii or two Votes of the House of Commons in the last two Parliaments can|not
be forgot by any of them, occasion their offering that to the conside|ration
of His Majesty and his great Councel, that may render the Kingdom
safe from any hostility of their Principles or Practises. Your Lordship hath
one advantage in giving advice beyond most men I know, and perhaps no

man is Master of that advantage more then your Lordship, and that is your
advice to any of Mankind, is the advice of a friend; for both by your natu|ral
temper, and a habit that can plead the prescription of sixty years for its
continuance in your Soul, and a sharpe edge of Wit and Reason to justifie
your claim to it, so it is, that you are in a constant readiness to shew your
self a friend to every Member of that great Body, wishing his happiness as
your own, extending the arm of your beneficence as far as it can reach, to
the remotest object without hurting your self by the straining it, with a pi|tying
Eye and a tender Hand, and forgiving Heart, guiding unhappy men
out of the very Labyrinths they had brought themselves into by injuring you,
accounting your mercy to be justice to Humane Nature, adorning greatness
both in your self and others with goodness, in the case of the injur'd poor
and weak making oft the great and the mighty asham'd of their oppression
by your reason (and alwayes with Language as soft as the yoke they intend|ed
was hard) when you could not make them afraid of it by your power,
and blushing your self for the degeneration of Mans Nature, when you
saw any that shame could not divert from the turpitude of injuring their
brethren of mankind, and by your compassion alleviating that burthen of
the miserable that they had sunk under but by your Fellowship in their
grief, and never dispensing either the Kings reproof or your own to offen|ders
without moderation, and respect to the frail state of Humanity, and
without that mixture of benign advice that gave the Malheurevs a plank after
the Shipwrack of their Fame, and very often running the hazard of drown|ing
your self by helping to save those that were sinking in the Favour of the
King and Court, and when their fate was such that all the rest of the herd
avoided them as a wounded Deer. In a word they that know your Lordship
know that by arguments hard to be answered and a softness of words and
Temper almost inimitable you have Proselyted several Papists out of their per|nicious
Principles, and have taught them goodness by your example, and by
your having that happy inclination that Hillel a Famous Jewish Doctor who
lived a little before our Saviours Incarnation so well advised, Namely Be of
the Disciples of Aaron, who loved Peace, and followed Peace, and who loved
Men, and brought them near to the Law.
Your Lordship by your being so well vers'd in our Statute Laws and Hi|stories
is able to acquaint them with the Justice of our Ancestors in the ma|king
of many fresh additional capital Laws (for sanguinary they ought not to
be called since just) against Papists upon the detection of several fresh horrid
Treasons,  particularly those against Queen Elizabeth and King Iames, and that
our Ancestors then having a great and violent indignation against Popery
and Papists made Laws with the dread of the Vltimum supplicium therein, and
further the anger of Man could not go. But it cannot scape your Lordships
observation that the violence of Passion not being capable of lasting long in
its highest rage how just soever and especially in the brest of an English Man
and a Protestant, those hot Statutes made only (as I may say) a hizzing like
a little fire thrown into Water, and as to their Execution went out presently.
Nor have I ever heard of any one that apostatiz'd from the Church of England
to that of Rome who was as those Statutes ordain punisht as a Traytor, merely
for so doing. And indeed since no Stratagems are to be used twice and es|pecially
such as did not succeed once, I am highly pleased that on the Discove|ry
of the late detestable Plot there was so great a calmness in the minds, so
general a smoothness in the brows of the people, such an universal Spirit
of Patience forbearance and meekness every where visible in their Faces, even
greater then that which shone in the Minds and Faces of the Londoners when
with composed looks they saw their City newly made ashes, and had smelt

the Incendiaries almost as soon as the Fire, that none can imagine but who
as eye witnesses observed; And even on the fifth of November ensuing the
Discovery of the Plot, the two excellent Preachers desired to preach before
the House of Lords, and the House of Commons on that day when both an
Old and a New Plot were staring the Nation in the Face, happen'd to be with
the Peaceable Genius of the Christian Religion and of the People in that Con|juncture
inspired in the choice of that same part of Scripture that was their
Text and contain'd the calm yet severe reproof given by the Founder of
Christianity to some of his Disciples that would have been Commission'd to
call for Fire from Heaven to consume the inhospitable Samaritans, in one of
which Sermons, namely that of the Dean of Canterbury's, 'tis for the Honour of
our Nation and Religion by him observed p. 31. of the Sermon, that after
the Treason of this day, nay at this very time since the Discovery of so bar|barous
a design, and the highest provocation in the World by the Treacherous
murder of one of His Majesties Iustices of the Peace a very good man and a most
excellent Magistrate who had been active in the Discovery of this Plot, I say af|ter
all this and notwithstanding the continued and insupportable insolence of
their carriage and behaviour, even upon this occasion, no violence, nay not so
much as any incivility that I have heard of has been offer'd to any of them.
Thus for the words of this good and learned man.
He that loves not his Brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom
he hath not seen? And the Religion that prompts them to destroy our bodies
that they see, makes them fearless in the damming of our Souls that they
have not seen, and even without giving us a minutes warning to make up
our accounts with God, and that too perhaps for extravagant lenity shew'd
to some incorrigibles among them, which was poor Godfreys case. But the
calm temper of the Protestants to them upon the Discovery of the Plot not
breathing out any Cruelty or new Severity against their Bodies or Souls shall
alwayes endear to me the Protestant Religion.
And though those two great Votes of the House of Commons may seem
severe to the Papists, yet are they warning pieces only if they please, and
not murdring ones, and like the Arrows of Ionathan to warn David and not
to hurt him; And indeed only to warn them not to kill David, and not to
hurt themselves, and in effect a reasonable request or petition of wo Parlia|ments
to them only to make much of themselves, and like the lenity that
accompanied the Divine threatning of moriendo morieris restrain'd to their
eating of one tree, so that no Flaming Swords need fence up their way from
the Tree of Life unless they please.
But though the Spirit of the people hath not on the occasion of the late
Plot shew'd its angry resentments against the persons of the Papists by any
outrage or rudeness, and though our Parliaments have not on that occasion
as those in the times of Queen Elizabeth and King Iames made the Anger of
the Statute Book to swell with many Acts of Parliament against them, they
are not to infer that therefore the anger of the people diffusive or representa|tive
is over, but rather the contrary, from its not having appeared violent.
And indeed as that heat of the body that is acquired not by an approach to a
blazing fire, but gradually by gentle exercise of the parts is most lasting
and most agreeable to its constitution, so is it with that heat of popular an|ger
that is the Result of the exercise of mens mindes and of several laboured in|tense
thoughts most durable and salutiferous to the body of the Kingdom. It
hath been observed by a Man of no Vulgar intellectual Tallents Mr. Philip
Nye (a Man indeed of great Sagacity in his Generation) as I find it in his Book
called Beams of former Light viz. We know that in near a hundred years the
Reformation gained little upon Popery and Superstition more then was gotten by

the first assault, nay it decay'd and Popery grew under it so fast as at last we
were almost returned into the same condition that we were reformed from, and this
(he sayes) may be the cause why the first Reformation prospered no better, there were
the like severe, impositions and Laws made upon occasion of difference among
the Protest ants and then advantages were taken thereby, and many put out of the
Master-Role for Nonconformity who were of greatest courage and most faithful
Resolution against Popery and Superstition the then common Enemy. The silen|cing
and ejection of Ministers in Queen Elizabeths dayes, reformation being new|ly
begun and the Enemies to it many, the friends and those that faithfully engaged
few, was looked on by the godly prudent of that age as very unseasonable, yea the
their crimes had deserved it, because of the searcity of Preachers at that time.
There is nothing more frequent in our Suffering Brethrens writings that were
then published against the Hierarchy then a bemoaning the great loss to the cause
and people of God thereby. I will mention but one, considering the season (saith
Mr. Parker) though we were worthy, yet should we least be deprived now when
Popery riseth like the swellings of Iordan, yea maketh invasion like an Armed
man, when there are wanting many on the other side in many Parishes to stand up in
the gap against it.
Doth not the Canon Law it self spare depriving for greater faults when there is
penuria sacerdotum  quando utilitas ecclesiae exigit. Thus far Mr. Nye, who whe|ther
he has assigned non causam pro caus or no, as to the Vigorous encreasing
of Popery after the Reformation, I shall not say, and shall forbear even with
the tenderest and gentlest hand to touch the sore place of the difference a|mong
Protestants till we are secured against the Rough hands of any Esaws
touching Gods Annointed. Nor shall I now debate of which perswasion a|mong
Protestants should strike Sail to the others, till we have put off the
Fire-ship that hath grappled us, but shall here say that I think one cause
why the Protestant Religion hath not since its first assaults against Popery
gained ground of it proportionably was what is necessarily incident to hu|mane
Nature, and even in the most generous, and particularly English Spirits
after a great overflowing of passion to find in themselves the lowest ebb to suc|ceed
the highest tide, and our boyling blood to be the more dispirited after|ward
by reason of its former heat, and for us instantly to fall asleep when
our spirits are taken off from the wrack that passion extended them on, and
to try to recruit our spirits again by the passion of Pitty or Shame which we
had wasted by that of Anger, like men that after one excess refresh themselves
by another. And as the great expenses of War which is the passion of Anger
raging in the body of a whole Nation, Necessarily at last end in a peace that
continues till mens plenty blow them up into War again, so doth the spending
and wasting the Treasure of our Spirits by Anger necessitate us into a quiet,
that lasts till being thereby recruited we are again capable to take Fire from
a fresh provocation and to trouble our selves and others; But as men grow
older and wiser they grow abler to moderate their passion of Anger, and
make it like Fire, not a bad Master but good Servant to themselves and the
Public, not a Fire that acts as natural agents ad extremum virium and so as
anger acts and rests in the bosom of fools (who are so far natural agents only as
not guided by reason) but as in the Breasts of the Wise, where reason rests and
makes all passions as its Messengers and Ministers, not unresembling what is said
of the most High that he makes his Ministers a flame of Fire, and so by God|like
men who love others like themselves, their passion of Anger is made like
a Guardian Angel to themselves and others: and by thus according to that
precept being angry and sinning not, the fire of Anger in the Protestants here
against Popery having long been light and restless, is at last got to its proper
Element where it doth not Levitate and where it hath no burning but only a

purifying quality, and thus the hatred of the English Protestants against Popery
may be said to be as the Scripture expression is, a perfect hatred, being now
come to its height and proper Element, which perfect Hatred to Popery,
may always consist with a perfect love to Papists, and cinge not a hair of their
heads more then a Lambent Fire.
My Lord, I account that we do but Justice to the Persons of many of our
Roman-Catholick Acquaintance in pronouncing of them, that they have no
PLOT but to get to Heaven, and to follow the last Dictates of their Pra|ctical
understandings as to the Mind of God reveal'd in the Scripture.
I shall tell your Lordship, that I entertaining my thoughts sometimes with
the great pacificatory ones of our Divines, have observd things there said
with sharpness enough against the Errors of Papists, and yet with great
sweetness as to the persons erring, and not only exempting these from odium
in their holding Problematick Tenets contrary to ours, but asserting their
just liberty so to do.
And because one of our Church of England-Divines who hath writ at that
rate, hath done it with a graceful mixture of wit and frankness, I shall here
entertain your Lordship with some of his passages about it.
I intend here to refer you to an excellent Sermon of Dr. Ingelo's, Preached
at S. Paul's, and Printed A. 1659. and where in p. 129. he saith, I am
afraid that Christian Religion will not recover for a good while, that honour
which is lost by the uncharitableness of the present Age. God grant that we
may return speedily to the sincerity of the Protestant Principles. We know
not what the Christian Religion is but by the Scriptures, and by them we may
know, for there it is plainly and fully set down. In things doubtful, if every
Christian may not interpret for himself; how shall we justifie the Protestants
Separation from the Roman Church, not to have been a Schism, and,
as the Papists say, an Apostacy from the true Church? They interpret one
way, and we another. And was not the rigid imposition of their interpreta|tions
as infallible, one of those good reasons for which we departed from
them? But when we read these Scriptures, They shall kill you, and think
they do God service, and, By zeal I persecuted the Church, and, They
have a zeal, but not according to knowledge; we may perceive that hot
zeal may be accompanied with gross ignorance, and great cruelty. Some
that mean well, perhaps, may do shrowd mischief, and through impotence
of Spirit, Inconsiderateness, ill Nature, narrowness of Soul, want of Expe|rience,
and converse with wise Men, c. may throw fire-brands into the
House of God.
It is a strange device of pleasing God, to sacrifice his Friends to him, when
as he desireth not the death of his Enemies. But those which kill them say,
O, but they are in errour. Really it may be so, for it is a very hard
matter for such fallible creatures as we are, not to erre in some things, c.
But those are unmerciful guides, which kill plain-hearted Passengers, be|cause
they have missed the way, when as it is likely that they, poor men,
could not help it. I, but they will not go into the way when they are
bidden. Well, but will they do it, when you have killed them? If they were
out of the way, you have made them for ever coming into it again. Since the
wanderer did not hearken to you, it may be that he knew nothing to the
contrary, but that you were as ignorant of the way, as himself. No, you
had a Book of it, wherein it was fairly mapp'd forth. That is, the Bible;
and he had it too. But you understand it better then he did. I cannot tell
that. However, are you infallible also? If you be not, you may be out of the
way your self, and if it should chance to prove so, you would be loath to be
cudgell'd into it again.

If you will glorify God, do as he doth. What is that? He declares his will,
teacheth us his Truth, engageth us with a thousand mercies, to do our duty;
and notwithstanding we continue our disobedience, he awaits our repentance
with a God-like patience. Wilt thou go and do likewise? No, because they
receive not Jesus Christ, I will call for fire from Heaven upon them.
Poor man! thou art of a hot spirit, and wouldest thou have it increased with
flames from above? that fire enlightens, warms, and so melts, but doth not
burn and fry men for their Salvation. Take heed what thou dost to others, c.
The common style in so many mens Writings of Religionary Controversie
is not more vexatious then that I have now entertain'd you with of this
learned Writer is charming. And indeed as turbid as this interval of time
is while Moral offices are calling upon us in our several Stations by all due
means to withstand Papal Usurpations (and which men of sense generally
mean by Popery) yet as to the Tenets of Transubstantiation and Purgatory
and others of that Nature, however so much disgusted by the bulk of the
Nation, such bulky and voluminous Controversial writing of them, as was
long ago in use, is nauseous to the age, and the time spent in reading Mat|ters
Pro and Con writ of such Subjects would now be judged as the diverting
Men from regular action in opposing any Papal Usurpations.
Who is at all concerned about extension or divisibility being the formalis
ratio of quantity, or at there being demonstration on either side, that hoth
the one and the other is so? But 'tis one man's extending his Confines on
those of another man's Estate, or his dividing a quota of it from him, that
naturally makes Controversie so hot and loud. When a man by pretending
to illuminate another about the next World stands in his light in this, and when
a handful of men would grasp all the Dignities of this World because of their
expectance of monopolizing those of the next (and which indeed should ra|ther
allay their Ambition in this according to that Saying,Si tam certa
manet gloria quid properas?) here the hinge of the Controversie turns so an|grily
between so many Protestants and so many Papists; tho yet I must here
acknowledge, that as I know Protestants enow, who neither repine at God's
or his Vice-gerent's choice of their Instruments, so I do Papists whose Mode|ration
is known to all men, and who are far from affecting any excessive over|balance
of Power in the Services of their Prince.
And were I for my Life to give our Roman-Catholick fellow-Subjects the
best advice I could for their own Preservation, it should be their using all
means possible to convince the world, that they affected nothing of such a
Paramount Power, and aimed at no such thing. Aufer ut uterque securius
dormiat, was said by the Stoick to him that was taking away his Riches in
the Night. I am sure I shall never repine at it, if ever there should be a
due or legal relaxation of any Penalties that may seem sanguinary in making
their Purses bleed, but shall be content with its being out of the Power of
such among them who affect a growth of their interests under the Pope as a
fifth Monarch, to render others of them liable to Envy who only endeavour
their growing in Grace under the Pope as their chief Spiritual Pastor. And
tho perhaps to advise any hot-Spurs among them to part with Power, may
seem durus sermo, as much as cutting off a Right hand that has long offen|ded
themselves and others; yet if it shall appear that by that means they will
secure all the Hands and Hearts of Protestants thereby for their defence,
they will gain more then Cent per Cent in the Exchange: as those who in
our Saviour's time forsook Houses and Lands for him, did according to his
promise gain a Thousand Fold by it in this life, by the Houses and Lands of
all other Christians then being at their service. It is chiefly by the abe|nunciation,
the study'd and labour'd declining of Power, that the Iews al|most

in all Countreys Christian and Pagan are welcom Guests, tho yet
by their frugal living they Generally under-sel the Natives every where.
Mankind hath such a sharp regret against Plotting the Ruine of any compa|ny
of men who are harmless and useful to the World, and in whom nothing but
a Tame Humble quiet innocence appears, that on the conrary they study
to be their Protectors, to be their Guards, their Watchmen, and men think|ing
God to be like themselves, they think such people are Heavens care too.
Therefore in the 88^t^h^. Advertisement of Boccalin's Ragguagli, the Sheep send|ing
their Embassadours to Apollo, desiring that they may be allowed to have
sharp Teeth and long horns, and not seem abandon'd by that Divine Charity that
hath given offensive as well as defensive arms to hurtful animals, by whom they
often Suffered, and sometimes by their very Shepherds who in Sheering them
would cut their Skins, Apollo told them, that no Beasts were so much the Favo|rites
of him and of men as they, for that whereas others with great anxiety were
forced in the Night, the time of rest and sleep, to seek their Food, that they could
not do with safety in the day, Men the Lords of the Earth bought at dear rates
pasture grounds for Sheep, and that tho men did make Nets, feed Dogs and lay
snares for hurtful Beasts, they employed Shepherds and Dogs to guard Sheep,
and that no Shepherds could deal ill with their Flocks without being chiefly cruel
to themselves, and that therefore their security lay in not being able to fright
their Shepherds.
Thus every one is naturally abhorr'd who attacks a Naked man, and from
such a one Lions themselves either through fear or generosity have made their
Retreat. The holy Writ affords us a memorable Instance of the Divine dis|pleasure,
in the 38th of Ezekiels Prophesie against Gog and Magog, who are
there branded as the Invaders of a defensless City, 'Tis there mention'd in
v. 10th and 11th. Thus saith the Lord God, it shall also come to pass, that at the
same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought;
and v. 11th. And thou shalt say, I will go up to the Land of unwalled Villages,
I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without
walls, and having neither Bars nor Gates; and in v. 12th, to take a spoil and to
take a prey, to turn thy hand upon the desolate places, that are now inhabited, and
upon the people that are gather'd out of the Nations which have gotten Cattel and
goods that dwell in the MIDST (or navel) of the land. But it then follows
v. 14. Therefore Son of man Prophecy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord
God, in that day when my people of Israel dwells safely, shalt thou not know it?
that is, thou shalt know it to thy sorrow and by thy bitter experience of my
wrath, what it is to disturb my harmless and quiet people in the World. The
Comparing of the following 16th and 18th v. shew this to be the meaning
of v. 14th. And I believe if any of the people of Gog and Magog were allow|ed
by the Law to live apart by themselves, they might in any defenceless Ci|ty
be as secure from danger or fear of the Protestant Israel as they pleased.
It hath been well observed by a great Enquirer into humane Nature, That
a restless desire of power after power that ceaseth only in death, is a general in|clination
of all mankind; and the cause of this is not alwaies that a man hopes
for a more intensive delight then he has already attained to, or that he cannot
be content with a moderate power, but because he cannot assure the power and
means to live well which he hath present without the acquisition of more:
And from hence it is that Kings whose power is greatest, turn their endeavours
to the Assuring it at home by Laws, or abroad by Warrs. But as much as it
is the inclination of the unthinking or brutish part of Mankind, that power
should be like the Crocodile alwaies growing, the soberer few do know, that
power will destroy it self if it shall be still ascending and hath not a Center
wherein to rest and be quiet, just as fire would perish in nature and destroy it

self, if there were not an Element allow'd it wherein to leave burning: And
that therefore Augustus wisely designed a Law de cohibendis imperii finibus,
And that the experience of Antient and Modern times hath taught the teach|able
part of mankind, That great Empires have sunk under their weight, and
have lost the length of their power by the widening it; and that Kings whose
power is greatest (as was said) sometimes turn their endeavours to the Assure|ing
it at home by Laws, which by giving it some bound are like letters a|bout
the edges of our coyn, Decus  tutamen to it, the which makes it so
Sacred, that 'twould be both Treasonable and Ridiculous to clip it, and that
as the Bees by their King have given the world an instance in Nature of
Kingly power, so they have likewise another of Kings governing by the power
of Laws. 'Tis a common observation, That tho Bees are little angry fight|ing
Creatures upon occasion, and leave their stings in the wounds they
make, Rex tamen apum sine aculeo est, the King of the Bees is without any
sting, and the curious work of the Hive goes on with a great deal of Geome|try,
and idle Drones are thence as it were legally expel'd who would there
invade property. Nor need the King of the Bees (say the Naturalists) have
a sting, for the whole Hive defends and guards him, as thinking that they
are all to perish if their King be destroyed.
And this would be the case of the Papists, if they would be content so to
part with the sting of their Power that it could not hurt either King or
Kingdom, and might not come to lose it self by so doing, they would have
the Posse of every County to defend them, they would have the Laws and
the whole Hive of English men to guard them, the very Anger of the Pro|testants
would be a defensive Wall of Fire round about them. 'Tis true, that
wild Animals are by their constant fears of danger habituated to more cun|ning
then Tame ones of the same species, but all their little cunning renders
them not so safe as the great wisdom  protection of the Law doth the other;
and ranging and out-lying Deer thrive not so well as those that are in the
Forrests. And here it falls in my way to observe, that the Kings caution|ing
by the Law of the Forrests, that the Mastiffs shall have the Power took
from them of hurting the Deer, may well insinuate into us the reason and e|quity
of all our Laws that hinder its being in the power of a man to be a
Wolf to another, and of the Power inherent by the Law of Nature in all So|veraign
Princes to restrain any undue Power of Subjects from violating the
Public peace. As the Law of God and Nature command both Iustice and
Mercy to be shewn to Beasts, so doth the Law of England provide that any
mans person and Estate should be seized into the Kings hands in case of some
wild cruelty to his Beasts; for he would appear in the eye of the Law an
Idiot or a Lunatic, that should put his Horses or Asses to the Sword.
That which I mention'd of the Laws providing that the Mastiffs of any
Inhabitants in Forrests shall not have Power to hurt the Deer, is called by
the Forrest Law, Lawing of Mastiffs, or the Expeditating them, that is the
three Claws of their Fore-foot to the Skin are to be cut off; and thus they
are to be law'd every three years for the preserving the Kings Game, and the
peace of his wild Beasts. The Regarders of the Forrest are to make a TRIEN|NIAL
enquiry about it  tunc fiat per visum  testimonium legalium homi|num
 non aliter, that is not Arbitrarily, there must be legal Judgment up|on
legal Testimony, and no Dog law'd without Judicial proceeding. This
Forrest Law made in the time of our Popish Ancestors, did suppose; that
the Kings Game could not be preserved, nor the Peace of his Wild Beasts,
by the Dogs being then either exorcised, or their lapping a little holy wa|ter,
or any expedient (as I may say) without expeditation, which did ipso facto
destroy their Power of destroying the Kings Game and the Peace of his

wild Beasts; and therefore that's the only valuable Garranty we can have
from those who without Law and against Law would hunt down the King
himself and his Tame Subjects, that the excrescence of their power should be
hambled or expeditated: but the modus of this I do again say ought by them
to be tendered to the Consideration of his Majesty and the Triennial Regar|dors
of the Kingdom. I am sure 'tis worthy the consideration of us English,
what the Learned Frenchman Monsieur Bodin tells us in his Book de Republica
Lib. 5. Cap. 6. Vna est tenuium adversus potentiores securitatis ratio, ut scili|cet
si nocere velint non possent, cum nocendi voluntas ambitiosis hominibus  im|perandi
cupidis nunquam sit defutura.
And now my Lord to give your Lordship a home Instance of Jealousie ta|king
Fire in some meerly from the power of another to do them hurt, I will
instance in your self at this conjuncture of time. The nature of Iealousie
renders it to be a troublesom weed and yet such an one that growes in the
Richest Soil of Love, my meaning is, that 'tis a fear of Love not being mu|tual
when one doth love intensely with desire of being so loved. My Lord, in
the picture of your mind that I have already drawn in this Letter, I have on|ly
done you a little right, and not at all favour'd you, and 'tis but Justice to
you to acknowledge that the Protestant part of your Country hath a singular
love for you, with a desire of being so loved by you; and 'tis in this Critical
conjuncture of time that your power makes them fear the love not to be mutual.
Your Lordship knows, that fear in people is an aversion with an opinion of
hurt from any object, and they soon hate those things or persons for which
they have aversion: and fear of hurt by power disposeth men naturally to an|ticipate,
and not to stay for the first blow, or else to crave aid from Society and
from others especially whose concern may be the same or greater then theirs,
and who are their representatives, and to wish ill to those who make them
sleep in armour, or to stand in the posture of Gladiators with their weapons
pointing, and their eyes fixed on another, and to be still in procinctu, and all
those passions sprung from the Root of Jealousie, as far as they exceed the
bounds of reason, are degrees of madness. And tho mans life be a constant
motion, and for the most part in both a Rugged way and near Precipices, yet
during that madness men are still by their own Scorpions scourging it to make
it move faster then the regular and intended pace of Nature, and injuring
themselves with their passions, are content too to wound another through
their own sides. And thus my Lord give me leave to tell you, That 'tis a
kind of a Complement from people to a great good man of whose power and of
whom they are jealous, when that it may be said of them, that they are occa|sionally
faln mad for love of him.
One part of your Power, namely that wherein you are a Conduit-Pipe to
convey the grants of Honour and profit from your Royal Master, the Foun|tain
of Honour, 'tis possible for you to quit, and that with pleasure too, that
you may have time to quench your great thirst after knowledge in that
great collection of waters into which so many Streams of learning have met
from all ages and Nations, I mean your vast and choice Library. And I may
well suppose that your Lordship hath now that sense of Greatness and of pow|er
by publick Employment, that Cardinal Granvel expressed at his retirement
from the same, That a great Man is like a great River, where many sorts of
Creatures are still quenching their thirst, but are likewise still muddying and
troubling the Stream. Your Lordship knows who said, th actio est conversa|tio
cum stultis, lectio cum sapientibus. In the Scene of the busie World you are
necessarily troubled with the affaires of men whose being born was unnecessa|ry
to the world, and there you are usually put to play at hard games well with
ill gamesters, the jest that fortune playing in humane affires commonly puts

on the wise to spoil their busie sport: there you are sometimes deafen'd with
Complaints of Mimick Apes and grave Asses, of airy fools and formal fops one
against another: but in your noble Library you have the advantage of the
still Musick of the Tomb, you have the weight of many dead Authors making
no noise, you have Socinus and Calvin standing quietly by each other, and
some Authors content with the dust of your Library who thought one
Christian world not enough to trouble; 'tis there you will avoid any trou|ble
by Authors of gilded outsides intruding, nor be molested as now by nonsense
in fine clothes. You cannot now quietly enquire after the fountain of Nile
for the noise of its Cataracts, nor appease your thirst after knowledge other|wise
then tanquam canis ad Nilum for fear of the Crocodiles of the World de|vouring
you, nor have a view of the tree of knowledge without a Serpent of
envy circled about it, nor have time to look on the pieces painted for eterni|ty,
nor to mind the Eclipses in the Heavens while you are preventing your
own being eclipsed in the Earth.
But my Lord, there is another kind of power inherent in you, and that you
cannot part with, such a power as King Charles the first in his Eikon Basil.
affixes to the Character of his favorite, when he sayes, he looked on the Earl
of Strafford as a Gentleman whose great abilities might make a Prince rather
afraid then ashamed to employ him in the greatest affaires of State. Your very
Reputation for power is power, for that engageth those to adhere to you, who
want protection. Your Success in your past conduct of publick affaires is
power, for it makes men promise to themselves good fortune while they fol|low
you. Your eloquence that fastens mens ears to your lips is power. Your
great knowledge in the Law whereby you possess that Engine by which you
can be only attacked, and whereby you have that fastness, where one-a-brest
can keep down a Multitude, is power. Your affability and good Nature that
endear you to so many, is power, and makes the hearts of men to be your
Pyramids. And all these sorts of power in you, which make every party wish
you to be theirs, make up so bright a beauty in your mind, as may well
cause jealousie in that party that by loving you, think they have Right to be
again beloved by you; I mean the English Protestants, who court you, and
to whom you have so long engaged your self, and especially when they shall
find their Rivals boast of the kindness you have for them; and that too at
such a time as this, when the Protestants seem to have the concern of one that
is playing his last stake, and which only can make him fetch back all he has
lost; a time, when any one who pretends to a cold harmless neutrality, doth
really intend an exulcerated hatred; a time, wherein he that is not with us
is against us, however it may have hapned, that in some lazy conjunctures
when Papists and Protestants were half asleep both here and in the Neigh|bouring
Continent, that then he that was not against us was with us; a time,
cum non de terminis sed de tot possessione agitur; A time, wherein as in
that of the tempest that happen'd to the Ship that carried Iona among the
heathen Mariners, we see almost all, namely the Papists calling on their God,
and the Church of England likewise, and the dissenters in the several persuasi|ons
on theirs, with this difference, that no man is now asleep, but all in it are
waking, some at work to save the Ship, and others to bore holes in it, as if
they were concerned to have it cast away as being not owners in it, and as if
they had secured their own merchandize in it which they purchased by the
money they took up at Bottomry from Rome or its agents, and knew how to
secure themselves in the Cock-boat.
We have had dull and lazy conjunctures of timeheretofore, insomuch
that many years ago a Divine seemed to begin a Sermon on the Gun-powder
Treason day before a great Academick audience, as it were yawning and in his

sleep with these words, Conspiracies if not prevented, are rather dangerous then
otherwise: And thus the ingenious Comedy tells us of a Hero, that as he was
in the height of his passion with the greatest zeal making Love, instantly dropt
down into a deep sleep; but 'tis no time for yawning when the Earth begins
to yawn under us. And tho times have been heretofore influencing the Pro|testant
cause like the Sun in March that could only raise the vapors of Popery
in the body of the Nation and not dissipate them, 'tis now supposed to be o|therwise,
and as I have heard that the Earl of Hallifax in his Speech in the
house of Lords having spoken of his hatred to Popery, excellently well added
somewhat to this effect, And we may now exterminate it if we will. And
therefore with that now, I think the ecce nunc tempus acceptabile festina  sal|vare,
may be applyed to the Kingdom. And if as the School-men tell us, An|gels
may dance upon the point of a Needle, we may imagine many both good
and bad ones dancing on this point of time; 'tis on this moment the Nations
eternity depends. Every one now is as good a Conjurer as Friar Bacon, and
can make a Brazen head say time is; by which words I believe the learned
Roger Bacon meant only, that in the vessel of Brass wherein the exquisite chy|mical
preparations for the birth of gold were laboured, the nick of opportuni|ty
was to be watched under pain of the loss of all the fire and Materials, and
art and labour, according to that of Petrus Bongus. Ibi est operis perfectio aut
annihilatio, quoniam ipsa die imm hor, oriuntur elementa simplicia depurata quae
egent statim compositione, antequam volent abigne, as I find him cited by Brown
for it in his vulgar errors, where he further saith, Now letting slip this critical
opportunity, he missed the intended Treasure, which had he obtained, he might
have made out the tradition of making a brazen wall about England, that is, the
most powerful defence and strongest fortification which Gold could have effected.
My Lord, my opinion was askt in a letter from a very honest Gentleman
and much your Lordships Servant, Whether you should not do your self and
your Religion a greatdeal of Right, by printing in this juncture some of the ex|cellent
and large discourses you have formerly writ against Popery? and the sub|stance
of the answer I gave him was to this effect, That tho I would not diswade
your Lordships now publishing any thing relating to the tenets of that preten|ded
Religion that might import Protestants to understand more cleerly then
they did, in which way they have been advantaged by the Bishop of Lincoln's
Book against Popery, yet that I thought the great bulk of Popery could no
more be destroyed by notions and arguments, then a capital Ship could be sunk
with bullets, for that supposing they did all light between wind and water, the
Papists have thousands of Plugs ready to be clapt in there, and thousands of men
in that great vessel ready to apply them, and tho I thought there was a time for
writing of Books, it was when there was a time for reading them, that is, when
people had time to read them, but that now the most curious works of White|akers,
and Iewels, and Rainoldses, would be no more regarded, then attempts of
shewing the longitude would be to Navigators while under the attack of a Fire|ship
as I said, or while they were making their way through the body of an
Enemies Fleet. I know that 'tis said to be an old Sybilline Prophecy, that Anti|christ
shall be destroyed by paper viz. Antichristum lino periturum, but alas,
that way is now as insignificant in the case, as to think that the dominion of
the Sea can be built up by Seldens Mare Clausum, or destroyed by Grotius his
Mare Liberum, or any way but by thundring Legions in powerful fleers.
Indeed our paper pellets that the press since its licence hath shot against
Popery, I mean the innumerable little sheet-pamphlets that have come out
against it may find time to be read, and to give us diversion, but the Papists
looking on their Church as a great First-Rate Mann'd with Popes and Em|perors,
and Princes, and Fathers and Councels, and innumerable Souls there

embarqued in the Sea of time for the great Voyage of Eternity, do account
our little Protestant honest Sheet-authors firing at them daily to be only like
the Yacht-Fan Fan's attacking De Ruyter.
But my Lord, there is another Reason why a person of your Lordships
great Power and Abilities should not at this time embarrase your self with
writing, No not those defences of your innocency, which yet perhaps may be
necessary to be done for the use of those who know you not hereafter when
the heat of the day and your Services in this critical juncture shall be over,
and would now shew as meanly as if a General in the time of Battel having
some dirt or dust lighting on his face, should while he was among the bullets
employ his barbers washballs to cleanse it, and that too when the fate of the
battel seems to totter and is near decision one way or other, and while there is
hardly room for the Quid agendum to wedge it self in, and he that saith consi|der
is almost a foe, (and therefore once when a great Commander had no way
to save himself and his Army but by their swimming with their horses through
a River to attack their Enemy, he did only to that question of quid agendum
put to him by his Officers, suddenly eccho back the reply of agendum, and with
his horse took the River) and while now 'tis with us as on board a Ship in the
time of Fight, or of a Storm when they are Fighting with the Elements, and the
Master or Steersman orders any thing to be done, the case will bear no dilatory
answer of words, and the answer there is, Done it is; I say, after all this, that
there is a reason which in my opinion renders any mans writing unnecessary
now either to the World or himself, and that is this, That words and Lan|guage
the which formerly having the stamp of common usage and of reason
on them passed as currant coine for the Signification of mens minds and as
a medium of commerce, are in this juncture as useless that way, and of as little
value as lether coine called in: and this Age wherein both the word and
thing called shamme, hath been brought in use, and shamme calls it self an answer
to that great question, What is wit? tho with as little reason as if a lye should
call it self an answer to that old great question, What is truth, hath inforced
those that do not love to be shamm'd upon, not to measure mens actions by their
words, but their words by their Actions. And tho a mans written books are
called his works, yet have I observed an occasion of Sarcasme given thereby,
when one speaking of a particular Divines excellent writings, said he loved
his works, but hated his actions. And written works are now indeed but act|ings
as when a man doth agree gestum in scena on the Stage of the World, and
for them he finds but only a Theatrical applause, Nor so much as that, when
like the Actor crying O heavens, he looks down on the Earth.
As he is alwaies accounted but a smatterer in knowledge who is a pedant, or
petty-Chapman in words, so he playes but at small games in politicks, who is a
pedant or trader in words, or who indeed will give any thing for them. He
who doth verba dare has bad morals, and who gives any thing else for them
has bad intellectuals, and according to that old Monkish verse they said,
Res dare pro rebus, pro verbis verba solemus.
The only real security therefore that the World hath for its quiet, is mens only
giving a seeming belief to seeming professions and protestations; for as Ayr
out of its place makes Earth-quakes, so if the articulate air of mens words gets
beyond my hearing into my belief, it may there raise those commotions of
passion that may make me trouble both my self and the World, and particular|ly
by the passion of jealousie before-mentioned, on my desire where I have a
kindness that it should be mutual, and when positive words brought me into
the fools paradise of believing it possible, a thing perhaps not possible in na|ture,
that two bodies and minds whose faculties must needs be different,
should have an equal intenseness of love for each other, no president of friend|ship,

particularly that of Ionathan and David, having shewn it, and in the con|jugal
love the passions of the weaker Sex being observed to be the strongest, and
that of jealousie as well as Love jealousie particularly being most potent in minds
most impotent, and in persons most diffident of themselves. And this may in
some sort console your Lordship after all your restless endeavours to merit the
love of all your Countrymen if it be not exactly mutual. But this by the
way.
The great names of Protestant and Religion began to adorn each o|ther
in the year of our Lord 1529, when some of the Electors and Princes of
the Empire with a protestation opposed the Decree relating to the Mass and
Eucharist, made at Spiers, and when some of the Capital Cities of Germany
joyn'd with them to protest the same thing. But every one knows that a
protestation is a revocable thing, and that a Protestation contrary to actions re|vokes
it self. And that the word Protestant, hath not been in the World as
the Poets term is of calling grass green, or the like, otiosum epitheton, I believe
the Papists will grant: and 'tis not one Protestation made and not revoked ei|ther
by words or actions, that can make that term consistent with our Religi|on,
or render a man worthy to be call'd one. 'Tis not a good continual claim
to our Religion that yet is for land we are disseis'd of that is made only once
a year whilst we live: No; the Protestation that the Protestant Religion re|quires,
is such a continual one as is reiterated, upon every fresh act and at|tempt
of the Papal Religion against ours; 'tis not a going to our Cells, and
saying, Lord have mercy upon us, but 'tis our watching in our Stations, and
our shewing no mercy to the principles of Popery that are alwaies attacking
the quiet of the World either by Storm or Siege, or undermining; 'tis like the
Protestation required when the defendant hath declined a Judge, that
must be made toties quoties as any new Act is done by the Judge, without
which the first Protestation grows insignificant: 'tis not one Act of protesting
the Popes Bills of Exchange for good money we paid him, and his giving us
bank-tickets upon purgatory, or giving us some fantastick Saints pretended
Hair or Nailes (protested with so much scorn by our Popish Ancestors in Hen|ry
the 8th's time, that a piece of St. Andrews finger covered with an ounce of Sil|ver
pawn'd by a Monastery for forty pound, was left unredeemed at the dis|solution
of it, which shewed that that commodity would even then yeild
nothing, and was a meer drug in Scotland (of which Country he is call'd the
Saint Protector) but 'tis further like a protestation against the Sea at the next
Port made toties quoties goods in a Ship are damnified by its rage, which the
law requires the Skipper to make, or else leaves answerable for the dammage.
And if a poor Tarpauling who must alwaies plough the Sea for his bread
during life, and there still contest with the angry Elements, shall when he
comes on shore by a protestation bid defiance to the pride of the whole Ocean,
he deserves not the name of a Hero that Safe-guarded by both the Land and
the Law of the Land, shall not on occasions offered continually have the cou|rage
to protest against the dammages both his King and Country have from the
Rage of Popery. My Lord, I have been the longer in discoursing of the in|significancy
of words, or indeed ought, but the emphasis of works requisite to
shew a Protestant faith at this Juncture, because I am sure you are willing (as
you may well be) to joyne issue on that point, and to be judged a Protestant in
mans day by your works, as you must in Gods stand or fall by the Test of
them, at the last Audit, and to appear a Protestant too by works above the
poor level of a dull opus operatum, by works that represent the continual em|ployment
of your life with an Heroical vigour, and your going from strength to
strength (as the Scripture expression is) in the defence of Protestancy, by works
that speak you like the heavenly bodies incessant in your influence, and have|ing
rest only in Motion. 'Tis not without wisdom ordered by the Pope, That

no men shall be Cannonised till after death for fear of Apostacy; nor then like|wise,
unless it shall appear that they wrought Miracles. And the truth is, our
people were all so far born with Popes in their bellies, as to this point, that
they will not now Cannonize any Great Men for Protestant Saints, unless at
this time they do Miracles; and indeed I think they have reason to insist on
their doing as great miracles for our Religion, as any Papal Saints dead or
alive have done against it. And when I consider the real Great Things that
have been by the heads and hands of your Lordship and other Noble Persons
performed for the Statuminating of the Protestant cause, and enabling us to
say to our underminers with the confidence of the Psalmist, As a bowing wall
shall ye be, and as a tottering fence, I do think you may expect with Justice
that which is greater then our praise, the acclamations of our blessing, as Ari|stotle
saith, that to heroick qualities in men not praise, but pronouncing blessed is
due () and as St. Paul saith, it is more blessed to
give then to receive.
And here, my Lord, going by this exact Rule of measuring things by
things, and not by words, your Life hath enabled me to give the strictest
Aeropagus of Censurers the world can produce, and who would damn the use
of Proems and the art of moving passions by words, an irrefragable instance
how you have secured the Nation formerly from being enslaved to and by
Popery, and at that time when we seemed to our selves as secure from it as
from Mahumetanisme, which was when you were the great Conductor of
the Publick Councels in the Conjuncture that brought in the King, and hin|dred
Lambert's usurpation of the English Scepter, who tho at that time he was
not generally suspected to be a Papist, was on very rational grounds believed
to be such then by many very knowing particular persons; and that too to be
not only a Papist, but a Iesuited one. He was at that time suspected by some
for having advised at a military cabal of the then great ones that the Cavaleers
should be Massacred, a cruelty that could enter into no breast but one aban|doned
to Jesuitisme. And as on such a Monster your Lordship then had your
eye on him: and of his being such some of the depositions and examinations took
about the late plot have been very particular and satisfactory. Nor is his have|ing
petition'd some few years before the discovery of the late Plot, That he
might have his Liberty, and of a very great Roman Catholic Lord's having
then offer'd to be security for his quiet demeanor, Now unknown, so that
the Kingdom then scaped falling into Popery before the danger was by it ap|prehended;
like the Man who in the Night scaped that of Rochester Bridge,
and whom the light of the following day almost confounded with his deli|verance.
Your Lordships activity and prudence appearing in the public
Councels and in your Secret correspondences, to the defeating of the coun|cels
of that Romish Achitophel, and seisure of his person, will no more be
forgiven you by the Papists of England, then it either by the Papists of
England or Ireland will be forgiven or forgot that you shew'd your self a
true Father of your Country in Ireland, in the Conduct foremention'd of
that great Affair of the Metropolis, and many Garrisons of that Kingdom
being wholly put into the hands of the Parliament, rather than the Child
(as I may say) should be divided between any of his Majesties Subjects, and
the Pope the pretended supream Father of that Country, and that you pre|served
it to come into the hands of the true Supream One.
Your Lordship and other well-wishers to the Crown then were not of
the humour of some of our young vulgar Protestants, who as the Papists
parrots, have been by them taught to speak it commonly, That they love a
Papist better than a Presbyterian. 'Tis sinful not to love the persons of both,
but ridiculous to love the Yoke of either opinion; and it seems his late

Majesty of glorious Memory, and his Councel, and his noble Lieutenant of
Ireland, and your Lordship thought it safer for the Crown, for Ireland to be
trusted with that sort of disobedient Children that depended on no forraign
Ecclesiastical Head, then on such as did. And it is to be acknowledged to
your Lordships care of the freedom of your Country, that when you sat in
the long Parliament till you and other Members thereof were torn thence
by Cromwel's Souldiers, you crusht the Iure-divinity of Presbytery in the Egg
by its being ordered to be setled only for three years, so that it saw it was to
be expeditated at the end of three years, and had no power to trample upon
the consciences of others, and in effect had but a tolleration. I think that no
Church-Government at all is better then that rigid one of Presbytery intend|ed
then by some Zealots. As the good and learned Dean of Canterbury said
in his Sermon on the Fifth of November before the House of Commons, That
as to Popery, 'twere better there were no revealed Religion, and that humane
Nature were left to the conduct of its own principles and inclinations, then to
be acted by a religion that inspires men with so wild a fury, and prompts them to
commit such outrages, c. and there renders Popery worse then Infidelity or
no Religion, and so indeed in fact the Kingdom had then no Church-Govern|ment
paramount at all in it, and instead of the imagined fierce pedagogy of the
Scotch Presbytery that made every Levite a Rabby Busy, every Pulpit
Rhetor a Consul, and every Lay-Elder Major General of the Parish, we had a
tame insignificant Government admitted only to probation for three years,
and were no more hindered of the freedom of a Gentlemans Conversation
thereby then by the Government of the foremention'd Presbyter Iohn in the
East, and England was then not only free from the charge of Peter-pence, Lega|tine
levys, oblations, contributions for the Holy Land, and both charge and trouble
from all the Papal Courts and Masses Anniversaries, obits, requiems, dirges, pla|cebos,
Trentals, lamps, but from all contumacy fees in spiritual Courts, and from
those Courts themselves of which yet the yoke is very easie compared with ei|ther
that of the Papists or Scotch Presbyters; and our condition, as to ecclesia|stical
discipline, was like that time or conjuncture of liberty, that Father Paul
in the History of the Councel of Trent refers to, speaking of the time when a
certain custome prevailed, saith, il, che come e un uso molto proprio, diove si go|verna
in liberta, quale era all hora quando il mondo era senza Papa, That it was
a custome very proper where they governed with liberry, which was when the
world was without a Pope.
I never heard of any man that was gored with the horn of our Presbyters
excommunication, nor of any dissenter from them, that was tyed up for them
out of their horn of plenty of Church power to force a drench of Doctrine
down his throat, and much less of any dealt with in that way mentioned by
Spotswood, in his Observation, that the Devil would not be feared but for his
horn, referring to the horning in Scotland, that is, the seisure of all a mans goods
when the horn blew, after he was excommunicated by the Presbytery.
There is no doubt but that some of the Divines of that persuasion were
brib'd to it by an expectation of power to oppress, when that the great Reve|nues
of the Church were denied them; And thus the Pope keeps his Guards
in Rome only with the pay of priviledges, but instead of their riding the Peo|ple,
the Parliament rid them, and with that caution as they of old did who
rid on Elephants in battel, which great animal being observed to be then un|ruely
sometimes and to endanger both the riders and their camp, and it be|ing
known that their receiving a Conusion in one part about their head,
would presently dispatch them, their riders had alwaies a hammer with them
ready for that use on occasion.

He therefore that saith he loves popery better then the Government of
Presbytery as it was de facto setled or rather permitted in England, and when
they that would have its maypole for them to dance about had it, and those that
would have none, had none, saith that he loves a fiery and tormenting furious
Church-Government that would make Mount Sion to be still belching out fire
like Aetna better then none at all: that he loves a Hirricane better then be|ing
a while becalm'd: that he loves the Church government that was like colo|quintida
in the pot, rather then that of the Presbyter, which was here but
like Herb Iohn, and that he fears a Mastiff who was not only hambled and
whose jus divinum was lawd, and whose spleen was cut out by the State Chi|rurgeons
more then an incensed hungry Lion of Rome: that he likes a Govern|ment
better that at best is like a Peacock, that is all Gaudery and damned Noise
and nothing else except pede latro, that is, all Ceremony, and devouring all
with ceremony, then a Government that with its looks can neither allure nor
fright, and which we could pinion as we pleased, and play with till we could
get a better in its Room. Whether a Papist was to be loved better then a
Puritan was a vex'd question in the time of Queen Elizabeth and 'twas resol|ved
then in the affirmative only by the Pensioners of Rome and their depen|dants.
The Learned Author of the Book called Certain considerations tending to
promote Peace and good will among Protestants, doth in p. 13. quote our famous
Gataker for relating that Dr. Elmor Lord Bishop of London in Queen Eliza|beths
time, when one in a Sermon at St. Pauls Cross inveighing against Puritans,
rendred them worse then Papists, sharply contradicted that censure, saying,
that the Preacher said not right therein, for that the Puritans if they had me
among them would only cut my rochet, but the Papists would cut my throat,
and that his Successor Dr. Vaughan Lord Bishop of London, when another in
the same Pulpit too shew'd the same eagerness in representing the Puritans
worse then Papists, expressed the same sense with his predecessor concerning
it, and wished that he had had the Preachers Tongue that day in his Pocket. It
was (it seems) then the good fortune of London, to be blest with Bishops re|nown'd
for their great zeal for the Protestant Religion, and with such a one it
is at this time enriched and dignified, I will not say Bishop of it only by
divine permission, but miseratione divin, the Style I have seen of Bishops in
some antient Instruments, 'tis out of the Divine Compassion that such an emi|nent
Protestant City has such a Prelate. Nor do I intend by the just praise
paid to this great and good man, to lessen the worth of others of the Fathers
of our Church, of which number I have the honour to be acquainted with o|thers
who endeavour the extermination of Popery, with as couragious a
zeal as can be wisht, and no doubt but the text of Scripture in the Title of my
Lord Bishop of Lincolns book, namely, Come out of her my People lest ye be par|takers
of her Sins and Plagues, is by the whole Church of England, lookt on as
a seasonable alarm, and no doubt many of this our Church who have writ with
so much various learning and strong Reason against Popery, know that if that
ever be de facto and by law paramount, the Church of England will be ipso facto
crusht thereby out of all its visibility. The thought of this brings that Scrip|ture
to my mind, viz. Matthew 21 v. 44. and who soever shall fall on this Stone,
shall be broken, but on whom soever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. And
if the Church of England by only falling super hanc Petram, I mean heretofore
by the Empty Project of some for the Uniting Rome to us, was broken and
disjointed, therefore if ever it shall come under the Stone of the Roman Catho|lick
Religion, and it be thereby made possible for the Stone to fall on it, the
Church of Rome will then grind it to powder. Its former falling on the
Rock could only break it into the pieces of Presbyterian and Independent,

and other seperate Churches, but that Rocks falling on it will not break it into
pieces but grind it to powder as was said; and perhaps Papists then from this
place of Scripture would form as good a title by divine right to crush our
Church, as they did from the super hanc Petram in the 16th of Matthew for
the building of theirs. But this by the way.
And now putting the Question who are to be loved best, either the Po|pish
Priest and Levite that help'd to wound Ireland formerly when it fell
among Thieves and Rebels, or those compassionate Samaritans who put it
on their own Beast and poured Oyl into its Wounds, and took care of it
till it was restored to its true Owner? I suppose a Protestant will say the latter,
and will account that no fire should be called to fall on the heads of such hospi|table
Samaritans, and that others should be spared, who instead of powring
Oyl into our Wounds, did it into our flames when they burnt our Citie.
Your Lordship hath shewn your self a compassionate Samaritan to Two
Kingdoms to which your healig principles and practices have been bene|ficial,
and in this you have out done him in the Parable who did not stay to
see the effects of the gentle Medicaments of Oyl and Wine he bestowed on
his Patient's Wounds, but your Lordships long attendance on the affairs of
the Public brought you to see the Languishing Kingdom revived, and to
have at once both its Head and Senses restored when Providence made our
Sovereign to be his repenting Peoples choice. But, my Lord, these King|doms
have not yet done with your Skill, and may have Wounds that re|quire
your Wine and Oyl, the Lyons Heart, and Ladies Hand; I mean such
Tenderness and such Courage, and so great Judgment as you have formerly
shewn, A Raging Acute Disease that hath been long not only besieging but
storming a mans vital parts, and with extream difficulty at the long run
repell'd by Nature, doth yet commonly leave such dregs in his spirits that
depress and enfeeble them in the remainder of Life, and a man come to
himself after a long madness, labours still under a dejection of his spirits
both by grief and shame, thinking of the arrear that he is in to God, the
World, and himself, by his former madness: and this is the present state of
England after its former state of distraction; and men with shame now look
on their former Physitians, and some are apt with that Merry Mad-man in
the Poet, to be angry with those that took pains about their being cured.
'Tis true indeed, the Kings Restoration cured us of our Civil Wars, yet
may a man be cured of his Wounds, and afterward dye of the Feaver his
Wound put him into; and our condition is such, that 'tis some degree of
Heavens Mercy to us, that our Feaver is continuing, for no man can dye
in a Feaver, as no man can dye without one: And our spirits are so sunk
under the weight of the Disease we have long languisht under, that our
Stomach cannot endure any Cordials, or especially the same long:  certainly
that strong Physic that would at first have cured us, would now kill us.
Yet now in this conjuncture several of our Political Physitians seem by
their retirement to have given us over, as if they were of Hippocrates his
mind, who said, that a Physitian should not discredit his generous Medicaments
by employing them on a desperate Patient.
Methinks 'tis pity that any of our Pilots should quit the Helm in a Storm, and
that they should not (as Cicero's expression is) Sententiam tanquam aliquod navi|gium
ex Reip. tempestate moderari. Those words in Prov. 1. A man of under|standing
shall attain to wise Councels; some read, Vir saepiens gubernacula possidebit;
I presume not to Censure any man, but I hope that no cross Winds will ever
make your Lordship leave the Helm, but rather invite the continuance of
your Skill in beating and tiding it out (as the Sea phrase is) and in not overshoot|ing
the Port. Your pacific Genius and great Wisdom have in several angry con|junctures

produced an unexpected calm by your offering unexpected Ex|pedients,
a Talent that is indeed very rare and conducive to the quiet of the
World, as leading Potent Parties from their declared Opinions without the
shame of a seeming retreat.
It happens still in Navigation, that what makes the Passenger merriest,
makes the Steers-man most thoughtful, Namely the sight of Land: And
therefore tho I and others who make no figures in the government of the
Kingdom seem to be glad at our sight of land, that is the extermination of
Popery from England after we have been so long nauseated and Sea-sick with
it, yet 'tis now our occasion for the skill of such a Pilot, as your Lordship is
greatest when we are endanger'd by some Protestants of narrow Spirits and
Principles as by Shelfes or brevia  syrtes, shallow waters, and by little Rocks
or breaker's just covered with water and which are only to be discovered by
the swelling roughness of the water they occasion. It has pleased Divine pro|vidence
to cast your Lordships whole life of Action into difficult times such
as are called in the New Testament  and translated perilous
times, And such as Cicero calls Maxima Reipublicae tempora, and difficillima
Reip tempora. Your life hath been a continual contestation with principles
pernicious to man-kind, and you have been under your Prince a Nutritius
pater for the most part to men who have like froward and unquiet
Children been crying for each others properly in things civil, and in Religi|on,
and have thought themselves persecuted when they could not persecute
others; Nor have you been too much a Latitudinarian as to Church discipline,
Nor of too narrow a Spirit or principles as to any Protestant Dissenters. And
I think Envy never charged you for giving any advice that tended to the
injuring the ballance of Christendom, or the power of England in setling it,
or the persuading us to love some of our Neighbours better then our selves.
You who are so far from offending any weak brother, That you are ready with
the Apostle rather to abstain from eating flesh while the World stands, and
therefore will much less kill or devour him, and lest of all will you offend a
weak Brother-Protestant Country or help any else to devour it: and will not
injure any of those Countreys that you visited abroad (when the world and
you saw one another) by projecting their Mischief. And therefore as I find
in the Prolegomena of Grotius de jure belli  pacis that Themistius, speaking to
Valens the Roman Emperor he told him that Kings if they would be guided by
the Rule of true wisdom they must non unius sibi creditae Gentis habere rationem,
sed totius humani generis,  esse non  tantum aut  sed
, so it may be justly said that the Counsellors of Kings should al|waies
advise them, not to take care only of the concern of their own people
but of the happiness and quiet of all man-kind, and not only to be lovers of
the Macedonians, or lovers of the Romans, but to be lovers of Men. I never
heard your Lordship reproacht for having any interest contrary to that of
your Country or indeed to the repose of Christendom. And as in Nature we
see all heavy bodies tend by their own Center to the Center of the Universe, so
have I still thought that your Lordship alwaies endeavoured by the pursuing
your own good to pursue that of the Kingdom, and that your endeavours of
promoting the good of your own Country have tended to the good of the
World: And that in every Scheme of your Politicks whether Civil or Ec|clesiastical
pollicy you have took your Model from the Great Architect of
Nature doing things fortiter and suaviter and with regard to his works of
which 'tis said in the 8th of Wisdom, Mightily and Sweetly doth she order all
things.
And he that builds so, is a Workman that need not be ashamed either of him|self
or of his work, that is both strong and fair: such a Councellor need

not be ahamed of his Councel. 'Tis one of the worst sort of Reproaches to
which a Councellor at Law can be exposed, to be called a crafty Counsel, that
is, one who secretly gives advice for the perverting of Justice and the law;
and to do that vile thing is more odious in a Counsellor of State: And of
this subject when I formerly discoursed to your Lordship, I remember you
were pleased to say it of your self to me, That you had a great aversion from
giving whispering Councel, to your Royal Master, and that it hath been your
humble motion to him, to command his Councel to give him their advice in
writing.
Your Lordship is by one particular accident a necessary subject for the
Worlds compassion, namely by your having out-lived most of the eye wit|nesses
of the many memorable things you have done for the World. If the
people of England your Contemporaries were six Millions at the time of your
birth, five of those Millions are now lodged in graves, persons above the Age
of Sixty making but a sixth part of Mankind. I reading lately in Tully de Se|nectute,
was pleased with what he saith of old men both de facto  de jure
praising themselves: he saith there, videtisne ut apud Homerum saepissim
Nestor de virtutibns suis praedicet? Tertiam enim jam aetatem hominum vixe|rat:
he had lived almost 300 years when he went with the other Grecians
to the Trojan War, and where he gave such weighty advice, that Agamemnon
said he should make quick work of the taking of Troy if he had ten such Coun|cellors
as Nestor was; Quod si acciderit non dubitat quin brevi Troja sit peritu|ra.
He never wish'd, saith Tully, to have ten Ajaxes. It seems the Gene|ral
thought that an old Commander would be weighed down with a tenth
part of an old wise Councellor. But Nestor had bury'd all those thrice over
who were born with him, and he lived to see his Country-men doubled once
and a half (200 years being the space judged for a Nations doubling) and if he
would have his Atchievments in his first Century Celebrated and witnessed, he
must be his own Herald and witness in his own cause. I will not apply Ne|stors
case to your Lordships, as to your doing right to your self by praise, for
you have no more occasion to do that then Tully had who saith there, Nihil
necesse est mihi de meipso dicere, quanquam est id quidem senile aetatique nostrae
Conceditur: But do think that any Protestant Prince who can say he hath
ten such Councellors, and resembling your Lordship in the experience of
near fifty years spent in the affairs of State in critical times, and with success,
and equal to you in all orts of Learning, and in the knowledge of the Law
and publick Records, and in Eloquence and Courage, as well as in the hatred
of Popery, he may add, Qud non dubitat quin brevi Roma sit peritura. i. e.
without such dilatory Troy Sieges as have been formerly laid to it. He saith
elsewhere, Apex senectutis est autoritas. Quanta fuit in L. Caecilio Metelio!
quanta in Attilio Calatino, in quem illud elogium unicum, Vno ore plurimae con|sentiunt
Gentes, populi primarium fuisse virum.
And this Authority or Reverence of old age is so weighty, that it seems
reasonable that in the criminating one that hath this badge of Nature there
should be what Tully calls authoritas testimonii, and any single witness had need
to have an allowance se primarium fuisse virum that would convict such a
man; for diamonds are not to be cut but with the dust of diamonds. 'Tis
not for nothing that the Scripture cautions the not receiving an accusation a|gainst
an Elder but by two or three witnesses, and I am told that the Canon-Law
requires seventy two Witnesses to convict a Cardinal who is a Bishop ac|cused
of any crime but heresie, and forty four in the conviction of a Cardinal
Presbyter, and twenty six to convict a Cardinal Deacon, and seven to convict
any Clerk. And therefore I think that it was a commendable tenderness and
worthy of English Judges in a Trial at the Kings-Bench, to acquaint the Jury,

that they are to weigh and consider the credibility of witnesses pardon'd for
perjury; and both the Judges of the Kings-Bench and Common-Pleas resolved
it, That the credit of such a person was left to the breast of a Jury. The Bishop of
Rome who claims that Monarchiall power which is potestas restituendi in inte|grum
Sententiam passos,  quandoque absolvendi paenam  non infamiam quando|que
 poenam  infaniam abolendi, and who as Aquinas saith (2. 2ae q. 68. ar 4.)
potest infamiam Ecclesiasticam remittere, yet allows the School-men to apply
distinctions to that priviledge of his, and to interpret it of infamia Iuris, not
Facti, for labem illam quae turpi facto annexa est, nemo delere potest, as Soto con|cludes
De Iustit.  Iure l. 5. q. 5. ar. 4. No man who ever he be can wash out
that stain of infamy which by Nature is inherent in a foul wicked Act, because
(saith he) ad praeteritum non est potentia, when the infamy is inherent by the
Nature of the fact and not positive by Law. But still our merciful Laws of
England allow a person after a pardon for the infamy of perjury, to be a wit|ness,
reserving his credibility to the Jury, and who may after the former crime
obtain to be belived by them, when they shall have found that he hath ac|quired
an habit of virtue by the series of many actions in his following Life,
no man being supposed able in a desultory way to leap out of a rooted habit of
Vice into an heroical habit of Vertue, and so  contra; for that nature doth
not pass from one extreme to another, but per medium. 'Tis true indeed, in
case of Treason where the life of both the King and Kingdom is struck at, and
of which there is rarely any detection made but by participants in the Crime,
one who would be repell'd from being a Witness, is welcome as an accuser, and
the barking of a dog is allowed to alarm us of thiefs; and as we say against
Pirates, omnis homo miles est, much more may every man be an accuser against
Traitors. Thus I have heard that in the case of heresie in the which (as I said
before) the Canon Law orders the same proceedings and rules as in Treason,
a Lay-man is allowed to be a competent accuser of a Clergy man: And as by
all Laws any man is allow'd to be an accuser who prosecutes an injury done to
himself or his Kindred, so I am told, that by the Canonists Haereticum accusans
dicitur suam suorumque injuriam prosequi (and in that case a notorious enemy
is allowed to be an accuser) for that a heretick is said to strike at the Foundation
of all Lawes divine and humane. Nay according to the Canonists, the Pope
who cannot be accused of any crime but heresie, may be accused of that, and
even by a heretick, and that with good reason according to their hypothesis;
for that the Pope being a Bankrupt in the Faith by heresie, attempts to break
all the innumerable Priests, Monks, Friers, Nunnes, c. that get their
bread by that Religion. No wonder therefore that the Canonists agree that
heresie is to be cut off in the beginning; and they cite out of Timothy, that it
doth eat as a Cancer, and the eating of heresie even in the breast of a Pope
must needs be troublesom to the whole body of Clerical and Monastical Papa|cy,
as a Cancer or Wolfe that would eat up all their bread, and therefore
in the single case of heresie the Pope himself according to his own law may
be convicted by two Witnesses, and be thereupon deposed. But tho it may
be supposed that as the Civil and Canon Laws do leave the credibility of
witnesses very much to the Judges, so our common Law does to Juries, and
that in many actrocious Criminal causes, every man is not allowed to be an
accuser of an illustrious person, and that we ought to be very tender and re|served
in the taking up an ill report against the meanest of any of our Neigh|bours
of mankind; yet its otherwise as I said before in the case of Treason,
which is like a pestilence walking in the dark, and seldom known before tis in|curable,
and before 'tis ploughing up the whole Land of a Country into
graves. We are not to quarrel with the birds of the Air who tell who in
his Bed-Chamber curses the King, because they are not Eagles. We are to

be glad of the happy Augury, and to thank God and them for their saving the
Imperial Eagle; and to be well pleased with either Tame or Wild-geese that
save our Capital. If any Fleet comes to invade us, we are not to be very
nice in diffecting the Morals or outward estate of him who fired the Beacon.
Your Lordship hath heard how Owen o Conally an obscure person (as Sir. Iohn
Temple styles him in his History of the Irish Rebellion) came to the Lord Iu|stice
Parsons about nine of the Clock at Night before the intended seising of Dub|lin
Castle, that was to be on the following day and discovered the detestable Con|spiracy
to him, with the names of the chief Conspirators, when the disguise of wine
had made him seem hardly intelligible or credible. And when it falls out that
a Country is faved by wholesale through a detection of Conspiracies presented
by persons who cheated their Country-men formerly by retail, that is, by per|sons
who had been vile and infamous, it ought to be accounted as an instance of
the divine benignity to some of the most wretched and sinful Members of Man|kind,
who have been long industrious in tearing out of their hearts what re|liques
they could there find of the divine image, and who had long acted on|ly
Devils parts on the Stage of the world in punishing and being punished,
then to invite them to an opportunity of changing the Name of Malefactors
into that of being blessings to the World, and not only of being their Countries
benefactors but (as it were) founders, and to gain good Consciences, and good
names, and what rarely happens to others to have an after-game allowed
them to play for Reputation, and to have it said of such an one on the occasion
of the shame of his past life stimulating him to bring both glory and safety to
his Country, si non errasset fecerat ille minus. By the account that I had sent
to me from London of Matters in some affidavits relating to your being cal|led
Papist, your Lordship hath the greatest advantage that any man can de|sire
who has any things sworn against him, by persons how credible soever,
namely the incredibility of the things themselves. For can it be thought
that your Lordship would out of your own Mouth judge your self a Traitor,
that is, one reconciled to the Church of Rome, and forfeit your Life and
Estate, and attaint your blood in the presence of a young man you had never
seen before? and is it likely that the Irish Papists, who, as Sir Iohn Temple
observes in his said history, have such a kind of dull and deep reservedness, as
makes them with much silence and secresie to carry on their business, and whereby
the design of the last Rebellion which was so generally at the same time and at so
many several places to be acted (and therefore necessarily known to so many seve|ral
persons) was without any Noise brought to such maturity, as to arrive at the
very point of Execution, without any notice or intimation given to any two of
that huge Multitude of persons who were generally designed (as most of them did)
to perish in it; And the Irish Papists having been then (as he saith) tongue-tyed
by an oath of Secresie, I say is it likely that they now designing Mischief if
they did hope by your Lordships help to promote it, that they would trumpet
forth your Lordships name in their publick Masses, and use such speaking
trumpets about your name and their enterprise as should be heard all over
Ireland and England? And who can believe it to have the shadow of Veri-similitude
that your Lordship should give Commission to any to offer one of
the Kings witnesses (and particularly Mr. Dugdale) your house as an Asylum to
retreat to after they had for the turpitude of lucre retreated from their Princi|ples,
their Consciences, their Oathes? I never see any man sworn as a Witness
in a cause, but I think of the saying of St. Austin upon those words of St. Iames,
Above all things my Brethren swear not, Namely Falsa Iuratio exitiosa est, vera
Iuratio periculosa est, Nulla Iuratio secura est; and I have as it were a little
cold shivering on me, while I see a man about what he knoweth of the pro|perty
of a tenement staking his title to a Heaven and a Crown of Glory; I have

then such a concern for another, as I have when I see a great Ship just
launching off the Land into the water, and do then apprehend an immortal
Soul launching it self into the great Ocean of Eternity, and am afraid of its
being overset. But when I think of a mans having honestly sworn already
and in the greatest concern, namely in the detection of a Conspiracy against
his Kings Crown and Life, and consequently having invoked the Omnipo|tent
God to be conditionally his Revenger, his Executioner as well as Judge,
and further think of any one that shall tamper with such a witness and offer
him a great Sum of money as his viatical expences to hell to swear contrary
to his former oath, and by that New Oath to renounce his expectation of a
Crown of Glory in Heaven, and to endanger his Princes Crown and Life on
Earth, and to attempt a Mortal wound on Gods Vice-Roy in the dominions of
his Soul, I mean his Conscience, I have both all possible horror overwhelming
my thoughts on such a tremendous instance of the degeneration of Mans Na|ture,
and I have all the compassion imaginable for your Lordship on one of Man|kindes
pretending to think it possible that your house should with your
consent be turned into a denn for such a Monster.
An Areopagite was discharged from the Seat of Judicature, because he
threw away from him a small bird that fled to him from the pursuit of a great
one; and it was therefore supposed that such a judge alwaies carried cruelty
in his breast for that charissimum Deo animal call'd Man: and such is the com|passionate
tenderness of your Lordships mind toward injured and persecuted
Mankind, that one of those may be allowed to Nest within your house as
freely as a poor bird without it, But birds of Prey, I mean Romes Vultures,
and either suborners or witnesses suborned to recant, have no plea for your
Shelter; and I am confident rather then your house should be a cage for any
such unclean birds, you would be content as the expressions of the Prophet are,
that the Satyr should there cry to his fellow, and that the Schrich Owle should rest
there, and that the wild Breasts of the Desert should also meet there. Your
Lordship sees what a preferment the Papists designed you: for that after (ac|cording
to some of the Narratives of the Plot) Sir W. G. was designed Lord
Privy-Seal, you were to be a providore for a suborned cast witness, and a Iack|al
or provider for the roaring Lion that walks about seeking whom he may de|vour:
In fine, my Lord, they designed your Lordship to be an entertainer
or an Host for the Devil. But your Lordships name being taken in vain by
those who would have retained Mr. Dugdale to take Gods so, and the Devils
tempting any to undertake for your house being a Sanctuary to a devil, are
not new things for wonder, when you please to consider that the Devil
presumed to undertake for Almighty Gods protection, when he tempted the
Son of God. It seems the shewing to Dugdale the several Kingdoms of the
Earth where he should be safe, could not prevail with him to be a fugitive
from his Conscience; and tho it appeared in several Trials, and particularly
my Lord Staffords, the temper desired to have him, and that he was sifted,
winnowed as wheat, Yet neither his Faith nor the faith of his Testimony fai|led
him, after all the cribration thereof, and all that was gained by the endea|vour'd
suborning him against himself, as well as others against him, was only
the fate of the Thrush, who is sometime birdlimed and took by his own ex|crements.
Is it not then an example of rare modesty, that the diabolical tempters
should be the accusers of the Brethren, I mean of some of the Kings witnesses
that would not be Bribed from attesting the truth in the case of their Politi|cal
Father? The Age wants not the instance of an honorable Person, who
courting a Lady in order to marriage, thought her at last not worthy his
farther amours, yet who because he did once profess to love her, he fought

one who reproach'd her vertue: But his example is not more herocial than
is the practice infamous, for such who courted some of the Kings Witnesses
both by importunity and gold to espouse their interest, and when both were
totally and finally rejected, make it the the most study'd part of the Romance of
their Lives to dishonour them, and to shamme inventions of New Tragi|comic
Plotts upon them, but Plots so damn'd dull, as to be seen through in
the opening of the first Act, and Plots that were most thin where the Actors
cryed to themselves like Bayes in the Rehersal, Now the Plot thickens, and
where nothing of the three Vnities was regarded, and which no marvel if
they brought such confusion still to the Actors, as the Story makes to have
once happen'd to the old Red-Bull Players at the Tragedy of Doctor Faustus,
when they complained that they had one Devil more than their Company, and
when they said a quarter of the house was carried away. Your Lordship out
of a generous indignation that such Whifflers in Politics should think to lay
a tax upon the belief of the Kingdom both without Act of Parliament, and
without Sense (and indeed contrary to the sense of several Parliaments) did
during a Paroxysme of the Gout, cause your self to be carried by your Servants
to be present at Councel, when the Papists pretended Presbyterian-Plot was
there to be considered. And if it be true what Mr. Hobbs saith in his inge|nious
History of the Civil Wars of England, [That Monsieur du Plessis and
Dr. Morton Bishop of Durham writing of the progress of the Popes power, and
entitling their Books, one of them, The Mystery of Iniquity, the other, The
Grand Imposture, were both in the Right; for I believe there was never such
another Cheat in the World] the Mercury of that cheat being sublimated into
the invented cheat of that Plot, was too nauseous and strong for the belief
of the Kingdom to be able to swallow. We may therefore be very well allow'd
to put the old great interrogtory of Cicero to these Catilines, How long do
you abuse our patience? especially considering how much to windward we are
of them by the detection of their real Treason, and do see both the smoke of
our gunns, and those of their own they fire at us annoying them, and while
we have had the just advantage of Plaintiffs against them and whereby their
recrimination against some of our great number has seemed only dirt thrown
in their own defence, and at worst but Catilines accusing of Cethegus, and
considering that we know it only proper to he Religion to justifie the
Maintaining the dignity of holy Church by Lies and calumnies. Thus Guyme|nius
a famous Popish Doctor ex tractatu de Charitate Proposit. 7. p. 176. cites
Bannez. 2. 2. quaest. 70. art. 3. dub. 2. for asserting that per modum defensae 
ad infringendam contumeliosi authoritatem, potest secundum quosdam absque lethali
crimen falsum illi objici, and that 'tis only a venial Sin to object a false crime to
an unjust witness, and twenty Doctors are there mentioned for the making this
a probable opinion. And therefore if it be lawful for a man to make shamm-accusations
where he hath only a private concern, 'tis meritorious to do it in
the case of holy Church: therefore he said very right according to the Popish
hypothesis, gaudeo sve per veritatem sive per occasionem Romanae ecclesiae digni|tatem
extolli. Ioseph. Stephanus de Osc. pr. in epist. ad lect.
Guymenius p. 190. extactatu de justitia  Iure, Propositio. 1. Cites both Fa|thers
Schoolmen Divines and Casuists of several orders, and even holy Scripture
for the asserting this proposition, viz. Licitum est clerico vel religioso, Calumniato|rem
gravia crimina, de se vel de sua Religione spargere minantem occidere, quando
alius defendendi modus non suppetit: A principle of Religion calculated only for
Ballies Hectors,  therefore no marvel that such were observed to flock from
so many parts of most Countries in England to London in and since the year
1678. like Ravens in expectation of the Carcases of Protestants, and such
miscreants are to the Jesuits their Triarian bands upon occasion, and who in

the Out skirts of London are a noysome Pestilence, and not enduring nor be|ing
endured to live in the Countrey.
But from the said last Cited proposition of Guymenius, the proposition that
contained the enacting Law Sir Edmund Godfrey fell by, I infer, that since
there is a par or proportion between a good name and life, that such who ac|count
it lawful for a particular Clergy-man to Murder even a Popish Lay|man
who shall but threaten to caluminate him, will account it meritorious
by Shammes to Murder the fames of those who shall threaten to accuse holy
Church.
And it seems as men try experiments on Creatures they account vile, they
experimented both these propositions on Godfrey, for after they had basely kil|led
him, they would have shammed off his blood and the guilt of it upon himself,
when they pierced his dead body with his own Sword; a barbarous and in|famous
sort of cruelty and which brings to my mind what Dr. Donne in the
preface to his  referres to in the Notae Mallon. in Paleot. Part.
1. cap. 2. viz. that the Church in her Hymnes and Antiphones doth often salute
the Nayles and Cross, but the Spear which pierced Christ when he was dead, it
ever calles dirum mucronem. And here because some of them drive an eternal
trade of butchering and shamming, and then in effect Stabbing their own
Shamms of Plots, I shall Entertain your Lordship with one egregious instance of
a Priest of theirs being abandon'd to a reprobate or injudicious sence of shamming,
in making by a ridiculous Lye a famous Cardinal and profound States-man
perhaps as the World has bred, and one of singular Piety and great modesty,
to render the Gun-Powder-Treason a Sham Plot, and thereby wounding the
Fame of both the understanding and morals of their great dead Church
Hero, as barbarously as they did the Corps of Godfry. And this instance I
refer to, is in a Book called The Advocate of Conscience liberty, or an Apology for
Toleration rightly stated, and writ with Learning and Wit, and Artifice enough
ad faciendum populum by a Priest of Romes Church an English man, and printed
in the year 1673. In pag. 325. He represents the Gunpowder-Treason to be a
Sham Plot contrived by Cecil, and to prove this, Cites D'Ossats Letters,
Book 2d. Letter 43. And the date of that Letter was from Rome, March the
29. 1596. And the date of the last Letter there is from Rome in December
that year. The Gunpowder-Treason Plot was to have been on the 5th of
November 1605. And on D'Ossats marble Tomb in Rome his Epitaph men|tions
that he dyed Anno 1604. so then he is made by that Author to have
known that Treason to have been a Sham-Plot Eight years before it was to be
executed, and to have permitted many Papists for want of his sending a line
of News of the Shamm, to be shamm'd out of their lives, and the Roman Church
to be shammed and anniversaried out of its credit in England.
But if they reproach any as they did Cecil on the pretence of the persua|ding
some of their wild principles into the decoy of a plot, a thing I think de|testable
as what implies a tempting or inviting of a Man to degenerate from
himself, they have no reason to be angry with but only to pitty men that re|ceive
infection from their principles, and from this particular one, That 'tis
lawful for a good end to ensnare men into acts of Sin. Many Casuists and Di|vines
are brought by Guymenius for this purpose, p. 184. in the 9th proposition
ex tractatu de Charitate, and under which proposition he quotes Sotus de Sec.
memb. 2. quaest. 2. a little before the fifth conclusion where he enquires, an li|ceat
 expediat aliquando perditum hominem permittere in pejora prolabi crimi|na,
ut ignomini peccatorum confusus, facilius resipiscat  emendetur. And he an|swers
licet nobis aliquando permittere peccatorem ad tempus in pejus cadere ut
cautius resurgat.

The 9th proposition there is Maritus qui uxorem adulteram suspicatur potest e
occasionem offerre ut in adulterio deprehensam corrigat. Lay man. Iesuita. lib. 2.
tract. 3. Cap. 13. num. 5.
But in p. 205. extractatu de justitia  Iure; Propositio 4. The correction
that may be lawfully used is assigned, it being there said, that non peccat mari|tus
occidens propria authoritate uxorem in adulterio deprehensam: the which he
saith Sa the Iesuit represents as a probable opinion, And which Hurtado he saith
positively defends, Tom. 1. resol. moral. tr. ulti. res. 5. . 7. n. 204. so that if a
Protestant States-man had inveigled them into a plot and then hang'd them
for it, his politicks had squared exactly with their Morals. And even as the
calling of a Rat-catcher is a lawful calling, tho some of that profession have
had no certain way to take Rats but by the use of one experiment, namely,
first, to provoke them to fly in the Artists face; according to the said
principles is the calling of a States-man both lawful and laudable who deals so
with such as he judgeth to nibble at Treason. But this by the way. And
now to let your Lordship see how some of their Divinity is particularly but a
laboured Sham in the case of Treason, and even but a mocking at Sin, I shall di|vert
you with a known Author among them making men play with the bait
of Regicide, as he is hooking them into it: And 'tis Mariana the Iesuit, as I
find him Cited by Dr. Donne in his forementioned book p. 135. He quotes
there Mariana de Rege l. 1. c. 7. for cautioning against a King being a self-homi|cide
by drinking poyson prepared and ministred by another he being ignorant; for
after he concluded how an heretical King may be poisoned he is diligent in this pre|scription.
[That a King be not constrained to take the poison himself, but that some other
may administer it to him, and that therefore it be prepared and conveyed in some
other way than meat and drink; because else, saith he, either willingly or igno|rantly
he shall kill himself] so that he provides that the King who must dye un|der
the Sins of Tyranny and heresie; must yet be defended from concurring to his
own death; tho ignorantly, as tho this were a greater Sin.
Is not this pleasant to see any of them catching of Kings in a Theological
Mousetrap, and playing with them like Mice before they devour them? to
see them sweeten a Cup of poyson for a King with their damn'd Church
Sophistry, and to sham men as licorish Flies to be Swallowed up in the
Cup? I wish that some of the most considerable of the Grandees of the
Church of Rome could Answer this accusation of their shamming, otherwise than
by committing it de novo: for if they say that some of their Doctors write
against this and other crimes as well as some for them, as particularly some
write against the use of equivocation; And as Father Parsons the Jesuite
writing against King Iames's succession, another English Jesuite namely Cres|wel
writ for it, and so that when some of their Doctors break the Churches
head, others presently gave it Plaisters, is not this a fearful, shall I say, or
Contemptible sham? Do we not know that the discipline of their Church is
as exact as any Military discipline can be, by which alone it hath preserved it
self so long in being, and that none among them can publish books without
passing several Courts of Guards of Superiors, nor contradict one another in
rules of practice, more than Trumpeters of an Army dare sound a charge or
a retreat but when commanded to it? And what a face of something like
sham the present Popes declaration about some opinions of the Casuists car|ries
with it, I have already mentioned; and doth not every one know their
avowed doctrine de opinione probabili, Namely, that tho an opinion be false, a
man may with a safe conscience follow it by reason of the Authority of the
teacher, and that a Confessor is bound to absolve the penitent when there is but
one opinion for his being absolved, tho, he believes that opinion not only im|probable
as to the principia intrinseca, but false.

In Sum, according to the old observation of Poperies prevailing, by have|ing
that in it which may fit the temper and humor of every individual per|son,
and to be like Manna answering every mans tast, whether he hath a gusto
for miracles, or even for starving or abstinence, for business, or retirement
for Life or for death, for Honor or for begging, it may to these be added, that
if any one affects to be a Ruffian or one of the Popes Sheriffs as aforesaid, there
is a most ample field in the killing of Kings, firing of Towns, Massacring their
Inhabitants for the talent of such a Pavure diable, and indeed incarnate one to
expatiate in, and if any account it a luscious thing to be cheated or to be sham|med
as some few, or to cheat or sham as many think it, behold a Religion made
for the nonce in that point too. But while they are thus playing with all
things Sacred and profane, he that sits in the heavens has them in derision and
leaves not the Protestants to fall finally as a portion to Foxes, such who turned
tail to tail carry firebrands between them, and their shammes do only enter on
the Stage of the World to be instantly hissed off.
My Lord, I have not been rash in Censuring either the principles or practi|ces
of some Roman Catholicks as aforesaid. And particularly I well know,
that even the most ingenious of our English Papists cannot now in this Con|juncture
endure to hear of Father Parsons his book writ by him to Invalidate the
Right of King Iames to succeed Queen Elizabeth, principally because he was (as
Father Parsons thought) an heretick. A very great Man that Iesuite was, and
so Considerable, that one of our eminent Divines in his Sermon in print, gives
him this Character; That he was perhaps one of the greatest men that the order
of the Iesuits has produced.
And methinks 'twas pitty he should play at such small game of sham, when
he publisht that book, as to entitle it to Doleman, an honest secular Priest whom
Parsons hated, and to make him odious, laid the brat at his door.
Moreover, a kind of inglorious sham it was, that Creswel, who was Par|sons
his fellow Iesuite, writ (as I said) at the same time for King Iames his
Right to the Crown, not out of any desire he should enjoy that Right, but that
on all events they might have something to say in apology for their Society,
and bring Grist to its mill. For if King Iames had not come to the Crown
of England, the honour of hindring his Succession had been attributed to Par|sons;
and Creswel the Jesuit expected the Credit for his writing on the Event
falling as it did. Thus I remember to have heard a Passage of two Astrolo|gers,
who on the day before the former great Prince of Parma was to throw
the die of War, agreed together to predict luck to him perfectly contrary to
one another, that so they might save the credit of their art, by one of the
artists being in the Right.
The Author of the book called the Catholick Apology, with a Reply c. (and
which book I think the Author of the Compendium mentions as one of the books
writ by the Roman Catholicks of England since the Kings Restoration) saith p.
366. speaking of Dolemans book, For Dolemans book who wrote it God knows,
Parsons deny'd it at his death, and I believe he was not the author, because in
several of his works he speaks very much to the advantage of King Iames. But
as to Father Parsons having in that Conjuncture been of the Spanish faction, and
having apply'd his whole soul and strength to hinder King Iames's Succession,
and his having writ that book the Great foremention'd Cardinal, namely
D'Ossat, (who in several of his Printed Letters gives the World a more satis|factory
and particular Scheme of the whole design to hinder that Kings Suc|cession
to the Crown of England, than I know any or all else to have done)
saith among his letters (printed in folio at Paris 1664.) in that in book 7th
Anno 1601. a letter to the King, letter 131. what may be thus render'd in
English, viz. It may please your Majesty to remember, that since the year 1594.

there was a book printed in the English language that the Spaniards caus'd to be
made by an English Iesuite call'd Parsons, and 'twas by the way of the low Coun|try
dispersed about England c. And further in the 7th book p. 301. in the
letter to Villeroy, letter 133. what he saith of that book of Parsons, may be
thus made English, and from that book of Father Parsons one might draw rea|sons
in favour of his Majesty, which would be more weighty then those he deduceth
for the King of Spain and his Sister, the said Father Parsons does contradict
himself very often and very grosly, as it happens to all persons in passion as able as
they are, who are not guided by truth and by reason, but transported by Interest
and by passion. And in the last letter of the 8th book, and to Villeroy from
Rome the 30th of December 1602, he speaks of Father Parsons having made
application to himself to desire that there might be a treaty prepared from Rome
between the Pope, the King of France, and the King of Spain, to agree among
themselves of a Catholick, that may Reign in England after the Queen, be it
the King of Scots if he will turn Catholick, or be it some one else c. But there
in p. 367, year 1603, letter 174. from Rome to Villeroy, and on April 21st,
it appears that all the Machinations of the hot Iesuitical heads against King
Iames his Succession were overturn'd by providence, for he there saith that the
Queen was no sooner dead, then that the King of Scotland was in England
peaceably received, and the Controversie of King Iames his title evaporated;
and for the honour of our English understandings he there saith, Les gens de
cet Isle l ont bien Monstr qu' ils scavoient faire leurs affaires entr' eux tost 
seurement,  que ceux de dehors se sont fort mescontez en leurs desseins  espe|rances.
i. e. the people of England have well shewn that they knew how to do
their own business among themselves quickly and safely, and that others abroad
took very wrong Measures in their designs and hopes.
I have here said enough to entertain your Lordship with the View of their
unreasonableness, who would impose on us, That Father Parsons wrote
not that Impious and Treasonable Book, and likewise with the more pleasant
View of Gods Confuting it (as I may say) by the happy determination of his
over-ruling Providence.
And Now because I would make it appear to your Lordship, that I have
not been unjustly severe to the Jesuitical Principles, in rendring them such as
are the sturdy extravagances of those offals of Mankind, call'd Bullyes and
Hectors, I shall entertain you with one Instance of a Bravado of threatning
from one English Iesuite to all Protestant Crown'd Heads, a bravado that is
like the High Water Mark, to shew in words how high 'tis possible for the
foam of the raging Sea of Anger to reach, and 'tis in a Letter of Campian the
Iesuite to Queen Elizabeths Privy Councellers, printed afterwards at Triers,
1583. as I find it Cited in that most learned Preface of my Lord Bishop of
Lincoln's to the Book concerning the Gunpowder Treason, in the Year 1679,
and 'tis thus in English, viz. That all the Iesuits throughout the World have
long since enter'd into a Covenant, to kill heretical Kings any manner of way:
and as to our Society know, That we Iesuites who are spread far and wide throughout
the whole World, have enter'd into an holy Covenant, that we shall easily over|come
all your machinations, and that we shall never despair of it as long as any
one of us remains in the World. Lo here a Drawcansir, that will not only snub all
Protestant Kings, and take the bowles from their mouths, and beat out their
Brains with them himself, but he saith there is a Society or Corporation of
such brethren of the bladed Ecclesiastical, who have enter'd into a Covenant or
Association to murder all Protestant Kings, and that every single Member of
the Corporation should have that dead-doing talent of Valour that should awe
and subjugate the Protestant World. And here then, my Lord, every Jesuite
values himself on being a Mutius Scaevola; and more than Three hundred of

these new Romans, or so many thousands of them, I mean all of them, ac|cording
to Campian, have Covenanted to destroy every Porsenna that lays siege
to Rome: but in that time of Queen Elizabeth there was an industrious Gentle|man
who fear'd not the terror of these Huffes, but with his secrecy and silence
did reduce these mad dogs into the Condition of neither barking nor biting
in England, I mean Sir Francis Walsingham, of whom 'tis said in Cotton's
Posthuma, That his bountifull hand made his intelligences so active, that a Se|minary
could scarcely stir out of the Gates of Rome without his privity. And
no wonder then if Campian was soon brought to the end of a Traytor here in
England by the Care of one of Queen Elizabeths Privy Councellers in the Year
1581. who did both defie and scorn that Rhodomantado address, wherein the
Iesuite did Goliah-like, defie All Protestant Kings and their Armies, and as if
he would give their flesh to the Fowls of the ayr; but the event shew'd his own
flesh was so given as a Traytors, to that use here in England.
It was a kind of a bravado in the great Archimedes, to say, Give me where
to stand, and I'le shake the Earth. He well knew no such place could be found.
The Iesuits it seems would have every one of their Order to be an Archimedes,
and able to shake the Earth as he pleas'd, and the hypothesis of Popery they
know offers them a place divided from the Civil and Imperial Government
where to stand with their Engines, namely the Ecclesiastical, but things will
not be ill administred, and holy Church it self will sink into the Earth, if its
Foundation be not laid as God and Nature would have it, and the Man who
stands for the place to be an Archimedes, and to Move the Earth, will soon
find his fate of being dissolv'd into his own little dust, and that among the
artificial lines he is making. It seems that boasted association or Covenant of
the Jesuites did help to occasion another among the Protestants in Queen
Elizabeths time, which was ratify'd by Act of Parliament in the 27th of Eliz.
which was about three years after the death of Campian, who was Convicted
of High Treason by vertue of the Statute made in the time of our Popish An|cestors,
namely in the 25 of Edward the Third, and thereupon executed, and
yet by the Romish Church made a Martyr, tho (as I said) convicted on that
Statute. But according to this thundring denuntiation of War against all he|retical
Kings by Campian as the Jesuites Herald, and his boasting when he did
put on his armour that every one of his Order should be like an Alexander an
adequate match for at least one World of hereticks, the author of the Compen|dium
needed not by his Rhetorick to reflect on my Lord Bishop of Lincoln's
Candour  gentleness in saying yet if it be a breach of Christianity to crush the
bruised reed and of generosity also to trample upon the oppressed, I wish his Lordship
may be found guilty of neither c. for behold any single Jesuite according to
Campian tho but like a reed shaken with the wind is able to bruise all Protestant
Scepters, and any little toe of that Order can trample all Heretical crowned
heads to dirt, and the Number of the Papists in England if reduced to the least
of Numbers is not according to Campian to be slighted, if one of them be a
Iesuite, for that that one Jesuite will carry the advantage of odds against all
Protestant Kings and Princes; that one may say my Name is legion, for we are
many: but as that legion-spirit could not without the Divine permission ruin
a herd of Swine off from a Steep place, so neither can all the legions of Iesuited
evil Spirits in the World drive a King  Kingdom from Precipices at their plea|sure:
And Queen Elizabeth in spight of all the arts and power of Rome outlived
eight Popes, and lived to change all her Counsellors but one, all her great offi|cers
twice or thrice, some Bishops four times, and died full of years, and did see
and leave peace upon Israel.
And now I shall Entertain your Lordship with a further Reason of my
charging the present Popes declaration aforesaid about some opinions of the

Casuists, as carry with it a face of some thing like shamme: and my reason
is grounded on what was said in a publick Sermon before an honourable Au|dience,
namely, that the propositions of the Casuists therein were not Condemned
by the Pope in the Consistory, which would have made the Censure more authorita|tive,
but by the Pope and Cardinals of the Court of the Inquisition, upon which a
remarkable thing follow'd: the Iefuites in France who were much provoked at this
Censure, moved the Procureur de Roy, or Attorney general at Paris to put in a Com|plaint
against the publishing that Decree, since it came from the Court of the In|quisition,
which not being acknowledg'd in France, nothing Flowing from that au|thority
could be received in that Kingdom: upon which the decree was prohibit|ed
and suppress'd.
And may not the English Popish Priests say the same thing, the Inquisition
was never received in England, and therefore that declaration of the Popes
obligeth us not here, and we will prohibit and suppress it as much as we can!
No doubt but the present Pope fearing that the Noysome and Infectious smell
of those Opinions of the Casuists being more offensive to the minds of Men,
then any snuff of a Candle can be to their Nostrils, they were ready to cry
for the removing of the Candlestick of his Church out of its place, went about
to extinguish them in the most Summary Manner that he could, and there|fore
attempted to do it by the Court of the Inquisition; well knowing, that in
the Consistory of Cardinals all proceedings are so dilatory, and the old magi
there so used to do every thing pian piano, that they would consume many
pounds of new Candles in debating whether or no and how the old snuff should
be removed, and perhaps would have thought to have contented the World in
the mean time with giving it some perfumes: but the Pope being afraid of the
Iesuites, perhaps as sometimes the Grand Signior is of his Ianisaries, doth not
for fear himself should be extinguished by them, so far (as I may say) follow the
light within him, as to throw away or tread out that snuff of those opinions as
containing a malum in se, or declare any of them to be ill as contrary to the
principles of the law of nature, in which case neither he nor God himself indeed
could have dispens'd with them, tho yet any honest and ingenious Heathen
would on the least occasion given, have declared them so, As Cicero and Sene|ca,
and many others have done; and which had the Pope done and the Ie|suites
or any Papists persevered in the making those principles the Rules of
practice, his Kingdom had thereby been ipso facto divided against it self, and a
diffinitive sentence had been thereby given by the Pope, that all who had dy'd
owning those principles and practices, had been sunk for ever into the burning
lake. Therefore, as I said before, I hope this declaration of the Popes such as it
is, will give an alarm to our English Papists to deal seriously with their Souls,
and to consider as if it were for their eternities, these and other Principles of
their Religion, and that if they will not be thereby perswaded to be almost Pro|testant
Christians, yet to be altogether Masters of as good Moral Principles as
the Heathens I named; and If any of them can but give us a Moral certainty
of their Principles being but such, I shall never repine at any favour that any
new Law may afford to such of them.
If therefore any of our Lay Country men Papists not guilty of the late
Plot shall desire to be heard, and to say any thing toward this effect, some of us
have heard of these principles before mention'd as own'd by our Casuists and Priests
and Confessors, that are now thus condemned by the Pope, and we did not believe
that those our spiritual guides did own such Principles, but now our Eye seeth by the
condemnation thereof that they were before own'd and made rules of Practice;
Wherefore we hope that who ever do own them, will abhor themselves and repent in
dust and ashes; and others of us did formerly think them Consistent with the
Christian faith and the peace of Kingdoms and with humane Society, but we now

abhor those principles and repent in dust and ashes; We are ready to let the King
and Kingdom and the World have a moral certainty, that we desire no power to
change the Religion in England by Law establish'd, and we are willing to receive
Instruction from any that shall be appointed by publick Authority, to give it to us,
concerning what other principles beside these Condemned by the Pope are inconsi|stent
with Religion or the publick Peace; and in case any shall offer to give us dispen|sations
either for principles or practices contrary to those, we renounce as inconsi|stent
with the publick peace; we shall be so far from accepting of such dispensa|tion,
that we shall detect the offerer thereof before a Magistrate, as much as we
would an enemy to His Majesty; We are ready to give active or passive obedience
as to all the Laws in being; We believe not the Bishop of Rome to have more
power in His Majesties Realms by Gods word, then any other forraign Bishop, as
was by Acts of Parliament and publick Recognitions declared in the Reign of
Henry the 8th. We are willing to render the Kingdom as secure from fear of us
and our obtaining power, as are the States of the Vnited Provinces from those of
our persuasion in Religion among them; We are willing to let you see, that the same
Basis that shall be your security, shall likewise be ours.
A great part of our number has we fear given too much cause of jealousie to the
Kingdom of their affecting pre-eminence therein, we are sorry for it, and hope it
will be so no more;
I say such Papists as these are the bruised reeds, I would not trample on, and
would make no noise to interrupt their being heard to the effect above men|tion'd.
And since what has been done, may be, and Sir William Temple in his
Impartial Observations on the Vnited Provinces of the Netherlands, chap. 5. saith
of the Roman Catholicks there, that tho they are very numerous in the Country
among the Pesants, and considerable in the Cities, yet they seem to be a sound piece
of the State, and fast jointed in with the rest: and have neither given any distur|bance
to the Government, Nor expres'd any inclinations to a Change, or to any
forreign power, either upon the former Wars with Spain, or the latter Invasions of
the Bishop of Munster; 'tis I say possible therefore for them to become sound
pieces of the state there. And if the end of all their shamme Plots be what is
usually that of Comedies, and Romances plots, a Marriage, I mean their espou|sing
the true Interest of the Kingdom, I for my part shall never forbid the bannes
of the Matrimony, nor enter any Caveat against the license for it granted by
lawful authority; provided they give due security as in that case against such
a precontract with Rome, that may null their contract with us.
'Tis an old Common Observation, That whelps without any care bestowed
on them will see at the end of nine days, tho born blind, and that if they are
much tamper'd with by art to be forced to see sooner, they are blind for ever:
and therefore I hope that the forbearance of our Church in this latter Age to
tamper with them, by disputes, or Catechising, or Compelling them to be
present at the publick worship, will with the help of Time and Nature, and
their experience of their inability by all their shamme Plots to put out our
Eyes, conduce to the opening of theirs.
Alas, what advantage is it by all their artifices that they can hope both to
gain and keep here, I mean for any considerable time. A trick of art is like
a Monster in Nature, ill-lookt, and short lifed; and 'tis obvious to every
Eye, that the higher Scale got up by accident, is more ready to pop down again,
then it was before, while it hung in its due poise. And while they do by
art and contrary to Nature in any Conjuncture hoist up their Interest high in
the Air, the artificial motion endures not there long to be gazed at, and
while it is there visible, 'tis beheld by thousands of vigilant Marksmen, who
know 'tis easier to hit the mark shooting upward then downward.

We find 'tis notorious out of the present Pope's said Decree of the Second
of March last, That the Iesuits and other Casuists were Encouragers and Pa|trons
of Calumny, by those Principles of theirs he therein Condemns, and
namely, That Probabile est non peccare mortaliter qui imponit falsum crimen al|teri,
ut suam justitiam  honorem defendat:  si hoc non sit probabile, vix ulla
erit opinio probabilis in Theologia: i. e. It is probable that he doth not Sin Mor|tally,
who fastens a false Crime on another, that he may defend his own Iustice
and Honour; and if this is not probable, there is scarce any Opinion probable
in Divinity.
The Iesuits have by this Opinion given us the alarm that they make Ca|lumny
not contrary to the Law of God, but only beside it, for that is the Po|pish
account of a Venial Sin; and moreover, that it is a small and very pardo|nable
Offence against God or our Neighbour, and no more than an Idle word, and
that it Robs not the Soul of life, and that it may be remitted without hearty
Pennance and Contrition, and only with the Sacraments, Holy Water, and the
like; these being the Popish Received Doctrines of the Nature of Ve|nial
Sin.
And thus they may be false Imputations and Testimonies rob the Bodies
of Protestants of life, without bereaving their own Souls thereof, and this is
own'd by them as a first Rate probable Opinion in that Great Science call'd
Divinity, that Great first Rate of all Sciences, as relating to the honour of
God; but most certainly we have very great Reason to pity the Persons of
those who have such low and groveling and ridiculous Conceptions of the
Supreme Being, as to think to add any thing to the brightness of his Perfe|ction
by that Sacrifice with whose smoke they endeavour to blind the eyes of
some of their Brethren; while they are with its flames consuming the Bodies
of others, and to think to tickle him with the straw of Praise, while they
rob Men, and that the using of Fraud can be worthy of God, which is scorn'd
not only by Gentlemen, but even generous Beasts (it being proper to Foxes,
and not to Lions to practise it) and that tho the Dice of the Gods always fall
luckily (according to the old Adage) that false ones are to be used for their
Honour, or that any one is to be a falsarius for the Glory of the true God,
and that since the Roman Heathens thought it Essential to the Justice of
their Laws, and the honour of Human Nature to term him a falsarius who
but conceal'd Truth in the Case of Men, it can be worthy of the Divine Nature
to encourage false asseverations in Ordine ad Deum, and that it can be any
Honour to infinit Wisdom to out-wit silly Mortals, or to infinit Goodness, to set
it self off by the putative or real faults of any one, and that since as the Phi|losopher
said long ago, 'tis the greatest Scandal to a Governor imaginable
, to lay snares for those that he Governs, to think
that the Great Governor of the World can have honour from the laying of Nets
and Springes by Man Catchers; In fine, to think that after the Divine Com|passion
to Men had under the Mosaic Dispensation so long signaliz'd it self
against Idolatry, because 'twas a Cheat, and for that an Idol is nothing, it can
be consistent with the Divine goodness now under the Oeconomy of the Gospel
(of which the Restoring of Humane Nature was the Great intent) to encou|rage
inhumane Arts and Artifices, to make it degenerate to the old Cheat of
Idolatry again, and which was the worst extremity of it, the immolation of
Men under the pretext of Religion, a Cheat of Idolatry, that the Blessed
Iesus design'd by the offring of himself to exterminate out of the World as an
unnecessary thing, and by his dying breath to make it evaporate for ever.
There was no guile found in his mouth, and his followers were only then wise
as Serpents, while they were innocent as Doves: and the first Crying in the
Cradle of the Puer Hebraeus of the holy child Iesus, was as Thunder to

strike the old Equivocating Oracles Dumb, that had so long cheated the cre|dulous
World.
When he branded the Scribes and Pharisees with sharper language, he calls
them Hypocrites; He alarms us of false Prophets coming in the Masquerade
of Sheeps clothing; tells us, That he who calls his Brother fool, shall be in dan|ger
of hell fire, and therefore he may much more fear that danger who
makes a Fool of him, and plays the Knave with him; he Commands us not
to Calumniate or kill, but to bless those that curse us, which is more than to
praise them, as I said before of blessing being the tribute due to Men heroi|cally
Virtuous.
To shew that he intended nothing of Artifice in the Propagation of his
Doctrine, a hated Publican, and a few poor Fishermen, and a Tent-maker
are used in his Embassy to the World, men not likely to be able Mentiri
pro patri coelesti, if such a Commission as Go Cheat all Nations, had been
given them.
And lest it might be thought that with Oratorical Harangues that he or
they led Men by the Ears, as an implicit faith is said to lead them by the Nose,
he us'd no hony of Phrase, or sting of Epigram, no Politic Remarks, nor
scarce more lenocinium of words, than is in He that hath an ear to hear, let
him hear.
He tells us, That for every Idle word we must give an account, and therefore
certainly abhorr'd Equivocation, which makes all words and speech Idle, and
of no effect; and since, as I think, 'twas truly said, Eloquentia non nisi stultos
Movet, Eloquence moves none but Fopps; he did, as I may say, put that gene|rous
Complement on mens understandings, not to Commission his Ministers to
try to sooth men out of one belief into another by bribing their imagi|nations
with the excellency of speech, or the inticing words of man's Wisdom,
but the contrary.
He thought it worthy of God to be worship'd by the world in Spirit and in
Truth, and not to encrease the number of his Homagers by Lies, Legends, and
Impostures. It was for the honour of the Christian Religion that the Son of
God chose to take flesh in the time when Augustus Reign'd, when the Roman
World being freed from a long Civil War, had leisure to ltivate the Arts
of Wit and Reason, and had brought them to their highest Perfection, and
took not the advantage of a dark and barbarous Age to surprize the World in,
as afterward both Papism and Mahumetanism did, and 'tis therefore no Marvel
if either of those two Hypotheses of Religion, did in one Point so much resem|ble
the Christian Religion, in so soon with its ferment levening so Great a
lump of the World.
But the Christian Religion came not into the World like a Fireship with
prepar'd smoke to blind mens eyes, as it was assailing them: No, for to the
end that the Christian reveal'd Doctrine might like a great Pyramid be conspi|cuous
to the whole world, and last together with it, and reach from Earth to
Heaven, the Divine Providence was long laying its Foundation very deep in
Nature, and very wide in the world; I mean, Iustice and Reason so agreeably
to Humane Nature then at their height appearing in the Laws of the Roman
Empire, and its subjugating the World, and its reducing Mankind to the Law
of Nature first imprinted on Man's heart, were by the Care of Heaven used
as previous in qualifying the World to receive the Glorious Superstructure of
the Christian Religion, the which would certainly not have been so much as
res unius aetatis, if at that time when the Roman Laws inculcating the Natural
Cognation between all Mankind, and placing Actions that wound Piety or Repu|tation,
or good Manners in the Number of things Impossible, and intimating
their abhorrence of Collusion, Combining, Circumvention, and Disanulling

things done thereby, and branding of those acts that do fraudem facere legi,
and rendring that to be but a pittiful innocence that is but as good as the Law re|quires,
and making him in the eyes of the Law to be still in Possession of any
thing, who is actually trickt out of it, quia pro possessione dolus est, providing
against Calumny by an Oath in all litigations, and when a person is render'd to
do a thing infamously, expressing it by dolo facit, having the regard of Pu|dor,
verecundia, Humanitatis, ac Religionis ratio, and other such words of
the like charming signification, which were like Trees in the Body of the
Roman Laws, planted as thick by one another as they could well stand, the
Christian Religion had in the Congruity of its Precepts to Humane Nature
come short of those of the Romans, who as Cicero says, did not Calliditate
ac Robore, sed Pietate ac Religione omnes gentes nationes superare, and espe|cially
if in those against Calumny, Fraud and Circumvention, the Christian
Faith had not reach'd as high as the bona fides of the Heathens, and much
more, if the Model of Christian Morality had been in that Knowing Age like
that of the Jesuits in this.
But certainly since it hath often proved fatal to the Ministers of Kings to
be, or seem wiser than their Masters, the Iesuits by affecting in their Plat|forms
of Morality to be wiser than him, who in the style of the Scripture,
of God is made to us Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption, may
easily take a prospect of their ruine; and as the Serpents trying to out-wit
Heaven, and its Poisoning the Morals of our first Parents with its subtlety,
made the Scene of its motion to be in the Dust, and it to be more accurs'd than
any brute Animal, such is likely to be the fate of this Serpentine Order
after they have been by their subtle Casuistical distinctions so long nibbling at
the Sacred word, a thing the old Serpent did, and tempting Men in a fool's
Paradise, according to their several Palates by their Tree of the Knowledge of
Good and Evil, I mean the Experiments of Vice, by their pretended Moral
Theology; but what is so far from deserving the Name of Theology, that if it
were imagin'd that a general Counsel of Devils were by their Chief call'd to
debate of a Model of credenda and agenda for the world, 'tis likely they would
unanimously agree to set up this, and no other; for no doubt they would
pass no Article to deny the existence of a God, for they believe that, and
tremble, nor yet any Article that might be controul'd by Natural light, or
of which any Matter of Fact would be over-rul'd by Authentic History; but
they would among the unwary Judges of things, and such whose Judgments
are choak't up with the fumes of lust, try to puzzle the Cause of Religion,
and by distinctions to make Golden Bridges for Men to retreat from Morali|ty:
And this Course the Iesuits have took. By their Casuistical distinctions
they have broke both the Tables of the Moral Law into innumerable pieces;
they have broke not only the least, but greatest of the Commandments, and
have taught men so to do, and how to do it with a Salvo to them, and how
Salvo metu  fide peccare; and by being Casuistical Splitters of Sin, have
been as troublesome to the World, as Splitters of Causes are to a Country.
The Christian Religion that great Tye intended by Heaven to be like a sub|stantial
and great Cable (as I may say) to supply the great Anchor of our
hope, they have made it their great business to untwist by their nice distin|ctions,
and to make it so fine that it will not hold, and by encouraging Lies
and Calumnies for the honour of Holy Church, they have help'd the
Politic-Atheists-would be to a new occasion of trying to insinuate that old
impotent-Slander that Religion it self is a Cheat; and moreover, since it is on
all hands Confessedly true, that Religion is necessary for the Government of
the World, and that every Ligament of Humane Society without Religion,
is but like a rope of Sand, 'tis probable that the Iesuits Morality being de|structive

of Religion, that the Nations of the World will look on it and their
Society, as an Association against Humane Society, and that one Nation af|ter
another will declare themselves Abhorrers of it. And it must by neces|sity
of Nature appear, that they cannot be Confessors of truth, nor Martyrs
for any but the Devil, that make lying venial; nor can their fate who
pretend to be Witnesses in the Cause of Religion be any other than
is that of some according to the Law and Practice of Nations, who
are Witnesses in any Cause, to have their whole Deposition rejected up|on
the Discovery of one falsity therein. And since 'tis confessed to be the
Doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church, and particularly of the Trent-Council,
that the intention of the Priest is necessary to the validity of a Sa|crament,
who can promise to himself safe anchoring in the Depths of a Je|suits
intentions to make the Sacrament, while he makes Cheating lawful? If
any one shall say, that so vile a thing is not to be supposed in a Priest, as up|on
any occasion not to intend the making of the Sacrament, let him consult
the Additionals to the Mystery of Iesuitism, and there he shall see, p. 95. Pro|position
23. no meaner a Iesuit than the Great Casuist Escobar, cited for this
Assertion, That it is lawful upon Occasion of some great fear to make use of
Dissimulation in the Administration of the Sacraments, as for a man to make as
if he Consecrated, by pronouncing the words without attention. Escobar. Theol.
Moral. Tom. 1. l. 6. Sect. 2. C. 7. Prob. 26. p. 27. And in this point, the
Pope's said Decree is infallible; namely, to shew the fact of this Doctrine of
Devils, having been own'd by Jesuits and Casuists, as appears by the Propo|sition
29th. in the Decree, viz. Vrgens metus gravis est Causa justa Sacramen|torum
administrationem simulandi. O Blessed Jesus, can any Jesuit think it is
lawful for him so far to fear those that can kill the Body as by his Dissembling
his making of thy Body, to destroy anothers Soul by Idolatry? 'Tis among both
Papists and Protestants confessedly true, that if the Host I worship should
not be the Body of Christ, I were a great Idolater; and therefore if a Priest
by that incident Passion of fear may lawfully forbear to intend to make the
Body of Christ, I may well have such a constant fear as do's cadere in Con|stantem
virum, of the danger of my worshipping only a Wafer, and conse|quently
of my being an Idolater: and since a Miracle is Heaven's Broad
Seal to the truth of any Doctrine, and since Transubstantiation is the greatest
Miracle that can be thought of, I may well conclude that God will not
commit the Power of making Millions of Miracles every day to men that
make Cheating lawful, more than a Prince will commit the Custody of his
Broad Seal to a professed Impostor. And therefore I shall  the way affirm,
that the Protestant Religion not making the intention of the Prest essential
to the Sacrament of the Eucharist, is more strongly assertive of the Real
presence there then is the very Popish Hypothesis.
The truth is, 'tis a very inglorious, and a very imprudent thing
to use fraud even in the Conduct of Political Government. My Lord
Herbert in his Life of Harry the Eighth, speaking of a foreign Mo|narch,
saith with great Judgment, but while he escaped not the Opi|nion
and the Name of false (which yet his Country Writers pallae no
otherwise than with calling it Saberraynar) he neither comply'd  his
Dignity, nor indeed the Rules of Wisdom, true reason of State consist|ing
of such solid Maxims that it hath as little need of Deceit, as a sure
Game at Chess of a false Draught: there is no use of it therefore among the
wiser sort, it being only a supply of Ignorance among the Ruder and worse
kind of Statesmen. Beside it appears so much worse in Public Affairs, as it
is never almost hid or unrevenged. Reputation again is still lost thereby, which
yet how much it concerns Princes, none can better tell than such as Imagine them
without it.

But to use Fraud in or for that great concern of Mankind call'd Religion,
is more absur'd: and 'tis the vilest Nonsence imaginable, for Men to talk
deceitfully for God, and that style of a foreign Monarch of Dissembling his In|dignation,
need not be used by him who made the World with a fiat, and
can unmake it with a thought, and whatever Religion in the World is true, I
am sure that is and must be false that attempts to support it self by falshood
or fraud, and by the Violation of Faith given. For I am sure that to stand
to Promises, to abhor Deceit, is a thing in its own nature simply good,
and that it is impossible that God should lye, and if it be simply good in God,
it is necessarily so in Man, whom he hath made after his own Image, the
Image being to answer the Archetype: and that Religion therefore that doth
approve of falsarii, and which cannot have the true God for its Founder,
and in which every honest man may justly say to the Deity of its worshippers,
Stand by thy self, come not near me, for I am holier then thou, (as the Scripture
expression is) must expect to be exterminated out of the Knowing World.
Such worshippers can be no more judged parts of the Ecclesia Catholica, than
Pick-pockets in Churches are of the Coetus fidelium there, and as when these
petty Larceners are there discovered, they are glad silently thence to steal
themselves away, such perhaps will the fate of those grand Impostors too
be after their detection to march out of the Church, and that without the
Parade perhaps of noise of Trumpet, or beat of Drum. There needs no batter|ing
Ram against Fraud, but Detection. And these Arbiters of Calumny, that
like the Month of March came into the World as a Lion, may perhaps go out
of it like a Lamb, and their Morallity naturally come into the number of
Pancirols, Res deperditae, and as not worthy of any Humane care to conserve,
after it has with so much violence been labouring in vain to destroy that old
great invention of God, the Law of Nature. Let any great East or West-India
Company in the World, but once as a Public Society, renounce the ob|servation
of Faith, or Patronize Cheating, and no other Company need en|vy
their growth or Continuance, or pick holes in their Charters, and retain
the loudness of Lawyers to dissolve them. And such is the fate like to be of
any Religionary Society. None need ask where are the Fighters, or where
are the Disputers of this World, to confound an order whose Casuists make
Lying lawful; and yet make it lawful to kill one that gives the Lye.
And the truth is, it is already through the Providence Divine, and like|wise
the Providence and Circumspection of Men so effected, That these
lewd Moralists, that call themselves the Fellows of the Holy Iesus, these
crafty Companions are so detected in the Church, not only as Cheats, but as
having the Plague, that they are avoided by many of the Orders that own
the Pope as their Chief, who will neither admit them to Prattique nor
Quarrentine, and they are in a manner reduced to the state of those Princes,
who force a Trade at home, and only drive one with their own Plantations
abroad. They are already come to the state of Bessus his Collegues in the
Comedy, a sort of military pretenders, who after their Buffetings and Spurnings
they had took from so many, did support their Credit only by this Com|bined
Determination, namely, that they were valiant among themselves: and
this is the present state of these expos'd Casuists of the Church Militant that
have been so long imposing on the World by force and fraud, 'tis agreed on by
them that they are Iust among themselves.
With the help of all that Nature and Art can do, they can never recover
the wounds that have been given them, by the publication of the Les Pro|vinciales,
or the Mystery of Iesuitism discovered in Certain Letters written
on occasion of the differences at Sorbonne between the Jansenists and the Moli|nists,

with additionals, and were Printed in the English Tongue in the Year
1658. And that Great Court of Conscience that is a Court alwayes open (and
where the Judges are too many to be all brib'd or aw'd however some may
sleep) which I may call Conscientia humani generis, having arraign'd and con|demn'd
their Casuistical Tenets as infamous, they are after an Impeachment
and Sentence in that Court to expect no pardon: the World will never for|give
nor forget their making Calumny a Venial Sin; nor their particular bring|ing
into the Field for the service of the art of strongly calumniating Battalions
of Fathers, Schoolmen, Divines of other Orders by Guimenius: who in that
Book of his before mentioned, brings in a multitude of great names of those
great ranks not only to Justify, but even to Sanctify the Crimes charged on
them in those Letters: and as 'twas said of old, Citius efficies Crimen honestum,
quam turpen Catonem, so in Guimenius we do not see any rascall Deer who
were Justly markt or wounded, thrown out of the herd of the Jesuits, but we
see Men who were besmear'd with their own filth and the Dirt the World
threw on them, out-braving the light, and to cleanse themselves from impu|ted
guilt running into the Crouds of Casuists of their own and other Orders,
as likewise among the Fathers, Divines and Schoolmen; and so Magnani|mously
Impious was he, as to make Acts of Cheating and Calumny to be
patroniz'd by holy Church, and openly to excuse the putting Gods Mark on
the Devils Merchandize, and to stamp in effect a legitimacy on them with an
effrontery only to be parallel'd with that which Tully tells us concerning An|tony
the Oratour, who being to defend a Person accus'd of Sedition, boldly went to
prove that Sedition was no Crime, but a very Commendable thing.
But after all their long Casuistical weighing of the Dirt of Vice in Aurificis
stater, or rather in Essay-Masters Scales which turn with the 300^t^h part of a
grain, and as some contriv'd by an honourable Person of the Royal Society,
will turn with the thousandth part of one, it Can never be forgot that they
tell us this Dirt is Gold.
Nor can or will the bold Artifices of the Jesuits before mentioned in eluding
the Popes Decree of the 2^d^. of March, 1679. against their unmoral Divinity,
and of which Declaration the Cloud contains Thunderbolts of Excommunica|tion
against their Tenet of lawful Lying and Perjury, and Equivocating, and
of Dissembling in the administration of the Sacraments, be ever forgot even
by many thinking Papists, or indeed the thinking part of Mankind.
And Protestants may well ask all Papists that Call those damn'd Tenets of
the Jesuits by the Name of Religion, Where was your Religion before the birth
of Luther? for Luther was born above half a hundred years before the birth
of the Society of the Jesuits.
Nay since that Religion has been damn'd by that Decree of the Popes, we
may ask them, Where is your Religion now, where is the Popes Infallibility so
much avow'd and Idolised by the Iesuites heretofore? What, is not the Pope in|fallible
in his Chair, in the Inquisition? was his Chair in the Apostolic Palace in
the Vatican, and attended there by the most Eminent and most Reverend Lords
the Cardinals of the holy Roman Church, being specially deputed by the holy Apo|stolic
See, to be the General Inquisitors for the whole Christian Common-wealth
against all heretical pravity, I say, was that Chair the Chair of Pestilence? Are
not you as Heretics self-Condemn'd in having procur'd your infallible Popes Con|demning
Decree to be suppressed in France as coming from the Pope in the Court
of Inquisition? Alas, do not we know that 'tis all one as to the value of the
Coin, Let the Prince's Mint be kept in this place or the other; and that 'tis
the Sanction of the Pope either in the Consistory, or in the Inquisition at Rome,

that gives the standard of weight and fineness to any Doctrinal Propositions,
and that makes them current? Do we not know it out of the History of the
Councel of Trent, that the Pope told the Cardinals in Consistory, that they
had only Consultive Voices to put things to his consideration, and that the
Decisive Voice belong'd only to him? Do we not know out of that History,
Book 7th, that Laymez the General of the Iesuites spoke with great vehmen
and Master-like in the Councel about two hours, proving that the Power of Iu|risdiction
was given wholly to the Pope, and that none in the Church besides ath
any spark of it but from him, and that while Christ liv'd in the flesh, he govern'd
the World with an absolute Monarchical Government; and being to depart out of
the World, he left the same form, appointing his Vicar St. Peter and his Succes|sors
to administer it as he had done, giving him full and total Power and Iuris|diction,
and subjecting the Church to him as before to himself: That in Councels
be they never so frequent, if the Pope be present, he only doth decree, neither doth
the Councel any thing but approve, and therefore it has been always said Sacro
approbante Concilio; yea even in Resolutions of the greatest weight (as was the
Deposition of the Emperor Frederic the Second in the General Councel of Lions)
Innocent the Fourth, a most wise Pope, refus'd the approbation of that Synod, tha
none might think it to be necessary, and thought it sufficient to say prsente Con|cilio?
How comes the Case now alter'd, when we behold the Iesuites now cruci|fying
the Decree of their King the Pope, after all their former Hanna's to
him, while he was mounted on the World as his Ass, and after all their deaing
of the World with Blessing him in nomine Domini, and see them now putting
but a reed of Infallibility in his hand, and see his Scepter in theirs, and see
their fourth Vow to the Pope annull'd, and what performance then can Hereticks
expect from any Promises they make to them? and might not the Iesuits wi
the salvo of a Protestation against the Inquisition, or with a thousand Expedients,
if they had pleas'd, allow'd Receipts from the Inquisition, to rid the World of a
Pestilence, as frankly as Protestants use the Jesuits Powder against Agues, and
without intending more Honour to that Court, than the Sacred Writ did to the
Devil, in recording for our instruction several things by him spoken? And have
not we a candid account of this Arcaum in a very Ingenious Discourse lately
Translated into English, and call'd, The Policy of the Clergy of France to de|stroy
the Protestants of that Kingdom, and writ in the way of a Dialogue be|tween
a Parisian and Provincial, where p. 67, and 68. Le Cheise and the Ie|suits
Party are said to have effected the suppression of the said Decree in France,
upon pretence that it issued from the Tribunal of the Inquisition, and that in the
Draught of an Order of a Parliament in France, for the suppressing the Publica|tion
of this Decree, these words were put, viz. Tho that these Propositions are
justly Condemned, and that Father Le Cheise caus'd these words to be raed out,
and has put in their stead, That even the good things which come to us from the
Tribunal of the Inquisition, ought not to be receiv'd?
But if upon occasion of what was discours'd by that Author, it be further said,
that the setting up of those unmoral Casuistical Tenets in France, was the erect|ing
a Pillar of ignominy against God, I will ask if one who is revera an incompe|tent
Iudge shall go to demolish any such Pillar set up against my Father, and I have
already own'd that that Iudge doth infallibly know the bounds of his Iurisdiction,
and have obliged my self to him by the foremention'd fourth Vow, that what thing
soever he shall Command that belongs to the profit of Souls, and the Propagation
of the Faith, I will without any tergiversation or excuse execute, as far as I
am able (for this is the Jesuits fourth Vow to the Pope) shall I then be active
in the hindring a Decree of this Nature, given by this Judge from being exe|cuted,
at the same time, I Protest against it, shall I make no Protestation
for the honour of my Father? And do you think in this Inquisitive Age the Cheat

of an Inquisition, will elsewhere pass long, since that Court that is used by
ordinary Inquisitors for the torturing the Bodies of Christians, and mutilation
of the Image of God, cannot be allow'd to shew severity to the body of Sin, to the
Image of the Devil in depraved Minds, and that while your unerring Iudge of
Law and Fact is in Person there praesiding? Are not you that surpre the Dictates
of your own Vniversal Pastor such unreasonable Men as we may well pray to be
delivered from?
All our Jesuited Papists must still expect Expostulations of this Nature.
Their Head was before at Rome, and their Brains too; but if they now
make a Schism from the Pope himself, they will come under the Denomina|tion
of Acephali (the Name of some ancient Heretics) that is, the People
without a Head, unless they will own the Hydra of the Jesuits for their
Head, which it seems the Hercules of Rome could not subdue. I believe ma|ny
of them will consider what sure footing they have where they are, while
they see their Moses flying from his own Staff when made a Serpent, I mean his
Order of Jesuits, and see the Collusive or Sham-Serpents of the Jesuits de|vour
those of their Moses, and Juglers by Deceptio Visus and lying to impose
on the eyes of the World against the sence and reason of Mankind, and even of
the Pope himself, and 'twill be very ridiculous for them, who have been
cheated out of their own Religion, to think that some who are the Jesuits
Bubbles can cheat us of ours, and that while they are grown Seekers, they
should make us loose our Church; and that when the Spiritual Monarchy of the
Pope is in a manner Run Down by the Republic or Society of the Iesuits, they
should think to cheat us of our King and Church, and that our Religion can
be run down by such Spiritual Outlaws, and Rebels against the Pope him|self,
and such as perhaps the Pope may in time be induced to oblige the World
by suppressing after their Injuring all Morallity, and the most vital parts of
Christian Religion, and the great avow'd use of his Power in the whole
Christian Common-wealth, by their Suppression of his said Decree. I hope
while the Fan is in his hand he will throughly purge his floor, and esteem the
Disposals of rich Benefices in France to be poor Regalia sancti Petri, for him
to vindicate in Comparison of the lives of the Souls of his Flock, that he, and
all ingenuous Knowing Mankind, Know must be destroy'd by such Casuisti|cal
Principles; and without his doing which, he cannot in the least deserve
the Title of his Holiness.
For the determining the truth about such Principles, he need not say as
one of his Predecessors did about the Iansenian Speculations, that he had no skill
in Divinity. A very little skill in Natural Divinity (and such as may be had
by the Reading a few Lines in Tully's Offices) would accomplish any one with
what would demonstrate the things allowed by the Casuists to be un|worthy
both of the Divine and Humane Nature; and all the Jesuit's
Skill in Divinity will never be able to render them otherwise to the
World.
I must seriously profess, that one saying of the Great Cicero in that little Book,
viz, Ea deliberanda omnino non sunt, in quibus est turpis ipsa deliberatio, i. e. Those
things are not at all to be deliberated wherein the Deliberation it self is filthly;
has in it I think more frank generous Morality included, and that which is
more worthy of the ancient Roman and Primitive Christian simplicity, then
what all the Libraries stuff'd with Bauny, Escobar, Layman, Le Moine, Navarrus,
Azorius, Molina, Tanuerus, Lessuis, Emanuel Sa, Henriquez, and other Nu|merous
Casuistical Jesuits have furnished the world with, wherein they do so
nicely and infinitely divide the body of Sin in semper divisibilia, and indeed
make it an infinite Nothing. But the world I think will not long deliberate
what to do with this Casuistical Divinity, of which no truer Description can

be given, then that 'tis a Deliberation of Sin. I do not know any that
would eate or drink with another that he thought did deliberate to Poison
him. Dum deliberant (saith Tacitus) desciverunt: i. e. While they do deli|berate
whether they should revolt, they have revolted: their very deliberation
and consulting was ipso facto a Revolt.
I doubt not but many Pious Christians of the Roman Catholic Commu|nion
have Complain'd of the effect of their subtle and innumerable distin|ctions
destroying Christianity, in that style of the Woman in the Gospel, They
have taken away My Lord, and I know not where they have Layd him; and that
Considering those Casuists had so far sear'd their Consciences and brazen'd
their Foreheads as in the Patronizing of Calumny and other Impieties to defy
not only Christs Gospel, but the Pope's own Canon Law, many Papists impor|tun'd
the Pope with their Zeal sutable to that of the Psalmist's, to give that
decree, saying, It is time for thee to work, for they have made void thy
Law.
'Tis notorious that the Canon Law (as bad as it is) is very severe against
Calumny and Calumniators, and especially against Clergy-men that are such,
and pronounceth a Clergy-man infamous who is convicted of defaming an|other:
and 'twas very well worthy the Vigilance of the Pope, not to let the
Jesuits steal away his Canon Law from him.
But this must needs be very diverting to this inquiring Age, to see Pro|testants
as well as Papists accounting the Popes reducing some immorallities
to the Test of his own Canon Law, a piece of Reformation, and the Pope strug|gling
to effect it, and hindred by the Jesuits therein.
According to the former expression, it is time for the Pope to work and to
Null that Order that thus nulls his aforesaid Decree in the sight of an awaken'd
World, and is else likely to Null his Church, the Patience of Mankind being
the less able longer to bear the weight of Jesuitical Calumnies by its having
endured them so long.
The truth is, the Great and Original Cause of the founding of that Order
being to cut Heretics Throats, (for at this plain rate we must speak and call
a Spade a Spade when they are digging our Graves with it) it was necessary
for them to use the art of blackening of Heretics by Calumnies as the Prologue
to that Tragedy, the which would cause the Heretics to fall unpity'd; and
'twas necessary to make that black art as lawful as they Could, that so they
might have their quietus from the World for the arrear of their pass'd frauds,
and not fear accounting for future ones.
But as these men will not recede from their Art, so neither will Nature
recede from it self, and our Critical English World now having occasion to
pass Judgment of their Calumnies, is naturally enforced to Conider their
former Shammes in States and Kingdomes to aggravate their present ones, as
Judges still in the Case of Malefactors are obliged to take notice of their ha|ving
been formerly branded for the same Crimes.
The execrable Shamme made against the Admiral and others as conspiring
to kill the King of France, and giving provocation to the Parisian Massacre,
will never be forgot; nor the Shamme that was provided to have charged
the Puritans with the Gun-Powder Treason; nor that of the Irish Rebels, who
were so outragiously impudent as to pretend the Commission of our Royal
Martyr for their Butcheries: Nor yet that of the Jesuites having effected
heretofore in Bohemia, and lately in Hungary, that Counterfeit and forged
Letters should be found in the Custody of the Protestants, to charge them
with Crimes against Caesar. The Memorial of the Sufferings of the Protestant
Ministers in Hungary at the Instigation of the Popish Clergy there, printed
for William Nott, in the Pallmall, 1676. shews it at Large, where 'tis said,

They did not (against the Ministers) insist much on the Particulars that relate to
Religion, but great endeavours were used to prove them Complices of the Rebel|lion,
the which their Advocates and Councel did manifestly disprove, and the
Resident of the States of the Vnited Provinces at Vienna did afterward in a
Memorial to the Emperour fully and solidly refute. Tho the Ministers were in|dicted
in form of Law, for having assisted the Rebels by their Councel, and sup|ply'd
them with Provisions, and for having Made way for the Turks to Come in
and wast that Kingdome, yet none of them (as that Discourse sets forth) was con|victed
thereof, nor one clear Testimony brought to prove that any one was a Com|plice
of that Rebellion.
That discourse shews that the Advocatus Fisci did exhibit everal Letters to
prove all the Ministers Complices of that Rebellion, but that many and great
presumptions evinced that these Letters were never produced, tho it was fre|quently
demanded by the Ministers and their Advocates that they might be, and
that yet they could never obtain any thing but a printed Copy of them; and th
the Advocates for the Ministers did often press the Fiscal to declare when, where
or how he came by these Letters, yet that was never done.
That Author having p. 10. mentioned the vile art of Calumny, That the
Jesuits try'd to exterminate the Protestants out of Hungary by, speaks in p.
11th. of the effects of their endeavours, saying, that upon a Iust account it can be
made appear that at several times before and after the Citation against the Pro|testants,
(meaning the Citation to that vile Process) there were above 1200
Chruches of them suppressed.
It must needs then appear very Ridiculous to the World, that when there
is not a third part of Hungary (that old Bulwark of Christendom against the
Turks) remaining in the Emperor's hands, (for so Dr. Brown in his late Tra|vels
there Computes it) that these Nominal fellows of Christ by nominal
crimes charged on real Christians, should endanger the exterminating of
Christianity out of the European World, and the making the Emperor not long
so much as a Nominal King in Germany it self, and that the Emperor should be
more afraid of the Itch of his remote Subjects, then of the plague of his nea|rer
Foes, and that the Jesuits disliking the Itch after new Doctrines in the
Hungarians should be reputed good advising Doctors, who counsel him to
pass the time in scratching and lancing with his nails his own members, when
many Thousands of armed men are designing against his Life and Crown, and
when his Empire is brought to such a state, that as 'twas said of the Roman
Empire when devolv'd on Germany, that one might quaerere Imperium in Impe|rio,
that the danger now hangs over it of the German Empire being there sought
too, and all by the true Real Imperium in Imperio of the Jesuits there.
And indeed the biceps aquila, which is the Insigne or Arms of the Empire,
might be properly of late referr'd to the divisum Imperium the Emperor had
with the Jesuits, whom to every abecedarian in Politics 'tis known to be
more his interest during the present grandeur of France, to dismiss from his
Councels, than ever 'twas the Venetians to deal so with the Ecclesiastics.
My Lord, I should not have thought it good manners to have been so
copious in the exercise of your Lordships Patience with the particularities of
the unmoral or unmannerly doctrine of the Casuists as to the Point of Ca|lumny,
but that I thought some Oyl of these Scorpions that you have not the
leisure to extract out of their dead Authors, might be useful to you in the re|pelling
the venom of their stings sooner then you are aware.
And indeed as 'tis observed, that the Last bitings of some dying animals are
most fierce, so is it likely to be with their last efforts, namely those of their
Calumnies against Protestants, which I believe will likewise be their derniers

Resort; and 'tis therefore your Lordships and every Protestants Concern,
who is a Lover of Justice, to know that you wrong'd any Jesuited Papists, if
in Capital Causes you did believe them not to practice in that case the Prin|ciple
they profess, namely the making Calumny venial, a thing so expressly
own'd in the 15^t^h Letter of the Les Provinciales, that they were Call'd by some
of the Sorbon on that account Quintadecimani, in allusion to the Quartadeci|man
Heretics of old.
'Tis said in that 15^t^h Letter, That this is so notorious a Doctrine of their
Schools that they maintained it not only in their books but also in their public
Theses, which certainly is the height of Confidence, as among others in their
Theses of Louvain of the Year 1645. in these termes, It is only a venial Sin to
Calumniate, and impose false Crimes, to ruine their Credit who speak ill of us:
quidni non nisi veniale sit, detrahentis authoritatem tibi noxiam falso crimine
elidere? and this doctrine is so much in vogue among you, that you treat him as
an Ignorant and Temerarius person, who presumes any way to oppose it: and pre|sently
after, tis related how Father Dicastellus said, that to prove that twas no
Mortal Sin to use Calumny though grounded on absolute falsities, against a Calum|niator,
he had brought a Cloud of their Fathers to witness it, and whole Vniver|sities
Consisting of them all whom he had Consulted, and among others the Reve|rend
Father John Gans Confessor to the EMPEROR, all the public and ordinary
Professors of the Vniversity of Vienna, (consisting wholly of Iesuits) and that
he had likewise on his side Father Pennalossa a Iesuit Preacher to the Empe|ror,
c.
But the aforesaid probable opinion of Calumny will never be received in this
Age of Demonstration, and since the old Roman Laws enjoyn a Iuramentum
Calumniae, an Oath of Calumny, (as was before remark'd) whereby every liti|gant
was to invocate God as Witness and Revenger about his not using any
false proof Knowingly, the Christian World in this Knowing Age will Know
those who make the use of false proofs knowingly to be a Venial Sin, and it
must certainly appear ridiculous to Iudges and Iurors to give the least re|spect
to such gamesters Oaths who trumpet forth that Principle that 'tis a
Venial Sin to use false Dice of the Law to make true ones of Protestants
Bones.
My Lord, I am not so unjust and uncharitable as to cast a brand on the
Body of the Papists, as not being capable of the Dignity of Witnesses.
I doubt not but there are in the external Communion of the Church of
Rome very many Thousands who by Divine Grace are kept from Communi|cating
with that Church in many of its Principles and Practices, and that in|vincible
ignorance may render many of them excusable, and that the great
mortifications and austerities and zealous devotions not only among many
persons of their Religious Orders, but of the Common people, shewing them
heroically Vertuous, do entitle them to have their testimony in any matters
of fact received with honour equal with that of the best Protestants.
And as to many of our Papists in England it must be with Justice acknow|ledged,
that their having descended from antient Families, and having had
ingenuous Education, and plentiful Fortunes, and their having seen the World
abroad, where they have observed many of the Principle, of the Jesuits as
much detested by Papists as they can be by Protestants, and their generous
inclinations to serve Vertue and Morality, may well secure us from fears of
their being imposed on by Iesuits to use little or great unholy Shammes and
Calumnies for the good of holy Church, a sort of Penance that must needs seem
odious in Nature to well-bred Gentlemen and Men of Estates, not tempted
like little hungry Greeks to leap up to Heaven, or down to Hell for bread, under
the which mean classe of Mankind (according to my intelligence) those Pa|pists

have generally fallne who have been famous for Shamming and Subor|nation
as to the late Plot.
'Tis therefore no wonder that Papists in the Low-Countries are not tempted
to use any Shammes to promote their Religion, it being necessity that com|pels
men to turpitude, and the very Alms-men there not being ad incitas re|dacti.
And against some of our English Papists, being allowed to be dignitaries
as to faith of testimony, whom I have before described, I shall never except.
But for any English Papist who is a believer of the Tenets of the Iesuits,
and some other Casuists to Expect to be believ'd against any that honors not
their Society, (which none that upholds humane Society and would not have
Mankind trick'd out of the Light and Law of Nature can do) is to render a
man irreverent to himself and his Maker, and to shew his want of a Curator
by the prodigallity of his Faith, especially when he shall call to mind how
Del Rio the famous Iesuit affirm'd that the Dominicans ought not to be al|lowed
as witnesses against the Iesuites, a charge that Guymenius p. 127,  128.
in vain Contends to evade.
But this their dernier Resort (as I call'd it) of their use and application of
their erroneous or rather diabolical doctrine of Calumny, must certainly be
fatal to them; according to that Proverb in the Gospel about the last error,
 erit novissinus error pejor priore. The High Priests and Pharisees came to
Pilate saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive,
After three dayes I will rise again; Command therefore that the Sepulchre be
made sure till the third day, lest his Disciples come by Night and steal him away
and say to the people he is risen from the dead: So the Last error shall be worse
than the first: and they Judged right enough of the Last error Confounding
more than the First, as it is the force of the Last motion from a Precipice that
breaks a man in pieces; and this effect of the last error was presently exem|plify'd
in themselves; for they having caus'd the holy Sepulchre to be very
strongly guarded, and the Door of it to be barricado'd with a very great
Stone, and that Stone to be seal'd, and the Lord of Glory after all this over|powring
the Grave and Guards, they had a Consult and gave the Guards
Money to spread that Shamme in the World, that his Disciples did steal him
away while the Guards slept, and saith St. Mathew, this is reported among the
Iews to this day.
And lo, as Christ did rise for our Iustification, so did this Subornation used
by those Impostors justify the truth of his Resurrection, which else could not
so well have confronted the Worlds incredulity: for if after his Resurrection
his Disciples believed not Mary Magdalen, Ioanna, and the Mother of Iames,
who told them that he had appear'd to them, and if the two Disciples that
told the Rest that he had appear'd to them going to Emmaus were not be|liev'd
by them, and if when he appear'd in the midst of Ten of them at once
and shew'd them his hands and his side, they believ'd not for joy, and if when
he appear'd to the Women and bade them tell the Disciples and St. Peter, that
according to his Promise they should see him in Galilee, and if the Eleven
Disciples went into Galilee to a Mountain which he had appointed them, and
yet when they saw him there they worship'd but some doubted, and if Christ
almost in his Last words upbraided them with their unbelief, because they be|liev'd
not them who had seen him after he was risen, the Pagan and Iewish
World would not have been brought to easily as they were to the belief of
his Resurrection, the great hinge on which the Christian Religion turns, and
without which the Preaching of the Cross would not so much have seem'd
foolishness as been madness.
Thus did that last Jewish error prove most fatal to Judaisme, and as Hea|ven

was extracted by the Divine Power out of the Hellish act of Murdring
the holy Iesus, so was the propagation of the truth of his Resurrection out of
the Calumny, Subornation and Bribery used to suppress it, those artifices be|ing
so odious in the eye of the Law of all Nations, that they make any that
uses them to gain infamy and loose his Cause, and to make sure of the hatred
ofone very Considerable Enemy, namely Mankind; and justly, for against
that great Body is every one that professeth Calumny an aggressor, and has pro|claim'd
War.
And Granting that Nature is Constant to it self, and that conslusions of
the working of the Passions in humane Nature in future times may be made
from the pass'd, Our Quintadecimani (th their Order seems in many politi|cal
Principles to be close compacted like the scales of Leviathan,) by the
publishing of the Tenets before mentioned and constant practice of them
have brought themselves into the shallows, and they are like Whales on ground
gazed on by the Critical World, and there labouring under the fatality of
their own weight.
It has been observed by that deep Enquirer into Nature, Monsieur Descartes,
that Le bon sens est chose du monde, mieux partag c. Nothing is more equally
distributed by Nature among Meu than Vnderstanding and Reason, for every
Man thinks he has enough: and of this opinion was Mr. Hobbes in that Chapter
in his Leviathan, of the Natural condition of Mankind, Where he saith, That
as to the Faculties of the Mind there is a greater equality among men then that
of strength: for prudence, saith he, is but experience which equal time bestowes on
all men in those things they equally apply themselves to.
That which perhaps makes such equality incredible, is but a vain conceit of ones
own wisdom, which all mortal men think they have in a greater degree than the
Vulgar, that is then all men but themselves and a few others whom by fame or for
Concurring, with themselves they approve: for such is the Nature of men, that
howsoever they may acknowledg many others to be more Witty or more Eloquent
or more Learned, yet they will hardly believe many so wise as themselves: for
they see their own witt at hand, and other mens at distance.
But this proves rather that men are in that Point equal than unequal: For
there is not ordinarily a greater sign of the equal distribution of any thing, then
that every man is Content with his share.
Admitting this great observation of those two great Masters of Witt and
Philosophy to be true, One would suppose that Nature did not in vain implant
in men such a general notion of their equality in Wisdome, nor without an in|tent
of promoting the good of humane Society thereby. The God of Na|ture
hath not only not given us any members of our bodies, but not the ve|ry
hair of our eye-browes, nor even the hairs of our eye-lids in vain; for
our eye-lids are fortify'd with those little stiff bristles as with palisado's against
the assaults of Flyes and such like bold animalcula: and I may say, that that
general Notion doth defend the Eyes of mens Minds from being too easily
imposed on by particular Notions and Shammes occurring to us from
any.
And as to that notion so universally planted in mens Souls by Nature, one
may well imagine that what a Gardiner plants in every bed of his Garden,
is no weed; and perhaps one great End of Nature in the general implanta|tion
of this principle in men may be The shewing them the folly and danger
of their attempts, who think to engross that great Staple Commodity of the
intellectual World call'd Wisdome, and to force others to buy that Commo|dity
of which they think they have enough of their own by them, and espe|cially
when they see that others would force a trade on them by counterfeit
Wares, and have been already branded for so doing.

The truth is, every man's life who pretends to a greater share of Wisdome
than his Neighbour, is in the better state of security by this Notion before-mentioned;
for if a man thought others by their Wisdom could render his
ineffectual for his preservation, he would fear and hate them for their ability
to hurt him: and as Toads th not Known to do any hurt are kill'd some
times for the imagin'd pretious Stones in their heads, such might be the
fate of men for the value of their Brains, and which depretiate the worth of
others. I conclude therefore that any Order or Society must take what fol|lowes
from being thought Nusances and Enemies to Mankind, and prepare
for a political death or dissolution, who think themselves able by artifices to
devest men of the property they have in their Understandings, and to out|wit
their wisdome, and who both hang out to the World a new light, and
proclaim a new Law of Nature contrary to the old, (notwithstanding the
out-cry of Nations that nolumus legem naturae mutari,) and who Calumniate
all that allow not the doctrine of Calumny, and invent Crimes to Cut off the
heads that will not ly at their feet, th yet they can invent no crimes (even
Regicide not excepted) but what the Invention of their Theology has made
lawful, and think that an hypothesis may renitente mundo call it self Religion
or Politics, which if it were universally receiv'd, would not leave the World
one minute out of a state of Warr, for it ipso facto dissolves all Pactions, and
cancels all Allegiance, and nulls all hopes of Protection; insomuch that in a
Gaming-house that agreed on cheating, the play could not be worth the candles
at a days end, and each of the cheaters must be reduced to cheat by himself;
and thus too any one that makes fraud venial, cannot be sure that any par|ticipants
with him in Sedition will keep their word; and he must rebel by
himself too against an irritated world, that was never made only for any to
play in and with, and which must needs with inconceiveable regret see those
men who make all accusations and testimony in nature uncertain, instrumen|tal
in the inflicting of the punishment of Certain death thereupon, and see a Re|ligion
that is dying a Natural death, make any Religious men dy by a violent,
and observe that its inventors do in a positive and dictatorian way propound
Principles that such sturdy propounders cannot themselves believe, till like
Geta, a Citizen of Rome, who having long as a disguise wore a patch over
one of his Eyes, he lost the use of it for ever, they have by habituating
their Understandings long to dissimulation, lost the use of their faculty of
discerning.
And this is the Case between Mankind and the Iesuits, neither better nor
worse, and is like to be the fate of these, and especially Considering that
their Principles have both Weight and Numbers to Contest with, I mean
the weight of Arguments, and the Numbers of their own and our Reli|gion.
There is no Resisting the Power of Nature where those two things
meet.
We see by frequent observation in our own Land, that the very breath
of the people like that of a Canon Bullet proves destructive, aud what then
will not the breath of incensed Mankind do?
They have Numbers to Contest with that their Principles have infected
with Calumny, who think it scarce a Venial Sin to pay any man in the false
Coyn that was received from him, and who will be making it as lawful as
they Can, not to play upon the square with false Gamesters: and as the
strong are naturally apt to repel force by force, so are the weak, to repel
fraud by fraud, and will be tempted to make an ill use of the lex talionis, and
to account the pursuing of them with wild defamatory Reports to be but fol|lowing
them in their own Wild-goose-chace.

Iarrigius in his Book printed together with that call'd the Iesuits on the
Scaffold, saith, While there was any thing of the League left in France, all the
slight the Iesuits had to weaken the authority and elude the unavoidable accu|sations
of the Pasquiers, the Servines, the Arnauds of that time was to persuade
the Credulous people, that those incomparable Men were fautors of Calvinisme,
and thereby imagin'd themselves sufficiently vindicated as to the horrid Crimes
and execrable Parricides wherewith they were charged by those illustrious Offi|cers
of State in France, if in some wretched answers they accused them of heresie.
So stale and senseless has that humour of the Iesuites been to call all that op|posed
them, Presbyterians.
But any who reads the very Learned Epistle of the Bishop of Lincoln to
the discourse of the discovery of the Gunpowder Treason Printed in the Year
1670. will find that he there Cites Alphon. de Vargas Toletanus for saying,
That all the Vniversities of Spain, in a Book against the Iesuits printed and sent
to the King of Spain, give this Character of them, that they are fraudulenti men|daces,
veritatis interversores, Infamatores virtutis, Impostores Pietatis Velo
operti, lupi in vestimentis ovium, Novitatum amici, Sanctorum Doctorum Con|temptores,
Lutheri Calvini partiarii, ac de haeresi suspecti, pacis publicae per|turbatores,
Diabolicae Industriae homines, serpentes, ipsi Cacodaemones ac ab
omnibus Cavendi ac fugiendi: fraudulent, lyars, Corrupters of truth, defamers
of Virtue, Impostors under a veil of Piety, Wolfes in sheeps clothing, lovers of
Novelties, Contemners of the holy Doctors, partners with Calvin and Luther, and
suspected of heresie, troublers of the Public Peace, men of Diabolical industry,
Serpents, and very Devils, and to be shun'd and avoided, or fled from by all
men.
Thus their hands and heads being against every one, by a tacit Paction and
Confederation of Nature almost all mens are so against them.
They and other Casuists and Jesuited Papists have complain'd of Shammes
and Calumnies put on them by Protestants in England since the Plott; and
no doubt if they have not suffer'd in that kind, they may expect it, all Pro|testants
having not attain'd to the temper of St. Michael the Arch-Angel to
forbear Railing accusations, nor to the holiness of St. Bartholomew, who 'tis
said by continual Prayer had his Knees as hard as a Camels.
I have read of an Antidote against the Poyson of Calumny and false testi|mony
beyond what Protestants could Compass, namely, an Indulgence granted
by Pope Innocent the 8^t^h to every man and woman that bears upon him or her
the length of Christs Nails wherewith he was fastned to the Cross, (the Iust length
of which was Nine Inches) and worships them daily with five Pater-Nosters, and
five Aves and a Creed, that he or she shall have granted them, these great gifts:
the first is that he shall never dye a sudden, nor evil death: the second is that
he shall never be slain with the Sword or weapon: the third is, his Enemies shall
never overcome him: the fourth is poyson, nor false witness shall never grieve
him.
By my Consent every Protestant and Papist shall in this Pestilential time
of Shammes Carry this Antidote about him; but whether this be a Shamme-Indulgence
or no, and put upon the Pope, and invented by Some non-Papists;
I know not. My Author for it is Mr. Iohn Gee, Master of Arts of Exeter
Colledge in Oxford, in his Book 4^t^o Call'd New Shreds of the Old Share, p. 103.
Printed at London in the Year 1624. In any such wretched Contention be|tween
the faex Romuli and any of the Protestants here who should become most
impure by Calumny, as the Protestants being much more Numerous than
the Papists would be able to out-shamme them, and to make the more plain
detections of the Shammes contriv'd by their Adversaries, it would likewise
go the harder with any Sect, that the Majority of Numbers would thus run

down with Shammes in this Nation at this Conjuncture of time, when the
many swarms of those who offer at Wit, and think they merit the being call'd
Witts, by doing the exercise in a Coffey-house, Call'd Baldring, that is, with
a serious grave face, telling idle feign'd Stories farced with particular Cir|cumstances
to ensnare the belief of the Credulous, which kind of ungenerous
triumphing over weak Understandings by ridiculous Shammes, is a false sort
of wit and humour below not only the gravity of the English Nation, but the
levity of the French, and used by none but Fools who stand for the place of
being Knaves.
There is no doubt but the talent of these foolish Shammers as their interest
and dependances or humors incline them to wish well either to Popery or
Protestancy extending to abuse the belief of the unthinking Vulgar with little
romantic Stories concerning those Religions, helps to Convey them into the
Press which gives wings to these Shams presently to fly round the King|dome.
If the Papists think the Press hath not in any of the Pamphlets it dayly
spits, charged them with Calumny, and of Such a Nature as to bring univer|sal
odium on them by alarming the Kingdom almost as much as it could be
by forrain invasion, and occasionally laying a Tax on men to buy what Arms
for their defence the Law allowes, I will ask them what they think of one of
our printed Intelligences that Came out on the 26^t^h of February 1680/1, where|in
'tis said, Last Fryday came a Letter from Stafford, directed to one Bacchus
Tenant to the Lord Stafford from one Wilson in Cheshire, but ordered to be
left with one Finny of Stafford to be sent to the said Bacchus: but Finny ob|serving
Letters so directed to pass through his hands, and apprehending they
might relate to some dangerous Correspondence, took the liberty to Open this, and
therein to his great surprize found directions to Bacchus for burning of Stafford
and several great Towns: upon which making a speedy discovery to a Magistrate,
Bacchus was sent for, who after some evasions did confess he had received Let|ters
to that purpose. And just now the said Wilson is apprehended and commit|ted,
and confesseth he was by the order of a Certain Lord, to fire Stafford,
Drayton, Shrewsbury, Nantwich, Chester, Congerton, New-Castle Under-Line,
and two more, and that he was to have 900 l. for fireing those Nine
Towns.
I having never heard of any Proclamation or proceedings either of the
Magistracy or Lievtenancy of this Kingdom after such an alarm of public
hostility and of a Rebellion hatch'd in the Kingdom, nor of the last punish|ment
inflicted on the pretended Certain Lord that was the General of those
Incendiaries, did look on them under the Notion of an Army in disguise.
But whatever ground the Protestant Religion hath got or shall get by
these poor means, I desire that it may go to the Next occupant; for not only
the ayr it exhales is Pestilential, but it includes that ayr in it which may pro|duce
Earthquakes, which dangers therefore the New Popish or Jesuited Reli|gion
must be exposed to by the ayr of Shams and Calumnies.
My Lord, I shall here entertain your Lordship with somewhat very Re|markable
out of the Book of Father Parsons of the Succession, whereby you
will see that instead of Allowing the oportet esse haereses, he doth in effect tell
us, that while the Kingdom has two Religions in it, oportet esse Calumnias:
that great Jesuite having with much agility danced on the high rope as to
the Casuistical part of the Question of the Succession, affects to do it too in the
Politics, but miss'd his Center of gravity in his motion both as a Divine and
a States-man, and did shamefully fall in either Capacity, as your Lordship
will find by the reading of his words. He saith, p. 217. being near the Con|clusion
of the first part of his Book, And thus much now for matter of Con|science.

But if we Consider Reason of State also and worldly Policy, it Cannot
be but great folly and oversight for a man of whatsoever Religion he be, to pro|mote
to a Kingdom in which himself must live one of a Contrary Religion to him|self:
for let the bargains and agreements be what they will, and fair promises
and vain hopes never so great, yet seeing the Prince once made and settled, must
needs proceed according to the Principles of his own Religion, it follows also, that
he must Come quickly to break with the other party, tho he loved him never so
well (which yet perhaps is very hard if not impossible for two of different Reli|gions
to love sincerely) but if it were so, yet many jealousies, suspicions, accusa|tions,
Calumniations, and other aversions must needs light upon the Party that is
of different Religion from the State and Prince under whom he lives, as not only
he Cannot be Capable of such Preferments, Honours, Charges, Government and
the like, which men may deserve and desire in their Commonwealth, but also he
shall be in Continual danger, and subject to a thousand molestations and injuries,
which are incident to the Condition and state of him that is not Current with the
same Course of his Prince and Realm in matters of Religion; and so before he be
aware, he becomes to be accounted an Enemy or backward man: which in Mind he
must either dissemble deeply, and against his own Conscience make shew to favour
and set forward that which in his heart he doth detest, which is the greatest Ca|lamity
and Misery of all other, tho yet many times not sufficient to deliver him
from suspicion; or else to avoid this everlasting perdition, he must break with all
the temporal Commodities of this life, which his Country and Realm might yield
him; and this is the ordinary end of all such men, how soft and sweet soever the
beginning be.
This Iesuite (who was before mention'd to have been Call'd one of the grea|test
Men that his Order has produced) was here (it seems) a States-man in his
heart, and no More: and has very honestly foretold all Protestants that shall
live under a Prince of another Religion, how dishonest Roman Catholics will
prove to them. The Jesuite was here an Almanac-maker, who predicted no|thing
to Protestants but Lightning and Thunder, and too the Continual Rain|ing
of Snares upon them during such a Conjuncture, and the causing each of
them to be with the darts of Calumny and obloquy forever stuck round like the
figure of the man in the Almanac: but how foolish Father Parsons was to write
this when the Protestants had the Ball at their foot, and when he could not
be sure that the Papists would ever arrive at the state, to have it alwayes at
theirs, let any one Judge. He had before used that rhetorical expression, that
so the Ship be well and happily guided, I esteem it not much important of what
Race or Nation the Pilot be, but he was extremely impolitic, by so early and
public an alarm to notify it to many who thought that embarqued in the
Civil Government of a Prince of any Religion, they might be safely tran|sported
from this World to the Next, that Popish Masters of the Ship have
determin'd before-hand to throw all heterodox Passengers overboard, and
their own Oaths and engagements to them likewise.
But what ever person takes a promissory Oath with an intent of not keep|ing
it, may well be Concluded as actually guilty of perjury in the Court of
Heaven, as he who knowingly takes a false assertory Oath. They have both
equally presumed to try by solemn lying to weather the fear of Divine Om|niscience
and Omnipotence and both their assertory and promissory Oaths are
of equal weight in the ballance of humane judgment.
And because I think the Argument will hold from the falsity of their
Oaths promissory in this their dernier Resort aforesaid, to the obtaining the
Worlds Sentence against the truth of their Oaths assertory, I shall entertain
your Lordship with an instance of one of the Church of Rome, of whom it
may be said, that a Greater than Father Parsons is here, to vindicate the

making of Oaths promissory with an intent of breaking them, and 'tis Pope
Clement the 8^t^h, of whom Danaeus saith in his Chronology of Popes, that he
was , the 'O Politician, as I may say, of whom D'Ossat in his Third
Book, Letter 81, viz. to Villeroy in the Year 1597, speaking there how he
had discover'd the Popes Inclinations, that the King of France should break with
England, and that he told his Holiness that the King's making a particular
profession to keep his word would not suffer him to break that Alliance that had
been so lately renew'd and sworn, saith, that the Pope thereupon reply'd, That
that Oath was made to a heretic, and that his Majesty had made another Oath to
God and the Pope: And further mentions what the Pope had told him at other
times and in the precedent audience, That Kings and Soverain Princes did per|mit
to themselves all things that turn'd to their profit, and that none blamed
them for it or took it ill from them, and alledged to that purpose a Saying of
Francisco Maria Duke of Urbin, who was wont to say, That if a plain Gentleman
broke his word he would be dishonour'd by it; but that Soveraign Princes for
Reason of State without any great blame might make Treaties and break them,
and Mentir, trahir,  toutes telles autres choses, i. e. Ly, and betray, and do
all things of that nature: whereupon saith D'Ossat, I had but too much to re|ply
to that, but I did not think it my duty there to stay my self in a place so slip|pery.
But toward the close of the Letter he adds, By what is abovesaid you
see tho the Pope has no disrespect for the King of France, nor any love for the King
of Spain, yet the hatred that he has for Heretics, transports him so far, that he
lets fall from his Mouth (tho under the Name of another) some pernicious Maximes
unworthy of an honest man, and that the Pope accounts all ways good for his Ma|jesty
to break with his Allyes, because they are not Catholics, altho those ways
are infamous. I am so far a Concurrer with that Pope, as to think that ac|cording
to the Law of Nature and Nations, the Oath and Promise to the first
of any Prince's Allies is most obligatory; and therefore the Pope doth very
honestly notify his opinion, that Harry the 4^t^h intended not to keep any pro|missory
Oath Contrary to that made to God and himself. But the Pope mi|stakes
the factum of that Great Prince's Oaths; and 'tis for the honour of the
Roman Catholic Religion, that it has left to Posterity so great an instance
of a Protestant Prince turn'd a Papist, and Continuing kind to the persons of
Protestants. But they owed no thanks to the Pope or Iesuites for his making
or keeping Promises and Alliances with Protestants. The Bohemian History
tells us how Ferdinand about the Year 1617, before he was possest of that Crown,
did by Oath bind himself, that Matthew being alive he would not meddle with
any of the affairs of Bohemia, much less with Religion: but immediately after
his Coronation, he going into Moravia to receive homage, the Iesuites erected at
Olumacium a Triumphal Arch, and painted on it among the Arms of Austria,
the Lion of Bohemia tyed to it with a Chain, and the Eagle of Moravia with a
sleeping Hare lying with open Eyes, and this Emblem writ under it, I have pra|cticed.
But the Year following, a new erected Academy of Iesuites spoke out in
Print, that tho Ferdinand at his Coronation took an Oath to the Heretics, yet
first he left it in the Vestry of the Church, that he would not suffer Heretics to
prejudice the Rights of holy Church.
But I believe I may without offending any Candid Papists, say of that
Pope, that when he discours'd as that Letter mentions; the glory of his In|fallibility
shined not out of his Mouth, as Porphry said that Plotinus his Soul
did when he spake.
The Story is trite concerning a Popes Excommunicating a Bishop of his
Church, for owning that there were Antipodes; but there is a sort of greater
Excommunication that any Jesuited Papists are to expect that are the Anti|podes
to ingenuous Mankind, and who make Assertory or Promissory lying to

be venial, or lawful, and that is thus to be excluded from the Communio fide|lium
(tho without the Ceremony of lighting Torches and extinguishing
them), namely, by Gentlemens forbearing to keep them Company, and
esteeming them worse than Publicans or Heathens, and accounting it neither safe
nor honorable to Correspond with the Enemies of Mankind; and this is the
Sentence, namely that of a kind of Civil Excommunication or seclusion from
ingenuous mens Conversation that they are likely to obtain in England after
all their charge and pains in their dernier Resort, and the having seen the
birth of their Plott confounded, and the after-birth of it, namely its Shams
thrown away.
Since No injury wounds so much as a Contempt, and since they by tramp|ling
on our Understandings with More pride than ever Bajazet walk'd over
the dead heads of Christians, affect to try to bring us implicitly to believe
their Shammes, they are to thank themselves for our not giving decent
burial to any of their undecent Plotts, and for the exasperating any Pro|testants
by despising them, and endeavouring to impose on their Understand|ings
as some did on a raw young Country Gentleman, whom one day treat|ing
at a Puppet-shew, they persuaded that the Puppets were living Creatures,
and after he had found out his gross ridiculous misconceit therein, they on
the following day attending him to the Theatre, engaged him to believe that
the Actors were Puppets: I mean, their endeavoring to make us believe that
Sham-Plots were real ones, and that a real one was Shamme.
I shall never wonder at the encrease of the passion of anger incident to
humane Nature even in great and generous Souls, on the occasion of gross
Calumnies invented against them about a matter of weight, when I consider
the Example of the Great Royal Prophet, a Person of a great Understanding,
and of so great Courage, that he was not afraid of Ten thousands of men who set
themselves against him round about, and tho an Host should encamp ogainst him,
his heart would not fear, and a Man that had in his Nature and temper the
Gentleness of a Lamb mixt with the stoutness of a Lyon, and one to whom
the Divine Promise had ensured a Kingdom; and yet was he by the Sycophan|cies
and little Shammes rais'd against him by Saul's great Courtiers, wrought
to so high a pitch of anger, that he did with exquisite forms of imprecation,
and such as perhaps are not to be found in any other Story, frequently devote
those Calumniators to the most dire Miseries his fancy could lead him to ex|press.
But the Cause of his being so highly provoked by those that would
turn his glory into shame, and did seek after leasing, and whose deceitful tongues
used all-devouring words, as he saith to Doeg the Edomite in one of his Psalms,
(and whose tongue he there sayes did devise mischiefs, like a sharp razor working
deceitfully) may be ascribed to the Shammes of his Enemies wounding him in
the most sensible Part, namely the Reputation of his Loyalty to his Prince,
whose Life he spared when 'twas in his power to destroy him, and who was
so far from the use of Shammes against him, that he doom'd the Amale|kite
to dy, that shamm'd himself the author of Saul's death.
And therefore No marvel if the Calumnies of Jesuited Papists attaquing
Protestants in that Case too of their Fidelity to their King, render the passion
of anger in them against those Shams so intense and vehement. And tho
the English Courage or a very little Philosophy would help them to bestow
only a generous neglect on other Calumnies, they can never forget those that
strike at the heart of their allegiance, and consequently of their Religion that
so strictly enjoyns it. Nor if according to the Example of that great man af|ter
Gods heart, who said, Away from me all ye that work vanity, and who would
have No lyer tarry in his sight, is it to be admired if every true English Pro|testant

shall say too, odi Ecclesiam malignantium, and shall feclude all dictators
of Calumny from his company, and banish them home to their own.
And tho the abuse of Excommunication by the Papal Church and Presby|terian
hath been so horrid, that the primitive use of it is in a manner lost and
grown obsolete, yet will that which includes somewhat of the Nature of it
be still kept alive in the World by private persons who practice the Christian
Religion they profess, (and to whom tho the Precepts of the New Testament
have not given that hateful thing to humane Nature in charge, namely to be
Informers, or Promoters, or judicial accusers of any of Mankind, accordingly
as under the Mosaic oeconomy 'twas said, Tu non eris criminator, yet have
they obliged them to withdraw themselves from men of corrupt minds, and desti|tute
of the truth, and not to eat with any one who is call'd a Brother and is a rai|ler,
and to turn away from men that are truce-breakers, and to mark those who
cause divisions, and to avoid them, and to reject a Heretic who is subverted and
self-condemned,) and by men of Cultivated educations and tempers, who va|lue
themselves on the Company they keep, and on it are valued by the
World, and will therefore abandon or excommunicate from their Conversa|tion
such Monsters of men, who have renounced the obligations of humane
society, and who are guilty of Notorious Contumacy in matters that concern the
very Salvation of Souls, and the Safety of Kingdoms. The being staked down
therefore to a Narrower Tedder in Conversation, or being Civilly Excom|municated
from Protestants Company, must by necessity of Nature, in my
opinion, be the fate of our Jesuited make-bates and criminators of Protestants
that have been so unweary'd in raising Jealousies between the King and his
People, and between Protestant and Protestant; and all such that go to part
whom God and Nature and Interest have joyn'd, will probably come at last to
be the derelicts of humane Society when they shall Come to be understood,
and especially when there shall be that good understanding between Pro|testants
here of several persuasions that may be expected to arise from their
having found out the authors of their divisions, and seen how ridiculous Pro|testants
have been in the view of the World while they have appear'd like the
Cat to draw one another through the Pool, and the Jesuits and their Pen|sioners
stood behind undiscern'd, and pull'd the Rope.
My Lord, I know we may justly fear that Popery may during some turbid
intervals gain ground in England, and as the Renowned Historian of our
Reformation hath in a public Sermon Judiciously observed, that Sure none
believed themselves when they say we are not in danger of Popery, and none can
think it but they who desire it.
But without presuming to make my self one of Heavens Privy Councel|lors,
and without pretending to a spirit of Prophecy, I shall on the basis of
the Course of Nature ground this affirmation, That whatever alterations Time
can Cause, yet while the English Nation remains entire and defended from For|raign
Conquest, the Protestant Religion Can never be exterminated out of this
Kingdom, nor the public profession of it suffer any long interruption therein.
I will grant it possible that hereafter under a Prince of the Popish Religion,
Popery may like the vibration of a pendulum among Certain persons have the
greater extent in the return of it, as Becket's Image was by Gardiner set up
in London , with much pomp in Queen Mary's time, after
its being pull'd down in Harry the Eighth's, and himself unsainted, and some
people may undertake devout Pilgrimages hereafter to some such Images and
Reliques as my Lord Herbert saith were in Harry the Eighth's time exploded,
and we may again hear of our Lady's Girdle shewn in eleven several places, and her

Milk in eight, the Bell of St. Guthlac, and the Felt of St. Thomas of Lancaster
both Remedies for the head-ake; the Pen-knife and Books of St. Thomas of
Canterbury, and a piece of his Shirt much reverenc'd by great belly'd women; the
coals that roasted St. Laurence; two or three heads of St. Ursula, Malchus his
Ear, and the paring of St. Edmund's Nails, and likewise the trumperies of the
Rood of Grace at Boxly in Kent, and in Hales in Glocestershire, things name
as trumperies in p. 495, and 496, by Herbert in that History, and as adjudged
to be such by H. the 8th.
And no doubt but the Number of such would be very great, who having
great Summs of Money given them, would be content to offer small ones in
Devotion to such Images; and many Candidates for preferment, among some
that now look big for, and among Dissenters that look big against the
Church of England, would produce Certificates of their Constant good affection
and Zeal for the Roman Catholic Church; and any Legate that came to re|concile
us to the Church of Rome, would be thought by many to have brought
the Holy-Ghost in his Sumpters, th we know what the Inside of Campegius
his was made of.
It is moreover possible that Protestant writers may come not to have that
freedom of the Press that Popish now have, and all the luxury and wanton|ness
and humor of the Press in sending forth innumerable Pamphlets against
Popery, in this Conjuncture, may perhaps prove but like the jollity of a Car|nival
to usher in a long melancholly Lent.
I will grant, that 'tis possible the Writ de haeretico Comburendo being now
Abolished that destroyed so many Protestants by retail, certain bloody men
may find some Invention to destroy them by wholesale, and to something of
that nature Bishop Vshers Prophecy referred, of the Raging Persecution of Pro|testants
yet to come and not lasting, and when their enemies will ipsam saevi|tiam
fatigare: and in the violence of such predicted cruelty not being long
lasting, that great Prelate erred not from the Nature of things more then he
did when he Prophecy'd of an Irish Rebellion Forty years before it hapned,
for that usually happens once in so many years through the force and num|bers
of the Irish within that time outgrowing the English, and their allow|ing
themselves the repossession of their Estates by that time as a Iubile.
I will further grant, that the discipline of our Church (of which I think
the Constitution is the best that the world can shew) may be Crusht, as I said
before, and our Dissenters then in vain wish that they had the tolerabiles in|eptiae
(as your Lordship knows who imperiously call'd them) in the
Room of the intollerable abominations of the Mass; and 'tis possible that di|vine
Iustice and Power may permit the doctrine as well as discipline of our
Church to be supprest totally and finally in this Realm, and that the predi|ction
of that Great Man of God wh since his death has been as generally
styl'd the Iudicious, as Lewis the Iust was elsewhere so vogued (I mean Mr.
Hooker) may impress a deep horror and a too late repentance on us, who in
his 5th Book of Ecclesiastical Polity in the end of the 79th Paragraph p. 432.
of the old Edition, speaking of the ill affected to our Church, saith, By these
or the like suggestions receiv'd with all Ioy and with all sedulity practiced in Cer|tain
parts of the Christian World, they have brought to pass that as David doth
say of Man, so it is in hazard to be verify'd concerning the whole Religion and
Service of God, the time thereof peradventure may fall out to be Threescore and
Ten years, or if strength do serve, unto Fourscore: what follows, is likely to be
small joy to them whatsoever they shall be that behold it. Mr. Hooker did first
print his 5th Book in the year 1597. (the first four of his Polity being be|fore
printed in the year 1594) and so the period of Fourscore Years in his pre|diction
was in the Year 1677.

Th that good man pretended not to be a Prophet, yet according to the
old saying,  i. e. he is the best Prophet who can
guess well, both our Church of England and the Dissenters and Papists too
have found that Mr. Hookers prudence had so much divination, and his divina|tion
so much prudence, that the small joy with which they have beheld the
external face of Religion here since 1677. hath shew'd us that he guess'd
shrewdly.
I have only affirm'd, that humanly speaking, and according to the common
course of nature, Popery cannot be the overgrown National Religion of Eng|land,
but am not ignorant that the sacred Code hath given us instances of Om|nipotent
power punishing even Heavens peculiar people by the Course
of Political and Ecclesiastical Power running out of the common Channel of
the Nature of things, and particularly by a succession of Ten evil Kings one
after another. For th humane Nature is so inconstant, and men generally
so apt to reel from one extream to another, that the World growes as weary
of the prevalence of Vice as of Virtue, and after a long age of Dissoluteness
and Luxury, a Contrary humour reigns as long in the World again, a humour
that then excludes all Voluptuaries from Public Trusts for an Age together;
(and a humour of which I think we now see the Tide Coming in) and thus
ordinarily scarce any Kingdom hath more than two or three good or bad
Princes successively for any considerable space of time; Yet after the Ten
Tribes had made their defection from the Line of the House of David, they
were punish't by a Succession of Ten Kings, and not one good one in the
whole number, th some of them were less ill than others; so that no Mar|vel
if the weight of the impiety of so many successive ill Princes sunk them in|to
the power of the Assyrians: and to this their doom, that passage in the
Prophecy of Hosea refers, which the vulgus of the Scriblers against Monarchy so
Miserably detort and wracke (as I may say) to their own destruction, namely,
I gave thee a King in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath; for the Pro|phet
there had not his Eye on Saul, or on a particular Person, but on the
whole succession of Kings after their Rent from Iuda, from Ieroboam to the
Last under whom the Catastrophe of their Captivity was. Such Kings were
given them by Heaven as were proper Instruments of Divine wrath; and
when they were took away from the Stage, 'twas that other worse might
enter and make their Condition more Tragical.
But secret things belonging to God, I pry not into the Book of Fate, but Con|fine
my sentiments alone to the Book of Nature.
In an Excellent Sermon of the Dean of St. Pauls, 'tis with great Piety and
Prudence said, We have liv'd in an Age that has beheld strange Revolutions,
astonishing Iudgments, and wonderful Deliverances.
What all the Fermentations that are still among us may end in, God alone
knowes.
I only as a Philosopher Considering that the Properties of humane Passions
have as Necessary effects in Minds, as gravity or lightness have in Bodies,
and that let men intend what male administration they will, things will not
be ill administred, do think that the fermentation now in the Kingdome will
not end but with Popery it self here ending. And that I may not seem to stand
alone in this my opinion, I shall entertain your Lordship with that of An Ex|cellent
Philosopher and Divine, the Author of the History of the Royal Society,
who there having said, that experimental Philosophy will enable us to provide
before-hand against any alteration in Religious affairs which this Age may pro|duce,
he goes on thus, If we Compare the changes to which Religion has been al|wayes
subject with the present face of things, we may safely conclude, that what|ever
Vicissitude shall happen about it in our time, it will probably be neither to

the advantage of implicit Faith, nor of Enthusiasme, but of Reason: the fierce|ness
of violent inspiration is in good Measure departed: the Remains of it will be
soon chaced out of the World, by the Remembrance of its terrible footsteps it has
every where left behind it.
And although the Church of Rome still preserves its Pomp, yet the Real au|thority
of that too is apparently decaying. It first got by degrees to the Tempo|ral
Power, by means of its Spiritual, but now it upholds some shadow of the Spi|ritual
by the strength of the Temporal dominion it has obtain'd. This is the pre|sent
state of Christendome: It is impossible to spread the same Cloud over the
World again.
The Vniversal disposition of this Age is bent upon a Rational Religion. And
therefore I Renew my affectionate request, That the Church of England would
Provide to have the chief share in its first adventure, that it would persist as
it has begun to encourage Experiments which will be to our Church as the Brit|tish
Oake is to our Empire, an Ornament and Defence to the Soil wherein 'tis
planted.
This Author therefore with such Vigour of Reason passing his sentence
concerning any Vicissitudes here not happening that will probably Conduce
to the advantage of Popery or Enthusiasme, I hope your Lordship will acquit
me both of Singularity and Enthusiasme as to the opinion I have given, espe|cially
since I only profess it to be founded on Natural Reason, and do only
Consider the God of Nature, when I think that a Religion that is of God will
stand.
'Tis not unknown to Your Lordship, that Columbus being in chace of the
New World, and Cast among some barbarous Ilanders that deny'd him the
hospitality of their Port, and freedom of Commerce, he Knowing that they
worshipt the Moon, and that it would shortly be Eclips'd, th he was neither
Prophet nor Prophet's Son, aw'd them out of their inhumanity, by foretelling
that the Moons deity would be shortly obscur'd: and when ever I acquaint
any Roman Catholics with my Judgment of the Nearness of their Religion
to an Eclipse, I intend no more enthusiasme in my prediction, then Columbus
did in his, and design nothing worse neither by mine then he by his, namely
the reconciling them to humanity and a fair entercourse with Mankind.
'Twas in the middle of the Worlds long night of barbarisme and ignorance
that Popery was in its Meridian, and for hundreds of years all the Learning
that busy'd the World referr'd to Iudicial Astrology, Rabinical Resveries,
School-Divinity, Latine Rhimes in praise of the Saints, Compiling of Legends,
to Monks Histories of Ecclesiastical affairs, and the times they liv'd in (but
so partial and so full of ridiculous and incredible Stories, that we have a bet|ter
and truer account of the times when Alexander and Iulius Caesar liv'd,
then of the times of Constantine and Charlemain) to gelding of the Fathers
writings, and purging away their Gold, Regulating the Hoods, and Hose, and
Shoo's of Monks, to inventing of Ceremonies and mystical vestments, and fan|tastic
geniculations, to the making of the Popes brutish Canon Law, and the
Commenting thereon in barbarous Latine by Doctors of the Decrees and De|cretals,
and to the Commenting on Aristotle by those that could not read his
Text, and the Commenting likewise on the New Testament by such as knew no
Greek (insomuch that 'twas then a proverbial saying among those illiterate
Writers, Graecum est, non potest legi) to quiddity, esseity, entity and such titi|vilitium,
and to eus rationis, that did (as I may say) destroy the being of
Reason, to the improvement of one sort of Mechanics, Viz. by making Images
in Churches with little engines and librations turn the eyes and move the lips
like the forementioned Rood of Grace at Boxley in Kent (and which was by
Bishop Fisher exposed as a cheat at St. Pauls Cross at the time of its being

there broke in pieces) while their great Real Design was to make the Layety
but the Churches automata, as brute Animals may not improperly be said to
be God Almighties, to the Composing Paschal Epistles about the time of the
Celebration of Easter, a Controvery (as our great Mr. Hales saith) that
caused as great a Combustion as ever was in the Church, and in which fantastical
hurry all the World were Schismaics, and about which Monk Austin was so
quarrelsome with the Britains, when the difference was not in doctrine but in
Almanac Calculations, and about which ater the infallibility of the General
Councel of Nice had given a Rule in the Cause, the World was yet so much in
the dark, that the Bishops of Rome from year to year were fain to address to the
Church of Alexandrias's Mathematicians for directions as to the week Easter
was to be kept in.
And during this long night, Millions of mankind were brought into the
World only to sleep out their span of time, and to have day-dreams of
Knowledge, or rather a profound Docta Ignorantia; and men were by dig|nities
rewarded proportionably for their sleeping longest: according to what
the Chronicon Frideswidae mentions of Guimundus a Chaplain to our King
Henry the First, who in the Celebration of holy offices reading before the
King that place of St. Iames, non pluet super terram annos III,  menses VI, thus
ridiculously distinguished the Notes in his reading, non pluet super terram, an|nos,
unum, unum, unum,  menses quinque unm, and the King asking him af|terward,
why he red so, he answered quia vos in ita tantum legentes beneficia
 episcopatus Confertis.
No marvel then if during that long gross and palpable Darkness of the
World, the Pope travesty'd those words in Scripture about Gods making the
two great lights, to serve his turn against the Emperor, th yet the attempt to
prove the Popes Supremacy out of the first Chapter of Genesis, is as extrava|gant
as his who would prove the Circulation of the blood out of the first Chap|ter
of Litleton.
And as the Roman Breviary tell's us of S. Thomas very gravely, that when
once he was vehement in prayer before a Crucifix at Naples, he heard this
voice bene de me scripsisti Thoma, none likewise in that age laught at the Pope
for saying bene de me scripsisti Moses. The world then brought no quo warranto
against the Popes Charter derived thus in his Canon Law from Moses, nor
that gloss on it which says Since the Earth is seven times bigger then the Moon,
and the Sun eight times bigger then the Earth, the Papal Power must Conse|quently
be fifty seven times bigger then the Regal dignity.
Our English World will no more allow of the logical Consequence of that
doughty argument of Bellarmine (Lib. 1. de Pont. ca. 2. sect. denique,  sect. sed.)
There is one King among Bees, therefore there ought to be one Commander, chief
Teacher and visible Monarch in the Vniversal Church, then they would allow
that argument of the Bees to give our neighbour Monarch a right to an Vni|versal
Temporal Monarchy. The Popes vociferating of that Text Behold
two Swords, and while their adherents held so many Thousands in their hands,
might then pass muster for as good an argument of his right to Spiritual and
Civil power, as the words, that the Lillies spin not, did for the Salic Law with
the help of another Army then one of Commentators.
The Renewall of the Popes Charter by Pasce oves, was not then disallowed
either for the fleecing of many Millions of Christians or killing some hundreds
of thousands in the German Empire, according to what has been observed by
the famous Erastus in his Theses, p. 72.  propter excommunicatos Imperatores
 Reges, aliquot Centena millia hominum trucidata sunt in imperio Germa|nico.

And perhaps the Popes plea for making the World a great Slaughter-house,
might then be admitted by the authority of the Text, Arise Peter, kill and
eat.
Conculcabis super aspidem  basilicum then went for a claim of Divine Right,
to make the head of the World to be trampled on by the foot of a bald-pated
Fryar.
But if the Papacy, the light that was in the World then was darkness (as the
Scripture Expression is,) How great was that darkness!
And as the Popes continued art was then to Conceal Nature, so 'twas not
then held tanti for art in others to be Curious in following Nature, when an
Opinion was imbibed that the Pope could change the very Nature of things,
according to that saying, I have been shewn in the Canon Law, glo. in C.
proposuit. de Conc. praeb. c. 5. de trans. ep. Papa mutare potest rerum substan|tialia
 de Iustitia injustitiam facere, mutando  Iura corrigendo, ade qua|drata
aequare rotundis et rotundis quadrata.
And for my part, I should not have repined at the Popes assuming to him|self
the honour of the light that rules by day, if he could have illuminated the
World with the demonstration of the quadrature of the Circle, which that gloss
pretends to; a great Knowable thing, as Aristotle said, tho not known, and which
secret all the penetrating Mathematicians from Archimedes down to Mr.
Hobbs, have wooed with very great passion and could not enjoy.
But during the Egyptian plague of darkness that many Ages then lay under,
our famous Countreyman Wicliff alarm'd the Lethargic World: and he as|sail'd
several gross Errors of Popery with its own weapons of Metaphysics and
School Divinity, and by means of the noise his Two hundred Volumes made
in the World, he dispers'd a great terror in that dark Age; and as one saith,
Sir Iohn Old-Castle, Lord Cobham and the Lollards being awaken'd out of
their first sleep, were desirous to rise before it was day, and before the appointed
time was Come for the Reforming the abuses in the Church: and between that
time and morning, most men fell asleep again as fast as ever: but yet long be|fore
the dawn of the Reformation, the doctrine of Wicliffe had made such a
fermentation in our English World, that in the Year of our Lord 1422, that
great States-man Chichley Archbishop of Canterbury, in a Letter to Pope Mar|tine
the Fifth, Complain'd, That there were then so many here in England in|fected
with the heresies of Wicliff and Husse, that without force of an Army they
could not be supprest: Whereupon the Pope sent two Cardinals to the Arch-Bishop
to Cause a Tenth to be gather'd of all Spiritual and Religious men,
and the money to be Laid in the Chamber Apostolic; and if that were not
sufficient, the residue to be made up of Chalices, Candlestics, and other imple|ments
of the Church, as the Acts and Monuments Attest.
And it is not unknown, that long before, viz. in Harry the Fifth's time,
Chichley foreseeing that a Storm was coming from the Commons on Church-Lands,
diverted it, by engaging England in its darling popular War with
France, and caus'd the Clergy to contribute very liberally to it.
But that fermentation that Chichley said could not in the Year 1422 be
checkt in peoples Minds otherwise then as aforesaid, soon out-grew the power
of any Army to allay; for in less than Thirty years afterward, the Invention of
Printing came into the World, by which one man could transmit more
notices of things in a Day, then another could by writing in a Year, and which
did as much out-do the publication of notions by the Goosquill, as the
invention of Gun-powder did the killing Force of the gray-goose-wing, and which
did, as it were, revive the old Miracle of the Gift of Tongues, (and Cloven too I
may Call them, for their being divided from the Sentiments of the Papal
Holy Church) and made Learning begin to fly like lightning through the

World to the Controuling and detecting of the Popes Excommunicating
Thunder, and which shew'd the World its true face in the stream of time,
and shew'd the greet Fisherman of Rome dancing in the Nett, and which was
the true speaking Trumpet, whereby a single Author could preach to the dio|cess
of the World.
And that great birth of Fate the taking of Constantinople within three
years after the Invention of Printing, occasioning the World's acquiring the
knowledge in the West that it lost in the East, and dispersing the Learned
Greeks, Theodore Gaza, Iohn Lascaris, Manuel Chrysaloras, and many others
to teach the Greek Tongue where they went, the Press was thereby fur|nished,
with Glad tidings for the Curious World, and Erasmus, and many
learned Papists, did soon imbibe the knowledge of that learned Language,
and he complained in a Letter to the Archbishop of Mentz, That the Friars
would fain have made it Heresy to speak Greek.
So pleasant was it then to consider that that barbarous Generation instead
of knowing Heresy to be Greek, voted Greek to be Heresy, and that they
who had murdered so many thousands for being Heretics, knew not what
the very word in its original language imported.
The Sagacity of Erasmus could not then but easily see through the Cobwebs
of the School-Divines: totam Theologiam a Capite usque ad Calcem retexuerunt,
 ex divina Sophisticam fecerunt aut Aristotelicam, saith he in vit Hier. prae|fix
ipsius operibus. And Doctor Colet the Dean of St. Paules, (whom Erasmus
often in his Epistles calls praeceptorem unicum  optimum) did as Erasmus
saith in his life, account the Scotists dull Fellows and any thing rather then in|genious,
and yet he had a worse opinion of Aquinas then of Scotus. And tho
Luther had angred Harry the 8th. by speaking contemptibly of Thomas
Aquinas whom that King so highly magnifyed that he was call'd Rex Thomisti|cus,
Collet was not afraid to Pronounce in that case as Luther did.
And here it may not by the way be unworthy of your Lordships observa|tion
as to the concert that is between the Genius of one great Witt and another,
that Erasmus and Mr. Hobbs had the same sense of School-Divinity and School-Divines:
For Mr. Hobbs in his Behemoth or History of the Civil-Wars speak|ing
of Peter Lombard and Scotus saith, That any ingenious Reader not knowing
what was the designe of School-Divinity (which he had before siad was with
unintelligible distinctions to blind Men's eyes while it encroach'd on the
Rights of Kings) would judge them to have been two the most egregious block|heads
in the World, so obscure and sensless are their Writings.
The New Testament was no sooner open'd and read then in Erasmus his
translation and in the English Tongue, but the Popes Cards were by the
Clergy that playd his game thrown up as to all claim of more Power here
by the word of God then every other forreign Bishop had; and both our
Universities sent their judgments about the same to the King, which me|thinks
might make our Papists approach a little nearer to us without fear of
infection; for we allow the Bishop of Rome to have as much Power by the
Word of God as any other Bishop; and 'tis pitty but that Judgment of our
Universities were shewn the World in Print, and sent to the French King, and
particularly the Rescript or Iudgment of the University of Oxford as not be|ing
any where in Print (that I know of) but in an old Book of Dr. Iames's
against Popery.
Cromwel the Vicegerent to H. the 8th. had (as Fuller saith in his Church-history)
got the whole New-Testament of Erasmus his translation by heart: but
the sore Eyes of many of the Clergy were so offended with the glaring-Light
the New-Testament in Print brought every where, that instead of Studying
it as that great Primier Ministre did, they only study'd to suppress it: and

thus Buchanan in his Scotch History saith that in H. the 8ths time, antaque
erat caecitas ut sacerdotum plerique novitatis nomine offensi, eum librum a Marti|no
Luthero nuper fuisse Scriptum affirmarent ac vetus testamentum reposcerent
i. e. They look'd on the New-Testament as writ by Martin Luther, and call'd for
the Old Testament again.
And the truth is, if Luther had then set himself to have invented and
writ a model of Doctrines against Iustification by works, and redeeming our
vexation from wrath divine by Summs of Mony, and against implicit Faith
and many gross Papal Errors, he could not possibly have writ against them
in terminis terminantibus more expresly then the Writers of the New-Testa|ment
did.
But the New Testament was then newly opened, and the legatees permitted
to read the whole Will over translated into a language they understood, after
they had been long by fraud and force kept out of their legacies by the Bi|shops
Court of Rome, whose Artifice had formerly in effect suppressed that
Will: and that inestimable legacy of liberty from all impositions humane
being particularly shewn to Mankind, there was no taking their Eyes off
from this Will, nor taking it out of their hands, nor suppressing the study
of the Greek language it was originally writ in.
King Harry the 8th. had received his Legacy thereby, who before was but
a Royal Slave to the Pope; and the triumph of an  was eccho'd round his
Kingdom, like that of Archimedes, when he had detected the Imposture that
had mingled so much dross in the Sicilian Crown.
'Tis true he retained the profession of several Papal Errors, and such as he
being vers'd in School-Divinity knew would still keep themselves in play in
the World with a videtur quod sic,  probatur quod non, accordingly as the
learned Dr. Iones has observ'd in his Book call'd the Heart and its Right So|vereign,
that Image-Worship, Invocation of Saints, Transubstantiation, Pur|gatory
are and will be learnedly and voluminously defended on each side to the
World's end.
Harry the 8th therefore did in his Contest with the Papacy Ferire faciem,
and did fight neither against small and great but the King of Rome, as I may say.
He attaqued the Pope in his claim of authority over all Christians, the autho|rity
that Bellrmin calls Caput fidei, the head of the Catholic Faith.
'Tis therefore very well said in a Book call'd Considerations touching the true
way to suppress Popery in England, Printed for Mr. Broome in the Year 1677;
Whatever notions we have of Popery in other things, the Pope himself is not so fond
of them, but that to gain the point of authority, he can either connive, or abate, or
part with them wholy: though no doubt he never doth it but insidiously, as well
knowing that whatever consession he makes for the establishing his authority, he
may afterward revoke, c. And so the Author saith, p. 12. That Harry the
8th for having cast of his obedience to Rome was therefore judged a heretic, and
that was look't on by Rome as worse than if he had rejected all its errors together.
He was a thorough Papist in all points but only that of obedience, in comparison of
which all the rest are but talk.
I account therefore in Harry the 8ths time Poperies most sensible and vital
part, viz. the Popes supremacy did end in England per simplicem desinentiam.
The radical heat and moisture it long before had was gone: like a senex de|pontanus
it was held useless in a wise Senate. He establish't the doctrine of his
own supremacy without a Battel fought, nor did any Rebellion rise there|upon
but what he confounded with a general Pardon.
Many of the Scholars of the University of Oxford did mutinously oppose
the introducing the knowledge of the Greek Tongue there, and were there|upon
call'd Trojans, and others of the Schollars were as rohust and loud for

that Language, who were therefore called Graecians: but by a Letter wit by
Sir Thomas More to that University and by the Kings Command (which Let|ter
is extant in the Archives of the public Library there) the Schollars being
admonished to lay by those names of distinction, and likewise all animosity
against the Greek Tongue, and to encourage the learning of the same, it
was there at last peaceably receiv'd.
The day-break of learning then in the world had put a period to the
night of ignorance in which the Beasts of Prey had domineer'd, and to their
Monastic denns themselves. The enlighten'd part of mankind was weary of
growing pale among papers and sometimes red hot with arguing about terms
of art (and all those barbarous too, that had formerly hid the God of na|ture)
and would no longer account implicit faith the only justifying one, and
could not more esteem the imposing of such a blind faith commendable that
was made previous to mens quest after pabulum for their Souls, then that
practice of the boy of Athens who did put out the eyes of birds, and then expose
them to fly abroad for food.
The Learning then introduced into the world shew'd that the hierarchical
grandeur of the Roman Church was not extant formerly in the learned times
when the old Roman Empire flourish'd, but was contrived in the times of
ignorance between the Bishops of Rome and the Leaders or Princes of the
Barbarians, and that it had its beginning from the Inundations of the Nor|thern
people (so that with Mr. Colemans leave by the way, Popery may be
call'd too a pestilent Northern heresy) and that to the end that those Barbarians
might not find out the original of the papal power, and see how narrow the
stream of it was at its fountain when every Bishop was call'd Papa (as
every woman is now with us call'd Madam and Lady) that the Pope by af|fronting
the Emperors power effected a strangeness between the Greeks and
Latines, by means whereof the Barbarians being brought up in prejudice
against the Graecians neglected their Language, to the decay whereof in the
world not only the decay of the purity of the Latine Tongue may be impu|ted,
but also of History, Geography, Geometry, skill in antiquity, and even
the worlds not knowingly then conversing with the Latine Fathers.
It was in an age of non-sense when a Canonist venturing to be a Critic told
the world concerning the Greek word Allegoria, istud vocabulum fit ex duobus
vocabulis; ab allo, quod est alienum,  goro sensus; and when an old School|man
Thomas de Argentina, thus gave the derivation of latria, istud vocabulum
fit ex duobus vocabulis,  La, quod est laus,  tria, quod est trinitas: quia la|tria,
est laus trinitatis. But the very understanding of two ordinary
Greek words, namely , equal priviledges in ecclesiastical matters
to the Bishops of Rome and Constantinople allow'd by a General Councel, that
were obvious to every enquirer into history, did quite blow up all pretences of
the Popes supremacy; and one versicle in that long unknown Greek Book 
viz. Luke 24. 47. which shews, that the teaching of Repentance and remis|sion
of sins in the name of Christ by his own order began at Ierusalem, did sur|prize
thinking men with amazement, when they heard a Pope and General Coun|cel
calling Rome the Mother and Mistress of all the Churches, and anathematising
all who think otherwise, and saying further extra hanc fidem nemo potest esse sal|vus,
for this the Trent Councel did.
Thus then the abolition of the papal power here brought the world at the
first step out of a blind Chaos into a Paradise of Knowledge, and help'd Chri|stians
to demonstrate to themselves and to Jews, and Pagans the truth of the
Christian Religion, for the certainty of the doctrine of which during that
time of papal darkness the world had only the assertion of the present age
that call'd it self the tradition of the Church; but by the introduction of the

Greek Tongue and other learning, Christians had the sense of the Greek and
Latine Fathers, and those historical Records that brought down to them the
certainty of the Miracles that were wrought in the founding of Christianity;
from the Primitive Christians, who saw them. 'Twas the restoration of learning
in general, help'd them to say with Tertullian fidem colimus rationalem, and with
St. Paul, I know whom I have believed, and without the introducing of humane
learning, the Protestant Religion could no more have been advanced to its
height in the world, then men can be perfected in Astronomy without the
knowledge of Arithmetic. Luther came into the field arm'd with the Know|ledg
both of the Greek and Hebrew Tongues, when he was to contest with the
Errors of the Papacy; and he having for his Antagonist Cardinal Cajetan,
who was the Legate in Germany and an eminent School Divine, and who
made a home thrust at Luther out of the Scripture according to the Vulgar
Latine translation, Luther told him in plain terms, That that translation,
was false and dissonant to the original: and hereupon the Cardinal, th he
and the Papacy too had one foot in the grave, Catolike fell eagerly on the
studying of Greek, that he might be able so confute Luther and his followers
out of the Scriptures, and was put to it to make his weapon when he was in
the field.
And can any one think now that in this present state of England, when we
see so many that are Critical Masters of Experimental Philosophy, and who
by means of the great useful pains formerly taken by Erasmus, Sir Thomas
Moore and others, in restoring Philological Learning, have now entire lei|sure
to devote their Studies to the substantial Knowledge of things, and
whose Motto is, Nullius in verba, and who know, that if they would have
every one trust them, they must take nothing on trust from any one;
and who know, that since truth doth always sail in sight of error, they must all
the way go sounding by experiment; I say, can any one think that it was
less easie for the Sun to go back Ten degrees on Ahaz his Dial, then 'tis to
make this Age run back to implicit faith and ignorance and barbarisme?
And is it to be thought that men who weigh Silver in Scales, will not
weigh Gold; I mean, not examine notions of Religion with care, when they
are so cautious in others? Can we think that men who will not part with
those Notions that salve the phaenomena, will quit those that save their Souls,
and especially considering the proverbial addiction of the English genius to
Religion, and considering too, that men by long use and Custom have been
habituated to the profession of a rational Religion, and that it can plead
here a hundred years prescription?
It is certainly more easie to unteach men the use of the Sea-Compass in Na|vigation,
then the use of Reason in Religion; and the inclination of the
Needle to the North, is not likely to be more durable then the tendency of
mens affection in England to the Northern heresy so call'd; and it is more ea|sie
to teach all Mankind the use of Letters, then to unteach it to any one
man; and when the temper of an inquisitive Age is like a Trade-wind carry|ing
men toward Knowledge and toward a rational Divinity, they may by
some accidents be made to cast Anchor, or they may be sunk, but they can|not
be forced to go back.
When a man hath long been compell'd to creep with Chains on him
through a toilsome dark Labyrinth, and having extricated himself out of it
and being come to enjoy his liberty in the light of the Sun, the persuasion of
words cannot make him go back again.
My Lord, I lately mentioned the Motto of the Royal Society of England,
of which your Lordship is a Member, and I look on the very constitution of
that Society to be an inexpugnable Bulwark against Popery: In which Society

many of our choice English Witts have shew'd as much subtilty and curiosity
in the Architecture of Real Science, and such as tends to the edification of
the world, as any of our Countrey men heretofore did in those curious but
useless Cobwebs of holy Church call'd School Divinity.
And the constitution of that Society hath not only been useful in encrea|sing
the Trade of Knowledge among its members by a joyned stock, but
moreover hath tended to the raising in the Kingdom a general inclination to
pursue Real science, and to contemn all science falsly so call'd: and the Rai|sing
of this inclination I will call a Spirit that can never be Conjur'd down,
nor can the knowledge that depends on number, weight and local Motion,
be ever exterminated by Sophisms or Canting, or terms of Art; Nor will they
who have from this Society learned to weigh Ayre, give up their Souls to any
Religion that is all Ayre without weighing it, or (notwithstanding any hard
name that may come to be in vogue) ever forget that bread is bread.
His Majesty by the founding of this great Conservatory of knowledge
presently after his Restoration (wherein his great Minister then the Earl
of Clarendon, was an honourable Member) did convey real knowledge and
a demonstration of his being an Abhorrer of Arbitrary Power, to all that
can understand Reason, and affect not the ridiculous Treasonableness of Brad|shaw's
Court, to say, that they will not hear reason; for had he like the Ea|stern
King's affected Arbitrary Power, he would have used their artifice
of endeavouring to cast mists before the understanding faculties of his
Subjects, and to detain them from knowledge by admiration, and to de|prive
them of sight, like horses that are still to drudge in the Mill of Go|vernment
by blind obedience; But to shew that he abhorr'd both such obe|dience
and implicit Faith, and that he intended to establish his Throne as well
in the heads as in the hearts of his Subjects, he presently setled this Great
Store-house of Knowledge, that shew'd it was his desire and ambition by the
general Communication of Knowledge in his Dominions, to Command
Subjects whose heads were with the Rays of Science crown'd within.
And therefore I think His Majesties Munificence to the Royal Society in
giving them Chelsey-Colledge at their first institution, was very Consistent
with the Primary Intention of the erecting that Colledge, which was to be a
Magazine for Polemical-Divinity wherewith to attaque the Writers for Popery:
for the very planting of a general disposition to believe nothing contrary to
Reason, is the cutting of the gras under Poperies feet; and His Majesty
providing for the growth of reason did apparently check the growth of Po|pery,
as well as of Arbitrary Power, without the prop of which, Popery
can never run up to any height more then the Sun-flower without a supporter:
and the setling in men an humour of Inquisition into the truth and nature of
things is, as I partly said before, an everlasting barricade against the Popes
darling Court of the Inquisition.
That great and noble notion of the Circulation of the blood, took its first
rise from the hints of a common persons enquiring what became of all the
blood that issd out of the heart, seeing that the heart beats above Three
Thousand times an hour, th but one drop should be pump'd out at every
stroke: and if any one shall tell me that he believes that Popery with its reti|nue
of implicit faith and ignorance can over-run us, I will ask him what
will then become of all that knowledge the vital blood of the Soul, that
hath issued from the heads of inquisitive Protestants, and been Circulating in
the World for above a Hundred and Fifty years, and I doubt not but it will
be in mens Souls as long as blood shall have its Circular Course in their bodies;
and maugre all the Calumnies cast on the Divines of the Church of England
for being fautors of Popery, I shall expect that our learned Colledge of Physi|cians

will as soon be brought to disbelieve the Circulation of the blood, of
our Royal Society to take down the Kings Standard that they have set up
against implicit faith, as our learned Convocation the learnedest that ever
England had, be brought to believe the principles of Popery.
I know, My Lord, 'ts obvious against this my hypothesis, of the unpra|cticableness
of Popery being here the State-Religion, to say that in little
more then Twenty years time Four great changes in Religion happen'd in
England, and that the generality of the people then like dead Fishes went
with the stream of the Times: but I ask, if the generality of the people
had been throughly enlighten'd in the rationality of the Protestant Princi|ples
Twenty years together, would they have return'd to the belief of the
Popish? Will they now do it after the establishment of a Rational Religion for
above a Hundred years together? Can Popery now find the way into most
Mens brains here presently after the whole Nation almost were Preach|ers,
and when all our great and little unruly disagreeing Sects yet agreed in
this as a fundamental, that the Bishop of Rome is the Antichrist? If Print|ing
had been free in Turky for a Hundred years, and a libera Philosophia
and Theologia had been there in fashion for a Hundred years, and every man
had been allow'd his Judgment of discretion so long about the sense of the
Alchoran, or of the holy Scripture, and of all Books of Religion, could ig|norance
even there come into play again? or if the Turkes had drank Wine
for a Hundred years together, could any one Conjure the glasses out of
their hands by telling them there was a Devil in every grape?
If that Law in Muscovy that makes it death for any Subject to travel out
of that Kingdom without the Emperors Licence, lest his Subjects having
seen the freedome of other Countreys, should never again return to the Ar|bitrary
Power in their own again; I say, if that Law had been repeal'd for
a Hundred years, and multitudes of oppress'd mankind had thence found
the way to breath in the ayre of Liberty like men, could they be persuaded
to return to the Yokes of Beasts again?
When a floating Island has been a Hundred years fixt to the Continent,
can any teach it to swim again? Consulitur de Religione, is likely to be the
eternal business of England, and in case of a Prohibition to any mans little
Court of Conscience in that cause, he will certainly give himself a consul|tation.
The very humour of the English Nation long hath and still doth run against
what they think but like Popery, or makes for it, and that with such a ra|pid
current of Antipathy, as is never likely to be stem'd: and nothing is
more out of fashion then a kind of Sir-positive, or Dictatorian humour in
common discourse; much less then will a dogmatical Popes infallibility ever
be digested here, while he makes himself a St. Positive.
The gentile humour of the Age here that abhorrs hard words as loathsom
pedantry, will never be reconcil'd to one certain long hard word in Popery;
namely Transubstantiation; nor to another namely Incineration, or burning
men for not understanding the former word (according to the style of the
Historian, Imperator aegr tulit incinerationem Johannis Husse) and people
will account their Protestant Bibles more agreeable to them then the English
one published by the Colledge of Doway, where the Translator studied for
hard words in the room of plain ones, as for the Passeover, phase, for foreskin,
praepuce, for unleaven'd bread, azyms, for high places, excelses, and other
such words we have in the English Rhemish Testament, viz. exinanite, para|sceue,
didragmes, neophyt, spiritualness of wickedness in the Celestials.
In our Busy English world while men are most yary after profit and plea|sure
and the study of things, if very few or none can be brought to learn

the universal real character, and which would tend to the propagating Real
Knowledge among the Nations of the World (accordingy as the excellent
propounder of it in Print with great modesty saith in his Epistle dedicatory,
that he had slender expectation if its coming into common use) our Ingeniosi or
Witts (which all men pretend to be now, as they did in the Late times to
be Saints, tho yet as few are Witts now, as were Saints then) will not care for
troubling their brains with the studying of the Religion whose pretended uni|versality
appears but a kind of universal character, and not real, and tending
to obscure the knowledge of things in the World.
If they should see here a Religion that was full of pageantry, and seem'd to
be wholly theatrical, they would think it was as much their birthright to
censure it, as 'tis to be eternal talking Critics in the Pit to damn Playes, and
would think two Supremes in a Kingdome to be of the low nature of two
Kings of Branford, and rather then part with their money and stake down
their Souls for seing such a Moral Representation of an absolute spiritual and
absolute temporal power on the stage of the Kingdom, they would be too apt
with Mr. Hobs to thrust the whole Nation of Spiritual Beings out of the
world; I mean rather then they would be to their faces cheated and harras'd
by a spiritual power: and our people inspir'd with witt as well as those
with the zealous spirit of Religion would cry out, conclusum est contra Ma|nichaeos;
I, and against the Schoolmen too, I mean our Romanist Manichaei
who make two summa Principia in every State.
In this age where the lower or Sixth rate Witts do so over-value them|selves
on turning every thing into ridicule, the Mass would have here a Re|ception
according to what the gloss in the Canon Law observes, that when a
place had layen long under an interdict, the people laughed at the Priests,
when they came to say Mass again. Nor would any Papal interdiction unless it
could interdict us from the use of Fire and Water be of any moment. The
World would now laugh at any Prize that should be play'd between the Two
Swords, the very glossator on the Clementines saying occasionly that resipiscen|te
mundo, the World being grown wiser, there must be no longer striving
for both Swords. And any one that would obtrude on us gross exploded er|rors
in Church or State will appear as ridiculous as St. Henry the Dane, who
as the Martyrology mentions, when worms craul'd out of a corrupted Vlcer
in his Knee put them in again.
My Lord, I will further offer it to your Lordships consideration, That if
it be found so hard to keep up the external polity of the Church of England,
th in it self so rational and so meriting the name of , after the
Twenty years discontinuance of it, insomuch that Dr. Glanvile in the first
page of his Book call'd the Zealous and impartial Protestant, hath these
words, the first occasion of our further danger that I shall mention, is the
present diminution, not to say extinction of Reverence to the authority of the
Church of England, c. (and he p. 4. writes largely to that Effect,) what quar|ter
can Popery expect here from an Age of sense and reason when it should
break in upon both, after the forementioned Hundred years discontinu|ance?
According to the foresaid Argument of the Bees for the Popes spiri|tual
Monarchy, we see it improbable for him ever to bring us to a Rendevouz
in his Church again; for the sad experience we have had of the Sects here
that left the Hive of the Church of England, not gathering together into
any one new Hive, but dividing into several swarms and hives, and never
returning to the old, may shew the Hive of holy Church how little of our
Company 'tis to expect.

Having said all this about the mists of Popery, being to contend with
knowledge in its meridian, I think I shall comply with the measures taken
by our Philosophers in this Critical Age, in founding their observations upon
Experiments, if I further add, that the former Experiments England hath had
of Poperies being pernicious to its external Polity and Grandeur, will per|petuate
and heighten the fermentation in the minds of our angry people
against it.
All our Monkish Historians do attest the experience our Kings had in be|ing
bereav'd of great Sums of Money, while they enrich'd the Pope here
by giving him the Office to keep the Theological Thistle, which he Rail'd
in with so many censures and distinctions, and non obstantes, that our Kings
could not pass to their Palaces but by his leave, and on his terms.
An English King then was but the Popes Primier Ministre, and yet paid
great wages too for the being a Servant to the Servus Servorum.
King Iohn used to say, That all his affairs in the World were unprosperous,
and went cross and untowardly after he had once subjected himself and his King|dom
to the Church of Rome: His words were, Postquam me  mea Regna
Romanae subjec Ecclesiae, nulla mihi prospera, omnia contraria advenerunt.
And 'tis obvious to consider on the other hand, what a great figure Henry
the Eighth made in the World, after he had manumitted himself and his
Kingdoms from the Papal Usurpation: And how he held the Balance of the
World in his hand, and trod on the Basilisc of the Papal Supremacy, and
notify'd it to the Nations of the Earth that England is an Empire, that being
the Style of the Statute of the 24th of H. 8. c. 12. Viz. That this Realm is
an Empire, and that the Crown thereof is an Imperial one: And the words
of Kings and Emperours of this Realm, being then attribued in our Statutes to
the Monarchs of England; and as the great expression in the Prophesie of
Ezekiel c. 16. v. 13. is applyed by God to the Iewish state, And thou didst
prosper into a Kingdom, it may be justly said that Harry the Eighth's defy|ing
the Popes Usurpation, made England prosper into an Empire. 'Twas his
doing that made him hors de page, and 'tis only the doing it that will make
the French King truly so too: For 'tis only Air that any feed a Monarch's
fancy with, who would amuse him with an Vniversal Empire abroad, till he
hath obtain'd one first at home; as no Man is to expect to govern his Neigh|bours
Family, who is Control'd in his own.
And like a Master who imagines himself great, while he is feared by none
but some of his own Servants, so how little terrour did Queen Mary's Reign
give to any parcel of Mankind, but a few of her own Subjects, of which the
number that she burnt and made to languish in Prisons, and such as left her
Kingdom by migration to forreign parts, would easily have kept Callais
for her, and prevented the ignominy of her Politics, in losing the Real
Key of France, while she was finding the Imaginary Keys of the Church!
But 'tis a truth not contestable, That Queen Mary's Reign (in which her
persecution of her Subjects was so barbarous, and such a scandal to Govern|ment,
That Dr. Heylin himself applyes to it in the Title Page of his History
of Queen Mary that passage in Paterculus, Hujus temporis fortunam, ne de|flere
quidem quispiam satis digne potuit, nemo verbis exprimere potest) served
only as a foile to the lustre of Queen Elizabeth, whom all Generations since
have called blessed; and who was not more lov'd by the English, then she
was feared by the French, and was offered Calice if she would but have con|nived
at the continuing of the French forces in Scotland, and who sent to
the great Henry the Fourth a Mandamus to build no more Ships, and had
more money offered her by her Subjects then she would accept; and yet
(as is said in Towsend's Historical Collections) had spent a Million of Money

in her Wars with Spain, and laid out 100000 l. to support the King of France
against the Leaguers, and 150000 l. in defence of the Low Countries, and dis|charged
a debt of Four Millions she found the Crown indebted in. Nay, our
Historians tell us, that She payed the very Pensions that were in arrear in her
Father's, and Sister's time to divers of the Religious persons ejected out of
Ab|beys.
It was Queen Elizabeth who by all her Alliances, and especially her Of|fensive
and Defensive one with the States of the Vnited Provinces in the
Year 1578. laid such a deep and sure foundation for a vast trade of the Eng|lish
Nation to be built on, that it's overbalance is said to have brought to be
Coined in the Tower of London, from the first of October 1599, in the 41st
Year of her Reign, to March 31st 1619, (being 19 years) 4,779, 314 l. 13 s.
4 d, And from March 31st 1619, to March 31st, 1638 (being 19 years)
6,900,042 l. 11 s. 1 d, And from March 1638, before May 1657 (being
19 years) 7,733,521 l. 13 s. 4 d; England alone by verture of that her
Alliance, having till the Peace of Munster 1648, enjoyed almost the whole
Manufacture, and best part of the Trade of Europe: And it was but just for
Heaven to punish in England the greatest villany that could be wrought on
Earth, I mean the murder of the best of Kings, by suffering the Trade of Eng|land
to have its fatal decay in that year 1648. For then, I count, our over|balance
of Trade for the last mentioned Nineteen years had its Period, and
'twas by the effect of that Peace that both Holland and France, and Spain can|tonized
the power of our Trade, and the most Soveraign of our Manufa|ctures.
Till that black year 'twas to be ascribed to the result of Queen Eli|zabeth's
politics, and not to the conduct of the Long Parliament, that Eng|land
did, as to Trade, both do its business and play, and as to its Command|ing
the Trade of the World, did Sail with a Trade-wind; and during that
Wind, it could not happen that any should meet us, or overtake us in our
motion, whatever mean Pilots were at the Helm.
It was for the completing the last ternary of the Coinage, that I mentio|ned,
the , or nineteen years, ending in 1657. For I believe that
both Astrea and Trade left our Land in that fatal Crisis of 48, of which the
Mnth of Ianuary produced the Signing of that Peace at Munster, and the hor|rid
Arraignment, and Martyrdom of that matchless Prince.
'Tis therefore not to be admired, That Queen Elizabeth's provident Ensu|ring
such a plenty of Traffick and Riches to her Kingdom, both for her own
and future time, she had what praemium of Taxes from her Parliaments she
pleased, accordingly as King Iames tells the Parliament Anno 1620, That
Queen Elizabeth had one year with another above 100000 l. in Subsidies; and
in all my time I have had but four Subsidies, and six Fifteenths; and he said his
Parliament had not given him any thing for Eight or Nine years.
England did thrive apparently while it was to Queen Elizabeth, a Puteus
inexhaustus: But while it was such an one to the Pope, was in a miserable
and consumptive state, as any one must necessarily conclude, who considers
that the nutritive juyce of the wealth of the Kingdom was diverted from che|rishing
its own Head to pamper the Bellies of Forreigners. Deplorable
then was the condition of the English Crown, when (as we are told by the
Antiquitates Britan. f. 178.) in the Reign of Hen. 3d. Repertus est Annuus
reditus Papae talis quem ne Regius quidem attigit: And when according to
Matthew Paris f. 549, in the Reign of that King, Anno 1240, it was complai|ned
of, That there remained not so much Treasure in the Kingdom, as was in three
years extorted from it by the Pope.
But what is more strange, we are told in Cotton's Collections p. 129 of
the times of Edward the Third, That the Taxes paid to the Pope for Ecclesia|stical

dignities did amount to five times as much as the People paid the King
per annum. One would wonder that so martial a Prince, the Scene of
whose Reign lay almost in continual War, should be so careless of the Si|news
of it, as to permit so much of the wealth of the Kingdom to be mis-applyed,
and that too while all manner of Experiments of Taxes were tryed
on his Subjects, who payed him toward his charge of the War with France
Wool and Grain, as not having Mony enough to supply him wholly there|with:
and when, as it is said in Cotton's Collections, A long Bill was brought
in by the Commons against the Usurpation of the Pope as being the Cause of All
the Plagues, Murrains, Famine and Poverty of the Realm, so as thereby was
not left the third Person, or Commodities within the Realm as lately were, and
the Commons did desire that it might be enacted, That no Mony might be car|ried
forth of the Realm by Letters of Lombardy, or otherwise on pain of forfei|ture
and imprisonment.
But the Pope knew, it seems, there was mony to be had out of England,
though the Commons grudged it him, and that a complaint of the Com|mons
of the decay of Trade was no proof of it, but rather in his case an in|dication
of the contrary, for that 'tis Proverbial with Rich Men when they
have no mind to part with their mony, to say, they have none; and it appears
out of a balance of Trade on Record in the Exchequer, that in the 28th year
of Edward the Third, the Sum of the over-plus of the Exports above the Im|ports
amounted to 255214 l. 13 s. 8 d.
This however shews sufficiently the Indignation of a Popish House of Com|mons
at the Pope and his Lombard-street Bankers, who convey'd his mony
for him hence by Bills of Exchange; and if our late Parliaments have not
thought fit to comply with the demands for satisfaction of Protestant Ban|kers
there, much less will future ones favour any of the Popes Lom|bards.
That the Pope formerly had as much mony here from the publick as the
King, we may well believe possible, since 'tis generally held that Wolsey's Re|venue
equalled Harry the Eighth's.
Matthew Paris tells us, Anno 1240, Misit Papa Pater noster sanctus quen|dam
exactorem in Angliam Petrum Rubeum, qui excogitata muscipulatione in|finitam
pecuniam a miseris Anglis edoctus erat emungere. i. e. Our holy Father
the Pope sent an exactor Peter Rubeus into England, who with a kind of Mouse|trap
trick ped the poor English of infinite Sums of Money. And the expres|sion
of Wiping the English of infinite Sums of Mony was in fashion among all
eminent later Writers of ours against the Papal Usurpation: and 'tis parti|cularly
used by Parker in his Antiq. Britan. where he saith, Praeterea indul|gentiarum,
dispensationum, similium fraudum immens copi infinitis pecuniis
Anglos emunxerunt.
Nothing less then infinity of Treasure out of one Island could supply the
great exacter of Rome, who it seems resembled him that Cicero brands by say|ing,
infinitum genus invenerat ad innumerabilem pecuniam Corripiendam. But
there is now no catching a Nation in Mouse-traps.
As the Pope has never thought it worth his while to send Emissaries to
Denmark and Sweden, and some other Northern Countreys, to spunge Mony
out of them, which he knows that great spendor called War that so general|ly
infests them, makes them have none to spare for the Popes use (and Curia
Romana non vult ovem sine lana) so will the future vast charge too likely to
be for ever incumbent on England, and other parts of the World, in pro|viding
and maintaining Capital Ships, effectually provide against the profu|sion
of any on the Projector of Religion at Rome, and against Romes being
to us as Matthew Paris called it of old, barathrum proventuum.

And any who considers that his Majesty hath not without difficulty
obtain'd Supplies of Mony from late Parliaments, and that they
have been all appropriated to certain publick uses, may well give the
Pope City-security, that he shall have no Mony from England; and no Man
I think now supposeth that any thing that time can cause, can make the Pope
get much Mony out of the Exchequer of England, but one who (as Charo
says) was born in a Bottle, and never saw the World but out of a little hole.
But if according to the Calculations that have been by some made, the cur|rant
Coin of the Nation doth not now exceed Six Millions; and the pub|lick
Revenue in times of Peace has amounted to somewhat near one Third
of that, and if the Pope should be allow'd here to have a spiritual income equal
to the King's, and the restored Abbots and Monks, and the other Clergy be
allow'd another Third, (for so the accounts of their proportion were totted by
some Critical Calculators) the whole Laity would be nichil'd, as the Exche|quer
word is.
King Edward the First, as the Antiq. Britan. mention, sent some of his
Courtiers to treat with the Clergy about the Quota of their supplying him,
viz, Misit ex aula su Nuntios qui suo nomine agerent cum clero, quoniam eorum
 tranquillitas Major  fructus atque reditus annui tunc essent longe uberiores
quam populi, ut ad Regem in his bellicis angustiis adjuvandum se ostenderent
promptiores. And it appears out of Cotton's Collections, That in the fourth Year
of Richard the Second, The Clergy confess'd they had a Third part of the Reve|nue
of the Kingdom, and therefore then consented to pay a Third part of the Taxes.
But in those ancient times of Popery beside the Clergies share in the Bal|lance
of Land, it might be justly added to the Inventory of their Wealth, That
they generally engrossed the highest and chiefest Offices in the Kingdom, and
that from the Office of Lord High Chancellor, to that of the very Clerks in
Chancery. and other Clerks places (whence to this day the officiating Registers
of Courts are called Clerici or Clerks) whereby they caught in a manner
the whole Kingdom in a Purse-net.
'Tis therefore no wonder that the great affluence of the Riches of the
Clergy drew to them that Popular esteem, that (as the Antiquaries observe)
the English word Sir was affixed to the Christian Names of Clergy-men, from
King Iohn's time down to the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, and which was
also express'd in Latine by the word Dominus, as for example, in the witnes|sing
of a Deed, Testibus Domino Willielmo de Massy, persona de Bowden,
Matheo Hale, c. And of the people calling their Parish Priests by the name
of Sir William Massy, and the like, as in ordinary Communication we call
Knights, we have the instance of the first Christian on whom here for his Re|ligion
incineration was practised, viz. Sir William Sautre, Parish Priest of the
Church of St. Scythe c. in London in Henry the Fourths time: for so he is
Styled in the Acts and Monuments.
Bishop Sanderson who in his profession of Divinity was greater then any
praise, was likewise so accurate an observer of the weight of what he affir|med
in the Pulpit, though it was not of a point of Theology, that every
thing he there said has a Title to be regarded: And he in his Sermons in fol.
ad Populum, on 1 Cor. 7. 24. pag. 195, and 196, speaking of the Monks, saith,
It is well known in this our Land, how both Church and Common-Wealth groan'd
under the burden of these heavy Lubbers: The Common-wealth, while they be|cam
Lords of very little less (by their computation who have travelled in the
search) hen one half of the temporalties of the Kingdom: and the Church while
they engrossed into their hands the fruits of the best Benefices of the Realm, al|lowing
scarce so much as the Chaff to those who tread out the Corn.

This profession is God be thanked long since suppressed: There is nothing of
them now remains but the rubbish of their Nests, and the stink of their memo|ries,
unless it be the sting of their Devilish Sacriledge, in bbing the Church
by damnable Impropriations. He had before said they were , and
Slow-bellies, Stall-fed Monks and Friars, who liv'd mew'd up in their Cells, like
Boors in a Frank, pining themselves into Lord, and beating down their bodies
till their Girdles crackt.
But though it hath been truly observ'd, That the not providing for the
augmentations of the poorer Livings in England, was a scandal to our Re|formation,
in that it made so many scandalous Livings, and consequently
so many such Ministers, and it has been in one of Queen Elizabeth's Par|liaments,
notify'd by Dr. Iames (as Townsend's Collections mention) that of
Eight Thousand and odd Parish-Churches then in England, but Six Hundred
did afford a competent Living for a Minister: And it has been publickly
aver'd by Archbishop Whitgift, That there were Four Thousand Five Hun|dred
Benefices which are not worth above Ten Pound a Year in the King's
Books; yet the dispersing of so much of the Church Revenue among the
Laity hath had this effect, namely, to engage the possessors of so great a
proportion of the Land of England to be Champions against Popery; and
one other good effect within my own observation it produced in the late
times, when Tithes themselves were thought Delinquent, namely, that the
Impropriate Tithes saved the others: And the not augmenting the poorer sort
of Livings (the which mostly were in Cities and Corporations in the Coun|trey)
hath not however prov'd any augmentation to the interest of Popery:
For though the Reliques, and Images, and Shrines of Saints there, that
brought a concourse of Offerers and Offerings thither enrich'd those pla|ces,
and the Churches, and had the effect of Staple Ecclesiastical Commodities,
and Harry the Eighth's abolishing them, reduced the value of the Livings
there almost to nothing, they grew by occasion thereof afterward to be
receptacles for heterodox Divines, who seiz'd on the Livings there in a man|ner
derelict, and finding the Genius of Trading people averse from Ceremo|nies
did represent the few and innocent, and indeed decent ones of the Church
of England as odious to them, and therefore were sure of pleasing their au|ditors
by constant declaiming against those of Popery, that were so many,
and cumbersome, and had caused so much blood-shed, and were known to
be Ceremonies both mortuae mortiferae.
And as Doleman alias Parsons observed in his time, that the strength of the
Puritans lay in those Corporate Towns and Cities, there will the hatred
of the Principles of the Papists probably for ever encrease.
I have for this purpose found it truly observed in a Discourse in octavo,
concerning Liberty of Conscience, Printed for Nath. Brooks at the Angel in
Cornhil: That the Puritan Preachers by their disesteem of Ceremonies and ex|ternal
Pomp in the worship of God, were the more endeared to Corporations,
and the greater part of persons engaged in Trade and Traffic, who hate Ceremo|nies
in general, and what does unnecessarily take up time: And that persons
who nauseate Ceremonies in Civil things, will loath them likewise in Religious,
as a man who has an antipathy against Muscadine in his Parlor, cannot love
it at the Sacrament. And that if we reflect on those who did most love Cere|monies
heretofore in our Nation, we shall find them to have been persons of the
greatest Rank and Quality (who did effect Ceremonies in Civil things) or of
the poorest sort, who did get their daily bread by the Charity of the other. So
natural is it for men to Paint God in Colors suitable to their own fancies, that
I do not wonder at Trading Persons who hate Ceremonies, that they thus think
God in respect of this hatred altogether such as themselves.

That Discourse had before set forth, That 'tis natural to Men, who live by
Trade and whose being rich or beggars depends much on the honesty of their Ser|vants,
to be enamo on that Preaching that is most passionate and loud against
what looks like luxury, and is apt to occasion unnecessary expences to them:
And therefore no humane Art will ever Reconcile them to one Casuistical
Tenet that is so so branded in the Pope's said Decree of the second of March,
viz. Servants of either Sex may secretly steal from their Masters, for the va|lue
of their service, if it is greater than the Salary which they receive.
The Mystery of Iesuitism, letter 6, pag. 80, cites for this Tenet Father Bau|ny's
Summary p. 213, and 214 of the sixth Edition, viz. May Servants who
are not content with their Wages advance them of themselves, by filching and
purloining as much from their Masters as they imagine necessary to make their
Wages proportionable to their services? On some occasions they may, as when
they are so poor when they come into service, that they are obliged to accept any
proffer that's made to them, and that other servants of their quality get more
elsewhere.
At the rate of this Moral Theology no Tradesman knows what Mony
he has either in his Pocket, or Compter, or what Cash in his Closet, nor in|deed
any King what Treasure he has in his Exchequer.
But notwithstanding the aversion of many persons of high Birth and
Breeding, and who are lovers of Pomp and Ceremony in matters Civil, and
likewise in Religious, from the contrary humour of Trading Men, yet is
there one thing that hath and always will (in spight of all differences in
Religion) occasion an entercourse of Civility between the former Class of
Mankind here, and the latter, and 'tis, that necessity of nature that makes
the Borrower a Servant to the Lender, namely, that the expensive former
Classe taking up Mony at interest from the more frugal latter, obligeth them
to give the Lenders the respect of fair quarter: And thus according to that
Bull in Tacitus, That in some parts of Scotland the Sun shines all night long,
there will still during the contrariety of their tenets, and humours, and
which are as opposite as light and darkness, occasionally arise a clear under|standing
between them.
And of the Redundance of Money, the Puritans party had in the late
times, and of their designed employing it for the greatning the interest of
their party, the establishment of Feoffees by them for purchasing Impropriati|ons,
is a great instance: Of their great progress wherein we have an account
in Pryn's Compleat History of the Tryal of Arch-bishop Laud, where he saith,
And had they not been interrupted in this good work, they would probably in
very few years have purchased in most of the great Towns and noted Parishes Im|propriate
in England in Lay-mens Lands: And which had they effected, they
might have settled such a Bank of Land on the Fond whereof to have brought
into their possession the greatest part perhaps of the mony Currant in Eng|land,
and that party without any but Silver weapons, have acquired such
an arbitrage of the interests of all others in England, as to have usurped Har|ry
the Eighth's Motto of Cui adhaereo praeest.
But though the Livings in these great Corporate Towns are so small, and
the value they had by oblations be evaporated every where but in the King's
Books, (where it remains still to enhance their payment of first Fruits and
Tenths) the heterodox Divines there find Harvests of oblations rich enough,
and so will the Divines of the Church of England, if ever a storm of Po|pish
Persecution shall drive them there for shelter to be Pastors of the Mo|nied
Men; and if the worst comes to the worst, they will there find
some at gathered Churches better then lean Bishopricks, (as perhaps some
heterodox Pastors do now there experiment them) and the ambient heat of

State-favour that call'd out some of the inward one of Religion, being aba|ted,
they will probably grow more exemplary in austere vertue, and there|by
attract so much reverence from their flocks as to become Confessors, as
well as Preachers to them, for so the Non-conformist Divines there now
in a manner are; and as Confession under Popery proved the only Guaranty
to the Priests for their being paid their Personal Tithes, and as then people
at their deaths expiated their omissions in the payment of their Tithes, by
valuable Legacies, thus too will it probably happen to the Ministers of Christ's
New Testament, and often, to be Executors, or at least Legatees in Christians
Wills; the very dust of whose feet is thought beautiful by all Men, gene|rally
when their return to their own dust is approaching.
And the persecution design'd them will but reduce their state in the Eye
of the World, to look and be like that of the Primitive Christians, who
made the Apostles their Bankers, and the depositaries of their wealth; and
whose Successors likewise in the administration of the Gospel during the
following Ages of Persecution had good livelihoods, on the Fond of Obla|tions.
And as for Tithes we hear nothing of them for many Ages in the Pri|mitive
Church. In the Codex Canonum Ecclesiae Universae published by Iu|stellus
(the most authentick Book in the World next the Bible, and which
contains the Canons received by the Universal Church till the year 451)
there is not one word of Tithes. The Clergy were then liberally main|tained
by the free oblations of the people, which were called :
And there was no such Proverb heard of in the World abroad as laci semper
sunt infensi Clericis, till there was another unlucky one, Ecclesia peperit divitias
c. and till the Goths and Vandals being Proselyted to Christianity exprest
the natural zeal of new Converts by vastly endowing the Clergy  Lands,
who had (as I may say) setled Heaven upon them, and whoe gre pro|portion
in the balance of Land necessarily made them aterward one of the
Three Estates in the Christian World. And most worthy of Christian
Princes care it was to endeavour to secure the profession of Christia|nity
in future times as well as their own, by providing that the Clergy
should not be of the meanest of the people, nor depend on benevolence; which
in the prosperous condition of Christianity might perhaps grow cold, as
under Popery the Charity of Oblations had done, but for the Atifices be|fore
mentioned of Saints, Shrines, c. and Reliques, and the fear of Purga|tory.
Of the Oblations of the people here in England decreasing toward the
Pastors of Independent Churches, when Independency became the Darling
Religion of the State, we had an indication in the late times, when some of
the most eminent of them obtain'd the possession of great Livings and their
Tithes, and others of them retreated from their Churches to Headships of
Colledges. Nor has there been any failure of the return of the old Exube|rance
of Oblations from such Churches to such Divines, who have again re|turned
to them when they were dislodged from those preferments.
I find not that the Piety of our Ancestors had established any Revenue to
the Church from Tithes in England, till about the end of the Eighth or
middle of the Ninth Century; nor was the division of England into Parishes
before the time of Honorius Archbishop of Canterbury, in the year 636, till
which time there could not be Parochial Tithes. About that time as 'twas
said that the measure of donations to the Church was immensitas, so was the
modus of their Artifices to preserve them sine modo, it being incident to hu|mane
Nature, to be restless in the acquiring of riches, for without the per|petual
acquiring of more, no Man is sure to preserve the Quota of what he
hath.

'Twas thence that Sacriledge of the Monks arose, that tore the Bread out
of the Mouths of the Parish Priests by the Name of Appropriations, which
shewed the President to Wolseys alienation of Religious Houses, that was the
President to Harry the Eighth's. And it may well be supposed that the De|sign
of the Monks in robbing the Parochial incumbents by Appropriations,
was to propagate ignorance among the Laity thereby, and to leave the Age
as dark as they found it, or rather to be able generally to let in or keep out
what quantity of light they pleased.
Yet had those Appropriations been made in an Age of knowledge, they
would then have met with that Nick-name of Impropriations, that was born
many years afterward: and it would then have appeared improper to all
that the Monks should Muzzle the mouth of the Ox that did tread out the
Corn; and that old natural Zeal for Religion, so anciently radicated in Eng|lish
minds, that Popes have formerly complained they were addrest to with
more questions about Religion from England than from all the World be|side,
would have inclined the respective Parishioners according to their abi|lities
to contribute a liberal maintenance to their Parish Priests; and even in
St. Paul's words, To have plucked out their own Eyes, and have given them,
but that they saw that devotion that brought the fore-mentioned con|course
of Spectators, and Offerers to the Images and Shrines, and to the Al|tars
there made the Vicars at least competently to live by the Altar.
And if that Classe of heterodox Pastors in Corporations who as to skill in
Theology and the Encyclopaedy of Arts and Sciences, requisite to Crown a Di|vine,
are generally but Images in comparison of the excellent Divines of the
Church of England, have been how ever so much adored there, and had such
offerings from their adorers, the substantial and learned Divines of our Church
there, may on occasion well say, quid non speremus?
During that late persecution of the Divines of the Church of England in
the times of the Usurped Powers, who therein exercised all the cruelty they
durst, it might be truly said of the Doctrine of that Church, and the fire
of the zeal of the Laity in providing for the liberal maintenance of many of
its Clergy, as it is of Lime in the EmblemMediis accendor in undis.
What burning and shining lights then in the midst of a perverse Generation
were among others of the Church of England in London, Bishop Gunning,
Bishop Wild, Bishop Mossom? Nor did their numerous Congregations in the
least, for want of plentiful Oblations to them, starve the Cause of Religion.
The last forementioned person at the Funeral of Bishop Wild, in a Printed Pa|negyric
of his Life, takes occasion to speak of the Oblations in those times
afforded him, and saith, p. 7. And whereas some good Obadiahs did then hide
and feed the Lord's Prophets, it was his care to Communicate to others what
himself received for his own support. Many Ministers sequestred, many Widows
afflicted, many Royalists imprisoned and almost famished, can testifie the dif|fusive
bounty of his hand, dispensing to others in reliefs of Charity, what himself
received of others in offerings of Devotion.
And as if that Iron Age had been the Golden one of the Church of Eng|land,
he doth so pathetically represent the internal glories of that Church
in that conjuncture, that any one who would draw an Historical Painting
of the State of the Primitive Church to the exactness and bigness of the life,
might best do it by the Church of England sitting in that posture he de|scribes.
These are his words, p. 6, And here I cannot but recount with joy
amidst all this Funeral sorrow, what were then the holy ardours of all fervent
devotions, in Fastings and Prayer, and solemn Humiliations: Ay, in Festival
and Sacramental Solemnities. O the lift up praying, and yet sometime down cast
weeping Eyes of humble Penitents! O the often extended, and yet as often en|folded

arms of suppliant Votaries! Vpon days of Solemnity, O how early and
how eager were the peoples devotions, that certainly then, if ever, the Kingdom
of Heaven suffered violence, so many with Jacob then wrestling with God in
Prayer, not letting him go till he gave them a blessing, c.
Thus was that great Magazine of Learning and Piety Dr. Hammond in
the late time of the Persecution of the Church of England, the Magazine
then likewise of mighty Alms, insomuch that Serenus Cressy saith, in his Epi|stle
Apologetical Printed in the year 1674, p. 48. Dr. Hammond in those
days inviting me into England, assured me I should be provided of a conveni|ent
place to dwell in, and a sufficient subsistence to live comfortably, and withal,
that not any one should molest me about my Religion and Conscience. I had
reason to believe that this invitation was an effect of a cordial Friendship, and
I was also inform'd that he was well enabled to make good his promise, as having
the disposal of great Charities, and the most zealous promoter of Alms-giving
that liv'd in England since the change of Religion.
Thus while as noble Confessors they forsook Houses and Land, they accor|ding
to the Evangelical promise, received the effects of Houses and Lands,
and praedial Tithes an hundred fold in this Life, with the Gospel Salvo
(as I may call it) of Persecutions: And as in the primitive and best times,
when the Christian Pastors had no Tenths but the Decumani fluctus, or Ten
Persecutions, and many Christians were decimated for Martyrdom, that Com|munity
of Goods that was never read of to be practised but in Vtopia,
and that Renunciation of that dear thing called Property, (for the defence
whereof Political Government is supposed to have been chiefly invented)
did so much glorifie the Christian Morality, to the confounding all exam|ples
of the most sublime Morals of the Heathens, that the Pastors had the
Christians All at their Feet, and did tread on Oblations at every step they
took, so likewise those great Divines beforementioned, and many others,
found that Primitive Temper, revived in some of the Lay-Members of the
Church of England by their generous Offerings and Contributions, which
adorn'd the Gospel, and supported its Ministers, and which Laity, though
cruelly decimated by the Usurpers, yet were then Rich in good works, ready
to distribute, and willing to Communicate, and by their forementioned great
liberality in Oblations, exceeding the rate of Tenths, did lay up in store
a good Foundation against the time to come for the Pastors that shall be
their Successors in Persecution, that may secure their expectations of good
Pastures in our Cities, and of having a Table prepared for them in the pre|sence
of their Enemies, come what can come from Popery.
Moreover by such an accident only can the great Cities in England be freed
from some illiterate Pastors of gather'd Churches, who without having their
Quarters beaten up by Penal Laws, will disappear there, when the excellent
try'd Veterans of the Church of England shall come to Garrison them. Those
little Sheep-stealers of others Flocks will then no longer attempt there to
have Common of Pasture without Number, but will by all be numbred, and
found too light. 'Twill be visible to all that the Divines of the Church of
England can with ease Preach in as plain a manner as the other, and that
the other can not, with pains, Preach as Learnedly and Rationally as
they.
We see that many ridiculous Lay-Preachers, who in the late times did
set up a kind of Religion-Trade in great Cities, and did gather Churches,
and likewise gather there some maintenance, have thence silently took their
march on the occasion of the more Learned Presbyterian Divines ejected
from their Livings, retiring thither, and there having constant auditories,
partly resembling the guise of gathered Churches: And the disproportion

in intellectual Talents being generally as great between them and the Di|vines
of the Church of England, as is that between them and the Lay-Preachers,
they must there prove Bankrupt necessarily as the others
did.
Dr. Glanvil in his Book called, The Zealous and Impartial Protestant, did
but right to the Episcopal Clergy of England, when he ascribes to them the
honour of having by their Learned Writings Confuted, exposed, triumph'd
over the numerous Errours of Popery, and there names Bishop Iewel, Bishop
Morton, Bishop Andrews, Archbishop Laud, Bishop Hall, Bishop Davenant,
Archbishop Vsher, Archbishop Bramhal, Bishop Taylor, Bishop Cozens, Dr.
Hammond, Mr. Chillingworth, Mr. Mead, Dean Stillingfleet, Dean Tillotson,
Dean Lloyd, Dr. Henry More, Dr. Brevint: And speaking of the Episcopal
Clergy of the City of London, saith, How many Learned, Substantial, Convi|ctive
Sermons have they Preach'd against the Popish Doctrines and Practice since
our late fears and dangers? 'Tis true, some few others have written something,
Mr. Baxter and Mr. Pool have laboured worthily: Dr. Owen hath said some|what
to Fiat lux, and there are some Sermons of the Presbyterians extant, Mor|ning
Lectures against Popery: these are the most, and the chief of their perfor|mances
I ever heard of.
The Conjuncture of the few and evil days of Popery would occasion ano|ther
good effect, a thing that is always to be wished, but (considering the
general present ferment in Mens minds, and pass'd mutual exasperations)
never else to be hoped for, and that is this the common Calamity would
cause such an Union between Protestants of several perswasions in Religi|on,
as would put a Period to that dreadful state of dissension among them,
which has so much horrour in it, that all those subtle miscreants who have
been able to cause it here, and make so many of them almost ready with
the ferity of the canes sepulchrales to devour one another, can never in words
express. Nor can my imagination paint out to me any thing of the kind
like it in the past course of time, without my recollecting the description
of the fears of the Doctor of the Gentiles, given by himself concerning the
State of the Church of Corinth, to which he applies the words of debates, en|vyings,
wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults, and with|out
my considering the fermentation in the City of Ierusalem when near its
fatal destruction. But there will be a finalis concordia among the now im|placable
Protestants, if ever Popery should set up to be the State-Religion:
And then any one who will give advice to a Painter to draw The present
state of the Protestant Church of England, may make a good Copy from the great
Original of that Prophesie in Scripture, The Wolf and the Lamb shall feed
together, c. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Mountain, c. And
perhaps without going so far for a Mountain that may represent to ones
fancy that State of English Protestants, he may find one in England to do
the work, one that several of our Historians speak of, telling us that in the
Year 1607, When by the Irruption of the Severn Sea, the Country in Somerset|shire
was overflown almost Twenty Miles in length, and Four Miles in breadth;
it was then observ'd that Creatures of contrary natures, as Dogs and Hares, Foxes
and Conies, yea Cats and Mice getting up to the tops of some Hills, dispensed at
that time with their antipathies, remaining peaceably together without sign of
fear, and without any violence used toward one another.
Nor do Men in great Towns supposed qualified only as the Children of
light, but as the Children of this World, and as wise in their Generations, and
as projecting their own wealth, and the encreasing of their Trade, and of
the value of their Rents, by eminent Oblations provide for such Divines plan|ting
there; and 'tis obvious to every thinking Man, that the erecting of

Free-Schools, and encouraging excellent Divines to live in any particular
Town, turns sufficiently to Mens account in this World as to the ends afore|said
by attracting inhabitants. For it will be natural to Christians there,
when they do not barely hear of a Christ Transubstantiated into a dull Wa|fer,
but see one (as I may say) Transfigured and shining as the Sun in the
Preaching of the Gospel, to say Lord it is good for us to be here, and for
them there to make Tabernacles, and provide Oblations not for dead but li|ving
Saints; and as a living Dog is more valuable then a dead Lyon, so I believe
that in any times of Popery here that can come, any one Corpora|tion
and a holy learned Divine of the Church of England, will get more by
one another, then all Towns where Shrines and Images of dead Saints shall
be set up, will mutually gain thereby.
Then will the Clergy and People being benefactors to each other be natu|rally
ready to pray for each other, and the former being believed from their
hearts to say O Lord save thy people, will find both an Oral and Cordial
Response from the latter, And bless thy Clergy.
But while I am thus accompanied by the Guide of Natural reason, tra|velling
in the Region of future time, the time that only is the object of
humane sollicitude, and from which anxious minds are too apt to fear that
every days birth may be a Monster,: I have by considering the former
Revenue accruing to the Church by Oblations, took occasion to Corrobo|rate
my great affirmation, of its not being naturally possible for Popery to
exterminate the Protestant Religion in England, a Religion that Popery can
never take by assault, or making of its professors Martyrs, nor yet by Siege,
in starving its Pastors.
'Tis true, that such a great impost as Popery may occasion to Protestants
by Oblations, may in one sense seem to have the nature of a punishment,
namely, because 'twill not be a burden to which all Subjects, or indeed all
Protestants will be equally liable, and it will chiefly light on the devouter
sort of Protestants: And in like manner it may be said that the gain that
arose from Oblations in the times of Popery to the Parish Priests of great
Towns, was in effect an unequal impost on the Popish Laity, as being a
Tax only on the more Ignorant and Superstitious of them. But any one
who has in the least considered matters of State cannot but know that any
great inequality of Taxes, that lights on the Subject as a mischief, doth
prove to the Prince an inconvenience, to whom the Subjects pressure makes
him unable to afford that Subsidium he otherwise could, and perhaps would
cheerfully for the Publick safety. Thus may the great supposed charge to
be incumbent on the more devout Protestants by Oblations, probably tempt
them to use all the means the Law will permit, to render the Government
of a Popish Prince uneasie to him, and certainly disable them from paying
in that proportion toward the public Levys upon emergent occasions, they
else might do.
It may therefore here be affirm'd, that the gain of Popes arising from In|dulgences,
which was so vast, that Popes would boast That they could never
want  while they could command Pen and Ink, and which Klockius in his
Book de Contributionibus observes, did yield the Pope in Common Years
a hundred Tuns of Gold, i. e. a Million of pounds Sterling, (and which being
an unequal Tax on Papists, and not pressing the debauchees of that Religion
but only falling heavy on the more Pious and devout sort, made them the
less able to supply the holy See with mony on extraordinary occasions,
or to pay their Taxes due to the Popish Princes they lived under, and par|ticularly
those due to the Pope as a Temporal Prince) has since in a manner
dyed a natural death, the light of Learning having no sooner come into

the World, then that poor Hermit Fryer Martin Luther scourged the Popes
Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, with as much ease almost as our Savi|our
did the Iewish.
Any one who shall consider the burden of Oblations, that the devoute
Roman Catholicks in England lye under, as to their Priests (which we may
suppose to be very heavy, according to Mr. Iohn Gees account in his Book
called The foot out of the Snare, p. 76, where he saith, That the Popish Pastors
ordinarily had a fifth of the Estates of the Laity allowed them, and that he
knew that in a great shire in England, there was not a Papist of 40 l. per an|num
but did at his own charge keep a Priest in his house; some poor neighbours
perhaps contributing some small matter toward it) may well think our Laity
will bid as high for English Prayers, and for Wares they understand, and
see, and weigh, as the Popish Laity doth for Latine ones, and Merchandize
they are not allowed to examine; and he who considers that the Priests of
that Religion, though thus pamper'd with Oblations, yet knowing them
burthensom to the Laity, do feed themselves and them with hopes of the
Restitution of Tithes to holy Church, and even of that sort of Tithes
alien'd from it in the times of Popery, may reasonably conclude that our Di|vines
whenever forced to fly to the asylum of Oblations, will be restless in
being both Heaven's and Earth's Remembrancers, of their claim of Tithes ap|propriated
to the Protestant Religion by the Laws in being, and that a vio|lent
Religion, and illegal Gospel will be but a Temporary barr against the
collecting of Tithes, from a Land only during an Earth-quake.
I shall here acquaint your Lordship with a passage in the late times re|lating
to the Clerical Revenue in England, worthy not only your knowledge,
but posterities, and that is this: A Person of great understanding, and of
great regard of the truth of the matters of fact he affirmed, and one who
made a great figure in the Law then, and in the Long Parliament from the
beginning to the end of it, related to me occasionally in discourse, That
himself and some few others, after the War was begun between the King and
Parliament, were employed by the Governing party of that Parliament to nego|tiate
with some few of the most eminent Presbyterian Divines (and such whose
Counsels ruled the rest of that Clergy) and to assure them that the Parliament
had resolved, if they should succeed in that War, to settle all the Lands, Issues
and Profits belonging to the Bishops and other dignitaries upon the Ministry
in England, as a perpetual and unalienable maintenance, and to tell them that
the Parliament on that encouragement expected that they should incline the
Clergy of their perswasion by their Preaching, and all ways within the Sphere of
their Calling to promote the Parliaments Cause; and that thereupon those Divines
accordingly undertook to do so: And that after the end of the War, he being minded
by some of those Divines, of the effect of the Parliaments promise by him notified,
did shortly after signifie to them the answer of that party, who had employed
him in that Negotiation to this effect, viz. That the Parliament formerly did
fully intend to do what he had signified to them as aforesaid, and that the pub|lick
debts occasion'd by the War disabled them from setling the Bishops Lands
on the Church: But that however he was authorized at that time to  them,
that if it would satisfie them to have the Deans and Chapters Lands so settled,
that would be done: And that then those Divines, in anger reply'd, They would
have setled on the Ministry all or none: representing it as Sacrilege to divert
the Revenues of the Bishops to Secular uses, and that thereupon they missed both,
the Deans and Chapters Lands being sold.
Those Divines it seems had a presension that the prosperous Condition
of their Church, would diminish the Charity of Oblations, and therefore
did not impoliticly try to provide for the duration of their Model, by di|viding

both the Bishops Power and Lnds among their Clergy: And no
doubt but in the way of a fac simile after this Presbyterian Copy, the Popish
Priests will in concert with the Pope, even under a Popish Successor as well as
now, combine to lessen the King's power, and advance the Pope's, on promises
from the Holy See, that they shall have the Church Lands restored to them.
And I doubt not but a Popish Successor will support a Popish Clergy with
what maintenance he can, having a reference to the Law of the Land, and
likewise to the Law of Nature that binds him first to support himself; and
perhaps by keeping vacant Bishopricks long so (a thing that by Law he
may do) he may have their Temporal ties to bestow on whom he shall
please, and perhaps by issuing out new Commissions about the valuation of the
Clerical Revenue, a larger share of First-fruits and Tenths legally accruing to
him, may enable him to gratifie such Ecclesiasticks as he shall favour. But
as I likewise doubt not that ever any accident of time will leave the dispo|sal
of such a great proportion of the Church Revenue at his Arbitrage as the
Usurpers had at theirs, so neither do I of his affairs ever permitting him to
allow so large a share of that Revenue to his Clergy as the Usurpers did to
theirs, whom as those Powers durst not wholly disoblige (and therefore
unask'd settled on them toward the augmentation of their Livings the Impro|priate
Tithes belonging to the Crown, and to the Bishops and Deans and Chap|ters,
though yet nothing of their Terra firma) so neither durst those Pres|byterian
Divines who followed them for the Loaves, and who once in a sullen
humour resolved not to have half a Loaf rather then no Bread, reject the
Impropriate Tithes given them, because they saw a new Race of Divines cal|led
Independent ready to take from those Powers what they would give, and
who were prepared by their Religion to support the State-government, and
some of whom had already acquired Church-Livings, and others of whom
in the great Controversie among all those Parties (which was not general|rally
so much de fide propagand as de pane lucrando) would with the favour
of the times easily have then worsted the Presbyterian Clergy in the scram|ble
for that thing aforesaid, that though Moreau in his learned Notes on Scho|la
Salerni, saith, no Book was ever writ of, yet I think few have been writ
but for, namely Bread.
But herein on the whole matter the Vsurpers Policy was so successful as
that ordering the great Revenues of the Church as they did, and Appropria|ting
the Bishops and Deans and Chapters Lands to the use of the State, they
by the augmentations arising from the Fond of the Impropriate Tithes to
their Clergy (and especially to those of them they planted in great Towns
and Cities) ty'd them to their Authority (as I may say) by the Teeth, and
kept them from barking against it, or biting them, which else they would
have been likely to have done, being disappointed as to their gratiae expecta|tivae
of the Lands of the Bishops, had they been let loose to have depended
on maintenance by Oblations in such Towns and Cities, and where they
would have probably tryed with a diversified Curse ye Meros, to fly in the
faces of Masters who would not feed them.
I have before said how the Parliament sweetned them into obedience by
the luscious power of oppressing their fellow Subjects: But neither by any
Revenue adequate to those Impropriate Tithes, nor by any such power of
oppressing (that prerogative of Devils, to torment) can it be imagined that
a Popish Successor will ever be able to ensure the obedience of his Clergy
to himself. His Bishops and Dignitaries will be like the Popes Trent Titu|lars
without a Title, I mean one to a Dignity or Benefice, and the burden of
the Clerical Papists maintenance, lying still on the laity, will make Popery
soon visibly grow weary o it self.

I shall here take occasion to observe that Tithes were first called Impro|priate
by the sarcasm of the dislodged Monks, who thought that the Tithes
Appropriated (for that was the Antient Law-term for them) were improperly
placed on Lay-men; but both the present possessors, and all that know that 'tis
necessary for England's being a Kingdom and no Province, that its Riches ac|cruing
by the number of its Inhabitants, and by improvement of its Soil,
should keep its weight in the Balance of Christendom, especially consider|ing
the growth of France, will for ever think it very improper, that so much
of its Land and Wealth and Populousness should be sacrificed to Religious
Idlers, and that according to Bishop Sanderson's account, almost half of the
Land should be turn'd into Franks for Boares, or as I may say, Sties for
such as are Epicuri de grege Porci, or such as were call'd Barnevelts Hoggs,
he having called the Monkish Herd by that name, of whom if any angers one
they all rise against him, and if he pleaseth them all, there is nothing to be got
but Bristles.
That Herd was not a little molested, as Mr. Fox tells us, by a private Gen|tleman
one Mr. Simon Fish in the Year 1527. who writ a little Book called
The supplication of Beggars addrest to the King, and it had the honour to
reach his Eyes, and to be lodged in his Bosom three or four days, and to
bring its Author to be embraced by the King, and to have long discourse
with him, as Mr. Fox affirms, who Prints that Book, wherein the Author
with much laboured curiosity attaques the Revenue of the Monks with
Arithmetick, a Science necessary for the strengthening of Political no less
Military Discipline.
He saith there in the beginning That the multitude of Lepers and other sick
People and Poor, was so encreased that all the Alms of the Realm sufficed not
to keep them from dying for hunger: And that this happened from counterfeit
holy Beggers and Vagabonds being so much encreased. These saith he) are not
the Herds but Wolfes, c. Who have got into their hands more then the third
part of your Realm. The goodliest Lordships and Mannors are theirs. Beside
this he sets forth that They have Tithes, Oblations, Mortuaries, c. And he
therein saith, That there being in England 52000 Parishes, and Ten Housholds
in every Parish, and five hundred and twenty Thousand Housholds in all, and
every of the five Orders of Fryers receiving a peny a quarter, that is Twenty
Pence in all yearly from every one of these Housholds, the Total Sum was
430333 l.6 s.8 d. Sterling. He further sets forth, That the Fryars
being not the four hundredth Person of the Realm, had yet half its pro|fits.
There were in that little Book many things so pungent, and so confirm'd
by Calculation, that the Clergy put no meaner a Person then Sir Thomas More
on the answering it in Print; and it occasion'd the Bishop of London's pub|lishing
an Edict to call in that little Book, and the English New Testament,
and many Books writ against the excesses of the Priests. Well therefore
might Sir Thomas More be favour'd with a License to read Heretical Books,
when he was to be at the fatigue of answering them. Sir Thomas in his An|swer
to it makes a just exception to Mr. Fish's estimate of the number of
Parishes in the Realm: But admitting there were then Ten Thousand Pa|rishes
in England, and about Forty Houses in one Parish with another in the
Country (beside what were in great Towns and Cities) he might modestly
Calculate 520000 Housholds in all.
Nor is it to be much wondered at, That a private Gentleman should err
in the excess of the number of the Parishes, when we are told in Cotton's Col|lections,
That in the 45 of E. 3. The Lords and Commons in Parliament gran|ting
the King a Subsidy of 50000 l. at the rate of 22 s. 4 d. for each Parish,

they estimated the Parishes then near that number; but were afterward in|form'd
by the Lord Chancellour, that by returns made into the Chancery on
Commissions of Enquiry, it was found there were not so many Parishes in the
Realm.
It had been very acceptable to those who in this Age take their Politi|cal
measures of the power and growth of Kingdoms from Numbers, if ei|ther
Mr. Fish or Sir Thomas More who answered his Golden little Book (as
I may call it, for his endeavours therein to fix matters relating to the Oe|conomy
of the Kingdom by Calculation, and for his being a Columbus to
discover rich Mines without going to America, nor yet further then home)
or if any of our Monkish Historians, or even our Polish'd and Ingenious ones,
and particularly My Lord Bacon, and my Lord Herbert had given the World
Rational estimates of the Numbers of the people of England in the times they
writ of, or particularly of the Numbers of the Males then between the Years
of 16 and 60, for if they had done that (as on the publick Musters made
by occasion of Warlike preparations they might perhaps well have perfor|med)
we might now easily by the help we have had from the Observator
on the Bills of Mortality conclude, what the entire Number of the People
then was, and might likewise have better agreed on a stated Rule of the
Period of Nations doubling; a Curiosity in knowledge not unworthy the
Genius of an Inquisitive or Philosophical States-man, and which presents
to his View as in a Glass the Anatocisme of the faetus populi, resembling the
Interest upon Interest of Money; as for Example, when we see that one pound
in Seventy years (the Age of a Man) is, at 10 per cent. encreased to a Thou|sand.
But it is our misfortune, that through the aforesaid omission of our Hi|storians,
we are not so much illuminated about the encrease of the English
Nation, as we are about the gradual multiplication of the People of Rome
so many hundred years ago: And indeed by the help of the Writers of other
European Countries we are taught to know the Numbers of all people but
our own. But in this State of improvement that the World is arrived at,
I do account that all who shall hereafter employ their Pens about that grea|test
exercise of humane Wit and Judgment, call'd History, and shall not found
the weight of their Remarques upon the Numbers of the People they write
of, will no more be termed grave Authors, or indeed ought but grave nothings,
and such who deal irreverently with a World that is weary of trifles, and
from which they are to expect no other Doom then that of the Annales
Volusi.
And though as to the faetus populi as well as to the faetus pecuniae, called
faenus, accidents may happen that may cross the Rule of encrease in both Ca|ses,
as in the latter by Bankrupts, and in the former by Plague or War, c.
(and thus once as to the Romans, Censa sunt Civium Capita 270 Millia, and
in the following enrollment but 137, Ex quo numero apparuit, saith the Hi|storian,
quantum hominum tot praeliorum adversa, fortuna populi Romani abstu|lisset;
as if he would infer that the losses they received from Hanibal had
swept away 133000 Citizens) yet do such exceptions but confirm the Rule,
the which may be made out by continued mean proportionals. But this by
the way.
If my Lord Herbert who mentions pag. 121 of his History, That in the
Year 1522 Warrants were issued out, Commanding the Certificates of the Names
of all above sixteen Years old, had set down the total number of the persons
certified, he had much more obliged the World then by many things in his
History.

I do not remember that any of our Historians of those times do relate
the Numbers of the Religious Persons that all the suppressed Monasteries
contain'd.
We are told by Godwin in his Annals, That the number of the Abbies that
were in England is not easily cast up, and the Names of the chiefest, and whose
Abbots had voices among the Peers in Parliament, he thereupon enume|rates.
But Weaver in his Funeral Monuments p. 104, mentioning That all the Re|ligious
Houses under the Yearly value of 200 l. being given to the King, and
that they were all worth per annum 20941 l. saith, That the Religious Per|sons
put out of the same were above Ten Thousand.
My Lord Herbert p. 441, speaking of that sort of Monasteries, being dis|solved
in the 27th year of the King's Reign, makes Thirty, or Thirty two
Thousand pound yearly thereby fall into the King's hand: And p. 507, makes
the total yearly value of all the Religious Houses suppressed to be 161100 l. It
may therefore be thence infer'd, that if Thirty Thousand pound yearly main|tain'd
10000 Religious Persons, that there were maintain'd by the 161100 l.
above 50000 Religious Persons or Regulars: And according to the aforesaid
rate of the yearly value of the Land, viz. 161100 l. the allowance to each
came to somewhat above 3 l. per annum, the which shews that those Lands
were not sold to half the value, because less then double that Sum cannot be
imagined to have maintain'd such a person then.
I do account that supposing the Parishes to have been then in England and
Wales, as Cambden in his Britannia says, 9284, that the Secular Clergy added
to the Number of the Regular only the last said Number: For then the Ca|non
Law (which requires, that Orders shall not be given to Men without
Titles) being strictly executed, there were perhaps not more Parish Priests in
England: And the adding to those Numbers the Dignitaries, viz. Two Arch|bishops,
and 24 Bishops, and 26 Deans, and 60 Arch-Deacons, and 544 Pre|bendarys,
and several Rural Deans, doth enlarge the Sum to another Thousand
of Persons who lived by the Altar. Moreover there being then estimated
to live in Oxford and Cambridge about Sixty Thousand Students, who in ex|pectation
of Church-preferment, as either Regulars or Seculars, abstain'd from
Marriage, I account that the Number of Persons then ty'd by Caelibate from
encreasing and multiplying the people to be above 120000, as at present above
double that Number are in France.
What accrued to the Secular Clergy then, or since by Tithes ought not
to have been looked on by any one with an evil Eye, as I suppose by Mr.
Fish it was not. For as to the nature of the payment of Tithes, according
to the judgment of Sir W. P. in his Book of Taxes and Contributions, p. 58,
It may be said to be no Tax or Levy in England, whatever it might have been
in the first age of its Institution.
And this notion of his may be extended even to that which is called a
Tenth, but is revera a Fifth (I mean the Tith of arables in regard of the
charge of Culture and Seed, which is ordinarily at least as much as the Rent
of the Land) because it is a charge equally incumbent on all proprietors of
such Land, and for that the true notion of Wealth and Riches depends on
comparison, and 'tis only the inequality in the proportion of the Tax that
is the sting thereof.
But that which Mr. Fish chiefly level'd his Calculations at, was the ex|cessive
share in the Wealth of the Kingdom the Monks and Fryars had, who
did so little for its preservation, and the encrease of its Numbers. What an
infinite number of people, saith he, might have been encreased to have peopled
the Realm, if this sort of Folk had been married like other Men! Instead of

using his Rhetorical Expression of infinite, I shall affirm that these 120000
adult, able persons living in Celibate might according to the notion of the
Observator of the Bills of Mortality, That every marriage, one with another,
produceth four Children, viz. Two apiece for each Sex, have more then dou|bled
their number in the same age: by which any one may well conclude,
that as the number of the people of England is now vastly encreased by the
dissolution of Abbies, so it would likewise be so diminished by their re-esta|blishment.
To effect therefore to lessen thus the number of the people
of England, when the French King with great wisdom has by the Revival of
the Roman Immunity of the Ius trium librorum, and the application of others,
laid so a great Foundation for the growing populousness of France, would too
much expose us to his power and derision.
The Divine Wisdom's allotting to the Levitical Tribe the affluent quota it
enjoy'd, is very justly took notice of by those who discourse of the Clerical
Revenue.
The Author of the Present State of England, saith, That our Ancestors accor|ding
to the pattern of God's ancient people the Iews, judged it expedient to allot
large Revenues to the English Clergy, and that the English Clergy were the best
provided for of any Clergy in the whole World, except only the Nation of the
Iews, among whom the Tribe of Levi, being not the Fourth part of the twelve
Tribes (as appears in the Book of Numbers) yet had, as Mr. Selden confesseth,
and that by God's own appointment, three times the Annual Revenue of the grea|test
of the twelve Tribes.
Doctor Covel in his Modest and Reasonable examination of some things in use
in the Church of England, Printed Anno 1604, saith in Chapter the Eleventh,
Thatthe Levites were not the Thirteenth part of the Jews, and yet had the
Tenth: Wherein that Doctor agreed with the sense of the Fathers of the Coun|cil
of Trent, who (as 'tis mention'd in the latter end of the History of that
Council) said, That in the Mosaical Law God gave the Tenth to the Levites,
who were the Thirteenth part of the people, prohibiting that any more should be
given them: But the Clergy now which is not the Fiftieth part, hath gotten al|ready
not a Tenth only, but a Fourth part.
But by exacter Calculations, 'tis apparent that the Levites though a small
Tribe (if a Tribe, there being twelve beside) scarce the sixtieth part of the
House of Iacob, had perhaps a Sixth of the whole profits of the Land: They
had the Tenth or Tith of the Land, together with its Culture; they had in
Iudaea, a small Country, 48 Cities, with their Suburbs, 2000 Cubits from
the Wall on every side, and their first-fruits, and a great part of the mani|fold
Sacrifices, and free-will-offerings of the Male Children of Israel, which
were to appear thrice yearly before the Lord with some Offering, and what|soever
House, Field, Person, Beast, c. was by a singular Vow given to God,
which was to be valued by the Priest himself, and all these duties were
brought in to the Priest, without charge or trouble: and those Cities and
Lands descended from them to their posterity, from generation to generation,
as also did their Tithes and Offerings.
I shall here observe, that that which hath probably induced so many to
err in making the number of the Levites so great as aforesaid, was their not
considering what yet is really true in Nature, namely, That the number of
people of any Nation from a month old and upwards (for so the Levites
were counted Numb. 3. 39.) is more then double their number from Twen|ty
years old and upward, and so the rest of the Tribes were numbred Exod.
33. 26. Numb. 26. 62. And therefore I infer that the Levites were but about
a sixtieth of the number of the other Tribes.

But during the Theocracy that the Iews sometimes lived under, or while
God was their King, it being worthy of the Divine Empire to design and
promote the wealth of its Subjects, and consequently that they should encrease
and multiply (for that alone is real wealth) there was no Celibate among the
Levites, or any degree of Ecclesiasticks to hinder the same.
Having thus in the way of Calculation glanced on the Ecclesiastical Polity
of God's peculiar People or Subjects, I suppose the rectitude of that Rule
will shew the obliquity or warping of the practice of the Papal Clergy: For
if we do admit (as I believe we well may) that there are seven Millions of
people in England, of which 120000 is a sixtieth part, this old Church
Polity of the Popes Clergy doth Toto Caelo differ from that of the Israelites,
in that they spend double the proportion of the wealth of the Kingdom, and
yet live in Celibate or without multiplying: And as Mr, Fish in effect said
in that his Book, do hinder procreation by promiscuous coupling with other
Mens Wives.
But 'tis a known great truth, that the great business of the Monks, and
the Ratio studiorum of the Papal Clergy was not to make the Kingdom po|pulous,
but to depopulate. We have for this the testimony of Walter Mappe
Arch-deacon of Oxford, who was bred up with Henry the Second, that the
Abbots and Monks in that time were very Criminous in the point of depo|pulation,
whence that Proverb arose Monachi desertum aut inveniunt aut fa|ciunt,
wherever they seated themselves, they either found the place a Desart,
or made it one.
'Tis said of them, That they laid more places waste then ever William the
Conqueror or his Son Ruus did, when they demolished and destroyed many Pa|rishes
to enlarge the bounds of the new Forrest.
In that Fleet of depopulators there was one first-rate one, namely The Ab|bot
of Osney, who was for his Talent of depopulating so remarkable, that
'twas observed that he made all paupers that dwelt within the purlieus of his
Possessions: And of this Henry the Second took such notice, that one day
when he had not poor people enough for his Alms on some great Festival
he said in a fit of anger, That rather then his bounty should be unemployed he
would make as many beggars as the Abbot of Osney had done.
One would think that the Monks should have been well willers to the en|crease
of the populousness of the Kingdom, for that thereby the values of
their Lands would have been encreased, a thing no doubt that appeared visible
to the Reasons of the more Sagacious among them: But there was another
thing they found palpable, that is, they found themselves well at ease, even
to envy in their vast share of the wealth of the Nation, whereby they Lor|ded
it over both God's inheritance, and the Laity, and therefore they did not
fancy the sight of the Sea of the people increase, by the coming in of the
Tide of new generations, that would have produced much more persons to
maligne, and perhaps contest with them: they naturally therefore wished the
sweet absence of such company from the World, just as in Ireland, and other
thin peopled Countries, the Natives living at their ease have sharp regrets
against the accession of strangers, though they know it would raise the va|lue
of their Lands, and as in America the Natives wish no improvement to
their Country from the Spaniards.
The Monks had got the Monopoly of Religion, and near half the Land
by it, and not having any certain Issue to endear posterity to them, and
consequently to oblige them to promote the wealth of the Kingdom in ge|neral,
and to consult thereby the good of surviving parts of themselves (for
that figure Children make as to Parents) they and the Abbots and Popish
Bishops cared for no more then being warm in the Pyes Nest while they li|ved,

and 'twas as natural to them to repel the thoughts of Colonies of peo|ple
advancing the wealth of the Kingdom by new generations, as 'tis na|tural
to present Trading persons to prevent the publick good of an Act of
Naturalization.
And as this advancement of depopulation was therefore the interest of the
present Monks and Priests, so was it of the present Popes, who knew they
were sure of receiving Aids and Contributions from them, as long as num|bers
of other fresh comers did not drive them off the Stage.
One would rather wonder that our Popish Monarchs saw it not sooner
their Interest, to crush the Politics of these holy Depopulators and Pastors,
that turned the Kingdom into Sheep-walks, and who minding chiefly the
encrease of Cattle by pasture, hindred that encrease of Men that the ad|vancement
of Tillage would have produced, and the furnishing the Crown
with more Subsidy Men, and Soldiers. But this supineness of our Kings
was not only caused by Superstition, and a vitiated fancy in Religion, an
Idol to which Philip the Second sacrificed his Son (and therefore might be well
supposed prevalent with others to wish the generation of their Children or
Subjects restrained) but our Kings were not then stimulated by necessity
to promote the populousness of their Realm, for that their riches and strength
depending on comparison, the same Religious Orders did by Celibate and De|population
equally obstruct the Wealth and Power of the neighbouring
Kingdoms as well as this, and by that means they were not our over|match.
But the course of encreasing Generations having operated so far as to awa|ken
the World, and Men for not having so much Elbow-room as they had,
jostling one another by the violence of War, the politics of Statutes against
Depopulation were forced and reinforced on this Realm: And like as Men,
so too will such Statutes beget one another (as I may say) to the end of the
Chapter. Nor is the power of the Kingdom ever likely again to be really
emasculated by such as pretended To make themselves Eunuchs for the Kingdom
of Heaven's sake, and honoured not the Founder of Christianity, of whom
since he for the good of Mankind made his first Disciples fishers of Men, it
may seem unworthy that he should intend the hurt of States and Kingdoms,
by making the following Doctors of his Church Pastors of Sheep.
Sir Thomas Moor in the first Book of his Vtopia doth with a sharpness wor|thy
his excellent wit tell us, That certain Abbots (holy Men God wot) not
profiting, but much damnifying the Common Wealth, leave no ground for Tillage,
they enclose all in pastures; they throw down Houses, they pull down Towns, and
leave nothing standing, but only the Church, to make of it a Sheep-house. And
afterward saith, That one Shepherd is enough to eat up that ground with Cattle,
to the occupying whereof about husbandry many hands were requisite. And he
in that Book calls the Fryers errones maximos, and desires they might be
treated like Vagabonds and sturdy Beggars. And in the Second Book con|trives
a Model of the Priesthood so as not to make it such a Nusance to the
Civil Government, as the Papal one was, accordingly as has been before
discoursed. For one of his fundamentals there is, That the Priests should be
very few, and that they should be chosen by the people like other Magistrates,
and with secret voices; and enjoyns to his Priests marriage, and makes them
to be promoted to no power but only to honour.
Sir Thomas More it seems was far then from Writing at the Pope's Feet,
(the Character that was afterward given to Bellarmine's style) and there
was as little occasion for a peace-maker's interposal between him and Fish, as
is between two wrangling Lawyers at a Bar.

But the matter is well mended with our English World since the time of
the Supplication of Beggars, as appears by the multitudes of the healthy and
robust Plebs of our Nation, that Till the Earth and Plough the Sea; and
who by the proportion of the Mony Current coming to their hands, ha|ving
fortify'd their Vital Spirits with good diet, there is finis litium, and an
end of such Lamentations, as the beginning of that Supplication to the King
in part before referred mentions, viz. Most lamentably complaineth of their wo|ful
misery to your Highness, your poor daily Beads-men the wretched hideous
Monsters, on whom scarcely for horrour any eye dare look, the foul unhappy sort
of Lepers and other sore people, needy, impotent, blind, lame, and sick, c.
How that their Number is daily so sore encreased, that all the Alms of all the
well disposed people of this your Realm is not half enough to sustain them.
There is no doubt but their indigence was extream, when they were to
glean not only after the Reaping of the Monks, but after the Ecclesiastick
Beggars, the Fratres Mendicantes, (or as they were then called Manducantes)
had been satiated in diebus illis, and when Holy Church almost engrossed
not only the wealth but the begging in the Kingdom.
And he who now looks on our English infantry when they turn their
Plough-shares into Swords, will see nothing of the horrour of starvelings in
their faces: and the Writ de leproso amovendo is in effect obsolete in nature,
as that too de haeretico comburendo is abrogated: And within the Term of
about twenty years that the Observator of the Bills of Mortality refers his
Calculations to, he mentions but six of 229150 dying of the Leprosie. What
the Bills of Mortality in France may contain about deaths by the Leprosie,
happening there in late years, I know not, but do suppose that the general
Scure appearing in the skins of the Pesantry there, condemned to Sell their
Birth-right of nature for no Pottage, and to eat little of the Corn they Sow,
and to drink as little of the Vines they Plant, and to taste little of Flesh,
save what they have in Alms from the Baskets of the Abbies, and who are
Dieted only for Vassalage, may be an indication of the Leprosie, having still
its former effects among them: But our English Husband-men are both bet|ter
fed and taught, and the poorest people here have so much of brown Bread,
and the Gospel, that by the Calculations on our Bills of Mortality it ap|pears,
that for so many years past but One of Four Thousand is starved.
'Tis therefore I think by instinct of Nature, That our Yeomanry in the
Country, though not addicted to mind niceness of Controversie in Religion,
nor to be dealers in the Protestant Faith by Retaile, are great Whole-sale
Traders in it, and will as soon suffer their Ploughs to be took out of their
Hands, as their Bibles from under their Arms: And they have been gene|rally
observed since the Plot, and some years before, to manifest in common
discourse their robust abhorrences of Popery, as supposing that under that
Religion they could neither save their Souls, nor their Bacon.
Doleman alias Parsons in the Second part of his Book of the Succession, speak|ing
of the Numbers of the Papists here, makes it very considerable, In that
the most part of the Country people that live out of Cities and great Towns
(in which the greatest part of the English forces are wont to consist) are much
affected ordinarily to their Religion (meaning the Popish Religion) by reason
the Preachers of the contrary Religion are not so frequent with them as in
Towns, c.
But were he now alive he would find the Scene of things changed in our
Country Churches since Queen Elizabeth's time, in whose Reign a Book
was printed Anno 1585, called A lamentable complaint of the Commonalty by
way of Supplication to the High Court of Parliament for a learned Ministry.
He would find that even in the poorest of our Country Parishes (where yet

by the encrease of people since her time, the values of the Livings are pro|portionably
encreased) there are Ministers more learned then were there in his
time, and that the Reading the Prayers and Homilies of our Church hath fur|nished
our Country-Folks with so much understanding, as will render them
for ever unwilling to sow the matter of which to make the God they must
either devour, or be devour'd by. Had Mr. Coleman vouchsafed to have
spoke with some of this sort of men, he would not have thought the whole
Kingdom ready like moyst Wax to have receiv'd the impressions of Popery,
but would have observ'd in them, That with the stubborn and proverbial
Pride of a Russet Coat, they disdain to draw in the Yoke either of Papacy or
Presbytery, and that they talk of Popery as a Religion that would sink down
both their Souls and Bodies to the state of Brutes, and not only make agri|culture
vail to pasture, but bring them to eat Grass and Hay more pecudum,
as a great Cardinal bragg'd that they had almost prepared the Laiety to do, till
Luther shew'd them better things: and if any one who has not heard the stur|dy
Anathema's that our Rustics in their Common discourses bestow on Pope|ry,
and who has not observ'd that in Elections for Knights of the Shire their
Suffrages are given to the most fiery Zealots against it, shall not have the
same sense with me of the general intense hatred of the Countrey People
egainst Popery, let him Cast his Eye on the Returns made in the Bishops Sur|vey
of the Number of Papists above the age of 16, for those two Diocesses in
which the glory of our English Yeomanry so much abounds, namely of our
Yeomen of Kent, and he shall find that the Number of Papists both male and
female was in Canterbury Diocess but 142, and in that of Rochester 64; and
one would think that the Neighbourhood of France might have transplanted
more of the Popish Persuasion into those Diocesses.
The Traditions our Country People have had from their Ancestors concern|ing
their state in the days of Popery, have sufficiently antidoted them against
the poyson of Traditions from Popish Priests and such who would have them
Traditors of their English Bibles. They have a joyful Gusto of the Petition
of Right (as it were) fresh in their Mouths, and fear the being thrown back
to the supplication of Beggars. They cannot think of the Times of Monkery
here, without thinking of how many of the Plough-men in England were then
Villains, and that too Villains to Abbies, for that part of their Land that
was arable: they were Villains regardant to their Mannors, and such as the
Romans call'd adscriptitii glebae. And 'tis observed by Sir T. Smith in his
3^d^. Book de Repub. Anglorum, c. 10. That the Monks and Fryars when they were
Conversant with the Layety as Confessors in extremis, enjoyn'd them in the Court
of Conscience for the honour of Christianity to manumit all their Villains: but
(saith he) the said holy Fathers with the Abbots and Priors did not so by
theirs. And he saith, Quorum exemplis episcopi insistentes ab ista crudelitate
nisi pretio conducti, aut Calumniis impetiti sero deterreri potuerunt. Dein aequa|tis
solo Monasteriis  in manus laicorum recidentibus, libertatem omnes adepti
sunt. i. e. But at last the Monasteries being levell'd with the ground, they all
gain'd their freedom.
Thus did the Abbots and Monks formerly affect the Monopoly of ordering
Villainage: and the multiplying of the people born of their Villains by suc|ceeding
Generations, did but multiply Slaves to the Abbies; and at the same
time they sow'd Corn for the Abbys, they sow'd their Children too to Ville|nage:
The which is apparent by an Abbot and Convent's formula of manumis|sion
in Edward the Third's time, mention'd in Blount, viz. OmnibusFrater
Mathaeus Abbas de Halesoweign  Conventus ejusdem loci salutem. Noveritis
Nos unanimi voluntate  Consensu fecisse Iohannem del Grene de Rugaker liberum
cum tota sequel su procreat  procreand.

But the Children that now come to see the light in England, are not dam|nati
antequam Nati, Condemned to Servitude before they are born, and our
Yeomen that are above wearing the Badges of our Nobles, will scorn the Vas|salage
to Friers: and when the Genius of the English Nation is so full of Can|dor
(and what few Nations can pretend to) that they never make Slaves of
their Prisoners of War in any part of Europe, none I believe will ever see their
incomparable Infantry by whom their Battels are won, to become Slaves in
Peace, and the very Slaves too of Slaves, I mean of the Monastic Slaves to
sloth.
That 40 s. a Year that made them in the state of legales homines heretofore,
is now become in value 6 l. per annum: and as by the encrease of their Wealth
they are the more enabled to go to Law, so the Policy of William the Conque|rour
to have mens Lands lie scatter'd as they are in Common Fields, to the in|tent
that the multiplicity of Law Sutes occasion'd thereby might divert their
uniting against him, (the which hath been Commonly call'd the Conquerour's
Curse) hath however enured them to a pugnacious spirit of litigation in the
Law, and the effect of which tough mettle of theirs, Popery is likely to find if
ever it shall be a Trespasser on them: and in fine, Popery need never balder
us with any other miracles, if it can effect this one, namely, to reconcile
our Husbandmen to love it, and to applaud the Ius Divinum of the Monks
that coming in Sheeps clothing, would by a Pasce Oves make Pasture confound
Tillage.
The truth is, they are as unlikely ever to effect this, as are any who love
the Noble Sport of Hunting, to reduce England to its Primitive state, and
more remote then Pasture, namely, Forrest, (for that and Marsh is the Natu|ral
state of all uncultivated and desolate Lands) tho they should too try to
hunt as with a full cry out of the Scripture into that state, and with the 
of Isaia, cry, Resonate Montes laudationem, sylva  omne lignum ejus;
and further tell us of the antiquity of the Divine Right to Forrests appear|ing
out of those words of the Royal Prophet, For all the Beasts of the Forrest
are mine, c. and should insinuate that 'twas fit to unpeople the Earth of men
to make groves for Gods to inhabit.
We are told in the Preface to Manwood, That in the Reigns of Richard
the First, King Iohn, and Henry the Second, the Crown had afforrested so
much of the Lands of the Subjects, as that the greatest part of this Realm was
then become Forrest; but no man is so sensless as to pretend to fear the Return
of any such state in England.
And according to the Principles of Sense and reason it may be affirm'd, That
all Monkish hopes of our Ploughmen happening again to be over-run by
Shepherds, are very extravagant, and Popery will grosly err, if it shall think
that Poverty will ever compel this sort of men to the turpitude of taking up
illegal Arms for it, or that it can eradicate their innate hatred against it.
The Subsistence that the Plough afforded our Husbandmen in their
Trade, made few of them in Comparison of those of other Trades, be|come
Souldiers in our late Civil Warrs: Nor were they then observ'd
to favour those hyhocritical Religion-Traders the Land was then pester'd
with. Nor indeed can they who really Till and Improve the Earth, na|turally
affect those who pretend to Cultivate Heaven; and by necessity
of Nature it must still come to pass, that they who acquire their own bread
by rearing it for others with hard labour, will have an aversion against
those who can subsist luxuriously, by cheating others of it with easie Tricks,
and against any attempts for a Resetled Monkery, which would, after the mode
of the Pyed Piper, demand an unconscionable rate for trying to rid us of a
few haeretical Mice, and which too tho our Land should pay, would yet de|populate
it of its Children.

And here I cannot forbear to Observe, That there happen'd one thing so
momentous, that it can never be forgot while the English Nation has a Be|ing,
and which did among our people in the Country Convey a fresh sense
of the Pestilential nature of Popery, and of the encreasing Danger of its in|fection,
and that is, that the Body of our Clergy of the Church of England,
did generally from the Press and Pulpit for some Years together send so
many strong Antidotes against Popery round the Kingdom. Every Pulpit
almost from one end of the Land to the other did resound, as I may say, with
a Seasonable discourse against Popery. It may be with Justice apply'd to those
Discourses of our Divines, That they alarmed more than our English World,
or perhaps the Roman, and that the World elsewhere did ring with their
; I here allude to those words in the Epistle to the Romans, :
Their sound went into all the Earth, and their words to the ends of the World.
There is no doubt but their Sound was heard to Rome by the help of the Ie|suits
intelligence, and that our Divines knew when they so Preach'd and Writ,
they had pass'd the Rubicon, and that 'twas in vain like Cranmer to try to be
reconciled to irreconcileable Rome, and that 'twould be as much in vain in
any Course of future time to use politic whispers in Commendation of Popery
after their former loudness against it, as for one who told a Husband that he
saw such an one strugling to ravish his Wife, to say afterward that he was a
very Civil Gentleman.
Our Fanaticks therefore do by nothing more deserve that Name, then by
nick-naming the Body of the Clergy of the Church of England as fautors of
Popery, since 'twas but of yesterday that almost all our First and Second Rate
Divines did like Capital Ships (as I may say) one after another attaque the
Fleet of the Romanists, and discharge their Thunder upon them: but as my
Lord Bacon hath observ'd, That in great Sounds the Continuance is more
than momentany, and that the noyse of Great Ordnance, of which the Sound
is carry'd many miles on the Land, and much further on the Sea, will there
come to the Ear not in the instant of the shooting off, but an hour or more
later, the which must needs be the Continuance of the first Sound; Thus too,
I hope, that the aforesaid late  of our Capital Divines against Po|pery
which has been heard far and near among our Countery Inhabitants,
(and will I believe Continue audible among them during the hour of life) will
in part of that hour, sooner or later, be heard with regard by our weaker Bre|thren.
But what a Daemon then in understanding, or God of Eloquence had he need to
think himself, and to be thought too such by others, who Imagines to talk En|gland
both out of its Manna of Religion, and what is better then its Flesh-Pots
too, and to persuade us by bringing in Monkery again, to have our Land ore-run
with Flocks of Sheep, and to want hands to Work their Fleeces, or (as I may say)
to fancy to have Manufacture without hands; and for want thereof, to make our
Sheep almost useless but only to eat, and in that way too to be chiefly appro|priated
to the Stomachs of Lubbers; and, who would allow our Land Flocks
of Sheep, but not Dogs to guard them; I mean a sufficient growing Populacy
in the Land to defend both it, and the very Flocks in it, and I may add too,
who would almost make the Wooll of our Sheep useless but only to send into
Forrain Parts; and who would abdicate from the Land that benefit of the
continual passing of our Wooll here through so many hands busy'd in Trade,
and thence fill'd with Wealth in the way of Interest upon Interest intended by
Nature for the maintenance and subsistance of our People, so multiplying as
aforesaid, and preparing Tables for all new Guests here, let them come into the
World never so fast; and would have us Consent to the diminution of the

Number of our People, when for want of our being fully stock'd with them,
so great a part of our Land lyes fallow every Year, as doth not in Countreys
sufficiently Populous, and where the Lands value will quit the cost of the
Manuring.
Alas; when through the Divine Blessing England shall arrive at the state
of being fully Peopled, and being got beyond Pasture, that first improve|ment
of a thin Peopled Country, shall likewise have Compleated that second
of Tillage, that our being better Peopled will occasion, there will lie a third in
our View to employ the Labours of our Consummate Populacy, namely that
of Gardening, and to oblige us that the Earth shall produce nothing but what
is exactly useful: and instead of going back from Tillage to Pasture, we must
naturally go forward from Tillage to Gardening, whereby one Acre may be
made to maintain Twenty persons, whereas now 'tis observ'd that 20 Acres
generally throughout England maintain but a fourth of that number, viz.
5. persons.
And when we are thus furnished with as many People as by Tillage or
Gardening can well live on the Land, 'tis then, and not before, that our en|creasing
Populousness will push on greater numbers of our Inhabitants to live
on the Sea, which none will choose to do, that can live on the Shoare: and
'tis only such a state of populacy that can naturally make us Masters of the
Fishing-Trade; to compass which, all our Projects before, whether by Acts of
Parliament, or Companies and Stock, will be but Chymerical.
Moreover, 'tis only such a state of Populacy that will exonerate us of those
burdens of the Earth, and scandals to Heaven, I mean all Religion-Traders,
whether Popish or Fanatical, those vilest of Nominales who cheat in nomine
Domini, and such likewise who disquiet States by assuming the Trade of
World-menders, and everlasting Propounders, that are like busie Insects flying
in the Eys of Mankind, (and whom Sir E. Coke in the 85. Ch. of his Institutes,
which is entituled against Monopolists, Propounders and Projectors, deservedly
brands) and Atheists that would reform a Church, Bankrupts in their parti|cular
Trades that would advance Trade in general, Defiers of Justice who
would amend the Law, and wasting that time as Censors of the Manners of
Kings for not paying their Debts, which they should employ in acquiring
Assets to pay their own: In fine, Undertakers to Cure Church and State as
Confident as the Quack who said in his Bills, He Cureth all Diseases both cure|able,
and incureable. All these sorts of men whose Trade is talking, and whose
talk is cheat, will only come to be Bankrupt by being heaved out of all places
by the Generations of Useful Traders multiplying there. Nature that has
been long laying its Siege to such Idlers in places of resort, will then at last
carry on its works so far as to leave them no Earth to play their Engines up|on,
and such unprofitable people will be as naturally extruded out of our
Towns, as are Women and Children out of Places besieged: nor can all the
humming of their Propositions procure them more continuance in such places
of business, then the noyse of Drones entitle them to a residence in the Hive;
and it will as little quit Cost to have them planted in our Cities, as for a Gar|diner
that pays a high Rent to have beds for weeds.
Of the Improvement of great quantities of Land by Gardening, the Ilands
of Iersey and Guernsey, are examples: and we have a Pleasant and Profitable
Prospect of such Improvement near our Metropolis and other Great Cities;
and I doubt not but England may flourish so as to become the Garden of the
World: and do as little doubt of any Course of time bringing the Pope again
to say as Matthew Paris tells us he did, Ver hortus Noster deliciarum est An|glia,
as I do of that honest Monk's sleeping till the Resurrection, or Mr. Cole|man's
having any more Dreams of a Paradise in the Gardens of Wooburn.



'Tis hard for a Visionaire not to fancy any thing possible: but he who
shall pronounce that England can from its present improvement and popu|lousness
be driven back ad primordia rerum, and that the many cultivated
understandings in it, and who have reduced Knowledge ad firmam by cal|culation,
can be reduced to the Calculation only of Beads and be imposed
on like the Indians to part with their Gold for Beads, and that half the
Land of England now inhabited by three Millions of People (as all esti|mates
make to be the least that half of it contains) will be delivered up to
50000 Regulars and to persons that the Laws in being allow not so much as
a Foot of Earth for Graves, and that it is not of equal detriment to a Coun|try
to have half the Land made unprofitable and become Bog or the like, as
to be long in perpetuity to unprofitable people, and that such as make pro|perty
their God (which they who over value the things of this
Life do, and are the Majority of any Country) will idlely sacrifice it to
those real Impropriators who make but a Property (as I may say) of God,
I mean those hypocritical Idlers who only by a Religion-Craft without any
service useful to Mankind claim a great Quota of the Profits of others la|bours,
and that when we are going on so fast toward the exactest culture by
Gardening, which excludes all Weeds, the old inimicus homo shall find six
Millions asleep to give him an opportunity to sow Tares and to ask half the
Land for his pains, I say, he who shall pronounce as aforesaid, is one that
looks but at few things, and so de facili shoots his Bolt, and is one that we
may think to be a fool without being in danger of Hell Fire: and Holy
Churches great work of the Conversion of three Kingdoms, to the end that it
may Convert half the Land again to its use, is likely to prove as fruitless as
the Christian endeavours to recover the Holy Land.
There is such a strong Rampart of living Earth against the assaults of Pope|ry
in this kind I mean the Number of our Protestants and particularly of those
employ'd in Tilling the Land, that Popery cannot dissolve: and let it pipe
never so plausibly, we shall be like the deaf Adder stopping our Ears by
laying them against the Earth we are possest of.
My Lord, They who have observed the Intervals of your pleasure, when
you have had some breathing times for retirement, from the fatigue of
Affairs of State, know that the contriving the improvement of your Ground
by Tillage and Planting and Gardening, hath been at once your care and
your delight. And I believe Cicero's Cato Major doth not describe the plea|sure
of old Age in the improvement of the Earth, with greater hight then
your Lordship is able to do: and your example in this thing may Crown
both that of Tully and the Aged Hero's by him there commemorated for
delighting in Husbandry: and indeed it may be supposed but natural for
old Age being so near the Earth its Center to move with a quicker sort of
delight toward it, and especially among Christians to whom the dull Earth
Aided by the acuteness of St. Paul (I referr to his similitude of the Corn)
is so kind and greateful for their culture of it, as to Court them with an
Embleme of their Resurrection, and to teach them a surer way, then Gali|laeus
had found out to Transplant the Earth into Heaven. But now, me|thinks
to one that has so curious and perfect a Sence of this solid and manly
pleasure that the Culture of the Earth affords, as your Lordship, the very
Idea of England's Degeneracy from its thriving State of Agriculture to
poor solitary pasture (how unpracticable soever the thing is) must
necessarily carry some horrour with it to be imagined, and the very tel|ling
it to you that some vain Popish Projectors would rob us not only of
the Culture of Learning, but even of that of the very Earth, must give
your thoughts a Nausea instead of such a Noble Extacy as fill'd the whole

Soul of Erasmus who in his old Age in a Letter to Budaeus speaking of Sir
Thomas More's and other mens Works that did then begin to beautifie the
World with Learning, cryes out, Deum immortalem, quod seculum video
brevi futurum! Vtinam contingat rejuvenescere!
And as I am sure you would not desire to Renew your Youth like the
Eagle, only to live in an Age of buzzards, so you know too much of the
course of nature to wish your Life a day shorter for fear of the longevity of
Popery, if ever it should call it self here the State-Religion: for it can na|turally
be but a short dull Parenthesis of time in an Age of Sense, and the
Eye of Reason can see through the duration of it as well as through its
absurdities, and it can naturally be but like an angry Cloud, that with the
Eye of Sense we shall see both dropping and rowling away over our heads,
and shall behold the Sun playing with its Beams around the Heavens, near
it at the same time: and nothing can be easier to you then to dye in the
Faith, that Popery cannot live long in England, and to know that you are
not to be compared to an Infidel, though you should have provided for
your surviving Family nothing but Abby Lands, the which I believe may
by a bold instrument of Eternity drawn by a small Scriveners Boy, be effe|ctually
Conveyed to any Lay-man and his Heirs for ever.
I know that the present State of that part of the Land of England that
was aliend from the Church, is such that it bears not the price of years pur|chase
it did before the Plott, and that it is according to the common ex|pression,
become a drug as to Moneys being taken up on it in comparison of
other Lands: and it is obvious to consider how much herein the Plott
hath prejudiced the Wealth and Trade of the Kingdom, in making so great
a part of the Land in some regard comparatively useless to the Possessors:
but I likewise know that hereby Popery will be no gainer, for that 'tis ap|parent
that the owners of it will be indefatigable in the use of all means
lawful to bring Popery to such a State, as shall make any men ashamed
to say they fear it.
Tho Holy Church that everlasting Minor, that Minor like Sir Thomas
Mores Child that he said would be always one, will be still labouring the
Resumption of what was alien'd from it (and hence I believe it hath pro|ceeded,
that our Kings th in the eye of the Law always at full Age, have
thought fit to learn from Holy Church the Priviledge too of being reputed
Minors or Infants in Law, for so the Books call them, that upon occasion
they may resume what was alien'd from the Crown) and th the hopes of
such resumption would be a bait to help Popery to Multitudes of Proselytes,
yet the people imagine a vain thing who think such resuming practicable in
England, and especially at this time if the Calculation of the Ebb of the
Coinage of England be as is contain'd in Britannia languens, viz. from the
foremention'd period of May 1657, to November 1675, (near another
nineteen years) 3, 238, 997 l. 16s. , a Calculation that I think cannot be dis|proved
but by the Records in the Pipe Office, where annual account of the
Money Coined in the Mint are preserved, or by Ballances of Trade made up
from that time, whereby the exportations eminently preponderating what is
imported, would evince what considerable quantities of Bullion have been
Coyned, or by our knowing that since that time Sterling Silver has not still
obtain'd the Price of 5s 2d an Ounce, a price that it has not indeed fall'n
short of in England about these twenty years past, and therefore before the
late Act for the Coynage, could never be entertain'd by the Mint to be Coyn'd,
which was by its Law and Course necessarily restrain'd from giving for Ster|ling
Silver above 5 s. the Ounce, and which Rate and no more it did afford
when the Ballance of Trade favouring us caus'd that vast Coynage mention|ed
in the former Ternary of nineteen years.

But in fine, his Majesties Royal Goodness to his People in not only quit|ting
what did accrue to him for Coynage, but being at the expence of the
Coyning the most exquisite sort of Money in the Known world, and such
as in Curiosity does equal Meddals, is an indication of the Ballance of Trade,
not having employed the Mint sufficiently in making for his Subjects the
Medium of Commerce; and for the depression of the Trade not only of
the English but of more then the European World, the Usurper Crom|wel
is to be justly blamed, who not long after the wounds England had felt
by the Munster Peace, did harrass us by his fantastick War with Spain,
which not only impoverish'd England but the Trading World, and forcibly
obstructing the Returns of the Spanish Plate Fleets, did particularly put
both Spain and France under a necessity of making that Peace that gave
the French Crown its leasure to trouble the World.
But let any one judge then how ridiculous it is to suppose, that the
Trade of the Nation must not, as I may say, shut up Shop, if half its wealth
should be again juggled into the hands of a few Ecclesiasticks, and the old
Trade between England and Rome be renew'd of giving the Pope Gold for
Lead.
It must indeed be acknowledged by all who have conversed with History
that the absolute and unbounded Power with which the Eastern Monararchs
Governed their Kingdoms, did not more require an excessive share of the
publick Revenue to feed standing Armies then Priests, who with their Idols
and Superstitions, and Crafts, did awe and delude People into obedience:
but as in orderly Commonwealths there is no need of such an immense
Charge for Artifice to make men obey themselves, so in our Constitution
of the English Government, it being justly to be supposed, that we have
all the desireable, solid and substantial freedom that any Form of Go|vernment
can import, besides the insignificance of the name of it (and in|significant
we may well call it who remember that our late real Oligarchists
took not only the name of God, but the name of a Commonwealth in vain)
and are to the envy of Forraigners, and shame of our former Domestick
Propounders, blessed with the Soveraign Power of a Great and Glorious
King over a free and happy People (as the words of the Royal Martyr
are in one of his Declarations) it may be well said to any one who shall
talk of giving half the profits of the Realm to use Art, and Imposture
to make Members obey their Head so constituted, quorsum perditio
haec?
But in a word, to come closer to the Case of Popery, any one that
would have half the Revenue of the Kingdom given to Impostors for the
making a Monarch only half a King, or King but of half his People, and
for the tricking both him and them into a blind obedience to a Forraign
Head, and for the making a Forraign Power Arbitrary and absolute, is a
very bad Land-Merchant, and knoweth not the use or value of the soyle of
England, and will never find the half of 25 Millions of Acres sold for
Chains and Fetters, and will be put to the trouble of taking out the Writ,
de idiota inquirendo against at least three Millions who have already out|witted
him, and will never think a Forraign Minor and whose concessions are
resumable, fit to be their Guardian, and account it a very preposterous thing
that since our Saviour refused to divide an Inheritance, his pretended Vi|car
should do nothing else.
Moreover Holy Churches resuming all its Lands out of Lay hands,
would appear the more strange in England when we see (as my Lord Pri|mate
Bramhal saith in his vindication of the Church of England, p. 212) that
the very Kings of Spain impose Pensions usually on Ecclesiastical preferments

to the 4th part of the value, and particularly one Pension on the Arch-Bishop|rick
of Sivile in favour of an Infant of Castile of greater value then all the
Pensions there imposed by the Pope; and when we know that the French
King doth for the behoof of so great a number of Lay-men, impose so ma|ny
and great Pensions on the Abbeys without saying to the Abbots more
then Car tel est nostre plaisir.
Sir Edwyn Sands in his Europae Speculum writ in the Year 1599, and in
the time of Harry the 4th of France, speaking of that Kingdom, saith,
That there the Church Prelacies and other Governments of Souls, are made the
Fees and Charges of meer Courtiers and Soldiers: and our excellent Anim|adverter
on Monsieur Sorbier reflecting on that Country, Intimates in effect
how there the chiefest spiritual dignities are entailed upon Families, and
possest by Children.
They who unjustly cry out of the Constitution of the Church of England,
for interrupting the Trade of the Kingdom, would be loud enough in their
Complaints of Omnia comesta  Belo under Popery.
He who knows not that the Revenue of the King now depends in a man|ner
solely upon Trade, and that Trade depends on populousness, and that
the encouragement of people to live under any Government, is that great
thing, call'd Property in their Estates, Religion, and Laws, and that there|fore
any thing that calls it self Religion, that goes to exterminate above a hun|dred
and fifty persons for every one it leaves (for so the Proportion between
Non-Papists and Papists by the Bishops survey made about the Year 1676,
was return'd to be) and to call them Hereticks, and which makes their
Goods and life ipso facto a forfeit of the Law, will not ipso facto exterminate
Trade, is fitter for the Galleys or a Trading Voyage to the Anticyrae, then
for any discourse of Trade and Commerce.
Your Lordship hath in your Travels sufficiently seen it long since exem|plified,
that the Protestant Countries for the quantity of Ground exceed
the Popish in Trade, and numbers of People, and that thus the Protestant
Hanse Towns have eclipsed their Roman Catholick Neighbours; and Am|sterdam,
Antwerp, and the Vnited Provinces, Flanders, and that in Flan|ders
where the Ecclesiasticks are Proprietors of seven parts of ten of the
whole Country, Levies of Men and Money for the defence thereof have
been made, with so much slowness and difficulty, and been so inconsidera|ble
as not to have secured themselves against Invaders.
Nor did the Ecclesiasticks there think it worth their while, to strain
themselves in Contributions to resist an Invader who is of their own Religion
(the which made the French Kings Victories there flie like Lightning) more
then our over-rich English Regulars did to oppose William the Conqueror,
when he came here under the Popes Banner. And thus were they here, and in
Flanders are like Wenns in the Body which draw to themselves much nourish|ment
and are of great trouble and no use, and thus ridiculous is it that so over
great a part of the property of the Land, should be linked to persons, who
are no way linked to the interest of the Country, more then professed Game|sters
and Empyrics and Soldiers of Fortune, and are no more damnified by
Popish Invaders, then Fishes of the Sea are by Earth-Quakes.
But on the other hand in the United-Provinces, how easily and soon are
vast Taxes raised when their All is at Stake,  to what a prodigious encrease
of the numbers of their People have they attain'd since the Reformation?
insomuch that the Author of a Political discourse of the Interest of Holland
Printed in Dutch in the Year 1669, and Licensed by Iohn de Witt and by
Van Beaumont, makes the People in the Province of Holland to be 2 Millions
and 400 thousand, and so likewise doth Pellerus in his Learned Notes on

Klockius de Aerario p. 300. and there cites that Book of the interest of Hol|land,
when as Gerard Malynes in his Lex mercatoria makes the People in
Flanders in the Year 1622 to have consisted of a hundred and forty thousand
Families, and he reckoning each of them one with an other at 5 persons,
makes the Total of the people in Flanders to have then amounted but to
seven hundred thousand Souls.
And yet as that Author of the interest of Holland saith, the Province of
Holland can hardly make 400 thousand profitable Acres or Morgens of
Land, Down and Heath not put in, and that the 8th part of the Inhabi|tants
of Holland cannot be nourished with what is growing there: but
tells us what prodigious Granaries they there have, and that Amsterdam
that in the Year 1571 was about 200 Morgens or Acres of Land, was in the
year 1650 enlarged to 600 Morgens or Acres of Land in Circumference,
and to have in it three hundred thousand Souls.
And the defence of the Zelanders Choice Printed in the Year 1673,
mentions Aitsmas Liere to have reckon'd the publick Incomes of Holland
alone in the Year 1643, to have amounted to 1100 thousand pound Ster|ling;
and the Author of the Interest of Holland saith, that in one Year in
a time of Peace, viz. In the Year 1664 the Inhabitants of Holland did over
and above the Customes and other Domains of the Earls or States of Hol|land
pay towards the publick Charge as follows, viz.
To the States of Holland 11 Millions of Gilders.
To the Admiralty of the Maze, 472 898 Gilders.
To the Admiralty of Amsterdam 2 Millions of Gilders.
To the Admiralty of the Northern Quarter, 200 thousand Guilders.
Which comes to in all about 14 hundred, 87 thousand Pounds Sterling.
How meanly do the Atchievements of Venice, and their Efforts to ag|grandize
their Republick, compared with Hollands shew in story, for the
quantity of years many times doubled since the Dutch threw off the Yoke
of the Papacy! History hath recorded the longevity of the Venetian Govern|ment
as it has of Methusalem of whom we read, not  great thing he
said, or did, or attempted; but a few days of the short life of Alexander,
in the Ballance of same weighs down the 999 years of the other.
The very Religion of Popery makes the Venetians more narrow in their
principles, and even in their Rules of Traffick then are the Inhabitants of
Protestant Countries. The Popish Religion doth hamper its devout Professors
as to Trading with Hereticks, and holding Communication with such as are
ipso jure  ipso facto excommunicated, and giving any Quarentine to men
said to be infected with Heresie, insomuch that we are told in D' Ossat's Let|ters,
Part. 2d. That the Republick of Venice would not suffer the Ambas|sador
of Henry the 4th to them th a Catholick to be admitted to their
Chappels with other Ambassadors, because they did not know his Master
to be reconciled to the See of Rome.
And Bodin de Rep. says, That the number of the Inhabitants of Venice
was taken Anno 1555, and was then in all but one hundred and eighty thou|sand
and four hundred and forty.
Sir William Temple in the 5th Chapter of his Observations on the Uni|ted
Provinces, makes one of the great Causes of the first Revolt in the Low-Countries
to be the oppression of Mens Consciences, or Persecution in their Liber|ties,
Estates, and Lives on the pretence of Religion; and it may be truly said
that by their buying the truth at the Rate of such high Taxes as they now
pay, and not selling it either to France or Spain, they have been no losers; for
many good Artists and wealthy Fugitives have brought their Persons and
Families and Estates to them for shelter, from the Storm of Papal Persecu|tion,

and daily continue so to do; insomuch that the Author of the Zelan|ders
Choice in Sect. 3. Observes that of late years some of the Wise Men of
the Reformed Religion in France, being fearful of its being there utterly sup|planted,
have required their Children by their last Wills and Testaments to
leave France and settle themselves in the Vnited Provinces: and in so doing,
they bestowed rich Legacies on Holland, each head of any new comer be|ing
judged to add at a Medium 3 l. per year to the riches of the State.
The late great late accession of Protestant strangers to Amsterdam, hath
caused many new houses to be there built, and hath raised the Rents of the
old ones a 5th part, whereas they are sunk a 4th in Cheapside in Lon|don.
'Tis there that Men of every Nation under Heaven, Parthians, and Ara|bians,
Iews, Papists, Calvinists, Lutherans, and the Christians of the Sub|divisions
of all Sects do hear Men speak in their own Language, and what
they think most Musical to them, the wonderful works of God.
Nor are the Enemies to Monarchy to ascribe the flourshing State of
Holland, to its former throwing the Power of the State-holder, and Cap|tain
General out of the Ballance of their Government. Their breaking
down the Banks of his Authority, introduced the sudden inundation of the
French Power among them, that they had else been more secured against
then the Assaults of the Ocean, and not have so perfectly forgot the Art and
Nature of Defensive War in their Frontiers: and th it may seem plausible
that an Animal, supposed to have most heads, will have most brains, and
that Republicks are more apprehensive of their true interest then other
Governments, yet to the Reproach of such Politicks it appear'd, that when
the Regnant Faction in Holland were no more headed by a Captain General
or State-holder, and had thrown the poise of his Power out of the Scales,
they grew so vain, as th they had no Capital Ships, yet to become aggres|sors
in a Naval War against England, that had Ships enow of that kind to
affright the World, and of which War the Result was the abolishing their
great Navigation  England, from whence their forced frequenting of our
Harbours, still occasions their exporting more of our Commodities then we
import of theirs. But this by the way.
However so vast yet is their Navigation, and the number of their Mar|riners
that th we need them not for our Carriers, both Spain and France
do: and to which Kingdoms they have and probably will for some Ages to
come, have the honour and profit to be Carriers, how much soever France
is or seems to be fear'd by us: and thus that Book of the Interest of Holland
tells us, viz. That the French have very few Ships and Marriners of their own,
so that almost all their Traffick for Holland (some few English Ships of Trade
excepted) is driven by Dutch Ships, and that when any Goods are trans|ported
from one French Haven to another, they are laden on Board Dutch
Vessels, and that as to Spain, that it hath so few Marriners and Ships that
since the Peace between them and Holland, they have used to hire Dutch
Ships to sail to the Indies.
And therefore when I consider what that ingenious Author hath thus dis|coursed,
and that Sir W. P. in a Manuscript discourse in the Year 1671/2, hath
Calculated the number of the Total of the Seamen, who are Subjects of
France to be 15000, and that a great and fatal diminution of the
number of them since happen'd in the Year 1678, by so many of their
then perishing under D' Estre in the West-Indies, and that as the Author of
Britannia languens saith, The Dutch have at least 10 times as many Seamen
as the English, I shall venture to conclude that more then all the Millions
of Mankind now living will be dissolved to Ashes before (humanly speak|ing)

it will be possible for France to over-ballance either the Dutch or 
at Sea, and whoever they are that pretend to fear the Contrary, I think
they do but pretend to fear it.
But at once to return to the consideration of the gain Holland hath from
fresh Advenae, and to take my leave of it, all old Trades being there fully im|proved,
such new comers are forced to dig up a new Soile of Trade and In|dustry,
as I may call it, for their subsistance; and thus at the Charge of their
Experiments the Country is enriched: and many new Artists there bring
with them their old experimented Arts, and thus 'tis known that an Eng|lish-man
from Yarmouth coming to be an Inhabitant among them, taught
them the rich Arcanum of the Fishing Trade: and since they disused to
pray to dead Saints in the way of Popery, they have found living Saints
praying to them to be admitted to live with them, and have not only had
the honour to entertain Saints, but by being not forgetful to entertain Stran|gers,
they have unawares entertain'd Angels (as the Scripture expression is)
and such who have proved tutelar ones to their Country and Religion.
No marvel therefore if the Learned Divine, the Author of the Defence
of the Zelanders Choice, doth there so pathetically pronounce his opinion,
that if ever the Protestant Religion shall leave Holland, that Country may be
called Ichabod, i. e. the Glory is departed from it.
And here I should be injurious to the Political Energy of the Reformation
in England, if I should not observe how vastly it has contributed to the en|crease
of the value of our Land, and the number of the people and the extent
of our Commerce, and indeed of Commerce it self.
It was not long before the Reformation that the Kings and People of Eng|land,
maintained themselves chiefly by Sheperdry, and the Kings and peo|ple
of France by Tillage, and their great improvement in Manufacture,
bears Date but from Harry the 4ths time. The great Scene of Merchandi|zing
was not open'd in Europe till about 6, or 7 hundred years ago, and till
then none were there worthy the names of Merchants except some few in
the Republicks of Italy, who lived in the Mediterranean parts trading with
the Indian Caravans in the Levant, or driving some inland Trade, and then
and some hundreds of years afterward, the Nations in the worst Soil of Europe
being the greatest breeders, and having superfluity of nothing but people,
had no invention for living but by being Murderers, and by the boysterous
Trade of Fighting their way into better Quarters: and during that dark
and Iron Age that produced Herds of Men void of knowledge, there was
nothing in humane Conversation or discourse valuable; and in our European
World it was scarce worth Men a few steps to gain one anothers acquain|tance:
but on the gradual encrease of knowledge there, Men found a rea|dier
way at once with delight and profit to exchange Notions and Commo|dities
of Traffick, and the Protestant Religion at last drawing up the Cur|tain
that kept all things obscure on that Stage of the World, Men being
better taught the knowledge of the God of Nature and of Nature it
self, were grown worth one anothers knowledge, and were for the
surprizing brightness of their intellectual Talents gazed on by the wondring
World, like in Machines, Gods coming down out of Clouds, and it was wor|thy
of the bounty of Heaven, then to spread on the Earth the Commerce
of Men and the Medium of Commerce too, and to allow them to converse
together with more splendor by the Donative of the American Mines when
the dawn of the knowledge a little before that of the Reformation had ren|dred
them conversable Creatures, and fit for the interviews of one another:
and shortly afterwards by a mighty encrease of Navigation, many did pass to
and fro, and knowledge was more and more encreased.

Thus as I have some where read of a saying of one of the Fathers,
Deus ambit nos donis  form su, the Divine Goodness provided that the
World should Espouse the beauty of the Reformation with a great Dowry,
and that it should appear particularly in England with the great Figure that
Wisdom makes in the Proverbs, Length of days is in her right hand, and in
her left hand riches and honour.
And the truth is conspicuous in our English History that former in|tervals
of some Efforts of Trade, and of some, of withstanding the Papal En|croachments
were alway contemporary, and liv'd and dy'd together, and they
were no sooner risen out of the Grave where the barbarity of former times
depressed them, but they were again found in one anothers Embraces.
That the Stock and Wealth of the Kingdom, is vastly encreased since
Harry the 8ths time, is visible to any one who considers what Stow saith
in his Annals on the Year 1523, the 15th Year of his Reign, That when
in a Parliament held at Black-Fryers, and where Sir Thomas More was
Speaker, 800000 l. was required to be raised of the fifth part of every mans
Goods and Lands, that is 4s, of every Pound to be paid in 4 years: but it
was denyed, and it was proved manifestly that if the fifth part of the substance
of the Realm were but 800000 l, and if Men should pay to the King the fifth
part of their Goods in Money or Plate, that there was not so much Money out
of the Kings, hands in all the Realm: for the fifth part of every Mans Goods is
not in Money or Plate, c. And then consequently if all the Money were brought
to the Kings hands, then Men must barter Cloath for Victuals, c. And there
it was further Argued that the King had by way of Loan 2 s. in the Pound
(which is 400000 l.) and if he had 4 s. more in the Pound, 'twould amount to
1200000 l, which is almost the 3d part of every Mans Goods, which in Coyn
cannot be had within the Realm.
That the Merchandizing Trade of England was before the Reformation,
and sometime after managed chiefly by Forraigners, we Learn out of Hey|lin's
Edward the 6th, p. 108, where he saith that Edward the 6th, Supprest the
Corporation of Merchant Strangers, the Merchants of the Stilyard, concerning
which we are to know that the English in the times foregoing being neither
strong in Shipping, nor much accustomed to the Sea, received all such Commo|dities
as were not of the growth of their own Country from the hands of Stran|gers,
resorting hither from all parts to upbraid our laziness, namely Merchants
known by the name of Easterlings, who brought hither Wheat and Rye and Grain,
c. for their encouragement wherein they were amply priviledged and exempt|ed
from many impositions.
I shall here deduce a proof of the growth of the Revenue of the Nation,
from the growth of that of the Church, and to prove that the Revenue of the
Church  Nation of England were in the year 1660 about Quintuple, to what
they were at the time of the Reformation, I shall say first that Godwin in his
Catalogue of Bishops, makes the Revenue of the Arch-Bishops and Bishops
to be valued at the time of the Reformation near 22000 l. per Annum,
and if we admit the Revenue of the Deans and Chapters, to be double the
Sum, viz. 44000 l. then will the whole Revenue of the Hierarchy appear to
have been then 66000 l. per Annum.
But Dr. Cornelius Burgess, a Man vers'd in the speculative and practick
part of Sacriledge, doth in his Book concerning Sacriledge call'd Two Re|plies,
and Printed Anno 1660, affirm that the Bishops, Deans, and Chap|ters
Lands, were at the end of the late Civil War sold for two Million three
hundred thousand pounds, and he saith, there was offer'd since his Majesties
Restoration seven hundred thousand pounds more to confirm that Sale:
whereby the value of the said Land is made to be in the year 1660, 3 Mil|lions.

And Mr. Prynne in his Printed Speech in the House of Commons on
Monday the 4th of December 1648. touching the satisfactoriness of the Kings
Answers to the Propositions of both Houses, doth in Page 68 there affirm,
That near one half of the Arch-Bishops and Bishops Possessions and Revenues
consists in Impropriations, Tithes, Pensions, and the like; and if we may
suppose the like as to the Revenues of the Deans and Chapters, then accord|ing
to that Estimate will the value of the whole Revenue of the Hierarchy
of our Church be about 6 Millions, the twentieth part whereof, viz. at
twenty years Purchase is 300,000 l. per Annum, and the 12th part of the
same, viz. at 12 years purchase is 500,000 l. per Annum, so that what at the time
of the Reformation was worth but 66000 l. per Annum, was in the Year
1660 worth between 300, and 500000 l. as aforesaid.
In the next place I shall prove the Remainder of my Position that the Re|venue
of the whole Nation is about Quintupled also; for that the Revenue
of the demolished Monasteries was, as my Lord Herbert in his Harry the
8th, makes it 1 hundred 61 thousand pound per Annum, and the Revenue of the
whole Church about Triple to that Sum, viz. About 450000 l. per Annum,
and the Revenue of the whole Nation between triple and quadruple to the
Revenue of the Church, viz. one Million 6 Hundred Thousand Pound per
Annum: but careful Calculators in these times have computed the same to
be about 8 Millions per Annum, which is quintuple to the said 1 Million 6
Hundred Thousand Pound above mentioned.
And as to the proportion of the Trade and Traffick of England encrease|ing
since the Reformation, little more need be added to what
I have before discoursed then that the Customes, which when Queen Eli|zabeth
came to the Crown, made but 36000 l. per Annum, were since 1660,
farm'd at 4 hundred thousand Pound per Annum, and have since that time
made about double that Sum. And because She foresaw that that Branch
of the Revenue would both support the Crown and the Walls of the King|dom,
I mean its Ships and Sea-men, she wisely provided for the encrease of the
Customs and Navigation in her own and future times by the Planting of Vir|ginia,
and was the Foundress of our Trade in the American Plantations, that is
at this day so beneficial to the King and Kingdom, and where no Forraign|ers
can Trade without his Majesties leave (and therefore the Freight both
outwards and homewards is restrain'd to our own Shipping) and where
the Scene of entercourse is agreeable to the Genius of so many of our Pro|testant
Traders of England, and not troubling them with the sight of the
Religion, or with the Study of the Language of Popish Countries. And
as in any great important undertakings, the first projectors or undertakers
do usually but lay the Foundation of Gain for the next comers, thus too
did providence order it to be in the Case of the Spanish Acquests of America,
which were so fatal to the diminution of the strength of Spain, and fortunate
to the encrease of that of England.
And it was by the means of the advancement of the Protestant Religion
that she was so prosperous in her mighty Attempts of advancing Trade
and Navigation. 'Tis notorious how by making her Realm and Asylum to
Forraign oppressed Protestants, She enriched it with the Manufactures they
introduced, in her great Towns and Cities, and where the value of
House-Rent being by that means raised, the Manufacturers were
enforced to work harder, and the encreasing of their corporal hard labour
did tend to the encrease of their Generations and Populacy as it did among
the Israelites in Egypt, and it had a greater tending to that effect, in regard
that our People in their Towns were their own Task-masters, and could
console themselves with the thoughts not of going but being gone out

of Egypt, and they were rendred the more industrious by the knowing
that they were secure from having the fruit of their labours swept away from
themselves and their Children by Arbitrary Confessors and Priests, a thing
that was practised by those who formerly made England in effect but a
Province to Rome, and when more Money was exported hence by Appeals
and Applications to the Court of Rome then is here imported from Ireland,
and when as in Turky men are dicouraged from enriching themselves tho|row
industry and improvement by the Grand Signiors being the general
Heir, our Fore-fathers too were by the Popes being so much here in the
same capacity. In fine, the value of the Benefices of the Divines in those
great Towns, being partly encreas'd by the growing Numbers of the Peo|ple
and their riches, and partly by their liberal contributions did invite thi|ther
such men of Learning to the Pastorage of Souls, as did by their fame
invite more inhabitants, and did keep up those Towns by the Cement of
Religion in such a state, that they were Seminaries of Knowledge to the
Adjacent Countries, and even Magazines of War for the Princes occasions,
as well as Store-houses of Manufacture to be exported: and for this pur|pose
Arch-Bishop Grindal in his Letter to Queen Elizabeth, Anno Domini
1580, Printed in Fullers Church History speaking of able Ministers, being
placed in all Parishes, and of the benefit thereof redounding to Princes by
their Subjects obedience to them, saith, No Prince ever had mre lively ex|perience
hereof, then your Majesty hath had in your time, and may have daily:
and if your Majesty comes to the City of London never so often, what gratula|tion,
what joy, what concourse of people is there to be seen: yea, what Accla|mations
and Prayers to God for your long Life and other manifest significations
are there to be heard of inward and unfeigned love with most humble and hearty
obedience? whereof cometh this, Madam, but of the continual Preaching of
Gods word in that City, whereby the people hath been plentifully instructed in
their Duty toward God and your Majesty? On the contrary, what bred the Re|bellion
in the North? was it not Papistry and Ignorance of Gods word through
want of often Preaching in the time of the Rebellion? Were not all Men of all
States that make profession of the Gospel most ready to offer their lives for your
defence, insomuch that one Parish of Yorkshire which by continual Preaching
hath been better instructed then the rest, Halifax I mean, was ready to bring
3 or 4000 able Men into the Field to serve you against the said Rebels, c.
As I before observed, That the Reformation brought us at the first step,
out of a blind Chaos into a Paradice of knowledge, so I may add that at
the next it conducted us to that blessing of Paradice, Be fruitful and multi|ply,
and replenish the Earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the Fish
of the Sea. No sooner had the Reformation under that Great Queen clear|ed
the heads of her Subjects, but it enlarged their hearts, and substituted
in Men a new brave and generous spirit, in lieu of that dull and formal
and lethargic one that possessed them under the Captivity of their blind
Guides, and they accounted their All and even the Worlds, too little for
their Prince, and they made her Exchequer as spacious as her Kingdom,
and the English Commerce as wide as the World. Navigation and Navi|gators
were her Favourites, and her great States man Walsingham by her
Command animated Frobisher to attempt the discovery of a nearer passage
to Cathay and China, without going so far about as by the Cape of good
hope, and he gave not over that design till after three Voyages, and the
death of Walsingham: and the success of her Politics and of the Reformati|on,
have in despight of all the power of Rome and Spain terminated in such
a multiplying of the Subjects of the Realm of England, as probably ren|ders
them more numerous then the people of the Kingdom of Spain,

which Heylin in his Geography makes to have only Eight Millions of Souls.
But there scarce needs any other Medium whereby to evince that the Pro|gress
of the Reformation hath vastly encreased the value of our Land and
proportion of our Commerce, then that it hath so vastly encreased the num|ber
of our People, a Fact that I have already proved, and have shewn what
Depopulaors or dispeoplers of the Kingdom the Monks were, and have made
some Calculations of the numbers of the Religious Persons living in Celibate,
and the effects thereof in restraining formerly the growth of the Numbers
of the People: but do find that I was extremely short in assigning the num|ber
of those whom Popery made to live in Celibate to be but 120000. I
was glad to gain a rise for somewhat like an Estimate of the numbers of all
the Religious persons in Monasteries by finding it in Weavers Monuments
that the Religious Persons put out of the Religious Houses, under the yearly
value of 200l. were above 10000: and that therein Weaver agrees with
Sanders de Schismate, c. but I made no Estimate of the numbers of Friers
Mendicant the which were very great, and I was too short on the account|ing
that there were perhaps no more Secular Priests then Benefices in Eng|land:
for th the Rule of the Canon Law allows not Orders to be given to
Men without a Title, yet it admits an exception in the Case of Men who can
live on their own patrimony, and it still took the Title to be a Curate as cur|rent
Coyn for one to a living: and moreover the livelihoods that many un|beneficed
Secular Priests acquired by saying particular Masses, did pass for Ti|tles,
and thus in France it being conceived that the Secular Priests unbeneficed
are about 6 times as many as the beneficiaries, we may thence guess what
the proportions of their numbers were in England.
But yet further to discourse of the growth of the numbers of the people
of England before and since the Reformation, I shall acquaint your Lordship
that you may easily find among the Records of the Exchequer, what the
number of the people of England was in the Year 1522, when Harry the
8th (as I cited it out of my Lord Herberts History p. 121,) Caused War|rants
to be Issued out, Commanding the Certificates of the number of all above
16 years old to be returned, and by an Index or Repertory of the Mat|ters
of State in the Exchequer that I have, I can readily direct the find|ing
it out there: and moreover by the accounts of the Pole Acts in
former times, a considerable indication of the numbers of the people in those
days may be had.
And if we may guess at the encrease of the people of England from
that of London, I can easily satisfie any person about the prodigious growth
of that City in numbers of people, and consequently in wealth since the
abandoning of the Papacy.
I have by me an account of the proportions of the Shires of England  City
of London, in a Tax of 50000 l. long since in Edward the 3ds time, and in which
Surry bore the same proportion with London, and in which London and Surry
and Middlesex paid but about 1500l. which was but about a 16th part.
And in Harry the 8ths times, it hapned that Cardinal Pool excited divers
Princes of Christendom to invade England,  a fit man he was who had been
then a Traytor to come here and absolve Hereticks: but Holling shead in
his Chronicle of Harry the 8th, p. 947 tells us, That the King having heard
of the Treasonable practices of the Cardinal, did Anno 1539, make a Survey
of his Naval Strength, and did ride to the Sea-Coasts: and that Sir William
Foreman Knight, then Major of London, was commanded to certifie the names
of all the Men within the City and liberties thereof, between the age of 16 and
60, whereupon the said Mayor and his Brethren each one in his Ward, by the Oath
of the Common-Council and Constable, took the number of Men, Arms, and

Weapons: and after well considering of the matter by view of their Books, they
thought it not expedient to admit the whole number certified for apt and able
men; and therefore assembling themselves again, they chose forth the most able
persons and put by the residue, especially such as had no Armour. But when they
were credibly advertised by Thomas Cromwel Lord Privy-Seal (to whom the
City was greatly beholden) that the King himself would see the People of the
City Muster in a convenient number, and not to set forth all their power, but to
leave some at home to keep the City, c. then he saith, the number beside
the Whifflers and other Waiters was 15000.
But the Observator on the Bills of Mortality, hath in his last Observations
on that Subject told us, That there are in London about 6 hundred and
70000 Souls: and th I know that some Parishes are included within the Bills
of Mortality for the said City that formerly were not, yet the said Observa|tor
having told us that there are in London more Males then Females, and it
being true that there are as many above the Age of sixteen as are under it,
and that the Sexagenarii are but a 6th part of Mankind, and the Quota of
the numbers resulting from the Parishes added, being likewise shewn us
by that Observator, let any one judge how vast the number of able Men
certifiable between 16 and 60, is grown to be since that year of Harry the
8th before mentioned.
It must be acknowledged that the thanks of the Age are due to the Ob|servator
on the Bills of Mortality, for those solid and rational Calculations
he hath brought to light, relating to the numbers of our people: but such
is the modesty of that excellent Author, that I have often heard him wish
that a thing of so great publick importance to be certainly known, might
be so by an actual numbring of them, and the truth is, it is much to be
pittied that by the care of Magistrates, an exact number of the people as
well of London, as of all other places in the Realm, hath not with
diligence been made and preserved, the knowledge whereof is the Substra|tum
of all political measures that can be taken as to a Nations strength or
riches, and the part thereof that is spareable for Colonies, and the value of
the branches of the publick Revenue, and the equality in proportioning
any Taxes or Levies by Act of Parliament, and the satisfying the World
about the value of our Alliances, a thing one would think somewhat neces|sary
when 'tis published in Print that a Forraign Minister, who hath spent
much time here and is deservedly famous for being a Critical Judge in the Po|liticks,
and in many sorts of Learning, makes the people of England to be but
two Millions, and when a late famous French Author of la Politique Fran|coise,
who sets up with his Goose-quill to be a Governor of the World, re|proacheth
us after his manner with the fewness of our people, and saith, How
insolent soever the English are, they must confess that all the Brittish Islands
laid together, do not equal the half of our Continent, either in extent, c. or
number of Men, in Wealth, in Valour, Industry and Vnderstanding.
Mr. Iames Howel in his Londinopolis Printed Anno 1657 saith, That in
the Year 1636, King Charles sending to the Lord Major of London to make a
Scrutiny of what Roman Catholicks there were in London, he took occasion
thereby to make a Cense of all the people, and that there were of Men, Women,
and Children, above 7 hundred thousand that lived within the Barrs of his Iu|risdiction
alone: and this being 21 years ago, 'tis thought by all probable com|putation
that London hath more now by a third part then it had then.
In his Parallel of London there with other great Cities in the World, he
observes that the weekly Bills of Mortality in Amsterdam, come but to
about 60 a week, whence saith he, It may be inferr'd that London is about 5
times as populous, more dying in a week commonly in London then 300.

And as to the quantity of the people in London, there is no doubt to be
made but that if in the year 1636, there lived 700,000 within the Barrs of the
Lord Majors Iurisdiction, there lived then so many more in the other Parishes
within the Bills of Mortality, and that there live in this year within the
Bills of Mortality, more then double the number that did in the year
1636; and at that Rate their number would now amount to near two
Millions.
But I am to suspect that there was no such return of any Cense of the
people within the Barrs of the Lords Majors Iurisdiction in the year 1636
as is before mentioned, and do suppose that Mr. Howel did in that point
mistake, partly for that I think him mistaken in his Allegation before as to
the people of Paris being returned as above a Million of Souls at the last Cnse
made there, and do as to their number give more credit to the Bishop of
Rhodes, who in his History of Harry the 4th, written since the year 1660,
saith in part 2d, That there were in Paris when 'twas block'd up only 200000
persons, and that there were then retired thence 100000 of the Inhabitants,
so that in those times there were no more then 300,000 Souls in Paris, whereas
'tis now believed there are twice as many, and partly because I find it men|tioned
by the curious Observator on the Bills of Mortality, p. 113, and
114. That Anno 1631, Ann. 7. Caroli 1. The number of Men, Women and
Children in the several Wards of London, and Liberties, taken in August,
1631. by special Command of the Lords of his Majesties Privy-Council, came
in all but to 130178, and finally because the said curious Observator (for
that name I give that Author after my Lord Chief Iustice Hales hath given
or adjudged it to him in his Origination of Mankind) having by rational
Calculations proved, that their dyes within the Bills of Mortality a thir|tieth
part or one in thirty yearly, and that there dyes ordinarily there
22000 per Annum, that if there were there according to Howel a Million and
an half of people, it would follow that there must dye but 1 out of 70 per
Annum, and that they must live one with another 70 years.
There is an ingenious Author and that is the Author of the present State
of England, who tells us in his 2d part, That in 1588; there went forth from
the Queen Commissions to Muster in all parts of England, all Men that were of
perfect Sence and Limbs from the Age of 16 to 60, except Noblemen, Clergy|men,
Vniversity, Students, Lawyers, Officers, and such as had any publick charges,
leaving only in every Parish so many Husbandmen as were sufficient to Till the
Ground. In all those Musters there were then numbred three Millions: but of
those fit for War about 600,000.
I would scarce desire better Evidence for an Opinion that the people of
England were in all 12 Millions, then that 3 Millions of Males between 16
and 60 were then returned; for the said Observator having by Calcula|tion
assured us, that there are about as many Females as Males, and about
as many people under the Age of 16 as are above it, the said opinion would
stand firm and unshaken.
There is too another Author who much enlargeth the number of the peo|ple
of England, and that is Gerard Matynes in his Lex Mercatoria first Print|ed
in the year 1622, and there in Cap. 46. he makes them to be 16 Millions
and 800,000: but any one will hardly take his word for it, who considers
that he there makes the people of Scotland to be 9 Millions, who are but
about one Million and reckons 5500 Parishes in Ireland, where there were
never more then 2 thousand 2 hundred Parishes.
But 'tis the fate of Nations to have their numbers sometimes inconside|rately
Assigned by considerable Authors, and thus it happened particularly
to France from an error of Campanella who in his discourse of the Spanish Mo|chy,

C. 24. saith that France hath in it 27000 Parishes, and 100 and 50
Millions of Souls.
At this rate there would be in the Parishes in France one with another
5555 Souls, whereas Sir W. P. in a Manuscript discourse of his, saith, That
a substantial Author in his Treatise concerning France, sets it down as an
extraordinary Case if a Parish in France hath in it 600 Souls.
We have too an Author of great Vogue for the Politicks, Sir Robert Cot|ton
who in his Abstract of the Records of the Tower, touching the Kings Reve|nue
hath these words, viz. That London (which is not the 24th part in peo|ple
of the Kingdom) had in it found above 800,000, by a late enquiry by the
Order of the late Queen, meaning Queen Elizabeth.
But so far have we been from enabling our Political Writers to satisfie
themselves in the Numbers of our People, that we have not done it yet as
to the very Numbers of Parishes, wherein Blunt tells us in his Law Lexicon
that our Authors differ; and we generally reckon them as they were before
many new ones have been built.
One late writer has accounted the Parishes in England and Wales to be
10260: and Mr. Adams sayes in his Villare Anglicum p. 408. That he is of
opinion that there are about 1500 Parishes in England and Wales not valued in
the Kings Books, and of which he can get no account so as to make the same per|fect,
and 'twill be difficult for him to do it, unless the several persons concern'd in
the particulars give an account of it.
Cambden in his Britannia Printed Anno 1607, when he reckons the Pa|rish
Churches in the Bishoprick of Durham and in Northumberland to be
118, adds praeter sacella plurima: and saith in Yorkshire, Parishes besides
Chappels, and Parishes to which many Chappels are subject that are equal to great
Parishes, c.
Moreover the Grants from the Crown of Extraparochial Titles in seve|ral
Counties, may serve for an indication of great numbers of people that
are not Inhabitant in Parishes, and so likewise may the Multitudes of those
people who live in Forrests, and which places are generally accounted by
the Law to be Extraparochial.
The Number of Parsonages and Vicarages in Edward the 1sts valuation,
whereof there is a Manuscript Copy in the Bodleian Library was about 8900,
and into that number the Chappels are not accounted; but of the Chap|pels
many since have grown up into Parsonages: and this would likewise
induce one to think the number of our Parishes at this time to be greater
then the common Estimate, especially when according to the Kings Books
which respect the valuation in Harry the 8ths, time, the number of them is
considerably above 9000.
But what may seem more strange is that some men of Thought and Learn|ing
have attempted even by Calculation, to prove that the people of England
have for a very long space of time decreased in their numbers, and particu|larly
the Author of a Book in Quarto called, An account of the French Vsur|pation
on the Trade of England, and the great damage the English yearly su|stain
by their Commerce, Printed in the Year 1679, and Writ with excel|lence
of Calculation in some parts thereof: and yet that Author doth p. 16
say, And I can easily believe that 1000 years since, this Nation had a much
greater stock of people then now it hath, for the Rome-Scot, or Peter-pence
which was but one Penny a Chimney (granted by Offa and Ina Saxon Kings to
the Pope) did amount to 50000 yearly: and the Hearth-money, which is
two Shillings the Hearth (and one Stack of Chimneys may have many Hearths)
doth not amount to 300,000l. yearly; whereas if the number of Chimneys
charged with the Romescot had been two Shillings a Chimney, it would have

amounted to 1,200,000 l. yearly. So that we may conclude there were then more
Buildings and Chimneys, and so by consequence more people.
But had that Author considered that the Romescot or denarius sancti Petri
was only an annual Penny from every Family or Houshold, and that it
amounted to 300 Marks and a Noble yearly, as Blunt says, by that reckoning it
would have appeared that there were not then in all England 50000 Families
liable to that Duty, whereas there are now above a Million of such Families: so
that now the people and Families of England are twenty times as many as
they were then, which agrees pretty well with my Lord Chief Iustice Hales's
reckoning.
That great person in his Primitive Origination of Mankind, yields that
the people of England are at least 6 Millions, and doth too in Page 205,
say, That he doth not know any thing rendred clearer to the view, then the gra|dual
encrease of Mankind by the curious and strict Observations on the Bills of
Mortality: and doth very elaborately make a comparison between the num|bers
of the people in Glocestershire, and particularly some great Towns and
Burroughs there, as Thornbury and Tedbury as they were at the time of the
making up of Domesday Book and as they now are, and shews, That there
are very many more Vills and Hamlets now then there were then, and few
Villages or Towns or Parishes then which continue not to this day, and that the
number of Inhabitants now is above 20 times more through the general extent of
the Country then at that time: and afterward saith, if we should institute a la|ter
Comparison, viz. between the present time and the beginning of Queen Eli|zabeth,
which is not above 112 years since, and compare the number of Trained
Soldiers then and now, the number of Subsidy men then and now, they will easily give
us an account of a very great encrease and multiplication of people within this
Kingdom even to admiration.
It would be no difficult thing to fortifie the observation of the great gra|dual
encrease of the people, and particularly of those in the Parishes of Glo|cestershire,
by the shewing the encrease of their worth and riches in the se|veral
publick Valuations, and their present real value, from whence their
growth in the numbers of their Inhabitants may be well inferr'd; as for ex|ample
in Edward the 1sts Valuation, Tedbury is valued, Ecclesia de Tedbury
36. m. i. e. Marks, and in Harry the 8ths Valuation, is valued at 36l. 13s 2d,
and is now worth about 100 l. per Annum. Thornbury in Edward the 1sts
valuation is valued at 47 Marks and a half, and in Harry the 8ths to 32l.
14s. 8d. and is now worth about 120 l. per Annum. Berkley in Edward the
1sts Valuation comes to 36 Marks and a half, and in Harry the 8ths to 32l.
14s. 8d. and is now worth about 100 l. per Annum.
I have instanced in these places, as referred to by Hales, and shall here
as to Gloster only further observe, that there are more places in the Decanatus
Glocestriae in Harry the 8ths valuation, then were in Edward the 1sts: as
for instance, Edward the 1sts Valuation doth in the rural Deanry of Glo|cester
comprize 6 Churches and a Chappel, but Harry the 8th doth in the
Deanery contain above 20 Churches and a Chappel.
I shall here corroborate his Lordships remark of the encrease of Families
in another Town in Glocestershire, which he calls Dursilege, and which is in
Edward the 1sts Valuation called Dursly, and valued as a rectory there at 10
Marks per Annum, and in Harry the 8ths as a Rectory at 10 l. 14s. 3d. and
is now let for 72 l. yearly.
I have observ'd a suitable difference between the former valuations of
other Livings in that County and their present real values.
His Lordship having before justly acknowledged that it was a
laborious piece of work to make a Calculation of the number of Inhabitants

at this day throughout England; did however in a way very worthy of his
great judgment adapt his Estimate to the extent of one entire County; for
had he gone less, and restrained it to this or that Parish, the gradual en|crease
of the People there, might have fallen short by particular accidents;
and to this purpose we have it in Mr. Bentham's Christian Conflict, p. 322.
that 11 Mannors in Northamptonshire have been enclosed with depopulation,
and have vomited out their former desolate owners and their posterity.
Many ingenious persons have applyed their thoughts to several ways of
Calculation whereby to discover the total of the number of the People in
England, and in the Investigation thereof some concern'd in the manage|ment
of the Hearth-money have reckon'd that in England and Wales the
number of Hearths of rich and poor is 2 Millions and 6 hundred thousand, and
that at a Medium there are between 4 and 5 persons to a Hearth, and ac|counting
but 4 persons to a Hearth, they suppose that at that rate the peo|ple
of England and Wales will appear to be 10 Millions.
The slowness of believing great things which is incident to Humane Na|ture,
and my inclination to desire that any thing may be proved to me by
ocular Demonstration, where the Subject Matter will bear it, do make me
as to any of the greater forementioned Quotas of the People of England
contended for by Calculators, to reserve my Judgment till some such accu|rate
Survey hath been made thereof, as I have heard Sir W. P. that Mathe|matical
Stats-man wish for.
But this I will venture to affirm, that by what may be observed out of the
Returns on the late Pole-Bills, and the Bishops Survey, 'tis very highly
probable that the Total of the number of the people here will upon
any actual view hereafter to be made by publick Authority, appear
very considerably greater then any cautious Calculators have made it.
Another account of the same great Quaesitum was sent me into the Coun|try
from a Gentleman of London, who acquainted me that he received the
same from a very knowing and ingenious person whom the late Lord Trea|surer,
as great a Master of the Science of Numbers as perhaps ever any that
Acted in that high Sphere of State, employed to effect an Impartial Return
of the number of the people in London and in Middlesex, and every other
County both in England and Wales, and the Total resulting from them
was as I cast up the same 8,272,062. But I judge that this account was not
taken upon ocular View of the several Counties, but by way of Estimate
not absolutely perfect, and by Calculation or comparing several former ac|counts
together.
There is no doubt but the most satisfactory way that we can at present
take for our Estimates, and whereby we may Trace the Numbers of the
people from somewhat that looks like matter of Record is, as I hinted,
from the Returns on the Pole Bill and the Bishops Survey.
And as to the Poll-money of Anno 1666, 2 hundred thirty seven thousand
Pound was the gross Charge: and if on the consideration of Counties
whereof the Charge was not returned, as Buckinghamshire, Durham, Nor|thumberland,
Kent, Oxon, North Wales, Brenoc, Radnor, Glamorgan, Pem|broke,
(of which the proportions in numbers with the Counties return'd
are not hard to be Calculated) and of the omissions perhaps through partia|lity
whereby great numbers of persons chargeable were not returned, and
withal on a supposal that there had been in the Act no qualifications and
exceptions of many persons from being Charged, and particularly of per|sons
under the Age of Sixteen, and of Paupers, c. we may further venture
to make the Total chargeable to be 600,000 l. and every one paying for his
Head, there would then apppear 20 times as many people, i. e. 12 Millions.

I know that out of such a Sum as 600,000 l. supposed chargeable, it
will be obvious to consideration that what was paid by the Nobility and by
Titlers and Officers must be substracted: but when it shall be likewise consi|dered
that in that Poll-money that of the Peers paid into the Receipt, came
to but 5693 l. 6s. 8d. and that perhaps as much went beside the Nett of the
Receipt under the notion of imaginary Paupers, and by persons not return'd; as
came into it from the Officers and Titlers, and that the persons excepted un|der
the Age of 16 were about a Moiety of the people, the supposition of
600,000 l. chargeable by way of Capitation will not seem so strange as at
the first view.
The great difficulty of having the Total of the people chargeable by any
Poll-Bill exactly and impartially return'd, appears in the Case of a Poll|Tax
in Holland.
The Author of the Interest of Holland mentions that Anno 1622, The
Tax of Poll-money was laid on all the Inhabitants of Holland, and none ex|cepted
but Prisoners and Vagrants, and those that were on the other side the
Line, and all strangers, and that then there were found in South Holland no more
then 481934 Souls, though yet the Commissioners instructions were strict for the
making true returns, and the particular returns are thus Registred in the
Chamber of Accounts, viz.

Dort with the Villages, 40523.
Harlem with the Villages, 69648.
Delft with the Villages, 41744.
Leyden and Rynland, 94285.
Amsterdam and the Villages, 115022.
Goud with the Villages, 24662.
Rotterdam with the Villages, 28339.
Gornichem with the Villages, 7585.
Schiedam with the Villages, 10393.
Schoonhoven with the Villages, 10703.
Briel with the Villages, 20156.
The Hague, 17430.
Heusden, 1444.

In all 481934.
And supposing that West Friesland may yield the 4th part of the Inhabitants of South Holland, it would amount to 120483.
In all 602417.
The Author there delivers his opinion, That many evaded the being re|turn'd
on that Poll, and that the number return'd was very short and defective,
but adheres to the account of them being now as is before mentioned, viz.
2 Millions 4 hundred thousand.
And this as it doth in some measure fortifie my foregoing notion of the
prodigious growth of the people of Holland under the Reformation, so it
doth likewise afford an instance of the partiality used in the returns of the
numbers chargeable in Poll-Money.
But that which doth chiefly induce me to believe the Total of our num|bers
may very much exceed the sentiments of Cautious Calculators in this
point, is the Result of the Bishops Survey, which was made for the Province
of Canterbury, and wherein none under the age of Communicants or 16
were return'd, and but very few Servants, or Sons, and Daughters, or Lodg|ers,
or Inmates of the people of several perswasions of Religion: and the

thing endeavour'd was that the heads of Families or House-Keepers, i. e.
Man and Wife might be truly return'd; and at that rate, the Total at the
foot of the account for the Province of Canterbury is 2,228,386, the
which according to the forementioned currant Rule of Calculation to be ne|cessarily
about doubled on the account of the people under 16, makes the
Total of the Souls in that Province to be 4 Millions, 4 Hundred 56 thou|sand,
7 hundred seventy two; and the Province of York bearing a sixth part of
the Taxes, and having therefore the 6th. part of the people that the Pro|vince
of Canterbury hath, which is 742,795, that being added to those
of Canterbury, makes 5 Millions, a hundred ninety nine thousand, five hun|dred
sixty seven: and since 'tis apparent that not more persons were return|ed
in that Survey then did really exist in Nature, and live within the
Province as return'd, it will hereafter seem a very unnecessary thing and in|deed
absurd to question whether the people of England were not then at
least 5,199,567.
But since it appears by the inspection of that Survey, that there was so
vast a quantity of places that made no returns at all, some of which present|ly
occur'd to my view in the Cursory reading and taking some few Notes
thereof, and without my designing to make any Collection of all the places
that made no returns, as for example, in the Arch-Deaconry of Colchester,
11 Parishes made no returns, and in the Decanatus Tendring twelve
Parishes, in the Decanatus Colcestre seven Parishes, in the Decanatus
Lexden ten Parishes, in Decanatus Witham eleven Parishes, in the
Arch-Deaconry of Middlesex and Decanatus Braugling and Harlow four|teen
Parishes, in the Decanatus Dunmo 7 Parishes, in the Decanatus Henning|am
9 Parishes, in the Decanatus of Middlesex 16 Parishes (some of which
were St. Clements Danes, St. Mary le Bow, Vxbridge) and in the Arch|Deacony
of London St. Bartholomew Exchange, are therein express'd to have
made no returns; it may hence seem rational for any Man to suppose in
general that the number of the People of England rever is very great be|yond
the said total of 5,199,567. and that it would have risen to a much
greater number if exact returns had been made of all the heads of Families
in England and Wales; and much more if all Persons in all Families above
the Age of 16 had been return'd.
But yet according to the Returns that were de facto made in that Survey,
I observ'd that in some, where the totals for Counties were cast up, that they
doubled the totals of the People return'd for the same Counties, upon the
Poll Act of 66. as for example, the Poll for Devonshire and Cornwel was four|teen
thousand three hundred Pound; and the number return'd for those Coun|ties
by the Bishops Survey was two hundred and thirteen thousand, doubling
which number for those under the Age of Communicants there, makes
426000 Souls there; so then the 14000 l. at 12 d. the Head makes there
280000 Shillings, or Persons at 12 d. a Head, to which as I shew'd the
number in the Bishops Survey is double.
And further to shew the Omissions of great Numbers of People, return|able
in that Survey, I shall acquaint your Lordship that in the year 1676.
in the which the Bishops Survey was made, there dy'd within the Bills of
Mortality 18730. and according to the rule of 1 in 30. there yearly dying,
there will be suppos'd to have then liv'd there 533,170. and the total of the
People return'd of all Persuasions of Religion above the Age of 16 in the
whole Diocess of London in the year 76. was 286,347. and the doubling of
that number for those under the Age of 16 in that Diocess, makes the total of
the People there then to be 572,694. But here it is to be Considered that
tho the Peculiars of the Arch-Bishoprick of Canterbury in London were de

facto return'd then within the Survey of the Diocess of London, yet the great
and populous Parishes in Southwark and others in Surry within the District of
the Bills of Mortality, were not return'd with any respect to the Diocess of
London, but were in that Survey by the Bishop of Winton return'd as belong|ing
to his Lordships Diocess; and that in a late year of ordinary health,
viz. in Anno 1677. there dyed in the Parishes in Surry, that are within the
Bills of Mortallity 2803. and therefore according to the Rule of the 30th.
part then dying there, it is to be judged that there then lived there, 81287.
and therefore we being to Substract that last mention'd Number out of the
533,170, then the number of all the Souls in the other Places in the Bills of
Mortallity will be 451,983. and so at that rate the number of all the Souls
within the whole Diocess of London, will be but 120,711 more then those
that were in the other Places within the Bills of Mortallity, the which Dio|cess
takes in all the other Places in Middlesex that are without the Bills of
Mortallity, and all Essex, and part of Hartfordshire. And to conclude this
point, the omissions of Great Parts of the Numbers of the People, and par|ticulary
of Sons, Daughters, Servants, being supposed to be in other places
proportionable; I am hence induced to believe that on the occasion of any
actual and exact Survey of the People of England to be made, their num|ber
will rise to a greater height then what it hath been advanced to by the
most judicious Calculators.
And now if after all this, one should tell me that any vast encrease of
the numbers of the People of England beyond the quota supposed by Cauti|ous
Calculators, is incredible, and to be added to the number of things in|credible;
I will answer him out of Salust, Incredibile est memoratu, quantum
adepta libertate, in brevi Romana Civitas creverit; and will tell him, that
'tis almost incredible to relate how much we have gain'd by our abandoning
Popery and its Incredibility, and the almost incredibile as well as intolerable
Servitude, that the Papacy so often oppressed both our Kings and People
with.
We are told by the Observator on the Bills of Mortallity, that anxiety of
mind hinders Breeding, and from sharp anxieties of divers kinds hath the Pro|testant
Religion rescued English minds, and from their former daily yariness
for their daily Bread, and their fears of being Arbitrarily dispossest of it.
What Princes (as I may say) are the English Infantry, and even the Boors
of Holland to the Pesants of France, who with Chains on do propagate
their Species, and Servitude it self? And what pity was it that Commerce
which with its infant Smiles cheer'd our Isle in the Reign of Edward the
6th. was almost frighted away from it by the Frowns and Arbitrary Pra|ctices
of Queen Mary; and that after that Edward the 6th. consulting the
Advancement of our Trade had legally Suppressed the Corporation of Mer|chant-Strangers,
and null'd their Monopoly; Queen Mary endeavour'd the
Suppression of our Native Merchants, and that too by Illegal Impositions.
It is not denyable that in the fourth year of her Reign she did lay an Im|post
upon our Cloth: and one who had been a Iudge of the Realm, and
who had no spight to her Story mentioning it in his Book call'd, The
Rights of the People Concerning Impositions, saith there, This Religious Prince
Inviron'd with infinite Troubles in the Church and Commonwealth, and Impo|verish'd
by her Devotion in Renouncing the Profits of the Church Lands that
were in the Crown, was the first that made Digression from the steps of her wor|thy
Progenitors, in putting on that imposition without assent of Parliament:
And the same Author in pag. 91. mentions another unjust Imposition of
hers on Gascoyn Wines.

And her expulsion of the Dutch Church and their Pastors from London,
and her Canselling of the Legal Priviledges that Edward the 6th. (for him|self,
his Heirs and Successors gave them, and other Strangers by his Let|ters
Patents, was an Arbitrary blow given to the Trade of the Kingdom
in general, and of that City in particulars; The Copy of her Proclamation
for the Expelling them is Printed in Fox, in which they are stiled, a Multi|tude
of evil disposed Persons being Born out of her Highnesses Dominions in
other sundry Nations, flying from the Obeysance of the Princes and Rulers,
under whom they be Born, some for Heresie, some for Murther, Treason, Robbe|ry;
and are there further represented as such, whose secret practices have not
fail'd to stir her Highnesses Subjects to a Rebellion against God and her Grace,
c. But secret Traitors they were found by the Realm, and secret they
were left by it. Two of them were Iohn a Lasco, Uncle to the King of
Poland, and Peter Martyr, that were thus sent out of the Realm with San|benitos
on: and so far were our Popish Ancestors from Hospitality to
Strangers, and thereby unawares entertaining Angels, that they made
Devils of them, and as such used them: and to make amends to the multi|tude
of Forraign Artists for the Gold they brought here, they had the Dirt
of Shams thrown at them by a Proclamation.
And as if not only the Biting, but the very Barking of Mad Doggs had
power to make others Mad, she grew so enraged by the Books of Heresie
and Sedition, Printed in Forraign Parts and here Imported, that she Pub|lish'd
a Proclamation Printed likewise in Fox, wherein she Declared to all
her Subjects that, Whoever shall after the Proclaiming hereof be found to have
any of the said Wicked and Seditious Books, or finding them do not forthwith
Burn the same without shewing or reading the same, shall in that Case be Re|puted
and taken for a Rebel, and shall without delay be Executed for the Offence
according to the order of Martial Law.
But nothing can palliate the Arbitrariness of Queen Mary's Proclamation,
for the Exercising of Martial Law, but that she thought her Reign a time
of War, and perhaps not altogether Improperly; for that Hereticks have
the Title of Hostes given them by Popish Masters of Ceremonies.
There was another reason that induced Queen Mary to use the Arbitrary
Power, that her Popish Predecessors did not, and that is this: The People of
England in the days of Popery were like to the three Fools in Lipsius, that be|ing
ty'd together by a twine Thread, went Whining about the House, and con|senting
that they who would unty the Knots of it, should have what Money from
them they pleas'd: And thus were our Foolish Ancestors innodated with Papal
Censures, and the Priests did but Arbitrarily ask and have their rewards to
Absolve them. But that Queen finding that the Reformation begun had
proved Physick to Cure those Idiots of their dull Stupidity, she therefore
supposed that the Fools who before were held by the twine Thread, must
then be bound to the good Behaviour with Chains.
In fine, by these three Important Acts of Arbitrary Power (the which
presently occurred to my remembrance out of her Story, and without my
troubling my self to rake for more) she gave the alarm to her Subjects
newly after their Eyes had been opened, and their Hands unty'd by the
Reign of K. Edward, that they were to expect no free Trading where there
was no free Living, and to hear nothing but the dying Groans of Liberty
and Religion. So very exact indeed is the Frame of our English Govern|ment,
and of the Soveraignes Power and Peoples Liberty therein, that as
in an Arched Building, if one Stone be removed from it, the whole is im|mediately
endanger'd, and nothing could probably have saved it from ru|in,
but the Restoration of our Law as well as Gospel, by such a Reign as

Queen Elizabeths, who was so far from the exercise of Arbitrary Power on
her good Subjects and Friends, that she did it not on the worst, nor on her
Enemies.
One would have thought that after the many attempts against her Life,
and after the forementioned threatning Letter of Campians, which notifies
that the Iesuits had entred into a Covenant or Association to Kill Heretical
Princes, c. that she might have been provoked to have declared that Order
by a Proclamation to be Hostes, a thing that she or any Protestant Crown'd
Heads might do without Violating the Laws of Nations in reference to
those Forraign Princes that were their Allies, and to whom any of that Or|der
were Subjects: a thing not only Consonant to the jus gentium, but to our
Lex terrae as it was resolv'd in Cambden's Elizabeth; by the Lord Chief
Justice Catelin, who being ask'd, Whither the Subjects of another Prince,
Confederate with the Queen, might be held for the Queens Enemies? Answer'd,
That they might, and that the Queen of England might make War with any
Duke of France, and yet in the mean time hold Peace with the French King;
and a thing that if done, would have tended more to their Extermina|tion
out of this or any Country perhaps, then all other Laws against them,
in regard that it would have more effectually bereav'd them of the benefit
of Correspondence, Aids and Assistance from thence; all Subjects being
every where by the Law rendred Traytors, who Correspond with, or give
Aid and Assistance to declared Enemies.
Nor would the term of Hostes bestow'd on such be more then a Retaliati|on;
and to this purpose Mariana makes the people authoriz'd to Proclaime
a King upon occasion, to be a Publick Enemy: and so likewise Lessius even
in his Book de Iustiti  jure, saith, That a Tyrant is to be declared an Ene|my
by the Common-welth: and thus Parsons alias Doleman in his Book of the
Succession, Part 2. Cap. 4. terms an Evil King an Armed Enemy.
The term I mention'd before of inimicus homo is certainly proper enough
for those that sow such Tares in the World as the Iesuites do, and make not
only Lollards of ordinary Hereticks, but as the Commenter on the Epitome of
Confessions, otherwise the 7th. Book of Decretals tells us in Commendation
of all the Iesuits in these words, Tyrannos aggrediuntur, lolium ab agro Domi|nico
evellunt.
I shall here observe how in the year 1596. the Hollanders and others of
the States of the Vnited Provinces did Publish an Edict, That none of the
Bloudy Sect of the Jesuits, or any that gives himself to Study at this time a|mong
the Professors of that Sect, whether he be Brn in any of the Provinces
that are Confederate, or be a Forraigner crept secretly into the same Province,
should longer remain there then the time prescribed, under the pain of being
accounted and kill'd for an Enemy.
But that Magnanimous Queen did as much think it Inglorious for her to
employ her Anger in such a Proclamation on such firy pedants, as I believe
our potent Neighbouring Monarch, whose Name will look as great in all
uture Story, for mighty dilligence, and for exact prudence in the Conduct
of his Affairs of State, as for the Success of his Arms, would to Honour
with the Title of Enemies such little great talkers, who here in the Coffee|Houses
Arraign his Political Measures.
And the truth is, as it is not worthy the Grandeur of Princes, who are
Heavens Vice-gerents to squander away its thunder, in experiments on
Shrubs and Mushrooms, or on slight grounds, to call any of slight man|kind,
and who are of no Name, by that dreadful one of Enemies, a name
that the Impotent passion of Subjects makes them so familiarly vex one a|nother
with, and thereby shews them not such fit depositaries of Heavens

Artillary as Soveraigns are; so is it extremely unbecoming the Glorious
height to which the Doctrine of the Cross hath exalted humane Nature,
for men (as I may say) to decend from Heaven to Earth for Dirt, and to
Hell for Fire-brands to throw at one another, and petulantly to call those
that were sometime Aliens and Enemies in their mind, c. always such after
the Divine reconciliation, or even to manage the most lawful and just War,
Sine quadam bene volenti, as St. Austines words are, or to think that they can
justly assume the great Name first used at Antioch, and yet retain a Constant
and Stated enmity against any Person whatsoever; For according to the
Excellent saying of Tertullian, Christianus nullius est hostis.
But the Bosome of that wise Princess was no resting place for Anger, and
all the Popes Thunder could not discompose her; and as in all Games
they who in their play retain a Constant Equabillity of mind, are generally
most Successful; so was she in the great Political Game she play'd, by being
Semper eadem; and the Papal Excommunications seem'd to her as despicable,
as the Curses of loosing Gamesters: and I doubt not but by her Prudent and
just Administration of the Government of Church and State, she hath laid
the Foundation of the English Nations being Semper eadem in the Royal
Line, and of the Protestant Religions being so too, and that no delen|dam
fore can Issue out against either; (humanly Speaking) and that any Popish
Successor that can come here will find it his interest to use the Politicks of
Queen Mary, as a Sea Mark to avoid, and Queen Elizabeth's as a Land Mark
to go by; and it being clear accordingly as Sir W. P. in his Manuscript dis|course
called, Verbum Sapienti, demonstrates it, Cap. 2. of the Value of the
People, that each Head of Man-kind is as certainly valuable as Land, that
the many Strangers who have Transplanted themselves hither need never
fear that they will be so undervalued as in the Marian days.
The Families of French Protestants that have lately come here have filled
800. of the Empty New Built Houses of London, and have given us too an
occasion of entertaining Angels in those untenanted Houses whose Ruinous
appearance before made them seem to the vulgar such as they call haunted;
but from which no Prince can ever think of exorcising the inhabitants with|out
Conjuring away his own Revenue, of which about one moity depends
on that City, and where the Rents, tho fallen as I say, would yet have been
much lower but for the Tenancy of these Forreigners, and the expectation of
others.
There is a very great President in our English Story, and that is of a
Prince of the Popish perswasion, and yet one who was a sharp persecuter
of the Extravagances of the Power of the Pope and his Clergy, and one who
by the Introducing of Forreignors here to Manufacture our Wooll saved the
Life or Being of the Nations Trade, which his Predecessors had left in a
Gasping Condition, and one who by his Patronizing of Wiclif sufficiently
shew'd that if those Forreigners had been Wiclifists, he would yet have
been a Fautor of those Hereticks, and one who more disoblig'd the Pope
by seizing on the Lands of the Alien Othodox Clerical Idlers, then he
could have done by the entertainment of many Heterodox lay Alien Ma|nufacturers.
'Tis needless to say that I here mean our great Edward the
third, of whom and of Queen Elizabeth, the prudence was as memorable,
as of any Princes that ever Sate on the English Throne; And I will never
despaire of any Heroick Prince here, of the Roman Catholick perswasion,
with his Scepter upholding the trade of the Kingdom, as those two great
Names did, and that too by the same methods, if ever he shall come to find
it in the tottering Conditon that they did; and it may be well supposed
that the experience the Kingdom hath since gained under King Iames and

the Royal Martyr, and His Present Majesty, of the publick benefit that hath
arisen from the reception of Forraign Artists, who have been Heterodox in
some ritual points about our Religion, will make their expulsion seem a
Solecisme: And every Sagacious Person will (I believe) accord with me
that the Spider hath done much more good to humane kind by furnishing it
with the Invention of Weaving, then harm by any thing of Poyson.
I shall be glad to know from your Lordship, whether on your search
among the Records of State, either in the Exchequer or Paper-Office, you
can find Foot-steps of any thing like those returns of the Numbers of the
People in London mentioned out of Howel and Cotton.
I am sure that the knowledge of the Numbers of our People ought by
Statesmen to be accounted their , and in this conjuncture, as the
opus diei, and to pass no longer for a , and that those of them who
take their measures either of the publick Strength or Revenue without
respect to this, are but State-Ethusiasts, and such who in their reckonings
do according to our Common Phrase reckon without their Host, and do not
govern their Politicks by the Arithmetick the Scripture suggests, in the
question of What King goeth to make War against another King, sitteth not
down first and Consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that
cometh against him with twenty thousand?
Bodin in his de Republic, speaking of the Numbering of the People, saith,
That the benefit that redounds to the Publick thereby is infinite: and that
thereby Princes and States know what Souldiers they may have, and what Num|bers
they may send abroad to Collonys.
I have been informed by a Person belonging to the Custom-house, that
near 10000. Persons have had their Names entred as gone out of the Ports
of London and Bristol, for our Plantations in a years time: And no doubt
but the Number was great that then went away thither from other Ports,
and likewise of such that went from London and the out-Ports, whose Names
were not entred. But I was not a little surprised of late, when I read it in
a Book newly Printed, called, The Negros and Indians Advocate, and Dedi|cated
to the Lord Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, where the Author pag. 171.
Speaking of the Kidnappirs trade or mistery, saith, A Trade, that tis
thought Carrys off and Consumes not so little as 10000. out of this Kingdome
yearly, which might have been a Defence to their Mother Country, c.
'Tis certainly a sign that we are very rich in the number of our People,
when we can endure such a quantity of them to be yearly stolen, with|out
the pursuit of a Hue and Cry.
Yet in this point Scotland is reported to be somewhat more unhappy
then England, for those who go hence for our Plantations do Contribute
some way to the Trade of the Kingdom, and many of them return hither
again; But Mr. Roger Coke in his Book called, Englands Improvements, pag.
21. saith, Its believed above 12000. of the Kings Scotish Subjects yearly go
out of Scotland into Poland, Sweden, Germany, France, Holland, and other
places, and never after return into Scotland: And that Author having be|fore
in the same page mentioned, That 5 l. given with an Apprentice to be
instructed in the Woollen or any Manufacture, by which means be afterward
earns 30 l. per annum, this in 20. years becomes 600 l. c. which is more
valuable to the Nation then if 600 l. had been given it, and the People not
employed: Thereupon he afterward Computes, That the benefit which
might accrue to the Nation by employing so many thousands of the Scottish Sub|jects
there might in 20. years time be above 6 Millions. And according to
the opinion of that Worthy Gentleman, we may further be inclined to
think the Number of the Scots removing into Forraign parts to be very

great, when we find among Sir Iohn Denhams Poems, one with this In|scription
or Title, On my Lord Crofts, and my Iourney into Poland, from
whence we brought 10000 l. for his Majesty, by the Decimation of his Scotish
Subjects there.
But moreover the satisfying the Inquisite genius of our People, concerning
the greatness of their Numbers, may be of some importance to them and
the publick quiet, in satisfying them of the Vanity of the former Moddel|lers
of a Republick here, a form of Government tho easily supposed Practi|cable
in large Cities, yet not so in great and populous Nations; and like|wise
of the Vanity of all fears of a Vniversal Monarchy, bridling the world
again, a thing which though it was of old feasable, when Mankind made
not so mighty a Mass, is now far from being so.
'Twas easie to imagine it possible, and indeed to effect it in the days
when Aristotle taught men, that no City ought to have above 10000. Citiz|ens;
and when, however the Number of Citizens was grown at Athens to
20000. and when in the Roman Empire the number of the Citizens was
not so vast as is by many imagined; and so accordingly the Excellent
Discourser de Magnitudine Roman Lipsius, lib. 1. cap. 7. then Speaking of
the Multitudo Romanorum under Augustus, saith, Ipse de se in Lapide Ancyrano
clare hoc dicit. In consulatu suo Sexto lustrum condidisse: quo lustro Censita
sunt Civium Romanorum Capita quadragiens Centum millia  Sexaginta tria,
i. e. four Millions and a hundred thousand: And Lipsius afterward mention|ing,
that the Number of the Romans encreased under Claudius cites Tacitus
for making it then Sexagies movies centena Sexaginta quatuor Millia, i. e.
about seven Millions.
There is no doubt but the People of the Provinces did vastly exceed that
Number; but since according to the estimate of Bodin in his de Rep. 'tis pro|bable
that the Roman Empire, when at its greatest extent in Trajans time, scarce
contain'd the thirtieth part of the World, and that the prolifit North stiled ge|nerally
by Authors officina  vagina gentium by the encrease of its populacy,
so humbled the Roman Sword, that within about 154. years afterward some
of the Roman Emperors became their Allies, and Gallus submitted
to pay Tribute to the Goths, tis no wonder that the thirtieth part of the
World was since reduced to cease from domineering over all the other parts
of it: And notwithstanding Maximines boast to the Senate in the frag|ment
of his account to them of his German Successes, cited by Iul. Ca|pitolinus
in his Life, tantum Captivorum abduxi ut vix Sola Romana sufficiant,
his Resvery of the Immortality of the Roman Power on the Stage of the
World was liable to Confutation from the same way of arguing, as his Con|ceit
of his own Immortality was; which having been observed to have
tainted his fancy on the occasion of his great and robust Body, the same
Capitolinus in his Life saies was corrected by a Players reciting these Lines on
the Stage in his presence:
Qui ab uno non potest a multis occiditur,
Elephans grandis est  occiditur,
Leo fortis est  occiditur,
Tigris fortis est  occiditur,
Cave multos si Singulos non times.
But what I find by Lipsius in the second Book, third Chapter there cited
out of Tertullian is much more applicable to the present State of the World,
then to that wherein twas Writ: He saith there, At Tertulliani locum non
insuper habeo, qui egregie asserit Copiam hominum, cultum orbis in suo, i. e.

Severi Saeculo. De anim Cap. 30. Cert quidem ipse orbis in promptu est, cul|tior
de die,  instructior pristino. Omnia jam pervia, omnia nota, omnia
negotiosa. Solitudines famosas retr fundi amaenissimi obliteraverunt: Sylvas
arva domuerunt: feras pecora fugaverunt: Arenae Seruntur, Saxa panguntur,
Raludes eliquantur. Tantae urbes quantae non casae quondam. Iam nec Insulae
horrent, nec Scopuli terrent: ubique domus, ubique populus, ubque Resp. ubique
vita. Summum testimonium frequentiae humanae, onerosi sumus Mundo. Vix
nobis elementa sufficiunt,  necessitates arctiores,  querelae apud omnes, dum
jam nos Natura non sustinet.
Then adds Lipsius, Nihil impressius dici potest de pleno frequentique
orbe.
And that strong and populous Nations Conspired to break their Chains
hath nothing of wonder in it; and the truth is, the freedom the World
has gain'd since the decay of the Roman Empire, and even by means there|of,
hath hung out such a Picture before all mens Eyes, of Populous Man|kind,
drawn to the bigness of the Life, as has made the Notion of erecting
another Vniversal Monarchy, seem but a Portraiture of Imagination, con|taining
nothing but bold Strokes of Colour, without regular Proportion
and Design; and the Copying only a Landskip of the Devil's Mountain, and his
shewing thence all the Kingdoms of the World.
How is the World ashamed now of its having been in the last foregoing
Age, amused with the thoughts of the King of Spain's being its Catholick
Monarch, and of having tormented it self with Jealousies about such a great
Nothing: And which I believe was never modell'd in the fancy of that
Prince, and was only projected by Court-Sycophants, and Mercenary Writers;
and that he himself never enter'd any express claim to it, one would think
who reads the Duke of Buckingham's answer to the Spanish Embassador's In|formations,
c. Anno 1624. where the Duke having aggravated some
State-Practices, the Spanish Minister adds, And is not this a Proclamation
to all the World, that they aspired to such an absolute Monarchy as so many
Books, Stories, Discourses, and the general Complaints of all Princes and
States have long charged them with?
But for such Writers as I last mention'd to flatter a Prince with Insinua|tions
of the Greatness and Extent of his Power, is not more unusual then for
Mendicant Poets to over-act their part in Panegyricks, or for the Celebra|tors
of any particular bright beauty in Verse, to represent her as the Em|press
of all Hearts: and thus the Famous Campanella after he had made his
Present of the Universal Monarchy to Spain, sent it too a Begging into
France, as appears out of Arch-Bishop Laud's Book against Fisher, pag. 210.
where he saith that lately Friar Companella hath set out an Eclogue on the
Birth of the Dauphin, and that permissu Superiorum, in which he saith, that
all the Princes are now more affraid of France then ever, for that there is pro|vided
for it, Regnum Universale, the Vniversal Kingdom or Monarchy. The
words there are in the Margin, Quum Gallia alat 20000000 hominum, ex
Singulis Centenis sumendo unum collegit 200000 strenuorum militum stipen|diatorum
commode perpetuoque, propterea omnes terrae Principes metuunt nunc
magis a Gallia quam unquam ab aliis. Paratur enim illi Regnum Vniversale.
F. Thoae Companellae ecloga in Principis Galliarum Delphini Nativitatem;
cum annot. discip. Parisiis 1639. Cum permissu Superiorum.
Yet with a Non obstante to the Politicks of Campanella, and his pittyful
great Flatteries, I shall venture to pronounce the Great French Monarch,
who is certainly as great a Prince in the Intellectual World, as in the other,
and is truly by the bright Sun of Reason non pluribus impar, no Designer of
taking the Dimensions of the whole Globe of the Earth with Chains; and

do think the most Christian King, out of his Royal Prudence, less inclined
to favour the servile Flatterers, who would set him up to be King of Chri|stendom,
then was formerly the Catholick Monarch to encourage those who
render'd him aspiring to be the Vniversal one: a Title which according to
the excellent saying of Mr. Cowly in his Brutus, None can deserve, but he who
would refuse the offer.
Nor do I doubt but that if ever the greatest Prince in Christendom should
be abandoned to the Vanity of attempting the particular Conquest of Great
Britain and Ireland, his Power in the Ballance of the VVorld would as
soon and as sensibly grow insignificant thereby, as did the King of Spains',
by the Design of 88. And as the Fate of the great temporary Disturbers of
Mankind hath been their constant Augmentation of their own Expences,
(which was a just pecuniary mulct from Heaven on their Ambition for
their encrease of the charge of divers Nations in the posture of Defence,)
so is it likely to be more and more to the end of Time: And it was suffici|ently
exemplified in the Result of the Pope's and King of Spain's Politicks in
88, which reduced them to attempt the Remedying of the Prosuion of
their Treasure by sending (as I may say) Canonical Waste-Paper to the
West-Indies, and the loss too of their Cargo of that, as appears by Malynes
in his Lex Mercatoria, where he saith, pag. 126. That in the year 1561,
Pope Sixtus Quintus caused two Ships to be Laden out of Spain for the West-Indies
with a 100. Buts of Sack, 1400 little Chests containing each of them
three ordinary small Barrels of Quick-Silver, weighing 50 l. apiece, to refine the
Silver withal in the VVest-Indies; and a great number of Packs of Printed
Bulls, and Pardons granted at that time to make Provision against Hereticks,
because the year 1588, had so much exhausted the Treasure of Spain. These
two Ships were met with at Sea by Captain VVhite (who was Laden and
Bound for Barbary) and brought into England by him, where the Commodi|ties
were Sold: But the Popes Merchandise being out of request, and remain|ing
a long time in Ware-Houses at the disposal of Queen Elizabeth, at the last
at the request of her Physician Doctor Lopez, she gave all that great quantity
of Bulls to him, amounting to many thousands in number: And he and another
sent those Bulls into the VVest-Indies, where they were no sooner Arrived but
the Popes Contractors for that Commodity did Seise on all the said Bulls, and
caus'd an Information to be given against them, that they were Infected, as
having been taken by Hereticks. Twas alledged that they were Miraculously
saved; but they were lost and Confiscated. Malynes further mentions, That
he was employed to appraise the Lading of those Prizes, and to certifie what it
cost, and what it might have been worth in the VVest-Indies according to the
rate of every Bull tax'd at two Rials of Plate, and some four, and some eight
Rials, according to their Limitation, every one being but one sheet of Paper,
and by Computation the Lading did not cost 50000 l. and would have yielded
above 600000 l. He had before said, That every Reasonable Soul of the Popish
Religion in America must have one of these Bulls yearly; and that these Bulls
contained a Mandate, that their Beds should be sold who would not take off one
of them.
It seems (by the way) that all that Treasure of Indulgences, bestowed by
Queen Elizabeth on Doctor Lopez, could not oblige him from designing
afterward to take away her Life by Poyson. But this was the result of
the Trage-Comedy, or rather, Farce of 88. and Broyl on the Coast when
Spains Invincible Fleet that had in it but 8350. Seamen, proved the sport
of Fortune and of the VVinds, and the fatal VVrack of its Treasure, inso|much
that it could never since (if then) aw the world by the Number of
Mariners; Men who love not to be paid with Tickets even in this VVorld,

and much less to receive them as payable in another, the which is the true
Notion of Paper-Indulgences.
It is agreed on by all Writers, that the Spanish Armada, consisting of 130
Ships then had in it but the Number of Seamen before-mention'd (and of
those too a great part borrowed from diverse Countries) and 19290 Land
Soldiers, which Naturally clogg'd its Sea Service; for the Antipathy be|tween
those and Seamen in Ships is such, that unless the Seamen are the
Major part there, they are apt to look on those as intruders, and as such
who stand in their way, and in their light: But in a Remonstrance to the
Earl of Nottingham, Lord High Admiral, from the Trinity House, Anno
1602. Extant in Sir Iulius Caesar's Collections, 'tis mention'd, that in 88.
The Queen had at Sea 150. Sail of Ships, whereof 40 only were her own, and
110 were of her Subjects, and that in the same year there were English Ships
employed in Trading Voyages into all Parts and Countries, to the Number like|wise
of 150 Sail, of about 150 Tunn one with another, and that all those 300
Ships were Manned with 30000 Seamen, that is, the Queens Forty with
12000, and the 110, with 12000, and that in the other 150, were 6000
Seamen.
But it is not unworthy to be remark'd, that notwithstanding the Con|currence
of Providence with the Gallantry and Numbers of her Seamen, and
the great event of the Confusion of the Armada, that made the VVorld so
willingly Tributary to her praise; She was so far from giving it any um|brage
of her claiming any Vniversal Empire of the Sea, that she as semper
eadem, who some years before 88. (as we have it in Cambden) had on the
Spanish Embassador's Complaining that the Indian Ocean was Sail'd by the
English, Reply'd, That no Title to the Ocean belongs to any People or particu|lar
Man, for as much as neither Nature, nor regard of Publick Vse permits the
Possession thereof: Did likewise after 88 Notifie the same thing by her Em|bassador's
Expostulation with the King of Denmark, and that the Sea is free
for all Men, and that Princes have no such Dominion of the Sea, that they can
deny Sailers the use thereof, no more then of the Ayre, according to that saying
of the Emperor Antonine, I am Lord of the Earth, but the Law is Lord of the
Sea; and she urged, That Princes have no Iurisdiction of the Sea, but of that
which is near adjacent to their Territories, and that only for the securing the
Navigation from Pirates and Enemies: and that the Kings of England never
prohibited the Navigation and Fishing on the Irish Sea, that is between Ire|land
and England, tho they are Lords of the Coast on both sides; No less then
the Dane is of Norway and Izeland, who challengeth this Right to him on no
other account.
I intend not to awaken any Controversie about this matter that is asleep
in the VVorld, and if it were not, do suppose that Loccenius's distinction in his
De Iure Maritimo, namely the Imperium Maris Vniversale,  Particulare,
and ancient usages, and the Pacta Conventa of Princes and States might send it
to rest. I have only spoke of the Fact of the Point in Queen Elizabeths Story,
who probably foresaw that her great example of advancing Navigation,
would oblige the VVorld to follow it, and that the claiming an Vniversal
Empire of the Shoar, would not have sounded harsher then the pretending
to such an one of the Sea, an Empire as easily drawn in a Poets Imagination,
as a Ship usually in a Geographer's Map, and with the like proportion; since
if the Ship were Measured by his Scale of Miles, it would appear perhaps
two or three hundred miles long.
Thus the samed Venetian Poet Sannazarius long since in an Epigram of
six Verses, that begins with Viderat Adriacis, c. put the Complement of
the whole Empire of the Sea on the City of Venice, and was rewarded by

the Senate with about a 100 of our Nobles for every Verse; but they knew
better things then to espouse more of the Sea, then their own Adriatick, and
of that too a Pope once demanding the Original of their Right: they re|turned
him an answer very like Poetry, That their Charter for it, was en|rolled
on the back of Constantine's Donation, of which the Record was in his
Custody: They knew that the enclosing the Common of the whole Sea
would have been too chargeable an Adventure, and that the Dominion of
their Adriatick was no sine cure, but brought its Load of Obligation with
it, and particularly to protect their Subjects and Allies there, and to purge
it from Pirates, and punish Delinquents therein.
Nor could it be a remote Consideration to our Queen and her whole
Council, that the securing her particular Interest, even in the Brittish Seas,
was liable to difficulty and uncertainty, in regard of the uncertain humor
of the Seamen her Subjects, and of the aptness of all Marriners to change
their Quarters, and Embarque in Forraign Service, sometimes on a Capricio
of their reputing themselves disobliged at home, and at other times on their
expectance of better Pay abroad: And accordingly the said Remonstrance
from Trinity-House sets forth, That in a little above 12. years after 88. the
Shiping and Number of our Seamen were decay'd about a 3d. part.
But tho the World has no Universal Empire, yet Seamen by the move|able
Scenes of their Lise, and their being every where useful and welcome,
have the Previledge of being Universal Subjects, and are easily tempted to
seek good Entertainment in other Countreys, if they find it not in their own.
What I have before observed concerning the Influence of Numbers on
the Government of the VVorld, will make it appear to any man of ordina|ry
thought and sense, that the Science of the encrease of the People is not
a nice Speculation, or an expedient in knowledge to salve Phaenomena,
but is indeed of much more use to the Body Politick, then the discovery
of the Circulation of the Bloud is to the Body Natural: And I may add,
That men's now gravely proceeding just in those tracks of Policy, that they
have read and took notes of out of the Classick Authors, who writ when
there were not so many Millions of Readers and Observers in the World as
are now, would be as absurd as is Astrologers, taking the measures of their
Predictions now from the Tables of Ptolomy, since whose time the Equino|ctials
and the whole Systeme of Heaven are moved from the Position they
then had among the fix'd Stars, a whole Sign or more, and as is some A|stronomers
pertinacy in following the error of Aristotle, who asserted the
unalterableness of the Heavens, because in so many Ages nothing had been
observed to be altered, when the many Experiences of new Stars have since
confuted the Reason that moved Aristotle to thing as he did.
Princes and States will now in the Administration of Publick Affairs find
themselves obliged to mend their pace, and no longer travel so unconcern'd
through the World as formerly, while now they see the new tides of Gene|ration
coming in so fast: And no doubt but the great example of the French
Monarch, and his admirable exact proportioning of his Receits with his
Expences (the which was so remarkable in that active and expenceful year
of 1673. that then his Receipts came to 8,232,709 l. Sterling, and his Ex|pences
exceeded that total but by 25548 l. Sterling) and the strong Current
of his successes will enforce Political Arithmetick on the World, as the over|flowing
of Nile did Geometry.
And it will be but Natural for us to Conclude, that the great encrease
of the Number of the People here and abroad in the World, must of necessi|ty
be Fatal to the Papacy which has been so long as importunate Candidate
for a fifth Monarchy of the World: But 'tis now too late for any one Man to

be a precarious King of Kings, and particularly to think, that after the ne|cessity
and populousness of the Northern Principalities has made them re|sume
their former Donations of Land to the Bishop of Rome's Hierarchy,
that those Countries that before broke the old Roman Yoke by force, will
now when better peopled, and stock'd with better brains, be again brought
under a New Roman one by fraud, and that the omne Malum ab Aquilone will
not be able in that Quarter to put an end to that which begins in Nomine
Domini, and that they will not be the rather willing so to do, in regard
that the North made the World feel the Malignity of both those Proverbs
by its old well-meant charity to the Bishops of Rome.
And since in the days of Popery here in Harry the 8th's time it did pass
in Rem Iudicatam, that the Pope had no more power over us by the Scripture
then any other forrain Bishop; it cannot now but seem ridiculous to scruple
whether he can thence claim more authority here than any other forrain
Prince; and he who was exploded here formerly when the Critical Specta|tors
were not so many, for having ill acted the part of a King on our stage
of the World, would be thought mad for personating one after the Play is
over.
Thus too in a less people World Bartolus the famous Lawyer pronoun|ced
it to be Haeresie to deny the German Emperor to be King of the Vni|verse,
the which any one would now account Madness to affirm.
And if in France hundreds of Years ago its Monarch greeted the Pope with
the terms of fatuus  amens, for claiming a Supremacy in Temporals there,
'tis impossible he can be otherwise thought there now, prosecuting a claim
to Supremacy in things Ecclesiastic; for even his pretensions to that the
Clergy of France have damned in their Declaration, by setting a General
Council above him: and which Declaration the great Monarch hath there
ratify'd by a perpetual and irrevocable Edict. And 'tis but with a Consonan|cy
to the nature of things, that the Papal Infallibility should be concluded
against in that Declaration: and since as the Author of the Policy of the
Clergy of France relates, the Roman Catholick Church there doth so much
swarm with New Phil sophers there call'd Cartesians and Gassendists, whose
new Philosophy has been there by Zealous Catholics observ'd to have ruin'd
the mystery of the Real Presence, (for so the words are in that Book) 'tis no
wonder if the growth of the Messieurs les scavants encreasing with the Po|pulacy
of that Realm, makes any man's belief of his infallibility pass for a
degree of madness, accordingly as Mr. Hobbes, Chap. 8. Of Man, well ob|serves,
that excessive opinion of a man's own self, for Divine Inspiration and
Wisdome, becomes distraction and giddiness: and this probably may be the
final result there of the late fermentation about the Regalia, c. and the
Pope be tacitly thought so as aforesaid, and his Power there insensibly eva|porate,
and without any visible distrubance given to it by the ratio ultima
Regum: for no prudent person would declaim reproachfully against any of
a quiet Phrensy, or molest and vex such a one tho living near him and
would much less project the disgrace or mischief of such an one living at a
great distance, tho he should assume to himself bigger Titles than ever the
Kings of India or Persia did, and call himself Son of the Sun, or Lord of
the Sea and Land; or like some of the Roman Emperors, challenge Divinity,
or be styled Dominus Deus noster Papa. And thus may the Pope quietly
go on longer to call himself Monarch of the World, without being call'd
Names for it in France, just as the Dukes of Savoy style themselves Kings
of Cyprus without any gainsaying from the Turk; who likewise did not me|nace
the Pope for causing the Brother of the Vice-Roy of Naples to be in
Rome proclaim'd King of Ierusalem: nor when that Gentleman in Requital

of that favour from his Holiness, caused the Pope to be in Naples proclaim|ed
Caliph of Bandas, was the Mogul aggrieved thereby.
And thus probably too will the Enthusiast's who assert a Millennium or
Universal Reign of Christ on earth, with that quietness and gentleness that
the ancient Fathers before the first Nicene Council did, pass off the Stage
of the World; but it will seem ridiculous not to bind such Fifth Monarchy
Men in Chains as Mad-men, who have in England and Germany endeavoured
to bid Kings so, and Nobles with Fetters of Iron, and who would again
make Convulsions in the State, by the Diseases of their minds, as once
Mahomet's Epileptic Fits shook the World, and who by promising us a new
Heaven and a new Earth would confound the old, and only give us a new
Hell broke loose. But the World will not now be blunder'd into Confusion
by such wild Reformers.
In the Book of the Apocalypse (of which Bodin tells us in his Methodus
ad facilem Historiarum Cognitionem, that Calvin's Opinion being ask'd, he
answer'd, Se penits ignorare quid velit tam obscurus scriptor) it must be
confessed that the Majesty of the Style is agreeable to that of the rest of the
holy Text, and that the predictions of the future State of the Church, and
of its splendor in the World are not grosso modo utter'd, or attended with
any irregularity, but on the contrary that God appears there as the God of
Order, and applying all the exactness of proportion and number, and its
very fractions to the great things foretold. After one Verse hath account|ed
the number of the Beast to be 666, the next mentions St. Iohn's Vision of
a Lamb standing on Mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thou|sand.
The Bodies of the Witnesses are mentioned to be unburied three days
and an half. The 4 Angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour, and a
day, and a Month and a Year for to say the third part of Men. The Woman
was to be in the Wilderness 1260 days, and to be nourished there for a time,
and times, and half a time. Blood came out of the Wine-Press by the space of
1600 Furlongs. There were Seal'd of all the Tribes of Israel 144000.
And in the State of Babylon mentioned in Cap. 18th, where the voice
from Heaven is heard, Come out of her my People, though all the various
Sects of Religion that thrust one another into Babylon, will admit of no pro|portion
in their revenge, yet it is there say'd, Reward her even as she rewarded
you, and double unto her double, according to her works, in the Cup which she
hath filled, fill to her double.
But near the end of that Book, where the great Scene of The New Hea|ven
and the New Earth opens, and the Vision of the New Ierusalem is de|scribed,
a Golden Rod was given the Angel to measure the City, and the
Measures thereof are particularized.
And tho I pretend not to understand the meaning of any of these ob|scure
passages of Scripture, yet one thing seems to me there as Conspicu|ous
as the Meridian Light, namely, That as the Divine Providence did
found the Old World in Number, Weight and Measure, so it likewise will
the foretold New One.
The exactness of the Numbers described by St. Iohn in that Prophetick
Book written in the Island of Pathmos, hath assured us that his imagina|tion
was much above the Vapors that fumed into Mens heads in several
Islands anciently, and made them Prophetically Fanatick, as Gryphiander
de Insulis mentions, and in his Chapter there, De Mirabilibus Insularum,
saith, Alibi fatidici specus sunt, quorum exhalatione temulenti futura praeci|nunt,
ut Delphis nobilissimo oraculo. Homines eo Spiritu Correpti dementes
ac fanatici dicti, quod circum fana bacchentur.

But it is confessedly too true, That some of the Expositors of this Book,
and particularly in this our Island did too long here Bacchari circum Fana,
and have therefore justly had the name of Fanaticks, and may as justly
expect that their Oracles should be silenced as the Delphic was, and that a|ny
persons of a sober Party drunk with Enthusiasme will not be again allow|ed
to make all things reel into Confusion.
Those likewise who did here more cum ratione insanire then the Fifth Mo|narchy-men,
I mean the Assertors of Presbytery, and who by the pretence
of putting the Scepter into Christ's hand, projected to put it into their own,
will find the numbers of knowing men now so encreased that our World
will be more averse then formerly against their offers to mend it by their
assuming of Regal Power.
What well willers they were to the Mathematicks of stretching out on
our Church and State, the Line of Confusion, as the Scripture-expression is,
and how they thought Confusion as commendable a thing, as I men|tion'd
Antony's thinking Sedition, sufficiently appears out of Mr. Nyes
Book I quoted before, where the great Architectonical Rule for settling a
Government in the Church is rendred to be the destroying its Government
by Law Establish'd: and he there names it, viz. Tollatur lex  fiat certa|men:
and thereupon he saith, p. 187. It was moved by some Parliament men
Friends to Episcopacy when it was to be removed, that it might remain till a
better Government were concluded; but on the other hand it was prudently con|sidered
how while that form stood and had the advantage of the Law, there
would be no freedom in arguing about it.
But I account that the great Fundamental Principle for the quiet of the
World, as well as of a mans own Conscience, is contrary to that of tollatur
lex, viz. that no man is warranted by any intention of advancing Religion to in|vade
the right of the Sovereign Power, that is inherent in Princes, by the Mu|nicipal
Laws of their Countries. When ever any man quits this Principle,
he hath made his first step from a Precipice: he is fallen from the Pinacle
of the Temple, and has very presumptuously tempted Omnipotence to save
him, after he hath thus begun to destroy himself, and Religion too, and
has to Heavens secret Will sacrificed its Reveal'd.
The shaking of this Principle is, as I may say, the shaking of the
Earth; and as Aulus Gellius tells us in his Noctes Atticae that the Romans
did not know to which of all their Gods to offer Sacrifice in the time of an
Earthquake, but did then only worship an unknown Deity, this too will be
the fate of Nations where the lex terrae is shook by Enthusiasts, namely
that too many people will not know what God to adore, and their pre|tended
Illuminations will only serve to conduct them to such an Altar, as
at Athens ground under the Subscription to the unknown God, and if perhaps
some Enthusiastick weak Brethren arrive not at the denomination of the
Forts-sprits applyed in France to Atheists, they will be abandon'd to a
disposition to close with the next Hypothesis of Religion they shall meet,
whether that of Deists, Papists, or Muggletonians, or Mahumetans; as
Bodin speaking of the Cause of several Nations, being fixt in their particular
soiles saith, alii longo errore jactati, non judicio elegerunt locum, sed lassitudine
proximum occupaverunt.
To this purpose our incomparable Bishop Sanderson in his Lecture de ad|quat
Conscientiae Regul doth with great weight and a profound pious pas|sion,
reflect on the effects of the breaking the Establish'd Religion in Eng|land
by our late Reformers, and saith, Stetit hic aliquamdiu, sed non diu
stetit effraenis hominum temeritas, c. hoc fonte derivata audacia, effluxit
tandem in apertam Rabiem,  exivit jamdiu in furorem Anabaptiscum: 

quamvis quo porr progrediatur vix habet, usque tamen progreditur indies, 
nova quotidie parturit opinionum monstra: ut nisi ex sacrosancto Dei verbo di|dicissemus
firmum stare fundamentum Dei, neque adversus ecclesiam Christi
praevalituras unquam ex toto Inferorum portas, omnino metuendum foret ne
Vniversa Christi ecclesia Atheismi velut diluvio obruta, toto orbe fundits pe|riret.
Little did many of our deluded Reformers when they broke the hedge of
the Law, think what Serpent bit them, and as little did many of their well|meaning
followers think, that while their Pastors did speak the Cause of Re|ligion
so fair, that at that time the very poyson of the aspes of Popery and
Superstition, was under their tongues, for that No Principle hath in it more
of the Popishness of Popery, if I may so say, in the resemblance of the aggra|vation
of Sin by it self, viz. the sinfulness of Sin, then the legitimation of
unjust things by holy ends; and this too our last mention'd Bishop brands
in his Praelectio secunda De bon intentione, where having mention'd that a
Cardinal telling the Pope in a Conclave, that somewhat he propounded to
be done was not just, and that the Pope reply'd, Licet non posset fieri per
viam justitiae, oportere tamen fieri per viam expedientiae, he goes on thus,
Nimirum is thoc est sapere! haec est ex Iesuitarum ni fallor officinis deprompta
Theologia, omnia metiri ex Commodo Sanctae Matris Ecclesiae, sacrosancta
dei eloquia qua lubet inflectere, Nasi ad instar Cerei torquere, distorquere, in|vita
Cogere in rem suam.
And too little do many who justly Complain of Popery's having sup|ported
it self by Arbitrary Power on Earth, reflect on their having sup|ported
that Power against Earth, and even against Heaven it self, and that
the fumes of their Enthusiasme do vainly try to erect a Pillar of smoke
against Heaven, as I spake before of the Iesuites Morals, setting up one of
Ignominy against it, and that it is an unlucky part of the Arbitrariness of
Popery to transplant some of its odious Principles among other Sects, as the
Devil can at pleasure transform himself into an Angel of light.
The general received notion of Superstition is, that 'tis a needless fear
about Religion, and there is no fear more needless and irrational than that
of Gods being unconcern'd in its Protection; the which to imagine, is more
unworthy of the Deity, and a greater tendency to Atheism, then was the
delirium of Epicurus about God's Carelesness of humane affairs; and in rela|tion
to which, Tully in his De Natura Deorum having discours'd of one that
deny'd the being of a Deity, saith, Nec san multum interest urum id neget,
an Deos omni procuratione at actione privet: mihi enim qui nihil agit, esse
omnino non videtur.
He there moreover acquaints us with the origine of the word Superstition,
saying, that Non enim Philosophi, verm etiam Majores nostri superstitionem
 Religione separaverunt: nam qui totos Dies precabantur,  immolabant ut
sui liberi sibi superstites essent, superstitiosi sunt appellati, quod nomen patuit
posle latis; qui autem omnia quae ad Deorum Cultum pertinerent, diligenter
pertractarent,  tanquam relegerent, sunt dicti Religiosi ex religendo, c.
But those things that those antient Heathens carefully discriminated, many
Modern Christians as carefully Confound, namely Superstition and Religion,
and by the innate pride of Humane Nature leading men to worship the
Gods that they make, rather then the God that made them, and which en|slaved
the ancient Jews almost with a Continuando to the Adoration of
stocks and stones, and to the neglect of the worshiping the God that deli|vered
them from the House of Bondage; degenerate Christians adore the
Births of Religion in their own fancies, and having there Model'd a Deity
do Act over the old Superstition with Anxious wishes and Formal Prayers

that those their monstrous Births may out-live them, and do outgo all ex|amples
of the heathen World in the , immolating Nations by
War to those Children of their imagination; and thus Popish Superstition
within our Memory turn'd Ireland into one Akeldama, and Enthusiastick
Superstition converted England into another; and as Lipsius tells us, that
the gladiatory Combats did in some one Month cost Europe 30000 mens
lifes to divert the old Romans, so fanatical have some that call themselves
Protestants been as to afford sport and diversion to the new Romanists, and
even the very Iesuits by Superstition, having made so many of us Gladia|tors
against one another, and as if we were Brute Animals, we give them
the recreation of seeing us like Cocks attacking each other with the keen|est
anger when they please, and give the Arbitrary Power to the Iesuits
to make our Land their Cock-Pit.
But the set time (humanly speaking) for the extermination of the su|perstition
of Popery here being come, and the worst thing in Popery be|ing
its Fanaticism, and Holy Church being the great Asylum of that, as our
Learned Dr. Stilling fleet hath taught the World in his Book of the Fana|ticism
of the Church of Rome, 'tis in vain for Popery or Jesutisme to save-themselves
from the blow of Fate by standing behind Presbytery. The
Conclusum est contra Manichaeos before mention'd that is now the Vox populi,
doth with its full cry pursue Presbytery as well as Popery, for the making
duo summa Principia in States and Kingdoms, and claiming an Ecclesiastick
Power immediately derived from Christ and not dependant on the Civil:
and 'tis in vain for any Principle, that an awaken'd World pursues as a
Cheat to try to save it self by changing its name. There is no observation
more common, then that Popery and Presbytery that seem as distant as the
two Poles, yet move on the same Axle-tree of a Church Supremacy immedi|ately
derived from Christ; and Mr. Hobbs his Leviathan might have passed
through the World with a general Applause, if no Notion had been worse in
it then in Chap. 44. The making his Kingdom of darkness to consist of Po|pery
and Presbytery.
The measures that the Genius of our Nation inclines it to take of things
from experiment, will Naturally Perpetuate its aversion from Presbytery as
well as Popery.
For tho the Divines of the Protestant Churches abroad that are fautors
of the Presbyterian Form of Church Government, own not the doctrine
of Rebelling for Religion, and tho thus on the occasion of a Iesuite's for|merly
Printing somewhat in defence of his Order, and alledging that seve|ral
Protestant Writers had allow'd the Rebelling of Subjects against their
Princes, and instanceth in Buchanan and Knox, yet Rivet the Professor of
Divinity at Leiden, in his Answer to that Jesuite, saith, that all other Pro|testant
Writers Condemn that doctrine; and he ascribes the Rashness of Bu|chanan
and Knox, praefervido Scotorum ingenio,  ad audendum prompto:
and tho the persons who in Holland and France live under that Form of
Church Government, have pretended to no authority from Christ to resist
Soveraign Powers, and that the Loyalty of the French Protestants hath been
so signal under all their Pressures that D'Ossat in his Letter to Villeroy from
Rome, Ianuary the 25th, 1595, having discoursed of the horrid attempt
against the Life of Harry the 4th, acknowledgeth, Concerning the Hugo|nots,
il's n'ont rien attent de tel, ny contre lui, ny contre aucun de cinq Roys
ses predecesseurs, quelque boucherie que leurs Majestez ayent faite des dits
Huguenots: i. e. They have attempted nothing of this Kind either against
him or against any of the five Kings his Predecessors, notwithstanding the
butchery or slaughter that their Majesties made of those Huguenots, yet is

it too notorious to be denyed that that sort of Church-Government having
in Scotland in the time of our former Princes been accustomed continual|ly
to hold their Noses to Grind-stones, which was a preparatory way to
have brought their Heads to Blocks, and that Nation invading us with a
Covenant, the very entring into which and the imposing it without leave
from the King so to do, and much more against his Command, was a
thing that perhaps to the Associators themselves seemed illegal and contrary
to the Petition of Right, which provides against the administring of any Oath
not warrantable by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, there was by that
means a Coalition between the Presbyterian Divines of our Nation and
theirs in principles of Enthusiasme and Rebellion Principles that our Noncon|formist
Divines in King Iames's time here abhorr'd; for in the
Protestation of the Kings Supremacy made by those Ministers and
Published Anno 1605, the conclusion of their 4th Tenet is, That the Su|premacy
of Kings is not tyed to their Faith and Christianity, but to their
very Crown from which no Subject or Subjects have power to separate or dis|joyn
it: and their 9th Tenet is, We hold that though the King should command
any thing contrary to the Word unto the Churches, that yet they ought not to
resist him therein, but only peaceably to forbear Obedience and sue to him for
Grace and Mercy, and where that cannot be had meekly to submit themselves
to the Punishment: and their last Tenet is, We hold it utterly unlawful for
any Christian Churches whatsoever by any Armed Force or Power against the
will of the Civil Magistrate and State under which they live, to erect and
set up in publick the true worship of God, or to beat down or suppress any Su|perstition
and Idolatry that shall be countenanced and maintained by the same.
And I believe none will imagine that those Nonconforming Divines
would take any Oath but in the imposers sence, or Casuistically advise others
so to do.
'Tis therefore no marvel if our later Presbytery being so unconformable
to the Law of the Land, and to the Tenets of the former Nonconformists,
soon grew weary of it self, and did with its horrid Visage only face us and
march off. Your Lordship found that in another thing it resembled Pope|ry,
namely in that it would be all or nothing, and you helped it to the lat|ter
part of the Alternative.
Mr. Nye who made a great Figure in the Assembly of Divines, hath in
that Book of his forementioned, p. 98, helped this Age to know how Ar|bitrary
they would have been in delivering men to Satan; for saith he
there the exercise of Discipline in our Congregations was ordered by the Par|liament,
but limited likewise to an enumeration of the Sins for which we might
excommunicate, exempting other Sinners that were as much under our charge.
This was looked on by the Assembly as a great Abridgment of their Ministeri|al
Liberty, and so great as they professed it could not with a good Conscience
be submitted to, as not being able to perform their trust which they receiv'd
from Iesus Christ, and must give an account of to him, resolving to stand fast
in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made them free.
So ridiculous were those Divines that tho no Pope ever arrogated a power
to Excommunicate one, but for the Crimes nominated in his Canon-Law, and
tho our Church of England never claim'd a power of excommunicating,
but for a Crime express'd in the Kings Ecclesiastical Laws, yet those frow|ard
Disciplinarians would have been allow'd to shoot their Thunderbolts of
Excommunication upon a Capricio. But not only the Parliament but the
whole Nation in a manner pronounced them Contumacious: the people saw
how Arbitrarily they would have interdicted the whole Land from the use
of the Cup and Bread too in the Sacrament, and have rail'd in the Com|munion-Table

with fantastick Qualifications, and they soon judged those
Clergy-men guilty of Irregularity, and the rather for that they had en|gaged
so far in Caus sanguinis, and the same Sun of Reason and Knowledge
that with the strength of its Beams had here put out the Popes Kitching Fire
of Purgatory, did soon without noise and insensibly confound their Domi|nions
in the Kingdom of Darkness, and those Divines themselves found that
their destroying Episcopacy here, had in effect by the Parliaments being
their Superintendants, enthroned Erastianisme, that which indeed their
Principles led them to hate more then Episcopacy it self.
Mr. Baxter in the Preface to his second part of the Nonconformists Plea
speaking of Presbytery saith, I do not hear of many out of London and
Lancashire that did ever set up this Government, and I know not of one Con|gregation
now in London of Englishmen that exerciseth the Presbyterian Go|vernment,
nor ever did since the King came home, c. And saith, they have
no National Assembly, no Classes, no Coalition of many Churches to make a
Presbytery, and I hear of none (unless perhaps some Independants that I know
not) that have so much as ruling Lay-Elders.
Alluding to some expressions before applyed to Papists and Popery, I may
say that the Cato's of Presbytery came here on the Stage, tantum ut exirent,
and that Government soon had its period here per simplicem desinentiam:
'Twas obvious that Presbytery as well as Popery directed men where to
stand in a place divided from the Civil Government, and so to shake the
Earth: and it appear'd very inauspicious to the Model of the Covenant, that
in its first Paragraph, it should stumble upon implicit Faith, by swearing to
a Government and Reformation that shall be, and to the preservation of the
Reformed Religion in the Church of Scotland, in Doctrine, Worship, Disci|pline
and Government, the particulars whereof, the Lay-Covenanters of
England, if not the Clerical also were far from understanding.
And tho in that Paragraph the Covenant binds its takers to endeavour to
advance the Reformation of Religion according to the word of God (a Clause
that Sir Harry Vane declared to a very worthy Gentleman now living, that he
caus'd to be inserted into the Covenant after much debate about the same,
and opposition from the Scotch Commissioners with whom he was interested
in the making of it, and thereupon said, That e was three days in getting
the word of God into the Covenant) yet that Covenant having almost extir|pated
Root and Branch, those spiritual Guides from whom the people might
expect a more Rational and Learned Interpretation of the Sense of the word
of God, then from the Presbyterian Divines, they were soon sensible of
their danger both as to the perverting of the Scripture and subverting of the
Church from the new Correctors of Magnificat, and found that such an
Inundation of Vile Religionary Tenets was got into the Church, that the
Houses of Parliament ordered the 10th of March, 1646. To be set apart as
a solemn day of humiliation to seek Gods Assistance for the suppressing
and preventing of the growth and spreading of Errors, Heresies and Blasphe|mies,
and that Mr. Vines on that day Preaching before the Commons, p. the
4th of his Sermon printed, acknowledged, That that day was the first
that ever was in England on that sad occasion, and p. 67 of that Sermon
mentioned a most detestable thing then broach'd by the Press, though yet
in the way of Query, namely, what is meant by the word Scripture when
it is asserted that the denying of the Scriptures to be the word of God should be
holden worthy of death: for saith the Author, either the English Scriptures
or Scriptures in English are meant by the word Scriptures, or the Hebrew and
Greek Copies or Originals, the former cannot be meant with reason, because
God did not speak to his Prophets and Apostles in the English Tongue: nor

the latter, for the greatest part of men in the Kingdom do not understand or know
them.
Mr. Vines declared his just Abhorrence of that insinuation, and saith, If
this dilemma be good, what is become of the certain foundation of our hope, or
faith, or comfort? how can we search the Scriptures without going first to
School to learn Hebrew, and Greek? And 'twas obvious to every one to
consider that if the English Scriptures are not the word of God, there
was an end, not only of the Reformation according to it mentioned in the
Covenant, but the substantial one promoted by the Protestant Religion, that
help'd us to the Treasure of our English Bibles, and that we should soon
be stranded on the Shore of Implicit Faith.
Nor could it long be hid from common observation, that those Divines
who exclaim'd so much against the Ceremonies of the Church of England;
as an oppressive Yoke, would have imposed on us such a rigid observa|tion
of the Sabbath, the great Scene of Ceremonies among the Iews, as
would have made it forgot that it was ever made for man.
The thinking sort of men found that tho the Principles of those Divines
did not like the Jesuits make Calumny no mortal Sin, that yet as the Ad|herents
to Presbytery did calumniate the Constitution of the Church of
England for bordring on Popery, and the Royal Martyr for being a Fautor
to it, so they did by their Censorious tempers transfuse such an acid hu|mour
among the people, that very much loosned the Nerves of the English
good nature, and distorted the English hospitality, and therefore 'tis but by
a natural instinct that that old Pharisaical Leven is now so nauseous, that
probably any one suspected of an inclination to replant the old Presbytery
here and its Arbitrary Power to excommunicate, would too be staked down
to a narrower tedder in Conversation, and be it as it were excommunicated
from Gentlemens Company, as much as Make-bates, or common Inform|ers
upon Penal Statutes.
The people heretofore found out that as Popery endangers men by the
Priests not intending to make the Sacrament of the Eucharist when he admini|sters
it: So that these, as I said, intended it should not be at all administred
but to their own Sect, and that the gesture of sitting at the Communion
that they invited men to, and thereby to their being rescued from the
Popish Posture of Kneeling, was but a sort of Sham in its way, for that
kneeling, was the gesture used in the ancient times of the Church, and
the first that was ever observ'd to sit then was the Pope to express his
State.
The observing sort of Men then judged that as Sibthorpe and Manwaring
had been exploded for going beyond their Credentials from Heaven, as
God's Ambassadors, in straining the Prerogative of Princes, these deserv'd
to be so too, for scruing the Power of Parliaments above Law, and for
thrusting down the King into the Class of The Three Estates; and that as
Sibthorpe was exposed to severe Animadversions, from the Age for his Ser|mon
of Apostolic Obedience, shewing the Duty of Subjects to pay Tribute and
Taxes to their Princes, c. And p. 21. of that Sermon, applying the
words of Curse ye Meroz, yea curse them bitterly, c. to the promoting
his illegal purpose; they deserved to be censur'd for going on too with the
Alarm of Curse ye Meroz thousands of times over, when the Subjects were
slack in paying Tribute to one another, to dethrone their Prince.
They saw that those Divines in trying to salve the Phaenomena of the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and the Covenant that they had taken,
were in the Course of their Theology continually put to it, to deliberate of
Rebellion, and that their very deliberation of it was ipso facto one, and a

thing that included the horror of a mans deliberating to kill his Father:
and 'twas but natural for the people representative and diffusive to fancy it
lawful for them silently to resume the power given to those Church-men
and abused by them, who were always in the Pulpit and Press lowdly trum|peting
forth the Iesuitical Notion of the lawfulness of the peoples resu|ming
the Power given to Kings; and as I shall never fear that the King of
Spain will ever be able to take the World in a Ginne by Campanellas advise
to him in Chap. 5. of the Spanish Monarchy to employ Divines, to set up the
Roar of unus Pastor and unum Ovile every where for the Pope, so neither
shall I, that mens vociferating the Clause in the Covenant, viz. That the Lord
may be One and his Name One and in the three Kingdoms, will ever again be
able to embroyl them.
In short any one who shall consider that in Scotland Presbytery's former
Kingdom of Darkness, the people have been so of late illuminated as to find the
way to be Latitudinarians, need never have any fears and jealousies of that
Governments, jus Divinum, again Marching hither. In the first Session of the se|cond
Parliament of this King at Edenburgh, November the 16th, 1669.
There passed an Act wherein 'twas declared, That his Majesty hath the Su|preme
Authority over all Persons and in all Causes Ecclesiastical within this
his Kingdom, and that by vertue thereof the ordering and disposal of the exter|nal
Government and Policy of the Church doth properly belong to his Majesty
and his Successors as an Inherent Right to the Crown, and that his Majesty and
his Successors, may settle, Enact and Emit such Constitutions, Acts and Or|ders,
concerning the Administration of the External Government of the Church
and the Persons employed in the same, and concerning all Ecclesiastical meeting,
and matters to be proposed and determined therein as they in their Royal Wisdom
shall think fit, c. And his Majesty with Advise and Consent aforesaid doth
rescind and annual all Laws, Acts and Clauses thereof and all Customs and Con|stitutions
Civil or Ecclesiastick, which are contrary to or inconsistent with his
Majesties Supremacy as it is here asserted, and declares the same void and null
in all times coming.
This Act of Parliament is the more observable for that it declared the
extent of the Regal Power in Ecclesiasticks, after that in the Year 1663,
An Act passed there for a National Synod under the Government of Bishops,
and for that Presbytery which was before like Hame, the only body in Na|ture
that doth not content it self to take in any other body, but would
either overcome and turn another body into it self, as by victory, or it
self to dye and go out, was then grown so amenable to the Course of Na|ture
in all other bodies (of which one is a glue to another) that not satis|fied
with its own former consistence, it did as suddenly, and easily, and
quietly receive in the body of Episcopacy (as I may say) as Air takes in
light, and as readily as Metals themselves receive in strong waters; and then
it was that Episcopacy which in the Forms of Church Government seems by
its weight as Gold among Metals (and indeed all bodies) to be the
most close and solid, did there greedily drink in the Quicksilver of Presby|tery.
But tho Presbytery then was and now is considerable in the Internal part
of the Government of the Church of Scotland, and is likely so to be till
Christ's second coming (humanly speaking) with a non obstante to any thing
that time can cause, and will be preserved in perpetuity by the means of
what my Lord Bacon calls the drowning of Metals, namely when the baser
Metal is incorporated with the more rich as Silver with Gold, yet so wil|ling
were they in Scotland to give to Caesar the real Supremacy that was
Caesars, that knowing the Protestant Religion can be no more there de|stroyed

under any external form of Church Polity then as I said, Gold can
be destroyed in Nature, they thought it more prudent to trust the Crown
with a Power of melting down that on emergent occasions, and altering
the Superscription of its Coin in infinitum, I mean its outward polity and
denominations, rather then that the Crown it self should be once more
so fatally melted down by any of those denominations as formerly.
And as the Covenanting Divines of Scotland by at last consenting that
some things in their Presbytery (which whether tolerabiles ineptiae or sub|stantially
good, I now enquire not) should be preserved by Episcopacy's be|ing
the Paramount National Church Government, have done that which
would make it appear ridiculous for them ever again to attempt to replant
Presbytery and extirpate Prelacy as formerly, so likewise have the most emi|nent
sort of our Presbyterian Divines, who were associated with them, by de|siring
since the King's Restoration to submit to Dr. Vsher the Archbishop of
Armagh's Form of Episcopacy, done the self same thing (over and above their
being then reordained by Bishops who had before received Orders only
from the hands of the Presbytery) and especially when it shall be consi|dered
that that Form of Episcopacy as described by that Learned and Pious
Archbishop Courted them and was refused by them, before our Civil War
began wherein they were the Trumpeters and before three hundred thou|sand
men were slain in England, as Mr. Carew Reynel in his Book called the
true English Interest Accounts the number to have been.
'Tis therefore with the justice of Fate that our old Presbytery too is
gone among Pancirolls Res Deperditae: and if it could be supposed that
there was any Order of Forraigners, whose avowed or known design it
was by force or restless artifices and retaining Pensioners to revive that Go|vernment
here in spight of our Laws, I shall think the term of hostes with
justice applicable to them too.
But there is another thing beside the Coincidence of some of the Princi|ples
of our Presbyterians, with Popery, that we have now too loud a Call
to think of: and that is that the great real part of the danger that we now
are in of the inundation of Popery, and its idolatrous worship, is to be
imputed to their having broke the Banks of the Regal Power, and enforced
the Royal Issue for the Safety of their Persons to be exiles abroad in Popish
Countries for many years, and where they might be in danger of the
Poyson of Popery conveyed into them in the Vehicle of the Civilities they
received from Popish Princes after they had been so barbarously treated by
their Protestant Subjects, who after they had by secret whispers calumniated
them for being Papists here, did in effect by the loud outrage of their Acti|ons
bid them go and be Idolaters there.
When I think of the cruelty in the late Usurpation they shewed to his
Majesty in his being thus not led but driven into temptation by his Subjects,
I am minded of applying to it, part of those words in 1 Samuel c. 26. v.
10. of David to Saul, If the Lord hath stirred thee up against me, let him
accept an Offering, but if they be the Children of Men, cursed be they before
the Lord, for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the Inheri|tance
of the Lord, saying, go serve other Gods: as to the meaning of which
words, I shall consult no Commentators among the Critics but shall rather
take it from the Assemblies Notes, and I may say that in their Comment on
it they write their own Commentaries, and they thus  propos say, I am
now driven so as I cannot be present in the Tabernacle to worship God and enjoy
those holy Priviledges, but am forced to wander from place to place, c. saying,
go serve other Gods, that is, tho not verbally yet really they have done it,
and as much as in them lies, they have compelled me to Idolatry, by forcing
me an Exile to fly into idolatrous Countries, c.

It cannot have escaped the observation of a person so curious as your
Lordship, that among the many allow'd ways of Punishment among the
Iews, banishment was not one, and the reason thereof is supposed among
the Rabbinical writers to be this: the Laws of the Iews and their Religion
being the same thing, to have banished men from their Country and the
benefits of its municipal or Civil Law there, had been to have
banish'd them from their Religion and the means of their salva|tion,
and from doing with the Iews were so averse that even
the Excommunicate among them were not removed from all parts of the
Temple, and were admitted there to a peculiar place. But this cruelty to
Souls unknown even among the stiff-neck'd, hard hearted Iews, was by
such Christians as pretended to the greatest tenderness of Conscience pra|ctised
toward their Soveraign, and that to such a degree that as if they de|signed
that the Lords Annointed the Breath of our Nostrils should be only
in the infectious Air of Popery, after they had exiled him from his own
Protestant Realms, they effected by the power of the prevalent Faction in
Holland, that he and his R. H's and their Adherents should be banish'd
thence also: nay, out of France where the Air was less infected with Popery,
into one more pestilential, I mean into the Dominions of Spain.
If therefore there is any number of men in these Realms that owns the
old Scotch Plat-form or Presbytery, and the former Methods to advance it
here who shall be excessive in aggravating our danger of Popery, I shall
think that herein they practise a great deal of Self-denial, and do not con|sult
their own rest while they disturb that of the World, and are of all men
the most obliged to speak softly of that Subject.
But more then enuf hath been said to argue the paucity of the number
of such in England. The Bishops Survey of the number of the perverse
Opiners in Religion mentions that two or three are called Self-willers pro|fessedly:
and by that number of that Sect (for ought I know) may be
meant so many of the lovers of the old Plat-form, and no name can bet|ter
fit any who would maintain the Garrison of an opinion after their
Commanders have slighted it, then Self-willers.
But so much gratitude doth Popery now shew to Presbytery and to those
who are call'd Presbyterians, that because they magnifie and enlarge the
Numbers of the Papists on all occasions, the Papists do the like for them.
And because 'tis now the mode of many timid Protestants to value them|selves
upon their Timidity's, and on the fear of the Papists and their numbers
being falln upon them, as if Christ who commanded his little Flock not to fear,
could be pleased with his great Flock of Protestants here being in continual
fear of Antichrists little one, I shall now entertain your Lordship with an
Account of the present number of the Papists here, and some little histo|rical
Glanses about the gradual decrease thereof in this Realm in several con|junctures
of time since the Reformation, and in every one of which the
highest tide of their numbers hath been but introductive to their lowest
Ebb.
Of all Nations the English are observ'd to be the least addicted either to
fear or jealousie. The Pencil of Nature hath in English minds on the dull
and vile colour of fear (the which is said to be aversion with the opinion
of hurt from any object) laid on that more noble and bright one, which
is said to be the hope of avoiding that hurt by resistance, and is called
Courage: and this Age which is so inquisitive into the Causes of things,
will be naturally apt to abominate that fear that is causeless, or without
the apprehension of why or what, and which from the Fables of Pan (as
Mr. Hobbs saith) is called Panic-fear: and methinks the very English genius

doth now begin to rouze it self up and call on us to weigh our fear, and
if we find it just to prevent our being surprized by danger, and if causeless,
to abandon it, according to the words of the Orator against Catiline, Si
verus ne opprimar, sin fallus ut tandem aliquando timere desinam, and not to
contribute to the encreasing the numbers of the Papists which has in all
times most fatally happen'd (and that too according to the course of Nature)
by the fearing them, according to the Instance of the encrease of the
number of the Iews mentioned in the Book of Esther, where 'tis said,
And many of the people of the Land became Jews, for the fear of the Jews
fll upon them.
On the account of our having most justly deserved the Visitation of Po|pery
we may very reasonably apprehend the danger of it: but the immo|derate
fear of the Plague is so far from being an Antidote against it that we
use to say, it comes with a fear. And as we have justly deserved to be pu|nished
by the rage of Popery, so have we likewise to be tormented with
those Epidemic fears to which we are abandon'd, a Judgment mention'd by
the Royal Prophet, where he says, Put them in fear O Lord, c. and like|wise
one Concomitant of our fear, namely, the shame we are exposed to for
it from the Papists themselves. An instance of it occurr'd to me in the
Reading a Pamphlet call'd the seasonall Address of the Church of England
to both Houses of Parliament, Printed in the Tear 1677, but writ by a Pa|pist
and in the way of Sarcasme, where in p. 30. the Author saith, And here
I cannot omit to tell you that this partiality of our Rigor hath already given
Protestants the consusion and Papists the comfort to imagine that our fears and
jealousies of Popery which at present disturb and distract the Nation, are but
the self same sprights that haunted Caiphas his house, lay under the Jews
Council-Table, and scared them with the Romans coming and overrunning their
Countrey. There have been men of so weak a judgment that they have dyed only
with the fear of death, and it is not without all ground that our Adversaries
now hope that we shall at length turn Papists with the fear of Popery.
But that I am not heterodox in my Notion of Poperies not being now
so formidable, by the strength of its numbers as the timid Protestants make
it, is sufficiently manifest from the Conditional Vote of two Houses of
Commons relating to the being revenged on the Papists.
Part of the entertainment I just now promised your Lordship, I shall
borrow from Dr. Glanvile, and for it do refer you to his Zealous and
Impartial Protestant, p. 46, 47. where he saith, in the year 1676, Or|ders
came from the Archbishop to the several Bishops, and from them to the re|spective
Ministers and Church-wardens in the Province of Canterbury, to en|quire
carefully and to return an Account of the distinct Numbers of Conformists,
Nonconformists and Papists in their several Parishes, viz. Of all such men and
women that were of Age to Communicate, c.
The number of Papists there returned was but eleven thousand, eight hun|dred
and seventy. Now tho in this Account Conformists and Nonconfor|mists
were not so distinctly, could not so justly be reckon'd, yet for the Papists they
being so few in each Parish and so notoriously distinguished as generally they are,
the Ministers and Church-wardens could easily give account of them, and there is
no reason to suspect their partiality, c.
In St. Martins alone I have heard of twenty or thirty thousand: but the
Account was taken there and as exact a one as could be, and I am assured by some
that should know and had no reason to misinform me that the number return'd
upon the most careful Scrutiny was about 600. I have found the like fallings
short of the reputed Number in divers other noted places. In one City talked
of for Papists as if half the Inhabitants were such, I am assured there are not

twenty Men and Women: In another large and popular one, a Person of Qua|lity
living in it told me, there were at least 600, but when the enquiry was
made by the Ministers and Church-wardens in each Parish, the Number was not
found to be 60; and 'tis very probable such a disproportion would be met be|tween
the reputed and real Numbers in all other places if Scrutiny were made.
In all the West and most Populous part of England they are very inconsiderable.
I hear frequently from Inhabitants of those places, that in Bristol the second or
third City of England there is but one, and in the City of Glocester one, or
two at most: in the other great Towns and Cities Westward scarce any, and
those that are in the Counties at large are extremely few, thinly scatter'd, here
one, and at the distance of many Miles, it may be another, c.
We hear of the vast Numbers in the North, and there are more no doubt in
those parts then in the Western: but I believe they are much fewer then we hear,
and no way able by their Numbers to make any kind of ballance for the exceeding
disproportion in the West.
The truth is People are mightily given and generally so to multiply the Num|bers
of Papists, and they do it in common talk at least ten-fold, c. And after
saith thereupon, God forbid, I should diminish the real force of our Enemies,
or endeavour to render us secure in dangers. The Malignity and Principles of
Papists, their unwearied zeal and diligence to overthrow our Religion, I very
well know and thank God that the whole Kingdom is awakened to apprehend:
but I think we shall encourage them and dishearten our selves, if we over magni|fie
their strength, c.
There came out in Print in London in the year 1680. a Sheet of Paper
called a Catalogue of the Names of such Persons as are or are reputed to be of
the Romish Religion, not as yet Convicted, being Inhabitants within the Coun|ty
of Middlesex, Cities of London and Westminster and Weekly Bills of
Mortality, exactly as they are ordered to be inserted in the several Commissions
appointed for the more speedy Convicting of such as shall be found of that Reli|gion;
a Paper, that was not Published I think by a friend to the Papists:
for the Author there Names them and the respective Parishes they lived in,
and the total number of Men and Women there was 317, of which only
one Man was there called Monsieur, tho yet six others seem'd to me there to
be of French Names; and one there has a Dutch Name, and only one per|son
in there call'd an Italian; so that notwithstanding the great Cry of For|raign
Papists in, and about London, they did but little more then make a
Number: and the persons there reckoned for St. Martins in the Fields are
but 22, and for Covent-Garden but 4, where yet the Bishops Survey makes
64, and for St. Margarets Westminster that Printed Paper makes but 4, of
which the Number it seem'd in 41, proved so dreadful to Justice How|ard.
St. Andrews Holborn has in that Paper but 6, which in the Bishops
Survey has 13. St. Giles in the Fields has in that Paper but 23, which
has in the Bishops Survey 126. The Savoy in that Paper has but 6, which
in the Bishops Survey has just the same Number, and St. Giles Cripplegate
has there but 2, which in the Bishops Survey has 20.
Of the care that was probably taken in those Parishes in London that
made Returns in that Survey, Covent-Garden-Parish, and some others are
Instances in one thing, namely that there are near so many houses as Re|turns
are made for, or not many more. Thus in Covent-Garden the Con|formists
return'd are 790: the Papists 64, the Nonconformists 6: and so
Servants and Children and Lodgers being not return'd (as Dr. Glanvile saith,)
the persons of Men and their Wives return'd in all there, are 860, which
agrees pretty well with the number of houses there which are about 460.

I suppose that Printed Paper by the Number of Inhabitants included only
House-keepers as the Bishops Survey did, and tho it is not to be doubted
but that when that Survey was made, there were in the respective Diocesses,
Deaneries and Parishes therein return'd, at least the full Number of the
Papists therein mention'd, yet the Popish Plot about two years after occa|sioning
the other Paper, it may be supposed that what by many Popish Fa|milies
removing out of the Realm, and what by many of them coming
to our Churches, the Number of the Popish Recusants did there considera|bly
decrease, as it has from the beginning of the Reformation gradually
done, unless in some particular Intervals, or Conjunctures, and is likely so
to do, till the uncouthness and strangeness of their Principles and Scarcity
of the persons that own them shall make them tolerable as Rari|ties.
I did before in this Letter thus far accord with Mr. Nye that Popery since
the Reformation may have sometimes acquired a new vigour, and that it
hath not always since its first assaults against Popery gain'd ground of it
proportionably, but whatever the Fate of the Ejected Puritan Divines in
Queen Elizabeth's days was, and whether deserv'd or not, and properly or not
timed, I enquire not (tho yet in our days the plenty of Conformist Di|vines
is such visibly that the supply of all our good Livings needs not crave
Aid from Dissenters) but do on all thoughts made persist in my opinion,
that Protestancy hath since its being first espous'd here as a Religion propa|gated
it self by the great encrease of its followers, except in some infecti|ous
Intervals of time, as I may call them.
Thus tho the Obsarvator on the Bills of Mortality hath taught us
as aforesaid that every Marriage with another produceth four Children,
yet in times of Pestilence (we are told by him) that the Christnings de|crease,
and that a Disposition in the. Air toward the Plague doth also dispose
Women to Abortion, and considering this, we may well infer, when the
Burials do much exceed the Births in any City rever (and not seeming|ly,
by the not Registring all the Births) that tho the Bills of Mortali|ty
tell us that there dyed then none of the Plague, and that there were
then Parishes infected with the Plague none, yet there is then a Pesti|lence
there Reigning. And thus is it a Pestilential time with a Church,
when more Apostatise from it then are born or as I may say regenera|ted
into it, or converted; and therefore by such times we are not to esti|mate
the encrease of the propagation of the Numbers of the Church of
England.
There was a time in Queen Elizabeth's Reign that the Reformation was
honour'd by all Englands, populace, being of a piece almost, and worshiping
God in the way prescribed with one heart and one mind: and then as we are
told by Sir Re. Cotton, p. 42, and 43. Of his considerations for repressing
the encrease of Papists, till the 11th of her Reign, a Recusants name was
scarce known, c. the name of a Papist smelt rank even in their own Nostrils,
and for pure shame to be accounted such, they resorted duly to our Churches: but
when they saw their great Coriphaeus Sanders had slly pinn'd the Name of
Puritans on the Sleeves of Protestants that encountred them with most courage
and percived that the word was pleasing to some of our own side, c. That
(saith he) brought plenty of water to the Popes Mill, and there will most
Men grind where they see appearance to be well serv'd.
But the accidental encrease of their Numbers in any Conjuncture was care|fully
regarded by the State, and to this purpose we are told it in Heywood
Townsends Collections, that Dr. Bennet acquainted the House of Commons
that there were 1500 Rcusants in Yorkshire, which he vouched upon his

Credit were presented in the Ecclesiastical Court, and before the Council at
York.
Popery it seems then gain'd ground in the poor North, having lest it in
the warm South, and to this day in the Northern parts of England where the
Livings generally are poor, the light of the Gospel hath not quite dissipated
the Mists of Popery, in somuch that if any one shall tell me that the Pro|vince
of York which bears but a 6th part of the Taxes, and hath not in it much
above a 6th part of the people that the Province of Canterbury hath, yet
contains at least the half of the number of Papists that the Province of
Canterbury doth, I shall not contradict his Estimate.
It is the Observation of Dr. Fuller in his Church History of the part of
England, Trent North, that 'tis scarce a third of England in ground, but al|most
the half thereof for the growth of Recusants therein.
And thus as the Observator on the Bills of Mortality hath observed
that Northern as well as Southern Countries are infected with great Plagues,
altho in the Southern Countries they are more vehement and do begin and end
more suddenly, it may be said that the infection of Popery doth yet continue
in our Northern parts.
But that the Papists valued themselves on their numbers throughout
England, toward the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's Reign, appears out of
that Pestilential Book of Father Parsons about the Succession, part. 2d,
where he weighs the several parties of England in the Ballance of State,
and saith, It is well known that in the Realm of England at this day there are
three different and opposite Bodies of Religion, that are of most bulk and do
carry most sway and power which three Bodies are commonly known by the Names
of Protestant, Puritants and Papists: and afterward speaking of the Great
Power of the Protestant Party for wealth and force. He saith p. 140. A
chief Member of the Protestant Body is the Clergy of England, especially the
Bishops and the other Men in Ecclesiastical Dignities which are like to be a
great back to this Party at that day, c. meaning the time after the death
of Queen Elizabeth, when her Successor should enter on the Stage: and
then having weighed the Puritan Party and its interest, he saith, The third
Body of Religion which are those of the Roman who call themselves Catholicks,
which is the least in shew at this present by reason of the Laws and Tides
of the time that run against them, yet are they of no small consideration in
this Affair to him that weighs things indifferently, and this in respect as well of
their Party at home as their friends abroad: for at home they being of two sorts
as the World knows, the one more upn that discover themselves, which are the
Recusants, and the other more close and privy that accommodate themselves to
all external preceedings of the time and State, so as they cannot be known or at
leastwise not much touch'd, we may imagine that their Number is not small
throughout the Realm, c.
The Vigour of the hopes that Popery had in that Conjuncture appears out
of that great Historical Letter of D'Ossat to his King, Anno 1601, where
he makes such a judicious abstract of this goodly Book of Parsons (for so he
calls it Ce beau livre) and Animadversions on it, and saith, 'Tis about four
years ago that the Pope did Create in England a certain Arciprestre to the end
that all Ecclesiasticks and Catholicks of the Realm should have one to whom
to go and have recourse about the things relating to the Catholick Religion, and
by means thereof to be united among themselves, and to understand what shall
be good to be done for their preservation and the re-establishment of the Catholick
Religion, and some have given his Holiness to understand that by that means he
would make a great Party of the Catholicks in England for what he would
effect, and then acquaints the King, That the Pope had sent three Briefs to

his Nuntio in the Low-Countreys for him to keep till the death of Queen Eliza|beth,
and after that to send them to England, one to the Ecclesiasticks, ano|ther
to the Nobility, and another to the third Estate; by which the said three
Estates are admonished and exhorted by his Holiness to remain united toge|ther
to receive a Catholick King that his Holiness shall name, and such a one
who shall appear acceptable to them and honourable, and all this for the Honour
and Glory of God, and for the restoring the Catholick Religion, c.
Here was it seems one Brief more sent to England then Mr. Marvel
mentions in his Growth of Popery, where he saith, That the Pope sent two
Briefs in order to exclude King James from the Succession to the Crown.
In fine, Popery was in a Storm during the Reign of Queen Elizabeth,
and in it the Papists were sometimes carried up to the Skyes, and then down
again, and in their Enterprizes with variety of success in some conjunctures,
their fortune was to reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man; and as in a
Storm many hands are necessary, so on the whole matter they found need
of the numbers of more hands then they could command, and their Num|bers
decreased in the ballance of the people here, as much by the King of
Spains Ambition, as did the numbers of the Papists in the United Provinces
thereby.
And as they look'd big on the account of their numbers in the latter end
of Queen Elizabeth's Reign, so they did in the beginning of King Iames's:
and as D'Ossat said in that Letter to Villeroy of April 2d, 1603. You will
find that the Spaniards who are most troubled about this Event (meaning of
the Succession) will be the first to Congratulate the King of Scotland, so it
happen'd here with the Papists, as appears by a Book in 4to, Printed for
Ioseph Barnes at Oxford, Anno 1604 called, A Consideration of the Papists
Reasons of State and Religion for toleration of Popery in England, intimated
in their supplication to the Kings Majesty and the States of the present Parlia|ment,
where in their Supplication at large Printed they in the beginning
thereof in a profession too as inauspicious as was possibly, say that His
Majesties direct Title to the Imperial Crown of the Realm both by Lineal Des|cent
and Priority of Blood, and your Highness most quiet access to the same do
exceedingly possess and englad our hearts.
The Tide of the Succession against which they had striven was made by
Fate to run smooth and clear, and they were resolved to appear on the Sur|face
of it with a nos poma natamus.
Gabriel Powel of St. Maryhall in Oxford, the Publisher of that Book
saith in his Animadversion on the said beginning of that supplication,
How can Papists without blushing acknowledge his Majesties Title to the
Crown of England to be direct, seeing they have heretofore most indirectly and
most unjustly oppugned the same; which Traiteous Parsons confesseth albeit for
excuse, he assureth himself that whatsoever hath been said, writ or done by any
Catholick against his Majesty which with some others might breed disgust, hath
been directed to this end, to make his Majesty first a Catholick and then our
King, as if Treason and Treachery against his Highness could make him a Ca|tholick,
and impugning of his direct and just Title, tended to make him King.
Rob. Parsons in his Treatise of three Conversions in the dedicat. Addition to
the Catholicks.
But tho they gave themselves (as it were) an Act of Oblivion as to the
many Treasons of Parsons his Book of the Succession, yet in this supplication
they forgot not again in effect to use Parsons his division of the people of
England into three parts, and so to shape the Estimates of their Numbers:
and they say in their first reason of State, the World knows that there are three
Kinds of Subjects in the Realm, the Protestant, the Puritan and the Catholicks

affected, and by general report the subject Catholickly affected is not inferiour to
the Protestant, or Puritan either in number or alliance, c. And saith Powel
in his Notes on that Clause, If by Catholickly affected you mean plainly Papists,
the World knows that in comparison of the Protestants they are but as it were a
handful of Thieves among honest Subjects, however you are bold to brag that at
this present there are within the Realm more Catholicks and Catholick Priests
then there were forty years since. Math. Kellison in his Survey in the Epist.
dedic. almost at the latter end.
They afterward in their Supplication use the word Catholickly affected to
make it comprehensive of both parts of Parsons his distinction of Papists,
more open, and close, and therein have the honour of the Invention of
the Phrase of Popishly affected, that hath so much gall'd them since, and at
this day continues to do: and I shall accord with them that the Number
of Papists or of Popishly affected was apparently grown great in the juncture
of time, after King Iames came here to the Crown: but 'tis not deniable
that after the Epoche of the Gun-powder-Treason, it did more sensibly de|crease;
for they cannot say that by the intended blow from the Gun pow|der,
they designed to make him Catholick in order to make him continue a
King.
The Dean of Bangor in his excellent Sermon in Print, and Preached at
St. Martins on the 5th of November, 1678. Speaking, p. 29, of the Con|spirators
in the Gun-powder-Treason saith judiciously, For the Number I be|lieve
the design it self was known to few, but that there was a design was known
to many more. King James himself tells us so in his works, p. 291. A great
number of my Popish Subjects of all Ranks and Sorts both Men and Women as
well within as without the Country, had a confused Notion and obscure know|ledge
that some great thing was to be done in that Parliament for the Weal of
the Church, tho for Secresies sake they were not to be acquainted with the par|ticulars.
And no doubt but that great Number took occasion to slip their Necks
out of the Collar of Misprision of Religion as well as of Treason thereupon, and
a vast encrease of the Numbers of the Protestants was thereby occasioned.
But there afterward appeared another Conjuncture of time in which the
Catholickly affected did in his Reign multiply in the which however implicit
faith could never come so much in fashion but that (as Gondomar observed
in the Kings Chappel) when ever the Preacher quoted Texts of Scripture,
the Auditors would immediately turn to their Bibles to find them.
Mr. Pryn saith in his Introduction to the Archbishop of Canterbury's Tryal,
p. 13. That the number of Priests and Popish Recusants enlarged out of Du|ress
by King James, if we may believe Gondomars Letter from hence to the
King of Spain, or the Letter of Serica that Kings Secretary, Dated from Ma|drid,
July 7th, 1622, to Mr. Cottington was no less then 4000. He had
before in p. 10. and 12. set down the Petition and Remonstrance intended to
be sent to King James by the House of Commons in December 1621, where
among other things 'tis said, That the Popish Recusants were then dangerously
encreas'd in their Numbers, and complaint is made of the swarm of Priests
and Iesuites dispersed in all parts of the Kingdom.
'Tis probable that not many Papists except Priests were then imprison'd,
and it may be conceived that the Number of Priests who escaped the Net
of Imprisonment was more then double to that which was took therein,
and that the Number of Lay-Papists was very growing in that Conjun|cture.
Mr. Iohn Gee's Book of the Foot out of the Snare of 4th Edition
Printed in London, 1624. mentions the Names of many Romish Priests

and Jesuites resident about London in that year, and begins with the
Bishop of Chalcedon, and shortly after him mentions Collington the Titular
Arch-Deacon of London, and Wright Treasurer for the Iesuites, and Smith
Vicar-General for the South parts of England, and Broughton Vicar-General
for the North parts of England, and Bennet Vicar-General for the West
parts of England, and the whole Number of them there named together
with the places of their Lodging, is two hundred sixty one: and the num|ber
of the Iesuites out of that Total is 72. Moreover out of that Total he
mentions only 3 as having been formerly in Prison in England, and but
one who was at that time in Prison. At the end of the Catalogue of the
Priests there he saith, These be all the Birds of this feather which have come
to my Eye or Knowledge by Name, c. yet above four times so many there are
that overspread our Thickets through England as appears by the empty Nests
beyond Sea, from whence they have flown by Shoals of late, I mean the Seminary
Colledges which have deeply disgorged by several Missions of them, as also is ga|thered
by particular Computation of their divided Trops: when as in one
Shire where I have abode sometime they are reputed to nestle almost three hun|dred
of this Brood.
In the following Pages he there Prints a Catalogue of Popish Physitians in,
and about the City of London, and makes the Number of them 27; and
no doubt but that in that Conjuncture of time the number of Papists en|creasing,
there were enow Patients of that persuasion to afford Livelyhoods
to so many Physitians.
In that Book immediately after p. 116. he Prints a Catalogue of such
English Books that he knew of to have been Printed, reprinted or dispers'd
by the Priests and their Agents in England within two years last past or
thereabout, viz. 156.
So fortunate was that Conjuncture to the Papists then that the odious
Name of Puritan was bestowed on any of the Magistrates that went to
put any Laws in execution against Popery, as we find it from Sir R. Cotton
in his serious Considerations for repressing of the encrease of Iesuites, Priests,
and Papists without shedding of blood, p. 33. his words there are, There is
no small Number that stand doubtful whether it be a gratful work to cross Pope|ry
or that it may be done safely without a foul aspersion of Puritanisme, or a
shrew'd turn for their labour at some times or other, c.
In the Petition and Remonstrance of the House of Commons in December
1621 before mentioned, among the Causes of the growing mischiefs here the
fifth Paragraph assignes one what would make Popery very prolific with Pro|selytes
here, viz. The strange Confederacy of the Princes of the Popish Re|ligion
aiming maily at the advancement of theirs and subverting ours, c.
and another is assigned in the 6th Paragraph, viz. The great and many Ar|mies
raised and maintained at the Charge of the King of Spain, the chief of
that League, and another in . 8th, The interposing of Forraign Princes and
their Agents in the behalf of Popish Recusants for Connivance and Favours to
them.
But in fine, in King Iames his Reign, the gross of the Number of the
Protestants was generally reckoned to be ten times greater then the Papists,
the which is hinted in the Posthuma of Cotton who then said, To what pur|pose
shews it to muster the Names of the Protestants, and to vaunt them to be
ten for one of the Roman Faction.
In the Reign of the Royal Martyr their Numbers decreased faster in
many active Conjunctures of time then they encreased in any lazy one.
The Author of the Regal Apology, and supposed to be Doctor Bate the
Physitian saith in p. 39. It is well known there are not 24000 Papists Convict|ed

in all England and Wales: And if we should suppose the Number of the
Papists then not Convicted to be double to that of the Convicted, yet
would such their number appear considerably dwindled from what it was
swoln to in any Conjuncture before in King Iames's Reign. And I believe
if our Civil Wars had not happen'd, one Canon even of the Convacation of
1640, as ill as that Convocation heard among many, I mean the third Ca|non
would have effected the extermination of Popery from England in the
Reign of the Royal Martyr.
The Title of the Canon is for Suppressing of the growth of Popery. No
doubt but a little before that time Popery did again lift up his head as if its
Redemption were to draw nigh in Ireland and England, and therefore the
Convocation then with great conduct and skill did lead up our Ecclesiastical
Hierarchy to confront its growth: and I do not remember to have found that
Phrase of the growth of Popery (which has in later days so filled our Mouths)
used in any Author before the writing of that Canon: and do think that
all the Committees that have been appointed to prevent the growth of Pope|ry,
or Books of that Subject have not produced to the World any means or
expedient so likely to make Popery have done growing here, as is the ex|cellent
Scheme for that purpose drawn in that Canon, and which when ever
it shall be with vigour executed will make our fears grow out of fashion ei|ther
of the number of the Arguments of the Papists, or of the Argument
of their Numbers.
That since that Restoration of our King and Laws, and of the discipline of
our Church, a Conjuncture hap'ned that made the barren Womb of Po|pery
here fruitful of Numbers none will deny, who consider how all our
great Divines of the Church of England did so lately lift up their voices
like a Trumpet against it, as I before observed.
In the account of the Numbers of the perswasions in Religion in the Pro|vince
of Canterbury that Dr. Glanvile said he had seen, and which is con|tained
in a Sheet of Paper, among the nine Preliminary Observations,
the first is, That many left the Church upon the late indulgence who before did
frequent it.
I believe by the many there are meant those that veer'd toward
Popery, and I suppose that few had for several precedent years repaired thi|ther
from fear of the Penal Laws.
We have a Remark given us by that Learned States-man and Noble Con|fessor
of the Church of England, the Earl of Clarendon in his judicious
Animadversions printed Anno 1673, on Cressy's Book against Dr. Stilling|fleet,
That the rude and boisterous behaviour of some of the Roman Catholicks
here disturbed the happy Calm they all enjoyed, and the vanity and folly of
others made that ill use of the Kings bounty and generosity toward them, that
they endeavoured to make it believ'd that it proceeded not from Charity and
Compassion toward their persons, but from affection to their Religion, and took
upon them to reproach the Church of England and all who adhered to it, as if
they had been in a condition as well as a disposition to oppress it, and to affront
and discountenance all who would adhere to it, and so alienated the affections of
those who desired they should not be disquieted and kindled a jealousie in others,
who had believed that they were willing to attempt it, and had more power to
compass it then was discerned, c. and this mischief the wisest and soberest Catho|licks
of England have long foreseen, would be the effect of that petulant and unruly
Spirit that sway'd too much among them, and did all they could to restrain it,
c. And afterward saith, As if they could subdue the whole Kingdom and so
care not whom they provoke.

A friend of mine in the Kings Loyal long Parliament wrote to me
for News after one of their Sessions, that the Speaker of the House of
Commons, Mr. Seymour opening according to the customary manner
in a publick Speech to his Majesty in the House of Lords, the nature of the
Bills then ready for the Royal Assent, spake thus concerning that sharp
one that will forever here cut Popery to the quick, viz. And for the severity
of this Bill to the Papists, they may thank their own petulant inso|lence.
The word petulant being very significant, and importing sawcy, malepert,
impudent, reproachful, ready to do wrong, one would suppose that those two
great observing persons would not apply it to any body of men without
just occasion.
It seems the House of Commons at their next Session in an Address to
the King, October 31. 1673. had this Clause, That for another age at the
least this Kingdom will be under continual apprehensions of the growth of Popery,
and the danger of the Protestant Religion, and in an Address to his Majesty,
November the 3d, 1673. Speaking of the Popish Recusants, they have
these words, whose numbers and insolencies are greatly of late encreased,
c.
It was then high time for that Great Minister of the King, the Earl of
Danby when he saw that of all Dissenters chiefly the Popish ones had
sascinated so many with a belief of their Numbers, to cause that great en|quiry
into them to be made, and it was his fortune by the very enquiry to
strip the Papists of many of their valued number, for the very next ob|servation
to that I before mentioned is this, The sending forth these Enquiries
has caused many to frequent the Church.
Alsted in his Chronology ventures to say, p. 112. David ex mer
 numerat populum, and the thing perhaps done with an
ill intent was punish'd with a Plague from God: but the Fact of our Noble
and Profound States-man did abate the Plague of the late Conjuncture of
pragmatical insolence, and too the Plague of the fear of Papists that was
then so epidemical among Protestants, and did in effect console us as with
the words of Elisha, viz. Fear not for they that be with us are more then they
that be with them: and indeed the numbering of people in the Bills of Mor|tality
who dye of the Plague is not more necessary to the State, then is the
numbring of the Souls infected in any Conjuncture with destructive opinions,
and the omission thereof in a publick Minister when ever it should be as
necessary as at that time it was, would appear in him a Lethargy that would
be as Penal as a Plague to a Kingdom.
That useful undertaking of his Lordship as it was worthy of his very
great abilities, and vigilance for the publick, so was it of the great power
he had in the Government, and could not have been conducted so far as it
was by any private persons: the Book called Popery absolutely destructive
to Monarchy, printed in London in the year 1673. shews the danger of or|dinary
Magistrates intermedling with the numbers of Papists in particular
Parishes, by instancing p. 115. how when the long Parliament was first call'd,
Iustice Howard was ordered to deliver up a Catalogue of all Recusants within
the Liberties of Westminster, to prevent which Mr. John James a Zealous
Popist stabb'd the Iustice in Westminster-hall: and Sir George Wharton in his
Gesta Britannorum saith Anno 1640. November 21. Iustice Howard assaulted
and stabb'd in Westminster-hall. It seems that Iustice of Peace as well as
Iustice Godfry found what it was to anger St. Peter, and so has that Noble
Earl done (I believe) by some Papists murdering his reputation and
shamming the Blood of Godfry on him in vallanous Pamphlets, of which I

hear that 32000 were dispersed in one Week, and that it appeared at an
Honourable Committee that no inconsiderable quantity of them was dis|pers'd
by Celier.
'Tis probable that the time that was taken for discovering the number both
of Papists and other Dissenters was most proper, in regard that the Declarati|on
of Indulgence visiting them as with a Sun-shine after the Rain, invited them
out of their Recesses to appear abroad visibly, and as the words of the Scrip|ture
in another sence are, To move out of their holes like Worms of the Earth.
And as if any man would give himself the trouble to essay the numbring of the
Worms that are in the Earth, the properest time for that his affected Curiosi|ty
would be after the Rain making the earth soft, and the Sun then warming
it had invited those Animals to come out of the Earth, the which lye within
a few Foot of the Surface of it; so for the above reason was the investigation
of the numbers of the Papists most properly timed.
I am therefore of opinion with the aforesaid Dr. That the number of the
Papists was near the matter retain'd with truth, and that their number is still
waining and will be so more and more, but in some accidental Conjunctures
of time.
A late Author hath publish't it, That in England in these twenty years
last past 250 Families of the Gentry and 12 of the Nobility have quitted the
profession of Popery.
And if any one shall affirm, as some considerate Papists have done,
that the number here of secret Papists and who go not to Mass is as great
as the number of the professed ones, I shall say that the number of the
people of England having been in this Discourse represented so much great|er
then it was in former Estimates, the number of secret Papists cast into
that of the known ones will perhaps signifie little more then the dust in
the Ballance of the Nation.
Their Numbers that did somewhat encrease in the beginning of the
Conjuncture of their petulant Insolence that went before the time of the
Popish Plot, as the Purples, Small-pox and other Malignant Diseases fore|run
the Plague, did sensibly and suddenly decay by the change of the Air,
that the Loyal long Parliament and its Act of the Test made, just as the Ob|servator
of the Bills of Mortality hath let us see that by the reason of the
changes and dispositions in the Air, the Plague doth by sudden Jumps start
back in a very few days time from vast numbers to very small ones: inso|much
that presently after the breaking out of the Plot they took the advan|tage
of the detection of the paucity of their Numbers, that the Earl of Danby's
aforesaid Prudence had made, as thence to raise an Argument ab impossibili
that they should design a Plot to turn the Tide of Nature in the Nation.
And thus as Men once pass'd the valuing themselves on the Charmes and
Vigour of Youth, do it for the Reverence of their Old Age, and hope to
be the better treated as Guests in the World for the shortness of the time
they are to stay in it, they did resemblingly too look big upon the smallness
of their Numes. The Author therefore of the Compendium printed
Anno 1679 tells us,  propos p. 85, That there are not 50000 of the Roman
Catholick Religion in England, Men, Women and Children, and that agrees
well enough with the Surveys of the Numbers of those of that Religion in
the Province of Canterbury of the Age of Communicants; and admitting
the Total of such to be doubled on the account of Papists below the Age
of Sixteen, an account that ought to be admitted, the Observator on the
Bills of Mortality having taught us (as aforesaid) that there are in nature
about as many under the Age of 16, as above it, and with the making
the Total of all the Papists in the Province of York, according to Fuller,

equal to that in the Province of Canterbury, the number of the Papists
throughout England will appear to be probably near what the Author of the
Compendium hath estimated.
That their Numbers did considerably decrease after the fermentation in
peoples minds relating to Religion followed the Declaration of Indulgence,
and after the severity of the Parliament to Papists thereby occasion'd, a
convincing Argument may be had from the Letters of Mr. Coleman, the
which did confute several imptations of it in Mr. Marvel's Growth of Po|pery
to the King's Ministers, better than any Apologies could have done,
and has enabled Fame to Trumpet them forth to Posterity as Confessors,
whom Envy here whisper'd to be Traditors; and let the present Age see
that their alledged Closing with Popery, was but in the way of conten|ding
Wrestlers, and not of friendly Embracers: And no doubt then but
the many Dependants and Followers those Ministers had, and the Candi|dates
for their favour and expectants of Offices thereby, were then Ene|mies
to all implicit Faith, but only for what they thought the Religion of
their Chiefs.
In his Letter to le Cheese of September 29, 1675, He saith, That the
Lord Treasurer, Lord Keeper, and Duke of Lauderdale were become as fierce
Apostles and as Zealous for Protestant Religion and against Popery, as ever
my Lord Arlington was before them, and in pursuance thereof perswaded
the King to issue out those severe Orders and Proclamations against Catholicks,
which came out in February last, by which they did as much as in them lay
to extirpate all Catholicks and Catholick Religion out of the Kingdom. And
he in his Letter to the Internuntio of the 5th of February 1674/5 tells him,
That the King had sign'd a Proclamation last Wednesday to banish all the
Priests, Natives of this Kingdom, to forbid all Subjects to hear Mass in the
Queens Chappel, and at the Houses of Ambassadors, to bring home all the
Youth that is now out of the Kingdom in any Popish Colledges, to prosecute all
Persons, as to their Estates, according to the Laws, which are so insupportable,
that 'tis impossible for any that is reach'd by them to have wherewithal to eat
Bread, if they be executed according to the said Proclamation.
It was but about October 1673, that the House of Commons in an Ad|dress
to the King, took occasion to say, It is now more then one Age that
the Subjects have lived in continual apprehensions of the encrease of Popery,
and the decay of the Protestant Religion; but what Mr. Coleman's apprehen|sions
were of the Growth of Popery on the 5th of February 1674, I have
shewn before, and am of opinion, That though possibly in the following
course of time to the birth of the Popish Plot, the coming of many Romish
Missionaries here might make some accession to the Number of the Pa|pists,
that however the Laity of them, here Inhabitants, hath in its Num|bers
sensibly decreased, and will do so more and more, till the most timid
Protestants shall be no more aggrieved at their Number, then of that of
the Muggletonians, or of the Sweet Singers of Israel.
That the discovery of the Popish Plot hath had a natural Tendency to
the abating the Number of their perswasion, must be granted by all who
believe there was one, and who know that the blustring attempts of the
Conspirators to subvert the Protestant Religion, and which have therein
failed, must end in the better settlement of it, as all Storms that do not
overthrow a Tree confirm its growth.
Mr. Care in his History of the Popish Plot, mentions, That the Iesuites
and Seminary Priests in England at the time of the Plot were about 1800, a
Number far inferior to that in the Conjuncture in King Iames's time be|fore
mention'd: And short of the Number mention'd by Prynne in a Book

of his, Printed Anno 1659, called A True and Perfect Narrative of what
was done, spoken by and between Mr. Prynne, the old and new forcibly Seclu|ded
Members, and those now sitting, c. where he saith, p. 44, That an Eng|lish
Lord return'd from Rome about four years since averr'd, that the Provin|cial
of the English Iesuites, when he went to see the Colledge in Rome, assured
him, That they had then above 1500 of their Society of Iesuites in England
able to work in several Professions and Trades which they had there taken up|on
them, the better to Support and Secure themselves from being discovered,
and infuse their Principles into the vulgar People.
Mr. Coleman complains of a Conjuncture as to Popery that he writ in,
that tho the Harvest was great, the Labourers were very few; but Mr. Prynne
supposeth the Labouring Jesuites who wrought in the Trade of Religion,
and in other Trades too, were here after the year 50 above 1500; and it
may therefore be well conceived that there were many Jesuites here beside
who could only manage their Tools in the former Trade, and perhaps as
many Seminary Priests as Jesuites: And no doubt without some hint of
notification from some one of the Iesuits Provincials, their Number in any
Protestant State can hardly be conjectured, in regard of their Proteus-like
varying their Shapes, accordingly as a Description of them is given in the
Book called, The Emperor and the Empire betray'd, where 'tis said, There
are in the Society of Iesus Men of several sorts, some of which are dispens'd
with not only to lay aside the Habit, but to marry and bear all sorts of Digni|ties;
and he further presumes to say, That the Emperor was thus in this
Order in his younger days.
Mr. Prynne in p. 42. of that Book averrs, That Oliver Cromwel declared
to his Parliament Anno 1654, That the Emissaries of the Iesuites then came
over in great swarms, and that they had then fixed in England an Episcopal
Power, with Arch-Deacons and other Persons to pervert the People: a thing
they never since the Reformation, I think, attempted in any Conjuncture
till Quarto Caroli, and then (as appears out of Rushworth's Collections)
in a Conference between the Lords and Commons, and managed by Secre|tary
Cook, he said, There was at that time a Popish Hierarchy established in
England, that they had a Bishop Consecrated by the Pope, and that Bishop
had his subalternate Officers of all kinds, as Vicars General, Arch-Deacons,
Rural Deans, Apparitors, and that they were not Nominal or Titular Offi|cers
only, but they all Executed their Iurisdictions, and made their ordinary
Visitations throughout the Kingdom, kept Courts, and determin'd Ecclesiastical
Causes.
But it appears not that they had any such Hierarchy here at the time of
the Plot, or that they have any thing like it at this time in this Realm.
Mr. Prynne tells us in p. 49. of that Book, That in that Conjuncture in
Cromwel's time above 30000 Popish Pamphlets were permitted to be Printed
and Vended in England, and that of this the London Stationers complain'd
in Print.
But 'tis very little that they have Printed here since the King's Restau|ration,
and the same private Presses which gave Birth to the few Pamphlets
they printed, would have done it to as many Volumes as ever Tostatus, as
Mr. Prynne writ, if they had pleased.
The great Number of the Protestants must still be naturally attractive
of the lesser to it, for the preservation of their Persons, tho at the price of
the diminution of their Numbers, as a drop is best preserved in the Sea,
tho it be there swallowed up. This Notion is well confirm'd by Edmund
Spencer in his Observations of the History of Ireland in former times, where
he shews in what course of time a handful of English, planted among the

Numerous Irish must of necessity become Irish, as indeed his own Family
there did, as I am told, and that Cromwel speaking to the Grand-child of
Spencer in English, that on the account of the Fame of his Ancestor he should
enjoy his Estate, was not by him understood.
And there is no doubt but time will illuminate the Papists as to the Pope's
Politicks being inconvenient to them, and only convenient to himself:
For the same Principle in Politicks that makes every lesser State have a re|gret
against being United to a greater, namely, for fear of its being absor|bed
thereby (a Notion lately in vogue when the Union of England and
Scotland was agitated) engageth the Pope to keep the Papists from a Co|alition
with the Protestants here, that would drown the visibility of their
Numbers, and consequently the appearance of the Numbers of his Subjects
in this Realm, for so in effect they are.
The true Cause therefore in Nature that made the Pope by his Bull in
Queen Elizabeth's time prohibit the Papists from continuing to come to
our Churches, and to our Common-Prayer, a thing they would else still have
done, was the Pope's being enabled by such Prohibitions to put Marks on
his Sheep whereby to know them, and their Numbers: And which had
he forborn, there had probably been no Number of them returnable in the
Bishops Survey.
'Tis therefore not to be wondred that our Church got nothing but the
destruction of its Hierarchy in the last Age, by the Policy used then by
some of our well-meaning Church-men, who thought that the use of some
Ceremonies more than our Law required would have brought the Church
of Rome over to us. 'Tis aut Caesar aut Nullus that the Pope would be; and
he will here keep as many Subjects as he can, since not able to acquire as
many as he would. And the truth is, as the attempt of an excellent Swim|mer
to save one totally inexpert therein usually proves fatal, so likely will
the generous and charitable design of a Church of a rational Discipline in|terposing
to save one of an irrational, and that can do nothing by vigour
of reason to bear up it self, and is therefore meer dead weight.
Since the Epoche of the Popish Plot that the Press has been to all wri|ting
Mankind so much unrestrain'd, the World hath seen little of the Pa|pists
Learned Writings, or scarce any thing writ with Art and Wit, except
the Compendium, and instead of proving in Volumes that the Church of
England is no true Church, or that St. Peter was ever at Rome, they have
extended all the Nerves of their Wit in Pamphlets, only to prove that
Doctor Oates is no true Doctor, and that he was never a alamanca.
And I believe that as the asserting of Popery here, per viam Tho|mae,
(or in the way of the Schools) is in the Course of Nature Eternally
over, so will the adorning it by the way of Curiosity of Wit or Fancy grow
obsolete.
But here it is proper to be observed, that in all the Conjunctures before
mention'd, and in those wherein our former Protestant Princes for deep
reason of State have been most favourable to their Popish Subjects by the
Relaxation of the Penal Laws, and when some Papists made great Figures
in the Court, and got the Ballance of Court-preferment a while by stealth
into their hands, and that Holy Church being anew Whiten'd over with
some temporary Prosperity, many Proselytes did Flock to it as Doves to
their Windows, yet the Ground that Popery got then was but Made Ground
and not natural, and was too chargeable to be kept. And as the vulgar
have falsly imagined that a great Plague has happen'd in the beginning of
every Princes Reign, so has it been obvious to the more refined observers,
that in the Reign of every new Protestant Prince, Popery has made a fresh

essay to augment it self in the Epocha of a new Conjuncture. And that as
in the most Pestilential times of Mortality, even in our Metropolis, almost
only the poorer sort of People are swept away by it, Thus was it too in
in those Conjunctures here, when Popery boasted of its many Con|verts.
But Nemo decipit lumbos, and Popery when pamper'd, did but Counter|feit
a sound strength, and as Quintilian's words are, Verum robur inani sa|gin
mentiri, and was but in bad travelling Case by that washy adventiti|ous
flesh, and soon tired in its furious Race; while Protestancy had that
permanent Motion which Dr. Iackson on the Creed supposeth the Heavens
would have if God should move them in an instant, and which if he did,
were (he saith) more properly to be called A vigorous permanency, allu|ding
perhaps to things seeming to stand still when they move fastest. Dr.
Twisse in answer to him doth to the Expression of a Permanent Motion,
with a mirth and raillery unusual in him, apply that Verse of a Poet whose
Horse being tired, and not moveable by the Spur, said to his fellow Tra|veller,
who Rein'd in his Horse to go easily; Your Horse stands still faster
then mine will go. And thus (raillery apart) I do believe that Protestancy
will stand still faster than Popery can go, let it be never so high mounted:
And we may properly resemble the course of Protestancy in any Conjun|cture
to the Sun, which enjoys its Natural Motion at the same time it
suffers its Forced, and according to Mr. Cowley's Expression doth at the
same time run the day and walk the year.
And we may as properly resemble the height and greatness of Popery
in any former Conjuncture, and the greatness of Peoples fears of its Growth
and Continuance to the dreadful Entrance and dull Exit of a Comet.
Many Comets have hung over our heads, and lasted some considerable
time, that were bigger than the Globe of the Earth, which as they appear'd
on a sudden, so hath that great Mass of Matter, of which they consisted,
and which threat'ned destruction to the Earth, by little and little dwindled
to nothing, or disappear'd. And this hath been the Event of the Growth
of Popery, and over-growth of its Fears here, and I believe will be in any
Conjuncture that can come.
I believe that if such an extremely improbable thing should ever happen,
as that the Legislative Power should allow the Papists a publick place for
their Devotion in every great City in England, the very sight of their Ce|remonies
would encrease and sharpen the Popular aversion against their
Church.
Du Fresnes in his Learned Glossary in three Tomes, as to the Scriptores
mediae  infimae Latinitatis, mentions the origination of the use and name
of the Surplice, and quotes Durand in Ration. lib. 3. c. 1. n. 10. 11. for it, viz.
Eo quod antiquits super tunicas pelliceas de pellibus mortuorum animalium
factas induebatur, quod adhuc in quibusdam Ecclesiis observatur: And cites
many Authorities about its being used by the Clergy; and while the An|tient
Monks lived upon the labour of their hands, and wore such Leathern
Clothes as labouring Rusticks in the Towns with whom they wrought,
it was but a necessary piece of decency when they retired to their Orato|ries
to Worship God together, to have that covering of Linnen that might
hide the sordidness of their Clothes, and so probably that Linnen Surplice
appearing in it self decent, and carrying with it more respect from the
just Reverence those Innocent Ancient Monks attracted, it came by that
means first in fashion in the Church to be worn by the better habited
Priests, and being here enjoyn'd by the Laws of our Sovereign, and therein
declared to be a thing not in its own nature necessary, it seems to me to

be an uncivil humour in our Dissenters so much to quarrel the use of it;
and do suppose that the Civility of the French Nation appearing in the
Protestants of that Realm, who are here, and to whom it is natural not
only to comply with Princes but even their fellow Subjects in the use of
all Ceremonies they expect to be treated with, may instill such a humour
of Complaisance into some of those here who were aggrieved at our Chur|ches,
or, as I may say, our Kings Ceremonies, as all the Learned Books of
our Divines have not yet done.
But if after the disuse of our Ceremonies in the late Usurpation the sight
of a Surplice doth fright them so much from our Church, how would they
be disgusted to see one with a shaven Crown, with his Amice Girdle, Aube,
Maniple, Stole, Chesible, and other pretended holy Vestments, and see him
use Crossing, Turning, Ducking, Lifting, Whispering, Gaping, mingling of Wine
and Water, Lickings, and other variety of Gestures, and to hear Prayers in
Latine, and to the Saints, and for the Dead, and to have our Bells Baptised,
to have Vailes, Holy-Water, Holy-Ashes, Palms, c.
Erasmus saith in his Epistles, p. 108. Ep. 10. An hic sacrificulum illum
malunt imitari qui suum mumpsimus quo fuerat viginti usus annos, mutae no|luit,
admonitus  quopiam sumpsimus esse legendum? The Verse of Scripture
in which he read that word, was Iosua 9. 12. En panes quando egressi sumus
de Domibus nostris ut veniremus ad vos Calidos [Mumpsimus] nunc sicci facti
sunt  vetustate nimia Comminuti, no other Verse appearing to me by the
Concordance of the Vulgar Latine to have Sumpsimus in it: And the fol|ly
of the Priest in so reading was so famous as to come to the knowledge
of our Harry the Eighth, and to occasion his saying (as my Lord Herbert
tells us) Some of the Clergy are too stiff in their old Mumpsimus, others too
curious in their new Sumpsimus.
But that Verse in Iosua was as unlucky and as ill boding a one to Popery
for a Priest thus to signalize en ridicule, as any he could have found in
Holy Writ, and carries in it self a revenge for its barbarous usage: For
it naturally suggests to People that the Antiquity of the Doctrine of Pope|ry
is but a Gibeonitish or meer pretended one, and that even its Transubstan|tiated
Bread is not brought from so far a Country as is pretended, and that
it was no longer ago then Anno 1212, that Innocent the Third in the Late|ran
Council brought in Transubstantiation as an Article of Faith, and De|creed
those to be Exterminated who did not believe it, And that Kings
were to be compelled to Exterminate them, and that the Pope had power to
depose Kings, an effectual way to put not only the nature of Things but
Men on the Wrack, and then make them say they believe any thing.
But we having been used to the New Sumpsimus these hundred years,
shall be so Curious in it as to make what is barbarous the object of our
Mirth, as much as Harry the Eighth and Erasmus did, and the Novelty of
Popery coming again here in the Masquerade of Antiquity, would appear
as nauseous as would the moudly Bread of the Gibeonites to the Men of
Israel, if they had come to treat them with it a Second time.
From what hath been in this Historical way glanced at, concerning the
gradual decreasing Popery here in the several past Conjunctures, we may
without the Amentia Prophetiae (as Tertullian calls it) say, That in any
Conjuncture that can hereafter come it will more and more decrease, and
that under any new Prince Protestancy will be the Rising Sun, whose
light will be then encreasing, and Popery acquire no more lustre then the
short one of a parelius.
Doleman alias Parsons in his Book Of the Succession, publishing his thoughts
how ponderous the Papists would be in the Ballance of State in the Con|juncture

of time attending the next Successor, speaks thus, as if it were
before him in Vision, With these many others do joyn; Et omnes qui amaro
animo sunt cum illis se conjungunt, as the Scripture saith of those that fol|lowed
David's Retinue (1 Kings 12.) pursued by Saul and his Forces, which
is to say, that all that be offended, grieved, or any way discontented with the
present time, be they of what Religion they will, do easily joyn with these
Men.
And when I consider how many there are, qui amaro sunt animo, by
reason of their Condition being embitter'd by Poverty, and that it hath
pursued them like an Armed Man, and is likely so to do; when I consider
that the Multitude of Free-Schools in the Kingdom, diverting the Educa|tion
of the poorer sort of our Youth from useful laborious Trades, to the
uselesly appearing Scholars and Gentlemen, or (according to the Dutch
word) Idlemen, hath at last brought them but to fragments of knowledge
and likewise of Bread, and tho wearing better Habits then their Ance|stors,
yet to be little better than Thiefs in a handsome disguise, robbing
the World of their Labour, and its own quiet by their being Sollicitors,
Make-bates, Informers, proulers into the rights of other Mens Estates,
Tamperers with Witnesses, Tales-men, Promoters of Office, Suers of o|thers
in the way of qui tam, c. quam, c. And when I consider what is
so truly observ'd by the Author of Britannia languens,. That of all other em|ployments
we have the greatest questing after Offices, that Men will almost
give any thing, say any thing, do any thing for an Office, so that some Offi|ces
that were thought hardly worth the medling with of late years, will now
yield near Ten years Purchase for one Life; And when I every where be|hold
the trn Limbs of the Estates of so great a Party among us as may
be call'd the Luxuriants, and who have sold the same Estates and Consci|ences
three or four times over, and do likewise recollect the Number of
all such Idle men, who have been observed of late years in Shoales so much
to depopulate the Country to plant themselves about London, insomuch that
tho according to the Observator of the Bills of Mortality there usually
did come out of the Country to live in London but 6000, yet there dying
within those Bills 17249 in the Year 75, and 18732 in the Year 76, and
19064 in the Year 77, and 20678 in the Year 78, wherein the Popish
Plot was discovered, and 21730 in the Year 79, whence according to the
Rule of one in 30 Yearly dying, and there having dy'd gradualy above
a 1000 a year since the year 75 to the year 80 (altho all years of ordi|nary
health) so the remaining part in London did thence appear gradual|ly
encreased proportionably, that is, as a 1000 dy'd each year more than
other, so 29000 lived there each year more than in the other, and that
there lived in the year 79 in London 120000 more than did in the year
75, and that many of these People having broke in the Country, through
the Poverty that the Plot occasion'd, came to London to hide themselves
and their shame: I say, when I consider all these things, I may well con|clude
that all these Indigents will be ready to hope for a Golden Age, and
call any thing a Religion that will bring it them: And by a new shuf|fling
of Religion will be indeed hoping for better Cards in this World.
Some of those who have been Trumpeters to the Puppet-Shows of little
Enthusiastick Religions, and movers of the Wyres there, would if ever the
great one of Popery should come on the Stage, be glad to be sharers or
quarter sharers in it, and to be either Actors or Ministerial to them, and
especially to be applauding Spectators when by the ill Poets of the Play,
they shall be well paid to line the Pit Boxes, and Galleries to cry it up: and
thus the Wit and Philosophy of a great Lady have been Celebrated in the

Vniversities by Heads of Colledges, and lodged there in Libraries on the
expectance of her being a Benefactress.
And if any Tecelius would come not as a sturdy Pardon-Pedlar as before
to require Mony (the which thing then proved so destructive to Popery)
but to distribute it, there would be enow to receive it; and among the In|digents
for a while, according to the Stylus curiae Romanae in Mr. Colemans Let|ter
of March the 12th 74, to the Internuntio, a little Mony, I say a very lit|tle
will do.
But Conclamatum est as to the state of Religion it self as well as of the
Power of any Prince, when men come to be bought by him either into Re|ligion
or Loyalty. The profusion of Money in the way of Legacies by any
one, is a sign of his being near his end, and Tacitus therefore saith it not
improperly of Otho, Pecunias distribuit parce nec tanquam periturus. And
thus is any Princes Power and likewise Religion near expiring, when once
he comes to buy of Hydras heads, as Mr. Hobbs's expression is in his
History of the Civil Wars.
I know that it hath been the common practice of Kings to buy of Dema|gogues,
and some of their Ministers have perhaps been apt to think that those
who formerly were by their Artifices able to make the Disease of Sedition
in the minds of the people, had likewise the greatest skill to cure it; in like
manner as any Doctor of Phsick who could make a Quartan Ague, or any
other Disease, would be held in the greatest repute for ability to cure it, it
being perhaps more easie to make a Disease then to cure it, as composition is
more easie then Analysis and Multiplication then Division: but the too dear
bought experience of Princes, hath seal'd the Probatum est, in this case of
all popular Wizards, losing their power of charming, when they have been
Captivated with Royal gifts, Witches according to the vulgar received opi|nion,
being unable to hurt when they are in Jayles.
There is another Notion I dscanted largely on before, and that overstocks
the Market of expectants to be bought off, Namely, that all men naturally
think themselves equally wise, and therefore as any Ship that sails faster then
another, is in the Sea-phrase said to wrong it, so are men apt to think them|selves
wrongd by those who with Gales of Court preferment get beyond
them.
Moreover tho the power of Gold be still what it always was namely the
most ductile thing in nature next to degenerate Man made ductile by it;
yet will any Prince be impoverish'd who buys Gold or Men of golden
Abilities and great Parts too dear by Preferments and Donatives: for
such Donees will be Continuando-beggers, and everlasting expectants of fur|ther
Gifts, and their conversion either to a Princes Interest of State or Reli|gion
must be still nourished by the same thing it was made of; and there|fore
it was worthy the wisdom of Solomon to observe, That he that oppres|seth
the Poor, and giveth Gifts to the Rich, shall surely come to want.
And most certainly here, as in France, the Play of a Prince who shall use
that Game to win Souls, will not be worth the sorry Candle of Conversion he
shall light up; and the Conversion of Sharpers will be of such who will
soon run away with the stake of their Souls they have laid down.
The Fisherman of Rome St. Peter's pretended Successor, can neither in
France, nor here with a drag-net of Conversion, catch thousands of Souls at
a draught, as St. Peter elsewhere did: but must Angle for every Convert,
and that with a golden Hook, of which the value is more considerable to
be lost, then is that of the Fish to be taken, and from which Hook too it
can invisibly get off at pleasure.

A Prince of that Religion will have more occasion for the multiplying
Miracle of the Loaves, then that of Transubstantiation; and the Multitude
that follow his Converters for the former Miracle, will be apt as soon to leave
him as they did our Saviour who followed him on that account.
The Observator on the Bills of Mortality shews us, that in December 1672.
The Protestants in Paris were but as one to 65: and 'tis confessedly true on
all hands, that the great Scene of the late French Conversions lies in Paris,
and even there the present Ecclesiastical Policy is to Attaque te Fleet of
the Hereticks, rather by Merchant-men then by Fire ships. I have never
heard of any Bishops Survey of the persuasions there relating to Religion,
but in the Index of Mersennus his Comment on the first 6 Chapters of
Genesis, I find it said, Atheorum numerus Luteciae, p. 671. and Athei in Gall,
Germani, Scoti, Poloni, p. 673. I could find neither of those places in the
body of the Book; but observe that in the Learned Fryars Dedicatory
Epistle to De Gondy the Archbishop of Paris, he says, Quibus addo te hujus
urbis  orbis Parisiensis ut vigilantissimum Praelatum sapientissim constitutum
esse, in qu sicut eximiam plurimorum virtutem atque pietatem admiramur, 
multorum etiam infesto  immani scelere longissim abhorremus: ad cujus fasti|gium
non video quid adjungi possit, cum numen omne pernegent,  ex eorum
mente quibuscum familiariter degunt, sensum Divinitatis,  consensum pro viri|bus
evellunt. Quamobrem impii suorum numerum in hac Parisiorum luce in|gentem
esse aiunt atque gloriantur. But I have heard some more conversant
in that Book then I have been, relate, how that great Master of Numbers
doth make the Atheists in Paris to be 20,000: and it being justly to be sup|posed
that those 20000 Miscreants being wretchedly poor (for that as
Aristotle has long since well observ'd, rich men are naturally  or
lovers of God, who hath provided so well for them) they would presently
seem Protestants to qualifie them for turning Papists, and receiving their
Conversion Money, and would say as of old, accipe pecuniam  dimitte asinum,
and instantly swell up the number of Converts in Paris. But Popery gains
nothing in reality by those fugitive Converts: for the Fool that saith in his
heart there is no God, will be easily brought to say in his Soul, there is no
Soul: and therefore say I, caveat emptor to Messieurs the French Converters:
the volatile Converts for a good quantity of solid Gold, sell them but a
little Quicksilver, or rather Smoak: and I think they may as well employ
their Money in converting the Poysoners.
There is another thing that makes it very impolitick thus to throw a|way
good Money on bad Converts, and that is what hath been observed to
be the effect of this expenceful project in France; namely, that it makes
the remaining part of the Adherents to their former Religion to be really
the more strong, powerful and united. The Wine that was at first in colder
weather preserved by the Lees in it, yet in the hotter season improves best
by being rack'd off the Lee, and thus it is with the Adherents to a Religion,
when in the heat of Persecution they are defecated from the viler part of
its Numbers.
But yet on the other hand the Mercenary Religionists and Religion-tra|ders,
do grow impoverished with their very Gifts, and the vigour of their
minds, and natural disposition to industry is thereby emasculated. I shall
here once for all say, that by the word Religion-Trade, I intend no prophane
reflection on Religion as 'tis in the Scripture sense, the calling of a Chri|stian:
but 'tis they that prophane it, who by prostituting that high Calling
(as St. Paul styles it) to low and vile ends, do indeed miscall it, and oc|casion
others to do so too. And indeed we are out of the Sacred Writ ad|vertised
of the Religion-Trade and Religion-Traders. St. Peter gives

the Alarm of False Teachers, that shall through Covetousness with
feigned words make Merchandise of them: And one Chapter in the
Apocalypse, as generally interpreted by Protestants, makes his pretended
Successor to deal in the Merchandise of Gold and Silver and Precious Stones,
and Pearls, c. and Slaves and Souls of Men. And as in Rome at present,
and long since, the only considerable Trade that is driven, is that of Reli|gion,
there being scarce any Secular Merchants there but Iews, and those
too chiefly dealing in Frippery, so is the great Trade thence forced upon
the World from the Apostles See, relating to the Souls of Men. 'Tis
there the great Bank of Souls is kept, and the security of Rome is expos'd
for that Bank, as that of the whole City of Amsterdam for its Bank, the
which doth not more enrich the Merchants that deal with it by saving to
them the expence of their time, and preventing their receiving of bad Mo|ney,
then the other Bank of Souls doth impoverish its Merchants by de|frauding
some of their good Money, and others of their pretious Souls by
it, and by the lavish wasting of the time of others, and making them who
embanked their Talents of good Natural Parts and Wit there, but in effect
to wrap them up in a Napkin, and both by believing some of the Papal
Tenets, and by being paid so much and no more for the same, and not
providing for their Families as they might have better done by substantial
and even Mechanical Trades, to be worse then Infidels.
'Tis but Natural to Suppose that a Man of two Trades will neither to
any high Degree improve them, or his Estate by them, suitably to him
who minds wholly one Trade: And the adventitious gain of a Man in
any Profession, who is a Religion-Trader doth but entice him to the idle|ness
whose effects render him unfortunate in both; and therefore I ac|count
that the See of Rome, unless it could pretend to infinity of Treasure,
as well as Infallibility of Judgment, and whereby it might plentifully by
Pensions tye all its Devoti only to the Religion Trade, loseth its Oyl and
Labour in the largesses it affords Men of other Trades.
The prying People of England, next to their Algebraing out (as I may
say) the Authors of Murder, have that Curiosity too to discover the ways
by which any of their Neighbourhood do subsist, and when they knew
them to have no Paternal Estates, nor to have acquired any by Marriages,
or by Skill and Industry, and Success in their particular Professions, yet
see them live with Equipage and Splendor, they often with Justice resolve
the Cause of their Living so, into the Contributions they receive from the
Religion-Trade: But yet 'tis a Familiar thing to observe that other Artists
in the same Secular Calling with them are therein more diligent, and more
dextrous, and more thriving, and too more frugal (as having that only to
depend on for their Maintenance) then such Journey-men of Rome as are
aided in their Expences by Contributions from Holy Church, by which
the births of their Fortunes are thus in a manner over-laid.
Of trading Persons and Companies being undone by Donatives, and
being diverted from necessity, compelling them to an excellence there|in
by their being provided with Golden Bridges to retreat from want
and hard labour by, we have a remarkable instance in Stw's Survey of
London, where he inserts the famous Will of Mr. Iohn Kendrick Citizen and
Draper of London, who dy'd in the year 1624, wherein he, for the ad|vancement
of the Woollen Manufacture in certain Country Corporations
that were then and before Eminent for and by that Manufacture, bequeath'd
great Sums of Mony to them, as for Example, to Redding 7500 l. and
4000 l. to Newbery, and moreover ordered 500 l. to be lent gratis to the
Clothiers of Newbery and Redding; but under the weight of that Charity

of his their Trade was in the event really depressed, and many Merchants of
London occasionally broke by that means.
And sutably to the Operation of the Religionary Trade and the other
Secular one, impoverishing several of our Iesuited and other Lay-Papists,
the late times gave us the Experience of several Tradesmen who being
of a slothful disposition, thought it for their ease to get some little Sala|ries
from the State, or voluntary Contributions from some of the Sectarian
Populace to eek out their Maintenance, and that particularly under that
great Idol Oliver Cromwel, who so fatally ruin'd the Trade of England, and re|sembling
the Pope in being a Cape Merchant of Souls, was not undeservedly
in the time of his Reign greeted in print by the Title of  by a
Reverend Divine of the Church of England, the which was applyed to
Oliver in the Title of the Book, and he it was that begger'd the Nation,
and then taught it to Cant; and then did that Pharoah otherwise then in
a Dream make the lean Cattle of Canting Words and Phrases devour the Fat
of the Land, and much of solid improvement, even in Mechanical Arts and
Sciences, and then it was that various Clanns or Corporations of Canters
only by being such, Monopolis'd the Preferments of Church and State,
and few were admitted to prattique there but such who had the Plague,
and were as idlers, pests to the Kingdom, and who had Embanked their
Souls in that great Religionary Bank of his setting up: And yet then
those adherents of his that sold the Wind of inspiration were in compa|rison
of the substantial other Traders, who soly depended on excelling in
their particular Trade, as poor almost as the Lap-landers who sell other
Winds.
But that which is much more Momentous than the impoverishing of all
these Particular Religion-Traders, and even the diminution of Trade in
general, ensuing the profusion of profit by donations on the account of
Religion, is that Religion it self is hereby impoverished, and its most
vital part Sincerity hereby in danger to be exterminated. For as 'tis a
thing well known to Merchants and Goldsmiths and Mint-Masters, that if
the Par (as they call it) or exact Proportion between Gold and Silver be
not observ'd in any Country, either the Gold will carry all the Silver out
of it, or the Silver all the Gold; so it may be affirm'd too, That if there
be not a Par or Proportion observ'd as to Religion and Profit or Wealth,
either the Religion of a Country will carry out all the profit or Proven|tus
of it, or the profit will carry out or exterminate Religion. I will
not therefore here Prophecy that the World will never, but say that it can
never be fixed in a quiet and orderly State, and free from the Importu|nity
and Sedition of Hypocrites till its Present State be such that Men
can neither get nor lose by Religion: And till the World recovers this
Golden Age, namely, that Gold cannot carry out our Religion, (and Peo|ple
us with Hypocrites) or our Religion Gold, the World will be but a
great disorderly House and scarce worth any Mans being Monarch over
it.
As the Irish call their last Rebellion by the name of the Commotion, so
some have happen'd to call the Present State of Peoples Minds in England
which is so disorderly by the name of a Fermentation, and this Fermenta|tion
can never be over in our English World, till there shall here be nei|ther
profit or loss by Religion, and that no Man shall be more or less Rich
by more or less Combining with any Party, to cry up or decry any Re|ligionary
Tenets or Propositions.
One would wonder that since Religion, and particularly the Christian,
with its Credenda doth Crown the reason of Man, and likewise annex by

the exuberance of the Divine benignity a Crown of Glory hereafter to the
Believers, that any Men should for their belief of Propositions not con|trary
to reason, and wherein the credit of the propounder was supported
by Miracles, expect to be rewarded in this World, a humour that hath
been regnant even among Christians, from the time of our Saviour's be|ing
on Earth to the present Age, and a humour that so poyson'd the Iews
of old, that they thought it not Tanti to have their minds freed from the
slavery to Error, unless the Messias would have deliver'd them from the
servitude of the Romans (and because he did not, and did decline the be|ing
made an Earthly King when the Iews with their Hosannas were temp|ting
him to it, they Accused him Capitally for saying That he was a King,
whenas it was not he, but they that said it, and they put him to Death
rever because his Kingdom was not of this World) and a humour that
would not quit the Stage when the first Christians did, but boldly still
faced the World, as appears by the notion of the Millennium having been
so much applauded by all the Fathers of the Church and the Christians
before the first Nicene Council.
But methinks from the Example of the Christians of old who did Am|bire
Martyrium to such a degree that St. Gregory saith, Let God number our
Martyrs, for to us they are more in number then the Sands (as if the work
had been too hard for another Archimedes with his Arenarius to Calcu|late
the number of the Martyr'd Christians, and one Author accounts that,
excepting on the first of Ianuary, there is no day for which Records do
not allow 500 Martyrs at least, and that for most days they allow 900,
and who did ennoble the Christian Religion, by shewing to the World an
Example of Contempt of Death, and even of Life beyond that of the An|cient
Romans) I say from the Example of those Christians who did in shoals
dye daily for their Religion, Ours may, if they please, be taught the mo|desty
not to expect daily livelihoods from it, and to account they have ve|ry
fair play if they do not lose their livelihoods by it.
'Tis moreover observable that under the Iewish Theocracy Providence
had then so ordered things, that no Man should get or lose by Religon.
The Tribes had then their shares of the good Land by lott, and the Levites
only had that affluent proportion of the Proventus of the other Tribes
that I have before Calculated, and which would have tempted many of
the other Tribes to have march'd over to the Officium and Beneficium of
the Priesthood, had not God their Monarch provided against that, by the
confinement of the Administration of the Priesthood to one Tribe, and its
descendents by natural generation.
But as to the notion of getting or losing by Religion, I shall recommend
to your Lordships reading a small Pamphlet printed in two sheets of Pa|per
in Folio, and call'd The great Question to be consider'd by the King and
this Parliament, c. to wit, How far Religion is concern'd in Policy or Ci|vil
Government, and Policy in Religion, c. On the disquisition of which a
sufficient Basis is proposed for the firm settlement of these Nations to the most
probable satisfaction of the several Parties and Interests therein, and subscri|bed
by the name of Philo-Britanicus.
Who the Author of it was I cannot learn, but do easily find by the
Book that he is a Man of great Acumen of thought, and that Matters of
Religion and State, especially relating to this Kingdom, have been very
much thought of by him, and that the Author was certainly neither Pa|pist
nor Presbyterian, and so far from being a favourer of the Church of
England that he doth interminis make the publick Maintenance of the
Clergy to have been the Bone of Contention in these Nations, p. 8. and

there saith, It will be found to stand on the same foot with Abbies and Nne|ries
and their Lands, and there further as a propounder would give all the
Church-Lands to the Crown, and the Tithes to the People; and then tells
us, That all Fears and Iealousies and Animosities on the account of Religion,
will be pluck'd up by the Roots. That Author in p. the 5th doth very acutely
observe, That Popery hath two Parts, the one is that which is meerly Religi|ous,
that is which relates properly to Religion or Conscience, and which is peculi|ar
to them, such as the believing of Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Adoration of
Saints and Images, yea, and the superiority of the Bishop of Rome over other
Churchmen, all which and those of this kind may be believed and professed
without prejudice to Civil Society, and as being matters relating to Conscience
come not properly under the Magistrates Cognizance: the other part is the opi|nion
of the Pope's Power over Princes and States, his obsolving the people from
their Obedience, his giving them dispensations to kill Princes and destroy them,
and allowing them not to keep faith to Hereticks and such like, which as they
are destructive to Government, are truly no part of Religion, but a politick
contrivance, long hatch'd by the Bishop of Rome and his dependants for the esta|blishing
to himself a firm Monarchy in the World, and therefore ought to be
guarded against and punished by the Magistrate, not as errors in Religion, but as
destructive to the Government.
The Author of Omnia comesta  Belo as great a Calculator as he would go
for, was yet but a Blunderer in respect of the Author of this discourse, in
which there is so much smoothness of words and plausibleness of notion,
that if it were possible he would deceive some of the very Elect, and that too,
of their Established Maintenance.
But whatever the Sentiments of that Author were, I must affirm that
as ample as the Revenue of the Church of England shews, if compa|red
with that of other Protestant Countries, it is yet so far from excess in
its proportion as to ward off all inconveniences from the State of mens
getting by Religion.
The over ballance of Land here was so much on the Churches side in
the times of Popery, that it was then in our Provincial Constitutions sulmi|nated
as a Menace to the Layety that in case of some particular Contumacy,
none of their Children should be admitted into the Clerical Calling for three
Generations.
But how Nugatory would such a threatning now be! There are few or
none of the inferiour Clergy, but might have in inferiour Callings arrived at
greater Incomes and with less charge of Education, and the most envied of
our dignified Clergy might in the other two of the great professions, viz.
in Law and Physick raised their Estates and Families on better and easier
terms then they now can.
And that the Men of the most eminent natural parts would be losers by
Religion, I mean by the Clerical Profession but for the encouragement of
these Dignities, we have an indication from the quality of the Divines in
the late times, who were generally so unlearned, that Learning it self then
seemed to have retreated from our Vniversities to the Colledge of Physiti|ans
in London. Notwithstanding the great Sums of Money by the Usurp'd
Powers employ'd in the Augmentations of Livings, one may well suppose
that all of the 10000 Livings in England except 600 needed, for that was
the number of the Livings in England as beforesaid averr'd to have afford|ed
a Competent maintenance for a Minister, the dearth of Learning and
Learned Men still continued, insomuch that the teeming press then brought
forth few Learned Discourses, relating to the faculty of Theology but what
was published by Dr. Hammond, Dr. Taylor, Dr. Sanderson and some other

Divines born and bred in the Sunshine of the Church of Eng|land.
And I do believe that in Holland the Livelihoods for their Parochial Di|vines,
are better then those that our Livings at a Medium yield, especially con|sidering
that the Dutch Ministers Widdows have 40 l. a year paid them du|ring
their Viduity: but for want of such encouragement as our Dignities
afford for the Educating their Natives in Learning, they are constrained
as Mr. Philip Nye observes in his Book called Beams of former light, p. 152.
To send to Forraign Parts to men to be their Professors, in their Acade|mies.
And I account that nothing less then the hopes of being Dignitaries,
could in the flourishing condition of the Church of England make so many
of our Learned Divines take up with the poor generality of our Livings,
which are such that the Answer to the Abstract published by Authority in
the Year 1588, mentions in p. 27, That surely if a Survey were taken of
all Parish Churches and Parochial Chappels in England, I dare affirm that it
would fall out that there be double or treble as many more Livings allotted for
Ministers under the true value of 30 l. a year, ultra omnia onera  reprisas,
as are above that Rate. And that our Divines in the late Times look'd on
such a yearly Sum as an uncomfortable pittance for a Minister, we have
an instance in the Story told in a History of the late Times in Print, where
a Patron desiring one to recommend to him a godly man for a Living of 50 l.
a year he then had void, was answered, That a godly man could not be had to
accept of a Living of so small a value.
It is moreover a lamentable thing to consider what an Excisum hath
been put on the value, even of our poor Livings, by the Simoniacal Pra|ctices
of Lay-Patrons: and in their hands the greatest part of the Impro|priations
hath been computed to be.
Sir Benjamin Rudyard a Famous Parliament-man of the last Age, in a
Speech of his in behalf of the Clergy, spoke in Parliament and Printed at
Oxford, Anno 1628, speaks there of the Scandalous Livings we have of 5 l.
and 5 Mark a year, and Cites Bishop Iewel for complaining in a Sermon
before Queen Elizabeth, That the Simony of our Lay-Patrons, was general
throughout England, and that a Gentleman cannot keep his House unless he
have a Parsonage or two in farm for his Provision.
And how generally a Simoniacal disposition hath continued to infect our
Gentry, appears by the vile Bonds that have been so much by Lay-Patrons
imposed on the Ministers they presented, viz. to resign their Livings again
to them at pleasure; and it is for the lasting Glory of the Lord Chancellor,
that he hath in Court declared that he will on occasion Null all Bonds of
that sort, and no doubt but the accidental encrease of the poverty of the
Gentry, which hath tempted them to sell the same Land twice, and to
sell the same Living once, will tend to the encrease of Simony.
Moreover when it shall be considered, that the Case of a Minister is such,
that tho Lay-men are secured by the Great Charter from being punished for
Contempt of the King's Commands, otherwise then with the saving of
their Contenement and Free-hold, yet that he holding Virtute Officii is lyable
by the Kings Ecclesiastical Laws, even for those things that in the Layety
are no offences to be deprived of the Free-hold, that the Law supposed him
as Parson or Vicar to possess, and that he by the Artifice of the said Bonds,
hath had the benefit of his Free-hold, in effect during the Patrons leepla|citum:
and further, that every New Political Conjuncture threatens him
with New Subscriptions from the Magistrate, and New Nic-names from
the Mobile, and that on any change of Religion, he is sure to be put in the

forlorn hope, and that he tho continually thinking of Divinity, which is
his profession, hath not yet that freedom to speak all his Sentiments of the
controverted part of it, which a Lay-man enjoys, and that he is still expo|sed
by constant thinking to prey on the Membranes of his own Brain to find
Notions for sensless people, methinks after he has all his life before, been
constrain'd to take these bitter Pills as they are in themselves, none should
repine at their being gilded for him in his declining age: and if among
Ten thousand of these, twenty six shall in their old Age have the Revenue of
Bishops, and five hundred of Prebends after so many shall have drawn
Blanks in the Lottery of Preferment, those few that shall draw those Prizes,
need not be envyed for what they have acquired by the Theological Pro|fession.
It was both with Justice and Prudence by our Laws caution'd that so great
a part of the Clerical Maintenance should arise from Tithes, for by that
means our Clergy are engaged to make the interest of their Country and
its improvement their own; and had they not had so much of their main|tenance
sounded on Tithes, but on Money out of the Exchequer, as they
had before this time lost excessively by Religion, so Religion would have
lost their Calling: for that the price of Silver falling by the plenty of it,
and the plenty or encrease of our people making all the Products of our
Country dearer, it hath been advantageous to our Clergy to receive their
Tithes in kind, as it hath been to Colleges to receive a Quota of their Rent
in Corn.
But that still the maintenance of the inferior Clergy, was too mean, will
appear even by the late Enemies of our Hierarchy being Judges, for Mr.
Nye in that Book of his, called Beams of former Light, having spoke of the
Ministers Calling, being once a gainful one, saith p. 123. It is vtterly other|wise
now, not but that there is a very liberal Maintenance appertaining to Mi|nisters
and greater by the bounty of the Honourable Parliament, then the
Preaching Ministry have formerly enjoyed.
The gradual encrease of our People and Trade, hath proportionably
encreased the Clerical Revenue which on the beginning of the Reformation
was presently sunk, so that Latimer in his Sermon before Edward the 6th
said, We of the Clergy have had too much, but that is taken away, and now we
have too little; and what Iewel in his Sermon notified to Queen Elizabeth of
that kind, I have mention'd, and so languid was the State of the maintenance
of the Inferior Clergy in her time, that She by one of her Printed Ecclesiastical
Injunctions, Anno 1599. did under great Penalties, forbid all Priests and
Deacons to Marry any Woman without the Advice and Allowance first had by
the Bishop of the Diocess and two Iustices of Peace, which I suppose was
caution'd by the Queen, that the many Ministers who had not competent
Livings to maintain themselves, might not marrying Wives without Dow|ries,
by new Births, encrease the number of Paupers in Parishes.
It is observable, that in the late times the Iesuites did publish many Pamph|lets
in Print against Tithes, and did animate the people to make Tumul|tuary
Addresses to the Usurpers to abolish that maintenance of the Mini|sters,
wherein as their Politicks were so unjust to our Monarch, that had
they succeeded, they would have barricaded the way for his return in the
minds of too many of the People for fear that the payment of Tithes should
return too, so likewise were they so ridiculous by cutting off all hopes of
the return of Popery here in any Conjuncture of time, that less then an
Army of Bellarmines would never have perswaded the common People to
hear with patience any talk of Holy Church's re-establishment here.

Tho, as I have shewn, that Tithes by reason of the equality in the Im|position
of them, and the diuturnity of time that hath habituated People
to the payment thereof, are a gentle part of the Yoke of our Ecclesiastical
Government, yet if the payment of them or any other Tax, whether of
Excise, Customs, or Chimny-money were for many years discontinued, there
would be no probability of bringing either the old Stagers or new Comers
in the World to consent or hearken to their being re-established.
The Critical Observers of the Iewish State, after Ten Tribes had made a
Schism from the other two, judge that there were two Conjunctures of time,
wherein their piecing together was fesable, and that the great true Cause in
Nature that hindred the Re-union of the Tribes, was the aversion in the
Ten Tribes to make three chargeable Journeys yearly to Ierusalem, and to
pay a double Tenth yearly out of their Estates (besides Offrings and other
Casualties to the Priests and Levites) from which trouble and charge they
had been relaxed by Ieroboam, and by his Model of Idolatry: and there|fore
the People having most inclination to that Religion that was cheapest,
and knowing that if they return'd to their old Religion, they must like|wise
return to their old Payments to the Priests and Levites, did venture
to adhere to the cheaper Golden Calf: and had the Iesuites here effected
from the Usurpt Powers the Abolition of the Clergies Tithes, which
would have made the Return of the Church of England so difficult, I may
well argue that it would have made the Return of the Papal Religion, and
its chargeable Idolatry impossible, whose Yoke of Payments neither we nor
our Forefathers were able to fear.
But when senseless anaticks came with those Petitions against Tithes,
the more sagacious of the Usurpers knew that the hand of Joab was in
them, and they knew that hardly any Observation was more trite then that
Popery gained ground, chiefly in the poorer parts of the Kingdom, where
the despicable maintenance made the Ministry so too, and where too the
Pope would no more hunt for Converts then among the poor Norwegians,
but that it was of use to him to have the number of his Subjects increas'd
in any poor places in a rich Kingdom, where he tho a spiritual King might
yet call his Subjects to Fight.
Sir Benjamin Rudyard takes notice of Popery's being an intruder among
the poor Benefices of the North, in the Speech before Cited, and there
saith, p. 1. That to plant good Ministers in good Livings, is the strongest
and surest means to establish true Religion, and will prevail more against Pa|pistry
then the making of new Laws, and executing the old, and there p. 3.
relates what King Iames had done for the supporting of the Protestant
Religion in Scotland, where (saith he) within the space of one year, he caused
to be Planted Churches throughout that Kingdom, the High-Lands and the
Borders worth 30 l. a year a piece, with a House and some glebe-Land belonging
to them, which 30 l. a year considering the cheapness of that Country is worth
double as much as any where within an 100 Miles of London. And p. 7.
he mentions some Passages of Bishop Iewels Sermon before Queen Eliza|beth,
where the Bishop having in general reflected on those that then cau|sed
the diminution of the maintenance of Ministers, he further saith,
howsoever they seem to rejoyce at the prosperity of Sion, and to seek the safety
and preservation of the Lords Anointed, yet needs must it be that by these
means Forraign Power, of which this Realm by the mercy of God is happily
delivered, shall again be brought in upon us. Such things shall be done to
us as we before suffer'd in the times of Popery, c.
'Twas there before mention'd how that Man of God with a flame of
Zeal, reflected in these words on the Queen her self, Our posterities shall rue

that ever such Fathers went before them, and Chronicles shall report this Con|tempt
of learning among the Plagues and Murrains and other Punishments of
God; they shall leave it written in what time, and under whose reign this was
done.
If the good Bishop had considered the vastness of Queen Elizabeth's Ex|pences
before mention'd, in desending the Protestant Cause, contra gentes, he
would have given her day to have built and endowed some Churches; and
to those expences before mention'd, it comes into my memory here to add
what I then forgot, which is related in the Travels of Mr. Fines Moryson,
who was Secretary then to the Chief Governor of Ireland in her Reign, viz.
That she expended in 4 years time on that Kingdom, a Million and one Hun|dred
Ninety Eight Thousand Pound Sterling; which Sum so laid out then
on Ireland, will seem the more considerable, when by a late Report of the
Counsel of Trade in that Kingdom drawn by Sir W. P. The currant Cash of
that Kingdom is made to be but Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand Pound
Sterling.
But this by the way, and to resume my discourse of our Clergies neither
getting nor losing by Religion; I shall say that as the acceptable free resto|ration
of the Church as well as the Crown to its Lands, shewed that there
was no fear of its injuring the Ballance of the Kingdom, or hurting Reli|gion
by its weight, so hath the following acquiescence of all dis-interested
men in the same, evinced that weight to be no gravamen.
In a Pamphlet called a Letter from a Person of Quality to his Friend in the
Country, Printed in the Year 1675, generally supposed to be writ by the
Earl of Shaftsbury, and which asserts the Justice of the Declaration of
Indulgence, the Author in p. 5. speaking of the Church of England, beco|ming
the head of the Protestants at home and abroad, saith, For that place
is due to the Church of England being in favour and of nearest approach to the
most powerful Prince of that Religion, and so always had it in their hands to be
the Intercessors and Procurers of the greatest good and protection that Party
throughout all Christendom can receive. And thus the Archbishop of Canter|bury
might become not only alterius orbis, but alterius Religionis Papa, and
all this Addition of Honour and Power attain'd without the least loss or dimi|nution
of the Church: it not being intended that one Dignity or Preferment
should be given to any, but those that were strictly conformable.
The natural inclination in all ingenious Men not to cast an evil Eye on
the Church Revenue, appears in Mr. Marvel's Second Part of the Reher|sal
transpos'd, p. 146. where he saith, I am so far from thinking enviously of
the Revenue of the Church of England, c. That I think in my Conscience
it is all but too little, and wish with all my heart that there could be some way
found out to augment it.
And our ingenious and great Lord Chancellor Bacon, in his certain Con|siderations
touching the pacification of the Church of England, hath with great
equity decreed our Parliaments to be in some sort indebted to the Church.
Moreover that Gentlemanly way of writing used by our great Divines,
in a late Conjuncture against Popery, and so suitable to the refinement of
Wit and Reason in the Age, and wherein without the Pedantry of unneces|sary
Words or Quotations, or raising a dust out of the Learned Rubbish
of the Schoolmen, they generally with a manly Style and clear reason and
skill at that weapon got the Sword out of their Enemies hand by the
Argumentum ad hominem, and shewed us that Popery and Implicit Faith
were not Calculated for the Meridian of this Age, hath (I think) made
all ingenious Men Conformists in this opinion, that if their Genius had been
cramp'd with the res angust a domi, their thoughts had not in their Books

appeared so great, and therefore I hope that all the well writ works of their
hands, and seasonable discourses against Popery at that time when it was ready
to curse us, and to rise up against our Religion, will make all thinking Prote|stants
to say Amen to that Prayer of Moses, Bless O Lord Levi's substance,
accept the work of his hands: smite through the Loyns of them that hate him,
that they rise not again.
It will I doubt not appear to rational and thinking men, that our little
interloping Churches or Congregations that set up with their precarious
Power, and small stock of Learning or Revenue, will no more be able to
break the great Compacted Body of the Papal Church, that hath the Mo|nopoly
of the Religion-Trade in so many parts of the World, then a few in|terloping
Merchant-men to break the Opulent Dutch East-India Company,
who have engross'd so much of the Spices of the World, that sometimes
they cause several Ships loadings of them to be at once consumed, as
knowing what quantity, and no more will be useful to the World. And
somewhat like that thing too, the Polity of the Anglican Church in
Harry the 8th's time perform'd while it drove a Religion-Trade with Rome,
and yet consumed a great quantity of its superfluous Merchandize, and the
same thing hath been done by our National Church, as to remaining parts
of the Romish Superstition in succeeding times, and indeed Superstition
which is a kind of Nimiety of Religion, is so incident to Humane Na|ture,
and is so destructive to the Polity of Churches, and the substantial
Commerce of Nations, that it is worthy the Power and Care of Nations
to consume it.
And considering that the Church of Rome hath still valued it self for
being terribilis sicut castrorum acies ordinata, it is a vain thing to contend
with such a Regular Church Militant, without our having of general Officers,
and as exact a Conduct, or to think to have such Officers without Ho|nourable
Maintenance from the Publick: For none doth go a Warfare at
any time at his own charge.
When I think how in the Primitive times, while a Cloud of Persecu|tion
was always over the head of the Christians, that yet they strain'd
themselves so much in Contributions for the Pastorage of their Souls,
that all the Pastors then were so far from losing by Religion, that some
were tempted to that Office for filthy Lucre (as we may see out of Peter
Ep. 1. Ch 5. Vers. 2.) tho yet too so little comparatively was to be gain'd
by all thereby, that others probably undertook that Office by constraint,
as the same place intimates, and that therein the Apostolick Prudence was
conspicuous in ordering it upon the whole matter, that the generality of Pa|stors
then should not get or lose by Religion, I may reasonably conclude that
we who live in the flourishing and prosperous State of Christianity, ought
to provide that the meanest Pastor of Souls in England, may live compe|tently
and decently by that Office: and for my part I shall never give my
voice for any ones serving in Parliament, that will not be willing to move
for the discharge of the Debt to the Clergy before mention'd, as soon as
the State of the Kingdom will bear it.
Sir Benjamin Rudyard in his aforesaid Speech p. 3. mentioning the dan|ger
we are in of being upbraided by the Papists, for being willing to serve
God with somewhat that would cost us nothing, hath a saying that I have
often heard Cited in discourse as anothers; namely, He that thinks to save
any thing by Religion, but his Soul, will be a loser in the end.
And this Notion of his of not saving by Religion, doth fortifie my affir|mation
of the publick inconvenience accruing by the getting by it, as to
which I have so opened the present State of the Clergies maintenance in
England, as to represent them rather losers then gainers.

When 'tis considered how many there are in England of the Layety,
who gape for gain by Religion, and are ready to devour one another for
it, as well as Religion by it, I am sure none can with reason think the
Quota of the Clergy's Maintenance, should be such as in the time of the
prosperity of the State to render them losers.
How scandalous and how ridiculous, nay, how ridiculous by Poverty
it self, many of our Lay-Popish and Protestant Religion-Traders have been,
I have already evinced; and do suppose that nothing can blacken that Trade
in the fancies of the People, more then the discovery of the Traders, who
must needs appear more odious then they who are the Mercenary Brokers,
for the debasing of Humane Nature by Lust, since the Hypocritical Reli|gion-Traders
do for Rewards prostitute the Honour of their Creator, and
as much as they can make the Divine Nature subservient to the diabolical
Art of their Hypocrisy.
Before the late Market for Converts in France, I have not heard or read
of any Nation in the World, wherein great Parcels of the Layety have
gain'd Mony by Religion, but only in England.
I believe that in Amsterdam (whereas Des Cartes saith in one of his
Epistles, Nemo non mercaturam exercet) there is not one Religion-Trader,
tho yet all Religions are there tolerated. Nor yet is any Lay-man of that
Trade in Paris who is of any other.
And in the Policy of the Turkish Empire, 'tis provided for as a Funda|mental,
that nothing shall be there acquired by Religion; insomuch that
all that Emperor's Subjects as well as himself being by their Law enjoyn'd
to be able to practice some Manual Trade, when any are call'd out to dis|charge
the Office of Priests, or Celebraters of the Publick Religious Wor|ship
there, such exact Care is taken, that they shall get by the exercise of
that Office, just so much and no more, as they did by their Manual Trade:
for which purpose, an Excellent Person who was the King's Ambassador at
Constantinople, related to me, That he complaining to the Visier of some
injury done by a Turkish Priest to one of his Servants, the Visier deprived
him of that Holy Employment, and that the Priest being afterward sent
to Petition to be restored to his place, he answered, that he would not,
being as well content to work on in the Mechanick Trade, to the exercise
whereof he was returned since his said deprivation.
But this Trade and sort of Traders that hath so long pester'd our King|dom,
is now about to expire and dye a natural death, and which it could not
before be brought to do by a violent. And as the Trade of sturdy Beggars,
the which is as much a Trade and as much conducted by Laws among
themselves, as is any incorporate one that hath the stamp of the Great
Seal, could by no Legislation be extinguished, but would soon be so by
peoples voluntary forbearing to be their Contributers, thus too will this
sturdy Religion-Trade have its Period. Our Fifth Monarchy-men who
thought to inherit the earth without giving sixteen years Purchase for it,
and who pretended to follow the Lamb wheresoever he went but really out
of dreams of a golden Fleece, are by all exploded. The condition of Britannia
languens, and that too very much occasion'd by the former insolence of the
Papists, being understood at Rome, will make the old Gentleman there think
'tis vain for him to hope to be possess'd of the Abby Lands without giving
for them many Millions of Pounds Sterling, and the Papists here will I be|lieve
so soon penetrate into the present State of our Poverty, that they will
find no way effectual for the delivering them from the vexatious Prosecuti|ons
of Protestant Informers, but the Removal of that decay of Trade,
and general dearth of many that has necessitated so many to be Informers,

and who cause them to spend upon under Sheriffs more Money then they
save by not being high Sheriffs, and which decay of Trade hath sunk a 4th
part of the value of their Lands, and which can never be cured but by the
dissolution of the Religionary one; and finding the Credit of the Iesuites
Society crack'd, as I have before express'd, will find that their Iourneymen
Calumniators (as Mr. Sergeant calls them in a Paper of his I have seen)
must necessarily break too, and it being found that not only our Enthusiasts
are forced by necessity of Nature to desist from expecting any gain by Reli|gion,
but all Protestants whatsoever, the Popish Traders therein will be
the more content to give over one of their Trades, and the fare of them will
be like that of the Associated Jesuites, to march out of their Spiritual
Corporations insensibly, like the captious Scribes and Pharises in the Gospel,
of whom 'tis there said, Being convicted in their own Consciences, they went
out one by one beginning at the eldest even to the last, c.
Tho as I said no man in Holland doth get or lose by Religion, yet since
the Reformation there was a Controvery of Religion, I mean the Armi|minin
one which made an extraordinary fermentation in their State, and
which Controversy tho Knaves there frighted Fools with, as if it were stir|red
by the Remonstrants, with an intent to bring in Popery; yet the
knowing few easily understood that neither side of the Question could pro|duce
that effect, and they likewise understood that the profession of the
belief of the several opposite Points of that Controversie among the op|posite
Parties there, serv'd only as Ribbands of several colours, to distinguish
Parties that are against each other in Arms.
And yet that very great Controversie in Religion, which divided Holland
and distracted our Kingdom in the time of the Royal Martyr, and the sub|stance
of which perplexed the Trihaeresia of the Iews, the Saduces, Essenes
and Pharises, and likewise three sorts of Christians, the Pelogians, Calvi|nists
and Arminians, and that of old divided the Sects of the Philosophers,
and hath many years raged among the Turks, and likewise among the Ie|suites
and Dominicans, after its having for so many thousand years troubled
so many Millions of Mankind, seems lately to be retired to its Eternal
Rest, and the sullen World seems resolved to hear and read no more of it,
and none I believe will get or lose any secular profit by his Sentiments in
that Controversie; and 'tis probable that the Controvertible part of Pope|ry
may thus go silently out of the Company of People in this Kingdom,
and without so much as troubling us by taking a formal leave, give rest to
it self and us, and that none will in this our World get or lose by that part
of Popery that can properly claim to be call'd a Religion.
I have usually in this Discourse called it an Hypothesis or Supposition,
which I chose rather to do then to call the entire Body of it a Religion, which
I know that it is not and cannot be, and that Popery and the former Scotch
Presbytery, and Socinianism are not in the gross called Religions otherwise
then .
I will not quarrel with Papists for calling some Points before mentioned,
wherein Disputants will be still playing with the Dye of Controversie, by
the Name of Religion, and I will give tho not grant them my Consent for
applying that Name, to the believing that the Pope is the Principium Vni|tatis,
and there are not many Propositions in the Chronologia haeresium,
sectarum  schismatum, and in the Haeresiographis that many have Publish'd,
that I would think a man to have laesa principia that did call Tenets of
Religion; and there are in Popery many things enjoyn'd, that tho I look
on as needless impositions and new inventions, for the diverting the Me|lancholy,
I shall not gainsay any one that shall call Religion and represent

them as of Apostolical Practice, tho the birth of many of them was rever
but of yesterday.
And thus let the mixing of Water with Wine in the Euchaist, and the
fasting on Friday, Pilgrimages to the Sepulchres of Martyrs, the Priests
using a low voice in Consecration, and let the Canonization of Saints,
the institution of Saturday Mass in honour of the Virgin Mary, the in|vention
of the Red Hatts and Scarlet Cloaks worn by Cardinals, the
Institution of the year of Jubily, the Popes every year Consecrating a Rose
of Gold, the sound of the Bell at the hour of Mid day, the Rosary of the
Virgin Mary, and likewise the Baptization of Bells, be all baptised
with the name of Religion, and many Notions and Practices likewise more
peculiar to Popery.
And tho the denomination of things is from the better part, as Mines
are said to be of Lead, or Silver, c. from the quantity of the Metal there
most valuable, and so I can be content to call a Complication of Tenets
of which some are erroneous by the name of a Religion, yet in any Systeme
of Religion or Confession, that may happen to appear in the World more pure
and exact then the Augustane, or the Helvetian, or the Saxonic, the Gallic,
or English, or Belgic, or Bohemian, and more accommodate to the true
sense of the Councils and Fathers, and the best Expositors then the former,
and containing more satisfactory explanations about the propagation and en|trance
of Original Sin, the Nature, Order and Offices of Angels, and of
the Consistency both of Gods immutable Decrces, with the Contingency
of second Causes, and of the Efficacy of God's Grace, with the freedom
of Mans Will, and of the Time, Place and Antecedents of the last Judg|ment,
one single Notion relating but to a Commandment of the second
Table, incorporated with such a Confession of Faith, would make the apply|ing
the Name of Religion to the whole to be very ridiculous and nauseous,
and make it more fit in the gross to be called a Confession of Faction, or of
Conspiracy against Mankind; and any one will think so if that one Article
should be thus inserted, And we further think it commendable at some Seasons
of the year, to kill the next man we shall meet. And yet as harshly as this
sounds, there is that in Popery and likewise in the Doctrine of the Resistance
of Princes contrary to the Municipal Laws, that doth hear worse, and that
is tho not ajustification of the killing the next man to be met with, the ef|fect
of which would yet make men excite their natural Courage and fortifie
it with skill, and be provided with good Arms, whereby to be always ready
to defend their Country (just as the Spartan Law of punishing no man
for Theft that was not taken in the Fact, made men more vigilant in the
Custody of their Goods) namely, the killing Multitudes of the best men
that can be culled and singled out of the faex of Mankind, and such of
whom the World is not worthy, in so much that we are told by Alsted in
his Chronologia testium veritatis, that ab Anno 1540, usque ad Annum 1580,
Novies centena millia Christianorum in Blgio, Gallia, Anglia, Italia  His|pania,
Religionis Causa trucidata sunt: atque inter eos fuerunt, 235 Barones,
148 Comites, 39 Principes, and the killing of Ten thousand Subjects next
met, would not be so destructive to Kingdoms as the killing of one King,
for according to the computation and the Style of the Scripture, he is worth
Ten Thousand of us.
My Lord Arch-bishop Laud in his Famous Speech in the Star-Chamber p.
32, 33, c. Answers some Mens Charge of Innovation against our Liturgy,
as to the Prayers set forth for the 5th of November, and ordered (they
say) to be read by Act of Parliament where one passage was, Cut off
those workers of Iniquity, whose Religion is Rebellion; and in the Book

Printed 1635. 'tis thus alter'd, Cut off those workers who turn Religion into
Rebellion.
His Grace in the p. 36. there weighs the Consequences of avowing
that the Popish Religion is Rebellion: and in the next p. saith, That if you
make their Religion to be Rebellion, then you make their Religion and their
Rebellion to be all one.
But in my poor opinion several of the great Points of their Religion
so called, as even transubstantiation it self and many others, are not to be
term'd Rebellion, but other points before mentioned can properly be term'd
nothing else, and when all those Tenets are so complicated by them, that they
do all conjoyntly integrate their Religion, then is there pretended Reli|gion,
when really believed, and practised, a real Rebellion.
The best advice therefore that I can give to a Papist is that of the old
Philosopher , simplifica te ipsum, and that of a Iewish Rabbi, Come|de
dactylos,  projice for as uritiem. The World is a weary of seeing any men
joyn what God and Nature have parted: and of their projecting a Commu|nion
between Christ and Belial, and making Christ the Minister of Sin, as the
Scripture expression is.
A great Master of Mechanics and of all sorts of refined Learning some
years since brought to light the Invention of the double bottom'd Vessel,
and a rude Description of it, being sent me for News into the Country, I
easily guessed that such a Ship bearing much more Sail then other Ships,
must needs go a great deal faster before the Wind; but I was not inform'd
of the Provision that the excellent Artist had made against the danger of
Divulsion; it being obvious that in some Tempests 'tis as much as one en|tire
body can do to preserve it self against the ury of the Sea.
This hath been the condition of Popery with its double bottom of Prin|ciples,
namely, to bear a great wide spreading Sail, and it has heretofore in
a quiet World sail'd apace before the Wind and in fair weather, but the Tem|pestuous
Debates its Principles have raised here and abroad in the Sea of the
People, have made this old double bottom'd Ship of St. Peter in such dan|ger
of Divulsion that especially with such Pauls Marriners as it employs, it
can hardly escape.
I doubt not but the Papists as well as others of Mankind, have a Right
and Title to the free and undisturb'd worshiping of God and the Confessi|on
of the Principles of Religion, purchased for them by the Blood of Christ:
for Religion being Mens Priviledge as well as Duty (just as the Romans did
account that they endowed any place with a Priviledge when they gave
them their Laws) they may thank their great Redeemer for being resto|red
to it. By the vertue of his Blood, the Papists stand seiz'd of a good
and indefeisable estate of Christian Liberty, and they are bought with a Price,
and are therefore not to be the Servants of Men, and one is their Master even
Christ, who is the Lord that bought them and they are therefore to stand fast in
the liberty wherewith Christ hath made them free.
Socinus saith, he went on his Knees to God to find out the meaning of the
58th V. of the 8th of St. Iohn. And should I chance to over hear any one
Member of Mankind at his Private Devotions, and importuning Heaven to
illuminate his mind with the knowledge of some point in Religion, that he con|ceived
necessary to his Salvation, and acknowledging it to the praise of the Di|vine
Goodness, that excited him to the use of all means whereby to discover it,
that he had so far through the Efficacy of assisting Grace practised the Truths,
his understanding was possest with as to satisfie his mind that he was a serious
Supplicant for its being the depositary of more, I should be so far from wish|ing
this man delivered over to Satan, from differing for me in any con|troverted

Point of Religion, that I should think that if the truth he was in
quest of; imported his Salvation, God would send an Angel to explain it to
him.
But as to one part of the double bottom of Popery, tho we should grant
it laden with fundamental truths, yet 'tis notorious that the other is over|laden
with Fundamental Errors, and such as are apt to undermine the Foun|dations
of States and Kingdoms, and there is no need of an extraordinary
Messenger from Heaven to tell one embarked therein, that the Pope is not
to absolve Subjects from the obedience of their Princes, nor to cause an eter|nal
fermentation and inquitude in the World, through his Kingdom, (that
should not be of it at all) yet being unbutted and unbounded by him in all
the parts of it.
I will likewise tell any Soeinian that his great Master Socinus made such
a double bottom of his Systeme of Notions, that it hath forfeited its right to the
Name of Religion by one Tenet complicated therewith, and that he ought
to throw that off and simplificare se ipsum. Let any one if he pleaseth call
the Socinians denying of the Trinity in Unity, and Original Sin, and the
Baptism of Infants, or the Divine Prescience, and many other of their No|tions
by the Name of Religion; but there is own of their Tenets that their
Master needed no long wrestling with Heaven as a Supplicant to find out
the truth of, and which Notion when really believed is as pernicious to
Crown'd Heads and their Subjects, as the lawfulness of any ones sometime
killing the next man he meets, and that is, that my Prince and I may not
defend our lives against the next Invader who comes to take them away;
for as to that great Question, An bellum offensivum vel defensivum fit licitum,
the Socinians answer is negatur, which any one may see who pleaseth to
consult the Themata F. Socini de officio Christi p. 7. Inter breves tractatus F.
Socini: and likewise his Epistle to Christopher Morstias, p. 498. among his
Epistles.
And thus let the well-willers to Presbytery, call that erroneous opinion
of their Church Government being founded on that Divine Right, and the
immediate Command of Christ and his Apostles a Tenet of Religion, but
to confront the Laws of Kingdoms in the settling it, and to eradicate any
part of those, and especially to root the inheritable Monarchs Power in po|pular
Election or Approbation, and to make him but the Peoples Attorny,
and his Authority as revocable by them as a Letter of Attorney, is abusively
call'd Religion, and is only properly to be term'd Sedition, or Rebel|lion.
I have been so copious in insisting on the necessary separation of all Te|nets
that are denominable as Religious, from those that are really Irreligious
and Seditious under the gross name of the Religion in any Party, as a thing
perfectly just in it self, and necessary for the quiet of the World, and do
hope that the Age that is so much addicted here to the improvement and
polishing of our Language, will incline it to do it self that right as not to
give false Names to Things, and Names of a contrary significa|tion.
We know that the Standard of England in the Mint refers both to
weight and fineness; and tho a piece of Money may have the Royal Stamp
on it, engraven with all possible curiosity, yet if it be not standard, 'tis so
far from being allow'd the Name of any Species of the Kings Coyn, that 'tis in|stantly
to be broken in pieces; and as this is but just so is it but necessary for
the quiet of the People, who else detecting it would suspect the whole cre|dit
of the Mint, as well as of that Species of Money, and would either not
take it or else with a Clamour raise the price of their Commodities for it.

And thus it is too a thing unreasonable and troublesome to the World, for
Men to Coyn false words or false denominations for any Tenet in Religion in|trinsecally
defective, what curious stamp of the artifice of any Party soever
it may bear: its reprobate Silver is not to be call'd Religion, and it makes
Religion it self lyable to suspicion among the inquisitive, it will trouble
every hand it passeth to and from, and in giving a value to it, the People
will raise the price of their tolerating it, and the World will never be quiet
till its allay from the true Silver be separated by melting it down, and it
takes the name of Religion only when it deserves it.
What is more ordinary then for Clamour to raise this question, Will you
punish any man for his Religion? and will you have any man lose by his Reli|gion?
and I see no end in the disputes of the question but by this Answer,
and by this it must find a Period, viz. I punish no man for his Religion, for that
Tenet that I quarrel with him about, is not and indeed cannot be Religion.
It is pure and rank Sedition and Rebellion; and if any Papist or Presbyterian
shall write or speak to make the Kings Power a bubble blown up by the
breath of the People and so dissolvable, I shall esteem him fit to be proceeded
against by the new Statute of the 13th of this Kings Reign against Sedition,
and as a Subverter of the Fundamental Laws, and do suppose 'twill be ridicu|lous
for any one to plead his Religion in bar of that Indictment, and he doth
moreover deserve to be punish'd as a Cheater for abusing the World and
himself and Religion too, by calling such a particular Tenet Religion, or a
Complication of many Tenets by that Name, where the vertue of them all is
not strong enough to correct the Poyson of one.
The Scripture doth punish those with a denunciation of a Wo who call
evil good, and good evil, that put darkness for light, and light for darkness;
and in this particular Point of the calling any of the Idolatries or Impo|stures
of the Heathens or others, by the name of Religion, I remember
not any instance in holy Writ, tho yet in other Cases 'tis not infrequent for
the inspired Pen man to speak cum vulgo.
I observe that in the New Testament the name of Religion is several times
applyed to the Iewish after the World was freed from the Obligation of it:
but one of the holy Pen-men speaking in one Chapter of false Apostles,
useth the Style of hating the Deeds of the Nicolaitans, and of holding the
Doctrine of the Nicolaitans, and of holding the Doctrines of Balam: And ano|ther
of the Amanuenses of the Holy-Ghost speaks of Doctrines of Devils.
If any man shall offer to my consideration a Scheme of Doctrines that
relate to Theology, and I find it is too subtle for my understanding to pe|netrate,
I shall yet be so evil as to allow the Propounder to call it a Religion:
and thus if Papists or Protestants would agree to call Dr. Gibbon's Scheme,
a Religion or demonstration of it, I would not oppose theit calling it any such
thing; and the rather since it enjoyns not to me any thing that would
break my own or the Worlds quiet; but when Popery doth enjoyn so many
Tenets to be believed that are incredible to a rational Man, and some things
that are clearly impossible to a Moral Man, I will call Popery in the gross
any thing rather then Religion, just as Tully saith of those Law-givers who
did perniciosa  injusta a populis praescribere, that they did quidvis potius ferre
quam leges.
I find not that since the year 1605. Popery hath so discriminated it self by
any alteration for the beter, as to overthrow the weight of King Iames's
saying then to both his Houses of Parliament, viz. That as it is not impossi|ble
but many honest men seduced with some Erors in Popery, may yet remain
good and faithful Subjects, so on the other hand, none that know and believe the
grounds and School conclusions of their Doctrine, can ever prove good Christians
or faithful Subjects.

There is one Tenet in the Doctrine of Popery that your Lordship shewed
me once discust in Print by a Canonist, and by whom I was directed to
trace it, both to the Gloss and Text in the Canon Law, that I having dis|cours'd
of, to a Pious and Learned Neighbour of mine, who is a Roman Ca|tholick,
he obliged me to write to your Lordship, that you would please to
let any of your Amanuenses transcribe, and to send hither to me the Reso|lution
of that Lawyer, and determination of the Pope in his Law about it,
and hath declared to me, that he will joyn issue with me in the Plea about
Religion, in that being a Tenet or Principle approved by the Church of
Rome; and your habitual inclination to afford any one, tho a stranger to
you, lumen de lumine, will (I doubt not) make it easie to you to gratifie
my request in his behalf.
He grants to me that if that Tenet can be shewn to be one approved by
the Church of Rome, that he believes there will be no occasion for disputants
any more to attaque the Roman Catholick Religion, and that as an Indepen|dant
Author in the late times writing a Pamphlet against Presbytery, had
this Title for it, An end of one Controversy, it might be supposed that a
Sheet of Paper that without strain'd Inferences could fasten that Tenet on
the Doctrine of Popery, would with better success make an end of that
Controversy.
My Lord this Point discussed in Print, that I refer to, is as I find it in the
Notes I took thereof in your Lordships Study, in Gundissalvus his Tra|ctatus
de Haereticis, Question. 24. before which the Summarium is thus,

1. Civitas in qu aliqui insunt haeretici an tota possit igne exuri, aut alias
destrui.
2. Civitas quando dicatur haeresim committere, ut universa destrui
possit.
3. Vniversitate punit de haeresi an singuli quque puniti videantur, ita ut
amplius puniri non possint.

The Gentleman being of a nice tenderness of Conscience, and having a
quick sense of any thing that looks like gross impiety, was at the very
nameing of the first and second Question, surprized with a kind of trembling,
and was somewhat more discomposed, when I told him that upon considera|tion
of the whole matter, it appear'd even from the most moderate of the
Canonists that a whole City might lawfully be destroyed with Fire, if the
Majority of it were Hereticks, and that there were the Judgment of
the Church in the Case; and like a Man of a large and candid Soul, he
said, that he was sorry that Humane Nature could in any men so far de|generate,
as to deliberate about such their destroying a whole City by Fire,
but would reserve his judgment on the Point till he saw it before him in
the Quotations out of the Canon-Law, as well as Canonists. What the
Event of his Judgment will be I know not; and I confess I have been very
sparing of my time in discoursing with Roman Catholicks, about any
Point of the Doctrine of their Church, since I read it in Cardinal Tolets Inst.
sacerdotum lib. 4. cap. 3. and 7. p. 612. and in our Countryman Holcot a Fa|mous
Schoolman in lib. 1. Sententiarum Quest. 1. ad sextum principale in re|plica.
That if he hears his Prelate Preaching an erroneous Proposition
which he doth not know to be so, and believes him, he doth not sin, but is
bound to err because he is bound to believe him,  meretur volendo credere
errorem.
And he who believes he shall merit by going out of his way, I am sure
deserves, that I should not much trouble my self to go out of mine, to put him
in the right.

But this is not the temper of this Worthy Gentleman, whom I have reason
to esteem a lover of truth quatenus truth, and for its own sake, and one
who doth not account falshood charming, or rebelling against the Light me|ritorious:
and indeed I have observ'd it in some others, as well as him, that
after they have deserted the Church of England, their inquisitiveness in
Religion has not been at its Journeys end, but has still continued in its
way, and that so far, that Holy Church and they have oft been apt secretly
to be weary of one another.
The Rational Religion they were first educated in, has had the allure|ments
of the Natale solum, that they could never wholy overpower.
I have known three Earls, one whereof was of the Kingdom of Ireland,
and the other two of England, and all of them were men of great Wit
and Parts, and such who being brought up in the Religion of the Church
of England, went off from it to the Church of Rome: but receded not from
the candour of their tempers, nor from the Society of their old Friends,
nor from the frank readiness to discourse with them, about the controverted
Points of both Churches, and neither of them perverted their Wives or
Children to Popery, and the eldest Sons of them all, are eminent Sons
of the Church of England, and do make considerable figures in the
State.
One of those three Earls is yet living, and in him lives the great ex|ample
of an English Nobleman, adorning Nobility by his intellectual and
Moral Endowments, and by a Majesty mixt with incomparable sweetness
in his familiar Converse, and by a consummate Loyalty to his Prince that
Envy it self never spotted, and by such an exact Observation of his Faith,
given to any of Mankind, that he would no more violate it with an Here|tick,
then with a Patriarch or Apostle, and by having been never suspect|ed
from using any Iesuite-Confessors to learn how to evade from solid Ho|nour
by subtle distinctions, or once to allow the least Chicanery in God's
Great Court of Conscience.
And if we cast our thoughts on France, we shall there find that the great
and the brave Turen after he had so unfortunately thrown himself at the Popes
Feet, had there his Arms as ready to embrace his Protestant Friends as
ever.
I have heard of two Crown'd Heads of the Church of Rome, who were
very unkind to their Protestant Subjects after stipulations to the contrary:
the one was Ferdinand of Bohemia, who when Cardinal Cleselius Bishop
of Vienna told him, that if he made War on the Bohemians the destruction
of that flourishing Kingdom would certainly follow, answered, We would
rather have the Kingdom destroyed then damned; the other was Queen
Mary of England, who as the (Acts and Monuments tells us) being intent
on the Restoring the Abby-Lands, and discoursing with Four of her Privy-|Counsellors
about the same, said, perhaps you may object to me again, that the
State of my Kingdom, the Dignity thereof and my Crown Imperial, cannot be
honourably maintain'd without the Possessions aforesaid; yet notwithstanding I
set more by the Salvation of my Soul, then by Ten Kingdoms: and the Reign of
each of these was besmear'd with Blood: but had they been born and bred
Lambs, I believe that no Transmutation of the Blood of Tygres into them
would have made them such.
The Famous Iulian of whom 'twas said, Nunc Apostolicus, Nunc Vilis
Apostata factus, had learned too much Christianity, when he was a Reader,
to be a raging Blood-sucker; and if when Emperor he had had e're a Name|sake
that collected the Madrigals or Hymns against him, he would perhaps
have done him no harm.

The low birth and the Poverty and Mercenary disposition of Iudas,
tempted him to betray his Master with a kiss, but he was so far wrought
on by the good Company he had kept, that he afterwards kill'd none else
but himself: and they are such perverted Protestants generally that are of
the same rate with Iudas for Birth and Poverty, and paultry Avarice,
that I should desire to stand out of the way from and to avoid the Vermine
of such Renegadoes; and they are only such Popish Princes as Ferdinand
and Mary, that in their Education were never imbued with better Princi|ples
then the bloody ones of Popery, that I should fear as Monsters, and ac|count
any Kingdom but a Den, if I lived therein with them: and when ever
I happen to dispute about that Notion in vogue that Vertue it self in a Po|pish
Successor will be a Nusance, and make him a bloody Bigot, I answer
with a distinction and grant it is likely to be so in one who passed from the
Breast, in Infancy to suck in Sanguinary Principles, but where in any Suc|cessor,
the Tenets of Popery when he is on the Borders of old Age, are
Successors to Principles of a Noble and Rational Religion, that he has
grown up into youth and manhood with, I shall account my fears very
wild and irrational if my hopes do not grow up with them as to my promi|sing
my self, that he will at least answer Bocalines Character of the best
Reformer of the World, namely, one that leaves it as he finds it, and do sup|pose
the practicableness of what is Savage in Nature, being reclaim'd in one
Animal toward another it was educated with, will be allowed from the fre|quent
and trivial spectacle of the Lion and the Lamb that were bred up to|gether,
and who without the help of Miracle and Prophecy were taught by
Nature to lye down together, and shall account the same persons injurious
to the World, who fishing in troubled waters of the State, say, the worse
the better, and of such a Prince educated in Protestancy and then perhaps
turning Papist, the better the worse, and especially when the Laws have es|pous'd
us to his Line, for better for worse.
Our acute and profound Mr. Chillingworth in Mature years went over
to the Church of Rome, and in his course there made a short turn, and the
Natale solum of the Church of England charm'd him soon back again, and
he by the culture of his reason made the Soil a hundred fold amends for
his temporary deserting it. But Princes and Potentates are under higher
temptations then his low Station placed him in not to be seen to retreat,
especially after their having once done it before, and may suppose that
other Princes will look on them as more slippery and unsafe to be dealt
with, if the same Principles once congeal'd or hardened in them, and after|ward
dissolv'd should be congeal'd again, just as the Earth is more slippery
and unsafe to be walked on in a Frost after a Thaw.
We are told by the Conformist in the Friendly Debate, in p. 112. That he
has heard some of the Nonconformist Divines acknowledge, that they did not
scruple what the Conformists do: but thought it unhandsome for them to do it,
c. And the meaning was, in plain English, that they were ashamed to confess
their error.
But if some of those Divines whose low Education conducted them per|haps
from being Servitors in the University to domineer in their Cures, and
who through the Track of their Lives might be traced by the slime of their
Pedantry, and whose Trade was (or should have been) the Study of Di|vinity
(the Precepts of which and their fragments collected out of Au|gustinus
and Aquinas as well as the example of the former, obliged them
to retract those Errors publickly, that they had so utter'd) I say that if
they were yet so Picquez d' Honneur, that they would not let their fallibi|lity
appear in Villages, and even the falsity of those Principles of theirs, by

which as many Hundreds of Thousands here were slain as were bare hun|dreds
murder'd in the inglorious Reign of Queen Mary, they have true
Cause to think it dishonourable for them to restrain their Compassion from
any high born Prince, the brightness of whose great Martial Atchievements
has dazel'd the Universe, and will continue to do it when he is in the shades
below, and one who may say as the Pope did to the Iansenists that he had
never studyed Divinity, and they are very unfit to Cashiere him from the
Church Militant, if he doth not in the view of Mankind appear to
make a Retreat at the Call of their Trumpet, which has been known to give
so uncertain a sound; and such may be ashamed to dispair of his finding
out any false Notions, he may have received in Religion, and to conclude
that he hath not privately discovered them because he doth not openly re|cant
them, and to expect that after perhaps he hath erred in the Tenet
of Confession, he should yet presently make the World his Confessor about it,
and grant him nothing of the Guard of Honour in the Case, but Monopo|lize
the temptations from honour to their sinful obscure selves.
But as no man can take the measures of anothers Sins without taking
those of his temptations, so none but a Prince can know the temptations of
a Prince. Dic mihi si fueris tu Leo, c.
The like Pedantry therefore in the great St. Ierom was inexcusable as to
that sharp saying of his, Miror si aliquis Rex salvabitur: and that Satyrical
fancy of his hath since met with its Match by some that have sent St. Ie|rom
to the Devil as fantastically; for so I find it said in Dr. Donnes ,
After so many Ages of a Devout and Religious Celebrating the Memory of
St. Jerom, Causaeus hath spoken so dangerously, that (Ratio. 5.) Campian
says, he pronounceth him to be as deep in Hell as the Devil.
Moreover I think it great injustice to any Prince who has changed his Re|ligion
of Protestancy for Popery, that Protestants should at the same time
be jealous of his retaining no tincture of his former Principles, that the
Bigotted and Jesuited Papists are jealous of his scarce retaining a tincture
of his new ones, and by jealousie too, as cruel as the Grave, as appeared by
the fate of Harry the 4th, who because he did not and indeed could not
devest himself of that humanity toward his Protestant Subjects that was
riveted in his nature, after he was absolv'd by the Chair of Infalibility, and
reconciled to the very Scorners Chair of the Iesuites, yer merely because he
had not a window to his breast through which every capricious Priest
might look in at, and might thereby put in what Principles he pleased,
they were resolved to cut one there; and after Iohn Chastel had begun to
practice his incision, an execrable Apology for it was Published, in which
Apology Printed in Latin at Lyons Anno 1611. the Assertion or Head of Chap|ter
3d, Part 2d is, Chastel had no purpose to kill a King, and of Chapter
4th there, Henry of Burbon cannot be called a King by reason of his pretend|ed
Conversion: and of Chapter 8th there, Neither can he be King tho absol|ved
by the Pope, and of Chapter 9th, Neither can he be called a King by the
Right of Succession, and of Chapter 11th, Hereticks and especially relapsed
ones are Jue Divino  Humano to be put to death, and of Chapter 12th,
Hereticks and especially relapsed ones may be killed by private Persons, if it
cannot be done otherwise.
The Assassination of Harry the 3d of France bears with it a Memento
mori to any Roman Catholick Prince, who will not be thorow paed in obey|ing
the Precepts of Bigotted Priests against Hereticks, and to this effect
runs the Clamour of the Actions of such Bigots, either you must go our pace
to Heaven and Travel by our Mapp, see with our Eyes, and let us ride you
when we will, and make you ride over your Heretical Subjects, or we will pre|cipitate
you to the Devil.

I mention'd it before out of D' Ossat that it was known at Rome, that
Queen Anne the Wife to King Iames, had some inclination to the Roman Ca|tholick
Religion, and no doubt but she was perverted to it in some measure
by some of the Romish Priests who were then as since insolently over offi|cious
to tempt Princes to change their Faith: and tho none of our Histo|ries
mentions any thing of her being a Papist or inclining to be so, yet
D' Ossat (as I said) relates how Villeroy supposed her to have turn'd Papist:
but our Historians unanimously mention one thing, that she was designed
as well as the King and Prince and others to be blown up by the Gun-Pow|der-Treason,
a thing that may give one who turns Son of the Church of
Rome cause to say, Mallem esse Herodis porcum quam filium.
No doubt but the mind of any Popish Prince coming out of the cool and
sweet Air of a benign and rational Religion, to that of such a torrid Zone
and Shambles of mans flesh as the Doctrine of Popery presents, will be of|tener
in his thoughts travelling back to that Religion then the prying
World can know.
But the Gentleman my friend is not any way tempted in point of ho|nour
to delay his Return to the Church of England; and he lately men|tioning
to me his wishes of the speedy Arrival of your Lordships Papers,
told me, that possibly he and I should be both gainers thereby, and that I
should gain the Victory and he the Truth, and that he would never ac|count
those Priests of Rome to be the Missionaries of Christ, who if their
Doctrine be refused, shall instead of shaking off the dust of their feet in any
house, reduce it to Ashes; and further affirmed that it were less absurd and
extravagant to wish there were no Religion at all in the World, whether
reveal'd or natural, then that any such Hypothesis or Doctrine that Autho|rised
a Practice of that nature, should be universally receiv'd in it as its Re|ligion.
For tho natural Religion acquaints me with the Divine Power, and gives
me hopes of my Creators not rendring me miserable by that Power, and
the rather when I have seen that many of the Contemners of Heavens
Thunder lived prosperously on Earth, yet if a Model of Religion pretended
to be the only reveal'd one shall controuling all the Dictates of natural Re|ligion
enjoyn the firing of whole Cities, and mankinds confused outraging
one another, I must abandon my further hopes of Bliss from such a Being
as was it self miserable, for so that would be whose nature was still in a fer|mentation
of Anger and Passion, and rear'd up Men as the Workmanship of its
hands, only to dash those curious but brittle Vessels against one another, and
that even for such a Being 'twere more eligible to be, then to be always
so miserable, as well as 'twould prove so for my self too, then to be always in
Torment by Anger.
But we know that as God is the God of Order and not of Confusion, so he is
likewise an overflowing Fountain of Goodness, and so infinitely benign,
that if his Nature were rightly represented to an ingenious Atheist, if he did
not at last believe he would ardently wish there were a God: and I think
if there be any number of that degenerate sort of Mankind called Atheists,
(as was said) that such degeneracy must needs be chiefly caused by the
mis-representations of the Divine Being.
I have before mentioned how Tully in his de Natura Deorum shews great
Wit in his Anger against the Epicureans, for their representing the Deity as
unconcern'd for Mankind; and against the rendring God careless of the
welfare of his Creature man he there exclaims, Deinde si maxime talis est
Deus ut null grati, null hominum charitate teneatur, valeat.

How passionately then would he have upbraided any Mushroom Sect of
Philosophers, if such had sprung up in the World (as in his time and before
there never did) that had represented the Nature of the Deity as solicitous
and careful only of procuring the misery of Mankind and disorder of the
World, and enjoyning men to spit fire at one another, exposing them to
the sury of Wild Beasts if they lived in Desarts, and of wilder Creatures,
that is, themselves, if they lived in Cities.
There was an Ingenious and Learned and Pious Divine, I mean Cressy
who in our days forsook the Communion of the Church of England, and
turned Roman Catholick, and went beyond Sea, and returned to England
in the Conjuncture of the petulant Insolence, and was so far infected there|with,
and likewise with the Chagrin incident to sickness, that he writ very
peevishly against our Church, and one of our great Church Men; and his
Writings were justly censured by the Earl of Clarendon: but according to
my former Observation, so much of the Character of the rationality of
the Protestant Religion that he was long bred up in remain'd in him inde|libile,
that I believe had he been made an Inquisitor of Heretical Pravity,
he would neither have took away a drop of Blood from any Protestant,
nor a hair from his head; and in his Reply to that Noble Lord, he is so
candid as speaking of the Position charged on Roman Catholicks, that no
Salvation is to be had out of that Church, to affirm that all Catholicks
grant that this is not necessarily to be understood of an actual external Commu|nion,
and that many Christians of vertuous devout lifes, and having had a con|stant
preparation of mind to prefer truth whensoever effectually discovered to
them before all temporal advantages, they dying in this disposition tho not ex|ternally
joyned to the Church, will be esteem'd by our merciful Lord as true
Members of his Mystical Body the Church.
No Papist but one bred a Protestant, could have had thoughts so large
concerning the extent of the invisible Church, or fancy that what is before
mentioned, is granted by all Catholicks, and should I hear any Priest in a
Fryars Cowle grant what is abovesaid, I should fancy that he remain'd an
invisible Protestant, and that he continued so exuberantly good in his
natural disposition as not to be able to frame an Idea in his mind of the
damning of Mens Souls, and making Coals of their Bodies and Bonefires
of their Cities, for mistaken Sentiments in Religion: and had Mr. Cressy
lived till this time, 'tis possible your Lordship by your Notification of that
fiery Tenet of the Papal Church aforesaid, might have been an instrument
of his visible Return to our Church; for his labour'd heating himself
with Passion upon the mention of the Practice of that thing in his Church
History, shews sufficiently how he would have abhorr'd any Church that
abhorr'd not that Tenet.
The Place I refer to in his Church History is in the 14th Book, 4th Chapter,
where he doth strenuously endeavour to prove that Monk Austin was unjustly
Accused of having killed 1200 Brittish Monks: and having said there . 9th,
yet of late this poysonous humour of Calumniating God's Saints is become the
Principal Character of the New Reformed Gospel, he goes on thus, I will add
one example more of a Calumniator, to wit, Mr. William Prynn, a late stig|matised
Presbyterian, c. But alas what repentance can be expected in such a
person (speaking of Prynn) who is inveteratus malorum dierum, when we
see in his decrepit Age his rancorous Tongue against innocent Catholicks, yet
more violently set on Fire of Hell so far as to sollicit a general Messacre of them,
by publishing himself and tempting others to damn their Souls also by pub|lishing
through the whole Kingdom, that in the last Fatal Calamity by Fire
happening to London they were the only Incendiaries. This he did tho him|self

at the same time confessed that not the least proof could be produced against
them, but said he it concerns us that this Report should be believed. Com|plaints
of this most execrable Attentat were made, and several Oaths to Con|firm
this were offer'd, but in vain. But however surely there is a Reward for
the innocent oppress'd, and whatsoever Mr. Prynn may think, doubtless there
is a God that judgeth the World. Let him therefore remember what the Spi|rit
of God saith, quid detur tibi, aut quid apponatur tibi ad linguam dolo|sam
sagittae potentis acutae, cum carbonibus desolatoriis, is what must be gi|ven
to thee, and what must be assign'd to thee for thy Portion, O deceitful Tongue,
sharp Darts cast by an Almighty Arm with devouring Coals of uniper.
And it follows . 10. With as good reason therefore St. Austin may be Ac|cused
of the slaughter of those Brittish Monks as St. Columban, a holy Irish
Monk, c. might be charged with the most horrible death of Queen Brune|cheld,
c.
This good man certainly apprehended no reason of an additional Com|mandment,
Thou shalt not fire thy Neighbours house, and had he been con|vinced
that the Pope in his decrepit Age had made a Commandment for
the firing of it, and whole Cities, and had so pronounced  Cathedr,
would probably have imputed the lingua dolosa, and the cabones desolatorii
to his Doctrine, and the smoak from that fiery Doctrine would have had
the effect of opening his Eyes.
But as for Mr. Cressy's Idea of the Massacring any Incendiaries tho they
had been too in flagranti, if he had staid in his old Church, I mean that
of England, he would have found any such thing sufficiently stigmatised by
its Doctrine, which makes the King to bear the Sword, and that not in vain,
and allows not the Rabble to be a Terror to Evil Doers, nor Hell to break
loose for the support of Heaven, and which inculcates Obedience to the
Law of the Land for Conscience sake, and even that Law permits none to
Assemble in Arms against a declared Enemy, but by the Kings particular
Commission; and he must therefore go to China or to Rome, that will
have a Street or a Town, or the Vniversitas or Community therein punish'd,
for the pretended or real faults of particular persons.
Moreover the English Genius hath not in Story that I know of, been
tainted with Infamy for penetrating any thing of that horrid Nature, ex|cept
in the old days of Popery in relation to the Iews: and the Lay-Rab|ble
was then put upon it by the Rabble of Fryars and Monks, who owing
Money to the Iews were that way willing to confute their Credi|tors.
And since the time that that Great and High Judg of Reason as well as
Equity, and to whom the Custody of the King's Conscience was Commit|ted,
and who hath held the Scale of Equity with as steady an hand and
tender heart, and as discerning and watchful an Eye as any of his Predeces|sors,
did place the dreadful Guilt of the Firing of London, where he did at
the Condemnation of the Lord Stofford, and probably had satisfied his
Judgment for the doing of it by Observations or Examinations of Passages
that occured elsewhere, rather then at that Tryal (for there the Evidence
did not rise clear and high enough, for the occasioning that part of his
Sentence) and since the time that the People of England by their Repre|sentatives
threw the Guilt of that Fire on the Papists, and the Magistrates
of our Metropolis inscribed it on the Monument, the populace have been
as calm and temperate in their judging of it, and as perfectly free from re|sentments
of Revenge against all the Papists in general, or any one Papist
in particular, as if none but that poor angry Antiquary Mr. Prynn had
censured them for it, and whose Thunder the World being so long used to,

did so much despise that his popularity could scarce have obtain'd an out|cry
for the killing of a single Mad Dog.
I must confess tho by the reiterated Confession, and by the Execution
of Hubert a Papist, it appear'd that he did set Fire to the House in London
from whence its rage began, and tho his Confessing of Peidelow to be one
of his Accomplices in the Fact, exempts it from being doubted that Papists
burn'd London, and tho after I had heard of that judgment of the Lord Chan|cellor,
and of the House of Commons, and of the Magistrates aforesaid, and was
shewn that Papal Tenet by your Lordship, I doubted not of the Justice of attri|buting
in my thghts one part of the Guilt of the Fire to some Jesuited Pa|pists,
and that it might be said with the same propriety of Speech that London
was Fired by the Papists, as 'twas by Sir Walter Raleigh, that Harry the 4th of
France, was kill'd by the Papists; yet I never thought any considerable num|ber
of the Gentry among our Lay-Papists would have practised any thing of
that kind, tho the Pope himself should have Commanded it.
There was a Book containing Observations on our late Affairs of Church
and State, Printed in the Year 1680, called the Arts and Pernicious Designs
of Rome, wherein is shewed what are the Aims of the Iesuites and Fryars,
c. by a person of their own Communion, who turn'd Romanist about thirty
years since: and throughout that Book as he in general fortifies my obser|vation
of a Protestant when turn'd Papist, not being able to abandon all
Candour his mind was first nourished in, so he doth it particularly, p. 25. where
having in Proposition 4th, spoke of the Mischiefs we hav received from
some Popish Orders and particularly that of the Iesuites, he saith as follow|eth
in Proposition 41, viz. Amongst which the late sad disaster happening to
the City of London, (not to mention divers others of like nature happening in
divers other places since) if it were a Practice of any Humane Contri|vance,
and not a meer judgment of God from Heaven upon us, cannot reasonably
be thought to have been the Project or Practice of any other Men then these, and
to have come originally from Rome, and the Consistory there: who beside the
bad Principles already mentioned, which legitimate such doings at all times,
that they judge it convenient for their ends, were (without doubt) willing to
signalize that year (1666) with some remarkable mischief done to Protestants
in check to the fancies of some in that Party, who have had the confidence to
affirm, and as it were to predict, that in this year Rome and (their pretended
Antichrist) the Pope should be utterly destroyed.
That it appear'd a Practice of Humane Contrivance by the very Con|fession
of the Incendiary is plain, and that it was by the People in the
City then suspected so, I have said, but so far were our plain English na|tures
from charging it on any Lay-English Papist, that Mr. Marvel in his
Growth of Popery, Printed Anno 1677, having said, That we may reckon the
Reigns of our late English Princes, by a Succession of the Popish Treasons against
them, adds, And if under his Majesty we have yet seen no more visible effects
of the same Spirit, then the Firing of London, (acted by Hubert, hired by
Peidelow two French Men) which remains a Controversie, it is not to be attri|buted
to the good Nature or better Principles of that Sect, but to the wisdom of
his Holyness, who observes that we are not of late so dangerous Protestants as to
deserve any special Mark of his Indignation.
I presume not to charge or discharge any sort of men about this Fact
further then the Law hath done, whether Papists or Priests, or Fifth Mo|narchy-men,
(for of a Conspiracy to Fire the City on the day it was fired
on, several of that latter Sect had been before Convicted, and deservedly
Executed for it, as we must either Grant or Arraign the Justice of the Na|tion,
and therefore Mr. Cressy had reason to blame Mr. Prynn in some mea|sure

for concluding that the Papists were the only Incendiaries of the City,
when Mr. Prynn could not have forgot what had happen'd to those Conspi|rators,
and that the very Principles of many of that wild Sect, are for the
legitimating the most desperate Out-rages and Rebellions imaginable,) but
out of Justice to Humane Nature, will never render any man ill upon ill
Proofs, and such as are contrary to the Nature of things, as for example,
one Argument which is so prevalent with many for their concluding that
London was designedly burnt by many Popish Persons, namely, because it
was apparently true and not denyable, that the Flames did break out in seve|ral
places of the City at the tops of several houses, which were at a consi|derable
distance from the Fire, doth not in the least move me so to con|clude;
for 'tis obvious in Nature, that as the heat of an ordinary Fire will put
combustible light matter that is at a small distance from it into a flame, a
heat proportionably greater, must do the same thing at a greater distance:
and this appear'd in Fact conspicuous to Thousands, while the Fire then
broke out from the Timber-work in the Tower of the Old Exchange, when
the great Conflagration was a quarter of a Mile distant from it.
Nor yet would I venture in discourse with any Papist about the afore|said
Tenet, to call it either Tenet or Principle chargeable on the Church of
Rome as approved by it, if it were only deducible in the way of Inferences
from other Tenets; as for example, If one should say the Papists hold that
'tis lawful to burn the persons of Hereticks, and much more therefore to
burn their Houses, and to burn the Nest as well as to kill the Bird, and
that the Goods of Hereticks are ipso iure confiscate, and therefore their
Houses; and accordingly I told my Roman-Catholick friend that I would
never raise this Principle of Fire against his Church by Collision of Argu|ments,
but by the help of your Lordships Quotations referring to the Ca|non
Law as well as Canonists, shew him the Pope claiming the Power, in
terminis terminantibus, to fire whole Cities as aforesaid, and that long be|fore
his Power received so much accession of Territory (as I may call it)
of Prerogative by those great Students of Crown-Divinity, and Assertors
of his Fifth Monarchy, the Jesuites.
I do intend to entertain only this my particular friend at this Season,
with the Passages I shall receive from you concerning this Tenet, because
'tis in me an habitual temper, not salem nitro superaddere, or to afflict any
afflicted Lay-Papists who may retain some unsound Notions of Religion, and
yet be sound Members of the State, and I shall not desire either by words or
writing to imitate the ungenerous Practice of the Sons of Iacob toward the
Sichemites, in attacking them when they were sore. And moreover reason is
thrown away on men in Passion, and during the Paroxysme of Passion in
either any Papists or Dissenters, there is no frighting them from an absurdity
by Arguments, for there can be nothing more absurd then their very Passion,
and while that lasts they are as insensible of the wounds that are made in
their Principles by objections, as some in a Battel are of wounds they re|ceive
there.
But I am not without hopes of a more pacific Conjuncture that may come
wherein our Vn-Iesuited Lay-Papists may discriminate their Principles and
Notions, from the troublesome ones of others of them, that vex the knowing
part of Mankind with their Implicit Faith, like Flies blind in one Season of
the year getting into Mens Eyes, and when all empty Religion-Traders will
no more like the Merchants of Tyre pass for Princes of the Earth, after they
had with a bulk of words so long enslaved the World and its Princes, and
themselves too, and made Religion but the word (as I may say) to dis|criminate
Parties in War, and to know who and who are of a side, and that

by the Mutual Consent of reasonable men of all Parties the word Reli|gion,
will not be put on what is really Irreligion, and that a handful of
men will think it in vain to strive to keep up the acception or signification
of any word or words, when the currency of the age and that justly too,
hath damned the former sense thereof, and that all men must speak in the
Sense of the Rational Age or not speak intelligibly; and as he who seems to be
Religious and bridles not his tongue, his Religion is vain, it will be in vain too
for him to think to have ought call'd Religion against the sense of the World,
and as the Licence was vain and ridiculous granted to a Book of Physick
wherein the Licencer said, Nihil reperio in hoc libello fidei Catholicae contra|rium
quo minus typis mandetur, so likewise will the Vogue of granting any
Liberty to any thing of Catholick Faith that has Treason and Sedition in
it, be as worthy of Laughter: and then will the Publishing of this Tenet
be prevalent probably with Papists, and prove like a word in season, and tend to
the abolishing the abuse of the word Religion, when they shall be argued
with in the cool of the day, (as our first Parents where after the fall) and
their Fiery Principles be then exposed, and then may each of them whose
Religion so call'd excited their angry Prophets to desire the destruction of
Heretical Cities, as the Choler of Ionah at last animated him tho not to destroy,
yet to wish the Destruction of Niniveh, be as he was seasonably expostula|ted
with, dost thou well to be angry? and dost thou well to be angry with
others, who will not call thy firing their houses Religion, when thou seest
the World begin to laugh at the impertinence of the calling it so?
The Author I cited before of the great Question to be considered, begins his
discourse with a Patriotly kind of Sagacity thus, viz. That this Nation and
the Nation of Scotland and Ireland concerned with it, are at present in such a
posture, and under such Circumstances, as give just reason both of fear and care
more then ordinary both to Rulers and People, is so without doubt, that it needs
no Proof, and that we are in a dangerous Feaver, in regard both to our Civil
and Religious Interest, all in their wits must know: which Disease, albeit it
be now in the opinion of most come to a Crisis, yet few can determine, whether it
will end in a natural cool, or prove a distemper yet more dangerous and dead|ly.
But when I consider the great number of those in the Kingdom who
are at their ease therein, either by substantial Fortunes or Professions or
Trades, and who would account it both trouble and shame to get by Religi|on,
as an adventitious Trade, as much as a great first-rate Practitioner in
Law, who had a Receit for the Curing the Tooth-Ach or Gout would
to get Fees thereby, and to have a Mingle of Clients and Patients toge|ther,
and which sort of Mankind that by the solid weight of their Fortunes
or Industry are come to their Center of Rest, must necessarily hate all Pro|jectors
of Earthquakes in Church and State, and being well on their
terra firma will never care to walk on the high Rope with the Poise of a
drawn Sword in their hands, and who will never venture their heads by
wearing any discriminating Ribbands in their Hats, nor give their heads for
the washing or the rebaptising themselves with little Names of the distin|ctions
of Parties, and who generously valuing themselves on unmercenary
Loyalty and unbribed Orthodoxy, will neither rob Caesar or God of the
things that are theirs, and not expect that their Prince should impoverish
himself by paying Tribute to them and taking them off by Gifts, more then
the Patriots in Queen Elizabeths days did, and when I consider that the
more thinking and knowing part among these and whose ease is only infring|ed
by seeing so many objects that are uneasie, must needs think and know
that solid Trade and Industry can never thrive, nor the Kingdom by it,

till the false Trade of Religion shall be exterminated, I do fancy to my self
that we shall shortly by the strength of this sound part of the Nation, be
able to weather the Crisis or decretory days of our feavourish distemper,
and that our disease will end in a natural cool, and that as some fermentation
may be said to be perfective as well as destructive, (and indeed life it self is
but a Continuation of the vigorous fermentation of the Blood which is so long
maintained as the Mass of Blood is kept hot and Circulating through the Veins
and Arteries) so we shall find this fermentation that has been in the King|dom
prove perfective to it, and a continuer of the life of it. For as one
very useful property of fermentation is, that while it separates all heteroge|neous
parts, it leaves the basis as it were or main Ingredient of the Mass
clear and pure, and discards from it recrements or superfluities, and ano|ther
noble property thereof is, that it exalts the Body fermented to what per|fection
it is capable of, these effects do I expect of our Political Fermentation
(that hard word that is generally used in expressing the present distracted
State of the Kingdom) and that it will naturally cause in the Body of the
People that superfluity of folly as well as naughtiness to be thrown off, which
will leave the substantial part of the Nation more clear and pure, and will
end in England's Ballancing it self first and then the World, all our useless
Religion-Traders having been swept away as the dust of our Ballance.
I grant that the Animosities among many Protestants of narrow Souls,
and Principles may last too long on the account of Religion, and a great
many deluders will make a great many deluded desperately obstinate against
their Ecclesiastical Rulers: but the People of England are too many to be
crowded into the Prisons of such narrow Principles, and this great and
active thing called Nature, that is always busie and which sometimes doth
its business even by mens Idleness (and the necessary effect thereof, their
Poverty) will by the general necessitous condition of Luxuriants and Re|ligion-Traders
force them to be industrious, and that industry will bring
us to the State of a Britannia florens, and too of a Britannia triumphans, and
rescue a populous Kingdom from the decay of its Trade, that hath happen'd
by our having been embarrass'd with a Holy Kirk or Holy Church Militant
against the State, and that affirmation which appeared so senseless in the
Theology of a Popish Priest, namely, that Respublica est in Ecclesia, instead
of the Church being in the Common-wealth, will equally appear so in the
Writings of Mr. Carwright (for that he there affirmed) and to be in any
man's writings as absurdly said as it is in the Lexicon Geographicum in Folio,
Cantabrigia est quoddam oppidum in quo est Academia.
If any Dissenter should now trouble the Press with ingenious Books to
perplex the Layety about the lawfulness of the ordination by Bishops, he
would want ingenious Readers; for 'tis now as much out of fashion for
People to concern themselves about knowing the demonstrative certain|ty
of the true ordination of their Pastors, almost as 'twas among the Iews
of old to question who were the true Sons of Levi by natural Generation,
a thing that none but the Mother knew.
Our English World is likely to the end of time, to be too busie to mind
nice Questions of the uncertain Genealogies of Churches, and each Prote|stant
now will admit of the Credo Ecclesiam Catholicam without quarrelling
about the Latinity of the expression; and as in the History of the Council of
Trent (where the Thred of the Controversie about proponentibus lega|tis
runs through the whole Council) when it was told the Pope that Var|gas
granted that if the thing designed were only that the Legates shall propose,
no man would have complained, but the Ablative, proponentibus legatis did
deprive the Bishops of Power to propose, and therefore 'twas fit to change it in|to

to another kind of Speech, the Pope replyed, That 'twas now no time to think
of cujus generis  cujus casus, so in our Realm all Policy it self whether
Civil or Ecclesiastical, will now be accounted but Pedantry, that by any
previous questions puts off the debate of Capital Ships and their Mainte|nance
and Equipage; and the consideration of the necessity of great Sup|plies
for that purpose, will carry the Vote with a Nemine Contradicente
among the People diffusive here, that they will give no more Supplyes to
Religion-Traders, and that in order to the Nations being able as a Britan|nia
florens in point of Trade to keep great Fleets at Sea, 'tis necessary that
mens expectation should be bankrupt of gain by Castles in the Air, or in
fine, that the very Corporation of the Trade of all Beggars should be bro|ken
which has so much diminished our other Trade.
The great States-man of this latter Age, Mazarine projecting the grow|ing
Power and Glory of France, did not long before he dyed, wisely lay
the Foundation of it by the extirpating out of the Metropolis and other
Cities of that Kingdom, those publick Nusances there called Beggars, and
since all Religion-Traders are in truth and reallity of the Trade of Beggars,
and the Multitude of them at present diminisheth the shame of that very
Trade, the destruction of it will probably by all be judged as the first
thing necessary for the advancement of other Commerce. And as the
wisest course I ever heard of, taken for breaking the Trade of Beggars in
the Streets was that by the Iustices of Middlesex in their Printed Papers,
sent to the Church-Wardens, Overseers of the Poor, and Constables of the
respective Parishes in the Suburbs, whereby all Persons are desired and requi|red
by their Order to forbear to relieve any Beggars at their doors, or in any
other kind about the Streets, so in like manner will nature probably by the
real Poverty of People cause them to forbear to give relief to these Religi|ous
Mendicants, and will thereby break their Trade.
And moreover tho there hath in all Ages been another sort of Traders,
and who too were but splendid Beggars, and by their importunity in
Courts, and with artifice representing the Sores and Maims of their Es|tates
have moved the Royal Commiseration to exhaust its Revenue on
them, yet the vast publick charge likely to be impendent over us as well
as our Neighbours will shew those First-rate Mendicants the vanity of the
Science of begging, a Science that Agrippa doth very well Animadvert upon,
in his Book de Vanitate Scientiarum.
And there being no way for the Heirs and Children of our many Luxuri|ants,
to get from under the loads of debts and Incumbrances bequeath'd them,
but by industry and frugality, I account that they will be necessitated to
mend the Genius of the Age, and so to contribute to the advancement of
Trade.
When the Author of Britannia languens doth (I fear) too truly tell us,
p. 139. That our late wealthy Yeomanry are impoverished or so much reduced
in their Stocks, that a man shall hardly find three in a County able to Rent 3
or 400 l. per Annum, and that our Poor are encreased to near ten times their
late number within these last twenty years, and that their maintainance doth
cost the Nation 400000 l. per Annum constant Tax, and had before in p. 138
shew'd, That the Trades of Tillage, Grazing, Dairy, Cloathing, Fulling, that
formerly enriched the Occupiers of them, have in these latter years been the
usual Shipwracks of Mens Stocks and Estates in most parts of England, and
in p. 27. That we have in a manner lost the Eastland and Northern Trades, and
in p. 240 shews, That the cheapness of Interest doth not proceed from the plenty
of Mony but scarceness of security, and there observes, That Personal Security
for Mony being in a manner lost, and that there is not one Land security in

twenty that is good, and in p. 291. I hear of no new improving Manufactures
in England but that of Periwigs, we may well account that the Ebb of our
Trade is at the very lowest point, and that under so good a Prince in so
good and populous a Land, nature will hasten its improvement.
Tho the understandings of the English have in all Arts and Sciences ap|pear'd
as sharp as those of any Nation, and particularly in the Science of
the Politics, yet so it has happen'd that since the Reformation our States-men
have been so put to it by the efforts of Popery and other Religion-Trades
to stand continually upon their Guard, and have been so worn out by
continual duty, that they have not had time to make Platforms of im|provement
of Political Discipline, or to acquaint the World with their Me|moires
as many of the States-men of France have done, and the great
Ship of the Nation in its Trading Voyages (as I may say) under Sail, and ma|king
a great figure in the Sea of time, and having experienced Pilots at the
Helm of State, hath yet been so clog'd in its motion by the little fantastick
Remora of a pretended Religion sticking to its side in several Conjunctures,
that our making no more way in the World hath appeared a Jest to Criti|cal
Spectators, and no doubt but pending the Authority of a Religion-Trade,
as paramount over others in this or any Country, its fate will be like Reu|bens,
never to excel. Not only our States-men but our Princes in former
times tho their abilities were very great and adequate to support the weight
of the Government had it been greater, were yet exposed to perpetual
toyl, by ballancing the Religionary Contest, viz. of the Parties of Papists and
Puritans; which minds me how it hath been wondered at, that a strong
Horse should not draw a one wheel'd Coach with a great deal of ease, con|sidering
that he only bears up part of the weight, and keeps it upright to
a Ballance by thills on either side of him, and that by experience 'tis found
that this Horse becomes weary sooner then expectation: and the reason
of it is conceived to be, that tho he bears not so much burthen nor draws
so much draught as a Coach or other Carriage with two or more Wheels,
yet he is so bruised and banged on either side with the unusual motion of
the thills to keep the one Wheel'd Coach upright, that he is thereby much
sooner spent and wearied then by ordinary drawing or bearing he would
have been: and thus neither better nor worse, hath been the fate of our
Monarchs and their Ministers, to be continually throughout the Journey of
their Lives hit on this and 'tother side, and bruised with the Thills of Popery
and Presbytery, while they were keeping up Religion to a Ballance; but I be|lieve
'twill appear a shame to us that they should be thus the Ludibria of
Fortune any longer.
The Author of the present State of England, Part. 2. saith, That the year|ly
Charge of his Majesty's Navy in times of Peace continuing in Harbor, is
so well regulated that it amounts to scarce 70000 l.
Had he heard my Lord-Keeper Bridgeman's Speech to the Parliament,
Anno 1670. he would there have been informed, That His Majesty finds that
by his Accounts from the year 1660 to the late War, the ordinary Charge of the
Fleet, Communibus annis, came to 500000 l. a year, and that it cannot be
supported with less.
His Lordship in that Speech mentioning to what proportion our Neighbours
had augmented their Fleets, and how it imported His Majesty to keep pace with
them, if not to outgo them in number and strength of Shipping, minds me of
the Force of that saying of Cicero to Atticus, L. 10. Ep. 7. Qui mare tenet,
eum necesse est rerum potiri, and the truth of it is much more applicable to
the State of the World now, then that in his time: and we shall always be
but damnati ad insulam, if we do not by a vigorous industry so supply

our selves as to be able to supply our Princes, and so as to enable them to
make the Naval Strength of England, as proportionable to that of other Na|tions,
as it can be made.
As the ordinary charge of the Fleet for several years, came to the great
above mentioned Sum, so I believe that the ordinary Naval Charge never
since amounted to less then 200,000 l. per Year, beside the vast Charge in
building new Ships and rebuilding old, and the Charge of Summer and
Winter Guards, and of Convoys and of Ships against Algeers: and His
Majesties most exact care of the defence of the Walls of the Kingdom hath
been such, while he beheld the emulous endeavours of Nations to excell in
Naval Power, that he hath enrich'd his Realm since the Year 69, with a
more valuable Fleet then it had before: and the great Cordial that Nature
allows us against Wars, and Rumors of Naval Wars, when we are dejected
with the shame of our Civil Wars having occasioned the Neighbouring
World to augment its Naval Force, and consequently too our own vast per|petual
Charge in the augmenting ours, is that by the necessary encrease of
our industry we are capable of defraying it, and herein Providence is but
just in treating us in the Confinement to our Island, as the Dutch do Idlers
sent to their Work-houses, where care is taken that if they do not the Work
appointed them, the Sea will come in upon them: and 'tis well for us that
accordingly as is shewn in the 8th Chapter of Sir W. P's Political Arithme|tick,
there are spare hands enough among the King of England's Subjects to earn
Two Millions per Annum, more then they now do, and there are employments
ready, proper and sufficient for that purpose.
His expression of the spare hands of the English minds me, how we who
did before our Commotion only pay to our Kings, the 6th part of the spare|able
part of our Estates, (for that was what Mr. Vaughan afterward Lord
Chief Iustice declared in the House of Commons, to be the proportion that
men were to be taxed in the old gentle way of Assessments, called Subsi|dies)
were forced upon those manifold payments to the Usurpers, that
amounted to one entire Subsidy in each Week of the Year, when as what
we payed before exceeded not usually one Subsidy or 15th in two or three
years space.
And afterward when instead of the demanding of Five Members from the
Parliament, above 400 were forcibly secluded from it, most Exorbitant
Taxes were Levyed in the Name of a House of Commons, in which instead of
508 Members as the legal Complement of its number, and of 78 Knights
of Shires for England, and 12 for Wales, there were no Knights of the
Shire at all sitting in that House for these 26 English and 11 Welch Coun|ties
following, viz. Bedfordshire, Cornwal, Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire, De|vonshire,
Dorsetshire, Essex, Glocestershire, Hartfordshire, Herefordshire,
Lincolnshire, Lancashire, Middlesex, Monmouthshire, Norfolk, Northumber|land,
Oxfordshire, Surry, Shropshire, Southampton, Suffolk, Somersetshire,
Sussex, Westmerland, Warwickshire, Yorkshire, Anglesey, Brecknock, Cardi|ganshire,
Carmarthinshire, Carnarvanshire, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gla|morganshire,
Pembrokshire, Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, and but one Knight
of the Shire in each of the 9 following Counties, Berkshire, Cheshire, Hun|tingtonshire,
Kent, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Staffordshire, Wiltshire
Worcestershire, and only the full number of Knights of the Shire in Buck|inghamshire,
Nottinghamshire, Rutlandshire, Merionethshire.
And York, Westminster, Bristol, Canterbury, Chester, Exeter, Oxford, Lincoln,
Worcester, Chichester, Carlile, Rochester, Wells, Coventry, had no Citizens in
the House, and London had only 1 instead of 4, and Glocester and Salisbury
alone of all the Cities in England, had their full Number, and by a parcel

of about 89 permitted to sit, was the whole Clergy as well as Layety of Eng|land
Taxed.
Nor is it to be forgot that after the great Usurper by his own Authority,
only laid a Tax of 60,000 l. per Month on us, he afterward found a giving
Parliament that Calculating the Charge of the Nation, judged it in the
whole to amount to 1300,000 l. per Annum, whereof 200,000 l. for the
Protectors support, 400,000 l. for the maintenance of the Navy and
Ports, and 700,000 l. for the Army, as we are told out of the History of
the Iron Age printed in the year 1656: and that they who grudged the
best of Kings the ordinary yearly Revenue of less then half a Million, were
brought to settle more then double that Sum on the worst of Usurpers,
viz. 1,300,000 l. per Annum, and that by their helping him into the Power
to break the Ballance of Christendome as he did, they have entailed on us and
our Heirs, a necessity of labouring hard for ever, to expiate the Guilt and
Folly of their idle Politicks.
The Plenty and Pride and Idleness here that occasioned our Civil Wars,
and the Tessera of one of the Roman Emperors, Militemus, and the va|rious
discriminating words and signs of Religion, have brought us to the
Tessera of another of them which will stick by us, namely Labore|mus.
But as 'tis to be seen in Scobels Collection of Acts, Anno 1656. cap. 6. in
the humble Petition and advice of Cromwel's Parliament, the 7th Paragraph,
which Enacts the Revenue, mentions nothing in particular of the 1,300,
000 l. yearly, to be settled for the Protectors support, but provides that as
a constant yearly Revenue for the support of the Government, and the
safety and defence of these Nations by Sea and Land, 1000000 l. be settled
for the Navy and Army, and 300,000 l. in general for the support of the
Government.
I should not dilate on the Subject of those past Calamitous Times of our
Country, but that so great a Number of those who experimented them,
and were Actors or Sufferers therein is now dead, that this Age wants the
Poize or Ballast of their experiences to keep it steddy and secure, from be|ing
overset by Waves of Sedition, or Winds of Doctrine. There are seve|ral
Latine Sayings about War, of which the Pedantly Citation is nauseous, as
was particularly Sorbiers valuing himself on the Motto of Pax bello Potior:
but there is another saying familiar to Grammar Schools, whence the most
Oracular Men in Cabinets of State may, and indeed ought to take their
Measures and Estimates of the probable Continuance of the publick Peace in
any Country, and that is from the Consideration of the Numbers of the
Inhabitants that never felt the misery of War, and that saying is, Dulce
bellum inexpertis, a saying that was thought to give an Ornament to the
Monumental Inscription of our Harry the 3d, among the Westminster Mo|numents,
the Epitaph of which Prince whose Reign moved so much in the
bloody Track of War being there thus,
Tertius Henricus jacet his pietatis amicus.
Ecclesiam stravit istam quam post renovavit.
Reddat ei munus qui Regnat Trinus  unus.
Tertius Henricus est Templi conditor hujus, 1273:
Dulce bellum inexpertis.
And long before that obtained as a Latin Adage, it was one in Greek, viz.
: and it is well said in Vegetius De Re militari, lib. 3.
cap. 14. Nec confidas satis si tyro praelium cupit. Inexpertis enim dulcis est pugna.

And in Pindar 'tis said, ,
i. e. dulce bellum inexpertis, ast expertus quis|piam
horret, si accesserit cordi supra modum.
the sense of this weighty Adage Horace, applyes to the Contracting
Friendship with Great Men,
Dulcis inexpertis cultura potentis amici,
Expertus metuit.
And no doubt but the reason that induced the Romans to place their Ty|rones
in the Van of the Battel, was that their not knowing all the uncer|tainties
and horrors of War, would contribute to their eagerness in the on|set.
Partly to this purpose Mr. Hobs in his Behemoth or History of our Ci|vil
Wars observes well, That there were at first in the Parliaments Army a
great many London Apprentices, who for want of experience in the War,
would have been fearful enough of death and wounds approaching visibly in glis|tering
Swords, but for want of judgement scarce thought of such death as comes in|visibly
in a Bullet, and therefore were very hardly to be driven out of the
Field.
And now therefore should any Great Person descend to ask my poor Opi|nion
of the proportion of the danger we are in of a Relapse into the Plague
of War, I would give it by bringing the Doctrine of Dulce bellum, c.
into use and application thus, namely, I would Calculate the number of the
inexperts now here living, and who were not living in the time of the
last War, a thing not hard to do sufficiently for my purpose: and thus I
essayed to do it the last year when I fancied to employ my thoughts on that
Subject, diverting my self with these Queries. 1. What part of the People of
England now living, are inexperts, i. e. who are now alive that were born
since the year in which our Wars ended, or were then Children, viz. Of such
years as not to have experienced, or been sensible of the miseries and incon|venience
of the War? 2. What numbers of those who lived in 1641, about
which time the War may be supposed to have begun, are now dead? 3. What
proportion of those now living, who lived in that time of the War, did gain by
the War; for it may be said that perhaps War may be sweet to such survi|ving
experts. 4. The War of Ireland ending about the year 1653, how many
may the number of such inexperts there be supposed to be? 5. The People of
Scotland being now above a Million (as are the People of Ireland) and the
Scotch War ending at Worcester Fight, September the 3d, 1651. How many
are now living in Scotland that lived there that day, and what may be the number
of the inexperts there?
In order to the satisfying my self in these Queries, tho I know that
many do make the Civil Wars of England to end with the surrender of
Oxford in Mid-summer 1646, yet because several Acts of War in England
were committed long after 1646, viz. in Lancashire, Kent, at Colchester,
Worcester, I supposed not the English War to end till 1651, about the same
time with that of Scotland, both Kingdoms as they are but one Island, so
intermixing and bringing mutual Calamities on one another: and besides,
a few years at that distance of time would not much alter the State of this
Case: so then as to the first and last Queries, I thus concluded that the Peo|ple
of this Island in the year 1651, were and always are about one half of
them under the age of 16, (before which time as they are reckoned unfit
for War, so may they likewise be thought inexperts as to the miseries there|of)
and the other half above that age; and that of this latter half more
then one other Moyety are dead in these 28 or 29 years, which have passed

from 51 to near 80. For if we reckon only Arithmetically without any
Consideration of Geomerrical proportion in the Case, (which with reason
enough the Observator on the Bills of Mortality takes in) yet 28 
(the number of years in 51, in which the said half are supposed dead) and
27  (for the years of the other half surviving) and fifteen (for the Age
of the Inexperts from 1651) makes 72, the full Age of Man: so that the
surviving Experts are not a fourth of the whole. And again at least one
half of this fourth, either through forgetfulness by Age or Dotage, or for
want of understanding all their whole life time, may be very well count|ed
among the Inexperts also. And thus the Inexperts will be above seven
eighth parts of the whole People.
And if in answer to the third Query, we shall add the Number of the
Gainers by the War, (which perhaps some will estimate but small) and of those
who lost by the Peace and Settlement on the Kings Restoration, with the
Heirs, Executors and Principal Legatees of both, (and to these three last
sorts, the War was so very sweet, that they may very well be reckoned
for the Equivalent of three or four, or perhaps many times more the
number of the other common Inexperts) we may on the whole matter
judging modestly, conclude the Inexperts of all the former sorts, not to be
less then (9/10) nine Tenths of the whole People: and to these also they
who have spent their Estates, and cannot well live in Peace may be pro|perly
added.
I satisfied my self as to the fourth Query, concerning Ireland, that it may
bear at least the same proportion, with what was asserted in relation to
Great Brittain: and tho the War in the former lasted some years longer,
yet there are other Considerations obvious enough, that would more then
ballance that.
As for the Query about how many are now dead who were living in 41,
the Principles I have variously discoursed of out of the Observations on the
Bills of Mortality, may easily satisfie Curiosity therein.
I account that of the Lords Temporal in the Kings Long Parliament,
that sate the 8th of May, 1661. there were dead 77 at the Dissolution of
that Parliament, in Ianuary the 25th, 1678. And of the 26 Bishops that sate
on the 8th of May in that Parliament, only 2 were alive in the 25th of
Ianuary, 1678. And of the House of Commons which sate in the 8th of May
1661. And consisted of about 520 odd Members there died during their
sitting, viz. in 17 Years and 8 Months 307 Members, viz. in each year
about 1/17th part, which is one in about 30 of the whole of that House eve|ry
year.
And these things considered, we may well conclude that of the Parlia|ment
that sate on the 3d of November, 1640, there are few living, and I
think that of that turbulent House of Commons, scarce 16 are now living,
and that of the Assembly of Divines that met the first of Iuly, 1643. all the
Divines except 2 are dead. The Sculls of many of those hot Spurrs of Church
and State, that troubled us so much on the Stage of the World, have per|haps
since diverted us in the Scene in Hamlet, and no doubt but of the
poor handful of surviving Experts of them, the most considerate are not
now considering how by any Projects to put the World either in Tune or
out of it, but are tuning their fancies to the still Musick of the Grave.
We see that many of the Sons of the Divines of that Assembly, and of
other Presbyterians, are true Sons of the Church of England, and are of
the Clergy in it.
But tho I am no Concurrer with their Estimates, that make the number
of those who gain'd by the War to be small, for as the Judicious Author of the

Regal Apology, Printed in the Year 1648, (and by the Oxford Antiquities
said to be, Dr. Bate the late Eminent Physitian) in p. 49 estimates, That the
Revenues of King, Queen, Bishops, Deans and Chapters, and Delinquents in the
hands of those Vsurpers were almost one Moiety of the Kingdom, besides many rich
Offices, c and as to the multiplicity of Offices then, a very ingenious
Pamphlet written in those days, call'd the City Alarum, with a Treatise of the
Excise, mentions in p. 33. That 'twas easie to demonstrate that more then
200,000 l. per Annum, was then consumed by superfluous Officers: (which
by the way sufficiently shews the ill Managery of the publick Treasure in
those days) and tho I have put the rate of the Heirs of such above that of
common Inexperts, yet I am not without hopes that possibly some what
like a sort of Experience, that many of those Heirs have from the latest
Histories and Traditional Accounts had of the breath of the People ha|ving
blown away that mighty Ballance of Land out of the hands of the
unjust Possssors, and all their Models of Government built thereon, and of
many of their Ancestors who had by their Swords acquired ample shares
of the Spoyles of the Crown, and Church, and Cavaliers Estates, grow|ing
ashamed of their unjust Victories, and the Yoke they have brought
upon themselves and the Kingdom, and affraid of their Estates and Liber|ties,
not being ensureable under a fluctuating Military Oligarchy, thought
it the best of their Game to aspire with their All to the feet of their Law|ful
Soveraign, and to be his Restorers without Capitulation, may incline a
considerable part of such, and who are not desperate in their Fortunes, and
have perhaps inherited the Blessiing of their Ancestors penitence, by their
Peaceable Morals to make such an exception in this case, as may confirm
the Rule and make them according to the expression before used, become
sound parts of the State.
Another momentous thing cannot but be obvious to the thoughts of the
Considerate among them, and all Orders or Parties of men here, that if
the devesting the unjust Proprietors of about half the Land of England,
by the necessary Course of the Law at the Kings Restoration, did in ma|king
so many persons and their dependants Paupers, and useless in the im|provement
of the Land, and many to be Nusances in it, as troublesome
Sollicitors and Barrettors, and many likewise to withdraw to our Forraign
Plantations, and to our insula Sanctorum call'd Ireland, unavoidably make
the price of our Land sink to the proportion it hath since done, that if any
Sons of Belial and disloyal persons, should be ever able by a new Commo|tion
to introduce the old Confusions among us, and dispossess the Proprie|tors
of about half our Land as formerly, that England it self would turn
Ireland, and our Land perhaps be valuable but at ten years purchase.
And tho the Experts now in being among us are comparatively few,
yet is the work of the Loyal part of them so easie to demonstrate to
their Vicinage, every where the dreadful inconvenience of essaying to mend
the World by War, that one Harvy could not more easily among the judi|cious,
propagate a general Notion of the Circulation of the Blood, then may a
thousand of these shew to Millions of others, the impious folly of Blood guilti|ness
again incircling our Land, and especially when all our Blood and our Trea|sure
is necessary to be preserved for the Defence of the Realm, in a Conjun|cture
that hath put Christendom in procinctu: and therefore 'tis but accord|ing
to the Course of Nature, that in such a season the generality of Peo|ples
minds here should manifest such an Abhorrence of both the Irish and
English in 41, and that the Religion-Trade which had us at its feet, being now
at ours, if it should again struggle to get uppermost as formerly, is to ex|pect
from so many to find the salute of the rising blow.

And as I love to think of these things without asperity, or offering the
least Violence to the Sacredness of the great Established Amnesty, so do I
observe the same inclination to be very prevalent among the weightier per|sons
of the several Parties.
The smalness of the Number of Persons now living that wanted that
Amnesty, makes men generally concur in not esteeming it, tati to wish it
broken; but tho most of our former Empirical State-Physicians are cover|ed
with Earth, their Errors are not, and People seem generally sensible that
both the present, and in likelyhood the future State of England will not al|low
of Political Physicians, trying more Experiments on us, and particu|larly
the former churlish ones that succeeded ill, and especially in a Con|juncture
when nature is by necessity leading us to a Convalescence.
As in Boccalines Politick Touch-stone, Where the Monarchy of Spain is
represented, throwing her Physician out of the Window, and Apollo desiring to
know the Cause of it, she told him how about 40 years ago, she asking Counsel of
her Physician, he prescribed her a tedious and chargeable Purge of divers Oyls of
Holy Leagues, of Insurrections of People, of Rebellions, of Cauteries and
other very painful Medicines that had wasted and weakened her spirits, and
that he prescribing just such another Purge as before, was therefore thrown out at
Window, so would such Purges and such Purgers as we were troubled with
forty years ago, be here deservedly dealt with now.
How ridiculous will any Demagogue now appear, that should in an
English Parliament harangue it against supplying the King, in such a man|ner
as Sir Iohn Elliot and Mr. Pym did 4^t^o Caroli, who then (as Rushworth's
Collections tells us) moved in the House of Commons not to yield the King
Tunnage and Poundage, till they had first settled Religion, touching the Points
of Ariminianism.
They might as well have moved that the King might have no Money, till
they had found out the Longitude, and likewise discovered the Quadrature
of the Circle, and they by that motion would have ensured to him the name
of Pochi-Dinari, that my Lord Herbert in his Harry the 8th says, was gi|ven
to Maximilian the Emperor, for his famed want of Money.
But that wantonness of Popularity, did shew the worse in those two great
Demagogues of their Age, for the ingratitude it carried with it, they moving
so in the House of Commons as they did so soon after the great Royal
Concessions as to the Petition of Right, and might well excuse the Great
Earl of Strafford's then quitting their Company.
But I shall here observe to your Lordship, that after the discovery of
the Gun-powder Treason, viz. 3 Iacobi, the Parliament gave him three
Subsidies, and six Fifteenths and Tenths of the Layety, and four Subsidies of
the Clergy, all which by estimation amounted to 453000 l. and it was but
just in them then so to supply the Crown after the detection of that Conspi|racy,
because it appeared by several Examinations, That if it had taken
effect, an Association of Forraign Roman Catholick Princes by a Solemn Oath
like that of the Holy League in France, was desigued to have assured the business
afterward: and it was but natural for the Parliament believing the same, to
enable their Prince with a Counter mine of Gold, to blow up the Associated
Purses of those Forraign Princes; and no doubt but by the very Noise of
that liberal Supply being heard abroad in the World, that Association was
Thunder-struck, as any one else must be in a Conjuncture when the Nati|ons
abroad shall see our Prince provided with effects, as King Iames was as
aforesaid, a Conjuncture I despair not of seeing, nor of its influencing the
World with Terror as did the very sound of the supplying the King by
the last Pole-Act, to enable him for a War with France, and which was the

Cause that the Panic Fear in some of our rustical Plebs of the French landing
in the Isle of Purbec, and when some of the poor adjacent Mobile, in the air of
their fancies heard the noise of adventare Gallos, as Alexander ab Alexandro,
genialium dierum, l. 3. c. 14. saith, Gallis etiam Senonibus ad urbem properantibus
in nov vi ubi alloqutionis postea templum fuit, vocem auditam quae Gallos ad|ventare
diceret, inter exempl relatum est, was not more opprobrious then
that fear of the French that marched off an Army and Royal Fleet so ab|ruptly
out of Scicily, when they heard a voice of Adventare Anglos (which
evaporating of the French Forces from thence, as it was a sufficient indica|tion
that there was no perfect love between our Kings great Minister of
that time, and the French Ministers, for perfect love casts out fear, and had
there been any perfect good understanding between him and them, the nois'd
Adventare Anglos would not have exorcised them out of the body of that
Kingdom) so it perhaps proved an occasion of the perfect French Hatred against
his Lordship, that he so satisfactorily acquainted our English World with in
one of his solid and sinnewy Printed Vindications) and I do believe that
the future Warlike State of Christendom, will necessarily prompt all that
affect to be Patriots, instead of studying to make men unwilling to pro|mote
publick supplyes, to bend their brains in the way of Calculation to
shew what the Kingdom is able to contribute to its defence, and how to do
it with equality in Taxes and Levyes, and that he will appear the most popu|lar
man who shall shew our Representatives, how and in what proportion
the Rateable parts of Mens Estates may be rated, a thing that I hear Sir
W. P. in his Manuscript called, Verbum sapienti, has essayed to do, and
given his Sentiment, that supposing a Million should ever be raised in
England, there should be Levyed on the

People625 at 2s. 1d per Head, or
rather a Poll of 6d and 19d Excise, which is not full 1/38 part of the mean expence,
and he doth there Chap. 9. . 7. with great Judgment insinuate, That the over|favourable
taxing personal faculties and Estates makes Plebeians richer and
surlier, and that the effect of which may be feared as a tendency to Democracy.
How favourably such Estates were Taxed when Subsidies were in use, I
have shewed, and how very little they came to in the Execution of the last
Poll Bill is fresh in Memory, and yet in the Dutch Republic, when the
States raise an extraordinary Tax sometimes of the 1000dth,
sometimes of the 500dth, sometimes of the 200th part of every Mans
Estate richer or poorer, and men are Taxed therein according to
Common Fame and Report by their Magistrates of their several Cities and
Towns, and the Party grieved at his Assessment declaring on his Oath that
his Estate is not worth so much will be always relieved, it is very rarely seen
that any man makes himself poorer then common Report speaks him, by
means whereof that Tax is very considerable: and therefore for us to de|base
our Government by the making of that Tax so low, when they ad|vance
theirs, by chearfully making it so high, will to the Loyal Lovers of
our Monarchy naturally in time seem uneasonable.

I believe then that he will be the most Celebrated Parliament-man, that
can in any Mony-Bills direct the making the Levy generally proportiona|ble,
(according to that saying in pari jugo facilis est tractus) and can in the
Debate of any Book of Rates, provide against the danger of a clogging of
Trade, which he who takes wrong measures in burthening, doth (as one
saith) put a pound Weight at the end of a Pole, which is heavier then
twenty times so much placed at the hand, and doth thereby work down Land
Revenues, more then the Sums actually paid, c. and can demonstrate what
burden the People can well bear, and that Parliamentary Imposts may be
put on them in the way that men use to lade the Camel when he lies down, so
as he may cheerfully rise up with his burden, and how that which is the
second Principal Conclusion in Sir W. P's Political Arithmetick, viz. That
some kind of Taxes and publick Levies, may rather encrease then diminish the
Common-wealth, may be render'd applicable to us, (and in his explicating
which Conclusion he doth not as a Propounder, but as one having Authori|ty,
namely, that of Reason, Instance in three various Taxes for England,
Scotland and Ireland, that would encrease the wealth of the same) and
how, to provide for Equality in Taxes, Mens Estates may be as accurately
weighed as they were of old by the Roman Prudence, which for that pur|pose
instituted the Office of Censors (and when in the Censes the Civil Law
ordered the Censors Estimates to be registred, and both the bona Mobilia
and Immobilia to be registred, and even the Sums of Money at Interest to
be registred and the names of the Debtors, and this upon Oath, and in
the registration of Lands their true value was set down and how they were
fertile or barren, and every Tax was Collected where the Estimate was
made) and that the Quota of Taxes might not be sunk by Peoples being
return'd as real or feign'd Paupers, the whole City was ratably Taxed to
make up the Capitation or Pole-money for Paupers, and that the People
might be exactly numbered, and all this to be done every five years, the
time when new Censors entered into their Office, and to which the word
lustration refers, and how to Copy out the Politics of the House of Com|mons
in Queen Elizabeth's time, when the securing the Protestant Interest
at home and abroad, made them so inclinable to look on the giving her
Mony to be the great quid agendum, and on which they thought depended
both the Law and the Prophets in the English Tongue, and when as we are
told it in townsend's Collections very great masterly skill was shewn in De|bates
as to the proportioning the Taxes, and particularly by those great
Masters, Sir Walter Raleigh, Secretary Cecil, Mr. Francis Bacon, and when
Cecil accurately Calculated in the house how much a Levy came to where|in
the Respective Quota's laid on Land and Goods were mentioned by
him, and more skill was really shewn in Proportions and Estimates of the
Publick Money to be raised then has by some Parliaments in this Age,
been endeavoured after or perhaps so much as pretended to.
The long Parliament of 1640. seem to me in their Taxes in London, and
the Associated Counties to have provided only that their concern in the
Kingdom might vivere in diem, but hath occasioned the disproportionate
and immoderate weight of the Taxes in some places of those Counties to be
perpetual. And the prodigious Taxes laid on the Inhabitants of London,
during the War after 41 did not end with it, insomuch that Lilly the Astro|loger
in his vile Book of Monarchy, or no Monarchy in England, Printed in
the Year 1651. saith in p. 92. My proportion in the Ship-money was 22 s. and
no more, but now my Annual Payments to the Souldiery are very near or more
than 20 l, my Estate being no way greater than formerly.

In the Parliament in Anno Domini 1605. and Anno Reg. Iac. 3. there
was passed an Act for the granting 3 entire Subsidies and six fifteenths and
tenths granted by the Temporalty to his Majesty, with the Reasons why grant|ed,
and the great advantages his Majesty hath been to the Kingdom. And
in the Act it is inter alia said, A first and principal Reason is that late and mon|strous
Attemps of that cursed Crew of desperate Papists, to have destroyed
your Excellent Majesty, the Queen and your Royal Progeny, together with the
Reverend Prelates, Nobility and Commons of this Land; assembled in Parlia|ment,
to the great Confusion and Subversion of this Kingdom. The barbarous
Malice in some unnatural Subjects, we have thought fit to check and encounter
with the certain demonstration of the universal and undoubted love of your
Loyal and Faithful Subjects, not only for the present to breed in your Majesty
a more confident assurance of our uttermost Aids, in proceeding with a Prince|ly
Resolution to repress them and to furnish your Majesty against Hostile At|tempts
both by Sea and Land, but also for the future times, to give their Pa|trons
and Partakers to understand that your Majesty can never want in this
Kingdom means of defence of your Rights, Revenge of your Wrongs, and
support of your Estate.
They had immediately before said, We do further think fit to add and ex|press
these reasons special and extraordinary, which have moved us hereunto,
lest the same our doing may be brought into precedent to the prejudice of the
State of our Country, and our Posterity.
As hidebound as King Iames found Parliaments afterward (for as I
said) he in his Speech in Parliament Anno 1620 mentioned, That in all his
Reign he had but 4 Subsidies and six Fifteenths, yet their Belief of that
Popish Gun-powder Plot fired the Zeal of their Supplyes, and (as I may
say too) made their Money burn in their Pockets, and pass with speed in|to
the Exchequer, and with a Salvo to the Caution about not drawing that
Act into a President, c. Had I been in the Parliament that sate after the
Discovery of the last Popish Plot, I should have moved that the belief of
that Plot might have shewn it self by works of supply to the King, espe|cially
considering that the Protestant Interest was then abroad, inter sacrum
 saxum, and do hope that the belief thereof will so shew it self in any
Parliament his Majesty shall call, that we shall that way Expostulate with
the quare fremuerunt Gentes, abroad against the Protestant Religion. And
such a golden Age do I expect for the Crown from future Parliaments, that
I believe that nothing of Prerogative that safeguards the Kingdom, will be
ask'd as the price of any Supplyes, and that as I thought it very absurd in
a Country Fellow, when he called for a quantity of an Opiate Medicine his
Doctor had prescribed, to ask angrily, shall I have no more for my Money?
when as if he had had more it would have poysoned him, it will generally
appear as absurd on any Supplies to swallow up so much of the executive
part of the Regal Power, as would prove in effect destructive to the Body
Politick.
We shall have so much occasion to come for shelter under the Branches of
Regal Power, that we shall not be tempted by any leisure to lay its roots bare.
And considering that even in Republicks both Ancient and Modern, there
hath been a Parenthesis of Dictatorian or Monarchic Power in times of War,
and that all the times that all the living now in Christendom are to be fencing
with all the way in their March to the Grave, may perhaps be times of War,
I may well account that the Sir Politics will every where appear ridiculous,
who shall trouble the World with Models of Republicks, Agrarian Laws, and
Rotations, and spending time in the contrivance of Ballotting Boxes, and
raise a dust in mens eyes with the Ballance of Land at home, when we shall

be forced still to look out sharp to keep the ballance of Power exact in the
whole World abroad, and shall think time better imployed in notions of
the building great Capital Ships to defend our Interest, in and by the Ocean,
then in furnishing such little wooden ware for a Fantastick Oceana, and
shall essay from an Oceana or Vtopia to introduce an Establishment of one
Assembly only to propose, and another only to Enact such things as the
other shall propose, a thing that an English House of Commons would na|turally
as much loath as to be tyed from eating any meat, but what a House
of Lords should chew for them; and yet is this divided or double-bottom
Supream Power of the two Assemblies by our Airy Dreamers made essential
for the preventing the Divulsion of their Government. I lately mention|ed
the proponentibus legatis to be the thred of Controversie that ran
through the whole Council of Trent, and he who reads all Father Pauls
History of it, will find that question to animate the whole, and to be
there, tota in toto and as it were all in every part of it. The chiefest of
the Cardinals were the Popes Legates in that Council, and they were by
their Interest tied sufficiently to propound nothing but what should promote
the Papal Power, but in Book 6th 'tis said, That the Pope had advice
from his Nuntio in Spain, that the most Catholick King was much displeased
with the Style of Proponentibus legatis, allowed in the first Session, and that
the Pope excused it as introduced without his privity, but that however he
would not quit it nor have it permitted that every turbulent person there
might propound what he pleased. And there in Book 7th 'tis said, That the
Pope on further application from the Ambassadors of Princes that that
Clause might be damned, as contrary to the liberty of Ambassadors and Bi|shops
in propounding what they thought profitable, those for their States and
these for their Churches, the Pope gave them good words about it but did no|thing,
and Book 10th, The Spanish Ambassador desiring the Retractation of
that Clause, and that otherwise the Council could not be called free, and that
its freedom was to be dated only from the time of such Retractation, and
that the Emperor insisted on its abrogation, and that by reason of that Clause
no German had yet come to that Council, yet nothing was effected for its revo|king,
and still the Proponentibus legatis stood as a Rock, and all their Ad|dresses
dash'd themselves in pieces, producing nothing but the froath of
excusatory words from the Pope about it: and in fine all that could be
gained was, in the end of the Council, after that Clause had had its full ef|fect,
and done all its Execution against the freedom of the Council, and parti|cularly
of the Ambassadors and Bishops there, and was like a Post-horse ridd
to his Stage, and had brought all the Cloak-bags with the Holy Ghost from
Rome, to turn it to grass with a Formal Declaration or Protestation contrary
to Fact, that the meaning of the Synod was not by that Clause to change in
any part the usual manner of handling matters in general Councils, c. A
crying Con licensa to the Bishops and Ambassadors after the cutting of the
Throats of their Liberties. And now can any Opiniatre yet further
think that a Representative of English Commoners will ever think those Re|publican
Projectors of liberty, who do bare faced cut them off from the
freedom of their share in Enacting any thing but what another House shall
propound, and that nothing shall have the Sanction of Law, but what
enters the Stage with a proponentibus Patriciis, or by the Proposition of any
other House, the Style of one of Cromwels two Houses, and who do set
up for Inventors in Politics by reviving the exploded Constitution of the A|thenians
among whom Anacharsis observed, Wise men did consult and Fools
determine.

But the days are pass'd and gone, that gave People of subtle and uneasie
Brains the leisure of digging in Politics further than the Center, which
whoever doth, digs not downward but upwards, and that Center I account
the ancient lex terrae to be, and he who hath got beyond that doth dig|ging
upwards destroy the real Foundations of Churches and States, while he
is laying imaginary ones.
But since according to the saying in hieme nil movendum, men of Sense
who love to be tampering with Physick in other seasons, will in that be
averse from stirring the humours and trying Conclusions on themselves and
in the churlish State of the World abroad that is in prospect, all State Empi|rics
that would any where advise a change of Fundamental Governments,
will find an unruly Patient of the World, and all our sober Political Virtu|osi
will be necessarily inclined to study how to maintain and support our
old Government, instead of projecting any new one. And in order to the
support of our old one, I dare say that there will be no more suspension of
Royal Aids on the account of the Arminian Controversie, or the freedom
of our Wills, while we are busied in preparing to defend the freedom of our
Estates and Bodies from Forraigners, and securing both Prince and Peoples
not being predestinated to ruine by them.
The Extinguishing the maintenance of the Clergy will not pass for a
new Evangelical Light, but the exactest provision for the Enabling Crown'd
Heads to support their Civil Government and their Clergy, and with the
observance of equality and proportion in the same respecting the State of
their Kingdoms, will be worthy the thoughts of the most illuminated Do|ctors:
for as among the Divines it is on all hands agreed, that from the
40th Chap. of the Prophecy of Ezekiel to the end of that Book, the thing chief|ly
designed in the Portraiture of the great Vision of the Prophet is to repre|sent
the figure of Church and State under the Gospel, so there is great pro|portion
kept in the same, and not only the curious colouring but the exact|ness
of draught and design required in a great Historical Painting; and no
wonder if the same appeared so express'd on the Table of the Prophets ima|gination,
when God himself was pleas'd there to paint it partly after the
exactness and proportion of the Iewish Oeconomy, and with many Addi|tions
of Curiosity, and to which tho a litteral interpretation is not applica|ble,
and on which tho no expectance of the Erection of another material
Temple at Ierusalem or in Iudea is to be founded, or of 12000 Reeds of
Land for the Temple and Priests, yet may it thence be naturally inferred
that the preserving of orderly proportion in the Revenue of the Prince and
Priest, and with respect to number Weight and Measure in the Future times
of the Gospel, was then the care and design of Providence. The 45th Chap|ter
that doth so nicely assign the Portion, for the Prince and Priest, ordains
or rather predicts a Royal Patrimony for the Prince in the way of a bal|lance
of Land, as 'tis said in the 8th Verse, In the Land shall be his Posses|sion
in Israel, and my Princes shall no more oppress my People, and the rest of the
Land shall they give to the House of Israel according to their Tribes.
The consideration of this may probably reforme the men of curious ima|gination
who are still making the Metal of Government more fine than the
Standard, and thinking to leave out there the necessary Mixture of the
baser allay that the frail State of humanity requires to make it currant, and
without which it would be too brittle for use, and projecting how to make
the Government of Church and State with ease to live upon nothing, or on
Taxes in a confused and blundering manner laid, when the thought of an
inspired Prophet in this Vision relating to the time of the Gospel the which
is called by the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, the time of Reforma|tion

applied all the exactness of Mathematics to the supporting both the
Crown, and use of the Keys by an ample and certain Revenue. And as
the great Tax of Augustus on the Roman World or  by way of Capita|tion
or Pole near the time of our Saviors Birth, served to confirm
the Christian Religion in the accomplishment of the Prediction of Christs
being born in Bethlem, and to cause Ioseph and Mary's going thither, a re|sembling
effect in the Confirmation of the most rational kind of the Chri|stian
Religion, I mean the Protestant, do I expect from our Future Legal
and Equal Taxes; and as I mentioned my Lord Bacon's saying of the Par|liaments
being yet in debt to the Church since Harry the 8ths time, so it
may perhaps as justly be said that they are in debt to the Crown for the
safety of the Protestant Religion since Queen Elizabeth's, who as I have
been informed from some well Vers'd in our Exchequer Records) alienated
more of the Patrimony of the Crown then any English Prince ever did,
and that in order to her raising those great Sums before mentioned, which
were necessary for the securing the Protestant Religion, and rivetting it in
fast to our Laws and Government, and I am the more apt to credit such
my Information because I see not by what other way she could raise those
vast Sums, but by such alienation of the Crown Lands, her ordinary expen|ces,
probably coming near such her receits, which one may partly guess
by what Sir Robert Cotton in his abstract of the Records of the Tower touching
the Kings Revenue affirms, (Ex Computo Dom. Burleigh The saurar.) that
Anno 12, her Revenue besides the Wards, and Dutchy of Lancaster was
188197 l. 4 s. and the Payments and Assignmets were 110612 l. 13 s. of which
the Houshold was 30000 l. Privy Purse 2000 l. Admiralty 30000 l. and Sir
Robert Cotton in that Book mentions that she did pawn her Iewels in the Tower,
and often morgage her Land: which no doubt she was constrained to do for the
great end aforesaid, her ordinary Revenue and extraordinary Supplies of
Subsidies not being adequate to the great Sums that her Measures of State
and Religion caus'd her to expend. And to how low an Ebb the Crown
Lands were fall'n in the late Kings time, from what they were in the 12th
year of her Reign (and when they were perhaps about 200,000l. per Annum)
appears in a Book of Mr. Christopher Verion an Exchequer man dedicated to
Sir Iohn Culpeper under Treasurer of his Majesties Exchequer, where 'tis said
that the Revenues of the Kings Lands now in charge before his Majesties Audi|tors,
amounted in the whole to 100,000l. per Annum, and consisted then for
the most part of Fee-Farms and certain Rents.
I have before mentioned that she laid the Foundation of the Protestant Re|ligion,
being here semper eadem:  as in the Metropolis of Holland the Foun|dation
of a House ordinarily costs as much as the superstructure, thus ex|penceful
to the Crown did the Foundation of Protestancy by her prove: and
she needed not the Precaution in these words of St. Luke, For which of you in|tending
to build a Tower, sits not down first and counts the cost whether he hath su|fficient
to finish it, lest happily after he hath laid the Foundation, and is not able to
finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, saying, This man began to build
and was not able to finish. She laid the Foundation of our English Gospel so deep
in the Law of the Land, that (God be thanked) the Romanists have not been
able to mock it further then by calling it a Parliament-Religion, and by my
consent let them that way still mock on, and I shall mock at them who think
that any Religion but protestancy here will ever have a Parliamentary San|ction;
and if Popery had not been a Parliamentary Religion here in the Ma|rian
dayes, her Reign had not (as I may say) been infamous by the occasion
of any Noble Army of Martyrs, nor the Eclipse, of Justice and Mercy, and
the English good nature in her vile Quinquennium been made an Epoche of

Horror in the English Story, as great Eclipses of old in Chronology, like
notches in the Line of Time for Mens Memories to fasten on, served as
dates of Epoches to measure it by; and setting aside some just ground of fear of
Poperies being here permitted by Heaven to be an Epidemical opinion of Re|ligion,
as a just Punishment of such defection from Morality, I think the fear
of the Kingdoms being Shipwrack't on it, and sustaining thereby such perse|cution
as was in Bohemia, would be as much to be mocked as Shakespears Ship|wrack
in Bohemia, and the fear of the Writ De haretico comburendo grillading
any more Christians be as ridiculous as Lithgows mentioning in his Travels,
that in a hot Country he saw Geese roasted in and by the Sun.
But My Lord (raillery apart) the Protestant Religion that before Queen
Elizabeth's Reign was only like a Picture hanging on the Wall, and easie to
be removed without Fatal Prejudice to the Kingdom, hath since been so in|corporated
into our Laws, and the heart of our Politicks, that like the old
Fresco Painting appearing on Walls and there wrought deeply in, it cannot
be removed but with the Wall it self: and whatever Popish Bishops or
Iudges any Prince of that persuasion may possibly hereafter appoint, they
must till some of our Acts of Parliament can be Repeal'd, which declare
Popery to be against God's Law, give Judgment, that it is so; accordingly
as 'tis rationally resolved in Vaughan's Reports in the Case of Thomas Hill
vers. Thomas Good, where 'tis occasionally said, That if a Marriage be de|clared
by Act of Parliament to be against God's Law, we must admit it to be so,
for by a Law, that is, by an Act of Parliament it is so declared.
There is nothing I am more ashamed of in many Protestants who pass
for first-rate ones, and carry not only swoln Sails of Profession of it but
Flaggs as Demagogues, then to see them as I said value themselves on
their excessive Fears of Papists and Popery. I would wish that such inti|midated
Protestants (if really they suffer that Passion, and are afraid of
the Fire of those Faggots, that they are more distant in nature from, then
from the heat of Mount Aetna, and talk after the Rate of the Martyr in his
Letter to Cranmer, that they must prepare to hold out to the Fire Inclusive)
would not by their pittiful ill boding fears stain the Noble Prophecies of some
English Martyrs, when the Fire was kindled about them at the Stake. The
Acts and Monuments will tell them how at the Martyrdom of Ridley and
Latimer, That when a Faggot was kindled with fire and laid down at Ridleys
Feet, Latimer spake to him in these words, Be of good comfort Mr. Ridley,
and play the man; We shall this day light such a Candle in England, as I
trust shall never be put out. But what is somewhat more extraordinary and
which I remember not to have heard any one observe out of the Acts and
Monuments, is in the Relation of the Tryal of Roger Holland a Merchant-Taylor
of London, how Bishop Bonner heard him say after the Sentence of
Condemnation was read, God hath heard the Prayer of his Servants which hath
been powred forth with Tears for his afflicted Saints, whom you daily persecute.
But this I dare be bold in God to speak, which by his Spirit I am moved to
say, that God will shorten your hand of Cruelty, c. For after this day in this
place shall there not be any by you put to the Tryal of Fire and Faggot: and
Mr. Fox saith, That after that day there never was one that suffered in
Smithfield for the Testimony of the Gospel.
And the Prophetic Impetus of George Sophocard a Scotch Minister was ve|ry
remarkable (as Buchanan in his 15th Book of his History relates it) and
when the Cardinal in Scotland and his Train of Priests were Spectators
of the Tragedy of the Martyr, he fixed his eye on the Cardinal and said,
That the Cardinal who there gazeth on me with so much Pomp and Pride, within
a few days shall fall there with more Ignominy then he now sits with State, and

so it fell out that the Cardinals Carcase was shortly dragged with infamy by that
very place.
It is somewhat natural for dying men, and perhaps for all unfortunate
men to offer at Prophecy. They who have good Cards dealt them in one
Game, trouble not themselves to Prophecy that they shall have either good
or bad ones in the next; and few who have sound minds in sound bodies
and with sound Estates, can tune their thoughts to Divination. But as I
would not rashly embrace, so neither would I trample on the Predictions of
Pious men in their last Agonies, and particularly of what they who
are Gods Witnesses or Martyrs Predict about the Cause of Religion: for it
is the Lot of Witnesses in any Cause, to be frequently entrusted with the
Secrets of it. But however the most raised Intenseness of Humane Nature
near its period in any men may tempt them to believe that the things they
wish to the World will have their certain Birth in it, yet whether
God doth then inspire them with the knowledg of Futurity I know not:
but know that the very Prediction of Future things from dying men of va|lued
Fame, is according to natural Causes, an Engin in the hand of Fate
to bring the things predicted to an accomplishment. For it being sound
that Sagacious men on the Confines of Eternity have foretold any alterations
in the World, such as wish the same will think them first possible, and
then by degrees likely, and then by the next thought certain to come to
pass, and that therefore they are safe by Heavens Office of Ensurance that
their Embarquing in Designs to bring those things into practice will be
prosperous. However when we see those Martyrs both living in Story,
and their Predictions in Nature, and when our Martyrology hath repre|sented
to us with what an Heroick Bravery their Souls flew up to Heaven
from the Flames, like the Eagles cut loose and Towring aloft from the Fu|neral
Piles of the Roman Emperors as they were going to be made Divi,
can we be dispirited by dull fears and suppositions of Protestancy, and our
Laws loosing their Vigour, and be Proditors of the honour of out dying
Martyrs? I do rather both hope and believe that as dead mens Sculls do
serve to strengthen the heads and feet of the Epileptick living, that the ashes
of those Marian Martyrs will confirm the faltring paces of our weaker Pro|testants
from staggering into an excess of the fears of Popery.
And as in the Hospitals of the mad it is often seen that an Hypochondriac
Person whom irrational fears and fancied dangers brought thither, is by a
real danger, imminent on his Family or Estate, frightning him into his
Senses led out from thence; such a Restoration of People to their Wits, do I
expect from the present and probable Future State of Christendom, and
that it will necessarily rescue us from unnecessary fears as likewise from all
Curiosities, that would imply our ingratitude to Heaven while we would il|legally
mend our own Country after the example of other parts of the
World that is almost the only quiet part in it: and Propounders will I believe
every day grow more out of request who would make Earthquakes by tel|ling
us of the danger of falling Skies. It may perhaps be rationally estimated
that the greatest part of mad men becomes such by extravagant Suppositi|ons,
and that the Quid si Coelum ruat is the Foundation of most Bedlams, and
likewise the subversion of most States by Intestine War, making them ap|pear
as much the Ludibrium of Fortune, as was the Story'd Fate of the two
Brothers killing one another on occasion, tho not of falling Skies, yet of
their imaginations travelling thither, and ones Supposition of his having
Pasture Ground as spacious as the Firmament, and the others of his having
as many Sheep as there were Stars there, and his demanding their being
pastured there, and fatally resenting its being denyed him.

What a grave piece of madness is it in the common Writers of Politics to
make it a kind of Proverbial saying, as I find it used by Reinkingh in his
Tractatus de Regimine seculari  ecclesiastico as well as by other dull Learned
Writers of Politics, namely, that a Prince may be resisted Si navem Reip. in qu
ipse cum subditis navigat, perforare velit. 'Tis a degree of madness to suppose
it; and the like I thought of a Supposition in a Pamphlet printed not long
after our 41 Commotion, and called Observations on some of his Majesties late
Answers and Expresses, where in p. 4. 'tis gravely said, That if a Generalissi|mo
should turn his Cannons upon his own Soldiers, they might disobey him, c.
or thus supposing with Gerson, That if the Pope goes to strike and box any one,
or with Alacius de Privileg. l. 1. c. 8. that if the Emperor doth so, that it is
lawful in such Case to lay violent hands on either of them, and thence
gravely to conclude that the Party so uncivilly and outragiously treated be|comes
thereby the Deputy and Lieutenant to nature, which is a common and
equal Soveraign to them all, as one Persons words of inference in this Case
are from those Authors.
Bodin doth therefore very wisely in his De Rep. check the affected wisdom
in a Venetian Edict against two Banditi who were Father and Son, and
offering the Son his Liberty and Estate if he would bring in his Fathers head:
and being angry with the supposition of such a things being done faith, That
'twere better that the whole City of Venice had been swallowed up by the Sea
then that it should have rewarded so detestable a Villany.
But it is a madness for any to trouble the World by putting wanton im|possible
Cases, and extending the Gold of Reason to such a thinness that
will make it lose its weight and value.
To an over subtle Case put, that blundering Answer of a Lawyer was good
enough, Non est ejusmodi casus dabilis. Mr. Hobs in his Behemoth doth to
the Question, What if my Prince should command me with my own hands to ex|ecute
my Father, in case he should be condemned by the Law, answer well
enough, this is a Case that need not be put. We never have read or heard
of any King or Tyrant, so inhumane as to command it.
But I will suppose better things of the Future State of England, then to
believe it will ever suffer such real madness and real dangers, as formerly
from Suppositions and Fictions, not of Law but of Injury, and when some
injurious Demagogues did often acquire both Popular Air and bread by
their but seeming to suppose what they seduced the people really to do,
and to be really thereby impoverished.
When I think how some men by false Alarmes of suppositions, would
for the lengthening their Interests, lengthen the fears of any persons, and
among Mortal men make the dangers of Plots immortal, I call to mind that
'tis not very long ago that a Forraigner who was Physician to King Charles
the First, I mean Sir Theodore Mayerne occasioned an Universal Out-cry of
the Disease of the Spleen here, and was observed in many Cases where the
Disease proceeded from the fowlness of the Stomach or other Causes, yet
to attribute it to that part of the Body which tho all Animals have yet most
if not all may live without, I mean the Spleen, but however he got his
Living thereby and so plentifully, that it may be said, that he (as it were)
made the Spleen, and the Spleen made him. And thus doth a Spleen of some
Popish Sham-Plots, and the continuance of the fears and danger from a true
one, make some persons perhaps who made the former and the continuance of
the fear of the latter: and such State Empyricks would be as much impo|verished
by the utter abolishing of the same, as some of our great Merchants
who Trade in Companies and with Convoys, would be if there were no
Argeer; but as the swelling of the Spleen proves the emaciating of the other

parts of the Body, so hath the swoln Spleen of the Popish-Plot, particular|ly
not more enriched some Merchants that Traded therein, than it hath im|poverished
the Kingdom in general, and I do believe that a Tax of a Million
of Money raised in England in the way before mentioned, would not have
been universally so heavy a burthen as the Popish-Plot in its Effects and
Consequences hath been.
But what by the bravery of the English Genius to which (as was said)
the continuance of any sort of fear is unnatural, and despair which gene|rally
grows from Sloth and Cowardize appearing so dull a thing (hu|mane
Nature being apt easier to descend into it, than to ascend by
presumption) and what by Peoples being Convinced of the smallness of
the Papists numbers here comparatively, and of the ridiculousness of the
rumour'd greatness thereof in particular places, as for example, of there
being 60,000 Papists in St. Martins Parish, where there dying ordinarily
about 2000 in a Year, there cannot be judged to live 60000 Souls of Men,
Women, and Children, according to the Rule of 1 in 30 dying each year,
and what by the late great divulsion of the double bottom of the Pope and
the Iesuites appearing by his Decree of March the 2d before mentioned,
(which makes all thinking People as much to expect its Shipwrack as do
the throngs of the Plebs resorting to the shore in Tempests expect the
Ruine of Navigating Vessels, and to look on Papisme as saying in effect to
Iesutisme, nec tecum, nec sine te) and what by the Notion so much in
Vogue and so likely to be more, that 'tis as improper to call some of the Te|nets
of Popery by the Name of Religion, as 'twould be professedly to
mis-call any thing obvious, as for example, to call Musick the Art of Rhe|toric,
or Grammar Logic, or to call Astronomy or Dyalling, by Surveying or
Gawging, and that 'tis only that that is Religion indeed, that is to be ho|noured
(according to that expression in the Scripture, honour Widows that
are Widows indeed) and what by the urging Fate of Christendom now
so loudly as with the voice of Thunder repeating it to us, that this Nation
must either now be quiet, or that the World abroad can never be so, and that
the hand of this Realm must be steady, if ever it will keep the Ballance of
Christendom so, and what by the Nations having outlived all the Malig|nant
Symptomes of the Plague of its Fears, I think on the whole matter,
we may without any thing of the Fire of Prophecy, and only from the
Light of Reason presage that the excessive fear of Popery as well as its dan|ger
will here be exterminated.
I doubt not but the former as well as later experiences of the Papists here
concerning the Inconveniences of their Artifice of making or increasing Dis|sensions
in the Kingdom (the dividing of which by them as well as other
Religion-Traders hath prejudiced it more than the so much talk'd of Divisi|on
of the Fleet) will in the present Conjuncture of Affairs incline the sober
Party of them to joyn with the Body of the People of England, in being
sharp Abhorrers of the Principles of the Iesuites: for they can hardly go
any where now in the Land without seeing a Cain's Mark set on those who
cause divisions, or still drive the old Trade that the Bohemian Nobleman An|dreas
ab Habering field in his Detection of the Popish Practices mentions,
that Sir Toby Mathews, Maxwel and Reade those Jesuited Political Interlopers
did in the Reign of the Royal Martyr, namely, to mis-represent the Court
and the Puritans to one another, and to endeavour to perswade male-con|tented
People, that that Pious Prince designed their Slavery, a thing so
false that he was Rever their Martyr, as he with great Justice said of him|self
on the Scaffold, and which great name he might challenge even on the
account of Natural Justice, if there had been nothing relating to reveal'd

Religion in the case to entitle him to it: for St. Iohn the Baptist was a
Martyr, and yet died for no Article of the Christian Faith.
It may be justly said that our Monarch fell a Martyr for the People, by
not violating the lex terrae, that he was by his Oath bound to maintain, and
by his therefore not owning the Jurisdiction of the Vile Court over him; and
moreover the Law of Nature obliging him indispensably to do nothing that
by his exemplary abdicating any Right Inherent in the Crown would have
incapacitated him and his Successors from protecting their Liege-People in
their Inheritance of the Laws, and it being a thing certain that the Law of
Nature is as much the Law of God, as is the Law positive or his written
Word (and indeed as Gataker saith well in his Book of Lots, The Law of
Nature written in Mans heart, is the very same so far forth as 'tis yet unde|faced
with the Law of God, revealed in the Word) it may be with reason
averr'd, that any Member of Mankind whether Prince or Subject who is put
to death by any Court of Justice, or Armed Force, or by the hands of Russians
or Bravos, on the account of his discharging his Obligations to the Law of
Nature, may enter his just Claim to the Name of Martyrdom. I have there|fore
supposing that Godfrey lost his life by vile hands for discharging with
Courage the Duty to his Prince, that the Law of Nature and of the Land re|quired
from him, have given the Name of Martyrdom to his Fate, and I should
ascribe the same Name to any one that should suffer the same Fate by the hands
of any Ruffians that called themselves Protestants, for his asserting the Religi|on
by Law Established, and discountenancing the Doctrine of Resistance, and
the Principles that subvert the Right of the Inheritable English Monarchy,
and doing what he was by the Law of Nature and the Land obliged to,
for the asserting the one and discountenancing the other. Thus therefore
do I judge that Name due to the Dire Fate that the late Arch-bishop of St.
Andrews sustained from the hands of those execrable Presbyterian Bravos,
who defiled their Land and the light of the Sun there with the open Mur|der
of that Prelate.
And supposing that the great Harry the 4th of France, who was so
abandoned by Heaven to little Fears on Earth, as when the Duke of Sully
was perswading him not to recall the Iesuites, to answer him thus, Give
me then security for my Life, did yet receive the doom of the Fearful in this
World for his continuing his Protection to his Protestant Subjects according
to the Laws of Nature, and of his Realm; I shall not deny the right that
the Nature of his Fate hath to be Crown'd with the Name of Martyrdom.
'Tis very possible that some wretched Protestants so call'd, may to the scan|dal
of the Name of Religion design Out-rages and Sedition, and the late
Publications of many Seditious Pamphlets by them, and the Re-printing
of some of the most Rebellious ones that faced the Light in the times of
the Usurpation, (and for example of the Political Catechism, and of the
Rights of the Kingdom, in which latter the Murder of the King is justified,
and the Right of the English Monarchy struck through the 5th Ribb, by
the Authors making it Elective) hath given the Government a just Alarm
of the designs of the Publishers of such Pamphlets and of their Abettors,
and they serve among Men of Caurion as a suspicious sign of some mischief
intended by them, as the extraordinary Commotion of the Waters is to
Whale-fishers, an indication of a Whale approaching, and from such as well
as from some of the Emissary Slaves of the Iesuites here, what can any who
act with the highest zeal in their several Capacities to assert the Rights of the
Crown and Church expect but according to the Stile of Cicero against Ca|taline,
Nisi ut notent  designent oculis ad caedem unumquemque nostrum. But
as to any who for the just discharge of their Natural Obligation and Duty,

as Magistrates or private persons shall suffer the worst of Fates, I shall not
deny the name of Martyrs, so neither shall I think him worthy the name
of an English man, or a Regarder of the Divine Natural Law, who doth
not if a Magistrate by the due Execution of the Laws, or if a private person
and of Signal parts and Learning by his discourse and writing notifie the
absurdities and inconveniences of any Seditious Principles chargeable, on
any perswasion of Religion whatsoever, every Subject being under Moral Ob|ligations
duly to represent to the Pater Patriae, and to his Brethren Subjects
the dangers imminent over them by any destructive Principles or Practices,
whatever disguise of Religion the same may assume; and it is most wor|thy
of the most generous dispositions that can be in men who own the love
of their Country, with Monuments of Praise to honour the Memories of
those Heroic Persons who were so unnaturally dealt with for asserting the
Rights of the God of Nature, and thus fell its Noble Victimes, and who in
the Race of their Lives were Agonists for it, and to resemble the Justice of
the Lacedemonians among whom those that died for their Country were
proverbially said,  and were Crown'd with Olive and other
Branches, and with Praises Extoll'd to the Skies: and to this Custom probably
the words of the Doctor of the Gentiles have a reference, where he saith to
Timothy, , fight the good Fight of Faith;
and St. Paul sutably was but just to himself, when writing to Timothy, I
am ready to be offered up, c. he added, I have fought a good fight, c.
And thus too may our Royal Martyr be said, , and consi|dering
how great an Agonist and Confessor Queen Elizabeth was, and how
often she was designed for Martyrdom by some of her Romish Antagonists,
the Londoners were but just to her, when adorning their Churches with
the figure of her Monument they placed over her Effigies, the Inscription
of, I have fought a good fight, c.
And as the old Agonistical Games were among the Graecians and Romans,
instituted in honour of their Gods, and as critical seasons for their shewing
their love to their Country by their then making Leagues and agreeing
on the great Concerns of Peace and War, and Men, then in various Con|tentions
of the Body and Mind shewed their utmost Abilities, so doth the
Divine Natural and Positive Law oblige all Christians in any Conjuncture
or Season of Colluctation between true and false Religionary Principles, to
shew their Athletic Habits of mind in the most consummate manner, and
earnestly to contend for the Faith: and indeed the Christian Religion in the
Rule of its Practice, having throughout the New Testament made Agonisme
Essential to its Morals (which one word of Agonisme is Comprehensive of
more vigour than all the Heathen Precepts of Morality include, or perhaps
all the written Practices of Piety and Devotional Books) let him by my
consent be devested of the Name of Christian, who on any just occasion
shews not himself as an Athleta for his Religion and Country in all lawful
ways by entring the Lists with all Principles of Hostility to either, what|ever
the Event may be; but still with a fair respect to the persons of
all Contenders; for even that the Agonostic Games required, and
particularly, Ne quis in Colluctatione vel pugilatu antagonistam studio de|dit
oper conficeret: alioqui ne victor Coronaretur: nay so averse were
the Athletick Laws to cruelty, that they obliged all Contenders to en|deavour,
Quo mollior levior ictus minus laederet, and especially to abhor
the Brutish Art of biting one another, the abhorrence of which I do ex|pect
will grow more and more in fashion between Religionary Antagonists,
notwithstanding the many exorbitant incivilities I find practiced by some
such Contenders towards the persons of each other in the present Conjun|cture,

wherein I have observed that too many of the Protestant as well
as Popish Antagonists have by cruel mockings and biting words and Shams,
made it their chief business but in one thing to resemble one of the old Ago|nistic
Games, namely, that of the Wrestlers who after their having been first
annointed with Oyl to strengthen themselves, did then that they might the
better lay hold on one another, and might not slip out of each others hands,
Se mutuo pulvere sive aren aspergere, ac propemodum faedare, a thing too many
among us have done outright, and thereby shewed themselves not to be so
much as almost Christians, and a ridiculing humour of throwing dirt that
the Colluctations about the Land on the Continent of Christendom, will I
believe ridicule out of our World at least, and unteach us the turpitude of
such Railery, and make the Doctrines of speculative points of Religion to
give us no more disturbance than doth or ever did the Doctrine of Lines
and Figures.
And as the more ingenuous and true sober part of the people, is now
moved with pity to Nonconformists, for being led away by the Nose from
our Churches by the Iesuites (a thing that Mr. Nye himself affirms in his
Book called, A Case of great and present use, whether we may lawfully hear
the now Conforming Ministers, and printed Anno 1677, and the not think|ing
which lawful he makes a misperswasion, and saith in p. 24, and 25, In
most of the misperswasions of these latter times by which mens minds have
been corrupted, I find in whatsoever otherwise they differ one from another,
yet in this they agree that it is unlawful to hear in publick, which I am per|swaded
is one constant design of Satan in the variety of ways of Religion, he
hath set on foot by Iesuites among us) and doth the more pity them for that
some well meaning persons among them who were blindfolded into some of
their Nonconformity by Iesuitic Emissaries, had not heretofore their Eyes
opened to see that the same persons were often Sollicitors with Magistrates,
to do their duty and put the Laws in due Execution against them for their
Nonconformity, and that such Emissaries had thereby an occasion of say|ing
to them according to the Style of the Chief Priests, after they had
blind-folded our Saviour, and then smote him, Prophecy who is he that
smote thee? and for that such well meaning persons have been observed at
the same time to importune the Almighty, That he would open the Eyes of
Kings and Princes, so hath it likewise general resentments of Scorn and
Anger against the Principles of those bantring Popish Seducers, who as they
have some Emissaries here to kill Souls and others probably ready on occa|sion,
to kill bodies, have distended the Doctrine of Popery abroad in the
World to such an excess of Cruelty that no man can Calculate the number
of Gods it hath made, or of men it hath destroyed; and I hope that such Ie|suited
Emissaries will in time generally appear not only hateful but ridicu|lous
to our Papists themselves: for who indeed can choose but laugh at the
discussing or deliberating of the Question in p. 98. Of the Mystery of Iesuitisme,
viz. Whether the Iesuites may kill the Iansenists? So very hateful are their
Principles to some of our ingenuous English Papists, that I have heard a Great
and Noble Person mention it with Contentment, that some of that Order of
False Prophets were since the Popish Plot executed for it, tho yet he doubted
of the Veracity of the Witnesses against them. I very much differ'd in my
Judgment from that of that Noble Person, and would have no man dam|nified
in the least for the greatest Crime, but by Witnesses greater than
all exception, and do account it easier to give Heaven an occount
of Mercy than Justice: but yet on the recollecting of my thoughts I
have found it so incident to humane nature to delight by ill Witnesses to
punish the avowers of false Religionary Principles, that I have read it among

some Rabbinical Observators of the Customs of the Iews, that they anci|ently
allowed of false Witnesses against false Prophets, and of whose being
such the Sanhedrim did cognosce, and so they impiously reputing Christ
to be such, did barefaced bring forth false Witnesses against him, and he
could not be allow'd to except against their Persons but only against their say|ings
as discordant: and to this purpose we find it in the Gospel of St. Mathew,
Ch. 26. Vers. 59, 60. Now the Chief Priests and Elders and all the Council sought
false Witnesses against Iesus to put him to death, but found none: yea tho many
false Witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false Witnesses,
and in St. Mark, Ch. 14. V. 56. and 59. 'tis declared how the Testimony of the
False Witnesses agreed not together. I have mentioned this as not in the
least intending to reflect on the testimony of any one Witness ever produ|ced
in behalf of the Crown in any Criminal Cause in any age of time,
and do think that according to the saying that defensio non est deneganda
Diabolo, and that as a railing Accusation is not to be brought against the
Devil, so much less ought a false Testimony. And I am moreover in any
Point relating to the safety of Princes Lives, and when there are exaspe|rated
Parties in a Kingdom, criminating and recriminating each other about
the same, inclined to do what is fairly to be done to support the Credit of Wit|nesses,
considering (as the Observation is) that as he who is bound to the
King, his Bond is good for nothing to any one else, so he that during such
a Conjuncture is a Witness for the King is liable to so many Volleys of Dirt
from some one of the inraged Parties, and to have all the particular exces|ses
and extravagances of his Life so display'd, as to endanger his Testimonies
usefulness in other cases. But yet if any Magistrate finds the Testimony of
Witnesses he would support to be insupportable, and doth not believe them
to be fide digni, he is obliged Morally to avow such his Sentiment there|of,
when he is legally put upon it.
And here I cannot pretermit an occasion of mentioning your Lordships
great Courage and Justice in an Affair that my Correspondent writ to me
of, namely, that when some Witnesses had in the House of Lords been Ex|amined
about a Popish Plot in Ireland, and that the Vote of every one in
that House was given for the reallity of that Plot except your Lordships,
you entered your dissent as not believing any such Plot in Ireland as was by
the Witnesses sworn, which was certainly most worthy of your Lordship to do,
if you thought not the Witnesses worthy of your belief, and your Caution in
your so judging, that the Papists in Ireland designed not such a Plot to be
Executed in that Kingdom, was the more remarkable in regard that 'twas
some time since published in a large Pamphlet of the Growth of Popery, that
the Irish Plot was a thing contrived only to divert and hound us away from
the pursuit and Examination of the English one. And yet the same Witnesses
(as I was inform'd) obtain'd that belief from a Loyal and Honourable
House of Commons concerning the Irish Plot, that caused the Vote of its
reallity to pass with a Nemine Contradicente there.
What Fautors of false Testimony the Jesuites principles are, I have shewn,
and at the same time afforded my Testimony to the Heroic Vertue of ma|ny
others of the Church of Rome, and think it great and pedantical kind
of Injustice to charge all Lay-Papists with a readiness to obey their
Priests Commands by being ministerial in Cruelty to Protestants. I re|member
I have read it in a printed Speech of Sir Audly Mervin the Speaker
of the House of Commons in Ireland, a Speech glowing with anger enough
against the Papists, where yet 'tis said p. 24. In the Barony of Enishoan
there are above two thousand Irish Papists can bring hundreds of Protestants
to witness their Civil demeanor through the whole course of the distemper in
this Kingdom.

And as the bloody Sect of the Zealots grew at last so odious among the
Iews, and another Order of such sicarii among the Turks, so I suppose that
of the Jesuites will naturally do among Christians, and the Jesuites writ de
haeretico Assassinando, grow obsolete, and especially in places where the
Scene of Mr. Coleman's Northern Heresie lies, it being an old observation
that Northern Countries are more hospitable and less cruel, than Sou|thern.
In the very time of the dawn of Learning ushering in that of the Refor|mation,
it presently grew odious to the first-rate Ingeniosi to draw Heretics
blood. Our Famous Countryman Tunstal Bishop of Durham (who had
imbibed so much of the Mathematical Sciences, that Vossus de Scientiis
Mathematicis saith p. 40. Ante annos Centum  quod excurrit, magn cum
laude praecipue ob sermonem purum,  perspicuum de arte supputandi egit
Cutbertus Tunstallus, and whose Book of Arithmetick writ with such pure
Latinity is commonly extant) was of such a temper that (as Fuller tells us
in his Church History) the Bishopric of Durham had halcyon days of Peace
and Quiet under God and good Cutbert Tunstal the Bishop thereof.
Sir Thomas Moor of whom 'tis said, that 'twas writ on his Tomb, that
he was furibus haereticis molestus, yet in his Vtopia rouls neither of them in
Blood: and in his Chapter there concerning the Religions in Vtopia, he
makes divers kinds of Religion not only in sundry parts of the Island, but also
in divers places of every City, some worshipping the Sun and some the Moon,
and some other of the Planets, and the wisest of them worshipping God Al|mighty,
and some embracing the Faith of Christ at first without the help of a
Priesthood, and minding to choose a Bishop among themselves, without sending
out of their own Country for the Order of Priesthood, and makes them af|frighting
none to or from the Christian Religion. And that that Book of
his may rather be thought an Original of his Mind than a mere Copy of
his Countenance, we have the Suffrage of Dr. Danne in his ,
where having said, That Sir Thomas Moor was a man of the most tender
and delicate Conscience that the World hath seen since St. Austin, and citing
of his Vtopia. l 2. c. de servis, he saith, He was not likely to write there any
thing in jest mischievously interpretable.
And if a man would quote things of Erasmus his great Humanity to all
humane kind, he must quote almost his whole Works. But how far his Geni|us
led him from any brutal ferity toward Heretics, your Lordship will see by
this passage in his Supput. error. Bedae. Dic ecclesiae, quod si non audierit sit
tibi velut ethnicus  publicanus: quasi hic ulla sit incendii mentio. Rursus
Apostolum. Post unam  alteram correptionem devita. An devitare est in
ignem conjicere? Iterum Auferte malum ex vobis ipsis. Num auferte valet
idem quod occidere? He had said before, Quas autem mihi narrat ecclesiae le|ges?
An leges ecclesiae sunt quenquam ultricibus tradere flammis. And after|ward
at episcoporum est quod quidem in ipsis est docere corrigere, mederi.
Qualis autem est  episcopus qui nihil aliud possit, quam vincire, torquere
flammis tradere? Quod si qui tractant hoc negotium tales essent, qualem se
declarat in hoc libello Beda, hoc est si tantum spirarent odii si tantum habe|rent
impudentiae, tam impotens calumniandi studium, tam corruptum judi|cium,
ut videatur citius decem propulsurus in haeresim, quam unum revocatu|rus,
nonne belle ageretur cum delatis? Nisi fallor primum designare cui male
vellet, eum curaret clam rapiendum in carcerem: ibi quaererentur articuli
tales quales plurimos objicit mihi partim falsos, partim depravatos. Dispu|tatio
si qua fieret, perageretur in carcere, si quidhisceret contr mox accersi|tis
tribus dilectis monachis, pronunciaretur sententia diffinitiva. Quod reli|quum
est perageret carnifex. Vbi theologus defert rapit in carcerem, urget

accusationem, damnatum tradit judici profano. Iudex non ex su cognitione
sed ex theologi praejudicio tradit flammis.
Our Martyrologist Mr. Fox could not have expressed more anger against
a Bishop Bonner, than Erasmus a Papist hath here against Popish Persecu|ting
Prelates. Had Erasmus then known of one practice enjoyn'd con|stantly
by the Canons to Popish Bishops at their Condemning of Heretics,
to salve the Phoenomena of their irregularity by intermedling in Caus san|guinis
(and about which your Lordship shewed me once some remarkable
quotations in a Letter writ to you by the Lord Bishop of Lincoln, and of
which quotations I beg a Copy from you by the first opportunity) name|ly,
efficaciter  excorde, to intercede with the secular Judge to whom they
deliver the Heretic over, to bring no pain of death or mutilation of member
to him, I believe the great Wit of Erasmus would after his ingenious ac|count
aforesaid of the Tragedy of the Condemned Heretic, pleasantly en|tertained
himself and Posterity with the wanton cruelty of that Farce that
ensued it, and let us see how the Popish Bishop then using the Speech fa|miliar
to some Tooth drawers just before their operation, I will do you no
harm and put you to little or no pain, did at the same time make use of the
power of the secular Magistrate, but as the Linnen Clout or Silk to wrap and
hide the tormenting Pincers of Holy-Church in.
But to return to my observation of all Popish Canonists themselves, not
allowing that wanton mode of the cruel usage and interceding with the
Magistrate, Efficaciter  ex corde, to do the Condemned Heretic no harm,
I think the same quotations mention how the famous Panormitan did brand
the Hypocrisie of that Practice: and the truth is, 'tis very abominable that
Heretics neither living nor dying, can be free from suffering Shammes
by some Papists.
But again on the other hand 'tis with Justice to be said, that some Pa|pists
whose names the Age riseth up to, for their great advancement of
real Learning, I mean Peiresk, Descartes, Gassendus, Mersennus, had as much
tenderness for any differing in judgment from them as Protestants can have:
and that mighty hunter after knowledg Peiresk was so far from eagerness
in pursuing the blood of Heretics, that being one of the Judges for Capi|tal
Causes in France, he would always come off the Bench when Sentence
of death was to be given, though against the most outragious Murderer,
and he always carried in his mind a charity large enough to embrace the
whole World, and maintain'd a constant Correspondence with Salmasius,
Causabon and other Protestants, and did put Grotius on the writing his De
jure belli  pacis, that hath taught more Civility to Nations than the Mo|dern
Papal Christianity hath done, and who hath there so perfectly manu|mitted
Secular Magistrates from being obliged implicitly to execute the
Sentences of Ecclesiastic Judges, that he hath there asserted it l. 2. c. 26.
. 4. Quin probabile est etiam Carnifici qui damnatum occisurus est hoc tenus
aut quaestioni  actis inter fuerit aut ex rei confessione cognita esse debere
causae merita ut satis ei constet mortem ab eo commeritam: idque nonnullis in
locis observatur, nec aliud spectat lex Hebraea cum ad lapidandum eum qui
damnatus est testes vult prodire populo. Deut. 17.
By the 7th Verse of that Chapter the hands of the Witnesses were
to be first on him to put him to death, which Law no doubt had the
effect of a Caveat with men against their ambitus of the standing
Office of Witnesses by tacking thereunto the standing Office of Execu|tioners.
Moreover both common observation and Cursory looking into Books,
and indeed common sense will teach us that the Papal Principles do not ob|lige

men at once to fence against Heretics lives, and against impossibilities,
nor to endanger themselves by fighting with the Wind-mills in Heretics
Brains.
That great Cardinal D' Ossat whom I have so often here cited, and who
was so renown'd for his probity as well as comprehensive knowledg of
matters of State, doth in the 86th Letter that is to Villeroy in the Year 1597.
give him an account of his discourse with the Pope on the occasion of his
Holyness angrily resenting Harry the 4ths observing the Edict of pacifica|tion,
and that D' Ossat thereupon said, That it was necessary for the Peace
of France that the Edict should be observ'd: that for want of such an Edict
France had not been quiet for 35 years. That the Date of the Edict, 1577.
shewed 'twas not the present King, but the late King 12 years before his death
that made it, that the late King and King Charles his Predecessor and Bro|ther,
did not make such Edicts of Pacification with their good liking and
frankly, but were constrain'd to it by necessity, even for the good of the Ca|tholic
Religion, and the Realm after having found that many Wars made by
Heretics served for nothing but in many places to abolish the Catholick Reli|gion,
and in a manner all Ecclesiastical Discipline, Iustice and order, c.
And that besides that necessity hath no Law in whatever Subject and Matter
it be, Jesus Christ hath taught us in his Gospel to tolerate the Chaff in our
Fields, when there was danger of plucking up with it and spoyling the good
Corn: that other Catholick Princes used so to do, whom none spoke ill of
for it. That the Duke of Savoy as great a Zealot as he makes himself for the
Catholic Religion doth tolerate Heretics in their Religion, in the three Val|leys
of Italy, of which he is Lord. That the King of Poland did as much not
only in the Kingdom of Sweden but of Poland: that all the Princes of the
House of Austria, and who are Celebrated for being Pillars of the Catholic
Church, did as much not only in the Towns of the Empire, but also in their
own proper Estates, as in Austria it self from whence they take their Name, in
Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, Stiria, Carinthia, and Cro|atia.
That Charles the 5th Father of the King of Spain was he that
taught the King of France and other Princes to yield to such a necessity by ma|king
the Interim (that every one knows) even after his having Conquered
the Protestants of Germany. That his Son the King of Spain at this day
who is reputed to be Archi-Catholic, and to uphold the Catholic Religion as
Atlas doth the Heavens, doth yet tolerate in his Kingdoms of Valencia and
Granada the Moors with their Mahumetanisme, and hath caused to be offered
to the Heretics of Zealand and Holland, and other Heretics in the Low-Countries,
the free exercise of their pretended Religion, if they will for the
future acknowledge and obey him, c. And concludes his discourse to the
Pope saying, That the Kings ablest Counsellors were of opinion that if his
Holyness saw things so near as the King did, and that the Pope was to Com|mand
France in the State the Realm was at present, his Holyness would not
in this point do less than the King did. To all which D' Ossat saith, The
Pope made no reply.
And I think it may with parity of reason be affirmed, that if the Pope
himself were to Command England in the State it is in at present, he
would be no hammer of Heretics so as to knock any one of them on the
head.
I know that after the date of that Letter, viz. Anno 1597. of D' Ossat's
last mentioned, the various Revolutions in Christendom made the Scene of
the toleration of Heterodoxy in those Countries to be altered with a Venge|ance;
for six years after the death of D' Ossat, viz. in the Year 1610.
King Phillip the 3d of Spain made an Edict for the exterminating the Moors

with their Mahumetatisme out of his Realms, and which was executed with
great Cruelty; and the Vnion of Vtrecht entered by the Provinces in 1579,
and the blow given to the Spanish Monarchy by Queen Elizabeth in 1588,
and the Patronage the United Provinces had from her and the kindness they
found from Harry the 4th of France, made his Conditional offers of favour to
the Dutch Heretics not thank-worthy, but even at this very day, tho in the
Low-Countries both of the United and Spanish Provinces there is a certain
reciprocal liberty for the Papists in the Dominions of the States, and for the
Protestants in the Dominions of the Spaniard, yet is the liberty not equal: for
in the United Provinces the States allow the Papists a certain number of
Priests to officiate among them in sacris, which is done by an express Conces|sion.
But in the Spanish Dominions there is no such Concession, and the Mi|nisters
who there privately officiate among Protestants do it at their peril.
And in the Year 1599. Ferdinand of Austria expelled the Lutherans out
out of his Provinces: and in Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, and all the heritable
Lands of the House of Austria, Franconia, Bavaria, and the upper Palatinate,
no Protestants are permitted to have the publick Exercise of their Religion:
and the Effects of the Emperor's Persecuting the Protestants of Hungary the
World knows and feels, and have with horror gazed on the Protestants of
Transylvania putting themselves under the Protection of the Turk, that they
might enjoy their Profession of Christianity. And how the Bohemians were
treated by a Jesuited Emperor twenty years after 1579 I have spoken, when
I gave an account of the Jesuites Emblem painted on the Arms of Austria,
viz. I have practiced.
That the Duke of Savoy practiced nothing of Cruelty to his Heretical Sub|jects
in the Valleys about the time 1597, those poor Protestants may under
God thank their old friend Harry the 4th, who in the year 1600 took almost
his whole Country, after his having been before in a Contest with him by
way of demand for the Marquisat of Salusses, and his having applied to the
Pope to interpose therein, the Emperor having likewise demanded that Mar|quisat
in Right of the Empire; and while that Duke was in fear of being flee|ced
by the Pope and Emperor, and Harry the 4th, 'tis no wonder if he suffe|red
his Heretical Subjects to graze or sleep in whole Skins in the Neighbour|ing
Valleys of Piemont; but in the year 1655 there ran in those Valleys such
a torrent of Protestant blood as did bear away all the dire Examples of Cru|elty
before it that History could shew, as appears out of Sir Samuel More|lands
History of the Churches in those Valleys, and Book 4th, and Chap. 4. where
in his Audience Speech as Envoy to the Duke of Savoy in the behalf of the Pro|testants
in those Valleys, on that sad occasion, he saith, Si reviviscant omnes
omnium temporum  aetatum Nerones (quod sine ull celsitudinis vestrae offen|sione
dictum velim, quemadmodum  null ejus culp quicquam factum esse cre|dius)
puderet prefecto eos: ut qui nihil non mite ac humanum (ad haec fa|cinra
si spectas) excogitasse se reperirent, interim exhorrescunt Angeli, Mor|tales
obstupescunt, Ipsum coelum morientium clamoribus attonitum esse videtur,
ipsa terra diffuso tot hominum innocuorum cruore erubescere.
And as for the Kingdom of Poland, the fear of the Turkish Power then
gave the Prince there no leisure to attend squabbles about Heresy and Here|tics:
and as for the interest he had in Sweden, which too in the year 1599,
had a Popish King (as Sandys saith in his Europae Speculum that year writ)
yet were the Papists there then (as he saith) few, and consequently the He|retics
too many to be persecuted.
The very Interim spoke of by D' Ossat, or Formula inter-Religionis as 'twas
called, was a double bottom of Popery and Protestancy, and nothing was ex|pected
to be its Fate but Divulsion. Alsted in his Chronology mentions its

Date with the words of Infaelix partus, and the Protestants in Constance ra|ther
than they would embark in that double bottom, threw themselves
overboard into the Sea of the Power of Ferdinand King of the Romans and
Brother of Charles, who soon used them not as their Protector, but their
Conqueror: and 'tis notorious that the Interim was professedly designed to
continue only till the Council of Trents determinations were ended, and 'tis
likewise as notorious that that Council was called designedly and rever for
the exterminium of Heretics; and its being called ad restituendos collapsos ec|lesiae
mores, was but umbrage and shamme. And what Quarter Heretics were
to expect from the Tridentine Spirit, Father Paul hath told us in his History,
p. 693, and that as to the year 1563. Advice came to Rome that the King of
France had made a Peace with the Hugonots, the particular Conditions being
not known of yet: And the Pope thinking it proceeded from some Prelates, who
tho they did not openly declare themselves to be Protestants, yet did follow
that Party, he resolved to discover them, and was wont to say he was wronged
more by the Masqued Heretics then by the bare-faced. Whereupon the last
of March he gave order that the Cardinals who governed the Inquisition
should proceed against them. The Cardinal of Pisa answering that there was
need of proper and special Authority, the Pope ordain'd that a new Bull
should be made which was dated the 7th of April, and contained in Substance
that the Pope being Vicar of Christ, to whom he hath recommended the feed|ing
of his Sheep, and to reduce those that wander, and to bridle with tempo|ral
Penalties those who cannot be gain'd by Admonitions, he hath not since the
beginning of his Assumption omitted to execute this Charge, notwithstanding
some Bishops are not only fallen into Heretical Errors but do also favour other
Heretics opposing the faith. For Provision wherein he commands the general
Inquisitors of Rome to whom he hath formerly commended this business
to proceed against such, tho Bishops and Cardinals inhabiting in places
where the Lutheran Sect is Potent, with Power to cite them to Rome
by Edict, or to the Confines of the Church to appear personally, or if they will
not appear, to proceed to Sentence, which he will pronounce in private Consisto|ry.
The Cardinals in Conformity to the Popes Commands cited by Edict to
appear personally at Rome, to purge themselves from imputation of Heresie,
and of being favourers of Heretics, the Cardinal of Chastillon, the Arch-Bishop
of Aix, the Bishop of Chartres, and other Bishops in France.
His Holyness it seems thought that Cardinal and the Arch-Bishop and the
Bishops to be Protestants in Masquerade, and has given an example to some
Furiosi among Protestants thus to miscal some of the better sort of
them.
In fine that which I aim at by referring to these Historical Passages is
this, to shew that some of the very Grandees of the Church of Rome hold
Principles in Religion that allow indulgence to the persons of Heretics. I
have instanced how D' Ossat in the Popes presence was a Confessor for mo|deration
in this kind, and spake like a skillful Divine when he said, That
Christ hath taught us in his Gospel to tolerate the Chaff in our Fields, when
there was danger of plucking up with it, and spoyling the good Corn: and
Theophylact on that place tells us, that by Tares are meant Heretics.
Nor can it be unknown to men of great thought among the Papists, that
the sanguinary usage of Heretics, hath much encreased their number, not
perhaps will it be denyed by the Critical Judges of things in the Papal
World, what was by one of our beaus esprits and great States-men, I mean
the Lord Viscount Falkland observed in Print, That the Massacre in France
made more Protestants in one night than all Calvins Works have done since
their first publication.

According to that Observation, That nothing surfeits soner than man's
flesh, 'tis but natural to suppose that the Papal World must be surfeited with
it at last. And indeed the experience Popish Polititians have had of their
success by dividing us formerly (as was said) would tempt them to omit
other courses and to persist still in that if it were not now generally seen
through.
'Tis in viridi observanti how our Famous great Usurper Cromwel who
founded his Dominion in pretended Grace or Religion, and was afraid of
Thunder from every Cloud of Enthusiasme he saw over his head, and
was awed likewise by the Serene and Rational Religion of the Church of
England, had no other Game to play in order to the dividing the several
Religionary Parties but by in some manner tolerating all according to the
Mode of Iulians Politics.
The Papists were the first who miscalled any of our English Princes by
the name of Iulian, and that they did in the Case of King Iames as ap|pears
in his Learned Apology for the Oath of Allegiance printed Anno 1609.
where being much concerned for his being so termed (and that too by
no meaner a man then Bellarmine) he doth with great strength there
largely prove that that name was congruous (as his words are) in no point
save one, that is, that Julian was an Emperor and I a King: and indeed
'tis a very impotent humour of Calumny in any Protestant to call any one
an Apostate or especially the Apostate, merely for the alteration of his
Judgment in some controvertible points of Faith between Papists and Pro|testants,
and which are denominable by the name of Religion; and 'tis a
great folly to cherish immoderate fears that any English Prince who possi|bly
may happen in such Controvertible Points to change his perswasi|ons
in Religion, will if a Papist attempt  la Iulian to plant Divisions
among his Subjects by the Instrument of Religion, for that their being
kept undivided and all of a piece will be essential to the life of the King|dom
as the State of Christendom is likely to continue; nor is it probable
that any such Prince can ever think in the single course of his life to make
this Nation all of a piece or united under the perswasion of Popery. For if
any one would suppose it possible that in the Reigns of three or four Suc|cessive
Princes of that perswasion, the nature of things might be so far
forced as that Millions of men might by artifice be made to abandon a Ra|tional
Religion, and one that is framed to support the Government, for
one that is not so, such one Prince must be supposed to have acquired the
gift of long life that Ante-diluvian Patriarchs had, and to extend the Span
of his life to that of three or four Princes. It is a known Rule relating to
Mathematics, That there is no reconciling time and force, and he who
would have one man do as much as four, must allow him to be as long a
doing it as four one after another.
But the surviving Experts have seen too much of the effects of the sha|king
all Civil and Ecclesiastical Polity by a Protestant Usurper, ever to wish
for another in any Case, and to have the ballance of Christendom again
broken, and the Kingdom be again divided to preserve his Families interest
and to keep that entire, which is notorious to have happen'd under the
aforesaid Usurper both of Religion and the Kingdom: and the name of
Iulian is most properly applicable to him or any Protestant Usurper,
and who will be necessitated to follow him in his Track of Politics: and
the notion of which Ammianus Marcellinus lib. 22. set us right in, where
he shews that Iulian, that he might weaken the Power of the Chri|stian
Religion which he feared, knew no way so easie as to endeavour to do
it by it self, and therefore recall'd the Bishops banish'd by Constantius, and

gave them and the People leave to be Christians tho himself was a Heathen,
Nullas infestas hominibus bestias ut sunt sibi ferales plerique Christianorum ex|pertus,
i. e. because he had never found Beasts so cruel to one another as
he had most Christians, and therefore as he travelled through Palaestine,
cryed out, O Marcomanni, O Quadi, O Sarmatae, tandem alios vobis inquietiores
inveni.
Thus did the Usurper promote the Animosities among Religionary Par|ties,
and was enforced thereby to weaken the Kingdom to strengthen him|self:
some indulgence he shewed to Congregations where Divines of the
Church of England worship God in the way of its Church, yet permitting
none to have Benefices but such as were of the Presbyterian perswasion ge|nerally,
and among such and the Independants he distributed his Donatives
of preferment in the Universities, and he took care that no form of Church
Discipline or particular Church might preponderate by his being a Member
therein. He made some Lay-men and some Divines differing in Judgment
about Presbytery and Independency to be Tryers of Ministers fitness for Li|vings,
and Commissioned many ignorant Lay-men in the several Counties
to be Judges of the sufficiency of Ministers, for their continuing in Livings.
The press was open to all unlearned Wranglers about Religion. Many of
his Military Preferments he placed on Anabaptists, and did suffer many of
the Fifth-Monarthy Religionaries to disturb the Apocolypse and the World
thereby, gave freedom to Muggleton the Impostor to set up for a Prophet,
and one of the two Witnesses, and was a particular Patron to Manasseth ben
Israel, and in treaty with him here to introduce the Iews, and tolerated
Biddels Congregated Church of Socinians, further likewise so far giving an
occasion to Mr. Marvels Writing a Book then of the Growth of Popery, that
Mr. Pryn in his Book called, A true and perfect Narrative of what was done, c.
Printed in the Year 1659. saith in p. 57th, That Sir Kenelm Digby was his
particular Favourite, and lodged by him at White-hall, that Maurice Conry
Provincial of the Franciscans in England, and other Priests had his Prote|ctions
under Hand and Seal, and that he suspended Penal Laws and Executions
against Popish Priests and Iesuites, tho sometimes taken in their Pontificali|bus
at Mass, and were soon after released, and that he endeavoured to stop
the Bill against Papists the very Morning he was to pass it, by his White-hall-Instruments,
who moved its suspension for a time, as not suting with the then
present Forraign Correspondencies, against whom it was carried by 88 Votes,
that it should be sent up with the rest then passed, and that he writ to Maza|rine
to excuse his passing that Bill as being carried on by a violent Presbyte|rian
Party much against his Will, and that yet it should not hurt them tho
passed, c.
And I suppose an Author more profound in his Observations than Mr.
Pryn, doth in a Loyal Pamphlet Printed in the Year 1656. Called a Letter
from a true and lawful Member of Parliament, c (and generally conceived
to be writ by the late Lord Hollis) there in p. 58. and the following
ones charge Cromwel home for the swarming of the Iesuites then in England,
and transforming themselves into several shapes among the divided Sects
here, and saith, What liberty the Priests and Iesuites take, how far they prevail
on the People, what Countenance they receive from this Government is appa|rent
enough by not proceeding against them in Iustice, as if no Laws were in
force for their punishment. Your private Negotiations with the Pope and your
promises that as soon as you can stablish your own greatness, you will protect the
Catholics and the insinuations that you will countenance them much further, are
sufficiently known and understood: and of their dependance upon and devotion to
you, there needs no Evidence beyond the Book lately written by Mr. White a

Romish Priest, and dedicated to your Favourite Sir Kenelm Digby, Entitled,
the Grounds of Obedience and Government, in which he justifies all the
Grounds and Maximes in your Declaration, and determines positively that you
ought to be so far from performing any promise or observing any Oath that you
have taken if you know that it is for the good of the People that you break it,
albeit they foreseeing all that you now see, did therefore bind you by Oath not
to do it, and that you offend both against your Oath and Fidelity to the Peo|ple
if you maintain those limitations you  sworn to, and sure what you do
must be supported by such Casuists. And afterwards speaks how Cromwel in
distrust of the whole English Nation was Treating to bring over a Body of
Swiss to serve him as the Ianisaries do the Turk.
The Declaration here referred to was Cromwels Declaration of October
31, Anno 1655, and which was supposed to have been worded by his
Lord Keeper Fiennes, wherein all the measures of Justice toward the
Cavaliers, and particularly the Public Faith of the Parliament, for the
punctual and exact performance of Articles with them after the vast gain
that had accrued to the Parliament by their Compositions, and an Act of
Grace and Oblivion afterward granted to the Royal Party, are avowedly bro|ken:
and in p. 36. of that Declaration, 'tis said, If the Supreme Magistrate
were tyed up to the ordinary Rules and had not liberty to proceed upon the il|lustrations
of reason, against those who are continually suspected, there would
be wanting in such a State, the means of Common Safety, c. and before in
p. 12, and 13. the Iesuites are out-done as to the keeping of no faith with
Heretics, by the asserting in effect in general, that nulla fides est servanda,
and the humour of Pope Paul the 4th is Repeated, who as the Author of
the History of the Council of Trent tells us, declared it in the Consistory,
That 'twas Heresie to say the Pope can bind himself.
And we are assured out of Mr. Peter Walsh his History and Vindication of
the Irish Remonstrance, that Edmund Reilly the titular Popish Primate of
Ireland, who at a public Dinner boasted that he never had been friend or
well wisher to the King and his two Brothers and the Duke of Ormond, did
yet write Precepts under his Seal to all the Province of Armagh to pray for
the Health, Establishment, and Prosperity of Cromwell Protector and his
Government.
More need not be said of the danger of Popery and Arbitrary Power
to the Nation, if God and man had not hindered Lamberts Usurpation
over it. I have mention'd how some of the Plot-Winesses have deposed some|what
thereof: and some of his Countrymen have in discourse affirm'd
his having been there a Fautor of Papists: and my self observing it to a
worthy Gentleman of Yorkshire, that one of the Popish Lords in the Tower
did in February 1662, pass a Grant from the Crown of several Mannors
in Yorkshire forfeited by the Attainder of Iohn Lambert, he averr'd to me
that Lamberts Son enjoys that Estate at this day. It had been just for the
Almighty to have punished the extravagance of the Fears and Jealousies that
Reigned in the time of the Royal Martyr about his not being a Protestant
(a Character of Religion he had constantly own'd in the view of the
World, both by his publick Devotions and Alliances, and particularly that
with Holland which chiefly his Zeal for that Religion made him to ensure
by the Marriage of his Daughter with the Prince of Orange, in the time
that the War between the Crown of Spain and the States was depending)
by permitting a private Gentleman whose name perhaps had not come to
public knowledg but for the figure he made in illegal Arms, so far to march
with his Religion undiscern'd through the Quarters of all the gathered
Churches and the Classical ones too, that he deceived in that point so many

that called themselves the very Elect, and who were as well vers'd in the
business of all Religions as Iews are in Coines and in the way of adultera|ting
them, and who after that Religion had always been the Staple Commo|dity
of England as much as Wooll, did almost nothing else but Weave and Dye
and Tenter the same with all subtilty of Art possible to them: and as the Isra|elites
marched out of Egypt without the farewel of a Dogs barking at them,
we were then near the point of being driven back to Egypt, to Civil and Spi|ritual
Slavery without the least arm given us by any of our best and deep
mouth'd Dogs against Popery. But the extreme danger to Protestancy
from that intended Usurpation hath been long since over; nor do I expect
that any fatality of that kind can ever happen to it from any Prince of the
Right Line, how much a Papist soever he may be, that is to say, from one
who was swathed with the Laws in his Cradle, and will be Circumscribed
with them in his Crown.
According to that great severe truth I observed before of the fate of the
ten Tribes, after they had made a defection from the Line of David, that
they were punished with a Succession of 10 Kings, and not one 'good one in
the whole Pack, and their falling at last as a Prey to Forraigners, it was the
Lot of England justly to suffer what has been here described, from various
Governments and Governors for its defection from the Royal Line, and the
experience of our disastrous past Calamities must needs convince all men of
serious thought and sense, that we can have no Usurper how true a Religion
soever he may own, but will be false to the Interest of the Nation, and that
particularly by diving it, and thereby as much depretiating it in the view
of all Christendom, as a great Diamond would be if cut in two: for tho
Diamonds or Pearles be equal and like in their Figures, Waters, Colours,
and Evenness, yet if they differ in their Weights and Magnitudes, those are
the Roots of their Prices, and a Diamond of Decuple weight is of Centuple
value.
I therefore think the Kings Loyal long Parliament did consult the public
Security when in the great Act of the Test they enjoyn'd the taking the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and thereby the laying on the takers
an Obligation to the Kings Heirs and Successors, that was to outlast the
Life of the King, and without any distinction of the Religion true or pre|tended
of such Heirs and Successors.
Of the Obligation to the Kings Heirs and Successors arising from those
Oaths, Mr. Pryn in his Concordia Discors, Printed in the Year 1659. hath
writ usefully: but because since the time of the late fermentation, many
Pamphlets have been writ pro and cn of the Political part of the Question
relating to a Popish Successor, and none that I have heard of has professedly
writ of the Casuistical Part thereof, and particularly with relation to those
Oaths, and because I have heard that in some discourse about the same in
some good Company where the Obligation by those Oaths to the Kings Heirs
in point of Conscience hath been asserted, some good men have been blun|dered
but of their apprehending the same, by mistaking the saying in the
Civil-Law, that nemo est haeres viventis, and likewise some things obvious
in the Common-Law, and I did fear that it might thence grow a common and
vulgar error that there is no such Obligation resulting from those Oaths,
and that as a Supine neglect of the use of means to find the true sence of
the same, would be very culpable, so that a serious and dispassionate repre|senting
the same would to all men that regard the weight of an Oath, be
very acceptable, I have with as much recollection of thught as I could
faily and impartially writ my opinion thereof Casuistically, and shall very
shortly send it your Lordship for your perusal.

And indeed as I should not think I dealt candidly with any person of
the Popish perswasion if I should be severe to him, before I had a Moral
Certainty of his having imbibed any of the Principles imputable to
Popery, that may be called unmoral or inhumane, so it would especially
seem to me somewhat like the drawing on a naked man, for a Protestant at
this time to write for the devesting any Popish Prince of his legal Property,
when few or no Writers of the Church of Rome either do, or dare, for
fear of offending the Pope, draw their pens for the preservation of such
his property, without respect to any Religionary Tenets he may
hold.
What the Pope did to obstruct King Iames's Succession, I have mention|ed,
and what favour any Protestant Prince can hope for from the Holy See,
may appear out of D' Ossat's Letter to Villeroy in the Year 1598. Book 4th,
where having spoke of the Artifices used to the Pope to make him believe,
that if Harry the 4th recovered the Marquisate of Salusium, it would be
Commanded by Hugonots, he thereupon adviseth the King to declare the
Contrary to the Pope and adds, I would not interpose to write this to you, if
I did not know that the Pope and all this Court hold that to maintain the Ca|tholic
Religion in a Country, and to preserve it from Heresie, his Holyness
may and ought to deprive the true Lord and Possessor of it, and give it away
to any other who hath no property therein, and who shall be more able and
willing there to preserve the Catholic Faith.
I met with some passages lately in a Pamphlet, that concerned the Suc|cession,
where the Author having liberally descanted on the words Heirs
and Successors, in the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, saith, as I will not
take up Arms without the Kings Commission, nor enter into any Association to
commence in his life time against his Consent, c. so any one by whom or for
whom any resignation of his Majesties Power shall be extorted shall not reign
over me: and there was another very course expression there applyed to a
very fine Person, and one so every way truly great that every Age doth not
produce viz. That the House of Commons conned little thanks to George Earl
of Hallifax, c. but according to the licence of Speech used by that Author,
I shall venture to declare that where ever I have a Suffrage in the Choice
of a Parliament-man, if any Candidate shall tell me that he served in the place
before and was for an Exclusion Bill, rather then the Kings Offers, and with|out
advising with his Country would have any one of the Royal Line Se|cluded
from his Title to the Throne, on the account of any Religionary
Tenet (for our English Antiquities afford Footsteps of Parliament-men
on some weighty matters, consulting their Towns or Counties that chose
them) such a one if I can help it, shall never represent me: and more|over
he who doth not with acknowledgments of Honour and Gratitude to
the Earl of Hallifax, mention that Bill that he brought into the House of
Lords, in order to the extermination of Popery, that I spake of before,
and with it lodged in our Statute Book, that man if I can help it shall ne|ver
represent me.
I am not so rash in my efforts against Future time as perhaps that Author
was, and can cite a great Name for the reasonableness of Representatives
advising with those they represent in matters of great moment to the State,
and to this purpose the Lord Viscount Falland Secretary of State, in a
Printed Draught of a Speech concerning Episcopacy, c. saith p. 4. Mr.
Speaker, Tho we are trusted by those that sent us in Cases wherein their
opinions were unknown, yet truely if I knew the opinion of the Major part of
my Town, I doubt whether 'twere the intention of those that trusted me that
I should follow my own opinion against theirs, and thereupon his Lordship ad|vised

the House of Commons not to do any thing against Episco|pacy,
and at least to stay till the next Session, and consult more particularly
with their Electors about it. And if according to the example of that
great man any of our Contenders against Popery had thought fit to consult
with those they represented, about the meeting those Royal and Frank
offers with hearty embraces, they would perhaps have found the genera|lity
of those they represented, zealous for their so doing: and if they that
perhaps with a well intended Gallantry of Courage and scorn of Popery,
threw out the Bills that came from the Lords in the Year 1677, should
ask those they represented if they do not now wish those Bills had then
passed into Laws, I believe they would say, they did: and if they were
asked whether that Bill I mentioned before that was brought in by the Earl
of Hallifax had not likewise passed into a Law, I believe they would wish
it had.
I presume not to inveigh against any of our late Loyal Parliaments whatever
slips in Politics were by any there made, or Arbitrary Votes there passed
against particular Persons, and am as impatient when I hear any inveigh
against our Representatives who in the contention of Popery exerted all the
strength of the faculties of their minds what ever errors they fell into, as
I should be if I heard any Principal speak unkindly of his Second, who
contending for him in loco lubrico, or fencing on the Ice did slip, and shall
be as apt as any to wish and hope that now such have consulted with their
Country as the Agonothetae, and know their opinions better then formerly,
that they will take other measures; and especially when they see the pre|sent
State of Christendom importuning us to be quiet more then former|ly,
and thus in the old Agnonistic Games many of the lapsi athletae came to
be Crown'd. The Rule in those Games was that the Agonists were to make
three Attaques on each other, and he that did slip or go back in the first
and second, if yet he overcame in the third On-set was lawfully Crown'd,
and good luck (say I) have they with their honour, who having an oppor|tunity
of a third Assault against Popery, shall out-do not only others but
themselves: and I have the Charity to believe that what the great Athletae
did in the Exclusion Bill was thought lawful by them, and that they
thought therein they did not transilire metas.
And 'tis but with Justice that the generality of the People of Eng|land
seem as Agonothetae to have judged of the temper of our Prince in this
Religionary Certamen: and I believe whatever time can cause, that yet
among all composed and sedate Minds, his Majesties deportment in the
late Conjuncture will never happen to be forgot, and particularly his
wrestling with his Parliaments (as I may say) by several Gracious Offers
and Messages relating to the security of the Protestant Religion, and to
the making of English Men everlasting Comprehensors of the same. He
notified it to them by the Lord Chancellor on March the 11th 78. That this
is the time to secure Religion at home and strengthen it from abroad, by
strengthening the Interests of all the Protestants in Europe, c. The results
of this Council seem to be decisive of the fate of this Kingdom, c.
And I must confess I wish that tempus acceptabile (as I call'd it before)
had been accepted of, that great Critical Moment of time when the curious
needed no intelligence from that Oracular States-man of the measures taken
abroad to extirpate Protestancy, and when its Enemies in some Countries
thought they had the life of that Religion as sure within their gripe as he
had that of the Bird, when out-braving the Oracle, he ask'd if the Bird
in the hand were dead or alive, and when all his Majesties real acceptable
offers were thus reiterated to all the noble Contenders, and offered like the

water of life to prevent their fainting in their Race, and that without Mo|ney
and without Price.
And because his Majesties Title hath appear'd as due to his Agonists
Crown as to his Inheritable Royal one, for having in the several periods of
his life at home and abroad contended so earnestly for the Protestant Faith,
and purchased an immunity from Envy it self (and that according to the
right of that Law in the Code, that restrains the obtaining of Immunities
only to such a one who hath striven per omnem aetatem, cum coaevis, and
hath to the Athlotletae given proof of his valour from his youth, and who
hath at least in tribus agonibus been Conqueror) I think the rather that
a Crown of Iustice is laid up for him both in time and in eternity for his
preserving the property of his Line, in some of those his earnest Messages
aforesaid, and for that he did not by the infringing the Legal Rights of
that (as I may say) transilire lineas, or by doing any thing of the Ju|stice
whereof he doubted and much more of the Injustice whereof he was fully
convinced.
As the figure of a Crown must be entire, so must every good Action
consist of entire Causes that is to be rewarded with it: and any Prince
who doth deliberate of the doing a thing in it self unjust has need of the
Caution given to the Angel of the Church in Philadelphia, hold fast that
which thou hast, that no Man take away thy Crown: and indeed for a Monarch
to do an Act of Injustice is a greater misfortune to him than to be depo|sed,
the latter being but the evil of punishment, and the former of sin. I
reading lately in Klockius de aerario was ashamed to see the 41. Summari|um
of Chap. 109th, Book 2d, to be this, viz. A Iustiti licite in parvis sub|inde
variariut in majoribus inviolata sit: and ashamed to find in that Chap|ter
Tacitus quoted by him for it, and saying, Habet aliquid ex iniquo omne
magnum exemplum, and Plutarch cited for saying, A justitia in parvis re|bus
nonnunquam abeas, si salvam eam voles in magnis. But honest Cicero
tells us better things, and that, Nihil honestum esse potest quod justiti va|cat;
and the Christian Morallity I am sure prohibits the doing of one un|lawful
Act, tho the effect of it would be the restoring the whole Creation
in integrum to its first State in Paradice, and it enjoyns the fortitude of not
fearing those that kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul, as our Savi|ours
words are in St. Math. 10. 28. and where he doth not say, fear not those
that can kill the Body, but who do actually and frequently kill the Body:
but are not able to kill the Soul, implying that unjust men often labour
to do that, and would do it if they could, and their cursed sollicitude
therein is not capable of being practised more then by endeavouring to
prevail on Men by fear of imminent bodily danger to warp from principles
of Justice, and the Scripture doth annex the Crown of Life to the condition
of being faithful unto death, and to not fearing the things to be suffered, as
'tis said in Rev. 2. 10. the ominous Text Preached on at the Coronation of
the Royal Martyr.
And as it is a saying that Must is for the King, so he that Rules over Men
must be just, ruling in the fear of God, as part of the last words of King
David assures us, and must not by fear of Man do any unjust thing that
would imply his intermitting the filial fear of Heaven, which is justly pu|nished
by being abandon'd to the Servile Fear of Man, and to that fear
bringing a Snare (as that Kings Son hath in his Proverbs told us) and
when otherwise he might have made his own wrath as the roaring of a Lion
as Solomons words are.
And 'tis when exact Justice is as it should be fixed in the Firmament of a
Princes Mind, that its brightness is above being Ecclipsed by any popular

temptations or fears, that it resembles the fixt Stars whose great height
dazles the eyes of gazers and which Stars cannot be eclipsed by the shaddow
of the whole earth.
The Populace and their Multitudes and Commotions are in the Scrip|ture
frequently compared to water and the Sea, and like that, they are apt to
be eating towards the Roots of the Powers of Soveraigns; but while the
Mountains of their Power are bottom'd on Natural Justice, all the preying of
the Sea of the People there makes but the promontory more surely guarded,
and appear more majestic as well as be more inaccessible. And of this Sea
of the Peoples as I would wish every Prince in the just observance of the Mu|nicipal
Laws of his Country to espouse the Interest as much as the Duke of
Venice doth his Adriatic, yet should I see one for fear of Popular Envy or
Obloquy forbearing to administer Iustice, and to follow the real last Di|ctates
of his practical understanding rightly informed and servily giving up
himself to obey any mens pretended ones, I should think it to be as extra|vagant
a Madness as Hydrophoby, or fear of water, on the biting of a
Mad Dog; and while a Sovereign observes the immutable Principles of
Justice, he may acquiesce in the results of Providence, and expect that the
troubling of the waters may be like that of the Angel before the time of heal|ing,
or a Conjuncture of the Peoples being possessed of healing Principles:
and in fine, a King when he finds the Waters of Popular Discontent more
tumultuous by Religionary Parties as two Seas meeting, as for example,
Papists and Presbyterians, he may depend on his being near Land, that be|ing
always near where two Seas meet: and let every Prince be assured that
'tis not only Popery but Atheisme in Masquerade to do an unjust Act to sup|port
Religion.
I know that it hath been incident to some good men to strain pretences
beyond the nature of things for justice Causes of War abroad in the World
to advance the Protestant Religion. And thus in the last Age, the Crown
and Populace of England being clutter'd with the Affair of the Palatinate,
the Prince Palatine had here many well-wishers to his Title for the Bohe|mian
Crown: and Rushworth tells us in his 1st Vol. Ann. 1619. That he
being Elected King of Bohemia craved Advice of his Father in Law the
King of Great Brittain, touching the acceptation of that Royal Dignity:
and that when this Affair was debated in the Kings Council, Arch-Bishop
Abbot whose infirmity would not suffer him to be present at the Consultation,
wrote his mind to Sir R. Nauton the Kings Secretary, viz. That God had
set up this Prince his Majesties Son in Law as a Mark of Honour throughout
all Christendome to propagate the Gospel, and protect the Oppressed. That
for his own part he dares not but give advice to follow where God leads, ap|prehending
the work of God in this and that of Hungary: that by the Pece
and Peece the Kings of the Earth that gave their power to the Beast shall leave
the Whore, and make her desolate, that he was satisfied in Conscience that the
Bohemians had just Cause to reject that Proud and Bloody Man who had taken
a Course to make that Kingdom not Elective in taking it by Donation of ano|ther,
c. And concludes, Let all our Spirits be gathered up to animate this
Business, that the World may take notice that we are awake when God
calls.
Rushworth saith, that King Iames disavowed the Act of his accepting that
Crown, and would never grace his Son in Law with the Style of his new
Dignity.
And in King Charles the Firsts time, in the Common-Prayer relating to
the Royal Family, the Prayer runs for Frederick Prince Palatine of the
Rhine, and the Lady Elizabeth his Wife: yet in the Assemblies Directory

afterward as to the Prayer for the Royal Family, that Lady Elizabeth is
Styled Queen of Bohemia.
But our Princes not being satisfied, it seems that the Palatine of the
Rhine had a just Title to the Bohemian Crown, thought it not just for them
to assert it.
However, that Arch-Bishop Abbot, the Achilles of the Protestants here
in his Generation, thought that the English Crown ought to descend in its
true Line of Succession whatever profession of Religion any Member
thereof should own, appears out of Mr. Pryns Introduction to the History of
the Arch Bishop of Canterburies Tryal, where having in p. 3. mentioned
the Articles sent by King Iames to his Embassador in Spain in order to the
Match with the Infanta, and that one was, That the Children of this Mar|riage
shall no way be compelled or constrained in point of Conscience of Religi|on,
wherefore there is no doubt that their Title shall be prejudiced in case it
should please God that they should prove Catholicks, and in p. 6. Cited the
same in Latin out of the French Mercury, Tom. 9. as offered from England,
Quod liberi ex hoc matrimonio oriundi non cogentur ne compellentur in caus
religionis vel conscientiae, ne leges contra Catholicos attingent illos,  in
casu siquis eorum fuerit Catholicus, non ob hoc perdet jus successionis in Regna 
Dominia Magnae Britanniae, and afterward in p. 7. mentioned it as an Addi|tional
Article offer'd from England, That the King of Great Brittain and
Prince of Wales should bind themselves by Oath for the observance of the Arti|cles,
and that the Privy Council should Sign the same under their hands, c.
He in p. 43. mentions Arch-Bishop Abbots among other Privy-Counsellers
accordingly Signing those Articles, and further in p. 46. mentions the
Oath of the Privy-Council for the observance of those Articles as far as lay
in them: and had before given an account not only of Arch-Bishop Abbots,
but of other magna nomina of the Clergy and Layety in the Council that
Signed the same, and particularly of John Bishop of Lincoln Keeper of the
Great Seal, Lionel Earl of Middlesex Lord High Treasurer of England,
Henry Viscount Mandevile Lord President of the Council, Edward Earl of
Worcester Lord Privy-Seal, Lewis Duke of Richmond and Lennox Lord
High Steward of the Houshold, James Marquess of Hamilton, James Earl
of Carlile, Lancelot Bishop of Winchester, Oliver Viscount Grandison,
Arthur Baron Chichester of Belfast Lord Treasurer of Ireland, Sir Thomas
Edmonds Kt. Treasurer of the Houshold, Sir John Suckling Comptroller of
the Houshold, Sir George Calvert and Sir Edward Conway Principal Secre|taries
of State, Sir Richard Weston Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Julius
Caesar Master of the Rolls, who had done the same.
Mr. Pryn afterward in p. 69. having mentioned the Dissolution of the
Spanish Match, gives an account of the bringing on the Marriage with France,
and saith, It was concluded in the life of King James, the Articles concerning
Religion being the same almost Verbatim, with those formerly agreed on in the
Spanish Treaty, and so easily condescended to without much Debate: and re|ferreth
there to the Rot. tractationis  ratificationis matrimonii inter Dom.
Carolum Regem  Dom. Henrettam Mariam sororem Regis Franc. 1 Car. in the
Rolls.
The Demagogues of the old long Parliament who made such loud Out-cries
of the danger of Popery here and of their strenuous endeavours to
free the Kingdom from it, had nothing in their Famous 19 Propositions to bar
the right of any Heir to the Crown for the being a Papist. The exact
Collections afford many instances of their declaring, That they would provide
for the greatness of his Majesty and his Royal Posterity in future times, and in
which there was no Proviso respecting any Religionary Tenets they should
profess.

It appears in Mr. Pryns memorable Speech in that House of Commons on
Monday the 4th of December, 1648. touching the Kings answers to the Pro|positions
of both Houses, whether they were satisfactory or not in the Isle of Wight
Treaty, that that Parliament that was concern'd for the saving of their own
Credit as well as the Souls of the People to make that Treaty to end with
the extermination of Popery from England, did not in the application of the
most proper means for that purpose, judge the debarring any Popish Prince
here from his Inheritance of the Crown any proper, or necessary one.
For in p. 58. of that Speech 'tis said, As to any danger to our Church from Re|ligion
there is as good Security and Provision granted us by the King, as we
did or could desire even in our own terms. First, He hath fully consented to pass
an Act for the more effectual disabling of Iesuites, Papists and Popish Recusants
from disturbing the State and deluding the Laws, and for the prescribing of a
new Oath for the more speedy discovery and Conviction of Recusants. Second|ly,
To an Act of Parliament for the Education of the Children of Papists by
Protestants in the Protestant Religion. Thirdly, To an Act for the due Levy|ing
the Penalties against Recusants, and disposing of them as both Houses shall
appoint. Fourthly, To an Act whereby the practices of the Papists against
the State may be prevented, the Laws against them duely executed, and a
stricter Course taken to prevent the saying or hearing of Mass in the Court or
any other part of the Kingdom: whereby it is made Treason for any Priests to
say Mass in the Court or Queens own Chappel. Fifthly, To an Act for abolishing
all Innovations, Popish Superstitions, Ceremonies, Altars, Rayles, Crucifixes, Images,
Pictures, Copes, Crosses, Surplices, Vestments, bowings at the name of Jesus or toward
the Altar, c. By all which Acts added to our former Laws against Recusants, I
dare affirm we have far better Provision and Security against Papists, Iesuites,
Popish Recusants, c for our Churches and Religions Safety and States too,
then any Protestant Church, State and Kingdom whatsoever: so as we need not
fear any future danger from Papists or Popery if we be careful to see those Con|cessions
duely put in Execution, when turned into Acts, and our former
Laws.
And afterward in that Speech p. 110. he shews how dear the Kings con|senting
to pass five such Acts cost him: for saith he, The Iesuites understanding
that the King beyond and contrary to their expectation hath granted all or most
of our propositions in the Isle of Wight, and fully condescended to five new Bills
for the Extirpation of Mass, Popery and Popish Innovations ut of his Domini|ons
and putting all Laws in Execution against them, and for a speedier Discove|ry
and Conviction of them then formerly, c are so inraged with the King and
so inexorably incensed against him (as I am credibly informed) that now they
are mad against him and thirst for nothing but his Blood.
Mr. Pryn had mentioned in that Speech before, that some Jesuites and Je|suited
Agitators had engaged the Army to dissolve that Treaty with the
King: and 'tis no wonder if that prying Order who knew the Kings
Aversion to Popery, as well as the most stupid of his Enemies did when
they saw him consenting to pass five such Bills, was the more brisk in exe|cuting
its Designs against him, and that as Mr. Pryn saith in his perfect Nar|rative,
a Priest present at the Kings death flourished his Sword with an ex|clamation,
That now the greatest Enemy we had in the World was gone. But
this by the way. I had not mentioned how dear the consenting to those
Bills that would have been so fatal to Popery and have prevented the
Phrase of its growth from being used at this time of day, but that some
persons not vers'd in the passages of those evil days, seem to think that
there was nothing of Religion to support that Kings Title to Martyrdom,
but what concern'd his Adhesion to Episcopacy and its Revenue.

In the very solemn League and Covenant its takers declared, they had before
their Eyes the honour and happiness of the Kings Majesty and his Posterity.
And I have seen a printed paper of the Presbyterian Divines of one of the
Associations in the late times, wherein they do expresly affirm and argue it
that any of the Royal Posterity here ought not to be debarr'd from their
Hereditary Right to the Crown, by being either Papists or Idola|ters.
If we look so far back as the great Conjuncture in the beginning of King
Iames's Reign, namely in the year 1605. we shall find that there was
then a Paper before mentioned published in Print called a Protestation of the
Kings Supremacy made by the Nonconforming Ministers which were sus|pended
or deprived that year, and that the first Paragraph or Tenet in
that Protestation is this, We hold and maintain the same Authority and Su|premacy
in all Causes and over all Persons Civil and Ecclesiastical, granted by
Statute to Queen Elizabeth, and expressed and declared in the Book of Ad|vertisements
and Injunctions and in Master Bilson against the Iesuites, to be
due in full and ample manner (without any limitation or qualification) to the
King and his Heirs and Successors for ever, c. And the 4th Paragraph in
that Protestation (part whereof I have before recited) is, viz. We hold
that though the Kings of this Realm were no Members of the Church but very
Infidels, yea and Persecutors of the Truth, that yet those Churches that shall
be gathered together within these Dominions, ought to acknowledge and yield
the same Supremacy to them. And that the same is not tyed to their Faith
and Christianity, but to their very Crown, from which no Subject or Subjects
have power to separate or disjoyn it. And in the 18th Paragraph they say,
That if the King subjecting himself to Spiritual Guides and Governors shall af|terward
refuse to be governed and guided by them, according to the Word of
God, and living in notorious sin without repentance, shall willfully contemn and
despise all their Holy and Religious Censures, that then these Governors are to
refuse to Administer the Holy Things of God to him and to leave him to him|self,
ond to the secret Iudgment of God, and wholy to resign and give over that
spiritual Charge and Tuition over him, which by calling from God and the
King they did undertake. And more then this they may not do. And after
all this we hold that he still retaineth and ought to retain entirely and solidly,
all that aforesaid Supreme Power and Authority over the Churches of this Do|minion,
in as ample a manner as if he were the most Christian Prince in the
World.
If therefore any shall think it reasonable to pronounce that the substan|tial
Interest of Protestancy, and of the Kingdom doth Stare moribus antiquis
virisque, I have pointed them to Arch-Bishop Abbot, to Bishop Andrews
the Antagonist to Bellarmine (under the weight of whose Arguments
Bellarmine fell in the Certamen) and to others of our old Counsellors of
State, and particularly Arthur Baron Chichester of Belfast, Lord Treasurer
of Ireland, your Lordships Noble God-Father, (in comparison of many of
whom when we look on some of our great Politic and Protestant-would|be's
of this Age, and who would let none be Protestants but themselves,
we may well cry out, In qualem paulatim fluximus urbem) and have shewn
how those great Confessors by their Overt Acts provided against the belief
of the Doctrine of Popery, without the barring any of the Royal Line
from the inheriting the Crown. And when I see some of our (till of
late) unheard of Statists so eager to dispossess the Land of the Evil Spirit
of Popery by illegal means, and the use of the great Name of Protestancy
as a Spell, I fancy to my self that they may be call'd on by it, as the Iewish
Exorcits were in the Acts of the Apostles, who taking on them to call over

them which had evil Spirits, the Name of the Lord Iesus, saying we adjure
you by Iesus whom Paul preacheth, the evil Spirit answered and said, Jesus
I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye? Thus to any who shall say that
there is no way possible to secure English Mens continuing Protestants,
but by breaking in on the Succession in the Right Line, may it be returned
by Popery, the old Protestants of the Church of England I know, and the
old Nonconformist Protestants, and the old Covenanting Presbyterian Prote|stants
I know, who knew otherwise to secure Protestancy, and likewise
the French Protestants I know, who never practised any Out-rage against
the Great Harry the 4th of France's Government after he had left Prote|stancy,
but who are ye? The truth is, the Protestants in France so vastly
numerous in his time (which any one may imagine, who considers that
the most careful thinking men in that Realm make them now to be two
Millions, and that a judicious French Author hath writ, that the Iesuites
have lately computed them to be above a Million and a half) have shewn
the World a great example of their Protestant Loyalty in that they were
ready as chearfully to obey their Prince when he was a Papist, as when
they served him in set Battles against the Power of the holy League, and
the majority of his Nobles, and of his Metropolis, and of the chief Citta|dels
in his Realm.
After they saw him go to Mass, they never call'd him Iulian, or Lampoon'd
him in Hymns, or demurred to his Beard, or had any fears or jealousies
of his touching a hair of their heads, nor threatned him that the Galilean
would foil him: and no Language could have more truly expressed their
Sentiments then that of the Famous Pierre du Moulin in his defence of the
Faith, Nous sommes prests d' exposer nos vies pour la defence de nos Rois,
contre qui que ce soit, fust-il de nostre Religion. Quiconque feroit autrement,
ne defendroit point la Religion, mais serviroit son ambition,  attireroit un
grand blame sur la verite de l' evangile. i. e. We are ready to expose our
lives for the defence of our Kings against whomsoever it be, although of our
own Religion. And whosoever should do otherwise, should not defend Religion,
but serve his own ambition, and would draw a great reproach on the truth of
the Gospel. Considering the indeleble Character of Hary the 4ths Prote|stant
Good Nature, his Subjects of that Religion did prepare their thoughts
to be Lachrymists for him, rather then themselves, and knew that by his
Coversion to Popery, if in this life only he had hopes, he was of all men most
miserable, and that his absolution left him only in the State of a Crown'd
Victime.
I have before mentioned the Apology for that Scholar of the Jesuites Iohn
Chastel, which endeavours to prove that Harry the 4th was by that
Assassin not only wounded very fairly according to the Language of the
Brothers of the Blade, but in the Style of their Honour according to the
Iesuites Morals very heroically, and as the Contents of Cap. 1. Part. 3d, of
the Apology expresses it, Actus Castelli heroicus est in substanti
su.
He moreover tells us in plain terms Part. 2. Cap. 7. that Excommunica|tio
quae b haeresim irrogatur, remedium potius est ecclesiae quam excommunica|to,
c. and that Excommunication for Heresie doth quite take away any Regal
Right; And in Cap. 8. before mentioned, (viz. Neque etiam  Papa absolutus
Rex esse potest) he asketh, Quod si quaeratur quid ergo absolutio praestet, si
jus amissum non redeat? And it followeth, Qud si absolutus impaenitens ex|istat,
effectus alius non foret, quam is de quo supra, ita si (quod Deus velit)
paenitentia foret vera, certe effectus propterea non exigus esset futurus: utpote
in spiritualibus, remittendo illum in ecclesiae gremium,  regni Caelorum Capa|cem

reddendo: temporalium vero respectu, quicquid illa operari posset, foret ad
reddendum eum compotem novi juris,  per electionem auferendo impedimen|tum
in foro fori: quo durante is ille esse non posset. And then he saith, The
Pope cannot confer such new Right to the same Kingdom on him, for that it de|pends
not simply on the power of the Keys so to do, and in fine, makes the
Right to the Crown irrevocably devolv'd on the next person capable who
has a right to it, quum (saith he) ratum sit inter jurisconsultos, incapacem
haberi ut mortuum,  non impedire sequentes. In the 3d Chapter of the 2d
Part namely, That Henry of Bourbon cannot be called King by reason of his
pretended Conversion, the vile Apologist derides the Conversion of this Great
King, and labours to prove by fifteen Instances, That after his Conversion he
did favour the Cause of Heresy more then ever, and particularly by his obser|vance
of his Leagues and Agreements with the Queen of England and other
Hereticks, ut experientia (saith he) per novas ejus actiones locupletissime
testatur.
Etenim prim faederum pacta cum haereticis sarta tecta servat: quibus ut
hactenus nondum renunciavit, ita neque dum renunciare cogitat.
Secund ipsi haeritici in Germani, Genevae  alibi ejus actiones compro|bant.
Tertio contemnit Catholicos  promovet haereticos: illos repudiat at re|jicit,
hos ver muneribus honorat amplissimis  augustissimis in toto regno, 
alibi tum bello, tum pace, c.
Quart consilium suum  puris putis haereticis stabilit, c.
So that after he had with St. Peter denied his Lord, the followers of St.
Peter's pretended Successor, call'd him in effect a Galilean, and said that
the Speech of his Actions bewrayed him; and after his absolution he conti|nued
in effect, what the Pope styled him in his Bull of Excommunication,
filius rae, and after as a Prodigal having fed among heretical Swine, he
returned to his Romish Ghostly Fathers house, and had cryed, peccavi, and
abjured, and his Father had compassion on him, he experimented the contrary
to, for this my Son was dead and is alive again, and himself was the fatted
Calf that was slain; and so much wantonness was shewed by the contri|vers
of his dire fate, that Gassendus in his life of Peiresk, Book 2d shews
how in the beginning of the Year 1610. An Almanack or yearly Prognosti|cation
was brought out of Spain, in which the Accidents of Harry the 4ths
death were foretold, and that it was sent to his Majesty to read, who slighted
it, as Gassandus did likewise all judicial Astrology, but yet supposed that
the figure-flinger might possibly be acquainted with the Plot against that
Kings Life: and saith, sure I am it could not be perfectly conceal'd either in
Spain or Italy: for even the Kings Ambassadors and particularly the most ex|cellent
Johannes Bochartus Lord of Champigny then Agent at Venice, had
already preadvertised his Majesty thereof: and it was sufficiently proved that
all the Sea-faring Men of Marseilles who for two Months before came from
Spain, brought word that there was a report spread abroad in Spain, that the
King of France was already or should be killed by a Sword or Knife.
Poor Harry the 4th! He who while a Protestant had Dominion over his
own Stars, and his Enemies Stars too (for they were his Enemies who made
him first be call'd Great, and their designing to ruine him by embroiling
France in Civil Wars tended to the advancement of his Interest and his
Glory, and the Artifices by which they thought to have chased him out
of Guyen brought him into the heart of France, and their former by un|justifiable
practices urging the King his Predecessor, to have prosecuted him
with more violence then he had done, were the causes of his being reconci|led
to that King) and who then in the most dark and stormy night of his

Affairs never wanted that Illumination from above, which was like a
Star to him, and not only a sign of fairer weather, but a mark of directi|on
in the foul, and which would have furnished his Portraiture in Story
with another guess Star than that usually engraved on Coesars Image, and
which by its blazing seven days ore the Games consercrated to Coesar by Au|gustus,
did make him inter Divos, and did awe the World as being thought
his Soul which vouchsafed from Heaven to visit it with its lustre, this
Harry the 4th, was at last grown the ludibrium of Star-gazers.
And if any one shall say that Franciscus de Verona Constantinus the Author
of the Apology for Chastel, was not a Voucher good enough for the spreading
the Belief of the Doctrine, that Heretical Princes by their absolution from
the Pope are not restored to their Regal Rights, let him consult the Great
Thuanus and he will find that in his Book 135, and on the Year 1605 (where
he gives an account of the Gun-powder Treason here) he saith that the Con|spirators
therein, Ante omnia conscientiam instruunt, e instruct ad facinus
audendum obfirmant animum: sic autem  Theologis suis disserebatur. That He|reticks
are yearly excommunicated by the Pope in the bulla coenae, and are
ipso facto, fallen into the punishment of the Law, and that thence it followeth
that Christian Kings if they fall into Heresy, may be deposed, and their Subjects
released immediately from their Princes Dominion, nec jus illud recuperare posse,
etiamsi ecclesiae reconcilentur. Ecclesiam communem omnium parentem cum ne|mini
ad eam redeunti claudere gremium cum dicitur, adhibit distinctione in|terpretandum
esse, modo non (it ad damnum  periculum ecclesiae. Nam id
verum esse quoad animam, non quoad Regnum. Nec solum ad Principes hac
labe infectos paenam extendi, sed etiam ad eorum filios qui  Regni successione ob
vitium paternum pelluntur: haeresim quippe lepram,  morbum haereditarium
esse, atque ut disertius res exprimatur, Regnum amittere qui Romanam Reli|gionem
deserit, diris illum devoveri, nec unquam ipsum aut illius posteros in
Regnum restitui: quoad animam  solo Pontifice posse absolvi. His se ratio|nibus
cum satis tutos intus existimarent, munimenta externa conjurationi quaerere
coeperunt c. ita ad facinus non solum licitum  laudabile, verum etiam me|ritorium
 Theologis suis auctorati accesserunt.
They thought it seems that by the Authority of the Doctrines of those
Divines they might blow up the King and three Estates with Gun-powder
very fairly.
It is a thing that cannot have escaped your Lordships curious Observa|tion,
that both the Nonconformists and Papists were sturdy Petitioners to
King Iames in the beginning of his Reign, that he would be a Fautor to
them and their Hypotheses. In April in the Year 1603, a Petition was pre|sented
to him call'd, the humble Petition of the Ministers of the Church of
England, desiring reformation of certain Ceremonies and Abuses of the Church,
and there they particularly desire, that Ministers may not be urged to sub|scribe
but according to the Law, to the Articles of Religion and the Kings Supre|macy
only, and that none migat be excommunicated without the consent of his
Pastor, and therein they complain of Ministers being suspended, silenced, dis|graced,
imprisoned for Mens traditions.
This Petition was commonly called the Millenary Petition, the Petitioners
averring themselves to be more then a thousand: and an animadverting
Answer was made to the same by the Vice-Chancellor and Doctors, and
Proctors, and Heads of Houses in the Vniversity of Oxford, and printed in
the Year 1604.
Methinks a Humble Petition with a thousand hands is a kind of Contra|dictio
in adjecto. But the Vniversity in their Animadversions on the Peti|tion
do observe that the two contrary Factions of Papists and Puritans did

shew themselves by their Petitions discontented with the present State and
Ecclesiastical Government. They mention particulars as parallels wherein
their Petitions agreed and resemble them to Samsons Foxes, c.
I had occasion before to mention to your Lordship the Supplication of
the Papists to King James, that was Contemporary with that of the Puri|tans,
and printed too in the same year; and tho I remember not any of
our Historians to have given the World an account of that memorable Pe|tition,
yet the Impartial Thuanus doth it: and in Book 135. and on the
Year 1605. going to relate the History of the Gun-powder Treason, he saith,
Ad libellum supplicem pro libertate Conscientiarum  Majorum Religioni ad|dictis
(i. e. the Papists) in proximis Comitiis oblatum,   Rege rejectum,
fama erat, alium his proximis, quae jam aliquoties dilata erant, porrectum iri,
qui non repulsae ut prior, periculum, sed concessionis vel ab invito extrquendae
necessitatem adjunctam haberet. Itaque qui regni negotia sub principe generoso
ac minime suspicioso procurabant, nihil pejus veriti in eo laborabant ut peti|tiones
 iis adjunctam necessitatem eluderent. Verum non de grati, de qu
desperabatur decim obtinend, sed de repuls ill vel cum regni exitio, quod
minime rebantur illi, inter conjuratos agebatur.
And as to the Puritans Petition to King Iames, The Resolution of the
Lords and likewise of the Iudges assembled in Star-Chamber shortly
after, doth I think refer to it in the 3d . viz. Whether it was an offence
punishable and what punishment they deserved, who framed Petitions and Col|lected
a Multitude of Hands thereto to prefer to the King in a publick Cause, as
the Puritans had done with an intimation to the King that if he denied the Suit,
many thousands of his Subjects would be discontented, where to all the Iustices an|swered,
that it was an offence finable at discretion and very near Treason and Felo|ny
in the punishment, for they tended to the raising of Sedition and Rebellion, and
discontent among the People, to which resolution all the Lords declared that
some of the Puritans had raised a false rumour of the King how he intended to
grant a toleration to Papists, c. And the Lords severally declared how the
King was discontented with the said false rumour, and had made but the day
before a Protestation to them that he never intended and would spend the last
drop of Blood before he would do it.
I remember not in the Millenary Petition any such expression as the
insolent intimation, that thousands would be discontented if it were not grant|ed:
but do on the occasion of this ruffianly way of petitioning by Papists
and Puritans, remember what Alexander ab Alexandro speaks of the Per|sians
who worshipped Fire, that they did once in their supplicating their God,
threaten him that if he would not grant their Request they would throw him
into the water.
I was therefore no imprudent Act of the Nonconforming Divines who
had been deprived of their Livings to publish voluntarily such a Protestation
of their Tenets as aforesaid, after the detection of the Papists Gun powder
Treason Plot, and by which Act the Government was diverted from put|ting
such a Cautionary Test on their Party as was on the Papists by the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy.
Certain it is that both the Parties appeared very rude in the manner of
their Petitioning. In the Decrets where the Text saith that a thing is done
Contra fidem Catholicam, the gloss explains it to be Contra bonos mores, and so it
may be said that both the Petitioners for the Roman Catholick Faith, and for
the others alledged Catholick Faith were injurious to each by their unmannerly
Petitionings, as well as to their Prince: and their being both such frequent
Aggressors against his quiet, gave occasion for the Question to vex his Reign,
viz. Which were the worse of the two, or whether they were not equally bad, and so

many may carelessly render them according to the saying, Rustici res secant
per medium.
What Bishop Elmore the Bishop of London thought in such a Case I have
said, and yet that Bishop as Fuller tells us in the Church History, was a Learn|ed
Man and a strict and stout Champion for Disciplin, and on which account
was more mock'd by Mar-Prelate and hated by the Nonconformists then any one.
And a great Son of the Church and Minister of the State, hath judiciously
in a publick Speech inculcated the different regard to be had to those who
stray from the Flock and those who would destroy it. Moreover a great Iusti|tiary
of the Realm, in the Tryal of one of the Popish Plottes, took occa|sion
to observe, That Popery was ten times worse then the Heathen
Idolatry.
And Dr. Burnet in a printed Sermon, having said, That in many places
Lutherans are no less and in some tbey are more fierce against the Calvinists then
against Papists; adds, like a strange sort of People among our selves, that
are not ashamed to own a greater aversion to any sort of Dissenters then to the
Church of Rome. I hope the Authority of that great Divine and excellent
Person will in the point of this Comparison help to allay such a mistaken
Aversion to some mistaken Dissenters. I care not who knows the great
deference I have to the judgment of that great Historian of our Reforma|tion,
and whose History of which as the House of Commons has done right
to by one of their Votes, so likewise hath the highest Judicatory in England,
I mean the House of Lords by a late Order of theirs, by which the Thanks
of that House are given him for the great service done by him to this
Kingdom, and to the Protestant Religion, in writing the History of the Refor|mation
of the Church of England so truly and exactly, and that he be desired to
proceed to the perfecting what he further intends therein with all convenient
speed, c. As the words in the Iournal are.
My reading lately ten small printed Controversial Discourses between two
Baronets of Cheshire near of kin to each other (in which are many references
to Historical Antiquities) concerning the Illegitimacy of one Amicia,
Daughter to one of the Earls of Chester, and my observing that one of
those Authors blames the other for not better learning the duty to his deceased
Grand-mother (as his words are) then by divulging the shame of her Illigiti|macy,
and saith, there is no Precedent in Scripture of any man that did di|vulge
the shame of any person, out of whose loyns he did descend except the
wicked Ham, and that the other Author thinks himself on the account of
truth, and for its sake to assert her Illegitimacy, those many Tracts passed
about that Controversy from the Year 1673 to 1676, occasioned my
thinking that thus have some Writers that would take it ill perhaps not to
be thought legitimate, and true Sons of the Church of England, took too
much pains to prove the Birth of its Reformation to be illegitimate, to the great
Applause of the Papists, and that our Reverend Historian of it, did seasonably
come in to Aid his Mother Church, by publishing the very Records that
would secure her from a blush on that account, and leave that Mauvaise honte
(as the French call it) to be Enemies, and hath appear'd by his very labori|ous
and judicious Writings, to be a Person as of very great Abilities, so of a
great and frank inclination to employ them even to the over-obliging a Coun|try,
and which though naturally attended with envy from some must too be
with acknowledgements from others of that Dignity and Authority that
his mind is possessed of, and such as Valerius Maximus speaking of as
innate in Famous Men who have no extrinsic Authority, saith of it, Quam
rect quis dixerit longum  beatum honorem esse sine honore. And he who
in the course of his History and his other Works hath appear'd so Impartial

and Accurate in his Observations of Men and things, may very well be
supposed not to have been partial in his comparison of Papists and Dissenters,
nor do I think he receded from his usual close judging of things, when in
one of his Books he said, that it is not to be denied that it were better there
were no Revealed Religion in the World, then that Mankind should by its in|fluences
be so vitited as to become more barbarous and cruel then it would be,
if Acted by no higher Principles than those are with which Nature inspires
Men.
I will not with our Learned and Reverend Iudge, undertake to com|pute
how many times Popery is worse then the Religion of the Romans:
but this I will say that had I been in the Roman Senate and had there heard
any one propound to them a removal of their minds out of that Coast
of Religion which by the light of Nature lay open before them, into the
Region of the Iesuites Morals, I would have said, My Masters let us keep
where we are: and should have expected that the Reasons I would have
urged for their so doing, would have had the effect of the good Omen that
happen'd in that remarkable Crisis, when the Roman Senators were debating
whether they should qut Rome or remove to Veij, and when a Souldier then
coming on the Guard, and his Captain being heard to cry out to him, Sig|niser
signum statue, hic optim manebimus, occasioned their adhering to Rome.
I think that no Protestant who compares the Tenets of the Nonconfor|mist
Divines in King Iames's time with the Tenets of Popery, will prefer
the latter before the former. But it is not deniable that before King Iames's
time, and then and since many Puritans and Nonconformists have made
great Schisms in the Church and disturbances in the State, and that espe|cially
in some particular Conjunctures. The great Epoche of 41 in England,
and likewise in Ireland, will in our Histories preserve the Memory of the
outragious Principles of many Presbyterian Divines in the one Kingdom,
and of Popish ones in the other: but if any shall be so partial to the Papists
as either to justify their Commotion in Ireland, or to deny all part of the in|fluence
that Commotion had on ours here, he will find himself a vain impo|ser
on the World.
A great inspector into our modern English Affairs, I mean the late Earl
of Clarendon hath in his Animadversions on Cressys's Book against Dr. Stil|ling
fleet said, That nothing can be stranger then that Mr. Cressy should so
magnify the general obedience of all Roman Catholicks, that none of them was
ever in Rebelion against the King or his Father, when he knows very well and
hath some marks of it, that the whole Irish Nation (very few Persons of Ho|nour
excepted) joyn'd in Rebellion against the King: but for that Rebellion nei|ther
Presbyterian, Independant, or Anabaptists had been able to have done
any harm in England. For the Scots Rebellion was totally suppressed, and
their Army disbanded before the Irish Rebellion begun. It was that which
produced all the mischief that succeeded in England, and gave those Sects in
Religion opportunity to bring in their Confusion to the destruction of Church and
State, c.
But as to the Papists coming in for their share in the guilt of our Com|moion
here, we have the incontestable Authority of the Royal Martyr,
who in one of his printed Declarations saith, And we are confident that a
greater number of that Religion (meaning the Popish) is in the Army of
the Rebels then in our own, and 'twas there before said, All men know the great
number of Papists which serve in their Army, Commanders and others.
The Author of the Regal Apology printed in the Year 48, in p. 36, an|swereth
that part of the Declaration of the House of Commons, that so un|worthily
rflects on his Majesty, as to offering a toleration to the Papists in

Ireland, tontrary to his former resolutions, which saith the Author,
was on great and pressing necessity which hath no Law, and to that degree of
necessity as the two Houses had driven him, so the Consequences were to be set on
their Score not his own, yet even then in his Letters about that Affairs pub|lished
by themselves, he doth insist on it that the Bargain may be made as good
as can be for him. But I have seen other Letters from one of his Secretaries
to the Irish, which I am assured were true, wherein where these expressions
after expostulation of their delays in his Assistance, He is inform'd that ta|king
advantage of his low Condition, you insist on something in Religion more
then formerly you were contented with. He hath therefore commanded me to
let you know that were his Condition much lower, you shall never force him to
any further Concessions to the prejudice of his Conscience and of the true Pro|testant
Religion in which he is resolved to live, and for which he is ready to
die; and that he will joyn with any Protestant Prince, nay with these Rebels
themselves how odious soever (meaning his two Houses) rather then yield
the least to you in this particular.
I should with extreme reluctance touch the Sores of these Sects who yet
have both at several times given such deadly wounds to the peace of the
Kingdom, but that they are Nusances to the publick quiet in raking up the
odious Comparisons of one anothers practices, and that the Papists on the
occasion of any of the worse sort of Protestants or Nonconformists being
Convicted of Sedition or Treason (a thing that may be expected from
the degeneracy of Humane Nature to happen oftener from some of a Re|ligion
of so great Numbers, then from a perswasion that has Comparative|ly
but a handful of men for its Disciples, just as accordingly perhaps where
one Papist is hanged for Clipping or Coyning twenty Protestants are so 
are so apt to expect that the World should acquit the present Princi|ples
and former practises of that Sect from Disloyalty on their Out-cry
that they are no Puritans or Presbyterians, and as ridiculously as if a false
Coyner Arraigned for the Fact, should trouble the Court with a Plea and
Noise, that he was no House-breaker, and but that on the detection of a
Plot of Papists, several persons that have in their publick Capacities done
many Acts of Hostility to the Interest of the Kingdom, yet entirely by
being more busie Anti-Papists then others, have been immediately admit|ted
to the good Graces of the People, and cried up by them as Patriots
and Hero's, and by their afterward espousing the true Interest of the King|dom
as to the point of Popery, all their former spurious Actions have been
not only pardoned, but almost according to the Canon Law legitimated;
and as the Popes in any Croysad for the Exterminium of Hereticks were
wont to give plenary Indulgences for all Sins past and to come for many
years, so have the People heaped such Indulgences on such Persons that in
any Conjuncture shewed their zeal in the extermination of Popery.
And though to an ordinary view these mens Title to their Fame may ap|pear
by some of their former Actings much incumbered, yet who ever pryes
into it is as much generaly hated as are those Projectors, who rake for their
Bread among the weak Titles of other Mens Estates, and cry out  when
they have found out a flaw there.
'Tis observable that S. Iames C. 2. in his Assertion of Justification by
works, gives two Instances of Persons so justified, and that one is of Abra|ham,
and the other of Rahab the Harlot, in v. 25. likewise also was not
Rahab the Harlot justified by workt, when she had received the Messengers,
and had sent them another way: and yet too that sen the Spies another
way as the Fact is Historically mentioned in Ioshua the 2d, would to some
Scruplers seem unjustifiable. Thus do the People in their way justifie all

that they believe are assistful to them in the attaquing of the Romish Baby|lon,
and look on them as their Saviours, and as captious as they are against
others, yet think of nothing but saving them and all that they have; as was
in the case of Rahab.
Nor is it to be wonder'd at that Men who have so much to account for
to the Public should be thus discharged by the populace, tho many of
them are Gallios in Religion, and were no more concern'd for the Eclipse
of Protestancy or the light of the Gospel in the year 1678. or 1680. then
they were for the four Eclipses of the Luminaries, viz. two of the Sun, and
two of the Moon, that will be in the year 1701. and particularly of that
of the Sun, which will be in Ianuary then and not seen by us, but only by
our Antipodes; but there is that adherent to Popery, that if it could rivet it
self into our Law here, it would make the light of the Sun not worth the
looking on, namely the Confiscation of the Goods and Estates of those that
Holy Church calls Heretics, and the throwing them into such forlorn Pri|sons
where they could see neither Sun or Moon: and therefore as the De|vils
those Seducers in Chains are hated by Men, because they know those
Fiends would destroy their lifes if they could; for the same reason all that
lye open to the Name of Heretics, will be animated with a brisk hatred
against Popery, and magnify those as their tutelar Angels that shall pre|tend
to defend them from it; tho such did before conspire against them.
But therefore because a Zeal against Popery is a remedy so cheap and so
easie to be had, and yet so infallible a one against the Peoples being discon|tented
with Men who did before so much by their Principles poison the
Realm, 'tis the common interest of us all, both Protestants and Papists, out
of love to our Country, to wish that no Men may be tempted so fatally to
injure it hereafter, by being beforehand sure of purchasing both Pardon
and Adoration, from the People on such easie terms.
The strong currents of Inclination I find in my self, and observe in others,
not only to Pardon, but to extol and magnifie, nay to bless all Men that
help their Country, as it is contesting with Popery or Presbytery, or either
of those or any Religion-trade, and to say to them as the Expression is in
the Psalms, We bless you in the name of the Lord, will I hope be accompa|ny'd
with such an Extirpation of it as will not leave any Fibre behind it in
our English World.
As it need not be told to our Divines of the Church of England, that
they are under no obligation to strain any point of Courtesie whereby to
render the Papists generally not worse than Puritans, and that their Cha|racter
hath been by the Papists all along render'd more vile than that of
the Puritans, and that Doleman in his Book of the Succession, weighing the
Parties in England, and having first spoke of the Protestants of the Church
of England, afterward p. 242. saith, That the Puritan party is more gene|rally
favour'd throughout the whole Realm, with all those which are not of the
Roman Religion, then is the Protestant upon a certain general persuasion that
the profession of the Puritan Party is the more perfect, especially in great
Towns, where Preachers have made more impression in the Artificers and Bur|gesses,
than in the Common People. And among the Protestants themselves;
all those that are less interested in Ecclesiastical Livings, or other Preferments
depending on the State, are more affected commonly to the Puritans, c.
And p. 244. The Puritan Party at home in England is thought to be most
vigorous of any other; that is to say, most ardent, quick, bold, resolute
and to have a great part of the best Captains and Soldiers on their side;
which is a point of no small moment; and that Weston, Lib. 3. de Trip.
Hom. Offic. Cap. 16. p. 226. in a very janty manner, crying up the Puritans

beyond the Prrotestants of the Church of England, saith Protestantibus in
Sacr praestabiliores puritanos. Qui enim estis Protestantes, hominum judi|camini
ignavissimi omnium, religionis etiam fuco destituti, impiissimi aerusca|tores,
parati jurare in cujusvis verba, mod inde emolumentum rebus ve|stris
accrescat, and in p. 227. Puritani sane mult solidius ac syncerius sua
dogmata profitentur; So neither need it be told the Papists that the Divines
of the Church of England did never prefer the Tenets of Popery, or Profes|sors
thereof to those of Puritanism or Presbytery as such, and that they ne|ver
complain'd of the Protection the Dutch and French Churches have long
here enjoy'd with Liberty to worship God according to their peculiar Rites
and Church Discipline, and that upon the late great migration of many
French Protestants from their own Country hither, under great Circum|stances
of want, our Divines, and particularly those in and near London,
shew'd all the efforts of their Art of Persuasion from their Pulpits to move
their Hearers to liberal Contributions to them, that they could have possi|bly
done in the case of their own Countrimen or Kindred; and that one of
those Divines in one of the greatest Cures there being for his Learning and
Life and Endowments proper to his Function a great Ornament to the Gos|pel,
when he with great Eloquence so pathetically bespoke the Relief of
his Great Auditory for those poor Hugonots, did characterize them as such
of whom none was ever suspected to have machinated any thing against their
King's Person or Government, or to have attempted the burning of his Me|tropolis.
I have granted that the Puritan and the Popish Petitioners did both in
the beginning of King Iames his Reign offend Contra bonos mores: but if
any should ask me which Sect was the more peccant by such incivility, I
will say that in one regard the Puritans were so, for that they were bred
to the Knowledge of better things: but that in another regard the Papists
most certainly were so, if Thuanus may be believ'd, who in the place I last
cited out of him, relating to the Gun-powder Plot, (by which it appears
that their Petitioning was but a stalking-horse, or as I may say, a Trojan
Horse to hide and enclose armed Men) further shews, That the Iesuites in
England employ'd one privately into Spain in the Name of the Catholics with
Letters of Commendation to Creswell the Iesuite there residing, to negotiate
with the Government there, to send an Army into England in the latter end
of Queen Elizabeth's Reign, and that afterward one Wright was sent into
Spain upon the same Errand, and that then likewise Guy Faux was by some
of the Iesuites sent thither to Creswel to hasten the Design, and that Faux
was instructed to take Care that it should be signify'd to the King of Spain, that
the Condition of the Roman Catholics would be worse here under King James
than it was under Queen Elizabeth, and that it might be effected that Spinola
should then Land an Army in Milford Haven. And then saith the great
Historian, they not being able to effect that, proceeded to the Plot of the
Gun-powder Treason.
The Popish Petitioners then did essay how they might flectere superos and
Acheronta movere at the same time.
But in truth, as in Whale-fishing, 'tis customary for Marriners apprehen|ding
Danger to the Vessel from the greatness of the Whale, to throw out an
empty Barrel into the Sea, for the Whale to toss about on the Waters, and
to receive some diversion from it, that while he is so diverted, they may
the more securely wound him with their dead-doing Irons, thus did the
Papists throw out their empty Petitions to that King only to divert
and amuse him, that they might surprize him with the ate they inten|ded
him.

Yet now if any one should put the Interrogatory to me, which Person I
had the least Kindness for, namely, a Non-Conformist that favour'd the
Doctrine of Resistance, or a Papist that believ'd the Grounds and School-Conclusions
of the Doctrine of Popery, as King Iames's before mention'd
Expression was (and which whoever did, he said, could neither be a good
Christian or a faithful Subject) I shall by way of Answer crave aid from a
Judgment given by Philip of Macedon, who having heard the Merits of a
Cause or Complaint that happen'd between two lewd Persons, gave the
Decree, That one of them should presently fly out of Macedon, and that the
other should run after him as fast as he could.
But against any Seditious Protestant, I would wish more severity exer|cised
than against such a Papist: for the former doth not only rebel against
his Prince as the latter; but doth according to Iob's Expression, more rebel
against the light: and is guilty of the Simulata Sanctitas, and so accor|ding
to the Expression before mention'd out of the Apocalypse, Reward her
as she has rewarded you, and double unto her double, c. deserves to be dou|bly
punish'd for his duplex iniquitas, and shall magnifie the Justice of the
King's Ministers done to their Prince and Country, and to themselves,
when in any Conjuncture they shall find any call'd Protestants turning Gods
and the King's grace into wantonness, and Religion, into Rebellion, they shall
level their most solicitous endeavors with all the sharpness of the Law
against such nominal Protestants; for then the salus populi will engage
them as the Physicians say, to mind the Vrgentius Symptoma, and for which
they have a Rule, that Cum diversae repugnantes inter se committuntur in|dicationes,
parendum est omnino fortioribus.
'Tis fit I should recompence the trouble I have given your Lordship by
what I have said of this Question by diverting you with the News of ano|ther
Question, that among some Company was lately bandy'd in Discourse
here, between a Papist and a Non-Conformist (and 'twas a much more
termagant Question than the former) namely, Whether Popery or Mahu|metanism
be the wost? I was sorry to find the Non-Conformist to give his
Judgment as he did in a gross and undistinguishing manner, that the Im|postures
of Mahomet were fitter to be embraced than several Tenets he
named in Popery, which tho erroneous, yet are denominable as Tenets of
Religion; but did for a while forbear giving my Opinion in the Case or re|lieving
the Papist with any notion of mine, tho I found the Non-Conformist
as somewhat the better Disputant pressing too hard on him, gave me occasion
to have done it, than if I would.
I calling to mind how the Papists of old have so often decided it, that He|retics
are wose than Turks or Infidels, and that they have ranked our Reli|gion
of the Church of England with Atheism, since I allow not of works of
super-erogation, would not super-erogate in being too hasty in moderating
in the Dispute.
Thus Maldonae on St. Iohn, saith, Qui Catholici sunt Majore odio Calvi|nistas
caeteros omnes Haereticos prosequuntur quam Gentiles. And thus
Stapleton in his Oration or Speech against the Politicians, saith, That the
Heretics are worse than Turks. And Mason in his Vindiciae Ecclesiae An|glicanae,
Lib. 1. Cap. 1. p. 8. cites Gulielm. Reinold. in his Calv. Turcis.
l. 1. c. 7. and l. 4. c. 11. for saying Religionem nostram (meaning that of
the Church of England) ips Turcic esse deteriorem. Mason further
brings in Bristo, saying Religionem nostram nullam esse ips Experienti
probri: And cites another Popish Author for saying Protestantes nullam
habent fidem, nullam Spem, nullam Charitatem, nullam Poenitentiam, nullam
Iustificationem, nullam Ecclesiam, nullum Altare, nullum Sacrificium, nullum

Sacerdotium, nullam Religionem, Christum nullum, and quotes Cardinal
Alan for saying, Nostram liturgiam, sacramenta  Conciones istiusmodi esse,
quae fine dulio aeternum afferunt exitium.
The well meant pains of the Compilers of our Liturgy in inserting
there some good Prayers out of the Mass, to render it more agreeable to
the Papists, was it seems all lost; and that perhaps occasion'd that angry
Exclamation of Mr. Cartwright of old, That in Ceremonies we ought to
comply with the Turk rather then the Pope.
I acquainted the Discoursers that Mr. Fox in the Edition of the Acts and
Monuments printed together in one Volume in London, in the Year 1596,
doth Combat this mighty Question in p. 702, and in the following Pages,
viz. Whether the Turk or the Pope is the greater Antichrist, and at last
saith p. 710. In comparing the Turk with the Pope if a Question be asked
whether of them is the truer or greater Antichrist, it were easie to see and
judge that the Turk is the more open and manifest Enemy against Christ and
the Church. But if it be asked whether of them two hath been the more
bloody and pernicious Adversary to Christ and his Members, or whether of
them hath Consumed and Spilt more Christian Blood, he with Sword or this
with Fire and Sword together, neitheer is it a light matter to discern, neither
is it my part here to discuss, who do only write the History and Acts of them
both.
And I then telling the Nonconformist that the Iews for many obvious
reasons did prefer the Doctrine of Mahumetanisme to that of Popery, some
Papists beforemention'd had prefer'd it to Protestancy, and as he the Non|conformist
had preferred it to Popery, he mention'd his fears that a sort of
Enthusiasts among us called Seekers, might hereby be in great danger of
stumbling on the Religion of Mahumetanisme, accordingly as of old when
one went to demand of the Philosophers of the several Sects, which was the
best of them, every one named his own Sect or Party in the first place, but
all of them in the second place granted Plato to be the most eminent, that
is the next best: whereupon those Seekers preferred Plato, because setting
aside prejudicate Affection and Self-Love, Plato's Philosophy had thus car|ried
the Garland.
I then took occasion to tell the Company that I thought 'twas extreme|ly
unjust to prefer Mahumetanisme with the many ridiculous and senseless
things it comprehends to Christianity in Papists, blended with many er|roneous
Tenets which yet are capable of the name of Religion, and such as
those great pious Papists beforementioned, viz. Father Paul, Thuanus, D'Ossat,
Erasmus, Peiresk perhaps own'd the belief of, as many thousands of others
may still likewise do: but frankly interposed my opinion that I thought
that Popery complicated with the real belief of the Iesuites Morals, and their
vile Casuistical Tenets branded by the present Pope, was as unworthy of
God and Humane Nature as any Hypothesis of Religion could be: and
I as frankly told the Nonconformist whom I looked on as one who would not
outrage the Law of the Land to advance the Gospel, that tho some erro|neous
points relating to Nonconformity, might without absurdity assume
the name of Religion, yet among whomsoever those Tenets should be in|corporated
with the real belief and practice of the lawfulness of the Do|ctrine
of Resistance, and of any persons Reforming the World by Arms with|out
Warrant from the Municipal Laws so to do, yet such a Faith would be
Faction, and such a Nominal Religion would be a real Rebellion, and much
worse then Mahumetanisme.
I farther acquainted the Company that according to the discreet Motto
of the House of Ormond, Comm je trouve, and the Mode of the Age to take

the measures of knowledge by experiment, the usage that the better sort
of Christians have found under Turcisme hath been by very many de|grees
milder then under Popery. Erasmus indeed was of a contrary opi|nion,
for in his Vtilissima Consultatio de ello Turcis inferendo, printed in
the Year 1530, he saith that Exaudiuntur interim   voces abo|minandae
qui jactant esse tolerabilius agere sub imperio Turcor, quam sub
Christianis Principibus ac sub Pontifice Romano, and there he goes on at
large to prove the inconvenience of living under the Turkish Government:
but the order of the Iesuites was not then invented, and after a hundred
years observation since, Protestants have judged as they did in Erasmus
his time.
And in a Popish Book called the Right of the Prelate and the Prince, I
find Luther, de soecul. potestat. cited p. 55. for saying that the Turk is de|cies
probior, prudentior nostris principibus. And I think it may seem great|er
wisdom in him to sell such Heterodox People for slaves that he takes by
force, than to burn them.
But in the Year before that Book of Erasmus was printed, I find in Ma|gerus
his Advocatia Armata, Laurent. Surius in Comment. rer. in orbe gestar.
ad annum 1529, cited for the Hungarians throwing themselves on the pro|tection
of the Turk, rather then they would be deprived of their Right to
chuse their King: and it seems under Popery in that Kingdom they had a
greater kindness for the Turk then the Emperor of Germany.
And the great Observer Thuanus on the Year 1597 in his 3d Tome, dis|coursing
how the Germans being under apprehensions of the Power of the
Turk and of Spain at the same time, were thoughtfully weighing their
danger, Et Comparatione Alchorani cum inquiitione Hispaniensi fact, an po|tius
cum Orientali quam occidentali Turco sibi rem esse velint, thereupon
saith,  si quidem res merito suo, ac semoto omni affectu privato aestimetur,
haud dubium esse quin, optione dat, orientalem eligant, quippe ut viribus prae|pollentem,
sic victis tolerabiliorem faturum, c.
Dr. Heylin likewise seems to favour that opinion for in his Geoghraphy in
Folio, he saith, The Turks compel no man to abjure the faith in which he was
born. I have heard many say that 'tis better for a man that would enjoy
Liberty of Conscience, to live in the Countries professing Mahumetanism than Pa|pistry.
And I think I have read it in the Author of the Zealanders Choice, that if
he were to lay the Scene of his life any where with respect chiefly to the
freedom of owning any Religious Sentiments, it should be either in Am|sterdam
or Constantinople.
As I was reading the other day in an old Canonists Tractate of Heresy,
I found this Position asserted there, that 'tis unlawful for a Master of Re|quests
to deliver a Petition for Mercy to be shown to a Heretic; but then I oc|casionally
thought of a more manly and god-like temper shining in part of
the Alcoran, as Mr. Gregory relates it in his Opusc. where he saith, The Ma|humetans
have another Lords Prayer called by them, the Prayer of Jesus the
Son of Mary, and that endeth thus, And let not such an one bear rule over
me that will have no mercy on me, for thy mercies sake, O thou most merci|ful.
He who separates Mercy from Justice, is unjust to the very name of
Justice, and robbeth it of the better half of its signification, leaving its
Teeth and Claws, and taking away its Heart and Bowels.
Iarchas the Indian and chief of the Brachmans, in Philostratus, is brought in
finding fault with Apollonius Tyaneus and others of the Greeks, for that they
confined and applied the word  to those only who do no wrong to

one another and telling them that they were in an error: for saith he among
the chiefest Offices of Iustice,   Bounty and Goodness, to|gether
with , ought to be reckoned up. And  ,
just and kind men are convertible terms in Aristophanes, and joyn'd both
together i Plarch: and Aristotle saith,  Moderation or Clemency
is , a piece of Iustice better then all Iustice. And if
a man would not wish his Soul, yet he would his Body among Heathens of
that temper, or Mahumetans, rather then such fiery Canonists.
There was one thing that I told the Gentleman, who was the Papist, in
the Close of this Discourse that much surprized him, namely; that those
two Anti-Christs, the Turk and the Pope have sometimes held a good Cor|respondence
together, and that the Pope has been a Pensioner to the
Turk.
King Iames in his Apology for the Oath of Allegiance doth in p. 74 mention
how Alexander the 6th, took of Bajazet two hundred thousand Crowns to kill
his Brother Gemen, or as some call him Sisimus whom he held Captive at
Rome, and how he accepted of his Conditions to poyson the Man and had his
pay.
King Iames voucheth for the History of this Fact Paul. Iovius, and
Guicciardine, and Cuspinian. It was a vile Ministry to the Turk that that
pretended Vicar of Christ then engaged in. King Iames mentions not
there how that Popes predecessor, Innocent the 8th, was likewise Bajazets
Pensioner in the same detestable Affair: for 'twas in his time that Sisimus
having rebell'd against his Brother and retired to Rhodes, was brought to
that Pope to whom Bajazet sent the Title of our blessed Saviours Cross in
Hebrew, Greek and Latin, as a present, and effectually obliged him to de|tain
his Brother in Custody during his Pontificat: and that Pope had a
yearly Pension of 40,000 Ducats from the Turk for the continuing his
Brother a Prisoner; and it seems that Charles the 8th King of France, ma|king
War against Pope Alexander who was not able to resist him, the Pope
was constrained to conclude a Peace, and one Condition was that he should
set the Turks Brother at liberty. But then his Holiness being thereby to
lose the said yearly Pension of 40,000 Ducats, received from the Turk
the gracious offer of 20,0000 Crowns to cause Geme or Zizimus to be poy|soned,
and so he was. These faults are particularly set down in Cyprian
Valera of the lives of the Popes, writ in Spanish, and translated into En|glish
by Iohn Golbourne, and printed at London, Anno 1600, Pag. 130, 131,
136. and many other Popish Writers accord herewith, and particularly
Sabellicus, Tome 2d, of his Works, Ennead. 10. Book 9, says that Bajazet
promised that Pope, Magnam auri vim si fratrem veneno tolleret, and that
fuerunt qui crederent cum veneno sublatum, fuisse Alexandrum pontificem
ejus consilii non ignarum, p. 781. ib. King Iames in p. 74. of that Apology
mentions another of Christs Vicars, namely, Alexander the 3d, that writ
to the Soldan, that if he would live quietly he should by some slight, murther
the Emperor, and to that end sent him the Emperors Picture.
That Emperor, King Iames, says was Frederick Barbarossa: and it seems
to have been extraordinary ill nature, in that Pope Alexander after he had
not without ridiculing that piece of Scripture, Conculcabis leonem  draco|nem,
trampled on that Emperors neck, to write to the Pope to cut his
Throat.
And that the Greek Church refusing to submit to the Pope was betrayed
by him, to the Turk is a thing enough known, as it likewise is that the Pope
has often effected it, that Arms raised in Christendom against the Turk,
should be employed against Heretics. I believe there is none thinks that

the Pope by all the Treasures that the Souls or Sins of any Christians
yield him, could have hired the Turk, so far to have degenerated from Na|tural
Conscience as to practice any base Art of killing the body of any of
his Vassals, contrary to the Law of his Prophet or of the Empire: and I
acount nothing more ridiculous than to believe that the Grand Seignior
doth employ for his Spies in the Europaean World, a wretched sort of
Mankind that appear within the Class of Monsters, and are call'd by the
Italian and German Writers of Politics Cingari and by the Spanish Hittani,
and the French Egyptii, and by our People Gypsies, and who are foolishly
imagined by any to have come from Egypt, and more foolishly by Rein|kingk
de Regim. Saecul. Eccles. lib. 2. class. 1. cap. 7. n. 10. and the gene|rality
of the Grave Political Authors to be exploratores  proditores qui
Germanorum consilia  negotia Turcis produnt, and he saith further, nulla
in imperio securitate gaudent, sed impune  quovis offendi possunt.
Magerus de Advocati armata, p. 299. saith of them, Nihil aliud sunt quam
manipulus furum  colluvies pessima otiosorum  fraudulentorum hominum ex
variis nationibus non ita remotis, sed vicinis collecta, qui extra civitates in
agris, in triviis tentoria erigentes, proditionibus, latrociniis  furtis, decep|tionbus
 permutationibus, at ex chiromantic oblectantes homines, iis frau|dibus
victum mendicant: but renders them no Commissaries or Spies
for the Grand Seignior, or Correspondents with his Visier, and saith, that
Nonnullorum magistratuum animos vana superstitio velut lethargia adeo invase|rit,
ut hoc hominum genus violare nefas putent, eos grassari  furari  sub|ditis
imponere passim impune sinunt. And if not only Magistrates but pri|vate
persons too spare them (for according to Reinkingk every man is a
Magistrate against them) 'tis anIndicium that they are but inconsiderable
Extravagants in the World: and 'tis therefore I think pity that our Learn|ed
Country-man Brown in his vulgar errors, where he shews the error of
their being thought to come from Egypt, doth yet represent them as Spies
employed by the Grand Seignior.
I shall here observe to your Lordship one thing that occurred to me not
without sharp regret, and that is, that I read lately in the Works of Crack|anthorp,
one of the most learned men in Oxford in his time, and a most
faithful Citer of Authors, the famous Hosius of the Church of Rome cited
for a more intolerable Blasphemy against the holy Iesus, then any I re|member
in the Alcoran.
Crackanthorp arming his Logick against the errors of Popery doth in his
Chapter, De loco arguendi ab authoritate, say, that, ipsi primarii sacerdotes
quos maxim ab errore immunes fecit Mosis Cathedra  promissio illa Dei
(Math. 26. 65.) Ipsi indicabunt tibi judicii veritatem, illi inquam Christum
blasphemasse,  reum mortis esse judicarunt. Pudeat vos Hosii vestri, cujus
haec sunt verba (Hos. lib. 2. Con. Brent. fol. 54.) Veritas indicii hic judi|cata,
vera sententia hic pronuntiata fuit. Quaenam illa? Reus est mortis.
Hanc sententiam  spiritu sancto profectam esse non est dubium. O hominem
sacrilegum  blasphemum! Ille ne Reus mortis, qui innocens  innoxius vi|tam
dedit?
But as inhumane as any Principles of Papists or Mahumetans, or
any Enthusiasts, or as desperate as the very Iesuites beforementioned ones
are supposeable to be, and as much as any of Mankind can strive to delude
others by Implicit Faith, yet as it is in no mans power presently to believe
what even his own, and much less what his Guides appetite would have
him, notwithstanding any Ecclesiastical Association he may have prosessed|ly
linked his Faith in; so no man can ensure the continuance of his Belief
or its holding for a Moment: and therefore the more absurd and inhu|mane

any mens Tenets are, I shall expect them to be the less believed, and
for the less time, and it is more then Holy Church can know that any one
at all believes as it believes, how great soever the number that pretends so to
do, appears.
Of all Papists not professing themselves bound to withdraw their Alle|giance
from Heretical Princes, and even from such as by a particular Bull
were Excommunicated by the Pope, History affords many Examples,
and particularly of the many Loyal Papists, who when the inheritable Right
of the Crown of France was devolved on the King of Navarre, a Prote|stant,
and as such Excommunicated, with their Lives and Fortunes asserted
his Title to the Crown. Any of the Readers of Thuanus know that in
Book 93 'tis related, how when many Papists would have debarred him
from the Succession, and that the minds of those qui in Castris erant, were
in that point variously affected, yet Major  sanior pars sic existimabat
nullam publicae salutis spem superesse, nisi servato legitimae successionis ordine,
and so were for Harry the 4ths Right therein, and whom they believed
was late reconciled to the King his Predecessor for that he did per eum res
administrare as the Historian's words are, i. e. Harry the 4th a Protestant
Successor, was Primier Ministre to Harry the 3d a Papist.
And not only the Major part and the sober Party of the Popish Souldiery,
(i. e. in Thuanus his words sanior pars) was loyally addicted to the Right of
the Protestant Successor, but several of the Grandees of the Popish Clergy
were so, and particularly the Arch-Bishop, whose Speech for that purpose
Thuanus Book 106. sets down, wherein 'tis said, Neque ver aut Regis per|sonam,
aut subditorum robur debilitatemque heic considerandum esse, quando Re|ges
lege ad regnum vocantur. Neque exemplis doceri posse quicquid contraja|ctetur,
in prisc lege populum Israeliticum ob Religionem regibus suis defecisse,
c. sed totum id Deo dijudicandum reliquisse, in cujus manibus regum corda
sunt, quae  ille pro arbitrio quo vult, inclinat. Quid in Christian Ecclesi?
Nonne Christum generis humani redemptorem ejus beatissimam matrem nomina
sua apud censum, Augusto imperante, Gentilium sacris addicto professos esse?
Nonne Caesari suo  Petri nomine tributum pependisse? Quod ver de legibus
civilibus  imperialibus constitut affertur quibus Manichaei  Arriani  dig|nitatum,
magistratuum ac publicorum munerum participatione excluduntur, id
intelligi de magistratibus inferioribus, non de principalibus, qui nisi cum exci|dio
populorum  Reip. eversione jure suo privari non possunt, de quibus decer|nere
ad solius Dei Omnipotentis Iurisdictionem pertinet. The whole Speech
is argumentative to that purpose out of the old and new Testament and Fa|thers,
c. and that Noble Loyalty of those Papists to a Protestant Succes|sor
met with a requital as to their Religion, and thereby I may say in the
Scripture expression that they did at once heap both a Crown and Coals of
Fire upon his head.
Any one may be rather apt to think me less sanguine (as I may say) in
my belief of Shame's operating more and more among both Lay and Cleri|cal
Roman Catholicks, and even among our Jesuited Protestants (I mean
many of our Non-Conformists that have had sanguinary and disloyal Prin|ciples
transfused into them by Jesuites,) to the making them out of love
with such Principles, when he shall consider how the ingenious Maimbourg
doth in the 6th Book of his History of Calvinisme reflect on the great Cal|vin
for his opinion and practice relating to the punishment of Heretics with
death, and instanceth in the Case of Servetus who was burn'd by the Ma|gistrates
of Geneva as an Heretick, on Calvin's instigating them so to deal
with him, as Maimbourg tells us, and concludes his Historical Ac|count
of the Parisian Massacre, with the mention of the said opinion and

practice of Calvin, and doth with great Judgment and Candour thus ob|serve,
viz. On  veu neanmoins de tout temps que le moyen le plus efficace quand
l' heresie est deja puissamment etablie, n' estoient point les supplices, beaucoup
moins la violence  le trop de Rigueur. Bien loin que le massacre qu' on fit a
Paris  entant d' autres villes ait aneanti, ou du moins affoibli le Calvinisme,
qu' au Contraire il en devint plus enracin, plus puissant  plus formidable, qu'
auparavant. Les Huguenots ne voulurent plus se fier aux declarations que l' on
fit pur les rasleurer, c.
Alsted in his Chronology of Heresy tells us that Michael Servetus His|panus
docuit nullam esse in Deo realem generationem aut distinctionem: and
Calvin in his Opuscula saith of Servetus, vel sola modestia potuisset vitam re|dimere:
but I believe the World will grow more modest then to burn
men for immodesty: and 'tis most certain that as the World grows the
nearer to its Period and growing more and more populous, that populous|ness
will naturally tend to unite all Countries at home by preparing them
to resist Invasion from abroad, and make the fantastical squandring away the
Members of the Common-wealth more and more ridiculous and insensi|bly
to grow out of fashion.
Thus 'twas with the increase of the People among the Jews and Turks,
that the Sicacious Zealots among the former, and Dervices among the lat|ter
did gradually decrease, and at last insensibly grew obsolete.
And thus of old did Draco's Laws evaporate, Aulus Gellius tells us in
his Noctes Atticae, that Draco Atheniensis vir bonus multque esse prudentia
existimatus est: juris divini  humani peritus fuit. Is Draco leges quibus
Athenienses uterentur primus omnium tulit. In illis legibus furem cujuscun|que
modi furti supplicio capitis puniendum esse,  alia plera nimis severe
censuit, sanxitque. Ejus igitur leges quoniam videbantur impendio acerbiores,
non decreto jusso sed tacito illeterato Atheniensium consensu obliteratae sunt.
And this I believe would have been the fate of the sicarious Morality of
the Jesuites although this present Pope had not exposed their Principles as
he has done, and their Consecrastis manus Iehovae be absolete, how
much soever many of them think to out-brave the Popes Decree, who I
wonder that they are not so hardy to write to the Pope to revoke it, in
the comtemptuous Style of Merbizan the Turk, that when Pius the 2d
published a Bull wherein he granted Indulgences to all them that would
bear Arms against him, writ a Letter to his Holyness willing and requi|ring
him to call in his Epigramms again, (as Dr. Donne relates it, citing
the Historiae  alia impressa ante Alcoran. f. 99.) and in the Style of
Casaubon calling Paul the 5ths Excommunication against the Venetians, di|rum
carmen, a cruel Lampoon.
Dr. Peter du Moulin in a Discourse of his, printed in the Year 1675.
saith, that the Iesuites were then i. e. in the time of the late Usurpation,
and are now the principal directors of the Consciences of the English Papists.
And there was published in the Year 1662, a Pamphlet writ by a Person
of no vulgar understanding, and who I suppose was a Papist, and the
Title of it was an expedient or a sure and easie way of reducing all Dissenters
c. wherein the Author saith, of the Papists (meaning in England and
Wales) there are 7 Parts of 10, Gentlemen and People of great Quality:
and therefore since the Jesuites have formerly made the Pope infallible in his
judgment of matter of Fact, and that the Pope hath thus de facto thrown
that turpitude of their Principles (that one may call lutum sanguine mace|ratum)
from his Court and even from that of the Roman Inquisition, and
the Sordes whereof Gentlemen could never receive into the Cabinets of
their mind without fear and shame, they must now either be ashamed of

their Jesuitical Guides, or of their Pope, and the more ingenious and mo|dest
sort of Jesuites will by natural instinct be more and more ashamed of
such Principles, and be sometimes pale with fear, and sometimes red with the
Die of Blushes, as they observe the World picqued with their Dishonour
pronounce against them as the Pope their infallible Censor hath done, and
the Jesuites see that the Principles are too hot for them to touch where
there is an Inquisition and too foul where there is none.
According to that great Moral Observation of Tertullian's, Omne malum
aut timore aut pudore natura perfudit, all the fair-killing Principles of the Jesu|ites
and particularly those refer'd to in the 13th, 14th, 15th, 30th, 32d Tenets
in the Pope's Decree, must really appear foul, and as too foul play to be used in
our populous English World.
Time was in the old Monastic days when the Popish Clerical Actors
were so numerous on the Stage of the World and so rich, and the Specta|tors
so few and so poor, that it was dangerous for these to his at them or
not to applaud them, but 'tis now otherwise, and the Scene of
Time is altered.
The Tables are turned since the Author of a Popish Book called, The
Right and Iurisdiction of the Prelate and the Prince, imprinted with licence
of Superiors, Anno Dom. 1617 was so hardy as in Chap. 15th, p. 269. ha|ving
spoke of the Oath of Allegiance, to say, The King after this Oath is
no more secure than before, because the Catholicks who take this Oath against
their Conscience, know that they are not bound to keep their Oath. Yea the
Prince thereby bringeth himself into greater danger, for by so unwonted and odi|ous
an Oath so contrary to his Subjects Consciences, he cannot but make himself
odious, and there having insinuated the great numbers of the Papists, to
apply then very gravely to his Prince that saying of Cicero in his Offices,
Multorum odiis nullae opes, nullae vires resistere queunt: and that Author
further tells us out of Tully, quem metuunt oderunt. Men hate whom they
fear: and then doth like a grave Animal thus proceed very honestly telling
us, And what security hath a Prince among them that hate him? when Sub|jects
hate their Prince, they are discontented; when they are discontented they are
desperate; when they are desperate, they care not for their own lives; when
they care not for their own lives, let then the Prince fear his; for as Seneca
saith, Qui suam vitam contemnit, tuae dominus erit. He that contemneth
his own life will be Master of thine. And from this Source proceeded the late
Gun-powder Plot.
But I believe not only fear but shame would divert Papists from writing
at this rate at this time of day: and I look on it as either a Sham or infatua|tion
in a Protestant writer, who in a Pamphlet whose haughty Title was
the Humble Remonstrance and Petition of English Protestants against English
and Irish Papists, to the Right Honourable the Lords and Commons Assembled
in Parliament, and which was published not long after the discovery of the
Popish Plot, when in p. 2. the Author saith of the Papists and the Plot,
Nor will the more impudent of them deny the thing in general, but much the
contrary insulting to us with Tertullian's implevimus omnia against the old Pa|gans.
We fill your Courts, your Armies, your Navies: it must take, you can|not
avoid it, 'tis a just cause to extirpate Heresy root and branch.
I believe there were no Papists so void of shame and sense as to speak
then what this Author mentions.
The Bishop of Winchester in his Letter to the Dutchess, Ianuary the 24th,
1670. and since printed, speaking of those, who were averse from Popery or
afraid of it, saith that, their number did take in 99 parts of 100 in the whole
Nation. His Lordship was a very modest Calculator in making the num|ber

of those who then de facto feared Popery to be no larger: and conse|quently
according to the Rule of quem metuunt derunt, referred to by the
Author of the Prelate and the Prince, the great number of those here
who hated Popery was very visible, and made the implevimus omnia to be
a very empty and ridiculous suggestion. But were the number of Papists
much greater then any timid Protestants seem to make it, the great real
encrease of Mankind, and mens being thereby preserved, must render the
turpitude of the former Principles of Cruelty to be very shameful.
In the Style of the Heathen Morality 'twas usual to call any thing turpe
that was not honestum, or honourable, or contrary to the generous na|ture
of man, and therefore to brand with the name of turpitude many
lawful Actions, for Non omne quod licet honestum: and thus what is un|worthy
of a Man or a Christian to do is often so called in the New Testa|ment,
and 'tis an error in any mens judgments or fancies to appropriate so
much the meaning of that word to fleshly Lusts. The Devil is called an
unclean Spirit in the New Testament though not supposeable to use bodily
Lusts or to confine his temptations to them. The filthiness of sin is men|tioned
by St. Paul to Timothy, and St. Iames 1. 21. commands the laying a|side
all filthiness, c.
A Sentence obtain'd from a Judge that was given by Bribery is said to be
lata per sordes, and for the turpitude of such a judgment a Judge was long since
brought to a shameful end in this Realm, and in his Enditement for Bribery
'twas said that he did violare sacramentum Domini Regis, and the reason
thereof was, that the Oath of our Kings relating to the doing of Justice
to their People, such corrupt Judges did by their injustice do violence to
that Oath of our Monarchs and in like manner all Kings generally being
by their Coronation Oaths bound to protect and defend their People, I
ask what King on earth can do it, if either an outragious Pope or the General
of the Jesuites shall secretly cause men to be killed by their Emissaries, and
what Subject can any were enjoy the benefit of the Tacit Paction between
him and the Law to the effect of fac hoc  vives, if he must hold his life
by the Tenure of a Jesuites Caprice?
This Orders sicarious Principles must therefore be naturally as fatal to
it as those of their Calumny beforementioned, and indeed this their affect|ed
Arbitrary Power over Hereticks lives is liable to the Battery of fear and
shame from the other Papists; for if such believing the Justice of the
Pope's Decree, shall speak ill of the Iesuites Contumacy, and on that ac|count
render that Society disobedient to Holy Church and scandalous to
the same, will not Tenet the 30th condemned by the Pope, viz. It is law|ful
for a Person of Honour to kill a man that intends to calumniate him if
there is no other way to avoid that Reproach, render the lives of such Pa|pists
forfeitable to the Jesuites Assassins: and again will it not render the
Jesuites lives forfeitable by their own Principles to such Papists, and thus
our Popish Layety and the Iesuites be in a State of War, instead of such
Layety being amicable Disciples and bountiful Patrons to them?
Neither the Law of God or the Land do trust the punishment of Male|factors
to private persons: but as Tolosanus de Repub. tells us, l. 13. c. 132.
Processum fuit judicialiter  sententi excommunicationis contra vermes radices
segetum edentes in diocesi Curiensi  constantiensi, (and he there sets down
such a Sentence of Excommunication pronounced against those animalcula)
so much more ought such Locusts tho now as to the Pope they have no King,
(I allude to Solomon's words, The Locusts have no Kings, yet go they forth in
Bands) and tho their Principles would eradicate the Lives of our Heredita|ry
Kings and their Subjects to have the legal benefit of Judicial Proceedings;

but the turpitude of such Principles and Practices as pollutes the Land
with Blood, and may bring a Curse upon it, is likely to bring them many
an extrajudicial Curse from the Popish and Protestant Populace; and if as
Tully tells us in his Offices, that there was a Law at Athens, that ordered
publick Execrations against all that did, viam erranti non monstrare, such Con|fessors
as by insinuations put people out of the right way by vile irreligio|nary
casuistical Principles so fatal to Souls and Bodies, must naturally be ana|thematized
by them.
Thus likewise by shame and fear in our populous English World must all
Bloody and Rebellious Principles own'd by any Persons that assume the
the name of Protestants be naturally hated: and if any are not ashamed or
afraid togive just occasion of Jealousie concerning such Hostile Principles, be|ing
secretly harboured in their minds, others will be ashamed and afraid to
keep them Company, and as if there were some speedy Judgment impen|ding
on those who conversed with them, according to that Proverb of
the Jews, Migrandum est ex eo loco in quo Rex non timetur.
The last prefatory Paragraph before the Bishops Survey is, that the
Heads and Preachers of the several Factions are such as had a great share in the
late Rebellion.
Such men tho like the Trumpeter in Alciat, they made part of the
fighters, and had been fairly dealt with by the Amnesty if they had not
been permitted any more in their profession to have lifted up their voices
like Trumpets again, or trusted to make any harangues to the People in
publick, yet at the time of that Survey were very few, and are now gene|rally
as silent in the Region of the Dead as Meroz was when they curs'd
him; and themselves are according to my Calculating Observation turn'd
to Earth, whose Voices like Air in the wrong place made such Earthquakes
in Church and State: and both fear and shame might teach them how in
bello non bis peccare, if their being Experts of the inconveniences of War
had not naturally excited in many an aversion to it; but with the sur|viving
Experts there doth undoubtedly a reminiscentia (which Mr. Hobbs
calls a re-conning) survive, how that the long Parliament had not former|ly
more fears and jealousies of Popery then of Presbytery, and of some of
the Divines of that perswasion designing to trouble every Parish with a
New Court-Christian, after the tremendous example in History of the In|quisition
for Heretical Pravity being first committed to the Orders of the
Dominican and Franciscan Fryars, and without any Tribunal, and which by
their zeal in preaching they afterward obtain'd with a vengeance, and to
the Scandal of Humane Nature; and how that that Parliament as Fuller
observes in his Church-History, would not trust the Presbyters to carry the Keys
of Excommunication at their Girdle, so that the Power thereof was not intrust|ed
to them, but ultimately resolved into a Committee of eminent Persons of Par|liament,
in which Thomas Earl of Arundel was first named; and moreover
how that England was then turned into such a common shore of Here|tical
Opinions that one of the most Learned of the Presbyterian Divines,
Mr. Iames Cranford in a Sermon of his called Haereseo-machria preached be|fore
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen at S. Pauls on February the 1st, 1645.
and printed in the following Year, saith there in p. 47. In eighty years there
did not arise among us so many horrid opinions and blasphemous Heresies under
Episcopacy (a Government decryed as Antichristian) as have risen in these few
years since we have been without a Government.
He had before in p. 5. said, it is lamentable what success errors have had
among our selves in these last 3 or 4 years of Ecclesiastical Anarchy and Con|sion,
whether we respect the numbers of Errors of the erroneous. Amsterdam,

Poland, Transylvania, Places most infamous for Heresies, are now righteous
if compared with England, London, which in so short a space have broach'd
or entertain'd above 160 Errors, many of them damnable.
And therefore I do not wonder that in a Pamphlet called, The exact
Collection of the Debates in the House of Commons in the last Parliament,
one Member is there brought in, observing in his Speech concerning the
Dissenters, that 'tis not probable that ever they will have a King of their
opinion, nor yet a Parliament by the best discoveries they had made of their
strength at the last Election. For according to the best Calculations that I
can make, they could not bring in above 1. in 20.
The present Gentlemanly Temper appearing in the People of England,
as to the not having Aversion or Resentments of Anger against any Mens
persons or their Converse by reason of their asserting controvertible points
that are capable of the name of Religion, must naturally make any asha|med
to vex their patience and disturb their security by asserting Principles
that really are Irreligion.
If any one did rake in the dust of Libraries for Names of absolete
Heresies to render the Papists or any else the fouler thereby, he would in
effect but needlessly foul his own fingers; as for example, if any one
should say the Papists have borrowed their Practice of extreme Unction
from the Valentinians and Heracleonites, their Notion of the Orders and
Quires of Angels from the Archonticks, the use and worshipping of Images
from the Carpocratians, the praying to the Virgin-Mary from the Colliri|dians,
the Veneration of the Cross from the Armenians, the Baptism
by Women from Marcion, the Baptizing in an unknown Tongue
from the Marcosians, and the voluntary Poverty and single Life of Priests
from the Apostolici, the using of small Bells in Celebrating the My|steries
of Religion from the Meletians. Nor would any be much concern'd
whether any old or new unheard of Hereticks communicated the Disease
of these Notions to the weak minds of the erring, since it doth not in|fect
Humane Society.
And there are several Traditions mentioned in some of the Ancient Fathers
as Apostolical, which tho the Papists do not observe, yet the World would not
make any angry Exclamations against them if it heard they did, as namely,
the mixture of Milk and Honey given to them that are newly Baptized,
the abstaining from washing a whole Week after, Oblations for the Birth|day
yearly, not to fast or kneel in Prayer or worshipping of God on the
the Lords Day, nor between Easter and Whitsuntide, all which are men|tioned
in Tertullian. Nor would any be now angry with another that
held either part of the Question, viz. If the Hallelujah may be sung in
Lent?
The great Controversy about Easter that heretofore put all the World
in a Rattle, and almost shook it to pieces, what a Toy is it self now repu|ted,
insomuch that our latest Ascertainers here of the time of its Celebra|tion
seemed not to think it tanti to be awake when they were about it;
and tho our lately having in our Almanacks two Easters in one year easily
awakened the Non-Conformists, to take notice of it and to say, that
therefore they could not give their unfeigned assent and consent to all and
every thing contained and prescribed in and by the Book intituled the Book
of Common Prayer, c. And tho thereupon a person of the Royal Society ve|ry
profoundly knowing in all the Mathematical Sciences, and likewise in the
knowledge of Theology and of the Canon Law, and the Ecclesiastical
Law of England, hath published an infallible way of fixing Easter for ever
(and that it may be no longer a Fugitive from the Rule of its Practice as it

often is at present (nor dance away from it self, as I may say, in allusion to
the vulgar error of the Suns dancing on Easter day) and fixing it so as per|haps
none else could have done, nor possibly himself any other way; yet
hath this great right done to that great day been by the generality of peo|ple,
not so much regarded as would an Advice to a Painter, or such
like Composure have been.
Any one that would design to make another fermentation in the World
by the terms of Homo-ousios and Homoi-ousios would no more effect it, than
by the Criticks Controversy in Boccaline, whether Consumptum should be
spelled with a p or no: to which purpose I heard one cite it out of Luther,
that he said anima mea odit terminum istum Homo-ousion, tho yet he knew
Homo-ousios was the right opinion and Homoi-ousios the wrong.
And that one word Heresy that hath produced such furious Tempests in
the World that have torn up States and Kingdoms by the Roots, how is it
now generally among men of ingenuity and wit here reduced to its quiet
and primitive signification, viz. the taking of an opinion, or a private
opinion without reference to truth or falshood, and to import nothing
more of affront then when used by Tully, as Non sum in eadem tecum haeresi;
I am not of your opinion: and the common Vogue of Heretics amounts to
opinitre, and Heresy to opinitrete: and as a Whirl-wind may be supposed
to have blown some one thing into its place, as each other thing out of it,
so have the Whirl-winds Heresy hath disturbed the World by, happened at
last to blow its signification into its right and original State.
Our Courts Christian which in order to the Salus animae might still pro|secute
Men for Heresy, as well as Vsury, have given no Heretics or Vsurers,
any Cause of Complaint for molestation; tho yet in the Articles of Visita|tion
this is one, is there any person a known or reputed Heretick or Schisma|tick.
But as in the Diocesess in the Country and even in the Cities there,
the Church-wardens having not troubled themselves to know what Ani|mal
a Heretick is, so neither is our Layety in our Metropolis in the humour
to mind the Genus and Differentia in the definition of a Heretick. Nor
will they be ever likely to make any such Presentment as Mr. Nath. Bacon
said in one of his printed Discourses; he hath seen, made formerly by some of
St. Mary Overies, Item we saine that John Stephens is a man we cannot well
tell what to make of him, and that he hath Books we know not what they
are.
Our English Genius is so improved by the excellent temper and discourses
of that breed of rational Divines our Church of England hath been blest
with since the King's Restoration, that it generally abhors the thoughts of
punishing a Heretick as such with death, as a severity that hath in it the tur|pitude
of injustice and cruelty. And since the very Fathers and School|men
could never agree about the point who are formally Hereticks and
that the acutest among them make the formality of Heresy to consist in
Pertinacy or Contumacy, which are inward Acts of the Mind and which
none but the Scrutator renum can know, it may well seem shameful for
any to agree in punishing it with death.
What a shameful narrowness of mind was there in the Divines that go|verned
our Church in the times of the late Vsurpation, when those Triers
of Ministers would allow none to have a Living or Cure of Souls that
asserted the Tenets of Arminius in Religion, which yet carry a face of so
much probability to be maintained, that a man who having used his ut|most
care in the investigation of truth therein asserts them, may claim it
as his due by the purchase of Christs Blood, that when he is required to
deliver his opinion about the same, his asserting it that way should not ex|pose

him to punishment. And there is no Controverted Religionary Spe|culative
Point of that Nature wherein there is among Learned Men pro|babilis
causa litigandi (and in some Cases too where it may touch too
close upon our Articles and Homilies) in which liberty of differing in
Judgment is here either prejudicial to their Interest or common Esteem.
Thus tho all the Reformed Churches make the Pope to be Antichrist, and
particularly our Church of England in its Homilies hath done so, our Fa|mous
Dr. Hammond adventured as he thought himself obliged in Consci|ence
to publish it, that Simon Magus was the man.
The most judicious Comparers of times are sensible that there is now a
more valuable libera theologia in England then was during the Usurpation.
How glad would many of the Independent, and Presbyterian Divines
then have been of the liberty to have taught their Flocks the Notions they
then thought of importance as to the Divine Decrees, tho they had been
allowed to have so done only in Surplices, or in Vests of Indian feathers,
or any habits imaginable? The old way of arguing about speculative points
in Religion with passion and loudness and being tedious therein, is grown
out of use, and a Gentlemanly Candour in discourse of the same with that
moderate temper that men use in debating natural Experiments has succeed|ed
in its room, and 'tis accounted Pedantry for any one in good Company
to pass for a Victor in Notions by having the last word, and seeming a
Baffler in dispute. And the truth is, our Divines and the Lay Literati ha|ving
since the King's Restoration been more addicted to the Study of real
Learning then formerly, which requires quiet of thought in its pursuit,
hath brought noise out of Request.
I need not again mention the Obligation our Land hath received from
the Royal Society, in making so great a Plantation of real knowledge in it.
'Twas high time at last when the Kingdom was settled on its proper Basis
to improve it with such strong and nervous knowledge, that would be
like the strong man keeping Possession in mens understandings, during which
either Poperies or Presbyteries Kingdom of Darkness cannot overthrow
our Quiet.
There were in the Year 1599. reckoned in Christendom 2,25044 Mona|steries,
and from whence all the great Revenue there bestowed on men to
think, sent not perhaps one Notion of real Learning into the World. But
their professed business was to extinguish the light of Knowledge, and not
to increase it, and that which they made their real Study was to find out
Artifices to make Mankind fit still and quiet in the dark, and to invent
torments and punishments for those that would not do so: and to ridicule
those who pryed into nature and but looked toward Arithmetick and Geo|metry,
by the Name of Students of the black Art and Conjurers, a humour
that was not quite exterminated hence from the time of Fryer Bacon to
my Lord Bacon: for our pious Martyrologer mentioning occasionaly Dr.
Dee the Mathematician, called him Dr. Dee the Conjurer.
Thus Almighty God tho the first thing he made for the World in general
was external light, yet one of the last things he hath made or so much blessed
the World with, is real Learnings intellectual Light, and even that where|by
we so knowingly converse with his works of Nature: and so careless
was Mankind in considering the frame of their own bodies, that Dr. Hen|shaw
a late Ornament of the Royal Society hath truely observed it in his
Book of Fermentation, That within the Compass of this last Century the know|ledge
of Anatomy hath been enriched by a full third part at least. Mankind
was so busie in murthering one anothers bodies of old under the Notion of
Christians, and afterward as Hereticks, that it had no leisure to dissect

them, and was wholly taken up by studying experiments of Cruelty equal
to the making of live Anatomies of each other. And tho the Holy
Iesus came into the World not to destroy mens lives but to save them, and
for that purpose tho the Divine Philanthropy chose that time for his co|ming
into the World when the  was arrived at a greater
heighth then ever before, yet by the depraved nature of man perverting
and corrupting the use of Religion, the fantastick vile sacrificing of men
hath since encreased.
In the Infanticidium of Herod's that was presently after the Birth of the
Holy Child Iesus, Samuel Siderocrates saith, that there were slain of Infants
of 2 years old and under that Age, 444000: and Paulus Volzius makes
them to be a Million and 44 Thousand.
And afterward among the Heathens, he was accounted the Magnus
Apollo, not who could find ways of saving, but destroying Christian
men. No fewer than seven Books were writ by Vlpian to shew
the several punishments that ought to be inflicted on Christians. And tho
Livy saith of the Romans, in hoc gloriari licet nulli gentium mitiores placu|isse
paenas, yet Tacitus tells us of the Christians in the 15th Book of his
Annals, Primo correpti qui fatebantur, deinde indicio eorum multitudo in|gens
haud perinde in crimine incendii, quam odio humani generis convicti sunt.
Ea pereuntibus addita ludibria, aut ferarum tergis contecti, laniatu canum in|terirent,
aut crucibus affixi aut flammandi, aut ubi defecisset dies in usum no|cturni
luminis urerentur.
Several Authors relate it as a Decree of Nero's, Quisquis Christianum se
esse confitetur, is tanquam generis humani convictus hostis, sine ulteriori sui
defensione, capite plectitor.
Enough hath been already said to parallel the Cruelty of new Rome,
with that of old toward the Heterodox: and how ingenious the Virtuosi
of the Inquisition have been in finding out such torments for Heretics, as can
multiply one death into a thousand, I with horrour think of. How pro|found
a submission and deference to the unaccountable Will of Heaven doth
this Consideration require, namely, that Christs little Flock even in the
Ark of his Church, is not only endangered by a deluge from without,
but by one within, and that of its own blood, and that the Sheep of Christ
appear to a common eye to be (as it were) made on purpose to feed the
grievous Wolves that are entred in among them, and as it may be supposed that
thousands of harmless Sheep were in the Ark of Noah employed to feed,
perhaps about 20 pair of the hurtful Carnivorous Beasts: nay which is
more, that Heaven should permit such great slaughters of its little Flock
to feed the very vitiated fancies of the worst of men, as was before insi|nuated!
But who can without shame for depraved Mankind, and a heart inward|ly
bleeding, think of the result of the Popes Gift of America to the King
of Spain, where so many Millions of the poor Natives having had no pro|mulgation
of the Law of Christianity, and were accountable to God only
for the violation of the Law of Nature, were so unnaturally murthered by
the Spaniards, that it would seem incredible that God having made of one
blood all Nations (as 'tis said in the Scripture) and there being a natural
Cognation between all Humane kind as the expression is in the Digests, they
should depopulate that part of the World of a greater number of Souls
than is now living in the flourishing Kingdom of France, if that Famous
Spanish Bishop Bartholomaeus de las Casas hath made a true Estimate of the
Spanish Cruelty in the West-Indies, namely, that in about 45 years the Spa|niards
by several monstrous Cruelties put to death 20 Millions of Indians.

At this rate of murderous Mankinds thus outraging one another, the
World would seem to be likely to end before it was (as I may say) to
purpose begun, I mean the purpose of God Almighty.
But the thought of the shame of being outwitted by our Neighbour
Nations, and the fear of being outdone by them in strength, populousness
and riches, and our certain knowledge, (as was partly before hinted)
that toward the latter end of the World by the growing populousness of
Mankind, we must naturally and without any eye on prediction in Scrip|ture
more and more hear of Wars and rumours of Wars, and the shame of
our encouraging a few Traders in Contraband Religions to hope they can
ever destroy the Peace and Trade of the Kingdom again, must (supposing
Heretics to be men) naturally make the former Mode of killing them ap|pear
not more barbarous then ridiculous.
Sir W. P. having in his excellent Manuscript, called Verbum sapienti
made excellent Computations of the wealth of the Kingdom, and of the
value of the People, and of the several expences of the Kingdom and of its
Revenues, and in his last Chapter there considered how to employ the People and
with what great industry, doth like a Noble Philosopher conclude it with these
two Queries and their Answers, viz. But when should we rest from this great
industry? I answer when we have certainly more Money than any of our Neigh|bour
States, (tho never so little) both in Arithmetical and Geometrical Pro|portion
(i. e. when we have more years Provision aforehand, and more present
Effects.) What then should we busie our selves about? I answer in ratiocinations
upon the Works and Will of God, to be supported not only by the indolency, but
also by the pleasure of the body, and not only by the tranquility but serenity
of the mind, and this exercise is the natural end of man in this World, and
that which best disposeth him for his Spiritual Happiness in that other which is
to come. The motions of the mind being the quickest of all others afford most
variety wherein is the very form and being of pleasure, and by how much the
more we have of this pleasure, by so much the more we are capable of it, ad in|finitum.
And thanks be to Heaven we have no Isthmus in Nature to dig through,
which yet by our many hands might be done. 'Tis but the removal of
the broken Fence and bowing Wall of a Religion-Trade, which we can well
look over and easily see through as now broken and bowing, and which is
the more loath'd for having so long and so much debarred us from real
Trade and real Knowledge, and too from real Religion, and this flowry
Coast will be as free to the feet of us Northern Heretics so called, as 'tis
now to our Eyes, and we through the effects of our populousness, and be|ing
necessitated to industry, be secured from any fear of sharing in a Pro|phetick
Calculation that might be called, The Burthen of the North, made
by a late Author of a Discourse of Trade, That the French without the
use of their Iron, will command all the Silver of the North and sweep it a|way
thence by the over-balance of Trade. But after all the Souths raillery
on the North, they will find that the Northern half of the World hath
more Earth, more Men, more Ships and Sea-men, more Stars, more day,
and more light of the Gospel, and I may add, more good nature and
frankness, more bodily strength and fewer Plagues, and Earth-quakes
then the Southern. And where most people are 'tis no Heresy nor Enthu|siastic
Prophecy, to say that there will in time be most Trade: which ap|peared
by England's not being afraid to throw the Die of War against both
France and Spain, in the beginning of the Reign of the Royal
Martyr.

As the over-balance of Trade is insensibly lost in any Country, it is
likewise so regained, and in time will appear regain'd, and like health in
the body of a man of a strong Vitals after his being seized by and recovered
from a Chronical Disease, and of the time of the beginning and ending of
which by unforeseen Accidents, no shadow of a Dial or sound of a Clock
could give the indication.
I shall assign an instance of this in our own Kingdom. The Author of
Britannia languens calculates 2,50000 l. per Annum to have been formerly
at a Medium for 76 years brought into England by the balance of its whole
Trade in the World.
Committees of Parliament have worthily laboured in several Sessions to
model and draw Bills for the making us wear our own Woollen Manufa|ctures,
and many who have writ Books and Proposals about Trade, have
very honestly endeavoured to perswade us so to do. But as the saying is,
accidit in puncto, c. an Accident too low for our States-mens considerati|on,
hath for several years caused England to gain more then it did by the
aforesaid Balance of Trade, viz. the said 2,50000 l. at a Medium for 76
years; and this Accident is the general fashion of Womens wearing Crape.
And because I have conversed with none who has observed the effect of
this Accident, and which tho seeming small, is very momentous, and ap|pears
(as many things in Trade do) like great Weights hanging some|times
on small Wires, I shall divert your Lordship by Calculating en pas|sant
what England gains thereby, in such a way as the Nature of the thing
will bear, and may passable serve to have it done in.
A pound of Wooll makes 15 yards of Crape. Each Female one with
another may be supposed to wear about 10 yards of Crape in her Appa|rel.
There are in London probably about 100,000 Females that wear
Crape. It may be supposed that in all England and Wales there being ten
times as many Females as in London, that one half of this proportion of
the London Crape-wearers may wear Crape in the Country, viz. half a
Million in all. It may be supposed therefore that the Crape-wearers one
with another wearing ten yards a piece, that five Millions of Yards of
Crape may be yearly worn in England and Wales, and that one pound of
Wooll making fifteen yards of Crape will occasion the Consumption of a
third part of a Million of Pounds weight of Wooll per Annum, viz. 333000
and 333 pounds weight of Wooll which (accounting fine Wooll such as
makes Crape to be worth one Shilling per Pound) amounts to 16000 l.
Sterling. The labour of the People in Manufacturing the same, amounts
to about thirty times as much as the Wooll, viz. half a Million of Pounds
Sterling: and this yearly gain England cannot miss of while the Women
of the Court continue the fashion of wearing Crape, whom the Women
of the City and Country will imitate in their garb.
If any shall think that the allowance of 10 yards to be yearly worn
by each Female Crape-wearer may seem too much, he may consider that
some Crape used by men about their Apparel, and the great quantity
thereof employed in shrouding the Dead, pursuant to the late Act (and
which but for the invention and use of the Manufacture of Crape, perhaps
would not have been effectually put in Execution) may probably incline
him to be of an opinion that England gains more vastly by this new Ma|nufacture
of Crape, then I have supposed.
The ridiculing humour of so many in the Age, may perhaps move them
to think observations of this kind to be unimportant. But if any shall
take a Prospect of the substantial and great wisdom of our Ancestors in our
Statute-Book, he may find there 11 Acts of Parliament about Thrums and

Yarn, and many about Fustians, and 26 about Worsted, and Worsted-Wea|vers,
and another Statute of Pouledavis: but there is that of moment in
my Account relating to England's Gain from Crape, that after 145 Sta|tutes
made to advance our Wooll and Drapery and Dyers and our Woollen
Manufactures, so much decayed in spight of them all, this seeming poor
little thing hath without any Act of Parliament enriched us.
And many are the Foundations of Manufactures laid in our Country
Cities, and daily growing since the time that Dr. Williams Arch-Bishop of
York in his Speech in the Parliament of 1640. in defence of the Bishops Votes
observed, that Tapsters, Brewers, Inn-keepers, Taylors and Shoo-makers do
integrate and make up the body of our Country Cities and Incorporations.
And tho the Northern Heretics are crasso sub aere nati, yet have they (as
was said) compensative Advantages from nature, and as if nature meant
them more then others for Lords of the Sea and Navigation, the
Pole of the Magnet which seateth it self North, hath been observed
to be always the most vigorous and strong Pole to all intents and purposes,
and the Magnetical Virtue impressed on the Earth is there more
strong likewise, I mean on the Church Land seized on from the Papal Idlers
and Burthens of that Earth to support the necessary defence of the State,
and therefore will necessarily attract mens Iron and their understandings
with Justice to keep it. Dr. Heylin in his Geography in Folio tells
us, that 'tis not so much the Authority of Calvin, or the Malignant Zeal
of Beza, or the impetuous Clamors of their Disciples which made the Episco|pal
Order to grow out of Credit, as the Avarice of some great Persons in
Court and State, who greedily gaped after the poor Remnant of their Possessi|ons.
But tho nothing like an over-Balance of the Clergy in the wealth of
the Kingdom ought to have sunk that Order and its Revenue in England,
(where perhaps ten times as much is spent either on the Law or on Physick
as is on the Clergy) it need not be wondered at, that in those Countries of
the North where they are continually standing to their Arms at least of
defence, and Calculating their Provision for War, that the Lutheran
Princes (as Heylin saith) have divided the Episcopal Function from its
Revenue assuming to themselves much of the latter, and sometime giving
part thereof to their Nobility, with the Title of Administrators of such a
Bishoprick, and of super-intendent to those who have there the Pastoral Soli|citude,
and with some proportion of the Revenue for their maintenance not
much exceeding what is usually received by Calvinist Ministers.
And if my Lord Primate Bramhal may pass for a good Casuistical Judge
of the Law of God, who in p. 39. of his just Vindication of the
Church of England, speaking of an excessive Revenue of the Clergy and
their over-balancing the Layety, saith, And if the excess be so exorbi|tant
that it is absolutely and evidently destructive to the Constitution of the
Common-wealth (it is lawful upon some Conditions and Cautions not necessary to
be here inserted) to prune the superfluous Branches, and to reduce them to a
right temper and aequilibrium for the preservation and well being of the
whole Body Politick, and if any Credit ought to be given to the Account of
Cardinal Pool shewed to me within these few hours, relating to the over-Balance
of the old Ecclesiastick Revenue here, after he had used all his
own diligence and that of others to prepare a Calculation of the same for
the Pope, and had sent 3 Reams of Paper of this to the Pope that are now
in his Archives, and had acquainted the Pope therein, That it was visible
that had not the Church here fallen into the Shipwrack of its Revenues, the
Ecclesiasticks had here in a short time insensibly rendred themselves Lords of

the whole Kingdom, and that there were more Colleges and Hospitals in England
than in France, which exceeds England by two thirds both in Lands and Num|bers
of People, we may very well conclude that had any accidental force
in Queen Mary's time renversed the alienation of the Church Lands, that
force would not have long continued, and should any as wild Imaginers
may suppose, happen for the future here, or perhaps in other Kingdoms of
the North, those Lands would soon appear to all to have such a Magnetical
Vertue as is in the Globe of the Earth, whereby as to its natural points
it disposeth it self to the Poles, being so framed and ordered to those points
that those parts which are now at the Poles would not naturally abide un|der
the Aequator, nor Green-land remain in the place of Magellanica; and
thus it may be said that if the whole Earth were violently removed,
it would not forsake its Primitive Points nor pitch in the East or West,
but very soon return to its Polary position again, and resemblingly in any
new forced over-balance of those Church Lands, the very dull Earth's
Animus revertendi, to the just libration of States and Kingdoms would
soon be apparent; and neither the Popes moving the Earth, or even Ar|chimedes
his doing it would have been of any importance: and the Papal
Pride elevating him to say with Lucifer sedebo in monte testamenti in lateri|bus
Aquilonis, I will sit in the sides of the North would soon be attended
with the Exclamation of How art thou fallen, O Lucifer, Son of the Morning,
c. and, Is this the man that made the Earth to tremble? France that I be|lieve
exceeded England by two thirds in the number of People in Queen
Mary's time when Cardinal Pool made his Estimate thereof, did securely
heretofore suffer great numbers of its People to be unemployed in it, as
namely, the Beggars and others of the lower ranks, and through want of
opportune means of subsisting at home to seek their Fortunes abroad, and
that not as 'tis in the Case of so many Scots yearly leaving their Country,
(the which perhaps is not able well to nourish more Inhabitants than it
hath) but through the abovementioned want of encouragement to con|tinue
in that opulent and fertile Kingdom, a Kingdom that Grotius doth
but right to, when in the Dedicatory Epistle of his De jure belli  pacis to
Lewis the just, having mentioned the Kingdom of Heaven, he saith, which
Kingdom only is better then yours.
And 'tis no wonder if the Ministers and Counsellors of State there did not
concern themselves to make rational Estimates of the growing Populous|ness
of the Northern Countries, and particularly of England, when no|thing
of that kind was perhaps so much as attempted here before the proba|ble
inferences of the Observator on the Bills of Mortality made about the
same.
As to the former unconcernedness of France in preserving or encreasing
the numbers of its People, there is an observation of Sir Thomas Culpeper
Knight, in his Discourse about Vsury where he saith, France tho so good a
soyle lies half of it waste, the Natives even loathing their own Country, and
burdening all the habitable World with their beggarly Colonies, one third of
the Lacqueys and Valets in Europe being French Men. Witness Dr. Heylin
who tells us, that once at Madrid they banished them all as dangerous for their
numbers, finding the French Servants in that Town alone to exceed Thirty
Thousand, so just and natural is it for oppression to disarm it self.
But I have already mentioned it that the present Great French Monarch,
not more renowned for his Armaforis then his Consilium domi, and his able
Counsellors there, doth by Accurate Measures study the encrease of his
People, and 'tis very remarkable that in the Code Loys which he publish|ed
in April, 1667. he made some Ordinances with great care for the Re|gistring

the Christenings and Marriages and Burials in each Parish in his
Realm, as appears by Title 20. Article 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. there from p.
107, to 112. and with much more exactness then the Bills of Mortality in
our Metropolis are ordered, and the which that Great Prince thought wor|thy
to be enjoyned in his Code of Laws, having perhaps been informed by
his Ministers that many Political Inferences as to the knowing the numbers
of People and their encrease in any State are to be made from the Bills of
Mortality, on the occasion of some such published about 3 years before
by the Observator on the Bills of Mortality in England, and where tho
many are apt to think that the Registring of the Births of People was first
used and invented by Cromwel, in Harry the 8ths time; yet is the thing as old
as the ancient times of the Romans, and among them introduced by Servius
Tullius, who to ascertain the number of Births and Burials, ordered that when
a Child was born, the Kindred of the Child should bring a piece of Money
into the Aerarium of Iuno Lucina, and so likewise in the Exchequer of Ve|nus
libitina when any died or came to Age. And this Custom being quite
abolished, was revived by Augustus Caesar at the Birth of Children as Lips.
on Tacit. observes.
But what was worthy of the French King's providing for the stability
of his Throne, he further ordered an exact Registry to be took of the num|bers
of his half Subjects, I mean the Regulars and Seculars by the following
Articles there, namely, the 15th, 16th, 17th, in that Title.
Mr. Samuel Pepys that Great Treasurer of Naval and Maritime Know|ledge,
and of that great Variety of the Learning which we call recondita
eruditio, having Communicated to me the sight of a Paper mentioning
that in the whole Number of Men in the Realm of Spain, long since when
by secret Survey, there were returned a 11 Hundred and 25 Thousand and
3 Hundred and 90 Men, (and which secret Survey I suppose was made some
time before the Year 1588.) I observed that the number of the Regular
and Secular Clergy was not included in that Survey.
But I think the numbring of the many Regulars there who (no doubt) so
often say in their hearts, Nos numerus sumus, c. had been of as much impor|tance
to the Government, as the numbering of the Lay-men, and for the num|ber
of which the Code Lois hath as aforesaid so carefully provided, and
thereby made the prudence of this French Kings Code outweigh Iustinian's,
and hath discovered to the World the acuteness of his understanding, to be
not inferior to that of his Sword. And the Expences of the Crown being
under the Government of this Monarch so very much greater than in his Fa|thers
time, have necessarily occasioned such an exact knowledge of the
Numbers and Wealth of his Realm, as hath provided him his strong Si|news
for War.
Thuanus on the Year 1615. tells us how that Lewis the 13th, Having ap|pointed
some Persons to compute his Expences and Receipts for the Year 1614.
That one and twenty Millions and fifty thousand Livres. i. e. (at 20d. a Livre)
one Million, 7 Hundred, 54 Thousand, 66 Pounds Sterling, were issued out
of the Exchequer, and that 17 Millions and 8 Hundred Thousand Livres,
i. e. 1 Million, 4 Hundred, 83 Thousand, 3 Hundred 30 Pounds Sterling were
brought into it, and so his Expences then exceeded his Receipts three Millions
seven Hundred Thousand Livres: i. e. 2 Hundred 70 Thousand 8 Hundred
33 l. Sterling: and beside those Receipts and Expences the Historian saith,
that there were eighteen Millions of Livres Collected out of the Provinces i. e.
1 Million 5 Hundred 8 Thousand 3 Hundred Thirty Three Pounds Sterling,
and which were distributed in them for the Pay of the Officers there employed
for other Expences there. So that the Expences and Receipts of that Crown

since the Year 1614. were more then quadrupled in the Year 1673, of the
which I mentioned the Total before and abstracted the same from a Paper
that some Merchants gave in to the Loyal long Parliament, wherein the par|ticular
Sums accruing from the respective Generalities in France are set
down, as likewise others are in Klockius de aerario for another Year.
We have already found that it is not so many of our Peoples taking the
name of this great and wise Monarch in vain, that will do our Business,
or their wishing the Ocean of the Wealth of that Kingdom exhausted
that will do it; and 'tis now visible to all that nothing can prevent its en|crease
but the stopping up the Rivers of Money that run into that Sea, from
our Countries and others for the Commodities and Manufactures of that
Kingdom, that can only produce that effect, and which not so much our
hatred of France, as love of our selves will necessitate us to produce, and
which therefore must stop up the Rivers of Contributions, that from de|luded
or Enthusiastic People formerly ran into the Religion-Trade, and
then the great Cry of Templum Domini get as little Wooll from the King|dom
as it hath brought to it, and the zeal of the very Vox populi drive such
Buyers and Sellers and Money changers out of it that formerly made it a Den
of Thieves: and indeed if it should be supposed that the Balance of solid
Trade should continue for the future to be against us, to the proportion it
has been estimated of late years, neither Papists nor Presbyterians would
be able to maintain a double Clergy as now they do, I mean their own,
and that by Law established.
'Tis fresh in Memory that the House of Commons, in the Kings long Par|liament,
ordered the Commissioners of the Customs to compute for them
what Goods went hence to France in a year, and their value, and what in
that time came from thence hither and their value, and that they computed
that the value of those exported hence into France was about 1 hundred
and 70 thousand Pounds, and the value of those imported here from France
was about 1 Million and a half, beside 6 or 7 hundred thousand Pounds worth
of Goods, they supposed were brought in by stealth as Silks, Embroyde|ries,
c. at which rate 'tis possible we may have about a 3d part of the
Current Money of England yearly carried into it: and indeed all our grave
Laws against sending Money in Specie out of the Country when the Ba|lance
of Trade is against us, are but hedging in the Cuckow: and so we have
by necessity of Nature the Prospect of a busie World before us, that we
may recover that Balance on our side. And during that Conjuncture of
Business all the Nerves of our Minds must be extended to prevent our doom,
from that forementioned Sentence of late so much in vogue, and which I
have heard some men living falsly vouch'd for the Authors of, viz. Res
nolunt mal administrari; for it is in Tully, who I suppose had it from Aristo|tle,
to whom Venerable Bede who died 949 years ago, refers in his Axio|mata
Philosophica printed at London in 12^o, as the Author of it in the Mar|gint
of that Axiome, entia nolunt mal disponi, quoting Aristotles Metaphy|sicks.
Among Bedes works 2d Tome p. 151. the Axiome is thus worded,
Nolunt entia mal gubernari. Men may ill Administer their understandings,
as by Credulity, Supineness and the like, and they may think by the Artifice
of Laws to pinion the wings of our riches from flying away, and as absurdly
as Sylla would by an Edict be judged fair: but things meant by the
word entia or being will not be ill administred: and 'tis easier to fix Quick-silver
then the being of our Silver here, if our importations preponderate.
The gravity of our Laws can no more make it stay still here than the
Vox populi, and the Almanacks can make a real Solstice, or the Sun at the
time of the year they call the Solstice not to move forward in the Zodiack,
as much as at any other times.

The Being of Money in a populous Country that hath no competent
Mines in it, depends on the Being of Trade, and the Being of the so many
Millions of Mouths in our Realm, will necessitate the Millions of hands
to work, and the growing dearness of Provisions, and cheapness of Wages
will enforce men to work harder, and the res parta labore will not be ill
administred, nor sacrificed to Idlers, nor false Gods as formerly
find true Perfumes here, nor Metaphysical Entities or Notions rob
men of useful Chymical Essences, or rob Kingdoms of their being de|fended,
and enriched, by destroying the Beings or Lives of so many Men as
Hereticks, and Beings that the Papacy endeavouring to administer ill,
and by its enslaving men making Persons res, caused so many defections
from it; nor that precious thing called time suffer it self to be ill admini|stred
by Presbyterians erecting ten thousand new Tribunals, or (as one
may call them) Ecclesiastical Courts of Pye-powder, that is one in each
of our Parishes, when as those men have been heard to complain of the
Grievances Trade hath found from one Court-Christian in a Diocess: and
the same necessity which did make our Manufacturing Peoples Appe|tite
for their Daily Bread to be the ingenii largitor, or whet their Wits for
the invention of Crape, may in all probability produce Manufactures of
Hemp and Flax as considerable as that of Wooll hath been and is,
which I think must naturally happen from the many French Protestants
and others here lately planted, and a more important Linen Manufacture
be here by them introduced, then was the woollen one set up by the Dutch
Protestants, whom the Duke of Alva's Persecution brought hither: and
which no Act of Parliament here or Projects of Work-houses would pro|bably
have effected, or necessity else have brought in among us in some
Ages. And hence will a great improvement of our Land and Employ|ment
of our People probably happen by the sowing of Hemp and Flax,
for which so much Money goes out yearly hence in specie, and then design
of sowing which hath hitherto proved Abortive in several Parliaments,
and particularly in one of the last Parliaments of Queen Elizabeth, and
likewise in the King's long Parliament. Considering how easie it will be
for those of the French Nation who are here, and who were used to make
Canvas and Sail-cloth for our Naval uses, (and for which France hath
long had so much Money from us) to make it here and by the Bait of
the Gain thereby accruing, to engage several of our Poor to work in that
Manufacture, our Nation is not likely to be long without it here advanced,
and many of our People therein busied: and 'twill easily appear necessary to
all to promote the making the same here, who shall recollect that the French
King in that last War with him did forbid the importing it hither. And
that coarser Manufacture once introduced will naturally make way for
the Manufacture of fine Linen, and those Manufactures found generally
gainful will naturally employ the Proprietors of Land in sowing great part
of the same with Hemp and Flax, and our good Land hereby retriving
its former value of years purchace, be no longer ill administred.
I believe therefore that if shortly the Curious abroad shall send to their
knowing Correspondents here for a Political Map, or Scheme of our Affairs,
and ask what is become of the fantastick Vtopias, Oceanas, and new Atlan|tis'es
that our late Visionaries and idle Santerers to a pretended new Ierusa|lem
roubled England with, and shall further send hither to their friends
that old Question, Quid rerum nunc geritur in Anglia, The Return they will
receive from England will be to the following effect, viz. That People in
that Noble and very Populous Country do there mind things, that the
Trade of words is spoiled, that the business of sowing Tares is over, and that

he will be the inimicus homo to himself who doth it; that the sowing the
Wind of Errors in the Church, and the reaping the Whirl-wind of Confusion in
the State is grown hateful: that they have done weaving of jus Divinum, and
dying of Religion with false Colours, and preparing Nets and Snares of death
for one another: and that the most ungovernable Animals troubling others
with Projects of Government of the Church is out of fashion; that they have
done there with Science falsly so called, and quae non habet amicum nisi igno|rantem,
and with Trade falsly so called, the false Religion-one that hath no
friend but the knave; that their eyes are there opened and they see, that res
accendunt lumina rebus, and their hands are at work in Trade and Lucre with|out
turpitude; that they can no more be brought like St. Francis his Novice to
set Plants with the head downward, nor at the instigation of factious Heads of
Religionary Parties, to do with their Notions as Fryar Iohn at his Abbots
Command, did with a dry withered stick which he planted, and twice a day
for a whole year fetched water two Miles off to water it, and omitting it no
Festival day; that they speak more of Christ and talk less of Anti-Christ,
and do promote Christianity by solid Industry and Charity; and the living there
are Aparrel'd with their own Linen as the Dead are with their own Wooll,
and are grown so dexterous in the Linen Trade that it may be said of them
what Klockius doth of the Dutch, 'tis to be doubted, plusne in lanificio an
vero in linificio illi praestent; and thus by means of a true and undefiled and
laborious Religion there, Antichristus lino periit, as I may say with Allusion
to a forementioned Phrophecy. The Genius and Interest that England hath in se|veral
Conjunctures been intent on devouring the Religion-Trade (and which still
hath slip'd from its seisure) hath now at last effectually swallowed it up:
and just as a Cormorant swallowing an Eel, and the Eel slipping out through its
Body, is soon by that potent Creature again swallowed, and again slipping
through its Body, is at last certainly macerated and dissolv'd in its Stomach,
and still the Cormorant hath weakened the Eel in its passage through it, thus
hath it in England fared with the Religion-Trade: that as Luther said of
one great point in Religion, it was doctrina stantis  cadentis Ecclesiae, the
Notion of the not getting or losing by Religion there, is accounted the Doctri|na
stantis  cadentis Reipublicae. That time hath laid so close and long a
Siege to the Popish and Presbyterian Religion-Trade, that as it was in the
Siege of Ostend, there is no more Earth left it to defend. That as Physici|ans
observe of superfetation in Women, if it be made with considerable inter|mission,
the latter most commonly proves Abortive, for that the first being con|firmed
engrosseth the Aliment from the other, it hath happened so in England
to the superfetation of Reformation. That the Trade of Reformation unduely
prosecuted by Art, hath been diverted by the Reformation of Trade resulting
from Nature, and the over spreading the Land with such a great and useful
Linen-Trade and Materials for the same, as hath in a manner exterminated
Poverty from the same.
And while now Nature seems to Court our Expectation with the proba|bility
of this new Scheme of Trade, and Manufacture, (and which
perhaps will stay with us till the Scheme or fashion of this World shall
finally pass away) I shall take occasion to discharge my self of a promise I
long ago made to your Lordship, when you were Treasurer of the Navy,
which was to send you an account of the rough Hemp and Flax, and Sail-Cloth,
and of all the other Manufactures of Hemp and Flax, imported
into England yearly: and now that it may appear what quantities of
Hemp and Flax, and the Manufactures thereof have been here imported,
and from what Countries, and that thereby we may usefully take our mea|sures
about the proportion, to which this new Trade and improvement of

our Land should at least be advanced, and because likewise the former
measures of computing what Sail-Cloth and fine Linen have been here
imported, were taken generally from blundering Estimates and random
Calculations, and that we may see it possible, tho France hath got the start
of us in the Linen Manufacture, that we may yet overtake it in the Race,
for that 'tis apparent tho much Sail-Cloth, yet little or no fine Linen
hath thence come to us, I shall here entertain your Lordship with
an Account of the Linen-Cloth, Canvas, Linen Yarn, Hemp, Flax and
Cordage imported into the Port of London, from Michaelmas 1668. to Mi|chaelmas
1669. which was drawn up for me by the favour of one of the
late Farmers of the Customs. I happened to make choice of that year
for the quantity of those importations, as being a year of Peace, but was
since told by the Merchants that that year being the second after the Fire
of London, there was then imported into London about a 3d part less of
those Commodities than was in common years; the which happened be|cause
the year before being the next after the Fire, an extraordinary glut
of those Goods was then brought in.
Your Lordship thereby seeing what then came into the Port of London,
will in effect see what came into the whole Kingdom, the Out-Ports
bearing a proportion of a 3d to that of London: and by finding that we
have so much Hemp from the East Countries now we are put to it to go to
Market there with ready Money instead of our woollen Manufactures as
formerly, (as we likewise do for our Pitch and Tar, and Masts) find that
we are more closely concerned in point of interest, to have our Hemp
provided at home.
And it will appear high time for us to begin somewhat like a Linen
Manufacture, when a running view of this Account presents us with so
great a quantity of old Sheets imported from Holland and France (tho
perhaps designed by us for our Plantations) and of Linen Yarn and some
Linen from Scotland: and since in that year by an Abstract of the exportations
of Ireland I have seen, that Country so long unsettled, had yet so much Linnen
Yarn and Linen Cloth for its own use, that 522 pieces of Linen Cloth of
40 Ells in a Piece, and 4 Thousand 6 Hundred, and 25 Hundred weight
of Linen Yarn then were thence exported.
The Account I mentioned is as followeth, viz.

That little sowing of Hemp and Flax here that hath been, hath alrea|dy
met with as much encouragement as this comes to namely, that 'tis
all bought up by the years end: and in our way to the Manufactures of
Hemp, the above Account doth so far encourage us as to let us see that
almost all our Cordage is made in England; and since by some Accounts
I have seen of the Importations in Amsterdam, almost as much Hemp
and Flax is there brought in yearly as into the whole Kingdom of England,
the necessity that will be driving us on to the Linen Manufacture, will be
accompanied with this comfortable Consideration, that as 'tis possible for
us to overtake France therein, so we may Holland (at least in the making of
Sail-Cloth) in regard we may if we will have as much Hemp and Flax
growing in our own Soil as they send for to Riga and elsewhere a|broad.
The French Protestants at Ipswich have lately made finer Linen than
ever was made in England, namely, of 15s. the Ell: and for which tho
they had their Linen Yarn from France, yet afterward they sowed Flax
near Ipswich whereof to make Yarn, and it was observed to grow so high,
that the People resorted from all parts adjacent of the Country to see it,
they having never seen any so high before.
A Judgment so penetrating as your Lordships will easily find how the
said Account may be many ways useful to the publick in point of Trade,
as for example, the Consideration is obvious that those Countries we re|ceive
no Hemp or Flax or their Manufactures from, we may profitably
in the way of Traffick hereafter carry them to, and by that means know
our proper Markets, as particularly Spain, Italy, Portugal, c.
That great Bankrupsy in London that hath thence like a Plague infected
so many of our Country Traders, and laid there too so much Land in
some sort desolate, will by natural necessity oblige them to countenance this
improvement of the Realm by new Commodities and Manufactures: and
that which hath in many of our poor Idlers, Created such an Aversion
from the sowing of Hemp and Flax, namely, the toyle of beating the
same, will soon cease by the acquainting them with the Invention of a
Mill near a Rivolet by which as much Hemp may be beaten in a day as
can be by two hundred men: and they who have been incessant in com|plaining
of others being French Pensioners, and thought themselves slight|ed
because they were not so, shall by the Protestants of that Nation thus
leading us by the hand to a rich Manufacture, find France to have thus
sent Donatives to our whole Land. And from the example of their innate
Loyalty to their Hereditary Monarch, and thankfulness to ours for their
protection, I doubt not but many of our Male-contents will imbibe princi|ples
of obedience to Government and a sense of their safety under that Asy|lum:
and such persons whatever their pretensions are, will deserve ill of the
Kingdom and its Trade and Manufacture, who by their excessive Com|plaints
of the danger of Popery and of the Fantome of that pretended Re|ligion
frighting us out of our Laws, shall really deter more such Protestant
Strangers from planting among us. But as men may be said to be deter|red
by shame from fearing any thing in throngs, and where they are se|cure
from robbery, and can suffer only by petty Larceny, so I believe will
this populous State of our Country insensibly wear off the excess of our
fears; and do expect such a future State in England as will make men asha|med
of their past fears, and their former deference to ill bodeing Pro|phets.
Gassendus in his Works tells us, that all the Astrologers of France concluded,
that by reason of the great Conjunction of watry signs in Piscis and Aquarius

in the Year 1524, that there should then be another deluge in that Realm,
and in Germany, in the Month of February, a rainy Month, and that many
of the People thereupon went with their Goods and Cattel from the Low Lands
to the hilly Country, and yet that Month proved the driest Month that ever
was known: and thus do I expect that many of our Melancholy Prophets
in England will be toto caelo, mistaken in their auguries. And if natural
Considerations did not induce me thus to foretel good to my Country,
another Consideration might tempt me to predict ill, namely, the warding
off all the risque of a false Prophet: for among the Iews if a man prophesied
of future ill to a Person or State, and it came not to pass, he was not there|fore
pronounced a false Prophet, by reason of the infinite goodness of|ten
inclining the Divine Nature to avert its threatned Anger; but if he
Prophesied of good Success, and it happened not, he was then reputed a
false Prophet, for that (they said) Heaven never cancelled a Decree of
Mercy.
Considering how often things at random predicted have come to pass,
and tho like Seeds carelessly thrown into the Field of Time have yet
grown up, and how many even of the higher Class of understandings,
have been tempted to believe the predictions of the illiterate, and that
such could read the Book of Fate who yet could read no other (as appear|ed
by Sir Thomas Moore and Bishop Fisher being tainted with some belief
of the holy Maid of Kent's Sayings, or at least seeming so to be) and that the
prediction of things as I partly before hinted may help as a Natural Cause
to give them Birth, I wishing so well to my Country and its Religion by
Law Established, have however adventured from Natural Causes to give
my judgment for the future State thereof as I have done, not despairing of
its influences on some present Despairers.
And moreover the Class of Magna nomina, who have faulter'd in their
measures of Prophecy, is so great that an obscure mistaken person may well
hope to hide himself among them
Father Parsons alis Doleman, in his Book of the Succession, doth p. 258. give
his final Conjecture of the great future Event of the Succession after the
death of Queen Elizabeth, saying, My opinion is that this Affair cannot possibly
be ended by any possibility moral without some War at leastwise for sometime at
the beginning, and gives his reasons for that his opinion. And how all our hot
Apocalyptick Men and Teazers of Anti-Christ have erred in the times of the
great Changes they have predicted in the World, is obvious: and therefore
the most sagacious of that sort of Expositers, have made the things they
have foretold to be far distant in time, and before which they knew they
should long be in the number of Non entes doctores, as one calls the School|men:
and thus likewise the ingenious Author of the Treatise of Taxes and
Contributions, printed in London 1667, doth p. 23. say, that Before five hun|dred
years we may be all transplanted from hence into America, these Coun|tries
being over-run with Turks and made wast as the Seats of the famous
Eastern Empires at this day.
Mr. Herbert, our pious Vates, made Religion standing a tiptoe to take its flight
thither many years ago. And the ingenious Author of the Zelanders Choice
hath therein told us that the French would never part with Vtrecht, and
that our King's Declaration of Indulgence would never be recalled; but the
contrary happened in both Cases, and the Vote of the House of Commons
in order to his Majesties recalling the latter, was carried by the Party there
favouring the Nonconformists, and could not have been without them,
which that Author did not foresee, and that those Nonconformists would
be well neither full nor fasting, and therefore their reflections on the King's

Ministers for denying Indulgence to them since, ought to be very
gentle.
Mr. Fox in his Martyrology in one Volume p. 694. gives us this conje|ctural
prediction that the Turk will seize Rome, and founds one of his rea|sons
for it on the 18 Ch. of the Rev. and that he shall consume it with
fire, and Ribera the Iesuite in Chap. 14th of the Rev. saith, Romam igitur
non tantum propter priora peccata conflagratarum esse magno incendio, sed etiam
propter illa quae extremis illis temporibus commissura est ex hujus Apocalypsis
verbis adeo perspicue cognoscimus, ut ne stulissimus quidem negare possit.
Neither Mr. Fox nor the Iesuite name any particular time when Rome shall
be consumed with Fire: but many whose Enthusiastic fancies have played
with the fire of Rome, adventured to lay the Scene of its ruine in the
Year 1666: and to assert this, a Latin Book was professedly writ and called,
Romae ruina finalis Anno Dom. 1666. and printed in London in the Year
1663. in the Title whereof 'tis said, that Rome shall be incendio delenda,
in the Year 1666.
And no doubt our many Prophetic Writers that read that Sentence as
from Gods Tribunal, that Rome shall be destroyed that year, angered the
Conclave there; and they might well think that to such hot heads there be|longed
incendiary hands; and accordingly as it was before cited out of
the Pamplet called, The Arts and pernicious designs of Rome, wherein is
shewn what are the Aims of the Iesuites, c. the Author makes the Con|flagration
of London (in case it were a practice of Humane Contrivance) to
have been caused by Rome and the Consistory there, and the Iesuites as being
willing to signalize that year of 666, with some remarkable mischief done to
Protestants in check to the fancies of some that predicted Romes utter destru|ction
then, 'tis possible that they might grant against our City the reprisal
of performances for our Prophecies against theirs: which if they did was
a Revenge very disproportionate; for according to that rule of the Pha|risees
revenge, namely, an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth, they
should only have equipped Airy Prophecies against us, and not Fire-ships,
and by a little obvious Art have hounded the number of the Beast 666 upon
us. And though I am sufficiently convinced by the Quotations out of the
Canon Law, and the Canonists referred to in Gundissalvus that the Tenet of
burning whole Cities if the Majority thereof are Hereticks, is chargeable on
the Church of Rome as approved by it, and tho the Lord Chancellor and two
Houses of Commons, and the Magistrates of London have given their judg|ment
of the Causers of that Fire as aforesaid, and tho one of our great
Divines and whose Name all Protestants in our Land must mention with
great honour, Dr. William Lloyd Dean of Bangir, hath in his Funeral
Sermon of Sir Edmund Godfrey p. 38. speaking of the incredible patience
found in the Citizens of London at the time of its Conflagration, as an effect
of the Protestant Religion, further said, Tho so many believed and very few
much doubted whence it came, that it was from the same hands which we justly
suspect for this wickedness (meaning the Murder of Sir Edmund Godfrey) yet
was there no Tumult rose upon it, no violence done that extended to the life of
any Person, yet shall I never without the knowledge of convincing proofs
of such a Fact projected, or modelled by some in Authority in the Church
of Rome, and the Spiritual Guides of our Lay-Papists, charge the Odium
of the Fact on more of them than make the least of numbers, nor yet the
allowance of this Tenet on the generality of Papists here at home, or
abroad in the World, and would say that as infallible as the Pope was, he
knew not what spirit he was of, when he thus in his Law called for fire on
Heretical Cities; I allude to our Saviour's words to the Disciples that

importun'd him to call for Fire from Heaven to burn the Samari|tans.
I know the Roman Catholick Author of the forementioned Pamphlet,
called the Arts of Rome, c. in the Epistle of it, saith of the Jesuites and
Fryars, that what they hold lawful to be done, they may be justly presumed to do
whensoever opportunity serves, and that they see it conducible to their Inter|est
to do it. Thus likewise Iudges of Ecclesiastical Courts when the consi|deration
of the Nullity of a Marriage by reason of fear resulting from
threatnings is before them, do carefully regard this point concerning the
Menacer, an solitus est minas exequi, a thing the Iesuites have not been
wanting to do, when Power and Opportunity have not been wanting:
and there is no doubt but the Iesuites by reason of their 4th Vow to the
Pope, over and above the Implicit Obedience they have sworn to their Su|periors,
are to execute whatever he shall command: nor is it doubtable
but that when it is said by the Canonists that the Pope hath power to burn
Heretical Cities, he will reduce that Power into Act when he sees conve|nient;
and as Dr. Donne in his Pseudo Martyr well notes, the Lawyers
teach us that the word potest doth often signifie actum: for which he quotes
Bartolus on the Digests.
I believe the truth of his Computation where he saith in p. 228 of that
Book, That the Iesuites are in possssion of most of the Papists hearts in Eng|land,
but I likewise believe his other Computation in that Book, where in
p. 127. he saith, quoting Rebadenira, that in the Year 1608. the whole num|ber
of the Society of the Iesuites were 10581. and that tho their number
is much encreased since, there are not so many in England as were when
the Book was printed, viz Anno 1610. and the Dr. whose Style was as
the Oxford Antiquities say of Mr. Foxes, in Romanenses satis acerbus, (tho
I think neither of their Styles was so a jot too much) doth in Chap. 10th of
that Book, very learnedly and largely shew that many Eminent and Popish
Writers have bitterly inveighed against Gratian the Compiler of the Decre|tum
of the Canon Law.
No doubt that Law was never in gross received in England, in the times
of our Popish Ancestors, and so neither did nor doth bind English Papists
in the Court of Conscience, more than the Council of Trent doth in some
Popish Countries where it never was received: and I find Bellarmine cited
by the Dr. for saying, that there are many things in the Decretal Epistles
which do not make a matter to be de fide, but only do declare what the opinions
of the Popes were in such cases.
I believe that no un-jesuited Papist (nor perhaps some sober Party in
that Order) will think the worse of me for calling the Decretum of the
Popes Canon Law, by reason of its empowering him thus to burn Cities,
hrrendum Decretum: and it may perhaps appear ridiculous as well as horrid
in the Pope in that Law, to rake in the Ashes of sweet St. Cyprian for fire to
burn Heretical Towns, and to make him, who was in a manner Excommuni|cated
by the Pope for rebaptizing such as were baptized by Hereticks, to be
the Founder of that wild Tenet of converting guiltless Lime, and Brick and
Timber to rubbish, because they had afforded dwelling places to People, that
differed in judgment from Rome: and to make him, who in the Year 258.
was a Martyr for not being an Idolater, to be the Author of burning Cities,
that would not adore the Host.
But moreover it may be said that in the Decrets made by the Pope to Ape
the Pandects, and to consist chiefly of Canons of Councils, sayings of Fa|thers,
and Constitutions of Popes as the Pandects do of the responsa pruden|tum,
c. Gratian's founding a Tenet on Cyprian, or any places out of other

Authors, giveth it only the weight that Cyprian and they had in their
proper works: and the Stream of Authority from their Writings in
Gratian is not to be supposed able to rise higher than the Spring: and
thus the Canonists agree on this as a Rule, that the things quoted in
Gratian, Vim legis habent quatenus reperiuntur illic unde depompta sunt:
and they tell us, that if any things that are said to be impia, hiulca, barbara,
sine ratione, falsa fideique Historicae adversa, are found there, they are to
be passed by as Gratian Dreams, ut nec confirmatio Pontificum generalis ad
ea sese extendere possit. And on this Account his Glssographer Andreas,
himself doth often turn his gloss into an Animadversion on his Master (for
that name he bestows on Gratian) and saith sometimes, Magister hic non
tenetur (meaning Observatur) and sometimes Superficialis est magistri ar|gumentatio,
and elsewhere with a strain of Ruffianism, fateor te plane menti|tum
Gratiane.
And if any one will read Pere Veron's Book of the Rule of Catholick
Faith, Dedicated to the Lords of the Assembly general of the Clergy sitting
at Paris in the Year 1645. he will find, he saith, as for Gratian's Decrees,
and the Gloss, they can claim nothing of Faith, the Author being a particular
Doctor and Subject to many mistakes even in the Citation of Authors, nor doth
he pretend to any such thing: much less weight hath the Gloss than the Decrees,
where many silly and ridiculous passages are discovered. As for the Papal Decrees
contained in the body of the Canon Law, or published since, none of them do con|stitute
an Article of Faith, c. Bellarmine makes no difficulty to acknowledge
Errors in several of them: as for example, where the Canon out of Gratian
is objected, quod proposuisti, extracted out of Gregory the 3d, where 'tis
said, that if a Woman should be sick and by that means unable to render her
duty to her Husband, the Husband if he have not the gift of continency may
take another Wife: he replys thus, that the Pope failed through ignorance,
which we do not deny may happen to Popes, when they do not properly define
but only declare their opinions, as Gregory seems here to have done.
And no doubt but every Papist laughs at the definition of a Whore in
the Decrets, i. e. Quae multorum libidini patet, and at the gloss there ma|king
by multorum to be meant 23000.
My Lord, I discoursed frankly of all these last mentioned matters to
my Roman Catholick Friend, who (I said) would joyn Issue in the Plea
about Religion, if the Pope's Power of firing Heretical Cities, were a
Tenet chargeable on the Church of Rome, and have perhaps said as much
to throw off the Obligation on any Papists to obey the Pope or his Canon
Law, in the infliction of such dire Vengeance on whole Cities, as they
would wish said, and do think my self indispensably obliged when I dis|course
with any of Mankind about any Quaesitum relating to natural truth,
and much more to Theological, with all possible candour to say what the
matter will fairly bear on both sides, as accounting any mans Judgment
given ex parte to be of little or no value, and esteeming him a falsarius,
who conceals any thing of truth.
But this Gentleman being a close pursuer of truth told me, he knew
well enough that the Canon Law did not as such bind all Papists in foro con|scientiae,
but he would stay in no Church that he should find to be built in
any Akeldama, or Field of Blood, that is, a Church that approved of Tenets
destructive of Civil Societies, or condemned not Tenets that where any
other Religion than the Popes was, would Condemn men like Nebuchad|nezor
to grasing and to solitude, or if they would live in Towns or Cities,
make them live there in Houses under Ground, as Dr. Browne in his Travels
saith, He saw some Towns in the Turkish Dominions where Christians so lived

like the Troglodytes, and subterraneous Nations about Egypt, and which
might be occasioned by many Armies marching that way and burning of
Towns en passant; and that till the Pope disclaimed this power, and dam|ned
such Tenet in his Canon Law, that hung up there a Light conspicuous
to the World, for the lawful kindling of the Torches that should set fire
to Heretical Cities, such Cities as he called Heretical would be in fear of
their being incendio delendae; and that in the mean time the Iesuites, who
assert the plenitude of his power, would implicitly obey his Commands,
and their Emissaries execute theirs, without considering whether Gratian as
a Fool, or a Knave misapplied Cyprian: and he granted that if, as an Univer|sal
Censor morum, the Pope did Command the Iesuites or others to inflict
spiritual Censures in Cases of Sin, or Non-belief of any Religionary No|tion,
and those Censures were not to operate beyond the Soul, that Civil
Societies might yet be maintained; but to give the Pope power to issue out
Orders to burn the Cities and Towns, where the Roman Catholick Reli|gion
is not professed, is (said he,) to give him Arbitrary Power over a
great part of the World, and to leave it to his Arbitrage, whether there
shall be any Political Government and Commerce in the States and King|doms
of Hereticks, and the World might suffer Confusion by the Papa|cy's
having this power de facto, as much as if it had it de jure, and that
several places have been burned as Heretical, and when certainly they had
a right not to be so served, and particularly the Heretical Villages at the
Massacre of Merindol, of which Dr. Heylin in his Geoghraphy in Folio,
makes mention, saying, that in the Year 1560. there were above 1250
Churches of the Hugonots in France, which cannot in such a long time but be
wonderfully augmented, tho scarce any of them have scaped some Massacre or
other. Of these Massacres two are most memorable, viz. that of Merindol
and Chabiers, as being the first, and that of Paris as being the greatest. That
of Merindol happened in the Year 1545. the instrument of it being Minier,
the President of the Council of Aix: for having Condemned those poor people of
Heresy, he mustered a small Army and set fire on the Villages. He directed
me further for the proof of that Fact to Maimbourg's History of Calvi|nism,
Book 2d, where he mentions the Decree of the Parliament of Aix
to which Heylin refers, and saith Maimbourg of it, Par le quel il Condamn'
par Contumace dix neuf de Ces Heretiques  estre braslz, c. ordonne que
toutes les Maisons de Merindol qui sont toutes remplies de Ces Heretiques soient
entierement dmolies,  renverses de fond en comble, c.
He further said, that there was another guess Fire projected by the Je|suites,
as was before mentioned out of Thuanus, and which was abetted by
the Pope, which shewed there was another Pope beside Eugenius, that
thought the burning of Heretical Cities lawful and meritorious: and he
referred it to the Consideration of the Criticks in Gun-powder, how far so
great a quantity of it lodged in a strait Vault, might have tended to the
demolishing of the Heretical Cities of Westminster and even of Lon|don,
if the experiment of the Gun-powder Treason had took effect,
for said he, the utmost power of Gun-powder was never yet tryed. He
told me that Osborn in his King Iames, having spoke of the Gun-powder
Treason saith, I never met two of the like conceit concerning any effect or extent,
this Powder might have reached had it not failed of success: some men confining
it to the Circle it lay in and no farther: whereas the judgment of others no
less experienced, delivered at least the whole Isle to the fury of it: and then
he quotes it as the more probable Conjecture, then that it could not but work
dire effects on the City it self.

He further discoursed that in this Case, of securing Protestant Cities
from Fire at the Popes pleasure, Pere Veron's artifice in making the Church
of Rome, chargeable with nothing to be believed but what is proposed by the
Catholick Church in her general Councils, or by her Vniversal Practice to be
believed, as an Article or Doctrine of Catholick Faith, or any Papists in
this Case joyning with Protestants to decry the Canon Law, is but trifling
away time, as to any giving light to our understandings or keeping Fire
from our Cities: for if each Pope believes he hath this power, and the Je|suites
too believe it, the Notion of a things not being de fide, will not be suf|ficient
to save our Cities, when the Incendiaries even by the Doctrine of
probability may save their Souls, and when they shall have such Doctors as
the Pope and Gratian and (as they may think) Cyprian for the opinion of
burning the Nests of Heretical Hornets.
He moreover mentioned how Bellarmine as to the Tenet of all Christian
Monarchies owing subjection to the Pope, said, the contrary to it is Heretical,
tho he well knew that no definition of the Church ever made it Heresy,
and might as well have called the denial of this Incendiary Power of the
Pope against Heretical Cities, to be Heresy.
Moreover he told me he had read Bellarmine cited in that Book of Donne
p. 277. for writing against a Doctor, who had defended the Venetian Cause
against the Popes Censures, and reprimanding that Doctor in these words,
viz. It is a grievous rashness not to be left unpunished, that he should say the
Canons as being but Humane Laws cannot have equal Authority with divine:
for this is a Contempt of the Canons, as tho they were not made by the direction
of the Holy Ghost: and yet saith Donne, citing that Doctor that impugned the
Canons, those Canons that he referred to were but two, and cited but by
Gratian. And that Donne further in that Page observed, that when Parsons
is to make his advantage of any Sentence in Gratian, he uses to dignify it
thus, that it is translated by the Popes into the Corps of the Canon Law, and
so not only allowed and admitted and approved but commended and commanded,
canonized and determined for Canonical Law, and authorized and set forth for
Sacred and Authentical by all Popes whatsoever. Treat. of Mitag. ca. 7.
. 42.
That moreover tho we know that neither the Decrets nor Decretals,
were ever as such received as Law in England, yet the Pope and Jesuites
saying that they ought so to have been, and that they were and are obliga|tory
upon us, it will follow that by reason of an unlucky Proverb of Ben
Syrah, Quantulus ignis quantam materiam accendit, and which is used by the
Apostle St. Iames saying Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth, and
for that there are some little People ready to apply that little fire, when
the Pope or Jesuites would have them, the Majority of the Papists here,
being Jesuited (as was observed) and that part of them not being of the
Gentry, would not be byassed by generous education and temper against
the Commands of the mercenary Pope or Jesuites, and for that even in the
Jesuited Gentry here, there were Bigots found to plot and to prepare to
execute the Gun-powder Treason, it is apparent that the Pope may if he
will be very troublesome to our Cities with his Writ de Civitate comburen|d,
and that he or the Jesuites can command numbers of instruments to ex|ecute
that his Writ (as I may call it) who will think that therein that
they do as lawful an Act, as if the four first General Councils had expresly
warranted the same.
He said that the Popes Decrets and Decretals are in several Popish Coun|tries
so much regarded, that to encourage men to study the same, Academick
Degrees are conferred, namely, of Doctores decretorum, and Doctores decreta|lium.

That in France where the Canon Law was never in gross received;
as Minier the President of the Council of Aix did set fire on the Heretical
Villages as such, so he hath heard that Boerius an eminent Lawyer of France,
and President of a Parliament there, and who has published a Volume of
Decisions, hath in Tractatu de seditiosis asserted this Tenet of the Pope's
power to burn Heretical Cities. That the Christians of old when they
groaned under the heaviest weight of the Pagan Persecution, abhorred
this revenge against their idolatrous Enemies, as appeared by Tertullian's
Apology, and their sense of the ease with which this revenge might have
been executed, Quando vel una nox pauculis faculis largitatem ultionis posset
operari, si malum malo dispungi penes nos liceret, sed absit ut aut igni humano
vindicetur Divina secta, i. e. One night with a few Fire-brands would yield
us sufficient Revenge, if it were lawful for us to discount evil with evil: but
God forbid that the followers of the Divine Religion should either revenge
themselves with Humane Fire, c. That the very Heathens of old ac|counted
there was turpitude in promoting not only their own profit, but
that of their Country, in firing the Fleet of proclaimed Enemies; as ap|peared
in Athens when Themistocles by order from the Senate, had private|ly
Communicated to Aristides how he could destroy the Lacedemonians by
privately burning their Fleet, and Aristides had reported to the Senate that
the project of Themistocles communicated to him was profitable for the State,
but was not honest, they unanimously resolved against hearing it (as Tully
tells us in his Offices) and much less would they have deliberated of its
turpitude. That the Athenians in the time of open War with King Philip,
and when their Priests offering their most solemn religious Sacrifices to
the Gods for the prosperity of their Country, did Philippum liberos, ter|restres
navals copias at omnem Macedoniam exitiali carmine  diris im|precationibus
detestari, yet intercepting some Letters writ by him, they re|turned
them to him unopen'd.
That the Pope and his Trent Council having never disown'd this power,
nor branded this Canon, nor yet by any index expurgatorius, damned the
Writings of Gratian, or Gundissalvus or the Famous Canonists by him ci|ted
for this opinion, it was plain that they might therefore be said to ap|prove
of the same, that Qui non prohibet cum potest jubet.
That the Trent Council had gone far in the Confirmation of the Canon
Law; and that the saying used by the Fathers in that Council, was here
applicable, viz. Omnia nostra facimus, quibus authoritatem nostram imper|timur.
In fine, he saying that every one ought to withdraw from a Church
while it in effect approved Doctrines in the Faith erroneous, and in pra|ctice
impious, and asking me if some of the Great Writers of the Church
of England, as namely, Bishop Iewel, Bishop Andrews, Arch-Bishop Lad,
Bishop Sanderson, or any of them had industriously published it in
Print, that we might lawfully employ Emissaries to burn Rome, or any
City where all or the Majority were Papists, and that such Writing of
theirs was never censured by Authority, and impugned by any of our
Divines, tho yet by occasion thereof no Anti-Papists had ever been
the Incendiaries of Popish Cities, I would not however withdraw from
the Communion of the Church of England, till I saw such Tenet of those
Divines publickly branded, and till such Writing had received the usage
that the Canon Law had from Luther, when he cast it into the Flames; I
plainly told him that I would: and the like he said he was inclined to as
to Communion with the Church of Rome, if he found that the Fact of
that fiery Tenet against Heretical Cities, was chargeable on the Pope in

his Law and in the Writers thereupon as aforesaid. And as little Credit
as I wish all Mushroom Prophets and Prophecies may find, I am of opinion,
if ever any clear discovery should happen in time to be made of that Fires
having proceeded from the Councils of great numbers of Iesuites, Friars,
or other Papists, (a thing I never Expect) that Popery would thereby
be loaded with such a lasting general Odium here and in Forraign Coun|tries
both Popish and Protestant, as it would hardly breath under the
weight of, and the Prophets of the effects of the Year 1666, would cry
that their predictions did hit right, and boldly say to us their upbraiders,
that 66 in its effects is not yet past, just like the Sooth-sayer who being
rallied by Caesar going to the Senate-House, and saying, the Ides of
March were come, replied to him, that they were not passed.
There is another happy effect, I expect from the grown and growing
numbers of our populous Nation, and all mens errors, being necessarily
the more visible to each other by their close Vicinage, namely, that men
will be ashamed to aggravate the supposed Political Errors of the Mini|sters
of our Princes as formerly, and much more not to take it patiently
when their Princes pardon them.
How shameful a thing was it that the Kings Pardon was not allowed as
good, by the Lords and Commons, to Arch-Bishop Laud, when nothing but
that could save them from the danger of the Laws, for taking away any
mans life by Ordinance of Parliament.
But so sharp and perfect a haer is your Lordship of all Cruel and Ar|bitrary
Practices, that I think I have heard you say, that you have often
wondered why none ever moved in the House of Lords, that the Pro|ceedings
there against Arch-Bishop Laud might be took out of their Iour|nal,
as well as those against the Earl of Strafford were, which was to me
an Indication that you would have consented to such a Motion.
Mr. Fox in his Bok of Martyrs in one Volume, p. 1085. in the Story of
the life and death of the Lord Cromwel (who was Vice-Gerent to Harry
the 8th, for Ecclesiastical Affairs) brings many instances of the cruel in|justice
by Acts of Attainder, that many Great and Excellent Men suffered:
and hath these words in the Margent, Examples of men falsly Accused and
Iudged, and aith in that p. Not that I here speak or mean against the High
Courts of Parliament of this our Realm, c. to whom I always attribute their
due Reverence and Authority: but as it happens sometimes in General Councils,
which tho they be never so general, yet sometimes they may and do erre, so they
that say Princes and Parliaments may be misinformed sometimes by some
Sinister Heads in matters Civil and Politick, do not therein derogate or im|pair
the High Estate of Parliaments, but rather give wholesome Admoni|tions
to Princes and Parliament Men, to be more Circumspect and Vigilant
what Council they shall admit, and what Witnesses they do Credit.
This passage out of our pious Martyrologer makes me with a just Com|passion
to the Merits of several Illustrious Persons, to call to mind the se|verity
of the Votes of a Loyal Parliament against them.
It was with great precaution and solemnity, that the Athenian Wisdom
fastened the name of Enemy on any one; and of which the frequent im|position
and on slight occasions, and on persons not known to have done
any Act of Hostility to the Kingdom, would make the word lose the
Odium of its signification, as many Words and Phrases have done, and to
import no more stated hatred or enmity in any man to his Coun|try,
than do the expressions of Course put into Writs of Prohibition;
or Mandamuses, to our Bishops and their Officials, viz. Of intending
our disherison, or machinating against our Crown and Dignity mean

any thing of Treason in them which yet the words so expresly im|port.
Tully tells us in his Offices, that the Original use of the Word Hostis, for
one who was perduellis, came from the lenity of the Romans: hostis enim
(saith he) apud majores nostros is dicebatur quem nunc peregrinum dicimus:
and according to this acception of the Word Enemy for Stranger, I shall
venture to say that I think they were Strangers to the Earl of Hallifax,
and persons misinform'd (as Mr. Fox his Expression was) who in the
late Loyal House of Commons did think him to be hostis patriae, and whom
they who know him, do know likewise to bear no Enmity to any part of
the Creation of God, and to be one that is so far from any inclination to
injure his Country for his Prince, that either or his Prince or his Country
he would not injure the most abject Member of Mankind.
How shamefully void of sense have I observed some few querulous people
here to be, who have professed to doubt that a very honourable man hath
of late remitted somewhat of his fervour, in the defence of our Religion
and Laws, who hath so long on every occasion in every place been such an
unwearied Agonist for both, and one who would not fear to be an Atha|nasius
contra mundum, whenever he should in his Province be lawfully cal|led
to be its Antagonist; and that with contempt too even of the Bribe
of Popularity: and of the continuance of whose confirm'd and obstinate
habit of an Heroical Love to his Country, they who have long known
him have never doubted, but have agreed in this point of his perseverance
in what Tully calls the pietas in patriam, to pronounce as the warier Armi|nians
do concerning Grace, viz. that there is a State of Grace attainable in
this life, from which it is difficult if not impossible to fall away.
With as little Art and faint Colours as I have here drawn the Picture of
this Great Man, any one will say it is very like the Earl of Radnor: and the
truth is, considering that this same pietas in patriam, and the inflexible ob|servation
of Justice, have not been so much incarnate in the lives of later
Christians, as of ancient Heathens, nor perhaps so legible in their Wri|tings,
(and therefore as if that Practice of Piety had been too among
Pancirols Res deperditae, Boccaline held it a proper Advertisement, That
all the Princes of the World should beseech Apollo, that he would insert
into their People the love of their Country) when I would occasionally in
discourse do Justice to this Great Exemplar of it, I endeavour to whet my
imagination with thoughts out of the Roman Authors, and do think of
Cotumacy in Vertue (according to Pliny's using that word in a good sense)
and of the inexplebilis virtutis veraeque laudis homo, and of the foremen|tioned
sooner making Crimen honestum, quam turpem Catonem, and of the
multa  terribilia Piso Contemsit, dum speciosum mentis suae flecti non vult ri|gorem,
and of what is in Valerius Maximus of Scipio Africanus, quem Dii
immortales nasci voluerunt ut esset in quo se virtus per omnes numeros homini|bus
efficaciter ostenderet, and of Ciceros accounting the pietas in patriam to
be the via ad Caelum.
Some here who Correspond with Sir W. I. asking me if I had not
heard that you were prayed for at Mass in Ireland, I told them I had, and
that the Earl of Essex mentioned the same in the House of Lords, and that
your Lordship replied, that if any well meaning Papists in their Mass-house,
or Iews in their Synagogue, or Mahumetans in their Mosc unask'd and un|sought
to, pray'd for you, you would be glad to be the better by their Devo|tion,
tho yet you believed that none of them did ever, yet supplicate Heaven
in your behalf. I told my friends here that if that thing had been true
(and tho on the account of what hath been beforementioned, I believed

it not to be so in the least) yet they would soon cease to infer thence that
your Lordships love for the Protestant Religion was diminished, if they
would reflect on the Case of Rawlins White in the Acts and Monuments,
where it appears that the Bishop of Landaff in the Year 1555. just before
he Condemned the said Rawlins to the Fire as an Heretick, ordered a
Priest to say a Mass for him: and as that Bishop in vain Courting him a
little before, to abandon the Protestant Faith, and then asking him how he
dd, and how he found himself inclined, the poor Captive replied, Rawlins
you lft me, and Rawlins you find me, and Rawlins I will continue; that
thus constant your Lordship will prove to your Religion and your self, up|on
any thing that can happen; and that whoever shall write the Story of
your Lordships life after you have finished your Mortality, will have cause
to say of you as Mr. Fox p. 411. mentions, that one who writes of Wicliff
recorded of him that he persevered in his Religion, ita ut cano placeret
quod Iuveni complacebat, that the same thing pleased him in his old Age,
which did in his youth.
Nor do I indeed doubt but that when your Lordship shall be upon your
passage to the other World, you will take your long leave of your friends
in the Style with which Dr. Holland the Regius Professor of Divinity at
Oxford was observed commonly to bid his friends farewel, viz. Commendo
vos amori Dei  odio Papatus; and that your Lordship who hath been so
successful an Agonist against Popery, will share in the Glories of that Pro|mise
from Heaven, To him that overcomes will I give the Morning Star:
and that as the Morning Star is the same with the Evening one, and in the
Morning is call'd Phosphorus, and in the Evening Hesperugo, so the Protestant
Religion will appear in the Evening of your Life, with the same brightness
that it did in the Morning thereof, and so continue till you shall arrive at that
Region, where all the Morning Stars sang together, and all the Sons of God
shouted for joy.
How unreasonably rigid are they who when the Ministers of Princes
are studying and procuring the ease of Mankind, as your Lordship hath
done, will in spight of fate disquiet themselves in rendring the lives of
such Ministers uneasie; a temper that I think shewed it self over much in
a late Speech in the House of Commons, of Sir W. I. who, if my Informa|tion
be true, did not reverently use the power of his Popularity, when
with much Acrimony reflecting on some in the Kings Council, he was sup|posed
to have aimed at your Lordship in words to this effect, There is ano|ther
in the Council a Noble Man too among the Kings Ministers, and a Lawyer,
but if we cannot reach him, do not impeach him; intimating that he would
have been glad of any being able with Articles and Proofs concludent, to
have reached your Lordship in order to Impeachment.
There is another Honourable Person who is your Collegue in the
King's Council, a Great Man and a Lawyer too, whom I was sorry to find
by the printed Votes of the House of Commons that were sent into the Coun|try,
so many persons were endeavouring to reach with matter of Impeach|ment,
I mean, my Lord Chief Iustice North. It seem'd to me a thing
worthy the name of News, that the advising and assisting in the drawing up
and passing a Proclamation against Tumultuous Petitions, should be thought
a sufficient ground to proceed upon to an Impeachment against him for
high Crimes and Misdemeanors.
The security and quiet of Kings and their People are to be so tenderly re|garded,
that the drawing one Proclamation after another to prevent the
blowing or breathing in the Kings Face (I allude to the words in one
of the Articles against Woolsy) by Tumultuous Petitioners (a thing

punishable at Common-Law, and likewise by the severity of the Council-Board)
seems strangely imputed as a Crime to a Judge and Privy Coun|cellor.
The people petitioning in Multitudes are so far from being like the Horse
not knowing his own strength, that their coming in such numbers shews
they have Calculated it, and perhaps with more nicety than the Author of
the Discourse before the Royal Society, concerning the use of Duplicate
Proportion had Calculated the strength of Animals, the which strength he
saith, is as the square roots of their weights and substance, and if 1728 Mice
were equiponderate to one Horse, the said Horse is but 1/144 part as strong as all
the said Mice; and so might easily strip the Horses Neck of the Thunder
that God and Nature (according to Iobs expression) have cloathed it with;
and their petitioning in numbers being a real Proclamation of their power,
it was the part of so good a Councellor of State, and Mathematician to ad|vise
his Prince and his Country not to be taken in a Trap by the Petitioning
Mice: and it was worthy of so knowing a Iudge, to forewarn them of be|ing
entrapped by the Law, and as the Millenary Petitioners were fore|warn'd
in King Iames his time.
What occasioned the Proclamation referred to by the House of Commons,
I know not; but by what I have observed of his accurateness in the ad|ministration
of Justice in his great Sphere, and of his Mathematical
Genius even not receeding from it self while on the Tribunal he in every
Cause demonstrates the rationality of the Laws of England, and makes Ju|stice
there in its Arithmetical and Geometrical proportion so visible to all,
and by what I have seen of the serenity of his temper in having had once or
twice the honour of his Conversation, I believe that as a Privy Councel|lor
he would too as much occasionally assert any Legal Right the Subject
hath to Petition his Prince, as he would the Right of the latter not to be
illegally and with the apparent Menace of Members addrest to, a way
of Petitioning that hath so often and so lately been the Prologue to the en|suing
Tragedy of War.
I was very much pleased to hear how this Learned Iudge, being once
moved to grand a Prohibition to the Court Christian in a certain Cause, and
that the Council fencing with Presidents pro and con that came not home
to the point, his Lordship declared in words to this purpose, that in any
proceeding that was against Universal Reason he would grant the Writ;
and I think it was as proper for him as a States-man to advise a Prohibition
in the way of a Proclamation against Tumultuous Petitions, than which no|thing
can be more against Vniversal Reason. But if a person who is so
great a Master of that Reason, and indeed of Universal Learning, and of
that part of it that deserves the name of Real, and whose single Learning
would serve to vindicate a whole profession from Erasmus his Aspersion of
doctissimum gnus indoctorum hominum, and of knowing nothing of the Sense
and Reason of the World beyond Dover, and the brightness of whose
parts hath given a Lustre to the Science of the Law, and by whom if by
any of this Age that may be thought possible to be done that our Great
Lord Bacon advised King Iames to Crown his Reign with, namely, the
bringing the Body of the Common Law, or our jus non scriptum into a Di|gest,
I say if a person thus accomplished cannot have the skill to walk
through the World free from Impeachment, it will be sufficient to make
all men of Illustrious Abilities and Godlike Inclinations to do good, retire
from dangerous Mankind, and not adventure to Aid Princes who are Gods
Vice-Roys in the Government of the World, and to be happy in themselves
without preserving it, as the first being was before he made it.

What a diminution was it to the honour of the Age, that the Popularity
of Sir W. I. a person who in the florid part of his youth, appeared but an
Entring Clerk, or one who entred Judgments for Attorneys, and in the
greatest Figure he made in Parliament, or the Court acquired no fame by
various Learning and Skill in the Politicks, or by having profoundly stu|died
the great Book of the World, should yet as with the Impetus of an
Oracle run down the great Characters of this Lord, and of your Lordship
and the Earl of Hallifax, that are known to the World to be so great for
Loyalty and Learning, and the Comprehensive Knowledge of the present
and past State of Christendom: and that after that Loyal and Learned
Person, and undefatigable assertor of our Laws and Religion, Sir L. Ien|kins
had with great Reason and Courage in a Speech in the House of Com|mons
against the Exclusion Bill affirmed, that the passing the same would be
contrary to the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and Sir W. I. there|upon
answering it with the Non est haeres viventis, he had somewhat like
a general humme of Applause from the House, and almost as if his had
been the voice of God and and not of Man?
But on this occasion I should be unjust and too reserved to your Lord|ship,
if I should not tell you that a Gentleman of good parts and a great
Estate, a Member of that Parliament, acquainted me that he being then
one of the great Admirers and Followers of Sir W. I. and frequently
present with him in the most private Cabals, did observe him to be full of
fears of the Courts being brought to favour the Exclusion-Bill, as suppo|sing
that the Parliament would be thereby engaged to part with great
Sums of Money: and that he observed Sir W. I. and others of the Cabal,
were at a stand in their Politicks as not knowing what steps to make next
if that Bill had passed, and the Consideration whereof (he told me)
made him not desirous to participate further in their Councils.
Thus just is it for Heaven sometimes to blind and confound and abandon
good men in their Councels, when they abandon plain Principles and Di|ctates
of Reason, and when they will not do what they know, to suffer
them not to know what they do, and particularly not to know while they
were so busily founding Dominion or Empire in Grace, that they were riding
Post to Rome as fast as ever that Father of the Trent-Council did, who was
so often employed to the Holy See to bring thence the Holy Ghost in a
Cloak-bag.
It is some Consolation to your Lordship to have fellow sufferers in the
Obloquy cast upon you, by the Tongue of a young Man, in a matter so re|mote
from verisimilitude, and not worth the twice naming, and whose
Person I thought not worthy the naming once, however a Loyal Parlia|ment
thought his Accusations worthy the Press: and in whose reproach
that Honourable Person, and your Lordships old friend the Earl of Peter|borough
shared with you. But by what I have found to be the judged
Character of that Lord, among the most Impartial Studiers of Men in the
Age, I may justly say that the honour of the Age was a fellow sufferer
with you both, by the publick Countenancing of the dirt by so obscure
a hand thrown on a Person of so Noble Descent both from Father and Mo|ther,
and of so much Courage and Loyalty and Learning, and on whom
his great knowledge of all History Ancient and Modern, hath so much
accomplished as a States-man, and one who in his Travels in the World
abroad left there such impressions of his real value on the most Critical
Observers, that his Prince thought him to be the most proper Person to
employ abroad as Ambassador, in negotiating the Marriage between his
Royal Highness and the Princess of Modena, whereby we may yet hope for

an Heir Male to inherit the Crown of England; I never heard that any
thing but sham could represent this Lord otherwise than a true Son of the
Church of England: and having once or twice seen him en passant at
your Lordships House, and observed the lineaments of Honesty and Ho|nour
in his looks, do think that his very face may serve to confute thou|sands
of such Tongues as that which aspersed him. But both his Lordship
and yours have likewise in that Persons Accusations, and in the greatest
Circumstances of improbability, been fellow sufferers with the greatest
Subject, and therefore need not be ashamed of your fate, according to
what the Famous Historian so well said, Post Carthaginem captam vinc ne|minem
pudeat.
Yet having said all this, I shall say that perhaps had it been the fortune
of that Loyal Parliament to have sate longer, it might too have happen|ed
that none of your Lordships that I have named would at last ave
thought it Parliamentum sine misericordia, and that I believe you will not
find any future one so, and that your Lordships who have so eminenty
supported the Northern Heresie so called, will be like the North Magnetick
and attract a general popular love, which after all its variations will re|turn
again to you.
But 'tis high time for me to take off my hand from this Map of the Fu|ture
State of England, that as a Predicter rather than a Prophet I have
here so particularly delineated, and as one who according to what is in
St. Mathew, When it is Evening, say it will be fair weather, for the Sky is
red, c. and from Natural Causes have as well as I could, discern'd the signs
of the times, and what it may be a shame for any one that is a piece of a
Philosopher to be wholly ignorant of, when the inspired Prophet tells us, that
the Stork knoweth her appointed times, and the Turtle and the Crane and
the Swallow observe the time of their coming, and that 'tis obvious that the
Beasts of the Field as well as Birds of the Air foresee unseasonable weather,
from the disposition of the Air.
Nor is it hard for any Considerer now in relation to some of the Popish
and Protestant Recusants to undertake what the Magicians, Astrologers,
and Chaldeans durst not to the King of Babylon, I mean to tell them what
their Dream was: they dreamt to rule us still by a Nation within a Nation
as the Mamalukes did Aegypt, they dreamt of Offices and like idle Millena|ries
of Lactantius his golden Age, when the Cliffs of the Mountains shall
sweat out Honey, and the Springs and Rivers shall flow with Milk and Wine,
and of a pingue solum that shall tire no Husbandmen, and of such a Coun|try
as Campania the Garden of Italy that shall not be called terra del lavoro.
But I do predict that the noise of the World, and their being necessarily di|sturbed
by the busie in whose way they stand will awaken them, and that
if they will have any food to raise the vapours, that will again feed sleep
in them, they must work for it, and that no Papists and Presbyterians
will in their sleep cry out of Persecution as formerly, and that no Papist
will hereafter applaud either the Justice or temper of Mr. Coleman in wri|ting
as aforesaid to the Inter-Nuncio, of the Execution of the Penal Laws
against the Papists, and saying, Which are so insupportable that 'tis impossi|ble
any that is reach'd by them to have wherewithal to eat Bread, if they be
executed according to the said Proclamation.
Nor I believe will such Complaining be heard in our Streets from any
of the Non-Conformist Divines, as I have read in Print from one Learned
Divine of them, viz. some of the ejected Ministers are so reduced and find
so little succour, that they live upon brown Bread and Water, some have died
through the effects of want, we will be thankful to be under no severer usage

than Colliers and Barge-men, and Sea-men, than begging Rogues and Vaga|bonds
have.
But as among the Augurs of old, the Poultreys not eating their Meat
or Bread, served as an indication that the Roman Army was not then to
fight, so I hope that the same thing was meant by the sullenness of Mr.
Colemans Augury and the others Complaint, and that both Papists and
Protestants will here eat the Bread of Quietness with Thanksgiving.
And considering the great number of Attorneys and Sollicitors and Deal|ers
towards the Law, that hath long over-spread the Land, and planted in
the same such a general proneness to litigation, and over-ran it so with
Briars and Thorns of the Law that our Country is not more famous for
our Wooll, than infamous for our so much fleecing one another, and con|sidering
how another thing hath occasionally put so many men to be skil|ful
Masters of the Science of Defence with the Weapons of the Law, I
mean the farming of so much of the publick Revenue, I may well predict
that if such a wild probability should happen as any Princes hereafter en|deavouring
by any illegal Course to advance Popery, that tho good and
loyal people would be Lachrymists to him, they would be soon apt to
make all ministerially concerned therein to be Lachrymists to them.
Altho England had a King, namely, Harry the 1st, of whom 'tis re|corded,
that reforming the old and untrue measures, he made a measure after
the length of his Arm, yet as we have one who hath graciously measured
the Arm of his Power by the Laws, so I may safely adventure to foretel
what his lawful Successors will do; and it is to this purpose in some of the
most subtle seditious Pamphlets notified in Print by the ill wishers to the
next Heir to the Crown, viz. that they fear more mischief from him as
Chief Favourite and Minister to his Prince, than they would from him if
ever he should live to wear a Crown: for then (say they) we shall
know how to be provided against him by the Course of the Law.
Nor is it to be doubted but that he who never was known to advise his
Prince, to incommode any one contrary to the Law, will never employ
his own power to the illegal detriment of any man. During this time
that his Prince hath so justly placed so much of the Royal Favour on him,
may he not as to his administration thereof say with the same Justice as the
great Prophet, Whose Ox or Ass have I taken? May it not be asked whom of
the mad sort of Cattle that with an infinity of Calumnies and Shams gored
his reputation, or wild Asses that kick'd at the same, did he hurt with pow|er
or yet take the fair advantage of the Law against, till his many loyal
friends who were secret true Lachrymists, for the publick false misreports
spread against him, did importune him so for the Kingdoms good to de|fend
his honour, and that they might no more be punished by seeing the
limbs of his reputation lie torn and mangled in every Coffee-house, who
had so often exposed those of his Body to Bullets and Chain-shot in Sea
Fights, for the saving the life and honour of their Country?
Those therefore that could in earnest write to the effect abovemention'd
in such seditious Pamphlets, let them talk or look as gravely as they
will, I shall yet think but in jest while at other times they are amusing any
with questions about their being Lachrymists under such a Prince; and
they put me in mind of a famous Musician we had in the Court in King
Iames's time, Dr. Iohn Dowland, who printed a Book of Songs and Pavans
for the Lute with the Title of Lachrymae, and Dedicated it to Queen Anne,
and in the Table of the Book, several of them are thus remarked, viz.
Lachrymae antiquae, Lachrymae gementes, Lachrymae verae, and he observes
there in the Epistle what is obvious enough that Tears are not always shed

in sorrow, but sometimes in joy and gladness. But there is another thing of
more weight that occurs to my thoughts from the remembring that Mr.
Henry Peacham in his Book, called the Compleat Gentleman, doth on the name
of this Lutinest Iohannes Dowlandus, bestow the Anagram, annos ludendo
hausi, and that is, that many in several Parliaments who thought they
could do no right to Protestancy but by doing wrong to the next Heir, did
too much and too long play with the Royal Offers, and when they might
(if they pleased) have effected as quick a prevention of the growth of Po|pery
under any Roman Catholiek Successor, as was took care of in Scot|land.
Yet however I have said enough for my continuing to think that as in
that Kingdom, there are are few or none that fear that the belief of Po|pery
can ever there gain much ground, and ever be the Paramount Reli|gion
there, and who think not that the words of arise Peter kill and eat,
will sooner bring the Scots to eat Hogs Flesh, and believe there is a Divine
Right for their so doing (St. Peters Sheet from Heaven in the Vision ha|ving
had that Animal in it) than to swallow the belief of Popery, or of
the Iure-Divinity of the Pope, so the fears of its growth in England, or of
any occasion for the Virtue of the Lachrymae antiquae of the Primitive
Christians will daily grow more and more moderate, and in time be ex|tinguished.
The late Arch-Bishop of St. Andrews estimated the number of Papists
and their Children in Scotland, to be but about a thousand: but their num|ber
in the States of the Vnited Provinces is vastly more, insomuch that
the ingenious Author of the Policy of the Clergy of France to destroy
the Protestants of that Kingdom, mentions, that there are in Holland, a
Country of small extent, ten times more Popish Ecclesiasticks than there are
Protestant Mnisters in all France, which is very large. There is a compleat
Clergy and Hierarchy. Amsterdam and all the other great Cities have their
Bishops. Those Bishops have their Chapter and their Priests. There are even
religious houses. They are somewhat disguised, but are as well known as the
Ecclesiasticks are in France, and are not in the least assaulted, c. There
was one day in a Long-boat or Ship a Priest dressed in black Cloths who was
not otherwise disguised than that his Coat was short, who said his Breviary
before a hundred persons, with as much Liberty as he could have done in
France.
And yet perhaps the number of those who in Holland fear them, or
who pretend to fear them, is but the least of numbers.
I think too in this sharp sighted age, where Art among the Inquisitive
follows Nature as carefully as Equity doth Law, one may safely predict
that in the Dividend of our time little will come to the share of Metaphy|sicks,
or the considering how Metaphysica agit de iis quae sunt supra natu|ram,
and that the World being infinitely busie will not trouble it self with
Arriags infinitum infinito infinitius: and Christendom's being universally
employed in preparing its defence against War, and giving us time only
for real Learning will divert us from either much opposing or defending
the old point, whether Vniversale be ens reale, or whether Vniversalia are
res extra singularia. If by Metaphysicks we could find a real Answer to the
Question, what is truth, or what is time, of which it hath devoured so
much, or learn how to measure it by knowing what's a Clock, we might
go on with its entitas, which Mr. Hobs well englisheth, the isseness of a
thing; but since it resolves not what things are as aforesaid, but as Hudi|brass
saith, only what is what, I think as Filesac. de authorit. opic. c. 1.
mentions, that the Council in France forbad Aristotle's Metaphysicks, and

punished with Excommunication the exscribing, reading or having that Book,
our time will hold little Communion hereafter with Second Notions on
those who Trade in them, and that as it will seem very absurd to sacrifice
much time to the enquiry if Vniversale is a real being and whether Vni|versalia
are res extra singularia, and to sacrifice men for believing the con|trary,
so it will likewise seem to enquire Whether there be one Catholick,
or Vniversal Apostolick Church existent apart from particular Churches,
which sense and reason tell us are and must be many, tho the Catholick
Church be but one, and for the want of considering which so many People
have been decoyed into the Church of Rome.
Many are the things that an ordinary Philosopher may predict concern|ing
Rome, and particularly varying from the Prophecy, that it was to
be destroyed by Fire, may soretel Romam fore luce delendam, and as Tully's
words are in his Book de Natur Deorum, Opinionem Commenta delebit dies,
veritatis judicia confirmabit. And thus too it is easie to predict that the light
of Reason and Experience will forever blot out here the Innovations that
came from Geneva as well as those from Rome. The Jewish Rabbins have
from the words of the Sol Iustitiae arising with healing in his wings, intro|duced
a Proverb of The Sun ariseth, the infirmity decreaseth, meaning there|by
that the Diseases that make Mortals groan and languish in the
Night, are somewhat abated by the rising Sun: and thus the State of
our Nation will be attended with greater health on the decay of Presbyte|ry's
Kingdom of Darkness.
The Walls of its Iericho are fallen down flat with the sound of the Trum|pets
of the Dissenters own Sayings, so usefully published.
Tho I have said enough to speak my opinion of all Dissenters to the Dis|cipline
of our Church, not owning such sanguinary Principles as are charge|able
on some Papists, yet the Dissenters Sayings have proved enough what
some of their Principles were. Nor can it be forgot that King Iames did
very justly in the Conference at Hampton Court, accuse the Notes in the
Geneva Bible to be Seditious and to savour of Traiterous Conceits, and that
he instanced there in the Notes on Exodus 1. 19. Where they allow of diso|bedience
to Sovereign Kings and Princes.
As absurd as that Tenet beforementioned in the Decrets, and there founded
on the 13th of Deuteronomy is, I would wish no Presbyterian to insult over
any Papists for it: for it is visible in no meaner a Book than the Assemblies
Annotations on Zechary 13. 3. where the Father and Mother of a false
Prophet are commanded to say to him thou shalt not live, and 'tis said, his
Father and Mother that begat him, shall thrust him through when he Prophesi|eth.
The Comment on the words, Thou shalt not live affirms, that the equity
of the Law of Deut. 13. 6. 9. remains under the Gospel: and with less dan|ger
is a Thief, an Adulterer, a Witch tolerated than such an Heretick and Se|ducer.
The present pleading for liberty of Conscience in Preaching and Practice
is a thing extremely shameful, dangerous and destructive: and the Comment
on the the words His Father, c. is, His Parents themselves shall not spare
him, preferring therein their Zeal and Piety towards God before the Affection
and Love which naturally they bear toward their own Children. See Deut.
13. 6. 9. No less Zeal is required under the Gospel than was under the Law.
I pray God deliver all Mankind from the cruel rigour of the Equity
(as those Divines term it) of that Iudicial Mosaic Law binding under the
Gospel: and from that kind of Zeal binding under the Gospel that did un|der
the Law, by virtue of the 6th and 9th Verses of that Chapter, and
from the 16th V. of which Chapter the Obligation for firing Heretical Ci|ties
was as well deduced by the Pope.

The Church of England illuminates us with better Doctrine, and our
Reverend Bishop Sanderson tells us in his 4th Lecture De obligatione conscien|tiae,
that no Law given by Moses doth directly and formally, and per se ind
the Conscience of a Christian, i. e. as it was given by Moses, for that every Mo|saic
Law as such was positive, and did oblige those only it was put upon, i. e.
the Iews, and shews that the Precepts of the Decalogue oblige, not because
Moses commanded them, but because of their being consentaneous to nature,
and confirmed by the Gospel, and so doth manumit the Christian World from
the Yoke of the Iudicial Law that was made only for the stiff necks of
Jews. Calvin himself on that place of Zachary 13. 3. doth blunder as
shamefully as did our Assembly men: for he there makes the Penal Jewish
Laws to bind under the Gospel. His words there are these, Sequitur ergo
non modo legem illam fuisse Iudaeis positam, quemadmodum nugantur fanatici
homines, sed extenditur etiam ad nos eadem lex, and himself was in this
point the Fanatick, and not the contrary opinors: and deniable it is not,
that several of the Calvinistick and Lutheran Divines beyond Sea did im|bibe
the error of hereticidium from the same mistaken Principle of Monk
Gratians, namely, that the Penalsevere Jewish Laws were obligatory un|der
the Gospel: and tho no Presbyterians (that I know of) were here
Arraigned for any design to fire our Metropolis, and some Fanatical Fifth-Mo|narchy
men only were Arraigned, Convicted, and Executed for such a de|sign
(and whose Names I think might on that account have been proper|ly
enough engraven on the City Monument) yet of the out-age of
our Presbyterians having actually fired the Church and State with an in|testine
War, the whole Kingdom is a Monument: and where now their
Principles are so seen, and seen through, that I believe any other such in|humane
Ecclesiasticks as many of our former Presbyterians were, will be asha|med
to appear among us. Their Assembly is adjourned to the Grave, and
no Divines will (I believe) in any future Course of time find the People
of England willing to have 4s. a day, the wages of each in the Parliaments
Synod, allowed to them for endeavouring to bring our Consciences under
the Mosaic Pedagogy: and the noise of the World from Hammers of He|reticks
either in any Presbyterian Synod in England, or in any new Popish
General Council beyond Sea, will (I believe) be utterly over.
And tho perhaps the Centum gravamina did heretofore cause the last pre|tended
General Council to be called, I mean the Famous Tridentine one, I
may, looking on the Course of Nature, conclude, that there will never be
any General Council more; and that not only for that the Pope hath been
hors de page, since the breaking up that of Trent, but because that having
been Revera a Council of Pensioners, and having stood the Papacy for Pen|sions
in 3000 Crowns a Month, (i. e. in 750 l. Sterling) and having put
the Popes to that Charge during its sitting for 18 years, as it is easie to
Calculate how much in pounds Sterling that Council cost the Popes in all,
so it is as easie to foresee that if the Pope should have occasion for the fel|low
to that Council, he would not have that quantity of Money to spare
for the same.
There is another thing that I may from the Course of Nature fortel
much quiet to my Prince, and happiness to my Country by, and that is
the extermination of all Mercenary Loyalty, and of an inglorious Loyalty-Trade
as well as of a Religion-Trade, and mens not thinking they are to
have Offices or Donatives for not being Villains, or that by Mono|polizing
to themselves the name of the Loyal, they should expect
therefore a lucrative Monopoly, the which would stain their Loyalty
indeed, and make it as null and void as any Monopoly: for the word

Loyal being used for Lawful, he is not homo legalis in one sense, who is
bought to be just.
The apparent vast number of the Kings Subjects rendring them too ma|ny
to hope all for largesses, and the too great probability of the Future
State of England according to my Notion, requiring for the support and
defence of the Government, all that to be employed in order thereunto,
what giving Parliaments can well give, will make People ashamed to
cling to the Royal-Oak like Ivy, and by preying on its vigour make it
the less able to give shelter by its branches.
I was overjoyed with a piece of News a Gentleman sent me, namely
that he discoursing once at dinner with the Lord Hide, the first Commissioner
of the Treasury, concerning the Insolence of some mens expecting to be
rewarded by the King, for not doing mischief to his Government or Re|venue,
his Lordship occasionally mentioned somewhat to this effect, viz.
that the Trade of ch men was now broke: there will now be no more
taking off of men as the word was: and if by his Lordship's Advice to his
Great Master, the resolving against taking off of men by Pensions and Re|wards,
was settled as a new Fundamental Rule in the English Politicks, as I
am informed it was, I shall think his Lordship deserves to find an everlasting
Triumph in the History of the Age, and to be more honoured by England
than if as Commander of an Army he had vanquished very many Thou|sands
of its Enemies: for that the taking off of Hydra's Heads by Gifts
(as was beforementioned) would be an endless work, and the ill
effects thereof inclusive of so much Hostility to the publick, would
be innumerable. But God be thanked the King by the Political
Conduct of this his Minister is now made Victorious over all those
Enemies: and if I had heard that any near his Majesty had mo|ved
for a day of Thanksgiving by reason hereof, I should not have
wondered at it; the thing being of so great importance to England. And
no doubt but the shame of any mens diminishing the Royal Reve|nue
by begging from the Crown will be the greater, when the ne|cessary
improvement of our Land by our numerous People shall have
enriched as many as deserve to be so, and when to all, who are industrious,
there will every where be multiplex praeda in medio posita, and the effects
of diligence fill all hands with profit, and eyes with pleasure.
This is one kind of a New Heaven and a New Earth, that perhaps we
may shortly see in old England, and when men shall by enquiries about
Religion design only lucriferous experiments, and not luciferous as my Lord
Bacon's Phrase is; and men shall improve their fortunes by the improve|ment
and culture of the Earth: and to this effect we find the Prophecies
of Prosperity to the Iews in the old Testament expressed by the Trees
yielding their fruit, and the Earth their encrease, the Seed shall be prospe|rous,
the Vine shall give her Fruit and the Ground shall give her encrease,
the Earth shall hear the Corn and the Wine and the Oyl, c.
And they who are now by seducers that augment wild fears and jealou|sies
directed to look up for strange Prodigies to the Sky, will need no Moni|tors
to behold with joy the unusual fruitfulness of the cultivated Earth: and
therefore I think that one Philosopher looking on the Future State of Eng|land
may well say to another,
Aspice venturo laetentur ut omnia saeclo.
Then shall men on the account of Profit turn their Swords to Plough|shares,
and the Religion-Trading false Prophet baffled by fate, shall then say
as 'tis in Zachary, Non sunt Propheta, agricola sum.

I do not wonder at some mens menacing our English World with ill news
from Fate. It is no irrational thing to suppose that the false Prophets in all
ages did often find it turn to their private account to foretel evil rather than
good to Kingdoms; for that many might hope to mend their fortunes by
the publick ruines, and would therefore be well pleased with the Predi|ctors
of ill to the publick, and would celebrate the Predicters; and therefore
it was not without cunning contrived that the prolation of Events by the
ancient Oracles, should be in a double sense sometimes, because it might
then be a moot point whether the Party of those that desired the quiet or
disorder of great Bodies of People was most considerable.
The most sagacious sort of false Prophets whose chief business it was to
be true to themselves (as the falsest Dice of Gamesters are most true to
the users) did often choose to alarm the People with disastrous Events:
and thus the Witch of Endor chose to make the Shamm-Samuel entertain
Saul with the prediction of his and his Sons death the next day. But 'tis
time for us to follow that great admonition of Beware of false Prophets,
when we hear so many foretelling us, as by inspiration, of nothing but la|mentation
and weeping and great mourning in England, for the continuance
of the decay of Trade, and unavoidable ruine of the Protestant Religion,
and when many such deluders and counterfeit Lachrymists cannot (I
fancy) about our weeping on this account, take their measures together
without smiling, according to that Say of Tully, Potest augur augurem videre
 non ridere? It is a very great saying of Tully's in his 2d Book de Divina|tione,
Nam ut vere loquamur, superstitio fusa per orbem oppressit omnium fere
animos, atque hominum occupavit imbecillitatem. And as wise as Socrates
was, yet in Xenophon he disputes that, , and Oracles were necessary
to the preservation of Common-wealths, and Plutarch doth alledge experi|ence
in Confirmation thereof; and the murmuring Iews thought themselves
ill used by Providence when the age wanted a Prophet among them, tho yet
the Prophets were so frequent in denunciations of wo to them, and like Sea|men
they liked weather that was somewhat like a storm, rather than to lie
in the World becalm'd. 'Tis said in Psalm 74. There is no more any Prophet,
we see not our signs.
And as much as Superstition had in Tully's words, dasterded almost all mens
spirits, yet the Cheat of the Augury was so contrived and diversified as some|times
on occasion to heighten and enlarge them, and in effect to enlarge the
Empire it self.
Augusto augurio postquam inclyta condita Roma est.
But many of our Augurs endeavour only to enlarge our fears and jea|lousies,
and to intimidate our spirits and to render the Genius of the Na|tion
less august, and only to enlarge their own fortunes.
But the ill ominous Birds are flying away: and the many Loyal Addresses
with which the Land re-echoes, and the avowed readiness of so many
good men to serve the best of Princes with their Lives as well as Fortunes
upon occasion, import the best of Auguries to England, and such an one
as Homer mentions,
.
i. e. Vnum augurium est praestantissimum, pugnare pro patri: and to which
Verse of Homer, Tully probably intended a reference when in his de senectu|te
he said, Optimis auguriis ea geri, quae pro Reip. Salute gerentur.

Your Lordship hath formerly among the great transactions of your life
shewn your self a noble Adventurer, for the honour and danger that this
kind of Augury can import, and particularly by your carrying at once
your Law in your head, and your life in your hand in the sight of a Party
that had been so successful with their Swords and even to wind-ward of all
others by inspiration, and when the Conduct of your Politicks so highly ad|vanced
your Prince's Restoration, and so much helped to effect the quash|ing
of all the furious Prophecies of Monarchy ceasing in England.
Not without apologizing for my guilt of a solecism like his who dis|coursed
of War before Hanibal, by my having so largely addressed my Sen|timents
of the Future State of England to such an Oracle as your Lordship,
I must at last say,
Non ego sum Vates, sed prisci conscius aevi, c.
and have only taken my measures from natural Causes, and judging of
things to come by what have been, and by nature's most firm Constancy to
it self, and things not being ill administrable; and at this rate can further
very safely predict that according to Iuvenal,
Nunquam aliud natura, aliud sapientia dicet.
And moreover I have in my predictions of the Future State of Eng|land
interspersed many Remarks that may be directive, and naturally tend
to enrich the Land and advance its Trade and Industry; and thus I do
account that our Writers of Almanacks do some way compensate the loss of
Peoples time employed in regarding how they turn the hand of the Lot|tery
of Fate round the World, and foretel various Revolutions and Events
here at home and abroad, by their likewise telling them in what Months
to set Quick-sets and Fruit and Timber-Trees, dig Gardens, fell Timber,
uncover the Roots of Trees, and to trim all sorts of Fruit-trees from
Moss, Canker, and superfluous Branches, when to transplant Trees and
when to remove Grafts or young Trees, and when to sow all manner of
Garden Seeds and Herbs, when to sow Wheat, and to sow Hemp and
Flax, and by raising in them rational expectations of the Future State of
the Earth meliorated by its Culture.
My Lord, according to the common connexion of thoughts, it here
comes in my way to think that it is usual in the Scripture and in several
Books, to express the sense of placing Notions and Tenets and Doctrines in the
World, by the Terms of Seeds and Plants, and the spreading of the same
by the growth encrease and propagation of Plants, and the ceasing of
them by the Terms of decrease, withering or extirpation. Our Saviour's
Parables of the Sower, and some Seeds falling by the way side and being de|voured
by the Fowls, and some falling upon stony places where they had not
much Earth, and forthwith springing up because they had no deepness of Earth,
and being scorched when the Sun was up, and because they had not root wither|ing
away, and his Indication of false Prophets by the similitude of Trees,
and knowing them by their Fruit, and his reference to false Doctrines, when
he saith, That every Plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted shall be
rooted up, and his expression of false Religionary Notions by Tares in the
Parable, are known to all conversant with their English Bibles, as is like|wise
his resembling himself to the Vine, and his Father to the Husband|man,
and his saying, that every Branch in me that beareth not Fruit he ta|keth
away, and St. Paul's calling the Church God's Husbandry, and when

he tells the Corinthians of his Planting and Apollos his water|ing.
And we have heard enough of a Collegium de propagand fide, among
the Romanists, and their many laboured points De extirpandis haereticis,
and of the Exterminium Haereticorum: and of their Arts to exirpate what|soever
Religionary Notions they are pleased to call Heretical, and of Na|ture
in this Realm having extirpated those Arts: and we know how natu|rally
Protestancy did shoot up again in this our Soyle under Queen Eliza|beth's
Reign, after its being cut down near the Ground in Queen Mary's:
Quippe solo natura subest: and accordingly Iob regarding the Nature of the
Soyle saith, There is hope of a Tree if it be cut down that it will sprout
again, and that the tender Branch thereof will not cease, tho the Root thereof
wax old in the Earth, and the Stock thereof die in the Ground, yet through
the Scent of Water it will bud and bring forth Boughs like a Plant: and the
hand of the God of Nature kept her hands from extirpating it: and the
irrigation of Nature wrought more powerfully than her Fies, and the
Scent of Water made Sagacious, Loyal Protestants with their Lachrymae
verae and lachrymae antiquae presage the growth of Protestancy: but as our
Laws now are and likely forever to be, Protestants here may not only take
their measures of the natural duration of their Religion, from the simili|tude
of the sublime Prophet, viz. as the days of a Tree are the days of my
People, but from the stability of the Lex terrae and the very Earth.
I have before spoke of the Papal Power ending in England under Harry
the 8th, per simplicem desinentiam, and by the power of Nature: and with|out
the Midwifery of the trouble of his Conscience, or any Artifice in trou|bling
the Divines and Academies of Christendom about his Marriage with
his Brothers Relict, the birth of Fate would by necessity of Nature have
(I think) happen'd as it did. Alas! His Marrying her, who had been his
Brothers Wife, was only against the Iudicial Law of the Iews, and I am
sure was not against the Law of Nature, as all granting the Law of Na|ture
to be indispensable, and the necessity of Cain and Abel Marrying
their own Sisters, and Gods Commanding them to increase and multiply,
and God's calling Sara Abraham's Wife, who yet was his Sister, (when as
that Matrimonial Contract if it had been against Nature had been null)
and granting likewise that God, who never commanded any thing against
the Law of Nature, did yet in the Levitical Law Command a Brother to
take his Brothers Wife to Marry her, and to raise up Seed to his Brother,
must grant: I therefore concluded, that without Harry the 8ths either
having any Conscience or any Trouble in it, the weakest pretence in the
strong hand of Nature would have been an effectual Weapon, to have
then beat down the Papal Power in England, It was Nature that did, as I
may say, raise up that strong Seed at that time both in England and Germa|ny
and elsewhere, that ended in the Divorce of England and many Terri|tories
from the Papal Power.
And to resume the Comparison of the Seed of Plants, 'tis obvious to
us to consider that while our Ships Royal were formerly made of the Oaks
in our Forests that were generally self-sown, that is, such as sprang from
Acorns dropping from Trees, or that Birds in their flights let fall, it may
be said that those materials for rearing the Walls of the Kingdom, were
themselves reared by the hand of Nature, and that those Seeds falling in
a Soyle proper for them, and by the Forest Laws guarded at first from the
fet of Men or Beasts, and by the Autumnal Rains naturally beaten into
the Earth, and defended by the procerity of many other Trees from the
injuries of the Wind and Sun, were by the Husbandry of the God of Na|ture

brought within the high Style of Arbores Dei, as the Psalmist's ex|pression
is. And moreover while it many times happens, that we see one
Timber Tree grow out of the Body of another, and particularly an
Oak out of a Beech (and which may be well supposed to have so happened
from an Acorn dropt by a Bird into the hollow part of a decaying Beech)
and there meeting with a reception from the putrid parts of the Beech,
and the Rain there furthering its passage downward; and the Dews there
watering it from Heaven, and the Beech fencing it conveniently from the
Wind and Sun, the Stem of an Oak doth there naturally shoot up, and
as naturally pierce its way for its strong Branches through the sides of the
Beech, and work its Root into the ground through the Root of that Tree,
and in time causeth it as certainly to be thrust out of Nature as it could
have been by any extirpation; and when a decaying Oak is thus powerful|ly
vanquished by the Seed of a less famous Tree, (as to this purpose we
are told by Mr. Evelyn in his excellent Discourse of Forest Trees, that
persons of undoubted truth have asserted it, that they have seen a Tree cut in
the middle whose heart was Ash-wood and the exterior part Oak) we may
justly say that Nature did produce all these effects. And the Energy of nature
thus casually causing one Tree to penetrate through another into the Earth,
and there without noise forever to displace it, is as perfectly applicable to Re|ligionary
Tenets and Doctrines: and thus (as I may with a running view
observe) the Seed of the Christian Religion, being (tho from some mean
and obscure hands) dropt on the decaying great Trees of Iudaism and Pa|ganism,
presently wrought it self through their Bodies and Roots; and
afterward the nobleness of the temper of the Primitive Christianity de|caying
in the World, that Religion, whose heart of Oak had lasted so long,
and outbraved all the Storms of Persecution, was yet pierced through by
Arrianism: and Arrius perplexing the simplicity of the Christian Religion
with such Intrigues of vain Philosophy, that instead of converting mens
hearts turned their brains, and even Constantine's own (as appeared by his
banishing Athanasius, and then recalling, and then banishing him again) and
when the Christian Divines vexed every vein of his heart more than they
did Iulian's, and very laudably in his Council of Nice presented him with
Lampoons one against another, and Christianity so soon proving top
heavy when 'twas made the State Religion of the World, and Athanasius
himself was at length the only sober Party, and when the Arrians happen|ed
to be the first Christians that persecuted men for Religionary Tenets,
(and as Grotius in his De Iure belli, l. 2. c. 20. tells us, In Arrianam hae|rsin
acriter invehitur Athanasius, quod prima in contradicentes usa esset Iudi|cum
potstate,  quos non potuit verbis inducere, eos vi, plagis, verberibus
ad se pertrahere anniteretur, and did bastinado People into Conversion) and
when the Orthodox Christians had groaned longer under the Arrian Per|secution,
than they had done under the Pagan, and when the Christian
Religion whose Precepts do so nobly transcend the Morality of all
others, did shortly after appear in the World with such a Figure of a Do|tard
Tree as gave Salvian cause to exclaim, Praeter paucissimos quosdam,
qui mala fugiunt quid est aliud omnis coetus Christianorum quam sentina vitio|rum,
it was but congruous to ature that those rapacious Birds of prey the
Mahumetans, dropping the Seed of their new invented Religion on the
Christian as decayed by Arrianism, that it should so soon work it self
through all its parts and roots in Asia and Africk, and that the Crescent there
should so powerfully dive away the Cross. And thus too, when Italy
was over-run with the barbarous Nations partly of the Pagan, and parly
of the Arrian Belief, Pagnism and Arrianism being then Dotard

Trees in the World, the Seed of the Christian Doctrine falling on them
from the Pious and Learned hands of Gregory the Great, did easily work
through them, and for the Conversion of them, and likewise of our English
Nation, about the Year 600 from Heathenish Idolatry, the greatest Cele|brations
are due to him: and no wonder if the Papacy then yielding so
good Fruit, did then cast so venerable a shade in the World. But that
Tree afterward being observed to degenerate and decay, within Six
Years (as the general Observation of our Apocalyptick Men is, (Valeat
quantum valere possit) and who thus tells us of the aetates Antichristi, viz.
Nascentis in Bonifacio circa Ann. 606; Iuveniliter exultantis in 2. Consilio
Nicaeno, Anno. 787. Regnantis in Hildebrando  successoribus post An. 1075.
Triumphantis in Leone Decimo, Ann. 1517. Vltima senescentis est: and say,
that shortly after it began to be consumptive,) and the decays of it being
obvious to the view of the gazing World, and the Branches of the Luthe|ran
and Calvinistick Tenets appearing through its sides, the quiet and gen|tle
Order of Capuchins was invented for the praying for its growth and
flourishing in the Year 1530. and ten years afterward the Active Fiery Or|der
of the Iesuites was invented to extirpate the Men that wished ill to its
growth, and after that the Fathers of the Oratory were set up to extoll
and preach up the Tree, but Nature would not be extirpated: the Potent
Seminal Virtue of the Rational Religion dropt on the Tree of the other,
hath passed its roots through and through, and (as I may say) tran|substantiated
it self through them, and rooted it self deep both into the in|tellectual
World, and into States and Kingdoms and their Laws, and will
in time probably leave not one Fibre or Capillamentum of the Roots of the
Irreligionary part of the Tenets of Popery remaining in Nature: and shew
the World that the Schisma Anglicanum that Sanders and other Papists cry
out of as so unnatural, was a mere natural Scissure or Rupture of the parts of
the decaying Tree of the Church of Rome, that came to pass from the Seed
of the Protestant Religion being cast thereon.
And such a Natural Scissure hath the Religion of the Church of England
made through the sides and roots of Protestant Recusancy: and the
Seeds that by the hands of Non-conformists, probably guided by Iesuites,
have been laid on the Royal-Oak of the Church of England, which they
vainly thought decay'd, were in effect thrown away: and as the old Prophetic
Fiction represents it, that every great Tree included a certain Tutelar Genius
and still living with it, it may be said that Nature it self is the Tutelar Ge|nius
of that Plant of Renown, that (according to the Scripture expressi|on)
we may call the Church of England, and will ever live with
it.
The Numbers of our Non-conformists are daily decaying, and the names
of their Tenets will probably be in a short time forgotten.
We are told in Townsend's Collections that Sir Walter Raleigh mention'd
it in one of the Parliaments of Queen Elizabeth, viz. in Anno 1593. That
there were then near 20000 Brownists in England: a number somewhat
near as great as that of the Papists to be estimated from the Bishops Sur|vey.
The name of those Schismaticks is evaporated, and their Tenets are
not more known or enquired into by the Populace, then are the Heresies
of the Bardesanistae, the Aquei, the Abelonitae, the Messaliani, and some
others.
As was remarked concerning the late Non-Conforming Divines not ha|ving
bred up their Sons to Non-Conformity; the same thing is much ob|servable
among the Lay-Dissenters, and that their Children do not gene|rally
imbibe their Parents principle of Dissentership; but rather the con|trary.

The Gross of their Numbers always consisting chiefly of Artisas
and Retail-Traders in Corporations, (where before the King's Restora|tion
they were numerous) and naturally hating Popery and its Parade of
Ceremonies, cannot but be sensible of the sharp hatred against the same in
the Professors of the Religion of the Church of England, as by Law Esta|blished;
and how vastly such Professors do every where over-shoot the
Dissenters in numbers: and how the Seed of the Church of England hath
as naturally and with as much ease pierced through the Body of theirs
and dissolved its Roots as doth the Seed of an Oak often growing in the
Body of a decayed Willow.
The times were known in the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth, King Iames,
and King Charles the first, and likewise since, (till within these late years)
that some States-men when their Court-Interest was decaying and in dan|ger
of Extirpation, could, by wheadling Dissenters into a belief that they
would plant their perswasion in the Church, plant themselves the better
in the State: but (humanly speaking) such Conjunctures of time will
come here no more: and the seeming Eradication of such a Religion-Trade
in Church and State, is a strong Indication, That our Heavenly Father or
(as I may say) the God of Nature never planted it.
But if there were no Laws in being to extirpate any Dissenters Schism,
or separation from our Church, or to Mulct or Excommunicate the obsti|nate
Separaters, or if any of those Laws were never Executed (as through
the vigilance of our Magistrates they have been) yet is there one apparent
way whereby the Conformists to the Church of England could now as
easily lessen their numbers, and consequently extirpate their Potency every
where, as they can frame a thought or resolution to do it, and by no o|ther
Engine than that with which our Universities of Oxford and Cam|bridge
batter the Contumacy of particular Towns-men, namely, not by Ex|communicating,
but by discommuning them, that is to say, by forbidding
the Scholars to Trade with them.
Their own forbearance of buying from Conformists the Wares that
those of their own Sect do sell, may reasonably invite such a realiation.
While heretofore they were so numerous in England, their Congregated
Churches helped many of the mean Artists and poor Traders thereof,
with the pretence of Liberty of Conscience to force a Trade by Combina|tion
among themselves: and their doing it then turn'd to some account;
but would now be altogether insignificant in this wane of their Num|bers.
And thus without sweat or blood, or one Information brought on Penal
Statutes, or the least occasion or colour for their Out-cry of Persecution,
may the many Millions of Conformists here humble the Comparative
handful of Popish and Protestant Recusants both in Corporations, and out
of them too when they please, and in effect reduce them to the Condition
the many Empericks in our Land would be in, if they only sold Physick to
one another.
I affect not to be a Propounder of any new Law, or of the execution
of any old that may give the least Addition of trouble to any Member of
the Realm, whose Principles and Practices are not justly suspected to threa|ten
the disturbance of the whole: and my being informed by some of my
Correspondents, who are very impartial observers of things, that many of
the Dissenters of this Age have made the Press send forth several of the An|timoniarchical
Principles of the former, and as if they designed to revive its
Rebellion, and that tho the same Laws that have secured our Religion, have
likewise secured the Power of the Militia solely to the King, and Enacted,

that it is not lawful on any pretence to take up Arms, c. yet that the Go|vernment
is justly apprehensive of many Dissenters and their Pastors, own|ing
the former Doctrine of Resistance, I could wish (as I did in behalf of
the Papists) that they would themselves offer to his Majesty's Considera|tion
such a way of a Test or Assurance of their being become sound parts of
the State, and that they aim at no power of disturbing it; and as to his
Royal Wisdom may appear substantial and satisfactory till they do so I wish
that not only the Magistracy but all private loyal persons would have such
a regardful eye on them as is had in Foreign parts on those that come for
Prattiques from infected places, and bring no Letters of Health, and that
they would have Prattique or Commerce with such of them: which would
soon enforce them to live by themselves.
I have in this Discourse already acknowledged it to your Lordships just
praise, that you are not of too narrow a Spirit or Principles as to Protestant
Dissenters, as supposing that you had such Sentiments of the usage fit to
be afforded to some of them, that our Learned Bishop of Winchester own'd
in a Letter to your Lordship, which you once shewed me: and I was as
ready to be their Excusator as any of the Church of England could be till
I saw their ingratitude so instrumental in Cancelling the Declaration of In|dulgence:
and still out of a natural inclination do, as I said in the Case of
the Papists, wish them all that share of the Royal Favour that would not
undo themselves and others: and (as I said in the Case of the Papists) do sup|pose
the continuance of the old Laws against Protestant Recusants necessa|ry
in this Conjuncture, that the King in whom the Executive Power of
the Laws is lodged, may sharpen the edge against any one of the Party
that should be an aggressor against the Peace of the Kingdom, and espe|cially
considering how often many of the Puritans have took the advan|tage
of the publick pressures of the Crown in former Ages, and that
while it was in procinctu to withstand a Foreign Invasion. My Lord
Keeper Puckering's Observation of their Temper expressed in his memora|ble
Speech is known to all: and the present apprehensions in the Govern|ment
of danger from Dissenters, have sufficiently evinced the Prudence of
his Majesty's Measures in not repealing the Penal Clauses in our Statutes
against Protestant Recusants. When they who were regarded as weak Bre|thren,
do now fortiter Calumniari and Libel the Government, and call whom
they will Iulian, 'tis necessary that the Prince by having the power of
the Penal Laws in his hand, should be able to discriminate those who have
not yet discriminated themselves: and in the Case of Persons stupid
and perverse, 'tis fitter that Children should be Lachrymists than old
men.
When the Divines of the Church of England have of late from one end
of the Land to the other alarmed the People with Exhortations against
Disloyalty, as loud as those in a late Conjuncture against Popery, and the
King's Ministers were informed of the Altum silentium, in the Conventicles
as to any making the English Bibles there support the Rights of our
English Kings, and that the Iulians there were Apostates from the Princi|ples
of the Non-Conformists in King Iames's time, and had forgot how
Reynolds, Whitaker, Cartwright, Dod, Traverse, c. had in their Wri|tings
disowned the assigning it as a Cause of the Primitive Obedience,
Quia deerant vire, and that a new Sect of false weak Brethren had learned
to urge the deerant vires, 'twas time for the King to keep the strength of
the old Laws in his hands, and occasionally to arm them against the
petulant insolence of any Seditious Protestant or Popish Recusants.

I have been far from recommending in this Discourse the Exterminium
haereticorum, or Extirpation of any Recusants: but have endeavoured
with the sedateness requisite in a Philosophical or Political Disquisition, to
give my Judgment of the Natural Causes that induce me to expect the
Extermination only of things, or Principles Relionary, and indeed to
speak more properly, of that part of Mens Principles only that is irreligio|nary
and against Nature, and to expect such parts being luce delenda.
I expect not that all the Debates of the Religionary part of Presbytery
should here among all men cease, tho yet I have conjectured that they
who should write professedly of that Subject here would want Readers, and
as I believe too Discoursers of the Latitudinarian Hypothesis would likewise:
and do think that many little Religionary Speculative Notions about the
meaning of some obscure passages in Scripture may to some of our Dissen|ters
seem great, and employ their time in Debates, and as when the famous
Ainsworth and Broughton heretofore had before their Congregations of
Dissenters who went hence to Holland many and fierce disputes about the
Controvesie, whether Aarons ephod were blew or Sea-green, a Controversie
that puzzled all the Dyers of Amsterdam, (as Fuller says of it in his
Church History) as well as it did our separatists there, that took so much
pains to be therein illuminated, and which I think the light of a Farthing
Candle brought in any night among them, might have easily settled (or as
I may say deleted) in regard that blew and yellow making a green, the
yellow of the flame of the Candle would have made what appeared blew
by day, to have seem'd green at night, and prevented their further Ana|thematising
one another as Schismaticks about the same.
And as I beforementioned it out of a late Book of a Divine of the Church
of England, that some of the Reliogionary parts of Popery he instanceth
in, viz. Invocation of Saints, Transubstantiation, Purgatory, are and will be
learnedly and voluminously defended to the Worlds end, I believe the same
may be so in Popish Countries abroad, and that the same will be believed
by many Persons here, tho yet the voluminous discussion of the same
hath long been (and is like to be) out of fashion here, and reflections on
the same en passant, or only in short Treatises may be thought by our Di|vines
sufficient to guide their Auditors from mistakes therein, and effectu|ally
to confute: and I believe that our English Church will never be trou|bled
with the growth of the Doctrine of Transubstantiation under any
Prince, we may have who shall believe it, nor of the Doctrine of Consub|stantiation
under any Prince of the Lutheran perswasion, nor of Calvin's
horrendum decretum relating to reprobation (as 'tis call'd) under any
Prince that may believe the Doctrine of Calvin, tho yet till the Peace of
Munster the timid People of the Lutheran and Calvinian Religions hating
one another more than they did Papists abroad in the World, were so
much imposed on by fears and jealousies in Case a Lutheran or Calvinian
Prince should by the right of Lineal Descent come to rule them.
But the Munster Peace has taught them better things: and should I ever
hear that any Roman Catholick Prince here did according to the power
by Law reposed in him, relax some of the Penalties of the Law in Case
of Recusancy, that as things now are, Recusancy would not be thereby
rendered considerably prolific with Converts.
Tho I have given my opinion as beforementioned concerning the Fact
of the encrease of the number of the Papists in the Conjuncture of the
Declaration of Indulgence, and do not think fit to alter it, yet I can tell
your Lordship that a Person of great Sagacity who I believe considered
the State of their Numbers here then very carefully, and entirely believe

what he published thereof in Print, I mean the Author of the Catholick
Apology with a reply, c. there saith, that during the Year 1672.
(and which he calls a year of Peace) there was not one Priest, one Mass
one Conversion more in England, than in the Year 1663, 1666. or any other
time of trouble.
I have in this Discourse spoke of such a perfect hatred against Po|pery
as may always consist with a perfect love to Papists, and cinge not
a hair of their heads more than a Lambent fire. I have acknowledged
the great mortifications austerities and zealous devotions, not only among
many of the Religious Orders of the Church of Rome, but of the common
People, and have allowed a sober Party to the Iesuites themselves, and
have reason to believe that Bellarmine himself, that hammer of Heretical
Princes, as his Works shew him, was yet of so soft and gentle a disposition
as would not permit him to hurt a Fly or tread on a Worm: and I have
reflected on no other Principles of the Iesuites, with any sharpness than
what the present Pope hath done, and which the Court of Inquisition at Rome
or elsewhere would have allowed me to do: and I have been as I still am
so free from any thing of rancour or acerbity in my Principles, relating to
the usage of the Papists that an English Priest of the Church of Rome,
the Author of the remarkable Book beforementioned, called the Advocate
of Conscience Liberty, or an Apology for toleration rightly stated, publish|ed
in the Year 1673. (and the most considerable Book that had for se|veral
years been writ in favour of the Roman Catholicks, and a Book our
Learned Dr. Stilling fleet refers to in a very excellent printed Sermon of
his p. 43. and called, The Reformation justified, and Preached before the
Lord Mayor of London) doth me the honour there to adopt as his own se|veral
Sayings of mine, he found in a printed Discourse of mine that was dis|swasive
of the use of force in matters of Religion, and gave me occasion
when I read some passages in his 14th, 25th, 26th, 34th, 43d, 54th, 55th,
62d, 94th Pages there, to call to mind that I had read them elsewhere: and
much good might any thing in my Writings do that Author, and he
was as welcome to them as if they had been his own: and I am sorry that
his not citing an Author where he should have done it, was accompanied
with another misfortune of citing one where he should not, I mean his in
p. 225. citing of D' Ossat. He might have cited another passage of mine
against Hereticide as being impolitic if he had pleased to have took notice
of it among its fellows, and where I observed, that the putting of the Ro|man
Catholick Priests here to death, did propagate their Religion: and that
that Faith was given to the Assertors of Popish Opinions, because they were
dying, which they could not have drawn from me but by raising the dead.
I still own what in p. 93. he partly cites of mine as said by another Author,
That if it be not lawful for every man to be guided by his private Iudgment in
things of Religion, 'twill be hardly possible to acquit our separation from the
Romish Church from the guilt of Schism, c. and if any Papist shall as to
any Tenet that can properly come within the denomination of Religion tell
me, that his private Judgment guides him to receive the guidance of the
Church of Rome, and that therefore I a Protestant ought not to be in|clined
to bear hard upon him on the account of such adhesion to his pri|vate
Judgment, I shall own the Argumentum ad hominem so far as to tell
him that I am not inclined eo nomine to he severe to him.
And now my Lord, because it hath been so ustmary in the Authors of
large Discourses to bestow on them a short REVIEW, that it would ap|pear
sulleness in me not to follow them, and because it would be an irre|verence
to your great Judgment in me to present any thing for you to view

once, that I had not resolv'd to view twice, I intend to improve some
Intervals of leisure hereafter in reviewing of this Discourse, and shall explain
some passages therein on occasion and add others: and if I doubt of any
thing particularly in the various matters of Calculation herein contained
(and of many of which few or none perhaps have written) or shall
alter my opinion therein, or in any thing else, I shall acquaint your Lord|ship
why I do so; and do as much value my self on my natural temper
of acknowledging a quick and ready assent to any proposition of Reason
that convinceth my understanding (how contradictory soever the same
may be to any former Notion of mine) as any man can value himself
on his thinking he never erred, or on his Abilities either by Eloquence
or Sophisms to make others think so, and to make them erre with him:
and do still account this to be one of the best properties in the best Ship,
namely, the soonest to feel its Rudder: and do think, that as none but
Cowards are cruel, so none but Dunces are positive.
My Lord, after the Efflux of the various Intervals in which this Dis|course
was written, it having happened that the Papists are to the gene|ral
satisfaction of impartial Judges of Men and Things, become as found a
part of this Nation as they were and are of the Dutch States, (and as
throughout this Discourse I always supposed them capable of being) and
that the Body of them is as Loyal as can be wished, and likely forever so
to continue, and that none but the Factious would have them now to
groan under the Penal Laws as formerly, I will not despair of many of our
Dissenters improving hereafter in Principles of Loyalty, as likewise of
Conformity, but hope they will really deserve to be thought as Loyal as
they were so de facto, by many greater Judges than my self at the time
of the beginning of this Discourse, and when so many in our Loyal Par|liaments
were so extravagant in their Charity to Dissenters, as to think
that St. Peters Ship was the only Fire-Ship, and Non-Conformity a quiet
trading Merchant-man, and being hared with fears and jealousies of Popery,
were so eager to have the very Laws against Protestant Recusants Re|pealed.
But as I hinted the distinguishing between Popish and Protestant Mathe|matcks
to be absurd, and as a gross Error about Proportion or Numbers
would appear more ridiculous in Archimedes than in an ordinary Mathe|matician;
so true Protestants Non-sense or true Protestants Rebellion is to
be no favourable Case: and the Name of Protestants must not more than
that of the Society of Iesus be allowed as a Charm to raise the Devil of
Rebellion.
When Luther and those who of old deserved the Name of True Prote|stants
abroad as great Co-workers with Nature, in introducing the Refor|mation
of Religion, were almost deafen'd by their Papal Adversaries Out|cryes
of the tunica inconsutulis, and when particularly as Sleidan tells us in
his Commentarys, Granvill the Emperors Deputy in an harangue he made to
the Citizens of Wormes did so passionately conjure them, That they would not
tear Christ's seamless Coat, the Protestant Populace was so far from being
aw'd out of their way by those words, as that they gave their Adversa|ries
the Name of Inconsutulistae, or the seamless men: and as little will
any of our false and jesuited Rebellious Dissenters effect any thing but the
abuse of the name and thing of Protestancy, and the ridiculing themselves
by their usurping on a pretence to be TRVE PROTESTANTS.
It comes here in my way to observe that some of our Dissenters and
other Nominal Protestants, who are so apt without sense or reason to call
others Enemies to the King and Kingdom, have really appeared such to

both, by their having so much encreased Divisions in our State as well as
Church, and by their having been the Aggressors in the dividing the Po|pulace
here by spightful calling of Names, which yet I have not thought
fit to mention in this Discourse, and whereby the Loyal have been forced
some way to retaliate, not only out of a generous scorn, but that they
might speak intelligibly: such Aggressors have likewise notoriously con|tributed
to the Divisions in the Kingdom by their too much encouraging
the Plot-Witnesses (and particularly that Recorded Profligate who so de|sperately
perjured himself in the Case of your Lordship, and the Earl of
Peterborough and a High-born Prince) and by extreme acerbity and ran|cour
relating to the Persons of Papists. But their most fatal injury to
their Country hath been their weakning its Reputation (a thing which
Kingdoms must necessarily subsist by, as well as private Persons) through
their studied Artifice of making a Popish Plot to be thought so long li|fed,
and when England's reputation for its strength, or which is all one
for its being united within it self, was much more necessary for its well
being, than in any Conjuncture of time that perhaps ever happen'd.
Considering therefore that the present State of England doth, and
that the probable Future State of it will call so peremptorily on all his
Majesty's Subjects to preserve their Country by the Exterminium of all
Divisions, as I think I have not brought any disreputation to my own
Judgment by adventuring to predict the necessary growth of Lyalty ma|king
all England to become in time one Sober Party; so I am sure I have
provided for the Reputation of my Country thereby as well as I could.
I am not so angry as to think that many of our Religionary Recusants
will either on the account of the Divine Prayer of the holy Iesus for the
uniting his Flock, or of any Scripture-predictions of the more pacific tem|per
that Christians shall at last be blest with, be thus inclined to en|deavour
to shew themselves (as I may say) honest Inconsutulists, and to
forbear dividing our Realm as formerly: but by their Interest so visibly
and palpably concerned in the strengthening the Kingdom, I suppose ne|cessity
of Nature may be instrumental in the accomplishment of such
Scripture-predictions: and just as the Interest and Concern of the Souldi|ers
in the Gospel who hoped to have Christ's seamless Coat come to their
share, inclined them not to rend it and to cast Lots for the same, and where|by
the Scripture was fulfilled as is said in the Gospel.
I have mentioned it out of the Scripture that the Stork knoweth her ap|pointed
times, and the Crane and the Swallow observe the time of their co|ming:
and I may (thinking of a great Prince abroad) add, that the sight
of a numberless Flock of Stares making somewhat like a Cloud in the Air,
and safely flying close together, while there is a Falcon towering above
them, will direct the Populace of several parts of Christendom to Loyalty
and to the natural Garranty of Vnion at home under their respective Go|vernors,
whereby they will be effectually preserved.
As I have in this Discourse entertained your Lordship with somewhat like
a short Historical Account of the accidental encrease and natural decrease
of the Numbers of the Papists in several Conjunctures since the Reformation,
so I shall in my intended Review with the like of those of the Non-Con|formists,
and impartially take notice of the respective Conjunctures of their
petulant insolence: and whereby I shall shew to what strange Principles
of Out-raging our Municipal Laws they were gradually abandoned.
As a Specimen hereof I shall observe, That Ames a Learned Dissenter of
the former Age, in the Preface of his Puritanismus Anglicanus, printed in
the year 1610, speaking of the sufferings of the Clerical Dissenters, saith,

That the Crime they were adjudged guilty of in England was, Quod obsti|naverunt
sese contra leges: and then goeth on to ask, Sed quae tandem
illae quarum grati  vi tot fideles  alis inculpati Ministri sunt bonis
omnibus sedibus pulsi (nam ex altari vivebant) dignitatibus  functio|nibus
suis exuti, faedati etiam existimatione? Sunt autem ne nescias non
fundamentales Regni leges non vetera Majorum scita aut consulta, quorum sum|mam
brevem in Magn (ut appellant) Charta conscriptam habemus: haec
illi Religiosissime colunt: horum fidem implorant; sed Canones nescio qui in
legum fraudem dolo malo confecti,  Parliamentario senatu damnati, vere son|tici,
quos denique adversus ministros inviti,  non sine pudore  in alios cul|pae
trajectione, exercent Authores ipsi, c.
But we may with horror ask, what kind of Laws is it, that those have
Outraged since 41, and some of them since the year 60, and since a par|ticular
Law hath declared the Militia to be solely in the King?
I most humbly take my leave of your Lordship at present, and
am,
My Lord,
Your Lordships most
Faithful Servant.




To the Right Honorable
THE
LORD MARQUESSE
OF
HALIFAX.
MY LORD,
_ACcording to the Common Civility of Ships
paying a Salute to the Forts on the Coasts
they come near, the Course of my handling the
following Subject necessarily giving my
Thoughts an approach to the Considering the
great use that Providence not long ago made
use of your Lordship's great Abilities as a
Fortification for the Defence of the Hereditary Monarchy, I
have held it here but common Iustice to Congratulate to your
Lordship your heroical Loyalty and great Success therein on one
MEMORABLE Day.
It pleas'd God, in whose Book the Members of Mens Bodies,
and Talents of their Minds are written, then to call forth your
Head, and Heart, and Tongue, your flowing Elocution, your
fixt Iudgment, your great Presence of Mind and Thought, your
comprehensive Knowledge of the past Publick Affairs at home and
abroad, and even the generous ferment in your Blood, and to
put them all to signal use in preserving the whole Body of the
Kingdom.
Your Lordship's Goodness was herein the more God-like, for
that as the great benign Father of the Creation was pleas'd with
being a Benefactor to such whose Ingratitude he foreknew, and
to some who would render him as negligent of the Concerns of his
Creatures, and to others who would represent him as unjust in
his Prescriptions, and cruel in his Designs, and taking pleasure

in the Destruction of Souls, so your Lordship was resolv'd on your
Beneficence to your Country in the black Conjuncture of our Fears
and Iealousies, and you were then Communicative of the brightest
Beams and sweetest Influences of your serene and great thoughts
to it, when you knew that by some of the People for your so
doing you would be maligned and mis-represented as an hostis
Patriae.
I shall Presume to give your Lordship no further trouble then
by the syncere Profession of my being
My Lord,
Your Lordship's most Obedient
Servant,
P. P.





THE
OBLIGATION
Relating to the King's
Heirs and Successors
In point of
Conscience discuss'd,
As resulting from the OATHS of ALLE|GIANCE
and SUPREMACY; and
the Takers of those Oaths proved to be thereupon
become bound to bear Faith and True Allegiance
to those HEIRS and SUCCESSORS
in the Due and Legal Course of DESCENT.
I Shall without Proem or Passions here approach to the Great Areo|pagus
of the Court of Conscience, and having stated the Question of
what Obligation to the King's Heirs and Successors, results from the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy in point of Conscience, shall de|liver
my judgment of the same in some Conclusions, and answer Objections
that may occur.
I shall here take Notice that the word Obligation from being Originally
a Band or Ty of the Law for Payment of Debts, hath been since fre|quently
applied to the discharge of Moral Offices. Obligatio est juris
vinculum quo necessitate restringimur alicujus solvendae Rei. Instt. de Ob|ligationibus.
And pursuant hereunto men may be properly said to pay
their Allegiance to Princes in discharge of their Natural Obligations and
their Oaths.
But here I consider not the extent of the Obligation of the Natural Alle|giance
that English Subjects owe their Monarchs, nor yet their Obliga|tion
to Allegiance from the Divine Law positive, nor from the Lex terrae;
tho yet I account it very plain that we are on all those accounts bound
to pay them Allegiance: but do choose to confine my discussion of the
Obligation to Allegiance, as resulting from the Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy, and as mentioned in our Statutes in relation to our King's
Heirs and Successors, and most particularly from that CLAUSE in
the Oath of Allegiance, viz. I will bear Faith and true Allegiance to his

Majesty, his HEIRS and SUCCESSORS, and him and them
will defend to the uttermost of my power against all Conspiracies and At|tempts
whatsoever, which shall be made against his or their Persons, their
Crown and Dignity, c. And THAT in the Oath of Supremacy, viz.
And do promise that from henceforth I shall bear Faith and true Allegiance
to the King's Highness, his Heirs and lawful Successors, and to my power
shall assist and defend all Iurisdictions, Privileges, Preheminences and Au|thorities
granted or belonging to the King's Highness, his Heirs and Succes|sors,
c.
And I here enquire, how far the Obligation resulting from those Clauses
in those Oaths, in Relation to such Heirs and Successors, may be judged in
point of Conscience to extend?
As to the Question thus explained and stated I shall lay down these fol|lowing
Conclusions;
First, That those Oaths (and indeed all others) do respect a Duty
to be performed in the Future time; that is, at the least some time tho
perhaps a very small one after the Obligation contracted, as is well open'd
by Sanderson in his first Lecture of the Obligation of Oaths, and where he
shews that this happens in every Oath assertory as well as promissory: for
whoever sweareth obligeth himself ipso facto to manifest the truth in that
which he is about to say, whether it be in a matter past or present by an Asser|tory;
or in a Future matter by a Promissory Oath.
Secondly, That by that part of an Oath Promissory contained in the
forementioned Clauses of the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, as like|wise
by all other Oaths Promissory, the Party swearing is bound to endea|vour
for the Future as much as in him lieth by his Deeds to fulfil what
he hath sworn in words: and this Sanderson in his second Lecture hath well
asserted as to an Oath Promissory, viz. That he who endeavours not to per|form
that which he hath promised is guilty of Perjury in the Court of Con|science
'Tis plain that in an Assertory Oath, if I took the same with a well|compoed
mind, and have given my Testimony truely, I have discharged
my Duty, and have my Quietus from my Conscience for the same. But
in an Oath Promissory, and particularly in the Promissory part of the Oaths
of Allegiance and Supremacy, I am not discharged by the sincerity of my
intention in my promise. I have engaged my self to Action, and have
lanched my self into a Sea of Business from that time forward till the
end of my life, and as there is occasion and opportunity I am to DO
what in those Clauses I have promised to the King and his Heirs and Suc|cessors.
And thus the Style of DOING runs in Numbers 30. 2. If a
man swear an Oath to bind his Soul with a Bond, he shall DO according
to all that procedeth out of his mouth.
Thirdly, That those Oaths and all others are to be taken in the sense of
the Imposer. For the Oath being taken that the Imposer may be assured
that the promise of the Person swearing shall be effectually made good to
him, there would be no assurance thereof in the least, if the Oath were
to be interpreted otherwise than in the Imposers sense: and under this
Conclusion it may be properly added, that where that sense is sufficiently ma|nifest
in the words, it is exactly to be stood to, as Sanderson hath well
shewed in his second Lecture of the aforesaid Subject, and where having
shewed how we must take heed that we impose not on the Oath we have taken,
or any part thereof other sense than that which any other Pious and Prudent
Man (and who being unconcerned in the Business is of a freer Iudgment) may

easily gather out of the Words themselves, he saith, That we become without
question guilty of the heinous Crime of Perjury, if that milder interpretation
which encouraged us unto the Oath chance to deceive us. And in his 6th
Lecture . 7. he saith, As it is one kind of Perjury to strain the words du|ring
the Act of Swearing unto another Sense than that wherein they are un|derstood
by the Auditors, so it is another kind of Perjury having sworn ho|nestly,
not to proceed sincerely, but to decline and elude the strength of the
Oath (tho the words be preserved) with some new forged inventions, vari|ously
turning and dressing the words to cloak the guilt of their Consciencs as
Tacitus saith of some: and he concludes that Section by saying, That
where the words of an Oath are so clear in themselves, that among honest men
there can be no qustion of their meaning, the Party swearing is obliged in
that sense which they apparently afford, and may not either in swearing or
when he hath sworn, stretch those words upon the last of his Interest by any stu|died
interpretations.
There appeared nothing more detestable to the Eye of the old Civil
Law then fraud and trick, and particularly the destroying the true Sense
and meaning of a Law by a cavilling fraudulent interpretation that retains
the words but confounds the ends for which the Law was made; and ac|cordingly
'tis said in the Digests, In fraudem legis facit qui salvis verbis le|gis,
sententiam ejus circumvenit.
But this in the Case of an Oath was more abominated, and accordingly
Cicero tells us, that Fraus adstringit non dissolvit perjurium. And if the
Civil Law was afterward so provident for the honour of Humane Na|ture
as to determine in the Case of an unask'd free gift, that Cum in ar|bitrio
cujuscunque sit hoc facere quod instituit, oportet eum vel minime ad hoc
prosilire, vel cum venire ad hoc properaverit, non quibusdam excogitatis ar|tibus
suum propositum defraudare, tantamque indevotionem quibusdam quasi
legitimis velamentis prolegere, any one may judge how much it abhorred
any thing of fraud in the evading of the payment of a due subjection to
Sovereign Power acknowledged by what the thinking Heathens term'd
Sacramentum, as if the most eminent, or only thing emphatically Sacred,
and religiously to be observed.
I should not since the Extermination of the Iesuites Doctrine of
Equivocating have thought it worth while so much to dilate on this plain
Conclusion, before the publishing a Pamphlet in our Metropolis in the Year
1680, called An Account of the New Sheriffs holding their Office, made
publick upon reason of CONSCIENCE, respecting themselves and
others in regard to the Act for Corporations, and in which ACT, tho the
Lawgivers meaning of the Oath thereby imposed is most apparently ma|nifest
out of the Words, yet the Author of that Casuistical Pamphlet
makes it lawful to take the Oath and subscribe the Declaration, and not in
the literal strict Construction, but in an imaginary sense topp'd upon the
Lawgivers, and that nothing but a vitiated fancy or injudicious mind could
imagine.
I was sorry to hear that that Pamphlet was writ by a Non-Conformist
Divine: and that in a Conjuncture when the Magistrates of that City were
so hot against the name of Popery, any men should be so zealous for the
Thing called Iesuitism, and that any men by attempting to rivet Equivo|cation
into their Model of Protestancy, should at once endeavour to rob us
of the Energy of the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and of the Test
it self, and to make the sacredness of all Oaths whatsoever to evapo|rate.

Let any sober Person of the Dissenters Party but seriously read that
Pamphlet so scandalous to Protestancy, and it cannot but give him the
Alarm of coming out from among them, for that he must do that would
come out even from the Iesuitick Equivocation.
If there were not a Church of England-Protestancy in that Loyal City,
I may without unjust reflection say it, that Magistrates who were Ac|cessory
to the erecting that Paper-Monument to Equivocation, and to the
trying to help it to a jus Divinum, and to be a part of pure Religion and
undefiled, could bring little honour to our Metropolis by calling it a
PROTESTANT CITY on its Monument of Stone.
As we find in the Book of Iudges that all that saw that inhumane
Butchering and Quartering out into pieces of the Levites Wife by her
own Husband, cried out and said, There was no such thing done or seen
since the time that the Children of Israel came up out of the Land of Egypt
until that day, I believe it may be affirmed that never in any PROTE|STANT
City in the World, since the time that it was free'd from the
Egyptian Servitude of the Papal Impositions, was any such barbarous
butchering of the Obligation of an Oath by Equivocation in a printed
Case sent about the Kingdom by the pretended Espousers of Protestancy,
ever done or seen. And according to the saying, that Nisi serpens ser|pentem
comederit non fit draco, it may be said that the most superlative and
dreadful outraging of Oaths cannot be compassed but by the Consciences
of pretended Protestants digesting the old Equivocation of the Iesu|ites.
When I consider this therefore that the false Protestant Discusser of that
CASE of CONSCIENCE of the SHERIFFS, doth determine
that, by taking up Arms against the King mentioned in the Oath, is to be
meant against HIS RIGHTFUL GOVERNMENT, and that
the Oath must be taken in the SENSE or MEANING of the Major
part of both Houses that passed it, and then makes their meaning so oppo|site
to their words, and do recollect what is so clearly laid down in my
Lord Chancellor Hatton's Treatise concerning Statutes, and the Expositi|ons
of Acts of Parliament, viz. That the Assembly of Parliament being
ended, functi sunt officii and that as to all of the lower House who are by
Election, their Authority is returned to the Electors so clearly that if they
were altogether assembled again for interpretation by a voluntary Meeting,
eorum non esset interpretari, and that then the interpretation of the Sta|tutes
falls into the hands of the Sages of the Law, and when I consider
that great Caution of Sanderson in his said Book, that where we depart from
the words of an Oath to the intent, it must be well proved that there was such
a meaning, I have a great Compassion for men that are trick't into Perjury
by the artifice of any Casuists: and as I have mentioned a Crafty Counsel
at Law to be justly odious, and a Crafty Councellor of State to be more
so, do account a Crafty Casuist to be most abominable.
What effect that Pamphlet hath had in debauching the Consciences of
the Non-Conformists in thus distorting the natural sense of that Oath by a
calumnious and fraudulent interpretation, and whereby such mens tender|ness
of Conscience may have become Armour of Proof against all Oaths,
I know not. The Paper mentions its being design'd for the edifying of
others: and that word of edifying minds me of the saying of, Qui judicat
contra conscientiam, aedificat ad gehennam: and the which too is justly ap|plicable
to a Protestant Casuist that giveth Judgment for equivocation.
And it may with a pious horror be thought of, that if Christianity and

its Morals should happen to be generally depraved by such Sophisms and
Chicanery as that Pamphlet is stuffed with, there may be cause of fear
that the Son of Man at his second coming will not find so much as the old
bona fides of the Heathens on the Earth.
That any Non-Conformists of the present Age may see how much the
Casuistical Theology of that Pamphlet hath degenerated from the Rule
about the interpretation of Oaths that was in vogue among those of the
former, I shall refer them to the Learned Casuistical works of Ames a
Pious and Learned Independent Divine of that Age, printed at Amster|dam
in the Year 1631, and where in his 4th Book, Chap. 22. De Iura|mento,
he very learnedly inveighs against the use of Equivocation and
Mental Reservation in Oaths, and maketh it to be Equivocation, Cm ver|ba
ipsa quae usurpantur sunt ambigui sensus,  illo sensu accipiuntur  jurante,
quem audientes cupit celare ut alio sensu ab ipsis accipiantur; and coming to
determine that Question, viz. In what sense ought the words of an Oath
to be taken? he answers, viz. In that sense that we judge they who hear us
will conceive: that is, regularly in that sense that the words have in the
common use of men: because the signification of words depends on mens use.
And he there afterward coming to this Question, viz. Are the Words of an
Oath always to be taken strictly as they sound? answers, That an Oath, by
reason of the danger of Perjury, is of strict right and interpretation, so that
it may not admit those larger Explications which in other Facts and Sayings
often take place.
Fourthly, As a Humane Law forbidding a thing simply evil, or com|manding
a thing in its own nature good, doth induce a new Obligation
in Conscience, so doth the Addition of an Oath imposed by the Law
for the avoiding of that thing so simply evil, super-induce a farther Ob|ligation
to avoid it: and therefore the Persons who take the Oath of Al|legiance
invoking God as Witness and Revenger that they do plainly and
sincerely acknowledge and swear according to these express words by
them spoken, and according to the plain and common sense and under|standing
of the same words, Without any Equivocation or mental Evasion
or secret Reservation whatsoever, and heartily, willingly, and truely upon
the TRUE FAITH of a CHRISTIAN, are under a more
especial and particular Obligation to abhor all subtle and cavilling inter|pretations
of the sense of the said Oath.
Fifthly, As the plain and common sense and understanding of the
words in the Clauses respecting the Future time of bearing Faith and true
Allegiance to his Majesty, c. do lay an actual Promissory Obligation on the
swearer to bear the same to him during his life, so reddendo singula singu|lis,
they lay an actual Promissory Obligation on the swearer to bear the
same to his Heirs and Successors afterward in the Due and Legal Course of
Descent.
The Promise in the Clause of the Oath of Supremacy runneth thus, viz.
and DO Promise that FROM HENCEFORTH I WILL bear
Faith, c. And words could not express an actual Obligation incurr'd
and to have some Operation in the next Moment of time, both in relation
to his Majesty and his Heirs and Successors, more clearly than those have
expressed the same. And the Promise sworn in the Clause of the Oath of
Allegiance, viz. I will bear Faith, c. doth likewise after the Oath sworn
immediately operate in its Obligation to the King and his Heirs and Suc|cessors
in the next Interval of Time imaginable, however the word hence|forth
be not there used as in the former Oath: for the Clause of the Oath

of Allegiance binding me not only to preserve the King, but the Heredi|tary
Monarchy, I could not be effectually enough by the Oath obliged to
the same without being obliged in the shortest time afterward, not only
to forbear prejudicing any right that belongs to the King and his Heirs
and Successors, but to defend the same.
The pointing of men to an ordinary Lease where the Lessee at the per|fecting
thereof enters into an actual Obligation both in Law and Conscience
to pay his Rent to the Lessor, his Heirs and Assigns, that is, as it shall be|come
due to each respectively, shews a present actual Obligation incurr'd
of discharging any Future Dues successively, and (as I said) reddendo
singula singulis, to be familiar enough to common thought and vulgar
apprehensions, and likewise the word Heirs to be so too.
The many who take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy have spent
enough time, and perhaps too much ventured eternity, in thinking of and
providing for their Heirs; and who commonly as landed men know that
by virtue of right either immediately or mediately derived from the
Crown, they are only enabled to say, They are seized of this or that Land
in their Demesne as of Fee, and which is as much as to say, It is their De|mesne
or proper Land after a sort, because it is to them and their Heirs, and
that such Fee doth vi termini imply Fealty, and Fealty sworn: and the
thought of which would on the turning of the Tables make them suffici|ently
apprehensive of their danger, if there could be any ambiguity in the
word Heir, or the Crown granting Land to them and their Heirs for|ever.
I shall here take occasion by the way to reflect on an Antimonarchical
saying I met with printed, as spoke in Parliament by a great Demagogue
some years ago, viz. That the Cottager here holds his right by the same Te|nure
that the Crown holds its. For it is false that our King or the Crown
oweth Fealty to any Superior, but God only. The King's Throne is the
Throne of God, and the Style of Crown'd Heads is Dei grati, and by him
Kings Reign.
But to proceed. If there could be Ambiguity in the word Heirs, the
worth of our Magna Charta would soon be depretiated, and it would be but
Res unius aetatis; and particularly where it saith, Concessimus Deo  hac
praesenti charta confirmavimus pro nobis  HAEREDIBVS nostris in
perpetuum, quod Ecclesia Anglicana libera sit  habeat omnia jura sua inte|gra
 libertates suas illaesas, and whereby the British Churches are secu|red
under a Prince of any Religion from Foreign Arbitrary impositions
But indeed the Style current in Magna Charta is, that our Kings for
themselves and their Heirs forever, did grant the Customs and Liberties
contained in that Charter to our Ancestors and their Heirs for ever.
Our Ancestors had no occasion to spend time in seeking Knots in a
Bull-rush or hidden Sense in the words HEIRS and the King's
HEIRS, when so anciently as by the Oath of Fealty (which every Person
above fourteen years old, and every Tythingman was obliged to take pub|lickly
at the Court-Leet within which he lived) they were sworn to the
King and his HEIRS: and that Oath was taken a fresh every year by
all the Subjects under Edward the Confessor and William the first, and is
thus set down by Pryn in his Concordia Discors, viz. I A. B. do swear that
FROM THIS DAY FORWARDS I will be Faithful and Loyal
to our Lord the King AND HIS HEIRS, c.

The instances are innumerable of Allegiance anciently Sworn to our
Kings and their Heirs; and this one for example occureth to me as
Sworn in the time of Edward the 4th. viz. Sovereign Lord, I Henry
Percy become your Subject and Leige-man, and promit to God and you, that
hereafter, I Faith and Troth shall bear to you as to my Sovereign, Leige-Lord,
and to your Heirs, Kings of England, of Life and Limb, and of
Earthly Worship, to Live and Die against all Earthly People, and to you,
and to your Commandments, I shall be Obeysant as God me help, and his
Holy Evanglists. 27. Oct. 9. Ed. 4. Claus. 9. Ed. 4. m. 13. in dorso.
Mr. Pryn likewise in that Book of his beforemention'd saith, that there
was an ancient Oath of Fealty and Allegiance, both by the Subjects of
England, and Kings, Bishops, Nobles and Subjects of Scotland, made to
the Kings of England and Their Heirs, as Supreme Lords of Scotland,
in these words, viz. Ero fidelis  legalis, fidemque  legalitatem servabo
Henrico Regi Angliae  haeredibus suis, de vit  membris  terreno
honore, contra omnes qui possunt vivere  mori:  nunquam pro aliquo
portabo arma, nec ero in consilio vel auxilio contra eum vel Haeredes suos,
c. which Oath he saith, William, King of Scots, and all his Nobles Swore
to King Henry the second,  haeredibus suis sicut ligio Domino suo, and
John Balliol, John Comyn, with all the Nobles of Scotland, to King Ed|ward
the first and his Heirs.
He there likewise gives an account how the Nobles of England Swore
Fealty to Richard King of England, and to his Heirs against all men, and
how the Citizens of London Swore the like Oath; and, That if King Ri|chard
should die without Issue, they would receive Earl John his Brother for
their King and Lord,  juraverunt ei fidelitatem Contra omnes homines,
salva fidelitate Richardi Regis fratris sui, as Hoveden relates.
And he moreover cites the Record of the Writ, issued to all the Sheriffs
of England, soon after the Birth of Edward the 1st. Son and Heir to
King Henry the 3d. To Summon all Persons above 12 years old to Swear
Fealty to him, as Heir to the King, and to submit themselves faithfully to
him, as their Liege Lord after his Death. This form of the Oath in the
Writ is there mention'd to that effect, viz. Quod ipsi salvo homagio  fide|litate
nostr, qu nobis tenentur,  cui in vit nostr nullo modo renunciare
volumus, fideles eritis Edwardo filio nostro primogenito, ita quod si de
nobis humanitus Contigerit, eidem tanquam Haeredi nostro  domino
suo ligio erunt fideliter intendentes  eum pro domino suo ligio haben|tes:
And he there shews how they were Summon'd and Sworn accor|dingly;
and further how in the Parliament of H. 4. The Lords Spiritual
and Tempral, and Commons were Sworn to bear Faith and true Allegiance
to the King, to the Prince and his Issue, and to every one of his Sons, seve|rally
succeeding to the Crown of England: And he there mentions more
Oaths taken to our Kings and their Heirs of the like Nature.
The Consideration hereof would make any one wonder at the Confi|dence
of a late Learned Lawyer, and positive pretender to Omniscience
in our English Antiquities and Records, who in his Detestable Book called
The Rights of the Kingdom, (and which contains a farrago of Impious
Anti-monarchical Principles, and Printed in London, 1649. and there to
the Scandal of the English and Protestant Name, lately Re-printed by
some Factious Anti-Papists) hath averred, That our Allegiance was of old
tyed to the Kings Person, not unto his Heirs, and for the Kings Heirs
(saith he there) I find them not in our Allegiance. And he mentions the
Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, as enjoyn'd in Queen Elizabeth's and

King Iames's time respectively, to be the first that were made, to the Kings
Person and his HEIRS and SVCCESSORS.
But to return to the Cause in hand; 'Tis sufficient for the Obligation I
press, that HEIRS and SUCCESORS are so clearly expressed in
the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy.
And tho the Statute of 1^. Elizabethae, in the Clause of the Annex|ing
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction to the Crown, useth the style of Your High|ness,
your Heirs and Successors, Kings or Queens of this Realm shall have
full Power, c. as the Statue of the Supremacy 26^o. Henry 8th.
runs in the Style of our Sovereign Lord, his Heirs and Successors, Kings
of this Realms, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed, the only Supreme
Head, and tho the Oath in the 35th. H. the 8th. Cap. 1. that re|lates
to the bearing Faith, Truth, and true Allegiance to the Kings Maje|sty,
and to his Heirs and Successors, c. be further thus expressed, viz.
And that I shall accept, repute, and take the Kings Majesty, his Heirs and
Successors (when they or any of them shall enjoy his place) to be the only
Supreme Head, c. and tho' the old Oath of the Mayor of London and
other Cities and Towns throughout England, and of Bayliffs, or other
chief Officers, where there are no Mayors, runs in the style of Swearing,
That they shall well and Loyally Serve the King in the Office of Mayor, in
the City of L. and the same City, shall keep surely and safely to the use of
our Lord the King of England, and of his Heirs, Kings of England,
might give occasion for that great, empty, and big-sounding Sophism of
Sir W. I. in his famous Speech, wherein he said, That we are Sworn
to the King, his Heirs and Lawful Successors, but not Obliged to any, dur|ing
the Kings Life, but to himself; for it were Treason if it were other|wise;
yet let any Man lay his hand upon his Heart and bend his Ear
to the still voice of his Conscience, and will he not find that both those
Clauses in the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, do necessarily imply the
bearing such Faith and Allegiance, first entirely to the King during his
Life, and after his Demise, bearing the same to his Heirs and Successors,
when they shall become Kings or Queens of this Realm? and that thus,
Quod necessar, subintelligitur, non deest, and that the Oath of Supremacy
begins with the Declaring, that the Kings Highness IS the only Supreme
Governor of this Realm, c. and that of Allegiance, with declaring in
like manner, that the King IS Lawful and Rightful King of this Realm, and
that the bearing Faith and Allegiance to the King, doth imply the Ius in
re, as to our Fealty and Allegiance to the King, Contra omnem hominem,
during the Kings Life; and doth at present imply (as I may) jus ad rem,
to his Heirs and Successors after his Demise.
Undoubtedly it was not the design of the Oaths of Allegiance and Su|premacy,
to oblige us to impossible things; for that no Oath can do. And
under the notion of things Impossible, the Civil Law hath well ranged all
Actions which wound Piety Reputation and our Modesty, and which are a|gainst
good manners, by that known place, Quae facta laedunt pietatem, ex|istimationem,
verecundiam nostram, , ut generaliter dixerimquae contra bonos
mores fiunt, nec facere nos posse Credendum est. The Canon Law likewise
hath well told us, that juramentum contra bonos mores non est obligatorium.
And the Law of Nature and all Divine and Humane Laws have taught
us, that nothing doth more wound Piety and Reputation, and Common
Modesty to the Heart, or is more against good Manners, than the out|raging
our Oath of Obedience, or Allegiance to our Prince; and it may
well be Judged impossible for a Prince to require from his Subjects their

Swearing to pay the entire Allegiance to another, at that time while it
was due only to himself.
For as all Oaths are stricti juris in their Interpretation, so the word
Allegiance or Ligeance doth vi te mini imply the strictest obligation to
the Prince imaginable; and accordingly as the expression of alligare fidem
juramento, is found in Seneca. And this Obligation is partly of the na|ture
of what the Feudists call Homagium ligium, distinguishing homage
into ligium and non ligium, and making ligium to be that which is done to
Soveraign Princes only, no fidelity to any one else reserved: and only
to be fealty Sworn contra omnem hominem, nullo excepto; whereupon
their rule is, that none can be homo ligius duorum, i. e. at the same time.
And any one who shall cast his Eye on our Book of the Terms of the
Law, will there find the homagium ligium got in from among the old
Feudists; and the Author making the Figure of Homage to be more
Solemn than the Oath of Fealty, in which Oath the Tenant saith to his
Lord, I shall be to you Faithful and Loyal; and shall bear to you Faith
for the Lands and Tenements which I claim to hold of you, and truly shall
do you the Customs and Services that I ought to do you at the Terms Assign|ed:
So help me God. But in Homage there is Kneeling requied; and
the Tenant saith on his Knees, I become your Man from this day forward,
of Life and Member, and of earthly honour, and to you shall be Faithful and
Loyal, and shall bear to you Faith for the Lands that I claim to hold of
you, saving the Faith that I owe to our Lord the King.
Sir Edward Cook likewise entertains us with somewhat of the Homagi|um
ligium, and he very well and usefully in his Calvins Case explains
the nature of the Subjects ligeance and makes it to be a true and faith|ful
Obedience of the Subject due to his Soveraign; and there saith, that
Ligiance is expressed by several terms which are Synonimous in our Books,
and is sometimes called obedientia Regi, and that Ligiance is sometimes
called Faith, fides, ad fidem Regis; and there mentioning the Homage
out of Litleton, Salve le foy quod Ieo doy a nostre sur le Roy, quotes Glan|vil
l. 9. c. 1. for the Salvo required in Homage, viz. Salv fide debit
Domine Regi  Haeredibus suis.
It may therefore be here said, that our Ancestors in the contexture of
the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, intended no Idle words, but did
with exact care weigh every expression and word of them in aurificis
Stater.
According to that trite wise saying, hominum malitiis obviandum est,
they prepared to encounter with the Clamour of some Romane Catholicks,
who might possibly think to run down the Oath of Allegiance, with the
cry of The New Oath; and as they afterwards tryed to do, suitably to their
old term of the New Evangel: And therefore when they framed the
words in the clause of these Oaths, which runs, much as I have shewn in
the old stile of the former Oaths used long before the Reformation, they
did stare super vias antiquas, as I may say; and in these Oaths of llegi|ance
and Supremacy, the Kings Heirs do not come in without deep pre|caution,
and not as Ceremonious attendants on the Kings Person (as I may
say) but in order to the Support of the Hereditary Monarchy, and as I
shall shew more by and by out of the words of the Oaths. The Lawgivers
ventured no danger of answering at the day of Iudgement for any idle
words, and much less for Captious ones in the Oaths: And 'tis a delirium
to think that they should make it Treason in some Cases, to refuse one

of those Oaths, and make it too Treason to practice it; and that the Oath
of Allegiance obliging men to endeavor to disclose to his Majesty, his
HEIRS and SVCCESSORS, all TREASONS which they shall know or
hear of, to be against him or EITHER of them, the Obligation to the
Kings Heirs and Successors, in the words immediately foregoing, could im|ply
any thing of Treason.
We know that as to any thing written, interpretatio facienda est ex
totius Seripturae Contextu, and that pro expresso id habetur quod Colligitur
ex eo quod expressum est; and that if any one shall deliberately mind the
Contexture of those Oaths, and what is therein so liquidly expressed and
asserted, that those Oaths which were intended as all others to put an
end to all Strife, do make none between our Kings, their Heirs and Suc|cessors.
But all men of sense and thought cannot but grant, that in the Clauses
as relating to the Kings HEIRS and SUCCESSORS, we are to judge
according to the Rule of Interpretation, viz. that verba non debent esse oci|osa,
sed ita intelligi dbent ut aliquid operentur, and that verba cum effectu
sunt accipiena: And as 'tis said in the Civil Law, Semper in stipulati|onibus
 in caeteris contractibus, id sequimur quod ACTVM est; and as
actus is there taken for a general word, sive re sive verbis quid AGA|TVR;
here is an ACT of the Swearer, done in relation to such HEIRS and
SUCCESSORS: and he is promittendi reus in the Civil Law Phrase, and
as he is there called Reus, qui debitor est, omninoque obligatus ex quavis
Causa, and as he who hath promised any thing is said Reus debendi; and
so Reus constitutus dicitur qui se obligavit. ff. Quod met. Caus. l. 14. .
Labeo.
But on the whole matter, our Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy con|tain
in them nothing impossible, and nothing ambiguous, and do ipso facto
or in plain English, oblige us as soon as taken to be ready to pay our
Allegiance to the King, and afterward to his Heirs and Successors as re|spectively
due according to the Legal Course of Descent.
And if any one be frightned with Sir W. I's. Day-Dream of Treason,
viz. in being immediately upon the taking of the Oaths under some Obli|gation
to the Kings Heirs and Successors, let him repair to our Statute-Book
and he will there find as good Bail provided for him in the Case
as Heaven and Earth can give: for in the Preamble of an Act of Parlia|ment
the King and three Estates tell him of the Duty that every true and
well affected Subject, not only by BOND of Allegiance, but also by the COM|MANDMENT
of Almighty God, OVGHT to perform to his Majesty,
his HEIRS and SUCCESSORS, 7^o Iac. c. 6.
In fine, I shall hereupon affirm, that should any English Subject, who
hath taken these Oaths live to the age of Nestor, and in the course of Na|ture,
ee several of our Kings Heirs and Successors, in the due and Legal
course of Descent, Succeeding one another; and should such Subject be
never call'd on to reiterate those Oaths in the Reign of any of them, he
would yet by these Oaths before once taken, continue obliged to bear
true Faith and Allegiance to them all Successively.
And thus in the first faederal Oath we read of, the Father of the faithful,
obliged himself at once in relation to Abimelech and his SON, and his
SONS SON: and we know how afterward God was pleased to oblige
himself at once to Abraham and his SEED; and how after that God
was pleased to oblige himself by his Oath and Covenant made to David

and his SEED, as to their Succession in the Royal Throne of Iuda: And
'twas to this the words in the Psalms, ONCE have I Sworn, c.
refer.
And therefore this Scriptural Representation of God, after the manner
of Men, condescending in the Government of the world, to bind himself
ex grati, as aforesaid, may well inculcate to us the reasonableness of our
becoming ipso facto bound by our Oaths to pay the debitum Iustitiae to
his Vice-Roys and their HEIRS and SUCCESSORS.
To proceed therefore, I shall lay down this as a 6th Conclusion, and
genuinely deducible from the former one, viz. That by Virtue of those
two Clauses, the takers of those Oaths do particularly bind themselves not
only against the Aiding and Assisting or Abetting any Rebellion or any
Vsurpation of the rights of his Majesty's Heirs and Successors that can
happen; but to the aiding and assisting of the Crown, and preserving its
Inheritable Rights on all Emergent occasions.
Sanderson in his 4th Lecture of the Obligation of Oaths, puts the Case
concerning the Person to whom an Oath was made, viz. Whether he who
hath Sworn the performance of a thing to another, the Party to whom he
Sware being deceased, be bound to make it good to the Heirs and Successors
of the said Party? And his words are: I answer, ordinarily he is. It is
certain that the Party Swearing is obliged if he express'd that he would
perform the Oath unto the Heirs of the other. It may also be taken for
granted, that he is bound tho he expressed it not, if the Oath taken relates
to DIGNITY, because DIGNITY varies not with the change of Persons.
Whence if any Subject or Souldier Swear Fidelity to his King or General,
the Oath is to be meant to be made unto them also who succeed to that
Dignity.
Yet Ames our Learned Non-conformist in his Case of Conscience, 4th
Book, Chapter 22. viz. De Iuramento: as to the 11th Question, and about
the Obligation of an Oath Ceasing, saith, Quum aufertur ratio juramenti, ju|ramentum
cessat ratione Eventus: qui casus est eorum, qui jurarunt se obe|dituro
Domino, aut Principi alicui, qui postea cessat esse talis.
But perhaps had the Case of so strict an Oath, as that of Allegiance to
our Prince and his HEIRS and SUCCESSORS layn before him, he
would have writ otherwise of its Obligation. For as the Consideation
of the formentioned Clauses in the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy
did sufficiently prevail with the Ejected and Persecuted Divines of the
Church of England, and most of its Lay Members, to avoid all sinful
Compliance with the late Vsurpation and Vsurpers; so it did likewise
with many of the Presbyterians and others, to avoid the same, and par|ticularly
to refuse the taking the ENGAGEMENT set up by the Republi|cans,
and even to Publish in Print their holding themselves obliged by
those Oaths so to do.
I shall instance in two that did so; Mr. Pryn in his Book before cited
mentions those OATHS as in direct words extending not only to the late
King's Person (mentioning King Charles the 1st) but his HEIRS and
SUCCESSORS, and Inviolably binding the Swearers in perpeuity in point
of LAW and CONSCIENCE, so long as there is any Heir of the Crown,
and Royal Line in being; and that upon many Vnanswerable Scriptural Pre|cedents
and Legal Considerations, c.
He had before charged those with apparent Perjury, who had taken
those Oaths to the King and his HEIRS, and yet repute those few Reliques
of the old Parliament then sitting (forcibly secluding the Lords and Majo|rity

of their Fellow Members) to be a lawful Parliament, within the Sta|tute
of 17 Car. Cap. 7. or submit to any Oaths, Taxes, or Edicts of theirs
as Parliamentary or Legal.
I refer the Reader to the Book, and which, because somewhat Scarce, I
think to have reprinted.
The other Person of the Presbyterian Communion I shall refer to for
this, is the Author of a learned Tract in 4^t^o printed in the year 1650 called,
An EXERCITATION concerning VSVRP'D POWERS,
wherein the Author very substantially proves that by virtue of the Ob|ligation
to the King's HEIRS and SUCCESSORS resulting
from the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, it is not lawful to give up
ones self to the ALLEGIANCE of an VSVRP'D Power: and
saith very well in p. 16. If I should do that, I should yield assistance to
the Vsurper in his wrong Doing and Vsurpation, and so become a partaker
of his Sin. Obedience to one as the Supreme Magistrate is a Comprehen|sive
thing, and includes many duties toward him, as a Power, viz. of recei|ving
Commission from him for Offices, or Acts otherwise not competible to me:
maintaining and defending him in his Power by Pay, Counsel, and Intelligence,
Arms and Prayers: all which I am bound to yield the Usurper to my power,
if I resign my Allegiance up to him: and how shall I do these things, and not.
1. Support and have Communion with him in his wickedness. 2. Combine
against betray and resist the right of the injured, dethroned Magistrate.
3. And make my self uncapable of Obedience or being a Subject to the lawful
Power hereafter?
The Author doth in p. 19 and many other places in this Book, assert
the forementioned Clauses in the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy as
binding clearly, plainly, and in terminis to an Allegiance over-living his
Majesties Person and pitched upon his HEIRS and SUCCESSORS,
so that the Swearer is not free from the Oaths at his Majesties decease, c.
and that those Oaths intend by his Majesty's HEIRS and SUCCES|SORS
the same Persons joyning them together with the Copulative
(AND) and not using the Discretive (OR) and the former Oath twice
comprising both in the following Clauses, under the said Term or Pronown
(viz. THEM, THEIRS) so that according to these Oaths his
HEIRS are of right his SUCCESSORS, and none can be HIS
SUCCESSOR, but HIS HEIR, while he hath an HEIR:
and that if any Conspiracy or ATTEMPT be made to prevent his
HEIR from being and continuing his SVCCESSOR, or to make any
one HIS SVCCESSOR that is not HIS HEIR (if he hath one)
the subject is sworn by this Oath to continue his Allegiance to HIS
HEIR as the right SVCCESSOR, and to DEFEND HIM
in that HIS right to the uttermost: and that the Term LAWFUL
annext to SVCCESSORS in the Oath of Supremacy, manifestly ex|cludes
all CAVIL of a distinction between HEIRS and SVC|CESSORS:
the word LAWFVL whether you interpret it of
LEGITIMATION of BIRTH, or PROXIMITY of
SVCCESSION in regard of LINE according to the Law of the
Land entailing the Crown on his Majesty's Issue, or rather both the latter in|cluding
the former, restraining SVCCESSORS from meaning any o|ther
than HIS HEIRS: and that both these Oaths bind the Swear|er
to assist and defend to his uttermost Power against all Attempts the Course
of SVCCESSION in the Race of his Majesty, expressed by many-Terms,
to wit, THEIR Crown and Dignity, all Iurisdictions, Privi|leges,

Preheminences and Authorities granted to the King's Highness,
HIS HEIRS and SVCCESSOR and united to the Imperial
CROWN of this Realm. How then can he yield Obedience to them that
are not HIS HEIRS, nor LAWFUL SVCCESSORS, c.
how can he not oppose and withstand them in the assistance and defence of the
right of his Majesty's HEIRS and LAWFVL SVCCES|SORS?
That judicious Author did like a substantial Confessor of the Obligatori|ness
of those Oaths relating to the King's HEIRS and SUCCES|SORS
during that Vsurpation, very satisfactorily shew, that the
SAME Persons were meant by both, and held himself obliged in Loy|alty
the rather so to do, because in that Conjuncture the plain Sence of
the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy were usurp'd upon, and particu|larly
by the Book called, THE LAWFULNESS OF OBEY|ING
THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT, then published;
and the Fallacies in which he Learnedly Confuted, and shewed how ri|diculously
that Book outraged the sense of the Law-givers in those Oaths,
whose end was to support the Crown in a just Lineal Succession, and could
therefore intend by Successors, only such as were de jure so: and that
therefore that Book's taking Successors for such who were so de facto (tho
very unjustly) was; 1. Inconsistent with the nature of an Oath, which
must be taken in Righteousness. Jer. 4. 2. That is to oblige only to that
which is just. 2. With the word HEIRS, which being placed first in the
Oath must first be served. 3. With the Oath of Supremacy which binds us
to the lawful Successor. 4. With the Law of the Land which appointeth
Succession to the Heir. 5. With a possibility of keeping the Oath: for if
Heirs and Successors mean divers Persons, how can the Oath of Allegiance
and defence of the Regal Dignity be observed?
Thus it seems as the Fantome of haeres viventis hath frighted many
out of their Natural Senses, and the Natural sense of their Oaths in the
present Conjuncture, the word SUCCESSORS did formerly: and
when they who interpreted it of actual Succeders (as saith my Author)
that it might favour the USURPERS forgot what was the Object of
that Succession, viz. a CROWN and Regal Dignity, wherein by virtue
of that Oath those Successors are to be defended, whereas those or the Re|publicans
for whom the Book pleads, have not only put by the rightful Suc|cessor,
but abolished the CROWN and Regal Dignity it self.
May this instance of Heavens uncrowning the understandings of those
Republicans of common reason and sense (and when in the Course of their
injudicious minds they were abandoned to the most despicable sort of
Counterfeit Witt called Quibbling, and to the vilest sort of Quibbling and
double entendre of words, I mean in that which concerns the tremendous
Obligation of an Oath, after they had Dethroned their Prince, and excluded
his Heirs and Successors) serve in all Future times as a Monument of the
Divine Dereliction, and of Heavens scattering the Proud in their reasons
and imaginations of their hearts, and rendring them unfortunate beyond
the fate of the common saying of Eventus stultorum magister, I mean by
condemning them to a stated infatuation: and let none hereafter value
any Vsurpation on the Credit of the last, as Mr. Ienkins in his famous
Petition to the Vsurpers did, and set Gods Seal to it on the account of
the Event, when the Event was what I have now mentioned.
Any one who will cast an Eye on the Title de verborum significatione in
the Civil Law, will there find the word Heir to be necessarily made Compre|hensive

of SUCCESSORS, viz. Haeredis significatione omnes signifiri
SUCCESSORES redendum est, etsi verbis non sint expressi; and
Succession is under that Title of the Law made a part of the definition of
inheritance, viz. Nihil est aliud haereditas quam successio in universum jus
quod defunctus habuit.
And the identity of the thing in the words of Heirs and Successors doth
quadrare with that saying so frequent among the Civil Law Writers that
Plura quando copulantur ad unum effectum, loco unius habentur, and with ano|ther
that the word  sometimes stat declarative inter duo idem impor|tantia.
I should account it somewhat like Pedantry to cite any Latine Authors
about Heirs and Successors signifying as here in our Case the same thing,
but that other Seditious Books beside that impugned by the Exercita|tion,
have endeavoured to sow Contention between the words Heirs and
Successors, tho with as little sense as was in Sir W. I's fancy of Treason,
whereby he would have set the Assertory and the Promissory Clauses in the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy at variance, nay the Promissory Clause
at variance with it self.
There was a Book writ by a late Lawyer called, Historical Discourses
of the Vniformity of the Government of England, first printed in the
Year 1647, and reprinted by some Factious Anti-Papists since the Epoche
of our Fears and Iealousies of Popery, and with that former year in the
Title (which was an ill ominous sign of the fatal time such Persons would
have driven us back upon if they could) where in p. 279 of the 2d part
ill reflections are made on the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, which
Oaths (saith the Author) do make much Parly concerning Inheritance
and Heirs: but that they do not hold forth any such Obligation to Heirs
otherwise than as supposing them to be Successors, and in that Relation only.
His design is too plainly express'd, viz. to strike at the Rights of our He|reditary
Monarchy, and to invite Parliaments to interlope in controuling
the Succession of the Crown: and he saith, That the Doctrine he there insinu|ates
doth not go down well with those that do pretend to Prerogative, aided by
the Act of Recognition made to King James, and the Oaths of Supremacy and
Allegiance: and I shall say that I hope it never will: and 'tis pity but a
Book that in so many places of it impeacheth the old known Rights of the
Crown, should in this Conjuncture of Loyalty find some Person at leisure ex
professo to make Animadversions on it, and the rather for that the Author
doth in the Vehicle of somewhat like Witt (and his affectation of which is
by People of middling Capacities, who generally make the greater part
of Mankind, judged to be Witt) dispense his Poysons.
Yet as to the signification of HEIRS and SUCCESSORS, he
had before in his first part saved any one the labour of shewing their
Identity: for there in p. 109 and in his Chapter of the Laws of Property
of Lands and Goods under the Saxons, he quoted Tacitus about some of the
Customs of the Germans which he judged remain'd here with them, and
which shewed that HEIRS and SUCCESSORS passed then as
current Coyn for the same thing, according to the words of Tacitus, HAE|REDES
 SVCCESSORES cuique liberi  nullum est testamen|tum,
and thus Englished by that Author, viz. the HEIRS and SVCCES|SORS
to every one are his Children, and there is no Testamentary Pow|er
to DISHERIT or ALTER the COVRSE of DESCENT
which by CVSTOM or Law is setled.

And as was shewed, the Term of LAWFVL annexed to SUCCES|SORS,
hath nailed the Canon of that Sophism, and exposed the ridiculous|ness
of any Cavilling or Calumnious Interpretation about Heirs and Suc|cessors:
tho yet without the interposal of the word LAWFVL, the
plain sense of the words Heirs and Successors in the Oaths would clearly
enough have obliged us to the same Persons. We say, that id possumus
quod jure possumus, and none are to be construed Heirs or Successors, but
such who are so in the Eye of the Law, and with reference to Proximity
of Blood, i. e. they who are meant for such by the Law in the Due
Course of their Descent.
But I hope that England's happy Future State will so far influence
Loyalty, as to incline all Conscientious Protestants to leave of all senseless
Cavilling about the sense of the plain words in those Oaths, and to agree
to employ their most serious and constant thoughts about the extent of
the Moral Offices that relate to their bearing True Faith and Allegiance to
the King, his Heirs and Successors, and other very important matters in
the Promissory Clauses most clearly expressed in order to the discharge
of their Allegiance, and the duties of Loyalty, viz. DEFENDING
him and them to the uttermost of our Power against all Conspiracies that
shall be made against his or their Persons, their Crown and Dignity, as the
Oath of Allegiance runs, and to our ASSISTING and DEFEN|DING
to our Power all Iurisdictions, Privileges, Preheminences and Au|thorities
granted or belonging to the King's Highness, his Heirs and Successors.
There are no unweigh'd and idle words in the Promissory Clauses,
and we are to make it our business with the judgment of discretion
to consider the sense of the same, and to retain it in our Memories: and
mens not doing which, hath been the Cause of the Ebb of Loyalty in some
Conjunctures. According to the Degrees of mens intellectual Talents,
and particularly the Talent of understanding beyond other men the
Laws natural and positive, and the Lex terrae, some are beyond others
morally bound to defend the particular momentous points relating to
all Iurisdictions, Privileges, Preheminences granted or belonging to the King
and his Heirs and Successors: and therefore a disloyal Divine and a dis|loyal
Lawyer, are things that do particularly hear very ill.
But as there is a great part of the Moral Offices expressed in these
Oaths sufficiently plain and obvious to vulgar Capacities, and which
with their Native Light do strike common understandings, so the extent
of these Offices ought to employ the Meditations of all the Takers of these
Oaths; and how low soever their Talents lie, they are to use all the means
they can, and particularly that of the Consilium peritorum, as any occa|sion
shall offer it self, for their defence of any of the Privileges or Pre|heminences
belonging to the Crown. Our duty in this kind is very well
expressed by Sanderson in his third Lecture, where speaking of the Subjects
Obligations by Oaths of this Nature, he saith, Doubtless the Subject to his
Power is obliged to defend all Rights which appear either by Law or Custom
Legitimate, whether defined by the written Law, or in force through the long
use of time or Prescription, that is, so far as they are known, or may Mo|rally
be known. But he is not equally obliged to the Observation of all those
which are controverted. Thus therefore as to any Iurisdiction, Privilege or
Preheminence of the Crown that might seem doubtful, the swearer is many
times bound to the use of means that it may be Morally known to him, as
Sanderson's words are.

Yet what I have urged in this sixth Conclusion as Obligatory to us by
virtue of the Oaths, is sufficiently plain, and there is no occasion for em|ploying
a great Genius and penetrating Understanding and Witt to disco|ver
that it is one of the Privileges of the Crown to be Hereditary, and
that the Taker of the Oaths is indissolubly bound to defend that
Right.
There are several explicatory Notions of the word DEFEND and
its extent, that often occur in the Authors that treat expressly of the Ius
Protectitium seu defensorium, among whom I account Magerus de Advoca|ti
armat or of the Right of Protection given by Sovereign Powers, to
be instar omnium, and who in the 12th Chapter there Critically descanting
on the nature of the Defence granted by Protectors, saith, That verbum
protegere necessitatem defendendi cum armis importat, and that protector, si
in defensionis promissione jaramentum appositum fuerit, etiam non requisitus,
clientibus succurrere tenetur: and that defendere non videtur, qui in totum
non defendit: and that ffectum defensionis non dicitur consummat implere
qui non omni tempore, auxilio suo ac defensione praest est. He there likewise
tells us, that subditi tenentur defendere honorem Regis: and that DEFENCE
is too performed by Words as well as Deeds: and mentions how in so|lenni
fidelitatis juramento vasallus se ad id obstringit quod vitam  hono|rem
famamque Domini non solum non violare, sed  contra aliorum conatus
pro viribus defendere ac propugnare velit.
But none need look abroad for the genuine importance of the word
DEFEND: for any man of common sense who hath taken the Oaths
knoweth by the Recollection of his ordinary thoughts what it is to DE|FEND
himself, and how natural it is for the hand to lit up and expose
it self to defend the head from danger, and knoweth by the Call of the
Magistracy when and where and how by Arms to defend his Prince; and
natural Logick tells him that he who in these Oaths hath bound himself to
ASSIST, hath certainly bound himself not to RESIST, and that de|fendere
qui tenetur offendere non debet: and that therefore whoever hath
taken the Oaths, and alloweth the Doctrine of Resistance, is a real Heretick,
and Self-Condemned: and that according as it is neither deniable nor deni|ed
by those who talk of haeres viventis, the Taker of these Oaths hath
bon fide and in the good faith of a Christian promised the same vigorous
defence of the Rights of those Heirs and Successors in the first moment of
the descent of the Crown to them, that is to say, immediately on the King's
Decease, that he is to perform as to the Rights of the present King, and
that here being a Promise of Defence to the King and his Heirs, Promit|tens
duobus vel pluribus, dicitur promittere separatim  cuilibet pro vi|rili:
and that the Rights of the Prince Regnant are not in the least pre|judiced
by this Promise, for that obligatus duobus in solidum, est obligatus
secundo, salvo jure primi, and that verba sunt intelligenda habito respectu
rei  personae ad quam referentur.
And the word BELONGING i. e. All Iurisdictions, Privileges,
c. Granted or BELONGING to the King's Highness, his Heirs and
Successors, as it sufficiently ensures our Obligations of defending the same to
our Kings in Case of Usurpation made against them, how prosperous so|ever
it may be, so it ensures our Obligation of the defence to his Heirs in
the due Course of the Descent: and holds our hands from paying Allegi|ance
to any Vsurper. The Law of God and the Land sufficiently shew to
whom those Iurisdictions, c. BELONG, that we have sworn to de|fend:

and the Civil Law doth here appositely tell us, that Possessio etiam
animo retinetur, and doth account the very fraud that may exclude a
right Heir to be Tantamount to a Possession: Quia pro possessione dolus est.
And according to that Law, Qui actionem habet ad rem, ipsam rem habere
videtur: and habere quilibet dicitur quod jure petere potest, sive de quo
actionem habet.
And on the whole matter, if the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy
are Lawful Oaths (as all except Roman Catholicks grant) it must like|wise
be granted, that the Takers of them are indissolubly bound to the ut|termost
of their Power, against all Vsurpers and Vsurpations to defend all
Iurisdictions, c. BELONGING to the King, his Heirs and Succes|sors
as aforesaid: and the very same Arguments that were prevalent with
the Takers of those Oaths formerly not to take the Engagement, nor to
pay Allegiance to the then Vsurpers, do militate, and are very co|gent
and concludent for others who have took those Oaths not to pay it to
any but to the King, and to his Heirs and Successors in the Due and Legal
Course of Descent, and for the defence of all Iurisdictions, c. respective|ly
belonging to them: for according to the words in the forecited Exerci|tation,
The manifest drift of the Oath of Allegiance being the continuance
and assurance of the Crown (upon concession of his then Majesty's just Title)
to his Heirs in Succession after Him and ONE ANOTHER lineally,
and the defence of them therein against all OTHER Corrivals and Oppo|sers,
it is plain that the defeating the Succession in its Due and Legal Course
of Descent in any one Case, will be an Vsurpation not only of the Right
of the Lawful Heir and Successor according to the Proximity of Blood,
but of the Right of the Hereditary Monarchy it self sworn to be defend|ed
as aforesaid. It is therefore no marvel that some of the Learned and
Loyal Writers of the Succession have judged that any such defeating of the
Succession as aforesaid would be Criminal in the same kind as the late Vsur|pation
was.
It may be well supposed that many mens so seldom and so superficially
thinking of those Oaths occasioned their Miscarriages during the former
Rebellion and Vsurpation. Unthinking men generally take those Oaths as
Pills only to be swallowed down, and pro form only, and when gilded over
with an Office of Gain. But to a loyal and rectified mind the frequent
sense of the Moral Offices resulting from those Oaths is as pleasant as any
thing can be to the Taste: and according to that saying in Iob, For the
Ear tryeth words, as the Mouth tasteth meat, a man loyal to the degree
required by those Oaths, will not only nauseate all Principles of Sedition as
rank Poyson, but will be able so critically to try the words in any Sayings
that sound popularly and that are used by Demagogues, as to find out
what in them is wholsome and what poysonous: and accordingly as
for example the excellent Sanderson did in the Maxim of salus populi, su|prema
lex, and did make the salus populi to include that of Kings.
And to this purpose if any will by the Touch-stone of this my 6th Con|clusion
try that Maxim that among all Demagogues so much passeth for
currant Coyn, he will find it not to be Sterling, viz. That People were not
made for their Kings, but their Kings for them: and this saying is partly fa|voured
by what Tully saith in his Offices, viz. Vt tutela, sic procuratio
Reip. ad utilitatem eorum qui commissi sunt, non ad eorum quibus commissa
est, gerenda est. But after any one hath seriously weigh'd this Maxim,
he will find that Kings and their People were made for, and are under na|tural
Obligations to one another, and accordingly as it may be said that

Parents and Children were made for one another and to defend one ano|ther:
and to this purpose the Psalmists words are, Lo Children are an He|ritage
of the Lord, and the Fruit of the Womb is his Reward; as Arrows
are in the hand of a mighty man, so are Children of the Youth; happy is the
man that hath his Quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they
shall speak with the Enemies in the Gate.
But in my further enquiry into the Obligation relating to his Ma|jesty's
Heirs and Successors that results from those Oaths, my 7th
Conclusion shall be, that the Takers of these Oaths are bound thereby
against attempting or endeavouring by any new Law or Constitu|tion
to interrupt the Succession of the Crown in its Due and Legal Course
of Descent.
I do account that the foregoing Conclusion hath cut the Grass under the
Feet of any who have taken those Oaths, and yet would have thus inter|rupted
the Succession, and makes such interruption of its Course not only
unlawful, but to be a nugatory, ridiculous and unaccountable thing.
For since by the known Rights of the Crown, the next Heir to the
Crown is in the next Minute after my King's decease actually King, and
I am necessarily and indispensably bound to pay actual Obedience or Alle|giance
to him then, and have already sworn that I will then expose my lise
in his defence, and the defence of his Crown and Dignity, it is manifest
folly in me to attempt the interrupting the Succession by excluding the
Right Heir, whom I have thus indispensably bound my self to defend, and
to obey, and who perhaps by the Course of Mortality, and Kings who are
nominal Gods coming to die like men, may within a few Minutes after
my having taken the Oaths, be entituled to my born and sworn Allegi|ance.
Dolo facit qui petit id quod mox redditurus est. But, a sorry and
pitiful trick it is and as remote from the subtility of the Serpent as the inno|cence
of the Dove, that any Swearer would put on himself, who attempt|ed
to injure any Prince by going to exclude him from the Allegiance
that he is to pay him perhaps the next Moment.
We are well minded by Sanderson in his second Lecture, That simplicity
becomes an Oath, and that the Swearer is to endeavour to perform what he
hath promised, without fraud, deceit, double dealing or simulation: and he
elsewhere questioning whether the words by my faith are an Oath, saith,
That tho by the Custom of some Countries, or the intention of him who speaks,
they may be an Oath, yet necessarily by virtue of those words an Oath ari|seth
not, but only an asseveration, or an btestation: and he had before
mentioned how Soto did judge the words by my faith to be an Oath: but
the words in faith to be none.
But others have judged that when on the word fides (the which is
justitiae fundamentum) the word CHRISTIAN is built as an Addition,
the compleat Fabrick of an Oath is thereby raised: and with the weight
of those great words before referred to, the Oath of Allegiance concludes,
viz. And I do make this Recognition and Acknowledgment heartily, wil|lingly,
and truly upon the true FAITH of a CHRISTIAN. So help me
God: which sheweth that those words did not casually nor indeed with|out
profound deliberation there come in.
When the true faith or the bona fides of a Roman, did so much scorn to
put a trick upon a Law, doth not the true faith of a Christian more ab|hor
to put one upon an Oath?
I have in my second Conclusion asserted it in general, that the Taker of
all Promissory Oaths is bound to endeavour for the Future, as much as in

him lieth, by his Deeds to fullfil what he hath sworn in words; and here
applying the same particularly to the King's Heirs and Successors, I will
ask if it be congruous to bona fides, i. e. Common honesty, if I am bound by
Law to pay a Debt and have promised and sworn to pay it, for me to en|deavour
by any new Law to evade its payment? I have heard of a Will
made void by Act of Parliament: but after the Executor had sworn to exe|cute
it well and truely, and to pay the Debts and Legacies of the deceased
as far as the Estate extended, could he bon fide and with a Salvo to Con|science,
endeavour to quash it by the Legislative Power?
Nihil ita fidei congruit humanae, qum ea quae placuerant custodii. i. e. No|thing
is so sutable to common honesty, as that those things that have been
once assented to should be observed, is a known saying in the Civil Law;
and so is that of Vlpian in the Digest, Bonae fidei non congruit de apicibus
juris disputare: and it being a Rule of Law there, that Cum quid un vi
prohibetur alicui, ad illud ali vi non debet admitti. i. e. that which can|not
be done one way, or directly, must not be done indirectly or by
another: and it being construed, that whoever acted contrary to this, did
fraudem facere legi, do I to the uttermost of my Power, and on the true faith
of a Christian, defend his Majesty, his HEIRS and SVCCESSORS against
all Attempts which shall be made against his or their Persons, their Crown
and Dignity, and assist and defend all Iurisdictions, Privileges, c. belong|ing
to the King's Highness his HEIRS and SVCCESSORS, if afterward
to the uttermost of my Power I endeavour to dis-inherit the lawful Heir,
and to exclude him from the benefit of his inherent Birth-right by an ex|traordinary
means? Is not the attempt or endeavour to effect this, to be
accounted fraud, according to that Rule of Law, viz. Fraudis interpreta|tio
semper in jure Civili, non ex eventu duntaxat, sed ex consilio quoque desi|deratur:
and which follows after the Rule, viz. Generaliter cum de fraude
disputatur, non quid habeat Actor, sed quid per adversarium habere non po|tuerit,
considerandum est?
'Tis a true old saying, that fallacia pactorum dolum semper habet adjun|ctum:
and omnis calliditas, fallacia, machinatio ad circumveniendum, fal|lendum,
decipiendumve alterum adhibita are made to integrate the defini|tion
of dolus malus by Labeo in the Digest. And is it not a known Rule
among all the Writers of Defence, that Defensio bon fide praestari debet,
and that Promittens aliquid facere, quod contrarium illius non sitfacturus,
promittere censetur, and that defensionem promittens, non tam laesionem illa|tam
avertere quam inferendam praecavere debet? And can I without outra|ging
the true faith of a Christian and the Christian simplicity and sincerity
and singleness of heart, and the Apostles Precept, that no man go beyond and
defraud his Brother, project any Law to exclude those from their Birth|right,
whom I have promised in express words to defend?
When the Morality of Cicero extended to the inclucating it in one of
his Orations, that Est aliquid quod non oporteat, etiamsi licet, and when
he in his Offices renders it to be inhonestum, injuriam alteri non propulsare, and
when the Rules of Law could tell us that Non omne quod licet, honestum est,
and when Seneca could contemn the innocence as poor that was not more
than the Law required, and thereupon say, Quato latis officiorum patet
quam juris Regula? Multa pietas, humanitas, liberalitas, justitia, FIDES
exigunt, quae omnia extra publicas tabulas sunt, and when that St. Paul
hath ennobled the Moral Offices of Christians by enjoyning in his Epistle
to the Philippians, the practice of whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,

whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, c. it
may well be expected that the true faith of a Christian should prevail on
Christians not to attempt the compassing of any thing by a new Law
contrary to what they have by their Oaths promised to defend, and con|trary
to the old Fundamental Laws of the Land.
And having thus far proceeded, my 8th Conclusion shall be, that our Ob|ligation
thus relating both to the King and his Heirs and Successors doth
clearly arise from those Oaths, without any Condition on his or their part
to be performed, and particularly without any respect had to what Re|ligion
they shall profess. We know that Iuramentum limitat praestitum,
limitatum producit consensum  effectum: but 'tis likewise as notorious that
there is nothing of limitation, no IFS or ANDS in these Oaths:
and therefore that known Rule of Non est distinguendum, ubi lex non di|stinguit
must here take place in the Court of Conscience.
Sanderson in his 4th Lecture saith, If two oblige themselves mutually in
promises of different kinds, or not at the same time, or otherwise without
mutual respect, Faith violated by the one, absolveth not the others Obliga|tion,
but each is bound to stand to his Oath, tho the other hath not perform|ed
his part. For example, A King simply and without respect to the Allegi|ance
of his Subjects, sweareth to administer his Government Righteously and ac|cording
to Law. The Subjects at another time simply and without respect to
the Duty of the Prince, swear Allegiance and due Obedience to him. They
are both bound faithfully to perform their several Duties: nor would the
King be absolved from his Oath, if Subjects should not perform their due Obe|dience;
nor Subjects from theirs, tho the King should turn from the Path of
Iustice.
Mr. Ny doth therefore in a printed Treatise of his very well for this
purpose cite Bishop Bilson, and saith, That Bishop Bilson, a great Searcher
into the Doctrine of the Supremacy of Kings, giveth this as the sense of the
Oath, viz. the Oath (as saith the Bishop) expresseth not Kings duty to
God, but ours to them: as they must be obeyed when they joyn with truth, so
must they be endured when they fall into Error. Which side soever
they take, either Obedience to their Wills, or Submission to their Swords is
their due by God's Law. And tho some ill Anti-Papists have ridiculed
Passive Obedience, after they had given the Cautio juratoria against their
owning the Doctrine of Resistance, Mr. Ny, doth very particularly, in
p. 138 of that Book, inveigh against that Doctrine, and saith, Nor if they
were able (i. e. to resist) is it lawful for a Church to compel by the Sword;
more than the Magistrate may by the Keys, or what is peculiar to the Sacred
Function. Uzza erred in the latter; and Peter in the former. The Primi|tive
Rule and Practice was this; Being persecuted in one City to fly into ano|ther,
and pray that their flight may not be in the Winter.
I have read a Manuscript Book of Mr. Ny called, A Discourse of Eccle|siastical
Laws and Supremacy of the Kings of England in dispensing with the
Penalties thereof, where he asserts throughout the Legality of his Maje|stie's
Declaration of Indulgence, and the Book was writ professedly for
that purpose, and he there doth very rationally inculcate the unlawfulness
of Exclusion, as in his other Book he did the unlawfulness of Resistance, and
saith, That Civil Rights and Claims, and Temporal Things, are the immedi|ate
and intrinsic Concern and Interest of all States. Dominium non funda|tur
in grati. The just Claim of a Prince may not be interrupted upon ac|count
he is of this or that Religion or Perswasion. Nor may a Subject be just|ly
banished, imprisoned, confiscated, or ruined on the mere account of Reli|gion,

or because his Conscience is not cast into the same Mould with the
Prince, or present Establishment. It is POPERY to deny Allegiance to a
Prince, or Protection to a Subject upon the account of any such diffe|rence.
It is therefore no wonder that our Ancestors framing the Oath of Al|legiance
would have no Principle of Popery therein favoured by a side
Wind; which according to Mr. Ny's Sense must have happen'd, had
there been any distinguishing reserves, or limitations or restrictions in
the Oath, respecting the Religion of our Princes.
And because many men have been in this Conjuncture of time tempt|ed
to strain their Oaths and their Consciences, by excessive Fears and Jea|lousies
relating to Religion, (and as if God could not Govern the World
but by Princes and their Subjects being of the same Religion) and be|cause
Mr. Ny's judgment is of great Authority among many of our Re|ligionary
Dissenters, I shall here insert somewhat more out of that
Manuscript of his, that falls under this Consideration, and which is in|deed
writ with great Weight and Authority of reason, and worthy the
Writers great Abilities.
He having there put a Question relating to Religion and the Worship
of God being the great Concern of a Nation, and to the trust of dispen|sing
with the Penalties of Ecclesiastical Laws, saith, In answer to it, I
endeavour to unfold, 1. In what sense Religion is the Concern of the
State. 2. The nature of this Trust: and as to the first he saith, The mo|ment
and weight of a matter in our deliberation hath its proportion as either
under an absolute, or respctive Consideration. Wisdom is better than Riches
in it self absolutely: but not in respect to the support of this present life.
The knowledge of God and Divine Things is better than to know the Virtue
of Drugs and Plants; but not in respect to the Study of Physick; so Religion
and the Worship of God is the chiefest and better part in it self considered:
but in its respective Considerations as to the Family of a particular Person
or Community of men for the advancement of Civil Affairs, there are OTHER
qualifications and inducements of greater Consequence, and more directly
and immediately tending to the being or well-being thereof. That there be
no mistake in this great Concernment, I further distinguish: There comes
under the Notion of Religion, the Holyness and Righteousness that is
of the Moral Law, Principles whereof are in all mens natures, and
attended in their actings by a natural Conscience. 3. Gospel Duties di|rected
and ordered by a supernatural Light, no Principles or Footsteps
whereof are found in us. For the former, Religion in the first sense,
as the knowledge of God, Conscience of an Oath, Iustice, Righteous|ness
in our dealings, c. are such things wherein the well-being of King|doms
and Commonwealths is much concern'd. But Religion as it stands in
exerting supernatural Principles, and in Duties termed the Commands of
Christ (as the other the Commandments of God, Jo. 15.) Such as Faith,
Repentance, Sacraments, Discipline, and the like Gospel Ordinances; in
the Duties under this Head considered and as distinct from Moral Du|ties,
there is little or nothing directly and immediately contributed by them
to Mens civil interests, further than where these supernatural Vertues are
planted in Mens minds, the Moral Duties of Piety and Honesty do more
plentifully abound and are in exercise. As these Moral Duties do more im|mediately
concern the Common-wealth, so the Laws thereof are principally
drawn forth out of them, especially the second Table Duties, forming and build|ing
them into Municipal Laws under Penalties and Encouragements greater

or less, as in the Wisdom of a State is judged most conducing to the
Well-fare thereof. For these Gospel-mysteries it is otherwise. For as they
contribute to us in our Civil Government no otherwise than as before mention|ed,
so is there little contributed by the Wisdom or Authority of any State,
advantageous to the Gospel, but Protection, or being a defence upon the glory
of it. If Adam had stood all Common-wealths, had been prosperous and
flourishing, and yet no Faith, no Christ, no Repentance, nor any Gospel-Worship
known or professed. And since the fall, you have had well govern'd
Kingdoms among Heathens and Turks that never received Christ or Gospel-Worship.
It is with States as with particular Persons in Commerce: ano|ther
mans Estate or Trade or Credit or any other Civil Concern with whom
I have to do, is not prejudiced or better'd by Omission or Practice of what is
a mere Gospel Duty. If a man I deal with be unjust, lye, steal, c. my
worldly Interest is prejudiced hereby: but whether he repent, or exercise
faith in Christ for forgiveness of Sins, and humble himself, I am neither
gainer nor loser in my Civil Concerns. Now it is Gospel-Worship, Gospel-Religion
we profess in this Nation, c.
The Christian Religion having suffered so much by so many Pedantly
and Bigottish Writers having mis-represented it as an Invader both of the
quiet and business of Princes and Governors, and as if the necessary dif|ferent
Sentiments in Religion according to mens several Capacities, were
still to give the Political Conduct of the World unnecessary trouble,
and as if God who was in Christ reconciling the World to himself, design'd
by any various Religionary Notions to render Christian Princes and
their People irreconcileable to one another, and ( I may say) to make
the World irreconcileable to it self, I am glad when I find the Subject of
Religion by falling into the hands of any man of large and noble thoughts,
to have right herein done it, as particularly hath thus been done it by
Mr. Ny, who had made Religion and Politicks very much his Study:
and I can refer the Curious to a Great Man of the Communion of the
Church of Rome, with some of whose Notions in this Point Mr. Ny's
were partly Co-incident, as any may find who will consult the 2d Vo|lume
of the Memoires of Villeroy, whose great Character is Recorded by
the Bishop of Rhodes in his History of Harry the 4th of France, and to
whom he was Secretary, and was so before to Charles the 9th and Harry
the 3d, and afterward to Lewis the 13th, and the greatest part of D'Ossat's
memorable printed Letters from Rome was to him with high respect
Addressed. In the beginning of that Volume we have his Discours de la
vraye  legitime constitution de l' estat,  que l' ordre y est, encore que la
Religion n' y fust: and in p. 6, he discourseth of this Subject, viz. L'
estat,  la Religion n' ont rien de Commun: and in p. 11. there his Subject is,
That l' estat n' est estably ny mainteny par la Religion, ains la Religion con|serve
par l' estat: and in p. 16. his Theme is, That la difference de Reli|gion
n' empesche point la paix de l' estat: and in p. 19. he discourseth of
this Assertion, That Le Prince ne doit etre consider pour sa Religion, mais
pour ce qu'il est chef du peuple.
It may moreover be supposed that God in his Government of the
World, and in his care for the Church in particular Countries, when he
thinks not fit to incline a Princes mind to receive the same Religionary
Sentiments that the generality of the People owns, doth yet often endow
him with those Moral Vertues and habitual inclinations whereby he is
much better qualified for the Protection of the People than any can ima|gine
him to be by Orthodoxy in the Speculative points of revealed Truth.

The Church we know is in Scripture represented as a helpless Minor,
and Kings are there mentioned to be its Nursing Fathers: and thus the
Canon Law tells us, that Ecclesia fungitur vice minoris, and the Canonists,
that  minoribus ad Ecclesiam valet argumentum. It is here therefore ob|vious
to consideration that Power and moral Honesty and Diligence
and Courage and Discretion are the chief endowments requisite for the
protection of an Orphans Person and Estate. We find these sayings com|monly
used by the Roman Catholick Authors who treat of the Rights of
Protection granted by Sovereign Powers, viz. Religio cum protectionis jure
nihil commune habet: and Religionis communio propri nulla homini cum
homine, sed homini cum Deo: and Religioni cum juribus Gentium nulla est
necessaria conjunctio: and on these grounds Magers in his 8th Chapter of
his Advocatia armata, raising the Question whether Roman Catholick and
Luther an and Calvinist Princes may lawfully protect and defend one another,
determines that they may; and that they ought so to do, pursuant
to the agreements of the Interim and other pacta Conventa: and in his
1th Chapter he refers to the settlement of the Confraternities in Germany
between Princes of several Religions, and particularly of that settled be|tween
the Dukes of Bavaria and the Count Palatines of the Rhine, Tam
quoad bonorum  principatuum, qum dignitatis Electoralis successionem,
and which was not to be dissolved by either of those Electors changing
their Relgion. And the same reasons are assign'd by him and other
Writers of the jus Protectitium for the lawfulness of Christian Princes pro|tecting
Iews, Turks, and Infidels: and it passeth among them as the
common opinion of the Canonists and Civilians, Infidelitatem non priva|re
quemjure naturali, dominiove rerum aut provinciarum.
And as I have already referred to the Instance of Abraham in obliging
himself at once to Abimelech and his Son, and his Sons Son; I shall here
cast my Eye on Abimelech as an Idolater, and take notice that the afore|sa
Father of the Faithful, and by whose Bosom Heaven is represented,
and who had the honour done him by Holy Writ, to be called the friend of
God, and by the Chronological Writers of Memorable Things to be called
Inventor foederum, (and most worthy of him, as being the friend of God,
it was, to be the Inventor of Alliances and federal friendship with men)
did make that first Alliance with an idolatrous Prince and with his whole
Race of Idolaters in Prospect.
If then it is an allowed judged point by the consent of Parties, That
Religion is out of the Case when one Prince doth freely protect another,
and his Subjects of different Religions, it may be thence very well inferr'd,
That it is most reasonable and just, and ought not to any to seem strange
that Subjects, who owe a natural Allegiance to their Princes, are indispen|sably
bound to pay the same to them, and to defend all their Regal
Rights without any regard to the Religion their Princes may profess: and
on the other hand that Princes may oft protect their Subjects who differ
in Religion from them, in the enjoyment of their Rights.
I grant that some Popish Princes abroad having rivetted the Inquisition
into their Politicks, and being perhaps of harsh or bigotted dispositions,
have out of a regret against Hereticks expelled Infidels from their Ter|ritories,
and by which expulsion such Princes have been sufficient losers
in this World: and a Case of which nature is particularly referred to by
the Bishop of Rhodes in his History of Harry the 4th of France, who ac|counting
the Moors in Spain to be about a Million, mentions the hard
usage they there found, and that before they were thence expulsed they

applied to Harry the 4th for Protection, once when but King of Na|varre,
and afterward when King of France and a Roman Catholick, and
who then did no more doubt of the lawfulness of protecting them, than
while he was a Protestant, however he forbore on Political grounds only
to protect and defend them. Nor when he forsook the Communion of
the Protestant Church were any of his Heretical Subjects used by him
with any hardship on the account of the hard word of Heresy: and I be|lieve
his Notion of the practicableness of an orderly Political Govern|ment
without reference to Religionary differences, was the same with
his great Minister Villeroy's.
I have mentioned how Cardinal D' Ossat told the Pope, that if his
Holyness were King of France at that time that Harry the 4th was, he
would shew the Huguenots the same favour that Harry the 4th did; and
shall observe it that in the famous printed Oration of Cardinal Perron,
made to the 3d Estate, or Commonalty of France, tho he speaks of the
LATERAN Council, and owns and asserts it to be a general one as stre|nuously
as the Learned Bishop of Lincoln hath since done, and faith,
When that Council intended to provide for the extirpation and rooting out of
the Reliques of the Albigenses, it ordained that the Princes who should be|come
Contemners of the Council that Condemned the Albigenses, should be
deprived of the Obligation of their Subjects fidelity to them: yet he then adds,
And this I remember not for an Example to disturb or trouble the publick
Peace or Tranquillity, seeing the Hereticks are here in so great a number as
that they make a notable part of the Body of the Estate, c.
Here then I have named two Cardinals of as great real Eminence as any
the Church of Rome could ever shew, who held it lawful for a Ca|tholick
Prince to protect his Protestant Subjects, notwithstanding the
Lateran Council.
But what Tacitus speaks of the Duty of common Men, namely, that
they should not penetrate Abditos Principis sensus, nay, be particularly
applied to their Religion. And the Apostles Caution of Who art thou that
judgest another mans servant, may here be improved by saying, Who art
thou that judgest thy Natural Liege Lord, and particularly as to matters
of Religion, wherein the most Antimonarchical Writers will allow them
accountable only to God. And to any Protestant who having followed
his judgment of Discretion, hath separated from the Communion of ano|ther
Church, and yet shall Censure his Prince for so doing, those other
words of the Apostle are justly applicable, Therefore thou art inexcusable
O man whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another thou
condemnest thy self: for thou that judgest doest the same things.
The Christian Religion that hath enjoyned us not only to defraud and
injure, and offend none, and to love our Neighbour as our self, and extended
that Neighbourhood to all Humane kind, hath likewise commanded us to
HONOVR all men, and especially to render honour to whom honour is parti|cularly
due, and not rashly to judge another: and if men would imprint
on their minds a serious Sense of the Moral Offices to which they are
obliged by Virtue of those Expressions, they would soon be better guided
in the Measures of their Obligations relating to the King and his Heirs
and Successors without being tempted as formerly to exclude any of them
from their Civil Rights on the account of Religion.
Ames in his Cases of Conscience doth well descant on those Moral Offi|ces:
and in his Chapter of Charity to our Neighbour, he assigns some parti|cular
Cases, in which, as to the actual exercise and effect of Charity, one is to

love, his Neighbour more than himself, and instanceth in our being in Tem|poral
Matters obliged to prefer publick Persons to our selves, and saith,
That all are to be reckoned among publick Persons concerning whom it is ma|nifest
that they are useful to the Realm: and in the Case of whom he
determines it, That on their occasionally being in danger of their lives, we
are to venture ours.
Are we not then, when we may without the peril of our lives defend
the Civil Rights of an Heir of the Crown, who by the venturing his
life hath supported the honour of the Realm, obliged to forbear excluding
him from the benefit of his Birth-right? The Privilege of his owning
the belief of Religionary Propositions, tho differing from any other
mens, was purchased for him by the Blood of Christ, and in using it, he
doth but use his own Right, and consequently injures no man: and if we
slight the offering his own blood to us, shall we too vilify, or (as I
may say) endeavour to nullify in his Case the effect of the Blood of his
Saviour?
Ames in his Chapter De honore proximi tells us, That Honour, accord|ing
to the common Notion of it, doth denote the Testification of the excellence
and worth of any one: and that such Testification thereof cannot appear be|fore
men but by Words and Actions: and that it likewise includes a congruous
judgment and internal affection, in the which there is a kind of inward testi|fying
before God: and therefore the solid Office of HONOVRING doth chief|ly
depend on the inward acknowledgment of any ones worth or excellence.
And afterward referring to the express Command in St. Peter of honour|ing
all men, he saith, Vix quisquam reperitur in quo non possimus aliquid ob|servare
in quo nobis est superior, si ex humilitate judicium feramus. Phil. 2. 3.
and then speaking of impious men, saith, Quatenus boni aliquid habent,
justum ejus testimonium non est ipsis denegandum. He afterward in his
Chapter concerning rash judgment, shewing that it is a Sin and how, saith,
1. 'Tis a Sin of Levity against Prudence. 2. 'Tis contrary to the Princi|ples
of Nature, Quod tibi non vis fieri, c. for no man is willing that his
Neighbour should judge rashly of him and his Actions. 3. It diminisheth
the good of ones Neighbour, and opposeth his Right: for that every man
hath as much right to his good Fame, as to a depositum in any mens hands,
till he himself has by his actings took it away. 4. It begets contempt of
ones Neighbour, Rom. 14. 3. 10. by which means it happens that he is
held unworthy of beneficial employments. 5. 'Tis an Vsurpation of the judg|ment
and Authority of God, who judgeth of hidden things: and in that Chap|ter
raising the Question, Whether and how doubtful matters are to be in|terpreted
in the better part? he answers, 1. That what is doubtful as to
things, ought to be weighed according to reason, without inclining to either
part. 2. That what is doubtful as to Persons, wherein their good or ill re|pute
is concerned, is absolutely to be interpreted in the better part. 1 Cor.
3. 5. and that at least in such a Case we are not to judge ill of our Neighbour:
and further, That we are so in common Offices or Duties to demean our selves
to him, as if he were an upright man, since the contrary doth not appear to
us. This is the judgment of Charity. And in his Chapter De exemplo
bono  scandalo, he saith, That there must of necessity be Sin in every Scan|dal,
because the ruine or Spiritual detriment of ones Neighbour is therein
concerned. He there moreover doth inculcate one great point of Morali|ty
in order to the avoiding of Scandal, and saith, Damnanda  horrenda
est illa perversitas judicii qua solent multi quorundam labentium Casu aut hy|pocriseos
detectione, alios professionem similem facientes, hypocritas idcirco

pronunciare. Hoc est enim plan Diabolum imitari in piis accusandis  ini|qu
suspicione gravandis, Job 1. 11.
And having said all this, may I not ask if he honoureth his Prince who
doth not think him wise enough to choose his Religion? When the fate
of our Princes is usually to fix their Marriages with Relation to the well|fare
of the State, and when their Favourites are so seldom permitted by
the Populace to lie quiet in their Bosoms, and that 'tis a Princes Lot
thus not to be like others, able to choose his Wife or his Friend,
shall he not choose his God? since that Verse in Phil. 2d referred to,
saith, In lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves;
doth he observe that Precept who esteems not his Prince as fit to be
trusted with the freedom of choosing his way to Heaven, and the judg|ment
of discretion as himself? since there are many qualifications of Ex|cellence
for the discharge of the Regal Office, that claim preference of a
Princes Orthodoxy in the belief of the Mysteries of the Gospel, doth he
honour all men, and particularly, give honour to whom honour is due, who
when he sees the whole World agreed in the Fact of his Princes Heir
being most signally, perhaps beyond any one of the Age, blest with those
qualifications, shall instead of testifying by words and actions such his Ex|cellence
and intrinsic worth (and wherewith God hath honoured him) try to
exclude him from the Throne? A Great Philosopher of our Nation,
and one who hath writ Philosophically of the Passions, tells us, That
the value or worth of a man is, as of all other things, his price, that is to say,
so much as would be given for the use of his Power, and therefore is not ab|solute
but a thing dependant on the need and judgment of another: and then
tells us, That an able Conductor of Souldies is of great price in time of
War present or imminent. And any one that will consider what the pre|sent
War-like State of the World abroad is, and that by necessity of Na|ture
in the growing populous World we must expect the peremptory
noise of Wars and Rumours of Wars, to be more and more calling on our
attention, will probably be of opinion that the High-born Lawful
Princes of great Martial Talents will be the best Heirs and Successors
Heaven can send any Countries. That Author somewhat suitably to
Ames his Notion of Honouring, saith, The manifestation of the value we
set on one another, is that which is commonly called honouring and dishonour|ing.
To value a man at a high rate is to honour him: at a low rate is to
dishonour him.
And I may add that an heroical Habit of Courage in any Prince is
the more valuable or intituled to honour, because it is by necessity of Na|ture
accompanied with the highest Clemency and gentleness, it being
the excessive fear of danger that puts Cowardice on Cruelty.
The Author I refer to says likewise, That to be descended from Conspi|cuous
Parents is honourable, because they more easily attain the Aids and
Friends of their Ancestors. On the contrary to be descended from obscure
Parentage is dishonourable. With how great an honour then and reveren|tial
awe ought we to think of the great Claim of Birth-right, the next
Heir of the Crown hath, which may be lineally and successively deri|ved
from the British, Scotish, Danish, Saxon, and Norman Princes above
two thousand years, which is more ancient than any Prince in the World
can shew? and when God who finished his Work-man-ship of the World in
Six days, hath been two thousand years in making up the Hereditary
Glories of this Line, can we without horror think of any ones dishonour|ing
it, by breaking in on its Succession under pretences of Religion

or honouring God? when so many Fountains of Royal Blood have
been filling this Sea of Honour two thousand years, will a few men by
their poor Sculls project to empty it, or with the Breath of Sophisms
to turn the Great Purple Tide that hath born down the World before it
so many years?
But it is not only the thought of the Aides that the next Heir of the
Crown may have from the Friends of his Ancestors, that may make
his Descent from Conspicuous Parents so justly to be honoured, as was said,
but the sight of all the Lines of the Great and Honourable Actions of his
numerous Ancestors, being made by the hand of Heaven to point at him
as the Centre, and their being fixt so in his Memory that we cannot well
think of his thinking of any thing but Honour, that must make other
Subjects pay the greater Veneration of his High Birth.
It is so hard a matter even for the flights of imagination with the
exquisiteness of Art to produce thoughts of Kings and Princes any way
proportionable to their real Figure, that I have observed that our old
famous Dramatists of the former Ages could hardly in any Scene give
us the Character of a King done up to the height of a Monarchs Glory:
and as the Characters of Kings in those days were expressed, it was but
necessary that the Rule in Theaters should be, that the Kings should en|ter
there with loud Musick that so their Quality might that way be under|stood.
It is then no marvel if so many in the present Age who are not made
 meliore luto, and whose Education was low, and whose Souls are narrow,
cannot comprehend the honour of the great part that God calls Kings
to Act on the Stage of the World, and are especially Strangers to the
great thoughts that are to be supposed to Crown the Souls of Kings
when they espouse a Religion.
But in that great particular Concern of Princes owning their Religi|on,
we are morally bound to think of them with all the honour we can:
nor to repine at that our Duty to them, since in the Concern of Religion,
and as it is a Principle of the Divine Life we are to honour our Inferiours,
and cannot without profanation and usurping on Gods Right judge them
rashly.
We are not to think that our honouring all men, and the necessary parts
of that duty are recommended to us by way of Council in order to a more
perfect life, and as not sub peccato obliging any but those who have by Vow
bound themselves to the practice of the same: but we are to esteem them
Precepts, and properly so called, and universally binding, and as necessa|ry
parts of that Holiness without which no man can see God. And therefore
when I see any man after much labouring of his thoughts to have chang|ed
the Profession of his Belief of any Tenets controverted among Chri|stians,
and particularly one who was in the Communion of the Church
of England to own the belief of Transubstantiation, Purgatory, and the
Doctrine of Iustification according to the Sense of the Council of Trent,
or other such points, and shall find that most certainly that it neither was
nor could be for Gain or respect to Temporal advantages that his
judgment appeared thus altered, nor yet out of levity and natural in|constancy,
and that his habitual constancy and steadiness in all measures
relating to Persons and things long by me observed, have assured me that
no such change could thence proceed, and shall further observe in such
Person a greater tenderness in his regard to second Table Duties than be|fore,
and that his inclinations of Beneficence to all Mankind, and parti|cularly

to his former friends now differing in judgment from him, have
not been tinctured and discoloured by any alteration of his Notions, I
shall think my self under various Moral Obligations to honour such a
Person, tho perhaps erroneously opining. I will honour him for his
discharge of his Duty in trying all things, and having spent time in exa|mining
the truth of Religionary Speculations, and taking up a Religion
not by chance (as most Orthodox Religionaries do) but by choice. I
will honour him for following that which Sanderson in his Lectures of
Conscience calls the next and immediate (tho not the adequate) Rule of
his Conscience, the light of his mind for the time present, a Light that I
see so many Orthodox Religionaries playing with or endeavouring to
extinguish. I will honour him for the great Sacrifice I think that he ho|nestly
intends to truth, (and to offer which to it I see so many Persons
who erred, so reluctantly brought to its Altars) I mean the Pride and
Glory of the Humane understanding by a Recantation of its former
Sentiments, a Sacrifice that to him, who consults with Flesh and Blood,
may seem as unpleasant, as the offering up of Isaac did to Abraham. And
since to presage well of men is to honour them, I will thus in the Case of
such a Person, who hath thus honoured God by taking up his ross and ta|king
shame to himself, believe that God will honour him, and judge, that
tho he may in statu viatoris have mistaken Error for Truth in his way, he
will not mistake Hell for Heaven at his Journeys end. Moreover since
to speak rashly to or of any men is a dishonour to them, I will not only not
dishonour such a Person by determining that his Error is voluntary (which
whether it be so I can never know, and which if it be not, I do know it
can be no Sin) but will pay him the just honour of my judging it to be
involuntary; as knowing that neither he nor any one else can com|mand
his own understanding, and that the nature of the understanding
is such that it can no more apprehend things otherwise than they appear
to it, than the Eye see other Colours in the Rain-bow than it doth, whe|ther
those Colours be really there or no. Moreover altho I know that
no Law binds without a Promulgation, and that that Promulgation of Di|vine
positive Laws may by reason of mens diffent Abilities of understand|ing
be sufficient for one man that is not for another, (and so that the er|roneous
opinion of one man may be a Crime, and another mans holding
the me opinion may be innocent) yet I will not dishonour the under|standing
of any man for his not believing the Controverted points of
Christian Religion, that I observe other men of great intellectuals pro|fess
the Belief of: and do consider, that as the Wind bloweth where it lists,
so the influx of the Divine Spirit on men is not confined to the excellence
of their understandings, and that God doth not always reveal his mind
to men according to the Proportion of their Gifts and Graces, and that
when the Book of the Law was found and read before Iosiah, Hulda the
Prophetess was sent to and consulted, tho there were Prophets in the
Land at that time: and that that was Revealed sometime to Nathan,
that was not to David, who was in all points his Superior. I will ac|cording
to what was cited out of Ames, Interpret every thing of him in
the better part that is doubtful. And tho men do naturally think them|selves
equally wise, I will, according to the Morality enjoyned by that
place in the Philippians, Esteem him better than my self: since a great
part of Wisdom consists in the proportioning of the means to the end, I
will out of the knowledge of my own frequent Omissions in that kind,
account that we both having designed the same end of Eternal Happiness,

he tho differing from me in speculative points, yet hath by his Practical
Devotion proportioned his means to that end better than I have done.
Moreover because it is a dishonourable thing for any man to receive a Re|ligion
in gross, and servilely to own all the Religionary Sentiments that
the Major part of any Church seem to do, I will not so much as in my
secret thoughts charge such a Person with owning all the Religionary Te|nets
of the Church of Rome, and much less with owning any one of the
Tenets that is Irreligionary, how justly soever chargeable either on the
Papacy or any of its Adherents.
I who am a Son of the Church of England, have considered how its
Constitution hath been prop'd up in various ways, and on different Hypo|theses
by several of the Fathers and great Writers in that Church before
Arch-Bishop Laud's time and since, and how some of them in some points
receded from its Articles, and that many of them did in several Do|ctrines
of importance variously interpret its Articles. My Conversation
with several Divines of that Church who are equally Learned and Pious,
hath let me see that in many Theological speculative points they differ
much from one another, and yet retain perfect Charity for one another;
and their Notions as to which points they have in prudence not troubled
the Populace with. And yet even in our very Protestant Populace in this
Conjuncture of Zeal against Popery, I have observed so much Candour ex|pressed
to Protestant Writers who have asserted some speculative points
that seemed to agree with the Doctrines of the Church of Rome, that no
one man hath either called them Papists, or Protestants in Masquerade
for so doing.
I have not heard of any who hath censured Mr. Baxter as a Papist or
Popishly affected, since Dr. Tully in his printed Letter to him, p. 21.
desiring him to take his Balance and weigh more diligently, that he might
see the very small odds, between His Iustification and the Council of Trents,
addeth, for to me neither of them turns the Scale upon the other. There
was likewise after the beginning of the Popular Out-cryes of the Danger
of Popery a Learned Metrophysical Book of Dr. Glisson (who was Professor
of Physick in Cambridge, and Fellow of the Royal Society) Printed and
Dedicated to the EARL of SHAFTSBVRY, and in the 28th
Chapter there, viz. De substantiarum penetrabilitate mutat quantitate,
the Dr. saith, That 'tis better to admit Penetration, than a Vacuum, how|ever
we have been taught from our Child-hood to believe that there is no pe|netration
of Bodies and Dimensions, and doth Combat those old Notions of
Philosophy with which Transubstantiation was opposed formerly; and yet
was never censured so much as Popishly affected for so writing; nor have I
observed any one to blame him for it, or to have animadverted on his
Book. I have likewise observed that several Protestant Divines have not
been in the least reproached or censured as maintainers of Purgatory,
when they have professed their Beliefs that the Souls of good Men after
Death go to a good Hades, and of bad Men to a bad one, and are to
stay in those common receptacles till the day of Judgment. It is
hence obvious that there are ingenious Protestants who do not take up
their Religion in gross, and that the fear of Popery or hatred of it is not
generally so much founded on the Speculative Religionary Propositions
maintained by Papists, as partly on the Arbitrary Power claimed by
the Pope to impose Creeds on men, and by which Power he may if he
pleaseth command them to believe that there are no Antipodes, and ex|communicate
any who believe there are, as one Pope long since did, and

partly on his claiming a Power to disturb the measures of their Loyalty
to their Princes.
In such a Conjuncture therefore as this, when 'tis so much out of fashion
to think any one the less a Christian, or the less a Protestant for differing
from others of the Church of England, in such point as aforesaid, it would
be an aggravation of the immorality of our not acknowledging the ho|nour
due to any Person of the Roman-Catholick Communion, because
supposed to own Speculative Religionary Tenets of this Nature, and
which too have no influence no Mens Conversation with each other, or
on their Actions as they are Members of any Civil Society, and (as
one saith) would be still the same with all the Consequences of them, tho
there were no other Person besides one's self in the World. And therefore as
I will rashly charge no Protestant with the servile resignation of his rea|son
to any true Church, nor look on him as one who doth, More balan|tium
antecedentem Ducem sequi, so I will not without just ground and cer|tain
proof charge any Papist with the taking up his Religion in gross
from the Papal Chair, nor with the owning all the Religionary Tenets
that many Romanists do, and much less with any one of the Irreli|gionary
Tenets imputable to any Order of the Church of Rome, or to the
Papacy. To think any Papist the less a Christian for owning such Tenets
which being held by some Protestants, we think them not the less Chri|stians
for, doth most notoriously come under the Sin of Acceptio persona|rum,
and is contrary to that Precept of St. Iames, viz. My Brethren, have
not the faith of our Lord Iesus Christ the Lord of Glory with respect of Per|sons:
and by which accepting of some mens Persons the duty of honouring
all men, and valuing their real worth is manifestly outraged.
I will by no means therefore rashly charge any particular Papist with
owning the Tenet, that he is implicitly to obey the Commands of the
Pope without weighing the Justice of them: for I find the contrary Te|net
own'd in print by the seven Divines of Venice, as Ames mentions it
in the Preface to his Puritanismus Anglicanus, where he saith, In Tractatu
illo Iudiciosissimo  septem Theologis (meaning those of Venice) de inter|dicto
Papae conscripto, verbatim ponitur  nervos firmatur haec propositio,
viz. Christianus praecepto sibi facto etiam  Pontifice summo, obedientiam prae|stare
non debet, nisi prius praeceptum examinaverit, quantam materia subje|cta
requirit, an sit conveniens, legitimum  obligatorium:  is qui sie
illo examine praecepti sibi injuncti, caeco quodam impetu obedit, peccat.
And do not many of the Church of Rome by their being picque'z d' hon|neur
upon the being called Papists, give some indication thereby of their
being not obliged to pay an absolute blind Obedience to the Pope? And
tho Bellarmine and several of the Popes Parasites have called those Here|ticks,
that believe not the Iure-Divinity of the Popes Monarchy over the
World, yet all the Gibelline Papists of old made it HERESY to say that
the Emperor was not by Divine Right Lord of the World. Moreover
tho some Papists have writ opprobriously of the Scripture, and called it as
well as made it a Nose of Wax, yet is the reverence of others of that
Church for those inspired Writings sufficiently known, and as may ap|pear
by that great saying of Panormitn so often cited by the Protestant
Writers, viz. Laico verum dicenti cum Evangelio, magis credendum, quam
Concilio falsum dicenti contra Evangelium. It is so easie a thing for every
man of ordinary reading and observation to expatiate on the common
place of the disagreements of the Writers of the Church of Rome, in various
important Religionary Doctrines, that I need not here do it.

'Tis a common Observation that in Spain and Italy it is the common
opinion that Latreia is due to the Cross, which in France and Germany
is not so: and that at Rome no man may say that the Council is above the
Pope, nor at Paris that the Pope is above the Council: and as to the
great Doctrine of Iustification, every one hath heard of Bellarmin's Tutissi|mum,
and of Stephen Gardners laying his dead grasp on Christ's Merits
as he was sinking: and as to some Papists not believing the School Conclu|sions
in that Church, there is a famous instance cited by Crackanthorp in his
Logick, concerning a great Roman Catholick Writer, who said, Sic dicerem
in scholis: sed tamen (maneat inter nos) diversum sentio. Sic dicimus
in scholis: sed tamen (maneat inter nos) non potest probari ex sacris li|teris.
And therefore (since as was said) every man hath a right to his good
name till he hath justly forfeited it, I will honour such a Roman Catholick as
before described, with the reputation of his being a good Christian, and shall
think that I am Morally bound to esteem all Papists so qualified to be bet|ter
Christians than any Orthodox Protestants that want those Moral En|dowments:
and according to my Obligation to honour all men and love the
Brotherhood, and consequently to be readier to do good Caeteris paribus to
Christians than to those who are strangers to Christianity, will thus love
such a Papist as a part of that Brotherhood, and by our Saviours measures in
those words of the same being his Brother, Sister and Mother whosever
shall do the will of God, will take notice of and honour, and love
such a Roman Catholick as much as if the closest Iura sanguinis united
me to him, and with respect to not only the ONE Blood that all Nati|ons
were made of, but the ONE Blood they were redeemed with, and by
virtue of those other words of our Saviour, viz. That if any man will do
his Will, he shall know of the Doctrine, c. will account that in points
necessary and essential to such a mans salvation, our blessed Lord hath been
as ready to make his Doctrine known to him, as effectually as he could be
supposed to make it known to such near Relations.
They are expressions worthy of a Divine of the Church of England,
in an excellent Sermon that goeth under the name of Dr. Tillotson, viz.
I had rather perswade any one to be a good man, than to be of any party or
denomination of Christians whatsoever. For I doubt not but the belief of the
ancient Creed without the addition of any other Articles, together with a
good life will certainly save a man. And since Iustin Martyr when Try|pho
the Iew demanded his thoughts of the Salvation of the Iews then
living, and expected that he would pronounce them damned, the Martyr
answered, That he hoped they might be saved if with their Ceremonials
they did also observe ; i. e. The E|ternal
and Natural Rules of indispensable Holyness: and since he notwith|standing
the barbarous uncharitableness of the stiff-necked and narrow
souled Iews, who would not shew a Traveller the way that was not of
their Religion, did yet shew the invincible Charity of a Christian to
them being ready (as he saith) , i. e. To receive them friendly and to communi|cate
all things to them as BRETHREN or affectionate friends, it may
well be esteemed an uncouth sight see some peevish Nominal Protestants,
who observe none of those Rules, yet to exclude Papists out of the Christian
Brotherhood, and even to damn them who with the Ceremonies of the
Church of Rome, do most religiously observe those Great and Noble
Rules

And therefore tho the reconciling of Churches is by some good men
hoped for, and by all good men wished, yet since it can by no rational
men be supposed possible without a previous reconciliation of Persons
first had, and that this latter is no Project but a Moral Duty and Vital
part of Christianity, and that 'tis an empty Project for any one to think
to deserve the name of a Christian without being reconciled to the whole
Creation of God, and being first reconciled to his Brother as the Expres|sion
is in St. Matthew, I shall with that this Duty of honouring all men, and
as inclusive of our internal affection and testifying before God the worth and
excellence that is in any Roman Catholicks, and of the interpreting all
doubtful matters relating to them in the better part, (as was before ex|plicated
out of Ames) may more and more be thought of by Prote|stants
as Essential to their Christianity.
Any one who will consider that Canon of our Church, viz. It was far
from the purpose of the Church of England to forsake and reject the Churches
of Italy, France, Spain, and Germany, or any such like Churches in all things
that they held and practised, c. that it only departed from them in those
particular points wherein they were fallen, both from themselves in their an|cient
integrity, and from the Apostolical Churches which were their first Foun|ders,
may see the great perfection of the Principles of the Church of Eng|land
in honouring all men, and loving the whole Brotherhood of Christianity:
and our Duty wherein as necessary to Salvation is very excellently incul|cated
by a great Father of that Church, I mean, My Lord Primate Bram|hal
in his just Vindication of the Church of England p. 15. where having
said, That the Communion of the Christian Church Catholick is partly in|ternal,
partly external, and made it part of this Internal Communion, to
udge charitably one of another, to exclude none from the Catholick Com|munion,
either Eastern or Western, Southern or Northern Christians, c.
to rejoyce at their well-doing, to sorrow for their Sins, to condole with them
in their sufferings, to pray for their constant perseverance in the true Christian
Faith, for their reduction from all their respective Errors, and their re-union
to the Church in Case they be divided from it, c. and lastly to hold an actu|al
external Communion with them in votis, in our desires, and to endeavour
it by all those means that are in our Power, he tells us in plain terms that
this internal Communion is of absolute necessity among all Catholicks. And in
p. 26th he declareth to the same purpose, That internal Communion is due
always from all Christians to all Christians, even to those with whom we can|not
communicate externally in many things, whether Opinions or Practices.
But external Communion may sometimes be suspended more or less, c. and
he doth afterward in p. 18 assert, That Christian Communion implies not an
Vnity in all Opinions: and shews, That the Roman and African Churches
held good Communion one with another, while they differ'd both in Iudgment
and Practice about Rebaptisation.
As for any projected Universal Vnity of Opinions, I look on it to be
as impracticable as our levelling Republicans EQVAL Division of Lands
in the late times by their wild Agrarian Laws: for the Birth of the next
Child would necessarily break that their Model, and the same fate might
be expected to happen the same way to this Model of Vnity of Opinions,
or perhaps by the birth of the next hour. But this Internal Communion
is a thing most possible, and our Duty tho without hope of Unity in all
Religionary Opinions to ensue thereby, according to the Doctrine of this
Great Primate.

If then we are Morally bound to have this Internal Communion with
all Foreign Roman Catholick Princes and their Subjects, as before descri|bed,
how can we without horror think of the excluding any Heir to
the Crown (for fear of his believing the same Religionary Notions that
they do) from the Catholick Communion, and of excluding him from his
Birth-right on such an account whom we must always have this Internal
Communion with, and rejoyce in his good successes, and condole with him in
his ill, and to hold an external Communion with him and any Church he is of, in
votis, in our desires, and to endeavour it by all means that are in our Power?
Did any endeavour it, who would by depriving him of his Birth-right on
that account, and holding the same Tenet with Papists of Dominium fun|datur
in grati, gave him such a just Cause of Scandal, as without the Di|vine
Spirit assisting him, might endanger his withdrawing from the
whole Christian Communion: And tho the honest Heathen could tell us,
That Cavendum est ne poena major sit quam culpa, and all Casuists agree, That
Poena non debet excedere delictum, and tho Magna Charta tell us, That
Ex quantitate poenae cognoscitur quantitas delicti, quia poena debet esse commen|surabilis
delicto, yet attempted to punish him by the loss of his Birth-right
of the Crown, when it could not be certain to us that he had committed
any fault at all, and when by the judgment of Charity we were bound to
believe that he had committed none?
To many of our Nominal Protestants, whose thoughts and Ideas of
Christian Communion are too narrow to extend not only to a National
Church, but to a Parochial one, this Notion of the incomparable Pri|mate
(for whose august Charity one Christian World of Religionary
differences was not enough to overcome) about internal Communion,
will I believe seem new Doctrine and Duras Sermo; but if they would
be true Christians instead of being called true Protestants, this Duty of
Internal Communion from all Christians to all Christians, must be pra|ctised
by them: and if this Duty hath a Divine Right for it as to the
Persons of Papists abroad, it must be operative as to those here at home.
He who loveth not his Brother whom he hath seen, I may ask, how can he
love either his God, or his Brother that he hath not seen? The sham-war
among any Protestants and Papists must not only be lest off, but they
must honour the Persons of one another: and Protestants are not only to
forbear robbing Papists of their Goods, on pretence of carrying away
their Images and Pictures, but are to honour the Image of God shining in
the lives of, or the Gifts of God dispensed to any Papists.
Mr. Burroughs in his Irenicum, p. 38. saith, We accounted it Tyranny
and Persecution in the Bishops, when they would not suffer such as could not
conform to their Church Discipline and Ceremonies, to teach Grammar or
practise Physick: and saith, That there was no dependance between their
Errors (if you will call them so) and these things. To deny the Church
and Commonwealth the benefit of the Gifts and Graces of Men, on such a
pretence that they will abuse their Liberty, we thought it was hard dealing;
yea no less than a Persecution. Suppose a man differs from his Brethren in
point of Church Discipline, must not this man have a place in an Army there|fore?
Tho he sees not the reason of such a Discipline in the Church, yet God
hath endued him with a Spirit of Valour, and he understands what Military
Discipline means, c.
Ought not then Persons of his Principles to revere the Heroical En|dowments
of an Heir to the Crown, which do much preponderate as
to the continuance of the being and well-being of the Kingdom, to sup|posed

Orthodoxy in some Mysteries of the Gospel, as was shewn out of
Mr. Ny? King Iames had great Talents in Polemical Divinity, to prove
by words, that the Pope was Anti-Christ; but will not these latter Endow|ments
necessarily prevent the Pope's being Anti-Christ in Deeds, if he
were inclined to hurt us by shewing himself such? Ames in his Purita|nismus
Anglicanus giveth this as the chief Reason why the Puritans hold
the Bishop of Rome to be THE Anti-Christ, viz. For that he being an
Ecclesiastical Ruler doth arrogate and exercise the chief Power over Kings
and Princes. And doth any one fear that he can exercise such Power
over a Prince of these Endowments? And I may add, have not many
Factious and Republican Nominal Protestants here compleated that Fi|gure
of Anti-Christ? How many Vertues must any indifferent man over|look
in this Pope, who thinks he would outrage our Civil Government,
and how many Vices must he wink at in such Persons who thinks they
would not do it?
And by Virtue of our blessed Lords having decided it that he was the
better Son who said he would not do the Will of his Father and did it, may
it not be said, That those Papists who say they will not take these
Oaths, and yet perform their Natural Allegiance, are more loyal than
such Nominal Protestants, who have took the Oaths and observe them
not? As much an Abhorrer as I am of the Principles of the Iesuites Con|demned
by this Pope, I shall yet think my self bound by the Moral Offi|ces
beforementioned out of Ames, not to charge the belief or practice of
them on all Persons in that Order. For when I consider the Devotional
Books of some Iesuites, writ with such strong and lively expressions of
the Practick part of Religion, as any Person of Candor will think to be
founded on a real deep sense of all Moral Offices lying warm at their
hearts, I account it impossible for them to have believed some of
those Tenets: and as I once observing at the Anatomy of a poor Malefa|ctor,
that his Stomach appeared not able to contain above the Quantity of
a Quart, would easily have thence inferred, had I heard him accused of
being wont in his life-time to debauch by ingurgitating vast quantities of
Liquor, that there could be no such thing, so shall I think it not possible
that this sober Party of the Iesuites who are really devout, can swallow
such Irreligionary Principles, as too many others of them have
done,
We know that not many eminent Popish Writers, but particu|larly
Azorius the Iesuite hath writ against the Iesuites Doctrine of Equi|vocation,
and Mental Reservation: and Crackanthorp and Ames and other
Protestant Writers in their Writings, impeaching that Doctrine of the
Iesuites, have quoted Azorius as on their side in that point.
I doubt not but many Pious Persons of that Order are glad of this Pope's
having damned such Tenets, which they never did or could believe: and I
will now upon the Popes having condemned them, judge no particular
Papist to believe them till I find cause so to do.
And notwithstanding the hard usage our Learned Lord Bishop of Lin|coln's
Book had from the Author of The Compendium saying, That the
Title of the Book confuted the whole, because it mentioned the Principles
approved by the Church of Rome pernicious when really believed and pra|ctised,
I shall still think the Pleonasm or exuberance of the Charity in
so qualifying the danger of the Tenets he confutes, to be worthy a Pre|late
of the Church of England, and do think the like of the Charity of
the Bishop of Winchester expressed in his printed Sermon of the 5th of

November, where having spoke of the Doctrines of Dissenters tending to
Sedition and Rebellion, that seem to be derived from the Church of Rome,
he saith, if those Doctrines are believed and practised, they must necessarily
produce Confusion among us: and do think that if the Papists could gain
the point, namely, to be looked on by Protestants as not to believe seve|ral
parts of the Tenets of Popery that are Irreligionary, and particularly
that about the Exterminium of Hereticks enjoyned by the Lateran Coun|cil
to be not believed by them, it would be a point very well gain'd, and
any one who could gain it for them, would be a more useful friend to
them than ever Bellarmin was.
To give a man the Lye is the greatest dishonour, and therefore when
any Papist shall tell me that he believes not the Lateran Council as obli|ging,
or other Tenets chargeable on the Papacy, I shall not tell him that
he doth, but shall pass my judgment of Charity that he doth not believe
the same, and shall account him still a Roman Catholick tho perhaps
erroneously denying that to be a General Council, as I account Luther a
Christian and Owner of the Authority of the Bible, tho he erroneously
denied the Divine Authority of the Epistle of St. Iames. The Learned
Author of The Advocate of Conscience Liberty printed in the Year 1673.
and said to be Mr. Brown a Franciscan, in his 8th Chapter, viz. Of Roman
Catholicks being not guilty of Practices or Principles destructive to Govern|ment,
and reproaching the ENGLISH and Foreign Protestants with such
Principles saith, Was it from any of their Books (meaning the Books of
the Papists) you have drawn those wild Maxims, That the Authority of the
Magistrate is of Humane Right? That the People are above the King?
That the People can give Power to the Prince and take it away? That if a
King fail in performing his Oath at Coronation, the People are loosened from
their Allegiance? That if Princes fall from the Grace of God, the People
are loosed from their Subjection? Do not these Doctrines proceed from Wic|liff,
Waldenses and other Sectaries? And then mentioning Calvin for
owning such Maxims, saith, That Calvin l. 4. c. 3. Instit. from his high
Consistory giveth this Absolution to all Oaths of that Nature, Quibuscunque
Evangeli hujus lux effulgeat  ab omnibus laqueis juramentisque absol|vitur.
But that Loyal Franciscan there happened to injure Calvin by a
false quotation, which I believe he had took up on the Credit of the Ro|manist
Author of Monarcho-machia or Ierusalem and Babel, who had cited
the 4th Book of Calvin's Institutions for that purpose, but very falsly:
for Calvin in all that Chapter hath not a word of such Oaths of Allegi|ance
as Subjects take to their Sovereigns: but treating only of Mona|stick
Vows, he saith, Nunc postquam veritatis notiti sunt illuminati, simul
Christi grati liberos esse dico, c. i. e. from those Monkish unwarrantable
Vows that they had made, and out of Error and Ignorance held themselves
obliged by.
But I doubt not if Parsons alis Doleman, and the Book of The Prelate
and the Prince had been shewed to this Franciscan, he would have an|swered
to this effect, viz. These men and many Roman Catholick Authors
by them cited, held those disloyal Trayterous Principles beforementioned, but I
fall will a Sacrifice rather than hold such. I honour the spirit of Zeal against
Disloyalty that runneth through his Book, and in p. 204, 205, 206,
207, 208. he very learnedly endeavours to answer the objection about
the Lateran Council, and saith thereupon what the matter will bear:
and he and many other Roman Catholick Writers have disown'd the Au|thority
of that Council as obligatory: and therefore the judgment of

Charity will incline any one to think that such Roman Catholicks
would not disorder the World by it.
Moreover some Protestant Writers have judged that Council to be in|valid,
and Dr. Donne, who was very well studied in the Learning that
relates to the Canon Law and General Councils, doth particularly in his
Pseudo-Martyr p. 377, 378, 379, 380. take a great deal of pains to shew
the invalidity of that Council: and that it was never meant to oblige
Sovereign Princes.
But the Author of The Prelate and the Prince doth in p. 228, 229,
230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236. with much Learning statuminate
the Authority of that Council: and asserts it to have been a General one,
as the Cardinal Perron and the Bishop of Lincoln have done: yet what
I have mentioned of that Famous Cardinal's not believing the Principle of
the Church of Rome founded on that Council for Princes exterminating
their Heretical Subjects as always Obligatory, nor promoting the pra|ctice
thereof in France, where the Huguenots were then about a 7th part
of the whole People, hath justified the reasonableness of the Charity of
our Bishops in qualifying the danger of some Papal Principles with the
restriction of their being really believed and practised: and the same Rule
in my Notion of their danger shall always guide me, that is to say, when
the Poyson of such Principles is really swallowed, it must then be pernici|ous.
The poyson may lie in the Boxes of the Canon Law or a General
Council, and yet not poyson the minds of pious Catholicks, nor foul their
fingers. I having found just cause so far to honour all the Roman Catho|licks
of my Acquaintance, as to judge them free from any Complication
of the belief and practice of any irreligious Principles with the Princi|ples
of their Religion, and particularly from the owning any Principle of
Disloyalty or the Iesuites Doctrine of Calumny, or the Obligatoriness of
the Lateran Council, will not rashly pronounce any other particular
Papist guilty of the belief or practice of such Principles.
Nor is it any great honour that I have done to any men of extraordi|nary
Vertue in thus judging, that they cannot believe or practise such
Principles: for that it being true in the Course of Nature what Machiavel
said, that next to the being perfectly good, 'tis the most difficult thing
to be perfectly bad, the World hath had thereby some Garranty against
the belief and practice of such Principles, and by necessity of Nature must
still have.
But since Mankind in general may expect to find in our esteem the
benefit of the presumption of Law, viz. That every man is presumed to
be good, and that the high Births and Educations of Princes and the
great Examples of their Magnanimous Ancestors, may well pass as strong
presumptions of Nature against their doing any low ungenerous Acts of
Cruelty, and since in Gods great Ordinance of Magistracy an especial Di|vine
presence may by Virtue of Holy Writ be presumed to accompany
the very Magistrates appointed by Sovereign Prines, according to that
in 2 Chron. 19. 6. where after it was said to the Judges, Take heed what
you do, for yee judge not for man but for the Lord, the following words are,
Who is with you in the Iudgment? and that therefore as Christ is said to
be present with those Officers he appointed in the Church, because there is a
special Virtue and Efficacy of Christ manifest in their Ministry, there may
likewise be expected a special presence Divine in the Administration of Ma|gistracy
from the like manifestation of God in his Wisdom, Power, Goodness, c.
for the Well-fare of Societies, (as Mr. Ny observes) and since Kings and

Princes are an Odinance of God or Medium by which in a more special
and peculiar way he communicates his Goodness to Christians according to
the Style of the 13th of the Romans (the great Sedes materae of Loyalty)
for he is the Minister of God to THEE for good, it may well be thought
profaneness and Sacrilege for men to bode and presume ill of the future
Acting of any Heirs to Crowns: and particularly as to their believing
or practising any thing pernicious to their Realms.
What Roman Catholick Prince doth not deride Innocent the 3d (under
whom the Lateran Council was held) for telling it in the Canon Law
that the Papal Power is as much greater than the Imperial, as the Sun is
greater than the Moon, and at the Marginal Note there for saying That
the Papal Power exceeds the Imperial no less than 7744? There is a Prince
whose Emblem is the Su, and whose Power exceeds the Papal in every
ones account to more than that Proportion. And is it not therefore but
according to reason and common sense that we should believe that of all
men in any Realm, the Prince will be the latest brought to the belief of
that Papal Power so categorically asserted by that Council, That Kings may
be Excommunicated by their own Bishops for not obeying the Pope, and their
Subjects in such Case be absolved from their Oaths of Allegiance? Do not
all the French Kings, notwithstanding that Council, claim the liberty of so
much freedom from the Papal Power, that Popes can neither directly nor
indirectly command or ordain any thing concerning Temporal Matters
within their Dominions, and that neither the French King, nor his Realm,
nor his Officers can be Excommunicated or interdicted by the Pope, nor
his Subjects absolved from their Oath of Allegiance?
As I have therefore in my Writing to a Noble Lord, one of his Maje|sty's
Ministers, who was barbarously accused by one of the Plot-Witnes|ses
for being a Papist, and designing to advance the Papal Power, said that I
would be the last man in England, who would believe he could be a Papist,
meaning it as impossible that he could believe or practise any irreligionary
Tenet of Popery, I will account it more impossible that any Roman Ca|tholick
Prince now living in the World should favour the Usurpation of
the Papal Power, however any of the Popish Clergy or Layety in his
Realms might perhaps be addicted to favour the same.
That great Affair of the Munster Pace wherein so many great Roman
Catholick Crown'd Heads, agreeing perhaps in the Lateran Coun|cil
being a General one, did yet certainly agree together in the Year
1648 for Lutheran and Calvinistick Princes and States and their Sub|jects
quietly possessing forever their Properties both in their Religions
and Estates, hath afforded the World an important Instance of Heavens so
far influencing the understandings of those Crown'd Heads, that they
thought not themselves obliged to put the Decree of that Council in pra|ctice
by exterminating Hereticks, but to the contrary. And because
the Affair of that Peace and the great Pacta Conventa therein for the effect
aforesaid, have been scarce more taken Notice of here than the Trans|actions
in China, and that the notification of the same may advance the
measures of our Duty by Internal Communion, and help to un-blunder
some of our Nominal Protestants in their fancying it so necessary for the
quiet of Christendom, that Christian Princes and their Subjects should
agree in the belief of the Speculative points of Religion, I intend to take
an opportunity to publish some Account of the same.
I account my having thus largely dilated on the Moral Offices as afore|said,
hath tended to corroborate this my 8th Conclusion. I am here conver|sants

in the great Court of Conscience, the Court whose Seat is in the Pra|ctical
and not Speculative intellect, and the great things of which it holds
Plea are, as Sanderson tells us, Actus morales particulares proprii: and
therefore particular urging of Records, against which lies no averment,
is not more pertinent in Courts of Law than of Moral Offices in this.
And moreover I observing in this Conjuncture when many mens zeal hath
been so hot against the Speculative points of Popery, which disturb not
Civil Society, that yet they have believed the more pernicious Te|net
of it, and would have practised the same, viz. The founding Dominion
in Grace, and that tho they have been altogether neglectul of their
Actus morales particulares proprii, they have both presumed to judge
dishonourably and rashly of the Actings of others, and to trouble the
World not only with their Anxiety about the Acts of Kings and Princes,
but the Actus Dei, and his illuminating Princes understandings with the
Heavenly Mysteries, I have thought this discoursing of our Moral Offices
as aforesaid, the more a Propos and seasonable, as tending to fortify the
rationality of this 8th Conclusion, by exposing the absurdity of a respe|ctive
or conditional Loyalty, a Loyalty that any Christian who hath ta|ken
these Oaths shall think sufficient, doth most certainly take the name
of Loyalty and Protestancy and of Christianity, and even of God in vain:
and as the Scripture implies that there is a Repentance to be repented of,
I shall say that such a mans Protestancy is to be protested against. And
when we consider that the Presbyterian Author of the EXERCITATION
beforementioned, hath in p. 41. with so much Loyalty and Reason told
us in terms, That Obedience is owing to Princes without condition of Reli|gion,
or Iustice on their part performed, and the Scripture is clear for an
irrespective and (in regard of the Rulers Demeanor) absolute subjection.
Exod. 20. 12. 21. 25. Rom. 13. 1, 2, c. Tit. 3. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 1 Sam.
24. 6, 7. 26. 9, 10, 11. Jer. 27. 12. 29. 7. Matth. 22. 21. and hath told
us in p. 56. That our Oaths put no condition on the Prince, but are all ab|solute
and irrespective, and run without ifs or ands in like manner as the Ob|ligation
of Subjects Allegiance to their Sovereign is irrespective according to
Divine Institution, methinks it should make any Son of the Church of
England to start at the thought of his being out-done in Loyalty, and
sworn Allegiance by a Covenanting Presbyterian (for such that Author
was) and at the thought of any ones having taken those Oaths relating
to the King, his Heirs and Successors, and afterward interlining the inter|pretation
of them with ifs and ands, and at the thought of such an inter|lineation
not appearing as ill in the Court of Conscience, as any would do
in a Court of Law.
But the truth is the Church of England appearing in this late Reli|gionary
Fermentation, to have so incorporated this Doctrine of absolute
and irrespective Loyalty into its Constitution beyond any other Church
in the World, and likewise the Doctrine of Charity and Moderation toward
all Christians, whether Foreigners or Domesticks, whether whole Churches or
single Persons (as Primate Bramhal's words are) that the same doth now
(as I may say) strike the Eyes of all indifferent men and enforce it self
on the thoughts of any who do but for Curiosity walk about this Sion and
go round about her and tell the Towers thereof, I mean do consider its
Prayers, Homilies, Articles, Canons and Ecclesiastical Constitutions, it
hath hereby been necessarily made like the Eagle to renew its youth, and
to be invigorated as with a new Soul after its Enemies thought it dead
or asleep, and after Mr. Hooker's shrewd guessing that after the Year 1677.

That what followed would be likely to be small joy to them who should behold
it. For the Doctrine of absolute and irrespective Loyalty being Essential
to the Peace of Kingdoms, and likely to be so more and more to the
Worlds end, and the Church of England appearing as by consent of
Parties to be THE Church that overtowers all others in the Principles
for THAT Sort of Loyalty, as well as in the august Principles of Charity
for all Christians; according to the saying of Magnes amoris amor, it must
naturally attract the love of thoe in other Churches, and supposing that
any Church or People love themselves and cannot be preserved but by
Loyalty, Nature will direct the World to a growing love for the Church
of England: and therefore I am no Visionaire in predicting from natu|ral
Causes, That what shall follow to the Church of England will be great
joy to those who shall behold it, to the very end of time. And nothing
could possibly in my opinion have brought it to this firm State of its
Glory, but the disloyal Principles and Practices of some of its Compe|titors,
and particularly the just and dreadful apprehensions given to
considerate men upon some Nominal Protestants and Nominal Property|men,
having founded Dominion in Grace, and yet having reproached the
Church of England and its Divines with Popery, and invited the Pro|testant
Mobile to make a Schism from it on such an account, and printed
many Seditious Pamphlets for the Establishing the IF, or AND-Loyalty, or
indeed which is all one, an absolute Disloyalty, and in such a Conjuncture,
when it would have been not more pernicious to the particular Souls of
the Disloyal than to the Body of the whole Nation, and to the State of
Christendom.
Thus through the Divine Omnipotence, which can bring good out
of evil, hath our late Fermentation been made perfective to our Church,
as well as the Hereditary Monarchy, and the Rule of God's governing
the World by the Prayers of his Church and Lusts of his Enemies, been
here exemplified: and as the Air that is the Steem of the dull Earth,
or the Textura halituum terrae, as Gassendus calls it, is made by nature to
be the Vehicle of those Beams of the Sun that dazle our Eyes; thus have
the Fumes, exhaled by such mens Lusts of Disloyalty and Malice that
darken'd their own understandings (and would have obscured the glory
of the Church of England) been made instrumental in dispersing its
brightness through the World, and even in the opening of the Eyes of
many to behold it with amazement; and that service hath been done
our Church thereby, which by all the Pens of its Iewel and Hooker and
Sanderson could never be effected.
England that had so much the Carriage and the Trade of the World till
the Munster Peace of 48, could bear the Civil War after 41, and breathe un|der
it and flourish after it; but as the State of the World abroad and at
home now is and likely to be, our ALL must depend upon the Principles
and Practice of Loyalty, and therefore this new Soul I spake of as now ani|mating
the Church of England must be immortal, and it may well say
to it self under any Prince that can come, Soul take thy ease, thou hast
Loyalty and the Principles of it laid up for many years, and England did
not before 48 more excel other Realms in Trade, than its Church doth
now other Churches in absolute and irrespective Loyalty.
That great Iudge of Churches and their Principles, Arch-Bishop Laud,
having in p. 36. of his famous Star-Chamber Speech remarked the dange|rous
Consequence of avowing, That the Popish Religion is Rebellion, saith,
That some Principles of theirs teach Rebellion, is apparently true, c. and

I shall add, that some Principles of our late Covenanting Dissentes have
taught it, is apparently true; and for such of the latter who believed and
practised these Principles, to reproach any Papists with Disoyalty,
is as apparently ridiculous as was Mr. Prynn's, writing two Voluminous
Tractates of The Disloyalty of Papists at the time when he was ma|king
so great a Figure in the late Rebellion. But however, suitably to
the Moral Offices urged by Ames of not condemning whole Parties of
men on the account of the guilt of some Persons, I have under this Con|clusion
cited the loyal Principles of some Recusants of all sorts pertinent
to my Scope: and because the irrespective Loyalty that I affirm therein
we have obliged our selves to by our Oaths, is so incomparably asserted in a
long Speech of that Great Man of the Church of Rome, Reginaldus Bel|nensis,
Arch-Bishop of Bourges in France, I shall refer any one to it as
printed in huanus. The Speech was spoke in a Famous Assembly and on
a great occasion, for to make way for the quiet Reception of Harry the
4th of France while a Protestant into the Throne; and it was framed
with such profound thoughts of Loyalty, and with such extraordinary
Learning referring both to the old and new Testament, and to Fathers
and Church History, and Civil and Canon Law, and with such close and
nervous argumentation to evince the Divine Right of Allegiance due to
Princes, and particularly without any respect had to their Religion, that
it may pass for one of the best Bullwarks of absolute Loyalty I know of
next to the 13th of the Romans and other things contained in Holy
Writ. And because I think no serious Christian who reads t will ever
find in his heart afterward to ridicule passive oedience, or make ridicu|lous
Platforms of Conditional Loyalty, I do intend to Translate and Pub|lish
it. Moreover because there is in that Speech one Noble peculiar Cha|racter
of the Moral Offices of Loyalty, wherein it is pity that the pro|verbial
English good nature should in any men come short of that of the
French Civility, and any Protestants Loyalty of a Roman-Catholicks, I
mean that Arch-Bishops honouring the Mind and Soul of his Prince, who
was not of the Communion of his Church, and even then vindicating
him from Heresy, and saying, That he ought not to be thought a Heretick,
and propping up his honourable thoughts of his Prince with a Quotation
out of St. Austin, viz. That he was not to be reckon'd among Hereticks who
without pertinacy defended his opinion tho erroneous, c I think the hang|ing
up so great a Picture in publick view, wherein that Man of God did
with such exquisite draught, design, and colour thus paint his Princes
Character and that of his own Loyalty to Eternity, may be variously
useful: and the very sight of the great Colours in which cannot methinks
but raise the little ones of Blushes in any Nominal Protestants who do
with such foul and hard hands handle the Religionary Concernments of
Kings who are Nominal Gods, and make no difference between the dan|ger
of Heterodoxy in Subjects and in Princes.
I have mentioned it that there is less danger of any Princes believing
or practising what may favour the Papal Usurpation than of such Belief
or Practice in a Subject, and it were an easie matter to instance in many
erroneous Religionary Tenets, which as held by Parties among Subjects
may cause general apprehensions of danger, but from which as held by a
Prince it would be ridiculous to fear any ill, or to imagine that the Prince
can imbibe the dregs of those Tenets as they discriminate discontented
Parties: as for example, how can any one fear that a Prince by believing
that Personal Reign of Christ on Earth for a thousand years would hurt

his own Government? or that a Prince by eing a Socinian, ould hold the
Tenet of the unlawfulness of Defensie War? or that a Prince, who fa|voured
the Order of the Iesuites, would approve of their Teets of Ca|lumny
and Equivocation, c. and several of their vile Casuistical Tenets?
or that any Magistracy would permit some of their Apologies, and par|ticularly
that of Guymenius, to be so much as published in the Laguage
of the Country?
But the truth is, we are Morally bound to make a great difference in
our Demeanor toward our Princes, when supposed to erre in opinions
about Religion, from the Measures we are allowed to take in relation to
our ellow Subjects so erring. Error is a part of Humane frailty, and
Subjects are Morally bound to conceal the frailties of their Kings, and
not to censure or publish them to their dishonour, and are to be more
ready to Apolgize for their Princes on all occasions, than for their Pa|rents.
S. Peter in that Verse, where the Duty of honouring all Men and
loving the Brotherhood, is mentioned, subjoyns a particular Precept of
honouring the King. We are never to think of the hearts of Kings, but
as being in the hnds of God, nor of any Mists of Errors that may be in
their heads without thinking of the Rays of the Divine Power that like
a Glory surrounds theirs, and which in the usual Concourse of Provi|dence
do dissipate all danger from any Errors within them. Tho in mens
beliefs who are Subjects, Religionary Errors are often complicated with
Irreligionary ones, yet we are to think of the Oyl of the Lords Annoint|ed
as uppermost and appearing above such latter Errors, and suppressing
the Fumes of them in the minds of Princes, and are to fear no more harm
from the Persons of our Princes than from our Guardian Angels differing
from us in many great Religionary Speculations, and are to think with
honour of our King, as an Angel of God to discern between good and bad,
Religion and Irreligion: and it is an absurd thing for any not to imitate
the Popish Arch-Bishop aforesaid in clearing his Prince, tho of another
Communion, from Pertinacy, since such a Moral defect is a humour of po|sitiveness,
that of all men Kings are most naturally free from, and whose
becoming dissidence of their own understandings how great soever, is
Conspicuous by the wearing away so much of their lives in hearing the
advise of their Council. And when ever Passive Obedience is called for
by Princes and must be readily payed as a due Debt, we are even then to
strain our most improved thoughts to find an honourable Interpretation
of our Princes Actions, in like manner as some of the Loyal Non-Con|formists
to the Gallican Church have done, as appears by a Great Observa|tion
in their Book called the Policy of the Clergy of France, a Book that
Maimbourg in print hath acknowledged to be the best lately published by
their Party, viz. That their Princes never made any great Assault on the
Papal Power, but what cost their Protestant Subjects dear.
This, This is Loyalty worthy the name of Christian; and after all if yet
any men will make wanton Suppositions of the beliefs or practices of Sove|reigns
being never so contrary to Religion, let those know that an absolute
and irrespective Loyalty is that which by these Oaths they have obliged
themselves to: and that therefore it is an absurd thing to attempt to
exclude any Heir of the Crown from his Birth-right on any pretence of
his Religion or other pretence whatsoever, since we must pay an absolute
Obedience and Allegiance to him immediately on the Descent of the
Crown to him, and accordingly as by these Oaths we have obliged our
selves to do.

Having thus in these Conclusions asserted the Obligation relating to our
Kings Heirs and Successors, as resulting from the plain and genuine Sense
of the words in the Oaths, altho it is a common, sure Rule, That Verba
ubi sunt expressa, voluntatis supervacanea est quaestio, yet I shall ex super|abundanti
choose to corroborate such my Assertion by laying down this
as my 9th and last Conclusion, that it is manifest that it was the Law-givers
intention to bind the Takers of these Oaths, not only to bear true Faith
and Allegiance to his Majesty, but to his Heirs and Successors in the Due
and Legal Course of Descent, as I have before expressed.
It need not be much dilated on, that Relations are Minimae entitatis,
but Maximae efficaciae: and that, Liberi sunt quasi partes  appendices
parentum, not only Fictione Iuris, but Natur  ei veritate, and that
in the framing of the Oath of Allegiance and the designing the Obligations
to arise thence, the King had a necessary regard to natural affection, and
to the preservation of the Hereditary Monarchy in the Line of his Heirs
and Successors: and suitably to what is expressed in the Preamble of the
Statute of 25 H. 8. c. 22. viz. That since it is the natural inclination of
every man gladly and willingly to provide for the surety of both his Title and
Succession, altho it touch his only private Cause, we therefore reckon our
selves much more bound to beseech and instant your Highness to foresee and
provide for the PRESENT surety of both you and of your most lawful
Succession and Heirs.
Nor need it be much insisted on, that 'tis natural for every Government
to defend and preserve it self: and to this purpose the Author of the Exer|citation
cites Alsted a Lutheran Divine, and likewise Grotius and Dudley
Fenner, for maintaining the lawfulness of what the old Athenian famous
Oath enjoyned for the preservation of its Polity, namely, of any pri|vate
Person killing any Usurper, or one who without a lawful Title for|cibly
invaded the Government. The Athenians had several Oaths of a high
nature, by the Religion of which they tyed themselves to defend their
Government: and one was the Iusjurandum epheborum, which they took
when 20 years old, and which is set down in Petitus his Noble Com|mentary
on the Athenian Laws, and part of which as rendered by him in|to
Latin, is, Patriam liberis non relinquam in deteriore sed potius in meliore
statu. Navigabo ad terram eamque colam, quantulacunque illa sit quae ha|benda
mihi tradetur. Parebo legibus quae obtinent, c. quod si quis leges
abrogare velit, populo non sciscente, minime feram. Vindicabo autem sive
solus, sive cum aliis omnibus. Patria sacra colam, c. ad mortem usque pro
nutrici terr dimicabo. But this Oath, tho famous enough, was not THE
famous one I referred to: but 'tis the other of which the formula is set
down in Petitus there, p. 232, 233. and which beginneth with Occidam
me ipsius manu si possim eum qui everterit Rempublicam Atheniensium, aut
e evers Magistratum gesserit in posterum, c. That Oath of so high
and strange a nature was made shortly after the driving out the thirty
Tyrants and the Law made, that Si quis Atheniensium Rempublicam ever|tat,
aut e evers Magistratum gerat, Atheniensium hostis esto, impunque
occiditor, c.
To secure their Government forever from future Usurpation was the
intent of that terrible Oath: and to secure the Government of the Here|ditary
Monarchy here was the intent of our gentle ones, and sufficiently
favouring of the Mansuetudo Evangelii, and which Oaths, however bind|ing
the Loyal to defend the Government with their lives, do yet strict|ly
bind to the defence of the Rights and Privileges of the Crown, one

of which is both by the 13th of the Romans, and the Lex terrae, to be a
terror to the Evil, and to bear the Sword.
But Sir E. Coke having told us in his Commentaries, That the true
Scope and design of our Statute Laws are oftentimes not to be understood with|out
the knowledge of the Histry of the Age when the particular Statute
was made, I shall (looking back on the Conjuncture when the Act for
the Oath of Allegiance was made) take notice, that by many particular
matters then obvious to all mens thoughts, it appeared worthy of the
wisdom of the Government then to provide for the security both of his
Majesty and of the Succession
Any who shall read D' Ossat's Letters will find the various deep designs
there opened, that related to several Foreign Princes and Potentates Jea|lousies
of the Power that England would have in the balance of the
World, by the uniting of the strength of Scotland to it upon the rightful
Succession of King Iames to the Monarchy: and perhaps rather out of
a design to amuse them than out of an humour to put by the thoughts of
Mortality, Queen Elizabeth did shew so much unwillingness sometimes
to hear and speak of her Successor. And during the constrained Altum si|lentium
of the Succession then here, a Book of the Succession was writ by
Father Parsons, and which made noise enough in the World, as those
Letters mention, and by which Book the Author intended that our He|reditary
Monarchy should be Thunder struck, especially with the help
of the Papal Breves that came here to obstruct the Succession. King
Iames at the end of his Premonition to all Christian Monarchs, printing
a Catalogue of the Lyes of Tortus (i. e. Bellarmin) with a brief Confuta|tion
of them, refers to one Lye of Tortus, p. 47, viz. In which words [of
the Breves of Clement the 8th] not only King James of Scotland was not
EXCLVDED, but included rather: and the Confutation is thus, viz. If
the Breves of Clement did not exclude me from the Kingdom, but rather
did include me, why did Garnet burn them? Why would he not reserve
them that I might have seen them, that so he might have obtained more fa|vour
at my hands for him and his Catholicks? And that King in his Apo|logy
for the Oath of Allegiance, p. 29. refers to the two Breves which Cle|mens
Octavus sent to England immediately before Queen Elizabeth's Death,
debarring him from the Crown, or any other that either would profess or any
ways tolerate the Professors of his Religion: contrary to the Pope's Manifold
Vows and Protestations Simul  eodem tempore and, as it were, delivered
uno  eodem spiritu to divers of his Majesty's Ministers abroad, professing such
kindness and shewing such forwardness to advance his Majesty to the English
Crown.
Any one who reads in D' Ossat the inclination of that Pope to Princi|ples
and Practices of this kind, will not wonder at his Majesty's thus ex|posing
his Vn-holyness: and the nature of the Breves is sufficiently there
explained, and proved to be according to his Majesty's measures publish|ed
of them.
That Great King was sufficiently acquainted with the Principles and
Practices of the Papacy, that had been so injurious to Hereditary Mo|narchs.
He knew that a Popish Parliament in England had shewed
their Abhorrence of the Pope's being somewhat like an Excluder-Gene|ral
of Kings, and an Arbitrary one too, as appeared by the Words in the
Statute of 25 H. 8. viz. The Pope contrary to the inviolable Grants of Iu|risdictions
by God immediately to Emperors and Kings, hath presumed to
invest who should please him to inherit in other mens Kingdoms and Domini|ons,

which we your Loyal Subjects Spiritual and Temporal abhor and detest:
and the practices at Rome for King Iames's Exclusion had made deep im|pressions
in his thoughts. As he was a Prince of great Reading he could
not but know particularly the many Anti-Monarchical Tenets that were
published by many Popish Commentators, positive Writers, School-men,
Canonists, and never censured by any Index Expurgatorius, tho yet several
Popish Authors who asserted the Power of Kings were so censured, and
particularly Bodin de Republic: and he could not be ignorant of Popes
having required several Crowned Heads to swear Fidelity to them and
their Successors, and that particularly the Pope sent Hubertus to require
William the Conqueror o swear Allegiance and Fidelity to Him and his Suc|cessors,
and who magnanimously refused so to do: and that the Papacy
endeavoured to root its Power in the World by obliging men in their
Oaths of Fidelity to any particular Pope, to swear the same likewise to
his Successors, according to the common Style in those Oaths, viz. Fide|lis
 obediens ero Domino Papae, c.  suis successoribus: and that thus
too the Oath of all Popish Bishops at their Consecration runs; and that
the Great Austrian Family had not more carefully secured to it self the
Scepters of the Empire by the Constitution of a King of the Romans, than
the Papacy had made Provision of that King's being sworn that he would
from that time be a Protector and Defender of the Pope and Church of
Rome, according to those words in the Oath as I find it set down in Mage|rus,
viz. Ego N. Rex Romanorum FVTVRVS Imperator, promitto, spondeo,
 polliceor, atque juro Deo  leato Petro me de caetero protectorem, atque
desensorem fore summi Pontisicis  sanctae Ecclesiae Romanae, c.
He had moreover considered the great Fermentation in the minds of
so many Loyal People in England, by Queen Elizabeth's being so re|served
as She was in the business of the Succession, and which as Dr.
Matthew Hulton Arch-Bishop of York mentioned in a memorable Sermon
he preached before her at White-Hall, Gave hopes to Foreigners to attempt
fresh Invasions, and bred fears in many of her Subjects of a new Conquest,
and who thereupon very loyally said then, The only way in Policy left to
quell those hopes and asswage those fears were to Establish the Succession, and
at last intimating as far as he durst (saith my Author) the nearness of
Blood of our present Sovereign, he said plainly, That the expectations and
presages of all Writers went Northward, naming without any Circumlocu|tion
Scotland. There is an Abstract of this Loyal and Learned Sermon
(and which throughout pointed at the Succession) in the History of some
of the Bishops of England in the time of Queen Elizabeth, printed in the
Year 1653: and the fate of the Sermon was such that tho perhaps it
tickled not the Ears of that Queen, it so far touched her Conscience that
the Historian saith, She opened the Window of her Closet and gave the Arch-Bishop
thanks for it.
No doubt but Parsons saying in his Book of the Succession, That he
thought the Affair about it could not be ended, without some War, did much
heighten the Popular Fears of War happening thereupon: and 'tis most
probable the long fear of War in that Fermentation did variously wea|ken
the Kingdom. Nor is it a new thought for the long fears of War
to be held to bear some proportion to the mischief of War it self, in ob|structing
Trade and Commerce; insomuch that several Writers of the
Regalia and fiscal matters among the Tractatus Illustrium, have told us,
That Quando timor belli idem operatur quod ipsum bellum, remissio sit con|ductoribus,
(i. e. of the Revenue) and hath Entituled them to defalca|tions.

We may imagine by the just effects of our late Fermentation,
what the state of the Body Politick was in that, namely, like the state
of long tormenting anguish in the Body natural upon the pricking of an
Artery, and importing often more trouble and danger than the cutting
of one. And by the great triumphant Flame of joy appearing in the Act of
Recognition in King Iames's time, (and which appears in our Statute-Book,
as I may say, lke a Pyramid of the Fire of Zealous Loyalty, and greater and
higher than any former Act of that nature) we may judge how overjoy|ed
all the Loyal People of England were on his coming to the Crown:
and as Pliny in his Panegyrick, saith of Nerva's adopting Trajan, It was im|possible
it should have pleased all when it was done, except it had pleased all be|fore
it was done, the same might be applied to the Case of King Iames's Suc|cession
to the Crown. The very Title of the Act speaks the Triumph of
the Hereditary Monarchy, viz. A Recognition, that the Crown of England is
lawfully descended to King James, his Progeny, and Posterity. There was
an end of all the dreadful inconveniences of the uncertainty of the Suc|cession,
and of the fears of the People of what was worse than being torn
in pieces by wild Hrses, I mean the rending their Consciences by con|trary
Oaths about the Succession, as in Harry the 8th's time. There was
an end of the ears from the growing greatness of France, and fears of
any Foreign Fremuerunt gentes. England was restored to it self, and
Scotland added to it: and tho Boccaline like an airy Igenioso in his Poli|tick
Touchstone makes England weigh less on the throwing Scotland into
the Scales, any one will find that in him but grave Romancery, who shall
consider what with Oracular Wisdom another-guess Statos-man than Boc|caline
told Harry the 4th, I mean D'Ossat in his long Letter to him from
Rome, Book 7th, and Anno 1601. where he saith, That the Pope desisted
not to hope that his Maiesty might be perswaded by reason of State to endea|vour
that the Kingdoms of England and Scotland may not be joyned in the
Person of one King, considering the great mischiefs that the English alone
have done to the French more than all other Nations put together, c.
And indeed that England is at this day preserved not only from the
danger of being overbalanced by France, but from the loss of its anci|ent
figure of balancing the World, must highly be attributed to the He|reditary
Monarchy being fixt in the Line of King Iames, and to Scotland
being thrown into the Scales as was said: and if any one shall tell me
by the way, that the weight of Scotland was prejudicial to Loyalty in
41, I shall answer him, that its weight hath in this present Conjuncture
of 81 afforded Loyalty so great a Compensation by that late Act of Par|liament
there acknowledging and asserting the Right of the Succession, c.
and which begins thus, viz. The Estates of Parliament considering that
the Kings of this Realm deriving their Royal Power from God Almighty
alone, do succeed lineally thereunto according to the known Degrees of Proxi|mity
in Blood, c. that as Historians tell us how in the dark barbarous
times many hundreds of years since men repaired from all Countries to
Ireland, to learn the Liberal Arts and Sciences, I shall say that they may
now profitably go to Scotland to learn Loyalty: and I doubt not but that
Kingdom which is so notorious for its mortal, or immortal hatred of Po|pery
(call it which you will) and even of that very part of it which I
call the Religionary one of it, having thus by the Exterminium of that
irreligionary part of it, viz. That Dominion is founded in Grace, taught us
Loyalty in the establishing the Hereditary Lineal Succession, may be as
instrumental in giving Loyalty in the Body of the People here, its tempe|ramentum

ad pondus, as it was formerly in oppressing us with its weight,
as a gravamen, and be an occasion of blessing our Land with such a joy|ful
Conjuncture of time as ensued after King Iames's Succession, as I have be|fore
mentioned, and to the Consideration of which I shall return.
England that had formerly, by reason of the uncertainty of the Suc|cession,
being like the Erratica Delos, a floating Island, and that too in Seas
of Blood, and did then appear like it afterward, fixed and blessed with a
Pacifick and Oracular King, and as strong a Foundation for the Hereditary
Monarchy as could be wished, was shortly after in danger of being again
unfixed by the Outrage of the Gun-Powder Treason, and the Principles
that legitimated that practice, being really believed and practised; and
an account of the practice of which Treason we have in the Statute of
3^o Iacobi c. 2. as likewise of the fiery Principles that animated the Actors
to it in Thuanus; and in King Iames his Premonition to all Christian Mo|narchs,
p. 10. a general reference is made to the violent bloody Maxims
that the Powder-Traytors maintained: and by occasion whereof after the
designed outrage against the Lineal Succession of the Prince and the
Hereditary Monarchy being in danger while such bloody Principles and
Maxims were not exterminated, it was in ordinary prudence requisite to
apply the extraordinary Remedy of the Oath of Allegiance, to rivet that
Fundamental Maxim of the Crown the stronger in Nature, viz. That the
King never dies. And the Addition of those words in the Promissory Clause
of the Oath of Allegiance, viz. HIS or THEIR Persons, THEIR Crown
and Dignity, and which words were not in the Oath of Supremacy, was a
plain indication of the intention of the Law-givers to tye Mens Souls
to the Hereditary Monarchy in the Due and Legal Course of Descent.
And moreover with a prospect to mens having a conscientious regard
to the King's Heirs and Successors, the Fathers of our Church then
probably in the Preface of the Collect in the Common-prayer for the Prince
and the King's Children, as overjoyed with the sight of King James's being
enriched with a most Royal Progeny (as the words in the Act of the Re|cognition
are) did cause these words to be inserted, Who art the Father of
thine Elect and of their SEED.
The Preface to the Act requiring the Oath of Allegiance, hath in it
the expression of Loyalty and Allegiance unto the King's Majesty and the
CROWN of England, and mentions the design of the Gun-powder Trea|son
as tending to the subversion of the whole State: and therefore if in the
ancient times of Popery (and when the Pope was generally revered here
as a 13th Apostle) upon any emergent Papal Usurpations which gave
just cause of apprehending future ones intended, and particularly in the
Case of the Pope's Mandates or Bulls, which were called Gratiae expecta|tivae
or provisiones, and pretendedly issued out of the Pope's pious care to see
a Church provided of a Successor before it needed, our Kings did think
themselves obliged to provide Statutes against Provisors, whereby the Ius
patronatus was secured to them and their Subjects, and by Statutes of
Praemunire did as it were build Forts before the Enemies coming, the Pre|muniment
of the Hereditary Monarchy by the Oath of Allegiance, was
most necessary to prevent any Papal Gratiae expectativae of the Crown,
and the Popes impious care to provide a Successor to its Hereditary
Rights. The Premuniment of some Laws by others is no new thing nor
yet a new word, however some idle Criticks have accounted the word
praemunire in our Statutes to be barbarous; for Grotius in his De jure belli,
c. l. 2. c. 5. . 14. speaking of some Laws of the Iews saith, In

quarum ,  ut Hebraei loquntur praemunimentum additae sunt
leges caeterae: and according to the sense of some taking praemunire for
praemonere, the constant premonition of Heavens great Monitor called
Conscience, (and which is the pulse of the Soul, and like the Pulse is Fidelis
nuncius vitae aut mortis) to warn men by this Oath to defend the Lineal
Succession of the Crown, was no less necessary: and King Iames's set|ling
the Premonition in the minds of his own Subjects, was but natural|ly
previous to his Premonition sent abroad to Foreign Princes and States.
And how far Harry the 7th's Statute by which no Person who should
serve the King for the time being, c. should therefore be attainted or im|peached,
might induce the Government to secure the undoubted Rights
of Succession, by the Oath of Allegiance being framed as it was, and
rooting our Loyalty thereby the deeper into our Consciences, and by the
fear of our being justly impeached in the Court of Conscience in omnem
eventum, if we defended not those Rights of Succession, is obvious to
Consideration.
As I have thus in this Conclusion shewed that it was the Law-givers
intention, particularly in the Oath of Allegiance to oblige us to pay our
Allegiance not only to the King, but to his Heirs and Successors in the
Legal Course of Descent, so I might here further Ex superabundanti
dilate on such intention being to secure the same without any respect to
the Religion of such Heirs and Successors. A Prince of such profound
Learning and Observation as King Iames could not be ignorant of what
hath been since, by the Loyal Writers of the Succession, so clearly and
strongly asserted, viz. That the Succession to the Crown is inseparably
annext to the Proximity of Blood by the Laws of GOD and NATVRE,
and That Statute-Laws contrariant to those are null and void, and
That the Hereditary Monarchy was indisputably founded on inherent Birth-right
according to the Style of the Act of Recognition, and not any Re|ligionary
Regeneration, and That the accession of the Crown purgeth all Ob|structions.
And that that Prince did by the Oath of Allegiance design only to
twist the Band of our natural Allegiance the stronger (an Allegiance
tyed not to Princes Faith of the Cross, but to their Crown) appears
throughout his Apology for the Oath of Allegiance. He likewise in his
Premonition to all Christian Monarchs, p. 9. doth with some warmth of
words reflect on the Malice of some who impudently affirm, That the Oath of
Allegiance was devised for deceiving and entrapping of Papists in point of
Conscience: and saith, That tho the House of Commons at the first framing
of the Oath made it to contain, That the Pope had no Power to excommuni|cate
me, which I caused them to reform, only making it to conclude that no
Excommunication of the Popes can warrant my Subjects to practise against
my Person or State, c. so careful was I that nothing should be contained in
this Oath except the profession of Natural Allegiance, and Civil and Tempo|ral
Obedience, with a promise to resist to all contrary uncivil violence. From
thence it appears that what looked like the Religionary part of Popery,
namely, the Pope's exercising a Spiritual Power against him, or the No|tion
as Aquinas delivers it, That there is Potestas in summo Pontifice puni|endi
omnes mortales ratione delicti, he intended not to whet the sharpness
of the Oath against, but only against the Irreligionary part of Popery be|forementioned,
and as to which he might rationally depend on the Zeal
of any Heir or Successor tho Roman Catholick concurring with his there|in.

He having in the foregoing Page mentioned how that Parliament that
was to have been blown up, made some new Laws against Papists, saith,
So far hath my Heart and Government been from any bitterness as almost
never one of those sharp Additions to the former Laws have ever yet been
put in Execution. The Execution of some Laws of pecuniary Mulcts on
Papists who in that Conjuncture believed the irreligionary part of the
Papal Power, might seem to carry such a Face of Justice with it, as
the practice of the Custom-house doth pursuant to the 13th and 14th of
Harry the 8th, c. 4. Whereby any English man or born Subject of England,
who shall swear Obeysance or live as Subjects to any Foreign Prince shall pay
Aliens Customs: but 'tis a madness to think of any Prince's abdicating his
Temporal Power, and swearing Temporal Obeysance to any one, and no
man but he who has Laesa principia, can suppose that King Iames, who
avowed in his Premonition, That no man in his time or the late Queens ever
died for his Religion nor yet any Priests after their taking Orders beyond
Sea, without some other guilt in them than their bare coming home, and who
p. 16. of his Apology avows and maintains to his own knowledge, that Queen
Elizabeth never punished any Papists for Religion, but that their punishment
was ever extorted out of her hands against her will by their own mis-beha|viour,
could ever intend that by the withdrawing of Allegiance from
any of his Heirs in the Course of their Lineal Succession, on the pre|tence
of any of their Religionary Notions or other pretence or ground
whatsoever, there should be a solutio continui or political death inflicted
on the Hereditary Monarchy, by the preserving of which the lives of
all the People of England could only be preserved.
He in his Premonition and Apology discharged the Moral Offices of ho|nouring
all men, with relation to Papists his Subjects, and judgeth some
of them to be of quiet dispositions and good Subjects, and in p. 3, 4. 46, 47
48. of his Apology, he makes a difference between many of his Popish
Subjects who retained in their hearts the print of their natur l Duty to their
Sovereign, and those who were carried away with that Fanatical Zeal the
Powder-Traytors were, and useth the expression of quietly minded Papists,
and Papists, tho peradventure zealous in their Religion, yet otherwise civil|ly
honest and good Subjects: and acknowledgeth, That his Mother, altho
she continued in that Religion wherein she was nourished, yet was so far from
being superstitious or jesuited therein, that at his baptism (tho he was bapti|zed
by a Popish Arch-Bishop) she sent him word to forbear to use the spittle in
his Baptism, which was obeyed: and in his Premonition speaking to Roman
Catholick Princes and wishing them to search the Scriptures, and ground their
Faith upon their own certain knowledge, and not on the Report of others,
since every man must be safe by his own Faith: but leaving this to God
his Merciful Providence in his due time, he further wisheth them to imi|tate
their Noble Predecessors, who in the days of greatest blindness, did di|vers
times courageously oppose themselves to the encroaching Ambition of Popes:
and acknowledgeth, That some of their Kingdoms have in all Ages maintain|ed,
and without interruption enjoyed their liberty against the most ambiti|ous
Popes, c. and saith, That some of those Princes have constantly de|fended
and maintained their lawful freedom to their immortal honour: and
concludes his Premonition with earnest Prayers to the Almighty for their
prosperities, and that after their happy Temporal Reigns on Earth, they
may live and Reign in Heaven with him forever.
This Learned King did sufficiently thereby Proclaim himself an Ene|my
to the Papal Tenet of founding Dominion in Grace, as to those Foreign

Popish Princes, and could not therefore but more abhor the effects of it
in the Case of his Hereditary Successors; and he having judged that
those Foreign Princes who owned the Religionary Tenets of Popery, did
yet constantly defend and maintain their lawful freedom from all Papal
Vsurpations to their immortal honour, and with so devout a Charity pray'd
for their happy Temporal Reigns on Earth, and that they may live and
reign in Heaven afterward, could not but suppose that any of his Heirs
who might be of the Roman Catholick Communion would yet disown
any Tenet of Popery that was irreligionary, and would Exterminate all
Papal Vsurpation, and that they might here expect a happy Reign on
Earth, and a happier in Heaven hereafter, leaving it to God to open their
Eyes (as aforesaid) in matters Religionary, and to render them fafe by
their own Faith.
King Iames in his Apology for the Oath of Allegiance doth incidenter,
prop up the Justice of the Oath of Supremacy, and in p. 49, 50, 51.
doth insert 14 contrary Conclusions to all the Points and Articles of which
the Oath of Supremacy consists, to denote the absurdity of the opposing
that Oath: and which Conclusions tho many Clerical and Lay-Papists among
his Subjects might maintain, yet he might well think it Morally impossible
for a Roman Catholick Prince here to do so: and he gives a very good rea|son
for the inducing any one so to judge of his measures, viz. That those
Conclusions were never concluded and defined by any compleat General Council to
belong to the Pope's Authority: and their own School Doctors are at irrecon|cileable
odds and jarrs about them. He had then his Eye on the Lateran
Council as appears by the other words there in the Margent, viz. Touching
the PRETENDED Council of LATERAN, See Plat. in vit Innocen. 3. and
by which Council the King knew that all except two or three of those Con|clusions
were concluded and defined. If therefore many of the poor pet|ty
School-Doctors were so searless of the Papal Thunder, as in Cases
when they were perhaps unconcerned to impeach the Papal Usurpation,
there was no cause of apprehension in that our wise Monarch that any of
his High-born Heirs and Successors would ever favour the Usurpations of
that Authority.
When Queen Elizabeth was so firmly satisfied concerning the Loyalty
of the Roman Catholick Lords Temporal, and of their great Quota in
the balance of the Kingdom securing their abhorrence of all Papal Usur|pations,
as not to impose the Oath of Supremacy on them, (tho yet She
took care to have it imposed on the Popish Bishops) can we imagine
that the great Interest of an Heir of the Crown in the Hereditary Monar|chy,
did not give a Plerophoy of satisfaction to that Great Monarch,
that such an Heir would never permit any Usurpation to prejudice his
Crown Imperial?
Moreover if in the Case of the device of an Inheritance by Will on
the Condition of the Legatees not holding this or that Philosophical or
Religionary Tenet, the absurdity of such Condition would not frustrate
the device, but would be taken as Pro non adject, and that thus in that
known Case in the Digest, viz. Of an Heir made on an absurd Condition,
namely, On Condition he should throw the Testators ashes into the Sea, the
Heir was rather to be commended than any way questioned who forbore to do
so, how can we think in the Inheritance of the Crown (which is from
God and by inherent Birth-right) any such supposed absurd Condition of a
Prince's not believing this or that Speculative Religionary Tenet, (and for his
professing of which he hath a dear bought Liberty by the ,

or the New Testament of Iesus Christ) should be intended to operate to his
prejudice?
But that I may in a word perimere litem about that Kings never intend|ing
the least prejudice to the Succession, by any of his Successors being Ro|man
Catholicks, I shall observe that that Kng who was so great and skill|ful
an Agonist, for the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England,
did yet in the Articles of the proposed Match with Spain, and afterwards
with that of France, agree that the Children of such Marriage should no
way be compelled or constrained in point of Conscience or Religion, and that
their Title to the Crown should not be prejudiced, in Case it should please
God they should prove Roman Catholicks: and that the Laws against Ca|tholicks
should not in the least touch them. And that the sense of the Go|vernment
then was likewise to that effect avowedly declared, is manifest
from the Passages of those times: and the needless quarrel therefore that
our late Excluders would have exposed us to with France, was a thing
worthy their considering.
But enough of this Conclusion, if not too much: for where the Tide
of the Words of any Oath runs strong and clear, we need not to regard the
Wind of any Law-givers intention: however yet I have made it appear
for the redundant satisfaction of the scrupulous, that while they have
embarqued their Consciences in thse Oaths they have had such
Wind and Tide both together on their side: and that therefore any
Storms which the Takers of these Oaths relating to the Lineal Succession
of the Crown may have raised either in their Consciences or the State,
must be supposed to be very unnatural.
Having thus in the foregoing Conclusions asserted and proved the Obliga|tion
relating to the Kings Heirs and Successors, as resulting from the Oaths
of Allegiance and Supremacy, I shall briefly answer such objections thereun|to
or rather Scruples, (for they deserve not the name of Objections) as some
noisy Nominal Protestants have troubled themselves and others with, and
so end this Casuistical Discussion.
The first Objection or Scruple then I shall take notice of that some
have raised against the Obligation of these Oaths as above asserted,
is that they were made in relation to Papists only, and were enjoyned
to be taken for the discovery of those that were suspected to be so.
As to which it will be sufficient to say, that it is most plain that all Per|sons
who have taken these or any other lawful Oaths, are bound by Deeds
to fullfil what they have sworn in Words: and it is an absurd thing to
doubt whether the Law intended that those Persons should observe the
Oaths, whom it hath enjoyned to take them. And to this purpose we
are well taught by Bishop Sanderson in his 6th Lecture of Oaths That
tho Papal Vsurpation was the cause of the Oath of Supremacy, (the arro|gating
to himself the exercise of Supreme Iurisdiction in spiritualibus,
throughout this Kingdom) yet the Oath is Obligatory according to the ex|press
words in the utmost Latitude: the reson is, that the intention of a
Law is general to provide against all Future inconveniences of the like kind
or nature, c. I refer the Reader to him there at large.
By the Measures of that Bishop as to the Oath of Supremacy, we like|wise
may direct our selves in the Oath of Allegiance being Obligatory ac|cording
to the express words in the utmost Latitude, tho that Oath was
made by occasion of the Gun-powder Treason.
And as to the intent of the Oath of Supremacy, King Iames tells us in
his Apology for the Oath of Allegiance, p. 108. That it was to prop up the

Power of Christian Kings as Custodes utrusque tabae, by com|manding
Obedience to be given to the word of God, and by reforming Reli|gion
according to his prescribed Will, by assisting the spiritual Power with
the Temporal Sword, c. by procuring due Obedience to the Church, by judg|ing
and cutting off all frivolous Questions and Schisms as Constantine did,
and finally by making Decorum to be observed in every thing, and Esta|lishing
Orders to be observed in all indifferent things, c. whereby his
Majesty doth clearly denote the intention of that Oath to have been to
extend against any Non-Conformists continuing their Schism in the
Church.
And as to the Oath of Allegiance being intended against Protestants as
well as Papists making a Faction in the State, the Book called God and the
King, compiled and printed by King Iames's Authority, sufficiently shews
throughout, by the Notification of the particular Moral Offices re|quired
by the Oath of Allegiance, and likewise by his Subjects na|tural
Allegiance, and which Moral Offices are there strengthened
with passages out of the Scriptures and Fathers: and the Doctrine
of absolute Loyalty is there well Established, and likewise the Doctrine
of Resistance overthrown, and the Scope of the Book is to plant Loyalty
throughout the Kingdom: and to make the Oath of Allegiance be re vr
a Premuniment in all mens Consciences against Faction and Rebellion.
The Sect of King Iames's old Enemies in Scotland the Puritans, and
whom he said he found there more dishonest than the Highlanders and Border
Thieves, is not named in that Book; and he having cleared them from
being participants in the Gun-powder Treason, did with Justice as well as
perhaps with hopes of their emendation after the Tenets of Loyalty that
had been then lately published by the English Non-Conformists, order
that Sect not to be in that Book marked Nigro carbone. But he could
not but know their former Principles as well as Practices here as exactly
as any one: and in his Canons here published a Year before the Gun-powder
Treason, The impugners of the Rites and Ceremonies in the Church of
England were variously censured; the Authors of Schism in the Church of
England were censured by the 9th Canon, and the maintainers of Schisma|ticks
by the 10th, and by the 27th Schismaticks were not to be admitted to
the Communion. The maintainers of Conventicles were censured by the 11th,
and the maintainers of Constitutions made in Cnventicles censured by the
12th: and it refers to the wicked and Anabaptistical Errors of some who
outraged the King's Supremacy and Regal Rights, and who did meet and
make Rules and Orders in Causes Ecclesiastical without the King's Autho|rity:
and therefore as the King knew that such Persons who had made
Schisms in the Church had thereby made Factions in the State, and
would make more (the Church being necessarily included in the State)
and would be as dry Tider ready to take the Fire of Rebellion from
such Republican Tenets as were in Parson's Book of the Succession, and
the Writings of Bellarmine and other Romanists, and being justly appre|hensive
that such Antimonarchical Principles as had infected the Scotch
Puritans might in time infect the English ones, as well as that the Prin|ciples
of the Powder-Traitors might infect other Loyal Papists, he appli|ed
the Oath of Allegiance as a general necessary Antidote to the Conscien|ces
of his Subjects to prevent such infection.
In p. 109. of his Apology for the Oath of Allegiance, he cited Bellarmine
for the Tenets, That Kings have not their Authority nor Office immediately
from God, and that Kings may be deposed by their People for divers respects;

and when such Writers did so spitefully with the Papal Power endeavour
likewise to bring in the Sea of the People to overwhelm Kings, it was
time to raise the Bank of that Oath the higher against the same, and for
the Takers of that Oath to be obliged to bear Faith and True Allegiance
to his Majesty, his Heirs, c. and him and them to defend, c. against all
Conspiracies, c. which shall be made against his or their Persons, their
Crown and Dignity, by reason or colour of any such Sentence or Declaration or
OTHERWISE, and to declare that neither the Pope, NOR ANY PERSON
WHATSOEVER hath Power to absolve them of this Oath.
When therefore I see any serious man disloyal, who hath took the Oath
of Allegiance, and whom Necessity (as we say) doth not draw to Turpitude,
I still attribute much of his disloyalty to his not with intense and recol|lected
thought dwelling on the view of his Moral Obligations in the
clear Mirror of that Oath, but to his cursory viewing them, and, as
St. Iames's words are like a man beholding his natural face in a Glass, but be|holdeth
himself and goeth his way, and straitway forgetteth what manner of
man he was. How many outragious Acts of Disloyalty after 41 had been
avoided if the Law of the Oath had been writ in the hearts of the Takers
of it as it ought to have been? As for Example, since to Prorogue or
Dissolve Parliaments was ever a known Right and Privilege belonging
to the Crown, could any Person who had sworn to defend its Rights and
Privileges endeavour to retrench that particular one by the Act for the
perpetuating the Parliament of 40? How easie would Princes find their
Reigns, and Subjects their Consciences, if these would think of all the
Royal Rights they have sworn to defend, and how they are to defend
them?
I have mentioned the great Law of Athens against any ones bearing
Office under an Usurpt Power, and the terrible Oath for the confirma|tion
of that Law, and I have likewise mentioned the Author of the EX|ERCITATION,
and Mr. Prynn as asserting the unlawfulness of bearing
Office under our late usurp'd Powers by reason of the Oath of Allegiance
having before obliged them to the King, his Heirs and Successors. The
Author of the Exercitation doth very appositely to strengthen that his
Loyal Assertion cite an excellent passage out of Tully's Epistles ad Atti|cum,
viz. of his doubting the lawfulness of his bearing the Office of a
Councellor of State in such a Case: Ec magnum sit ,
veniendumne sit in Consilium Tyranni, si is aliqu de re bon
deliberaturus sit. Quare si quid ejusmodi evenerit ut accersamur, quid censeas
mihi faciendum utique scribito. Nihil enim mihi adhuc accidit quod majo|ris
Consilii est. And the truth is, the great thing that inclineth so
many to desire Changes in Governments, being the hopes of the Acquest
of Offices, it was but natural for the Athenian Wisdom to fence with
sharp precaution against the lusciousness of Authority under an Usurper,
and to let every man know (as I may say) in terrorem, that in the day
of his eating the forbidden fruit, he would die the death by the hand of
every man and for the wisdom of the Government in King Iames's time
by the effect and necessary Consequences of the Clauses in the Oath of Al|legiance
to tye mens Consciences from supporting any Vsurpation by bearing
Office under it.
That Law and Oath of Athens were no doubt as almost all other
matters of Learning known to King Iames; and could he have foreseen
how the guest after Offices occasioned the Demagogues to promote the
ebellion of 41, (for 'tis known they were then mighty Nimrods after

mighty Offices in the State and after what particular ones) and how the
several Vsurpations supported themselves here afterward through mens
supporting themselves by Offices under them, and how in this present
Fermentation men have been tempted to Faction by hopes of Offices (and
in pursuit of which men were never generally so wary as i this Conjun|cture)
I am apt to think that in uberorem cautelam for Loyalty, and the
making men appear perjured even to all of the grossest understandings,
who should bear Office under any Vsurper, and consequently deterring
them from projecting to altr the Hereditary Government, he would
have inserted into the Oath a particular express Clause of not bearing
Office here under any other.
But further to illustrate the intent of the Government in King Iames's
time for making the Oath of Allegiance a Praemuniment in our Conscien|ces
against Popular as well as Papal Usurpations, I shall here call in, Testi|monium
adversarii, I mean the publisher of Cardinal Perron's long Ora|tion
made in the Chamber of the 3d Estate, or Commonalty of France up|on
the Oath of Allegiance exhibited in the General Assembly of the three
Estates of that Kingdom and in his long Preface to which he calls our Oaths
of Supremacy and Allegiance detestable; but saith, That the greater number
of the Deputies of the 3d Chamber did frame the form of an Oath which
they wished might be ministred in that Kingdom, as that which bears the
name of ALLEGIANCE in ours, whereby the same principal Article is ab|jured,
namely, That no French King can be deposed for any Cause whatsoever,
and that the contrary Opinion is Heretical, and repugnant to the Doctrine of
the Scriptures. But this difference is found between the two Oaths: that
whereas the English one in one of the Clauses, seems to exclude not only the
Authority of the CHVRCH over Kings, but even of the COMMON-WEALTH
also (yea tho it should be accompanied even with that of the
Church) that of France shoots only at the abnegation of the Churches Autho|rity.
The Author however in that Preface (and which was Permiss supe|riorum)
contrary to the Loyal Sentiments of the Majority of that 3d
Chamber, inserts very impiously and disloyally, That Kingly Authority
cannot come immediately from God to any man, but by Miracle: and that all
the Kings whom we know, do either rule by force of Conquest, and in that
Case the Authority of the Common-wealth, if it be Vsurped, may be resu|med,
or by Donation, Election, Marriage, or Succession of Blood, in which
Cases Kings forfeit by not performing the Conditions, under which either they
or their first Ancestors did enter, whether they were expressed or necessarily
implyed.
But neither that Author nor any other Roman Catholick Writer hath
writ with greater Contempt of and Spight against the Power of Kings,
than some Nominal Protestant Authors have to the scandal of Christi|anity
done: and that I may shew how necessary it was that the Oath of
Allegiance should be levelled at the outragious Principles of Disloyalty
in Protestants as well as Papists, I shall conclude my Answer to this Ob|jection
with a reference to a Book of some vile Nominal Protestants, who
having according to the Bishop of Winchester's Expression aforesaid, de|rived
Doctrines of Sedition and Rebellion from the Church of Rome's Wri|ters,
were (I may add) grown therein perhaps more learned than their
Masters. It was printed in 8^o beyond Sea in the Year 1556. and called, A
short Treatise of Politick Power, and of the true Obedience which Subjects

owe to Kings and other Civil Governors, with an Exhortation to all true
English men, Compiled by

D. I. P. B. R. W.
Who the Authors of it were, I know not, nor the meaning of those
initial Letters of Names: but do judge it to be in Principles of Sedition
and Treason as bad as Doleman of the Succession or Mariana, and to have
startled King Philip and Queen Mary as much as the Book of Killing no
Murder did Cromwel. I never in the Course of my viewing Books saw
but one of them, and the Reader will quickly see why no Library durst
in the Reign of those Princes harbor it. 'Tis there asserted, That the
Body of every State may redress and correct the Vices of their Governors,
and ought so to do. And the Book endeavours to prove the lawfulness
of killing Tyrants by the Law of Nature, and prophaneth the Book of
God by citing for a desperate use some extraordinary Acts of private Per|sons
there recorded: and indeed a loyal man cannot read the Book
without horror; and especially when he shall consider what were the
effects of this detestable Book. It helped to provoke the fury of Philip
and Mary to flie out into the Arbitrary Proclamation several Months be|fore
her death, for the declaring of any one a Rebel, and being without
delay executed by Martial Law, with whom that and other Books of
that Nature printed beyond Sea should here be found. And another ef|fect
of the publication of that and those other Books was to irritate the
Government against those poor Innocents who were here martyr'd, and
who sufficiently abhorred such Treasonable Books: for this Book was
published beyond Sea, and probably imported here about two years be|fore
her death. But for the honour of our English Exiles then, I judge
that none of them had a hand therein: I having observed many Words,
and Idioms and Phrases there to have been Scotish.
It is probable that King Iames and his Ministers had heard of this exe|crable
Book, wherein some Nominal Protestants trumpetted out their Prin|ciples
of real Rebellion; and no wonder then if the Oath of Allegiance
was therefore framed with Clauses to secure the Government from all
irreligionary Principles of Protestants as well as Papists.
It hath been objected in the second place against our being become bound
to the Kings Heirs and Successors by Virtue of those Oaths, that it is
by all Casuists agreed that among the Tacit Conditions that are presumed
to be in all Oaths (and which are to be regarded as much as if they were
express'd) Rebus sic stantibus is one: and that that therefore as none of
the King's Heirs was then excluded from the Privilege or Right of his Li|neal
Succession by the Legislative Power, so if things thus stood with him
at the time of the Descent of the Crown, that is, at the time of the Kings
decease, the Oath obliged to the payment of absolute and irrespective
Loyalty to him then: and that thus when the King's Heirs and Succes|sors
were Kings and Queens of this Realm according to the Style of some
old Oaths, they would be Entitled to our Allegiance, and not other|wise.
In Answer to this Objection, I shall say first, that if we should admit
that which is not true, that the Rebus sic stantibus were so to be applied in
this Case, yet it is most clear that the Takers of these Oaths who were any
Members of the Three Estates in Parliament were thereby ipso facto, and

actually bound (as I have said in the 7t Conclusion) not to do any Act
there to exclude the Succession according to proximity of Blood: and
moreover any of the People who took these Oaths were thereby Moral|ly
bound not to choose any to represent them in Parliament from whom
they might fear their endeavouring of such Exclusion.
Secondly, Premising that there was somewhat of irreverence in supposing
that the Legislative Power would ever afterward make a Solutio contiui,
(as I called it) in the Hereditary Monarchy, yet it must be said that
any supposed Act of that kind would be Null and Void, as the Loyal and
Learned late Writers of the Succession have shewed, and to whose
Writers of that Subject I refer: and therefore our Obligations to
the King's Heirs and lawful Successors by Virtue of these Oaths
must remain uncancelled in the Court of Conscience: and however any
Act of Parliament supposed to be made against the Law of God, may a
while be de facto received in any Courts of Law, yet is it in the Court of
Conscience to be looked on as a poor Escrole, and as not worthy the name
of a Law.
It is most manifest that by these Oaths, there is jus alteri acquisitum, I
mean to the King's Heirs and Successors, as well as to the King; and that
therefore any supposed relaxation of the Oaths without the consent of all
Parties for whose behoof they were made, is a thing Nugatory and not
allowable in the Court of Conscience.
And as I have speaking cum vulgo called some Anti-Papists, whose
Principles tend to Faction in the State and Schism in the Church, Nominal
Protestants (tho yet I should be still as much content with any Law
that made it Penal to call them Protestants, as with one that should be so to
call Quacks Physicians) so I should in the Court of Conscience call any Acts
of Parliament that are contrary to the Eternal and Natural Rules of indis|pensable
Iustice, only Nominal Laws, suitably to what is said in the ad|mirable
Preface of Aerodius his Rerum Iudicatarum Pandect: viz. Quod
si quid iniqu, malo more, sordibus,  adversus illm sempiternam legem
atque immutabilem, hic aut illic judicatum, tranactum sit, qualis fuit apud
Graecos Socratis, Phocionis, apud Romanos Mtelli Numidici, Rutili Rufi,
M. Ciceronis damnatio; in ecclesi Flaviani, Johannis Chrysostomi: con|tr
absolutio P.  Sexti Clodiorum, atque adeo Gabinii, quam proptere
legem impunitatis appellarunt, non magis judicata aut decreta debent appellari,
quam Seiae, Apuleae,  Liviae leges. Leges non sunt inquit Cicero.
But Thirdly, The just allowance of the Rebus sic stantibus that can be
in this Case is this, there being nothing of pretence of relaxation from
all Parties supposeable, these Oaths bind us to the King's Heirs and Succes|sors,
as long as there is any ONE of them remaining in the World: and
without the insertion of the words in the Oath of Allegiance, viz. I do be|lieve
and in Conscience am resolved that neither the Pope NOR ANY PER|SON
WHATSOEVER hath Power to absolve me of this Oath or any part
thereof, its indispensableness to those who know the Obligation of Oaths to
be jure Divino naturali, would have sufficiently appeared. In fine, there are
Rationes boni  mali aeternae  indispensabiles, and to stand to promises
is one of the things that are simply and in their own nature good, and
it is impossible (as the Scripture saith) That God should lye, and there|fore
man made after God's image, must therein answer the Archetype: and
hereby our Princes have the Garranty of our Allegiance sworn to them,
their Heirs and Successors being indispensable by Popes, or Acts of Par|liament,
or by God himself: for he cannot dispense with the Law of Na|ture,
Human natur manente eadem.

Lastly, It is most manifest from what I have already said, that any
such Tacit Condition in these Oaths as before mentioned, was contrary
to the sense of the Imposer as well as to the Words, and was therefore not
allowable in the Court of Conscience in this Case: and I believe that the
Consciences of such who have made this Objection, must tell them, that
when they took these Oaths, their sense of them was then contrary to
any such condition being allowed. And therefore any such After-birth
of a strained Interpretation being so contrary to the Law of God and the
Land, and the sense of the Imposer, as well as the words of the Oaths,
and to the sense in which they actually took them, must be thrown
away.
There hath been a third Objection, if it may be called one, or if yet
it may be called a Scruple, for I think it hardly deserves the name of that.
However it having got under some mens feet, or into their heads, it hath
made them so uneasie as frowardly to trample on the Rights of Crown'd
Heads, and it hath troubled us by the name of Haeres viventis, and as
if that were a Chymaera, when as indeed the Objection is altogether Chy|merical.
When Sir L. I. had with so much clear reason shewed much to this
purpose, viz. That the Exclusion-Bill was against the Fundamental Iu|stice
as likewise the wisdom of the Nation, and that it would induce a
CHANGE in the Government: and that was likewise against the Religion
of the Nation which teacheth us, That Dominion is not founded in Grace,
and that we are to pay Obedience to Princes whether good or bad, as according|ly
the Primitive Christians did, and that it was against the Oaths of the Na|tion,
namely, of Allegiance and Supremacy: and that his R. H. is the
King's lawful Heir, if he hath no Child, and in the Eye of the Law we are
sworn to him, and when he had further signalized the weight of his Poli|tical
Remarks, and Learning in that Speech as well of as his Loyalty, so as
on the account of both to merit a place for it in the English Story, and
had instanced in some Princes and their Subjects of different Religions li|ving
very happily together, it may perhaps be a blot in that Story, that
Sir W. I. in an answer to that Speech granting, That we are sworn to the
King, his Heirs and Successors, said further, That we are not obliged to any
during the King's life, but to himself: for it were Treason if it were other|wise.
The King hath no Heirs nor Successors during his life: for according
to his Law (meaning Sir L. I's) and ours, Nemo est haeres viven|tis.
In answer to which, I shall say that that Proverbial Latin saying in the
Law Books doth amount to no more in nature, and hath no more in|fluence
on Humane Affairs, nor particularly on Moral Offices, than that
kind of Proverbial Sayings in the New Testament, viz. For where a Testa|ment
is, there must also of necessity be the death of the Testator, or a
Testament is of no strength while the Testator liveth. Every one knoweth
that a Will is in its own nature revocable, and Legatees and Executors
may be altered by the Testator: and for any one to quote it as a Maxim,
Nemo est Executor viventis (and for a Legatee, or in effect an Execu|tor
in a Will, the word haeres i often used in the Civil Law and by the
Writers of it) will be no more significant, than the telling the Legatee
or Executor is, that they must not meddle in the Testators Goods till
he be dead: and it may usefully operate to divert People from the
slothful Omissions of making their Wills in due time, out of a fond ima|gination
that their Legatees or Executors would have a Title to any thing
before the Testators death.

But after what hath been said of the revocableness of Wills, if I
have lawfully sworn to continue such a man my Heir, or Executor of my
Will or Legatee therein, can I then at my pleasure with a Salvo to Con|science
alter it therein? And if a Father hath sworn to give his Children
such a part of his Estate by his Will, as by the Civil Law is due to them
out of his Estate when he dies, shall he then be allowed in the Court
of Conscience to alter such bequest Ad libitum? This comes a little
home to our Case: for we have before hand sworn to pay the King's
Heirs at the Descent of the Crown the Allegiance that will be due to
them then by inherent Birthright.
St. Paul writing to the Romans alludes to that Custom of the Roman
Laws, and which is yet retained in Germany and many other places, viz. And
if Children, then Heirs, and makes them certainly Haeredes viventis: and
when any by the Civil Law were Haeredes ab intestato, or Heirs at Law,
that Law as it made no difference between Land and Goods, so neither
did it between Eldest and Youngest, nor Male and Female, but divided the
whole Estate real and personal, equally among the Children; and the
Law tying Parents to leave a Quota in their Wills to their Children,
St. Paul's Consequence was good, i. e. if Children, then Heirs. We know
that the Heirs of our Kings are not such as that Law called Haeredes
Testamentarii, but they succeeding by the right Divine and Inherent
Birthright, may be said to be Haeredes legitimi, and when in the King's
Life-time the Law hath enjoyned men by a Liquid Oath to defend all Pri|vileges,
Preheminences belonging to the King's Heirs and Successors, can it be
either Law or Sense to say they are now no Heirs, and that any who have
taken that Oath may actually exclude such Heirs because they are not
actual Successors, and as if too none could be a Successor but an actual
one, according to that old Dicterium, That no Prince ever put to death his
Successor?
But to shew further how grosly Sir W. I. was mistaken in his inter|pretation,
and applying of the saying out of the Civil Law, viz. Nemo
est haeres viventis, I shall refer to Paulus de Castro (as Eminent a Commen|tator
on the Civil Law as any one whatsoever) who doth on the Digest
De liberis  Posthumis. l. Gallus . etiam n. 3^o  4^t^o discuss the point
of Haeres viventis, and where he saith, Nota quod filius vel alius descen|dens
in potestate patris, qui tenet primum locum dicitur esse suus haeres etiam
vivente patre; and then objects the saying, That Vivens non habet haere|dem,
ergo non suum haeredem: and he answers, That istud verbum HAE|RES
idem significat quod DOMINVS, c.  potest sumi duobus modis
1^o propri prout est Successor in Vniversum jus quod defunctus habuit (mean|ing
haeres as the same with an Executor by the Law of England)  isto
modo vivens non potest habere haeredem. 2^d^o Sumitur strict, c.  im|propri
pro filio vel nepote, vel alio descendente qui teneat primum locum in
suitate  isto modo vivens potest habere haeredem; sicut enim filius VI|VENTE
patre dicitur DOMINVS bonorum paternorum licet impropri,
it a potest dici HAERES prout istud verbum sumitur pro Domino. He had
before spoke of the General Rule, That Haeres suus dicitur quem nemo
praecedit, and he there mentions what likewise all the Books agree in,
That Haeredes sui  necessarii dicuntur liberi qui in famili proximum  pa|tre
gradem obtinent: sui, quia haereditatem tanquam suam, necessarii quia
jure antiquo retinere cogebantur. He intends there (I suppose) by the
jus antiquum that Law of the 12 Tables, viz. Intestatorum haeredes prim suo|rum
haeredum velint nolintve sunto.

We find in the New Testament such Heir judged to be Lord of all,
Gal. 4. 1. And thus Grotius on that place in the Hebrews, whom he hath
appointed Heir of all things saith, That by Heir is meant Lord, Nam
 Latinis Haeres idem quod herus. Christus in coelum evectus, rerum om|nium
est Dominus;  patre scilicet hoc jure accepto. The very Institutes
likewise tell us . ult. De haered. qualit. That pro haerede gerere, est pro
Domino gerere: veteres enim haeredes pro Dominis appellabant. And such
Lords of all then were the Heirs, that tho ordinarily they could not
have their Legitima pars in their Fathers life-time (and so we find it but
in the Parable in St. Luke that the Prodigal Son said, Father give me the
Portion of Goods that falleth to me, and he divided unto them his Living)
yet if the Father were re ver a Prodigal, the Son might by imploring
the Office of the Judge obtain in the Fathers life-time somewhat like
the legitima to be allowed for his subsistance. And moreover Grotius on
the other place of Scripture, Si autem filii  haeredes, saith, Sententia
est conveniens non tantum Israelitico Numerorum 28. sed etiam Gentium
juri. Nam lex quaedam tacita liberis haereditatem parentum addicit. L.
Cum initio. ff. De bonis damnatorum. Sed magis est ut jus Hebraeum respex|erit
Paulus, ideque  hic sunt  filii, non quod non utrique sexui
Christianorum aptari possint quae dicit, sed quod jure Mosis filii necessari hae|edes,
filiae non nisi filiis deficientibus.
None need therefore wonder at De Castro's having pronounced the
Heir to be the same thing with Dominus, and at his leaving it out of
doubt that direct Descendants are a mans Heirs in his life-time, because
they are such as are called Heirs at Law. And there is little room for
doubting here in England who are Heirs at Law to private Persons, for
Sir Edward Coke hath to this purpose said that throughout his time, viz.
Ne duas quidem quaestiones adverti de jure haereditatum: but God be thank|ed
there can be no room for any in the Case of the Crown.
King Iames when he Erected the Monument for his Mother on the
Northside of her Grand-father Harry the 7th's Tomb, and put these
words in the Inscription, viz. Coronae Angliae dum vixit certae  indubi|tatae
haeredis, necessarily implied that there was another Sovereign li|ving
while She was thus Heir to the Crown.
Let any one consider how many real Solecisms Sir. W. I's. imagined one
must occasion. Is it not a Solecism to say, I cannot now promise a future
lawful thing, viz. Allegiance to the King's Heirs at the time of the De|scent
of the Crown, since nothing can be promised but what is Future?
In the Body of the Civil Law matters of right are sometimes founded
on trite Philosophical Axioms and such as Non entis, nulla sunt acciden|tia:
but it were a Solecism to deny, that the Takers of these Oaths have
become bound at that time to the Haeredes viventis, who were then non|dum
vivi, or that a Lessee is bound at the perfecting of his Lease, to pay
his Rent to the Heirs of the Lessor tho then not in nature. If the Style
of the King of the Romans, can in an Elective Government, and during
the Emperors life be, Ego N. Rex Romanorum futurus Imperator, is
not the next Heir of the Crown in an Hereditary Monarchy to be styled
the certain and undoubted Heir of the Crown as long as he lives?
I find not the term of apparent joyned to Heir in any Books of Law or
History but of our Country: but God making Heirs, and especially the
Heirs of Crowns, the inherent Birth-right by Proximity of Blood is the
id ipsum to be regarded: and if Haeres viventis QVATENVS such
must be a Solecis according to Sir W. I's. insinuation, then the Quotation

usually brought out of Sir E. Coke by Writers of this Subject, That the Heir
apparent is Heir before the death of his Ancestor, must be a Solecism too,
according to the known Rule in Logick of A quatenus ad omne, c.
I shall studiously avoid the embarassing the Question with needless
Points of Law: and do consider, that i in Courts of Law we are above the
Apices verborum, we are much more above them in the Court of Consci|ence.
And here I must say it, that if in the interpretation of Princes sa|vours
and Concessions we are allowed to go by the Rule that in them Ex|uberantior
fides requiritur, and that therefore promissio in dignitate Regali
fact, aequipollet juramento, and that a Sovereign Prince appealed to about
the Rights of Subjects is Morally bound to proceed therein Vt DEVS
qui soli veritati innititur, and according to the Style of the Judges dele|gated
by Sovereign Princes, Sol rei veritate inspect, and throwing off the
Formal Rules and Solemnities even of positive Laws themselves; it may
be well inferred that the Divine Law of Nature obliging us to Gratitude,
we are Morally bound in the preservations of the Lives and Rights of
Princes (tho we had not been sworn to them, yet) to regard them as God,
and not to obscure their Rights with Formalities and subtilties of Law,
and much less with tricks of words, but especially in the interpretation
of our Oaths to them to use the greatest simplicity therein that is sutable
to the Law of Nations, Nature and Christianity, and to abhor what the
Lawyers call a Subdola juris interpretatio, and what may be called, as the
expression is in Iob, a darkening of Council by words without knowledge,
and a gloss that corrupts the Text, and is directly contrary to the Right
of Kings and Princes; for the securing of which and removing all doubts
or strife about the same these Oaths were made.
And should any one tell me of the effect of that saying Nemo est haeres
viventis in our Common-Law, and that Land being given to A. for life
and the remainder to the Heirs of B. and that A. dying while B. lives
who hath at that time a Son, that Son shall never have the Land because
of Non est haeres viventis, but it shall go back to the Donor if alive, or if
dead to his Heirs, I will ask him if the Donor should be bound in Justice
and Equity by a certain future time to Lett the Heirs of B. have the Land,
and had voluntarily sworn that B's Heirs should then have the same, whe|ther
the Donor then could with a Salvo to Conscience keep the Son or
other Heir from the same by Virtue of the Non est haeres viventis? But
we are to be tender how we compare the Inheritances of private Persons
with that of the Crown, which is of a higher Nature, and without a
Metaphor differs from them Toto Coelo, and is so much above them. And
how regardless were they then of the Birth-right of the oldest Monarchy
in the World, and particularly of the present Glorious Royal Line, that
would not allow it the Privilege of being plainly understood as they do
to private Inheritances, and as to which William the Conqueror in that
part of his Charter to London is allowed to speak intelligibly enough, viz.
And I wyll that ich Child be his Faders Eyer.
But I am weary of this Wild-goose chace of the Haeres viventis among
old Books: and my pointing back any one to my 3d and 5th Conclusions
may save my labour of speaking here much more of it, It is sufficiently
set forth in the third, in what sense the words of Oaths are to be taken, and
where I mentioned Ames saying, That they are regularly to be taken in
that sense that the words have in the COMMON use of men. And to this
purpose we are well told by Vaughan in Shepbard and Gosnald's Case, That
were the penning of a Statute is dubious, long usage is a just Medium to ex|pound

it by: for jus  norma loquendi is governed by usage, and the mean|ing
of things spoke or writ must be as it hath constantly been received to be
by common acceptation. But I have shewed the word Heir to be no doubt|ful
word: and as I have mentioned it to be a word that the Glory and
Power of our Saviour is expressed by, I may add that our Noble Privi|lege
as we are Christians being so often represented in Scripture by the
word Heirs, c. we are Morally bound to guard the word from the
Assault of any new interpretation that would outrage it with doubt and
ambiguity.
I have shewed that as our Oath is part of a Statute-Law, if there
could be any doubt of it, the Iudges are to interpret it: and our Ancestors
were so far from trusting private men to interpret Statutes, that they
have not allowed the Court Christian judicially interpret the very Sta|tutes
that concern the things there conusable. And as some Papists do
vainly sometime tell us, That we by our Religion damn all our Popish An|cestors,
it may here with truth be said, that any by finding out a new sense
of the word Heirs do condemn the understandings of those and their
Morals in not observing the Oath by the measures of that interpretation;
and I may as truly say, that we venture on damning our selves by Perjury,
if while we venture on a new sense of the Oaths both contrary to the
common sense of the words and of the Imposer, we do not particularly
take the Oaths with our Protestation of that new sense, and much more
if reserving that new sense in our minds we shall further in one of these
Oaths, viz. That of Allegiance declare, That we have sworn every thing
therein according to the PLAIN and COMMON sense and VNDER|STANDING
of the same words without ANY Equivocation, or Mental Eva|sion,
or secret Reservation whatsoever.
It is a certain Rule about Oaths, That Iuramentum non extenditur ad ea
de quibus cogitatum non est: and so is this other, viz. Non licet nobis inter|pretatione
taci comminisci conditiones, nisi quae vel publico jure receptae
sunt, vel ex re ipsa, aut verbis quibusdam manifest colliguntur: and I
may add another, That Minim mutanda sunt quae interpretationem certam
semper habuerunt. But as it hath appeared to all a superfluous thing ever
to have the Judges consulted about any being Heirs to the King in his
life-time, and wherein there is no Dignus vindice nodus, so likewise tho
Contra captiones ex actu ambiguo nascentes, remedio est protestatio, quae de|claratione
intentionis actum madificatur, jus in posterum competens conservat,
yet no man was ever found so ridiculous as to make any Protestation at
the time of his taking these Oaths concerning this new sense of the
word Heirs: and what is a greater reflection on our Excluders as to their
Non-observance of the Promissory Clause relating to the King's Heirs,
is that the Excluders were embarqued in their Exclusion, and half-Sea
over in their prosecution of it, and had thrown away their Compass of
the common sense of the Oaths, before the new one of Haeres viventis
was found or heard of, an interpretation that I believe the very Author
of the Sheriffs Case would have held scandalous, and which indeed
amounts not to so much as a Scruple of Conscience, or to more than a
Quirk of Law. It hath long been the Custom of Spain not to make any
men Iudges who have been Advocates, as supposing that their straining
the Law as Practitioners for their Clients, might make them the less
Candid in their Judgment of the Law on the Tribunal: but the truth is,
the giving Judgment in the Court of Conscience, that this new-found inter|pretation
of the word Heirs would in that Court indemnify the Ta|kers

of the Oaths, may well seem unworthy of the dignity of any
Iudge or Counsellor or conscientious Attorney, and any one of those
whom the old Comaedian calls the Leguleiorum faeces decemdrachmari,
not wholly steer'd by Trick.
As great a Iudge in that Court as ever our Nation, or perhaps Christen|dom
bred, I mean our Bishop Sanderson, having in his 2d Lecture of Oaths
said, That we become guilty of the hainous Crime of Perjury, if a milder in|terpretation
of an Oath chance to deceive us, doth well mind us of the pro|fitable
Rule which in doubtful matters commands the choice of the safer
part. And thus the Casuists generally giving us that Rule, that in all
doubtful matters we are to incline to the safer side, and that therein 'tis
safer to think a thing to be Sin than not, and in order to the great
EXCLVSION of Perjury telling us, That Cum de ancipiti perjurio in fu|turum
quaeritur, illa est benignior sententia quae Conscientiae tutior, atque ita
quae crimen interpretatur ut excludat, and that when ever we recede from
the literal sense of an Oath to the intention of the Law-giver, we ought
to be very sure of that intention, if we will be sae from the danger of
Perjury, I think that new interpretation so clearly contrary both to the
literal sense of the Oath and the intention of the Law-giver (as I have
shewn) was a very unsafe trick for men to put upon their Conscien|ces.
But as the word Heir is a plain word, so it is likewise as plain, that
some men by the Haeres viventis would put a Trick on the State:
for let any one go to dissect all the meaning that can be in the Haeres
viventis in plain English, and it will be neither better nor worse than to
make the sense of the Imposer of the Oaths be, that men should observe
the Promissory Clauses relating to the King's Heirs and Successors only
on the terms of the Objection of Rebus sic stantibus, which I have before
mentioned and fully answered.
Nor can any men evade their being by the Oaths obliged to defend the
Rights of the Hereditary Monarchy, and thus prop up such their new
interpretation of Heirs by Virtue of the expired Statute of the 13th of
Elizabeth (which some have raised such dust with) that made it Treason to
affirm, That the Laws and Statutes do not bind the Right of the Crown and
its Descent, Limitation, Inheritance, or Governance. It is not an expired
Statute, nor any one in being can make the Obligation of our Oaths to
the King's Heirs and Successors to expire. We were in Conscience, and
by the Law (which is by some termed Communis sponsio Regni) obliged be|fore
our Oaths taken to defend the Rights of the King's Heirs and Suc|cessors
in all just ways: but if any men should be so vain as to think
that we were not before obliged to them on the account of the Heredi|tary
Monarchy, yet it is most certain that an Oath doth often induce an
Obligation where there was none before: and we are not now consider|ing
what WAS Treason, but what IS Perjury. An Act of Parliament
may inflict the Vltimum supplicium, on that which perhaps is not Malum
in se, as for example, The Exportation of Wooll, tho when we have a
glut of it; nay, by the 28th of Harry the 8th, c. 7. touching the Suc|cession
of the Crown, the not taking of the contrary Oaths is made Trea|son.
But I need not here say more than that if any in the 13th Year of
Queen Elizabeth had took the Oath of Supremacy enjoyned in the first
Year of her Reign, and did not observe the Promissory Clause therein,
they did offend God and their Consciences thereby. But I have mention|ed
it that Arch-Bishop Hutton notwithstanding that 13th of Elizabeth

made it a Praemunire to speak of any Person being her Heir and Successor,
except the same were the natural Issue of her Body, did publickly in his
Sermon before her, discharge that Promissory part of the Oath by assert|ing
King Iames his Right to succeed her, and was publickly by her thank|ed
for it.
On the whole matter, we are not bound by these Oaths to look back|ward
on other mens actings, but to look forward on our own. Enough
has been said of too much that was done to oppose King Iames's Succes|sion,
and of the necessity of the Oath of Allgiance to secure England to
the Royal Line and by it: and the providing of the fortius vinculum on
the emergency of the Gun-powder Treason, was but sutable to the ge|neral
prudence of all States and the expression of Allegiance to be paid
to the King's Heirs and Successors, when Kings and Queens of this Realm,
which was in some former Oaths, was not in this necessary, nor yet in the
Oath of Supremacy, because of the great Fundamental Clause in both before
mentioned, viz. The King IS the only Supreme Governor, c. he IS ONLY
Supreme, and so none co-ordinate, or equal to him; our Sovreign Lord
the King, IS lawful and rightful King, c. and so the word IS must ne|cessarily
hinder any Heirs or Successors forestalling the Market if they
should presume before their time to come for our actual Allegiance, how|ever
sworn to them to be paid in future time.
Our Law-Book of Oaths mentions a long Promissory Oath made vo|luntarily
to Harry the 6th, by 2 Arch-Bishops, 16 Bishops, 3 Dukes, 5
Earls, 2 Viscounts, 14 Abbots, 2 Priors, and 7 Barons, and but part of
which I shall here set down, viz. I A. B. knowledge you most High and
Mighty and most Christian Prince King Henry 6. to be my most redoubted,
and rightwise by Succession born to Reign upon me, and all your Liege People,
whereupon I voluntarily without Coercion, promise and oblige me by the
faith and truth that I owe to God, and by the faith, truth and ligeance that
I owe to you my most redoubted Sovereign Lord, that I shall be without any
variance, true, faithful, humble, and obeysant Subject and Liege man, to you
my most redoubted Sovereign Lord, c. and swear to endeavour to do all
that may be to the weal and surety of your most Royal Person, c. to the weal,
surety, and preserving of the Person and benign Princess, Margaret Queen, my
Sovereign Lady, and of her High most Noble Estate, She being your Wife, and
also the weal, surety, and honour of the Person of the right High and Mighty
Prince Edward, my right redoubted Lord the Prince your first begotten Son,
and of the Right High and Noble Estate, and faithfully, truly, and obeysantly,
c. First, my Allegiance to you my most redoubted Sovereign Lord, during your
life, c. and if God of his infinite Power take you from this Transitory Life,
me bearing life in this World, that I shall then take and accept my said
redoubted Lord, the Prince Edward your said first born Son for my Sovereign
Lord, and bear my true Faith and Ligeance to him, as by nature born for
my Sovereign Lord, and after him to his Succession of his Body lawfully begot|ten,
c. and in default of his Succession, c. unto any other Succession of
your Body lawfully coming.
But the wisdom of any Nation making Laws (and especially about
Oaths) as short as may be, I account that those of Supremacy and Allegi|ance
have much better that Multi-loquious one (as I may call it) provi|ded
for the security of our Allegiance to the King Regnant, and afterward
to his Heirs and Successors, by plain and liquid words as far as Humane
Prudence could provide for the same. And because what is made by
Humane Art is in danger of being by Humane Art eluded, and for that

we see that Nature it self hath been made a Term of Art (a word that
St. Paul thought plain enough when he said doth not Nature teach us that,
c. yet of which word a late Lawyer and Kinsman of the Great Gro|tius
hath in his Book, De Principiis juris Naturalis told us of seven sig|nifications)
and for that it is as easie for a captious versatil Wit to turn
the word Heir or most words into as many or more, the Oath of Alle|giance
was further with deep precaution made to exterminate all cavilling
senses and calumnious interpretations, and such as that of the haeres viven|tis,
by that Final Clause which Crowns that Oath, and that which alone
as I partly hinted before amounts to an Oath, viz. And I do make this
Recognition and Acknowledgment heartily, willingly and truly upon THE
TRVE FAITH OF A CHRISTIAN, and after which it follows, So help
me God. That the Faith of a Christian alone amounts to an Oath, I shall
cite the opinion of Tuldenus the Regius Professor of Law at Lovain, when
writing De interpretatione Iuramenti, he saith, Affirmatio perfidem tunc demum
jusjurandum est, cum additum fuit Christianam. Alciat. in l. 41. c. De transact.
I conclude therefore that what Christian soever hath taken this Oath,
hath by Virtue of the words of The faith of a Christian obliged himself
thereby as much as if he had said, That Great Privilege of Birth-right be|longing
to the King's Heirs, a Privilege so great that the despising of it,
as in the Case of Esau is applied in Scripture to mens prophaneness in despi|sing
their Inheritance of Bliss by Christianity, I do as sincerely promise to
defend according to my Oath, and without any Fraud or Mental Reservation
or the least cavilling, capricious or calumnious interpretation, as I value
the great Privilege that Christianity hath ennobled Humane Nature with in
being Heirs of God and joynt Heirs with Christ as St. Pauls words are,
and of being Heirs according to the Promise; and may all the Divine Pro|mises
be so Yea and Amen to me, and interpreted with not only a plain but a
full and fair interpretation, and so likewise the very Oath of God, mentioned
in the Epistle to the Hebrews, As I do plainly, and fully, and fairly, and with
the exuberant honesty and simplicity enjoyn'd by the Christian Religion, and
so much transcending the Bona fides of the Heathen Morality, perform my
Promissory Oath of Allegiance to the King and his Heirs and Successors.
I shall in the last place take notice of what I have not without horror
observed, namely, that some disloyal Authors have presumed in Print to
pretend the lawfulness of Exclusion of Heirs and Successors on the ac|count
of their Religion, by colour of the punishment of Idolaters ac|cording
to the Iudicial Law: and as to which it will be sufficient here to
say, that that Law was given only to the Iewish Nation, and that it did
never bind any else or doth, and that the Divine Law natural and posi|tive
bind us to the Observation of our Oaths, and that Christianity doth
not found Dominion in Grace, and that the Patriarchs, and Ioshua, and the
Princes of the People of Israel made Leagues with Idolaters, and on
both sides there was mutual Faith confirmed with solemn Oaths, and
that an Oath Promissory to pay Allegiance to the Heirs of the Crown
at the time of its Descent is much more lawful.
And I might urge that the Iewish Kings tho often idolatrous, yet as
the Lord's Annointed had De jure  de facto Obedience payed them with|out
respect to their Religion, or Irreligion.
And by Virtue of the Moral Offices of honouring all men, and of the
Internal Communion due from all Christians to all Christians, I shall with|out
offending the Church I hold External Communion with, venture to
go as far in my Measures of Charity as some of its great Ornaments,

Dr. Hammond and Bishop Taylor and likewise Bishop Gunning have done in
freeing many Roman Catholicks from the guilt of Formal Idolatry. Innu|merable
Acts of Idolatry may be charged on many Persons of that Com|munion,
and particularly on all such as do worship the Cross or Saints and
Angels Cul latriae, and on such as in the Eucharist determine the
thoughts of their worship to the Consecrated Bread. But I believe there
are others who do not intentionally direct their adoration to any Crea|ture
in that Sacrament, and only to the Person of Christ our Lord: and as
when Abimelh mistook Sara from her Husband, being informed by
Abraham that She was his Sister, God was pleased to acknowledge, That
he did it in the simplicity of his heart, so I shall leave such to their Master,
and without particular ground charge no particular Person of them with
the guilt of Formal Idolatry: and should much rather choose to absolve
a Church from approving Idolatry than to render the Persons in it liable
as Idolaters, to be in a Christian State dealt with according to the rigor
(or as some Calvinsts call it) the Equity of the Iewish Law.
As we justly remember the Bigottish Cruelty of the Marian days, so
we must be so just to our selves as not to forget how some Nominal Prote|stants
(and such too as were magni nominis) did long ago (and as they
do still) accue the Discipline of the Church of England, and its decent
Ceremonies with the guilt of Idolatry: and how fatal both to our Church
and State so false and base and spightful an Accusation hath proved.
Mr. Hobs in his History of our late Civil Wars attributes somewhat of the
success of the disloyal Enemies of our Church to the natural Cause of
their fighting with spight.
We know that not only Mr. H. Iacob in his Exposition of the 2d Com|mandment,
printed in the Year 1610. hath thus charged our Church with
Idolatry in express words, but that Ames himself did so in effect in his
Puritanismus Anglicanus that Year printed: and as Learned and Pious a
Man as he was, his Cases of Conscience shewing him tainted with the Tenet
of Monk Gratian and Calvin and our Assembly-men about the Iudicial
Law (for he saith there, That that Law tho not appertaining to Christi|stians,
Sub ratione legis sperialiter obligantis, yet is so sub ratione doctrinae,
quatenus vel generali su natur vel proportionis aequitte exhibet sempe no|bis
optimam juris noturalis determinationem) one might easily gues from
such a Principle when believed and practised, what quarter the Church
of England, or any Church accused of Idolatry could expect.
The truth is, that on the Division of the World by some into 30 parts
and rendring 19 thereof to be down-right Idolaters, and 6 Mahumetans
and 5 Christians, it may well seem a deplorable absurdity that the Chri|stian
Quota should be so much addicted both to call one another Idolaters,
and to Sacrifice one another as such, beyond the superstitious rage of the
Heathen .
Mr. Iacob in his said Exposition calls the Lutherans Idolaters for having
Images in their Churches: and what may well seem strange is, that when
Cromwel the Vsurper being inclined to tolerate the Iews, and appointing a
Meeting of his Ministers of State and his Divines, to debate the lawfulness
of it, at that time Fiennes his Lord-Keeper declared it then unlawful, for
that the Iews were Idolaters, as worshipping God out of Christ, and whereby
he implied in effect that Adam was an Idolater. Thus apt have Enthusi|asts
been to play with Idolatry: but a shameful thing it is to our English
understandings, not to have a just general apprehension of the aim of
some factious Anti-Papists to set up new real Idolatry in the State, while

they are vexing us with their old Nominal Idolatry in the Church; I
here refer to all that would outrage the Hereditary Monarchy, and I
call any Crime of that Nature by the name of Idolatry, as our judicious
Sanderson hath done in his Learned Lecture, De legum humanarum caus
efficiente . 15. where having shewn how Kings are called Gods, Psalm 82. 6.
Quod ipsius Dei in terris vices gerant, idque Deo ipsis Conferente hanc pote|statem,
non populi suffragiis, EGO dixi Dii estis, he thus goes on to
ask very properly, Poteritne populus aliquis sine turpis idololatriae crimine
sibi Deos constituere, cum sit uniuscujusque hominis, ei qui ipsius vicem gerat,
potestatem vicariam su authoritate demandare, non alieno arbitratu? Au|debitne
quisquam mortalium id Iuris sibi arrgare ut qui Dei in terris Mini|ster
 Vice-Deus futurus sit, omnem illam suam authoritatem  potestatem
ab ipso sibi collatam agnoscat?
Let all such then who did AVDERE thus in the Affair of our Here|ditary
Monarchy, and to have the Vice-Deus futurus moulded by their
fancies, consider how great a Casuist hath loaded them with Idolatry:
and moreover remember how the inspired Prophet did make Rebellion as
the Sin of Witchcraft, and contumacy or stubborness as Idolatry.
I was contented with finding one thing asked by the ingenious Au|thor
of the Compendium, because I supposed, and that then even by Calcu|lation,
I might resolve the doubt (and which I have held my self obliged
to do) viz. Can it be said that the Monarchy of England hath gotten by
the Reformation (and what desperate Enemies that hath created us may be
easily imagined) that nothing but Popery, or at least its Principles can
make it again emerge or lasting? but was sorry and ashamed to find that
Authors had cause to cite the disloyal Pamphlet of Pereat Papa, as asserting
the lawfulness of proceeding against Idolaters as is there mentioned, and
that he likewise had so much reason to make so great a Remark on the
Exclusion in the foregoing Page: viz. He who believes he can disinherit
a lawful Successor on the account of Religion, will hardly find Arguments
of force to keep the Prince in being on his Throne whenever this happens to
be imputed to him.
Moreover I was ashamed after the effort of the Idolatry in the Ex|clusion,
and of the Mobile's worshipping a Plot-Witness with the name of
, that the Non-Conformist Author of the Book called The peaceable
Design, printed in the year 1675. speaking so tenderly of the Papists
then in the words of, The Papist in our account is but one sort of Recusants,
and the conscientious and peaceable among them must be held in the same
predicament with those among our selves that likewise refuse to come to Com|mon-Prayer,
yet reprinting his Book in the year 1680. doth thus alter
the former passage, and say, The Papist is one whose worship to us is Ido|latry,
and we cannot therefore allow them the liberty of publick assembling
themselves as others of the Separation.
When the Non-Conformists had a while after the Declaration of In|dulgence
idolized both it and the Papists for being supposed to have had
some hand in the procuring it, and were as soon weary of it as Children
of their Images, yet it seems that presently after the noise of the Popish
Plot, the Non-Conformists Censure of Transubstantiation was transubstan|tiated,
and their Religion grew to be Idolatry: as if the ill actings or
shams of either a few or many indigent or dissolute Persons ought to be
turned on the whole Body of Papists, or especially on their Religion it
self and their Religionary Tenets. But many of the Non-Conformists
then being abandoned to sham the very Church of England and its Disci|pline

with Idolatry, and with a participating in the PLOT to bring in
POPERY, according to what Arch-Bishop Land's Star-Chamber Speech
mentions as the Style of the Libels in those days, That there were then
great Plots in hand, and dangerous Plots to change the Religion established,
and to bring in Romish Superstition, the sagacious Loyal began to see
that they made but a Stalking-horse of the Plot of the Church of Rome to
shoot at the Hereditary Monarchy, and by outcries against the Church of
Rome to bring in a Roman Republick, and to make themselves the Idols
of the People in a popular State, while they complained of the Idolatries
of Churches.
But there remains somewhat else to be said as to this point of calling,
or thinking every particular Papist an Idolater, and that is what I shall
further urge out of the great Speech aforesaid of the Arch-Bishop of
Bourges, who knew well enough that Papists had in their Writings fre|quently
called Hereticks Idolaters (and as accordingly the Author of a
Popish Pamphlet printed in London in the Year 1663, Entituled Miracles
not ceased, hath done, and where his words are, The Protestant Religion is a
Cheat and Heathenism, the Protestant Bishops are Cheaters and Priests of
Baal, the Protestant Religion is ridiculous and idolatrous) yet this Arch-Bishop
in that Speech having (as I said) cleared his Prince tho a Prote|stant
from the guilt of Heresy and Pertinacy, doth likewise there parti|cularly
say, he is no Idolater, and where he likewise hath with great judg|ment
and loyalty taught us, that as to those Constitutions in the Civil
Law whereby Manichees and Arrians are excluded from Magistracy and
publick Office, It was to be understood to be only in the Case of Inferiour
Magistrates and not of Sovereign Princes, who cannot be disinherited of their
Rights without the destruction of the whole Government and People: and to
decree any thing of whom did only belong to the Iurisdiction of God Al|mighty.
There is another thing that inclines me to think my self Morally bound
not to call all Papists Idolaters, and to wipe off the stain of Idolatry from
the Church of Rome as much as any of the Fathers of our Church have
done, and that is the Conversion of England from Heathenish Idolatry, that
Gregory the Great was God's Great Instrument in many hundred of years
ago.
HAving thus Finished my Casuistical Discussion, I shall be glad if
the Result thereof may by the Blessing of God (whose both the De|ceived
and the Deceiver are, according to the words of Iob 12. 16.) be in
all such Protestants who have been deceived into a belief and practice of
the Irreligionary Tenet of Popery, viz. Of Dominion being founded in
Grace, a more exuberant Compassion to all Loyal Papists who have not
believed and practised that Tenet, and may have erred in Popish Tenets Re|ligionary.
'Tis both visible and palpable that such Excluders and No|minal
Protestants while they accused Papists of being deluded into a
Plot to destroy the King, were themselves deluded into a Practice that
would ipso facto have destroyed the Hereditary Monarchy. 'Tis most
plain that by being so deceived they have given occasion to Papists to re|proach
Protestants by saying to this effect, You see how vain your
attempts are to leave Popery and its Tenets: and as he who would
by running or riding or sailing to any remote places, imagine to
be able to get from being under the Covering of the Heavens, would
give any one occasion to upbraid his vanity, by telling him he could

not do it, for that the further he went from being under one part of the
Heavens, he would but Compass the being nearer to another part thereof;
so while you would get from being under the Predominance of one part of
Popery, you obtain but to be the nearer to another part of it: You have
run from the belief of Purgatory to the Tenet of founding dominion in
Grace; and there being no steady hand among you to hold the balance, that
Tenet practised by you would instead of a Purgatory hereafter, make a pre|sent
Hell upon Earth. You are got from the Council of Trent, and yet the
odiosa materia in the very Council of Lateran, which you charge upon us
as a general one, is approved, believed and practised by you: And you
would Exterminate the King's Heirs and Successors as Heterodox in Re|ligion;
and have in effect obsolved your selves from your Oaths Promissory
in their behalfs. Thus therefore doh the Vniversality of our Catholick
and Heavenly Religion seem to be naturally made like that of the Heavens,
from which there is no escaping. Thou who abhorrest Idols dost thou
commit Sacrilege, and abhor the Sacredness of the Regal Power, and of
thy own Oaths? And thou who abhorrest Superstition in things, wilt thou
idolize words, and imagine there can be Sacredness in letters? Doth not
every one know that even literae significantes Sacras sententias non signifi|cant
eas in quantum sacrae sunt, sed in quantum sunt res; erg literae
non sunt Sacrae? Doth not the very word Sacred likewise signifie accurs|ed?
Can therefore the name of true Protestant Legitimate a Calumnious
interpretation of Oaths, more than the name of the Society of Jesus Legiti|mate
the Doctrine of Calumny, or more than the world Catholick Monopolized
formerly by the Donatists and Arrians, could justifie or Sanctifie their
Tenets? Will your name of Reformation weigh any thing, if while you are
come out from among the Religionary Tenets of our Church, you remain
in the Babel of the Irreligionary ones, approvd by some of our Popes and
Doctors and Schoolmen; and which we grant, that if believed and practised
would bring every Kingdom to confusion, and not only into a diversity of
Languages, but into an alteration of the Hereditary Government, and
Transubstantiate even that? If you are angry with us for mistaking Saint
Peter's Successors (as you think) will you not be angry with your selves
for mistaking the Successors of your Kings, so easily to be known? Since you
may think him a wise Child who knoweth his true Spiritual Father, as
well as his true Natural one; will you reproach our understandings for not
knowing that true Spiritual one, and what is the true Church, when you
seem thus not to know your true Political Father, or who is to be in the
course of the descent the true King? Will not you pity us for our Implicit
Faith in the Guides of the Church, in things wherein we cannot hurt you,
when your selves do by Implicit Faith follow the Demagogues in the State
in matters that would destroy us all? When Brutus after he had given the
blow to Caesar, found cause to exclaim of Vertues being an empty Name;
will not you after you have thrown off the Papal Power of Excluding Kings
make your Reformation an empty Name, if you at last reform your selves
into Popery, and after all your imagined Conversions from Popery, we shall
see your natural Conversion to it, and as Natural as the Common Hiero|glyphick
of the year shews us, and how in se convertitur annus?
The truth is, that as to the Case of many of our Nominal Protestants,
and some real ones, being thus deceived as aforesaid in the busi|ness
of the Exclsion, there lyes a Pudet haec opprobri nobis, c.
and a worse opprobrium than that of another common Latine saying,
Stulti dum vitant vitia, c. for here they have run but from Popery

to Popery, from a Popery more genteely clad to a second-had Popery,
and even into a frippery of Antimonarchial notions; and they have run
into the Substance of the worst part of Popery, and what I account
worse then Transubstantiation, while they have been pursuing the magni
nominis umbria, I mean the shadow of the Great Name of Protestant.
And I will still call it a great and noble name, however abused by Schis|maticks,
and tho not used in our Canons and Articles, c. and where|in
we soar above the dictates of Luther and Calvin, and the distincti|ons
of Names they occasioned; and for which purpose our great-Souled
Bramhall in the title page of his Iust Vindication of the Church of Eng|land,
hath the quotation of My Name is Christian, my Sirname is Catho|lic,
by the one I am known from Infidels, by the other from Hereticks and
Schismaticks; but yet doth often in that Book and his other writings use
the word Protestants, for such who have laudably opposed the Papal U|surpations
and Impositions. And in the mentioning of the Protestant
Churches beyond Sea, that word is justly and properly applicable. More|over
our Great Chillingworh's writing of, The Religion of Protestants a safe
way to Salvation, hath endear'd that Name as well as his own to us there|by.
The adherents likewise of the Church of England are often put to
it to use the distinction of Protestant Recusants, to speak Intelligibly.
But 'tis the Church of England-Protestant that the Orthodox and Loyal
generally mean by that name, when they speak of Protestants alone here,
according to the Rule of analogum per se positum, c. It is for the honour
of these Protestants who have not so learn'd Christ and Christianity as to
be untaught their unnatural Allegiance and natural obligation of their
Oaths, that it may be observed of them, that tho many within the pale
of that Church, have been tempted a while to extravagant thoughts and
actings in the point of Exclusion, yet they have through the Divine influ|ences
on their understandings soon come to themselves again; and tho
the Loyalty of some of these like Steel hath been bent, yet it hath not
like lead stood and continued bent: And notwithstanding that being
Transported a while with the Passion of Anger against Papists and Plots,
they said in their haste, that Dominion was founded in Grace, I observ'd
so many of them by their second thoughts so averse from the second-hand
Popery (as I call'd it) that they might merit an exemption from being
censured by Papists as aforesaid; and that by virtue of the Rule of Law,
viz. Quidquid calore iracundiae vel fit vel dicitur, non prius ratum est
quam si perseveranti apparuit judicium animi fuisse; ideoque brevi re|versa
uxor, nec divertisse videtur.
And here I am likewise to observe that tho many who have been
members of the Church of England, because it was by Law Established,
and have for fashion-sake gone to our Common-Prayer with no more
concernment than the Monk went to Mass who said Eamus ad commu|nem
errorem, yet such of this Church whose Devotion hath been deep
rooted in their heads and hearts, and who have seriously thought of those
words in the Collect, viz. So rule the Heart of THY Chosen Servant
Charles our King and Governor, c. did not long say Amen, to any mens
thoughts or motions of Choosing their King.
Let Rome and the Conventicles thus like lead stand bent (as I said) but
the Doctrine of the Church of England and its Prayers have sufficiently
told us whose chosen Servant our King is. I have here occasion to refer
to an Illustrious Son of this Church, and whose whole life hath been as
perfect a Comment on the Oath and Moral Offices of Allegiance and of

absolute and unconditional Loyalty as any could be, and more useful to
the World than any Written one, I mean the Duke of Ormond, and there|fore
it is but Iustice to him and the Subject I have been treating of for
me here to cite him in what was published by the Loyal and Learned
Father Walsh, in Answer to what was by the Nuntio's Party pre|tended
as a Scandal, namely, That one of a different Religion from those
Irish Papists should be MADE CHOICE OF to Govern them: and that
that Party did fear the Scourges of War and Plague to have justly fal so
heavy on them, and some Evidence of God's Anger against them for putting
God's Cause and the Churches under such a hand, whereas the trust might
have been managed in a Catholick hand under the Kings Authority, but to
which the Answer was thus with great Loyalty and Judgment, viz.
Now at length they are come plainly to shew the true ground of their Ex|ception
to us, which they have endeavoured all the whole to disguise under
the Personal Scandals they have endeavoured to cast upon us. They are afraid
of Scandal at Rome for MAKING CHOICE as they call it (as if they
might CHOOSE their Governor) of one of a different Religion. If this
be allowed them, why they might not next pretend to the same fear of
Scandal for having a King of a different Religion, and so the Power
of CHOOSING one of their own Religion, we know not: and concludes with
an Observation of that Party's having infamously practised the Do|ctrine
of Calumny in relation to the then Queen.
And all Papists therefore owning the Disloyal Principles of that Party
have thereby the Pudet haec opprobria, c. put on them. Nor can it be
by any Impartial Relaters of News either told at Gath or published in
Ascalon, that any Sons of the Church of England were actually 
in thinking they might choose their future King, but it must likewise
there be said, how the Fathers and Divines of that Church did in that
Conjuncture so universally, and with such an Impetus of Reason and
Scripture propagate the Doctrine of Passive Obedience, and of the Loy|alty
that the 13th of the Romans, and our Oaths require, whereby the
Popery of founding Dominion in Grace hath been so much Exterminated
from that Church and the Realm, that the very sense and reason and humor
of the People of England is bent against it, and is likely to be so more and
more.
And it was natural for our Divines in this Conjuncture thus to do,
when so many factious counterfeit Protestants were by their outcries
making Papists of them, and publishing infamous Pamphlets that express|ly
shook the Rights of the Hereditary Monarchy, and of the Church by
Law Established, and with an intent to shake the same in that time when
the Exclusion was designed; and as appeared particularly by the reprint|ing
for that purpose the Pamphlet of the Rights of the Kingdom, and in
which the Author did endeavour to prove the Peoples Right to choose their
Bishops. The Clergy therefore seeing such Nominal Protestants by that
real part of Popery of founding Dominion in Grace, thus bent on the ruine
of Church and State, were concerned to bend all their forces of reason
in permonishing People of their danger from that part of Popery.
Thus as when a Light-house is set up to warn Navigators of a Bank of
Sand, if yet by the force of the Sea and Wind such Bank happens to be
removed, the Light-house must be removed likewise, the same thing was
accordingly done by the Justice and Prudence of our Divines giving us
a notification of the Sands of Popery having shifted their place.

The late Experience that our Church had of its usage under the Great
Vsurper, and of his putting it out of his Protection as knowing the born and
sworn Allegiance of its Church-men, and likewise its Doctrine must necessa|rily
make them true Adherents to the King's Heirs and Successors, hath ne|cessarily
taught them that they cannot externally flourish under any Vsur|per
whatsoever. They know that the Oath that Cromwel's Parliament En|acted
to be taken by him was a Canting Oath, and to which he was
sworn to the uttermost of his Power to uphold, and maintain the true reform|ed
Protestant Christian Religion in the Purity thereof, as it is contained in
the Holy Scriptures of the old and new Testament to the uttermost of his Power
and his understanding. The Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of Eng|land
was not to expect to be upheld and maintained by him, nor can it be
upheld or maintained by any Vsurper.
Dr. Gibbon the Author of the Theological SCHEME averred to me,
that Mr. Nye and he attending a Committee of Parliament in the times
of the Vsurpation, that Mr. Nye being desired by the Committee to
give them a definition or description of a Minister of the Gospel, then answer|ed,
A Minister of the Gospel is one sent forth by the State to preach the Gos|pel,
receiving protection from them and maintenance under them, and all
others restrained; and we know that he and others then treated the
Church of England in words and things like an Ecclesia maligrantium; and
how they were then RESTRAINED ab Officio, c. and just as the Faction
and Schism of many Nominal Protestants began about 41 to call our Di|vines
Names, as I have observed, so lately the Popish Plot was made the
Vehicle of the Poyson of some Mens Calumny, and neither Machiavel nor
Iesuit did ever more sledfastly practise the Divide  Impera, than such
men in that Conjuncture did, that by weakening us with our Divisions
they might at once destroy the Lineal Succession of our Hereditary Mo|narchs
in the Realm, and the Succession of Bishops in the Church: and
our Kings in their Coronation Oaths swearing to keep Peace and Agree|ment
to the Holy Church, the Clergy and People, Factious and Schismatical
Persons having broke their own Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy may
be said to have endeavoured to break the King's Oath, according to the
old known form of the Indictment of some of our Iudges for Bribery
in which it was said, that our Kings being bound by their Oath to do Iu|stice
to their People, such Judges did Violare Sacramentum Domini Re|gis.
It hath pleased God by the fierce Zeal of several Non-Conformists for
the Exclusion, to open the Eyes of many Conscientious and Loyal Peo|ple
among them, and to bring them thereby to the Bosom of the Holy
Church of England; for they seeing such Doubts and Objections as some
had raised against the Obligations of our Oaths, to be but Scruples, and
that considerate, serious, and devout Persons of the Church of England
had soon thrown the Scruples away, were naturally thereby induced to
throw off other Scruples; and it was likewise but natural to them to think
that their very Doubts and Objections for their having separated from the
Church of England were but Scruples. And as to doubts, tho the Rule is,
Quod dubitas ne feceris, yet not only Sanderson but Ames hath told us,
that Scruples are not to be regarded: for Ames in his Cases of Conscience
l. 1. c. 16. viz. Of a scrupulous Conscience, having said, That a Scruple is
a fear of the Mind about what one is to do which vexeth the Conscience, as a
little Stone in ones shooe troubles the foot, he wisely concludes, That Multi
scrupuli cum non possint commod tolli contrari ratione, deponi debent quasi

violenti quadam, dum excluduntur ab omni consultatione: and that, Scrupu|lus
est formido temeraria,  sine fundamento, at adeo non potest obligare.
He there mentions, A man being said to be scrupulous in discussing his past
Actions, or in ordering his futue ones: and I am confident that many of
the Loyal late Non-Conformists when they consider their past Actings
will now accord to say, that many of the clamorous pretences they were
tempted to urge for Liberty of Conscience, ought to have been (as Ames's
words are) laid aside with violence: and I do likewise believe that many
of the Pious Members of the Church of England who while the Formido
temeraria and sine fundamento carried them to incline to think it lawful to
shake the Foundation of the Hereditary Monarchy, and the super-stru|ctures
of their Oaths by new interpretations, do with a pious horror
think of the poor Vapours pent in their Imaginations that made such
Temporary Earthquakes in their Moral Offices of Loyalty, and might
have made perpetual ones in the Kingdom.
And that because some of our English Princes long ago, whose Titles
were cloudy, did de facto make use of the Legislative Power to render
them clear to the People, for any to think that therefore the Monarchy
was not then de jure and jure Cronae Hereditary, and that therefore af|ter
the Liquid Oath of Allegiance made to statuminate the most clear Ti|tle
of a Crown that can be supposed, it could since be lawful for any
Parliamentary Power to disturb the Succession and dispense with our
Oaths, can appear to the Considerate to be nothing but a Scruple un|worthy
their thoughts. And moreover because some of our Princes
heretofore desired their Parliaments to intermeddle in setling the Suc|cession,
for any therefore after the Oaths to think it might be lawful to
disturb their Prince with renewed importunities again and again to al|ter
the Course of the Descent after his various Declarations of his Mind
that he would never consent to any such thing, must necessarily ap|pear
to the considerate, a Scruple fit to be thrown off. Much more
then must it appear to such to have been a vile Scruple to have fancied it
lawful to pronounce men Enemies to the Kingdom, because they so loyally
defended the Hereditary Monarchy according to their Oaths in that
HOT Conjuncture, wherein the Air of mens fancies was so generally
infected.
And as in any long Intervals of extreme hot or cold weather not to
participate with the generality of mens bodies in some sensible effects
of it, would argue somewhat of distemper in ones Constitution, so
in the late heat of the Populace against Popery, it was inconsistent with
the soundness of Loyalty not some way to partake of the effects of that
heat, and as I have sometimes perhaps too much with many other Loyal
Persons done. I remember to have read it somewhere in a Print full of
Wit and Loyalty said with gayety of humour to this purpose, viz. That
while a whole Nation was drunk (meaning I suppose intoxicated with the
belief of Witnesses telling incredible things, and the Populace being there|upon
drunk with Anger and Rage against the Persons of the Papists)
it was to little purpose for any one man to be sober. The Notions that men,
had of a Plot were very various. Some then were so far gone in Credulity
as, like the Fool that Solomon saith, believeth every word, they were resolved
to believe every thing the Witnesses had said or would say. The Loyal
generally acquiesced in the Notification of it as published by the Govern|ment,
and thereby discharged part of the Moral Obligations of the Oaths I
have discoursed of, whereby they were to defend all the RIGHTS and

Privileges belonging to the King, his Heirs, c. and one of those Rights
and Privileges is what is allowed by the Law of Nations to all Sovereign
Princes, namely, To have faith given to their publick attestation of any
Fact. Yet Religion allowing men the use of the judicium discretionis about
the sense and importance of the Writ divinely inspired, they modestly
employed their Discretion in considering what by the Dii nominales was
published, and if any thing therein seemed above their reason and not con|trary
to it, their faith rested therein. But the Loyal soon found that
the fears and jealousies of Popery began more and more to turn into fears
and jealousies relating to the Witnesses Veracity, and they could not with|out
a profound horror and astonishment reflect on the intoxication of a
gaeat Body of Men, believing some incarnate Devils in accusing one
that had appeared to Christendom, as great a Saint of her Sex as the stea|dy
practice of all Moral Vertues glorifying a heavenly mind on Earth
could render her, and who with such a Character must shine as a Star in
the History of the Age.
That many of the Popish Clergy about that time vainly endeavoured
to have their Religion Paramount, and had hopes to get their Lands
again, none will think impossible who have since seen some of our Schis|matical
Pastors so infatuated as to think it practicable for them again to
thrive by their old Religion-Trade. And that such particular Persons
as were by the late Earl of Clarendon in his Book against Cressy printed in
the Year 1673. remarked for the petulant and unruly Spirit that swyed
too much among them, might continue in the year 1673. no wise
man doubted: for the said Earl there said, The wisest and soberest
Catholicks of England did all they could to restrain that petulant and
unruly Spirit.
Many sagacious Protestants who knew the irreligious Principles that
the Iesuits Writings swarmed with, were apt to fear that there were then
endeavours to have some of them practised by some ill men who were
Bigots, or Paupers, and whom necessity might prompt to be mercnary
in making disorders in the State. The Iudicious and Learned Bishop
Morly was observed then to have some Notion or Idea of a Popish Plot,
peculiar to himself. And as then many had their various Conceptions
of the noised Plot, so many loyal and serious thinking Persons supposing
it to be very unreasonable and barbarous to involve the whole Body of a
Religion in the guilt of some particular Persons, and on any pretence to
bereave them of that freedom in the profession of their Religion, that
both the Law of the Land and of God allowed them, did employ their
thoughts and fancies for the reclaiming the Age from the humour of se|verity
then shewed to the Persons of Papists in general.
The Earl of Anglesy one of his Majesties Great Ministers publickly mo|ved
him in the hot Conjuncture to release all Papists and even Priests out
of Prison, who were not charged with any thing of a Plot. And the Disloy|alty
of many Nominal Protestants then appearing in their many pub|lished
Prints, it seemed very horrid to all ingenious men that the lives
and liberties of Loyal innocent Papists should be sacrificed to feed the
humours or appetites of any Beasts of Prey in the Ark of the Protestant
Church; I speak with Allusion to those thousands of harmless Sheep
in Noahs Ark employed in feeding about 20 pair of Carnivorous Beasts
there.

I thank God, that while I was a sharer With many of the Loyal,
in the hatred of the Irreligionary Principles formerly maintained by the
Court of Rome, and many of its Churchmen, and particularly of those of the
Iesuits (which that Court hath lately disclaimed,) I have likewise sha|red
with them in the Disclaiming of hatred or enmity to any mens Per|sons,
whether Iesuits, or Iesuited Protestants; and I desire to live no
longer than I shall with the most perfect hatred abhor the Popery of
founding Dominion in Grace, and endeavour to perswade all pretended Pro|testants,
(but real half-Papists) so to hate the same, but likewise with a
perfect Love to love the Persons of their Brethren-Papists. And it is
with Justice to be by all men to our Popish fellow-Subjects acknowledg|ed,
that whatever petulance some of them were formerly guilty of, or of
any ambitious design of making too great a Figure in the internal
Government of the Nation, yet that the deportment of the generality of
them hath of late appeared with such a face, not only of Loyalty but
Modesty, and Complaisance with his Majesties measures in employing
the hands and heads of Protestants of the Church of England in the Ma|nagement
of the great matters of State, as is necessarily attractive of our
Christian Love and Compassion; and the rather for that we have seen at
the same time many Factious Anti-Papists to have made a greater Figure
in the internal Government of the Kingdom, than ever any Papists did
in the Reigns of King Iames and the Royal Martyr, and to have thereby
given disturbance both to the External Government and the Hereditary
Monarchy. I did observe for some Considerable time after the Plot-epo|che
somewhat of a becoming Humanity and Gentleness in many Anti-Papists
relating to the Persons of the Papists, and likewise of the Di|vines
of our Church, but was afterwards sufficiently sensible of their in|tolerable
rancour and animosities against both, and of the infamous use
and application they made of the Iesuits Doctrine of Calumny, and of the
Weapons they borrowed from Parson's of the Succession, to promote the
detestable Exclusion, and of their borrowing from Athens and old
Rome, the Thunderbolts of their old REPVBLICAN Curses, viz.
of ENEMY, c. and throwing them at the most Loyal of our Patri|ots,
and absurdly calling them Enemies to the King and Kingdom, be|cause
they asseted the Rights of the Hereditary Monarchy in opposing
the Exclusion. By that kind of Republican Curses they gave us the omen
of what they would have been at. And so extravagant was the use of
that anathema in the late Conjuncture, that when one in a great Assembly
moved against Sir G. I. (a Person that all the Loyal must own for his
steadiness to the Hereditary Monarchy, and for his having first kindled
that great Zeal for Loyalty which doth now like a wall of Fire defend
our Metropolis, that he might be voted such an Enemy as aforesaid, a
Burgess for that City (as I was info m'd) did Ridiculously and Presum|tuously
move that he might be voted an Enemy to Mankind. But it was
easie for such as had took Gods name in vain, so to take Mankinds.
I shall not degenerate from the Moral Offices of Charity to mens Per|sons,
if I call the Exlusion that would have broke the Balance of the
Monarchy that was the old Balance of the World, enmity to Mankind;
but shall without my here calling any men names leave it to the soft
voice of God's Herald called Conscience to suggest it that tho a man who
was deluded a while by the error of the Exclusion that would have been
so fatal to the Realm, might by reason of any good intentions so for a
while ill guided, not deserve perhaps to be judged to be an enemy to

the King and Kingdom formaliter, yet that if after Consideration and all
thoughts made about his Sworn Allegiance, he doth not make a stand, but
shall at any time again endeavour the going over the Rubicon of the
Bloud Royal in its Line of Succession stated by God and Nature, and the
defending his false-steps beyond it, by Association or Arms: I say I shall
leave it to Conscience to tell him or warn him by the indeleble Characters
of natural right there so legibly Engraved, how much he will deserve
the censure of such an enemy as hath been mentioned; and shall be glad he
may be thereby to better effect warn'd then Caesar was from his Vsurpati|o
by the great Senatus Consultum, which Rivallius in his History of the
Civil Law, Printed in the year 1530. saith that he saw remaining En|graved
on a Marble Pillar by the River Rubicon, viz. Iussu mandatve
P. R. Commilito, armate quisquis es, Manipularisve, Centuriove, turmaeve
legionarie hic sistito, vexillumve sinito, nec citra hunc amnem Rubiconem
signa, ductum, commeatumve traducito. Si quis hujusce jussionis ergo ader|sus
praecepta ierit fueritve, adjudicatus esto P. R. H. ac si contra patri|am
arma tulerit, penatesque  sacris penetralibus asportaverit. S. P. Q. R.
Sanctio Plebisciti. S. ve C. He likewise saith that In Portu Arimini al|terum
est adhuc ejusdem sententiae senatusconsultum, and which appear|ing
to be a Noble piece of Curiosity, and expressive of the same sense wih
the former, tho with some difference of words, I shall here entertain
the Reader with, viz.
Imp. Mil. Tiro. armate quisquis es, hic sistito, vexillumve sinito, arma
deponito, nec citra hunc amnem Rubiconem, signa, arma, exercitumve tra|ducito.
Si quis ergo adversus praecepta ierit, feceritve, adjudicatus esto
Hostis P. R. ac si contra patriam arma tulerit, sacrosve penates  pene|tralibus
asportaverit. Sanctio plebisciti, senatusconsulti, ultra hos fines
arma proferre liceat nemini.
Rivallius having cited these Senatusconsulta, saith that Quibus sena|tusconsultis
Caesar fortassis territus cum  Galli rediens ad Rubiconem
usque pervenisset  adversus Pompeium populumque Romanum bellum
gesturus esset militibus dixisse fertur, et etiam nunc regredi pos|simus,
quod si Ponticulum transierimus, omnia armis agenda erunt.
And thus let all members of the true Church Militant in these
Realms by what name or title soever known, who have been tempted to
think the Exclusion lawful, thank Heaven that they have lived to re|pent
of the same, and that even now they may go back from the sinfullness
of such thought, and consider that if they had passed over this Rubicon,
they were to expect beside the fate of their Involving their Country in
War, the other tremendous one of being found fighters against God, to
whom they were sworn.
I have little further to add but to acquaint the Judicious READER,
that I desire if he findeth any thing here-said, that he may reasonably
think to be not according to the Theological measures of the Church
of England, or the Political ones of the State, or against the
moral Offices of Charity toward the Persons of  men, or
against the Internal Communion due from all Christians to all Christi|ans,
(tho I know of no such thing here said) it may by him be
taken as non dictum. There is no keeping of Passion in number, weight and
measure, and particularly of that of Anger. The Excellent Bishop of
Downe that was, Doctor Ieremy Taylor, hath often told me, That when he
was to return an answer to a Friends Letter that had Anger in it, he never
concern'd himself to return an answer to the angry part of it, because he

considered that the anger of his Friend was over before the Letters ar|rival.
But against all the Irreligionary Principles of the Iesuits, and
particularly that of the Founding Dominion in Grace, I would crave aid
from Posterity for the continuance of my Indignation in the known
words of, O me prop lassum, juvate Posteri, but that the Pope hath saved
me the labour; and so I hope those Principles in them are retiring to
ther Eternal rest, and I desire not to hinder their . And that
no pious Roman Catholick may labour under the weight of being Censu|red
as one who is necessarily to believe and practice some Principles be|forementioned
out of the LATERAN Council: I have mentioned
various things that may be of use to that effect, and perhaps more sa|tisfactory
than what hath by any of their Church been said, who have
denyed it to be a General Council. Such denyal will not effectually do their
work, since Cardinal Perron hath (as I said) shew'd it to be a general one:
and his reputation for his profound Judgment and Learning being so
great and such that the late Learned Lord Faulkland, the Secretary of State,
was wont to say, That Baronius and Bellarmine were but fit to serve him
as amanuenses, or by gathering for him the quotatins out of Authors he had
occasion to consult) it would be in vain for any Learned writer of the
Church of Rome, to think by his Authority to out-weigh that of Perron
the Cardinal. But by my citing likewise that Cardinals not holding
himself obliged to proceed in France according to the measures of that
Council: I have shewed the vanity of mens Fears of any ill effect of it
annoying us here, and as (I hope) I shall be able further to do in my
remarks on the Munster Treaty; and that since all things with God are
possible, we may conclude that tho neither Iesuited Papists or Protestants
should ever recant any of their former Irreligionary Principles, the voice
of Nature may in effect do it for them, and render such Principles ab|solete,
and as insignificant as the Stings of dead Animals.
Several Learned Prints published by Protestant Authors in this Fermen|tation
have urged the Council of Lateran for Princes exterminating He|reticks,
and every one knows that in the barbarous old times of Popery
that Council did operate barbarously to that purpose; and 'tis possible
that in a certain Country in the World I will not name, Hereticks (so cal|led)
have been treated partly after the Mode of that Council by some, with
an intent to encrease our Divisions, and the ferment of the popular hatred
against Papists and Popery here. But the Great Perron having declared
himself not obliged by that Council to shew that severity to the Hereticks
in France, hath sufficiently instructed the World that Roman Catholick
Princes are not by that Council bound always so to do; and the Constel|lation
of the Great Roman-Catholick Kings shining in the Munster Treaty
hath likewise given us light therein.
To Conclude; we are not from the old former Omissions or Commis|sions
of Princes, and People, necessarily to infer future ones. The Pru|dential
Rule is, De futuris semper meliora speranda sunt. It is likewise a
saying often applied by Magerus, De futuro statuere ex praeteritis, pruden|tis
non est.
Seneca having spoke of the continual Changes of things, and how that
Bis in idem flumen non descendimus, c. saith, Ego ipse dum haec loquor mu|tari,
mutatus sum. We have had instances in former times, and in the
late Conjucture, of the Sands of Popery often shifting as I called it. The
Lord-Keeper Puckering in his famous Speech, observed that in one Con|juncture,
the Puritans did then joyn and concur with the Iesuits: and the

Doctrinal Measures of the Iesuits and our Nominal Protestants about the
lawfulness of Exclusion have lately been the same. And I think that such
Protestants may reasonably conclude, That it was not for nothing, and
not without some end that Divine Providence permitted so many of
them to erre therein, and that probably it might be to the end to pro|duce
in their minds so great a degree of Compassion and Charity toward
the Persons of all Roman-Catholick Christians, as may not only last in
this Conjuncture, but be operative in them by all Moral Offices of Huma|nity
and Christianity during their Lives.
