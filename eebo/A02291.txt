 To the honorable, and his very good Ladie, the Ladie Norrice, GEORGE PETTIE wisheth conten|tation in all thinges.
_GOOD Madame, the force of vertue is such, that it purchaseth to those which are indued with it, the good will of those which are strangers vnto them  much more must it make mee duetifully affec|tioned to your Ladiship, who am neither stranger to you, nor vnacquainted with your noble  vertuous disposition: in signe of which my dutie and affection I haue presumed to present vnto you the first sight of this my translation, humbly dedicating it to your honourable protection, knowing that none will more willingly vn|dertake the defence of learning, then those who are indued with sin|guler wit and learning, and thinking none more worthy to receiue the first fruites of learning, then those who beare especiall fauour to learning. I will not heere enter into the wide field of your vertues, for that I knowe you take more pleasure in doing wel, then in hea|ring well, and for that the right Corrall needeth no coulouring, neither the fine Marble painting, neither can my pen possibly pro|cure more honour to your name, then it hath alredie gotten, partly by your owne doinges, partly by the renowmed deedes of the no|ble Gentlemen your sonnes, of whom, some are furnished with suche wisedome, with such discretion, and with such sufficiencie e|uery way, that our Prince and Countrie cannot spare their good seruice: some are indued with suche valour, that our Countrie is too little to conteine the greatnesse of their mindes, some with such manly prowesse, euen in their childishe yeeres, that it stoode our Countrie of late in no small steede, in repressing and subduing our rebellious enimies. And though some of them like Alexander

the great, seeke newe Countries, and newe worldes to shewe their valiancie in, yet they remaine most redy to doe our countrie ser|uice, whensoeuer it shall please our Prince to commaunde their re|turne. And would to God it might please her Maiestie with speede to commaund it: for suche rare iewels are well worth the wearing, such worthy Captaines are necessary to be had in these daungerous times: especially being such whose valiancie is sufficiently knowne to all men, and whose fidelitie may be sufficiently warranted to her Highnesse, by the good and trustie seruice of their noble father my Lorde Norrice, both within this Realme, and out of the Realme,  of their worthie grandfather, my Lorde Williams, both before her Maiestie came to the Crowne, and after: and by the rare vertue which they haue shewed, and the faithfull seruice they haue doone where they are: Whose credite is so great, whose name so renow|med, that it shall neuer die, while the low Countries, while Mack|lin, while Stenewike, no not while the worlde standes. And if a|ny name within these late yeeres, haue by their valiaunt deedes wonne honour to England (without derogation be it spoken) it is the name of the Norrices. And if any parents in Englande may count themselues happie in their children, it is my Lorde Nor|rice, it is your Ladiship. You may compare with Olimpias for her Alexander, with Hecuba for her Hector, with Thetis for her Achilles. And if you bee askt where your iewels are, you may with Cornelia point to your children, you may point to that rare iewell which you haue continually abou you, who both in vertue and bewtie excelleth the richest Diamond, and the most precious Pearle that is. But I am entring into a matter without ende, therefore I will stay at the beginning: humbly requesting you to accept in good part this small proofe of my good will, and to assure your selfe of my redinesse to doe you seruice in greater matters when it shall please you to imploy mee. From my lodging this sixth of February. 1581.
Your Ladiships redily to com|nd, George Pettie.



The Preface to the Readers.
_HAuing (gentle Readers) by reason of a trifling woorke of mine (which, by reason of the lightnesse of it, or at least of the keeper of it, flewe abroade before I knewe of it) already wonne such fame, as he which fyred the Temple of Dianae, I thought it stoode mee vppon, to purchase to my selfe some better fame by some better woorke, and to counteruayle my former Vanitie, with some formal grauitie. And though I knowe all fame to be daungerous, for that if it be good, enuie foloweth it, and if it be yll, shame accom|panyeth it: yet, seeing report once spread, cannot be reuoked, and hyng already past the Pikes in a daungerous conflict without wounde of ho (such was your courtesie) I doubte not now but to escape a fewe stragling shot in a lyght skirmishe, without so much as bearyng the discharge of their Peeces: for the men which wyll assayle me, are in deede rather to be counted friendly foes, then deadly enimies, as those who wyll neyther mislyke with me, nor with the matter which I shall present vnto them, but tendryng, as it were, my credite, thynke it conuenient that such as I am (whose profession should chiefely be armes) should eyther spende the tyme in wryting of Bookes, or publyshe them beyng written. Those which mislyke studie or learnyng in Gentlemen, are some freshe water Souldiers, who thynke that in warre it is the body which only must beare the brunt of all, not knowyng that the body is ruled by the minde, and that in all doubtfull and daungerous matters, it is the minde only which is the man: but hauing shewed els where how necessarie learning i for Souldiers, I ad only, that if we in England shall frame our selues only for warre, yf we be not very well Oyled, we shall hardly keepe our selues from rustyng, vvith such long con|tiance of peace, it hath pleased God to blesse vs. Those vvhich

mislike that a Gentleman should publish the fruites of his learning, are some curious Gentlemen, vvho thynke it most commendable in a Gentleman, to cloake his arte and skill in euery thyng, and to seeme to doo all thynges of his ovvne mother vvitte as it vvere: not con|sidering hovv vve deserue no prayse for that, vvhich God or Nature hath bestovved vpon vs, but only for that, vvhich vve purchace by our owne industry: and if you shall chaunce to enter into reasonyng with them, they wyll at the seconde woorde make protestation that they are no Schollers: whereas notwithstanding they haue spent all theyr tyme in studie. Why Gentlemen is it a shame to shewe to be that, which it is a shame not to be? In diuers thynges, no|thyng so good as Learning. You are desirous to seeme to be that, which you are not, and in Learning, the best thyng of all others, are you afearde to shewe to be that, which you are? Alas you wyll be but vngentle Gentlemen, yf you be no Schollers: you wyll doo your Prince but simple seruice, you vvyll stande your Countrey but in slender steade, you vvyll bryng your selues but to small pre|ferment, yf you be no Schollers. Can you counsayle your Prince wysely, foresee daungers prouidently, gouerne matters of state discreetely, without Learning? no, experience must then be your guide, which wyll be but a blynde one: it must be your Scholemaister. but you shall finde it a dangerous one. To come lower, can you dis|course with Strangers, inquire the state of forraine Countries, geue entertainement to Ambassadours, being no Schollers? no surely, vn|lesse it be with dum shewes and signes: lyke as of late a pleasaunt Gentleman (who could haue spoken sufficiently, yf he had been put to it) being amongst others commaunded to ryde to meete an Am|bassadoure that was commyng to the Court, at his returne a Noble man asked hym merily, what he sayd to the Ambassadoure when he met hym: nothyng (sayd he) but kist my Horses mayne, and came my way. To come lowest of all, Can you so much as tell your Mis|stresse a fine tale, or delight her with pleasant deuice, beyng vnlear|ned? no it must needes eyther be altogether vnsauerie, or els sea|soned with the salte of others: and whether thynke you it more shame that you should shew to haue of your owne, or that she should knowe you filche from others? You knowe Caesar was a braue

Gentleman, but yet he was a Scholler, but yet he wrote Bookes, but yet he came in print. Marcus Aurelius was an Emperour, but he was learned, and set foorth learned woorkes. Therefore (Gentle|men) neuer deny your selues to be Schollers, neuer be ashamed to shewe your learnyng, confesse it, professe it, imbrace it, ho|nor it: for it is it which honoureth you, it is only it which ma|keth you men, it is onely it whiche maketh you Gentlemen: And marke this when you wyll, yf there be any in any place, which seeketh to come vp, or benefite hym selfe by flatterie, by bri|berie, by slauerie, by vallanie, I dare warrant you he is altogether vnlearned: for hauyng no good partes, no good giftes in hym which may preferre hym, he flyeth to those sinister shyftes as his surest stayes: whereby you see that it is Learnyng which accomplisheth a Gentleman, and the want of it which blemisheth hym: and that neither comlinesse of personage, neither gaynesse of garmentes, neither any exteriour Ornamentes are to be compared to the linea|mentes o Learning, without which, though a man shake the feather after the best fashion, and take vpon hym neuer so bygly he shall neuer be accounted of amongst the wyse, nor neuer be filed on the roale of ryght and sufficient Gentlemen. And this I hope wyll sa|tisfie those which mislyke that Gentlemen should publishe the fruites of their studie, especially seeing thereby Learning is aduaunced, and a great number pleasured and profited: and seeing the only way to win immortalitie, is either to doo thinges woorth the writing, or to write thynges woorthy the readyng? And yf they obiecte that that seeking of immortalitie, is a signe of vayne glory: to answere them playnely and humanely, I am flat of this minde, that they which passe not of prayse, wyll neuer doo any thyng woorthy prayse. There are some others yet who wyll set lyght by my labours, be|cause I write in Englysh: and those are some nice Trauaylours, who returne home with such quaesie stomackes, that nothyng wyll downe with them but Frenche, Italian, or Spanishe, and though a woorke be but meanely written in one of those tongues, and finely translated into our Language, yet they wyll not sticke farre to preferre the Originall before the Translation: the cause is partly, for that they cannot so soone espie faultes in a forraigne Tongue

as in their owne, which maketh them thynke that to be curraunt, which is but course, and partly for that strange thynges doo more delyght them, then that which they are dayly vsed to: but they consider not the profite which commeth by readyng thynges in their owne Tongue, whereby they shall be able to conceiue the matter much sooner,  beare it away farre better, then yf they reade it in a strange Tongue, whereby also they shall be inabled to speake, to dis|course, to write, to indite, properly, fitly, finely, and wysely, but the woorst is, they thinke that impossible to be doone in our Tongue: for they count it barren, they count it barbarous, they count it vnworthy to be accounted of: and, which is woorse, as I my selfe haue heard some of them, they report abrode, that our Countrey is barbarous, our maners rude, and our people vnciuile: and when I haue stoode with them in the comparison betweene other Countreys and ours, and poynted with my finger to many grosse abuses, vsed in the places where we haue ben, when by no reason they haue ben able to defende them, they haue shronke in their necke, and tolde me that it was the fashyon of the Countrey: not considering that the maners and fa|shions of eche Countrey, are the only thyng that make it counted barbarous or ciuile, good or bad. But for our Countrey, I am perswa|ded that those which know it, and loue it, wyl report it for the ciuilest Countrey in the worlde: and if it be thought to be otherwyse by strangers, the disorders of those traueylers abrode are the chiefe cause of it. And to speake but of the lyghtest, their enuying one another, their deprauing one another, their flowing one another, their falling out one with another, their fighting one with another in the open streete (as with blushyng I haue often behelde in Paris) their contemning of their Countrey fashions, their apish imi|tation of euery outlandish Asse in their gestures, behauour, and ap|parell, are the only causes that make Strangers count our Countrey and our people barbarous: for at home it is well knowne that vve liue in lawes as orderly, in maners as decently, in apparrell as coly, in diet as delicately, in lodging as curiously, in buildinges as sumptu|ously, in all thinges as aboundantly, and euery vvay as ciuilly, as a|ny Nation vnder Heauen. For the barbarousnesse of our tongue, I must lykewyse say that it is much the worse for them, and

some such curious fllovves as they are  if one  to deriue any vvoord from the Latine, vvhich is insolent to their eares (as perchaunce they vvyll take that phrase to be) they foorthvvith make a iest at it, and terme it an lukehorne terme. And ough for my part I vse those vvords as litle as any et I know no reason vvhy I should not vse them, and I finde it a fault in myselfe that I do not vse them: for it is in deed the rdy vvay to  our tongue, and make it copious, and it is the vvay vvhich all tongues haue taken to inrich them selues: For take the Latine vvoords from the Spanish tongue, and it shall be as barren as most part of their Countrey: take them from the Italian, and you take avvay in a manner the vvhole tongue: take them from the Frenche, and you marre the grace of it: yea take from the Latine it selfe the vvoords deriued from the Greeke, and it shall not be so flovv|ing and flourishing as it is. Wherefore I marueile hovv our english tongue hath cracke it credite, that it may not borrovv of the Latine as vvell as other tongues: and if it haue broken, it is but of late, for it is not vnknovven to all men hovv many vvoordes vve haue fetcht from thence vvithin these fevve yeeres, vvhich if they should be all counted inkepot termes, I knovv not hovv vve should speake any thing vvithout blacking our mouthes vvith inke: for vvhat vvoord can be more plaine then this vvord plaine,  yet vvhat can come more neere to the Latine? What more manifest, then mani|fest? and yet in a manner Latine: What more commune then rare, or lesse rare then commune, and yet both of them comming of the Latine? But you vvyll say, long vse hath made these vvoords cur|raunt: and vvhy may not vse doo as much for these vvoords vvhich vve shall novv deriue? Why should not vve doo as much for the posteritie, as vve haue receiued of the antiquitie? and yet if a thing be of it selfe ill, I see not hovv the oldnesse of it can make it good, and if it be of it selfe good, I see not hovv the nevvnesse of it can make it naught: Wherevpon I infer, that those vvoords vvhich your selues confesse by vse to be made good, are good the first time they are vt|tered, and therfore not to be iested at, nor to be misliked. But hovv hardly soeuer you deale with your tongue, how barbarous soeuer you count it, hovv litle soeuer you esteeme it, I durst my selfe vndertake

(if I were furnished with Learnyng otherwyse) to wryte in it as copiouslye for varietie, as compendiously for breuitie, s choycely for oordes as pithily for sentences as pleasauntly for figu and euery way as eloquently, as any writer should do in any vugar tongue whatsoeuer. Thus hauing (as I hope) satisfied my curious enimies, I am to craue he good wyll of my courteous friendes desiring ou (gentle Reader) to accepte in good part these my labours, which f they shall lke you, I shall counte my gay great yf not, yet must I needes count my lsse but light, in that the doing of it, kept me from idleness a thing so daungerous to young Gentlemen, that I wish you al, aboue al thinges to auoyde it: And so fare you well, from my Lodgeing neere Paules.
Yours to imploy George Pettie.

GEntle Readers, I haue supplyed diuers thinges out of the Italian original, whiche were left out by the French translator, with what iudgment. I referre to your iudgement I haue included the places within two starres as you may see throughout the Booke. I haue not published the fourth Booke, for that it contayneth muche triflyng matter in it. Farewell.








The first booke of Ciuile Conuersation, by Maister Steuen Guazzo. Conteining in generall, the fruites that may be rea|ped by conuersation, and teaching how to know good companie from yll.

PROEME.
_I Went the last yeere to Saluce to doe my duetie to the most famous and excellent Lorde Lewes Gonzaga Duke of Neuers, my olde maister and friende, being very glad that he was come into Italy, Lieue|tenant general of the most Christian king Charles the ix. A degree which no doubt was due vnto him: for were it so, that he had not heretofore wonne it by meanes of his owne valour and seruice doone to the king for the space of xxii. yeeres, and namely, the day wherein fighting valiantly, being but xix. yeeres old, he was taken prisoner at the battell of S. Quintance, yet it might suffice to make him worthie of a charge so great as that, the blood which he hath shed, not eight monethes since at his returne into Fraunce amongest the enimies of the Catho|like faith, and the woundes which yet at this day put vs in some doubt of his life and recouerie. Now to returne to my purpose, I found there the gentleman my brother William, who seemed to me to be altogether changed (and yet I had seene him not past two yeeres before in Fraunce) he was be|come so weake, leane, and falne away, by the harde handling of a very long quartane Ague, and of other great distempe|ratures of his body: which as he bewailed and bewraied vn|to mee, I could not for my life (seeing him in suche piteous case, and hearing him drawe out his wordes so softly and so weakely) keepe the teares out of my eies. For I not only loue him as a younger brother, but honor him as if hee were the eldest: but that my pitie might not make him think worse of himselfe, I foorthwith withstood my selfe, and with a more couragious countenance, I began to put him in hope that

hee might recouer his health, so soone as hee shoulde see his friendes and parents, who did earnestly looke for him, and so soone as he might haue the aduice and counsell of some good Phisition of that Citie there. Whither not long after the Duke being come to see the most excellent Princes Leo|nor of Austria his cosen,  vnderstanding the iust desire hee had to see againe our house, he was content with his depar|ture,  to let him be heere for the space of sixe dayes. Ther|vpon we thinking good to assemble the most excellent Phi|sitions of this Citie, hee feeling himselfe by this time wee|ry of the purgations hee had alredy taken, and besides the Winter approching, thought best to deferre this cure vntill the Spring time, what time hee hoped to be in Italy, with his Maisters leaue: not onely to seeke remedie for his sicknesse, and to preserue himselfe from greater euill, but also to passe the rest of his life in quietnesse. While he was in this deli|beration, in commeth Maister Anniball Magnocaalli our neighbour, aswell in house as in hearte, who besides the name he hath gotten of an excellent Philosopher and Phi|sition, for the diuersitie of Arts wherewith he is indued, is counted in the number of those which are called Generals, and by his good behauiour maketh himselfe so acceptable, that I maruel nothing at all if in so little time which hee re|mained with the Gentleman, he stirred vp in his hart by his delightfull deuise, an extreeme desire to inioy longer time his pleasant companie. Neither was maister Anniball lesse glad to haue founde my brother according to his minde: Wherevpon drawne by a soden and mutuall affection, they gaue occasion eche to other to visite one another so of|ten as conueniently they might. And so great was the cur|tesie of the Phisition, that not suffering my brother to take the paines to visite him, hee came the nexte day, and founde him at the Table, but newe dyned. After that, with|drawing themselues into a little closet, where I vse to haue a fewe small bookes, rather for a shewe then for studie, they there passed a great parte of the day (which they continued the three nexte dayes following) with many notable dis|courses,

which my brother to pleasure tooke recount vnto me in the euening following:  for that I thought them so well seasoned, that they might long time bee preserued to the profite of posteritie, euer since my brothers departure, vntil this present, I haue been gathering together their dis|courses, which in effect were like to these which followe heere.


Guazzo. Anniball.
_I Greatly giue GOD thankes (Maister Annibal) for that ha|uing visited me with a long, and perchaunce a curelesse dis|ease, to cleanse my wretched soule of some wicked humour, he ministreth also meanes vn|to me, sometimes whereby I may passe away my euill with lesse annoy, as this day I doubt not but I shall haue by meanes of your acceptable presence, whereof I receiue more assistance and contentment than I am able to expresse.

Annib.
I haue cause (Maister Guazzo) to thinke well of you, for many causes, but chiefly I fele my selfe forced thereto, for that I se you take your sicknesse of the hands of God (most good and full of power, from whom all thinges procede) and to shewe a Christian modestie in laying the fault on your selfe: that certesse is a thought sutable to the crosse you beare on your breast. But I will not herefore commende you so much, but that I must reprehende you a little (and beare with me if I speake plainely vnto you) for that you call this your disease, in a manner curelesse, and seme to distrust, that he which hath sent

it you cannot likewise rid you of it. Touching the opinion you haue of my presence, I wil neither blame you nor praise you for it: But you may assure your selfe, that in steede of those signes of good will which I cannot shewe outwardly, I beare you an inward affection in my heart, readie prest to doe you seruice. But I pray you make not strange to let me vnderstande your state, not as a Phisition (for that as nowe would stand you in small sted) but as a friend, from whom you ought not to hide your mishaps.


Guaz.
My brother hath alreadie promised me of you, al that may be looked for of a skilfull Phisition, and singuler friende. But for that I am to returne into Italy, at a season more conuenient for the cure of those which are sick, I ment to haue stayed till then to open vnto you my woundes, and amongst the rest, those of the heart, which I fele oppressed with so great melancholie, that in my fancy, I had good rea|son to say, that my euill is perhaps incurable, seing it hath weried to no purpose almost all the Phisitions of Paris and Fraunce.


Annib.
Touching the infirmitie of the body, in ded it is requisite of necessitie to stay till the Winter be past, to heale it, if vrgent necessitie constraine you not to vse more spedie remedie: but to the maladie of y^e mind, you ought at al times to apply apt remedies, indeuouring so much as you may pos|sibly, to be merie,  to tread vnder foote al irksome thoughts which molest you.


Guaz.
I do verily, as you aduise me, willingly imploy all the time my bounden seruice will spare me,  all the lei|sure I can get, in some honest pleasure: but for al that, I can|not forget nor driue away my troublesome thoughts.


Annib.
One that is sicke, ought chiefly to consider the things that helpe him, and the thinges that hurt him, to the ende to eschewe the one, and insue the other. And therefore I should thinke it good, you shoulde call to your remem|brance such thinges as you haue founde by long experience to haue increased or diminished this your anguish of mind, or melancholie, as you please to terme it.



Guaz.
I remember I haue plainly noted, that the com|pany of many is greuous vnto me, and that contrariwise, solitarinesse is a great comfort and ease of my trauels. And though for the seruice of my Prince, I must of force be con|uersant not only with other Gentlemen his seruants, but al|so in the Cour, to discourse and deale with diuers persons of diuers countries  nations, yet I do it against the heart,  I goe to it as the Torteise to the inchauntment: for I fele it a great trauell to my minde, to vnderstand other mens talk, to frame fit answeres thereto, and to obserue suche circum|stances, as the qualitie of the persons, and mine owne honor require: which is nothing els but paine and subiection. But when I withdrawe my selfe into my lodging either to reade or write, or to repose my self: then I recouer my libertie, and let loose the raines thereof, in suche sorte, that hauing not to yeld account of it selfe to any, it is altogether applied to my pleasure and comfort.


Annib.
Doe you thinke to recouer your health in con|tinuing long that solitarie life?


Guaz.
I dare not say so.


Annib.
It is now that I begin to feare least this ma|ladie be perchaunce incurable.


Guaz.
And I nowe begin to know by your words that you are that plaine felow you told me you were. But if those which should put heart into me, discourage me, how shall I be able to comfort my selfe?


Annib.
Goe too Gentleman, take heart at grasse, for your euill is easie to be cured.


Guaz.
You haue in your hands the weapons of Achil|les, with the which you both wou~d  heale: but it must neds be, that of these two contrarie propositions, the one be false.


Annib.
Both the one and the other is true. For all the Phisitions not only of Fraunce, but of all Europe no not Es|culapius himselfe, by any medicine, either simple or co~pound, can without great difficultie, giue you the least helpe in the world, so long as you ceasse not (as I se you doe not) to pro|cede in your doings contrarie to their prescription  minde.

On the other side, I can assure you aswell by that you haue told me, as by certain signes which I begin to discrie in you, that your euill is easie to be cured: for that the medicine is in your owne handes, whereby in short time you may be re|stored to your health. And to speake hereof more plainely, I must nedes tell you, that to exempt your selfe out of this e|uill, you must first giue your selfe to cut of the cause and originall thereof.


Guaz.
Howe shall I cut it of, if I know it not?


Annib.
I will let you know it: your euill commeth of the false imaginatio~ you haue, by meanes wherof, like vnto the flie which flieth about the candle, with pleasure, you pur|chace your death, and in steede of consuming and staruing your euill, you giue it nourishment. For thinking to receiue solace by meanes of a solitarie life, you fill your self full of ill humors, which take roote in you, and there lie in waite rea|die to search out secrete and solitarie places conformable to their nature,  to flie all mirth and company: and as hidden flames by force kept downe are most ardent, so these cor|rupt humours, couertly lurking, with more force consume, and destroy the faire pallace of your minde. And therefore I would wish that, leauing that wrong opinio~, wherby hither|vnto you went about, cleane contrarie, to redresse your euil, you should change your order of proceding,  to account so|litarinesse for poyson, and companie, for an Antidote, and the foundation of life: and to frame your selfe to cast of solita|rinesse as a concubine,  to take companie into your fauour, as a lawfull spouse.


Guaz.
Yet I haue heard many famous Phisitions of this opinion (which experience also sheweth) that to haue health of body, it is necessarie to haue contentment of minde.


Annib.
It is true, now what will you inferre of that?


Guaz.
Mary if that be true, it shal folow likewise, that solitarines is good for the body, bicause it recreates the mind: what say you now?


Annib.
I haue alreadie shewed you, that the pleasure of solitarinesse (considering your compleion) is counterfeite, I now further prooue it to you. For the true pleasure (to speak

humanly) is that which naturally giueth pleasure to al per|sons in generall. And therfore, though solitarinesse be agre|able to melancholike persons, yet it is vnpleasant to all o|ther, which you shall better vnderstand, if you marke howe some women with childe long to eate things which al other folke abhorre: and yet for all that we must not say that such meats are conuenient, for though they please some women, yet commonly they are displeasant to al. And when the me|lancholike person,  the woman with childe shalbe rid, the one of his false imagination,  the other of her altered taste, they will haue in hate the things aboue said.


Guaz.
You make me now doubt least I be in worse case then I am aware of: for you meane by your wordes to include me in the number of the melancholike, which haue their wit so breched, that they cannot discerne swete from sowre. But if I flatter not my selfe, I haue a whole minde within my crasy body, and my pleasure is common to other men of good taste: and though company pleaseth some, yet I knowe many of great valour and depe vnderstanding, which cannot away with company, and loue solitarinesse so wel, as fishes doe the water: so that either I am besides my selfe, or els the definition which you haue assigned to plea|sure is besides the trueth: considering that not only conuer|sation, but diuers other pleasures, are acceptable to some,  irksome to other som. As it falleth out of games, of feasts, of Musicke, and other delightes, from which a great many men flie,  more willingly leane to graue matters, and these are for the most part me~ of good calling,  not of the co~mon sort.

God graunt that I may neuer haue more occasion to doubt that your brain is distempered, then it euer entred into my thought to say it,  if I shold say it, rather I (the~ you) might be thought scarse wel in my wits: your reasons make nothing against the definition which I assigned to pleasure, but rather confirme it. For those which like not of games, musicke, Feasts,  companies, haue either by long studie,  great conte~plation, or by som other accident, got an habite  custome to be melancholik. And though in the world there be found a greater nu~ber of these the~ of y^e other, yet in this they

make no number, for that in these pleasures before said, they haue lost their taste by chaunce, not by nature, wheras those pleasures do delight naturally. By this same reason we are to set downe this other ground, That man, being a compag|nable creature, loueth naturally the conuersation of other men, and doing the contrarie, he doth offend nature her self: for which fault many haue done penance. For som by remai|ning inclosed in these voluntarie prisons; become ill fauou|red, leane, forlorne,  filled full of putrified blood, by meanes whereof, their life and manners come to corruption. Inso|much that some take after the nature of sauage beasts, some waxe couragelesse,  stand in feare of their owne shadowes. I ceasse to rehearse vnto you what hath happened to diuers men, who by liuing long time in solitarinesse, haue falne in|to such vehement and frantike fansies, that they haue giuen occasion to be laughed at, and pitied. Wherfore waying the things which are to be read in writers co~cerning those kind of men, and the things which I my selfe haue sene, I thinke nothing at all strange that which is reported of a poore selie soule, who thinking himselfe to be transfourmed into a grain of Millet, for a long time durst not come foorth of his cham|ber, for feare the poultrie would eate him vp. And as it is not possible without great labour and sleight to take away the false imagination from these kind of Melancholike persons, so there are other sortes of them, that haue made themselues away by the meanes either of water, or fire, or sworde, or by throwing the~selues headlong from on high, or els at the en|ding of their daies, by their naturall death they haue giuen some certaine testimonie of their follie. Like as the melan|cholike Athenian did, who no lesse at his death, then in his life time, refusing the conuersation of men, left these verses vpon his Tombe.

Heere doe I lie, ne am the same
I heeretofore was woont to bee:
Thou Reeder neuer aske my name
A wretched end God send to thee.

I am satisfied in this point,  I yeld vnto you, that

solitarines is an enemy to health: but I would know on the contrarie side, what pleasure I may looke for by Conuersati|on, seing that for one man which I met with to my minde, I light vppon more then a hundred, which either by igno|rance, either by pride, either by follie, either by ambition, either by altercation, or by vnsemely behauiour, doe so vexe and trouble me, that my minde and bodie both receiue great hurt thereby.


Anniball.
I haue no marueile of that, for the number of the insufficient, is farre greater then of the accomplished, yet it is your part, so much as you may, to leaue those, and leane to these: and seing our age doeth so participate with the qualitie of yron, that there are not any to be found of the golden world with whom you may be conuersaunt, it is not amisse to call to minde that cmmon prouerbe amongst cou~|trie men, That wee must not leaue to sowe corne for feare least the byrdes eate it vp: so likewise we must not sticke to come foorth of our doores, to doe our businesse in dealing with men, for feare of ill companie. As if you were bounde from Padua to Venice, you will not let slip oportunitie, for that you will not imbarke your selfe in a vessell wherin there are sometime men, women, religious, seculer, Souldiours, Courtiers, Almans, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Iewes, and other of diuers nations and qualities. And therefore we must force our will, and make it sometime content it selfe with that it liketh not, whereof followeth a vertue of ne|cessitie. Touching this I will tell you, that the place  time haue sometime forced mee to be present (rather with my bo|die then minde) in the companie of those persons, which I could verie ill away withall, as beeing altogether different from my manner of life and profession: from whom neuer|thelesse I could not withdrawe my selfe, least I shoulde be thought to take vpon me, either too muche grauitie, or too li|tle courtesie. And though at the first I was in my dumpes, yet afterwarde I went away well pleased and ioyful: seing that I had so well framed my selfe to the humours of others, and that I had got my selfe honestly away being verie well

thought of by the companie when I was gone: so likewise when you shall be acquainted with the course of the worlde, and when by long vse, you shal be brought to abide the com|panie of suche manner of people, you shal perceiue, that if it be not good for your health, yet at least it shal not be hurtful.


Guaz.
I plainly perceiue the vnderstanding you haue, as well of thinges belonging to the vertue of the minde, as the health of the bodie: And for that I loue of life to heare such discourses, I should bee verie glad (if it might so please you) wee might enter into argument, which is more auaile|able to mans state of solitarines or co~uersation, for I would be loth you should at any time teach me to take a medicine which might procure health to my bodie, and sicknesse to my minde, which I could neuer finde in my heart to doe, but had a great deale rather ende my dayes hardly in some de|sart.


Anniball.
There are certeine kindes of spectacles which make thinges shewe greater then they are: so your courte|ous good will maketh you go beyond the trueth, in the iudge|ment of my knowledge, which commeth nothing nere to that you speake of, and yet it is not so litle, but it knoweth that the Gentleman which warneth and summoneth me to this combat, is verie well appointed of weapons and cou|rage. Yet notwithstanding, without loosing any more time in excusing my ignoraunce, I am readie to heare most wil|lingly wherevpon your opinion is grounded, which semeth to incline to solitarinesse, to the intent to answere you, not learnedly, but according to the abilitie of my weake ca|pacitie.


Guaz.
Thinke not, I besech you, that I enter into the lystes against you, like a subtile Logitian, for I neuer lear|ned the places from whence argumentes are drawen, and that which I say, is rather of mine owne opinion, then by any iudgement or learning: but my desire is to giue you oc|casion to giue me some light of knowledge, being willing rather to vnderstande, then to withstande: for when you

make answere to my demaundes, I take so great pleasure in it, that I may say with the Poet Dant.

Your resolutions, doe me content so well,
That I delight as much to aske, as if my selfe could tel.



Annib.
I attribute all that to your curtesie. Nowe I will tell you touching this matter, that if we will doe our diligent endeuour to searche out the effectes of solitarinesse and Conuersation, howe many sortes there are of them, and howe they are to be vnderstood, we shall soone be agreed, and we shall not nede to imploy much time in reasoning of the matter. Wherevpon I would haue vs differ,  a litle su|spend these seuerall pointes, and first intreate of this mat|ter in generall, that thereby I may haue occasion to enioy longer your delightfull and discrete communication. But I will not forget (as one that tendreth your health) to put you in remembrance, that it is not good for your sickly bodie to occupie your minde ouer earnestly, in considering the matter ouer depely: for oftentimes the desire of gainsay|ing and to haue the vpper hande in reasoning, doth inflame, distemper, and distroy the bodie: And thereof come often|times reumes whih deceiue many Phisitions, and make them iudge that they procede of contrarie causes. Where|fore I aduise you for your health, and mine also, not to be too earnest in this discourse, and so I shall with more ease be able to answere you.


Guaz.
I am not (sir) any of those vainglorious persons, which contende earnestly to the intent to be counted more braue fellowes then other: I will vtter plainly those things which I remember to haue heard heretofore of the learned, and which shall be put into my head by the spirite of reason, referring afterward the whole to your sound  perfect iudge|ment.


Annib.
I am verie glad our discourses are rather fa|miliar and pleasaunt, then affected and graue: and I protest for my parte, many tymes (as occasion shall

serue) to let you heare Prouerbes, which verie Artificers haue in their mouth, and comptes, which are vsed to be old by the fire side, both for that I naturally liue by suche foode, and also to giue you occasion to doe the like, and thereby to haue an eye as well to the health of the bodie, as the minde.


Guaz.
I promise to imitate you so much as I may, and to fall nowe to the skirmishe: I say first, that to climbe to the true seruice of God, and the enioying of those heauenly incomprehensible and eternall benefites which he hath pro|mised to his faithfull, the desartes, al by places and solitarie, are the right ladders. And contrariwise, companies are nought els but hookes and tonges, which withdrawing vs by force out of the course of our good thoughtes, set vs in the way of distruction: for that this life being full of suspitions, deceites, lasciuiousnesse, periuries, detractions, enuy, oppres|sions, violences, and other innumerable mischiefes, a man can not turne his eyes aside, but that he shalbe forced to be|holde some euil thing or other, which entereth and insinua|teth it selfe by a broade way vnto the heart, where after|warde are planted those venimous graftes, which growe to the destruction of the soule. The which neuer happeneth to the solitarie, who being safe from all inticements, intang|linges, and surprises, being altogether out of loue with the worlde, is whollie raised vp to the contemplation of his ori|ginall and happie state. Likewise, whosoeuer will obteine Gods assistance by his prayers, must abandon companies, and withdrawe him selfe to his chamber (for so God expres|ly commaundeth) and therefore it is no meruell if he were so well pleased with the deuout workes wrought especially in the wildernesse by the first fathers, Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Moses, Helias, and Ieremie, neither ought the example of our first father to way any lesser with vs, who was as happie while hee liued in solitarinesse, as he was after miserable and griefefull when he was in companie. I could here rehearse vnto you many persons, who know|ing that the vanities of the worlde,  Conuersation amon|gest

men, were impediments to the seruice of God,  their owne saluation, haue ioyfully left their proud Palaces, their great riches, their high degres, the companie of their fami|lie, friendes, and parents, to cloyster vp them selues in poore Monasteries, there, to ende their life in holinesse and pati|ence. But if the examples alreadie recited be of no force with you, looke vpon the doings of Christ, who being to make his prayers vnto GOD his Father, went vp to the moun|taine: being too fast, kept him selfe solitarie, and got into desertes at the death of Iohn Baptist. Now if we wil con|sider, besides the seruice of God, howe muche the solitarie life auaileth to our instruction and happie life, we can not but curse whether it were Saturne or Mercury, or Orphey, or Amphion, or whosoeuer it were, who gathered  assem|bled together into one bodie, the people scattered abroade in Forrestes and Mountaines, where they followed nature in stead of lawe, not crediting the subtile persuasions of other, but their owne giltlesse conscience, and leading a loyall, simple, and innocent life, had not yet whetted their tongues to slaunder their neighbours, gaue not their mindes to cru|elties, neither had infected and corrupted their manners with the contagion of vices, which began to growe hot in the Cities and assemblies of men. And for that cause you se that naturally all persons indued with knowledge and vertue (to auoyde the common sort which delighteth in com|pany) withdrawe them selues with great pleasure into by-places, and distant from the people, to haue leasure for their goodly and laudable contemplations. And if this be true, as no doubt it is, that the Philosophers excell all other men so farre as light doeth darknesse, it is a plaine case, that to saile surely in the depe sea of diuine Philosophie, we ought to take wary heede to flie, more then Scylla and Chaibdis, the Conuersation of men, as they did: not only getting them|selues out of the prease of people, but setting light by, and refusing the gouernment of common weales, and those chief honours and offices which ambitious men goe all day long with great labour and are canuassing and crauing for. And

though it shall seme perchance vnto you, that Conuersation and companie is naturally desired of all men, yet remember your selfe of the sentence which once you brought against me, which, if you be an indifferent iudge, ought to haue place against your selfe in the same case: which is, that a man must not make reckoning or account of the multitude of people, which either for the desire of some vaine pleasure, or vile gaine, or fickle and transitorie promotions, are alwayes in companie and Conuersation: and heerein we ought to fol|lowe the opinion of the Philosopher, who at his returne from the Bathes, being asked whether there were in them any great number of men, answered, no: and a litle after, as one asked him if there were good store of people, answe|red, yea. Wherefore you must agre with me, that if Con|uersation yelde pleasure or profite, it is for the most part to the ignorant and carelesse, to whom solitarinesse is a kinde of torment: for that being alone they are good for nothing but to count the clocke, which they thinke goeth too slowly. Wherevpon riseth the saying, That leasure without lear|ning, is a death and sepultary of a liue man, which neuer happeneth to the learned, who then only liue, when being se|questred from others (not men if I may lawfully say it) they get themselues into this earthly Paradise of solitarinesse, where they fede their minds with the most pleasant A pleasant li|quour fained to be the drinke of the Gods. Necter of lerning. Neither is it any thing ridiculous, which Dioge|nes merily and mistically did, who going to the church doore, as the people went out, thrust into the midst of them, and at length got into the Church, saying, it was the part of such as he was, to be alwayes co~trarie to the multitude: which was to shewe, that we ought according to the saying of the Poet, To folow the fewer sort, and not the common crue. And that ment Pythagoras when he said, He kept not to passe by the co~mon way. I could alledge vnto you many other things in prayse of the solitarie life, which is by good right  reason singular, for that it is alone the right life acceptable to God, and godly men, a friend to vertue an enemy to vice, the true nstitution and forme of life. So that for my part most com|monly

I remaine solitarie, and say alwaies in my heart (as that holy man saide) The Citie is to me a prison, and solita|rinesse a Paradise. But I will here stay to heare your opini|on of these my reasons.


Annib.
You haue swarued nothing at all in this dis|course from the dutie of a perfect Courtier, whose propertie it is to do all things with carefull diligence, and skilfull art: mary yet so that the art is hidden, and the whole semeth to be doone by chaunce, that he may thereby be had in more ad|miratio~. And so taking that course, you haue here co~mended solitarinesse, partly by reasons deriued from your owne good wit,  partly by y^e doctirine you haue learned of some famous writers,  specially of Petrarch Vida, of whose name  au|thoritie you haue made no mention, because you would hide that glorious doctrine, which some y^t are learned vse to disco|uer, in hauing alwaies in their mouth the name, assoone of some Philosopher, assoone of some Poet, assoone of some Ora|tor. But yet you could not in suche sort couer this cunning, but that I perceiued it,  was thereby occasioned greatly to commend your discrete iudgement. Now for that I am of a contrary opinion to yours, it standeth me vpon to answere from point to point, to the reasons which you haue brought: whereof the first (if I be not deceiued) is grounded vpon the seruice of God  our saluation, wherto in your opinion Con|uersation is an hinderance: which truly I will not sticke to graunt you, if you be able to prooue me that the seruice of God is only perfourmed by the meanes of solitarinesse. But I am sure you will not denie me, that he hath left vs many commaundementes by his owne mouth, for the execution whereof, Conuersation is necessary. For you cannot goe to visite the sicke, to releue the poore, to correct and admonishe your brother, to comfort the afflicted, if you remain alwaies mewed vp. And therefore if you will haue solitarinesse serue to appease the wrath of GOD, and to obtaine fauour at his handes, you shoulde say that it is profitable and necessary onely for the time appointed for prayer. But for all that, I will not graunt you that it is a matter of necessitie,

that we should be euer alone when we pray, for where our Lorde saide we should enter into our chamber to make our prayers, it was spoken onely to reprehend hypocrites, which vsed to knele praying openly at the endes of stretes,  with their solemne and counterfeite deuotion, to make the peo|ple returne to beholde them, to admire them, and to repute them for men of a holy life. For we se that GOD hath appointed the Churche for Christians to assemble in. And albeit in all places deuout and earnest prayers are accep|table vnto him, yet wee are bound to goe seeke him in the holy Church ordeined to that end: where, either by reason of the most holy Sacramentes, whiche are there often cele|brated, either by reason of the deuout prayers of others, we are stirred vp to prayer with more feruent zeale and affecti|on. Besides, we se that the religious do not make their prai|ers apart, but by the ordinances of the Church they assemble togeather in one Quire: where ioyning their voyces toge|ther, they make as it were of many mindes one onely. framing a harmonie of diuine prayses and deuout praiers, for the peace of GOD, for the saluation of mankinde. And that congregation doeth not onely call men dayly from their worldly workes to diuine seruice, but besides, hath great power, and is verie acceptable in the sight of God. Where|vpon some haue saide, that it is impossible, the praiers made by many together shoulde not be graunted. Neither doeth it any thing remooue me out of my setled opinion, the example which you propose of many, who of fleshly are become spiri|tuall, of wealthie are willingly entred into miserie, and from their stately Palaces, haue vowed themselues to beg|gerly monasteries: for these same though they haue the name of solitarie, for that they are seuered from vs in this tempo|rall life, yet they are gathered and assembled togeather in their Couents, where they not onely liue and pray together amongest themselues, but also vse conuersation with vs, in preaching, teaching, and doeing other thinges which ap|perteine to the profite of our soules. On the other side, we secular men which haue more inticements to do amisse, must

consider, that God hath giuen, is Roses beset with thornes, the swete with the sower, and hath giuen vs vnderstanding to discerne their qualities  difference. And though it were so that (as you say) a man can neither se nor heare the thing, which maketh not the right way to saluation rugged  vnea|sie, yet for all that, a good Christian ought not to stray out of it, but to haue in minde this saying, That euerie commodi|tie, bringeth with it a discommoditie. And when he seeth him selfe assailed either with the temptation of pleasures, or the vexation of troubles, then is the time to get the garland, by breaking in sunder those hookes, and holdbacks you spake of but now, for you know we must enter into the kingdome of heauen through tribulations  troubles. And although he do wisely, who, to fly the combat of the fleshe against the spi|rit, retireth into some obscure  solitarie place, yet co~sider the great vertue  singular merite of him, who being placed in the midst of pleasures, forbeareth them,  maketh a conquest of him selfe:  think also with your selfe, how curious these solitary men are of their quiet, who wil neither se nor heare the plaintes of other, neither are partakers of our losse and hurts, neither are subiect to the iniuries, the threates, the blowes, the persecutions, the outrages, daungers,  ruines, which this poore vale of miserie is full of. Neither likewise doth the example of those first fathers make against me, who were not so giuen to solitarinesse, but that they had a care o|uer their neighbors, which they manifested by more workes then you haue ned to heare, or I leasure to count. I deny not but Adam was happie, while he liued in solitarinesse, but for all that, you do not perceiue, that God in giuing him compa|ny, ment also to shew vnto vs, that Conuersation liked him wel. The last example of Christ co~teines in it a hidden mea|ning, different fro~ the doings of men, for in praying, fasting, and mourning in the wildernesse, his meaning was, if I bee not deceiued, to let a Christia~ know, that to reape the fruites of those labours, it behooueth him to solitary him selfe from sin:  calling his wa~dring mind to this reckoning, it behoueth him to kepe it solitarie from al other thoughtes. For if with

the sadnesse of the countenance, the fasting of the body, and the prayers of the mouth, the heart neither prayeth, fasteth, nor mourneth, Christ is not imitated, but it is the act of an hypocrite, who as the Poet saieth, couereth his conceits with a contrarie cloake. And if besides these woorkes of Christ he had not ben conuersable, it had not gone well with vs: for that disputing, preaching, healing the sicke, making the blinde to se, raysing the dead to life, he was conuersant amongst vs, the space of so many yeres, with so many discommodities: and in the ende shed his innocent blood for our redemptio~. Seing then while he liued amongst vs, he left vs an example and way, which we ought to vse in conuersation, in my opinion you were to blame to curse him, who first with so great discretio~ gathered together the scattered people, which had not (I confesse) the knowledge of vices which raigne in cities and townes, marry no more had they the knowledge of sciences, of honest and ciuile behaui|our, of friendship, of handicrafts, of woorkemanships, by meanes whereof they made themselues differ from sauadge beasts, whom before they did resemble. And therfore it may iustly be saide, that who so leaueth the ciuile society to place himselfe in some solitarie desert, taketh as it were the forme of a beast, and in a certaine manner putteth vppon him selfe a brutishe nature. So the common saying is, that there is no other name mete for a solitarie person, but either of a beast, or a tyrant. For that he doeth violence to beasts, seasing and possessing himselfe of forrests, of tops of mountaines, of their dennes, caues, and blinde aby|dings: Not seing that the citie and assemblies of people are made to founde the temple of iustice, and to appoint a law and forme to mans life, which before was disordered,  imperfect. You adde afterward, that learned men, and those of good wits, make no account but of the solitarie life, and you bring forth the philosophers, comtemners of the multitude, and louers of solitarinesse. I might heere take large scope to make you answere, but vsing al the briefnesse I can, I say only, that those excellent men in learning and science loue so|litary

places not by nature, but for lacke of their like, with whom they may be conuersant: and I graunt you that there is nothing more displeasant to the learned, then the companie of the ignorant: which falleth out of the great di|uersitie and difference which is betwene them. But as the learned flye the ignorant, so they willingly seke the compa|nie of other that are learned, with whom, stirred by a cer|taine vertuous ambition, they make proofe of their know|ledge, giuing and taking of the fruites which they haue ga|thered with long trauaile. You can not name me any Phi|losopher so hard laced, and so rebellious against nature, who, when time and place serued, had not conuersation eyther with his schollers to teache, or with other Philosophers to reason, and to heare their reasons, and which was not desi|rous to haue others followers of his doctrine. And therfore the doing of Diogenes, which you haue rehearsed, serued wel to shewe, that a Philosopher is contrary to the multitude, but not to disallowe conuersation, which he more accounted of then other Philosophers did. Wherefore I conclude, that if the learned and students loue solitarinesse for lacke of their like, yet they naturally loue the companie of those which are their like: In so much that many of them haue trauailed farre with great labour, to speake with other learned men, whose bookes they had at home in their hou|ses. And though you alledge vnto me, of these, which haue refused promotions, and publike offices, thinking it a thing blameworthy to bring their fre minde into bondage, and to intangle it with the affaires of the worlde, yet there haue ben other excellent Philosophers, who by their wri|tings (which are yet extant) haue reprooued the opini|on of those aforesaide, and that not without great rea|son: for giuing themselues wholy to the studie of the scien|ces and contemplation, they altogether abandoned those persons, to whom by the Lawe of nature they were bounde to giue succour, and considered not that (man being borne not onely for himselfe, but for his Countrie,

parents and friends) he semeth either too farre in loue with him selfe, or too farre out of loue with others, which followeth not his proper nature to benefite others, being borne thervnto. And therefore this sentence is well woor|thy to be written in letters of golde, that Hee vtterly seketh his owne shame, who onely seeketh his owne pro|fite. Nowe if all the prayse of vertue consist in dooing, according to the opinion of the Philosophers, whereto serueth this dumbe and ydle Philosophie, whereof may be saide as of fayth, that without woorkes it is dead, and profiteth no body, no not so much as to him who hath gotten it? Who can not assure him selfe to haue learned any science, if he make it not knowen, and if he per|ceiue not that others which are learned allowe of it. And thereof commeth the prouerbe, Betweene treasure buried vnder the ground, and wisedom kept hidden in the heart, there is no difference at all. And it may be said that these same men resemble the couetous, which possesse treasure, but haue it not: and that they are greatly to blame, which knowing howe to doe well, doe it not. For as Musicke, which is not hearde, is not had in estimation: so that Phi|losopher meriteth no honour, which manifesteth not his knowledge. * Which Socrates knew very wel, who, though no way else he had deserued to be counted the wisest man of the world, yet he deserued it only for this, that he was the first which brought moral philosophy down fro~ heauen. For seing al the Philosophers bent to the conte~platio~ of nature, he not only framed himselfe to get wisdome, to liue wel,  to teach other to liue, but gaue himselfe altogether to the bringing to perfection this part of Philosophie, which is so profitable and necessarie to our common life, and made the worlde to se the open folly of those, who will rather hide a candel vnder a bushell, then set it on a Candlesticke. Be|sides you knowe that these which like not of companie, howe learned soeuer they be, take them from their schoole points, and matters of learning, shewe themselues

so insufficient and such beastly fooles that most commonly they giue occasion to euery man to laugh at them. I haue not yet forgotten many grosse follies of a Gentleman sometyme my Schoolefellowe at Pad. who in learning was not inferiour to any scholler in the Uniuersitie, but for the rest, you woulde haue sayde, that he had ben one of these Owles who stande in feare of other byrds: in so much that his sottishnesse mooued me to pitie him, especially one day, that hauing occasion to ride by hearing of the sodayne death of his father, he bought a paire of Bootes, whereof the one was so straite that it wroong his legge and foote very sore, and the other was a great way to wide: And as we blamed him that he woulde suffer him selfe so to be coose|ned: he answered, That he him selfe when hee bought his Bootes founde fault that there was suche oddes betwene them, but the shoemaker had sworne vnto him that the greatest Boote was made of such leather as woulde shrinke in the wearing, and the other, of a hyde that woulde so retch, that in lesse then twoo dayes it woulde be easier then the other: what say you of this? Doe you not thinke that these men may be called wise by learning, and fooles in re|spect of the common people. Therefore it was rightly saide of an ancient Poet, that experience is the father of wisedom, and memorie the mother, to shew, that it is nedeful for him which wil attaine to the knowledge of humane thinges, not only to be prouided of bookes, but besides, to haue vndoubted experience  practise touching the vnderstanding of thinges: which being knowen, ought to be receiued  kept in minde, thereby to be able afterwarde to giue him selfe counsaile, by the triall him selfe hath alredie made, and to guide him selfe and aide other, by the euents he hath before noted to haue followed of like causes. And if you will knowe that this is true, consider that not onely in the profession of vs Phisi|tions, but in other faculties likewise, speculation without practise is nothing certaine. But we giue more credite to an argument grounded on thinges, which wee haue tried by reason, then in the simple Doctrine of other.
And you who haue eaten much salt out of your owne house, are well able to iudge howe wise and discrete your trauaile hath made you, and howe much you differ from those who neuer heard the ringing of other belles then these here. And therefore to shewe the valour and wisedome of great Vlisses, with good reason it was saide to his immortall praise,
That many countries he had seene,
and in their manners wel was seene.
I thinke I haue sufficiently confuted your reasons, with|out I should force or straine my selfe, as I could very well, to make you a more peremptorie and waightie answere, which I will leaue to doe, thinking you are content with this, and that you haue spoken of this matter, rather to giue me to vnderstand your great wit, then to maintaine in good earnest this opinion: For the same which haue taught you this false doctrine, haue likewise taught you the true, and I am sure you are not ignora~t that Petrarch, notwithstanding all the prayses he attributeth to the solitary life, was not to learne, that without Conuersation our life woulde be de|fectuous. For he hath ben no such enemie to good company, but that these wordes haue escaped forth of his mouth,
Had I beene with her:
But that he hath frequented Courts, and entred into a|mitie with many Princes and Gentlemen, I speake not of Hierosme Vida, for that not so much in respect of the workes he hath written, being gotten alone by himselfe, as for the learning hee shewed by word of mouth in publike counsaile: and for that he had long time vsed the Court of Rome, and by his dedes giuen other good example to doe well, he hath gotten not onely the myter, vnder which he hath a great while gouerned the flocke committed vnto him, but besides, hath wonne the credite of a Prelate worthy of a higher de|gre. Moreouer, that he exalteth the solitary life, to the in|tent to shewe his great wit, in debasing it afterwards with diuers and inuincible reasons: amongst the which he affir|meth

that all beasts so soone as they are deliuered from their damme get vpon their fet, and are able to stand a high alon, which nature woulde not graunt to man, who, so soone as he is borne, nedeth the assistance and support of o|thers. If that reason be not sufficient, he addeth, that the same nature hath giuen speeche to man, not to the ende to speake to himselfe, which were to no purpose, but to the ende it might stande in steede towardes other. And you se that the tongue serueth vs to teache, to demaunde, to conferre, to traffike, to counsaile, to correct, to dispute, to iudge, and to expresse the affection of our hearte: meanes whereby men come to loue one another, and to linke them|selues together. And he concludeth at the end, that a man can not attaine to any science, if it be not taught him by some other. You se then (Gentleman) that conuersa|tion is not onely profitable, but moreouer necessary to the perfection of man, who must confesse that hee is lyke the Be which cannot liue alone. And therefore accor|ding to the graue opinion of the Stoikes, we must thinke that as all thinges vppon the earth are made for the vse of man, so man is created for the vse of man, to the intent that following nature as their guide and Mi|stres, they haue to succour one another, to communi|cate together common profites, in giuing and receiuing, vniting and binding themselues together by artes, occu|pations, and faculties: so that hee may repute himselfe an vnfortunate man, which hath not the meanes by con|uersation to purchase his owne profite and other mens: a punishement inflicted by the lawes on some offendors for a kinde of torment. For there is no greater affliction then to liue amongst men, and to be depriued of the ayde and companie of men. And to ende my talke, there is here on earth no pleasure to bee receiued without companie, which made Architas Tarentinus to say that if any might by Gods permission ascend to heauen, and there beholde the nature of the world, and the beautie of the starres, that sight woulde

be no great delight vnto him, if hee had not some or other to whom he might impart it and tel what he sawe. * You may perceiue then heereby, that neither aire, fire, nor water, af|foorde vs more aide in al our neds then conuersation doth. But if perchaunce al these things be not sufficient to prooue this matter vnto you, I am redy to bring you (touching this) many other reasons, so substantiall as these already rehear|sed.


Guaz.
I am forced to say with the Poet.

Neither yea neither nay, can I resolue flatly to say:

For notwithstanding I fele my selfe greafly comforted with your gentle discourse, yet there sticke in my stomacke some doubts, which make me say vnto you, that as the step|mother by extreeme hatred discerneth not the vertues of her sonne in law,  the mother by excessiue loue on the contrary side knoweth not the imperfections of her own sonne so you likewise shew your selfe to be surprised with the same passi|ons, to find fault with solitarinesse,  commend conuersatio~, for so much as you haue not told the good which  of y^e solitary life, nor the euill which commeth of conuersation. Wherefore to manifest and discouer that which you kepe secret, I say vnto you, that my meaning was not to defende and commend those persons, who, moued either by some so|daine toy which taketh them in the head or of some melan|choly humor, rather then of any good minde, doe altogether withdrawe themselues into solitary places, and take no keepe to knowe what we doe in the worlde: but I amount them for dead, or at least for men which are good neither for themselues nor other: and being not willing to put in prac|tise their vertue to their owne profite, nor to teache it to o|thers which stande in nede of it, I vse to compare them to the Foxe, who had rather  and breake his tayle against the ground to  profit, then to giue a little of it to the Ape to couer his priuy parts. Likewise I neuer meant to deny, but that in haunting the companie of men, a man may doe woorkes acceptable to GOD: my opinion was, and is

yet, that to the perfection of man (which if I be not deceiued consisteth chiefly in knowledge) solitarinesse is more auay|leable then conuersation. And for proofe thereof, you se howe those which busie themselues in the affaires of the worlde, are for the most parte without learning, and con|trariwise, those which couet to get learning, seeke it not in publike places amongest a multitude of men, but in their studies  priuie Chambers. Neither is it to purpose to say, that some learned, waxe sots and fooles in company, for that this foolishnesse is estemed to be so, onely by the vulgar sorte, who, seing them vnskilful howe to make courtesie af|ter the newe fashion, howe to set the cappe aside; howe to daunce in measure, and kepe time with the musike, and howe to stoute another finely, according to the common fashion, laugheth them to scorne and maketh small recko|ning of them: But for all that, they are fauoured and honou|red amongst other learned men, who take for plainnesse of manners and gentlenesse of minde, that which the common sote calleth foolishnesse. Nowe let vs turne the leafe, I pray you, and set one of these scoffers in the middest of a compa| of learned men, and you shall se him straightway, ei|ther to be stroke dumbe to his shame, or else to speake to his dishonour: like as hee, who being by chaunce amongest cer|taine learned men, which reasoned of the excellency of Po|ets, pricked forwarde by his owne ambitious ignorance, in|terrupted their talke, saying, that without any more conten|tion, Horace was to be preferred before all other Poets: for that Petrarch was of that opinion, and had already preferred him before Homer and Virgil: and beeing required to bring foorth that opinion of Petrarch, he answered foorthwith,
If Virgil and Homer had seene,
Horace alone gainst all Tuscane:
Wherevpon they fell to laughing more hartily, then the schollers your friends did for the iest of the bootes: and the laughter begunne afresh after, when being required to shew the meaning of Petrarch in those verses, he added, that he meant to say that neither Virgil nor Homer, nor all the Po|ets

of Tuscane were able to incounter Horace alone. Nowe if the scholler fell into a certaine tollerable lightnesse of be|liefe, this fellowe stumbled vpon a corrupt persuasion in o|pinion. Whereby I am induced to thinke that learning without experience is more certaine, then experie~ce without learning, and I had rather haue the name of a simple schol|ler, then of an ignorant Courtier. Wherevpon I wil infer, that whosoeuer will attaine knowledge, and sounde the depth of it, must (as the artificers say) se to the shoppe, and not walke the stretes all the day long, and braue it out be|fore the people. But put the case that many commendable effects come of conuersation, yet put the discommendable in ballance against them, and they will ouerway them a great deale. For that the number of the good is so smal and scant, that though you be neuer so well giuen, you cannot continue so, but you shalbe driuen to change, and to thinke with your selfe that he which slepeth with the dogs, must rise with the fles. And hereof the Crerensians being assured, whe~ they wished ill to any, they forspake him that he should take delight in haunting ill companie, meaning, that there|by hee shoulde come to confusion. Besides that we are now growen to this point that you can not behaue your selfe so well, but that you shall receiue thousand iniuries, if not in life (which is not it selfe very safely warranted) yet at least in good name. And at this day the malice of men is so great, that they spare not the honour of whosoeuer it bee, whether Prince or priuate person, and thinke smisterly and preposterously of all the good dedes which are wrought: in such sorte that if you addict your selfe to deuotion, and the exercise of charitie, you are taken for an hypocrite. If you be affable and courteous, you shalbe called a flatterer. If you succour any desolate widowe, you shall by and by heare a voice which saith: I knowe what foloweth. If through hed|lesnesse you resolute not a friend, hee will speake no more to you. If you defend one that is oppressed, take hede you bee not taken out of your house at vndue tyme. Thinke not to be spared for that you make not profession of a souldiour: for

now they wil not stick to beate euen doctors and aduocates, to hinder them from defending their clyents. But to what end goe I to loose my selfe in the intricate labirinth of the a|buses  disorders of our time. I wil get out presently,  per|swade my selfe, that vices should be banished out of y^e world, if conuersation were taken out of it: seing that adulteries, robberies, violences, blasphemies, murthers, and infinite o|ther euils, are learned by the conuersation of men, and by meanes of the same are committed.


Annib.
You made a shewe at the beginning to yeld vn|to me, and yet neuerthelesse are risen against me with a se|cond assault. But notwithstanding I will not cease to assay with other answeres, to set an ende (if it be possible) to our controuersie. And for that you grounde learning vppon soli|tarinesse, I must first aske you, of whome the principles of sciences and learning are for the most part learned?


Guaz.
Of Maisters.


Annib.
You shall be then taken in your owne net, se|ing by these words you graunt vnto me, that the beginning and end of learning dependeth of conuersation. And verily as the armourer can not assure him selfe of the goodnesse of a corselet, vntill such time as he hath sene it prooued with the launce or harquebouse: so neither can a learned man assure him selfe of his learning, vntill he mete with other learned men, and by discoursing and reasoning with them, be acer|tained of his sufficiencie. Whereby it semeth to me verie clere, that conuersation is the beginning and end of know|ledge. But for that you adde, that men conuersant in the Court and common wealth are voide of learning, I must put you in minde touching y^e point, that as there are diuers sciences, artes,  professions, so likewise is the life of men di|uers, who as it pleaseth god, are called some to merchandise, some to warfare, some to phisicke, some to the lawes. And for that all these tend to one ende, to get by these meanes ho|nour and profite, you se that euery one of these diuideth his life into two partes: the one, to learne those thinges which may serue to lead him to the end I haue spoken of the other,

to put them in practise. And for example, you haue alredie purposed with your selfe to be Secretarie to a Prince, I am not ignorant, that by reason of the good partes which are in you, you are to looke for reputation and commoditie therby, and to bethinke you of the good hap of those, who from that degre haue ben raysed to Cardinals and Uicars of Christ. And therefore to make your selfe fit for that office, you haue learned the Latin and Tuscane tongue, and so many arts as are necessarie for that purpose: and by your perfect style in wryting,  great discretion in handling matters, you haue wonne the reporte and name of an excellent Secretarie. All other men doe the like, amongest whom there are some, who giuing their mindes either to husbandry, or to merchandise, care for no more learning, but to reade, wryte, and cast a count. And albeit amongst learned men, these same are not able to discourse of Rhetorike or of Poetry, yet are they not therefore to bee blamed, neither may we say they are berea|ued the knowledge of good letters by reason of conuersation, for that from the keginning of their life they haue determi|ned not to meddle with studie, and it sufficeth them to be e|stemed wise, and well sene in their owne profession. But a scholler is well worthy to be laughed at, and reprooued, who applying him selfe altogether to studie, doeth not frame his learning to the common life, but sheweth him selfe altoge|ther ignorant of the affaires of the world. And I will say vn|to you moreouer, that it were a great errour to beleue, that learning is more gotten in solitarinesse amongest Bookes, then in the companie of learned men. For this is a maxime in Philosophy, and experience sheweth it, That learning is easilier gotten by the eares then by the eyes: neither should a man neede to dimme his sight, and weare his fingers in turning ouer the bookes of wryters, if he might alwayes se them present, and receiue by hearing that natural voyce, which by wonderfull force imprinteth it selfe in the minde. Besides that, if you chaunce to reade some harde and ob|scure place, you can not intreate the booke to expounde it vnto you, but you shalbe fayne sometime to goe your way

from it vnco~tented, saying, If thou wilt not be vnderstood, I wil not vnderstande the. Whereby you may knowe that it is much better to talke with the liuing, than with the dead. Againe I note this, that the spirite of a solitarie man waxeth dul  lither, hauing none to stirre it vp  awake it in demanding some question touching his learning, and in rea|soning vpo~ it: or else he waxeth hautie  proude by vaine be|liefe, for not comparing any with himselfe, hee attribu|teth too much to himself. On the contrary side, he which hea|reth other to commend his studies, hath them in more admi|ration: hee which is reprehended, amendeth his faultes: hee which is any thing negligent, is pricked forwarde by his cor|riuals which seke to outgoe him in glory. And as hee thin|keth it a great shame to come behind his equals, so doeth hee count it a great honour to bee able to goe before his betters. But aboue al other things the commendable controuersies which arise amongst learned men haue most force to quicken the spirits. For by disputing they learne,  that which they learne in that manner, they vnderstande best, they expounde best, and remember best. And while they dispute by liuely reasons, indeuouring to get the vpper hand ech of other, the perfect knowledge of things is come by,  thervpo~ it is com|monly saide that Disputation is the sifter out of the trueth. And for so much as the trueth is taken fro~ the common con|sent  opinions of men, those opinions can not be knowe~ but by conuersation and companie, which the Poets meant to shew and infer, reporting that though Iupiter was God om|nipotent, yet he called the other gods to counsaile, and heard their opinions. But let vs set fables aside, doe we not knowe that the waighty  wonderful institutio~s of the holy church procede not from the Pope onely, but from the holy general counsailes where they haue bin discretly wayed,  allowed? Besides, is it not the fashio~ of al princes, where there is que|stion of the affaires of their estates, because they wil doe no|thing of their owne heads, to assemble their counsailours,  to determine matters according to their aduise? Common|weales, Cities, yea smal townes, do they not assemble toge|ther

to choose officers,  to establish orders by common con|sent? Is it not the vse of Magistrates to take the common aduise and opinion of their assistentes, and we phisitions do we not the like in our assemblies  Colledges, wherein wee take resolutio~ touching the healing of the sicke, by the aduise and iudgement of the greater part? Did not Apelles take de|light to set his pictures abroade,  to throud himself secretly nere vnto the~, to heare the opinion of the beholders,  when many were of one mind in reprehending some part, did not hee mend it according to the common voices and opinions? * And did not another painter say, that the people was the maister of whom he had learned his art? * And lastly, was it not the vse of a wise Emperour (whose name I now remem|ber not) to send spies abroade euery day, to harke~ what was said of him, altering somtimes vpon that occasion his maner of dealings, and reforming his life from good to better, accor|ding to the reports were made vnto him? Uerily, he hazar|deth too much, who reposeth himselfe in his own iudgement. And it is a co~mon saying, that he doth wel, which cou~sayleth himselfe wel: For which cause counsel is estemed for a holy thing. I am not able sufficiently to expresse the great good, which commeth of conuersatio~,  of y^e knowledge which en|treth in by the eares  sinketh into the mind, comming from the mouth of learned men. But I wil tel  remember you of the honorable Academies, or Uniuersities, which for that purpose haue been instituted in many cities of Ialy, amongst which we must not forget to speake of that in Mantua, fou~|ded in the house of the most famous Lord Caesar Genzaga, a mightie prince, and a special patrone of learned men: neither that in Pauia, which flourisheth prosperously, by reason of the great nu~ber of students. But perchance it is a thing to be meruailed at, y^ in that litle citie of Casal the Academie of y^e Illustrati maketh so galla~t a shew. But for that the time ser|ueth not to speake of the excellencie therof, to returne to the matter in question, I say, that the fruite which is gathered by these Academies, is inestimable, and that they know wel what they do, which haue any doings in them. For knowing that one alone cannot of himselfe attaine to many sciences,

for that an art is long, and life is short, there they may ob|taine whatsoeuer they desire. For some discoursing of diui|nitie, some of humanitie, some of Philosophy, some of Poe|try, and other diuers matters, they partake mutually  in co~mon, of that which euery one priuately with great paine  long study hath learned: by the example of those, who being not able to liue of themselues,  make good cheere at their ta|ble, met together with other of their neighbors in one place,  bring euery one their cates with them, and thereof make a suptuous feast. And therfore it hath bin very profondly said, y^t man is a god vnto ma~, for that one receiueth so great plea|sure and comfort of another. Which selfe thing is represen|ted vnto vs by the picture of the blinde man, carying vppon his backe the lame creple, who teacheth him the way: and thervpon wel saith, Almanni.

So of twoo halfes the whole is fitly made,
the one with eyes, the other with feete doth aide.

I say then againe, that conuersation is the full perfection of learning, and that it more auayleth a student to discourse one houre with his like, then to studie a whole day by him|selfe in his studie. Yea and in conferring with his compani|ons, if he haue vnderstood any thing amisse, he therby most commonly commeth to the right meaning of the matter,  clereth his minde of many errours, * and beginneth to per|ceiue that the iudgement of one alone may bee easily darke|ned with the veile of ignorance, or of some passion, and that amongst a multitude, it seldome falleth out that all are blin|ded: and finally, vpon proofe he knoweth that vertue  know|ledge set foorth in bookes, is naught else then a painted ver|tue: and that true vertue and learning, is gotten rather by practise then by reading. * But it is nowe time to answere you, touching the inconueniences which are incurred (as you say) by conuersaio~, which make vs turne out of y^e right way,  alter our good purposes, by acco~panying with men of lewde behauiour. And though in my fancie you might satis|fie your self with some reasons alreadie alledged, yet I will say further y^t it is true, y^t as some diseases of y^e body are infec+tious, so y^e vices of the minde take fro~ one to another, so that

a drunkard draweth his companions to loue wine, a Carpet knight corrupteth  effeminateth a valiant man:  so much force hath co~tinual conuersation, that oft times against our wils, we imitate the vices of others. Therevpon it is saide, that the friends and familiers of Aristotle had learned to stammer: the friends of Alexander in discoursing, had got his roughnesse of spech: and dout not, but in haunting the com|panie of the euil, a man shal find by experience that a man is a woolfe to a man, not a God as I said before,  y^ according to the prouerbe, A friend of fooles wil become like vnto the~, *  hee which toucheth pitch shalbe defiled therwith. * But in like case also,  by the same reason on the contrary side, ver|tue bringeth forth the like effect. * And as a dead coale, laied to a liuely, kindleth: so a naughty person meeting in co~panie with the good, partaketh with their conditions. * Neither is a good aire  a mans owne natiue soile more helpeful to the health of the body, then the conuersation  co~panie of y^e good is to diseased minds. For if the ill leaue some sede of their naughtines with those that cleaue to them, by the same rea|son the good leaue behinde of their goodnesse, with those that frequent them. And as from muske there commeth a swete smel to delight the nose, so fro~ the good there goeth a certaine goodnes towards those that are nere the~,  most commonly keepeth it selfe stil within them. Now for that the ground of your reasons is, for that in conuersation a man cannot do so good workes, but that they shalbe taken against the heare,  wrongly interpreted, adding the dangers, hurts,  damages wherto they are subiect, which vse companie: I graunt here vnto you, that the good order and manner of liuing, is in a maner quite lost, but the fault  peruersnes of other, should neuer make you repent your self of doing wel: and let speake who list, neuer take care of the censures and reprehensions w^c come fro~ the blind communalty, which as ignora~t, taketh euery thing arsiuersie. But you ought to folow y^e allowable sente~ce of y^e Epicure, whe~ he saith, I neuer coueted to please the people, for y^t they esteme not y^e things, which I knowe,  for y^t I knowe not the things which they esteme  co~mend.

Besides, you must co~sider whether being withdrawne from company, and leading a solitarie life, you shall liue in securi|tie, and be exempt from the iniuries of the wicked. Nay loke not for it hardly, and assure your selfe, that for one yll word receiued in company, you shall receiue a thousand liuing so|litarily. For some one will not sticke to say (and perchance with some litle likelihood) that you haue about you some fil|thy disease, or that you haue committed some offence, and that you flye the light like a reremouse: others wil say, that you are an heretike, for that you eschue the company of Chri|stians, and they will seeke to put you into the Inquisition: others will call you an Alcumist, or a forger of money: and if all these suspicions aforesaid faile, yet at least you shal be thought either fainte hearted, either stately, either fantasti|call, either melancholike, or els a bruite beast: for that all these most commonly flye the company of men. So that by that meane you shal finde your selfe to be fallen (as the com|mon prouerbe is) Out of the frying pan into the fire, or out of a feuer into the hot euil  you shal be faine in the ende to return to the ordinary life, being resolued to thrust your self forwarde, and to liue vprightly and well in spight of those that liue yll: whose naughtinesse set against your vertue and goodnesse, will make it more excellent and famous, and you shall reioyce more to your selfe, to se that your vertue hath woon the victorie in the combate  opposition, you persisting in your goodnes in the midst of their naughtinesse. You must consider it deserueth no great praise nor merit, to know how to be good amongst the good, Mary it is somewhat worth to be good amongst the yll. Also you must thinke, that amongst those false consterers, there wil be some vpright iudge  de|fendour of your dedes. And though all the men of the world should faile you, yet the high iudgement of God wil not faile you; in whom if you shall once repose your trust, you may be sure he wil holde his hande ouer you, and defend you against the malicious and slaunderous, and in spight of them will bring the trueth to light, and giue it the vpper hande. As I think I haue fully answered you, and therfore without any

farther speech, you may know that to get wisedome to come by he accomplishment of learning  to come to dignitie, ri|ches,  worldly promotions, Conuersation is expedient. For to say, that euery man should haue an eye only to his owne affaires, is nothing els, but to make man like to beasts. And besides, it is most certaine, that solitarinesse putteth many euil thinges into our heades, and maketh vs beleue that which is not. Neither hath it any thing in it but horror and terrour, enemies to nature. According whereto, it is daily sene that a man being by him selfe is fearefull, and being in company, is couragious. * Yea,  being alone, is often temp|ted to commit many euils. Which, one Crates rightly signi|fied, who seing a young man walke in a secrete place, asked him what he did there so alone: the young man answered, that he talked with him selfe: I pray you (saieth he) take hede you talke not with some naughtie fellow. What shall I say more? But that the hearbe Helleborum may be giuen as well to the solitary, as to the foole. And whosoeuer shall marke these reasons, and specially the Etymologie of this worde Homo, (which in the Greke tongue as some lear|ned writers thinke) signifieth (together) shall perceiue, that a man can not be a right man without Conuersation. For he that vseth not company hath no experience, he that hath no experience, hath no iudgement,  hee that hath no iudge|ment, is no better then a beast.


Guaz.
I think the Northeast winde doeth not so driue in sunder the cloudes in the skie, as you, clearing altogether my minde, haue nowe driuen away the mystes which dim|med it,  made it so wandring  running, for the loue it had to solitarinesse. I perceiue the conclusion of your gentle dis|course semeth to be, that solitarinesse ought to be taken alto|gether out of the world,  company  conuersation to be cho|sen, as wel for the health of the minde as the body. And yet for all that, I se not how that may be granted vnto you, for that there are some times wherin solitarinesse is not only auaile|able, but necessary, both to the inward and outward welfare and prosperous state of life, so that I thinke it met to make

some mention hereof.


Annib.
Doe you not remember that I told you at the beginning of our talke, that to make euident y^e matter which hangeth doubtful betwene vs, and to resolue our selues tho|rowly of it, we must come to distinguish of solitarinesse and Conuersation.


Guaz.
It is very true.


Annib.
It is for that I would tel you now, that hence|forward it was time to leaue our generall discourse,  come to the particularities which we haue already proposed, that there may no co~fusion remain between vs. I then co~fesse vn|to you, y^e solitarinesse is not altogether to be blamed or bani|shed,  that it is at some time (as you say) profitable  neces|sary. And therfore we must first vnderstande, y^t a man some|time hath company being by himself and in solitarinesse, and sometime is solitary being in company or Conuersation.


Guaz.
Pardon me if I interrupt you, these speches  di|stinctions seme to me to be riddles, therefore you must serue me in steed of Aedipus, to read them.


Annib.
I wil explane them to you,  first I say, ther is one sort of solitarinesse so rare  perfect, that it is alwayes w^tout company  co~uersation, not at certain times: * whereinto it pleaseth some deuout men to enter, where being dead alto|gether to the world, chosing y^e best part  liuing alone (if they may be said to be alone which be with God) they ende their daies most pleasantly, in a life most vnpleasant. * And this ca~ no man attain vnto, without y^e special gift of god,  who that otherwise hazardeth to enter into it, exposeth him selfe to a great danger touching his own safegard,  hath no respect to this sente~ce, Wo be to the lone man, who whe~ he shalbe fal|len downe, shall haue none to helpe him vp. I will make no larger spech of this high kind of solitarinesse, referring my selfe to the long discourses which the diuines make of it, but descending to that lesse perfect solitarinesse, which is de|priued of Conuersation but for a certaine time. I finde ther|of thre kindes, to wit, solitarinesse of time, of place,  of the minde. Solitarinesse of time, is y^e stilnesse of the night, or the

instant wherein one speaketh alone in the presence of many: and this solitarinesse is (as you may iudge) no les profitable then necessarie to al sorts of persons, by reason of the things which are learned by word of mouth, as well of readers as of Preachers, and it is (as I saide before) of greater force and efficacy then the bookes and writings of Authours. Next, so|litarinesse of place, is the chamber or priuat dwelling which euerie one chooseth of purpose to sequester him selfe from the companie and conuersation of others. Here we haue to con|sider that men settle themselues in this solitarinesse of place for diuers respects, some to the intent to raise their thoughts from worldly vanities to the contemplation of God and his wonderful workes, to the ende to ioyne themselues to him with incredible ioy and health of soule, * and to comprehende that in minde which they cannot see with eye: * some to get with studie  speculation the fruit of learning, some to dis|course with them selues publike or priuate affaires. Al these solitarinesses of place taken  vsed in due season, haue great force to stir vp the spirits,  to prepare them a more easie and sure addresse to the works and actions belonging to conuer|satio~. * And if we co~sider diligently the fable of Prometheus, Iupiters Ambassador vpon the Mount Caucasus,  his heart torne by the Egle, we shall finde that by the Mount is figu|red vnto vs solitarinesse,  by the Egle co~templation, which woundeth the heart,  preyeth vpon it. Neither is any thing els ment by the co~iunction of the Moone with Endymion, but that he spent many nights in the contemplation of heauen|ly things, whereby he gathered the fruite of Astrologie. And the shoulders of Atlas wherewith he staied vp heauen, repre|sent vnto vs nothing els but the knowledge which he had of the superiour world by meanes of contemplation: * but these same notwithstanding they are solitary in respect of y^e place where they remain alone, yet they are in company in respect of the diuersitie of things which they ponder in their minde. And thervpo~ Scipio said, that he was neuer lesse alone, then when he was alone, for y^t being gotten by him self into some

solitarie place, he discoursed many thinges in his minde, per|teining to the increase of his honour. But I must tell you, that as this solitarinesse is profitable and necessarie for the disposition of the minde, so verie often is it hurtfull to the health of the bodie: and it is therefore I tolde you at the be|ginning of our talke, that you ought to auoyde it. For the finer wit a man is of, the more he beateth it (being alone) a|bout nice and intricate pointes, whereby his bodie may be brought into diuers dangerous diseases. Neither for all this will I affirme that this solitarinesse of place is chosen of all, to bestow them selues in laudable studies, and commen|dable speculations, for that there are some who hauing in their handes all day long bookes full of naughtinesse  leude examples, roote and inure them selues in this doctrine, and make an ordinarie practise of it: insomuch that these ill di|sposed persons may well say that they haue learned more naughtinesse being by them selues, then they should haue done being alwayes in companie in publike and frequen|ted places: but God be praysed, and the prouidence of our auncestours, who haue iustly condemned to the fire, all such workes, so soone as they are published, as instruments to all leaude and naughtie purposes. I must also tel you, that there are some choose solitarinesse through lazinesse of minde, and lazinesse of bodie, to the intent to rid their handes of the trauelles, affaires, and woorkes whiche they ought to vndertake for their owne behoofe and other mens. And these lurke loytringly plunged in delicacies, wherein they conserue them selues, not as Muske in a boxe, but as Swine in the mire. So that it may be saide, that their soule is giuen to their bodie in stead of salt, least they should smell. I haue knowne some of these idle merchauntes to withdrawe them selues from companie most parte of the day, taking pleasure to doe nothing, vnlesse it were to presse downe their beds with the peise of their vnwildie bodies: and yet (such is their impudencie) they will make men beleue that they haue employed

all the time in reading some good thing or other. I neuer be|holde these fellowes, but that I excuse and holde well with the Emperour Domitian, who taking. delight to thrust thorowe flies with the point of his dagger, did at least some exercise, and liked better to take paines to kil flies, then to suffer his minde to be corrupted with idlenesse. And if not|withstanding hee were to be blamed for this, it was not so much for the trifling exercise, as for y^t he left vndon weightie matters agreable to his greatnesse,  auaileable to the con|seruation of his Empire. * And heereof we haue to conclude, that euen as he which abandoneth the actiue life, to embrace the contemplatiue, meriteth praise: so he, which being in the actiue life refuseth companie, not vpon any honest occasion, but either for the hate he beareth to men, either through lazy slouthfulnesse, either through distrust in him selfe, or for some other defect, shrinketh aside into solitarinesse is great|ly to be reprehended. * But there is enough said touching so|litarinesse of place, it remayneth nowe to speake of so|litarinesse of minde, which is, when one is present in person amongst many others, and yet is absent in minde  thought. Like as a Philosopher was, to whom a babbling foole, after a long and wearisome discourse, saide, Sir, perchaunce I trouble you with to muche talke: no verily, not a whit (saith he) for that I gaue no eare to you.


Guaz.
I know in dede many which haue the skil with the eyes, countenance, gesture, and other outward signes, to make men think they are verie attentiue to their talke, and yet haue their mindes turned an other way, so that in one instant, they are both present and absent, contenting both them selues and other.


Annib.
Albeit this discretion is co~mon to many good wits, yet I remember that it is specially attributed to Madame Marguerite Stanga, and that this solitarinesse hath bene fi|gured foorth by a pleasant witted Gentleman in her person, who for the maiestie of her lookes, for the excellencie of her grace, bewtie, vertue, behauiour, and manners, is beheld of other dames of this Citie, if not with enuy, at least with ad|miratio~. And although in company she sheweth her self to be

present with countenance, laughing  speaking, yet by the outward shyning of her eyes, bewraying her inward affecti|on (as it were by shining of the cristal which sheweth forth whatsoeuer is contained in it) it is sene that her gallant mind separated from mortal things, remaineth inclosed in her self, to the intent to exercise her selfe in more worthy and commendable cogitations: taking from the world al occasio~ of co~ceiuing any hope to win her to vanity,  vpon y^e occasio~ y^ gentleman aforesaid deuiseth of her these verses folowing.

While that these cheereful eyes
fed on the wished sight,
Of your faire sweete and beauenly face
Behold my heauy spright:
Soone sawe your thoughts to swarue
from myne whereby I say,
At once you giue my eyes great life
and quyte my heart doe slay.

But returning to the solitarinesse of the mind, I woulde haue a wise man enter into it when he is in the company of the euil: fro~ hearing whose talke hee ought to stop his eares, as Vlisses did against the song of the Marmaides * and to walke amongst them (as the saying is) shood amongest the thornes. * And as wee lef not to take a iourney for a little raine or snowe, but make prouision so well as wee may for apparell to defende vs against the ill weather, so wee must not foreslow the pilgrimage of the ordinary life, for the hin|derance of the naughty, but arme our selues with an in|uincible minde against the euill dispositions of other, wher|too we ought not any thing at all to yelde. And for that I tolde you I woulde make mention likewise of Diogenes, I will declare vnto you the witty answeres which he made touching this purpose: amongest others, as one reprooued him for that hee vsed the companie of lewde and naughtie persons, The Sunne (sayth hee) shyneth and spreadeth it beames on vncleane places, and yet neuer defileth it selfe. And as another reproched him for the like, hee an|swered, The Phisitions are all day with the sicke, and yet

are not infected: and in trueth ill conditions take no holde of an honest minde, and a vertuous man wareth not woorse for being in companie with the wicked * who haue no pow|er ouer him. For that in vaine (as the Prouerb sayth) The net is pitcht in the sight of the birdes * in so much that bee|ing amongest them, he maketh account he is not there, accor|ding to the saying of the Gentleman, to whom as Esope tel|leth, being in his studie, there came a countrie fellow, who as|ked him how he could liue so alone? To whom hee answered, I began to be alone, but euen since your comming hither: Meaning to shewe that a learned man is then alone, when he is amongest the ignoraunt, from whom hee is deui|ded in minde. But it is nowe time to leaue spea|king of this matter, for that you vnderstand what manner of solitarinesse is profitable and necessary, and in what man|ner it is sometimes to be vsed in companie.


Guaz.
I am satisfied in that point, but I woulde glad|ly haue you bring to a perfect ende this imperfect discourse: for it is not ynough to haue made me know y^e co~uersation is profitable, if you goe not farther, and shewe me what kinde of conuersation is necessary for the obtaining of those com|modities you haue rehearsed.


Annib.
You say very true, but neuerthelesse when we shal haue spoken of the nature and qualitie of conuersation, yet our discourses; being linked together, shal not be thereby finished, for we must entreate afterwardes of the generall pointes which all men ought to obserue in conuersation. And that being done, yet shal not the work be finished, for as wee apply na one medicine to all griefes of the eyes, so wee must not vse conuersation with euery one in one selfe sorte: And therefore wee must afterwardes handle the particu|ler kindes which pertaine to all sortes of people.
Wherfore if you will haue mee distinguish peecemeale, the plant, the stemme, the boughes, the leaues, the blossomes, and the fruites, from the rootes of this tree, I leaue to your consideration if this may bee doone in one day.



Guaz.
For that this is a profitable and pleasant mat|ter, I besech you that in these thre dayes which I haue to stay here with you, we may imploy herein that little lea|sure which shalbe left you from practising on your patients: and that you will shewe vnto me all those things which be|long to conuersation, to the ende, that comming in company with any, of what calling and condition soeuer, I may bee sure to omit nothing whith I ought to perfourme.


Annib.
I cannot throughly satisfie your desire, for ma|ny causes: and first, for that to searche out all the particular points of conuersation, were a matter, if not impossible, yet at least that would require manie monethes worke: besides, we must consider that (as the Philosophers say) there can be no certaine and determinate science, from particular to par|ticular. Then the particularities of conuersation being knowne for the most part to men of meane vnderstanding, I should do you wrong,  should thinke my self to speake su|perfluously (yea, euen when I should speak to those ignorant and vnskilfull fellowes) if I should intreate of things so or|dinarie and common. And therefore it shal suffice vs to in|treate of those things which are principally required in con|uersation, wherewith perchance we shall haue occasion to mingle  ioyne so manie other bymatters, that I doubt not but you shall rest satisfied.


Guaz.
Uerily, I se by this time that as well for the di|uersitie of matters which occurre in conuersation, as for the difference of the life  manners of men, with whom we are conuersant, you shall take vpon you a trauell  charge farre greater than the twelue labors of Hercules, throughly to in|treate of it. For considering that people differ one from ano|ther in degree, in age, in kinde, in life, in maners, and in pro|fession, it were a hard  tedious pece of worke to set downe fully and absolutely the proper dueties of euery one of these, and of whosoeuer shall frequent their companie. And I am of opinion, that when one shall haue prescribed a certaine fourme of conuersation to all those, yet he shal not then haue doone, for that there must be repect has not onely to the dif|ference

which is betwene one kind and another, but to that also which is betwene persons of one onely kinde: for not onely young men differ in behauiour from olde, and Gentle|men from Yomen: but euen young men amongest them|selues differ, as also one olde man differeth in behauiour from another olde man, and one Gentleman from another Gentleman.


Annib.
Seeing that these differences fall out in all kindes, I will briefly set foorth certaine generall and most nedefull meanes, whereby all of them may be reduced to one law: Touching the fourme afterward required in con|uersation, with persons different in state and condition, whom we haue alreadie named, to the end you bee not de|ceiued, you shal vnderstand, my meaning is not to discourse formally of their duetie, neither to lay before you all those morall vertues which pertaine to the perfection and hap|py state of life.


Guaz.
Why deferre you to speake of a matter so profi|table.


Annib.
Two speciall causes withholde me: the one, for that I know that not onely the Greekes Latines, but also all other nations haue filled the worlde with diuers vo|lumes full of precepts of Philosophie.


Guaz.
The more bookes of Philosophie we haue at this day, the fewer Philosophers we haue but tell me if it please you, the other cause.


Annib.
The other is, that if I should make a ful  per|fect discourse of Morall Philosophie, it would stande none in stede, but such as are of deep vnderstanding, as you are, but minding to speake in particular, of the manners of conuer|sation mete for all sortes of people, it behooueth me to haue an eye to the common profite, weighing that the most parte of men, is not only destitute of intellectuall and morall ver|tues, but besides, is neither in wit apte, nor in wil desirous to receiue them, so that it were a vaine thing (that I may not say foolishe) to goe about to teache by Art, and improper tearmes, theforesaide vertues to such kinde of people,



Guaz.
I holde well with that you haue saide, and for that perchance the time approcheth, that you are to visite your patientes, it shall doe well heere to make a pause, and to morrowe if it please you, wee will take againe our mat|ter in hand, either here, or at your house at your choice.


Annib.
If it shal not trouble you, I can stay heere with you a little while longer, and we can choose no fitter place for our purpose then this same, which with the goodly sight of diuerse pleasant pictures (wherwith it is adorned) doth mer|uellously recreate or mindes, and ministreth occasion of wit|ty talke.


Guaz.
Goe forwarde (I pray you) hardly so farre as it shall please you, for I assure you I neuer hearde more de|lightful harmonie then this same.


Annib.
For so much then as your question was what manner of conuersatio~ is necessarie for the attaining of that perfection which we haue spoke~ of, I set a part al other sorts, and propose for this purpose the ciuile conuersation.


Guaz.
What meane you by that woord, Ciuile?


Annib.
If you meane to know my meaning of it, I must first aske if you know * any citizen which liueth vciuilly?


Guaz.
Yes mary doe I, more then one.


Annib.
Now let me aske you on the contrarie, if you know any man of the countrey which liueth ciuilly.


Guaz.
Yea very many *.


Annib.
You se then, that we giue a large sense  signifi|cation to this woorde (ciuile) for that we would haue vnder|stoode, that to liue ciuilly, is not sayde in respect of the citie, but of the quallities of the minde: so I vnderstand ciuile con|uersation not hauing relation to the citie, but consideration to the maners and conditions which make it ciuile. And as lawes and ciuile ordinances are distributed not onely to ci|ties, but to villages, castles, and people subiect vnto them, so I will that ciuile conuersation appertaine not onely to men inhabiting cities, but too all sortes of persons of what place, or of what calling soeuer they are
Too bee shorte, my meaning is, that ciuile conuersation

is an honest commendable and vertuous kinde of liuing in the world.


Guaz.
I know by this your exposition of this woorde (Ciuile) the fielde we haue to enter into, is very wide and roomesome, and therfore I am ready to giue eare to matters no lesse ful of varietie and newenesse, than commoditie and pleasantnesse.


Annib.
As Marriners, before all other thinges, learne to know the signes and tokens of windes and stormes, and the sight and place of rockes and shelues, and al other things any way contrarie or hindersome to nauigation, to the ende that foreseing the imminent dangers, they may know how to auoide them, and to make choice of ft times and places prosperously to sayle in: so we, being desirous to vnderstand thorowly which is the ciuile conuersation, to the intent to follow it, must principally seke to knowe which is the vn|ciuile and blameful conuersation, to the intent to flee it. And truely wee ought to auoyde yll companie, as well for the hurt which is receiued thereby, by the infection of naughtie conditions, as for the iudgement and opinion of others: for that wee are at length taken for such as those are with whom we keepe companie. Which this common Prouerb sheweth, Tel me with whom thou doest goe, and I shall know what thou doest. And it is not long since that maister Frauncis Pugiella or Academike (being no lesse skilled in the lawes, then pleasant in companie) tolde me that a fa|mous doctour of his profession, set it downe as an vndoub|ted sentence, that much credit ought to be giuen to the depo|sition of a witnesse which giueth in euidence of a mans ho|nestie or dishonesty, for that he hath seene him frequent the co~mpanie of men of a good or yll name. Now I woulde not haue you blame me, if in searching out which is yll compa|nie, I make heere a certaine distinction of men according to mine owne fansie, not according to the common and or|dinarie distinction. For I consider the nature of man one waye in respect of him selfe, and an other way in respect of the conuersation he hath wih others hauing then one|ly

regarde to conuersation, I ordeine three sortes of men, to whom we will giue for the present these names. Good, Euill, and Indifferent, vntil we meete with woordes more proper and more significant.


Guaz.
Why doe you thinke those tearmes not proper ynough?


Annib.
For that these two names, Good, and Indiffe|rent serue not to expresse fully that sorte of men whiche I meane: and to shewe it you more plainely, I wil giue you an instance of healthy men, which are properly those, who haue the foure humours so equally tempered in them, and the simple partes which come of them (besides the other partes which wee call compounde, or instrumentall, whiche are the very members of the body) so wel proportioned, that one thing excede not another in it iust measure: and this health is graunted either neuer, or very seldome, and that to a fewe persons. But for all that, we commonly tearme those healthfull, who though they be not of so perfect a con|stitution of body, are able to liue, yea, and to labour too, the most part of their time, without any going to Phisicke: and (to be short) who holde more of the whole then of the sicke. So likewise when I name the good, I meane not one|ly that excellencie of goodnesse, which is not any way imper|fect, and which is in a manner as rare on earth as the Phoe|nix: but I include in that number, all those which are well reported and reputed of in the world, and which approch so nere as they can to that excellencie before spoken of. In like case, when I saide indifferent, I meant not that they are halfe good, and halfe euill, * neither as a certaine Historian taketh it, who speaking of the Emperour Galba, tearmeth his disposition indifferent, for that comparing his vertues  his vices together, it was hard to iudge whether he were to be counted amongst the good or the naughtie: * but I meant those, who though sprinckled with some imperfecti|ons, yet wrie rather to the good, then the euill.


Guaz.
I se well now that these names doe not wholy expresse your meaning.



Annib.
It may be that in discoursing we shall hit vp|pon more fit tearmes. In the meane while I say, that wee must alwaies followe the good, flie the yll, and neither followe nor flie the indifferent, and were it not that I were afraide to breake the head of your Boccace, I would call the Good desireable,  the Ill, intollerable, and the Indifferent, tollerable.


Guaz.
You shall offende Boccace rather with the vn|propernes, then with the vnusualnes of words. And for my part, I like better of these same then of the first: whereby I finde verified the Prouerbe, Thar the second thoughtes are euer the best: Goe forwarde nowe if it please you.


Annib.
I take the Intollerable and Ill, for those who for their apparent faultes are pointed at with the finger, and holden for infamous, whose companie we ought altogether to eschew. For al y^e world cannot let, but that the world wil iudge those which haunt their co~panie to be like vnto them.


Guaz.
The abuse of the world is such, that many horrible vices, are become familiar and common, insomuch that it is counted a fault not to haue them, and not to know howe to practise them. And therefore I am of opinion, that if wee must forgoe the company of the yll, we shall haue but a few left to deale withall: insomuch that wee shoulde bee faine to change conuersation into solitarinesse, and to discende to particularities. You know how greuous the offences are co~mitted against God, by the meanes of blasphemous othes, which at this day are growne to suche abuse, that there are few or none which co~firme not their saiyngs with these wic|ked  detestable swearings, and which thinke not therby to bewtifie and set foorth their speach, as an Oration is with fi|gures. Neither am I able to report vnto you in what maner a young Gentleman a friende of mine was mocked in the Court, for that in his greatest chafe, hee alwaies swore by the body of a Hen. And at the end, to the end he might be ta|ken for a good Courtier, he was driuen to leaue the Hen, and to betake himself to y^e Saints. That which I say of swering, I meane likewise of many other haynous faults, which at

this day are to be found in the most part of men. And for that they are co~mon, I feare me, it be to no purpose that you haue prescribed to auoid the company of the naughtie, seing that (if I may say it) Of one selfe pitch, we all haue a touch: And that those which in shew seme innocent lambes, are in deede rauening Wolues,  worse then those who are coun|ted most wicked. For euen infidels,  those that beleue not at all in Christe, will counterfeite holinesse.


Annib.
* We are in dede become more weake in ver|tue, and more strong in vice, then our predecessours were, * and I se by you, you haue read the sentence of the Poet Ho|race, which saith:
From Grandsiers scarce good, our fathers descended,
to commit euill, are readily intended:
In vs their sonnes more mischiefe doeth dwell.
but vs, our sonnes in vice will excell,
And therfore I maruell not, if where as in old time there were few found to blaspheme the name of the great God, at this day there are many which will not sticke to teare him limme meale, insomuch that he is thought either a Sot, or one of a base minde which cannot sweare lustily. But if ye aske me why these same are suffered in all companies, not|withstanding they are farre worse and farre more wor|thie of punishment then the other of euill life, I wil say vn|to you, that it co~meth to passe, for that we make no reconing of the offences doone to Godwarde, as a thing which tou|cheth vs not, and which perteineth to God alone to reuenge. But we cannot bee quiet when either wee our selues or our friends are iniured either in worde or dede, so that therein we esteme the creature aboue the Creator. For you shall se him speake yll openly,  with a lowd voice, of the name of God, who dareth not in a corner (as also it is not his part) so much as open his mouth to reprooue the Prince or the Magistrates.


Guaz.
I thinke these same offend as much, and commit no lesse ryot, then those which crucified Christe.


Annib.
I thinke rather they offende more, for those

thought they did well, otherwise they had kept them selues from doing it, but these same knowe they doe ill, and yet de|sist not from it: and you knowe howe much more haynous those faultes are which are committed of set malice, then those which are doone of blinde ignorance.


Guaz.
Dispatch I pray you to shew me if wee ought to flie the conuersation of these same,  if you put them in the number of the intollerable.


Annib.
These horrible swearers, which make a pro|fession of it, when their blood is not stirred, for their plea|sure, rather then mooued with choller, or any other occasion, ought in my iudgement to be filed on the roule of the intol|lerable: but for others, though as a Christian you ought to flie them, yet as a Courtier, you cannot kep you from them: not so much for the great number of them, as for the error of the world, which estemeth them in the rowe of the tolle|rable. To be short, we ought to consider that our name de|pendeth of the general opinions, which haue such force, that reason is of no force against them: and therfore we must a|uoide those which beare a marke in their forehead, and are openly knowne to be dishonest.


Guaz.
What will you say if I haunt the companie of such, as a Phisition to cure their infirmities,  as one gea|lous of their behauiour?


Annib.
If you shall think your selfe able to bring them into a better way, you shall do a dede acceptable vnto God, and the worlde, to vse their companie, * Mary, he that coueteth to reape commoditie of conuersation, must seke all that hee may to bee amongest those that either may bee made better by him, or els may make him better: * but these of whom I speake haue made a sacrifice of their soules vnto the Diuell, and haue cast of all care of honour, and of other mens opinions of them: and are so farre gone, that you wil rather become a conuert then a conuerter: but here|in you must imitate the good Archers, who shoote not at eue|ry birde, but only at those that are within reache to be hit.


Guaz.
What men doe you meane to be those which

cary a marke in their forehead, and are intollerable.


Annib.
Those who for notable cause are hated of the worlde, as some for suspition of heresie, some for theft, some for vsurie,  other for other misdedes, to whom we must adde ruffians, harlots, flatterers, dicers, cooseners, and such, who for the basenesse of their condition, and trade of their life, are holden for infamous, * as Sergeants, Hangmen, Tormentours. * Besides such as differ from vs in religion as Iewes, Turkes, c. And to be short, all those which haue an euill report, and who oftentimes for their desertes are newe christened, and haue suche reprochfull names giuen them, that most men eschew their company an as infectious disease, * and thinke it a great shame to bee sene among them. *


Guaz.
But howe shall I behaue my selfe with some. whom I knowe farre more wicked then those whom you haue spoken of, albeit by their dissembling hypocrisie, they are accounted of euery man for honest men?


Annib.
It is a common saying, That he which is euill and taken to be good, may doe muche mischiefe, and no man thinke him to be the worker of it. Notwithstanding, I put these same in the number of the tollerable: for though it trouble your conscience to come in their companie, yet you giue no occasion of mislike to the worlde, for that they are not reputed euill, and in this point we ought to satisfie ra|ther others then our selues, and to giue place to the com|mon custome.


Guaz.
Doubtlesse custome is a great Tyrant, and I knowe no reason why it ought to preuaile aboue reason. And * as the riuer Po, king of riuers, being ouer nere vnto vs, for that there hath bene no resistance made against it, is within this sixe yeres come so farre forward, and hath wonne so muche grounde vpon this Citie, that at length it hath broken the walles, and nowe threatneth to ouerthrow them: so in like maner, the violence of custome, for that we haue too much suffered it, hath at this day in manner van|quished

reason, which to be true if you marke some coun|tries on this side the mountaines, as I did at my returne out of France, you shall finde them falne to a life more e (that I may not say licencious) then hath been vsed heere|tofore: and you se throughout the townes, some of those which are taken for Gentlemen to spende the time openly in the market place, in carding, and dicing so frely, as men vse to doe in their priuate houses.


Annib.
You tell mee no strange thing, neither ought you more to maruell to see those same play at those games openly in the strete, then to se the Frenchmen (as I haue hearde they doe) quaffe and carouse in Tauernes, and I am perswaded that if some Gentleman more precise then other shall withdraw himself from this maner of play, not vouch|sefing to make one amongest them, he shalbe mocked and termed disdainful, either a wise man, or Doctour, or a Poet, or some such like. But withall I woulde you shoulde knowe that this newe manner of life hath in it some colour and excuse, for that those Countries of Piemont, which you speake of hauing ben for these many yeeres, a continuall re|ceite for souldiers of many nations, the people are not only become warriers, but haue retained the customes and rytes of warre.


Guaz.
Are you then of opinion that a Gentleman ought to conuerse with such manner of people?


Annib.
Upon this point, there present themselues vn|to me two contrarie reasons: For if I respect the common vse of the Countrie, which is nowe become auncient, and hath taken depe roote, wee cannot but put them in the num|ber of the desirable, and wee may boldly vse their company. On the other side, if I set my selfe to consider that this gamesome life is offensiue, and of euill example, and that in all other Countries the Gentlemen, and those which are well borne, woulde count it a shame to be founde in publike places with cardes in their handes, some perchance woulde place them in the ranke of the intollerable. Not|withstanding,

betwene these twoo extreme reasons, I se one in the middest betwene them, which maketh me of o|pinion that these men are to be counted tollerable, for that though they haue by vse this abuse of playing, yet you shall finde that they apply it not to that ende, which oher game|sters doe, to make a gaine of it, but for pastetime and re|creation sake: and besides we knowe that for the rest of their life, they are so modest and vertuous as any other peo|ple are. And therefore I thinke, that that custome of playing being iudged of the worlde neither good nor euill, these men which vse it are not to bee reiected out of honest companie.


Guaz.
In my opinion this is a kinde of iniustice, to al|lowe that to these which is inhibited to others: and to giue them power to make of vice vertue. Your meaning is then, as farre as I gather, that as it is lawefull onely for the Cin|ganes to robbe, so these also haue priuiledge to play in open strete. But I woulde haue them thinke that the stretes  publike places ought to serue the common people for mer|chandise, and the Gentlemen for iustes, turnies, shewes,  such like exercises, which appertaine more to good horseman|ship and warlike discipline, then cardes and dice doe. And therefore I am perswaded they haue nothing else to say, for defence of this their custome, but that which Diogenes said, who being asked why hee eate openly in the strete, answe|red because he was a hungred in the strete: so they play there, because being there, there commeth vpon them a de|sire to play.


Annib.
There is no helpe in it, but you must settle your selfe to like of such men with their imperfections, and to thinke that euery Nation, land, and Countrie, by the nature of the place, the climate of the heauen, and the influence of the starres hath certaine vertues, and certaine vices, which are proper, naturall, and perpetuall vnto it. And as good and sharpe wittes flourishe where the ayre is pure and subtill, so there are founde dull and grosse heads where the ayre is foggie and thicke. And touching conditions

you knowe that the Greekes though singular in learning and eloquence, yet are they disloyal and faythles, and there|fore it is prouerbially saide, The Greekish fayth. Moreouer, there are other people who by naturall vertue are giuen to the industrie and discipline of warre, and by natural vice are driuen to haughtinesse and drunkennesse, some are able ea|sily to sustaine and stoutly to beare out paine, watching and trauaile, who on the other side are vainglorious  braggers. To some, stout hardinesse, and deuout holinesse, haue ben al|wayes proper and natural, who neuerthelesse are world|lings and vnconstant. I am sure also you make no doubt of it, but that we Italians haue likewise some vices  vertues natural, and that we doe no lesse exceede in the one, then excell in the other. But if it seeme no maruaile vnto you to se these diuers fashions and customes, according to the diuersitie * and great distance of Countries, doe but consi|der howe much wee differ onely within the circuite of Italy, in the Romane, Tuscane, Lombardie, and other partes of it: then behold one of those partes apart, and cast your imagi|nation on the centre or point of Montferrat, and you shall finde, howe onely the riuer Po and Tanar make Countries to differ in language, apparell, life, and manners, which are no further distant one from another, then from one side or banke of the riuer to the other. Wherevppon you will graunt me, that all Countries haue their naturall faults to|gether with their vertues: wherby you may be assured, that if other people haue not vsed to play at cardes and dice o|penly, yet perchaunce they haue brought in vre both pub|likely and priuately vices farre more pernicious then this. Now to lose no more time about this point, I say vnto you, that it is not inconuenient, but necessary, to folow the diuer|sitie of manners and customes, according to the diuersitie of the Countries, * and to imitate Alcibiades, to whom it was counted a praise, that hee had so readie a wit to frame him|selfe to the diuersitie of the life and maners of other Coun|tries, * and according to the saying, When one is at Rome, to liue as they doe at Rome.



Guaz.
I shoulde thinke good that we shoulde nowe come to the generall points perteining to the conuersation of the tollerable.


Annib.
It is better in my mind to dispatch other things which now come in my head touching the intollerable. And though this matter be so ample, that a man cannot suffici|ently speake of it, yet we ought not with scilence to passe o|uer the vice of the slaunderous, who with the falsenesse of their tongues, seke to blemishe the brightnesse of others names.


Guaz.
That fault is at this day common throughout the worlde, and therefore we must spite of our teeth beare with ill tongues, which swarme in greater number then Bees doe in Iuly: neither is it possible for a man to escape their stinging, do the best he can. For now adaies men take such pleasure in this vice, that many which are fre almost from all other faults, yet are they not able to bridle their blasphemous tongues.


Annib.
* I haue by long experience noted, that com|monly the idle the ignorant, the vnfortunate, and banke|rupts, which haue no good successe in their own affaires, are they which seke to depraue the doinges of other men, and giue themselues to speake euill, for that they know not how to doe any thing well. * But though this fault be common to many, and grateful to the world, yet for al that it is hate|full to the worlde and whosoeuer shall looke througly into it, will graunt mee that the fault of him which speaketh yll of his neighbour, to the intent to bring him into hatred, is greater then of him who pulleth the bread out of the mouth of the poore. For as the soule is more precious then the bo|dy, so is it a greater offence to take away ones good name, which refresheth the soule, then to defraud one of food, which sustaineth the body.


Guaz.
It semeth to me that in these wordes is impli|ed some contrarietie, where you say, that to speake yll of others, is both gratefull to the worlde, and hatefull to the worlde.



Annib.
No truely, for our nature draweth vs to desire to vnderstand the imperfections of other, and wee count it the greatest pleasure that may be: and as we like well to heare others yll spoken of, so we cannot abide to be ill spo|ken of our selues, whether it be rightfully or wrongfully.


Guaz.
I count it nothing strange, that wee like not to be founde fault withall our selues: but what thinke you is the cause that we are so glad to heare others yll spoken of?


Annib.
I thinke that commeth to passe by meanes of two mightie enimies, which wee kepe in our owne house, that is, Ennie, and Ambition, which in our selues, conspiring against our selues, force vs to be greued that others shoulde bee counted good, and make vs desire that only we our selues may seme good. But I will tell you a thing which will make you maruell in dede and which you will thinke against all reason.


Guaz.
What is that I pray you?


Annib.
Mary that there are two principall sortes of these euill tongued: the one yll, which you ought to lie: the other farre worse, whose companie you ought not to auoide. I meane by Ill, those who without feare without shame; without any respect or difference, whet their tongues to rent a sunder, and impaire in all their talke both publike and priuate, the good name of others, sparing none, either present or absent. But these same, while they recount other mens faultes, doe many times more offende the mindes of the hearers, then those who doe commit them. And though they haue a marke on their forehead, and are knowne for infa|mous persons, yet for so much as they vtter their venome openly and flatly, they ought, in respect of the worser sort, ra|ther to be pitied then blamed: for that they shew plainely, that their euill speaking is deriued from their owne corrupt nature, not from the parties of whom they speake yll: By reason whereof, their wordes are not much credited, and in my opinion they doe nothing els but raise a dust to doe out

their owne eyes: for in accusing others, they condemne themselues, and where they woulde haue men thinke them to be Catoes, they shewe them selues Momes, Beastes, and not to be borne withall. But what shall wee say of those Curre dogges, which without barking bite vs priuily? who must be admitted into conuersation, notwithstanding they are farre worse then the other.


Guaz.
Which doe you take them to be?


Annib.
Those are of diuers sortes, who neuerthe|lesse shoote all at one marke. Some of them I call Mas|kers, some Rethoricians, some Poets, some Hypocrites, some Scorpions, some Traitours, some Forgers, some Bi|ters, some Mockers, and some vnknowne.


Guaz.
You make me laugh with your pleasant and strange distinctions: but whom call you maskers?


Annib.
There are certaine glorious fellowes, who at shrouetide goe with maskes on their face, and yet woulde faine be knowne what they are: so likewise certaine naugh|ty tongued fellowes vnder the maske of modestie, say they will not name him whom they reprehende, and yet they set him out so euidently, that all the hearers knowe whom he meaneth. By the example of the Countrieman, who tel|ling the hunter that the Fore was not gone that way, poin|ted notwithstanding to the place where he was hidden. Some of these maskers vse also speaches with a certaine outwarde shewe of commendation, which neuerthelesse are full of reproche and mockerie. And to say what is of it they are those who according to the Prouerb, Haue Hony in their mouth, and a knife in their hand.


Guaz.
Now who are the Rethoricians?


Annib.
They are those who with a certaine figure called by the Maisters of Eloquence Occupatio, make as though they would not speake euill,  yet doe it, and worse too. And touching this point, no longer agoe then yesterday I chaunced to be in companie, where one amongest the rest

complaining of another that had iniuryed him in words, saith, I will not rehearse the lewde part he plaied with a poore maide (whom hee named) neither the stripes hee cau|sed to bee giuen one night to another, neither the contractes of vsurie, which hee hath made with certaine poore men of such a place, which I perfectly knowe, but I will speake no|thing hereof, least men count me to be as ill tongued as he. Next after these, come y^e blasphemous Poets, who vsing the figure Antiphrasis, and speaking by contraries, will giue in mockage, the name of faire to a woman that is foule, and of honest, to one that is an harlot, and will commend the eyes of one which looketh a squint. Let vs nowe come to ill tongued Hypocrites, who vnder the colour of griefe  com|passion, to be the better beleued, lamentably rehearse the ill haps of other: which vice, though it be common to manie, yet it is most familiar with certaine women, who meting with other of their Gossips, after the first gretings, they foorthwith breake into thes speches, Haue you not hearde the hard hap of my vnfortunate neighbour: and therevpon making the storie, they rehearse howe the husbande by meanes of his seruant, tooke her tardie in her hastie busi|nesse. Then they tell the wall, and the way whereby her louer got downe: next, how cruelly her husbande beate her, and her maid,  thinke not that they leaue any thing behind vntolde, but rather will put too somewhat of their owne de|uise. After this, another beginneth to say, And I will quite your tale with the like chaunce that happened within this sixe dayes in our strete, but I pray you in any wise let it go no further. Now I leaue to you to thinke how in recounting these goodly nouels, they passe from one strete to another, to recite the doings of others.


Guaz.
The last yere y^e Dutches was driuen to part with one of her chief women, for this very cause: she had continu|ally her houres deuoutly in her hands,  was long time ta|ken for a woman of a most godly life, by reason whereof she was growen into great fauour with her highnes: notwith|standing in processe of time shee was detected to be one of a

naughty slanderous tongue: wherby she went about to bring into the disgrace of the Dutchesse al y^ Ladies of the Court. Before she fell to the matter, she vsed some suche insinuati|on, Madame I woulde not haue your grace any whit offen|ded or troubled for any thing that befalleth to your Gentle|women, for you ought to thinke that we are borne sinners, and that there is nothing in this world more fraile then our fleshe. Consider with your selfe, how much she inflamed the Dutchesse by these wordes, with desire to vnderstande the rest. And as she was earnest with her to goe on with her tale, the naughtie queane humbly requested her not to in|force her to speake of suche inconueniences. And after she had abidden thre or foure assaults, at length, as it were for|ced thereto, rubbing drie her eyes, which for very griefe stood full of teares, she began to make relation of the slipper prankes of the Dutchesses Gentlewomen, and had neuer done with her reprochfull reportes. But I expect now your spech of the yll tongued Scorpions.


Annib.
Those be they which will vtter these or suche like speches of you or any other: I thinke not possible to finde a more curteous and honorable Gentleman then Mai|ster Guazzo, whom I should farre more account of, if he had not one great fault. You knowe howe afterwarde he begin|neth in manner of a Scorpion to sting you with his tayle, in speaking yll of you. Others will handle the matter more artificially saying, A mischiefe take those yll tongues which cease not to molest those which are good and honest, and will not so much as spare the good name of our Maister Guazzo, of whom (notwithstanding hee is the flower of curtesie and vertue) yet they sticke not to say, that he is proude and ma|licious, and that corrupted with money he hath done  saide such and such thinges: and so tell all, and more too.


Guaz.
I vnderstand you. These same may goe hand in hand with those who alwayes accompany their (yea) with (but.) What say you now of yll tongued traytours?


Annib.
If perchaunce you haue receiued some hard in|treatment at your Princes hande, and * as it were to ease

your stomake * you make complaint therof to some one, vp|pon trust that you repose in him, and hee goe and discouer it to your Prince, wil you not iudge him to bee an ill tongued traytour, and one that seeketh your spoile?


Guaz.
Yes truly, and yet that fault is rise in Courts, and oftentimes Princes, being desirous to try out the truth, haue graunted their seruants the combate one against the other. And I knowe when vpon like occasion certaine Gen|tlemen haue conuayed themselues into some close place, where because the one would not liue with the name of an euil speaker,  the other of a false accuser, they haue made an ende of their liues and their quarrels both together.


Annib.
I comprehend also vnder this withered branch, all talebearers, and al spies, all coyners and sowers of dis|cord, and al those which bewray other mens secrets: leauing to your report how greatly they doe offend.


Guaz.
The least punishement that they deserue is, to haue their tongues pulled out, as Iupiter serued a certaine nymph, who bewrayed his secret loues to Iuno: but I mar|uaile nothing though many fal into this falt, for that we na|turally run vpon things which are forbidden vs. Whervpon a certain wise man vsed to say, that it was more easie to hold a burning coale, then a secret word in ones mouth. Where|fore I hold him for a very foole, which discouereth his secrets to another, if necessitie force him not. For according to the saying, He bringeth him selfe in subiection to another, which telleth his secret to him who knewe it not. I remember me to this purpose, of a pleasant part of a seruing man, to whom his maister gaue certaine garments: which he no sooner had, but he gaue them forthwith to a friend of his,  as his mai|ster blamed him for it, hee made answere, why woulde you haue mee kepe them, when you your selfe coulde not kepe them? A man may shape vs the like answere in reuealing our secretes, which we our selues could not kepe hidden in our hearts. And we ought to hold it for a ground, that things committed to the eares, are for y^e most part proclaimed in the

strets. But as it is a great falt to disclose y^e secrets of other: so contrariwise, it is a notable vertue to know how to holde ones peace, and to bridle his tongue. And if we be bounde to keepe close the secrets of a friend: how much more ought we secretaries to co~ceale the secrets of our maister, who giueth vs wages to the end we should be secret? and that we should imitate the Greke, who as one told him his mouth stunke, answered, that the cause of it was the many secrets which he suffred to mould and vinew within it. Which may be vn|derstood not only of other mens secretes, but of our own also. And in very dede he that will keepe his thoughts secret, let him not vnfolde them to any other, but let him be his owne secretary. But me thinkes I am strayed out of our way, and therefore it were better we returned to the distinction of the yll tongued.


Annib.
Naye rather, your briefe and sententious dis|course came well to the purpose, and I willingly gaue eare to it, as matter not proceding from a Secretary imployed in triffles. Let vs now speake of yll tongued forgers, whose naughtinesse is such, that they wil accuse you to haue done or saide that which you neuer thought. Wherein you often|times receiue iniury of two persons: to wit, of the false accu|ser, who according to the prouerb, speketh reprochful words to one that is deafe, which is, to backbite the absent:  of him who before he vnderstand the matter, giueth credit to those false surmises. This questionlesse is an ouer great fault, and in the number of these forgers I put those, who if you shall speake any thing vnto them soberly and sagely, make a false and peruerse interpretation of it, and wrest it to some euill meaning. The ill tongued byters follow next, out of whose mouth procede certaine short nips, which pearce our harts more then sharpe arrowes: And though they quippe  scoffe oftentimes according to the trueth, yet they are not cleare from gilt, for that they doe it with a spyteful mind: whereby they incur blame and ill will: Yea they are so indiscret and insolent, that they had rather forgoe a faythfull friende, then a scoffing speche. Neither can they so couer

their wordes vnder the cloake of pleasauntnesse or grauitie, but that their maliciousnesse is discyphered. But as they are blame worthie, who with such tauntes stir vp mens choler, so those are to be borne withall, who being prouoked, return one scoffe with an other: and those answeres euer are worth two of those which are made vnprouoked. Wherof we haue a thousande examples: amongst others, this is knowne to most men, which was made to the Emperour Augustus, who meting by chaunce with a straunger which resembled him verie much in fauour, asked him if his mother had at a|ny time bene at Rome, insinuating thereby in flouting ma|ner, that he might be his fathers bastarde sonne. But the straunger answered him no lesse boldly then merily, my mo|ther was neuer there, but my father hath.


Guaz.
It is verie true, that he which saieth what plea|seth him, heareth that which displeaseth him.


Annib.
After these same, come mockers and flouters, who without any comely grace, deride euery man, and more easily persuade them selues that they are pleasant and mery conceited fellowes, then perceiue them selues to be ignorant and vndiscrete fooles.


Guaz.
A Gentleman will hardly away withall, to be mocked by one of these glorious Asses, neither will he easily digest such an iniury.


Annib.
I thinke so, but he must vse patience, and folow the Philosopher, who as it was told him that certeine moc|ked him: answered, It may be they mocke at mee, but I am not mocked. * And no doubt he is greatly deceiued, which thinketh it lawfull for him to despise or mocke any, but those which are euil. There remaine nowe the euil tongued vn|knowne, who worke their feate two manner of wayes, ei|ther by writing, or by figure. The first, by slaunderous Ly|bels impaire the honour of others, and these same for the most part in maner of lightning, which scorcheth the toppes of Towers and high Palaces, cast foorth their renoume a|gainst Princes  great Lordes. The other, with tablets and pictures vse to represent men and women in some infamous

and dishonest act.


Guaz.
I remember that in a famous Citie there was by night set vpon the dore of his house, the most natural and resemblant picture of a Gentleman with two hornes on his forehead.


Annib.
Such dedes are blameable; yea, and deserue punishment rather then blame. * Now you haue heard how many sortes there are of the yll tongued in the world,  how grieuous their fault is: which is moreouer more shamefull when it is committed against the dead, for that the euil spea|ker sheweth thereby manifestly his base and abiect minde, in offending those who can not defende them selues, against whom while they were aliue, they durst not perchance once open their lippes. And of these, this saying rose, That the Lion being dead, the verie Hares triumph ouer him. * But it is nowe high time to set an ende to this discourse, and I feare mee you will counte mee yll tongued, to speake so muche yll of the yll tongued. Wherefore all these kinde of euil speakers gathered together, I say, that though they are had in hatred, yet commonly they are not exclu|ded from the company of others: for that they are not mar|ked on the forhead, by reason wherof we cannot refuse their company, but must away with them so well as we may.


Guaz.
Seing your minde is not, that we shall flie the Conuersation of such manner of pestiferous people, in my o|pinion it were expedient and necessarie, to teache some tricke howe we may be preserued from the venome of their ser|pentine tongues.


Annib.
Your request is very reasonable, whereto I briefly answere, saying vnto you, That like as certaine beastes, hauing to incounter with Serpentes, haue first re|course to certaine simples, which, being eaten, haue power to represse and mortifie their venome: so hauing often to in|counter with the euil tongued, we ought to be armed w^t some preseruatiue. And for my part, I finde no presenter remedie, when in our presence a foule mouthed railer fileth his toung to touch someone, then to abase our eyes, and not to seme to

take pleasure in his railing spech. For when he perceiueth we delight not in his words, he wil forbeare to speake euill. You know that arrowes will not sticke in stones, so neither wil their rotten roots stick fast, but where they find y^e ground soft  apt to receiue them. And I say thus much vnto you fur|ther, that if wee will seeke diligently which is the greater fault, either to giue eare to an euill speaker, or to speake yl of others, we shall confesse in the end, (as others haue done) that we are not able to giue any determinate iudgement of it. And to say the trueth, whosoeuer giueth hearing to a slaunderous detractor, giueth him occasion to offende: and it is so greate chaunce, but that hee him selfe is one of the same stampe. So that he which speaketh, thinketh he com|mitteth no fault, or at least if he doe, that he parteth it in the middle, giuing one halfe to the hearer, and taking the other vnto him selfe. Whereby it commeth to passe, that like two blinde men which leade one an other, they fall both into one ditch. Let vs then stoppe our eares, against the woordes of suche manner of people, and so dooing wee shall represse their vnbridled tongues, and get great ho|nour and credite with the wise. And as it is well done to beare no part in the yll report of others, so is it a dede de|seruing commendation, to make no account of the slaunders which others rayse of vs. And we ought to prepare our selues to haue our eares as readily at our commaunde, as they haue their tongues. By the example of Alexander the great, who making warre against an other King, and hea|ring one of his souldiers speake yll of him, rebuked him sharpely, saying, I giue the pay to fight against mine ene|my, not to rayle against him. The same Alexander vn|derstanding that some misreported him, went not about a|ny way to reuenge it, but answered sagely,  with a Prince|ly modestie, that it belonged to a King to doe well, and heare yll. * Ad hereto, the saying of Augustus, who hearing that Tiberius was verie sory that hee bare him self so modestly  patiently towardes those that spake yll of him, wrote vn|to him these woordes, Doe not (my Tiberius) here|in

followe your youthfull fansie, and take it in such skorne that there are some which speake ill of vs, for that is sufficient if we be in that case that none can doe vs harme Also he sayde to another touching this matter, that in a free itie men ought to haue free speeches.


Guaz.
But all princes haue not the corage of Alexan|der or Augustus.


Annib.
Truely if it be yll done to blemish the renoume of priuate persons, it is much woorse to misreport princes pecially our naturall and leige Lordes, and those which doe it are to be detested of all men, for that in speaking yll of them, they prouoke them to wrath, and oftentimes giue the~ occasion to alter their conditions, and of gentle and curte|ous, to become rough and cruell. Neyther can they excuse themselues by saying that there are naughtie princes and tyrantes, for so much as they haue receiued a commaunde|ment from God to obey their rulers, what soeuer they are in confirmation whereof it is sayde, if Nero be thy prince re|bell not against him.


Guaz.
Now that wee haue done with those pricking and thorny tongues, haue you any other sorte of persons which are at least to be borne withall and tollerated in our conuersation, though they be not to be desired?


Annib.
A certaine Philosopher, being asked what beast in the world he thought to be worst, answered, of wilde ones the euill tounged, of tame ones, the flatterer: and therefore I thinke we shall proceede in our discourses very orderly if hauing spoken alreadie of those wilde beastes wee, shall now intreate of these tame ones, whose breath is so veno|mous, y^t it poisoneth the hearts of those y^t giue eare vnto the~.


Guaz.
And in what row I pray you put you these?


Annib.
There are of them two sorts, the one open the other secret. The open flatterers are those, who constrained through nede and hunger, rather then any thing else, get them to the houses of great personages, and there playe their parte so wel that they make them beleue, according to the Prouerbe, that gloe Wormes are lanternes, and that the Moone is made of a grene Chese. Or at

least they wil be sure to say or doe some thing that shalbe ac|ceptable vnto them: And these get the name, not onely of slatterers, but also of Parasites and iesters. Like as one Nicesias, who seeing the flies bit as soone the handes, as soone the face of Alexander, sayd, O how much better are these flies then other, which haue the fauour to tast of your royall blood. * And another seing Dionisius (standing a good way of out of his hearing) to laugh with certaine of his famili|ers, he fel to laughing to: and as Dionisius asked him why he laughed: he answered, For that I know al your woordes to be so ful of wittie pleasantnesse, that they wil make any man laugh * You se likewise the comedies, both of the time past, and of the present, furnished with these flatterers and Gnathoes, whom for that they haue been pointed at, as they goe in the streetes, and openly noted for infamous persons, wee ought too auoide as intollerable, and men of vile condition, and of no valour, and who often like slaues are well and truely beaten for their scurrilous and broade iesting. And as the Ape which is not fit to garde the house as the mastiffe, neither to beare a burden as the Asse or horse, neither to eare the ground as the Oxe, giueth him|selfe to make vs laugh with his mops and mowes, and to indure a thousand villanies: so these flatterers, hauing no honest or profitable trade to commend themselues by, frame themselues to delight the eyes and eares of others, to their owne great shame and reproch. Next after these, followe the secret flatterers, who vnder the colour of friendship and good will, cunningly and artificially insinuate them selues into other mens fauour, and by their subtil deuises and false perswasions, make them fall into many errours.


Guaz.
You put these same as I thinke in the number of the tollerable.


Annib.
Iust.


Guaz.
And I would holde rather that they should be put in the number of the desirable,


Annib.
Why so?


Guaz.
For, that though all reprooe flatterie in woorde,

yet euerie one commendeth it in heart: and I promise you, that among so many cities, countries, and nations as I haue trauelled, I neuer yet found man so fierce and sauage which hath not suffered him selfe to be coyed and clawed with the tickling of flatterie: and by long experience, I haue noted that all persons of great valour, and of the best wits take a singuler pleasure no lesse to flatter others, then to be flatte|red them selues. You are not ignorant that if you, minding to extol me, cam and tolde me that I were a strong wrast|ler, or an excellent musition, I should thinke you mockt mee because no part of those partes are in me, but when you shal commend me for writing a fayre hand, or a pure stile, or for any thing else concerning my profession, I shall for manner and modestie sake make some curtesie to accept your com|mendation, but in my minde I shalbe well apaide of it: as well for that I perswade my selfe, that all which you shall say of me touching those matters, is most true, as for that naturally I am desirous of praise and commendation And I remember I haue read, that Themistocles beeing as|ked what woordes vttered on the stage, pleased him best, answered, those which recount my prayses. And this desire is common to al men, who are so licourous of honour * that onely to heare themselues exalted, maketh them besides the~ selues for ioy. Like as Demosthenes did, who passing before two waterbearers and hearing the~ say softly one to another this is y^e famous Orator Demosthenes, turned back,  stood a tiptoe to make himselfe the better seene, as who say, I am euen he. But what speake I of Demosthenes? How many are there * who without measuring their merit, or conside|ring whether they be praysed rightly or without cause, suf|fer themselues willingly to be deceiued, and take in good part these praises *. And on the contrarie how many doe we see (and perhaps I my selfe am one of them) that take it he|uily, and in a manner angerly, if they be not magnified * Yea I wil say more vnto you, that if one of these Gnatoes, of whom you haue made mention, should fall to commen|ding mee, and bend him selfe to set mee foorth in the best co|lours

he coulde, vndoubtedly I shoulde become a very Thraso, and I shoulde willingly listen vnto him, making my selfe beleue, that though he vsed to flatter others, yet he dealt plainly with me. Yea, I should can him thanke for it, and wishe that all my friends and kinsfolke were present to heare it.
Tush Maister Annib. Flatterie is the way to make friends, and winne preferment: and I am perswaded, that he which knoweth not howe to glose and flatter, knoweth not howe to behaue himselfe in companie. I hearde once a French Lorde say to his friends, flatter me, and ye doe me the greatest pleasure in the worlde. * And there is no man but knoweth, that as bitter reprehension is the beginning of enmitie, so gentle adulation is an entrie to amitie. * But if you thinke that flatterie doeth often make men do amisse, I am of the contrarie opinion: for as hee, which is worthilie commended, is thereby the more incouraged to goodnesse, so he that seth himselfe praysed without desert, acknowled|geth to himselfe his vnwoorthinesse,  indeuoureth by his dedes to become worthie of such praise. And if flatterie were a fault, discrete fathers and schoolemaisters would not vse it towards yong children, who notwithstanding they do not speake, reade, write, sing or daunce, or any such like, ex|actly and perfectly, yet their fathers or maisters cease not greatly to extol that which they doe, to the ende to incourage them to goe forward from good to better. You se also, that nature hath planted a certaine kinde of fawning flatterie, e|uen in the hearts of litle infants, who runne and imbrace,  kisse their parents and friends, when they woulde obtaine any thing at their hands: yea and hath taught it vnto beg|gers, who to haue our ames, importune and flatter vs with faire wordes, and pitiful speches. Moreouer, consider these sine Oratours what glauering speches they vse, and howe they teach men to insinuate,  by coloured wordes to crepe into mens boosomes, and to winne the fauour of Princes  Magistrates. Neither wil I omit the example of politike lo|uers, who to winne the good will of their beloued, terme her

both in talke and letters, sometime Mistresse, sometyme the heart of their life, sometime their soule, sometime their hope with such like flattering names. Yea, they will not sticke to sende her to Paradise, giuing her the tytle of a Goddesse, and calling her beautie Angelicall and diuine: her teth Perles, her lippes Corall, her hands Iuory, and as the Poet sayth,
Her heires are glistering Golde,
Her face the driuen snowe:
Her lids are of Hebene tree,
Her eyes two Starres doe showe.
The worlde (to make it short,) is full of flatterie, and is maintayned by flatterie, and at this day it is more in fashi|on then picked beardes, or great ruffes. You se howe all persons, to the intent to auoide contention, and to bee ac|ceptable in companie, sooth one an other, not onely by spea|king, but by holding their peace, and seming to consent to other mens sayings. In dedes likewise double diligence is often vsed, as, though we se the garmentes of our mai|ster or friend verie cleane without spot or mote, yet to picke vs a thanke, we will not sticke to rubbe and wype them with the lappe of our cloake, as if there were dust or durt vppon thm. Againe, there are some who whyle others speake, though they giue no care at all vnto them, yet they nodde their heads, and abase their eyes, and with signes seme to holde vpp their yeas and nayes, which is nothing else but mere flatterie. You know also that we natural|ly hate cauillers and Sophists, who at euery woorde wil o|uerthwart vs, and as they say, seke knottes in Bul|rushes: and howe on the other side those, which seme to con|sent to our sayings, eyther in wordes or iesture, we repute them for our friendes, wee beare them great affection, and loue to be in their company, taking their flatterie in stede of curtesie and good will. In so muche that we count him eyther enuious or proude, whiche doeth not sooth vs in all thinges: and so greate is our vaineglorie, that when men commende vs, though wee thinke it farre

aboue our desert, yet we attribute it rather to the great a|bundance of good will, then to the fraude of flatterie. You shall neuer heare any giue the lie to an other for prayses, which he shall wrongly and falsely slaunder him withall, but being puffed vp with pride and vainglorie, with a me|ry looke, he maketh answere, The good will, which you beare me, causeth you to say so. Therefore not without rea|son, a certaine Flatterer (being aduised to speake the truth) answered in ded, A man ought to speake the trueth to him that will heare it: but who is he? But neuerthelesse take this with you, that as trueth getteth hatred, so flatterie win|neth loue, and bredeth good blood, in so much that he, which should take flattery out of the worlde, shoulde take away al humanitie and curtesie, For then we should not salute him whom we take to be our enemy, wheras now we se, that he biddeth vs good morrowe with his mouth, which wisheth vs much sorowe in his heart. But what will you haue a man doe? * We must by their example giue them mery lookes, and fleer in their faces: we must play the Foxe with Foxes,  de|lude art, with art. * And as it is a fault stifly to stand in con|tention w^t ones friend, so is it a vertue to know how to giue place  yeld in giuing him the vpper hand. Like as the wyly Anichin did in Boccace, who suffering a Gentlewoman to mate him at chests, therby made him selfe her mate at better sport. * By these reasons therefore I conclude, that to winne fauour,  happily to atchiue our purposes, we must alwaies haue praysing and pleasing wordes in our mouth, * and we must count it commendable to extol both by woords  signes the dooinges of others, and to giue them tha which euerie one gapeth after.


Annib.
You haue very wittily commended  set foorth flattery, but for that I am altogether differe~t in opinion fro~ you, because I will not be thought a Flatterer, I wil oppose my self against the reasons which you haue alleged. And first I say vnto you, that men for the most part, are Flatterers of themselues, making themselues beleue they are that, which they are not. * With which folly Princes are oft times

blinded, like as Domitian was, who was neither afeard nor ashamed to cause him selfe to be called Lorde and God. Of whom a flatterer writeth these wordes to his glorie, but to his owne shame, The Edict of our Lorde and God. Like|wise Alexander suffering this madnesse to enter into his head, thought it not enough to be a man and a King, and to haue the title of great: but he would on Gods name, be called the sonne of Iupiter, neither was he wel pleased with those which did not sooth him in it. Whereof his mother complained, saying, He woulde bring her into disgrace with Iuno, for making her a Cucqueane. But at this diui|nitie a certaine Philosopher, who had no skill in flattering, made a scoffe, who seing his Phisition in his sicknesse pre|pare for the recouery of his health a certaine supping or broth, sayde, Our God hath put the hope of his health in a messe of broth: so that those whiche loue them selues, so without measure, * willingly giue eare to flatterers, of whom they thinke they are praysed, when in trueth they are but flattered. And therefore no meruayle though flat|terers are so acceptable. Yet notwithstanding, men of discretion, which knowe them selues and their desertes, though naturally they are desirous of prayse, yet they loue not to be flattered, or praysed without cause: for so much as false prayse is naught els but mockerie, and therefore I thinke you not so gredie of glorie, that if in the recitall of your prayses I should intermedle any thing which were not true, you would can me any great thanke for it, but would blame me either in woordes openly, or in your heart secretly.


Guaz.
Se howe you are wounded with your owne weapon, for in commending me for one who like not to be commended aboue my deseruing, you attribute a vertue vn|to me which is not in me, and shewe your selfe a flatterer, and a flouter.


Annib.
You are deceiued, and it is you your selfe that haue receiued the wounde: for hauing alreadie sayde, that if a flatterer prayse you, you will not take him for a flat|terer

towardes you, and nowe not allowing me to attribute vnto you a vertue, which you deme your selfe to haue, you are contrary to your selfe, and make me appeare a true dea|ler, and no flatterer. Besides that, when I say, I take you to be such a one that seketh not prayse without desert, this is no commendation, but rather a good opinion that I haue of you: This were a commendation, if I did affirme ab|solutely that you were suche a one as woulde giue no eare to flatterers. Wherefore my woordes hauing no signifi|cation of prayse, they can not receiue any interpretation or suspition of flatterie. Nowe following our purpose, I say againe, That a wise man doeth neuer agre to the false prayses of flatterers, who resemble altogether the Fishe Polypus: for as that Fishe chaungeth colour accor|ding to the obiect that it incountreth, so they alter their o|pinions according to the appetie of the hearers: and they are termed by an auncient Authour enemylike friendes, for vnder their pleasaunt sugred woordes, they kepe hid|den a bitter venomous meaning, * in like manner as the hooke is hidden vnder the bayte, or the Serpent a|mongest the flowers: Neither are they vnlike the But|cher who claweth the Hogge with his hande, to the in|tent to come conueniently to laye his Betle vppon his pate. Neither is it to be saide, that flatterie woorketh any good, for that a man commended without cause, inde|uoureth to deserue it: for a cunning flatterer, setteth the garmentes so artificially vppon the backe of him whom he disguiseth withall, that the seames shall not be sene: and betaketh him selfe in suche sorte to thinges like to be true, that he maketh them taken for true in dede. And albeit some famous writers haue intreated of the meanes to discerne a friend from a flatterer, yet is it in my opi|nion verie harde (that I may not say impossible) to attaine to that knowledge, as well for that the worlde is full of these tame beastes, as also for that it is harde to discerne the euill which resembleth the good. And therefore it was well sayde of a wise man, That as the Woolfe is like to

the Dogge, so is the flatterer to the friend: and that we must take hede to mistake, least thinking to set our selues in the keping of Dogges, we fall into the deuouring of Wolues. But be it so, that you fele the smell of false praise, yet notwithstanding you shall not fele in your selfe that re|morse and desire of deserte, which you speake of: for this false prayse hath a showe of trueth, and is bestowed vp|on you as due and deserued. I come nowe to the exam|ple of parentes, who as you say, flatter their children, to incourage them to vertue, and of children, who on the o|ther side flatter their parentes, to wring some thing from them: and I say vnto you, That these twoo cases differ. The first is not in trueth flatterie, for that there is no de|ceit in it.


Guaz.
Doe you not deceiue a childe, when he hath lept but a litle way, and you tell him he hath leapt excellent|ly wel?


Annib.
It is a good kinde of deceit which tendeth to a good ende, and which is profitable to the partie deceiued, as we Phisitions deceiue sometime our Patients, in giuing them the iuyce of Pomegranates in stede of wine.


Guaz.
Descend to the other example of children, which flatter their parentes to get money, or something els.


Annib.
That if I be not deceiued, requireth more depe consideration: and we must first vnderstande, that some to get fauour, vse to vphold and extoll whatsoeuer others shall say, without gainsaying any thing: some on the contrary, fall to contention continually, and crosse other mens say|inges, and these two extremes are naught, betwene which thereto lieth a way, which those kepe, who * will nei|ther altogether sooth, neither altogether thwart, but * in an honest sort knowe howe to allowe, or disallowe the sayinges of others in time and place, as it becommeth an honest man to doe. Next, we must note, that those who holde vp eue|rie ones yeas and nayes, only to the intent to delight, ought to be called iesters, but when they doe it for their aduaun|tage, they are without question flatterers. And according

to this distinction, children, which imbrace their parentes to get something from them, are to be termed flatterers: but in this case, we haue further to consider, that children can not giue prayse, or shewe loue to their parentes, that may surmount their naturall and bounden duetie, or that may be more then their parentes thinke they haue merited.


Guaz.
Yea mary, but it is a common saying, That he which maketh more of thee then he was woont, either hath coosoned the alreadie, or els goeth about to coosen the. And parentes are not so blinde, but that they se in this case the subtletie and craft of their children.


Annib.
They doe not only perceiue it, but also con|ceiue well of it, and doe not count it craft as you doe, but rather a thing commendable, for that they se their children therein to followe nature as their Mistresse, which tea|cheth vs to humble our selues in our nede, and to craue of others by dedes sounding foorth their prayse, and setting foorth our affection towardes them, and to know that he which wil haue, must aske, and he which wil enter into the house, must first knocke at the gate. And albeit we ought at all times to giue prayses to our heauenly father, yet we are most stirred theretoo, both with tongue and hearte, when we are desirous to obtaine any thing at his handes. And to appease his wrath, we call him not iust, but make mention of his clemency and mercy, whereof we stande in nede. Whereof, according to this consideration, we may rightly conclude, that suche manner of dedes ought not to runne vnder the name of flatterie, and that infantes, no nor children of discretion, can not (though they would) vse flat|terie towardes their parentes. Which Pittacus one of the seuen wise men of Greece plainely shewed, saying, Neuer be afeard to bee counted a flatterer of thy father. And tou|ching the example of the poore which begge almes with glauering woordes. I answere, that necessitie hath no lawe: and if to auoyde hunger, in some countries theft bee suffered, muche more ought flatterie to bee borne withall. And besides, I thinke that it is not pro|perly

to be called flatterie: for that a Flatterer doeth not vse openlye to shewe his nede, but cunningly la|boureth to mooue men to extende their liberalitie towardes him. And by the selfe same reason, I mainteine the cause of the Oratour, who craueth openly of the Prince or Iudge, that which hee desireth to obteine: neither ought hee any more to be blamed, then he which saith, take heede to thy selfe, for I meane to strike the. For as this same ma|nifesteth his intent, and giueth his aduersary leasure to pre|pare to defende himselfe: so the Oratour entreth not into the fielde, but that the iudge first knoweth the request hee is to make, and bethinketh him of the meanes which shall bee v|sed to sounde his opinion. There remaineth nowe no more but the last example of louers, who I am content to confesse vnto you, are in dede no better then flatterers. For a greater man then my selfe confesseth as much, writing, that if their beloued be flat nosed, they tearme her amiable: if hauked, they call her Princely: if she be browne, they count her manly: if white, heauenly. But this is not to be maruelled at, seing louers are both lawlesse, and witlesse, and that in their heartes as our Poet saith:
The senses beare the sway, and reason is subdued.
And as the louer flattereth his Mistresse, so she flattereth her selfe, for that there is no woman so deformed, who hea|ring herself called bewtiful, beleueth it not, or at least thin|keth not to be estemed for such of her louer. And as the Crowe to giue credite and consent to the prayses which the Foxe gaue him, let the pray fall foorth of his mouth: so many vnfortunate women haue felt the euill which commeth of flatterie, for that by the breath of prayses, as a Feather in the wind, they haue suffered themselues to be lifted so high, that being not able there to sustaine them selues, they haue falne to the grounde, and in the fall haue giuen their honor such a foyle, that of Mistresses, they haue become seruantes. Nowe touching that point of ciuilitie and curtesie, where you say wee salute those who are our enimies, I say that this sentence is most true; that we must not take for Doues

all that say Peace bee vnto you, but those ought to be ter|med dissemblers, rather then flatterers.


Guaz.
In my minde, you giue diuers names to one selfe thing, for so much as flatterie is neuer without faig|ning.


Annib.
There is as muche difference betwene those two, as betwene the generall and the speciall. For it is true that he which flattereth, faigneth: but not on the con|trary. And to explane it vnto you, beholde a fencer, who ma|king at his enimies head, striketh him on the legge, or some where els: you may well say that this fellowe dissembleth, but not that he flattereth. And valiant Captaines also, doe they not deceiue the enimie, when they make a shewe to goe one way, and then take another? and are not victories wonne as wel by Stratagemes and policies of warre, as by force of armes? which kinde of counterfeiting is not bla|meable, but rather commendable. And not only amongst enimies, but amongest friendes and acquaintance, coloura|ble dealing is tollerable, in thinges which are not preiudici|all vnto them. As if I be requested to goe se some Co|medy, or some Play, or some such like thing,  that I haue no minde to goe thither, I will make as though I were yll at ease: or if I would not be knowne by night, I will disguyse my selfe in some sort. You se then, that dissembling stret|cheth to many things, and to diuers endes, and that flattery is more strict, and conteined vnder dissimulacion, as the spe|ciall vnder his generall. Wherefore I conclude, that as it is not lawefull to dissemble in flattering, for that it is not hurtfull to him towardes whom it is vsed, so is it per|mitted (neither can it be saide to be a faulte) to dissemble without harme,  without intent to hurt another. I graunt well, that hee which maketh a shewe to loue one, to the in|tent to deceiue him, or do him wrong, is much too blame, and that the Philosopher counteth him worse then a forger of monie, for that there can be no friendship, where there is counterfeiting. But if for ciuilitie and good manner sake, I salute one whom I am acquainted withall, without

shewing any affection towardes him, I ought not therefore to be called a dissembler for that I am mooued to do him ho|nour, rather in way of curtesie, then of good wil. Besides, you knowe that the worlde is full of naughtie men, whom we iustly hate for their imperfections: but it is not good to giue them to vnderstande what yll will we beare them. And bethinke your selfe herein, that many are beloued which are not honoured, as children, who are loued, not ho|noured of their parents: and contrariwise many are hono|red, which are not loued, as some Princes, not well liked of their subiects, or some Magistrates, which are honoured, but not loued of the people: And therefore we cannot often|times; nor ought not to faile in ciuilitie and curtesie, in re|spect only of our owne duetie. For we are bound to * re|salute those which salute vs, be they our inferiours or e|quals: If they be princes or magistrates, or our superiours, we ought to doe them honour for the reuerence due to their estate, if not for affection. I thinke I haue sufficiently she|wed the difference betwene faining, and flattering. Now I say againe, returning to flatterers, that they are men of most vile and naughtie nature. And though it be a harde mat|ter, as we haue saide already, to discerne a friende from a flatterer, yet we must note, that commonly the greater are flattered by the lesser, and the more they are in prosperitie, the more they are beset with flattterers: who alwaies make their repaire thither where profite is to be reaped. Where|of it commeth that Princes are euer besieged by these euill spirites: wherevpon Carneades vsed to say, that Princes sonnes neuer learne to doe any thing well, but only to ryde, for that their gouernours and teachers seke to please them, and make them beleue they are sufficiently sene in thinges whereof they haue no skill at all, which happeneth not in ryding their horses, for the horse, which is no flatterer, and which maketh no more accou~t of the great then of the smal. throweth them to the ground, if they cannot sitte fast in the sadle. And therfore we must beware of such persons, both for y^t they are hurtful to vs,  because god is displeased with the~.

And I am in doubt whether be the greater offence of him that slaunderously reproueth the good, or of him that flatte|ringly commendeth the euill. I remember I haue lear|ned long since, that God is greuously offended to heare one either like to himself discommended, or vnlike, commended:  no doubt, but it is a great fault, through flatterie to com|mende for one thing, for which he ought of right to be re|proued: which is signified vnto vs by the sentence. Woe bee vnto you which call the euill good: These flatterers are resembled to those which put a pillow vnder our heads, and delicate  soft Feathers vnder our bodies to make vs slepe. Likewise those are in great fault which flatter of purpose to hurt, like as Iudas did. And therefore it is written, That it is better to be beaten of ones friende, then kissed of his eni|nimie, to wit, a flatterer: and for the conclusion, to com|mende that in one which is euill, is the dede of a deceiuer, and a very kinde of treason. * And therefore the Empe|rour Sigismund is worthie commendation, who hearing a certaine shamelesse fellowe call him God, vp with his fist, and gaue him a boxe on the eare, and when he saide, why doest thou strike me Emperour? He answered, why doest thou bite mee flatterer? *


Guaz.
For somuch as you haue plainely shewed vnto me howe hatefull and hurtful these flatterers are, I thinke good they were scored vp amongst the Intollerable.


* Annib.
Nay, let vs set them euen cheke by cheke by the euill tongued, vpon the seate of the tollerable: and taking both of the~ as friendes, let vs take hed of them as enimies: and put vpon our head a Helmet to defende our eares from their perillous speches, reme~bring that he which willingly listeneth to flatterers, is like to the sheepe y^t giueth the woolf suck: or to him which leadeth by the hand another, who set|teth his foote before him to giue him a fall. And whe~ you per|ceiue these glosing merchants to prayse you, and extoll you to the skies, desire them of curtesie to let you remaine on earth, saying vnto them, that if you stand in nede of praise, you will praise your selfe: or els doe as a certaine Gentle|man

my friende did, who hauing a greate while, and with great patience giuen eare, to a flatterer which had commen|ded him aboue the Moone, saide vnto him in the end, I know not what to doe with these praises, for if I reiect them, I shal accuse you of flatterie,  if I accept them, I shall shewe my selfe desirous of vaine glory: therefore like good fellowes let vs part them, giue me the one halfe, take the other to your selfe.


Guaz.
But in discretion the Gentleman ought not to haue taken halfe, but to haue forsaken all.


Annib.
Nay by your leaue, he shewed great discretion in it, for flattery beeing alwayes mixed with some parte of trueth, he was wise to accept the trueth, and leaue the lyes to the flatterer.


* Guaz.
I like your opinion well touching the repulse we ought to giue to suche counterfaite praises, but in this point there commeth to my minde a doubt, if I, mooued by the good wil I beare you, and hauing fit occasion ministred, giue vnto you in your presence true and due praise, which you haue worthily deserued for some dede of yours, whe|ther it shalbee your part to reiect it, or passe it ouer with si|lence.


Annib.
For that silence woulde be a signe of disdain|fulnesse or lightnesse. I either with Christian humilitie would answere you, in referring those praises to God as oc|casion of all good, or else with a Morall modestie, I woulde seke somewhat to extenuate my glory,  make you or some other partaker of those praises. In like manner, as Pyrrhus that great Captaine did, who beeing returned from warre with spedy and prosperous victorie, and hearing his souldi|ers call him a couragious eagle: answered, If I be an eagle, you are the cause of it, for that with your armes and wea|pons as it were with feathers you haue vpholden and sustei|ned me. * But it is time to goe out of the conuersation of flatterers, and to conclude, that he is happy, which neither flattereth other, nor suffereth himselfe to be flattered by o|thers: which deceiueth not, nor is deceiued: whiche neither

doeth yll, nor suffereth yll to be done to him.


Guaz.
For so much as the friend, and the flatterer haue so great conformitie together, that hardly one can be knowne from the other, I woulde gladly haue you instruct me howe I ought to behaue my selfe not to be reputed a flatterer.


Annib.
You must obserue therein two things: the one, neuer to praise a man in his presence, a fault that fewe can take hede of, not reme~bring the saying of the Greke Poet: Hee which speaketh ill of mee behinde my backe, doeth mee no wrong, hee which speaketh well of me before my face, reprocheth mee. But for that there are some whiche will thinke you ey|ther proude or enuious, if you praise them not, the other thing to be obserued, you must take with them another course, which is, to imitate the dogge of Aegypt, which drin|keth at the riuer of Nyle, and then runneth his way: so you must seme to acknowledge their deserts,  that you wil not vtter their praises in their presence, for feare to bee thought to flatter them, leauing neuerthelesse this little Suger in their mouth.


Guaz.
Haue you any other persons of the ranke of the tollerable, which are neither to be desired nor auoyded.


Annib.
I haue saide vnto you alredy, that to the vice of flatterie, gainesaying is opposed, and therefore I thinke good we speake of these contentious fellowes, whiche obsti|nately withstand the opinions of other, and wil neuer leaue till they haue the last woorde, not waying the dislyking or displeasure of others.


Guaz.
Albeit I cannot abide the qualities and compa|ny of such manner of men, yet I remember I haue hearde a vertuous and noble Gentleman to make good account of them, saying, That those are indued with excellent wittes, which can maintayne their priuate opinions against the common opinion of all: and that we hearken vnto them with more attention and admiration. And in good sooth, if you shoulde with a long discourse prooue vnto me that the Sunne is clere and hot, you woulde make me haue no

great lyst to listen vnto you, for that you shoulde tell me no|thing, but that which I knowe before: but if you will make good that it is obscure and colde, O howe you woulde stirre vp my spirites, and make me attentiue to heare you. It was therefore, that a certaine Philosopher hearing that there was one preparing himselfe to make a speache, in the praise of Hercules, answered, Why? who discommendeth him? Beholde on the contrarie, with howe great pleasure and admiration we reade the Paradoxes of diuers wittie and learned writers, specially the pleasant pamphlets made in praise of the plague, and of the French poxe. And if you replie, that this belongeth rather to a fantasticall Poet, then to a graue authour, I woulde haue you consider, in what estimation the Philosopher Fauorine is, onely for the fame hee hath woone, for extolling, with many and sin|guler praises, the quarterne Ague: which notwithstanding the Frenchmen wishe to their enimies, as the greatest euill which may befall them. And therfore I am of opinion, that in things of most difficultie, consisteth most excellencie and admiration. And I se you Philosophers dispute and ar|gue one against another, and holde singuler opinions farre from the trueth: so that the Gentleman of whom I spake euen now, would place these men rather amongst the desi|rable, then the tollerable.


Annib.
I thinke good that whom you haue nowe na|med, should be put in the rowe of the desirable and com|mendable, which deserue not the name of contentious: for though they swarue from the trueth, yet they haue some shew of reason in their talke, and besides, they do not thinke what they say, doing it to no other ende, but to shewe their sharpe and good wit, not that they haue conceiued any such opinion in themselues so that it were great folly to thinke that Fauorine was desirous to haue the quarterne Ague, and those other writers the Plague. But those whom I call contentious and ouerthwarters, are for the most parte grosse headed fellowes: and it is an olde saying,

that the vice of contradiction is proper to men of small dis|cretion: who oppugne the trueth, either of ignorance, or of obstinacie: and they are like to Heretikes, who being con|uicted by inuincible reasons, yet will yelde nothing at all, but reply still to the contrarie. Moreouer, these contenti|ous companions loue to be doeing with euerie one, and yet still goe by the worse: and when they are able to mainteine Argument no longer by any reason, they enter into a chafe, and seke to get the vpper hande by outcries, swearing, threatning, and arrogant demeanour. And some time it hap|peneth that they mete with men of like nature, whereby euen for very trifles they fall to dyre debate and strife. Tou|ching that you alledge afterwardes of Philosophers, I an|swers you, that it is not only laweful and mete for them to dispute, but also for all other men, when they enter into rea|soning amongest themselues, and are of contrary opinions: and he deserueth greatest praise, which defendeth the hardest part, and though they disagre in wordes, yet they disagre not in loue and mutuall goodwill, but seke with one accord the trueth: not vnlyke to those which make Cordes, who though they winde and twist one contrarie to the other, yet they thereby accomplishe the worke they take in hande. But yet disputations haue their boundes and limites prescribed, which it is not lawful to passe without loosing the name of a Disputer,  getting the title of contentious caueling Sophi|sters, who many times thereby come to mischiefe, and by be|ing too earnest in contrarying, haue ben distraught of their right vnderstanding. And as things, by making them too thinne and fine, are soone broken, so by too much contention, the trueth is made intricate and doubtfull. And therefore those are to be called contencious, who not of purpose to dispute or exercise their wit, but of a contemptuous arro|gancie, hold argumentes not only repugnant to the trueth, but altogether dissonant from reason.


Guaz.
What doe you take to be the occasion of this fault?


Annib.
Marry a mother with her two children, to wit,

ignorance with selfe loue, and vaine perswasion: whereof it commeth, that those which knowe nothing, thinke they know all thinges, and holde their ignorance for wisedome.


Guaz.
In dede the first Chapter of fooles, is to esteme themselues wise.


Annib.
You knowe it is the easiest thing in the worlde, for a man to deceiue himselfe: but the wise man ad|monisheth vs, not to be wise in our owne conceite, for that such wisedome is called diuelish: and verily he which kno|weth most, taketh vpon him least, and yeldeth to reason. And therefore no maruell though the ignoraunt people bee full of contention. Wee will then conclude, that to reason without reason, is to take paines to make himselfe euyll thought of, and that these caueling quarellous merchantes are greatly to be blamed, notwithstanding we must be faine to beare with them.


Guaz.
As you haue shewed the way howe we may defend our selues against slaunderers  flatterers, so I wold haue you shew your mind how we should behaue ourselues with these ouerthwart persons.


Annib.
When you perceiue your selfe to preuaile no|thing by reasoning with your friende,  that there is doubt of some disorder, you ought rather to bowe then to breake, feding his humour, if it be not in such a case as silence may brede greater offence. For when a man forsaketh reason, and suffereth himselfe to be ouercome with anger, it is our parts wisely to beare with his imperfection, according to the Prouerbe, Cut not the fire with the yron: and we must per|mit sometimes prudencie, to giue place to timeritie.


Guaz.
I knowe a Gentleman, who if he chaunce to fall in companie with one of these obstinate fellowes, rather then he will stande in contention with him, vseth to say: Sir we will neuer striue about the matter, I am content it shalbe as you say. And as one of them asked him, whiche eye of the right, or of the left, was able to discern a thing fur|thest: to take from him all occasion of contention, he answe|red foorthwith, which it shall please you.



Annib.
Such answeres, if they be made in gentle ma|ner, without scoffing, they are very conuenient, and they are of force to make the obstinate acknoweledge his fault.


Guaz.
Doe you not thinke we haue spoken enough of these manner of men?


Annib.
I thinke we may couple with these, some o|ther troublesome fellowes, who offend, not by ignorance, but sharpen their wittes onely to prouoke others, who vp|on euery worde will make a Comentarie, and lye in waite to take others in a trippe in that they shall say: This fault is peculiar to certaine schoolemaisters, and other professours of learning, who will oft times shape very newe founde an|sweres, and nowe and then propose such doubtfull doubtes, that are enough to make a dogge runne a myle without loo|king behinde him. But sometime they mete with mates that dresse them in their kinde, and yelde them the honour which is due vnto them. Like as a poore craftie clowne ser|ued his sonne, who about euery worde, woulde be arguing with him, for hauing one day nothing but foure egges vpon the table for their dinner. The young gentleman (forsooth) to shewe his wit, would nedes vndertake to prooue that there were vii. for that the iii. is contained in the number of foure, and iiij. and iij. make vij. The father, to auoyd strife, tooke the iiij. egges, saying: I wil eate these,  take you y^e other iij.


Guaz.
What resteth now to be spoken of?


Annib.
We haue now to speake of lyers, who swarue from the trueth, for another purpose, and in other sort then the contentious doe. And first and formost, lyars are flatte|rers, dissemblers, boasters,  vaine glorious, neuer ceassing to set foorth their owne praises, enterlacing lyes amongest them: a fault though not great, yet which greatly misliketh vs. For there is nothing spites vs more, then to heare a man commend himselfe.


Guaz.
Those are tearmed houshold witnesses, who per|haps praise themselues, for lacke of good neighbours.


Annib.
They should do better to spend that time, which they imploy in praising, or (to say more truely) in blaming

themselues, in getting, by their commendable dedes, true praise, which onely procedeth from praise worthie persons. But they are so farre in loue with themselues, that they are nothing set by of others: forgetting the saying, That he which washeth his mouth with his owne praise, soyleth himselfe with the suddes that come of it: and, that praise in a mans owne mouth, is spilt. But as the fault of these vaine speakers is light, when it hurteth no body, so it is greuous and haynous, when it is preiudiciall to others. And a|mongst many examples which might be alleaged, the wic|kednesse of those is not to be concealed, which make boast of their worthie conquestes in loue matters, bewraying the frailenesse of some women, to whom they haue promised se|cresie by a thousand false othes.

Which afterwardes the windes, disperse amid the ayre



Guaz.
The othes of louers, carry as much credite as the vowes of Mariners. But what think you of others, who falsly make their vaunt to haue had the vse of that woman, to whom they neuer in their liues spake worde: and seke to spot her with reproch, in such sort, as in old time false the ac|cuserers of innocent Susanna did.


Annib.
Those which blowe foorth such blastes, deserue to haue their winde stopt with a halter: and those deserue litle lesse, which wil lightly beleue such lewde tales, and re|port the~ again, in such sort, that in short space a most honest woman shalbe most wro~gfully take~ of the people for a com|mon harlot, I leaue it vnto you to thinke what a harts grief it is to her to be so vniustly slaundered. Let vs therfore con|clude, that all lyes, which turne to the hurt or dishonour of others, are diuelish and detestable.


Guaz.
I cannot for my part away with the company of those other lyars, which at no time tell trueth, though it turne not to the hurt of any.


Annib.
You haue reason, for as he, which plainly telleth the trueth, sheweth himself to be an honest man,  of noble con|dition: so he which lieth, doth the act of a slaue,  of a disloyal, vniust,  vndiscrete person. * And therfore wise men ought

to print in their heart the saying of Pithagoras, who being demaunded when men did any thing which might make them like to God: answered, when they tell the trueth. * And if you marke well the nature of lyers, you shall finde them to be impudent, and without shame, and therefore well saide the Philosopher, That iustice resembled a pure virgin, for that the puritie therof is spotted by leasings. And though lying be vnsemely for euery man, yet is it more tol|lerable in one of base calling, and who is driuen thereto of necessitie: And therefore in holy Scripture, a riche man be|ing a lyar is greatly reproued.


Guaz.
There are diuers which thinke to get the name of pleasant conceited fellowes, by telling some monstrous strange tale, to make the hearers merie, or cause them to maruell, and craue the Poets priuiledge, to vse the figure Hyperbole at their pleasure. Like as he, which tolde that going a hunting, he found a Boore so olde, that he was be|come starke blinde, and that another young Boore for very compassion, put his taile into the olde ones mouth,  so lead him out to fede: Now he shooting at them, cut of the young Boores taile, which hung still in the old Boores mouth, and running quickly, tooke the taile in his hand, and brought the poore Boore by a long way euen vnto the Citie, thinking stil that his fellowe had lead him.


Annib.
I thinke it troubled him more to tell this tale, then to leade the Boore?


Guaz.
These felowes perswade themselues so earnest|ly to beleue a lye, that they woulde haue you beleeue it too, and if you doe not, they thinke you misuse them.


Annib.
It is well doone not to beleue them, but they do vs wrong to force vs to beleue that which is false, which is nothing els but to giue vs a gudgin, and floute vs like cre|dulous fooles, but in the end they doe penance for their fault, for being once knowne for cogging and lying mates, they are neuer after credited, though they tell the trueth, which this saying sheweth.


The Liar neuer is beleeued, although an oth he take,
the honest euer is beleeued, although a lye he make.

I denie not, but that it is commendable to coyne a lye at sometime, and in some place, so that it tend to some honest ende.


Guaz.
There commeth to my mind, touching these kindes of lyes, a pleasant example, happened in the Court, where I knewe a Princes sonne, being about twelue yeres old, who in behauiour and good conditions surpassed al other his equals in the Court, but he had one childishe fault, which neither by admonishing, neither by reprehending, nei|ther by threatning, he coulde be made to leaue. Which was this, He woulde through negligence suffer his nose alwaies to be sneueled,  tooke no care to wype it: while his gouerner tooke paines to amend this fault, there co~meth on a time to this child, to craue his deuotio~, a poore old man, whose nose by some infirmitie was become meruellous great, deformed, ful of pimples, precious,  monstrous: the childe with a certain feare mixed with compassion, was much mooued at it, wher|vpon his discrete gouernour began to say vnto him, that he had knowne that poore man a long time, and remembred he had sene him in his youth with a little nose, well fashioned and sound, but that afterwarde the sneuil and filth for want of wyping and making it cleane had brought it into that case. The childe was put into such a feare by these words, that hee began foorthwith to spit, and to blowe and wype his nose in such sort, that he neuer after neded to bee put in minde of it. And therefore this lye was profitable to the Prince, and commendable for the gouernour.


Annib.
It is very true: and as suche lyars are to be praised, so the other are to be blamed, and to be registred amongest those which are neither to be desired nor auoided. Besides, there are certain curious felowes to be discommen|ded, which trouble euerie one in vsing alwaies this worde Wherfore, being desirous to enter too farre into other mens matters, which is perchaunce a fault greater then it is ta|ken

for: for there is neuer any curious person, but he is like|wise malicious, and besides, ouer talkatiue, playing the tale bearer from one to another, and therefore the Poet blameth him which is inquisitiue of that he hath nothing to doe withall.


Guaz.
As I remember I haue read of one, who carying a present vnder his cloke, and being asked what he caryed there: answered, Doe you not se howe it is of pur|pose couered, for feare least you shoulde knowe it?


Annib.
I remember I haue read the same, and ano|ther like thing of king Antigonus, who passing by his armie, entered the Tent of Antagoras the Poet, and hauing founde him seethyng certaine fihes, saide vnto him: Doe you thinke that Homer medled with the sething of fishes while he wrote the dedes of Agamemnon? To whom the Poet answered, Thinke you that Agamemnon, buzied a|bout the execution of his enterprises, was curious to knowe whether there were any sodde fishe in his Campe? But if curiositie be blameable in worldly affaires, it is detestable in matters of religion: and therefore we are admonished not to seke to knowe thinges which belong not to vs to knowe. Nowe as the curious are neither to be desired nor auoyded, so ought we to account of the ambitions.


Guaz.
Your opinion is then, as farre as I se, that am|bition bringeth foorth euill effectes?


Annib.
Why, who knoweth not that.


Guaz.
Mary, I for my part se not howe it worketh other then good: for that it wakeneth drowsie spirites, dri|ueth away slouthfulnesse, and fearefulnesse, styrreth vp the minde to the vnderstanding of commendable thinges, and to the executing of couragious enterprises, and heaueth those that followe it, to the high degre of dignitie and ho|nour.


Annib
So long as a man passeth not those bounds, he ought not to be tearmed ambitious, but couragious, for so much as these same are works commendable, and vertues:

but that can not be saide of those which procede naturally of ambition, which altogether bereaueth them of rest, which set no staye to their restlesse desires: which filleth them full of pensiue care, blindeth their vnderstanding, rayseth them aloft, to the intent to throw them downe headlong, to breake their neckes, and bring them to destruction. And there|vpon it is saide, that Lucifer through pride and ambition fell from heauen, desiring rather to commaunde, then o|bey. And it is saide by an other, That ambition is the crosse and torment of the ambitious. And therefore when I saide that ambition is the cause of many abuses, I ment not those men, which knowing their owne valour, aspire to high enterprises and honours, which by the instinct of na|ture we all couet: for that honour is the rewarde of ver|tue, and counted a diuine thing. But my meaning is of the ambitious, who without taking any paine, without doing any thing mete for a noble minde, and without any foundation of deserte, seke in companie to goe before o|thers, and to be placed aboue others.


Guaz.
Those in trueth are to be detested, and I know some of them, who * at the entring in at the dore, or at the sit|ting downe at the table, make hast to set their foote before others, and are verie sorie when others vsurpe ouer them that foolishe preeminence: not knowing that the place nei|ther giueth nor taketh away vertue.


Annib.
Those which doe so, perceiue them selues litle accounted of, and perchaunce knowe verie well that no bo|die will say vnto them, I pray you sir, goe before. But it is great glorie, and a signe of great desert, when that honour is done to one without striuing for it, and it is most certaine, that he which setting aside all ambition, humbleth him selfe beneath others, is of best estimation, and of best education. But women fall chiefely into this vanitie, and herevpon there often ariseth amongest them the best sport in the worlds, for none of them being willing to giue place, and euerie one of them being ready to take place, they

occupie the way and the vpper roomes as it were by force: and withall, you shal often heare amongst them one say, my husband is a Doctour, an other, mine is a Gentleman, an o|ther, I am descended from the Troyans, an other maketh vaunt of her dowry and her iewels, wherwith shee boasteth her selfe to be able to buy the other out of house and home, in such sorte, that if the husbandes fall to deale in these quar|relles, they will neuer be decided or determined without blowes.


Guaz.
And what thinke you of the ambition of those men who are neuer mery, nor in any countenance, but when they haue a great traine of seruing men at their tayle: and if they chaunce to want them, suche is their folly, (their fansie I shoulde say) that they will not stirre foorth of their doores.


Annib.
That kinde of ambition is common to Asses, who in like case will not goe before, if they haue none to fol|lowe them. Of the number of the ambitious, are the haugh|tie and proude, whose company is wonderfull hatefull, and contrarie to our nature, whereto humanitie and curtesie is most agreeable. And in my fansie, such people may be resembled to tyrantes, which care not though they be hated, so that they may be feared. And therefore this sort of per|sons neuer loue to humble them selues, fearing that if they shoulde shewe them selues good fellowes, and become mates for euerie man, they should growe into contempt, so that their reputation thereby might be diminished. But though these fellowes take bigly vpon them, and are puft vp with pride, yet assure your selfe, that their heartes are filled full rather with winde then worthinesse.


Guaz.
O howe these glorious fellowes are hated of the Frenchmen. Which belike is the cause that they can not brooke the Spaniardes, who are counted verie proude and loftie, especially of those who are not thorowly acquainted with them. Which I speake, for that I haue been in com|pany with some of the~, who in shew haue semed very loftie,

and yet in dede haue been verie lowly.


Annib.
It may be, that the Spaniardes likewise will not like of the Frenchmen, for their easie acquaintance and sodaine familiaritie. And in my opinion, betwene these two extremities, our nation kepeth the meane, where you shall commonly se ioyned together, a graue kinde of curtesie, and a curteous kinde of grauitie, but those whom I terme proud and high minded, offende both in shewe and in their doings, and they stand alwayes vpon their Pantofles, despising eue|rie one, and desiring to bee honoured of euerie one. Neither must we looke to liue familiarly with them, but humbly to doe honour vnto them, and to offer vp incense vnto them, as it were to the halowed Alters: so y^t it is no meruayle if they be odious to all men. Which kinde of men, a pleasant writer scoffing at, sayeth, That that meate is vnpleasant in taste, which smelleth of the smoake. But what say I, odious to men, seing God him selfe hath them in hate, who withstan|deth the proude, and sheweth mercy to the meke  humble in heart.


Guaz.
It may be well saide of suche men, that which the Poet writeth.

He falles most lowe, who seekes to climbe most high.



Annib.
Our discourse would be too long,  perchaunce superfluous, if we should search out one after an other, all which are spotted with this fault, and intreate of the nature and qualitie of them: And therefore I thinke good, that we set an end to our discourse in this point.


Guaz.
There is somewhat yet that stickes in my sto|make, for your minde is, that wee should flie only the infa|mous, and those which are notoriously naught, and tollerate the yll, which we haue heere made mention of: by meanes whereof, in my opinion, you slacke the bridle too much to this Conuersation.


Annib.
I might well answere you, according to the rules of the Ciuilians, that wee ought to restraine thinges which are euill, and set at large thinges commendable, in which number we presuppose Conuersation to be: but I say

vnto you, that according as I haue handled the matter, it is rather restrained then otherwise. For though I haue per|mitted you to tollerate, to wit, neither to seke, neither to shun the aboue named, who are numberlesse, yet I gaue you not libertie to seke or craue the companie of other then the good, who are but fewe. And whosoeuer shall obserue that order, well he may accompany with many by chaunce, but with fewe by choyce. And your selfe, though by reason of your affaires or other accident, you shall haue to deale with diuers persons, yet you will like much better,  desire more willingly, the companie of one or two, to whom you shall be affectioned for the good partes you knowe to bee in them. Whereby I conclude, that the companie which we come into by chaunce, consisteth of many persons, but that which is voluntarie, which we ought to couet, containeth but fewe folke in it.


Guaz.
For one doubt which you cleare me of, not vn|like the Hyders head, there arise seuen in that place, and ac|cording to that saying,
At euerie step, in steppeth a newe thought.
Nowe tell mee a little, if a Harlot or a Baude, or some such defamed person, shall come in the open strete, or in some other publike place, to talke with me, will you that without suffering him to mete me, I runne away from him, as if he were excommunicated, or had the plague.


Annib.
It were not mete for you, who are a priuate person, to giue eare vnto his woordes, but for a Magistrate it were not amisse.


Guaz.
Then he which giueth eare vnto him, doth not flie from him, which is repugnant to your first order. And he which flieth not from him, beareth him selfe indifferent|ly towardes the intollerable, and the tollerable: which is likewise contrarie to your distinction.


Annib.
If a Harlot, Ruffian, or other infamous person, shoulde goe to the Duke your maister, to craue iu|stice, or put vp some other honest request, woulde hee driue

him out of his presence?


Guaz.
No.


Annib.
If he came before him, to talke familiarly with him, would he sende him packing out of his sight?


Guaz.
There is no doubt of it.


Annib.
By this diuersitie then you may knowe, that the intollerable is sometimes tollerable, not in re|spect of him selfe, but of the occasion which bringeth him into companie.


Guaz.
I vnderstand you, but yet there arise other doubtes, for so much as amongest these tollerable, which we haue named, there is founde greate difference in their imperfections. For the faule of a vaineglorious boaster, or a contentious ouerthwarter, is farre lesse then that of a pernicious flatterer, or a malicious sclaun|derer: and yet you put them all in one predicament. Besides, I thinke it impossible, that he shoulde encline rather to good then to euill, who hath one of these faultes. For that one of these is of force, to obscure and deface all the good partes whiche shall be in him. And there|fore in my opinion they are to be put in the number of the intollerable.


Annib.
We haue alreadie concluded, if you remember it, that we ought to admit into our com|panie all those whiche are not marked in the fare, and whiche are not commonly holden for defamed, nor excluded out of good and honest companie, notwithstanding they be sprinckled with some imperfection.
But to satisfie you, let mee aske you if you knewe, in the courte of Fraunce, men of diuerse natios, as I re|member you haue alreadie sayde?


Guaz.
I knowe there besides Frenchmen, Spa|niardes, Englishmen, Fleminges, Almanes, Scottes, and Italians.


Annib.
With w^t of al these were you most often,  most

willingly conuersant.


Guaz.
You may well thinke, that by my will I al|wayes got my selfe into the companie of Italians.


Annib.
But which Italians?


Guaz.
The Lombardes.


Annib.
And amongst the Lombardes, which made you your choice of?


Guaz.
Of those of mine owne countrie.


Annib.
And of those same, which liked you best?


Guaz.
Those whom I knewe most agreable to my minde, for that as the saying is, like will to like.


Annib.
It is euen so, like as also it is true, that we na|turally abhor thinges, which differ from our nature. Wher|of it commeth, that one which is merily disposed, can not, a|way with one which is heauyly giuen. One that is dul hea|ded, cannot abide one that is sharp witted: and contrary|wise, the mery like of the mery, and the sad of the sad. And therefore we haue to consider, that nature hath put vpon vs twoo persons, wherof the one is common to all men, in so much as they are partakers of reason, and more excel|lent then beastes: the other is proper to euery one, touching the difference which is seene in the countenance and iesture of the body and in the diuersitie of the mindes, wherof euery one tendeth and inclineth not onely to some good, but also to some euill. And by y^t meanes you se y^e one offendeth by arro|gancie, another by obstinacie, another by misreporting, ano|ther by flatering, another by couetousnes, another by vaine|gloriousnes,  you must think that there is not any, in whom there is not some fault or imperfectio~, either greater or lesser then that w^c is in our selues. But forsomuch as at this day we can not finde either friendes or parentes, which are in all pointes agreeable to our disposition and nature, wee must frame our selues to beare with the imperfections of others and according to the saying, we must loue a freend with his imperfection. And for that perfect and vertuous men are rare in the world, with whom we might liue to our heartes desire, wee ought not to reiect the companie of any,

so that he haue in him any shewe of vertue and goodnesse. * But to be acceptable in companie, we must put of as it were our own fashions and manners, and cloath our selues with the conditions of others, and imitate them so farre as reason will permit. And in some, touching the respect of honestie and vertue, we ought to be alwayes one and the same. But touching the diuersitie of the persons with whom we shall be conuersaunt, we must alter our selues into an other: according to that olde saying, The heart altogether vnlike, and the face altogether like to the peo|ple. And he, which shall not frame him selfe to doe this, * shall bee driuen to curse Conuersation, and to pray vnto God with the snayle (as it is in the Fable) that to auoyde yll neighbours and naughtie companie, he will giue him the grace to be able to carrie his house about with him. Neither ought any to persuade him selfe that he is without fault, for I am sure if I should refuse the companie of a ca|uilling contentious fellowe, he woulde perhappes refuse mine for some greater imperfection. And therefore I an of opinion, that without looking too precisely vpon one fault, we ought to admit the companie of all those, who in the rest of their woorkes and actions walke vprightly. And it is lawfull likewise, sometime to make as though we se not their faultes, and that we haue a good opinion of them.
Touching this point, I remember the doinges of the Duke of Neuers, who making a feast in this Citie, com|mitted the charge of inuyting the Gentlewomen, to a young man, that was reputed to be very vicious and naught: wher|at the Citizens meruailed not a litle, forsomuche as his ex|cellencie was aduertised long before of the qualities of this fellowe: and herevpon some of the Ladies being in fami|liar talke, fell to a kinde of playe, by the priuiledge where|of, one of them was inioyned to demaund of the Duke, why, being so many young Gentlemen in the Citie of great wis|dome and good behauiour, he caused the Gentlewomen

to be bidden to the feast, by a dishonest and ill disposed per|son: to whom he answered, that he was sure the good and he shoulde alwayes well agre together, and therefore hee thought it nedefull by some meanes to winne the good will of the ill.


Guaz.
I vnderstande you, he meant to imitate him which light his candell before the ymage of the Diuell. Yet in my opinion to fauour the ill, is to offende the good: and I meruaile howe a Prince of so discrete iudgement, coulde make so vndiscrete a choice. But I thinke hee did it, as hee, who hauing not long tyme to soiourne there, sought by all meanes, to make euery one thinke well of him, after his departure: and like vnto the Sunne, hee woulde spread the beames of his bountie vppon all sortes of persons. But you may assure your selfe, he woulde not haue made such a choice in his owne Countrie, where hee is not to learne to put a difference betwene the qualities of his subiectes, to lift vpp the good, and throwe downe the e|uill.


Annib.
I thinke verily that it is requisite so to do, but I doe not thinke he had any such meaning as you speake of. For wise men of good iudgement, his likes take no care to be beloued of the ill, but knowe that when they are well accounted of by the ill, they are ill thought of by the good.


Guazzo.
I am verily perswaded, that all men of vn|derstanding, bestowe great labour to get the good wil, yea e|uen of the most wicked: and for my part, by my wil, I would not haue the ill wil of any, whether good or bad. And I pray God to giue me the grace to be able to satisfie throughly all sortes of persons.


Annib.
You shoulde then haue a speciall priuiledge aboue all other men. But call to minde the old prouerbe, that Iupiter himselfe pleaseth not all. I neuer yet hither|vnto knewe man so good and vertuous, which hath not ben subiect to the malice and slaunders of some one: and

I say resolutely vnto you, that as not caring to know what reporte goeth of you, nor to content any, you shall playe but an arrogaunte and proude parte: so will you become too scrupulous, and will neuer be healed of your sickenesse, if you thinke to stoppe euerie ones mouth: Whiche were to eate vp your heart, as they say. Take hede onely to content the good, and neuer take care what the euill say or thinke of you: For their iniuries can not hurt vertue and innocencie. And knowe you, that the diuine Philosopher willeth vs to take no care for that, whiche the multitude reporteth of vs, but onelye for that, whiche a wise and discrete man giueth out.


Guaz.
Doe you not se, that when a strange Gen|tleman commeth to visite vs at our house, howe care|full wee are to prouide that his seruauntes bee well in|treated? That is for nothing else but for feare least af|terwarde they make some yll reporte of vs: where we are sure, the maisters will content them selues with the en|tertainment we giue them.


Annib.
I thinke that seruauntes, being naturally blabbes and full of tongue, we doe it rather in hope that they will set foorth our curtesie, then for feare that they shoulde finde faulte with our couetousnes: and, besides, our good will and curtesie can not be fully shewed of vs, nor gratefully accepted of the head, if it extende not to the members. You knowe also, that there are certaine maisters of that nature, that they loue in a manner bet|ter the ease and good vsage of their seruauntes, then of them selues: And therefore all the good cheare bestowed on them, is in respect of their maisters. But howesoeuer it be, I am resolute in this, that we ought to doe well for the loue of vertue, and not for the feare of euill re|port.


Guaz.
There are some whiche doe well, not for the loue of vertue, nor yet for the feare of infamie, but vpon

a brauery: like as those who at faires and markets vse great liberalitie, in bestowing fayrings on Gentlewomen, and then pinch for it, when they come home in their owne hou|ses, and perchaunce kepe from the poore seruants their wa|ges.


Annib.
That liberalitie is like the match of a Candle, which must nedes faile foorthwith, and therefore their re|nowme lasteth no longer then the faire. And they may well be compared to certaine litle beasts called Ephemeres, which are bred nere the riuer of Hyppan in Scithia, whose life la|steth onely one day. And me thinkes those men make profes|sion to loose their credite at home, to get it abroade: Notwith|standing, when the stinking breath commeth from the sto|make, it booteth not much to put some swete thing in the mouth, to leaue there a pleasant smell: for at length the ill sauour surmounteth,  it is not possible but the taste of the vessel must be felt. Therefore these may thinke themselues wel ynough dealt withal, to bee put in the rowe of the other tollerable. But Gentleman, I haue suffred my selfe to be so farre carried away with the pleasantnesse of your speche, that I neuer thought howe some of that time is slipt away, which I ought to haue bestowed in visiting my patients. Seing then, that we se, that conuersation is profitable and necessarie, that men of euil life are to bee eschewed, y^e those who wrie rather to the good, the~ the euil, are to be tollerated, and that the good and vertuous are to be desired: I will for this time take my leaue of you,  to morrowe I wil returne hither, if it please you, to discourse another houre of the ciuil and commendable manners of conuersation, according to our determination.


Guaz.
Your returne shalbee more gratefull vnto me, then your departure, and I assure you, this little space be|twene, will seme passing long vnto me: goe in Gods name, and returne after, to redouble my comfort.


Annib.
The comfort wil be mutual, for that our loue is mutual. Farewel.


An ende of the first Booke.



 The second Booke of ciuile conuersa|tion, written by M. Steuen Guazzo.
Wherein is discoursed, first of the manner of conuersati|on, meete for all persons, which shal come in any companie, out of their owne houses, and then of the particular points, which ought to bee obserued in companie betweene yong men, and old, gentlemen, and yomen, Princes and priuate persons, learned, and vnlearned, citizens, and straungers, re|ligious, and secular, men, and women.

Guazzo.
_I Am not able fully to expresse (M. Annibal) howe long the time of your absence hath se|med vnto mee, nor howe ear|nestly I haue longed for the comfort of your returne, by reason of the profitable and pleasant discourses, which this day I hope for at your hands. For me thinkes I see * the hand of so great a Philosopher as you are, * to cast a gol|den net into the large sea of morall Philosophie, to inclose therein, in short time, all the diuine precepts which apper|taine to our life.


Annib.
Nay looke not I pray you for that, for therin you shal but do as the countrie fellow did, who attended in vaine that the riuer should finish his course, that hee might haue gone ouer it. I neither can, neither ought in these discourses to followe the steps of the auncient Philosophers, for albeit their reasons be at this day the same, that they were a thou|sand yere since, yet neither the times, the men, nor the man|ners are like. I denye not but that there haue ben amongst vs, vniustly brought in, many corrupt customes, repugnant

to the lawes of Philosophie, but they haue by this tyme ta|ken so depe footing and roote, that it is impossible to roote them out. For that the worlde is come to this passe, that it counteth any thing to be lawefull, which is delightful. Wherefore if I shoulde indeuour, by precepts and reasons, to reforme the abuse of the worlde, and to reduce it to the vertuous and auncient custome, I shoulde not onely loose my labour, but be laughed at for my labour. Nowe as there are some thinges, which by reason of the abuse they are growen to, are not to be followed, though they were at first taught vs by good and wise maisters: so there are many thinges whiche of themselues beeing tollerable, yet either by the necessitie of the tyme, or by the since|ritie of our Religion, they are not to bee allow|ed As for example, wee doe not any more forbidde children wyne, before they arriue to the age of eightene yeeres: and the necessitie of the tyme will not let vs to let men from marrying vntill they be sixe and thir|tie yeres olde, and maydes vntill they bee eighteene: and to fulfill Gods commaundementes, after that man and woman are once ioyned together by the bonde of marriage, they can not any way be loosed, or seke di|uorce vppon euery light occasion, as in olde tyme they did, by the consent of the Philosophers: who if they were liuing at this day, woulde in many things refourme their wrytings, and conforme them to the customes of the present time. And for these reasons we must treade out of the auncient path, and take the way which is beaten at this day. Wherefore you must not meruayle, nor lay it to me as a deadly sinne, if in the discourse of ciuile con|uersation, I intreate rather of matters, which in my opi|nion are necessarie for the present tyme, then of mat|ters written in Bookes, and vsed in tyme past, and if I speake rather lyke a mere Citizen, then a Philoso|pher, without taking any care to get by my discourses those prayses and tytles which you haue giuen me, which

I neyther will nor ought to accept, beeing altogether vnfit for me.


Guazzo.
The humilitie which you shewe in this respect doeth exault you higher: yet I dare say this much, that you doe your selfe wrong, to debase in suche sorte, the greate learning wherewith you are indued, as|suring you this, that if I were so little inferiour to you in learning, as I knowe my selfe to be a greate deale, I shoulde exault my selfe muche more then you doe.


Annib.
If you were so much inferiour to me, as I knowe you to be greater, you shoulde commit a greater fault then I, to attribute so much to your selfe. For consi|dering that I come nothing nere to that which you thinke to be in me, you shall offende in arrogancie and vaine|glorie.


Guaz.
But in my minde, making your selfe meaner then you are, you offend in a certaine abiectnesse of minde, or in a kinde of dissembling, rather courtlike, then Philoso|pher like. I thinke you will not commende those, who ha|uing much vnderstanding, stande little or nothing vppon it, or beeing knowen for woorthie men, seke to imbase them|selues * by bearing false witnesse against them|selues. *


Annib.
Truely I cannot but blame them: for to disprayse ones selfe too much, sheweth either some secret ambition, or some manifest basenesse of minde. And I count no lesse woorthie reprehension, those, who on the contrarie, exalting themselues too much, touch (as they say) the firmament with their finger. But I am sure, that in spea|king at this present of my selfe, I haue measured my forces, neither haue I swarued one iote from the trueth.


Guazzo.
Seing we are fallen vppon this mat|ter, tell me I pray you, if you haue any sure reme|die, whereby a man may gouerne and keepe him|selfe

in the midway, so that he suffer not himselfe to be hoy|sed vp into the ayre, like a ball full of winde, neither to fall deadly to the ground, as a body without breath.


Annib.
To finde then the skill of Dedalus, and to kepe the mid way, you must search out the cause of the faulty ex|tremes, and that being once knowen, you shall soone haue the remedie you require. Those faults then growe for the most part of solitarinesse, and for want of experience in the affaires of the world. Which causeth, that into a base mind, there entreth the distrust of his owne doings, and the feare of other mens iudgement. Contrariwise, that in a noble minde there groweth an ouer greate presumption, which transporteth him with an ouerwening of himselfe, and a course account of others. And therefore if these manner of men frequented the companie of those who are wise and learned, there is no doubt but that the doings of other men woulde serue, to the one of them for a spurre, and to the other for a bridle.


Guaz.
There are some doubtles woorthy great blame and mockery, who suffer those good parts, which bee in them to be drowned in their cold and timorous hearts, in like sort as stones are in the water. And I coulde name certaine elo|quent personages, who hauing to speake in the presence of many, become quite dumbe. Some others I haue knowen in like case ready to fall into a sowne. Whereby I iudge them meruaylous vnfortunate, that cannot helpe themselues with those qualities they are indued withall, at such tyme as they stande in most ned of them, and better it were in a manner to be altogether without them.


Annib.
It cannot be denied, but that those men are in|fortunate, but let vs nowe consider the arrogancie of those, who being full of presumption, and blinded with the loue of themselues, se not their owne imperfections, and neuer care to knowe what opinion the worlde hath of them: Which is a signe not onely of presumpteous arrogancy, but also of sencelesse brutishnesse, whereof insue many incon|ueniences, for so much as according to the saying of a

wise fellowe.

Great euill is caused by that ignorance,
which seemeth to it selfe sapience.



Guaz.
It is a smal fault in my fancie, to desire to be ta|ken to be wise, but the worst is, that we wil make our selues also beleue that we are so.


Annib.
Therefore it is sayde, that it is the easiest thing of all other, for one to deceiue himselfe: and I remember I haue read in the life of Esope, that a great personage pas|sing thorowe a strete where were thre slaues to be solde, the one a Gramarian, the other a Musitian, and the thirde Esope: first he asked the Gramarian what he coulde doe, who answered, all things: then he asked the Musitian the like question, who answered as the other did: but com|ming to Esope, he asked him what he coulde doe, who an|swered, nothing at all. Howe happeneth that, sayeth the Gentleman? marie sayth Esope, these twoo here being able to doe all things, haue left nothing for me to doe. Where|by we may see, that those who will not presume to be a|ble to doe any thing, knowe howe to doe most things, and those who take vppon them to knowe all things, are those which commonly knowe nothing at all. For so muche then as we knowe, that for want of knowing and beeing experienced by meanes of conuersation, in the natures, manners, and dooings of others, we offende eyther by arrogancie, or by distrust, you may consequentlie per|ceiue, that the remedie which you seke to flye those ex|tremes, and to followe the meane, is ciuile conuersation, and that chiefly which is practised out of the house, haunting many and diuers persons, whereof we haue to speake this day.


Guaz.
I woulde haue thought by those matters wee spoke of but nowe, that you had ben farre of, from those we are to intreate to day, but I se you haue brought me thyther before I thought of it: whereat I meruayle

the more, and I am gladder of it. But before you be|ginne this discourse, I woulde knowe whether your mea|ning be, to propose one fourme and manner of conuersa|tion, whiche all indifferently shoulde vse, or at the least to assigne diuers sortes, according to the diuersitie of per|sons.


Annib.
As farre as I remember, I tolde you yester|day, and nowe I tell you againe, that I meane to prescribe particularly to euery one: For if in conuersation all of vs shoulde behaue our selues in one sorte towardes all, we shoulde soone come to the chiefe point of our purpose. It is very true, there are some generall thinges which euery one ought to obserue towardes euery one indifferently, whereof also we will vse some spech, but my desire is chiefly, that wee come to consider the diuers meanes which wee ought to vse, in vsing companie, according to the diuersi|tie of persons. Whereby we shall knowe, that it is not so easie to finde one manner of entertainement common to all men, as it is to finde a fashion for a Sadle to fit any Horse. And thereby we shal perceiue, that as a man of good iudgement, such as your selfe, wri|teth not in one selfe manner and wordes to his betters, e|quals, and inferiours, so we in our conuersation ought to proced with the same iudgement, to put difference betwene causes and parties which are not equall.


Guaz.
If then ciuile conuersation ought to varie accor|ding to the varietie of the persons, I doubt mee least the rules, which you shall set downe, wilbe long and hard: for that we are driuen by diuerse accidentes to haue to deale with diuerse persons, differing in sexe, in age, in degre, in conditions, in country, and in nation.


Annib.
You se in organes diuerse pipes, whereof eue|ry one giueth a diuerse sowne, yet they are all proportioned together, and make one onely bodie: in like sort, albeit there be diuerse kindes of entertainemente and conuersation, yet in the end we shall perceiue that they agree together in

such sort, that they seme in a manner one onely sort, and perchaunce more easie then we thinke for. Wherefore to make the matter more easie, we will deuide conuersation into publike, which is abrode with strangers: and priuate, which is at home in the house. And for that both is more then we can dispatch to day, I thinke it shall suffice for this time to discourse onely of publike conuersation, and the o|ther we will reserue for to morrowe.


Guaz.
I looked that you would first haue spoken of this latter, for that by order of nature we begin conuersati|on in the house with those that be of houshold with vs, and after, we learne to conuerse abroade with others.


Annib.
When in our yesterdayes discourse I proposed vnto you conuersation, aswel for the health of the minde, as the body, I meant of publike conuersatio~, out of which espe|cially the fruites and perfection we haue spoken of are ga|thered, and therfore to day we will speake of that, which concerneth our principall purpose. Returning then to my discourse, I make good, that by meanes of ciuil conuersation, a man may not onely clere himselfe of cowardly abiection, and vaine presumption, but besides, cloath himselfe with the knowledge of himselfe. For if you consider it wel, the iudge|ment which we haue to knowe our selues, is not ours, but we borrow it of others: for so much as when wee are by di|uers persons aduertised, blamed, reproued, or by signes made more aduised for some fault, which we commit either in word or ded, at y^e length we are conte~t to submit our selues to the common opinion of al men,  come to acknowledge in our selues some imperfection, which wee indeuour to correct after other mens iudgement. And though it bee harde to finde one that will tell vs flatly the truethe, yet there is not any (at the least being a priuate person) so blinded in him selfe, but if he be faulty any way, by frequenting the companie of others, he shall either haue occasion of|fred him to examine his owne conscience, and so of

him selfe to finde his owne fault, or else at one tyme or another, there shalbee one or other, whiche if not in way of good will, yet in manner of mockerie, or of scorne, or of spyte, or by one way or another, will make him to vnderstande his fault. And as these same as it were against their wills are driuen to amende their manners and life, so you see many of good iudgement, and lesse ouersene in themselues, who, without tarying vntill they bee reprooued of others, are mooued of their owne proper will, to waygh diligently the sayings, the dooings, and the behauiour of others. And as they learne to eschue those thinges which they se to be vn|semely in any, so they indeuour to followe and appro|priate to themselues those things whiche are commenda|ble in others, so that by Conuersation they become markers and imitatours of wise men, and such as are patternes to be practised by. To bee shorte, they frame themselues to doe, to leaue, to chaunge, to correct many things according to the iudgement of others. But se|ing we haue alreadie at large discoursed, of the greate force, whiche vniuersall opinions haue for the amendement of our life, I will stande no longer vppon that point, and seing we are assured that our iudgements, and the knowledge of our selues, dependeth of the iudgement and conuersation of many, I will enter to speake of the man|ner of conuersation abroade: wherein, for the reasons and respectes we alledged yesterday, I will haue regarde to the common profite, and specially of those of small vnderstan|ding, minding not to searche thorowly the morall ver|tues whiche euery one can not comprehende, but to set foorth onely the principall points, whiche are required in this conuersation. Neyther will I in any wise mount to the toppe of tres, but satisfying in some parte so learned a man as you are, for the rest, I make account to speake to persons of weake capacitie, and therefore I will indeuour to

present them with such thinges as are not out of their reach.


Guaz.
Your discourses shall so much the better con|tent me, by how much the more they shalbe familiar, and suche as are mete for the weakenesse of my vnderstan|ding.


Annib.
It is but your modestie to say so. Nowe com|ming first to the generall points, I am perswaded that the knowledge and contemplation of nature is imperfect in man, if actions be not thereto adioyned. And therefore if to students which liue in contemplation, conuersation be necessarie, it is no doubt muche more necessarie to those whiche haue no learning at all: Who, that they may not remaine as brute beastes, but be knowen to differ from them, ought to indeuour to learne that at the mouth of another, whiche by their owne studie they can not at|taine vnto. Like as then it is reported, that certaine people vsed to dresse and heale those that were sicke openly in the stretes, and being carefull of their health, demaunded of those which passed by, if they knewe any remedie for their diseases: so the solitarie man, who is in very dede sicke, and bereft of the knowledge whiche is gotten by the proofe of other mens iudgement, hath nede to seke remedie a|broade out of the house. And though perchance hee mete with some more sicke then himselfe, and with others per|haps incurable, yet let him not cease to goe forwarde, vntil such time he finde such as are in health to comforte him, and Phisitions to heale him. Hauing respect to the sen|tence of him which saide, Of the wise thou shalt learne to make thy selfe better, of fooles, to make thy selfe more aduised.


Guaz.
Though men were not induced to goe foorth of their house and frequent the companie of others, for the causes by you alledged, yet I warrant you there want not other spurres, which pricke them forwarde into compa|nie,

and make them presse into places where they se the greatest throng of people: for the desire to maintaine and increase their wealth, and to mende their estate, will not suffer men to stande ydle with their handes at their gyrdels, whiche you shall plainely see, if you once set your foote in the Court of some Prince, where you shall se an infinite number of Courtiers assemble to|gether, to talke and deuise of many matters, to vnder|stande the newes of the death or confiscation of the goods of some one, to seeke to obtaine of the Prince, eyther promotions, goods, pardons, exemption, or pri|uiledge for them selues or others: and before they will craue suche thinges, to procede thereto by meanes, and to practise the fauour of the Secretaries, and other Offi|cers. And you shall haue there besides, other good fel|lowes, conspyring together, and secretly deuising howe to bring some Officer into the disfauour of his Prince, that he may be put from his office, and some other placed in his roome. And if this be not ynough to giue you to vnderstande the pleasure whiche is receiued by these com|panies, beholde the preasse of people whiche heapeth toge|ther at the iudgement place, as oftentymes it hath ben my happe to see in the great Palace of the Parliament of Pa|ris, whiche sounding with an infinite number of voices, while the plaintife and the defendant pleade, semeth to be shaken, as it were with an earthquake. But why alledge I forraine examples, let vs passe only thorow the middest of this Citie, and we shall se not only on dayes appointed for trauaile, but on those also whiche are consecrated to the honour and seruice of God, a numberlesse multitude walking vpp and downe in euery place, keping a con|tinuall mercate, where there is no other talke but of buying and selling, of chopping and chaunging, of letting and taking money to interest, and in summe, there is bar|gayning for all thinges, whiche are fit to heale the dis|eases

of pouertie, and to get the health of riches. And therefore there nedeth not muche labour to perswade men to loue conuersation, whereto they are naturally so gi|uen.


Annib.
By this your speche, you haue brought to my remembraunce a place of Pythagoras, where he sayde that this worlde was nothing else but a verie mer|cate, where there mete thre sortes of men, the one to buy, the other to sell, and the thirde to looke on, who (he sayde) were the Philosophers, whom hee counted the happiest of them all.


Guaz.
In Pythagoras tyme belyke there were no cut-purses which vsed the mercates, otherwise he woulde haue put them in amongst the other.


Annib.
Another vsed likewyse to say, that this world was a stage, we the players whiche present the Comedie, and the gods, the lookers on, amongest whom belike hee comprehended the Philosophers. But for that at this day there are fewe diuine lookers on, and that we whiche are the players, are in a manner all of vs giuen to play those partes which you haue spoken of, I will propose vnto you a kinde of conuersation, not to stande vs chiefly in stede in markets, Comedies, and other outwarde things subiect to fortune, but to the ende we may thereby learne good man|ners and conditions, by meanes whereof, the giftes of for|tune are distributed and conserued, and the fauour and good will of others obtained.


Guaz.
It is your part then to shewe, howe those ver|tues and conditions may be learned.


Annib.
Being so, that the solitary person is sicke, I prescribe for his health this medicine, that for a long tyme, he indeuour by conuersation to bring to passe, that the reuenewes of his house be farre greater then the ex|pense.


Guaz.
Marie most men doe so: but me thinkes in com|panie those whiche spende frely, are better thought of

then those which spare niggardly. And if you call to remem|brance, the doings vsed of olde tyme in Rome, you shall per|ceiue that to gratifie, and giue to many persons, was a meane whereby the loue and good will of the people was gotten, and it serued as a ladder, to climbe to the highest dig|nities and promotions.


Annib.
A wise man being asked, why nature hath gi|uen vs twoo eares, and but one tongue: to that ende (answe|red he) that we shoulde heare muche, and speake little. That answere gaue me occasion, to attribute to the eares, the reuenewe, and to the tongue, the expence. And to the ende I may be better vnderstoode, I say, that in conuersati|on, the vse of twoo things is chiefly requisite, that is, of our tongue, and of our behauiour: wherefore let vs consider of those twoo parts.


Guaz.
Why will you restraine your selfe only to those two parts?


Annib.
For that if you marke it well, we winne chiefly the friendship and good will of other, by the manner of our spech, and by the qualitie of our conditions: yea I might in a certaine manner reduce al conuersation, to that point of manners and behauiour, wherein are likewise co~|prysed our woordes and spech. But for so much as some parte of our talke doeth not wholy depende of manners and behauiour, I wil speake distinctly of those two points. And to enter into the matter, I say, that like as those which are sicke in body, loue and lust after those thinges, which ac|cording to the saying of the Poet,
Are toothsome to the taste, but hindersome to health.
So the ignorant man of weake vnderstanding, which hath nede to kepe silence, is meruaylously delighted to heare him selfe speake: and suche force hath this fault, that alwayes those whiche knowe least, couet to speake most. Seing then to stay the tongue, and vse the eare, are the hardest things that may be it behooueth our patient to frame him selfe too brydle his appetyte,

withstanding his owne will, and inuring himselfe by little and little, to kepe the mouth more shut, and the eares more open. Which hee shall no sooner doe, but he shall perceiue that in companie he shall get the good will and fauour of o|thers, aswell by giuing eare curteously, as by speaking pleasantly. For we thinke, they thinke wel of vs, which are attentiue to our talke, and we se our pleasant speche serueth vs to no purpose, if it bee not hearde of others. Be|sides, our sicke man shall beginne by holding his peace, to recouer his health, and to be well thought of, of the wise. It was therefore that Pithagoras bounde his schollers to kepe silence, for the space of thre yeres, considering that by their diligent giuing eare vnto him, they shoulde be aduer|tised of their owne ignorance, and printing in their hearts the profoundnesse and grauitie of his sentences, they should fele the profite of their patience: according to the old saying, That to a diseased minde, the witty woordes of others serue for a Phisition: and in the ende they shoulde know, that it is no lesse admirable, to knowe howe to holde ones peace, then to know how to speake. For, as wordes wel vttered, shewe eloquence and learning, so silence well kept, sheweth pru|dence and grauitie.


Guaz.
I remember I haue hearde tell, that one being asked, whether ignorance was the cause of his silence: an|swered, That it was incide~t alwayes to the ignorant, not to know how to be silent.


Annib.
And therefore men of meane wit are the more to be commended, if they speake not much: Wherevpon it is said, That it is a pece of wisedome for a man to hide his follie, by holding his tongue: and it is likewise sayd, That he knoweth ynough, who knoweth nothing, if he knowe how to holde his peace. We will then conclude, * that hee who knoweth not how to holde his peace, knoweth not howe to speake, * and he that will learne to speake aduisedly, must giue eare to those which know howe to doe it, remembring that as hunger and thirst is an emptinesse of the body, so is ignorance an emptinesse of the minde: and as the body is fil|led

with foode, so the minde is fedde with vnderstanding: which as we saide yesterday, is sooner gotten by hearing one speake, then by reading of bookes. And therefore hee ought to count it no labour to listen to others, nor shame to aske that which he is ignorant in: but he ought rather to i|mitate that worthie personage, who vsed to say, I question with euerie man, but I answere no man, for that I knowe not how to frame a fit answere to anything.


Guaz.
I am not ignorant that it behoueth one without learning, to speake little, and heare much, and I knowe that by long obseruation of the sentences and discourses of o|thers, he must nedes learne many things: but nowe you haue taught him the profite he is to make by brydling his tongue, I looke you shoulde set him downe the charges he is to be at, in speaking.


Annib.
As money well imployed, turneth both to the commoditie of him that receiueth it, and likewise of him that disburseth it: so woordes well considered, bring prefite to the hearer, and prayse to the speaker. And as out of one purse are drawen diuerse kindes of coyne, as of golde, sil|uer, and baser mettall: so out of the mouth procede senten|ces and woordes of different value. But as it is not lawefull to forge or pay out naughtie mony, so neither is it lawefull to inuent, or speake that thing whiche may turne to the preiudice or reproche of others: For by such forgerie a man not onely shameth himselfe, but besides, put|teth his own life in daunger, which together with his death, is in the power of the tongue. Moreouer, it is written that * the tongue is a little fire, which kindleth greate mat|ters, * and that he which kepeth and represseth his tongue. kepeth his owne soule. Wherefore we haue to conclude, that he which wisheth to be well spoken of by others, must take hede he speake not ill of others. Therefore let him who hath his tongue in his mouth, bee at this point, that though he can not vtter graue and delightfull speches, like vnto Philosophers and Oratours, who are very scant

in the worlde, yet he speake honestly and plainely, as an honest and Christian man ought to doe, * remem|bring alwayes that is better to slip with the foote, then with the tongue. *


Guaz.
As I thinke, I haue read that a king of Egypt, to prooue the iudgement of Solon, sent him a beast to sacri|fice, inioyning him to choose out that part of the beast which he iudged best, and that which hee iudged worst, to sende backe vnto him. Solon to accomplish the kings hestes, sent him only the tongue.

And therefore the tongue is rightly compared to the sterne of a shippe, which being the least parte of it, yet is it of force to saue or sinke the shippe. But of those which put the shippe in daunger of drowning, and which by the venome of their mischieuous tongues procure hurte to others, and blame to themselues, we spake yesterday suffi|ciently, in so much that we haue already excluded them out of the number of the good and desirable: wherefore those which aspire to the degre of vertue, and which will shewe themselues woorthie to be admitted into ciuile con|uersation, ought aboue all things to haue regarde that they offende no man with their tongue. But they shall not be quite discharged of their debt, if besides that, they doe not with their woordes, seke to profite and delight their hea|rers both together, to the ende they may reape all the fruite which the tongue can yeelde: For that the tongue by in|structing, conferring, disputing, and discoursing, doth gather, assemble, and ioyne men together with a certaine naturall bonde. He then that will behaue himselfe wel in ciuile con|uersation, must consider that the tongue is the mirrour, and (as it were) the image of his minde. And that like as wee knowe goodnesse or naughtinesse of mony, by the sounde of it: so by the sounde of woordes, we gather the inwarde qua|lities and conditions of the man. And for that wee are so much the more estemed of, by howe muche our Ciuilitie differeth from the nature and fashions of

the vulgar sorte, it is requisite that we inforce our tongue to make manifest that difference in two principall thinges: in the pleasant grace, and the profounde grauitie of woordes.


Guaz.
I vnderstande you, your meaning is, that as the poore people spende nothing but liards, and other such lyke small monye, so he whom you speake of, shoulde vse no o|ther mony but gold, which is the fairest in shewe, and best in substance. Yet (if I be not deceiued) you are contrary to your selfe, for you tolde me not long since, that it was y|nough to vse plaine and simple speeche, and nowe you will haue him speake with eloquence and wisedome. But seing you haue saide that there are amongst vs but fewe Orators and Philosophers, howe shall I, and such as I am doe, that haue no golde to spende, and who can not in companie be ei|ther Demosthenes or Plato. Is it your minde wee shall re|turne to the schoole, to learne Rhetorike and Philosophy?


Annib.
I will neuer vnsay, that I haue once said, but I make good, that a man ought to procede in common talke simply and plainly, according as the truth of the matter shal require: notwithstanding, if you consider how in Uillages, Hamlets, and fields, you shall finde many men, who though they leade their life farre distant from the graces and Mu|ses (as the prouerb is) and come stamping in with their high clouted shooes, yet are of good vnderstanding, whereof they giue sufficient testimonie by their wise and discrete talke: you cannot denie, but that nature hath giuen and sowed in vs certaine sedes of Rhetorike and Philosophie. But for that the more those good partes appeare in a man, the better he is accepted in all companies, I would haue him aide na|ture with a little art, and seke to furnish himself with such good giftes, that he make himselfe place, bee desired, honou|red, and estemed in any honest companie he shall come in.


Guaz.
Yea Syr, but take hede least eloquence be not counted natural, by diuers woorthy persons, yea and it is much misliked of, when it swarueth from the co~mon phrase

and fourme of spech, which we vse with wife, children, ser|uantes and friendes. For that wee ought to be content to expresse our minde without affectation, without paine, and without any pompe: For if any of those be added, it is besides the trueth, and sheweth a superfluitie of woordes, whose proper office ought to bee only to vtter our conceiued mea|ning. And in trueth, wherefore serue so many perephrases and circumlocutions, so many translations and figures, being able to set foorth matters, and touche them brieflie, in proper and plaine termes. In my minde it may be saide, that these professours of eloquence, vnder the colour of an Oratour, playe the parte of a Poet: and by the feigning of woordes, shewe the little plaine dealing that is in them.


Annib.
To make you answere, I must aske you this question, whether you thinke the men of olde time to haue spoken better, or these of our time?


Guaz.
These of this age in my fansie, for that it is easie to bewtifie and amplifie things, when they are once brought in.


Annib.
I am of your minde, for that in times paste they had not suche rules to direct them in speaking, as now adayes are set downe: they had not such Art and Methode, nor suche meane to helpe them selues with Proemes, or by disposing and deuiding of their matters, or by proouing them by places and argumentes: but for all this, you must not thinke but that our manner of speaking is as naturall as theirs was.


Guaz.
I count it naturall, for so muche as the rude speche of the countrie Clowne, is as naturall to him, as the fine and polished, is to the Citizen and Gentleman.


Annib.
You see then euerie thing to be naturall, which nature consenteth to haue made better and more perfect: and therefore as it is a thing vnsemely and vnnaturall in talke to straie to farre from fit and vsuall matters, so it can not but be commended and saide to bee naturall, when in ones talke to necessarie thinges some what is added, whereby

the matter is amended. And for so muche as all men na|turally indeuour them selues in speche, to persuade and to mooue, it is certaine that a sentence hath so much the more or lesse force and vigour, according to the difference of persons from whom it commeth, and of the words by which it is vttered. So that our chiefe labour must bee to mooue the heartes of the hearers: and we must weigh this, that nothing can enter into their hearts, which is not currantly spoken, and without offence to the eares: and therefore we must labour to haue (as Bias saide) a comely grace in hol|ding our peace, and a liuely force in speaking.


Guaz.
If then your meaning be we shoulde mooue af|fections, and persuade mens mindes with the tongue, you can not chuse but you must haue recourse to the preceptes of Rhethorike, which are not for euery mans capacitie.


Annib.
I thinke it neither necessary nor conuenient in this place to speake of those preceptes, because I will not seme desirous to take the penne out of the hande of those which write of eloquence, which were nothing els but to seke to take the lightning from Iupiter.


Guaz.
He which can speake by art, as you can, muche more easily shall he bee able to discourse of art when ned shall require.


Annib.
But being not in me to discourse of art, I shall lesse be able to speake by art. But admit I could doe both the one and the other, wee haue alreadie agreed, not to med|dle with those matters which euery one can not vnderstand Wherefore touching that point, I will do no otherwise then discrate Phisitions are accustomed to doe, who hauing re|spect to the pouertie of some of their Patientes, heale them not with Rubarbe, Manna, or other costly medicines, but in stede thereof, woorke their cure with hearbes and sim|ples, and suche remedies as without paine or charge are commonly to be founde in euerie fielde, house, and Gar|deine. So likewise, the most part of men being sicke, and so depriued of vnderstanding, that they are not able to at|teine

to those high and profound secrets, which are as it were in the marow and pith of the institutions of Rethorike, we will laye before them those things, which at the least grow about the Barke. For though they be not of great price, yet neuerthelesse they shall be of great profite to the diseased. I say then, that our tongue shall bring foorth wordes which shall haue force to stirre vp mens mindes, and in goodli|nesse and goodnesse, both they shall represent that gold wher|of we haue made mention, so that there be a little labour bestowed in the action, iesture, and pronouncing of the woordes, which hath great force and power in speche. And albeit the orations of Demosthenes are ull of eloquence and wit, yet it is saide, That in Demosthenes there lac|keth the greatest parte of Demosthenes: for that they are not liuely pronounced, but set downe to be read in dead let|ters. And verily I haue knowne many so delightfull in their discourses, notwithstanding they haue ben vaine and to small purpose, that by the swete and pleasant deliuerie and pronouncing of their spech, they haue gotten the com|mendation to bee able to speake verie well.


Guaz.
Many Courtiers carie that litle pece of suger in their mouthes, and it may bee saide, that their money semeth to be Golde, although in the touche it is found to be siluer, or baser mettall. But I am of opinion in this, that we suffer our eares to be too muche tickled, where|by we giue wrong iudgement of the matter, beeing more attentiue to the sounde of the woordes, then to the waight of the sentences, giuing the tytle of Oratour, to suche a one as is but a brabler, and altogether without lear|ning.


Annib.
I am fully of your minde, and thereof it com|meth, that many times certaine verses like vs verie well, and seme to be set foorth with all the pleasant vaine of Poe|try, when we heare some tumbler or Dauncer sing them to the Harp, but if you come to read, them afterwards, you wil think the~ sottish  vaine. The like befalleth to many others,

who in speaking are verie well liked of, and no fault to be founde in them, but let them come to writing any thing, and they are no bodie. But that we haue no meruayle here|of, I must say vnto you, that those same persons are not in deede eloquent, but that all their force and vertue lieth in the swete deliuerie of their wordes, which though they bee neither well placed, neither verie pithie or sententious, yet they make to the eares and the minde a most delightfull Harmonie, which possesseth vs in suche sorte, that wee nei|ther searche after, nor desire for any thing besides.


Guaz.
Then it is no meruayle on the contrarie, that many knowe howe to vse pure and fine filed speche, and yet want the gift of pronuntiation, which is so yl in them, that thereby their woordes loose their grace and authoritie. But for so muche as this parte of action hath force to make men estemed of aboue their desertes, I shoulde bee verie glad if you woulde shewe me wherein consisteth this ver|tue.


Annib.
Seing the other good parts, which are in you, are accompanied with this same also, I can not beleue but you knowe well enough by what meanes you haue got|ten it.


Guaz.
I knowe not howe I may beleue, that you be|leue so, for I knowe that I neuer learned any precept of Rethorike.


Annib.
You are the more happie to haue attained to that without trauayle, which others can not come to, with much studie.


Guaz.
Doe you not knowe that he is not happie, which doeth not knowe him selfe to be happie.


Annib.
Though you are ignorant of the partes of this action, yet you knowe in your selfe the gift of good deliuery of spech, and that you possesse that gift. And for my part I confesse vnto you, I haue not bestowed muche studie about those pointes. But if your pleasure be, that we shal roaue at them, perchaunce we shall come neare the marke of the Au|thours of Rethorike.



Guaz.
Euen as it shall please you.


Annib.
I consider first of all, that the first part of acti|on consisteth in the voice, which ought to measure it forces, and to moderate it selfe in suche sort, that though it straine it selfe somewhat, yet it offend not the eares by a rawe and harshe sownde, like as of stringes of instrumentes when they breake, or when they are yll striken.


Guaz.
To say the trueth, that is the pronuntiation of the most part of our Monferins, and muche more of those of Piemount, who with the shrilnesse of their wordes goe thorow ones eares.


Annib.
Yet we must take hede we speake not so soft|ly that we can scarce be heard.


Guaz.
That is the voyce of Hypocrites, and our holy Ankers, who seme to speake with the mouth of death.


Annib.
Nexte, we must take hede to bring forth our woordes distinctly, and to separate the sillables: mary in suche sorte that we set not foorth euerie letter, as litle chil|dren doe when they learne to reade, which is a verie vn|pleasant hearing.


Guaz.
The people of Verona and Venice, seme to erre in that.


Annib.
But on the other side, it is not mete to vtter+ous wordes in suche hast, that like meate, in the mouth of one almost starued, they be swallowed downe without chewing


Guaz
It is vsed of the Genowayes and those of Cor|a.


Annib.
And therefore it is necessarie to vse a meane, that the pronuntiation be neither too swift nor too flow. But we must take hede aboue all thinges, that the last sillables be heard plainly, least we fall into the fault of some, who suffer the last letters to die betwene their teth. Like as he who for feare to say amisse, durst bring foorth neither Tempum nor Tempus, but Tempt, and therefore we must speake freely, without supping vp our woordes, and bringing them but halfe foorth.



Guaz.
Louers commonly vse such vncertaine and bro|ken speches.


Annib.
We must likewise take hede we speake not out of the throate, like one that hath some meate in his mouth which is too hotte, or els is almost choaked with the reume.


Guaz.
This is the imperfection of the Florentines and those of Luqua: who haue their throates full of aspirati|ons.


Annib.
Some others offende as muche, who opening their mouth too muche, fill it with winde, and make the woordes resowne within, as an Eccho doeth in Caues and hollowe places.


Guaz.
As I think, that is the natural custome of those of Mantua and Cremona, wherin those of Naples also kepe them company.


Annib.
Lastly, the voyce must be neither fainte like one that is sicke, or like a begger: neither shrill nor loud like a crier, or like a schoolemaister, which doeth dictate or re|hearse to his scholers some theame or epistle. For it would be saide, as it was saide to one, If thou singest, thou singest yll, if thou readest, thou singest.


Guaz.
I doe not thinke for all that, you woulde haue vs in speaking vse alwayes one tune and measure.


Annib.
No verily, for the pleasure of spech, so wel as of Musicke, procedeth of the chaunge of the voyce, yea, (to ende this talke) I woulde haue you know, that as we some|times stande, sometimes walke, sometimes sit, without continuing long in either of them, so the change of the voice, * like an instrument of diuers strings, * is verie acceptable, and easeth both the hearer and the speaker: and yet we must se that this change be made with discretion in time  place, according to the qualitie of the woordes, and the diuersitie of the sentences and sayinges.


Guaz.
As far as I se, you haue nothing els to say tou|ching this action.



Annib.
No more touching the voyce, but there is an other parte, which perteineth to the iesture, whereof per|chaunce it were better to say nothing, then speake too litle, for that there belong vnto it so many circumstances, that for my part I am not able to rehearse them.


Guaz.
It is muche in my opinion to kepe a certaine maiestie in the iesture, which speaketh as it were by vsing silence, and constraineth as it were by way of commaunde|ment, the hearers to haue it in admiration and reue|rence.


Annib.
Yet herein is required such a moderation, that a man with too litle be not immoueable like an image, neither with too much, too busie like an Ape: and as the one stirring no parte, thinking to get the opinion of grauitie, incurreth the suspition of folly, and is taken for a feigned person, brought in to speake, hauing of him selfe no life, so the other by the libertie of his iestures, thinking to vse a plausible kinde of curtesie, whereby to winne fauour, speaketh a playerlike kinde of lightnesse, whereby he getteth discom|mendation. I will not in this place aduise him that spea|keth to holde his head vpright, to take hede of licking or byting the lippes, and to se the woordes agre to the iesture, as the daunce doeth to the sowne of the instrument: nei|ther likewise doe I thinke it mete to admonishe the hea|rer to take hede of rude lowtishe lookes, of wrying the bo|die aside, of too set a grauitie in lookes, of too sower a coun|tenaunce, of gazing about him, of whispering in any o|thers eare, of laughing without occasion, of gaping too wide, of shewing him selfe greued at the speakers wordes, and of all those thinges whereby you may either amaze him that speaketh, or els seme to be wearie of his talke. I will not, I say, speake of these thinges, for I should but make a recitall of Galatee, and those bookes, whiche the morall Philosophers and Rhetoritians haue written vppon this matter. These are thinges whiche are learned, not so muche by readyng, as by vsing com|pany,

for when an other speaketh, we marke what liketh and what disliketh, and by that we knowe what we ought to auoyde and what to followe: as when wee our selues speake, and that wee se some of the hearers litle attentiue, or some other way to vse some yll behauiour, we learne by his inciuilitie how we ought to behaue our selues in hea|ring others. It shall suffice then to say for this time, that touching this action, wee must frame all the bodie in suche sort, that it seme neither to be of one whole immooueable lumpe, neither yet to bee altogether loosely disioynted.


Guaz.
That is, we must imitate those which neither Saintlike are too ceremonious, neither Iugglerlike are too quicke and too full of action.


Annib.
Iust. But aboue all, it behooueth him, which by his action is willing to mooue an ether, to fele first some motions in him selfe, and to drawe foorth the affections of his heart, in suche sort, that the hearers seing them shew without the eyes, may be mooued by the verie countenance of him that speaketh.


Guaz.
This same in my iudgement is one of the best and necessariest aduertisementes which you haue hythervn|to giuen: for that the ende of the speaker, being to stirre vp the affections of others, he ought to take paine in it. And it can not be that you shoulde be sorowfull for my mis|hap, if while I recount it vnto you, you perceiue not me to be sorowfull Neither can I possibly wring the teares from your eyes, vnlesse I first wipe them from mine owne. To be short, one thing can not giue to an other that which it selfe hath not. And I say againe, that this is a notable precept: whereby you put me in minde of some persons whom I knowe happily indowed with this gift. And amongest other, my Lorde the most reuerend Archbishop of Thurin, Seigneur Hierosme de la Rouere, who, by his lear|ning eloquence, good conuersation and godly life, began euen from his infancie to make all men haue him in admiration, and to be very well thought of in all companies he com|meth

in, and yet he is become so expert in this action, which you haue proposed, that not only by his swete, filed, graue, and distinct words: but also by the windowes of his eyes, by the clearenesse of his countenance, and by the semelynesse of his gestures, he doeth so open within his commendable affections, that on the one side, and the other, he carryeth away mens heartes whither it pleaseth him.


Annib.
You se then, that the inwarde action ought to Goe before the outwarde, so that the sounde of the wordes, and the motions of the body, be thrust forwarde by the af|fections of the hearte. * And of all this our discourse, we may gather this, that there is aswell eloquence of body, as of mind, and that many are counted elequent, for some or for only one part of Rethorike, which is iustified by the ex|ample of Apuleius, who was iudged most eloquent, for his countenance, gesture, and comely moouing of the body, with the which good partes, he more allured his auditours, then with copie of wordes. It is saide further, that Hortensius tooke more paines in trimming vp his body, then in fra|ming of his speache: so that it was doubtfull whether men ranne rather to beholde him, then to heare him. So great a|grement is there betwene the words and the countenance, and the countenance and the wordes. * Now for somuch as we haue saide, and concluded, as muche as is sufficient touching the tongue, it is requisite we come to those partes which consist in manners: and as hytherto we haue intrea|ted of the bewtie of golde, nowe we must consider of the va|lue of it.


Guaz.
You haue in few wordes so well satisfyed me touching Action, that nowe you make me desirous to heare some other point touching talke. And as that which you haue hether vnto said, concerneth only the pronuntiation of wordes, and the gestures of the body, so I woulde be very glad it might now please you to speake of those points, which apperteine to the ornament and bewtifiyng of speach: which discourse wyll not excede the capacitie of men of meane vn|derstanding.



Annib.
I haue already tolde you that we must not climbe vp that great tre, to gather the fruites which are on the top of it, for that we shall haue much to do to get thither, and fewe there be that will be able to followe vs: and we ought to thinke our selues wel, that we haue reached with our handes, those fewe leaues, and flowers which hang ouer our head. And for that the chiefest vertue is to abstaine from vice, I first admonishe him, which taketh pleasure in ciuile conuersation, to eschewe all things which make the talke lesse delightfull to the hearers: as, to vse more briefe|nesse then is requisite, for the plain setting foorth of the mat|ter he hath vndertaken to speake of, which troubleth much the hearers. For as if they were iuditially to examine an offendour, they shall bee driuen by continuall demaundes forcibly to wring foorth of his mouth those things, which (to explane the matter throughly) he ought to vtter without asking. But on the other side, he must not vse superflu|ous wordes, nor be tedious to his hearers with long Pre|faces, and other impertinent circumstances besides the matter, whiche sheweth him a vaine trifler, without iudge|ment, and maketh him nothing acceptable to his Audi|tors.


Guaz.
By many wordes many imperfections are dis|couered, and as a wise man saide, If to haue the tongue still walking and iabbering were a signe of wisedome, the Swallowes might verily be saide to be more sage then vs.


Annib.
* Therevpon it is that the lawmaker, being asked why he ordeined so fewe lawes for the Lacedemoni|ans: Answered, that a fewe lawes were enough for those that vsed but fewe wordes. * But those which vse va|rietie, and intreate of diuers matters, though they vse many wordes, yet they weary not their hearers, so much as those doe, who according to the Prouerbe, Make of the flie, an Elephant, and of a matter of nothing, along tale, * which

Agesilaus finding fault with, saide he liked not of that Shoomaker, which made a great shooe for a little foote. * There are many other imperfections of speache, which I will not rehearse, for that he whiche giueth attentiue eare, shall be well able to discerne, and knowe them in him who speaketh yll. I will say that amongest other faultes, there is one common to the most part of men, who by negli|gence vse to repeate some one worde verie often and some there are, who speaking by the mouth of another, rehearse often this (sayth he) which is very vnsemely. Another at the beginning of euery sentence, commeth in with (nowe Syr): and some there are, who when they will not or can not signifie thinges by their proper names, in stede thereof say (what shal I call it.)


Guaz.
The first faulte of these last rehearsed, is very vnsemely for him which speaketh, but much more for him which writeth, and I haue noted, that many hauing some speciall affection to some woorde, or to some manner of speache, haue sowed it in a thousande places, and in euery leafe of their booke coulde not refraine from continuall re|petition of the same wordes, or phrases of speache. And therefore there are, whiche say, the writinges of Bembo woulde haue better grace, if these wordes (Paeuentenole, fortuneuole, and suche like) were not so often inserted in them, whiche gaue occasion to the Cardinall Farnese to say iestingly, as hee behelde a house at Bologne, built with many windowes, Questa casa secundo il Bembo  mol|to fenestreuole.


Annib.
We must in our talke take hede of those faultes, and others suche like, other aduertisementes which I can at this time giue, touching the commendable pointes in talke, are that euery one indeuour to expresse the thinges whereof he speaketh, so plainely, that he maketh them sene and touched, as it were with the finger, vsing wordes proper, significant, and of efficacie.



Guaz.
I count him most happy which hath that grace, and I knowe some Gentlemen so meruellous in that point, that they wil force their hearers, to receiue pleasure and do|lour, to laugh and wepe, according to the qualitie of their discourses: by the which (like Orphee and Amphion) they will drawe them whither pleaseth them. But I knowe not whether you haue marked some, who on the other side, la|bouring to speake plainly and effectually, become more ob|scure and lesse delightfull, whereby it commeth to passe, which is saide, that by too much spurring, the horse is made dull.


Annib.
That fault commeth of affectation, which is aboue all things to bee auoyded, as a thing odious and fruit|lesse:  you know wel that to those which giue eare to their owne wordes, it happeneth as to those, who the more they force themselues to beholde the Sunne, the more they make their eyes runne on water: And therefore it behooueth euery one to measure his forces, and to know that a man ought to speake no better then he can.


Guaz.
I haue tried in my selfe that to be most true which you say, and I haue noted some, who the more they striued to shewe themselues, the more did they ouerthrowe themselues, verifiyng the saying of the Poet.

He which will climbe too high,
doeth seeke to catch a fall:
What God hath giuen to man, let him
content himselfe withall.



Annib.
Moreouer, sometimes suche matters come in talke, wherein negligent carelessenesse in wordes, is more acceptable then diligent curiousnesse: and nowe and then common and familiar wordes, set foorth the matters which are handled, farre better then Tragicall and stately words doe. I mainteine not for all this, that a man nede take no care howe he speaketh: for it is a thing as blame worthie to speake dissolutely, as to speake difficultlie: and it is as great a fault in common and knowne matters to vse curi|ous affectation, as it is in great and waightie matters to

shewe himselfe negligent, and void of consideration. Wher|fore a man of good iudgement will knowe howe to flie these extreames, and to vse in time and place, wordes and senten|ces, either more or lesse graue, according to the diuersitie of places, times, matters,  persons, to whom he shall speake: which likewise writers vse to obserue in their workes. But in any wise I aduise him to bestowe more paine about the sense, then the wordes: for that most commonly in busiyng his braine about the vaine pompe of wordes, he doeth not conceiue the matter so well, nor contriue it in such order, as hee ought to doe: and with Esopes Dogge, letteth fall the fleshe, to catche the shadow. And we must make account, that as the guest fedeth not himselfe with the smoke of the meate, nor the Host payeth himselfe with the sowne of the money, so the hearer, doeth not content him selfe only with the smoke or sowne of goodly wordes. To be short, goodly wordes without good sense, are not wordes, but rather tri|fles.


Guaz.
* I thinke there are fewe able to attaine to the excellencie of Focion, who is saide to vse few wordes, con|taining in them muche matter: as if he shoulde compare wordes to mony, which is so muche the more estemed, by howe muche lesser it is in quantitie, and greater in value.


Annib.
This is, no doubt, a rare and singuler gift, but he which cannot attaine to it, ought at the least to knowe, that vnpolished wisedome is more commended, then flori|shing filed speache, voide of wit. And as in money we doe not chiefly consider the fourme, and the stampe, but the weight, and the matter whereof it is made, so in speach we ought not to looke so much to the grace and finesse of it, as to the grauitie and goodnesse of it. * And for that there are many which are of very good deuise, who in wordes are not able well and readily to epresse it, I woulde wishe him, which in ciuile conuersation seketh to winne fauour and commoditie, that hauing not himselfe learned of Oratours, the places from whence are drawen the varietie and copie of words, figures, and elocution; whereby the speach is bew|tifyed

and set foorth at the least he diligently giue eare to the wordes of others, and thinke with him selfe, that there is not any so fond, or so barren in his speach, but that some|time he saith something worthie of memorie, which ought to gather as a rose amongest thornes, and lay it vp for his owne vse. And albeit these same ornaments and flowers of speache growe vp chiefly in the learned, yet you se that na|ture maketh some of them to florish euen amongst the com|mon sort, vnknowing vnto them: and you shall se artifi|cers, and others of low estate, to apply fitly to their purpose in due time and place, Sentences, pleasant Iestes, Fables, Allegories, Similitudes, Prouerbes, Comptes, and other delightfull speache, varying from the common fourme of talke, whiche hath no small force to content the hearers. And therefore as we haue saide alreadie, it is nedefull to aide our selues with a litle Art. For to set downe thinges alwaies in those bare and simple , which our mother hath taught vs, and to followe euer their plaine propertie, doeth but weary the hearer, who on the contrarie, is recrea|ted and delighted with varietie,  those figuratiue speaches, which are not common to euery one. And though it be more then I nede to doe, to illustre this, which I haue spo|ken with examples, yet (more to satisfie my selfe then you) I will rehearse one. He which in wordes and outward shew pretendeth vs great good will, and in his heart wisheth and worketh vs yll, may be signified, and set foorth by vs with this onely worde (Dissembler) yet you shall heare some fine head (refusing to vse that common worde, whiche very in|fants vnderstande) which will tearme him a wolfe clothed in a shepes skin. Another will say, that in the likenesse of a Doue, he caryeth the taile of a Scorpion: or, that he hath Honie in his mouth, and a Rasor at his girdle. Another will call him a painted Sepulchre, sugred pilles, or gilted copper. Another will say, he maketh shewe of the cuppe, but gi|ueth blowes of the cudgell: or, that he wepeth ouer his Stepmothers graue. Some will crye, beware your legges, or will say, that he offereth you bread with one hand, and

throweth a stone at you with another.


Guaz.
A man may also apply vnto the verse of the Poet

That in the fayrest flowers and grasse,
the serpent most doeth lurke.



Annib.
We may then thereby knowe, that to trimme vp our spech, and to goe an ae beyonde the common sort, it is good to accustome our selues to those pretie and pleasant kinde of speeches.


Guaz.
We must not then blame the diligent industry of some, who like vnto Bes, gather hony of diuers flowers: and not suffering one woord, sentence, or mery iest, spoken by others, to fall to the ground, write them in their tables, to the intent to vse them themselues afterwardes eyther in speaking or writing.


Annib.
I rather commend them, for that it is the way to get reputation with little charge, and I likewise com|mend those, who to store themselues more plentifully, reade comedies and other posies, from which they fetch many thinges to the same effect.


Guaz.
Here it commeth in my head to sell you, that a|boue al (in my iudgeme~t,) they are best liked of in company, to who~ God hath giuen the grace to be able to discourse wel  readily of euery thing. For as the spring time doeth mar|ueylously delight the eies with the sundrie sorts of flowers which it bringeth foorth, so these same by the diuersitie  va|rietie of their discourse, giue woonderful refreshment to our mindes.


Annib.
* I count those, which wil vndertake to speake of euery matter, rather venturous then learned: and I haue knowne some yong men so gredy of knowledge, that they haue deuoured all sortes of bookes without chewing them, and according to the nature of cold stomakes, which desire more then they are able to disgest haue crammed in great abundance of learning, whiche for lacke of good disgestion yeeldeth no nourishment: and while they haue gone about, being amongst learned men to seeme at one time Orators, Poets, Philosophers, and Diuines, they haue scarce shewed

themselues sufficient Gramarians. And therefore you must think, that though they commonly make men haue them in admiration, and take delight in their companie, yet they are confused in themselues, and altogether without order, not vnlike a painters aperne, which you shall see spotted by chaunce with al kinde of coloures. And this their learning, more diuerse then deepe, may in deede (as you say) be like|ned to the flowers of spring time, * for that it is not come to Automne, neither hath gathered the ripe fruites of the right sciences: euery one of which will aske the studie of a mans whole life. So that it is a matter impossible for any man to discourse perfectly of euery thing, and wee may say, that these men follow the Poet in that verse.

I holding nothing fast, of all thinges fasten holde.

Which is likewise agreeable to the Prouerbe, That he is not any where, who is euery where. Yet for my part, I doe not reprehend these men, but rather commend them, as wel for that they haue not aspired hereto without studie, or at least without frequenting the companie of the learned, as also for that * by those their mingle mangles, * they win the liking and good opinion of a great many that they shal come in companie withall *. But I will say thus much vnto you, that is a most commendable course for a prince to take, whom perchaunce it better beseemeth to haue superficiall sight in diuerse languages and sciences, then to be deeplie sene in one onely. For many people of diuerse nations and professions, hauing many important occasions of dealing with him in person, it seemeth meete for his maiestie (not so much for an ornament to himselfe, as vniuersall benifite) to haue of all thinges, if it be possible, a certaine superficiall knowledge. Prouided alwayes, that his principall care and studie be to gouerne and rule his subiects, as he ought to doe: y^t it may not be sayd of him, as of Nero, who was very desi|rous (though he nothing deserued it) to be counted an excel|lent musition: whervpon it was saide that he was euery o|ther thing more then a musition, and yet more a musition then a prince. But for priuate persons, I am flat of this o|pinion,

* that he which seketh to reache the very toppe and type of glory, must rather get him downe to the roote of some one science onely, then gather here and there the fa|ding flowers of many, * remembring alwayes this say|ing: That to unne ouer diuers things slightly, delighteth: but to reade ouer fewe things aduisedly, profiteth.


Guaz.
I perceiue by you, you are desirous to come to other matters: yet I beseche you to clere me of one doubt more touching the tongue, and to shewe me whether you thinke good, that euery one vse the common language of his owne Countrie, or els affect the Tuscane tongue, as the bet|ter and finer.


Annib.
You driue me to speake of a matter, wherein swaruing some what from the opinion of others, I shal per|chaunce purchase to my selfe the tytle of arrogancie: ne|uerthelesse; I consider that the varietie of opinions, whiche haue any grounde of reason, cannot iustly be misliked. And therefore as you shall doe me no wrong to gainesay that which I say vnto you, seing it commeth not from the Ora|cle of Apollo, so I thinke I shal not any way iniurie others, if I nowe frely say vnto you, that I haue alwaies ben of opinion, that euery one speake according to the manner of his owne countrie: which, who so leaueth, to take vp any other fashion of speache, is no lesse to blame then they which renounce, and refuse the Countrie it selfe. For it is to be considered, that after the first confusion of tongues, many sortes of languages haue by the diuine power of GOD remained in the worlde: whereby not onely one Nation was knowne from another, but also one Countrie, one Citie, one Uillage, and (which is more) one strete from another.


Guaz.
I thinke verily that it cannot be saide with rea|son, that I leaue my countrie, but rather that I loue it,  am carefull for it, deseruing to be well thought of of euerie one, if I indeuour in speaking to auoyde the grosse rudenesse of the Montferrat tongue, to reduce and conforme it to the pu|ritie

of the Tuscane tongue, and to stirre vppe others to followe me, so that it may become our owne proper lan|guage.


Annib.
So long as you shall betake your selfe to that manner of speche, and no man els take it vp, your lan|guage shall not merite the name and title of Countrie lan|guage, but rather of forraine, and you shall rather be moc|ked for it, then commended. But if you alone coulde bryng to passe (whiche semeth to me a matter impossi|ble) that the amendment and refourmation by you intro|duced, might be allowed and followed by others, then no doubt but you shoulde deserue commendation of euerie one. For then that language shoulde bee no longer strange, but our owne properly: whereof certaine new fashions in apparrell, taken vp not long since, giue vs an example whiche comming from Spaniardes, and other Strangers, are at this day made our owne by proprietie, whiche falleth out likewise in speche. For not onely this our corrupt language of Montferrat, but euen the Tuscane tongue likewise hath receiued certaine wordes (as you knowe better then I) both French and Peuenciall, and hath so well appropied them, that they are taken for Tuscane. And who knoweth not that by reason of the concourse of the Mantuans hyther, within this little while wee haue giuen course to certaine speches, woordes, and accents come fro~ them, which leaping fro~ mouth to mouth, at length are made common to euery man? Whereby like fishes comming from the ryuer Garda or Mince, they swimme in great abundance into this ryuer. And wee shall se also hereafter, that the diuersitie of people, which is come to place them selues in this Citie, wil, by the mixture of so many tongues, haue chaunged in diuers wordes, the speech vsed at this day.


Guaz.
Then your meaning is, that I ought to speake after the abuse of our countrie.


Annib.
Yea in dede is it.



Guaz.
To what end then haue I bestowed labour in the Tuscane tongue?


Annib.
Mary to this purpose, to set downe well in writing, but your owne minde, and the will and pleasure of the Prince your Maister.


Guaz.
If it bee lawefull for me to write Tuscane like, why shall it not bee lawfull likewise for me to speake Tus|cane like?


Annib.
For that all men commonly delight to write, as men ought to doe, and to speake as men vse to doe: and though they binde them themselues to a right order in wri|ting, yet they are content in speaking to follow the common vsage.


Guaz.
If you did marke, as I haue doone, the de|light whiche these Citizens take to heare Senior Mo|la the President speake the right Tuscane tongue, swe|tened with the pleasant Romane tongue, I am sure, you woulde allowe me and other also to speake the Tuscane tongue.


Annib.
That whiche besemeth him, were vnsemely for you, and in vsing it, you shoulde make your selfe as much misliked, as he is liked. For he hath remained in those partes long time, euen from his youth, where he hath lear|ned the language in suche sorte, that it cannot bee saide, that in his house he speaketh a straunge or affected lan|guage: which woulde be saide of you, who hauing made no abode in those same Countries, you cannot excuse your selfe, that by long vse you cannot speake otherwise: whereby you must thinke that he speaketh so of necessitie, where you shoulde speake vpon pleasure, to content your owne fansie, or els vppon a brauerie, to shewe your skill. And like as it is reported, that while the Astrologer made a discourse of the mouinges of the celestiall Spheres, and couse of the starres, a Philosopher interrupting him, scoffingly demaun|ded of him, how long it was since he came from heauen: so a man might ask you, how long it is since you returned from

Tuscane, and what is the newes of those partes.


Guaz.
Seeing you will not suffer me to speake Tus|cane, but thinke best I shoulde followe our owne countrie language, I will frame my selfe to speake as the common people doeth.


Annib.
So shall you commit a fault vnsemely for so wise a Gentleman as you are, and you shall therein imitate some of our Citizens, who coueting to be counted pleasant fellowes, take delight in counterfaiting to speake clownish|ly, whereof it commeth to passe, that comming afterwardes into the companie of graue persons, they are not able to re|fraine those follies, and so shewe themselues rusticall, and vnciuile in their speach.


Guaz.
If you forbid me both forraine speache, and my owne naturall language also, I knowe not howe I shall speake, me thinkes by you, that you meane to tye my tongue.


Annib.
I doe not prohibite you to speake in your natu|rall and mother tongue, but I woulde not haue you vse im|proper and vnfit speeches.


Guaz.
The more a Tuscane speaketh Tuscane like, shal he not be the more commended?


Annib.
Yes mary shall he.


Guaz.
By the same reason, the more I shall speak Montferrat like, the more praise I shall merite.


Annib.
The same reason cannot hold in things which are vnlike, like as these two tongues are. For the Tuscane is perfect, and ours imperfect: so that of good thinges we ought alwaies to choose the best, and of euill, to leaue the worst.


Guaz.
If I ought to auoide the worst wordes in our tongue, I must be faine to put Tuscane woordes in their stede, which doing, I shall make the hearers to laugh at me, for making suche a mingle mangle of Lombarde and Tuscane woordes togeather. And for my parte, I woulde thinke it better to speake one tongue, altogether

our owne, or altogether Bergamasque, then to speake a language so diuers, and mingled of the Tuscane, and our owne, which ioyned together, haue that grace whiche Dan sheweth, when he saith:
Non credo qui per terra andasse anchoi.


Annib.
I thinke you haue noted thre sortes of gar|mentes, which are vsed at this day, whereof some are of one only colour, like vnto Crowes or Swannes, some of diuers colours, like vnto Pies or Parrets, wherein you se the co|lours deuided, and separated: some are of silke or wooll, of diuers colours, so well incorporated and mingled together, that it is not possible to discerne the one colour from the o|ther, like vnto the feathers of Partridges, or of certain Pi|geons, whose colour is so confused and chaungeable, that a man cannot say what colour they are of. The very same dif|fere~ces are found in speach, for that some vse simple speach, consisting of the tongue only, some compounde of two or thre diuers tongues, some mingled and changeable. And I am of this minde, that this mingled kinde of speach ought to be permitted to most men, that simple kinde to fewe, but that diuers kinde, to none at all. Nowe these onely ought to vse that simple kinde of speach, whose language is per|fect, and polished, and all one in speaking and writing. But those ought to vse the mixed kinde, whose mother tongue is rude and vnperfect, like as ours is. But those erre muche which speake in diuers sorts, vsing sometime wordes which are stark naught,  sometime those which are excellent good, like as Dant did, ending that Tuscane verse before rehear|sed, with a rude worde of Lombardy, which in respect of the other wordes, resembleth a pece of course cloth set vppon a veluet garment.


Guaz.
That Poet is to be excused, for that in his time his tongue was not come to that perfection that nowe it is of.


Annib.
In deede in that respect he is to be excused, and besides, when the necessitie of the ryme did not driue him to it, he vsed oftner Hoggi, then Anchoi. More|ouer,

intreating of high and waightie matters, he bent him selfe rather to profite those which shoulde reade him, then to delight them. And you may well consider that when the minde trauelleth in depe and hard matters, it cannot be cu|rious in the choyse of wordes.


Guaz.
You say well, but I am of this minde, that the making of rime, shoulde not make a Poet vse naughtie wordes.


Annib.
Albeit it be a fault, yet it is muche lesse then that which certaine Poets at this day commit, who take no care howe the sentences hang together, so that the ryme fall right: putting in suche fonde deuises, so farre from the ex|pectation of the discreete Reader, that they make him rea+dier to laugh at them, then to learne them. Like as an ignoraunt Asse some time did, who as your brother tolde the other day in the Academie, ended the first verse of a Sonnet, with this worde Ersiglia, and to rime with that in the fourth verse, he put Vriglia, and in the next fol|lowing Striglia. And lastly, not knowing howe to rime vppe the other quaternarie, he botcht it vp with vna ca|uiglia. Whereby we may gather, that if the faulte in wordes be veniall, the faulte in sentence and matter is mortall.


Guaz.
Seing you neither allowe my simple speche, nor diuers, but will haue me vse only mingled and change|able, it is requisite, if it so please you, that you lay before me the way to myxe this chaungeable language, in suche sort, that the diuision and parting of the colours be not percei|ued.


Annib.
As in changeable silke and cloth, there is euer some one colour that sheweth more liuely then the rest: so to fashion this mixed speche, it is necessary that the natural language be chiefly set foorth, in suche discrete sort as you doe. For you dippe somewhat the Pencill of your tongue in the freshe and clere colour of the Tuscane tongue. Whereby you shadewe the stained spottes of our

mother tongue, mary yet so lightly that your speche is al|wayes knowne for Lombard.


Guaz.
As I remember, there was a Philosopher, who speaking of the myngling, and effectes of diuers co|lours, saith, that by mingling togeather white and black, browne is made: so your meaning is belike, that I speake neither Lombard nor Tuscane, but some hotche potche of both.


Annib.
In making this browne colour, you make your selfe shewe bright: and in confounding these tongues, you shewe your selfe to be of good iudgement. And for that examples explane thinges more plainely, I will tell you that I haue noted how, in this mixture, you haue vt|terly razed these wordes, il moizo la feia la Sgroglia, and other suche like corrupt wordes (whiche are proper not only to some poore labourers of this Countrie, but al|so to some Citizens) and in stede thereof, haue enterli|ned these woordes, Matto, pecora, and guscio. And as it behooueth a Gentleman to speake better then a Plebei|an, so the wisest and best learned Gentleman, ought to speake better then those that are of lesse learning: But alwayes in such sort, that he seme not to set vppe a newe language, and be a stranger in his owne house. And for conclusion, that he haue regarde to this sentence, That he be indued with suche knowledge as the fewest sorte haue attained to, and that he vse suche speache as the most part are accustomed to.


Guaz.
You haue handled this matter, touching speche, verie profoundely, but yet I am not throughly cle|red of one doubt: For whe~ I shal obserue al those things you haue spoken of, I shal easyly make my selfe to be knowne for a Lombard, but it shall be harde to discerne by my speache whether I be of that parte of Lombardie called Montferrat. Whereby that which you haue set downe shall take no place, that euery one ought to manifest by his tongue of what countrie he is, for I may as wel be taken

to be of Plaisance or of Verona, as of this Citie,


Annib.
Your doubt, maketh mee out of doubt, that my discourse touching this matter is not yet finished, and therefore in fewe wordes I answere you, that as by the bookes, apparrell, and behauiour, wee giue a gesse of what Countrie a man is, so the speache ought more manifestly to bewray it.


Guaz.
The Gascons and the Frenchmen are euident|ly enough knowne from others, by their blalsphemie and swearing.


Annib.
The like is vsed almost in all places, but the iust God will vse no difference in punishing vs for it. I would also that not onely in y^e words, but also in the sound, accent, and pronuntiation, we shoulde retaine some signes and markes of our countrie, aswel to shewe our selues such as we are to strangers, as also not to greeue, by a thorowe reformation and diuersitie, our countriemen, with whom we must leade our liues: And therefore reason would we shoulde in some sort shewe our selues agreable to them in speach and manners And for so much as we began this dis|course of the tongue by a similitude of money, we wil end it with the same, and conclude, that as money, by meane of the coine hath a publike stampe set vpon it, whereby it is kno|wen where it was made, so our speach ought to haue a mark vpon it, which may shewe the originall, and countrie of him that speaketh.


Guaz.
You may now if it please you, descende to other things, which this day are to be spoken of.


Annib.
Make account that all which hath ben sayde hythervnto, apperteineth only to the pleasure of the eare,  is but externall, and without. Nowe wee haue to consider more depely, such thinges as are conuenient for education and manners requisite in ciuile conuersation. For Diogi|nes vsed to say, That the Mathematicians behelde the hea|uen and the starres, but saw not that which lay before their fete: and that Orators study to speake wel, but doe it not. Hauing then set down in our ciuil conuersation y^e purity of

spech, we must now co~sider y^t that is not sufficient, without the puritie and sinceritie of manners. And therefore euery one ought to labour, to conforme his minde and affections to his wordes, yea and hauing not the gift of pure spech, he ought to supplie that defect, with the puritie and simplicitie of manners. And therevpon that graunde Captaine Marius, speaking before the people of Rome, sayde, My woordes are not well set in order, but I waygh not that much, so that my dedes be good. Those haue nede of artificiall spech, who with goodly woordes goe about to couer disho|nest dedes.


Guazzo.
Your conclusion in briefe is, that to be ac|ceptable in companie, a man must indeuour to be a Grecian in wordes, and a Romane in dedes.


Annib.
You haue hit my meaning right: but for that I haue already protested, that I will not binde my selfe to search out all the partes of morall Philosophy, we will giue those, that are more studious, leaue to turne ouer the Philo|sophers bookes, to furnish their mindes thorowly with mo|rall precepts, and we will content our selues to speake of things most familiar, and easie to be obserued in con|uersation. Amongst the whiche (to growe nowe to the matter) I woulde wishe euery one that seketh to winne credite in companie, to resolue with him selfe aboue all thinges (whiche very fewe folke doe) to followe that excellent and diuine counsell of Socrates, who being de|maunded which was the readiest way for a man to winne honour and renowme: answered, To indeuour, to bee such a one in deede, as he desireth to seme to bee in shewe.


Guazzo.
If you meane to intreate but of the easiest matters, you must let that alone. For seing there is almost no man that putteth it in execution, it is a signe that it is a very harde point: and you knowe that a very great difficul|tie, and an impossibility, are taken by the lawes for one self thing.


Annib.
Men leaue it not vndone, for want of power

to doe it, or of knowledge howe to doe it, but onely for want of will: and therefore you must not iudge those things hard to be done, which consist onely in our will to doe, or not to doe.


Guaz.
If to be learned, depended so well of my will, as to make a shewe as though I were learned, I woulde perchaunce bee better learned then I seeme to be, for that I shoulde like better to be, than to seme to be: but you knowe, that to attaine to learning, there is not onely requi|red a wil, but study, watching, labour, and disquiet, which are irkesome thinges, so that according to the fashion of o|thers, to hyde my ignorance, I force my selfe to seme that I am not.


Annib.
You knowe that the will is not showen, nor executed of it selfe, but is manifested by the workes that in|sue: which though they be troublesome and ful of labour, yet if the wil be forwarde (if they bee such thinges as may bee done) they become easie to be accomplished. Wherevppon it is commonly sayde, that nothing is hard vnto a willing heart.


Guaz.
I allowe that conclusion for good, but that hate|ful, seming without being, being (as you say) in companie to be auoided, I thinke it nedeful that you shewe the way how we should auoide it.


Annib.
You haue reason to seke howe to eschew this fault, for when we goe about to perswade others, that we knowe that whiche we doe not, wee deceiue not o|thers, but our owne selues and at the length wee are taken tardie in our ignorance. There are then diuers wayes to auoyde it: the first is, that the tongue goe not before the wit. And as women before they present themselues to the view of others, prie in their glasse, and take counsayle and assi|stance therof: so before we vtter our wordes, we must haue recourse to the inward glasse, that we may order and place them in such sorte, that the hearers may not iudge, that they take their beginning rather from the mouth, then from

the heart, and that they are rather shot foorth at all aduen|tures rashly, then vttered with reason aduisedly. Of this premiditation this good shall come, that no man will aduenture to speake of thinges he knoweth not, as the ig|norant commonly doe. For according to the opinion of a wise man, he that speaketh he knoweth not what, play|eth in a manner the parte of a madde man, and falleth in|to the fault that Alexander the great did, who reasoning of painting in the house of Apelles, and vsing speches imper|tinent and contrarie to that art, the wise Painter whispe|red him in the eare, that he shoulde speake no more of that matter, or els that he shoulde speake softly, for that his prentices laught him to scorne.


Guaz.
I allowe wel of this, * wherewith also this say|ing agreeth, That it is no greater prayse to discourse well of that one knoweth, then to be silent in that he knoweth not, * whereof a Poet saide verie well.

Let Sea men speake of windes,
of bees herdes that them keepe:
Let Souldiours talke of war and fight,
and sheepeheardes of their sheepe.



Annib.
It is not long since that a certaine Gentleman (who coueted to be counted learned) chaunced to bee in the company of those that were learned men in dede, where|as there was talke of certaine new and rare workes which were verie shortly to be put in print: he began to speake of an vncle of his deceased, not long before, who, in dede was a man verie well learned: and added further, that at his death he left with him a woorke to be published the good|liest that might be: and being askt whereof it intreated, hee answered, I assure you it intreateth of all the excellent thinges of the worlde, I can not expresse vnto you the great pleasure I take in reading it. But being afterwardes askts whether the woorke were in proase or verse, the poore Gen|tleman without discretion, answered, that hee had forgot|ten that.



Guaz.
You haue produced a pretie example, nowe I pray you shewe mee some other way to auoyde this appa|rence.


Annib.
An other is, not to speake, while an other is in speaking, before the time serue, and before he which speaketh be thorowly vnderstood: for that diuers persons, gredie of this sottishe seming, will not suffer their companion to ende his spech, but interrupting him, and taking the word as it were out of his mouth, will make a shew that they are better learned, and better able to goe thorow with the mat|ter then he, when in verie dede they litle or nothing vnder|stande it. Wherein they resemble those ignorant fooles, who, whiles the Priestes sing at their seruice, ioyne their voices and kepe tune with them, without vnderstanding a|ny thing they say.


Guaz.
This fault is hatefull in company, and offen|deth greatly him which speaketh. Touching this, I remem|ber howe a Gentleman began to rehearse in a certaine com|pany, the order and solemnitie of the mariage of the Duke my maister, whereat he was present: and while hee was speaking, one of the hearers almost at euerie worde woulde put in his speake in the matter, thereby to shewe, that he well vnderstood the whole matter: the Gentleman hauing borne long enough with this vndiscrete dealing, at the length paused a litle, and saide, My maisters, it semeth to me, that this Gentleman knoweth the whole matter bet|ter then I, and therefore I will leaue it to him, thorowly to recount it vnto you. This digression, as you may imagine, made my Gentleman pull in his hornes, and to acknow|ledge his fault, so that without speaking a worde more, he suffered the other Gentleman to go forwarde, and to make an end of his matter.


Annib.
Certaine it is, that wee ought not to interrupt him which speaketh, but rather with a certaine modestie to take sometime that which he saieth, for newes, though eue|rie one knewe it before. But this interrupting of an other, were but a small matter, if a greater inconuenience did not

insue of it. For that he which hath not the patience to giue eare to that which is spoken, oftentimes taketh wordes in other sense then they are spoken. Wherein he resembleth a Dogge, who hearing one knocke at the doore, barketh by and by, before he know whether it be a friend or an enemy, that is there. Wherof arise controuersies without cause, and much confusion, which should not happen if the hearer were more discrete, and woulde attend the end of the mat|ter. So that we may well say, that those which are impati|ent to heare, are rashe to iudge, and are likewise ouerha|stie Iudges: who either by persuasion, or by affection are induced to pronounce sentence, before they heare what ei|ther part can say for them selues.


Guaz.
Uerily, I can not abide how in some companies all will speake together, interrupting one an others talke, and resembling a flocke of Stares, or of Dawes, or other birdes, which when they are lighten on some tre together, make a confused charme and noyse all at once.


Annib.
And you which are discrete, if you chaunce a|mongst suche fellowes, because you will not shew your selfe parciall, are faine to beholde, assoone one, assoone an other, and make a signe with your countenance to all, to shew that you giue eare vnto them.


Guaz.
Without harkening in dede to any one of them.


Annib.
Right, we wil say then, according to the opini|on of a Grecian, that to couet to speake alwayes, and neuer to heare others, is a kinde of tyrannie, so that in talke the speaker and the hearer ought to agre to kepe turnes as it were, like as they doe at tennis. Besides, one that can qui|etly heare an other speake, sheweth howe he liketh to haue the truth euidently and quietly opened in euery matter: and that he can not away with vnaduised and contentious argu|ing. And therevpon it is saide, That to vse silence in time and place, passeth all well speaking: and that it ought to be put in the number of the Philosophicall vertues. For as the Oratour is not knowne but only by speaking, so the Philo|sopher

is no lesse knowne by modest silence, then by his graue sentences. * Therefore I would wish euery one in speaking so to vse the matter, that it may seme he is rather vrged to speake of necessitie, then desirous to doe it volun|tarily. Imitating that wise man, who is commended for thre especiall vertues: the one, that hee neuer tolde lye, the other, that he neuer spoke yll of any, and the third, that hee neuer spoke but vpon necessarie occasion *. Wherevpon I conclude, that in companie euerie one ought to obserue two speciall times to speake: the one, when thinges come in question which hee vnderstandeth perfectly well, and hath at his fingers endes as it were: the other, when such mat|ters arise, as hee must nedes speake of. In these twoo cases, it is better to speake then to bee silent, in all other, hee that shall vse silence shall choose the best way: and auoiding that vaine and counterfeite seeming, shall winne greater commendation.


Guaz.
Neither yet for all that, doe I thinke it meete, for any to be hasty to speake of all thinges that he vnder|standeth and knoweth perfectly, but to goe slowly forwarde in them, and to weigh whether they concerne his calling, or not. For albeit, by reason of my continuall sicklinesse, I haue been driuen to bestowe some time in the studie of Galen, yet for that my cheefe profession is not that way, I shoulde be misliked if I shoulde playe the Phisition a|mongest Phisitions, and enter into any deepe discourse of phisicke.


Annib.
It is no doubt an odious thing for a man to take vppon him sufficiencie, and to be pratling in euery matter. Wherevppon it is sayde that King Cleomenes, as a poore feeble Sophist reasoned in his presence of va|lour and force, fell a laughing, saying, If a Swallow shoulde speake of strength, I shoulde not forbeare laugh|ing, but if an Egle did it, I shoulde hearken to him at|tentiuely. And therefore it were not semely for you to take occasion to speake of Phisicke: and if occasion shal

be giuen you, you may speake of it in way of doubting, or demaunding some question: manifesting by that mode|stie, that you haue more desire to vnderstande that you knowe not, then to vtter that you knowe. Wherefore euerie one ought to consider what opinion other men haue of him, and in what matters they will willingly heare him, and easily giue credite to him, and in no wise to meddle in any other matters.


Guaz.
Haue you any other meanes to shewe vs, wher|by we may flie this fond seming.


Annib.
Marie for that purpose, sinceritie and playne dealing is especially good, a thing verie commendable and necessarie, not only in dedes, but euen in woordes like|wise. For many, to the ende they may be taken for others then they are, vse to shadowe the trueth, and when they thinke to winne credite, in the ende by some meanes or other, they bewray them selues to be lyers and cogging mates, and by their false dealing loose their credite. And though this faulte be committed in diuers sortes, yet me thinkes it is too too intollerable, when a man attribu|teth to him selfe that whiche belongeth to others. Accor|ding to the example of the Flye, whiche sitting vppon a Carte that was driuen on the way, saide, he had raysed a verie great dust: * or like the Emote, who sitting on the horne of an Oxe that was tilling the grounde, beeing askte what he did there, answered, that he went to plough. *


Guaz.
I haue knowne many of them so impudent, that they haue not bene ashamed to affirme them selues to be the Authours of some thinges as newe, and whiche haue befallen to them selues, whiche neuerthelesse are most stale, and founde written a thousande yeeres agoe in other mens workes.



Annib.
Therein they are to bee punished as falsifiers and filchers, for that they appropriate to them selues the ho|nour that is due to others. But they commonly doe pe|nance for this offence, like as once the Dawe did, who she|wing him selfe at a generall muster of Birdes, armed in all pointes with the feathers of an other foule, was at length stripped out of them, and mockt and laught at as a coun|terfaite thefe. We must therefore haue reuerent regarde of the trueth, and take hede that we violate not the virgini|tie thereof in any sort, nor to pull so much as one haire from her, least we sustaine shame thereby. And I will say vnto you more, that the trueth is a thing so tickle, that a man may incurre reprehension not only by disguising it in some parte colourably, but euen by verie reporting of it simply: which is, when men tell thinges which are true, but yet such as fewe will beleue to be true.


Guaz.
Of that danger Dant expresly speaketh in these verses.

It is not good to tell that trueth,
which seemeth like vnto a lie:
For though it be no fault in deede,
yet may a man be blamde thereby.



Annib.
You vnderstande me well, and so you se that in companie we must not only report the trueth plainly and faithfully, but besides, we must be spare in speaking of thinges whiche are not easily beleued. * And therefore it is saide, that Alexander reading certaine verses of a flattering Poet, wherein he was commended for killing of Elephantes, for ouerthrowing of Bulles, and suche like monstrous matters, rebuked him sharpely, forbid|ding him to set foorth any more suche lies, whiche though they were true, yet they woulde be taken for lies. But to auoide this vaine appearance, it is not sufficient for a man to report alwayes the trueth, if he doe not likewise

forbeare to speake of him selfe, and his owne dooings, vn|lesse some necessitie require it. For though he speake ther|of truely and modestly, yet hee leaueth some suspicion of vanitie, and maketh himselfe lesse acceptable in compa|nie: to auoide which inconuenience, let him alwayes haue in minde that saying, that a man ought not to speake of him selfe, eyther in prayse or in disprayse: for that the one is a dede of arrogancie, the other of folly. *


Guaz.
What other wayes do you adde to these already rehearsed?


Annib.
Like as in the night time, the more you fixe your eyes on the firmament, the greater number of starres you discouer, so the more wee consider the sayde sentence of Socrates, the more wayes we finde out to a|uoide this vaine seming, and to be well thought of in companie. Let vs say then againe, that a man ought to indeuour to be suche a one, as he desireth to seme to be, and we shall thereby knowe that as naturally all men desire to be had in honour and estimation, so in the most parte of men, that desire is vaine and foolishe, for that it is not founded vppon any desert, nor any vertue worthy of honour.


Guaz.
You say very true, and I se the abuse so great, that the least worthy, presse most for prayse and ho|nour.


Annib.
Yea but they misse the marke they shoote at, for it commonly falleth out contrarie to their desire? for se|ing others to make no account of them, they beginne to set by them selues, and stirred vp with a foolishe disdaine, they put on a Lyons skin, and looke with a sterne and fierce coun|tenance: By meanes whereof they become hatefull to all men. * But if according to the Philosopher they knew that honour did consist, rather in him which honoureth, then in him which is honoured, they would neuer take vppon them

so bigly, nor set them selues out so arrogantly, knowing that it is not in their power to be honoured of them selues. * Wherefore, who so seketh to be had in reputation, ei|ther for wisedome, iustice, fortitude, or temperance, must examine well him selfe, whether any of these vertues be in him, otherwise his desire can not possiblye take ef|fect.


Guaz.
If none shoulde be had in honour, but men of valour and merite, you shoulde not se men euen of the meanest sorte, greatly estemed of, and fauoured of the peo|ple, only for the good nature and disposition which is noted to be in them, notwithstanding they are voide of learning, and of all those partes, by the aide whereof, men attaine to honour.


Annib.
Those whom you speake of, are rather loued then honoured, and therefore I ment to tell you, that it is not enough for a man to be honoured for some office that he is in, or for vertue that is in him, if hee purchase not also the friendship and good will of other, whiche is the right and sure bond of conuersation: * and in my iudgement, they may be rightly termed their owne enemies whiche labour not by all lawfull and laudable meanes, to heape vp to them selues so riche a treasure.


Guaz.
And howe I pray you is this good will chiefly to be gotten?


Annib.
It is gotten of the absent by reporting well of them behinde their backes, and of the present, by vsing that common meane and instrument, whereby mens hearts are wonne, that is, curtesie and affabilitie.


Guaz.
Out of doubt, there is nothing that maketh vs swarne more from humaine nature, then surlinesse, and it is plainely sene, that these austere countenaunces, and newe Catoes, are hated of all men. And where they count a prayse neuer to laugh, to bende the browes, to frowne, to looke terribly, and to vse rough spech, they

make them selues knowne for proude and discurteous, and with their pride are odious to the proude them selues.


Annib.
I knowe some so haughtie and vnciuill, that they disdaine to salute those whiche salute them, which is a signe of a barbarous minde, to be neither amiable in coun|tenaunce, nor affable in woordes. And though they think they doe a man no wrong thereby, yet it maketh men hate them as enemies.


Guaz.
I can not in any wise abide that sort of men, and I hold rather with those whiche commit this faulte vn|wares, and by ouersight.


Annib.
The fault which is so committed by negligence or ouersight is too grosse, and there is no man that will so interprete it, and therefore they must resolue with them selues either to chaunge their manners, and not to be so scant of their Cappes and salutations, (whiche profite muche without any cost) or els to hire a man of purpose to giue them notice of those whiche shall salute them, that they may remember to salute them againe. For these small trifles being respected, are of force to contract friend|ship, and being neglected, they may dissolue that friend|ship whiche before was contracted. Therefore it is our partes rather to preuent our friendes in salutations, and to goe beyond them in curtesie.


Guaz.
There was a King of Fraunce, who as a com|mon strumpet did reuerence to him in the strete, did re|salute her curteously, and as one saide vnto him, that his maiestie had done honour to a woman voide of honestie, that did not deserue it: he answered, that he had rather erre in saluting some that are naught, then to faile at a|ny time to salute any that are good.


An.
A saying truly fit for a king, wherby appereth y^t he that

doeth looke to finde curtesie, must like to shewe curtesie in what sorte soeuer it bee, and he must alwayes remember, that neyther harde Wine is pleasaunte to the taste, nei|ther haughtie behauiour acceptable in companie: whiche agreeth with the letters of Philip, King of Macedon: wherein is plainely shewed, that gentle and curteous speche, is the Adamant stone whiche draweth vnto it the heartes and good willes of all men.
And albeit it be so, that this vertue be semely and commendable in all sortes of people, yet it shineth most brightly in those whiche are our Superiours, either in power or preeminence, when you receiue of them cur|teous speches, in suche sorte, that what by their gentle woordes, and what by their liuely lookes and cherefull countenaunce, you vnderstande their affections, wheretoo your will doeth easily incline. I coulde here alledge vn|to you, the example of two brothers, Gentlemen of great calling, whereof the one for his gentle speche and plea|saunt lookes, is greatly beloued of euerie one, and the other for his terrible countenaunce, and stately kinde of talke, is fauoured but of a fewe: In so muche, that some whiche fall in talke of them, say, * that if they were to request any thing at their handes, they shoulde remaine more pleasauntly satisfied with a deniall of the first, then with a graunt of the other.


Guaz.
Therevppon it is saide, that a man doeth one parte of the good turne, when hee gratiouslye denyeth it. *


Annib.
But notwithstanding I commende this low|lye and gentle behauiour, yet woulde I haue euery one kepe that maiestie and state whiche is due to his estate. For to be too populer and plausible, were to make lar|gesse of the treasures of his curtesie, to abase him selfe, and to shew a signe of folly or flatterie. Wherby a man against his will may shew himselfe sometime to be that he is not,  giue

occasion to others to insult ouer him, and not to respect him so muche as they ought to doe. But I would wish men, so muche as is possible, to shewe at once the maiestie of a Philosopher in the grauitie of sentences, and the humili|tie of a Christian in the gentlenesse of woordes: hauing in minde, that curteous language multiplieth friendes, and mitigateth enemies, and that according to the prouerbe, The meke Lambe sucketh the teates of his owne damme and of others also.


Guaz.
I remember I haue read a sentence, not muche different from that, to wit, that he which speaketh gen|telly to his neighbour, receiueth of him a gentle answere, and out of the breastes where he searched milke, bringeth out butter.


Annib.
* Assure your selfe it is euen so. But to be sure to reape this commoditie, it is requisite that this gentle speche come from the heart, and that it be not intermin|gled with some fonde iesture and behauiour, whiche may make it smell of flatterie, and in stede of loue, purchase hate. Like as some doe, who by their continuall girning and shewing of their tethe, make men doubt whether they honour them, or laugh at them.


Guaz.
It is a common saying, that to smile vpon eue|rie man, is rather a signe of a vayne minde, then of a chere|full countenance.


Annib.
Nowe I will ioyne for a sister and compani|on to affabilitie, an other vertue, verie necessarie in Con|uersation, and it is that, whiche not only with gentle woordes, but with a certaine wittie and readie pleasant|nesse delighteth wonderfully the hearers. And as that is a signe of curtesie, so this is a token of wit, and is vsed no lesse in iesting merily with others, then in ta|king iest patiently of others. There are diuers sortes of this pleasauntnesse, wherevppon both the Philoso|phers and Rhetoritians, seing howe auaileable it is to re|freshe mindes ouercharged with melancholy and pensiue

thoughtes, howe acceptable in companie, and howe con|ducible to health, haue at large taught vs diuers wayes howe to attaine vnto it.


Guaz.
I beleue well that arte and studie may helpe something in it, but in my iudgement, it is nature that must woorke chiefely. Whiche to be true, appeareth by many men of great wisedome and learning, who in a pleasaunt matter haue no grace at all, and contrariwise, many ignorant men, euen of the common sorte, will han|dle a pleasaunt matter so finely, that they will make He|raclitus him selfe laugh at it.


Annib.
I graunt vnto you, that according to the di|uersitie of natures, the actions of men are diuers, and that it is harde for one to mooue delight in others, with|out a certaine naturall liuelinesse of spirite. But it is seldome sene that a man pleasauntly conceited, is not al|so sharpely witted. Which Gonella noteth, saying, That to playe the foole well, it behooueth a man first to be wise. But notwithstanding I am of opinion, that a man solemne by nature, may by vse get the habite of pleasauntnesse, and I am sure you will not denie me, but that there are some in countenaunce and iesture verie graue and seuere, who in companie are pleasaunt and merie beyonde all measure. But it is better for a man not to alter his owne nature from grauitie, then to vse mirth immo|destlye. For as the meane is commendable, so the extreames are detestable, and growe either to scurrilitie in vsing too licentious scoffing, or els to inciuilitie, in refu|sing all merie iesting. *


Guaz.
Nowe for so muche as you haue shewen howe pleasauntnesse in companie delighteth, and howe gentle|nesse in speche maketh vs appeare what we are, and discouereth the affections of our friendly heartes, where|by we winne the good will of others, I woulde gladly knowe of you, if there be any other way besides, whiche will worke such laudable effectes.



Annib.
Albeit by affabilitie, onlye there is imprin|ted in mens heartes a good opinion of vs, euen lyke as is in the waxe by the Seale or Signet, yet we must put too somewhat els, whereby that print and impressi|on may bee made to continue: whereto is verie it and auayleable the vertue called modestie, or rather that which we commonly call discretion.


Guaz.
And wherein is that vertue to be vsed?


Annib.
In euerie thing, but chiefely in finding fault with others mens faultes. And therefore it is to bee presupposed that GOD hath made man a companable creature, that by meanes of Conuersation, he may both assist others, and be assisted him selfe, as nede shall re|quire. Wherfore seing no man on earth is indued with ab|solute perfection, wee must not mocke at other mens imper|fections, least others likewise laugh at ours.


Guaz.
You say verie true, but doe you not knowe, that (as the Prouerbe is) we se better a farre of, then hard by vs, and that at home we se no more then Moles, but abroade as muche as Argus, * and that we can spie a moate in anothers eye, and not a beame in our own? * But wherof thinke you, this fault procedeth?


Annib.
Perchaunce of selfeloue, which suffereth not a man to se his imperfections.


Guaz.
But me thinkes suche a one semeth to loue others better then him selfe, for that hee leaueth to cor|rect his owne faultes, to amende other mens.


Annib.
Hee shoulde in verie dede loue others bet|ter then him selfe, if hee were mooued to seke the amend|ment of other mens manners vppon charitie and loue: but it is knowne too well, that he is stirred to it of a cer|taine presumption and desire to seme more wise then o|thers, wherevppon I thinke the verie occasion why we are so busie to finde faultes in others, is, that contrarie

to the foresaide saying of Socrates) we take more pleasure to seme then to be: and we thinke we shewe not such wit in amending our owne faultes, as in reprehending other mens. But all those which will be such as they desire to seme, will be seuere reformers of them selues, and they wil sooner spye their owne faultes then others.


Guaz.
I woulde gladly haue you shewe particulerly which are the faultes of others, wherein this discretion is to be vsed.


Annib.
There are two sortes of faults, the one, of those which are not full ripe, the other, of those whiche are tho|rowe rotten. I call the vnrype ones, those whiche one is readie to commit, and the rype ones, those whiche are alreadie committed. We must staye the committing of the first so muche as we may, for the other, some are to be excused, some to bee blamed. If then we perceiue a|ny in reasoning, to bee driuen into so narowe a straite, that he can not easily get out of it, without committing some absurditie either in wordes or in matter, it shall be our parte discretely to preuent him. And (as one that stum|bling at a stone is readie to fall downe) readily to take holde of him and staye him vp: not staying till hee fall, to make the companie fall a laughing, and him selfe to be ashamed. In dooing whereof, we assure him, which spea|keth, of the good account we make of him, and giue him to vnderstande howe iealous we are of his honour, in suche sort, that we make him thereby verie friendly affectioned towardes vs: whereas on the contrarie, there is nothing that setteth him sooner in a rage, and maketh him to alie|nate his good will from vs, then to thinke him selfe had in contempt, and to be flouted at.


Guaz.
This contempt in my opinion is intollerable: for that there is no man that thinketh so vilely and abiectly of himselfe, that he deserueth to be scorned. And in my o|pinion, besides that, it is no good manner to mocke another, he is also in daunger to receiue the like, or a greater mocke himselfe: For suche a blowe as the Asse giueth against the

wall, suche a one he receiueth him selfe. And if it be a fault to floute such as one knoweth, it is a greater fault to deride those he knoweth not, whiche some rashe and insolent fellowes vse to doe, who (as the saying is) iudging the hor|ses by the sadles and furnyture, * consider not that oft times vnder a clownishe coate, is hidden a noble and liuely vnderstanding.


Annib.
A poore Peisant of Montferrat, may be a proofe thereof, who comming into the Citie, accompanied with cer|taine women, a saucie Citizen saide vnto him, Thou hast vndertaken to bring a great many Goates to our market: Syr (answered he) me thinkes I haue brought but a few, in respect of the great number of Buckes which is there.


Guaz.
I knowe a young man, who by his iesture and lookes semeth to be but a foole, and for that cause some make them selues merry at him, but I may say to you, he can frame his answeres so fitly, and can giue quip for quip so wittily, that those which begin the skirmish with him bold|ly, are faine to retyre shamefully.


Annib.
To conclude, it is a perilous thing to mock and scoffe at others, and, as the saying is, To anger a Waspe: And therefore it is not good to mocke any man in any maner of wyse. For if he be our better, or equall, he will by no meanes abide that we shoulde abiectly esteme of him. If he be our inferiour, we make him thereby to withdrawe his good wil from vs, which is an yll matter: For we ought to indeuour to make euery one (if it be possible) friendly af|fectioned towards vs. Now if it fall out that another ouer|shoote himselfe in talke, we must consider whether it pro|cede of vnskilfull foolishnesse, or of wilfull naughtinesse, for the first, we ought to excuse it, or discretely to seke to hyde it, without iesting at it, as some scoffing merchantes, which are altogether voide of wit, vse to doe: for as it is an yl thing to make a scoffe at that which is well done, so is it a cruell and odious thing to scoffe at that which is yll done by igno|rance or ouersight. But let vs come to those faultes whiche procede of vice, and which are to be reprehended.



Guaz.
I thinke there is nede of farre more discretion in reprehending those, then in the other.


Annib.
So muche the more, by howe muche the more daunger it is too deale in good earnest then in iest. And though it bee meete for all sortes of men to excuse or couer those light faultes beefore spoken of, in all sortes of men, yet is it not lawfull for euery one to correct and reprehende the imperfections and faultes of euery man. As it is not lawfull for euerie one either for lacke of authorite (as for a young man too reprehende an olde, or for one of lowe estate, one that is of highe calling) or else for that hee is sprinckled with the like or with greater imperfections (as for an adulterer, to re|buke another for lasciuiousnesse,) or for lying. For as the Prouerbe is,
Hee that mocketh the lame, must take heede that hee him selfe goe vpright. Likewise we ought not to presume to correct any others, but those, with whom ei|ther by consanguinitie, or by long familiaritie, we haue credite and authoritie. To be briefe, in reprehending, we must not onely haue respect to the qualitie of the per|sons, but also of the places and times, and to consider both howe we ought to vse reprehension, and howe our friend is disposed to receiue it. And therefore it is reported that one saying to another. Art thou not ashamed to be drun|ken in such sort? He answered, Art not thou ashamed to reprehende one that is drunke? In like case it were to no purpose, but woulde rather make him worse, to rebuke a swearer, while hee is in his rage, and in the presence of o|thers. Yet this aduertisement is not enough, but to vse deper discretion in the matter, we must vse an honest kinde of deceite, and intermingle with the bitternesse of reprehension, the swetenesse of some prayse. Or wee muste blame others for those faultes whiche are in him whom wee seeke to refourme: or els reproue our selues as subiect too suche imperfections. Finally,

we ought to reprooue our friende in suche sorte, that hee maye take it well, and thinke him selfe beehol|ding too vs for it. As some Philosophers in their Morall woorkes haue taughte vs to doo, whiche shall suffice touching this pointe. Nowe touching other meanes pertayning to the obseruation of the sentence beefore set downe, if wee looke thorowely intoo it, wee shall finde that all those, whiche loue rather too be, then to seeme to bee, will vse that foresaide discre|tion in auoyding all quarrellous contentions and ob|stinate arguyng in matters, whereby a man, desirous of that vayne seeming, will often times, contrarye to all reason, seeke to seeme to haue the vpper hande of o|thers.


Guaz.
In my opinion, there is nothing that maketh a manne woorse liked of in companie then that.


Annib.
And therefore if hee which speaketh, saye the trueth, wee ought too contente our selues so well with his woordes, as if they were holy Scrip|ture: And if hee chaunce too vtter any vntrueth, ra|ther then too stande in contention with him (so that it no way preiudice vs) we ought modestlye too beare with it: Obseruing alwayes the rule of Epictere, who sayd that in companie wee must yeelde humbly too our Su|periour, perswade gently with our inferiour, and a|gree quietly with our equall. And by that meanes there shall neuer bee any falling out.
Nowe I meane too tell you howe a manne ought too behaue him selfe in such ceremonies as are requisite in companie.


Guaz.
I should thinke it wisedome to vse no ceremonies at all in companie, for so much as they procede rather of cu|rious vanitie, then of faythfull affection: and in my iudge|ment the more a man vseth them, the lesse plaine dealing is thought to be in him. Wheras on the contrary, when you

se one goe plainely to woorke both in woordes and iesture, you say by and by, that he is a good honest meaning man. For my part I weigh it little, that my equall, hauing the wall of me, should goe from it to giue me place: I had rather haue him beare me more goodwill, and doe me lesse honour. And as you cannot but laugh to se a farre off a number of folke, skipping, leaping,  daunsing, you hearing no sowne of instrument: so it must nedes make you merry, to se a farre two persons vse diuerse iestures and ceremonies of the head, the handes, the knes, and wrying their whole bodie, not hea|ring any woorde they say. I will not say vnto you, that for one which hath a good grace in these ceremonies, there are a thousand whom it be commeth so ill to vse them, that it will make you sicke at the heart to se it: and you shall see some of them goe so vntowardly to woorke, that coueting to bee courtlike, they become plaine cartlike. As I haue sene some talking with the Duke my maister, and seing him bare headed, haue taken his arme with both their handes, and made him put on his hat.


Annib.
He should haue put it of againe, to haue shew|ed that he was not bare in respect of them, but because of the heate.


Guaz.
But there was another behaued himselfe some|what better, who talking with the Duke being vncouered, tooke his cap foorth of his hand, and put it vppon his head. So that I say againe, that I can in no way away with these ceremonies, which are no lesse vnseemely in worldly mat|ters, then they are conuenient in sacred and diuine thinges.


Annib.
I se not how those thinges can dislike you, which commonly like all men.


Guaz.
I thinke you mistake, for I know many, who professe them selues mortall enemies to those ceremo|nies.


Annib.
Those same (and beleeue me) openly detest them, but secretly desire them: and if you well consider the matter thorowly with your selfe, you shall knowe that ce|remonies displease no bodie. For this is certaine, that they

are doone in signe of honour, and there is not he, who is not glad with all his hearte to bee honoured, and who ought not to be glad to honour another, for so muche as (accor|ding to the saying of the Philosopher) he whiche honou|reth, receiueth more honour, then hee whiche is honoured, for like vnto the Sunne, the beames of honour by reflexion, as it were, doe shine backe againe vppon him. And as he whiche is ceremonious may be thought to be a dissembler, so he whiche is not so, may be taken to be a clowne, a ru|desby, or a contemner of others. I will not say that they doe yll whiche pray you to vse no ceremonies in respect of them, but I rather commende them: For their very say|ing so, is a certaine kinde of Ceremonie and behauiour, whereby they goe about to couer their ambition, and it is according to the fashion of Phisitions, who for manner sake sometime refuse money with their mouth, but take it with their hearte, and finger it with their handes. And as the sacred Ceremonies, which are veide of superstition, are not displeasant in Gods sight, and stirre vp to deuotion the mindes of the ignorant people, whiche are not come to the perfect knoweledge of Gods worde: so these worldly ce|remonies purchase vs the good will of our friendes and su|periours, to whom they are addressed, and make vs knowne for ciuile people, and from rude countrie loutes.


Guaz.
Howe then must we behaue our selues in Ce|remonies?


Annib.
Mary in such sort, that he which vseth them, be|wray thereby the affection of his heart, that the inward loue may be knowne, as well as the outwarde honour is sene, otherwise ceremonies are lothsome vnto vs, and shew that the hearte is faigned. And on the other side, it is the parte of him whiche receiueth these outwarde honours, first, modestly to refuse them, shewing thereby that he looketh not for them, otherwise he shall shewe to be somewhat proude, which is most hurtful in conuersation: And besides, you knowe well that your equall doth honour vnto you, ra|ther of curtesie, then of dutie, and when you shal accept those

honours as due vnto you, and as of your inferiour, you shall make him care but a little what reuerence he sheweth vnto you. To be short, we must receiue honour at our friends handes, rather as offered by them, then looked for by vs: and it is not amisse to follow the example of that discrete gentle|man, who, after long strife betwene him and certaine of his friendes, who should first enter into the house, saith, You may nowe knowe well howe muche I am at your com|maunde, seing I am ready to obey you in thinges which turn to my dishonor: which said, he entred in without stray|ning curtesie any longer.


Guaz.
I allowe the reasons alleadged by you to main|taine Ceremonies, but I will say vnto you, that they ought to be obserued rather amongest strangers, then familiar friendes. For if I be not deceiued, true friendship can a|way neither with Ceremonious wordes nor dedes.


Annib.
I am in dede of your minde, that from true friendship, Ceremonies shoulde be taken. But where at this day are those true friendes to bee found? Know you not that according to the Philosopher, Perfect friendshippe extendeth not towardes diuers persons, but is restrained to the loue of one alone? I knowe not who is your assured friende, but I am sure that I haue not yet founde mine, with whom I might vse suche open, simple, and fre beha|uiour as you meane. For you must thinke it a harde mat|ter to finde in the worlde two heartes which loue perfect|ly. And though in token of true friendship, you call your companion brother, perchaunce hee shall haue no minde to tearme you so: and to take that custome from you, he wyll call you Maister Guazzo. And that you may not vse too familiar speche to him, he will speake to your worship in suche sorte, that you shall be faine to retyre one steppe backe, and vse him rather Ceremoniously then louingly. Of this common course of the world I gather, that those with whom wee are conuersaunt, being rather well willers, then true friendes, it is our partes to take

hede of too broade and to familiar behauiour with them, whereby we may hazzarde to loose their good will and to followe the example of Flies, which will not become tame amongst vs, though they dayly dwell with vs,  eate of our cates when we doe.


Guaz.
I remaine satisfied of all that you haue spo|ken. Nowe I consider with my selfe that this your dis|course comprehendeth generall matters, and agreth to all sortes of persons. And therefore I woulde bee glad that you shoulde declare particularly the meanes that euery one ought to obserue, according to his estate and calling.


Annib.
Wee haue already saide, that it is a matter im|possible to set downe particularly, what euery one ought to doe in companie, and therefore it shall suffice only to con|sider, that the thinges afore spoken, ought to be common to all, like as the stretes, the Churches, the Fountaines, and common Conduites are. But as euery one indeuoureth to get and appropriate to him, either house, landes, or moue|ables, in like sort, euery one in his order of life and conuer|sation, ought to propose vnto him selfe speciall lawes, and suche a kinde of behauiour as shall be conuenient to his calling. But to reape the right fruite of conuersation, whiche consisteth chiefly in the good will of others, it is ne|cessary, that we knowe and learne not onely what belon|geth to our selues, but also howe to behaue our selues to|wardes others, according to the difference of their estates, for that it is our hap to come in companie, somtime with the young, sometime with the olde, assoone with Gentlemen, assoone with the baser sorte, nowe and then with Princes, nowe and then with priuate persons, one while with the learned, another while with the ignoraunt, nowe with our owne Countriemen, then with strangers, nowe with the religious, then with the secular, nowe with men, then with women.


Guaz.
I se nowe well you shoulde enter into a Laberinth, out of which you shoulde not get a long

time, if you woulde discourse particularly of all these points.


Annib.
Thinke hardily that euerie one of these points will aske a whole dayes discourse.


Guaz.
Seing you are so desirous to rydde your selfe of this matter in so short time, you doe as those whiche runne poste, who, desirous to go much ground, do not view, but only trauers the Countries.


Annib.
I say then (as it were in passing by) that there are fewe to be founde, whiche are not sicke of some of those diseases, whiche we haue before mentioned, but the extre|mest sicke of all, are young men: For whose health it is requisite, that they shaue of from their face that counterfeite bearde, I meane that false seeming and vaine perswasion: remembring the~selues, that as their faces are smooth  bare without hear, so their heades are barren of vnderstanding. For if it be true, that length of time bringeth experience, and that wisedome groweth of experience: it is moste true, that young men for lacke of yeres and experience cannot be wise: And thereof commeth the Prouerbe, That the Diuell is full of knowledge, because hee is olde. And therefore they ought to bridle their ouer rashe tongues,  to vse chiefly silence in stede of medicine, imprinting in their heartes this saying, That a young man shoulde hardly speake in his owne cause, though he bee in a manner vrged vnto it.


Guaz.
It is a common saying, that a young man is to be blamed, which will talke like an olde man, and a wo|man which will speake like a man.


Annib.
Young men ought chiefely to kepe this si|lence when they are amongest olde men, whose companie is maruellous auayleable vnto them.


Guaz.
It is so much behoofull to them, as it is for the most part hatefull to them, by reason of the diuersitie of complexions, fancies, and conditions, so that they flye from it so much as possibly they may, that they may inioy the

companie of their equals.


Annib.
Men ought to conceiue so much the better opi|nion of those young men, which willingly associate them|selues with old men, for that they seme to preue~t age, with vertue: and beginning by time to be wise, they continewe so a long time. Whereof it commeth, that easily, and before the tyme, as it were, with the good report they haue wonne, and the good deedes they haue done, they come to honour and pre|ferment. And therefore in my opinion, those young men which eschue the companie of old, hyde their woundes, and make them to fester inwardly. And contrariwyse, those which followe it, lay open their imperfections, and thereby receiue guerison.


Guaz.
It is much better to acknowledge our im|perfections in our youth, then in our age, for as the Poet sayth,
In youth to doe amisse, it is the lesse reproche.


Annib.
There is no doubt of it, but that young folke learne of old, by reason of their authoritie and wisedome, to moderate their burning desires, to acknowledge their wa|uering inconstancie, and to correct their other naturall im|perfections. And as, hauing occasion of farre trauayle into vnknowen Countries, we addresse our selues to some one whiche knoweth the way to giue vs certaine in|structions of it: so likewise in this pilgrimage we haue to make in this doutfull and deceitful life, wee can not doe bet|ter, then to be informed of those which haue happily, as it were, reached to their iournies ende, to knowe what wayes we ought to forsake, and what to take to come safely to the ende of our voyage: whiche is most daungerous to young folke, as the wiseman sayth, who, to the vncertaine flight of the Egle in the ayre, of the ship on the sea, and of the ser|pent on the rocke, addeth, as most vncertaine, the way of a yong man in his first yeres. Yong men therfore are to folow the companie of olde, and to make their account, that hee which frequenteth the wise, becommeth wise, and to imitate the youth of Rome, which had age in such reuerence, that e|uery

one did honour to his elder, as to his parent. And con|trariwise it was counted a thing worthy punishement, if a yong man did no reuerence to an olde, or a childe to one at mans state. * Yea in some Countries, it is not lawe|full for a young man to beare witnesse against his el|der. * And in truethe it is reasonable that eche one make reuerent account of those whiche doe surmount them in age and vnderstanding. And as they se their youngers ho|nour them in respect that they are more auncient, so moo|ued by that example, they ought to reuerence those whiche are their elders. But after other medicines mete for young mens health, I will for conclusion adde this, that as hee ought to auoyde bolde presumption, so hee ought in companie to be indued with suche a modest shame|fastnesse, that his chekes may nowe and then be dyed with Uermilion, whiche will become him, and is a to|ken of a good nature, and a signe that he wil come to good|nesse.


Guaz.
I coulde neuer lyke of a young man that is im|pudent. For besides that he is ill thought of, in that he wan|teth the vertue of modestie, whiche hee ought to bee indued withal, it semeth to prognosticate that he wil come to some ill end.


Annib.
I thinke we haue spoken sufficiently of yong folke, so that I thinke good that we turne our eyes from the East to the West, and consider what belongeth to old folke: euen in whom there breake forth many maladies, as wel of mind as of body.


Guaz.
I know not how you can heale those old festred soares which are so hard to be cured.


Annib.
Olde soares are in dede hardly healed, but al soares are not festred in old folke. I count those old  festred which haue taken depe rootes, and which began to growe e|uen from youth forward, but those I count not old which old age for the most part bringeth with it. As to be seuere, chur|lish, couetous, whining. c. Which are diseases wherof some old folke may be cured, by giuing place to reason.



Guaz.
Albeit perchaunce they may be cured of those diseases, yet in my fancy it is not well done to goe about it. But it is better rather to followe their humour, like as we doe to those whiche are past recouerie, in euery thing which they demaunde, following the common saying, that wee must not adde affliction to the afflicted.


Annib.
The right olde men (to wit the wise) the ne|rer they approch to their ende, the more delight they take in knowledge and vertue. Touching this, I would haue you call to minde the saying of him, whiche sayde that if he had one foote within the graue, yet hee woulde still be learning somewhat. For that he was not ignorant that the things whiche wee knowe, are but the least part of the things we knowe not. Yea we may say, that a man neuer begin|neth to knowe, vntil by age we drawe towardes the ende of our life. Which a certaine philosopher sheweth very wel, who with lamentation complaineth of nature, for giuing a very long life to many reasonles creatures, vsing great libe|ralitie towards them,  dealing very hardly with man, who is depriued of life, then when he beginneth to liue, that is, to vnderstand, and then when hee ought to inioy the fruites of his labours. But I meane not here to discourse vnto olde folke, what is requisite for them to sustaine the burthen of age, and to arriue safely at the hauen and ende of misery and sorrowe: For that were to perswade my selfe foolishly that Cato had not spoken of that matter largely and elo|quently. But I wil say vnto you, that many olde folke com|plaine without cause, that their age is smally regarded or reuerenced, and perswade themselues, for that they haue a whyte beard, for that they are bald, bleareyed, toothlesse, crooked, trembling, and sickly, that therfore al honor shoulde be due vnto them, and many of them se not how voide they are of vnderstanding, vertue, and wisedome. And therefore they ought to consider, that olde age is not to be respected or reuerenced for the number of their yeres, but chiefly for the merite of their good conditions and Uertue: and therevppon it is sayde, that to be

hoare heared, is a signe of yeres, not of knowledge. And if I may say, that an old man without knowledge and vertue, is worthy no honour at all, for that it is a signe hee hath spent his youth in nothing that is commendable. Whiche is confirmed by this saying, that thre sortes of men are odious to the world, a poore man proude, a riche man a lyar, and an old man a foole. Now touching conuersation, I woulde ad|uise old men to temper alwayes their falke with grauitie and wisedom, and for the most part to speake of those things which serue for example and instruction of life.


Guaz.
No doubt, it is alwayes the vse to attribute much to old age, and their words are euer of more force then yong mens.


Annib.
Thereof it commeth, that as yong men being asked their age, make themselues yonger then they are, to conserue the ornament of youth, and to make others thinke they haue that force and sufficiency in them, which is inci|dent to youth: so likewise old men alwayes make the~ selues older then they are, to inioy the preheminence and authority which is giuen to age. *


Guazzo.
This is very true for the most part, yet now and then we se some olde doating fooles, who notwithstan|ding they fele their legges feble and trembling vnder the~. and se in their glasse their whyte heares, whiche exhorte them to change of life, and manners, yet for all that they wil not yelde themselues, but will take vppon them to play the souldiours, and the louers, little esteming that saying, that
It is not meete for age,
to sue the slippery traine:
Of Venus or of Mars both, which
pay labour but with paine.
So that they will not onely not confesse their age, but make themselues yonger then they are.


Annib.
Those whom you speake of are very offensiue, for that by their euil example they imbolden young men to doe ill. And therefore I account him to be of great wisedome

which can conforme his ma~ners to his age, hauing an eye to the saying of the Apostle, when I was a childe I spoke like child, but being man growen, I cast away al childish tricks. But you say nothing of those, who not content to yeelde to the course of nature, desire to seeme young, and goe another way to woorke to hide their age, that is, by pulling of their white heares, or else seeking to conuert their siluer heares into golden ones, the simple soules not perceiuing that this their transformation or rather deformation is no more seene then a nose in a mans face.


Guaz.
There was one olde graybeard, who perceiued this well ynough, but too late and with repentance. For hauing been denied a suite which hee craued at his princes handes, he went and dyed his bearde and his head, and per|swading himselfe he should not be knowne, returned twoo dayes after to the prince, preferring his former suite, who spying his crafte, making as though he perceiued it not, an|swered him, I cannot with mine honour graunt it to you; for that I haue alredie denied it to your father, who, two dayes since requested the same thing at my handes.


Annib.
Let vs nowe make an ende of this matter, ad|uising olde men to suffer their minde to waxe olde together with their bodie, and not to behaue themselues youthfully in their age: and when they are ariued to their ende, not to seeke to turne backe, but rather to giue themselues to consi|der that age naturally maketh them crooked and stooping towardes the grounde, to the ende they may thinke to re|turne from whence they came, and to remember that at that time their breath euen hangeth at their lippes. * They haue further to take heede, least they contemne young folke (a fault common to many of them) for it is their parte too make account of them, and to vse great discretion in their behauiour towardes them, to the ende, that young folke (if for nothing else) may therby be mooued to doe them ho|nour: otherwise they may assure themselues they shall bee had in contempt and derision. They must bee sure (being

amongest youth to vse great respect as well in wordes as estures, remembring that the intemperancie of olde men maketh young men more disordered and dissolute. * And to conclude, that they haue regarde to the commaundement of Paule, that they be sober, chast, wise, sound in faith, in charitie, and in patience, which vertues will make them acceptable to all honest companies. * But nowe let vs speake of Gentlemen and yeomen, betwene whom by reason of their difference and inequalitie, there are diuers thinges to be obserued in company.


Guaz.
I thinke that labour lost, or at least a thing not woorthie your labour to goe about to instruct the base peo|ple, about whom, being by nature vnciuill, rude, vnto|warde, discurteous, rough, sauage, as it were, barbarous, and voide of vnderstanding, you shall loose your labour, and according to the Prouerbe, both water and soape.


Annib.
If you meane by those of base birth, only la|bourers and rustikes, our speche in dede woulde be spent in vaine: but if you consider the infinite number of persons which reache not to the degre of Gentlemen, and yet are not from it, you will not deny but that both for the good minde they carie with them, and the good calling they liue in, they are woorthie some place in company, and that they ought to be put in the middest betwene Gentlemen and clownes. And truely I knowe many men of means cal|ling, who in Gentlemanlike and curteous conditions, in good bringing vp, and all their talke and behauiour, excell many Gentlemen. And contrariwise, I am sure you know many Gentlemen more vnciuill then the Clownes them|selues.


Guaz.
If they be vnciuill, howe are they Gentlemen? And if they be Gentlemen, howe are they vnciuill? I pray you euen at once vndoe me the knot of this gentry, which I see to be verie intricate by reason of the diuersitie of opinions which are about it, and so consequently you shall come to set foorth manifestly the Conuersation betwene gentlemen

and yeomen.


Annib.
Hauing this day to speake of many thinges and being alredie late, I cannot fully satisfie your request. For I shoulde be driuen to stay heare long time to bring in all that, which many authors haue at large written of it, es|specially that great Tiraquel one of the kinges counsellours in the Paliament at Paris, yet somewhat to followe your minde, and not much to hinder our course, I say vnto you (as it were in passing by) that some falling to define gentry, haue sayde it be the dignitie of the fathers and auncestours, others the auncient patrimonie, others riches ioyned with vertue, others vertue onely. Besides that the woor|thie maister George Carretto an Academike alleaged the o|ther day in his discourse the authoritie of Balde who ma|keth three sortes of gentrie, the first in respect of blood, as the common sorte vnderstandeth it: the other in respect of good conditions, as the Philosopher taketh it: the thirde in respecte of both, and that I call true gentrie.


Guaz.
There might be added here that other sorte of gentrie, which is gotten by the Priuiledge of Prin|ces.


Annib.
Perchaunce he ioyned that with the Philo|sophers gentrie. For it may be sayde that the prince by that priueledge doeth approoue the vertue and merites of him he rayseth to the state of gentrie. But the excellencie of gentry hath ben much more restrained by Diogenes, who being asked, who were the best Gentlemen, answered, those which set naught by riches, honours, pleasures, and life, and which ouercame their contraries, to wit, pouertie, ignominie, payne, and death.


Guaz.
I thinke the race of such Gentlemen is at this day extinguished.


Anniball.
Nowe for that there are many di|stinctions of gentry according the diuersitie of opinions, albeeit some Philosophers assigne foure sortes and some fiue, I will bee so holde deuising familiarly with you, to make yet one sorte more according to myne owne

fancie, though I swarne a little from their opinion. There are then thre sortes of gentry, whereof I deriue thre sortes of Gentlemen, to witte: Gentlemen of the first, second, and third degre. I will giue to those of the first degre, the name of halfe Gentlemen, hauing at this tyme no more proper terme. I wil cal the second, Gentlemen: and the third, right Gentlemen. Nowe of halfe Gentlemen, I ordaine thre sorts, the first those which are Gentlemen only by birth, co~|ming of some auncient house, but hauing in themselues nei|ther good conditions nor good behauiour, nor so much as any shew of gentry.


Guaz.
Those in my opinion may rather be saide to be discended of Gentlemen, then to be Gentlemen indede:  these bee those which straine themselues to sweare at euery worde by the fayth of a Gentleman, when there is nooth required of them, by meanes whereof they make them|selues suspected, as witnesses which offer themselues before they be asked for: and they seme to be afeard least they should not be taken for Gentlemen, as those who are knowe~ in lookes, in wordes, and in dedes to be very clownes. And though they take vpon them the name of Courtiers, yet in their behauiour they shewe themselues little better then Carters.


Annib.
There is no cause why we should meruaile at those differences, for like as in fieldes, so in houses, there springeth vp fruite in great fertilitie, and in some processe of time, there come thereof excellent and famous men: and af|ter by little and little they fall to decay and become barren, so that the sharpenesse and goodnesse of the wit is chaunged, and degenerating is made grosse and blockish. Yea, it is eui|dently sene, that not onely houses and families waxe olde, but euen whole Cities, yea the worlde it selfe. Howe many auncient houses haue there ben, wherof there is not at this day any remembrance? or else they are brought into poore and vile estate.


Guaz.
Dant saith therof wel, that
Races razed are, and houses runne to wracke.



Annib.
Therevppon it is saide not without greate reason, that if one haue respect to the first originall, there is no king but is discended of slaues, nor slaue, but co~|meth of kings. And if you call to minde things of the tyme past, and compare them with the present, yea if you but haue regarde onely to the reuolution of our tymes, you shall se that as all other things, so houses turne like the whele, being nowe ascending, nowe at the highest, nowe discen|ding, nowe at the lowest. So that it may be sayde to be gen|try, both which beginneth, which increaseth, which dimini|sheth, and which vanisheth.


Guaz.
A man might also wel compare the state of gen|try to the course of the moone. But wherefore is it thinke you, that God causeth this alteration and chaunge in fami|lies?


Annib.
Perhaps to this end, that we should not hoorde vp for our selues any treasure on earth: and that we shoulde lift vp our selues to the contemplation of heauenly thinges, in which only a man may put his assurance. But there may be here alledged another occasion, whiche is, that God will suffer no euil to remaine vnpunished. For a famous writer, speaking of the nobilitie of the world, maketh it nothing else then auncient richesse, and addeth, that euery rich man is ei|ther vniust him selfe, or else the heire of some vniust man. Wherevppon he concludeth, that the gentry of ones house, taketh beginning of iniustice: and therefore we must not meruaile if things ill gotten are ill spent. But to returne to my purpose, these halfe Gentlemen, who being not by nature indued with any veriue, make boast of the woor|thinesse of their auncestours, are to be laughed at: For the more they set foorth the woorthinesse of them, the more they lay open the imperfection of themselues, for that there is nothing that maketh the childrens faultes more to be sene, then the bright shewe and glorious shyning of their fathers and graundfathers. And no doubt hee that hath no commendable thing in him, the more he speaketh of the gen|try of his auncestours, the more vile and contemptible he

sheweth himselfe. And therevpon it is growen into a Pro|uerbe that vnfortunate children extoll the vertues of their parents. God therefore kepe vs from the state of these halfe Gentlemen, whose dedes being not answereable to the nobilitie of their house, they are little accounted of in the worlde, and taken as it were for Bastardes. Wherefore we will conclude that in veritie and trueth we ought to respect the qualities and vertues whiche are in the parties them|selues, and that it is in vaine to stand vpon the renowme of our progenitours. Next vnto this first kind foloweth the se|cond of Gentlemen by good conditions.


Guaz.
Which take you to be the best of those two?


Annib.
Whether do you more account of those things which are gotte~ with labour and industrie, or of those which nature or fortune bestoweth vpon vs?


Guaz.
Why the first?


Annib.
And whether doe you thinke more excellent of the giftes of the mind, or of the body?


Guaz.
The giftes of the minde.


Annib.
Consider now that gentry by byrth costeth you nothing, but that you haue it by succession, mary gentry by vertue you haue gotten hardly, hauing first passed thorowe the pykes, and a thousande daungers. Moreouer we are to consider that gentry by blood belongeth to the body, but gentry by good conditions hath relation to the mind. Which made the tyrant Phalaris say, being demaunded what he thought of gentry, that he acknowledged gentry to come onely by the meanes of vertue, and al other things by the meanes of fortune, for that one of base birth may be|come most noble aboue all kings: and contrariwise one wel borne may become the most wretched and contemtible of the worlde: and that therefore we are to boast of the giftes of the minde, not of the gentry of our auncestours, which is alredie extinguished by the vnknowen and degenerated po|steritie. * Whervpon I thinke them worthy of great com|mendation, who from very lowe place with the ladder of their owne vertue climbe to most respected highnesse. As

many Popes, Emperours, and kings haue done being the sonnes of very meane men. *


Guaz.
Yet for al that you se how the world comme~ly reputeth gentry by byrth as legitimate, and gentry by ver|tue as bastardily, and farre inferiour to the other. And if you do but sounde the opinion of the Gentlemen of this Citie, they will, I warrant you in a manner all of them say vnto you that they had rather be borne Gentlemen and haue no|thing in the worlde but their rapier and cloake, then to be discended of base parentage, and to be Senatours or Pre|sidents.


Annib.
It is reported that the foxe cast his tayle about a yong treful of fruite to the intent to shake it  make the fruites fal to the ground, but fayling of his purpose he went his way, finding fault with y^e fruite, saying, they were with|out tast and not good ynough for him. The like doe those whom you speake of, who being not by vertue able to aspire to those degres, mislike of the degres, and of those persons who by their vertue haue attained vnto them. But assure your selfe that those which hold that erronious opinion, are for the most part voide of vertue. But if you shal talke with a Gentleman that is so by birth, who by the helpe either of learning or of armes hath gotten this second gentry, he wil no doubt make more account of the gentry purchased by his owne vertue, then of that which is discended vnto him by birth. So that I meruaile nothing though that common o|pinion take place, seing that the number of Gentlemen without vertue is farre greater then of those which be ver|tuous. Yet you remember that it was sayde yesterday, that the common opinion consisteth not in the number, but in the qualitie of the persons: and therefore the opi|nion which you haue brought foorth shall not be called common.


Guaz.
This same is one of the abuses of diuers countries  specially of Fraunce, where learning is so litle accou~ted of, that a Gentleman, though he bee scarce able to maintaine himselfe, thinketh scorne too applye his minde too

the studie either of the lawes or of phisick. And though there be no gentrie in a manner, to be compared to that of the Presidentes and Counsellours of the King, yet you se those that are Gentlemen borne, count them to bee but base and ignoble. But I haue sene many rightly serued, for this their corrupt opinion, or rather obstinacie: For I haue sene one of these Counsellours or Presidents (to kepe their state) suf|fer these Gentlemen which haue occasion to vse them, to knocke a great while at their gates, and when they are come in, they walke long time in the Court, or in the hall of the house, before they shall be admitted to their presence, and they are driuen oftentimes (after that he shal be moun|ted in hast vpon his Mule, to goe to the Palace) to lackey af|ter like slaues, so infourme him of their causes  sutes. But there was nothing in Fraunce which went more against my stomacke, then to see the Secretaries of noble men in so litle credite and reputation: whereas in Italy the Secretaries of Princes are had in great honor, and iustly for that they are partakers of their inward thoughtes, and the kepers as it were vpon trust of their honor  estimation. And in Fraunce he that hath a seruant which can coppie out writinges, and kepe count of his reuenewes in a booke, he giueth him forth|with the name of Secretarie.


Annib.
I haue reasoned many times with your bro|ther about that matter, who amongst other pleasant mat|ters tolde me, that in the voyage which hee made last, by post in Fraunce, being sent by the Duke our maister to the King, being to chaunge Horses in a certaine place, the Post|maister came vnto him, and called twise aloude (Secretary) and foorthwith there came out of the stable a foule great Groome with a pen  inkehorne at his girdle, and a pen at his eare, who had charge giuen him to make ready thre hor|ses: whervpon the secretary set hand to the harnesse,  sadled one of the~,  two other serua~ts did the like: one of which, your brother asked why his maister made y^e secretary dresse horse? who answered, that his maister tooke him for a Groome of the stable,  for their companion about y^e loking to the horse:

but for that he coulde wryte and keepe a reckoning of the horses which were let out, his Maister had like wyse made him his secretary.


Guaz.
Hee might wel say he was secretarie in Vtro|que, to wit, with the pen and the currycombe.


Annib.
He sayde moreouer, that when the Duke of Neuers sent him to the lodging of some Prince, or of the great chauncelour, or some other, he was soone let in, if he ter|med himself one of the Dukes gentlemen, but if hee named himselfe secretarie, they made him tarie longer, and regar|ded him the lesser. Nowe to returne to my purpose, I say a|gaine, that the Gentleman by vertue, is more excellent then the Gentleman by birth. Yea I coulde say vnto you, that many count gentry by blood to be foolish, and nothing at all: and amongst others a certaine wise man saide, that gentry of the minde, is, to be indued with woorthy thoughts: and the gentry of the body, is the gentlemanlike minde: mea|ning, that the gentry of the body, was not to be attributed to the house we came of. Another Philosopher affirmeth likewise, that it is in vaine called gentry, whiche referring it selfe to the worthinesse of blood, is not ours, but others. And therefore the light of another cannot make me shine, if there be no brightnesse in my selfe.


Guaz.
That is noted to vs by the saying of Dant, that only he is bright, who shineth of him selfe.


Annib.
A ma~ may also adde here the saying of our Galen, that those who being voide of vertue themselues, haue re|course to the cognisances and armes of their predecessours, se not how that vaineglorie is like certaine kinde of coyne, which is currant in those townes and places where it hath ben stamped and made, but it cannot be put away in other places, but is taken for counterfayte and naught. But I wil not here omit that which is excellently written in a letter, by his brother Frauncis Coronato, our Academike doctour in diuinitie, that they are to be laughed at, whiche take so much vppon them, to put difference betwene themselues and other, as if they had ben made by some other creatour

then God, for that the fleshe maketh no difference, nor one more excellent then another And though a vessel of gold be more estemed then one of Copper, for that it is of more pre|cious and fine matter; yet that cannot be saide of vs, who come all of one lumpe of fleshe. Yea the soule it self maketh no difference betwene vs, for so much as we come all of one father and creatour. But that which putteth a differe~ce betwene vs, is the vertue of the minde. So that neither in respect of the master nor of the fourme, nor of the mind, con|sidered of it selfe, but in respect of the vertue gotten  acqui|red by our owne industry, we are more excellent one then another. And therof we may nowe se that touching the ori|ginal, we are all one thing, and as one sayde, we are all made of durt: and as we haue one selfe beginning, so haue we likewise one selfe ende. Wherefore we are to con|clude, that gentry and renowme is not got by our birth, but by our life, yea and sometyme by our death, according to that saying,
A worthy death doeth honour al our life.


Guaz.
It may be well sayde also that a right Gentle|man is not borne as the Poet, but made as the Oratour.


Annib.
It is saide also that philosophy receiued not Plato a Gentleman, but made him one.


Guaz.
Yet, for al that in my opinion it is a good thing to be discended of a good and honorable house.


Annib.
I graunt you that, for gentle race, besides other good effects, maketh a man ashamed to degenerate from the vertue and valour of his auncestours. Yea and gentry is to be honored for this respect, that for the most part the better lineage we come of, the better behauiour wee are of. And therefore Q. Max Scipio, and others said, that beholding the pictures and ymages of their auncestours, they felt them|selues maruaylously stirred vp to vertue. Wheretoo prin|ces haue a regard, indeuouring alwaies to make gentlemen their chiefe officers. And truely it happeneth seldom that he doeth ill, who seth thereby the honour of his auncestours to|gether with his owne brought in danger.



Guaz.
There remaineth for you now to speake of the third sort of halfe Gentlemen.


Annib.
I ned not vse many words to you touching that sorte, and it sufficeth to say, that those same get their gentry by custome: and that this gentry is so weake, that it exte~deth not generally, but hath place only in some part. And albeeit a com soldiour, or a merchant, or other liuing of his owne reuenewes, bee not altogether taken for a Gentleman, yet there are some countries and townes, where, according to the custome; or by some other accident, they are taken for Gentlemen, and admitted indifferently into the companie of Gentlemen. And there fore according to that common o|pinion, those same may be called Gentlemen in their coun|trie, but not else where.


Guaz.
In few woordes, your minde is that those a|mongst the Italians, Spaniards, Frenchmen, Lombardes, or of any other nation, are Gentlemen, which are termed  taken so: and that a man may bee a gentleman or a yoman according to the custome of the place where hee is, out of which he shalbe otherwise by a contrary custome.


Annib.
My meaning is euen so. But seing wee haue spoken sufficiently of halfe Gentlemen, let vs speake nowe of Gentlemen which haue the two fiest kindes of gentry ioi|ned together: to witte, that by blood; and that by vertue. The Philosophers make great account of gentry by birth, when it is accompanied with vertue, without whiche it may be said to be dead, as a body without breath. And therefore if we looke thorowly into the matter, we shall finde that it happeneth seldome, that a house doth maintaine it selfe long in honour without vertue, or is able to rise to high estate  dignitie. For if one of base calling, giue the beginning to gen|try by the excellencie of some vertue, that is a certaine signe that vertue is the foundation of gentry, and that to maintaine gentry, it is necessarie to maintaine the founda|tion thereof.


Guazzo.
In trueth gentry is vnsemely without ver|tue, and in my opinion one that is borne a Gentleman,

is not woorthy of account, when he is not indued with good conditions.


Annib.
Leauing then the wrong opinion of some coun|tries, to come nere to the ancient maiestie of the Romanes, we wil hold for certaine that gentry increaseth no lesse by the vertue of learning, then by the prowesse of arme. For that this saying is most true that gentry is the daughter of knowledge: and that knowledge doeth gentellise him that possesseth it. And therefore the science and knowledge of good letters, being no lesse to be estemed of, then the knowledge of martiall feates, it is certaine that the gentry of the one, is no lesse then of the other. But for all this, wee must not thinke it sufficient for vs to be knowen to be but indiffe|rently learned and vertuous, but wee must indeuour to at|taine to excellencie therein. For the more good partes be in a man, the more Gentlemanlike he is sayde to be. And I can not here but speake of the folly of some Gentlemen, who hauing nothing but gentry by byrth to bragge of, are not ashamed to say, that they are as good Gentlemen as the Emperour, as if a Gentleman could not increase in gentry: And not considering that there are degres of gentry, as wel as of dignities and honours: and that one is so much more Gentleman * by birth * then another, by howe muche his gentry is more auncient, more renowmed, more manifest, and more mightie. Which may be sayde, not only in respect of birth, but also in respect of vertue. And as of the twoo dogs which Lycurgus brought before the Spartanes, which though they came both of one lytter, yet the one ran to the potage pot, the other at the hare: so of two brothers, the one shalbe more gentle then the other, by howe much hee shalbe more learned, vertuous, and placed in higher degre. And you knowe that without the spurres of preferment, to pricke men forward, the gentry of houses woulde soone decay, for no Gentleman woulde take paines to atchieue any thing woorthy of honour. To auoide which inconuenience, wee ought to haue in our mindes the saying of Galen, which is, If we be Gentlemen, let vs not shew our selues vnworthy

of our house: if we come of a meane house, let vs by our deds rayse it to renowme. But what speake I of Galen, let vs thinke of that diuine saying, You are the children of Abra|ham doe the woorkes of Abraham. Yet in my opinion it is not ynough to follow the trace of woorthie predecessours, but wee must lay before vs the noble deuise of Charles the fifth, to wit, the pillers of Hercules, and to dispose our selues to goe beyond them, and to attaine to such vertue, as may woorthily be termed heroycall. For if it be a great delight for a man to know, that from time to time out of his house, (as out of the Troyan horse) there haue yssued captaines, Colonels, and knightes, like as out of the vniuersities of Pauia, Padua, and Bologna, there come doctours of philoso|phie, phisicke, and lawe, howe much more good shall it doe him, who may say, that he hath, according to the Prouerbe, * wings broder then the nest, * and by the excellencie of his deedes, and sufficiencie in learning and feates of armes, hath surpassed the desertes, dignities, and degrees of his pre|decessours, and alone as it were caried away the price. By the example of Augustus, who sayd, I found Rome of stones and brickes, but I haue left it of marble. Nowe to dispach this matter, these gentlemen whom I speake of, may make their boaste to haue twoo aduantages aboue gentlemen by birth onely. The first is, vertue, the other curtesie, the right ornament of a Gentleman: For of curtesie and gentlenes he is termed a gentleman.


Guaz.
When a man is gentle both by birth and vertue, I see not what may be added more vnto him,  yet besides those two sortes of Gentlemen, you haue set downe a third kinde of right or absolute gentlemen. By which termes you put me in minde of aqua vitae, and such like, which are three times stilled.


Annib.
Like as in the third distillation is bestowed greater charge, and more excellent matter ariseth of it, so in these absolute gentlemen there are required greater giftes, and greater perfection they are indued withall. To be short, I call those absolute gentlemen, who to their gentrie by

byrth and vertue, haue great riches ioyned: which serue greatly to the maintenance of gentrie.


Guaz.
You haue now opened my eyes, and I know that I was not before thorowly awakes. I se now apparantly that there is nothing maketh gentry more bright, and shi|ning, then the brightnesse of gold and siluer: wherin a man may say there consisteth another kind of gentrie.


Annib.
In proofe of that which you say, some would haue it that riches should make gentrie, but I cannot thinke the~ to haue so great force, for that were to debase ge~try too much. But I may be bolde to say this, that though riches can adde no degre to gentrie, yet they are a readie instrument to put in practise certain vertues belonging to gentrie: and especi|ally liberalitie, wherby gentry, like a glasse stricken with y^e beames of the fun is made more bright  shining. And ther|fore these absolut gentleme~ make the~selues seme aboue al o|ther. Wherof are to be sene particuler exa~ples in those ci|ties, where there are vniuersities or schooles For there gen|tlemen of great welth will shew themselues aboue a great number of other scholler. Yet perchance they are no better borne no indued w^t beter co~ditions the~ the other are,  yet by reason of  rhes they one more accou~ted of And as a preious stone  fine gold  curiously wrought is more goodly to sight, then another that lacketh y^e workmanship, so those gentlemen which kepe open housholde, which haue a great train after the~,  which spend much  frely, are much more estemed of th other co~mon scholers, who are gentle|men to,  yet those former are honored and courted of them.


Guaz.
In co~clusion the power of riches is great  a man may se that al things are in subiection to monie.


An.
It is shewed vnto vs by an Epigram tra~slated out of greke w^c was vttered y^e other day in the Academy,  is this.


amongst the Gods to place,
The earth, the water and the winde,
and Sunne with shining face.
The starres and the fire,
but as for mee I take.
Siluer and golde to bee the Gods,
which most for men doe make:
To yeelde them their content,
and if thou them possesse,
Of houses landes, seruantes, and friendes,
thou shalt haue great excesse.
And if thou freely wilt
in bribes thy coyne bestowe,
Both iudge, and iurie will bee prest,
all fauour thee to sowe.
Yea Gods from heauen will hither come
all honour thee o doe,



Guaz.
It is said, that golde breake thre gates of Dia|mant,  that the tongue hath no force when gold speaketh.


Annib.
We wil say then according to these opinions, that where power  ries are greatest, their gentry is grea|test  perhaps it was therfore that Galigula the Emperour hearing certain princes reason of Nobilitie said, That it be|longed only to an absolute prince meaning, that it was pro|per only to the Emperour. But laying apart these opinions, I am of this mind that riches ioyned with good birth,  good conditions, make not a man an absolute gentleman, if they be nt accompanied with that royall vertue; called magni|ficence and if hee bestow not those riches bountifully as is mete for his estate.


Guaz.
I you will haue riches to be a helpe to gentry, it shal behoue a man rather to be sauing, that he may be able to kepe himselfe rich, for according to the saying of y^e Poet.

The vertue is unlesse to keepe, then for to get.

And I remember. I haue heard tel how a king of Fraunce going to se the lodgings  roomes of a faire house belonging to the steward of his houshold, said, That the kitchin was a great dealer too litle, in respect of the greatnesse of the house, but the steward answered him, that, that small kitchin had made the house so great.


Annib.
It is wel doone to know how a man spendeth, but I altogether misike couetousnes, which is an enimy to gen|try and a token of a base minde. And here I woulde haue

you call to minde some rich Gentlemen, who hauing, or (to speak more properly) possessing ith riches, suffer nothing but smoke to goe foorth of their houses: and as if they were driuen to it of necessitie, goe with a pielde threede bare cloke on their backe, with a gresie Cap on their head, their hose torne and patcht, neither can they any way excuse their mi|serablenes, but by saying we are known wel enough, we ei|ther haue better, or wee may haue better:  hauing a horse in y^e stable, yet they think they may honestly enough walk on foot. I am sure you cannot abide that these gentlemen should stande vpon their gentrie, so muche as those which keepe a worshipful house, open aswel to strangers, as to their neigh|bours, and chiefly, to the poore and honest whiche they are bonde to doe (being able) thereby to mainteine the name and worship of the auncestours, and to shewe themselues their lawefull successories. To be short, riches well besto|we, are a great ornament,  setting foorth to a gentleman.


Guaz.
The harder is the state of poore Gentlemen, who are constrained by necessitie to liue like owles in the darke.


Annib
Amongst other inconuenientes,  discommo|dities, which ptie is bringeth to a Gentleman, this is one, and no small one that he is some times driuen to match him selfe in marriage with some woman of base parentage, by reason whereof, his blood is corrupted, and his children de|generate, who after follow the nature of neither father nor mother.


Guaz.
Though our Borcace mainteine that pouertie taketh not away gentrie, yet in my opinion, it doeth at least dismember it, weaken it, disfurnish it, turne it into it dublet, yea, and strippeth it starke naked.


Annib.
Some of those poore gentlemen are to be pitied, to wit, those who by some mischance  euill hap, not by their owne fault, are become poore and low. But those are worthy blame, who knowing themselues to be poore, indeuour not while they are yong, either by learning, either by war, either by seruice, to withstand pouertie, which they know to be the

ouerthrow of gentry. But you know there are many, whom their noble birth maketh ignoble: For they think, in y^t they are borne gentlemen, they neuer need seke other reputation or countenance. And if you doe but looke about these moun|taines without going any farther, you shal see some houses so ful of Gentlemen, al companions  equalles in this seig|neorry, that euery one of them hath scarce a little hole to shrowd himselfe in: and they come at diuerse doores so thick as it were conies out of a Berrie. And grounding them|selues altogether vpon that little smoke of gentle birth, they suffer themselues to be restie as it were like Bacon with yolenesse: or else to be carried through necessitie to commit shamefull and dishonest deedes. * So that it may be sayd, that by resting in their seigneory, they loose their gentry: yea, and now and then, loose both the one and the other *. It is not long since, that a friend of mine of Moncaluo told me he sawe at the market a poore wretch, who hauing brought thither an Asse loaden with wood, when hee that would haue bought it of him, offered him lesse then he liked to sell it for, he sware by the fayth of a Gentleman that he had solde another loade for a great deale more mony, mary he woulde sell the same somewhat better cheape.


Guaz.
I would sooner haue beleeued him if hee had sworne by the eare of the Asse. But perchance hee made himselfe beleeue that to leade an Asse to the market to serue his owne turne, was no staine to his gentry.


Annib.
There are some which hold with these (misers rather then Gentlemen) saying, that to doe such thinges for a mans owne behoofe, doeth not derogate so much from his gentrie, as if he did it for hire, and for the seruice of o|thers: and they alleage for themselues the example of a Philosopher, who being found fault withall for carying fish vnder his cloke, answered, that it was for his owne eating: inferring thereby, that (according to the prouerbe) it is an yl horse that wil not carie his owne prouender.


Guaz.
I thinke I haue also hearde that in some coun|tries, he which with his owne handes fylleth his grounde

or doth any other worke belonging to husbandry, looseth not thereby one iote of his gentry. But for my parte I will al|waies pray, good Lord deliuer me from such kind of gentry.


Annib.
Therein, as I haue alredie said, we must haue regarde to the custome of the Countrie,  it shalbe no mar|uell at al vnto vs, to se in some townes certaine gentlemen (contrary to the order of other townes) goe to the Butchery, and Market,  buy victuals,  cary in their handkerchiefes or table napkins, salados, fruite, fish, or some other small trifle.


Guaz.
For my part, I woulde be loth to doe so, and I had rather liue only with dry bread.


Annib.
Neither doe I (I promise you) like of that fa|shion, but we must beare somewhat with pouertie, which perchaunce forceth them to it, or els perhaps it hath ben an ancient vse amongst them,  the time may come, that it shal be left. But to returne to our purpose, the richer a Gentle|man is, the greater he is. For riches no doubt cary credite  fauour with them, for when the rich speaketh, euery one ke|peth silence, but when the poore speaketh, it is saide, what fel|low is that? And therfore let vs hold as an Oracle the saying of Horace.

Birth and good qualities are nothing worth,
if riches from them hee shut foorth.

And for conclusion of our discourse, we will say that a man is established,  set in the highest  surest degre of gentrie, when his seat is vpholden with these thre most strong fet, good birth, good qualities, and riches.


Guaz.
I like very well of your witty distinction, but for that you said not long agoe, that curtesie  gentlenes is the chiefe ornament of a gentleman, it co~meth now in my mind to aske you whether a Gentleman by birth, degenerating from his auncestours,  from his owne nature, vsing neither curtesie nor vertue, may rightly be tearmed a Gentleman.


Annib.
Though curtesie necessarily appertain to a gentle|man, yet you se it is wanting in y^e most part of those which are gentlemen born, which co~meth to passe for the reason al|redy giue~. But touching those, who not only want y^e gentle|manly

instinct, but besides liue dissolutly, I can say no more, but that a man borne wel,  liuing yll, is a monstrous thing,  worthie to be abhorred. And it is a common saying, That gentry standeth the euill in as much sted, as a looking glasse doth to a blind man. But to satisfie more fully your demau~d, I wil conclude this matter with another common distincti|on, according to which it is saide, that there are Gentlemen of Gentlemen, Gentlemen of base, and base of Gentlemen. Gentlemen of Gentleme~ are those, who, descending of wor|thy ancestours, tread in their steps. Gentle of base, are those who extracted fro~ loe parentage, raise themselues to gentry by their vertue. Base of gentle are those, who degenerating from the vertue of their forefathers, are become naught,  vicious. But it is high time to think of the rest of y^e matters which we are to intreate of this day,  to consider what is to be obserued in y^e conuersation of gentlemen  yome~ together.


Guaz.
I see by you then, you meane to alow them to com|pany together, but in my opinion, suche company,  such con|fusion is not good. And you se that most co~monly gentlemen resort to their equals,  that if they acco~pany with yeomen, and those which are their inferiours (if vrgent busines driue them not to it) they are discommended, and little estemed of other Gentlemen.


Annib.
There are many gentlemen, who not vnderstan|ding what gentry is, thinke it an euil  infamous thing not to be a gentleman,  therfore they flie fro~ it as from y^e plague,  they think it no lesse shame to be sene in the co~pany of the baser sort, then to be taken in the common stewes: not kno|wing y^t there is no more difference betwene the gentleman  the yeoman, then there is betwen two brickes made of self same earth: whereof the one is set in the top of a towre, the o|ther in the bottome of a wel. Yet there are some gentlemen of better dispositio~, who frequenting for y^e most part, the co~pa|ny of gentlemen, take no scorne when occasion serueth to ac|cept of the company of those which are no gentlemen. Nowe in these same differences in my iudgement, the first, by ben|ding the bow too much, breake it in sunder,  by shuting vp y^e treasure of ge~trie too closely, shew a kind of inciuilitie  chur|lishnesse,

odious not onely to the worlde, but to GOD him selfe: for that they vouchsafe not for brothers, and compani|ons, those whom he auoucheth for his children. The other, in my minde doe two acts of gentrie, in that accompanying with Gentlemen they degenerate not from their kinde, and frequenting the meaner sort, they expresse that gentlenes  curtesie which is proper to a Gentleman. According to that philosophical and Christian saying, That the more loftie we are placed, the more lowly we ought to humble our selues: which is in ded, the way to ryse higher. Besides, the gentle|man which vseth the companie of his inferiours, giueth,  receiueth singuler pleasure: For that they are maruellous wel apaid when they se a Gentleman, notwithstanding the inequalitie, which is betwene them, to make him selfe their equall. Wherby they are induced to loue him, to honor him, and to doe him seruice: and whereby they themselues winne credite, and are the better estemed of by their equals. But the pleasure which the gentleman receiueth is great deale more, who conuersing with other Gentlemen, is faine to frame himself ofttimes to their fancie: knowing that euery one will looke for as much preheminence euery way as him|selfe, but in consorting with his inferiours, he shalbe y^e chief man amongst them,  rule the co~panie as he list, neither shal be forced to say or do any thing co~trary to his minde: which libertie is seldome allowed him, being amongst his equals.


Guaz.
And for that purpose, when I chaunce to goe a|broade to recreate my selfe, I accompany my self more com|monly with one that is inferiour to me, then with my equal: For with my equall, I must for good manner sake, seke ra|ther to follow his mind then mine owne,  make as though I liked of that, which liketh me nothing at all, going with my fete sometime thither whyther I go not with my hart. But I doe with my inferiour what I list,  dispose of him at my pleasure, so that I finde the companie of my equals to be as it were seruitude, and of my inferiours, libertie.


Annib.
You haue reason,  therfore you se that for the most part a gentleman maketh his abode in a village or Ma|ner,

wherof he is lord, where he semeth to be a king: for that he is there obeyed,  nothing done contrarie to his pleasure. Which he shall not haue in a Citie, where hee is no more then other Citizens are,  where he is muche lesse respected.


Guaz.
Seing you will not that a man shall refuse the companie of the meaner sort, I thinke it nedefull to shewe, which of them are chiefly to be admitted into company.


Annib.
When nede shall require, it shall not be amisse to conforte with all sortes of persons, though of neuer so base condition: which Diogenes ment to shew, who being asked, why he went to drinke at the Tauerne, answered, I like|wise goe to be powled in the Barbers shop. And there vpon we se that diuers Gentlemen of this Citie, are not asha|med to be sene in the open stret talking with diuers work|men, Artificers, and handiecraftes men, for necessaries ap|pertaining to their house and housholde. But if necessitie constraine vs not, we ought not to admit into our compa|nie others then those, who, though they be not Gentlemen by birth and calling, yet haue ciuilitie in their behauiour, and wit in their talke, which maketh them differ altogether from the common sort. And touching Gentlemen, it be|hooueth them to knowe, that they are subiect to some infir|mities, amongest the which, arrogancie is one, which is too commonly vsed, especially by Gentlemen of the first sorte, who haue nothing to stande vppon, but the good house they come of. And therefore saying aside their loftie lookes, they ought to beholde their inferiours with a more gracious eye, and to vse curtesie towardes them, which as we said before, as proper to Gentlemen, and by meanes whereof, they get the good will of their worsers. Otherwise, let them be sure they shall incense the whole people against them, and conse|quently, by the common voice of the people to be verie yll spoken of. Besides, to confemne the meaner sort, may some|times doe a man great displeasure as it did to a Citizen of Rome, of the house of the Scipioes, who, while hee laboured to be one of the Officers called Aediles, met with a country fellowe, whom he tooke by the hande, which feling to be

rough and harde brauned, he scoffingly askt him whether he vsed to goe with his handes or with his fete, which set the husbandman in such a rage against him, that like fire amon|gest flaxe, he stirred vp the whole people against him, and so wrought the matter, that for lacke of voices, he went without the office he stoode for, and to his great shame, he learned howe hatefull and hurtfull a thing it is for a braue gentleman, to mocke  scorne a simple soule of the country. * Wherfore let not a gentleman braue ouer those which are no gentlemen, but let him remember that his gentrie tooke beginning of one who was no gentleman. Which is giuen vs to vnderstand by the Poet, which saieth,
The first who ere he was,
of whom they race did growe:
Some shepheard was, or els, some such,
whose name I will not sheme.
Moreouer, let him remember that Gentlemen were ad|monished by Christ that they should not be puft vp with vain glorie, for so much as they ought to say with the common sort (Our father which art in heauen) which they can not say with a pure and vnfaigned heart; if they take not yeoman and poore men for their brothers. To be short, they ought to print this in their heartes, that no man is to be commen|ded for the gentrie of his auncestours, nor to be reprehen|ded for their basenesse. And they must knowe, that he which despiseth the vnnoble, despiseth his first fathers, and consequently, his owne selfe. Wherefore it is the part of a Gentleman to behaue him selfe so gently and curteously in all his dooinges, * that out of his eyes, tongue, and maners, his gentlemanly minde may shewe foorth. * And he that is not willing to take this course, must content him selfe to be a Gentleman only in his owne conceite, for he may not looke that any man els will take him so. Nowe tou|ching the vnnoble or yeomen, they must not for all this, thinke them selues without imperfection, for many of them haue an infirmitie more greuous and pernicious then any before rehearsed: which is, that they will not acknowledge

 confess the  inferiour to Gentlemen, both by nature, fortune,  vertue: not knowing y^e amongst the seuen degres of superioritie, this is particularly set downe of Gentlemen ouer the vaser sorte, who by all reason ought to submitte themselues to their will and pleasure. As then by some in|firmitie of the eyes, if it be not soone healed, a man quickly becommeth blinde, so of this imperfection in the common people, some of them fall into suche blinde arrogancie, and so foolish a vaine, that they wil not sticke to vaunt the~selues to be that which they are not, and both in their talke and in their apparel braue it out like Gentlemen.


Guaz.
A goodly matter I promise you when men will goe about (as our Boccace sayth) to make an Orenge tre of a briry bush. In my minde those which extol themselues in wordes and bragge of their birth, rather disgrace them|selues then otherwise. Like the poore drudge brought in in the Comedie, who tolde that his father was a goldsmith, and being asket what worke hee did belonging to that occupati|on, answered, that hee set stones in morter. Or like the mule who being demaunded of his birth, and beeing ashamed to say that hee was an Asses sonne, answered, that hee was a horses cosin. But this fault of chaunging and faigning of names and callings, in my fancie is more vsed in our coun|trie then in any other. And if you marke the Spaniardes here with vs (notwithstanding two moneths before they had not a shoe to put on their foote, and confessed them|selues to be poore and nedie) yet when they haue pickt vp their crummes a little, they will be maister one of another, and vse great honour and ceremonies, to the ende that wee should the better account of them. I thinke they durst not doe this in their owne countrie, but here they are bolde to doe it, for that they se it ordinarily done amongst vs: and that he will boast himselfe to come of an auncient house, whose father neuer so much as came in place where a Gen|tleman had ben. You shal se other some, being the childre~ of coblers  pedlers, who hauing gotten a little wealth, take vpon them very higly, and become most currish and cruel.



Annib.
Doe you not know the saying of the Poet, that
There is no rigour like to his,
who from lowe state extolled is.


Guaz.
And therefore I thinke the example verie rare, yea, and singular of King Agathocles: who, being a Potters sonne, would alwayes eate his meate in earthen vessell, to the end, that hauing alwayes freshe in minde his fathers ob|scurenesse, he shoulde take no pride of his owne greatnesse. But howe litle is this example followed by many riche Pe|santes, who are not ashamed to attire them selues like Gen|tlemen, to weare weapons by their side, and suche like or|naments, which are proper only to gentlemen: before whom they will make no curtesie to take place. And this abuse is so in vse at this day in Italy, that as well in men as wome~, a man can discern no difference in estates. And you shal se the Clownes will be as braue as the Artificers, the Artificers as the Merchantes, and the Merchantes as the Gentlemen. In so muche that a Taylour vsing to weare weapons, and to be appareled like a Gentleman, is not knowne what he is, vntill he be sene sowing in his shop. But you shall not se this disorder and confusion in Fraunce, where, by aunci|ent custome seuerall apparell is worne, according to euerie ones calling. So that by the garments only, you may know whether a woman be the wife of an Artificer, a Merchaunt, or Gentleman: And which is more, by the apparel, you shall knowe a difference betwene Gentlewomen them selues, for some attire is proper to Ladies, and those that attende in the Court vppon some Quene or Princesse, likewise to the wiues of Presidentes, Counsellours, and principal Ma|gistrates, which neuerthelesse is not allowed to euerie Gen|tlewoman.


Annib.
Our abuse herein is in dede insupportable, and requireth that Princes should put their handes hereto, and cut the combes of these clownish cockscombes, and make them come downe from their degre of gentrie, by forcing them to weare suche apparell as may bee at least different from Gentlemen, if they will nedes haue it as costly, for be|sides,

that vnder such a maske there may be much falshood wrought, it is reasonable also, that as princes woulde finde themselues greeued with gentlemen if they would preferre themselues before them any way, so they ought not to suf|fer the honour and degree of gentrie to be disgraced by the presumption of malapert clownes. But bee it that there were no way to refourme that abuse, yet those who are gentlemen indede, ought not to be mooued with the mat|ter, but rather to laugh at it. For the Asse which put on the Lyons skin (thinking that thereby his maister woulde more respect him) was knowne for an Asse, and vsed like an Asse. Now for so much as in this matter of ciuile conuer|sation, we haue not vndertaken to speake of the manner of apparell, wee will leaue this digression, and come to conclude, that yeomen ought to know their degree, and by a certaine kinde of humilitie to shew themselues inferiours to Gentlemen in doing them reuerence: Assuring them|selues, that as by saucy presumption they make themselues hated, so by lowly humilitie, they make themselues loued of Gentlemen.
But I see well nowe wee haue stayed so long vp|pon the discourse touching Gentlemen, that wee shall bee faigne to passe ouer lightly and briefly the conuersation of princes.


Guaz.
Nay rather it were requisite that you made thereof a long speech for that the faultes of Prin|ces are many and more greeuous then those of priuate per|sons: i the Poet say true, which sayth
The more infectious is the fault,
and followed of the moe.
By how much higher he is plast.
That doeth yll sample showe.
And if you marke it well, an euill Prince doeth not onely suffer himselfe to be corrupted, but besides hee cor|rupteth others: for that his subiectes take delight to follow

his fashions, and thinke it not onely tollerable, but very resonable to conforme them selues to their heade. By reason whereof they doe more harme by their example, then by their offence.


Annib.
I had rather wee might say nothing at all of this matter. For there want not writers, both of the times past and present, who haue taken the courage and the care to instruct princes, and to set downe thorowely what their life and conuersation ought to be. Besides wee are to consider, that it pertaines not to vs to speake of their dooinges, which are reprehensible and incom|prehensible. And to speake my fancie freely, I haue alwayes blamed in my mynde, those which will appoint lawes and orders of life to Princes, who are Lordes ouer Lawes, and inioyne them to others. And therefore by my will wee will not * apply the humilitie of our Philosophie to the Maiestie of Princes: * for that bee|ing Gods on earth, it is to bee thought, that all which they doe is done well: and that to reason of and call into question their dooinges, is nothing else, but with the Gy|ants, to lay siege to heauen.


Guaz.
I perceiue well, that according to the Prouerb you loue to stand fare of from Iupiter,  light|ning, being assured that no man shall accuse you for that you shall not say, and me thinkes you haue regarde to that which is sayde by one, That to reprehend princes it is dan|gerous, and to commend them, plain lying.


Annib.
It is so farre of, that I meant to  any such thing, that I did not so much as think it. For being perswaded that they holde of the diuinitie, I thinke they cannot easily erre or commit acte woorthie reprehensi|on. Neyther can I choose but laugh at certaine curious fellowes, who discoursing of the affaires of the worlde, and not knowing the hidden secretes of the deepe deuises of the Pope, the Emperour, the king o great Turks make of their doings a thousande wrong and fond interpretations, being farre wide of their thoughtes And they perswade

them selues that princes are fooles: that they liue at all aduentures without aduye and coulisayle, and that matters should goe better if they themselues were Princes.


Guaz.
The stinges of those which eate their bread, and liue in one selfe court with them, are farre more pricking to Princes, then of those which stande so farre of, descanting vppon their dooings. Wherevppon a certaine king vsed to say, that hee was like a Planetre, vnder whose boughes, while the weather is foule, many shroude themselues, but when fayre weather commeth, they pull it vppe by the rootes, so he gaue succour to many whiche were afflicted with the stormes of trouble and miserie, who afterwardes when the minde of prosperitie began once to blowe with them, bended themselues to his ruine and ouer|throwe.


Anniball.
Do you thinke that Princes are ignorant of it.


Guaz.
No I warrant you, for like Gods they knowe not onely what men say, but what they thinke. But belike to their diuine knowledge to tell what men thinke, and to their delicate eares to heare what men say, they lacke sharpe and pearcing tongues to tell those of their faultes, which abuse them.


Annib.
Those which dare abuse Princes seme neuer to haue read that verse,
Knowest not that Princes hands, will reach a great way of.
Neither to knowe that the eares of the Asse fastened to Midas, meane that he easilie vnderstoode what euery man sayde and did. They knowe not also that Princes partake with the deuine power, being able to pull downe the migh|ty and set vp the weake.


Guaz.
Yea but if Princes woulde punishe such fel|lowes they shoulde doe a dede of iustice, But I se wel that in this point they had rather conforme themselues to diuine mercy then to due iustice. For commonly they wil not once haue the matter called in question.



Annib.
That is the right act of a Prince, and therefore it is well saide, That the Egle catcheth not flies.


Guaz.
Say also hardly, that they are so farre of from taking punishment of suche fellowes, that many times they doe most good to those, who speake most euill of them.


Annib.
Weighing belike that the good will bee content with enough, and that they are sure alwayes to be in league with them, but the yll being insatiable, they thinke it nede|full to giue them one dishe aboue commons, to stoppe their mouthes. Nowe for so much as the great mysteries of Prin|ces are not easie to be discouered, it shal suffice vs to know, that * though some of them fall out yll (which I will not de|nie) yet for the most part we se they are good, * and accor|ding to the Prouerbe, haue alwayes an eye on the Scepter neither doe at any time any thing which any man, no not Momus him selfe, may iustly finde fault withall, or which is not to be well thought of by all. Behold for example, the reuerent and redoubted maiestie of the King of Spain, wher|by filling mens heartes with the reuerence of him, he is as it were adored like an Idole of Princes  Potentates, and you will yelde vnto me, that with great vertue he maketh him selfe knowne for a King, and with great dignitie main|taineth his royall estate. Laye before your eyes the milde and gracious countenaunce of the most Christian King of Fraunce, his incredible curtesie and affabilitie, whereby as I heare, and as you ought to knowe, he maketh him selfe lo|ued and obeyed, rather of his familiars and friendes, then seruantes and subiectes, and you will say, that by that hu|militie he exalteth his royall throne, if it might possibly be raysed higher. Present to your viewe (if your eyes bee able to beholde it without dazeling) the famous gouernment of the Quene of England, the reuerence is borne her by stran|gers, the obedience by her subiectes, the feare of some, the loue of all, her stoutnesse in contemning her enemies, her stayednesse in sticking to her friendes, her pollicie in preuen|ting perils, her clemency in punishing offences, her proui|dent care for her countrey, her tender loue towardes her

people, her exalting of the good, her disgracing of the ill, her singular humilitie in most soueraigne maiestie, her stayed temperancy in most flourishing prosperity, her rare modestie accompanied with exquisite learning, her maidenly chasti|ty, ioyned with heaue~ly beautie, to be short, her vnspeakable perfection in al things, and you wil say that spight it selfe can not deface her doings any way, and that in spight of spight she will triumph ouer all yll tongues, yea and ouer al those which enuie her happinesse: you will say with Aristotle, that prudency is only proper to Princes, and with the scripture, that Princes heartes are in the hand of God, and that hee doeth direct them by his diuine wisedome.


Guaz.
Why how now Gentleman, what tempest of af|fection hath caried you thus away into the commendation of a Prince, whom you neuer saw, nor to whom you are behol|ding any way? I must  will say in ded that she is the rarest woman of the world, I must confesse her gouernment to be most glorious,  the commendations which you giue her to be both due and true: but yet I must say, that like a mer|chant willing to set forth his ware, you haue blazed forth her perfections, but you haue concealed her faultes: you haue made no mention how she hath banished out of her country the aucthoritie of our holy father the Pope, howe throughout all her dominions she hath planted a religion different from the faith which wee and our forefathers haue ben alwayes trayned vp in: Which faultes are so foule, that like a spot in a gorgeous garment, they are a great blemishe to the brightnesse of her renowme. But were she voide of them, I could not then but say with you, that she were to be thought rather a heauenly Goddesse, then an earthly Princesse.


Ann.
If there be nothing else to kepe her from heauen but her religion, no doubt but she shal goe thither so soone as God shal plague her subiects so sore as to take her from them: For I can tell you this, that the most learned men in the worlde are of this opinion, that her religion is the very high way to heauen. And though for my part I make no account of it, for





that I know it not, neither meane to deale in matters of re|ligion, for that I professe it not, yet if a tre be knowne by it fruites, no doubt but this tre is good, which bringeth foorth such fruits, as the like are not to be found in y^e whole world againe: As first, a Prince indued with such pietie, such puri|tie, such good giftes, such rare vertue, that she may be a pat|terne for all Princes to practise by: then graue  wise Coun|sellours, referring all their thoughts  doings to Gods glo|ry, to their Princes safetie, and their countries commodity. Next, a wel disposed  orderly comminaltie, ruled as much by religion as law, obeying aswel for conscie~ce as for feare: And last of al, continual peace and quietnesse, which is a sin|guler blessing of God,  an vndoubted signe, that he lyketh wel of her religion, and is wel pleased with her procedings.


Guaz.
If you can gather so much goodnesse out of that whiche I obiected against her as a fault, I will hereafter finde no more fault with her, but honour her as one without all fault. Therefore I pray you returne to the matter wee haue in hande.


Annib.
I say then (as I saide before) that therefore you ought to thinke that al the purposes and procedings of prin|ces, are grounded vppon discretion and iudgement, and that they doe all thinges better then we are able to proportion them out vnto them: of whom I may say that whiche King Leonidas saide, to whom as one obiected, Thy kingdome ex|cepted, thou hast nothing more then wee: Yea, answered he, but I had not ben King, if I had not ben better then you.


Guaz.
That fellowe coulde not be without a reply to beate backe the nayle againe: but perchaunce he liked better to yelde with his tongue, then with his heart, by the exam|ple of the Peacocke, who saide the Eagle was a fayrer byrde then he, not in respect of his feathers, but of his beake and talents, which caused that no other birde durst stand in contention with him.


Annib.
Well, I say to you againe, that the dooings of Princes are blamelesse, altogether without the compasse of

our iudgement, and alwaies mistaken of vs: for those who~ we take to be cruell, are iust: those whom we suppose to vse extremity in iustice, vse lenitie in mercy: those who ordei|ning new  extraordinary imposts  paiments are thought to bee couetous, deserue rather to be counted prouident and wise, for that they are not moued thereto by auarice, which cannot enter into their noble hearts, but for the conseruati|on of their owne estates,  their people. So that the imper|fection of our iudgementes maketh vs take all their perfec|tions cleane contrary.


Guaz.
I know not how you can attribute these perfec|tions to all Princes, seing the histories are full of naughty Emperours and Kings, which liued most wickedly.


Annib.
I doe confesse it vnto you, neither do I maruell any thing at it, for that they were not Princes by nature, but by violence, neither had they any knowledge of Gods worde, yea  were rather feared then loued: whereby they themselues were forced to feare others,  to kepe them vpon their gardes, for he y^t will be feared, must of force feare those whiche feare him. To bee short, they were vniust, disloy|all, couetous, lasciuious, which rewarded the euill, and per|secuted the good, who for a kingdomes sake woulde haue it lawfull to breake all lawes,  they were those in reproch of whom the fable is told of y^e Lion, who entred into agreme~t with other beasts, that like good fellowes they should distri|bute the prayes which they tooke amongst the~ al indifferent|ly. But afterward, euery one co~ming to demaund his part, he shewed them his teth, saying, The first part is mine, be|cause I am better then you: I wil haue the second, for that I am more mightie the~ you: the third, by reaso~ is due vnto me, for that I tooke more paine in the taking of it then you: and for the fourth, if you wil not giue it me, I will haue it spight of your teth,  so farewel frendship. And therfore it is not to be maruelled at, that these tyrants for the most part died of some violent death, by sword, or by poyson. On the otherside you know that y^e princes of our time, come to their crownes either naturally by succession, or lawefully by election,

that they are Christians, and indued with the knowledge of the trueth: that they are sente by God, to maintaine iustice on the earth, to defend vs from oppression, to represse the insolent, to reiecte flatterers, to respect the vertuous, to gratifie the good, and to shew themselues both in worde and dede, no lesse stayed and vnmoueable, then the corner stone, or the celestiall Pole.


Guaz.
But for all this, it would like me well (seing you deny not, but that there are some Princes subiecte to some infirmities) that following your course, you woulde giue some preceptes, touching the conuersation betwene Princes and priuate persons, that our discourses may be in|sufficient in no parte.


Annib.
For so much as you wil haue mee, contrarie to my determination, to speake of this matter, I will binde my selfe onely to matters of most importaunce, and I will leaue to you (who are well experienced in the dispositi|on and qualities of Princes) to giue iudgement what be|longeth to them in euery poynt. There are then two special imperfectio~s in Princes, wherby they soone come to loose ho|nour, state, lyfe, soule, and all together. The first is, Igno|rance, which carieth a Prince into many inco~uenie~ces. And surely it is a great abuse, that Princes haue not the know|ledge of good letters, but are faigne to vse that shift, which an Emperour vsed, who being reproued, for that he spake contrary to the rules of Grammer: answered, that if an Em|perour were aboue the lawes, much more was he aboue the rules of Grammer. But he shewed thereby, that he knew not that there is nothing more behoofull for the vpholding of Empires and kingdomes then learning. For we must thinke that a Prince void of learning, must nedes either be|haue himself disorderly in his gouernme~t: for that according to the saying of the Philosopher, ignora~ce ioyned with puis|saunce, bringeth forth madnesse: or els like an infa~t, he must refer himself wholy to the discretion of others: as the Em|perour Galba did, who though he were not altogether with|out learning, yet he gaue himselfe in pray to 3. of his officers com+monly

called the Schoolemaisters of Galba, who nurtu|red him in naughtinesse, and were the cause of his ouer|throwe.


Guaz.
Therevpon it is saide, that as that Prince doth ill which dealeth in matters of his owne head without ad|uise, so he doeth scarce wel which suffreth himselfe to bee o|uerruled by others, and of a maister becommeth a seruant. And it is a great chaunce when the Officers se the Prince so very a childe, but that they will conspire to cosin him, to set his honour to sale, and to make a very iest and laughing stocke of him.


Annib.
Therevppon it is sayde that a Countrie is in better case where the Prince is euil, then where his friends and officers are euil. Nowe I will speake of the second im|perfection, whiche is couetousnesse, which being once entred into a Princes hearte, there is no mischiefe, cruelty, im|pietie, or wickednesse, whiche it will not perswade him too: yea euen to make sale of Offices and of Iustice, to fyle his handes with the vile gaine of some things, whiche very pri|uate persons would be ashamed to medle withal,  to seke to haue about him such fetching heads, who consume the~selues in a manner away, in deuising new kinds of extortion  pol|ling, and to set it forth with some goodly title. So that indued with this insatiable mind, he is alway ready to procure that the exchecker may be filled full, and the countrie emptied cleane. Of which fault it followeth, that he liuing alwayes miserable full of suspicion and feare, with a sword still han|ging by a heare ouer his head, hee taketh at one tyme from his subiects libertie, from himselfe safetie, from both tran|quillitie?


Guaz.
Nowe I will say you giue to an ill Prince that honour which is due vnto him, and I se not why we ought not as frely to blame the il, as to commend the good, whom God long preserue. But returning to the infirmitie of co|uetousnesse, I thinke it much more molesteth and tor|menteth the higher sorte, then the meaner or lower: and that many Princes haue ingrauen in their heartes the de|sire

of some kingdome, which when they haue obtained, yet neuerthelesse they are neuer the more satisfied, but grow stil in desire of some other: so that this saying may be verified in them, Alexander seemeth great to the worlde, but the world seemeth small to Alexander.


Annib.
In trueth Alexander ought to be counted poore, or rather wretched: for that he which is not content with that he hath, hath neuer a whit more, then hee, who hath nothing at all. That Prince then, which coueteth to bee well spoken off, and well thought off by his subiectes, wil take hede of those two faultes before named: and that (through his ignoraunce) when matters come in consulta|tion, hee may not sitte amongst his counsaylours, like a dumbe dogge, he will endeuour himselfe first, to lay holde of learning and wisdome: whereof he sheweth an vndoub|ted signe, in making account of those, who are learned and wise.


Guaz.
Arestinus being askt, why fewe Princes nowa|dayes extende their liberalitie to those that are excellent in Poetrie or other artes, as they were wont to doe in times past: answered, for that their conscience giueth the~ how vn|worthy they are of the prayses which by Poets are giuen vnto them: and for other artes, it is dayly sene, that a man maketh no account of that, which he knoweth not. There|fore I would in any wise haue a Prince learned, both for this and other causes, by you alleaged.


Annib.
Amongst all the learning mete for a Prince, that is the chiefest, which intreateth of matters of state and gouernment: And therefore it is sayde, that Demetrius ex|horted Ptolomey to reade many books pertaining to gouern|ment, for that there he should finde many thinges whiche his subiectes durst not tell him. Next, it behooueth a Prince to flye aboue all thinges, that before named, Couetousnesse, as the head of all mischiefe: not to suffer so vile and so vn|worthy a guest to lodge in his house, and to put off a priuate person, and put on a publike, referring all his cogitations

to the benefit of his people. Besides this, that he consider with himselfe, how heauily a Scepter and Crowne doe waygh, and if hee aspyre to the kingdome, in hope of a more secure life, hee immitateth him, who clymbeth to the toppe of a high hyll, in hope to saue himselfe from light|ning and tempest: wherevpon one with great reason tear|med the lyfe of a Prince, a glorious miserie: an other called it, a noble bondage: naming moreouer, a good king, a publike seruaunt. And Tiberius, (as I remember) named the Empiere, a great beast: Insomuch, that if euery man would ponder in his minde the paynes, the watchinges, the labours, the perilles, the vexations, and finally the weigh|tie charge a careful Prince is subiect to, it should not perhaps be sene, that two would striue and goe to war for one king|dome, but they would rather content themselues to be ru|led, then to rule: whervpon a wise prince knowing y^e waight and daunger of so heauy a burthen, which he alone for want of strength and knowledge is not able to beare, prouideth himselfe of officers and counsaylours, who are sene as well in ciuill, as marciall affayres, for the execution of Iustice, and conuersation of his own state: Remembring the Pro|uerbe, that an euill Prince, hath euill sides: that is, euill counsaylours. And therefore in making this choyce, he ta|keth good aduisement, prouiding so nere as he can, that they be endued with honestie and learning. Wherin Phillip, king of Macedon was so presise and circumspect, that onely ha|uing found out, that one of his officers died his beard, he put him forth of his office: sayinge, that hee coulde not bee true and faythfull in publike matters, who wrought tre|cherie with his owne beard. Besides, he will neuer con|clude any thing without their aduice, especially, when iustice is to be executed in any thing: remembring how it is sayde, that when Iupiter was minded to bestowe any benefit vpon mortal creatures, he did it of himselfe: but when hee was dis|posed to doe harme, either by lightning, tempest, warre, plague, earthquake, or such like, hee assembled the rest of

the Gods, and wrought his vengeance by their aduise. The Emperour Antonius also vsed to say, It is more met that I folow the counsaile of so many and such good friends, then to suffer all them to followe the fancie of me alone. A Prince likewise must indeuour to surmount his subiects, not in ydlenesse, but in industrie and forecast. And as the cele|stial things can not stande stil, but with continual moouing take force: so hee ought alway to exercise and trauaile him selfe in gouerning his subiects with iustice, and in looking to their welfare and profite, in such sorte, that he fulfil the say|ing of the Emperour Adrian, which was, that a kingdome was to be vsed as a thing belonging to the people, not to the Prince himselfe. Furthermore, let him be sure to get y^e good wil of his subiects, which is the sure  inexpugnable stre~gth of a realme, which good wil hee shal get, folowing the opini|on of Titus Vespasianus, shewing himselfe suche towardes his subiectes, as he coueteth to haue them towardes him. And as there is nothing more hurtfull then to be hated, so is there nothing more helpefull then to be loued. Which no doubt is gotten with gentlenesse and curtesie, and therefore no meruayle though that Vespasian by a generall consent were called the iewell of the world, and the darling of man|kind, for that he was alwayes ready to giue audience to all men, and not to suffer any to depart out of his sight vnsatis|fied.


Guaz.
There is no other thing in trueth that maketh the golden world, but the goodnesse of Princes.


An.
A prince must not only shew himself curteous, affa|ble,  gratious, in co~uersing w^t his subiects, but besides, must vse his autority modestly, especially in offences co~mitted a|gainst himselfe: wherin it ought to suffice him that he might haue taken vengeance: and to imitate those mighty  stro~g beasts, which neuer turne againe against litle curres which run barking after them. Remembring the saying of Cato, that the mighty ought to vse their power moderately, that they may vse it continually. Wherevppon Traiane vsed to call the Senate Father, and him selfe their seruant.

But to vse a worde for all, we will say, that a good Prince ought to purchase to him selfe the name of the father of his Countrie, and not to beare himselfe otherwise towardes his subiectes, then a father doeth towards his sonnes. And for so much as out of the example of Cyrus in Xenephon, and of many others, may be perfectly gathered the precepts pertei|ning to a Prince, it shalbe enough for vs to adde to that wee haue alredy spoken, these thre rules: that is, that the Prince make himselfe well thought of by speaking soberly, that he shewe his bounty, in forbearing from polling his subiects, and his wisedome in gouerning himselfe discreetely. And that Prince which shall obserue these rules, may iustly say, that he is the liuely Image of God: as on the contrary, he may assure himselfe, that if no mishap befall him in his life, he shall fele in his death this saying verified, That the mightie shalbe mightily tormented. Nowe let vs come to subiectes, and their conuersation with Princes, which (spea|king of Princes in generall) I haue alwayes thought that subiectes ought to auoide so muche as they may, for that the good will of Princes kindleth vppon a heate, and vpon a so|den, but it is by and by blowne foorth againe with the winde of enuy, or slaunder, which is proued by the example of Lys|miacus and Scianus, who were so farre in fauour, the one with Alexander, the other with Tiberius: who neuerthelesse fell from their high fauour, into most foule disgrace and de|struction. Yea, and without fetching so farre, we se at this day many of the like chaunces. And though there be nowe and then some one which mainteineth himselfe still in credite, and yet the poore soule alwayes liueth with an vn|quiet mind, and his maister doth continually loade him like a good horse, with some burden or other, and neuer leaueth vntill he haue quite tyred him, so that he findeth that say|ing true, That whether thy Prince loue the, or hate the, it is all one euill. Wherevpon I thinke not amisse to followe the fable of the earthen vessell, whiche in no wise woulde haue the company of the brasen vessell. And you know wel, that in their companie a man cannot vtter his minde frely

nor doe any thing contrarie to their pleasure: if he doe, he shalbe no friende of Caesars.


Guaz.
The conuersation of Princes in my iudgement is not to be auoided, in any other respect, but for that it ta|keth away that libertie, which is so acceptable in company, and bringeth vs into a certaine kinde of bondage, which we cannot lie of long, but we must consider on the other side, howe much the being in the Princes companie doeth coun|tenance vs, howe thereby wee take away occasion for men to thinke that through basenesse of minde, we abandon the Courte: what honour and profite we often reape thereby, and what contentation and pleasure it is to vs to be admit|ted into our Princes presence, yea, to be in the company and sight of such a Saint, as you spake of erewhile, I think most heauenly happinesse.


Annib.
You haue preuented me right: for I meant to adde, that though this conuersation be daungerous,  that I myself especially neuer sought to enter into it, yet being well vsed, bringeth estimation  profite. Besides, that the Prince excelling vs so much in vertue  valour, by how much he is aboue vs in degre, it is also to be thought, that his company auaileth greatly to our edification in vertue  goodnes. Like as the example of the Prince you but now mentioned, hath made such vertuous, learned,  acco~plished Courtiers, that there is not a more florishing or famous Court in y^e worlde. But you are not ignorant, that some, not vnlike the earthen vessels, are broke~ by leading their life with Princes, because they doe not behaue the~selues as behooueth them. And there|fore, for their welfare and securitie, I briefly prescribe vnto them, that they be not puft vp with pride  vaine glory, nor beare them neuer the bolder for the fauour and good counte|nance of the Prince: but rather, the more they are exalted, to shew the more humilitie and reuerence.


Guaz.
I like that wel, for I haue noted, that the Duke my maister hath withdrawne his fauour fro~ some, who haue abused his goodnes towards then, whereby their fall was so much y^e greater, by how much before they were placed high|er. And truely I know by proofe, that he which will long in|ioy

the fauour of his Prince, must like the Beare, infane wether, be sad to think of the soule that is to come: whiche doubtfull thought, will kepe him in such humilitie  lowly|nesse as Princes like of.


Annib.
A Man cannot possibly behaue himselfe to reue|rently towards them. And though it be reported, that when Aristippus could not be heard of Dionisius, he threw himself down at his fet, saying, the fault is not mine, that I commit this idolatrie, but the kings, who hath his eares in his fete: yet perhaps it might haue ben replied to Aristippus, that the fault was his, for y^t without vsing due reuerence, he woulde be chek mate with the Prince. But let vs end this matter, charging euery one what soeuer he be, to reuerence  obey his Prince with all humilitie, for that y^e honour is not giuen to him, but to God him selfe, whose minister he is. And what is saide of Princes, is to be vnderstoode also of Magi|strates, not regarding that there are amongest them, whiche are vniust, cruell, partiall, ignorant, corrupt, respectours of persons c. but hauing respect to this, that they are the members of the Prince.


Guaz.
Yet I woulde gladly haue you discend to some particuler point belonging to Magistrates: to whom I think ther are necessarily some seueral rules to be prescribed, diffe|rent from those you set downe to Princes, and so muche the rather, for that some of them touching their dealinges may be amended.


Annib.
The hurt certainely is inestimable, that com|meth by an yll Magistrate, and therefore it is saide, That a Swoorde is put into a mad mans hand, when an office is be|stowed vpon a naughty person, who is commonly called an Ape in purple. Whervpon we are to aduertise Magistrates, that as touching their calling, they be charitable in correc|ting, vpright in iudging, and mercifull in punishing. And I would haue those which begin to growe proude by reason of their preferment, to remember the example of that Asse, whiche bearing the image of the Goddesse Tsides, on his backe, and seing that euery one whiche met him, kneled downe, and did adoration vnto him, entred into great

pride, and perswaded himselfe, that that honour was doone to him. Into the selfe same errour, some Magistrates fal, who seing themselues saluted and honoured of euery man, imagine that themselues deserue that honour: Not percei|uing that for the most part, that honour is not done in respect of any desert of theirs, but in reuerence of the Prince, whose image they beare in their head. Nay rather Magistrates in stede of being honoured rightly, and for their owne sakes, very often receiue (as the Prouerbe is) winde in a net: and taste meate seasoned rather with smoke then with salt.


Guaz.
They may well say with our Lord, The peo|ple honoureth me with their lippes, but their hearte is farre from mee.


Annib.
It is the saying of a wise man, That he that sitteth worthily in the seate, doeth honour to the seate: but he that sitteth vnworthily, shameth it. And therefore a dis|crete Magistrate ought not to take vpon him bigly, or to al|ter his manners in respect of his dignitie, which he shall not be sure alwaies to inioy: but so to vse the matter, that hee may be respected and honoured, not in respect of his office, but of the good partes which are in himselfe, to the ende that when he shalbe out of office, he may say that he remaineth in honour, without the honour. And touching his conuersa|tion with the Prince, this is enough for him, that neither for feare nor hope, he consent at any time to any thing that is vniust: neither to ful fill his peruerse humour any way. But if it bee a greuous fault to consent to the disordinate desires of the Prince, it is much worse to put naughtie mat|ters into his head, when he before thought not of them, and to stirre him vp to wrath, too cruelty, to vengeance, to extor|tion, and such like.


Guaz.
Yea, but by your leaue, those are the officers which continue longest in fauour.


Annib.
Yea, but where the Prince is wise and vertu|ous, you shall most commonly se such fellowes leaue their hyre, yea and their hide too behinde them, and ende their dayes most miserably and shamefully. The last aduertise|ment

to be giuen to officers in respect of priuate persons is, that he shewe himselfe in countenance seuere and terri|ble, which maketh the guiltie afearde  the guiltlesse bolde, which commonly pleaseth the good, and displeaseth the yll, and that he bee patient to heare euery man, but especially the poore, neither y^t hee be lesse liberall of iustice, or quicke in dispatche towards them, then towardes the riche and migh|tie. But alas, couetousnesse and ambition beare such sway, that in the iudgement place, the offence of the riche is sooner defended, then the innocencie of the poore: and pardoning the crowes, pigeons are punished. But for that the time pas|seth away, let vs passe to speake of the conuersation betwen the learned, and the ignorant. *


Guaz.
I thinke it a matter impossible, for you to tune this later sort in suche sort, that they may bee accepta|ble in company to the other sort.


Annib.
Wherevpon grounde you that opinion?


Guaz.
Upon the example of water and waxe, which by no meanes may bee incorporated together: I meane, vppon the too great diuersitie of their nature and disposition. You se, that the learned are seldome or neuer in the company of the vnlearned: knowing wel that men make no account of that which they knowe not. And thereof arose the fable of the Cock finding a precious stone, which he set lesse by the~ a barly corne.


Annib.
It is an ordinary saying, that ignorance is a kinde of folly. And therefore I woulde haue you consider with me, that there are in the worlde two sortes of the ig|norant: the one foolishe, the other wise. I call foolishe igno|rant, those who are not onely rude of vnderstanding, and voide of learning, but also haue in hatred and disdaine all those who are wise and learned: and like naturall fooles iudge all those to be fooles, and scoffe at them, whiche make profession of learning: counting themselues happy in that they knowe nothing, and alwayes perseuering in that er|rour. By reason whereof, those who are learned, haue reason to flye their companie. For to reason of learning amongst

larned the honour which is due vnto them, but I thinke it met to confesse, that the learned are as the staffe and stay to the weake and feble: and that of all the things whiche we possesse in this world, only learning is perpetuall  immor|tall, and therefore I take great pitie of those who haue not the good hap to haue it. And it may very truely be saide, that it is not so muche commendation to a man to be lear|ned, as it is shame to be vnlearned. Learning no doubt taketh from a man ignorance, learning directeth him in the course of his life, learning maketh him acceptable to all me~, learning is an ornament to him in prosperitie,  a comforte in aduersitie: finally, learning sifting him from the dregges and filth of the common people, serueth him as a ladder to climbe to honours and dignities,  raiseth him from earth|ly vanities, to the contemplation of thinges Celestiall and diuine.


Guaz.
You attribute so much to the honour of lear|ning, that you seme to forget the commendation due to armes: whiche (as you knowe) is able to weigh with it, in any grounde in Italy.


Annib.
I am not ignorant, that a personage of account being asked whether he had rather be Achilles or Homer, made answere, Tell me thou thy selfe, whether thou hadst rather be a Trumpetter, or a Captaine? But though this answere make for armes, yet I pray you tell mee what you thinke to be the end and marke that wise and worthie men shoote at?


Guaz.
I thinke it be to leaue behinde them that, which may triumphe ouer death, and according to the saying of the Poet.

May fetch a man foorth of his graue,
and keepe him still aliue.



Annib.
You say well: but whereof dependeth this im|mortalitie and euerliuing name?


Guaz.
Of learning, and histories, whereby it is con|serued for euer.


Annib.
You may se then, that learning is aboue armes,

for that learning of it selfe is able to purchase immortalitie: but armes cannot doe it without the aide of learning: which Alexander the great knew well enough, who calling Achil|les happie, for that it was his hap to haue so excellent a setter foorth of his doings, woulde say no more, but that he desired likewise to light vpon one, who with the like grace, woulde gather into one booke, his trauelles, conquests, and renow|med Acts: which without some suche excellent wit, to com|mend them to posteritie, he knew would soone be buried in obliuion.


Guaz.
I thinke verily, that without some spurre of euerlasting praise, fewe men woulde be pricked forward to enterprise any thing worthie praise.


Annib.
We all couet this glory, as the fruite and law|full reward of our trauell: and there is no man but is right glad to co~secrate his name to immortalitie. For proofe wher|of it is tolde that a certaine writer published in print a little pamphlet of his owne making, intituled, The contempt of glory, wherein by many notable reasons, he indeuoured to prooue that it is a vanitie vnsemely for a man to gape after glory, in consideration of his owne works. But that writer was afterwards charged to haue committed the same fault, which he found fault with in others, for that hee had set his name in the first page and beginning of his booke. Whereby it was apparantly knowne, that if hee had contemned glory in dede, as he went about to perswade others by wordes, he would haue caused his book to haue ben imprinted without his name, whiche being blazed in the fore front as it was, gaue a manifest signe, how desirous he was of glory: but Ci|cero would neuer dissemble in that point, who in a long let|ter, ope~ly, and earnestly requested Luceius to gratifie him in thre thinges: The first, that he would set downe separately from his other histories, the conspiracy of Cateline, therby to giue immortall fame to his name: the second, that he woulde add some thing in respect of the fre~dship which was betwene them. The third, that he would publish his book with al sped possible, that while he were yet liuing, he might taste of the

swetenesse of his owne glory. I will not here let passe Au|gustus, who ioyned to his last will and Testament his owne acts pece by pece, appointing that they shoulde bee ingrauen vpon his tombe in pillers of brasse. But how many other may a man rehearse, who went canuassing about, and cra|uing for this bruite,  this glory, by the meane either of histo|ries, or of images, or of tombes, or of pictures, or of buil|dinges, or other memorials.


Guaz.
It semeth a greater maruell to me, that so ho|nourable a desire should enter into the hearte of a common Courtisan, named Trine, who being very rich, suche time as Alexander the great razed the walles of Thebes, went and profered the Thebanes to repaire them at her owne char|ges, so that they would be content that, to her euerlasting fame, she might cause only these wordes to be ingrauen in the wall: Alexander razed it, and Trine raised it.


Annib.
This woman was better to be borne withal, who sought glory with her owne money, then some are, who get it at other mens cost, and being not able to leaue behinde the~ a good report by help of their owne vertue, attribute thee|uishly to themselues the doings of strangers, of which sorte of men, it is not long since that wee vsed some speeche. Tou|ching armes, I reply that the dedes of famous Captaines  worthie souldiers die with them, if they haue not some to set them foorth in writing, or vnlesse they haue ioyned to their prowesse in armes, the knowledge of good letters. So that by the example of Caesar, they may be able to hold the speare in the rest with one hand, and with the other the pen to write their own acts, which were very necessary, especially in these our dayes, wherein the memory of diuers worthy souldiers, yea, Princes  Gentlemen, who haue atchieued many vali|ant exploites, hath ben lost,  is yet from time to time lost. Whereas if they had ben so wel set foorth as y^e famous men were in time past, they should neuer haue had cause to haue enuied the glory of Annibal, Marcellus, Caesar, or y^e Scipios, but had ben equal to them in euery respect.


Guaz.
Hereby may be gathered how profitable the con|uersatio~

of the learned men is,  how important it is to haue the friendship  familiaritie of writers: who with one drop or two of ynke, may prolong our life through many ages.


Annib.
They haue power not only to prolong life, but to abridge it. And therevpon a certain Captaine vsed to say, that the pennes of writers, pearce the souldiers corslets. We know wel how diuers writers either to please others, either led by affection, or moued vpon some other occasion, haue in their histories, contrary to their duety, magnified  exalted a|boue the trueth, the doings of some captaines,  abased or els concealed the notable enterprises of other some, and by the force of their hand and penne, haue lift vp the litle and thrust downe the great.


Guaz.
Touching that, I remember that P. Iouius being blamed for the infidelitie of his historie, he could not deny it, saying yet that he comforted himselfe, knowing that when a hundred yeres were once expired, there would be no man li|uing that could gainsay his writing, so y^t the posteritie shold be driuen of necessitie to giue vndoubted credite vnto them.


Annib.
Perchaunce he would not haue put himselfe in that hazard if he had not made his account by the maiestie  elegancie of his history, to make al the writers of this time afeard to write against him *. But as y^e world goeth, those shew themselues wise men, whiche kepe the learned their friends,  which receiue them into their fauour and protecti|on: not so much for their owne behoofe, as for the loue of ver|tue, which thing brought great glory to Alexander, to Au|gustus,  to Mecenas, who bestowed honours  maruellous rewards vpon diuers Gramarians, Orators, Poets,  phi|losophers. Neither thinke I met to let passe the example of Pius y^e seconde, who in the warres of his time gaue expresse co~mandement that y^e honor, goods,  life of the people of Ar|pines should be spared, in the reme~brance of Tully, who was that countrie man, and for y^t there were many there liuing, which bore his name *. But it is good to set downe some forme of conuersation to the learned,  to put the~ in remem|bra~ce in the first place, y^e learning maketh a man glorious 

haughtie, * which is confirmed by Accius the Poet, who tooke so bigly vpon him, by reason of his learning, that Caesar the Emperour entring into the colledge of Poets, he would not vouchsafe to salute him, thinking himselfe better then him. I truely was euer of this minde, that as a tre, the more it is taken with fruit, the more it bendeth to y^e ground: so a man, the more hee is stored with learning, the more he ought to humble himselfe. For that the grounde of true vertue is humilitie: neither is any mans name so bright, but that by pride it is obscured. * And therefore the learned ought neither to hide their knowledge without fruite, neither to shew it vpon vaine glory, but for their pro|fite and preferment. They ought also to conforme their life to their learning, for that knowledge is no better in a naughtie man, then good wine put into a mustie vessell. They ought likewise to imploy their learning to the benefite of others, and to make others partakers of it. For that a man doeth not possesse pleasantly any good thing without companie, so that they ought to take paines to instruct o|thers, in that they themselues are skilfull in: and they must begin to learne to teach.


Guaz.
I thinke it also conuenient for the learned in conuersation and company, to take hede of affectation, whereby they make themselues rather disliked then com|mended.


Annib.
I meant euen nowe to haue told you, that that same is the errour of some learned men, who being in the co~|pany of the vnlearned, take delight to speake amongst them like a maister that readeth to his schollers, and as if they were in the middest of learned men and Philosophers, they make argumentes in moode and figure, and discourse with tearmes, which are onely vnderstoode of the learned: and thereby they offend the eares, and turne the mindes of the hearers from giuing attention to their talke. A man ought then especially amongest the ignorant to vse suche familiar kind of learning,  with such discretion, y^t it may serue rather for sauce to get the~ a stomack, then for meate to fil  cloy the~,

so that the vnlearned may haue in detestation their owne ignorance, and in admiration his knowledge.


Guaz.
He that shall knowe howe to keepe this way, which you haue proposed, shall no doubt giue and receiue great coontentment in the company of the ignorant, who without any difficultie will allowe of that he shall say, and haue him in great honour for it.


Annib.
One saide, that as some ships seme great vp|pon the ryuer, whiche shewe very little vppon the Sea: so some seeme learned amongest the ignorant, whiche haue but a little when they come amongest the learned. And it can not bee denied, but that in all companies, hee ruffleth most, and taketh pleasure to vtter that which is in him, who kno|weth him selfe to be chiefe and best seene in the matter whiche is spoken of. But for all that, he must not perswade himselfe that he ought not to heare the vnlearned speake, or to make any reckoning of them: For that there are men to be found, who though they be not indued with learning, yet they haue a good wit of their owne, and are able to com|passe their matters well enough, and bring them to a good ende: insomuch that many, who are learned, seme but fooles in respect of them. Like as a scholler came to an artificer, to craue his deuotion, saying, That he was maister in the vij. Artes. But the Artificer answered him, I am more lear|ned then thou art, for that with one Art only, I nourishe my selfe, my wife, and children, where as thou canst not kepe thy selfe alone with seuen.


Guaz.
Now I pray you giue the ignorant some instruc|tions, whereby they may in conuersation get the fauour of the learned.


Annib.
We haue alredy, if you remember in the beginning of our discourse, inioyned vnto them silence, as a most singuler thing, whiche neuerthelesse they kepe very yll. For that in company, if you marke it, those whiche knowe least, speake, contend, and crie the lowdest. Whereof belike ariseth this Prouerbe, That the brokenest wheele of the charriot maketh alwaies the greatest noyse.



Guaz.
A man might contrariwise apply another Pro+uerbe to the learned, That where the ryuer is deepest, it run|neth quietest.


Annib.
The second aduise is, that being in the compa|ny of the learned, they remember that they are vnlearned. For by that meanes they will be wary what they speake: for it is the saying of a Philosopher, that he neuer offendeth in those things he knoweth not, who knoweth that he doeth not knowe them. And contrariwise he is ignorant and doth amisse, who thinketh he knoweth, that he doeth not know. Thirdly, they are to be aduertised, that amongst the degres of superioritie before spoken of, this is one, that the wise commaund ouer the ignorant: whereas it is their part to be silent without standing obstinately in contention: for that there is nothing in this world more odious then an ignorant person, which will contend with the learned, like as the Pie did with the Nightingale in musicke. And therefore as it is the part of one that is learned, gently to impart to the igno|rant that which he knoweth, so is it the part of the ignorant to ask, without hiding his ignorance, that which he knoweth not,  rather to confes not to know, the~ to professe to know: for the one is a signe of modestie, the other of arrogancie.


Guaz.
It were not amisse, yet to vse a little skil in con|fessing the want of skill, that it turn not to our open shame. But it were no great matter, if one did like a good gentlema~ of our countrie, whom a stranger asked what history it was that was painted about his hall: the Gentleman saide, stay here I pray you a little,  I will returne to you by  by, that said, he went hastily to the study of a brother of his, who was a Doctour,  bringing him with him into the hall where the stranger was, he saide vnto him, brother, I pray you make answere vnto this Gentleman.


Annib.
But perhaps it wil be a hard matter to finde in euery house so much as one, who with his wisedome is able to supply others ignorance. But let vs return to say that the ignorant ought to honour the learned, and to seke theyr companie, which wil make them more politike, more wis,

and more vertuous. For if you marke it, those whiche are vnlearned, lightly giue them selues too dishonest doings: for seing that they cannot get the fauour of the Prince nor any preferment any way, for lacke of learning and ver|tue, they indeuour to set vp themselues, either by flatterie, either by promoting, either by laundering, or by false ac|cusing, and other naughtie meanes, whiche those that are learned, will neuer lightly vse: but enough of this. And for that we saide but erewhile, that the learned receiueth great contentment in the companie of the vnlearned, let vs nowe consider howe little that contentment is in respect of that whiche he receiueth being in the companine of his like: For no doubt a learned man taketh much more pleasure in the company of the learned, who know, yea, and allowe better of his learning, then in the company of the ignorant, who vnderstande it not so well, neither are able to iudge of it. Besides, when he is amongest the ignorant, he taketh pleasure only in that which he himselfe giueth. But when he is with the learned, he delighteth both in it, which he gi|ueth,  that he receiueth: for that by turnes he doeth both teach and learne. Moreouer, he hath a nother contentment, to know that where is greatest conformitie in estate, in life and in study, there is greatest agrement in good will and a|mitie, and consequently greater pleasure and contentment, * yea, that effect is bred among the~, which is found amongst flowers, which being separated one from another giue a good smell, but being bounde together in a posie, they recreate the spirites a great deale more, like as it was well saide by a Poet,
Two good men ioyned together, doe
in goodnesse more excel:
And roses ioyned with lielies haue,
a great deale sweeter smell.
Yea, it is a Philosophers saying, that one in comparison of two is no bodie. * And truely amongest all other com|panies, and societies, there is not any more firmely and

nerely linked together, then this of the learned: who for the most part loue better amongest themselues, then kins|folke and brethren doe: agreeing in like studies, and like affections, they can not but take pleasure one in another, and reduce them selues from the number of many as it were into one vnited body.


Guaz.
All other assemblies may be well termed strange and externall, and this same familiar and internal, where|in the mindes are exercised in reasoning, teaching, and dis|coursing of things, which appertaine to the knowledge of vertue and goodnesse. And these are the true freendships, which last long.


Annib.
It is a common saying, that the bondes of vertue binde more straightly, then the bondes of blood. And in trueth one good man may be sayd to be a nere kins|man to another good man, by the conformitie of their minds and manners. *


Guaz.
Hereby I imagine how great the concorde, the pleasure,  the profit is, which is reaped by the Academie of the illustratie (as they tearme them) established in this citie.


Annib.
You are deceiued in your imagination, for this Academy being assembled in the name of God, you may well thinke, that he is in the midst of them, and that hee mainteineth it in peace and amitie. What comfort euery one receiueth by it, I cannot sufficiently set foorth vnto you: for that I haue tried in my selfe and seene plainely in other Academikes, that there is not any one so afflicted with the common miseries of this citie, and with his priuate trou|bles, who setting once his foote into the hal of the Academie, seemeth not to ariue at the hauen of tranquilitie, and begin|neth not to clere his minde of care: casting his eyes about the hall to see those goodly deuises, full of profounde myste|ries. I may well say of my selfe, that when my bodie is shut within it, all my yrkesome thoughtes are shut out: the which attend me at the doore, and at my going out get vp|pon my shoulders, but touching the good which commeth

of his happie assembly, you may be assured in thinking to your selfe what diuersitie of learning is there handled, sometimes with publike lectures, sometimes with priuate reasoninges, which breede that delight, which commeth of giuing and receiuing, as we haue sayde before. And I may say without arrogancie that the Academie, borrowing me as it were to reade in Philosophie, hath payed mee home with interrest, being not onely bettered in that parte, but also moued with some knowledge in diuinitie, poetrie, and other laudable sciences, whereof I knowe I am not al|together voide.


Guaz.
I haue noted by long experience, that for the most parte those are smally accounted of, in companie, which haue bestowed al their studie in one onely profession: For drawing them once out of that, you shall finde them very sottes and fooles. Whereas on the contrary, those are very well thought of, who besides their chiefe profession are able to discourse reasonablie well and with discretion of other matters: In so much that the knowledge they shew in those bye matters, bringeth them so much the more ho|nour, by how much they are estraunged from their ordina|ry profession. Wherefore seeing in companie wee com|monly deuise of diuerse thinges, leaping from one matter into another, there is nothing, in my iudgement, that doeth vs more honour, or maketh vs better liked of, in good com|panie, then to be readie at all assayes, and haue a mouth for euery matter: to be able to perfourme which, I consi|der that the companie of many learned men is very auaile|able, like as that of the Academies is.


Annib.
We haue alredie sayde that it is not in one man to speake sufficiently of all thinges, by reason of the shortenesse of his lyfe, but for so much as all learning is not in one alone, it is good that manie assemble togeather to make amongest them one perfect man, as it falleth out in those learned companies.


Guaz.
Seeing the conuersation of these Academikes is so auayleable, I looke you shoulde set downe some orders

for them, which they ought to obserue, to mainteine them|selues long in agrement and amitie.


Annib.
I should thinke I should commit a fault if I should speake any thing of that, for that it were according too the Prouerb to instruct Minerua: knowing that it is in them ra|ther to teach, then to be taught the orders of conuersation. Besides that, they haue lawes and orders set downe in wri|ting, by force whereof, friendship and concord is inuiolably kept amongest them.


Guaz.
I pray you yet at the least, to tell and recount vn|to me the order of the Academie of the illustrati in this ci|tie, and to declare vnto me the originall of it, and what is the manner of their conuersation together.


Annib.
If I should throughly satisfie your request, this day would not be enough to doe it, but to content you some|what, I briefly say vnto you that these Academikes desirous to trauayle continually for their owne glorie,  the vniuer|sall benefite, haue proposed vnto themselues the enterprise of the sunne, which going out of the Horizon, ascendeth to the opposite of the moone, which setteth in the West, and vpon this deuise, are set these wordes. Lux indeficiens, with the name of Illustrati.. The lawes of the Academie are a great manie, but they are referred al, chiefly to the honour of God, and conseruation of the state of the Academie. In proposing of matters, in discoursing and in answering, they procede with great respect and reuerence, without tumult, without confusion. And in giuing of voyces euery one preferreth his auncient before him, as touching priuate congregations, some are called for the creation of the Prince, Counsellours, Censors, and other Officers: who are made by secrete voy|ces, and they continue but from foure monethes to foure. Some to heare the discourse of some Academike, who lo|ueth not to doe it publikely: some to admit the newe Aca|dmikes that were before chosen by priuie voyces: and to to heare their speches, wherein they render thankes too the Prince and the Academikes. Some to conferre of those

thinges which are to be handled in publike: and then there are ordinarily made lectures and discourses of diuers mat|ters, and by two Academikes the compositions and workes of the Academie are redde, and afterwardes the writinges and doynges of strangers. Euery two monethes they change their Prince, and in that ceremonie, the olde Prince geueth vp his throne and deliuereth the seale of the Academie too his successour, who placing himselfe in the others seate, ta|keth possession of the principalitie: which is done in euerie point with such state and maiestie, that I am not able to ex|presse it. Which you may imagine by the great multitude, not onely of Citizens, but of straungers, which are present at it. Moreouer, it happeneth sometime, that some Acade|mike is married, and then the bride and other gentlewomen with her, are inuited to this assemblie: where she is honou|red with great pompe and solemnity, with pleasant discour|ses, with commendatorie verses, with musicke  such like. Like as my Ladie Francis your cosin was, to whom in o|pen assembly there was geuen in the name of the Aca|demikes a Carcanet of golde, which you may perhaps haue sene about her necke, whereon the one side, is brauely set foorth, the deuise or armes of the Acacademie: and on the o|ther side, the deuise of your brother: but something altered, for whereas that hath a flying swan, with a branche of bay in her mouth,  this writing on it (aboue the skies) this hath besides the shadow of the same swan, and he posie is chan|ged, which is (Be a mate in this maner) meaning that she ought to follow the steps of her husband, as the shadowe did the swanne, They vse also at the death of any of the Acade|mikes to make funerall assemblies, in honour of him with such grauitie and sadnesse that it is woonderfull. I coulde re|hearse vnto you many other notable thinges, but I will o|mit them for the time is short, which we haue to bestowe in other matters, wee will onelye say then, that the con|uersation with the learned standeth vs in maruellous steede, delighteth vs muche, and is the cause of greate loue and amity. Which is shewed by the able of Narcissus,

who being without company, so soone as he sawe himselfe in a fountaine, fel in loue with himself: and therfore nothing being more like vnto vs, then our Image, it may be well sayde, that when one that is learned loueth an other that is learned, that both of them loue nothing els, but their owne Image in an other. And it may be likewise saide, that this their friendship is perpetual, as well as the loue of ones selfe is. Nowe let vs come to the conuersation betwene stran|gers and Citizens.


Guaz.
Seing we haue but a litle time left, it were bette to omitte this matter, as a thing little and seldome hap|pening.


Annib.
Let vs at least shewe vnto the Citizen, that it is his part to haue a pittifull eye towardes straungers, and to consider, that being farre from their countrey, parentes and goodes, being depriued of all those commodities which wee inioy in our owne houses, they are to be succoured with all ayde and fauour possible, and especially those, which are in necessitie: For no doubt, he that receiueth them into his lod|ging, purchaseth to himself a lodgeing and abyding place in heauen, by meanes of his charitable curtesie: yea we must knowe, that this worke is so acceptable to God, that he that giueth onely a cuppe of colde water to drinke, in the way of charitie, shall not goe without rewarde And though the commodities here belowe are not to bee compared with the heauenly rewardes, yet let vs thinke what honour and pro|fit the good enterteinement which we giue to straungers bringeth vs: for that those, which kepe open house for stran|gers, doe not onely winne credit in their owne countrey, but without setting foote out of the precinct of their owne terry|torie, they are known, and honourably reported of in forrain countries: besides that, they are sure, when they trauayle, to finde friendes, money, and succour at nede.


Guaz.
It is a great contentment to a man, to se himself estemed, and made much off by his parentes and friends, in his owne countrey: but that is but a trifle in respect of the good it doeth a man, when he seth himselfe entertained

and honoured, where he is scare knowen. And therfore you shall easily perswade mee to performe this duetie towardes strangers, towards whom I feele my selfe maruellously wel affected, for that in my trauayle. I receiued at their handes great curtesie.


Annib.
For that cause I was about to tell you, that those shew themselues most hoggish and cruell to strangers, who neuer went out of their countrie: Who for that they haue not felt the inconueniences, and discommodities of tra|uell, haue no consideration of the state of strangers, neyther are moued with any compassion towardes them. Wherein they are greatly too blame, for that they ought too shewe to strangers more curtesie  honour, then to their owne coun|triemen. Being the saying of a Philosopher that a stranger when he is depriued of his friendes and parentes, is to be pitied both of God and men. And therefore being in compa|nie with them, we ought to vse great respect towards them, both in dede and word, forbearing finding of faultes, and o|ther boldnesse, which we might lawfully vse towardes our owne countriemen, yea, and to cloake and to beare rather with their imperfections. So that some are of this opinion, that we ought not to deale yll with strangers, though they deserue it.


Guaz.
It is very true, but yet oftentimes straungers are worse vsed, then they should be by theyr owne fault, whe~ they will be of housholde with vs in a manner, and be more familiar  bolde, then they ought to be, which maketh them fare the woorse.


Annib.
And therefore it shalbe the part of a straunger, being in another mans house, not to take vpo~ him presump|tuously, but to behaue himselfe so modestly, that euery man may loue and fauour him For as if he set himselfe forward too muche, he shalbe pulled backe with shame: so if hee hang backe, he shalbe halled forwarde with honour. He must also in companie vse the same behauiour in worde and dede towardes you, as you are bound to doe towards him: wherby your conuersation may be acceptable on both sides.

It remaineth to speake of the Conuersation betwene the se|culer and the religious.


Guaz.
You may haue soone done if you will, seing that nowe a dayes this Conuersation happeneth but one day in the yere, and of that day but one halfe houre only, which is spent in confessing our sinnes: which done, we not only flie the Conuersation, but the verie presence of our ghostly fa|ther.


Annib.
To whom impute you the fault of this sildome conuersation, to the religious, or to the lay people


Guaz.
It can not be ascribed to the religious (for they sek both vs and ours) but to vs, who flie from them.


Annib.
And why thinke you, we flie from them?


Guaz.
The Deuill belike persuadeth vs not to come at them, nor to haue them in any reuerence or honour, because some of them are sprinckled with some imperfecti|ons.


Annib.
It was demanded of a Pope, whether it were lawefull for Priestes nowe a dayes to minister the Sacra|ment in woodden Chalices, as they did in times past: who answered nothing els, but that in olde time golden Priestes ministred in woodden Chalices, and nowe woodden Priestes minister in golden Chalices. To like effect is this say|ing, That there is in the worlde scarcitie of Priestes, and plentie of Priestes, that is, too many in the bare name, too fewe that rightly execute the office. But it ought to suffice vs to knowe, that they haue the name and the true calling of Ministers, and that God hath giuen them vnto vs, not that we should be iudges of their dooinges, but folowers of their doctrine. And those which like not their company, no doubt offend greatly, and suffer to enter into their mindes the wic|ked spirite, enemy to religion, and the Christian fayth. But true Christians can not denie, but that the company of the religious is greatly auaileable: For that by their doctrine they kepe vs in the right way, and by their outwarde gra|uitie

only they giue vs an example to doe well. I for my parte, neuer yet met with any of the Ministery carry|ing so euill a report, or leading so lewde a life, but that by his company, I was rather stirred then stayed from wel do|ing: And I haue alwayes been of this minde, that nothing but good can happen vnto him whiche frequenteth their company. We must then leaue it to God to iudge of their life, and being amongest them, we ought to forbeare all lewde speches and behauiour, whereby their godly eares may be offended, and GOD him selfe dishonoured, and to haue them in continuall reuerence and honour: * For|so muche as they are the messengers of GOD, and bring the glad tydinges of the Gospell vnto vs. Yea, and are termed in holie scripture the sault of the earth, the light of the worlde, a Candle vppon a Candlesticke, giuing light to all whiche are in the house of GOD, a picked sede, a holie nation, and finally, Starres and Angelles. So that all the honour and reuerence we doe to them, we may a|sure our selues is done to GOD himselfe. * You are not ignoraunt on the other side, that the duetie of the Cler|gie is, in conuersing with the laytie, to beware howe they so muche as speake any thing tending to euill example, or giuing suspition of an yll disposed minde. Remembring the saying, That the vaine woordes of temporall men, are mere blasphemies in the mouth of spirituall men. * And before they goe about to infourme other in godlinesse, they must refourme them selues from naughtinesse: For it is in vaine to goe about to make the shadowe straite, if the bo|die whiche giueth the shadowe be crooked. They must also in teaching and reprehending, be neither too sharpe nor too gentle, but tempered betwene the rodde and the staffe: with the one to strike vs, with the other to stay vs. * They ought also by their good life  doctrine to amend our naughtie liues, and to stir vs vp to reuerence them, by shewing them selues more deuout, more iust, more faultlesse, then vs, for there is nothing that doth more dishonor the church of God,

then that Laymen are for the most part of better life  con|uersation, then spiritual men are.


Guaz.
If I remember the diuision which you made of the kinds of Conuersation, there remayneth no more for vs to speake of, but the conuersation with women.


Annib.
It was very mete this discourse should bee re|serued to the end, to refreshe vs beeing wery with the long iourney we haue gone this day.


Guaz.
I doubt me, that deuising of this conuersation in stede of refreshment, we shall fele greater trauell and torment, or els I most say, that your taste differeth much from mine, for that I haue alwayes thought the conuer|sation of women, not onely vayne and vnprofitable, but daungerous and hurtfull: and if you fele anye spi|rite in you, repugnaunt too this my opinion, coniure it, and driue it out of you by the vertue of thre nota|ble sentences. The first is, that if the worlde coulde bee mayteined without women, we shoulde liue like GOD himselfe. The seconde, that there is nothing in the worlde woorse then a woman, be shee neuer so good. The thirde, that the naughtinesse of a man is better than the goodnesse of a woman.


Annib.
These thre sentences serue rather to kepe in, than to cast out the spirite which is within me: and I se well you respect nothing, but the outwarde barke. But if the sharpnesse of your vnderstanding will pearce intoo the pith, you shall finde that those speches haue not bene vsed in reproche of women, but in reproofe of mens incontinencie, and frailtie. Who offende soo|ner in frequenting honest women, then noghtie men? For that haunting the companie of Userers, theues, ad|ulterers, slaunderers, and suche like, of euill Conuer|sation, they will not suffer themselues so soone to be temp|ted and taken by theyr naughtinesse, as in accompanying with women. For though they be neuer so chast and honest, yet men will be mooued with a lasciuious and disordinate

desire towardes them: whiche is verified by that which is saide, Thou canst neither be more learned then Dauid, nei|ther more strong then Sampson, neither more wise then Solomon, who notwithstanding haue falne by meanes of women. Beholde the very iuice and true meaning of the sentences by you alleaged, the whiche I wil say once more, are more mete to keepe in my spirite, then to cast him out. For if it bee so that vertue consist in thinges difficulte and vneasie, I thinke to doe a vertuous acte to coniure my sen|ses to bee quiet, and not to bee mooued any thing with the presence and company of women: amongest whom I haue gotten the habite to liue in this my tranquilitie of minde.


Guaz.
Your Philosophie perchaunce hath so mor|tified you, that you can promise your selfe the constancie of that Philosopher whom a woman tooke for an image. But I must tel you, that vertue is giuen to fewe,  it is knowne that not only the common sort of men, but euen Hermites them selues haue letten their Portis fall out of their handes at the sight of women.


Annib.
If I be not of the order of that Philosopher, neither am I of the disorder and lightnesse of those who are in loue with euery one they looke on, and haue so litle hold of them selues, that they will bee lost in the lookes of a wo|man, and are no more to be sene in them selues. Yea their folly is so great, that if a woman shewe but a merry coun|tenance, make some signe by chaunce, or vse any other ie|sture, they apply it all to themselues, as done in their fauour, and filled with a thousande vaine pleasures, and oftentimes make court to suche a one, whose minde is farre of both from them, and their purpose.


Guaz.
And this is also a fault of women, who are commonly saide to be like death, for that they followe those who flie them, and flie those which seke them.



Annib.
Honest women flie in dede those which follow them dishonestly. Yea, and the vnhonest flie too, though they suffer themselues soone to be ouertaken. But you shall neuer finde woman so shamelesse, but that she thinketh it a fault to followe others, and will be first sued to her selfe. So that y^e fault is not as you say in the woman, but in the man. But you seeme to be a verie rebell against women.


Guaz.
I am no rebell vnto them, for that I neuer pro|mised or swore faith or fealtie vnto them. But howe can a man loue them that are called women, of the woe and hurt they bring to men.


Anniball.
And why not of the woe and hurt they driue from men, which is confirmed by God him selfe, who saith, he made them for a helpe and comfort to man.


Guaz.
What, to helpe to consume a man as the Poet saide?

Lesbia doeth sucke the purse and bodie drie,
to buy loue so deere, is most extreeme follie.



Annib.
That is not the Conuersation that we are to speake of, and it semed verie straunge to me, that you be|ing a Courtier shoulde professe your selfe suche an enemy to women.


Guaz.
Pardon me I pray you, I mistooke you then, for so soone as you began to speake of the Conuersation of women: I thought you had ment of those with whom men trie their manhood withall in amorous incounters. For I thinke that those which make profession of the life, ought to learne, the meanes howe to trafike together in suche sort, that they may liue long time together in loue and liking. And touching women of honestie and reputation, you know well that it is my part not only to reuerence them, but to maintaine and defende their honour and good name, both with word and with sword. Yea, though dutie did not con|straine me to do it, yet affection should cary me to it, hauing ben alwayes most desirous of their fauour.


Annib.
We can not (sauing our honour) speake of the Conuersation which you meane: and in my fancy it is our

partes rather to ouerthrow it, then to build it vp, as a thing vnworthy of the ciuil Conuersation. And to the ende you re|maine no longer in suspence, I woulde haue you with me thinke this, that the nature of man is inclined to nothing more then to y^e loue of wome~. But that we may not be decei|ued, we must know, that there is one Venus in heauen, and another in earth: the latter is, the mother of wanton loue, the other, of honest affection. Wanton loue is nothing els but a passion, which blindeth the vnderstanding, peruerteth the minde, confoundeth the memory, wasteth the goods, wea|keneth the body, withereth youth, killeth age, which is the breder of vices, an inhabiter in idle and empty heads, which is a thing without reason, without order,  without any stay, a fault proper to fooles, and which is the abridger of mans li|bertie.


Guaz.
It appeareth you are well acquainted with our Boccace, seing you remember so well his sayings, wheretoo may be added, that of the Poet,
I see the thing I doe, the trueth which to my cost,
I know, no whit doth me deceiue, yet loue so rules the rost:
that who so foloweth it, no vertue folow shall,
for vnto lewdnesse  to vice, it doeth him daily call.


Annib.
For conclusion, so soone as this loue hath taken roote in the heart, in the same instant are lost goods, honestie, renoume, vertue, yea, body  oule. And therfore al those who are folowers of this fo~d brutish loue, are to be admitted only into the company of incontinent and naughtie women. For they are not worthie the presence and entertainment of the honest  vertuous. Next foloweth the heauenly loue, which being inamoured with the beauties of the minde, is the cause of much good, and of many commendable effectes. For it ma|keth men affable, discrete, curteous, painfull, pacient, va|liant, and as a braue writer hath alredie saide, It taketh from men all rude and clownishe behauiour, it maketh them familiar in companye, pleasaunte at the Ta|ble, amiable euerye waye. It is the chiefe bringer

in of mercy, and banisher of crueltie: it bredeth friendship, and driueth away hatred: it is it whiche maketh a man friendly, liberall, desirous to doe well, and loth to doe yll: it is a wise guide in our trauayles, in our desires, and in our woordes: to conclude, it is the most perfect ornament of mans life. And truely, if you marke the order of feastes, playes, and merie metinges of friendes, you will say, that all those assemblyes are colde and nothing delightfull, if there be no women at them. For as men in their pre|sence plucke vp their spirites, and indeuour by woordes, iestures, and all other wayes to giue them to vnderstande howe desirous they are of their fauour and good will, so you ought to thinke, the obiect being out of their eyes, they will become carelesse, mannerlesse, and lesse readie to com|mendable enterprises. To be shorte, women are they whiche kepe men waking and in continuall exercise: yea, I thinke there is no man so lazy and drouzy, but that he will open his eyes when hee heareth talke of women. And so soone as he spyeth comming a farre of, her whom he hath placed most nere to his heart, I warrant you he setteth his ruffes, he turneth his Cappe and feather the right way, he pulleth vp his cloake about his shoulders, he standeth a tiptoe, he sheweth a ioyfull and smyling countenaunce, and he semeth to be become a newe man, that he may bee more acceptable to the sight of his mistresse, in whose presence he chaungeth colour, and looketh pale, by rea|son that his heart abandoneth his bodie to followe her, be|ing drawne as it were by it owne image.


Guaz.
Women doe the verie same, who I warrant you woulde not be so fine, so trimmed and tricked vp, so a|miable euery way, but of a desire to please men.


Annib.
You se then that this loue is no lesse mutuall then honest.


Guaz.
Yea, but if this loue were so honest as you make it, you shoulde not se men shewe them selues more

affectionate to the fayre then to the foule, to the yong then to the olde. But you see fewe take pleasure either in ouer|worne antiquities, or vnsemely deformities. By reason wherof it is easie to be knowne, that they are in loue rather with the bodie then the minde: and that their loue is earth|ly, and fleshly, which you haue alreadie banished out of good companie.


Annib.
Women did the like for al the world towards men. For I knowe some of them whiche are very angrie in their mindes, when their chaunce is to be led in a daunce, either by a childe or an old man: whereas on the contrarie they are very glad when they haue gotten a young man by the hand.


Guaz.
In my opinion they haue great reason in it, for that as a wise man saieth, pleasures and fauours are not to bee done either to a childe or to an olde man. For the one forget|teth them, the other dyeth before he haue occasion to requite them.


Annib.
That is not the occasion which moueth them to doe so. And to auoide al confusion, we must consider that loue is a desire of beautie, and that beautie is of thre sortes, to wit: of the minde, of the body, and of the spech. The first is discerned by the vnderstanding, the second by the eyes, the third by the eares. And therfore it is saide that the thre gra|ces represent those thre partes. So long then as loue is gui|ded only by the eyes, the eares, and the minde, it is without question, honest,  wise louers ought to content themselues only with the fruition of those fruites, without thinking or seking any farther. And contrariwise, it cannot bee counted honest, or deserue the name of loue, but of lust  folly, when they are moued to it by any other of their senses. Nowe we are heere to consider, that naturally our mindes are most drawen thither, where beautie doth most abound:  therfore no meruaile if men for the most parte addresse themselues more willingly towards the faire  yong, then the foule and olde: for that in the faire and young commonly those thre sortes of beautie concur, of the minde, of the body, and of the

spech. Whereas in the foule and the olde the beauty of the body is wanting, which in the foule fayleth by nature, and in the old by length of tyme. The same reason may serue to shewe why women in banquets and dauncing make more account of young men then of children or olde men, for that in children there is no other beautie to bee sene but that of the body: for the two other are wanting, I meane of the speche whiche consisteth in pleasant deuise, and fine filed talke, and of the minde whiche is shewed in discrete behaui|our and vertuous dedes, which cannot be ripe and perfect in them. In old men is to be found only the beauty of the mind and of the speche, for that they haue not that of the body, which is worne away with time. But all the thre beauties mete together for the most part in yong men. And though this inclination bee common to men and women, yet you se some men fall in loue sooner with an olde woman then with a yong, and with a foule then with a faire: which happeneth likewise to some women, whiche beare feruent affection to some men who are altogether bereued of the beautie of the body, and in a manner deformed, but happily indued with vertue, pleasantly conceited, and valiantly giuen. A man can not terme this folly or lacke of iudgement. For it must be saide that a woman casting her fancy to a man of vnsemely personage, doth naturally make smal account of that outwarde beautie, and is induced to loue him in respect of the other beauties of spech, and of the mind: and that a man doeth the like towardes a woman. Neither ought we to thinke it straunge that some louers, the ol|der, they waxe the more feruently they loue one another: but we ought to iudge their loue the more perfect. For touching y^e woman y^e more she groweth in yeres, the more ripenesse the beauty of her mind groweth to,  the older the man waxeth, the better he is able to discerne the beauties of his mistresse, whereby his loue the more increaseth. But for that my chiefe purpose is not to discourse of loue, but of the conuer|sation with women, it shall suffice vs to knowe, that there

is no man in the worlde so blockishe, or suche a Cimon, who being in loue, calleth not his wittes about him, and waxeth not more wise: who by honest loue, and the curte|ous and pleasaunt company of women, feeleth not him|selfe inflamed with vertuous and heauenly thoughtes, and who besides other laudable studies, is not thereby stirred vp to Poetry. And thereof it commeth, that Apollo vaunting him selfe to haue ben the cause of the worke of a certaine Poet, fraught full of amorous deuises, Ve|nus withstoode the matter, saying, That that Poet had remained mute, if her sonne had not hit him with his gol|den shaft. Nowe touching the Conuersation with women, all men ought to knowe this, that they ought to doe them all the honour and reuerence possible, and that Romu|lus made a lawe whereby he ordeined, that in assemblies men shoulde alwayes set women aboue them. And though euerie man for the most part addresseth his seruice to some one aboue the rest, and maketh her the starre by whose a|spect he doeth direct all his doings, yet wee must not cease to shewe duetie and reuerence to all: and to shewe our selues both in dedes and woordes desirous of their good wil and fauour: taking hede howe we say or doe any thing at any time to their shame and reproch. For there is nothing that doeth more dishonour and defame a man then that: whereby he not only looseth his reputation, but also (being in the disfauour of women) is depriued of that contentati|on, whiche otherwise he shoulde receiue in their company. Wherefore it is best for a man alwayes to imploye his tongue to their prayse, neuer discommending them either openly or secretly, either vppon spight or in a rage, or vppon what occasion soeuer.


Guaz.
I thinke nothing in the worlde more difficult then to take from women an euil opinion, whiche they haue once conceiued against a man.



Annib.
You know they are easie to admit an accusati|on against a man, but hard to remit his offence. And as no|thing maketh them stomake vs more then to dispraise them, so there is nothing maketh them fancie vs more, then to co~|mende them. And for that cause, I haue knowen many wo|men whiche bore more fauour to the professours of learning and Poetrie, then to any other. Furthermore, he that fre|quenteth the companie of women, must not enter into strife, and contention with them, or seke too get the better in rea|soning with them. For by suche ouerthwart and obstinate dealing, there is nothing gotten at their handes, but yl wil. Therefore it is euer better rather to sooth them, then thwart them in their sayinges. But I will ende this matter, con|cluding that a man cannot doe amisse, so that he honour, serue, and obeye them, and omit nothing that may admit him into their fauour. On the other side, women ought to consider that men will not be so readie to doe them ho|nour, if in Conuersation they behaue not them selues mo|destly, according to their calling and kinde: and dispose not their dooinges in suche sorte, that men may like and thinke well of them. To bring whiche to passe, they are chiefly to take hede of one faulte whiche many of them hardly re|frame from, that is, from talking too much.


Guaz.
Doe not you knowe the Prouerbe, that thre women make a mereat?


Anniball.
I knowe also that it is commonly sayde, That where is least heart, is moste tongue. And therefore silence in a woman is greatly commended: for it setteth her foorth muche, and maketh her thought to be verie wise. Yea, she must not only haue regard to kep her tongue, but besides to acco~pany her words, her laughter, her lookes  behauiour, with such a graue  stately maiesty, as besemeth a matron, which I say, because there are in the worlde diuers women both honest, vertuous, and wittie, who cary the name of ma|trones, and yet in their outward behauiour, they shew them selues foolishe, riggishe, and retchles. There are other some

of them, who being good elderly women, vse the~selues like young wanton gyrles,  being women, behaue themselues as boldly as men: whereby they muche diminishe their credite and reputation. Moreouer, there are some, who coueting to be counted vnreasonable honest, frowne so yll fauouredly, and set suche a solemne and sowre countenance on the matter, that they make men thinke them rather proude then honest: and in stede of being well thought of, they make themselues ill liked of. Yea, and by that coy clowde, the bright shining of their beautie and vertue is o|uercast.


Guaz.
Therevpon the Poet saide.

That in a proper peece many good partes are hid
by curious nicenesse, which to none as yet good euer did.

And surely, they are muche deceiued in their rec|koning, which thinke to be thought more honest, by vsing daintie coynesse. For they consider not how bountie  cour|tesie are nothing repugnant to honestie, but rather alwaies accompanie it.


Annib.
I might here well speake of many women of our citie, who by the lowelinesse of their lookes, the comely|nesse of their persons, the swetenesse of their wordes, the quickenes of their capacitie, the modestie of their behauiour, and decency of maners, make men greatly delighted in their company. But for that the time would faile me to speak, namely and sufficiently of them all, and that the worthines of some of them is so great, that without suspition of enuy|ing their perfection, I cannot with silence ouerpasse it, I am minded to present one vnto you (without naming her) vpon whom all the graces and perfections that may be, are abun|dantly bestowed.


Guaz.
She hath great cause to stande vppon her pan|osles, and to thinke her halfe pennie better siluer then other womens.


Annib.
If she shoulde doe so, she shoulde loose much

of that honour and reputation she hath: for that which chiefly maketh men haue her in admiration is, that notwithstanding the surpassing excellencie, whiche is in her, she maketh no more account of her selfe then o|ther women doe: and semeth to shewe, that she doeth not knowe what good partes are in her. So that by this discrete humilitie, she is exalted to higher dignitie, and men haue her in the more honour. I say then that this La|dy in conuersation is singuler, and meruellous: for of all the noble partes in her, you shall se her make a most delightfull harmony. For first, to the grauenesse of her wordes, agreth the swetenesse of her voyce, and the honestie of her meaning: so that the mindes of the hea|rers intangled in those thre nets, fele themselues at one instant to bee both mooued with her amiablenesse, and brideled by her honesty. Next, her talke and discour|ses are so delightfull, that you wyll only then beginne to be sory, when shee endeth to speake: and wishe that shee woulde bee no more weary to speake, then you are to heare. Yea, shee frameth her iestures so discretely, that in spea|kyng, she semeth to holde her peace, and in holding her peace, to speake. Moreouer, when shee knoweth a mat|ter perfectly, and discourseth of it discretely, to the great commendation of her witte, yet she wyll seeme to speake of it verie doubtfully, to shewe her great modestie. She wyll also in talke cast oft times vpon a man such a swete smyle, that it were enough to bryng him into a fooles Pa|radise, but that her very countenance conteineth such con|tinencie in it, as is sufficient to cut of all fond hope. And yet shee is so farre from solemne lookes, and distributeth the treasure of her graces, so discretely and so indifferently, that no man departeth from her vncontented. Yet for all that, you must not thinke that shee is ouer prodigall of her curtesie. For I can assure you this, she winneth moe heartes euen with very slender rewardes, then other women doe with the greatest fauours they can possibly

shewe, And though shee giue good countenance to all, yet shee beholdeth them most graciously, and who bestowe their tyme in learning, or otherwise most commendably: in whose company shee taketh singular pleasure, whiche is a manifest signe of her vertuous disposition. But se the great wrong, whiche enuious fortune doeth to noble mindes, in not extolling her to the state and power of a Princes, that she might be able as well to preferre and bring the vertuous to promotion, as shee doeth nowe honour them, by bearing them singuler affection. I cannot sufficientlye set foorth vnto you the graces and perfections of this most perfect peece, but for conclusion I will say, that shee may well bee set for an example, whereto other women ought to conforme them selues, to bee acceptable and well thoughte of in the companie they shall come in.


Guaz.
If I bee not muche deceiued, I knowe who it is you speake of, and of whom you make this honourable report.


Annib.
I spake but of one, and yet yf all the women of this Citie should heare it, I am perswaded eue|rie one would thinke her selfe to be the woman I meant. But you may as well bee deceiued in gessing of whom I spake as I may in reading whom you meane. There|fore let vs speake no more of it, but let eache of vs be con|tent to kepe his thought secrete.


Guaz.
With a good will: But for so much as you haue set downe orders to the conuersation of women, and haue produced so rare, and so high an example, I am partly in doubte whether it bee good for men conti|nually to vse this conuersation, and therefore I thinke good you limite in what manner, and to what ende we ought to vse it.


Annib.
With all my hearte, for by that meanes you

giue me ocasion to set conuenient boundes to the conuer|sation of women. I say then that there are two sortes of leasure, the one euill, the other honest. I call that euill, which procedeth of a base minde, and which withdraweth a man from watching, from study, from trauell, and from all commendable actions: which is onely proper to those, who are good for nothing, who feare the Sunne and the raine, and which apply themselues to vaine deuises, and to the sa|crifice and seruice of Venus and Bacchus.


Guaz.
A brother of my taylour, whiche brought me home some apparell this morning, taketh it otherwise for talking with me of his affaires, he tolde me, that he hath foure brothers, wherof thre liued by their labour, as he did, but the other woulde not worke a stich, but goeth loytering vp and downe all day long, saying, That foure knaues may well mainteine and kepe one honest man: meaning that to worke, belongeth to slaues, but to be idle, to honest men. Nowe iudge you how many honest men there are by that rekoning, who are alwaies buied in taking their ease.


Annib.
Those same may well say, they haue receiued their hyre: for seing they inioy the plesure of being idle, they must not looke to receiue the rewarde of vertue. But thinke not yet, that though their bodies be at ease that their mindes are at quiet: for they are thereby the more occupied, yea, and eaten as it were with the rust of idlenesse: and not knowing howe to vse leasure as they ought to doe, they are more greued with doing nothing, then others with labou|ring harde. And this idlenesse is not only the cause of vaine and lasciuious thoughts, but also of wicked and dishonest dedes. Wherevpon Cato vsed to say, That those whiche did nothing, learned to doe yll. Besides that they are odi|ous to the worlde, yea, and to God also, who is highly dis|pleased, when a naughtie packe or an idle merchant craueth his aide and assistaunce. * For you know how he cur|sed the Figge tre which was without fruite. * Where|fore all those which delight to doe nothing, ought to knowe

that there is nothing procureth more infamie to a man, then idlenesse and effenatenesse. And if it be vnsemely for the ignorant to passe the time idle, muche more are they to be blamed who are learned. For it is a common saying, that he is in great faulte, which knoweth what is good and doeth it not: and that hee doeth muche yll, who knoweth no good. But for that I haue neither minde nor leasure to speake of these idle fellowes, I will nowe speake of ho|nest leasure, which belongeth to honest men: and I say that all affaires bring with them paine and trauell, by reason wherof it is requisite to take in time and place, for medicine, rest, and recreation, whiche are so necessary to our life, that without them we cannot long continue. And therefore it is both reasonable and necessary for a man, sometimes to repose himselfe, and withdrawe his minde from waightie and earnest cogitations, by the example of the inuincible Hercules, who for recreation sake vsed sometime too play with his litle children. Finally, our life is like to in|struments of musicke, whiche sometime wresting vp the stringes, and sometime by loosing them, become more melo|dious. And if we marke well the ende of the publique and solemne playes, whiche Princes in olde time caused to bee set foorth, we shall knowe that they did it not so muche to get themselues a good name amongest the people, as to re|create and refreshe men after their trauelles: that after such shewes they might returne more willingly, and cherefully to their worke.


Guaz.
I knowe by experience, that there is nothing doeth more weare me out, nor as they say make the bom|baste of my ublet so thinne as continuall affaires. And if I be molested with mine own priuate matters, you may well thinke that I am not only molested, but euen altogea|ther mortified with my maisters businesse, which to dispatch to my credite, and as duetie bindeth mee, maketh mee (as you may wel thinke) often cary a pensiue hearte within my brest: Being asured that I had by this time left my skinne

on the hedge, were it not that otherwhiles I force my self to vse some recreation and honest pastime.


Annib.
Though this leasure be honest, profitable, and necessary, yet there is a certaine measure to bee kept in it, whiche wee must not excede: For that nature hath not made vs for play and pleasure, but rather to spende our time in the study and execution of graue matters.


Guaz.
You meane then to et before mee this leasure, not as meate to fede me, but as a sallade to get mee a sto|make, or els as some confect to close vp my stomacke: and you allowe onely so muche leasure as is sufficient to recre|ate a man, and to renewe his strength after trauell: mea|ning, that we should play to liue, and liue to play.


Annib.
My meaning is euen so: for he that shoulde wallowe continually in pleasures and delightes, remaining alwaies idle without doing any thing, woulde soone become intemperate and lasciuious. Thereof it commeth, that in olde time were set downe the exercise of wrestling and Musicke, for the two strongest pillers, to stay vp our life by. For as the one maketh a man strong and fierce, so the other maketh him milde and gentle: But both togeather serue both the body and minde to muche purpose. Seing then that in the conuersation with women is chiefly founde this honest leasure, which serueth to comfort, yea, and to take from vs the greuous passions which oppresse our heartes, we must take hede that we be not so wrapped in it, that we neuer come out of it, least thereby we distemper the minde, and effeminate it in suche sorte, that it loose that cou|rage whiche is proper to man. And therefore we must vse that pleasure and recreation not for ordinary foode, but for some extraordinary preseruatiue, or some exquisite resto|ritie, remembring that olde saying, that we must taste ho|nie but with our fingers end: * yea, we must deale so warily in the matter, that it may be said that we haue ben in the very iawes of Scilla,  drunke of Cyrces cup, and yet haue escaped th drowning and transourming *.



Guaz.
Though this honest leasure (as you say) serue to take away the care of the minde, yet it is so that oft times in discourse (whiche is caused by this leasure) the minde is voide of trauell. For a man must whet his wits in suche sorte, that in stede of taking his ease, he sometime taketh more paine then when he is waightily affaired.


Annib.
I thinke there is no honest leasure, but hath some exercise of the minde or of the body ioyned vnto it. For the wise holdeth opinion, that to inioy leasure well, it is ne|cessary that we imploy it in learning somewhat. And ther|fore you se that though musicke hath been inuented for the pleasure and recreation of the minde, yet it is not learned by chaunce, but by science, about whiche a man must trauel his minde, like as at Chestes or other such games. Contrari|wise, it is our vse when we haue spent a great part of the day either in studie or about publique or priuate affaires, to walke either alone, or with company the space of an hour vpon pleasure. And though we exercise the body in going, and the minde in deuising, yet all that time is attributed to leasure and recreation: for that it is chiefly bestowed to the ende to withdrawe the minde from waightie affaires, and carefull thoughts.


Guaz.
You make me heere remember our peasants of the countrie, who hauing laboured sore al the weeke, spende the sunday in daunsing out of al crie: in so much that sauing your reuerence, they stinke of swet, and take more payne that day only, then they doe in all the worke dayes besides. And yet according to your opinion it must bee called leasure or passetyme.


Annib.
It can not be termed otherwise: for albeit they exercise the body lesse in working then in daunsing, yet they doe the one with paine and griefe, and the other with so great pleasure, that it maketh them the next day after goe to their worke a great deale more lustily. And if you meane nothing else, I confesse that I my selfe am in that res|pect of the nature of those Countrie fellowes, for being

weried with the continuall exercise, I vse all the day, sometime on foote, sometime on horsebacke, to see my pa|tients, in the euening, in way of pastime and recreation, I often walke with your brother, or others, almost halfe a mile out of the towne: and in this paine I finde great ease and refreshing to my minde that is weeried with the trauel of the day. Whereby you vnderstande that all the time whiche is chiefly spent for pleasure, ought too goe vnder the name of leasure, though there bee in it some exercise ei|ther of minde or body. It is very true, that this leasure looseth it name, when it is turned into continuall exercise without doing ought els, so that a man cannot properly tearme leasure or pastime, the exercise of a Musitian, who all the day long doeth nothing but teache some or other to sing, or to play on some instrumentes. In whiche respect belike Phillip kyng of Macedon rebuked his sonne Alexan|der, for that hee was so skilfull in Musicke, not that he mis|liked musike, but because his sonne was so exquisite in it, that hee doubted it was his chiefe profession, neglecting o|ther thinges more necessary to his estate: whiche was not vnlike to the doing of the Emperour Domitian, who put from being of his counsayle a Noble man, because hee daunced too artificially. Wherefore wee may gather here|by, that wee ought not in passing the time to loose the time: but to limite this leasure in suche sort, that we take no more of it then is necessary for the recreation of our mindes.


Guaz.
I am of opinion, that amongest many past|times and pleasures, whereby mens mindes are recreated, there is none more to bee accounted of, then that which is taken in feastes and banquets: I meane not the sumptuous and solemne ones, but the friendly and familiar, which are set foorth by a Poet, for the things most apperteining to the felicitie of mans life.


Annib.
As solemne feastes are full of noyse and con|fusion, so the other are full of quiet and friendship. And

as the first by the diuersitie and delicacie of fare, prouoke me~ to the pleasure and filling of the body, so the other with so|brietie,  the good companie of only friends together, works the solace and recreation of the mind.


Guaz.
I can not but often commend that most ciuil custome of Fraunce, where the parents, friends, and neigh|bors agre together, to bring euery one their ordinary proui|sion, assoone into the house of one, assoone of another, where without great cost, and yet with great varietie of meate,  diuersly dressed, leauing all their pensiue thoughts without the doore, they suppe merily, louingly, and friendly together.


Annib.
That good custome is no doubt greatly to be commended: for if sometimes in trauayling by the way, it greatly refresheth vs, when at our inne we meete with good companie (though straungers vnto vs) with whom wee may talke  be mery at the table, you may soone gesse howe much more good it doth vs, when wee are in the companie of our kinsfolkes and friends.


Guazzo.
I thinke that in this kinde of conuersation also, there are some orders and lawes to be prescribed, there|fore I looke you should make mention therof.


Annib.
Many excellent writers haue set downe many orders to be obserued in feasts, but the chiefe are these, that the feast alwayes ought to begin at the Graces, and ende at the Muses: that is, that the number of the guests be not vnder thre, nor aboue nyne: that they be neither too talkatiue, nor too dumbe: that no man take al the talke to himself, a thing very vnsemely, for al ought to bee partakers aswell of the talke, as they are of the wine. That the discourse be pleasant, and of suche matters as men haue no leasure to talke of a|broade while they are about their businesse: ioyning (if it may be) pleasure with profite. That the talke, specially a|mongst women, be not doubtful, hard  intricate: wherby e|uen amongst men, the hearers are made melancholike by beating their braines to vnderstand it. And therevpon it is saide, that a certaine Oratour being requested at a table to speake of eloque~ce, answered, Those things which are fit for







to satisfie a new friend, wherein I greatlye commende your wit, and giue you most harty thankes for it, desiring you to inriche my poore vnderstanding, with the treasure of your gentle and learned discourses: that you may haue iust cause to continue your good opinion of me,  I may be made wor|thy of the prayse you giue me, in esteeming me more then all the magnificence of Genes.


Annib.
If it be so that your vertue receiue increase by my discourses, it is so also that my discourses are much bet|tered by your witty demaundes: but to returne to our mat|ter, we haue to intreate this daye (according to our yester|dayes determination) of the domesticall conuersation, that is to say, within the house, which we will likewise reduce to those two speciall poyntes, of speeche, and of behauiour: for I must tell you, that I meane not in this dayes discourse to set downe how a man should well gouerne a house, nor how a mayster of a house ought to prouide for thinges, appertay|ning to foode, to apparell, to his profites, to his expenses, to buildinges, to tilling of his ground, and to the sauing of his goods: but I meane to speake of the perticuler points which they of one houshold ought to obserue in conuersatio~ one w^t an other. And to come to the matter, I say that for the most part the domesticall conuersatio~ happeneth eyther betweene the Husband and the Wife, the Father and the Sonne, the Brother and the Brother, or the Mayster and the Seruant: and of these foure pointes shall our discourse consist.


Guaz.
I thinke this deuision ought to haue bene more large: for seing in families there are the Uncle and the Ne|phew, the Father in law and the Sonne in law, the step Mo|ther, and the steppe Daughter, the Coosins and Allies, me thinkes that diuision is not great ynough.


Annib.
As vnder the name of Father and Sonne, I haue comprehended Mother and Daughter, vnder the name of Brothers, Sisters, and of Maysters and man, Mistreis and mayde, so I include the Uncle, the Father in Law, and the Tutour, in the name of Father: and the Sonne in law, the Daughter in law, and the Pupill, in the name of Sonnes:

and the Coosins  Allies, in the name of Brothers: so that in my opinion, the deuision before made, is not defectuous, neyther requireth any addition of thinges superfluous. And for so much as the cheefe conuersation commeth by meane of mariage, for that Cities cannot be without families, nor families without Husband and Wife, let vs enter into the fielde, and begin with the conuersation of the maried, seeing the cheefest honour is due vnto it, not onely for that it is first in order, but also for that there is no conuersation more a|greeable to nature, then that of the male and female.


Guaz.
Though our cheefe purpose be to speake of the con|uersation betweene the husband and the wife, yet I think it were not amisse that you should first giue some good instruc|tions to him that meaneth to marry.


Annib.
Your aduise liketh me well, and it may be that that speeche shall haue force to stir vp in our hartes a desire to marry.


Guaz.
I haue heard say that there commeth some time vp|on vs by chaunce a desyre or appetite, which you Phisitions call disordinate, to which you forbid meate: if then that ap|petite of marying a wife shall chaunce to come vppon me, for my part I meane to satisfie it by no other meane then by ab|stinence: calling to my remembraunce the great commen|dation a Philosopher gaue to those that had a great desyre to sayle, and yet would neuer hazard themselues on the sea: to gouerne common wealthes, and yet woulde neuer meddle with it: to marry a wife,  yet would neuer marry any. * Or I thinke it good to doe in that point as one did, who being earnestly solicited by his mother to take a wife, aunswered her, that it was not yet time: and being a few months after importuned by her in the same matter, he aunswered that now the time was past. *


Annib.
There are some men so daintie and delicate, that they know not what they will themselues, but mislike of e|uery state of life: but you know that a wise and stayde man frameth himselfe cherefully many kinde of life, and special|ly forgetteth not this sente~ce, That it is an execrable thing

wilfully to depriue ones self of immortalitie, which he doth who seeketh not to haue wife and children: mary I say not for all that, that it behoueth euery man to haue a wife by his syde, but rather I forbid it to manye persons: for I say vnto you, that manye occasions offer themselues, where|by the diuell, enimy to our quiet, putteth himselfe betweene the husband and the wife, and not only maketh the maryage to haue vnhappy successe, but besides, therby bringeth many houses and families to ruine and decay.


Guaz.
I would gladly heare what those occasions are.


Annib.
He that would make narrow search for them, might find inow of them: but I remember three of the cheifest, which are not to be concealed in this discourse. The first is, inequality betweene the maried couple, eyther in yeeres, or in calling: whereof arise so many quarrels  inconuenie~ces, y^t I thinke it most necessary that the parties be equall.


Guaz.
Touching the difference in yeeres, me thinks it is an vnseemely thing, to see a yong woman matched with a man that carryeth the countenaunce rather to be her father than her husband, and I am perswaded, that yong dainty damsels go as willinglye to such husbandes, as they woulde doe to their graues. For they are sure to become wydowes in their husbandes lyfe tyme: besydes that, they which haue been so matcht know, how troublesome an olde husbande is to a yong wife: yea and which is worst of al, the poore soules are in this hard plight, that what honesty so euer be in them, or what modesty so euer be in their behauiour, yet men will not stick to mutter that they are lewde and light, only by re|son of their husbandes white bearde. And I know not which I may count greater, of the ielousie which is entred into the husband, or of the suspicion which is giuen by the wife.


Annib.
Consider I pray you, on the other side, the good|lye name whiche wrinkled and toothlesse women gette in taking to husbandes young and beardlesse boyes, and tel me whether the rage of those women be not greater then the hard fortune of the other: but to make short, there can be no agreemente betweene suche contrarieties. And as Venus

and Saturne are at continual warre the one with the other, so the old coupled with the yong, neuer agree together. The like happeneth in mariages which are not equall in calling and condition: for so long as the one shall be nobly minded, and the other basely giuen, there can be no consent of minds, nor agreement in good will, but continuall stryfe and de|bate. Now to the former occasion of vnhappinesse in mari|age, I wil ad the second, which is, whe~ the mariage is made against the will and liking of the parties: whereof I haue seene great inconuenience to grow, to the shame, reproche,  to late repentaunce of the makers of such mariages: but this disliking is for the most part on the womans syde, withoute whose knowledge the mariages are talked of, and conclu|ded, and the dowry tolde and payde: yea they are often con|ueyed to their husbands into stra~ge countreys amo~g barba|rous people, before they haue any inkeling of the matter, by meanes whereof the miserable wretches, fearing the com|mandement and rigour of their parents, are many times in|forced to doe agaynst their mynde, and to accepte with their mouth that which they refuse with their hart.


Guaz.
In Fraunce there happen no such disorders, where the maydes as well as the men haue free liberty to say yea, or nay, as their fancy serueth them.


Annib.
But let vs come to the third occasyon, which per|chaunce is that which importeth more, and which alwayes bringeth forth euill effectes, which is, when a man taketh a wife without dowry.


Guaz.
You haue reason: for when these husba y^t mar|ry for loue only, consider with themselues how their wiues haue brought nothing vnto them, their loue beginneth to waxe colde, and repenting their folly, they begin to vse them not like wiues, but like kitchinstuffes: whereas those that marry riche wiues, are sure stil to haue somewhat to bee in loue withall: you see how now adayes fayre women with|out riches fynde more Louers then Husbandes, and there are few that take wiues for Gods sake, or as the saying is, For their fayre lookes: for euery man nowe hath his eyes

open, neyther care they for fleshe that hath neither taste nor sauour: yea they haue alway this saying in their mouth.

Bring somewhat with thee,
If that thou meane to liue with mee.



Annib.
I see Syr you take the matter wrong, and that you are farre wide of my meaning.


Guaz.
How I pray you?


Annib.
For that if a man marrying a poore wyfe, make a drudge of her, a Woman likewise marrying a poore Hus|bande, maketh a slaue of him, so that, that commeth all to one reconing.


Guaz.
Your meaning is then that a man shoulde take a Wife neither richer nor poorer then himselfe, but equall in both and that he should not take for dowrye that whiche is more or lesse.


Annib.
Yet you vnderstande me not, for that you take for dowry tolde money.


Guaz.
Why, you know that by dowry is ment the money and the riches that a woman is possessed withal,  so y^e great lawmaker Licurgus vnderstoode it, when he made a speciall law, that maydes should bring no dowries to their husba~ds, and if you take it not so, me thinkes (vnder your correction) you take it too straungely, and too obstinately.


Annib.
Licurgus gaue that Law to a people composed of the learned, and of the ignoraunt, by reason whereof it stood him vpon to speake that euery man might vnderstande him: but I talke with you, who by the deepenesse of your vnder|standing, canne reache to the knowledge of the dowry which passeth all other dowries, wherewith you are so plentifullye endowed, that if you were a Woman, you would greatly in|riche your husband.


Guaz.
I feele my self now pleasantly ridden vpon by you: and I see well, that you speake of the dowry of the minde.


Annib.
The same Licurgus being askte why he woulde haue men take wiues without dowries: aunswered wisely, that he did it to the intente that none shoulde bee reiected in respecte of their pouertye, nor none chosen in respecte of

their riches: but for that we liue in a time, farre differente from those times, I thinke it not amisse to take a meane dowrye to helpe beare the charges incident to mariage, and to maintayne himselfe in that viewe whiche belongeth to his calling. But I would not haue a man doe as two olde men of this citie did, who treating a mariage betweene the Sonne of the one, and the Daughter of the other, haue stayde this fyue yeares aboute a matter of a hundreth Crownes before they will conclude it, giuing the worlde playnlye to vnderstande, that they sette more by the money, then by the affinitie. And therefore it were better to keepe a meane, and to marry one neyther too riche nor too poore, for the ouer poore, bringeth into her husbandes house neces|sitie, and the ouer rich seruilitie. * And as he is termed most vnfortunate, who weddeth a poore wife, so it is a common aying, That where entereth in the riche dowrye, there go|eth out the free libertye. * But returning from whence I began: wee must take heede, that in taking a Wife, fonde Fancye bee not our guide, and that we bee not caried away, eyther with riches, or bewty, without vertue. Women likewise ought to haue the same consideration, who are of|ten surprised with an outward appearance, desiring for hus|bandes, those who like Cipres trees are high and fayre, but beare no fruite.


Guaz.
Seing you allow of dowry to support the charge of mariage, I thinke you will not disalow of the bewty of the wife, for the contentment of the husband.


Annib.
Albeit she be sufficiently fayre, which is furni|shed with the bewty of the mynde: yet I woulde bee loth to haue for a companyon, for so long a time, one that is defor|med, for that our nature abhorreth things foule  mo~strous: besides y^t, an ill fauoured face is oft times take~ for a token of il fauoured co~ditions,  it sildome falleth out, y^t a good mind is lodged in a mishapen body. And if there be any, which ha|uing viewed their own deformity in a glas, haue by vertue  good qualities supplied the default of nature, though y^e wise wil account the~ for bewtiful  perfectly shaped, yet y^e vulgar

sort will count them but counterfaite. I reme~ber a prety iest of a Gentleman of great countenaunce, marye of a very ill countenaunce, and euill fauoured face, who being inuited to supper by a Gentleman of his acquaintaunce, went thyther alone somewhat before supper time, but the mistrisse of the house thinking he had been a seruaunte sente before by his Mayster, hauing set her own seruauntes about other busy|nesse, prayed my Gentleman to cleane some woode: whiche he set himselfe about very diligentlye. Now the Gentle|man that had inuited him, comming in the meane while, as|ked him what he did. To whom he aunswered with a merry countenaunce, that hee bore the payne of his deformitie: Whereby you see how the euil fauourednesse of persons di|minisheth their dignitie. And as I woulde not willinglye haue an ill fauoured wife, so neyther would I haue one that were sickly, or not likely to bring forth perfect and goodlye children, the which the more fayre  well proportioned they are, the more amible they are, the more fitte for any enter|prise, and the more capable of dignities and promotions: and therevpon the Poet Mantuan promiseth by the mouth of Iuno, a fayre Nimphe in marriage to the King of the Wyndes, whereby he maye become the Father of a goodly offspring.


Guaz.
I thinke verely those husbandes are most vnfortu|nate which are troubled with foule ill fauoured wyues, if it were but in their dreames only: And I know not which is worse, to haue a pore wife, or a foule one.


Annib.
You shall then knowe it, when you shall knowe which is worst, to fare ill, or to seepe ill.


Guaz.
It is very true that the euill of a poore wife is in a manner curelesse, whereas the inconuenience of a foule wife may be some way redressed.


Annib.
And which way?


Guaz.
Mary by prouiding for himselfe a prety wenche in his house, and to doe as one sayde, I know not who:
If that thy wife be foule, and that thy maide be faire,
To haue thy wife let thee suffise, thy maiden neuer spare.



Annib.
That saying commeth from a wanton Authour, and is rather to be reprooued then followed: as there was a Gentleman of this Countrey, who would in no wyse follow it, whose happe was to haue a wife of great stature, with a prety long beard on her chinne, and so monstrous a creature euery way, that it was doubtfull whether she were a woma~ or a tyger: and to make it short, she was such a one, that hee which should deale with her, should rather do penaunce then co~mit offence: well, she passing along the strete, in the co~pa|nie of some fine dames, certain Gentlemen straungers stai|ed to view her, laughing and wondering at her: and as her husbande by chaunce passed by, one of them asked him what she was: who poore man shrinking in his neck, sayd he knew her not.


Guaz.
He might well say he had more wife then hee nee|ded.


Annib.
Yet he had not more then he loued, for he vsed her well, and would follow none of that corrupt counsaile you a|leaged but now.


Guaz.
You tell me of the great goodnesse of a husbande, and of the great happinesse of a wyfe, but I thinke if he doe not lothe her, yet at leaste hee doeth by her as men doe by thinges they make deare account of, which is, to keepe them very carefully, and neuer to vse them but in great necessity: not louing (as the prouerbe is) to be dronken with their own wine.


Annib.
Well, how deare so euer she is vnto him, he maye be sure she shall not be taken from him: but let vs fall from the foule to the fayre.


Guaz.
And a man cannot securely keepe them, for euerye one will be catching at them. I remember that a Gentle|man sente a Paynter to a verye fayre womans house, to drawe her Picture, but her Husbande comming in the meane while, hindred his worke, and draue him foorth of doores, saying that perhaps the Gentleman which sent him, after he had the Copye, would seeke to haue the originall al|so, but in comparison betweene the fayre and the foule, I

say for my part that it is lesse greefe to be hanged on a fayre payre of gallowes.


Annib.
It is yet an ordinary saying, That he y^t hath a white Horse, and a fayre woman, is neuer without trouble: wher|to maye be added this saying: Haste thou taken one fayre? to thine owne care. And you haue often heard reported of di|uers women, whose singuler bewty hath brought their hus|bandes to distruction: besides, wee muste remember how for the most parte pride and bewtye goe together: and that the wyfe of Herode though she were sober and chaste, yet by knowing the excellency of her owne bewty, she became mar|ueylous proude and arrogant.


Guaz.
The Poet shewed that, saying:
Her bewtie is so euenly matcht with pride,
That pleasing others cleane she set aside.


Annib.
Ad hereto that bewty breedeth temptation, temp|tation dishonour: for it is a matter almost impossible,  siel|dome seene, that those two great enimies, bewty, and honesty agree togither. And hardly may a ma~ assure himself of those things, which almost euery man sigheth for, and sueth for: some assaulting them with their proper personages, some w^t their good wit, some with eloquence in wordes, some with magnificence in deedes. And though it fall out often that bewty and honesty are ioyned togither, yet it falleth out sieldome, but that exquisite bewty is had in suspition: whereby the renowne of the Husband and Wife is but sinis|terly iudged of. I leaue here to speake of the Warres and destructions of diuers people and countreyes, happening on|ly by the peerelesse bewtie of some women: and it shall suf|fise to co~clude, that there is nothing in the world which cau|seth greater discorde and trouble, then a woman when she is desired of diuers men.


Guaz.
If then a man can take neither faire nor foule, with out inconuenience, it is best to meddle with none at all.


Annib.
Yes you must take one that is neyther fayre nor foule. It is long since that I learned that the perfection of the body consisteth in the meane, so that it bee neither too

strong nor too bewtifull, neither to weake, nor to deformed: for the one maketh folke audacious  proude, the other low  base minded. And therefore meane bewty is highly commen|ded, and becommeth a woman best: Whereas the extremity of fairenesse or foulenesse is much misliked, for that the one tormenteth, the other lotheth: breefely, the bewty, gestures, and countenances of a woman, ought to be such, y^t most men may like of them: for therby their husbandes will be stirred vp to loue them, and bridled from louing others besides the~: but if they be not amiable in other mens eyes, surelye their husbands wil neuer make great account of them: for a man careth not to possesse y^t thing, which no ma~ coueteth to haue.


Guaz.
But what thinke you of those which floorish vp the~ selues by art, saying they doe it to please their husbandes?


Annib.
But doe you thinke that it is so?


Guaz.
I thinke the gorgious apparell they put on when they go abrode, is rather to please those which are abrode, then the husband that is at home.


Annib.
We ought to thinke also, that those which vse arti|ficial means, displease God much, in altring his image, and please men neuer a whit, in going about to deceiue them. I know no man of iudgeme~t, but setteth more, by ods, by a na|turall bewty that sheweth but meanly, then by a painted ar|tificial bewty that shineth most gallantly: And I would wish those dawbed, pargetted,  vermilion died faces, to consider what scoffes and mocks, men when they are by themselues, giue to those bolstred bewties, which are euer accompanied with two false perswasions: the one, that they thinke them|selues made bewtiful by the force of those artificiall colours: not knowing, as a Poet sayth,
That painting could not Hecube Helene make:
The other, y^t they think those which loke on the~, to take that painting for a natural colour: For I knew one once inueigh earnestly against counterfaite women, not perceiuing poore foole her owne purple died face, wheras some of the coolours stacke vppon her gorget: but such women woulde be tryed in such sort as a great many were once by an honest Matrone:

who at a feast making one at a game wherein euerye one by turnes commaundeth ouer all the rest, being come to her turne, she caused a basen with water to be brought, where|with she forthwith washed her hands  face, commaunding al the rest to do as much, wherby a great many of them with greefe  shame made y^e painting run down along their chee|kes. I know also a yong woman, whose face two monthes since was like a coliers, and now she ietteth vp and downe so bewhited, or rather so bepainted, that she seemeth quight an|other woman: yet when she wrieth her head a little, there appeareth such blacknesse in her neck and throate, so differe~t from her face, that you would verely thinke it were a Fle|minges head set vpon a Moores necke.


Guaz.
Belike y^t pore woman knoweth not that the payn|tinges of the face described in the secretes of Alexis, will serue also for the neck and throate.


Annib.
If such vanities be to be borne withal in women, yet the grosse folly of some husbands is by no meanes to bee pardoned, for some seing y^e paintings of their wiues, alow of it, perswading themselues that it is done to please them, and they on y^e other side to please their wiues, wil set y^e cap awry after the cuttingest manner: some husbands also find much fault with those women that loue not to curle vp their heare roistingly, but vse to kembe it down smoothely, swearing by no beggers, that if their wife should vse it, they would wind her neck behind her, like a chicken. I knowe not which of these two sortes are the veriest fooles, the one for liking that which is euill, the other for disliking that which is good.


Guaz.
In truth I cannot thinke well of such women, and I make account that as their colours are faygned, so also is their hart and affection, so that there is not to be looked for at their handes any pure or faythfull good will. It is to be thought that loue being naked, loueth none of this counter|fayte disguising, wherevpon our Gentle Tuscane, to nippe those women which are curious in such follies, and to giue a singuler commendation to madame Laure, termeth her bew|ty naturall.



Annib.
We will maintayne then, that a woman taking a|way  changing y^e coolour and complexion which God hath giuen her, taketh vnto her that which belongeth to a harlot. And as y^t which is naturall is the worke of God, so y^t which is counterfaite, is the doing of the diuel: yet I must say, that this art is not so generally to be condemned, but that it is in some cases to be tollerated: for if it be permitted to a man to seeke remedy to take away some wart, moale, spot, or suche like disgrace co~ming by chaunce: by much more reaso~ ought it to be allowed to a woma~, to correct by art any imperfectio~, either natural or casuall, appearing in her face. Wherfore we wil allow it lawful for a woma~ to redresse any thing y^t is amis about her by art, so y^t she be necessarily driuen thereto, either by some indisposition of her body, or for the conserua|tion of her femenine state: prouided it be done so slightly,  so discretely, that the artificial dealing be not seene, or beeing seene, that it be not misliked. And for so muche as wee are a|greed that a wife is to be chosen neither to faire nor to foule, it is best we passe farther, and from henceforth indowe a Wife with that dowrye whiche maye make the mariage firme and sure. Fyrste, wee are to reprooue the abuse of men, who in choosing a Wife, vse no other order then they doe in buying a Horse, for the buyer will bee sure to prye into euerye parte, whether hee bee sounde of winde, and limme, whether he be without cracke or flawe, whether he be yong, and of good stature, whether he be well paced, and haue those outwarde markes which betoken a good Horse. I denye not, but by the lookes of a Woman, a man maye ga|ther somewhat of her disposition, but seing God hath com|maunded vs not to iudge by the face, we must vse a more cer|tayne and commodious way.


Guaz.
I haue alwayes liked of those mariages which are treated of freely, without hiding any thing, which after co~|ming to light, bringeth greefe  repentaunce to one of y^e par|ties: but neither men nor women vse that order, indeuouring so much as they may, to couer their faultes, as wel of y^e body as the minde: by the example of the painter, who being to

draw a one eyed Gentlema~, would not draw his whole fate, but represented him in suche sorte that the defectuous parte was not perceiued.


Annib.
The Philosopher Crates did not so, who beeing requested in mariage by a vertuous and honest woma~, went before her, and thinking to himselfe that she was ignorante that he was crookte backt, lame, and poore, he put me of his cloake, and layde it downe by his staffe and his wallet, and after protested vnto her, that his wealth and his bewty was euen such as she saw, and that she should consider well of it, that she might not after haue cause to repent her bargayne: but she for all this, accepted the party, saying that she could not possibly haue a husbande more riche or bewtifull then him.


Guaz.
Now I pray you go to that poynt which you promi|sed, whereby husbandes may deale surely in the choyse of wyues.


Annib.
I will shew it you by the authoritie of Olympias
the mother of Alexander, whose saying, worthy to be writ|ten in letters of Golde, was: that women are to be married with the eares, before they are with the eyes, for the custom of our countrey, not permitting men to haue free accesse to the houses where the maydes to be married are, not to inter|tayne them with familier deuice, as the fashion in Fraunce and other places is, we ought at least to deale in such sort, that out of the mouth of diuers, constant report may come to our eares of the parentage, and of the life and behauyour of them: but the greedinesse of the worlde is so great at this day, that men seeke diligently for Asses, Oxen, and Horse, of a good race, but a man careth not though his wife bee ill brought vp, and worse borne, so that she be rich ynough: but he that is wise will aboue all thinges haue a speciall regard of the conditions and qualities of his wife, and will note what the life and conuersation of her parentes is, and hath bene, remembring the saying, that the Eagle breedeth not the Pigeon, but that Cat will after kynde: And verily it is a very rare matter to see children treade out of the path of

their parentes and predecessoures, yea I am sure you canne call to your remembraunce families, where are to be seene by succession in the Nephewes and children, the rootes of couetousnesse, beastlinesse, foolishnesse, dronkennesse, or such other faultes wherewith their parentes before them were spotted, whereby the Prouerbe is verified, that an ill byrde, layeth an ill egge, as on the other side it is sieldome seene that a good tree bringeth forth ill fruites.


Guaz.
I cannot hold with your opinyon in this, for dayly experience sheweth that that rule fayleth often (that I may not say is false alway) if you search the auncient histories, you will in a manner say that nature doth not her parte, for you shall finde that many vertuous men haue been begotten by vyle and foolishe fathers: and contrariwise, that many good and wise fathers haue gotten foolish and naughty chil|dren. And if we may beleeue thinges present, doe wee not see and know many very honest wome~, who haue very disho|nest harlots to their daughters? wherefore we maye assure our selues that in mariage, fortune beareth more sway then wisedome: and that it suffiseth without beeing so curious, to crosse ones self, and so to be lead blindfolde to this bar|gayne.


Annib.
The doubt which you haue put, no doubt is great, and worthy your wit, but though it cannot bee denyed, but that good Parentes may sometyme haue children of naugh|ty nature, so that (as you say) my rule holdeth not, yet some say further, y^t it alway falleth out, that a good Father get|teth a naughty child, whiche agreeth with the saying, That the children of Princes and rulers are sieldome of such per|fection as others, and yet they will not haue Nature in the faulte, but affirme contrarily, that nature doth not her duty, when a wise Father getteth a sunne like to himselfe: foun|ding their opinion vpon certayne subtile and Philosophical reasons, which at this time I meane to omit. Now the case being so, it were good for a man that would marry, to be sure that his wife come of ill parentes, and it were best for wyse men to take heed how they marry, for feare of getting fooles

to their children: but I take not the matter to be so,  there|fore I answere you and those other, That nature alway ten|deth to the best: so that of good parentes, ought naturally to come good children: and if it fall out sometyme otherwise, the fault is not to be imputed to nature. For if one looke ad|uisedly into the matter, he shall see, that for the most part it happeneth not by the byrth, but by the bringing vp: That is the cause that many grosse heads, by continual study become ready witted: and other who euer in their cradell are found to haue a quick wit, in processe of tyme, eyther through idle|nesse, or gluttony, or some such misgouernment, become slow and dull headed. Nowe from that consideration, I woulde haue you come to this, that the Father who, through much trauayle and trouble, both of mynde and body, hath gotten wealth and honour, though he getteth children of great wit, yet he is so ouergone in fatherlye affection towardes them, that knowing he hath prouided for them sufficient to liue by at their ease, he cannot abide to see them trauaile and labour as he hath done: so that, vanquished with a certain tender af|fection, he suffereth them to be brought vp delicatelye, and wantonly, and is the cause, that by this ydlenesse, their na|turall force decayeth, and by custome and habite, is changed into another nature. Consider besides, how the children per|ceiuing themselues thus coaxed, and pampered by their pa|rents, keepe themselues, so much as they maye, oute of the dust and the sunne: neither care to apply their mynde to any commendable thing, or to seeke to get more then that liuing which their parentes haue lefte them: not vnlike the crow, which liueth only by the foode whiche other Beastes leaue. And sure there is no doubt of it, but that if they were mean|ly left by their parentes, they would grow to be wise, and sufficient men. And thereof you see, that for the moste part, poore mens children become rich by their own study and in|dustry, and riche waxe poore by their negligence  idlenesse: which is signified vnto vs, by that pleasaunt wheele whiche turneth vp this saying: Riches breede pride, pride pouerty, pouerty humilitie, humilitie riches,  riches agayne pride:

We will maintaine then for most true, touching generation, that as a man of men, and of beastes a beast, so of the good for the most part, is ingendered the good: but the good Father must be admonished that he trust not so much in the goodnes of his nature, that hee thinke that onelye sufficiente to keepe his children good: but beholding them with an eye ra|ther aduised, then pitifull and fatherly, he must seeke to bet|ter their good nature, in stirring them vp to vertuous deeds, assuring themselues that to ariue to the perfectio~ of vertue, it is not ynough to be wel borne, but also to be wel brought vp: whereof we will speake by and by in more conuenient place. In the meane while in the choyse of a wife we shal not doe amisse to be wel infourmed of the honesty of the mother, in hope that the daughter will follow her honest nature, and conditions, and that we shall haue much lesse paine to keepe her in her goodnesse, the~ if by the peruerse nature of the mo|ther she were naturally inclined to ill: but it is not ynough to know the qualities of the mother, but we must likewise be priuy to the conditions of the Father, for that the children participate with the nature of both two: and it often falleth out, that they draw some imperfection from the one of them, which the other is cleare voyde of. And though it be expedi|ent for euery man to haue a wife that is well borne, yet I would haue Gentlemen especially take heede, y^t they matche only with those that come of Gentle blood: for the cauilling of Sophists against gentrie, is vayn, who hauing no regarde to thinges common, and knowne to euery man, to wit, that to haue a good race, men buy horse and dogges whiche come of a good kinde, of fruites also they make choise of the beste sortes, will not likewise consider that to a Gentleman the good byrth of his wife is auayleable, for the issue they shall haue betweene them, nor weigh how much it importeth to the children, whether their originall be barbarous or other|wise, wherein like ignorant fellowes, they shew themselues not to know, that in generation there are certaine secret in|stincts of vertue and excellency, communicated by the Pa|rents to the children.



Guaz.
I now consider that if it be true that education be another nature, yt is requisite not only to knowe whether ones wife be borne of good parents, but also whether shee haue been orderly and well brought vppe: whiche alwayes commeth not to passe, for that there are some who hauing but one daughter, ar so blinded with the extreame loue they beare her, that they will not haue her hindred of her will in any thing, but suffer her to liue in all wanton pleasure  de|licasy, which afterwards is y^e cause of many inco~ueniences.


Annib.
You are not a whit deceiued: yet for all that the husbande must not be discouraged for the too muche tender|nesse of the parentes ouer her: for she being yet but young, with the helpe of her good nature, he may easily, like a ten|der twig, make her straight if she begin to growe crooked: and with graue admonitions refourme her wanton mynde. Therby we may gather, that it is better to marry a young gyrle, then a mayde of ripe yeres, who is hardly brought to leaue her old il trickes, if she haue taken any.


Guaz.
Yet there are some of a contrary opinyon to yours, who holde it better to take a wyfe which is of yeeres of dis|cretion, knowing how to order a house, then of these infants newly come out of y^e ground, whom you must eyther teache your self, or else appoint the~ a gouernour. And truly if any stranger should come to my house, to whom I woulde giue good entertainment, I should dye for very shame, if I should he cumbred with one of those simple sottish creatures, which knoweth neither how to aske a question, nor how to make an answeare, nor in discourse to shewe her selfe a wise and gal|lant wench, and if she be not able to perfourme that, I had rather lock her vp, and say she is sick.


Annib.
You shall neuer fynd young woman so sauory eue|ry way that may please your taste, but that liuing with you you will chaunge her manners, and frame her to your owne fancy. Touching this point, if we will consider how different the opynions of husbandes are, and how diuerse the customes of countryes are, wee shall staye too long about yt: for some are so kynde harted, that they wyshe their wyues in

any wise to gyue their freindes entertainement being in their house, thinking themselues happy to haue wyues that knowe howe to behaue themselues well in that poynte: and they are very gladde that the worlde may knowe there shineth in their house so rare and precious a pearle and iw|ell: now some on the other side are of this humour, that they thincke it a dyshonour that their wiues should bee skilfull in any thing else but in spinning and sowing: and if any stran|gers come to their houses, they either runne quickly them|selues, or send some of their me~ to giue their wiues warning to withdrawe themselues: which they do, no otherwise then the chicken doth seing the kyte comming. Compare the peo|ple of Siennna and of the Romanes together,  consider how the Seneses to do the greater honour to straungers in their houses, make their wiues present themselues, as y^e most deere thing they haue in the world: contrariwyse the Romanes in|ioyne their wyues to so stricte a life, that they seeme to bee cloistred Nunnes. In this diuersity of dealing, I will not giue any determinate iudgment: for y^e custome of each coun|trey is to be obeyed, which is to be obsrued as inuiolably as a law: neither would I y^t we shoulde dispute which of y^e hus|bandes do best, eyther they which shew their wiues, or they which shut them vp when their freinds come to their houses: mary I wil say this, that all y^e honour  all the blame which may arise either way, falleth not vpon y^e wiues, but vpon the husbandes: for y^t they do no otherwise then they are co~maun|ded to do. But returning to the first point, I reply, that a ve|ry young wife is easy to be framed to the pleasure of her hus|bande: And thoughe for some tyme her busbande muste bee fayne to bee her maister (as you sayd) to direct her, yet it doth hym good to see his preceptes redily followed, and he is proude that he hath framed her (as they say) with his owne hand, and to his owne heart. And I thinke it be for nothing else that it is counted a double payne to marry a wyddowe, but for that shee muste be firste made to forget the qualityes of her first husband, and then made to daunce after the pipe of the second.



Guaz.
Me thinkes these seconde mariages haue the taste of Colewortes twise sodden: being so much the more hurte|full, if both the parties haue been twise maryed: And there|vpon it is reported, that the husband and the wife falling out as they sate at dinner togither, the wife in spight of the hus|bande, gaue halfe the meate that was vpon the Table to a poore body that stoode by, saying, I giue it thee for my first husbandes sake: nowe the husbande tooke the other halfe, and gaue it him, saying, I giue thee this for my firste Wyues sake: and so they were fayne to dyne with drye bread.


Annib.
There is a worse inconuenience then this, for that this seconde mariage is very preiudiciall to the children of the first mariage, which are put to trie the stepmothers cru|eltye, who receiuing any blow or iniury of their husbandes, so soone as their backes are turned, reuenge themselues vp|on their children, and beate them most pitiously, that cannot doe withall.


Guaz.
He was pretily euen with his stepmother, agaynst his will, who throwing a stone at a dog, hit her: saying, it was not flung altogither in vayne.


Annib.
I will say vnto you also, that as it is better for a man to chuse a yong wife, then one in yeares, so he ought to marry while he himselfe is yong, and not to stay til his hayre waxe hoare: for being both young, they are the likelier to haue children, and the likelyer to liue to see the bringing vp of them, and in their age to inioy their seruice and comfort, what tyme the children may doe as much for their parentes, as their parentes did before for them.


Guaz.
If I be not deceiued, all this talke is besides the matter: for we haue hitherto spent the time in a discourse, which tendeth to no other end, but to teache a man to chuse a wife that is yong, well borne, well broughte vp, reasonable riche, indifferent bewtifull, of a sound and good constitution, and of a good wit and capacitie: but we haue not yet spoken a word f the manner of conuersation betweene the husband and the wife, as our purpose was to doe.



Annib.
I presuppose that to conuerse kindly w^t ones wife, it is necessary first that he bee well framed to loue her: but for that a man cannot perfectly loue y^t which he thoroughlye knoweth not, it is needefull first to learne to knowe (as we haue done) the good qualities and conditions of ones wife, and which are the good parts in a woman, whereby men are induced to loue them: likewise it is requisite for the father whiche loueth his daughter, before he marrye her, to sifte thoroughly the qualities, behauiour, and life of his sonne in lawe: for it is a true saying, that hee whiche lyghteth vppon a good sonne in lawe, getteth a good sonne: and he that meeteth with an ill one, casteth away his daughter: now the husbande knowing the goodnesse of his wyfe, being to liue with her, hee must aboue all thinges loue her moste hartelye and vnfaignedlye: for so the law of God comman|deth. That is the strong foundation whiche surely vphol|deth the mariage, and that neglected by the husbande, bree|deth hym greate shame and infamye: for not louing that, which he hath with care and diligence gotten, and once iud|ged worthy his loue, he manifestly bewrayeth himselfe to be vnconstant and fantasticall: and that he were fitter to bee matcht with Megaera, or some other of the furyes, then with a louing wife.


Guaz.
Wherein doth that loue cheifly consist?


Annib.
In this, that he be iealous of her loue.


Guaz.
I thinke you mistake, for a woman had rather haue her husbande without loue, then with iealousy?


Annib.
I speake not of that iealousy which maketh the husband doubt of some false measures in his wife, but of that which maketh him afearde to offende any way on his part: which you shal y^e better vnderstand, if you bethinke you of y^e iealousy, whereby you keepe inclosed in your hart y^e secrets of your prince, fearing continually least by your fault they should bee discouered. In like manner, the husbande ought to accompany his loue with a continuall iealousie  feare, to loose by his owne fault the fauour and good wil of his wife, assuring himselfe that that is the only preseruing remedy

agaynst that iealousie which maketh the husbande looke a|wrye, and which you ment in the beginning. Neither can he any way giue his wife a more assured signe of this honest iealousie, then in behauing him selfe towards her, in such sort as he would she should vse her selfe towards him: which doing, he shall be sure so to find her.


Guaz.
This is very good counsayle.


Annib.
Be you therefore assured that the greatest parte of the faultes committed by the wiues, take their beginning of the fault of the husbandes: who for the most part require of their wiues an exact obseruing of the lawes of marriage, but they them selues will make no account of them. For you shall see some of them, who notwithstanding they haue receiued the companie and comfort of the woman by Gods appoyntment, yet both in wordes and deedes they will vse that rigour towardes them, and vsurpe suche superioritie ouer them, as is commonly vsed towardes slaues: And if abroade they haue receiued any iniurie, their wiues are sure to goe to wracke for it when they come home: shewing them selues cowardes towardes others, and goodly men to|wardes their poore wiues. By reason whereof, it is no mar|uayle if beeing ouercome with griefe and rage, they call the diuels to helpe them, and that at that instant some las|ciuious mates take occasion to attempt her, and hope to at|taine her, for that she is then ready to followe, whatsoeuer wrath and desperation shall put in her head. But on the other side, when the wife knoweth that all the beames of her husbandes loue, fayth, and loyaltie, shine vpon her only, holding her more deere then all other earthly thinges, you shal see her consume cleane away in burning flames of loue, and cast all her care in thinking and doing that whiche she knoweth will please him. And make your account, that a friend loueth not so well his friend, a brother his brother, or a childe his father, as a wife doth her husbande: Who not onely confirmeth her selfe to his will, but wholly trans|formeth her selfe into him. Whereof there ariseth betweene them on both sides suche assurance of trust, and securitie of

minde, as maketh them liue in most contented happinesse.


Guaz.
That assurance of trust and tranquility of mind, possesseth not the hartes of all husbandes: and I am perswa|ded, y^t there are very few in the world, which (though they set a good face on the matter) assure themselues of their wiues behauiour.


Annib.
I beleeue you: but canne you tell mee whereof commeth that common distrust that menne haue in their wiues?


Guaz.
Perchaunce of the fragilitie and weaknesse of the flesh, which is attributed to most women.


Annib.
Nay rather to the weaknesse of loue, which ought to be attributed to most men. For make your count, that at the gate which suspition commeth in, loue goeth out. And if perchaunce the husbande haue some occasion giuen him to mistrust, let him examine his owne life well, and he shall finde that the occasion came by him selfe, and that he hath not vsed her as he ought to haue done: And if he shall re|pent him of it, and begin once to regarde her as the one halfe of him selfe, and to beare her vnfaigned affection, he will beginne also to bannish suspition, and to perceiue that he which loueth is beloued, and that in mutuall loue raig|neth inuiolable faith.


Guaz.
A certayne spirite telleth me, that this your rule is rather praysed then practised: For he that would ob|serue it, must let the reine lye too loose on the womans neck, and referre the care of her and his owne honour, onely to her small discretion: Which you knowe is not the custome of our countrie of Italy, where the women are looked to with most watchfull diligence.


Annib.
A dishonest woman can not be kept in, and an honest ought not. But those who take vpon them the kee|ping of their wiues honesty, suppose that the worlde will iudge the better of them for it: For they thinke that men laugh at those husbandes which giue their wiues the head too much: and they perswade them selues, that if they do not keepe them shorte, they keepe them not as they oughte to

doe: besides, they thinke this with themselues, that the wife seeing the husbande to take no care of her, wil imagine that he doth not care for her, making belike his reconing, that no man else will desire her. The other, whiche abridge not their wiues of their liberty, perswade themselues that, that is the way to keepe their wiues honest, alleaging this reason, that the wife seeing the husband make himself mai|ster of her honour, is displeased with it, and taketh no more care to keepe it: but when her honour is committed to her owne keeping, shee is carefull and iealous of it, as of that which is her owne: besides that, we naturallye are desirous of thinges whiche are forbidden vs, and wee knowe that,
She sinneth lesse, who hath free power to sinne:
And in truth she only is to bee counted honest in deede, who hauing liberty to doe amisse, doth it not: but to rid vs out of the crooked quirkes of these diuers opinyons, I am of opini|on that we must go another way to worke.


Guaz.
Which way I pray you?


Annib.
Doe you not oft times see, two Porters beare vp togither one burthen?


Guaz.
Yes mary.


Annib.
The husband and wife, are two bodyes, vpholding one onely mynde, and one honour: so that it behoueth either of them, to haue care for their part of this common honoure: and to beare it vp vprightly, there must such an indifference measure bee kepte, that the one haue no greater charge then the other, but that the one leaue to the other their iust part: taking especiall heede, that neyther of them draw this way, or that way: for if one shrinke backe any thing, it is ynough to lay the cariage in the myre. I say then, yet once agayne, that to beare this honour brauely, there is nothing that ma|keth them better in breath, then to excercise themselues in faythfull and feruent loue, which once beginning to fayle, either on the one syde or the other, this honoure forthwith falleth to the ground.


Guaz.
It behoueth you then to deuide this charge betwene

the husbande and the wife, and that you appoynt euery one their part.


Annib.
I will do so. And touching the husband, he muste know, that as christ is the head ouer man, so man is the head ouer the woman. And therefore if he follow his head in lea|ding a Christyan lyfe, in following the steppes of our Sa|uiour, and keeping his holy commaundementes, and cheefe|ly the inuiolable bonde of holy Matrimony, no doubte but she will follow her head, as the shadowe doth the body, and will take his manners and doinges for the lawe of her lyfe, and will neuer forget them: but if the husbande once change his coppie and conditions, lette him bee bolde that shee will doe the like, and followe the steppes of Helene, who is sayde to haue been chaste, so long as her husbande contented himselfe with her, and after abandoned herselfe to others, by his fault. And if he be a man of any vnderstanding, he maye soone consider that there is nothing doth more inuenome, or inrage the wife, then the dishonest lyfe of her husbande: for keeping no fayth with her, hee muste not looke that shee should keepe promise with him: for as the saying is, Hee that doeth not as hee oughte, muste not looke to bee done to as hee woulde. And I will saye vnto you, that in the iudgemente of the wise, the Adulterer deser|ueth so muche the more greeuous punishment, by how much hee oughte to surmounte his wife in vertue, and directe her by his example. Moreouer, the husbande must consider what his authoritie is, and howe farre it reacheth ouer his wife: for some of them keepe their Wiues in suche awe, that they obey them not as their Lorde and mayster, but as a Tyraunt, so that conuerting loue into feare, they make the poore women wearye of their liues, and desyrous of eath: after whiche ill intreating, not withoute iust cause, they verifye the Prouerbe, When their husbande goeth a|boute to make earth of them, they goe aboute to make fleshe without him: for the husbande muste not perswade himselfe that hee is aboue his wife, as the Prince ouer his Subiectes, or the Sheaphearde ouer his Sheepe, but

as the minde ouer the body: which are linked together by a certaine natural amitie: * but rather must consider, that in y^e beginning man was not made of the woman, but the woman of the man,  was taken, not out of the head, that she shoulde beare rule ouer man, nor out of the feete, y^t she should be tro|den down by him, but out of the side, where is the seate of the heart, to the end he should loue her hartily, and as his owne selfe. * And as, according to the opinyon of the Astrologers, the sunne, which is Lord of the starres, goeth not about the Firmament without the co~pany of Mercury: so the husband, being lorde of the wife, ought not to excercise the authoritye he hath ouer her, without the company of wisdome. The hus|band also must prouide to satisfie the honest desires of his wife, so that neyther by necessity, nor superfluitie, she be pro|uoked to dishonour: and he must remember, that both ease  disease, make women oft times vnchaste. And for so much as many learned authours haue set downe the behauyour of the husband towards the wife, it shall suffise to say, that to beare vprightly on his side the burthen of this common honour, he must accounte of his wife as his onely treasure on earth, and the moste precious Iewell hee hath: and therefore hee must take heede, that by his faulte, the pryce of her fall not: hee must also remember, that there is nothing more due to the wife, then the faythful, honest, and louing compa|nye of the husbande: hee must also vouchsafe, in signe of loue, to communicate vnto her his thoughts and counsayles: for many haue found much profite by following their wiues counsayle, yea a man is happye that hath a louing wife to impart his good fortune vnto: whose harty reioysing at it, redoubleth his ioy: and if he disclose any ill happe vnto her, she lightneth his greefe, eyther by comforting him louing|lye, or by helping to beare a part of it patientlye. Nowe if he chaunce to spye any faulte in his wife, eyther in wordes, gesture, or doinges, he must reprehende her, not reproche|fully or angerly, but as one that is careful of her honoure, and what opinyon others carry of her: and this muste bee alwayes done secretelye betweene them two, remembe|ring

the saying, That a man muste neyther chyde nor play with his wife in the presence of others: for y^t the one bewrayeth her imperfections, the other his owne follye.


Guaz.
Surely I cannot like of those which will bee still dalying with their wiues before others: for they doe therby sette other mens teeth on edge, and make their wiues lesse shamefaste and modest.


Annib.
As that is to be misliked, so is not a sower frow|ning countenaunce towardes her to be liked: for it maketh others pittie the harde life shee leadeth with him, so much, that they seeke the pleasauntest remedies for it they possibly can. Therefore I woulde alwayes haue them shewe them|selues to their wiues, both in speeche and countenaunce, gentle, and amiable, not making a ist at that reason which is alleaged, Why some women loue their louers better then their husbandes: which is, that the Louer in the presence of his Ladye, is verye curious of his behauyoure, that hee vse no vnseemelye gestures, but will bee sure to frame all his countenaunces and doinges the moste a|miablye that hee canne possiblye: whiche the Husbande doeth not, who beeing daylye in her companye, careth not what sluttishe prankes hee playeth before her, which no question maketh her like the worse of him: wherefore hee muste thinke that his wife being of delicate nature, when she seeth any such grosse inciuilitie in him, shee doeth not onelye abhorre it, but also beginneth to thinke with herselfe, that other men are more discreete and better brought vp then he: so that it standeth him vpon to be seeme|ly and modest in his doinges, least otherwise he offende the chaste thought of his wife, to whose liking he ought to con|fourme himselfe, in all honest and reasonable thinges, and to take heed of euery thing which may iustly mislike her, wher|by he shall purchase to himselfe that prayse, which the men of old time gaue to good husbandes, esteeming them more then good gouernours of countreys.


Guaz.
Now let vs heare, if it please, you the charge of the wife.



Annib.
The wyfe hath two great disauantages in y^e main|taining of this common honour. The first is, y^t where Gods law commaundeth the husband to loue his wife, y^e same law commandeth the wife not only to loue her spouse, but besids, to be subiect and obedient vnto him. And therefore they must be let to vnderstande that the sage matrones heretofore, and namely Sara, called her husbande Lord and mayster.


Guaz.
Then those haue so much the more aduantage  good hap, whose husbandes are obedient to them, submitting them selues to their commaundement.


Annib.
Tearme that rather mishap and ill luck, for y^t suche husbandes for the most part are fooles, doltes, vices, asses, beastes, and are co~monly termed wittoles, for that they be|leue so wel, y^t they make co~science to mistrust any il, though they see another and their wife in bed togither, wherof it co~|meth that their sily wiues, like a body without a head, suf|fer themselues to go astraye. And though they bee of dis|cretion and good vnderstanding, yet the worlde maketh no accounte of them: whereas contrariwise, the wisedome, va|lour, and authoritie of the husband, serueth as a buckler to defende the honour of the wife, who thereby also is hadde in more reputation.


Guaz.
Yet you see that women are glad to meete with husbandes that are gentle natured, and a little foolishe, that they may keepe them vnder.


Annib.
Those which had rather commaund ouer fooles, then obay the wise, are like to those, who had rather leade a blinde man in the waye, then followe an other, hauing his sight perfecte, and knoweth the directe way they must take: but suche wiues neede not make boast of their sufficiencye: for at this day the race of the Spartane women is worne out, and therefore it is best for them to be content, to let their hus|bandes weare the breeches.


Guaz.
A man may well giue women this good counsayle, but there be fewe of them that will be so good as followe it, and which seeke not still for soueraigntye ouer their Hus|bandes.



Annib.
It is a thing reasonable and agreeable to nature, that the stronger should commaund ouer the weaker, * Yet some women haue the right art to order thinges so wel, that the husbandes should be thought to doe amisse, if they should dispose them otherwise: Whervpon Cato was wont to say to the Romaines, We commaund ouer all the worlde, and our wiues commaund ouer vs: Neither is there any doubt, but that many Rulers ouer Cities and countreys, are ouer ruled by their wiues: but as those women knowe howe in time and place, to bee obedience to their husbands, * so there are some such restife iades, that they will not at any time be commaunded, and by their importunities, exclamations, scolding, and brawling, continually withstande their hus|bands willes, and make a mock at them, playing with them a thousand shrowed prankes, which caused a certayne King to say, that they were very fooles that would followe their wife, running away from them.


Guaz.
You put mee in mynde of that husbande, who, his wife hauing drowned her self in a Riuer, went crying along the riuer side, seeking her agaynste the streame: and being told that there was no question but that she was gone down|ward with the streame: Alas, sayth he, I cannot think it, for as in her life tyme she vsed to doe euery thing agaynste the hayre, so now in her death she is surely mounted against the streame.


Annib.
Wee will saye then, that the wife, as the weaker vessell, must obay the husbande. And as men oughte to ob|serue and keepe the lawes and statutes of the countrey: so women ought to fulfill the commaundementes of their hus|bandes, by doing whereof they become the mistresses of the house. I could here alleadge diuers vertuous women, who cloathing themselues with humilitie, haue caused their hus|bandes to cast of pride, crueltie, and other notable vices: whereof some confesse they haue pardoned their enimies, and drawne back their handes from doing vengeaunce, some to haue vndone vnlawfull bargaynes, some to haue lefte swea|ring, and other vanities, and giuen themselues to deuotion,

and the health of their soules, being perswaded and brought thereto by the earnest and honest prayers, and by the good example, and humble Christyan lyfe of their wiues.


Guaz.
Now you haue spoken of the first disaduauntage of the wife: goe I pray you to the seconde.


Annib.
The seconde is, that albeit shee see her Hus|bande shrinke vnder his burthen, and fayle in loue and loyaltie whiche he oweth her, yet she muste not doe as hee doeth, but supplye vertuouslye his defaulte: shewing to the worlde, that for her parte, shee consenteth not that this com|mon honoure shoulde be violated, but making account ra|ther that it is her part to beare all the crosse her selfe: which doing, shee shall haue double rewarde of God, and dou|ble prayse of the worlde. Whereby you maye gather, that this honoure is more committed to the diligence and fi|delitye of the wife, then of the Husbande: And though the Husbande offende God as muche as the Wife, in vyolating the sacred bande of Matrimony, yet the wife ought fyrmelye to print this in her harte, and to remember alwayes, that where the husband by this fault doth, according to the opini|on of men, but a little blemish his honour, the wife altogea|ther looseth her good name, and remaineth spotted with such infamye, that shee can neuer recouer her honoure agayne, neyther by any repentaunce, nor by amendmente of her life: let then a wise woman stop her eares agaynst the inchaunt|mentes of those which lie in wayte for her chastitie, and open her eyes to beholde this sentence, that
A woman hauing lost the name of honest wife,
No more a woman counted is, nor to remaine in life.
And to keepe more safely her honestye both in deede and in name, let her auoyd, so much as she may, the company of wo|men, that haue an ill name: who indeuour by their naughty fashions and dishonest speeches, to bring others to doe as they doe, and wish with all their hartes, that all women were like themselues: but the wife must knowe, that to fulfill the lawe which shee is bounde to, it is not sufficiente to bee ho|nest and innocent in deede, if shee doe not likewise auoyde

all suspicion of dishonesty. And if shee looke well into the matter, she shall finde small difference (in respecte of the worlde) betweene beeing naughte, and beeing thoughte naughte: Wherefore a discreete woman will flie all light|nesse and vanitie, and keepe herselfe (as it were oute of the fyre) from giuing eyther her husband or any other the least suspition in the Worlde: knowing that a woman of suspec|ted chastitye, liueth in this world but in a miserable case. And when shee heareth other women ill spoken of, lette her thinke in her mynde, what maye bee sayde of her, imagining with her selfe, that when a woman is once in an ill name, whether, it be deseruedlye, or without cause, shee hath much adoe to recouer agayne her honoure: shee muste not beare her selfe so boldly vppon her honest meaning, to thinke that God will alwayes holde his hand ouer her head: for hee often tymes suffereth a woman to bee reprooued wrongfully, for a punishmente of her lightnesse and va|nitye: by meanes whereof shee hath giuen occasyon of scan|dale and offence.


Guaz.
I graunte you well, there are women who perceiuing themselues loued of their husbandes, and ha|uing a specyall care of their honoure, keepe themselues honest: but I woulde haue you name mee but one one|lye woman for a myracle, who with all her honest mea|ning, sheweth not to the Worlde some signe of lightnesse and vanitye: and who is not well apayde to be courted, and to be taken for bewtifull: who taketh not a greate braue|rye and felicitie, in keeping their amorous suters long time in suspence betweene yea and naye, and whiche thinketh not also by these meanes to increase her re|putation.


Annib.
It is as common a matter for women to shewe themselues vaine and lighte, as for Peacockes to spreade their tayles: wherefore we must not maruaile at that which is sayde by one, When we shall haue once taken all vanitye from a woman, a man shall be able to take nothing else from her. But wherefore thinke you women are so glad to bee

courted and sued vnto, meaning not to yeelde, but to stand to their honesty.


Guaz.
I thinke that as I am not content to know my self to be an honest man, but I would haue the world to know it, and trie it to be so: so women mooued by the same ambition, loue to be courted and tried, that by their honest aunsweres, they may be knowne to the world to be honest women.


Annib.
Those same women be like these cutters, and hac|kers, who will take the wall of men, and picke quarrels to them, to shew what valyaunte fellowes they are, but they make so many frayes, that at length they are wounded and maymed, and so are caried to the spittle house: so these poore women, trusting in their cleere conscience, come to the a|mourous incounter with one,  with an other: but at length being driuen from their ward, they ly so open that they are soone venued, and so are brought into a place lesse pitifull,  much worse then the spittle house: and if they do chaunce to scape vnuenued or vnhurte, yet they leaue the worlde in doubt of their honesty. But you made no mention how there are some women who loue to be serued of louers, and sette forth themselues by all the sleightes they can, to set their seruantes and sutors the more on edge, only to spight other women, and to make them see, that they are aswell set by as they: and that by their bewty and good grace, they can win the good will of yong men vnto them.


Guaz.
Those women in my mynde pull out one of their owne eyes, to pull two from other women.


Annib.
Wee haue spoken of two occasions of their va|nitie: now we must speake of two coolerable excuses, where|by they vse to couer this fault: for some say, that God know|eth how ill they canne away with these amarous fooles, and how muche they abhorte them, but their presumption and insolency is so great, that they will loue a woman in spight of her, and that they are so afearde of them, that they dare not looke out at their doares or windowes, least they should present themselues vnto them.


Guaz.
They were better neuer go about to excuse them|selues,

then do it in such sort: for it is well known that there is no manne such an asse, but that continuall bobbes and re|pulses will make him soare away: and that if in steed of their smiling countenaunces, their wanton glaunces, their yeel|ding gestures, and other lascyuious intysing trickes, they would shew a graue looke, a demure countenance, modest gestures, and behauiour meete for an honest woman, you should see these pigeons soone forsake the doue house.


Annib.
Others vse another excuse and say (as it were vn|der Benedicite) that to withdraw their husbandes from the companye of other women, and to drawe hym to his owne house, they are fayne to suffer themselues to be followed by these amorous companions.


Guaz.
I may say vnto you, that these women take the way to make their husbandes do that, whiche they say they seeke to preuente, and like some Phisitions, make worke where all was well before.


Annib.
We will heere then briefly comprehend the sum of that we haue sayd, and admonishe the wife, that chastitie ioyned with vanity, descrueth little, or no commendation at all, but rather lieth open to the saying of King Demetrius, who hearing a married man find sault with one of his con+cubines, sayd vnto him, My concubine is a great deale more modest, then thy Penelope: so then she must take heede how she giueth men occasion to thinke sinisterly of her, eyther by her deedes, lookes, wordes, or apparell.


Guaz.
For that you make mention of apparell, I cannot but speake of the abuse which is committed now adayes in our countrey, in the ornaments and trimming vp of women: who bestow vpon garmentes all the husbandes substaunce, and in garding and trimming of them, all the dowry which they haue brought with them, which maketh me amazed at it: And that which spighteth me most, is to see that the hus|bandes not onlye consent to such excessiue charge, but also like the notable vanitie, which their wiues shew, in the las|ciuious and strumpet like dressing of their heades, whereby they make men rather laugh at them, then like of them: like

as I saw yesterday, after you went from hence, certain wo|men, whereof one had her tresses crossed, in such sort vppon her head, that they made the likenesse of two hartes bound together: from whence, went two braunches of Carnation silke, in manner of two dartes: about the hartes betweene the tresses were knytte certayne knottes of silke and of hayre, representing the amorous passion: from the crowne of her head hung a certayne labell, whiche shoke wyth euery wynd, * signifiyng the lightnesse and inconstancye of her brayne: * on her forehead the hayres made the fourme of a garland, which was set with pearles and iewels, and na|turall and artificiall flowers, in such varietie, that the gar|dens of Naples are not able to yeelde moe sortes. I re|hearse not vnto you a thousand other trifles, which dimmed and dazeled mine eyes, in such sort as certaine Mappes doe, wherein are drawne foorth in small figures, the squa|drons of horse menne, the troupes of foote menne, and the number of the pieces of artillery. Now I pray you, is al this adde made by the Wyues to please their Hus|bandes?


Annib.
To suche a goodly deuise, there lacketh but one golden worde.


Guaz.
What I pray you?


Annib.
Offence to God, hope to the amorous, destruction to the husbandes.


Guaz.
I see not how it is possible for men to maintayne their wyues in such pompeous and masking sort, but that they must let out their money to vsury, and vse many deceit|full wayes.


Annib.
I will not saye they keepe their wiues so braue by cosoning, and cutthrote bargaynes: and that otherwise they liue porely, and fare hardly, purging the sinne of pride with the abstinence of y^e mouth,  making their children dy with hunger: but though women be very curious in al their attire, yet it is the hayre that they make most ado about: and there are no sortes of ointmentes  sliber sauces, which they will not proue, to make their hayre of the brauest coolour, in

so much, that many going about to alter the colour of their haire by naughty medecines, haue wrought their owne death: but their folly at this day is so great, that notwyth|standing, by meanes of such trumpery they feele their heads to ake, and their brayne to bee distempered, yet as mur|therers of themselues, they will not giue ouer that shame|full and deadly practise: but if they knewe well, wherein consisteth the commendation and reputation of women, you knowe well they woulde not sitte vppe moste parte of the nyght, and rise betime in the morning, to bestow most part of the daye in dressing of their head, and they woulde con|sider with themselues that those which trim vp themselues least, are trimmed vp best.


Guaz.
I haue been alwayes of this mynd, that those wo+men, whose myndes are not decked with vertue, and good+nesse, are those which labour aboue others, to supply that de|fault with the decking out of the body: thinking belike to haue as good lucke as the Lapwing, who though he be but a vile bird, and liueth most in durtie lakes, yet at the mar|riage of the Eagle she was honoured aboue other birdes, because of the crowne or cop vpon her head, and of her pyed feathers.


Annib.
But it hapneth to them often times cleane contra|rie: for the multitude of ornaments couereth that litle good which is in them by nature, and the glistering of their ie|wels, dimmeth y^e shining of their vertues, especially shining so watrishly and weakely, as they doe in suche women. But it is ordinarily seene that women, though neuer so honest, are insatiable of such trifles. Whervpon it is said, that mils and women euer want something. And some haue shewed that fond desire, not only in their life time, but at their death: As one co~maunded in her testament, that the iewels she vsed to weare, should be buried with her. But contrarily, the wife of Traiane wanne her selfe great commendation, by making no account of those toyes. And if honest women would adui|sedly thinke of the matter, they should perceiue that it is not the gylt bridle that maketh the horse the better, and that

by reason of those affected follies, they liue with suspected honesty: which is shewed by the saying of a Poet, who re|prehending an honest woman that offended in this folly, com|pared her with a lewde sister of hers in this sort.

Your sister seemeth chast, by wearing chast attire.
Although her vnchast life, hath laid her chast name in the mire.
A strumpet you to terme, a man should do you wrong:
But sure vnto a strumpet, your apparell doth belong.

* I will tell you moreouer, that it is ordained by the ciuile law, that if a man offer abuse to an honest matrone, being at|tyred like a harlot, there is no remedy against him by law. Let women therefore bee carefull to apparell themselues so modestly, that they may thereby, rather please their hus|bands, then make them iealous ouer them, in attyring them|selues lightly: for they ought to consider, that menne sup+pose, that there is alway a light mind, lodged in a gorgeous body.


Guaz.
I haue noted often those dames which are so curi|ous in their attyre, to be very sluttes in their houses: and o|thers which neglect such folly, to be very good huswiues.


Annib.
It is a common saying, that one cannot drinke and whistle altogether: and therfore no maruayle, if those which spend all the day in tricking vp themselues, haue no care nor leysure to see their house well ordered: but let vs make an end of this matter, concluding, that it may rightly be sayd of these costly clad carkases, that the feathers are more worth then the byrde.


Guaz.
I thinke good then, you returne to the matter, out of the which I draue you by my digression.


Annib.
I will make short, and giue charge to the wyfe, not only to auoyd that, which may anger and displease her husband, but also to frame her selfe to do that whiche may please him: for as that glasse is nothing worth, whiche ma|keth a sad countenance seeme ioyfull, or a ioyfull, sad: so y^e woman is a foole, who seing her husbande merry, pouteth or oureth, or seing him pensiue, sheweth her selfe pleasaunte: And therefore let her be resolued to frame her selfe to the

thoughts of her husbande, and to iudge thinges sweete or sower, according to his taste: for the diuersitie of minds and manners, is nothing fit to maintayne loue and good will: let her also by sweete wordes, and louing deedes, shew vnto him all the signes of affection she can possibly: considering that some husbands hauing been accustomed to the amorous cur|tisies of other women, wil thinke y^e their wiues set no great store by the~, if they shew them not the like, or greater. And in any wise let her continue her accustomed kindnesse towards him, least by failing of her wo~t, she seeme to wax cold in good will, or by exceeding her ordinary, shee seeme to colour some crime, wherby she may driue some foolish toy into his head: which folly, if he chaunce to be possest withal, she must labor by all meanes possible to rid him of it: not doing as some foo|lish women doe, who very vndiscreetely, and to their owne great hurt, seeke to continue that suspitio~ in their husbands, that others lay siege to their chastity.


Guaz.
But whether do you thinke those women do wel, who make their husbandes priuy to it, when they are impor|tuned with any vnlawfull requests?


Annib.
Those women are commonly blamed, for that there commeth much harme by it.


Guaz.
Is it not well done, to shew her owne fidelitie, and bring to her husband securitie?


Annib.
I think it yll done: for y^t therby she doth not breede quiet, but trouble to her husband, making him doubt, leaste reuealing one loue, she conceale another:  which is worst, it breedeth a quarrell betweene the husband and louer, wherof much mischeefe may insue.


Guaz.
We loue others wel, but we loue our selues better, and therefore she were better indanger others, then herselfe: for she hath cause to doubt, least her husband should come to the knowledge of it by some other meane, and so may think ill of her, for keeping it from him.


Annib.
A wise woman wil always like better y^t her husba~d should here by y^e report of others, of y^e repulse which she shall giue to her louer, the~ to make boast of her honesty herself:  a

wise husband will hold himself therewith y^e better content,  be the more assured in his mind of his wiues honest dealing.


Guaz.
There be many which take it otherwise, and which giue not this interpretation to such concealement.


Annib.
It is very true: and therfore to auoyde this trou|ble, it behoueth an honest woman to shew her selfe so sober and chast in countenance, that no man may be so hardie to as|sayle her. For in deed Castles that come to parley, are com|monly at the poynt to render: but if she chaunce to be set vp+pon, let her make that aunswere which a vertuous Dame made to her louer in this sort, While I was a mayd, I was at the disposicion of my parentes, but nowe I am married, I stande at the pleasure of my husbande: wherefore you were best speake to him, and know his mind what I shal do. And if her husband be out of the way, let her remember alwayes to behaue her selfe, as if he were present: and to shew him at his returne, in what profitable worke of the house she hath spent her time in his absence, wherby she shall be better liked, and more commended of him.


Guaz.
A wise husband in deed will take great pleasure in such things: but that some are so testie  froward, that they will neuer be content with any thing their wiues can doe, but so take on with them, that they make them wish them selues out of the world: I would haue you teach those poor soules some remedy for that mischiefe.


Annib.
I set downe y^e remedy alredy, when I counsayled the~ to be obedient to their husbands: yet I ad besides, that by y^e example of the Phisition she seeke to cure y^e diseases of her husband by co~trary medecines. And therfore if he be rough and terrible, she must ouercome him by humilitie, if he chide, shee must hold her peace, for the answere of wise women is scilence: and she must stay to vtter her mind vnto him, vn|till he be appeased. If he be obstinate, let not her be ouer|thwart, nor do as she did, to whom her husband brought for their supper two thrushes, but she would needes haue it that they were two owsels or blacke birdes: and he replying y^t they were thrushes,  she holding y^t they were owsels, he is

his chafe, gaue her a boxe on the are:  yet for all y^e, when y^e thrushes were serued to the table, shee continued in terming them owsels, by reason whereof, y^e husbande fell to beating her againe: A weeke after, she put him in mind of his owsels againe,  continuing in her obstinacy, he was faine to fall to his old remedy. But this matter ended not thus, for at the yeeres end, she hit him in the teeth, how he beat her for two owsels: and he sayd, it was for two thrushes, but she sayd he was deciued: but she was well beaten for it againe.


Guaz.
But what do you thinke of those husbandes which will beate their wiues?


Annib.
Mary as I do of Sacrileagers, and Churche robbers.


Guaz.
Yet I remember I haue redde, I know not where, these verses.

A woman, an asse, and a walnut tree,
Bring the more fruit, the more beaten they bee.



Annib.
You redd the text well, but not the glose, which is,
He God offendes, and holy loue vndoes,
Which on his wife doth fasten churlish bloes.


Guaz.
Yet it is the opinion of a wise Authour, that a man maketh his wife the better by chastising her.


Annib.
That Authour is of no authority in this matter, for he addeth forthwith, that a ma~ by bearing with his wife, maketh himselfe better.


Guaz.
Why, may not a man beat his wife vpo~ iust occasio~?


Annib.
You say wel vpon iust occasion: for he y^t shall stay for that occasion, shall neuer beate his wife: for a man shall neuer haue occasion, whereby he may iustly beate his wife.


Guaz.
Yea but may a man beate her if shee committe any fault?


Annib.
If she commit any fault, through my fault, I am better worthy to be beaten then she, but if she do it by neg|lige~ce, with what hart can I so much as touch a hayre of her head? And if shee doe it willfully, why, I ought to rebuke her with words,  seeke to refourme her by good counsaile: I ought to lay before her, y^e shame of ill doing,  the praise of

well doing, and if this will not serue, I ought rather pati|ently to beare with her, then rigorously to hea her, I ought to consider, that she is a weake vessell, and that we who are strong, ought to beare the infirmities of y^e weake, I ought to consider, that she is flesh of my flesh, and y^t no man hath hated or hindred his owne flesh at any time, I ought to consider, y^t we ought to be comforters one of another: shall I then be|come a tormentor of her? with what face can I imbrace that body, that my hands haue bruised and battered?  with what hart can she loue y^e man that can find in his hart to beat her


Guaz.
Well, I perceiue you wil be a louing husband, le vs go forward: and tell me, if on the wyues parte there bee any other thing, whereby she may continue loue and good will betweene her husbande and her, and maintayne vntou+ched that common honour we haue spoken of.


Annib.
A woman cannot possibly do any thing that may make her husbande more in loue with her, then to play the good huswife in her house: for it not only doth him good to see his wife so thriftilye giuen, but besides, he conceiueth a+firme opinyon of her honesty, seeing her take paines and ex|ercise her body in workes belonging to the house, whereby she getteth a liuely naturall colour, and that vertuous ver|milion, which falleth of neither with sweating, neither with weeping, nor with blowing, nor with washing: whiche ma|keth him denye her no necessary thing belonging to y^e house, when he seeth her so careful to kepe the~ in good order, which is not y^e fashion of thse light huswyues, who liue witho doing any thing, without caring for husband, childre~, or any thing belonging to y^e house: shewing manifestly, y^e though the body be in the house, yet y^e mind is abroad, foundeth to their owne shame,  their husbandes disprofit: for it is well knowne, that when the mistres is occupied in vanities, the seruauntes take little care of her profite, but looke to their own matters: as the co~mon saying is, While y^e mistres plai|eth, y^e mayd strayeth. And as y^e wyfe ought busily to looke a|bout her, in her house: so it is vnseemly for the husband to|meddle with matters within dores: but if his hap be so ill, to

haue a foolish wyfe, which sleepeth (as they say) her eies be|ing open, you know it standeth him vpon, to supply y^e imper|fection of his wife; but those men are to be laughed at, who hauing wise  sufficient wiues, wil (as they say) set hens a|broade, seaso~ y^e pot, dresse the meate, teach y^e chamber mayds,  take their wiues office from her, such husbands offe~d their wiues much, shewing y^t either they mistrust the~, or contemn the~: besids; they do wrong to the~selues,  shew therby y^t there is but  in the~ for if they were imployde abroade in mat|ters of importance, belonging to me~ of discretio~, they would, being come home, be more desirous to take their ease, then to trouble their wife and seruants, in medling with their mat|ters. And they would co~sider with themselues, y^t the rule of y^e house belongeth to the wife,  y^t God hath made wome~ more feareful then me~, to the end they should be more fit for y^e wa|ry watching  keeping of the house: whereto a carefull feare is very requisite. I deny not, but the husband ought to know how matters goe in his house; to prouide abrode for thinges accordingly,  now  then to correct some faultes, which his wife perchaunce eyther will not or cannot: but it is reason that she being, as it were, y^e sterne of the house, the husbande should co~mit the whole gouernment of it vnto her, as a thing belonging vnto her: for the rest you must knowe, that as in aduersitie and trouble, true friendes are knowne, so the Wife cannot by any meanes more continue the good will betweene her spouse and her, and bynde them, as it were, to her for euer, then by sicking to him faithfully in his neede and aduersitie, which some of them doe not, who will pertake gladly with the prosperities and ioyes of their husbands; but they wil not willingly take part of their trou|bles: forgetting the example of the fayre  wise wife of Me|thridates, who for her husbands sake, causing her head to be polled, and framing her selfe to ride, and weare armure, like a ma~, accompanied him valiantly, faithfully,  patie~tly, in al his troubles  perils, which gaue Methridates wonderfull co~fort in his aduersitie,  gaue the world to vnderstand, that there is nothing so troublesome  greeuous, but that the two

hearts of the husband and the wife lincked togither, are abe to support it. And therefore when the husbandes are afflicted with any infirmity either of mind or body; let the wiues bee ready, both in word and deed, to comfort and to attend them: whereby they shall see their loue and affection will growe more feruent and faithfull. For conclusion, the husband and the wyfe muste count all thinges common betweene them: hauing nothing of their owne in particulr, no not so much as the body it selfe: and laying aside pryde, they must cheerefully set their handes to chose thinges that are to be done about y^e house, belo~ging to their calling,  to striue in well doing one to ouercome another: whereof will growe such conte~ted quietnesse, as will happily prolong their liues to old age: and by the bond of loue  concorde, they shal giue their children an example to liue in vnitie one with an other, and their seruauntes to agree together in the dispatche of their businesse, and discharge of their duties.


Guaz.
For so much as you haue made mention of children, I should like well y^t from henceforth, according to our deter|mination, you come to speake of the conuersation betweene y^e parents  the children: for I think it a matter very expedie~t, to set down y^e orders which they ought to obserue in conuer|sing togither, for y^e euen amongst the~, there is not for y^e most part found that good agreeme~t, and y^e discrete dealing which ought to be:  that the world is now come to this passe, y^t the child is no sooner come to any vnderstanding, but that he be|ginneth to cast in his head of his fathers death: as a little childe riding behind his father, sayde simply vnto him, Fa|ther, when you are dead, I shal ride in the Saddle: yea there are many great knauish children, which wish and worke the death of their fathers: whereof I know not well to whom to impute the fault, either to the fathers, which keepe not their children in such awe, neyther bring them vp in such sorte as they ought to do, or to the children, who know not how much they are beholding to their fathers.


Annib.
And which of the~ in the end rather conclude you to be in the fault?



Guaz.
Marye the Childe, who can not bring an action agaynst his father, though he do him neuer so great wrong.


Annib.
Why, sayd you not but now, that the child often times knoweth not his duty to his father?


Guaz.
Yes mary did I.


Annib.
To whom wil you giue the charge, to make the child know and vnderstand that duty?


Guaz.
To the Father.


Annib.
Then reuoke your first sentence, and conclude that the fault is in the father, who ought to haue infourmed him in his duty.


Guaz.
If the father giue his sonne good lessons,  he will not hearken vnto them, what can he doe more? if the Father offereth instructions with the right hand,  the childe recei|ueth them with the left hand, what fault is the Father in?


Annib.
If the father in time teach him to vse his right ha~d, he will neuer grow to be left handed: but it is no marueile, if hauing suffered him to vse that ill custome a long tyme, he cannot afterwardes take it from him: And therefore hee ought to accuse his owne negligence, for that he hath defer|red till euening, to giue him hose instructions whiche hee should haue giuen him earlye in the morning at the Sunne rysing, euen together as it were with the milke of y^e Nurse: not considering that in tender mindes, as it were in waxe, a man may make what impression he lift.


Guaz.
I know not, how you can excuse the children, who after the father hath nourished and brought them vp careful|ly, vnder the charge of learned men and instructed them in the faith of Christ, in the end run astray, and liuing lewdlye, bring foorth fruite vnworthy their good bringing vp.


Annib.
That happeneth very sieldome,  though it do hap|pen, yet for al y^t the fathers are not discharged of the care o|uer them, which God himselfe hath inioyned them to.


Guaz.
I marueile not so much y^t a child vertuously brought vp, sometime falleth out naught, or if therevpon afterwardes ariseth discord betwene his father  him, for y^e vnlikenesse of manners may be the cause of it: but I count it strange,  as

it were agaynst nature, y^t both y^e father  y^e sonne, being both honest men, and for their good dealing wel spoken of by all men, it shal often fall out, that they cannot agree together in the house, but liue in continuall strife, and dissention: and a|greeing well in publike affayres, still disagree about house|hould matters: whereof I could bring you many examples.


Annib.
You sayd but erewhile, that the child ought not to commence an action agaynst the father, if you will stand to that sentence, you must needes confesse that the sonne, how honest soeuer he be, doth not honestly, when he withstandeth his father, and conformeth not himselfe to his pleasure.


Guaz.
I auow and make good, that the sonne ought to suffer the father to commaunde ouer him, and that hee ought to obay him without any resistaunce: but that their conuer|sation may frame the better, I thinke it necessarye, to ap|pointe to the father, how he ought to proceed in his fatherly iurisdiction, y^t he exceede not y^e bonds of reason, and giue not his sonne cause (if not to oppose himselfe against his plea|sure) yet to find fault w^t him in his hart,  to think himself ill delt withal by him, by means wherof, he waxeth cold  faint in y^e loue  reuerence which he ought to beare to his father.


Annib.
I can neuer forget y^e vndoubted saying, y^e fewe chil|dren are like the father,  that many of them are worse: and y^e those which are better, are very rare  thin sowed. I would haue vs first therfore serch out y^e cause, why so fewe children resemble the father,  answere to y^e hope he co~ceiueth of the~, whereof ariseth disagreement betweene them,  by y^t meane we shal better vndersta~d what their conuersatio~ ought to be.


Guaz.
With all my hart.


Annib.
First it is to be considered, that children bring smal or no comfort vnto their parents, if nature  fortune bee not well tempered in them.


Guaz.
How so?


Annib.
As a fruitful graine sowed in a soyle vnfit for it, bringeth forth no increase, so a child which is naturally giue~ to learning, shal neuer do well if he be giuen to warfare, so much it importeth to finde out in the beginning, whereto he

is most inclined. Touching this matter, I remember I haue read certayne verses of Dant, whiche I haue nowe for|gotten.


Guaz.
You shall see I will helpe you.


Annib.
I pray you doe.


Guaz.
If that men had more care to follow natures lore,
Of able  acco~plisht men, we should haue greater store,
But contrary, a Priest of him we vse to make,
Who borne is for the war, wherin he cheefe delight doth take,
And him we make a King, whom nature hath ordaind,
A Lawier for to be, and thus is natures course restraynd.


Annib.
What pleasure I take in these verses, as well for their delightfull harmony, as for that they giue me to know how good a memory you are indued withall: Here you see expressed one of the occasions of the vntowarde successe of children.


Guaz.
It behooueth fathers to vse discretion in this point, to finde out, as soone one way, as soone another, the naturall instinct of their children: which is best knowne in their in|fancye, as the prouerbe is, That by the morning it maye bee gathered, how all the day will proue after. And I thinke this most necessary respect, to be little respected by some fa|thers, who force their childre~ to enter into that trade of life which is altogeather contrary to their naturall inclination, and therefore no maruayle though they receiue small comfort of them: for thereof insueth many times the dishonoure of their house, and which is worse, greate offence towardes God: as when poore gyrles are put into religious houses, who euen from their mothers wombe desired to be married.


Annib.
Those fathers which set their children to thinges contrary to their disposition, are rather to be pittied then blamed, for that it happeneth commonly for lacke of taking heede: but these which thrust them into religious houses, before they are of yeares to chuse or refuse that life, are no doubt greatly to be blamed: for that they bring their chil|dren to it, eyther through feare, or through false perswasio~s: which is nothing else, but to withstand the will of God, and

to take from their children that free choyse which hee of his diuine goodnesse hath promised them. And therefore if the Father be carefull of the honoure and quyet of his house, lette him bee also carefull to knowe whether his sonnes mynde bee giuen eyther to learning, or to armes, or to hus|bandrye, or to Merchaundise: And where hee shall per|ceiue hee hath drawne him out of his righte waye, lette him make him returne into it forthwith, and set him agayne where he would be, otherwise let him assure himselfe that a thing ill begun, will come to a worse ende.


Guaz.
Seeing we are to search the cause, why children oftentimes fall not out according to the hope and opinyon of their parents: you had neede begin at the milke which they suck, for y^t the nurses milke is of such force, y^t the vse thereof, maketh the childe take more after the Nurse, then the Mo|ther which brought him into the world. And when I remem|ber the custome of diuers women in Fraunce, who bring vp their Infantes only with the milke of beastes: I think ther|of it commeth, * that diuers of them are so fierce and cruell, that by theyr yll lyfe, they shewe themselues scarse to bee indued with that reasonable parte whiche is pro|per to menne: With the good leaue of the good bee it spoken. *


Annib.
I am out of all doubte of the maruaylous effects of the Milke, and it is a thing most certayne, that if a lambe bee nourished with the Milke of a Goate, or a Kid with the milke of a yeaw, the Kid will haue a very soft hayre, and the Lambe a very rough and hayry Wooll. And therefore it is to be thought, that as the chylde, by reason of the Milke, taketh after the complexion of the Nurse, so the disposition of the mynd, followeth the complexion of the body: And therof also it commeth, that the daughters of honest women, prooue altogether vnlike them, both in body and mynde, so that to deliuer children from their mothers to Nurses, cannot be sayd to be other then a corrupting of nature. But if we shoulde make mention of this fyrste Nourriture, wee shoulde haue spoken of it then, when wee discoursed of vn|fortunate

Mariages: but I neyther spake of it there, ney|ther will doe here, for that the Philosophers, and speciallye Galen, haue spoken so pertinentlye, and so sufficientlye, of the force and vertue of the milke, that we neede to make no farther question of it. I forbore also to speake of it, for that women at this daye are so curious of their comlinesse, or rather of their vanitie, that they hadde rather peruerte the nature of their Children, then chaunge the fourme of their fyrme, harde, and rounde pappes, whereof it commeth, that the children fashioning themselues to the humoures of their Nurses, swarue from the loue and duetye whiche they owe to their mothers, and haue not in them the blood whiche mooueth them to obay or respecte them any thing, whiche is manifested by an example of a Bastard, of the house of the Gracchi, who returning from the warres, la|den with the spoyles of the enimie, had his mother and his Nurse comming before him, hee gaue to his Mother a Siluer ring, and to his Nourse a Coller of Golde: whiche his mother misliking with, hee tolde her she was to blame to doe so, saying: You bore me but nyne Monthes in your belly, but my Nurse kept mee with her teates the space of two yeares: That which I holde of you, is my body, whiche you gaue me scarse honestly, but that whiche I haue of her, proceeded of a pure and sincere affection: so soone as I was borne, you depriued me of your company, and banished mee your presence, but she graciously receiued mee, vanished as I was, betweene her armes, and vsed mee so well, that shee hath broughte mee to this you see. These reasons, with others, which I wil not rehearse, stopped his mothers mouth, being full ill ashamed, and made his louing Nurse farther in loue with him.


Guaz.
Seeing these women will not bee the whole Mothers of their Children, they oughte at leaste to bee carefull to chuse good Nurses, and well complexi|oned.


Annib.
As the fyrste abuse crepte in, to sette oute their Children to Nurse: so consequently followed the seconde

not to respect the nature of the Nurse. But let vs go for|warde to shew the occasions of y^e difference betweene the fa|thers and the children, holding for certayne, that the princi|pall proceedeth (as we haue already sayde) of the difference betweene the nature of che childe, and the seate and trade of life he is set to. And therefore I say, that it is not ynough for the Father to know whereto the Childe is naturallye giuen, if afterwardes he indeuour not to make him the waye playne to assist him, and carefully to prouyde for all things, meete to conduct him safely to the end which he hath propo|sed to himselfe. Another cause of this difference between the father and the chylde, is, when the Father loue~th himselfe better then his child, keeping him with him, to play withall, without taking any keepe to set him to maisters, which may instruct him in learning, or to the court, or to those professy|ons whereto he shall be most inclined: Wherein many wel|thy fathers greatly offende, who bearing themselues bolde vpon their goods, neuer take care to bring vp their children in learning and vertue, but suffer their wits so to be dulled with idlenesse, and gluttony, that (as the prouerbe is) They know not Chaffe from Corne, or Chalke from Cheese: and they growe to haue as good iudgement as the Asse, whiche iudged the Coockoes singing, to bee more sweete then the Nightingales.


Guaz.
The more the Father keepeth his Children aboute him, the more hee maketh their manners like to his.


Annib.
You are deceiued, for the life of the olde father, is no patterne for the young sonne, to shape his doinges by: and besides, in time he will accuse his Father, for that ha|uing opportunity to send him abroad to get wealth and esti|mation, he kept him at home, and thereby hindred his prefer|ment.


Guaz.
The child ought rather to thinke well of him for it, and to attribute it to too much loue.


Annib.
Nay rather to too little loue: for disordinate af|fection is not to be counted true loue.



Guaz.
The more deere a thing is vnto you, the more care|full you are to keepe it about you, and to ioyne it as it were to your hart.


Annib.
It is true: but let me aske you, why couet you in keepe long a good seruant?


Guaz.
Mary for my profite.


Annib.
If he were called by some prince, to some hygher degree, would you not giue him leaue to go from you?


Guaz.
Yes willingly.


Annib.
Why?


Guaz.
For his preferment.


Annib.
You then shew him greater signe of good will, in letting him go from you, then in keeping him with you: for that thereby, you preferre his profite before your owne: by the same reason, the father keeping his child with him, shew|eth that he loueth better himselfe, then his chylde: for if he loued him as he should do, he would also loue his preferme~t, and would seeke to better his estate: liking better that hee should dye like a horse in battayle, then liue like a hogge in the mire.


Guaz.
And what would you say, if the father being lear|ned kept his sonne wyth him, to make hym pertaker of his knowledge?


Annib.
I made no mention of such fathers, for that they are very rare, which are indued with learning sufficient to perfourme such a matter: And if there be any such, yet they wil not, or they cannot take any such payne, nor tye them|selues to such a charge, hauing other businesse, mary if they would vndertake it, there is no doubt but great good would come of it, for that the father would instruct the childe more carefully, and the child would receiue it more heedefully of his father, then of his maister: And it ought to seeme no straunge president neither: For Cato the Censor, taught himselfe, and brought to great perfection his sonne, without the helpe of any gouernour or mayster. And Octauian Au|gustus being Emperour, tooke no scorne to teache his two adoptiue sonnes. But the iniquity of our time is such, that

men would counce it a monstrous thing, to see a father, be|ing a gentle man, to teach his sonnes.


Guaz.
The shame is the greater of those, who being nei|ther able, nor willing to teache their children themselues, take no care to put them out to be instructed by others.


Annib.
A man may see they know not the difference be|tweene the learned and the ignorant: and that the ignorant in comparison of the learned, are worse then dead.


Guaz.
Yet for all that the abuse is such, that the rich men of our time will not haue their sonnes breake their heades with study, and in a manner mislike that they should learne to reade: for I know many of these, rich in liuing, but poore in learning, which get them into the shoppes of Merchantes and Apoticaries, to the boyes and Prentises there, to haue them write letters for them to their friendes: wherein they bewray at once both their secrets, and their ignorance: O what a goodly sight is that? but I wil not forget to tel you, that being not long since in an Aduocats study, I heard a clarke of his (who had closed vp a letter which he had writ|ten for a gentleman there present) aske the gentleman the name of him to whom he should direct y^t letter, that he might put it in the superscriptio~: who answered him, That he need write nothing else but, To my Gossip at Cremone: but the clarke replying that it was necessary to specifie his name that the letter might come to the handes of his Gossip, hee sayd it was no matter for his name, it was ynough to say (to his Gossip) for that euery man knew him.


Annib.
I beleeue he was a gentleman, because you name him so, but in this dotishe simplicity, he shewed hymselfe as very a clowne, as one that I wyll tell you of, who, as the Phisition askt hym what countrey manne he was: hee aunswered, that he shoulde see that by his water. These riche folke withoute learnyng, or rather bodyes without myndes, are termed by Diogenes, sheepe with golden fleeces: And therefore they ought to bee more carefull to instructe their children in learning. For as the poore are driuen to study by necessity: so the rich are hindred from

it by superfluitye: and they consider not vntyll it be to late, that learning is more necessarye for them, then for the poore, for that they haue more dealinges in the worlde, and haue neede of more witte to keepe their ryches, whiche, as brittle, frayle, and corrupti|ble, can hardlye last, without they bee conserued with the sweete syrrope of wisedome. And it is, most certayne, that a man liueth better with a little, gotte~ by vertue, than with a grea deale giuen by fortune. And those which wax proude through aboundaunce of riches, shewe themselues not to know what happened to the goord which made his bragges that he was gotten aboue the pine tree: but those which are wise, the richer they are, the better they will consider how riches are gotten with trauayle; kept with feare, and lost with greife, and, that he whiche putteth his trust in them, shall bee deceaued: for the true riches are those whiche cannot bee lose, being once gotten. And therefore discreet fathers will be carefull to bring vp their children in lear|ning, perswading them that they are neuer rich, vntill they be learned: remembring alwayes the example of Philip King of Macedon, who so soone as his sonne Alexander was borne, wrote letters to Aristotle, signifiyng the ioy which he fe, not so much for that he had a sonne, as for that he was borne in his time, to whose instruction and gouern|ment he had already appointed him: which maketh me vppon iust casion o of charity with this our age, which maketh so smal account of those men, who, not only instruct vs in learning, but in life also, which are the two greatest goods that can be desired in this world. And therfore it is so far of, that they should be dispised, that they ought to be reuerenced as much as our owne fathers. But for that there are many maisters excellent in learning, and yet lewd in life, the fa|ther must be very wary in the choise of them, least what his sonne getteth one way, he looseth another way, for hee must haue as greate care to make hym vertuous, as lear|ned, and hee muste haue more care to make hym good, then to leane hym goodes: for as one sayd. If thy sonne bee

wise  honest, thou shalt leaue him goodes ynough: but if he be a foole, thou shalt leaue him to much: For fooles are not fit to possesse riches. Now, if the childe be not giuen to lear|ning, the father must not fayle, continually to imploy hym some other way: for there is nothing more dangerous then an idle young manne. And as that tree which blossometh not in spring tyme, bringeth foorth no fruite in haruest so hee shall neuer come to liue honestly, when he is a man, who is not vertuously exercised, while he is a childe: but a|mongest other occasiones of the ill successe of children, this is one, when the father is carelesse to make them in tyme raise themselues from the ground.


Guaz.
What meane you by that?


Annib.
That the father being carefull of his sonnes ad|uauncement, is many times so curious to see him thorowly instructed in worldly matters, that, forgetting how the be|ginning of wisdom, is the feare of god, he taketh no care at all to instructe hym in the Christian Faith: whereof it commeth that this vnhappy chylde, trayned vp altoge|ther in worldly affayres, and depriued of the true lyghte, can not see the righte waye, but runneth into perdition.


Guaz.
Nowe you hit the marke right: for the wisedome of the world is folly with God. And it is a thing impossible for him to liue well, who knoweth not God.


Annib.
To this Christian admonition agreeth that which the diuine Philosopher Plato saith, where he  a|gainst fathers, which shew them solues ignorant what theyr ought to do, trotting vp  downe this way and that way, ca|sting all their care to heape vp much wealth,  taking so litle care for the children who must possesse it, that they exercise them neither in the vertue of iustice, nor of liberalitie, wher|by they may be able to distribute, se,  bestow their goods as they ought to doe. Which doing, it may be sayde, that they prouide for thinges superfluous, and neglecte thinges necessarie. Whiche the Persians knewe well, who though they were ignoraunt of the true worship of God, yet they

were carefull aboue al things to haue their children instruc|ted in iustice and vertue. I would then haue parentes take care both for the minde, and the body of their children: But for that the minde is more excellent, it is reason to cast our chiefest care vpon it. And for that the minde in infantes is like a payre of tables, wherein nothing is written, and like  tender twig which may be bowed euery way, it is cleare, that vertue or vice may easily be planted in it. And for that it is knowen by proofe, that those things are kept best in me|morie which are learned in youth, fathers ought to instruct their children in the best thinges, that is, in the feare and loue of God: Holding it for a generall rule, that he whiche knoweth euery thing, and knoweth not God, knoweth nothing.


Guaz.
For that the fathers eyther will not, or cannot be alwayes with their chyldren, to keepe them in the right way, they ought to prouide maysters for them, no lesse god|ly then learned, who euery day at conuenient times may teache them some deuout prayers, and instruct them in the feare of God: not ceassing in their ordinary lectures to min|gle alwayes some diuine preceptes. For imprinting in their tender hartes deuocion and religion, it wil, while they liue, continue them in godlinesse, and after their death, it wil vnite them to Christ.


Annib.
You say very well: And if the father bee diligent to instructe his children in the law of God, hee shall get this also by it, that his children thereby will do hym the more honour and reuerence: knowing that it is Gods commaun|dement they shoulde do so. To the former occasion of the ill successe of chyldren may bee added this, when the father setteth before them a stained and spotted glasse to looke in, that is, when he himself giueth them il example: Which the Romanes were very circumspect in, whose modesty  discre|tion was so great, that the father would neuer hath himselfe in the companye of his sonne: and it was counted a greate faulte in the father, to suffer himselfe to bee seene naked by his sonne: no marueyle then, though Cato the Censor

put Manlius out of the Senate, onelye for kissing his Wife in the presence of his Daughter, whereby wee maye see, that it is not ynough for the Father to ap|poynte good Maysters ouer his Chyldren, and to see them well instructed, if aboue all thinges hee bee not cyrcumspecte to shewe himselfe suche before them, as hee wisheth to haue them to bee: for the Mayster doeth them not so muche good by his good instructi|ons, as the Father doeth them harme by his euill Example, for that they are by nature lead rather to followe his steppes, then the maysters preceptes: for it is so naturall a thing for the sonne to resemble the Father in gamening, in swearing, and in other vices, that if by chaunce some childe doe not followe his Father in them, but liueth vertuouslye and honestlye, yet the worlde wyll scarse beleeue that hee doeth so, by rea|son of the euill opinyon they haue conceyued of the Fa|ther, but will rather thinke that the Chylde is heyre to his vyces, as well as to his Landes: And when they canne fynde no faulte with hym anye waye, some or other will not sticke to hitte hym in the teeth, that hee was the sonne of the naughtiest man in the worlde. Likewise, if the Father bee honest, and the sonne lewde, the Fathers good name is called in questyon, and men thinke it in a manner impossible, that the sonne shoulde treade awrye, vnlesse hee were by his Father lead a|wyre. And therevppon it is thoughte, that if some Romane Gentlemen vsed too extreame seueritye towards their Chyldren, they didde it not so muche vppon the displeasure whiche they conceyued agaynste them, as for the care they hadde of their owne renowne, and the desyre to mayntayne their credite and reputation. I woulde therefore haue the Father to frame hymselfe to lyue well, and orderlye, as well for hys owne sake, as for the honoure and benefite of his Chyldren, who seeing the Uertue which shyneth in their Fathers deedes, feele themselues mooued with desyre to immitate hym,

and seeing those of the house which stande quietlye and reuerently wayting vpon him, to be ready at the holding vp of his fynger to execute his commaundementes, they thereby take example to doe their duetye lykewyse, and not to bee inferioure in obedyence to Seruauntes and Straungers: and besides, indeuour to be like in deedes to their Father, that they maye in tyme to come, receiue the lyke reuerence of their Seruauntes, as they see their fa|ther doeth of his: for the Father which giueth an ill ex|ample to the chylde, in tyme shall be had in contempte by the Chylde, and abandoned of him, so that he shall ney|ther receyue succoure of him in his latter dayes, nor in his last day, that last duty to cloase vp his eyes: Besides the father by liuing disorderly and dishonestly, manye tymes make a hande of those goods, whiche the children shoulde liue by.


Guaz.
That agreeth with this.

Children many tymes are made for to weepe,
By reason of the ill rule their fathers did keepe.



Annib.
Yea, there are some cases wherein the seelye Infantes, which haue not offended, are punished for their Fathers faulte: And thinking to my selfe, that lawe to be too rigorous, I asked one daye Mayster Frauncis Beccio the occasion whiche mooued the Emperour Iustinian to sette downe any such seuere lawe: and amongest a greate manye reasons which hee aleaged vnto mee, this was the cheefe, That the Father naturallye fearing the ill of his Children, more then of himselfe, will the better keepe himself from co~mitting suche offences, whereof his children shall beare the punishment: whereby we may know, that the ill life of the father, bringeth to the Children both loffe and shame, and that he must not perswade him, that it is ynough to giue his children good counsayle, vnlesse his deedes bee agreeable thereto: for the children respecte not so muche that which the father sayth, as that which he doth: like as the Crauish somtime did, Who, his mother telling him that it was very vnseemely for him to go arsewarde; as hee die;

aunswered: Doe you leade mee the waye otherwyse, and you shall see I will followe you. And therefore hee that desyreth to amende his Children, muste fyrst amende hymself, and by the example of piety, charity, iustice,  other vertues, make them charitable, iust, and vertuous, and when he shall walke vpright by himselfe, hee maye boldlye take vp others for haulting, lyke as Dionisius some|tyme didde, who taking his sonne in a faulte, sayde vnto him, Haste thou euer seene mee commit the lyke faulte? No (sayth his Sonne) you had no king to your fa|ther: whereto he replyed, Neyther shalt thou haue a king to thy sonne: as it fell out in deede, for in the ende, for his cru|eltye, and Tyranny, he was driuen out of his kingdome, and was constrayned by necessitie to go rouing vp and downe, vntill hee founde meanes to teache children, and keepe a schoole. Let vs nowe passe to the other occasions of the infortunate conuersation betweene the father and the chylde, whereof there are two, which now come in my mynd: the one is, when the father is more then a mother: the other, when he is more then a father.


Guaz.
Howe meane you that he should be more then a mother?


Annib.
When he is so blinded that he seeth not the im|perfections of his childe, or if hee see them, yet is readye to commende them, or to excuse them, in such sorte, that if his sonne be haughty, or harebrained, he termeth him couragi|ous: if he be base minded, he counteth him modest: if a pra|ting boye, hee will haue him, on Gods name, to be an O|rator: and in flattering thus himselfe, hee frameth, in his imagination, the best childe in the worlde: with the whiche blindnesse, the fathers of one onlye childe are for the moste part stroken. I must needes in this place mention vnto you, a youth of fyfteene or sixteene yeares of age, of a readye witte, but otherwise vicious, dissolute, and lewde of life, by the fault of the father and mother, who are so farre from correcting him, that they dare not so muche as threaten him, nor saye anye worde to him,

whiche maye displease him: And I remember, when he was fyue or sixe yeres olde, if anye tolde them that they muste rebuke him for some faulte whiche he hadde done, they would excuse him by and by, saying hee was not yet of age to knowe his fault: And beeing seuen or eyghte yeeres olde, they woulde neuer beate hym, nor threaten him, doubting leaste through great feare and perturba|tion of the spirites, his blood shoulde bee chaufed and inflamed, whereby hee mighte bee cast into an ague: No at tenne yeeres old, they thought not good to trou|ble or molest him, aleaging that strypes and threates mighte pull downe his courage too muche, and take from hym his Noble stomache: And though nowe for his naughtye conditions hee bee hated of the whole Towne, yet they leaue not to excuse hym styll, saying, hee must fyrst growe, and then after bee wyse, and that within these fewe dayes they will sende hym to Schoole, where hee shall learne witte. I looke nowe, when hee shall bee of age to bee hanged on the Gallowes, to heare him before the people to laye the fault on his Fa|ther and mother, and iustlye to curse their foolishe loue, and shamefull cockering and sufferaunce: attempting, as once one didde, to teare their Noase or their eares of with his teeth.


Guaz.
Thereby it is seene, that a chylde, though of neuer so good a witte, yet beeing ill broughte vp, proo|ueth too bad: but I looked you woulde haue tolde, that in the ende hee hadde beaten his Father to make him a|mendes: or that hee had driuen him out of the house, as the Serpent was by the Irchin: for to giue a childe so greate libertye, is to putte weapons into his hand, whiche often tymes hee vseth agaynste his parentes: but this greate cockering and compassion is proper to the mother, who commonlye bringeth vp her chyldren with more tender affection then discretion. And there are few to bee seene at this daye, whiche, by the example of the Spartane women, haue the heartes to saye to theire

children in deliuering them a Tergate, Come no more in my sighte, but eyther with this retourning victoryous from the field, or vppon this, being brought dead out of the fielde, but rather goe about to withstand the honourable thoughtes and enterprises of their children, and woulde haue them both in countenaunce and conditions, like to women.


Annib.
It is a hard matter for a mother to be fond of her children, and wise both together.


Guaz.
But the right loue is to beate and correcte them, when they shall deserue it, and as the Poet sayth,
The rod doth not make lesse the mothers loue.


Annib.
If the excesse of loue be to be blamed in the mo|ther, much more is it to be reproued in the father: whose part it is to examine and correct his childrens faultes: assu|ring himselfe that the only way to spyll them, is to bee too fond and tender ouer them.


Guaz.
But whiche are those fathers, you call more than fathers?


Annib.
Those which are too cruell to their children, and beate them continually like slaues, for the least fault in the world.


Guaz.
Truly those fathers are mislyked of all men: for that withoute discretion they measure theyr children by themselues, and requyre at their handes a matter impossible, which is, to haue them be old in their youth, not suffering them to inioy in any sort, that liberty whiche is alowed to their age: And in my mynde, they deserue no other name then of Schoolemaisters, for that they cannot manner their children well, vnles they haue a rod in their hande: for if they were right fathers, they would be content that their children should learne of them, to know that the whole drift of humane lawes, is nothing else but to refraine from doing ill,  to vse to do that which is good and honest, which a childe is brought to, rather by loue, than by force: but the authoritie which some ignorant fathers take vppon them, is

so great, that without respecting age, place, time, degree, fashion, or any thing, they wyll keepe their children vnder by force, and make them do euery thing con|trary to their owne myndes, yea euen to weare their apparell after the fashion of the good men of the time past.


Annib.
It is most certayne, that they do amisse in that, whereby they make their children not to loue them so hartely, and to obay them rather for feare, then affection: besides, they consider not that the beating without mea|sure, and the keeping them in continuall feare, is the cause that a manne cannot iudge to what manner of life they are naturally inclined. Moreouer, it dulleth their wittes, and represseth their naturall vigour, in such sort, that there is no mettall left in them, and by fearing alwayes to fayle in their doinges, they neuer but faile in them, and comming in any company, they know neyther which way to looke, nor what to do. Therefore they ought to leaue their butche|ry beating, and consider rather that for the lacke of yeeres their chidren cannot haue perfect vnderstanding and expe|rience in things, wherby they are to be borne withal, when they do amisse.


Guaz.
I like those fathers well, who can keepe their children in awe, only with shaking their head at them, or v|sing some such like signe: and can only with a word correct them, and make them ashamed of their faulte. But I am perswaded that there are few fathers, that know how to keepe the meane, but that they will eyther bee to rough, or to gentle to their children, whereof as the one driueth them to desperatnesse, so the other bringeth them to disso|lutenesse.


Annib.
We must thinke that a childe hath giuen vnt him a father and a mother, to y^e end that of the wisdom of the one, and the loue of the other, that Meane which you meane may be made: and that the seueritie of the father, may bee somwhat mitigated by the lenitie of the mother.


Guaz.
You may in my opinyon yet adde one occasion

more of the disagreement between the father and the childe, which is the partiall loue of the father towardes his chyl|dren.


Annib.
Do you take that to be a fault?


Guaz.
Do you thinke it reasonable, that hee should im|brace and loue one more than an other? and that all be|ing of his fleshe and blood, he shoulde cast a merry coun|tenaunce vppon some of them, and a seuere looke vppon other some.


Annib.
Of the sonnets,  other co~positions which you haue made, is it well done of you to like some better then other some? yea and perchaunce those which are worst, best: And be you assured also, that your father loueth not all his chil|dren alike, and yet he of you whom he loueth least, cannot iustly complayne of him.


Guaz.
I giue my father no occasion to vse me worse then the rest, and therefore if he should doe it, I should haue iuste cause to complayne of him while I liued.


Annib.
You haue reason, if he vse you yll, mary not though he loue you lesse then he doth some other: for inequalitie of loue is permitted to the father, but not yll vsage.


Guaz.
How meane you that?


Annib.
A father that is a merchant, hath one sonne that is a scholar, another a souldiour, and an other a merchaunt: of those three it is a great chaunce but he will loue the mer|chaunt best, for that he seeth him like to him selfe in life and manners: Where in his other sonnes are to beare with him, for that by nature we are ledde to like those thinges, which resemble vs most: mary if he shall not giue them as good alowance for their dyet, apparel, and other necessaries, as he doth to the merchant, they shall haue occasion to complayne of him as vniust.


Guaz.
O how hard a thing is it for the father, after that partiall passion is once entred into his hart, to minister ius|tice indifferently?


Annib.
The greater is the wisdome of the father, who preferring the merites of his children before his owne par|tiall

affection maketh his senses yeelde to reason, and shew|eth him in deedes alike towardes all: I will not denye, but that the father by his authoritie, ought to distribute his fa|uoures as he seeth good, to one more, to another lesse, accor|ding to the demeanor and doinges of his children: for as by gentle vsage, he incourageth a childe that is well giuen, to doe well, so by harde handling, hee may bring one that is vn|toward, to goodnesse: yea, if he haue any child which is quite past grace, without any hope of recouery, he may lawfullye, not only loue him lesse then the rest, but quite cast him out of his fauour: like as Aristippus did by a lewde sonne of his: and being reproued for it by a friende of his, who willed him to consider that his sonne was a collup of his own flesh, and came from his Loynes: he aunswered, That lice, and a great many superfluities come from a mans body,  yet be|ing il, they are to be cast away. But those fathers are gret|ly to be blamed, who with vniust partialitie, and without a|ny reasonable consideration, vse one childe as legitimate, and the other as a Bastard: whereof it followeth, that he which is so coursely accounted of, doth not only fayle in affection towardes his father, but beginneth to fall to secrete warre with his other brother: whereby the father, whose chiefe of|fice is to establish quiet and concorde amongest his children, shall by his vndiscrete and vniust partialitie, plante amongst them a roote of continuall discorde. * And therefore the Fa|ther ought to be well aduised, how he preferreth in good wil one childe before another, and not to doe it vpon euery light occasion: As there are some which will doe it, not for anye fault which is in them, but for some naturall defect: where|in in my iudgement they do much amisse, in making their in|nocent childe beare the punishment of their own imperfecti|ons, who at the time they did beget him, were no doubt pos|sest with some infyrmitie of minde or body. *


Guaz.
I cannot abide the foly of some fathers, who make some one of their children their darling and minion, without seing any towardnesse in him in the world: being not asha|med to let euery man know their fond and causelesse doting.



Annib.
The Ape whiche had two yong ones at a litter, whereof shee loued the one, and cared nothing for the other, was vpon occasion driuen to flie from her denne, and hauing taken that which she loued in her armes, and tied the other at her back, in running, she stumbled agaynst somewhat which made her fall, and agaynste the harde grounde to kill her young one whiche shee hadde in her armes and loued so well, but the other whiche was at her backe, hadde no harme at all: whereby a man may see, that the Father oft tymes doth pennance for his doting and fonde offence, for that for the moste parte those children which are moste made of, fall out the worste: Yea, it often falleth out, that the chil|dren of the right side, by reason of their wanton and delicate bringing vp, proue doltes, fooles, and simple sots, whereas contrariwise, those which come in at the backe doore, beeing banished from their fathers house, and driuen to shifte for themselues, doe often times by their owne industrye and trauayle, auaunce themselues to suche estate, that they are in better case then their father and their lawfull brothers, to whom ofte tymes they afoorde ayde and succour in their distresses.


Guaz.
Wee may boldlye say then, that the iniustice of the father, breedeth disagreement betweene his children  him, howsoeuer that vnequall loue doth, which I proposed.


Annib.
Yea hardly, but for that wee made mention of a merchaunt, the father of Doctors  scholers, thervpon there commeth in my head an other occasion, which breedeth iars betweene the father and the child, which is, when the father is inferiour in calling to the sonne: as for example, if y^e father be an ignorant man, or a plaine fellow of the countrey,  the sonne be learned, or a braue courtier, you shal find great dif|ficultie to make these two agree together, for the father, ac|cording to his nature, and his calling, giueth his minde to base and vile things,  either knoweth not, or, esteemeth not y^e highe degree of his sonne: And though he speake nothing of it, yet hee is ill pleased in his minde, to see his sonne keepe his Grauitie conuenient for his estate, and to be so sumptu|ous

in his Diet and apparell, and hadde rather he woulde conuerte his gayne into Landes, Cattell, or some other commodity. There are other some, who are not so foolish, but they knowe the worthinesse of their Children, and what belongeth to their estate, yet for that they are infery|oure to them, they are greeued in their harts at it, so that they labour alwayes to withstande both in word  deed their preferment. On the other side, you shal see the sonne, eyther for that he seeth his father not to account of him as others doe, or for that he seeth him leade a filthy life, being neuer de|sirous to come out of the myre, withdraweth his affection from him, and woulde not by his will haue him come at anye time into his sighte, for that hee thinketh he doeth dishonour him, and if hee bee not so wicked to wishe his death, yet at leaste hee is well apayde, when he seeth him for some sicknesse or infirmitie layd vp in some bye corner of the house.


Guaz.
To this purpose I hearde talke the other daye of a wretch, so miserable, that he would neuer agree y^t his sonne, being a Doctor, should keepe a man to wayte vpon him, so that hee was fayne (when hee wente abrode) to retayne a poore man that dwelt by, to follow him in steede of a man: and one morning staying for his man at the gate, to wayte on him to Masse, and being very late, the father bethinking himselfe of his owne miserablenesse, and seeing how hard|lye his some was bestead, put on his Cloake, and sayde vn|to him, Goe your waye to masse, and I will followe you: thinking that his sonne was suche a foole to accepte his offer, and to shewe himselfe abroade in such shamefull forte.


Annib.
I thinke he offered to wayte vpon his sonne, rather for that he would not giue his poore neighbour his dinner, then for any shame he had of his owne misery, or respect of his sonnes honesty.


Guaz.
Now we are fallen vpon this Example, I woulde gladly know of you, in this difference of degree and calling, which ought to go formost, of the father or the sonne?



Annib.
This doubt hath been alredy decided by Taurus the Philosopher, who being visited by a Romane President, and by the Father of the sayd President, and being only one chaire set, while they were bringing another, he desired the Father to sit him downe: who answered, that his sonne ought to sit first, for that he was President: but for al y^t, he requested him still to sit downe, and that he woulde afterwarde shewe which of the two ought to haue the vpper hand. The Father being set, and afterwardes the sonne, he gaue this sentence: That in publique places and affayres, the father being a priuate person, ought to giue place to the sonne, who is ap|poynted in office, as he who presenteth the maiestye of the Prince, or common wealth: but otherwise in priuate pla|ces, and at the assembly and meeting of friends, the publique authoritie must giue place to the fatherly iurisdiction,


Guaz.
By vertue of this sentence, the father to the Doc|tour of whom we spake, should that morning, going to masse, haue made his sonne follow him in his long gowne, for that as then he was not in any office, but only a Doctor: whiche would haue been a goodly sight, and haue made euerye one laugh at it, albeit it had been but reason.


Annib.
If this were to be laughed at, the example of Sem|pronius Gracchus, Consull of Rome, was to be marueyled at: who to keepe his state in publique, meeting on Horse|backe his Father Q. Fab. Maximus, the Proconsull, com|maunded his Sergeauntes to goe againste him, and cause him to alight: which he did quickly, liking the better of his sonne, for that he knewe so well to maintaine the maiestie of the Romane Empyre. But to returne to our matter: there is one occasion yet remaining of the disagreement betweene the Father and the childe, whiche is, when the Father will neuer suffer his children to come foorth of their infancy.


Guaz.
How vnderstande you that?


Annib.
Mary when eyther thorow the authoritie of olde age, or thorow ambition, or couetousnesse, or too good opini|on in his own sufficiencie, the father is so desirous of keping his paternall iurisdiction, that though his children bee ari|ued

to mans estate, and be perfectly accomplished euery way yet he will alowe them neither more liuing, nor more liber|ty then they had when they were children.


Guaz.
I thinke they haue iust cause to bee mal contents, who knowing themselues to be sufficient me~, and to be so ta|ken of euery man are neuerthelesse vsed by their father like children: and therefore I cannot blame them greatly, if in stead of louing him, they complaine of death for delaying the execution of that iudgement, which so long before was pro|nounced agaynst him: To which purpose, I know a gentle|man, who hath liued this fourty yeeres, vnder a most rich father, who is so miserable, that he maketh him dispaire, and to say often to his companions that hee is a foole to liue so long, and that it is now high time for him to goe to another world: adding, that his liuing will do him no good when it falleth into his handes, for that, by course of nature, he shall be constrained to forgoe it againe.


Annib.
A certayne countrey fellowe vsed to say, that he gat by his labour euery day fiue loaues of bread: and be|ing asked how he distributed the~, answered in this sort, One I keepe for my selfe, another I throw away, another I pay home, and the other two I lend foorth: being requested to expounde his riddle, he sayd, I take one for my selfe, I call away another, in giuing it to my stepmother, I restore home one to my father, and two I lend to my childre~. By this ex|ample, more noble then rustike, both children ought to learn to be louing and gratefull to their father, and fathers to be liberall to their children, remembring, that in their age and necessity, that which they haue lent vnto their children, shall be restored by their children: wherto the fathers, we but now spake of, haue had no regard: and a man may well say, that they are doating old, that they are become children agayn, and quite voyd of iudgement.


Guaz.
If y^t come by the fault of age, I will not say that such men were wel worthy to dwell amongest the Caspians, who when the father is arriued to the age of threescore and ten, kill him presently and giue him to beastes to eat: but I

wyll say, that they ought to acknowledge their insuffi|ciency and want of iudgement, and to referre the ordering of their house and liuing to their chyldren, who are of discretion to deale in suche waighty matters. If couetous|nesse bee the cause of it, they ought to consider that it is a shamefull thing in olde folke, of all others: for there is nothing more absurde, or without reason, then for a man to make greate prouision for his iourney, when hee is almoste at hys iourneyes ende: so that if they haue heaped vp their wealth for themselues, why a little of it will serue their turnes, but if they haue trauayled for their children, it is meets they shoulde lette them haue it, so soone as they are of dyscretion to knowe how to vse it. If the  growe of ambition, the poore soules oughte to take a patterne, by Princes  rulers, who seeing their children fit to gouerne the peo|ple, gladly resigne vnto them their estates, realmes and Empyres: whereof wee haue manye examples. If they presume too muche of themselues, let them learne to knowe, that chyldren now adayes are borne wyse. And as menne lyue not so long in these dayes, as they did in tymes past, so they grow to perfection sooner now then they did heretofore.


Annib.
It is harde for these olde folke, to take ny profite by these good admonitions, for that their vyces by length of tyme, haue taken too deepe roote in them to bee pulled vp: yet we will not cease to aduise the fa|ther (if hee render the well doing and aduauncemente of his childe) to allowe hym wyth discretion some libertye in matters of the house, suffering him somtime to in|uite, to welcome, and make his companions good cheeres to giue intertainment to strangers, and as occasion shall serue, to vse the goodes of the house to serue his turne: but aboue all thinges he must both by example  by admonition, keepe from entring into his hart,  vnsatiable couetousnes; which maketh men wicked and vniust, or at least neuer suf|fereth the~ to liue in est  quiet,  especially y^e father whiche

is a gentleman, who ought to haue in his minde that king, who comming into his sonnes lodgeing, and seing there many peeces of plate, whiche hee before had giuen him, sayd vnto him, I see well thou hast no princely minde with thee, seing of so many thinges which I gaue thee, thou hast yet made thee neuer a freind: so that the father ought to stirre vp his sonne to liberall and gentlemanly deedes: mary yet so that now and then (if he bee not otherwise affayred) hee learne to play the good husbande, and see to thinges about home: whereby he shall be able to conserue and augment his estate, and keepe himselfe from falling into decaye: hereof will rise at the least three good effectes. The first is the loue of the sonne, who seing his father withdrawe hym selfe by little and little, from the gouernment of the house, to the intent to put him in his roome, receiueth thereby won|derfull contentment, thinketh himselfe in his minde much bound vnto him, and not only honoureth him, but wisheth him long to liue on earth. The second, is the commodity of the sonne, who by this meanes after his fathers death, shall haue no neede to seeke counsayle and ayd at his freindes and kynsfolkes handes, nor to put himselfe to the discretion of his seruantes, for the ordering of his house, hauing by the goodnesse and foresight of his father, all thinges long before in his owne hands: so that the gouermnent of his house, shal not to be straunge or troublesome vnto him, as it is to many when they haue lost their father. The third, is the sweet rest and contentment, which the father inioieth in his old yeeres, both for y^t he feeleth himselfe rid of all incombrance  vexa|tion, and besides seeth his sonne by his example gouerne his house orderly. For my part I count it the greatest felicity in the world, for a man to haue about him a number of goodly children, whiche are growne to perfection, whom hee may well terme the lyght of his eyes * and the staffe of his age: * and I marueile nothing, that the most prudent dame Cor|nelia shewed to her neighbour, that asked for her chaines  iewels, her learned and vertuous children: and methinkes it must needes be a greater comfort to y^e father, to see a proofe

of his childe, and how discreetly he can dispose of his liuing, and order his househould, then to doe it himselfe: now when the father shall be arriued to the Hauen of such happinesse, and consolation, methinkes he may ioyfully looke for the last houre of his life, and dye most contentedly.


Guaz.
It is (no question) far better to make place for their children of their owne accord, then to stay till they must needes do it, spite of their teeth. Like as Ptolomei did, who gaue y^e Realme of Aegipt to his sonne, saying, that a Realme was nothing so honourable nor acceptable a thing, as to bee the father of a King: whiche thing also aboue all his other actes increased the immortall glory of Charles the fift.


Annib.
Albeit in holy Scripture it be written, Giue no authority ouer thee, neither to thy sonne, neither to a woma~, nor to a brother, nor a friend, and, giue not away thy liuing to another while thou art aliue, least thou afterwardes repent it: yet there haue been in time past, and are at this day, many wise fathers, which depart both with authori|tye and liuing to their children, and yet incurre no inconue|nience by it, mary they doe it in suche sorte, that they ney|ther bring themselues into subiection to them, nor into suche case, that they are not able to lyue without them. * For the inheritance belonging by right vnto the childe, when he shall see the father keepe it wholy to himself, he doth not only desire to obtaine it, but seeketh to recouer it (as it were) as his due. And when he is driuen to stay for it vntill his father be dead, he maketh his account he hath it at death his hand, not at his fathers hand,  neuer thanketh him for it.


Guaz.
All the occasions which you haue hytherto reher|sed, of the disagreeme~t betweene the father and the children, arise of the fault of the father: now it were well we shoulde see what occasions come by the childes fault.


Annib.
When the father shall deale in such sort, that on his part none of those occasions we haue spoken of bee gi|uen, I thinke the child shall haue no cause to be at variance with him: and this saying shal haue place, that y^e sonne for the most part is like vnto the father:  this other also, that the

daughter commonly followeth the steppes of the mother: but for that there are some children which are vntoward inough without any fault of the father, I thinke good that we briefly set downe to the childe, a fourme of conuersation with his father, so that on his part there may be no occasion of disorder or disagreement giuen.


Guaz.
Though by the discourse already made, I haue partly learned, how the father ought to behaue himself towards the childe: yet I would gladly haue you briefly gather together the cheife points belonging to the father,  after to discend to the duties of the childe, as you haue now made offer to doe.


Annib.
I wil do so:  first I giue the father to vnderstand, that there is nothing in this worlde wherein there ought more care and diligence to be bestowed, then in the nurture and education of children, for thereof proceedeth for the most part, the maintenance or the decay of houses: That he begin betime to furnish their tender mindes with the feare and knowledge of God, of iustice, and truth, and with vertue,  good conditions, in such sort, that they learne to liue as if they were stil at the point to dye: That he indeuour to keepe them in obedience, rather by loue, then by feare, and to cause them to do well, rather of their owne accord, then by others inforcement, for it is vnseemely for one that is free, to liue in bondage, neither is feare any good keeper of vertue: That in teaching them, he rather dally with them, then terrifie them, for no art or dysciplyne stycketh in the mynde firmely, whiche is driuen into it forcibly: That howe forwarde soeuer they be, yet, that he cease not to incourage and pricke them forwarde, knowing that there is no horse but needeth the spurre: That he suffer them not to be idle, but to inure them to labour, whereby they may be able to indure labour, as Milo was able to carry a bull, bicause he vsed to carry hym a calfe: That he enter not into rages with his children, for a good father vseth wisdome in steade of anger, and awardeth a smal punishment, to a great fault, and yet is not so foolishe pitifull altogether to pardon it: knowing that as by sparing the rod he may seeme to hate his

childe, so by wearing it the much, he may abate his cou|rage, and make him dull and desperate: That hee prouide them of good maysters, and gouernoures, continually to at|tend them, for young children must be propped vp like yong trees, least the tempest of vices either breake them, or bowe them crooked: That hee suffer them not in any wyse to haunt the company of seruantes and of the base sort, of whom they will get suche corrupt speeches and naughty conditiones, as they will neuer after forget: That he bee carefull to marke in their childehood to what kynde of life they are naturally inclined, that he may diligently sette them to it, for an vntoward beginning, hath euer an vnlucky ending: That he teach the~ to gouern the~selues w^t the bri|dle  the spur, y^t is, with shame in dishonest thinges, and de|sire of glory in good thinges: That without iust occasion he vse no partialitie amongst his children, vnles he be willing to set them together by the eares: That in all his doings he shew himselfe graue and modest, and by doing well himselfe, giue his children an example to do the like, remembring how shamefull a thing it is, that he should be defiled with vyce, of whom others should take example of vertue: That in his old age, when his sonnes are men growne, through couetousnes he withhold not from them reasonable stipends to liue by, but deale so with them, that they may thinke they inioye their patrimony, no lesse in his life time, then if he were dead, otherwise in stead of honouring him, they wil wish him bu|ried: Finally, that he be so carefull ouer his children, that at his death, he feele not his conscience charged, in hauing to make accounte for his negligence in their behalfe: perswa|ding himselfe, that amongest all the abuses of the world (resited by an excellent authour in this sort, A wise manne without workes, an old man without religion, a yong man without obedience, a rich man without charity, a woman without honesty, a maister without vertue, a Christian con|tentious, a poore man proud, a King vniust) there is none worse then a negligent father. And therefore being moue by nature, pricked in conscience, and bound in honour and

honesty to cast a care for his children, let hym not in  wise cast of that care, but follow the example of good Aeneas, His sonne Ascanius was his only care.


Guaz.
I pray you now that for your greater ease, you wil likewise breifely comprehend the duty of the child.


Annib.
If the childe consider wel the great and extreame loue of the father towardes him, there shoulde neede no fourme of conuersation to be prescribed vnto him, for that consideration would containe him in his duty, and make him conforme himselfe to the will and pleasure of his father, in all thinges. I could bring many examples of pittifull fa|thers, who vpon some mishap befalle~ to their children haue shewed their excessiue loue, eyther by voluntary death, or by some other dolorous effect but let vs here only consider the greife of Kyng Dauid, who at the death of his sonne Absolon, was vanquished of his affections (whiche in all other accidentes he vsed to maister) that shedding teares aboundantly by the greife which he felt, he was driuen to breake out into these complaintes: My sonne Absolon, Ab|solon my sonne, who wil giue me leaue to dy for thee. Thus sorowfull was he for the death of his sonne, notwithstanding this his sonne had before slaine his other sonne Amon, and had done hym a thousand outrages, yea  finally conspired against him and his Realme: but for y^e children haue no such regard to this tender loue of their parents, as they ought to haue, doing as you would haue me, I say briefly that they ought to know that the first law of nature, is to honour the father  the mother:  that the Spartanes vsed to do reuere~ce to their elders, to the ende y^t being accustomed to reuerence those, whom they had nothing to do withal, they might haue their parents in the more honour  reuere~ce. If the Panims obserued y^e law so inuiolably, much more ought Christians to keepe it, who haue receiued it out of Gods owne mouth: who giueth his blessing,  promiseth the reward of long life to those y^t honour their father  mother, that no child should be so graceles  grateles, amo~gste infinit other, to forget these three  receiued of y^e father, to wit, his being, his nou|rishing,

and his instructing: for euery one of those is suffici|ent to perswade them, that next vnto God, there is nothing more to bee honoured then the Father and mother. If the father bee churlish and curst vnto them, let the manifold be|nefites receyued of him, counteruayle that crueltye, and continue them in their duetye, by the example of the young man, who, as one cast in his teeth that his Father spake ill of him, aunswered, That he would not do it, if he had not cause: Lette them take heede of molesting their pa|rentes any waye, or contending with them, but to ouercome them with patience, for they shall be sure neuer to fynde su|rer friende then their father, and they must alwayes carry in their mindes, that he which stubbornly striueth with his fa|ther, prouoketh the wrath of God against him, so y^t hee shall neither passe away his life quietly, nor yet make his end ho|nestly: let them so behaue themselues, y^t their father haue no cause to curse them,  wish ill of them, as Oedipus did to his Children, for it is a thing most certayne, that God heareth the prayers of the Father against his children: let them not think by any deede or seruice, to be able to require their Fa|thers goodnesse towards them, neither feare to be found flat|terers, for any praise they can giue him or for any kindnesse they can shew him, for when they haue done their duetye, to the vttermost they can yet shall they not haue done al which they should Lastly let them stick to their parentes, in all troubles and aduersitye, assuring the~selues, that they which shall abandon their parentes, shall be forsaken of God,  that is the greatest offence that may be committed.


Guaz.
A man may gather by your most godly admonitio~s, that y^e wise Salomon was not to be found fault withal, who being demaunded why he made no law against murtherers of their parentes, answered: That he thought no man (how wicked so euer he were) would ouer commit any suche mon|strous impiety. Haue you any more to say, touching the con|uersation betweene the Father and the sonne?


Annib.
Nothing else, but that he shall haue the same mea|sure made him by his children, as he shall meate to his Fa|ther:

like as there was a Father, who was driuen out of his owne house by his sonne, and was fayne to take vp his lodging in the spittle house, and seeing his sonne one day go by the doore, prayed him, for charitie sake, at leaste, to sende him a payre of sheetes to lye in. The sonne, mooued with his Fathers request, was no sooner come home, but he co~maun|ded one of his sonnes to carry a payre of sheetes to the Hos|pitall to his Grandfather: but the childe deliuered but one of them, which his Father blaming him for at his returne, he aunswered, I will keepe the other for you, when in your olde age you shall go to the Hospitall, as my Graundfather now doth. Whereby we maye learne that our Children will deale with vs, as we deale with our parents. And this shall serue to cloase vp our discourse, touching this conuersation.


Guaz.
I shall thinke your discourse more perfect, if it shal please you to make some perticuler mention of Daughters: for that the father is to vse himself otherwise towards them, then toward his sonnes.


Annib.
I feare me, I cannot satisfie you in that point, for that at this day, the manner of bringing them vp, is so diffe|rent, I say not of one countrey fro~ another, but of one Coun|tye, yea, and of one Citie, that a man canne set downe no cer|taine determinate rule of it: for some fathers will not suffer their Daughters to set their foote foorth of doores, not past once or twise in the yeere, at some solemne feasts: some will allow them, not only to keepe company with their friendes and kinsfolke at home in the house, but also to visite their friendes abrode, and to be present at banquets  meeting of friends: some will haue them taught to write and reade, and to haue skill in Poetry, musicke, and painting: others will haue them learne nothing but to spinne with the disaffe, and gouerne the house: do you now thinke it possible to set down one law which shall be agreeable to all these diuersities.


Guaz.
I remember I haue read of a good wise Paynter, who hauing to draw the singuler bewties of Hellene, assem|bled together a company of the fayrest women he coulde get, and taking of euery one of them y^t parte which was most ex|cellent

in them, he reduced al those bewties into the shape of Hellen, so I would haue you if euerye one of those fashions by you rehearsed, like you not of it selfe, by the pensil of your iudgement to draw foorth those partes out of euery of those customes, whiche like you best, and thereof to compose the fourme and manners of a perfect virgine.


Annib.
I had rather you would perswade me to flie, ra|ther then follow the example of the painter, for whereas hee drew Helene, I thinke I should doe better to represent Lu|crece or Virginia.


Guaz.
You haue taken me at a vauntage, but I woulde haue you aunswere me, according to the simple meaning of my wordes.


Annib.
Though I doe so, I must not follow the painter, for that his painting tended only to one ende, but Fathers doe not so in the bringing vp of their Daughters: and yet perchaunce euery one of those diuersittes is commendable, if it be well vnderstoode.


Guaz.
I see not how those extremities can be commenda|ble: for not to suffer a mayde to go abrode but once or twise in the yeare, and to keepe her inclosed like a holy relique, is the way to make her become foolish, fearefull, and oute of countenaunce in company, and more easie to bee caughte in a net: for being not accustomed to see the sunne, so soone as she sets her foote forth of the house, her eyes dazell with the least beams therof, and down she falleth backward. Now the other, which goeth abrode euery day with her mother, and haunteth feasts and banquets, melteth away like wax in the fyre: and driuing by little and little, the maidenly modestye out of her lookes  gestures, there appeareth in her licenti|ous and lasciuious behauiour, so that she is take~ rather for a mother, then a maid:  if there come no worse of it, y^e mother ought to assure her self of this at least, that as some folk pres|sed by pouerty and neede, bring into the publique place the moueable goods of their house, and sel the~ for lesse then they are worth, so the mother bringing her daughter so oft abrode into publique places, maketh her therby lesse prised,  worse

bestowed, the~ otherwise she might be. I say nothing of those which are taught in their cha~bers, to read, to sing,  to make verses,  wil neuer come down into y^e kitchin, but I wil leaue that charge to the poore husbands, whose house goeth to de|cay,  oft times honour too,  al for hauing so learned a wife: Then if you cast your eyes vpon one of those whiche can doe nothing but spin and sow, you shal see in attire, in talk, in be|hauiour, y^e very figure of a milkmaid of y^e countrey, who will haue as good a grace amongest other women, as a Satyre would haue amongst y^e Nymphes. Wherfore I should think it good, that out of euery one you should take the best part,  make therof one perfect one, according to your fancy.


Annib.
I will do it in few words: replying vnto you, y^t all those different maners are co~mendable, when they tend to a co~mendable end. It behoueth then, discreet fathers, who are to bestow their daughters, to measure first their degree, and disposition, and then to dispose of them accordingly: And if they thinke them fit to enter into religion, the mother, who ought to haue cheefe charge of them, must seeke to wayne them from al worldly vanities,  to inure them to such since|ritie of thoughts, and purity of life, that the vow which they shall make aboue the possibility of nature, and contrarye to the liberty allowed to mankinde, may not be so broken as it is daylye, and that that estate maye not bee polluted with whoredome and other fylthinesse, as it hath been by Rhea, that Romane vestall virgine, and diuers other Romish vota|ries, synce her time. If they meane to bestowe them in Ma|riage, the father must consider of what calling, and of what countrey his sonne in law is like to bee, and so to frame his daughter accordingly: As if he purpose to marry her into a countrey where the wiues are inioyned to a strict life, and mued vp by their husbandes like haukes, for feare least they should stoupe at some pray which they should not, then it be|houeth the father to abridge her of liberty, to kepe her with|in dores,  to accustome her to such a hard  solitary life, y^t it may not seeme strange or greeuous vnto her, whe~ her hus|bande shall bynde her to the like. Contrary, if she bee to bee

married into a more free countrey, such as Piemont is, or our Montferrat, the father must somewhat slake the bridle hand, and giue her more liberty, y^t she may be fit for that life which the wiues there leade, and not taken for a foole and a clowne.


Guaz.
The father hath not alwayes his sonne in lawe in his sleeue, mariages (as they say) are made in heauen, and are guided by destiny: so that the father may bee tenne yeeres in bruyng a matter, whiche in a moment he may bee driuen to chaunge.


Annib.
You haue preuented me, I thought to haue sayd as much: And therefore I thinke that the father being in no certaynetye for the marriage, ought in this doubt to carry a heauy hand, rather than a light, on the bridle: For it is much more easy to let loose the raines after|warde, than to take them vp, being once fallen on the necke.


Guaz.
Seing you are fallen vppon this poynte of restrayning of liberty, I cannot be restrayned from speaking of the abuse of this Cytie, where a manne shall see nothing else all the day long, but women in the streetes, which go from house to house, visityng some of courtesie, and other some (who before haue vysited them) of duty, though without occasion: not by reason of some mariage, or of some freindes death, but (as I haue heard) if some one haue had but a fit of an ague, or haue kept her chamber for a few dayes, all the women in the towne runne thyther of a ranke, as it were in pro|cession.


Annib.
The chaunces of these visitations in deed are so often, and so many, that they spend six dayes of the weeke in them: in so much, that you shall heare some of them com|playne that they haue scarce leysure on the saterday, to washe their head: but I will say thus muche, that they are worthy of excuse, yea, and of prayse, if they do it of charity, and not of purpose to shew themselues in their brauery, and to iet vp and downe from this place

to that, to make report and ieastes of the faults of other hou|ses: it is most certayne that the Gentlewomen of Mantua which are in this citie, mocking, or at least maruayling at that fashion, yet because they will not seeme to be il brought vp, they doe nothing but runne and trot vp and downe, fra|ming themselues to the vsage of our Countrey women.


Guaz.
If that custome were to be allowed, it were good also, for the vniuersal benefit, to bring in another custome, that while the wyues go gossipping aboute, the husbandes should keepe home to sow and spin, and to see to other things about the house, in their absence.


Annib.
I thinke good that we let the wiues walke abrode at their pleasure, and that we goe home to the daughters: whom it is needefull to instruct in thinges meete to gette the fauoure of their Mistresse, if the father meane to set them to the court to the seruice of some Princesse, so that it beho|ueth them to learne to reade, to write, to discourse, to sing, to play on Instruments, to daunce, and to be able to perfourme all that which belongeth to a Courtier to doe: As that Ve|netian Lady coulde, who was commended, for that she knew how to vse in steede of wool a booke, in steede of a spindle, a penne, in steede of sowing, inditing, thinges whiche happen at this daye to few women, and yet were common to manye in times past: for I am sure, I haue seene the role of more then a thousande, who haue been excellently seene in Diui|nitie, in Philosophy, in Phisick, in Musick, in painting, and in all Sciences.


Guaz.
I sawe about the Frenche Queene certayn meane Gentlewomen, enter into such credit, onely by some one of those good partes by you rehearsed, that they are now come to be maryed to the cheefe Gentlemen in Fraunce, without any peny giuen them in dowrye by their father: but a pri|uate Gentleman hath no neede in his house of singing or daunsing.


Annib.
You say well, and therefore if the Father bee not like to bestowe his daughter  some man of great calling, hee ought to practise her rather in spinning on the wheele,

then in playing on instruments.


Guaz.
And how thinke you of the daughters not onlye of Gentlemen, but of Merchants and artificers, which learn to write and reade?


Annib.
Seing these things are at the least commodious, if they be not altogether necessary, I do not mislike them, so that they be well imployed.


Guaz.
I would thinke you had reason, if the women of Ita|ly did follow sutes in law, and frequented the houses of Iud|ges and Aduocates, to make them priuye to their case, or in Merchandise kept the bookes of account, as diuerse women in Fraunce doe: but in teaching our women to write and reade, we doe but giue them occasion to turne ouer the hun|dred Nouelles of Boccace, and to write amorous and lasci|uious letters.


Annib.
We giue them also occasion to reade the liues of Saints, to keepe the accountes of the house, . to write their minds to their absent husbands, without disclosing their se|cretes to anye Secretary: besydes, you maye assure your selfe, that those women whiche cannot write, nor make loue by Letters, will doe it, if they bee disposed, by wordes, yea, and if their tongue shoulde fayle them, they woulde fall to it by signes: but to ende this matter, I conclude touching Daughters, that in such diuersities as are vsed at this day in their education, I canne giue no fitter aduer|tisemente then this, that the Fathers bestow all their stu|dye and industrye to bring them vp chaste, as well in bodye as in mynde, for a man wayeth it not much to haue the flesh vnspotted, if the thought bee defyled: And therefore it is needefull to put into their hartes Godlye imaginations, that from their inwarde puritye, there may shine outward|lye in their face and countenaunce, the brighte beames of modestye. And for that bewtye is a frayle and daungerous thing, those whiche are bewtifull haue so muche the more neede of that vertue, to keepe their bewtye vnblemished, for bewtye in an vnchaste woman, serueth to no more purpose, then a Golde Ring in a Swines, Snoute, and

to make it shorte, they muste vnderstande that as the Poet sayth:
A woman voyd of honesty, can make no brags of bewty.


Guaz.
Before you passe to the conuersation betweene Brothers, I woulde gladlye haue you sette downe the dif|ference which ought to be betweene sonnes and Daughters in conuersation.


Annib.
I know not whether in tossing ouer your bookes, you haue lighte vppon that place where Cicero giueth a nippe to his Daughter and his sonne in Lawe, both at once.


Guaz.
I doe not know that I haue read it, and if I haue, I haue forgotten it.


Annib.
His sonne in law was so delicate of nature, that in his gate he vsed a slowe and mincing pace, like a woman: his Daughter on the other syde, iryd out lustilye like a man, whiche her Father seeing, fayde merrilye vnto her, Daughter, goe as your Husbande doth: which is to be vn|derstoode, not only of going, but of all other doinges, where|in it is an vndecent thing for a woman to resemble a man, or a man a woman. And therefore a Mayde oughte to frame er behauyour in such sorte, that aboue all thinges shee shewe both inwardlye and outwardly, that maydenlye mo|destye which is proper to maydes: for it is a monstrous and naughtye thing, to see a young Gyrle vse suche libertye and boldenesse in her Gesture, lookes, and talke, as is pro|per to men: and therefore lette maydes learne in all their behauioure to expresse that modesty, which is so seemely for their estate, assuring themselues, that though they be furni|shed with al other bewties, graces, and vertues of the world, yet if that bright sun shine not in the~. all the other as starres borrowing light of that, will make no shewe at all. And as Goldesmiths sometime couer their ware and iewels with a Glasse, to make them shewe the better, so a mayde vnder the vayle of modesty, ought to incloase all her other perfec|tions, to increase the brightnesse of them, and the more for|cibly to drawe the eyes and the hartes of others, to haue her

in admiration. On the other side, it is the worst sighte that may bee, to see sonnes, who by their womanly gestures and countenaunce, make men doubt whether they are males or Females: which maketh mee returne to say, that the father vnderstandeth it ill, who with too greate rigour maketh his sonne as fearefull as a Cony: whereby, comming before his betters, he sheweth that he hath no tongue in his mouth, or else he speaketh and aunswereth so foolishly, that he maketh himselfe to be laughed at: by reason whereof, hee will not willingly come in any company, but hideth himselfe, and ac|cording to the saying of the Poet:
In thickets he him shrowds, as deere pursued with hou~ds.


Guaz.
In my iudgement, the Frenche men in that poynt vse great discretion: who in their childrens infancye, begin to embolden them before their betters, and to make the~ talk with them: whereby they come to haue a good audacitie, and to be resolute in their behauiour: neyther are they any more abashed at the presence of the King himselfe, then of their equals.


Annib.
That boldnesse is not too be found in many Ita|lians, for I haue knowen of them many excellent and worthy men, who comming before princes, haue been so astonish, and so timerous, that their coolour hath chaunged, the  hath runne downe their face, their voice hath trembled, their body hath quiuered, and their wordes haue come out so foo|lishly, that they haue playnely shewed in what troublesome taking they haue been in: And though wise men like well of it, and take it for a token of a good nature, yea, and in respect therof beare them the greater affection, yet oftentimes such perturbations hinder a man much, and are mockt at, as vn|meete for men. And thereof we may gather the great wrong that fathers, mothers, and nurces, doe to yong children, whe~ they will make it a sport to put their children in feare with tales of Robin good fellow, and such like, whereby they of|fende God, and make their children fearefull and dastardlye. It behooueth vs therefore to make our children bolde, and to vse them at the beginning to withstande those things which

breed any such fearfulnesse in them: otherwise the prouerbe will be verified in them, That the wolfe is cruell to the gentle dogge: wherefore we ought to make them take ex|ample of the fox, who at the first sight of the Lion, was at his wits end for feare, but seeing him againe, he began to feare him but a little, and at length came before him very boldly. And therefore we will conclude, that boldnesse is good in all thinges, and that nothing is well done, which is doubtfully and fearefully done.


Guaz.
If it were euer time to set a good face on the mat|ter, and to bee audacious, it is no doubt now: for that this great respect and modesty in deedes, is thought fitter for men of the Church, then for courtiers: and though it be accepta|ble to those towardes whome it is vsed, yet (as you say) it is preiudiciall to those who shall vse it: whereas contrari|wyse he that is bold in company (so that it be with dyscreti|on) is more esteemed, and maketh himselfe place in all pla|ces, so y^t neither the preceptes of Cato, nor the rules of the Philosophers do now dayes stand vs in more steede then you say for.


Annib.
I will not say that they are to be contemned, but I say that in thinges pertayning to manners and behauiour (so long as they are not repugnant to honesty) we ought to frame our selues to the fashio~s of the countryes  tymes we liue in: making such answere to those obseruers of antiqui|ty, as was made to Politian: who meeting a frend of his go|ing a great pace in the streat, stayed him by the lap of his cloake, aduising him to go more softly: for that Aristotle sayth, A slow pace is a signe of grauity, who staying and loo|king him in the face, answered, I merueile of you, if Aristo|tle had had but halfe the businesse that I haue, hee woulde haue runne styll, and yet he would not haue dispatched the third part of them: we will say then to end this matter, that seeing neither men ought to be Sardanapales, nor wo|men Amazones, the charge of the father is, to see that in any wise, there be a difference in conuersation betweene the sonne  the daughter, he in audacity, and shee in modesty.



Guaz.
Now I thinke it not amisse, that you prescribe to widowes a fourme of conuersation.


Annib.
If wee shall bring wydowes into company, how shal they be wydowes? yet we wil propose vnto them, either y^t conuersatio~ of a second husband, or else a solitary life meete for widows,  if we shal say any thing touching this master, let vs content our selues to shew that y^e estate of widowes, is of all others most vnfortunate: for not only those whiche liue licentiously, but euen the wisest  the honestest of them, serue for a marke for ill tongues to shoote at,  it seemeth y^t y^e more they couer their face  their eyes with their maskes, the more busily men labour to discouer in them some fates. Wherefore if they will exempt themselues from such iniu|ries, they must take heed (the yong ones especially) eyther in talke, countenance, apparell, or behauiour, to giue the least suspition of vanity that may be: and if reasonable occasion inforceth them not, they ought not to come in any company, but to keepe them both in name  in deed honest: they ought aboue all thinges to banish idlenesse and ease, and to apply themselues continually to some commendable exercise, re|membring this saying, That a wyddowe lyuing in vo|luptuousnesse is dead, * and laying before them the exam|ple of the renowned widowe Iudith, whom thoughe her great riches, her young yeeres, and her singuler bewty, per|swaded to marry agayne: yet shee was content to preferre her wyddowhood before wedlocke, her wollen garments, before gorgeous apparell, abstinency before gluttony, wat|ching before sleeping, praying before loytring, and armed with these weapons, she cut of the head of Holofees, that is, the diuel *.


Guaz.
I looke now that according to the order of your deuision, you speake of the conuersation betweene brothers.


Annib.
You will then that I shall expres speake of that, which is necessarily inspyed  that whiche I haue already spoke~ for if y^e father vse such eat in the educatio~ of his chil|dren,  the children such diligence in folowing y^e instructions of the Father as we haue aduised them to doe, it is nt

possible but that the brothers should liue in vnity  amity, and gouerne themselues together in one minde and consent, and therefore we haue no need to speake much of it.


Guaz.
If you consider the sieldome agreement  the often contentions betweene brothers, you shall want us mat|ter to speake of, if you want no time to speake in.


Annib.
As it troubleth the Phisition most to finde out the cause of the disease, whiche once being found, hee soone findeth a medecine to cure it: so according to our custome we must first haue recourse to the occasions which breed this discord amongest brothers,  those once known, we shal qui|ly find a remedy for it.


Guaz.
It is needfull that wee seeke out the causes of it, for that the effects thereof are soo horrible  wonderfull For in my fancy, y^e rage between sauage beasts is not so great, as the hate and ancour between brothers liuing in dissention.


Annib.
For proofe of your opinion it is sayd, y^t the mity between Eeocles Polces was so great, y^t their bodyes beng burnt together, the flames were eene most miracu|lously to part one from another: shewing plainly, that death was not able to take vp their controuersies, or set an end to their  hatred.


Guaz.
I knew in Fraunce two brothers, Italians, of great valour and prowesse, both men at armes, and in pay with the King: who, vppon a very small occasion, fell out in such sort, that they not only left lying togeather in one lodgeing, as they had ane  y^e spare of tenne yeeres before, but also tal|king together, and saluting one another: yea their hatred did fester in their hartes in suche sorte, that if any vppon good will wente aboute to make them freinds, assoone dealing wyth one, assoone with another, hee got nothing by it, but theyr ill wyll. At that same tyme, the Count Hercules Srozze Ambassadour of Mantua, kept house at Paris, where to mayntayne hys degree, and of hys owne bountifull nature, he gaue entertainment to gentlmen of all countryes, but hee was most of all visited by Italian men at armes, of whom, a man shoulde see somtymes at his

tay to the number of tenne: so that he seemed to be thei Captayne. Thyther often resorted the one or the other of those brothers, wherevpon Easter day approching, this Erle thought in these dayes of penitence, he should be able to bring them to confesse theyr fault, to recon|cile themselues one to another, and to liue brotherly to|gether, and beginning to trie the mynde of the younger brother, in shewing hym, that hee ought to humble hym selfe to his elder brother, hee found hys hart so harde|ned, that hee would relent nothing at all. Afterwardes he addressed hymselfe to the other, and went about by ma|ny pleasant deuises to make him vnderstand, that it was his parte being elder and dyscreeter, to supplye the de|fault of his brother, which hee interpreted so wronglye, that he sayd to the Count, he vnderstood by the halfe word, what the whole men, and that he was content, to forbeare his house, to the end that those who were so far in his bokes, might haue free accesse vnto it. To be short all his affaultes were in vaine, as if they had been made against an inuincible fort: and the best co~position which he could bring him to, was that he was content in respect of him, to bee friendes with his brother, but he would afterwardes kyll him if he could: whiche hee failed to do, for that within few daies after, in that ill mynde he was in, he was slayne at the battayle at S. Quinten.


Annib.
He thought to shew the Count some curtese, in deferring the death of his brother so long. And trulye it is a desperate cure, to go about to quenche the fire of discord, when it is once kindled in the hartes of two Brothers: whyche maketh mee muche muse howe it shoulde bee so, being a thinge so farre from all reason.


Guaz.
But I thinke it rather a reasonable thing, that  man shoulde finde himselfe most greeued with him, whiche ought least to greeue him.


Annib.
And I thinke it reasonable, that a man shoulde be least offended with him, who ought to be most bolde with him.



Guaz.
Knowe you not that where is great loue, from thence proceedeth great hate?


Annib.
Know you not, that where is great loue, there ought also to be great patience?


Guaz.
You see yet by experience, effects contrary therto.


Annib.
Brothers are in deed oft times at discord, for that they were neuer at accord: but brothers which from their infancy haue liued in loue together, wil put vp any iniury or displeasure, rather then they wil fall out among themselues.


Guaz.
You meane then, that the cause why brothers fall out, is for lacke of loue.


Annib.
If I should set downe that, for y^t cause, I should be counted as very a foole as he, who being askt, why the dogge folowed his maister, answered, for y^t his maister went before:  you might say y^t, according to the prouerbe, I went about to fil your mouth, with an empty spoone: That is, to seeme to teach,  not to teach. Wherefore if you will haue me come to y^e right occasions of this discord, I say, I haue noted the two chiefe causes therof: the one, by y^e fault of the fathers, the o|ther, by y^e fault of the brothers. Touching y^e discord growing by the fathers fault, we haue spoke~ sufficiently of it already: For the other, it happeneth when brothers take more care for the partes, then for the whole body. I meane by the body, all the brothers together,  by the partes, eache one of them: for that brothers stand vs in the like stead as our eyes, hands,  feete do. Yea if we consider the matter thorowly, we shall finde that brothers are framed more fitly for the mutuall ayd one of another, then the partes of our bodye are: for one hande, can but helpe the other hand which is present, and one foote the other foote which is hard by it, but the mutuall aid of brothers stretcheth farther: for being far distant one from another, they cease not to succour  assist one another. If then brothers, according to their nature, were cheeflye addicted to the conuersation of this body, without casting their onlye care for their owne peculier parte, there is no doubt of their brotherly loue, and good agreement together.


Guaz.
Indeed that naughty passion of bearing our selues

to great affectio~, wil not suffer vs to loue others as we ought to do, though they be neuer so nere vnto vs.


Annib.
It is true: and that is the cause there are so few brothers, which will preferre the common honoure and pro|fite of them all, before theyr owne partyculer aduaunce|ment, and that we daily see thinges common, commonly neg|lected, whereof for the most part, groweth the decay of hou|ses: for by the diuision of goodes, the forces of brothers are weakened, and by the diuision of hartes, they come somtymes to receiue iniuries, which euery one by himselfe hath his handes full to repulse. Which that wise Kyng shew|ed manifestly, who by the bundell of roddes, gaue his chil|dren to vnderstande, howe inuyncible theyr force was, so long as they held together. Wherfore it is requisite, that a|boue all thinges, brothers lay before them the common ho|nour and profite, and that all of them both in deedes and in counsaile, bee carefull for the conseruation of the honoure of their house: and let no one of them perswade himselfe by his sufficiency to supply the defects of the other, and to carye away all the honour and credite from them.


Guaz.
Soft I pray you, so long as I shall liue vertuously  well, do you thinke my honour any thing impaired, though some of my brothers liue ill?


Annib.
Your particuler honour shall be nothing diminy|shed, but the common honour of your house shall, wherein you haue part.


Guaz.
And why? shall not my commendable behauiour, counteruaile their lewd demeanor?


Annib.
Howsoeuer it counteruaile it, it cannot wype away the dishonour, which your house sustaineth by it: which recei|ueth as much shame by their ill doing, as honor by your well doing. And therefore they are greatly to blame, which take not as greate care of theyr Brothers as of themselues: for the brothers being, as we haue sayd, members of one bo|dy, any one of them cannot be stayned, but the whole bodye will be spotted: and thervpon it is sayd, That the nose can|not bee cut without bloodying the mouth. This neerenesse

which ought to be between brothers, is likewise implyed in the name of brother, which in latine signifieth as it were a|nother, to giue vs to vnderstand, that a brother to a brother is as another hymselfe: whereof I cannot at thys tyme bryng a more playne example then of a worke, or booke, whereof there are prynted in one presse diuers volumes, whiche may perhaps dyffer in the couering and outward trymming, and yet are but one thyng, hauing one selfe beginning and ending: so that the faults which are in one of these volumes, are common to them al, whereof I inferre, that the faulte which is in one brother, is common to all the rest. Wherfore for y^e honour of their house, brothers ought to support one another, and when the one falleth, the other ought to helpe him vp again, or else to confesse that hee hym selfe is fallen to the ground: besides, it is an vnseemly thing for a man, to see himselfe raised to high degree, and looking towardes the ground, to behould his brother in lowe estate. And a man may bee bold to say, that he which hath no care of his brothers honour, hath no care of his owne. Of this com|mo~ honour, Scipio Africanus was very carefull, who hauing subdued Spaine, vanquished Annibal,  conquered Afrique, thought he had done nothing, if he might not see lykewise y^e honour and renown of his brother to increase: whereof hee was so iealous, that he not only procured that he was chosen by the people of Rome for y^e exploit of Asia, but spoyling himselfe of his owne authority, he was content to follow his brother as a man at armes,  as a priuate Souldyer,  hono|ring him openly as Captayne general, and counsayling him secretely as a brother, he wrought so with him, that pricked forward with the honour his brother did him, furthered by y^e aduise he gaue him,  incouraged by y^e example he before had showne him, he won to himself the name of Asiatique, to his immortal glory,  to the people of Romes singuler benefite.


Guaz.
That Asiatique might well say of Africane.
My father he was in honour, my sonne in loue, my bro|ther in yeeres.
And truly this was notable loue,  worthy eternall memory,

to the shame of those who are so farre from procuring the ho|nour and aduauncement of their brothers, that they reioyce at their misery and misfortune.


Annib.
I could rehearse vnto you many examples of such brothers, who through mallice  discord haue been so lead a|wry, y^e seking continually to disgrace one another, they haue shamed the~selues both: making some to laugh at the~,  some to pittie them. But it is a thing worthy commendation, and admiration, to see concorde and amitie surely established a|mongest brothers: so that none of the~ go about any thing for their owne priuate co~moditie, but by the consent of the rest, for the common honour and aduancement of their house: and so long as y^e bonde of brotherhood is kuit in such sort, it may wel be sayd that the sword which vndid Gordians knot, shal not be able to vndoo it. To be short, there is nothing which so much maintaineth the honour of houses, as the agreement a|mongst brothers:  here I must say, that those houses are far more happy and fortunate where there are many brothers a|greeing wel togither, then where there is but one only: for as no man hath y^e force of Atlas to beare vp heauen with his shoulders, so there is no burthe~ so heauy, which being sustai|ned by many, becommeth not light: besides, the natures, de|grees,  professions of brothers, being diuerse,  all of them referring al their care to the aduauncement of their house, they wil, like workemen about a building, diligently applye themselues to it, y^e one by learning, the other by armes, some by temporal or spiritual promotions, some by some profitable trade of life, or by some other meane: al which things cannot be in one man alone.


Guaz.
Now you haue shewed how necessary concord is a|mongst brothers, I would gladly haue you set downe some order of conuersation, whereby they maye keepe and mayn|taine themselues in concorde.


Annib.
The fourme of their conuersation dependeth first, of the prudency and authoritye of the Father, who oughte to labour to knit them fast in good wil together,  to admonish them to honour and ayd one another, when afterwards they

shal come to yeeres of discretion, it is their partes so long as they shal liue in common, to beware of appropriating to the~|selues any thing particulerly: for that besides the offence to Godward, y^e cracking of their credite, there is nothing y^t ma|keth their brothers so soone to fal out with the~, as that doth: Moreouer, it is their parts to obserue y^e order of nature, so y^t the yonger (if inequalitie in degree be not let) do honor to his elder brother: A custome introduced by the Romanes amongst friends, much more ought it to take place amongst brothers, but for al y^t, the elder brother is not quite discharged, for it is his part to reco~pence the humilitie of his yonger Brother, w^t such good will  liberalitie, that he may haue the better will to doe him honour. It belongeth also to the elder Brother, to haue more discretion with him, and to beare with his yonger Brother, when he shall chaunce to fayle in his duety toward him, letting hym to vnderstand his fault in a gentle sorte,  at conuenient tyme: so that his admonition may not be ill ta|ken, but be thoughte to proceede of good will, where|by his Brother shall beare him the greater affection: but aboue all other thinges, I thinke it needefull for the maynteynaunce of concorde betweene brothers liuing to|gether, that they bee not ouer bolde one with another, ey|ther in wordes or deedes: which oft times breedeth debate amongste them, but to vse suche modest respecte in their doings, that they giue no occasyon of myslyke any waye.


Guaz.
Of the one syde, this aduertisement liketh mee well, for that ouer broade speeche, and too homelye dealing withoute any respect, make sometymes so deepe a wounde, that the smarte of it beeing intollerable, they seeke the reuenge of it with theyr tongues, yea and sometymes with their handes: but on the other side I consider, that in vsing this respect which you spake of, the brothers will not dare to vse these reprehensions and admonitions amongst the~selues, which you haue proposed, for feare of offending one another: whereof shall followe rightly that which the Poet sayth:
He doth not well, who doth contende,
Nor hee who dares not reprehende.



Annib.
I am not of your mynde, but in my iudgement, it falleth out cleane contrary: for the reprehension whiche commeth from a foule mouthed person, hath no suche great force, and is imputed rather to his naughtye na|ture, then to any desire hee hath to amend his Brother: but the admonition which commeth from a discreet man, is wel take~,  the party which receiueth it, perswadeth himself it is vpon great cause, and of great good will that the other (being so wise  so honest) vseth it. But you must not think that in making mention of a modest respecte to bee vsed, I meante a distrustfull fearefulnesse, whiche maketh vs wee dare not freelye vtter the truth, as it is the fashyon towardes Princes, Magistrates, and other our Supe|riours: for that feare woulde quite quenche out the fyre of loue which is requisit amongst right brothers: but I meant that graue and discreete maner, whereby we doe honour to others, and cause others to doe honoure to vs: which letteth vs not to reprehende our friende, muche lesse our brother.


Guaz.
Yet I am of opinion, there are some brothers which forbeare to do it, for feare to offende one another, in the same respecte y^t seruants are afearde to speake to their maisters.


Annib.
Say rather, that want of good will keepeth them from doing it: whereof it commeth, that one brother seeketh not to amend the other, but taketh pleasure to backbyte one another.


Guaz.
Our reuerend brother Bernardin Maccia, reader of the Institutes, vsed to make mention thereof: recounting that he knew two brothers, the one a studient, y^e other a cour|tyer, who though they were counted honest men, yet because they were too talkatiue, the preciser sort could not awaye w^t their company, and as it was his chance one day to go visite the student who was not well at ease, entring into the house, he met the other brother comming forth, whome hee asked how the sick man did? who aunswered, reasonable well, but go I pray you  see him, I warrant you hee will weery you with his babling. Beeing entred the Chamber, after ma|ny wordes of comfort to the sick partie, he sayd vnto him, I

you not how your brother doth, for I saw him but now very merry as I came in hyther: whereto the sick man answered, Men hauing the world at wil, as he hath, are neuer but mer|ry, and if you stayed long with him, I beleeue he hath made you almost deafe with pratling.


Annib.
In truth if brothers woulde agree to tell one ano|ther of their faultes priuily, they should auoyde the mockes  scoffes of others openly: And for that it seemeth to me we haue spoken ynough of this matter, we wil conclude, that as one hande washeth another, and both of them the face, so one brother ought to support another, and all of them to procure the honour of their house: for the maynteinaunce whereof, there is required amongst them a concord, composed of loue, discretion, honorable respect, and friendly reprehension.


Guaz.
We are at point, as farre as I see, to make an ende of this dayes discourse, seing wee haue no more to speake of, but of the conuersation betweene the maister  the seruaunt: yet I am afearde least it be greeuous vnto you to spende the tyme here to your losse, which in other places you might be|stow to your gayne.


Annib.
I frequent other places to pleasure others,  there in deede I spend the time: but I am with you for myne own pleasure, and therefore here I get the time: wherefore let vs go forward cherefully, for if my seruant be no more greeued to attend me without, then I am to be here within, it is not possible to find a maister  seruant better content the~ we are,


Guaz.
I will answere for your man, that hee is contente where he is at this prese~t: for he is with our seruants, where they passe the time together in three things, which they take singuler pleasure in.


Annib.
Which be those?


Guaz.
In drinking, playing, and speaking ill.


Annib.
Those thinges cannot be done, but to the disprofite and dispraise of the maysters.


Guaz.
Though they shoulde want those three, yet I dare warrant you, your manne is contente, in that hee is oute of your sight.



Annib.
I beleeue it without an oth: but whereof thinke you proceedeth that discontentment of seruants?


Guaz.
Of the lacke of loue, for if they loued their maister, they would loue his presence,  would come to be continually in his sight.


Annib.
And whereof may we thinke that lacke of loue in seruantes proceedeth?


Guaz.
Perchance of the difference of life, of mindes, and of manners which is betweene them: what say you of it?


Annib.
I am of y^t opinion likewise, but the very seruitude it selfe may also be a cause of this lacke of loue (y^t I may not say hatred) of the seruantes towardes the maisters, for that menne serue commonly rather of necessitye, then of free will: for so muche as a manne knowing himselfe to bee borne free, when he putteth himselfe in seruice; he forceth his nature,  though voluntarilye hee maketh hymselfe a prisoner, yet it is not to bee sayde, that he is content with it, or that hee hateth not him whiche keepeth him in subiection. There is no doubt of it, but thoughe he haue with his mouth promised  sworne fidelitie to his Maister, yet neuerthelesse, in heart hee rebel|leth agaynste hys seruice: And therefore it is no meruaile though he flye hys presence, and like better to be his seruant a farre of, then to doe him seruice hard by. For so long as he is out of his maysters sight, he forgetteth in a manner that he is a seruante,  he thinketh he hath recouered his libertye: whereas contrariwise, when he commeth before his maister, he holdeth down his head,  perswadeth himselfe he retour|neth to the coller like a dogge, that for a time hath been let loose.


Guaz.
It were good here that wee came to the distinction of seruauntes: for that which you say of seruantes whiche flie their maisters presence, is not generall,  is to be vnder|stood of y^t nature of vile and base seruantes, not of the good  suche as are gentlemen: who for the moste parte, are neuer well, but when they are in their Maysters presence, and serue hym louinglye and willinglye. Wherevppon it is sayd, That the gentleman loueth, and the slaue feareth.



Annib.
In the distinction which may bee made betweene Gentlemen Courtiers which serue Princes, and the base sort, which serue Gentlemen, is, that the chaynes or Fetters of the baser sorte, are of yron, and those of the Gen|tlemen, of Golde.


Guaz.
I holde well with that difference, and I make good moreouer, that the chayns of Gold, bynd more strongly then those of yron, but I thinke you will not say that Gentlemen, and common Seruingmen, serue with one mynde, or propose to themselues one selfe ende of theyr seruice.


Annib.
I say vnto you, that common Seruingmen hate both their Mayster and the Chayne, where the other loue their Maysters, but cannot away with the chayne.


Guaz.
I cannot see how it can be sayd, that Gentlemen cannot away with the Chayne, seeing they seeke not inter|tainement vpon constraynt or necessity, as the baser sort do, but are naturally giuen that way, not pitching their marke at vyle gayne, as the other doe, but at honour and renowne: I will not speake of others, but of my selfe onelye, assuring you, that the Duke, my mayster, seing that I am vnfitte to serue him, by reason of my sicklynesse, hath appoynted me a better pension to liue by hereafter in my house, then I hadde heretofore when I followed his Court: yet for all that (to confesse vnto you my ambition) I reason this with my selfe, that when I shall liue in rest at my fathers house, I shall be no more then others of my neighbours are, and I shall take my selfe to be as vnprofitable to the world, whereas beeing about that Prince, I am in case euerye hower to pleasure a number of persons, to get friendes daylye, and to make my selfe honoured of the most honourable in the court: by reason whereof, I curse my infirmitye, whiche will not suffer mee long to be bound to this chayne of Gold, which I like aboue all thinges in the world.


Annib.
All men indued with noble myndes, are in loue with that Chayne, not for it selfe, but for the honour whiche is annexed vnto it: and I remember I haue heard your bro|ther say, that he loued my Lady his Mistresse well, but hee

coulde not well away with seruice: and I canne tell you, he hadde shrunke his heade oute of the cotler of hose insup|portable paynes long before that Princesse dyed, if her ex|ceeding bountye and extraordinary fauoures towards him, hadde not kepte him from it. And in truth that constraynt to eate, to speake, and to goe, by the mouth, by y^e tongue, and by the feete of others, that estate neuer to haue rest eyther of bodye or mynde, to loose ones selfe in the seruice of hys Mayster, to bee shorte, those incommodityes, vexati|ons, troubles, and annoyes, rehearsed in a Letter of yours, whereof you haue indured in your owne person a greate parte, fill vp the Cuppe with so bitter a potion, that the smell of it, yea, the verye rememberaunce of it, offendeth nature.


Guaz.
You know well, that a man winneth not the wager without running.

Yet you knowe there are manye whiche runne, but onely one winneth and for one which you see recompen|sed for his seruice, you shall heare a number complayne, that they haue consumed their goods, and hazarded theyr lyues in the seruice of Princes, without gayning other thing then a miserable olde age, with  late repen|taunce, and  there are of them which are not made to burste eyther with trauayle, or with greefe. That Golden Chayne neuer liked mee, and I haue alwayes counted all seruice vnsure and myserable, vnlesse it were one kinde of seruice of a Spanish tleman, who after hee hadde long tyme serued his king, made hymselfe a monke, wryting forthwith to the king, that hee was preferred to the seruice of a greater Prince then he was, of whome hee looked for better wages, then hee recey|ued at his maysters handes. These Seruauntes which enter into the Ministerye and Seruice of GOD; e no doubte lu well both the Mayster and the Chayne, and they are onelye they, amongst all others whiche e in seruing: but for that our purpose is  speke of this earthlye and vncertayne seruice retourning to Gen|tlemen

Seruingmen, I graunt, that for the most part they loue theyr maysters, to whome they are lyke, in life, in mynde, and in manners: and therefore they thinke themselues happye, when they are in theyr pre|sence, and when they haue occasion offered to doe them some acceptable seruice: And as the baser sorte of ser|uaunts, withdrawe themselues so muche as they maye, oute of theyr maysters sighte, to the ende they maye not bee sette aboute anye thing: so contrarylye, the bet|ter sort, thinke themselues in greate fauour, if they bee oftener imployed by theyr Maysters, then theyr Fel|lowes are.


Guaz.
It is for no other cause that Princes are sayde to be better serued then we are, but for that their seruants are Gentlemen, and ours are otherwise: but I shoulde thinke good, you came nowe to shew the maner of conuersation be|tweene the mayster and the seruaunt.


Annib.
Let vs alwayes follow the rule obserued by vs in our discourses,  first let vs shew the occasion of the discorde and inconueniences, which arise euery day amongst the~, and afterwards we will seeke the meane to make all well, and to agree them togither.


Guaz.
I thinke we haue already declared one occasion of it, when we made mention of the difference betweene the~ in life and maners.


Annib.
You say true, but as that occasion is common to the maister and the seruaunt: for here are two others, where|of the one dependeth of the maister, the other of the seruaunt To the one it belongeth to commaund, to the other to serue, so that if eyther of them fayle in their charge, there groweth betweene them trouble and disorder. The mayster commit|teth a fault when he knoweth not howe to commaund, and therefore the Philosopher sayde well, That it behooueth the Mayster firste to knowe, how to commaunde those thinges which the seruaunt oughte to doe: but it is not so easye a matter to know howe to commaunde, as it is to be a mayster.



Guaz.
You must then prescribe vnto the mayster, the ma|ner of commaunding.


Annib.
The manner is set downe, if that he set seruice be|fore commaunding, that is, if he learne to serue before he be|gin to commaunde.


Guaz.
I am of that mynde, for I thinke it a matter im|possible that he should know how to play the mayster well, who neuer had mayster: and for that cause I woulde not chaunge the Duke my Maister for the Emperour, for being vsed euen from his infancy to doe continuall seruice, fyrst to king Henry, and then to king Frauncis and king Charles, his children and successors in the kingdome, and knowing of what importaunce it is to possesse as well the hearts, as the persons of his seruauntes, he vseth a wise, and a gentle kinde of commaunding ouer his Gentlemen. And of the seruice which he doth himselfe, I haue noted two good effects, the one in that induring much trauayle both in mind and bodye, he knoweth by himselfe the payne of his owne seruauntes, by reason whereof, mooued with pittye, hee beholdeth them with a more gracious eye, and commaundeth them more gentlye. The other, for that (notwithstanding he is a greate Prince, and maye liue at his ease) his seruauntes seing him serue continuallye, are stirred vp by his example, to render him obedience, making no account of the payne whiche they indure in his seruice.


Annib.
To say the truth, he sheweth himselfe so worthye and courteous a prince, that he hath mo seruauntes thorow|out all Europe, then in his owne court: but these times are so vnfortunate, that there is no Homer to sette forth the do|inges of such an Achilles. Nowe returning to the faulte of Maysters, we will say once agayne, that those onlye knowe well how to commaund, which know well howe to obaye. And for that few maysters can doe that, there are founde al|most in euerye house, maysters that are vndiscreete, proude, fantasticall, and insolent, which intreate their seruauntes no otherwise then if they were slaues, speaking imperiously to them, being not content, vnlesse they see the~ tremble in their

presence, vsing no speech vnto them but full of terrifying, threatning, and reuiling.


Guaz.
Of such manner of dealing, it commeth that ser|uantes, though good and sufficient, begin to growe naught, and to wax cold in goodwill, and negligent in duty towardes their maisters: but those maisters are more vndiscreet, which braule and chide with their seruauntes before straungers: whereby in my minde they make the straungers thinke they are scarse welcome to their house, and besides, spite thereby their seruants, the most of any thing in the world. For profe whereof, when a seruaunt seeketh a maister, he neuer inqui|reth whether he be couetous or of an ill life, but whether hee be cruell and hard to please.


Annib.
Those are yet worse which speake to their Ser|uauntes with their handes: who belike haue been beaten by their maysters, if they haue serued, and therefore they will reuenge it vpon their seruaunts: or else perchaunce they per|swade themselues that their seruauntes can not helpe them selues with their Poignadoes, whereof I saw an example at Padua. Truely there is nothing that angreth me more then that, for I cannot but thinke very ill of those which triumph tyrannously ouer their poore seruauntes, from iniuring of whom, they ought rather to abstayne, then of their equals: for that it is an act of great bountye, to keepe ones selfe from oppressing those whom he maye easily oppresse. And therfore it behoueth wise maisters to forbeare beating their Ser|uants, remembring that the supreme mayster is not well pleased with him, who will take reuenge out of his handes, and not leaue the punishment of his seruauntes to his diuine pleasure, vnlesse it be for such offences as are punishable by humane lawes. Other maisters are of this fond humour, that they will haue their seruauntes vnderstande their minde, in making only a sign, as if themselues were dumme, and their seruauntes Diuiners. Some will haue their seruaunts doe three or foure thinges at once, not hauing the iudgement to consider that as a sextine sayd, a man cannot cary the crosse, and ring the bels altogether. Some are so curious, that if

they had a thousand seruantes, they would trouble them all, and yet would neuer be content, for that none of them all can please them, whose fashion it is euery moneth to chaunge a seruant.


Guaz.
We haue at the court a gentleman, who about six monethes since, bestowed vppon a seruant of his a liuery cloake, whyche since that tyme hee hath bestowed vppon foure others, and taken it styll from them agayne: and a lyttle before our departure out of Fraunce, hee sente vnto mee in the Euening hys seruaunt to sollicyte a letter of fauoure, whiche I shoulde wryght in the Dukes name a|bout certayne businesse of his: and willing him to retourne the next morning to haue the letter, the next day there came another to demaunde it: to whom as I sayde hee was not the same who came the day before, he answered, Though I bee not he, yet I am in his apparell, which my mayster thys Mornyng pulled from hys backe to putte vppon me.


Annib.
That in my iudgment is a shamefull thyng, and thoughe it bee no dyshonoure to the mayster to vncloathe Peter to cloath Paule, yet at the least he receaueth dishonour in chaunging so oft hys seruants, for hee therby sheweth hymselfe an impatient manne, and harde to please, and besides spreadeth hys secretes and doynges the farther abroade: for when a seruaunte departeth from his May|ster, in what sorte soeuer it bee, whether contented or dyscontented, hee cannot refrayne from reporting where soeuer hee goe, the lyfe and beehauyoure of hys for|mer Mayster: and thoughe wyth one trueth hee myn|gle a hundreth lyes, yet there bee ynowe that wyll beleeue hym: And besides, the Mayster is troubled to time hys new seruauntes to hys fancye. Amongest other yll Maysters maye also bee comprehended some so impatient and so vnreasonable, that they wyll in|ioyne theyr seruauntes to impossibilityes, yea, and ex|acte thynges at theyr handes, before they are com|maunded them: but the worst of all are those who will

burthen their seruantes wrongfully with some naughtye dealing, and therevpon turne them away, keeping * theyr sweet, * and the sweet which is due vnto them for it.


Guaz.
It is an easie matter to finde a staffe to beate a dog.


Annib.
It would be too long to rehearse all y^e imperfecti|ons which are in those maisters which neuer serued.


Guaz.
Yea but those same haue serued and do serue daily, for that they are seruantes to their owne vices.


Annib.
I holde well with your saying: I will therefore passe to the occasion of disagreement betweene the mayster and the seruaunt: which commeth by the seruauntes when they know not how to serue and obay. I meane by the vnfit to serue, not only fooles and ignoraunt Asses, but also disho|nest and knauishe Companions, who though they are sufficient to execute any thing committed to their charge, yet they haue some notable faulte, whereby their Maysters haue iust cause to put them awaye, but it is as harde a mat|ter to fynde Seruauntes without faultes, as Dropsye Patients without thyrst: and though their faultes bee inu|merable, yet their cheefest ornamentes are the three pro|perties of a Dogge, to wit, the gullet, for that they are Gluttons: barking, for that the maister canne doe nothing, but they will forthwith reporte it abrode: which the seruant in the Commedie shewed, saying hee was full of chinkes, whereat went out euery thing which entred in at his eares: next, byting, which is so naturall vnto the~, that let their mai|sters doe neuer so well by them, yet they wil not stick to call them vngrateful, and to speake the worst word in their belly by them: according to the saying of the Poet:
Of sory seruantes, the worst part is the tongue.
But they are worse then dogges, for that besides the proper|ties before spoken of, they are proud and arrogant, wherevp|pon it is sayd,
Of surly seruantes, euery court is full.
That vyce is accompanyed wyth lying (a thynge of all others moste seruile) framing themselues neuer to tell the trueth to their maysters, nor perchaunce to theyr ghostly

fathers: but that were a smal matter, if their faythlesnesse were not so great, that not content with fetching from their maisters in disbursing of their money, and with proloyning from them otherwise, they will not be faythfull in matters touching their honour and credite. I conclude, that their least fault deserueth the Gally, and that according to the say|ing, We haue so many enemies as we haue seruantes: but this is to be vnderstood of the base and rascall sort, for it is not to be said, but that as there are good maisters, so likewise are there good seruantes.


Guaz.
I thinke it well, but to take away all disorder, it is requisite that the good maister and the good seruant bee matcht together: for if they be not both good, it is hard for y^e wisdome of the one, to supply the want of discretio~ in y^e other.


Annib.
I thinke so, but we must here call to mynde, that whiche we haue already sayd, That the golden world being gone, the maister and seruant must thinke, that there is not absolute perfection to be found in any person: and that some imperfections must be borne withall on both sides, so that the best and most necessary partes be not wanting: whiche consi|deration not onlye the seruant ought to haue, remembring that it is his dutye, to submit himselfe to the will and plea|sure of his maister, but the maister much more, knowing that seruantes being for the most part of base condition, and na|turally inclined to do ill, wil not haue that fidelity, diligence, and affection towardes him, as he would haue towardes any Prince that hee shoulde serue: and considering that it were better for him to winke at some faults in his seruantes, then to disquiet himselfe in going about to refourme them.


Guaz.
I pray you then, tell me which are those imperfec|tions, which are to be tollerated in seruants.


Annib
Your demaunde putteth me in mynd of a faulte I committed the other day, in rehersing the imperfections of o|thers: for that which I sayd vnto you generally of tollerable men, suffereth this exception, that it extendeth not to per|sons of the house, who are vnder the iurisdiction of the mai|ster of the house: who ought not to open the way of vyces to

those to whome hee may stop it, but rather to shew himselfe more seuere towardes his owne folke, then towardes others: by the example of Cato, who sayd, He pardoned euery one but hymselfe. And it may well be sayd, that the faults of the ser|uant belong in a maner to the Maister: for if the prouerbe be true, That like man like maister, and that a fishe begin|neth first to smell at the head, there is no doubt, but y^e faultes of our seruantes will be layed vppon vs: eyther for that wee haue taught them, or else that wee take delighte in their naughtinesse. The seruant then shall be intollerable to his Maister in those imperfections, whiche neuerthelesse may be tollerable to others: in so muche that the Maister ought not in any wise to beare with him, but either to tourne him away, or else to make him to amend his faultes.


Guaz.
I doubt me least you will restraine too much the rules of seruantes, and the bond of maisters: for if the father for that he is leted with other affayres, causeth his children to be instructed by Maisters and gouernoures, to whom hee giueth them in charge, there is no reason in it that he should become a teacher of his seruantes who being for the most part peruersly giuen, he should haue muche to do to order them: so that hee should be the seruant,  not they. And for my part, I haue somwhat else to do, the~ to goe ouerlooke my seruantes, being assured that they are occupyed about no goodnesse.


Annib.
I knowe in deed there are some seruantes, who in their maisters presence, looke as though butter would not melte in their mouth, but out of their sight, they will play their partes kindly, yea and will not sticke to make moes at their maister behinde his backe: but the maister must not in any wise suffer his seruantes to commit, either in worde or deed, any fault whereby God himselfe, or his neighbour may be dishonoured, giuing them to vnderstand, that he will en|tertaine no naughtinesse in his house, but that he hateth it mortally: wherby though he be not able thorowly to root out their wickednesse, yet at least he shall make them counter|feyte to be honest, for feare to displease him. Touching some

other naturall imperfections of small importance, as to bee rude, vndiscreet, foolishe, negligent, forgetfull, crafty, quarrelous, spitefull, gluttonous, importunate, stouthfull, bragging, and suche like, they ought to be borne with|all, if they cannot be reclaymed from them: though for my part I thinke suche seruantes better lost then found, and the house the worse that they are in: yet I knowe some honest gentlemen, who so long as their seruantes are fayth|full, and trusty, care not though they be fooles, vaine talkers, or iesters to make them merry.


Guaz.
There was a gentleman at Parris, who going foorth of hys Lodgyng, wylled hys seruaunt to go to a Butcher named Dauid, to buy of him some tripes, but the Butcher hauing soulde all his tripes, hee retourned to his Mayster, who was at the Church hearing a ser|mon, and by chaunce as hee entred in at the Churche, the Preacher (meaning to all ad geioe text of  out of the Psalmes of Dauid) sayde, what sayth Dauid? mary sayth he, that hee hath sold all his tripes, I know not whether that ought to be termed foolishnesse, or pleasantnesse.


Annib.
There are likewise some Maysters, who when their seruantes take their pleasure of them with mockes and scoffes, rather take pleasure in i, then seeme angry with them: like as he, who called his seruant King of fooles, who answered, I would to God I were King of fooles, I would not doubt then, but I should heare rule ouer hym which is better then my selfe.


Guaz.
I could not play the Philosopher so w^t my seruantes.


Annib.
No more could I, but perchance that seruante was so profitable to him otherwise, that he was content to beare that scoffe at hys handes: but for that all May|sters are not so meeke mynded, to bee serued wyth such menne, nor all seruantes so happy, to meet with Maysters that can lyke of them: let vs set downe some such order that the Mayster and the seruant may lyue and continue long time quietly together.



Guaz.
That is it I long to heare.


Annib.
First of all I thinke it necessarye that hee which doeth desire to bee well serued, require in his seruaunte three speciall thinges, that is to say, loue, loyalty, and sufficiency: and such a one that mayster shall easily come by, which shall dispose himselfe to bee a good and louing Mai|ster, following the commaundement of the wise man, Loue him whome thou nourishest, which he shall be forced to doe, if hee will but thinke with himselfe that Seruauntes (though they serue) are men, that they are dwellers with vs, ye that they are our humble friendes, and whiche is more,  fellowe Seauntes whereby hee shall knowe that it is his parte to li gnty  with them, by doing whereof he shall  the good will of his Ser|uauntes vnto him, and  that the  of that say|ing, That so many Seruauntes  haue, so manye   to accused the may|ster,  the seruaes for that we  not enemies, but wee awake the  bee so by  them.


Guaz.
Y but  how those which put that precept in practise findeth  of that you say,  know , y^t there is  more   glori|ous, often the  of the maister: you know well the prouerbe.

Claw a Clowne he will thee Scratch.
Scratch a Clowne he will thee clawe.



Annib.
And for my par  not away to make my  my companyons, in being too sani with them I like wel to loue them, but not to imbrace them.


Annib.
Wee must set boundes and limites to all our do|ings, which we must not go beyond: I hold well with you y^t the maister keep his state  degree, for being as you say haie fellow well met hath his seruaunt, he should shewe himselfe to low minded, and not fitte to commaunde, and to bee as it were a seruaunt with seruauntes, which would redound to his reproch: besides, he should  perceiue that too muche

familiaritie would breede contempte. And therefore men of iudgement behaue themselues with their seruauntes in such sorte, that they neyther make them to saucye by ouer muche familiaritie, neyther to fearefull by ouer muche sueritye: for in no wise let a mayster bee terrible to his Seruaunte, least in frowning still vpon him, hee make him thinke that neyther he loueth him, nor liketh of his seruice, which is the way quite to discourage him: And yet in giuing good cunte|naunce to his seruaunt, he must be wary to obserue fit tyme and place, and if I may lawfully say it, he must haue two fa|ces in one personage, immitating the Sunne, whiche run|ning his course in the skie, one while sheweth a face couered with clowdes, and when those misty vapours are blowne a|waye, it sheweth it selfe cleare and brighte. And as it beseemeth the mayster, abroade and in the presence of Straungers, to cast a graue and sadde looke vppon his seruauntes: so it is his parte, beeing retyred into his owne house, to looke more pleasauntlye vppon them, and to speake more familiarlie vnto them: which is a thing they loue of life, and are thereby incouraged to doe him good seruice. And if the maister be a gentleman that hath in his time done seruice to some Prince, hee ought to call to mynde howe gladde Courtiers are onelye of  good word, or of some suche like small fauour of their Prince. You see then how a Mayster may with his honour shewe curtesye to his Ser|uauntes, and thereby gette their good will and loue, where|by also ioyntlye is purchased their loyaltie and fidelitie, a thing moste necessary for his honour and profite: but for so much as sufficiency (as we haue sayd) must be ioyned to loue and fydelitie, I commit the charge to the maister to instruct his seruaunt in it.


Guaz.
Why then you will make the mayster a schoole|mayster of his seruaunt.


Annib.
Nay rather of himselfe, and that he learne to com|maunde, for if he can commaunde well, he shall bee serued well: neyther must hee perswade himselfe that his Ser|uauntes ought to discharge him of all his affayres, but that

he must take part with the~,  consider that it is no easy mat|ter to gouerne seruauntes, and that the greater number of them he shall haue, the greater will his trouble bee to guyde them: for there fall out many housholde quarrels and con|tentions where there are many seruauntes.


Guaz.
Wherein I pray you consisteth the maner of com|maunding well?


Annib.
In two thinges whereof the one lieth in wordes, the other in deedes: Touching wordes, hee must thinke that there is no seruaunt so well framed to the seruice of other Maysters, but that he must be fayne to receyue newe Lawes of his new Lord: and to knowe of him howe hee shall pro|ceede in his doinges, that hee doe nothing contrarye to his will and pleasure, and therefore he must not thinke that at y^e first dash, his seruaunt is made to his bowe, but hee must ley|surely and pacientlye let him vnderstande his mynde, and speake freely vnto him, as well to make him leaue his olde fashions, which perchaunce hee liketh not, as to frame him to his owne fancye. And if I were to take a Seruaunte, I would rather choose a fresh water Souldyer, whiche ne|uer had serued, then one accustomed of long tyme to ser|uice: for those whiche haue serued in manye houses, haue for the moste parte gotten the habite of some ill qualitie, which they wil hardly be brought to leaue: but one y^t is but rawe in seruice, sheweth himselfe more tractable, more gen|tle, and more fit for al manner of seruice,  the maister com|monly will be better pleased with his good will, then wyth the others skill.


Guaz.
I allow well of your opinion, for it is a thing too hard to change the manners of an old seruingman: who soo|ner changeth his haire, then his habyte which he hath gotte~:  yet a maister for a time, must be faine to vse great patience, and take great paine with a yong seruingman.


Annib.
It is true but to be lesse troubled, let him be sure to choose one of a good wyt, and fit for seruice.


Guaz.
The Count Hector Miroglio our friend had one day good triall of the good wit of a new come seruant: for

hauing sent his other seruauntes about other businesse, after he had made him dresse vp the house, hee willed him to co|uer the tble, which he did, and though that day he yned a|lone in his Chamber, yet his seruaunt set two trenchers on the table,  two stooles, by one agaynst the other. The Count sayde nothing to it, but suspecting the meaning of his man, attended the ende of the play: meate being brought in, so soone as his man had giuen him water, hee sate him downe, which he had no sooner done, but his man hauing likewise washte, sate him downe righte ouer agaynste him. The Count beeing as you knowe, naturallye giuen to bee merry, yet he kept his countenaunce, and let his man alone. Hauing eaten a whyle friendly togeather, the man began to bethink him how his mayster might perchance be athirst, wherevppon hee sayde vnto him, Mayster when you will drinke I praye you make no courtesie to commaunde mee, whereat the Count began to laugh so hartilye, that the poore oole knowing his fault, rose to fetche him drinke, but would sit downe no more.


Annib.
This Countrey surely in my opinyon, bringeth foorth no good seruingmen.


Guaz.
I thinke the cause of it is, for that in this place Princes ldome keepe their Courtes where Seruingmen heefelye learne good behauiour: besides that our nature is such, that we make our selues more familier with our Ser|uauntes then they doe in other places, neyther take wee anye great care to be serued honourably, neatly, and reuerentlye, whereof it commeth, that Seruaunts are vnskilfull and vn|toward in their behauiour.


Annib.
Yet I must saye this for our Seruauntes, though they be no all of the ciuillest, yet they are faythfull  trus|tie: which is a thing more to bee set by, then ciuilitie, fyne|nesse, or brauery. Wee perceyue then (to returne to our purpose) that the Mayster who will be well serued, must not be sparing of his speeche, as well to commaunde what he wil haue done, as gently to instruct his seruaunt in that where|in he is ignoraunt, by telling him of his fault. Nowe hauing

touched the commaunding of Maysters in wordes, wee must speake of their commaunding in deedes. The May|ster commaundeth his Seruaunte in deedes, so often as by his example and deedes he inuiteth him to immitate him: And therefore if hee will haue his Seruaunt carefull and diligee in his seruice, hee must likewise bee carefull a|boute his businesse: for there is nothing that more awa|keth the Seruauntes, then the diligence of the Mayster, as on the other syde it is impossible the Seruauntes shoulde bee diligent if the mayster be negligent. And therevpon it is sayde, That the eye of the mayster fatteth the Horse: Tou|ching whiche purpose, a Philosopher beeing askte whiche was the waye to make Laude bring good store of Corne: aunswered, For the mayster to walke often aboute it, for the Mayster must thinke that his seruauntes will thinke theyr laboure lighte, when they shall see him take suche parte as they doe. Moreouer, he must make his account that they will follow him as well in naughtinesse as in goodnesse: and therefore hee must bee as fearefull to gyue them ill example, as carefull to giue them good example. The Mayster also commaundeth well when he knoweth to vse his authoritye in suche sorte, that he is better serued with the turning of his eye, then others are with iniurious and threatning wordes, wherewith they make all the house to shake: not knowing that (as the Poet sayth)
Great force lies hid in gentle Soueraigntie.
And therefore let Maysters to take heede of contrarying this saying, I will not like a Lyon eyther dysorder thy househoulde seruauntes, or oppresse thy subiects. Now when the Mayster knoweth he hath gotten the loue, the fidelity, and the sufficiency of his seruant, hee must bee carefull  any wise to keepe that whiche he hath gotten, whereto there is nothing of more efficacy then to vse him courteously: ayding hym in hys troubles, visiting hym in hys sicknesse, and bestowing on hym when occasion shall serue, that whiche shall cost the Mayster little, and pleasure the seruant much,

who thinketh himselfe nothing beholding to hys May|ster for the wages whiche hee hath for his trauayle, but onelye for that which he shall vppon his courtesy liberallye bestowe vpon him: And that Mayster is greatly deceyued which thinketh that his seruaunt, whether he bee a Gentle|man or not, serueth him onely for wages withoute hope of o|ther recompense. And therefore let him not forget to re|warde the good Seruaunt, and keepe him alwayes aboute him as a precious thing: remembring that the seruaunte is in a certayne sorte one part of the mayster, and that there is nothing in this life more necessary then a good Seruaunte: Wherevpon it is written, if thou haue a trusty seruaunt, let him be vnto thee as thine owne soule. Lette not the mayster take scorne to heare his reasons sometimes to consult with him, and to gouerne himselfe according to his faythfull ad|uise: for that there haue been founde Seruauntes, who haue more aduaunced and profyted their maysters house, then his Brothers or Children haue. To conclude, the mai|ster ought to vse his seruaunt familiarlye, remembring to intreate his inferiours, as hee woulde bee intreated by his Superioures: which hauing regard vnto, hee will al|wayes flye that detestable vice of ingratitude, and according as hee shall increase in habilitye, hee will aduaunce the state of his Seruaunt,  besides his promised hyre, not faile to recompence liberally, according to his power, the long and faythfull seruice which he hath done him.


Guaz.
You haue as far as I see by one selfe meane, instruc|ted both the maister  the seruant, yet I should thinke it not amisse, that the seruant had some speciall charge giuen him.


Annib.
I giue in charge to the seruant to learne the mea|ning of this old prouerbe, It is a hard matter to make a bed for a dogge: for as a man cannot tell on which side hee will lye, when he goeth turning round being ready to lye downe, so a seruant cannot tell what seruice he may do acceptable and agreable to his maister, being for the most hart variable and diuers. And therefore the maister being of so delicate a nature, hee muste determyne wyth hymselfe to take anye

payne in seruice, and yet all will be scarse ynough to contene him but he must take heed of falling into the common errour of seruauntes, who like a new broome whiche sweepeth the house cleane, serue diligentlye at the first, but after growe slouthfull: That is not the waye to gette fauour, for not hee which beginneth wel, is worthy of recompense, but he which perseuereth in wel doing. And the seruaunt must thinke that his mayster will looke that he should rather heate then coole himselfe in seruice. Let the seruaunte also conforme all his thoughtes and doinges to the will and pleasure of his May|ster, and to tye the Asse (as they say) where his maister will haue him tyed, without any contradiction: for there is no|thing that spites a man more, then to see him who is bounde vnto him, and who ought to obay him, to make resistaunce a|gainst him. That he goe not about to creepe in credite with his mayster by flattery or hipocrisie, but to serue and obaye him with an vnfaigned hart: for by faygned words men ga|ther an argument of faythlesse deedes, whereby his mayster beginneth to suspect him,  to thinke that he had more neede be ouerlooked, then instructed: but in any wise lette him not forget to doe his faythfull and true intent, not for feare, but for duties sake: like as a good wise fellow answered to one, who sayd vnto him, If I take thee to my seruice, wilt thou be an honest man? Yea, sayd he, though you take me not. And for that all seruice is ill bestowed, which is not well accep|ted, and that there is no greater greefe then to serue and not to please, when after certayne proofe he seeth that he cannot frame himselfe to his maysters fancy, let him seeke to depart from him rather with his good will then his ill: And when he seeth that he is in his maisters bookes, let him there holde him, saying in his heart, Happy is he, who serueth the happy, and not seeke chaunge, remembring that the rolling stone getteth no mosse. To be short, let there be no want fou~d in him of loue, of reuerence, of faithfulnesse, of diligence, of warinesse, of readinesse, of secretnesse, lette him not accounte of his owne life, being in his maysters seruice, and lette him perswade with himselfe eyther (as the prouerbe is) To serue

like a hinde, or runne away like a hart.

It now commeth in my head, that we haue not orde|red our matters as we should haue done, for that wee haue spoken of the conuersation of priuate maisters with the basest sort of seruauntes, whereas wee shoulde fyrst haue spoken of the Conuersation betweene the Prince and the Cour|tyer.


Annib.
We fayd yesterday, that Princes had no neede of our instructions, and therefore it is not needefull to pres|cribe vnto them any orders how to entertayne their traine: for they behaue themselues in their courtes honourablye peacibly, and quietly, they iniury not their seruaunts, either in wordes or deedes: neyther are those disorders to be seene in Princes, Courtes, as are commonlye in pryuate hou|ses: to be reeft, they are euery way faultlesse.


Guaz.
Seing you are so loth (whatsoeuer the matter bee) to set down any fourme of co~uersatio~ to princes, yet would it might please you to prescribe some order at least to their ser|uants, that our discourse may be no way defectuous.


Annib.
Besides that it is now late, and that I am called a|way to other businesse, you know we are eased of this labour by him who with his learned penne hath most perfectly four|med the Courtier.


Guaz.
That Gentleman by the excellencye of that worke hath no doubt won to himselfe immortall fame, neyther hath he omitted any thing belonging to the duty of a right cour|tyer, but for all that I would it might please you to obserue the order of a diligent Phisition, who besides the receytes of other Phisitions, wil be sure to minister to his Patient som|what of himselfe.


Annib.
I will not stick to giue you two receites, if one be not ynough: And for that it were to doe wrong to gentle|men to propose vnto them those simple  common things, to witte, the loue, fidelitie, diligence, and reuerence, whiche is due to Princes, I giue to a Courtyer this receyte, that the Prince being as we sayde yesterdaye, a God on earth, it behoueth him to doe him honoure as to a sa|cred

thing: remembring that when the Athenians denyed Alexander deuine honours, this voice was hearde, though but Heathenish: Take heede least while you beholde Hea|uen, you loose the earth. Beholde the fyrst receipte. The other is compounded of two drougs which I haue fetcht out of the shoppe of an excellent Philosopher, the one of whiche or both, the Courtier vsing, may long time maintaine him|selfe in his princes fauour: These are abstinence, or else su|ger soppes.


Guaz.
I pray you expound your compound more plainlye.


Annib.
I will doe so in these two verses.

Before their Prince let Courtiers silent be,
Or let their words be faust with pleasaunt glee.



Guaz.
O how short pleasures are, I did not thinke it had been so late. Now after the delicate meates you haue made mee taste this three dayes, I hope it will please you to mor|rowe to close vp my stomacke with that Collation or Ban|quet whiche you haue alreadye promised mee, that with that Suger in my mouth, I maye departe after to morrowe to the Duke my Mayster: who by his Letters hath sente for me for some affayres of importaunce.


Annib.
I will be with you to morrowe not as you say to sweeten your mouth, but to take my leaue of you: whiche would be very sower to me, but that you haue put me in hope of your speedy returne.


Guaz.
I doubt not but that you take pleasure in my pre|sence, for that you know I honour your singuler vertues: but you may wel thinke the pleasure whiche I receiue by your presence, is so much greater, by how muche the patient hath more neede of the phsition, then the phisition of the Pa|tient: I will not say I haue any longer neede of you for to be healed, but to keepe me in health, which by your meanes I haue recouered.


Annib.
I haue perceiued rather by the discourses passed betweene vs, that you are rather a Phisition then a Patient.


Guaz.
You are not ignorant how in this my sicknesse I vsed solitarinesse in steeede of a remedy, whereby I could not

haue chosen but haue shortne my dayes: and therefore you made me know my fault, whereby I went about to make my self a graue,  letting me vnderstand that conuersation is y^e right medecine for such diseases, you taughte me to discerne good company from ill, you put me in minde of the generall points which all men mighte to obserue in their behauiour, and  the pertiuler poins agreeing to euery one in con|uersation and company, as wel abrode as in the house, by the operatio~ of which medecine feeling (God be thanked  you) my hart healed  lightned, I may be bold to say that I haue likewise recouered the health of my body.


Annib.
I know I haue neither fully satisfied you nor my selfe in these discourses, but I am sure you are not deceiued in affirming that ciuile conuersation helpeth muche the in|firmitie of the minde, for there is nothing in the world which teacheth vs more wit or better maners, or which stirreth vs more to wel doing, or keepeth vs back from ill doing, then y^e company and conuersation with good  vertuous men: ney|ther are you deceiued, in saying y^t the health of the body ofte~ proceedeth of the health of the minde, for our Galen sayth, The disquiet of the minde breedeth the disease of the bodye: and that he hath cured many diseases by bringing the pulses into good temper, and by quieting the minde: but being not so wel skilled in curing diseased mindes as I shoulde be, and knowing my selfe to haue neede of Phisicke, I will be with you to morrow to delighte you, though I bee not able to doe you good.


Guaz.
I will attende you with great deuotion: but I pray you come sooner then you did to day.

Finis.
Here endeth the third and last Booke.
