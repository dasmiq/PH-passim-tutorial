To that little Flock in and about the County of Hartford, the Author sends Greeting.
SIRS,
WHEN I take a View of the Wonderfulness of Gods Providence in bringing me first among you, together with those Bonds of Love, by which I am held so fast, that it is my quoti|dian and daily study, how I may be further capacitated to serve you, and the Church of my Lord Iesus; Verily, I must confess, you are the People that have all my thoughts: And besides this, you are those who have the greatest interest in my Prayers; Others have some of my heart, but next to God you have all my heart, I have heard much of the love of a Minister to his People, as that I could scarce give credit unto

it; but I do now believe it, because Ex|perience has taught me so, though that by which I am obliged unto you is not the same as with a Minister and his People, it being only a sincere Love be|gotten by my frequent, painful and la|borious Preaching unto you, without any further charge, and yet notwith|standing how do I love you, and pray for your happiness in this World, and the World to come; I can't endure to think of your damnation, no, not any of you. I am sick at the heart (many times) through fear, lest I should rise up in judgement against some of you, because there are those amongst you, that seem to takeiittle notice of God, Christ, and their immortal souls, though through grace all of you are not molested with the Contagion of this Distem|per, which is so Epidemical, not on|ly in foreign Places, but likewise in our English Island, as that it doth ma|ny times occasion Floods of Tears to run down from the eyes of Gods precious Servants, who, as so many

Lots, do bewail the iniquities of this Land. Sirs, I have thought good to reach you with my Pen, when my Tongue cannot; and hence it is, that I dedicate this unto you in part, though it is possible I could have found out many others, whose Names I might affix in the Frontispiece of this Book, only my Love is most endeared to you; and wherefore do you think it is, that I should concern my self so much with you; would you know, take then these few Reasons.
First, because God made me not al|together for my self, but for you and others; we were not made for our selves, and therefore we act most like beasts, when we only minde our selves, and not others, who are our Kinsfolk, according to Creation; but when that goodness that is in us is so diffu|sive, as that it leads us forth to suc|cour those who srand in need of our help, then we act as our selves, and like rational creatures, it is God that created me, and why did he create me, but that I should serve him, and in what



better way can I do it, then in the first place to seek my own salvation, and after that, the salvation of you and others. But,
Secondly, the End of my Creation is not all by which I am induced to concern my self thus with you, but likewise the End of my Redemption requires me so to do; I, you, and all of us were no sooner created, but we fell from God; and through Adhe|rence to the Devil, lost that glorious Image which he had invested us with, and thereby forfeited the favour of God, and so became the Children of Wrath; but now Iesus Christ, that immaculate and spotless Lamb of God, who knew no sin, became sin for us, by assuming the humane nature, and taking upon him the guilt of all our transgressions, Isa. 53.6. How then can I, you, or any of us, be slothful in Gods service, when he hath done so much for all of us as he hath done; May we not say as Bernard did con|cerning Christ,Dilexisti me Do|mine ma|gis quam ipsum. Thou hast loved me, Oh Lord, more then thy self! And

now the End wherefore Christ did all this was, that we might be restored to Gods Image again, and to serve him in all manner of holiness; And in no better way can I do this, then in look|ing after my own soul and the souls of others.
Thirdly, the End of my Redempti|on doth not only require me thus to concern my self with you, but likewise the End of my Sanctification.
I am sanctified (as I hope) and am washed with the water of Regene|ration. Now it is the duty of those who are sanctified, to lead other in the way to Sanctification and obedience of the Spirit; This our Saviour lays down as a Rule to Peter, That when he was converted,Luke 22.32. he should strengthen his Brethren. But
Fourthly, the very End of my Mi|nistry requires me to have a diligent care of your souls; 'Tis a duty of us who are Preachers of the Gospel, to pity and look after poor souls that are in their blood; and God, yea, An|gels and my own Conscience do bear

me witness how I pity your souls, and that I could go hundreds of Miles barefoot o do any of you good, though never so mean in life and descent; I was devoted from the Womb to the Ministry; and now when I come forth unto it, shall I not in any wise answer the end thereof, the Lord for|bid.
Fifthly and lastly, not onely the End of my Creation, Redemption, Sanctification and Ministry; but like|wise the end of my Preservation doth thus oblige me to you: Hath God done for me what he hath done, and shall I not to the utmost do what I can for him; Hath he wrought such deliverances for me, and shall I be slack and negligent in his service, far be it from me, and all those who have experienced the like that I have; And hath he more|over kept me hitherto, and must I not seek his glory; to such perverse walk|ing the Lord put an end: Many o|ther Obligations there are, by which

I am bound to look after you; (viz.) I am a dying Creature, and therefore whilst I have life I must act for God, because when I am in the Grave I cannot write unto you, My Preach|ing-Work then will be over; And hnce it is, that I do think it meet, whilst I am in this earthly Ta|bernacle, to put you in mind of these things, and to stirr you up to the doing thereof; And as the consi|deration of my Mortality should move me to do what I can for God; and you see likewise the consideration of yours should make you more willing to hear and re|ceive,Post mor|tem nulla Paeniten|tia. what I and others do both Preach and write unto you.
And now, Sirs, what remains, but that you would follow those Pra|ctical things,Christi re|verese Tri|bunal. which the good Spirit of God may by these Lines put you in minde of; Consider, you must one day render an Account for all the good Sermons that you have heard; the Word will either prove a

savour of life, or of death; you will either be the better for Sermons, or the worse, and therefore to you now I speak, that have often heard the voci|feration of the Gospel, but are not as yet reformed; Consider, af|ter Death comes Iudgment,Scio Domie Iesu quod districtus ar|biter mnium ven|urus clandestina hominum facta  verba cogitta in lucem proferes. Grhard de extre|mo judicio. and then what will you do, will you not wish that you had taken the good Counsel of God given by his Mini|sters, will you not then re|member these Sermons which once you, forgot as soon as ever you went out out of the Church, and will not the remembrance thereof be as a Worm gnawing of your Con|sciences in Hell,
Oh with what shame and confusion will ye then be cloathed, when all those secret sins, which you thought were impossible to be brought to light, shall be made manifest before the Lord Ie|sus, who is () light it self. Moreover, consider that without you have an Advocate, thee is no standing

at this Tribunal, and who is this Ad|vocate, but Iesus Christ will plead to the utmost for you, if you can but make sure of him, for without him nothing can be done, in order to your being sheltred from that wrath of God, which then shall be revealed on all those who have slighted this Advocate, and have accounted Sermons of no worth, further believe and consider, that if you have not the Lord Iesus to stand as your friend, you must be thrust down into Hell, and there howl with the damned for ever: And what think you now of these things, do you stedfastly be|lieve them; if you do not, search the Scriptures, and there you will finde what I have said to be true; if you do believe them, why then do some of you live, as if there were neither God, Heaven, Hell or Iudgement; if these things are sincerely believed by you, stir up then, and lay hold upon God, and claim of him deliverance from wrath to come, for it is hastning apace, and w unto you if you lay up nothing

against this burning wrath of God for the time to come, is as sure as the time that is present, why there|fore are you all for the present time, assure your selves, that the walking in repulse against these Considerati|ons, and the sweet motions of the Spi|rit will make you smart one day. But
Finally, if you will all observe these things to do them, what a blessed Meeting shall we have, how wide will the Gates of Heaven stand open for u? what a Welcom will God the Father give us, the very thoughts of it doth glad my very heart and soul; Suffer there|fore the good Word of God to take Impression upon you; Endeavor to live a life of Grace here, that so you may live a Life of Glory here|after; Persevere in all good, hold out to the end, for the Crown will make amends for all: Be constant in the use of means; Follow Peace with all men, be useful in your se|veral

Vocations, that in all things u may be fit for the being received  into the Heaven of Heavens; hich is and ever shall be the desire d Prayer of him,
Who is, SIRS, Your Souls Friend, THO. POWELL










PAULUS in his Unconverted state AEtatis suae 12.

Evangelus.
WELL met,The first Salutation. Whaso|ever is sin|full, is de|lightfull to the car|nal eye. Friend; Whi|ther are you going?


Paulus.
I am going to see a Play, for they say it is very well worth ones obser|vation.


Evangelus.
How! to see a Play? I would not have you for a World,It is the work of a Minister to antici|pate every sinful en|terprize. could I but hin|der you, I would, for there is nothing but wickedness and Profaneness for your Contemplation; and if this is worth your observation, judge you.


Paulus.
You talk more like a Phanatick then a Civil and honest man,A car|nal man knows no difference between things spiritual and temporal, 1 Cor. 2.14. for I verily believe, there may be as much

good gather'd from the observation of such a sight, as somtimes hearing of a good Sermon.


Evangelus.
A ReprofOh, what Prodigious and black ig|norance is this, to think that more be|nefit may be received from open Pro|fneness, then from hearing the Word of God; Have you not yet known the difference between evil and good.


Paulus.
How will sinners plead for the satis|faction of their sen|sual desires from evil examples. An An|swer o the aforesaid Plea.There are some (I believe) as good and as wise as your self, that goes to such places; and certainly, if it be lawful for them, it is lawful for me.


Evangelus.
That is true friend, if lawful for them, then it is for you; but it is not lawful for them, and therefore let such be never so wise, yet if they go to such Places as you plead for, they do in that fall short of being wise men; And moreover, herein is shewed much of your folly in grounding lawfulness for the same, on no other Foundati|on, but because such and such do so, whereas we that are Christians

should endeavour to make our lives congruous with the Sacred Writ, yea, that which the Prophets and Apostles have built upon should be our Foundation.


Paulus.
Pray,Eph 2.20. This is a Proverbial speech a|mongst the Natura|lists. Sir, keep your breath to cool your own Pottage, for every Tub must stand upon its own bot|tom, therefore catechise not me, for I will not be catechised by you, and as long as I have a mind to go, I will go.


Evangelus.
Friend,The End of our Creation are these two. 1. The Glory of God. 2. The good of each other. be not so touchy, for I mean you no hurt, nothing I am o you: it is true, and that every Tub must stand upon its own bot|tom I know, yet considering that very one was not made for him|self, but for the Glory of God, he good and benefit of each other,

therefore it does behove us to be giving one another good Counsel; If you know any thing more then me, I'll learn of you: and if I know any thing more then you, you shall learn of me if you please.


Paulus.
Nay, this is very fair, I must needs confess.


Evangelus.
Divine contive|ment.Well then, my friend, if it may s please you, to deny your self of going t that Place, first intended by you, I wi then tell you what we will do in stea thereof.


Paulus.
I don't much care if I do fo once.


Evangelus.
What think you then of going t yonder Grove; where we may sit down in the shade, and discourse concerning Soul-Affairs.


Paulus.
With all my heart, good Sir.


Evangelus.
Providen|tia guber. nat omnia.Well Friend, seeing then that Go

his Providence has bin pleased to ring us into one anothers Company; ill you give me leave to ask you a w Questions?


Paulus.
Yea, Sir, and I shall thank you oo.


Evangelus.
What do you think then concerning Heaven?Practical Question.


Paulus.
It is a good place, no doubt.


Evangelus.
Yea, and how happy shall we be if we can but get thither.


Paulus.
Why, do you question getting thither?


Evangelus.
Yea, that I do;Heaven, though it is a Saints, yet it may be call'd in question by a Saint. Wicked men think, they bring assurance of Heaven with them into the world. Don't you?


Paulus.
No, I did never questi|on getting to Heaven, since I have been born, I thank God for it.



Evangelus.
Questi|oning of our selves is a de|monstra|tion of our sincerity.I am apt to think, you might ha had more cause to bless God, for qu|stioning your title to Heaven, the for not questioning it; and I am  opinion, that you and others w scarce get to Heaven, except yo come first to doubt of your righ thereto.


Paulus.
Strict God|liness in the eyes of the World is censu|ring.You are the strangest man that  ever met with in all my life; and in|deed this is the fault which I find to be in you Phanaticks, viz. you censuring.


Evangelus.
Friend, you mistake us, and I sup|pose you do not very well understand me, for did you not say just now, that you questioned not getting to Heaven.


Paulus.
Yea, I did, what of all that?


Evangelus.
A Soul-searching question.I only then ask you, the Grounds on which you build your hopes for Heaven so stedfastly, without the least questioning assurance thereof.



Paulus.
The Mercy of God,Natura|lists think God has no other Attribute, then his Mercy to glorifie. We are fallen with Adam. no better rounds can there be.


Evangelus.
The Mercy of God that's true, iend; but Gods Mercy has bin rfeited long ago through our diso|dience in Adam, have you now ined it: if you have, pray tell me w, and by what means?


Paulus.
Nay,Matters of sublime spirituali|ty, are new things to the car|nal eye. if so, the Lord look down on me, for I never heard of this fore.


Evangelus.
It is very true, my Friend; and ce it is, that we have brought  with us into the World, by ich we are made the Heires of ath.


Paulus.
Be you sure, this is true.



Evangelus.
Do you believe all those Truths c|tained in the Holy Bible?


Paulus.
Do I believe them yea certain or else I should be a Papist or an Ifidel.


Evangelus.
Then see this prov'd from these  Places of Scripture, Psal. 51.5. I  shapen in iniquity, and in sin did  Mother conceive me; And Eph. 2 We are by nature the children wrath,Cum mul|tis aliis. even as others. So Rom. 5. l By one man sin entred into the wor and death by him, and so death  over all men, for that all ha sinned.


Paulus.
Nay, here is Scripture enoug none can deny.


Evangelus.
A true Miister, i loth that any should perish, and go out of the World mistaken.Well then, seeing  it is as I say, had I  Grounds (do you thin for speaking what I di and therefore I pray 

willing to give me some further sa|faction touching the belief of your vation.


Paulus.
NayFaith can puzzle carnal rea|son at any time. you have so puzled me, that w I know not what to do, except it to tell you, that I pray Morning d Evening.


Evangelus.
Well, what of all that? I hope you not expect to get to Heaven by your ayer, do you?


Paulus.
YesUpon this Rock many are split. I do, or else I know not how to  to Heaven.


Evangelus.
Oh Friend,Whether ignorance is the Mo|ther of De|votion, I leave it for you to judge; but ignorance, I am sure, is the  that breeds high thoughts of our selves, and low  of our Lord Jesus. had you been acquaint| with godly Ministers, or any of ds People, and desired their Instru|ons, certainly you would have bin  now acquainted with the way that  to Heaven and eternal Happi|s, for thou art grossly ignorant thinking to be saved by Prayers.



Paulus.
I don't say Prayers only,  take in Reading of good Books, a hearing of good Sermons.


Evangelus.
Eph .5, 8. By grace ye are sa|ved.Nay, it is all one for that,  if you take in all good Works what ever, they will prove insignificant merit salvation.


Paulus.
Say you so, why I never heard  from our Minister, and he is a  good Church-man.


Evangelus.
Nay, as to that I know not, but  I'le assure you, that what I have hea from you, as yet does rather savour Popery, then of true Christianity.


Paulus.
There is a ind of zeal to be found in Natura|lists.How! a Papist, Sir; God forbi for I am sure I am so far from bei a Papist, that if I do but meet  one, I go the other side of the  because I will not see him. I do hate him.


Evangelus.
So Carna|lity affects.Perhaps you walk more by custo

then by judgement; for I'le assure you it is as I say.


Paulus.
Pray Sir, tell me then, what must save me, if good works cannot; Thanks be to God I met with you: or else I should have died in this mi|stake, notwithstanding our Mi|nister.


Evangelus.
Why thus you see,What a sad con|deration is this, that when God has sent hi Son into the World he is not known by the best part of . Friend, Gods deal|ings with us are various; but to gra|tifie your desire, let me ask you this Question; Did you never hear of Iesus Christ? Here has not bin so much as one word concerning him.


Paulus.
Nay, hold you; I have heard of Jesus; what of him?


Evangelus.
What of him why it is he that must save you.


Paulus.
Its no marvel then, why I have heard such a talk concerning Jesus Christ, but I ever thought it was my good works that must save me.



Evangelus.
Behold the vast difference between a believer, and an un|beliver; One de|pends up|on Christ for salva|tion; and the other depends upon du|ties for salvation. A true Believer is willing to be nothing, so that Christ may something, whereas an unbeliever acts to the con|trary.Nay, Friend, I will shew you an in|suffiiency in that; and likwise, that sal|vation is only to be had in Christ, and by him you must be saved, if ever sa|ved; Receive these Scriptures for the truth of both, Rom. 3.20. Therefore by the deeds of the Law no flesh shall be justified in his sight; for by the Law is the knowledge of sin; So the 28th. verse, Therefore we con|clude, that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the Law, Gal. 2.16.


Paulus.
Why then, by your Reckoning, I have all my work to begin before I can get to Heaven.


Evangelus.
If you understand no more then this, I must needs say, you are far from be|ing a new creature; and if far from be|ing a nw creature, then far you re from the Kingdom of Heaven.



Paulus.
How do you prove that?


Evangelus.
I prove it from these following Scriptures, Mark 16.16. He that believeth and is baptized, shall be sa|ved; and he that believeth not, shall be damned. So Luke 13.3, 5. I tell ye, nay, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish, Iohn 3.3, 5. Veri|ly, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God; And what think you of thse Scriptures?


Paulus.
Why, I think they are very good; but if I have all this to do, as you say, and am still to begin the Christi|ans A, B, C; then I had as good de|sist a little while, seeing that as yet I am but young, and so for a time take my pleasure: and when I come to be old, I'le then take this way to serve God which you have prescri|bed; for I am afraid lest I should not hold out in serving God another way, in regard that I have taken so much pain in the other, for indeed I am spent.



Evangelus.
Oh Friend, give not way to the De|vil these are only his suggestions, be|lieve him not; for can you serve God in a more acceptable time then in the days of your Youth; Consider, I pray you, these following things.


First, Consider your Youth; God requires Eccl. 12.1. Remember your Creator in the days of your youth.
Secondly, it is a Question whether you may live to an old Age, which if not, what will become of you.
Thirdly, grant that you live to an old Age, it is a Question whether the day of grace may last so long.
Fourthly, if the day of grace should last so long, it is a question, whether you will not, through the pains and imbeci|lities of old Age, be rendred incapable to serve God.
Fifthy, Consider you may serve God when it is too late, but you can never serve him too soon.


Paulus.
Verily, this is true, I cannot deny it; but do you not think, that God is more glorified by an old Convert, then by a young.



Evangelus.
When you have such suggestions as these, endeavor to make them abortive at their birth; for any will tell you, that there is nothing more acceptable unto God, then when a young man offers up the Flower of his Age unto him; yea, and what does conduce more unto Gods glory then the same.


Paulus.
Well, I am now convinc'd of my folly, especially of confiding in good works for salvation.


Evangelus.
Well, bless God for it; and now see|ing, through infinite mercy, an insuf|ficiency in good works to save you, what think you of God?


Paulus.
Why, I think that he is a Spirit.


Evangelus.
He is so,Joh. 4.24 imonide the more he stuied to know what God was, the harder still it seemed unto him. God cannot b defined. my friend, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.



Paulus.
This I knew a great while ago.


Evangelus.
Very good, are there more Gods then one?


Paulus.
Ya surely, there must be three Gods; God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.


Evangelus.
Know, Friend, that thou art woful|ly ignorant; for though there be three Persons in the Godhead; yet thse three are but one in substance all this while; there is but one individual Deity; as the Fire does contain in it three Properties, 1. Its self. 2. Heat. 3. Light. So though there be but three ways of subsisting in the Godhead, yet all this while it is but indivi|dual.


Paulus.
Pray Sir, is there any Scripture for this?


Evangelus.
Yea, Scripture enough; see Deut. 6.4. Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord, Isa. 44.6. I am the

first, and I am the last, and beside me there is no God, Isa. 45.22. Look unto me, and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth, for I am God, and there is none else. So 2 Cor. 8.4, 5, 6. and Eph. 4.5. 1 Tim. 2.5.


Paulus.
I confess these Scri|ptures do hit me;Some do think, if they do but read Gods Word, it is sufficient, thoug they take no notice o wat  contained therein. for how many times have I read the Bible over and yet do not remember these places.


Evangelus.
You minded then well what you read, for certainly, if you had read diligently, and with a desire to know, you would have given a more perti|nent Answer to such a Fundamental and Practical Point of Divinity as this. But this is not all, our Souls are spirits, Angels are spirits, and the D|vils are spirits; what difference is th then between God and these?



Paulus.
Why, I suppose he is bigger then all of them.


Evangelus.
Bigger then all of them; this is no solid Answer. God, he is an incre|ated Spirit, all others are created; God, he is an infinite Spirit, all others are finite.


Paulus.
Nay, this is very good.


Evangelus.
Well, I am glad you like it, but what difference is there between the Devils and the Angels.


Paulus.
Why, I suppose they are both Spi|rits, and both Angels, only the An|gels in Heaven are the good Angels, and the Devils are the evil ones.


Evangelus.
Thou sayest right; the Devils th are now in Hell were once righteous Angels, but through pride and ma|lice they are now become, of all crea|tures, the most miserable; but where do the Devils inhabit?



Paulus.
I suppose the Devils do dwell in Hell,Chrisu Leo dici|tur, propter fortitudi|nem, Ag|nus propter inno entiam: Leo, quod invictus: Agnus quia mansuetus. Ipse Agnus occasu vicit Leonem, qui cir|cuit quaerens quem devoret, Dibolus Leo dictus eri|tate, non virtut. Aug. it being a Place prepared for them and the wicked.


Evangelus.
The habitation of the Devils is,Habitatio Diablo|rum est prtim A partim in|ernus pu|tat. Aug. 1.8. de Civ. Dei. c. 22. Illos usur|passe erem ad exer|cenda sam dominationem in homines, vult Ambros. in p. ad Eph. Ipsos antequam ad detiora conversissent, ris ad|ministrationem habuisse, tradit Theodor. epitom. divin. Decret. Denique Lombard l. 2. snt. dist. 6. cap. solet. Author est, Luciferum, Principm Diabolorum, reli|grum manre in inferno, nec a nos tentendos acce|dere: alios vero Diabolos alternis vicibus huc   ferno ad animos hominum cruciandos vel deduce  ad infernum venir, qui liis sucedentibus ipsis  tantur in infernum. partly in Hell, and partly in the Air; The Devils do dwell in the Air unto the Day of Iudgement, and usurping the same, on purpose that they might rule in the hearts of men; But what difference is there between the spirits and our souls, for our souls, you know, are spirits?



Paulus.
Nay, I believe, now you ask me that which you cannot answer your self.


Evangelus.
Angeli sic ois exc|nt, ut in|rnis con|templai|onis gau|dils non priventur. Greg. Tres vita|les Spiri|tus ce|it Omnipotens: unum, qui carne non tegitur; alium, qui carne tegiur, sed non cum carne moritur; alium, qui carne te giu,  cum carne moritur; Primus An|gelorum, ecundus Hominum, tertius Brutorum est. Alsed.Think not so, friend; for the An|gels were the firs Creatures that God made, whereas our souls are not: the Angels are not covered with flesh, but our souls are; the Angels are perfect spirits, but our souls through union with their bodies are imperfect and impure; but enough of this, what think you now of Iesus Christ?


Paulus.
Who is Jesus Christ; why he is the Son of God?


Evangelus.
It is true, my friend, he is so; for God the Father testifies it, Mat. 3.17. The Chuch acknowledgeth it, Matth. 16.16. And the Devils confess it,

Luke 4.41. But who do you think of these were first, God the Father, or God the Son?


Paulus.
There is a question indeed, surely the Father must be before the Son.


Evangelus.
Yea, friend, that is true; it is so in natural generation,Prov. 8. John 10 30. Ego  Pater su|mus unum. Christ is equal with the Father according to his Di|vine Nature, but inferiour according to his Hu|mane. but here it is not; for Christ Iesus is co-eternal with his Father, and equal with him in Power and Glory.


Paulus.
This will not stand by reason.


Evangelus.
Divine Mysteries are not to be ap|prehended by carnal reason, for he who would see by an eye of Faith, must shu out the eye of Reason; and what think you now of the Holy Ghost?


Paulus.
Why, I suppose he is God too, is he not?



Evangelus.
Yes, he is so; see 1 John 5.7. For there are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, Word and Holy Ghost, and these three are one.


Paulus.
Nay, this is very evident, you bring Scripture (I say) to prove what you say.


Evangelus.
Well, if so be you do believe what I have said concerning the blessed Trini|ty, say with me, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.


Paulus.
God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.


Evangelus.
Right, what think you now of the Creation of the World; did God make the World of somthing, or of no|thing?The Phi|osophers  this Maxime, Ex ihil hil fit.


Paulus.
Of somthing surely; for out of nothing, nothing can be made.



Evangelus.
Friend, what do you think Creation signifies?


Paulus.
Truly, I know not very well.


Evangelus.
Why, it signifies a making all things of nothing.


Paulus.
Say you so.


Evangelus.
Yea, and have you not read that the World was made only by the especial word of his Power,Oid! Metaph. After th old Cha|os was brought into form the Poets did feign, That the World was divided into four Ages The first was the Golden Age, the second was the Silver Age; the third, the braen Age; and the fourth, the ir Age: The four Ages whereof by Perdic is compared to the four Seasons of the Year the first, resembling the Spring time, the second Summer, the third Autumn, the fourth Winter. Munus magnu homo, homo parvus, mundus esse dicitur. not that we should understand that any word did really proceed from God, but only that he will'd it.


Paulus.
Did God, do you say, only speak th word, and was this World made;

I cannot believe this, except you bring me Scripture.


Evangelus.
If Scriptures will convince you, I'le bring you Scriptures enough. See Psal. 33.9. For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast, Heb. 11.3. Through faith we understand that the Worlds were framed by the Word of God, so that things which are seen, were not made of things which do appear. So Rom. 4.17.


Paulus.
Mundus est Specu|lum Ari|butorum De.All this now is very clear unto me.


Evangelus.
When we receive any benefit from God, we should keep une with the Palmist. enedi|ite, bless ye the Lord.I am glad of it, and therefore bless God; And now tell me, I pray you, what you what is your belief concerning the Incarnation of our Saviour?


Paulus.
I do believe that Jesus Christ did come into the World to save sin|ners.



Evangelus.
And that he was made Man.


Paulus.
No, I cannot think so, in regard that it is impossible for God to be|come man.


Evangelus.
Herein thou art grossly ignorant, because thou doest believe Christ came into the World, and yet cannot think he was made man.


Paulus.
No, nor I shall not, except you give me good Scripture for it.


Evangelus.
Nay,The Bere|ans were commen|ded for examin|ing of the Apostle Pauls do|ctrine; H Mysterium est absconium a seculis, patefactum in tem|pore, Paradoxum  impossibile visum Iudais  Gen|tibus aestimatum, dpiis tanquam maeria sotidi Gau|dii  consolatiis. you are to be commended for that, because you are not to take any thing from me, or any man, without Scripture, and therefore, if Scripture will do the business, Scripture you shall have enough:

See John 1.14. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth. So 1 Tim. 3.16. And without controversie, great is the Mystery of Godliness, God was ma|nifest in the flesh, justified in the Spi|rit seen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.


Paulus.
I see Scripture does hold forth this truth but who would think that this should be so.


Evangelus.
de in Beam in lib. Confession is Christianae fidei c. 3. artic. 19.It is so, and that for these Reasons, as I sup|pose. 1. Gods Iustice by Man was offended,Deus homo fit, ut ho|mo divinae gratiae  na|turae particeps fit. Ger|d. med. 14. p 52. there|fore by Man it was to be satisfied. 2. Christ was Man that he might die, for had he not been Man, he could not have died. 3. He was Man, that he might sympathize and condole with us in all our conditions and infirmities. 4. He was Man,

that he might be dompleat Mediator. 5. He was Man, that he might make Man Partakers of the Divine Na|ture.


Paulus.
Then by this reckoning you must make Christ a sinner.


Evangelus.
So he is (i.e.) by Imputation.Jesus Christ is the greatest sinner in the World (saith Luth) by imputation.


Paulus.
This is strange doctrine, me|thinks, to make Christ a sinner;  if also he is man, then consequentially he is not God.


Evangelus.
Your consequence is false,Vide Bezam i lib. Co|fessionis Christianae fidei p. 13. c. 3. rtic. 20. my Friend; for Christ is God-Man, God that he might sa|tisfie,1 Tim. Man that he might die, 2.5.


Paulus.
Well, these things are very deep and profound, therefore (I pray you) ask me somthing else, and I will me|ditate

upon them when I come home.


Evangelus.
Very good, the next Question then shall be this, what think you then con|cerning the Resurrection?


Paulus.
Truly, Sir, this has been ever ob|scure to me, I could wish you would inform my judgement concerning it.


Evangelus.
This ruth the Sad|duces de|nied, Mat. 22.23. The great Mystery contained in this Truth, made the Philoso|phers to dream of a Transformation, one body being trans|form'd into the shape of another, or a Transmigrati|on oul, taking its flight out of one body into another. They could not think that one numerical and indivi|dual body, after it is corrupted in the water, consumed by fire, converted into earth, vanished into air, nay, eaten up by fishes, and those fishes eaen by men, it was above them to think, that this same body should rise again. When Paul disputed this Point at  the great Philosophers of the Epicurs laughed at him, What will this Babler say? They lookt upon this as babling.With all my heart, for I like this en|quiring mighty well; Now that there shall be a Resurrection, it is evident from these Places of Scripture, Dan 12.2. And many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting 'contempt: Iohn 5.28, 29. Marvel not at this, for

the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the Graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth, they that have done good, unto the Resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the Resurrection of damnation. So see 1 Cor. 15. and Rev. 20.12, 13.


Paulus.
Well, this truth I also believe; for I see, there are many Scriptures for the demonstration and proof of the same.


Evangelus.
What think you now concerning the last Iudgment, do you believe it or not?


Paulus.
I do believe that Jesus Christ will come at the last day, and judge the world.


Evangelus.
And are you willing, friend, that I should try your knowledg in this neces|sary truth.


Paulus.
Willing, why do you think I should be unwilling: pray don't question that, for I am so willing, as that I shall look upon you as my best friend, if you take the pains to inform me in this.



Evangelus.
Well then, seeing that I have such a free access unto you, I shall ask you these several Questions, in order to your better understanding of this great truth; what then is the last Iudgment?


Paulus.
Extre|mum ju|dicium, est quando Dominus Iesus Christus in adventu suo, cum virtue magna  Majeate, extremam omnibus ho|minibus, juxta sua facta sententiam feret aequam  irrefragabilem, tum pils, tum impiis, aut ad vitam aeternam, aut ad supplicium aeternum. Et hoc fre|quenter debemus meditari cu Hiernymo, qui ait; Quoties illum diem considero, toto corpore con|tremisco; five enim comedo, sive bibo, sive aliquid aliud facio semper videtur illa tuba terribilis sonare auribus meis? Surgite mortui, venite ad judiclum.The last Judgement is a day (as I suppose) wherein Christ Jesus our Lord and Saviour, shall come down from Heaven with great Glory, to judge the whole World, and give unto every one according as his works shall be.


Evangelus.
Very well (my friend) for your Answer pleases me exceeding well, but how ma|nifold is the coming of Christ?



Paulus.
How manifold is the coming of Christ; why, is there more comings of Christ then one?


Evangelus.
Yes,Christ coming threefold. Venit Christus occulte judic|dus, venie  mani|este judi|caturu. friend, the Scriptures do hold forth unto us a threefold coming of Christ; the first was in the flesh about sixteen hundred years ago, when he came in the forme of a servant, taking upon him our sins; the second is, his co|ming now with the Power of the Gospel, in the hearts of sinners; and the third is, his future coming, when he shall in the end of the World come in glorious Glory, not to be exprest: And this is called his second Appearance to Iudge|ment, Acts 10 42. Christ is appointed by God the Father Iudge both of the quick and dead. So Acts 17.


Paulus.
These are wonderful things, pray tell me now, how Christ will judge the World?


Evangelus.
Visible in the clouds; for even as he ascended, so shall he descend; but wherefore do you think, my Friend,

Christ will judge the World?


Paulus.
That he may render eternal life, with fulness of joy unto the godly, and eternal punishment to the wicked.


Evangelus.
You answer right, but what do you think will be the Order of this Iudge|ment?


Paulus.
Truly, Sir, I know not very well.


Evangelus.
Antece|dent, Con|comitant, and Sub|sequent.My friend, observe, there are certain Transactions that do prcede this day, certain Transactions done in the day, and certain Transactions that does en|sue this day.
First, some things there be that ar antecedent to, or coming before this day, which will be these, 2 Thes. 2. 1. A Subversion of the Roman Empire,Mat. 24. and the Man of Sin revealed.Luke 21. 2. The Rising of false Christs, and false Prophets. 3. Signe that shall be in the Sun and Moon. 4. The Gospel being preached through out all Nations. 5. Obedience yielded unto the Gospel by Iews and Gentiles

and all that do pertain unto the Election of Gods grace.
Secondly, those Transactions done in this day are these. 1. The Son of Man shall be seen in the Air. 2. The dead shall rise, both righteous and unrighte|ous.Mat. 25. 3. Christ shall separate the bad from the good, and denounce the last sentence.
Thirdly, that which follows this day, is the proportioning of a reward unto every Mans work; and now tell me what thou thinkest of these things?


Paulus.
Truly, they are things that I never knew till now.


Evangelus.
Bless God then for what you know, and answer me this question, Is the Iudgement-Day known unto any or no?


Paulus.
None but unto God, as I sup|pose.



Evangelus.
Thou sayst right, for neither Men nor Angels know this day, but God him|self, Matth. 4. And thus, friend, I have shewed you these Points of Divi|nity, to be believed of all that seek after an eternal life of Felicity, being these as follows, 1. God, or the Trinity. 2. The Creation of the World. 3. The hypostatical Vnion, or Christs assu|ming the humane Nature. 4 The Re|surrection. 5. Iudgement. I come now to ask you how and by what means you may come to know God?


Paulus.
By the Holy Bible.


Evangelus.
It is true friend, the Scriptures, con|teined in the Old and New Testa|ment, is the only Rule by which we may come to know God and serve him  but tell me what thou doest understan by the Old and New Testament.


Paulus.
By the Old Testament I understan the Writings of Moses and the Pro|phets, and by the New Testament th Writings of the Evangelists and A|postles.



Evangelus.
Your Answer as you should do; But are the Scriptures sufficient of them|selves to work faith in us or no?


Paulus.
Truly, I am not able to determine of that.


Evangelus.
Why then I will tell you, the Scri|tures of themselves cannot work faith n us, but by Gods Spirit cooperating ith them; and hence it is, that the ord is called a dead letter,2 Cor. 3.6 not but hat the Word is quickning, but be|ause the Word of it self without the Spirit, cannot so much as work any race in us.


Paulus.
This I do believe.


Evangelus.
Then I hope you do believe the Scriptures to he so Canonical, as that t is Blasphemy to esteem of any other Writings, to be of equal Authority with the same, and so consequentially hose are to be blamed who annex the pocrypha to the Bible, and do fre|ently take out certain verses con|teined



therein, as their texts, whenas the Scriptures, and only the Scriptures, are for a standing Rule in Gods Church.


Paulus.
But is not the Apocrypha the Word of God?


Evangelus.
No, for they were not written in the Hebrew Tongue, nor acknowledged a Canonical by the Iews of old, to whom the keeping of the Oracles of God was committed.


Paulus.
I am now convinc'd of that, which I thought I should never have been perswaded to the contrary.


Evangelus.
Again, if you do grant the Scri|ptures to be infallible, you must then grant that the Scriptures are not to be ruled by the Church, but the Church by the Scriptures.


Paulus.
If so be the Scriptures do not de|pend upon the Church, for the Truth and Authority thereof, how then can we be assured that it is the Word of God.



Evangelus
Friend, herein you are grossly mistaken, for we may be assured of the Scriptures being the Word of God; which may be prov'd from several Te|stimonies and Arguments divine and humane;I 2.59.1. 1 John 2.20, 1 Cor. 2.10. 11, 12, 13. 2 Cor. 2.21, 22. from Testimonies Divine, being two, internal and xternal; One is the Testimony of the Spirit, who sometimes by special Rvlaion and Power do declare the  there|of, upon the Hearts and Cnscenes of Men and Women; and th is the divine internal Testimony: The d|vine external Testimony is the Scri|ptures, testifying of themselves; and hence it is many times,2. Ti 3.16. 2 Pet. 1 20.21. that they do run in this Order, (Thus saith the Lord) Thus saith God.
Now the Arguments to prove the same, are deduced and taken from. 1. The efficient causes of the Scriptures, viz. Men, te Calling, Miss and Insperation of whom was divine.
Secondly, the Scope and End of the Scriptures being the glory of God, and the eternal salvation of our souls.
Thirdly, the subject-matter of the Scriptures, which is so full of Majesty and Divnity, as that it is far beyond humane capacity to comprehend. This is sufficient to shew the Authority of the Scriptures, without depending upon the Church. Thus is the truth of the Scriptures, and the Authority of them evidenced without the help of the Church.


Paulus
Is not the Testimony of the Church then of some use?


Evangelus.
Yes, that I deny not, but the thing which I aim at is to shew, that the Au|thority and Truth of the Scriptures can be made apparent, from Gods Spirit, and from themselves, without the help of the Church, which assertion does contradict the Papist, who does au|daciously affirm, that the Authority of the Scriptures do absolutely depend up|on the Church, the absurd consequen|ces of which opinion are these. 1. Of

all, to hold that the Scriptures has no more Authority, but what the Vniversal consent of the Church gives unto it, is to make the Scriptures no otherwise, but a Nose of Wax, yea, it is to make the eter|nal and inviolable truth of God, rest up|on the pleasure of men; verily the matter and scope of the Scriptures is to be denied and to be of no use at all, if this opinion is right, these and such like are the Ab|surdities that must of necessity be held by retaining opinions of this kind.


Paulus.
But did not Austin say, that he would not believe the Gospel, save that the Authority of the Church mo|ved him thereto.


Evangelus.
The Papist do give a false interpre|tation upon his words, if we do but con|sider the whole tenor of his writing. For as Calvin well Observes, Austin had then to do with the Manichees, who ar|guing with them, spoke thus, I my self would not beleeve the Gospel, save that the Authority of the Church moved me thereto. Meaning, that he himself when he was a stranger from the faith,

could not otherwise be brought to em|brace the Gospel for the assured truth of God, but by this that he was over|come with the Authority of the Church. And what marvel is it, if a man not yet knowing Christ, have regard to men, therefore Austin does not there teach, that the faith of the godly is grounded upon the Authority of the Church.


Paulus.
I am very well pleased and satisfied in what has been said, have you any more Questions to ask me?


Evangelus.
Yes, friend, I have many Questions to ask you still. How do you prove, that Salvation is only to be had through Christ?


Paulus.
How do I prove it? I prove it from Acts 4.12. where it is thus written, Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other Name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.


Evangelus.
Thou hast given the right Scri|pture;

but now, if salvation is only to be had in and through Christ, does it not, do you think, concern you to have an interest in this Christ?


Paulus.
Yea, certainly that it does.


Evangelus.
Are you then interested in him?


Paulus.
Truly, I question it, but how may I come to have an interest in him?


Evangelus.
That must be by faith.


Paulus.
What is faith?


Evangelus.
Faith is a receiving of Iesus Christ into the Heart, as he is Priest, Prophet and King, with a fiducial de|pendance upon him, being fully satis|fied, that there is salvation, in, through, and by none but him. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen. Heb. 11.1.



Paulus.
How is this Faith attained?


Evangelus.
Rom. 1.17. 1 Pet. 2.2.It is attained by a conscientious use of the Word, and increased by Prayer and Sacrament.


Paulus.
What is Prayer?


Evangelus.
Ou Prayers are our Sacrifices, and Christ alone is the Altar, where on we must offer them to God the Father.Prayer is the pouring out of our souls unto God in the Name of Christ, by the help of the Spirit, and with faith on the Promises, for those things which are agreeable unto his Will.


Paulus.
Prayer is the wing, wherewith the soul fly|eh to heaven, and Meditation the eye, wherewith we see God. Amb.
Whether it is lawfull pray unto Angels?This I remember, for it has been told me a great while ago.


Evangelus.
You understand here|in, I shall examine by asking you several questi|ons concerning this duty; as first, ought we to pray unto God, and only unto him?



Paulus.
Only unto him, excepting Saints and Angels.


Evangelus.
How do you mean Saints and An|gels? I hope you don't hold praying to them.


Paulus.
Nay, I cannot think any otherwise, but that it is lawful to pray to them, for they are those who do make a way unto God the Father for us.


Evangelus.
I deny it,John 14.6 and therefore shall affirm, that Christ only is the way to the Fa|ther; but that I might further clear this truth, observe, 1. Prayer is a part of Divine Worship, (which all grant) and God only is the object of Divine Worship, therefore to pray un|to any besides God, is a perfect violation of that Command, Deut. 6.1. Mat. 4.10. Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 2. Consider, we have but one In|tercessor and Mediator in Heaven,2 Tim 15. and therefore it is a high affront unto Christ, to make any use of others in

that kind. 3. Consider that excellent place of Scripture, Rev. 19 10. And I fell at his feet to worship him; and he said unto me, see thou do it not, I am thy fellow-servant. And in the last place, consider here is but little en|couragement for any of us to pray unto Saints, because the best Saints in Heaven is ignorant of our conditions here below, Isa. 63.16. John 14.21.


Paulus.
Why, truly all this is clear, none can deny.


Evangelus.
Well, friend, what think you of this question? can one pray, and not speak?


Paulus.
No, surely, that can't be.


Evangelus.
Yes, one may, for there is vocal Pray|er, and mental Prayer: Vocal Prayer is the expressing our desires unto God by the words of our lips;Mat. 69. and Men|tal Prayer is the offering up of our desires unto God without the help of words, as Hannah prayed when her voice was not heard. 1 Sam. 1.13.



Paulus.
How may I pray, so as to finde acceptance with God?


Evangelus.
First, direct your supplications unto God. Secondly, Pray in faith, Third|ly, with a sense of your wants. Fourth|ly, with a sense of your unworthiness, to have any of your wants supplied. Fifthly, with Sincerity and Perseve|rance. Sixthly, beg what you beg in the Name of Christ. Seventhly, con|clude your Prayer with a Doxology, being this, For thine is the Kingdom,Mat. 6. Power and Glory, for ever and e|ver. Amen.


Paulus.
I thank you, good Sir, for this sea|sonable advice.


Evangelus.
What think you now of the Sacra|ment?


Paulus.
It is an Ordinance instituted by Jesus Christ himself.



Evangelus.
Est Pro|missionis divinae sigi num a Deo institutum constat au|tem Ele|mento  verbo, ut extt me|moria Pro|missionis.A Sacrament is a seal of the Cove|nant of grace, whereby as God doth ob|lige himself to give unto us all the be|nefits contained therein, so we in like manner do by that oblige our selves to be the Lords, and to be true and faithful unto him.


Paulus.
This I now do understand.


Evangelus.
Very good, now how many Sacra|ments are there of use in thi Gospel Dispensation.


Paulus.
Surely, there are but two.


Evangelus.
There are but Sacra|ments in the Chri|stian Church.Thou sayst right, and therefore the Papists herein are to be blamed, wh say there are seven Sacraments, where|as we do deny any such number, and do affirm, that there are but two Sacra|ments, viz. Baptism and the Lords Supper: Baptism is a Sacrament, wherein the washing with waer, in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, doth signifie and seal our ingrafting into Christ; the

Lords Supper is a Sacrament wherein these things given, viz. Bread and Wine are signified, exhibited and shew|ed forth unto us; the Body of our Lord Iesus which was broken, and his blood which was poured out abundantly for the remission of our sins. Circumcision and the Passeover was in the Law, in room whereof comes Baptism and the Lords Supper; Baptism in the room of Crcuncision, and the Lords Supper in the room of the Passeover.


Paulus.
In this I am also very well satis|fied.


Evangelus.
I am glad of that;Of Tran|substanti|ation. but what think you of this? Is the bread really tran|substantial, and turn'd into the Body of Christ?


Paulus.
Yes, that is really my belief; for does not our Saviour say, This is my Body, 1 Cor. 11.14.


Evangelus.
Friend, believe it not; because there is not Grounds whereupon Reason should be built, much less faith; Observe

what I have to say contradictory to it; and you will finde, that such an opinion is against Scripture, Sense and Reason. Consider, these words (This is my body) is no proper but figurative ex|pression; were all Scriptures to be un|derstood literally, then there would be some reason for the understanding of this expression, to be as you would have it.


Paulus.
What do you tell me of Figures? surely, our Saviour would have spoken more plainly to his disciples than so, especially in the instituting of an Ordinance.


Evangelus.
Christ spoke intelligible enough; but tell me, is not that plain enough, when we take the words as they are frequently and commonly used in Scriptures.


Paulus.
Yes, That I can't deny.



Evangelus.
Well then,Three Ac|ceptations of a Door in Scri|pture, threefold, 1. It is an Entrance into the heart, Cant. 5.4. Psal. 24.9.2. Church, Iohn 10.1 3. Heaven Mat. 25, 10. these words are common and frequent in Scripture, John 6.14. is thus written, I am the Way; so John 10. I am the Door; Christ properly is no Door, but only as a Door is an entrance into a Place, so Christ in this respect is an entrance into Hea|ven; Now compare this with the o|ther Place of Scripture, (This is my Body) the true meaning is, This is a figure, sign, and Pre-Presentation of my Body; (This is my Body,) that is, as Bread doth nourish, strengthen and refresh the Body, and satisfie the natural appetite, so the Body and Blood of Christ, received by faith, doth strengthen, nourish, refresh and sati|ate the spiritual appetite. Observe, I pray you, how oppugnant this is to reason; for is it not absurd, that bread should be turn'd into another substance, and yet the accidents re|main the same; there is the colour, ase and smell of the bread; if the bread in the Sacrament is turn'd into the real Body of Christ, then the Nature  End of a Sacrament would be destroyd

the nature of a Sacrament is to be a Sign, and the Ends of it is to be a re|membrance of Christ, both which sup|poses Christs Body to be absent. A|gain observe, our Lord Iesus mentions Bread after the words of Consecration, saying, (the bread which we break,) 1 Cor. 10.16. He that eateth this bread, 1 Cor. 11.27, 28. If the bread is turn'd into the real Body of Christ, then wicked Communicants may receive Christ, and Christs Body must be in a thousand Places at once; and now what say you unto all this?


Paulus.
I see now, as you say, that this o|pinion is oppugnant unto Scripture, Reason, and our three senses, viz. Seeing, Smelling and Tasting; I wish with all my heart that I could stay a little longer with you, for the benefit which I have received from you is unconceivable, but I am sent for an Errand and therefore cannot; yet if you please to inform me where you dwell, and what is your name, I shall thereby be much obliged unto you.



Evangelus
That you shall my friend, I dwell in such and such a place, my name is so and so.


READER.
AS Concerning this young man, being so willing to defer his Re|pentance unto an old Age, was the main Suggestion, which did keep him off from Closing with Jesus Christ (of whom is shadowes in this Dia|logue, and signified by Paulus) to|gether with his beleeving that God was more glorified by an old Con|vert, than by a young one, but when you come to understand how God dealt with this young man in bring|ing him off from all those letts and Impediments, by which he was kept from Closing with Christ, you will admire, it being in form following.
This young Man, as aforesaid, be|ing much molested with Temptati|ons of that kinde; One day above the rest, a Small-coal man going a|long

the streets, did measure some thereof unto a Customer, who ha|ving no sooner done it, but he im|mtely fell down dead, (although he was as well as I am now at this pre|sent writing) which being noised a|broad, and many coming to see him, he made one; who seeing him to lie dead on the ground, was ama|zed, especially when he understood the suddenness thereof.
Thus, after a little Contemplation upon him, he goes home; falling down upon his knees, saying to God, Lord have mercy upon me; and this was all he could say for an hour together, (somtimes it was) Lord have mercy upon me a sinner, and pardon my sins; thus continuing for the space of many weeks, despair|ing of Gods mercy to his soul; and being also convinced of his former ignorance, he is now glad to receive good Counsel from any body, his minde and will being changed, makes him to believe, that there is salvation only in Christ, and looks now upon

all his duties, (as a Pauls in|deed) accounting them but dross and dung compar'd with our Lord Christ.
But one day more than the rest, praying to God, does earnestly beg of him for a pardon of all his sins; Thus Expostulating with God for the attainment thereof, Lord, (saith he,) Thou hast given a Pardon unto some, and why not unto me? what way and course therefore may I take for the obtainment of the same; and immediately at his request, (after the performance of duty) the Lord was pleased to give in this Text of Scripture, Isa. 55.7. Let the wick|ed for sake his way, and the unrighte|ous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon; from hence he gathers hopes of Gods mercy unto his soul, but in temptations his hopes vanished a|way again; as to those other Scriptures

which the Lord was pleased to han forth unto him, for his stay and com+fort in his journey to the heavenl Ierusalem, is conteined in the ensuin Dialogue.
And observe, what now treateth o him, is about his converted estate; being the second Part.
The End of the First Part.




The Second Part, being YOUTH in his unconverted state AEtatis suae 16.

Evangelus.
WELL met,A Salu|tation a before. Friend; how is it with you now?


Paulus.
Now I wonder at my self,Especi|ally of his future |state. how norant I have bin; and especially f my being so unconcern'd with my  estate as I have.


Evangelus.
Yea,The worke of God upo a convert| soul is one of the greatest wonders and mira|cles in the world. Friend, when God is pleased to  a sinner a sight of his fearful  out of Christ, he is startled, and  amazed, at the consideration of  former security therein.


Paulus.
I have found it so, blessed be God  you.


Evangelus.
And blessed be God also, for that rovidence which brought us then to

gather, and which now has vouchsafed another like opportunity, wherein we may confer about the things of another world? how therefore (my friend) ha God dealt with you since I last parted from you?


Paulus.
God (I hope) has blessed what then you said unto me, the verity of which has bin set home, by a specia and extraordinary Act of Provi|dence.


Evangelus.
What kinde of Providence (I pray friend) has been exercised towards you since I last saw you?


Paulus.
That, Sir, which the Lord was pleased to hand forth unto me (by you your self,) in answer unto those two suggestions, wherewith I was heretofore troubled, has bin second|ed by the sudden death of a poor Small-coal-man.


Evangelus.
How, I pray?


Paulus.
He was going along the streets,

who was measuring of a few Small|oal to one of his Customers,A Decla|ration of Gods Work up|on his soul, and the blessed effcts it has produ|ced, which may serve as an I|tem to o|thers. God must have all the Glo|ry, because it is he that work|eth all our works in us and for us. did mediatly fall down dead, al|hough he was as well as now you nd I are in body, that the sight of is dath together with the sudden|ess thereof, did startle me, and shew|d th vanity of protracting and de|erring time and repentance as I id.


Evangelus.
Oh! Glory unto the Father, Son and Holy Ghost be ascribed for ever! Oh, ow is your heart affected with this!


Paulus.
I am so unsatisfid in minde, as that does render me very incapable f performing any service unto God.


Evangelus.
Be sure you give not present Enter|ainment unto any thing suggested, ithout special examination, what is  therefore in which you are unsa|sfied?



Paulus.
Either to despair or presume, is many times our condition.In Gods mercies.


Evangelus.
How so, for when you knew nothing you could then render unto me God mercy, as grounds sufficient, on whic you built your hopes of salvation Then (my friend) you had no cause s to to do, but now you have, I dar say.


Paulus.
A con|verted soul is mighy inquisi|tive.I do suppose, it is all one for that inform me, I pray you, then, how I may come to obtain Gods favour and grace; for I find, as once you tol me, that I have lost it in Adam.


Evangelus.
Friend, as Gods favour was lost in Adam, so it is found in Chrit, see therefore the favour of God i an through Christ.Joh. 14.6.


Paulus.
I must first come to Christ and re|ceive him, before I can make use of him to reconcile me unto God, wher|as my faith is weak, and will not as yet lead me unto him.



Evangelus.
Does that faith which thou hast, as|sent to Gods Essence; and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him.


Paulus.
Yea, I think it does so, if my heart deceives me not.


Evangelus.
Well, if so, then you have that which will commend you to Iesus Christ, and not only commend you un|o him, but likewise that which will nable you to receive him see Heb. 6.1. For he that cometh to God, must be|lieve that he is, and that he is a Re|warder of them that diligently seek him.


Paulus.
God will (I see) make use of you to do my soul good, but what do you think now of my Condition?


Evangelus.
Why, I do believe that thou art an lected Vessel,


Paulus.
What is the reason do you think hen that I should be all this while



without an assurance of Gods Lo and mercy to my poor soul.


Evangelus.
Wait, and thou shalt have it, an consider well this Scripture, being Ma 9.17. Neither do men put new win into old bottles, else the bottles break and the wine runneth out, and the bottle perish: but they put new wine into ne bottles, and both are preserved. Fro which I would have you to note, tha though God has his saving work i your soul; yet many corruptions ther are unsubdued, which must be mortified, before he sees it meet and conveni|ent to give you assurance; nay, unti then, perhaps God sees you uncapabl as to the management thereof.


Paulus.
A sincere Saint bles|eth God for every mercy.Blessed be God also for this goo Counsel and Advice.


Evangelus.
If it has proved so to be, I desi to bless God likewise.


Paulus.
Sir, being in haste, I must bid yo

farewel; but I shall consider upon what you have said.


Evangelus.
Farewel then,They part from each other. but I hope I shall see  again


Paulus
That you shall, for I cannot  ee you now and then.




YOUTH in his CONE Etatisuae 18.

Evangelus.
Ministers are glad when they can have any op|portunity, wherein the Work of the Lord may be carried on.OH, my good friend, how glad a I to meet with you, for I will asure thee, thou hast been much up my heart; where has been your abo all this while, that I have sought you  frequently, but could never have t happiness to finde you until now.


Paulus.
Whether (Good Sir) you a glad to see me I know not; but I a sure, I am glad to see you: for m wants and indigencies are innum rable and how to express them un any other (but your esteemed sel I know not: in regard that hereto fore you have been very benefici unto mee. In the like strait th now I am in, wherefore (worth Sir) if the presen opportunity do serve as well for you, as it does 

e, Administer something of Com|rt unto me I pray you?The suf|ferings of our Lord Jesus, are not only applicato|ry, but ex|emplary.


Evangelus.
It is a duty, my friend, incumbent pon those who are Preachers of the Gospel, to imitate their Lord and Sa|iour, and to tread those same steps, herein he before them did tread, who lways made the extremity of sinners, is opportunity to do his Fathers Work, nd the like must I; speak on therefore, nd welcom.


Paulus.
I am in such misery,These two extreams undoes many, el|ther we are prone to think our con|ditions better then they are, or worse then they are, Job 19.2 Miserius nihil est misero se non mise|rante. None are in misery but they that can't pity them|selves. that I know ot what to do; my Condition is ch that I am asham'd to make  known, and my crimes are so hor|id, that for a great time I have con|ealed them, and loth I am still to di|ulge and bring them to Light. Oh! herefore pity me, pity me.


Evangelus.
Why dost thou say, thou art in such misery, as that thou knowest not what to do; I can't chuse but give hee a check for saying thus, upon these several respects.
First, we ought not to despair  long as we have a God, which inde we have, 1 Sam. 17.46.
Secondly, there is no malady so r mediless, but God can apply a Reme thereto; no wound so sore, but God ca eal; no misery so anxious and irr coverable in our apprehensions, but  can extinguish the anguish there heals it, and makes that which is i possible with us possible with himsel Gen. 18.14. There is no misery th side of Hell and the Grave, but Go out of his infinite free grace hath ap pointed some proper means for th same, viz. hearing and reading th Word for the unconverted, Prayer an receiving of the Sacrament for th weak in Gifts and Graces, and Chris unto all in general, who will receiv him by faith, Mat. 11.28.
Thirdly, why doest thou say, tha thy condition is such, as that thou ar ashamed to make known; was not a our conditions once s, for a natural condition is a damnable, cursed and ig|nominious condition, Eph. 3.
Fourthly, why doest thou make the aggravations of thy sins as an Argu|ment to conceal them; whenas God in his Word has said, He that hideth his sins shall not prosper.
Finally, David used the aggrava|tions of his sins, as an Argument with God to Pardon them.


Paulus.
Do you think (good Sir) that I am not a miserable creature, when the Sin against the Holy Ghost is im|puted to me.


Evangelus.
This is a cunning stratagem of the Devil;The sin a|gainst the Holy Ghost is a final im|penitency. Augusti|nus intel|ligt per|catum in Spiritum sanctum,  au fina|lem im|paeniteiam in iis, qui non accipiunt Evangelium aut desperationem. Qui haec peccata proprio pug|nant cum gratia   abjiciunt. Nam cater peccata, cum fugimus ad gratam remituntur.

Ideo sic interpretatur Augustinus dictum Christi: Qui dixerit verbum contra Spiritum sanctum, id est, qui bum gratia, quod praedicatum,  confirmatum est Testimoniis spiritualibus, finaliter repudiat, is habet peccatum in Spiritum sanctum.
Peccatum in Spiritum sanctum est, cum quis divina veritati,  quidem Evangelio cujus fulgore sic perstringitur, ut ignorantiam causari nequeat ta destinata malitia resistit, in hoc ut resistat. Alsted. for those who have committed this sin, have never the Gift of Re|pentance, their hearts are so hard as that they cannot mourn; and indeed, the great reason rendred, why the sin against the Holy Ghost is unpardonable, is, because there's no repentance for the same; bat now this is not thy case.


Paulus
Sinners under heir first convicti|ons, takes themselves to be of all most miserable.Ah, but you do not know the misery that I am in.


Evangelus.
You cry out of your misery, but you do not tell mee wherein it does con|sist?


Paulus.
The Devil doth what he can, to divert us of those opportunities, which he thinks may prove most ad|vantageous unto us, ma|ny times by deseing we are hindred from effecting what we hindred.My misery I would fain express, but I cannot, I see there|fore that this oppor|tunity will prove to be a lost opportunity, unto my soul, and O wretched man as I am: That I should make a Non-Improvement of those

precious seasons which might be so exceeding advantagious unto me, I shall only now desire of you to ap|point another time wherein I shall to the utmost (if God willing) lay open my deplorable Condition unto you.


Evangelus.
But heark you (my friend) do not think that I can be put off with such a frivolous excuse as this,As the Devil does en|deavor to hinder Mini|sters, from doing their Fathrs Work, so Mini|sters, in like manner, does endeavor to hinder the Devil from the Accom|plishment of his cruel De|signes. shall we meet together and go away without profit to each other, this is a temptation of the Devil, therefore ad|here not to it.


Paulus
Sir,The De|vil can frame ex|cuses at his will. business does call me home, and I am also under such an indisposi|tion of body, as that I cannot talk any longer with you?


Evangelus.
What then,It is the duty of Christians to pray one with another. shall we not pray before we part, if you will, I'le joyn with you.



Paulus.
No, (Good Sir) do you, and I will joyn with you.




A PRAYER Performed by the MINISTER.
O Most Glorious and Gracious Lord God, from everlasting to everlasting thou art the great Creator of Heaven and Earth, and the wise Disposer of all things which thou hast made; We the most unworthiest of all thy servants, do desire to prostrate our selves before thy Divine Majesty, under an humble acknowledgment of thy Goodness, thy Grace, thy Truth and Faithfulness: thy many mercies renew|ed  continued every day to us, and our great unworthiness of the least of them: We are not worthy of the crumbs that fall from thy Table; not only because we were born in sin, but because we have liv'd in sin, and have daily added to our sinnes, by the vanity of our thoughts, words and actions, and the unsuableness of the whole man to all

thy Commands: We are ignorant of them, yea, we have digged to our selve Cisterns that will hold no water; W have doubted of thy Promises, broken thy Laws, polluted thine Ordinances, Profan'd thy Sabbaths, abused thy Mercies, slighted thy Iudgements, sin|ned against the light of our own Con|sciences, against Grace receiv'd, a|gainst the motions of thy Holy Spirit, against Heaven, and in thy sight, and we are not worthy to be called thy children; and therefore most iustly mayst thou pour down thy displeasure upon us, and empty the Vials of thy wrath upon us and ours; it is mercy, nay, infinite mercy and free grace, that we are this side of Hell and the Grave, but much more that we have an oppor|tunity to plead with thee; how many are there in Hell, that would give ten thousand worlds for what we enjoy and have; We bless thee (O Lord) for Iesus Christ, by whose blood these Mercies were Purchased, and the Priviledges which we now enjoy, re|ceive him for us, and accept us in him,

magnifie thy grace in and through him towards us, by pardoning our sins, re|miting our transgressions, sanctifying our nature, washing our souls in the water of Regeneration, and by eviden|cing thy favour unto us under all our cloudy and gloomy dispensations; and this is that (O God) which we are come about at this time; it is the Sun-shine of thy countenance, and strength a|gainst our adversary the Devil. Be|hold, O Lord, thy servant before thee, that is molested by Satan, and burried with his temptations. Behold, O Lord, the enemies which he hath to wrestle with: how are they increased both from without and from within; increase his faith, that his spiritual existence may be sustein'd; let him not perish in his distress and warfare for want of thy assistance; seeing, O God, that we sue not to thee for any ter|rene or earthly enjoyments, but for grace, that we may through strength received, therefrom be enabled to repel and quench all the fiery darts of the e|vil one; and therefore for the sake of thy Son Iesus hear us, and strengthen

thy servant, whereby he may now at ist conquer Satan, who has so much deavored to overthrow him: Ap|ear for him (O blessed Iesus) unto hom all Power is given in Heaven nd in Earth; and being tempted, nowest how to succour those that be empted. And with us, sweet Father, e mindful of all thine throughout the hole World; Bless thy Church and Zi|n, bring home Iews and Gentiles, and ll that belong unto the Election of thy race; Give unto thy Son the Hea|hens for his inheritance, and the ut|ermost Parts of the Earth for his Possessions. O Lord, keep up England rom falling from thee, let it not lan|guish nor decay in Godliness and let ot wantonness under the means of race procure any want of grace; thou ast divided us, bring us together a|gain; And thou who art a God of Order, O settle Order in thy Church, d Vnity among thy Saints; Let uch as do erre out of ignorance, learn nowledge; and such as have sinn'd against knowledge, finde repentance; Endu the Magistrates with the know|ledge

of thy Spirit of Grace and Wis|dom, as well as with Power, that w may live a peaceable and quiet life un|der them, in all godliness and honesty. O let thy Ministers be cloathed with holiness, write it on their Breasts, give them the Urim and Thummim, and let them shine by holiness of life, as well as by doctrine, and Crown all their la|bours with a Garland of Souls.
Remove not (O Father) thy Candle|stick from us, for our unworthiness of it, and unthankfulness for it; but pardon our unproableness under it, and teach us to profit more and more; And now, O Lord, comfort thy afflicted Servant before thee; stand by him, and be his Help; and all this we beg in the Name, and for the sake of Iesus Christ, to whom with thy self, and e|ver blessed Spirit of Grace, enable us to ascribe, as is most due, all Power, Praise, Glory, and sincere obedience, from us and all thine, now, henceforth, and for evermore. Amen.
e dat locum Di|abl. Eph. 4.27Well, I'le detain you no longer, only take this from me, Do not give place to the Devil.







Reader,
Take notice, that this poor young onvert, having taken his leave of this recious Minister, doth in his return omewards meet with a cursed in|rument of the Devil, being one De|as (by name) a sad Apostate, who swades him to throw off Religion, nd to turn Atheist (that is, nothing at ll) of which this ensuing Dialogue ill give a further account.




Demas.
How now, why do you look somelan|holy; no doubt but you have been with ome Phanatick Priest or another, your ountenance is so dreadful.


Paulus
I blame your folly,Accus tuam stu|titiam. for he whom  have been with, let him go under what notion soever, is a holy man, and has been one of great use to me.


Demas.
I sware you talk more like a mad an than any body else,The wick|ed of the World do ccount godly sorrow nothing but madness  distraction I tell ou; if you believe all what they

say, you'll be distracted, if you are not already.


Paulus
Whether I am distracted or no, I matter not, for take notice, I must observe what they say unto me, be|cause it concerns what I am to do for God, and for my own soul,


Demas.
Why, doest thou think there is a God?


Paulus.
Yes, as firmly as I do believe the Sun to be in Firmament on Noon|dayes.


Demas.
None are so impiou~s, and sinfully audacious, as such who have fallen from the truth, wherof they were once Professors.Doest thee: I hope then, before I shall have done with you, to make you of the same opinion as I am.


Paulus.
There are many opi|nions in this world.What opinion (I pray) are you of?


Demas.
What opinion am I of? why I am of such an opinion, as that I can pro|duce

you one, whom I'le affirm to be God, Omnipotent, Omnipresent, Om|iscient, and more just then the God hom you serve; for I shall tell you, I have been of the same opinion with your elf, and have believed on the same God hich you believe, but now I am of an|ther mind, and I question not but that  shall make you of the same also, if you e but ruled by me.


Paulus.
Pray what is he?


Demas
A sober Gentleman.
Mark how the Atheist contradicts imself to call his God a Gentleman, it seems then his God is not a spirit.


Paulus.
Will he do one no hurt?
It is not good to be too inqui|sitive after evil spirits.


Demas
No he will not hurt you; for he is a harmless Gentleman, you may see him if you please.


Paulus
Pray then bring him and let me see him.True is that Adage Nemo le|ditu ni  sciso, No man is hted but by himself.



Demas
A Diabo|lical con|trivementRather than that, I would have you come to my House about ten a Clock to morrow morning, and then we may talk together without any interrup|tion: You know where I live.


Paulus
Well then Ile be sure to come, if I am in health.


Demas
Be sure you do not fail me.


Reader
Now followeth another Conference between Evangelus a Minister of th Gospel, and Paulus the young Con|vert, who endeavours to hinder him from going, but cannot.


Evangelus
So, So, I see I am forc'd to visit you, before you will visit me.


Paulus
Truly (Sir) I can't help it, for I have been so out of order both in soul and body, (since I saw you last) a that I am not fit to keep any body Company



Evangelus
Why did you not send for me all this while?A true Mi|nister is at the Call of any that may want him. if you had, I should have come; for I doubt you have had no company, since I have been with you.


Paulus
Yes Sir, I have had some Company with me.


Evangelus.
What company, (I pray) good com|pany?


Paulus.
Truly,Some evil company are so sub|til, as we cannot mediately finde out what they are. I know not very well, it was a man, but what to make of him, I know not: For he has undertaken to bring me a Gentleman that is as ful|ly God, as he whom I and you serve.


Evangelus.
Oh fie,The Chri|stians God is but one God, Deut. 6.4. why are you so deceived, as to think any such thing? what evil company have you commun'd with, know you not, that there is but one God, and that is our God? what a blasphemous wretch was he that told you, from whence did he come, and where doth he dwell?


Paulus.
His name is Demas,Deceivers are here, and there, and every where. he came out of the Countrey, his place of abode

(for a time) is in the City; and about ten of the Clock this Morning; I am bound by vertue of Promise to come and see him and the Gentleman.


Evangelus.
Holy An|ticipation is allow|ed.Well, although you have promised to come and see him, yet I do intend to prevent you.


Paulus.
Mark the fallacious way of ar|guing from a deceitful heart.No, pray Sir, say not so, for if I should disappoint him, he would then reflect upon us and our Religion, and cause the honour of Christianity to lie at stake, if you are loth to let me go alone, do you then go with me.


Evangelus.
I, nor you, neither shall go; if they will come to us, well and good; but for us to come to them, I do not approve of it; therefore think not of going, though you have promised, remembring the Proverb, Its better somtimes to break a Promise then to keep it.


Paulus.
How if they should come to me af|ter you are gone.



Evangelus
Then send for me;We must have  care of challenge|ing the Devil, left therefore the Devil and I dare to meddle with them, if they come upon our own grounds.
hereby God suffers him to conquer us, what we do in a way of Disputation with must be onely in our own defence.




Reader,
Now take notice, that after the departure of this Minister; these two Deceivers comes unto this sweet Con|vert; One of which proves no other|wise then the Devil, as you shall finde by the sequel of the story.




Demas and Apollyon.
How now,How Iro|nically do they speak. who taught you to break your Promise, did your Priests?


Paulus.
No,Necessitas on habit legem. other busines did intervene, so as yet I could not come according to promise.


Demas.
Well, this is the Gentleman of whom I spoke, and Promised to bring to you.



Paulus
Christians can't but shew themselves civilly to strangers.Is it so, I pray you; Sir, sit down, for you are very welcom.


Apollyon.
The Devil can carry himself as civil and sober as any.I thank you, Sir,


Paulus.
The young Mans Pe|tition unto the Devil for concession, In a matter of special concernment.I did promiss to in|form a friend of mine concerning you: Wh promised to come un|to me, and to make one of our Company.


Demas.
What is he, I pray?


Paulus
He is a Minister of the Gospel.


Demas.
'As there is no room for Gods children here below among the wick|ed, so likewise there shall be no room above in Heaven for the wicked among Gods children. The devil must have a word in.Oh it is no matter fo him, another time we serve as well as now,  moreover, I brought th Gentleman with me, o ly to speak concernin affairs, privately among our selves.


Apollyon.
It will not be convenient to have an besides our selves.



Paulus.
Well,Mitte Di|abolum, let the Devil alone. Sir, what you please.


Apollyon.
Sir,The Devil, makes a bargain with the young man. I understand here, by my friend, that you are under some sore Conflict, wherefore I was desir'd occasionally by our self, and instrumentally by him, .e. Demas, to visit you; and so con|sequentially to administer somthing of omfort unto you, in order to which I must have you to promise me these three several things. First, to deny the God whom now you serve. Secondly, o abstain from the Company which you frequent. Thirdly, to believe what I shall say unto you.


Paulus
To any thing that is reasonable,The Bar|gain is ac|cepted up|on such, and such conditi|ons.  shall yield, especially if you can but move your self to be God, and him whom I serve to be no God, the pro|ation of which I expect through ertue of promiss, made by your friend.


Demas
Well that he can do.



Apollyon.
The Devil is a brag.Yes, and easily too.




Reader,
Note, how Demas doth app himself to Apollyon, prescribing a ter what manner the Conferen shall be carried on with conven|ency.




Demas.
The De|vil must have one to help him.The only Method, as I suppose, carry on this Conference among  selves, is, (Good Sir) by letting hi produce those Arguments, which has so prove a God; and so you to a swer as he brings them, and pray  me how you like it?


Apollyon.
I like it very well; how do yo like it, Sir?


Paulus.
I do like it very well also, provide you will not let the plainness of  Arguments make any thing invalid.


Apollyon.
Well, produce your Arguments co cerning the certainty of a God.



Paulus.
I shall after this manner express myself;The Tri|nity pro|vd from five Con|siderati|ons. And first of all, the Creatures do testify the truth of a Deity, and him whom I serve, in regard that it is he who gaveth being of all things, viz. The beings of the Heavens, and of the Earth, and all things contain|ed therein. Secondly, that kind of Gubernation which is among all Creatures, whether humans, divine or diabolical, does evidence the one supream Government, which is of God. Thirdly, the great impressi|on of a Deity upon the hearts of men, evidenced by the accusations of a guilty conscience; and likewise by that Worship which Heathens do ascribe unto fa se god, which being considered it doth exceedingly de|monstrate that there is a true God, though they be ignorant of him. Fourthly, I do believe there is a od, and that it is him whom I serve, be|cause the Scriptures do directly make an obvious discovery and revelation of him. Fifthly and lastly, I do be|lieve that all what I have said is true, because the Devils in Hell would

tear us in pieces, were it not for the Existence of an Almighty God.


Apollyon.
Well, all this we do not deny:Vengeance will be executed upon the devil one day, for appropria|ting Gods titles unto himself. for wha you have said as yet does prove me as much God as any other, ther|fore you must begin a|gain.


Paulus.
As long as faith is in a soul, so long is the Reve|rence of a Deity conti|nued.Nay, I would not for a thousand of Worlds think any o|therwise, but that there is a true God and he it is whom I serve.


Apollyon.
Nay, but I'le prove to the contrary, and will affirm,The devil is a blas|phemous spirit. that the God whom you now serve, is a diabolical Spirity, and likewise is one whom I shall, in Pro|cess of time, inflict my wrath upon, for his carriage both to me and all man|kinde.


Paulus.
Observe the Com|bate be|tween youth and the devil.Why, is not that God whom I serve, now in Heaven, and surely if so, then he is the true God.



Apollyon.
That is true,The devil is a lying spirit. he is in Heaven, but it is only by usurpation.


Paulus.
Whose Throne is Heaven then?


Apollyon.
It is the Throne of the true God.


Paulus.
Who is the true God?The youth (through igno|rance) familiarizes too much with the devil.


Apollyon.
He who now doth talk with you.Audaci|ous blas|phemy.


Paulus.
How come you to be out of your place then?


Apollyon.
I came out of my place for your sake.


Paulus.
Sir,A doubt|ing soul affects no|thing so much as plainness. I am in great distress, pity me therefore, and do not argue sophisti|cally with me, who am not able at this time to answer you.


Apollyon.
Have a care you do not by me as the woman of Samaria did,Behold the devi|ces of this fallen An|gel, th Lord keep us from him. when I appeared visibly on earth (to the whole world) for the sake of mankind.


Paulus.
O what shall I do?



Apollyon.
Believe in me that you may have life.


Paulus.
Lord have mercy upon me.


Apollyon.
The De|vil can bring Scri|pture for a need.Why do you doubt, I am a Spirit do you not know that God is a Spirit John 4.24.


Paulus.
I do believe God is a Spirit.


Apollyon.
Why do you then contend with m any further, who am so fully God as have declared unto you.


Paulus.
When we are tempted, we should rather say. Get lee behind us, Satan; than to talk with him, and ask him Questions.Did you create the Heavens and th Earth, and all thing contained ther in.


Apollyon.
The Devil is made up with no|thing but lies.Yea, and you too.


Paulus.
Lord have mercy upon me.


Apollyon.
How far does God som|times suffer the Devil to usurp his Prerogative.Nay, him whom thou thinkest to be God, I made.



Paulus.
Pardon me then blessed God) that I have offered to con|end thus with thee;Oh poor young man! my bowels do yearn af|ter thee, and all in thy condition; yet I doubt not, but God will raise thee up again, and shew thee the vanity of thy ways. als by (I pray) my alapert, audacious, nd rustical carriage owards thee; for I see now I am, ike the woman of Samaria, who, through ignorance, ascribed the title of Sir ship unto him that was King over Heaven and Earth, even as I have done towards thee.


Apollyon.
I pardon thee,O Devil pardon thy self. because what thou hast done, has been through ignorance.


Paulus.
Yea (good Lord) that it was.Faith is batter'd.


Apollyon.
Well, time doth call me away,The Devil rehearseth over his bargain, that he might be sure, for he is fearful of his prey. for indeed I have many souls to look after, therefore I must leave you, only desi|ring you to remember those three things once Propos'd; viz. 1. The de|nying of God which once you serv'd.

2. The abstaining from those Mini|sters, which once you frequented. 3. The believing what I have said, and shall furthermore say unto you.


Paulus.
With all my heart, good Lord.


Apollyon.
Farewel ther, to-morrow-morning I'le come and see you again.


Paulus.
Oh, my Lord, go not away so soo from me.


Apollyon.
It matters not, as long as I shall come so quickly unto you again.


Paulus.
Then farewel, my Lord.




Reader
Take notice, that when the Devil had parted from this Youth, Demas the day after comes according to promiss; But Apollyon is not with him; from whence we may gather thus much, It is impossible for the Devil to keep his promiss, in regard that he is the father of lyes and lyers,

The end wherefore Demas came, you will understand by the ensuing dis|course.




Demas.
How do you, my friend?


Paulus.
As well as any damned creature can do, but where is my Lord.


Demas.
He could not come through excessive want of him at another place;Observe this plain contradiction; for if he was God, then he could not have been hindred; moreover, this denies the Omnipresence of God, as well as his Omnipotence. but why doest thou say, thou art damned, for if so, then thou art irrecoverable; which if thou wert, Apollyon would not un|dertake to do any thing for you, neither should I have brought him to you.


Paulus
I believe you good Sir,Here is Thanks|giving without occasion, and a blessing of the devil instea of God. Te trying of no way conscientious, is the cause of may tha comes to be nothing. and there|fore do desire to bless God for you, because you brought me acquainted with him.


Demas.
Alas, I have tried all ways, but could finde no rest, till I met with him, and so it will be with thee.



Paulus
Ha, how may one be deceived; for I thought that I was in the right way, and worship'd the true God, but it seemes it is otherwise, do you think therefore your God will receive me, after I have been serving a strange God?


Demas.
The devil and his compani|ons are all one. A cursed inquiti|on.Yes, yes, I'le warrant that.


Paulus
When will he come to me then?


Demas.
Tomorrow morning precisely, at five of the Clock; I came therefore, as desired by him, to inform you of it, and likewise from my self to advise you of several things.


Paulus
Speak on, and well come.


Demas.
We are apt many times to welcom that, which in the clse, condu|ceth to cur ruine.First, be sure you do remember and er in minde what Apollyon said un|to you last; Now that which I have from my self unto you is this, Whatso|ever my Lord shall require of you, con|descend unto it immediately; therefore if he should require your self, give up

your self unto him by a free Resignati|on of spirit, withut any doubting, for if you should in the juncture of time that he requires any thing of you, seem to refuse, he then departs from you to|tally and finally; This I know, be|cause, through fear, I had like to have given him occasion my self; and hence it is that I caution you.


Paulus
The Lord your Master treble it in|to your bosome, for what you have done unto me.


Demas.
Nay, my Work is wages.


Paulus
I Question not but it is.


Demas.
Well, I must bid you adieu.


Paulus
And you also, but be sure yo bring my Lord with you.


Demas.
Don't question that.


Reader
When this young Convert had de|parted

from his two supposed friends and from one especially, he walks a|broad, and in his return homewards, finds a letter directed unto him by that Choice Minister of Jesus Christ, from whom he had abstein'd so long, and by whom he could not be found, through obligation unto a Promise. The Letter is as followeth.


To the Beloved of my Soul T.P.
My Son,
FOR so I may call thee, because in the Lord Iesus I begot thee, in whose Name I command attention unto the affectionate Exhortations of your di|stressed father, who through thy diso|bedience unto God, has almost brought his hoary head with sorrow unto the Grave: and for which cause I have made my tears my meat and drink, day and night, ever since I saw thee last. Ah Child, thou art gone, which vexe

me sore; but the consideration of thy being gone from God, vexes me sorest of all; how happy wouldest thou make me, if I could but see thy face before I go from hence, and be seen no more: I long to understand thy Conflicts, as once I did, that I might thereby ad|minister something of comfort and advice, in a more sympathizing and condoling manner then ever. The thoughts of thy groans pierces me to the heart; but the thoughts of thy trials and temptations doth so oppress my spirits, as that I know not what to do; Art thou not therefore blame|worthy, to carry thy self in such an occult and secret manner as thou doest; fall down, I beseech you, through the sense thereof; think not of being freed from Satan, while thou art such a friend unto him in keeping of his coun|sel. The Devil is a subtile enemy, ad|here not to him, believe him no, and give no credit unto any of his suggesti|ons; to be ruined is sad, but to be instrumental to thy own ru|ine is more sad: Something of the Devils wiles thoa hast already sn:

O therefore, let such an Experiment anticipate all his other designes from having effect; keep off from him, have nothing to do with him; for there is nothing but malice and evil in all his designes: I hear, you make a strict Inquisition after Satan, I pray where|fore is it? Have you a minde to lose your soul? Are you in love with your own damnation? Is the loss of Hea|ven, and the Enjoyment of God no|thing? Will the Devil ve a better friend to you then God? Will the Flames of Hell be as sweet as a Bed of Roses? Will weeping in the Labyrinth of eternal misery, be more pleasant then the singing Halllujahs in the glorious Heavens? which is best to be chosen, misery, or felicity, Iudg you; which would you chuse, to sit at Gods right Hand, or his Left; why I tell you, if you combine with the Devil, you will then take Gods gretest Enemies part, and thereby will lose all those perpetual, heavenly and celestial Ioys, Promised and Prepared for Gods Elect.
If thou believest and know what hea|ven is, live then as one that knows the

same. Oh, go to the throne of grace, and leave it not, till thou doest find the grace of God and the Oyl of Consolati|on Pour'd into thy heart, and for the order of your appearing unto God, de|mean your self as the Prodigall, Luke 15. Cry as David, Psalm. 38.18. For I will declare my Iniquities, and will be sorry for my sins; how thy state now is, I know not, and therefore after what maner to write to thee I know not, I do believe your case is dreadfull, by the oppression of my own spirlt, and your being so long absent from me, and whe|ther now this may come to you I cannot tell, therefore I shall desist from wri|ting so amply as I would.
Aug. 16. 1672.
Your Father in the Lord Jesus W. W.

The young Man having received this Letter, reades it; and ha|ving read it, he considers up|on it, and at last is affected exceed|ingly therewith; but these two De|ceivers coming unto him again, doth through their vain discourse and diabolical concernment, make this Youth to yield unto them, so as that he forgets the Letter (which came from his dear friend) in which was conteined such wholesom, seasonable and compassionate Instructions.

Demas and Apollyon.
So, what now, I hope you have not transgress'd.


Paulus
Not I indeed.


Apollyon.
How then comes it to pass you look so sad?


Paulus
I have by an unparalleld providence, received a letter from one who lov'd me, which is strange in regard that he knew not where I dwelt.


Apollyon.
The Devil proves there is no Providence by a Lie and corrects the young man for his illiteratness.Sha, Providence; there's not such things

as that; for those things which you call Providence, are only things which falls out by chance; and you also talk illiterately and foolishly, to say that was unparallel'd, because such as this has bin common ere now.


Paulus
Nay, I do not know, but none shall make me to believe any otherwise but that it was Miraculous, if it will not hold with being unparallel'd.


Demas.
Pray let me speak a word in your ear.There are the whispe|rings of an evil spirit, us well as a good.


Paulus.
With all my heart, Good Sir.


Demas.
Pray now, have a care of carrying your self foolishly, left thereby you oc|casion him to depart, as I told you once before.


Paulus
Well I will.


Apollyon.
How are you compos'd in minde?


Paulus
Not very well, My Lord.







Apollyon
Behold the Devi.How can you call me Lord? and ad|joyn such an epthite (as my) thereto, whereas you have not given up your self unto me.


Paulus
Will you accept of me, Oh Lord?


Apollyon
If I had meant otherwise, I should not have ask' you.


Paulus
The young Man speaks to the Devil after the Language of Canaan, which ouht to be used with God only.Lord I am at your ser|vice, do with me as seems good in thy sight.


Apollyon
Has that God which you serv'd, been good to you?


Paulus
Hard thoughts of God are the fruits of Atheism When th soul has hard thoughts of God, the Devil will do what he can to mul|tiply themTruly I must needs say this, that though I had many things of the o|ther od whom I serv'd yet he would not give me all as I desir'd.


Apollyon
That I believe, and shall I tell you those many things which you had of him were not so reall as they were Pre|sented to you, being only shadows.



Paulus
It's likely so truely.The young man now accords with the Devil in everything A time appointed for the Contract.


Apollyon
Well if you are willing (as you say) to be my Servant, meet me about five of of the Clock at night, by the place where we use to meet, and bring with you your Penknise, Paper, and Pen, this is all, only be sure to meet me without fail, or else be it to your own peril.


Paulus
I'le be sure not to fail you.


Apollyon
Till then farewell.




Reader
Thus thou seest how this poor Con|vert is tossed up and down through the wiles and Machinations of Satan, how Sollicitous have been the vety powers of Hll, to destroy the soul of this young man, how have they Com|bin'd together for the making of their stratagems effectual. For once he went with an intent to meet the Devil, and as he was entring into the appointed place, the Spirit of God in|terrupted

him by setting home this Scripture, with such power, Mat. 16.26. For what is a man profited, if he should gain the whole world, and lose his own soul; At that he was forc'd to return home again, and ask God for pardon, and yet nevertheless Corruption being very prevalent and the Devil mighty busie, he was there|by impuls'd to make another attempt in the like manner, who accordingly did, as you may understand by what shall follow.




Apollyon.
The Devils salutationWell met (my Paulus) why does thou muse with thy self?


Paulus
The young man is daunted.I am at a stand, and know not what to do.


Apollyon.
An Inter|rogation.At a stand, why so?


Paulus
He reasons with the Devil.You know (O Lord) the business which we are met about, and the weightiness thereof, therfore I hope, reason will shew why I look so.



Apollyon.
Friend,The Devil knows how to suit himsIf, according to the constitutions of People.
The Devil makes many times, as if he was but indifferent, in those things which he is most earnest and desirous of. As for my part, it matters not, whether or no you con|sent to what I require; it was for your happi|ness that I requir'd this from you; but to con|clude, take notice, that I will not be made a fool by such an one as you; Go there|fore to your other God, and see what e can do for you, for I scorn to re|ceive you.


Paulus.
Good Lord, fret not your self so, for I am not going away from you, only I desire deliberation, suiting with a work of so great a concern|ment as this.


Apollyon.
Nay,The devil is an an+gry spirit. call not me Lord, except you were my servant; and as for your de|liberation, you have had time enough already.


Paulus.
Ha,We are apt many ties to consider when it is too late. but I never did deliberate upon it till now.



Apollyon.
The Devil knows so well the advantage of consideration, as that if he should give way to it, he knows it would dash all his designes to pieces.If so be you could not deliberate, when you had time enough, expect it not now.


Paulus.
Well, if so, you will not give me leave to satisfie my self herein; I know not what to say to you.


Apollyon.
You know not what to say to me, say somthing or nothing; and if in this you be not satisfied, a Fig for you.


Paulus.
Be not angry, I pray.


Apollyon.
Here is cause to be angry, when you deal thus with me,Blahe|my. who am so fully God. Consider the aggravation that does attend it, therefore in this one mi|nute resolve me, either in the negative or affirmative.


Paulus.
What would you have me to do?



Apollyon
Only this,The Au|thor dares not write here what he did write, lest it should prove a tentation. Put Pn to Paper and write thus.


Paulus.
Well,Note, thus far he went, and further he had gone, if divine Grace had not restrain'd him. I will write thus, (For)


Apollyon.
Proceed,The de|vils Ad|vice to the yong man Divine Provi|dence in|terrupts. The devil claims him be|fore he is his. why stay you your hand?


Paulus.
I know not what the matter is, for I cannot move my hand.


Apollyon.
You had as good go on now, seeing that you have written the first word, viz. (For) for you are mine by what you have done already.


Paulus.
I defie you as yet,The young man defies the devil. for I know what I have done.


Apollyon.
A Nuncupti Well is as good as a written one,A devil|ish machi|nation it was, that which had almost prevailed upon the young man, in making of him to yield, by putting Pen to Paper, of which further ob|serve. so that what you have not done by Pen you have done by word of Mouth, and therefore it is all one.





Observ. I.
The young man supposing him, with whom he had conferr'd so long, to be the Devil, breaks forth into these breathings of spirit (unto the true God whom once he serv'd) viz. Now, now, now, O precious Saviour, give me somthing for my faith to act upon, by making of thy self unto me  present help in the time of need, and for the future try me.


Observ. II.
The Devil perceiving such sweet Motions to be upon the heart of the young man, and being destitute of all hopes in having him as his prey; doth by the Authority of God va|nish and leave him for a time.


Observ. III.
This young man, as he was walk|ing up and down, did experience more and more, that he with whom he conspir'd against his God, was the

Devil, which caus'd him to cry out thus, O wretched man as I am, that I should go so far with the wicked one; how shall I escape damnation, whenas I have thus transgress'd.


Observ. IV.
This young man wondring at him self, did meditate upon several things; and as he was reading one place of Scripture, alluded to in a book, entituled, (The Sinners San|ctuary) being, Hebr. 10.23. Let us hold fast the Profession of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that promised. The Devil assaults him again, and appears in the shape of a white Spaniel dog, with a Letter in his Mouth, saying unto him, Thou  not Elected; at which the young man rises up, and speaks to God as follows.
And I thought thou didst give unto at some token of love and mercy; but ow I am afraid that I was deceived, and therefore if the manifestation which then I had was not right, skew it (I pray thee) unto thy servant;

but if right, then be pleased to back it with another as Powerful as before, through the efficacy of some Scripture, co-essential with it, which the Lor accordingly did in the very junctur of time; and bringing also with th same a Scripture essential thereto, viz Hos. 11.3. From whence he gathere That the truth of Election did not con|sist in a bare knowledge thereof, bu that Election might be where no ap|pearance thereof could be foun The Youth now travelling homeward doth in his way meet with a great ma stiffe Dog, running round about him and catching hold on the left latchets o of his shooes, doth vanish. And b ing return'd safe home, he meets wit the holy Minister who was so much concern'd with him, and the discours be tween these two, it as flloweth.




Evangelus
Oh, My Lamb! Where hast tho been all this while? For it rejoyceth my soul to see thee once more.


Paulus
Oh, but you have no cause to be glad in seeing me at this time, and i such a condition.



Evangelus.
Why talkest thou thus (My Child) as now thou doest, tell me therefore to case my oppressed soul, where thou hast been, and what is the matter with thee?


Paulus.
I have been where I have seen a man that did come out of the Air,The young man talks light|headed, through the exces|sive ten ptons of the de|vil. The dan|ger of shunning good Councel. yea, where I know not my self I have been.


Evangelus.
Obstinacy against good Councel doth always bring forth evil effects; for now have I prayed with thee, wept over thee, and given thee good Coun|cel, but by none of these could I pre|vail, for fighting and rejecting of which thou art brought into un|speakable misery.


Paulus.
I am sensible of this,He de|spairs. but here lies my misery, it is too late.


Evangelus.
Do not say so, as long as we have a day in which we may work.


Paulus.
Did I belong to God, I should re|ceive somthing of comfort from what

you say, but you know not my con|dition, in vain therefore it is to take pains with such an one as I.


Evangelus.
Why not take pains with you now I have done so once, and God has blest it; and I question not but he will d the like now.


Paulus.
It is the sin of young Converts, to condemn and censure every thing, which seems not at the first view right.I believe nothing is too hard for God, and I know that he can save my soul, but I am sure he will not.


Evangelus.
The misery of this young man contributes anxiety to the Minister.My Cd, it pricks me to the heart, in hearing such blasphemy proceed from thee; certainly an evil spirit has bin busie with thee.


Paulus.
An ambi|guous speech.Busie, yea, and more busie will he be.


Evangelus.
Child, I am thy friend, thou know|est it; do not therefore put me off with such Riddles, AEnigmaes, Allegories, and dark kinde of speeches as these are

 I do not affect them, especially from han one as your self.


Paulus.
I am afraid the devil has bin too d for me.The grounds of fear.


Evangelus.
Wherein, my Lamb!


Paulus.
The last time that you was with  (you may remember) you en|ir'd of me, what company I had?  which I reply'd, A man that I ew not very well.


Evangelus.
What, that irrenious fellow?


Paulus.
Yea, that fellow.


Evangelus.
But I hope, you have not seen him, the Gentleman which you spoke of, ce that time.


Paulus.
Yes, but I have to my sorrow, I nsure.


Evangelus.
I am afraid so too,The Mi|nisters sus|picion. what did you do hen you were together?



Paulus
To rehearse I dare not, to con I am ond.


Evangelus.
The Mi|nister seks aer an interpre|tation of the young M is Pro|verb.What means this (To reveal I  not, to conceal I am bound) who i that you are so oblig'd to, as that dare not disoblige? none but surely.


Paulus
I wish it was so.


vangelus.
Dally not with me, if it is to contrary, tell me so.


Paulus
He e|clare this Aostey.Loth I am to tell you, beca was once a Christian, or at least in pretence, once I did own Christians God. But who do think is my God now?


Evangelus.
The Mi|nisters belief 'of the youth.Him, I hope, besides whom properly can be said to be God.


Paulus
Is not the Devil God?


Evangelus.
In what respect the devil is God.Yea, catachrstically and impro he is so called, but (I hope) 

him whom thou hast chosen.


Paulus.
What he is,The dev can trans+form him self into many shapes. I know not, but he es in the habit of a Gentleman.


Evangelus.
What is it the Gentleman which you  me of just now.


Paulus.
Yea, that is him whom I have own| to be God.


Evangelus.
How! Renounce it for the sake of our soul, I charge you.


Paulus.
It has bin past renouncing long go.


Evangelus.
God forbid, I would not have it so orten thousand worlds.


Paulus.
It is so confirm'd, as that ten thou|sand and ten thousand can't revoke it.


Evangelus.
What hast thou done then?


Paulus.
I have given my soul to him.


Evangelus.
Did he require it of thee, and hast thou done it?
The young man did go very near in contracting with the Devil, but he did totally contract with him, as you will find in fine. Yes, yes, yes.


Evangelus.
 Dost thou know what thou h done?


Paulus.
I think so, why what is the mater?


Evangelus.
What is the matter? thou hast  Gods greatest enemies part.


Paulus.
Who is that, I pray?


Evangelus.
Satan, which is call'd the Devil.


Paulus.
The young man prays for a de|precation of his misery. Behold how his misery is augment|ed by many gra|dations.The Lord forbid.


Evangelus.
Nay, it is so, and Christ have mer|cy on thee; from a Christian thou ar become a Wizard; and so consequen|tially thou art ripened for Hell, a much as once I thought thou wert for Heaven; thy condition is such, as i renders thee incapable of the love of

God; so that now he hates you, his Children hates you, your Relation hates you; and, adieu, my friend, adieu.


Paulus
Attend (Good Sir) and do not you who has been alwayes my friend leave me now in my greatest perplex|ity. Examine me a little, before you give me over quite, and let the time before encourage you hereun|to.


Evangelus.
I wish you were but more sensible; when I saw you first, you seem'd to be somwhat penitent; but I am afraid now God has stricken thee with a judi|cial hardness and blindness.

Note, in this Discourse comes De|mas, who interrupts, and speaks as followeth.

Demas.
I wonder, Sir, you would urge him to renounce that which he hath seal'd to by his own blood, and calling God as a witness to the same.



Paulus.
O stop thy mouth; false thou hast been to me, for as to paper, yea, and also blood, I do deny, and therefore say no such word.


Evangelus.
Is this he (my Child) whom thou call'st Demas; if so then, that thou didst not enter into any combination with him and his Comrague the Devil by blood, return Praise to God, and matter not what they say: And wher|fore dost thou (O Demas,) impute that to my Lamb, which he was never guil|ty of?


Demas.
Pray who be you, that you rage so much at me, as if I was engaged to the Devil, and as if I was the cause of troubling your friend; both of which I deny, and pray speak no more but what you can prove.


Evangelus.
Thou art a Liar, being like the De|vil thy father; for we fear not thee nor any of thine, and it shall be prov'd that thou wert the great Instrument, which the Devil made use of to destroy my Child; but the God whom we

serve has deceived thee, Glory be as|crib'd unto him for ever.


Demas.
Know you friend, I will not be th taunted at by you; and did I b bring the God whom I serve, yo would tremble, meerly through a fight of him.


Evangelus.
We care not for you, nor your God; and if you should bring him hither, we would not stir out of our Places.


Demas.
I shall ere long make trial of that, and until then, farewell.


Evangelus.
And farewel yu.


Paulus.
How glad am I that he is gone.


Evangelus.
Ha Child,An Exhor|tation to Thanks|giving. walk as long as you live in the sense of this mercy, of agracious God unto you, in restreining you from doing what you was tempted to; And now for the glory of this God, I do de|sire you to make a brief Confession of your being first acquained with this Person,Motives to Con|fession and so with the Devil, and

what it was he required of you, tha these things may be left as a Narrative of Gods dealings with you unt succeeding Generations.




The CONFESSION of PAVLVS
When I first began to be trou|bled, this Person (Demas) being a ancient Acquaintance of mine, wh at first seem'd mighty zealous in the ways of Godliness, did of late visit me very often, and perceiving of m to be somwhat unsatisfied, he de|manded the Reasons thereof; and a last understanding somthing of it, he told me that he had experienc'd the God whom I serv'd, not to be the true God, producing substantial Reasons (as I thought) for the proof thereof, which winn'd so up|on me, and being likewise perceiv'd by him, it did make him somwhat prevalent with me, to grant leave that he might bring the Gentleman unto me, (i.e. Devil) which being granted, and concealing it from you,

together with many temptatious that attended me. I did meet him at a certain time and place appointed, and so in process of time he got me to de|ny these three things. 1. To deny the God whom I serv'd.Observe the evil effcts that do ensue the con|cealing of suggestions. 2. To abstain from the Mini|sters I frequented. 3. To believe whatsoever be should say unto me; which after these were granted, he then made me to promise my soul unto him, in form as aforesaid, ( ) and as soon as I had set Pen to paper; and writ this word (For) I could not go any further, which being perceiv|ed by him, he cursed me, and withal told me, that if I did not write, it was all one, and I was his, as long as I had set Pen to Paper; only this he added, If I would write all, then he would be more merciful unto me at the expiration of my time; but if I did not, he then would use me o much the more cruel; the saying of which does at this present time trouble my soul very much  hink|ing that I am his: And therefore, I

pray Sir, what think you of it?




Evangelus.
Child, that was only a temptation fram'd by himself, to draw you aside  set Pen to Paper.


Paulus.
Say you so, but what shall I  then with your God, which I on worshipped, he, I suppose, will b never recounted unto me, because have disowned him and all his Com|mandments.


Evangelus.
Truly (my Child) if so be it is a things are Presented to me, I mus needs say then, If your Head was  fountain of tears, and your Hands streams thereof, you could not suffici|ently mourn for what you have done; and moreover, if God had damn'd you longere this had been committed, he would have been justified therein, but much more now, when you are guilty of that which I thought you would never have been guilty of. Nevertheless, from hence gather Hope, viz. Gods restraining of you to do what was in|tended, it being an infallible sign that

God is willing to save thee.


Paulus.
O that I had but assurance of it.


Evangelus.
Nay, (no doubt) it may be a long time before God will give you an assu|rance of his love, in regard that you have by exceeding Provocations for|feited it.


Paulus.
Ha, but I am one, that can never be at peace, unless God doth imme|diately tell me that all my sins are forgiven, nay, I am afraid I shall kill my self, if God does not cast some fa|vourable aspect upon me.


Evangelus.
How do you talk! have you not pro|voked God enough already, and will you provoke him still? have a care lest you do thereby augment your misery.


Paulus.
Alas, I am damn'd, I am damn'd, do not then blame me for speak|ing so.


Evangelus.
I must needs confess your case is de|sperate; but yet notwithstanding this,

if you will go to God in his own way, you may find mercy.


Paulus
I have (without doubt) commit|ed the sin against the holy Ghost, in regard of those several aggravations which do attend my Sins, for did you ever hear of any sav'd, who sin'd af|ter their Baptism, and acknowledg|ment of the truth.


Evangelus.
Nam multa possunt ostendi veteris  Novi Testamenti exempla ubi lapsi remissionem pecca|torum  absolutionem  Christo  Ecclesia sunt consecuti, viz. David, Manasse, Petrus, lapsa est Galatarum Ecclesia,   Paulo ad poenitentiam revocata:  Paulus ipse Corinthium incestum ju|bt recepi post poeni ten|tiam. Aug.
The young mans sins of omission and commission.Yea, surely, for what think you of Da|vid, Manasse, Peter, and the Church of the Galatians, when cal|led in by Paul to re|pentance.


Paulus
If I had but access to the Throne of grace, it would be something, but I have been for a year and an half (through sin) debarr'd there from, how think you therefore that I can go without Blushing.



Evangelus.
If thou wouldest have God to take any notice of thee, thou must go to the Throne of grace in great shame and confusion.


Paulus
What if I can't lift up so much as my eyes unto him.He cannot lift up his eyes to God.


Evangelus.
Yes,Luke 16. for have you not read of the Publicans demeanour before God?


Paulus
This is true, and therefore my dear friend, I am much oblidg'd to you, for all your love and pains with me, and if you will be pleas'd to tell me what I must do when I come home, I shall thereby be ingaged more than ever.


Evangelus.
First,Heb. 7.25 Ezek. 33.11. Psal. 32.5. Psa. 38.18 believe that God is still able and willing to save thee.
Secondly, confess thy iniquities, be sorry for them, and then ask forgive|ness,

with a firm resolution in the strength of Christ, to do so no more.
Thirdly, by the greatness of thy sins plead for a Pardon from God.
Fourthly, make Christ the Way to the Father, excluding altogether your own works and righteousness, from justification and salvation.Joh. 14.6. Mat. 26.41. 1 Thes. 5.17. Phil. 4.11 1 Tim 6.8 Eph. 4.27. Jam. 47.
Fifthly, omit no duty for your life.
Sixthly, endeavour to be content in all states and conditions.
Seventhly, be not a friend io the Devil, by concealing any of his Sug|gestions.
Eph. 4.27. 2 Co. 11.2.Eighthly, tempt not the devil.
Ninthly. For the future live with a more holy jealousie then ver.


Paulus
This together with what you have formerly done for me, I shall remem|ber (I hope) as long as I live.


Evangelus.
Nay, many things I have to say,

but you cannot hear them now I shall therefore reserve them till another opportunity that you and I may have; but in the mean time, the God of Heaven bless you, and so farewel.

FINIS.





Courteous Reader,
Which Title thou shalt well deserve, if thou wilt but excuse the Author from such Er|rata's as have escaped the Press, being very many and great, his distance from the City not giving him the opportunity to peruse the sheets as they were done, the most material whereof are here subjoyn'd, and do beg the coverture of thy candid censure.



ERRATA in the Epistle Dedicatory.
Line 31 read not of any of you, line 177 leave out and. line 218. read but Iesus Christ who will plead.


Errata in the Book.

An Advertisement to the READER.
REader, Thou art desired to take Notice, that by Evangelus (one of the Interlocutors) is signified a holy Man and Minister, who often con|versed with the Author when he was in his deplorable condition. By Paulus, the Author himself, considered in his unconverted and converted estate, to|gether with his Conflict. By Demas, an Apostate and Atheist, who was in|strumental to the bringing of the Au|thor to his sad condition. And by A|pollyon is signified the Devil him|self, who often appeared visibly, design|ing thereby the Authors destruction.
