To the READER.
_VOuchsafe, good Rea|der,
in a word or two
to vnderstand the oc|casion
of bringing this
MEDITATION to the
Presse, that was pur|posed
onely for the Pulpit: the rather
for that it commeth not from the Au|thors
owne hand, who would no doubt
more exactly haue polished it, could
hee haue beene perswaded to publish
it himselfe. But hee, out of his mode|stie
(as hee deliuered it, not like a

Scholler his Lesson learned without
Booke, nor brought with him any
intent to haue it further made pub|lie,
so) could not be induced (though
instantly laboured both by my selfe
and many others, desiring further
fruit of so learned and religious 
Labour) eyther to publish it himselfe,
or to haue any hand at all in the pub|lishing
of it.
Howbeit at length, vpon extreame
importunitie (rather to preuent the
wrong that by imperfect Copies prin|ted
he might otherwise sustaine, then
to satisfie such as were earnest sutors
to him for the same) hee was with
much adoe drawne before his depar|ture
from the Citie, to deliuer his
Notes to a friend, (with reference of
the whole businesse, to the iudgement
and discretion of others, to deale in,
and dispose of as they should deeme
sit,) who being present at the speaking
of it, with the Authors Notes, and

his owne helpes, hath done his endea|uour
to penne it as neare as he could,
to that which by the Author himselfe
was then deliuered. Which though it
be not altogether verbatim the same,
yet it is hoped that there is not any
thing materiall wanting, that the di|ligent
hearer shall desire: besides that
hee shall finde some things ouer and
aboue, that straits of Time, and default
of Memory were then a meanes to
keepe backe.
If any aske, what needed such im|portunitie
in this businesse, there be|ing
already so many Sermons abroad,
that euen Printers themselues com|plaine,
that the Presse is oppressed
with them? I answere: True it is,
that there are Sermons indeede a|broad
by some more then enough;
but yet not enough (I dare say it)
such as this is, that deale so pitily,
so effectually, in points of practise
so necessary, so ordinary, as this

doth; wherein Learning and Pie|tie,
delightfull manner of handling,
together with profitable and vsefull
matter, so concurre, that if it please
not any, they are those alone, whose
prophane palates can relish nothing
that sauoureth of grace, though ne|er
so delightfull otherwise: if it
profit not any, it is to be feared
they are such, whose corrupt Con|sciences
are growne wel-neare irre|couerable,
if not wholy incurable.
But I am loth to be long, where
the worke it selfe is not. This lit|tle
be spoken rather in way of A|pologie
for my selfe and such others
as vrged the publishing of it, then
in commendation of the Worke, which
in the very reading of it, to any iu|dicious,
ingenious, and religious,
will sufficiently commend it selfe.
For my selfe, considering the gene|rall
approbation giuen it by all sorts
that heard it, together with the ear|nest

suites of many others, so intant|ly
desiring it vpon their reports,
and finding vpon view and serueigh
the thing it selfe fully to answere
both the reports of the one, and the
desires of the other, I was right
willing and ready (as hee speaketh
in Plato) though one barren hither|to
in this kinde my selfe,Socrates apud Plat. in Theaet. to performe
some Midwiue-like office to another,
for the further enlargement of so
generally blessed, and so deseruedly
desired a birth. Wherein if thou shalt
chance to finde any defects, consider
ut (I pray thee) how hard a thing
it is for another (though not vn|skilfull)
to perfect a worke that some
curious Artist hath left vnfinished.
And so wishing onely, that it may
through Gods gracious assistance, ey|ther
worke into, or increase in thee
a good Conscience, and the comfort
thereof; I leaue the Worke to thy per|vsall,
and it to his blessing, whose

gift a good Conscience is, and with
whom, beside the present comfort of
it heere, is a plentifull reward reser|ued
for it else-where.
Thine in Christ,
THOMAS GATARE.





Balme from Gilead,
TO
Recouer Conscience.

HEBR. 13. 18.
For wee are assured, that wee
haue a good Conscience, desiring
in all things to walke honestly.

_I Will vse no other Pre|face,
but the short one
before my Text; and
that not as a Preface,
but in way of earnest suite, Pray
for mee: For I desire this day, in
treating of a GOOD CONSCIENCE,
both so my selfe to keepe and dis|charge
one, and so to speake home
to yours, that the dead Consciences

may heare the voyce of God in my
Text,  be quickened, the secure
ones awakened, the troubled ones
comforted, the tender confirmed,
the good bettered, and all receiue
some light and life: that wee may
all depart hence in the peace of a
Good conscience, assured (with our
Apostle) that we haue a good one, de|siring
in all things to walke honestly.
This worke, God witnessing to
my Conscience, I much desire to
doe; and in so doing, I know I
desire a worthy worke: A worke
so highly and peculiarly needfull
for these times, that a sharpe Seer
of them, was often heard to pray,
that God would stirre vp some to
write and preach of this Argu|ment:
and another to Augustines
wish, That hee might heare Paul
preach, addeth his owne; That the
Text and Theame might be CON|SCIENCE:
they both saw it gas|ping,
drawing on, and dying; and

therefore desired that some life
might be put into and kept in it,
before it should be vtterly ouer|whelmed
in death and darknesse.
The time indeede was, in the
beginning of Time, when Adam
by his first Sinne brought death
vpon his Soule, and caused it to
raigne ouer all the powers of it,
that this Facultie had most life left
in it, like Iobs Messengers, to tell
newes of the great losse.Scintilla reliq. rect ratis. Lips. This lit|tle
sparke was left fresh, to shew
what great light had beene extin|guisht;
but now this also through
affected blindnesse and wilfull ma|lice,
is so smoothered and suffoca|ted,
through a daily custome of
sinning, the eyes of it so pecked
out, the mouth so stopped, the
very heart of it so wounded and
quelled, that (as the world iust|ly
complaynes) it is dead long
since; yea, long since buryed in
the graue of habituall sinning,

with the stone of hardnesse rou|led
vpon it; that, as Mary said of
Lazarus, the very name of it is
growne vnsauoury, odious, and
I feare ridiculous in the eares of
many. Is it not then high time
for the Lord to worke? and for vs
to see if by crying aloud (as Elias
said of the dead Idoll) wee may
fetch life againe into it, which
is the very life of our spirituall
life, and soule of our soule?
 The time is now come vpon vs,
wherein men affect and desire
good Names, Estates, Wiues,
Houses, good Cloathes, good eue|ry
thing; but content themselues
with meane and vile Consciences,
which ought to be the chiefe and
onely good: Wherein men loue
to exercise and shew, in Preach|ing,
in Hearing, in Trading, and
all manner of conuersing, their
Memorie, their skill and cunning,
and al other their good parts, as they

call them, neglecting this which
is the WHOLE of a Man; and
despising Pauls Exercise, and Pauls
Policie,Acts 24. 16. and 33. To haue a good Conscience
before God and Man: Wherein
men loue preaching indeede and
knowledge, but not wholsome do|ctrine;
Preaching to the Consci|ence
and knowledge of them|selues,
which makes this Pulpit
and Church-yard full of Polemi|call
and Schoole-diuinitie; while
the plaine, practicall, and asketi|call
part lyeth vntilled and vnre|garded:
which maketh Citie and
Country full of Craft and Cun|ning,
but voyd and destitute, not
onely of the power but shew of
Conscience. All which maketh
me to chuse rather with the Apo|stle
to speake fiue words to the
Heart,1 Cor. 14. then tenne thousand to
the Eare; yea, one to shew you a
good Conscience, then ten thou|sand
to shew all the Science in the

world. Sermon you heare vpon
Sermon, till this Mannacomes
out at your nostrils: but as oe
said of Lawes; one is yet wanting
for the practising of all the rest.
Now Conscience is the spring of
Practise, and the Wheele that
must set all the rest on going: Is
it not high time to speake to Con|science,
that wee be no longer
hearers onely, but dooers also?
 The time is now approaching,
as wee may easily discerne, if wee
haue not drunke or slept out our
eyes, as in the times of Noah, in
which Christ is powring out his
Viols vpon the earth: and shortly,
wherein the Bookes shall be ope|ned,
these clasped and sealed
Bookes of our Consciences, the
Contents whereof are now like
Letters written with the Iuyce of
Orrenges, that cannot be read till
it come to that fire which shall
make the secrets of all hearts legi|ble;

yea, euery the least Fraction,
euen the least idle thought or
speech: all which are faithfully re|gistred
in them? Is it not then
high time to looke into these
Bookes, to cast vp these Bookes;
yea, to be well skilled and versed in
them, for the sake and rectifying
whereof all other good Bookes are
written, that we might be able to
proe and examine our selues, whe|ther
vpon good ground wee can
say with our Apostle; We are assu|red
we haue a good Conscience? c.
Which Text when I reade and
pronounce, which I doe that you
may well vnderstand, mee thinkes
 heare Pauls voyce, and discerne
is Spirit, as the Mayd knew Pe|ers
voyce. I heare him vse the
ike appeale in the very like case,
when the Hebrewes accused him,
and Ananias bad smite him on the
outh; I haue in all good Conscience
serued God to this day.

In the selfe-sam case, when they
hyred Tertullus to paint him 
with his Rhetoricke for a pesti|lent
fellow, a troubler and com|motioner
of the whole world, he
vsed the like prouocation; I en|deauour
alwaies to haue a good Con|science
towards God and man. The
very like protestation against the
surmises of the same Hebrews, 
9. Yea, so often, that 2 Cor. 1. 12. 
cals this, and claimes it as his owne
glory: This is my boasting, a 
Conscience. So that as we discerne
Ships by their Flags; so may wee
Paul by this flagge of comfort and
defiance, which he hangs out al|most
in euery Epistle; and if wee
may guesse at the whole cloath by
the List, this Epistle, as this Tri|umph,
is his: And worthily indeed
becomes it this chosen vessell, to
glory in this choise Iewell, with
which the whole world compa|red
and weighed in the Ballance,

will be found as light as drosse
and vanity, and without this, Losse,
Dung, and vexation of Spirit.
For mine owne part, when I view
this triumph, and the Apostle so
frequently and so confidently v|sing
it; I professe my selfe deepely
affected therewithall. The world
hath many stately sights, glorious
obiects, as namely strong Towers,
tall Ships vnder saile, Armies vn|der
Banners, sumptuous Buildings,
pleasant Orchards and Gros:
but when I represent to my selfe,
when I seriously conceiue and con|sider
Paul, riding in this trium|phant
Chariot, aduanced aboue
the reach of mens thoughts and
tongues, yea aboue all sublunarie
changes, all the fore-mentioned
are in mine eies, but stately bables,
pompous fantasies, painted Pa|geants.
Did Paul in the fruition of
this, enuie Agrippa's golden chaine?
No: It was but for manners sake

Paul excepted his Chaine. And he
that hath this good, needes not en|uie,
I say, not any greatnesse here
present: No not Nebuchadnezzers
stalking in his magnificent Galle|ries,
built for his honour: The great
Turke garded with his Ianizaries:
The triple-crowned man of pride
riding vpon mens shoulders, and
treading vpon Emperours necke
Much lesse the rich Foole in the
Gospell, with his goods increasing
and Barnes enlarged: or the rich
Glutton, with his delicate fare and
purple rayment, or any other gli|stering
apparences of happinesse
which dazle the eyes of the doti
world. Let become of the rest wh
will, so that this be my Lot an
portion (which euer let be my wi
aboue all wishes) that through
Gods grace and Christs blod, 
may haue a good Conscience, and b
assured that I haue one, desiring i
all things to walke honestly.

In which Text or, Woofe of
Scripture, which I may call Pauls
Triumph, I finde these Threads:
1. The excellent matter, A good
CONSCIENCE. 2. The glori|ous
manner, A certaine confidence.
The Trophies are not meane
and base,Seges gloriae. but the richest gift which
Christ ascending on high, left vs
to reioyce in, a good conscience.
The boasting is not vaine:Serius trium|phus. it's no
fantasticall opinion, no fanaticall
Reuelation, but a true perswasion;
we are assured: It's no audacious
presumption, but a grounded as|sertion,
built vpon these foure pil|lers,
as so many Characters of a
good conscience, 1. Desiring, 2. In
all things, 3. To walke or conuerse,
4. Honestly.
Now that we may more di|stinctly
apprehend the Contents
of the Text, and that which is best
of all, attaine the scope and subiect|matter
thereof, which is the end of

all, a GOOD CONSCIENCE;
because many talke of Conscience,
few know it; I will first discouer
the Nature of it, which hath beene
darkned by Schoole definitions,
and Rhetoricall descriptions.
Secondly, because many slips
and bad ones goe for currant and
good ones: most bragge of a good
one, and fewest haue it, I will shew
you the goodnesse thereof, where|in
it consists, how it is made good,
and how it is distinguished from
seeming good ones, and how by
foure infallible Characters it's cer|tainely
approued and knowne to
be good.
Because it's a dead commodity,
a Grape of Canaan, the sweetnesse
whereof few haue tasted, and they
that haue it cannot vtter it; I will
shadow out the excellency of it, as
my poore skill and experience will
allow me.
Lastly, when I haue taught Con|science

to know it selfe and it own
worth; I will set it a worke to doe
it office in the application of the
points of this  al other Sermons.
Briefly collect and remarke the
heads.

1. What Conscience is.
2. What a good one is; how it may
be discerned from bad ones, and
knowne to be good.
3. How good a thing it is.
And 4. What is the vse, office and
effect of a good one.


The first part.
For the Nature of it. Things
that are neerest, and most neerely
concerne vs, are commonly far|thest
off our knowledge and re|spect.
As God, that is in vs and
neere vnto vs; our owne faces and
visages are hardliest knowne, hard|liest
remembred. Som fooles doubt
whether there be such a thing in
them, yea or no. Origen thought it

a Spirit or Genius, associated to our
soules, to guide and tutour them:
but this is like some of his other
conceits. The carnal Atheist thinks
it a melancholy humour of the bo|dy,
and so thinkes all the checks
thereof to be effects of Humour.
The Schoole men somewhat acu|ter,
thought it, some, an habite,
some, an act of the soule. The lat|ter
Diuines, a faculty of the intel|lectuall
part: but the trueth is, it's
no such In-mate, no such Guest of
the soule, but an in-bred faculty of
it: A noble and diuine power, plan|te
of God in the soule, working vpon
it selfe by reflection: Or thus. The
soule of a man recoyling vpon it selfe.
A facultie I call it, because it pro|duceth
acts,Hugo  Ber|nus. and is not got  lost as
habits are, but is inseperable from
the soule, immoueable from the
subiect, as neither acts nor habits
are, which is Thomas his chiefe rea|son
to proue Conscience an act,

quia deponi potest; the cleane contra|rie
whereof is true, though indeede
one might thinke some had laid a|side
and lost their Conscience.
A noble faculty I call it, because
so admirably strange in the reci|procall
working of it. The eye of
man sees not it selfe but by the
helpe of a looking-glasse: neither
hath any creature in this world this
priuiledge and property besides
the soule of man. I giue it roome,
and place it in the whole soule, and
thrust it not, as some haue done,
like a Spider, into some corner of it,
as if it were a part of a part; where|as
the operation and power of it
is circumscribed in no narrower
bounds then the soule it selfe, and
therefore the Hebrewes more apt|ly
call it  Heart or Soule, and the
Grecians . If our heart con|demne
vs, 1 Ioh. 3. 20.
It hath indeed the vnderstand|ing
for the Throne and Pallace

thereof, where it is chiefly resident,
whereby it exerciseth the princi|pall
functions, from whence com|monly
it hath it name Conscience; as
the Emperour of Russia from Mosco
his chiefe Citie: and looke how the
soule it selfe is chiefly seated in the
head, and there performeth the
chiefe actions of Reason, Discourse
and Sence, yet is in all and euery
part of the body, and in them
performeth, baser and meaner of|fices
of Nourishment and Moti|on:
right so the Conscience kee|peth
a compleat Court in the
whole Soule, commonly called
Forum Conscienciae.
In the Vnderstanding part it is
a Iudge, determining and prescri|bing,
absoluing  condemning de iure.
In the memory, it is a Register,
a Recorder, and witnesse, testify|ing
de Facto. In the Will and Affe|ctions,
a Iayler and Executioner,
punishing and rewarding. Say wee

not in common vse of Speech,
which is the Emperour of Words,
My Conscience tels mee I did or
did not such a thing, which is an
Action of the Memory? My Con|science
bids mee doe, or forbids
me to doe this or this, which is
but an Action of the Will: It
smites mee, it checkes mee, it com|forts,
or it torments mee: what
are these but Actions of the Af|fections
recoyling vpon the Soule?
But if any list to contend about
these subtilties, Conscience tells
them, it hath no such custome.
Conscience falsely so called, delight|eth
to languish about Questions
not tending to Edification; Let
vs rather turne our eyes, to be|hold
and wonder at the Diuine
royalties and endowments of it,
it being in man the principall part
of GODS Image, and that by
which Man resembleth most the
Autarchie and selfe-sufficiencie of

GOD, which I graunt is proper
to his Infinitenesse, to be content
and compleat within it selfe: but
vnder him, and with his leaue
and loue, this Facultie makes man
selfe-sufficient and independant of
other Creatures; like vnto those
selfe-mouing Engins, which haue
their Principle of Motion within
themselues. Thus, Adam when hee
was alone, was not yet alone  de|solate,
but might conuerse with this
his Conscience, as well as with a
thousand Companions and Ac|quaintances.
Secondly, God hath giuen it
more force and power to worke
vpon men, then all other Agents
whatsoeuer: It being internall and
domesticall, hath the aduantage
of all Forraigne and Outward.
Man in this respect being like to
the Earth, immoueable of all the
windes, though at once they
should blow from all the points of

the Compasse, yet easily shaken
by a vapour from within: whence
it is that the Approofes and Re|proofes
of it, are so powerfull and
terrible, the one chearing more
then any Cordiall, the other gnaw|ing
more then any Chest-worme;
tormenting worse then hot Pin|cers,
boyling Caldrons, Rackes,
Strappadoes, or what other the
cruelty of Tyrants hath inuented.
If one had Angels daily ascending
and descending, as Iacob had to
comfort him, it were not so com|fortable,
or if langold or coupled
to Diuels, no more terrible.
Thirdly, it being indiuiduall
and inseperable, there is no put|ting
of it to flight, or flying from
it:Lyp. Pol. Ne fugere, nec fugare poteris. It
was bred and borne with vs, it
will liue and die with vs. Agues
a man may shake off, Tyrants and
ill Masters a man may flye from:
but this saith (as Ruth to Naomi,)

I will goe with thee whether so euer
thou goest. It hath more imme|diate
deputation and authoritie
from GOD (of whom all princi|palities
and powers receiue theirs)
then Angels, Kings, Magistrates,
Father, Mother, or any other Su|periour.
It's onely inferiour to
GOD: It is a certaine middle
thing betweene GOD and Man,
and hath the dignitie of Earles
and Nobles, that are Comites Re|gum.
And so Paul is bolde, Ro|manes
9. to call his Conscience a
Co-witnesse with GOD; whence
it hath the Name Conscience,
there being no other Creature
with whom it can beare witnesse:
none knowing what is in Man,
saue God, and the Spirit, or Con|science
which is man; which makes
Paul ioyne them in one Appeale,
Romanes 9. It's his Spie and In|telligencer
in our bosomes and
Bed-chambers; a most exact No|tarie

of what euer wee thinke or
doe: It's his Lieutenant, and vn|der
him the principall Commaun|der,
and chiefe Controler of Mans
life, yea, euery mans GOD in
that sense that Moses was Aarons.
It's the surest Prognostication and
Prae-indgement of GODS last
Iudgement,Praeidicium extremi Iudicij. Tertul. and best Almanacke
within a Mans owne breast, fore|telling
him what will become of
him at that day.
Wonderfull is the Greatnesse
and Soueraigntie of it: Oh men
therefore, and oh Consciences,
know your selues, and in this
sence loue, respect, and reuerence
your selues more then all other
Creatures, Friends and Acquain|tance:
If they could speake, they
would say to mans Conscience,
as the people to Dauid, a thou|sand
of vs are not equall to thee
in worth. It fares with Consci|ence
as with simple Constables;

Many an Officer, if hee knew his
place, would stand more vpon it,
and take more vpon him then hee
doth. The Husband-man were
happy, if he knew his happinesse:
The Horse were strong, if he knew
his strength. Conscience, if it knew
power and authoritie, would not
suffer it selfe, so to be silenced, abu|sed,
snibbed, and kept vnder, being
vnder GOD, the Lord Controu|ler
of the Soule, and Super visour
of our life.


The second Part.
Thus haue wee seene in part
the greatnesse of Conscience: doth
it not concerne vs now to see the
goodnesse of it; the greatnesse of
it making it, if good, nothing bet|ter,
if bad, nothing worse; the su|rest
Friend and the seuerest Foe?
Whose heart burnes not within
him, to heare wherein that good|nesse

consists, and how hee may
come by it.
The goodnesse of it, is the
peace of it; for stirring, accu|sing,
and galling Consciences, are
consequents of Sinne, and presup|pose
some euill.
They secondly proue good vn|to
vs onely by accident, and
Gods goodnesse, which maketh
them as afflictions, gather Grapes
of Thornes: yea, all things worke
to the best of his beloued, as Phy|sitians
doe Poysons in their Con|fections.
And thirdly, they doe not al|wayes
produce this effect. Some|times,
as Sicknesses and Purgati|ons,
they are in order to health, as
in the Iewes, Act. 2. Oftentimes as
in Cain, Iudas, Achitophell, they de|stroy
their owners.
Good Consciences therefore,
properly to speake, are onely quiet
ones, excusing and comforting;

but here take heede the Diuell, the
great Imposter of our Soules, put
not vpon our folly and simplicity,
three sorts of quiet ones, as hee
doth to most. The Blinde, the Se|cure,
and the Seared.
Binde and ignorant Consciences
speak peace or hold their peace, be|cause
they haue not skill enough
to accuse  fin fault: they swal|low
many a flie, and digest all well
enough. While the scales were vp|on
Pauls eyes, hee was aliue and
quiet: he thought Concupiscence,
the sincke and breeder of all sinne,
to be no sinne. Such Consciences
discerne innes as wee doe Starres
in a darke night; see only the great
ones of the first magnitude, where|as
a bright Euening discouers mi|lions:
or as wee see a few moates
in darke houses, which Sunne-light
shewes to be infinite. Such thinke
good meaning will serue the turne,
that all Religions will saue, or a

Lord haue mercy on vs, at the last
gaspe: and that which is worst of
all, they loue to liue vnder blinde
Sir Iohns, seeke darke corners, say
they are not Booke-learned nor
indeede will suffer their Consci|ences
to proue good Lawyers in
Gods Booke, least they should
proue common Barrettors. The
Law which nature hath engrauen
they tread out with sins, as men do
the ingrauings of tombs they walk
on, with foule shooes: they dare not
looke in the Glasse of Gods Law,
which makes sin abound, least the
foulnesse of their Soules should af|fright
them. A number of such sot|tish
Soules there be, whose Con|sciences
if God opens as he did the
eyes of the Prophets Seruant, they
shall see Armies and Legions of
Sinnes and Diuels in them.
In as pittifull a plight as this, are
secure, sleepy, and drousie Con|sciences,
who see, but will not see;

with whom Sinne, Sathan, and
their Conscience is not at Peace,
but at Truce for a time: safe they
are not, onely secure they be and
carelesse. These sleepe and delight
in sleeping; and two wayes especi|ally,
the Diuell pipes and luls them
a sleepe, by Mirth, and by Busi|nesse.
Ease and Prosperitie slayes
some fooles, Wealth and Hearts|ease,
like Dalah, rockes them a|sleepe
on her lap: Iesting and mer|ry
tales, eating and drinking casts
them into a spirit of slumber, and
puts their Sinne and Iudgement
farre away, and makes them say
they shall neuer be moued. While
they prosper and flourish in the
world, their Consciences deale as
Creditors with their debters:
whiles they are in trading and do|ing,
say nothing to them, but if
once downe the winde, in sicknes,
crosses and pouerty, then Arrest
vpon Arrest, Action vpon Action,

then come the Fowles of the Aire
and seaze vpon the sicke Soule, as
the Rauens vpon sicke Sheepe,
write bitter things against them,
and make them possesse the sinne
of their youth. Marke this you
that dwell at ease, and swimme in
wealth in London. Your Conscien|ces
that lie stil like sleepy Mastiues;
in plague times and sweating sick|nesses,
they flie in the throate: they
flatter like Parasites in Prosperitie,
and like Sycophants accuse in Ad|uersitie.
Businesse also and Cares
of this life choake the Conscience,
and the voice of manifold imploy|ments
drowne the voyce of Con|science,
as the Drummes in the Sa|crifices
to Moloch the cry of the In|fants.
And such Consciences are
quiet, not because they are at
Peace, but because they are not at
Leasure. Marke then you that haue
Mils of businesse in your Heads,
whole West-Minster-Hals, Bursses,

Exchanges and East-Indies, (as I
feare many of you haue whilst I
am speaking to your Conscience)
that making hast to be rich, ouer|lay
your braines with affaires, are
so busie in your Counting-house
and Bookes, and that vpon this
very Day, that you neuer haue
once in a week, or yeere, an houres
space to conferre with your poore
Consciences; yea, when did you?
Let your Consciences answere
within you. No, but if at a Sermon
you appoint them a time, and say
you will, you disappoint them
and say as Agrippa to Paul, Wee
will heare thee another time: and
for the most part doe as hee did,
that is, neuer heare them againe.
All these sleepers haue but a ren|sie
mans sleepe; this Tranquilitie
will be sure to end in a Tempest.
Yet in a more horrible case, and
step nearer Hell, are such as seare
their Consciences with an hot

Iron, harden them of purpose, as
men doe Steele, by quenching the
motions of them; brand them with
often sinning against their check|ing;
fleshing tender Nouices with
this counsell, when their Consci|ences
trouble them for any thing,
then to doe it the rather, and so
they shall heare no more of them:
and so it proues through Gods iust
iudgement giuing them ouer to a
reprobate sense, that their Consci|ences
serue them as Moses did Pha|raoh,
hauing receiued many re|pulses,
and at last commanded to
come no more in sight, forbare
to lose any more breath vnto him,
but complained to God, who
swept him and his Hoast away
with a finall destruction.
When Tutors and Paedagogues
are weary with Pupils, they giue
them ouer to their Parents fury:
these are , and to these
villaines there is no peace, saith

my God, and my Text. These men
Consciences if euer they awake,
(as seldome they doe) they awake
as Ionas, in fearefull astonishment;
and if they sleepe out this life till
their long sleep, yet their Condem|nation
sleepeth not. Thinke of this
you monsters, scorners, and mock-Gods,
that forget your Consci|ences,
least they awake and teare
you in pieces. Be not my Brethren
deceiued with any of these decei|uing
Consciences; Children of
darknesse: Though Conscience be
not vsually mocked, yet many de|ceiue
their owne heart, Iam. 1. 26. for
want of examination. Many say 
thinke in their Consciences, that
they haue good Consciences, when
GOD saith, Oh that this people
had such a good Conscience: and
so Paul speakes in my Text, as once
to Agryppa, Oh that you were as I
am, assured that you haue a good Con|science,
desiring, c.

What then is a good Consci|ence?
That which speakes Peace
with Gods allowance, which is a
Messenger of good things between
God and vs, that vpon good
grounds, is in good tearmes with
God: It lyes in the lawfull peace
of it, and not in integritie and free|dome
from sinne. If my Consci|ence
accuse me not, yet am I not
thereby iustfied, God is greater
then my Conscience. If any Con|science
say to any man, hee hath
no sinne, it lyes in the throate, and
is a Lyer. Adam onely had such
a Paradise, such a good Consci|ence,
walking with God, without
sinne, without feare, in the state
of Innocencie. There is but one
way now to come to it: our peace
is now to be had by Mediation and
Reconciliation; being iustified by
Christs bloud wee haue this peace.
In stead of many, marke one re|markable
place of Scripture for

this purpose. If you aske what
makes a good Conscience, there is
but one thing in the world will
make it, Hebr. 9. 14. The bloud of
Christ once offered by his eternall Spi|rit,
without fault, purgeth our Consci|ences
from dead workes. Yea, so ad|mirable
is the force of this bloud,
that it leaues no more conscience
of Sinne within it.Heb. 10. 2. This Lambe
takes them away, and carries them
out of Gods remembrance into
the Wildernesse of Obliuion. If
thy Conscience rage as the Sea,
Christ cast into it, as Ionas, whists
all the waues of it. If the Law make
it as Mount Sinay, couered with
darknesse, the Gospell calmes and
lightens it presently. If tossed as
the Ship where the Disciples say|led
in the night, hee rebukes the
Windes, and they are still: if the
Diuels rend and rage in it, he casts
them out presently.
The Iaylor came in trembling,

ready to fordoe himselfe, Beleeue
in Christ, sent him out leaping and
reioycing. It's strange how freely,
effectually, and speedily hee quiets
all. Oh all ill Consciences, heare
and beleeue; this is the honour,
royalty, and peculiar dignitie of
Christs bloud, to pacifie and make
good our Consciences! I doe not
so much admire at all his mira|culous
healings of Diseases, Le|pries,
Blindnesse, and Lamenesse,
Daemoniackes of all sorts, as I
doe at his gracious and sodaine
quietting of the Conscience of
Mary Magdalen, of Zacheus, of
Paul; and so the like vertue this
bloud hath still, to day and ye|sterday
the same. Nothing else in
the world hath this vertue saue
his bloud: all other merriments
haue no more power to quiet
Conscience, then Holy-water and
Charmes to coniure the Diuell.
I finde in a French Comedie

one brought in as troubled in
Conscience for sinne, and he runs
vp and downe like a Hart with
an Arrow in the side, for reme|die,
hee buyes a Pardon, runnes
to Shrift, whips himselfe, goes on
Pilgrimages; and all this while, like
an Aguish man that drinkes water,
or leapes into a Poole, his disease
increaseth; then fals hee to seeke
merry company, to see if hee can
play away his trouble; but like
Sauls ill spirit, it returnes with grea|ter
violence,  brings seauen worse
with it to torment. In the end hee
findes Christ, or rather is found of
Christ, and so findes peace,  this is
the good Conscience we speake of,
to which being in Christ, there is no
Condemnation, no Accusation.
Wouldst thou purchase a good
conscience at an easier rate? wouldst
thou haue it for sleeping? When
thou hast tried al conclusions, come
hither  buy salue for thy Consci|ence

without money. When thou
hast spent all thy time and money
about what will not quiet thy
minde, as Alchimists smoake out all
in seeking the Philosophers-Stone,
here is that which will doe it; be|leeue
and proue, and thou and thy
Conscience shall be safe and quiet:
this is approued, thus Paul got his.
Yea, but is this all? Is it so cheape
and easie athing? May we now sing
a Requiem to our Soules, lay the
reynes on our neckes cast care a|way,
and doe what we list? I feare
not such an obiection from a true
beleeuing Conscience. They that
prattle thus, know not Ingeniu~ fidei
 bonae Conscientiae, the good nature
of Faith and a good Conscience.
Let me not daube your Consci|ences
with vntempered Morter.
Faith as it pacifieth, so it purifieth
Conscience. Christ purgeth our
consciences to serue the liuing God,
and after all his cures, bids the hea|led

goe away and walke after the
Spirit, and sin no more. There are
indeede a generation of Libertines
and hypocrites that serue Christ, as
Lewes the 11. is reported to haue
serued his leaden Crucifixe which he
vsed to weare in his hat,  when he
had blasphemed or done any vil|lany,
he would pull it off and kisse
it, and so sinne ouer and ouer a|gaine;
like our common Swearers,
that crye God mercy, and aske him
leaue to abuse his Name againe,
and that wittingly and willingly.
These and such like, let their
Consciences speake peace to them,
as the Fryer in Stephan absolued a
Gentleman, that would needes pay
well, yet would not promise to a|mend
his fault, in stead of an Ab|solution
hee pronounced a Curse
vpon him in Latine, which hee
tooke for pay; Christ absolue thee,
which I beleeue he will not; and bring
thee to Heauen, which is impossible.

Many Sentencs hath the Master
of Sentences borrowed from Am|brose,Lib. 4. Dist. 14.
against such Consciences,
which I omit to rehearse, least as
Abners body, they hinder the pas|sing
of the people by. A good Con|science
stands not with a purpose
of sinning; no, not with an irreso|lution
against sin. He is a foole and
a vaine mocker, no true penitent,
that mournes for sin past, and yet
meanes at the same time to sin for
the time to come. With which So|phisme
the most perish at this day,
with this in their mouthes; They be|leeue
on Christ, and haue as good a
Conscience as the best, and yet walke
in sinne. But oh thou vaine fellow,
shew mee Pauls good Conscience
by Pauls proofe, by his Desire in all
things, c. Is Christ able to saue
thee, and is he not able to sanctifie
thee? Let mee with Tertullian, tell
thee, that the promises standing
true, thy faith is false,  the Gospel

remaining safe, thou shalt perish.
Titus, a Trades-man or Lawyer
here present, happily is desirous to
haue peace of Conscience, is sorry
for his oathes  frudulent courses
this week past, but knowes he shall
fall to the like the week comming,
hates them not, and meanes not to
striue against them, but to returne
to the myre, my Text saith not to
him, Goe in peace, to such loose and
licentious Consciences that make
Christ a bawd of sinning,  Faith
a cloak of liberty. I haue heard that
the Pope hath sold a Pardon for a
Murther past, with a dispensation
annexed for the next.: but Christ
my Lord and master (as bountifull
 gracious as he is) grants no such.
If he forgiue that which is past, hee
giues at least so much Grace, as to
deny vngodlinesse for the time to
come. To conclude this point; thou
desirest a good conscience, without
indending or conditioning, I bid

thee beleeue in Christ,  thou hast
one; yet take this, not into the bar|gaine,
but as an after prouiso: Art
thou willing to haue a good Con|science,
and to be assured thereof,
here follow foure infallible Cha|racters
and marks of a good one,
which I desire you to mark atten|tiuely,
and by them to try your
Consciences throughly. Hitherto
I haue shewed how you may get
one: now how you may proue
one. Here are foure Elements or
humors, which well compounded
 mixed, make vp a perfect health
of Conscience: if any one be wan|ting,
or faile in a iust measure or
proportion, Conscience is accor|dingly
defectiue and sicke.
The first,. is that which must be
the first in euery good action, that
is, the Will, that the bent  inclina|tion
of that be set right. I would the
word had been plainly translated
as it is in other places, verbatim, wil|ling:

It implyes first; that hee that
hath a good Conscience, doth
not onely doe well, but wills to
doe well, doth it voluntarily, not
forcedly, or out of externall and
siiter motions, but from an in|ternall
principle, a sanctified and
rectified will, which God accepts
for the deede, and aboue the deed.
Secondly, that he doth not onely
wish and faintly desire, which
Translation may flatter an hypo|crite
that hath some sluggish lusts
and some sodaine good pangs
and moodes, and such as for the
time little differ in sicknesse and
starts from a regenerate will: but
the word notes a strong and setled
resolution, a constant purpose, and
such as produceth endeuour. Hee
tht will be rich, pierceth himselfe
through with many sorrowes,
where the same word is vsed; I
graunt it is Carnificina, a racke to
a good Conscience, to say, It must

alwaies doe well; and contrarily,
it's a true ground of comfort, to
say, that a will and purpose is suf|ficient
testimonie and approofe of
a good one: but then it must be
meant, not euery languishing and
lazie flash of euery wisher and
woulder, but of a willer; and this
word is equal with the other two,
which are good Synonimaes and
Glosses vpon this, vsed by Paul,
Act. 23. 24. I labour, or exercise
my selfe, and , I lay my
policie, or bend my wit and will to
haue a good Conscience, and to
serue God, c.
It may be said of some, They
would be good, but they haue no
will to it. There is none so pro|digall
or sloathfull but would be
rich; Yet we say not, such will be
rich, that is, set it downe, deter|mine
it vltimata voluntate. There
are none so wicked, but at some
times would be good, and leaue

sinne; but these dispositions breed
imperfect Essayes and profers, ri|pen
not, hold not, discerne not
the name of Will. Corrupt flesh
hath many such Propensities and
Bubles, and is very prodigall in
momentanie purposes, and pro|mises;
but Dauid saith, hee will
keepe Gods Commaundements:
I haue vowed, sworne, c. when
Michol mocked, I will yet be more
vile; as resolute Swaggerers, whose
Will is set and sould to sinne:
They sinne and will sinne, say
Preachers what they can. Ahab
will goe, crie Micaia what hee
please; so Iosuah will serue God,
let others doe what they will.
Sanctified Will may be crossed,
and captiued, and hindered, but
yet it holds it owne bent, and o|uercomes
the Law of Rebellion,
is predominant, and can neuer be
forced to sinne, or to will to sinne,
without a curbe in the mouth,

the more stiffe and steady this Will
is, the better Symptome of a good
Conscience.
Secondly,. this Will must extend
it selfe to ; Though in many
things our deedes faie: which
extent et Paul expound with a
distribution, towards GOD and
Man, Acts 2. In duties Diuine,
Humane, of Charitie and Piety,
whatsoeuer is done for Gods sake
and for Conscience sake, is done
equally: No man makes a Con|science
of one, but hee that doth
of all: hee that delights in the
breach of one Commandement,
hates all the rest. The rich and
precious boxe of a good Consci|ence,
is polluted and made im|pure,
if but one dead Flye be suf|fered,
I say not, if one Flye of
Infirmitie light in it, against
the will fore-mentioned, but if
with our will it lye, and dye, and
putrifie in it. When Christ purg|eth

Maries conscience, hee casts
out not sixe but seauen Diuels,
yea, hee leaues not one of the Le|gion
remaining, not one spot of
Leprie in any one member, but
saith, Faith hath made thee whole.
Here I see many fall short, and I
pitie to see so many ciuill men and
hypocrites to come so neere the
Kingdome of heauen and a good
Conscience, and yet one thing is
wanting. Foolish Herod, that doest
many things and stickest at one:
Foolish Ananiah, that spilst and
losest all thy cost with a small re|seruation.
Foolish hypocrite, why
takest thou paines to climbe so
high on the hill of Piety, and yet
for one step of iniustice to thy
neighbour, ascends not into Gods
Mountaine, though thou commest
often into Gods Tabernacle. Thou
ciuill honest man, why giuest thou
Almes, liuest fairely with man, and
forgettest the maine, art so farre

short of this All things, that thou
forgettest that which should be
all in all, that is, Pietie to God?
Vniuersall and Catholicke obedi|ence,
is the best distinguishing
Touchstone of trueth and false|hood,
of good  bad Consciences.
This Vniuersality must also ex|tend
to great and small duties. I
say Vniuersality, not equality: A
good Conscience mainely desires
to please God in the great Com|mandements,
as Christ cals them,
and then in euery complement, in
euery hoofe and naile, so neere as
he can, yet obseruing a due pro|portion.
It most of all straines at
grosse sinnes, yet swallowes not
Gnats. It trembles a Wounds and
Blood, feares Faith and Troth. It
abhorres Adulterie, hates Dali|ance:
It payes Tithe-sheaues care|fully,
it detaines not Tithe, Mint,
and Anniseede: It sayes not, an
inch breakes no square, and small

faults must be wincked at; and in
this sence may well be said to be
scrupulous, because it being ten|der
feeles scruples: onely here I
lay a Caueat, that it be not erroni|ous,
or ignorantly dubious and
scrupulous, like the wall-eyed or
bird-eyed Horse, that starts vpon
euery shaddow without occasion
or cause: makes Conscience where
God and his Word makes none,
makes many questions for Consci|ence
sake. Light and information
is as good as tendernesse, both to|gether
make an excellent Consci|ence,
and obiter for the sake of
scrupulous Consciences, that de|sire
vnfainedly in all things to
walke honestly, I giue them these
solemne charges.
First, that they study the peace
of the Church.
Secondly, that they study their
liberties.
Thirdly, that they be humble

towards God and their Superi|ours,
and willing to illuminate and
regulate their Consciences by the
Word, and be established in what
they are to doe, not admitting eue|ry
feare of the contrary without
ground, yet remembring Pauls
rule, to follow the Dictate of Con|science,
rather then of Angell, Po|tentate
or Prelate, yea of Apostle.
For, after the Apostle had deter|mined
that, in the 14. to the Ro|manes,
he yet requires in the Eater
a Plerophorie, and blesseth him that
doth it with consent of Consci|ence,
and makes all other Sinne a
Sinne against Conscience, being
worse then a Sin against Man, yea,
next to the Sinne against the Holy
Ghost. An erronious Conscience
holds the Wolfe by the eares,
bindes to the Act, frees not from
the fault: Oh therefore labour to
get a Salue, and thinke not your
owne eye-sight to be sharper then

the Eagles. Endeauour to informe
your Consciences aright, and ha|uing
so done, be carefull in all
things to keepe a good Consci|ence,
and that throughout the
whole tenour and course of your
liues, which is required in the next
terme of Conuersation.
 A word that addes to the for|mer,
Constancy, and Equality: there
are in the life of Man many tur|nings,
references, and diuers re|spects,
in all these; at euery turne
to be the same Man, requires the
 of a good Conscience: to
 well, a Childe or
a  may, but to walke
euen  turne hither and
thher , argues rength. A
 or  broken paced Horse, may
rack or strie a stroke or two
right, but to maintaine the tho|rough-pace,
at euery stop  turne
to be at the commaund of the Ri|der,
argues mettall and goodnesse.

This terme is expressed by Paul,.
Acts 23. 1. I haue alwayes, or
throughly, to this day; and 24. 16.
.. That is,
without tripping or stumbling, or
without oftence to other, c. A
weake Conscience falls at euery
turne; godly in one company, pro|phane
in another: a good one, as a
Square Cube, is the same which
way soeuer you turne him: Turne
him to God, to his Neighbour,
turne him to company, turne him
alone, turne him loose to all oc|currences,
he holds his owne, and
wakes honestly. For example,
one day is the briefe of a Mans
whole life, and is a little life, boun|ded
with the Night and the Mor|ning,
as with Birth and Death:
wherein a conscionable man first
turnes to God in Prayer alone,
then with his Family, then to his
Calling, then to his Recreation, to
Society, Eating and Drinking, and

at night returnes to God and his
rest; in all these walking gody, so|berly,
righteously, and is able to
say trulier then the Epicure at
night,. I haue liued this day: I haue
walked honestly; hee is a good
Dayes-man, or Iourney-man, or
Tasker, which is an excellent my|sterie
of well liuing and Redemp|tion
of time, a working vp our Sal|uation
in holinesse and righteous|nesse,
all the dayes of our life: hee
that lets slip one dayes watch and
worke, may sleepe at night in a
whole skinne, but not in a sound
Conscience.Turbid  Lu|cid intrualla. Such crazie Consci|ences
haue, as broken brains, their
good and euill dayes. Conscience
as a vessell may easily be kept pure
and cleane if rinsed euery day; but
if it goe longer, it gathers soyle,
and askes harder scouring by more
then ordinary Repentance. Daily
washing will keepe it pure and
faire, which is the last thing which

is yet wanting to perfection, such
perfection as is to be found in the
way: and that being added, will
st on the roofe and pinnacle vp|on
this building.
, Honesly, I could wish 
the Translatours had vsed some
other word, because this is so dis|gracefull
and conpble as the
world goes, though the word in
the ou signification is honoura|be,
Honese in trueth (as ironically
as the world vseth it) being onely
truely honourable, forcing honour
from the breasts of men, which is
the seat of honour, which braue|rie
doth but begge. The word is
comprehensiue, and compasseth
in the fadome of it, as much as any
or all the other Aduerbs in Scrip|ture,.
worthily, decently, accurately,
circumspectly, grauely, after the best
fashion, or comely, praise-worthy,
liuely, famously. It notes the lustre
and grace of an action, which

makes our conuersation shine be|fore
men, and sets out Gods glory.
, A thing that Citizen and
Courtier much standvpon in their
Actions, yea all men now a daies
build, feast, weare apparell, not for
bare necessity, but for their credit,
so as they may get honestie by
them. Vnconscionable men slub|ber
ouer their worke, and thinke
any thing good enough for God,
as in Malachie: and content them|selues
with reasonable seruice, for
so they translate that,. Rom. 12.
Wheras Paul often requires Chri|stians
should be excellent ringlea|ders
in faire workes;. and prouide
honest or honourable things be|fore
men, and to possesse their ves|sels,
much more their Consciences
in honour, that they may be fit
Temples for the Holy Ghost. As
Theodoret most diuinely vpon Exo|dus,
looke how the Temple was a|dorned
with the finest Gold, Siluer,

Silke,, c. Purple, Scarlet, Iewels, c.
So must thy Conscience, of which
Temples this was but a Type.
There is in euery dutie, besides
the deed done, an honourable de|corum
annexed, as in hearing, to
heare swiftly; in preaching, to la|bour
 to be instant in season, c.
in giuing Almes, to doe it cheere|fully;
in trading to be at a word;
in payments  promises to keepe
day and touch: and thus it be|comes
a Christian to exceede the
Parisee, and the ciuill man, or else
it is not for his, and his Masters
honour.
Dauid did excellently when he
would not offer a Sacrifice with|out
cost: The woman that spent
her costly Spicknard on Christ, the
smell whereof perfumed all the
house, and holds the scent to this
day: The Widdow that gaue all
her substance. Our honourable
personages, how meane are they

in allowances to Ministers, in
Almes to the poore, or any expen|ces,
that respect GOD and their
soules. A good Conscience for the
sake of this honestie, auoides and
flies, not onely scandalous ble|mishes
and staines, but all the least
blushes and appearances of euill,
all brackish tasted things his sto|macke
goes against them: If hee
knew neuer so well Cards, Dice,
Vsurie, Nonresidencie, Plurality
to be neuer so lawfull, yet because
they stand not with this honour,
he will none of them. He askes not
what he may doe with a safe Con|science,
but with an excellent one;
not what is lawfull and expedi|ent,
but honourable.
Thus haue we seene the Apostle
riding in this triumphant Chariot,
drawne as it were with these foure
horses, the foure euidences of
Conscience.
The first proues it good; the

second, true; the third, strong; the
fourth, excellent.
Hee that hath the Will, hath the
seeds of Religion, and is a Christi|an,
and no Atheist.
He that willeth in all things, is a
sound Christian, and no hypocrite,
He that conuerseth or walketh, is a
grown Christian, no babe or weak|ling.
He that walks honourably, is an ex|cellent
Christian, no ordinary one.
He that hath all these, may well
say and glory with the Apostles
confidence, that he is assured.
Hee that hath them not, as most
haue them not, may well conclude,
We are assured our Consciences are
euill and impure, willing to sinne, and
walke after the flesh.
The word is Pauls word,. and yet
he speakes it in the plurall number
by way of Syllepsis, changing the
number, because hee would haue
it the word of euery Christian.

 is a word of as good cer|tainty
as , it seconds and binds
it, as the better word, Rom. 14. I
know and am assured. Of it as of the
roote, springs , for all Bellar|mine
would eleuate it. It imployes
a grounded perswasion, not from
Inspiration or Reuelation, but
from Arguments and Experience..
Faith is the subsistance and eui|dence;
and the perswasion or assu|rance
of a Christian is as firme as
is any worldlings for his estate;
yea, a thousand times surer. You
rich men think your selues sure of
estates here vpon earth, but wee
Christians know our selues sure of
heauen. Conscience knowes it selfe,
as well as Science any Principle, or
Sense any Obiect. Without which
certainety, Christians were of all
men most miserable. Popery and
Nature, and the old Leuen of Pela|gius
newly worse sowred by Armi|nius,
neuer hauing had experience

of this Plerophorie, serue Christi|ans,
when they boast of this their
confidence, as Ananias did Paul,
strike them on the face with the
terme of pride and presumption;
yea, sticke not to giue them the lie;
but such betray themselues with
their owne noyse. I would aske
them but Pauls question, Doe not
you know? If they answere as vsual|ly
they doe, No; nor they thinke
any man liuing on earth: I would
pray them to marke what followes,
Except you be reprobate, reffuse, or
reiectanij, as yet in the state of Re|probation,
for ought they know.
Indeed it becomes the strumpet
and adultresse to doubt of her hus|band,
and not to call him Ishi,Hose 2. but
let him marke (saith Bernard) the
Spouses language; My beloued is
mine and I am his. See (saith he) what
a good Conscience dares doe. Habet
Ecclesia spirituales suos qu fiduciai|ter
agunt cum Christo: The Church

hath her spirituall ones that relye bold|ly
on Christ, or confidently; the very
terme that Bellarmine excepts a|gainst.
And, Id audet vnus, quod
audet vniuersit as; Ego puluis  ci|nis
c. Yea, euery particular per|son
dares doe as much as the Ca|tholike
Church; I that am dust and
ashes dare apply this to my selfe.
And Tompson vpon that Text.
These things (saith hee) are not writ|ten,
for I know not what ayrie Notions
or Idaea's, but for mee and thee. With|out
which, who would be a Chri|stian?
A mans Conscience is deepe
and deceitful, but the spirit of man,
especially helped by the Spirit of
God, and vpon examination and
tryall, may and doth know as well
(saith Augustine) his Charity wher|with
he loues, as his brother whom
he loues; and if his Charitie, then
his Faith.
Three Scioes I finde in the end
of Iohns Epistle. The Major or Pro|position

is Gods Word; The belee|uer
is saued. The Minor is assumed
by Gods Spirit  the Conscience,
two sufficient witnesses, fortified
and assisted by many prmisses, by
the compasse within, the land|markes
without, Faith, and the
fruits of Faith. Dost thou beleeue,
saith Christ? I beleeue, saith the
man. And this is the Restipulati|on
of a good Conscience in Bap|tisme,
and in euery true beleeuer.
Credis? Credo, was the ancient
forme, which answere, all wauerers
must reuerse and innovate. Lati|tudes
of assurance I grant in Babes
and old men. Dauid knew when he
came to Hebron, that God meant to
establish the kingdome to him and
his, which he knew before, but now
with a confirmed knowledge. The
Balances of the Scoale shake and
tremble at the first, after the weight
is in a while it settles and rests: and
so our Soules. And euen this Cer|taintie

is of the nature of all pre|cious
Faith, though experienced
Faith increaseth it. It's this Con|fidence
that makes a good Con|science,
this valour makes the va|lue
of it invaluable  invtterable.


The third Part.
Looke vpon my Text, and see
how valiantly by the right and in|terest
of it, Paul first challengeth 
commands prayers, euen at the
hands of the Iewes. Who waters a
dry stake with any heart? what
comfort hath Peter to pray for Si|mon
Magus in the gall of Bitternes?
but with what hope of audience
might hee pray for Cornelius, and
such as he was? So Iohn for Gaius
and the Elect Lady, walking in the
truth; not so for Diotrephes. Se|condly,
see how hee begs, not their
good opinion and good words of
him, though hee knew they had
strange surmises and suggestions

of him from the false Apostles; to
be a very Proteus and Polypus, the
graund Cheater of the world, but
in stead of Apologies and Capta|tion
of good will, hee relies to this
Fort, passeth not for mans day: he
is happy enough without them: he
carryes his comforter in his bo|some
and breast, and hath a selfe-sufficiency.
A dependant and behol|ding
happinesse is halfe a misery,
like Mils that cannot grinde with|out
winde or water, Saul cannot be
merry without a Filder: Ahab with|out
Naboths vineyard: aman with|out
Mordecayes curtesie. A good
Consnce without Musicke, or
Money, or Honour, is happy and
merry aone, and is like the late En|gn
of the perpetuall Motion.
As rich men stand vpon tearmes,
I can liue by you, and without
you: so saith a good Conscience to
the world.
It layes clayme not oney to the

prayers and communion of Saints,
but to the attendance of Angels.
As Luther is said to haue said, they
are Cookes and Butlers to this
continuall feast: they ascend and
descend to them with messages
from Heauen. Christ, as Ahashe|rosh
with Hester, delights to suppe
with such. The holy Ghost takes
vp in them his aboade and temple.
See in the Canticles how Christ is in|amoured
with the beauty and fa|miliaritie
of his Spouse, and they
often mutually inuite one another
to walkes and feasts.
Thirdly, which is more, in the
faile of all other comforts; yea, in
despight of the greatest discom|forts
and disgraces that can be, in
the greatest stormes and stresse, in
the foulest weather, this Shippe
raignes and rides at Anchor, as in
a Harbour and Lee, hangs out the
Flag of comfort and defiance. Let
the Iewes thinke and speake what

they will, it stirs not Paul: he soares
like an Eagle, not respecting the
chitting of Sparrowes; is aboue the
scourges and razors of tongues.
I am much taken vp with admi|ration,
when I reade Acts 27. How
Paul in the angry Adriaticall Sea, at
midnight, when the tempestuous
Euroclydon blew, after fourteene
daies want of meat and light, when
the Marriners despayred, how
couragious he was: but I wonder
as much and more, to see his Con|science
passe with top-saile  ban|ners
displayed, through the Sea
and waues of good report and bad
report; to see him singing  pray|ing
at midnight in the Dungeon,
all manacled  fettred, in a woun|ded
skinne, but whole and merry
Conscience.
Censures and rumors, the world
is full of: who escapes? Not Paul
himselfe; yet is aboue them, and
giues a secret Item to all such as

censure him, that they wronged
him in iudging a good Conscience.
The fashion is, to iudge and cn|sure
all courses wee reach not, or
sauour not; and so we smite many
a good Conscience. In this respect
what neede haue wee all of good
Consciences, seeing tongues spare
none
There be three dayes especially,
the day of Sicknesse, of Death, of
Iudgement; in which Comfort is
worth a world, and then all world|ly
comforts and comforters, like
run-away Seruants and drunken
Seruing-men, are to seeke when
one hath most vse and neede of
them, as Iob complaineth of the
Brooks of Teman in the drought of
Summer: which makes the tri|umph
of the wicked (Iob 20.) mo|mentany,
and as a ght Vision,
when as the Prophet said, One
dreames of bread, and wakes hun|gry.
In these times you shall see the

merry and iolly worldling hang
the head like a Bul-rush, and the
Ruffians brags lagge like a starcht
Ruffe in a storme. How doe such
droope, euen in old age, and say, the
dayes are come, wherein there is
no pleasure? The storme comes
after the raine, that which is worst,
an ill Conscience like a Blood-hound
hunts dry-foot, and brings
the scent of sins of his youth; wher|as
the Conscience of a well-passed
life is the staffe of age, Pabulum se|nile,
better then all the Sacke and
Sugars, and such pittifull comfor|ters.
When the stomacke failes, and
the grinders waxe few, and appe|tite
ceaseth, this is a continuall
feast. In the decay of sleepe, this is a
Downe-pillow. In all our tribula|tion,
this Simon helps vs to beare
our crosses. In all our euill daies, it's
at hand. It sustaines the infirmities
of the body. When Princes sat in
counsell against Dauid, this was his

Ionathan to solace him. When the
Lyon roares, the righteous is bold
as the Lyon, and feares not what
man can doe vnto him.
But if once Death begin to looke
vs in the face, how doth Naball
dye like a stone? How doe Achi|tophel
and Iudas dye the death of
cowardly Harts and Hares, pursu|ed
with the full cry of their sinnes,
which makes them dead in the ne
before they dye: then a kingdome
for a good Conscience. Then send
(as in the Sweating sicknesse and
the Plague) for M^r Minister, but
alas he is come, hee can but speake
to the eare, and all in vaine, vnlesse
God open the Conscience to heare
and be quiet, to heare and imbrace
comfort. But when speech failes, 
all thy Senses shut vp their doores
and windowes, then who or what
can auaile but a good Conscience?
When thy Wife  thy friends doe
augment thy griefe with parting

and loath to depart, as Pauls friends
broke his heart with weeping; then
this onely and alone dies, or rather
liues with thee, and seeing Land
approaching, bids thee be of good
comfort. More cheerefully haue I
seene it make some dye, then other
wed.
All the Martyrs from Stephen the
Proto martyr, down to the last that
suffered, are clouds of witnesses: it
hath inabled them to imbrace their
stakes, clap their hands, leape, as
Doctor Taylor did, within two stiles
of the stake, or (as hee said) of his
home and Fathers house.
Lastly, at the Last day, and after
the last day, when all these sha|dowes
shall flye away, this sub|stance
shall abide. A good Wife is
a good thing, but Sarah must part
with Abraham; and these relations
shall cease in Heauen, but a good
Conscience, attended with good
workes, shall follow: and the better

it hath beene here, the better in de|gree
it shall be there, the wider en|trance
and entertainment it shall
finde there. When all Bookes shall
perish, and Heauen melt like a
Parchment scrole, this Booke shall
be of vse; when all Diuels and dam|ned
shall tremble, and wish the hils
to couer them, this shall lift vp thy
head, for thy redemption approch|eth:
when neither friends, nor a full
purse shall pleade, nor the wicked
stand vpright in iudgement, then,
then, well-fare a good Conscience;
then shal conscience haue it mouth
opened, tongue vntied,  God will
bid it speake. Happy hee then that
hath an excusing one, miserable he
that hath it an accusing aduersary.
Yet still further: Faith and Hope
are excellent things here in this
valley; these shall cease, but Con|science
abides. A good one was a
petty heauen vpon earth, a mount
Tabor, a glimpse of glory here: a bad

one was a Hell, a Purgatory, or
Limbo, at the least, tasting of the
flashes and smoak of hel: but here|after
how intollerable shall be the
horror of the one, and how incon|ceieable
the ioyes of the other.
Without this worm that dies not,
hell should not be hel; without this
continual Feast, heauen should not
be heauen. Next the happy vision
of God shall be the company of a
good Conscience, and next to that
he Societie of Saints and Angels.


The last part.
But oh Lord, who beleeues our
eport? or to whom is the benefit
nd excellencie of this creature of
 reuealed? Oh Lord, to whom
hall we speake  apply what hath
een said? You the sonnes of men
aue ost your hearing, charme we
euer so wisely, thunder we neuer
 earnestly, you despise vs Mini|ers.
You thinke we come hither

to play our prizes, to speake out of
forme, and not of Conscience, or to
speake out of choller and passion.
Besides, if you would heare vs,
wee are Strangers to your secrets,
to your hearts and wayes; we are
confined to our Cells and Studies,
and are not acquainted with the
Tythe of the worlds villanies: be|sides,
when the Houre-glasse is
out, wee can say no more to you,
and perhaps shall neuer see you
againe; but your Consciences
know you, though happily you be
strangers to them, they compasse
your pathes, your lying downe,
and accustomed wayes.
I will therefore turne my speech
(as the Prophet to the Earth and
Heauen) to your Consciences.
Hearken oh Consciences, heare the
word of the Lord. I call you to re|cord
this day, that it's your office
to preach ouer our Sermons a|gaine,
or else all our Sermons and

labours are lost. You are the cuds
of the Soule, to chew ouer againe,
against your reproofes, and against
your secret and faithfull admoniti|ons
what exception can any take,
your Balme is precious, your smi|tings
break not the head, nor bring
any disgrace. GOD hath giuen
you a faculty to worke wonders in
priuate and solitude. Follow them
home therefore, cry aloud in their
eares, and bosomes, and apply what
hath now, and at other times beene
deliuered.
Conscience. If the house and
owner where thou dwellest be a
Sonne of Peace, let thy Peace, and
thy Masters Peace, abide and rest
on him: that Peace which the
world neuer knowes, nor can
giue, nor take away. Be thou pro|pitious,
and benigne, speake good
things, cherish the least sparks and
smoake of Grace: if thou findest
desire in trueth, and in all things,

bid them not feare and doubt of
their Election and Calling: With
those that desire to walke honestly,
walke thou comfortably; handle
the tender and fearefull gently
and sweetly: be not rough and ri|gorous
to them, binde vp the bro|ken-hearted,
say vnto them, Why
art thou so disquieted and sad?
when thou seest them Melancho|ly
for losses and crosses, say vnto
them in cheere, as Elkanah to An|nah:
What doest thou want? am not I
a thousand Friends, Wiues, and Chil|dren
vnto thee?
Clap them on the backe, hearten
them in well doing, spurre them
on to walke forward, yea winde
them vp to the highest pitch of
Excellencie, and then applaud
them: delight in the Excellent of
the earth.
Be a light to the blind and scru|pulous.
Be a Goad in the sides of the dull
ones.

Be an Alarum and Trumpet of
Iudgement to the Sleepers and
Dreamers.
But as for the Hypocrite, gall
him, and pricke him at the heart;
let him well know, that thou art
Gods Spie in his bosome, a secret
Intelligencer, and wilt be faithfull
to God.
Bid the Hypocrite walke in all
things.
Bid the Ciuill, adde Piety to
Charity.
Bid the wauering, inconstant,
and licentious, walke constantly.
Bid the luke-warme and com|mon
Protestant, for shame a|mend,
be zealous, and walke ho|nestly.
But with the Sonnes of Belial,
the prophane Scorners, walke |wardly
with them, haunt and mo|lest
them, giue them no rest till
they repent, be the gall of bitter|nesse
vnto them; when they are

swilling and drinking, serue them
as Absolons seruants did Amnon,
stab him at the heart: yet remem|ber
so long as there is any hope,
that thine office is to be a Paeda|gogue
to Christ, to wound and
kill; onely to the end they may
liue in Christ, not so much to ga|ster
and affright, as to leade to him;
and to that purpose, to be instant
in season and out of season, that
they may beleeue and repent.
But if they refuse to heare, and
sinne against thee, and the Holy
Ghost also: then shake off the dust
off they feete, and either fall to tor|ment
them before their time, and
driue them to despaire; or if thou
giue them ease here, tell them thou
wilt flie in their throat at the day
of hearing, when thou shalt and
must speake, and they shall and
must heare.
Conscience, thou hast Commis|sion
to goe into Princes Chambers

and Counsell Tables: be a faithfull
man of their Counsell. Oh that
they would in all Courts of Chri|stendome
set Policie beneath thee,
and make thee President of their
Counsels, and heare thy voyce, and
not croaking Iesuites, Sycophants
and Lyers; thou mayest speake to
them; Subiects must pray for them,
and be subiect for thy sake, to ho|nour
and obey them in the Lord.
Charge the Courtiers, not to
trust in vncertaine fauours of Prin|ces,
but to be trusty and faithfull,
as Nehemiah, Daniel, Ioseph, whose
Histories pray them to reade, imi|tate,
and beleeue, aboue Machia|uels
Oracles.
Tell the Foxes and Polititians,
that make the Maine the by, and
the by the Maine, that an ill Con|science
hanged Achitophell, ouer|threw
Haman, Shebna, c. Tell
them it's the best policie, and Salo|mons,
who knew the best, to get

and keepe thy fauor, to exalt thee,
and thou shalt exalt them, be a
shield to them, and make them as
bold as the Lion in the day of trou|ble,
not fearing the enuie of all the
beasts of the Forrest, no, nor the
roaring of the Lyon, in righteous
causes.
Conscience, Thou art the Iudge
of Iudges, and shalt one day iudge
them; in the meane while, if they
feare neither God nor man, be as
the importunate Widdow,  vrge
them to doe Iustice, Oh that thou
satest highest in all Courts, especi|ally
in such Courts as are of the Iu|risdiction,
and receiue their De|nomination
from thee: suer not
thy selfe to be exiled, make Foelix
tremble, discourse of Iudgement
to them.
To the iust Iudges, bid them
please God and thee, and feare no
other feare: assure them for what
ur they doe of partialitie or po|pularitie

thou wilt leaue them in
the lurch; but what vpon thy suite
and command, thou wilt beare
them out in it, and be their ex|ceeding
great reward.
If thou meetest in those Courts,
 findest any such Pleaders as are
of thine acquaintance and follow|ers,
be their fee and their promoter,
tell them if they durst trust thee,
and leaue Sunday workes, bribing
on both sides, selling of Silence,
pleading in ill Causes, and making
the Law a nose of waxe, if they
durst pleade all and onely rightfull
Causes, thou hast riches in one
hand, and Honour in the other to
bestow on them.
As for the Tribe of Leui, there
mayest thou be a little bolder, as
being men of God, and men of
Conscience by profession. Be ear|nest
with them to adde Con to their
Science, as a number to Cyphars
that will make it something worth.

Desire them to preach, not for
filthie lucre or vaine-glory, but for
thy sake; wish them to keepe thee
pure, and in thee to keepe the my|sterie
of Faith: assure them thou
art the onely Ship and Cabbinet
of Orthodoxall Faith, of which if
they make shipwracke, by lazinesse
and couetousnesse, they shall be
giuen ouer to Poperie and Armi|nianisme,
and lose the Faith, and
then write bookes of the Apostasie
and Intercision of Faith, and a
good Conscience, which they ne|uer
were acquainted withall, nor
some Drunkards of them euer so
much as seemed to haue.
And whereas thou knowest that
many of all sorts are discouraged
with the taxation and slaunders;
some that conferre, some that are
fearefull and doubtfull, if they doe
it to the Lord and thee (as who
knowes but God?) bid the world
as Paul doth here, turne censuring

into praying; and if they will not,
let them as they preach thee, so re|gard
thee in all godly simplicity,.
and expect their reward at the
hand of the great Shepheard.
For the Citie, get thou into the
high places, into the Pulpits, into
the Entries and gates of the Citie;
crie aloud, and vtter thy words in
the streetes: Oh that thou wert
free of it, and hadst freedome of
speech and audience in all their
Courts and Companies, and that
for thy sake they would make and
keepe wholesome Constitutions
for the Sabbath, and orderly kee|ping
of it, and see that well execu|ted
and obserued, which is the
Nurse of all Piety and Conscience.
Charge them that are rich Citi|zens,
and in their Thousands, that
they lay no weake Foundation, no
three halfe-penny Foundation, but
be bountifull to pious vses, to the
poore, and to the Ministery of the

Citie, that they take away the
scandall of the times, and vpbray|ding
of the Romish Penninuah,
against the Anna of our times:
Let the Hospitall, Widdowes and
Orphanes, taste of their bountie;
with such Sacrifices (if they come
from Faith and a good Consci|ence)
God is pleased. Bid them
not trust in the shaddow of siluer
and gold, which will wither as Io|nahs
Gourd; but in thy shelter.
Goe home with them this day, I
inuite thee to their Table; if I had
liberty (as they say it's a courtesie
for the Preacher to inuite a guest,)
Conscience, thou shouldest be my
guest. Deferre not till to morrow,
lest businesse hinder thee. This day
reckon and walke with them, and
talke with them: Bid them lay a|side
all  Bookes, and rec|kon
 and often recko|ning
will make you friends.
Be at their elboes when they

vse false weights and Ballances,
and giue them priuie nips: let the
mutuall profit of Buyer and Seller
be the rule of buying and selling,
and not the gaine of the one of
them alone. Assure them that are
hourders by fraud, that they hatch
as the Hen, the Partriges Egge,
that hath wings and will flie away;
and that they heape vp wrath a|gainst
the day of wrath, and are in
the meane time selfe-condemned;
whereas thou wouldst make them
rich, and adde no sorrow, nor
grauelly greet in their mouth, but
such gaine as will stand with con|tent
and selfe-sufficiencie.
If thou meetest with Simonai|call
Patrons, tell them, they and
their money shall perish: for selling
thee and the Soules of the people.
I haue not, as Ezechiel, a Map
of the Citie, but thou knowest all
the lurking Dennes, Stewes, and
infinite Bookes. I send thee to

preach and cry vnto them.
Roare and thunder in the eares
of the roaring Boyes, of all the
swaggering Crue, and tell them
they must for all these come to
Iudgement.
To the Fashion-mongers, both
the statelier sort, and the light-headed
yellow-banded Fooles, tell
the one, that the richest lining and
inside, is a good Conscience: And
for the other, if thou wilt vouch|safe,
tell them, that plaine apparell
and a good Conscience, will doe
them more honour, then all these
Apes-toyes.
As for the Players, and sesters,
and Rimers, and all that rable|ment,
tell them, thou wilt one day
be in earnest with them,  though
thou suffer them to personate thee
vpon their Stages, and shew their
wit, and breake their Iests on thee
now, thou wilt owe it them, till
they come vpon the great Stage,

before God, and all the world:
Where my sides, memorie, and
knowledge faile, adde, enlarge, and
apply: Print it in the hearts of as
many as thou canst, and the Lord
grant thee Grace and Audience in
their eares, that they may suffer the
words of Exhortation, and so I end
with the Prayer after my Text,
which is like a rich garment, that
hath facing, gards, and seluage of it
owne.
The God of peace, that brought a|gaine
from the dead our Lord Iesus, the
great Shpheard of the Sheep, through
th bood of the euerlasting couenant,
make you perfect in all good workes,
to  his will, c.
 O Lord, that hast won|der
 planted and formed our
Concinces within vs, that onely
know stand searchest our Consci|ences,
hat hast thy Chaire in the
Heauens,  onely art able to teach
them,  purifie them. Thou which

woundedst, and healedst 3000. at
one Sermon, whose hand is not
shortned: stretch out thine arme,
 doe the like in these latter times.
Forgiue the Sinnes against thee
and our Consciences, and the fre|quent
checkes of it and thy Spirit.
Ouertbrow the man of Sinne,
that Tyrant and Vsurper of Con|science.
Mollifie and enlighten the obsti|nate
Consciences of the Iewes,
Turkes, and Pagans.
Illuminate and sanctifie all Chri|stian
Princes, especially our Soue|raigne,
and ill the royall treasure
of his Conscience full of excellent
comfort: and that he may as much
excell in Conscience all other
Kings of the Earth, as hee doth in
Science, without all comparison.
Comfort the aflicted, direct the
doubtfull and scrupulous, and re|moue
all snares and scandals of
weake Consciences, which thou

hast not planted, and which thou
knowest are not for the peace of
thy Sion.
The grace of our Lord Iesus
Christ, and the loue of God our
Father, and the comfortable fel|lowship
of the Holy-Ghost, and
the peace of a good Con|science,
be with you all
now and euer.
Amen.

TO THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE
S^r. FRANCIS BACON
Knight, Lord Chancelor
of England, c.
_WHen wee see one goe or
doe amisse, though his
feete or hands bee the
next actors and instru|ments
of his errour: yet
wee say not, Are you lame? but, Haue
you no eyes? or Can you not see? What
euer sweruings or stumblings any part of
the holy politique maks, the blame lights
not vpon the Gentry or Comminalty, the
immediate delinquents, but on the prin|cipall
lights in Magistracy or Ministry,

which being as Guardiants and Tutors of
the rest, should either preuent or reforme
their aberrations. And herein miserable
is the condition of these two opticke pee|ces,
that they are more subiect, and that
to more distempers then other inferiour
parts: yet heerein more, that being hurt,
they are more impatient of cure; not only
of searching acrimonous waters (which
yet oft are needefull) but shie of the most
soft and lawny touches: but most of all in
this, that being once extinct, they leaue a
voyd darkenesse to the whole body, expo|sing
it to the pits of destruction. As ex|ceeding
great on the other hand, is the
happines, honor  vse of them, if cleere
and single. For this our Nationall body,
it will little boot either to applaude the
one, or to bewaile the other: I rather wish
nd looke about mee for some eye-salue,
which may helpe to descry and redresse, if
any thing be amisse. And behold heere
(Right Honourable) a confection promi|sing
something thereto: It was prescribed
first by Iethro, whom Moses calls the

eyes of Israel, Num. 10. 31. And newly
compounded by an Oculist, of whom as I
may not, so I need not say any thing at all.
Next vnder the sacred Fountaine of
light (the light of our Israel) I worthily
accompt your Lordship most sufficient in
law to accept, to make vse, to iudge, to pa|tronize
it. The subiect of the book is the
principall obiect of your Office, to elect,
direct and correct inferiour Magistracy.
To which purposes, Nature, Literature
and Grace haue inabled you, that if you
should faile the worlds expectation, they
will hardly trust any other in hast. Many
in rising haue followed the stirrop, pam|pered
and letting honor not standing the
ground, but once seated haue done re|nownedly.
But your Lordship had neuer
any other graces them your birth and de|sert;
to which, hereditary dignity hath
so gently tendred it selfe, that you haue
not let fal your name of religion in getting
vp. Therefore now you are in the top of
honour, all that know you looke you will
be exactly honourable. For my part,

bounden to your Lordship for a fauour
formerly receiued, greater then your Ho|nour
knowes of, or I can expresse: I shall
leaue Iethro to be your Montoir, and my
self remaine euer an humble suitor to God,
who hath made you a Iudge of conscience,
that he would make you continue a con|scionable
Iudge, improouing your place
 abilities to the best aduantage belong|ing
to it, the furtherance of your recko|ning
at the last day.
Your Honours daily
Beadsman,
NATH. WARD.






EXOD. 18. 21. 22. 23.
Moreouer, thou shalt prouide out of all the
people able men, such as feare God, men
of truth, hsing couetousnesse, and place
such ouer them, to ee rulers of thousands,
and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and
rulers of tens.
And let them iudge the people at all seasons:
and it shall be that euery great matter they
shall bring vnto thee, but euery small matter
they shal iudge: so shal it  easier for thy selfe,
and they shal beare the burthen with thee.
If thou doe this thing, and God command thee
so, then thou shalt be able to endure,  al this
people shall also goe to their place in peace.

_IF Iethro were, as the
fashion of those times,
and the Nature of
his stile will beare,
and (as some con|ceipt)
both Prince and Priest;Cohen. then

was hee beyond all exception, euery
way qualified; for skill, as a Iudicious
Diuine; and for experience, as an a|ged
Gouernour, to giue direction in
matters of Magistracy, and to cast Moses
a mold for a Policie in Israel. Sure
I am, a godly and religious man hee
was, for he begins with prayer and
ends with sacrifice. And such as him|selfe,
was his aduise, sage and holy.
And howsoeuer it passed from him at
the first vnder Gods correction, yet
afterward allowed by God and pra|ctised
by Moses, becomes of good po|licie,
sound diuinity; of priuate coun|sell,
a generall oracle: ruling for the
substance of it, all ages and persons.
 Venerable it is for the very antiqui|ty
of it. What price doe men set vpo~
old copies,. gnat. ad Mrian Cassob. coynes and Statues: who
passeth by a christall fountaine be|ring
some ancient name or date, and
tastes not of it, though no thirst pro|uokes
him? Such is this, the cleare
head-spring of al ensueing brookes in

Scripture  other  concer|ning
Magistracy. All those texts
(which I wish were set as a frontlet
betweene the eyes  as a seale vpon
the harts of al in authority Iehosaphats
charge, 2 Chro. 16. 5. Iob his character,
cha. 29. Dauids vow, Psas. 101. The scat|tered
Parables of Salomon,  passages
of the Prophets, cheefly that round 
smart one Isai. 33. 14. are they not all
branches of this root? In which re|spect
it must needes be of souaraigne
vse for the discouering and reforming
of whatsoeuer error time hath soyled
gouerment withall. How are defa|ced
copies and disfigured pictures
better amended, then by reducing
them to their originall? if the pipe
faile, goe we not to the head?
Heere is the Archetype or first 
draught of Magistracy, worthily in
this regard chosen by Iudicious Bucr
to presse vpon Edward the sixt, for the
purgation of his offices and Lawes,
from the drosse and filth contracted

vnder the  confusion: which
considering, that worthy Iosiah of
ours tooke in such good part, and
practised with such good successe.
Yea, Moses himselfe learned in al
good litterature, trained vp in Court,
the greatest Law giuer that euer was,
and father of all Law-giuers, of the
thrice great Hermes, Lycurgus, Solon.
Plato, Iustinian,  the rest. Yea, Gods
familiar fauorite, faithfull in his house,
knowne by name and face, honoured
with miraculous power, c. And
that at the hands of one (age and fa|therhood
excepted) his inferiour. I
trust that none will dare to reiect or
sleight it of, remembring that Diuini|ty,
as the mistresse taketh vpon her to
direct her hand-mayd, and that the
Scripture is the best man of counsell
for the greatest Statesman in the
world: This little portion therof con|taining
in it more then all Lipsius his
Bee-hiue, or Machiauels Spider-web. All
which will best appeare by the ope|ning

of this rich cabinet, and viewing
the seuerall Iewels in it, which are
these.
The parts of the Text.Diuision.
It first giues order for the care and 
circumspection in the choyce,
Prouide.
Secondly, it directs this choyce by
foure essentiall characters of Magi|strates.

1. Men of ability.
2. Fearing God.
3. Men of truth.
4. Hating couetousnesse.

Thirdly, it applies these foure to 
Magistrates of all degrees, in an exact
distribution of them, by way of gra|dation
ascending step by step, from
the highest to the lowest. And place
such ouer them to be rulers. 1. of thou|sands.
2. of hundreds. 3. of fifties.
4. of tens.
Fourthly, it prescribes to the Ma|gistrates,
thus qualified and chosen,
their offices; viz. to iudge the people

in the smaller causes, c. and their
assiduity and industry therein. And
let them iudge the people at all seasons,
c. And it shall be that they shall bring
euery great matter to thee, but euery
small matter they shall iudge.
Lastly, it propounds the blessed
fruit  emolument that will necessa|rily
ensue thereupon. First to Moses
himselfe, So shall it be easier for thy selfe,
and they shall beare the burthen with
thee, and thou shalt bee able to endure.
Secondly, to the people, And all this
people shall goe to their place in peace.
 The first poynt, Techezeh, Prouide,
or looke out. A word implying all
exactnesse and curiosity incident to
elections,Circumspe|ction. as Inspection, circumspection,
inquisition, suspition, information, deli|beration,
comming of Chozah, to see
or contemplate, whence the Prophets
were called Chosi, Seers. It is in a man|ner
translated by a word of the like
force in a businesse of the like nature
Acts 6. 5. , suruey the whole

body of the people,  chuse the best
you can cull out. It were somewhat
strict and strange to say, that Prayer
and fasting must be vsed: And yet this
I finde practised in such cases, Acts 1.
and Numb. 27. 16. Let the Lord God
of the spirits of all flesh set a man ouer this
Congregation. Yea, Iethro himselfe
sanctified this his aduice with a pray|er,
verse 19. God be with thee. And
good reason hee should be called to
counsell whose the iudgement is, and
whose prouidence is alwayes very
speciall in those elections, whether
sought or no.1 Samuel 19. If God supravise not,
Samuel the Seer shall take seauen
wrong before one right. Some mens
faults are palpable, and goe before e|lection,
som are cunningly concealed
and breake not out till after. First,
therefore looke vp to God, and then
amongst the people, haue thine eyes
in thy head, all the care that may bee
will be little enough. Say not there
are no sufficient persons, nor yet think

euery one that thinkes himselfe so, or
commonly goes for such, is suffici|ent:
seeke out such, and such may be
found. Looke amongst the Oliues,
Vines, and Flg-trees: such trees must
be climbed. Brambles will lay holde
on the sleeue for preferment. Ne sit
qui ambit. Let him neuer speed that
sues. Lay hands on none rashly. They
that are fit  able, must and will bee
sought to; yea, haled out of their ease
 priuacy into the light of employ|ment:
the charge  danger wherof
they waighing, as wel as the credit, or
gaine, and knowing them to bee cal|lings,
will not meddle with them, till
they be called to them. Which am|bitious
Inconsiderates not being able
to ponder, much lesse to sustaine,
thrust their shoulders vnder, and ei|ther
by hooke or crooke come in, or
climbe into the chaire of honor, more
tickle then the stoole Eli brake his
necke off: whither when they haue
aspired with much trauaile and cost

they fit as in the top of a mast in feare
and hazard, and often fall with shame
 confusion. Not vnlike to some rash
youth, that hauing gotten an horse as
wilde as himselfe, with much a doe
backes him, sits him in a sweat, and
comes downe with a mischeefe.
For the preuention of all which e|uils 
vnauoidably attending ambition,
lighting partly vpon the intruders,
themselues, partly vpon the admit|ters,
but most heauily vpon the com|mon
weale, see how needeful Iethro's
counsell was and euer will bee; That
such be prouided, not as would haue
places, but as places should haue.
Which care, as Iethro commits to
Moses, so both the Scripture and rea|son
imposeth vpo~ the superiour Ma|gistrate,
in whose power and place, it
s either to nominate or constitute in|feriour
Authorities: and whose fault
cheefly it is, if they be otherwise then
they ought, or the people iniured in
this kinde. How circumspect and

religious ought such to be, in the per|formance
of this greatest and waigh|tiest
duty.
 Vnlesse you will reply, as I feare
many a Fox doth in his bosome;
Thus indeede you haue heard it sayd
of olde, but those times were plaine,
and Iethro a simple meaning olde
man. A beaten Politician of our
times, learned in the wisdom of new|er
state,  acquainted with the my|steries
of the market, that knows how
to improue things to the best, for his
owne time and turne, and to let the
common body shift for it selfe, would
haue proiected Moses a farre more
commodious plot, after this or the
like manner: Now you haue offices
to bestow, a faire opportunity in your
hand, to mae your selfe for euer, to
raise your house, to pleasure your
friends, eiehr proclamime it openly
or secretly, set it abroach by some
meanes or other, see who bids fairest,
waigh the sacrifices, chuse the men of

the best and greatest gifts.
Oh gall of bitternesse! oh root of 
all euill to Church and Common-wealth,
when authorities and offices
of Iustice shall be bought and solde,
as with a trumpet or drum to the can|dle
or outrope.Tanqum sub+asta. The particlar bran|ches
whereof, when I seriously consi|der,
I wonder not that Christ with
sch zealous seuerity brake down the
bankes, and whipt out the chapmen
ut of the Temple: nor that Peter
with such fiery indignation banned
Simon and his money. For if such
en  money perish not, Kingdoms
and Churches must perish, and both
Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall Courts will
soone prooue dens of theeues.
Whose soule bleedes not to see 
mens soules bought and solde, like
sheep at the market to euery butcher;
of this you Lawyers uch complain
against the Clergy men, for bying of
enefices: which you might doe the
more iustly, if your selues were not

often the sellers of them. I would the
fault rested onely in benefices, and
reached not into offices and ciuill
dignities. Indeede that kinde of pur|chase
we cal not simony, it may from
his other name be fitlier stiled magick,
for by I know not what kinde of
witch-craft, men sinne by leaue and
law in these ciuill purchases. The
lawes and statutes prouided for the
remedie of the euil in som cases, tole|rating
it in other, and the practise by
meanes of this allowance growing in|tolerable.
Some of the~ (as the world
reports) offices for life  at pleasure,
amounting to the rate of lands and
inheritances.
 I am not Ignorant of the distincti|on
of Iudicature, trust and paines; but
are they not all offices of Iustice? doe
they not prepare to Iudicate, and
lies it not in them to guide or mis|guide,
to hasten or delay Iustice, c.
which how can they freely giue,
which buy dearely.

Doth not Bucer deale faithfully 
with his Soueraigne? Offices are not
liuings and salaries, but charges and
duties: not preferments for fauou|rites;
but rewards of deserts, c.
Doth Iulius, ustinianus, or Theodosius
their lawes giue allowance to any?
See then how prouide~tly Iethro pro|uides
against this Hemlock-root of
Iustice? out of whose prouiso I con|clude
that which Augustine saw in his
time, and deere experience confirmes
in others:Aug. lib. 10. de . Dei. cap. 14. That such as prouid them|selues
places, and are not prouided
for them; come into them, and exe|cute
them, not with a minde of doing
good, but domineering; not of pro|uiding
for others welfare, but for
their owne turnes. Le vs pray, that if
it be possible this fault may bee for|giuen
and amended.
And not this onely; but another 
neere of kinde to this,Generality. met withall in
the very next clause of my text, A|mong
all the People (Mical Hagnam)

Where Iethro restraines not Moses to
his owne Familie, to any particular
Tribe, or to the richer sort: but re|quires
this freedome, as well as the
former circumspection. Generality
and impartiality being requisite to
the good being of a choyce: and limi|tation
and restraint the very banes of
Election; yea, contradictions to it.
As if one should say, you shall chuse
amonst twenty, but you shall chuse
this or that on: Doth he not in effect
say you shall not haue your choyce?
will a man when hee goes to Market
be confined to any shop or stall, if hee
meane to prouide the best? How
grossely is the countrey wronged 
befooled, cheefly in the choyse of
such, as into whose hands they put
their liues and lands at Parliaments,
by a kinde of Conge defliers, vsually
sent them by some of the Gentry of
the shires, perswading (if not prescri|bing)
the very cople they must chuse.
Thus haue we seen Naturalls tied to a

poste with a straw, which they durst
not breake.
This text bids you know and stand 
fast in your lawfull liberties of electi|on,
which that you may not abuse, I
come to the second part of the Text.

The second Part.
It teacheth you how to order and 
direct it by these foure markes fol|lowing:
which Ireckon as foure sup|porters
of the throne of Iustice, not
altogether vnlike to those foure in
Christs throne, so often me~tioned in
the old and new Testament, which
being properties of Angels, are sym|bolls
both of Magistrates and Mini|sters.
These foure whosoeuer is com|pounded 
of, is a man after Gods own
heart, and a starre in his right hand.
Hee that wants any of them, is but a
blazing comet, how high soeuer hee
seemes to soare. These will not onely
serue for the triall of such as are Can|didati,
and to bee chosen: but also of

such as are inuested and already in
place to approoue or reprooue their
condition. And for this end and pur|pose,
let vs vse them this day, as foure
waights of the Sanctuary, whereunto
whatsoeuer Officer heere present,
from the Iudges to the Bayliffes, shall
not answer: This Text (as the hand|writing
on the wall) shall say vnto
him from God; Thou art waighed in
the ballance,  found too light, and
thine Office (at least ought to be) ta|ken
from thee.

The first Character or weight
Abilitie.
The first and prime marke is Abili|tie
(Anishi Chaijl). So our new tran|slation
expresseth it well in a compre|hensiue
word, and so I finde it in
Scripture signifying and comprising
all the seueralls that belong to facul|tie
or abilitie: whereof I number first
three complementall for convenien|cie;
secondly, three substantiall and
of necessitie.

First Chaijl includes strength of bo|dy 
and manhood,Strength. such as inableth
hem for riding, going, sitting, watch|ng,
 industrious execution of their
: Such as the scripture com|mends
in Caleb at fourescore and fiue,
nd stories in Vespatian, our Alfred,
Hardicanutus, Ironsides, c.
Which our straight buttoned, car|pet 
and effeminate Gentry,Wealth. wanting,
annot indure to hold out a forenoon
 afternoone sitting without a To|acco
baite, or a game at Bowles, or
ome such breathing to refresh their
bodies and mindes, little acquainted
with the tediousnes of wise and seri|ous
businesse: Woe to the people (saith
Salomon) whose Princes are children
and eate in the morning; and blessed are
he people whose Gouernors eate in time
and for strength. Eccles. 10.
Secondly, neither is wealth to be
excluded: That Diana of the world,
which it onely accounts Abilitie, and
calls it opes  potentia, which yet is

better called value then valour, yet
may it concurre to make vp that
which our Law terme calls mieulx
vailiant; and though at the beame of
the Sanctuary money makes not the
man, yet it adds some mettall to the
man.
 And besides there is some vse of
these rappings to the common sort,
Ad populum phaleras, which taught
Agrippa to come to the Iudgement
seat with pompe, state, and atten|dance
like that of our Sheriffs not to
be neglected, as that which procures
some terror and awe in the people:
which Alexander well aduised of, left
his Gigantique armour behinde him
among the Indians, and vsed more
state then at Greece.
 Yet remembring that these com|plements
without the substance are
but empty gulls and scarbuggs of ma|iestie,
the Sophistry of gouernment, as
one calls them: and as Zachary the
Prophet saith, the instruments of a

foolish Gouernour. And such as Ie|remie
derides in Shallum the sonne of
Iosia,Ierem, 22. 14. Thinkest thou to rule because of
thy large building, Cedar seeling, painted
with vermilian, did not thy Father pro|sper
when he did execute iudgment and
Iustice? which is indeed the truth 
substance, th'other but the flourish.
Thirdly, I exclude not birth and 
blood,Birth. which many times conveyes
spirit  courage with it, Blessed is the
Land whose Princes are the sonnes of
Nobles.Eccles. 10. 17. Eagles produce Eagles, and
Crowes Crauens, yet regeneration
 education often corrects this rule:
and experience tells vs, That cottages
and ploughs haue brought forth as
able men for the gowne  sword, as
Pallaces and Scepters.Iudg. 6. 19 Gideon came
out of the poorest of the familie of
Manasse, and he the least in his fathers
house, a poore thresher. Dauid was
taken from the sheepefold c. yet
both mighty men of valour, and
speciall Sauiours of their people: and

the wisdome of some of our neigh|bour
Natio~s is much to be commen|ded
in this, that if they discerne an
excellent spirit  facultie in any man,
they respect not his wealth, or birth,
or profession, but chuse him into
their Magistracie and weighty im|ployments.
 But these three are but of the by
and well being,1 Wisdome and experi|ence. the three following of
the maine  essentiall to Magistracy,
all comprised vnder the word Chal,
as first wisdome and experience, which
the Preacher tels vs is better then
stre~gth,ceies. 9. 16. either of body or estate. And
of this abilitie Moses expounds this
word in his practise, Deutr. 1. 15.
which is a good Commentary vpon
his fathers aduice.
 And indeede without this what is
a Magistrate,Monstrum cui lumen ademp|tum. but a blinde Polyphemus,
or a monster without an eye. If hee
want either skil in the lawes, or obser+uation
of his owne, must hee not bee
tutored by his Clarke, as it often falls

out? or shall hee not bee misled by
some Counsellor, crossed  contra|dicted
by euery stander by, that shall
tell him this you cannot do by Law,
or I take it you are besids your book.
The second is strength of mind, to 
gouerne and manage passion and vn|ruly
affections,2 Modera|tion of minde, or equanimity which he that weilds
at will, is stronger then hee that sub|dues
a city and conquers a Kingdom,
to beare and forbeare, and to order
the mutinous perturbations of the
minde, is that abilitie which the Gre|cians
call .
Very requisite in a Iudge, who must 
not suffer his affection to disquiet his
iudgement and vnderstanding, in ri|sing
at the first complaint; nor at any
accident or present miscarriage of ei|ther
party, suddenly occasioned,
which is collaterall to the cause, and
impertinent to the question, but hee
must bee patient and meeke towards
their personall weakenesse. Likewise
long-minded, to endure the rusticity

and homelinesse of common people
in giuing euidence after their plaine
fashion and faculty, in time, and mul|titude
of words, happily with some
absurdities of phraise or gesture, nor
impatient towards their foolish affe|cted
eloquent termes, nor any thing
else whereby the truth of their tale
may be ghessed at.
 Lastly and principally, I vnder|stand
with the Geneua translation,Courage or Magnani|mity.
that fortitude, valour and magnani|mity,
which we call courage and spi|rit;
typified in Iudah the Law-giuing
Tribe, whose emblem or scutchion
was the Lyon Couchant, that sits or
lies by the prey without feare of re|scue,
that turnes not his head at the
sight of any other creature, Prou. 30.
which Salomon symbolized in the
steps of his throne adorned with Ly|ons:
The Athenian Iudges by sitting
in Mars-street. Some thinke that from
this vertue Constantine was termed
Reucl. 12. the Churches male or man|child:

others apply it to Luther: o|thers
to Christ, the true Lyon of Iuda
And though I regard not the Salick 
Law, because the God of spirits hath
often put great spirits into that sex;
yet I mislike not Theodorets obseruati|on
vpon that in Leuiticus, . where the
Ruler for his sin is enioyned to offer
an hee goat, the priuate man a shee|goat.
The male suits the Ruler best,
and the female the ruled.
This ability is so requisite, that it is 
often put for the onely qualitie, as if
this alone would serue, as in Moses
charge to Ioshua, and Dauids to Salo|mon.
And experience hath taught,
that where this one hath abouuded,
though the other haue been wanting
in some Magistrates: they haue done
more good seruice to their Country,
then many others who haue had
som tolerable measure of the rest, but
haue failed onely in this.
Had not the principall posts of an 
house need to be of hart of oake? are

rulers  standarts that regulate othe
measures, to bee made of soft wood
or of lead, that will bend and bow
pleasure? doe men chuse a startin
horse to leade the teeme? had no th
neede be of Dauids valour, and Sansons
courage that must take the 
out of the Lyons mouth, and rescu
the oppressed from the man that 
too mighty for him? had not he nee
to be of some spirit and resolution
that must neglect the displeasure and
ownes, reiect the letters and suits o
great men and superiours?
 It is incredible to those that kne
it not, what strength great men wil
put to (especially if once interested
for the vpholding of a 'rotten Ale
house, countenancing of a disordere
retainer, c, the resistance whereof 
quires it not some spirit? had not th
braine neede to be of a strong consti|tution,
that must dispell and dispers
the fumes ascending from a corrupliuer,
stomacke, or spleene? I mean

the clamorous, rumours, and some|times
the flatteries of the vulgar,
which often intoxicate able men, and
make them as weake as water, yeel|ding
and giuing as Pilate, when hee
heard but a buze that he was not Cae|sars
friend, and saw that in dismissing
Christ, he should displease the Iewes.
What heroycal spirit had he neede 
haue, that must encounter the Hydra
of sinne, oppose the current of times,
and the torrent of vice, that must
urne the wheele ouer the wicked;
especially such roaring monsters, and
rebellious Chora's such lawlesse sons
of Belial; wherwith our times swarm,
who sticke not to oppose with crest
and brest, whosoeuer stand in the way
of their humours ad lusts? Surely, if
lethro called for courage in those mo|dest
primitiue times, and among a
people newly tamed with Aegyptian
okes: what doe our adacious and
fore-headlesse Swaggerers require?
our lees and dregs of time; not vnlike

to those wherein God was faine to
raise vp extraordinary Iudges, to smi
hip and thigh, c. What Atlas shall
support the state of the ruinous and
tottering world, in these perilous ends
of time?
 For all these fore-named purposes,
how vnapt is a man of a soft, timo|rous,
and flexible nature? for whom
it is as possible to steere a right course
without sweruing to the left hand or
right, for feare or fauour, as it is for a
cock-boat to keep head against wind
and tide, without helpe of oares or
sailes: experience euer making this
good, that cowards are slaues to their
superiours, follow-fooles to their e|quals,
tyrants to their inferiours, and
winde-mills to popular breath, not
being able to any of these to say so
much as no.
 Wherfore this text proclames and
speakes, as Gedeon in the eares o
all the faint-hearted. Whosoeuer i
fearefull and timorous, let him depart

from mount Gilead, and there depar|ted
twenty thousand;Iudg. 7. 3. and yet God
the second time, out of the remnant,
viz. ten thousand, defaulks all the la|zie
persons, and reduced that huge
army to three hundred able persons.
It were excellent for the Co~mon-wealth,
if such a substraction might
bee made: and the weake-hearted
would resigne their roomes to able
men. For what haue seruile cowards
to doe with the sword of the Lord,
and Gedeon, with God and the Kings
offices.
On the contrary, it sayth to all men 
of ablity, as the Angell to Gedeon,
The Lord is with thee thou mighty man
of valour, goe on in this thy might to saue
Israel, c. What is our office that
are Ministers, but as Gods Trumpet|ters
and Drummers to encourage,
hearten  put life in those that fight
his battles and doe his worke. By the
vertue then of this my text, I say to
euery good-hearted Magistrate, pro|ceede

and goe on from strength to
strength.
 And if any aske mee, who then is
sufficient for these things? or where
shall we get this strength, that are but
flesh and bloud, and men as others? I
answere with Iob,Iob 28. Siluer hath his veine,
and gold his mine where it is found, i 
is taken out of the earth, and brasse moul|te
out of the stone, but the place of this
ability is not to be found in the land
of the liuing. Nature saith it is not to
be found in me, Wealth and Honor
sayes not in me: It is fals ly said of
Cato and Fabricius, that the Sun might
sooner be stayed or altered in his race
then they in the course of Iustice. The
stouest nd the richest wil yeeld. But
Dauid tlls his sonne Salomon on his
death-bed, where hee shall finde it.
The O , is greatnesse and power,
 the head of all riches; honor and
 hands, it is in thee to
, c. This God hath taught
Dauid to breake a bow of steele with

his hands: It is hee that looseth the
coller of Princes, girdeth their loines,
 vngirdeth them again, befooles the
Counsellor, the Iudge  the spokes|man:
He it was that made the shooes
of Ioseph as strong as brasse, Ieremiah
as a wall of brasse, Calch as strong at
fourescore and fiue as at forty; if
Sampsons haire be off, and God depar|ed
from him, he is s other men, and
he can strengthen him againe without
his lockes at his pleasure.
If any man want wisdome or 
strength, let him pray, and hee can
make him wiser then the children of
the East, and stronger then the Ana|kins:
wherefore bee strong in the
Lord, faint not, be not weary of well-doing,
for feare of opposition and
crossing: though in rowing this ship,
the windes blow, and the seas rage,
Christ can straight send and Halcion,
and set it on shore.
It is the fault of many Christian Ma|gistrates,
euer to be complaining and

groning vnder the burthen: as if ease
and dilicacie were to be sought for in
gouernment. What if there be a Ly|on
in the way? the righteous is bol|der
then the Lyon: what if thou bee
weake? is not God strength? and doth
not hee perfect his strength in our
weaknesse? what if there be many op|posites
in the way? true courage is
strong as death,Cant.  and will trample all
vnder feete without resistance.
 Yea, but what if an host come a|gainst
thee, and as Bees encompasse
thee? true faith sees more on Gods
side then against him, euen guards of
Angels, as plainely as men doe the
Sheriffs halberts, and doubts not, but
in the name of the Lord to vanquish
them all.
 One concluding place for all, out
of a Preachers mouth,Eccles 7. 14. that knew what
he said, wisdome strengthens one man
more then twenty mighty Potentats
that are in a city, he that feareth God
shall come foorth of all dangers.

Whence by way of passage, note that
the next point of the feare of God, is
that which giueth life to the fore-go|ing,
and to the two following also:
and is placed in the text, as the heart
in the body, for conueying life to al
the parts; or as a dram of muske, per|fuming
the whole box of oyntment.


Fearing God.
Iethro must be vnderstood not of the
poore bastardly slauish feare,The second Character. which
depraued nature hath left in all: nor 
of any sdden flash of feare wrought
by word or workes, such as Foelix,
Balshazzar Caligula were not voyd
of, and yet neuer the better Magi|strates:
But such a filiall feare, as faith
and the assurance of Gods loue and
saluation breeds; such as awed Ioseph,
Cornelius, Dauid, c. This is the feare
required by Iethro,  quae parit
, godlines which breedeth an
heedfulnesse in all our wayes and
actions.
Without this feare of God, what is 

ability but the Diuels anuile, wheron
he forgeth  hammereth mischiefe?
what is wisdome but subtilty? what
is courage vnsanctified, but iniustice?
wherin is such skill in the lawes com|monly
employed, but in colouring
and couering bad causes and persons,
 in making the lawes a nose of wax
to priuate ends? other men haue o|ther
bits and restraints, but men in
authority, if they feare not God, haue
nothing else to feare. Wherefore
Christ ioynes the~ well in the vnrigh|teous
Iudge, that hee feared neither
God nor man. If hee be a simple
coward, he feares all men, if a man of
ability, he feares none at all.
 What are the nerues and sinewes
of all gouernment, the bondes and
co~mands of obedience, but an oath?
and what are oaths to propha~e men,
but as Sampsons cords, which he
snapt asunder, as fast as they were of|fered
him. The common sort of our
people count the oaths that men take

when they take offices, no other then
formall: so they distinguish them (a
strange distinction) from other oaths
of contract, and dally with them ac|cordingly.
They discerne God no more in 
oaths, then Christ in the Sacrame~ts:
and therefore take them, and breake
them rashly and regardlesly, which
when they haue done, the Diuell en|ters
into them, as into Iudas;  runs
them headlong into all periurd cour|ses:
which makes the land to mourne
for the contempt of oathes, and neg|lect
of duties. What is the ground of
all fidelity to King  Countrey, but
religio~? welfare Constantinus his max|ime,
He cannot be faithfull to mee, that
is vnfaithfull to God. Why then, what
are oathes for Athests and Papists, o|ther
then collers for monkies neckes,
which lip the~ at their pleasure? such
neither are nor can be good subiects:
muchlesse good Magistrates.. Papists
wil keepe no faith with Protestants,

let Protestants giue no trust to papists
though they swear vpon al the books
in the World.Nulla sides ha|ben da papistis 
 Finally, what is the principal scope
of Magistracy in Gods intention,
whose creature and ordinance it is;
but to promote his glory, countenan|cing
the Gospell  the Professours
of it, safe-gard of the Church and
Common-wealth, the first  second
table,  principally the two former.
Now for all these, cheefly for the
cheefest, what cares a Cato or a Gallio,
who beares the sword in vaine for
God and his ends; who neuer minds
any thing but his owne Cabinet, or
the ship of the Common-wealth at
the best: for the other, sincke they
swim they, all is one to him, he tooke
no charge, nor will he take notice of
them.
 Wherefore I conclude, that the
feare of God is the principall part, as
of my Text, so of a good Magistrate,
whom Christ calls a Ruler in Israel,

Paul Gods Minister and sword-bea|rer:Io 3. Rom. 13.
yea, the very forme and soule of
such an one: yea, it troubles mee to
make it, but a part which Salomon cals
the whole of a man,Eccles 12. 13. especially such a
man who is sent of God,1 Pet. 2. for the praise
of the godly, and the punishment of
euill doers. In which respect being
the maine of my Text, giue me leaue
to giue you a short character of such a
Magistrate, as this quality will make
him, where euer it is found in any
good latitude.
Hee is one that came into his place
by Gods doore, and not by the Di|uels 
window: when he is in, he eyes
him that is inuisible, euen God in the
assembly of Gods: and therefore sits
on the Iudgement seat in as great,
though not in so slauish a feare of of|fending,
as Olanes vpon the flead skin
of his father Sylannes, nayled by Cam|byses
on the Tribunall: or as a Russian
Iudge that feares the boiling caldron,
or open battocking: or the Turkish Se+nate,

when they think the great Turke
to stand behind the Arras, at the dan|gerous
doore.
 Who hath alwaies, (as God enioy|neth,
Deutro. . 18.) a copy of the
law of his God before him, and reads
it all the dayes of his life, that he may
learne to feare the Lord his God, and
to keep the Co~mandement without
turning aside, either to the right hand
or left.
 If at all he be glad of his place, it is
not as a chaire of honour, or frame
of commodity, nor sword of reueng:
but only as a meane of furthering his
reckoning, and pleasuring his Coun|trey.
For his oath, he remembers it,
and trembles, lest if carlesly he trans|gresse
it, the winged flying booke o|uertake
him before he get home: if he
cut but the skirt or lap of Iustice, his
heart smites him with a priuy pinch,
till he sets all right againe with God
and man. Hee dares not so much as
by countenance offend any of Gods

little ones, nor afford a good looke
to a varlet, nor yet so to respect their
persons, s to wrong their cause, for
he knowes all these to be abhomina|tion
to his Lord, into whose hands he
dreads to fall as knowing him a con|suming
fire, and one that hath proui|ded
Tophet for Princes. When an vn|lawfull
suit is commenced by power
or by friendship, his heart answers
(if not his tongue) with Iob: How shal
I doe this, and answer God when hee
comes to iudgement.
As for bribes, hee dares not looke 
on them, lest they blinde his eyes be|fore
he beware: such pitch he dares
not touch, nor receiue into his bo|some,
lest it defile him in the open
sunne, if tendered in closet or cham|ber,
he feares the timber  stones in
the wall would be witnesses against
him
When he comes in court, he fixeth 
his ey, neither before him on that
person, nor about him on the behol|ders,

nor behind him for bribes,Summboni Iudicis est ne respicere, ne circumspicere. sed supicere. Ferus in Iob. 5. 30. but
vpward on God: generally conside|ring
that Christ is Lord Paramont of
all courts of iustice, and that now his
father hath resigned all iudgement in|to
his hands. Hee stewards all to his
content, promotes his profits with|out
wrong to the Tennant. Looks so
to the Church, that the Common-weale
receiue no detriment: and so to
the Common-wealth, as the Church
shall surely flourish: so countenan|cing
the seruants of God, that hee
wrong not the worst worldling:
maintaines piety, and neglects not e|quity:
keepes his house well, but
his Church better: in frequenting
whereof, he with his family are presi|dents
to all the hundreds where hee
dwells: And in a word, doth as much
good by his example, as by his autho|ritie.
This is the godly man, whom the
Lord chuseth and guideth, whose
praise and reward is of God: which

Dauid hauing found true in his life, a
little before his death, recordeth to al
ages.1 Sam. 23. 2. 3. 4. The spirit of the Lord spake by me,
and his word was in my tongue. The
God of Israel spake to me, the strength of
Israel sayd, thou shalt beare rule ouer
men, being iust, and ruling in the feare
of God. Euen as the morning light when
the sunne riseth, the morning, I say, with|out
clowds, so shall mine house be, and not
as the grasse of the earth is by the bright
raine. For God hath made with mee an
euerlasting couenant, perfect in all poynts
and sure.
Let the Diuell  the world storm 
and burst with enuy, one of these is
worth a thousand of the common
sort, though men will see no diffe|rence,
but say; Are not all honest and
sufficient men? Let men talke of their
quiet and peaceable neighbours, and
good house-keepers, good Common-wealths
men: though these be good
things, yet if religion com not in, as a
number to make them of some value,

they are but all as cyphers in Gods
account
 Now if God thinke so meanely of
these, who are either meere ciuil and
politique men, or idle pleasurable
Gentlemen, what reckoning doe we
thinke hee makes of such prophane
vncircumcised vice-gods (as I may in
the worst-sense best terme them) that
sell themselues to work wickednesse?
that giue themselues to all good fel|lowship
(as they call it) and to all ex|cesse
of riot (as the Apostle calls it)
and that hate to be reformed: such I
meane as hold religion a disparage|ment
to Gentry, and feare nothing
more, then to haue a name that they
feare God, who thinke when they
haue gotten an office, they may swear
by authority, oppresse by licence,
drinke and swill without controll.
 What shall I say of such? are these
Gods, and children of the most high,
or the charracters of his most holy I|mage?
Diuels are they rather, then

Deputies for him, Imps of his King|dome,
farre better becomming an
Ale-bench, then a Shire-bench, and
the barre, then  Iudgement seat.
But what shall I say to such mock-god-like
Esau's shall I take vp the
words of Moses: if thou wilt not feare
this glorious name, The Lord thy God,
I will make thy plagues wonderfull,
and of great continuance: Or those of
Dauid, which perhaps will fit them
better and these times of imminent
changes, They know not, and vnder|stand
nothing, they walke in darknes,
albeit the foundations of the earth be
mooued: I haue sayd ye are Gods, but
yee shall die like men, and fall like o|thers.
Or wil they suffer the Prophets
exhortation,Isa. 52. 8. 12. 13. who art thou that dread|est
a mortall man, whose breath is in
his nostrils, whom the moth shall eat
like a garment, and the worme like
wooll: And forgettest thy maker, that
hath spred the heauens, laid the foun|dations
of the earth, that giueth the

first and latter raine, that hath set the
bounds to the sea,Ier. 5. 22. 24 c. Or will they
heare Salomons end of all? Feare God,
that will bring euery secret to iudge|ment:
or a greater yet then Salomon,
Feare him that is able when he hath kil|led
the body, to destroy the soule also in
hell fire for euermore.
 Well, the Lord cause them to
heare, that hath planted the eare: and
plant his feare in their hearts where it
is not, increase it where it is, that there
may bee more holy Magistrates, and
that the holy may yet be more holy.
And then we hope the other two pro|perties
following will more abound,
and we shall spend the lesse time and
labour about them: For men fearing
God truely, will be also


Men of truth.
Without which,The third Cha|racter shew of religion
 is but lying vanity: a glorious profes|sion,
but plaine hypocrisie: And cou|rage,
if it bee not for the truth and in
the truth, is but either Thrasonicall

audacity, or wicked impudency. And
therefore this character added to the
former, ioynes those which are in the
forme of Iurates, and ought to bee in
all Offices, good men and true.
This stile, men of truth, admits two 
interpretations, both compatible with
the text and theme. A man of truth is
either a true Israelite, a true Nathaniel
voyd of guile, as truth is opposed to
hypocrisie,. or else a louer of the truth,
as truth is opposed vnto falshood.
One that in particular cases, suites, 
controuersies betweene man  man,
counts it his honour to sift out the
truth, maintaine the truth, stick to it,
not suffering himselfe to be misinfor|med
by Tale bearers, Prompters and
Sycophants: nor misled and peruer|ted
by the false pleading and colou|ring
of consciencelesse Counsellors:
But brings iudgement to the ballance
and rule of righteousnesse,  delights
(as the hound doth naturally in sen|ting
out the hare) to search and trace

out the truth, out of all the thickets
and dens of iuggling  conueyance,
labouring as much to boult it out by
examination in Hypothesi, as the philo|sophers
by disputations in Thes: be|ing
of his temper that worthily sayd,
Plato is my friend, Socrates my friend,
but the truth is my dearest friend.
Or like Iob,Iob 29. 26 who couered himselfe
with Iustice  to whom Iudgement
was as a robe  crowne, who when
he knew not the cause, sought it out
diligently.
 And for this purpose, a man of
truth keeps men of truth about him:
and with Dauid,Psal 101. 7. abandons all lyers
out of his houshold: whereas of a
Prince that harkneth to lies, all his
seruants are Liers. And of such Iu|stice,
which is in truth and for truth,
I say (as of old it was sayd) neither
the euening nor the morning star e|qualls
it in brightnesse.
 But withall, I must complaine as o
old, that truth is fallen in the streets,

and vtterly perished from among
men,Isa 54. 4. Iudgement failes and stands a
farre off, equity enters not. The co~|mon
trade of the times, being to
weaue hes in all cases, esepecially a|gainst
the true seruants of God. And
the common weaknesse of the times,
to receiue the sla~ders which are broa|hed
and bruited by tongues set on
fire from hell: so that he that refraines
from cunning, makes himselfe a prey,
the Latin whereof was all that Lewis
the eleuenth would haue his sonne to
learne:Qui nescit dis|simulare nescit iere. and is al the policy that most
udy and practise: Insomuch that the
common by words are, that when
men sweare by faith and truth, they
sweae by Idols that are not, names
they are and notions, things they are
not, nor substances: Iewels they are
but such as vse them 'die beggers: ho|nourable
Ladies and Mestresses they
are, but such as follow them close at
the heeles, may haue their teeth dash|ed
out of their heads.

Well, let deceiuers thus deceiue
 themselues, let cunning heads and
glozing to~gues make as much as they
wil of Tiberius his Art, or the Diuels
rather, the father of the Art, of dissi|mulation.
In the end they shall proue
it to bee most pernicious to the Stu|dents
and Masters of it. Let the chil|dren
of truth iustifie their mother,
which hath the reward of honour in
her right hand, and of wealth in the
left. And if it should be attended with
hatred and crosses for a time, yet hee
that is Amen, the true witnesse, yea
truth it selfe, will reward them in th
end: when he shall shut out with the
dogs, all such as loue and make lies;
with whose exhortation I close vp this
lincke, and knit with the following,
Buy the truth and sell it not, which hee
that meanes to doe must be


A true hater of couetousnesse,
The fourth Character. Prou. 17. 4
Else will Salomans seuerall prouerbs
 meet in him. The wicked giues heed
to the false lip,  the lier to a naughty

tongue. He taketh the gift out of the
bosome to wrest iudgement.Acceptatio u|neris est pra|ricatio veritatis. Accep|tation
of gifts proue commonly pre|uaricatio~
to the truth. It is impossible
to be a champion to Truth,  a slaue
to Mammon: but hee must loue the
one and hate the other. It is best ther|fore
to hate the worst, yea the worst
of al vices incident to magistracy: the
root of all euil, which if it be not roo|tod
out of the Magistrates heart, it a|lone
will poyson all the three former
qualities required in him. Neither
strength, nor religion, nor loue of the
truth, shall bee able to preserue him
from enchauntments of couetousnes.
Which being an inordinate loue of 
money,. an euill concupiscence of ha|uing
more then God hath alotted, or
a lawfull course affoordeth: is such a
kinde of Idolatry, as transformeth the
worshippers of this golden calfe into
Idolls themselues,Exd 27. making them to
haue eyes that see not, eares that heare
not: only leauing them hands to han|dle

that which peruerteth the eyes of
the wise.Deut. 6 19. It bores out their eyes, and
maketh them as blind as euer was
Sampson and Zedeiah.
Eyes you know are tender things,
 and small motes annoy them, euen
handfulls of barley and morsels of
bread make such men to transgresse:Ezek 3 8.
And a drams waight iniected, encline
the golden scales of Iustice to win
side they please.
There is such a strange bewitching
 power in Bulams deceiptfull wages,
that he that will admit them for Iu|stice,
shall soone take them for iniu|stice,
if the right hand be full of bribs
the left ha~d must be full of mischiefe.
The Diuell as well as the Briber laieth
his hookes in this sharp, whereof he
that is greedy,  will needs be rich,
falleth into his snare, and many other
oysome lusts,1 Tim. 6. which sinck men into
perdition, peirceth their soules with
sorrow, their names with reproach 
cause them to swerue from the truth

and make shipwracke of a good con|science:
Eue the most precious
things are vile and cheap in his eyes:
to whom money is deare, he will not
sticke with Ahab to sell euen himselfe
to worke wickednesse for the com|passing
of that his soule loueth and
longeth after.
But thou oh man of God flie these 
things, and hate couetousnes with a
perfect harred. Hate  as Ammon did
Thamar, first thrust it out of thy hart,
and shut  locke the doore after it.
Secondly,Heb. 13. 5. let thy behauiour and con|uersation
be auerse and strange from
the loue of money.. Let all sordid
and ffhyure he abhominable: all
ill gotten goods exeerable let them
stincke in thy nostrils, as ill as Vespati|ans
tribute of vrine.
Shake thy lap of bribes with Nehe|miah
Consider as Bernard 
Eugenius,Trees vt de sub  cres ai neq qum, sed vt ipsi de e. How the eople may grow
rich vnder thee,  not thou by them.
Reme~ber the end of Bbms wages,

and of Iudas his bag. And wish with
Damianus rather to haue Gehazies le|pry,
then his curse intailed to thee
and thy posterity,  inheritance after
thee: fretting thine estate as a canker
and moth, consuming your flesh as
fire, and crying in the eares of the
Lord of hosts for vengeance.
 But what doe I making my selfe
ridiculous to this olde doting coue|tous
age of the world: this thame on|ly
made the Pharisies laugh at Christ
his wes, because they were couetous:
And so doe they serue all our cauears
against couetousnesse, applauding
themselues and laughing in their
sleeues, when they behold their bag
in the chest, and their lands from of
their Turrets, saying to themselues,
What is a man but his wealth? What
is an office but the fees?
 There is a text in Esay,Esay. 33. 14. that if Paul
had the preaching of it, hee would
make euery groping and griping Fa|lix
to tremble, I meane such as the

Scripture termeth roring Lyons, ran|ging
Beares, Horse-leeches, Wolues,
deuouring all in the euening, and lea|uing
none till the morning: as well
Iudges that iudge for reward, and say
with shame, Bring you; such as the
Country calls Capon-Iustices: as al|so
such mercenary Lawyers, as sell
both their tongues and their silence,
their clients causes and their owne
consciences: who only keep life in the
law, so long as there is money in the
purse;  when this golden streame
ceaseth, the mill stands still, and the
case is altred: such extorting Officers
of Iustice, as inuent pullies and win|ches
for extraordinary fees, to the mi|serable
vndoing of poore suitors: such
false periurd Sheriffs, Stewards of li|berties
and their Deputies, as for mo|ney
falsifie their charges: such cor|rupted
Iurates and witnesses of the
post, which are as hammers and
swords, and sharpe arrowes in their
bretherens hearts: such cheese-bay|liffs

and lamb-bayliffs, as vex the
poore Countrey-men with vnist
summons to the Assises  Sessions,
with the rest of that Rabble.
These Muck-wormes of the world,
 which like the Gentles breede of p|trefaction,
 Beetles fed in the dung,
relishing nothing else but earthly
things: thinke there is no other god|linesse
but gaine, no happines but to
scrape and gather, to haue and to hold.
Let such consult shame to their hou|ses:
let such make their offices as ea|sting
nets for all fish that come: till
they get the Diuell and all: Let them
heape vp treasures of wickednesse 
treasures of wrath withall.
But where there is any feare of God
 and loue of the truth, let Iohns coun|sell
preuaile with them, to bee content
with their due wages: Let Paul per|swade
them, that godlinesse is gae
with contentation: Salomon, that
Gods blessing maketh rich, and adds
no sorrow therewith: So shall they

follow ethro's aduice the better, and
proue compleat Magistrates  Offi|cers:
Men of courage, men of religion,
men of truth, hating couetousnesse,
These are the foure Cardinall ver|tues 
of Magistrates, of which if all
were compounded; and were as omi|nent
for them as for their place: and
did (as the great Dictator of reason
speakes in his Politicks) as far exceede
the vulgar sort in those heroycall ver|tues,
as the statues of the gods, the sta|tues
of men: then would people be|come
voluntary subiects, put the scep|ters
into their hands, and the law of
commanding and obeying become
easie, things thought irreparable
would easily be reformed.



The third part.
But before I come to make vse of 
what hath beene sayd, let mee, as the
third part of my text, and the distri|bution
of Magistracy requires, tell
you to whom all this hath beene spo|ken:
not to Iudges and Iustices of

peace only, as I feare most haue ima|gined
in hearing it: but to al from the
highest and greatest, to the lowest 
least Instrument of Iustice, from the
Gouernour of the thousand, to the
Centurion, from him to the Tithing-man
or Decinour. To the which an|cient
diuision of the Iewish Co~mon-wealth,
our platforme agrees in sub|stance.
Their Sanedrim or Senate of
seuenty, to our Parliament, Counsell-Table,
Starr-chamber, Exchequer-chamber,
c. Our Iustices of Assises
in their Circuit, and Iustices of peace
in their general commission or domi|nion,
 High Sheriffs in their Shires,
answering to the Rulers of thousa~ds.
Our Iustices in their seuerall diui|sions,
Iudges of hundred Courts and
Turnes to their Rulers of hundreds,
to whom I may adde high Constables
in their places, our Court-leets, and
Court-barons, to the rulers of fifties;
to whom I add ordinary Constables
in their offices, our cheefe Pledges,

Tything-men or Deciners, to their
rulers of tens. Now all these Iethro
meanes, and speakes of euery one of
them in their station and degree, con|ceiuing
the Common-wealth, as an
instrument not well in tune, but the
lest of these strings be false or naught.
Contrary to the common and dan|gerous 
opinion of the vulgar, who to
their owne iniury thinke  say, that
it matters not for petty officers, Con|stables
and Bayliffs, c. though they
be of the lees and dregs of men; nay,
they hold that for some offices, It is
pitty any honest men should come
into them. Alas, alas, the more sub|iect
to tentation  vice it is, the more
needfull it is that none other should
haue them.
Oh but (say they) a good Iudge or 
Iustice may help all; they erre  are
deceiued; it is no one beame, though
neuer so bright, that enlightens all: It
is not the light and influence of the
fixed starres, though the greatest and

highest, but of the Sun and Moone,
and the lowest and neerest Orbs that
gouerne the world. It is the ground-wind,
not the rack-winde, that driues
mills and ships. It is the Ciuill, as
in the Ecclesiasticall body: if Bishops
be neuer so learned, and the parishi|nall
Minister negligent, worldly,
proud, or blind S^r. Iohns, the people
perish for want of vision.
What can the Superiour doe, if the
 Inferiour informe not: what can the
eye doe, if the hand and foot be croo|ked
and vnserviceable? yea, not onely
if such as be organs of Iustice, such as
haue places of Iudicature: but if the
media and spectacles of the sense will
yeeld a false report, how shall the
common sense make a right iudge|ment?
If Pladers and Attourneyes
will colour and gloze, if the Clarkes
and Pen-men make false records, may
not any of these disturb or peruor Iu|stice?
if the least finger or toe of this
body be distorted, I meane Iaylor or

Sergeant, or any other that should
execute Iustice, be remisse and slacke,
then must the Dutch-mans prouerb
be veryfied, Looke what the bell is
without the clapper, such are good
lawes and iudgements without de
execution.
Thus we see in this curious clock-work
of Iustice, the lest pin or wheee
amisse may distemper  disorder all:
but if care were had to frame all hese
parts of the building according to the
plat-forme of this skilfull Architect,
what an absolute armony of the
parts, what an exact perfection of the
whole; yea, what golden times should
we liue to see?
Hearken o yee mountaines and lit|tle 
hills, you Rulers of thousands, you
Rulers of tens, you reuere~d Sages of
the Lawes, you worshipfull Knights
and Gentlemen of the Countrey: yee
listen to this charg of Iethro: ye of the
meanest place of the common-welth,
weigh not things nor persons at the

common beame of custome  opi|nion,
but as the golden standart of
Gods Sanctuary, with these Gold|smiths
waights of my text: which if I
shall perswade you to doe, I feare that
wee must say with the Psalmist, that
sonnes of men Beni-Adam, yea the
cheefest men Beni-ish,Psal 6. 9. to be layed vpon
the ballance, will bee found lies and
lighter then vanity: heere money will
not make the man, nor craft carry it
away. Euery Nabal of mount Carmel,
nor euery Achitophel may not bee ad|mitted.
 This text saith to euery timorous,
prophane, falseharted, couetous per|son,
as Samuel to Saul, God hath rent
thine office from thee: and bestowed
it on thy better: or as the Scripture of
Iudas, let another more worthily take
his place: if this order  rule of triall
might take place, how many would
bee turned out of commission? how
many would bee effici perdae? how
would benches  Shire-houses bee
hinned?

As for this present, to the which 
God hath called me to speake (for if I
had called my selfe, I could not, nor
durst not speake) giue me leaue with|out
offence, to speake that plainly and
openly, which I conceiue inwardly:
when I haue come into the Shire-house,
sometimes to obserue the state
of it: it hath presented it selfe to my
view, not vnlike to that image of Da|nel,
or picture in Horace, or table of
the Popes of Rome, which for memo|ries
sake I reduce to these two Disticks
Ex auro caput est, argentea brachia, ve~ter
Aeneus, admisto ferrea cruraluto
Diuino capiti, ceruix humana, ferinus
Assuitur truncus Daemonijque pedes.
The head of gold. And with such 
honourable Iudges God hath vsually
 for a long time blessed this circuit.
If I had euer heard other of these pre|sent,
I durst not giue titles, lest my
maker should condemne me: yet be|ing
vnknowne to me but by fame,
which hath spoken all good: I desire

you to proue and weigh your selues
by Iethro's weights, and accordingly
to haue peace and approofe in your
owne consciences, before the Iudge
of all Iudges.
 The shoulders of siluer. A worthy
Bench, yet mingled with som drosse,
and not so refined as I haue knowne
and seene it, like the skie in a cleere
euening, bespangled with bright stars.
Many such there bee at this present,
God be praised, religious  able Iusti|ces
and so many, as I beleeue, few o|ther
Benches are furnished withall,
yet in this siluer I feare some drosse,
some whose skill  ability the Coun|trey
doubts of, being conceiued to be
either so simple or so timorous, that
they dare meddle with none that dare
meddle with them: or else so popular
they will displease none. The Diuell
himselfe they say may keepe an Ale-house
vnder their nose. Others whose
religion they call into question, at lest
for the truth, and for the power of it:

vnlesse religion may stand with com|mon
swearing, with drinking, with
familiarity with Papists  Recusants,
with vngouerned and vngodly fami|lies,
voyd of all exercises of religion,
fraught with spirits of the buttery,
Ruffians, Ale-house hunters, and such
as are the Sin-tutours and sin-leaders
to all the Countrey about them, I
hope there bee but few such, I could
wish there were none at all.
The brest and belly of brasse, the 
strength of the Countrey, in which
ranke I account the great Inquest,
Iury-men and Constables, of which
number how few make a conscience
to present disorders according to
oath, or that know and regard the
bond of an oath?
The legs and feet of iron and clay,
or mire. Indeed the very mire  dirt
of the Countrey, the Bayliffs, Stew|ards
of small liberties, Bum-Bayliffs,
laylours, c. if Beelzebub wanted of|ficers,
he needed no worse then some

of these: what misteries haue they to
vex the poore Countrey-men with
false arrests? and by vertue of that
Statute tying euery Free holder of
forty shillings per annum, to attend the
Assises, but I list not to stirr this sedi|ment
of the countrey too vnsauoury
to be taken vp in a sermon.
 Oh that some Iehosophet would 
 reforme, or that you Iudges in
thse your dayes of visitations, wold
redresse some part of these greeuan|ces,
and reduce all to this Ideae of le|thro's
which indeede would make an
Heauen vpon earth amongst vs. An
Vtopia I feare some will say, too good
to be true,Ob. obiecting to me as to Cat,
that he not discerning the times hee
liued in, looked for Plato's Common|wealth
in the dreggs of Romulus. And
so that these Magistrates thus limbed
ou, might be found in Moses golden
age of the world, but not in these lees
of time.
 To which I answere,Answ. that if Iethr

were now to giue aduice, hee would
double the force of it: If Dauids ra|son
bee true, it is now high time for
God to worke, for men haue destroy|ed
his Law. Was there euer more
 of courage then now, when sin
 audacious? of truth, when ?
of religion, when hypocrisie 
iiquity? of contentation, when the
 of the world so abounds? The
onely way to repayre these ruines of
the dying world is to renew gouern|me~t
to the primitiue beauty of it: the
fce whereof I haue now shewed in
this excellent Mirrour or Looking-glasse:
so you goe no away, and for|get
both the comlinesse and sports it
hath shewed you, but wash and bee
cleane, and such as it would haue you
to bee.
There being nothing else remai|ning 
o your perfection,  the peace
of the Common-wealth, but this one
Item following in my text, requiring
assiduity and diligence.

Let hem iudge the people at al times,The fourth part. c
 A most needefull  in times
that loue ease and priuate employ|ments,
with neglect of publique, Sit|ting
in the gate is perpetually neede|full.
Diligence in hearing and ending
cases would preuent that greeuance
of delayes, which occasioned Iethro
his discourse. How doe you thinke it
would haue affected him, to haue seen
six or seuen I haue heard sixteene
sums set vpon one suit. These our
English delayes being (as Marnixius
complayned) worse then the Spanish
strapadoes.
 And it is fit, though publique and
generall courts haue their termes, yet
 particular audience of petty gree|ances
should haue no vacation.
 Many are the suits and controuer|sies,
many are the criminall offences
that neede continuall inspection. Let
him therefore that hath an office, at|tend
to his office with cheerefulnesse;
hee that hath no leisure to heare his

neighbours causes: Let him (as the
woman said to Philip) haue no leisure
to beare office. Cursed is he that doth
the worke of the Lord negligently, 
withholdeth his hands there from.
You Gentle-men complaine often 
of Idoll shepheards, dumb dogs, c.
in the Ministery. But how many
such in he Magistracy? Som in com|mission,
that neuer sit on the Bench
but for fashion: Constables that are
but cyphers in their place. Forsooth
they will be no pragmatical fellowes,
no busiebodies to trouble the Coun|trey.
Is there no mean between busi|bodies
and tell-clockes, between fac|totum
and fay't neant.
From this neglect comes that 
wrong and iniury to the Assises, that
such petty causes, tribling actions and
complaints trouble these graue and
reuerend personages, which a meane
Yeo man were Iudge fit enough to
end in a chaire at home: when the
whole Shire must be troubled to heare

and iudge of a curtesie made out of
the path, or a blow giuen vpon the
shoulder vpon occasion of a wager or
such like bawble-trespasses which I
shame to mention. And to punish e|uery
petty larceny, euery small ryo
or disorder, which lighter controuer|sies
and faults, if perticular Offices
wold comprimize  redresse in their
Spheares, these greater Orbs should
not be troubled with them.
 Then indeed would that follow,
which Iethro assures Moses of in the
last part of my Text,The fift part. ver. 23 If thou
do this thing (God so commanding thee)
then shalt thou  thy people endure, 
al this people shal go quietly to their place.
An admirable emolument of Ma|gistracy
  sufficient reward of all the
paines of it: that they and the people
may goe home in peace, sit vnder their
vines and fig-trees, follow their cal|lings,
and that which is the cheefe
Iewell of all, may lead their liues in al
godlines and honesty. That the gold,

blew  purple silke might shine and
glister within the Tabernacle, the out
side was couered with red skins and
goats haire, such a shelter is Magistra|cy
to Gods Church and Religion.
Nebuchadnezzar was a great tree, 
euery particular Magistrate a little one
vnder whose boughs people build 
sing,  bring vp their young ones in
religious nurture, euen foster fathers
s Ioseph in Aegypt Such were the rich
 religious imes vnder Dauid Sa|lomon,
 vnder such as are described,
Esa. 32. which whole chapter is worth
the reading, as a iust Comme~tary vp|on
this poynt, setting foorth the feli|city,
quietnesse, plenty, vertue and
piety of iust gouernours, as are hiding
places from the winde, and refuges
from the tempest, riuers of waters to
dry places, and as raine to the new
mowen grasse, c.
Such also were the times enioyed 
by the Church vnder Constantine, de|ciphered
as I take it, Reula. 8. when

there was silence in the heauen about
halfe an houre, the golden vialls fil|led
with sweet odors, the prayers of
the Saints ascending as a pillar of
smoke vp to heauen.
 Of these times see Panegyricall
Sermo~s, and Encomiasticall discour|ses
storied of old, and one of them at
large recorded by Eusebius,Euseb. lib. 10 which
whole booke is nothing but an Elogi|um
of those peaceable dayes, wherin
the Church was edified  multiplied.
The Common-wealth being to the
Church, as the Elme to the Vine, or as
the garden to the Bees; the flourish|ing
of the one, the thriuing of the o|ther;
and the disturbance of the one;
the disquiet of the other.
 How can men either attend Gods
seruice or their owne worke, when
they are molested at home with drun|kards,
barretors, quarrelous persons,
when hurried vp to London with suits.
As I haue knowne a Constable mole|sted
with fiue or six actions, for an act

o stice, in punishing vice according
to his office. With what bitternesse
of spirit do men groa~e vnder delayed
and peruerted Iustice, when it is tur|ned
into Hemlocke, and turnes them
out of their wits, some of them swou|ning
at the sight of their orders, as I
haue heard from credible eye-witnes|ses,
others ready to destroy them|selues,
their aduersaries, yea  some|time
their Iudges.
Oh the benefit of good Magistrats,
It is an vnknowne good, as the Coun|try-man
in an ancient Poet, when he
had met withall, feelingly cries out,
that hee had found that summum bo|num,
which the Philosophers so much
sought after, he now enioying more
sweetnes of little, then of great reue|nues
in troublous times. Surely, we
Christians ought to prize it as the
meane of our greatest good, of our
peaceable frequenting of our Chur|ches,
and our seruing of God. Mar|chants
make a higher vse,  are more

glad of a calme then common passen|gers:
so should we Christians the
Heathens, by how much wee may
and ought to improoue it for richer
ends of Gods glory, and the saluation
of our soules.
 Lord what manner of persons
ought we to be in all godlinesse and
honesty, which enioy such length 
latitude of Halcion dayes, as we doe;
the tithe whereof, not onely former
dayes, but our neighbour Nations
would now be glad of.
 God giue vs the vse and fruite of
them, continue and encrease them,
which will then bee, when this Text
shall be more studied and practized.
Then (s Amos speakes) shall iudge|ment
flow as waters, and righteous|nesse
run downe as a mighty torrent;
or as Dauid, Then shall the earth en|crease,
al people shall praise God, and
God euen our God shal blesse vs, and
all the ends of the earth shall feare
him. And so I make Iethro's preface

my conclusion. I haue giuen you
counsell this day: Hearken to my
voyce, and the Lord God bee with
you all. Amen.
FINIS.





To my louing Brother Mr.
SAMVEL WARD.
BRother, if you meete with your Iethro's counsel
returned from beyond the seas, and as much
 your expectation preserued aliue, as his
 in law was against  Iniunction, mer|
as much as you will, but bee no more offended
 you haue cause. Ioab  wider on the 
hand in destroying Dauids Absolon, contrary
 be serious charge, yet Ioab was pardoned, and
 no brother. I haue noted you hitherto inexora|
for your owne publishing of any thing of your
 whether out of iudgement, modesty, curio|
or melancholy,  iudge not: but when others
 them with fruit and acceptance
 the light, I haue seene you rest content with
 publique good. The like leaue I haue taken,
 like successe, assuring you and my selfe
 the generall welcomnes and vsefullnes heereof

to all whom it concernes, which are the greatest
number of the land, euen so many as haue any refe|rence
to Sessions and Ailes, if not all sorts of
Christians. Onely I feare that the corruption of
our times is growne so grosse and Eglon-like, 
it doth not Eud-like enough shrpen the poy,
and send them home to the , that they 
to the quicke. I had my selfe added thereto
a proect and perwasion for the redresse of many
abuses crept into offices and officers hauing spent
so much time in the study of the law, and 
of some offices, s made me weary of the errours I
aw, and heartily wih the reformation of them:
but caring I haue learned too much bluntnesse and
plumpnese of speech among the Lutherans, which
is here as prme a quallitie, as smoothnes with you,
as also loath to meddle out of mine ob, in my se|cond
thoughts I suppressed it. And so wishing vnto
this, many diligent, conscionable and ingenuous
Readers and Appliers and to them Gods blessing
and the fruit intended, I take my leaue. From 
in Prusia.
Your Brother in the lesh, in th' Lord, and
in the vvorke of the ministry.
NATH. WARD.
