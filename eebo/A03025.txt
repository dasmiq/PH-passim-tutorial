TO
The Right Honoura|ble
LADIE, the
LADIE ANNE
COTTINGTON.
Right Honorable,
_I Have pro|vided
a
PRESENT
proporti|onable
to my skill
my time and your

Honors knowledge
of me, short: Your
desire many times to
heare others writing
out of my mouth,
made mee to put this
of my owne into
your hands; a rapso|die
of resolves and
observations, some
for contemplation, o|thers
for caution, the
first divine, the other
morall, when you
lose an houre from
better and graver

matters, throw it a|way
on these; wher|in
you have some|what
of God, of o|thers,
of our selves,
what God is to us,
what we should bee
to him, to others: there
cannot be much said
of it, because there is
but little said in it; in
all which little I in|tend
nothing to my
selfe, but to others.
The generall end of
reading is to know,

but the end of divine
reading is to good
our knowledge, and
if it doe good, I have
my end, and my re|ward,
whose office
is to live, not to my
selfe, but others, and
am a servant to all by
a common duety, but
your Honors by espe|ciall
relation
to be commanded,
I. H.





Horae Succisivae,
OR
SPARE-HOVRES
of
MEDITATIONS.

_MAke God the
first and last
of all thy
actions: so
beginne that
thou maist have him in
the end, otherwise I
doubt whether it had
beene better thou hadst
not begun.

That we brought no|thing
into this world, is
not more every where
knowne, than it is of e|very
one beleeved; but
that wee shall carry no|thing
out of this world,
is a sentence better
knowne than trusted, o|therwise
I thinke men
would take more care
to live well, than to dye
rich.
Wealth is not the
way to heaven, but the
contrary; all my care
shall bee how to live well,
and I am sure I shall ne|ver
dye poore.

Sleepe is but deaths el|der
brother, and death is
but a sleepe nicknam'd;
why should I more
feare to goe to my grave
than to my bed, since
both tend to my rest:
when I lye downe to
sleepe, I will thinke it
my last, and when I rise
againe, account my life
not continued but re|stor'd.
Too much labour
toyles the body, too
much looking the minde:
I will deale for my study
as for my stomacke, e|ver

rise with an appetite, lest
if I once surfet, I ever
loath it.
How hard it is for a
man to forget his sinne,
or remember his God,
not to doe that evill
which he should not, and
not to leave undone that
good which hee should
doe, every man can tell
by experience. I were
no man, if I had no sinne,
but if I am a Christian
I must not delight in sin;
if I cannot avoyd some
sinnes, yet I will stand
in none.

To doe any thing to
thinke to be talk'd of, is
the vainest thing in the
world; to give almes
and aske who sees, lo|seth
the prayse and the
reward: I may be seen to
give, I will not give to be
seene, that others are wit|nesse
to my piety is not
my fault, nor my praise;
I will never bee so ill a
friend to my selfe to sell
heaven for vaine-glorie.
The obedience of good
children proceeds not
from feare, but love; it is
a very bad nature will
doe nothing without

blowes; to turne to
our vomit as soone as
God is turn'd from his
rod, and aske who is the
Lord till a new plague,
is a state I know not
whether more to be fea|red
or pittied: if I can|not
avoyd correction, I
will mend with it; not
bee beaten twice for the
same fault.
I know not which is
worse; the bearer of tales
or the receiver, for the
one makes the other: I
will no lesse hate to tell
then to heare slaunders:
If I cannot stop others

mouthes, I will stop my
owne eares. The receiver
is as bad as the thiefe.
With God a Publi|can
goes beyond a Pha|risie,
a sigh or a groane,
that cannot bee uttered,
beyond a long prayer
with ostentation: Care
not how long, or how
lowd thy prayer be, but
how hearty.
Woman was first gi|ven
to man for a helpe,
since for a remedy, what
shall we thinke of those,
that turne the remedy in|to
a disease, and hold it
in all cases for some, and

in some cases for all, not
onely dangerous but
damnable to marry;
what is this but to teach
God what Hee hath to
doe? I have ever counted
it safe and wise to leave
that indifferent which
God hath left so.
GOD cannot endure
a Pharisee that saies and
doth not: with His disci|ples,
saying and doing
must not bee two mens
offices; if thou canst doe
but little, promise the
lesse; so though thou
maist bee thought nig|gardly,
because thou per|formest

so little, yet thou
shalt be knowne just be|cause
thou promised'st no
more.
A good man would
so be honourable, as hee
may still bee honest, not
broker for preferment;
if not worthy, let him
want it, but if deserving,
why should he buy his
due? I will neither grow
great by buying honour,
nor rich by selling it.
In injuries it is better
to take many, than give
one, in benefits the con|trary:
I will requite the

first with bearing them,
the second with requiting
them.
Evill communication
corrupts good manners.
Peter denied his master
among the Iewes, whom
he confessed among the
Apostles: I may have a
bad man of my familie,
I will never have a bad
familiar; or if at any
time of my court, never of
my counsell.
So live with men as
considering alwaies that
God sees thee, so pray
to God, as if every man

heard thee; doe nothing
which thou wouldest not
have God see done; de|sire
nothing which may
either wrong thy profes|sion
to aske, or Gods ho|nour
to graunt.
Every night is an Em|bleme
of death, in this,
that in both we rest from
our labours: I will la|bour
to long for my rest
in heaven, and I shall ne|ver
be loth to goe to bed
to the earth, who would
not desire to dye that he
might be with Christ?
It is good in prospe|rity,

to make roome for
adversity, that however
it come unsent for, it
may not come unlook'd
for; if it doe not come,
wee are never the worse,
if it doe come we are the
better provided; expe|ctation,
if it doe not hin|der
crosses, yet it lessens
them.
Earthly things are like
dreames, awake to no|thing;
like shadowes set
with the sun, wealth and
honour will either leave
us, or we them. I will
labour onely for those
pleasures which never

shall have an end, and be
more delighted that I
shall be happy, than that
I am so.
'Tis a good Signe,
when GOD chides us,
that He loves us, nothing
more proves us His than
blowes, nothing sooner
makes us His: God can
love His children well,
and not make wantons
of them; if I suffer, it is
that I may raigne. How
profitable is that afflicti|on,
that carries me to hea|ven?
Suffering is the way

to glory, sometime in
this World: Ioseph had
never beene a Courtier,
had hee not first beene a
prisoner.
Gods children are e|ver
the better for being
miserable, and end in
that; It is good for mee,
that I have been afflicted;
let God use me how Hee
will on earth, so I may
have what Hee hath pro|mised
to those that love
Him in heaven; Who
would not be a Lazarus
for a day, that hee might
sit in Abraham's bosome
for ever?

Gods Church must
be a lillie among thorns,
and while I am a member
of the Church, I must
not looke to fare better
than the whole Body, if
they have call'd the ma|ster
of the house Beelze|bub,
well may it be en|dur'd
to those of the
household; my comfort
is if I am reviled for His
sake, I shall be blessed.
Prosperity is like Vi|num
merum, all wine; it
makes drunke the soule,
and therefore God min|gles

it, that He may keep
us sober; feeds His chil|dren
with a bit and a
knocke, ever dishes His
sweete meate with sowre
sause: if wee did alwaies
abound wee would grow
proud, and forget our
selves; and if not some|times,
wee would despaire
and forget our God: I
will pray with Salomon,
give me neither wealth
nor poverty, but a meane;
or if wealth, grace to im|ploy
it, if poverty, pati|ence
to endure it.
Afflictions are the
medicines of the minde,

if they are not tooth|some,
let it suffice, they
are wholesome; 'tis not
required in Physicke
that it should please, but
heale, unlesse we esteeme
our pleasure above our
health: let me suffer, so I
may reigne, be beaten, so
I may be a son. Nothing
can be ever too much to
endure for those pleasures
which endure for ever.
There was never good
but was hard to get: the
prison and the hatchet,
sores and crums leade to
Abraham's bosome, and
the way thither is by

weeping-crosse: if many
tribulations will carry
me to heaven, on Gods
name let me have them;
welcome the poverty,
which makes me heire
to those riches that never
shall have an end.
I will deale for my
soule, as for my body,
never refuse health be|cause
the Phisicke that
should procure it, is bit|ter;
let it distast me, so it
heale me.
There are in the
world that thinke it too
great sawcinesse to be our
owne spokes-men to God

and therefore goe to S^t.
Some-body to preferre
their petitions for them:
I shall ever hold it good
manners to goe of my
owne errants to God, He
that bids me Come, will
bid me welcome; God
hath said, Come unto me
c. It is no unmanner|linesse
to come when I
am call'd.
All consciences like
all stomacks are not a|like
how many doe we
see digest those sinnes
with ease, which others
cannot get downe with
struggling, one straines

at a gnat, when another
swallowes a camell: hee
that will keepe cleere of
great sinnes, must make
conscience of all. I will
thinke no sinne little, be|cause
the least endangers
my soule, and it is all one
whether I sell my SA|VIOVR
for thirty pence,
with Iudas, or for halfe
I am worth, with Anani|as;
whether I goe to hell
for one sin, or for many.
This life is but a journey
unto death, and every day
we are some spannes nee|rer
the grave; how is it
that wee which are so

neere our death, are so
farre from thinking of it?
Security is a great enemy
to prevention, and a pre|sumption
that wee shall
not dye yet, makes men
that they doe not prepare
to dye at all: it is good
taking time while time
is; if it come suddenly
and find thee unprepared,
miserable man that thou
art, who shall deliver
thee from the body, c?
Therefore hath Nature
given us two eares and
but one mouth, that we
should heare twice as
much as wee should

speake: with all thy se|crets
trust neither thy
wife nor thy friend, hee
that is thriftie of his owne
tongue shall lesse feare a|nothers.
There are that affect
not so much to have true
friends as to have many,
and whisper to that
friend what they heare
from this, and againe,
to this, what from that:
and glory to have it
knowne, how much
they are trusted, where|as
they were therefore
trusted that it might not
be knowne: I have ever

thought it a maxime in
friendship, that he which
will bee intimate with
many, is entirely nones;
let me love and be lov'd
of all, I will bee inward
onely with a few: I had
rather have one meane
friend that I may call my
owne, than the most po|tent
where I must share
with others.
He that provides not
for his owne is worse
than an infidell; 'tis not
the blame of charity that
it begins at home, it is
that it ends not abroad:
I am not borne all to my

selfe, somewhat to my
friend, to my neighbour.
I will so care for my
owne, as I may relieve
others, and so doe for o|thers,
as I wrong not my
owne.
Much knowledge not
much speech, Emblem's
a wise man. I shall ever
hold it neither safe nor
wise, alwaies to speake
what I know of my
owne affaires, nor what
I thinke of others; a man
may speake too much
truth.

Pleasures like the Rose
are sweet but prickly,
the hony doth not coun|tervaile
the sting, all this
worlds delights are va|nity,
and end in vexation;
like Iudas while they
kisse, they betray. I
would neither be a Stoick
nor an Epicure, allow
of no pleasure, nor give
way to all: they are
good sause, but naught
to make a meale of, and
were given not to fill
the belly, but to relish
the meate: I may use
them sometimes for di|gestion,
never for food.

In crosses these two
things must be thought
on; first whence they
come, from God, Hee
strikes thee that made
thee, next wherefore they
come, for thy good
either to try thee or to
mend thee, if they bee
harsh, yet they be gain|full:
I shall ever count it a
good change, to have
the fire of persecution
for the fire of hell, who
would not rather smart
for a while then for ever:
let me rather have that
fire which is rewarded
with heaven, than these
pleasures which shall be

rewarded with fire.
Salomon's, Rejoyce oh
young man in the dayes
of thy youth, were the
finest thing in the world
if it were not for that
which follows, for all
this thou shall come to
judgement; to goe well,
lye soft, sleepe hard, if
there were noe after-reckoning;
who would
not say out of delight
what the Apostles did
out of amazement, It is
good for us to be here;
but when I have a
stewardship to account
for, and God knowes

how soone, my master
returning and my talent
to seek; the Bridegroome
entering and my oyle to
buy, I have more reason
to care how to redeeme
my time past, than to
spend the present.
To grow heavy or
lumpish with crosses, ar|gues
not so much want of
courage, as grace: no|thing
more soyles the re|putation
of a Christian,
than to have his minde
droope with his Mam|mon;
what if health,
friends, meanes, have all
forsooke thee, wilt thou

lose thy wittes together
with thy goods? all the
afflictions in this world,
cannot answer the joyes
of that other. I will ne|ver
care whose these plea|sures
I see be, while those
I doe not see are mine, and
the fountaine of plea|sures
whom I shall one
day see, as I am seene, shall
be mine.
Let another praise
thee and not thine owne
mouth; either we are far
from neighbours or ill
beloved among them,
when wee are faine to be
our owne trumpet, and

blaze our selves: the Iews,
not the Centurion, say, He
loved our Nation and
hath, c. It is both hono|rable
and humble to heare
of our praises, and tell of
our unworthinesse.
Many a little make a
mickle, every day a mite
will encrease our store; I
wil be ever adding to my
heape of knowledge, of
faith, c. That when the
Master returnes I may be
able to say, behold Lord,
thy two Talents have gai|ned
other two.
The building of the
soule, like that of the

world, is not done in a
day; grace like Ezekiel's
waters, is first to the
ancles, then to the knees,
c. In vaine doth any
thinke to bee perfect at
once, in an instant; well
is it for us, if after ma|ny
Lessons learn'd, and
heard in CHRIST'S
Schoole, wee get past
the spoone, and with
some yeares of teares and
prayers come to a sta|ture,
a growth; and with
clambering and paines,
like Zacheus, get to see
Christ time was when it
was said to the Apostles,
Oh yee of little faith; and

hee was once afraid to
confesse CHRIST, that
was not afterward afraid
to die for him: like Bees,
while we are here, we are
ever gathering, in His
good time wee shall bee
perfect, in the meane time
LORD suffer us not to
bee tempted above that
we are able.
God is that to the soule
which the Sunne is to the
world, light and heat, and
with them comforts and
stores it: he that hath God
hath every thing; God a|lone
is a world of friends
against millions of ene|mies:

then will I thinke
my selfe poore, misera|ble,
distressed, left, when
He leaves me.
Every thing almost we
see, borrowes its nature
from its soile; thus the
body and temper of men
differ with the aire; and
the soule like the body,
commonly savours some|thing
of the company it
keepes, and we grow fa|miliar
with their sinnes,
together with their per|sons;
at first winke at
them, then imitate them,
then defend them. I will
not bee more scrupulous

in the choyce of any
thing than of this: hee
can hardly have a good
soule, that hath a bad
companion.
Sinne at first is mo|dest,
and goes disguised
with Saul to Endor, that
after a while growes im|pudent,
and dares looke
bare-fac'd on the world;
first perswades to civill
recreations, thence bids
to unlawfull delights.
Hee that will prevent
the growth of sinne, must
resist the beginning; the
remedy is thought of too
late, where the disease is

past cure; 'tis easier pre|venting
a sicknesse, than
recovering it.
Custome as it lessens
favours, so it lessens sins;
else the same sinne would
still be monstrous, which
in time is not taken no|tice
of.
Goodnesse is not the
gift of all but some, but
perseverance onely of a
few; how many like Eze|kiahs
sun have gone back|ward,
and forsaken their
first love? How many
have we seene, that with

Caiaphas, would have rent
their cloaths at the name
of blasphemie, have after|ward
sworne by the life
of Pharaoh: what we are, is
no argument for what we
will be; every man knows
his beginning, not his end;
what hee is, not what he
shall be; let him that thin+keth
he stands, take heed
lest he fall.
When I take a serious
view of my selfe, and see
(besides inward discon|tents)
so many outward
enemies of quietnesse
every where, every mi|nute;
want, sicknesse, dan|gers,

losse of friends, of
health, of life, threatning
if not pursuing me: and
to these my spirituall ene|mies
so strong, my cor|ruptions
so many, my in|firmities
so continuall,
and my selfe so over|matched
with all these:
with Peter I beginne to
sinke, and I could wish I
had not beene, since I
must be miserable, but
when I looke up to hea|ven,
and those joyes I am
going to, I would not be
lesse miserable to be so
happie. GOD is my Fa|ther,
the Angels are my
fellowes Heaven is my

Inheritance; now if my
inheritance be in heaven,
why is not my desire
there? Where our trea|sure
is, there will our
heart be also, where our
treasure and our heart is,
there shall we be one day:
who would exchange his
future happinesse for a
present?
Contentation is a bles|sing,
not wealth; true ri|ches
consist not so in ha|ving
much, as in not de|siring
more: why then
doe wee so labour to a|bound,
and not rather to
be content? If I have but a

little, my account is the
lesse; if I have much, and
doe not more good, I
shall adde to my con|demnation,
together with
my store: I will ever
studie rather to use my
little well, than to en|crease
it.
I will not care to bee
rich, but to be good; this
onely is that treasure,
that never shall have an
end: let mee be rich in
goodnesse, and I cannot
complaine of povertie:
he onely is poore whom
GOD hates.

To speake little, is a
note of a wise man, to
speake well of a good
man: goodnesse is not
seene in the length or bre|vity
of our speech, but in
the matter, the streames
of the tongue runs from
the current of the heart,
and are like the fountaine;
it is a signe we have little
goodnesse in us, when there
comes little out of us: if
GOD were more in our
hearts, He would be of|ten
in our mouthes, and
with more reverence.
Though I will never af|fect
to speake of my good|nesse,

yet I will shew it in
my speech.
He that will be a Cri|ticke
of others actions,
had need look well to his
owne: 'tis a foule shame
to have that found in our
selves, which we would
take upon us to mend in
others: in this I will ever
follow my Saviours rule,
first get out mine owne
beame, and I shall see bet|ter
to helpe my brother
out with his more.
Injuries, if they dye
not, they kill: Here one|ly
a CHRISTIAN

must learne to forget: for
if wee forgive not men
their trespasses, neither
will our Father, c. In
this case my care shall be
onely how to put them
up, and leave vengeance
to whom it belongs, God
is ever his Iudge, that is
not his owne.
The malicious man is
so much no mans foe as
his owne; for while he is
out of charitie with o|thers,
GOD is so with
him; if he lov'd himselfe,
hee would not hate his
brother. I will love all
men for His sake that

made them: but the Chri|stian,
because he is GODS
sonne, I will love doubly,
for his owne sake, for his
Fathers sake.
GOD lookes not at
what we have beene, but
what we are: it is no com|mendation
to have beene
an Israelite. That we once
did well, addes to our
condemnation together
with our sinne; and if the
righteous man forsake
his righteousnesse, his re|ward
is lost: our former
goodnesse will not ex|cuse
our present evill,
the end crownes us:

what ever my beginning
hath beene, I shall ever
pray and endevour that I
may dye the death of the
righteous; and my latter
end may be like unto his,
for as the tree falls, so it
lyes.
Man till hee sinned
was naked and was not
ashamed, clothes are not
more our covering than
our shame, and wee may
justly blush every time
wee looke on them, not
bragge; the best orna|ment
of the body, is the
minde, and the best or|nament
of the minde, is

honesty: that best be|comes,
which best beseems,
not that which is most
us'd, But most decent.
I will neither looke
what others doe, nor
what I may doe, but
what I ought to doe,
many things are lawfull
which are not expedi|ent.
To doe well and say
nothing is Christianly,
to say well and doe no|thing
is Pharisaicall; if
the hands bee not Iacobs
as well as the voice, wee
are but impostors, cheats:
If we are good trees, by

our fruit they shall know
us. I will not lesse hate
not to doe good, than to
tell of it: my faith is dead
if it beare not.
Eating was the first
sinne in the world, and it
is now the sinne almost
of all the world; and as
before the building of
Babel so still in this, all
the Earth is of one lan|guage,
what shall we eat,
or what shall we drinke,
and wherewith, c. Ea|ting
and Drinking have
taken away our stomacks
to spirituall things: I will
never be so greedie as to

eat my selfe out of hea|ven:
He loves his belly
well, that with Esau will
sell his Birth-right for
pottage: of the two, I had
rather beg my bread with
Lazarus, than my water
with Dives.
Great mens Words
are like dead mens shoos,
hee may goe bare-foot
that waits for them: I
will ever bee a Didymus
in these, beleeve onely
what I see, so I shall nei|ther
be deceived with o|thers
promises my selfe,
nor deceive others with
them.

The good mans word
is his Oath, his actions
serve only to make good
his words: He that pro|mises
either what he can|not,
or what hee meanes
not: is for the first a Boa|ster,
and for the last an
Hypocrite; by such an one,
I will bee deceived but
once.
Dissimulation is state-policie,
and wise men set
out themselves as Ari|stotle
did his bookes, not
to bee understood at first
sight. He that alwayes
speakes what hee knowes,

is not wise, but hee that
doth not alwayes speake
what hee meanes, is not
honest. As I will not have
my heart at my tongues
end, yet I will have my
tongue speake from my
heart, it is not necessary
I must be dishonest, or a
foole.
Commonly your
open eares are open
mouth'd, and they that
are craving to heare, are
apt to tell: I will neither
desire to know much of
another mans estate, nor
impart much of my own;
never any man repented

him of saying nothing.
A Parasite of all Trades
is the basest, and in two
things like an Eccho; first,
that he speakes only what
he heares others; and that
he is nothing but voice,
words: next to an un|gratefull
man, I would
not be a flatterer.
Sinnes grow like
Grapes close, but in clu|sters:
Wee usually say,
He that will sweare, will
lye; and he that will lye,
will steale; and hee that
will doe all these, will
doe any thing. Satan

is a Serpent, if the head
bee once in, his whole
bodie will not bee long
behinde.
It is better to goe into
the House of mourning,
than into the House of
laughter, c. Hee is
worse than madde, that
with Herod will part with
a kingdome for a dance.
Hee takes little thought
for his sinnes, that thinkes
to put them out of his
head, as Cain and Saul
did with Musicke: Hee
that truly considers those
joyes which never shall
have an end, cannot

but desire to have an end
of these: Where the trea|sure
is, there will the
heart be also.
Gods promises doe
not binde Him to keep us
in our wickednesse, our
sinnes quit Him of His
promise, and us of His
protection, when wee
leave to be of His Fami|ly,
wee are none of His
Charge, His Friendship
keepes pace with ours.
If thou doest well, shalt
thou not bee accepted?
(sayes Hee to Cain) doe
well, and have well, such
as wee behave our selves

towards God, such shall
wee finde God towards
us; now if we doe smart,
thanke our selves.
Wee have too many
that have a double heart
in one body, but very
few that have but one
heart to two bodies, yet
so is it with friends, the
one ca~not laugh when the
other weepes; one friend
is the looking glasse of
the other, where face an|swers
face, when the one
smiles the other smiles,
when the one is sad the o|ther
is trobled, there is no
Amity where there is no

Sympathy; If I doe not
suffer in my SAVIOVR,
I doe not love Him. Can
the Head be ficke and the
Body not feele it.
There is a time to
laugh as well as a time to
mourne, we are not de|ny'd
the use of mirth, but
the excesse, it is not for|bidden
Fruit. Hee who
gave Oyle to cheere the
Countenance, gave Wine
also to glad the heart:
And I will not say, whe|ther
Salomons draught be
not sometimes in season;
Drinke, that thou maiest
forget thy poverty; yet

so as thou remember thy
God. God never inten|ded
religion should make
men Stoicks, as if to mew
up our selves from the
World, were to single
out our selves to God:
And because He hath for|bid
the abuse of things,
not to use them; thus
we should abstaine from
drink, because some men
have beene drunke: If
that which is one mans
meate proove another
mans poyson, the fault
is not in the meate, but in
the stomake. If they be
so easily abus'd, the more
our thankes, our praise,

if we doe not abuse them
wee shall be commended
for our temperance: we
cannot for our want of
them; GOD makes us
but to use them as wee
should, and wee cannot
have too much of them.
Where should Ioy be
but in the Fountaine of
Ioy, or how doe wee
partake of that Fountaine
and rejoice not; that Ioy
must beginne to fill here
that will be full here|after.
Hee shall never
sing Halelujah's, that
doth not first sing Hosan|na's:

Hee is no sound
Christian that is not ta|ken
with the glory hee
shall have, and rejoyce
in this, that his name is
written in the Booke of
Life.
God ever helpes at a
pinch, when all helpes
fail then is He seen, when
Iacob wants at home then
Ioseph is heard of abroad,
and when the prodigall
wants abroad then God
makes him thinke of
home. What if he will
not deliver Ionah from
the Tempest, yet Hee
will from the Whale:

If the danger bee great,
His Glory shall bee the
more; never despaire
then thou drooping soule,
why art thou cast down,
why art thou so disquie|ted,
c? The good|nesse
of thy God endu|reth
yet daily.
The Contention of
Christs time is the con|tention
of all the world,
who shall be the greatest,
and most men envy to be
out-gone in any thing,
even by those they love
best: If Ioseph be his Fa|thers
darling, hee is his
Brethrens eye-sore: and

I doubt me whether Da|vids
brothers were more
glad that Goliath was
slaine, or angry that by
their brother: bad na|tures
whom they cannot
reach by imitation, they
will by detraction: He
casteth out Devills
through Beelzebub, was
the Pharisees of Christ:
it argues very little
goodnesse in us when we
malice it in others, none
but a Cain (that ever I read
of) will envy, because
his workes are evill, and
his brothers good; they
are desperately wicked
that love not the lookes

of godlinesse.
It is an hard matter
for a man to know much
or have much and know
himselfe, and whence hee
hath it, if we would think
worse of our selves, we
should be better thought
of, but now our selfe-con|ceitednesse
breaks our
necke.
Most men are Pharisies
in this, that they love the
upermost seats, all would
be sonnes of Anak: if their
bodies did but swell with
their minds. The care of
the most is to live hono|rable

not well, their re|putation
is more car'd
for than their God: Occi|dat
mod regnet: With
that Mother of Nero, Let
them be damn'd so they
may be dub'd: what is
this but to exchange a
heavenly kingdome for
an earthly: Hee that will
be great upon any termes
shall one day repent that
He hath beene happie too
soone.
My Friends faults as
my owne, where I see
I will remedie: I may
(happily) hide or excuse
them to others, never to

himselfe, this were to
kill him with kindnesse,
and lest I should lose a
friend, lose a soule: I am
guilty of the losse of that
soule I might save and do
not.
Some Friends there
are, such as Ionadab to
Ammon, Pandors to their
wickednesse: Brethren
they are but in iniquitie;
He shall be no friend to
me that is a friend to my
faults: and I am no friend
to my selfe, if I think him
my enemy that tells me
of them, one day, if not
now, I shall heare of them

to my cost: Men may,
God will not winke at
small fults.
There is a friend to
himselfe, as Nabal, and
his charitie beginnes at
home, and there it ends;
neere is his coat, but nee|rer
is his skinne; againe,
there is a friend for gain,
by Diana wee live, hee
shall be their friend that
they can live by: So,
some love CHRIST,
because they feare Him,
He can destroy both soule
and body in, c. Others,
because they neede him,
but if we be true friends,

though there were none
of these wee would love
Him.
Friend of all compel|lations
is the dearest, the
sweetest; and as one of in|gratitude,
si ingratum dix|eris,
omnia dixeris: So
may I of friendship, call
him friend, and you have
said all, another selfe, or
rather the same selfe mul|tiplied;
skinne for skinne
and all that a man hath
will he give for his life,
and yet a man's life will
he give for his friend; if
our love will not follow
CHRIST through fire

and water wee are but
counterfeits.
Therfore did not God
at first make many women
and but one man, or many
men and but one woman,
that everie man should
not know there were
more than one woman in
the World; nor any wo|man
more than one man,
they that know more shall
not be knowne; CHRIST
shall say, Depart from me,
c. I know yee not.
I see many marriages
in the World and never a
good, one to his barnes

with the foole, another
to his board with the glut|ton,
one to his cups, ano|ther
to his coffers: onely
those marriages are bles|sed
from heaven, that are
made in heaven, they are
ill holpe up, that are mar|ried
to one another, and
not maried to CHRIST.
Beauty is as it hits, if
the heart do not answere
the face, it were better
missed, it will proove a
snare which was an orna|ment:
the more any have
of this, the more cause
they have to pray, Leade
us not into temptation.

Earth is a place of pe|nance;
and small drinke
and Camells haire doth
well; tis a place of toile
and labour, and men goe
not to worke in their best
cloathes: Men should do
well then to pranke up
their insides a little bet|ter,
and let the bodie
shift: I never heard any
man found fault with for
his ragges, I heare it up|braided
to one, that hee
went in purple.
It is not our meanes,
but our sinnes that shuts
us out from God; I will

be asham'd of nothing
but my sinnes, and proud
of nothing but that I am
a Christian.
I will never care what
I am in mens eyes, but in
Gods: Beautie, Wealth,
Honour, may make us
accepted of men, but 'tis
onely a broken heart can
doe the deed with God:
never any man came to
Heaven for his good
lookes.
Hee is not a Iew that
is so outwardly, then had
not Hlerusalem fallen:
nor he an Apostle, that

doth so professe it, then
had not Iudas been a cast|away:
The washing of
the out-side cleane will
not quitt us of being
Pharisees; The Kings
Daughter is all glorious
within, if wee bee good
Christians we are best at
core.
The good man ever sets
God betweene him and
harmes; and sayes, The
Lord is on my side, c.
He is no good Christian
that thinkes he can bee
safe without Him, or not
safe with Him.

Never any man was
a loser by his God, or
left in a danger, and stood
to Him: Lazarus may
stinke in his grave, but
he shall not be seene rot
there, neither the dungeon
nor the denne can shut us
from His providence, His
care: Elias Ravens shall
serve him in his meate:
and Daniels Lyons, since
they cannot feede him,
shall fast with him, and
rather starve than eate a
Saint: what cannot God
doe where He will? what
will He not do where He
loves? Oh God, they

doe not know thee that
distrust thee.
To give with hope to
receive, is to lend and not
to give: or rather to put
to use and not to lend: I
will give where I cannot
be requited, so shall my
reward be in Heaven.
Charitie is of that which
a man hath, and not of
that a man hath not: If
the purse will not reach
to a Sepulcher with that
Counseller of Arimathea,
yet a pound or two of
spice would bee seene: If
Silver and Gold that hast

none, yet such as thou
hast, a Mite would be
spared: Something, hath
some savour. Obedi|ence
is as well seene in
a little as in much; and if
he which gives a cup of
cold water shall not lose
his reward: I can never
be so poore to want this.
Where the cruse  meale
is low, 'tis not look'd that
the Cake should be bigge.
As wee must use this
World, so we must love
it, as if wee lov'd it not:
God would have earth|ly
things look'd at and
affected with all tempe|rance;

We may not be
peremptorie in our de|sire
of them. But as our
SAVIOVR of His cup,
Father if it be thy will, and
yet not my will but thy will.
Beggers must not be choo|sers:
Religion will teach us
in modestie to submit to
Him, and thinke that our
best, which God thinkes
so.
Seneca an heathen but a
Philosopher, could say,
hee was better borne,
than to be a slave to his
body, and they are no
better that are continuall
factors for it: Every man

layes up for a hard winter
and a Rainie-day: I will
lay up for that day which
I am sure will come, and
am not suer how soone
it will come.
The bare desiring of
earthly things, is not
unlawfull; Hee who
first taught us to pray,
allow'd us this in;
Give us this day our dai|ly
Bread; 'tis the ex|cesse,
either in using,
or in caring for them
makes them ill to us,
that are not so in them,
selves: I will so desire
these as I may bee the

better for enjoying them
and so imploy them, as I
may have little to account
for them; Why should
I abound to my cost?
Teares are a second
Bsme of the soule;
 it is rinced anew,
as the sinnes of the old
worlde, so of this little
world, neede a deluge.
There is but one sorrow
never to be repented of,
the sorrow of repentance:
only these teares goe into
Gods bottle, and thus bles|sed
are they that mourne.

Others eyes are Ser|mons
unto mine, when I
see a Peter weeping for
his denyall, it puts mee
in minde of mine: why
should I weepe for the
losse of my friends, 
my health, or of 
state, and not of my
soule.
There are two kindes
of teares, of joy and of
griefe: and two causes
of these kindes: Heaven
and our Sinnes; the one
of affection, the other of
remorse, the one for what
we have done, the other

for what we would have,
these two shall vie teares
in mine eyes, to be forgi|ven
and to be dissolved.
This World is a stage,
the play is a tragi-comedy
of the life and death of
man; every man playes
his part and exit: and it
may be he that hath liv'd
a begger, would not ex|change
with the KING
when he comes to dye;
for then he is rewarded,
not according to what he
hath beene, but what hee
hath done. I wil not great|ly
care, what part I play,
but to doe it well.

Home is home, be it
never so homely, sayes
the Proverbe: Men goe
forth to labour, and come
home to take their ease;
this world is our worke|house,
and Heaven is our
home, why am I loth to
goe to my rest?
This world is the val|ley
of teares, and we may
sooner want them, than
cause to shed them: I
will bee content to sow
in teares, that I may reape
in joy.

I reade of Augustus,
when ever hee heard of
any that dyed suddenly,
hee wish'd him and his
friends the like, si|milem. happi|nesse;
he shall not choose
for me: Let him and his
brother-heathens, pray
for their fooles paradise.
Our Church hath learn'd
us a better Language,
From sudden Death good
Lord deliver us. I ever
thought it not a little
blessing to dye by de|grees.
In this case the far|thest
way about is the nea|rest
way home.
Mee thinkes it is but

th' other day I came into
the world, and anon I am
leaving it: How time runs
away, and we meet with
Death alway, e're wee
have time to thinke our
selves alive: One doth
but breake-fast here, ano|ther
dine, hee that lives
longest doth but suppe:
We must all goe to bed in
another World. I will
so live every day, as if I
should live no more: 'tis
more than I know, if I
shall.
All goe to the same
home, but all goe not
the same way; one falls by

the hand of a brother, a|nother
by the fall of a
house, c. Againe all
goe to the same home,
but all goe not the same
pace, one dyes in his cra|dle
another on his crut|ches,
to some their life
is a prey, to others a
burthen: Iob and Ionah
are weary of living, and
Lot and Hezekiah would
live longer: as for the
way, I shall ever pray
God that I may take my
last sleepe in a whole
skinne; but for the pace,
Come LORD IESVS,
come quickly.

Death was given for
punishment of sinne, but
is the end of it; when we
lost Paradise, we met with
this, and againe when we
part with this wee meet
our Paradise: they that
know whither they are
going, cannot but wish
themselves gone, and say
with our Saviour, but in
another sense, Arise, let us
goe hence.
Through how many
dyings doe wee come to
our Death? And how
many deaths may wee
come to? Infinite are

our waies out of this life,
that have but one way in|to
it: Our life is compos'd
of nothing but deaths:
for that wee may live, o|ther
creatures die; again,
our child-hood dyes and
is forgotten when we are
growne up: Our youth
dyes when wee are men:
Our man-hood dies when
we are aged; at last Our
age dyes and all dyes, and
wee dye with it: every
day dyes at night; now
if my life consist of dayes,
what doe I else but dye
daily?

Favour is a thing to
esteeme, but not to build
on; hee that stands upon
others leggs knowes not
how soone they may
faile him: Greatnesse is
not eternall. I will never
leane so hard upon any
man, that if he breake he
shall give me a fall.
The things of this
world are in a manner
but apparitions, not so
indeed: all our Pompe
is but like the strowing
of Boughes before our
Saviour, taken up againe
straite, our provision here
is like that of the Gibeo|nites,

apt to moulder, o|pen
to the theefe, and the
moath, to be corrupted,
and stole, wee have wa|ters,
but like those of
Marah, bitter; we have
riches, but we have cros|ses;
sweete meate but
sowre sauce: they make a
fair shew but they last not;
I may say of them, what
my Saviour did of Israel,
their goodnesse is but as a
cloude, c. I will use
this world, but I will bee
in love with that better
onely; why should I de|light
to be miserable?

This world is a region
of Ghosts, or of dying
men, if not dead; our life
is but one continued sick|nesse,
and we are ever in a
comsumption, wasting:
wee now accompany
those to the grave, whom
shortly wee must keepe
company with in the
Grave: Every man must
have his turne, and GOD
knowes whose turne is
next; it may bee thine,
it may bee mine, and
mine before thine, GOD
knowes; thou hast more
yeares, (it may be) and
therefore as thou thin|kest,

some strides before;
I am no lesse subject to
diseases, and therefore no
whit behinde, these threa|ten
no lesse to mee, than
age doth to others: Eve|ry
ache, every stitch tolles
the bell in mine eares, for
some have dyed of these;
but every strong sicknesse
digs the grave, and sayes
service over mee, and
cries, Dust to dust, c.
Since there is a time to
dye, and I know not the
time, I will provide for
it at all times: Blessed is
that servant whom when
the Master comes he shall
finde watching.

No man thinkes hee
shall live ever, yet most
men thinke they shall not
dye yet; otherwise, they
would dye better, and
more care for the heaven
they shall have, than the
earth they must part with;
this world will not last
alwaies.
Our life is but a day, it
is now noone: who
knowes how soone it shal
be night? I have a great
way to goe, and but a lit|tle
to spend (a little time
I meane) my care shall
be to make it hold out.
As we doe not gather,

so wee doe not looke for
grapes on thornes, or
figgs on thistles: such as
the seed is, such will the
fruit bee, and such as the
fruite is, so will the Har|vest
be, and one day (if
not now) God will re|ward
every man accor|ding
to his workes, and
ill shall be ill requited.
Sinne and punish|ment
are like the shad|dow
and the body, never
apart, like Iacob and Esau,
they follow one at the
heeles of another. Ne|ver
sinne went unpuni|shed;
the end of all sinne

if it be not repentance, is
hell: if I cannot have the
first, to be innocent, I wil
labour for the second, to
repent; next to the not
committing of a fault, is
the being sorry for it.
That which we usually
say of men, is sometimes
true of Christians, foule in
the cradle, and faire in the
saddle; an unhappie boy
may make a good man;
he that should have seene
Saul killing, would little
have thought ever to
have heard him preach|ing;
we may not judge of
the future by the present.

He runs farre that never
turnes. 'Tis not with God,
as with men, to say I will
forgive it, but I will ne're
forget it; with Him sins
repented of are as not
done, as a broken bone
well set is the faster ever
after. God lookes not at
what we have beene, but
what we are. Repentance
makes us frends with God,
re-intailes us in the inhe|ritance,
and by I know
not what strange heaven|ly
slight of hand, doth what
you would have it. If we
would but downe on our
knees and aske forgive|nesse
all should be forgot|ten.

Our life is but a walke,
wee come hither but to
take a turne or two, and
away; and all our life we
are going to our home,
and we doe not live but
travaile. Some gallop it
over, others goe a foot
pace: The poore man
curseth the houre hee
was borne while he lives,
because he goes no faster;
the rich worldling cur|seth
the houre hee was
borne, when he comes to
dye, because he can live
no longer: it is a like un|godly
to bee loth to dye
because we are happy, 

to desire to dye, because
we are miserable; I have
ill learned Christ, if I have
not learn'd to be content.
Humility is good to
all, best to it selfe; I doe
not heare it said hee that
boasteth of his good
workes, but he that con|fesseth
his sinnes shall
finde mercy: the Publi|can
not the Pharisie goes
away justified. God ne|ver
thinkes well of him
that thinks so of himselfe
and what he doth: they
that scorne to bee hum|bled,
cannot complaine
to be scorned.

All men would come
to heaven, but they doe
not like the way; they like
well of Lazarus in Abra|ham's
bosome, but not at
Dives doore, they love
heaven well, but they
would not pinch for it:
silly wretch, al the wealth
in the world cannot buy
thee into heaven, or out of
thy punishment, and this
thy glory shall adde to
thy torment, that thou
are now so well, shall one
day be the worse for thee.
I had rather wait for my
happinesse, than smart
for it.

God preacheth to us no
lesse in His judgements
than His word; when He
strikes offenders, Hee
would warne the standers
by, and beats some upon
others backes; when I see
another shiprack'd before
mine eies, it bids me look
well to my tacklings. E|very
man sees himselfe
fall in his neighbour: O|thers
harmes threaten me
and say with the Apostle,
What makes thee to differ
from another? where the
sinnes are the same, Oh
God, it is thy mercy that
thy judgements are not.

'Tis not an easie mat|ter
for men to beleeve
that which they know;
what-ever they doe
whereever they are, they
are seene: but because
GOD is invisible, they
thinke they are so too,
and hee sees not because
hee is not seene: GOD
is inclusively in no place,
and yet hee is in every
place, and heares and sees
what is said and done; if
we did but consider this,
wee would neither doe
nor speake what wee
would not have seene
and heard: Considerati|on

would tye mens
hands, and if they did
but deliberat, they would
not sinne.
It is no lesse sinne to
bee over earnest in pur|veying
for the Body,
than over prodigall in
pampering it: as well
Saint Lukes foole as his
glutton; Nabal as well as
Balthazar is condemn'd
of folly: and I heare Is|rael
chid not for eating,
but for laying up their
Manna. Make not hast
to bee rich, and make not
waste of thy riches. I

will neither feare pover|tie,
nor seeke it.
Our Eye extends but
to the out-side, the skin,
the righteousnesse of the
Scribes and Pharisies will
quit any of the censure
of men. Hee that fasts,
prayes, gives, goes for
current among us, I may
not thinke him otherwise
in his heart, that is not so
in his behaviour, with us
every man goes for what
he seemes, wee dare not
pronounce any man a Le|per
till we see the scabbe.
It was the evidence our
SAVIOVR left us, by

their fruit you shall know
them. Hypocrites while
they keepe their owne
counsell, doe not onely
grow among the wheat,
but goe for wheat. None
but God, or a Prophet, God
in a Prophet, could give
Gehezi the lye, and see
his sinne through his de|murenesse;
only He who
knowes all things, knows
who are His, and shal one
day gather the wheat in|to
His barne, but shall
burne up the chaffe with
unquenchable fire.

To how many, under
God, doe wee owe our
selves for being: to the
sheepe, the silke-worme,
for food, rayment; when
wee are at our finest, wee
are but like Aesop's Crow
in stollen feathers, and
if every creature should
claime his owne, wee
must be glad of fig-leaves
againe, or ashamed of our
nakednesse: Why are
wee more proud of our
embroyderies, than our
Grandfires were of their
Aprons? Since both
are but borrowed; and
what hast thou that thou

hast not received? Now
if thou hadst received it,
Why dost thou glory as
if thou hast not received?
GOD made all the
World for man, man
for himselfe, other crea|tures
to serve themselves
and us; us to prayse and
give thankes to Him; and
He who prepar'd a dwel|ling
for us on earth, is
gone to prepare a place
for us in Heaven: let us
take heede lest by our
disobedience wee loose
our second PARADISE,
as our Fathers did their
first.

The Covetous man
hath his eyes in his feete,
ever poring on the earth,
all his care is, to lay up
for many yeares: like spi|ders,
men spend their
bowels to catch flyes,
trifles: toyle and sweate,
and all that they may
leave a little behind them
when they dye: if they
have but somewhat to
leave behinde them, 'tis
no matter whether they
have any thing to carrie
with them. All are for
the present, is it not good,
if there bee peace in my
dayes? Hee that truly re|members

what hee hath
lost, cannot be so deligh|ted
with what hee hath,
then onely mayest thou
say to thy Soule, Take
thy rest, when thou hast
wealth layd up, not for
many yeeres, but for e|ver.
I usually see Parents
most affect those Chil|dren,
that most resemble
them; I am sure it is so
with God, they are best
lik'd that are most like
him, nothing shall ever be
able to separate Christ
from him, that will not
be seprate from Christ.

It is with the soule as
with the graine: that
which wee sowe pure
wheate, comes up with
chaffe and straw: there
is no fruit but hath it's
core, its kernell, its stone:
in vaine doe wee thinke
while wee live heere to
be at our best. It is not
look'd wee should bee
Angells upon earth: the
best have their faults:
happie is hee that hath
least and fewest: our
prayer must bee, Lord
keepe us from presumptuous
sinnes: for sinnes of in|firmitie,
like ill weeds,

grow apace; Tares there
will be, well is it with us
if we be not overgrowne
with thornes and briars,
surfetting and drunkennesse
c. and the Day of the
Lord come upon us una|wares.
At usuall things wee
lesse admire; While Mo|ses
doth onely what the
Magicians can, hee is
slighted; men are taken
with something that is
not ordinary. All Sa|maria
will runne out to
see a man can tell them all
that ever they did; and I
doubt whether the A|postles

drew not more af|ter
their miracles than
their doctrine, when they
beginne to heale and cast
out Divels once, Simon
Magus will bee one too;
I will admire GOD for
His power: but I will
love Him onely for Him|selfe.
Two things our SAVIOVR
commends to
us from His other crea|tures,
Wisedome and In|nocencie,
from the Ser|pent
and the Dove: The
wisedome of the one may
stand with the innocency
of the other, nay it can|not

well stand without it:
Innocency without Dis|cretion
will make us too
forward with Peter, and
wrong our selves: A|gaine
Wisedome with|out
Innocency will make
us unjust stewards, and
wrong our Master: both
doe well, and onely both
doe well.
The poor man is Gods
lottery: cast in earth, and
yee shall draw heaven;
cast in a mite, and ye shall
draw without measure;
for God returnes not
tenne in the hundred, but
a hundred for tenne. I
will bee an Vsurer on|ly

to GOD.
Give and it shall be gi|ven
to you: He that com|mands
the one, promises
the other. Almes never
made their owner a
bankerupt; Charitie is
not so ill a servant, as
to leave the master a beg|ger.
That cruse and meale
shall never waste, that
the Prophet hath a Cake
of.
It is an easie matter
not to desire that which
we have not; to complain
when wee have no cause,
scarce speakes us men,

muchlesse Christians, but
when all failes to stand
our ground, and looke to
heaven for a handfull of
supply, speakes our faith:
At a Lions denne, or a
firy furnace, not to turne
tayle is a commendation
worthy a Prophet. It is no
honour to overcome,
when it is no danger to
fight. Adversity best
speakes a Christian in
prosperity, it is as easie
a matter to finde friends,
as not to neede them; but
when wee have nothing
left, not to leave GOD,
nor so much as whimper,
but chide downe our

distrust with a Deus pro|videbit:
My Sonne, God
will provide, tryes our
temper. Then is our va|lour
commendable, when
wee can endure to bee
Iobs.
When our Saviour
would put to silence the
distrusters of his time, He
points them to the Lilies
and the Crowes: the
Lilies of the field, not of
the garden, which are
digg'd and dung'd; but
of the field which have
no gardiner, but the Sun,
no watering pots but the
clouds, and your heavenly

Father (sayes He) clothes
these: Doth my Father
provide for others, and
will he see me goe naked?
What will He thinke too
much for His sonnes, that
is so bountifull to stran|gers?
How will Hee
cloath them, that so
cloathes the grasse? If
Salomon in all his royalty
was not arrayed like one
of these, the Sunne in all
his height, shall not shine
like one of us; when He
shall have chang'd our
vile bodies, that they may
be like unto His glorious
body.

Distrust is a sinne
which custome hath al|most
made commenda|ble.
Every man layes
up Manna for to mor|row,
forgetting that if
that be not wormes, they
themselves may be so. As
if there were no heaven,
but pleasure and abun|dance:
no other hell but
affliction and want; if
their purse grow light,
their heart grows heavy,
their mirth ends with
their store, and they think
no man can say to his
soule, take thy ease, that
hath not wealth layd up

for many yeares: but we
are not yet what wee
should bee, if wee cannot
be content to be what we
are, what ever it be. Beg|gers
must not be chusers;
'Tis not for us to teach
God which way He shall
bring us unto heaven, let
us thanke Him that we
come thither any way,
and if He will have us suf|fer
before we shall raigne,
downe on our knees, kisse
the rod, and not a word,
not a sob.

Whereever God is,
there are these two, in|crease
and multiply; Abra|ham
and Lot cannot
dwell together while
they dwell with him,
and I see Israel once to
bigge for Goshen, that is
now too little for Beth|lehem,
give a man God
and throw him into the
Sea, with Israel, Ionah,
and he sinkes not; needs
must he swim that is held
up by the chin.

In apparell we are not
to respect meerly neces|sity,
but decency. God
never meant religion
should make men slovens
or Stoicks, as if a man
could not weare good
cloathes and goe to hea|ven,
or a Christian were
ever bound in conscience
to be out of fashion: We
are not tyed to wander,
or to weare sheep-skins
and goat-skinns, because
the Apostle tels us some
did, some of whom the
world was not worthy, God
meant that those holy
men should bee patternes

of piety, not of fashions.
I will never be niggardly
of another mans purse,
deny my selfe that which
God hath not.
There may be pride
in the meanest things in
the world; no lesse the
Cynick of his tub, than
Alexander of all the world
besides: Sackcloth and
Ashes in the same bill
with purple and fine
linnen, both condemn'd
of pride; to fast and to
fare deliciously is strange
but true; and so much
worse is that pride than
this, by how much it

hath a better face; small
drinke and Camels haire
goes away Sainted,
though but counterfeited
when open pride is cryed
downe of all hands: and
of the two the least sus|pected
is the more into|lerable,
I am sure the
more incurable. A
knowne disease is every
mans cure, which when it
lyes hid is never medled
with: There is lesse hope
of an Hypocrite than an
Atheist.
Afflictions are Gods
mould in which He casts
His Children, spare the

rod, and spill the child is as
true in grace as nature.
God receiveth no sonne
whom He chastiseth not,
but tis with a gentle hand,
He leaves no markes be|hinde,
and He hath soone
throwne away His rod, if
with unfained resoluti|on
you will doe so no
more. God though He
beate many of His Chil|dren
till they cry, yet He
never beates any for cry|ing.
There is a double life
in man, and must bee a
double nourishment, men
live as if there were no

more to bee done, but
feede and be warme, food
and rayment are the
maine businesses of the
World: 'Tis true, wealth
and friends and health are
things to thanke God for,
but better desires better
becomes Christians; the
Christian man lives not by
bread onely, c. Meate
for the belly and the bel|ly
for meate, but God
shall destroy both it and
them, every good mans
meate and drinke is to do
the will of Him that sent
him.

God hath given us
this aire to breathe in,
it doth not give but con|tinue
life, 'tis the meanes
of living not the Author
of life: God gives it us
to use, not to serve. How
many make this world
their God, and serve it:
and God (as it were) but
their World to make use
of? I will never be a ser|vant
to my slave.
God though He be e|ver
the same in Himselfe,
He is not alwaies so in us,
though Hee love those
whom He doth love unto

the end, yet not without
Intermission. Men com|monly
never know the
benefit of a thing but by
the absence of it; wee
could not so well esteeme
of health, if it pleased not
God we were sometime
sicke: the long absence of
a desired friend makes
him more welcome at
his returne; thus Christ is
pleas'd sometime to with|draw
His presence, that
with more earnestnesse
we might be drawne to
seeke Him: Tell mee Oh
Thou whom my soule loveth
where thou feedest, c.

As when many eyes
are fixed upon one pi|ctture,
every one thinkes
the eyes of the picture to
be fixed on him; so with
our soules, all looke to|gether
at God, but every
one must appropriate
Him to himselfe. To
know that God is the
God of Abraham, the
God of Isaack, and the
God of Iacob, is but a
weake assurance that He
will provide for me, un|lesse
also He be my God;
our faith as our charity,
must begin at home, and
say, My Lord and my God.

Our Saviour doth not
say, doe unto others as
others doe unto you, but,
as you would have o|thers
doe unto you. If
thou wouldest have thy
neighbour do thee right,
doe so to him though he
have done thee wrong.
Lex talionis was never a
good Christian Law; If I
forgive not, I shall not be
forgiven.
As he cannot rise a|gaine
the resurrection of
the body that doth not
first dye the death of the
body: no more can he be

borne the birth of the
soule, that doth not first
dye the death of sinne.
It is necessary that hee
which will bee borne
twice, should dye once
while he lives, and hee
that will once rise the re|surrection
of life should
dye twice. That I may
live ever I will dye daily.
That two contraries
cannot consist in the same
subject, is as good Di|vinity,
as it is Philosophy;
Good and evill are like
Fire and Water, ever
contending till the one
be conquered; either

my sinns and I must part,
or God and I: I cannot be
at once Gods Church,
and the Divels chappell.
It is the fault of a great
many, if God beare with
them in their sinnes, they
thinke hee countenances
them: if they be not
presently striken dead
with Vzzah, they goe on;
when they smart not,
they beleeve not, and he
is not fear'd till felt. Sick|nesse
is not thought of till
death, nor that till hell:
forgetting that the long
sufferance of God should
lead them to repentance,

he forbeares us that hee
might forgive us; shall I
sinne because grace a|bounds?
God forbid.
God as He is infinite in
mercy, so is He in justice;
and as His mercy extends
to thousands in them that
love him, so do His judg|ments
to many generati|ons
of them that hate
Him. That He is long in
comming is no argument
that Hee will not come,
forbearance is no ac|quittance:
the longer
our time, the greater our
account, if we have liv'd
long and liv'd not well, of

young Saints prove old
Divells, wee had beene
better have gone to hea|ven
young, than to have
lived to these yeares to
goe to hell: miserable is
that mans case whose lat|ter
end is worse than his
beginning.
The relation betweene
sinning and falling is so
neere, that they are us'd
promiscuously the one
for the other. Now it is
a hard matter to fall
without hurt, and once
downe, it is not an easie
matter to rise without
helpe: Where it is so

dangerous to fall, and so
hard to rise; if we love
our selves we will looke
to our footing.
Most men feare to
heare ill, that feare not
to doe ill; the arrantest
hypocrite in the world
would not be thought so,
he would not be censur'd
for sinne, that feares not
to be damned for it, and
is afraid of holding up
his hand to the barre, that
is not afraid of standing
at the Tribunal seat of God
All the care is how to
sleepe in a whole skinne,
not so much to live well,

as to die safe, keepe with|out
the compasse of the
Law, though they come
within the teach of hell.
If this bee not to feare
men more than God, I
know not what is.
I should wonder many
times to see sin so smugge
to here a Iudas at his haile
Master and kisses; did I
not remember of what
Sire they come, the Di|vell:
and that he can stil
personate that goodnesse
he once had. He would
be more shunn'd, if he
could not bee mistaken,
that is not suspected in a disguise

where the adversary is
so subtile, they had need
bee wise as Serpents, that
would be innocent as
Doves.
Charity so forgives of|fences,
that it is ready not
only to pardon the offen|der,
but to doe for him,
and thinkes it selfe not
innocent that it starves
not it's enemy, while it
sees him starve. What
little difference is there in
Religion betweene not
saving and killing? we are
not commended that we
require not evill with the
like. We have not for|given

injuries if wee doe
onely not revenge them,
if wrongs tye our hands
from doing good where
we ought and may, they
prove sinnes to us, that
were but crosses; and we
wrong our selves more
by not doing than by
suffering: and God shall
so forgive us our trespasses:
For with what measure I
mete unto others, it shall be
measured unto me againe.
God deales by us as He
would have us deale by
others, and we must doe
by others, as we would
have them doe by us, and

all of us deale one with a|nother,
as we would have
God deale with all of us.
As I cannot love God and
hate my brother, so can
I not bee loved of God
How iustly is the fire of
Envy punished with the
fire of Hell?
It cost God more to
redeeme the world, than
to make it: He that made
mee with a word spea|king,
when he redeemed
me, spake, and wept, and
bled, and dyed to doe it:
what can I thinke too
much to endure for his
sake, that was made a

curse for mine.
It is with us heere as
with Gedeons fleece; one
while the ground is wet,
and the fleece is drye, a|nother
while the fleece is
wet, and the ground is
drye. Sometime wee
have Raine, and Faire
Weather would doe bet|ter;
anon it is Faire, and
Raine would be welcom|mer:
And it fares with
our bodies, as with our
estates, now happily we
have health, and want
meanes, then againe wee
have other things, and
want health; all our de|light

here is like our
selves fading: and many
times with Balthazar, we
are fetch'd off in the mids
of our jollitie: Nothing
here but ebbing and
flowing, tumult and al|teration;
in heaven onely
shall we rest from our la|bours:
now if wee love
our ease, why doe we so
love our lives?
The good man takes his
God as he doth his wife,
for richer, for poorer, in
sicknesse and in health:
we may not alwaies judge
of Gods favour by His
bounty. I am but a no|vice

in Religion, if I
thinke I cannot be Gods
sonne and miserable.
Commonly those men
are hottest in the pursuit
of honour that least de|serve
it; While deserved|nesse
sits still, and bides
his leasure that gives and
takes where he list, and
when, and how, and to
whom; and at last is im|portun'd
to the place, not
for the good he shall re|ceive,
but for that he may
doe: he will not be great
upon all termes, but will
rather endure poverty, tha~
part with his honesty, and

not sell his soule to buy a
purchase What will it pro|fit
a man to gaine the world
and lose his soule?
Christ is in us, as the
soule is in the body, hee
gives life; wee are in
Christ, as the branches in
the Vine, whence we re|ceive
life. Let our care
be to offer up our selves
living sacrifices to him,
of whom wee live and
moove: 'Tis all hee re|quires,
an egge of his
owne Bird, some minutes
of that time which hee
hath given us. What can
I doe lesse? one good

turne requires another,
if I love not those that
love mee, I come short
of Infidells.
Selfe-conceitednesse is
the sinne in fashion, 'Tis
a hard matter not to
thinke well of our selves;
I am not behinde the least
of the Apostles (yee know
the Voice) and if he had
not beene buffeted, hee
had beene exalted a|bove
measure, and car|ried
higher in conceite,
than he was before in his
extasie: he that well re|members
from what he
once fell, cannot but be

ashamed of what hee is
and fall yet lower: Oh
Lord, I am lesse than the
least of thy mercies.
Malice never wants a
marke. He who hath
nothing, hath something to
bee envied for, and if no|thing
else, he is envied
for this, that he is content
with his nothing. It is
hard to bee prosperous,
and bee loved at once:
Those that will be great,
shall be envied; it is hard
but safe, to be contented
with a little: but if I
cannot avoyd ill tongues,
my care shall be no to

deserve them; and then,
let Shimei curse.
I seldome see sinne but
in a religious tire: Nay
but I reserv'd them for sa|crifice,
was Sauls to Samu|el:
for sacrifice not for
prey. Goodnesse is the
best disguise of evill, ei|ther
seeme what thou art,
or be what thou seemest:
God is not mocked.
Their sinne is more
unpardonable that sinne
of purpose: malice leaves
the owner as without ex|cuse
so without hope:
Sinnes of ignorance ex|cuse

a tanto, save some
blowes. I may and doe
sinne dayly against my
will, I will not against my
knowledge.
What more glorious
Master than God? What
better Mother than the
Church? How glorious
is that calling that at once
serves such a Master, and
such a Mother? As it is
our glory to serve them,
so it must be our glory to
doe them good service.
God in us sets the world
copies of piety, and wee
must live to others no
lesse than preach: As we

are more eye, so we are
more look'd at, motes in
others eyes are beames in
ours: many things are
lawfull that are not expe|dient,
and some things are
expedient in respect of
the person, that are scan|dalous
meerely for the
chaire; that which is re|proveable
in another, is
in us a reproach: seeing
it is so, what manner of
men ought we to be.
Promotions are neither
from the East nor from
the West, but from God:
He that hath them and
not of His gift, hath them

with a vengeance who
would not rather wish to
want, than to be great so.
There was never any
that was not ambitious:
every man is borne a Co|rah,
onely some more su|perlative
than other. But
of all men I most won|der
at those that are am|bitious
onely to be talk'd
of, and since they cannot
bee notable they would
bee notorious, and with
Cain bee mark'd though
for murtherers. Whether
I know much, or am
knowne of many, it mat|ters
not, onely this I

will care for, that God
may not say to me in the
last day, I know thee not.
Pride is good to none,
worst to it selfe: when
Adam would better his
knowledge, hee lost his
dwelling in Paradise; and
when those builders of
Babel would mend their
dwelling, they lost their
knowledg. The itch of be|ing
great, potent, or poin|ted
at, how many hath
it undone? I will never
care to be or to know,
that which I know shall
repent me: what com|mendations
is it to have

beene some-body?
The tongue is the on|ly
betrayer of the minde:
The foole while he is si|lent
is not discovered. I
will not be more thriftie
of any thing, than of my
speech; I had rather be
thought to know a little,
than be knowne to know
nothing.
There is but one thing
a Christian need desire of
God, that's a cleane heart:
Create a new heart, c.
there is but this one thing
that God desires of a
Christian, his heart: My

sonne, give me thy heart;
and this I will onely de|sire
to have, that I may
give. A broken and a con|trite
heart, Oh God, thou
wilt not despise.
The Kings daughter is
all glorious within, but
yet her rayment too is of
wrought gold; our out|side,
our life must tell the
world what we are with|in.
If our lives doe not
answere our profession,
we are Pharisees, we say
and doe not.

It is a common fault
to forget what we have
beene, when wee are
changed for the better:
how many have beene re|solved
for heaven in their
sicknesse, that in their
whole skinne have dis|claim'd
it, and requited
the recovery of the body
with a relapse of the soule
To receive good at the
hands of the Lord, and not
evill, is unreasonable to
expect: but to receive
good at the hands of the
Lord, and returne evill, is
wicked and not to be en|dured.
I will never pray

more hartily to God for
a blessing than for grace
to manage it; Wherefore
should I be blessed to my
cost?
With God all things
are not onely alike possi|ble
but easie, and he can
as well of stones make A|braham
children as of Iews.
I will never despaire of
him that can do al things,
I cannot be so infinitely
sinful as God is merciful.
Oh God, if thou wilt, when
thou wilt thou canst make
me whole; why should I
give my selfe over, where
my Physician doth not?

Workes without faith
are like a suite of clothes
without a body, emptie:
Faith without workes is
like a body without
cloathes, no warmth,
want hear; Workes with|out
faith are not good
workes,  faith without
good workes is as good
as no faith, but a dead
Faith. Then onely are
they themselves, when
they are together, what
God hath joyned let no
man put asunder.

Our actions are never
pleasing to God, when
our light doth not shine
before men; let your
light so shine before men
that they may see your
good workes, and glori|fie
your Father which is
in heaven; that your Fa|ther
which is in heaven
may one day glorifie
you.
With men, confesse
and suffer is good justice,
but with God, the con|trarie
to confesse our sins
is the next way to be for|given
them; that soule is

past hope that lyes
speechlesse. I will ever
pray; Oh Lord, open thou
my lips, and my mouth shall
shew forth thy praise, and
my owne sinnes.
Pray for them that curse
you, doe good to them
that, c. Is durus sermo, a
hard saying, and against
the haire; 'tis not so easie
a matter to forget an ill
turne, as to doe one, yet
this must be if we will be
Christians: hee that will
not be in charity shall ne|ver
be in heaven. Why
should I doe my selfe a
shrewd turne because a|nother

would?
It was the divell that
first made us enemies to
God, and it is still he that
makes us enemies to one
another; it is not for no|thing
(I have thought) that
he is painted with a clove~
foote, hee loves divisions
so well, and there is no
greater argument of a di|vell
incarnate than a ma|licious
heart: say what
thou wilt, but I will ne|ver
beleeve thee against
scripture, that thou lovest
God whom thou hast
not seene, that lovest not
thy brother whom thou

hast seene; if wee love
Him we will love one a|nother.
If we will be Christs
Disciples we must leave
all, but its not all, wee
must take up our crosse
too; be readie to take it
up, not of our selves, but
if it be layd upon us, we
must suffer willingly for
Christs sake, we must not
suffer wilfully or throw
our selves into the fire.
He that bids us suffer, bids
us flye, If they persecute
you in one City, flye, c.
It is our commendation
to endure to stroke or

the Faggot, it is not to
seeke it when zeale
runnes without discreti|on,
warrant, it common|ly
makes more haste, than
good speed; CHRIST
would have us innocent,
but wise too, Serpents as
well as Doves, lay downe
our lives for His sake, but
not fling them downe;
we must neither goe like
beares to the stake, nor
like mad-men, neither
runne to our martyr|dome
or from it: Pray
with our SAVIOVR, if
it be possible to misse the
cup, or but to kisse it, but
still not my will but thy

Will, we must submit all
to God, and thinke that
fittest for us which Hee
thinkes so.
That which I heare
from David, I would
heare from every good
man, Thy word is a Lan|terne
to my feete, c. To
his feete, not to his eyes
alone; if we use the Word
of God onely to gaze on,
and see fine stories, to dis|course
by, not live by it;
wants his use, and wee
want our goodnesse, and
shall want our glory:
knowledge without pra|ctice
adds to our punish|ment

together with our
sinne. How many Pha|risees
have sate in Moses,
that shall never sit in A|brahams
bosome, onely
for this, because they
knew and did not.
Workes of piety must
never goe without humi|lity;
he that prayes and
is not humbled, like the
Pharisie in the parable,
goes away worse than
hee came. When thou
prayest, thou askest bles|sing,
and doe it on thy
knees, if to your earthly
father, how much more
to your heavenly: Men

have inverted the course
now, they drinke their
health upon their knees,
and pray for their health
upon their tailes, God
shall answere such men
according to their man|ners,
proudly. Why
should GOD stoope to
their wants, that stoope
not to their owne? we
cannot bee too humble
when we are to speake to
that Majestie, whom we
cannot see and live, and
whom wee shall one day
see and live to our cost,
if we be not humbled;
thanke God thou hast
knees to howe, how ma+ny

would that have not;
why shouldest thou bend
and cringe and bow, to
thy father or thy friend,
or thy betters, and not to
thy God.
Prayer is the Iacobs
ladder of the soule wher|on
it goes up and downe
to God, and conferres
with Him; in our praiers
wee blesse Him, and by
our prayers wee blesse
our selves: there is no
part of Gods worship
more acceptable or more
profitable than this of
prayer, and none more
slighted, men come to

prayer as to a thing indif|ferent;
wilfull negligence
in leaving it undone, and
coldnesse in doing of it,
are the sinne almost of
who not, only, Oh Lord,
doe thou be mercifull to the
neglect of thy people.
There are many ser|vices
and many Masters,
and yet no man can serve
two masters, that is, two
of a contrary disposition;
for there is the world,
the flesh, and the divell,
and ye may serve all these
at once, nay yee cannot
serve one and not all, the
glutton he serves his bel|ly

 with Esau sells his
birthright his blessing for
pottage: the drunkard
he serves I know not
well what, whether the
drinke, or the company,
or his appetite, or all, but
instead of quenching his
thirst, drownes his soule:
the envious man, and the
furious man are alike in
this, both serve the pas|sion,
onely here they dif|fer,
the envious man with
Sampson, will braine him|selfe
so hee may braine
others; the furious man
braines others so long till
at length he be brained
himselfe: the usurer he

serves his gold; the adul|terer
he serves his lust, but
all serve one chiefe Lord,
one Master, the Divell,
and shall all receive the
same Wages, which is the
wages of all sinne, death;
Why should God pay
them for their paines,
that goe not of His
errands.

SPARE
HOVRES
of Meditations.
The Second Part.
_BLessed are
the poore,
for theirs
is the king|dom
of hea|ven:
How are they poore
that have a Kingdome?
or what Kingdom is weal|thy,

if not that of heaven?
or why complain'st thou
of that povertie, that
saints thee? that is a hap|py
soule that makes even
with God every night;
and every morne begins
the World anew.
God is love, and hee
that loveth is borne of
God,  God loveth him;
so there is no love lost;
by this are we knowne to
be Gods sons and Christs
disciples, if we love one
another: I may love o|thers
for other respects,
my enemies that they may
bee good to mee, or my

friends because they are
so: but God I will love,
because I will love Him,
and because He is to be
beloved.
When I at first looke
out into the World, and
see many men (and those
none of the best) in better
case, I think my selfe for|gotten,
 wish for more:
but when I remember
my account, I feare I have
too much  forget those
wishes; It may bee if I
had more wealth, I should
be more riotous: outward
losses are somtimes gain|full,
and it is good for us

that wee are afflicted; it
would be worse with us, if
it were not sometimes
thus bad; many if they
were not kept short of
these would come short of
Heaven. He knowes us that
keeps us,  if He wil have
us Lazar's  not Dive's,
bring us to Heaven that
way rather than another,
His will be done; let Him
give my goods to the
poore, and my body to
be burn'd, and bring me
to Heaven, though in a
firy Chariot; I cannot
complaine of the foulenes
of that way that carries
me to God.

Things which wee
come easily by, we easily
part with; lightly come,
lightly goe; true friend|ship,
as it is hard to find,
so it is hardly lost, and
therefore hardly lost, be|cause
hard to find: I will
put up many injuries be|fore
I put off one friend;
small faults I will swallow:
others I will winke at;
and if he will not be my
other selfe, I will be his,
and change my nature
before my friend: friends
like stones, get nothing by
rolling.

We are content with
a little, when we are by
our selves; who puts on
scarlet, and resolves not
to be seene? or is serv'd
in plate, when there is
none to take witnesse of
it? Nature if it would
but be private, it would
not be so costly, most men
are therefore covetous, be|cause
they are ambitious,
and love the stage; and
desire to have much, that
they may have much to
shew, and set their land
upon their cupboards; I
thinke they would shew
more of their wit, if they

shewed lesse of their sub|stance,
they doe not so
much shew that to their
guests as themselves, and
are admir'd at, not for
the abundance of these,
but the want of the other.
Pride and Vncharita|blenesse
are sinnes in fashi|on,
and the one the cause
of the other, many thinke
they should vvant for
their pride, if they should
but be charitable; I have
often wondred and grie|ved
to see a rich porch,
and a poor Christians walls
cloath'd, and men goe na|ked.
Say what thou wilt,

but I am sure with the A|postle,
That hee cannot
love God whom he hath
not seene, that loves not
his brethren whom hee
hath seene, and can indure
to see miserable.
Many are therefore
friends to others, that
they may befriend them|selves:
and like leaves in
winter, fall from the trees
when they begin to wi|ther,
and with Saint Peter,
know not the man. How
many doe we nick-name
friends at large, that prove
but strangers at a pinch;
that will be your servants

in a complement, and not
know you in a businesse?
I will not desire of God
not to have friends, but
not such friends, or not to
need them.
We owe more to God
for redeeming us, than for
making us; His Word
made us, but when it
came to redeeme us, that
Word must be made flesh,
and that flesh must suffer
in our creation He gave us
our selves; but in our re|demption
He gave us Him|selfe;
and by giving Him|selfe
for us, gave us our
selves againe that were

lost; so that we owe our
selves, and all that wee
have twice told: and now
what shall wee give unto
thee,  Thou Preserver of
men, for our selves thus
given and restored? If we
could give our selves a
thousand times over, yet
what are we to God? and
yet if wee doe give our
selves to Him and His
service, such as we are,
and such as we can, Hee
accepts it, and will reward
it. I will never grudge
God His owne. I have no|thing
that is not His; and
if I give it to Him, He wil
restore it againe with in|terest,

never any man was
a loser by God.
The best ornament of
the body is the minde, and
the best ornament of the
minde is honestie; I will
care rather how to live
well, than how to go fine.
I may have an ill gar|ment,
and come to Hea|ven;
I cannot, and have
an ill soule. He who first
bid us cast our care upon
Him, did not so meane, as
if we should take no care
our selves; it will not
come to our share, to sit
still and cry, God helpe us:
Salomon hath read his

fortune, that will not
worke in summer; there|fore
shall hee starve in
winter: It was the desti|nie
sinne brought upon
the world, in the sweat of
thy browes thou shalt eate
thy meat, and thanke God
we can have it so: He that
made us without our selves,
will not keepe us without
our selves; it is mercie e|nough
for us, that we eat
with sweating. I will ne|ver
thinke much of my
paines, where it is rewar|ded
with a blessing.
If an Asse do but speake
once in a world, as Ba|laam's

did, a beast have
any part of a man in him,
we wonder, and justly;
but let a man have every
part of a beast, goe upon
all foure,  wallow with
the drunkard, or lose his
speech together with his
legges, tis ne're talk'd of.
It is the property of a
man to speake, as of a
beast not to speake: why
doe we wonder to heare
a beast speake, and not
wonder to heare a man
not able to speak? or how
justly doth he want the
blessing, that cannot aske
it?

It was our Saviours
to His disciples, Behold, I
send you as sheepe in the
middest of Wolves; blessed
Saviour, didst thou not
care for thy Disciples?
or if thou didst, why are
they not rather sent, as
Lions in the middest of
sheep; than as sheep in the
midst of wolves? Even
because He loved them,
therfore He so sent them,
that out of the Lions
mouth they might come
forth more glorious; as
there shall bee ever some
poore to exercise our cha|ritie;
so there shall bee

some wicked to exercise
our patience; some bulls
of Basan to compasse, c.
Where the enemies are
so strong and so many,
they had need be wise as
serpents, that will be in|nocent
as doves.
Desperately wicked is
that of some, if I shall be
sav'd, I shall be sav'd: as
if Heaven would come
unlook'd for, and they
should be sav'd, whether
they would or no God
never did, nor will save
any man in spight of his
teeth, or against his will;
as we cannot keepe body

and soule together, with|out
sweating; no more
can wee bring our soule
and God together with
sitting still; never any got
wealth, by barely wishing
for it: and as few come
to Heaven, by meerely
desiring it. There's a race
to be runne, and a battaile
to be fought and as well
in religion as in any thing,
we must worke for our li|ving.
It is appointed to all
men, once to dye: death is
a punishment of sinne, not
sinne itselfe; yet sure it is
the height of punishment

when it is suddaine; I doe
not desire not to dye at
all, but not all at once. I
know I must dye, and I
thinke of my death, yet
is it not alwayes in my
thoughts; the best of us
all may be taken napping.
I will ever pray God
when he doth fell me, not
to doe it at a blowe, that I
may see my selfe falling
and bethink me in the fall;
and thus it is a comforta|ble
thing to fall into the
hands of the living God.
He that knowes his ma|sters
will, and doth it not,
shall be beaten with ma|ny

stripes; and yet I can|not
say whether shall bee
worse beaten, hee that
may know it and will not,
or hee that doth know it,
and doth it not; the one
sinnes against his know|ledge,
the other sinnes be|cause
hee will not know,
and shall one day not be
knowne.
God made this world
not barely to looke on, but
to contemplate on, and of
Him in it: here the Chri|stian
 the Philosopher
part, they are led by rea|son,
we by faith: they ar|gue,
we beleeve: they en|quire

the manner, how all
were made, the Christian,
why: He is not curious
in the manner, but lookes
at the end, for the glorie
of God, and the way to
our glorie: and useth
them not for spectacles,
but motives, to the glo|rifying
of him of whom
he hath them; and if wee
enjoy these as we should,
we shall one day enjoy
him from whom we en|joy
them.
This World is oft
compar'd unto a sea, our
life is the Shippe, we are
the passengers, the grave

is the common haven,
Heaven is the shore; and
well is the grave com|par'd
unto a haven, for
there wee unload; the
things of this world are
neither borne with us, nor
doe dye with us; we goe
out of this world as we
came into it, naked: why
are wee so covetous of
those things, which are
so hard to get, and so cer|taine
to be lost? If I en|joy
them all, I shall not
enjoy them long: or if en|joy
but some, I shall short|ly
have use of none. I will
comfort my selfe against
the want of them, with

the assurance that I shall
one day not have need of
them.
Who can but once look
backe upon his creation,
and dares distrust God
for his preservation? whe|ther
is it easier to give, or
to continue life? to keepe
thee or to make thee? If
He have given thee the
greater, why dost thou
distrust Him for the less?
Or if thou distrust Him
for earth, how will you
take His word for Hea|ven?
Oh God, they have
forgot of who~ they live,
that distrust thee for their
life.

This life is a race, and
wee doe not live but tra|vell;
but we have another
race beside this, of our
soule as well as of our bo|die;
since both must bee
runne, and the one will
not tarrie for the other:
I will trie who can runne
fastest; if I have finished
my life  not my course,
I have made more haste
than good speede.
Every thing else hath
a beginning, it is onely
Gods title, Which was, and
is, and is to come: Eternity
is only there; our glory

must be, not that wee
have liv'd ever, but shall
doe so.
If wee looke but out
into the World, we shall
see almost as many mira|cles
as things, that trees
and plants should every
yeare dye, and recover;
that the Sunne should on|ly
lighten and warme the
earth, and not burne it;
that the heavens should
distill its raine in drops,
and not in rivers full, and
drowne us, where they do
but wet us; God is not lesse
miraculous in preserving
the World, than in ma|king

it; and as His mercie,
so His glorie is over all
His workes.
Religion with some
men is but a matter of fa|shion.
Many are of A|grippa's
Religion, almost
Christians; such men shall
be saved, as they doe be|leeve;
almost: God will
never owne: such halfe|fac'd
followers. The hy|pocrisie
of a Pharisee,
would have shamed thee
into an outside of Christi|anitie,
and unlesse your
righteousnesse exceede the
righteousnes of the Scribes
and Pharisees, you cannot

enter, c. It is not onely
want of grace, but wit, to
dissemble where we may
be discernd, if I will needs
bee a Christian, I will be
one to some purpose.
I heare men co~mended
now adaies as the Lord
did the unjust steward,
because they deale wise|ly,
not honestly; 'tis held
no crime to deceive, but
to be seene, to be discove|red,
that's a foule fault,
he is a novice that doth
that; the care of many is,
not to live innocent but
close,  they cast, how to
go (as Saul to Endor) to

the Divell in a disguise;
but they cosen onely
mens eyes, Gods they can|not;
and since they will
not be knowne for what
they are now, they shall
not be knowne for what
they would be one day.
God shall say unto them,
Depart from me yee wor|kers
of iniquitie, I know
you not.
To dissemble sinne was
never the way to be par|don'd
it, only he that con|fesseth
his sinne shall finde
mercie: never be asham'd
to say, what thou wer't
not asham'd to do: blush

to commit them, but not
to tell of them; it is better
that the world note thee
for a sinner, than God
for an hypocrite.
Some there are that
heare onely to tell, and
many times make diffe|rences,
where there were
none meant, it is not good
alwaies to tell all wee
heare; many a man speaks
that in his anger, which
in coole bloud, he would
not owne; and we doe a
double wrong by relating
that which the one is sor|rie
to heare, and the other
to have spoken, when he

is himselfe. I will heare
all, and report onely the
best, he that makes debate
betweene others layes a
baite for himselfe, it is safe
and honest to compose dis|cords,
but sowe none. I
will labour what I can, to
set others together, but
not by the eares.
When wee behold
(for who can choose?)
such a world of sinnes
in every corner of the
world; buyers and sellers
in the temple, and not
whipped out, selling our
soules for the provision
of their bodies: others

with Zimri Cosbi out|facing
judgement; how,
doe we not wonder and
blesse our selves that we
enjoy so good, so much,
some thing, any thing?
that Pharaohs leane kine
are not seene amongst us,
and the metamorphosis
of famine, of the heavens
to Brasse, and the earth
to Iron? that either the
clouds are not shut, to
with-hold their raine, or
that the windowes of
heaven are not opened, to
raine not water, but fire
and brimstone? It is ad|mirable
where the fact is
so foule, that the reprive

is so long? Oh Lord we
have nothing to say for
our selves, but acknow|ledge,
it is thy mercie
that wee are not consu|med.
Good natures are
wonne rather with in|treatie
than curstnesse, if
wee doe not more love
God, for His goodnesse
that He doth preserve us,
then feare Him for His
power that He can destroy
us, His mercies are ill be|stow'd
and worse im|ploy'd,
wee have not re|ceiv'd
the spirit of bon|dage
to feare. I will love

God, and honour Him, but
I will be affraid onely of
offending Him.
God loves timely
holinesse, remember thy
Creator in the daies of thy
youth. Nature ever begins
at the wrong end, layes
in, and layes up indeed,
but for the theefe and the
moth. With Absalom
the first care is taken to
leave a monument behind,
and when they are setled
upon earth, they will see
if God have any thing to
say to them for Heaven:
 the best part is the last
provided; such shall one

day have their heaven to
seeke, because they will
not have it to seeke now.
He that will not when he
may, c. You know the
Proverbe: He that doth
not seeke the Lord, while
He may be found, cannot
complaine, if he do after|ward
seek, and not finde.
All sinnes are forbid|den
trees to us; and wee
are so much ADAMS
sonnes in nothing as in
our disobedience, ever
reaching after that wee
should not; to do good,
there is a lion in the way,
like Salomons sluggard;

but to evil, how swift are
our feet? So then, it is
not going fast that car|ries
us to Heaven, but go|ing
right: I will care ra|ther
to set my foot down
sure, than to take it up
quicke; What am I the
neerer to goe a great pace
and the wrong way.
Every man is his own
worst foe, and his grea|test
enemies are those of
his owne house: we may
thanke our selves that we
live at no more ease than
we doe; In the sweat of
thy browes, thou shalt eate
thy meate was of our own

procuring. We had ne|ver
known so much evill,
if we had not desired to
know too much good, our
ambition hindered our
preferment; we were at
first made happie, and we
made our selves misera|ble,
 now we are misera|ble.
God hath chalked out
a way to our happinesse;
now if we love misery ra|ther
than blisse, it is fit we
should have enough on't.
A good man, still the
longer hee lives, the bet|ter
he dyes; men should
grow better, as they grow
older; not like a dead

hedge, the longer it
stands, the rottener. To
see a man white in his le|prosie
leaving the world,
and not his avarice; and
with S. Lukes foole; dye
thinking of his barnes, is
horrible. I had rather
have no portion on earth,
than buy it with that I
shall have in Heaven; I
will not (with the Curre
in the fable) part with my
flesh, for its shadow.
The way to sweeten
death is to thinke of it, e|very
day I live I will re|member
I might dye; and
I will not desire to live a

day longer, than I growe
some drammes better:
What will it benefit me
that I have liv'd some
houres which I cannot
answere for?
Worldly minds mind
nothing but Worldly
things. Laban and Nabal
think of nothing but their
sheep-shearing, and making
merry when they have
done; their businesse is
thought on, not their sal|vation;
for they make
that no part of the busi|nesse,
onely matter of
course; grudge God His

service, and in His service
the length of it; and pay
God His due, as Laban
did Iacob his wages, with
an ill wil; and would fetch
it back again if they could
tell how: and yet these
men that will steale time
from God for their pro|fit
and their businesse, will
steale time from their bu|sinesse
for their pleasure:
He that will breake the
Sabbath for an houres
work, will breake off his
work for an houres drink|ing.
Thus they prefer the
humoring of their soules,
to the saving of them.
I will never sell Heaven

for company, it is better
being a good Christian,
than a good fellow.
Every man would be
thought to bee in love
with heaven, and yet most
men are loth to shake
hands with earth; here is
the difference betweene
the heavenly Language
and ours; they cry, how
long Lord, how long? and
we crie, how soone? they
think He stayes too long,
and we thinke He comes
too fast. I will labour to
bee a follower of those,
with whom I would be
partner; he hath not yet

enough conn'd Heaven,
that is doth to goe to it;
that voice onely is wor|thy
an Apostle; I desire
to be dissolved, and to bee
with CHRIST.
The just man shall live
by his faith, and others
live by his charitie: true
faith is seene in its workes;
he that sayes he beleeves,
and doth not shew it, be|leeve
him not. To make
shew of beleeving, and
not in thy workes, is to
shew thy Hypocrisie, but
not thy saith.

Not every one that eats
his meat in the sweat of
his browes, shal eat bread
in the Kingdome of Hea|ven:
and yet it is not ea|ten
but with sweating nei|ther:
but 'tis such a sweat,
as will make thy heart
ake, and not thy lims: pri|zes
are not had but with
hazard, hee that will
drink of the water of the
Well of Bethel, with Da|vids
Worthies must tho|row
his enemies: the wa|ter
of life is not had, but
with hazard of our lives.
My comfort shall be, that
though I lose my life for

CHRISTS sake, I shall
not lose my labour. Or,
who would not lose this
life, which he is ever loo|king
to leave, for that
which he is sure ever to
enjoy? Oh Lord, wee
want lives to lose; I can|not
endure enough, to
come to Heaven.
This life, as if it would
never be done, is ever pro|viding
for; Eternall life,
as if it would never begin,
is never preparing for. I
will care for this life, but
not dote on it; I will re|member
I shall live ever,
but not here.

The love of the earth is
the disease of the world,
and that gulfe betweene
Abrahams bosome and
us, to forsake house and land
c that they do not like
of; if Christ would but
leave out, that same, leave
all, men would doe well
enough with Him: they
would enjoy this world,
but not with the losse of
a better. Againe, they
would enjoy that, but not
with the losse of this;
they would have their
Canaan, but they would
have their flesh-pots; they
love the blessing, but they

would not lose their pot|tage:
with Naaman, they
will worship no other
god, but yet, the Lord be
mercifull, c. when I enter
into the house of the god
Rimmon. They would so
please God, as they might
neither displease others,
nor themselves,  would
part stakes with God, let
such juglers in religion
look upon Saul in the Old
Testament, and Ananias
in the New, and read their
judgement: what society
hath light with darknesse?
The Arke Dagon were
never friendly househol|ders:
thou canst not at

once, have two such
guests, as GOD and the
divel; If one heaven could
not hold them both, how
shall one heart?
No man is so provi|dent
for his owne good,
as God is for every mans;
every sinner is an Absa|lom,
to Him, and He doth
not only wish, Would God
I had dyed for thee, c.
But dyed indeed: we doe
not so desire our owne
salvation, as He doth all
ours, promiseth, perswadeth
begges our obedience, He
leaves no way untried,
that He may leave us in|excusable,

wash His hands
of us, and say, perditio tua
ex te, c. Our destruction
if it do come, is from our
selves; if wee could but
wish well to our owne
soules, we could not but
do well: and yet it is not
wishing, but doing well
that doth the deed. I will
do what I can, and I will
desire to do what I should
and cannot. God accepts
a willing mind, and if I am
willing beyond my abili|ty,
He will either make
me able, or accept my wil.
O God, thou that workest
in me both to will and to
do, work my will to thine,

and my power to my will,
that I may not onely will
or desire, but do thy wil.
God doth not looke
for every thing from e|very
one: for ten talents
where He left but two:
onely Hee there exacts
much, where He hath gi|ven
much: if the seed of
thorny, or stony ground
bring forth no fruit, or
withered, it is no mar|vell;
but where He hath
dung'd and gooded, to ex|pect
a crop is but reasona|ble.
The more I have, the
more I have to answere
for; the greater my trust,

the greater my account:
Let others care how to
get more, my care shall be
how to pay for that I
have already.
All lands do not yeeld
the same things, and the
same land doth not yeeld
all things: thus God di|vides
His blessings to us,
as He doth to these, to
some strength of body, to
another strength of wit,
to one health, to another
knowledge, c. He hath
distributed to no man all
things: yet, to every man
some thing; he is strange|ly
miserable, that hath

nothing; but this doth
not please, if every one
have not all, they growe
surly. What wilt thou
give me, since I go child|lesse?
could the best of
the Patriarkes say: It is
hard and rare to see that
in others, which we want
our selves, and would
have, and be still. Whil'st
I am in this world, I shall
ever behold this inequali|tie,
and if I cannot make a
covenant with mine eyes,
I will with my heart:
Since I cannot but see it,
I will learn not to repine
at it: it is the Lord, let Him
do whatsoever He will.

God calls some men
to martyrdome, when o|thers
would startle at a
stake, and yet good Chri|stians
too: all men, as all
trees, are not fit for fewell,
that are fit for use; every
one cannot hold out a|gainst
the prison, and the
hatchet: It is an easie mat|ter
to dare affliction be|fore
it come, and when
it doth come, run away
from it. We know not
of what spirit wee are,
what metall we are made
of, our prayer must be,
first not to meet with
persecutions, and next to

endure them (but not meet
them.)
Earth is but our rode
to Heaven, and the things
of this world, like high|way
fruit, are common to
all: the sunne shines, and
raine falls alike upon the
just, and upon the un|just:
lest they should bee
thought evils, they are
given unto the good, and
least they should be too
well thought of, they are
afforded to the evill.
There is another good,
which is wholly the God|ly's,
and wholly to be
sought for the kingdome

of Heaven, and the righ|teousnesse
thereof: they,
whose kingdome is not
of this world, can see the
kingdomes of this world
(with their SAVIOVR
from the pinnacle) and
contemn them, or at least
not fall downe and wor|ship
them. It shall not
trouble me that I am out|bid
in these things by o|thers,
I will bee con|tented
to excell them in
better things, the comfort
I have, and the glory I
shall have.

The covetous man ne|ver
hath enough: like
Pharaohs leane kine, eates
but is never the fuller;
toiles and sweats wakes,
and wants for all this; it
is a greater miserie to de|sire
much, than to have
nothing; of no man can it
be better said, all is vani|tie
and vexation of spirit:
he is his owne tormen|tor,
and doth at once
make himselfe a hell here,
and provide himselfe one
hereafter; he is never at
rest till hee rest his last,
which yet is the begin|ning
of a worse torment;

so he robs himselfe, both
of the pleasure of this life,
and of a better. It is good
to bee covetous of good
things, and labour for
the food which perisheth
not: of this I will never
have enough, but pray:
Lord give me ever more of
this bread, ever and more.
All that God made at
first was good; He made
them so, He left them so:
if they be not still so, the
dishonour may be His, the
smart will be ours; their
goodnes consists in their
good usage, and our sinne
in the abuse of them. God

make us but to remem|ber
why they were made,
and we cannot be to seek
how they should be used.
Our Saviours com|mendation
of Iohn Baptist
was, that hee was a bur|ning
and shining lampe:
the hypocrit, like a glow|worme,
shines but burnes
not; others, like hell fire,
burne but shine not: and
must looke to have their
portion in the fire, they
resemble. We are not ex|cusable,
if we doe onely
shine and not burne, or
burne and not shine; the
one we see condemned in

the Laodiceans, because
they wanted heate; the
other in the foolish vir|gins,
because they wan|ted
light. Hee must first
shine one earth that will
after shine in heaven, and
burne on earth that will
burne in hell.
Rest is the whetstone of
labour. And that which
we usually say of hope, is
true of this, if it were not
for rest, the heart would
breake: wherefore God
hath given for every day
a night to rest in, and for
every seven, a day and a
night. We could not live

if wee had not this, yet
this must not be our life,
to live at ease, he shall ne|ver
enter into Gods rest,
that so loves his owne.
Every one almost, with
the Iewes, is weather wise,
and prognosticates with|out
booke, when you see a
cloud arise out of the west,
ye say there comes a showre,
c. hypocrites that can
discerne the face of the
weather, and not of the
times: how vainely are
men inquisitive for the
provision of their bodies,
and let their soules shift?
you will not plant or graft

without consulting with
your neighbours, and your
almanack; but in the point
of salvation huddle on,
and the Minister and Gods
Word is not intended?
How ill holp up art thou
to know the state of the
heavens, and not of thy
soule? If thou wilt needs
contemplate it, behold
it as thy home, not as thy
Calendar to better not thy
knowledge, but thy life, or
thy knowledge of a bet|ter
life, and thy desire of
that place where the Fa|ther
of life is, and where
thou desirest to live.

God made not death,
neither delights He in the
destruction of the living:
h God, suffer not that
which thou diddest not
make, to prevaile over
that which thou hast
made and redeemed. Man
is the glory of His maker,
and thy glorie thou wilt
not give to another; and
suffer not us to sell that
glorie thou hast allreadie
given, that we lose not
our share of that glorie
thou hast yet to give.
In some cases and
some things, a man may

know too much. It is not
good to be prying into
the privie Counsailes of
God: I doubt whether
some mens overbold|nesse
with the hidden
things of God, have not
made them an accursed
thing to them; and pres|sing
before their time or
leave into the Holy of
Holy's have barr'd them|selves
from ever com|ming
thither at all: why
should we call for light,
where God will have
none,  make windowes
into heaven? I will ad|mire
God in Himselfe,
and be content to know

Him no farther than in
His word where this light
leaves me, I will leave en|quiring,
and boast of my
ignorance.
What I have alreadie
done, was done long be|fore,
and what I am yet
to do, is alreadie done be|fore
God; this shall be my
comfort, that I can neither
doe nor suffer any thing,
without His knowledge
and leave.
God hath given man
charge of His other crea|tures,
and His Angells
charge over Him, and

they are now our keepers,
that shall be one day our
companions; great is His
love to us in their care,
and great should our care
be to continue this love;
and since we are alwaies
in His sight, and theirs,
why doe wee at all that
which we would not have
seene? My care shall be,
not to shunne His sight,
but not to provoke His an|ger:
what I doe, He sees:
and I will doe it as I
would answer it.
Those that honour
me, will I honour: is a
bargaine of Gods owne

making: Gods honour is
the way to ours, wee can|not
but be blest, if we will
but bee observant. I will
care onely to serve Him,
and I am sure I shall serve
my selfe. Never any man
lost in Gods service.
He who dwells not
in tabernacles made with
hands, will dwell in ta|bernacles
which His owne
hands have made, even
the hearts of men: and we
enjoy Him though wee
doe not see Him, for no
man hath seene God at
any time; He is invisible,
but not insensible. Our

blessednesse consists here
in feeling of Him, in hea|ven
in seeing of Him,
whom yet I doe not see,
and shall one day see as I
am seene: in the meane
time I will doe nothing
which I would not have
Him see, or may rob mee
of His sight.
I have read of the Hart
that hee weepes everie
yeere for the shedding of
his head, though to make
roome for a better: thus
I see the worldling goe a|way
sorrowfull at that
saying; Goe, sell all that
thou hast, though it be for

treasure in Heaven; men
do not look at what they
are to have, but what
they are to part with, and
are for one bird in the
hand, above five in the
bush; but he that consults
with his body for the sa|ving
of his soule, will ne|ver
bring it to heaven. Let
me sowe in teares, so I may
reape in joy, I will be con|tented
with the heaven I
shall have.
Many a man is there|fore
sinfull, because it is
gainfull. By Diana wee
live, that shall bee their
god, that they can live by;

but he trafficks ill for his
soule, that loseth it, to fill
his coffers. I had rather be
poore than wicked; it is not
thy poverty but thy sins
that shut thee out from
God; it is better going to
heaven in ragges, than to
hell in purple.
It is with the growth
of our soule, as with the
creation of our bodie,
we come up by degrees:
First, with Nicodemus,
we must be borne againe,
and then we must dwell
a while at the sucking-bottle,
from strength to
strength: which the Eu|nuch,
from reading the

Scriptures to understan|ding
them; from under|standing
to applying, from
applying to practising, of
hearers we become know|ers,
of knowers doers of
the Word, from perfe|ction
to perfection, or
rather from imperfecti|on
to perfection, from
persecuting the Church,
with Paul to preaching
to it: till we come from
Dives doore to Abra|ham's
bosome, from ea|ting
and drinking, from
marrying and giving in
marriage, to be as the An|gells
in heaven.
Many live as if they

came but into this world,
to make merry and away,
and after some yeares of
quaffing with Nabal, die
of a drunken fit: it were
well for such men, as they
have liv'd like beasts, if
they could die like them
too, never to live againe:
but alas they cannot, her's
their miserie; that they
only leave their pleasures
behinde them and not
their sinnes. I will labour
to leave my Sinnes be|hinde
mee, and have my
repentance goe before me,
and my good workes fol|low
after me, and I shall
meet with pleasures that

never shall have an end.
The eares are the
doores of the soule; with|out
these we were but ar|tificiall
creatures, men
onely in shew: hence we
know, we discourse, we be|leeve,
we learne to speake
to God, and heare God
speake to us; without these
we could not speake, not
know, not understand;
in a word, by these (un|der
God) we are what
we are; but some ther are
that cannot heare, others
that will not heare. It is a
lesse judgement to want
the power of hearing than

the will, to be borne deafe,
than to become so, they
that cannot heare are the
more excusable; but they
that will not heare, it were
farre better for such if
they had no eares.
Every envious man
is a mad-man, for he will
starve himselfe, to see a|nother
thrive, he needs
no other lent, than his
neighbours well-fare, o|ther
mens prosperitie is
his gallowes, where hee
will hang himselfe a hun|dred
times over, and at
last, with Achitophel, once
for all: I will not so de|desire

of God to have
much, as not to cover
much: hee that can but
thinke his owne enough,
will never think anothers
too much. I will never
grudge any mans going
before me, but to Hea|ven.
Most men look for the
theefs Paradise, to meet
with CHRIST upon His
crosse, Heaven upon his
death-bed, and reserves his
repentance, as the best bit,
for the last: and meane
to goe out of the world,
and out of their sinnes all
together. But how shall

God then heare them, that
before could not be heard
of them? In this case it is
good being formost, why
should'st thou put off re|pentance
till to morrow,
when for ought thou
know'st thy soule is go|ing
to hell this night with|out
it?
God give thee of the
dew of heaven, and of the
fatnesse of the earth, was
Isaaks blessing to mista|ken
Iacob. First of the
dew of heaven, and then
of the fatnesse of the
earth, (for alas what is
earth without a blessing

from heaven?) but of
Esau quite contrarie, first
of the fatnesse of the
earth, and then of the dew
of heaven; your Esau's pre|ferre
earth before heaven,
and therefore have their
heaven upon earth, God
gives them as much as
they care for: Ishmael
shall be made a great na|tion,
and that's enough;
but hee goes a wrong
course for his soule, that
thinkes preferrement is
the way to happinesse.
My indeavour shall bee
not to leave a name be|hinde
me upon earth, but
to finde it written in hea|ven.

The Sun is plac'd in
the heaven, as the heart in
this little world of ours,
keeping its seate in the
middle, lends life to eve|rie
part, whereas if it had
beene seated above, it
would have beene miss'd
below, and if below, it
could not so easily have
communicated above; so
that I knowe not whe|ther
wee owe more to
God, for creating the
Sunne, or for placing it;
not in the lowest sphere
then (like another Phae|ton)
instead of lighting
the world, it had burnt it;

or did it change place
with the higher planets,
wee should complaine of
cold, so wisely hath God
provided for our wel|fare,
with our being, and
hath set the Sunne not
too neare us, lest wee
should complaine of it,
nor too farre, lest wee
should want it, but in the
middle, where it is neither
an ill neighbour, nor too
great a stranger: when we
doe but looke upon what
we have, wee cannot di|strust
God for what wee
have not, and would
have. Oh God, they de|serve
to want, that can

distrust thee in sight of
these.
Whatsoever was ne|cessarie
for our preserva|tion
was created; and
whatsoever was necessa|ry
for our salvation was
written. I will neither de|sire
to know more than
God hath revealed, nor to
have more than Hee hath
provided.
Great mens actions are
authenticke: If Herod and
Caiaphas but begin, Christ
shall have fists enough a|bout
His eares; if Abi|melech
lead the way, e|very

man cuts his bough,
and askes no question:
with inferiours, Example
doth more than Precept,
and like men in a streame,
they do not swimme, but
are carried: Doe any of
the Rulers beleeve in him?
is thought argument e|nough
why others should
not; these see but by their
candle, and if the light be
darknesse, how great is
their darknesse? I will do
nothing which I would
not have God see, and o|thers
learne; else my light
were better under a bu|shell,
unseene, than follow'd
where it should not; thus

I shall helpe, not to
light others, but to burne
them.
Of idlenesse comes no
goodnesse, doing nothing
will in time come to do|ing
ill, and from beeing
idle to bee ill occupied;
the labour that is im|pos'd
upon the soule is
not to sit still, but to
runne. Good men must
not be like Davids ima|ges
that have feete, and
walke not; then only have
wee hope to come to our
journies end, when wee
keepe going.

Some mens devotion
is like hangings, which
they can take off, and tack
on as they please: out|sides
of Christians; their
hands and their eyes like
some tombe which they
have mark'd, are lifted
up; and they talke as the
divell to our Saviour, no|thing
but Scripture: and
with the Pharisee give
farthings in the market-place;
and yet all's but al|chymie,
but counterfeit:
these are ill men, but
well thought of. If I am
not what I should be, yet
I will not seeme what I

am not, or be an ill man
in good esteeme; what
am I the better, to bee a
Cast-away with credit?
What is GOD to me
without CHRIST? and
what is CHRIST to me
without faith? and what
is my faith to me without
charitie? but a dead faith?
and if my faith be dead,
what am I else but a dead
man? As it is vaine-glory
to boast of our workes,
so it is in vaine to boast of
our faith without works.
God as He loves young
holinesse, so He loves it

old; ye are those that have
continued with me, c. was
the praise of the Apostles;
Perseverance is the pillar
of our salvation: if that
fail al goes to the ground.
What commendation is
it to have done well? If
thou hast forsaken thy
first love, if thou hast lost
thy first hopes. Hee must
carrie his goodnes to his
grave, that will have it
carrie him to heaven.
If we looke but on our
bodies, we have matter e|nough
of wonder, to see
such a Common-wealth of
order; such a world of va|rieties

in this little world
of ours: But when wee
cast our eye aside, on that
part wherein wee resem|ble
God, the soule; how
doe we blush, and are a|sham'd
at our houses of
clay? that so glorious an
Image should dwell so
meanly, so pent up? that
the Bodie should bee a
companion for the Soule,
which shall one day be a
companion for Angels?
but thus was God pleas'd
to allay our pride. Wee
should have thought too
well of our selves, if we
had not had some peece of
us, like other creatures

of the earth, earthie. It
shal not trouble me what
metall my bodie be made
of; if my Soule be hea|venly,
my body shall one
day be so too.
When God sawe the
thoughts of mans heart
that they were evill, and
onely evill, and continu|ally:
It is said, it repented
Him that Hee had made
man; and that man whom
He shall see so still, will
have just cause to repent
him, that ever hee was
made, if he doth not re|pent
him of what he hath
done. God make me but

truly penitent for my sin,
and I shall never repent
me of my being.
It is a great way, and
requires a long time to
come to heaven; I admire
their strength, or rather
weaknesse, that talke of
getting it at the last gaspe,
as if it could be had with
a wet finger: I know
those that have liv'd some
yeares, and taken some
paines too, to set them|selves
forward, and if
they come thither at last,
wil think they have done
well too; for my owne
part, I neither desire, nor

hope to enjoy it without
a great deale of difficul|tie,
anguish and agonie:
and shall thinke it labour
well bestowed, that I
have it upon any termes.
Men usually measure
others by their owne bu|shels:
they that are ill
themselves, are com|monly
apt to thinke ill of
others; since no man is
free from slaunders, I
will not presently be|leeve
the worst of any
man, but I will speake
only the best.

Our greatest enemies
are within us: and there|fore
our greatest victorie
is to subdue our selves:
there is no such slavery as
to be a slave to ones selfe;
it is a strange weaknesse,
but ordinarie, to bee at
everie mans becke, but
our owne.
Olde men are twice
children; and some, as if
they were children for
yeares againe, as well as
for discretion, waxe most
worldly when they are
leaving the world; and as
their bodies draw nearer

the earth, so their minds
grow more earthie; as if
they were to live anew a|gaine,
or should set up a|gaine
under-ground: It is
good and commendable
to use these things while
wee have them, yet still
so, as remembring wee
must part with them. I
will never be loth to part
with that which I cannot
enjoy long; for to enjoy
that which I shall never
part with.
Every man for himselfe,
and God for us all, is a
common position, but an
ungodly one; that God is

all in us, and all in all, is
true: but that we should
bee all for our selves is
wicked; every man for
himselfe, and every man
for another. Thou it may
bee hast enough, and to
spare, another hath not
enough to live; why hath
God given thee so much a|bove
others, but that
thou should'st spare som|what
of thine to releeve
others? It may be thine
owne case; Every man
knowes his beginning, not
his ending; in the meane
time thank God, that thou
art not so, and help those
that are.

The barrennesse of the
bodie is sometime a curse,
but the barrennesse of the
soule is accursed; that is a
punishment, this a sin, and
punished with hell. We
came not into this world,
meerely to fill up roome,
but to bring forth fruit,
not for shew, but for use:
Our chiefe studie must be
not for ease, for riches, or
pleasure, but fruitfulnesse:
If we are all for pleasure,
our fruit is hell; and if we
are fruitfull, our pleasures
shall never end.

Blessed are they which
dye in the Lord, for they
rest from their labours: in
this world, there is no|thing
but dangers and dis|contents,
vanitie and vex|ation:
then only shall we
be at rest, when we cease
to bee: If wee thought
more of this, we would
not thinke much of our
affliction. If I am never
so beleaguer'd with sick|nesse,
or want, or famine,
or all at once, I will re|member
I came not into
this world to take my
rest, but to prepare for it.

That ground is verie
hard, where the travel+lers
foot leaves not im|pression:
and that heart's
very stonie, where Gods
blessing not only takes no
roote, but leaves no signe,
as soone forgotten as re|ceiv'd;
'tis all He askes
for all He doth, a thank|full
heart: With what
face can wee expect God
should give us our ask|ing,
that deny Him His?
God made other crea|tures
for mans service,
man for His owne: them
for our use, and us for His

glorie: How much, O
Lord, do we owe to thee
for our selves and them,
that hast so abounded to
us, above them, and hast
not made them but for
us? Teach us to give
our selves to thee, for
them, who hast given
them to us, for our selves.
God is glorified in all
His creatures, but not in
all alike; some glorifie
Him in their beauty, o|thers
in their deformity:
His glorie is not lesse
seene in our wants, than
in our abundance: in stri|king
with blindnesse, than

in our aboundance: in stri+king
with blindnesse, than
in healing the blinde; no
lesse in Ieroboams arme
dryed up, than restor'd:
therefore do we see some
want their sight, others
their feet; and yet it may
be neither for the childs
sinne, nor the Parents, as
our Saviour told the peo|ple,
but that the glorie of
God might be seene. A|gaine,
we see not only by
nature, but by accident,
one, with Mephibosheth,
by the negligence of a
nurse, another with A|bimelech
by the fall of a
stone lose a limme, or

their life: when wee see
this in others, and not
in our selves; how are
wee not thankfull to God
for our selves beyond o|thers?
Lepers in Soule
(God knowes) and it is
His mercy we are not so
in Bodie; whereby wee
should at once neede the
helpe and want the com|panie
of friends, and not
onely bee miserable, but
shunn'd. I will prayse
God not only for the good
which I have, but for the
evill which I might have,
and have not.

Our SAVIOVR knew
what He did, when Hee
taught us to pray: Our
FATHER which art in
Heaven, c. To give us,
and to forgive us, for He
onely can doe both; none
can forgive sinnes, or give
grace, but God alone. Yet
doth He not alwaies give
with His owne hand, but
reacheth grace and salva|tion
in His Word and Sa|craments,
by the hands of
His Ministers; and be|cause
no man can heare
His voice and live, Hee
speakes in them; it is the
wonder of His goodnes,

that He respects not only
our wants, but our infir|mities,
and would so ap|peare
to us, as Hee might
teach us, but not fright us:
Thus wee see Him speak|ing
to Moses himselfe, to
Israel by Moses: He pro|portions
the meanes an|swerable
to our strength;
wee are not like our
Maker, if we think scorne
to stoope to the weaknesse
of our brethren. I will
be all things to all, that
by any means I may win
some.
A good tree is knowne
by its fruit; yet all trees

doe not beare the same
fruit; our fruit may bee
all good, though it bee
not all the same: all are
not workers of miracles;
'tis not lookt wee should
remove Mountaines, or
walke upon the Sea, com|mand
the windes, or ap|pease
the waters: there
are other fruits of the
Spirit, that wee must
beare: Now the fruits
of the Spirit are these,
love, peace, joy, long-suffe|ring,
c. GOD make us
fruitfull in these, and we
shall have no neede of
those.

The end of all our SA|VIOVRS
miracles, for
the most part was, see you
tell no man: It is one les|son
in religion, not to be
seen: and yet not precisely
not to be seene, but not
therefore to doe well, to
be seene: our commenda|tions
must be to doe, and
not say; or if we say any
thing, say, we are unprofi|table
servants.
As the outward ser|vice
of the body, without
the inward sinceritie of
the heart is unprofitable:
so the contrary is unci|vil;

Gods service requires
reverence, as well as holi|nesse.
Many go to God as
they do to their compani|ons,
not kneeling, but sit|ting,
or lolling along; as if
they were the Iudge, not
the petitioner, or were to
grant suites, not to begge
some; and that unre|verentnesse
which they
would not, nay, which
they durst not use to this
or that Mr Gentleman,
they use to God: this is
neither becomming Chri|stians,
nor reasonable, or
at least civill men.
It is the fault of envie,

that it sees nothing but
injuries; but of charitie
that it sees none, or takes
no notice of them; but
when one cheek is struck,
it turnes the other: and
when it can turne no
way, lies downe under
the stroke: he that will be
righting himselfe of eve|ry
wrong, doth but pluck
more fistes about his
eares, and set God against
him too: who, if hee
would but be quiet, wold
revenge it to his hands;
unlesse we doubt of His
power, wee will trust God
with our wrongs; and
stay His leasure, that is

the fittest time for our
deliverance, which Hee
thinkes so; in this case we
are like men in a pit, the
more we stirre, the more
we are mired.
I see MOSES in the
Mount, and with the peo|ple
with a different face;
open to GOD, veil'd to
them; GOD would not
alwaies have us shew our
brightnesse to the world:
in some cases He loves
our talent in a napkin, lapt
up and hid. Let it suffice,
Hee knowes thee, that will
reward thee: others, if
they commend thee not,

it is because they know
thee not; or if they doe
commend thee, there's
all, and it may bee to
thy cost. Why shoul|dest
thou lose Heaven for
good words? or what
art thou the better, that
others commend thee, if
God do not? who there|fore
doth not, because
they do, I will never care
to have my praise ascend
up to Heaven, but to come
downe from Heaven.
Blessed are the mercifull
for they shall receive mer|cie:
GOD's promises,
though they be gracious,

yet they are confin'd: and
he only shall receive mer|cy
that shewes mercy; all
the wrongs thou receiv'st,
cannot equall one sinne
thou committest, and art
forgiven: now when God
hath forgiven thee thy
hundred Talents, which
thou owedst, and could'st
not pay: do not with the
evill servant take thy bro|ther
by the throat for
two; be not so cruell to
others, that hast God so
mercifull to thee: freely
thou art forgiven, freely
forgive; with what mea|sure
yee mete unto others,
with the same shall it bee

measured to you againe, and
if you give, you shall re|ceive
good measure; not
only shaken together and
pressed down, but running
over.
God as He doth not let
goodnesse go unrequited,
so doth He not requite it
with a little, or inch out
His blessings. He never
hath done enough for
those that love Him; one
good turne drawes on a|nother,
and Hee is ever
thinking, What could I
doe more for my Vine|yard
that I have not
done? There is no pains
of ours which falls to the

ground unaccepted, unre|warded,
who would not
serve that master, whose
service is perfect free|dome,
and the wages e|ternall
life? I cannot bee
more mine owne friend,
than by beeing GOD's
servant, and the Worlds
enemie.
Our bodies waxe wea|ker,
as they waxe older;
our sinnes as they waxe
older, they waxe stron|ger;
I will labour to bee
olde in goodnesse, and I
cannot complain of weak|nesse;
let mee but bee

too strong for my sinnes;
and I have strength e|nough.
Some men doe not re|venge
injuries, because
they cannot, they want
power; others because
they want opportunitie,
and doe but waite with
Esau: the dayes of the
mourning for my father are
at hand, and then I will slay
my brother. It is no god-a-mercie
to passe over
injuries when we can do
no other, he is not inno|cent
that is so perforce:
then is our goodnesse

commendable, when we
may hurt, and will not.
It is the fault of the
world, yet it is the fashion
of it, to put off God to the
last; the fall of the leafe,
will serve his turne: and
thinke one sigh at their
death, enough for all their
lives before; but true re|pentance
as it is not for a
spurt, so it is not done in
an instant. He that goes
about thorowly to make
riddance of his sinnes,
shall finde it a long busi|nesse;
sinnes are not like
servants, to be gone at a
quarters warning.

In many things we offend
all, is the voice of an A|postle;
the best have their
faults, he is happie that
hath least and fewest. I
can never be so holy as
to have no sinnes: my
care shall bee to repent
me of those I have; if
my repentance be daily,
my score shall never be
long.
Youth, and holinesse,
doe not meet often, to
see a young man dead to
sin and ready for death,
is admirable, but rare; it is
a good thing to be good

betimes, sinnes as they
growe old they growe
lusty, and if they once
get head, they know no
master, it is a harder mat|ter
to restore to godli|nesse,
than to make god|ly;
for there must be a
dedocebo te, c. an un|teaching
of that evill,
which they before lear|ned,
before there can be
an insertion of that good
which they must after
practise. Custome will
alter nature, and an use of
sinning make them in
love with sinne; it is
rarely seene that a young
divell proves an old Saint.

I will so begin, as I would
hold out, with GOD;
otherwise, it is ill that I
have begun, but worse
that I hold not out.
GOD desires not the
death of a sinner, but that
is not all, He doth not
onely not delight in our
ruine, but He desires our
recoverie. If we repent,
He spares us, if we returne
Hee receives us: for the
first, mercy to forgive;
for the second, an Abra|hams
bosome to receive;
if we wander, He recalls
us, if we be obstinate, he

intreats us: if we come
but slowly, He will stay
for us: in all His workes
He is wonderfull; but in
His workes of mercy, He
exceeds. I will never de|spaire
of that goodnesse
that hath no bounds; my
sinnes are infinite, but not
unpardonable. Hee was
once a persecutor, who
was after an Apostle: and
not behind the best of the
Apostles, that was once
before the worst of the
Iewes for cruelty: God is
able to make of a cast|away,
a convert; of a
theefe, a disciple: of stones,
children: of dead men,

living Saints, if the dis|ease
be desperate, the cure
is the glorie of the Phy|sician;
the recoverie is
more remarkeable of a
dead man to life, than of
a sicke man: if the dan|ger
were not great, there
were lesse praise of our
redemption: but when
our sinnes are gone o|ver
our heads; when the
beame of the timber, and
the stone in the wall crie
us guiltie; when thou art
possest, and not as Mary
Magdalen with a few di|vels,
but with Legions:
not one sinne, or small
sinnes, or a few sinnes,

seven divels, as it is said
of her, but past number;
like the starres or the
sands; and of the worst
sort of divells too, that
cannot easily be cast out,
but with fasting and prai|er,
and hast not onely
committed them, but li|ved
in them, and art now
dead in them: when we
have thus lost our selves,
and Him, to bee found
of Him and brought to
our selves, pusles us for
thankes: His armes are
ever open, onely our
hearts are shut: wee re|ceive
not, because wee
aske not, wee are not re|ceived,

because wee re|turne
not, or returne to
our vomit; It is but just,
when wee turne to our
sinnes, that GOD turne
to His judgements: ei|ther
wee must bee cut
off in our sinnes, or from
them.
Salvation is the gift
of God, it is given, and
yet it is got with a great
deale of struggling; thou
must fast, and watch,
and fight (as Saint Paul
saies) and as Saint Paul
did too, not onely with
beasts, after the man|ner

of men (though wic|ked
men are beasts in a
manner) but with princi|palities,
and powers, not
the Aegyptians, but the A|nakims,
Gyant sinnes,
growne temptations. My
glory shall be not to have
no sinnes, but to have the
mastery; not that I am not
set upon, but not beaten.
That we shall all dye,
we all know; when wee
shall dye, God knowes;
but how any man should
be dead while he is alive,
is strange wil some think,
and would bee glad to

know; yet so it is, sin is
a death, and every obsti|nate
sinner is dead for the
time. Some with Iairus
daughter are not dead
but sleepe; others with
Lazarus, are not onely
dead, but stinke; and it is
with sinne as with sick|nesse,
it weakens by de|grees;
first it distempers
the palate of the soule,
or spoiles the stomake,
so that either it refuseth
meat, or distastes it, or
puts it up againe; and
next it takes away the
sense that they feele not
their sinnes, and then are
remedilesse; and as our

Saviour told the Iewes,
they wil dye in their sins;
and this is a death men
care not to be acquainted
with til they be past cure:
and then onely thinke of
Heaven, when they are
going to hell, and after
forty or fifty yeares li|ving,
know not what be|longs
to dying, more
than, with Ezekiah, to
turne their face to the
wall, and weepe when it
comes: The way to dye
willingly is to conne death
before hand; he that hath
spent his life in providing
for his death, is not trou|bled
at his death how to

be provided of a better
life. My care shall be not
how I may not dye, but
how I may live ever.
Prosperitie is a great
enemy to goodnesse, how
hardly doe those which
have riches enter into the
Kingdome of Heaven?
I heare Israel praying in
Aegypt, quarreling in the
wildernesse? When they
were at their bricke-kills,
they would be at their de|votion,
and no sooner are
they at ease, but they are
wrangling for their flesh|pots;
I think many a man
had not been so bad, if he

had but been poore. It is
the saying of a wise Fa|ther,
that Salomons wealth
did him more hurt, than
his wisdom did him good.
Trouble, and want do that
many times, which faire
meanes cannot; wealth,
like knowledge puffes up,
when poverty (as their in|firmities
did many in the
Gospell) make men flock
to CHRIST. I will
never pray more heartily
to God for His blessings,
than for grace to use
them, nor to lessen my
miseries, but to add to my
strength. Though my af|flictions
be many or often,

so my strength be equall,
I shall get by them; the
stronger my tryall, the
greater will be both my
victorie and my reward.
The way to live ever,
is to live well, there is no
way to everlasting life,
but a good life; it is not
living at ease, or at ran|dome,
or at rack and man|ger,
in pompe and plentie,
mirth and jollity, and with
Saul think to drive away
the divell with musike.
God cares not how rich,
or how powerful thou art,
but how good. We should
so live as wee may have

joy of our life, and bee
made partaker of those
joyes, and that life which
are for ever.
There are many dead
men and manie deaths;
there is a death in sinne,
and a death for sinne, and
a death to sinne; the two
first we may thanke our
selves for, if wee had not
knowne sinne, we had not
known death, but the last
we must thanke God for,
it is from Him that wee
dye to sinne, that have de|serv'd
to dye for it, who
Himselfe dyed for us, and
hath taken our sins upon

Him, and at once delive|red
us from the sting of
death, and the strength of
sinne. And thankes be to
God who hath given us this
victorie, through our Lord
IESVS CHRIST.
We are in this world,
as Israel in the wildernes:
and Christ is to us as Mo|ses
was to them; if He
leave us, wee know not
which way to turne us;
nature cannot carrie us to
God. Here all our suffi|ciencie
is from Him, and
we say well in our praier,
for thine is the power and
the glorie; and it is by that

power, that wee come to
that glorie, our strength
is but borrowed; our stan|ding
but leaning upon His
arme; our going, but lea|ding
in His hand. It is
with us as it was with S.
Paul upon the way, wee
must be led, we must be
carried to God; we must
pray, turne us, O Lord, un|to
thee and wee shall be tur|ned.
Of our selves wee
are unable to goe, yet
drawe us, and wee shall
runne after thee; so shall
wee come to thee, with
thee, that are rather ima|ges,
that have feete, and
walke not, without thee.

It is betweene some
sinners and God, as be|tweene
some men  their
creditors; all their care is
how to be trusted, not
how to pay. My first
care shall be as little as I
can to come in Gods debt,
and my next care how to
come out of it.
Our goodnesse must be
that part of the wallet that
hangs behinde us, seene of
others, not of our selves:
our sinnes must bee that
part that hangs before us,
seene both of others, and
our selves. To conceale

sinne, was never the way
to be forgiven it; or what
art thou the safer, that
thou canst conceale it from
men, and not from God?
I had rather be censur'd
for my sin, than be dam|ned
for it.
As in Moralitie so in
Divinitie, not to goe for|ward
is to goe backwards;
and not to thrive in good|nesse,
is not to be good.
When I compare what I
am, with what I have
beene, I am not a little
proud; but when I com|pare
what I should bee,
with what I am, with Pe|ter

I begin to sinke; only
here's my comfort, I
shall be receiv'd, not ac|cording
to what I am;
but what I am in Christ.
Every good heart is
accuser, judge, and exe|cutioner
of its ownfaults:
Why should I be afraid
of standing at the tribu|nall
of my owne consci|ence,
and not of God? at
one I must; and if I judge
my selfe, I shall not bee
judged: I will prevent
Gods judgements with my
owne, and the feare of
what I should suffer, with
the sorrow for what I have

done; to him only is the
last judgement terrible,
that shunnes the first.
Wicked men as they
make most shew of mirth,
so they have least; their
heart and their face do not
agree; they carrie that in
their owne bosome, that
spoiles their laughing:
they are alwaies pursued
by themselves, and en|countred
with their own
thoughts. Their sleepe
is dreaming, and they
dreame of those judge|ments
in their sleepe,
which they have deserv'd
waking: every noyse is

of thunder, and everie
thunder of the last day;
every shadow is a spirit,
and their sinnes are so
many divels about them;
they have a double hell,
they dy a thousand deaths
here, and hereafter dye e|ternally.
There is no joy
like the joy in the Holy
Ghost: Nay, there is no
joy but that, and that is
as farre above all earthly
joy, as our heavenly joy
shall be above this. Hal|lelujah
above Hosanna.
Let mee but have this
within, and I care not how
the square goe without?

Death to the wicked e|ver
comes unwelcome, be|cause
they see it in its
worst shape, ghastly. Faine
they would not goe, and
goe they must, it is im|possible
they should live
still, but it is intolerable
to be still dying, which
is the life they are to live,
a living death. I will pray
God to season this life to
me, as I may not bee in
love with it, and so to re|member
me of my death,
as I may not be afraid of
it; and in my life so to
prepare me for my death,
that at my death I may

not onely bee prepared,
but assured of a better
life.
When I remember the
sinnes I have already com|mitted,
and some it may
be not throughly repen|ted
of; and those which
I do hourely commit, and
some it may be not taken
notice of: so many of in|firmitie
stealing upon me,
and other stronger sinnes
breaking in upon me: I
doe not will that good
which I should, or want
power to that will, or per|severance
to that power:
I am at a stand with the

Apostle, and thinke, mise|rable
man that I am, who
shall deliver me from this
body of death? Even He
that delivered His body to
death for me: Oh God,
thou that workest in me,
both to will and to doe,
worke my will to thine;
da Domine quod jubes, c.
Give but power to obey,
and what thou wilt com|mand.
Death is as hatefull to
man, as old age to beautie;
and we are ever complai|ning
of the shortnesse of
our time, unlesse calami|tie
make it seeme long;

which yet if they be ne|ver
so little over, they are
weary of that which be|fore
they wished for,
death: as I will not be in
love with tribulations, so
I will not love my life the
worse for them, nor the
better for wanting them:
if prosperity make me fond
of living, or afraid of dy|ing,
it had been better for
mee, if it had not been so
well; I shall pay deare
for my ease.
It is better to go into the
house of mourning, than in|to
the house of laughter;
nay, the way to the house

of laughter, is through
the house of mourning; so
our Saviour, Blessed are
they that mourne, for they
shall be comforted: Mirth,
like Salomons strumpets,
leads to the chambers of
death; and the voluptu|ous
man goes out of this
World, as hee came into
it, crying; and into ano|ther
world, where there
is nothing but weeping. It
is a great weaknesse to
defer to doe that, which
must be done, if I must
once weepe, I will doe it
now. It is better to cry
for remorse, than for an|guish.

There were no such
tyrant upon earth, as the
envious man, if he had but
his will, no man should
live a quiet life, or dye a
naturall death, but him|selfe;
hee sees his neigh|bours
house burning, and
warmes him by the fire,
and is refreshed: there is
no estate that he hath not
a quarrell to, no person;
his equals hee hates, be|cause
they are his equals;
his inferiors, because they
are not his equals; and
his superiors, because he is
not their equall: he is an
enemy to all mens peace,

but most of all to his own,
and I think if he were put
to it, himselfe knowes
not what hee would be,
or have others be. It is
the greatest vanity in the
world, to runne mad for
others pleasures: what if
I have not the same thing,
or in the same measure?
I have enough to serve
my turne, if they have
more, yet they must ac|count
for it, and I will
never envy any man, that
he hath more to answere
for to God, than I have;
I shall not account for
the talents which I never
had.

Gods blessings, and our
thankes must ever goe
hand in hand, one good
turne requires another.
Wee must not thinke to
serve our selves of God,
and not serve Him; His
blessings are not only en|couragements,
or rewards,
but bonds. Of these, the
more we have, the more
we owe, and our care must
be, not onely to receive,
but to repaie. Why
should we strive to come
out of every mans debt,
but GODS.
The charity of forgi|ving,

is more difficult
than that of giving, and
more worth, by how
much our selves are more
deare to us than our
goods, in the one wee are
doers, but in the other
sufferers, and many a man
would doe for another,
that would not suffer for
him: I am but halfe a
Christian if I have only
learn'd to pitie, and not
to forgive: we cannot at
once, remember our pro|fession,
and our wrongs,
if they bee small, the
matter is the lesse; if they
be great, our glorie is the
more: nor only our glo|rie,

but our reward; it is
our owne faults, if wee
be not gainers by our in|juries.
Gluttony is not onely a
sinne, but a disease: not
onely to be forbidden, but
to bee afraid of; other
sinnes hurt in future, this
in present, and robbes not
only of eternall life, but of
this, and destroies the bo|dy
together with the soule.
Our bodies were not gi|ven
for cellarage, to lay
in bread and beare in. I
will remember, that I
was not therefore borne,
or doe live, meerely to

eate and drinke; but there|fore
eate and drinke, that
I may continue life.
I have seldome known
any wickednesse so hai|nous,
that had not clients
as well as patrons. Corah
had co~panions with him
in his sinne, before in his
punishment. But innocency
doth not go by voices, I
will never looke at my
partners, but my cause. I
desire no other Advo|cates,
but GOD and the
truth.
It was the accusation
of the old world, that they

were eating and drinking,
till they entred, c. and is
still of this, and will be
so to the end, though this
were not the end of our
being, but for the conti|nuance
of it: I will use
my meat, as others doe
their Physicke, onely for
health, to satisfie not my
desire, but my stomach. I
can a great deale cheaper,
and safer, feede my belly
than my eye.
We see men set not
their best wares upon the
stalls, but within, lapp'd up;
it is neither commendable,
nor wise to shew our ex|cellencies

(as Musicians do)
in all companies; what
are we the better, that we
thinke well of our selves
while others thinke not
so? Or what are we then
worse, that others thinke
meanly of us, while we
think so too? Since those
art never the better for
thy selfe-conceitednes, nor
the worse for thy humi|litie,
why shouldst thou
make thy selfe envied for
those graces which thou
hast, by shewing them, and
derided for making shew
of those thou hast not,
and would'st seeme to
have? and art at once

noted of men for a boa|ster,
and of God for a dis|sembler?
I will be con|tent
to be lowly in mine
owne esteem, and others,
that I may bee high in
Gods.
A handsome garment
is no argument of a strait
body: those are not al|waies
the best men that
make the most shew of
holinesse. Demurenesse
may stand with falshood:
Pretences are evermore
suspicious; they that are
ever perfum'd, 'tis to be
thought have naturally
ill breaths, we must not

ever beleeve our senses:
goodnesse is plaine, and
would be knowne by her
workes, but not tell of
them, whilest hypocrisie
is painted to hide 'its
wrinkles, and would bee
taken for better than it is,
and with the figge-tree, it
shall be curst for flouri|shing;
if wee are true
Christians, wee are both
sides alike.
Goodnesse doth not
go by yeeres; many times
you shall have that from
a Samuel in his long
coates, which you shall
not have from a Saul, at

forty yeeres old; and yet
it is not forwardness com|mends
us, but perseve|rance:
Some men, like
some fruits promise faire
in the blossome, but wither
ere they be pluck'd; others
like some graine, lye long
in the ground, but grow
up the taller; it is dange|rous
to deferre long, but
it is worse not to hold
out. I will love and en|devour
early holinesse; yet
it is better to begin late,
than to have done betimes,
there is a penny for him
that comes at the eleventh
houre: If thy youth have
been faulty, it is comfort

that thy age is otherwise.
It is no disparagement to
have beene wicked, but to
continue so; who hath not
bin overseen sometime?
Hee was once a Persecutor
that was after an Apostle.
I will glorie, not that
I have never done a|misse,
but that I am now
asham'd of it.
As promotion, so pover|tie,
is neither from the
East, nor from the West;
but from God. Hee hath
sayd to every man, rule
thou here, or worke thou
there, bee this, or thus.
Why doe men grudge at

their wants, when it is
not chance but provide~ce?
It is lesse praise to be ho|nourable,
than to be con|tent
not to bee so: our
happinesse is, not to want
affliction, but to beare it.
The lesse I have, the more
I have to come: no Laza|rus
would change states
with that Dives, who if
he might but live againe,
would bee Lazarus to
choose.
Iob in his description
of man, sayes, His daies
are as the daies of an hire|ling,
now wee doe not
hire men to be idle, but

to doe our businesses, our
life is a long day, and this
day hath many houres,
and these houres have all
worke; every man is a
day-labourer, and must
doe his taske, to have his
wages. I doe not see the
penny given to those that
stand in the market place,
but that labour in the vine|yard:
'tis not for us to be
lookers on, GOD and the
holy Angels are specta|tors;
we must be actors,
doers. I will bee content
to do nothing but labour,
while I am here, that here|after
I may doe nothing
but rest.

The food of the soule,
as it is farre more excel|lent
than that of the bo|dy,
so it is farre more
dangerous; for, where it
saves not, it kills: How
many (with Esau) have
eaten themselves out of
the blessing in this, and
gone from Gods table, as
Baltazar did fro~ his con|demn'd
men? Not the
presence, but the prepared|nesse
makes the accep|tance:
to come, and not
worthily, is to bee more
bold than welcome; it is all
one to thee whether God
have thy roome, or thy

company; if thou have not
thy garment, thou art
condemn'd in both; let
others care only to come,
my care shall bee to be
welcome.
GOD is a God of pure
eyes, and cannot behold
sinne, and yet He conti|nually
beholds us that
are altogether sinful. Lord
how are we bound to thy
goodnesse, that onely thy
eye is upon us, and not
thy hand? That thou do|est
but take notice of our
sinnes, and not take ven|geance
on them? If wee
had any good nature in

us, if for nothing else, yet
we would be better, be|cause
thou art so good;
and dislike sinne, not for
our owne sakes, but thine.
GOD, saies the Hea|then,
hath woollen feet, but
iron hands; yet He hath
sometimes iron feet, and
woollen hands; where He
would correct, and not in
wrath, He makes a great
noyse, but doth little, only
to fright, not hurt them:
Where Hee will judge,
and not correct, He treads
softly, but strikes home,
and is upon them ere
they are awares; there is

love in His corrections,
but there is wrath in His
judgements. I will pray,
Correct mee, oh Lord, but
not in thy furie, lest I bee
consumed and brought to
nothing.
There is no living
without repenting; for all
sins are against God, and
all forgivenesse is from
God, and there is no for|givenesse
without repen|tance;
so then without
this thou canst neither
live comfortably, nor dye
peaceably. I will not pre|sently
give God and my
selfe over, because I have

sinn'd; but I will there|fore
neither give God o|ver
till He have forgiven
my sinne; nor my selfe
till I have forgotten it, or
remember it with dete|station.
I have seldome seene
a rich man want friends,
or a poore man enemies;
though He have scarce to
live, yet he is grudg'd his
life, that hee takes up
roome in the earth: these
men make much of this,
for it is all they have to
trust to. I will grudge
no man this world; it shall
suffice me there is ano|ther

to come, and that
mine shall beginne, when
this is ended. I will bee
content to want this for a
while, that I may enjoy
the other for ever.
Holinesse is not borne
with us, nor doth growe
up with us: sometime,
you shall see the hoare-head,
come short almost
of the long coates. I will
never regard how long I
live, but how well; and
rejoice, not that I dye an
old Christian, but an old
man in CHRIST.

Some men drawe nigh
unto God, but with their
lips, as Iudas did; others
drawe nigh unto Him
with their whole bodie,
and will for outward
complement come short
of none: into their sack|cloath
with Ahab, and
downe upon their knees
with face with Saul; they
will dye the death of the
Righteous as well as any,
if wishes will doe it; but
their heart is not sound.
Not to drawe nigh un|to
GOD at all, is open
rebellion; to drawe nigh
unto GOD, and not all,

by halves is secret dissem|bling;
then only doe wee
come as we should, when
wee come (like S. Pauls
Sacrifice,) our selves, our
soules and our bodies: and
thus if I draw nigh un|to
God, He will draw nigh
unto me.
If God only saw as we,
there were no difference
between holinesse in jest,
and in good earnest. Ahab
is in ashes as well as Ni|nivie;
nay, what doth
Ninivie more than Ahab,
to the eye? What doe
the Apostles more than
the Pharisies, or Iohns dis|ciples

than theirs? they
fast, pray, give: by the
out-side wee cannot tell
who serves God with his
bodie, or with his heart;
wee see they are painted,
God onely sees they are
sepulchers; wee see their
fairenesse, but not their
rottennesse; onely GOD
which sees their heart,
shall one day unmaske it,
and as they have before
been applauded for what
they seemed, so they shall
then be punish'd for what
they are. If I have only
the rin'd, the out-side of
Christianity, and not the
bulke, I am sure to be cast

out: what I can, I will so
carry my selfe, as I may
neither bee condemn'd
for beeing worse than I
should be, or seeming bet|ter
than I am.
There is no musike
like that of the Word, yet
it is not lik'd; we have pi|ped
unto you, and you have
not danced; was the com|plaint
of Christs time:
men have eares to heare,
but not that; any musike
but that of the Cymbals;
any Harpe but Davids;
any Bells but those of A|aron:
they can heare o|thers
revil'd, or God pro|phan'd,

or themselves
sooth'd; they have eares
to their commendations,
but not to their faults: the
sluggard hath his eares in
his pocket; the drunkard
hath his eares in his pot;
the proud man hath no
eares, but to his commen|dation;
the covetous man
hath no eares but to his
profit; the luxurious man
hath no eares but to his
pleasure; there is no mu|sike
but in trumpets, nor
in them but at banquets.
But he that will not heare
now, shall one day crie
and not be heard, and be
forc'd to heare that heavy

doome, Depart from me,
ye workers of iniquitie, in|to
that lake, where there is
nothing but crying.
It is strange, no men
would be sicke, and yet
some men will not bee
well; for they take cour|ses
to overthrow their
health; as if God had no|thing
to doe but to waite
on them: they are never
well when they are well,
but when they are doing
of ill; where the affli|ction
is Gods, wee may
challenge Him of helpe;
where the disease is de|bauchnes,
He may chal|lenge

us of sinne: when
our sicknesse is His cor|rection,
it is comfortable,
but when we need to bee
corrected for our sick|nesse
it is fearefull: what
God laies upon us is to be
boarne; what men bring
upon themselves, is not
to be answered; and if in
mercy thou art delive|red,
Go and sinne no more,
lest a worse thing come un|to
thee.
Ill weeds grow apace;
wicked men like Aegypti|an
grashoppers ly in heaps,
when the good, like Noah
in his Arke, are two or

three in a corner: our
blessed Saviour (as Hee
could never say other|wise)
said true, The way
had neede be wide that
leadeth to destruction,
for many there bee that
finde it.
They must looke to
suffer, that look to reigne;
this world is Gods house
of correction for His
Children: wee must not
think not to have crosses,
wee must studie to make
the best of them. I will
thinke of afflictions be|fore
they come, that
when they come, I may

bid them welcom; while
they tarrie, I will make
use of them, and when
they go, I will take leave
of them, onely as of an
Ague, for a well day or
two, but to come againe.
In Heaven all vessells
shall be full, but none shall
runne over; here on earth
I see some runne over,
and yet complain of emp|tinesse;
they have not en|ough,
if they have not
all: Thus I have seene
some beasts, not knowing
when they were well,
burst with feeding: they

had more than enough, if
they could be content a|nother
should have more
than they; if they could
but be lesse envious, they
would be lesse covetous:
all Vessels beare not the
same sailes, those do but
speed a tall Ship, where|with
a Bark is overborn:
wee know not our owne
strength, submitte our|selves
to Him that doth:
Hee that gives us all wee
have, knowes we have all
we should have, and that
if wee had more, wee
would sinke: that man
that thinkes hee is never
full, is never thankfull.

Whether I abound, or am
poore, I will endevour but
these two, to be thankfull,
and to be content.
Crosses are harsh, but
they are the best Physike;
I know not whether pro|sperity
have lost, or adver|sity
recover'd more; none
praies so heartily for His
daily bread, as Hee that
wants it: miserie like Io|nah's
fish sends them to
their prayers that never
thought of GOD under
their goard; it is pitty faire
weather should doe any
harm; yet it is often seen,
we even adore those Phy|sicians

in our sicknesse
which being recovered,
wee onely salute with a
complement; abundance
makes many forget those
friends, which want wold
make crouch to; how
welcom should that state
be which makes us fami|liar
with God? I will not,
I may not wish for affli|ctions,
nor meet them.
I am good Christian en|ough,
if I can be content
to be poore, and not de|sirous.
Our practice must
be not to make much of
crosses, but to make use
of them; yet I had ra|ther
endure a world of

crosses to come to God,
than to be crossed in no|thing
in this world, and
once want him: let my
sinnes rather be punished,
then sooth'd: oh God, let
my hell be here.
CHRIST hath ma|ny
followers, but few dis|ciples;
GOD hath many
creatures, but few sonnes.
GODS flocke is a little
one, one of a family, two
of a tribe, like the Pro|phet
Esaiahs tall Tree,
heere and there a berrie
in the toppe of a bough:
there are many of Israel,
but few Israelites, many
that have Abraham to

their father, but a few his
children. Many that came
out of his loines, but few
that shall sit in his bo|some.
Goodnes goes not
by multitude: the many
followers may shew thy
greatnesse, not thy holi|nesse;
the most are com|monly
the worst. How
fondly then, how falsely
do any boast of the truth
of their religion by their
multitude?
Every thing, we say,
is the worse for wearing;
it is true of the world;
the older the more cor|rupt:
we are forewarn'd

of the last daies, that they
shall be notoriously wic|ked;
the world did al|most
begin with sinne,
but it shall end (in a
manner) with nothing but
sinne, and that in fire:
Here's our comfort, the
just are no part of the
world.
If we had not knowne
sinne, we had not knowne
sicknes, and now we know
not how to be wel of our
sinne, but by Him against
whom wee have sinned;
our health is from God,
our sicknesse is from our
selves: Heale thy selfe,

is only for that Physician
to whom it was upbrai|ded,
it is not Saul and his
witch, or Asa and his Phy|sicians
can prevent death
or a disease, without God;
all is originally from
him, yet derivatively by
meanes. I will use the one,
but I will trust onely the
other; if wee are confi|dent
either without them,
or in them, we presume.
Whilest we are here,
we are in continuall want
of somewhat, either our
mindes are sicke, or else
our bodies, diseases or dis|contents.
How should

wee long for that place,
where we shall enjoy no|thing
but rest, and want
nothing but a consumma|tion
of our rest?
This world is a lyer,
and he will find it so, that
serves it: riches like their
master, are full of deceit,
promise that they have
not. How many have
we seen that have thoght
no joy but in abundance,
have, after, ended their
joy where they begin to
abound, and at last envied
the quiet rest and merry
meales of their labou|rers?
To impatient, in|constant

mindes, the pre|sent
state is ever cumber|some,
and they would
change thogh for a worse;
If wee can but make the
best of our owne, and
thinke our selves well, e|ven
when others thinke
not so, wee are happy
men. Why should I think
that grievous which God
thinkes fit? If there were
no providence, I would
struggle: but now it is
hard to kicke against the
prickes. Lord, be it unto
thy servant according to
thy will.
Pleasures are pleasing,

but they are vanishing:
the Pharisies were not so
truly painted sepulchers,
as these, faire but rotten,
fading nor onely dying,
but killing. Like guilded
pills (save that they are
not Physicke) but small,
and ill tasted; if they were
either not short, or but
sweet, there were some
colour for loving them.
But now they are not la|sting,
and yet unsavoury:
Why are we not ambiti|ous
of those pleasures,
which are beyond al time
for length, and all conceit
for sweetnesse?

Some men are afraid to
sinne, because they are a|fraid
to smart for their
sinne, they would goe on
in their sinnes, if they
could go away with them;
it doth not so much trou|ble
them to be wicked, as
to be tormented, and their
study is not that they
may not provoke God, but
that they may run away
from Him. Oh God, if
we could runne out of the
world, we should run far|ther
into thy judgements.
Oh God, if we go downe
into hell, thou art there,
there is no running from

the punishment, till from
the sinne.
All sicknesse is not of
the body: every leprosie is
not in the skinne, it were
well for some men it
were: every sinne is a dis|ease,
our soules are no
lesse subject to infection,
than our bodies; some are
diseas'd and do not know
it, others are diseas'd and
doe not care for it: both
cases are hard, but the
last is desperate. To make
light of sin, and because
thy soule is sicke even un|to
death, to say with the
Atheist Epicure, Let us

eat and drinke, for we must
dye, is to shake hands with
vengeance: Hee that will
not so much as aske to be
heal'd; how justly shall
he dye in his leprosie.
It is strange, but it is
ordinary to see every man
greedy to continue this
life, and not to procure a
better: If the head doe
but ake, strait to the Pro|phet
with the Shunamite,
to the Physicians with
Asa: If they bee but
talk'd to of dying, with
Ieroboam's wife they run
and ride, and send; and
as the Cripple to our Sa|viour,

pul downe the tiles
to come at him; but in
the matter of their soule,
they are deafe to the dis|ease:
why are wee not as
industrious for Heaven,
as for our health; and to
live ever, as to live long?
Alas! what is age with|out
goodnesse, but a fairer
marke for vengeance?
What is Dives the bet|ter
to out-live LAZA|RVS,
and at last dye and
be damn'd? Let others
trouble themselves and
the world, how to main|taine
this body, my care
shall bee how to subject
it: whilest I employ my

soule only for the setting
out of my flesh, what am I
else but a glorious slave?
Diseases though they
were the fruit of sinne,
and brought upon us by
our selves, yet they are
not dispos'd of amongst
us but by God, they head
doth not ake but with his
leave: nor leave aking
but with His helpe; it is
from above both that
wee are sicke, and that
wee are made whole; to
whom should I not only
owe my life, but bestow
it, but to him of whom
I live and move?

As it is in extremities,
for men to remember
God, but with repining;
so it is hard in prosperity,
to remember themselves,
and what they have re|ceiv'd
of God; we are apt
to forget what wee have
bin, when we are chang'd
for the better; Pharaoh's
butler hath forgot he was
a prisoner: it is too true,
that too many love God
for their owne sakes, ei|ther
they are poore, and
would be rais'd; or they
are sicke and would bee
heal'd; and like beggers,
no sooner are they serv'd

but they are gone. I may
both love my selfe, and
God; I may not love God
for my selfe, I would not
love my selfe but for that
I am His, and I will love
Him but for Himselfe.
When I consider the
yeeres I have already li+ved,
me thinkes they are
few, but evill; evill not in
respect of affliction alone,
but of sin, and I am found
guilty: if I consider the
present, (if there be any
present, when it is ever
passing) I do but adde to
my score, and if I consi|der
the time to come (if

I have any to come, God
knowes) I do but adde to
the measure of my owne
sinnes, and Gods wrath
together with my yeeres;
since I must live, and can|not
but sinne, I will stu|dy
how my sinnes may
not hinder me of a better
life; first, I will abhorre
them, and then I will ab|horre
my selfe for them;
and if I could not before
break my heart of them,
I will now breake it for
them: A broken and a con|trite
heart, O God, thou
wilt not despise.

To every one it shall
one day be sayd; Give an
account of thy stewardship,
c. It is that which
everie man should tell
himselfe and one tell ano|ther,
what the Apostle
hath long since told us
all, that we must all stand
before the tribunall seate
of Almightie GOD;
the righteous thinkes long
of this day, and longs
for it; because hee is
long since provided for it;
the wicked thinks it coms
too fast, and yet thinkes
not of it till it come; and
when it is come, can
think of nothing but that,

and is stown'd with the
thought of it: his plea|sures
which were never
but shadowes (yet accoun|ted
recall) then appeare as
they were, and not as they
were accounted; and those
torments which were ever
thought but shadowes, bug-beares,
then appeare as
they are, and prove reall:
the comparing of what
he hath enjoi'd, with what
he hath lost, and that lit|tle
lesse than nothing of
time which he hath liv'd,
with the eternitie of tor|ment,
hee is to dye in,
makes him curse the time
of his birth, since there

is a time of death, and a|nother
death beyond all
time; so the godly and the
wicked differ not more in
their lives, than in their
deaths, but most of all
after death. Oh my God!
as thou hast made mee
of the best sort of crea|tures,
a man, and of the
best of that sort, a chri|stian;
so let mee be yet
better, by beeing one of
those whom thou hast
sorted for thy selfe; what
am I better, if I am only
call'd and not chosen.
All bookes are not a|like
easie; those that are,

are not all alike profita|ble;
some would profit
more, if they did but rel|lish,
others would rellish
better, if they were more
profitable; he doth well
that doth both, utile dulci;
I will neither drowne my
meat in sauce, nor dish it
dry.
They are not the only
robbers that breake hou|ses,
guile is worse theft
than outrage; it is alike
wicked to make wine of
other mens grapes (as A|hab
did of Naboth's) and
to be drunk of our owne;
hee that will have riches

in spight of heaven shall
have hell to boote.
The malicious man is
his owne moth; that God
is better to him than hee
can expect, is nothing,
whilest He is better to o|thers
than Hee is to him:
like Gideon's first miracle
hee would have all the
ground dry but his fleece;
if Cain's sacrifice miscary,
Abel must not bee accep|ted
and live; no man may
bee either greater or bet|ter
with safetie. I will not
looke at what I have, but
what I deserve, and I shall
never thinke my owne

little, or anothers too
much: that is a wicked
heart that would have
all men worse than it selfe,
and hates all those whom
others thinke better.
God is therfore boun|tifull
to us, that we might
be so to others; to feast
those, that cannot bid us
againe, and to build for
those that cannot lodge
us againe, is the way to
that marriage-feast, and
those buildings, whose
Builder  Maker is God:
he alone hath the true use
of wealth that receives
it onely to disburse it; if

of wealth that receives it
only to disburse it; if men
were their owne friends
they would make others
so with this Mammon;
why should the rust of
that gold rise up in judge|ment
against thee, the
use of which will set thee
with those that shall sit
in judgement?
Persecution is the dore
to happines, Canaan hath
still the same way, a wil|dernesse;
who can looke
for heaven cheape, that
sees his SAVIOVR blee|ding?
I may not afflict
my selfe, yet I shall su|spect

my selfe without
affliction; calmes are
no lesse dangerous than
stormes.
Some men doe not
climbe, but vault into
preferment at a leape; I
know not their sleight, I
mistrust their quicknesse;
few men were ever great
and good in an instant.
All the harme I wish
these, is, that their early
rising do them no harme;
they that are their owne
brokers in these, are like|ly
their owne theeves in
better; and steale them|selves
out of heaven.

Favours are more bin|ding,
but aflictions are
more profitable; to have
much is more glorie, but
to be content with that
we have is more victory;
there is no conquest like
that of our selves, no con|quest
of our selves like
that of want; it is a hard
matter not to find pover|ty
a burden, or prosperity
a snare; this religion ob|tains
us, that if we are not
richer than others, yet we
are content to be poorer;
he only hath enough that
would have no more.

Our endevors are in
vaine without God's bles|sing,
yet in vaine shall he
challenge a blessing that
endevors not; sloth is
no lesse guiltie than cove|teousnesse.
I can doe no|thing
without God, yet I
will not looke God shall
doe all.
The cause of all pu|nishment
is sinne; and
the end of all sinne is pu|nishment.
Either pre|sent
or to come; how
then doe we love to be
punished, and yet love
to sinne? if we could but
be innocent, we could not

but be safe; while I am
here I cannot but sinne,
but I hope to avoid the
punishment through Him
who hath borne the pu|nishment
and the sinne.
Our life is but a breath;
at first God breath'd up|on
man the breath of life,
c. And it is gone with a
breath, if He breath upon
us in displeasure we die,
for at the breath of His
nostrills wee are all con|sum'd:
since we doe not
live but by His leave,
why doe we not live to
His glorie? Oh God, I
have not liv'd long, yet

so much of my life as I
have not liv'd to thee, I
have liv'd too much; all I
desire is, that as this life
was thy gift to me, so it
may be my gift to thee; I
I can afford God little, if
not His owne.
All punishments are
from the same hand, Iobs
boyles are no lesse Gods
finger than Pharaohs; but
all are not with the same
end; those are but chast|nings
upon some, that are
judgements upon others.
God strikes His owne be|cause
He loves them, He
strikes the wicked because

they love not Him; those Hee
corrects but these He executes; it
is a signe Hee loves us when Hee
strikes us, and if his strokes bring
us to love him, wee may brag
with David, it is good for us that
we have beene afflicted.
God is all eare and all eye, and
all in all; grant Lord, that as I am
alwaies seene of thee, so I may be
alwaies heard of thee: and may
alwaies heare thee in thy Word,
and contemplate thee in thy
workes; that I may one day see as
I am seene, and heare and bee
heard in that heavenly quire of
Hallelujah's, Glorie, and power,
and honour be unto the Lambe, and
to Him that sitteth on the Throne,
for evermore. Amen.
FINIS.
