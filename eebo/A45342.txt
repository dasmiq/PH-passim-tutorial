To the Candid and Courteous Reader.
_OBserving that dan|gerous Tenent of the Anabaptists to spread like a Gan|grene, over most parts of the land,Samuel How, the preaching Cobler, or the cobling prea|cher, is full of such tat|chings, viz. that the seven liberal Scien|ces are but profane, vaine bablings. How's suffici|ency of the spi|rits teaching. viz. That Arts, Sciences, Languages, c. are Idols, An|tichristian, the smoak of the bot|tomlesse Pit, filth, froth, dung, needlesse and uselesse for the right understanding of the Scripture: the spirit alone (say

they) is sufficient without these humane helpes,Some igno|rant people would have all men as ignorant as themselves, that so their owne igno|rance might not be discove|red. Like those whom St Ierom taxeth, who accounted rusticity and lack of learning, to be sanctity. Crassam illi rusticitatem solum pro sanctitate habent. Hieron. Epist. 84. 102. ad Mar|cellum. To the un|derstan|ding of the formale ex|ternum, or letter of Scripturo, Arts and Tongues are necessary, as the assistance of the holy Ghost is to the formale internum, or genuine sence of it. Waterhouse Apol. page 7. and therefore the Taylor-King of Leyden, burnt all books save the Bible. I shall therefore take some pains to discover the vanity of this erroneous Tenent, that I may prevent (if possible) the sad con|sequences of it; to this end I shall shew, 1. What we grant them,  how far we go. 2. Where we part.
1. We willingly grant that the assistance and direction of Gods holy spirit, is absolutely necessary for the sound and sa|ving

understanding of the Scripture. 'Tis it that must in|lighten, enliven, sanctify, and fit us for the work, for without him we can do nothing, Iohn 15.5.
2. As we acknowledge that this guift comes from the spirit of God, so we likewise acknow|ledge, that he bestows it now in the use of meanes; by Prayer, Reading, Study, skill in Arts, Sciences, Languages, c. True, in the Apostolicall times, God poured out an extraordinary measure of his spirit on many, who had Learning and Langua|ges by immediate infusion, wee now by acquisition; they had it Given, we Gotten; they by Reve|lation and Inspiration, we now

by Industry and Study: and yet even then we read that Paul had his Books and Parchments,Libros vocat ve|tustiores ab aliis scriptos; mem|branas recentio|res  se con|scriptas  Lap. Apparet Aposto|lum jam morti vicinum non ta|men  lectione destitisse; hinc rfllitur fana|ticorum uror, qui libris con|temptis damna|taque omni le|ctione selos suos  joctant. Calvin Noverat Timo|thy diligent-am,  tamen illi commendat assi duam lectio|nem. Idem. 2 Tim. 4.13, 15. which some con|ceive to be Note books of his own making; and in the person of Timothy he commands all Ministers to give attendance to Reading, Meditation, c. and to give up themselves wholly to them, , be in them. (1) Be intent and industrious in studying, sis totus in illis 1. He must read, and then exhort, that like a good scribe he may bring out of his treasury, things both new and old. 2. Hee must meditate on these things, and so digest them, turning them in succum  sanguinem, that

so he may be able to speak non ex ore, sed  pectore, experi|mentally, powerfully. God hath ordained meanes for the attai|ning of every thing, and he that contemns the meanes, con|temns the blessing; 'tis Gods blessing on the diligent hand, which as in all other things, so in this, doth make men rich; as nemo casu fit bonus, so nemo casu fit doctus, virtus discen|da est,Divina summ indigent dili|gentia thesau|rus no in su|perficie, sed pro|fundo recondi|tur. Chrysost. saith Seneca: We must therefore, so Read, Study, Search, c. as if we were to doe all our selves, and yet when we have done all, so rest upon God for aid, as if we had done nothing. Truth like Treasure, lies deep and hidden, and cannot

be found without search, and stu|dy; we must therefore serve pro|vidence in the use of meanes, else we tempt God, Pro. 2.3, 4, 5.Admot manu invocand est Minerva. We come now to understand Scripture by ordinary meanes of stu|dy, learning, prayer, c. not by extraordi|nary revelati|on. See Doctor Hammond in his Preface to his Annotat. on the New Test. If thou criest after know|ledge, there is Prayer, and see|kest her as silver, there is in|deavour in the diligent use of meanes; then shalt thou under|stand the feare of the Lord, there is successe; and therefore it was a good Prayer of Sir Thomas Moor, Domine Deus fac me in iis conse|que~dis operam collocare pro quibus obtinendis soleo ad te orare. 3. Wee grant that the abuse of Philosophy, when it is preferred before Divini|ty, or puffs men up with pride,

or is used to adulterate and cor|rupt the truth and simplicity of the Gospell, that then it is odious and abominable. But this is not our question, whe|ther the abuse of Philosophy be unlawfull, this is gran|ted on all hands: But the question between us and the Anabaptists, is, whether the right and sober use of Phi|losophy,See the neces|sity and excel|lency of hu|mane learning Dr Reynolds Preface to the Passions. and other humane Learning be requisite for a Di|vine. This we affirm, the Anabaptists, c. deny. I shall therefore set down this Anti|thesis to their Thesis, and will confirme it by Argu|ments, viz. That the know|ledge of Arts, Sciences, Hi|story,

Languages, c. are very usefull and needfull qua|lifications for a Minister of the Gospell.





CHAPTER I.
_I Come now to the Ar|guments, for the clea|e convincing of our judgements, in the truth of this point. The first is drawne from the necessity of humane Learning: Thus,
That which is necessary for a Di|vine, may not be contemned, [whe|ther the necessity be absolute, or onely of expediency.]
But humane Learning is necessary for a Divine, Ergo, It may not be con|temned.
The Major no sober man will deny: The Minor I will prove by its parts. 1. The Languages, Latine, Greek and Hebrew, are some part of hu|mane

learning,Et si sine ill quidam non in|utiles Ecclesiis fuerunt, cum tamen lingua illa totius Chri|stianismi quasi quoddam com|mune sit vincu|lum,  omnes pen ingenioum faetus in hac lingua sint edi|ti, mutilam oportet esse cog|nitionen quae si|ne hujus linguae notiti habetur. Walaeus and these are necessa|rie for a Divine 1. For Latine, many learned Commentaries are written in that language, which a man cannot en|joy without some knowledge of this Tongue; besides, many English words of much use in Divinity, are borrowed of the Latine, which no man can well understand without some insight in this Language.
2. The Greek tongue is necessary, because the New Testament was writ|ten in it; besides, many Latine words are derived from it, which we cannot fully understand without some know|ledge here: also many termes of Art (in Grammer, Rhetorick, Logick, Phy|sicks, Metaphysicks, c.) are borrow|ed from hence. What grosse errors did many of the Antients run into, and what lame interpretations, doe they oft make, for want of insight in the Originall Languages; yea we had ne|ver enjoyed the translation of the Bi|ble, if some men had not attained this part of humane Learning, the Bible would have been as a sealed book; for how could men, women, and children be able to read the Scripture, had there

not been learned men, who by great paines and study obtained the know|ledge of the Originals?
3. Some insight in the Hebrew is necessary, because it is that sacred Language in which the Old Testament was written,Habet omnis linguae sua pro|pria locutinum genera, quae cum in aliam lin|guam transfe|runtur, viden|tur absurda. Hyperiu l. 2. obs. 6. p. 117. besides it hath a certaine Idiome, and peculiar form of speaking, which cannot well be expressed in a translation, without some losse; all Authors being best and purest in that Language, in which themselves writ. 2. The emphasis and force of the word is more clearly seen in the Origi|nall Text,Propter inter|pretum diver|sitats cognitio Hebrae  Graecae linguae est necessaria. Augustin. then in a translation. 3. There ar great differences amongst Inter|preters, which cannot well be recon|cild without some insight in the origi|nals. Thus, in points of controversie, when one saies it is thus, and another thus,Cognitio fonti~|um necessaria est. 1. quando  explicare volu|mus. 2. ut plures sensus inveni|amus. 3. ut idi|mata, phrases,  proverialinguae sanctae cognos|camus. 4. ut menda corriga|mus. 5. ut quae|dam loca melis intelligamus. 6. ut Latini sermonis ambi|guitatem vite|mus. Mel. Can. l. 2. c. 15. we must then of necessity have re|course to the fountains. 1. Because they are immediately sent from God to us by the Prophets and Apostles. 2. The Apostles themselves did sometimes correct the translation of the 70 e. g. the 70 say I have called my sonnes; but Ma. 2.15. saith, I have called my son out of Egypt. 3. He that understands

the Originall, seeth with his owne eyes, when he that peruseth translati|ons, sees with the eyes of others. Scit  san claris. ille Whitaker. de Scriptu|r controvers. 1. Qu. 2. cap. 9. mihi p. 210.

2. The necessity of Arts and Scien|ces, will appear if we look into the bo|dy of the Scripture. 1 There are phy|sicks in Genesis, Iob, Ecclesiastes; how oft doe we read in Scripture, of the Sunne, Moon, Stars, Fire, Haile, Snow, Winds, Thunder, Lightnings; and also of Fowles, Fishes, Beasts, Plants, Trees, Seas, Fountaines, Minerals; besides, many diseases, as the Leprosie, Palsi, Feaver, Pestilence, c. Without some

insight in naturall Philosophy, we can|no so exactly know the nature of all these yea we shall find Ethicks in the Proverbs, and Oeconomicks in Pauls Epistles; Politicks in Sam. Kin. Geo|metry in the building of Solomons Tem|ple, and Astronomie in Iob, c. with Metaphysicks of God,Metaphysica~ ad Theologos jam adultiores re|mitto, quia ci|tra firmos at in Theologia ex|ercitatos sensus errorum faecun|da est nutrix.

2. Grammer is requisite to explain the words, termes, and phrases of Scripture. 3. The Scripture also is ful of Rhetorick,Troporum cog|nitio scriptura|rum ambiguita|tibus dissolven|dis est necessa|ria. Aug de Doct. Christ. lib. 3. caep. 28. many Tropes and Fi|gures are there, what abundance of Metonymies, Ironies, Hyperboles, Hy|pallages? See Illyrious Claris. Script. and Westhemerut. The Scripture is full of learning and Vide Rivet. Isagog. ad scrip. cap. 28. eloquence all the eloquence of Cicero, and flowers of Demosthenes, with the rest of those learned Heathen, is but as chaffe to wheat, and drose to refined gold: for the Pen-men of Scripture,See more fully Perkins on Heb. 11.12. page 9.94. were not simply men, but men inspired with the Holy Ghost.
4. Logick is necessary for analsing defining dividing, and more orderly re|solution of a Text; also for Argumen|tation and defence of the truth against an adversary. The Apostle would have a Minister  2 Tim. 2.15. to divide the word aright. Now, without

some skill in Arts, he'll rather teare it with his teeth, and pull it a sunder with his nailes, then rightly divide it; and although it be the spirit of God that helpeth us to the sence of Scripture, in a spirituall saving way, for we are not able by our will to beleeve it, to apply it, to conform to it; yet as it is a Text consisting of words, and a coherence to make up the sence;See more fully Perkins on Heb. 11.12. p. 93.94. so the instrumen|tall way to discover that, is by the help of Arts, and therefore those that are unlearned, are said to , set them on the rack to make them speak what they never meant.
Mr Ant. Bur|ges, Ser. 106. page 602. rest the Scrip|tures, 2 Pet. 3.16. to mangle and tor|ture them to their own destruction; as a , set them on the rack to make them speak what they never meant.
Mr Ant. Bur|ges, Ser. 106. page 602. reverend Divine hath wel observed neither is Logick a profane thing, (as some profane ones imagine) for the Scripture it selfe useth many Logicall Arguments, from the caue, the effect, the consequent, from mercies, judge|ments, and from the Old Testament, its written, c. e. g. God is a spirit, Erg he will be worshipped in spirit. So, he that commits sin is the servant of sin, but yee commit sinne, Erg. A good Shepherd laies down his life for his sheep: but I (saith Christ) am that good shepherd, Ergo, See a clear syllo|gisme

in the second figure, Iohn 8.47. Whosoever is of God, heareth Gods word, but yee heare not his word, Ergo, yee are not of God. This may stop the mouths o some that say Christ never used Lo|gick, nor had any humane learning.
5. Ecclesiasticall History is neces|sary; many things in Scripture receive light from Iosephus,Historia pluri|mm nos adju+vat ad sanctos libros intelligen dos. Aug. d Doct. Christ l. 2. cap. 28. Hyperius l 4. c. 2.
Bowles Pastor Evangel. l. 1. c. 19. p. 119. Eusebius, Q. Curti|us, Xenophon, besides, they will furnish a man with examples of Gods judge|ments on his enemies, and his blessings on his people; being rightly used, they will much enrich a man. They may be read at succisive houres for recreation, after strong labour. With what cauti|ons and conditions they are to be read, I shall for brevity sake, referre you to two learned Authors. Now as hu|mane learning is necessary for the bet|ter understanding of the Scripture, o without it we cannot understand many classicall Authors, as Lactantius, Ierom, Austin, Ambrose, Basil, c. who bor|rowed much of Cicero, Quintilian, Vir|gil: And thus we see the usefulnesse and ornament of learning every way; to which I shall add the testimonie of a sweet Divine,rough, .6.3. whose judgement may

peradventure take with some men, more then another mans. He that is learned in something, (saith he) covets after more still, and certainly none but ignorant people are enemies to lear|ning; those that never knew the worth of it, these are they that cry it down: therefore those that are contented with little, nay and think their little too much sometimes, are of poor, mean, and base spirits, far from follow|ing on to know the Lord.
Yea,Sam: How's sufficiency of the spirits teaching. Ob. 5. and Ob. 6. How himselfe confeseth. That humane learning being sanctified is an excellent helpe to the right understan|ding of Scripture, and that in it selfe it is a good thing, and good in its proper place, which is for the repairing of that decay which came upon man for sinne, and so it is fit for Statesmen, Physitians, Lawyers and Gentlemen, yea and all men so farre as they can attaine to it, are as men beyond and above others that are without it, yea and beyond all other excellencies that this world can afford. Well said and well sowed Sam: these stitches will hold; yet see how like a ight sectary he plaies fast and loose, like the curst Cow, that having

given a good messe of milk, knocks down all with her heels again: for mark his following words: But bring it once to be a help to understand the mind of God in holy Scriptures, and there its detestable lth dross and dung, good for nothing but to destroy, and cause men to erre. c.
Quo teneam vultus muantem Protea nodo.

The second ARGUMENT.
That which is commanded by God, and commended to us by the example of his servants, ought still to be practi|sed by us, [unlese any one can shew a counter-mand and prohibition, which in this case none ever yet could do.]
But reading, study, meditation and humane industry is commanded by God, and commended to us by the ex|ample of his servants, Ergo. The Ma|jor is undeniable, the Minor I prove by its parts. 1. Humane industry and lear|ning is commanded, 1 Tim 4.13, 15. give attendance to reading meditation, c. yea, he must give up himselfe wholly to them, that so like a good

scribe, he may be able to bring out of his treasury, things both new and old, Mat. 1352. Now look what Paul en|joynes Timothy, concerns all the Mini|sters of the Gospell successively to the end of the world; but to what end is all this diligence required, if the spirit's teaching were solely sufficient.
2. It is commended to us by the ex|ample of Gods servants, they are oft commended in Scripture for their skill and dexterity in humane learning. Thus Moses is said to be learned [,Moses eruditus fuit in omni, in omni sapientia, in omni sapien|tia Aegyptio|rum Prid. he was instructed therein from a child] in all the wisdome of the Egyptians, [amongst whom in those dayes lear|ning flourished much] and was mighty in words and deeds, Acts 7.22. Now the learning of the Egyptians is said to be foure-fold, viz. Mathematicks, Phy|sicks, Ethicks and Divinity; their wis|dome (what ever it was) appeares to be very great, for when the Lord would set forth the wisdome and great abilities of Solomon, he tels us that it excell'd al the wisdome of Egypt, 1 Kin. 4.3.
2. Solomon was a very great Philo|sopher, so that he could discourse from

the Cedar to the Shrub,Tractat Theolo|gica, Ethica, Oonomica, id verbis tam ppositis  sig|nificantibus, sententiis tam gravibus, figu|ri ade lepidis  scit pictu|ratis tropis, ut um non solm Philosophum summum,  summum Theo|logum, sed  summum oratorem ac potam necessario sint agnituri qui in ejus lectione cum judicio versabtur. Rivet. he had great insight in the nature and qualities of Fowle, Fish, Beasts, Herbs, Trees, inso|somuch, as they came from all the parts of the earth to hear his wisdome, 1 Kin. 4. 32, 33, 34. As he was most wise, so he was most eloquent, an absolute Orator, one that found out acceptable words, [Eccle. 12.10.] adorned with many Tropes and Figures, farre surpas|sing all the eloquence of Cicero, Demo|sthenes, c. Cum divina fuerit in eo eloquentia, in eum confluxisse par est credere, quicquid in variis olim oratori|bus seorsim emicuit suavitatem Socratis, subtilitatem Lysiae, acumen Hyperidis, sonitum Aeschinis, vim Demosthenis, gravitatem Africani, lenitatom Laeli,  siquid ale in laude positum sit,  elo|quentissimis quibusdam viris tributum  Cicerone lib. 3. de Oratore. Rivet.
3. I say (as 'tis conceived) Amos Isaiae pater, frater fuit regis Amasiae, qui unus fuit ex majoribus Chri|sti. Arcular. In magno hoc scriptore nihil est rusticum, ni|hil inconditum, nihil impropri|um, nihil eximio orature, i eximio pr+phet nono currit dign+mum. Rive sagog. ad s c. 28. p. 488 plura of the blood Royall, was an excellent Rheto|rician, and had the tongue of the lear|ned given him, Isaiah. 50.4 as appears throughout his whole Prophesie.
3. Christ himselfe honoured lear|ning so farre, (though he be not tied to Schools or means) as to sit amongst the

Doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions and in his disputations he used Logicall consequences and rea|sonings from the Old Testament to the New. The Apostles also had excel|lent abilities, insomuch, as the Phari|sees wondred that unlearned and igno|rant men should have such gifts, but by this they knew they had been with Jesus. [Acts 4.13.] and were trained up in his school, which is farre beyond all the schools of the Scribes and Pha|risees; they were not therefore simply unlearned, but onely in the Pharisees esteem, and in respect of the ordinary means of attaining learning.
4. Apollos is commended for his e|loquence, Acts 18.24. Ingenio valebat Dialectico, Mathematico,  Oratorio. Dr Prideaux concio. 3.
5. Daniel and his three associates, had knowledge and skill in all the lear|ning and wisdome of the Caldaeans, Dan. 1.4, 17. and though Daniel had a great measure of the spirit, yet it is worth observing, that he gave himselfe to study, and reading books for all this, Dan. 9.2. I Daniel understood by books the number of yeers, c. Yea so exqui|site

was he in all naturall, acquired, and spirituall perfections, that it was then a Proverb: Art thou wiser then Da|niel? Ezek. 28.3.
6. Paul was bred up at the feet of learned Gamaliel, and could speak lan|guages more then they all, 1 Cor. 14.18. He was so eloquent, that at Lystra he was taken for Mercury, the God of Eloquence, Acts 14.11. he was an ex|lellent Orator, as appears, Acts 26. and an excellent disputant; he disputes Philosophically at Athens, with the Philosophers: he was well versed in the writings of the Heathens; hence he cites Epimenides the Poet, to convince the Cretians,Veritas st ve+ritas  quocun|que dicatur. Tit. 1.12. and Aratus to convince the Athenians, Acts 17.28. and Menander to silence the Corinthi|ans, 1 Cor. 15.33. yea it is said of all the Prophets, that they used meanes by inquiring and searching into the Gospell, 1 Pet. 1.10. By all this it ap|pears, that Gods dearest servants for|merly, made use of humane learning in carying on the work of the Lord, and therefore we conclude it is lawfull and usefull still.



The third ARGUMENT.
Humane learning is necessary for the convincing and confuting of a learned adversary, how shall we be able to preserve the truth in its purity, to stop the mouth of a subtle Jesuite, or learned Heretick, without learning? This san|ctified and rightly improved, is an ex|cellent meanes to bring downe Anti|christs Kingdome; and therefore 'tis well observed, that errors were never higher, and truth lower, then when ig|norance prevailed, and learning was suppressed and contemned, when 'twas suspitious for a man to have Greek, and heresie it selfe to have Hebrew. Popery never fell, till learning rose; it's a darke Religion, it grows and spreads it selfe by ignorance and Barbarisme, no way so speedy to bring down these wals of Iericho, as the promoting of all kind of good literature and learning.
2. If we would convince an Hea|then, it's necessary that we have some knowledge of their Authors, that we may wound them with their own quils: this made Theodoret Triparttit. Hist. l. 6. c. 17. V plura apud Davenant in Col. 2.8. p. 183. Iulian complain, [Propriis

configimur pennis  nostris eni~ libris ar|ma capiunt, quibus in bello adversus no utunur.] And thereupon he made a Law, tha children should not read Phi|losophers or Poets.Ab thnicis si quid ben di|ctum, ab iis tan|quam ab inju|stis possessori|bu in usum nostrum est vin|dicandum. Non|ne aspicimus quanto auro  argentosuffarc|natus exierit de Aegypto Cypri|anus Dr. sua|ssimus,  Martyr beatissi|mus? quanto Lactantius? Victorinus, Op|tatus, Hilarius Aug. de doct. Christ. l. 2. c. 40. The Israelites fur|nisht themselves with the spoils of the Egyptians; David helpes himselfe with Goliath's sword; Paul strikes the Heathen with their owne writings, and makes their books like hand-maids to wait upon Divinity: therefore when he came to Athens amongst Philoso|phers, he disputes with them from their own principles, Acts 17.28.
3. If we would convince a Christi|an of his ingratitude, unrighteous dea|ling, stupidity, private-spiritednesse, c. it may be usefull sometimes to quicken our Auditors, by setting before them what excellent things very Heathens by the light of nature have done. Thus the Lord sends the revolting Jewes to learn better things of Heathens, Ier. 2.10. and sometimes sends us to the tea|ching of nature,Ben dicta Philosophorum sunt peculia Christianorum. Iust. Martyr. 1 Cor. 11.14. All that hath been said, may be summed up in this Argument, thus That which is necessary for the convincing of a lear|ned adversary, an Heathen and a de|boist

Christian may in no wise be con|temned.
But humane learning is necessary for the convincing of a learned adver|sary, an Heathen and deboist Christian, Ergo.


A fourth ARGUMENT.
A minri ad majas.Quomodo quis institueretur ad prudentiam hu|manam vel ad quemcun a|ctum sine literis, cum instrumen|tum sit ad om|nem vitam lite|ratura? Tert. de idol. If humane lear|ning be requisite for Lawyers, Politi|tians, Physitians, c. then (a fortiori) it is much more requisite for a Divine, [whose calling is more weighty, being about the soule, and therefore cals for the best accomplishments.]
But humane learning is necessary for Lawyers, Politicians Physitians, c. (according to Sam: Hows own con|fession) Ergo, I conclude it is much more necessary for a Minister.


A fifth ARGUMENT.
Holy men thus accomplisht are fit|test for Gods use;Apud Gacos nmosatis in|stuctus habitus est ad docendam religionem no|stram nisi ver|atus in Philo+sophicis discip+ns. Arctius. this appeares in all ages. God sends a leaned Moses and Aaro to oppose the learned Egypti|ans; he sends a learned Isaiah, Ieremy,

Ezekiel, to oppose the false Prophets: he raised up a learned Athanasius, to oppose Arrius: a learned Austin, to oppose Pelagius: a learned Iewell, Whitaker, Fulke, Perkins, c. to oppose the subtle Jesuites: a lear-Camero, Moulin, Ames, Twisse, c. to oppose Arminius, c. True God can extraordinarily worke by weake unlearned instruments, and out of the mouths of babes, and sucklings, can confound his foes; but ordinarily he fits and qualifies such as he appoints for high and noble implovment, with accomplish|ments answerable to their worke. God never sends any, but hee first fits and prepares them; all idle ig|norant sots he rejects, as none of his sending. Hosea 4.6. Dyers when they would colour Scarlet or Purple, doe first prepare the Cloath for it, by laying some ground colour: So those whom God in|tends for choise service, hee first prpares them and sharpens their wit by humane learning, that they may be vesels of honour fit for the Masters use. To make this plain by an

instance;Nec dubitamus, aeteris paribus, majrem  ple|rem mensuram communi|ari publicis cclsiae admi|nistris, ive in una aliqua par|ticulari, Ecclesi|a munn suum heant; sive in caet is aliquo le|gtime,  in Christi nomine congregato, de ve Scripturae sensu inter se cserant, quam singulis  pri|vats, qui neque tot dons instru|cti sunt, neque ot ocul vdent,  privat  siplic medita|one, aequare pssunt mulia|um collectio|nem  dsqui|sonem. Rivet. take two godly men of e|quall naturall abilities, they both have the spirit of God, we will suppose the one to be a private Christian, bred up to a Trade, wanting humane learning; but the other is bred up to learning, ac|complisht with Arts, Sciences, Langua|ges, c. give them both one Text, and equall time for preparation; though the good man that want learning-may deliver honest things yet for want of the languages, and other endowments, he's like a Pigmy to a Gian, c. The like may be said of their putations with a arned adversary A Carpenter may as well build a house without Ax|es, Hammers, and other instruments, as a man make Sermons the hath no lear|ning. And that all the world may see the folly of those Sctaies, which want humane learning; I shall here present you with a wese of Sam: How's non|squiturs the bare rehearsall of them is confutation sufficient, and thus he be|gins his cobling Logick. Moses forsook the treasures of Egypt. Erg, he forsook his learning too, which was a part of that treasure; Paul counted all but losse for Christ, Erg, he cast off his

learning for him. The Ephesian con|verts burnt their Magick books, [Act 19.18, 19.] Ergo, we must burn our Logick books. Beleevers shall all be taught of God, Erg, they need no hu|mane learning: humane learning puffs men up, Ergo, we must throw it away: the spirituall man discernes all things, Erg, he hath no need of humane lear|ning: God forbids us to add any thing to his word, Erg, away with humane learning: humane learning is attained by our own industry and paines, Ergo, away with humane learning, as being fitter for Egypt and Babylon, thefor the Church of Christ: Simon Magus must repent of his wickednesse, Ergo he must repent of his humane learning: God re|spects no mans person, Ergo, unlearned men are fitter for the Ministery, then learned: God chooseth the foolish to salvation, Ergo, he chooseth the foolish for administration: since the Gospell is foolishnesse, Ergo, it must have foolish Teachers.If there be any thing here that needs an answer, you shall have it in the answers he Objc Contraries must not be put together, but the Gospell and huane learning are contraries. That which is cursed, and we must beware of being spoiled by it, that must be abhorred,

but such is Philosophy, Col .8. There's a great woe fals on the world. Rev. 9 1. to 11. Now, part of this woe is humane learning, the very smoak of the bottomlesse pit, Ego. Thus wee see what it is to want humane learning, and how this mans illogicall conse|quences do agree, like Harpe and Har|row, and come as neer together, as St Germans lips, which were nine miles asunder.


A sixth ARGUMENT.
That which is the badge and practise of wicked men may not be practised of the people of God; [they ust not con|forme theselves to the wicked of the world.] But to seek the destruction of humane learnig, is the badge and pra|ctie of wcke men I never read in any History, acred or Divine, of any but wcked men that ever did oppose it; Iulian the Apostate was one, he sought to destroy chools of learning, that with their downall, he might the bet|ter destro the Christian Faith.V. Nazianz. Orat. 3. Socrat. l. 3. c. .10. Fidel|bus prohebut tam Philosophiam libe|rales ares, lectionem Ehnicoum scrip|torum,

fieri non potest quin vehementer prosit quod Hostis prohibuit. Aretius.
Humanitatis studia ita ode|rat  contem|nebat, ut ejus studiosos uno nomine Haereti|cos appellaret, c. Platina in vit. Pauli 2. pag. 793.2. The next that I read of, was that wicked Pope Paul the second, who so hated humane learning, that he called al scholars Hereticks, or such as should but ame an University in jest or ear|nest, perswading the Romans not to bring up their children in learning, say|ing, that 'twas sufficient if they could but write and read: Sure Sam: How, Tom: Coller, and this Pope, were kins|men, they speak all one Dialect.
3. The last are the tumultuous Ana|baptists, Familists, Antinomians. and Liertines in Germany, they cried down humane learning, and burnt all books save the Bible c. but we know their end.


The seventh ARGUMENT.
If humane learning be needlesse, then the erection of Universities and Schools of Learning would be vain; [for to what end were it to set up Schools of Philo|sophy, Arts, Sciences, c. if none might learn the.]
But the erection of Universities and Schools of learning, is not vain: for wee

read in Scripture of Schools and Col|ledges, where the sonnes of the Pro|phets were trained up in learning, and studied the Law of God, that they might be fit to teach others.Hic erat caetu  collegium Prophetarum. Thus Sa|muel kept a School a Nioth in Ramah, 1 Sam. 19.19, 20. Elisha erects a School at Gilgal, and there like a Regens, docens dirigen, quasi dux  Magi|ster,  Lap. Hinc colligimus quasdam fuisse Prophetarum scholas, in qui|bus sormaren|tur, qui deinde ver am religio|nem docerent, purilat  do|ctrinae retine|rent, Calvin. Tutour or Master instructs those young men, cal|led the sonnes of the Prophets, 2 Kings 4.38. Wee read of another School at Bethel, 2 Kings 2.3. and another at Ie|richo, ver. 5. and another at Mount Ephram, 2 Kings 5.22. Paul was brought up at the feet of a learned Gamaliel, Acts 22 3. with  1.39. By him 'tis like he was informed in hu+mane learning, wherein he did excell s appears by his writings: And therefore all zealous Constantines have in their severall generations, been care|full to erect and incourage Schools and Nurseries of good literature and lear|ning, with all their might. True, the place can doe little if the spirit be wan|ting; [as Si desit SS. non adjuvat. lo|cus; idem enim Lt qi in So|domi sanctus extit, in mon|te peccavit, pri|mus nuster pa|reus, in Paradi|sa concidit,  si locus servare pouisset, Satan de clo non ce|cidisset, Greg. Gregory super Ezk 9 in another cae aies] but yet the spirit works by mean, and 'tis good to it in the winds way, we shall ail the sooner and the better for it.
Ob. There is no such expresse com|mand in scripture, for any such Schools of learning.
An. Yet there is that which is equi|valent to it, for we read of the Schools of the Prophets, and of a Colledge, 2 Kings 22.14 Huldah the Prophe|tesse dwel in the Quo loco d|batur opera eru|ditio  do|ctrinae; in eo e|nim habitabant prophitae  do+ctores,  Lap. Among the +ralites 48 Ci|ties wer ap+pointed or the Levites, which were as the common Schools and Universities for the hole Kingdom. Pu h Pilg. lib. 1. cap. 11. Colledge (i) in the place where the Prophets, and such as were children of the Prophets, had their usuall abode. [as the late learned Annota. well observe] We read also that the sonnes and pupils of the Pro|phets, had a peculiar place to dwell to|gether in, which upon their increase, was too little for them, and therefore they desire it may be enlarged, 2 Kin. 6.1.2, c. A School to teach children to write and read, is no where in expres tears commanded; yet Sam: How and Collier (as lack as he is) acknow|ledge tha children ought to be taught to wrie and read. He that would see al the objections made against Universi|ties more fully answered, let him perue that leaned, modest, elaborate Treatise o Mt lake, Vindiciae foederit. chap. 18.  Cavnus Schoas aperir  docto|res constitu necsse est: nam si haec ordi|naria

media neglexerimus,  librorum aliarm erum ad studia necessaria|rum curam abjecerimus, qubus erudi|antur  praeparentur futari olm divinae voluntatis testes,  qui ecclesiam aliqo ordine regant, horrenda san confusio|nem in eclesiam,  in nostra capita de|rivabimus.


The eighth ARGUMENT.
If the quilders of Babylon have been, and still are at great cost and charges to promote learning, that they may the better destroy the tuth, surely then the builders of Zion (who have farre better worke, and shall have better wages) ought to be more active this way; but the builders of Babylon have been, and still are at great cost and charges to promote learning, that they may the better destroy the truth; [hence they have set up eighteen Universities in Spain, eleven in Italy many in France, and shall England have none to oppose them?] Some have pictured the world with its feet upwards, to note unto us, that all things in it are turned upside|down; surely if Universities and Schools

of good learning, which our pious an|cestours have been at such cost to erect, should now be destroyed, this picture of the world would soon be ours and a flood-gate would be opened to all er|rors, heresies, blasphemies, profanenesse and barbarisme it selfe, as we see a|mongst the savage Indians. Hence this present Parliament acknowledge, that for the propagation of the Gospell in New England, Universities Schools and Nurseries of literature must be setled there, for instructing and civilizing them. See the Act for promoting the Gospell in New England.


The ninth ARGUMENT.
That which in it selfe considered, is an excellent gift of God, and is or|dained by him for excellent ends and uses, may in no wise be contemned by us:
But humane learning in it selfe considered, is an excellent gift of God, and is ordained by him for excellent ends and uses.
Ergo, it may in no wise be contem|ned by us.
The Major is cleare.S. How con|eseth that humane lear|ning in it sel is a good thing, and good in its proper place, for the repai|rng of that decy which came uon man for sinne. Nw i hu|mane learning be to good, then the more of it the better, there can be no xce of what is good in it selfe.
Prit philoso|phia ingenui|tatem, qu redduntur inge|nia libe|ralia, atque it paepara~tu ad muus vitae re|ct ob u~ae Alst. Non  sed persi notas naturales; persi|cit intellectu~ q parit cognitione~ De  Creatu|ratum, Alsted. The Minor I prove by its parts.
1. Humane learning is an excllent gift of God, farre surpassing all the rich|s and treasures of the world; those adorne but the outward an, this helps to enrich and enoble the soule, which is the better part; and therefore the holy Ghost commends the godly for their excellency in this particular, as we have seen in the second Argument.
2. God hath ordained it for excel|lent ends and uses: It's an excellent meanes to prepare us for the true Reli|gion, it helps to civilize us, and to mol|lifie the harshnesse, and mitigate the fiercenesse of our natures, it roots up barbarisme, beatlinesse, cruelty, c. on of their own could say,
Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes. Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros Ovid. it helpes to preserve humane societies in peace; its also a meanes to improve and perfect our naturall gifts and abi|lities. It fits us for noble atchievements, and excellent imployments, both in Church and State.



The tenth ARGUMENT.
That which han en commended to us by the unanimous consent of the Acent Fathers, and by the Church of God ever since in its uceeding gene|rations, ought not to be lightly rejected of us; but the soer and modest use of humane learning, hath been commen|ded to us by the Antient Fathers, and by the Church of God ever since in its succeeding generations, Ergo, it ought nor to be lightly rejected of us.
The Major no ober an will deny. The nor I prove. 1. See Austin de Doct Christiana l. 2. total. (and Epist. 13.) where he pleads for ramar, Rhetorick, Logick, c. 2.

Diluuntur Sophismata. CHAP. II.
_I Come now to answer al the Cavls and Ob|jections which Ana|baptists, Antino i|ans, Familists and Li|beines. c. have fiamed against hu|mane learning. When one had made a long Oation in the praise of Hercu|les, ne asked hi, Quis illum viuea|vit? who ever dipraised him? imply|ing that 'twas a needless thing to prase that which nne ever yet dispraised: but if any should ask me who ever dis|praised humane learning I think ther is no part of the Land but can tell him. Yet I wish there were not some that

have been trained up to learning, that do despise and dispraise it; if wisedome must be beaten,Oportet sapien|tiam ab insipi|entibus feriri, Diogen. let it be by her foes, not friends by fools, not wise men, by Bar|bary and not by Athens: what their great Bulwarks, and strong olds are, I come now to examine.
1. Ob, Their Achilles and chiefe Argument is, Colos. 2.8. Beware lest any man spoile you through Philoso|phy, and vaine deceit, after the traditi|ons of men, after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ; from hence they argue thus;
Whatsoever the Scripture condemns, that must not be practised:
But the Scripture condemns Philoso|phy, Ergo.
Ans. The Major must be limited thus, whatsoever the Scripture really and absolutely condemnes, that may not be practised by us; [for there be many things in Scripture, which are compara|tively and seemingly condemned, which yet are not absolutely condem|ned, nor unlawfull, as See more, Appendix, Rule 32 Hos. 6.6. Iohn 6.7, c. I will have mercy and not sacri|fice (1) comparatively mercy rather then sacrifice.] and then the Minor is false.

But all Philosophy is really and abso|lutely condemned in Scripture. For the Apostle doth not in this place condemn all Pilosophy, but only abusive Philo|sophy, such as spoiles and corrupts the soule with its delusions; and is Philosophia falsa  futlis, Philosophia noe est uisi  Came|rarius.
Sub philosophi|ae nomine tan|tum damnat omnes adulteri|na doctrinas quae nascuntur ex humano c|pie, qualemcun|que habeant |tionis colorem. Calvin in loe. falsely so called. The words are plain, beware lest any man spoile you [or make a prey of you, by causing you to err from the faith] through Philosophy: So then it is not all Philosophy, but spoiling Phi|losophy, vaine Philosophy, such as the false Apostles used; whom he compares to Theeves, who labour secretly and subtilly to make a prey of the flock, when they cannot doe it violently. [So much the Originall will beare . Qui depraedetur vos, verbum mili|tare, quod significat praedam eligere.] This will further appear.

1. From the Context.
2. By the Exegesis.
3. By the Apostles
practice.

1. From the Context, ver 4. Let no man beguile you with intising words. See, tis not simply and absolutely words, but beguiling entising words which the Apostle condemns:, qui als racinando fallit. So it is not simply

and absolutely Philosophy, but deceit|full beguiling Philosophy, which draw the heart away from Christ, and the simplicity of the Gospell. Non verum usum syncer Philosophiae, sed abusum, qui est confuio Philosophiae cm Evan|gelio, prohibet; vel potis sopsticen il|lam rejicit, quam falsi aliqui Philoso|phiae titulo venditant cum sit tantm inanis quaedam deceptio, Pzel. 2. By the Exegesis, the latter part of the verse (as it is usall in Scripture) doth ex|pound the former.Cavete  Philo|sophia quae ni|hil aliud est quam inanis de|ceptio. Calvin. Beware lest any man spoile you through Philosophy; but what Philosophy doth the Apostle mean? why he tels you, such as brings forth , vana ecptione. Vr Philoso|phia est partus rectae rationis,  aeerna veri|i . (1) vul| particula, Cem. Alex. Sirom. 1. vain deceit and is full of sophistry, and captious subtilty. Now not all Philoso|phy is such; for true Philosophy is the truth of God, and the fruit of right rea|son, Rom. 1.18.19. 'tis  ipsius, much of God may be seen in the nature of the Creatures, Acts. 14.17. 2. The Philosophy which Paul condemnes is such as is according to the Traditi|ons of men, not according to the mind of Christ, but such as is pleasing to flesh and blood 3. It is founded in the rudi|ments of the world, and withdraws

men from Christ; and then the best E|thicall Philosophy in lato, Aristotle, c. when it in is put the name of Christ, must be rejected.
3. The Apostles practice shews that he doth not condemn all Philoso|phy, for himselfe oft used it, in disputing Philosophically, with the Philosophers at Athens, and confounding thm out of their own writings. Acts 17.28 29. Rom. 1. and was well vered in humane Authors, as appears by his prompt quo|tations of them Now see what a Para|logism here is [fallacia  dicto secun|dum quid,Nque smplici|e damnatur ab Apostolo phi|losopia, sed  (1) quatenus sese intra fines sues non continet, nec ad gloriam Dei frtur, nec verbo Dei regi s sinit. Beza. ad dictum simplicite] because the Apostle condemnes spoiling Philo|sophy, vain Philosophy, beguiling, false, frivolous Philosophy, Ergo, he con|demns true Philosophy, which is a gift of God, and a great help to the knowledge of Divinity 'Tis plain, that the Apostle condemnes the abuse, and not the true use of Philosophy. Now if the abuse of a thing must take away the use of it; away then with the Sunne, which some Idolaters worshipped by day, and with the Mon, which they worshipped by night, and so were A|theists by day and night; yea away

them with bread, drink, cloaths, fire, air, water, c. for all these are abused by men,Fallacia Ari|dentis. Ergo, by this Anabaptisticall Lo|gick, they must be all cast away. We must therefore know, that when the Scripture or Fathers condemn Philo|sophy, 'tis the vanity, errors, figments, and abuse of Philosophy, which they speake against,Si Philosophiam damnare Apo|stolus, damnaet utique lumn rationis,  De|um ejus autho|rem summ of ceret injura. Davenant in Col. 2.8. ubi plu|ra. and not that knowledge of the truth found out by the light of naturall reason, whereby we come to know much of God, this being an ex|cellent gift of his, granted to man for his good, being no way repugnant, but subservient to Divinity. Ad rem  ap|posit Tilenus, [Syntag. P. 1. p. 59.] Quae aversus Philosophiam, vel Pulus, vel prijc Pares paul inclementis dixisse videntur, abusum ipsis, non ipsam, sed  qandm  insanentem sapientam, Philosophiae nomine  in.  dignam, perstringn. The  me of the Apostles words is this q. d. Have a speciall care, lest any false Teachers make a prey of you, and beguile you with their vain Philosophy and worldly wisedome, mixing Divine things with humane, and measuring heavenly m|steries by their naturall reason, drawing

you from the truth of Christ, and from the simplicity of the Gospell, to the tra|ditions of men, and beggarly rudiments of the world.

The second OBIECTION.
Rom. 1.21, 22. The Apostle con|demnes the Gentiles (say they) that had but meer naturall knowledge, be|cause they did not glorify God, but be|came unthankfull, vain in their imagi|nations, foolish and dark, c.
So 1 Cor. 1.20. The wisedome of this world (i) Philosophy (say they) is condemned as foolishness: From hence they argue thus;
That which breeds idle speculations, vaine deceits, aiery nothings, but fils men full of foolishnesse and darknesse, that must be avoided;
But Philosophy doth so, Ergo.
An. I answer to the Minor by di|stinguishing of Philosophy, which is two-fold. 1. Philosophia propri sic dicta, Philosophy truly so called, which is an excellent gift of God, and a part of divine wisedome,Res Dei ratio. Tertullian. whereby we come to know much both in Divine and

humane things, so farre as by the light of nature they may be known. This the Scripture never condemnes; but rather condemnes men for not walking up to such knowledge, and answerable to such light Rom. 1.
2. There is Philsohia , impropri  busiv sic dict, Phi|losoph falsey o called,Secuti sunt non veritatem cordibus im|pressam  in operibus Dei lucene, sed vanissi suos ,  disqsi  es. Pareus De mundanae sapienti vani|tate lequitur. Calvin. whn men fol|low the idle dreames vaine speculati|ons, and ar nothings of their owne braine, besides, and contrary to the word of God. This, and this alone is that which the Scripture so oft con|demnes, 'tis not true Philosophy, but vae Philosophy, not the right use, but the vain and foolish abuse of it, as ap|pears, Ephes. 4.14. and 5.6. 1 Cor 2 4. 1 im. 1 4. and 6.20. and 2.  16. Tit. 3.9 'Tis that Science falsely (not truly) so called, which exalts it el against Go. and coupts the simplicity of the Gospel which the holy Ghost in Scrip|ture o ot blames No  this is meere fallacius arguing ( former from Col. 8) to  the abuse of a thing  ll the true use of it; and would vehrow all things quikly. Ad rem  apposie Partus. Deus

Philosophiam per se non rejicit, quae alio|qui inter eximia Dei dona censetur; sed quia bs vera illa sapientia, quae in ag|nitione  timore Dei consisti mera est vanitas omnis humana prudentia  eru|ditio. Pareus.
The like answer serves for 1 Cor. 1.20. The Apostle there condemnes not the use, but another abuse of Philoso|phy, in that they set it above Divinity, when like a hand-maid, it should one|ly have waited on it.Qui vult sa|piens fieri in Aristotele, stuli ficetur in Christo, ut Catechismus re|gat Philoso|phiam, non re|gatur ab c Luther. This appeares from the circumstances in the Text, they preferred their own wisedome, and made it the Rule of their lives, contemning the Crosse of Christ, and its doctrine as foolishnesse, ver. 18 22, 23. they preferred their humane reason, and philosophicall conceits before the plaine preaching of Christ Crucified, which they accounted foolishnesse all that these Gentiles sought for, was wisedome, wisedome (1) a wisedome conormable to naturall reason, belee|ving no more in Religion, then they can see naturall reason for. This is that the Apostle blames them for, as Calvin well observes. Non simpliciter damnat postolus aut naturalem perspicaciam,

aut prudentia~ usu  experienti collecta~, aut cultum ingeui literis comparatum, sed hoc totum ad perspiciendam spiritua|lem sapientiam nullius esse momenti affir|mat.


The third OBIECTION,
The Ancient Fathers doe of con|demne Philosophers; Irenaeus confutes many of their vaine opinions; Irenaeus adversus Haereses, l. 2. c. 9. So Lactanti|us institut. l. 3. c. 2.Haereticorum Patriarchae Philosophi. Tertul. l. de a|nima c. . Plato nem omnium haereticorum condimentum vocat. Tertullian declaims against them very much, he cals Philo|sophers the Hereticks Patriarks, be|cause many of the Hereticks drew their errors out of their writings, as the Va|lentinians, Arrians, Marcionites. c.
Ans. They speak not against Philo|sophy, but against some vaine Philoso|phers, who abused Philosophy, to the maintaining of errors and Heresies. Now  persona ad rem non valet conse|quentia, because some men abuse wine, or a sword, it doth not therefore fol|low that wine is naught, or a sword evill; the fault is in the person, who abuseth the wine to Drunkennesse, and the sword to violence.
2. 'Tis one thing to reject the er|rors

and vanities of Philosophers,Errata artifi|cum non sunt imputanda ips arti, nec Philo|sophaumer|rres ipsi Philo|sophiae. and another thing to reject Philosophy it selfe; the Fathers condemned the one, but not the other. San  soli cla|ris. ille Theolog. Professor; Patres abu|sum, non usum legitimum rationis exagi|tant, nec de vera Philosophia, sed perpe|ram Philosphantium fucis, frauae, sub|tiliate, aut ignorantia, eorum dicta sunt intelligenda, c. Dr rideaux. Lect. 14. S. 14 page 227. ubi plura.


The fourth OBIECTION.
The Saints are all taught of God, they have the inward teaching of the spirit, which is sufficient in it selfe (aith Sam: How) Ergo, they need no out|ward teaching by men brought up in humane learning
An. Subordinata non pugnant. The outward teaching is subordinate, but not opposite to the inward; nor doth Gods inward teachng by his spirit, any way exclude, but rather include the out|ward teaching; for whom God tea|cheth now, he teacheth not immedi|ately a formerly, but mediately, by meanes; and therefore he that promised

to teach them by his spirit, promised also to give them Prophets, Pastors, Teachers, accomplisht with all needfull abilities for the better edifying of his Church, Eph. 4.11, 12.
2. I answer,  Pari: if humane lear|ning be needlesse because the spirits teaching is sufficient, then by the same Argument, naturall reason should bee needlesse; for such as condemne Arts, may as well condemne Reason, for what are Arts, but Reason brought in|to rule and order?


The fifth OBIECTION.
Paul counted all but Dung for Christ [Phil. 3.7, 8.]
But his humane learning was a part of this All; [for he was a Pharisee, and they excelled in knowledge, and were the chiefe teachers of it in Christs time.]
Ergo, he counted it but dung for Christ.
 (i) res omnes, elo|quentiam, opes, delicias, gloria~, c pro. Christo damna, im sterra existi|mo.  Lap.Ans. This is a Dunghill-Argument, and is easily answered by limiting the Major; Paul counted all but dung for Christ comparatively, not simply; and so when Riches, Pleasures, Honours,

c. come in competition with Christ, they must be esteemed in comparison of him, as drosse and dung: if a man have riches, he must not cast them away, but he must cast away his confidence in them; so if he have learning, and skill in Arts, he must not cast it away, (for in it selfe it is a good gift of God, Exod. 31.2, 3, 4, 5.) but he must cast away his pride nd glorying in it,Spoliavit se Paulus non opi|bus. sed perver|s fiduci pe|rum. Calvin. he must glory in none but Christ; thus Paul cared not to know any thing in comparison of the excellent knowledge of Christ Crucified,In oratione pri|ma. 1 Cor. 2.2. Thus Nazianzen, a very learned man, accomplisht with much Athenian Eloquence, rejoiced that he had any thing of worth, to esteem as nothing in comparison of Christ.


The sixth OBIECTION.
From Rom. 8.7. The wisedome of the flesh is enmity against God, and 2 Cor. 10.4. The weapons of our warfare are not carnall.
Ans. Learning sanctified is no car|nall thing, but the good gift of God, and so is not enmity to God, but pleasing

to him; nor doth the Apostle by the wisedome of the flesh mean Philoso|phy, but the corruption and depravati|on of our natures; and therefore he doth not simply condemne wisedome, but fleshly wisedome, such as proceeds from the pravity of the flesh, and makes us rebell against God.
2. Though Logick Philosophy, Rhe|torick c in themseves considered are not able to convert a soule, et being spiritualliz'd and improved to the right opening and expounding of the Scrip|ture they may be a meanes the better to convince our judgements, and work upon our affections, and so help forward our conversion. Plowing, Sowing, and breaking the clods c. of it selfe cannot make the corn to grow, yet 'tis a meanes which God hath or|dained for that end, and we must use it if we expect his blessing.


The seventh OBIECTION.
1 Cor 1.17. Paul would not preach the Gospell with the wisedome of words, Ergo. we may not do it.
Ans. It is one thing to preach in

the wisedome of mans words,Taxat Pseuda postolos quod rhetoricati sint in Christo prae|dicando negle|ct  Evangelii simplicitate. Musculus. and ano|ther thing to make use of learning in our preparations for preaching. The Apostle therefore doth not simply con|demne learning, eloquence, freedome of speech, c. (which in themselves are the good gift of God) for Paul used much of it himselfe, and was able to speak more tongues then they all; but that which he condemnes is vaine, affected straines of eloquence, and pom|pous words, whereby the simplicity of the Gospell was corrupted,Eloquentia ipsa non est culpabi|lis, sed e mal utentium per|versitas. Aug. and souls kept thereby from Christ: Now this is the abuse and not the right use of lear|ning, which Paul condemnes. The Scripture it selfe is full of Divine elo|quence  Rhetorick See more fully, Mr Per|kins on Heb. 11.12. p. 93. Qui dedit Pe|trum piscato|rem, dedit  Cyprianum rhetorem. Aug. and it may law|fully be used by a Minister of the Gos|pell, not for ostentation, but edification, for being sanctified, it is a furtherance and not a hinderance to the hearers. Non laudatur ruditas, sed simplicitas; nec vituperatur eruditio, sed oftentatio; improbat Apostolus non omnem, sed af|fectatam eloquentiam,  mixturam sa|pientiae humanae cum doctrin Evangelii, ut qum scitissim acutissimus Pareus in locum.



The eighth OBIECTION.
Philosophy is contrary to Divinity now contraries (saies Sam: How) must not be put together, but the Gospell and humane learning are contraries, Ergo.
Verum vero contrariari non potest, a vera philosophia est veritas Dei, Roma. 18. Deus non est sibi contrarius in lumine natu|rae  gratiae. Philosophia sa|na non pugnat cum Theologia, sed ipsi ancilla|tur. Alsted.Ans. Nogatur Minor. Philosophy and humane learning is not contrary, but subservient; not opposite, but subordinate to the Gospell. [raetionem supponit, non opponit, instruit non destruit sacra Theologia] Hence the Lord oft commands us to make use of our Reason to judge examine, try al things, that we may discerne truth from fal|shood, and light from darknesse, Eph. 5.9. and 4.14. 1 Cor. 14.20. See this more fully handled in the first caution fol|lowing, c.


The ninth OBIECTION.
Christ was destitute of humane lear|ning, (saith How the Cobler) yea it is blasphemy (saith he) to affirm he had humane learning; since the Jews ad|miring, said, how knoweth this man

letters or learning, having never lear|ned, Iohn 7.15. Its therefore enough (saith How) for the Disciple to be as his Lord, he being destitute of humane learning, his Disciples may well be without it also, as it appeares they were, Acts 4.13.
Ans. Here's a Coblers End indeed, had it appeared at another season, it might have had a fire instead of an An|swer. 1. Then I utterly deny that Christ had no humane learning;Christ and his Apostles made use of tongues and Logick for opening of the Scripture, some times they make use of the Hebrew Text, and translate it in|to Greek, and sometimes they draw lo|gicall conse|quences from the Old Test. to prove the principles of the New, as Exod. 3.6. com|pared with Ma. 22.32. for Isaiah 11.2, 3. and 50.4. tels us expresly, that he had the tongue of the learned given him, and that the spirit of wise|dome understanding, counsell, might and knowledge should rest upon him, and make him quick of understanding, and therefore there are said to be hid in him treasures of wisedome and know|ledge, Col. 2.3. Now, how he came by it, whether by infusion from Heaven, or the personall union, or education at Schools, it's not materiall since it's ap|parent by Scripture, that he was full of wisedome; insomuch, as the Pharisees wondred that Christ a Carpenters son, never taught at Schools and Universi|ties, should be able to speak so learned|ly,

promptly and fully: now had they not been grosly blinded by unbeliefe, they might easily have seen, that since Christ had not his learning by ordinary and usuall meanes, therefore he had it extraordinarily, and immediately from God, and so have acknowledged the evi|dence of Gods spirit therein.
2. 'Tis true, the Apostles were un|learned in respect of education.Indoctos elegit Christus sed o|culavit in pru|dentes; siml dona dedit  ministeriae. they were never brought up at Univesities, but in respect of inspiration they were not unlearned; for Christ made them learned, and fitted them before he sent them; (as I have proved at large in an|other Treatise) insomuch as the Scribes wondred at their boldnesse and abilities,Pulpit Guar|ded, Ob. 3. p. 53 Acts 4.13. and how, they be|ing unlearned, should come by such learning. In a word, they were , illiterate men, or men without let|ters, not simply, (for they had spent some time in studying the Scriptures,  were al , taught of God, Ioh. 45. and 14.26 1 Thes. 4.9. 2 Pet. 1.21.) but , in the Pharisees esteem they were unlearned, (who conceited that the empire of learning was within their own dominion)

2. Because they were not brought up in ordinary Schools of learning, though they were brought up in the School of Christ, which was incomparably bet|ter. The learning is still the same,Nunc cum con|firmatum habe|amus Evange|lium  ecclesi|a const tutam expectare ulte|ris Enthusias|mos, neglectis  mediis, vertigi|nosi est cerebelli ad Anticyras potis qum ad Aegypttos rele|gandi. D. Prid. conci. 1. onely the way of attaining it, is diffe|rent now from what it was in the Pri|mitive times; Christ, the Prophets and Apostles had it by supernaturall and immediate revelation and infusion, we now by Reading, Teaching, Education, Study, and Pains, in Schools and Uni|versities.


The tenth OBIECTION.
But there are many errors amongst Philosophers, Poets, Heathens, c. what shall we doe in such a case?
Ans. The Apostle tels you, 1 Thes. 5.21. Try all things, and what upon try all you find to be sound and good, hold that fast. We must therefore read with judgement, and not like children, swallow all that's put into our mouths; and this brings me to the cautions, which are ten.




CHAP. III. Ten Cautions.
_FIrst, Beware of the two extreams, set not Phi|losophy, and Arts too high, nor yet too low; Medio tutissimus ibis. The Anabaptists of|fend in the Defect, and totally cry down all humane lear|ning. Others offend in the Excesse, pre|ferring it before Divinity; they set Hagar the servant in the chaire, and make Dame Sarah wait. This is to abuse it, and not to use it: then a thing is abused, when it is not used in that manner, and for that end to which God hath ordained it; when we set it high|er

then God would have us, Idolizing it, resting in it. Philosophy is ordained by God to be an help and furtherance in the study of Divinity; now when men make it an hinderance to the pre|judice of the Scripture, hurt of the hea|rers, vain-glory in the Teachers, c. This is to abuse,Philosophia tanquam famu|la sit Theologiae subdita; ancille|tur, non Domi|netur. not use Philosophy; which ought alwaies to be subservient, but never superiour to Divinity; and therefore when Hagar begins thus to uurp over her Mistris, it's time to cast her out till shee submit her selfe. Philo|sophy is a good servant, but an ill Mi|stris to Divinity, and therefore Luther wittily compares it to the Asse on which Christ rode, which must be sub|ject, not superiour to Christ and his Gospell. It is the folly of many young wits, that they prefer Aristotle before Paul, and are so wedded to the opinion of the one that they scarce ever affect the truth taught by the other, in sinceri|ty: these like Penelopes suitors, leave the Mistris, and fall in love with the maids. Heare what the learned  Lapide saith in this case; Lap. com. in Gen. p. 5. Ancillantur Theologiae quasi Dominae  Reginae omnes liberales dis|ciplinae, omnes scientiae atque artes, quae

certis singulae terminis continentur. Sa|cra autem haec scientia ambit omnia, complectitur universa, omniumque usum suo jure sibi assumit; ut proide quasi omnium perfectssima, omnium finis  scopus, ultimo loco veniat addiscenda. Cui suffragatur claris. Walaeus. Artes  scientiae ancillentur veritati Theologicae,Orat. 1. p. 303. non praesint; leges ab ea accipiant, nullas praescribant. mpum est humana inventa caelest veritati praeferre aut divina my|steria angustis humant ingenii mensuris circumscribere; ex hoc vitio pleraeque haereses ortae sunt, c. Sane  sci ic Aquinas. Theologia accipere potest ali|quid  Philosophicis disciplinis, non quod ex necessitate is indigeat, sed ad majo|rem manifestationem eorum, quae in hac scientia traduntur Non enim accipit sua principia ab aliis scientiis, sed immediat  De per revelationem,  ideo non ac|cipi a aliis scientiis tanquam  uperi|oribus, sed ut ur eis tanquam inferio|ribus  ancillis,Aquinas 1 par. Q. 1. Art. ,5. ubi plura Ex Philosopho|rum ingeniis omnis haeresis onimatur. Tertullian. c.
The second Caution; Beware of mixing and confounding Philosophy with Divinity; this hath brought many Heresies into the Church. This was the fault of the false Apostles, whom Paul

blames, for mixing the works of the Law with Faith, and bringing Philo|sophicall Tenents into Divinity, and in this kind the School-men were gross|ly guilty,Hipotis su|perstitionibus  subtilitati|bus litant, qum texts simplici|tati. Aling. Nihil odiosius nimio acumine. who made Divinity stoop to Philosopy, and went about to prove its deepest supernaturall mysteries, by na|turall reason out of Aristotle, and so are become a Dunghill of errors; and are compared by some, to one having bread and good wine hanging on both sides them, yet himselfe hungrily gnawing a flint stone.V Bowles Pa|stor Evangel. l. 1. c. 19. p. 125. [Theologiam in mataeologiam converterunt, eorum doctrina Philosophi|ca magis fuit qu Theologica, quique magis ratiunculis humanis qum testi|moniis divinis nituntur  disputant] Wee must not bring down the myste|ries of Religion to be scanned by Phi|losophy, but we must make Philosophy wait and submit to Divinity.Deceptoria est Philosophia cum sertur ex|tra proprios li|mites (i) cum|statuere conatur de illis rebus quae non possunt dijudicari, c. Divenant in Col. 2.8. ubi plu|ra. Every Science must keep its proper bounds, for many things which are true in Phi|losophy, yet are not so when applied to Divinity;   contra. e. g. Ex nihilo nihil fit, of nothing, nothing is made, this is true in Philosophy, yet in Divi|nity wee know that God created all things of nothing. So, A privatione ad

haebitum non datur regressus. This is true in Philosophy, and according to the course of nature; but not in Divinity, since God by his omnipotency works above nature, and can raise the dead. So the righteousnesse by which a man is just and righteous, is inherent in him|selfe, and not in another. So, Virgo non est mater, nec homo Deus. Philosophic haec sunt vera, non Theologic; Physic, non hyperphysic. Abusus itaque est cum rerum physicarum propria transferuntur ad res hyperphysicas. Intra terminos o|portet , nec lict temer canta|re canticum Domini in terra aliena, ne fiat . (i) transi|tus in aliud genus.
3. Beware of abusing these particu|lar Arts and Sciences. 1. Grammar God hath ordained it as a means to ex|plain phrases and termes in Scripture: now when men play upon the words, and look more at them, then at the mat|ter, this is an abuse of the Art: so when men fall to Logomachies, and conten|ding about words, which Paul con|demned, 1 Tim. 6.4. and 2.2, 14.
2. Rhetorick is, aused when men coin figures, and change the literall into

an Allegoricall sense, as Origen did, this is a corrupting of this god Art, and is condemned, Col. 2 4.
3. It's an abuse of Logick, when by Sophistry and false reasoning, we labour to draw men into errors. Dialecti|ca ad omnia pexetranda  dissolvenda plurimm valet; tantm cavenda est libido rixandi,  puerilis quaedam osten|tatio decipiendi adversarium. August. de Doct. Christiana. lib. 2. cap. 31, 32, 33, 34.
4. It's an abuse of Mathematicks,See more ful|ly Mr Gree against judici|all Astrology. And Mr Wa|terhouse in that excellent Treatise of his in Defence of humane lear|ning, p. 30, 31. (which includes Arithmeticke, Astro|nomy, and Geometry) when men take upon them to cast a Figure, or from the Stars, to calculate mens nativities, or to foretell the states of Kingdomes and Commonwealths; a sinne which Gods word oft condemnes, and therefore rancks Astrologers with Sorcerers, to whom they are neer allied, Isaiah 47.11, 12, 13, 14
5. It's an abuse of Physicks, when we pore so much on the Creatures, that we forget their Creator, and look so much after second causes, that wee forget the first.
6. It's an abuse of Metaphysicks,

when men labour by dark termes,Metaphysica in utrmque par|tem disputat omnia, vix quicquam certi habet, distincti|unculs fvolis  ineptis om|nia elidit  eladit, mer omnis sophisti|ca  decptio|nis. Alingius. im|proper phrases, idle questions, and vaine subtleties, to corrupt the truth, draw men to Atheisme, and make them meer Scepticks in Religion. Sic Scholastici Doctores in Papau Metaphysicis ter|minis res Theologicas contaminrunt, Pareus in Col. 28. ubi plura. Wee must therefore bring humane learning home to Divinity, to be pruned and pared with spiriuall wisedme, and then it may lawfully and profitably be used; as the Israelites might not marry with a Micianite whom they had taken in Warre,Termini Philo|sohici i rebus Theologicis ap|plicandi, ante|qua~ , ab omni imper|fectione liberen|tur. Dithmar. till shee was purified. (i) they must shave her head, pare her nailes, and put off the Garment shee was ta|ken in, and then they might marry with her, Numb. 31.18, 9. and Deut. 21.1, 12, 13.
4. Beware of Pride in humane lear|ning, let it not so puffe you up, that you cannot submit to the simplicity of the Gospell, 1 Cor. 8.1. for as learning is the ornament of the minde, so humility is the ornament of learning: many in|sult over their brethren, and contemne the people of God that want these qua|lifications, like the Pharisees, Ioh. 7.48,

49 Whereas the having of toe should make us more humble, considering the great account such have to make, for according to mens gifts, helps and ta|lents, must their account be; they that have received great abilities, and have either idlely buried them, or basely abu|sed them by drawing ignorant persons into error of life or doctrine, such shall receive the greater condemnation.
5. We may not stuffe our Sermons with Philosophy, though we may use it in our preparations, yet we must spa|ringly mention it in publick.Peccatur  mu|tis quod concio|nes populares mags exornen potarum versi|bus qum Scripturae testi|moniis. Areti. The lesse co|lour is in the glasse, the lighter and better it is. Pulchr per|versa doctrina paleae compara|tur quae medul|lam non habet, nec potest cre|dentes nutrire. Hieron. Artis est celare artem. 'Tis not Aristotle, Tully, Horace, c. but the holy Scripture that can convince te iudgement, and make it yield: we must therefore do by our humane learning, as Abraham did by his Asse and his servant. Gen. 22.5. it may go with us, to the foot of the hill, but not ascend into the Sanctuary. God will have no plowing with an Ox and an Ass, Deut. 22.9. but if any man speak, it must be with that feare and reve|rence, with that preparation and dis|cretion, as becomes the Oracles of od, 1 Pe. 4.11. for what is the chaffe to the wheat saith the Lord? Ier. 3.28. Quid

facit cum Psalterio Horatius? cum Evan|gelio Maro? cum Apostolis Cicero? nonne scandalizatur frater si te viderit in idolioracumbentem? Hieron. Eusta|chio. Vaine Rhetoricall,Tropos ignaris traere non de|cet, ne artem Grammaticae docere ida|mur. Aug. Philosophicall florishes doe savour of ostentation, wast the time which might be better spent, and hinders the Edification of the hearers; for as in all things, so especial|ly in Preaching, all things should be done to edifying, and therefore 'tis ob|served that Gods servants, Moses, Christ Paul c. though they were singularly learned, and well accomplisht with all kind of learning, yet they concealed it, and seldome or never shewed it in their publick preaching, but came with holy simplicity, and in the demonstration of the spirit; and thus in our age did holy Perkins, Greenham, Baine, Bfield, Sibs, Preston, c. Minim probi illorum af|fectatam vanitatem, qui undique corr|gatis sententiolis infarciunt suas concio|nes, scripurarum interim prorsus imme|mores, c. ut apposit acutissimus Dave|nant in Col. 2.8. v. plura Ames. CC. lib. 4. cap. 26. Q. 6.  Zep. de arte concion. l. 2. c. 6.
6. Spend not too much time in them,

rest not here; many study Heathens so long, till they become almost heathe|nish, like the man that studied School-Divinity so long, that at last he had for|got the Lords Prayer. Many of Origens errors, came from an over-wening love of Philosophy. In Philosophiae indagatione |mum tempois ne insumatur, nec speculatio|nibus umalibus aetas quae seis impendi debt, teatur. Walae. , Hippocrat. Omne nimium vertisur in vitium. I have known some in my time in the University, that doted so long on Philosophy, that they proved errant drones, and could never relish Divinity: what we say of a meer Lo|gician, is also true of a meer Philoso|pher, Merus Philosophus, merus Asinus. These studies are but the elements and preparations onely to Divinity,Rudimenta sunt non opera. Sen. they are but the way, not our mark and chiefe end, and therefore our learning of these Sciences (as Austin well observes) must be modesta  succincta, else it may prove vinum inebrians, implens non nu|triens, inflas non aedficans, saith Ber|nard. These prepare the wit for higher studies,Praparent in|genium, non de|tineant. Sen. but we must not rest here. Nam si exotica illa cum Scripturae thesauris comparentur; nihil nisi , nugae erunt  quisquiliae, Tilenus. Has itaqu disciplinas, paucis  velut ad majora

utiliorque properan percurre. Hyperi|us de rat. stud. Theolog. l. 1. c. 7. p. 6. ubi plura.
7. I speak not this to discourage any young beginners, (as if I would have none to be Ministers but such as can read a Lecture in Philosophy) who strive and studie for competent abili|ties, in Arts and Languages, nor any who have reall abilities, and shall be judged sit by a Presbytery, and so called to the Ministery,Philosophia Theologo est necessria non  sed , non quoad , sed , (i) non quoad notitiam simpli cem  absolu|tam, sd quoad noitiam plenio|rem  solidio|rem. Dithma. though for the present they be defective this way: for humane learning doth not impower, but fits us to preach; it doth not make us Mini|sters, but it maketh us able Ministers of the Gospell: it's necessary, not simply ad esse, to the being, but ad bne esse to the well being of a Preacher: 'tis re|quisite necessitate expedientiae   non necessitate absolut, as if a man could know nothing in Divinity with|out it. he wan of it is a blemish and defect, which by all good meanes we should labour to remove; for though a man may be a Preacher and a Dispu|tant without it, yet he shall never be so compleat a Preacher, not dexterous a Disputant, as he that hath it: and there|fore

I would advise all such, (I have known some that having strong natu|rall part, in a short time have gained good insight in the Arts and Langua|ges) though they cannot attaine that perfection which others have, yet to get such a competent measure of knowledge herein, as to be able to help themselves, and to see with their own eyes, and when doubts arise, not to be quite to seek, else the profane of the world will soon dicover their weaknesse, and they shall be sure to hear of it to their sorrow, unlesse they be very humble, gratious, and wise to prevent it c. v. plura apud Claris. Hyperium. l. 1 c. 7. p 60.
8 Get your learning sanctifyed; a learned head and an unsanctified heart is a fit instrument for the Devill to doe much mischiefe withall: such oft prove the oest enemies to Religion; who more learned then the Egyptians, yet who more gross Idolateis, and greater enemies to Gods people? Who more learned then the Scribes and Pharisees, yet who more gracelesse in their lives  Paul meets with most opposition at Athens, amongst the learned Philoso|phers,

Acts 17. So true is the Proverb, the learnedst Clerks, are not alwaies the wisest men, they are like an Asse deck with costly ornaments.Literatus stul|tus, phaleratus Asinus. All the humane learning in the world cannot bring a man to salvation, it may help to curb corruption civilize a man, and prepare him for better things, but 'tis the saving knowledge of the word, which giveth more grace, Iames 4 6. there onely true comfort is to be found; hence it's called by way of exclusion, The word of life, and the word of comfort, excluding all true comfort from any other word or writings,Esi illa natu|ralis cognitio u|sum suum insig|nem habet, sine Theologiae ta|men supervent salutaris esse non potest. Qumtum erg corpus aniae, terrena coelesti|hs, externa  fragili aeni  spiitualibus edunt; tantm caeterae omnes scientiae hu cdere libeer debent. Wal. which hath made the Godly to preferre it before all the treasures in the world. Wee should therefore mo|derate our delight in other studies, and make them all subservient to this; for this is not the end of our lives to get humane learning nor must it be prefer|red, much leste be equallized to the knowledge of God in his word, but al|waies kept in subordination to it; else what will it profit us to be good Gram|marians, and have skill in tongues, to have our hes full of knowledge, and our hearts empty of all goodnesse; or to be good Logicians, and kiull in an|swering

fallacies, yet suffer the Devill to delude us with his sophistry, or to be good Historians, and know what's done abroad, yet be ignorant of the state of our soules at home, c. Consider that humane learning is but a common gift of the spirit, which is oft bestowed on Reprobates and Heathens, as well as on Gods people; and therefore the Lord in his wisedome oft passeth by the learned, proud, selfe-conceited Rabbies of the time, and chuseth the poor, the simple, and meek of the earth, to set forth his praise, 1 Cor. 1.26, 27.
9. Yet beware of offending in the defect:Maneat usus, tollatur abusus. Let not the abuse of any thing, take away the lawfull and sober use of it. God would have us to use all helps, (for now we have nothing by Inspira|tion, Revelation, or any such extraordi|nary way, but all by study, paines and industry) he would have us make use of our Reading and Reaon, and not be like Horse and Mule, which have no understanding, Psal. 32.9. nor like chil|dren tossed to and fro with the delusi|ons of men.

Away then with those Fanaticks, Enthusiasts, Anabaptists c. who boast of the spirit, and of their revelations (the common , and refuge, when they are at a stand for Scripture to prove their errors, then they fly to Revelations, as the Papists when non|plust, fly to traditions) and under this pretence, they cry down Languages, Arts, Sciences, Universities, c. But let their pretences be never so specious, they are but back friends to Religion, that decry humane learning. Iulians Edict forbidding Christians the use of Schools, and exercises of Learning, was esteemed a more dangerous en|gine to overthrow the Christian Faith, then all the bloody persecutions of his predecessors, c.

Certainly much respect is to be given to the learning  godliness of men. There is a great delusion in many mens hearts, that makes them think it to be halfe Po|pery, to give any respect to learning; al|though the abuse of learning hath done much evil, against that much hath bin  may be said: but I dare avow this, that never since the beginning of the world could a man be found to speak against learning, but an ignorant an; neither

is it like; nay I may aver it it is impossi|ble, that any but such will be found to the end of the world; learning hath so much of God in it, that it never had, nor will have any enemy but ignorance, c.

Sam: How the Preaching Cobler, or the Cobling Preachers Epi|taph, by R. O.
WHat How? how now: hath How such learning found,
To shrow Arts curious Image to the grou~d?
Cambridge and Oxford may their glory now,
Vaile to a Cobler, if they knew but How:
Though big with Arts, they cannot overtop,
The Spirits Teaching in a Coblers shop.
Reader, if thou an humane Artist be,
Let humane learning be no judge for thee:
Lay down thy Arts, then try this Coblers End,
And see, if it be by the Spirit penn'd.
Meane time adue, yee Arts and Aists all,
The Spirits teaching may attend the Aull;
And thou brave Cobler blow another blast
Upon their learning, though thou blow thy Last.
R. O.



An Answer to R. O. his Verses made in commendation of a Book of Sa|muell How, a Cobler.
WHo's this, R. O. a Psychopannychist,
Rather the lae Pamphleting Mortalist?
If it be He, no wonder that he so
Admire the Cobler and even kisse his Toe;
And nothing make o' ' Vniversity,
Compared with his Awll-sufficency.
'Tis just with God, ha he that vilifies
The glorious Sunne should lowwormes Idolize;
And he that smels no sweetnesse in a Rose,
Should judge a Dunghill fittest for the nose,
And he that Mortall mas the Soule should call
This Samuell Hw, Doctor Angelicall,
Yea think this Saull Prophesies as well,
As ever did the Prophet Samuel.
Indeed for Mortall Soules he is as fit
As lasts can be for shoes or shoes for feet:
And fitter then the noble  Muses Sonns,
All whose brave blood, a course Immortall runnes;
Except this one degenerate, R. O.
Who may unto his learned Cobler goe,
Ad to his cure with his old shoes commend
His decad Soule, since Sam: can both amend.
Doubtlesse he will doe thus; and perhaps too,
He will at last be taught to patch a shooe;
And to his end profss  Cobler be,
Imagining some rare Dvinity
Lies in that Art, whee men have every houre,
Fresh charge of soles, and over them such power.
I wish he may wax wiser. But if he,
For Sam: How's sake, will needs a Cobler be,
Let him be one in grain Sam: hath set forth
A kocking pce of woke, of lasting worth;
Which ought to be dispesed by Transltions,
For Englands honour and the good of Nations.
Tis let R. O. Latinise: then all
May him Translatour f Translatours call.
D. Hallophilus.











On Samuell How the Cobler, lately turned Preacher, c.
WHo is sufficient for the Mnistry?
Cri'd once the Gentiles Doctor. That am I,
Thinks every Tradesman in these dregs of Time.
Even How the Cobler dares the Pulpit climb.
Belike he thinkes the difference is but small
Between the sword o'th' Spirit and the Awle.
And that he can as dexterously divide
The word of truth, as he can cut an Hide:
And that the soules of people cannot choose,
But be as tractable as the soles of Shooes.
In time perhaps he may his error see,
And say, none e'r was more deceiv'd then He.
The faults of shooes he doth no sooner spy,
But he knows how to cure them presently.
The faults of men he may his spirits spend
Upon, and irritate, but not amend.
'Tis not so easie in the Ministry,
To set men Upright that doe tread awry,
As in the Gentle Craft. The holyest Hearts
Ioin'd with the greatest prudence, paines and parts,
Have, oft complain'd that they could doe no good,
On this and that and th' other peece of wood.
Our shooes are soon prevailed with, to quit
Their ancient soles, and new ones to admit.
Men will not be so soon perswaded to
Put off the old Man, and put on the New.
But we may feare, that How and such as Hee,
Mechanicks, that invade the Ministry,
Have no such end as sinners to convert,
But (O mischievous madnesse) to pervert
Such as are converts, or are comming on
In a faire way toward Conversion.
They presse not the New Man, but such New Wayes,
As lead men from the Ancient of Dayes.
Whether we New Creatures be or not, wee see
They doe not care, so we their Creatures be.
Against our Reverend Clergy they inveigh,
Because it is a Mountain in their way.
Could they remove that once, all would be theirs;
The Fathers outed they should be brave Heires.
Iust sch as Absolom, had he overthrown
His Father David, and pssss'd his Thrne.
The lberall Arts they likewise doe decry,
Those needfull Hand-mads to Divinity.
This high bon Lady, they would leave as bare
As new shorne Sheep, or naked Indians are.
The Spirit they say sufficient is They might
Say too, the Mon affords sufficient light,
Without this Train of Starres; ye Starres be gone;
Wee'll be contented with the Moon alone.
But against learning would they blaterate,
Unlesse themselves were so illiterate?
The Ape much fault with Foxes tayle doth find,
Because himselfe can nothing shew behind.
The Fox those Grapes doth greatly vilifie,
Though ne'r so pretious that doe hang too high.
Could tailes he had, they'd well enough please Apes;
And Foxes could they reach them would praise grapes.
These Animals too, had they the Arts they want,
They would them prize, and scorn the ignorant.
To strike all dead, those Pillars of our Land,
Jachin and Boaz may no longer stand
Tabor and Hermon, mountaines that maintain
The gowned Nation they would make a Plain.
What need, say they, o'th' two fold Athens now,
Or Mothers Breasts, when we past children grow?
Our Land can now well spare those two great Eyes.
Yes, so it can, if it will Heathenize.
I'm sure it may well spare such Mouths. If God
Permit them long, we may cry Ichabod.
For such wild Preachers, whatsoe'r they say,
Will Preach true Preaching, and even Christ away.
Th. Elshmor.

To the Candid and Cour|teous Reader.
Reader,
_WHen I had perused the Theologicall Rules of Mr Wilson, which came but lately to my hands by reason of their scarcity, they being Printed 1615. I conceived it might be an acceptable service to the Publick, to Reprint them with some additionall Rules;Ignorantia scripturarum peperit haereses. Chrysost. especially now, when errours abound so much through ignorance of such Rules. But when I perceived by the Printers, that the Presse at this time (when Trading is so dead) would not beare the volume, I was constrai|ned to take another course, and to set forth my owne Rules single by them|selves; yet have I given the succum  sanguinem, the Mar|row

These Rules I have been gathering many years for my owne private use; here thou hast them enlarged with referen|ces (for brevities sake) to such as han|dle any Rule more fully.

Rules to be observed for the right Interpreta|tion of Scripture.
_FIrst, They that would understand the mea|ning of Gods spirit, must be men of spiri|tuall minds,Sit mens nostra terren faece perpurgata, pas|sionum discussis nebuli, sancta  sublimis e|ecta, ut apta habilis redda|tur ad coelesia haec dogmata barida.  Lap. Deus amicis su|is arcana animi sui communicat. Iohn 15.15. 1 Cor. 2.15. the spirituall man (i) the regenerate man judgeth all things (i) he is not on|ly certaine of the truth which himselfe holds, but he can also judge and clear|ly discerne the errors that are held by others. They have received an Uncti|on from the holy one (1) they have the holy spirit of God, and this benefit they have by him, that they know all things, [1 Ioh 2, 26, 27.] not simply all

things that are knowable, but all things that are necessary to salvation; and herein the poorest Idiot (being a sound Christian) goeth beyond the profoun|dest Clerks that are not sanctified; for he hath his own heart instead of a Commentary, o help him in the under|standing of the most needfull points in Scripture. He then that would inter|pret Scripture,Sine pur mn|te  Sancto|rum imitation, nemo compre|enderit San|ctorum verba. Athanas. Dus se puris videndum prae|bet in verb suo in ac vita,  visione glorios n sutur Mat 5 8. Rive. Nunquam Pau|li senum ingre|duris, nisi Pau|li spiritum im|ibris. Be. must come with a Scrip|ture-frame of Spirit; he must have a holy and heavenly heart, sutable to the holinesse and Heavenlinesse that is in the word. The Scriptures spiritual|nesse, cals for a heart filled with Scrip|ture spiritualnesse, to set forth its excel|lencies: for as no man can rightly sing Davids Psalmes, without Davids spi|rit; so no man can rightly expound the Word of God without the spirit of God. Carnall, sensuall hearts, and such divine, spirituall work, will never agree. A vessell that's full of poyson, cannot receive pure waer; or if it could, yet the Vessell would aint it.
Sincerum est nisi vas, quodcunque in|sundis acessi. Hor.
'Tis the nature of the Word to be facile and comfortable to such as are

of a semblable disposition to it, [Micah 2.7.] but dark,Luce Scriptu|ra, sed fiis lu|cis. Tilen. Pium  pru|dentem requi|rit lectorem. harsh, and hard to the wicked, unregenerate, unmortified men. Sin in the affection, will quickly breed error and darknesse in the understan|ding; Pride, Covetousnesse, c. blind the judgement, Iohn 5.44. Luke 16.14. We must be renewed in the spirit of our minds, before ever we can prove what is that good and perfect will of God, Rom. 12.2. for the secrets of the Lord are revealed to none but such as feare him. Psal. 25.12, 14. Pro. 1.7. and 9.10.
2 Rule. He that would know the mind of God in Scripture, must earnest|ly beg for the direction and assistance of the spirit of God,Ben orasse est ben studuisse. Luther. Vbi Deus Ma|gister est, qum ci discitur, quod docetur. Leo. V. Bowles Pa|stor Evangel. page 117. that so he may be taught of God, to know and doe his will. Nature is blind here, 1 Cor. 2.14. the naturall man perceives not the things of God: he may peradventure know the History, but not the Mystery; hee may read the words, but shall never savingly know the mind of Christ without his spirit: 'tis this Eye-salve which must make us see, and lead us in|to all truth. We must therefore take Davids course, goe unto God by

Prayer,Hanc veram sapientiam non lectio docet, sed unctio; non litera, sed spiritus; non e|ruditio, sed ex|ercitatio in mandatis Do|mini. Ber. in Canto Ser. 37. Sine siritu ar|cana spirits quaerere, nihil est aliud qum fine luce vide|re velle. Rive. and beseech him to inlighten thy understanding, that thou mayest see in|to those deep mysteries, and wonders of his Law, [Psal. 119.18.] He that would have this wisdome, must aske it of God; for the Scripture can never be rightly interpreted without the assi|stance and teaching of that spirit, by whom they were inspired that wrote them. No Scripture is of private in|terpretation, [2 Pet. 1.20] that is pri|vate which is meerly of man, as ver. 21. private is not here opposed to publike, but to divine, or to the holy Ghost: Now our interpretations comming from the spirit, are falsely called pri|vate, because 'tis that spirit teacheth us, which teacheth all the faithfull. This is the chiefest work, and as it were the foundation of all the rest, without which all other meanes are vaine,Oationi lectio, lctioni succe|datoati, Hie. od Iaetam. Ad mentis puri|atm industria  exrcitati diligen st ad|ungenda. Rive. sagog ad script. cap. 18 p. 59. therefore begin and end with Prayer.
Now though a man be Godly, and have the spirit, yet he must use the means which God hath ordeined for the right understanding of Scrip|ture, for God will be found onely in his own way.
3. The Originall languages must be studied,Non est in lege vel una litera  qua non montes magni depende|ant. Rabbin. they have many speciall Idi|dioms, proprieties, phrases and elegan|cies, which cannot be fully expressed in our own o any other language, and therefore 'tis necessary that we under|stand them in some competent mea|sure; that so in our doubts we may have recourse to the fountain it selfe,Hebraei sontes hibunt, Graeci (1.) Sept. rivo, Latini paludes. Sphinx. from whence the waters drink most sweet|ly. The ignorance of Greek and He|brew hath been the cause of many er|rors in the Ancients, and especially a|mongst Monks and Fryars.Bonus Gram|matius, bonus Theologus. Till we un|derstand the words; we can never find out the sense; nor without them shall we be able to defend our selves, or of|fend an enemy. To give an instance or two,Bell. lib. 2 c. 12. de verbo Dei See more, D Prideaux fasci|cul. Q 5. p. 36. Gen. 3.15. the Vulgar Latine, Bel|larmine, and the School-boyes of D|way, say, [ipsa] shee shall break; we say ipse, he shall break. Now by having re|course to the Originall, the doubt is e|sily answered. The pronoun is Mascu|line [His] he,Evincit hoc Dotis. Prcus R. 8. in locum. or it, (i) the seed, Zera, which in the Hebrew is of the Mascu|line Gender: 'tis not [H] shee, in the Feminine Gender: the promise is con|fined to Christ, the promised seed, this

glory must not be given to his Mother, who ingenuously confesseth him to be a Saviour to her selfe, as well as unto o|thers, Luke 1.47. Thus the Rhemists would prove free-will from that Text, Luke 2.14. Peace on earth, to men of good will; but what saies the Origi|nall? the word is , which signi|fies Gods free love to us, but never our free will to good. So Ephes. 2.10. the Vulgar Latine saies we are Gods work|manship created in Christ, in operibus bonis, in good works; but our Translati|on saith, to good works; and so saith the Originall, , ad, non in.
Besides the tongues, a sound and so|lid interpreter had need of Rhetorick to understand Tropes and figures which are frequent in Scripture: also Logick to Analyse a Text, Philosophy, natu|rall morall, oeconomicall, with some knowledge in ecclesiasticall Histories; all which rightly improved will give us great light into the Scripture.
4. Ever observe very carefully the circumstances in a Text;Quis, cui, causa, locus, quo tem|poc, prima. Se|quela. as who speaks, when, to whom, the scope, the end, the matter, especially observe the context what goes before, and what followes.

The Rule of the Lawyers hold well here, Iudicandum non est de jure ex sola line . We must not judge of the Law by one line,Vt bs fun|damento imbe|cilla est aedifi|catio, ita nisi in|vento scopo Scriptura est mutilis. Chrys. Ex antecedenti|bus  conse|quentibus colli|gitur verus Scripturae sen|sus. Aug. Vide Hyperiu~ de ratione stu|dii Theolog. lib. 2. cap. 11.  Illyricum Tract. 1. page. 20, c. See m fully Master Roberts Preface to the Key of the Bible. page 43. and Bernards Faithfull Shep|herd lib. 4 cap. 2. page 188. but observe the drift and scope of the place; this gives great light to a Text, and helps to overthrow many er|rors. One sound Reason thus drawn from Scripture, is of more worth and strength then the opinions of a thou|sand Chrysostoms, Origens, Austins, c. Remember this distich of Glassius, Quis, scopus, impellens, sedes, tempusque, locusque,  modus; haec soptem, scripturae attendito loctor. The Author, Scope, oc|casion, Theam, Time, Place; and next, the Forme, these seven let him attend that reads the Text.
The Scripture lies not in the naked words,Ne putemus in verbis Scriptu|rarum esse Evangelium, sed in sensu; non in superficie, sed in medulla, no in sermonum foliis, sed in ra+dice rationis. Hieron. in Gal. 2. or letters, but in the true senic and scope of the words, there lies the life and soule of the Scripture. Mens le|gis est lex: not the bare words, but the meaning of the law is the Law.
5. Darke and hard places are to be expounded by plain ones for the Scrip|ture

is both Text and glose,Vnus locus per plra intelligi debet, obscura per apertiora. Aquinas pars 1. q. 1. aut 9. Scriptura est catenae similis, quae tota sii oset Chrys. Magnific  salubriter SSa Scriptuas mo|difiavit, ut lo|cis aprtioribus fami occurre|ret, obscuriri|bus autem a|stidia deterge|et nihil nim er de illis ob|scuritatibus e|ruit quod non plamssim di|ctum alibi repe|riatur. Aug lib. . cap. 6. de do+ctr. Christiana. Moris est Scrip|turarum obsu|ris manifesta Subictre. Scriptura est oratio una copulativa, qur na pars con|firmat, clucidat. exponit alieram.  and ever hath light in some place, to clear the darknese of others: one Scripture oft expounds, but never contradicts ano|ther. Amicae semper Scripturarum lites. In Scripture there are places where th Lamb may wade, and the Elephant may swimme; some places are clear and plaine to instruct our ignorance, others are dark and difficult, [2 Pet. 3.16.] to quicken our diligence, to make us dig and Nn dixit ligite Scriptras, sed srutamini (i) cum labore  diligentia ffodite ar|canos Scripturaam hesurs,  qum va metall aurum  argentum studiose scrutantu. Chrysostome. search, [Iohn. 5.39.] to make us fervent in Prayer, humble in meditati|on, to make us prize his word, which containes in it such high and heavenly mysteries, and to worke in us a love to the Ministery, which God hath set a|part for the opening of these mysteries. If ever wee would be good Interpre|ters, we must oft compare one place with another, and dark places with plaine; for what is obscure in one place, is made plain in another, so that the Scripture is the best expounder of it selfe. thus Isa 51.1. look to the rock

from whence you were hewne; what's that? ver. 2. to Abraham your Father, and Sarah your Mother. So Ioh. 6. Christ having spoken of eating his flesh, pre|sently adds, that he spake of a spirituall, not a corporall eating. Thus the Lord in his wisedome hath left some things dark to exercise us, that by search and comparing it with other Scriptures, we might be at last acquainted with the whole Scripture, and not rest conten|ted with the knowledge of some part of it, but might have it richly dwel|ling in us. Hence he makes the Prophets to expound Moses,See more Ber|nards Faihfull Shepherd. l. 4. c. 2. p. 192. and the Old Testa|ment is explained in the New. e. g. Exod. 3. I am that I am; what's that? the Prophet Isaiah will tell you, Isa. 48. I am the first and the last, (i) the eternall Jehovah. Thus Christ con|futes the Devill by comparing one place with another, Mat. 4.7. Those holy Levits, Mephorac exponendo sen|sum dabant in|telligentiam per scripturam  collatis testimo|niis demon|strans; Crti facti ex colla|tione Scriptu|rarum. See more fully Roberts Key. p. 59. Rule 8. Nehemiah 8.7, 8 and Paul in the Acts 9.22. and 16.10. They gave the sense, comparing Scripture with Scripture. Parallell Texts (like glasses) set one against a|nother, cast a mutuall light, and as the Lapidary brightneth his hard Diamond

with the dust shaved from it selfe: so must we clear hard Scriptures by o|thers that are plaine and perspicuous, as an Trap. com. on Mat. 4.7. acute and pious Divine hath wel observed.
6. We must beware of taking those words literally, which are to be un|derstood figuratively, or of taking things figuratively,In Scriptura explicanda ma|nifesta est haere|sis sicut figurata propri accipere, ita quae sunt propri dicta ad Tropicam locu|tionem detor|quere. Aug. de Doct, christ. l. 3. See more, Weemse 1 Vol. p. 231, 232, c. Vbi mal nemo pejus.
Fas est interpre|ti ex duabus interpretationi|bus cum utra textui congruit, alter utram abs|que vitio sequi. Ravenel. when they should be interpreted literally; wee may not make figures where the Scripture makes none, nor make it bleed with straining it too hard. This was Ori|gens fault, sometimes he would take that literally, which was to be un|derstood mystically; thus mistaking that place, Matthew 19.12. Hee gelt himselfe; and many times hee allegorizeth even plaine Scripture, and therefore often misseth the true sense. Now if a word admit of many significations, by the scope and circumstances of the place we may find, which is the most proper sig|nification; and where the Text will beare it, wee may make use of both.
7. All all our expositions must a|gree with the Analogy of Faith,

Romans 12. 6. Wee must Prophesie according to the proportion or ana|logy,2 Tim. 1.13. Heb. 6.1. Per analogiam intelligimus non tantim quod totidem verbis express in SS|reporitur, sed etiam quicquid ex iis . per con|sequentiam ne|cessariam dedu|citur D. Mor|ton, Apolog. Analogia est cum veritas u|nius Scripturae ostenditur veri|tati alterius non repugnare. Aq p. 1. q 1. art. 10. See more, Ber|nards Faithfull Shepheard. l. 4. c. 2. p. 184. [] of Faith; which is nothing else but the con|stant tenour of the Scripture, in the plain points of Religion, as the Arti|cles of our Faith, the Lords Prayer, the Creed, and the fundamentals in our Catechie, all which are proved by cleare Scripture. Now in expounding, still have an eye to this, and know, that what ever interpretation contradicts this Analogy of Faith, is alwaies false. e. g. this is my body, it cannot be true literally, because it is contrary to the Analogy of Faith, which tels us that Christs humane nature is ascended in|to Heaven, and the heavens must con|taine him till his second comming, Acts 3.21. it must therefore be understood figuratively. So Rom. 12.20. to feed our enemy, and give him drink, are to be taken literally; because they are agreea|ble to the Analogy of Faith; but to heap coales of fire on his head, must be taken figuratively, because in the letter it is contrary to the sixth Co mandement, So Mat. 5. 29. We should therefore take speciall care to be well grounded

in the fundamentals and principles of Religion; for ignorance is virtually e|very error. Mat. 22.29, yee err not know|ing the Scripture: and seminally 'tis every sin, this made Paul a persecutor, 1 Tim. 1.13. and the Jews to crucifie Christ, Acts 3.17.
8. You must come to this worke, with an humble heart. S. lict per se clarissima, su|verbis tamen est abscura ob co|rum caecitatem  pravum af|ectum. Luth. Purge out all pride, selfe-conceitednesse, and prejudi|cate opinions, lay aside all by-ends and aimes, become a fool in thy selfe, that thou maiest be wise in God, submit thy judgements, will and affections to his his will, and then he will teach thee, Ps. 25.9 Isay, 28 9. Mat. 11.25. God will not vouchsafe to shew us so much as the form of his house, till we are humbled, Ezek. 43.11. Mater omnium Haereticorum superbia. Aug. SS. Vult in i|more  humili|tate tractari,  magis studio piae orationis penetrari, qum acumine inge|nii. L de scrip. Sicut Demost in eloquentia, pronunciationi primas, secun|das, tertias de dit: ita ego in Christi sapien|tia primas, se|cundas tertias, dabo humilitati, quam Dominus noster ut doce|ret humiliatus est nascens, vi|vens, morens. Aug. A proud person is fit to make an heretick, he doth not take the sense which Scripture yields, but impo|eth his sence upon it; he is ready to in|terpret that for Gods wil, which is most sutable to his own, Psal. 50.21. these like the spider, turn all to poyson. Get an humble heart, and then thou wilt look on every truth of God, as infinitely above thee, and so wilt willingly re|ceive it from any; even a child with

Scripture-Reasons may lead thee,Veniat, venias verbum Domi|ni,  submitte|mus ei, sexcenta si nobis essent colla. Mel. Ada. Isa. 11.6 then, and never till then, wilt thou say with Baldassar, a Germane Divine, let the word of the Lord come, let it come, had we six hundred necks, they should all submit to it. We must not do (as many doe in our daies) who bring the Scripture in subjection to their opi|nions, conceits and practises,Is optimus in|terpres qui sensum  scrip|tura potis re|tulerit, quam attulerit, Hilar. when they should humbly and readily conform their opinions and practices to the scripture.
9. Ignorant persons that cannot use these meanes, must goe to such as are godly, and have skill, as the blind man that cannot see himselfe, will seek out for a guide. Ma. 2.7. the Priests lips must preserve knowledge, and the peo|ple must seek Gods Law at his mouth. They must read good books, get sound Commentators, conferre much, humbly suing to God for direction, who first or last will resolve our doubts. To the diligent hand that makes rich in spiritu|als as well as temporals, and if we be active for knowledge, and in despight of all oppositions, can follow on to know the Lord, he hath then promised that we shall Cognitione ap|probationis, no apprehensionis experimentali  affectiv, non discursiv know him, Hos. 6.3. If

we be diligent in searching, God will be faithfull in revealing; and if we sin|cerely doe our duty, we shall quickly find the blessing.
Bonum est scire  sequi.10. Practice the truth, when the Lord shall make known any truth to you, presently obey it, and submit to it, so shall you know more of Gods mind, Iohn 7.17.Via rect judi candi de doctri|na est, si praepa|etur animus udio placendi Deo  faciendi ipsius volunta tem. Rolloc. in Iob. when our workings and walkings bee Scripture-explications. God then delights to reveal himselfe unto us: if David will but keep the precepts of the Lord, he shall be wiser then the Ancient, wiser then his Tea|chers, [Psal. 119.98.99, 100.] and wi|ser then his subil enemies. Oh then let our practice come up to our light, and our Gospell-principles be answered with Gospell-conversations, and our Gospell-light, with Gospell lives; for then the Lord finding us faith|full in a little, will shew us yet greater things, Phil. 3.15. and if we be carefull to obey his truth, he hath then promised to give us his spirit, [Acts 5.32.] which shall be in us a spring of illumination, sanctification, consolation, c.
11. Words of knowledge imply af|fection

and practice,Recordatio Dei notat cuum Dei: ut impii oblivisci Deo dicutur. Sibel. Ecl. 12.1. Re|member (i) know, fear, love and obey God. So 1 Cor. 11.24. doe it in re|membrance of me; (i) with care, fer, love, delight; for 'tis not a bare Histo|ricall remembrance, but a sin crucify|ing, soul-affecting remembrance. So Deut. 8 11, 18. Psal. 1.9, 17. and 106. 21. and 1.6. 2 Tim. 2 19.
12. The Hebrews instead of an Epithet,Vanitas vani|tatum, est Hebr. (i) summa, va|nissima vanitas. v.  Lap. in Eccles. 1.2. ubi plura.
Homo ille me|rum scelus: haec enim est vis idi|otismi Hebraei|ci. Beza.
Col. .13. filius dilectionis (i) dilectus  3.12. viscera mise|cordiae (i) vis|ceralem miseri|cordiam. doe put the substantive in the genitive case; as men of mercy, for mercifull men a land of desolation (i) a very desolate land, a man of desires, (i) a man very desirable and lovely, Dan. 9.23. the son of perdition (i) one or|dained for damnation, Iohn 17.12. The man of sin, 2 Thes. 2.3. there is an em|phasis in it (i) a very sinfull man, a man made up of wickednesse, being as it were sin it selfe in the abstract. So Ben|mavoth, a son of death, 1 Sam. 20.31. (i) one that shall surely dye; a sonne of Belial (i) one notoriously wicked, 1 Sam. 2.12. so Eph. 2.3. children of wrath. (i) by nature we are all poor, damned, undone creatures' 'Tis an Hebraifme very frequent in Scripture: hence Christ is called a man of sor|rows,

Isaiah. 53.3. (i) a man even com|pacted and compounded of all kinds and degrees of sorrows.Vir dolorum (i) undique dolori|bus obsius, ex doloribus con|flatus,  non nisi dolor, im pelagus dolorum esse videretur.  Lap. So Ieremy (15.10.) was counted a man of contenti|ons (i) an exceeding contentious man: thus Genitives are put for Adjectives, and doe increase the signification.
13. One proper name is oft given in Scripture to severall persons: as the name of Pharaoh,Pharaonis voca|bulum non per|sona~, sed digni|tatem notat. was a common Title to all the Kings of Egypt; Ioseph stands before one Pharaoh, Moses is sent to another, c. V. Ravanel. in verbo Pha|rao. Writers observe ten of that name in Scripture, as the Philistines called their Kings Abime|lech, and the Romans called their Em|perours, Caesar; so the Egyptians called their Kings by the name of Pharaoh. Thus we read of three Herods. 1. He|rod the Ascalonite, in whose raigne Christ was born. Mat. 2.1. 2. Herod the Tetrarch, who beheaded Iohn. 3. Herod Agrippa, who killed Iames, Acts 12.
14. When a Text admits of seve|ral interpretations, which must I chuse? 1. Observe the Context, the scope and drift of the place, and see which exposi|tion agrees best with that, and cleave

to that; its stronger then the sayings of a thousand Origens, Austins, c. 2. Ob|serve which agrees best with the Ana|logy of faith, and other places of Scrip|ture. e. g. Pro. 25.21, 22. Rom. 12.20. If thy enemy hunger, feed him, c. by so doing thou shalt heap coales of fire on his head: Some by coales here un|derstand, coales of confusion;Intellige carbo|nes ignis esse u|rentes poeniten|t ae gemitus, qui|bus superbia sa|natur ejus qui dolet se inimi|cum fisse ho|minis  quo ejus msrie seri subve|mur. Aug. de Doct. Christ. l. 3. cap. 16. others coales of conversion; though both may stand, yet the last is farre more safe and genuine 1. Because it agrees best with the Context, which forbids private re|venge, and commands us to love our enemies, as ver, 19. before the Text, and ver. 21. after plainly shew, be not over|come with evill, but overcome evill with good, (i) by thy goodnesse, and unex|pected kindnesse, thou shalt so melt and humble him, (as a great fire makes the hardest Iron and Steel to melt) that of a foe he shall become a friend. 2. This ex|position is most agreeable to the Analo|gy of faith, which commands us to love our neighbour, yea though he be our enemy, and to seek his good, but never his ruine: now that sense which cals us from malice to charity, is ever best. Thus that act of Naaman, [2 Kings 5.17, 18.]

in going to the house of Rim|mon, is very much controverted; some say he sinned in so doing, others as god|ly and as learned, say no: what shall we here doe? scan the Text, and we shall find it probable, that he did not sin: For 1. 'Tis concluded by all, that Naaman was a true convert, and the Text clears it. 1. He will doe nothing without the Prophets direction and approbati|on. 2. Whereas before he was an I|dolater, and sacrificed to false-gods, now he resolves to worship onely the true God. ver. 17. and if so, is it likely that hee would desire a toleration to sinne? or doth he not rather beg pardon for his former Idolatry; for the words may be read in the Preter Tense, as well as in the Future. q. d. the Lord pardon thy servant, that when my Master went to the house of Rimmon to worship there, and leaned on my hand, and I bowed my selfe,Fuit curvatio Politica  civi|lis, non eligiesa.  Lap. Obsequium suit Domino debi|tum  ser o, id null  ege probitum. Sanctius c. 3. Naamans bowing, was not a Religious worship given to the Idol, (for he had openly disclaimed all Idolatry before) but his bowing was onely in a civill respect, that the King might lean on his shoul|ders, and this he did, (as Mr Perkins

well observes) with open and publick protestation, that he would worship none but the true God, and therefore to him he resolves to build an Altar in his own Country.Haee verba sunt ejus, qui postula|ta concedit. San. 4. The Prophet would never have bid him goe in peace, had he begged for a toleration in Idolatry; for what peace can there be to the wicked?
Ob. He begs for pardon, therefore he sinned in what he did.
Ans. He being tender conscienc'd,Consule G. Ab|bat Praelect. 42 p. 160, c. and scrupulous (as most young converts are) craves pardon for this his bowing, though but in a civill respect, as fea|ring it might be interpreted a Religi|ous worshipping of the Idol, c. This is a charitative interpretation, and they say it is best offending on this hand: love takes doubtfull things in the best sense.Dubia in parte meliori sunt in|terpretanda. See more Weemse. 2. vol. l. 1. Ch. 3. p. 100 Wendelin Theolog. l. 1.6.24. p. 601.
Take but one more perplexed Text, and I have done, Eccl. 7.16. Be not righteous over-much, c. 1. Say some, these are not the words of Solomon, but of the Atheist, and carnall Polititian, who hearing ver. 15. of the righteous mans perishing in his righteousnesse, and the wicked mans prolonging his

daies, presently the carnall man with his corrupt reason concludes, Be not then righteous over much. q. d. see|ing righteous men fare so ill,Dum furor in cursu est, cur|enti cede furo|ri, say Politici|ans. carry things with indifferency, and be not too precise and too holy, and more wise then other men; be discreet and wary lest thou bring thy selfe into danger and trouble.
Loquitur de justitia illa se|vera qu saep proximos judi|camus. Scarpi|us.2. Say others, here is condemned all rigour in Justic, whether vindictive, distributive, or commutative. Magi|strates must not be too severe in exe|cuting extream justice on every slight occasion and sin of infirmity;Est Iustitia ab|soluta, sic nemo justus; Iustitia inchoata sic ju|stus prit, justi+tia aequivoca sic ne sis justus nimis. v. coni. Dr Halli coram Synod. Dordreit. p. 41 but they must use a discreet moderation and equity, not being too severe on the one hand, nor yet too remisse in sparing or favouring wickednesse on the other hand: So private persons must not stand too much upon their own right, nor yet suffer their innocence to be too much wronged but in charity and wise integrity we should yield sometimes to others, considering our humane frail|ty.
3. Some conceive that here is con|demned curiosity and carelessnesse. q.d. doe not curiously search into those my|steries

which are not revealed; lest by thy pride and curiosity, thou bring Gods judgements on thy selfe; nor yet be so wicked and carelesse as to neglect the truth that is revealed.
4. Say others,Propri nullus est nimis justus, temperaus, c. quia qu major est justitia vel virtus,  est perfectior.  Lp. here is condemned, not true righteousnesse, or true wise|dome, (for so we can never be too righ|teous, too wise, or too religious and for|ward; in justice, as it is justice, wee cannot exceed, though in respect of the circumstances, as the persons to whom, when, and where we do justice, we may exceed or come short, as Pro. 17.17. to condemne the just is the excesse, and to spare the wicked, is the defect of justice) but Solomon here condemnes phariaicall righteousnesse; when men are not content with the righteousnesse which Gods word reveales, but out of their pride and selfe-conceitednesse, they will have a righteousnesse of their own beyond the word; thus the Pha|risces trusted so much to their owne righteousnesse, traditions and works, that they contemned Christ. These, these are the men that are over-righte|ous: such are Papists and all will-wor|shippers with their merits, works of

supererogation,Quisquis plus justo non sapit, ille sapit. Ma. c. Thus the Anabap|tists are over-righteous and rigid, they boast of their perfection; when he that hath but halfe an eye, may plainly see their grosse imperfections; they tell us that the Church must not be a mixt society, they  ust all be Saints, reall Saints say some, c. What is this but to be over-wise; even wise above that which is written? Vanitas c nota|tu hypocritarum ostenantium non suas vir utes, sed virtutum umbras quibus prae aliis semper apparere student. R gidi slnt esse viriutis satellites  praecones, neque satis est iis si sint reiquis simi|les, qui nscio quia peculiare semper af|fectant. ayus in locum.See more fully Mr Baxters CC. Direction 26. Though I shall condemne none of these opinions, yet the second and the last in my judge|ment are most sound, agreeing best with the context and analogy of faith.
V. Pagnin l. 3. inst. cap. 12.15. The Hebrews often use the Im|perative Mood for the Future Tense, to shew the certainty of a thing, as Amos 5.6 Seek the Lord, and live yee (i) yee shall certainly live. So Deut. 32.49.50. The Lord bids Moses goe up to Munt Neoo and dye there (i) thou shalt cer|tainly dye there and on the contrary,

they sometimes put the Future Tense for the Imperative Mood, as Exod. 20. thou [shalt] not kill, steal c. for doe not kill, steal, c. So Mal. 2.7 shall preserve knowledge (i) let them preserve knowledge.
16. Then a thing is said to be done in Scripture phrase,Res tum de|mm dicuntur fieri, cum incipi|a manifesta|ri. Reg. Patrum. when it begins to be done; Thus Ieremy tels the people that after 70 years captivity in Baby|lon, they should returne from thence, yet many were left in Babylon after that time; but because the returne from thence beganne that year, therefore its said to be done then.T crucifixe|runt actum in|choatum signifi|cat, non perfe|ctum.  Lap. in Iohn. 19.14. Thus Christ is said to be crucified at the third houre. Marke 15.25. becaue the Jews then cryed, crucifie him, crucifie him, and Pilate consented to them, comman|ding that he should be scouged, and as it were prepared for the Crosse, but at the end of the third houre, the sixth be|ginning, Pilate juridically condemned him, and presently they crucified him. Marke then declares the originall and beginning of Christs Crucifying at the third houre, but Matthew [27, 46] with the rest, set forth the execution and complement of it at the sixth houre; or

dividing the day into four quarters (3 houres to each quarter) it was in the third of them, that Christ was Cruci|fied.
In illis quae Metaphoric di|cuntur, non opor|tet accipere si|militudinens secundum om|nia. Reg. Schola.17. In Parables we must alwaies look more to the sense and scope, then to the letter. Now in a Parable there are three things considerable.

1. Cortex, the words and termes.
2. Radix, the scope it aimes at.
3. Fructus, the fruit which may be gathered from thence.

Theologia sym|bolica, sive pa|rabolica, non est argumentativa. Aquinas.Hence we say, that borrowed spee|ches make no grounded Arguments; they illustrate, but they prove nothing; they are comparisons, but not founda|tions. Thus Mat. 13.24, 25, c. The Parable of the Tares mixed with the Wheat, doth not argue a toleration of all ects, but the scope of it is to shew that there wil be a mixture of good and bad in the Church to the end of the world.
Meisis.18. In Scripture many times lesse is spoken then is  ear as Psal. 51.17. a broken heart God will not despise (i) he highly prizeth a broken heart. So

1 Thes. 5.20. despise not prophesying (i) see that you highly prize the prea|ching of the word.Iob 5.17. 1 Tim. 4.12. and Tit. 2.15. 1 Sam. 12, 21. which cannot profit (i) which will greatly hurt you. Ier. 32.35. which I have not com|manded (i) I have seveerly forbidden. So Heb. 10 38. if any apostatise, Gods soule will take no pleasure in them (i) hee detests and ab|hors them 1 Cor. 10.5. but with many of them, God was not wel pleased (i) he was highly displeased. Psal. 22.6. Pro. 24.23. 'tis not good (i) it's very evil, Exod. 20.7. not hold him guiltlesse (i) he will certainly punish him, Mat. 12.32. never remitted (i) certainly puni|shed.
19. In Scripture there are also ma|ny hyperbolicall speeches, by way of amplification; as, thy seed shall be as the sand of the Sea. Gen. 32.12. 1 Sam. 13.5. Psal. 78.27. as the starres of Hea|ven. Heb. 11.12. as the dust of the earth, Gen. 13.16. Numb. 23.10. a land flowing with milk and hony, Exod. 3.17. I will make your Heavens Iron, and your earth brasse, Levit. 26.19. Swifter then Eagles, stronger then Lyons, 2 Sam. 1.23. Iudges 20.16. Rivers of teares run down mine eyes, Psal 119.136. not a tear or two, but abundance of teares. So Psal. 46.2, 3. and Iohn 21. ult, by these in|stances 't will be easie to observe more.
Scriptores sacri in itandis. V. T. testimoniis non tam verba se|quuntur aut nu|merant, qum expendunt sen|tentias, quae si serventur de verborum qua|litate ac nume|ro non laborant. Sanctius. Christ and his Apostles did follow the Septuagint, which gives the sense and not the words See more fully Weemsee Iewish Synag. c. 4. p. 61, c. D. Prid. fascicul. cont. Q. 3 page. 24. 1 Aeternum pro diuturno. Hyper|bole. 2. Typic aeternum. So Canaan was a type of Hea|ven an eternal inheritance. 3. Catachreste aeternum, that which endured a long time, was said to be eternall, thus circumcision was a covenant for ever (i) till Christ came, Weemse. 1 Vol. p. 259.20. Christ and his Apostles citing testimonies out of the Old Testament, doe often follow the Septuagint, ren|dring the sense but not the words, be|cause the Scripture lies not in the bare words and syllables, but in the sense and meaning. Hence sometimes they change something for illustration. Thus Michah 5.1. compared with Mat. 2.6. Micah cals Bethlehem little, in respect of outward pompe and riches; Mat|thew cals it famous and great, because Christ should be born there. Thus Mal. 3.1. with Mat. 11.10. and Hos. 1.6. with Rom. 9.25. sometimes they omit a word, sometimes they add something for explication sake, as Mat. 2.15, 23. and 26.31. Rom. 10.15, 18, 19, 20, 21. 1 Cor. 2.9.
21. These words [for ever, and from Generation to Generation, c.] do oft signifie in Scripture phrase, not eternity, but onely that which shall en|dure a long time, for some ages and Ge|nerations of men, as Gen. 13.15. and 17.8. Exod. 28.29. Levit. 25.46. Deut. 15,

17. 1 Chro. 15.2. Psal. 132.14. and so the word [no more] doth not totally deny, but onely signifies many times some delaying of time, as 1 Sam. 7.13. the Philistines came [no more] into the Coast of Israel: how can this be, when it is apparent they came divers times after, both in the daies of Samu|el, Saul and David?See Mr Leigh Heb. Crit. in verbo Golam. p. 374. fol. the answer is ea|sie, q. d. The Philistines were so shat|tered and broken by the immediate hand of God, that they durst [no more] at this time, adventure to set upon Isra|el. So Isaiah 23.12.V. plura apud Slmeron. Pro|legomen. 13. formul. 29. Ezek. 26.13, 14. Tyre shall sing [no more] nor be built [any more] yet after some time shee was re-built and returned to her for|mer mirth and Merchandise.
22. False, unprofitable, uselesse things, in Scripture-dialect, are accoun|ted as no things: thus a wicked grace|lesse, unrighteous man, is accounted as no man, Ieremy 5.1. run to and fro through the streets of Ierusalem, and see if you can find [a man] why? the streets were full of men, yea, but be|cause they were not good men, God ac|counts them as no men. Thus the wic|ked are said to have [no heart] Hos 7.11.

i. no heart to goodness, and then as good have no heart at all. Thus the wicked are said [not to hear] the law, because they doe not hear it rightly, obediently. Thus the Priests are said [not to know] the Lord, Ier. 2.8. they were Priests, and so could not be totally ignorant, but because their knowledge was meerly notionall and speculative, without obe|dience and practise, God esteems it as no knowledge.
23. By an Euphemismus or Anti-phrasis, the Scriptures sometimes put a faire name on a foule vice. Thus, I Kin. 21.13. Naboth is said [to blesse God and the King] (i) to curse them. So Iob 1.5. it may be my sons have sinned; and [Ba|ruch, have blessed God] (i) have ursed him.See more Weemse. 1. Vol. l. 2. c. 3. p. 247, c. Thus the vessell wherein Nature doth ease it selfe, is vailed with the pe|riphrasis, a vessell wherein is no plea|sure, Ier. 22.28. Hos. 8.8. So Deut. 23.15. Iudges 3.24. and 14.18. Iob 31.10. Psal. 51. Title. David went in to Bathshebah. So Rom. 1.24, 26, 27.
24. 'Tis a safe way, where a Text admits of many (but not contrary) sen|ses to take in all, lest we misse the meaning: where no reason doth con|strain,

we are not to restrain the words, but may take them in the largest sense, if there be nothing to hinder us, neither matter, phrase, context, or scope; no|thing contrary to other Scriptures, nor the analogy of faith; then may you take all; for in a Scripture which may without impeachment of any truth, ad|mit divers senses, I may not be so posi|tive in one, as to reject all others. e. g. Pro. 23.23. buy the truth, what truth? why truth in judgement, truth in affe|ction, truth in doctrine, truth in disci|pline, truth in words, and truth in works: all these must we labour for, but the two first being most genuine, and the foundation of all the rest, are prin|cipally to be sought after. So Ephes. 5.16. Redeem the time, why but the word is , opportunitas temporis; yet be|cause the word is taken promiscuously in the New Testament, we may make use of both, and say, redeem time, and especially the seasons of time. Thus in that much tortured Text, 1 Cor. 12.7. There was given me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me. Interpreters vary here very much: so many men, so many opinions, so

that as one saith in a like case,Nescio an hic locus acilior su|isset si nemo cum exposuisset. Maldonat. Caro hc meo judicio non cor|pus, sed partem animae nondum regeneratam significat; q. d. mihi daus est stimulus quo caro mea punge|retur: ne enim adhuc sum ad  spiritualis cum obnxious sim tentationibus scundum car|nem. Calvin in locum. I think this Text had been clearer, if some had never medled with it, especially the Ancients are much mistaken about this thorn in the flesh, c. 1. Some of them thinke it to be some bodily sick|ness, some say 'twas a perpetuall head|ach, others, the gout, or a paine in the small guts, or weaknesse of stomack, or fleshly lusts, or at least some disease laid on him by the Devill: these are most of them ridiculous.Would the magna|nimous Apostle (think wee) that had gone thorough so many difficulties and dangers, have begged so oft and earnest|ly to be delivered from a poor disease? nor is it probable that so mortified, so laborious, so temperate a man, should be troubled with lust, or if it had been so, no doubt but he would have used that remedy, which he prescribed to others in that case, 1 Cor. 7 9. besides, the reme|dy being spirituall, v 9. it is not proba|ble that the malady was corporall: others think this thorn to be some cru|ell persecutor, such as Alexander the Copper-Smith, of whom he oft com|plaines, 2 Tim. 4.14. he by his persecu|tion and reproaches, seemed to be the

Devils agent to buffet him, but this sense is stil too narrow, for these were but ex|ternall thorns, of which the Apostle used to glory, and not complain.
3. Others more genuinely take it metaphorically, for internall temptati|ons, which are fitly called Hoc in medi|tato habeant qui praestant eximi|is virtutibus: si qua habeant admissa vitia, si quibus odiis impetantur, si quibus sugil|lentur maledi|ctis, non tan|tm erulas es|scaelstis mgi|stri, sd cola|phos, qui vere|cundtam incuti|ant,  retun|d omne suer|b  seraciam. Calv. in locum. buffetings, because they come so thick upon a man, that he can hardly take breath; the Devil dogs good hearts with foulest lusts, sometimes with Atheisme, Idolatry, blasphemy, c. in all or any of which, if the soul be meerly passive, (as the word buffeting here implies) they are Satans sins,  our crosses onely; and therefore the most pious and judicious, doe con|ceive this thorn in the flesh,  By the mes|ssenger of Sa|tan, some con|ceive i meant, some sin where|unto Paul was tempted, as a means to keep him humble, for nothing is matter of so great humilia|tion to a gra|cious hear, as the feeling of the power and strength of sin within it. messen|ger of Satan, to be some inward corrup|tion edg'd with a temptation, which Sa|tan stirred up in his heart to vex him; or originall corruption set on by the Devil; others conceive it to be a wound in the spirit, the sting of conscience pressing him downe to the lowest hell, (in his own sense) who before was taken up to the highest heavens; and this seems best to agree with the scope of the place, for ver. 7. he tels us, that he had abun|dance of Revelations ias at his first con|version,

Acts 9.5. 2. When hee was called to Macedonia, Acts 16.9. 3. When he went to Corinth, Acts 18.9. 4. When he was sent to the Gen|tiles. Acts 22.17. 5. When he was in danger of shipwrack, Acts 27.23. and here when he was caught up into the third Heaven,, est aculeus cor|por nhaerns, vel spin pedem pungens. Ego sub hoc vocabu|lo comphendi arbitror omne genus tentao|nis quo Paul, exerbatur. Calvin v. 2.] Now lest the Apostle should be exalted above mea|sure [he doubles that saying] God in his wisedome lets Satan loose upon him, to humble him, to buffet and vex him, and keep him low: now because this somewhat hindered him for a while in the chearfull discharge of his calling; it's fitly compar'd to a thorne in the foot, with which a man cannot goe but lamely, and with very great paine, c. Briefly, the Paraphrase may be this, q. d. God hath vouchsafed me many glorious Revelations, with the number of which lest I should be exalted, and too much puffed up (as our fraile nature is easily transported) there was through the holy permission, and wise ordination of God,Attendant om|nes pii quantum sit superbae ve|nenum, quod non po nisi vene|no curai. Aug. way given to some strong and violent corruption, edged with a temp|tation from Satan, to humble and afflict me, lest I should be exalted above mea|sure;

whereupon I oft and earnestly besought God, that he would be plea|sed to rebuke the empter, and to free me from those violent injections, which Satan darted in upon me, and from those troublesome suggestions of the fiend: But he said unto me, content thy selfe to wrastle a while with this temptati|on, knowing that 'tis sufficient that I doe by my power defend thee, and by my grace uphold thee from the prevai|ling power thereof; besides, the glory of my power will be the more seen in thy weaknesse,Consideemus diligenter quis hc loquatur, vi|cerat tot pricu|la, tormenta  alia mala; tri|umphum de om|nibus Christi hostibus egerat, expulerat mor|tis timorem, mundum renun|tiaverat, nec|dum tamen sub|egerat penits suerbiam; im ad anceps illi certamen resta|bat, ut vincere non posset nisi colaphis caesus Calv in locum. c. Now when Paul saw that God gained glory, and him|selfe humility by it, he was contented to beare it, yea he resolves to glory in it, since he saw it was a medicine to cure him of pride, and not a poyson to destroy him: So that here as in a glass, we may see why the Lord suffers his choisest servants to be vext by Satan, and afflicted with variety of temptati|ons. viz. to hide pride from their eyes, and to keep their graces in exercise; I shall shut up all with that excellent counsell of Musculus on the place. Cogitandum est hc prohomini, qum pro|clive sit carni ut propter qualemcnque

praerogativam infletur ac superbiat: ete|nim si hoc erat Apostolo tot laboribus ac periculis depresso sque ade timendum, ut singulari quadam antidoto opus ha|beret, per quod contra tentationem super|biae in humilitate ac modestia continere|tur; quid nobis non est multo timendum amplius qui et si parem revelationum ex|cellentiam consequuti ron sumus mult tamen minus habenius roboris ad resi|stendum tentationibus superbiae, quan|tumcunque levibus ac minutis, qum habuerit ille contra tam graves superbi|endi occasiones. Quare admoum desi|piunt qui studio dignitates ac honores in hoc saeculo ambiunt, non considerantes quantis seipsi periculis obnoxios reddant.
Now in this variety of opinions, I shall leave the judicious Reader to his choice. Ego enim facil patior unum|quemque abundare suo sensu. Luther.
25. Some numbers in Scripture have a kind of eminency and excellency in them; especially these three: Three, Six and Seven.Numerus Ter|narius symbolum est multitudinis  universita|tis tria enim sum o~nia. scili|cet, pma. Aris. Hence the Scripture when they would inlarge or multiply the sense, they use one of these numbers. Thus Ier. 7.4. They cry the Temple of the Lord, the Temple, the Temple (i) they

did oft repeat that word. So Ier. 22.29. O earth, earth, earth, heare the word of the Lord; that threefold re|petition makes the speech more em|phaticall and vigorous. So Ezek. 21.27. I will overturne, overturne, overturne it, (i) I will mightily and surely overturn it. So when the Angell would shew the greatnesse of Gods plagues, he cries, wo, wo, wo, Rev. 8.13. Thus Eccl. 4.12. a threefold cord (i) a cord of many folds. So the most holy God, is proclaimed the thrice Holy God, Isaiah 6.3. Thus even Heathen Authors have used the word,O trque quantrque bea|ti. Virg. and when we would expresse the greatnesse of a mans happinesse or honour, wee stile him thrice happy, thrice honourable, c. Thus the number three implies compleatnesse and excel|lency, as Exod. 23 14, 17. and 25.32. and 27.1. Deut. 17.6. and 19.7, 9. 2. The number six, notes perfection, as may be seen in the worke of Creation, the Lord could as easily have made the world in a moment, as in six daies; but the Lord saw it good to take a compleat number of daies, for so compleat a work, Gen. 1. ut. Thus when the Lord would bring a full and compleat judge|ment

on wicked Gog,Agit de pleno Gog interu  excidio.  Lap Numerus sep tenarius signifi+cat in scriptu|ris. 1. Multitu|dinem. 2. Perfe|ctionem. Percuam vos plen, perfect  multiplici plag.  Lap. Ezek. 39.2. sex|tabo te. I will smite thee with six plagues (as in the Margin of our Bibles) (i) I will punish thee full sorely. 3. Se|ven is a famous number, implying, 1. multitude. 2 perfection, Levit. 26.18, 21, 24, 28. I will plague you yet seven times more (i) many times more, or more extreaely. Deut. 28.7. they shall flee before thee seven waies (i) many ways, a certain number for an uncertain Gen. 4.15. vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold (i) he shall have mani|fold punishment.V. Seenarii numeri vim a|pud Anl. Gell. l. 3 c. 10. Ruth 4.15. better to thee then seven sons (i) then many sons. So Psal. 12.6. and 119.164. Pro. 24.16. and 26.25. falleth seven times (i) he fal|leth oft into trouble, yet riseth againe. 1 Sam. 2 5. the barren hath borne seven (i) many, shee is a compleat mother, and hath a flourishing family. So Micah 5.5. Zech. 3.9. Mat. 12.45. seven un|clean spirits (i) a multitude of Devils, c.
26. Ordinary examples of the Saints approved in Scripture, being against no generall precept, have the force of a generall rule, and are to be followed, yet in following examples we must observe.

1. How they did a thing. 2. When they did it. 3. Where they did it. 4. Why they did it, as the learned Weemse hath well observed,Weemse Iew|ish synag l 2 ch. 5. p. 265. to whom I shall refer you for full satisfaction in this point. See more, Rule 50.
27. The order of time is not alwaies kept in Scripture, but sometimes that is placed first which was done last;In scriptura non est prius  posterius. the Saints looked more at the sstance, then at small circumstances in their writings; and therefore the placing of things must not be strictly urged in Scripture; for 'tis usuall by a prolepsis or anticipation of time to relate that first which is last, as Iohn 11.2. 'tis said Mary anointed the Lord,T unxit acci|pitur non de un|ctione praeteri|ta, sed futura, per anticipatio|nem.  Lap. yet 'tis men|tioned in the next Chapter per ,  est una de regulis ad intelli|gndam scripturam sanctam necessariis. Luth. loci com. p 75.
28. Arguments drawn from silent au|thority,Argumentum ab authoritate egnte, sed non ab authoritate negativa, vlet in Theologicis. in matters of fact, conclude no|thing. e. g. there is no mention made of Adams repentance of his sacrificing or performing any pious exercise whilst he lived on earth yet it doth not fol|low therefore, he did none of these things. We read of no parents Melchi|sedech

had, yet we cannot therefore conclude that he had none: if all should be written, the world it selfe could not containe the books, Iohn 21. ult. and therefore it will not follow,There are five kinds of que|stions in Scrip|ture. 1. Q. Du|bitans, a doubt|ing question, as Psal 77.7, 8. 2. Q. Docens,  teachig Q. Is. 60.8. it tea|cheth us the multitude of those tht shall lck after the means of grace 3. Qu Discns, Mak 10 16. he desies to learn the way to Heaven. So Acts 2.37. 4. Q. Airmans, 2 Kin. 12 19.  14.18. Ier. 23.29. 5. Q. Ne|gans, as Psa. 19.12. who can understand his errours (i) no man can un|derstand the full depth of them. Abbot. because the Scripture doth not mention such a thing, therefore it was not done.
29. Hee that will understand the Proverbs, must marke their opposition, if Parables, their scope, if other places, their dependance.
30. Interrogations (oft times) are emphaticall and strong affirmations or negations, as Gen. 4.7. if thou doe well, shalt thou not be accepted? this inter|rogative is in sense a vehement assertive or affirmative. q. d. thou shalt surely be accepted both thou and thy sacrifice, if thou dost well. Thus Gen. 13.9. and 37.13. Ioshua 1.9, 10, 13. have not I com|manded the? (i) I have without all question assuredly commanded thee, for this interrogation with the Hebrews, is a strong affirmation. So Gen. 37.13. 2 Sam. 13.28. 2 Kings 6.32. Iohn 4.35. Marke 12.24. and Ier. 23.23, 24. 2. Sometimes they are strong denials, as Gen. 18.14. is any thing too hard for God? Mat. 12.26. Rom 3.3. and 10.14,

15.3. Sometimes questions doe di|minish and abate the sense, Zech. 4.7. Who art thou O great mountaine? thou lookest very big and great,See more fully  Hyric. Cla. de Tropis. p. 211. but who art thou? I will tell thee O proud op|pressr, and opposer of my people, though in thy owne conceit thou art a Mountaine invisible, unmoveable, yet in my peoples eyes thou art but a mole|hill, and shalt shortly be made a nothing, even as a plain before them. Thus when David would abate himselfe, he cries, who am I? what is my house? 2 Sam. 7.18. 4. Sometimes they intend, raise, and heighten the sense, by way of admi|ration, Ps. 8.10. Exod. 15.11. Who is a God like unto thee? let all the world if they can, shew such a God as thou art. So M. 7.18. the question puts the brightest glory upon God, in pardoning sin; there is no sin-pardoning God, but our God only. 5. Sometimes they are expostulato|ry,  complain, Ps. 22.1. Why hast thou forsaken me? Ier. 12.1. Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper?Epitasis sive auxsis est non vulgaris cum affirmatur ali|quid,  contra|rii ipsius adjun|gitur negatio. Sanct. Is. 1.21.
31. When the Scripture would strongly affirme, it doth it oft times by denying the contrary. So Isaiah 38.1. thou shalt dye, and not live, Ezek. 18.

21. (i) thou shalt certainly die. Deut. 28.13. he shall make thee the head, and not the taile. Iohn 1.20. he confessed and denyed not. Isaiah 39.4. Ier. 42.4. (i) Deus est lux purissima. 1 Iohn 1.5. 'tis very familiar with the Hebrews, by affirming and denying to expresse the same thing for stronger confirmation of it. Negatio contrarii auget vim affirmaionis. Deut. 33.6. Pro. 30.11. 1 Sam. 1.11. Iohn. 20.27.
32. The Scripture speaks many things negatively, which are to be understood onely comparatively, as Hos. 6.6. Mat. 9.13. I will have mercy, and not sacri|fice. (i) comparatively, I desire mercy [rather] than sacrifice. So So Iohn 6.4. and Heb. 8 11. 1 Cor. 3.. and 15 10. So Gen. 32.28. (i) he shall rather be called Israel, then Iacob. Pr. 8 10 (i) buy wisedome ra|ther then gold. Luke 14.12, 13. (i) rather the or then the rich Eph. 6.12. Luke 9.56. Ioh. 3.17. Ier. 31.34. they shall no more teach every man his neighbour. The words must not be ta|ken simply,  negativ, for a pure nega|tion (as some Libertines would con|strue them) but comparatively, (i) there shall be farre greater knowledge and clearer light under the new Testament, then was under the Old, Isa. 11.9. not that there shall be no teaching at all, (for Christ hath given some to be Pa|stors and Teachers, Ephes. 4.11, 12.) but in Gospell times they shall not onely be taught by men, but they shall be taught

inwardly and experimentally by God himselfe,q. d. they shall not evey man teach his neighbour, so obscuely by Ceremonies, Types and Fi|gures. Isa. 54.13. his spirit shall lead them not onely unto, but into truth, Ioh. 16.13. So 1 Cor. 1.17. not to baptize. (i) comparatively, Christ sent mee rather to preach then to baptize, 1 Iohn 3.18. love not in word [onely] but [rather] indeed and in truth,So Psal. 51.16.17. the words must not be ta|ken   absolut, sed comparat. q.d. tis not so much the outward, as the Inward sacrifice which God requires. In co~parationi|bus saep nega|tur illud quod no~ est excluden|dum, sed tan|tm alteri post|ponendum. Dav. Mark 9.37. he re|ceives not me, but him that sent me (i) he [rather] receives the father sending, then me sent, because he receives me for his sake, Col. 3.23. doe it as to the Lord, and not o men (i) rather to the Lord then to men, because yee serve them for the Lord Christs sake.
33. When the Hebrews would ex|presse any excellent, great, or glori|ous thing, they oft join the name of God with it, 'tis a frequent Hebraisme: Thus Abraham is called a Prince of God, Gen. 23.6 (i) a mighty Prince, the mountaines of God (i) high and excel|lent mountaines,,  est epi|theton omnis rei admirandae  magnae. Wemsee. . Exod. 3.1. and 4.27. Psal. 46.4. the City of God (i) a glorious City. Psal. 36.6. So Cedars of God (i) tall Cedars, Psal. 80.11. a river of God, Psal. 65.10. wrastlings of God, Gen. 30.5. Harps of God, Rev. 15.2. (i) excellent Harps. Res Dei Hebraeis di|cuntur

eximiae, Deo Opt. Max. dignae. Paraeus. Thus great haile is called Gods haile, El-gabbish. So a strong Lion is called the Lion of God, ariel. 2 Sam. 23.20. Moses is said to be faire to God (i) exceeding faire, Acts 7.20. So Nineveh was great to God (i) very great, Ionah 3.3.
Si videtur fla|gitium jubere, aut beneficenti|am vitare, igu|rata est locutio. Aug.
When the lite|rall sense is a|gainst mode|sty, piety, or good manners, it must be left. Weemse 1 Vol. l. 2. c. 1. p. 232. Aug. de Doct. Christ. l. 3. c. 16.34. When the literall sense is against any commandement of the Law, then the words must not be taken properly; else the Grammaticall and most imme|diate sense, is ever soundest, unlesse some apparent error in doctrine, or mischiefe in manners follow: for when a sense crosseth any truth taught in other Texts of Scripture, 'tis alwaies a false sense; but if it agree with the Originall, the scope of the place, and the analogy of faith, 'tis good. Austins counsell is good, there are foure things (saith he) to be observed in exounding Scripture.

1. Phrasis Scipurae.
2. Circumstiae.
3. Collat orum locorum.
4. Analogia dei.

35. Words of fact, are oft put for

words of speech, as Exod. 13.2. Sanctify the first born (i) command them to be sanctified. Ier. 1.10. I have sent thee to destroy, c. (i) to preach, and thereby to declare, that I the Lord will doe it. Iohn 4.1. Christ is said to baptize (i) he commanded his Disciples to doe it.
36. 'Tis usuall in Scripture, to put the abstract for the concret, to set forth the excellency of a thing.Erit Bracha be|nedictio (i) ita plen per om|nia benedictus, ut videatur esse ipsa benedictio  Lap. Thus God tels Abraham that he shall not only be blessed, sed erit ipsissima benedictio, Gen. 12.2. (i) affluens omni benedictione,  non tam benedictus, qum ipsa benedi|ctio dicitur. So the Sanctum Sanctorum, dicitur ab Hebaeis sanctitas sanctitae|tum (i) eximi sanctum. So Christ is called, 1 Cor. 1.30. not righteous, but Righteousnesse,Rom. 1.25. ve|ritas pro vero cultu, mendaci|um pro falso. Talis Hebrais|mus plerm est significantior, ut scelus pro scelesto, ste quui inium pro cur|pi. Sanctification, c. (i) summus  saptentissimus justificator  sanctificator noster. So 1 Cor. 15.50. and circumcision for the persons cir|cumcised. Rom. 4.9. Phil. 3.3. So abo|mination oft put for abominable, Pro. 3.32. and 11.1. and 15 8.9.
37 The conjunctive particle [And] doth not alwaies ditinguish ivers things, but is oft used by way

of explanation,Conjunctio [] non semper di|versa distin|guit, sed exposi|tivae particulae saep vicem ge|rit perfiguram quam vocant Hendiadis. And is oft taken comparatively, for much more as Psal. 125.2. And the Lord is about his people. q. d. as the Mountaines are about Ierusa+lem [o forifie and dfnd it] so much more is the Lord a|bout his people [to fortifie and defend them] So Amos 1.3. for three transgres|sions, And, (i) much more for a fourth I will punish, c. Sola expresse dicta in proban|do fundamenta|li dogmate ad|mittunt Socinia|ni: Hos refellit doctis. Horne beck contra Socinian. l. 1. c. 9. p. 211, 212. c. as Mat. 3.11. he shall baptise you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire (i) with the Holy Ghost, which shall be like fire to purge out your drosse. Iohn 3.5. except a man be born again of water and the spirit (i) with spirituall water, or the spirit which is like water to cleanse, cool, and refresh us. Spiritum  aquam pro eo|dem posuit, frequens loquendi mos est in Scriptura, cum de spiritu fit mentio, ad exprimendam ejus vim, aquae vel ignis nomen adjungi. Calvin.
38. Where one and the same word is used in divers senses, in divers places of Scripture, the circumstances of the Text, must judge and declare in what sense it is to be taken there.
39. Whatsoever is truly and soundly collected from Scripture (by good con|sequence) is Scripture, as though it were expressely written. e. g. the word Trinity, Sacrament, Thou shalt baptize Infants, are not literally and syllabically in Scripture, yet since by good conse|quence they may be gathered from thence, it is equivalent as if in so many letters they were written there, Mat. 22.32, 33. else disputations, Sermons,

and books consonant to Scripture should not be credited. See this more fully cleared in my Font-Guarded. p 34, 35. and Mr Sidenham against Anabapt. p. 6, 7, c.
40. Contemne not the judgement of those learned, Godly, Orthodox lights which God hath raised up in this latter age of the world, whose names are pre|tious in the Church of God, for their Piety and Fidelity in his work; as Cal|vin, Beza, Bucer, Bullinger, Peter Martyr, Wolphius, Marlorate, Mus|culus, Zanchy, Perkins, Paraeus, Piscator, Rivet, c. many green heads (out of pride and selfe-conceitednesse) con|temne these famous lights, and trust to their own wit, and so run themselves on many rocks: it's good for young men, especially at their first setting forth, to make use of the labors of god|ly and Orthodox Divines; not that I would have any to pin their faith on any mans sleeve, be he never so godly, or learned; onely I would not have men rashly, without good ground and strong reason, to dissent from the common iudgement, and received opinion of those whom the Church of God hath

found faithfull in expounding Scrip|ture.
Amen est vox non jurantis, sed affirm ms  graviter asse|verantis  a+pissime opta is. Adverbioum geminatio vel emphasin, vel distibutionem notat, ut Lev 6.12. man, man, (i) quolibet ma tutino tempore; ita Eze. 13.10.41. When the Scripture affirms a thing earnestly, as being a matter of great concernment, it useth to double the asseveration, as Iohn 1.51. and 3.3, c. no Evangelist but Iohn, useth this double affirmation, and he useth it nine|teen times in his Gospell, this he did the rather to strengthen our beliefe, and to shew how sparing he was of an oath; and for the greater certainety of the thing. As Pharaoh's dream was doubled, to shew the certainty of it, Gen 41.32. In Scripture there is a three|fold Amen. 1. Assenting, Deut. 27.26. and 1 Cor. 14.16. 2. Assuring, Mat. 5.18. 3. Assevering, so here, Amen, when prefixed, is a certaine and earnest asseveration, when affixed at the end of our Prayers, c. it notes our assent and assurance. q. d. Quae ego dic sunt Amen Amen (i) vera vera, hoc est, verissima certissima,  omni alia verita|te veriora, omni alia certitudine certiora.  Lap. in Iohn 3.3.
Suppositio nihil ponit in esse.42. Suppositions in Scripture, are no Positions, when the speech is only Hy|potheticall, it concludes nothing; for a

conditionall proposition doth not sim|ply affirme, and therefore conclusions gathered from it, as if it were affirma|tive, will not hold, e. g. Ezek. 18.24. If a righteous man turne from his righ|teousnesse. Hence the Arminians con|clude, that a righteous man may fall from grace: but 1. This is but a suppo|sition, and so concludes not. 2. The Text doth not speak of Evangelicall righteousnesse, but of a legall, civill, morall righteousnesse, which may bee lost. So Ezek. 14.14 [i] Noah, Iob and Daniel should pray for them, c. it doth not therefore follow, that the Saints departed, doe pray for living Saints. Mat. 11.21, 22. [if] he mighty works which were wrought in thee, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they had repented, c. it doth not therefore follow, that there was some inclinati|on in Tyre and Sidon to repentance, as Luke 19.37. if these should hold their peace, the stones would speak; it will not follow that therefore there was some inclination in the stones to speak.
43. When the Scripture doubles a|ny thing. 1. In denouncing judge|ments,

it notes the certainty,V. Greenhill on Ezek. 5.8. See more fully Il|lyric. de Tropis. p. 28 4. celerity, and frequency of them, as Gen. 2.17. dying thou shalt dye (i) thou shalt sure|ly dye. So Multiplicando multiplicabo (i) vald multipli|cabo dolorem tuum. Gen. 3.16. 2. In promising mercies, it notes reality and earnest|nesse. Isaiah 40.1. Ezek. 37.5, 6. Isaiah 55.1. come, come, come. Hab. 2.3. Hos. 2.19. thrice I will betroth thee: the iteration implies affection, intention, and reality. 3. In prophesies it notes the speedinesse and certainty of them, Gen. 41.32. Exod. 3.7. Heb. 10.37. 4. In Prayer it notes the servency, and ear|nest desire of him that praies.. precibus preca|tus est (i) fer|venter precatus est. Iames 5.17. he prayed in prayer (i) he prayed ear|nestly: many pray, but they doe not pray in prayer, Mat. 7.21. 5. In Narrations and Repetitions, they serve either for confirmation to assure us that the matter is true, and worthy to be noted, or else for explication, the latter clause exegetically expounding the for|mer, as Deut. 11.22. usually it is empha|tically, as Ier. 18.18. come let us devise devises (i) let us be earnest and active to plot Ieremie's ruine. So Iohn 9.4. I must work the works of him that sent me; there is an emphasis in the expres|sion, and it notes Christs strong intenti|on

on the worke of God.So Isa. 6.3. Ier. 22 29. Ita condupli|cat Paulus quaedam ad majorem empha|sin, maxime in gradibus comparationis, idque ut plurimum excessum significet, ut ad Phil. 1.23 mult magis melis (i) long melis;Geminatio Idio|mate Hbaico nomina aliquan|do distribu. Sanctius in Ezek. 14 4: vir. vir. He. (i) quicunque vir.  Lap. So Eccl. 1.2. 6. Sometimes it signifies distribution. 1 Chro. 16. a gate and a gate (i) every gate, and 2 Chro. 19 5. Levit. 17.3. a City and a City (i) every City. Ezek. 14.4. man, man (i) every man. Levit. 18.6. Psal. 122.4. 7. It notes variety or diversity, as Pro. 20.20. a waight and a waight (i) divers waights, an heart and an heart (i) a diverse and a double heart. 8. It notes excellency, as Cant. 1.1. song of songs, God of Gods. Psal. 116.2. King of Kings (i) most high and excellent. 9. An adverbe double, doth increase the deniall, as Mat. 5.20 , yee shall not, not (i) in no wise enter. So Rev. 21.27. and Heb. 13.5. there are five negatives, I will not, no I will not, I will not leave thee nor for|sake thee.


44. Of Scripture Weights and Measures.
Of the Line. 2. Reed. 3. Palm, c. See God|wins Iewish Antiq. l. 6. c. 9.FIrst, there was the common Cubit, from the point of the Elbow to the top of the middle Finger. 2. There was the Cubit of the Sanctuary, which was more then the common Cubit. Deut 3.11. the Cubit of a man was or|dinarily a foot and a halfe, or halfe a yard; this was the common Cubit; but the holy Cubit, or the Cubit of the Sanctuary was a full yard containing two of the common Cubits: by this Moses measured the Tabernacle, and Solomon the Temple. 3. There was a Geometricall Cubit, which contained six common Cubits, and according to these (its thought) that Noahs Arke was built, Gen. 6.15, 16.
2. The Hebrews had measures of capacity, and those were of two sorts.
1. Some were for dry things, as corne, seed c.
2. Some for liquid things, as Wine, Oyle, c.
1. The measures of dry things, were 5 especially.


1. A Kab.
2. An Omer.
3. Modius, a measure.
4. The Ephah.
5. The Homer.

2. The measures of liquid or moist things, were three especially.

1. The Log.
2. The Hin.
3. The Bath.

1. The Kab was the first and the least measure,In aridis fuit, quod Cad erat in liquidis. which the Hebrews had, they used it in the measuring of dry things; 'twas the eighteenth part of an Ephah (say some) the sixth part of a Satum, it conteined the quantity of 24 egge shels; twas equall to our Quart. The famine in Samaria was so great, that a fourth part of a Kab of Doves dung, was sold for five pieces of silver, 2 Kings 6.25. an Asses head (though it could have but little meat on it,Cum Hannibal Casilinum obsi|deret, Mus u|nus vendbatur ducentis denari|is. Val. Max. l. 7. c. 6. yet in that extremity) was sold for ten pounds, (say some) and the fourth part of a Kab of Doves dung, which is conceived to be about a pound and one ounce (i) 13

Reckoning 12 ounces to the pound, and not 16, as wee usually do. ounces, was sold at 12. s. 6. d. This was Gods just judgement on them for their Idolatry and sin, that they who set at naught the word of God, that hea|venly Manna, and most pretious food of the soule, should now be enforced thorough necessity to pay most deae for base things, and at other times con|temptible, and all to satisfie their hun|ger.
2. An Omer was the tenth part of an Ephah, Exo. 16.36. some call it Go|mer, because Y is pronounced by H or G. it contained about three pints and an halfe. 3. Modius a measure, or sa|tum was a Gallon and halfe, we tran|slate the word in generall, a measure, 2 Kig 7.1. to morrow a measure (i) a Satum of fine flower shall be sold for a shekell.
4. The Ephah was the tenth part of an Homer, equall with the [Bath] in liquid things: about an English bushell, it contained three Pecks and ten Go|mers, Levit. 19.36. 1 Sam. 1.24. and 17.17. Isaiah 5.10. Amos 8.5.
5. The Homer as the Talent, was the greatest weight; so the Homer was the greatest measure, it contained (say

some) as much as a Camell could well beare at once: about ten bushels (say others) about five bushels others say. Ezek. 45.11. it contained ten Ephahs (i) 45 Gallons, or 5 Bushels and 5 Gal|lons.
2. The measures of liquid things were, 1. The Log, it was the least measure of liquids, 'twas the twelfth part of an Hin, containing in quantity six egge shels, about halfe a pinte, Levit. 14.10, 12, 15, 21, 24.
2. The Hin contained about three Quarts, Exo. 29.40. and 30.24. Numb. 5.4, 5. Ezek. 4.11.
3. The Bath, the tenth part of an Homer, equall with the Ephah, the same which in Greek is called Hydria, in Latine Cadus; it contained four Gal|lons and an halfe, Ezek. 45.10, 11, 14. Isaiah 4.10.
45. Concerning the Coynes that were among the Hebrews, as the Mite, the Quadrans, the Gerah, Didrach|mum, Stater, Denarius, a Shekell, a Ta|lent, c. Interpreters vary much about them: those that have done best both on Weights and Coines, are  Lapide in the end of the Pentateuch. Weem|se,

1 Vol. in the end p. 129,See more, Wil|kins Ecclesiast. p. 42. ult. Edit. c. Godwin Iewish Antiq l. 6. c. 10. Breerwoods little Tract, de Ponder.  pretiis vet. num|morum cum recntioribus collatione; and above all, our last large and learned An|notations on the whole Bible, are so.
46. The Imperative Mood com|manding, is oft put for the Optative, wishing, as Cant. 1.2. Let him kisse me, for, oh that he would kisse me. So Mat. 6.9, 10. let thy name be hallowed, let thy Kingdome come. q. d. oh that thy name might be hallowed, and thy King|dome come.
Mos est Scriptu|rae, ut optare videatur ma|lum, cum non optet, sed praevi|deat. Aug.47. Many imprecations are not so much Prayers, as Prophesies; foretel|ling what shall be, rather then desiring they should be.
48. There is a singular variety, but no contrariety in the Scriptures; there is a sweet Harmony and consent in them, the Old Testament agreeing with the New,Quae pugnare videntur nostr culp ac igno|ranti talia esse existimantur, q+res non intelligi|mus, velcir|cumstantias non expendimus: Illyricus. Moses with the Pro|phets, and the Apostles with them both, if any place seem to contradict another, the fault lies in our own blindnesse, and not in the Scripture, which is alwaies at peace with it selfe. e. g. Christ is cal|led Davids Lord, Psa. 110.1. and else|where

he is called Davids sonne, Mat. 22.42, 43, 44, 45. The answer is easy, Christ was Davids Lord in respect of his Divinity, and Davids sonne, in re|spect of his humanity. So, as he was God, the Father and he were one; but as he was man, so the Father was grea|ter then he.Christus qui per se  propri est pacis autor; per accidens, roper hominum mali|tiam turbarum est occasio. Cal. Non veni mit|tere pacem (i) terrenam  mundanam; non pacem spiritua|em mentis,  pacem unionis fidelium inter se, ac cum Deo  Angelis eju Christum alla|turum praedixit Isaias 9.6, 7.  65.25.  14.  Lp. Thus Christ and the Gos|pell simply considered in themselves, bring inward peace. Iohn. 14.27. my peace I give you; but accidentally mee|ting with the corruptions of men and the malice of Satan. So Mat. 10.34. I came not to send [outward, worldly] peace, but a sword. Satan and his A|gents being inraged at the publication of the Gospell, will raise up stirres and oppositions against it. Thus Mat. 10 10. a staffe is forbidden the Apostles, yet Marke 6.8, 9. a staffe is allowed them. Ans. We must distinguish of staves 1. There are striking defensive staves, which cumber those that carry them, and are a burthen to them, these are for|bidden. 2. There are itinerary staves, Whereon. Travellers doe ease them|selves, Gen. 32.10. these walking staves Mark means. Duplex tum fuit in usu baculus. sl. defensiorius  portatorius,

itinerarius seu sustentatorius:See most see|ming contra|dictions recon|ciled very sa|tisfactorily, in Sharpius his Symphony. loquunur Evangelistae de defensorio  portatorio qui oneri fuit portantibus: Christus ver apud Marcum, itinerarium  sustenta|torium baculum adjumenti loco permit|tit. Sharpius.
49. Whatsoever is said in Scripture, for the comfort of one, must be applyed by al in the like case and condition.Deus erga simi|les similiter se gerit. That promise which God ade to Ioshua [Ioshua 1.5] is by the Apostle applyed to all the faifull,Quod convenit tali, qua~ talis, connveit omni tali. Heb. 13.5. that pro|mise which belongs to one beleever, as a beleever, belongs to every beleever; what he promiseth to one he promiseth to all that ae in that state: for though some may have moe grace, yet none have more . Look what promise God made to Abraham, David, Paul, c. as believers we  and must apply them as ours for all the promises are our heritage and belong to us, as well as our fore-fathers; to us Gentiles, as well as to the Jewes. Acts 2.39. the promise is to you and to your children, and to such as are afarre off. Rom. 4.16. Ephes. 3.6.
50. Examples may bee followed where there are the like causes. cir|cumstances

and conditions;Vi similes cau|sae  circum|stantiae, ibi lo|cum habet ex|emplum. when the equity of the thing is universall and the cause common; else extraordinary ca|ses will not make an ordinary Rule. e. g. Ehud killed Eglon [Iudg. 3.20, 21.] therefore a Fryar may kill a King. Ans. Non sequitur,Fecit hoc Ehud Dei instinctu, eque hostem potis intere|mit, quam popu|li rectorem ty|rantium.  Lap: for Ehud had a speciall commission from God, to doe what he did, he raised him up to be a deliverer of his people, ver. 15. and therefore this can be no president to any, to murther Princes, though they be Hereticks and Tyrants.Samson (singu|lari inflinctu) direct intende|bat Philistaeos occidere, indire|ct seipsum Ames. So Samsons killing himselfe, is no ground for selfe-murther [Iudg. 16.30.] for what he did, was done by an extraordinary motion, and instinct of Gods spirit, nor did he directly and pri|marily intend his owne destruction, but the ruine of Gods enemies. Elijah by extraordinary calling, called for fire from Heaven, and burnt the Captaines, therefore the Disciples may call for fire from Heaven to burne the Samaritans [Luke 9.55.] this will not follow, be|cause they acted not by the same spirit; Elijah was led by a spirit of zeale, but these by a fiery, furious, rash spirit. Thus the act of Phinehas was extraordinary, Numb. 25.8, 11. Nor will it follow,

because the Apostles anointed the sick with oyle, and cured them [Iam. 5 14.] therefore we may doe so to; for that gift was miraculous and peculiar to those Apostolicall times, and is now ceased; besides, that oyle was ad sana|tionem, for health and recovery; but the Papists is ad viaticum, for a journey, when men are dying and past recove|ry. Thus because in the Apostolicall times, there was an extraordinary gift of Prophesying and interpreting Scrip|ture by Revelation without any study, it doth not follow that therefore the same gift abides still, and All may Pro|phesie.
E si [donec] a|liquando termi|num significat, tamen plem|que infinitum tempus signifi|cat. Paraeus.51. The word [untill] in Scripture, is oft taken for never; it importeth not alwaies, any definite space of time, but signifieth an infinite time, or to eternity. Thus Mat. 1.25. untill shee had brought forth, c. (i) never. So Mat. 5.26. until thou hast paid the utmost arthing (i) never. So Gen. 8.7. and 28.15. 1 Sam. 15.35. and 2 Sam. 6.23. Psal. 110.1. Mat. 28.20. 1 Cor. 15.25.
52. The word [none] is oft put for few, as Ier. 8.6. no man repented (i) none comparatively, they were very

few. So 1 Cor. 2.8. none of the Princes of this world (i) few, Isaiah 64.7.
53. The Present Tense being put for the Future Tense, doth signifie the certainty of a thing, as Isaiah 21.9. Rev. 18.2.Anadiplosis pro|plc, pro ca|det,  est ce, brevi, pe|nius. Pareus. So Jude 14 the Lord commeth (i) he will as surely come, as if he were now comming. Babylon the great fallen, is falled (i) it shall as certainly fall, as if it were already done, the doubling of it also implies the greatnesse, neetnesse, and certainty of it downfall. Cecidit significat actum instantem  quasi in|chantem. 2. cecidit (i) jm cadere inci|pit, ac brevi prono casu cdet Babylon.  Lapids.
54. The word [Rather] is not al|waies put comparatively, when two persons or things are compared, as like and unlike: but sometimes nega|tively, as a denying particle,Impropria est comparatio, ne|que enim quasi  ambo|bus sit justitia, publicanum Christus gradie tant aliquo praesert, sed in|telligit cum su|isse gratm Deo: quum Pharisae|us in totum re|jectus fuerit. Calvin. instead of [not] as Luke 18.14. this man went away, [rather] justified then the other. q.d. not the other, but he went away ju|stified; for the Pharisee was not at all justified, Mat. 5.0. neither is there more or lesse in justification; but our Saviour here useth a popular kind of expression. So Iohn 3.19. men loved darknesse [rather] then light. q.d. they loved not light, but darknesse.
Propositio inde|finita aequipol|let universal. Keckerm.55. An indefinite speech in Scrip|ture, is equivalent to an universall, as Iob 14.1. Man that is born of a woman (i) every man. So Pro. 28.14. blessed is [the man] that fears alwaies (i) blessed is [every man] that truely fears God. So he that beleeves shall be saved (i) who|soever he be. So, blessed are they that mourn, c. (i) all they inclusively, and onely they exclusively, c. The Scrip|ture abounds in such kind of speeches.
56. The Scripture oft puts a thing in the Participle of the Present Tense, to note a continued act.Fuit aedificans. Montanus. Thus Cain is said to be building [Gen. 4.17.] to denote his earthly affection, and that he made it, as 'twere, his onely work to build Cities; he did not onely build, but hee was [building] as if hee meant to live here for ever. Thus to encourage us to pray,Audins oratio|nem. Mont. 'tis Gods prerogative Royall to be a God [Hearing] Prayer, Psal. 65.2. he not once or twice heareth, but is continually [hearing] he makes it (as I may say) his great work to be still hea|ring, observing, and answering the Prayers of his people. So Pro. 13.20. he that walketh [ambulans Heb.] with wise men shall be wiser (i) he who is

continually amongst them, and trades (as 'twere) with them, shall in time learn wisdome from them. So Mat. 24.38. the sin of the old word is thus described, they were eating, drinking, marrying; not that 'tis a sinne in it self, to eat, drink, marry; but when men eat and drink excessively, so much the Par|ticiples imply Significat bru|torum instar fo|rs ventri dedi|tos. Beza. Edere  bibere non est pecca|tum, his ver ne|gotiis immori, vel deditum esse cum Dei con|temptu, scelus exitiosum est. Pareus.  (i) edentes, like brute Beasts, they did not onely eat, but they were alwaies eating, it was their Trade and work; they passed without intermission from eating to drinking, from drinking to marrying, c. they followed it close, as if it had been their onely work, and they born for no other end. So 1 Tim. 5.17. Ministers must be , laborantes; still labouring for God, and spending themselves in his service. So Ephes. 5.20. , gratias agentes, we must not give thanks for a day or two but alwaies, on all oc|casions we must be giving thanks.
57. The Scripture sometimes de|nounceth judgements, and promiseth blessings to the Parents, which yet were fulfilled to their children onely. Thus Noah cursing Has. Gen. 9.25, 26. a servant of servants shall he bee to his

Brethren, c. this was fulfilled in his posterity, the Canaanites, who served the Israelites under the conduct of Ioshua. God promised the Land of Ca|naan to Abraham,Canaan datur Abrahamo in praesentia, de jure: Posteris ver possssione. Parcus. Gen 13.15. yet not hee, but his posterity enjoyed it foure hundred years after, in Ioshua's time. Thus Isaack said to Iacob, Gen. 27.29. be Lord over thy Brethren, and let thy mothers sonnes bow downe to thee. This was not fulfilled in Esau, who in|stead of serving, did rather Lord it over Iacob, but this Prophesie was fulfilled in Esau's posterity, when the Idumaeans and Moabites were brought under the subjection of David. So Gen. 49 7. I wil divide them in Iacob, c. where by Ia|cob and Israel, is not meant the person, but the posterity of Iacob or Israel.

16. Rules to direct us in the right ex|pounding of the Law.
THE knowledge of the Law in its utmost extent and spirituality, is very necessary for every Christian. Wee are all by nature, Pharisees, and have high conceits of our selves; and though many will confesse themselves to be sinnes in grosse,Psal. 119.96. Gods Law is exceeding broad, and reacheth fur|ther then du|ties or vice expresly there named. Blake on the Cove|nant. p. 19. yet descend to parti|culars, and then I have had many that could keep all the Commandements: Now when such shall be made to see the spirituall nature of the Law, and how it condemnes, not onely the gross act, but also the secret corruption of our hearts; heart-murther, heart-pride,

heart-theft, heart-adultery, c. they wil us, humble make us poor in spirit, sensi|ble of our own impotency, and inability to any goodnesse; when in this glass we shall see the numberlesse number of our sins, and those Seas of wrath due unto us for them; this wil make us fly to Christ, as to our City of refuge, and prize a Sa|viour above all the Kingdomes of the world, c.
2. As the Law is a glasse for dete|ction, so 'tis a Rule for direction, by which all beleevers must frame their lives, serving him who hath redeemed them, in Righteousnesse and Holinesse all their dayes: and therefore it's very necessary for all Gods people, to know what vices are forbidden, that they may shun them; and what duties he enjoines us, that we may practise them. To this end I have taken some paines to collect all the Rules (which in my little reading I have met with) that give any light into the Commande|ments, that having a compendium of them at hand we might have recourse to them on all occasions: as for the par|ticular opening of every commande|ment, I shall refer the Reader to Mr

Brinslyes Watch, Mr Whately, and Dr Downhams Expositions of the Com|mandements.
1 Rule. Every Precept of the Morall Law, is both Affirmative and Negative, 'tis not sufficient that we fly evill, but we must doe good, Psal. 34.14. Mat. 3.10. and 25 42. Isaiah 1.16, 17. for every Commandement hath two parts, the first, Affirmative, commanding a duty, the neglect whereof is called a sin of Omission. 2. The Negative, forbid|ding vice, the doing whereof, is called a sin of Commission.
2. Under the Negative, the Affirma|tive is alwaies comprehended: when a sinne is forbidden,Omnia praecep|ta synecdochi|c  concepta sunt, ideque ex vitiorum inter|dictis contraria virtutum man|data sunt intel|lgenda. Tilen. the contrary Grace is commanded; he that saies we shall not kill, commands us also to preserve the life of our Neighbour. Occidisti si non fovisti. Aug. Qui prohibet impe|dimentum praecipit adjumentum.
3. When a sinne is forbidden in any Commandement under it, (by a synec|doche) all the sins of the same kind,A principaliori crimine caetera quque minora e assia intel|lige.  Lap. are forbidden also. e. g. under adultery is condemned fornication, incest, apes, Sodomy, c. Under murder, is forbid|den malice, rah anger, ighting, c.

with all kind of murther,Mmento plus esse semper in praeceptis ac in|terdicts quam verbis xrimi|tur. mentall, ver|ball, reall, 1 Iohn. 3.13. and thus Christ himselfe expounds the Law, Mat. 5.21, 22. and the reason why God puts the name of the great sinne upon the lesser, is to make us see the hainous nature of it to hate a man, or give way to rash an|ger, any think it a small matter; but when the Lord tels us it is murther, then wee see the greatnesse of it: Thus Rebellion is called Witchcraft, 1 Sam. 15.23.
4. Every Precept is spirituall, Rom. 7.14. the Law is spirituall.In omnibus mandatis am interna quam externa  paecpr. Mans Law binds the hands and tongue; but Gods Law binds the heart and soule, Iohn 4.24 it requires not onely outward obe|dience in words and works, but also inward in the heart and mind; God sees, and punisheth as well for inward sins, as for outward, Mat. 5, 28. it takes notice of heart-adultery; and herein this Royall, excellent Law of God [Iam. 2.28.] excels all humane Lawes. 1. Mens awes take no notice of every small offence,De minutis nn cua lex. Reg. Iuris. but Gods Law obser|veth and condemneth even the least sins, even Gnats as well as Camels; the Nazarite must not only forbeare the

wine, but he must not so much as eate the kernell of the Raisin [Numb. 6.4] nor the huske. 2. Mens Lawes take no notice of thoughts,Cogitationis poe|nam in nostro oo nemo luat. uriscons.
Praeceptum ul|timum per supe|riora omnia de|ducendum, ut intelligatur non exterires tan|tum actus, sed interiores etiam prvos motus in illis, prohiberi. Gehard.
Ia Sabbahum externo ore  interna devoti|one sanctifican|dum prohibet Deus non exter|nam tanm opus homicidii, suti, adulterii, sed internas eti|am cogitationes occidendi, c. Wendel.
Quando man|dtur aliquid, mandatur  omne per quod pervenitur ad illud. Regula. they cannot pu|nish for them; but Gods Law reacheth the heart, and binds the most secret co|gitations. Gen. 6.5. God takes notice of the evill of the imaginations and thoughts of our heart, he sees our wrath, and observes our very countenance. Gen. 4 6. why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance falle? and the ga|shing of the teeth. Acts 7 54. making mouths, Isaiah 57.4. pointing with the finger, Isaiah 58.9. those small things which men think nothing, yet Gods Law condemnes.
5. The Law is perfect, requiring perfect obedience, both inward and outward, both of parts and degrees: therefore when any duty is comman|ded, there the highest degree of it is commanded, Mat. 22.37, 38. and where a vice is forbidden, there the least de|gree of it is forbidden, and beares the name of a grosse sin, that we might esteem no sin small.
6. When a duty is commanded, the meanes to attain it are commanded

also, and when a vice is forbidden, the allurements thereto are forbidden e. g. when the Lord commands us to wor|ship him alone, this includes Praying, Reading, Hearing the word, watching over our hearts and wayes, and frequen|ting good company; hence David bids the wicked depart, that so he might keep the Commandements of the Lord, Psal. 119.115.
7. Where any virtue is commanded, a vice forbidden, there also the signes are commanded and forbidden, as well as the things themselves. e. g. hee that commands us to be gracious, commands us also to shew forth the fruits of him that hath called us, and that our light should shine before men, and our mo|deration be known to all, c. 2. For vices, we must not only shun the sinne, but the shews also and appearances of sinneQuando aliquid prohibetur, prohibetur  illud per quod prvenitur ad illud. Reg. Iu|riscons. 1 Thes. 5.22. Iude 23. lofty looks and strange apparell, c. which are signes of pride, must be avoided. Isaiah 3.16. Zeph. 1.8. 1 Tim. 2.9. wee must shun lewd company, suspected places, lewd speeches, and all the signes of in|continency: wee must not onely abhor the Devils Beefe, but his Broth too.

Isaiah 65.4. Iacob must bury the ear|rings, lest they make an Idol. Gen. 35.4. The men of Ephesus repenting, burne their books of Sorcery: the Lord con|demnes the dregs of sinne, as well as the sinne it selfe he that saies we shall not kill, saies also we shall not revenge, no nor once remember the wrong. Le. 19.18.
8. All men are bound to a religious observation of Gods Commandements, none are exempted, God hath not made one commandement for the rich, and another for the poor; but high and low, rich and poor, Jew and Gentile, bond and free, of what Nation Sex or condi|tion soever they be, they must observe Gods righteous commands;Futuro utuntur Hebraei pro im|perativo. Non occides (i) ne oc|cidito, c. as God is Lord of all the world, so he expects obe|dience to his commands, from all. Hence the Commandements are pub|lished in the second person singular [Thou] speaking particularly to all, c. thou Lord, thou beggar, c.
9. The Law must not onely be ob|served,Lex non solm observanda, sed etiam conser|vanda. but also preserved by us. e. g. 'tis not sufficient that the Master keep the Sabbath himselfe, but he is bound to see that all his family observe it also;  so in

every other Commandement; 'tis not, sufficient that I doe not kill, but I must doe what in me lies, to preserve others from killing. We must therefore in our places and callings, by instruction, di|rection, correction, c. labour to pre|vent sin, in all about us, else we may be|come accessaries to other mens sins, and that seven waies.

1. Mandando.
2. Commndado.
3. Permitendo.
4. Provocado.
5. Consentiendo.
6. Difendendo.
7. Consociando.

1. Mandando, by commanding and giving direction. David did not kill Uriah with his own hands, but giving directions to Ioab,Quod quis per alium fcit, id per se facre vi|detur. Reg. |ris. and writing to him how it should be done, 'twas his murther. 2 Sam. 11.15. Saul killed the Priest,e patratis s|leribus glari, patrantibus ab|blandri, id de ploraae est im|probitats. Parcus. in commanding Doeg to doe it, 1 Kings 21.10.
2. Laudando, by commending men for their pride, drunkennesse and pro|fanenesse; 'tis in a manner all one, to

commit a sin, and to commend it. Ro. 1.32. nihil interest favesne sceleri an illud facias. Seneca.
3. Permittendo, by conniving at the sins of others, and not restraining them when it is in their power.Qui non vetat peccare, cum possit, jubet. Thus Eli be|came accessary to the sinne of his sons, 1 Sam. 3.13. and Pilate to Christs death, Iohn 19.16. and Ahab is said to kill, when he suffered Letters to be written in his name, to have Naboth killed. 1 King. 21.19.
4. Provocando, by incitation, stirring men up, and provoking them to doe wickedly. Thus did Iobs wife, Iob. 2.9. and Iesabel, 1 King. 21.25. a sinne for|bidden, Gal. 5.26.
5. Consentiendo, by consenting. Thus Saul was accessary to Stevens death, Acts 7.58. and 8.1. The Hypocrite consents with Theeves, and partakes with Adulterers, Psal. 50.18.
6. Defendendo, by justifying the wic|ked, and condemning the just, Pro. 17.15. calling evill good, Isaiah. 5.20.
7. Consociando, by being familiar with men in their sin. God hath ordei|ned our non-communion and with|drawing of our selves from them to be a

meanes of their reclaiming. 2 Thes. 3.14. have no company with such, Rom. 16.17. 2 Iohn 10. 1 Cor. 5.9.
Obligant semper  ad semper, in omni loco  tempore.10. The Negative Commande|ments bind most strongly, they bind us alwaies, and to all times, 'tis unlawfull at any time to sin, I may never blas|pheme, curse,Affimativa non obligant ad semper licet semper spectan|da sunt pro loco, sed pro tempore varias accipiunt limi|tationes  in|terpretationes. lye, c. In the Negative, the acts of vice are alwaies forbidden, but in the Affirmative, the acts of virtue are commanded, with due consideration of circumstances; for al|though they bind us alwaies, yet they bind us not to all times; we must admo|nish our brother, read, pray, hear, give almes, c. yet are we not bound to these at all times: hence all the Commande|ments almost, are Negative. 1. Be|cause Negative Commandements bind more strongly. 2. They worke on our minds, and more then Affirmative ones, 3. Because our nature is exceeding prone to evil. 4. This is the true order of repentance, first to cease from evill, and then to doe good.
11. We must apply the curse parti|cularly, to the breach of every comman|dement; if wee have profaned the Sab|bath, taken Gods Name in vain, c. the

curse is due to every one of these sins, Deu. 27.ul. Gal. 3.10.  so the blessings, though they be not particularly expres|sed, yet must be applyed by every one that yields sincer obedience to the Law.
12. Remember, that the first and last condemne the very motions of the heart, against God, or our Neighbour, though wee never yield consent unto them: this humbled Paul so exceeding|ly, Rom. 7.
13. Sins against the first Table, are greater then sins against the second (cae|teris paribus) comparing thoughts with thoughts, words with words,  works, the comparison must be equall, as blas|phemy, and the highest degree of sinne against God, is greater then theft, or murther: but if the comparison be not equall, it will not hold, for Adultery is a greater sin, then the least breach of the Sabbath; and murther is a greater sinne then the least abuse of Gods Name.
14. The second Table must give place to the first;Obedientia pri|mae tabulae de|rogat secundae, quando utrque simul locum ha|bere nequit. ut Luc. 14.16. Gerhard. hence Mat. 22.38. Christ cals it the first in order and Na|ture, because the love of our Neighbour flowes from the love of God. 2. The great Commandement in excellency

and dignity, because it more immediate|ly commands things concerning God. Our Neighbour must be loved but onely in and for the Lord, so far as may stand with his glory: 'tis no dishonour to our Fathers on earth, to see their heavenly Father served before them, Ephes. 6.1. Acts 4.19. and 5.29.Lex ceremonia|lis cedit moali. Reg. This Rule holds in Morals, but not in Ceremonials, for God would rather have a Ceremony omit|ted, then our Neighbours safety endan|gered, Hos. 6.6. Mat. 12.3, 4, to chap. 15.3, 4.
15. We must obey Gods commands, purely for the commands sake, many will seem to observe them for self-ends, to merit, get praise, c. but we must have respect to them all, simply, because our God commands them.
16. Precepts presuppose faith e.g. Doe this, and thou shalt live (i) doe it in Christ. So Eccl. 12.13. Keep the com|mandements (i) in Christ or by faith in him. So, thou shalt love the Lord, with all thy heart (i) Evangelically.
17. God who made the Law, can dispense with his owne Law in things that touch not upon his nature, justice, purity, c. God cannot sinne, because

purity is naturall to him, he cannot lye, because truth is essentially and intrinsi|cally in him; but for things which are out of him, and belong to his soveraign|ty, he is an absolute Lord, he is Lord of dayes, and Lord of goods and life; here he may dispense, and command Abra|ham to sacrifice Isaack, and the Israe|lites to spoyle the Egyptians, Exod. 3.22. and Solomon to make Pictures and Cherubins (which wee may not) For, 1. He had Gods expresse command to make them. 2. They were Types of Christ, they foreshewed his glory, whom the Angels worship. 3. They were placed in the holy of holies, where the people could not see them, much lesse worship them.

To the Christian Reader.
_SInce the Sacred Scrip|ture abounds with Tropes and Figures of all sorts, and is like a pleasant Garden bedeckt with flowers, or a rich Garment beset with Pearles, or a fruitfull field, full of precious Treasures; I con|ceived it might bee time well spent, to dig into those Sacred Minerals, for the better fin|ding out of those Metaphors, Metonymies, Synecdoches, c. which lye hid there: for the bare reading of the Scriptures, with|out

searching into its heavenly mysteries and meaning, is like the comming into a Treasury, wherein wee see many costly things folded up, and some ends appearing out, but when they bee all uncovered, then doth their glory more affect us for the pre|sent, and leave in us a deep im|pression of their excellency. Be|sides, the ignorance of Rheto|rick is one ground of many er|rours amongst us, as will appear in the opening of the Tropes, where you have not onely bare instances, but many Texts clea|red and expounded, c. If it may any way bee serviceable to thee, give God the glory, and let the weak instrument have thy Prayers.





_ANadiplsis, when a word that is used in the end of one sen|tence, is repeated in the beginning of the next, as Psal. 122.2, 3. our feet shall stand in thy gates O Ie|rusalem, Ierusalem is builded, c. So v. 5. there are the thrones of judgement, the thrones of, c. Psa. 145.18. the Lord is nigh to al that cal upon him,See more fully Glassius his Philologia, Edit. 3. p. 1423. to al that call upon him in truth. So Deut. 8.7. the Lord bringeth thee into a good Land, a Land of brooks. So Isaiah 30.9. Ieremy 2.13. and 12.11. Luke 7.31, 32.
Anaphora, when the same word is repeated in the beginning of sentences, as Psal. 29.3. to 10. the voice of the Lord is upon the waters, the voice of the Lord, c. So Psal. 27.1. and 118.2, 3, 4. and 124.1, 2. and 148.1, 2, 3, 4, and

10 1, 2, 3, 4 5. So Ier. 50.35, 36, 37. a sword is upon the Caldeans, a sword is upon the lyars. Ier. 51.21, 22, 23. Ezek. 27.12, 15, 16, 17, 18. Rom. 1.21, 22, 23. thou, thou, thou, 2 Cor. 11.20 and 1 Cor. 1.20. Phil 4.8. Amos 1.3 6, 9.
Antimetabole, is an inversion or change of words, as 1 Cor. 11.8. Man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. So 2 Cor. 12.14. children ought not to lay up for their parents, but Parents for their children.
Antitheton, is the illustration of a thing by its opposite, as Isaiah 5.47. I looked for grapes, and behold wild grapes, for judgement, and behold op|pression; we looked for light, but be|hold obscurity; for brightnesse, but wee walke in darknesse.
More umano Deus in seritu|ris ad homins loquitur. Aug. Asfctus i|bunur Den seem dum s|ctus.Anthropopathia, is a figure very fre|quent in Scripture, as when it speaks of God after the manner of men, and by bodily things sets forth his divine ex|cellencies. Thus passions, as Joy, An|ger, griefe, c. are attributed to God. Thus he is said to have eyes, signifying his omniscience, a hand, signifying his power, wings, to shew his care and protection of his people, nostrils, noting his indignation c.
Arsipesis,Plena effect reticentia. Bucer. See Glossius. p. 1437. when out of an holy an|ger or vehemency, wee cut off some word or part of a sentence, which yet is understood, as Psal. 6 3. but thou O Lord, how long? q. d. how long wil thou delay to send me help and soccour. So Luke 19.42 O if thou hadst known! q d. how happy had it been for thee, if thou hadst known. So 1 Kn 21.7. dost thou now governe the Kingdome of IsraelArise. q.d. art not thou a King? then mayest thou doe what pleaeth thy selfe, therefore arise speedily and bee doing. Remember this was the counsell of a Iesabel. So Psal 95.11. and Heb. 311. to whom I sware in my wrath Si, apud He|braeos st nota jurantis, ut 1 Sam. 1445. if they enter into my rest q.d. they shall never enter into my rest, if they come there, let me not be God, or let me not be true. So Psal. 89 35. So 2 Cor. 12 6. I will say the truthut now I forbeare. So Vera abrup|ta ad sestinatio|nem re notan|m,  ad re|pdaionem m|dam. Paus. Hosea 8 1. Trum|pet to mouth. Heb q.d. et the trumpet to thy mouth, as an Eagle. Heb q.d. the enemy shall fly swifly, as an Ea|gle, Isaiah 1.13. I cannot bear your sinne. Vehemen issimam indignationem repraesentat.
Apostrope, is the turning of a speech

from one person to another, many times abruptly. Thus Psal. 2.9. the Prophet sets forth Gods judgements against the enemies of Christ: then ver. 10. he presently turnes his speech to the great ones: Bee wise now therefore, O yee Kings. So Isaiah 1.2. the Prophet fin|ding the people to be rebellious, turns his speech to the inanimate creatures, Heare O yee Heavens, and harken O earth. So Gen. 49.18. Iudg. 5.21, Psal. 109.21.
Asyndeton, or Dialyton, hath no co|pulative, as 1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 6. charity suf|fereth long, charity envyeth not, c. So 1 Thes. 5.16. to 22. Rom. 3.11. to 16. Psal 66.1 2, 3 Rom. 1.29. 2 Tim. 3.2.
Catachrsis, an improper kind of speech, as Exod. 20.22. yee have Quasi sensu percepistis. seen that I have talked with you (i) ye have heard the Lord speak. So Exod. 23.19. thou shalt not seeth a Kid in her Mo|thers milk, mother is not so proper a terme with us, for a dumbe creature. So Isaiah 64.1. O that thou wouldest end the Heavens and come downe! Hee speaks of God after the manner of men: if a man were in Heaven, and should descend, he having a body, which is a

grosse substance, must needs divide and rend the Heavens, but God being a most pure spirit, passeth through all things, with out any dviding or rending; yet is there in these divine condescentions of speech, a singular excellency; the Lord in his goodnesse, considering our weaknesse, doth even stammer with us, the better to instruct us. Thus Teachers are said to have a voice, Psal 6.8. and 39.12. the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.
Climax, or gradation is frequent in Scripture, when the succeeding clauses transcend each other, as Mat. 7.7, 8. Aske, Seek, Knock; tis not a simple re|petition, but a gradation. So Rom. 5.3, 4, 5. Tribulation worketh patience, pati|tience, experience; and experience hope. So Rom. 8.30. Whom he did pre|destinate, them he also called; whom he called, them he justified, and whom he justified, them he glorified. So Hos. 2. 21, 22. I will heare the Heavens, and they shall heare the earth, c. So Rom. 10.14, 15. How shall they call on him, on whom they have not beleeved? and how shall they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard? and how shal they

heare without a Preacher, c. So Iam. 1.2, 3, 4. Temptations prove us, probati|on brings forth patience, and patience help on towards perfection. So 2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7. add to your faith, vertue and to virtue, knowledge; and to know|ledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience, c. So Iudges 5.30. A work of divers colours is excellent. 2. A work of divers colours of the Needle, is more. 3. Wrought on both sides, that's most of all. So 1 Cor. 11.3. The head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. So Iohn 1.1, 2, 3 4, 5.
Ellipsis, the defect or wanting of a word, as Exod 4.25. Zpporah took a sharpe [stone or knife] is understood. So Isaiah 1.13. I cannot iniquity (i) I cannot beare iniquity. So Hos. 8.1. [see before, Aposiosis.]
Enallage or Heteresis is, 1. Of the Gen|der, soetime the Feminine Gender is put for the Masculine, thus effeminate men are called women, Isaiah 3.12. 2. Of the person, thus one person is oft put for another, as the second for the third, and the third for the first. 3. Of the number, thus the singular number

is oft put for the plurall, and so on the contrary.
Epanalepsis, when the same word is put in the beginning, and the ending of a sentence, as Phil. 4.4. Rejoice in the Lord alwaies, and againe I say, Rejoice. So Psal. 8.1, 9. and 46.1. ult. the same sentence is put in the beginning and ending of the Psalme. So 1 Cor. 3.21, 22. All things are yours, whether things present, or things to come, All is yours. So Rom. 15.4. whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning. So 1 Cor. 14.15. I will pray with the Spirit, and with the Under|standing also. I will sing with the Spirit, and with the Understanding also. 2 Cor. 4.3. If our Gospell be hid, to them that perish it is hid. So it runs in the Origi|nall.
Epanodos, when the same word is repeated in the beginning and middle; or in the middle  end, as Psal. 114.3, 4, 5, 6. Ezek. 32.16. this is the lamenta|tion, where with they shall lament her, the daughters of the Nations shall la|ment her, they shall lament for her, c. Iohn 8.47. He that is of God, heareth Gods word, yee therefore heare them

not, because yee are not of God, Rom. 7.19. the good that I would, I doe not; but the evill that I would not, that I do, Gal. 2.20. I live, yet not I, but Christ li|veth in me, and the life which I now live, I live by faith. So 2 Cor. 2.10, 15, 16.
Epanoriksis, or correction, is the re|inforcement of the clause last uttered, by the subsequent. So Gal. 3.4. and 2.20, have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vaine. So Luke 11.27. When the woman cryed, blessed is the wombe that bare thee, Christ con|verts he. verse 8. yea rather blessed are they that heare the word of God, and do it.Corretio, q.d. quid dico susci|tabit? imo am constitutus est,  in regno ver|satur. Iunius. Commiserationis erg. So 1 Kings 14.14. the Lord shall raise up a King, who shall cut off the house of Ieroboam that day; but what, even now? So Rom. 8.34. and 1 Cor. 15.10. I have laboured more abundantly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was in me.
Epistrophe, when there is the like en|ding in sentences, as Psa. 136. per totum. for his mercie endures for ever. Ezek. 33.25, 26. and shall yee possesse the Land? yee stand upon your sword, c. and shall yee possesse the Land? So Ioel 2.26, 27. and my people shall never be asha|med,

and yee shall eat in plenty, c. and my people shall never be ashamed. So Amos 4.6, 8, 9, 10, 11. yet have yee not returned to me saith the Lord, c. So Haggai 2.8, 9. and 1 Cor. 13.11. when I was a child, I spake as a child, I under|stood as a child, I thought as a child. So a Cor. 11.22. are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I.
Epizeuxis, when the same word is doubled by way of emphasis, as Isaiah 40.1. comfort yee, comfort yee my peo|ple. Isaiah 51.12. I, even I am he that comforts you. Isaiah 38.19. the living the living, he shall praise thee. Mat. 23.37. O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, which killest the Prophets. The name is doubled, to expresse the great affection of the spea|ker So 2 Sa. 18.33.Commisera|tionis erg, c. O my son Absalom, my son, my son, c. Thus Deborah quickens her selfe. Iudg. 5.12. awake, awake, Deborah, c. So Isaiah 51.9. and Ezek. 21.9.27. I will overturne, overturne, overturn it (i) I will certain|ly overturn it.
And this is done sometimes by way of amplification, as Psal. 145.18. the Lord is nigh to all that call upon him, even to all that call upon

him in truth. So Psal. 68.13. the Kings of Armies do fly, do fly [fugiunt, fugiu~] q.d. they fled amain. o Ioel 3.14. multi|tudes, multitudes (i) great multitudes.
3. By way of transition, as Hosea 2.21. I will heare the Heavens, and the Heavens shall heare the Earth, and the Earth shall heare the Corn, c.
Ephenismus, is a fair kind of speech, as Gen. 4.1. Adam knew Eve. See the like moest expression, Numb. 31.17. Mat. 1.25. Luke 1.34. Thus Incest and Aduery is sometimes exprest by a mo|dest terme of uncovering the naked|nesse. Levit. 18.6. and 20.11, 17. Ezek. 22.10. Tus to sanctify, is put for to de|file. Dut. 22.9. So an Harlot is called Kedesuh, a holy woman. Gen. 38.21. by a contrary meaning, as being most unho|ly and uncleane. Thus words sometimes have contrary significations,See more Rule 23. as Barac signifies to blesse or curse. Chesed signi|fies piety or impiety, Levit. 20.17. but Psal. 106.1. it signifies goodnesse.
Exclamatio is that whereby we ex|presse our affection. It is sometimes used per modum optationis, when wee ear|nestly desire a thing, as 1 Chro. 11.17. Oh that one would give me of the water of

the Well of Bethleem! Isaiah 64.1. O that thou wouldt rend the Heavens, and come down! Psal. 84.1.
2. Per modum admirationis, by way of admiration, as Rom. 11.33. O the depth of the riches, both of the wise|dome and knowledge of God!
3. Per modum objurgationis, by way of reproof, as Gal. 3.1. O foolish Gala|thians, who hath bewitched you? So Acts 7 51, 52.
4. Per modum Dolentis, by way of lamentation, Rom. 7.24. Oh wretched man that I am, c.
Exegesis, it is usuall with the Scrip|ture, having said a thing in one member of a sentence,Hc Schema Ec|clesiastae fre|quenter usu erit, quoties res poscit affectum nsi enim ie|rs quod do|cere vis, prae|tervolat oratio nec acules in animis audien|tium relinquit. Dressr. to repeat the same againe, by way of explication or confirmation in the later part as Psal 6.8 9. and 33. 10. 2 Kings 20.3. Remember O Lord, how I have walked before thee, in truth; what's that? an with a perfect heart, and have done that which is right in thy sight. So Isaiah 3.4, 9. and 14.13, 14. Iohn 1.3. Rom. 11.7 8. God hath given them the spirit of slumber, what's that? eyes that they should not see, and eares that they should not hear. So 2 Tim. 3.1. he tels us in generall, that

the last dayes shall be perillous, then verse 2, 3, 4, 5. he tels what particular vices should raign, and make the times so perillous. Yea, such is the goodnesse of God to his people, that when the Scripture hath spoken any thing dark|ly, it useth oft times to join some plain thing to give light to it, as Isaiah 51.1. what is somewhat dark in that verse, is presently explained in the second. So Deut. 7.3. they must not match with Idolaters, why so? v. 4 6. First, because by this meanes, they will draw you to worship their gods. 2. This will pro|voke God to anger. 3. You are an holy people, sequestred for Gods speciall ser|vice, c. Thus oft, not alwaies, we have the sense at hand: yet sometimes wee must search and goe farther off to finde out the sense of some places, which wee read.
Hendyadys, when one thing is divi|ded into two, as Mat. 4.16. in the regi|on and shadow of death, for, the shady region of death. So Mat. 20.20. Wor|shipping and desiring (i) desiring by worshipping.
Hypallage, when the order of the words is changed, as Iob 17.4. thou hast

hid their heart from understanding (i) thou hast hid understanding from their heart.Dominum prae|sepis (i) cognovit Dominum in praesepio se a|lentem.  Lap. So Isaiah 1.3. the Asse knowes his Masters crib, or, he knowes the Ma|ster who feeds him in his crib. So Heb. 3.13. through the deceitfulnesse of sin (i) by deceitfull sin.
Hysterologia, or Hysteron-Proteron, is a placing of that before,Crebr Hystero|logi utitur Ie|remia. which should be after, and somethings after, which should bee before. The Pen men of Scripture, doe not alwaies observe the just order of things, but the truth of the History; they set them down, in that order, in which they came to their minds, and not in that order, which they fell out in. Psal 7.14. he travelleth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischiefe. Here the birth is set before the concep|tion. [See more in Rule 27]
Hyperbole, is two-fold. 1 Vel Epitasis () intentio, cum verbi vires intenditur. Auxsis, when we increase the signification of a speech. So Gen. 29.31. Iacob is said to hate Leah, when he only neglected her, and loved her lesse. So Mat. 10.37. compared with Luke 14.26. and Iohn 12.25. We must not simply hate father, mother, life, c. but comparatively, when they come in competition with

Christ. So Pro. 13.24. he that spares the rod, hates his son (i) he doth not truly love him, that lets him goe astray to his own destruction, and so acts the part of one that hates him. Thus Gen. 13.16. A|brahams seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and starres of Heaven (i) his po|sterity shall be very many. So Psal. 51.7. whiter then snow. Lam. 4.7. whiter then milke, more ruddy then Rubies. So 2 Sam. 1.23. swifter then Eagles, stron|ger then Lyons. 2 Sam. 2.18. swift as a Roe. Isaiah 49.2. I have laboured in vaine yet not altogether in vain, though for little good. So Gen. 11.4. and 13.10. Isaiah 7.15, 25. Ioel. 3.18. the hils shall flow with milk, and the mountaines with wine. So Canaan was stiled a Land flowing with milk and honey, Numb. 13.27, 32, 33. Cities fenced up to Hea|ven, Deut. 9.1. So Psal. 107.26. they mount up to Heaven, and goe downe to the depths (i) they are sorely tossed up and downe. Gal. 4 15. ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them me; 'tis a proverbial speech, q.d. you would have parted with your dearest things, to have done me good. Iohn 21.25. the whole world would

not containe the books (i) they would be very many. Iohn 12.19. the whole world goeth after him (i) many follow him. Luke 18.1. Pray T semper, idem est quod sedul perseve|ranter, assidu.  Lap. alwaies (i) bee constant and persevere in the duty. Mat. 6.3. Acts 2.5. Mat. 19.24. it's ea|sier for a Camell to go through the eye of a needle. [See more, Rule 19.]
2. Mesis, Litote, Tapinsis; when lesse is spoken, and more is meant. Pro. 3.11. despise not the Lords correction (i) highly esteem it. Rom 2.4. despise not the riches of his goodnesse (i) prize it highly. Mal. 2.14. shee is thy compa|nion (i) thy chiefest and choicest com|panion. Heb. 13.4. whoremongers and adulterers God will judge, (i) he will plague them here, and condemne them hereafter. Heb. 10.38. my soul shall take no pleasure in him (i) I greatly abhorre him. Psal. 105.15. Touch not mine anointed (i) hurt them not. 1 Sam. 24.14. whom dost thou pursue, a dead dog, a ea? (i) a poor, weak, contemptible person. Mat. 7.23. depart from me, I know you not (i) I detest you, and will for ever punish you. Marke 3.29. shall never be forgiven (i) shall be eternally punished. Mat. 12.20. a bruised reed he

will not break (i) he will cherish and preserve it. Psal. 5.4, 5. thou art a God that takest no pleasure in wickednesse (i) thou greatly hatest it. Iohn 11.11. La|zarus sleeps (i) is dead. Levit. 26.36. thou shalt fly at the shaking of a leaf. Rom. 4.19. not weak in faith (i) very strong in faith. Revel. 12.11. they loved not their lives unto the death (i) they exposed their lives to all danger, for the cause of Christ. 1 Cor. 10.5. with many of them, God was not well pleased (i) he was highly displeased. [See more, Rule 18.]
Insinuation, is a holy Rheroricall winding our selves into mens affecti|ons; sometimes by loving and sweet compellations, as Rom. 12.1. I beseech you brethren. Sometimes by appeal, as 1 Cor. 11.13. Iudge in your selves is it comely. Sometimes by Anticipation, as Acts 26.27. beleevest thou the Pro|phets?Est in hc A|postrophe acer stimulus quo pungit Agrip pam, ut creda in Christum.  Lap. I know thou beleevest: he would even perswade him, that he be|leeved, and verse 29. I would to God that not onely thou, but that al that hear me this day, were both almost, and alto|gether such as I am, except these bonds; they yet knew not that bonds and suf|fering

for Christ, was a great honour, and therefore hee puts in this excepti|on.
Ironia, Ironicall, taunting speeches may lawfully bee used, as occasion serves.
1. God himself used them. Gen. 3.22. the man is become as one of us (i) as one of the Trinity,Voluit Adam nobis per esum pomi sieri simi|lis, en qum factus est dissi|milis! voluit scire bonum  malum, en in quale ignoran|tiae barathrum corruit.  Lap. wherby God declares his great disdaine of their affectation of an impossible preheminence in being like to God. q. d. by his sin he is become most unlike to us. See how well Satan hath performed his promise to man, is not he become like one of us? and hath not hee gained a goodly measure of knowledge, both of good and evill? So Iudg. 10.14. Go, cry to the gods which yee have chosen. 'Tis an Ironicall up|braiding them for their Idolatry, which they found so comfortlesse, in their greatest need, their Idols being no way able to deliver them. So Isaiah 14.4 8, 9. God himselfe teacheth his people to deide the proud King of Babylon.
2. Christ used it, Mat. 26.45. sleep on. q.d. goe to now, sleep on, take your rest if yee can, behold a perillous time is at hand, wherein yee shall have little list or leisure to sleep.
3. Elijah used it to the Worship|pers of Baal. 1 Kings 18.27. he mocks them, and bids them cry aloud to their drowsy or busie god, peradventure their Baal was asleep, or in a journy, c. So Mica ah bids Ahab goe up and prosper (i) go up and perish, 1 Kings 22.15. So Io [17.2.] taunts at his fale friends, in an ironicall expression: No doubt but yee are the people, and wise|dome shall dye with you. q. d. in your owne concet, there are no men in the world but you. No doubt but reason hath left us, and is given wholly unto you; yea wisedome is so tyed to your persons, that her conservation and mine depends on yours. So Amos 4.4, 5. come to Bethel, and transgresse at Gil|gal,Si sapis, metu mortis  divi|ni judicu resiae|na tuas volup|tats, resiste tu|is cupidtati|bus, amores va|s uri sia, ut judi qui concissi earum usum. ed vu it abusum con|ruoniredlas rationem.  Lap. multiply transgressions, c. q. d. since by no meanes yee will bee reclai|med, but are desperately set on sin; goe on, and fill up the measure of your sin. Thus Solomon, without any breach of charity, or staine of holinesse, checks the young mans olly, with an nony, Eccl. 11.9. Rejoyce O young man, c. but know, c. by an ironicall concession, he bids him  joyce and take his pleasure, c. and then maries all wih a singing

but, in the end. So Paul with an holy scoffe, derides the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 4.8, 10 yee are full, ye are rich, you reign as Kings, c. we are fooles, ye are wise, c. wee are nothing, you are all. c. [ironica est concessio, exprimens Corin|thiorum de seipsis corruptam opinionem. Aretius.]
A Sarcasme, which is a biting taunt, is neer to an Irony, but that it's some|what more bitter, as Gen. 37.19. behold the Dreamer comes! Thus Michal spits out bitter reproaches against Da|vid, 2 Sam. 6.20. How glorious was the King to day? (i) how contemptible and inglorious? Thus Shimet reviled him, 2 Sam. 16.7. Thus the people taunt at Moses, Exod. 14.11. because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou brought us to dye in the wildernesse? Thus the Jewes reviled Christ, Mat. 27.29, 42.In gestu magis qum verbis ostenditur, fit, cum naso sus|penso quippiam fastidimus  enim est nasus. See Mr Leigh on the word  Luk. 4.23. they mocked him, saying, Haile King of the Jewes. Nah. 3.14.
Mycterismus, is a kinde of scoffe, neere to the former. Thus the Pharisees derided Christ, Luke 16.14. they did not simply contemne him, but they shewed their contempt of him by their

gestures; they blow their noses at him, as the originall imports, [, deridebant eum, vel sannis eum excipie|bant. Beza.
Metalepsis, when there are many Tropes in one word, as Mat. 21.10. all the City was moved; the City put for Ierusalem, by a synecdoche generis, and Ierusalem put for its inhabitants, by a Meton. subj. So Mal. 4 2. wings put for beames, by a catachresticall Metaphor, and beams for comfort and refreshing, by a metaphor.
Mimesis, is an imitation of the words of others. Thus David useth the words of rebellious Rulers, Psal. 2.3. let us break their bonds asunder, c. So Paul useth the words of the Epicures. 1 Cor. 15.3. and the Prophet speaks in the language of the Prophane Jewes, who made a mocke at Gods word and threatnings.Irrident ver|bum Dei, ha|bentque pro bal|butie inept. Musculus. Isaiah 28.13. Manda, re|manda, expecta, reexpecta, Tsulazu, Kaw, lakau, Kau lakau, Micah 3.1.
Metaphors are frequent in Scrip|ture, for our apprehension sake. Thus Christ is called a Rock, a Vine, a Lamb, a Lyon, a Shepheard, a Door, a Wav, an Husbandman. So man is called a sha|dow,

a flower, grasse, a Woolfe, Beare, Dog, Isaiah 11.6. Thus we read of Me|taphors from Leaven, Salt, Trees, Seed, Bread, c. besides many hyperbolicall Metaphors, as Psal. 65.13. the fields sing. Hab. 2.11. the stone out of the wals shall cry. Lam. 1.4. the waies mourne. Gen. 4.10. thy brothers blood cryes. [Hee that would see more Scrip|ture Metaphors, from seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, tasting, c. let him peruse Peachams Rhetorick.
Metonymia, 1. Of the efficient cause, thus Moses is oft put for the writings of Moses. Luke 16.29, 31, and 24.27. Iohn 5.45, 46.Nx caput sequitur  pae|na culpam indi|vidua~, uti lictor eum, conitatur Thus sinne is put for the punishment of sin, Gen. 4.7. sin lyeth at the door (i) the punishment of sinne. So Numb. 32.23. your sinne will finde you out (i) the punishment of your sinne. Thus Iohn 7.39. the holy Ghost was not yet given (i) the miraculous and sanctifying gifts of the Holy Ghost, were not to fully given, as they were after Christs ascension. So Gal. 3.27. ye have put on Christ (i) ye are made par|takers of his benefits. Psa. 128.2. labur, put for the food gained by the labour of the hands.
2. A Metonymy of the Subject. Thus by a Sacramental Metonymy the Scrip|ture oft gives to the Sacraments, the names of the things signified by them. Thus Circumcision is called the Cove|nant, Gen. 17.10. when 'twas onely a Seale of the Covenant, and the Paschall Lambe is called the Fuit sgnum il|lius transitus. Met. sub. Passeover, Exod. 12.11. and Baptisme is called the New|birth, Titus 3.5. and the bread Christs body, of which it is a signe, Mat. 26.26. So the cup is put for the wine in the cup, Luke 22.20. (i) vinum poculo con|tentum, continens pro re content] Thus the earth is put for the men in the earth, Gen. 6.11. the earth was corrupt. So Ierusalem, Iudaea, Samaria, are put for their inhabitants. So the house for the people in the house. Luke 19.9. Sal|vation is come to thy house, Act. 26.31. Pr. 11.29.Hebraei per M|tonymiam, qu continens pro contento poni|tur, Deum vocan Scamaim (i) oelum.  Lap. Thus Hel is put for the Devils in Hell  Heaven, for God who dwels in Heaven. Luke 15.18. I have sinned against Heaven (i) against God who dwels in Heaven. So Mat. 21.25. Thus the dayes are put for the men that live in those daies. Ephes. 5.16. and the nest, for the young ones in the nest. Deut. 32.11. as an Eagle stirreth up her

nest (i) provokes her young ones to fly. So the heart is put for all in the heart, the will, affections, and the whole soule, because the soul keeps its chief residence there, though it be in the whole body, and every part of it. Ier. 17.9. the heart is deceitfull (i) the soule with all its faculties and affections. So Deut. 30.6. Psal. 4.4. commune with your heart (i) with your soule. Ier. 4.14. wash thy heart (i) thy whole soule.
Thus the gate is oft put for the Jud|ges, who (among the Jews) sate in the gate, Mat. 16.18. 1 Sam. 4.18. and 9.18. Psal. 69.12. So the tongue is put for the speech. Pro. 10.20. the tongue of the just, is as choise silver. So Pro. 11.10. the City rejoyceth (i) the men in the City. So 2 Cor. 4.4. the end of this world (i) of the wicked who live in the world. So 1 Cor. 11.10. the woman hath power on her head (i) shee hath a vaile or cover, which is a signe of her husbands power  superiority over her.
3. A Metonymy of the adjunct, thus the Governour is oft put for his Army. Saul hath slaine his thousand. So Christ is put for his members. Mat. 25.35. I was hungry, and ye gave me meat (i)

my faithfull members. So Acts 9.4, 5. I am Jesus whom thou persecutest (i) whose Disciples thou persecutest. Psal. 16.6. the lines are fallen (i) the portion divided to me, by cords o lines. Isaiah 34.17. Psal. 78.55.
Thus the Abstract, is oft put for the Concrete.Iustitia est ad|junctum homi|nis. Psal. 11.7. the righteous Lord loveth righteousnesse (i) righte|ous men. Iacob sware by the feare of his father Isaack, Gen. 31.53. (i) by the Lord, whom Isaack feared. So Ephes. 3.10. Col. 1.16. 1 Cor. 12.28. Helps, Go|vernments, for Helpers, Governours. So circumcision, for the persons circum|cised. Gal. 2.12. So Paul is called , Acts 24.5.Sic scelus pro scelesto,  exiiale vocant  (i) exitium, per Autonomasiam.  Lap. not onely a pestilent fel|low, but the very pestilence and plague it selfe. Pro. 11.1. false weights are an abomination (i) men that use false weights are abominable. So the belly is put for a Belly-god. Tit. 1.12. and wic|kednesse for wicked men, Gen. 19.15. [See more, Rule 36.]
Thus the signe is oft put for the thing signified, as, the Scepter for the King|dome, Gen. 49.10. the sword for autho|rity, it being a signe of it. Rom. 13.4. the keyes, for Ecclesiasticall power.

Mat. 16.19. Thus the Name is oft put for the thing it selfe, Rev. 3.4. thou hast a few names (i) men professing the truth. Pro. 18.10. the name of the Lord (i) the Lord himselfe. Phil. 2.10. Ephe. 5.20. Acts. 1.15.
Thus the time it selfe is put for the thing done in time. 1 Cor. 4.3. q. d. I expect another day, beside mans day; now man carries all be|fore him, he hath all the doings now, he may judge  censure as he pleaseth, it is but his day, and I regard it no. mans day (i) ans judgement; save me from this houre (i) from this danger. Iohn 12.27. So Iob 32.7. dayes should speak (i) the aged who have seen many daies.
4. A Metonymy of the effect. 2 Kin. 4.10. death is in the pot (i) poyson or some deadly thing, which causeth death. So Mar. 9 17, 25. a dumb spirit (i) making men dumb. Rom. 8.6. to be carnally minded is death, (i) tendeth to death, or bringeth death. So Rom. 6. ult. and 7.7. is the Law sin? (i) is it the cause of sin? Heb. 11.39. they received not the promises (i) the fruit of the pro|mises, for they had the promises, but the accomplishment was in the time of the Gospell. Iohn 3.19. this is the condem|nation (i) a speciall cause of condemna|tion. Iohn 17.3. this is life eternall (i) 'tis the way to life eternall. Gen. 25.23. two Nations (i) the fathers of two Nations.

Thus the Law is said to be pure, righte|ous, c. Psal. 19.8, 9. because it makes men so.
5. A Metonymy of the matter. Gen. 3.19. dust thou art (i) thou art formed out of the dust. Psal. 105.18. he was laid in Iron (i) in setters. Psal. 115.4. their Idols are silver and gold (i) made of such metall.
Paranomasia, is a pleasant sound of words, as Psal. 21.7. In te confisi, nun|qua~ confusi. So Isa. 5.7. in the Original, is an excellent Paranomasia. Mispal Mis|pach, Zadaca Zeaca. So Rom. 2.1. in quae alum damnas, teipsum condemnas . So in the Greek there is an excllent Paranomasy. 2 Cor. 4.8, 9. , c. haesi|tamus, at non prorsus haeremus. So Mat. 8.22. let the dead bury the dead. 2 Tim. 4.2. . So 1 Tim. 3.16. Rom. 12.2. Mat. 16 18. and 24.7. Phil. 3.2.3.19. [See the Originall] 2 Cor. 6.10. as poor, yet making many rich, as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. So Bethel shall be Beth-aven Amos 5.5. Psal. 25.16. Gna ani, afflictus ego c. Hosea 4.18. aabu hebu amnt ona.
Periphrasis, is the using many words for one thing. Thus Iohn 21.20 the Disciple whom Jesus loved (i) Iohn. The fruit of the vine (i) wine. To lay down this Tabernacle (i) to dye. The Doctor of the Gentiles (i) Paul. The Father of lying and murther (i) the De|vill. So death is called the going the way of all the earth because none can escape it: and Solomon cals it our long home, c.
Pleonasmus, the most wise God con|descending to our rude and weak capa|city, oft useth sacred Peonasmes, or the better clearing of things to our under|standing, and beating them into our dul apprehensions. So Deut. 13.4. those in|culcations are not vaine, but serve to worke things the better upon our hard hearts. So Deut. 32.6. O foolish people and unwise. 1 Iohn 1.1. wee have seen with our eyes, c. Iohn 1.3. and 6.33, 34, 35. Mat. 5.2, c. Christ cals himself seven times there the bread of life. The Psalmes are full of such pleonasticall inculcations. The Scripture is ot exege|tical, what it speaks darkly in one place, it explains in another.
Polyptoton, is a variation of cases, as

Rom. 11.36. of him, from him, to him, c. Iohn 17.25. 2 Cor. 12.14 Luke 8.5.
Polysyndeton, when words and sen|tences are knit together, with many copulatives, as 1 Cor. 13.1, 2, 3. and though I have the gift of prophesie, and understand all mysteries, and all know|ledge, c. So Gal. 4.10. Ro. 8.38, 39.
Prolepsis, or Hypophora, is the pre|vention of an objection, as Pro. 3.9. Ho|nour the Lord with thy riches. Ob. So I may beggar my selfe: he prevents this objection, so shall thy barnes be filled. So Mat. 6.33. first seek spirituals, above and before temporals. Ob. So I may im|paire my wealth, health, c. He pre|vents this, all these things shall be cast as an over-plus into the bargaine. So Iohn 11.2. [See more, Rule 27.]
Prosopopaeia, the faining of a person, as when wee bring in the inanimate creatures, speaking or hearing, c. So 1 Kings 13.2. O Altar, Altar, thus saith the Lord: he speaks to the Altar, as if it were a person that heard him. Psal. 98.7.8. let the sea roare, and the floods clap their hands, and the hils rejoice. Rom. 8.19, 20, 21. The Apostle brings in the creature waiting, groaning, travelling.

So Isaiah 35.1, 2. he attributes joy and singing to the wildernesse. See a most lively, rhetorical, prosopopeical descrip|tion of the terrible Army of the Babylo|nians, Ioel 2.1.10 12. So Ioshua 24.27. this stone shall be a witnesse, for it hath heard all the words of the Lord. Isaiah 1.2. Heare O Heavens c. Iudges 9.8. Iotham brings in the trees, speaking like men. The Olive will not leave his fatnesse, nor the Figtree his sweetnesse, nor the Vine his wine, to reigne over others;Stultitiae est, ab|ect  libertate, spresis piis Ma|gistratibus, om|nem potestatem impio, improbo, crudeli nebuloni committere. Wolphius in locum. but tis the bramble, that affects soveraignty and dominion, a base, scrat|ching, worthlesse, fruitlesse shrub, good for nothing but to stop gaps, and keep out beasts, from spoyling the pleasant fields, and afterward to bee burnt. [Rhamnus exilis est, unde vix umbram jacit quae protegar, ac sub se delitescentes pungit  stimulat.  Lap.
Synecdoche generis, when a generall word comprehends the particular. Mar. 16.15. Goe preach the Gospell to every creature (i) to every rationall creature. Psal. 1.6. the Lord knowes the way of the righteous. viz. with a knowledge of favour and approbation. So Amos 8.14. they sweare by the sin

of Samaria (i) by the Idol that is placed there (i) the golden Calves. Thus wic|kednesse is put for Idolatry, Zach. 5.8. and for Incest, Levit. 20.19. Thus the Philistine is put for Goliath, the Apostle for Paul, our Saviour for Christ. Mat. 11.18. Iohn came neither eating nor drinking. viz. after the common man|ner. Gen 31.21. Iacob fled over the Ri|ver (i) Euphrates. Psal. 19.7. the Law of the Lord (i) the whole word of God. 1 Cor. 6.12. all things are lawfull (i) all adiaphorous things. Ier. 8.6. no man (i) very few.
Thus the whole is oft put for a part, as Mat. 3.5. all Iudaea went forth (i) a great part. So 1 Kings 10.24. all the earth went to heare the wisedome of Solomon. Mat. 4.23. he healed all disea|ses (i) all sorts of diseases presented to his cure. Luke 2.1. all the world was taxed (i) all the Provinces belonging to Augustus. 1 Tim. 2.3. who will have all men to be saved, c. (i) all the Elect, of what Nation or Degree soever. Rom. 10.12 God is rich to all (i) to all that truly call upon him. Heb. 2.9. he tasted death for every man (i) for every san|ctified man. ver. 10. All in Scripture, is

oft taken distributively, for some of all sorts, not collectively for the whole masse of mankind. The ignorance of this distinction is the ground of many errors amongst us.
Thus the plurall number is put for the singular, as Mat. 27.44. the thieves (i) one of the thieves upbraided him.
2. Synecdoche speciei, when a par|ticular implies the generall, Mat. 4.4. and Per panem, n|tellige onia hujus vitae admi nicula, ut cibum, potum, vesti|menta. 6.11. bread (i) all kind of food. So Gen. 3.19. Thus peace is oft put for all temporall blessings. So a brother is put for a Kinsman, Mat. 12.47. thy brethren are without (i) thy kinsmen Caesar for the chiefe Magistrate. Mat. 22.21.
Thus a part is put for the whole, Rom. 13.1. let every soule (i) let every man be subject. So the roof is put for the house, Mat. 8 8. So Gen. 46.26. all the soules that came out of Egypt. Eze. 18. the soule that sinnes. So the body is put for the whole man. Rom. 12.1. Thus prayer is oft put synecdochically for the whole worship of God. Luke 18.20. two men went up to the Temple to pray (i) to worship God. So Rom 10.12, 13. Ioel 2.32. Acts 2.21. Gen. 4.26. and 12.8. first, because it is a speciall

part of Gods worship, very pleasing to him. 2. Because prayer must accom|pany every Ordinance, Luke 18.12. I fast twice in the Sabbath (i) in the week.A potiori die hepdomas vo|catur Sabba|thum.  Lap. Thus oft the denomination is gi|ven from the better part; as Sion for all Ierusalem, and Ierusalem for all Iu|dah.
Thus the feare of the Lord is oft put for the worship of God. Pro. 14.26. Psal. 130.4. Deut. 6.13. Acts 10.35. Psal. 128.1 and 112.1.
Thus the hand is put for the whole man, Pro. 10.4. and the head for the whole man, Pro. 11.26. blessing shall be upon the head of, c. Pro. 3.22. grace to thy neck (i) to thy whole man.
Thus the singular number is put for the plurall. Ier. 8.7. the stroke knows her time (i) the strokes. Numb. 6.24 22. the Kenite (i) the Kenites shall be wasted. Iob 14.1. man (i) all men have but a short time.
Thus a certaine number is put for an uncertaine. Zach. 3.9. Christ is said to have seven eyes (i) many, to signifie his singular care over his Church. So Rev. 1.20. and 5.6. Deut. 28.7.25. y seven wayes (i) many wayes. Psal. 12.6.

Iob 5.19. Psal. 119.164. seven times a day. Pro. 24.16. the righteous falleth seven times a day (i) oft. Eccl. 11, 2, 9. Mat. 12.45. seven other spirits, c. If any desire to see these Tropes and Fi|gures more fully explained, let him per|use the learned, Glassius his Philologia, the second Part.

HISTRIO-MASTIX. A whip for WEBSTER (as 'tis conceived) the Quon|dam PLAYER: OR, An examination of one Iohn Websters delusive Examen of Aca|demies; where the Sophistry, Vanity, and insufficiency of his New-found-light (tending to the sub|version of Universities, Philosophers, Physitians, Magistrates, Mini|sters) is briefly discove|red,  the contrary truth asserted.
In the end there is annexed an elaborate de|fence of Logick, by a very Learned Pen.

The Preface to the Reader.
Courteous Reader,
_AFter I had finisht my Vindiciae Li|teraru~, or Schools Guarded, my Sta|tioner sent me downe one Web|ster, an enemy to Arts and Ar|tists, desiring me to send some briefe Answer to it; upon this I fell to examine Websters Exa|men and found him so soul false  bitter against Humane Lear|ning, and Vniversities (both which I defended in my Vindi|ciae) that I thought it conveni|ent to vindicate what I had as|serted, and to leave the Logicall

and Philosophicall part to be ex|amined by those whom it more especially concerned: which since I penned my discourse, I find to be done so elaborately and accu|ratly, by Dr Wilkins, and Dr Ward. two very learned pens (in their Vindiciae Academi|arum) that I was resolved to lay my own Answer by, and had done so, but that I received a very learned defence, of Aristotelian Logick, which I judged worthy of the publick view. If thou reap any benefit by this Tract, let God have the praise, and the Reve|rend cute Logician thy thanks, whose elaborate Animadversi|ons, have drawn this, from thy
Friend and Servant in the Lord, THO|MAS HALL.
Kingsnorton Speb. 4. 1654.





Examen Examinis: OR, A word to Mr Webster, concerning his examina|tion of ACADEMIES.
_SIR Hercules, (for in that Title I perceiue you glory) in your Epistle to the Universities, you tell us that you never feared any Adversary, for his supposed strength and if any one inquire Who, or What you are, you tell him, that you are neither Prelaticall, Presbyterian, nor Independent. But what shall we then call you? if any one

aske, tell him (say you) that Hercules is easily known by his foot, and the Lyon by his paw, c. We see then who you are, viz. an Herculean-Leveller, a Fa|malisticall Lion,Iesuita est om|nis homo. Our Webster is some kin to them, for he can change with every time, c. a dissembling Fryar, a Profane Stage-Player, and professed friend to Judicial Astrology and Aro|logers, such as lying Ly-ly, Booker, Cul|pepper, c. A great stickler for the fire and Furnace of Chymestry, for Magick and Physiognomy, c. I must confesse I never et saw your person; but let me tell you, I have seen your Lions paw, and Levelling club, wherewith you think to beat down Universities, Humane Lear|ning, c. and in their stead, to set up your owne Idle and Addle conceits. What spirit leads you, appeares [page 8 of your book] where you tell us, Ar|rius is called a Heretick, but you questi|on how justly [a tender conscienced nan indeed] but as for the Orthodox, Wo to hem! for you tell us they all wrest the Scriptures to make good their Tenents [a heavy charge, could you make it good]
The Proverb saies, Ne Hercules con|tra duos sed t contra ducentos, imo . If Hercules may not ight against

two, what an Hercules are you, that dare oppose more then two thousand, and Goliath-like, bid defiance to all the Academies and Armies of the living God: you tel us plainly, that in your igh flowne conceit, Homo is a common name to all men. All those viri Dei, those holy-learned men of God, which are in the Land, if they be not of your Familisticall-Levelling-Magicall tem|per; they are all in your eye, but hmi|nes, plebeian, low and common men, c. How much better had it become you, like Hercules, to have endeavoured the cleansing of that Augaean stable of er|rours, Heresies and blasphemies, which like a Morphew, have over-spread the face of the Church; to have cut off those Hydra's heads, and helpt our Atlasses to hold up the Heaven of the Church. It had been more for your credit and comfort to have imployed your time and Talent in defence of Languages, Arts and Sciences, (especially in such a season as this, when so many decry them) then thus to weave the Spiders Web, which may peradventure catch some feeble flies, when stronger ones break thorough.
Bibitur auro venenum.'Tis true, sometimes you gild over your errors with golden words, and set a glosse upon your false wares: but poy|son is never the better for being drunke out of a golden cup, the whore of Baby|lon deales so with her guests, Rev. 17.4. and the Apostle tels us, that false Tea|chers, with faire words and fine spee|ches, do deceive the simple, with plai|stred words, they parget over the mat|ter. Rom. 16.18. 2 Pet. 2.3. Alludit ad Mercatores qui verbs fictis  arte compositis, supra veritatem laudant  ex|tollunt suas merces, ut faci| s cas extru|dant,  caris vendant.

But that you may see your folly the better. 1. I shall begin with your contradictions. Sometimes you plead for Academicall learning, and anon you cry it downe; like a Thiefe, we some|times find you in the way, and present|ly you are crossing it againe. Thus [page 3.] you cry up Humane Learning as good, excellent, and of manifold transcendent use; whilest moving in its owne Orbe, it enables men for all kind of undertakings, Military and Ci|vill, without which, men doe not dif|fer much from beasts, c. [So page 8, 9.] yet as if you had forgot what you had

said, in the same page you tell us (how truly let the world judge) that this hu|mane learning, disables men for the Ministry, is a vaine Tradition, and makes men uncapable of Gospell mysteries, c.
Quo teneam vultus mutantem protea nodo?
So, one while you plead for tea|ching children without the Grammar Rules [page 22] yet page 24. you cry up Mr Brinslyes way of teaching, which every one knowes (who knowes the Method of that Godly man) hath refe|rence to Rules.
2. Your sophistry, and fallacious ar|guing is very frequent, to give you a taste onely,I find it done already, very acurately, by Dr Ward in his Vindiciae Academiarum. (for as you desire to stirre up some to plead your cause, so I doubt not but some of the Lords Worthies, who have more time and Talents for such worke, will arise and plead his cause more fully.)
1.He's against Learning. You tell us, that humane learning puffs men up, makes men selfe-confi|dent and proud; that it is but a carnall thing, a fleshly power, (just so say your brethren, the Familists, and Anabap|tists) that the I have pro|ved the contra|ry in my Vindi|ciae Literarum Apostles never taught

or practised any such matter, but bad us beware of Philosophy, Col. 2.8. for it is a fleshly weapon, earthly, sensuall, dive|lish, an Idoll of mans inventing, spiri|tuall sorcery or inchantment, yea Rea|son is a Monster, and the very root and ground of all Infidelity, c.
Answ. Behold here that Damask-Web, (as his verifying friend cals it) which Mr Webster weaves. 1. He Ar|gues from the abuse of a thing, to the taking away its use; because some men abuse humane learning to pride, and selfe-conceitednesse, therefore away with humane learning, Non sequitur; for then, because some men abuse, meat, drinke, cloaths and riches; wee must throw away meat, drinke, cloaths and riches.
2. It is not Philosophy simply, that the Apostle condemnes, Col. 2.8. but vaine,V. Vindiciae Literarum. c. 2. page 30. spoyling, abusive Philosophy; as you may see more fully in my vindicati|on of that place.
3. Neither is humane learning a car|nall, fleshly, sensuall Idoll of mans in|venting; but the good gift of God, com|ming from the Father of lights, who is purity it selfe: As I have proved at large,

in my Vindiciae Literarum.
4. Neither is Reason a Monster (as you Monster-like affirme) but being rightly improved, is a great helpe in Religion; as is excellently proved, by the learned Culverwell in his profound discourse, of the light of Nature: fit it is fit we should give unto Reason, the things which are Reasons, and to Faith, the things which are Faiths.
Ob. But 'tis the spirit (saies Master Webster) that must teach us, and the spi|rit that must unlock the Scriptures, and the spirit that must inlighten us, c.
Answ. True, but yet the spirit of God works by meanes (as I have pro|ved before in my Vindiciae.) Who ever expects helpe from God,V. Vindiciae Li|terarum, Prefu. must not sit still and dreame the spirit will help him; but he must arise, and serve Providence in the use of meanes; for the spirits Teaching doth not exclude, but include the use of all good meanes, c.
Yet that you see Mr Webster's Her|culean strength, he comes now to grapple even with Aristotle himselfe [c. 6.] this Chapter he spends wholly,He's against Aristotle. in combating with him; no lesse Adver|sary then the Prince of Philosophers

can try his strength. 1. He tels us, that Aristotle was but a man, and so might erre; and is not Mr Webster a ma? and doth he not erre with a witnesse? 2 He tels us, that what Aristotle hath writ|ten, was rather by a Diabolicall, then a Divine instinct [I rather suspect that he is led by a Diabolicall instinct, that speaks it.] 3 His Principles are false, his Manners corrupt, many of his books spurious; besides, hee is ambiguous, briefe, ame intricate, erroneous c. In a word, a blind Pagan, the proud Stag|rite. I wish he were not more blind, corrupt and proud that speaks it]
Qu. But since Aristotelicall Philo|sophy wil not downe with Mr Webster, what new-light shorter cut, and easier way hath this Hercules found out: for like another Caesar, Viam aut invenie aut faciet. He'll ither find a way, or frae you one out of his empty sconce?
Ans. Why, 'tis Magick [page 68, c.] that noble,Noe, 'tis Dia|bolicall Ma|gick, which Webster pleads for, as appeas by his com+mending Lilly the Wizard. and almost divine sci|ence (as he cals it) of naturall Magick. This key (if you will believe him) will better unlock natures Cabinet, then syl|logismes; yet he coplaines, that this is neglected by the Schools, yea hated

and abhorred, and the very name seems nauseous and execrable to them. [and that very justly considering whether your Magick leads men] But O Magick, Magick, where hast thou ame hid so long, that Mr Webster is faine to con|jure thee up againe, and none but he and his associates, could find out this short cut before? 'Tis true, there is Astronomy, which is an Art that consi|ders the divers aspects, and naturall pro|perties of the Starres, and this is law|full. But then there is See Perkins 1 Vol. p. 39 and 43, 44. Magia Diabo|lica, a Divelish Magick, when men take upon them, to foretell things con|tingent, by the Stars, those are called ju|dicial Astrologers, and in Scripture they are oft joyned with Witches, wizards, and Sorcerers, Deu. 18 10, 11. Dan. 2.2, c. yet this Devilish Art, doth Mr Web|ster plead for [page 51] and spends wel|nigh a page, in the commendation of Astrology and Astrologers, such as Lil|ly, Booker, Culpepper, c. 1. He cals it a Science or Art. The learned Weemse 4. Tom. on the Magitian. page 62. Weem|se hath proved the contrary; yea, the Lord Verulam (whom he cites so oft) is here against him.Lord Verulam's Advancement of Learning. p. 147. Astrology (saith he) is corrupted with so much superstition,

that there is hardly to bee found, any sound part in it.Aug. de doct. Christian l. 2. chap. 21. S. Austin that had stu|died this way, yet concludes, Astrolo|gia est magnus error,  magna demen|tia, c. 'tis a great errour, a great mad|nesse, and superstition easily refelled.
2. Yet he cals this a high, a noble, an excellent Astrologia ju|diciaria non est Scientia. Thes. Cantab. 1654. Science, and usefull to all mankinde; a study, not unbeseeming the best wits, and greatest Schollars, no way offensive to God or true Religi|on, c.
A dangerous and false assertion, the contrary whereof, is most true in the judgement and experience,See Wendelius Physic. c. 27, 28. page 620.630. and Weems Magitian. sect. 7. of all godly learned men such as Calvin Beza, Per|kins, Weemes, Gataker, Geree Vicars c. they all condemne it, as a most ignoble, dangerous study, unbeseeing choice wits, offensive both to God, and all good men. Hence these judiciall Astrologers were formerly excommunicated, and cast out of the Church; and by the De|crees of Emperours, banisht out of the Common-wealth. Never more need of punishing such offenders, when they are grown so bold, and brazen-faced, as to publish their lies and abominations in Print to the world, and so provoke God

to forsake us, Isaiah 2.6. Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people, because they be replenished from the East, and are South|sayers, like the Philistines. 'Tis an Art that leads men to the Devil, I have con|ferred with some, and read as much of others, who have gone about to study this Art (as Webster cals it) they have been faine to throw away their books, for feare of Satans appearing; so readie is he to step in, when once he finds us out of Gods way Usuallie, such are Wi|sards, and therefore I cannot but won|der how Mr Webster durst be so impu|dent, as to commend the worth, vertue, and learning, not onely of these lying, de|luding Prognosticators, Booker and Cul|pepper, but he also extols that lying, ray|ling, ignorant Wizard, Ly-ly, who hath not onely reviled the most learned and Reverend Mr Gataker, with the Ortho|dox Ministry of the Land; but with his lies, hath abused both Church and State, to the great dishonour of the Nation: as appeares by the pious and judicious Mr Gataker's Vindication of his Anno|tations, on Ier. 10.2.
And since Mr Webster talks so much of this noble Science, and what suffici|ent

Reasons he could give in defence of Mr Lillie's Astrology, he may doe well in his next Pamphlet, to prove it a sci|ence, and to bring forth his strong Rea|sons. In the meane time I shall love humane learning the better, whilest I live, because 'tis opposed by Star-gazers, and judiciall Astrologers: as David lo|ved Gods Law the more, because wic|ked men sought to destroy it, Psal. 119.126, 127. the Father tels us, Nil nisi grande aliquod bonum quod  Nerone damnatm, It must needs bee good, which wicked Nero hates. So humane learning must needs bee good, which Astrologers and Wizards hate and op|pose. And that you may see the same spirit which breaths in Lilly, dwels in Webster, he useth the lying, railing lan|guage of Lilly. Shall the thundring Pul|pit-men (saies Lillian Webster) who would have all mens faith pinned upon their sleeves [this is as true as all the rest] and usually condemne all things they understand not [it seems Mr Web|ster knowes more in this Art, then ho|nester men doe,] make mee silent in so just a cause? [Oh no, tis a ime of li|berty, and you think you may be bold,

but such as you must know, that though you may for a time, escape the punish|ment of men, yet you cannot escape the revenging hand of the Almighty, but as you have sinned against the Lord, so be sure first or last, your sinne will finde you out. And yet that all the world may see what spirit leads this man, tis worth observing, whom he commends, not only Lilly and Booker, but also Fryar Bacon [sic mulus mulum, it becomes one Fryar to claw another] and Para|celsus, a Libertine, a Drunkard, a man of little learning, and lesse Latine; he was not only skilled in naturall Magick, (the utmost bounds whereof, border'd on the suburbs of Hell) but is charged to converse constantly with Familiars,See more, Ful|lers Hoy state, lib. 2. cap. 3. and to have the Devill for his Purse|bearer, yet this is one of Mr Websters society. Noscitur ex comite, c. Like Lettice, like Lips; such as his company is, such is he.
Add to this, his praising the study of Physiognomy, as an excellent, laudable, and profitable Science; [which yet the Learned judge vaine and foolish] also his extolling of Chymistry, and prefer|ring it before Aristotelian Philosophy,

and advising schollars to leave their Li|braries, and fall to Laboratories, putting their hands to the coales and Furnace. [So they may quickly find pro thesauro carbones, beggary instead of Learning, and walking thus in the sparks of their owne fire, lie down in sorrow, Isaiah 50..] this is Mr Webster's short cut, a quick way to bring men to the De|vill or the Devill to them.
2. Mr Webster having sufficiently railed on Aristotle, the Prince of Philo|sophers, next he fals foule on Galen,3. He's against Galen, and Physitians. the Father of Physitians, onely for building on Aristotles Principles; out of his ig|norance, hee cals him an ignorant Pa|gan, an Idoll, a blinde guide, c. and at last fals foully on the Physitians them|selves [page 107.]
4. He' against Ministers.3. He comes now to Ministers, and railes on them, for suffering themselves to be stiled by that blasphemous title of Divines; this the Priests (that Title to shew his contempt of the Ministry, hee puts on the Ministers of the Gospell, though that Title be never given them, qu Ministers in al the New Testament) blasphemously assume to themselves.
Ans. 1. 'Tis false, the Title is not

blasphemous, for 'tis given to S. Iohn, who is called by way of eminency, and distinction, , The Divine. As Theology and Divinity are termes con|vertible in our language, so is a Theo|logue and a Divine, the same in sense, though it differ in sound: and therefore if the Scots do well (as you say they do) in calling their Ministers Theologues; then ours do not ill, in speaking plaine English, and calling them onely for di|stinction sake, Divines (i) men set a|part for the study of Theology or Divi|nity. Now see the wit, or if you will the malice of this Magus, this Magitian (for hee pleads for the lawfulnesse of such Titles.) The Scots (saith he) may call their Ministers Theologues; but our peo|ple, may not call their Ministers Di|vines. This distinction is like the mans, that said, Pepper was hot in operation, but cold in working.
2. 'Tis false that we assume it, much more that we blasphemouslie assume it to our selves if people will give us that Title, onely for distinction sake, who can hinder him?
3. The ground hee builds on, is rot|ten. viz. 1. Because holinesse is essen|tiallie

proper to God. 2. Be cause wee are Holy and Divine by participation onely, therefore wee may not be called Holy and Divine.
Ans. The answer is easie. Though to be holy and Divine, be essentially proper unto God, yet by way of Ana|logie and resemblance, it is also given to Angels and men. Hence the godly in this life, are called Saints, holy, and in the very letter, partakers of the Divine Nature, [2 Pet. 1.4.] not essentiallie, but Analogicallie, partaking of those graces whereby we resemble God.
He's against Magistrates4. He fals foule on Magistrates, and tes them plainie [page 98.] that they must not at all intermeddle with the things of God, lest misere and destru|ction follow them to the grave, c.
Ans. What is this but to destroy the Magistracie? to rob them of their coer|cive power, and make them like Saint George, that sits with a drawn sword, but never strikes (a sit emblem of Mr Websters Magistrates.)
Ob. But Mr Webster would have them punish Theeves, Murtherers, A|dulterers and Drunkards, onely they must not punish the Saints, lest God re|quire

the blood of his Saints at their hands. [page 98.]
Ans. 1. If the Magistrate must punish Theeves, Murtherers, c. then  forti|ori he must much more punish spirituall Murtherers, Theeves, c. for as 'tis a greater sinne to kill the soule, then to kil the body, so they deserve severer punish|ment. 'Tis no Policy, but cruelty, to suf|fer Woolves and Foxes to destroy the flock: neither is the coercive power of the Magistracy, under the Law, aboli|shed by the Gospell, as is excellently cleared by Mr Prin, in a Treatise called the Sword of the Magistrate; and since by Mr Cobbet on the same subject.
2. The Saints must bee considered under a double notion. 1. As Saints walking up to their principles and li|ving in the feare of God, and hee that abuseth and kils such Saints simply on this account, must look to answer for their blood.
But 2. Consider the Saints, as erring and wandring from their Principles, by Adultery, Murther, Drunkennesse, Here|sie, c. and so they may and must be punished, though not as Saints, yet as sinning and transgressing Saints: yea

though they should plead conscience for what they doe, and say, as Mr Bur|roughs in his Irenicum c. 6. p. 34 proves.
Thus you see, how Mr Webster is a|gainst learning, against Aristotle, against Magistracie, against Ministrie, against Physitians, and against all that is truly good: like Ismael, his hand is against every man, and therefore it's just that every mans hand should be against him.
Q. But what is the summe of Mr Websters desires, and what would hee have us to studie?
A. Hee tels you. 1. That you must lay aside al your paper Idols, and sleight Aristotle, who hath in him, many things frivolous, vaine, false and need|lesse.
2. He tels you, that you give up your selfe to Mathematicks, Opticks, Geo|metry, Geography, Astrology, Arithme|tick, Physiognomie, Magick, Protechny, Chymistry, Pneumatithmy, Stratarith|metry, Dactylogy, Stenography, Archi|tecture; and to the soule ravishing study of Salt, Sulphure  Mercury [a medicine for a Hore] These, these, if you will be|lieve Mr Webster, are the onely excel|lent studies for Academians.
But Sir, if these inferiour Arts (the alwfulnesse of some of them being just|lie questionable) be so usefull and excel|lent as you affirme, then  fortior Logi|que (which you sleight as prejudiciall to Theology) and Physicks, Ethicks, c. with the superiour Arts and Scien|ces, must needs be much more excel|lent, and therefore Mr Webster is much to be blamed, for crying up those low, inferiour, emptie things; and crying downe those choice, ingenious, usefull Arts and Sciences, which doe so much fit and further men in their preparation to Divine studies.
To conclude, the world may here see, what stuffe still comes from Lame Giles Calvers shop, that forge of the De|vil, from whence so many blasphemous, lying, scandalous Pamphlets, for many yeers past, have spread over the Land, to the great dishonour of the Nation, in the sight of the Nations round about us, and to the provocation of Gods wrath against us, which will certainly breake forth, both upon the actors  tolerators of such intollerable errours, without speedy reformation and amendment.
Since I framed this discourse, there came to my hands, a very accurate and learned Examen, of Mr Websters illogi|call Logick, which now followes in it's order.


Examen Examinis. An Examination of Mr WEBSTERS Illogicall Logick, and Reasoning even against Reason.
_THis Mr Webster (as I suppose) is that Poet, whose Glory was once to be the Author of As the Dvils Law-Case. Stage-plaies, but now the Tutor of U|niversities. But be|cause his Stage-Players have been dis|countenanced by one of the late Par|liaments; does he therefore addresse himselfe to the Army for the like force, and as little favour in behalfe of all Hu|mane

Learning? for advancement whereof,Reperto quod est optimum, qui aliud quaerit, pejus vult. Quintil. the best way being already found, he that seeks for another, desires worse (and so none at all) though he pretend to a Reformation. For my own part, I could wish that his Poetry still had flourished upon Mr Iohnson's ac|count, in his Epistle before one of his Playes (the Fox) to the two most equal Sisters; the Unniversities (a far better ad|dress, then this here) but it is odious to be like the Fox in the Fable, who having lost his owne Ornaent, envied his fel|lows theirs, by pretending burthen or inconvenience. I have neither leisure nor lust, to examine all his Examen; but yet to know Hercules by his foot, I can|not but observe how in his Chapter of Logick, he Reasons against Reason: and as Diogenes accused Plato, with a worse pride of his owne; so he prosecutes A|ristotle, under the name of Arch-So|phister, indeed with his owne sophisms; which what may we call but envy and pride, those two Mothers (saith Aqui|nas) of discord: whil'st one through en|vy, recedes from the way and will of another, through pride, to prefer his owne As Quintilian (if that Dialogue

de Oratoribus be his) condemnes the Oratory of his time, as abused to incense the people in Principes viros, ut est na|tura invidiae: not sparing (not onely Sy|la and Pompey, but) even Scipio him|selfe; or as Livy: Et ante alios in Caemil|lum.
But what if Oratory be thus abused to calumniating, should there be there|fore no Oratory at all? or if Logick to cavilling, no right reason at all? as in|deed there is none such without the orderly use of it, for rationis est ordinare (saith Aquinas) and that is best done, not by the Web which is here woven, to unravell all Humane Sciences, but by the Art of Logick. Such a Master whereof, was Aristotle that of him we may say for knowledge, as for vertue, Valerius Maximus of the said Scipio, Quem Deus immortalis nasci voluit, ut asset in quo se virtus per omnes numeros hominibus efficaciter ostenderet.
But let us see, what against so glori|a light, and to falsifie the sight or sense of all ages hitherto, is here produced by him, who hoc tantm rectum quod sapt ipse puat.
Chap. 4. . 1. What here he saith, is

no more then may be objected against any Science or Art (though never so much by himselfe approved) e. g. his owne late Poetry, and now beloved Astrology (yea the Gospell of Peace it selfe may bee abused for war and dis|cord:) but whatsoever Finis operantis the aim of the Logitian is, the Finis operis. end of the Art is truth.
As to that of Aristotle, for which so vehemently he inveighs against, or ra|ther proudly insults over him; the more strongly the opponent maintaines his part (for which purpose in his Topicks, he supplies him with store of Argu|ments) the respondent his, the more effectuall is their disputation, for the end thereof, viz. the dicovery of truth: as Scaliger saith, ut ex silice  ferro elicitur ignis, it conflictu ingeniorum veritas. And besides, in his Politicks also, he observes the rules to be kept for upholding Tyranny: but will Mr Web|ster therefore conclude, that he allows of that way of Government?
Sect. 2. Or is truth his owne end, in accusing whole Universities of most rationall men, and even Logick it selfe, as proceeding very preposterously, whereas, Logick is indeed the Mistriss

of all due method to all Sciences, and to himselfe if methodicall. As if the Prince in whom as supream consists the Order of the whole community, should be ac|cused himselfe for breaking it, which as such, whether good or evil, he keeps, though if evill, not so well as he might; and by keeping his subjects in it, pre|serves them by it: for all things consist in order, which confounded, they come to naught. Logick, as such, proceeds or|derly, directing the minde in the know|ledge of truth, as first in the apprehen|sion of simple Termes, and then in the composition and division of the same, and last of all in Discourse, without confusion, falshood, or fallacy. In which last, it proceeds as well  posteriori, by induction, to find out the truth, or to know that such an affection is the true property of such a subject: as  priori, by demonstration, to perfect the know|ledge of it: for then is the knowledge distinct and perfect, when the thing is known as it is, as the effect by the cause, as it is by its cause, which is the order of Nature: and not the cause by its ef|fect, which is our Method, through the imperfection of our Intellect, deriving

its notions from sense, and so beginning  posteriori, but  parte rei, indeed pre|posterous. First, then doth Logick pro|ceed preposterously, because to advance our Reason as neer as may bee, to the Angelicall manner of understanding, by knowing things (as they are di|stinctly and perfectly) it teacheth us to proceed in the order of Nature, or to begin  priori? 2. As to say that induction hath altogether been layed a|side, is most false, and against sense: So Reason requires that syllogismes (wherein we prove and demonstrate the effect by the cause) be preferred be|fore it. So that whilest he extols (and for a new method of his own, against all establisht and approved order) so highly cries up induction before syllo|gismes, his owne is the errour which he condemnes, and therein hee proceeds preposterously.
Sect. 3. Here also the defect pre|tended, is his owne; in not acknowled|ging, both how fit are the denomina|tions of Genus, Spcies, c. to the No|tions thereby exprest, and these Notions adequate to the things we conceive by them. For gathering of which Notions,

the certaine Rules which he seems to desire, but indeed rejects them, are these two. Comparison of things, as to that wherein all agree, for the community, and abstraction thereof, from differen|ces, whether essentiall or accidentall, for the unity of the simple essence, which hath thus the generall denomi|nation of an universall, and is either of one kind comprehending infinite sin|gulars, accidentally onely different, as Homo, and so is fitly exprest by the word species: or generally comprehen|sive of divers kinds, both constituted in themselves, and distinct one from ano|ther, by their proper essentiall differen|ces, as Animal, Animatum, Composi|tum, Corpus, Substantia, and so as fitly is called Genus; which is either summum, and so is not at all; as a species it selfe subordinate, as substantia, or subalter|num, which in repect of a superiour, Genus it selfe is a Species, and to alter|no respectu both, as Corpus, compositum, Animatum, Animal.
The Genus then is divided into se|verall species, which are either subal|ternae, as having under them other Spe|cies, in respect whereof they are also

Genera: or infimae, as superiour to no species at all, but onely to its owne singulars; in which the division rests, as in so many Individuals.
Now, have we not here, both noti|ons adequate to the things, and words as fit to expresse these Notions? or in all this excellent order, can Mr Webster invent confusion?
But he would shew, that hee hath read, and seems to understand the Lord Bacon, in his Novum Organon, though his testimony be nothing for him, Sintiones ip|sae confusae sin, c. as Hypotheticall, and so not Propositio hy|pothetica nibil ponit in esse. Positivly true, till the condition be first proved: but without any proofe thereof Mr Websters Thesis is absolute, and so false.
Sect. 4. The said Notions, and de|terminations, concerning which, there, are given a few, plaine, cae, necessary and useful Precepts, are some of the hardest passages wherein are exercised the unskifull and tender wits of young men: and so far are the Questions and Disputes, which are agitated by riper judgements, from derogating from their Art, that rather they add to it, c.
Ans. Whereas here he objects that they do not see that they act as foolishly

(even those of the best judgements) while they dispute of the very Art of Disputing, as he that endeavours to see the proper vision of his owne eye: his owne is indeed the blindnesse, in not seeing the difference of Understanding and sense.
Turpe est doctori, cum culpa redar|guit ipsum.
For the eye, or the outward sense, apprehends not its own Act, being nei|ther colour, nor light, nor the difference of its owne, from the proper objects of other senses. e. g. that which pronoun|ceth White to differ from sweet, is nei|ther the sight nor tast, whereof each apprehend but one of them, and so can|not judge of both 3. but the inward or common sense, as judge of the Acts and Objects of all the outward: where|as the Understanding, whose object is universall, or all things knowable, is re|flexive to know it selfe, its owne Acts and Objects and then as the soule of man is both the Object, Subject, and Author of its owne disputes, while by reflexion, it knows it selfe. So the Lo|gician reflecting upon his owne facul|ty, may dispute of what sort it is, whe|ther

Science or Art, which, as directing the mind by its denominations, propo|sitions, syllogismes, where the end is to act accordingly, is an Art; and yet as reflecting upon it selfe, its owne Acts and Objects, where the end is know|ledge, may be called a Science too.
Sect. 5. How can hee blame the Stagirite, for not defining or dispu|ting, what Logick is, what a Catego|ry is, what substance or quantity is; if herein hee should act as foolishly, as he that endeavours to see the proper vision of his owne eye. But ad rem. Neither is he indeed, nor his Interpre|ters, guilty of such defects, as here he fancies, and fastens on him, whose end is contention, to make the contention endlesse. But for the proposition and distribution, two of his subjects.
Magnus Aristoteles trutinando ca|cumina rerum
In duo divisit quicquid in orbe fuit.
The members of which two heads, he handles in their order: Nor is there|fore his Organon, so organized, a confu|sed headlesse piece.
But such is his owne objection a|gainst his booke de Interpretatione,

where the Moods of Propositions, are made neither more nor fewer then four, viz. necessary, impossible, possible, and contingent. For what is so plaine, as that the matter of all discourse, is either necessary, or impossible, or possible, or contingent; and so may well be redu|ced to these foure. Manners or Moods, so called, because they specifie, how the predicate belongs, or not, to the subject of the proposition; For all that we can conceive or expresse, is either necessary, if it cannot but bee, or impossible if it cannot bee, or possible, if it may be, though it be not yet, nor ever shall bee; or contingent, if it be or shall be, though it might not have been, or may never be.
But see here, how Mr Webster, so sub|tle and quick-sighted in seeing the De|fects of Aristotle, is blind in his owne. See it in his owne instances. Having prmised the definition of a Mood, that it doth modificate the proposition (i) in|dicate how the predicate is in the sub|ject, he infers, and insults, may not all Adjectives by the like right be Moods? No, because they are all reduced to those foure before mentioned: but hee

saith, if this be a Modall proposition, it is a necessary thing, that man is a living Creature, these also are Modall; it is an honest thing, that a man should be stu|dious of virtue; it's a just thing, a sonne should obey his Father; it's a gallant thing to dye for ones Country. Where, if his propositions be these, man is stu|dious of virtue, the sonne obedient to his Father, one dyes for his Country, their matter is all contingent. Or if these; man to be studious of virtue, is an honest thing, a sonne to obey his Fa|ther, a just thing, one to dye for his Country, a gallant thing; so his Adje|ctives are no Moods at all (to shew how the Predicate is in the subject) but themselves the Predicates, and in all his propositions, the matter is onely necessary.
So that his errour is, as if Aristotle had designed to assigne the Modall, as a distinct species of proposition, and not onely to give one generall Rule, for all the species before enumerated, as that their matter is either necessary, or im|possible, or possible, or contingent.
Sect. 6. Nor is he more Orthodox or busie, to better purpose, in the matter

of definition, where the office of Lo|gick is, onely to give the Precept or Rule, how it ought to be made, which to explaine by example, it takes the instance from other Sciences: Nor is Logick to define what Homo or Ani|mal is, this being the part of Naturall Philosophy, as to treat of it's proper subject. Now the precept which Lo|gick gives for the definition of things in actu signato, as that it ought to consist of the next Genus, and a constitutive difference, is ost true, exact, and infal|lible: and therefore i in actu exercito, animal rationale, be not indeed the true definition of man, the errour is the Phi|losophers, who must find out for his owne subject, the next Genus, and con|stitutive difference (as religiosum, or the like, i not rational) according to the Rules and Precepts, which in Lo|gick he hath for both; to make (by the Rules for that too) the definition ex|act and perfect: So that the same which Mr Webster before objected against Lo|gicians, as that they seem to make Lo|gick a part of Physicks, hee is guilty of here himselfe.
But because as an open enemy to

our Physicks, as well as our Logick, he would equally glory in the defects and errours of both; the truth is that the errour is all his owne: for that bruit beasts are irrationall creatures, and so rationall the proper difference of man, it appeares. 1. By comparing, as man with Angels, so the said bruits with man: For Angels are intuitive, meere or simple intelligences, as seeing both in the sight of the subject, what is attribu|ted or denyed to it without compositi|on or division: and in the sight of the Principle, what flowes from it without discourse and so we men also are intel|ligent creatures, but not as Angels, the operation of whose Intellect, is onely the apprehension of simple termes, and not lyable to falshood; for besides that we have two other, to compound or divide, and to discourse, and so are ra|tionall too; which being thus our essen|tiall difference, little lower then the Angels, is yet common to us with bruit beasts.
2. That Rationale is not a graduall onely, but our essentiall difference, it is evident at least by this, that whereas Gradus on variat speciem, in us specifi|cally

distinct, is the principle of reason, from any in bruit beasts, as appeares As Mr Webster saith, that wee know nothing in nature, but  posteriore, and from the affe|ctions and properties of things must seek for their causes.  posteriori, by the properties of it, as ap|titude to speak, c. which we have as rationall.
And whereas further he saith, that irrationall is negative, and so can posi|tively prove nothing. This his sequell were true, if it were negative secundum rem and not onely seundum ocem. e.g. immortall is also negative, and yet if St Pauls Argument from the word mortall, be of force, when he saith,  not sinne raign in your mortall bodis; how much more is that of St Peter abstaine from fleshly lusts, which warre against your [immortall] soules.
Now as immortall (applyed to God, Angels, and the reasonable souls of men) implyes more then a meere negation of dying, for otherwise, all things but li|ving creatures, should be imortall. So irrationall, speaks the positive and spe|cificall nature of a bruit beast, as rati|onall, that of man, though in so great a scarcity and inequality of words to things we bee destitute of a better way to expresse the same: for why doe wee say, that the Ox is irrationall, and not

as well that the stone is so, since the negative of reason in both is alike, and the habit undue to both; but that irrati|onall implyes that positive Nature, whereof the one is partaker, and not the other.
2. I should wonder that one who is so contentious, seeking all occasions to cavill, should omit division; were it not hereby evident, that hee hath no|thing to say against it.
But why doth hee make such hast in his wrath against Reason, to come to Argumentation? or what can be made more absolute (without addition or alteration by some curious wits, in so many ages of men) or so exact as our Art of syllogizing. But Novelists moved with the spirit of pride and envy, are out of love as with all that others have invented, and not themselves, so even most with the best, for the greater glo|ry of reformation. Yea whereas other inventions are concerning such out|ward things as we use more seldome, wee have continuall use of our owne Reason and yet still is our Art of syllo|gizing, so imperfect a thing, that now one should presume to abrogate it? He

mislikes, that so many sorts of our syllo|gismes conclude negatively, since it is sufficiently known, that de negativis non dar scientia but doth he not know as well, that por negativa datur? yea, himselfe saith, and alledgeth his Au|thor for it, that humane Science doth consist in a certaine negation of falsity, rather then in the affirmation of veri|ty.
It is undenyably true (saith he) that the knowledge of the premises is more certaine, then the knowledge of the conclusion, and therefore undoubtedly certaine, that the knowledge of the conformity, betwixt the premises and the conclusion, doth praeexist in us; where both the consequent may bee true, and the antecedent; but how doe they hang together? Grammatically indeed in the Copulative words, and therefore: but hee defies all Logicall wayes of Arguing. Or how is it that the said knowledge before, and without the syllogisme, may bee said to be, or praeexist in us? not in Act, but onely in aptitude (as Alex. Alens Metaphys. one saith, that aptitudo ad rem est aliquid ipsius rei;) which aptitude is reduced to Act (without

which it should bee in vaine) or the knowledge (saith Mr Webster himselfe) excited by syllogizing; and yet is syl|logizing also in vaine? or in procuring that act, uselesse? else why doth he say, and therefore why dost thou torment and macerate thy selfe in that question, which is more subtile to despise then to dissolve? which (since nothing can bee inferred from a thing wherein it is not contained) is another therefore without inference subtilty beyond sense, and a sleighting or despising (not of some vaine questi|on, but) of so useful a thing, as the best of Logick it selfe, against reason.
Ob. And so is that which here hee objects, saying, that sometimes from false premises, there doth follow a true conclusion, as in this syllogisme,
Nullum adorabile est Creator,
Omne simulacrum est adcrabile, Ergo,
Nullum simulacrum est Creator.
Nor can it therefore be judged, that the conclusion of syllogismes, doth of necessity compell Assent, or that the

conclusion doth necessarily depend up|on the premises, as the truth is not con|tained in a lye, nor the knowledge of it.
Ans. 1. We say not that that in syllo|gisms, which of necessity compels, assent is the conclusion it selfe, but the premi|ses, when out of them it is rightly pro|ved (i) when the premises both are true and well ordered in Mood and fi|gure, Assent to the conclusion is made necessary; for ex veris nil nisi verum, and that by vertue of the right order and disposition in Mood and Figure, for otherwise out of true premises, there may follow a false conclusion: as
Omnis asinus est animal,
Omnis homo est animal, Ergo,
Omnis homo est asinus.
So then we are taught in the first and second part of our Logick, to make the premises true, and in the third, so to dis|pose and order them, as to necessitate Assent to that, which we make our con|clusion from; and yet is all this so despi|cable, that Mr Webster extolling his owne subtlety, and the force of his Un|derstanding,

should not onely, not seek, but reject it's true helpes?
2. The conclusion indeed doth ne|cessarily depend upon the premises, in respect of the forme at least, as the con|clusion of a true syllogisme, and so doth that of his syllogisme before mentio|ned: or in respect of the matter too, as a true conclusion and so not.
3. Whereas it is objected, that as the truth is not contained in a lye, so no more is that true conclusion in the false premises.
The premises both are true (i) they are true propositions for the substance, categoricall, for the quantity univer|sall, for the quality, vocis; the one Ne|gative, the other Affirmative; and re, both false; yea even because false, they are therefore true propositions. For in simple termes, and in speeches not e|nuntiative, there is neither alshood nor Truth; but if you make Homo, or homo albus, either true or false, you make a true proposition of it; and if to one such, you add another in Mood, and Figure, there is true disposition too, for a true syllogisme. So that even the true conclusion of false premises is

contained in and deduced out of them, in respect of the forme, for so are they also true though not in respect of the matter, since that is false.
Lastly, To all that in the residue of the Chapter, he objects or cavils against Lo|gick, may that serve, which before was answered? as that by direction thereof wee doe defend the truth, as the true definitions of things, and infer out of true premises, rightly ordered, undeni|able conclusions, whereby wee have not onely bare Opinations, Putations, or probable Conjectures; but infallible Science, and Apodicticall to informe and satisfie the Intellect, by evidentiall demonstration.
Whereas Mr Webster cavilling a|gainst all reason, contradicts and con|founds his owne. As first, when he saith [Numb. 4.] a Chymist when he shews me the preparation of the Sulphur of Acrimony, the Salt of Tartar, the Spirit of Vitrioll and the uses of them, he tea|cheth me that knowledge, which I was ignorant of before, the like of which no Logick ever performed: having said immediately before, that demonstrati|on, and the knowledge of it, is in the

Teacher, in whom it serves to demon|strate and to shew it others, who learn it of him. Againe [Num. 5.] he con|demnes all Logick, as conducing to no other knowledge, then such as is duely probable and conjecturall; as if that were not more then such, which is ac|quired by demonstration.
Besides, he most highly extols Astro|logy, and the now Professors thereof, his friends, as common enemies with him, as well even to Divinity it selfe, as to Logick and humane learning; who presume by their Art, to foretell As the fall of Law and Di|vinity. such future contingencies, as depending on mans free will, are not known to An|gels themselves, unlesse by Durand and others. conjecture onely, or revelation. And have any the best Astrologers, so cleare a Light, as to see by the Heavens more, then these Heavenly lights themselves, or as Mr Webster, then all wise men? Yea how grossely have they failed in things even meerly naturall, conjecturing at As Mr San|ders, one of the most learned of them. raine and showers, during all the late winter drought; but not at all of the later rain, as if God had provided both to disco|ver their grand Imposturage and pre|sumption, if not impiety, in taking men

off from himselfe the first, to ascribe all or too much to Nature, and second causes.
All which is to me, a sufficient evi|dence, that this great Examiner, not|withstanding his faire pretences of Re|formation and truth, might, if thorough|ly examined himself, be found not stee|ring his course indeed by right zeale to these,In his Epistle Dedie. but by that which he also seems to disclaime, even selfe-interest.
However, certaine it is, that truth or reformation, cannot be truly sought in a way against Nature as is here Mr Web|sters in preferring himselfe, before all the wisest and best in all Ages, to inform and Reforme his Mothers, the Univer|sities; for
Quicquid ex|primitur in na|tura, imprimi|tur ab intelli|gentia, scil ex|plicante, medi|ante natur. Alex. Alcus c:
Opus naturae est opus intelligen|tiae.Nunquam aliud Natura, aliud sapi|entia dicit.

Nature Gods owne true wisedome is, and then,
Is never tharted by the truth of men.

Truth and truth can never jarr. . Aristot.
