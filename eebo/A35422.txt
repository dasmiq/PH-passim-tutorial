THE DECLARATION
of the Right Honourable Henry Earle
of Cumberland, Together with divers Gentlemen
of the County of York, who desire it may be
put in print, and published in all the Parish
Churches of this County.
_WHereas it appears, That some Gen|tlemen
of this Countie, have given
information to one of the Members
of the House of Commons, of many
great oppressions exercised upon
His Majesties Subjects here, And
that a Tyrannicall government is founded, under
pretence of His Majesties service; and have thereby,
and upon that misinformation, drawn a Decla|ration
from the Lords and Commons, bearing date
the twentieth of August instant, to be published
to the people, which is grounded upon those, and
divers other false informations: We hold it our du|ties
to the Honourable Houses, to the satisfaction of
the County, and vindication of our own honours
and integrity herein, to declare, That we are so far
from being contrivers, or Instruments of Arbitrary

Government or Tyranny, or doing any Act,
whereby the Countrey may receive losse, or suffer
violence, That all our endeavours shall tend to no
other end, then to assur it from spoile and rapine,
and to protect every person therein, (as farre as we
can) from injury and oppression.
To the better advancement of which good de|sires
and resolutions, the Grand Jury (the represen|tative
body of this County) at the Assizes last hol|den,
presented their humble requests to His Sacred
Majestie, and received thereunto His Gracious ap|probation:
And thereupon some progresse hath
been made, and resolutions taken, ayming onely
at the tranquillity of this County, and at no other
end or purpose whatsoever: And if any have, or
do mis-understand those propositions, or wrest
them to any other sence then they were intended,
they do it without any ground at all. For we pro|fesse,
That we have not gone about to conceive,
or act any thing, for sinister or by respects, but
onely for the benefit and peace of the County in
generall, and of every particular Person therein; and
that we conceive our doings, warranted by the Law
of Nature and Necessity, and Authorized by a
former order of Parliament, which declares, That
such Counties as put themselves in a posture of de|fence,
have done nothing but what is justifiable:

And in pursuance wheof, and agreeing upon the
like Resolutions and Propositions to these, we have
formerly received approbation, and publike thanks
from the House of Commons.
We do therefore further unanimously publish to
all lovers of Peace, That we neither have, nor will
do any act, or acts of other nature, or tending
to other consequence, then those formerly agreed
on in this County, upon the like occasion, by
the Iustices of Peace, the eight and twentieth of
Ianuary last, and for which, we, by order from the
House of Commons, received thanks the first of
February following. As also, That we will not go
about to take the Arms of any honest Gentlemen,
Yeomen, or Towns-men, as we perceive is falsely
misreported to the House, we having Our selves
hitherto done no such thing, nor intending
as far as in us lies, to suffer others to do the same,
unlesse we be enforced to the contrary by hostile
actions, or pregnant suspicions from the parties.
We do likewise promise, That we will preserve to
our uttermost endevours, the peace of the County,
and by all just wayes, oppose, and bring to punish|ment
all such as plunder and pillage any person or
persons of what degree, quality, or profession so|ever
in this County.
That we will constantly, and with one minde,

aide and assist all his Mjesties Subjects, to de|fend
them from oppression or violence, and not
go about to take any mans goods, or levie money
by force.
These, and no other being our united resoluti|ons,
we are confident they will receive the assistance
and concurrence of the whole County, to bring to
a wished effect a work of so much safety and con|cernment
unto us all.
And therefore (according to the Presentment
of the Grand Jury, who resolved, that lesse then
eight thousand, six hundred, and fourty pounds,
two shillings six pence, could not performe this ne|cessary
work) we have proportioned (according to
ancient and unquestioned rates) the said Sum, and
have sent the severall proportions agreed upon, just|ly
rated, to every Parish; not at all doubting, but
that every mans good affection to his Countrey,
and care of his own well being, will prompt him,
with all cheerfulnesse, to put his ready hand to
such a pious and necessary work, which we desire
may be speedily put in execution in every respective
Parish, the people called together by the Miniter,
Constable, Churhwardens, and Overseers of the
poor, or some other well-affected persons, and the
name of those men returned in writing, who do
accordingly pay, or agree to pay their pro|portions;

together wit the names of those
(which we cannot beleeve will be many) who are
backward, or deny to pay so small a Sum, thus
laid in ballance, with the safety of themselves and
their Countrey. And if there be any so void of af|fection
to his Countrey, as to refuse his concur|rence
in this affair, of such generall and particular
concernment, we shall wash our hands, as guilt|lesse
from the consequence of that crime, and rest sa|tisfied
with the conscience of our good endea|vours,
for Unity, Peace, and a right understanding,
the onely way to render this County safe
and flourishing, and every particular person void
of fear and mistakings, and assured of his person,
goods, and family.
Since these, and no other, are the determinati|ons
of our (by some so much mistaken) meetings,
if any who have not hitherto been present with
us, will, for the time to come assist us, with their
company and advice, they shall be willingly re|ceived,
as members of the same County, enjoy free
liberty of debate, and receive suteable respect; that
so, with united hearts and hands, we may all joyne
together, to the glory of God, the service of our
King, the preservation of true Religion, and the
tranquillity and assurance of this our Countrey.
FINIS.
