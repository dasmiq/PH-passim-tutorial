THE HECTORS: OR THE FALSE CHALLENGE. A COMEDY Written in the Year, MDCLV.
 The SCENE LONDON.
LONDON, Printed for G. Bedel, and T. Collins, and are to be sold at their Shop at the Middle-Temple Gate in Fleet-streee 1656.




I'Ll not enquire why this All-knowing Age
Hath crop'd the Laurell, that adorn'd the Stage,
That Loooking-Glasse of Morals, whose reflex
Shew'd most their errors, whom it most did vex.
But this I'le say, who e're the Author be
Of this same piece, if't were my chance to see
Him; as I have this issue of his brain,
I'de beg the favour, that hee'd write again;
For till I read it from the self same pen,
Such height of Sense and Wit, I ne're agen
Shall hope to see; a strain (when read) you'l say,
(As many things now are) in a new way.
Here's Comick mirth, yet mix't with serious lines,
As if the Author had dig'd up the mines
Of Mercury and Plato, and cull'd thence
Their chiefest treasure, and would it dispense
In plain, though lively phrase. Here's no Courts, no Kings,
(I do suppose the Author thought such things
Not now in use.) And what is yet more rare,
Here is no dabling Poet, no nor bare,
Poor Belgick Captain; But what's most a wonder,
You shall but once read here Iove and Thunder;
No Academick wit, the Senses five,
Or Liber all Sciences not here contrive
Into a plot he doth, or wedding make
Upon Parnassus, or a storie take
From Lucian. I shall puzzle you, you'l cry,
What a deuce then can this play e're be? Why
It isBut stay, read it your selfe, and then
Judge rightly, and I'me sure you'l quit my pen.

THE HECTORS: OR THE FALSE CHALLENGE.
ACT I.

SCENE I.
Enter Mrs. Pate and Mrs. Lovewit.

Pate.
_HE is indeed a pretty Gentleman.


Lovewit.
How well his dancing did become him!


Pate.
He had a very handsome and unaffected way.


Love.
His Discourse too (me thinks) I did extremely fancy, it was not too much starched with Formality, nor yet rudely loose.


Pate.
He was though in my mind somewhat too full of his Comple|ments.


Love.
Yet they were still so fitted to, and grounded on what was said, that he cannot but have a sudden and quick wit.


Pat.
He carried indeed the whole Entertainment through with an exceeding grace.


Love.
Some would have spent five times as much, yet forced our good natures in the end to have laughed at it. Prethee what is he?


Pat.
Why do you not know, child of ignorance?


Love.
You know I came to th' Town but yesterday.


Pat.
O it is true: And I pray you how do a  our friends in Sur|rey? My Cozen Norris? and Mrs. Nonesuch.


Love.
They all desire to be remembred; but


Pat.
How did my Cozen like the Stuff I bought her for her Gown?



Love.
Very well. But prethee


Pat.
I did the best I could to please her fancy.


Lov.
But what was that we were a talking of? O, of the Gentleman; what is he?


Pat.
Why he i one that lives here about the Town of a fair Estate, his name is Welbred, he has now for some while been a servant of your Cozens.


Lov.
Me thought he applyed himself much to her. Dot think she ere will love him?


Pat.
Love him? How can she otherwise chuse? Thre is not a La twix Lud-gate-hill and Westminster but is ready to run mad for him; at the first ight he smites and kis, where e're he comes, there's none that can withstand him.


Lov.
But yet me thinks But rethee let us talk no more of him. Enter Mrs. Crisis and Mrs. Bud.


Pat.
Stay, here is your Cozen: Prethee what Girle is that wih her?


Lov.
It is a friends Daughter of mine in the Country, that goeth to School here in London; she came up with me.


Crisi.
Affection! Where hast thou been? I have been looking for thee all over the house.


Lov.
I your Affection, and you keep things so close from mee!


Cris.
What things I pray?


Lov.
You need not make so strange, for I know all: there is a Lad, they say, that smites and kils where e're he comes, and you are she in whom he intends to finish all his Conquests.


Cris.
Smite! and kil! Where e're he comes! Why, I hope, it is ot the old bald fellow with the Sithe on his neck, old Monsieur Time? Smite, and kill! Strange, terrible words! What meanest thou?


Lov.
I mean, he makes them talk or dream of him for a week, or so, or perhaps sigh or whine a little.


Cris.
Hold there, as for talking or dreaming I am for you, but do you think I e're shall sigh for him? I know whom you mean.


Lov.
Why not?


Cris.
Not I, as I live.


Lov.
Spoke she but true!Aside.


Cris.
And yet the man deserveth well, as men now are. He is (I must confesse) a handsom sprightful youth, well qualified in most things that become a Gentleman: and since it is my friends desire that I should marry, he is one (I think) I should not be ashamed in company to own for a Husband.


Lov.
O my unhappy fortune!Aside.


Cris.
The man I don't dislike, 'tis possible I might stay for a worse; and as possible, if I did stay, I might have a better, for I see nothing in him in which I could place my happiness.


Lov.
No Bu how come we to talk of this Gentleman again?



Pat.
Believe me, thou lovest him with a pretty indifferent love.


Lov.
Her Love was certainly articled and agreed on by the old man her father. But let us find somewhat else to entertain the time withal. And now I think of it, what was that Gentlewoman who was there last night in the Sky coloured Satten Gown?


Pat.
O she is one of the great wits of the Town.


Love.
I thought so, yet Mr. Welbred put her shrewdly to it.


Pat.
Her mind runs on nothing but Welbred, I think.


Cris.
They say that thou too (Affection) goest for a kind of Coun|try wit, what e're thou ailest to be thus sober here.


Love.
Sitting up so late last night hath somewhat disordered me, I confesse.


Cris.
But as thou hopest to be married under thirty, think not of it.


Lov.
Why, I pray? for that is somewhat a terrible Conjuration.


Cris.
Why? A female wit is a strange prodigious kind of thing, it frights off all that have no wit, and they that have will never come on, except it be for an Afternoon or so, to exercise their tongues. I have been out of conceit with it ever since I heard a Gentleman say, that he was going to a Lady that I know, a reputed wit, to prepare him for a Visit to his Mistris. Fye upon it, a thing fit for nothing, but to make one a common courting stock. I hate the very thought of it.


Love.
Well then, if we must not think on them that have wit, let us think on them that have none: and first, how did you like the Gentleman that was there last night with the black curled hair:


Pat.
With the black curled hair?


Cris.
O, I know whom she means, it was a friend of that same Gen|tlewomans, she was here with him this morning to invite me to such another businesse to night. But why, I pray, dost thou take him to have no wit? Doth he pay all the Reckonings where e're he comes? Will he drink deep with a Lad that will keep a brace of Geldings and a Lac|quey out of twenty pound a year? A dammee Captain, or an Oxford Majo, and then game with them?


Love.
No, I dare pass my word for him.


Cris.
Why, these are the only modern fools.


Lov.
Well, I cannot tell what you call a fool, (I must confesse) I am a little too young to be his Godmother, but yet me thinks, a dull and stupid thing (as I conceive him to be) should have a name.


Pate.
I am sure if he had had any thing in him, there was a Lady gave him a fair opportunity to shew it.


Lov.
Mr. Welbred would have paid her home.


Pat.
I was a great while in doubt whether he could speak or no.


Cris.
Well, I cannot tell,for ought I know, he might serve with a good Jointure to boot; for my part, I saw him do nothing much ab|surd. And had you been here to day, you would have thought his si|lence last night, to have been more out of choice then any thing else.



Bud.
Really Cozen, there was a rare Gentleman in the slash'd dou|blet, and a button'd Cap, me thought he talk'd incomparably.


Love.
Whom doth she mean?


Pat.
Mr. Lagul certainly


Cris.
Alas poor soul!


Pat.
Well, I must be going.


Cris.
Nay, prethee stay a little longer.


Pat.
No, I have appointed to meet one,


Cris.
Who  Mr. Hadland, I'll warrant you.


Pat.
'Tis no matter for that.


Cris.
Well, I hope when you come to lye at this end of the Town a|gain, we shall more enjoy your company. Exit Pate.


Love.
O Mrs. Pate.Exeunt Lovewit and Bud after Pate.


Cris.
alone.
My Cozen too is certainly in love with him, for I have ob|served her mind all this day strangely musing, although sometimes it be disguised with some forced flashes of mirth: what e're is talked of, her thoughts still run on him, and then she will recal her self, not think|ing that affected hiding shewes what else would ne're be mark'd. 'Tis strange to see how generally this Gentleman doth take: For my part, as I see not any thing in him that I much mislike, so truly naught that I admire: He has (I must confesse) some graceful and becom|ing parts and qualities, a handsome way in talk; yet when I mark it seriously, me thinks it is as curious Pictures, which (although they make a pleasing shew, yet) for the most part are drawn on course and ordinary matter. I needs must say, he has this happinesse, that if he excel in ought, it is in things of that familiar nature, that each place and company he comes in, afford him opportunity to shew it. And this certainly is the only thing that makes him make a greater blaze then some of far more worth, whose eminence lying in that which is more choice, cannot so frequently discover it self, nor is their value prostituted unto every eye; but they, as great Bels, who are not easily nor on all slight occasions raised, yet being up, will far out sound any of these tinckling ting-tang blades.Would heaven alot me but such a one to spend my time withal, it would be what I most desire; but yet I think I shall scarce run that odious fortune of a stale Maid in expecta|tion of such a blessing. Enter Maid.


Maid.
Mr. Welbred is come (forsooth) and desires to speak to you.


Cris.
Carry him into the Dining Room, and tell him I will wait up|on him presently. Exit Maid.
Stay, He will now set hard upon me, what shall I do? Yeeld? No, me thinks my fancy at this time doth not prompt me to it; I wil once more put him off, if handsomely I can. Exit.




SCENE II.
Enter Lovewit.

Love.
He will not out of my mind, but doth over rule my thoughts and force them to desires vaine and impossible: I impossible, for h must needs fix on her, she is a Lady so without exception, of so fair a Fortune and such exquisite parts improved unto the height. He cer|tainly then is hers; me thinks the very thought of that should be e|nough to master these desires; for usually Objects, though ne're so pleasing, if not probable, searce stir the mind; for since we all are rational, it were absurd our wills should act in vain. But on the con|trary, when things with ease may be attained, we never give over until we are arrived at the utmost of our wishes. Thus nothing is more ordinary then for my Lady to love her Gentleman, or Mrs. Anne her fathers man. But if a Country Clowne coming up hither, and seeking for his Lawyer in Grayes Inne, should step into the Walks, and there should chance to spye some Master-piece of Nature, some fam'd Beau|ty, that for a time hath born the name, he would stand amazed, per|haps wish that his Ione were such, but farther would not be stirred, impossibility would stop more bold desires, and quench those sparks that else would turne to fires. But I without the remedy of hope, even in despair, begin a love that promiseth nought but grief and endlesse teares. But here he comes with my Cozen, I will stand and hear what they say. Enter Welbred and Crisis.


Wel.
Come sweet Lady be no longer cruel, 'tis fit for vulgar com|mon beauties to inhance the price of their Enjoyment by a long de|nyal; such Art were vain in you, and desperate in me, since I al|ready am wound up unto the highest, and higher cannot go but break.


Cris.
Must I answer to all this presently? that me thinks would bee the greatest inequality in the world; in all reason certainly I should have as much time as you had to study it.


Wel.
Study it? He that is inspired doth not so little deliberate; I speak my very thoughts, on you my mind doth naturally run, nor can it va|ry, for Nature that hath in you raised Beauty to its highest pitch, out|done her own Idea's, hath thereby made you Commandresse of my soul, and all its passions and affects to wait on none but you; there|fore seeing you have the power, O do no longer tyrranize.


Cris.
Why, what now would you have me say?


Wel.
What would I have you say? Can that be a question? Could your breath create me owner of the world, could I have diversity of woulds? Alas my thoughts are long since fixed on you, and my desires forgot all other Objects but your self.



Cris.
My self? then that is it you would have.


Well.
O God,Would have? I, above


Lov.
I am lost, undone, undone:Within.


Cris.
Nay, pray now let me go, for you have me not yet, I must first chide you a little for this kind of language. What things do you think us women to be? Or rather, what would you have us our selves to fancy? For could I, me thinks, bu look into the brest of some fond silly Gile, and see what thoughts she entertaines, by that time such a blade as you hath told her some such stories, that she gives Beauty being, and other faces to be accounted of as they partake of hers; that she can smite, wound, kill, as if the fate of all mankind did hang upon her will, and twenty such things more, which if the poor thing have but wit enough to uderstand, she is (without mercy) ru|in'd, lost, undone.


Well.
Why I pray, Lady? for this is somewhat strange.


Cris.
I'll warrant you I have a reason for what I say; for fist, she thinks her self somewhat (though what she cannot tell) that hath a just quarrel to Fate, that she can have nought but so poor a thing as man her mate; she fancies not this mean, she fancies not ano|thers Discourse, she hates this mans breeding, she hates anothers face, and for that coloured hair she refuseth a thousand pounds a year. Thus she continues for some years, until at the last, about some twenty nine, she doth begin to understand herself. But now the tide of Sutors and her beauty being eb'd, she stands a Fare for the next that comes; and in all haste she makes some desperate match, proves some old mans Nurse; perchance not so well, but Will her fathers man, her Taylor, or some Reformado Captain must serve her turne; or else (if she have any spirit) in a melancholy pet, she vowes a Virgin life, and for his sake that first deceived her, turnes man-hater. Come, come, in faith Sir you are to blame, were I now some kind of Lasse, forty to one but that I were meerely cozened of a good Hus|band.


Wel.
Did one ever see such a plaguy Wench as this? Aside. Not at all, Madam, are we to be blamed for what we are forced unto, such high flowne speeches are no more then what all will challenge, Epithites not of the fair, but woman, meer Titles due by custome and long use, nor can they be denyed without breach of Civility: Al|though I must confesse sometimes, I give them with as much regret as when I call some base poor spirited thing Right Honourable.


Cris.
Truly, Sir, in my mind, a very ingenuous confession.


Wel.
She were as fond that would believe them, as if she should give credit to her Mercer; meet words of course, a tone the tongue must run in for fashions sake.


Cris.
Say you so? I have then so little hope to make you see your fault, that I will spend no more time about it. Your servant Sir, I must be going a little way. She ffers to go out, he pulls her back.



Well.
Nay deare Lady, I had as good part from my better An|gel.


Cris.
What? these are your words of course? Pray let me go.


Wel.
Nay, but in earnest Lady, you are the only party of all the world, in whose enjoyment I could think all happinesse con|fin'd.


Cris.
She were as fond that would belive.


Wel.
Slid, what shall I do now? Believe, do you say Lady? O could you but look into my thoughts: the tortured wretch speaks not a truth more credible; the latest breath of dying men is not so sincere as what I say. Believe me? it would question your Discretion (Madam) to do otherwise; it cannot but be so in nature; it is as impossible for you not to cause these passions in me, as for fire not to burn a matter combustible.


Cris.
Language due by custom and long use.


Wel.
Sfoot, what shall I do? she will outwit me this way, I must try another. Aside.
Well Mrs. Crisis, come, the truth of it is, I love thee; thou art handsom enough in conscience;  hast a little too much wit for a wife; but I don't doubt but I should rule it wel enough: wherefore prethee keep no more fooling, but let the Parson be doing.


Cris.
Well Sir, I will be as plain as you, it is possible you may love me, although the language you have chosen to expresse your love in, hath not (in my mind) a little prejudiced it. For my part, I do hate none living, nor will I forswear to marry you; but I must needs say, I am not yet quite resolved on it, in things of such consequence I cannot too much consider. Pray let this for this time suffice.


Wel.
Well then, if it must, I will leave you to consider until annon. You will go, to Hide Park as you promised?


Cris.
I shall be ready to wait upon you.


Wel.
In the mean time, let this make you think of me.

Gives her a Ring.

Cris.
Nay, Mr. Welbred.


Wel.
'Tis but a trifle. Exeunt.

Enter Lovewit.

Love.
As when a close besieged Town, opening a secret Sally Port to receive some scouting Spies, in rushes the pursuing enemy, and they with their Intelligence receive their ruine: So I, through my too in|quisitive ear have let in that which cuts me to the heart. O Welbred! did I but know thee to be made miserable? Or should I have been more wretched in not knowing thee? It is impossible she should with|stand a fresh assault; this Journey to Hide Park will end the business, and begin my wo. But shall I like some neglected wretch, left on an unknown shore, only look and stare after my happinesse, that with full gale is flying from me? Can there be nothing done, but to pre|vent this present threatning mischief? O what? What shall I do?
Stay,that would go nigh to do it, if not, it will however be a hand|som way to discover my affection, which custom hath made (in me) im|modesty to do.it wil be an odd kind of thing though; It is no matter, even nature bids us shun a present danger, though we future hazards run. Exit.



SCENE III.
Enter Lagul and Mrs Bud, Mrs. Crisis standing at the other
door, beckens to Lovewit, to the end that she
should come and hear what thty say.

Lag.
What (Madam) is it a Massacre resolv'd, is killing one by one grown tedious sport?Aglaura Scen. 3. Act. 1.


Cris.
Did ever poor Sir Iohn think thus to be abused?


Bud.
Really Sir, it pleaseth you to speak far beyond my deserts.


Lag.
O God, Madam, your Deserts are far transcending whatsoever I can say, Divinity inhabits in your face, and your cheeks contain the Elixar of all perfection.


Bud.
I am confident Sir, it pleaseth you to say so.


Lag.
Madam, I should esteem my self incomparably felicitous, if you would vouchsafe to honour me this Afternoon with your com|pany to Hide Park, and grace my Coach with your transcendent beauty.


Bud.
Really my company will be no honour, but rather disgrace you.


Lag.
I presume not so (Madam) for your Beauty doth anihila|tize all others.


Cris.
Heark, Anihilatize, me thinks it is a pretty word.


Love.
It is a great deal of pity it should signifie nothing.


Lag.
For by this fair hand, Madam


Love.
He is almost spent, I know by his beginning to toy with her, I will go and relieve him. She goeth to him with Crisis.
Monsieur Lagul, your servant; What? making new Conquests? Have you no pity on our Sex? If you go on thus, we shall look on you as on some common threatning mischief that will destroy us all.


Lag.
It is my eternal felicity Madam,But I presume.


Love.
You do indeed, to forget your old friends; What was the matter, I pray, we did not see you in the Country according to your promise?


Lag.
Really, Madam, I did ruminate in my thoughts to kiss your hands, but fortune was not so propitious to me as to favour me with that felicity.


Cris.
It favoured her I am sure. Aside.



Lov.
Why what was the matter?


Lag.
I must confess (Madam) there hath an accident or two fal|len out of late, that hath taken me up, and made me extremely unci|vil in this nature unto all my friends; I shall certainly be weary of these Duels in the end, if it be but for this cause.


Cris.
So, now he is in. Aside.


Lov.
Then I see men sometimes feel your wounds as well as we. But I pray beware left in the end we may all rue some unlucky thrust.


Lag.
These Duels (Madam) I must confesse, are businesses of dan|ger enough; but that is a thing which he that values his honour and reputation, must not entertain a thought of. But yet at the first, I must needs say, they seemed somewhat strange; but now me thinks they are nothing, I look upon them as a meer Exercise; I cannot scarce eat a Dinner with a good appetite until I have fought one: They clearly save me forty shillings a Month unto my Fencing Ma|ster.


Lov.
Were I but now disposed to be merry. Aside.


Cris.
But I pray let me perswade you out of them.


Lag.
'Tis impossible (Madam); for he that stands upon his pun|ctillio's, must needs run into them every day. I have fought two this wek already, tomorrow I am to fight a third, and I look for a Chal|lenge to another every minute.


Lov.
Why, for Gods sake Sir?


Lag.
I was yesterday (Madam) in the Afternoon at the Divel Ta|vern, there hapned to be some words exchanged between a Gentle|man and my self; as I remember, he called me, Empty prating Cox|comb: Upon that (Madam) by the rule of Honour I could do no lesse then give him the Lye; I expected then that he would have singled me out, and have wispered somewhat in my ear, but the ignorant fellow nothing but flung a quart pot at my head, and kicked me down the stairs.


Cris.
Why, was not that enough?


Lag.
No (Madam) the affront doth yet lye clearly on his side, it was so resolved afterwards at the Golden-fleece.


Cris.
Me thinks that is somewhat strange.


La.
Not at all, Madam, for the Lye is the highest affront that can be given, and so is the French mode, for once Franois de Valois, the French King, upon an affront that Charles the Emperor put upon him, sent him a Challenge, in which he gave him the Lye; the Emperor refusing to answer him, the French ever since in Complement to their King have esteemed it the highest affront that can possibly be put upon a man.


Lov.
But how came you off in the other Duels you said you have fought?


Lag.
Very well, Madam: for the first it was a businesse of nothing;

for at the very first pas I disarmed my Adversary, and I not seeking af|ter bloud, but the Vindication of my Honour, was content to receive reasonable satisfaction, the acknowledgment that he had done me wrong, and so forth. Some body knocks.


Cris.
Who is that at the door?


Lag.
But the other was like to have proved transcendently more periculous: for (Madam) I stood upon my Guard thus. Drawes.


Cris.
Blesse us!


Lag.
This (Madam) is Prince Ruperts Guard, He came feroci|ously upon me with a Passado or two, which I putting off, run at him just thus, as my Lord Shandos killed Compton. Crisis squeeks

Enter Knowwel.

Know.
Villain! Draw upon a woman!He takes away his sword.


Lov.
Hold Sir, he is but in jest.


Know.
In jest!


Lag.
He knowes it is against the Mode to make a quarrel among Ladies.


Know.
The Mode, you Coxcomb! Beats him, La-gul runs out, Know-wel followes, and presently returnes again, Bud goeth out after Lagul.


Know.
Well let him go, for he is an Asse I'm sure, and so he ever will be, therefore it were a folly for to trouble my self any more with him.


Lov.
He can fight I see, although he cannot talk. Aside.


Cris.
Now, Sir, I am not altogether of your mind; though the Gentleman (I must confess) doth appear absurd enough, my Cozen and I though, are not altogether out of hopes in time to make him a lit|tle more understand himself, somewhat I think we have done al|ready.


Know.
It is impossible, Lady, except you should alter the Fabrick of his mind, unbend its appetite, or give it new desires; for as long as the divine soul creating breath, is clad with different disposing matter, and cast in several moulds, there will be Wise and Fooles.


Cris.
Sir, if he were a natural Fool, I should yeeld much to your opinion, but in my mind his chiefest unhappiness is, only to have set his mind on some odd fancies, which if we could perswade him out of, he would be (at the least) not ridiculous.


Know.
Lady, 'tis likely you may know him a great deal better then I, for, I must confesse, althogh he be one that I see almost every day in the streets, yet of all men living I have the least acquaintance with him: wherefore (Madam) if you please to make my knowledge to be so far indebted to you, as to let me a little more fully understand him, I shall take it as no mean favour.


Cris.
That Sir would be a very tedious task.


Lov.
A tedious task! Why, what have you to do, I wonder?


Know.
That question I think may not be unnecessarily put to a

Lady that is drest, and hath dined, as I suppose you have.


Cris.
Well Cozen, if you will help me, I will venture on it then. And to begin, Sir this Gentleman (as I have said) although he doth appear ridiculous enough, yet in my opinion not so much by nature as unlucky chance: for as when some common metals will serve for good substantial use, yet if you strive to force them to more curious shapes, they only such rude draughts will take as will render them more deformed: So this Gentleman (had his courser soul but had the luck to have acted in some downright way, to have managed some plod|ding Trade) he might by long experience have understood himselfe within his Sphere; nay, have had wit enough to have got a good E|state, and through the repute of that, have been look'd upon by the world as wise; but this by his fathers industry being left to his hand, the common course of the world, unhappily doth fling him upon things fit only for more refined minds; which although he cannot master, yet some odde grudges and imperfect stamps have transformed him from what he was, nor can he be what he would.


Lov.
So (Sir) that some laugh at him, some wonder, as one would at some monstrous thing; some, indigested vain attempt of Na|ture.


Cris
And first Sir, his Fortunes enabling him to keep variety of company; he hears indeed all sorts of wit enough, but that being a thing too subtile for his soul, naught stayes with him, but some few words and phrases, which he rudely plucking from that natural chaine that linck'd them with appropriating circumstances, shew very strange|ly.


Know.
Not much unlike (Lady) the relicks of those species, which (although in a methodick way, and by the discursive hints of thought are represented to the mind, yet) in a dream appear with casual conse|quence, the fancie making absurd contradictions, whilst at one act it doth rethink things treasured up in different time and place.


Cris.
Right Sir; for with some conceited speech, he is your Ser|vant; what e're you answer, on he goeth to what is next in hs me|mory.


Lov.
Me thinks he sometimes puts me in mind of the Discourse between Clarangeus and Alidon, what e're Alcidon answered, Cla|rangeus went still on with the story of his woodden window.


Cris.
But Sir, it is with Complements as with all things else, except they beget one another, they are quickly at an end.


Lov.
His tongue indeed like the Germane Clockwork at Bartholmew Fair, is wound up but for a season.


Cris.
You would take him for Fryer Bacons head, made only to speak some certain sentences.


Lov.
It may be so: for I must confesse, for the most part, he doth use strange, high, and conjuring words; nor do I think his face wants brass.



Cri.
Conjuring! You shall have him Court his Mistris, as if she were a Lady in some inchanted Castle. to be won with certain strange Ceremonies and mystical speeches.


Lov.
When he i quite spent, he is wont to cry, O Lord. tel you, You are melncholy; but that we have almost laughed him out of; for now with some fond protestation, he will say somewhat, which in effect shall be only a denyal of what you say.


Cris.
A little better then the Canterburry Fidler, that would still cry, You lye Sir.


Lov.
Then he will talk somewhat of Newes, or of the Weather, tell you it hath not rained of late; some common places of the cryed up Wits and Beauties of the Towne, with certain formula's of cen|sure on them all, may a little prolong his Discourse.


Cris.
O if a Horse-Race chance to be, it serves in no small stead, (believe me) it will keep him in good talk for at the least a week.


Lov.
You know, Cozen, what a stir he uses to keep sometimes with Trigunnel and his Mare.


Cris.
But that which is his greatest labour, and which most per|plexeth him to attain, as the only thing which in his judgment renders him right Gallant and most complete, is the punctilio Discourse, the Laws of Duel and the Sword.


Lov.
He thinks that if he could go handsomly through with a quar|rel without receiving a baffle, according to these Laws, he hath done more, and hath got more honour and repute then e're Montross, the Sweden King or Scanderbag.


Know.
Doth Fury know a Rule? Anger a Law? Strange Tyranny is this, that thus doth passions aw! Great spirits know your wrongs, can you whose actions might deter|mine what is Valour, whose looks might daunt a fashion, and outstare the Mode, whose names might make your deeds, though interferring ustome, regular? Can you (I say) be governed by the paltry by|lawes of a Taverne? Shall Honour, that Spring of worthy minds, that just Reward of Courage, Pains or Art, be measured by the dictates of a Crue able to degenerate the word, make it a term for Cowards, or a talk to busie fooles; a thing, a well tempered mind e're long will scarce dare own. As I have known a man whose spotlesse life would seem to question Adams fall, yet would he startle at the name of Godly, Saint or Holy. But Lady, I doubt I have too much interrupted you.


Lov.
Not a whit, Sir.


Cris.
There is not a quarrel about the Town, but he labours to get the exact History of it; he will tell you its rise and growth, who gave the first affront, and where it last did lye; together with the judicious observations of the Sword men on it.


Lov.
Then he hath strange Romances too of his own Adventures;

there is no Scout, Gazet or Weekly Intelligence will furnish you with more improbabilities. Captain Iones was but a meer Asse to him.


Cris.
I, for yesterday me thought, he told a story that went beyond his wounding the man in the Air.


Know.
What was that, I pray Lady?


Cris.
Why Sir, he said, as he was coming from Hide Park, there was five Bailiffes beset his Coach, which he routed; but with what do you think?


Know.
With his sword; what else?


Cris.
No Sir, it was but a Ladies busk, that he said he had in his hand.


Lov.
A pretty Instrument, and much in fashion with him of late.


Cris.
He gives one (Hadland, I think they call him) fifty pounds a year to keep him company.


Lov.
That is, sometimes to countenance him, and keep him from a Baffle.


Know.
Hadland! Certainly I have heard of that same Gentleman.


Cris.
'Tis possible, Sir, for he is one of no lesse ame then worth, although his decayed fortunes sometimes force him on unhandsome shifts.


Lov.
Is not that he you said to day Mrs. P. hath been so much in love with?


Cris.
The very same; he is one of the chief of our modern Hectors.


Lov.
Hectors?


Cris.
This 'tis to be so long in the Country; Do you not know what I mean?


Lov.
Not I.


Cris.
Why I mean a certain Order, more famous then that of Mal|ta, the Garter, Saint Esprit, or the Golden-fleece, a race of Adventurers, who, out of what strange humor I cannot tell, have usurped the name of that famous Trojane Prince.


Kn.
A Prince! a Pander, a fellow was kill'd in the quarrel of a whore.


Cr.
And afterwards, Sir (as I have heard) dragged at a Carts tail.


Lov.
Believe me, a very proper patron.


Cris.
But whether is your Cozen gone?


Know.
The little Gentlewoman, Lady, went out presently after Mr. La-gul.


Lov.
Poor silly Girle! She cannot though but put me in mind of my own folly, for (I must confesse) when I was of her years, I did not a little admire this same Gentleman; but a little time did teach me more wit.


Cris.
Yet still you did retain him though


Lov.
Why such a one for some businesses, I will assure you, will not do amisse.


Cris.
I must confesse, for a walk or such a matter he may be as re|quisite as the Satin-peticoat.



Lov.
And, believe me, I think a handsome young Gentleman, his hair neatly curled and powdered, sitting beside one in the boot of a Coach with his hat in one hand, may become the Coach as well, and be as necessary an appurtenance, as the rich Scarlet Livery, or the plu|med Lacqueyes; and for treatments and such kind of things, you do not know the pleasure such a one may do.


Cris.
But Cozen, you are well enough served, for I have heard that he will talk a little mystically sometimes; what, do you think men are fools, spend their money for nothing?


Know.
Well, Ladies, my knowledg is not a little engaged to you as to this Gentleman.


Cris.
Truly Sir not much, no more then it would have been to a day or twoes acquaintance with him.


Know.
But (Lady) I had almost forgot, how stand your resolutions for to night?


Cris.
If you please Sir, I shall be ready at eight a clock.


Know.
Lady, 'Tis a thing that company much improves.Where|fore if you please.


Cris.
I, I, she shall come.


Lov.
Sir, 'Tis well you used that Argument, for I must confesse, all that I can do in company is but to adde to the number.


Know.
What must I say then? I have e'en pull'd an old house on my head. Aside.
Your further acquaintance (Madam) may furnish me with better Ar|guments; but, me thinks though, to help to increase a number is none of the worst things a fair Lady is good for. Well (Ladies) seeing you do intend to meet, I must go and take some order about things. But stay, what shall I do with this same sword?


Lov.
Sir, if you please to leave it with me, I will see it restored.


Know.
I shall rely upon you(Lady) to do it. Gives it her. Exit.


Cris.
How now Cuz? What thinkest thou? What, is he a fool?


Lov.
I must needs say, I was a little deceived in him. But stay, this Mr. Lagul is as fit a man as I could possibly have thought of, and my having his sword, will give me a good opportunity to crave this courtesie of him. I will go therefore and find him out as soon as I can. Aside. Exit.


Cris.
alone. Happy you nobler substances that purely do impart what ever images your minds do form, and ca transfer your thought re|sembling species, without the abuse of this adulterating matter; mat|ter that our souls doth dresse in such disguising garbs; Don't Educa|tion, Custom and long use disfigure us enough? A few distant leagues making us to stare at one another as at some monstrous things: Will not the state fucus, and the holy Varnish serve, with all Arts antick Wardrobe, but that each soul must wear a natural mask, and such improving glosses and allaying dashes, take from the nice sitting of this

clayie Suit. Some whose flashy airy souls (if by judgment grasp'd) like air come to nothing, yet meeting with strange happy accidents, with a slye fallacy deceive even sober minds; each action drawes atten|tion, and each word regard; Their talk, though vain and empty, some odd, I know not whats, doth so become and grace, that the de|ceived fancy (as when one looks through some false mediums or abu|sing Opticks) cannot but conceit strange shapes of Wit, which else would not appear. But this same Gentleman, (had not his better Fortune enforced my notice with a little acquaintance) I had o're passed him as one of the common things of the world, but now, me thinks, I do begin to see a glimmering worth, though muffled with dis|advantages. Exit.

The end of the first Act.



ACT II.

SCENE I.
Enter Lagul and Lovewit.

Lag.
I Run him through the arme.


Lov.
Who, I pray Sir?


Lag.
The Gentleman I was talking of that I fought with.


Lov.
Cry Mercy, I had almost forgot You were indeed a little interrupted in your story.


Lag.
I, did you ever see so rude absurd a fellow, to make such a businesse before Ladies? But that you protected him, Madam.


Lov.
We have told him of his fault, Sir.


Lag.
Had not I been more knowing in my punctilio's, we might have been the Town talk for this month.


Lov.
He doth begin to see his Error.


Lag.
He shall else: Is his name Knowel, say you? And doth he lodg in Chancery-lane?


Lov.
I think I heard him say so.


Lag.
Stay, to morrow I must meet at Maribone Park.


Lov.
What do you mean? the Gentleman hath sent you your Sword, and by me doth crave your pardon, which I did oblige my self to get.


Lag.
This is as base as before he was uncivil; what doth he take me for a foot-boy, or a Porter, that I should put up an affront so? No (Madam) my Honour and Reputation is engaged; I am a Gentleman, and must have the satisfaction of a Gentleman.


Lov.
Nay, I pray Mr. Lagul.


Lag.
O God (Madam) Honour is the life and soul of a Gentleman,

it gives him being, it is the very heart and vital heat that makes him act and move, and can no more endure a wound. But (Madam) I must take my leave of you, for I have engaged to meet at the Horne Taverne at three a clock, and now I think it is somewhat past.


Lov.
Are you going thither? You may then do me a small courtesie.


Lag.
Madam, I do esteem my self incomparably felicitous that my stars are so benigne as to make me capable of doing you any ser|vice.


Lov.
Sir, I had best to let you rest in that opinion until I have an opportunity to requite you.


Lag.
Madam, I am your most eternal Bond-slave to do whatsoever you shall please to imperate.


Lov.
I am (Sir) so much the more engaged.


Lag.
Upon my Reputation (Madam) I do not conceive so.


Lov.
So now he hath done. Aside.


Lag.
But (Madam) what is that you would have me do?


Lov.
You say (Sir) you are going to the Horn Tavern, there is a Gentleman there, one Mr. Welbred.


Lag.
He that invited us last night?


Lov.
The very same


Lag.
He hath not affronted her, I hope, she would not have me fight with him. Aside.


Lov.
Only (Sir) there was a Letter I brought out of the Country for him, I quite forgot to give it him the last night; but if you please to do me the favour to deliver it.


Lag.
I am glad it is no more. Aside.
'Tis my ambition (Madam) to be subservient to you. But where is my Sword?


Lov.
If you please to walk in (Sir) you shall have it. Exeunt.



SCENE II.
Enter Slur and Caster.

Cast.
Come this is the fairer Room, it looketh towards the street.


Slur.
I, so it doth, we might have been here all this while.


Cast.
Well, if this businesse succeed, now


Slur.
Succeed I Will death succeed to life, the day to night? It can|not but succeed: 'Slid, old Oughthred never did demonstrate a conse|quence so certain, as I could this.


Cris.
But if he should prove an angry boy though, be mortal and wound unto the death.


Slur.
Come fear nothing, I'l warrant he is as arrant a Coward, as e|ver wore broad silver Belt.



Cast.
Pray God he be.


Slur.
There is another Youth too of the same breed above, I dare swear, I do not think but much good might be done upon him.


Cast.
But prethee let us make an end with one first.


Slur.
But I wonder what Hadland ailes, to make us stay thus long.


Cast.
He said he would be here almost an hour ago.


Slur.
 take his milksop pocky face, for me.


Cast.
That pocky face shall pay for it, if thou wilt.


Slur.
Shall us jeere the Rogue, and make him mad, as we use to do?


Cast.
I have this night studied some new matter for his purled taffeta countenance.


Slur.
But take heed you do not provoe him unto fury.


Cast.
I'll warrant you: do you think I do not know the man? But stay, I think he comes yonder.


Slur.
I, there he is, but I do not see the Gentleman that he said he would bring with him; Enter Hadland.
Come, you are a trusty Card in faith Dick, did not you promise upon your word you would be here an hour ago?


Had.
Promise upon my word, quoth the man! What dost thou take me for a Scrivener, that I should mind such things as words and promises?


Cast.
A Scrivener! No, Dik, I do not think thou art a Scrivener: but yet I must tell you, thy face doth look not much unlike the blank side of a Bond.


Slur.
Not quite so smooth, in my opinion.


Cast.
Come you shall contrive no more of these stratagems, if you can look no better upon them.


Had.
The truth of it is, I did a little disorder my selfe the last night.


Cast.
Disorder thy self! Why? what didst thou go to bed without being drunk?


Slur.
At nine a clock without a Wench?


Cast.
No that he did not, if the Madam in Lincolnes-Inne-fields say true. What sait thou Dick?


Had.
Why, I hope you are not my Ghostly Father.


Cast.
No Dick, I think thou lookest a little more Ghostly of the two.


Slur.
An absolute Ghost, I vow: had he but a Surplice and a Torch, he needs no Chalk.


Cast.
Chalk! he looks like any.


Had.
Come out with all thy paltry old Similies, and then we shall have done. What is it, Ashes, tallow Candle, Greene Cheese?


Cast.
Well, Green Cheese let it be then, if thou wilt: but

if thy face be a Green Cheese, the Cheese-cloth was somewhat course.


Slur.
Why prethee?


Cast.
Because the coat is so rugged.


Slur.
Why Dick? But what if it be a Candle?


Cast.
What if it be a Candle! Was there ever such a question heard of? Why dost thou not kick him Hadland? he asks, What if thy face be a tallow candle?


Slur.
He will give me leave to put the case I hope, I do but sup|pose.


Cast.
Well then, suppose it were a candle: stay why then I say, it would be a Christmasse on.


Slur.
I, for it is all wrought crinckum, cranckum.


Had.
Come, the face is a face, and may be a face.


Cast.
It may be (I grant) when it is finished.


Slur.
Finished!


Cast.
I, for yet i is but rough cast.


Had.
Come, 'tis no matter what the face is, or how it looks, I am ure if it had not been for him that ows the face, you might have both looked like Asses ere this.


Cast.
As we did the other night when the Sussex Genleman beat us.


Had.
Was not I the man, who when we were quite blowne up by those same City Rogues: And we had been in three dayes consultati|on whether we should turne brethren of the High-way, down right beggars, or hang our selves: Was not I the man (I say) that found out this same Youth, this precious Squire, of whom within this week we have won some ninescore pounds, besides the expectation of this business?


Slur.
Well, for my part (I say) the man speaks reason, and ought not to be so abused.


Cast.
Yes, one touch more.


Slur.
Come, out with it then, man.


Cast.
I say, if we had turned brethren of the High-way, as he said, he for his part might have robbed without a Handcher|chief.


Slur.
Why, prethee now


Cast.
One would take h face for a piece of Holland.


Slur.
It must be purled then.


Had.
Come, are you not ashmed to abuse yor brother Hector thus?


Cast.
You a Hector?


Had.
What am I else?


Cast.
That wan pale sprightls thing drw Prims curtin in the mid of night, and told him half his Troy was burnt.


Slur.
O Lord, why Dick what sai tou?



Had.
Why this Dick sayes, And first for you, you Rascal, Do you remember what you were when first I knew thee? a lean, starv'd, thin-gut, thred-bare Rogue, that had never a rag to cloath thy body, nay, scarce a body to thy soul: Do you remember where I found you? Clapt up in the Fleet for forty shillings, that thou owedst in Ram-Alley for chippings of bread and porrage, when thou, Camelion like, hadst for some dayes lived by nothing but aire, and wert just re|solving into thy first principles? Did not I pay this dribling debt for thee, set thee free, and since have made thee the man thou art? I must confesse, I saw a good hopeful cozening countenance in thee, that did promise much.


Cast.
Come, a truce, a truce.


Had.
No you Rogues, since you have provoked me, you shall re|pent it. And as for you my friend, with you I have been somewhat longer acquainted, I think I knew thee in the late Wars, thou went'st by the name of Captaine, a thing could do nothing but drink and damne thy self, and run away, so monstrous a Coward, that thy pro|digious fears were able to work upon the genius of an Army; And this you shall confesse, or else I will beat it out of you.


Cast.
Well, hold, I do confesse here before my friend then, that I am a Coward, and thou art a terrible child of war; so thou wilt let me alone, thou shalt be no more Dick Hadland, but a furious Hector or Achilles, any thing what thou wilt: thy pock holes shall be no more pock holes, but skars of dreadful Mars.


Slur.
Why Dick?


Cast.
Characters of honour in which may be read full mighty acts of Chivalry.


Slur.
Characters saist thou? 'tis some strange Oriental tongue; Stay, let's see, I think they are the Egyptian Hieroglyphicks.


Cast.
No 'tis Greek, for I think they are all Omegaes, Hadland.
Enter Drawer.


Draw.
Sir, There is a Gentleman below would speak with you.


Had.
With me? I'l warrant 'tis Mr. La-gul. Prethee desire him to come up.


Draw.
I will Sir. Exit Drawer.


Cast.
I must now vanish then. Exit Caster.


Had.
Stay, I will go meet him. Exit, and enters presently a|gain talking with La-gul.


Had.
Will you meet him, say you?


La.
What should I do else?


Slur.
Will he fight?


Had.
So he saith.


Slur.
So now you have made a fine business. Aside.


Had.
Come I'l warrant you, Aside. Come Mr. La-gul sit down, here is a health to all our friends in the other world, you will remem|ber

me to them all. Drinks to him.


La.
What do you mean?


Had.
You will meet him, you say.


La.
I shall be posted else: And I shall lose my honour and repu|tation.


Had.
I 'tis true, but


La.
But what?


Had.
'Slid, you had as good meet Iove armed with Thunder, the sheers of Atropos: the dart of death it self is not half so fatal as his Rapier.


La.
Say you so?


Had.
The Sword of Justice strikes not so certain; no fore man of a Ju|ry could breathe more sure destruction.


Slur.
If it be so, in my mind the Gentleman hath a great cause of comfort; fo to know the certainty of his death, is that which many a good Christian prayes for all his life long.


Had.
'Tis wel you put him in mind, for certainly it is time for him to begin to forsake the flesh, the world and the Divel.


Slur.
Some Ghostly Father indeed were fitter company for him then we.


Had.
No, no, Mr. La-gul, I say, drink on, it may be your last We will meet somewhere to morrow before you go, and sing a Psalm, and it will be well enough, I'll warrant you.


La.
Nay, but Mr. Hadland.


Had.
Come Mr. La-gul, to deal plainly and seriously with you, you have chanc'd upon a man that hath not his fellow, I am confident in the Kingdom; he is absolutely one of the greatest Duellifts about the Town.


Slur.
Prethee who is it, Mr. Hadland?


Had.
One Caster, as I take it, his name is


Slur.
Caster! I have heard indeed very much of the man, he came lately out of France.


Had.
I, the very same, he killed a great Monsieur there in a Duel the last Summer, and was pardoned by the King for the gallant service he did against the Spainiard at the siege of Arras.


Slur.
I believe he is fain to leave France now upon some such ac|count, I have heard somewhat.


Had.
Nay to my knowledg he hath killed some of our own fellow Subjects, but that he hath had the luck to carry things closely.


Slur.
The truth of it is, the Gentleman is a gallant spirited Gentle|man; but he hath one humour in his fighting that I do not so well like of.


Had.
What is that I pray, Sir?


Slur.
When once he is in the field he will make the utmost use of all advantages, he never spares any man.



Had.
I have heard that very thing disuted with him diver time, but he saith it is the only Mode byond se; crye, Vn enemy le min|dre.


Su.
But me thinks (Sir) that it doth not savour so much of magnanimity; true Valour shuld never think upon enemies in the way of fear.


La.
What should I do then, Gentlemen, in this case?


Had.
Nay, for my part, I cannot tell.


Slur.
Truly Sir, your condition in my opinion is somewhat desperate


Had.
This 'tis, when you will venture upon quarrels when I am not with you.


L.
Venture! I could not possibly avoid it, I did but deny to lend him forty pounds, and straight he called me base uncivil fellow; and told me I did not like a man of honour.


Had.
I think so; could you expect any other consequence? 'Slid, could any man have been guilty of such an uncivility?


La.
What, to deny a man I never saw before?


Had.
It was no matter, he looked like a Gentleman.


La.
Upon that (you know) I could do no lesse then give him the Lye, and so the businesse began. For my part, I thought I might safely have done so, for I am sure I saw a Gentleman beat him not above an hour before.


Had.
Beat him!'Slid, Slur, what shall I say? What a Rogue is this he did not tell us of it? Aside In some cases, you know, one is not bound to strike again by the rule of Honour; as if I have given the Lye, or so.


La.
No, there was no such matter here, for the Gentleman was at play with him, when on the sudden he told him he was a Cheat, and gave him a blow on the pate with a Candle|stick.


Had.
And did he do nothing, say you? Pox what shall I say?Aside


La.
No, nothing.


Slur.
You cannot tell what new Mode of quarrelling he may have brought over with him from France?


Had.
Strike him! if there be not some such matter in it, he had as good have strooke fire into a Magazine.


La.
Well then, I am resolved.


Had.
What to do?


La.
I will not fight.


Had.
How! Not fight!


La.
No.


Slur.
Nay, now we have over done the businesse. Aside


Had.
Prethee have but a little patience, Aside. What do you say? Will you not fight! Speak it againe, for I cn scarce believe my ears.



La.
I say, I will not fight.


Had.
What is all the paines that I have taken with you lost? Will you with one act forfeit all your Honour?


La.
Honour! hang it, I am almost weary of it.


Slur.
Do not you value your reputation?


La.
I cannot tell what to do, it doth every day so endanger my life.


Had.
Your life? Can there be a life without it? To live to be the scorn of men, is worse then a hundred deaths. Can he be said to live, that is not fit company for a Foot-boy, that will be howted and laugh+d at, and posted for a Coward?


La.
I care not, let them post me; it is but going into the Country for a while, or giving out that I am gone to travel, as you know one did not long ago in such a case.


Had.
No, that will not do, for you would as soon avoid your own shadow as him, no troubled conscience could more closely pursue you, divine Justice would not so soon ind out the wicked as he would you: 'Slid, 'twas but the last Summer he followed from France, quite through Germany, into Italy, one that he had never seen, neither had the least affront past betwixt them, meerly out of a generous humour, because he heard he was a man of Armes.


La.
What shall I do then?


Had.
Come, Mr. La-gul, the truth of it is, your Quarrel was not an hour old before I heard of it; and I being extremely sensible of your danger, began to think how I might possibly procure your safety, at the last came into my mind a Gentleman, one that is an intimate friend of this same Casters, whom I have some acquaintance with. And to be short, I did a little feel him, to see whether he would be a means of ta|king up this matter, but


La.
What?


Had.
Why, to be short, he I believe hath heard that you are a man of Estate, and he it seems hath had an ill hand of late, and is a little out of money, and so he thinks to take an advantage of this opportunity to request a courtesie of you.


La.
What, would e borrow any money?


Had.
He talked as if he wanted 200.


La.
200 l. I cannot Sir by no means, you know how much I have lost of late.


Had.
That is all one, he knows your credit is good; and if you should deny him this small favour, he is somewhat a humoursome fellow, and I cannot tell whether ever I should perswade him to serve you in this same businesse; and yet I know he is the only man that can do it.


La.
I could spare now some twenty pounds, what if I offered to give him so much outright? would not he rather have it, do you think?


Had.
By no means. 'Slid, What? offer to give a Gentleman mo|ny?

for ought I know he might take it for an affront, and then there would be another business.


La.
An affront say you! nay, I will take heed how I run into any more of these affronts;  But if there be no remedy, I shall referre my self unto you in this same matter.


Had.
I will do my utmost endeavour to see what can be done then.  But what quarrel was that you were a telling me you fell into this afternoone?


La.
Why there was a rude, uncivil fellow abused me; but because it was in the company of some Ladies, I let him alone; but I believe I must challenge him. 


Had.
Why, what was the matter, for Gods sake?


La.
Why this same Gentleman (I know not for what cause) on the sudden fell upon me, and took away my sword.


Had.
I hope not so: Would you let him take away your sword?


La.
How could I avoid it, except I had made a quarrel before the Ladies, and that you know I must not do.


Had.
O excuse me Sir: In your own defence you might.


La.
Might I in mine own defence, say you?  That I had but known so much!  Well, but what is to be done as the case now stands?


Had.
As the case now stands, you cannot challenge him, for a man in Honour is supposed to have but one sword.


La.
That is pritty, I vow.  That I could but think on these things my self!  But he hath restored me to my sword again.


Had.
Nay, then you must, for he hath restored you to your former condition.  But stay, upon what terms did he give it you? What said he?


La.
He said nothing to me, for he sent it by a Lady.


Had.
A Lady! I cannot tell how that same circumstance may alter the matter.  Stay Mr. Slurre, here is a pretty case, a Gentleman is dis-armed, and then the party that dis-armed him, snds him his sword again by a Lady; what do you think of it?


Sl.
What say you Sir? A Gentleman is dis-armed, and then his sword is sent him again by a Lady?


Had.
I, that is (as I take it) the case.


La.
I, that is the case.


Sl.
Why then the first thing that will be considerable is, wheher the Law of Honour takes notice of a Lady; for you know Sir all Lawes look on some persons, as in Iure nuas.


Had.
But in my opinion, thereafte s she may be qualified, the Law of Honour may take notice of her.


La.
As how I pray, Sir?


Had.
Was there ever blood drawn in her quarrel?


Sl.
then there may arise a question, whether that blood were drawn in the field, or no?



Had.
You say true.  This I see will be somewhat a difficult case; wherefore (I think) we had best to stay till night, when we may have the opinion of all our brethren.


La.
Well, I see there is somewhat in these Lawes, if I could but un|derstand them.


Had.
Somewhat doe you say? they are beyond what Solon or Lycurgus ever made.


Sl.
If you be not knowing in these, although you were more vali|ant then Hercules, you might be resolved a Coward.


Had.
Were Iohn of Gaunt now living, one of our subtil Duell Casuists would baffle him with a qurk.


Sl.
Turn the affront upn him cleerl, in despight of his sword and buckler.


La.
Well, I must leave you, for I have a little business with a Gen|tleman that is above. 
But Mr. Handland, do you think this Gentleman would take it as an affront, if I should offer to pay he reckoning?


Had.
I cannot tell, you had best to leave some mony with mee.


La.
Your servant Sir, I shall think my self super-eminently happy in your farther acquaintance; and therefore I shall not be a little ambitious of it.


Sl.
Sir, I shall prevent your desires.


L.
I could wish that I had but the felicitous fortune to be any way subserviceable to you.


Sl.
I shall esteem it no mean honour to be your servant.


La.
Really Sir, I presume you think not so. Exit.


Sl.
Well, go thy way, God send thee more wit, and me more mony, as they use to say.


Had.
Mony you rogue! What would you have? Have we not now 200 pounds? Two hundred pounds! me thinks it sounds very roundly; but that we have forsworth it, we might go purchase Manors, you Rogue, Lands and Tenements.


Sl.
take your Lands and Tenements, give me an Asse with a thousand pounds a year, 'is the only revenue in the world, it comes in cleare without any taxes.


Had.
But if we go on thus, I know no reason but that they should rate us to the poor of the parih for him:


Sl.
Such a lad indeed is a frank tenement that Plowden never dreamt of.


Had.
A frank-tenement! A fee-simple rather.


Sl.
Two or three such youths, a I live, if I had but a mind to marry, were a joynture sufficient for a lass of a thousand pounds.


Had.
Why, there is another, just such a one, in my conscience, not far off.


Sl.
I remember you were speaking some such matter to day.


Had.
Nay, I have enquired more of him since, and I hear he has at

the least fifteen hundred pound a year, besides some good summs in his purse.


Slur.
Such a one, my boy, might be worth our notice: but what shall we do to him?


Had.
Faith, e'en modo quo pris.


Slur.
Nay hold, all men are not aike: Slid, he may be terrible and valiant, a child of courage and the sword.


Had.
Dost take me for a Fool or an Asse? Do you think I do not know mens tempers? He cannot in nature but be a Coward. Did I not see him the other day with a cp but|toned up on one side, and a Feather in it, upon a horse with a geat saddle, at Hide Park? besides, did I not hear him to day talk of his Ho|nour and Reputation?


Slur.
They are shrewd signs, I must cofse.


Had.
Come, let it happen as it will, I will take the businesse upon my self; and let the worst come to the worst, he shall not have a child to deal with.


Slur.
Spoke like a Hector, and thy self, brave Hadland. But stay, shall I go call Caster, and tell him of our suc|cesse?


Had.
Hold: Shal we fright the Rogue a little, and make him believe he must fight?


Slur.
It will be rare, I vow. But here he comes.

Enter Caster.

Cast.
How now, my Lads? What is the matter you look thus sober? How go affairs?


Had.
Faith, e'en scurvily enough.


Cast.
Why? He will not fight? Wil he?


Slur.
Fight! He was ready to fight with us two but for asking him the question.


Had.
Fight, do you say! He was got, I think, betwixt two furious Armies in the heat of Charge: he thinks, he speaks, he talks of nothing else but fighting.


Slur.
In the while that he was here with us, but that we carried our selves discreetly, he would have given us twenty occasions of the Challenge


Had.
I looked out after him, and I saw his Sword out twice, meerly upon some triflng businesse, of a justle, or the wall.


Slur.
We have a great deliverance I think: for my part, I never was in the company of such a furious terrible boy since the hour I was borne.


Cast.
Come I am confident ou did not your parts handsomly; you did not fright him enough.


Had.
Fright him, say you! I am sure I made thee such a

dreadful thing, that I dare swear, hadst thou but heard me, thou wouldest have beene afraid of thy selfe this twelve month.


Slur.
But that was so far from frighting of him, that it wrought an effect quite contrary, in stirring up a noble emulation in him: he swore such a one as I described thee to be, he would go through the world bu he would find out.


Had.
He blessed himselfe, that at the length he had the luck to to light upon one, in whom his sword might find some re|sistance, or in whose death he might gaine some honour.


Cst.
 Take you (Hadland) this was your do|ings.


Had.
Nay, prethee be not angry, I for my part did all for the best.


Cast.
The best! Hang you, you knew it could not be o|therwise.


Had.
Nay, do not judge of a businesse by the successe.


Cast.
What do you think I shall do now?


Slur.
In troth I cannot tell, Now the matter is so far gone there is no flying off, you must e'en go through.


Cast.
What? Would you have me fight?


Had.
Why not?


Cast.
Do you ask why? You know it is against my nture: fight (quoth you!) I tremble at the very word.


Slur.
Alas poor man!


Had.
Come, come, e'en fight, and if thou chance to fall, I will see thee honourably buried on the common stock.


Slur.
Fight! What wouldst thou do else? Hast thou not lived long enough?


Had.
I must confesse, if I had been in his condition, I think I should have hanged my self some years ago.


Slur.
Hast thou not lived to spend a fair estate, that hth kept thy Ancestors in good repute for many ages?


Had.
Hat thou not lived by thy profane debauchnesse, and base cowardlinesse to help to sink a cause in which we all do suffer?


Slur.
Nay, now you are a little too serious, Dick.


Had.
Hang him, I would I could say any thing that would mad him, for jeering of my face.


Slur.
Nay, then have at him. What dost thou live for? but to be a Moth and Canker to thy Country?


Cast.
So 'tis well.


Slur.
To pervet and seduce her youth?


Cast.
O that my heart would but give me leave to fall upon either of these Rogues.
You dam'd Villains must you abuse me too? But there is no trfng in this matter; I must go see what may be pos|sibly done for to prevent it. Exit.


Slur.
Shall we call him back again?


Had.
No, let the Rascal alone in his fears until we meet anon at night.


Slur.
Well, here is a Health to the Rogue howsoever.


Had.
Come on: But you know whom we are to meet withal at night; we had not best to be too busie, for they are Lads we shall do no good upon, except we first drink them up pretty high.


Slur.
Well, as you will.
But what becomes of your business?


Had.
O things are in an excellent posture; what wil you say, if be|fore night I have my Land again?


Slur.
'Tis impossible.


Had.
Well, Do but mark the motions, and observe conse|quences.


Slur.
But how can it be man, that thou shouldst ever make such an Asse of that old, wary, subtle fellow?


Had.
You are deceived in him, he is not so subtle as you think for; he is as fine a dull and stupid piece of matter as you would wish to work upon: I grant you, for this many ears he hath had the luck to be much imployed in his way. And although he never read Cook nor Perkins, yet I cannot tell by what conspiracy of the world, he hath been that way accounted very knowing, so that for this many years he has heaped up huge summes, and now I think is owner of some Two thousand Pounds per annum; through the repute of which Estate he hath beene lately made a Ju|stice.


Slur.
For all this, if thou bringest this about, thou wilt bee more fmous then he that cozen'd the Jew, the Jugler, and the Broker in Long-lane.


Had.
Well, do but go a long with me; and you shall know how all the matter is, for you have a part to act this Afternoon, which you must do before we meet them we promised. Exet.




SCENE III.
Enter Welbred and La-gul, Welbred
reading of a Letter.

Wel.
What should this mean?Aside.
Well (Sir) you will be pleased to tell you friend, I shall not fail at the appointed time: and place. You are not ignorant, I suppose, of the business.


La.
Sir?


Wel.
I say, I will not fail to meet him.


La.
Upon my honour (Sir) I cannot guess your meaning, I was only desired to deliver it unto you.


Wel.
You will know more then I believe; for certainly you are the friend he means to bring along with him.


La.
I the friend! Really, as I am a Gentleman, I do not appre|hend you.


Wel.
No? that is strange; why the Gentleman doth challenge me.


La.
'Sfoot, am I falling into another Del?


Wel.
But you say, you know nothing?


La.
Upon my reputation, not I.


Wel.
Well (Sir) Your Servat. I mst go find ot what this doth mean. Exit.


La.
Well, certainly in the end I shall be weary of this same Ho|nour, it is such a dangerous thing; I am no sooner out of the haz|zard of one quarrel, but straight I run into another; I cannot do a|nything, scarce move, or stir, or speak, but it is ready to bring me indanger of a Duel; one quarrel I fell into yesterday, another to day, and now they are drawing me into a third. Well, to prevent them, I will e'en take a Coach and go with my little new Mstresse to Hide Park as I promised her. Exit.



SCENE IV.
Enter Welbred solus.

Stay, Whether do I go? If I fight, what shall I hazard? My estate, my life, my soul; for (as I am taught) I shall offend as well the Lawes Divine, as Civil: If I do not, I shall be wounded in my ho|nour. My Honour I, what is that? for I must confesse (the word

of late hath been so abused, that) I scarce can tell. However, this I am sure of, that each man doth naturally addict himself to make a choice of some way gaining a repute with others; in which, if he receive a check, there is nothing can more undervalue him; hee being supposed to choose that in which he most excelled. I therefore, being a man of that condition, that doth pretend unto a sword, must run all hazards, rather then be foild in that.
Now tis true, one that hath employed his endeavours to rase a same another way, might passe over such a businesse as this, and perhaps it would not at all reflect on him.
But these kind of men are not competent Judges of what in us they call rash; for wee shall see, when any thing doth happen that doth concerne them in the way they have taken for to ac|quire a value and esteeme, They will act things as strange and inordinate: You shall have a man made up of meekenesse; A man, whose life and doctrine preacheth nothing else but patience and compliance unto others; yet he will venture for to end both Church and State, nay, tear the world in pieces, rather then yeeld himself worsted in one silly argument.
I must then fight!
Ha! What said I? fight!
Me thinks the word doth carrie horror in it; I may be kil'd, or (which is worse) I may kill.
However, 'tis an action scarce consistent with humanity; Yet, my unlucky fortune will force me on it; for were I one who already had satisfied the world of my courage, I might then perhaps pretend a conscience, yet preserve my honour.
But being as I am, a fresh and raw young man, whose deeds will be looked upon without the countenance of former actions, Conscience (I say) will appear but a lame and pitifull excuse. Exit.

The end of the second Act.




ACT III.

SCENE I.
Enter Know-well.

SHee has an acute and handsome wit, a judgment too, not usuall in a woman, then which there is nothing doth more touch my fancy; and yet, Shee wants not that which we call Beauty, that most divine proportion, that doth so lively strike our souls.
Nay, I needs must say, this was the only thing which at the first put me to a stop, and would not let me pass her over, as other common things: But now, a more noble Idea doth so fully represent it self, that I scarce feel its force at all; Nor doth it move me, more then those trivial petty ends, which in my childsh ignorance I have pursued, would now stirre me: Nor is this strange; for certainly, Beauty's chiefest (if not only) Empire, is at the first; but afterwards, it yeelds unto, and is regulated by what farther conversation doth produce. For, without doubt, had shee now all the deformity that age, or erring nature ever yet produced, I should make her my choice; and those impressions, that by the little acquaintance I have had with her, shee hath made in my mind, would so over-rule my fancy, that in despight of the world, I should account her faire. Exit.



SCENE II.
Enter Had-land and Slurre.

Slur.
Stay; yonder he comes.


Had.
Come, shal we go meet him?

Enter Wel-bred: Hadland and Slurre
meet him, and justle him.

Wel.
Why how now Sir? What is the matter?


Had.
 Do you ask questions?Hadland Strikes Wel-bred.


Wel.
Was ever man thus abused? I will dye a thousand times ra|ther then suffer this you base uncivil villain. 

Drawes, and so doth Had land and Slurre, they fight a
little while, and wound Wel-bred, and go away.

Wel.
They are gone, but yet they have left somewhat behind them; for I do bleed a pace; the heat they have put mee into, has bol'd my blood up unto that height, that it will all run over; well, I must goe get a Surgeon as soon as I can. Exit, and enters again.
It doth bleed more and more, and I begin to grow weak and faint;

The fatall hour doth certainly draw nigh; for me thinks I do begin to feel my life run out with my bloud. 
And now as when some impressions that the fancy doth by day receive, (other objects continually plying the sense) are not at all, or else but dully sensible, but at night appear more fresh then ever;
So, now me thinks, some odde kind of thoughts, which in the earnest pursuit of those things, my youth addicted me unto, I scarce did mark, (now I am going to my eternal rest) begin to stare upon me, and look somewhat strange. 
What a high piece of madnesse have I done, thus to lose my life about a trifle! I say, my life; that which is the chiefest good in nature, that to which all other goods are but subservient; nay, are not at all with|out it? What competent end then can any man propose in hazarding of it, since in all reason that for which we hazard should be of more value then that we hazard?
What dishonour had it been to me, if by my wife declining I had gi|ven some cause to think I had fear'd them, more then if in such case I had avoided a Beare or Oxe; for Honour, certainly, is nothing else but that respect and value that those things do draw, which buoy and prop one up in the world. Ths Wealth, Authority, good Friends and Knowledg, (furnishing us with those means by which the greatst actions are performed) must needs beget a reverence and esteeme: but the force of the body is (without doubt) the most inconsiderable thing possible; he that enjoyes the greatest share of it, how small a power doth he therby acquire? We see he must be subject to each petty Constable; nay, a dagger or a pistol makes the weakest equall to him: 'Tis true, those powerfuller arts of the more nobler part are to be honoured and admired. These many times with strange subtle|ties unite into one commanding power particular strengths, and being united, with as much cunning obtain its rule and Masterie. These flights we see, do make even weak, decrepit age, often formidable to and threfore honoured by the world. Had I this way imployed! But oh! he faints. Enter two men.


1.
Help, help the Gentleman.


2.
What, is he dead?


1.
Almost, I think: look how he is wounded!


2.
Me thinks I should know him: I, certainly he is a customer of my Masters, and he lodges in Chancery-lane.


1.
We had best then to carry him thither.


2.
Pull out his hand-kercheife to help stop the blood.

He pulls it out, and withall pulls out the
challenge La-gull gave him.

1.
Look, what is that? you had best to read it.


2.
What is this? I think it is a challenge.


1.
A Challenge! Jesu bless us; then it seems this was some duell:
Will these Gentleman never leave off these same scurvy Duells? 

But wee had best to make haste whilst he hath any blood left in him.

They carry him out.


SCENE II.
Enter Know-well and Mrs. Crisis.

Know.
I heard, Lady, that with much earnestnesse, he seem'd to enquire for me at my lodging; and therefore because I think I heard you say he would be here about this time, I came hither to see what he would have with me.


Cris.
The truth of it is, he appointed to come hither, and goe to Hide Park with me; but since he hath sent his man to desire me to ex|cuse him, because there was a businesse of consequence fallen out, that he was to go about.


Know.
Then all that I can say to it, is that he hath made me lose a little paines.


Cris.
And so truly he hath me, for I have been almost this houre a dressing myself, thinking to go with him.


Know.
That were a great deal of pity, Lady, that any paines you have taken should be in vaine; rather then so, if you will please to give me leave to wait upon you thither, although it be a place that I do but little frequent; yet Lady, upon this occasion, I shall not a little desire it.


Cris.
By no means Sir, I would not put you to that trouble.


Know.
Nay, if that be the only obstacle.


Cris.
I beseech you Sir. 


Know.
Come Lady, it is the first request I ever made to you, and I will not be denied.


Cris.
Nay, if you will not, I cannot tell what to say to it.

As they are going out, they meet her Father.

Old Cris.
And whither, and whither, I pray, in all this haste?


Cris.
Only a little way, Sir, with this Gentleman.


Old Cris.
A little way! And why am not I good enough to know?


Cris.
We were a going to Hide Park.


Old Cris.
To Hide Park? I thought it was some such place you were going to, you were so bedeck'd and trim'd up with all your Jin-com|bobs; wil you never leave following of these idle fashions? Come, stand out in the light a little. Hey da! What, powder'd and patch'd again? have not I time and time forbad you ever to do so? off with them, I say, those filthy blaines and scabs of pride,  off with them, or I will pull them off.


Know.
Nay, I beseech you Sir, with your pardon; I must needs say you are a little too severe, in not letting her please her fancy in these kind of things.



Old Cris.
Mr. Know-well, I ever have had that opinion of you, that I do not a little wonder, that you, of all men, should speak thus if you speak according to your Judgement.


Know.
Sir, for my part, I speak what I think; for certainly, you have little reason to blame her thus.


Old Cris.
Reason? though to her my will is reason sufficient; yet I would not have you believe that I speak without a cause. For do you think it doth become a sober, civil, modest Virgin, as I hope shee is, to follow all the several fashions, those fantastick changes, and whim|sical dances led by the vain and empy part of the world?


Know.
Sir, for my part I could wish our habits were as constant as the course of nature, nor that we had more change of dress then birds or trees; but this I can but wish; for we see the generall humour of the world ever yet has been so set upon the contrary, that one can scarce discreetly hope it; nay, hee that would but a little strictly enquire and search into our natures, and mark how prone and apt they are for variety and change, might almost demonstrate its impossibility; for certainly, as long as in the world there are men of severall qualities and degrees, the inferiour, and more base will imitate the waies of those of better ranke, and strive to intrench upon, and gaine their customes; which being no sooner got by the one, but the other will despise them, and seek for new. Seeing then these alterations are so unavoidable, without doubt, it wil more become one in a moderate way to yeild unto, then vainely to oppose them. For whatsoever the riged do pretend, there is nothing can more argue a fan|tastick humor, or self-conceited pride, then with ones single whimseys to oppose what is received by the generality.


Old Cris.
'Tis true Sir, I needs must yeeld thus far, for I should condemn her of the height of folly, should shee oppose the general use in things that are indifferent: but that I chiefly blame her is, for certaine knacks and fashions, which although in common use and custome, yet not being decent and comely in themselves, must needs be unlawfull.


Know.
That, Sir, is impossible; for custome is the very square and rule of what is decent, and what not; indecency being nothing else but that harsh discord that any thing doth make, if it doth chance to inter|fere with the common course of things, and certainly, the soundest judg|ments wil not hold any habit to be simply in its self unlawfull. Thus much, indeed, must be granted, that some attires, by being first used by (and therefore being reckoned for the badges of) the vainer and more fantastick sort, may from them acquire some accidentall scandall, which afterwards (they growing into use, with the sober and more staid) by the same reason they must needs mew and let fall.


Old Cris.
This Sir, is somewhat strange; for although I cannot tel to what narrow limits you may confine the word decency in its strictest notion, yet there is nothing more certain then that there are vain, light, 

immodest habits, of their proper nature abstracted from all those glosses that custome may flng on them.


Know.
Truly Sir, I think not, nor I believe will you, if you but consider the businesse a little more; for vanity is nothing else but the affectati|on of the signes of those things we really have not; as in attires, if the aged do usurp what doth belong to youth, the poor to the rich, the in|feriour to the more Nble. Now Sir, what is it that doth define to each of these their severall Characterizing Gabes, but use and arbitrary Custome? And so farre is any habit in it self from representing what is grave or light, that should it please Om|nipotence, (as there is nothing impossible) but to invert the com|mon course of Nature, make those the markes of age, which are now of youth; the smooth chin would then be as reverend, as is now the bald head; Then should you have the grave and venerable slver haires bee worne in amorous wanton Bracelets. Nay, nothing in this kinde, but as to these respects, would have its alte|ration.
And as for Modesty; 'Tis true, although it bee a vertue alike re|quisite in all; yet, what those things are wherein 'tis exercised, Custome doth onely determine: You see here that familiar with our coyest, nicest Dames, which, in some places, would scarce be done by the most notorious strumpets; nay, what many times with us is but necessary, how strangely would it looke in the other sex? And I would faine know that man could give me a solid reason of this difference besides common custome. I am sure there can bee no habit whatsoever fancied to be so immodest, as wee should now account none at all to bee; yet there are some that with no slight rea|sons will maintaine our onely naturall dresse (were it but backed by a nerall Custome) would bee the most innocent; and those desires which by restraint are now chiefly inflamed, would then grow cold and dull, as wee see some things which else-where are accounted a recompence sufficient for a stab, here through there facility are scarce valued; Nor was it said amisse of one who called clothes a meere device hatch'd in Madam Venus Clo|set;  for surely they are the greatest stratagem by which her Em|pire doth subsist.


Old Cris.
I must confesse, Sir, you do represent some things unto mee, which before I did not so cleerely marke; But yet (Sir) were it granted, that custome were the onely rule for what were to bee done in these kind of matters, yet those things for which I did find fault with her, have nor obtain'd a generall use; for if wee should goe presently into the strees, wee should see not one in forty use them.


Know.
Herein, Sir, doth lie the grand mistake; for as many se|verall sorts of men, the various accidents of forune doth produce; so many severall fashions doth common use alo; nor is this more

then what hath beene provided for by publick lawes, in the best order'd Common-Wealths. Now Sir, If in my attire I do conforme myself to those of my degree, I never shall offend against the rule of decency; and for my part, I see nothing in her dresse, but what for some while hath generally been done by the civillest Ladies of her yeares and quality, especially in this place; for I must confesse, that may be star'd at in a Country towne, that here would bee but needfull. And this discourse, Sir, doth put me in mind of what I have known to have been the opinion of some Judicious men, that the dresse which of these late yeers hath been in request amongst us (what e're the aged out of their usuall vanity of magnifying their younger years wil say to the contrary) is the civillest, most comely, and less extravagant that hath been used for these many ages.


Old Cris.
Well daughter, Mr. Know-well hath so wel pleaded for you, that I am content that you shall follow your own humour, for this day at the least.  And if you doe go, you had best to goe presently, lest it be late before you come home, for I can tell, you the air is very sharp.


Know.
Your servant Sir. 


Old Cris.
God bu'ye, good Master Know.Exeunt severall waies.



SCENE III.
Enter Mrs. Pate in a Widows attire, and Iustice Quorum.

Iust.
Now Mrs. you have no more to doe, then to take out execu|tion, for you have a judgment of 5310 pounds.  Believe mee, your adversary was like to have served you but a crafty Citizens trick of it, if I had not bestirred my self for you.


Pate.
He that doth command you to plead the cause of the Widow, Sir, I hope, will reward you. 


Iust.
But what was the reason, I pray Mrs. that your husband did intrust him with so great a sum?


Pate.
Sir, going to the late Warrs, and fearing what hazard hee might thereby runne, did thinke he might have relied upon this mans fidelity, (he being his very intimate friend) little imagining that hee would have proved such a wicked knave, as to have cozen'd me his poor wife.  Shee Weeps.


Iust.
Peace, Mrs. for seeing the matter has succeded so well, you have little cause to weep.


Pate.
I Sir, 'Tis true: but whensoever I think of the good man, I cannot forbear, O! little did he think I should ever have been put to all this trouble and vexation.



Iust.
But the maine point now will be, whether this man be respon|sible?


Pate.
O Sir, that is not to be questioned, for he is on you cannot look upon, but you must think of thousands, a fat, greasie Burgo-master, he commonly goeth in a ruffe, and a black pinked Satan doublet, you had as good doubt of my Lord Major, and all the Aldermen; the publick Faith would not take up so much upon the Exchange, as his word.


Iust.
'Tis well, if it be so.  But Mrs. where be those writings you sent for me to look upon?


Pate.
You shall see them presently Sir. 
Sue, bring me the little black Trunk in my Chamber. .
Enter maid with a Trunke.
Here they be, Sir, some old writings of my husbands, I would bee glad to know what they meane. 


Su.
Forsooth, your brother is below with another Gent. they are newly come out of the Country.


Pate.
My brother!Shee runs out hastily.


Iust.
But Heak you hither, sweet heart; do you remember what you promised me.


Su.
I Sir, and if I durst, I could say somewhat.


Iust.
Durst? Why, what is the matter?


Su.
O Lord Sir, I am afraid she will be angry.


Iust.
Come, come, I'le warrant you: Here. Gives her money.


Su.
O Sir, You are a Noble Gentleman, and for your sake, I will venture her displeasure. The truth of it is, Sir, (but I hope you will not say I said so.)


Iust.
No, no, do not fear.


Su.
Well, Sir, I dare swear shee loves you.


Iust.
Say you so? Stay, here is somewhat more for you.

Gives her more money.

Sue.
I, Sir, for shee doth nothing but talke what a grave, comely, old Gent. you are, and very like her first husband.


Iust.
Why, was her first husband an old man?


Sue.
O, I Sir or else he never had had her, for I thinke there never was woman of so strange a humour as she is, in this world; for from her infancy, shee ever doted on old men; I have heard her say, that in these her late Law-troubles, it has been no small com|fort to her, that still she hath been conversant with grave Counsellers  Sergeants, and what a happiness she has had to look somtimes an hour together upon the Judges. Shee will goe and walke a whole afternoone in Charter-house-Garden, on purpose to view the ancient Gentlemen there.
And if shee hear but of a man that is buried with as many old men following him, as he is years old, she wil go a mile to see it: There is an old beggar that uses to come hither somtimes that she wil talk with an

hour together: sometimes she will condole her self that she did not live before the floud, that she might have had one of those ancient Patriarks; the last year she was scarce perswaded, but that she would take a Journey into some of the far Northern Nations, where men do ordinarily live unto seven or eight score years of age. As we were coming by S. Dunstans not long ago, she spied the Picture of old Par, she needs would have the Coach stay until she had bought it, and since she has hung it up in her Closet, and will weep sometimes over it an hour together.


Iust.
Nay, if this be true, I cannot tell what to think of it.


Sue.
Sir, not long ago there was a young Gentleman here about the Town, who hearing of her Riches, and knowing this her humor, had almost got her, by counterfeiting himself to be an old man.


Iust.
I?


Sue.
O I shall never, I think, forget how he came in a white Perriwig and his false beard; I cannot almost but laugh, when I think how handsomely he carried the businesse, how he made as if his hands trembled, and his head shaked, how he seemed to be deaf, and have the Gou, and twenty other Infirmities of age, insomuch that my Mi|stris was extremely taken with him.


Iust.
And how came he to misse her?


Sue.
The strangeliest that ever you heard: for all things were a|greed, the very Writings drawn, and when he came to seal them, be|cause he set his name without using a pair of Spectacles, she would ne|ver see him more.


Iust.
Nay, if she can love an old man so well.


Sue.
But here she comes, Sir. Exit Sue.

Enter Pate with Hadland and Slur.

Had.
Sister, I desire that you would entertain this Gentleman, Sir Thomas Cranfield, as my friend.


Slur.
Madam, I shall think it no small happinesse to be reckoned a|mongst the number of your servants.


Pat.
Sir, for my brothers sake, I shall be glad of your farther ac|quaintance.


Had.
Sister, I am loaden with a number of Services to you from your friends in the Country.


Pat.
How do they all, I pray? Sir Richard Howard, and my Lady Tanfield?
But, Brother, have you brought up the money I wrote for, you know what occasions of expence I have had in this Law business.


Had.
I could not in so short a time, Sister, procure so much as you wrote for; but I have made a shift to get almost 200 l. though a|mong your Tenants, the rest they will pay you when you come down, which your friends hope will not be long first; I promised them to bring you down with me.


Iust.
Ha! Tenants!Aside.



Had.
But, Sister, I must speak a word to you in private.


Slur.
Sir Iohn, I take my leave of you.


Had.
What are you going Sir Thomas? I will wait upon you anon at your Lodging.


Slur.
Madam, your most humble servant. Exit.

Exeunt Hadland and Pate.

Iust.
Stay, what is here? A Mortgage of the Manor of Dove 
A Bond for seven hundred pounds 
A Bond in nine hundred pound to Iohn Tompkins of S. Clements Es|quire. That was her husband sute.
Another Mortgage of Lands in Lincolneshire,to him too. There is no end of her Wealth.
And then the Land they talked of in the Country.  Enter Sue


Iust.
How now, Sue? what newes now?


Sue.
What do you think?


Iust.
What, prethee?


Su.
Did not you see a gallant Gentleman come with my Mistris her brother?


Iust.
I, Sir Thomas, I think they called him: What of him?


Su.
I dare say, he comes to be a Suiter to my Mistris. Some|what I have over-heard 
If you will but step in here a little, I believe you may heare more.

Exeunt.


SCENE IV.
Enter Hadland and Pate, Iustice and Sue at the
other door to over-hear them.

Had.
Sister, you see he is a proper Gentleman, and I can assure you he has almost seven thousand pounds per annum.


Pate.
Speak no more of him, brother, for I shall never think of him in that Nature.


Had.
Why? what is the reason, Sister?


Pat.
I desire that you would pardon me for that.


Had.
I hope you are engaged unto no body?


Pat.
No, not engaged.But She weeps.


Had.
What is the matter, Sister? Come, let me be partaker of what ever troubles you. You do not use to be thus strange to me.


Pat.
I do not indeed, but now, me thinks, I have too much cause for me to appear strange unto my self.


Had.
Why? what is the matter?


Pat.
From you (dear brother) I cannot conceal any thing, yet I

could wish you could now guesse my thoughts, and look into my mind, and see what strange passions there have ruled of late, without forcing of me to straine my modesty.


Had.
What? are you in love with any body? Come, let me know the party, a brothers advice may do you no hurt.


Pat.
If I should tell, I know you would laugh at me; but truly I shal rather deserve your pity.


Had.
Come, come, tell me; who is it?


Pat.
Did not you see an ancient Gentleman with me when you came in?


Had.
What, is it any son or kinsman of his?


Pat.
No, no. She weeps.


Had.
Who then?


Pat.
I have told you.


Had.
Who, that feeble and decrepit piece of age?


Pat.
Nay, brother.


Had.
That sad effect of some threescore years and ten, that antick relick of the last Century?


Pat.
Nay, brother, I told you, you would serve me so.


Had.
But, sister, prethee be a little serious. Dost thou love him indeed?


Pat.
Alas, dear brother, it is but too true.


Had.
It is impossible.


Pat.
One would think so indeed.


Had.
I grant, you may bear a reverence and regard, as you would to your fathers ashes, or your Grandfires Tomb.


Pat.
Witness all that are good and just, never a youth of two and twenty stirred more amorous desires then he hath done in me.


Iust.
I see now Sue, thou saist true.


Had.
Certainly the Villain hath bewitched her, could ever woman be thus mad else, to be in love with age and rottenness, to be in love with a withered carcass, whom its own soul being weary of, is rea|dy to forsake and leave?


Pat.
Alas, brother, you know I never did affect those vain, though pleasing braveries of youth, but still have let my mind on the more nobler part of man, which Age doth more refine and elevate; then it doth depresse and sink this same contemptible clod.


Had.
Well, Sister, to morrow you shall go down with me into the Country; I'll warrant we shall find them there shall make you forget this same reverend Sir.


Pat.
O never, never.


Had.
Do but try.
I have a Coach here in the Town, come, come, you shall go, I will peently go and ake order about things. Exount.

Ener Iustice and Sue.

Sue.
Now you will believe me another time.



Iust.
I can scarce believe my self; but is it possible that she should so love me, and I could never perceive it all this while?


Sue.
Alas, Sir, she is so modest, that I dare swear, except it had been to her brother, she would have concealed this same passion until it had broke her very heart.


Iust.
But what had I best to do?


Sue.
Nay, Sir, you see your danger, if her brother should carry her into the Country to morrow, how they may work upon her easie na|ture, I cannot tell.


Iust.
You say true.


Sue.
E'en strike while the iron is hot; for ought I know, if you let this night pass, you are gone for ever.


Iust.
Dost think she would marry me this night then?


Sue.
That would be somewhat sudden, I must confesse, but I dare swear you might perswade her unto any thing, if you do but take your opportunity when her Brother is gone.


Iust.
Well, I will try what may be done.
But, Sweet-heart, They were just now talking of Tenants that she had, has she any Land too in the Country?


Sue.
I, Sir, for my part, came to her since she came to London, and therefore cannot speak any thing of mine own knowledge, but some|what I believe I can guesse.


Iust.
Why, I pray?


Sue.
Sir, every now and then here comes a company of fellowes in letherne breeches with money to my Mistris, and here they keep a talk|ing of Leases, and renewing of Leases, and Fines; a deuce take them for me, I am sure I am fain to clean our Dining-Room some four or five times a week after them.


Iust.
Say you so? Say you so?


Sue.
Then (Sir) for a month together about last Lady-day, we lived upon nothing but Capons that these fellowes sent us.


Iust.
You were shrewdly hurt, were you not?


Sue.
'Twas but the last week that one, she calls him herBaily, I think.


Iust.
I, I, right, right; what of him?


Sue.
Why he sent her a Gammon of Bacon seasoned with pepper|cornes, that were due to her, one from each Farm.


Iust.
I?


Su.
And when that fellow comes up to the Town, there is such a talk|ing of Rents, Quit-rents, Reversions, Harriots, and I know not what all 
There are some other things she has, they use to talk much of, that I have quite forgot; Stay, Mannals I think they call them.


Iust.
Manors, you meane.


Sue.
I, Manors, Manors, what are they (Sir?) any sort of cattle?



Iust.
No, no, you Cockney.
How shall I wallow in Wealth! I shall never be able to ame my luxu|riant bags. I may found Hospitals, Colledges, or build Chur|ches.


Sue.
Sir, and have them turned to Stables.


Iust.
Mas, thou saist true, Wench. I may make Causeways or build Bridges.


Sue.
Well (Sir) you had not best to lose all, while you are a thinking of it.


Iust.
'Tis well said, I will go to her presently. Exeunt.




ACT III.

SCENE I.
Enter La-gul and Mrs. Bud.

La.
YOur Physiognomy (Madam) will erect a Monarchy greater then that of the Ottomans.


Bud.
Lord! What doth this mean?Aside.
I am confident (Sir) you do but complement.


La.
Complement! No, upon my Honour, Madam; for certainly your beauty was composed to captivate the world, and amongst the rest, to make me your eternal Bondslave.


Bud.
Truly Sir, I dare not think my self worthy of that honour.

Enter Orange-Woman with Oranges.

Wom.
Please your Honour, Madam, to have some Oranges: Please your Honour, dainty, curious, fine Oranges.


Bud.
Let's see Woman.How many Oranges for two pence?


Wom.
How many for two pence! Take you, you use to come to Hide Park, I'll warrant. I wonder under what Milk-pail you have been bred.


La.
Was there ever such an affront?
What must I do now? May I draw upon a Woman by the rule of Honour? Or must I kick her?Aside.
You dirty whore, you.


Wom.
You think your self a pretty fellow in your buttoned cap. Exit Woman.

Enter Woman with Apricocks.

La.
I could wish (Madam) that she had been one that I could have in an honourable way, sacrificed my dearest blood to your incom|parable Beauty.


Wom.
Please your Honour, Madam, curious Apricocks Please your Honour to buy my Apricocks?



La.
I think, I will not be so affronted again.
Come woman, let's see your Apricocks. What is the price of these two baskets?


Wom.
They are three shillings a piece, if it please your Honour.


La.
Three shillings a piece! What no more? Have you no better?


Wom.
If it please your Honour, at the other end there are some that are Crowns a piece.


La.
Are there so? And, I pray, why did not you shew them at the first?


Wom.
Because I did not think you such an Asse. Aside.


La.
Please you to chuse, Madam.


Bud.
I'l have this.


La.
Come, I'l have one too.
Hold up your basket: There is an Angel, I think. Flings her a handful of money.


Wom.
God blesse your Honours.
And send you more wit. I rose on my right side, I think, to day. Aside.


Bud.
What do you mean to spend your money thus, Sir?


La.
O God, Madam, were I mater of the Indies, of all the hidden Treasures of the sea, your Beauty should command it all.


Bud.
Truly, Sir, you make me that I cannot tell what to say.
But (Sir) had we not best go where the company is again?


La.
I will go see (Madam) whether the Coach be where we left it. Exit.

Enter La-gul again.

La.
Madam, will it please you to walk, for the Coach is yon|der?Exeunt.



SCENE II.
Enter Know-wel and Mrs. Crisis talking.

Know.
For you, Lady, are the only she of whom I ever yet could seriously in this nature think of; And if I shal e're find in you an affection answerable to my desires, they then will rest, as having attain|ed the chiefest good I e're could hope for from your Sex.


Cris.
Am I the only she (say you) that you ever could think of? That very thing me thinks) doth make me suspect whatsoever else you have said.


Know.
'Tis true (Lady) I needs must say, that I have seen ma|y a one in whose enjoyment, perhaps, I could have had no meane

content; we might have lived together with all the usual love, she might have made me a Father, and I have thought so; and if I should have lost her, I should have thought my self bereaved of one of those things that serve to pass away a troublesome life, as good company, or Sack.
But one, in admiring of whom I could be content to spend my time, one whom, rather then to misse, I should run all imaginable hazards, I never yet saw, till you.


Cris.
Come, fye, fye, Mr. Know-wel. Truly, I did not expect this from you.
Should one of those youths indeed, who then think they shew most of Accomplishment, when they expresse most Service unto us; not surely that they have that real value they pretend; but because (as sometimes great Doctors, upon trifling silly questions, wil shew their Learning) they judg us to be convenient properties to try their Wit and Courtship on: Should such a one (I say) have said so much, I should have esteemed it accordingly.
But what your most sober judgment can find out in me, a thing so trifling and inconsiderable to occasion these kind of words, I do not a little wonder.


Know.
Lady, do not wrong your self with these meane thoughts, for certainly there is not that person in the world that I do value like you. I will not so far trespasse on your modesty to tell you why; yet I have not been esteemed to act things irrational.


Cris.
Value me, Sir! for what?
Me thinks, were I but subject to those general imputations, to which our Sex is liable, it were enough to extinguish such a thought.
You see, Sir, I am a woman, one of the most undervalued Creatures living; we never yet by any polity were allowed to meddle with any thing but a needle: We are not esteemed to know ought of rational but our wills; nay, some will not allow us for to know our wills. And should I but consider my self by what some Satyrick Wits say of us I could not but believe my self one of the most despicable things in Na|ture.


Know.
You have indeed no little cause for to quarrel with the ge|neral custome that doth put such a difference betwixt you and us. For have we not all the same rational souls, the same affects and qua|lities? Nay, I need must say, I have not seen more acute differen|cing and discerning spirits, then I have in some women; nor do I see any reason, but if they should improve and blow those natural sparks they are endued with, by the same means that we do use (neglecting those poor mechanick things to which the absurd humour of the world doth usually addict them) but that they would make a greater blaze then the most eminent of men. And such accomplishments meeting with the usual beauty and sweetnesse of their Sex, must needs extremely cap|tivate and ravish, nor would any thing come so nigh Divinity.



Cris.
Well Sir, Although it were granted that there might be some|what possible in woman sitting to be valued, what were that to me? I should no more dare to believe my self owner of any such thing, then that I did possesse the Indies.


Know.
No!
Could I but upon as good an account believe you ever to be mine, I should believe my self to possesse more then them.
Come (dear Lady) will you give me but the least of hopes to enjoy what e're perfection it be that you are owner of? Shall I think ever to call it mine?


Cris.
Truly (Sir) I think not, for.


Know.
Hold Lady, let me have a little more warning before you in|tend to give me a stroak so mortal; do not in one instant make me a thing irrational, of no design. For since my hopes have once made you their end, there can nothing surely ever appear to me, so worthy as to fix a thought upon.


Cris.
Sir, you did a little mistake me, for (as I think) I never did yet any thing that might encourage you to speak in this nature. So truly, thereby I needs must say, I did not intend to destroy what|soever hopes you have conceived of me; for that which I was a going to say, (had you but given me leave) was only this:
Suppose me Mistris of all the Wit and Parts that ever yet was incident to our Sex,
And (now I am supposing of such impossible things) suppose me (as you just now said) yours; what were that to you more then to all the world? for you could as well hope to appropriate the Air as such Ac|complishments. The Sun it self doth not afford more general and communicative influence then they would do.
Nay, perhaps as we now are, you might more enjoy such qualities; for what would wit in a wife serve for, but to interfere with yours. Nor have they been esteemed unwise, whom I have heard say, they could well spare all Judgment in one of that relation, save what were requisite to a handsome dresse, or so.


Know.
I am so far, Lady, from thinking so, that were that realwhich you now supposed, the greatest Epicure could not more enjoy what e're his sensual appetite doth prompt him to, then I should those perfecti|ons of your mind; for then we should not only be linked in that my|stical knot, nor with those more natural tyes and charmes, as you are woman or fair; but certainly we should close in that stricter conjun|cture of friend and friend, the greatest cement possible 'twixt humane souls.
And where it joines us with the more refin'd minds, it is a happinesse that the super-errogating Saint in his boldest error could never hope to merit. For to have one who as my better Genius, might regulate even in their first matter my imparted thoughts. What can be a greater bliss?
Or if I had any thing of worth or value in me, to have such a con|scient judge and witnesse, would almost imitate the pleasure that some in the thought of an all-knowing Deity, can in any mis-construed action solace themselves against the opinion of the world.
'Tis true, I know some kind of Madam, who perhaps, having some not unhappy vaine which a little too much taking with the world, might drive her into strange conceits of what shee scarce can tell, and make her prove as troublesome and crosse, as sometimes are the winds, and have as various and fantastick waies: but wee should no more thwart or differ from each other, then truth would doe from truth, the waies of judgment and discretion being as certaine and demonstrative: wee should anticipate each others thoughts, our a|ctions would be as harmonious as are those of Ants or Bees, as if by some secret law of nature we were designed to carry on some com|mon worke: what say you, Lady, should we not? shall I ever enjoy in you this happinesse?


Cris.
If not Sir. Your Fancy that hath thus largely supplyed all my defects, will easily make good to you a greater losse.


Know.
Nay, Prethee be as serious as is the love I bear thee; and tell me freely and plainly what result that which you have observ'd of me hath wrought upon your thoughts; for this is the onely thing by which I must either stand or fall: for should I by intreaties seeke to force your will, 'twould be but vaine, since if you cannot afford, to answer my affection, they must needs make you loath, if not contemn and scorn me.


Cris.
Shall I answer you then, and will you not be sorry?


Know.
Hold, for me thinks I stand with the same paine, that the pri|sones doth, that is to receive sentence either of life or death; faine would I be out of doubt, but loth I am to undergoe the trial; but speak, for certainly you have no condemning look.


Cris.
Well then Sir; to be short, if I should say you are a man, like whom, I never yet saw any; such a one, whom when in my prayers I have thought of man, I have wish'd for, and desired; it is a truth Sir, which perhaps, by the exact rule of wooing you should not yet have known; and now you know it, you may be sorry that you so easily know it; but I cannot help it.


Know.
What could I more desire!


Cris.
Sir, but I believe it is pretty late, wherefore, if you please, let us go to the Coach again. Exeunt.




SCENE III.
Enter Love-wit.

L.
It was my better genius surely, put me on this device, it could not else have fallen out so luckily; for me thinks I have observed a more thn ordinary kindnesse between my Cozen and this Gentleman, since their coming home; and now I call to mind, this was the man whom shee did so commend today, and defend against us all; I needs must say, that I was much mistaken in him, for surely, he is one of far more worth then I did take him for to be.
Well, if she have any such desires, would heaven enflame them to the height, and so finish my imperfect hopes, which already doe begin to take some shape and forme. 
But here I think she is.  Enter Crisis, and Know-well.


Lov.
What, are you come, Affection?


Cris.
I, is it not time?


Lov.
And how go now affaires at Hide-Park? what new beauties are there come to Town, since I have been in the Country? which is the chiefest planet that doth now shine in that round-moving orbe of Coaches?


Cris.
You should have asked, what was the newest fashion, who had the finest gowne, or the handsomest dresse; for these are things wee women onely mark: This Gent. I believe, would better have resolved you that question.
What say you Mr. Know well, which was the handsomest Lady that you saw there?


Know.
That, Lady, would be a very difficult business to determine, I should rather chuse me a Mrs. by her picture, or as the Italians, they say, do, through a window, and thinke my self subject unto lesse deceit.


Lov.
Why, I pray Sir?


Know.
When one sees, Lady, nothing but a face, and that dress'd up unto the height, I might as well Judge of a book by the fine Greeke title; the Vardingales had not so much imposture; give me a place where I may see and Judge of all dimensions.
I remember I mark'd a Lady there whom I have seene somewhere before, she is one (Ladies) that hath the strangest antick shape as ever nature in her greatest whimsey was Author of.
But as sometimes you shall see a pretty neat device carved on a knotty crab-tree stick, her face, I must confesse, is not much amisse, for as she order'd the business with her advantageous sitting in the Coach, she was the only shining planet, as you say, that drew all eyes upon her.



Lov.
No Sir, she was but a false deluding Comet.


Know.
I, so shee might, for I am sure she has a huge excrescence at her back.


Cris.
Well, but Mr. Know-well, what say you to the Western Lady that I shewed you?


Know.
She doth wel, I must confesse, at a distance, but when wee came neerer, me thought she was but ordinary.


Cris.
There was one I told you of, that I said was newly come to the town, is not she handsome?


Know.
Handsome?


Cris.
I will assure you there are some whose opinions are accounted very authentick in these kind of things, that say so.


Know.
Surely then I believe they have a mind to try how much their judgments can impose upon the world.


Cris.
There was a lass in the Coach with the green Livery that you look'd much upon.


Know.
She had indeed a good complexion, and I believe right; besides, a pretty innocent look, as if she meant no hurt, and pitty it were to do her any. And although shee have some features which, ac|cording to the exact rule are not esteemed handsome, yet cer|tainly, there is somewhat in her face, will force one to believe them pleasing.


Cris.
Do you remember Sir, she in the cloth of Silver wast-coate, that I bad you take notice of.


Know.
Yes, that I do, and truly shee will serve well enough, only me thinks she has a kind of sullen look, as if she would be angry, if the artillery of her eyes should fail.


Lov.
There was, when I was last in the town, a City Lady, that was much talked of.


Cris.
O! I wonder how I have forgot her all this while, that was shee we overtook, you ey'd her much.


Know.
I did indeed, because I have heard so much of her; shee has a most compleat and perfect beauty, nor can the greatest critick in this kind find any fault with the least proportion of her face, but yet me thought I was no more taken with it, then I should with some curi|ous well drawn picture.


Lov.
That Sir, is somewhat strange. 


Know.
In my mind, not at all, Lady; for it is not alwaies that we are Governed by what the generall fancy of the world calls beauty; for each soul hath some predominant thoughts, which when they light on ought that strike on them, there is nothing doth me enflame.
And as in musick, that pleaseth not most which with the greatest art and skill is composed; but those aires that do resemb and stir up some dormant passion to which the mind is addicted. So I believe, never yet was any one much taken with a face, in which he did not espie ought that did rouse and put in motion some affection that hath ruled in

his thoughts, besides those features, which only for the sake of common opinion we are forced to say doth please.


Lov.
Yonder comes Mr. La-gull, I think.


Know.
I will stand aside here a little, then. Exit Know-well.

Enter La-gull and Girle.

Lov.
Mr. La-gull, your servant.
What? are you come but now?


La.
No, Madam, We staid somewhat the longer by reason of a small accident that hapned.


Lov.
What was that, I pray?


Cris.
I hope it is not another story of a busk. Aside.


La.
This night, Madam, there was a horse-race, on which I had laid a trifling bett of some forty pounds. Wherefore I being desirous for to see it, (first, craving pardon of this Lady, for my so rudely lea|ving her) got upon my Barbary Mare that my Lacquey had there. And (Madam) there happened to be there a French man, one who (as I have heard) is a Monsieur of much honour and repute in his Country: He (Madam) observing me, said I did ride well, and ma|nage my horse handsomely for an English man; which I over hearing, told him, that I was transcendently engaged to him for his good opi|nion of me; but yet I could not in honour but take notice of the affront he put upon my Country in those words; wherefore (Madam) I told him, that if he pleased, he should find an English man could rule a sword as well as a Horse; and upon that (Madam) we drew.


Cris.
There was no hurt done I hope? was there?


La.
Not much, Madam.
Yet I must confesse, I made a thrust at him, which he bearing down run quite through his Porte-canon; And he with a hanger that he had, stroke at my head, which I could not so fully ward, but that he cut off the button of my Cap; and then (Madam) we were parted by the company but he bid me look to hear further from him, and went his way, and I came back to this same Lady.


Cris.
Truly Sir, your Country cannot but look upon you as one of her chiefest Champions.


La.
O God Madam! the honour of my Country is far dearer to mee, then my life. I should be unworthy to live in it, should I have suffer'd it to receive such an affront. Enter servant with a letter.


Ser.
Sir, here is one hath brought you a letter.


La.
For mee? I'le warrant 'tis the Gent. I talked of, hath sent me a challenge. For I have taken order to have one sent, the more to countenance this same storie.  Aside.


Lov.
A challenge say you, is it? pray let me see, I never yet did see the fashion of a challenge.

Shee takes it.

La.
Nay Madam. 


Lov.
Come, I will read it.



La.
If you wil, I cannot tell how to helpe it, for I was not born to contradict faire Ladies wills.


Lo.
Stay, What is this?
Sir, I (according as you desired me) have found out the Gentleman you wot of, whom I do really find to have much interest in your ad|versary.


La.
Hold Lady, for this is not a challenge, but a letter of some pri|vate businesse. 


Lov.
'Tis no matter, now I have begun, I will make an end of it.


La.
Excuse me, Madam.


Cris.
Why Mr. La-gull, I thought you had not been born to con|tradict fair Ladies wills. 


La.
Nay, Madam, I must have it. He offers to take it from her.


Lov.
Here  Shee flings it t Crisis. La-gull offers to take it from her with some rudenesse, shee striving to keep it, in the midst of the bustle Enter Know-wel.


Kn.
Why, you uncivill fellow, what is the matter?He makes him let her goe.


La.
What, is he here too? how unluckily it falls out? Mis-for|tune on Mis fortune!


Cris.
Here Mr. Know-well, read this.


Know.
Read this! He reads the beginning.

But I could by no means prevaile with him to be a means of taking your quarrel up, except you lend him the summe I told you of, which (you to day referring the matter unto mee) I hav promi|sed him; and have procured one that will lay downe the money. Wee shall be all at night at the old place, where I desire you would not faile, but meete, that wee may make an end of the busi|nesse.
Your humble servant
Rich. Hadland.



Lov.
No surely, this is no challenge.


La.
What shall I do? I am disgraced for ever. My honour, my honour and reputation is lost eternally.


Cris.
Not a whit Sir; for to tell you plainly, there is none here, that I believe, did ever think you had any to lose.


La.
I am abused, some body has abused me with this letter.


Know.
You are abused indeed Sir, and will be more, if you do not take heed.


La.
Come Mr. La-gull, you are amongst none but your friends, if you will be ruled by us, I'le warrant you you shall doe well enough yet.



Cris.
You had as good take some counsel now, lest you repent when it is too late.


Kow.
The truth of it is, Sir, you are hapned into the hands of some sule youths, who knowing you to bee a man of a faire fortune, ne|ver any Merchants Cash-keeper, or Lasse of twenty thousand pounds, had more designes on them, then they have on you


La.
What would you have me do?


Cris.
Doe? Why, e'ne as those of your temper use to do; leave this town, marry, and seat your selfe in the country.


Lo.
Come not up hither, except it be in an Easter Terme, or so, to buy your wife a new gown.


Cris.
Trouble your selfe no more about these nice and subtle rules of honour, or in getting a fine affected straine of complement; but if you will needs bue your brain, you may learn the strange dialect of Hawks and Hounds.


Lov.
Some fine speeches though, you may keep in Lavender, to ex|cuse your Christmas cheer, or to use in distributing a Feasant of your own taking.


Cris.
You need not then be so inquisitive after the modes and fashi|ons; a fine gaudy suit or two to wear on Market dayes, or in the assize-week, will be well enough.


Know.
In stead of roaring night and day in Taverns, or venturing with a company of Cheats, at some Ordinary, the price of a Farme, keepe your drinking matches of tubs of Ale, and your bowling dayes, where your Crown rubbers will not do you much prejudice.


Lov.
And when you have a mind to play the good husband, a nursery, or a hop-ground may sind you good imployment.


Cris.
You may learne to inoculate, and if any Ladies come to visit you, a dish of fruit, with a story how you your self did graft it, may serve for all your costly treatments here.


Know.
Upon a rainy day, or when you have nought else to do, you may read Sir Walter Raleigh, Lord Bacons Natural History, the Holy Warre, and Browns Vulgar Errors. You may find too some stories in the English Eusebius, and the Book of Martyrs, to hold dis|course with the Parson on a Sunday dinner.


Lov.
Sometimes to your wife you may read a piece of Shak-speare, Suckling, and Ben. Iohnson too, if you can understand him.


Know.
You may read the Scout, and Weekly Intelligence, and talk politickly after it. And if you get some smattering in the Mathema|ticks, it would not be amisse, the Art of dyalling, or to set your clock by the quadrant, and Geography enough to measure your own land.


Lov.
Thus you may employ your self, and do the businesse that you came for into the world, uphold your name and family, make your son somewhat at the better Gentleman, in making his pedigree the lon|ger by one.



La.
I am highly ingaged to you for this advice, and hence forward I shall study to observe it. Enter Constable, and others with him.


Con.
Is not Mr. Know-well here?


Knw.
My name is Know-well, friend, what would you have with me?


Con.
O, is it so? Then pray come along with me.


Know.
With you? for what?


Con.
Come away, I say, without dispute, for I am a man of Au|thority.


Know.
Cry mercy, for I might very well have mistaken you. But I pray, what is the matter?


Con.
The matter? as if you did not know. 


Know.
Not I, nor can I guesse.


Con.
You do not know I'le warrant, one Mr.  Wel bred, I think they call him.


Lov.
Why, I pray, Mr. Constable, what of him?


Know.
I have some little acquaintance with him.


Lov.
But what of him?


(Cris.
Why, what doth it concern you, I wonder, that you are so hasty to know?)


Con.
Nothing, but that this Gentleman hath kill'd him a little, he is only dead.


Lov.
Dead!


Con.
I, as a door naile, I'le warrant you by this time; I am sure I left him gasping almost two hours ago.


Lov.
Dead!


Con.
I, as a Herring, I dare lay my life, by this time.


Cris.
How doe you Cozen? are you not wel?


Lov.
A kind of a fainting fit that uses to take me sometimes, since I had my Ague in the Country, it will presently over again.


Know.
What can be the meaning of this? I have not seene him to day.


Con.
Come, come, I am not to dispute that with you.  You did not send him a challenge neither? did you?


Know.
I, a challenge! certainly you are mistaken.


Con.
Yes I'le warrant, did not these eyes see it taken out of his pocket? but if I am mistaken, then pray come along with me without more adoe.


Lov.
What strange unlucky accident hath hapned, that hath thus blasted all my hopes that did begin to bud, and made that occasion of my endlesse grief, which I had thought had been the way to what I had most desired. Aside.


Cris.
This is a sad story; wee had best to follow and inquire further into it.  Stay, Now I think of it, I will go to his ldging; Prethy Mr. La-gull, goe bid your man get a Coach. Exeunt.




SCENE II.
Enter Caster.

Cast.
Malitious wit could never have devised such a plague.  Fight I dare not.  'Slid, but here he comes I think, what shall I do? I will walk on, perhaps he may not see me. Enter La-gul.


La.
My man is out of the way, who shall I get to get a Coach?  But yonder is Caster, certainly he cannot but see me, yet he takes no notice of me; perhaps it is the mode not to take notice after a chal|lenge: I will do so too. Exit.


Cast.
Nay Mr. La-gull, good Mr. La-gull, I did but. 
'Slid, I thought hee had been here. 
What a strange kind of thing is this same fear, that doth not only im|prove reall dangers, but raises fantastick ones, where there are none at all. Enter La-gull.


La.
Surely he call'd me.


Cast.
Thou prodigious and unruly monster, could I but quell thee!


La.
He talkes terribly, certainly he doth intend to fight pre|sently.


Cast.
Look, here he is again, if my fear doe not againe deceive me. I had e'ne best to tell him the truth, yeeld up my sword, and put my self to his mercy, I care not upon what termes.


La.
'Tis so  he drawes.  Hold. But they say he has no mercy,  I had then as good die according to the rule of ho|nour. He drawes also, and begins to fight.


Cast.
Hold, hold, I yeeld. Murther. Murther. 


La.
Give me your sword then;


Cast.
Here, here. 


La.
Is it no more to fight then so? is this the thing all this while I have been so affrighted with? have I so easily master'd such a man? a man so valiant as they said he was? whom then need I fear?
Me thinks I could now fight with any body, would any living thing but affront me. Exeunt several wayes.




SCENE V.
Enter Hadland.

Had.
What have I done? For they say he is like to dye. He was too (as I have since heard) a very accomplished man; Nay, certain|ly I was much deceived in him, for his carriage had much of spirit in it, and a Gentleman.
Well, little did I think I should ever have been compelled unto these kind of courses; and nothing doth more vex me, then that I am fain to consort my self with such unworthy things, which I should abhor, did not my fortunes, broken by these late Wars, force me to make them the instruments of my subsistance, One of them though I would be now glad to light on, if I could tell where. But yonder I think he comes. Enter Caster.
Why, how now Caster? Where hast thou been? For I have been looking for thee almost all over the Town, I think.


Cast.
All over the Town! You might have chanc'd to have look'd beyond China and Iapan, and not have found me.
Well, I thank God I am here now, but I was like to have been further then ever Drake was, by this time.


Had.
Why, Prethee, where?


Cast.
Where? Why, in that Terra incognita, the other world.


Had.
The other world! What wouldst thou have done there? they do not there play at dice: or if they do, old Nick, I doubt, would go nigh to be the better Cheat.
But what was the matter?


Cast.
Why, I met with the dreadful blade.


Had.
Whom do you mean?


Cast.
Whom should I mean? the terrible Squire La-gul.


Had.
He has not spoiled all now, I hope. Aside.
Well, and what then?


Cast.
What then! He drew, and came upon me like any lightning, but my discreet and timely submission, together with the coming of some company, did a little asswage his fury.


Had.
Did you submit unto him, say you?


Cast.
What should I do else?


Had.
If I did not think so 
I could now kick thee, could I but afford to take the pains.
Thou hast spoiled all that we have been plotting of this fortnight, when we had just brought it to perfction.



Cast.
You would have had me (I'll warrant) have been such an Ass, as to have fought and ventured my life.


 Had.
Fought! Thou needst not so much as have made a mouth, rowned, or put thy self into a fighting posture.


Cast.
What should I have done then unto such a son of Thun|der?


Had.
A son of Thunder! a more arrant Coward then thy selfe, if possible.


Cast.
Did not you tell me he was another kind of man?


Had.
I did indeed in jest to fright you a little, but we this night were to have had Two hundred pounds of him to have made you his friend.


Cast.
Well, this it is, when you will put me on things that are out of my Element; I could have been a Cheat this seven years, and have done well enough.


Had.
Well, I have a businesse for you to do, which if you will do handsomely, you will redeem my opinion.


Cast.
Is it to fight?


Had.
No.


Cast.
Then I'll warrant you. Exeunt.

The end of the fourth Act.



ACT V.

SCENE I.
Enter Welbred, and Crisis, Welbred his arm in a Scarf.

Welb.
BUt surely you were not alwayes of this mind.


Cris.
I needs must say, I was not; for it is not long since I did look on you, as one with whom rather by the Decree of Heaven, then my own desires, I was ordained to live as wife. Al|though (I must confesse) I never saw any thing so unpleasing in you, but that (if such a thing had been) I could have afforded you whate|ver love and duty you could have expected from one of that relation; yet this is more then I am sure you could promise to your self from any thing I ever shewed to you; But the various accidents of this day hath so fully represented to me a man with whom my soul would more a|gree, that in him I am resolved to rest as to these kind of thoughts.



Wel.
Nay, Lady, if you be in earnest, e'en as you please; for I would this wound would but admit as easie cure as any you have given me. And I cannot tell what out of the height of Courtship I may have said, but I believe you do not think I was born to dy of love.
Yet I know not, for the story that you have told me of your Cozen, hath raised some kind of thoughts in me that I never had before. And if this that she hath done be out of love to me (as it cannot but deserve, so) it must needs cause in me an answerable affecti|on.


Cris.
Well, Sir, the Gentleman is by this time before the Justice; it is more then time that I went and enformed them of the truth.
But I had almost forgot: Here is a ring Sir, you gave me to day, which I desire you would take back.


Wel.
Excuse me, Lady, It is not of that value.


Cris.
Believe me, Sir, I will not keep it.


Wel.
Well, then I will tel you what you shall do; e'en present it to your Cozen in my name as an earnest of my love. I hope it will not be long, before I may be in that condition, as to wait upon her my self, for I do feel my self much amended now my wound is stop|ped, my illnesse only proceeding from some loss of blood.


Cris.
Well, Sir, I wish you a speedy recovery.


Wel.
Nay, Lady, I may wait upon you to the door. Exeunt.



SCENE II.
Enter Hadland, Slur, and Caster.

Had.
Come, here they are, what will you do?


Slur.
Let's see.
Faith, all our old devices, false cubed Dice with Quicksilver, the box|es with springs, besides all the other Arts of the hand, are grown as common as the Juglers box.


Cast.
They are only fitting to cozen Prentices of their Christmasse Box-money.


Had.
What say you to that which I told you of the other day?


Slur.
The business with the Loadstone?


Cast.
That I believe is not very common, nor is it easie to be disco|vered; but you know we are not now provided for that.



Had.
Then you must e'en see what you can do with your old Tricks.


Slur.
These Lads I am afraid will go nigh for to discover them.


Had.
No I'll warrant you, they are drunk up unto a handsome pin. Besides, let the worst come to the worst, I wil be here hard by. Exeunt Slur and Caster.

Enter La gul.

Had.
Mr. La gul! Your servant; I am glad to hear of your good successe. They say, you have gained a great deal of Honour to day.


La.
Take your Honour for me; I am not now for Honour, but for fighting.
And first I will begin with you, as the principal man that has abused me.


Had.
This is brave, I vow,
What is the matter with him?
Is your name La-gul?


La.
Yes, I am the self same man, only I do a little better under|stand my self, what an Asse you have made me all this while. And to be short, I here demand of you satisfaction, you being the only man that either dares, or is worthy to give it.
Come draw, for I am resolved.


Had.
As I live, I like your resolution howsoever.

Enter two Gentlemen beating Slur and Caster.

Slur.
Hadland, Hadland, help, help.


Had.
Why how now, Sirs, what is the matter?


1.
They are Cheats, arrant Cheats.


2.
Cheats, Cheats, they have cozen'd us of almost 100 l. but at the last we caught them.


1.
Rogues, Cheats, give me my money, or I will beat out your braines.


La.
Come let them alone since they have made a couple of fools of you, do not you make your selvs more by keeping such a doings. 'Slid they have cozened me of at the least 300 l. within this fortnight, and yet you hear me say never a word.


1.
Fools of us, do you say!


La.
I, most notorious fools and coxcombs; nothing more plain, for thus I will prove it: You came in with money in your purses, but this money you have lost, and are like to go away without it, therefore you are fools.


Hd.
I deny your Minor, for I say, they have not lost it, but have plaid with Cheats, and have been cozen'd of it, therefore they are not fools.


La.
'Tis true, they have plaid with Cheats, and have been cozened, but therefore they are fools.



1.
Shall we endure this?


Had.
But they did not know them to be Cheats, and therefore they are not fools.


La.
'Tis true, they did not know them to be Cheats; but therefore they are fools.
What say you? are you not Gentlemen?


2.
Shall we lose our money and be abused too? you uncivil, rude fellow. They draw upon La-gul.


La.
Nay, if you be thereabouts, here is an Argument to prove you fools that you have not seen. And this shall make you con|fesse. Drawes.


Had.
Nay Gentlemen, two to one is too much, there shall be no unequal doings. He drawes, they fight, and disarme the two Gentlemen, in the mean while Slur and Caster run away.


La.
This act hath reconciled me to thee; 'twas bravely done, I vow, and like thy selfe; for whatsoever courses you have run of late, I have not long since heard much of your worth and value.


Had.
The truth of it is, I have done some things, more for to satisfie my wants, then through my own desires. And I am now grown so weary of this kind of life, that I could wish any other em|ployment, though never so mean, that would but maintain me but as a Gentleman.


La.
I'll tell you what, I think I shall now shortly marry, and set|tle my self in the Country; if you will come and live with me, and bear me company, I will continue what I give you, and more will adde (if you do desire) and whatsoever is past, I will forget, and never think of, except it be over a bottle of Sack when we have a mind to be merry.


Had.
Your offer is noble, and if a designe that I have in hand, do chance to fail, may possibly be opportune. However, as it cannot but much engage me, so I shall endeavour to shew how sensible I am of this your Civility. Nor


La.
Hold, for I am now grown quite out of conceit with Com|plements; if you will come, I will assure you, you shall be wel|come.
And as for you, my brace of Asses, now I hope you are not so furious but that one may in sober sadnesse prove you a couple of fooles for venturing of your money upon uncertain chance.


Had.
I hope not so.


La.
Yes, but I will, and because they shall not take it ill, I will assure you it is no more then what a sober Gentleman proved me for the selfe-same cause not above halfe an hour since.



Had.
That (Sir) in my mind, if you be in earnest, is somewhat strange; for although that the chance of dice is certain in it self, and doth (as all other things of chance) depend on sure and natural cau|ses; yet these causes either being unknown to us, or else not in our power, their effects must needs to us, before they come to pass, be also unknown; and from this ignorance, if thereby we are concerned, must needs arise a certain strife and Altercation of hopes and fears, which with no little pleasure doth affect the soul.
Now Sir, all pleasures by providence being created for our better be|ing, may rationally enough be (if but discreetly) used.
From hence it followes, that one may not only play at Dce, but also venture so much upon their chance, whereby these passions may arise.


La.
'Tis true, Sir, if one venture no more; but to venture so much, as that the losse thereof may mke any considerable alteration in ones fortune, cannot but be (as he said) the height of folly.


Had.
Why so, Sir For have I not as probable and rational hopes for to improve, as to impaire the same, Chance in reason being supposed impartial unto none?


La.
But, Sir, then said he, ones estate and fortune, being the principal thing that makes one to be valued in the world, I cannot certainly more rationally imply the force and vigour of my wit, then about that.
Now (Sir) in a thing that so much concernes me, wholly to balk whatsoever benefit my judgmen might afford, and put my self into such a way, where the starkest ool has as much advantage as I, and more too, if the Proverb be tu must needs, in any sober mans opinion render me a fool.


Had.
Well, Gentlemen, I can no longer help you, but that I see there is a necessity you will be concluded fools.


La.
Well then my couple of fools, adieu, and here also I do take my leave of whatsoever folly I have been guilty of.
Stay, there was a pair of Knaves too, that I should have bid God bu'y; but 'tis no matter, I shall see them again when I next come to Town;
For as long as London City doth endure,
In it a knave, as well as fool, to find you shall be sure.


Had.
That (Sir) is no marvel; for fools and knaves are the two main springs on which not only that, but all the world doth move; he that would have none of these, encounters providence, and would overturne the policy of the world: were all things of one temper, the Universe would not subsist one minute: were all men wise, the world would be at a stand, whilst each do prove unmalleable unto others designes.
Fooles and Knaves are the two Poles on which the wheels of For|tune turne: 'Tis these make Riches, Honour, with a health|ful

course to ebb and flow through all the world, which else would rot and putrifie in some particular names and families.


La.
But I shall be staid for, for I have appointed to meet at a cer|tain place.


Had.
Your servant Exeunt severall waies.



SCENE III.
Enter Iustice and Pate

Iust.
Come my Chuck, now thou art mine, and whatsoever is in this house is thine.


Pat.
But when my brother knowes this, he will never endure me for serving him so.


Iust.
'Tis no matter, so long as thou hast my love.


Pat.
I Sir, if I were assured of that, I would despise all the world be|sides; but I doubt I have too much cause to fear, that it is my Wealth you have married, and not me.


Iust.
But you shall have no such cause, I'l warrant you.
O my dear Honey, I could wish that thou wert worth never a groat, that thou mightst see how I love thee.

Enter Goosquil.

Goos.
Sir, there is the Constable without, he hath brought a Gen|tleman.


Iust.
What? Cannot he let me be quiet on my Wedding-day. Exit Pate

Enter Constable, c. Know-well.

Iust.
Come Mr. Constable, what is the matter?


Con.
Why, Sir, an't please your Worship, I have reprehended a man upon suspicion of murder.


Iust.
Of murther! God forbid man, I hope not so.


Con.
Look you (Sir) I do but charge him of suspicion of murther, I do not lay flat murther to his hands: I'll warrant you I know what I do.


Iust.
Well, but how stands the case? What witnesse have you of it?


1.
If it please your Honourable Worship, that which I have to say a|gainst this Gentleman under correction, in brevity is only this.


2.
Nay, an't like your Worship, I saw the first beginning, therefore, I hope you will give me leave to speak first.



Iust.
Come on then friend, you look like an honest fellow; what are you?


2.
An't like your Worship, I am by Trade a Black-Smith. I was a Prentice in Fetter-lane, and have beene a man for my self ever since the last great Sicknesse, which is some thirty years agoe, I think, for I am sure our Ned was born the year after, and hee is nine and twenty now this next long Vaca|tion.


Iust.
Well, but what can you say to the businesse?


2.
Why, an't like your Worship, I this Afternoon, after I had bid my wife lay down the shoulder of Mutton that (an't like your Worship) I bought in the morning, I went out into the fields (an't like your Worship) to take a turne or two to get me a stomack.
But I had almost forgot one main thing, for as I was going, I met with an old companion of mine, one Will. Freeman by name. An't like your Worship, I tell you no lye, for as they say, Tell the truth and shame the Divel.


Iust.
Well, but what then, friend?


2.
Why, An't like your Worship, honest Will said I, it was a merry old world when you and I were Prentices together in Fetter|lane. And upon that, (an't like your Worship) he would needs have me go spend my two pence with him.


Iust.
Well, but come to the point, what do you know concerning this Gentleman?


2.
Nay, by your Worships favour, I am bound to speak the truth, and the whole truth. But stay, where was I?


1.
Your friend and you were a going to drink, you said.


2.
O I, and then (an't like your Worship) we went to the Ca and Fiddle, and when we had drunk our flaggon a piece, and we were just a coming away, in came a neighbour of mine,stay,I shal hit on his name presently.


Iust.
Well, 'tis no matter for his name,but what of him?


2.
An't like your Worship, he would needs make us stay the drink|ing of his flaggon too; and by that time that was done, an't like your Worship, I began to think the shoulder of Mutton might be over|roasted, and therefore I made as much haste home as I could; and as I was coming along by the wall, imagining no hurt, nor thinking of no harm, O I saw the saddest and lamentable sight.


Iust.
What was that?


2.
I never saw so much all the dayes of my life.


Iust.
But what was it?


2.
And I hope I shall never see the like again.


Iust.
Nay, what was it?


2.
Why, An't like your Worship, I saw a proper, goodly young Gentleman, as one shall see in a year and a day, lye in the most yearnful

condition, all in gore bloud, that it would have grieved any heart to have seen the like; and then this same young man came.


Iust.
And what can you say friend? I think I have seen you som|where; is not Mr. Du-cape the Mercer your Master?



If it please your honourable worship, I am resident with Mr. Du-cape upon the account of a Journeyman.


Iust.
Cry mercy, but what say you?


1.
Why, if it please your honourable worship, as I was going a long upon a very civil account, to carry a piece of Satin to a person of Honour, in the Peazza, in Lincolnes Inne fields, just under the wall, I chanc't to cast my eyes and view the aforesaid Gent. whose name is Mr. Well-bred, in the self same condition as this man has before specified and declared, and I upon that account dee|ming him to be dead, did debate with my selfe upon what ac|count the said Man-slaughter should happen; but I approaching neer|er, did descry him to be one that had been a customer to my Master, and I upon that account knowing his lodging, did desire this same man that upon that account he would be instrumentall in conveying him thither. And when upon that account we be|gan to stirre him, his wound upon that account began to bleed with a most extreme violence, in so much that I seeing his hand|kerchiefe, hang out of his pocket, did upon that account judge it requisite to pull it out, to helpe stop his wound; and pulling it out, I chanced upon that account to pull out a letter, which this man desiring me to read 


2.
You may see that some are wiser then some.


1.
 Upon that account I read it, and finding it to bee a challenge, upon that account did I estimate this Gentleman to have fought a duel.


Iust.
Where is the letter?


1.
Here, if it please your honourable Worship.


Iust.
Read it Goos-quill.
Goos-quill reades.  Sir, I cannot but as I am a Gen|leman take notice of the affront you put on mee, in pretending to Mistris Crisis, to whom none living doth owe more service then my selfe; wherefore I desire that you would hence-forward desist, or else meet mee at the back side of Islington, with your friend and a Rapier, where I shall in the same manner attend you, about five of the clock. In the mean while, I rest,

Your humble Servant Thomas Know-well.

Iust.
will these bloody and inhumane duells never be left off? shall wee never but be thus barbarous one to another? as

if we were not men, but Butchers, Turks or Tartars.
What say you Sir, are not you the man that kill'd him? do you not know that blood requires blood?


Know.
Surely Sir there is some great mistake, for my part I have not seen the Gentleman this day.


Iust.
It will be well if that will serve your turn; I think the matter cannot be more cleere; Come Goos-quill make a Mittimus presently.


Know.
Sir, If you please, I shall produce some, in whose company I have been all this afternoone. Enter Crisis.


Cris.
Hold, hold, I beseech you Sir, let him stay a little.


Iust.
Mrs. Crisis! how doth your father, my very good neigh|bour?


Cris.
Very well Sir, he will be here shortly.


Iust.
But what is the matter, can you say any thing in this busi|nesse?


Cris.
Sir, only this, the Gentleman that Mr. Know-well here is sup|sed to have killed, is not dead.


Iust.
How! not dead?


Cris.
No Sir, He was only through much loss of blood, fainted away for a time; but now Sir, he is very well again, neither did hee give him the wound that he has, but he saith he had it in a quarrell that hapned between him, and some that he met in the fields.


Iust.
That is strange.


Cris.
Sir, If you will have but a little patience, there will be some here immediately that will cleer all things to you.


Iust.
Well then, stay a little.


People, 1.
What, must he not be hanged then?


2.
I'le warrant that Gentlewoman has beg'd him.


1.
Shee must be a pure virgin if shee have.


3.
They say he has bought his life for a thousand pounds, and then he to have a lease of it for fourscore years.


1.
There is a fine device indeed; this it is to be a Gentleman, I'le warrant one of us should have been hanged without more adoe.


Con.
Bear back there. 


Cris.
But Mr. Quorum, I hear you have stoln a wedding to day.


Iust.
Such things will be sometimes; Shee was a fortune meerly cast upon me.


Cris.
But shall not I have the happinesse to see your Bride in the mean time?


Iust.
Yes that you shall.
Goos-quill, go and desire your Mistris to come in.

Exit Goos-quill, and Enters presently with her and Had.

Had.
Speak but one word, you rogue, and I will cut your throat.

Know-well and Crisis salute her.

1.
Witnesse. Surely I should know her.

I, that is she without doubt. Looks on her.


Pate
Nay, 'Tis I.


Iust.
Do you know my wife?


1.
I have a little reason, for I am sure she ows my Master almost  pound.


Iust.
50 pound! that is nothing;  but I hope thou dost not owe many such debts, Chuck.


Pate.
Why, what if I do?


Iust.
Nay, nothing, but I hope not so. 


Pate.
What, am I examined already?


Iust.
Be not angry Love,  for I know thou hast wherewithall to pay them.


Pate.
Have I so? Were I disposed, how could I laugh to see how thou art cozend!


Iust.
Ha! Cozend!


Pate.
I cozen'd, thou old doting fool: could you ever imagine any thing else?


Know.
Hey da!


Iust.
Nay, but Honey, what do you mean? you are not in earnest, are you?


Pate.
In earnest? Do you think I am not? could you ever be so mad, as to think that I in my heat and strength of yeers could ever doe on thy dull frosty carcasse?


Iust.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.


Pate.
Do you think that I would mix my blood with thy cold flegmatick, gouy humours, had it not been to raise my sinking fortune, nd to keep me from those extremities of poverty, that did daily threaten me?


Iust.
Oh I am undone, I am undone, undone.


Pate.
And yet had my condition beene ten times worse, were I to be ty'd only to thy bed, I should repent the change.


Know.
A brave Girle I vow.


Pate.
For I already do begin to feel those warme desires that thou this many a year never hast been able to satisfie.


Cris.
Come, Master Know-well, let us goe into the next roome, she will make me blush' else.  Know. and Cris. Exeunt. As they are a going.


Pate.
What, are you going Sir, I hope now you know the house, I shall see you here sometimes, our yeers indeed would somewhat suit, and what ever we should chance to do, here is one must father all.


Cris.
O impudence!


Iust.
O patience, patience, patience, I shall run mad else, mad, mad, mad.


Had.
Now Sir, my revenge is perfect; do you not know mee?

Puts off his Perriwig.

Iust.
Mr. Had-land!



Had.
I, Do you not remember how some seven years ago you took the forfeiture of my Lands that were mortgaged to you, and ever since have unjustly kept me from them?


Iust.
O, I do remember, and confess this is a judgment, a Judgment.


Had.
I'le warrant her she is a judgment worse then either fam sword or the pestilence, or I am deceived. Enter Slur.


Slur.
You have wrong'd me, for I say mine was the first turn.


Pate.
Peace.


Slur.
Peace, you whore! I will not hold my peace.


Pate.
What, shall I be called whore in mine own house? out you roq Mr. Constable, I charge you to turn him out.


Sur.
Hee turn me out!stir but one inch you rogue, and you stir your last. Drawes.
And now I say, you are a whore, and a most damn'd whore.
And Sir, nothing so much grieves me, as that I have been the cause of helping you to this same strumpet.


Iust.
O Sir, what is shee? what is shee? let me know the worst, for I am prepared.


Slur.
That which I know of her, Sir, is this; I was first acquain|ted with her in the army, where I will assure you she was accounted a very necessary piece of ammunition, in some five nights, I think, shee would serve all our troop; since (Sir) shee has liv'd about the towne, no small sinner, shee has been as common as a Hackny Coach, and much about the same price, two shillings the first hour, and one shilling an hour after, as long as you will: shee is as prostituted as some moderne Workes, only they are spread upon the stalls in the day, and shee in the night.
Hold her.
And Sir, if the knowledg of men be the chiefest wisdome, believe she is not unwise, for in them she is not a little experienced;shee will tell you (I believe) the difference betwixt the melancholy, and the sanguine, the fair, or the black haired youth: shee could perhaps from her own knowledg, mend the observations of Culpepper, or Aristotles problems, tell who doth afford most pleasure the hot Italian, or the tough Germain, the nimble French-man, or the grave Spaniard.


Pate.
Why, you villain you, if through the frailty of my youth I have committed any of these kind of things, must every rogue tell me of it?


Slur.
On I go for all this  And Sir, about a yeer ago in this ser|vice, shee got a certain mischance, that you may guesse, insomuch, that what with her expences to the Surgeon and Apothecaries, together with the intermitting of her trade, shee was reduced to much poverty, and had incurred many debts.


Iust.
Debts!


Sl.
I, debts of all sorts, from her Mercer to her Milk-maid, all which have been some while forborne through the expectation of your paying them.



Iust.
Oh, oh, oh, what shall I do? here Goos-quill, take my knife, I don't know what I may do else.


Sl.
Believe me (Sir) you will have a very charitable imployment of it, you will pay many a pound that for a long while hath beene ac|counted desperate; but for you (Sir) many a poor man might have beene undone.


Pate.
This (Sir) wil be almost as good as founding Colledges, or building Churches.


Had.
And although you build no Hospitals, yet she may chance to find you imployment for Surgeons.


Pate.
You may in time to come, repair and make bridges for your nose.


Iust.
O thou damn'd perfidious whore.


Sl.
O Sir, she is perfidious indeed, if you know how shee has served mee.


Iust.
O How, how, how? let me hear, it will be some comfort to me to know any body else that has been cozend by her besides myself.


Sl.
Why (Sir) this Gentleman and I, (although for my part I must confesse, I do repent of what I have done) did much assist her in the accomplishing of this her design on you, for which in gratitude to us, and also in respect of your years, shee did agree, that we two should have a certaine kind of imployment (Sir) an ancient Roman office called Adju|tores thori, conjunctim  divisim, execute per vices, or by turnes; And (Sir) by the bargain I was to have the first turn; but shee (Sir) not minding the premises, fraudulently and maliciously, against all equity, justice, and good conscience, and against the true intent and meaning of the parties, hath let this Gentleman 


Goos.
I that she has, I'me sure; when you sent me for her, I caught them both upon the bed.


Iust.
Oh, oh, I shall never be able to endure: O give me my knife again, O give me it, I say.


Sl.
You had best, and be accessary to his death.


Iust.
Well, I am resolved on it; I know what I will do. Exit.


Sl.
Come, let us follow him, he may doe himselfe some mis|chiefe else. Exeunt.

Enter Pate, Slur, Had-land

Pate.
Which way went hee?


Had.
I cannot tell.


Slur.
Up staires, I thinke.


Pate.
Go after him, for Gods sake, and see whether you can find him. Exeunt.






with you. Mr. Constable, I charge you for to seize upon her.


Cast.
Hold, hold.


Iust.
Why?


Cast.
This is my reason; Discovers himself.
Was not I the man that married you?


Had.
Nay, Sir, it is a plaine case, yours was cleerly no mar|riage.


Iust.
Nay, then I see I am cozen'd.


Had.
You are indeed, Sir, I hope, for we have taken a great deal of paines in vaine else; I am sure we have been plotting this same business any time this month.


Iust.
Well, I do yeeld my selfe cozened, and am glad it is no worse.
And now Mr. Had land, I see you have wit to get an Estate, I hope you will have wit to keep it. You are one, I must confesse, of whose good parts I have heard divers times, and you shall shortly find, you have no more then I can well afford you.


Know.
And now, Sir, here the Gentleman hath made a shift to come hither in a Coach, that I was supposed to have killed.


Wel.
And here I do acquit him.
I must confesse, I had a challenge from him; but going for to meet him, I met with some other Gentleman, betweene whom and my selfe there chanced a certaine quarrel, in which I got the wound.


Know.
I challenged you! Certainly.


Lov.
Sir, do not wonder any longer, for I will resolve the doubt.
This Gentleman was this afternoon to go to a certaine place, whi|ther, if he had gone, I had beene for ever lot; wherefore I upon the sudden, not thinking of a better way, sent him that Chal|lenge in your name, only thereby to hinder his going,for which, Sir, I beg your pardon.


Cris.
Which I durst warrant, if it be but for my sake, you shall ob|tain.


Know.
Madam, you are so far from wanting pardon for what you have done, that to you I owe whatsoever happinesse I do expect in this same Lady.


Lov.
If, Sir, you owe any thing to me, I shall look for sa|tisfaction only in this same Gentleman, for whose sake I did what I did.


Wel.
I shall be, Lady, so far from quitting others scores, that what I owe you on mine own account, while I live, I shall never clear.


Pat.
Well, Mr. Had-land, I cannot but blush when I think

what a part you have made me act to day.


Had.
Thou hast done that this day (my Dear) that will eternally oblige me.


Slur.
Madam, I hope you will pardon what I said today, knowing to what end it was spoken; for there is not that Lady in the world of whom I have more honourable thoughts, then I have of you.


Pat.
I am sure I never gave you cause to have other.

Enter two Gentlemen.

Iust.
How now Sirs? What would you have?


1.
Sir, we come to demand your assistance against a couple of knaves that are here, that this afternoon have cheated us of almost a hundred pounds.


Iust.
Which be they?


2.
Here is one.


1.
And this is the other.


Iust.
Have they cheated you, say you?


1.
Yes that they have.


Iust.
What say you, Gentlemen?


Slur.
Your Worship (I hope) by experience knowes, that such a thing may not be altogether impossible.


Iust.
Well, Gentlemen will you refer the businesse to me, upon that condition, that I do please you all?


1.
I, Sir, upon that condition; but we shall not be pleased without our money.


Iust.
Why, then I order you to give them their money.


Slur.
But then we shall not be pleased.


Iust.
Yes, but you shall: for now I am resolved upon a design, which I hope will be as good as building Hospitals.
Gentlemen, by the carriage of this businesse, I see you have more in you then ever I did take you for to have. And although you have been wild in your time, yet now I believe you would know how to value an estate.
First therefore, as for you Mr. Had- Land, what you have gotten by this device from me, I freely will let you enjoy.
And for these Gentlemen, I will give them that which shall maintaine them like themselves without these shifts.
To be short, Gentlemen, I have an Estate and never a child, and if you henceforward do nothing that may displease me more then this your dayes work hath done, I shall not be wanting in any thing that you may expect from a father. What, doth this please you?


Slur.
Beyond our expectation.


Cast.
We, Sir, shall never be able to deserve this.


Iust.
Come, come, you have deserved it already.



Cast.
What strange accidents have hapned this day!

Enter Goosquil, and Whispers to the Iustice.

Iust.
O I, 'tis true, I did not think of it.
Mr. Hadland, there is a Supper ready within, which I did cause to be provided as for my Wedding Supper; but since you have got my Bride, you must e'en take the Supper too.
Gentlemen, will you please to walk?


Old Cris.
Then here we do begin the round; tomorrow my daugh|ter and this Gentleman say, you must be at my house.


Wel.
The next day after I do invite you.


La.
And I the next day after that.


Iust.
March then in, and as you your Weddings make, In the same order now your places take. Exeunt.
