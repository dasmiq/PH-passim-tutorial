LEaue-of / Leaue-of  / and quiet you nowe in thissame Day O all yee People vpon Earth; in all your Exercy|singe-of-warre and Tumulte of Battaile / Seeing that it is doubt|les; all vnprofitable and Eccle 12. consumeable / wherabout yee destroye you / and make Warre one against another / And Esa. 55. a. Ioel. 2. b. Eccli. 5. b. Math. 18. a. turne you about bytimes to the peaceable Howse of the Loue of Iesu Christ / to the Concorde and Peace of you all / ere-euer yee be vtterlie vanquished by the Iniquitie and swallow|ed-vp by the Eccli. 5. b. Rom. 2. b. Wrath of God.
2. Leaue-of now also / and quiet you in this Day O all yee Wise and Scripture learned; in all your Contention 1. Tim. 1. a. 2. Tim. 2. b. c. Tit. 3. a. b. and Disputinge one against another / Seeinge that the Argumentes wherabout yee con|tend / striue / and dispute the one against the-other / are all darke Esa.  b. Math. 11. d. 13. b. and secreat before your Eyes / Eares / and Vnderstandinges / And turne you about by|times to the peaceable Howse of the Loue of Iesu

Christ / and walke in the Ier. 13. b. Iohn. 12. d. e. true Light of his godlie Doctrine / ere-euer yee be vtterlie . 94. b. Heb. 3 4. b. hardened in your Heartes destroyed or cleene brought-to-confusion by the Darknesses / eauen Math. 25. d. Apo 20 d. into the Bottomles-pit and 2. . 1. c. bannished from the Cleernes of the vncouered Face of God / into the Condemnation.
3. FOr that cause O all yee People vpon Earth / Rulers and Commonaltie / with all Wise and Scripture-learned; geeue now good eare heerto /  take it to heart / and vnderstand what serueth you all vnto Luk. 19. c. Peace: And haue now all a good regard to the godlie Testimonies of y^e Truth / which flowe out of the holie Spirit Iohn. 7. d. of Iesu Christ / and are setfourth out of his Seruice of Loue.
4. Which holie Spirit with his Windes of god+lie Testimonies / is now in this Daye blowinge or breathing downe vnto vs / fro~ the Face of the Lord / and from the Seate of his godlie Maiestie: wher|in the Scripture becometh fulfilled in this present Daye / like as ther standeth writen therof:
5. A Spirit Esa. 57. b. shall blowe-fourth from my Face / and I will make Breath / saith the Lorde.
6. Therfore geeue-eare now / and comprehend in your Heartes / what thesame Spirit saith from the Face of the Lorde / and publisheth to the Peace and Blessing of all People. For thus saith thesame ho|lie Spirit / which breatheth-downe from the Face of the Lorde:
 7. THe God of Heauen hath de|termined to erect and establish vpon the Earth / for euermore yow in the last Esa. 2. a. Ioel. . a. Mh 4. a. Act. 2. b. time; the Peace and Blessing of all the Gene|rations of the Earth / vnder the Obedience of his

Loue / like as Hee hath heertofore promised through the holie Fathers / and his Propheates Gen. 22. b. Luk. . g. Abraham and his Seede.
8. Therfore biddeth Her now all People / that they turne them away Esa. 55. a. Eze. 18. d. Act. 17. d. from the Iniquitie / shewe|fourth vpright Math. 3. a. Luk. 3 a. Act. 2. d. 3. c. Fruites of Repe~taunce / and hum|ble their Heartes vnder the Obedience of the Ser|uice of his Loue / and so enter into the Waye of Life and Peace / To thende that the true Loue both towardes God and their Neighbour; maye haue a beeing like Iohn. 14. . 15. b. 17. c. Eph. 3. c. Shape in them.
9. For the true Loue towardes God and our Neighbour / Deu. 30. d. is the true Life: and thesame Life / is a true Iohn. 1. a. Light of Men: and that Light of Life / is the true Iohn. 1. c. 1. Iohn. 2. b. Loue itself.
10. Thesame true Loue / is the Delight or Good-pleasure of the Lorde / and the Fulnes or Perfection of the Life.
11. Thesame Loue / is also God-his Paradice the Pleasant-garde~ of the Lorde wherin the Tree of Gen. 2. a. Psal. 1. a. Vse with his Growing / standeth fast / and brin|geth-fourth his lyuinge Fruites / to an euerlastinge Rest and Ioye of Life.
12. BEholde / and consider: This Rest and  Ioye of Life / in the Loue / this Daye of Loue / wherout the true Cleernes of God / and his heauenlie Goods are declared / is now appered / and brought fro~ the Grace of the Lorde; vnto Vs Lit|tle ones and God-his Elect / vnder the Obedience of his Loue: and in thesame Hee hath reioyced vs.
13. Which Day or Light of Loue / and of euer|lasting Ioye / wee publish now to a Math. 24. b. Marc. 16. c. Apo. 14. b. ioyfull Ty|dinges of the Kingdom of Peace, in all the World / to the Blessing of all the Generations of the Earth / 

To thentent that eueryone which adioyneth him to y^e Loue  her Seruice; mought haue the Fulnes of Iohn. 10. . Life / through the Loue / that his Ioye may Iohn. 1. b. 16. d. 17 b. c. 1. Iohn. 1. a. be perfect / and that hee maye obtaine the Peace and Blessinge / accordinge to the Promises.
14. Take now all good-heede to this Daye of Loue / and consider well theron / what hee, out of the Seruice of his Loue; requireth: and Iohn. 8. c. 12 d e. 1. Iohn. 2. b. walke eauenso obedientlie in y^e Light of y^e same / that yee stumble not.
15. Runne not fourth in y^e Darknes / that yee erre not in the Bywaies / nor fall on the Vncene~-places.
 16. For beholde / There 1. Cor. 4. a. Apo. 18. a. appeereth now vnto Vs a Light from on-high / with Bright-beames of Cleernes / ouer the whole Earth: the which is the Daye of Loue / that God hath constituted / or|dained / or appointed / In Act. 17. d. which Hee will iudge the Compasse of the Earth / with Righteousnes / tho|rough one Man / in whom Hee hath decreed it: which holdeth-fourth the Beleef before eueryone / seeinge that God hath raysed Him from the Death / to thende that the Scripture mought be fulfilled.
17. LEt now all Iew. 19 b. Esa. 57. d. 62. Stumbling-stones / which are laide to cause the Blinde to stumble / be don out of the Waye: and let eauenso all what is vnee|uen on the Waye / be made plaine / To thende that the Blinde hurt not themselues on the Waye / ne|ther stumble nor fall.
18. Let now all High-places Esa. 40. a. Math. 3. a. and Valleyes be made very eeue~ and plaine / on the Way to the Life: Let now all Mountaines / Highplaces / and Little-hilles be cast-downe: And let now all Valleys and Dales be highthened or filled-vpp / To thend that ther may be euery-wheare an eeuen and free Path / and a good and peaceable Walkinge / to the Life in

the Peace. and that the Num. 14. Mich. 5. Glorie of the Lorde maye becom great / and inlardge itself wyde-abrode ouer all Landes. So shall then Esa. 52. Luk. 3. all Fleash beholde the Saluation of God / accordinge to the Promises.
19. This is the Woorde of the Lorde / Esa. 2. . which  Hee hath spoke~ in times-past / to a righteous Iudg|ment / in the last Dayes / To thend that it all should geeue itself to the Preseruation. namelie / vnder the Winges of the Loue: wher-vnder eueryone shall dwell free / Mich. 4. . without feare /  be defended fro~ all Hin|deraunce or Daunger / according to the Promises.
20. LEt now all destroyinge Weapons / be don out of the Sight of the Eyes / to thende that the Children or Youngones wound not them|selues / and that the Elders make no lenger Battell.
21. Let eueryone lay-away now from him / his Weapons of Warre / and geeue him vnto Rom. 12. Heb. 12. Peace: and be ioyfull / because of the great Grace / Tit. 1. which is now made-manifest and com vnto Vs.
22. For beholde / The Esa. 61. a. Luk. 4. Golden-yeare appeereth now vnto Vs / that free acceptable Yeare of the Lorde / to the Releassing and Setting-free of all the Lordes People [namelie / of all y^e Tribes of Israell] to the Blessing of all y^e Generations of the Earth /  to the Saluatio~ of all Heathen / for that the Scrip|ture mought be fulfilled / according to y^e Promises.


The Seconde Chap.
TAke now 2. Cor. 6. a. good-heede to this accep|table  Time the free Yeare wherin eue|ryone is called and bidden / to com to Leui. 25 a. Deu. 15. a. Esa. 49.60. d. his right Inheritaunce / vnder the Obedience of the Loue / To thend that eueryone may possesse in

Freedo~ / that which belongeth vnto him / and obtaine thesame / whervnto hee is Gen. 1.2. Sap. 2. . 17. . created / And that it may all eauenso be inhabited, vnder the Obedience of the Loue, in Peace / through y^e mightie  52. c. 66. Hand of y^e Lord.
2. Let eueryone prepare him now to the Eph. 1. b 4. Col. 3. b. vpright Beeing / whervnto hee is created of God. For loe / God Gen. 1. Sa. 1.   9. 1. . 4. a. hath created All / that is anything / each-one to his Ordinaunce and Righteousnes / and to the Preseruation of the Life / To thende that it shoulde go-well with eueryone / and that they mought liue free without Sap 1. destruction. and so God to haue the Praise of all / through the Loue.
3. THerfore heare the Woorde of the Lorde / yee all which now make Battaile / or are Men-of-warre all yee Nobles / Lordes-of-the-campe / Capitaines / Horsmen and Souldyers / and all which deale with Weapons-of-warre / to the vse of Battaile: Make now Plowsheares Isa 2. a. Math. 4. a. / of your Sweardes / and Sickles / of your Speares / For to plowe all wildernessed Land / and to prepare all vn|prepared or vntilled Fieldes / to a mollified Earth / To thentent that Bread-corne may be sowen ther|in / and multiplie itself through the Rayne  Dewe of Heauen: and that meete or apt Deu. 28.  Zah 1. a. Fruites may ea|uenso be reaped and gathered of all Landes / To the end that ther may be alwaies Bread-corne in-store / to a Foode of Satisfyinge / and that the Children of Men may alwayes haue Isa. 33. . 5. Bread for to liue by.
 4. Looke to it bytimes / er euer the Amos. . a. great Hunger or Lacke of Bread fall ouer the Lande / that yee all (whe~ the Hunger cometh) pine not away: but may then haue Corne for your Food /  Bread to liue by.
5. Wherfore consider now / that the Land is ve|ry hade / and the  a. b. 33. b. Earth / very stubbourne: in such-sort

/ that for the Hardnes cause; the Fieldes are waren dry / and becom vnfruitfull of y^e good Seede.
6. Although the Raine and Dewe fall thervp|on / yet notwithstanding thesame soketh not ther-in / to the Moisteninge of the Earth.
7. Albeit that Seede be sowen theron / yet cometh it not to Fruitfulnes.
8. And although the Seede gett a little Grow|inge therin / yet hath it not any Math. 25. Mark. 4. Luk. 8. Deapnes of roote: and cannot therfore endure the Heate of y^e Sunne.
9. For that cause it ether withereth of itself: or|els the Esa. 5. b. 32. c. Math. 13. Thistles and Thornes keepe it downe: so that it getteth not his Fulnes of rype Seede / to Fruitfulnes. For it hath not any Growing-vpp to his Perfection / Because the Earth is so vtterlie vn|prepared / and desolated with Abhominations.
10. SEeing now that the Earth is not plow|ed / nor prepared to bring-fourth Frute / therfore lyeth the Lande euery-wheare thus 4. Esd. 16. wil|dernessed / and vnfruitfull of good Corne 3. Reg. 18. . Ier. 12.14. a. am. 2.4. a.. There is scarcelie any-wheare Corne to be founde / for to sustaine the Life of Men.
11. Oh! What a Woe / 4. Esd. 15.16 Esa. 24. Apo. 8. Calamitie and Mise|rie cometh-ther ouer the poore People which dwell vpo~ the Earth / and seeke out of y^e vnprepared Earth / which bringeth-fourth nothing-els but Math. 13. Weedes / Thistles Gen. 3. d. Heb. 6. / and Thornes; their Meate for Foode and their Peace on Earth / through Exercisinge-of-warre. and consider not that the Earth is Gen. 3. d. Deu. 28. curssed / for the Wickednes cause of the People: and therfore lyeth barren of Corne / to the Foode of Life / and vt|terlie voyde of the Peace of Christ. And if ther com not any other Prouision into the Mindes or Vn|derstanding of the Rulers of the Earth / and of the

People which dwell theron / so must they all Psa. 8. d. Ier. 14. a. Iam. 1.4. pyne-away / Heb. 6. inherit the Curssinge with the Earth / and perish in great Miserie.
 12. WHerfore learne yee not now in this pe|rillous tyme; to vse som right Vnder|standinge / to a good Prouision of Bread / O yee Kinges of the People?
13. Wherfore vse yee now no Prudencie / O yee Counsel-lordes ouer the Countries / to thende that the People mought gett Bread / and liue peaceablie ther-with?
14. Wherfore thinke yee not bytimes / what is most profitable or needfull for you: and wherby yee mought liue longest in Peace / O yee Men-of-warre / yee all which now make Battaile? For loe / yee let the Lande lye wast: and haue turned / armed / and prouoked yourselues to Battaile / one against an-other.
15. Yee slaye one another of you / with your Swerdes. yee destroye each-other / with your Speares. and consider not that the Lande lyeth-wast and waxeth-wilde by itselfe.
16. THerfore awake bytimes / and looke into the Destruction your-selues. Esa. 1. a. O . d. Zach. 9. Breake now your Swerdes and Speares to-peeces: and forge your Swerdes into Plowsheares / and your Speares into Sickles: and geeue you to the Till|inge-of-the-grounde / for to plowe the Earth / and to prepare thesame vnto Fruitfulnes of Seede.
17. Bide no-lenger Men-of-warre one against another: but becom Tillers-of-the-grounde / and bringe the Earth Gen. 1. vnder you / to Fruitfulnes / that it may bring-fourth good Seede / for to liue by / So shall yee then in the time of Haruest; haue much to

reape 2. Cor. 5. Gal. 6. / and obtaine great Riches: and all Peace shall meete you.
18. But if yee do not so: nor yet consider / that it  is presentlie no time of Warre or Battaile / that can profite any man any-thinge at all in these Dayes / for to obtaine Peace  Foode of Life vpo~ the Earth: but will gett your liuing with the Swerd / So shall yee yourselues according to the Woord of y^e Lord; perish therthrough / or be Math. 16. slaine with the Swerde.
19. It is true / wee haue hearde that Christ spake / in times-past; to his Disciples / saying / Luk. 1. Whoso hath a Wallet / let him take it: in like-maner also a Scrippe: But hee that hath none / let him sell his Cote / and bye a Swerde. But now saith the Loue of Christ: Whoso hath a Swerde / let him not sell it: but forge it / Esa. 2. . Oe. 2. d. Zach. 9. c. make therof a Plowsheare / and be|com an Husbandman. For it must all be fulfilled / whatsoeuer is writen of Christ Luk. 22. d. 24. g. / To thentent that the Ende or Fulfillinge of all that is writen / 4. d. 5. 1. Cor. 1. 1. Tim. 1. a. may be the Loue.
20. This is the euerlastinge Esa 32. d. 54. d 66 d. Peace / according to the Scripture. For what is writen of Mee / saith Christ / Luk. 12. d. hath an Ende or Fulfilling. and that Ende or Fulfillinge / Iohn. 17. d. 1. Cor. 13. b. 1. Tim. 1. a. is the Loue which bideth for euer / accordinge to the Promises.
21. Therfore looke into the Tyme / and consider well wherto the Promises stretch. Not verelie; to That which goeth before and ceasseth: but to the Tocominge / that ceasseth not / but shall bide for euermore.
22. For although in the Time when Swerdes were needfull or required / ther were Luk. 22. d. two Swerdes founde / yet is notwithstandinge the Ende promised to be in Esa. 9. a. 32. d 57.60. d. 66. Dan. 2. d. Eph. 2. c. Peace / vnder the Loue.



The Thirde Chap.
 IF hee then O hee Warriours; con|sider not heer-on / nor forge your Swerdes into Plowsheares. but will gett the Victo|rie with the Swerde / so shall it not prosper with you. For ther shall now no Protection nor Peace be founde / vnder your Swerdes / but onlie vnder the Loue: wherin the Lorde  from the Be|gining; hath preordained and determined thesame.
2. But if yee will now in this New and grati|ous Daye of Loue; yeat fight and make Warre one against another / and not once cal-to-minde the to|cominge Deut. 28. . 8. Hunger / which shall O all yee Men-of-warre; fall vpon you therout / when-as yee are bee vtterlie-weerye and tyred in your Warre or Fight|inge / So thinke then vpon the Infelicitie and Mis|fortune which is published vnto you before.
3. For beholde / the Dayes com / sayth the holie Spirit of Loue yea / they are alredie in the doore; that your 4. Esd. 6. Binnes or Ambries shall be found with out Bread / and your Barnes without Corne: that your Lightes also shall Iob. 18. a 1. b. 8. b. Pro. 1 a 24. go-out / and that yee like the Math. . a. foolish Virgins; hauinge no Oyle in your Lampes / shall finde yourselues buried in the Dark|nes / like vnto the Dead.
4. At that time verelie / much Calamitie  Esa. 13. a. Mi|serie shall com vpon you: and much Land shall then lye so vtterlie wast / that it cannot be tilled againe: and as a Wildernesse; be ouergrowen with Pro 24. a. 5. Thi|siles and Thornes. and yee shall be constrained to beholde with great Sap. 5. 2. Discomforte / the Miserie of yourselues / the Cursse of the Wicked / and the Ma|lediction of the Earth / and greatlie lament and be|wayle

your-selues / with Wringinge-handes / that yee haue not harkened vnto the Pro. 5. b. Counsell of the Elders in the Seruice of Loue / nor ben obedi|ent vnto the holie Spirit of Loue / nor to his godlie Testimonies.
5. Seeing then that yee haue loued yourselues /  followed-after Ier. 7. c. 9. c your owne Counsell / accordinge to the Minde of your Good-thinkinge / Lustes / and Desires / and Pro. 1. c. dispised the proffered Grace of the Loue of Iesu Christ / So shall yee also plainlie per|ceaue / that the Wisdome raigneth not by you / and that yee haue not the true Ier. 8. a. Woord of the Lorde / li|uinglie in you: and shall eauenso finde yourselues shutt without the Kingdom of the Loue / and sepera|ted and Sap. 5. a. estraunged from all louelie Beeinge.
6. THerfore Eccle. 3. haue now a regarde vnto this Time / wherin the Loue and Equitie is exercised / and the Vertues required: and consider what is most profitable or needfull for you / and take Warninge. For beholde / it goeth presentlie / eauenlike as the God of Heauen hath heer-to-fore spoken therof / through his holie Propheates.
7. If therfore the Children of Men conuert not / nether yet leaue-of from their Follie and Errour / So shall then all the Rom. 2. b. Euell or Infelicitie which is for to com ouer y^e Vngodlie / fall also as a Luk. 21. Snare; vpon them. For the Swerdes are Psal. 37. alredie naked / and drawne out of the Scabbardes: and eueryone is busylie occupied with his Speare.
8. All that is any-what / and can beare Sticke or Staffe (whether hee be younge or olde / little or great) will now fight / and applieth him vnto Bat|taile 4. Esd. 6. b. 1. d. 15. b. c. 16.  Math. 24. b. for to make Warre: and getteth him a stowte Courraige to the Exercisinge-of-warre / for to take-in-hande

and atchiue Martial-affaires / boldlie and without discomfiture.
 9. Therfore cometh-ther a great Alarme and Murder-crye ouer the Landes: Iere. 25. d. Ioel. 1. a. b. Amos. 8. b. Soph. 1. b. For the Heartes of the People are kindled to Battaile. They shall fall on the Edge of their Swerdes / and slaye Nah. 3. a. 4. Esd. 16 c. Luk. 21. c. one-another vpon the Earth.
10. But after that shall the great Hunger com: little Amos. 8. b. Corne be founde to liue by: and the People shall seeke Lam. 2. d. 4. Bread / for to sustaine their Life withall.
11. But alas; when the great Hunger and Dearth or Lack of Bread shall fall vpon them / then shall they be fayne to feed themselues with Ier. 6.8. b. 3 d. . d. 29 b. Ezech. 13. b. c. straunge Bread: Howbeit / not finde nor com-by the Satis|fyinge or Fulnes of the Life ther-out.
12. When they then ware hungrye againe / and knowe-well that they cannot liue by the straunge Breade / nor be satisfyed therwith / So shall their Soules Lam. 2. c. 4. a fainte or be vnlustfull / through the strau~ge Bread / and much euell Corruption of the Pestilence shall take-holde of them.
13. Than whatsoeuer dyed not of Hunger / and whatsoeuer is escaped the Swerde / and ye at remai|ned-ouer therfrom / shall, through bitter Wofulnes; in great Luk. 21. d. Desperation or Faint-heartednes / seeke to dye Iere. 7. d. O. 10. a. Luk. 23. c. Apoc. 9. a. of the stronge Pestilence (wherwith they shall be caught) for to auoyde the great Infelicitie of the Vngodlie / and the Miserie which shall take-hold of them: yet shall they not be able to escape y^e Plagues.
 14. At that time shal-men count them happyer that are Lam 4.2. slayne with the Swerde / then they that shall remayne-ouer to the stronge Pestilence.
15. And vpon all such as stand not submitted vn|der the Obedience of the Loue. nor humbled vnder

the Preseruation of the Seruice of Loue / shall all this fore-sayed Infelicitie not faile to com: and they shall Ier. 42. b. Apoc. 9. a. not be able to auoyde nor escape thesame.
16. THer shall also great Tribulation / Afflic|tion / and Miserie be beholden / in all I|landes / because they haue not sought in the Seruice of Loue; the vpright Wayes of the Lord / nor loued the Life of Righteousnes / Esa. 5. d. 4. Esd. 7. c. nor yet had any desire to the Seruice of Loue but Pro. 1. c. refused /  resisted or sclau~+dered thesame / and eauenso turned-back themselues: Going-fourth according to their Deut. 9. a. Ier. 7. c. 9. b. Goodthinkinge.
17. But what auayleth it / their Goodthinkinge will yet in the end / betray / deceaue / and begyle them all: Howbeit manye of them will not presentlie be|leeue thesame. But when-as the Plagues haue caught them / then shall they vnderstand thesame in great Sap. 5. a. Miserie / and in their Miserie; rufullie la|ment / that they haue so shamefullie neglected the proffered Grace / dispised the Good / and not geeuen-care to the Pro. 5. b. Instructions of the Seruice of Loue / nor yet taken-heede to the Godlynes of thesame.
18. For they shall beholde and knowe / that the olde Heauen wherin they put their trust; and the olde Earth whervpon they haue buylded; shall all be Esa. 51. b. 66. . Pet.  b. Apoc. 21. a. consumed with the Fyre. and her Elementes melte / through the Heate of thesame.
19. But the Loue shall remaine in her Seruice / as a fast Stony-rocke: which Loue / in her Seruice can 1. Cor. 13. a. begyle noman. For in her Seruice / shee is a sure vnremoueable Stay and Salfgarde / and her Counsell is vndeceitfull: for Shee is nothinge-els in herself / but Life and Peace.
20. Therfore shall it all whatsoeuer is or beco~|eth  vsed without the Loue and her Seruice; ceasse / 

and be chaunged / and consume or vanish-awaye. But the Loue in her Seruice / shall 1. Cor. 13. b remaine for-e|uer: and all what is of-one-minde with the Loue / shall neuer perish. but obtaine the eternall Life / and possesse thesame euerlastinglie.
21. SEeinge now that the Loue is the Plea|sant-garden of the Lorde / so shall they all that are of-one-minde with her verteous Na|ture / haue the Vnitie with the Loue / and liue accor|dinge to the Lust or Will of the Lorde.
22. They shall eate of all the Trees of the Lord-his Pleasant-garden / and of the Tree Gen. 2. b. Apoc. 2. a. 2. of Life / which standeth in the middest of the Paradice of God / and liue euerlastinglie.
