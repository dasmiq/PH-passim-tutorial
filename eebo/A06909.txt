To the ryght ho|norable and vertuous Lady, Anne Grey, Theodore Basille wissheth longe yfe, contynual helth, and prosperous e licitie. 
_IT is not without an vr+gent and moost necessa|rye cause that we are so ofte commau~ded in the moost sacred  holy Bi|ble to match  praye.Ma xxvi Mar. xiii. i. Pet. iiii. Ephe. vi. For yf we that professe our selues to be souldiours of Christes arm do seriously  w^tout saynynge ponder, weye  consyther our state  maner of lyuyng in this world, we shall shortly be occasione to confesse and graunte with the ho|ly  pacient man Iob,Iob. vii that the lyfe of man is nothynge els than a very knyghthode or warrefare vpon the erth, full of misery  trouble, replete

with lytle ioe  plesure. christen man hath many ene|myes i this worlde. To whom is it vnknowen what a great multi+tude of mortall ennemies euery one hath  this world, that doth professe Christ aright? Among al other haue we not thre capital  chefe aduersa|ries, the dyuell, the world,  the flesh, whiche cease not dayly to assayle vs after the moost crafty  subtyle ma|ner? Howe doth Satan spreade his nettes in euery Forreste  Parke,The deuel. y^ no dere maye escape his deuouryng teth  rauenyng pawes? Howe ma+ny wayes seketh he to destroye, kyll and say the innoce~t shepe of Christ?en. iii. Euen fro~ the beginnyng of y^ world hath he exercised his tyrannicall fu|ry,  furious tyranye agaynst man|d. Who hath at any tyme ben free, were he neuer so good  perfecte, fro~ his subtile  to much craftye assaul|tes? He is so be~t  ferue~tly addict to the destruccion of man, that so sone as we are regenerate  borne anew

n Christ by the holy Ghost,  y^ most blessed  honorable Sacramente of Baptisme, he streyght falleth in ha~d with vs, labouryng by one meanes or other vtterly to allure  entise vs from our profession, as we may se in our sauyour  LORDE Iesus Christ,Mat. iiii. Mar i. Luke, iiii whome after his Baptisme Satan dyd not feare to assayle and to te~pte vnto muche absurditie and wicked|nes. f the sonne of God were not free from his crafte, subtilite  gyle, howe shall we than miserable creatu+res eschewe his tyranny, whiche are redy to faull at euery houre, excepte we watche and praye. Our stryfe is not,Ephe. vi. sayth S. Paule, agaynst bloud  flesshe, but agaynst rulers, against the powers, agaynste the Lordes of the world, I mene, the gouernours of y^e darkenes of this world, agaynst spirituall subtilities in heaue~ly thi|ges. Therfore sayeth S. Peter:i. Pet. v. Be ye sober and watche, for your aduer+sary

the dyuel goeth about lyke a ro+ryng Lyon sekynge whome he maye deuoure.
The worldMoreouer what an extreme ene+my is the worlde to so many as pro|fesse Christe? Howe many occasions haue we thorowe the entysementes and vayne pleasures therof to faull from the true godlynes? Howe doth it allure vs to the loue of transitory thynges? Howe doth it delyghte vs with the beholdyng of the vayne spe+ctacles therof? Howe doth it drawe vs to the loue of mundane thynges,  to the vtter contempt of thynges celestiall and heauenly? ea how al|moost doth it wynne vs altogyther on her syde? Wha~ the scripture not withstandyng sayeth:i. Ioan. ii. Loue not the world, nor those thynges that are in the worlde. If ony man louethe the worlde, the loue of the father is not in hym. For all that is in the world, as the concupiscence of the flesshe, 

the lust of the eies,  the pryde of the lyfe, is not of the father, but it is of the world. And the world passeth a|waye,  y^e lustes therof. But he that dothe the wyll of God, abyde the for euermore.Iacob. iiii. S. Iames also sayeth: O ye adulterers and alulteresses, do ye not knowe that the frendeshyp of y^e world, is emnite with God? Who soeuer therfore wyll be the freende of the world, he is become an enemy of Gods.
The flesh.Furthermore what a cruell ad|uersary is the flesshe vnto a christen man?al. v. Howe doth it at all tymes lust contrary to the spirite? Howe doth it continually fyght with the heaue~+ly mocions of the holy Ghost? Howe dothe it moue vs to the loue of oure selues, to pryde, vncleannesse, gloto|ny, couetousnesse, wantonnesse of ly+uynge, vnmercifulnesse, crudelite,  al that euer nought is? And this ene+my do we norysshe in oure owne bre|stes.

He is a domesticall aduersarye  one of houshold as they vse to say. He is euer at hande to do vs displea|sures. He is neuer fro~ home, but al|wayes within the dores, so that we are in daunger of destruccion at eue+ry hour, excepte we delige~tly watch and take hede.O the vn|speakeable miserye of man, wyth+out y^ grace of God. Whyther so euer we turne vs, our enemies mete with vs  so cruelly assayle vs, that excepte the grace of God assyst vs valeaunt|lye, we are at euerye moment of an houre redy to be caste into hell fyre. O the vnspekable misery of man in this moost miserable worlde.Take hde o pastor|nr of Gods worde.

Wher are these abhominable adulterers, vncleane fornicatours, and stynckyng whore+mongers, which conte~nyng y^e bonde of honorable wedlocke, the lawe of y^e vndefyled bed,  the chast lyuyng w^e theyr owne wyues,He. xiii. do dayely hunte after whores, defile virgins, pollute maried women, corrupte wydowes, as I maye passe ouer much other de|testable vncleannes,O extreme abhomina+cion. whiche it sha|meth not the~ to
perpetrate and do

yea  that so boldely that this synne of fornicacio~ is among many at this present recou~ted no synne, but a na|turall inclinacion, a token of loue, a puttyng awaye of emnite  discord? I thynke yf it be not redressed short|ly, it wyl growe vp into such freedo~e  libertie, that it shalbe counted no synne at all, but rather a vertue, or at the leest a spurre  prouocacio~ to vertue. O the abhominacion of the worlde. O intollerable wickednes. O vncleannes more detestable, then it maye any lenger be suffered.Beware ye abhomi+nable who remo~gers betymes. The great displeasure, the fearce wrath, the extreme vengeaunce, the fearce and cruell plages of God hang ouer our heades, yf this to much detesta|ble vyce be not shortely remoued fro~ the bou~des of Christianite.

O the countenau~ce of the christen pub+ligue weale, not a litle deformed tho+rowe the pernicious maners of the false christians. Thus se we what a nomber of mortal enemies reigneth euery where among vs,  yet is ther no man that lame~teth his synne,Awake, awake. de|esteth his wickednes, bewaileth his misery, desyreth amendment, seketh for grace, prayeth for the fauoure of God, that thorowe the holy Ghoste we may be restored to our olde puri|e  cleannes.Prouer. xi. i.

O that we would followe y^ godly counsell of this holy Apostle,  so re|dresse our wicked maners, y^ the chri+sten publigue weale myght be resto|red to her olde amiable beauty  glo+rious pleasaunce.Wayes to obtayne Gods fa|oure. Howe many way|es hathe God lefte here amonge vs, wherby we maye make him a merci+full father,  a gentle sauyour vnto vs? As I maye leaue of to speake of fastynge  almes dede, what a good+ly

 godlye meane is true  christen prayer.Of prayer Note well. for to obtayne the fauour of God,  to prouoke his moost tender mercy toward vs? Hath ony thinge  tymes past so greatly apesed the de+uine wrath? did not y^ holy fathers  tymes pas  theyr troubles aduer+sitie fly vnto Prayer, as vnto a holy Anchore, or sure Asile,  strong Bul+wark? Whom would it not delight to talke with the Kinges grace, if he were amytted therto? What a trea|sure than is it to talke with y^e King of Kynges  Lorde of Lordes, in co~|parison of whom all earthly creatu|res are more vyle then the wormes? This thyng co~meth to passe by true and christen prayer.What pa  For what other thynge is prayer, than a familiar co~+municacio~ w^t God, wherin we maye frely powre out the troubles of our hertes, and declare all our matters boldly to him, as the chylde doth vn+to his father,  obtayne at his hand

all good thinges. Uerely we are our owne enemies, yf we neglecte  des|pyse this great commodite  singu|lar pleasure? We can not excuse our selfe by ygnorancy, in asmuch as we haue plentie of prayers prepared for vs in the Englysshe tonge both in y^ holy Byble,  in other godly treaty+ses, which are nowe in this moost flo+ryshyng Realme of England publy|shed vniuersally vnto y^ great glory of God,  y^ exceading consolacion of al true christen men, in asmuch that as S. Paule sayeth:ii. Cor. iiii. If the Gospell be yet hyd, t is hydde in the~ that pe+rysh, in whom the God of this world hathe blynded they senses  wyttes of the vnfaythfull, that the lyght of the Gospell of the glorye of Christe, which is the Image of God, shoulde not shyne vnto them. Thanckes be to God for this his inco~parable be|nefyte gyuen vnto vs by his welbe|loued  faythfull seruaunte Hepe

oure moost redoubted Kynge. That LORDE myghte also graunt that we abuse not this his moost ge~tle gifte, but rather vse it vnto the glorye of his name, y^ edificacio~ of his church,  the conforte of our soules.
owe for asmuch as ther is suffi|cie~cy of praiers prepared alredy  set forth by other, whom God myght al+so prosper in theyr moost godly affai+res. A thought it a vayne thynge to encrease the nomber of the~,  to acu|mulate prayers vpon prayers, wher by wexines rather then cherefulnes shoulde be brought to the Readers I therfore couetyng in this behalfe to worke somewhat y^e myghte make vnto the auauncemente of Prayer, wherby the deuout Christia~s might receyue knoweledge,  be the better instructed in the true maner of prai+enge, haue nowe of late compyled a worke entiteled,A pathway vnto pray+er A pathwaye vnto Prayer. I was the gladder to take

it in hande, bycause no man hath as yet perfectly entreated of this mat|ter, neither in the Greke,The cause of makyng this worke Latin, nor Englysshe tonge, that euer I could se. What doth it auayle or profitte a man beynge of a debyle  weake na|ture to haue a Pomegranate or oni other thinge that co~forteth nature, restoreth stre~gth,Mark wel  bringeth agayne the perfeccion of health, yf he know|eth not y^ vse of it,  wherfort it ser|ueth. Uerelye euen so of prayer. If ther be neuer so many praiers prepa+red for men, yf they knowe not y^ vse of them, nor wherfore they serue, nor yet after what maner they shoulde be exercysed, what profytte receyue they of the~? It is but an easy thyng to pray, but to praye aright  accor+dynge to the wyll of God, is a thyng of gret difficulte  much labour. We thinke it an hard thing to speake vn+to a terrestiall Prynce with wordes conuenie~t, apte  decent,  is it but

a trifle to speake to the moost hyghe Prynce, in whose syght the moost e|loquent is very barbarous, and the moost holye, prophane? I haue ther|fore in this my treatyse followynge declared what praier is,The conte~+tes of this Boke. wherfore it serueth,  vnto what end we should vse it. I haue also declared of what vertue  strength the true  christe~ praier is,  howe we should prepare our selues to prayer, that we maye praye aright,  accordyng to Gods pleasure. And for asmuche as some men are of so scrupulous, I had al|moost sayd, supersticious conscie~ce, y^e they thynke no prayer to be herd, but that only whiche is prayed in y^ chirch, or some other sacred place, as they call it, I haue declared both by Scriptures  auncient Doctours, in what place it is lawfull to praye. Againe I haue declared after what maner men should praye, that God maye accepte theyr prayer, and for

what thynges they should pray, yea  at what tyme. And in asmuche as this word Prayer doth contayne in it not only Peticion, but also than+kes gyuyng for the benefyte that is receyued, therfore haue I also decla+red my mynde concernynge gyuing of thanckes to God the Father tho|row Iesus Christ.Colos. iii. All these thinges haue I done in this lytle worke ac|cordynge to the true vayne of y^e ho|ly scriptures  the iudgeme~t of the best learned Doctors, seking in this my laboure only the glory of God,  the profyte of his holy congregacio~. Which thynge yf it shall maye come to passe, I shall not only not repent me, but verye muche reioyce in the LORDE of this my trauayle,  shall hereby be encouraged after this, to take in hande other argumentes of no lesse vtilite  profyte.
Nowe gentle  prudente Ladye, disdayne not to take this lytle gift,

which your Basille doth with moste gentle herte offer vnto you as a te|stimonye of his obsequious wyll to|ward your good Ladiship. I doubt not but that as you your selfe shall fynde much pleasure  profyte by y^ readynge of it, so shall all the reders of the same obtayne so muche godly fruyte  christian knowledge by it, y^ they shall render herty  immortall thankes to God, that suche a worke co~meth forth dedicated to your La|dyshyppes name. I agayn on my be+halfe shall moost instantly desyre al|myghty God to assyst you at all ty|mes with his holy Spirite in y^e rea+dynge not only of this my lytle trea+tise, but also of al other workes that make to the glory of God  y^e helthe of your soule,  chefely in readyng y^ moost co~fortable Gospel of his dere|ly beloued sonne Iesus Christe oure LORDE  omnisufficient Sauyour (wherin the whole studye  pleasure

of a true Christian ought principal+ly to be) y^e you hauynge your whole meditacio in y^ lawe of y^ LORD both day  nyght,Psal. i. may fi~d such swetenes  pleasure i~ his moost delectable word that you wantynge at this present the company of a corporal husband, maye be maryed to the moost glory|ous  beatifull Kynge Iesus Christ Gods owne sonne in youre soule by fayth in this worlde,  after the de|parture from this vale of misery to lyue with him presentlye in the ful|nesse of perfecte ioye, worldes wyth|out ende. AMEN.
 The grace of our LORDE Iesus Christ be with your good La|dyshyppe, and with all your houshold. So be it.





The pathewaye vnto Prayer.

 What prayer is.

 The fyrste Chapter.
_PRayer after the co~mon diffinicion of the Doc|tors, The diffini+cion of pray+er. is a lyftinge vp of a pure mynde to God, wherein we aske some|what of hym.
This diffinicio~ of prayer semeth vnto me so godly  in euery parte a|greable to the holye scriptures that I thyncke it my bounden dutye to search out euery word of it in order,  to co~pare it wyth the moost sacred Scriptures,  the sayenges of y^ au~+cient Doctors.
Fyrste it teacheth vs that prayer is a lyftynge vppe of a pure mynde. Note fyrst of all that he sayeth, a lif|tynge

vp,Lyftynge vp, what at signify|ethe. What other thynge mea|neth this worde, lyftynge vp, than to shewe that who soeuer entendeth to praye, must vtterly seclude  put out of his herte all vayne cogitacio~   wordly thoughtes, all carnall fan|tasies, all vngodlye ymaginacions, to co~clude al such thynges as might make the herte of hym that prayeth to crepe vpon the grounde, to alie|nate  estraung his mynde from the meditacio~ of celestiall  deuyne mat+ters? And this is y^ very same thing that Christ teacheth in y^ Gospell of Mathewe,Math. vi. where he sayth: Whan y^ prayest, thou shalte not be lyke to y^ Hypocrites. For theyr manner is to stonde prayenge in y^e Synagoges  in the corners of the stretes, that me~ maye se the~, Certes I saye vnto you they haue theyr reward. But wha thou prayest enter into thy closet,  when y^ hast sparred thy dore, praye to thy father whiche is in sectee, 

thy father which seeth i~ secrete, shal eward the ope~ly. In theyse wordes Christ doth not only rebuke y^ false  ayned maner of prayenge, whiche the Hypocrites vse huntyng only af+ter vayne glory,  sekyng the prayse of men more then the glory of God  the health of theyr owne soules, but he also declarethe howe we shall pre|pare our selues for to pray, that we maye be hearde. He co~maundeth vs to enter into oure closet,  to sparre our dore. What other thynge mea|neth Christe by this, but that, as I haue sayde before, we should expulse all te~porall thynges out of our har|tes, whansoeuer we entend to pray,  haue our myndes altogyther set v|pon celestiall  heauenly thynges?Mark wel  followe. Therfore ought so many as entend to praye with fruyte to seke an occa+sion to be seguestred from all tempo+rall affaires  from the troubles of wordely thynges, whiche myght be

an impediment to them in theyr ho+ly meditacions,  so to be free from all externall  mundane thynges, y^ theyr prayer in dede maye be a very lyftynge vp, according to the begyn+nynge of our diffinicion.


 The second Chapter.
ANd that this thynge maye the more conueniently be brought to passe, it shalbe expedient for such as intende to exercyse prayer to re|pose them selues and to sette theyr hertes quiette from all the trou|bles of the worlde, yea  to subduce  conuaye the~ selues from the co~pa|ny of the worldely people into some secrete  solitarye place for the tyme of theyr prayer, that they maye the more frely gyue theyr myndes to de+uout  holy meditacion, as the ma|ner of many holy men was in times paste. Examples haue we of dyuers in the holye Scripture, whiche vsed this trade. The gospel sheweth how

Christ was won many tymes whe~ e would praye to go into the feldes nd ther beyng alone vpon a moun|ayne vtterly secluded fro~ all other ompany,Luke. vi. to perseuer  continue in he prayer of God al y^ whole night. Agayne a lytle before his passion we ead that he entendynge to pray vn+to his celestiall father forsoke the co~|any of other,Mat. xx. yea and although he oke with him only thre of his disci|ples at that instant. Peter, Iohn,  Iames, yet notwithstandynge wha~ e was in the mou~t of Oliuete, y^ ac+customed place of hys prayenge, he ent awaye from the~ also aboute a ones cast,  he kneling downe, prai+d so hertely  so longe to God his fa+ther, that for very anguysh, payne  orow the sweat of his moost blessed ody was eue~ as y^ droppes of bloud unnynge downe vpon the earthe.Act. x. Peter also beyng in the house of Si+mon the Tanner went vp into y^ vp+per

parte of the house to praye, tha he myght not be troubled w^t y^ othe co~pany.ii. Re. iiii. Helyseus also, wha~ he shul pray to God for a certayne chylde was deade, went alone into the cha~+ber, where the chylde laye,  sperre the dore  so prayed.ob. . Agayne Sar the doughter of Raguell, desyryng to be delyuered from the~ improper  imbraydyng, as it would appere, of a certayne default, wherwith on of her fathers ha~dmaydens dyd im|brayd  caste her in the teth, forsoke all co~pany,  went streyght into an vpper cha~ber of her house,  ther be|yng alone, dyd nether eate nor dri~ke by y^ space of thre dayes  thre nigh|tes, but continued in prayer,  bese|ched God euen w^t teares y^e he would delyuer her from this imbraydyng  rebuke.Iu. x. xii. Iudith i~ lyke maner, wha~ she should put herselfe in ioperdy for the helth of her people, went fyrst in to her Oratory  secrete place, wher

he was wonte to praye,  so desyred the helpe of God. At certayne other tymes also before she slewe Holofer|us she went forth i~ the night time for to praye quietly by herselfe. Quene Hester also puttinge of her Pryncelike garmentes,Hest. xiiii. prayed for her people to God secretely i~ her cha~+ber. Agayne Daniel,Dau. vi. when certayne Dukes  Earles for the hatred and euell wyll that they bare vnto him, had caused kynge Darius to make an Acte that who soeuer asketh any Peticion of theyr God, yea or of ony man but of the Kynge alone for the space of thy tye dayes, he shoulde be cast into the denne of Lyons, ceased not to praye for al y^e Acte of y^ kyng, but styll as he was wont to do, prai+ed boldely to his LORDE God, beyng in his cha~ber secretely by himselfe a|lone. Thus se we that both Christ  other holye men also, sought euer|more an occasion to be quiet  solli|tary,

that they myght the more +ly talke with God in theyr prayer,  so came it to passe that theyr prayer was vnfaynedly a lyftynge vp.


 The thyrde Chapter.
Psal. xxi.IT is not without a cause y^ Pray+er in the holy scripture is compa|red to a sweate perfume, whose na|ture is alwaye, yf it be once ince~sed or set on fyre,Prayde co~+pared to a perfume. to lyft vp it selfe  styl to go vpward so lo~g as it lasteth I lyke maner the true  christen pray+er ought to lyfte vp it selfe with de|uynd co~templacion,  styll to go vp so longe as it lasteth with the medi|acion of celestiall thinges,  not to repe vpon the grounde with am thoughtes  wordely ymaginacio~s. For so is that prayer no lyftyng vp of mynde or of him that prayeth, vn+to heauen, but rather a thrustynge  to hell, yea  worketh snne  damnacion to hym that prayeth as the salmograph sayeth: Oratio

 fiat in peccatum. f you be rysen a|gayne with Christ sayth S. Paule seke for those thynges y^e are aboue,Colos. iii. where Christ is sittyng on the right hand of God. Set your myndes vp+pon the thynges aboue  not vpo~ y^e thynges of the earthe. For you are dead,  your lyfe is hyd with Christ in God. Wha~ so euer Christ our lyfe shall appeare, then shall we also ap|peare with hym in glorye. So that not onlye prayer but also the whole lyfe of a Christen man ought to be a lyftyng vp, that is to saye, a ferue~t desyre  diligent sekyng of supernal  heauenly thynges. But let vs pro+cede with our diffinicion. Hytherto haue we heard that Prayer is a lyf+tyng vppe. Wherof I praye you? of ha~des or eyes? Nay verely, but of a pure mynde. For as touchynge the yftyng vp of handes  eies, it maye lso be vsed so wel of Hypocrites as f true Christians. Therfore sayeth

Chrisostome,De oratio~e thouhg thou doest not bow thy knees, nor knocke thy brest, nor strecthe oute thy handes vnto heauen, yet yf thou onlye shewe forth a feruee mynde, thou shalte make a perfecte prayer.Note of ex+ternall gestures in Prayer. Not w^tstan|dyng yf such thinges be done i~ time of prayer procedyng from y^ feruent  inward affeccion of y^e spirite, they are not to be discu~mended.Psa. xxii. For Da|uid sayth, I haue lyfted vp myne ei+es vnto the, which dwellest in heaue~ And S. Paule sayth,. Tim. ii. I wyll y^ men pray in euery place, liftyng vp your handes w^toute wrath  contencion. We read also y^ Christe vsed to knele when he prayed.Luke. xxii. And the hu~ble and poore Publicane knocked his breste when he prayed,Luke. xviii sayenge: O God be thou merciful to me a synner. Ther+fore as touchyng y^e external gesture  outward behauour, as y^e lyftynge vp of ha~des or eyes, the knelyng o knockynge on the brest, in as muche

as they are meane  indiffere~t thyn+ges, they are to be lefte to the iudge+ment of deuout  well disposed peo|ple, eyther to be done or to be left vn+done, as their mindes shal serue the~. And for as muche as they pertayne nothynge to our matter, I wyll le the~ passe  go forth w^t our diffinicio~.


 The fourth Chapter.
PRayer, say the holy Doctors, is a lyftynge vp of a pure mynde. Theise wordes are not to be gone o|uer wyth a lyghte foote, as they vse to saye, but depely to be weyed,  se|riously to be pondered. For in them doth co~sist in a maner the whole effi|cacy, vertue, strength, power  pith of prayer.Prayer is  wor of the mynd. Fyrst we shall note y^e pray+er is not the worke of y^ mouth, but of the mynde, yea  that not of a cor+rupte, flesshely, malicious  synfull, but of a pure, immaculate, clene, vn+spotted, faithful  charitable mynd. But I wyll fyrst shewe by the scrip+tures  holy fathers, y^t prayer is the

worke of the mynde accordynge to our diffinicion,  afterwarde some|what declare of y^ purite of y^ mynd.
That prayer is the worke of the mynde, it is manifest by dyuers pla|ces of holy scripture.Exo. xiiii. For whan o+ses at the commaundement of God led y^ people of Israel out of Egipte,  Pharao with his cruell army fol|lowed, purposynge vnmercifully to slaye the~, he beyng in great thought  care howe he myght safely co~du the Israelites,  yet styll trustynge  hauyng his whole affiaunce repo|sed in theyr LORDE God, prayed no|thyng at all with his mouth, but on+ly vttered his cause secretlye in his herte vnto God,  he was hearde. For the LORDE God sayd vnto him What cryest y^u vnto me His cryeng was not the voice of the mouth, but the affeccion of the herte. He cryed w^t a pure mynde to God,  therfore was he hearde, though the mouthe

kepte sylence.. Reg. i. In lyke maner Anne the wyfe of Helcana, when she had ben long baren  w^tout fruyte, pray+ed God, that he woulde take awaye from her opprobry and shame, and gyue her chyldre~, wich thynge she ob+tayned. And yet sayth the scripture she spake in her herte. Her lippes on+ly moued,Luke. vii. but her voyce was hearde nothynge at all. Mary Magdalene also prayed, not wyth her lyppes  mouthe, when she wasshed Christes fete w^t y^ teares of her eyes,  wyped them with the heere of her head, kys|synge  annoynted the~ full tenderly in the house of Symon the Phary|se, she only lame~ted in her herte her synfull lyuynge  dissolute co~uersa+cion, desyryng in her mynde to haue remission of her synnes,  she hearde this swete voyce of Christ. Her syn|nes are forgyne~ her, bicause she hath loued much. ea  immediatly after Christ sayde to her. Thy fayth hath

saued the,Ioan. iiii. go thy way i~ peace. Christe~ also the selfe trueth  wisdom of his father sayd to the woman of Sama+ria, whan they talked togyther of worshyppyng God. Woman, beleue me, the hour co~meth, whan neyther in this mountayne, nor yet at Ieru+salem, ye shall worship the father. e worshyp that ye knowe not, we wor|shyp that we knowe. For helth is of the Iewes. But the houre co~meth  nowe it is, whan the true worshyp|pers shall worshyp the father in spi|rite  trueth. For the father sekethe such y^t shoulde worshyp hym. God is a spirite,  they that worshyp hym, must worshyp hi~ in spiryte  trueth. Here christ,Ioan. xiiii Titus. i. which is y^ very trueth  can not lye, sheweth vs two notable thynges. One that God his father is a spirite, another, that as he is a spiryte, so wyll he be worshypped in the spirite,Note. who perceyueth not tha~ that it is the Spirite, the herte, the

mynde, I meane the inwarde  spiri+tuall man, that must worshyp God It is a common sayeng among vs, lyke wyll to lyke. And euery one de|syreth suche as he is hi~selfe. Trueth it is. Now is God a spirite, therfore requireth he a spirituall manner of worshyppynge, which doubtles pro|cedeth from the herte,  not from y^ ste~toreous voyce of the mouth. The pure affeccion of the herte,  not the whysperynge noyse of y^ lyppes doth God requyre. God which is the sear+cher of the herte, seaketh to be wor|shypped in the herte, as he sayth by Salomo~,Pro. xxiii. sonne gyue me thy herte. Moreouer S. Paule sayth,Rom. i. God is my witnes, whom I worshyp in my spirite. In my spirite, sayth he, and not in the vnfruytefull bablyng of my lyppes.Ephe. v. Agayne, Speake amo~g yourselues in Psalmes, Hymnes,  spirituall songes, syngyng and ma|kynge melody in youre hertes to the

LORDE. Lostyll he maketh mencion of the herte, wyllynge y^ all prayses, songes  melody be done in our her|tes to y^e LORD our God. As though he shoulde saye, all that euer is done w^tout the herte, is vayne, vnfruyte+full, yea  playne abhominacion be|fore God, rather workynge da~nacio~ then saluacion to the doers of it, as Christ sayeth:Mat. xv. This people honoure me w^t theyr lyppes, but theyr herte is farre from me. Uerely they wor|shyp me in vayne. Thus se we pro|ued by the scripture, that Prayer is the worke of the herte, of the spiryte of the mynde,  not of mouth  lyp|pes. But let vs heare what the Doc+tors saye to this matter.


 The fyfte Chapter.
In oratio~ Dom. Ad transis+mund. Lib. it.SAynt Cipriane y^ blessed martyre sayth, which Fulgentius also re|cyteth, that God is not the hearer of the voyce, but of the herte, neyther is he to be admonysshed w^t exclama|cions

 outecryes, whiche seeth the thoughtes, as the LORDE proueth  sayth, what do ye thinke wyckednes in youre hartes  in another place, All congregacions shall know, that I am the searcher of the raynes and harte, that is to saye, of the inward parte.Libro de Cain et A+bel. cap. ix. Also S. Ambrose sayeth, take hede that thou doste not babble out rasshely the mysteries of the Crede, or of the LORDES prayer. Doste thou not knowe, howe greuous a thynge it is to heape vppe synne in Prayer, where thou trusteste to haue reme|dy Certes y^ LORDE taught by the Prophet y^e this is a greuous cursse,Psa. viii. sayeng: His praier is beco~e eue~ very synne. Excepte peraduenture thou recou~test it but a tryfle to mistrust. It is surely a great incredulite and vnfaythfulnes to thynke thus of y^ power of God, y^ thou canste not be heard,Mark this wel. excepte thou cryest oute. Let thy worke crye, let thy fayth cry, let

thy mynde crye, let thy passions and suffrynges cry, let thy bloud, as the bloud of holy Abell, cry, wherof god sayde to Caym,Gen. iiii. the voyce of thy bro+thers bloud cry vnto me. For he hea+reth in secrete, which maketh cleane in secrete. We can not heare a ma~ ex+cepte he speaketh vnto vs, but vnto God, not wordes but thoughtes do speake.Moral. lib xxii. cap. xviii. Agayne, S. Gregory sayth, vndoubtedly true prayer consysteth not in the voyce of the mouthe, but in the thoughtes of the herte. For our wordes do not make the voyces the more pythethy and valeaunt to come vnto the moost secrete eares of God, but our desyre and affeccions. Therfore sayth the LORDE in y^ Gos|pell: Enter into thy closet  sparreMat. vi. thy dore.Note. He sparreth y^ dore,  pray|eth in his closet, whiche holdeth his peace w^t his mouth,  powreth oute the affeccio~ of his mynde in y^ syghte of God aboue.Lib. de mag. i. Moreouer S. Auste~

ayeth: Thou knowest, I am sure, y^ t is commaunded vs for none other thynge that we should praye in our closettes being sparred (wherby the secrete partes of the mynde are sig|nifyed) but that God seaketh not to be monyshed or taught by oure spea|kynge of that thynge, whiche we co|uyt that he shoulde gyue vs. For he that speaketh gyueth outwardely a sygne or token of his wyl by some ar+ticulate, playne  euidente sounde. But God is both to be soughte  to be prayed vnto, euen in the very se|crete partes of a reasonable soule, whiche is called the inward ma~. For he wylleth that these be his Te~ples. Wherfore we nede no speakyng whe~ e praye, that is to saye, no wordes that shall make any sounde, excepte peraduenture as y^ prestes do, for to vtter theyr mynde, not y^ God, but that man shoulde heare the~,  wyth a certayne consent be drawen to co~|te~placion

by reme~brynge the~. Here to agreeth the saye~g of S. JeromeIn Epist. d Ephe. we ought, sayth he, to syng, to make melody,  to prayse y^e LORDE rather in mynde then in voyce. And this is it that is sayd, syngynge  makyng melody to the LORDE  your hertes.Ephe. v. A good lesson for our musi+ions and haunters Let yong men heare these thyrges, yea let them heare, whose offyce it is to syng in y^ Chyrch, that they must singe to God not in the voyce but in the herte, neither must theyr throte  chawes be annoynted after y^ ma|ner of Gameplayers w^t swete oynte+mentes, that in the chyrch syngyng more fytte for game places shoulde be hearde, but in feare, in worke, in knowledge of the scriptures ought they to synge vnto the ORDE.d Roma. Lib. vir. cap. v. Dri|gen also sayeth, God in prayer doth not so much weye  ponder our wor|des, as he doth the herte  y^e mynde For he it is, whyche searchethe th hertes and the raynes.
Although I coulde reherse many no notable saye~ges of these  other Doctors,Psal. vii. Sap. i. Apo. ii. Jere. xvii. which proue manifestly y^e rayer is not the worke of y^e mouth ut of the herte, not of y^e voyce, but f y^e thought, not of y^e lyppes but of he mynde, yet these at this present aye seme aboundantly to satisfye. eyther do I recyte y^e testymonies f y^e old fathers to confyrine  make ur matter the more stronge, which redy is sufficiently establysshed by he holy Scriptures, neyther nede hey the confyrmacion of any man|es doctryne, whiche of them selues ught to be beleued without hesita+on or doubtynge of the faythefull,  asmuch as they be y^ Oracles  in llible spech of God, in whome al ecessary trueth for our saluacio~ is prehended,The cause of her|synge the Doctors  this oke  without the authori+ wherof all that euer is taught or ritten, be but mere fantasies  h+ayne inuencions: but I haue cal|led

the holy  catholyke Doctors t witnes, bicause they reach the sam thynge y^t the Scripture dothe,  t stop the mouthes of certayne wyc|ked  ignora~t persons, which thick no trueth to be trueth except by m|nes authoritie it be establyshed, an that men seyng  hearyng the iudg|ment of such as are learned, should be the more redy to cast away they Hypocrisye  acco~modate the~ selues to the true maner of worshyppyng and prayeng to our LORDE God.


 The syxte Chapter.
VUell of these thynges tha~ here+tofore rehearsed is it easye to lerne that such as wyll pray to God with fruyte, must praye in herte, in spirite, in mynde, in thought, in af|feccion, in the soule, in the inward man, or els the noyse of the mouth,  mu~blynge of the lippes, the roryng of the throte, the shakynge of y^e head the knockynge on the brest, the kne|lynge

on the ground,  what soeuer canne be rekened more is vayne, vn fruytful,  nothyng to y^ purpose, ra+ther bryngynge damnacion then sal+uacio~, as we haue heard heretofore.
What is than to be thoughte of such personnes, which wha~ they are in the te~ple or els where, neuer leue ablynge, theyr myndes beynge vt|terly drawen from theyr prayers,  altogyther set vpon transitory and wordely thynges Some streatche ut theyr prayers into an innume|rable no~ber of leaues, thynkynge so to do God an hygh sacrifyce.Agaynste y^ vayne beblers  super+sticious worshyp+pers of saynctes Some also vpon theyr bedes taly vp, I ca~+not tel howe many Lady Psalters, heynge perswaded y^e by that menes they shall se our Lady corporally be+fore they dye,  that whan they are once dead, our lady  all the. xi. M virgins w^t other saintes mo, whose nomber is infinyte, shall mete wyth the~, euery one hauyng in theyr han+des

a brennynge taper of wae,  so receyue the~ ito glory, puttynge vpo~ theyr heades a crowne of golde gar|nysshed, I can not tell you, w^t howe many red Roses. Some agayn wor+shyp dayely a great nomber of sayn|tes euery one hauige to theyr parte an hundred Pater nosters, wyth as many Aues, besydes y^e Credes, and that for diuers causes. These thyn|ges be more openly knowen than y^e they nede here to be rehersed, except we be so blynde that we wyll se no|thynge,  so ignorant that we wyll nothyng knowe. I feare greatly vn+lesse that may iustly be spoke~ of such vayne bablers, whiche is spoken by the Prophet Esay,Esa. xxix.  rehersed of our sauiour Iesus Christ in the Gospel of Mathewe:Math. xv. This people, sayth he, honoreth me with theyr lyppes, but theyr herte is far from me. Uerelye they worshyppe me in vayne. Yea I feare vnlesse that they thorow such

vnfaythfull bablyng do acumulate  heape vp to them selues the grea|ter daacion, as Christ wytnesseth in the Gospell.Mat. xxiii. Wo be to you Scri|bes  Pharises Hypocrites, sayethe Christ, which eate the houses of wy|dowes, yea and y^e vnder the pretext of longe Prayer.Luke. xx. For this shal ye be punyshed y^e more greuously. Agayn he sayeth: Beware of the Scribes, whiche haue a pleasure to walke in longe roobes,  loue to be saluted in the Markettes,  to haue the chefe preminence in the Synagoges, and the hygh seates at feastes, which de|uour y^e houses of wydomes fayning outewardely longe Prayers. They shall receyue the greater damnacio~.Mat. xii. If we shall at the daye of iudgeme~t render an accountes of euerye ydle worde y^t we speake, as the holy scrip|ture testifyeth, what is then to be thought of those wordes, whiche we vnfruitfully waste, whe~ we pretend

outwardly to pray,  yet inwardly haue our myndes enta~gled w^t y^e care of worldly thi~ges, or els entysed fro~ the affeccio~ of prayer with vayne co+gitacions of thynges carnall. It is to be feared vnlesse we i~curre  run into greater damnacion, then they which praye nothynge at all. For is suche prayer any other thynge than playne mockynge of God Our ex|ternal pretext is as though we prai+ed and desyred to haue our prayers heard of God, but i~ dede our maner of prayeng is nothyng els I speke of the vnfruytfull bablers, but only a desyrynge of God that he shoulde heare vs  our prayers nothyng at al, seyng we our selues do not heare them, nor yet mynde them in oure hertes, yea we desyre hi~ that he wyl take vengeaunce on vs for our moc+kyng  ydle bablyng. And this is it that S. Ambrose sayth,Lib. de Cain et Abell. cap. ix. take hede y^ thou doste not bable oute rashly the

misteries of the Crede  of the LOR|DES prayer. Doste thou not knowe howe greuous a thyng it is in pray+er for to heap vp synne, where thou trustest to haue remedye Certes y^ LORD taught by y^e Prophet,Psal. cviii. that it is a greuous cursse, saye~g: His pray+er is become to hym euen very syn. . Gregory also saith. Simulata sanctitas est duplex iniquitas. Fayned holynes is double iniquite. To praye nothyng at al is iniquite  playne synne,Note. but to pretende outwardly an holy ma|ner of prayenge,  yet not praye in dede in our hertes, is double iniqui+te,  encreaseth much da~nacio~ vnto vs, as we haue hearde heretofore, in asmuch as we are dissemblers both before God  ma~. But let vs heare what S. John Chrisostome sayeth:Homel. xii. Demul. canan. Many co~mynge into the chyrch do extende  streytch out theyr prayer vnto a thousand verses, as though the multitude of wordes were nede|ful

vnto God as vnto one that doth not knowe what y^ arest, which kno+weth the matter, before thou thyn|kest. For they the~ selues also do not knowe what they saye. Theyr lyp|pes are moued only, but theyr mide is without fruyte,  therfore are y^ eares of God deafe. Thou heareste not thine owne prayer,  wylt thou that y^ LORDE should heare thy pray+er? I haue bowed, y^u sayst, my knees. Thou hast bowed in dede thy knees wythin, but thy mynde wa~dreth a|broad. Thy body is within, but thy thought is without. Thy mouth in dede spake, but thy mynd dyd thike vpon vsuries. It dyd count the re|uenewes of thy possessions. It dyd behold the descripcions  valowyn|ges of houses. It reme~bred the wor+des of thy frendes. It loked vpon y^ negligenses of thy seruauntes. It laughed at the pleasaunt iestyng of the Pharasites. It consydered the

beauty of women. Therfore know that these thinges are done. Follow thou beynge a man the woma~ of Ca+nane, which very diligently and w^t hygh wisdome prayed vnto y^c LORD  therfore deserued to obtayne her requestes. But thou wylte saye per+adue~ture, I haue no doughter, whi+che is replete with the dyuell, but y^u hast a soule, whiche is stuffed full of synne.Homil. lxxix. De orati|one. Agayne he sayth, If whan y^e bodye lyghtethe prostrate vpon the grounde,  the mouth bableth vayn+ly, the mynde goeth about the house and market, how maye such one say that he hath prayed in the syghte of God. For he prayeth in the syght of GOD, which gathereth altogyther his mynde quietly,  hath nothyng to do w^t the worlde,  lyfteth vp him+selfe euen vnto heauen, and putteth out of his mynd al humayn though+tes. For he y^t prayeth, must so praye, that he settethe his mynde at quiet

from worldly thynges,  calleth on God with a sorowfull and contryte herte. Neyther maye he vse many wordes, nor draw out his prayer on a great length, but speake fewe wor+des, yea  those symple, playne and homely. For not in the multitude of wordes, but in y^e quycknes of mynd doth the whole matter consyst, that we should be heard.Ibidem. Once agayne he saith: In prayer ther is not so much nede of the voyce as of the thought, nor of the stretchyng out of y^e ha~des as of the intencion of the mynde.
Thus se we also proued by y^e Do+ctors, that it is the mynde, wher w^t a Christen man must pray. The mu~|blinge ouer multitude of prayers, y^ cryenge out of the voyce, y^e yellynge of the throte, the lyftynge vp of the handes, the knockynge of the brest, the shakyng of the head, the knelyng on the knees,  whatsoeuer can be in ue~ted or rehersed besydes these thin+ges,

are i vayne, yf the mynd be not present in the tyme of prayer. I wyl pray in spiryte, sayth Paule,i. Cor. xiiii. and I wyll praye also in mynde. I wyll synge in Spirite, and I wyll synge also in mynde. Therfore y^e it maye be prayed aryght, let euery ma~ say, farewel to al humayne affayres and worldely matters, and so quietly re+pose himselfe, while he prayeth, that accordyng to our diffinicio~, his pray+er in very dede may be a lystynge vp of the mynde.


 The seuenth Chapter.
BUt some man wyll saye perad|ue~ture, is it ynough, yf I pray with my mynde, the herte eynge se+moted from mundane affayres and worldly businesses? I au~swere: Our diffinicion teacheth vs not onlye to pray with the mynde, but also with a pure mynde. For Prayer is y^ lyf|tyng vp of a pure mynd.Pray  a pure myn So fewe y^t it is not ynough to pray w^e y^e mynd,

excepte it be pure. It wyll be obiec|ted, than shall we neuer praye. For who can say, my herte is cleane and I am pure from synne?Pro. xx. i. Ioan. i. I aun|swere: If ye saye, we haue no synne, we deceyue our selues,  the trueth is not in vs. But yf we confesse our synnes, God is faythfull  ryghte|ous to forgyue vs oure synnes, and make vs cleane from all vnryghte|ousnes. The scripture sayth,Psal. xxxi. Rom. iiii. blessed are they whose iniquities are forgy|uen,  whose sinnes are couered, bles+sed is that man to whom the LORDE hathiputed no synne. It sayth not Blessed are they, which haue no ini|quities, or which haue no sinne. For S. James sayethe:Iaco. iii. In many thyn|ges we synne al. So long as we are in this mortall flesshe we can neuer be pure  cleane from the dregges of synne, yf from the synne it selfe. We can neuer in this lyfe aspyre vnto so great perfeccion of innocency, that

we maye appeare pure  gyltelesse in the syghte of God,Iob. xxv. in whose eies y^e very sterres  Au~gels be not clene. Howe than maye we praye wythe  pure mynde?Learne here howe we may praye wyth a faythfull mynde. Uerely yf oure mynde be faythfull to God,  charitable to our neyghbour, God doth dissemble all our faultes,  in as muche as we are faythfull vnto hym,  louyng to oure christen brothers, he counteth vs all pure,i. Ioan. iii. as S. Iohn sayth: He y^ is borne of God, sinneth not, that is to saye, he that beleueth in God,Mark wel. his synne is not imputed vnto hym, in asmuch as he consenteth not to the synne, but hongreth and thyrstethe after the perfeccion of true innocen+cy. Our hertes be purifyed by fayth sayeth the scripture,Act. xv. so that who so euer prayeth with a faythfull  cha+ritable mynde, he is counted before God to praye with a pure mynde.God and the worlde iugeth not alphe. The world. For God iudgeth not as the worlde dothe. The worlde thynketh hym to

be a good deuoute man that goethe vp  downe wyth a coggyrnge payre of Bedes in his handes, or knelethe downe in his stole sole~ly with a great Matters boke in his hand, making such a noyse with his lyppes  to~ge, that all the whole chyrch ryngethe of it, although his harte be farre fro~ God,  his mynde occupied aboute worldely businesses.God. But God behol+deth the mynde, the herte, y^e inwarde man,  loketh whither he prayeth in purite  cleanes or not. If the herte be stuffed with fayth  charite, then is God well pleased,  accepteth the prayer for an hygh  pleasaunt Sa+cryfyce. Who beynge in the temple hearynge the proude Pharise,Luk. xviii.  the poore Publicane prayeng togyther would not haue estemed the Phari|se to be more ryghteous  pure in y^ syght of God, then y^e wretched Pub+licane For the Pharise confessed no syn, but vertues many. He gaue god

thankes y^e he was not lyke other me~, whiche are extorcioners, vnryghte|ous, adulterers,  as the Publicane was. He fasted twyse in the weke,  gaue the tentes of all thynges that he possessed. Dangelyke righteous|nes and seraphical perfeccion. Who woulde not haue thought this holy religious father worthy to be cano|nysed  related into the nomber of Sayntes et sayth Christ playnly that the poore Publycane, whyche broughte forthe no good dedes, but stode a farre of  durste not lyfte vp his eies to heauen, but humbly knoc+ked his brest, saye~ge: O God be thou mercyfull vnto me a synner, wente home more ryghteous i Gods syght then the Pharise. Whye so? For the Pharise had no true Fayth in hym but an arrogant presumpcion, bo|stynge  crayng of his good dedes, as though God were in his det, and he not in Gods. And that he had no

christen charite in him, it is euident seyng y^t he despysed his neighboure. For Charite, x. i. Det. iiii. sayth the Scripture, couereth the multytude of synnes.
That the Publica~s prayer came from a pure mynde, that is, from a mynde faythfull  charytable, it is manifest. Fyrste bycause that with an humble herte he came to God for remission of his synnes, beleuyng to obtayne it. Secondely, seynge that he accused no ma~ but himselfe only. Therfore went he home more iusti|fyed, sayeth the holye Scripture. Therfore to all suche as outwardly pretende holynes,Mat. xxi.  yet are vnpure in theyr mynde, Christe sayeth. The Harlottes  Publicans shall go be|fore you into the kyngdo~ of heauen. Agayne,uk. xvi. ye are they y^ iustify youre selues before me~, but God knoweth your hertes. For y^t whiche is prayse worthy before men, is playne abho|minacion before God.
Abell also  Caym offred both sa|crifices to god,Gen. iiii.  the scripture sayth that God loked vnto Abell  vnto his gyftes, but vnto Caym and vn|to his giftes he loked not. God iud|geth not y^ personne of the acte but the arte of the personne. It is here to be noted, that God not after the fasshyon of the world iudgeth y^e per|son of the acte, but the acte of y^e per|son. He fyrste loketh to the person,  afterward vnto the acte, as the holy scripture sayeth here. He loked vnto Abell,  vnto his gyftes. Fyrst vnto Abell,  afterward vnto Abels gyf|tes. If the person be good, that is, faythful  charitable, tha~ doth God accepte the gyfte, not for the digni|te of the gifte it selfe, but for y^e faith of him that offereth.Psal. xv. Psal. xxiii. For as y^e Psal|mograph sayeth, God hath no nede of oure goodes. The earth is y^ LOR|DES,  all y^t euer is contayned in it.
As concernynge that the Scrip|ture sayth, God loked vnto Abell, it signifieth that God fauoured Abel,

i asmuch as his hart was both aith+ful  charitable. And y^t God loked to y^e gyftes of Abell, it she wethe y^e God was well pleased w^t the~, seyng they proceded fro~ the herte of such one as was enfarsed with fayth  charite.
As touchynge that the scripture sayeth, God loked not vnto Caym  vnto his gyftes, it sygnifyethe that God neyther fauoured Caym, nor yet accepted his gyftes, seynge that Caym had in him neyther fayth nor Charitie. For his herte was stuffed full of yre  wrath towarde his bro|ther Abell, in so much that shortely after it came to passe accordynge to his pretensed malyce, that he slewe his brother. And wherfore dydde he slaye hym1. Ioan. iii. verely bycause his owne workes were euell, and his brothers ryghteous. Thus sewe, that be our gyftes neuer so precious in y^e syght of men,Ec. xxxiiii. yet yf the gyuer be wicked, that is, vnfaythefull and vnchary|table,

God vtterlye conte~neth  set|teth the~ at noughte, as the wyse ma~ sayeth: The gyftes of the wycked, y^ moost hygh doth not alowe and ap|proue. S. Iuste~ also sayth,Det. ccxxvi. De te~pore. the pray+er of an enuious man is wont to be put a backe from the eares of God. Hereto agreeth the sayenge of Chri|sostome: Let vs, Dom xxvii. in Gen. cap. viii. sayethhe, in euery place brynge forth a pure mynde. For that is the cause of al good thin+ges. The good LORDE is not wonte to attende  gyue hede to those thin+ge that are done of vs, but vnto the inwarde mynde, wherof we are mo|ued to do these thynges. And good lokynge to this mynde, doth eyther approue or turne awaye those thyn+ges that we do. Therfore whythe we praye, or faste, or gyue almes (for those are our spiritual Sacrifyces) or whyther we do ony other certayn spiritual worke, let vs do that, beig moued therunto with a good mynd

Therfore sayth Christe,Mat. v. when thou offrest a gyfte at the Aultare,  the doste reme~er that thy brother hath any thynge agaynste the, leaue thy gyfte there before the Aultare,  ga thy waye, be fyrste reconcyled to thy brother,  tha~ come  offer thy gyft. In lyke maner when we praye, we maye not onely prouyde y^e we maye pray w^t the mynd, al humayne thin ges  worldly affayres semoted and layde a syde, but also we must gyue earneste diligence, that we praye w^t a pure mynde, that is, with a mynd stuffed ful of fayth  charite. For as Dauyd sayeth:Psal. ixv. I perceyue ony vn|righteousnes, y^e is to saye, vnfayth|fulnesse, in my herte, God wyll not heare me.Psa. cxliiii Agayne: The LORD is ny to all that call vpon hym, yea to all that call vpon hym in trueth. And the wyse man sayth:Sap. i. Into a ma lycious soule wisdome wyll not en|ter, nor into a bodye subiecte vnto

synne.1. Tim. ii. S. Paule also sayth, I wyl y^e men praye in euery place, lyftynge vp pure ha~des without wrath and contencion. So that he whiche bea+reth a herte faythful towarde God, and charite towarde his neyghbour is fytte to praye in y^e syghte of God. Therfore let vs laboure seryously, y^e whan we i~tende to pray, we maye ex+clude  put out of our hertes all infi+delite wrathe  co~te~cio~,  be so ple~te|ously enfarsed with Fayth  Chari|te, that our prayer maye iustly seme to be a very lyftynge vppe of a pure mynde. And that this maye be done the more conueniently, it shall be ne+cessary for vs to praye with Dauid.Psal. 1. Create in me O God a pure  clene herte,  a right vp spirite make thou a newe in my inwarde partes. But et vs heare more of our diffinicion. It followeth.


 The eyght Chapter.
VNto God. Note that he sayth, vnto God, not vnto Iupiter, Apollo, Mercurius, Bacchus, Iu|no, Minerua, Pallas Uenus  such other Gods  Godesses, yea rather dyuels,Ps. lxxxx. as the Psalmograph sayth, the Gods of the Neythen are dyuel|les, vnto whom the Ethuyckes and Gentyles dyd fly in theyr prayer for succoure, nor vnto Baal, Astaroth, Moloch, the Quene of heauen, and such other Idolles, as the olde Ido|laters the Iewes, worshypped  cry+ed vnto for helpe, no nor yet as oure new Idolaters were wont to do,Agaynste y^ superstici|ous Inuo+cacion of Say^nctes as vnto Luke for y^e Oxe, vnto Iob for the poxe, vnto Anthony for the pyg, vnto Loye for the horse, vnto Apo|line for the to thake, vnto Rooke for the pestilence, vnto Syth for thyn|ges loste, vnto Gertrude for the ra|tonnes  myse, vnto Blase for the Ague, vnto Agues for the fyre, vnto Barbara for the the thonder, vnto

Christopher for continuall helth, vn+to Annes for a husband, vnto Mar+garete for women with chylde, vnto Kateryne for learnyng, vnto Cris|pyne  Crispiniane for shoes makig vnto Cosme and Damiane for Phi|sicke, vnto Cleme~t for bruing beere, and such other i~numerable, but vn|to God. For Prayer is a lyftyng vp of a pure mynde vnto God. Unto God ought we to lyfte vp oure har|tes, when we pray,Psa. cxxii. as y^e Psal. sayth, vnto y^e haue I lyfted vp myne eyes, which dwellest i~ heue~ Agein, I haue lyfted vp myne eyes into the Moun+taynes, fro~ whence helpe may co~e vn+to me.Psal. cxx. My helpe cometh fro~ y^e LORD which made heauen  earth. Also in another place,Psal. cxix. when I was in trou|ble, I cryed vnto the LORDE,  he fa|uourably heard me.Psa. xxxiii. 1. Pet. iii. Psa. xxiiii. The eyes of the LORDE are vpo~ the ryghteous, and his eares are bent vnto theyr pray|ers. Myne eyes, sayeth Dauid, are

cryed Adam, Abell, Seth, Enos, E|noch, Nohe, Thare, Abraha~, Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph, Moses, Aaharon, Ie+tro, Eleazar, Phinees, Iosue, Caleb Othoniel, Gedeon, Helcana, Samu+ell, Nathan, Dauid, Salomon, He|lias, Micheas, Elizeus, Ezechias, Esaias, Iosias, Iob, Mathatias, Thoby, w^t all the other auncient fa|thers  holye Prophetes of the olde Testament, but vnto GOD alone. Agayne vnto whom prayed Ioseph Iohn~ Baptiste, Lazarus, Nicode|mus, Gamaliel, Cornelius, Apollo, Dionisius, Aquilia, Steuen, Phi|lip, Agabus, Ananias, Timothe, Ti+tus, Ioses, Philemon, and all the Apostles, with many other, whiche are contayned in y^e volumes of both Testamentes, but vnto God alone? The prayed, and were heard. Shall oure Prayers than be vayne,Esa. xxviii yf we pray with that same purite of mind that they dyd? The scripture sayth:

Who so euer beleuethe in God,Rom. x. Ioel. ii. Act. ii. shall not be confounded. For there is no differe~ce betwene Iewe  Gentyle. For one is LORDE of all, whiche is rytche ynough vnto all that call on hym. For whosoeuer shall call on the name of the LORDE, he shall be safe, Let vs therfore trust in God,Psa. lxi. poure out oure hartes before hym, lament our cause to him, desyrynge to haue his mooste gracious ayde  helpe in all our trouble  aduersitie, and we may be sure to obtayne whatsoeuer we aske accordynge vnto his wyll,1. Ioan. v.  to seale remedye so present, that no|thynge can be wysshed nerer.
Thus se we that Prayer is a lyf|tyng vp of a pure mynd vnto God. It followeth.


 The nynthe Chapter.
VUheri~ we aske somewhat of hi~ He that entendethe to praye w^t fruyte, muste before he begynne to praye, consider w^t hymselfe for what

thynge he hath moost nede to praye. If thou be proude, than haste thou nede to praye for humilitie. If thou be wrathfull  enuyous, than haste thou nede to praye for charite. If y^u be a glotton or dronkarde, the~ haste thou nede to praye for sobrtete. If y^u be faulte in ony vice, than hast thou nede to pray for y^e vertue co~trary to the vyce. If thou be a magistrate  ruler of the people, than hast y^u nede to praye vnto God for grace, that y^u mayste gouerne his people commyt|ted vnto thy charge accordyng to e|quite  mercy. Yf thou be a Bysshop or spirituall ouersear, tha~ hast thou a great occasion to flye vnto God w^t thy prayers, that thou mayst fayth fully gyue attendau~ce on the flocke, ouer whome the holye Ghoste hathe made the an ouersear to gouerne y^e congregacion of God, Act. xx. whom he hath purchased w^t his bloud. To be shorte in whatsoeuer state of lyuyng thou

be, yf y^u co~syderest  weyest depely w^t thy selfe thy maner of lyui~g, y^ shalt find sufficient occasions for to pray. They therfore which pray but for a customs,Note.  because they wyl exercise theyr lyppes, vnlesse they shuld seme to y^e Co~gregacio~ but a lytle deuout  holy me~, not cari~g what they pray so they praye,  do not before they praye determyne w^t the~selues wher+fore they wyll praye, certes thoughe they spende whole worldes in suche kinde of prayer, yet do they nothing lesse then praye. If we searche y^e ho|ly volumes of the deuine scriptures we shall easely perceyue, that they whiche prayed, dyd neuer praye but for vrgent and ryght necessary cau|ses. As for an example:Exo. xxxii. Whan Mo|ses perceyued the wrathe of God to be whotte agaynst the Israelites, bi+cause they had worshypped the gol|den calfe, he streyghte wayes for the helthe of his people prayed, sayenge:

Eyther forgyue the~ this faulte, or  thou do not, wype me oute of y^e boke of lyfe,Psal. l. whiche thou haste wrytten. Kynge Dauid prayed many tymes for dyuers vrge~t causes as we may se in the Psalmes.ii. Par. l. Kynge Salomo~ his sonne prayed for wisdome, that he myght gouerne the people a right Ezechias hearyng the blasphemies  proud crakes of Senacherib,ii. Re. xix Iudi. x.xii Hest. xiiii. prai|ed to the LORDE for helpe. Iudith  Hester prayed for the delyueraunce of theyr people.
Luk. xviii. Mat. iii.Agayne in the newe Testament, the blynde prayed for theyr syght, y^e lame for theyr goynge, the deafe for theyr hearynge, the sycke for theyr helth.Luk. xviii Mat. xv. Mat. viii. Luk. xxiii. The poore Publicane prayed for remission of synnes. The woma~ of Canane prayed for the healthe of her doughter, as dyuers other dyd for theyr chyldren and seruauntes. Christ  Steuen prayed for theyr e|nemies.Act. vii. Act. xii. The chyrch of Christ praied

for the delyuerance of Peter. Paule  al the Apostles prayed for y^e swifte  redye passage of the Gospell,  for the fortunate conuersion of the vn|faythfull, vnto the fayth of Christ. Thus se we that all holye  deuoute persons dyd euer premeditate with them selues, wherfore they shoulde pray before they prayed. And so sone as an occasion of prayenge was offe+red vnto the~, they fell streyghtway|es vnto prayer,  fled vnto God w^t moost herty supplicacion for y^e pur|chasynge of theyr hertes desyre. So ought we to do,  not rasshely to mu~+ble ouer a great multitude of Psal+mes or other prayers after the ma|ner of certayne ydiots  vnlearned prestes, we care not how, nor ca~ not tell wherfore, but ponder, weye and consyder depelye oure cause, and se what a greate occasion we haue to praye,  than with an hu~ble co~tryte  sorowfull herte lament our cause

before God wyth moost bytter  he|uy teares, neuer leauynge vntyl we haue obtayned that for the whyche we praye. If we would do thus, tha~ should our prayers be modest, sober  dece~t,  not temerarious, asshe,  babled oute of order,  by this mea|nes accepted of GOD, hearde and graunted.
Thus haue I declared as I trust accordynge vnto the vayne of y^e ho|ly scripture,  the mynde of the aun+cie~t Doctors, what prayer is. Now I wyll haste to declare of what ver|tue  stre~gth the true and Christen prayer is, y^e men knowyng y^e efficacy  dignite, yea  the necessite therof, may w^e y^e more plansible  ioyful mi~ des delyght in it, exercysynge them selues therin bothe daye  nyght to the great glorye of God,  the vtter co~fusion of Satan,  the hygh con|solacion of theyr owne soules.




Of what vertue and strength the true and Christen Prayer is.

 The. x. Chap.
_IN declaryng the effica|cye, vertue, strength,  power of the true  chri+shen Prayer, I woulde gladly wysshe vnto me the pleasaunt speache  sugred vtte+raunce of the moost famous  excel|lent Oratoure Pericles. whose elo|quence was so great  wonderous, as it is reported, that euen of very nature it semed incomparable; and not of i~ any part able of ony mortal man to be followed  practised, of so great admyracion, yea  estimacion in the syght of all men was it recou~+ted. But seynge that my wysshe in this behalfe is vayne,  that ther is no man more barbarous and of lesse





eloque~ce then I am.1. Cor. 1. Iaco. ii. Agayne, seyng that God hathe euer chosen the foo|les  vnwyse of this worlde to sette forth his glorye  to confounde the wisdome of the worldelye wyse, and the vnderstandynge of the flesshelye mynded, seynge also that the trueth of Gods wisdome hath no nede of or nate eloque~ce nor painted coloures, which of the faythful for all the sim+plicite of it,The pray|er of the Author. is euer amplexed  recei+ued ioyfully, I shall moost instant|ly desyre God, that he may so direct my pen  instyll on such maner into my brest the knowledge of the moost holy Hystories of the sacred scriptu|res, which abou~dantly declare how mighty in operacion the true  chri+sten prayer is, that I by rehearsyng them,  Gods mooste holye Spiryte workynge therwith also maye so ac|cend, kyndle, inflame,  fette on fyre Christen mennes hertes with y^e loue of faythfull prayer, that they maye

vnfaynedly reioyse in the continual exercyse  godly meditacion therof.
By prayer Abraham delyuered kyng Abimelech fro~ deth,Gen. xx. which god thretened hi~, bycause he had take~ to him Abrahams wyfe. And where as God had stryken the kynges wyfe  handmaydens with the vyce of steri+lite and barennes for the aforesayde fault, at Abraha~s prayer they were made whole.Exo. viii. By prayer Moses cea|sed and turned awaye the plages of Egypte.Exo. vii. By prayer Moses caused y^e water to flowe oute of y^e hard rocke.

By prayer, whe~ god was full determined to slaye the Is|raelites, bycause they worshypped the golden caulfe, Moses apeased y^e diuine wrath,  reco~cyled the people to the fauoure of God. By prayer

By prayer the Gospell of Christe hath euer had felyce  fortu+nate progresse.ao. v. By prayer we  made safe in our syckenes. By  ex the conuersyon of the Gentyles

came fortunately to passe. By pray|er the glory of God hath euer be pro+moted. By prayer y^e chyrch of Christ hath euer had the victory ouer An|techristes Sinagoge. To conclude, by prayer all good thynges chaunse vnto vs,  without prayer nothyng prospereth with vs fortunately. If I shoulde go forth to recyte all y^e Hi|stories of the holye Byble, y^e make to the auau~cement of prayer, I should contexe  make a worke longer tha~ the Iliades of the Greke Poet Ho|mere. But of these fewe Histories heretofore rehearsed, the faythful  Christen reader maye ryght well de|prehende  perceyue, what efficacy, vertu, strength  power is in y^e true  Christen prayer. Howe can prayer be onye otherwyse then a thynge of great excellency, seynge that the ho|ly Ghost was the Author of it, seing also that so many i~co~perable thi~ges by it haueben obtained  so many de|uine

matters brought to passe?Luk. xvi: mat. xxvi. No man therfore oughte to doubte of y^e dignite of it, seyng y^e Jesus Christ godsowne son dyd both very dilige~t lyat al times,  in al fortunes  chau~+ses, yea  y^e both night  day exercise it,  also not only comaund other to pray,mat. vi. but lykewyse taught  prescri|bed the moost godly way of praye~g. Christes Apostles also with Marye the mother of Jesu,Act. i:  other holy wo|me~ perseuered togyther very much in fastinge  prayeng after Christes Ascencion, as we read in the Aces of the Apostles.
I could gather here many thiges out of y^e olde Histories, which should declare vnto vs howe greatly y^e aun+cient fathers of Christes chyrch de|lighted i this godly exercyse of pray+er,Df. Ia|mes Note as we reade in S. Iames, whose knees thorowe the continuall vse of knelynge in his prayers had greate wrattes or wennes, call them what

ye wyll for all me, growynge vpon them after the maner as Camelles haue, but my mynde is not to sette forth y^e co~mendacio~, prayse  auau~ce me~t of prayer by ony Histories, but only those, whiche are co~tayned in y^e holy scripture. Notwithstandynge seyng that hytherto I haue fortres|sed this my treatise w^t the sayenges of y^e godly learned Doctors, I wyll therfore nowe rehearse a sentence or two of the golden mouthed Doctor S. Iohn~ Chrisostome, whiche shall not a lytle make to the auaunceme~t of y^e true and christen prayer.


 The. xii. Chapter.
DErely beloued prayer vndoub|tedly,Hom. lxxix. De oratio~e sayth he, is an exceading good thynge and great treasure. For yf he that talketh with a vertu+ous man receyueth by that meanes no small profytte, howe many co~mo+dities then shall he enioye, to whom it is gyuen to talke w^t GOD? It is

impossible forsoth it is impossible for that ma~ which prayeth aryght and maketh continuall supplicacion vn to God, for to synne at any tyme. For the fountaines of water do not make gardyns so fertyle, and fruyt+full, as the fou~taynes of teares wa|teringe the plante of prayer, make it to exercyse  growe vp vnto a be|ry great heyght,  sette hym y^e pray|eth before the LORD. Hereof co~meth it to passe y^t he must neded  heard.
Ser primo De oa.Agayne he sayth, as the Sonne is the light vnto the body, so is pray+er vnto the soule. Prayer getteth an holy lyfe,  the congrue, decente and semely worshyppyng of God,  after a meruaylous manner it layeth vp treasure for our soules. For whither that a man wyll labour to kepe vir+ginite,By prayer al thinges are easye. or in mariage reuerentlye to mayntayne continencye, or to sup|presse wrath,  to lyue mekely, or to repurge enuy, or to do any other de|cent

 comely thynge, prayer beyng his guyde,  preparyng such a way to the life, he shal vndoubtedly haue a quiet  easye passage vnto Godly|nes. For it is not possible, but that they whiche aske of God purenes of lyuynge, iustyce, mekenes  benigni+te, muste nedes obtayne it by pray|eng.Mat. vii Luke. x. For he sayth, aske  it shal be gi+uen you. Seake and ye shall fynde. Knocke  it shall be opened to you. For eueryone y^e asketh, receyueth,  he that seaketh fyndeth,  to hym y^e knocketh, it shall be opened.
Prayer receaueth vs full of syn|nes,Ser Serf do De o, and streyghtwayes maketh vs cleane. Prayer is the presente reme|dy for y^e soules of the~ that are sycke. Prayer doth not onlye make cleane fro~ sin, but also put a backe great pe+relles. Prayer is  is truly called a celestiall panoply  heauenly arma|ture,  that alone is able valeau~tely to preserue the~, which haue consecra|ted

them selues vnto it. So that w^t oute prayer no good nor wholesome thynge shall chaunse vnto vs.
Ibidem.Prayer is the head of all goodnes  the conciliatryce and purchaser of helth  euerlastynge lyfe. Prayer is the cause of all vertue and iustyce. Prayer is the occasion of health, the purchaser of an immortal soule, the ure bulwarke of the Chyrche, the in concusse, vnshake~  puissaunt custo|dy or watch of the faythful, terrible to the dyuelles, but healthful to the godly. Prayer hath wayting on her all vertues. To be breue, loke what the foundacio~ is in an house, y^e bery same is prayer in the soule.
Hytherto haue I rehearsed y^e wor+des of the golden mouthed Doctor, whiche declare manifestlye of howe great vertue and strength the true and Christen prayer is.
Of these thynges the~ heretofore rehearsed, haue we sufficiently lear|ned

what an excedynge and inco~pa|able treasure prayer is to y^e soule of  christen man. Certes whyther we aue respecte to the commoditie of ur body or of oure soule, prayer is he only meanes, wherby it is obtai+ned  broughte to passe.Duiius martialis Be God ne|ter so angrye with vs, prayer apea|ed his wrathe, as the Poet sayeth. lectitur ixatus, uoce rogante Deus. Et. Domi um mundi flectere uota ualent.Beholde what pray+er dothe. If we be si|ull, prayer purifyethe vs. If we be+arre~, prayer maketh vs fruytfull. f we be sycke, prayer makethe vs whole. If we be ygnora~t, prayer en|graffeth knowledge in vs. If we be lynd, prayer illumineth our senses. If we be co~fortles, prayer is redy to ssyst  helpe vs. If we be sorowfull, prayer co~forteth vs. If we be poore, prayer entychethe vs. If we be pro|phane, prayer maketh vs holye. If we be carnall, prayer maketh vs spi|rituall. If we be captiues of Sata~,

praier maketh vs the derely beloued so~nes of god. If we wa~te ony thing Prayer is redy to get it for vs. To conclude, yf we be euell, prayer ma|keth vs good. If we be good, prayer maketh vs better,  neuer forsaketh vs vntyll he hath broughte vs vnto the presence of almighty God in his eternal glory. What would we haue more? Seyng that so large co~modi|ties  great profittes come vnto vs by the true  christen prayer, let vs cast awaye all sluggyshnes, and exer+cyse our selues maynly in the moost godly meditacion of vertuous pray+er. By this meanes doubteles shall vyce decrease  minish in vs,  co~tra+rywyse vertue shall augment  en|crease very muche bothe in bodye  soule. And y^e this thing may be done the more conuenie~tly, I wyll nowe by Gods fauour declare howe a chri+sten man should prepare hymselfe to pray, y^e by no meanes he maye abuse this great and syngulare treasure.



How a Christen man shoulde prepare hymselfe to praye.

 The. xiii. Chapter.
_ALthough ther be so ma|ny thynges to be consy|dered in the godly exer|cyse of praier,Eyther thin+ges are to be consyde+red in the repeparar n of pray+er. y^e we may praye aryghte, yette me thynke that eyghte thynges chefely aboue all other muste be consydered  obserued in it, without the whiche o ma~ can prepare hymselfe to praye accordyng vnto the wyll of God. Of theyse eyghte therfore wyll I nowe speake in order by the assistence and helpe of Gods moost holy Spiryte, whome I moost insta~tly desyre so to directe my pen, that I maye wryte all thynge vnto the glorye of God,  the profytte of his holy churche. Fyrst it is requisyte, that he whiche

entendeth to pray, consydereth dep+ly w^t himselfe his state  case wherin he sto~deth. If he doth thus, tha~ shal he fynde that to be true, whiche th Psalmograph wryteth:Ps. xxxviii Euery man that lyueth is nothyng out altogy|ther very vanite.Psa. lxi. Agayne, the chyl|dren of men are vayne. They are ly|ers  false, in asmuche that yf y^u put|test the~  vanite togyther in a bal|launce, vanite wyll surely wey them vp.Esal. xi. All fleshe is grasse,  all his glory is lyke a floure of the felde.
Gen. vi.Moreouer he shal easely perceyue that all hys senses  thoughtes are prone to euell,  that he is not able of him selfe to thike a good thought. Agayne,ii. Cor. iii. he shall shortely vndersto~de that his herte is wycked  inscruta+ble,Iere. vii. Esa. i.  that ther is no whole parte in hym from the toppe of the head to y^e soole of the fote, but that in all his thoughetes, wordes  dedes, he is a verye synner  greuous offender of

the diuyne maiestye. Thus must he fyrst of all, wha~ he ente~deth to pray, consyder with hym selfe what he is, euen a very synner, a trangressoure of Gods precepte, a breker of the di|uyne lawe, and a wycked doer in all his actes.
This consideracion fyrst of all is very necessary. For it bringeth a ma~ to the knowledge of hym selfe,  ma|kethe hym desyrous for to praye, that he maye be deliuered fro~ this great enormite.Mark this well. Certes except a man doth fyrst of all on this wyse iudge, vndersto~de  perceyue of him+selfe, he can neuer be trulye bent for to praye. For who desyrethe the co|lour  warmenes of clothe, that fe|leth no colde? Who longeth for meat  drynke, that is not hungry  thyr+sty. Who wyssheth helth that is not sycke? Who prayeth for remission of synnes, that fealeth not himselfe to be a synner?iiii. Reg. xx. Esa. xxxiii. Woulde Ezechias haue

prayed for health  longe lyfe, yf he had not felte hymselfe sycke  at the poynt of death?ii. Para. i. Woulde Salomon haue desyred wisdo~e for the right go+uernau~ce of his people, yf he had not perceiued,ii. Re xii. Psal. i. that he had had nede of it? Woulde Dauid when he had played the adulterer with Bethsabe y^e wyfe of Urias, so greatly haue lamented his synne, yf he had not knowe~ hym selfe to be a greuous synner?Luk. x viii. Would the poore Publican contrary to the ma~ners of the proude Pharise haue stonde a farre of, beynge afrayde to lyfte vp his eyes, and knockyng his brest, sayeng: O God be thou merci|full vnto me a synner, yf he had not knowen himselfe to be full of synne, misery  wretchednes?Luk. vii.x. Would Ma|ry magdalene haue ben so desyrous of Christes company, yf she had not knowen herselfe to be a miserable si|ner, and Christ a bounteous Sauy|vor? Nay verely.
Therfore the nexte  moost redy waye for a man to prepare hymselfe to praye aright,  with a feruent spi+ryte  hungry mynde, is to knowe  grau~t hymselfe to be a synner, and y^e therfore he hath great nede to pray.


 The. xiiii. Chapter.
SEco~dly, whe~ he hath once thorow+ly debated  beaten w^e hiselfe his owne misery, wretchednes, synne,  abhominacio~,  perceyuethe that to be delyuered therof, ther is no other waye, but only by the mercy of God thorowe prayer, he muste streyghte wayes set before his eyes the Com|maundement of God, which after y^e knowledge  confession of his synne commaundeth hym to praye. And here ought he not a lytle to reioyse. For who, wha~ he hath ones offended God, durste be so bolde as once to de+syre pardon of his offence,  to pray vnto God for mercy, yf God himself had not commaundes him so to do?

Uerely no man.Beholde what sinne both. For the transgressi+on of Gods co~maundement doth so confounde the consicience of y^e tra~s|gressour, that it soner dryueth hym vnto desperacion, than to any hope of helpe or fauour.Gen. iii. This is well pro|ued by Adam, which, when he hadde once broken Gods precepte in Para+dyse, fled streyghtwayes from y^e face of God, hyd hym,  soughte all mea|nes possible no more to come i~to his syght.Gen. iiii. Howe was Caym also confou~+ded in his conscience whe~ he had kyl+led his brother Abell, thoughe there was yet no lawe raygnynge? Was he not so consternate  stryken with suche feare, that he sayd: Euery one that fyndeth me, wyll kyll me? was he not ashamed so greatly of his ma~ slaughter, that he sayd, mine iniqui+te is greater the~ I maye deserue for gyuenes? Dyd he not flye fro~ y^e face of the LORDE, so farre as he myght. Agayn,Mat. xxvi was not Iudas so ashamed

of his dede whan he had solde Christ to the Bysshoppes  heade prestes, y^e he brought the mony agayne to the~,  sayde, I haue synned, betrayenge the innocent bloud?Act. ii Dyd not synne so co~fou~d  slay his co~scie~ce at y^e last, that he went  ha~ged vp hymselfe,  when he was hanged, dydde not he brast a su~der in the myddes, and all his bowels gusshed out? Who being a Traytoure dare come before the Kynges maiesty to desyre pardon of his offence? Yea who rather beynge fauty in that detestable sinne, fieth not from hys graces presence in to straunge countreyes, that he maye be free and withoute punyshment? For the rewarde of synne is deathe.Rom. vi. Therfore I saye ought he that kno|weth  grau~teth himselfe to be a sin+ner very muche to reioyce that God for his offence hath co~maunded him to praye, whiche els durst nothynge lesse than once to atte~pte for to ap|proche

before the diuyne maiesty w^e onye kynde of prayer,The natu+re of sinne  when synne shall laboure accordynge vnto y^e na|ture therof for to condemne the con+science,  to expell from the herte all sayth, co~fidence,  trust in God, tha~ to erecte, eleuate  lyfte vp himselfe by gyuyng sure  vndoubted fayth to the co~mau~dement of God, which commaundeth hym to praye, w^e this perswasion, that God hath not com+mau~ded him for to praye in vayne. He muste therfore put these  suche lyke Comaundementes euer before his eyes,Mat. vi. Psal. xlix. Mat. xi. Aske, Seke, Knocke, watch praye. Agayne, call on me in the day of trouble. Come vnto me al ye that labour  are lade~. All ye that thyrst come vnto the waters.Esa. xliiii. And ye that haue no mony make hast, by  eate. Come  bye withoute mony,  with+oute ony marchaundyse, wyne and mylke. These moost gentle  louyng commaundementes of God co~forte

the sorowefull mynde of the synner greatly,  engraffe in him a certayn gladnes  hope for to obtayne remis+sio~ of his synnes, seyng y^e God so bou~+teonsly commaundeth him to pray.


 The. xv. Chapter.
THyrdely when he hathe on this maner poudered the co~maunde+ment of God, wherw^t he is prouoked to praye, than doth co~uenient tyme requyre that he also consydereth the moost louynge, gentle,  bounteous promises of God, in the which he pro+myseth for to heare vs,  to graunte vs oure peticions. For what doth it profyt for to aske  not to obtayne? If God had only co~maunded vs to praye, and not also promysed for to heare vs,  gentelly to gyue vs oure desyres, what greate pleasure had he done for vs? what had he done for the which we had nede once to saye, LORDE God a mercy? What syngu|lare benefite had we receyued of hi?

But although y^e Co~maundement to pray putteth vs i good confort, yet wha~ we are promysed also gracious+ly to be heard, this maketh vs vnfai+nedly to reioyce  seriouslye to try|umph. This maketh vs to put oure of oure herte all doloure  sadnes,  to be replete with all myrthe  glad|nes. The promyses of God brynge quietnes to the conscience,The pro|mysce of God. huarite to the herte, tranquilitie  peace to the soule. No man is able to expresse howe much  howe great ioye lyeth buried vp in the diuyne promises,  how feruent consolacion the synner taketh by the hearyng of the~.Gen. iii. What ioye thynke ye was thys vnto Ada~ for to heare after his offence, that y^e sonne of GOD should be borne of a pure mayde,  tread downe the Ser+pe~tes head, that is, subdue Sata~  deliuer Adam w^t all his posterite fro~ his tyranny, bryng the~ agayne into the fauoure of God,  make the~ hey|res

of eternall glory?Gen. xxii. What co~forte I praye you was this to faythefull Abraha~ for to heare that in his seed all nacious of the earthe shoulde be blessed? What a great pleasure was this to y^e Israelites,Num. xxi. whe~ they were greuously stynged  slayne of the fy+ry serpentes for theyr disobedience, to heare this promyse of God: make a brase~ serpe~t,  set it vp for a signe He that is stryken  loketh vpon it, shall lyue?Iosue. i. What exceadyng co~forte receyued Iosue by thys promyse of God vnto him: I wyll not leaue the neyther wyll I forsake the. Be ther|fore stro~ge  take a good herte vnto the? As I maye come nerer to oure matter,Ioel. ii. Act. ii. Rom. x. howe much ioye, consolacio~  pleasure haue the faythfull fealte of this one promyse of God: Euerye one that callethe on the name of the LORDE, shall be saued?
Therfore in this behalfe the pro+mises of God must be earnestly way|ed,

 pondered  consydered.The pro|myses of God are oure only conforte. In them must we reste,  dailye as in a moost pleasau~t Herboure. In the~ must we repose oure selues. In them must be all oure delyghte, pleasure  felicite. The chefe promises concernynge Prayer are these.Psa. xxxvi. Delyghte thou in the LORDE,  he shall giue the, the pe+ticio~s of thy herte.Psal xlix. Call on me sayth God in the daye of thy trouble,  I wyll delyuer the, and thou shalte ho+nour me.Psa. ixxxx Agayne he sayth: Seynge that he hath put his truste in me, I wyll delyuer hym,  I wyll defende hym, in asmuche as he hath knowen my name. He cryed vnto me, and I wyll graciously heare hym, I am w^e hym in tribulacion, I wyll delyuer hym  glorify hym. With the length of dayes wyll I replenysh hym, and shewe hym my sauynge helth. Christ also saith:Mat. xi. Come vnto me all ye that labour  are laden,  I shall refresh you. Euery one that is a thyrste, let

hym come to me  drynke.Ioan. vii. Mat. vi. Agayne, aske,  it shall be gyuen you. Seke  ye shall fynde. Knocke  it shall be o|pened vnto you. For euery one that asketh, receyueth,  he that seketh, fyndeth,  to hym y^e knocketh, it shal be opened. If the sone asketh breade of ony of you, whiche is his father, wyl ye profer him a stone? or yf he as+keth fysh,Luke. xi. wyll ye gyue hym a Ser|pent? or yf he aske an Egge, wyll ye profer hym a Scorpion? If ye than which are euell, know howe to gyue good gyftes to your chyldren, howe much more shall your father celesti|all gyue the holy ghost to them that desyre it of hym? These  suche lyke promises of God, must he that inte~|deth to pray set before his eyes, that he co~forted with the remembraunce of them, maye with the more fra~cke courage gyue himselfe to godly and deuout prayer at all tymes.


 The .xvi. Chapter.
Fayth gy|uen vnto the promy+ses of godFOurthly when he hath on this maner confyrmed  establyshed his mynde with the conte~placion  beholdynge of the diuyne promises, he maye not dout any thynge at all of them, but faythfully beleue  vn|doutedly perswade hymselfe y^e they are true, in asmuch as they are the promises not of man but of GOD, which ca~ not lye,Cit. l. Psa. cxliiii whiche is true, yea whiche is the selfe trueth, whiche is faythfull in all his wordes,  holy in al his workes, whose worde  trueth also abyde for euer and euer.Esay. xi. For though God be neuer so mercyfull,  bounteous in gyftes,Note wel. yet yf we do not beleue that his mercy  bounte pertayne also to vs, we are neuer y^e better. Let it so be, that wha~ a tray tour for his offence co~mitted agenst the Kynges maiesty,Mark this Example flyeth beyonde the sees into a straung countrey by cause he wyll eschewe the daunger of the lawe,  escape y^e payne due for

his offence, the Kynges grace hathe pitie on hym, pardon his faulte, and sende ouer his letters vnto hym, wheri~ is declared the kynges great mercy  gentlenes toward him, and wylleth hym to returne into his na|tyue countre,  there agayne to en|ioye the benefytes of the same,  of all other that he possessed before, yea  that with no lesse fauoure, than he dydde in tymes paste, whan he was mooste estraunged from that faulte of treason: yf the Traytour not bele+uynge the wordes of the moost gra|cious  free pardon, woulde conte~ne  despyse it, recountyng it to be but a vayne gloose,  of no trueth, what should the kynges gentlenes in this behalfe profytte hym? The kynge is mercyfull, but the traytoure is vn|faythfull. Therfore receyueth he no commoditie by the kynges pardon. And yet is not the faulte in y^e kyng, but in the traytour, which beleueth

not that glad and merye tydynges.
Another example.Agayne: Be it in case, that a cun+nyng  learned Phisicio~ come vnto a sycke man, promisynge hym helpe  delyueraunce of his dysease,  yet yf the sycke parso~ beleueth hym not, but setteth nought by hym,  despy|seth his medicines what doth it pro+fytte him? What is he holpen by the presence of the Phisicio~, be he neuer so cu~nynge? What doth the redines of helpe profyt him, yf he refuseth to take  enioye it? Uerely nothyng at all. In lyke maner be God neuer so mercyfull  bou~teous,  neuer so re|dy to helpe vs, yet yf we beleue hym not to be so, his mercye, bounty and assiste~ce profyt vs nothynge at all.Psa. cxliiii The Psalmograph sayeth not only, the LORDE is nygh to all that cal on hym, but he addeth, to al that call on hym in trueth.To cal on God in truethe, what it is What is it to call on God in trueth, but to beleue earnest+ly that he wyll trulye performe hys

promyses,  do in all thynges as he hath promysed?Psa. lxxxiiii. Agayne, Dauid say+eth: Mercy  trueth haue mette to|gyther, ryghteousnes  peace haue kyssed one another.Mark this Exposicio~ What is this, mercy  trueth haue mette togither but that as God is mercyfull in ma+kynge his promises, so is he true in perfourmynge them? Agayne, what meaneth this, righteousnes  peace haue kyssed one another, but only to shewe, that the ryghteousnes of god in fulfyllynge his promises, and the tra~quilite of co~science haue ioyned them selues togyther in the hertes of the faythfull.
Therfore yf we do not obtayne y^e hygh treasures  great pleasures y^e God hath promised let vs impute it to nothynge els but only to our vn|faithfulnes.Heb. xi. For S. Paule sayth w^e out fayth it is not possible to please God. He that co~meth to God, sayth he, must beleue that God is,  that

he is a rewarder to the~ that seke h.Rom. v. Agayn, we beyng iustifyed by fayth haue peace toward God thorow our LORDE Iesus Christ, by whome also it hathe chaunsed vnto vs, that by fayth we should be brought i~to this grace, wherin we stond,  prayse vn+der the hope of the glorye of GOD. S. Iames also sayeth,Iacob. i. If ony man wanteth wisdome lette hym aske of hym that gyueth it, I meane God, which gyueth to all men w^tout dou|blenes,  casteth no man into y^e teth,  it shalbe gyuen him. But let hym aske in fayth  wauer not. For he y^e doubteth, is lyke the waues of y^e see, tossed of the wynde,  caried with vi+olence. Neyther let that ma~ thynke y^t he shal receyue ony thynge of God Christ also sayeth,Math. xi. Who soeuer shall saye to this mountayne, take away thy selfe,  cast thy selfe into the see,  shall not wauer in his harte, but shal beleue that these thinges which

he sayth, shall come to passe, what so+euer he sayth, shalbe done vnto him. Therfore I saye vnto you, what so|euer ye desyre when ye praye, beleue that ye shall haue it,  it shalbe done to you. Agen he saith haue ye y^e faith of GOD, y^e is to saye, asure pswasio~  confydence of the promyses of the grace  mercy of God,  learne ye to assent  agre to the diuyne promyse which thyng yf ye shall do, verely I saye vnto you, all thynges that ye aske whan ye praye, beleue y^e ye shall receyue them,  they shall chau~se to you, as he sayth, al that euer ye aske whan ye praye, beleue that ye shall haue the~,  they shall chaunse vnto you,Math. ix. We read that whan two blynd men desyred Christe to make the~ for to se, he sayd vnto the~, do ye beleue y^e I am able to do this thynge? They aunswared, we beleue LORDE. Tha~ sayd Christe vnto the~, accordyng to your faythe, be it to you. And theyr

eyes were ope~. Agen wha~ a certayne ma~ brought his so~ne to Christ for to be healed, Christ said to him: If thou canst beleue y^t, al thinges are possible to hi~ y^t beleueth. In diuers other pla+ces we reade,Mat. ix. that Christ sayd to the~ who~e he heled. Be it vnto the accor|di~g to thy fayth. And thy fayth hath saued the. For by fayth are we mary to God.Lull. vii. Mat. xv. Oze. ii. Ioan. i. Gala. iii. By faythe are we made the sonnes of God. By faythe all good thynges chaunse vnto vs. Therfore that we maye be partakers of the co~+fortable promises of God, let vs ear nestly beleue the~, beyng perfectly p|swaded that what soeuer God hath promised, he wyll surely fulfyll it. For he is that trueth, which can ney+ther lye nor deceyue, but graunteth all thynges abosidantely to the~ that aske in faythe.In Luca~ Lap. xviii. Theophilacte hath a very golde~  notable sayenge, which is this. The foundacion  grounde of all prayer is fayth. For excepte a

ma~ doth beleue, that he shal receyue that to his profyt, which he asketh, the prayer that he maketh is vayn.
But yf it be so that we are yette weake,  haue no sure truste of y^e cle|mencye  great goodnes of God to|warde vs, nor can not perswade our+selues that our prayer is heard, but double  wauer peradue~ture of the diuyne promises,Luk. vii. than after the exa~+ple of y^e Apostles let vs pray, LORDE encrease our fayth. Yea let vs wyth teares crye oute  saye wyth the fa|ther of a certayne chylde.Mar. ix I beleue LORDE, succour  helpe myne incre|dulite  vnfaythfulnes. And y^e migh+ty ruler, which is a mercyfull  gen|tle God,Exo. xxxiiii. pacient, longe sufferynge  true, which kepeth mercy, which ta|keth away iniquite, wickednes and synne, wyl surely haue mercy on vs  encrease faythe in vs.Eco. ii. For the po|wer of the LORDE shall be with the~, which seke hym with al theyr affect,





herte and mynde.


 The. xvii. Chapter.
FYftely whan we aske ony thyng of God, we maye not aske it in our owne name, in our owne digni|te  worthynes, in our owne iustyce  righteousnes, in our owne good de+des  merites, in our owne innocen|cy and purenes,What it is to aske in the name of Christ. but in the name of Christ. What is it to aske in y^t name of Christ, but only to co~fesse that for our owne dignitie  worthynes, we are not worthy to be hearde,  ther|fore desyrynge to obtayne mercye, grace, fauour,  remission of our syn+nes, we approche vnto the throne of GOD with oure faythefull pray|ers, not in oure owne name, but in the name of Christe, that is to saye, in Christes dignite, worthynes iu|styce, ryghteousnesse, innocencye, purenes, good dedes  merites. And for his sake  for his goodnes do we desyre to be heard, and to haue oure

Peticions graunted:
This is a great co~forte for them that shall pray,A conforta+ble sayeng for . y^t though they be im|perfecte, yet is Christ perfecte,  his perfeccio~ is theyr perfeccio~, though they be vnrighteous, yet is Christe ryghteous,  his ryghteousnesse is their righteousnesse, though they be vnholy, yet is Christ holy,  his holi+nes is theyr holines, though they be voyde of perfecte good workes, yet hathe Christe perfecte good workes, and his good workes are theyr good workes, yf they leaue theyr vngodli+nes, turne from theyr wycked way|es,  study to lyue innocently,  ther+fore nede they not feare for to praye, but boldly to aske all thinges in the name of Christ.
Our righteous aduocate,In Czech. Lib. i. Nom. vii. sayeth S. Gregory, shall defende vs rygh|teous in the iudgement, bycause we do both knowledge  accuse our sel|ues vnrighteous. Therfore not in

our owne wepiges, not in our owne actes but in the allegacion of our ad+uocate let vs truste. Hereto pertay|neth the sayenge of S. Austen,In Psal. viii. the prayer which is not made by Christ doth not only not put awaye synne, but also the prayer it self is made ve+ry synne. Christ sayth, whatsoeuer ye shall aske in my name, that wyll I do, that the father maye be glory|fyed by y^e so~ne.Ioan. xiiii If ye aske ony thyng in my name, that shal I do. Agayne If ye abyde in me,  my wordes a|byde i~ you, aske what soeuer ye wyl,  it shall be done to you. In another place also he sayth:Ioan. xvi. Uerely verely I say to you, what soeuer ye shal aske the father in my name, he shall gyue it you. Nytherto ye haue asked no|thynge in my name. Aske  ye shall receyue, that your ioye maye be per+fect. Thus so we y^t in Christes name we must aske all thynges.Act. iiii. For there is none other name gyuen vnto me~

vnder heue~, wheri~ we must be saued but onlye this name of iesus christ. Euerye one y^t calleth on thys name shalbe saued.Joel. ii. Pro.xviii. For the name of the LORDE is a stronge tower  valeau~t Bulwarke, vnto that doth y^e righte+ous, that is, the faythefull man flye.Psal. xxxix. Blessed is that man, which tru|steth in the name of the LORDE, and hath no respecte vnto vanities and false madde fantasies.
Moreouer Dauid,Dauid. although God prayseth him greatly,  sayeth, that he hath founde Dauid his seruau~te euen after his owne herte, yet dyd not he, whan he prayed, desyre to be hearde for his owne name,  for his owne ryghteousnes  vertu, but he prayed on this maner,Psal. cxiii. LORDE heare my prayer, heare my request for thy truthes sake, yea fauourablye heare me for thy righteousnes, Agayne, in the O LORDE haue I trusted,Psal. xxx. let me neuer be co~fou~ded, but deliuer me in

thy righteousnes. My stre~gth and my refuge arte thou, and for thy na+mes sake shalte thou lede me forth  norish me.Psal. xxiiii For thi names sake LORD shalte thou be merciful to my sinne, for it is much. O god for thy names sake saue thou me,Psal. iiii.  in thy vertu de+lyuer me.Ps. lxxviii. Helpe vs O God our sauy+our,  for the glorye of thy name O LORDE delyuer vs,  be mercyfull to our synnes for thy names sake. Be|holde he desyreth not the fauoure of God for his owne sake, for his owne name, righteousnes, trueth  vertu but for Goddes name, for Goddes ryghteousnes, trueth and vertue. Nowe who is the ryghteousnesse of God,The righ|teousnes of God, is Christ. is Lord. but Iesus Christe the sonne of God, whiche alone is founde righte|ous among men? As Paule wytnes|seth, he is made of God our wisdom ryghteousnes, sanctificacion  rede~+cion, that as it is wrytten, he that reioyceth, maye reioyce in y^ LORDE

Who is the trueth of GOD,The truth of God. but he which sayth of himselfe. I am y^e way the trueth  the lyfe.Ioan. xiiii. The vertu of God. i. Pet. ii. No man com|meth to the father but by me? Who is y^e vertue of God, but he that hath done no synne, nor in whole mouth ony gile was fou~d, which is Christ . Auste~ wryteth of Christ on this ma+ner,Tract. xxii. in Io. cap. v. I am, sayth he, y^e way, trueth  lyfe. No man co~meth to the father but by me. As though he should say, wylte thou walke? I am the waye. Wylte thou not be deceyued? I am the trueth. Wylt thou not dy? I am y^e lyfe. This doth thy Sauyour say to the, ther is none other, to whome thou mayst go, but vnto me. There is no waye that thou canste go, but by me.
So that for Christes sake  not for his owne dyd Dauid althoughe both godly  vertuous, yea  dearly beloued of God, dre to be hearde,  to haue the peticions of his herte

graunted. obiecti+on. But it maye be obiected, Dauid also prayeth on this maner. Heare O LORDE my ryghteousnes,Psal. xvi.  gyue attendance vnto my prayer. Let my iudgement come forth from thy face, lette thyne eyes se equite. Thou hast proued my hert  visited it in the nyght, thou haste tryed me w^t fyre,  yet hath there none iniqui+te be found in me.Psal. xvii. Agayne, I wyl be w^tout spotte w^t him, I wyll kepe me from iniquite,  the LORDE shall re|warde me accordynge to my righte|ousnes,  accordynge to the puritie of my ha~des in the syght of his eies. Also in another place,Psal. xxv. Iudge me O LORDE, for I haue walked in my in|noce~cy. In these  such lyke Dauid layeth oute his owne innocency, pu|rite  ryghteousnes, ' semeth to de|syre to be heard for them.n answer I answere if Dauid desyred to be heard for his owne ryghteousnes, than should he fyght w^t himselfe wherin many and

diuers places he co~fesseth his synne,  cleueth only to the mercy of God, desyreth to be hearde for the righte|ousnes, trueth  vertue of God, and not for his owne sake. Enter not in to iudgement, O LORDE, sayeth he, with thy seruaunt, for no man that lyueth shalbe iustifyed in thy syght. Nowe tha~ could he set out his owne ryghteousnes before GOD, that he myghte be iustifyed by it? What shall we then saye to this matter?Note thys Solucion: I aunswere, yea  that not wythoute the authoritie of the holy scriptures  the mynde of the aunciente Doc|tors, that as in dyuers other places of the Psalmes, so in these and such lyke he speakethe in the parsonne of Christe, and not in his owne. He spe+keth of Christes innocency, puryte, ryghteousnes  vertue,  not of his owne. He representeth Christes par|son,  not his owne. Whan he spea|keth in his owne parson, he graun|teth

hymselfe alwayes a synner, se|keth helth of God,  desyreth not to be heard for his owne ryghteousnes but for Gods ryghteousnes, whiche is Iesus Christ. So that i~ Christes name he offered vp his prayers vnto God the father,Exo. xii. Ioan. i. as all the faythfull ought to do. For Christ is the lambe w^tout spotte. Christ is that lambe of God, which taketh away y^e synne of the worlde.Mat. iii. Christ is that dearly be|loued sonne, for whose sake God the father is well pleased with men. Christ is that Byshop,Heb. vii. which is god+ly, innocente, vndefyled  segregate from synners.Ioan. x. Christ is the dore, by whome alone we muste come to the father.Math. i. Christ is that sauiour which saueth his people fro~ theyr synnes. Christ is he by whome grace  very|tie is shewed vnto vs.Ioan. 1. Colos. 1. Christe is he, which by his moost precious bloude hath reconciled vs to Gody^e father. Christ therfore is he, in whose name that is, in whose dignite, ryghteous|nes, innocency, vertue,  purite, we must offer vp our prayers to God y^e father.Esa. lxiiii. For all our ryghteousnesses ampared to the iustyce of God, are yke a cloth polluted with me~strue. That we are not able to obtayne a|ny thynge of God for our owne righ+teousnes, it is manifest by these wor+des which God himselfe speaketh by his Prophet Esaye,Esa. xliii. I am, I am he, which putteth awaye thyne iniqui|ties, yea  that for myne owne sake. (Marke y^e he sayeth, for myne owne sake.) And wyll reme~ber thy synnes no more. Put me in remembrau~ce,  let vs be iudged togyther. Tell me yf thou hast ony thing wherby thou mayst be iustifyed.Esa. xlviii. Agayne: For my names sake, wyll I put away myne anger. For myne owne sake, yea for mine owne sake wyll I do this, that I may not be blasphemed  euel spo+ken of. In the name of Christe ther|fore

let hym aske, that ente~denth to obtayne onye thynge of God the fa+ther, as S. Paule sayeth,Col. iii. whatsoe|uer ye shall do in word  dede, do an thynges in the name of the LORDE Iesus, gyuynge thanckes to God the father by him. And so doynge let hym not doubt, but that he shall ob|tayne all good thynges accordyng vnto his hertes desyre.


 The .xviii. Chapter.
All thynge must be as+hed accor|dyng vnto  wyll of God.SYxtely, he that inte~deth to pray, muste earnestly prouyde that he asketh all thynges accordyng vnto the wyll of God. He may not aske af ter his owne fantasy, wyl  plesure, but after the wyll of God. For oure wyll in comparison of Gods wyll, is neuer good, but euell or prone to e|uell. For we knowe not what we shoulde praye,Rom. viii. as it becommeth vs. Therfore what so euer we aske, we must refece it vnto y^e wyll of God, and be contented to be ordered in all

thynges accordyng vnto his moost olye wyll, as Christe taughte vs to raye in the Pater noster. Let thy wyll be fulfylled as in heaue~,Mat. vi. so lyke wyse in earth. Christe also himselfe for to gyue vs an example, when the oure of his passion began to drawe igh, prayed vnto his father on this manner: My father, yf it be possible, et this cup go awaye from me:Math. xxvi. Not withstandyng let not myne but thy wyll be fulfylled.mat. viii. The Leper also ayd to Christ, LORDE yf thou wylt, hou maist make me whole Here the Leper desyred to be clensed of his le|rosye, yet he referred his requestes vnto Christe eyther to be graunted or denyed.Nota. So it beco~meth vs i~ lyke maner to aske all thynges accordi~g vnto the wyll of God,  what soeuer we desyre, euer to submyt  referre t vnto Gods wyll, whiche knoweth este, what we haue nede of,  what s moost necessarye for vs,math. vi. before we

pray. For we haue not a greter war re nor an harder fyght i~ this world than y^e battayle  stryfe of the Spi ryte,  of y^e fleshe, which two are al wayes so at debate, y^e the hatred be twene the~ can neuer be apeased.Gal. v. For as y^e flessh lusteth agaynst y^e spiryte so doth the spiryte fight very valea~t ly agaynst the wycked, fearce  cruel violence of the fleshe,  are euermore as the Apostle wytnesseth, one age~s another,Rom. vii. so that we can not do those thinges y^e we would, in asmuch that we are compelled to crye oute w^e the Apostle, o wretched  vnhappy that I am, who shall delyuer me fro~ thys body bonde vnto death.
Howe euell it is to followe oure owne wyll, neglectynge in y^e meane season the good pleasure of God, dy|uers Histories of y^e holy scriptures shewe. Kyng Saul thought that he had done well,1. Reg. xiii. when he perceyuyng the people to go away from hym, of|fered

burnte offrynges to y^e LORDE in the absence of Samuel, sayenge, that he dyd it to pacifye the LORDE,  that he was co~pelled to do so. But Samuell sayd vnto hym, thou hast done folisbly, neither hast thou kept the co~maundementes of the LORDE thy God whiche I co~maunded the.
Agayne God co~maunded Sauli. Reg. xl. to staye Amelech, to destroye al that euer ther was, not to spare one, not to couyt any thyng of theyr goodes, but to kyll man, woman, chylde, sue kynge babe, ore, shepe, camell, asse,  what soeuer could there be sound be+sydes. But Saul followi~g his own wyll more than the wyll of God, spa|red Agag the king of Amelech alyue with the beste flockes of shepe, ores, cattell,  all that euer was fayre he spared,  woulde not destroye them, but what soeuer was vyle and of no pryce, that he destroyed. Whan Sa|muel came vnto hym  sayde, what

of beastes do I heare here? He auswe red, the people hathe broughte them from Amelech. They be the best and fattest of all the flockes,  they be re|serued to be offered vnto the LORDE. But Samuel sayde vnto hym. By|cause thou hast cast awaye the word of y^e LORD, y^u LORD hath cast away y^e that thou be no more king. Wyll the LORD burnt offringes  sacrifices  not rather that it may be obeyed vn to his worde? Obedience is better then Sacrifyces,  to gyue eare to y^e LORDES co~maundement is more tha~ to offer the satte of wethers. What godly excuses had kynge Saul here to couer his faulte, and to make his wyll vnto carnall iudgeme~tes to ap+peare verye vertuous  godly? For all that euer he dyd, was done to ho+nour God,A poynte for theyr linge. to sacrifice  offer oblaci|ons to God. Yet God casteth awaye that wyll, whiche is contrary to his wyll, seme it neuer so godlye, vertu|ous

and good in the syght of fleshly wyse me~. Yea cursed be all good wyl+les, all good zeeles, all good inte~tes, that fyghte w^e the wordes of God.
Oza also thought he had done welii. Reg. vi. when he seyng the arke of God in io|pardy of fallyng oute of the wayne, steyed it w^e his hande, yet for all hys good voyl, bicause he touched it, was he stryken of the LORDE,  streyghte waye dyed.
Kynge Ozias in lyke maner of aii. Pa. xxvi. good intent would haue taken vpo~ him to burne incense vnto y^e LORDE but Azarias the preste sayd boldely vnto hym, it is not thyne offyce Ozi+as to burne ince~se vnto the LORDE, but it pertayneth to prestes the son+nes of Aaron, which are consecrated to suche ministry  seruyce. He com, maunded him also to go out of y^e san+ctuary,  tolde him y^e that whiche he had done, should not turne vnto his prayse of the LORDE God. And im|mediately

after for his disobedsente presumpcio~, he was stryken w^e lepro+ly,  so beynge cast oute of the house of the Lorde, he contynued a Leper euen vnto his death.
Good inten|tes not grou~+ded on Gods word, are the authore of al euell.The Iewes dyd put Christ  his Apostles to death of a good zele, wyl intent and purpose. The tyrauntes whiche dyd slaye the holy martyres thoughte they dyd well. The bloude soupers also, which at this tyme per+secute Christes gospel vnder y^e name of Heresye,  cruelly slaye  shed the bloude of the true Christians vnder the pretexte of persecutynge Hereti+kes, perswade themselues that they do well,  thynke they meryte great|ly in y^e syght of God,Ioan. xvi. as Christ sayth the tyme shall come that they which kyl you, shal thike y^e they do an high seruyce vnto God.
Whyle we follow our owne wyll, we commyt many absurdities  vn+syttynge thynges. Therfore what+soeuer

we do we must haue a respect to the wyll of God,  make ours con+formable vnto it, vnlesse we hepe vp da~nacion vnto our selues in all our peticions, prayers  requestes. We muste aske accordynge to the wyll of God. He that doth otherwyse, doth euell,  therfore he obtayneth not y^e which he desyreth,Iaco. iiii. as S. Iames say ethe: Ye aske, and haue not, bycause ye aske amysse, for to consume it vp|on youre volupteousnes. If he doth obtayne it, vndoubtedlye it is to his greater damnacio~. Therfore let vs aske accordynge to the wyll of God. So may we be sure to haue our her tes desyre,i. Ioan. v. as S. Iohn~ sayth, This is the trueth that we haue in God, that yf we aske ony thyng according vnto his wyll, he heareth vs. And yf we knowe that he heareth vs, what so euer we aske, we knowe that we shall haue the Peticions that we de|syre of hym. And that we maye do it

fruytfully,Psal. xlii let vs praye w^t the Psal|mograph, teach me O LORDE, to do thy myl, for y^e arte my God. So shal God worke his good pleasure in vs.


The nynetyne Chapter.
We maye appoynte God no tyme.MOreouer although i~ our pray+ers we aske all thynges accor|dyng vnto the wyll of God, yet may not we appoynt God the tyme of ob+taynynge these thynges. We muste praye  aske, but oure peticions we muste referre  commyt to God for to be graunted, whan it shall be hys moost godly pleasure. For he know|eth what is moost fitte for vs better than we do our selues,  he wyll vn|doubtedly graunt vs those thinges that we aske, or elles muche better, wha~ he seeth his tyme.Psal. cxxii Therfore let vs lyft vp our eyes vnto him, which dwellethe in y^e heauens. And as the eyes of seruauntes are euer on the ha~des of theyr maysters,  as y^e eies of the handemayde are all wayes on

the handes of her maystres, so lette our eyes be bent euer vnto y^e LORD, vntyll he hath mercy vpon vs. Let vs aske,  pacie~tly abyde his diuyne wyll,  surely we shall not be decey|ued of our desyres. But yf we shall appoynte hym the tyme,  wyl that he be obedie~t to our wyl, rather tha~ we to his, than do we tempte him,  prouoke his anger agaynst vs. Exa~+ple haue we in y^e History of Judith,Ju. vii, viii. where we read that whan the Isra|elites had ben longe oppressed of No+lofernes  his army,  had contynu|ed manny houres in theyr prayers, cryenge vnto the LORDE for helpe,  yet perceyued none at all at y^e hande of God: They all consented that yf God dyd not helpe the~ wythin fyue dayes, they woulde gyue ouer both the~selues  theyr citie vnto Dolofer+nes  his people. But whan Judith that vertuous woman hearde of it, she sayde: Why haue ye consented to

gyne ouer the citie vnto the Assyria+nes, yf helpe commeth not vnto you from the LORDE within fiue dayes? What are you that thus tempte the LORD? This is not a saye~g for to pro+uoke mercye, but rather to store vp yre,  to kyndle furor. Daue ye ap|poynted y^e tyme of the LORDES mer|cy?  haue ye appoynted hym a daye at youre pleasure? But seynge the LORDE is pacie~t, let vs repent, and be sory for this thynge, and let vs de+syre his sauour w^t wepynge teares.
Thus se we that it is no siale of fence, be our peticions neuer so righ+teous, for to appoynte God y^e tyme. For that appoyntement of tyme de|clareth vs to be vnsaythfull. It she|weth that we haue no ryght perswa+sion of God. It is a manifest argu|ment, that we depende  hange vpo~ Gods goodnes  mercy only for our carnail profytte  auau~tage. It ma|keth euydent, that we do no longer

regarde God, than he satisfieth and fulfylleth our lustes, pleasures, and desyres.Good cou~se Therfore let vs do, that we are co~maunded, that is, hu~blye offer vp our prayers to God, myth all sub+mission of mynde, powre out our her+tes before him,  with vnfayned tea+res lament our cause vnto hym, no|thynge doubtynge, but that accor|dyng to his moost godly promyse he wyll heare vs, grau~t vs those or els better thynges, when it shall be hys plesure. And yf God semeth to with|draw his helpe fro~ vs at any tyme  not streyghtwayes to grau~t vs our requestes, lette vs not dispayre, nor fall from the true confidence, truste  hope in the moost confortable pro|mises of god therfore, but rather be the more earnest  importune in as|kynge, beynge perswaded that God only differeth  prolongeth the ac|complyshme~t of his moost faythfull promyse, bycause he wyll trye oure

fayth, whyther it be right constant, and stedfast or not. Dearly beloued, sayth S. John~ Chrisostome, wha~ I saye, praye vnto God, besech hym,  wayte vpon him, thou sayst: I haue prayed once, twyse,  thryse, yea and ten tymes  twenty tymes,  what haue I receyued, sayst thou? Go not thy way, tyll thou receyuest, for the ende of the thyng asked, is the recey+uynge of hym that prayethe. Than cease thou, whan thou hast receyued yea rather neyther cease y^u than, but stil perceyue  co~tinue, giuig tha~kes for that which thou hast receyued, y^e that which thou hast taken, may co~|tinually remayne with the.
Mat. xv.Let vs followe the woman of Ca+nane, which, as it woulde appeare, beynge denyed of her peticio~ diuers tymes, at the leeste receyuynge but smale co~fort at christes hand, would not cease, but styll continued in ma|kynge suyte  supplicacio~ for y^e helth

of her doughter, tyll at the laste she heard this swete  co~fortable voyce, O woman great is thy fayth. Be it vnto the, as thou wylte.


 The. xx. Chapter.
THe laste of all, which is to be co~|sythered in the preparacion of prayer, is so necessary, that without it, all the other are but vayne,  no|thyng to the purpose: And it is this that wha~ soeuer we entend to pray, we do fyrst forgyue such as haue of|fended vs, or els by no meanes can we obtayne remission of our synnes  fauour at the hand of God. Ther|fore do we on thys manner praye in the Pater noster:Math. vi. Forgyue vs oure dettes, euen as we forgyue our det|ters. And Christ sayth forgyue, and it shall be forgyuen you. Yea he gy|ueth vs a playne co~mau~deme~t y^e we should forgyue so many as haue offe~+ded vs, before we praye, or elles oure prayer worketh vs rather damnaci|on

than saluacio~.Marke. xi. Whan ye prepare your selues to praye, sayeth Christe, forgiue yf ye haue ony thyng agenst ony man, that your father, which is in heaue~, may forgyue you also your trespasses.Math. vi. Agayne he sayth: yf ye for+gyue men theyr faultes, your heaue~+ly father wyl also forgyue you. But yf ye do not forgyue men theyr faul|tes, nether wyll your father forgiue you your faultes.
We reade that Peter came vnto Christ,Mat. xviii.  sayd, LORDE howe ofte shal my brother synne agaynste me, and I shall forgyue hym? Untyll seuen tymes? Christ aunswered, I say not vnto the, vntyl seuen times, but vn+tyll seuenty tymes seue~ tymes. And  Luke he sayth:Luke xvii. Take hede to your selues. If thy brother synneth age~st the, rebuke hym,  yf he repente, for|gyue hym And yf he synneth seuen tymes in a daye agaynste the,  shall seuen tymes in a day turne agayne

vnto the, sayenge: It repenteth me, forgyue hym.Math. xviii And in Mathewe to make the matter more playne, that we shall not be forgyuen of God, ex|cept we forgyue the~ y^e offende vs, he putteth for the a similitude or para|ble of a certayne kynge, which when he called hys seruauntes to a coun|tes, had one brought to hym, which ought hym ten thousande talentes. Whan he was not able to paye, hys Lorde co~maunded hym to be folde,  his wyfe,  his Chyldren,  all that euer he had,  payment to be made. The seruau~t fell downe,  worshyp|ped hym, sayenge: LORDE be pacient toward me,  I wyll paye the all to+gyther. The LORD had pitie on that seruaunt, losoned hym, and forgaue hym all that he ought. But that ser+uaunte goynge forth founde one of his fellow seruauntes, which ought hym an hundred pence, and layenge ha~d on hym,  tahi~g him by y^e throte

he sayde, paye that thou west. Hys fellowe seruaunte fell downe,  desy+red hym, sayenge. Be pacie~t toward me,  I wyll paye the all togyther. He would not, but went his waye,  cast him ito pryson, vntyll he should paye the dette. Dhan his fellow ser|uauntes saw that which was done, they lame~ted verye sore,  came, and openned vnto theyr Lorde all those thynges that were done. Than dyd theyr LORDE call hym,  sayde vnto hym, thou vngracious seruaunt, I forgaue the all that dette, whe~ thou desyredst me, had it not ben conueni+ent also, that y^u shouldest haue had pi+tie on thy fellow seruaunt? And his LORDE beyng angry, co~mytted him to the Ialours, vntyll he should pay all that was due vnto hym. Christe concludethe: So lykewyse shall my heauenly father do vnto you, yf eue+ry one of you euen from y^ very hert doth not forgyue hys brother theyr

offences. Hereof doth it appere more clerely than the lyghte, that excepte we forgyue, we shall neuer be forgy|uen,Prayers done out of charite please not God. neyther can ony thynge please God that we do, yf it be done out of charitie. For the worde of God aby|deth fyrme, sure,  constant for euer+more. And this sayeng of Christ can not be mocked by onye meanes, nor made frustrate, so lykewyse shall my heauenly father do vnto you, yf eue+ry one of you eue~ from y^ very herte dothe not forgyue his brother theyr offences. What S. Paule wrytethe of those workes, which are done out of charite in the fyrste Epistle to the Corinthians, the thyrtene Chapter, it is not vnknowen to them y^e reade the holy scriptures. God louethe no vncharitable, malicious, wycked, en+uious,  bloudy prayers. Euery one that hateth his brother, is a ma~slay+er.i. Joan. iii. And ye knowe sayeth S. John, y^e euery manslayer, hathe not euerla|styng

lyfe abydyng in hym. Agayne If ony man sayeth,i. Ioan. iiii. I loue God, and hatethe his brother, he is a lyer. For he that loueth not hys brother, who~ he hath sere, god, whom he hath not sene, how can he loue? And this com+mau~deme~t haue we of hi~, y^e he, which loueth God, do also loue his brother. But let vs heare what oure golden mouthed Doctor sayeth to this mat+ter.


 The. xxi. Chapter.
Hom. lxxxix De oraione.IF that we be commau~ded not on|ly to pray for the faythfull but al+so for the vnfaythful, consyder thou how great  euell it is to desyre euel agaynst y^e brothers. What dost thou o man Commest thou to God for to make him mercyfull vnto the,  dost thou wysh euel to another? Excepte thou doste forgyue, neyther shall it be forgyuen the. Thou doste not on|ly not forgiue, but thou also desirest God, that he wyll not forgyue If it shall not be forgyuen the, which dost

not forgyue, doste thou not alonlye not forgyue, but also desyrest GOD not to forgyue? If it be not forgyue~ him, that doth not forgiue, how shal it than be forgyuen him, which pray+eth the LORDE, that he maye not for+gyue? If it be a shame to haue enemi+es, consyther thou than, howe great a synne it is to desyre euell to them, whan thou oughteste to pourge thy selfe, bycause thou hast enemies, dost thou also accuse the~? What forgyue+nes shalte thou obtayne, detracting  reportyng euell of thy neyghbour, thefely at such time, when thou hast nede of no meane mercye. For thou ta~mest also to praye for thyne owne synnes.Note well Remeber not therfore other mennes fautes, vnlesse thyne owne be reserued. Thou arte a man, vo|myte not oute the poyson of adders. Thou arte a man, playe not the cru|ell wylde beast. Thou haste a mouth made vnto the for thys cause, not y^e

thou shouldest byte, but that y^ shou dest heale. Reme~ber what God ma|nifestly hath monysshed the to do, e|uen that y^u shouldest spare  forgiue.
De co~u~e. cordi. li. i.Agayne in another place he sayth as concernynge that which is wryt|ten: Forgyue vs oure dettes, as we forgiue our detters, who is he amo~g vs all, that dare boldely saye theyse thynges to God? For althoughe we do no euell to our enemies  detters yet haue we within vs a wounde of offence, that is incurable, and canne not be made whole. But Christ wyll not only that we forgyue them that offendethe vs, but also that we loue them  praye for them. For yf onlye thou dost not hurt hym, which hath hurte the,  yet turneste awaye thy selfe from hym,  wouldest not glad|ly se hym, without doubte ther aby|deth a wounde in thy brest,  sorowe encreaseth styll in thy herte. If it be so, certes that is not fulfilled, which

Christ hath co~mau~ded. Wylte thou that God be mercyfull vnto the o such sorte, that he shoulde not hurte the,  yet turne hym selfe awaye fro~ the,  remember thy synnes,  haue no mynde to se the? Therfore euen such one as thou wouldest that god shoulde be vnto the, whan thou desy+rest forgyuenes of thy synnes, suche one oughtest thou to shewe thy selfe vnto them, whiche haue offended a|gaynst the. As a certeyne wyse man wryteth, saying, he that seaketh ven geaunce, shal fynde vengeaunce of y^ LORDE, which shall surely kepe hym his synnes. Forgyue thy neyghbour the hurte that he hath done the,  so shall thy synnes be forgyuen the al|so whan thou prayeste. A man that bereth hatred agaynst another, how dare he desyre forgyuenes of God He that sheweth no mercy to a man which is lyke hymselfe, howe dare he aske forgyuenes of his synnes? If he

that is but flesshe, beareth hatred,  kepe it, who shall itrete for his ines
Seynge therfore that excepte we do forgyue our detters,De co~pu~ cordi. li. oure dettes shall not be forgyuen of God, and in asmuch as we shall fynde God suche one to vs, as we are to oure neygh|bours, let vs followe Christ  Ste|uen, whiche prayed to God for theyr enemies in the myddes of theyr tor|mentes, that they myghte be forgy|uen. For let vs know this to be true and nothynge more truer, that as a Surgion can not heale perfectely y^ wound so long as any yron is in it, so likewyse can not prayer profyt so longe as the mynde is canchred, and defyled with gyle, fraude, deceyte, si|mulacion, rancoure, hatred, malyce emnite,  suche other wyckednesses. There is nothing, layth Chrisosto that maketh vs more lyke vnto God than yf we be gentle  easy to be in+treated of them that be euel, and d

hurte vs. God is redy to forgyue at al times, yf we forgiue. God maketh his sonne to shyne both vpon y^e good  euell,  sendeth rayne vpon y^e righ+teous  vnryghteous. Let vs ther|fore after the example of our heauen+ly father loue not only our frendes, but also our enemies, yea  that fro~ the bottome of the herte. Let vs for+gyue so many as offende vs,  shew our selues of such affeccion toward them that offende vs, as we desyre y^ Christ should be towarde vs. Lette vs be so feruentely gyuen vnto the preseruacion of fraternall concorde  mutuall charitie, that yf thorowe humayne infirmite it chaunseth at ony tyme that co~tencion ryseth vp amonge vs, we maye notwythstan|dynge so shortely put it away by re|concylynge one to another, that all displeasure taken awaye, the sonne maye not faull downe vpon our an|ger. Let vs euer set before oure eyes

this sayeng of S. Paule As y^ elect of God, holy  beloued, put on te~der mercy, kyndenes, hu~blenes of mynd mekenes,De co~u~ cordi. li. longe sufferynge, forbea|rynge one onother, and forgeuynge one another (yf oe manne haue a quarell to another) as Christe for|gaue you, so do ye. But aboue al thi~+ges put on loue, whiche is the bonde of perfeccion. And the peace of God mought rule in your hertes, vnto y^ whiche peace ye are called in one bo|dy, and se that ye be thanckefull.
If we wyll do thus whan soeuer we praye, we maye be sure to praye wyth fruyte, we maye be sure to ob|tayne what so euer we aske of God the father thorowe Iesus Christ, we maye be sure to haue forgyuenes of all oure synnes,  euer to haue God the father a bounteous and gentle father vnto vs.
Hytherto haue I declared, what prayer is, of what vertue  stre~gth

the true  christen prayer is,  howe we ought to prepare oure selues for to praye.
Now it remayneth that I declare in what place a Christen man should praye,  after what maner. Agayne for what thynges,  at what tyme he ought to praye.



 In what place a Chrysten shoulde Praye.

 The. xxii. Chapter.
_ALthough God in y^ olde lawe was called vpon,  prayed vnto of y^e Iewes in the temple of Ierusa|le~, which Salomo~ buyl|ded,  although God had chose~ that place, wher chefely they shoulde call vpon his name, offer Sacrifyce vn|to hym, read  learne his moost holy law,  do such thynges as he had ap+poynted them in his word, yet both at that tyme, yea  also many yeres

before, we read that dyuers holy me~ prayed in other places besydes that Temple,  were harde. Neyther dyd God so institute that temple to be a house of prayer, as though it should only be there lawefull to call on hys diuyne name,Why the te~|ple of Salo|mo~ was buil+ded. but y^t by that meanes he shoulde kepe the grosse Iewes in an order, whiche els would haue in|ue~ted newe kyndes of worshyppyng God after theyr owne fantasy,  re|sorted to such places, wher Idolles were worshypped,  by this meanes be prouoked vnto Idolatrye, where vnto they were very much bent, as we may se in the holy Scriptures. Therfore god appointed the~ to pray in that temple of Salomon, not ta|kynge awaye yet for all that the ly|bertie of prayeng in euery place fro~ the faythfull.Gene. iiii. For we read y^e Enos y^ sonne of Seth dyd fyrst begynne to call on the name of the LORDE, be|fore ony temple was buylded. And

it is to be thoughte, that Abell also prayed vnto God, whan he offred in crisyce, Enoch, Nohe, Thare, Abra|ham, Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph with ma|ny other of the auncie~t Patriarkes worshypped  prayed vnto God, one in this, another in that place, before ony one peculiar house was appoin|ted  dedicated vnto prayer, yea and God hearde those prayers, accepted them,  graunted the peticions as|ked in them. What other thynge do the examples of all these holye men teach vs, than that it is lawfull for a faythfull man to praye wythoute ony differency in euery place.Exod ii. Dyd not the chyldren of Israell praye to God, wha~ they were oppressed wyth miserable captiuite in Egypt a lond full of Idolatrye, supersticion,  all kynde of wickednes? Dyd not Mo|ses  Aaron many tymes praye vn|to y^e LORDE in wyldernes?Iosue.  Dyd not Iosue praye vnto God in hys wat|res

before, we read that dyuers holy me~ prayed in other places besydes that Temple,  were harde. Neyther dyd God so institute that temple to be a house of prayer, as though it should only be there lawefull to call on hys diuyne name,Why the te~+ple of Salo|mo~ was buil+ded. but y^t by that meanes he shoulde kepe the grosse Iewes in an order, whiche els would haue in|ue~ted newe kyndes of worshyppyng God after theyr owne fantasy,  re|sorted to such places, wher Idolles were worshypped,  by this meanes be prouoked vnto Idolatrye, where vnto they were very much bent, as we may se in the holy Scriptures. Therfore god appointed the~ to pray in that temple of Salomon, not ta|kynge awaye yet for all that the ly|bertie of prayeng in euery place fro~ the faythfull.Gene. iiii. For we read y^t Enos y^e sonne of Seth dyd fyrst begynne to call on the name of the LORDE, be|fore ony temple was buylded. And

it is to be thoughte, that Abell also prayed vnto God, whan he offred sa+crifyce, Enoch, Nohe, Thare, Abra|ham, Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph with ma|ny other of the auncie~t Patriarkes worshypped  prayed vnto God, one in this, another in that place, before ony one peculiar house was appoin|ted  dedicated vnto prayer, yea and God hearde those prayers, accepted them,  graunted the peticions as|ked in them. What other thynge do the examples of all these holye men teach vs, than that it is lawfull for a faythfull man to praye wythoute ony differency in euery place.Exod ii. Dyd not the chyldren of Israell praye to God, wha~ they were oppressed wyth miserable captiuite in Egypt a lond+full of Idolatrye, supersticion,  all kynde of wickednes? Dyd not Mo|ses  Aaron many tymes praye vn|to y^e LORDE in wyldernes?Iosue.  Dyd not Iosue praye vnto God in hys war|res,

whan he made the Sonne and Moone to stand styll, vntyll he had reuenged hymselfe of hys enemyes?. Reg. xvii. Dyd not Helias praye in the house of the wydowe of Sarepra, wha~ he restored her so~ne from death to syfe? Dyd not he agayne pray in y^e toppe of the mounte Carmelus,  obtay|ned after long droute ple~te of rayn?. Reg. . Esaie. xii. Dyd not Ezechias the kynge whan he heard that he should dye, pray to the LORDE in his bed,  obtayned to lyue.Nehem.  xv. yeres longer? Dyd not Ne|hemias but lare vnto kyng Artaxer+zes both do seruyce vnto his Lorde,  also pray vnto God?Toby. viii. Dyd not To|by  Sara his wyfe pray vnto God in theyr houses?

Dyd not Daniel, when he serued the wycked kynge knele downe  pray vnto the LORDE thryse euery daye in his cha~|ber?

Dyd not he praye to God,Dani. xi. wha~ he was cast into the denne of Lyo~s? Dyd not Ionas pray in the whales belly?Ionas. ii. Hester. xiiii.

Dyd not Corne+lius the Centurion pray at home in his house? Dyd not Peter praye in the ouer parte of the house of Sy|mon the Ca~ner?Actum. xxi. Dyd not Paule w^t his co~panyons praye in dyuers pla|ces,

as cities, townes, felde s, see ba~c+kes, shyppes, prysons. c? Were not all these heard? yes verely,  theyr pe+ticions graunted them mercifully. What do we learne of all these Histo+ries? Certes that a faythfull christi|an is bou~d to no place. Wher soeuer a faithful ma~ prayeth, he shal vndou+tedly beheard. Christ sayd to the wo+ma~ of Samaria:Ioan. iiii. Woma~ beleue me, y^e houre co~meth, wha~ neither in this mountayne, nor at Ierusale~ ye shall worshyp the Father. Ye worshyp ye knowe not what. We worshyp that we knowe. For helth is of the Iues. But the houre co~meth,  nowe it is, wha~ true worshyppers shall worship the father in spiryte  trueth. For y^e father also seketh suche y^e maye wor|shyp hym. For God is a spiryte, and they that worshyp hym, muste wor|shyp him in spirite  trueth. Saynt Paule also sayth,i. Tim. ii. I wyll that men praye in euery place, lyftynge vppe|pure

handes wythout wrath  con|te~cion. But let vs heare what Chri|sostome sayth.


 The. xxiii. Chapter.
LEt vs not excuse our selues say+enge,Home. lxxxix de oratione. that it is no easye thynge for a man beynge enta~gled w^t world+ly businesses to praye, seynge that he hath no oratory nor house fytte for prayer nygh vnto hym. For wher so euer thou be, thou mayst make and appoynt thyne altare. For the place hyndereth nothynge, neyther dothe the tyme let, but though thou doste not bowe thy knees, nor knocke thy brest, nor stretche out thy handes to heauen, yet mayst thou pray aright  make thy prayer perfecte, so that thou only shewest  bryngest forth a ferue~t mynde. For thou mayst wha~ thou goest vnto markette,  walkest by thy selfe alone, make longe pray|ers. Thou mayst also syttynge i~ thy shoppe,  sowynge skynnes dedicate

thy soule vnto the LORDE. The ser|uaunt also that byeth, or goeth vp  downe,  the Cooke doyng his office whan he can not go to chyrche, may make a prayer longe  discrete. For God disdaineth not the place, but re+quyreth one thynge, that is to saye, a feruent mynde,  a pure soule. For Paule also, not in an Oratory, but in the prison lyenge wyde open, nor stondynge ryghte vp, nor bowynge his knees, for the clogge, wherwyth his feete were bound, dyd not suffer hym, yet seynge that he lyenge pray|ed feruently, he shaked the prysonne vnlosoned the foundacions,  dydde bynd the keper of the pryson,  after+ward brought hym vnto holy religi+on. And Ezechias not sto~ding right vp, nor bowynge hys knees, but ly|eng wyde open in his bedde bycause of his syckenes, wha~ he turned hym+selfe vnto the wall, in asmuche as he called vpon God feruently  wyth a

pure soule, he both called agayne the sentence pronou~ced, obtayned much beneuolence,  was restored to hys olde helth. And the these beyng stret+ched out vpon the crosse, wyth fewe wordes purchased the heaue~ly kyng+dome. And Ieremy in the myre and lake,  Daniel in the prysone and a|monge the wylde beastes. And Io|nas in the belly of a whale, prayeng vnto God, dyd both dissolue all ma|ner of euels, wherwith they were be+seged, co~passed  set about, and also found fauoure at the hande of God, what than oughteste thou to saye, when thou prayest? Uerely euen the same thynge that the woman of Ca+nane dyd. For eue~ as she sayd. Haue meroye on me, my doughter is gre|uously vexed of a dyuell, so say thou lykewyse, haue mercye vpon me, my soule is very greuously vexed of a di+uell. For synne is a great dyuell, she y^ had the dyuell dyd fynde mercy, 

yet was she hated; wha~ she dyd syn? Haue mercy on me, is but a short sai+enge, yet doth it contayns an whole see of mercy. For wher soeuer mercy is, ther are all good thi~ges. Though thou be without the chyrch, cry, say+eng, haue mercy on me though thou dost not moue thy lyppes, but onlye crye in thy mynde. For God also hea+reth them that holde theyr peace. Ther is no place to be sought, but a begynnyng of a place. Ieremy was in the myre,  he made God bounte|ous vnto hym by prayer. Iob was on y^e dunge hyll,  he made God mer+cyfull vnto hym. Ionas was in the whales bellye,  he had God gentle to hym. Though thou be in a vayne praye. Wher so euer thou be, praye. Thou arte the temple, seke no place. The see was before the Iewes, and the Egipcians behynd at theyr bac|kes,  Moses in the myddes speking nothynge, for he was greatlye trou|bled

in his prayer, yet sayd God vn|to hym, what cryest thou to me? In lyke maner thou therfore, whan soe|uer temptacion shal come vpon the, flye vnto God,  call on the LORDE. Is he a ma~, that thou shouldest seke after a place? God is euer at hande. For thou yet spekynge, he wyll say: Beholde here I am presente. Thou hast not yet made thy praier, and he bryngethe helpe. For yf thou haste a mynde pure from vncleane mocio~s, though thou be in the market, or in way, or in the consystory, or in y^e see, or in the ynne, or in the shyppe, or in onye other place of the worlde, loke where so euer thou calleste on God, there mayest y^u obtayne thy peticio~.
Hytherto haue I rehersed y^e wor+des of S. John Chrisostome.De bet a in+nocen. cap. cccxiii. Lyke vnto this wryteth Sayncte Auste~, sayenge: Why dost y^u seke for a fytte and holy place, whan thou shouldest make thy supplicacio~ to God? make

cleane thy inward partes,  all eue lustes expulsed from thence, prepare thy selfe a secrete place in the peace of thy herte. Thou wyllyng to pray in the temple, praye in thy selfe, and so behaue thy selfe alway that thou mayste be the te~ple of God. For God heareth there, where he dwelleth.
Thus sewe both by the authory|te of the holy scriptures,  the aunci+ent fathers, that a faythfull  Chry|sten man may praye lawfully in eue+ry place,1. Cor. iii. . vi 11. Cor. vi. in asmuch as he is the tem|ple of God, as S. Paule sayeth: Do ye not knowe that ye are the Te~ple of God,  the spiryte of God dwelleth in you? The Temple of God is holy which you are.Math. vi. And this is it y^e christ sayth: Whan thou shalt praye, enter into thy closette,  the dore sparred, praye to thy father, whiche is in se|crete. Therfore let hym y^e shall pray, nothynge feare to praye vnto God in euery place boldly, wyth this per|swasion

y^ God wil heare hi~,  grafit hi~ his hertes desyre i what soeuer place he be.


 The xxiiii. Chapter.
I Haue not spoke~ these thynges to make ony pso~ for to haue y^e lesse de+uocion to go vnto the Chyrche  ac|customed place of prayer,Slaunder not ye syco phantes. when time requyeth (whiche thynge God for|byd that anye man contrary to my meanyng should gather of these my wordes, or thereby be occasioned the lesse to obserue and kepe the com|mendable order of thys Realme nowe a dayes vsed among vs) but to shewe that a faythefull Chrysten man maye lawefullye by Goddes worde praye in euery place, w^t thys perswasio~ y^e God wyl also heare him in euery place,Mat. xxi. Marc. xi. Luk. xix. yea  that whan soe|uer he prayeth, so that his prayer be made accordynge vnto the wyll of god,  as I haue taught heretofore. For we reade that Christ at dyuers tymes dyd so approue  allowe the

temple of Ierusalem,Ioan. ii. Esa. lvi. Iere. vii. that of the ve|ry same place he rehearsed this text of the holy scripture, my house shall be called the house of prayer. Agayn he droue out with whyppes such as dyd bye  sell in the te~ple, declaryng thereby, that it was a place of more holines,  of greater pryce in y^e sight of God, than that ony prophane bu|sinesses myght lawfullye be in it ex|ercysed. He also many tymes prea|ched in the Temple,  it is not to be doubted but that he also vsed there to praye. Agayne, we reade that the Apostles after Christes ascension re+pared thyther oftentymes bothe to preach  praye.Act. iii. Places therfore dedi+cated to prayer ought not to be des|pysed nor abhorred, but vsed vnto y^e end for y^e which they were instituted
Mat. xviiiChrist sayth, wher soeuer two or thre shalbe gathered togyther in my name, there am I in the myddes of them. Nowe in Chyrches it is to be

thought that many are gathered to+gyther in Christes name, therfore is Christ there amonge them. Seyng that he is so, euery man ought ioye|fully to repare thyther, whan they maye conueniently, but chefely whe~ the tyme  publyque order doth re|quire,  ther both faithfully to pray deuoutly to be present at y^e ministra+cio~ of the moost blessed Sacrament of the altare Christes very body and bloud,  dilygently to read or heare the worde of God,  furthermore to do such thinges, as the place  tyme shall than requyre. At all other ty|mes whan so euer a christen ma~ shal be desposed to praye, let hym praye boldely, and althoughe he be not in the chyrche, yette let hym nothynge doute, but that his prayer shall ther also be hearde and graunted.



 After what maner a chry|sten man ought to pray.


 The .xxv. Chapter.
_NOwe it remaynethe to declare after what man+ner a Christe~ ma~ ought to pray. In the declara|ion hereof it shall be ne+cessary, that he whiche wyll praye a|ryght, doth fyrst co~syder what he is to whome he muste praye.Who it is vnto who~ we praye. Agayne, what he hym selfe is that prayethe. It is no man nor Aungel, but God which is prayed vnto, whome the an+gelike potestates do reuere~tly feare, whom all the whole company of hea+uen do magnify, commende, prayse, worshyp  honour,Iacob. ii. Phil. ii. whom the diuels do feare, tremble  shake for dreade, in whose name euerye knee bothe of thynges in Heauen, of thynges in earth,  of thynges vnder the earth do bowe, whiche is of puyssaunt po|wer i holynes terrible,Exo. xv. Deut. iiii. Heb. xiii. al prayse wor+thy,  doynge meruaylous thynges which is a consumynge fyre, whiche

is a great LORDE aboue all y^e Gods,ii. Pat. ii. ester. xiii. Iob. xxxvi. Iere. xxxii. Exo. xxxiiii. which is the LORDE of all thinges,  no man can resyst his maieste, which is great in strength, iudgement and ryghteousnes, whose eyes are open vpon all the wayes of the sonnes of Adam,  in whose syght no creature is innocent.
Whan he hath on this manner co~+sidered of God, than must he ponder what hym selfe is, euen a very mise|rable si~ner,What he is, that prayer destitute of all goodnes, voyde of all godlynes,  vnworthye to approche vnto the throne of y^e di|uyne maiesty. For this humiliacion of our selues helpeth greatly to the auau~cement of our prayer. For the more that ony man deiecteth  thro+weth downe himselfe, the nerer is he made vnto God.Luk. xviii. The Pharise was farre of from god, although he stode nexte vnto the Propiciatory, reme~|brynge his good dedes,  despisynge other men in co~parison of hymselfe.

The Publicane, which stondynge a farre of prayed, came nygher vnto God. For the LORDE is hyghe,  yet doth he beholde humble thynges, he knoweth high thynges a farre of, he despyseth the hawty,  loketh on the prayer of y^e hu~ble,  the prayer of the~ doth not he despyse. Wylte y^ heare, howe hygh a thynge the prayer of a man, whiche humbleth hymselfe, is? The wyse man teacheth this thyng sayenge:Eccl xxxv. The prayer of hym that hu~+bleth hymselfe, shall pearse  go tho|rowe the cloudes,  tyll it draweth nyghe, it shall not be conforted, and it shall not comme downe vntyll the moost hyghest doth looke vpon it.
This humilitie do we reade to be much vsed amonge holy men,Dan. ix. in ty|mes past. Daniel prayed on this ma~+ner, not in our owne ryghteousnes|ses O LORDE do we powre oute oure prayers before the, but in thy great mercyes. Heare vs, O LORD, LORDE

be mercifull vnto vs. Heare vs, and do these thynges that we aske, yea  that for thyne owne sake.Baruc. ii. Also Ba|ruch, the soule, sayth he, that is ber|ed for the multytude of her synnes, which goeth on heuely and wekely, whose eyes begynne to fayle, surely such a soule ascrybeth prayse, glory  ryhhteousnes vnto the O LORDE. Not for the ryghteousnes of our fa|thers do we powre out our prayers in thy syght,  aske mercy before thy face, O LORDE our God, but bycause thou arte mercyfull. Haue therfore mercy on vs, for we haue synned be|fore the.
This co~sideracion once had both of god  of hymselfe, wherby he hath learned God to be ryghteous, hym|selfe vnryghteous, God to be good, hymself euel, God to be holy, himself prophane. God to be honorable, hym selfe miserable, God to be pure, hym selfe vnpure, God to be immaculate

hymselfe spotted wyth all kynde of synne, God to be hyghe,  nothynge more hygh,Meanes to prouoke y^e mercy of God to|ward hym y^ shal pray hymselfe to be vyle,  no+thynge more vyle: than must he be|fore his praier vse some menes wher+by, he maye excyte  stoore vp the be|neuolence and good wyll of God to|warde hym,  so adourne  garnysh hymselfe with ghostlye operacion, y^e both he  his prayer maye be y^e more acceptable in the syght of God.An exam|ple. For who dare co~e vnto a Kynges or Em+peroures presence for to desyre onye thynge of them, excepte fyrste of all he so composeth hymselfe, y^t nothing maye offend theyr eyes? He putteth on clenly apparell, he kymbethe his head, he wassheth his body, yea  al|so perchaunse annoynteth it, and so appoynteth hymselfe in euery condi+cion, that nothynge maye displease them, but rather allure them to the syght of hym,  the hearynge of hys peticion. Semblablye it shalbe con+uenient

for hym that wyll pray vn|to God with fruyte,  hath truly w^t hym selfe consydered the highnes of god,  the humblenes of hymselfe, to gyue diligence that he on such sorte co~poseth hymselfe, that there be no|thyng in hym that may offe~d y^e eyes of god but y^e his praier may be fauou+rably accepted  graciously hearde. And that this thynge maye come to passe, it shal be necessary that he fol|loweth the aunciente  holy fathers in tymes paste, which whan they of|fered theyr prayers vnto god. Used continually both to faste  gyue al|mes. For as Thoby sayth,Toby. xii. prayer is good with fastynge  almes, better than to hyde vp treasures of golde. For almes doth delyuer from death,  it is that whiche purgeth synnes.


 The .xxvi. Chapter.
FYrst as concernyng fastyng,Behold of what occa|sion fastyng we must know that it ought to pro|cede from a contryte, hu~ble,  sorow+full

harte,ought to ryse, and what it is to taste.  from such a soule as ta+keth displesure with it selfe that she hath ben no more circu~specte in the acco~plysshment of Gods wyll, for y^ which she beynge sory  dolorous, ca+steth awaye the delectation and plea+sure of worldely thynges, as eating, drynkynge, banckettyng, wearynge of gorgious apparell, with all other mundane vanities,  streyghtwaye with al humilite of mynde  submis+sion of herte approchethe by syncer fayth  true repentaunce vnto the moost glorious throne of almyghty God,  there lamenteth her misera|ble state, bewayleth her to much syn+full condicion, powreth oute the se|cretes of her herte, desyreth remissi|on of her synnes, hungre the  thyr|stethe for strengthe to do the wyll of God. This kynde of fastyng accom|panyeng prayer doth very much ele+uate, extoll,  lyfte vp the prayer of the humble synner vnto the prese~ce

of GOD And this is it that Tobye sayth,Toby. xii. prayer is good wyth fastyng.
We read that whan Ionas at the co~maundement of God came vnto y^ Niniuites,Ionas. ii.iii. preached vnto the~, rebu|ked theyr synfull lyuynge, threate|ned them subuersion, destruccion,  the vtter decaye both of themselues  of theyr citie,Note and followe. they consternated w^t the reuolucio~ of theyr iniquitie dyd streyghtewayes deteste  abhorre so greatly theyr abhominable lyuyng, y^ they vtterlye layde asyde all theyr vayne pleasures, wherein so much be+fore they delighted,  fell immediate+ly vnto fastynge  prayer with such other godly exercises of the spyryte, so that by thys meanes God behol|dynge theyr true  vnfayned co~uer|sion had pytie on them, saued them,  receyued the~ into the no~ber of hys welbeloued people.iiii. Eso. v. Esdras also at di+uers tymes dyd both faste  pray se|uen dayes togyther, y^t he myght vn|derstond

the hygh misteries of God. We haue fasted,i. Esd. viii. sayethe he,  prayed vnto the LORDE for a fortunate and quiet iourney,  it hath chafised vn+to vs prosperously.ii. Reg. xii. Agayne Dauid for the lyfe of his chylde, which was sycke, dyd both faste  praye a longe season,  woulde eate no meate nor dryncke. I haue prayde sayth Dani+el, to the LORDE my God in fastyng,Dan. ix. sackeclothe,  asshes. Iudith also fa|sted  prayed the moost parte of her lyfe in the vppermooste parte of her house,Iud. viii.  before she slew Holofernes, she many tymes fasted and prayed. Moreouer Quene Hester for the de|lyuerance of her people dyd fast and praye thre dayes  thre nyghtes,He. iiii. be|fore she went vnto the kynge. Sara the doughter of Raguel dyd faste  pray thre dayes  thre nightes, that she myghte be delyuered from a cer|taine impropery and rebuke.Toby. iii. Paule before he was baptysed dyd co~tinue

in prayer  fastynge at the Cytie of Damascum thre dayes  thre nygh+tes.Act. ix. Luk. ii. Luke also in his gospel sheweth howe that a certayne woman called Anna the doughter of Phanuel be|ynge a Prophetysse went for y^e moost parte neuer oute of the Temple, but gaue her mynde to fastyng  prayer both nyght  daye.Mat. ix. Agayne Christe sayth, this kynde of dyuelles is not aste oute but by prayer  fastynge. And it is not to be douted,Mat. iiii. but that Christe hymselfe, whan he fasted the forty dayes  forty nyghtes, dyd al|so praye vnto God his father, as at many other times. The same also is to be thoughte of the Apostles and other holy men.
Thus se we how necessary a thi~ge t is to ioyne fasting w^t prayer, Ther+fore sayethe Peter: Pet. iiii. Be ye sober, and watch in prayer. Also S. Paule, let vs walke honestly as in the day, not in excesse of eatynge  dronckennes,

not in chambrynge  wantonnesse,Rom. xiii. not in stryfe  enuyenge, but put  on the LORDE Iesus Christ,  make not prouysion for the fleshe to fulfyll the lustes of it.Hom. xv. super illud Mat. vi. Cum ieru|natio. Hereto pertayneth the sayenge of oure golden mouthed Doctor S. Iohn~ Chrisostom, fastig sayeth he, is an helpe to prayer. For prayer without fastynge, is but gra cyle, slender  weake. The prayer is valeaunt  stronge, whiche is made in an humble spirite and a troubled hert, as the Prophet sayth, a Sacri+fyce to God is a troubled spiryte, a contryte  humbled herte God wyll not despyse.Psal. i. But an humble spyryte and contryte herte can he not haue, whiche eateth  dryncketh,  setteth all his mynde on delicious fare. For bread maketh stronge the herte, and wyne maketh it mery. The strength that commeth of bread suffreth not the spiryte of the flesh to be humble,  the merines that co~meth of wyne,

dothe not suffer the herte to be con|rite. Therfore whe~ soeuer the holy menne would praye to obtayne ony thyng of God wherof they had nede, they euer ioyned fastyng with pray|er, as Daniel  other dyd. And in as much as fastyng is y^e vertue of pray+er, therfore are they neuer seperated a sunder, but are euer put togyther. Prayer is good with fastyng.Cob. xii. Mat. ix. Agen, This kynd of dyuels is not cast out but by prayer  fastynge. Therfore as a Souldioure is nothynge with oute armoures, nor armoures with+oute a Souldioure, so is prayer no|thyng without fastyng, nor fastyng withoute prayer. Hyther to haue I rehersed y^e wordes of S. Iohn Chri|sostome, wherof we maye easelye ga|ther howe necessary fastyng is vnto the auauncemente of prayer before God.Ser. de Ie+iu et Cent. Christi. Here to pertayneth the sayeng of saynt Cipriane, prayer is mighty in operacion, so that fastynge goeth

before. To be brefe concernyng this matter, fastynge muste nedes make hyghly to the auau~cement of praier seyng y^t he which fasteth aright, co~t meth worldly thinges,Note what it is to fast a ryghte despiseth plea+sure, hateth rytches, abhorrethe th workes of the flesshe, mortifyeth car+nall affectes,  is vtterly giuen, fyx|ed  bent to the fruytes of y^e spirite. Therfore he that entendeth to pray with fruyte, shall not a lytle anaice  set forwarde his prayer, yf on this manner he applyeth hymselfe for to praye.


 The .xxvii. Chapter.
Of AlmesMOreouer as this kynde of fa|stynge dothe very muche pro|moue a christen mans prayer,  ma|keth it greatly to be accepted in the syght of God, so doth almes and the glad distribucion of worldly goodes vpon the poore me~bers of Christ in lyke manner garnysh, adourne, and make very pleasaunt the hu~ble sup|cacion

of a synner in the eyes of the diuine maiesty, as we read of Corne+lius, to whome the aungell sayd, thy prayers  thyne Almesses are come vp into remembraunce before God.Act. x. Behold howe he ioyneth prayer and almes togyther. Toby in lyke man|ner sayeth,Tob. xii. Prayer is good with fa|styng  almes. Lo, here is combyned  ioyned togyther prayer, fastynge,  almes, as thynges necessarye con|curren. The wyse man also sayth,Eccl. vii. to praye and gyue almes, despyse not. Blessed is he,Psal. xi. sayth Dauid, that con+sydereth the nedy  poore, the LORD shall delyuer hym in the daye of hys trouble. Christe also sayth: Gyue ye almes,Luk. xii.  behold al thynges are clene vnto you. Nyther to pertayneth the ayenge of Chrisostome,Hom. xv. in cap. vi. Math. It is wryt|en, sayth he, in the lawe: Enter not nto the syghte of y^ LORDE thy God oyd or empty. Uerely he entreth in mpty before God, which commyng

vnto prayer,Math. this wel. doth no almes. Agayne he sayeth, he prepareth his soule be|fore prayer, whiche doynge almes co~+meth vnto prayer, For as oyle dothe kyndle the lyght of a lampe, so dothe good workes excite  store vp y^ faith of the herte,  gyue boldenes to pray vnto God.
An obiec|cion.But it wyll perchaunce be obiec|ted, eueryeone can not gyue almes, for they wante substaunce, shall not they therfore praye  be heard? I an+swere, as by fastynge,The aun|swere. I do not only vnderstond the abstine~ce from mea|tes  drynckes, but also the mortifi|cacion of carnall affectes,  the con|tempte of mundane pleasures (with+out the which the externall and out+warde fastynge is nothynge els thi diabolicall Hypocrisye and wycked dissimulacion) so lykewyse by almes I meane not only the benificence to+warde the indigent,Note here of fastyng and almes poore and nedy, which without doubte is a singuler

and muche prayse worthy worke be|fore God, but also the desyre of hea|ue~ly thinges,  a wyl vtterly estrau~+ged from all carnall concupiscences  fleshly lustes. So that he which en+tendeth to praye with fruyte, yf he can not do the one, yet oughte he to do the other of necessite,  to be enfla+med with the desyre of thynges cele|stiall, that he maye saye with y^ Psal+mographe,Psal. xii. as the herte desyreth to y^ fountaynes of waters, so dothe my soule desyre vnto the O God. My soule is a thyrst for God that liuing fountayne, wha~ shall I come to ap|peare before the face of God? Agayn O how amiable are thy dwellynges thou LORDE of hostes,Psa. lxxxiii. my soule hath a desyre and longyng for the courte of the LORDE. My herte  my flesshe reioyce in the lyuyng God.Phil. i. This he|uenlye mynde was in S. Paule ly|uynge here in this worlde, whan he sayde, I desyre to be losoned oute of

this mortall body,  to be w^t Christ.Fastyng  almes are Y^ two wyn+ges of prayer. Seynge therfore that fastynge and almes are so necessary to the promo+cion and furthera~ce, to the eleuacio~ and lyftynge vp of prayer,  are cal|led of certayne holy Doctors y^e two wynges of prayer, in asmuche as y them prayer flieth vp vnto y^e throne of the diuyne maieste,  is the better accepted in Gods presence, it shal be expedient for hym that ente~deth to praye with fruite, to exercyse hselfe somewhat before in fastynge and al|mes, on such manner as I haue tau+ghte heretofore. So shall it come to passe, that God shall the more tha~ke fully accepte his prayer, and graunt him his hertes desyre. Not onlye the exercise of these two vertues, but al+so of all oher, shall be necessarye for him that prayeth, that he maye pro+uoke GOD the more bnygnely to heare him. These thinges once done than let him praye, but after what

ma~ner I wyl expresse i~ few wordes.


 The. xxviii. Chapter.
FYrste aboue all thinges,The herte must be see on y^e praye let him gyue earneste diligence y^e whyle he prayeth, his herte maye be sery|ously assyxed and set on his prayer, or els he prayeth in vaine, according to this olde senience. Dum cor non orat, in uanum lingua laborat. That is to saye, whyle the herte doth not praye, the tonge laboureth in vayne.Esa. xxix. Christ al|so sayth, this people honoreth me w^e theyr lyppes, but theyr hert is farre from me Uerely they worship me in vayne For what great absurdite is this,Mat. xv. to desyre god to heare our pray els, and we oure selues do not heare the~: What a kynd of prayeng is this to babble with our lyppes,Note. to ropo~t with our throtes, piteously to shake oure heade, to sytte bare headed, to knele on the bare ground, to knocke our brestes,  yet to haue our mynd troubled  occupied about fyithye 

vncleane thynges? Is this a man|ner of prayenge to make God the fa|ther mercyfull to vs? Yea it rather excite the and storethe vp his anger towarde vs.A poynte for your learnynge S. Austen feareth not to wryte on this manner, as y^e voice of a man w^tout modulacion or swete armony, is as the voyce of syne or hogges, so is prayer withoute deuo|cion as the bellowynge of Oxes. There are two verses publysshed in the name S. Ierome, which seynge they are godly, and teache the true manner of prayenge, I thynke it co~+uenient to alleage the~ in this place.
No~ uox sed uotu~, no~ cordula musica sed cor.
Non clamans sed amans cantat in aure Der,
That is to saye, not the voyce but y^e desyre, not the musicall instrument, but the herte, Not the cryer but the louer sigeth i~ y^e eare of God. Chriso. also wryteth on this maner: It is y^e duty of a deuout mynd to praye to God, not with the voyce or with the

sound of the voyce,Hom. xiiiii. D Ioan. et Paule. Feo. but with the de|uocion of the mynde,  wyth y^e sayth of the herte, Agayne he sayth, thecri+enge of the voice is not the worke in prayer vnto God, whome we knowe y^e he beholdeth the secretes of y^e hert, but the cryeng of fayth,  y^e deuocio~ of a religious  godlymi~d, therfore y^e best way to pray is to pray w^e y^e hert mynde, spiryte, soule,  inward ma~.
Nowe it wyll be demaunded, Demau~dg whi+ther a christen man oughte to praye with an ope~ voyce or not. Although I haue spoken sufficie~tly co~cernyng this matter in the diffinicio~ of pray|er, yet I wyll here adde thre wordes as they saye,Note whan we may law+fully pray   voyce. touchynge this thynge also. Althoughe prayer be the worke of the spiryte, and not of the voyce, of the herte and not of the lyppes, of the mynde and not of the mouth, yet is not the externall sound of the voyce to be condemned, whyther it be in readynge or syngynge, so that it followeth the affeccion of y^e mynd,

and doth seruyce vnto that. For se|inge the glory of God ought to shine after a certayne ma~ner in all y^e par|tes of our body,Why she tonge was made. it is co~uenient that the tonge chefely be addicte  giuen to this ministry and seruyce both in syngynge and speakyng, which was chefely made to declare and preache the magnificence, laude  prayse of God. Therfore so that the tong and the herte do consent and agre togy|ther, beyng alyke occupied in the ef|fusio~ of the prayer, it is not only tol+lerable, but also co~mendable to pray both with tonge and herte.
Of exter|nall gestu|res.Nowe as co~cernyng the externall gesture in praye~ge, as knelyng, knoc+kyng on the brest, lyftynge vp of the handes. c. in asmuch as they be in|different,  we reade that they were vsed of Christ  many holy men in ti+mes past, they are not to be despised. Nothynge is vnsyttynge that pro|cedeth from the seruent affeccion of

the mynd. But I haue spoke~ of this thynge also before in the diffinicion of prayer. Therfore wyll I haste to these thinges that remaine, as more necessary to be intreated of.



 For what thynges we ought to praye.

 The. xxix. Chapter.
_FOr asmuche as we are so ignorant  blynde of oureselues y^e we knowe not what we shoulde de|syre,Rom. viii. as we ought, vnles we shoulde aske ony thynge vnsyt|tynge,  otherwyse than becommeth vs, or that shoulde not be acceptable to God, our sauiour Christ wyilyng in this behalfe to succour our neces|site,Mat. vi.  to helpe our ignora~cy  blynd+nes, hath appoynted  set forth as it were in a certaine table the true ma~+ner of prarenge in the Pater noster, wher he hath co~pendiously declared

for what thynges we ought to pray eyther pertaynynge to the glorye of God, or to the profitte of so many as professe his moost holy name. And al+though euery daye and euery houre doth offer to vs occasions sufficient|ly for to praye vnto God, yea  that for innumerable causes, yet it maye seme that Christ i that prayer which he taught his disciples, hath in sewe wordes comprehended whatsoeuer we haue nede to praye for.The glory of God oughte we to seaket our pray|ers chefely Therfore who soeuer at any tyme shal be myn+ded to praye, let hym aboue all thyn+ges seke the auauncement of Gods glory in his prayer. For the fyrst pe|ticion of the Pater noster, with the nexte two that followe, pertayne on+ly to the glory of GOD, wherin we aske that the name of God maye be sanctified, y^e his kingdo~e may reigne amonge vs, that his wyll maye be done here in earthe as it is in heaue~. So lykewyse dyd Christe a lytle be|fore

his passion,Ioan. xii. pray, sayeng: O fa+ther glorify thy name. Goddes glory therfore ought we to seke aboue all thinges in our prayers at al tymes
After that we haue sought y^e glo+ry of God,Secondly for our sou+les health. place requireth that then we should aske those thynges, which pertaine vnto the euerlasting helth  saluacion of oure soules. For the helth of our soules oughte to be desy+red before the welthe of our body, as Christ monyssheth, fyrst seke y^e kinge+dome of God and the righteousnesse therof.Mat vi. And all these thynges (he spe+keth of meate, dryncke  clothe) shall be caste vnto you. Dauid also sayth one thyng haue I desyred of y^e LORD whiche I wyll require,Psal. xxvi namely that I maye dwell in y^e house of y^e LORDE all the dayes of my lyfe.
And in asmuch as the syncer pre+chyngeChyrel or y^e promo+cion of gods worde. of Gods word helpeth much vnto the saluacion of our soules (for the Gospell of Christ is the power of

God vnto saluacion for euery one y^e beleueth,Rom. 1. Deut viii. Mat. iiii. Rom. x.  a ma~ shall not lyue with bred alone, but with euery worde y^e commeth out of the mouth of God, for fayth commeth by earyng, and hearynge by y^ worde of God) it shal be necessarye for vs to praye y^e Gods worde maye haue fre passage among vs,  that all wicked doctrine, super+sticious teachynge, heresy, strall opinions, sictes  all that euer is co~+trary to wholsome doctryne, maye be exiled  banisshed out of Christes chyrch. Praye for those thynges, sal eth Dauid,Psal. xxi. that make vnto y^e peace of Ierusalem, that is, vnto the safe, quiet, lucky,  prosperous preserua|cion of Christes chyrch, that the do|ctryne of the gospel, which bryngeth peace  quietnes to the hertes of the faythfull, maye triu~phantly reygne amonge vs.Luk. i. Forthly for the mini|sters of Gods worde. But in asmuch as this Euangelion and glad tydynges of christ ca~ neuer be ministred to y^e chri|sten

congregacion withoute syncer  true preachers of the worde, ther|fore oughte e also praye, y^e at Ante christes, Papistes, Heretikes, Schis+matyckes,  sedicious praters sub|moued  put asyde, true Euangely|stes,Rom. xi faythefull Prophetes,  syncr Preachers, maye reygne among vs vniuersallye. For howe shall they preach,mat. ix. except they be sent. Therfore sayth Christ, praye vnto the LORDE of y^e Heruest, that he may shoreforth workemen into his Heruest.
Moreouer seynge that we haue uot only a soule but also a body,Fytely for  magistrates o y^e publique weale. and God hathe appoynted ministers for them hath, it shall alio be conuenie~t accordyng to the admonicion of S. Paule, to praye for the magistrates of y^e publique weale, as for our most edoubted  moost excellent kynge,  for all other that are in authoritie, that we maye lead a peasable  qui|et lyfe, vnder theyr dominion wyth

all godlynes and honestye.1. Eim. ii. Syrtely for corpo|rall thyn+ges.After these thynges it shal not be vnsyttynge to praye for thynges ne+cessary for our body, as meate, drike cloth, fre~dshyp, helth, wisdom, know+ledge, reason. c. yet in the requeste of al these thi~ges aforesayd, we must referre the matter whollye vnto the wyll of God,  be co~te~ted to receaue as it shall be his pleasure to gyue, ey+ther much, lytle, or nothynge.
Of god a loue we oughte to aske all good thyn+ges.To be short, what soeuer we haue nede of, we must streight wayes run vnto God  aske it of him only, why ther it pertayneth to the soule or to the body, whiche gyuethe to all men without doublenes,  casteth no ma~ into the tethe, as S. Austen sayeth: We ought to aske of none but of the LORDE God,Eench. ad Laure~|cap. cxii. what soeuer we truste that we eyther should worke well, or obtayne for good workes.


 The. xxx. Chapter.
BUt this is to be noted in prayer that in asmuche as all that pro|fesse Christ vnfaynedly, haue one co~|mo~  heaue~ly father,  are brothers one to another yee brothers to christ  fellowe heyres with hym,Rom. viii.  seynge that Christe also hath taught vs in his moost godly prayer, not onlye to praye for oure selues, but also for all other in common,Mat. vi. it shall be necessa|ry that a christe~ man doth so directe his prayer vnto God, that he maye seme no lesse to seke in it the helpe of his Christen brothers, than of hym+selfe. For true  vnfayned Charite, which procedeth from a pure herte  a good conscience,  a fayth not fay|ned, seketh not her owne,i. Tim. . i. Cor. xiii. but rather that whiche pertaynethe to other. She reioyceth no lesse in the health of other than in her owne.Beholde what chari+te doth. She ta|keth no lesse thought to profit other than her selfe. She reioyceth wyth them that reioyce,Rom. xii. i. Cor. xiii.  wepeth w^t them

that wepe. Yea she many tymes for+getteth her selfe,  is wholly bent to seke the commoditie of other, as S. Paule sayth,Exo. xxxii. Charite seketh not her owne. We read that such ferue~t cha+rite was in Moses, which whan the people of Israell had greuously offe~|ded God by worshippynge the golde~ Calfe, perceyuynge y^e wrath of God to be whotte agaynst the~, prayed on this manner  sayde, oh this people haue done a greate synne, and haue made them Goddes of golde. Nowe forgyue the~ theyr synne, or els wipe me out of this boke,Rom. ix. that thou hasle wrytte~. S. Paule also wyssted hym+selfe to be cursed from Christ for the Israelites. Christ commaundeth to blesse the~ that cursse vs,mat. v. to praye for the~ that do vs wro~ge  persecute vs howe much more than ought we, se|ynge ther is one boy  one spirite,Ephe. iiii. one LORDE, one sayth, one baptisme one God  father of vs all, to praye

one for another generally in the vni+te of the spiryte thorowe the bond of peace. If we search in the Histories of the moost sacred Byble, we shal in manny places fynde and euidently perceyue with howe gredy affeccion and feruent minde one prayed for a|nother, so y^e there was in theyr pray+ers a certayne godly co~munion,  a lke thought or care for all me~.Note this similytude. For as he that loueth y^e father of y^e house holde vnfaynedly, doth also loue her tely all his whole familye, so in lyke manner they that loue our celestial father with a true affecte  mynde, can none otherwise do but loue also his people, his householde. his heri|tage,Ephe. i. whom he hath so greatly hono|red y^e he hathe not disdayned to call them the plenitude  fulnesse of hys onlye begotten sonne.Our pray+ers ought to be co~mo~. Therfore the prayer of a Christen man oughte on such ma~ner to be made, that it may be common  co~prehende in it all me~

that are his brothers in Christ, and pertayne to the housholde of fayth. Yea he ought to praye for all men ly+uyng in this world, be they Turkes Sarace~nes, Iewes or ony other of the hethenysh  vnfaythfull sorte, y^e God maye delyuer them by this holy spiryte out of the darkenesses of yg|norancy,  brynge them into y^e mer|uaylous lyghte of his mooste blessed worde, that in the vnite of the Spi|rite they maye also confesse with vs one LORDE, one God, one sauyoure, one faythe, one Christen religion,  one trueth.
A questionBut some men wyll say peradue~+ture, is it not lawefull for a man to praye seuerally for himselfe,  for his owne priuate affayres?The aun|swere. Yies verely, so that the mynde be not vtterly de+flected  turned awaye from the co~|templacion of this co~munite, but re+ferreth all thynges vnto that.mat. xxvi For Christ prayed perticularely for hym|selfe

vnto hys Father a lytle before his passion.iii. Reg. xx Esa. xxxviii. Psa i. Luke. xviii math. xxvi Ezechias prayed for his owne health. Dauid prayed for the remission of his synne. The Publy|cane desyred mercy  forgyuenes of his offence. The these desyred Christ to remember hym, whan he came in to his kyngedome. All theise prayed theyr owne priuate affayres,  were hearde. Semblably it is lawfull for euery Christen man to lamente his owne cause before the mercyful eies of the diuyne maieste.
Arte thou a magistrate  gouer|noure of the common weale,Magistrate percey|uynge that thou wanteste wisdome to gouerne the people of God aright  accordyng to iustyce.iii. Re. iii. Than mayst thou lawfully pray w^t Salomon to God for the gyfte of wisdome.
Arte thou a minister of Goddes worde,Minister of Gods Lord so mayst thou after the exam+ple of the Apostles pray for the influ+ence of the holy Ghost, that y^e mayst

be repleted with the knowledge of spi+ritual thynges,Act. i.  so feed the flocke of Christ,Act. xx. whome he hath purchased w^e his moost precious bloud,i. Pet. v. that thou mayst receiue y^e i~marcessible crowne of glory, whan that Prynce of shepe heardes shall appeare.
Houshol|der.Arte y^ an housholder? tha~ mayst thou lawefullye praye vnto God for grace, that thou mayst gouerne and rule thy family accordynge to God|des moost holy worde.
Rytch ma~.Arte thou a rytch man, tha~ ough+test thou for to pray vnto God, that thou mayeste distribute his goodes co~mytted vnto the accordyng to his pleasure vpon the poore people. Arte thou poore?Poore ma~ than pray to God that thou mayst paciently suffer the crosse of pouerte, which he hath layd vpon the.Biio~. Felest thou ony vyce to raygne in the So mayeste thou be olde to praye vnto GOD for the suppression of that vyce, and for

the obtaynynge of y^e vertue co~trary to the vyce.
To be shorte,Christen man arte thou a Christe~ man? So mayst thou at al tymes be bolde to praye that God maye so en|dewe the with strength from aboue, that thou mayst lyue in all poyntes accordynge to thy profession.


 The. xxxi. Chapter.
BUt in thus prayenge for our sel+ues we must take hede, that we desyre not those thi~ges, which should turne to oure owne priuate auaun|tage,  to the hynderaunce or disco~|moditie of other. For this is not ac|ceptable in y^e syght of God.Math. xx. Mar. x. The chyl+dren of Zebedeus desyred Christe. y^e one of them might sitte on his right hande,  another on his lyfte hande. But Christ answered and sayde, ye knowe not what ye aske. They desy+red the primacy,  to be alofte in su|perioryte aboue a y^e disciples, which made the other to haue indignacion

at them b the.Nota That Peticion ther|fore is not lawefull nor ryghteous, whiche hathe a respecte more to pry|uate auauntage the~ to publique vt lite.Examples As yf a Phisicion shoulde praye that many might faull sycke or that they that are sycke, myght so conty|nue longe, that he myghte haue the more auau~tage. Or yf an heyre dyd praye that his parentes myght dye wortly, that y^e heritage myght quic|kely chaunse vnto hym. Or yf a wic|ked Souldiour dyd desyre that ma|ny temples might be spoyled, and di+uers honest men robbed, y^e he myght come home looden with proyes and robberies.
These  such lyke requestes, in as muche as they come for the from the fleshe, and not fro~ the spiryte, God, whiche is a spiryte,Ioan. iiii. dothe not heare the~,Ia. iiii. as S. Iames sayth, ye aske and receyue not, bycause ye aske euell, y^e ye maye consume it on your pleasu|res.

And yf he heareth, certes he hea+reth vnto the great euell  inco~mo|ditie of them y^e praye. For they store vppe  prouoke the anger of God to+warde them.Ser liii. de ver. Dom. secu~d, Ioan S. Austen sayth, thi~ke it no great thyng to be herd at your owne wyll, but rather thyncke it a great thynge to be heard vnto your profytte. For the dyuels were herde at theyr owne wyl,  were suffred to go into y^e swyne accordyng to theyr desyre.matt. viii. Theyr Prynce also the diuell was heard at his owne wyll, whiche desyred to haue Iob  to tempt him.Iob. i. The Israelites also were hearde at theyr owne wyll,  whan the meate was yet in theyr mouthe,Ex. xvi. Num. xi. ye knowe what thynges followed. Thyncke it therfore no great thynge to be heard at youre owne wyll  pleasure. For God sometyme beynge angrye gy|ueth that, which thou askest,  God beynge mercyfull  well pleased, de|nyeth that, which thou askest.

But yet is theyr prayer much more wicked, which beyng enflamed with the fyre of malicious fury,  furious malyce, do desyre euell to the~ selues, that worse maye chau~se vnto theyr brother, whome they hate. Yea there want not, which not only coulde be content with all theyr hertes to lose one of theyr eyes, so that he, whome they hate, myght lose both, but also, put theyr owne lyues in iopardy to brynge deathe vnto other. O cruell tyranny. Such peticions be detesta+ble,  are to the desyrers therof, not only much pernicious, but also very damnable, in asmuch as they stonde not with the order of Charite. This also is to be iudged of them, whiche curse and banne such as they hate. Let vs therfore aske nothynge, but that maketh to the glory of God the auau~ceme~t of his moost holy worde, the encrease of vertue, the destrucci|on of vyce, y^e helth of our soules, the

conseruacion of the publigue weale,  the profytte of our neyghbour.Not In all our peticions let vs submyt our selues to the wyll  pleasure of God nothyng doubtyng but that he wyl graunt vs that we aske, or els thyn+ges of more weyghtye importaunce  more profitable for our saluacion. For it is not alwaye co~uenient that we shoulde obtayne what soeuer we aske of God. He knowethe muche better what we haue nede of, then we our selues do. It is many tymes more expedient for vs to haue scase|nes than abou~dau~ce, to be vexed w^t warres  persecucions tha~ to enioy carnall securite  flesshely quietnes, to be sick tha~ to be whole, to be te~ted tha~ to be w^tout te~tacio~ Paule at di|uers tymes desyred God y^t he myght be delyuered fro~ y^e prych of y^e flesshe,ii. Cor. xii but it was answered my grace is suf+ficie~t for the,  he reioyced in his in yrmite  weakenes. Therfore in al thyn|ges

let vs praye for godly  honeste thynges, beynge alwaye contented to receyue, as it shall be Gods moost holy pleasure to gyue.



 At what tyme we oughte to praye.

 The. xxxii. Chapter.
_IF we consyder the inex|plicable  manifold mi|series, wherwith in this vale of calamite we are inuolued, wrapped and i~closed about on euery syde, we shall w^tout ony great difficulte perceyue y^ we haue nede of nothyng so much as of prayer, yea and that feruente, assiduous  continuall. For the dy|uell goeth about lyke a roaryng Ly+on, sekynge whome he maye deuour.i. Pet. . The world also with his vayne plea|sures is redye at euerye houre to se|duce  lede vs awaye fro~ our profes|sio~, yf we take not hede. Agayne the

flesshe is so domesticall and nygh ene+my vnto vs, that we can neuer be w^toute it.Gal. v. It euer assaylethe vs. It all+waye fyghteth  lusteth contrary to the spirite. It turneth, as they saye, euery stonne to make vs enemies w^t God. The soldiour of Christ, sayth a certayne Doctor,Parpar Crac. de Iu+sticia cap. xii. oughte not to put awaye from him the shelde of prayer so longe as the battayle endurethe. But the battayle endureth,Iob. vii. so longe as this prese~t lyfe endureth, as Iob sayth, the lyfe of a man vpo~ y^ earthe is a warfare,  perels do neuer fayle therfore haue we nede continuallye of Gods helpe. Miserye dothe ne|uer want in this lyfe, therfore haue we euer nede of Gods mercy  conti+nuall prayer.ii Tim. ii. Wherof it followeth y^t we haue greate nede of prayer at all tymes, yf we wyll be saued. For no man shalbe crowned, excepte he war+reth valeauntly.Apo. ii. To him that ouer|commeth, sayth God, wyll I gyue to

eate of the tree of lyfe, whiche is in  myddes of the Paradyse of GOD. Our sauiour Christ therfore know|ynge our imbecillite  weakenes to be no lesse than oure miserye  wret|chednes, exortetth vs principallye  aboue all thynges to praye.Mat. xxvi Watche  praye, sayth he, that ye faul not in to tentacio~. And in as much as our enemies cease not to fyghte agaynst vs by theyr craftye  subtyle assaul|tes, therfore oughte we not to cease for to fyght agaynst the~ w^t continu|all prayers. For the prayer of a righ+ous man,Iaco. v. sayethe S. Iames, auay|leth muche.Luk. xviii. Christe in the Gospell of Luke proponeth a certayne parable of an vnrighteous Iudge  of a wy+dowe, wherin he teachethe that we ought to praye alwaye and neuer to cease, nor once to be werye. Read the Chapter. A Christen man oughte to praye at all tymes,  neuer to desyst and cease from prayenge. Therfore

sayth S. Paule:Col. iiii Co~tinue in prayer  wacth in it with thankes giyng. Agayne:i. Thes. v. Reioyse alwaye, pray with out ceasyng, in all thynges giue tha~+kes. Hereto agreeth y^e sayenge of S. Peter,. Pet. iiii. be ye sober  watch vnto prai+er. For continuall prayer causethe y^t our enemies can not haue the vpper hande ouer vs. Yea continuall pray+er makethe that the loue of celestiall goodes doth euer encrese i~ vs, which excepte it be oftentymes suscitated  stored vp with ardent desyres and ferue~t prayers,Not as fyre is w^t wind, it fyrst abateth,  afterward by lytle  lytle it is vtterly quenched and put clene out. For as he is vnworthy to receyue ony thynge, whiche gyueth not thanckes for those thynges y^ he hath alredy taken, y^t is, whiche doth not knowledge  magnify the benefi+cence of God, so dothe not he deserue to enioy so great felicite, ioye  plea|sure, which eyther doth not desyre it

or els desyreth it coldly. Who ferue~t+ly loueth a thinge,  doth not co~tinu+ally wish y^ey^ thyng which he loueth, maye chau~se to hi~. So y^ it is mani|fest of these thynges aforsayde, y^t we ought to praye at all tymes,  neuer cease, in asmuch as we haue at all ty+mes moost vrge~t, weyghty  necessa|ry causes.


 The. xxxiii. Chapter.
An obiec|tio~.BUt it wyll be obiected, howe is it possible for a man to praye at all tymes,  neuer to cease? This is a thynge not onlye of impossibilite, but also contrary to the co~maunde|ment of Christ,Mat. vi. whiche sayeth, whan ye praye, speake not manny wordes. I answere,The aun|swere. Christe in this aforsayde place doth not forbyd the assiduite  continuance of prayer, but y^e multi|loquie  manner of bablyng in pray|ers, which the Ethnickes  Infidels dyd vse, trustyng by y^ theyr to much bablynge they shoulde the sooner be

hearde, as we reade of those wycked Prophetes, which cried on the name of Baal from mornynge tyll nyght, sayenge none other thynge but this only,iii. Reg. xvi O Baal hear vs, O Baal hear vs. But the prophet Helias mocked them, sayenge, crye withe a loweder voyce. For he is a God, but peradue~+ture he talkethe with some bodye, or is occupied in pursuynge his enemi+es, or is gone some iourney, or happe+ly he slepeth,  would be waked  rey+sed vp w^t your cryinge. They cryed therfore w^t a great voice,  cutte the~+selues after ther old maner w^t swear+des and botkyns, vntyll they were al on gore bloude. But all in vayne.
The wordes of Christe are these, whan ye praye,math. vi. speke not many wor|des as the Ethnyckes do. For they thynke it should come to passe, that thorowe theyr bablynge they should be heard. Be not ye therfore lyke the~ For youre father doth knowe, what

thynges ye nede, before ye aske o him.Mark wel These wordes shew manifest|ly that Christ doth not co~demne the assiduite  continuaunce of prayer,Lu. vi. xxii mat. xxvi. Luk: xviii: which bothe he hiselfe vsed, and also taught other y^e same, but the vayne loquasite  vnfruytfull bablyng an+nexed with this perswasio~, that our prayers can not be herde, except we be euer inculkyng  beatynge the~ in+to the eares of God after the ma~ner of the Hethe~, as though God dyd ra+ther heare vs for oure loquasite and bablynges sake, than for his mooste louynge and gentle promyse, or as thogh God were not so redy to giue, as we are to aske, if our peticions be|accordyng vnto his wyl. The Eth|nickes multloquy  hethenysh bab|lynge doth Christe here not only for+byd, but also conde~n.Eccl: v: Therfore say|eth y^e wyse man, be not to rash in spe+kynge, neyther lette thy herte make hast to bryng forth a word in y^ sight

of god. For god is in heue~,  y^u art on the earth,  therfore let thy wordes be fewe. For as the dreame co~methe of manifold businesses, so is y^ voyce of a foole in y^e multitude of wordes.
S. Iohn golden mouth vpon the aforsayd texte wryteth on this man+ner, he calleth here Bathologian,In Math: cap. vi. Hom. xix. lo+quacite, that is, bablynge or muche spekynge, which we than verely vse, when we aske of God thynges y^t are not profitable for vs, as for an exam+ple, that we shoulde obtayne power  glory,  that we shoulde ouercome our enemies,  that we should abou~d with many rytches, to co~clude, wha~ we aske those thynges, y^e should pro+fyt vs nothynge at all. For he know+eth what so euer we haue nede.
Moreouer he semeth vnto me to for+byd longe prayers. Yea verely, long I saye, not in tyme but in the multi+tude  prolixite or length of wordes.Colos. iiii. We must perseuer in askynge those

thynges that are profitable. Conti|nue, sayth he, i~ prayer. For y^ LORDE hymselfe also sendeth vs to the exa~|ple of y^t wydowe  of y^e vnmercyfull  cruel Iudge,Luke. xiii that he should co~me~d the diligente continuau~ce of prayer by the importunite of her interpel|lacion  hertye request.Luke. xi. And wha~ he saythe y^ a certayne man came vnto his frende, whan it was very late in the nyghte,  that he raysed hym be|yng a slepe out of his bed, yea  that he deserued this thyng not so much for familiarite  acquaynta~ce sake, as for sedulite  careful dilige~ce: He wylled none other thynge, tha~ that he should be called vpon co~tinually. Yet he dyd not co~maunde that they shoulde brynge vnto him a prayer of a thousande verses longe,  recyte y^ vnto hym. For this hathe he alredy reproued. For they thyncke that in theyr muche speakynge they shoulde be herd.Mat. vi. But your father, sayeth he,

knoweth, what ye haue nede, before ye aske. But thou wylte saye, If he knoweth, wherfore than nede we to praye?Mark  well. Uerely not y^e thou shouldeste teach God, but that thou shouldeste make hym good vnto the, that thou shouldest be acquaynted wyth hym, by reason of thy frequent  ofte~ spe|kynge vnto hym, that y^ shouldest h~+ble thy selfe in prayeng,  that thou shouldest oftentymes remember thy synnes.
Hytherto haue I recyted the wor+des of S. Iohn Chrisostome, which as they condemne the vnfruytefull bablynge  vayne ianglynge of wor+des vaynly  causses prolated, so do they hyghlye co~mende  approue the feruent continuaunce of prayenge. So that hereof it is euident, that a thriste~ ma~ ought to pray at al times


 The. xxxiiii. Chapter.
VUher as some ma~ wyll saye per aduenture that it is not possi|ble

for men to praye at all tymes, se|ynge that diuers other affayres and businesses muste also be done of the~ so longe as they lyue in this worlde, as eatynge, drynkynge, slepyng. c.  men must also labour for theyr ly|uynge, euery man accordyng to his vocacion  callynge, which thynges all must nedes be an impedyment  let to the co~tinuall exercyse of pray|er: I wyl in few wordes declare how a christen man maye praye without ceasynge at all tymes accordyng to the precepte of Christe and the Apo|stle Saynt Paule.
How we may praye at all ty|mes and  cea|syng.Some expositoures of the holye Scrypture wryte that to praye all waye  without ceasyng, is nothing els than to pray seriously, earnestly  diligently after the example of the wydowe,Luk. xviii. which woulde neuer leaue cryenge  callynge vpon the vnrigh+teous Iudge, vntyll he had hearde her request, that she myght be reuen|ged

of her aduersarye. They saye it is a trope called Hyperbole, so that he is counted to praye alway and w^t out ceasyng, which praye vsually, of tentymes, seriously  instantly, and doth not cease from prayers, vntyll he hath obtayned that,Esa. lviii. which he as|keth. After that manner is this spo|ke~: Cry, cease not, lyfte vp thy voyce as a Trompe.
Some saye that to praye alway  not to cease, is thorowe out al our lyfe, feruentely to desyre that hyghe goodnes, which is promysed vs in y^e worlde to come. After this sorte, say, they, what soeuer me~ do in this lyfe, whether they eate, dryncke, sleape worke, talke, bargayne, studye, medi|tate. c. so longe as this celestiall de|syre remayne in the~, all theyr whole lyfe is a certayne perpetual prayer.De moda orai. The perpetual study of lyuyng god+ly, sayeth Erasmus, is a continuall prayer. And Beda sayth, he prayeth

alwaye, y^ doth good thynges alway neyther dothe he cease to praye, but  he ceaseth to be righteous.
Other affyrme that to praye with+out ceasyng, is feruently  with an ardente mynde to praye at certayne houres destinated  appoynted vn|to prayer. Uerely all theise exposici|ons, in asmuch as they be godly, are not to be reiected nor caste awaye. Therfore seyng that we can not for our imbecille, weaknes  imperfec+cio~ alwaye  withoute ceasyng pray vnto God, yet, besydes the godly me+ditacion of celestiall thynges in our mynde,  the perpetuall desyre of ly|uyng innoce~tly, which ought neuer to departe from a Christe~ brest,Certeyne houres ap+poynted e|uery day for prayer that hath the feare of God before her eies we ought to prescrybe  appoynt vn+to our selues certaine peculiare hou+res euery day which should not passe awaye w^tout prayer,  which should haue the whole affectes of the mynd

vtterly occupied in this behalfe. And whan those houres shall come, than ought we to laye asyde all m|dane affayres  worldly businesses,  wholly to gyue our selues to deuout meditacion,  diuyne contemplacio~ of celestiall thynges. Tha~ ought we feruentely to praye w^t the herte and mynd,  so w^t all humilite to behaue our selues, as though god were ther present,  we spake vnto him face to face, ye than ought we to watche, as the Scripture admonysshe the,Mat. xxvi. that is, so take hede  cast all pereis, that oure aduersary the dyuell, which go+eth about lyke a rorynge Lyon,i. Pet. v. sea|kyng whome he may deuour, do not once drawe away our myndes from talkynge wyth God, but that quiet+ly and attentely we maye be occupi|ed in offerynge vp our peticions vn+to GOD at that tyme of prayer.


 The. xxxv. Chapter.
ANd bycause no man shoulde be offended w^t the obseruaunce  appoyntme~t of certayne houres vn+to prayer, as a thynge supersticious  repugnant to the christen liberte: I wyll shewe that dyuers holye men had theyr certayn houres also, wher+in they vsed custumably to pray.. cxviii. We reade that Dauid dyd praye  gyue thankes vnto God seuen tymes in a daye. His wordes are these: Seuen tymes in a day haue I gyue~ prayse vnto the for the iudgementes of thy righteousnes. What seuen tymes in a daye these were, all are not many|fest in the holye scripture, but some are, whiche I wyll here reherse.
As touchynge the mornynge he sayeth, O LORDE early shalt y^u heare my voyce,Psal. v. betymes in the mornyng shall I make my prayer vnto the,  I shall se that I haue obtayned my prayer.Psal. ci. Nowe for the tyme of his re|paste he sayeth, as asshes dyd I eate

my bread  my dryncke dyd I myn|gle with wepynge. Thoughe here he make the none euydente mencion of Prayer, yet it is not to be doubted, but y^t in this his great sorowe, he al+so vsed at that present, prayers vnto God. As for his prayer at nyght, we read on this manner,Psal. ciiii. let my prayer, sayth he, be directed vnto the as fra~+kensence in thy syghte, the lyftynge vp of my handes as an euenyng sa|crifice.Psal. vi. Agayne he sayth, I shal wash euery nyght my bed, yea euen w^t my teares wyll I water my bed. That he prayed to God at mydnyght also, it is manifeste by theyse wordes, At myddenyght, sayth he, dyd I ryse to gyue prayse vnto the.
Of these Scriptures aforsayd it is euident that Dauid prayed vnto God customably these four times be+sides other,Psa. cxviii. that is, in the mornyng, at his dynner, in the euenynge, and at mydnyght, which all be very con|uenient

tymes for a christen man to praye. As he prayed at these tymes, so did he vndoutedly at other, thogh they be not expressed in y^ scripture.
Dan. vi.Moreouer we read that Daniel vsed customably to praye euery day thre tymes vnto his LORDE GOD. The Euangelistes also declare, that Christ preachynge  workynge my|racles all the whole daye,Luk. v. vsed often tymes to spende the whole nyght in prayenge vnto his father.Act. iii. S. Luke also in the Actes of y^e Apostles decla+reth that Peter  Iohn went vp in|to the Te~ple at the nynthe houre of prayer. Wherof it doth euidently ap+peare y^ in the olde lawe they had cer+tayne tymes appoynted in y^ whiche they should praye. Haue not we also amonge vs nowe a dayes certayne tymes appoynted for to come togy|ther  to pray in the temples? What do we lerne of all these thynges Ue|rely that a Christen man maye law|fully

 without ony scripule of con|science appoynt certayne houres in the day, wherin he may exercyse him+selfe deuoutly in godly prayer  spi|rituall meditacion.Not: But I would he shoulde not so supersticiously be ad|dicte to those houres, that he should thynke it synne to breake ony of the~, whan occasion of necessite is gyuen (for that were a wycked thyng) but to vse those tymes as meanes for to bryng hym vnto a more feruent ma~+ner of prayeng continually.Mat. ii. For the Sabboth daye was made for man,  not man for the Sabboth day. The kyngedome of God shall not come w^t obseruacio~  loking for,Luk. xvii: sayth Christ neyther shall they saye, behold here, or behold there, for loo, the kyngdom of god is w^tin you. Ye obserue dayes monethes,Gala. iiii. tymes and yeares, sayth Paule, I am afearde of you, vnlesse I haue laboured in vayne for you. Agayn, let no ma~ iudge you in meat

or drynke, or in parte of an holy day, or of the feast of the newe Moone, or of the Sabbothes, which are the sha+dowes of thynges to come,Col. ii. but the body of Christ.


 The. xxxvi. Chapter.
SEynge than that the appoynte|ment of certayne houres for prai+er is very co~mendable, yea  necessa+ry for the traynynge vp of oure sel|ues in the godlye exercyse of prayer (so that supersticious obseruaunce be absent) it shall be much dece~t and prayse worthy for euery man to ap|poynte hymselfe such certayne hou|res euery daye for to praye, as wher|in he shall perceyue that he maye be moost quiet,  moost apte to talke w^e God in his prayers. And althoughe euery Christen man knowethe what tyme is best for hym to praye (in as much as the vnccion of God techeth the~ all thynges,i. Ioan. ii.  they haue no nede that any man shoulde teach the~) yet

I wyll here assigne suche houres to pray, as I maye thynke to be moost conuenient  apte to prayer,  that not only bycause they seme fytte in my conceyte, but rather in asmuche as I se those same houres approued of godlye learned men, as moost fyt|tyng and apte vnto the true exercise of prayer.
Dauid in his Psalmes wrytethe on this manner,Psa. lilii. I wyll cry to God,  the LORDE shall saue me. At nyght  in the mornyng  at middaye shall I praye hertelye,  he shall heare my voyce.Note wha~ we ought to pray vn+to God. Here Dauid prescribeth thre solemne tymes, whan a man oughte of dutie euery day to pray. At night when he goeth to bed, in y^e morninge whan he ryseth,  at mydday whan he goeth to meate. He that leaue the God vnsaluted with his prayers at these thre tymes, verely he is muche estrau~ged fro~ the manners of a true Christen man, as I maye leaue of to

speake of his ingratitude  vnkynd+nes towarde oure LORDE GOD.
Libro de virginita|te.S. Ambrose appoynte the mo ty|mes of prayenge: Solemne prayers sayth he, ought to be made w^t thanc+kes geuynge whan we ryse fro~ slepe, when we go forth to oure businesse, whe~ we make redy to take our meat and whan we haue taken our meat  when we go to bed. Would God y^ all men would followe the doctryne of this moost holy  catholyke Doc|tor. Than shoulde all thynges be re|plenyshed with the blessynge of God more plenteously than they are now a dayes.De orati|one. Det. ii. S. Iohn Chrisostome diffe+reth not from this, where he sayeth, we must wha~ we ryse out of our bed+des preuent the sonne with the wor|shyppynge of God,  whan we come to the table,  whan we should slepe. Yea at euerye houre oughte we to offer a lyuysh prayer vnto God, and to runne an equall course withe the daye,  in y^e tyme of Wynter to spe~d

also y^ moost part of y^e nyght in pray|ers  bowi~g our knees w^t much feare to gyue atte~dau~ce to prayer, recoun+ting our selues blessed, wha~ we thus worshyp God. Tel me how dareste y^u loke vpo~ the Sonne,Mark well. wha~ y^u dost not worshyp hym, that sent that mooste swete  co~fortable lyght? How shalt thou vse y^e table,  not worshyp y^ gy+uer  supeditatour of so great good thiges? With what hope goest thou to the tyme of the night, what man|ner of slepes doste thou loke for, whe~ thou doste not confyrme, make stro~g  defend thy selfe with prayers, but wythout ony watch comest to slepe lyke a miser  wretche, redy to faull into the captiuitie  bondage of the moost vngracious diuels, which co~|tinually go about waytyng y^ tyme, that they maye quickely catche any man that is bare,  not defensed w^t prayer? which whan they se vs enar+med w^t prayers, ru~ne backe streight

wayes as theues  malefactoures, which se a swearde hanged vp at the hande of y^ Soldiour. But if it cha~+seth that any man be bare  not we|poned w^t prayer, than is he streyght waye plucked  toste of the diuels, he is moued vnto synne,  brought in|to infinyte calamities  euelles. We therfore fearynge all these thynges let vs enarme oure selues alwaye w^t prayers  hymnes, that god hauing pytie on vs, maye make vs all wor|thy y^e kyngedome of heauen thorow his onlye begotten sonne, to whome be glory and rule, worldes wythout ende.
Amen.


 The. xxxvii. Chapter.
HItherto haue I recyted y^ wor|des of the golde~ mouthed Doc|tor, wherin we may learne not only whan we oughte to praye, but also howe necessary a thynge prayer is,  how that w^tout prayer we can do no+thynge well, neyther can any thyng

without that chaunse vnto vs pros|perously.Prayers in  mor|nyng. Would God therfore that whan we ryse in the mornynge we would with hundle  faythfull her|tes gyue thankes to God, for y^ slepe wherwith he hath refresshed one we|ry bodies that nyght,   ly desyre hym that his  maye haue the ryght gouernounce of vs, all y^e daye followynge, that he defendynge vs from all euell maye only his, couye, aspyre  go aboute those thges, which shall may turne to the glory of God, the saluacion of our soules,  the profytte of y^ Chri|sten publyque weae, not once offen|dynge the eies of the diuyne maieste neyther in thought, worde nor dede at ony tyme.
Agayne in asmuche as we are all orne to laboure,Prayers be|fore laboure.; Iob. v. euery man in hys offyce, euer as the byrde is to flye,  seynge that we are commaunded of God to eate the labours of our han|des



 The. xxxviii. Chapter.
Prayers before meate.MOreouer whan we shall take our meat before we syt down to tast ony of it, let vs w^t al humilite  submission of mynd desyre God w^t oure prayers, that he wyll sanctifye those his gyftes  benefites, that we maye receyue the~ accordynge to his wyll,  by no meanes abuse them, ey+ther to the distemperance of our bo|dies, or to the daunger of our soules but only receyue them vnto y^e ende, for the which they were created and prepared. Lette vs not thyncke it y|nough to haue corporal food, except it be blessed of God. Neyther oughte we to thynke that oure bodely suste| commeth only of our owne polcy but much more rather of god+des blessynge, whiche excepte he dyd fortune oure trauayles, aoue la|bours were but vayne,Psa. xxxiii  y^ Psalmo+graphe sayth, feare ye the LORDE all ye that be his Sayntes, for there is

no searsenes to the~ y^e feare hym. The rytche haue wanted  hungred, but they y^ seke after y^e LORDE, shal want no good thynge.Psal. Agayne, caste thy care vpon the LORDE,  he shall no|ryshe the.i. Pet. v. Also in another place, The eyes of all me~ trust in the, O LORD,  thou gyuest them meate in conue|nient tyme.Psal. cxiiiii. Thou openest thy ha~de, and fylleste euery lyuynge creature with thy blessynge.
Thus se we y^ our corporall foode is the gyfte of God,  he it is that fe+dethe so many, as repose theyr affy|aunce in hym. Therfore oughte we before we taste any meate at y^ tyme of oure repaste to praye vnto God, y^ he maye blesse the meat that we sha than receyue, confessynge y^e what so euer we haue, we al togither receyue it of his bountyous hand.Nota. O mercy|full God, we come nowe a dayes vn|to the table, as though we ware He|then,  knew no parte of God, at the

of the Altare, his beri body  bloud?  dyd he this aely for our ex+ample, that we should knowledge  confesse that what so euer we haue, we receyue it altogyther at the |teous  liberall hand of God. Doth not S. Paule saye,i. Tim. iiii. that meates are sanctifyed by the worde of God and prayer We oughte therfore surelye whan we go to dynner, or take onye repast, to desyre God for to blesse our meat,  to make it helthfull  profy|table to our bodies,  to beleue that what soeuer is there presente, we re|ceyue it altogyther of the grand mu+nificence  excedynge liberalytie of God,  so to behaue oure selues all y^ time of our repast, not only i~ enioyi~g those gyftes moderately  soberlye, but also in oure co~municacion,  ex|ternall gestures, that we maye seme to sytte not at a prophane, co~mme  vncleane table, but at y^ holye table of y^e celestiall and euerlastyng kyng.



 The. xxxix. Chapter.
AGayne after we haue thus god+ly  soberly take~ oure meate,Grace or thanckes gyuyng af|ter dyner. let vs not fayle to gyue God herty tha~c+kes for his benefytes, which so boun+teously of his owne mere lyberalitie  great goodnes hath fed vs at that presente, let vs also desyre hym that he wyll go forth to be a beneficial fa|ther vnto vs,Ioan. vi.  to giue vs meat, not only that meate whiche peryssheth, but much rather y^t whiche abydethe into euerlastynge lyfe, I meane the moost swete Gospell of his intierlye beloued so~ne Iesus Christ our moste gentle LORDE  omnisufficient Sa|uiour, y^ our bodies beyng fed w^t cor|porall meate,  our soules susteyned with the word of lyfe, we maye after this lyfe be moost happely fed wyth the aspecte, beholdyng,  fruicion of the moost blessed deite. Amen.
These thynges once done, let be returne to our labours, euery mn

accordynge to his vocacion and cal|lynge, workyng that thynge that is pleasaunt in the syght of God.
For supper Note.Whan the tyme co~meth that we shall go to supper, let vs w^e the same reuerence enioy the good creatures of God, that we dyd at dynner,  as we behaued our selues at di~ner both in prayer  thanckes gyuynge, lette vs so likewyse do at supper. So shal it come to passe vndoubtedlye, that we shall wante no good thynge, but haue plenty of all thiges accordyng to onr hertes desyre. We must, sayth Chrisostome,De oratio+ne. bothe whan we go vn|to the table  come fro~ it,Ho. lxxxviii. gyue tha~c|kes to God. For that table, which be gynneth of prayer,  endethe also in prayer, shall neuer wante, but shall brynge to vs all good thynges more largely  more plentiously than ony fountayne. But I haue spoken of this matter also in my Banckette.


 The. xl. Chapter.
AT night whan we go to bedde,How we ought to be haue our+selues wh~ we go to bed. we shall before we gyue our sel|ues to slepe, knele downe vpon oure knees secretly in our chamber, with all humilite  reuere~t feare, callyng vnto our reme~brau~ce howe we haue spent all the whole daye past. If we shall than perceyue that we haue of|fended y^e diuine maiesty in ony thi~g, eyther in thought, word or dede, tha~ let vs not fayle to confesse our synne streyghtway to God w^t a contryte  sorowfull herte, desyryng him moost hu~bly for his great mercyes sake to forgyue vs that our iniquite,  not to be angry with vs, but so assyst vs with the influence of his moost holy Spirite, that we may in no poynte tra~sgresse his moost diuine wyl, but worke all thynges that maye be plea+saunt vnto hym.
Yf we shal at that tyme perceyue that we are at debate with ony ma~,Mark w. let vs no~t go to bed, before we be re|conciled

one to another if it be possible accordynge to the precepte of y^e Apo|stle, let not the Sonne faull downe vpo~ your anger.Cobe. iiii. If that may not co~+uenie~tly be done y^t nighte, let vs not fayle the nexte mornynge betymes, or so sone as we may, to go vnto the~ that are offended w^t vs, or we w^e the~,  neuer cease tyll we haue made an agreme~t betwene vs, beyng perfect+ly perswaded, that we can by no me|nes please God so long as we be not in loue and charite.i. Ioan. iii. For as S. Iohn~ sayth he that loueth not his brother abideth in death. Euery one that ha+tethe his brother is a manslear,  ye knowe that euery ma~slear hath not euerlastynge lyfe abydynge in hym.
 Loke what we haue offended god that daye, let vs so bewayle our syn  take suche thought for y^e co~mission of it, y^t we maye haue no more plea|sure to do that offe~ce agayne, but ra+ther be made the more circumspecte

 beware afterward y^e we be no more oppressed with the subtyle assaultes of Sata~. Let vs euery daye dye vn|to synne. Let vs continually morty|fye the affectes of the olde Ada~. The lenger we lyue, the lesser let synne re+mayne in this oure mortall bodye. Let all our meditacio~, study  ende|uour be nothynge els than a perpe|tuall care to leade a pure and inno|cent lyfe.


 The. xli. Chapter.
BUt yf it so chaunse,Nota. that whan we haue co~sydered the spending of the daye, we perceyue no notable cryme  heynous faulte commytted neyther agaynst God, nor our neigh+bour, than let vs reioyse, gyue God thankes,  desyre hym so co~tinually to ayde vs withe his diuine helpe, y^e we maye not onlye continue in that purite of lyfe,Rom. i. Psal. lxxxiii but also go forth from sayth to sayth,  from vertue to ver+tue, tyll we waxe auncient in christ,

 become perfette me~ i~ our professio
Prayers before rape.Theise thynges once done, let vs than faull to prayer, desyrynge God for his great mercies sake thorow Ie+sus Christe to gyue vs a prosperous  quiet nyght,  that neyther Sat nor none of his Aungels do trouble vs, but that thoughe the bodye take rest  slepe, yet the mynde, the herte, the inwarde man, may alway watch to him,  delight in hi perpetually.
After oure prayers, let vs co~myt oure selues to the tuicion of God,  so swetely gyue our selues to reste. And let this be our dayely exercyse. D LORDE God, yf we would do this with a serue~t herte  burnyng loue towarde God, it can not be expressed that greate  singulare co~modities would ensewe. To do thus, is y^e du|tye of vs all, but whyther we haue done it or not, let euery man search his owne conscience and amende.
Thus haue I declared what tymes

I thyncke moost co~uenient for prayer,  how we should behaue our+selues in y^e tyme of pray eng. I haue not done this to bynde  snarlethe conscience of ony christe~ man, which oughte to be free to serue God at all houres, but to helpe the infyrme and weake Christians, that they fyrst v|synge these tymes,  certayne intro|duccions, maye afterward come vn|to the perfeccion of worshyppynge God at all tymes. For a christen ma~ hall haue abundant occasions at all houres to call on y^e name of y^e LORD for helpe. Notwithstandynge yf ony man shall loke vpon these thynges, y^e I haue here wrytten, with a syngle eye, he shall not fynde the~ altogyther superuncaneous  vayne. God giue vs all grace to so followe the~, or bet|ter, yf we maye.



 Of thankes gyuynge.

 The. xlii. Chapter.
_NOwe begynne the oure worke to draw vnto an ende. I haue declared sufficiently heretofore, as I trust, all thynges that moost principally pertayne vn+to prayer, that is to say, vnto asking ony thynge of God. It remaynethe nowe therfore that I intreate some+what of thanckes gyuynge to God. For it is conuenient y^e we also gyue thanckes vnto God for the gyftes  benefytes that we receyue of hym, or els we maye iustely seme to be vn|worthy ony parte of Gods kyndnes For what haue we, y^e we haue not re+ceyued? The wyfe ma~ oughte not to oyse in his wisdome, nor the stro~g  his strength, nor yet y^e rytch  spiches, but only in our LORDE God, from whom euery good  perfecte gyfte descendeth and com+meth downe.Iacob. i. What haste thou that y^u haste not receyued, sayeth Paule?

If thou haste receyued it,i. Cor. iiii. wherfore doste thou reioyse, as though y^u had|dest not receyued it? Let not y^e wyse man,Iere. ix. sayth God by his Prophet, re|ioyse in his wisdome, nor let not the strong man reioyse in his strength, nor let not the rytch man reioyse in his rytches. But let him that reioy|ceth, reioyse in this, yf he vndersto~d  knowe me. For I am the LORDE, which doth mercye, iudgement and righteousnes in y^e earth,  these are those thynges that I desyre, saythe the LORDE.
Seynge than y^u all our glory and reioycyng ought to be in our LORDE God alone,Phil. iiii. as S. Paule sayeth, re|ioyse in the LORDE al way,  agayne I saye reioyse feynge also y^e what so euer goodnes is in vs,  ly of him, eely me oug at all hou+res to reioyse in hym, as the  blessed virgin Marye dyd, sayenge my soule magnifyethe the LORDE; 

my spiryte hath reioysed in God my sauiour,Luke. ii  to gyue to him thankes,  to synge to his name, so long as our lyfe lasteth, perpetuall encomies, lau+des co~mendacion and prayses.
How we maye be moued to gyue God thanckes.If we wyll be moued to gyue god thanckes at any tyme, as we ought to do alwaye, it shall be fyrste conue|nient to perpende, weye,  consyder his manifolde goodnes towarde vs. Fyrste howe at the begynnynge he made vs not lyke vnto brute bestes,Of oure creacion. Note. but lyke vnto his owne symilytude  Image. And he made vs not to be fyre brondes of hel, but inheritours of euerlastyng glory. For he gaue vs a body muche more beautyfull and pleasau~t in aspecte, than any other lynynge creature hath. He gaue vs a mynd rendued with wytte, rea+son, discre, wisdom, vertu, know|ledge, cunnynge, immortalite, godli+nes. c He set vs in Paradyse,Gen. i. and gaue vs rule, power,  dominio~ ouer|all

the fysshes of the see,  the byrdes of the ayre,  ouer all lyuynge crea+tures that moue vpon the earth.
Agayne whan we in our pare~tes had tra~sgressed his moost godly pre|cepte,Gen. iii.  therby deserued eternall da~|nacion,ii. Pet. ii. he dydde not streyghtwaye with the same rigoure  fearcenesse, wherwith he conde~ned the Aungels for theyr disobedient arroga~cy,Esa. xiiii. caste vs awaye into the fyre of Hell, but full gentely sent vs into this vale of misery for to repe~t,Gen. iii. Psal. viii. that afterward he myght saue vs, yet constitutyng  appoyntynge vs styll Lordes  ru+lers oueral lyuyng creatures.


 The. xliii. Chapter.
MOreouer wha~ it was not pos+sible bycause of the great enor+mite of our synne,Of our fro saluacion by grace  the mercy of God tho+row Iesus Christ. that we coulde of our owne power, strength, merytes, deseruynges  good workes saue  wynne our selues agayne into y^e fa|uour of God, howe louyngly w^toute

ony desertes of our parte eue~ of hys owne mere goodnes and free mercy did he promise to saue vs by his dere+ly beloued sonne oure LORDE Iesus Christ,Rom. i.  at his tyme predefined and appoynted from euerlastynge sente him downe in  his worlde? Which for our sake vnfaynedly by the won+derfull operacion of the holy Ghoste toke flessh of the moost blessed,Luke. i. Math. i. Heb. iiii moost pure,  vndefyled virgyn Marye,  became very man lyke vnto vs in al+thynges, sinne alone excepte. Which also after he had lyued here certayne yeares, eue~ of his owne free wyll w^t|out any compulsion for the feruent  vnspekable loue that he euer bare towarde vs, gaue hymselfe vnto the very  yea euen the moost spite full   deathe of the Crosse. He offered  oost blessed bodye a swete smellynge Sacrifyce to God the father for oure wyckednesse.Esa. liii. Phil. ii. Ephe. v. He suffred his moost precious bloude to

be shed vpo~ the Altare of the Crosse to paye the rau~some for our synnes.Mat. xxvi. i. Timo. ii. He refused no kynd of paynful grefe  greuous payne to apease Goddes wrath,  to reconcyle vs vnto his ce+lestiall father.Colo. i. O good Iesu, sayethe S. Bernard,Sermone quidam. howe greatly were we endetted to the,  yet dost thou paye oure dette? We haue synned,  thou arte punysshed. This is a worke w^t|out exa~ple, a grace without meryte a charite without measure.
Uerely verely not the prodicio~  betrayenge of Iudas,Note who dyd pure hrist to death. not the furye  cruell malyce of the Pharises and Bysshops, not the wycked and false witnesses, not the vnryghteous ac|cusers, not the cruell  vnmercyfull iudges dyd put Christ to death, but we our selues, our synne, our iniqui+te, our vngodlynes, our abhomina|cion, our corrupte ma~ners dyd slaye hym,  put hym to that moost cruell deth. We are they that dyd kyl him.

We soughte his deathe.Mat. xxvi. We dyd be|tray hym. We dyd falsely accuse him We nayled him vpon the Crosse.Mat. xiiii We scourged his moost blessed body.Luk. xxii. We shed his moost precious bloude. We dyd cleue asunder his moost blessed herte with a speare,Ioan. xxii oute of y^t which ra~ne both water  bloude.Esa. liii. We gaue hym Eysell  Gaull to dryncke. We scorned him, we mocked him, we dyd spit on his moost swete face. We buf+fetted hym, we brused hym, we were the Authors of all y^t tyranny, which was wrought agaynst hym. Yet for y^ loue that he bare towarde vs, dyd not he disdayne to suffer all these in tollerable paynes,i. Pet. ii. by whose passio~s  suffrynges we are perfectly made whose, by whose moost blessed bloud all oure synnes are wasshed awaye,i. Ioan. i. by whose deth, euerlasting lyfe chau~+seth abundantly vnto vs.Rom.viii. O vnme|surable kyndnes. What a loue hath God to vs, that he spared not his on|ly

sonne,Ioan. iii. but gaue hym for vs all, y^t so many as beleue in hym, maye not peryshe, but haue euerlastynge lyfe.
And as God the father gaue hys sonne Christ vnto death for our syn+nes,Rom. iiii. Eph. ii. Math. i. Luk. ii. Ioan. xiiii. Ioan. xi. Math. ix. Ioan. vii. Ioan. v. Psel. xxvi. i. Cor. i. so dyd he rayse hym vp agayne by his moost puissaunt power from death for our iustificacio~. He is oure peace, howe than can we be sadde  heuy? He is our Sauiour, howe the~ can we despayre? He is oure waye, howe than can we erre? He is oure trueth, howe than can we be decey|ued? He is our lyfe, howe tha~ can we dye? He is oure Resurreccion, howe tha~ can we slepe in synne? He is our Phisicion, how tha~ ca~ we be sycke  diseased? He is our lyght, howe than ca~ we walke in darkenes? He is our bread, howe tha~ can we be hungrye? He is oure defender, howe than can we be afearde? He is oure wisdome, howe than can we be ignorante? He is our righteousnes, howe than can

we be vnrighteous?Rom. x. Psal. xliiii i. Tim. ii. i. Ioan. ii. Col. i. He. iiii. vii i. Pet. ii. Ioan. x. Rom. viii. He is our sanc|tificacion, howe than can we be pro+phane  vnholy? He is our rede~cion howe than can we be damned? He is our rytches, howe than can we be pore? He is oure beautye, howe than can we be deformed  yll fauoured? He is our mediatour and aduocate, howe than can oure matters be vn|hearde? He is oure head, howe than can we his members perysh? He is our Bysshop  Curate of our soules howe than can we wante spirituall doctryne? He is our dore, how than can we but enter into the kyngdom of heauen? To conclude, he is altogi+ther oures,  all that euer he hathe, how than can we but sayle in a safe  quiette hauen? Howe than can we but haue all thynges prosperous  fortunate? Thus se we what an hye treasure Christ is to vs. Yf any ma~ desyreth to knowe more of Christ,  what benefites we haue receiued by

let hym read my worke of y^e Newes out of heaue~,Searche y^e Newes out of heaue~ where he shall se Christ truly  lyuyshly paynted as alone  perfecte redemer,  a plenteous and an omnisufficient sauiour for al the~ that faythfullye repente and lede a newe lyfe.
Would not all these so great com+modities  large benefytes, whiche we receyue of God y^t father thorowe Iesus Christ, moue ony christe~ hert in the worlde to be thankful, and to syng perpetuall prayses vnto God? For we haue lerned here, that al our saluacion co~meth only from God y^e father thorow Iesus Christ,Tit. iii.  that he saued vs mercifully whe~ we were loste miserablye. But let vs beholde more of Goddes kyndnesse, that we maye learne that thankes ought to be gyuen vnto hym seriously.


 The. xliiii. Chapter.
ALthough by Christ we be sette agayne at lybertye,  receyue

our manumissio~  fredome fro~ that captiuitie, wherunto we were made honde by the synne of Adam, so sone as we are regenerate  borne a new by y^e honorable Sacrament of Bap+tisme,Ioan. iii. and the holy Ghost, yet in as much as afterward thorow our fra|gilite  weakenes we fall agayne in to synne,  deserue therby also to be cast from the fauour of God,  to be dampned perpetuallye, yf God dyd not also healpe vs in this behalfe, O LORDE God, in how miserable a cas are we?Nota. What should it profytte vs, by Christ to be delyuered from that wretchednes, into the whiche Adam dyd caste vs, yf there were not also a remedy to expulse that daunger, in|to the which we cast our selues tho|rowe synne after Baptisme? Ther|fore here also dothe the goodnesse of God appere very large  bountious toward vs. For though we synne af+ter baptisms neuer so greuously, ye

doth not he streyght wayes take ven+geaunce on vs,ii. Pet. ii.  caste vs headlonge nto he fyre, as he dyd y^e au~gels, but he pacie~tly abydeth our co~uersio~,Iob. iiii.  loketh dayly whan we wyll repent, and amend, as the Prophet sayth, y^ LORDE longe abydeth vs,Esa. xxx. y^e he maye haue mercy on vs. Also the Psalmo|gra\`ph,Psa. . liiii. The LORDE is gentle  mer|cifull, pacient,  of great pitie. The LORDE is good  gentle to all men,  his re~der mercies are stretched forth vpon all his workes.Lame~t. iii. Ieremy also sai+eth, It are the mercies of the LORDE that we are not consumed. Yea he ex+citeth  storeth vs vp by his holy spi+ryte, and gyueth vs grace to repent, turne,  amende, as he sayeth by his Prophet, I wyl gyue them an herte  a new spiryte wyl I gyue in theyr in warde partes,Ezech. xi.  I wyll take away the stony herte from theyr flesh, and giue them a fleshly herte, y^e they may

walke in my preceptes, and kepe my iudgementes,  do them. And they shall be my people,  I shll be theyr God.Eze. xxxvi. Agayne, I wyll powre out vpo~ you cleane water,  ye shall be made cleane from all youre vncleannes,  from all youre Idolles wyll I make you cleane,  I wyll gyue you a new herte  a newe spiryte wyll I putte in the myddes of you,  I wyll take awaye the stony herte from the flesh,  gyue you a fleshly hert, and I wyl putte my Spiryte in the myddes of you,  I wyll make you to walke in my preceptes,  kepe and worke my iudgeme~tes,  ye shal dwel in y^e la~d y^e I gaue to your fathers,  ye shall be my people,  I shalbe your God, and I shall saue you from all youre vn|clennes.
Moreouer he styll calleth vpo~ v to come vnto him, sayenge: Turne  repente you of all youre iniquities.Eze. xviii. And youre iniquite shall worke you

spleasure.: Caste awaye from you l your wickednesses, in the whiche e haue offended,  make you a new erte  a new spirite. Wherfore wy e dye O ye house of Israell? For I yll not that any shoulde dye, sayth he LORDE GOD.Iere. iii. Retourne and ue. Agayne, it is commonlye sayde f a man leaue his wyfe, and she go|ing away marieth another husbod, hal he returne any more agayne vn o her? Shall not the woman be pol+ted  defyled? But thou hast play|d the whore with many louers, yet eturne agayne vnto me, sayeth the ORD,  I wyll receyue the. O moost were  co~fortable sayenge.i. Tim. i. O moost entle Sauyour, worthy all prayse lory and honoure.
Here maye ye se howe greatly we re bounde to God, and howe great hanckes we ought to gyue hym, se|ng that he so greatly desyreth oure elth, lyfe  saluacion,  wyllethe by

no meanes our decaye, death  dam|nacion. He is y^e gentle father, which ioyefully receyueth agayne his loste sonne,Luke. xv.  moost louyuglye enbrase the hym. He is that shepehearde, whiche bryngeth home agayne on his shoul ders, that shepe that was wandered awaye.Mat. ix. He is that Phisicion, y^e hea|leth the sycke  diseased. He is y^e Sa+uiour, which came not to call y^ righ+teous but synners vnto repentau~ce He is that helper,Mat. xi. whiche dayly cry|eth, come vnto me all ye that labour  are laden, and I shall refresh you. Seke therfore the LORDE,Esa. lv. whyle he maye be founde. Call on hym, whyle he is nygh. Let the vngodly forsake his waye, and the wycked man his thoughtes,  let hym returne to the LORDE,  he shall haue mercy on him yea but let hym not fayle to turne vnto our God. For he is bounteous  very redy to forgyue.


 The. xlv. Chapter.
FUrthermore who is able to ex|presse howe greatly we are bou~d vnto God for his diligent conserua|cion  kepynge vs?By god are we preserued from guyl. If we were not preserued  kepte of hym, into howe many euels shoulde we faull? Howe were it possible for vs to be fre from the captiuitie of Satan, to be pure from the fylthynesse of the flesshe, to be kepte harmeles from the tyranny of the world, yf God dyd not defend vs? Howe many kynde of euelles do we se dayely perpetrated  done be|fore our eyes, as theft, murder, trea|son, adultrye, fornicacion, couetous|nes, glotony, dro~ckenshyp. c. which all vndoubtedly we should lykewyse do,Nota: yf we were not preserued fro~ the~ by the goodnes of God. For the fra|gilite of nature  the pronyte vnto euell is all one in them  in vs, yf we be lefte vnto our selues. Our perdi|cion commeth of our selues but our saluacion commeth only of God,Oze. xiii. as

the Prophet sayth. Excepte y^ LORD, sayeth Esaie,Esa. i. Rom. ix. had lefte vnto vs seed, we had ben as Sodome,  we might well haue ben lykened vnto Gomor|re. Therfore seyng that God kepeth vs from theyse great enormities, we are very much bounde to gyue hym right herty thanckes.
The bene+fites of God to+ward vs.Agayne with howe many gyftes doth he endue vs dayly? What haue we, y^t is not his gyftes, yf it be good  godlye? He engraffeth in vs by hys moost holy spiryte, Fayth, hope, cha|rite, peace, ioye, pacience, longe suffe+rynge, mekenes, leuite, softenes, mo+desty, honest behauour. c. He giueth vs helth for our body. He gyueth vs spirituall gladnes for our soule. He prepareth all thynges necessarye for this our nede lyfe. He getteth fren|des for vs. He defe~deth vs from our enemies. He preserueth vs i~ all good+nes. To conclude, loke what a moost naturall father is vnto his moost en|tierlye

beloued sonne, the verye same is he vnto vs. So y^e what soeuer we haue beyng good eyther pertayning to the soule or to the body, we altogi+ther receyue it of this oure celestiall father. What great thanckes ther|fore he is worthi to haue, who percei+ueth not? S. Bernarde sayth, let vs gyue tha~ckes to our God for y^e good thi~ges y^e we do,  let vs hu~bly say to hi~ w^t Esay the Prophet.Esa. xxvi. All our wor+kes haste y^u wrought in vs O LORDE our God. Herto pertayneth the say+enge of S. Gregory: It is co~uenie~t y^t we gyue thanckes alway to God, which neuer ceseth to do wel, except he be letted  hyndred thorowe the noughtines of men. Therfore what soeuer worke y^u shalte begynne, fyrst call on God,  cease not to gyue tha~|kes, whan thou hait fynysshed it.


 The. xlvi. Chapter.
ALthough it be so, y^t all nacions of y^e world, euen from the Easte

to the West,P. xii. ought to prayse y^ name of the LORDE for his i~numerable be|nefytes, that they without desertes receyue of him dayly,We Eng+lysh men aboue all nacio~s are most bou~d to gyue God than+kes. yet I thyncke ther is no Realme thorowe out Chri+stendome, that hath so many vrgent weyghty  necessary causes to gyue God thanckes, as we Englyshe men haue at this present. To whome is it vnknowen with howe miserable cap+tiuitie we haue ben detayned  sup|pressed theyse many hundred yeares thorowe the vsurped power and gre+uous tyrany of y^c Bysshop of Rome? Who knoweth not howe greatly the consciences of Christen menne were snarled, yea  almoost slayne thorow the decrees of that Bysshop? Howe greatly was the Christian lybertye enclosed  stopped vp, so that no ma~ could enioye y^e vse of those thynges, which the word of God determined free, withoute his lycense  dispensa+cion? Howe were the singulare meri|tes

of Christes death,  the inestima+ble price of his moost precious bloud adnihilated  set at nought, and the Bysshop of Roomes pardo~s trusted vnto,  perfecte affiaunce reposed in the~ for remission of synnes  eternall saluacion? What a sorte of Hypocri+tical  supersticious workes creptin thorowe oute Christe~stome almoost, which only were beleued to be thea|lone good workes, and the true good workes, whiche are commaunded of God in his holy scriptures, vtterly neglected, despysed  set at nought? Who thought it not a more merito|rious acte to gylde an Image, than to cloth a poore naked manne? Who thought it not a better dede to ru~ne gaddynge a pylgrimage into diuers countrees for to seke dead Images, than to tary at home,  to visyte the poore members of Christ, which laye bedrede, sycke, lame, feble  impote~t. O extreme blyndnes.
Agayne what an infinite mon+res, Monckes I woulde haue sayd,  other religious parsons, and God wyll as they desyre to be called, dyd there aryse in his kyngedome? Who thoughte it not a better dede to put his chylde into an Abbay,  there to lyue ydlely, swinyshly  irreligiously pampred vp with all delicious fare, that should prouoke vnto Iewdnes, than to lette him lyue abroad in the worlde,  there to practyse some ho|nest arte  occupacion, that myghte turne to the commodite  mayntay|nance of the common weale? What blyndenes hadde inuaded this Re|alme? Dyd not we thynck it rather our du+ty to obey y^ proude Bishop of Rome than our owne natyue kynge? Dyd not we esteme his fa~tastica decrees, aboue the edictes, lawes, and actes of our own kyng? were we not more redy to followe his sensuall lustes 

beastlyke pleasures, than to obeye y^ co~madementes of our owne kynge  ruler? Into what perels woulde not we caste our selues to do y^t ram|mysh Byshop pleasure? Yea woulde God that certayne of this Realme in tymes paste had not rather had a mynde to dye for the mayntenaunce of the false vsurped power of y^t Bys|shop, than to lyue with obedient and faythfull hertes to our moost Chri|sten kynge. O LORDE God, what a blyndnes was this? where was this doctryne of Christe  his Apostle be|come, that all men should be subiecte  obedie~t to the hygh powers? This sentence of S. Paule laye buryed:Rom. xiii. Let euery soule be subiecte to y^ high powers. For there is no power, but of God. All powers are ordayned of God He therfore y^t resisteth,Sap.  resisteth the ordinaunce of God. And they y^t resist, shall take to the~ selues damna+cion. Also S. Peter:i. Pet. ii. Be subiecte to

to euerye humayne creature for the LORDES sake,The kyng supreme heade whither it be vnto the kynge as supreme head, or to the ru|lers that are sent by hym to the pu|nyshment of the euell doers, but vn|to the prayse of them that do well. The Christen prynces were not had in reuere~ce  honour as they ought. o miserable case,  detestable abusio~.


 The. xlvii. Chapter.
Behold in what lid  we Englysh men were when the Bishop of Rome ru|led in the RealmeFUrthermore what ygnorancy  blyndenes was in this Realme, concerninge the true  christe~ know+ledge? Howe many sauoured Christ aryght? Howe many walked in the streyght pathe wayes of Gods ordi|nau~ces? Howe many beleued Christ to be the alone Sauiour? Howe ma+ny trusted to be saued only by y^ me|rites of Christes death,  y^e effusion  sheddynge of his moost precious  blessed bloude? How many ranne to God alone eyther in theyr prosperi|te or aduersite? Howe many ampler|ed

Christe for theyr sufficient medsa tor  aduocate vnto God y^e father? Howe many felte the efficacye  po|wer of the true  christe~ fayth wher+by a christe~ ma~ is frelyiustified? How many could discerne the fayned and the true workes asunder? Howe ma+ny dyd know what they professed at Baptisme? Howe many had knowe+ledge what theyr Pater noster me~t,  wherfore they prayed? Howe ma|ny dyd perfectly vnderstand the ar|ticles of the Christen faythe? Howe many dyd knowe what the ceremo|nies of the chyrche mente, as holye bread  holy water and suche other? Howe many hearde the Euangicall doctryne euer preached purely and syncerly? O good Iesu, be mercyful vnto vs. If I shoulde go forth to re|herse all the abuses  all the ygnora~+cy  blyndenes, wherwith this now moost free and florysshynge Realme hath ben oppressed thys many hun|dred

yeares thorowe the tyranny of that Babilonicall stro~pet,Apoc. xvii. it woulde vndoubtedly make a worke much lo~+ger then the Iliades of Homere.
Englond is purged and made clene of her defor|mytyes.But nowe are theise enormities yea  deformities of this Realme of Englond vtterly exiled  banyshed. All false Religion is exterped  pluc+ked vp by the rootes. The miserable captiuite, wherwith we were oppres+sed in the Popes kyngdome, is tur|ned into delectable liberte. Dur con|conscie~ces are restored to theyr olde fredome. Christes deth is beleued to be a sufficient Sacrifyce for them y^e are sanctified.Heb. x. All supersticious fan+tasies inuented of ydle braynes are full godly put downe. The famous Images, wherwith the symple peo|ple co~mytted sornicacion, I meane, Idolatry, are iustly plucked downe,  conueyed oute of the waye. All the monasticall sectes haue put of theyr cowles  monstruous garmentes.

Our moost Christian kynge is now accordyng to y^e verite of Gods word  his iust  right title, recognised to be supreme head of y^e chyrch of Eng|londe nexte vnto Christ immediate|ly here in earth. He is honored of vs his subiectes, as we ought by y^e lawe of God  had in reuerence aboue all creatures mortall. Not onlye his moost noble grace, but also so many as he appoyntethe to rule ouer vs, we obey w^t all submissio~  humilite of mynd.


 The. xlviii. Chapter.
MOreouer ygnorancy  blynde+nes are exiled and banysshed. Gods lawes are manifestly declared vnto vs. So that we maye, yf we wyll, kepe his moost godlye com|maundementes. The moost sacred Byble is freely permytted to be red of euery man in the Englysh tonge. Many sauour Christ aright,  day|ly the no~ber encreaseth, thanckes be to GOD. Christ is beleued to be the

Christ is beleued to be our sufficient medi|atoure  aduocate.alv. Rom. v. The true  chri|sten fayth, whiche worketh by chari|te  is plenteous in good workes, is nowe receyued to iustify. The good workes that are appoynted in y^e ho|ly scriptures, are nowe only vsed,  put in exercyse among the faythful. What we professed, when we were baptised, many nowe knowe ryghte wel. The twelue Articles of the christe~ fayth, the LORDES prayer, cal|led y^e Pater noster,  the te~ co~mau~de+mentes are nowe rehearsed in y^e En+glyshe tonge both of yonge  olde, so that nowe all vnderstonde the~. Ma|ny of the Ecasticall ceremonies are nowe ryg well taught  know+en. To co~clude, all olde thynges are paste,  newe thynges entred into y^

game place in stead of them. And all these thynges hath God brought to passe by his derely beloued seruau~te He~ry our kynge. If his grace goeth forth, as he hath begun, he shal make such a florynshynge Realme both in spirituall  corporall goodes, bothe for the glory of God,  for the mayn|tenaunce of hys Graces publyque meale, as none shall maye be able to compare with this Realme of Eng|londe, thorowe oute Christendome. And as his moost excellent maiestye shall easely ouercome  excell in the exercyse of true godlynes all his re decessoures  leaue a memorable act vnto his successoures, moost worthy to be followed, so lykewyse maye his Grace be sure, that there is reposed  layde vp i~ store for hi~ in Gods trea+sure house the immacessible crowne of glory, which, whan his Grace shal giue ouer to nature, that moost glo+ryous kyng of all kynges shall gyue

 The. xlix. Chapter.
THus se we howe greatlye we of the Englysh nacion are bounde vnto God for the restitucion  brin+gynge agayne of the knoweledge of

his moost diuyne wyll, which so lo~ge hath ben hydde vnder the busshell of mennes tradicions. What co~digue thanckes are we able to gyue vnto him for this his i~estimable goodnes? Werelye yf euery one of vs, as Wer|gyle sayeth, had an hundred to~ges,  an hundred mouthes, yet were we not able sufficientelye to decantate, singe,  set forth his prayses. GOD grau~t vs once to be truly tha~kefull.
Nowe where are theise parsons,The aburt|saryes of Gods wor which haue so lytle pleasure in this regeneracio~  newe byrth, as I may so speke, of Gods moost blessed word  in this settynge forth agayne of y^e Euangelicall berite, oure only lyfe, helthe  saluacion? Where are these Dwles, which despisynge the moost confortable lyght of Goddes worde, chose rather continually to walke in the darkenes of mennes tradicions, than once to approche vnto this ce|lestiall lyghte? Where are these An|techristes,

which wyll neyther them selues read the Scriptures, nor yet suffer other, that woulde rede them, but to y^e vttermoost of theyr power plucke men from redynge the moost sacred Byble, the worde of lyfe, of all ioye, and spirituall consolacion?
Agaynst these wicked Papistes tho~|deth Christ in the Gospell, sayeng: Do be to you ye Scribes  Phari|ses Hypocrites,Mat. xxiii. for ye speare vp the kyngedome of heauen before men, ye do neyther enter in your selues, nor yet suffer them that come to enter. Gerely yf we do not shortely repent amende,  enhalse with enbrasynge armes this moost swete word of god we maye be sure shortely to feale the moost greuous plages of Gods wra+the faull vpon vs for our vnthancke fulnes. And as Christe sayde to cer|tayne Cities for theyr ingratitude  vnthanckefulnes. Do be to the Co|razin, wo be to the Bethsada~, for yf

y^e vertues y^e haue bene done in you,Math xi. Luke. x. had bene done in y^e citye of Cyrus  Sydo~, verely they would haue repe~+ted them of theyr synnes in tymes paste, yea  that euen in sackeclothe  asshes. Notwithstandynge it shall be more tollerable  more easye at y^e daye of iudgement to Cyrus  Sy|don, than to you. And thou Caper|naum, whiche arte exalted vnto hea+uen, thou shalte be plucked downe euen to y^e veryhel. For yf y^e myracles whiche haue bene shewed in the, had ben shewed in Sodome, it hadde re|mayned vnto this day. Notwithsta~+dynge I saye to you, it shall be more tollerable to Sodome at the day of iudgement than to the: So maye it be sayde to Englonde: Do be to the Englonde, for yf the lyghte of Gods worde, had come into other nacions so plenteously as it hath done in the verelye they woulde haue repented  receiued it ioyfully. But thou dost

neyther repent nor amende thy lyse, nor take ony pleasure in the co~ming of it. uerely it shalbe more easy at y^e daye of iudgement to Sodome and Gomorre than to the.
Let vs not therfore doubte, but yf we do not shortely repent, amend our corrupte manners,  moost ioye fully enhalse with enbrasyng armes this moost swete  confortable Gos|pell of our sauiour Iesus Christ, vn+doubtedly the fears plages of Gods wrathe wyll shortely faull vpon vs.Math  take . The Scriptures shewe manifestlye that the vengeaunce of God is not farre from vs. These benefytes, that are shewed vnto vs, declare euident+ly y^e y^e plages of god are at ha~d. This lyght of Gods trueth, whiche nowe shyneth to al me~, yf they wyl receyue it, proueth openly y^e Goddes wrathe is redy to faull vpon vs, yf we shorte+ly do not repent  amende. For this is the property of God, euen to send

before his moost holy word,Note y^ pro+perte of go in sendyng forth his word. as a mes|sanger  Embassadour to them that walke in darknes  lyue dissolutely. If they receyue it, repent,  amende theyr lyues, tha~ doth his grace and fauoure faull vpon them,  they are Gods welbeloued dearelynges, and shall wante no good thynge, as we reade of the Diniuites. But yf they obstinately resyst it,Ionas. iii. laugh the word of God to scorne,Beware  corners of Gods word vetymes sal, vi remayne in theyr olde infidilite  wickednes, tha~ doth God yse ve lyke a fearce yon, whette his swearde, bende his bow,  make redy his shaftes, which shall pearse, the bodyes of the wycked, as dartes of yron fyre whotte.


 The. L. Chapter.
BUt come of I praye you hertely  tell me, dyd not God,Gen. vii.  x. ii. whan he sawe the worlde replenysshed so abu~+dantly w^e synne, that it could be no more, send None to preach vnto the~,  to exhorte them vnto repe~tasies 

amendement of lyfe, or els synal de|struccion should chau~se vnto them yet for all thys gentlenesse of God, whiche desyred rather theyr saluacio~ than damnacio~, yf they would haue conuerted, they despysed the mooste louynge admonicion of Gods messa~+ger. They had the worde of God in derisio~. They co~tinued styll in theyr brutall  beastelyke lyuynge. They gaue them selues to eatynge, drync|kynge, banckettynge,  all kynde of carnall  volupteous lyuyng. They oppressed y^e poore people, for y^e mayn|tenaunce of theyr fleshly  insaciable lustes. To be shorte, they walked as persons full of carnall securyte, and cleane withoute all feare of GOD. But what followed this theyr wyc|ked  dissolute lyuynge,Beholde y^e end of the at hate Gods worde.  co~tempte of gods word Uerely utter destruc|cio~. For God sawe that they woulde by no meanes amende, but styll per|syste in theyr abhominacion, he repe~+ted

hym,Gen. vi. that euer he made ma~, and shortely after sent such a floude vpo~ the earth,Gen. vii. ii. Pet. ii. that it ouerflowed  drow+ned all the worlde, Nohe w^t certayne other only reserued thorowe y^e great goodnes of god. D terrible Hystory. Whose harte quakethe not for feare at the hearynge of this Historys' Cer+tes it is a terrible Hystory for the ad+uersaries of Gods worde, and for all wicked lyuers.
Wha~ the Sodomites lyued so ab hominablye,Gen. xix. ii. Pet. ii. that the uery uoyce of theyr synne came vp vnto heauen,  pearsed the diuynerares,  cryed for uengeaunce to faull vpon them, not only Abraham increaced for the~, but also Lothe preached vnto the~, exhor|tynge them to leaue theyr to muche detestable  abhominable vncle~nes,  to take the feare of God vnto the~,  the study of a pure  innocent life. But they woulde not.D abbo+nacion. For the more that Loth rebuked the~ sor theyr wic|kednes

the more pleasure had they in it.P. i. Psa. xiii. They delighted in theyr nough tynes,  reioysed wha~ they had done euell. They had no feare of God be|fore theyr eies. Yea they so lyued, as though there were no God at all. Therfore God y^e ryghteous LORDE, seynge theyr detestable purpose styll to remayne in theyr abhominable ly+uynge,  no repentaunce, was of ue|ry iustyce compelled to destroye the~ by sendynge fyre  brymstone from heauen, so that both Sodome  Go|morre with all the inhabita~tes ther o  all that euer pertayned to the~, were vtterly co~slimed with fyre and brymstone from heaue~. O dolorous spectacle,  hy fight. This is an ex+ample, as S Peter sayth, for all the~ that do vngodly.ii. Pet. ii. Nota. Oh what it is to contemne the worde of God and the true preachers therof.


 The. Li. Chapter.
AGayne whan Moses  Aaron at the co~maundement of God, preached to the Egipcians,  myssed them to lette the people of Israelgo oute of captiuite,Exo. iii. that they myghte come  do Sacrifyce to theyr LORD God, how lytle was theyr preaching regarded god plaged the~, yet would they not amende. At the laste whan he sawe none amendement in them,Gen. xiiii. dyd not he by stro~g hand delyuer the~ out of captiuitie,  drowned al theyr aduersaryes This came to passe vn+doutedly yf they would haue ben or bedie~ts to his voyce by y^e mouthe of his Prophetes, they had neuer bene plaged nor yet so finallye destroyedBeware be tymes be+ware. Let all ysers  kickers therfore y^e spurne agaynste the trueth, learne here what it is to despyse the worde of God and the faythefull preachers therof.
Moreouer as ofte as the chyldre~ of Israel dyd forsake theyr true god,

which brought them oute of y^e lorde of Egypt,  rane an whore hu~tyng after straung gods,  followed theyr owne fantasies contrary to the pre|scripte of Gods worde, God sent his Prophetes vnto them, for to admo|nysh them of theyr duty  to reduce  brynge them agayne into the true waye.D cruell murthe|rers. ii. pa. xxiiii mat. v. xxiii ii. Re. xxv. But they woulde not heare them, but persecuted them, entrea|ted them vngently, prisoned them,  neuer ceased fro~ theyr crudelite, vn|tyll they had slayne them. God ther+fore seynge howe stysseuecked  hard harted they were, sent in theyr ene|mies on euery syde, which destroyed theyr Cyties, spoyled theyr goodes, slewe innumerable,  led the residue awaye captyue for theyr disobedie~ce and ingratitude.
Christ vn|gentylly entreated.At the laste God sent vnto y^e Je|wes his owne so~ne, that they might repent, co~uerte  amend. But hewe thanckefully they receyued his com|mynge,

the Scriptures shewe more euidently than it nede here to be re|hersed. What followed? Uerely the vtter destruccion almoost of the~ all, as the Histories make me~cion.Behold the ende. The ende of them was so lame~table, yea  miserable, that no man can reade the History withoute teares and we pynge eyes. Are not all theyse terry|ble Histories for the despisers of god|des worde? Let vs not flatter oure selues nor make to much of our pain+ted ethe, as they saye. For surely y^ God, which in times paste sent ven|geaunce vpon the earth for disobey|enge  conte~nynge of his word, wyll nowe also poure oute his fearce pla|ges vpon vs, yf we repent not shorte+ly  amende. For after so great light of Gods worde, yf it be not thancke|fully receyued, obeyed  followed, co~+meth vndoubtedly alwaye a great  greuous plage, whiche is ineuitable and can not be exchewed, excepte the

amende. Let us therfore with foe|full hertes receyue the doctryne of God, feeah meanes possible to pro|  thereafter, practyse it in  wyn other me to it by out godly conuersacion. Let vs not onlye say  we are fauourers of Gods wor crake much of fayth, but let vs  soberly,Tit. ii. righteously,  godly in this present world. For to read the Scriptures, to talke of the~ to best our selues of fayth is notig to the purpose,Mark this well. excepte we indicate oure lyfe dayly accordynge to Gods worde.Ioan. xiiii He tha hath my co~maunde|mentes, sayth Christ,  epeth them he it is that loue the me.Math. vii Not eerye one that sayth to me, LORDE, LORDE shall enter into the kynge~dome of he+uen, but he that doth the wyll of my father, which is in heauen.
These thynges haue I spoken to admonyshe men of theyr dutye, that they maye not abuse this singulare

benefyte of Gods word, that is now come amonge vs, but lyue worthy y^e kyndenes of God, gyue hym righte herty thanckes,  to be haue them sel+ues, that God maye not take awaye this his inestimable benefyte fro~ vs, but rather encrease it vnto the glo|ry of his name,  the helth of our sou+les. But it wyll returne to our mat+ter, and make an ende.


 The. Lii. Chapter.
THus se we what greate causes e aue to gyue thanckes vnto God,A brefere hearfall of Gods bene+fites to+ward be: yf foe consyder hys many solde benefytes, wher with he garnyssheth vs dayly. He made vs fyrst of all not only lyke vnto his owne ymage, but also, when thorowe the synne of Ada~ we were loste and damned, he saued vs agyne freely of his great mercy by Iesus Christe. And thoughe we synne sometyme thorowe the frage|lite of humayne nature contrary to oure promyse at Baptisme, yette ir

hath mercy for vs, layd vp in store, if we faythfully repent,  amende our lyues. He preserueth vs from many greuous enormities, into the which we shoulde vndoubtedly faul head|longe, yf we were not preserued by his goodnes. He lyke a moost gentle father sedeth vs,  sendeth vs al thi|ges necessary for this indygent and poore lyfe. He appoyntethe his holy Jungell to wayte vpon vs, that we maye be oppressed with no euell. He gyuethe vs fauoure in the syghte of me~. He se~deth to vs helth both of ho|dy  soule.Ioan. xvi. He grau~tethe vs what so euer we aske in the name of his so~ne Iesus Christ. What would we haue more? Yea  that, whiche to a christe~ man would be moost acceptable and thanckefull, he hath prepared for vs an euerlastynge kyngedome. full of all ioye,Esa. lxiiii. pleasure, glory  selicite. Do herte can thyncke, no tunge can ex|presse, no eye hath sene those treasu|res,

that God hathe prepared for so many as loue hym.i. Cor. iii. Who hathe euer had so bounteous a LORDE,  so gen+tle and louinge a father?Rom. v. He loueth, where he was not loued. He enry|cheth, where he was hated. He dothe good to the~, that despysed his moost holy wyll. D burnyng charite. D in co~parable loue. D kyndenes vnspe|kable. Do we wyll we nowe reco~pe~se this excedyng bentgnite of this our bounteous  celestiall father? What doth he requyre of vs agayne? Byl|dynge of monasteries? Gaddyng on pylgrimage? Offringe vp of ca~dels? Payntynge of Tabernacles? Gyl+dynge of Images? Prayeng of long Prayers wythoute the affecte of the mynde? May verely. For he hath no nede of oure goodes,Psal. iv. as the Psalmo|graphe sayth. What than? Forsothe thanckes gyuynge. He y^e gyueth har+tye thanckes to God for the benefy|tes receyued, maketh God amendes

largely.Thankes yuyng. Note. He only desireth of his faith full people, laudes, prayses  tha~kes gyuynge. Only he desyreth that we be not vnthanckefull, nor walke vn worthye his benignitie  kyndenes. For as S. Bernarde sayth,In ca~tica Ser:  there is nothynge y^e displeaseth God so much chefely in the Chyldren of grace, as ingratitude and vnthanckefulnes. That he delyghteth so much in pray+ses  thankes gyuynge it is euide~t, seynge that he distayneth not in his holy Scrypture to call at a Scry|e, as though he should say, prayse  tha~ckes gyuynge is that, that ple|seth me,  gyueth the swete fauoure before my presence. But let vs heare the Scriptures. The Sacrifyce of prayse, saythe he, shall honoure me. And a lytle before.Psal. xlix. Offer to God the sacrifyce of prayse,  paye to y^e moost hygheste thy nowes. Caull on me in the daye of thy trouble,  I wyll de|lyuer the,  thou shalte honoure me.

Do not all these faye~ges declare ma|nifestly that the moost acceptable sa+cryfyce to God is the Sacryfyce of prayse  thanckes gyuynge? Canue therbe a greater glory gyue~ to god, than to co~fesse that all goodnes and vertu commeth only of him,  y^e ther fore al honour, laude, encomy, praise  glorye oughte to be gyuen to hym alone? Vndoubtedly the Sacrifyce of thanckes gyuynge please the God hyghly. Neyther is theyr any worke that we can do, that so hyghly exal|teth the name of God, as this Sacri+fyce of thankes gyuynge, or wherin God delyghteth more. If there had, vndoubtedly it had bene prescribed  set forth in the moost sacred Byble Dyd not all the holy Patriarches  so many as were before Christes co~|mynge offer this Sacrifyce of tha~c|kes gyuynge to God, as a thynge to to him moost welcome  acceptable? And although they also at diuers ty|mes

offered externall sacrifyces, yet were these none other thynge than a testimony  witnesse of theyr i~ward Sacrifice, which they offred in their herte, praysynge the name of oure LORDE God.Mat. xi. Luke. x. Dyd not Christe also  his Apostles, as we reade in the holy Scriptures, offer this kind of sacri+fyces to our heaue~ly father? And as they dyd thus, so in lyke manner do they exhorte vs euer to be tha~kefull to God  to syng co~tynuall prayses to his moost blessed name.Colo. iii. S. Paule sayth, what so euer ye do in worde  dede, do all thynges in the name of y^e LORDE Iesu, gyuynge thanckes to God  the father by him. Agayn: Be ye thankefull. Also in another place, gyue thanckes alwaye for all thyn|ges in the name of oure LORDE Iesu Christe to God  the father.Ephe. v. To the Hebrues also be wryteth on this ma~+ner. By hym,Heb. xiii. he meaneth Christe, do we offer the Sacryfyce of prayse all

waye to God, that is to say, y^e fruite of the lyppes, that gyue glory to his name. Thus se we how diligent the holy scripture is, for to moue vs vn|to this sacrifyce of thankes gyuing, as a thynge very pleasaunt,  much acceptable to the diuyne maieste. But lette vs heare, what S. Auste~ sayth, y^e we beynge instructed both with the holy scriptures,  also with authoryties of the aunciente Doc|tors, maye the soner be moued for to gyue god herty tha~kes at all times.


 The. Liii. Chapter.
OFfer to God,In Pl. xlix sayth he, the sacri|fyce of prayse. I maye come to myselfe, where I shall fynde that I maye offer. I maye come to my selfe, for in my selfe shall I fynde the im|molacio~  offerynge of prayse. Thy Altare is thy co~scie~ce. Offer therfore to God the Sacrifyce of prayse.Mark  We nede not take ony thought, there is no cause why we shoulde go vnto A|rabia,

to seke tra~kenfence, or to fetche the packes of y^e couetous occupyer. For god seketh of vs the sacrifyce of prayse.Luke. xix. This sacrifyce of prayse had Zacheus in his patrimony, had the widowe in her closet, had a certayne poore hostes. I knewe not what she was,ii. Re. xiii. i~ her tune. Offer thou therfore to God the sacrifyce of prayse. This is the offring,Psa. xlix. this is the sacrifyce to gyue thanckes vnto hym, of whome thou hast, what so euer good is, and thorowe whose mercye is forgyuen, what soeuer euell is thyne. Offer to God the sacrifyce of prayse, and pay to the moost hyghest thy prayers. For w^e this sauour is god delighted
Behold how this moost holy Doc+tor inculketh  beteh in styll the sa|crifyce of prayse  thanckes gyuyng we sayth, y^t we nede seke none other gyfte or present to brynge vnto god but only y^ sacrifyce of prayse of tha~c+kes gyuynge. For in that aboue al

other hath God pleasure. The Psalmograph sayth,Psal. lvi. thy vow|es, O God, are within me, whiche I shall pay vnto the, I meane prayses  thankes gyuynge vnto the. For y^u hast delyuered my soule from death,  my fete from slydynge.Psa. cxv. Agayne, I shall offer vnto the, the Sacrifyce of prayse, and caull on the name of the LORDE.Psa. xxxiii. Also in another place, I wyl magnifye the LORDE at all tymes,  his prayse shal euer be in my mouth as though he should saye, there shall no tyme passe awaye, whyther it be troublous or merye, wherin I shall not prayse y^e LORD. Both my youthe  my age shal be bent to y^e prayse of hym. Hereof may we lerne to prayse our LORDE God at euery momente.


 The. Liiii. Chapter.
THere oughte no vyce to be fur|ther from the brest of a Christe~ man, then ingratitude  vnthancke+fulnes. For as S. Bernarde fayth,In Cant Ser. .

ingratitude is the enemy of y^e soule the vtter puttynge awaye of mery|tes, the dispersion of vertues, the per+dicion  losse of benefites, the fyre y^e burneth  drieth vp the fountayne of godlynes, the dewe of mercye, and the sloudes of grace.
If we gyue oure seruauntes ony thynge, they render vnto vs ryghte herty thanckes for it. Is it not ther+fore convenient, that we be thancke+full to hym,Nota. that giueth all thinges  without whome we haue nothing y^t good is? With what forheade dare we beholde to aske and receyue ony thynge of God, and afterwarde not once to thanke hym for it? O barba+rous inhumanite. O ingratitude to much vnkynde. They that are of suche churlysh nature, are of y^e kynd of them,Psa. lxxvii which, as the Psalmograph say^the, dyd forgette the benefytes of God,  the meruayous tokens that he shewed. They were filled, yea the

were stuffed euen full, sayth God by his Prophet,  they than lyfted vp theyr herte, waxed proude,  forgat me.Oze. xiii. And therfore I am become vnto them as a Lyon,  as the Catte of y^e mountayne, that runneth so swyfte+ly. I wyll mete with the~ as a Beare that hathe loste her yonge ones,  I wyll breake asunder theyr obstinate harte. Yea I wyll deuour them as a Lyon, and the beast of the felde shall teare them on peces. O terible thre|tenynge for the ingrate  vntha~cke+full persons. This wyll surely come to passe, yf we put not awaye our in gratitude  vnthanckefulnes.Psal. cxliiii Titus. i. For y^ LORDE is faythfull in all his wor|des,  can not lye, in asmuch as he is the selfe trueth.


 The. Lv. Chapter.
THerfore yf we entende to haue God the father a beneficiall fa|tr to vs,  his sonne Iesus Christ rcifull Sauiour, lette vs in all

thynges gyue thanckes to God at all tymes, yea and that not only in prosperitie but also in aduersitie,Iob. i. as the holy man Iob dyd, sayenge: The LORDE gaue it,  the LORDE hath ta+ken it awaye, as it pleased y^e LORDE so is it come to passe, blessed be the name of the LORDE. Let vs watch  praye that we faull not into tentaci+on. Let vs flye to God at all tymes with precordiall obsecracions  her|ty requestes.Mat. xxvi Let our prayers be con+tinuall. Let the~ procede fro~ a fayth|full  charitable harte.In exhor+tacion to prayer  thankes geuynge. Let vs aske all thynges accordyng to the wyl of GOD, yea and that in the name of Christe. Lette vs in all our prayers seke the glorye of God, the auaunce|ment of his moost blessed worde, and y^e helth of our owne soules. Let vs pray for y^e preseruacion of y^ kynges moost excellent maieste,  for the pro+sperous successe of his intierly belo|ued sonne Edward our Prynce. 

moost angelyke Impe. Let vs pray for all the Lordes spirytuall  tem|porall, speciallye those that haue the regiment of the publyque weale vn|der the Kynges graces highnes.Col. iiii Let vs pray for the ministers of Goddes worde, that they maye freely speake the trueth of Christes Gospell, as it beco~meth them. Let vs praye for all me~ vniuersally, chefely for the inha|bita~tes of this Realme of Englond, that they maye all beare a faythfull harte hothe towarde God and oure kynge. To co~clude, let vs praye that the wyll of God maye be fulfylled in all thynges.
Whan we haue thus prayed, lette vs all tymes gyue thanckes to God for his benefytes. So shall it come to passe, y^e he shall not only not turne awaye his kyndenes from vs, but al+so encrease it dayely vnto the great consolacion and conforte of vs all.
Yf this thynge shall come to passe

that we both praye feruently, and a so gyue thanckes to God herye,  shall not a lytle reioyse that I haue taken the labour  payne in compy|lynge this pathewaye vnto Prayer, yea it shall encourage me hereafter to attempte other enterpryses of no lesse importaunce and vtilite.
Which thynge (moost gentle Rea|der) that it maye come to passe, pray for me vnto oure LORD God, that he maye synge that thynge in me, whiche he hath begunne, vnto the glory of his moost blessed name,  promocion of his moost godly word, and the profyt  edificaci+on of his moost ho+ly  catholyke Chyrche.
