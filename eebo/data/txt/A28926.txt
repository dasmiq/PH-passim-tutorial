THE SONG OF
Solomon made in
praise of Christ,
and his Church.

CHAPTER I.
The Church speaketh to Christ.
LEt him kisse me with the kisses of his mouth,
for thy love is better then wine.

LEt him with kisses of his mouth
to kisse me now incline,
For sure thy love farre better is
then is the finest wine.

2 Because of the savour of thy good oynt|ments,
thy name is as oyntment powred forth,
therefore do the virgins love thee.

2
Because that of thine ointments ood
the savour sweet doth prove,
Thy Name as ointment forth is powr'd
thee therefore virgins love.

3 Draw me, we will run after thee: the
King hath brought me into his chambers:

3
Do thou me draw and then anone
we after thee will run:
The King himself he hath me now
his chambers brought within.


We will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will
remember thy love more then wine: the upright
love thee.

We'l in thee glade be and rejoice,
thy love also will wee
Remeber more then sinest wine,
the upright do love thee.

4 I am black, but comely, (O ye daughters
of Ierusalem) as the tents of Kedar, as the
curtains of Solomon.

4
O Salems daughters black I am,
but yet a comely one
As tents of Kedar, and ev'n as
curtains of Solomon.

5 Look not upon me because I am black, be|cause
the Sun hath looked upon me.

5
Upon me look not ye, because
I black do seem to be,
Because the Sun hath with his beames
long looked upon me.

My mothers children were angry with mee,
they made me the keeper of the vineyards, but
mine own vineyard have I not kept.

My mothers children wroth with me
the vineyards keeper made,
But I my self have not at all
so kept mine own vineyard.


6 Tell me (O thou whom my soul loveth)
where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock
to rest at noon:

6
O thou, whom dearly loves my soul,
I pray thee tell me soon
Where thou dost feed, and where thou makst
thy flock to rest at noon.

For why should I be as one that turneth aside
by the flocks of thy companions?

For why should I be any way
as one that turnes aside
By flocks of thy companions
where ev'r they do abide?


CHRIST.
7 If thou know not, (O thou fairest among
women) go thy way forth by the footsteps of
the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds
tents.

7
O fairest one if thou not know,
by the flocks footsteps go,
And do thou feed thy kids beside
the shepherds tents also.

8 I have compared thee, O my love, to a
company of horses in Pharaohs chariots.

8
My love unto a company
I have compared thee,
Of horses in the chariots
that for King Pharo be.


9 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jew|els,
thy neck with chains of gold.
10 We will make thee borders of gold with
studs of silver.

9
With jewell rows thy cheeks are fair,
with chaines of gold thy neck:


10
Of gold we borders will thee make
which silver studs do deck.



The Church.
11 While the king sitteth at his table, my
spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.
12 A bundle of myrrhe is my welbeloved un|to
me;

11
While at his table sits the King
my spiknard sends it smell:


12
Of mirrhe a bundle unto me
is my beloved well.

He shall ly all night betwixt my breasts.
13 My beloved is unto me, as a cluster of
Camphire, in the vineyards of Engedi.

Betwixt my breasts hee'le lie all night


13
My welbelov'd's to me
As of Engedies vineyards rare,
the Camphires clusters be



CHRIST.
14 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold,
thou art fair, thou hast doves eyes.


14
O do behold, most fair thou art
ev'n thou my love so rare,
Behold of Doves the eyes thou hast,
and thou art very fair.



The Church.
15 Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea
pleasant: also our bed is green.
16 The beams of our house are cedar, and
our rafters of fire.

15
Lo, pleasant fair thou art my love,
green also is our bed:


16
Beams of our house they cedars are,
of firre our rafters made.




CHAPTER II.

CHRIST.
I Am the rose of Sharon, and the lilly of the
valleyes.
2 As the lilly among thornes, so is my love
among the daughters.

I'M Sharons rose, the lilly als
that valleyes growes along:


2
As lillies among thornes, my love
so daughters is among.



The Church.
3 As the apple tree among the trees of the
wood, so is my beloved among the sons.

3
As th apple tree among the trees
is of the wood so throng,

So likewise my Beloved is,
the sons of men among.

 I sate down under his shadow with great
delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.

Under his shadow I sate down
with great delight there plac't,
And there his fruit which pleasant is
was sweet unto my taste.

4 He brought me to the banqueting house,
and his banner over me was love.

4
Unto the house of banqueting
to come he did me move
His banner that was over me
was altogether love.

5 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with
apples; for I am sick of love.
6 His left hand is under my head, and his
right hand doth embrace me.

5
Me sick of love with flagons stay,
with apples me solace:


6
Under my head his left hand is,
his right me doth embrace.

7 I charge you, O ye daughters of Ieru|salem,
by the Roes, and by the Hinds of the
field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love
till he please.

7
By Roes, field Hindes, O Salems maids,
I charge you that ye cease

o stir or yet at all awake
my love, untill he please.

8 The voice of my beloved! behold, he co|eth
leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon
e hils.

The voice of my Belov'd! behold!
he cometh thus anone
pon the mountains leaping high
and skipping hills upon.

9 My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart:
hold, he standeth behinde our wall, he looketh
th at the windows, shewing himself through
e lattesse.

He's like a Roe or Hart that's young,
he stands behind our wall,
t windowes he looks forth, himself
he shews through lattesse all.

10 My beloved spake, and said unto me,
se up my love, my faire one, and come away.
11 For lo, the winter is past, the raine is over
d gone.

Then my Belov'd said, Rise my love,
away come my fair One:


For lo the winter it is past,
the rain is ov'r and gone.

12 The flowers appear on the earth, the time
he singing of birds is come, and the voice of
turtle is heard in our land.


12
The flowers upon the earth appear,
of singing of the bird
The time is come; the Turtles voice
within our land is heard.

13 The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs
and the vines with the tender grape give a good
smell. Arise, my love, my faire one, and come
away.

13
The fig tree her green figs puts forth,
vines with grapes tender they
Do sweetly smell; arise my love
my fair one come away.



CHRIST.
14 O my dove that art in the clefts of the
rock, in the secret places of the stairs,

14
O thou my dove that art ev'n now
in clifts within the rock,
Within the secret places of
the staires where thou dost lurk.

Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy
voice, for sweet is thy voice, and thy counte|nance
is comely.

Let thou me see thy countenance,
thy voice let thou me hear,
For sweet thy voice is, and also
thy countenance is clear.

15 Take us the Foxes, the little foxes that
spoile the vines: for our vines have tender
grapes.


15
Do ye for us the foxes take,
foxes that little be
That spoile the vines, for tender grapes
our vines have, as ye see.



The Church.
16 My beloved is mine, and I am his: he
eedeth among the lillies.

16
My Welbeloved sure is mine,
and I am his indeed,
Among the lillies smelling sweet
he pleasantly doth feed.

17 Vntill the day break, and the shadowes
lee away: turn my beloved, and be thou like a
Roe, or a young Hart, upon the mountains of
Bether.

17
Untill day break and shads flee hence,
turn my belov'd, and be
Thou like a Roe, or Hart that's young
on Bethers mountains hie.




CHAPTER III.
BY night on my bed I sought him whom my
soul loveth: I sought him, but I found
im not.

BY night I did upon my bed
him seek with all my minde
VVhom my soul loveth; I him sought,
but him I did not find.


2 I will rise now, and go about the citie in
the streets, and in the broad wayes I will seek
him whom my Soul loveth:

2
I will now rise, and in the streets
about the city move,
And in the broad wayes I will seek
him whom my soul doth love.

I sought him, but I found him not.
3 The watchmen that goe about the city found
mee: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my
Soul loveth.
I sought him, but I found him not,

3
The Cities watchmen me
Did find; I said then did ye him
whom my soul loveth see?

4 It was but a little that I passed from them,
but I found him whom my Soul loveth;

4
It but a little was that I
from them did passe away,
But I him whom my soul doth love
did find without delay:

I held him, and would not let him goe, untill
I had brought him into my mothers house, and
into the chamber of her that conceived me.

I held and would not let him go,
untill that by me he
Was to her house and chamber brought
that had conceived me.


5 I charge you, O ye daughters of Ierusa|lem,
by the Roes, and by the Hindes of the field,
that ye stir not up, nor awake my love till hee
please.

5
O Salems daughters I you charge
by Roes, field Hindes ye cease
To stir or yet for to awake
my love untill he please.

6 Who is this that cometh out of the wil|dernesse
like pillars of smoake, perfumed with
myrrhe and frankincense, with all powders of
the merchant.

6
Of smoak like pillars who is this
that comes from wildernesse,
Perfum'd with frankincense and mirrhe,
all merchands powders als.

7 Behold his bed, which is Solomons: three|score
valiant men are about it, of the valiant of
Israel.

7
Behold, his bed is Solomons,
threescore men valiant all
About it are, of those that are
the valiant of Isra'l.

8 They all hold swords, being expert in war,
Every man hath his sword upon his thigh, be|cause
of fear in the night.

8
Expert in war, they all do hold
swords in their hands most bright,

ach man his sword hath on his thigh,
because of fear by night.

9 King Solomon made himself a charet of
the wood of Lebanon.
10 He made the pillars thereof of silver, the
bottom thereof of gold,

9
Of Lebanons wood Solomon
himself a charet made;


10
It's pillars made of silver were,
with gold the bottome laid:

The covering of it of purple, the midst there|of
being paved with love, for the daughters of
Ierusalem.

The cov'ring of it purple was,
the midst of it for them
Was pav'd with love, that daughters were
of his Jerusalem.

11 Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and
behold King Solomon,

11
Oye that Zions daughters are
do ye go forth anone,
And do ye with great reverence
behold king Solomon.

With the crown wherewith his mother crow|ned
him in the day of his espousals, and in the day
of the gladnesse of his heart.

With crown wherewith his mother him
crown'd in his spousals day,

And in the day his heart was fill'd
with gladenesse ev'ry way.



CHAPTER IV.

CHRIST.
BEhold, thou art faire, my love, behold thou
art faire, thou hast doves eyes within thy
locks:

BEhold my love thou art most fair
behold fair is thy skin,
The pure and chast eyes of the Dove
thou hast thy locks within:

Thy haire is as a flock of goats, that appear
from mount Gilead.

Thy haire that is upon thy head,
is also very near
Like to a flock of goats that from
mount Gilead do appear.

2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep, that
are even shorn which came up from the washing,
whereof every one beare twins, and none is barren
among them.

2
Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep,
ev'n shorn from washing gone,
Whereof each one bare twins, and them
among is barren none.

3 Thy lips are like a threed of scarlet, and
thy speach is comely: thy temples are like a prece
of a pomegranate within thy locks.


3
Thy speach is comely, and thy lips
like scarlet threed we see,
Within thy locks thy temples like
piece of pomgranats be.

4 Thy neck is like the tower of David, builded
for an armory, whereon there hang a thousand
bucklers, all shields of mighty men.

4
Thy neck is like King Davids tower,
built for an armorie,
Whereon a thousand bucklers hang,
mens shields that mighty be.

5 Thy two breasts are like two young Roe
that are twins, which feed among the lillies.

5
Thy breasts in number two are like
unto two Roes indeed
That young are, and are also twins
which 'mong the lillies feed.

6 Vntill the day break, and the shadows flee
away, I will get me to the montaine of myrrhe,
and to the hill of frankincense.

6
Untill the day most clearly break
and shaddows flee from hence;
I'le get me to thee mounts of Myrrhe,
and hill of frankincense.

7 Thou art all fair, my love, there is no spot
in thee.
8 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse,
with me from Lebanon:


7
Thou art all fair my love, there is
no spot at all in thee:


8
Spouse come with me from Lebanon
from Lebanon with me

Look from the top of Amana, from the top
of Shenir and Hermon, from the Lyons dens,
from the mountains of the Leopards.

Look from the tops of Amana,
Shenir and Hermon hie,
From Lions dens, from mountaines great
where Leopards there be.

9 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my
spouse, thou hast ravished my heart, with one of
thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.

9
My heart thou ravish'd, sister, spouse,
my heart thou in effect
Hast ravish'd with one of thine eyes,
with one chain of thy neck.

10 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse,
how much better is thy love then wine? and the
smell of thine oyntments then all spices.

10
How fair's thy love, my sister spouse?
how better much then wine
Is this thy love! thine ointments smell
more then all spices fine!

11 Thy lips, O my spouse drop as the hon

comb, hony and milk are under thy tongue, and
the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Le|banon.

11
Thy lips, Spouse, drop as hony comb,
the honey milk excell
Under thy tongue; as Lebanon
thy garments they do smell.

12 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse:
a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.

12
My sister spouse a garden is,
which is inclosed well,
A spring shut up, a fountain als
whereon is set a seal.

13 Thy plants are an orchard of Pomegra|nates,
with pleasant fruits, Camphire, with
Spikenard.

13
Thy plants an orchard are also
ev'n of pomegranates rare,
With pleasant fruits, the Camphire sweet
and Spiknard likewise are:

14 Spikenard and Saffron, Calamus and Cy|namon,
with all trees of frankincense, Myrrhe,
and Aloes, with all the chief spices:

14
Spiknard, Saffron, and Calamus,
and Cynamon with all,
Trees of franklncense, Aloes, Mirrhe,
all spices principall.


15 A fountaine of gardens, a well of living
waters, and streams from Lebanon.

15
A fountain for to water well
the gardens all anone
A well of living waters als
and streames from Lebanon.



The Church.
16 Awake, O North-wind, and come thou
South, blow upon my garden, that the spices
thereof may flow out;

16
O north wind, do thou now awake,
and come thou south about,
Upon my garden blow; that so
its spices may flow out:

Let my beloved come into his garden, and
cat his pleant fruits.

Let him that my beloved is
come to his garden sweet,
That he his fruits that pleasant are
may with contentment eat.




CHAPTER V.

CHRIST.
I Am come into my garden, my sister, my
spouse, I have gathered my Myrrhe with my
spice,

MY sister and my spouse, I am
my garden come into,
I carefully have gathered
my mirrhe and spice also.


I have eaten my hony comb with my honey,
I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O
friends, drink, yea drink abundantly, O be|loved!

I hony comb with hony ate,
my wine, milk, drunk have I,
Eat, O ye friends, drink O Belov'd;
yea, drink abundantly.



The Church.
2 I sleep, but mine heart waketh: it is the
voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying,

2
I sleep securely but my heart
doth wake both night and day,
It is the voice of my Belov'd
that knocking thus doth say,

Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my
undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and
my locks with the drops of the night.

My Sister, Love, Dove, undefil'd,
now open to me right,
For filled is my head with dew,
my locks with drops of night.

3 I have put off my coat, how shall I put it
on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile
them?

3
I have put off my coat, how shall
I put it on a while?
I washed also have my feet
how shall I them defile?


4 My beloved put in his hand by the hole o
the door, and my bowels were moved for him.

4
By of the door the hole his hand
my Welbelov'd put in,
And for him then my bowels all
were moved me within.

5 I rose up to open to my beloved, and my
hands dropped with Myrrhe, and my fingers
with sweet smelling Myrrhe, upon the handles o
the lock.

5
To open to my love I rose,
my hands with myrrhe did drop,
My fingers with sweet smelling myrrhe
on handles of the lock.

6 I opened to my beloved, but my beloved
had withdrawn himself, and was gone:

6
To my Belov'd I op'ned then,
but my Belov'd alone
Withdrawn himself had farre away,
and from the door was gone:

My soul failed: when he spake I sought him
but I could not finde him: I called him, but
he gave me no answer.

My soul it failed when he spake,
I after him did crave,
But could not find him, I him call'd,
but he no answer gave.


7 The watchmen that went about the citie,
found me, they smote mee, they wounded me,
the keepers of the walls took away my vaile
from me.

7
The cities watchmen found me then,
me smot, me wounded they,
The keepers of the wals they took
my vail from me away.

8 I charge you, O daughters of Ierusalem,
if ye finde my beloved, that ye tell him, that I
am sick of love.

8
O daughters of Jerusalem
I charge you from above,
If my Belov'd ye find, that yee
him tell, I'm sick of love.


The Daughters of Ierusalem.
9 What is thy beloved more then another
beloved, O thou fairest among women? what
is thy beloved more then another beloved, that
thou dost so charge us?

9
O fairest, among women thou
what's thy Beloved more?
What is he more then others are,
that thou dost charge so sore?


The Church.
10 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest
among ten thousand.
11 His head is as the most fine gold, his
looks are bushie and black as a raven.


10
Both white and rudy's my Belov'd,
chief among thousands ten:


11
His head's as gold, his bushy locks
are black as is a rav'n.

 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the
rivers of waters, washed with milk and fit|ly
set.

12
His eyes are as the eyes of doves
that by the rivers sit,
They washed also are with milk
and they are fitly set.

13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet
flowres: his lips like lillies, dropping sweet
smelling myrrhe.

13
His cheeks are as the spices bed,
as flowers that sweet excell,
His lips like lillies droping Myrrhe,
that hath the sweetest smell.

14 His hands are as gold rings set with the
Berill: His belly is as bright ivory, overlaid
with Saphires.

14
His hands as goldrings als are set
with Berill richly made,
His belly as bright ivory is
with Saphires overlaid.

15 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon
sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Leba|non,
excellent as the Cedars.


15
His legs like Marble pillars are,
on fine gold sockers set;
His count'nance is as Lebanon,
as Cedars passing great.

16 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is alto|gether
lovely: This is my beloved, and this is my
friend, O daughters of Ierusalem.

16
Most sweet his mouth is, yea he is
most lovely altogether:
This my Belov'd, and this my Friend
is, O thou Salems daughter.




CHAPTER VI.
The Daughters of Ierusalem.
WHether is thy beloved gone? O thou fai|rest
among women, whether is thy belo|ved
turned aside? that we may seek him with
thee.

O Whither's thy Beloved gone,
of women all most fair?
O whither turn'd, that we with thee
may seek him, now declare?


The Church.
2 My beloved is gone down into his garden,
to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and
to gather lillies.

2
Into his garden my Belov'd
to beds of spices rare,

To feed in gardens is gone down
to gather lillies there.

3 I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mines
be feedeth among the lillies.

3
My Welbeloveds I am all,
and my Belov'd Indeed
Is likewise mine: and now he doth
among the lillies feed.



CHRIST.
4 Thou art beautifull, O my love as Tirzah
comely as Ierusalem, terrible as an army with
banners.

4
My love as Tirza beautifull
as Salem comely so
Thou art; as one host terrible
that doth with banners go.

5 Turne away thine eyes from me for they
have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats
that appear from Gilead.

5
From me thine eyes turn thou away,
for they me overcome,
Thy hair is as a flock of goats
from Gilead that do come.

6 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go
up from the washing, whereof every one bea|reth
twins, and there is not one barren among
them.


6
Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep,
which go from washing throng:
Eacl one bears twins, and there is not
one barren them among.

7 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples
within thy locks.

7
The temples also of thine head
within thy locks that ly,
As of a pomegtanate a piece
do seem right pleasantly.

8 There are threescore Queens, and foure|score
Concubines, and Virgins without num|ber.

8
Though threescore of fair queens there be,
and concubines fourscore,
And virgins als them to attend,
ev'n without number more.

9 My dove, my undefiled is but one: she is
the only one of her mother, she is the choice one
of her that bare her:

9
My Dove my undefild's but one,
she of her mother ale
Is th'onely one, and she the choise
is of her that her bare.

The daughters saw her, and blessed her yea,
the Queens and the Concubines and they praised
her.


The daughters of the land her saw,
and blessed her likewise,
Yea ev'n the Queens and Concubines
and they als did her praise.

10 Who is she that looketh foorth as the
morning, fair as the moon clear as the sun, and
terrible as an army with banners?

10
Who's she as morning that looks forth,
fair as the Moon, and clear
As is the sun, and armies as
that dreadfull banners bear.

11 I went down into the garden of nuts, to
see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether
the vine flourished, and the pomegranates
budded.

11
I down to the Nut-garden went
the valleys fruits to see:
To see if vines were flourih'd, and
pomegranates budded be.

12 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me
like the chariots of Amminadab.

12
Or ever then I was aware,
my soul i at the last
Like charets of Aminadab
made me to make great hast.

13 Return, return, O Shulamite, return, re|turn,
that we may look upon thee:


13
Return, return O Shulamite,
return, return to me:
That we with gladnesse great of heart
may so now look on thee;

What will ye see in the Shulamite? as it were
the company of two armies.

What will ye in the Shulamite
with great contentment see?
Ev'n such a sight as if it were
two Armies companie.




CHAPTER VII.
HOw beautifull are thy feet with shoes, O
Princes daughter, the joynts of thy thighs
are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cun|ing
work-man.

HOw beatifull thy feet with shoes
O Princes daughter are!
Joints of thy thighs are jewels like
wrought by a work-man rare.

2 Thy navell is like a round goblet, which
wanteth not licour: thy belly is like an heap of
wheat, set about with lillies.

2
Thy navel's like a goblet round,
which liquor wanteth not:
Thy belly's like an heap of wheat,
with lillies set about.

3 Thy two breasts are like two young Roes,
that are twins.

4 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory: thine eyes
like the fish pooles in Heshbon, by the gate of
Bathrabbim:

3
Thy breasts are like two twin young Roes:

As ivory tower is set

4
Thy neck, thine eyes like Heshbons pools
hard by Bathrabbims gate.

Thy nose is as the towre of Lebanon, which
looketh toward Damascus.

Thy nose it is ev'n like the towre
that is in Lebanon,
Which toward all the city of
Damascus looketh down.

5 Thine head upon thee is like Carmell, and
the haire of thine head like purple, the King is
held in the galleries.

5
Thy head on thee is Carmel like,
als of thine head the hair
Is Purple like, the King is held
in galleries most rare.

6 How faire, and how pleasant art thou, O
Love, for delights!
7 This thy stature is like to a palme tree, and
thy breasts to clusters of grapes.

6
O love how art thou for delights
both pleasant and how fair!



Thy stature's like palme trees, thy breasts
they like grapes clusters are.


8 I said, I will go up to the palme tree,
I will take hold of the boughs thereof,

8
I did then say that I go up
unto the palme tree wold,
Yea of the boughs thereof I will
with all my force take hold.

Now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of
the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples.

Now also shall thy breasts all be
as clusters of the vine,
And of thy nose the pleasant smell
like apples that are fine.

9 And the roofe of thy mouth like the best
wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly,
causing the lips of those that are asleep, to
speak.

9
Roof of thy mouth like best wine is
that sweetly down doth go
For my Belov'd, and sleepers lips
doth cause to speak also.

10
I my Beloveds am, and his

11
Come my Belov'd, unto the field,

Let us lodge in the villages.
12 Let us get up early to the vineyards, let

12
Let us lodge in the villages:
Up early get to be
At vineyards, if so that the vines
do flourish let us see:

Whether the tender grapesappear, and the
pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee
my loves.

Ev'n whether tender grapes appear,
and pomegranates bud forth,
There surely will I give to thee
my loves of greatest worth.

3 The mandraks give a smell, and at our

and old which I have laid up for thee, O my

Both new and old, which I laid up,

O That thou wert as my brother that sucked
the breasts of my mother, when I should
find thee without,

O That thou as my brother wert
that of my mother kind
Did suck the breasts, even at what time
I thee without should find.

I would kisse thee, yet I should not be de|spised.
2 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my
mothers house, who would instruct me:

2
I would thee kisse, yet not be loth'd
Yea I would thee conduct,
And bring thee to my mothers house
who would me there instruct.

I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of
the juice of my pomegranate.
3 His left hand should be under my head:
nd his right hand should embrace me.

3
 would thee cause drink spiced wine
of my pomegranats juice:
Under my head his left hand laid,
his right should me embrace.

4 I charge you, O daughters of Ierusalem,
hat ye stirre not up, nor awake my love untill
he please.


4
O daughters of Jerusalem,
I charge you that you cease
To stir up or awake my love,
and that untill he please.


CHRIST.
5 Who is this that cometh up from the wil|dernesse,
leaning upon her beloved?

5
Who is this from the wildernesse
that comes up by and by?
And thus on her Beloved One
doth leaning still rely?

I raised thee up under the apple tree: there
thy mother brought thee foorth, there she brought
thee foorth that bare thee.

Under the aple tree I thee 
did raise up being there,
Thy mother there thee did bring sorth,
she brought forth that thee bare.



Iewish Church.
6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal
upon thine arme: For love is strong as death,
jealousie is cruell as the grave:

6
Me as a seal upon thine heart
as seal on arme m'ingrave:
For love's as death strong, jealousie
is cruell as the grave.

The coals thereof are coals of fire, which
hath a most vehement flame.

7 Many waters cannot quench love, neith
can the flouds drown it:

7
The coals there of are coals of fire,
which hath a vehement flame:
The waters great, love can not quench
nor floods can drown the same.

If a man would give all the substance of 
house for love, It would utterly be contemned

If of his house the substance all
a man for love to buy
Would gladely give, yet would it be
contemned utterly.

8 We have a little sister, and she hath 
breasts, what shall we do for our sister, in 
day when she shall be spoken for?

8
We have a little sister, which
no breasts hath lesse or more,
What shall we for her do the day

9 If she be a wall, we will build upon her
palace of silver: and if she be a door, we 
inclose her with boards of Cedar.

9
If he a wall be, we'l on her
a palace build of silver;
If she a door be, we her will

10 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers
then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.

CHRIST.
11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon,
he let out the vineyard unto keepers:

11
At Baal-Hamon a vineyard
king Solomon had set;
The vineyard unto keepers he
for profite out had let.

Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring
a thousand pieces of silver.

Of those his servants evry one
for the fruit of the vine
A thousand pieces was to bring
of silver that was fine.

12 My vineyard which is mine, is before me:
thou (O Solomon) must have a thousand, and
those that keep the fruit thereof, two hundred.

12
My vineyard mine before me is,
thou must O Solomon
A thousand have; who keep its fruits
two hundred live upon,


13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, th
companions hearken to thy voice, cause me 
hear it.

13
O thou that in the gardens fair
most pleasantly dost dwell,
Companions hearken to thy voice,
cause me to hear it well.

14 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou lik

Or unto a young Hart that doth
on hills of spices go.





The Song of Moses at the Red Sea,
after God had drowned Pharao
and his whole hoast.
EXODUS 15. 1.
I Will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed
gloriously; the horse and his rider h
he thrown into the sea.

I To the Lord will sing, for he
triumph'd hath gloriously;
The horse he and his rider als
hath thrown into the sea.

2 The Lord is my strength and song, and 
is become my salvation: he is my God, and I 
prepare him an habitation;


2
The Lord my strength is and my song,
and he is my salvation,
He is my God, and I'le prepare
for him an habitation.

My fathers God, and I will exalt him.
3 The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is
is Name.

He is my fathers God, and I
will high exalt his fame:


3
The Lord he is a man of warre,
JEHOVAH is his Name.

4 Pharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast
nto the sea: his chosen captains also are drown|d
in the Red sea.

4
He Pharos charets and his hoast
hath cast into the sea:
Now in the red sea also drown'd
his chosen captains be.

5 The depths have covered them, they sank
nto the bottome as a stone.

The fearfull depths they likewise have,
them covered eachone,
nto the bottom headlongs they
then sank as doth a stone.

6 Thy right hand, O Lord is become glori|us
in power; thy right hand, O Lord, hath dash|d
in pieces the enemy.


6
Thy right hand Lord it is become
in power glorious all,
Thy right hand Lord the enemy
hath dah'd in pieces small.

7 And in the greatnesse of thine excellencie
thou hast overthrown them that rose up against
thee; thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consu|med
them as stubble.

7
Who 'gainst thee rose them thou ov'rthrew,
in great excellency,
Thy wrath thou sentest forth which them
consum'd as stubble dry.

8 And with the blast of thy nostrils, the wa|ters
were gathered together: the floods stood up|right
as an heap, and the depths were congealed
in the heart of the sea.

8
The waters at thy nostrils blast,
together gathred were:
Floods stood as heaps, in heart of sea,
the depths congeal'd were there.

9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will over|take,
I will divide the spoile: my lust shall be sa|tisfied
upon them:

9
The en'my said, I will pursue,
I'le overtake anone,
I'le part the spoile; my lust shall be
them satisfi'd upon;


I will draw my sword, my hand shall de|stroy
them.
10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea
covered them, they sank as lead in the mighty
waers.

I'le draw my sword, my hand it shall
destroy them all indeed:


10
Thy wind blew, seas them covd, they in
great waters sank as lead:

11 Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongst
the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holinesse,
fearfull in praises, doing wonders?

11
Who's like thee Lord among the gods
who's like thee glorious
In holinesse, fearfull in praise
and doing wonders thus?

12 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the
earth swallowed them.
13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the
people which thou hast redeemed:

12
Thy right hand then thou stretched out,
earth swallow'd them at last.


13
In mercy thou the folk ledst forth
which thou redeemed hast:

Thou hast guided them in thy strength unto
hy holy habitation.
14 The people shall hear, and be afraid:
orrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of
Palestina.

Thou hast them to thy holy house
in thy strength guided well.

14
Men shall hear, fear, grief shall them seiz
in Palestine that dwell:

15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed:
the mighty men of Moah trembling shall take
hold upon them: all the inhabitants of Canaan
shall melt away.

15
The Dukes of Edom then amaz'd,
strong Moab trembling shall
On them take hold, the Cananites
they melt away shall all.

16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them, by
the greatnes of thine arm they shall be as still as
a stone, till thy people passe over,

16
By greatnesse of thine arm strong
fear, dread, shall on them fall,
They shall be still ev'n as a stone
till passe thy people all.

O Lord, till the people passe over, which thou
hast purchased.

O Lord till that the people do
passe ov're with great renown,
Which thou by thine Almighty hand
hast purchas'd as thine own.

17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them
in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place
O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to
dwell. in.


17
In hill of thine inheritance
Lord thou shalt bring them well,
And plant them in the place which thou
hast made for them to dwell.

In the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hand
have established.
18 The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

O Lord ev'n in the Sanctuary
which thy hand stablish'd all:


18
The Lord for ever and also
for ever reigne he shall.

19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his
chariots, and with his horsemen into the sea, and
the Lord brought again the waters of the sea,
upon them:

19
For Pharos horse with charets went
and horsmen in the sea,
The Lord again sea waters brought
upon them fearfully.

But the children of Israel went on dry land in
the midst of the sea.

But those that were the children then
of Israel by discent,
They in the midst of all the sea
on dry land safely went.




The Song of Moses a little before
his death. DEUT. 32.

The Preface.
GIve ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak;
and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.

O Ye the heavens that are high
do ye to me give ear,
The words that from my mouth proceed
O earth now do thou hear.

2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my
speech shall distill as the dew, as the small rain
upon the tender herb, and as the showres upon
the grasse.

2
My doctrine as the rain shall drop,
my speach as dew shall passe,
As small rain on the tender herb,
and showrs upon the grasse.

3 Because I will publish the name of the
Lord: ascribe ye greatnesse unto our God.

3
Because I surely publish will
the Name of God the Lord,
Ye greatnesse to our God therefore
ascribe with one accord.



The first Part.
4 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for
all his wayes are judgement: a God of truth,
and without iniquity, just and right is he.


4
He is the rock, his work's persite,
his wayes all judgement be;
A God of truth, void of all sin,
most just and right is he.

5 They have corrupted themselves, their
spot is not the spot of his children: they are 
perverse and crooked generation.

5
Their spot is not his childrens spot,
themselves corrupt'd they far,
A crooked generation
and a perverse they are.

6 Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish
people and unwise? is not be thy father that
hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and
established thee?

6
Unwise people, do ye requite
the Lord thus? Is not he
Thy father, buyer? Hath he not
made and establish'd thee?

7 Remember the dayes of old, consider the
years of many generations: ask thy father, and
he will shew thee, thy elders, and they will tell
thee.

7
Remember ye the dayes of old,
yeers past consider well;
Thy father ask, he will thee shew,
thy Elders will thee tell.


8 When the most high divided to the nations
their inheritance, when he separated the sons of
Adam,

8
When the most High to Nations did
th' inheritance divide,
When he the sons of Adam all
did separate beside,

He set the bounds of the people according to
the number of the children of Israel.

He by his wisedome set the bounds
then of the people all,
According to the number of
the children of Isra'l.

9 For the Lords portion is his people: Iacob
is the lot of his inheritance.

9
For to his portion hath the Lord
his people without blot:
And of his own inheritance
his Jacob is the lot.

10 He found him in a desert land, and in the
waste howling wildernesse: he led him about,
he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of
his eye.

10
In wildernesse he found , in
wast howling desert dry:
He led, instructed, and  kept
as th'ple of his eye.


11 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth
over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, ta|keth
them, beareth them on her wings.

11
As th' Eagle stirreth up her nest,
fluttreth her young upon,
Her wings doth spread, and taketh them,
and beareth them thereon.

12 So the Lord alone did lead him, and
there was no strange god with him.

12
So by his might the Lord alone
did lead him carefully,
And no strange god there was at all
with him in company.

13 He made him ride on the high places of
the earth, that he might eat the increase of the
fields, and he made him to suck hony out of
the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.

13
On earths high place he made him ride,
fields increase for to eat,
From flinty rocks he made him suck
the oyl and honey sweet.

14 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with
fat of lambs and rams of the breed of Bashan,

14
Of Kine the butter, and of sheep
the milk, for them in need,
With fat of lambs, and also rams,
that were of Bashans breed.


And goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat,
and thou didst drink the pure bloud of the grape.

He gave them goats, with Kidneys fat
of wheat that was right good,
And thou also ev'n of the grape
didst drink the purest blood.



The second Part.
15 But Iesurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou
art waxen fat, thou art grown thick,

15
But Jesurun then waxed fat,
and he did also kick:
Thou waxed art exceeding fat,
thou art grown very thick,

Thou art covered with fatnesse; then he for|sook
God which made him, and lightly esteemed
the rock of his salvation.

With fatnesse thou art cov'rd, he then
God which him made forsook,
And he of his salvations rock
light estimation took.

16 They provocked him to jealousie with
strange gods, with abominations provoked they
him to anger.

16
They him provok'd to jealousie
with strange gods evry way,
Him with abominations
to wrath provoked they.


17 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God;
to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that
came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.

17
To dev'ls not God they sacrific'd,
to gods whom they not knew,
New gods whom not your fathers fear'd,
that were come up of new.

18 Of the rock that begat thee thou art un|mindfull,
and hast forgotten God that formed
thee.

18
Thou art unmindfull of the rock
which once thee did beget,
And God himself that formed thee
thou likewise didst forget.



The third Part.
19 And when the Lord saw it, he abhorred
them, because of the provocking of his sons, and
of his daughters.

19
And when the Lord it saw, he did
abhor them evry one,
Because of the provoking great
of daughter and of son.

20 And he said, I will hide my face from
them, I will see what their end shall be: for they
are a very froward generation, children in whom
is no faith.

20
He said, I'le hide from them my face,
and I their end will see:

For they a very froward race,
and faithlesse children be.

21 They have moved me to jealousie with
that which is not God, they have provoked me to
anger with their vanities:

21
With that which is not God they have
me mov'd to jealousie,
To anger they have me provok'd,
ev'n with their vanitie.

And I will move them to jealousie with those
which are not a people, I will provoke them to
anger with a foolish nation.

And I'le them move to jealousie
with such as are no flock,
Them with a foolish nation
to anger I'le provoke.

22 For a fire is kindled in my anger, and
shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume
the earth with her increase, and set on fire the
foundations of the mountains.

22
For fire is kindled in my wrath,
it burns to lowest hell,
Earths increase, hills foundations
consum and fire it shall.

23 I will heap mischiefs upon them, I will
spend mine arrows upon them.

23
Upon them likewise great mischiefes
most surely heap I will,

And in mine anger I will spend
on them mine arrows ill.

24 They shall be burnt with hunger, and
devoured with burning heat, and with bitter de|struction:

24
They shall be altogether burnt
with pain of hunger great,
And with destruction bitter als
devour'd with burning heat:

I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them,
with the poyson of serpents of the dust.

I also will the teeth of beasts
upon them fiercely thrust,
Ev'n with the poison that is of
the serpents of the dust.

25 The sword without, and terrour within,
shall destroy both the young man and the virgin,
the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.

25
The sword without, terrour within,
the young man shall destroy,
The virgin, and the suckling als
with him whose haires are gray.

26 I said, I would satter them into corners,
I would make the remembrance of them to cease
from among men:

26
I said, that into corners I
would them all scatter then,

I would make their remembrance als
to cease from among men:

27 Were it not that I feared the wrath of
the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave
themselves strangly,

27
Yea were it not I fear'd the wrath
of th' enemy they have,
And lest that their adversaries
should strangely them behave,

And lest they should say, Our hand is high,
and the Lord hath not done all this.

And lest that they with hauty heart
should say these words anone:
Our hand now high is, and the Lord
this work all hath not done.

28 For they are a nation void of counsell,
neither is there any understanding in them.
29 O that they were wise, that they under|stood
this, that they would consider their latter
end.

28
For of counsell a Nation void
they are, nothing know they,


29
O that they wise this understood,
and their last end would weigh.

30 How should one chase a thousand, and
two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock
had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?


30
How should but one a thousand chase,
and two chase thousands ten:
xcept their Rock thus had them sold,
and them shut up had then.

31 For their rock is not as our Rock, even
ur enemies themselves being judges.

31
For in no way the rock that's theirs
as our Rock mighty is,
Our enemies themselves they are
the judges ev'n of this.

32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodomnd
of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are
apes of gall, their clusters are bitter.

2
Of Sodoms vine and Gomors fields,
their vine is surely all,
Their clusters they most bitter are,
their grapes are grapes of gall.

33 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and
he cruell venime of aspes.
34 Is not this laid up in store with me, and
aled up among my treasures?

3
Their wine of dragons poison is,
of asps the venim strong:


4
4 Is not this laid in store with me
my treasures seal'd among?



The fourth Part.
35 To me belongeth vengeance, and re+mpence,
their foot shall slide in due time:


35
Vengeance to me and recompence
belongeth for their crime:
Their foot shall slide assuredly
in due appointed time.

For the day of their calamity is at hand, and
the things that shall come upon them make haste.

The day of their calamity
it is now near at hand,
And things that shall upon them come
make hast, and shall not stand.

36 For the Lord shall judge his people, and
repent himself for his servants; when he seeth
that their power is gone, and there is none shut
up, or left.

36
For God shall his own people judge,
and for his saints repent,
When none shut up or left he sees
but that their power is spent.

37 And he shall say, where are their gods,
their rock in whom they trusted.

37
And he in his great wrath shall say,
where are their gods now gone?
Their stable rock in whom they all
did put their trust alone.

38 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices,
and drank the wine of their drink-offerings? let
them rise up and help you, and be your pro|tection.


38
Which fat ate of their sacrifice,
and drank drink offrings wine:
Let them rise up now and you help,
as your protection fine.

39 See now that I, even I am he, and
there is no god with me: I kill, and I make
alive; I wound, and I heal:

39
See now that I am he, ev'n I,
no god there is with me:
I kill, and make alive; I wound,
and als make whole to be.

Neither is there any that can deliver out of
my hand.
40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say,
I live for ever.

Nor is there any now that can
out of my hand deliver:


40
For I lift up my hand to heaven,
and say, I live for ever.

41 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine
hand take hold on judgement; I will render
vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward
them that hate me.

41
If hold my hand on judgement take,
and glittring sword I whet,
I'le render vengeance to my foes,
and pay those that me hate.


42 I will make mine arrows drunk wit
blood (and my sword shall devour flesh)

42
I also those mine arrows will
make drunk with blood therefore,
The flesh of all mine enemies
my sword it shall devore.

And that with the blood of the slain, and o
the captives, from the beginning of revenges upo
the enemy.

With blood of those that have been slain
and those that captives ly
From the beginning of revenge
upon the enemy.

43 Rejoice, O ye nations with his people
for he will avenge the bloud of his servants,

43
Rejoice ye nations with his folk,
for he who doth not change,
Will of his servants all the blood
in his own time avenge.

And will render vengeance to his adversaries,
and will be mercifull unto his land, and to his
people.

And will to his adversaries
a vengeance render full,
And to his people and his land
he will be mercifull.

against the army of Iabin King of Ca|naan;

JUDGES 5. vers. 2.
PRaise ye the LORD for the avenging of
Israel, when the people willingly offered
themselves:

FOr the avenging of Isral
praise ye the Lord most hy,
When as the people offered
themselves most willingly.

3 Hear, O ye kings, give ear, O ye princes;
I, even I will ing unto the Lord, I will sing
praise to the Lord God of Israel.

3
Hear Oye Kings, ye Princes als
give ear, I, ev'n I will
Sing to the Lord, to Israels God
I will sing praises still.

4 Lord when thou wentedst out of Seir,
when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom,
the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the
clouds also dropped water.

4
Lord when thou wentest out of Seir,
and march'd from Edom field,

The earth did tremble, heav'ns did drop,
the clouds did water yeeld.

5 The mountaines melted from before the
Lord, even that Sinai from before the Lord
God of Israel.

5
The mountains melted from before
the Lord God Eternall,
Ev'n that Sinai from God before,
the God of Israel.

6 In the dayes of Shamgar the son of Anath,
in the dayes of Iael, the high-wayes were un|occupied,
and the travellers walked through by|wayes.

6
In dayes of Shamgar Anaths son
of Jael in the dayes,
The high wayes were unoccupi'd
men travell'd through bywayes.

7 The inhabitants of the villages ceased,
they ceased in Israel, untill that IDeborah arose
that I arose a mother in Israel.

7
They ceas'd that dwelt in villages,

God when she had born Samuel, af|ter
long barrenesse.
1 SAM. 2. vers. 1.
MY heart rejoiceth in the Lord, mine horn
is exalted in the Lord, my mouth is en|larged
over mine enemies: because I rejoice in
thy salvotion.

MY heart in God doth joy, in God
my horn's rais'd: ov're my foes
My mouth inlarged is, for I
do in thy health rejoice.

is none beside thee: neither is there any rock
like our God.

2
There is none holy as the Lord,
for none is thee beside:
Nor is there any rock that doth
like to our God abide.

3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly, let not
arrogancie come out of your mouth:

3
See that henceforth ye do no more
exceeding proudly talk,
Nor let your tongue within your mouth
with arrogancy wall.

For the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by
him actions are weighed.

Because the Lord he is a God
of knowledge as we see,
And by him in a ballance just
all actions weighed be.

4 The bows of the mighty men are broken,
and they that stumbled, are girt with strength.

4
The bows ev'n of the mighty men
are broken all at length,
And they that stumbled here and there
are well now girt with strength.

5 They that were full, have hired out them|selves
for bread, and they that were hungry,
eased:


5
They that very full now have
hir'd out themselves for bread,
And they that also hungry were,
did cease from having need:

So that the barren hath born seven, and she
that hath many children, is waxed feeble.

So that she that still barren was,
hath born sev'n great and small,
And she that many children hath
is waxed feeble all.

6 The Lord killeth, and maketh alive, 
bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.

6
The Lord almighty doth both kill
and als alive doth save,
He bringeth up, and likewise he
brings down unto the grave.

7 The Lord maketh poor, and maketh ri
he bringeth low, and lifteth up.

7
The Lord is he that maketh poore
and also maketh rich,
He bringeth very low, and he
up lifteth to a pitch.

8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, an
lifteth up the begger from the dunghill, to se
them among princes,

8
He raiseth from the dust the poore,
the begger from dunghill

He lifteth up, them for to set
among the Princes still.

And to make them inherit the throne of glory:

hath set the world upon them.

Of glorys Throne to make them heires,

Of earth the pillars are, and he

 dark shall silent be, for none
prevaile shall by his strength.

to pieces: out of heaven shall he thunder
no them:

10
The Lords adversaries they shall
in pieces broken be,
ut of the heaven upon them
a thundring make shall he.

The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth,
d he shall give strength unto his king, and ex|
he horn of his anointed.


Ends of the earth the Lord shall judge,
and strength give to his King,
The horn of his Anointed One
he shall exalt to reign.



The lamentations of David for the death
of Saul and Ionathan, slaine upon
the mountain of Gilboah.
2 SAM. 1. vers. 19.
THe beauty of Israel is slain upon thy hi
places: how are the mighty fallen.

OF Israel is the beauty slain
upon thy places hy,
How is it that thy mighty men
are fallen shamefully!

2 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in 
streets of Askelon: lest the daughters of 
Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the 
circumcised triumph.

2
Tell't not in Gath nor Askelon,
lest Philistines rejoice,
Lest daughters of th' uncircumcisde
triumph with shouting voice.

3 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be 
dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fiel
of offerings:

3
Ye of Gilboah mountains high
O let there be no dew,

Let neither fields of offerings,
nor rain be upon you,

For there the shield of the mighty is vilely
cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had
not been anointed with oil.

For of the mighty is the shield,
there cast away as vile,
The shield of Saul as he had not,
anointed been with oil.

4 From the bloud of the slain, from the fat
of the mighty, the bow of Ionathan turned not
back, and the sword of Saul returned not
empty.

4
From bloud of slain, from mighties fate
the bow of Jonathan
Did not turn back, the sword of Saul
return'd not empty than.

5 Saul and Ionathan were lovely and plea|sant
in their lives, and in their death they were
not divided.

5
Saul, Jonathan, both lovely were
and pleasant in their lives,
And in their death at last they not
divided were likewise.

They were swifter then eagles, they were
stronger then lions.

Then Eagles that are swift in flight
they were both swifter far,

Yea they both stronger were also
then fiercest lions are.

6 Ye daughters of Israel weep over Saul,
who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights,
who put on ornaments of gold upon your ap|parell.

6
Ye Israels daughters, weep ov'r Saul
who with delights eachone
In scarlet cloth'd, who ornaments
of gold your clothes put on.

7 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of
the battell! O Ionathan, thou wast slaine in
thine bigh places.

7
How in midst of the battell do
the mighty fallen ly!
O Jonathan thou wast ev'n slain
upon thy places hy.

8 I am distressed for thee, my brother Io|nathan:
very pleasant hast thou been unto me:

8
My brother Jonathan, I am
distressed ore for thee,
For very pleasant thou hast been
at all times unto me:

Thy love to me was wonderfull, passing the
love of women.
9 How are the mighty fallen, and the wea|pons
of war perished.


Thy love to me was wonderfull,
all womens love it past:


9
How fell the mighty, and of warre
were all the weapons lost!



The Song of David, which he sang to give
thanks after that Nathan had promised
him benefits and blessings, but chiefly the
Messias to come of his seed.
2 SAM. 7. vers. 18.
WHo am I, O Lord God? and what is
my house, that thou hast brought mee
hitherto?

O Lord my God, now who am I
that thou on me hast thought?
What is my house that thou in love
me hitherto hast brought?

2 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight,
O Lord God; but thou hast spoken also of thy
servants house for a great while to come,

2
And this O Lord God in thy sight,
a small thing was in summe;
But of thy servants house thou spak'st
for a great while to come.

And is this the manner of man, O Lord
God?
3 And what can David say more unto thee?
for thou, Lord God, knowest thy servant.


Lord God, is this the maner of man?


3
What David more thee to
Can say? for thou O Lord my God
dost me thy servant kno.

4 For thy words sake, and according to
thine own heart hast thou done all these great
things; to make thy servant know them.

4
For thy words sake, according to
thine own heart hast thou done
All those great things, for them to make
unto thy servant known.

5 Wherefore thou art great, O Lord God:
for there is none like thee, neither is there
any god beside thee, according to all that we have
heard with our ears.

5
Thou Lord art great, like thee is none,
no God is thee beside,
According to all things that wee
with our own ears have tri'd.

6 And what one nation in the earth is like
thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to
redeem for a people to himself,

6
And what one Nation in the earth
doth like thy people seem,
Like Israel whom to himself,
God went for to redeem,

And to make him a name, and to do for you
great things, and terrible for thy land,


Ev'n for a people, and a Name
to make him, and to do
For you great things and terrible,
for this thy land also,

Before thy people which thou redeemdst
to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their
gods?

Before thy people which thou hast
redeemed unto thee
From Egypt, from the Nations,
and these their gods that be.

7 For thou hast confirmed to thy self thy
people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever
and thou, Lord, art become their God.

7
For to thy self thou Isra'l hast
confirm'd to thee for ay
A people; and thou art, O Lord,
become their God alway.

8 And now, O Lord God, the word that
thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and
concerning his house, establish it for ever, and
do as thou hast said.

8
What of thy servant and his house
thou Lord hast spoken now,
Do as thou saidst, and so for ay
establish it do thou.

9 And let thy name be magnified for ever,

saying; The Lord of hosts is the God over
Israel:

9
And let thy Name that's glorious
be magnifi'd for ay,
The Lord of hosts he is the God
that's over Israel, say;

And let the house of thy servant David hee
established before thee.
10 For thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Is|rael,
hast revealed to thy servant,

Let Davids house thy servant be
before thee stablish'd well:


10
Thou Lord of hosts, Israls God didst
to thy servant reveal:

Saying, I will build thee an house: therefore
hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this
prayer unto thee.

Thou said'st I will thee build an house,
therefore thy servant hee
Hath in his heart found for to pray
this prayer unto thee.

11 And now, O Lord God, thou art that
God, and thy words he true, and thou hast
promised this goodnesse unto thy servant.

11
And now, O Lord, that God thou art,
thy words are very true,
And thou this goodnesse promisde hast
unto thy servant now.


12 Therefore now let it please thee to blesse
the house of thy servant, that it may continue
for ever before thee:

12
Therefore be pleased for to blesse
thy servants house alway,
That it may so continue still
before thee fast for ay.

For thou O Lord God, hast spoken it, and
with thy blessing let the house of thy servant
be blessed for ever.

For thou Lord God hast spoken it,
with blessings come from thee
O do thou let thy servants house
for ever blessed be.



The Song of Isaiah, concerning the vineyard,
wherein Gods people is reproved for their
barrennesse in good works, notwithstanding
of all the paines were taken by the Prophets.
ISAIAH 5. vers. 1.
NOw will I sing to my welbeloved, a song,
of my beloved touching his vineyard: my
welbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruit|full
hill.

TO my Beloved of his vine
a song now sing I will:
My Welbelov'd a vineyard hath
in a most fruitfull hill.


2 And he fenced it, and gathered out the
stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest
vine, and bult a tower in the midst of it.

2
He did it fence, and gathered out
the stones thereof eachone,
He planted it with choicest vine,
a tower he built thereon.

And also made a wine-presse therein: and he
looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it
brought forth wilde grapes.

Hee a vine-presse made als therein,
and look'd it should bring forth
Good grapes, but forth at last it brought
wild grapes of nothing worth.

3 And now; O inhabitants of Ierusalem,
and men of Iudah, judge, I pray you, betwix
me and my vineyard.

3
And now, O ye inhabitants
of Salem, and als ye
Of Judah men, judge, I you pray,
'twixt my vineyard and me.

4 What could have been done more to my
vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore
when I looked that it should bring forth grapes,
brought it forth wilde grapes?

4
What could I my vineyard unto
do more then I have done?

Wherefore when for good grapes I look'd,
did wild grapes grow thereon?

5 And now go to; I will tell you what I
will do to my vineyard, I will take away the
hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up:

5
And now go to; I'le tell you what
I'le to my vineyard do,
I'le take away its hedge, and it
shall be up eaten so:

And break down the wall thereof, and it
shall be troden down.
6 And I will lay it waste: it shall not bee
pruned, nor digged,

And I'le break down the wall thereof,
and it trode down shall be:


6
I'le lay it wast, none pruned shall
nor yet it digged see,

But there shall come up briers and thorns: I
will also command the clouds that they rain no
rain upon it.

But briars and thornes there shall come up:
I also will anone
Command the clouds that they no rain
shall rain the same upon.

7 For the vineyard of the Lord of hoasts
is the house of Israel, and the men of Iudah
his pleasant plant.


7
For vineyard of the Lord of hosts
the house of Israel is,
The men of Judah also are
the plasant plant of his.

And he looked for judgement, but behold op|pression;
for righteousnesse, but behold a cry.

And he did then for judgement look,
but lo oppression hard;
For rigtheousnesse, but O behold,
a cry then there was heard.

, even to the ground, he bringeth it even to

For dwellers high he doth bring down,
the city proud layes low,
He layes it low, to ground it brings

6 The foot shall tread it down, even the feet
 the poore, and the steps of the needy.
7 The way of the just is uprightnesse: thou
ost upright, dost weight the path of the just.

The foot, poores feet and needies steps

Yea with my spirit within me I
will seek thee early right:

For when thy judgments are in the earth
the inhabitants of the world will learn righte|ousnesse.

For when the judgements that thou sends
upon the earth do presse,
Then all the worlds inhabitants
will learn thy righteousnesse.

10 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, y
will he not learn righteousnesse:

10
Let unto him that wicked is
be favour shew'd not small,
Yet for the same he righteousnesse
will not then learn at all:

In the land of uprightnesse will he deal un|justly,
and will not behold the majesty of 
LORD.

Ev'n in the land of uprightnesse
he will unjustly deal,
And of the Lord the Majesty
behold no way he will.

or yet the worlds inhabitants
at all down fallen have.

19 Thy dead men shall live, together with
dead body shall they arise:

Thy men that dead are they shall live
together well they all
ith my dead bodie ev'n revive,
and als arise they shall:

Awake and sing ye that dwell in dust: for thy
 is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall
 out the dead.

ake, sing ye in dust that dwell,
as dew of herbes indeed
is thy dew, and als the earth
shall cast out all her dead.

Come, my people, enter thou into thy cham|s,
and shut thy doores about thee: hide thy
 as it were for a little moment, untill the
ignation be overpast.

My people, to thy chambers come
doors shut about thee fast,
 thou thee for a moment hide,
till wrath be overpast.


21 For behold, the Lord cometh out of his
place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for
their iniquitie:

21
For lo, the Lord out of his place
doth come most speedilie
To punish earths inhabitants,
for their iniquitie.

The earth also shall disclose her bloud, and
shall no more cover her slain.

The earth shall als disclose the blood,
that in it did remain,
And shall no more the means afford,
to cover close her slain.



The Song of Hezekiah, after God had
healed him of his sicknesse. c.
ISA. 38. vers. 10.
I Said in the cutting off of my dayes, I shall g
to the gates of the grave: I am deprived o
the residue of my years.

IN cutting off my dayes I said,
to gates of grave I'le go:
Of those my yeers the residue
I am deprived so.

2 I said, I shall not see the Lord, even th
Lord in the land of the living: I shall behold
man no more with the inhabitants of the world,

2
In livings land the Lord, the Lord,
I said, I shall not see:

I shall no more see man with those
on earth that dwellers be.

3 Mine age is departed, and is removed
from me, as a shepheards tent: I have cut off like
a weaver my life:

3
Departed is mine age, and is
remov'd from me with strife
As shepherds tents; I weaver like
have thus cut off my life.

He will cut me of with pining sicknesse: from
day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

That I may wholly be cut off,
hee'le pining sicknesse send,
From day ev'n unto night wilt thou
so of me make an end.

4 I reckoned till monrning, that as a lion so
will he break all my bones: from day even to
ight wilt thou make an end of me.

4
I reck'ned untill morn, that as
a lion so will he
Break all my bones; from day to night
thou'lt make an end of me.

5 Like a cran or a swallow, so did I chatter:
I did mourn as a dove,

5
Ev'n like a cran in my distresse,
or as a swallow sad
So did I chatter: as a dove
a heavy mourning had.


Mine eyes fail with looking upward: O
Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me.

Mine eyes they long with looking up
now very failed be,
O Lord, I am oppressed sore,
do undertake for me.

6 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto
me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all
my years in the bitternesse of my soul.

6
What shall I say? He spoken hath,
and als hath done no lesse,
I shall go softly all my years
in my souls bitternesse.

7 O Lord, by these things men live, and in
all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt
thou recover me, and make me to live.

7
Lord by those things men live, in them
my spirit life doth take,
And so thou wilt recover me,
and me to live wilt make.

8 Behold, for peace I had great bitternesse;
but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it
from the pit of corruption:

8
O do behold, how for my peace
I had great bitternesse,
But thou in love hast sav'd my soul
from pit of rottennesse.

For thou hast cast all my sins behinde thy


9 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can
not celebrate thee: they that go down into the
it cannot hope for thy truth.
My sins thou cast behind thy back:

9
For neither grave nor death
Can praise thee, they that go to pit
cannot hope for thy truth.

10 The living, the living, he shall praise
hee, as I do this day: the father to the children
shall make known thy truth.

10
The living, yea the living shall
thee praise, as I this day:
The father to the children shall
make known thy truth alway.

11 The Lord was readie to save me: there|fore
we will sing my songs to the stringed instru|ments,
all the dayes of our life, in the house
of the LORD.

11
The Lord was ready me to save,
wee'l while we live accord
My songs to stringed instruments
in the house of the Lord.




THE LAMENTATIONS
OF IEREMIAH.

CHAPTER. 1.
HOw doth the city sit solitary, that was full
of people? how is she become as a wi|dow?

HOw is it that the City doth
sit solitary still?
How is she as a Widow now,
that people much did fill?

She that was great among the nations, and
princesse among the provinces, how is she become
tributarie.

She that among the Nations
was great, and Princesse made
Among Provinces, how is she
thus tributary treade?

2 She weepeth sore in the night, and her
tears are on her cheecks: among all her lovers
she hath none to comfort her,

2
She weepeth very sore by night,
and on her cheeks are tears;
Mong all her Lovers she hath none
for comfort in her fears.

All her friends have dealt treacherously with
her, they are become her enemies.
3 Iudah is gone into captivity, because of af|fliction,


Her friends all have dealt treacherously
with her, and turn'd her foes;
Judah's gone to captivity,
because of many woes;

And because of great servitude: she dwel|h
among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all
r persecutors overtook her between the straits.

nd for the servitude that's great:
'mong heathen she doth dwell,
e findes no rest, her took in straits
her persecutors fell.

4 The wayes of Zion do mourn, because none
me to the solemne feasts: all her gates are
solate:

The wayes of Zion they do mourn,
because there is none that
ome to the solemn feasts, yea all
her gates are desolate.

Her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted,
 she is in bitternesse.

er Priests they in great trouble sigh,
her Virgins more and lesse
re grievously afflicted all,
and she's in bitternes.

5 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies
sper: for the Lord hath afflicted her.

These that are her adversaries,
the chief above her be;

Her enemies prosper, for the Lord
afflicted her hath he.

For the multitude of her transgressions, her
children are gone into captivity before the
enemie.

And also for the multitude
of her transgressions hye,
Her children before th' en'my are
gone in captivity.

6 And from the daughter of Zion all her
beauty is departed: her princes are become
like harts that finde no pasture,

6
From her that Zions daughter is,
the beauty all is gone,
Her Princes are become like Harts,
that pasture do finde none.

And they are gone without strength before
the pursuer.
7 Ierusalem remembred in the dayes of her
affliction.

Before the fierce pursuer they
without all strength are gone.


7
Salem remembred in the dayes
of her affliction,

And of her miseries, all her pleasant things
that she had in the dayes of old,

And in time of her miseries
things pleasant to behold,

That she had in possession
ev'n in the dayes of old,

When her people fell into the hand of the
enemie, and none did help her, the adversaries
saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.

When fell in hands of enemies
the people of her stock,
And none her helpt, the foes it saw,
and did her Sabbaths mock.

8 Ierusalem hath grievously sinned: there|fore
she is removed: all that honoured her, de|spise
her,

8
Jerusalem sinn'd greivously,
she is remov'd therfore:
They all together her despise,
that honourd her before:

Because they have seen her nakednesse: yea,
she sigheth and turneth backward.

Because that they her nakednes
have seen while she did mourn,
Yea, she doth sigh most heavily,
and backward als doth turn:

9 Her filthinesse is in her skirts, she remem|breth
not her last end, therefore she came downe
wonderfully:

9
Her filthines is in her skirts,
her last end she not on

At all remembreth, therefore she
came wonderfully down.

She had no comforter: O Lord, behold my
affliction: for the enemie hath magnified
himself.

No comforter she had; O Lord,
see my affliction,
For that the enemy himself
hath magnifi'd alone.

10 The adversary hath spread out his hand
upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen

10
The adversary hath spread out
his hand on what had been
All her things pleasant on the earth,
for she hath clearly seen

That the heathen entred into her Sanctuary,
whom thou didst command that they should not
enter into thy congregation.

That heathen men had thus into
her Sanctuary gone,
Whom thou wouldst not to enter in
thy Congregation.

11 All her people sigh, they seek bread, they
have given their pleasant things for meat to re|lieve
the soul:

11
Her people sigh, they all seek bread,
and also they did give

Their things that pleasant are for mear,
their soul for to relieve.

See, O Lord, and consider, for I am become
ile.
12 Is it nothing to you, all ye that passe by?
behold and see,
See Lord: consider, for I'm vile,

12
Is it nothing to you
All passers by? See and also
this well consider now,

If there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow,
which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord
hath afflicted me, in the day of his fierce anger.

If any sorrow be like mine
done to me, ev'ry way
Wherewith the Lord afflicted me
in his fierce angers day.

13 From above hath he sent fire into my
bones, and it prevaileth against them:

13
He from above into my bones
sent fire me to assail,
And it in a most fearfull way
against them doth prevail:

He hath spread a net for my feet, he hath
urned me back: he hath made me desolate, and
faint all the day.

He turnd me back, and for my feet
a net spread in the way;

He hath als made me desolate,
and faint ev'n all the day.

14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by
his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon
my nc:

14
The yoke of my transgressions is
bound by his hand alone,
They wreathed are, and also they
come up my neck upon:

He hath made my strength to fall, the Lord
hath delivered me into their hands, from whom
I am not able to rise up.

He hath my strength made for to fall,
the Lord hath me likewise
Delivered into their hands
from whom I cannot rise.

15 The Lord hath troden under foot
all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath
called an assembly against me,

15
God under foot in midst of me
hath trod my mighties all,
In midst of me; he against me
did an assemblie call

To crush my young men: the Lord hath
troden the virgin, the daughter of Iudah, as in 
wine-presse.

So for to crush my young men all;
the Lord hath with distresse

The virgin Judahs daughter trode,
ev'n as in a wine-presse.

16 For these things I weep, mine eye, mine
eye runneth down with water, because the com|forter
that should relieve my soul, is far from me:

16
For this I weep, with water down
mine eye doth run, mine eye,
For the comforter that my soul
should save, is farre from me:

My children are desolate, because the enemy
prevailed.
17 Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there
is none to comfort her:

Because the enemy prevail'd
my sonnes are spoil'd eachone


17
Zion she spreadeth forth her hands,
to comfort her there's none,

The Lord hath commanded concerning Iacob,
that his adversaries should be round about him:
Ierusalem is as a menstruous woman among
them.

Concerning Jacob God ordaind
his foes about him round;
Among them is Jerus'lem as
a menstruous woman found.

18 The Lord is righteous, for I have rebel|ed
against his commandment: hear I pray you,
ll people, and behold my sorrow:


18
The Lord is righteous, for I have
rebell'd against his will:
I pray you people all to hear.
and see my sorrow still:

My virgins and my young men are gone into
captivity.
19 I called for my lovers but they deceived
me;

My Virgins and my young Men are
gone in captivitie


19
I for my lovers then did call,
but they deceived me.

My priests and mine elders gave up the ghost
in the city, while they sought their meat to re|lieve
their souls.

My Priests, yea and mine Elders als
then up the ghost did give,
While meat they in the city sought
their souls for to relieve.

20 Behold, O Lord, for I am in distresse;
my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned
within me, for I have grievously rebelled:

20
See Lord, my bowels troubled are,
for in distresse am I:
Mine heart's turn'd in me, for I have
rebelled grievously,

Abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there
is as death.

21 They have heard that I sigh, there is
none to comfort me:

Abroad the sword bereaves, at home
there is as death we see:


21
They have all heard that I do sigh
there's none to comfort me:

All mine enemies have heard of my trouble,
they are glad that thou hast done it thou wilt
bring the day that thou hast called,

Mine en'mies all my trouble heard,
that thou the same hast done
They are right glade; thou'lt bring they day
that thou hast cald anone,

And they shall be like unto me.
22 Let all their wickednesse come before thee,
and do unto them,
And they shall be like unto me:

22
Do thou now let therefore
Ev'n all their grievous wickednes
come clearly thee before.

And do thou unto them as thou hast done
unto me for all my transgressions, for my sigh
are many and my heart is faint.

As thou to me for all my faults
hast done, do them unto,
For now my sighs they many are,
my heart is faint also.




CHAPTER II.
HOw hath the Lord covered the daughter of
Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast
down from heaven unto the earth the beautie of
Israel,

HOw Zions daughter hath the Lord
cov'rd with a cloud in wrath?
And unto earth from heav'n cast down
Israels beauty hath?

And remembred not his footstool in the day
of his anger?
2 The Lord swallowed up the habitations
of Iacob:

And in the day of's wrath did not
to minde his footstool call?


2
The Lord the habitations hath
of Jacob swallow'd all,

And hath not pitied: he hath thrown down
in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of
Iudah:

And he them hath not pitied:
he in his wrath so sad
Thrown down by force hath the strong holds
that Judahs daughter had:

He hath brought them down to the ground:
he hath polluted the kingdome and the princes
thereof.


He by his might unto the ground
hath made them all to fall:
The kingdom he polluted hath,
and Princes there of all,

3 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the
horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right
hand from before the enemie,

3
Of Isra'l all the horn cut off
in his fierce wrath hath he,
He hath drawn back his right hand from
before the enemie:

And e burned against Iacob like a flaming
fire which devoureth round about.
4 He hath bent his bow like an enemie:

'Gainst Jacob he like flaming fire
did burn which wasts about:


4
He hath his bow bent, like unto
an enemy most stou.

He stood with his right hand as an adversary
nd slew all that were pleasant to the eye, in the
bernacle of the daughter of Zion:

s an adversarie he stood,
what pleasant was to th' eye
ith his right hand within the tent
of Zion all slew he:

He poured out his furie like fire.
5 The Lord was as an enemie: he hath

swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all
her palaces:
His fury he powr'd out like fire,

5
God was as enemy:
He swallow'd Isra'l, he devour'd
he palaces so hy:

He hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath
increased in the daughter of Iudah mourning
and lamentation.

His strong holds he destroyed hath,
and hath increasde anone
In Judahs daughter mourning great,
and lamentation.

6 And he hath violently taken awayhis ta|bernacle,
as if it were of a garden, he hath de|stroyed
his places of the assembly:

5
He violently remov'd his tent,
as't of a garden were,
He of th' assembly hath destroyd
the places that are there:

The Lord hath caused the solemne feasts and
abbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath de|spised
in the indignation of his anger the king
and the priest.

God causd in Zion solmn feasts
and sabbaths be forgot,
In his wraths indignation he
King, Priest, regarded not.


7 The Lord hath cast off his alter: he hath
abhorred his sanctuarie: he hath given up in|to
the hand of the enemie the walls of her pa|laces;

7
The Lord his altar hath cast off,
and loth'd his Sanctuary:
Her palace wals he in the hand
gave of the enemy,

They have made a noise in the house of the
Lord, as in the day of a solemn feast.

Within the house that is the Lords
a noise als made have they,
As if it for a solemn feast
had been a joyfull day.

8 The Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall
of the daughter of Zion; he hath stretched out
a line: he hath not withdrawn his hand from
destroying:

8
The Lord hath purpos'd to destroy
his Zions daughters wall
He stretch'd a line, he not withdrew
his hand from wasting all.

Therefore he made the rampart and the wall
to lament, they languished together.
9 Her ges are sunk into the ground;

Therefore he made the rampart so
and wall for to lament;
They languished together then;


9
Her gates to ground they went:


He hath destroyed and broken her bars; her
king and her princes are among the Gentiles;
the law is no more,

He hath destroyd, and broke her bars,
her King and Princes thus,
Among the Gentiles scattered are,
the law no more's for us.

Her prophets also finde no vision from the
LORD.
10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit
upon the ground and keep silence:

Her Prophets also from the Lord
at all no vision found,


10
Of Zions daughter th'elders als
sit silent on the ground;

They have cast up dust upon their heads; they
have girded themselves with sackcloth;

In this their grief they have cast up
the dust their heads upon,
And they themselves have also girt
with sackcloth evry one;

The virgins of Ierusalem hang down their
heads to the ground.
11 Mine eyes do fail with tears; my bowels
are troubled;

And Salems virgins hang their heads
down to the ground right farre,



1
Mine eyes they now do fail with tears:
my bowels troubled are,

My liver is poured upon the earth, for the de|ruction
of the daughter of my people, because
e children and the sucklings swoon in the
ets of the city.

y liver is powr'd on the earth
for the destruction
f people mine, because in streets
young children sucklings swoon.

12 They say to their mothers, Where is corn
d wine? when they swooned as the wounded in
e streets of the city,

2
They to their mothers said, Where is
corn, wine for to be found?
hen as within the cities streets
as wounded men they swoon'd,

When their soul was poured out into their
thers bosome.

'n at the same time when their soul
the city all throughout
to their mothers bosome was
with sorrow powred out.

13 What thing shall I take to witnesse for
e? what thing shall I liken to thee? O
ghter of Ierusalem?


13
What thing for thee to witnesse now
shall taken be by me?
O Salems daughter what shall I
now liken unto thee?

What shall I equall to thee, that I may
fort the, O virgin daughter of Zion? fo
breach is great like the sea;

O Virgin Zions daughter dear
that I may comfort thee,
What shall I equall thee unto?
thy breach great's like the sea.

Who can heal thee?
14 Thy prophets have seen vain and f
hings for thee,
Who is he that well can thee heal?

14
Thy prophets they have seen
Such things for thee as meerly vain
and foolish als have been,

And they have not discovered thine iniq
urn away thy captivity; but have seen fo
false burdens, and causes of banishment.

Thy sin they not discovered,
thy thrall to turn away
But burdens false, of banishment
the causes seen have they.

15 All that passe by, clap their ha
thee; they hisse and wag their head at the der
of Ierusalem, saying, Is this the city,


15
All that passe by clap hands at thee
they hisse and wag their head
At Salems daughter, saying thus,
is this the town indeed,

That men call the perfection of beautie, the
oy of the whole earth?
16 All thine enemies have opened their
mouth against thee: they hisse and gnash
he teeth:

That men beauties perfection call
of the whole earth the joy,


16
'Gainst thee thy foes their mouth make wide,
hisse, gnash their teeth do they:

They say, We have swallowed her up: certain|ly
this is the day that we looked for: we have
found, we have seen it.

They say we have her swallow'd up
this surely is the day
We looked for; we have it found,
we have it seen alway.

17 The Lord hath done that which he had
devised: he hath fulfilled his word that he had
commanded in the dayes of old:

17
The Lord hath done what he devisd,
fulfill'd he hath by sword,
That in the dayes that were of old
he did command by word.


He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied
and he hath caused thine enemies to rejoice o
thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversari

He down did throw and piti'd not
he causd thine enemies
To joy ov'r thee, the horn he raisd
of thine adversaries.

18 Their heart cried unto the Lord, O w
of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down li
a river day and night:

18
Their heart did cry unto the Lord,
O Zions daughters wall,
Let tears down still both day and night
ev'n like a river fall.

Give thy self no rest, let not the appl 
thine eyes cease.
19 Arise, cry out in the night:

Give to thy self no rest, let not
cease th' apple of thine eye


19
Do thou arise, and in the night
cease thou not out to cry:

In the beginning of the watches powre 
thine heart like water before the face of the Lor

See that in the beginning of
the watches thou powre out
Thine heart before the face of God,
like water round about.


Lift up thy hands towards him, for the life of
y young children, that faint for hunger in the
p of every street.

hy hand to him lift for the life
of thy young children all:
hat in the top of every street
for hunger fainting fall.

20 Behold, O Lord, and consider to whom
ou hast done this: shall the women eat their
uit, and children of a span long?

0
Lo. Lord, consider to whom thou
hast done this us among:
 shall the women eat their fruit
and babes of a span long?

Shall the Priest and the Prophet be slain in
 sanctuary of the Lord.
21 The young and the old lie on the ground
 the streets:

hall Priest and Prophet thus be slain
in Gods own Sanctuary?


1
The young and old both on the ground
within the streets do ly:

My virgins and my young men are fallen by
 sword: thou hast slain them in the day of
y anger, thou hast killed and not pitied.

ly Virgins, young men fell by sword,
thou hast them slain at last,
v'n in the day of thy fierce wrath
thou kill'd, not piti'd hast.


22 Thou hast called as in a solemn day my
terrours round about, so that in the day of the
Lords anger none escaped

22
Thou hast as in a solemn day
my terrours round about
Call'd so, that in Gods day of wrath
none hath escaped out,

Nor remained: those that I have swadled
and brought up, hath mine enemy consumed.

Nor yet remained hath alive.
those that I swadled have,
And als brought up, mine enemy
consum'd hath in the grave.



CHAPTER III.
I Am the man that hath seen affliction by
the rod of his wrath.
2 He hath led me and brought me into dark|nesse,
but not into light.

I Am the man that greef hath seen
by rod of his own wrath.


2
Now into darknesse, not to light
me led, and brought he hath.

3 Surely against me is he turned, he turneth
his hand against me all the day.

3
Surely against me ev'ry where
he turned is alway:
He in his wrath doth turn his hand
against me all the day


4 My flesh and my skin hath he made old, he
 broken my bones.
5 He hath builded against me, and compas|
me with gall and travell.

My flesh and skin he hath made old,
and bones hath broken small:


He 'gainst me built, and compast me
with travel and with gall.

6 He hath set me in dark places, as they
 be dead of old.
7 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot
 out: he hath made my chain heavie.

He hath me in dark places set,
as who of old be dead:


He hedg'd me, out I can not get,
my chain he heavy made.

8 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out
y prayer.
9 He hath enclosed my wayes with hewe
one: he hath made my paths roked.

When also I do cry and shout,
my prayer out shuts he:


He with hew'n stone my wayes enclosd,
my paths made crook'd to be.

10 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait,
nd as a lion in secret places.

0
He was unto me as a Bear,
that lying is in wait,

And as a lion that is in
the places most secret.

11 He hath turned aside my wayes, and puled
me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.

11
He turned hath aside my wayes,
and also more then that
He hath me pull'd in pieces all,
he made me desolate.

12 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a
mark for the arrow.
13 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver
to enter into my reins.

12
He bent his bow, he as a mark
for th'arrow set me so.


13
He hath his quivers arrowes causd
to pierce my reins into.

14 I was a derision to all my people, and
their song all the day.
15 He hath filled me with bitternesse, he
hath made me drunken with wormwood.

14
I to my people scorn, and song
all day was made to be:


15
He hath me fil'd with bitternesse,
with wormwood drunk made he.

16 He hath also broken my teeth with gra|vell
stones, he hath covered me with ashes.

16
He also broken hath my teeth
with gravell stones in wrath,

And likewise in his rage he me
with ashes cov'red hath.

17 And thou hast removed my soul far off
from peace: I forga prosperitie.
18 And I said, My strength and my hope is
perished from the Lord.

17
I good forgat, my soul thou hast
from peace removed far:


18
I said that from the Lord my strength
and hope als perish'd are.

19 Remembring mine affliction and my mi|serie,
the wormwood and the gall.
20 My soul hath them still in remembrance,
and is humbled in me.

19
Remembring mine affliction,
gall, wormwood, miserie;


20
My soul doth still remember them,
and humbled is in me.

21 This I recall to my minde, therefore have
I hope.
22 It is of the Lords mercie that we are not
consumed,

21
This I do to my minde recall,
therefore I hope in thee,


22
It's of the mercies of the Lord
wee not consumed be,

Because his compassions fail not.
32 They are new every morning: great is th
faithfulnesse.


Because that his compassions
fail not in any case:


23
They evry-morning still are new,
great is thy faithfulnesse.

24 The Lord is my portion, saith my soul,
therefore will I hope in him.
25 The Lord is good unto them that wait
for him, to the soul that seeketh him.

24
The Lord's my portion, saith my soul,
I'le hope in him therefore:


25
God's good to them that wait for him
to soules that him adore.

26 It is good that a man should both hope
and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.

26
It's good that both a man should hope,
and also quietly
For the salvation of the Lord
wait on continually.

27 It is good for a man that he bear the
yoke in his youth.
28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, be|cause
he hath born it upon him.

27
It's good in's youth man bear the yoke,


28
He sitteth so alone,
And silence keepes, because that he
hath born it him upon.

29 He putteth his mouth in the dust: if so
 there may be hope.

30 He giveth his cheek to him that smiet
im, he is filled full with reproach.

9
His mouth he putteth in the dust,
if so there hope may be:


30
He to the smiter gives his cheek,
fill'd with reproach is he,

31 For the Lord will not cast off for ever.
32 But though he cause grief, yet will he
ave compassion according to the multitude of his
ercies.

31
For God for ay will not cast off:


32
Though greef he cause, yet good
He'le pitie have according to
his mercies multitude.

33 For he doth not afflict willingly; nor
grieve the children of men.
34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners
of the earth,

33
For willingly he not afflicts,
nor doth mens children grieve:


34
Under his feet all prisoners
to crush on earth that live.

35 To turn aside the right of a man before
the face of the most high.
36 To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord
pproeth not.

35
To turn aside mans right before
the face of the most Hye,



36
God to subvert man in his cause
approves not willingly.

37 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to
passe, when the Lord commandeth it not.

37
Who is he that saith, and it then
to passe comes in the land,
When as the Lord in any way
did not the same command?

38 Out of the mouth of the most high pro|ceedeth
not evil and good.
39 Wherefore doth a living man complain,

38
Out of the most Highs mouth doth not
both good and ill proceed,


39
Wherefore thus doth a living man
complain in any need?

A man for the punishment of his sins?
40 Let us search and try our wayes, and turn
again to the Lord.
A man for his sins punishment.

40
Let us to search attain
And try our wayes, and to the Lord
let us now turn again.

41 Let us lift our heart with our hands
unto God in the heavens.
42 We have transgressed and have rebelled,
thou hast not pardoned.


41
Let us lift up our heart and hands
to God in heav'n at last:


42
We have transgressed and rebel'd
and thou not pardon'd hast.

43 Thou hast covered with anger, and per|secuted
us: thou hast stain, thou hast not pitied.

43
Thou persecuted hast, and us
with anger cov'rd at last,
Thou hast us by our enemies slain.
and thou not pitied hast.

44 Thou hast covered thy self with a cloud
that our prayer should not passe through.
45 Thou hast made us as the off-scouring
and refuse in the midst of the people.

44
Thou with a cloud thee cov'rd, that through
our suit passe should not thus.


45
Th' off-scouring and refuse thou madst
in midst of people us.

46 All our enemies have opened their mouths
against us.
47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation
and destruction.

46
Against us opned have their mouths
our enemies eachone:


47
Destruction, desolation, fear,
and snares come us upon.

48 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of

water, for the destruction of the daughter of my
people.

48
With rivers ev'n of water great
still runneth down mine eye,
Ev'n for destruction that doth on
my peoples daughter ly.

49 Mine eye trickleth down and ceaseth not,
without any intermission:
50 ill the Lord look down, and behold from
heaven.

49
Mine eye down trickleth, without cease
or intermission:


50
Till that the Lord from Heav'n behold,
and us look down upon.

51 Mine eye affecteth mine heart, because of
all the daughters of my citie.
52 Mine enemies chased me sore like a bird,
without cause.

51
Mine eye affects my heart, ev'n for
my cities daughters all:


52
Me without cause sore chas'd my foes
like to a bird that's small.

53 They have cut of my life in the dungeon,
and cast a stone upon me.
54 Waters flowed over mine head, then I
said, I am cut off.

53
In dungeon they cut off my life,
and cast on me a stone;



54
The waters ov'r my head did flow,
I said, cut off I'm gone.

55 I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of
he low dungeon.
56 Thou hast heard my voice, hide not thine
ear at my breathing, at my cry.

55
Out of the dungeon low, O Lord,
on thy Name called I,


56
Thou heardst my voice, hide not thine ear
while I do breath and cry.

57 Thou drewest near in the day that I cal|led
upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.
58 O Lord, thou hast pleadd the causes of
my soul, thou hast redeemed my life.

57
Thou near drewst when I call'd on thee,
thou saidst, Let fear be past,


58
Thou pleadst the causes of my soul,
my life redeem'd thou hast.

59 O Lord, thou hast seen my wrong, judge
thou my cause.
60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance, and
all their imaginations against me.

59
O Lord, do thou now judge my cause
my wrong all seene thou hast,


60
Thou their imaginations sawst
and vengeance 'gainst me hast.

61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord,
and all their imaginations against me.


61
Thou hast most clearly heard, O Lord,
how their reproach did fall,
And their imaginations
that were against me all.

62 The lips of those that rose up against me
and their device against me all the day.

62
The lips of those that up did rise
against me evry way,
And their device mischievous all
against me all the day.

63 Behold their sitting down and their rising
up, I am their musick.

63
Behold their sitting down, and als
their rising up for ill:
I in this case most surely am
become their musick still.

64 Render unto them a recompense, O
Lord, according to the work of their hands.

64
Unto them in thy sury great
O thou, the mighty Lord,
According to their handy work
a recompence afford,

65 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse un|to
them.
66 Persecute and destroy them in anger,
from under the heavens of the Lord.

65
Unto them sorrow give of heart,
thy curse unto them render,



66
From under the Lords heav'ns destroy,
them persecute in anger.



CHAPTER IV.
HOw is the gold become dim! how is the
most fine gold changed! the stones of the
sanctuary are poured out in the top of every
street.

HOw is the gold thus dim become?
how's fine gold changed frre?
The temples stones out in the top
of each street powred are.

2 The precious sons of Zion, compareable
to fine gold, how are they esteemed to earthen
piohers, the work of the hands of the potter!

2
The precious sons of Sion like
to fine gold in the lands,
How are they as earths pitchers thought
the work of potters hands?

3 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast,
hey give suck to their young ones: the daughter
f my people is become cruell, like the ostriches
n the wildernesse.


 Sea monsters ev'n draw out the breasts
their young ones suck to give,
My people's fierce like ostritches
in wildernesse that live.

4 The tongue of the sucking childe cleaveth
o the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young

children ask bread, and no man breaketh it un|to
them.

4
The sucking childe his tongue for thirst
to his mouths roof cleaves so,
The children young ask bread, and none
it breaketh them unto.

5 They that did feed delicately, are desolate
in the streets: they that were brought up in scar|let,
embrace dunghils.

5
They that did delicatly feed
in streets are desolate?
They that in scarlet were brought up
dunghills embrace for that:

6 For the punishment of the iniquity of the
daughter of my people, is greater then the pu|nishment
of the sin of Sodom,

6
Of sins my peoples daughter did
the punishment is more
Then of the sin of Sodome was
the punishment before.

That was overthrown as in a moment, and
no hands stayed on her.
7 Her Nazarites were purer then snow, they
were whiter then milk,

That in a moment was ov'rthrown,
no hands did stay on her;


7
Her Nazarites more pure then snow,
then milk they whiter were.


They were more rudy in body then rubies, their
olishing was of saphire.
8 Their visage is blacker then a coal: they
are not known in the streets:

Then rubies they more rudy were,
as polish'd saphire drawn:


8
Their visage blacker's then a coal,
in streets they are not known,

Their skin cleaveth to their bones: it is wi|thered,
it is become like a stick.
9 They that be slain with the sword, are bet|ter
then they that be slain with hunger:

Their skin it cleaveth to their bones,
it like a stick doth wither:


9
The slain with sword are better then
they that be slain with hunger.

For these pine away, stricken through for
want of the fruits of the field.

For piece and piece those pine away,
before to death they yeeld,
They stricken through are for the want
of fruits that fill the field.

10 The hands of the pitifull women have sod|den
their own children, they were their meat in
the destruction of the daughter of my people.

10
The hands of women pitifull
their children sodden have,
My folk in their destruction
for meat them did receive.


11 The Lord hath accomplished his fury, he
hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath
kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the
foundations thereof.

11
His fury God accomplish'd hath,
his wrath he out did powre;
In Zion he put fire which there
its ground-works did devoure.

12 The kings of the earth, and all the inha|bitants
of the world would not have beleeved,
that the adversary and the enemie should have
entred into the gates of Ierusalem.

12
Kings of the earth and dwellers in
the world would not believe,
That th' en'mie into Salems gates
to enter should get leave.

13 For the sins of her prophets, and the
iniquities of her priests, that have shed the bloud
of the just in the midst of her;

13
For sins of all her prophets vile
and priests iniquities,
That of the just have shed the blood
in midst of her that lyes.

14 They have wandred as blinde men in the
streets, they have polluted thmselves with bloud,
so that men could not touch their garments.


14
As blind they wandred in the streets,
themselves polluted much
They have with blood, ev'n so that men
could not their garments touch.

15 They cryed unto them, Depart ye, it is
unclean, depart, depart, touch not, when they
fled away and wandred:

15
They cried unto them, Depart,
unclean it is, we say,
Depart, depart, touch not, when thus
they wandring fled away:

They said among the heathen, they shall no
more sojourn there.
16 The anger of the Lord hath divided
them,

They said among the heathen, there
no more sojourn they shall.


16
The anger of the mighty Lord
divided hath them all.

He will no more regard them: they respected
not the persons of the priests, they favoured not
the elders.

Hee'l have no more regard to them:
of priests the persons they
Respected not, they favoured not
the elders any way.

17 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our

vain help: in our watching we have watched
for a nation that could not save us.

17
For us, our eyes for our vain help
as yet thy filed have,
We in our watching watched for
a Nation could not save.

18 They hunt our steps that we cannot go i
our streets: our end is near, our dayes are ful|filled,
for our end is come.

18
They hunt our steps, that we can not
go in our streets ov'rcome,
Our end is near, our dayes fulfill'd
are, for our end is come.

19 Our persecutors are swifter then the eagles
of the heaven they pursued us upon the moun|tains,
they laid wait for us in the wildernes.

19
Our persecutors swifter are
then heavens Eagles, thus
On hils they us pursu'd, and wait
in desert laid for us.

20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointe
of the Lord was taken in their pits, of whom
we said,

20
Likewise of our nostrils the breath
th' Anointed of the Lord,
Was apprehended in their pits
of whom we said this word,


Vnder his shadow we shall live among the
heathen.
21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of E|dom,
that dwellest in the land of Vz.

Under his addow we shall live
among the heathen thus,


21
Rejoice, O Eoms daughter that
dwell'st in the land of Uz.

The cup also shall passe through unto thee:
thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thy self
naked.

The cup also shall passe ev'n through
till it come unto thee:
Thou shalt thy self all naked make,
and thou shalt drunken be.

22 The punishment of thine iniquitie is ac|complished,
O daughter of Zion, he will no
more cary thee away into captivity.

22
The punishment accomplish'd is
of thine iniquitie,
O Zions daughter he'le no more
as captive cary thee.

He will visit thine iniquitie, O daughter of
Edom, he will discover thy sins.

O thou that Edoms daughter art
he surely visit still
Wilt thine iniquity, and he
thy sins discover will.




CHAPTER V.
REmember, O Lord, what is come upon us:
consider and behold our reproch.

REmember now, O Lord our God,
what is come us upon,
Consider also our reproch,
and it behold anone.

2 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our
houses to alients.
3 We are Orphans and fatherlesse, our mo|thers
are as widows.

2
To strangers turnd's our heritage,
our house to aliants far:


3
We Orphans are and Fatherlesse,
our mothers widows are.

4 We have drunken our water for money,
our wood is sold unto us.
5 Our necks are under persecution: we la|bour
and have no rest.

4
For money we our water drink,
our wood is sold to us:


5
Our necks under affliction are
we restlesse labour thus.

6 We have given the hand to the Egyptians,
and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.

6
We unto the Egyptians
have giv'n the hand in need,

And to th' Assyrians, for to be
but satisfi'd with bread.

7 Our fathers have sinned and are not, and
e have born their iniquities.
8 Servants have ruled over us: there is
ne that doth deliver us out of their hand.

Sinn'd have our fathers, and are not,
and born their sins we have,


Ov'r us rul'd servants, and none doth
out of their hand us save.

9 We gat our bread with the perill of our
, because of the sword of the wildernesse.

With perill of our lives we gat
our bread in great distresse,
ecause of the most bloody sword
that was in wildernesse.

10 Our skin was black like an oven, because
the terrible famine.
11 They ravished the women in Zion, and
maids in the cities of Iudah.


Our skin for famine terrible
like as ne ov'n was black,


They Zions women, Judahs maids
by ravishing did take.

12 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the
es of elders were not honoured.


12
Up by their hand most cruelly
the Princes hang'd are there,
The faces of the Elders als
by no man honourd were

13 They took the young men to grinde, an
the children fell under the wood.
14 The elders have ceased from the gate, th
young men from their musick.

13
They took the young men for to grind
boyes under wood did fall,


14
The Elders ceased from the gate,
from musick young men all.

15 The joy of our heart is ceased, our da
is turned into mourning.
16 The crown is fallen from our head: 
unto us that we have sinned.

15
Joy of our heart it ceased is,
our dance to mourning's trned,


16
The crown is fallen from our head,
woe's us that we have sinned.

17 For this our heart is faint, for these thi
our eyes are dim.
18 Because of the mountain of Zion, which
desolae, the foxes walk upon it.

17
For this our heart is faint, our eyes
are dim for things so done,


18
For Zions hill that's desolate,
it foxes walk upon.


19 Thou, O Lord, remainest for ever: thy
rone from generation to generation.

19
Thou who art the most mighty Lord
remainst for ever fast:
hy Throne from generation doth
to generation last.

20 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,
d forsake us so long time?
21 Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we
ll be turned:


 Why us forgetst thou still and als
so long forsak'st us all:


Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord,
and turned be we shall:

 Renew our dayes as of old.
22 But thou hast utterly rejected us: thou art
 wroth against us.
 as of old renew our dayes:

22
But utterly thou both
 us rejected, and thou art
with us exceeding wroth.




The Song of Ionah, for his deliverance
out of the belly of the Whale.
Jonah. 2. vers. 2.
ryed by reason of mine affliction unto the
ord, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell
 I, and thou heardest my voice.


BY reason of my trouble I
to God who heard me cry'd,
Out of hells belly did I cry,
thou heardst my voice I try'd.

2 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in 
midst of the seas, and the flouds compassed me 
bout, all thy billows and thy waves passed over 

2
For thou hadst cast me in the deep,
in midst ev'n of the sea,
Floods compassde me, thy billows all
and waves past over me.

3 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sig
yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.

3
Then said I, I out of thy sight
am cast with great disdain,
Yet to thy holy temple I
at last will look again.

4 The waters compassed me about eve
the soul: the depth closed me round about, 
weeds were wrapt about my head.

4
The waters compassde me about
ev'n to the soul indeed,
The depth me closd about, and weeds
were wrapt about my head.

5 I went down to the bottoms of the 
ains; the earth with her bars was abo
for ever:


Ev'n to the bottomes I went down
of mountains high that be,
ikewise the earth was with her barres
for ever about me.

Yet hast thou brought up my life from corru|ption,
O Lord my God.

et thou who art the Lord my God,
now by thy power alone
y life in danger great hast brought
up from corruption.

6 When my soul fainted within me, I re|mbred
the Lord, and my prayer came in unto
ee, in thine holy temple.

The Lord I did remember when
my soul did faint in me,
to thy holy Temple came
my prayer unto thee

7 They that observe lying vanities, forsake
eir own mercy.

They that do lying vanities
observe in any way.
he mercy then that is their own
they do forsake alway.

8 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the
ice of thanksgiving, I will pay that that I have
wed: salvation is of the Lord.

But I to thee with voice of thanks
will sacrifice afford,

I will what I have vowed pay;
salvation's of the Lord.



The Song and prayer of Habbakkuk,
upon Sigionoth.
HABAK. 3. vers. 2.
I Have heard thy speach and was afraid,: 
Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the year
in the midst of the years make known; in wr
remember mercie.

I Heard thy speach, and was afraid,
in midst of years on earth,
Revive thy work, Lord make it known
on mercy think in wrath.

2 God came from Teman, and the holy 
from mount Paran. Selah. His glorie covere
the heavens, and the earth was full of his prai

2
From Teman and from Paran mou
came God the holy One, Selah.
His glory cov'rd the heavens, his praise
fill'd all the earth anone,

3 And his brightnes was as the light, he 
horns coming out of his hand, and there w
the biding of his power.

3
His brightnesse als was as the light,
out of his hand moreover
He horns had comming, and there was
the hiding of his power.


4 Before him went the pestilence, and burn|ng
coals went forth at his feet.
5 He stood and measured the earth:

4
Before him went the pest, and coals
went burning from his feet;


5
He stood and also measured
the earth as was most meet:

He beheld and drove asunder the ations, and
he everlasting mountains were scattered, the per|ctuall
hills did bowe: his wayes are ever|lasting.

He look'd and sunder nations drove,
old mountains scattred were,
The hills perpetuall did bowe,
his wayes eternall are.

6 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction:
and the curtains of the land of Midian did
tremble.

6
The tents of Cushan I did see
under affliction;
The curtains of the Midian land
did tremble evry one.

7 Was the Lord displeased against the rivers?
was thine anger against the rivers?

7
Was the displeasure of the Lord
made 'gainst the rivers fall?
Or was thine anger that is great
against the rivers all?


Was thy wrath against the sea, that tho
didst ride upon thine horses, and thy chariots o
salvation?

Or was thy wrath against the sea
that thou didst ride upon
Thine horses and the chariots
of thy salvation?

8 Thy bow was made quite naked, accor|ding
to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word,
Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.

8
Thy bow was made quite naked as
thou oaths to tribes didst give,
Ev'n thine own word; thou also didst
the earth with rivers cleave.

9 The mountains saw thee, and they trem|bled;
the overflowing of the water passed by
the deep uttered his voice, and lift up his hands
on high.

9
The hils thee saw, and trembled all,
great waters passed by,
The deep his voice did utter then,
and lift his hands on hy.

10 The Sun and Moon stood still in their
habitations: at the light of thine arrows they
went, and at the shining of thy glittering
spear,

10
The Sun and Moon stood where they dwelt,
of those thine arrows clear,

They at the sight went, and the shine
of thy most glittring spear.

11 Thou didst march through the land in in|dignation,
thou didst thresh the heathen in
anger.

11
Thou in thine indignation
through all the land didst presse,
And als the heathen people thou
didst in thine anger thresh.

12 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of
thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed,

12
Thou of thy people wentest forth
for the salvation:
Yea ev'n for the salvation great
with thine Anointed One,

Thou woundest the head out of the house of
the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto
the neck. Selah.

Out of the house of wicked men
thou diddest wound the head,
Discov'ring the foundation
unto the neck with speed.
Selah.

13 Thou didst strike through with his staves
the head of his villages: they came out as a
whirlewinde to scatter me:

13
Thou through his village heads didst strike
with staves of his that be,

They as a whirlewind did come out,
and that to scatter me:

Their rejoycing was as to devour the poor
secretly.
14 Thou didst walk through the sea with
thine horses through the heap of great waters.

Their joy it was as to devore
the poor man secretlie:


14
Through heaps of water great thou walkst
with horses through the sea.

15 When I heard, my belly trembled: my
lips quivered at the voice: rottennes entred into
my bones,

15
My belly trembled when I heard.
and at the voice anone
My lips did quiver, rottenesse
did enter in my bone:

And I trembled in my self, that I might
rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up
unto the people, he will invade them with his
troups.

I trembled in my self, that I
might rest in dayes most sad,
When he up to the people comes
with troups he'le them invade.

16 Although the fig-tree shall not blosso
neither shall fruit be in the vines, the labou
of the olive shall fail,


16
Though that the fig-tree blossome not
nor fruit in vines shall be,
The labour of the olive fa
shall fail as all shall see.

And the fields shall yeeld no meat, the flock
shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall
be no herd in the stalls:

The fields shall not yeeld any meat,
the flock als from the fold
Shall be cut off, there shall no herd
in stals be young or old.

17 Yet will I rejoice in the Lord, I will joy
in the God of my salvation.

17
Yet I in him will now rejoice
who is the Lord alone,
I also joy will in the God
of my salvation.

18 The Lord God is my strength, and he will
make my feet like hindes feet, and he will make
me to walk upon mine high places.

18
The Lord my God hs is my strength,
he'le make my feet to be
Like seet of Hindes, he'le make me walk
upon my places hie.




The Song of Mary, after Elizabeth told he
that at her salutation the child in her wo
leaped for joy. Luk. 1. 46.
MY soul doth magnifie the Lord,
2 And my spirit hath rejoiced in Go
my Saviour.

MY soul now with all gladnesse fill'
the Lord doth magnifie,


2
My sprit rejoiced hath in God
a Saviour for me.

3 For he hath regarded the low estate of h
handmaiden: for behold, from henceforth all gnerations
shall call me blessed.

3
For of his handmaid he did so
regard the state so small,
For lo, all generations me
from henceforth blest shall call.

4 For he that is mighty hath done to me grea
things, and holy is his name.
5 And his mercy is on them that fear him
from generation to generation.

4
He mighty did great things to me,
and holy is his Name:


5
They that him fear from race to race,
his mercie have on them.

6 He hath shewed strength with his arm, h
hath scattered the proud, in the inmagination o
their hearts.


6
He with his arme hath shewed strength,
the proud he in all parts
In the imagination
hath scattered of their hearts.

7 He hath put down the mighty from their
seats, and exalted them of low degree.

7
He hath put down ev'n from their seats
those that most mighty be,
And also he exalted hath
them of a low degree.

8 He hath filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he hath sent empty away.

8
Them that are hungry he hath fill'd
with good things evry way,
And those that rich are also he
hath empty sent away.

9 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in re|membrance
of his mercy.
10 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham,
and to his seed for ever.

9
He helpt his servant Israel,

10
As he unto our fathers spake;
t'Abr'am and's seed for ever.




The Song of Zacharias after he had been nine
moneths dumb for not believing the angel
Gabriel. Luk. 1. vers. 68.
BLessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he
hath visited and redeemed his people,

THe Lord the God of Israel
for ever blessed be,
For that his people visited
and als redeem'd hath he.

2 And hath raised up an horn of salvation
for us, in the house of his servant David.

2
And of salvation he for us
hath raised up on hy
A glorious horn in Davids house,
who serv'd him faithfully.

3 As he spake by the mouth of his holy pro|phets,
which have been since the world began.

3
As by the mouth of those that were
his holy prophets than,
Which have among his people been
ev'n since the world began.

4 That we should be saved from our ene|mies,
and from the hand of all that hate us.

4
That from those that our enemies are
we should be saved heer;
And likewise from the hand of all
that hatred to us bear.


5 To perform the mercy promised to our
fathers, and to remember his holy covenant.

5
The mercies promisd to perform
unto our fathers ever,
And als his holy Covenant
made with them to remember.

6 The oath which he sware to our father
Abraham,
7 That he would grant unto us, that we be|ing
delivered out of the hands of our enemies,

6
The oath which unto Abraham
our father then he sware:


7
That he would grant that we from those
sav'd that our enemies are,

Might serve him without fear.
8 In holinesse and righteousnesse before him,
all the dayes of our life.
Without all fear so might him serve,

8
In holinesse alwayes
And righteousnesse before him als
of our life all the dayes

9 And thou childe shalt be called the prophet
of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the
face of the Lord, to prepare his wayes;

9
And thou O child shalt called be
the Highests prophet rare.
For thou before the Lord shalt go,
his wayes for to prepare.


10 To give knowledge of salvation unto 
people, by the remission of their sins.

10
That so he might the knowledge give
of his salvation
Unto his people, by their sins
most free remission.

11 Through the tender mercie of our God
whereby the day-spring from on high hath visited
us,

11
Ev'n through the mercy of our God
that tender is, whereby
Us on the earth hath visited
the DAY-SPRING from on hy.

12 To give light to them that sit in darknesse,
and in the shadow of death, to guide ou
feet into the way of peace.

12
To light them that in darknesse sit,
and in death shade abide,
Into the way of holy peace
our feet there for to guide.



The Song of SIMEON.
Luke 2. vers. 29.
LOrd now lettest thou thy servant depart

NOw in thy mercy lettest thou

2 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation:
3 Which thou hast prepared before the face
of all people,

2
For thy salvation mine eyes
have seen for great and small,


3
Which thou prepared hast before
the face of people all.

4 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the
glory of thy people Israel.

4
A precious light to lighten all
the Gentiles far and neer,
And als the glory of Isra'l
that is thy people dear.

Georgii Buchanani hymnus
Matutinus ad Christum.
PRoles parentis optimi,
Et par parenti maximo,
De luce ver vera lux;
Verusque de Deo Deus:
En nox recessit jam nitet
Aurora luce praevi
Coelum solumque purpurans:
Et clausa tenebris detegens;
Sed fuscat ignorantiae
Caligo nostra pectora,
Et nubilis erroribus
Mens pen cedit obruta.
Exurge sol purissime,
Diemque da mundo suum:
Nostram noctem illuminans
Erroris umbram discute.
Dissolve frigus horridum,
Arvumque nostri pectoris,
Calore lampadis tuae,
Humore purganoxio:
Ut irrigetur coelitus
Roris beati nectare,
Et centuplo cum foenore
Coeleste semen proferat.



A Morning Hymne
for CHRIST.

O Day spring from on hy
Cause passe away our night,
Clear first our morning sky,
And after shine thou bright:


2
Of lights thou art the Light
Of righteousnesse the Sun,
Thy beams they are most bright,
Through all the world they run:


3
The day thou hast begun,
Thou wilt it clearer make,
Wee hope to see this Sun
High in our Zodiack.


4
And there he beames shall shake,
Of a most golden hew,
Which fading flowrs shall make
Their colours to renew.


5
O make thy morning dew

To fall without all cease,
Do thou such favour shew
As unto Gideons fleece.


6
O do thou never cease,
To make that dew to fall
The dew of grace and peace,
And joyes celestiall.


7
This morning we do call
Upon thy Name divine,
That thou among us all
Cause thine Aurora shine.


8
Let shadows all decline
And wholly passe away,
That light which is divine.
May bring to us our day.


9
A day to shine for ay,
A day that is most bright;
A day that never may
Be follow'd with a night.


10
O of all lights the light,
The light that is most true,
Now banish thou our night,
And still our light renew.


11
Thy face now to us shew,
O Son of God most dear,
O Morning Star most true
Make thou our darknesse clear.


12
Nothing at all is heer

That with thee can compare,
 unto us draw near,
And us thy children spare.


13
Thy mercies they are rare
f they were understood,
rath due to us thou bare
And for us shed thy blood.


14
Like beasts they are most rude,
Whom reason cannot move;
Who do not for thy good
Thee most entirely love.


15
Make us mind things above,
Ev'n things that most excell,
Of thine untainted love
Give us the sacred seal.


16
In mercy with us deale,
And all our sins remove,
Thy self to us reveale,
And this our song approve,


17
Us in thy mercy move
To walk still in thy way
First make us sick of love,
And then with flagons stay.


18
Let us not go astray
To wander far from thee,
Thou art the onely way
To joyes that lasting be,


19
O that we light could see.

That shineth in thy face,
So at the last should we
To glory go from grace;


20
Within thy sacred place,
Is only true content,
Where God's seen face to face
Above the firmament.


21
O that our hours were spent
Among the sons of men,
To praise th' Omnipotent!
Amen, yea, and Amen.

FINIS.
