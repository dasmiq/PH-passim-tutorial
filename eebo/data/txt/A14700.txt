 To the ryght honorable and my syngular good ldrde and mayster, syr Anthony Sentleger knyght, of the moost honourable order of the garter, one of the gentlemen of the kynges hyghnes moost honou|rable priuie chamber, and lorde deputie of Irelande.
_BEYNGE so ma|ny wayes bounde vnto your lorde|shyp, for the most gracious, bountie and munifycence, which in the tyme of my greuous calamitie you haue vnto me exte~|ded. I thought it shulde be noted in me a poynt of muche ingrati|tude, to be so longe absent from my countrey without hauynge to

you therfore due officious tha~kes. wherfore I haue deuised to prese~t your honour with this my poore lucubracio~. That y^e same maye be an exa~ple of my assiduous study, and desyre to accomplysh the due|tye, wherewith your lordeshyppe haue me so often bou~de.

In the one respecte I take it to be a gyfte nedefull for me to gyue.
And in the other (for this present tyme) somewhat apt for your wise dome to receyue. That the same beinge perused, corrected, and set

forth by your honour maye haue creadite with al men, the more ver+tuouslye to do their most bounden deutie, euen in fyghtynge for their contrey, as the sapient Cato doth counsell. In my most humble ma|ner besechynge your honourable lordeshyppe to note therein not my temerious audacite and rude|nes, but my wyllynge harte to do my duetie for my parte  to swade other, in y^t I may to do the lyke. I haue constrayned this litle worke to more brefnes then I ought, le|uyng out the examples and histo|ryes, wherof your lordeshyppe is so well fulcome, that I feared the readinge of them shulde be to you somewhat tedyous: notwithstan|dynge I knowe ryght well the re|hearsall of them shulde adde to my worke no lyttle coulloure of perswasyon: whych thyng I efte|sones

beseche youre wysedome to accepte accordynglye, bese|chynge almyghty god to sende you most hartely well to fare.

Trustynge that thereby, the zele that nature hathe in me kendled towarde my countreye, may apere in me not onelye inextynguyble, but also alwayes vygylante and cyrcumspecte for the good and commodytye of the same.

why then, consideringe that by the exemple of our fathers we ought to be alwayes thankefull for oure nutricion. Shuld we not accumu|late and heape our thankes and officious dueties to oure natyue contrey, by whose ayde moost prin cipally we were not onely produ|ced and nouryshed, but also preserHiis ma|lis infan|tes obno|xii sunt maxime. ued when we coulde neither speke nor go nor yet of our selues euite y^e peryll of fyre water yron or such lyke daungerous thinge, whereby we myght peryshe in our infancy.

In our countrey we fyrste dyd beholde the most beautyfull bryghtnes of the sonne, which the euerlastyng god hath so disposed to the vse of man, that beynge co~|mon to al y^t nacions of the earth, it extendeth beames and lyght, as though the same were propre to eche countreye: wherein the worke manshyp of god appereth to be e|quall vnto vs his sapience, excea|dinge the iudgement of man. Out of her wombe dyd ebullulate andBaptiza|mur in pa tria. sprynge the water wherewith the most heauenly ceremonie through which we are called christia~s was in vs perfourmed. By her benefit the rude feldis of oure vnderstan dyng, readie to growe w^t all kynd of vnclene thinges, were sowed with y^e diuine precepts of y^ gospel without the instructions whereof

we shulde be as thinfideles that do not knowe god, who can there|fore repende condigne offyce or tha~ke though we dyd study payn|fully for the same. And as the fa|mousLucianus in opuscu|lo de pa|trie enco|mio. auctor Lucian sayeth, there is nothinge in this worlde, so ho|nourable, or so godly, whereof the goodnes of the natiue contrey is not in some respecte a maistres,  an occasion. Nether can we name the commoditie, the pleasure, the qualitie, the honoure or any other good thynge wherof the natyue countrey is not to be thanked. Ye though our contrey were in dede so baraign, as that she shuld nede the fruytes of other realmes andA contra|tii obiec|tione. so rude of tonge, y^e in treatinge of weyghtie matters we shulde nede the ayde of estraunge languages: yet resteth in her as in y^e originall and principall a great occasion of

thankes and immortall prayses. Moreouer let vs considre the ve|ry instruct of nature that workethNatura. vniuersally in all men, who was euer so vnnatural, ye though he ex celled many in auctoritie  power in the straunge contreye, to be de|lired with the pleasant and volup tuos contemplacion of the co~passe and riches of grat cyties, y^e costly buyldynge of edificis, or any lyke blandiment, that he wolde totally forget his natiue contrey? Perad|uenture in the comparison or wey|inge together of the goodnes of countrayes or famous cities, men wyll haue sometyme consyderacio~  respecte to theyr amplitude, ele|gance, plentifulnes  riches. But nowe at all y^e nature hath rightly educed, wyll chose for him felfe a more mete place to dwell in, then his natyue conntreye: preferryng

the same w^e all her faultes, to al y^e copious  rych places of y^e world. Thus do the legitimate  trewe children. Thus do the fathers al|so that be honest, good, and rygh|tuous. A chylde certis hauynge any respecte of humanitie wil not prefer in honour any mortal crea|ture to his father, nor the fatherMutuum parentum  filiorum officium. embrace with more fatherly affec|tion any yonglynge before his na turall chylde, yf then we owe due honour, to oure fathers as by theHonora patrem et matrem. very commaundement of god we are bounde, howe great study and industry is requisite of vs to forse that no wrake or euyll maye come to our natiue contrey, wherin our fathers are preserued and kepte, howe can it be sayde, that we do due honour to our fathers, yf suf|ferynge a permcyous myscheyf to growe agaynst our common wele

that successiuely maye destroye the same: we spare our bodyes or goodes to take it awaye, and to establyshe a certayne order therin accordinglye: yf we be bounde toLocus a fortiore. oure fathers, we be moche more bounde to our lynnage, and so per quensequently to oure countrey, where they are conserued. You maye beholde the aged man, who all his lyfe tyme hath lyued sump tuouslye, reiectynge all maner the commodite ease and pleasour that he hath in the straunge countreye howe he wissheth most instantlye in his natiue countrey euen to re|pose his bodye as it were on the brest of his naturall mother: yea nature worketh with such fearce in men that whyle they suspecte them selues to be deprehended in an vnked contrey thinkynge ther to be buryed and turned to y^e dust

they can not but euermore desyre to departe. And the more we haue sene men come to the opinion of wysedome and to the nomber of yeares, the more subiectes they se|med to be to this affectio~ that you haue herde here rehersed. ye anye aliant or straunger, that lyke a bastarde or spurious vilipendeth the name of his natiue countrey, estemynge exile a small matter,  lyke a glotten reposinge his felici tie in the stinkynge and bestly vo luptuousnes of the body, and the vile pleasours of y^e same, yeldinge his industrye to satisfye concupis|cence, without studie charge or co~|sideracion of the wele of his coun trey, is in no wise to be prosecuted with thargument of a gentle and regratifieng harte. Moreouer the goddis (as poetes do fayne) do delite in their natiue conntrey,

Who, as Lucyan sayeth, behol|dynge the whole possessions ofLucianus men with the compas of the earth and occean: and knowynge them selues, as they write to be owners thereof: yet euery of them prefer|reth with more inwarde affection his natiue cou~trey then any other place of the worlde w^tout respecte. Whose opinion I haue here to you rehersed, to thende onely that the affection, which is borne from the beginnigne to the natiue con|trey, maye appere to you thereby. But let vs haue oure recourse to the holy scripture, which is farre from the faynige of poetes, and considre we that is sayde of our sa uiour Iesus christe the verye ow|ner and redemer of the worlde, wherof the holy prophet MicheasMiche. 5. enspired with the spirite of god re kenynge with him self the honour

due of all men to their natiue cou~|trey sayeth these wordes folowing which the holy euangelyste Ma|theweMathei. 2 reherseth in his seconde chapter. Thou bethleem sayth he, of the lande of Iuda, arte not the lest amonge the princis of Iuda: for out the shall there come vnto me y^e captayne that shall rule my people Israel: yf the holy prophet of god did note such respect in ourA fortiore sauyoure Iesus Chryste whiche doutles in that he was man, was in hym aswell assyduous as fer|ueut. The scripture testyfyeth theLuce 19. Io. 11. same by that he so tenderlye dyd wepe for the dissolation of Ieru|salem, and sundreye other exem|ples whiche at this presente I neade not to rehearse. What in|humayne, yea rather what bestly instyncte shulde rule in vs yf we shulde haue no affectyon of loue

risynge in oure hartes to our na|tiue countrey, whose fathers and whole generacion and progenie is earthy  of the erth , who as you haue harde receaue so many offi|cious co~modities by her only bene fite. In this place by occasion of y^e matter wherof I treate, I am cau sed to reme~ber y^e moost detestable vilenie of Delapole, Path, Gar|rotDelapole Path.

But also w^t most execra|ble  vngodly ingnominie haue wrought most falsely  trayterous ly against y^e same. How be it lest I shuld seme i~ their vituperie which no tunge can condingly vtter to digresse from my purposed mat|ter, I leue to them for a perpetual torment to their hartes the same whiche the makers of the lawes

haue ordeyned to punish greuous offendours, euen exile. And for an euerlastinge exemple of their con|tumely the, most excellent benefi|tes whiche they haue receaued of their sayde natyue countrey, to be co~trepeysed in the sight of all the worlde with their abhominable in gratitude  vnthankfulnes. Let|tynge you to witte that who so e|uer offendeth in y^e like trespas, not onely breketh the bounde of al hu+manitie and gratitude, falleth fro~ the high degre of liberty, renegeth for euer to runne in the race of ho+nour, but also transgresseth y^e high institution and prouidence of god wherwithby inexplicable prescie~ce he hath ordeyned, and constitued eche man to lyue vnder y^e powers of the earth as it is written in di|uerse et 17  Ro. 13 Sapien. 6 places of the holy euangelye we can not be therof ingnoraunt:

not vnder such powers as we our selues shall chose or desyre, either through our blynde affections or otherwise: for he by the wounder|ful depte of his wisedome  his in uestigable wayes of for knowe|ledge, before we came to y^e world, hath ordeyned prouyded and ap|poynted for vs, expresly that we ought in that behalfe to obserue and folow: in shewyng our duety to our natiue cou~trey without we shuld after the maner of gyau~tes, as sayth the Prouerbe fyght a|gainstCum diis pugnare. god,  worke against his be hestes. It may be well appercea|ued by this hyghe prouydence of god y^t among al tra~sitory thinges we are principally bounde to our natiue countreye, And also that itEpilogus primi capi tis. maye not lye in vs to chaunge y^t god hath appoynted the same be|inge euen the verye fyrste gyfte y^e

And miserably complayning their infortunate and wretched lyfe, for that they inhabite not their na|tyue

The AcaA caman|tide. mantians also remembrynge the verse of Homer, howe the immor|tal prince Acamans did sayle into Troye for the saluegarde of his mother thought it shulde be re|quisite in them to bestowe theyr mortall carcaise for their countrey the same beynge the conseruatrice of all their parentes and progenie from the first of them to the last.

whiche no volume can co~prehe~de, were the same by any oratour ex|plicable. ye why shulde we not be euen determined like men to fight for lyfe  death, rather the~ lyuing to se that princely dignitie, that e|uangelical gouernaunce defaced, which the very prouidence of god hath giuen to vs not to thende we shuld permit the same to be by our enemies forfrushed and brought to nought, but that we shulde ver tuouslye stande in the defence and mayntenaunce thereof in all fideli tie trouth and singlenes of mynde As the lawe of nature, the bondeerota|tio of loue wherewith our natiue cou~ treye hath bounde vs, the exemple of the princely dexteritie of our no ble kynge and his highnes noble progenitours. And also the verye worde of god in so manye places doth incite and perswade vs to do

And finally lest we shuld be inferi ours to thinfideles whose magna nimitie I haue here to your parte ly declared, I most te~derly exhorte you euen with the wordes of saint Paule: let eche of vs possesse his bodie in all holynes and honour not in sustayninge dishonour as thoughe we knewe not god ye as though we had no hope, or knewe not these thinges that you haue herde of the officious and plenti|full goodnes of our natiue coun|treye. Which I doubt not hath ef|ficace strengthe and energie to chaunge the very cowarde harte to be hardie bolde and coragious in folowynge the precepte of the sapiente Cato, euen to fyght for the natyue countrey. And not with standynge that by the rehersal vn to you of histories of noble men this proposicion shulde haue the

strong collection of argumentes, for our small laysar, let this that I haue sayd be vn to you for this tyme sufficient.
