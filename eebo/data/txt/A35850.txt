The Word of the Lord, To his beloved Citty
New-Ierusalem, come from God, cloathed with
the excellency of the Glory of his Love; and is
the Bride the Lambs Wife, with the Flowings of
the tender compassionate bowels of the Lord Iesus,
to all the Mourners in Sion, and the afflicted
desolate People, who waite for his comming as for
the Morning, and hath not satisfaction
in any thing but in the enjoyment of
his sweet and comfortable
presence.
OH Ierusalem, thou beloved amongst the People, who art
become the beautifull Bride the Lambs Wife; Oh
how did he seek thee in the day of thy Devorce|ment,
when thou wast weeping in the barren wildernesse, as a
desolate widdow, who had not any to comfort thee, when thy
greatest mournings and breakings of heart were thy greatest
comfort? And the more thou drunk the tears that was shed for
the want of him, was thy greatest satisfaction: Oh the weary
dayes thou had'st upon the Earth, because thy languishing
soul knew not where to meet with thy beloved, neither did'st
thou know how to walk in the steps of the Flock of thy com|panions,
who was comforted with his presence, whom thy soul
wanted: Then was he neer unto thee (though thou knew it
not) enlivening the desires that was towards his Name. And
in the acceptable day he sent forth whom he had ordained,
to declare unto thee the glory of his love, in the light of his
own life, in which he hath covered thee this day as with a wed|ding

garment, and in it thou appears comely in his sight, and
acceptable in his presence. And for thy sake, O Ierusalem,
thou City of the Living God, what hath been endured? how
many innocent Lambs have suffered? it's hard to be expres|sed,
to bring glad tidings unto thee of him whom thy soul
thirsteth after? How have the striplings sent out in Gods
Authority, run too and fro in the earth, willing to spend, and
be spent, in all services of love, to perswade thee to forsake
all that hath intangled thy mind, and hindered thee from the
innocent life of thy beloved. Thy mighty men, with many of
the Sons and Daughters of glory, hath sealed their living
testimony with their blood, in the patience and sufferings of,
the Lmb of God, that thou mayst be affected with the ex|cellency
of the glory of him whom thy soul desireth.
And now the Lord God requireth of every particular Son
and Daughter of Sion, To Watch and Pray, that not any enter
into temptation; and all that have any stain upon their gar|ment,
come to the Fountain which is opened for Iudah and Ie|rusalem
to wash in, which is the heart breaking love of God
manifest in the light of the Covenant, and sealed up to the
soul in the blood of Jesus.
Oh come away, come away, out of all your thoughts, desires,
doubts, and unbelife, which would turn you aside from the
enjoyment of the dear love of God in Christ Jesus: Let not
any stand afar off, because of your littleness, lameness, blind|ness,
weakness, and infirmities, who cannot live at peace, un|till
you be healed with the blood of the Lambe.
Arise, arise, you necessitated people, in the light of the
Lord, give up to the drawing spirit of Life in the light of
Iesus Christ, he will carry thee (that cannot go) in the Arms of
his Compassions; he will cause the Lame to walk, and thou
that art sensible of thy blindness, to recover thy sight; yea, he

will heal thee of all thy infirmities, who in the Light waits
as a little Child to be ordered and guided in the washing and
sanctifying Spirit of the Lord Iesus, who is become a Husband
to the desolate Widdow, and a repairer of the breaches, and a
restorer of the desolate places, in whom the fatherlesse hath
found mercy this day, for his names sake.
Oh! what shall I say of the unspeakable love of God in
Christ Iesus the Husband of the Bride, the Lambs Wife?
Oh ye Sonnes of the glorious day, reade, and feel in the
deep tasts of the unsearchable love. And you Hand-maids
of Glory, drink of the inexpressable Ocean, which flowes
in the Light over all opposition. This is the Son of the Fa|thers
love, who hath been a man of sorrows, and acquainted
with griefs, He was wounded for our transgressions, and by his
stripes are we healed, and this is the work of the Lord: Let all
Crownes be thrown down before him, for he alone shall have
all the glory, besides him there is no other. Therefore in the
measure of him, let every Son, Daughter, and servant of God
watch, and diligently hearken to his Councel, and what ever
the naturall man most inclines to, when the temptation be|sets
you, judge your selves, look up to the Lord, and resist the
Devill with boldness in the first assault, and the Lord God
will give you Dominion over him, and the bond of iniquity
shall not have power over you, and in his holy authority,
every one stand in Dominion upon the head of the first man,
with all his excellency and glory, that in perfect freedom
every perticular Reign, in the measure of the Light, over
every thought and desire that is contrary to the will of God,
that in his eternall will, you Sons and Daughters of the most
high, you all dwell in the holy faith, which will evidence
to you beyond your sight, and will arm you against all the
fiery darts of the Devill: And you shall tread down Satan

under your feet, and in the triumphing Dominion, through
the blood of the Lambe, and word of your testimony, you
shall overcome, and continually drink of the Rivers of plea|sures
which is the presence of the Lord Iesus, our Light
Life, and righteousnesse for ever; for he is become our Hus|band,
and we are as the wife of his bosome, in the delight of
his glorious love; Let the Mourners in Sion rejoyce, and the
afflicted among the people be glad, and feare the Lord. And let
not any say, The Lord regards me not, who desires salvation in
uprightness of heart; for what ever thou hungers and thirsts
for in his life, thou art the Heire of it, and the Lord will sa|tisfie
thy hunger with his refreshings for his names sake: And
this is the portion, of them that are least in their own Eyes
amongst the people, The Lord hath spoken it.
And all you Inhabitants of the City of the great God,
whom the Lord hath prospered in your living testimony, in
what he hath called unto, blessed be the Lord God for you who
retains the sencibility of your nothingness in self, and so becoms
poor with the poorest, and weak with the weakest, and truely maketh
self of no reputation, but humbles it to the Cross, and doh not
serve self, but the Lord and his people, with all his gifts and
ornaments, with which he hath adorned you, because of the savour
of this Oyntment which you have in Christ, causes the soules of all
the upright in heart to prayse the Lord for you; Oh your stedfast
valiant unwearied travells, labour and sufferings for the Lord,
causes the hearts of his people to be enlarged with Hallelujahs, and
high prayses in the holy assembles of his Saints, you know your
reward is with you; and woe to them that devise mischief against
you whom the Lord hath blessed.
Oh Sion Children, from the least to the greatest, love the
Lord Iesus Christ, and let not a thought of the heart have any
power that would draw from the Light, Life, and Love of

the Lord Iesus; Let the day of the Resurrection arise upon you,
which will set your souls in perfect love, above all unbeliefe and
infidelity. Oh drink, drink, drink, to the full satisfaction of your
soules of the cup of his salvation, for it is freely handed to all
that love him, and thirsts for his mercies, and trample and tread
down the selfe working spirit, that all be bound down in silence,
and kept in the death that would move in any exercise to utter
words rashly before the Lord; but in the resurrection, light,
power, life, and innocent birth enter the Kingdom, and Reigne
in the Dominion thereof. Oh, here my dear friends, let us com|fort
and consolate our souls together, for this is our beloved, and
we have waited for him, and now is he come with power, and
great glory, to deliver his Captives, and establish them in his
glorious freedom, where the evill one shall not prevail against
them, and to marry the soule unto himself, who hath waited for
him as for the Morning; And all in the Marriage union feel
his power abounding to leade in the dayly Cross, to stand over
all that would draw from the sweet union, that is in the footsteps
of the flock of his Companions, who walks in the Light; and stir
up the gift of God in you, in all faithfull obedience, to meet to|gether
in true watchfulness to wait in the Light: And as your
hearts are filled with the heavenly power of the Lord, and broken
in the sence of the over commings of his life, and moved in the
forceable strength thereof, in any exercise, in your Families, or
in the Assemblies of his people; quench not the Spirit, of the
Lord, but be obedient, and keep within the bounds of a broken
heart and a contrite Spirit, which is a Sacrifice acceptable in
his presence: And all feel the love of God inlarging your
hearts one to another, that the strong may bear the burthen of the
weak, and in the pure life of love, you may grow fruitfull Plants
in the Vineyard which Gods right hand hath Planted, c.

And as for our little Sister, (which is scattered amongst the
people in the Nations) that hath no breast of Consolation,
her broken Cisternes hath fayled her: What shall we do,
in this day she shall be spoken for, which is come upon us,
though at present she cannot draw neer, but mourns at a di|stance,
and cryes in secret for want of the enjoyment of the
God of our salvation? Oh let your Bowels open to her, and
let your hearts breathe unto the Lord, that he may seale
his Counsell unto her, and cause her to walk in the Light of
the Lord with us, whom he hath raysed to be the first fruits
amongst many brethren, to bear his glorious testimony over
and above the heads of all the wrath of the Children of
men, that withstands the Appearance of God, who will
cause them to bow before his Glory; in the day he will
cleare the innocency of his beloved people; which shall
smite the hearts of them that know him not, neither by
Sword, nor Spear, nor strength of the Arme of Flesh, but
with the breath of his mouth, and the brightnesse of his com|ming,
which shall spread his fame over the Nations, to
gather our Brethren from far, and Sisters from the ends of
the Earth; yea, the mighty shall bow to his Scepter, and
the Nations that are saved shall walk in his Light, with
us, whom he hath made as dear unto himself as the Apple
of his Eye; and though a woman may forget her sucking
Child, yet the Lord will not forget any that fear him; but
he will leade through all tribulations with joy in his hea|venly
power, untill we have finished our course with glad|nesse,
to the glory of the name of the Lord for ever. And
this is the Portion, and the Lot of thy Inheritance, thou
beautifull Bride, the Lambs Wife, against whom, every tongue
that is lifted up shall fall into judgement, and the weapons
formed against thee, shall not prosper; for the Lord hath

made thee a burthensome Stone to the Nations, and the
prayse of the whole Earth; and the desires of the people
shall be to the name of the most high God, who dwells in
the midst of thee, and hath displayed his Banner of Love
over thee, and hath turned his fury away from thee, and
never any more shall thou want the fresh springs of Life
who loves the Light, and bathes thy soule in the Ocean of
his inexpressable mercies: The Lord will keep thee in the
safety of his power, and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail
against any of the Sons and Daughters who walk in the
Light of thy City, O Ierusalem, in whom there is no more
curse, but the Throne of God, and of the Lambe is in thee,
and his servants doth serve him, and they doe see his Face,
and his Name is written in their Foreheads, and there is no
Night there, neither need of Candle, nor light of the Sunne,
for the Lord God giveth them Light, and they doe Reigne
for ever, as the Lord hath spoken.

in the tribulation and
Kingdom of patience in the
Lord Iesus, W. D.
