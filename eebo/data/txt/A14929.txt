ABRIDGEMENT
of all SEA-LAVVES.
Gathered forth of all
Writings and Monuments,
which are to be found among any
people or Nation, upon the coasts
of the great Ocean and Mediterra|nean
Sea.
And specially ordered and dispo|sed
for the use and benefit of all be|nevolent
Sea-farers, within his Maje|sties
Dominions of Great Brittain,
Ireland, and the adjacent Isles
thereof.

TO
THE HIGH AND
mighty Prince, Iames,
King of Great Brittaine,
France and Ireland,
c.
_IT pleased your M.
some yeers past,
most graciously
to accept of this
birth, in the great weakenesse
and in fancie thereof. Therefore

is it, that now being strong, and
by all warrants inarmed, it most
thankefully returnes, offering
service to your M. even for all
the coasts of your Highnesse do|minions,
upon hope to merit
your former grace.
Your M. most humble
subject, and daily orator,
W. Welwod.



To the right Honoura|ble,
LUDOVICK, Duke of
Lenox his Grace, c. Henry,
Earle of North-hampton, c. and
Charles, Earle of Notingham, c.
Lords Admiralls of England and
Ireland, of Scotland and the Iles,
and of the Cinque Ports.
_HAving intended a
painefull  new
labour, upon a
rare and necessa|ry
argument, as
for al Sea-farers,
so also properly pertaining to
your Honours, my most noble
Lords; I could not but of due sa|lute
your Honours, as the kee|pers

of Sea-lawes, for a refre|shing
remembrance, and need|full
consideration of that most
honourable estate and high of|fice,
presently, and (I hope) hap|pily
allotted unto you: I meane,
the Admiraltie of his M. domi|nions;
a charge both ancient
from many hundreth yeeres in
this Ile, and most honourable by
the personages your predeces|sors,
bearing the same: as being
all, either sonnes, brothers, un|cles,
or cousins to Princes, or (at
least) for action most famous.
With all the which, that your
Honours may the better ranke
and match, surely, as the condi|tion
of these daies craves, so the
best disposed wish, that as you be
every other way Noble, your no|bility
may be crownd with a care|full
attention to the speciall parts
of the Admiraltie requiring the

same, to a memoriall surpassing
all ancesters: I meane the con|servacy,
jurisdiction and privi|ledges
thereof. The jurisdiction,
albeit it bee most faithfully and
diligently exercised, and name|ly
in England by Sir Daniel
Dunn, and Doctor Trevor, most
learned, sincere, and worthy col|legues,
Iudges in the high court
there: yet the daily thwarting
and curbing of the processe of
the Iudicature, urges a clearing
or designing of the limits and
marches, to a better distingui|shing
thereof from all other ju|risdictions
ordinary; without
which, due justice can neither be
administred, concerning the sea
customes (of which no court else
can take knowledge) for stran|gers
traffiquing here (importing
no small staine to the King his
justice) nor yet for his M. lieges

traffiquers on sea, whose con|tracts
and charter-parties ordi|narily
beare the clause of ruling
by law of Olero; a forraine law,
as all the other lawes of the Ad|mirall
court commonly are,
whereof no other Iudicature
here can take cognissance.
To end this point; Beside that
which God in the heavens re|quires
of the ministers of justice,
please you to remember, that
here below amongst men, Nihil
justitia popularius. Consequently
therefore, the priviledges due
for the maintenance of the Ad|miraltie
and jurisdiction there|of,
would be vindicat from all
sort of encroching and usur|ping.
But above all, the conser|vacie
(as the chiefe point of that
office) requires security and safe|ty
in common for all loyall sub|jects,
traders on Sea: specially,

for Fishers and others, happily
disposed to adventure and exer|cise
the trade of fishing, to the
end, that not onely a peaceable,
but also a full and plentifull fi|shing
may bee enjoyed by the
inhabitants of his M. kingdomes,
even according to that which
God so freely and bountifully
offers into their very doors. For
which cause, the barbarity of the
Ilanders would be repressed, and
strangers stayed from scarring,
scattring, and breaking the shoals
of our fishes; namely, upon our
coasts of Scotland. There could
be no better employment for
some (at least) of his M. shippes
and companies, Ne vel illi usqu
turbent, aut isti intercipiant, quod
nos capere oportet.
But, I breake from this pur|pose,
remitting the same to the
27 Title of this booke; hoping

for a comfortable out-bearing
and maintaining of that necessa|ry
and great dignity of the Ad|miralty
by your LL. according
to all the occasions of these quar|relsome
times. And so I rest, by
this present token, devote to
serve your Honours in my cal|ling.
William Welwod.

The Proheme containing
the Origine of the Sea-law:
with the occasion of this
Treatise.
_COncerning the
Argument of
Sea-faring go|vernement,
so
farre as by any
monume~ts can be observed,
our beginning must be at the
inhabitants of the Iland cal|led
Rhode, situate within the
Mediterranean Sea, in the

part thereof called the Car|path
sea, upon the coast of
Asia minor, over against Ca|ria.
The indwellers where|of,
amongst all other people
we can reade of, were most
famous for shipping and
Sayling; and that not onely
to the great increase of their
power and wealth every
way, as by which they did
command and daunt all o|ther
people about their
coasts and seas; in such man|ner,
that neither Pirat, nor a|ny
sort of enemy, or distur|ber
of their peace and traf|fique,
durst then appeareGellius, lib. 7. Cap. 3.:
but also by the communica|ting

of their trade, and disci|pline
on sea, they did make
neighbour Princes, and Ci|ties,
willingly Tributars un|to
themStrab. geogr. lib. 12. cap. 14.. And further, as
Strabo writethIbid. to the crow|ning
of their renowne, they
surpassed all other Nations
in knowledge of equity in
marine businesse; which
they manifested by making
of Sea-lawes.
For, the very Emperors
of Rome, Tiberius Caesar,
Hadrian, Vespasian, Traian,
successively, did referre all
seafaring debates and con|troversies,
to the judgement
of the Rhodian law.Vide Il. Rho|dior. in prin. And

so likewise exemplarilie, did
their successor Antoninus, by
his rescript yet extantL. deprecatio ad L. Rhod. e c. rhodiae leges. distinct. 2.:
wherein, answering to one
Eudemon his plaint, I am
(saith he) the Lord of the
world, but the law is the ma|ster
of the sea; let that thy
plaint and controversie Eu|demon
be decided by the law
of the Rhodians.
So farre did the Romans
(who alwaies excelled all o|ther
Nations, in devising of
humane lawes) yeeld and
give place to the Rhodians in
the sea lawes.
And by their example,
finding sea-faring and tra|fique

on sea, redound to a
great common wealth, as
plainly pronouncedL. 1. sect. licet. de exerc. act. Vlpian,
one of the fathers of their
lawes; the Romane Empe|rours,
and namely Claudius,
Suet. ca. 218. brought in new formes of
actions, and devised a kinde
of new and sure commodi|ties
and gaine for trafiquers;
by taking upon them the
hazard of shippe and goods:
to which end also is erected
by English lawes, the office
of Assurance.
It is true, that the first ma|king
of Sea lawes, is other|wise
by some attributed to
others, as by Dionysius to

the Phenicians, because of
Merchant tradeDe situ orbis.. And Pli|nius,
for that same cause as|cribes
the Art of sayling to
the Carthaginians.Lib. 7. natur. histor. vide |zechiam. c. 27.. and con|sequently,
would seeme to
attribute to these two Na|tions
also for their necessi|tie,
the skill of sayling. To
be briefe, by the space of a
thousand yeeres, the sea, at
least the Mediterranean, was
onely ruled by the Rhodian
law, but helped with some
few additions by the Ro|mans,
and that by way of
interpretation: the rather, to
occurre to the deceits and
Sophistrie of calumniators

and wilfull vexers of their
neighbours, as also for o|ther
needfull doubtsDotimus in lib. suo legoli..
At last, when all sorts of
lawes by the eversion and
renting of the Romane Em|pire,
was as it were for a
long time buried, necessity
forced the Rulers of Rome,
Anno Dom. 1075. to make
new sea lawes and statutes:
and so successively, every
chiefe sea-faring towne up|on
the Mediterranean coast,
to adde other ordinances;
as they of Marseilles did,
Anno Dom. 1162. and they
of Genua, Anno Dom. 1186.
And they of Peloponnesus,

called Morea, Anno Dom.
1200. and the Common|wealth
of Venice, Anno Dom.
1215. And the Emperours
of Constantinople, Paleo|log.
Anno Dom. 1262. and
Constantine, 1270. and Iames
King of Aragon that same
yeere; and Peter King of
Aragon, Anno Dom. 1340.
and they of Barcelona, Anno
Dom. 1434. which lawes
being all collected and amas|sed,
serve the Mediterraneans
unto this day.
But on the great Ocean,
which is our sea, the first
lawes we knew to be made,
were devised by them of

the Iland of Oleron, situate
on the sea coast of France,
beside S. Martin against the
mouth of Charante and the
Marraes, neere to the entry
of Garumna: which are
therefore called La roold' O|leron;
as by which the con|troversies
on the sea coast
of France toward the Oce|an
were ordinarily decided,
in the towne of the said
Ile, called thereupon, Lavile
de droict, or Oleron. As
where the skilled Skippers
in that law did dwell, and
had cognition of all such oc|current
debates and questi|ons.

Now these lawes of Ole|ron,
were afterward transla|ted
into Dutch by them of
Wisby, for the sea use of the
Dutch coast.
And of late, our Kings
of Scotland made divers Acts
in Parliament, concerning
sea-faringVide act. par. lia. Scot..
As also the Kings of Eng|land
have done beforeVide statut. Ang.:
for Edward the third, by a
solemne inquisition of eigh|teene
most famous persons
for skill in sea-faring, assem|bled
at Quinborow from
divers parts, Anno 1375. set
downe certaine articles
concerning the Admiralty

and sea-faring, into old
French: as may be seene in
an old parchment authen|ticke
booke yet extant;
which articles one Thomas
Roucghton of that same, tur|ned
afterward in Latine, and
intituled de officio admiralita|tis
Angliae.
Likewise Fredericke the
second of Denmarke, in his
generall convention, at Cop|penhaven,
Anno 1561: sets
downe a compend of Sta|tutes,
for ruling of his Sea-faring
subjects; but for most
part all one with La rooled' O|leron.
Also the French King

Henry the third, added his
new constitutions to these
of Francois, and others his
predecessors, which are
chiefly for the authorising
of his Admiralty, Iurisdicti|on,
honour and profits ther|of;
preferring the Admirall
and his officers to all other
Iudges and Iustices, except
these called Royals.
Notwithstanding all these
many, divers, and late Sta|tutes
and Ordinances made
and set forth these sixeteene
hundreth yeares, by the na|tions,
people, and Princes
above written, in the deci|sion
of causes, and judging of

sea-faring controversies; that
fragment of the Rhodian
law, extant and Latinized
by Simon Shardius, intituled
by him, Leges navales Rhodi|orum
 selectae Leges Rhodio|rum,
with the interpretations
and commentations, devi|sed
thereupon by the old
Romane Iurisconsults insert
in the Pandects; together
with the constitutions made
by the Romane Emperours,
contained in the Cod. and
Novells at large: as it were
by common consent of Na|tions,
obtaines the preroga|tive
throughout all Europe,
as in Great Brittaine, Ger|many,

France, Italy, and
Spaine. Such is the force and
authority of the Civill Ro|man
Law amongst all Na|tions
Christian.
In which Countries, al|beit
there hath bin, and yet
remaines a great number of
professors and doctors of
the Roman civill law, who
have written largely there|upon;
yet few or none hath
taken in hand to write per|tinently
or expresly, upon
the lawes concerning sea-faring,
the traffique on sea,
and by sea, with the duties
requisite of every sea-faring
person, of all sorts and

degrees.
It is true that Iulius Fer|rettus
in his observant de|voir
to the Emperour Charls
the fift, prepared a discourse
for the addressing of Navies
with convenient and expert
Governours, and all sort of
necessaries for hostility on
the sea, intituled de iure  re
nautica, but farre off from
our present Argument, as
may bee seene by the same
of late published, Anno 1579.
and dedicated to Philip,
Charles his sonne, by Exupe|rantius
Ferrettus, sonne also
to the said Iulius.
Petrus Pekkius also a

Fleming Zelander, hath lear|nedly
commented upon the
titles of the civill law, touch|ing
the sea-lawes; but more
busied about the exposition
of words then of the matter.
Likewise Benvenutus Strac|cha,
in his large booke de
mercatura, interlaceth a lear|ned
title, de nautis, navibus
 navigationibus, but com|meth
not close to this our ar|gument;
for he holds
straightly within the com|passe
of the civill law, pro|testing
also his pretermissi|ons
and remissions of many
chiefe matters to certaine
Doctors, who also writes but

obiter of the sea matters, and
none speakes of the sea cu|stomes,
which is our princi|pall
argument: To the end
of which booke is annexed
an halfe sheet of paper, bea|ring
consilia Roderici Suarij
de usu maris  Navibus
vehendis; a turne of small
contentment.
'Tis true that Simon Shar|dius,
Anno 1561. promised
this same compend and col|lect
of sea lawes forth of all
lawes (which presently by
Gods grace I intend) but by
death prevented, could not
performe it.
To conclude then, since no

man, as I can understand,
hath set his pen to this my
argument and purpose, for
the due information of eve|ry
sort of sea-faring persons
in every order, whether
Commanders, Iudges, Skip|pers,
Mariners, Merchants,
Passengers, Fishers, Ferry|ers,
Watermen, c. concer|ning
their severall duties,
priviledges and powers, and
all manner of things per|taining
or incident to sea
and sea-farers; I thought
good, after the insight and
deepe consideration of all
the lawes and ordinances
aforesaid, to mend a weake

piece of labour, which I in|tended
many yeares since,
intituled the Sea law of Scot|land;
and to frame the same
in a very harmonicall col|lection
of all sea-lawes,
And upon the conscience
of my profession of the ci|vill
law, having no em|ployment
or part in any Ad|miralty,
to publish the same
for the use of the Admiral|ties,
and benefit of all bene|volent
sea-farers; and that
presently, because of the
present use thereof so requi|ring
the same, as I now
cleerly perceive: that is to say;
Because that wheras the most

civill, wise, and politicke na|tions,
have even most care|fully
distinguished the juris|diction
of the sea from the
jurisdiction of the land in all
respects: yet neverthelesse
some men prease alwaies,
upon what intent I wot not,
to confound the same. And
the multitude of these who
doe acknowledge the fore|said
distinction, as specially
the Mariners, through igno|rance
contemne all other
law but the rule of Oleron.
In these respects (I say) I
have with great paine and
travell, concluded the pub|lication
of this work; which

if it please (as I pray) God to
blesse with the owne effect,
I have reward enough.



TIT. I.
The order of this Treatise.
AS the affaires of the
sea concernes onely
sea-faring and med|lers
therewith: even so all
doubts, differences, and con|troversies,
rising upon the
same, and their cases must
also concerne the same
persons, which are eyther
chiefly Owners, Out-tra|ders
or hyrers, Masters,
Pilots, Mariners, Clerkes,

Merchants, Passengers. Of
whom the owner is hee, to
whom the ship or any part
pertaines in property. The
out-trader or hirer, hee to
whom as hirer or partner for
a voyage or more, or a lon|ger
time, during the hyring
and lease of the shippe, the
profits and commodities
thereof redoundsL. 1. de, exer|cit. act..
And the Master is hee to
whom the whole care and
charge of the shippe is com|mitted
L. 1. ad l. Rhod.. The rest are all
knowne. Now their persons
whiles happens all to fall
forth in one man; as one to
be Master, owner, and out|trader;

and againe to be all
divers and distinct: and
therfore the actions to beare
out accordingly. Likewise
the cognition of their de|bates
pertaines not to every
Iudge indifferently, but only
to the Admirall of the sea:
which thing this Abridge|ment
shall orderly and sum|marily
declare; beginning at
the Iudge ordinary to sea-fare
causes, the members of
the Court, and manner of
proceeding there: next, the
persons ordinary in shippes,
with the fraughting thereof,
as belonging to the chiefe
uses of shipping: thirdly, the

power, duty, and priviledge
of every one of the foresaid
in ships: fourthly, the ma|nifold
causes of losses and
dammage in sea-faring, with
the redresse thereof: fiftly,
the priviledged ships, ship|wracke,
shippes and things
taken and found on the sea,
or within the floud-marke
thereof: and lastly, of Fi|shing,
Fishers, Ferryers and
Watermen, and Shippe|wrights.



TIT. II.
Of the Iudge ordinary, in sea-faring
causes, with his jurisdi|ction,
and priviledges.
AS for the Iudge of the
Sea, wee have first to
consider, how at the
beginning of the Roman
Empire, there was a speciall
difference betwixt the per|sons
to whom the charge
of shipping was given,
and them to whom the
commandement of Fleets

and Navies was committed;
and betwixt the persons who
exercised the jurisdiction in
sea-faring debates, as follow|eth.
For amongst the Romans
in the beginning, first the
builders, fortheakers, or fur|nishers,
and preparers of
Ships and Navies with all
necessaries (by a speciall or|dinance
called Lex Decia)
were stiled Duum viri nava|les;
Livius lib. . as the Governours of
these Fleets were called
Archigubernij,L. Seius Satur|ninus ad S. C. trebell. and the
Iusticiaries of sea-faring de|bates,
Magisteriani: even so
amongst the Grecians, the

Commanders of their fleets
were stiled . And after
the Empire seated at Constan|tinople,
Magnus dux classis,
and Drungarius magnus,Vide frag|menta ascripta Polybio.
as the chiefe carrier of the
Pinsell or flagge. His stile
afterward was Admiratus,
from Amiras, a word of
the Sarazens, signifying
an Overseer, or a Cap|taine
on sea or on land;
for Mirar is to see, as the
Spaniard useth it. From this
word Amiras, commeth the
word Amirante to the Ita|lians
for the Leader of their
fleets, as well as L'amirag|lio:
albeit they tearme

their sea-faring Iudges, Li
consoli del mare, and such like
from the same word Admi|rall,
which most part of the
Nations of Europe use in
the same meaning; as first
and chiefly France, where
Childebert the first, one thou|sand
yeeres sithence, in|stituted
an Admirall as Cap|taine
and Commander of
his Armie upon sea, like as
he did then ordaine a Mar|shall
for the governement of
his Gen d'armerie on land.
Onely the Spaniard called
this Leader and Comman|der
of his fleets and navies,
Adelantado: as who should

goe before the rest.
Briefly, the word Admi|rall,
how ever this day it be
used or abused, for to signifie
the chiefe shippe, which was
Navis praetoria to the Ro|mans,
as the chiefe Com|mander
of the fleet; yet that
word Great Admirall, notes
properly the man whom
the Romans called Praefe|ctum
maris, and the Greci|ans,
Thalassiarcham: to wit,
the Governour of the sea.
And thus farre concerning
names and styles for the
Commanders and Guberna|tors
of ships, fleets, and seas.
But concerning the jurisdi|ction

of the sea, and the
exercises of justice amongst
sea-faring men; at first a|mongst
the Romans, it was
allowed to every President
on the coasts, and afterward
other Iudges were specially
constitute at the sea sides,
called Magisteriani:Vide Alberic. ad novell. 17.  24. but
their Iudges were all coun|table
to their higher Iudge,
styled Praefectus praetorio sub|limissimus,
from whom was
no appellatio~ or advocatio~L.  procon|sulibus. C. de appell.
Sithence, in these latter
daies, for the readier obedi|ence
to the great Admirall
of the Sea, it is by common
consent of Nations, suc|cessively

agreed, that in con|sideration
of the Admirals
their soveraine commande|ment,
their speciall prefer|ment,
and power upon the
lives of men within the sea
floud; that therefore they
should also have a soveraine
jurisdiction onely proper
to themselves, over all sea-faring
men within their
bounds, and in all sea-faring
causes and debates, civill
and criminall. So that no o|ther
Iudge of any degree,
at least in Scotland, may
meddle therewith, but one|ly
by way of assistance; and
that by commission and in

difficile causes, as was found
in the action intended by
Antoin de la tour, against one
Christian Marteis, 6 Novem.
Anno 1542.Tm. 1. c. 35 regist. Scot.
In which jurisdiction, the
first power necessary, is to
constitute a Vice-Admirall
and Captaines to supply his
absence on sea; as also Depu|ties,
for particular parts on
the coasts, with the Crow|ners
to view the dead bodies
found on sea, or found on
the coasts thereof, and
Commissioners or Iudges
generall, for exercising
justice in his high Court on
land, with Clerkes, Pro|curers,

Doome-sayers, Mar|shals,
and other Officers, for
the exercising of their
said jurisdiction both in peace
and warre: and therefore
to sit and hold Courts where
they please; to execute ju|stice,
to imprison and re|laxe;
and to command the
Kings prisons and bor|roughs
their prisons, to re|ceive
and keepe their war|ders
and prisoners.L' Admirall de France.
Finally, their authority
should be distinctly acknow|ledged
in all things pertai|ning
to sea-faring.
It is true, that in Scotland
before the erection of our

Admirall after the exam|ple
of other Nations, the
Deanes of Gild were ordi|narily
Iudges in civill de|bates,
betwixt Mariner and
Merchant, as the Water-bai|ly
betwixt Mariner and Ma|riner,
like as the high Iustice
was Iudge in their criminals.
Which actions all now fal|ling
forth betwixt the per|sons
aforesaid, of due apper|taines
to the jurisdiction of
the Admirall; and therefore
his Iudge depute or Commis|sar,
called Iudge Admirall,
and none other, should sit,
cognost, determine and
minister iustice in the foresaid

causes: as likewise upon
all complaints, contracts,
offences, pleas, exchan|ges,
assecurations, debts,
counts, charter-parteis, co|venants,
and all other
writings concerning lading
and unlading of shippes,
fraughts, hyres, money
lent upon casualties and
hazard at sea, and all other
businesses whatsoever a|mongst
sea-farers, done on
sea, this side sea, or beyond
sea; not forgetting the cog|nition
of writs and appeales
from other Iudges, and the
causes and actions of Repre|sals
or Letters of Marque:

yea, to take stipulations, cog|nossians,
and insinuations,
in the bookes of the Admi|raltie:
and to doe all other
things without which the
jurisdiction of the Admiral|tie
cannot stand nor beare
out; and therefore to arrest
and put in execution, to in|quire
within and without
liberties, by the oathes of xij.
men upon all offences.Vide diploma|ta admiralior. in utroque regno. Vide lat de off. Admir. Ang

TIT. III.
Of the Admirall Clerke.
THe Clerke of the Ad|mirall
Court, beside
that he should be ve|ry
skilfull, faithfull, and give
his solemne oath thereupon
at his admission; and beside
the poynts of his office re|quisite
and common to all
Clerkes of other Courts,
hee should have divers
Registers, as for congees,
saueconducts, pasports,

sea-briefes; as without which
no shippe should passe to
the sea in time of warre, not
yet to farre voyages in time
of peace:L' Admirall de France. which no other
Iudges nor Governours
should give forth, but the
Admirall onely.Eodem.
Item, one other Register for
the reports of the Skippers
and Captains, at their return
to the Admirall also.Eodem.
Item, one other Register
for the names of Merchants,
and Passengers, and Ow|ners;
for the Skipper is hol|den
to give-up the said per|sons
by name.Secundum act. parliam. Iac. . cap. 27.
And because no man ought

to take upon him to be a
Master or Pilot without due
tryall of his skill: even so
ought his triall to be regi|stred
in the Admirall his
bookes.L' Admirall de France. But within the
water of Thames, this tryall
and registration of Pilots,

Lastly, all money lent to
hazard upon the sea, called
of old Pecunia trajectitia, for
certaine profit, called Foe|nus
nauticum, for the which
the Lender was wont to
beare the perill, against the
manners of these avarici|ous
daies; their lendings (I say)

and billes of assurance,
should be done before the
Admirall Clerke.L' Admirall de France.
To conclude, no other
Clerke or Writer, may med|dle
or pen things concerning
the sea-faring, without li|cence
of the Admirall.Kintor. art. 45



TIT. IV.
Of the Advocates and other
Officers assistants for the better
and speedier proceeding in
the Admirall Court.
FOr the more upright
proceeding, and easier
dispatch of causes and
plaints in the Admirall
Court, it is found needful that
all Procurers, before they
be heard, sweare solemnly
first, that they should doe
nothing maliciously; but as
soone as they finde their

action to be unrighteous in
any part of the processe, they
shall tell it to their client:
and if the client will insist,
then to shew it to the Iudge.
Secondly, that they shall
not reveale their clients se|cret
to the adversary, nor
yet collude with him to be|tray
their client. And lastly,
that they shall propone
neither dilator nor per|emptor
against their con|science.Il consolato del mare.
To conclude, the oath
of fidelity is likewise to bee
solemnly taken of the rest
of the officers of Court:
for the due execution of

their offices, namely, at
their admissions.Eodem.



TIT. V.
The manner of proceeding in
Sea-faring causes.
THe debates of sea-fa|rers,
and sea-faring
actions, should be de|cided
according to the recei|ved
Lawes and Statutes of
the sea: which fayling, then
the customes and consue|tudes
of these are to be fol|lowed.
Perladepre|catio ad l. Rhod. Bald. in l ob|servan. in sect. antiquam de off. procns. because all disposi|tions
and ordinances com|monly
take their interpreta|tion
from consuetudes and
uses.Innocnt. in e. vlim de erb. Sig.

And if neither law writ|ten,
or unwritten custome,
nor consuetude occurres or
appeares, the last refuge is
to the opinions and senten|ces
of skilled and upright
men in the profession and
exercise of sea-faring; because
it is old and common, that
the judgement of skilled and
well practised men, should
be followed in their owne
trade and calling.Per l. 1. de vent inspic.
But in the manner of pro|ceeding,
it is a perpetuall pri|viledge,
Quod velo le vato.L. de submer|sis C. de nauf. lib. 11.
That is to say briefely and
summarily, causes should be
cognosced, and without

the solemnitie of other ordi|nary
Courts  judgements,
onely looking to God and
the truth; so that the Iudge
should doe, if it were possible,
as God himselfe.Vide rotam genuae,  DD.
Plaints then of sea-farers
should be most summarily
cognosced, but specially of
shipwracke; for it were a
cruelty to vexe so miserable
persons with the tedious
ordinary proceedings of
Courts, in so much as they
need not to put their petition
in writing.artol. Luius  Iohannes ad d. l: de submersis.
And because that sayling
tends to a great Common|wealth,
therefore least sea-farers

should bee wearied
with pleas, and so either lose
their right, or their trade,Secundum l. illum de Pet. hered.
summary processe should be
common to them all.
Which sort of processe is
so urged by the Doctors of
Law, that they counsell
Iudges, who feare appellati|ons
or advocations, to pre|vent
the same by a present
execution;DD. i c. pro|posu . de sor. comp . namely, in
causes of spoyle or wrack: so
that upon every interloquu|tor,
they may proceed to exe|cution,
making restitution
presently. Providing alwaies,
that caution bee first found
by the spoyled, to satisfie

the sentence of the Iudge of
the appellation, in case it
shall happen to be made.L' Admirall de France.
This is also a priviledge
of the sea-faring Iudicature,
that albeit by the common
rules of the law, where no
Litiscontestation is past, no
witnesse should bee received,
nisi ad aeternam rei memoriam,
ac adversario ad id citato;
yet in shipwracke, as a case
very pittifull, any of the
shippe-broken men may
come to the Iudge of that
part where the wrack hap|pens,
and by witnes brought
with him, prove the wracke
and spoile;Si quis. 10. C. de naufrag. to the end

that if any owner should
pursue his goods, for to re|cover
them, hee might be
justly repelled by an excepti|on
of an innocent losse:L. Fin. ad l. Rhod.
which should be done within
a yeer and a day; namely, by
such as were in service to
the Prince and country.L. quoties. de naufrag.
The like is to be observed
also in causes of spoyle;
where by the lawes of Eng|land,
it is sufficient for the
spoyler to prove his goods
by his marke, c.Vide sta|tut. Ang.
In which doing, no citati|on
is required; and that
against the common law:L. de unoqu|que. dere iudica.  L. quoties. C de naufrag. lib. 11.
yea, the death of the ship-broken

may not onely bee
proved by the rest living, but
also by the persons, who
were present at the prepara|tion
of their voyage, even
their owne parents and
children, if none of the ship-broken
be on live.De l. quoties.
And as this is a priviledge
extraordinary for such
chances; even so ordinari|ly
may Merchants and Ma|riners
sayling together, beare
witnesse each one to other
of their society within ship,
if they have neyther to
lose nor gaine thereby; and
namely Mariners, for or
against the Skipper when

the voyage is ended, and
when they are free from
his commandement.Il conselato artic. 221.  222. For
by the consent of the Do|ctors,
when the truth can|not
be otherwise tryed, then
unable persons may be heard.
Item, to the end that this
trade bee not hindred by
calumniators, and wilfull
vexers of their neighbours
under colour of Law: it is
provided, that not onely the
common caution, Iudicio si|sti,
 Iudicatum solvi, bee
kept on the part of the
defender; but also that the
pursuer shall finde caution,
de expensis solvendis, if hee

faile in proofe.Consent of ll sea lawes.
Likewise, in case the par|ty
pursued be contumax, and
will not compeire to defend
himselfe, or his shippe, or
things challenged; namely,
after three or foure citati|ons
directed from the high
Court of the Admiraltie,
called quatuor defaltae (for
that citation called Vnum
pro omnibu, is not sufficient
to convince one of contu|macy)
specially in the claime
or vindication of a shippe,
any part thereof, or any o|ther
such like thing or goods;
then may the Iudge ordaine
his Marshall or officer, by

his sentence called primum
decretum, to put the plain|tiffe
in possession thereof, at
least to the worth of the suit:
Providing notwithstan|ding,
that if the party com|peir
within a yeare and a
day after, offering the ex|pence
made to the pursuer,
and caution to obey the de|finitive,
he shall yet be heard
upon the propriety. Other|wise,
that time being fully
expired, the Iudge may
proceed and adjudge the
propriety of the ship to the
plaintiffe.De offic. Ad|mi. Ang. in fin. cum ibi citatis.
Neither is it needfull to
execute summons or cita|tions

in such cases, else|where
but where the ship or
quarrelled goods in question
lies, or at the part usuall of
their haunting.Ibid.
Further, as this way it is
provided for the snibbing
and staying of calumniators
in iudgement: even so it
is ordained against malici|ousnesse
out of iudgement
of such persons who one|ly
to hinder and stay their
neighbours, vexes them
with needlesse arrestments;
that upon caution such a|restments
be speedily losed,
except it be either for fraught
already deserved, or ma|riners

wages, or such cases
wherein by law the shippe
is obliged; or else for service
to the Prince:Il conselato 4 as also if ar|restment
be used, eyther up|on
goods, or mariner ready
to saile, the same may bee
loosed, upon caution to make
forth-comming so much
goods as the mariner hath
within ship-boord.Denmarke.



TIT. VI.
Of persons ordinary in ships.
TOuching persons or|dinary
for sayling in
ships, they are of di|vers
orders, and therefore
diversly stiled: as first, hee
who beares charge over all
the shippe and kippage, is
commonly called by us, and
most part of nations, both
now and of old, and special|ly
by the Romane lawes,
Navicularius, or Magister

Navis:L. 1.  pas|sim. ad l. rhod.  l. 1. parag naur, caup. that is, as wee
speake, Master of the ship;
by the Dutches, Skipper; 
by the Grecians, Nauarchus
or Nauclerus;Vide l. semper de iur. immun i|ta.  l. 3. C. de navicular. Vide Vegetium de re militar. by the Ita|lians,
Patrono. But if the
ship be a warfaring ship, the
principal person is common|ly
called Captaine by us and
other neere nations. The
next to the Master, is hee
who directs the ship in the
course of her voyage, called
by the French-men, Pilot;
by Vs and the Dutche,
Steirsman; by the Romans,
Gubernator;Vide lege na|vales Rhodior. by the Italians,
Nochiero,Il consolato Pilotto, Nau|archus,
as Gerretus writes.

The third person is com|monly
called the Masters
mate or companion, chiefly
if the Master be Steirsman
himselfe: this man is called
by the Grecians and Ro|mans
Proreta:Vide dd. Il. navales,  Plautum in ruden. his charge
is to command all before the
mast.
The fourth person is hee
who attends upon the
mending of the faulty parts
in the ship, called by us and
the Dutches, Timberman or
Shipwright; by the old Gre|cians
and Romans, Naupe|gus
or Naupagus:Vide dd. Il selec. Rhod. but by
the late Grecians, Calaphates:
for which cause the Emperor

Michael was called Calapha|tes,
because his father had
beene a Shipwright in
Paphlagonia; as witnesseth
Egnatius and Volateranus,Lib. 23
and therefore the Veneti|ans
and Italians name
their Timberman Calafat|te.
Vide il con|sola.
The next person in order,
is hee who beares the
charge of the shippes boat,
called by us Boatsman; by
the Italians, Barchierie;
by the Grecians and Ro|manes,
Carabita: for Carabus
notes the boat of the ship.Vide dd Il. Selec.
The sixt person requisie
in any shippe of great bur|then,

is a Clerke; by the Ita|lians,
Scrivano,Vide il con|sol. whose of|fice
is to write up and make
accompt of all things recei|ved
or delivered in the ship,
together with all the ordina|ry
and needfull expenses
made upon ship  kippage:
who for his more faithfull
discharge, should at his en|try
be sworne before the or|dinary
Sea-Iudge; as is ordi|narily
practised in Ancona,
and other parts of Italy.Ferretus de re  iure navali.
The seventh is the Cook,
a most necessary member as
long as there will be bellies.
The eighth is the ships
boy, who keepes her conti|nually

in harbours; called
therefore by the Grecians,
Nauphylakes; by the Romans,
Dietarius;L. 1. parag 2, naut. caup. and by the Ita|lians,
Guardiano.Il consolato. All the
foresaids are distinct in offi|ces
and names, and there|fore
accordingly should also
be distinguished in hyres and
fees, after the custome of
the Country. The rest of
the persons of the kippage,
are under the common stile
of mariners, which the Ro|mans
call Nautas: but they
name those of the lowest
and base degree, as may
bee the boyes and prenti|ses
in ship, Mesonautae,Vide Budaeum ad l. 1. naut. caup.

and Nautebatae, as who
should bee ready at com|mand,
to climbe upon the
tewes, or to such common
service in the ship.Vide l. debet. parag. haec actio. naut. caup.



TIT. VII.
The fraughting of Ships.
NO Shippe should be
fraughted without a
charter-partie written
and subscribed,Il naval. rhod. select. art. 20. contai|ning
both the Master and
Merchant, and the name of
the Ship, that no doubt may
arise;Vide Bartol. in l que rerum. parag. Si navem. de leg 1. argu|mento l. Labeo de. Supel. ligat. c. and likewise, that
the Master shall finde a suffi|cient
Steirsman, Timberman,
Shipman, and Mariners
convenient, Shippe-tycht,
masts, sayles, tewes, strong

anchors, and boat fit for the
ship, with fire, water, and
salt, on his own expences.Cap 17.  130. art. Iaco. 3. Vide de Il. Rhod.
And this charter partie, a|mong
all the westerne Mer|chants,
and those of the great
Ocean, usually is made to
perorme all things requisite
by the lawes of Oleron.d. art. 20.
And if there be no Wri|ting,
but an Earnest, then
the Merchant, if hee repent
or rew, loseth his Earnest:
but the Skipper, if he repent,
loseth the double of the ear|nest
or arlesArt. 19. Il. naval. Rhod.
If the ship be not ready at
the day appointed in the
charter-party to goe to sea,

the Merchant may not one|ly
free himselfe of her,Per legem item parag. Si in lege l. ca. ex|cept
he hold his peace and
discharge her not (for then
by his silence he appeares to
consent of new) but also shal
or may obtaine all charges,
scathes and interest:Oleron. Ex|cept
the Master shew some
excuse of a notorious neces|sitie,
or of a chance that
could not bee eschewed:
and then hee loseth onely
his fraught, because hee
hath not deserved it.Per l. si, ex conducto,  l. si item fundus,  l. haec distin|ctio  d. l. si in. lege. loca.
But if the fault be in the Mer|chant,
d, l. ex condu|cto. he shall pay the
Skipper and shippes dam|mage,
or according to the

Rhodian law, shall entertain
the kippage and company
tenne dayes; and if then he
stay longer, shall pay the
fraught of all accordingly: navalium.
and further, shall upset all
hurt and damage hapning
by fire, water, or otherwise,
after the time appointed.Art. 29. cod.
It is true, that the Rhodi|ans
charge the Merchant in
this case onely with halfe
fraught,  the Skipper with
the whole fraught if he faile:
albeit that the Romans
inflict the pain of the whole
fraught upon the Mer|chant:
d l. si in lege,  l. ult. ad l. rhod.  d. l. ex conducto. specially, if hee
take forth his goods againe;

for then is the fraught
thought to be deserved.l. ult. loca.
But if the ship in her voy|age
become unable with|out
the Masters fault, or
that the Master or Ship bee
arrested by some Magistrae
in her way, the Master may
either mend his shippe, or
fraught another: but in case
the Merchant agree not ther|unto,
then the Master shall
at least obtaine his fraught,
so farre as he hath deserved
it.Oleron,  l. ult. adc. Rhod.
For otherwise, except the
Merchant consent, or
necessitie constrain the Skip|per,
to put the goods in

another ship worse than his
owne, the Master is holden
for all losses and damage, ex|cept
that both the ships pe|rish
that voyage, and that
no fault nor fraud be found
with the Master.d. l ult. Also it
is recounted for a fault, if
the Master put forth the ship
to sea, either without a skilful
Pilot, or without sufficient
furniture  necessaries, ac|cording
to the clause ordina|ry
f charter parties, or that
the other ship in which the
goods were last put in, be
not sufficient, or that the
Master hazard forth to
sea in an unlikely time.d. l. item.

Yea, in former times it was
forbidden expresly, as by the
Emperours Gratian, Theodo|sius,
and Valentinian, to ha|zard
upon sea from Novem|ber

his ship for a certain charge,
and then takes in any more,
he ought to lose his fraught
justly.la rol Oleron.
And in such a case, when
goods bee cast through

good by any contribution,
but by the Skipper his owne
purse.art. 2 lg. naval. rhod. And if hee over|burden
the ship above the
birth marke, he shall pay a
fine.Denmarke.
Item, if a Ship Port at a|ny
other Port then she was
fraughted to, against the
Masters will, as by storm, or
some force; then the goods
shall be transpored to the
port conditioned, on the
Skippers charges: but this
thing also must be tried by
 oath of the Skipper and
two of his Mariners:Oleron. or
else the Skipper may bee in

further danger.
Where also it is to be ob|served,
that for the in-going
to sundry divers ports by the
way, imports not a diversi|tie
or a multiplication of
voyagesDD. in l. qu romae parag. Callimachus. de verb oblig.
But if any man compell
the Skipper to overburden
ship or boat, he may be ther|fore
accused criminally, and
pay the damage happening
thereby.l. unica C. ne quid onr pub. lib. 1.
Item, if any Skipper set his
ship to an unfree man, and
not of substance, and other
qualities prescribed by king
Iames the third,c. 17 c.  act. r. Iac. . hee and
his Mariners shall under-lie

the paines contained therein.
Item, if a Merchant put
in more goods in ship than
was conditioned, then may
the Skipper take what
fraught he please.Il consolato del mae.
It is imputed for a fault to
the Master, if he direct his
course by waies either dan|gerous
through Pirats, ene|mies,
or other evill aven|tures,
and holds not forth
his due rout,l. pe. parag. si navis. loc.  l. si pecuniam. de cond. indeb.  l. qui fiscalis C. de navicul. lib. 11.  l. quum pro|ponas de naut. oen. and dam|mage

It is likewise counted a
fault, if the Master carry the
pensell or flagge of other
Nations than his owne, and
thereby incurres scath and

losse of any thing.Per. l. quum proponas. ad l. rhod. For, as
packquets, pipes, hogsheads,

TIT. VIII.
Of the Master of the Ship, his
power, and duty thereunto
belonging.
THe Master of the ship
is hee to whom the
whole power and
charge of the ship is com|mitted:
l. 1. de exer|cit. act. which power is
prescribed, partly by the
owner or outreader, and
partly by the common law
of the sea: as, to set her forth
for fraught; to take in pas|sengers;
to mend and furnish

the ship.d. l. 1 And to that ef|fect,
if need be, in a strange
countrey to borrow money
with advise of the kippage
or, company,Oleron. upon some
of the tackle, or to sell some
of the Merchants goods;
provided, that the highest
price that the rest of the
goods is sold for at the mar|ket,
be repayed to the Mer|chant:
which being done,
the fraught of that goods so
sold and repayed, shall be re|payed
by the Master to the
owner of the ship, as well as
the fraught of the rest of the
Merchants goods, except the
ship perish in the voyage;

in which case onely the price
that the sold goods were
bought for, shall be rende|red:
Eod. And for no other
cause, no not in the chance
of shipwracke, may the
Master take on or conquest
money, specially, by-selling
of Merchants goods.Eod. And
thus far co~cerning his power
As for the Masters duty, he
ought first before he loose
or make saile, to seeke and
obtaine the consent of the
most part of the kippage or
company; yea, if hee be not
very skilfull, he should doe
no other thing of impor|tance
without their advise:

otherwise, hee shall under|goe
what-ever dammage
happens by his doings;Eod. and
specially if he loose forth of
any harbour without an ex|pert

And as the Skipper his
rashnesse and unskilfulnesse
is thus-wise corrected: even
so his negligence and sloth
is to be punished. As first, by
suffering the overlap and
cowbridge to be unticht,Denmarke.

from water and spoy|ling.Eod. art. 38. Otherwise, the neg|ligent
Skipper is holden to
make good all scath or dam|mage
comming thereby, be|side
that the fraught of such
spoiled goods is lost; except
thatArt. 44. eod. the ship or crear
was open from the begin|ning,

kindes of ships, are tearmed

Further, this duty is requi|red
of the Master, that ac|cording
to the Act made by

King Iames the third of Scot|land,
he give up the names of
all persons transported in his
ship, before he make saile:c 27 actor. per lac 3  l' Ad|miral de France.

for three yeeres
space; but by the custome of

in the meane time, the bed|ding
with the pertinents
thereof, may be of due taken
by the Master and his mate,
to their uses; as also such
cloathing, and other thing
then presently upon that
persons body, may be deli|vered
to the boatsman and
servants of the ship, as who
ought therefore to burie, or
cure at least, the over-putting
of the dead in the Sea.Eod.



TIT. IX.
Of the Masters duty to the
Merchant and Passenger; and
of his priviledges.
THe Master ought to
render againe what|ever
he receives with|in
his ship, to him who deli|vered
the same, as well vi|ctuall
as clothing and mer|chandise,
goods, or other thing:T. T. nau, caup. where we take goods
to be delivered, if either it be
put in the ship, or in pre|sence

of the Master or Clerk
as his deputie, layd to the
ships side,l. 1. in fin. eodem. and both
wayes, the perill to appertain
to the Master.l. 3. eod.
Which thing also is ex|tended
to boatsmen, and to
the Ferryers:d. l. 1. parag.  and yet is it
surest to deliver goods before
witnesse, and that either to
the Master, Clerke, or Skip|per
his deputies thereto:Art. 12 ll. navalium.
for the master is not holden
for such things as are put in
ship without his, and his
companies knowledge;l. 1. depositi.
because where men are
found ignorant, they are al|so
esteemed not to consent.

But if the Merchant or Pas|senger
keepe his goods by
himselfe, as money or such
thing in his coffers, and then
alledge the lacke therof, then
is the Skipper and his kip|page
onely to purge them|selves
by their oath:Eod. art. 13. but if
afterward notwithstanding
they be found guilty, the de|nyer
shall pay the double,
and also be punished for
perjurie.Art. 14. eod.
Even so, the Master is ly|able
for all damage su|stained
through evill hooks,
cordels, blocks or lines;
namely, if the mariner fore|shew
the said things to be

faulty: and alwaies the mari|ners
shall help the Skipper in
common to pay the said
damage.Oleron.
Item, if any scath or dam|age
happen to the Merchant
or Passengers goods, through
unreasonable stowing or
breaking up, the master shall
not onely refound or make
good the same, but also lose
his fraught, and twenty
pound in Scotland to the
King,Eod. c. 17. c. 130. act. Iacob. 3. or his Admirall as
his successor now; and for
lacke of proofe in this case,
the Skipper and his kippage
shal be put to their oath.Oleron.
Further, what ever shal hape~

through fault, negligence or
chance eschewable, or by
the deed of passengers and
others than himselfe or his
kippage, the Skipper is hol|den
to answer and pay for
all, to the uttermost pen|ny:
d. l. 1. in fin.  l si vendita de perie. rei. vend.  l. 5.  6. naut. caup. for if such dammage
happen by a mariner, the
Skipper shall refound the

it from the mariner.d. l. 7.
But it is not so if the damage
bee done by a mariner to
another, except he be a
Merchant also, or by a
Merchant or Passenger to
one another, then shall not
the double be sought of the

master.Vide d. l. 7  l. unic. furt. ad naut. caup. Neither yet is the
master holden for anything
without the ship, or yet with|in
the same, if he duely fore|warn
each man to keepe his
owne goods, and they agree
thereunto.l. fin. naut. caup.  per l. itaque de ed. edict.
Such is the force of due
protestation, according to
the opinions of the most fa|mous
Doctors;Bartol.  Ia|son in l. non solum parag. mortem. de nou oper. nunc. which co~|ditions
aforesaid, are most
justly layd upon the master,
because he ought to hire
good men, and no evill per|son
in his company:Instit. de ob. qu ex delict. parag fin. for it
is in his owne free will to
chuse his company, and he
should not be ignorant of

the men he hath to doe
with;l. quicu alio. de rog. iur. otherwise, if the ma|ster
were not so obliged to
all such duties and diligence
for the Merchant  Passen|ger,
there should be great
occasion of stealth  spoile.l. 1. in fin. naut. caup.
Lastly, if through the Ma|sters
fault, confiscation, or
other damage happes, as for
non-payment of the custom,
or false bils of the goods cu|stomable,
or for transporting
of unlawfull goods, the Ma|ster
shall refound the same
with the interest.Seund. fin. l. ult. ad l. Rhod.  l. quum proponas C. de naut. s|nor.
But concerning the pur|suits
of these aforesaids, as
the Merchant may wel pur|sue

for the spoyled goods
onely:Accursius in l. 5. naut. caup. per l. mela ad l. aq. even so may the
Master pursue the stollen
goods; as he who must one|ly,
at least, chiefly, answer
therefore.Per. l itaque de furtis. And yet for all
this, in case for want of these
things, which the Merchant
at the fraughting promised
to be done at the entry to the
voyage, any of the aforesaid
losses happens, and there|with
the Master and foure
mariners sweare no fault to
have been in them, the Ma|ster
shall goe free.La reol d' O|leron.
And yet must we not over|passe
this observation, that
if the Master offer the just

custom, anchorage, or what|ever
other duty pertaines to
any Customers, and he, be|cause
of their unrighteous
refusall, makes saile, the wea|ther
and his necessity so re|quiring,
then may he be just|ly
defended afterward a|gainst
that Customer.Per l. quantae: de pu.
Neither yet should a ship
that hath once paid her an|chorages,
pay againe, if she
be forc't through tempest

TIT. X.
The Masters duty to the
Mariner.
SEeing the Master is the
ordinary ruler over his
owne kippage or com|pany,
he ought to keepe
them in peace so long as they
eate his bread.Oleron. And if a|ny
mariner hap to be hurt
in doing service, or by his
companion, the Master shall
cause him to be healed,
as he who is onely answe|rable
for the fact of all with|in
ship-boord;Per. l. 1. de exerc. act.  l. fin. naut. caup. and then by

his authority, repeit or reco|ver
from the other mariner,
the charges, with all that is
lost to the hurt man therby:Art. 5. ll. na|ual.
except that he who is hurt
or lamed, have provoked
the other by evident invasi|on,
assault, or stroaks.Art. 6. eod.
And if a mariner become
sick, the Skipper shall cause
him to be layd in a house,
with all sustentation necessa|ry
and usuall in the ship, but
shall not stay the ship untill
he be healed; and when he
recovers health, shall give
him his hire: or if he dye,
shall give it to the wife or
nearest friends.Per. l. ulr. ad l. Rhod. But if a

mariner be not hurt in the
ships service, the Skipper
shall hire another in his
place; who if he draw more
hyre, then that mariner shall
refound the superplus.Oleron. And
alwaies the Master ought to
le~d his mariners if they lackEod.
Item, if through the Ma|sters
fault, the ships boat pe|rish
with any mariners in it,
as through spoyld tews, c.
then shal the Master pay one
whole yeeres hyre to the
heires of the drowned:Art 46. il. naval.
Item, he ought to give his
mariners, flesh upon Son|day,
Tuesday, and Thurs|day;
and upon other dayes,

fish, or such like, with suffici|ent
drinke: but no meate to
them that sleepe not in the
ship.ll consolato. And yet the quality
and quantity of mariners
food and hyres, goeth di|versly,
according to the di|vers
customes of Countries,
and the conditions made at
the entry to their voyage.



TIT. XI.
Of the duties and priviledges
of Mariners.
MAriners owe all due
obedience to the Ma|ster,
not onely in fly|ing
from him in his wrath
so farre as they can, but also
in suffering; yet may they af|ter
one stroake defend them|selves.
In case of rebellion
of mariners against their
master, which is thought
then to be done, when the

Master hath thrise lifted the
Towell from before any
mariner, and yet he sub|mits
not himselfe, then may
he not onely be commanded
forth of the ship at the first
land, but also if he make o|pen
strife and debate against
the master, hee shall lose his
halfe hire, with all the goods
he hath within ship-boord.Oleron,  il consolato.
But if in this strife a ma|riner
useth any armour or
weapons, then should the
rest of the mariners binde
him, prison him, and pre|sent
him to justice; so that if
any of them refuse to lay to
his hand, and to assist, he

shall lose his hire, with all
that he hath within shippe-boord.
Il consolato. cap. 160. Yea in case any
number of the mariners
would conspire to force the
Skipper to passe to any other
Port, than to the which he
was fraughted, then may
they be accused criminally,
and punished, as for a capi|tall
crime.Denmarke.
And yet, if a rebellious
mariner repent in time, and
offer amends for a simple re|bellion,
and the Skipper not|withstanding
refuse; he may
follow the ship, and obtain
his hire.Oleron.
Mariners ought each one to

helpe and assist others on the
sea: or else he that refuseth,
loseth his hire; and the oath
of his fellowes shall be a
proofe against him.Eodem.
Mariners in a strange
Port, should not leave the
ship without the masters li|cence,
or fastning her with
foure ewes; or else the losse
lights upon them. They
should also await upon the
ship untill she be discharged,
and ballasted new,Denmark. Oleron. and
the tackle taken downe.
And if a mariner, in time
of loosing and lading, labour
not with the rest of the com|pany,
but goes idle and ab|sents

himselfe, he shall pay a
fine to the rest, prorata, at
the Masters discretion.Denmark.
At least, the halfe of the
kippage or company, ought
in strange country port or
roade to stay aboord: and
the rest who goe a-land, al|beit
with licence, should
keepe sobriety, and abstaine
from suspected places, or
else should be punished in
body and purse, like as bee
who absents himselfe when
the ship is ready to saile.Denmark.
Yea, if he give out himselfe
for worthier than he is in
his calling, he shall lose his
hire, halfe to the Admirall,

and the other half to the ma|ster:
Eodem. but this especially
ought to be executed against
an unworthy Pilot.Eodem. The
mariner also forfets his hire
if the ship breake in any part,
 he help not with al his di|ligence
to save the goods.Oleron.
If it chance any otherwise
than well to the Master, the
mariners are then holden to
bring backe the ship to the
port from whence she was
fraughted, without delay,Eodem.
except it be otherwise provi|ded.
A mariner may carry as
much meat forth of the ship
as he may eate at a meale, but
no drink.Eodem.

A mariner may either keep
his portage in his own hand,
or put forth the same for
fraught: and yet should not
the ship stay upon the prepa|ration
for his portage.Eodem. So
that in case the ship be fully
laden before the goods for
his portage be brought in, he
shall have the just fraught of
so much goods.Il consolato.
If a ship passe further than
the mariner was hired, his
hire should be accordingly
augmented; except he be
hired, as the French man
speakes, a mareages, mais
non  deniers.Oleron. If
a Mariner runne away

with his hire undeserved, he
deserves the gallowes.Denmark,  Oleron.
If a mariner be hired for a
simple mariner, and after|ward
in the voyage findes
hiring tobe a Pilot or a Ma|ster,
he may passe with pro|vision
to render his former
hire: eve~ so is it if he mary.Eodem.
Mariners are not onely
holden to loose and deliver
goods over-boord; but also
if no Porters nor Caryers be
in those parts, to carry the
same themselves, for such
hire as other workmen
should have had therfore.Il consolato del mae.
If it happen a ship to be
prized for debt or other|wise

to be forfeited, yet
should the mariners hire be
paid; and if she prosper, to
receive their pay in the same
money that the fraught is
paid with.Eodem.
Lastly, a mariner should
neither be arrested nor taken
forth of a ship making to
saile, for any debt (but onely
his hire, and as much other
goods as he hath in the ship
arrested therefore, according
to the quantitie of the debt,
and the master to be an|swerable
for all:Oleron. Den|marke. Kinror. because
the ship is compared to a
mans dwelling house;Bald. in l. cer|ti iuris. loc. and

dwelling house is his most
sure refuge)l. nemo. de reg. iur.  l. plerunque. de in ius voc. except for a
sworne debt, or a penalty to
the King through some
crime.



TIT. XII.
Of the Clerke of the ship.
IN ships of great bulk and
burden, a Clerke is most
needfull: who being put
in by men of chiefe power,
and sworne solemnly before
some Iudge, as the use is in
Italie (or at least before ow|ners
and mariners) that he
shall write nothing but the
truth, nor leave ought un|written;
being, I say, so
constitute, neither Mer|chant
nor mariner may

put in or take out any thing
of the ship without his
knowledge. So that whatso|ever
goods or other thing
shall happen through storme
or otherwise, to be cast, stol|len,
or spoyled, that hath
not beene presented or
shewne to the Clerke, it shall
no way be upset by contri|bution,
or any search made
therefore. And if it come
safe to land, the Skipper may
take what fraught he likes
therefore. Also the Clerke
may take of that which is
delivered to him, and sell
thereof for the ships need,
but must satisfie the owner

thereof: for he must be al|waies
countable of his re|ceits:
Il consolato. But howsoever he
doe, he may neither take in,
nor give forth goods by
night, but in day light.L' Admirall de France.
Vide statuta Ang.



TIT. XIII.
Of a Pilot or Steirsman.
IF a Master hire a Steirs|man
not only for to guide
his ship in through shalds
or other dangers at a time
onely, but also for a whole
voyage, and to be ready
therefore against a certaine
day, and he faile to keepe
that day, he shall not onely
pay Master and Merchants
damage or stay, but also the
fraught that is lost thereby:
except sicknes, or some very

lawfull excuse qualifie it.Oleron,  arg bult. ad l. rhod.
A Steirsman, after the time
he hath brought the shippe
in sure harbour, is no further
bound or liable; for then
should the Master see to her
bed and her lying, and beare
all the rest of the burden,
charge, and danger: so that if
before she come into the
Port or some safety, eyther
she or goods perish or be
spo led, the Pilot makes good
the same: yea, if his faul or
ignorance be so grosse, that
the company sees any mani|fest
and present wracke to all
thereby, then may they leade
him to the hatches and

strike off his head.Oleron  il consolat. Yea,
if without any seeing dan|ger,
certaine of the skilfull'st
mariners deeme that he is
not so skilfull as he set him|selfe
forth to be, then shall
he both lose his hire, and
double the same to the Ad|mirall
and Master, or else
passe thrise under the ships
keil.Denmark.



TIT. XIV.
Of money lent to Sea, called
Nauticum foenus.
GReat is the difference,
or at least should be
betwixt money lent
amongst men, to use on land,
and that money which is
lent to Sea; for this money
is called pecunia Traiectitia,
because that upon the ha|zard
of the lender it is carri|ed
over Sea. So that if the
shippe perish, or that all b
spoiled, the money loses to

the lender.L. r. de foen. naut. But on the
contrary, money on land is
delivered on the perill of the
borrower: so that the pro|fit
of this, is the price of the
onely simple loane; there|fore
generally called usura:
but the profit of the other
loane is called usura mariti|ma,
or soenus nauticum,
which is not the price of
the loane, but of the hazard
and danger which the lender
takes upon him during the
loane:L. periculi. eod. which is under|stood
to be to a certaine day
or voyage, or what-ever of
time agreed upon. And
therefore if the money mis|carry,

eyther before the voy|age
begun, or after the
tearme appointed for the
fll loane; then the perill
pertaines to the borrower
thereof, and not to the len|der:
Vide passim ad. ll. de foen. naut.  ad. ll. naval. Rhod. I meane of perils pro|ceeding
from stormes, vio|lence,
spoyle or such like oc|casions,
which cannot be es|chued
by any diligence of
the borrower; and therefore
in case the borrower im|ploy
the lent money upon
lawfull goods, or that by
his defrauding of the due
customes, the same be con|filcat,
the lender is freed of
such hazards.Vide l. 3. C. de foen. naut. It is also

to be noted, that mony lent
upon the Sea, without ha|zard,
and yet with security,
should pay no profit, suppose
it were unbooked in the
Clerks book with the profit;
contrary to that which is lent
on land:Art. 15.  16 Leg. naval. so that albeit
money be lent within the
ship during the voyage, to the
need of the company; and if
before the day appointed for
the rendring, shipwracke or
spoyle happen, then should
the losse come in contributi|on
betweene them;Art. 17. eod. be|cause
if that money had been
lying by the lender, still un|lent,
it had bin in common

danger of shipwrack of spoil
with the rest. But if the time
appointed were past with
the hazards aforesaid, then
shall the borrower repay the
borrowed money, free from
all contribution.d. art. 17.
Further, in case the bor|rower
deteines any such lent
mony as is aforesaid, beyond
the terme appointed for the
repaying, he shall at his re|turne
not onely pay the pro|fit
agreed upon before the
voyage, but also augment the
same according to the greater
time, and yet shal not pay the
profit of that first condition,
but onely after the common
rate.Art. 18. eod.



TIT. XV.
Of the Outreaders, or Outrig|gers,
Furnishers, Hyrers, and
of the Owners of Ships, and
of actions for and against
them.
IT is not onely permitted
to him who contracts
with the Master of a ship,
or that hath any other acti|on
or claime against him as
Master of the ship, to pur|sue
him; but also the out|reader,
setter, or exercitor
thereof, as him who placed
the Master; and therefore

ought to make good the
Masters deed and fact.Parag. exerci|tor. iust. de ob. ex quasi delic. T. T. naut. coup.
This outreader we take to
be him to whom the com|modity
of the shipeod. ibid. re|dounds;
so that he may lay
his action upon any of them;
Ne in plures adversarios distra|hatur
qui cum uno tantum con|traxit.
d. l. 1. 2.  3. eod.
But the rest of the owners
or outreaders shal relieve this
man prorata of their portio~s;
except the handling of the
ship be so severally divided a|mongst
them: or that the
Master have not his po|wer
and commission of
them all:l. 4 in prin. eod. or that the master

have obliged himselfe be|yond
his commission; as if
he have taken on money to
mend the ship, when as she
needs it not: or that he have
no commission at all; in
which case the lender hath
to blame his owne folly:
for by the common rule of
Law, men should know
well the persons and their
conditions, with whom
they have to bargaine.d. l. 1.  l. qui cum ali de reg. iur.
And yet in case evident
need be of mending, and
money be lent thereto;
suppose the Master should
spend it otherwise, yet ought
the outreader to satisfie

the creditor.l. ult de exer. act. But above
all, that money which is
lent for victuals to the ships
company, should be repay|ed,
as preferd before all o|ther
sort of debts.Per l. inter|dum. cum seq. Qui ptior in pig. But
a Merchant contracting
with a Mariner that is not
a Master, shall have no a|ction
against the outreader,
except for a fault done by
the Mariner, specially, if he
hath beene hyred and put in
by the outreader.
Againe, albeit by the com|mon
law of the Sea the out|readers
may not pursue
persons obliged to the Skip|per,
yet are they permitted to

pursue upon the Masters
contract, as they had bin
contracters principall;Passim. d. l. 1. be|cause
in such dealings he su|staines
the outaders person:
and because of the great
common-wealth that is Pro|cured
by this kinde of traf|fique,
d. l. 1. parag. 10. worthily such pri|viledges
to the outreaders
and exercers of shipping
are granted. And yet is not
the Master alwaies bound to
satisfie all counts to the out|readers:
specially, in case it
happen some passengers to
be Non solvendo, the Master
is nor holden to pay for
them, because it becomes

not the Master, in the accep|tation
of Passengers, to
search out so narrowly their
meanes and ability.l. 2. sect. 6.  l. Rhod.
And againe, the outrea|der
is not holden alwayes to
answer for the Masters
sloath, but for his owne
selfe.Oleron.



TIT. XVI.
Of sundry Partners of Ships,
and their discords.
MOreover, concerning
the owners of the
ship, in case they can|not
agree amongst them|selves
to remaine in Partner|ship;
seeing by the law they
cannot be constrained there|unto:
l. fin. C. proso|cio.  pass. inst.  D. eod. yea, not albeit a
Paction had bin made never
to sunder;L. in hoc pa|rag. si conveniat. pro soc. then is there
many considerations requi|red
in their sundring. And

first, if their common Ship
or Cray be put in building;
or that she be but presently
bought: in these cases it is
thought convenient, that she
shall be imployed one voy|age
first, upon the common
outread and hazard, before
any of these Partners be
heard to sunder  discharge
their part. And after that, if
they cannot agree, he who
desires to be free, should of|fer
to the rest, and set his
part on such a price, as hee
will eyther hold or sell, which
if he will not doe, and yet
refuses to outread with the
rest, then may the rest rigge

forth the ship at their owne
charges, and also upon the
hazard of the wilfull refuser,
so farre as his part extends,
without any count to him of
any deale or part of profit at
her returne:Denmark. cum ll. hic seq. but they
must bee bound to him
to bring her home safe, or
the value of his part.
And justly; because that,
as shippes were invened
in common, for the use of
all men; even of them
that dwell in the moun|taines,
as on the coasts of
the sea:l. arboribus parag. naves de usufr. so were they
ordained and builded for
sayling, and not to lye idle

and unoccupied.Glossa in l. si navis.  iuris. in l. uti para. culp de ri|undic.  l. ar|borib. parag na|vi. de usufruct. But if
the persons, who have most
part of the ship, refuse to a|bide
in partnership with
him who hath a small
part, that neither hee can
sell his part at that price,
without great losse, nor
yet is able for povertie to at|taine
to their parts, then are
they all bound to put the
ship to an appraisement.consolato.
Otherwise, the scoffe which
Casselius, a Romane law|yer,
used against two wilful
partners of a ship, may also
be used against such: that is
to say, while they asked
him by what way they might

divide and part their ship,
Casselius answerd; If ye di|vide
her, then neither of you
shall have her.Maerobius lib. 2. c. 6.
And if for lacke and want
of buyers in that place, the
poore partner can neither es|chew
the oppression of the
richer, nor yet the rich satis|fie
the poor man, perchance
also wilfull; then may the
Iudge ordinary deale and
decree in this case, as he may
In omnibus alijs bonae fidei acti|onibus:
that is to say, consi|der

TIT. XVII.
Of Casting of goods in a voyage,
and the like; and of Contribu|tion
to be made there|fore.
COncerning contribu|tion
or scott and lot, as
we speake, it is ordi|nary:
and first, it is practised
upon shippes so stormestead
that for reliefe of lives and
goods, casting of goods must
be made: In that case the
master shall consult with
the mariners: who if they

consent not,  yet the storm
and danger continue, then
may the master cast some
goods notwithstanding:Oleron.
But if the mercha~t be present,
let him begin to cast,Il consolato. next
the mariners: but if the mari|ner
keep back any part that
should be cast, to his own use,
he shal render the double.Art 3. Il ma|val. select.
But when afterward the
master shall come to land, he
must with the most part of
his company sweare that
he did cast goods for no o|ther
cause but for the safe|ty
of shippe, goods, and
livesOleron. Secondly, when
goods are cast, they shall be

upset and compensed by a
contribution of Ship and
such goods as are safe there|by:
l. 1.  2. ad l. rhod. and not onely of
goods paying fraught and
burdensome, but of cloath|ing,
money, jewels, and such
like,d. l. 2.  oleron which are not weigh|ty.
For, it is most righteous,
that the losse be common to
all things which are safe
thereby.eod. Except things
borne upon a mans body,
victuals and such like, put in
ship to be spended, and ther|fore
should not scott and
lott, with other goods: in so
much, that when they be|come

scant and wanting,
each man is bound to com|municate
the same one to o|ther.
d. l. 2.
But here it may be asked,
whether yet should all kinde
of cast goods, be up-set and
made good by contributi|on,
as for example, the goods
transported above the over|lap,
and goods forbidden to
be transportedl. 17. c. 130 actor. Iacob. 3. Sure, if such
goods happen to be the cause
of any scathe and danger, the
master who received the
same within his ship, shall
beare the losse and also be
criminally pursued there|fore.
Arg. l Vnie. C. ne quid oner. public.

But if goods unadvisedly,
without consent of the ow|ner
thereof, be cast out, on
the sudden; then may he
himselfe upon his conscience
esteeme his owne goods to
the just worth, because the
company hath that way by
their rash dealing, lost the
priviledge they had to esti|mate
that goods.Per. l. si fide. iussor. D. qui satisd. cog.
In like manner the ship
geare and apparell wracked
by storme, imports no more
contribution, then if a work|man
breake or spoyle his
work-tooles, or instruments
in his ordinary work,d. l. 2  l. navis eod.
except in the avoyding of a

danger, as the helving the
maste over-boord,l. amissae. e|od.  Oleron. or the
slipping of a Tow-anchor or
boate upon just fea, or at
the desire of the Mer|chats.d. l. 1.  il consol. del. mar. But that should
be alwayes proved by the
oaths of the ship-men: for
concerning all facts within
house or ship, credit must be
given to the domesticks and
company familiar.Per. l. conse|su. C. de repud:  l. quties. C. de naufrag. c. veniens. extr. de testib. c. 2. de pr|bat. Also
if goods be put in without
the master and clerks know|ledge;
if they be cast, they
shall have no contribution.Il consolato del mar.



TIT. 18.
Of contribution for Pirates.
IF ship or goods be redee|med
from a Pirate, con|tribution
shall be made
therefore, by all; because the
redemption is made for the
safety of all. But if the Pirate
be once Master of all, and yet
take but some speciall goods,
whether from ship or Mer|chant,
and not as a conten|tation
for the sparing of the
rest, it should appeare in this

case, that seeing the remnant
is not safe hereby, but freely
spared, that no contribution
should be made for the taken
goods. For oftentimes Pirats
take but things at their plea|sure,
and not of minde to
spoyle.Vide lat. l. 2. ad l. rhod. Yet now adayes
because this chance of taking
at pleasure, concernes (in
common judgement) the rest
of the goods as subject to
that same pleasure of the Pi|rat;
therefore should it be al|so
in common upset by all to
whom that chance is com|mon.



TIT. XIX.
Of contribution for spoyled and
spilt goods.
IF through the losing of
any cast goods, or upon
any needfull occasion, the
remaining goods be spoyled
either with wet, or other|wayes;
a contribution shall
be made, proportionable for
so much as they are made
worse.Vide l. navis 4. ad. l. rhod.



TIT. XX.
Of contribution for lightning
and disburdening of ships for
their easier entry to the Port,
and for other chances.
IF it be needfull to lighten
a ship of her burden, for
her easier entry to Port
or channell, the two parts
of the losse fall upon the
goods, and the third part
on the ship; except that the
shippe surpasse in worth
the loading, or that the
charge of goods bee not

the cause of her inability to
enter, but some bad quality
proceeding of the ship it
selfe:Oleron. Or that otherwayes
it be provided in the charter-partie,
that the goods shall be
fully delivered at the Port
covenanted and appointed;
for then condition makes
law:L. 1. verse quod convenit. depos. In which case it is to
be also observed, that if by
occasion of lightning, the
goods which are put in the
boat or Lighter, perish, the
ship and remaining goods
in ship shall upset the same.
But on the contrary, if the
ship and remaining goods
perish after the Lighter is

once safe, no contribution
shall be set upon the goods in
the Lighter: because the rule
is constant, that onely then
should goods be liable to
contributions, when ship and
goods come safe to Port.d. l. navis.  l. amissae ad l. rhod.
Item, contribution should
be for the Pilots fee, that is
taken in to guide her into an
unknowne Port;Oleron. as also
to raise the Ship off ground
when the fault is not in the
Master.Eod.
Even so if two ships rush
and crosse one over another,
and the company sweare
their innocencie, as that it
lay not in their power to stay

the same, contribution must
be made for one equall up|set
of both their losses.eod.  l. quem|admodum. pa|rag. si navis ad. l. Aquil.
But not so if one of them pe|rish;
because of that mishap,
there can be no due propor|tion
of the losse: for if it were
otherwise, a malitious Skip|per,
might of purpose set an
old weake ship against a
strong ship, in hope of some
upset and recompence. And
yet for redresse of the lost
shippe, an action may be to
the owner, against the neg|ligent
Master, or the Ma|riner
who losed her, or cut
her cable:d. l. quemad|modum. parag. si navis ad. l. Aquil which action
is called Legis Aquiliae, for

dammage and scathe done.
And therefore if such a
chance befall in the day
light, by a ship under saile a|gainst
a ship riding at anchor,
then the Master of that sai|ling
ship, shall make good
the dammage or scathe of
the other, to the extremity:
and the like shall be done, if
in the night the riding ship
hold fire and light forth, or
make any crying to fore|warn
the other.
It also pertaines to this ar|gument,Art. 3. 6. 11 naval. rhod.
if some sort of
goods, as salt, or corne, be
laid on heap by divers part|ners,
into a shippe without

distinction, and that the Ma|ster
deliver to any of them
their due measure, and before
the rest receive their mea|sures,
the remaining salt or
corne, washes or looses, he
that had the good luck to be
first served, enjoyes it fully
without any contribution to
the rest of the partners:(i)
because when this goods
was put into the ship, it was
delivered to the master, tan|quam
in creditum; and so he is
become owner, as of lent
money: which men are not
holden to render in the selfe
same pieces, but in value or
such like coyne;Iust. in pr. qub. mod. re contrab. ob. e. l. 2. si cert. peti. exceptquod convenit de verb. ob.

there be some other conditi|on
past before: which in all
affaires maketh law. Neither
can this be imputed for any
fault to the master, because
of necessity he behooveth to
make delivery to one, first,
before another.Vidd. l. in menave.



TIT. XXI.
Of the common manner of con|tribution,
and execution
thereof.
IN setting of contribution
or rates, things must be
estimate in manner fol|lowing.
First, the goods cast, spoi|led,
or reft; to the price they
cost, if their chances did hap|pen
before midde voyage:
but if after the midde voy|age,
then to the price, the
rest of the same goods at|taine

to at the market; be|cause
there is here a conside|ration,
rather of losse and
scathe than of any gaine.l. 2. in fin. ad l. rhod.  il consolato.
And because domage and
losse should be drawne as it
were in streite, and gaine
and vantage spredde forth
and extend, according to
Harmenopolus sentence; spoy|led
and lost goods should
bee set to the common
worth, and not after mens
affections:d. l. navis  l. pretia. ubi bartol. ut ad. l. 7. C. de prog. militr. lib. 12. except one|ly
in goods unadvisedly
cast: wherein for the cor|rection
of the rashnesse of
the casters (as who thereby
appeare to have amitted

their owne priuiledge) the
estimation of the goods is
permitted to the conscience
of the Merchant or owner
therof. (Per. l. si ide|iussor. Qu. satisd. cog. Vide supratit. 17.
Secondly, concerning the
Persons, whose losses are un|der
contribution, he should
first deale with the master,
to retaine all the same goods
on the bottome of the ship,
in his keeping, untill the rate
be set and executed:l. 2 ad l. rhod. or else
may omit all other persons,
and pursue the Skipper ex
conducto: which also ceases,
if the cast goods be found a|gaine.d. l. 2. in fin.
Lastly, concerning the

Master of the Ship his privi|ledge,
it is not onely upon
the detinew, and keeping of
the goods and geere brought
within his ship, which are
thought as by a privie band
to be obliged and given him
in pledge for the fraught, by
common consent of lawyers,
but also for the due and
timely satisfaction of such
contributions; because the
imposed taxation, as likewise
the fraught, is thought to
sticke firmely to the said
goods: and therefore the
Master may hold his hand
thereon, untill satisfaction
be made,l. 1. de dol. mal. excep.  l. si non sortem. de cond. in de. albeit that com|monly

the with-holding of
other mens good be not al|lowed.l. 1. parag, re|diguntur. D. quod vi ut clam.



TIT. XXII.
Of priviledged ships.
SHips or boats serving the
Country, or the Prince,
have great prerogatives.
For first they goe free from
all Imposts, Customs, and
Arrestments,l. 1. de navi|cul. c. lib. 11. not onely in
forth-going, but also in their
returne, according to Frede|ricke
the Emperour his con|stitution.
Auth.  filiu pre patre. Yet if a Skip|per
serving the Prince or
Countrey, wilfully falles
on coastes and by-courses

where he should not, to their
hurt and hinderance, he me|rits
death:l. 5. de navi|cular. C. lib. 11. and the com|manders
or officers in chiefe
parts, who wittingly suffer
such Skippers to lye and slug|ger,
incurre a forfeiture of
all their goods.l. ult. eod.
And if any man shal force
the Skipper of these or any
other ships to take in more
than his just charge, not one|ly
should he upset all hurt
and losse, but also be pub|likely
punished.Art. 49. Il. selectar. naval.
And as these are the con|ditions
of ships serving the
Prince; so is it to be knowne
that all sorts of ships are sub|ject

to this service, upon
command:Vide Tit. de navib. non ex|cusand. C. otherwise in
case they refuse, their ships
shall be confiscat, except they
report a testimony from the
Admirall of very lawfull ex|cusede offic. admir. Ang.
Yea, further is to be no|ted,
that Masters of ships and
Ferriers once so professed, are
bound to serve as well sub|jects
in common, as the
Prince;Albericus ad tit. naut. caup.  in l. unic. furt. adver naut. caup. except they have
left the trade, or be under a
safe conduct, or have taken
in moe, then they can well
carry a ship-board.Bart.  Bald. in d. l. unic.
And this is a common
priviledge to all sort of loa|ded

and burdened ships, to
have the neerest place to the
shore, for their discharge and
unloading; and therefore the
ships lightened, to give them
place.Wisi c. 10.
Lastly, even the persons
who build, purchase, or
dresse shippes expresly for a
common-wealth to their.
Country, are accounted a|mongst
the priviledged:Qui navium de privileg. creditorum.
yea the frequenters of say|ling
are also priviledged in
all Courts.C. Innocenti|us. de for. comp.



TIT. XXIII.
Concerning Shipwracke.
STrangers incurring
shipwracke in Scotland,
should have the same
favour of us that we use to
receive of them in the like
case;138. actor. Iacob. 1. so that no confiscation
should be used against them,
except they use to doe so to
us, or that they be very Pi|rats,
or enemies to Christiani|ty:
L. 1. C. de nau|frag.  auth. naufragia, C. de furt. otherwise, who steals
any such miserable goods,

shall pay foure-fold to the

much to the Prince or his

stealing of a naile, or the
worth thereof, maketh the
thiefe guilty of all, to the ren|dring
of all the remaining
goods.l. 3. in fin. de incend ru. nauf.
Yea, by the Emperour
Antonius his ordinance, this
thiefe or robber of such
goods should be battoned,
and banisht for three yeares,
if he be of any honest ranke;
but if he be base of conditi|on,
should be sent scourged
to the Gallies or metall

mines.l. Pedius 4. eod.
And if any man should be
so cruelly wicked, as to hin|der
the ship-broken men
from helpe in danger, hee
shall be recounted for a mur|therer.Arg. l. Sacc|larij de extra|ord. crim.
And therefore may no
man hinder ships from forth|laying
of Tews  Anchors
upon land:Gaius l. 5. de rer. divis. as was decided
betwixt Couper and Seagy,
Anno 1498. mense Iulij,Tom. 1. regis. Scot.
In like manner, if any
man should be so accursed as
to hold forth a Lanterne in
the night, of intention to
draw on ships to a danger, in
place of a good port or har|bour

or safe roade, that wic|ked
person should be puni|shed
to the death.Per d. arg. l Saccula. i.
Yea, though no harme
happen, yet may the Admi|rall
punish him at his plea|sure:
Per l. 10. de in|cend. ruin. nauf.
And therefore even
Fishers are forbidden to fish
with light in the night, lest
that Sailers thereby be decei|ned
with the false shew of an
harbour.l. ne piscato|res eod.
But for the better eschu|ing
of these cruell evils, Ha|drian
the Emperour ordai|ned,
that all men having
possessions on the coasts,
should attend carefully upon
such chances; otherwise, to be

answerable for al things mis|sing
by stealth or robbery.l. ne quid eod.  auth. naufra|gia. C. de furt.
Item, if no man in due
time claime such a wracke, it
fell of old to the Prince his
customers, according to that
of Hermogenes and Fortuna|tianus,m. Cod. Theo|do.
Naufragia ad pub|licanos
pertinento; but now-adayes
to the Admirall, by
the Princes graunt.
But concerning the action
for shipwracke, it should be
intended within a yeere and
a day,l. si quis. C. de naufrag. lib 11. and sped by the
Iudge within two yeere.Vide l. de Submersis. eod.
Where it is to be marked,
that if the shippe onely pe|rish
and the goods are safe, in

that case the goods shall pay
the fift or the tenth penny;
according to the easie or dif|ficult
winning and saving of
the said goods;Art. 37. leg. naval. Rhod. for gold,
silk, silver,  such like things
of easie transportation,
should pay lesse than goods
of greater weight and diffi|cult
transporting, as being in
greater hazard:Art. 40. eod. except
the Skipper carry-in his ship
to a port or part where hee
should not, nor the Mer|chant
would not; for then is
the Merchant free of all the
Skippers losse,Art. 39. eod. and no
way should upset the spoyled
or broken ship.Art 37. eod.

But in cases of wracke,
the lawes of England are also
to be seene: as, Westm. 1. 3.

TIT. XXIV.
Of things found upon the Sea, or
within the floud-marke.
SHips, goods, or geare,
or whatsoever other
things found within the
Sea or floud thereof, are of
three sorts: as, either found
on the streame floting, and
then are called Floatson: or
found on the Sea bottom, and
drawne up from the same by
Doukers and other meanes;
and then are called Lagon:

or found on land, but with|in
the Sea-floud, as cast forth
there by storme and the wa|ter;
and then are called Ier|son.
Concerning Floatson and
Ieson, whether things be
cast up by shipwrack, or else
left as lost through casting in
stormes, the finders thereof,
as some Lawyers thinke,Faber  alij inst. de rer. di|vis. sect. pen.
should doe therewith, as
with other goods found upo~
land: that is, to proclaime the
same to be forth-comming
to the just owner; because
the loser or ynner of such
goods remaineth still ow|ner
and proprietar thereof:per l. Pom|ponius. parag. fin. de acquir. rer. dom.

and if no man claime, the
finder to keepe it to himselfe
if he be poore.Faber. d. pa|rag. pen. But accor|ding
to the old Rhodian
law, whether the finder be
rich or poore, he may claime
or rather retaine the fift part,
for the safe keepingArt. 45.  46 Il. nava. Rhod. If a
Douker finde drowned
goods upon eight cubits
deepe, hee gaines the third
part; and if on fifteene cu|bits,
then he obtaines the
halfe; but upon one cubite,
onely the tenth part.dd. art.
Yet if the finder be rich,
and hath found goods by
chance, hee should rather
give it to the Church or

poore, as some say.Auth. omnes peregrini com|munio de suc|cessionib.
But now-adayes this go|eth
farre otherwise; first, be|cause
persons endued with
the superiority or signiory of
any part of the Sea-coast, do
claime all or a part of these
things, whether cast forth
of ships, or otherwise com|ming
upon their land,Oleron.
which otherwise before was
allowed to the finder:Eod,
Even so, when shippes or
boats were found on the sea,
or at the coast thereof, with|out
any living creature ther|in,
and no man claiming the
same for the space of a yeere
and a day, then was the halfe

allowed to the finder, and
the remanent to the Prince,
as a derelict:Vide statu. re|gis Alex. Scot but since the
erection and constitution of
Admiralls, this kinde of
found goods are diversly
pared; for in France, the
King, draweth a third, the
Admirall a third, and the
finder a third.L' Admirall de France. And of old,
in England, although such
things were divided twixt
the Admirall and the fin|der,Vide de off. Adm. Ang.
yet now they are left
to the arbitrement of both
Admirals in England and
Scotland, to consider the fin|der
or taker with a condigne
portion, for his travels,

charges, and hazard in all
circumstances;Per diploma|ta. even with
the halfe at least, according
to that which Tryphonius
sets downe, concerning
things found on land.l. Si is qui. 63. in fin. de acq. rer. dom.
Yet, if the finder conceale
such goods, whether an|chors,
timber, jewels, dead|men
with money or jewels
about them, c. he not one|ly
loseth his just part, but
may be also fined at the will
of the Admirall.L' Admiral de France.  d. depl. And
thus farre concerning things
found by the labour and tra|vels
of men.
If Whales, great grosse
fishes, ships, or boats, with|out

any living in them, by
force of winde and waves
onely, be driven to any coast
or land, then all and whole
appertaines to the Admirall:
and so generally, all casual|ties
whatsoever.Per dd. diplo.  de off. Adm.



TIT. XXV.
Of things taken upon Sea.
NOw followeth to
treat of goods taken
upon Sea; which are
of three sorts: for either they
are taken from Pirats, and
sea-thiefes; or from professed
enemies in lawfull warfare;
or from such as not profes|sing
open warre, allowes ta|king
reft to be exercised a|gainst
us. Which kinde of
taking, is covered with the

title of letters of Marque,
called Ius represaliarum.
And first, touching that
which is taken from Pirats,
sith the goods which they
have wrongfully taken from
others, whether they be
found in their owne, or in
their successors possession,
are esteemed to bee a just
prey to any taker, so that
account be made thereof to
the Admirall: in case the ta|ker
finde the goods of his
country man or friend with
the Pirat, hee should make
the same forth-comming to
the just owner claiming the
same; his cost, charges and

hazard, being alwaies consi|dered
and allowed;Per l. Pom|ponius de acq. rei dom. so
that if any man buy or re|deeme
his neighbours ship
from a Pirat or enemy, hee
must receive the price there|of
from the owner.Per l. mulier. de cap.  post. But if
no man claime the goods
taken from a Pirat, then
should the same be delivered
to the Admirall, who ought
to consider the taker with his
due part thereof.
If a ship or goods be ta|ken
by a professed enemy,
who hath not brought it
in praesidia vel locum tutum,
for the making of a prescrip|tion;
or a right, and after|ward

the same is taken back,
and recovered by any friend,
and the just owner claime
the same, it ought to be re|stored
to the owner; for that
by the law, Huiusmodi res
non tam capta qum recepta
intelligitur.Per d. l. Pom|ponius,  per l. in bello. parag. si quis seruum in prae capt.  post. But when such
goods become a just and
lawfull prize to the taker,
then should the Admirall
have a tenth part: for so of
old, the tenth part of lawfull
spoile, was offered to God,
in a manner; as we may
learne by that which Abra|ham
returning from victory
over five Kings, offered to
Melchisedeck:Gen. 14. and the rem|nant

of the spoile should be
proportionally divided a|mongst
the takers, accor|ding
to the law of God, set
downe by Moses,Deu. 20. and
practised by King David;1 Reg. 30,
and yet not onely amongst
severall persons, according
to every man his proved tra|vell
and hazard.c. dicat aliquis parag. 23. q. 5. c. ius milita. re dist. 1. So that
the ship that sets no saile,
fights not, nor hazards not
with the rest, should have
no part with the rest, there|of.
L' Admirall de France. Provided alwaies,
that first and formost, the
prisoners, captives, and ta|ken
goods of preyes, be in
due time presented to the

Captaine, to be disposed by
the Admirall: so that if any
man breake bulk, meddle, or
dispose of any of those goods
before, he may be punished,
and the receiver or buyer
prisoned, untill caution bee
found, that these goods shall
be forth-comming to the
Admirall, and just owner,
according to a decision past
betwixt the King of Scotland
and Maubray, Anno 1487.
17. Iunij.Tom. 1. c. 24. gist. Scot.
If two forraine Nations
be at warre, and the one take
a shippe from the other, and
bring her into a Port or
road within the bounds of a

neutrall Nation, alike friend
to both, then may the Ad|mirall
of that neutrall Nati|on
ordaine that ship so taken
and brought within the said
bounds, to be restored to her
owner; and the persons cap|tives,
to their former liberty,
even as if she had beene
brought backe to her owne
Port and Countrey a|gaine.Per. l. post|liminium. parag. postliminio. de. cap.  postlim.
Besides that, generally in
all cases, the action and cause
of liberty, as priviledged,
should be favourably consi|dered:
Per l. libertas. de reg. iur. and it is the honoura|ble
practice of Princes, to
make their Countreyes an

Asylum, or sanctuary, to all
distressed strangers that bee
not Pirats.
Lastly, concerning letters
of Merque, as we speake, or
droict de Merque, as French|men
tearme it, sive ius repre|saliarum,
and goods and
things taken under that title
upon sea; surely, as farre as
we may, we should prease to
keepe Gods law set downe
by Moses,Deut. 14. 16. practised by
King Amasia,2 Reg 14. 6.  2 Chr. 25. 4. and confir|med
by the Prophets:Ier. 29. 3. Ezech. 18. 20. that
the father should not be pu|nished
for the sonne, nor the
sonne for the father, but a
difference to be alwaies put

betwixt the guilty and the in|nocent.
Which thing moved
Emperours to make consti|tutions
for the repressing of
represalies in certaine re|spects.Vide anhent. imo. C. ne filiu pro patre.
Notwithstanding, if our
patience be so oppressed with
the increase of robberies,
spoyles, and violence upon
sea, by men falsely professing
friends, in such sort that up|on
no supplication, interces|sion,
nor other travels, the
Princes of these wrongfull
Nations (who onely can and
should represse and redresse)
will doe justice, or neglect
to doe their office; then be|cause

such a dealing imports
a iust cause of lawfull hosti|lity
and warfare, I see not
but that such a calamity may
and ought to be repressed, at
least by these represalies and
letters of Merque;Vide Bartol. lat de represal. speci|ally,
sith that cause, in effect,
resembles a warre denoun|ced
without solemnities of
clarigation.
And therefore, both ac|cording
to the lawes of Eng|land,
letters of Merque are

TIT. XXVI.
Of Fishers, fishing, and traf|fiquers
therewith.

and fishing, be
of one kinde, as sub|ject
to a like law and liber|ty,
l. 1. in fin. de acq. rer. om.  parag ferae in|sti. de rer. divis. because what wilde
beast, fowle, or fish be once
taken by any man, common|ly
it becommeth his owne
proper by the lawes of Nati|ons;
yet is there a difference
twixt these three: for, albeit

hunting and hawking be al|most

yet fishing is forbidden in o|ther

and lakes,l. iniuriorum 13. parag. fin. in fin. de iniur. Iacob. 3. act 60.  Iacob. 5. p. 4. cap. 12. as comparable

Yea, now a-daies, in ri|vers,

be forbidden, but no
private man, without the
grant of the Prince, upon a|ny
pretence, or allegation of
long consuetude and pre|scription,
may acquire the
propriety of any such part
of the sea, as to prohibite

others to fish there also;l. prascrip de usucap.

and statutes.Vide statuta,  constit.  act. regu~ Franc. Angl.  Scotiae. Which
Princes also (for the increase
of fishes) have, as it were

Yea, albeit that any man
were of old infefted with
keeping of crwiffes, weares,

keepe the Saturdaies slop:
that is, to lift the same from

except for taking of smelts,
loches, and such like that will

to set the same upon the wa|ters,
that the mid-streame

paine of five pound.Iac 3. p. 10. cap. 73 And
thus farre concerning the
maintenance and increase of
fishes, by our Scottish lawes

It followeth, to set downe
concerning the Fishers their
safety and priviledges. Wher|in
it is provided, first, that
all Shippes sayling into the
parts where Herring are ta|ken,
at least during the ta|king
thereof, shall let downe
aile after day light past, let
their Anchor fall, and keepe
watch with Lanterne and
light, untill day light appeare

again, lest otherwise the poor
Fishers should be over-run,
or their nets broken: their
paine in Denmarke, is death
to the transgressors:Denmarke. and
the Fishers are likewise for|bidden
to use light in their fi|shing
by night, lest they de|ceive
saylers with the false
shew of a port.Vlpian in l. ne pifcatores de incend. ui. naufr.
Likewise, lest any of the Fi|shers
harme or hurt one ano|ther,
it is diversly provided, as
also co~cerning the right mea|sure
of their nets in length 
in bredth;Vide l' Admi|rall de Franc. as may be seen
by the Statutes of sundry na|tions

And specially therfore it is

agreed of long time sithence,
by the Sea-farers on the
Forth of Scotland;Vide Forman his Register. first,
that no ground-draffe or
drag-net, be set before
March, nor upon deeper
water then fourteene fa|thome.
Item, that none shall lye
to their neighbours when he
shall be asked concerning
the length and depth of his
tewe, when he is in driving:
neither yet wittingly and
wilfully to suffer his tewes
and nets to flit, and runne o|ver
one another, under the
paine of ten pound for every
transgression of the premi|sed

articles.
Item, above all, that from
the Sun-set on Sonday, no
man lay nor hale nets or
great lines, or exercise any
labour, under the foresaid
paine.
Item, for the further in|couraging
of Fishers in the
West and North Isles of
Scotland, there is a Statute
that no other customes be
sought of the Fishers in the
said Ies, but only the Kings
customes; under the paines
due to manifest oppressors
against them who exact the
same.Mar. p. 6. c. 5
Lastly, concerning Fishers

and traffiquers with fishes, it
is ordained that not onely all
fish slaine and taken neere
to the coast of Scotland, be
brought and presented to
the market places, where
the takers or slayers thereof
dwell:Iacob. 5. p. 9. c. 98. but also all fishes
taken in the North and
West Isles or Firths, to be
brought directly to the
townes where the Fishers
dwell (that the need of the
countrey may be first ser|ved)
Iac. 6 p. 4. c. 0. and presented to the
market places: from which
none may carry them away
to packe and peil, but one|ly
betwixt the houres of ele|ven

and two in the after|noone,
under the paine of
confiscation. In which mar|kets,
it is lawfull to the Pro|vost
 Bailffes to set downe
prices, and to compell the
packer and peiler to sell a|gaine
for the need of the
Lieges.Iac. 5. p. 7. c. 98 Which being
done, they may transport the

barrelling of fishes, it is
ordained that the measures

prescribed of old shall be
kept: videlicet, each barrell
of Herring, or of white fish,
to be of twelve galons;Iac. 5. p. 4. c. 57 Iac. 6 p. 4. c. 147.

TIT. XXVII.
Of the Community and Propri|ety
of the Seas.
HAving of late seene
and perused a very
learned, but a subtle
Treatise (incerto authore) in|tituled
Mare liberum, contai|ning
in effect a plaine Pro|clamation
of a liberty com|mon
for all of all Nations,
to fish indifferently on all
kinde of Seas, and conse|quently,
a turning of un|doubted

proprieties to a
community; as the fift chap|ter
thereof at large discovers
(wherein the unknowne
Authour protesteth, that he
may for his warrant use the
authority and words of such
old Writers as have beene
esteemed most mighty in the
understanding and judging
upon the naturall condition
of things here below) and
the Discourse, being co|vered
with the maintenance
of a liberty to saile to the
Indians; I thought alwaies
expedient by occasion of
this argument of fishing con|tained
in my former Title,

by Gods grace, to occurre
thereunto; as manifestly di|rect,
at least (in my weake
sight) tending to the preju|dice
of my most worthy
Prince and his subjects; and
that not onely by arguments
derived from the first verity
of the nature of things, but
also from his owne proofs,
warrants, and their Au|thors.
And yet before I goe any
further, I cannot passe the
Authour his ridiculous pre|tence,
in both Epistle and
beginning of his Discourse;
as for a liberty onely to
saile on Seas: a thing farre

off from all controversie, at
least upon the Ocean; speci|ally,
since passage upon land
through all Regions Chri|stian,
is this day so indiffe|rently
permitted to all of all
Nations, even to Turkes,
Iewes, Pagans, not being
professed enemies; and ther|fore
much lesse to be restrai|ned
on Sea in all respects. So
that I cannot but perswade
both my selfe, and other loy|all
subjects, that the said pre|tence
is but a very pretence;
and so much the more to be
suspected as a drift against
our undoubted right and
propriety of fishing on this

side the Seas.
Now remembring the
first ground, whereby the
Authour would make Mare
Iherum, to be a position for|tified
by the opinions and
sayings of some old Poets,
Orators, Philosophers, and
(wrested) Iurisconsults, that
Land and Sea, by the first
condition of nature, hath
beene and should be com|mon
to all, and proper to
none: against this I minde to
use no other reason, but a
simple and orderly reciting
of the words of the holy Spi|rit,
concerning that first con|dition
naturall of Land and

Sea from the very beginning;
at which time, God having
made and so carefully to|ward
man disposed the foure
Elements, two to swimme
above his head, and two to
lye under his feet: that is to
say, the Earth and Water,
both wonderfully for that
effect ordered to the up-ma|king
of one and a perfect
Globe, for their more mutu|all
service to mans use: accor|ding
to this, immediately af|ter
the creation, God saith to
man,Genes. 1. 28. Subdue the earth, and
rule over the fish: which
could not be, but by a subdu|ing
of the waters also.

And againe, after the
Floud, God saith, Replenish
the earth:eod. c. 9. v. 1. and for the bet|ter
performance hereof,
God in his justice against the
building of Babylon, scat|tred
man-kinde over all the
face of the earth;eod c. 11. v 8. there|fore
is it that Moses saith,eod. c. 10 v. 5.
These are the Iles of the Nati|ons
divided in their lands. So
that hereby is evident that
things here done, are not so
naturally too common;
sith God the author of na|ture,
is also as well author of
the division, as of the co~posi|tion:
and yet howsoeuer,

in his justice as is said, yet in
his mercy also and indulgent
care, for the welfare and
peace of mankinde. For
those are sentences both vul|gar
and sure, set downe by
the Romane Iurisconsults,Vlp. l qui ne|que. de reb eor. quisub utel.
Communio parit discordiam.
Quod communiter possidetur,
vitio naturali negligitur. Ha|bet
communio rerum gerenda|rum
difficultatem.l. paer. parag. dulussi de leg. 2.
Afterward, the earth, by
the infinite multiplication of
mankinde, being largely re|plenished,
and therefore of
necessity thus divided and
things upon the earth not
sufficient for the necessaries

and desires of man in every
region, followed of force
the use of trading vpon the
seas; not onely for the ruling
of the fish therein, according
to the commandement given
by the Creator at the begin|ning,
but also for transpor|ting
of things necessary for
the use of man. For the
which, and other causes a|bove
mentioned, the waters
became divisible, and requi|ring
a partition in like man|ner
with the earth; accor|ding
to that of Baldus: Vide|mus,
de iure gentium, in mare
esse regna distincta, sicut in ter|ra
arida.Ad legem 1 de rer. divis.

And thus farre have we
learned, concerning the com|munity
and propriety of land
and sea, by him who is the
great Creator and authour
of all; and therefore of grea|ter
authority and understan|ding
then all the Grecian
and Romane Writers, Poets,
Orators, Philosophers, and
Iurisconsults, who-so-ever
famous: whom the author of
Mare liberum protests he may
use and leane o without of|fence.
Now, sith the weaknesse
of this his first and principal
ground doth this way ap|peare;
let any man judge

upon the truth of that which
Cicero (his man) sets down,1. officior.
Sunt privata natur a nulla; and
likewise of all other his au|thors
their opinions, for the
fortification of an originall
community of things.
It followeth to examine
the chiefe warrants of Mare
liberum; and to consider how
farre they may beare forth
to a common liberty for fi|shing,
on all seas indifferent|ly.
The author cites Vlpian,
a renowned Iurisconsult in|deed,
and Martian their sen|tences;
alleagingpagina 25. that
Vlpian should say,l. iniuriarum. parag. ult.  parag. si quis de in iur. Ante

aedes meas aut praetorium ut pis|cari
aliquem prohibeam, usur|patum
quidem est, sed nullo iu|re,
adeo ut contempta ea usur|patione,
iniuriarum agere po|test.
sz. prohibitus. That is to
say, if I should forbid any
man to fish before my house,
he may mis-know such an u|surpation,
and intend action
of injury against me, for a
wrongfull staying him from
fishing there.
But as I read,d. prag. si quis. Vlpian his
words are thus; Sunt qui pu|tant
iniuriarum me agere posse:
that is, there are men who
thinke, I may intend action,
c. It is true also, that Mar|tian

saith, Nemo ad littus pis|candi
causa accedere prohibe|tur.
l. 4. de. rer. divis. And yet neither of
these two Iurisconsults, pro|nounceth
absolutely in these
cases, but upon another high|er
warrant: and therefore
Vlpian addes, Saepissime rescrip|tum
est nc piscari, c. prohi|bere
posse.d. parag. si quis in fin. That is, it is
by writ most often answe|red,
c. Which Martian ex|pounds
most clearely, when
he saith, Nemo igitur ad littus
maris piscandi causa accedere
prohibetur; and subjoynes his
warrant, Id Divus Pius
piscatoribus Formianis re|scripsit:
d. l . de rer divis. that is, No man

is forbidden to come to the
sea side and fish; as the Em|perour
Divus Pius did write
to the Fishers of Formian. So
that you see the Emperours
to have been warrants to
these Lawyers, and their writ|ten
opinions, concerning the
voyage of the sea.
Now, to passe the propri|ety
which hereby we see
these Emperours did claime
on the seas, I aske first, to
whom did the Emperours
write such resolutions? was
it not to the professed sub|jects
of their owne Empire?
and what? even the usage of
the seas, and coasts of their

Empire, to be indifferently
common to every one of
their own subjects: and how?
Iure gentium; that is, according
to the law kept by all other
nations, to every one of their
own nation in like cases.
Moreover, albeit these
and other Romane Law|yers
pronounce so, concer|ning
the community of the
sea-shoare, and coast, that
private men may build hou|ses
within the floud-marke,
and appropriate them to
themselves, according to
that which Neratius writes,
Quod in littore quis aedificat,
eius fit:l. quod in lit|tore. de aeq. rer. dom. that is, what

a man builds on shoare, it be|commeth
his owne; yet up|on
this condition, Tamen de|cretum
praetoris adhibendum
est ut id facere liceat, saith
Pomponius:l. quamvis. de acq. rer dom. that is, provi|ding
the Praetor his decree
be interponed thereunto; or
that the Prince give grant, as
Vlpian writes;l. prohibere. parag quod et si. Quod vi aut elam. Vel ut prin|ceps
concedat. As for the rem|nant
of these sorts of war|rants
alledged for Mare libe|rum,
sith they sing all one
song for the common use to
the people, and propriety to
the Prince, if men will but
onely marke them; I need
not stay further upon them.

So that every man may see
both the use of the word
commune, and the meaning of
Iure gentium among these
Lawiers, whereupon this
Mare liberum appeares so to
be founded, that it cannot
be shaken. For, commune,
there is nothing else but pub|lieum,
qasi populicum; signi|fying
a thing common for
the usage of any of one sort
of people, and not for all of
all nations: according to that
of Modestinus, Roma commu|nis
patria est.l. Roma. ad municipal.
Neither yet doth that
word, Iure gentium, meane a|ny
law set downe by com|mon

consent of all nations;
but onely notes the example
of the law, or custome of o|ther
nations: as if they would
say, the liberty of fishing on
our seas, and of other doing
there and at shoare, should be
common to every one of the
Romane Empire, like as
the same is common to all
of all other nations,
on their seas, and their
shoares.
Likewise, that of Placen|tinus;
Quod mare sit in nul|lius
bonis, nisi solius dei: that
is, GOD is onely Lord of
the sea; and so say we with
King David, that the land

also is the Lords.Psalme. But that
of Faber,Ad parag. lit|torum inst. de rer. divis. Mare esse in pri|maevo
iure quo omnia erant
communia, I need no other|wise
to refute now, than I
have done above alrea|dy.
And these are the Authors
and warrants whereupon
Mare liberum inferres his
conclusion; Demonstra|tum
igit ur nec populo, nec pri|vato
ius aliquod in mare
competere posse, quum occupa|tionem,
nec natura, nec
publici usus ratio permittat.Pag. 28.
Which, how it followeth
upon the premisses, let men
judge; sith neither these

his Authors make for him,
neither yet the reason inser|ted
in the conclusion beares
out; which is, quum occupa|tionem
nec natura, nec publici
usus ratio permittat: that is,
neither nature, nor the com|mon
need, suffers the sea to
be acquired in property to a|ny
occupation.
For answer, first concer|ning
the nature of the sea, as
supposed impossibly occupa|ble
or acquirable; Is this so
thought because the sea is
not so solid, as is the land,
that men may trade thereon,
as upon land? or that it is
continually flowing to ad

fro? Surely, that lacke of so|lidity
for man his trading
thereon by foot, shall not
hinder the solid possession of
it, farre lesse the occupation
and acquiring, if we will give
to the sea, that which the Iu|risconsults
indulgently grant
to the land, which also can|not
be denied. Paulus the
Iurisconsult saith,In l. possideri. de acquir. poss. Qui
fundum possidere velit, non u|tique
omnes glebas eius circum|ambulet,
sed sufficit quamlibet
partem eius introire, dum men|te
 cogitatione hac sit ut to|tum
possidere velit usque ad
terminum: that is, it is not
needfull for him who would

possesse himselfe in any part
of the land, to goe about
and tread over the same; but
it is sufficient to enter-in up|on
any thereof, with a mind
to possesse all the rest there|of,
even to the due marches.
And what can stay this to
be done on sea, as well as on
land? And thus farre concer|ning
the solidity.
As for the flowing condi|tion
of the sea, howsoever
it be liquid, fluid, and unsta|ble,
in the particles thereof,
yet in the whole body, it is
not so: because it keepes the
prescribed bounds strictly
enough,Psal. 104. 9. concerning the

chiefe place and limits there|of.
VVhich discourse, gives
us occasion of force to an|swere
to a scoffe cast in by
the Author of Mare liberum,
concerning the possibility
also of marches and limits,
for the division of the seas:Pag. 38.
Mundum dividunt (saith the
foreaid Authour of Mare
liberum) non ullis limitibus,
aut natura, aut manupositis,
ed imaginaria quadam linea:
quod si recipitur,  Geo|metrae
terras,  Astronomi
coelum nobis eripient: that
is, they divide the world,
not by any marches,

put either by nature, or by
the hand of man, but by an
imaginary or fantastick line:
which kinde of doing being
embraced, the Geometers
may steale away the earth,
and the Astronomers the
heavens from us.
It is true, that there are not
in every part of the sea Iles
sensible (as Gernsey is to Eng|land
in the narrow seas) or
sands (as the Washes at the
West seas of England) nor
rockes, or other eminent and
visible markes above water,
for the designation of the
bounds (or laying-out the
limits) of the divisible parts

thereof: but GOD, who is
both the distributer and first
Author of the diuision and
distinction of both land and
sea, hath given an understan|ding
heart to man for the
same effect, as well as for all
other necessary actions
wherein he hath to employ
himselfe: so that to a very
wonder, God hath diversly
informed men by the helpes
of the Compasse, counting
of courses, sounding, and o|ther
waies, to finde forth, and
to designe finitum in infinito;
so farre as is expedient for
the certaine reach  bounds
of seas, properly pertaining

to any Prince or people.
Which bounds Bartolusinsect. nullius in tractat. de insula.
hardily extends and allowes
for Princes and people at the
sea side, an hundreth miles of
sea forth from their coasts,
Per l notio|nem de verb. Sig. at least; and justly, if they
exercise a protection  con|servacy
so far: and this reach
is called by the Doctors,
Districtus maris,  territori|um.
Gloss in c. ubi periculum. pa|rag. porro. de electionib. lib. 6. It is true, Baldusm l. si testa|mentum. de inst.  subst. e|steemeth
potestatem, iurisdi|ctionem  districtum, to be all
one.
To conclude then, since
Papinian writes in finalibus
quaestionibus vetera monumen|ta
sequenda esse;l. in finalibus. com. divid. what more

evident monuments for our
King his right in the narrow
seas, then these Isles of Gern|sie?
c. And for the Eastern
seas, direct from Scotland,
what is more antiently no|torious
than that covenant
twixt Scottish men and Hol|landers,
concerning the
length of their approaching
toward Scotland by way of
fishing?
And thus farre through oc|casion
of answering to that
alleadged impossibility, of
acquiring the Sea by occu|pation,
because (as would
appeare) of the unsolidity
therof, for any foot treading.

It rests to touch the other
cause naturall, for that other
impossibility, which may be
the continuall fluxe and in|stability
of the Sea; in such
sort, that it would appeare
not aye to be one and the
selfe same body, but daily
changeable. For answer, I
must remember that which
the Iurisconsult sets downe
so prettily:In l propon|baur. de iud., Suppose (sayes
he) a certaine Colledge of
Iudges, or a Legion of Soul|diers,
or the particular parts
of a Ship, or of a mans bo|dy,
should so continually
and often be changed and
altred, that none of that first

Colledge or Legion could
be found alive, nor yet any
part of the Shippe or body
could be so certainly demon|strate,
that it might be affir|med
for the very same that it
was at the first; yet if that
Colledge or egion be in
number full, and the ship or
man whole and able in all the
frame, they shall be accoun|ted
and esteemed not to be
new, but to be the very same
which they were at the be|ginning:
even so, however
the sea many waies and hour|ly
changes, in the small parts
thereof, by the ordinary rush
on land, mixture with other

waters, swelling in it selfe, ex|halation
and backe receipts
thereof by raine; yet since
the great body of the Sea
most constantly keepes the
set place prescribed by the
Creator, I see not in this re|spect
neither, wherefore the
nature of the Sea should not
yeeld to occupation and con|quest.
And thus farre concer|ning
Mare liberum his last
and great conclusion, against
all appropriation thereof by
people or Princes. I call it his
last great conclusion, be|cause
of other two passing
before, whereof the first is
this; Mare igitur proprium

alicuius fieri non potest, quia
natur a iubet esse commune:Pag. 21.
and for what reason? Even
because Cicero, Virgil, and
Plautus have said so. To
whom I could also assent
concerning the great, huge,
and maine body of the sea.
His next conclusion is this;
Est igitur mare in numero eo|rum
quae in commercio non
unt, hoc est, quae proprij iuris
fieri non possunt:Pag. 25. that is,
The Sea to be of that order
of things, which cannot bee
appropriate to any man.
His warrants for his conclu|sion
also are the Romane
Lawyers, whom I said to be

wrested by Mare liberum; and
therefore must shew the
same, contrary to his pur|pose
indeed. Martianus,l. si quisquam divers  temp. praescrip. as
the Authour of Mare liberum
largely grants,Pag. 24. saith, that
if any private man have him|selfe
alone, by any lawfull
space of time sufficient for a
prescription, kept and exer|cised
fishing in any reeke or
nooke of Sea, which they
call Diverticulum; hee may
forbid all others to fish ther|in:
which Papinianusl. praescriptio de usu cap. also
confirmeth. The which, as
I accept, so I would further
demand of him. By what
reason should a private man,

who hath no other care nor
respect but to himselfe alone,
be thus priviledged and pre|ferred
to a Prince? who not
for himselfe; but for his peo|ple
also in common, yea and
for the safety of all traders
passing his coasts, with great
charges and care protects
and conserveth the Seas nee|rest
unto him: shall not this
Prince be acknowledged, at
least with the good which
that Sea, conserved by him,
offers so directly to him?
And I pray you say, What
lesse authority had Leo than
the rest of the Romane Em|perours,
to grant to every

one in particular, having
possessions at the Sea side, as
much of the ea as was nee|rest
against their lands,Novell. const. 102. 103.  104.
with the fishings thereof?
What then, shall not Princes
be equalled, in these cases,
with subjects? Or rather,
have not all Princes a like
right  power within their
own precinct and bounds, as
these Roman Princes had?
But now to draw neerer to
the chiefe point of our pur|pose,
and so to the end there|of:
as I accepted Mare li|berum
his former large
graunt, so now also doe I
more heartily embrace the

next, which is this; When
after these his conclusions, he
had said in tanto Mari siquis
piscatu arceret, insanae cupidi|tatis
notam non effugeret:pag. 30.
he subjoynes according to
that of Cicero,Off. 1. Quando
sine detrimento suo quis potest
alteri communicare in ijs quae
sunt occupanti utilia  danti
non molesta, quid ni faceret:
and subjoynes afterward,pag. 35.
Et si quicquam eorum prohibe|re
posset, puta piscaturam, qua
dici quodammodo potest pis|ces
exhauriri: that is to
say, If the uses of the
Seas may bee in any re|spect
forbidden and stayed,

it should be chiefly for the fi|shing,
as by which the fishes
may be said to bee exhaust
and wasted; which, daily ex|perience
these twenty yeres
past and more, hath decla|red
to be over true: for wher|as
aforetime the white fishes
daily abounded even into all
the shoares on the Easterne
coast of Scotland; now for|sooth
by the neere and daily
approaching of the busse Fi|shers
the sholes of fishes are
broken, and so farre scattered
away from our shores and
coasts, that no fish now can
be found worthy of any
paines and travels; to the im|povershing

of all the sort of
our home-fishers, and to the
great damage of all the Na|tion.
Whereby, I see at last,
the Author of Mare liberum
not so addict to serve any
mans particular desires, as to
answer (forsooth) to his pro|fession
of the lawes, that is, to
allow the proper right for
every man and nation, and
to hurt none; according to the
three generall precepts of all
lawes, set down by Caius,in l. iustitia. de rer. divis.
and after him by ribonia|nus:
Parag iuris praecepta. de iust.  iur. Honest vivere; alte|rum
non laedere;  ius suum
cuique tribuere: whereof the
second tryes and rules the

rest; according to the vulgar
saying out of Pomponius,l. nem de reg. iur.  l. 14. de cond. indeb.  l. iue. de iure dot.
Neminem debere cum alterius
damno locupletari: and that
of Tryphonius,l. rescriptum de distract. pig. Ex aliena
iactura lucrum haurire non o|portet.
And therefore I would
meet him with his deserved
courtesie; even to proclaime
Mare liberum also: I meane
that part of the maine Sea or
great Ocean, which is farre
removed from the just and
due bounds above mentio|ned,
properly pertaining to
the neerest Lands of every
Nation. Atque ita esto mare
vastum liberrimum.



TIT. XXVIII.
Of War-fare shippes, and of the
Captaines and Companies
thereof.
ANd since wee have
written above of pri|viledged
shippesTit. 22. a|mongst
which the warfare-ships
of Princes are first and
chiefe) and somewhat of the
conservacy of the Seas, in the
last title; I cannot here passe
the warfare-shippes un|mentioned,
albeit not in such
large manner and measure

as their imployment now-a-dayes
requires. As for the
matter fit for their building,
and things necessary for
their forth-setting and pre|paration
to Sea, I must refer
the same to Iulius Ferretus,
and to Vegetius, who have
written largely thereupon.
Some touch I have here sub|joyned,
in the last Title of
this Booke, concerning the
materials: as likewise some|what
is premitted concer|ning
their priviledges, in that
Title of priviledged shippes.
Therefore would I here set
downe (but very briefly)
some thing concerning the

Captaines, Commanders,
 Companies of the Prince
his warfare-ships, the graces
 vertues required in them,
with their duties, power and
preferment.
Captaines of Princes war|fare-shippes
should be men,
first, fearing God, because
they must continually walke
in the midst of the wondrous
workes of God. Next, they
should be stout, hardy, and
couragious. Thirdly, vigi|lant,
diligent, and carefull;
and therefore very tempe|rate
on Sea:Ferretus. specially, be|cause
their imployment, as it
is full of hazard and danger,

even so are their occasions
and opportunities sudden
and momentanie. There|fore
their commandement
and power over their com|pany,
not onely surpasseth
the power of Masters and
Commanders of private
shippes, but also that of the
Captaines on land; and
therefore their honour and
estimation every way high|er
also, because of their grea|ter
charge, care, and ha|zard.
Their duty toward
their company, is first, that
they chuse such as bee free
from hainous and scanda|lous
offences.per. l. 4. de re militar. Next,

that they suffer none of their
company to bee idle, but to
punish as well the sluggard
as the rebellious:per l. 6. eod. yea, e|ven
those who are irreve|rent
towards them;per. l. 13. eod. and
againe, should with all lo|ving
care see to the due
food of their company, heare
their mutuall plaints, hold
them in peace by all obe|dience,
visit, refresh, and
with all helpes comfort the
hurt and diseased.per l. 12. eod: As
for the Captaines their other
duties to the Prince and Ad|mirall,
with their owne pri|viledges,
they are all gathe|red
out of old customes,

and at large set downe in
that Booke called L' Admirall
de France.



TIT. XXIX.
Of Watermen and Ferriers.
FErryers and Water|men
are bound to serve
all true Lieges for their
due fare;per l. 1. parag. si furt. advers. naut. so that they may
be compelled thereunto:l. 1.  l. cum navarchorum. C. de navicul. lib 10  l. liti|ca de public.
and most, justly, because it
was in their owne hand and
power from the beginning
to give and apply themselves
to that calling and trade, or
not. And if therefore they

faile, it shall be, according to
the law of Scotland, a point
of dittay or inditement a|gainst
them in the first Iu|stice-court;
and if they trans|gresse
unto the third time,
they may be suspended from
their trade,Iac. 3. parl. 13. c. 95. except they
can alleadge a just cause; as,
of feud or hostility.
Item, it is ordained, for
the easier boating and lan|ding
of men and beasts, that
Ferriers make, and have
ready, fit and convenient
bridges, or else to lose their
Boats.Iac. parl. 31. c. 20.
Lastly, Ferriers and Wa|termen

are no lesse bound,
than Skippers and Masters
of shippes, to render againe
what-ever they receive to
bee carried within their
Boats.l. 1. parag. naut. caupou.
But concerning their ordi|nary
fares and hires, it is
neither needfull nor expedi|ent
in this place to recite the
divers statutes made there|upon;
because that first they
are at great length set downe
in the Statutes of England
and Scotland: next, be|cause
their fraughts have
beene, according to the
rate of times, changed and
altered even to the triple, as

specially in ScotlandVide act. Iac. 3 arl 3. c. 20.  arl. 7. c. 61.  ariae. parl. 5. . 21. So
that now also, according to
the condition of this time,
their portage, fraughts or
fare, may be of new conside|red
by his Majestie, or Ad|miralls,
according to the
quality of the boats, and the
space of passage and time,
either shorter, longer, or ha|zardfuller,
during their ser|vice;
but with a due Proviso,
for the repressing of their
rude and uncivill manners.
For truely, if the Roman Iu|risconsults
might of old by
any reason call Mariners, in
generall, Pessimum genus ho|minum,
Vide tit. naut. . up. . tit. furt. vers. (which in these

latter dayes for the most part
is amended, partly through
Christianity and civill con|versation,
 partly; by good
lawes, praise be to God) then
may wee now use that same
still, at least against the most
part of Watermen and Ferri|ers;
as requiring to be refor|med,
or at least by correcti|on
repressed.Secund. l. 3. naut. caup.



TIT. XXX.
Of Shipwrights.
TO conclude this
Treatise, there remai|neth
a speciall sort of
persons to be considered and
respected, as the forgers and
framers of the instrumentall
causes of all Sea-faring; to
wit, Shippe-wrights, and
builders of Ships or Boats,
called by the Romans, imita|ting
the Grecians, Naupegi:
and by the Italians, follow|ing

the latter Grecians, Cala|fatti,
as is above described;Tit. 6.
and therefore subject to the
jurisdiction of the Admiral|ty
Per diplom. admiralior. u|triusque regni. as accountable to the
Admirall and his Iudges) as
accessories of sea causes, for
their skill, diligence, and du|tifull
discharge in every re|spect,
by a frame not onely
likely  comely, but a worke
also strong, ticht, and dura|ble:
or else they must under|goe
the pains of the law, cal|led
Lex Aquilia; that is to say,
all costs and scath happening
by their unskilfulnesse, neg|ligence,
or what-ever other
fault or amisse.Per T. T. ad l. Aquil.

And therefore, first touch|ing
the materials, they should
not onely furnish the same
good and sufficient, but al|so,
if the furniture pertain not
to them, they must refuse to
take from the furnishers bad
and vnmeet geare and stuffe
for the worke.Per l. 2. de naut .  per Vegetium de re militar As for ex|ample,
Aller, Beech trees,
and such like brickle and
naughty timber for salt-wa|ter,
or for the seas. Neither
should they put greene tim|ber
in worke; but ought to
fore-see if they can, that their
wood be cut downe either at
the wane of the Moone, and
in the deepe of Winter, or at

such time as experience de|clares
wood to be most so|lide
and durable. For timber
cut at the contrary times, is
commonly full of moysture;
and therefore being after|ward
dryed, becomes clung,
and open to receive water.
The like care and skill is
required in the iron, and all
other necessaries, to the end
that the workes may prove
strong, durable, right, and
comely. This being done, it
resteth to consider their
hires and fees: which be|cause
they ordinarily depend
on the conditions agreed up|on
with the party, which

also commonly is cavelled
withall before a full perfor|mance
of their worke, upon
surmises and quarrels; there|fore
to occurre to all such
doubts and discords, the con|tracts
of such bargaines
should be (after the example
of other seafaring dealings)
made before the Admiralls
deputy or Iudge, and regi|stred
in their bookes.Vide sup. of the Admirall Clerke.
Last of all, as Shippe|wrights
were of old,l. fin: C. de poen. so are
they also of late, forbidden,
Vide de off. Adm. Ang. under paine of treason, to
communicate their skill and
Art to enemies and barba|rous
people.Vide C. de mnp.  ibi. DD.

Likewise, they are forbid|den
(as are also all other so|cieties
of handy-crafts-men
and trades-men) to conspire
among themselves to en|hance
their wages, or
hire, or to receive
excessive wa|ges.Vide de off. Adm.
FINIS.
