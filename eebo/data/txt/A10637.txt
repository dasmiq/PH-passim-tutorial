 Expliciunt capitula





 Here begynnyth a merualous reuelacion that was shewyd of almyghty god by sent Nycholas to a monke of Eyshamme in the days of kynge Rychard the fyrst And the yere of our lord. M C. Lxxxxvi  Ca primum
Na Monasterye called Euyssham there was a cer ten yong man turnyd wyth feythfull deuocyon fro thys worldys vanyte to the lyfe of a Monke the whiche abowte the begynnyng of hys conuersion fye in to a grete and a greys sekenes and by the space of xv monthis was sore labouryd with grete febulnes and wekenes of body. Also hys stoma ke abhortyde so gretly mete  drynke that sum tyme by the space of. ix. days or more he myght resceye noothyng but a lytyll wanne watyr. And what sum eyr thyng of leche crafte or fesyke any ma~ne dedde o hym for hys conforte or hys amendyment noo thyng hym helpyd but al turnyd contrarye. Therfore he lay seke in hys bedde gretly destitute of bodely strenght. so that he myght not moue hym selfe fro one place to anothyr butte by helpe of ser|uauntes. Alsoo in thre the laste monethys of hys sekenesse he was more sorer diseasyd and feblyd thanne euer he was before. Neuerthelesse than com myng on the feste of estur. sodenly he beganne sum what to amende in hys bodely myghtys  with his staffe walkyd aboute the fermorye. Sothly on thes euyn of sherethursoaye in the whiche nyght the office and ernyce of our lorde thesu criste ys tradycyon 

passyon was solenly songe wyth grete deuocyon  wente with his staffe to the chirche with his brethere~ the whiche by cause of seknesse rested hm also with hym in the fermorye where the couent nyghy seruy|ce and landes offerd vppe to owre lord And there by the respecte of heuynly grace so grete compuncci|on and swetenesse he resceyued that hys holy deno cyon excedyd mesure. wherefore he myght not con teyne hym fro wepyng and laudyng god fro myd nyghte tyl sex of the belle in the mornyng. what for remembryng wyth worshippe and ioye the merceis of owre lord. the whiche he hath doon for mankin de. And alsoo remembryng wyth sore wepyng his offencys and synnys doon by fore tyme. and the hurte and the state of hys present imperfeccyon. And abowte sex of the belle in the mornyng he made to be called to hym ii of hys bretheren one aftyr anothyr. whyche hadd power to here confessyons and gyue to penytentys absolucyon and to them bothe made purely and holly as mekyll as he cowde his fession of al his sennys and of the leest offe~ce of his religyon or of the co~mawndementis of god and wyth grete tricio~ of herte and effusion of e|ris desired his absolucion and had hi Than on of hem askid hym why he sorowde and wepte so i~mode rately for al thei had wente that he shulde fele hym selfe sone to passe owte of thys worlde Than he sei|de he felte hym selfe no thing so Sothly tha~ he tool|de to his brother y^t diligently enquyryde this of hym and seide Sir e shal vndirstonde and know that

thys laste night whenne we were togedyr in chap|tur howse. y resceyuyd so grete swrtenesse of herte and gladnesse of sowle. that onnethis y myghte hoolde or bere my selfe. He askyd also and hyt we re by the relygion that the priors shuld gene that nyght to the bretheren dyscyplynys in hooly vesture and abys. And whenne he herd hym enquyre this he hadde wente that he had seyd hyt of grete febulnesse of his hedde. or by alyenacion of hys mynde. the whiche perauenture he hadde falle in by his infirmyte and inmodere weping or fastyng howe be hit that he with hym ad meruailo wisda~ and discrecion al the tyme of hys sekenesse. wher|fore he co~mendyd hym to our lord no thing els en quyring of hym  so went his weye The seke bro|ther spendyd al that daye in landyng and presyng god And the next night folowing after he hade slepte a lityll while rose vp of his bed And when the chaptur was ro~ge as the tyme requyred to calle the conent to mates. he went than to cherche as he did the daye before Sothely how he behauyd hym then~e in the chirche. and whan he went thens hit shalle be schewyd in his wordys foloyng


 Howe he laye strate al his body in the chaptur how as he had be dedde Ca ii
oN the morow nexte foloyng that ys good fredaye whenne the coent rose to cum to chirche to seye prime. as they ede afore the

chaptur hous they sawe the same seke brother lye po strate  bare foote before the abbot is sete his face was flate to the ground as thaugh he shuld by the ordyr aske mercy of euery presydent. Than the bre theren seyng this meruelyd  ra~ne thedir  willing to take hym vp. they founde hym as a man lyfeles without any mocyon of any membre of his body. Trewly his yes ware falle doun depe into his hed  tho yes  nose of him ware blody or as a manne had oyr leyde hem with mekyl bloode. wherfore they seyde alle that he was dede. His feete ware ful coolde but in the remuande of his body was found a lytyl warmenes No mouing of his pypys might be knowen long tyme And a the last onnethis bit was perseyuyd in him a litill thynne breth  amo|nyng of his herte. Thenne they weshid his hedde breste. handys and feete with colde watyr And than first they sawe al hys body a lityl to tremyl  quake. but aoon he sesyd and was insensybulle So long tyme they musyd and dowtyd what they might do to hym. whyle they sawe hym not verily dedde. nothyr any thing amendyng. At the last by conselle they had him to his bedde  there to be kepte with grete attendans of kepers


 Of the blody figure of the crosse  Ca iii
tHe mene whyle the brehetren merueled wondred on suche a soden happe  beyng of the seke brother  more they wo~drid. howe hyt

. and in what wise without any helpe he yght come thedir to that place. whthe  was Sothely othir thynges that nowe folo the whic  telle of wyth oe any comprsone ben more to be dred feiy and worshipte than a|ny thing aboue seyd. They he  aftyr and that not wyth owte grete meelle. that the fegue of owre lordys body  on a crosse whiche fy|gure and crosse. erely is wonce ful deuowtly to be kyssyd and worsipte of the coent in remembra~e of oe lordys passyon was founde fresh ledyng and newe abowte the place of the gete wounde in the right syde and alsoo at the right foote. Trewly  the setensse of the chche.  let doe the same croe to the grownd  so yl good f daye they de lefte hyt  the  d the alle And for a mor wondy the staffe and she|w of th same  ware fondyn by the sa me pla So  a the bretheren came to ge dyr into the  gretly aonyd pon these thynges that .   takyn alle that were te with grete cion of herte ke discyply ys of oddys   ate in the chir sey|den wepyngly the  o . for to ge te owre lordys meree. Trewely this  brother atte y^e daye whiche was gode friday with the night folowi~g and the nexte day aftyr alle moste tyl the sonne sette.  in one state. Alsoo the  with trength of handys opynde hys mowth and  in hyt stys of dyuers spyys and 

or hys releuyng. but anone after he wente owte ageyne. what somme euer was putte in to hys mowthe as thaugh hys throte hadde ben stopped. Emplasters alsoo to his breste and armys they on de but alle was vayne They prickyd with neldys and scrapyd the solys of hys fete. but no thyng myght be perceyuyd in hym of a lyuys manne. saue a lityll rednes of chekys and a litil warmenes of body. The colowre of hys face oftyn tymes was chaunged to ashis and ageyne meruaylously the colowre of hys face was reynyd and welle shewyd Alsoo they made a grete horne to beblowyn there but no thyng hit botyd


 Howe he came ageyn to hym self on estur euyn abowte complen tyme Ca iiii
tHenne on the morowe that ys estur euyn and the same owre that the couent came to gedyr to the collacion and to complenne the briys of hys ye lyddys beganne firste a lytil to moue and so they semyd as they hadde ben sode in boylyng watyr And atte laste there came don fro hys yes on hys chekys a yelowe humour of wa|tyr in manere of terys. Thanne they that were wyth hym seyng thys. called anone for the brethe ren. supposyng that he shuld haue sone passed fro thys world. They sawe also a lytyl afore thys ty me hys lyppys a lytyl to moue with his chekys com pressyd as he had resceyued or swelowde su~ swete

thing fallyn in to hys mowth. And after that a flowyng owte of terys as hyt is seyd here before. Alsoo he was seyn often and many diuers tymys sykyng alow in his breste as a manne slepyng had wepte. And anone after as hit semyd he reuol|uyd certeyn wordys benethe in hys throte butte he myght not speke them owte saue onely in a voyce onethys audybille and noo thyng intelligibille. Sothely thanne hys spyrite beganne a lytyll and a lytill to comme ageyne and these wordys and voyce he first sownyd that might be vndyrstond. O sancta Maria O sancta Maria: And agayne O my lady sancta Maria O my lady sancta Ma ria I shalle seye tho wordys as I herde theym noo thyng addyng therto O he seyde my lady Sancta Maria. These wordes often tymys he rehersed. For what synne he seyde lese y soo grete ioye. And agayne he seyde my Lady Sancta Maria. when shalle I recouere so grete ioye that y lese nowe. These thynges and many other often tymes he re|hersed / yet as a man ware a slepe and hys yes euer closyd / the whiche I wote not of what grete ioye he sorowde and wepte hym selfe departyd fro Sothely aftyrward sodenly lyke as a man had a|waked fro a grete slepe. he lyfte vppe hys hed  fulbitterly beganne to wepe  with re~nyng terys sorofully sobbyd as wepyng doth and ioynyng his handys  fyngers to gedur reysid him self and sate vp Then he put downe his hed in his handys on his kneys And as he beganne afore ful lamen

tably to wayle and sorowe so sesyd not long ty|me aftyr Thanne one of his bretheren that was with hym askyd what causyd hym so sore to wepe and howe he felte hym selfe. Than he restid a litil while  at the laste softely seyde to hym wele wele and verely wele y was hedir to / but now euyl and verely euyl y am and fele my selfe And ageyne more grettur he wepte and sorowd than he dyd be fore And by cause that hit ys ouer longe and also as i~possible to remembre al thyng that he seyde tha~ and how mekil he wepte we leue noweand purpo se to drawe shortly to gedir thoes thi~gys whiche we herde hym telle of in gret tricion of herte and of mynde aftyrward that he was fully comme to hym selfe ageyne


 Howe he sought after his showis and how re|uerently he worshipt the crosse
lOthl amonge his lamentacions and sykynges that the had he asayde with gret strenght onys or twies or thries to opene his yes that were closid and atte last they opened Thanne he beganne with bothe his handys al abou te to secht aftyr his staffe that he lefte in the chirce And whanne hyt kowd not be fownde he seyd. Sechith here owre staffe and take owr sys by the piller and goe we ageyne in to the fermorye A fermorye among religious men is called a place or an howse ordende to kepe seke bretheren Thanne

hanne hit was seyde of some of his bretheren. be|hoolde brother nowe and see yow in the fermorye  set in your bedde and loe yowre staffe and showys byn here redy. Thanne he seyd O howe came we hedyr and whanne. were not we ryght nowe in the chirche to gedyr at matens. Thanne his bre|theren told hym that he had be there now ii dayes and to morowe wilbe estur daye And whanne he herd this. more grettyr he beganne to wepe and seydr. O shuld we not bretheren haue worshypte on good freday owre lordys crosse. And yet we haue not in comonne worshipte hit Thenne whenne he herd of his bretheren. that owre lordys crosse was worshipte the day before. and he might not be cause of sekenes. he seyde to hem. Aftyr that I came into the chirche y felte no disese But y praye yow that y may go to worshipe the crosse. Thanne ther was brought to hym a crosse of seluyr the whi|che reuerently he clyppyd to hym. and with cossis and terys watryd the fete of the crosse. and vnto the tedusnes of some stondyng by / he thankyd owr lord and redemer and the fadyr and the ho|ly gooste for innumerabulle benefetis. of the why che he rehersyd mony synglerly. For hym selfe and vnyuersally for al holy chirche. and also for al de|greys and condycyons of alle crystyn pepulle and more attente for hys enmyes. yef any there ware or for the enmyes of hys frendys he made meruail prayers and obsecracyons. And as y suppose xxx tymes or more he inclynde hys hede doone to the fete

of the crosse with terys and sobbyng that often ty+mes his voyce sesid of prayng Thoes wordys the whiche he made in his supplicacions ware so redy  prompte and also repletyd with grete reson  hye|nesse of witte that hit semyd rathir he redde hem thanne seyde hem. Ho is swete seyng steryd mony than that herd hym to weping and deuocyon and euer while we remembre them causyn vs to haue a grete inwarde cumpunctyon. and also loue  deuo+cyon to our lord to our bretheren and to alle men And of the grete humylyte and goodnes of oure redemer. he put betwene certen grete thingis at eue+ry synguler shorte prayer


 Howe he told to one of his bretheren that he lo|uyd famylyarly suche thingys as he had seyn vi
tHe mene while as the tyme requyryd. hit range to the collacyon and the bretheren the whiche had brought to him the crosse went thense And thenne he seyde. Nowe y knowe veryly that this is the holy tyme of estur. And for what cause he seyde so. hit shalbe declaryd aftyrward. Trewely than bode with hym a certeyn brother that louyd him famyliarly in holy purpose of relygyon and mouyd hym sum what by a wyse and a meke instans et beyng holde in a certeyn stupour and wo~+dyr of mynde of suche thinges that he had seyne. bothe of tho thinges the whiche befyll him afore ye he was rapte / and of tho thinges that he had seyn

spiritually in anothir world in al placis And as y haue seyde or may sey. synglerly  ticulay he tolde  remembrid mony thynges the whiche the forsid brother that herde him bare hem al in his herre. tel|ling him also of too thinges that he knewe opyniy betyd him And so aftirward bi leyser  gret dyly gens lernyd  knewe an ordir of euery thing syn|glerly. more opynner  fullyor than he knewe afo re. Neuertheles as for al thing that he sawe in soo longe space that is to seye ii dayes  ii nightys he wolde not telle to no man. And amonge in hys tellyng he made me~cyon of some sisyons but anon as he had begonne. sesid the ces of them And no thir et for any prayur might be inducyd to telle a|ny more ther of But nethir we at this tyme be suffi cient to telle al thinges the whiche sothely we knewe by his owne seyng that he had tolde before to afew sons of wytnesse on whois deuocyons he had ta|ken a specyalle truste Nethir in any wise we may or can reuele  shewe so opynly the prite of his sisio~s nether by writing nether by telling as he coude and didde Also amonge other thinges he was askid and he hoped to scape his seknes or shulde leue any leng in this bodely lyfe And then he seide I shal leue lo~g ynow  of my seknes y am fully recoueryd


 How he was desired of his bretheren to take su~ mete after so longe afaste  Ca vii
tHan after this at euyn he was gretly desired to take some mete after so longe a faste And

than he seyde Settith before s the bred  a litil ho|ny that was lefte the tothir tyme And whanne hit was so done with a ful litil refeccion ther of he bra ke his faste Ande so he bode waking in prayor and terys til the bowre of night that they range to ma|tens Sothely whan the bretheren rose to matens he went with hem and as he had rose with oure lorde the whiche sum tyme that same bowre rose fro deth vnto lyfe And so came to chirche. not withowte ioyful merueling of them that sawe him  without sustentation or helpe of any thing entrid into the o~re  so he did not a xi monthis before. And their in gret deuocyon  terys bode  tynewid til matens was doon  tyl the reurreccion of our lorde the whi che yerely in the same chirche is wont to be shewid vy sybly and howe the angel apperid and spake to the wemen at the septure of the victoriose isurreccion of ther kinge and also that they shulde tel to his dis|ciplys his glorious resurreccion  at the laste til our lord a peryd to his welbelouyd mary mawdelen and named her maria in the figure of a gardner and til the messys ware doone  had resceyuid the holy comyning of cristen men


 How he tolde to ii of his confessorys a parte of suche thinges as he had seyne Ca viii
after this nowe that he had resceyued oure lordys precyo body ioyful  light he was  brought of his bretheren i~to the colloke the which

ys a place where they may speke to geder and there copynily they came abowte hym desiring him to tel hem of sece thinges as befylle hym and as he had seyn forther goostly edifiyng  comfort For al they vndyrstode that herde his wordys the day before whe~ he was fully cumme to him selfe  sawe his conty|nuall weping that by mony thinges grete thingis and meruel had be shewde him. And whan they with grete instans askid him. he dissymylyd alle thing a lytyl while At the laste vnto his ii confesso rys to whom he was confest on shrethursoay as hit is seyd afore to hem bothe separatly. he told thees thynges the whiche here after be digestyd and wre ten with grete weping and syking the whiche sum tyme sesd him of his telling And sum thinges he told to hem bothe and sum thinges onely vnto the thoon / and sum othir: only to the tothir and that not without a consyderacion of a certen meke and a good auisement And this he gon to telle as hit nowe folowethe


 what was his peticion specially and how a certe~ person apperyd to him in his slepe  Ca ix
sOthely he seyde whan y was laborid as ye sawe me with greuys and longe wekenes of body and euermore with heite and sowle y bles|syd our lorde and thankid him that he wolde white safe to chaste me onworthy in a fadyrly chastme~t And than al hope put aside as for any recoueryng

of boly helth y began thaugh hit were slowly ne|uertheles y disposed me as y cowde and mighte to make me redy. how y might the sandyr and lygh ter scape the peyngs and sorows of the world that is to cu~me  how y might fynde the reste of euerla|styng life when y shuld be callid oute of my body. And when as y reme~brid these thi~ges after my po wer besely. than after a litil while past a thoughte fyl to my mynde that y shulde praye our lord god that he wolde white safe to reuele and shwe to me in some maner of wise. the state of the worlde that i to come  the icion of the soulys that byn past her bodyes after this lyfe and thanne this opynly knowen y might the bettyr vndirstonde what withi~ shorte space as y supposyd were to be dred.  what y might hope after whanne y shuld passe fro thys worlde to that worlde and so by this to stabylle my selfe in the drede  loue of god as long as I shuld leue in this dowtefulle lyfe. And so on a certeyn night in the begynnyng of lente that ys laste past. apperyd to me in my slepe a certe~ worshipful son sto~dyng by me  seyng to me. O sone he seyde gret ys thy deuocyo~ in praying  mekyl is thy perseueres wherfore thy contynual prayer and meke demening may not be onspedeful before the presens  goodnes of god Neuertheles fro hens forth be of goode con forte and tynew deuoutly in prayur and for more strenght seche the helpe of prayers of some religions pons.  ef yow so do doutles you shalte knowe y^t sone you shalte opteyne  gete thy peticion Sothely

than he named to me some persons  the namys of ther offices seyng this / Knowe wele that mekil yt wille the fete. ef yow maye haue the prayers of suche persons. the whiche the goodnes of god ys wonte right gladly to here. Sende also to the mo|nastery of nonnys here by. that yow knowyst wele  namyd hir / besechyng hem to praye for the. Me kyl god is pleasid in her holy purpose and lauda|ble conuersacion. wherfore his goodnes gretly fa|uerth their willes and desires And whan this was seyd to me. bothe the slepe that y was in  the son that spake to me went away. Than sodenly y wa|kyd and stedfastly kepte in mynde this vysyon.  assone as y might y desired the same persons to pray for me / not vttering to them the cause wherfore they shulde pray for me Than vi wekis passe. i~ the night that was nexte afore sherethursday as e can reme~|bre. whan y had taken of yow and of youre fe|lowe discyplynys in the chaptur hows. that ys to seye vi of yow  vi of him for that day. and v o|ther for the sexte feriis of lente paste. fro the whiche y was compellyd that tyme to absteyne by cause of sekenes so grete abundans of grace of terys  swe|tenesse of herte / y felte me repletyd there in the res|ceyuyng of tho discyplynys that y can not shewe it in telling by no wordys. wherfore the nexte day af ter hit was to me ful swete often tymes to wepe. And than the next nyght after grete sykynges be|yng than the houre to ryse to matens y fylle in to a plesaunt slepe

Lytyl yt ys y take god to recorde. and as no thyng what somme euer y be aboute to telle of the peynys and tormentys of that place. For in a ful schorte space of tyme by alle maner dyuersytees of an hondyrd|folde peynys and tormentys or more y behylde and sawe howe theywere consumed and wasted to noughte and thenne anone restoryd ageyne And ageyne almoste they were with peynys broughte to nought and a none made hole ageyne the whiche in that same place the loste lyfe of hem was compellyd to sofre. And of these alteracyons of tymes in the whyche by grete peynys and tormentys they were

brought to nought anone restoryd ageyne ther was non ende no marke ne terme. Also the hete and bren nyng of that fyre was so feruent and deuouring that what sum euer hyt brent hyt wulde be lyke as a thyng that ware al moste consumyd or wastyd. And thenne the worms that were there warded  brokyn and made smalle vnto pecys and then they were gedyrd on grete hepys to gedyr and leyde vn ther the vnhappy synful wrechys that were there. wherfore they so fulfylled alle thyng with so grete stenche that hyt excedyd alle the tormentys  peynis before seyd. And et remayneth one thyng the wy che they that were in that place were compellyd to sofre the whiche ys more hatfull peynful and scha meful than any thyng aboue seyde

sOthely alle thoo that were there ponyssht  peynde were in thys worlde whyle they leuyd doers of that foule synne the whiche oughte not be namyd not only of a crystyn man but also of none hethyn man. Certen grete monstrus that ys to seye grete bestys onnaturally schapyne schewyd hem selfe in a fyrye lykenesse horrabulle and gastfulle to sight and oftyn tymes vyolently came a pone hem and also in a fowle damnable abusion compellyd

I neuyr herde before nether hadde any suspycyon hethir to that the kynde of wemen hadde be deprauyd and defoyled by suche a foule synne. And alas for so rowe. for ther was founde a company of suche so innumerabulle as they were myserable. Many of tho personys that were there in that place y knewe not nethyr wele behylde hem by cause that the qualy te of her foule synne. and the grete stenche and tor mentys that was there smytte me wyth full grete horrour and tedusnes. Full greuys hyt was vnto me and more thanne a man may beleue to be there in that place a mome~t whyle. or to beholde suche

trewly thawgh y refusyd as mekyll as y myghte to see and beholde tho thm~ghes that were done yn that place y cowde not auoide the kno weleg of on clerk the wyche y sawe and knew sum tyme Thys clerk in hys days was a doct of lawe and also amonge other that were docturs of lawe he was had in that sciens ful excellent. Full many lerners of that faculte he orde~de yn scolez wherby he gatte to hym gret famyliarite of worshippeful men

This clerke was largely posseste with beneficys  rentys of the chirche and et that not withstonding dayly he coueytyd to haue more and more wher fore by the wille of god the whiche wolde haue alle men to be turne to pena~s. he felle yn to grete sekenes by the whcihe he was sore vexid and desesid abowt a. ix. monthys.

Thys forseyde clarke the whyche y knew su~ tyme in my chyldhode and yong aage. y vndyr|stode nor y knewe not that he was dysceste and ded. For that same tyme in the whyche y knewe hym he remouyd fro that prouynce or place ther as he was wonte to dwelle in before vnto a nothir p|uynce or place. Neuertelesse yn alle suche peynys  tormentys as hit ys aboue seyd y sawe  fownde

hym and y merueyled of hit For y had wente he had be yet a lyue and also an honest person Than y spake to hym and askyd whethyr he hopyd any tyme to haue the mercye of god And than he seyde Alas alas y knowe and knowe that athishalfe do|mys daye y schall haue algate no mercye And whe thir y schalle haue any thanne y am not certeyn So thely euermore sethe y was putte here to these peynys they encresyn more and more Then y seyde to hym And why were yow not confeste of thy synnys at thy laste ende  dydyst no penaunce for hem Than he seyde by cause y hopyd to haue recouered and al so by the disceyte of the deuyl my gostely ennemy y was aschamed to confesse so fowle a synne, leste y shulde haue be of les reputacyon and dyspysed a monge them the whiche y semyd gloryous  fayre y confeste me of lytyl and smale synys to seche an honest person and a worschipfull pryste that yow knowyst wele And whanne he askyd me ef y had any other thynges to be confeste of y bade him go his waye and tolde him that ef any other thyng cumme afterward to my mynde y woulde sende for hym ageyne and tell him. And whanne he was gonne and onethis came to his chirche y begunne to deye Thenne anone he was cald for ageyne and whenne he was cumme / he fownde me ded  go~ne Trewly ther ys no thyng of a thowsand peynys that y sofyr dayly so greuys to me as ys the vnhap py presentacion of my fowle and vnclene leuyng that y yd in the world and now beyng here am

compellyd to doo actually the same foule passyon. And besyde the horrabulle gretnesse of peynys that y am in. y am more confounded of schame whyle dat y am by the same synne made cursyd and ab|homynable in the syght of al men. Alas alas who euer wolde haue wende that the worschyppe and fa|uour the whiche y hadde amonge men sculde be tur|ned to seche confusyon and despeion as it is nowe wherfore ful gretely y am confowndyd and assha med. for nowe to euery creature y appere foule and abhomynable. the whiche before apperyd to euery man gloryous and honorabulle. And thys he seyd with full sore and grete cryyng and we|pyng And whyle y meruelde the wrechidnes and peynys of so grete a man sum tyme. y sawe howe he was ponysshte in innumerabulle wysys. and by two tormentys he was brought as to nought and dyssoluyd by strenthe and here of fyre and so ma de lyquyd as ledys whenne hyt ys multe. Sothely thanne y askyd sent Nycholas my leder yf this ma~ nys peynys myght be remedyde or helpe by any me|ne. And thanne he seyde whanne the daye of dome ys cumme thenne  crystys wille be fulfylle d He onely knowyth the hertys of alle men And then he wole doo to euery man ryghtfully. Therfore I coude knowe no thyng for certen of this ma~nys de lyberacyon. Therfore thoo thyngys the whiche we haue spokyn of here before may wele be consyderyd as the scripture seyth in thys wyse. Non est ei bene qui assiduus est in malis  elemosmam non danti.

that ys to saye hyt ys not wele with hym that ys be sye in euyll Nethir with hym that dothe non almys See nowe and consydre howe gretely they be holpe in placys of peynys by the doyng of almys dedys. as oure lorde spekyth in the gospelle the whiche dyd hem in her lyfe. Thys clerke in hys lyfe was wise and wyttye in hys owne conceyte and trusting to him selfe set ful lytyl to seche helpe of other by almis dede and good werkys for his synnys. that hathe wrought nowe to hym damnacyon. Loo so sone and sodenly he ys founde onwyse and madde. Con ceyne nowe what ys here nowe seyde of thys clarke and a lytyl before what was seyde of a goldsmyth and opynly hyt confermethe the sentence of the scryp ture seyng in thys wyse Potenter potentes tormen|ta sustinebunt  exiguo conceditur misericordia. y^t ys to seye. Myghty men myghtyly schalle sofyr tormentys. and to a meke man ys graunted mer cye. That goldsmyth and though he were a syner et was in hys owne syghte meke and lytyl the whi che nethir by hys connyng nerhyr of any othir ver tue presumyd but countyd hym selfe euermore on wyse and onstable by cause of hys synnys Therfo re by the mene of almys dedys. and serues as he myght doo. gate to hym the helpe and soffragys of hys grete and myghty aduocatour and patro~ seynt Nycholas and so in tyme of nede he had elpe and mercy as he desyred And also euyn contra|rye wyse thys clarke of the excellente connyng ry|ches and worschippe that he hadde cedyd forthe

hys wekednesse. And by cause he thoughte hym selfe excepte in this worlde. fro the comon labur of men. Lo in so cruell and byttur example he is not nowe ponysshte with othyr men. Also y sawe there hys tonge hauyng forthe oute of his hede and be syly brennyng as hyt were abronde of fyre and y^t veryly he sofryd by cause that often tymes he per|ted ryghtwesnes as a man myghty in wordys ta|kyng eftys and mennys persons. For he vsyd not only to iangyl idyle wordys. but also froward ly in wordys contrarye to wrothe ouer mekyl he had excedyd. Therfore no meruelle though he were po nyshte this wyse for suche excessys and fawtys. whenne oure lorde spekyth in the gospelle of the ryche man the whiche for hys light speking and iange|lyng at mete was sore ponyshte in hys tonge in a flame of fyre. Sorthely after this came to me that worschyppefull pryste to home this clerke was con|feste of hys smale synnys as hit ys rehersed before And amonge other thyngys the whyche this wor|schipful pryste herde of me y tolde howe this clarke afore seyde whenne he was confeste bade hym goo hys waye as for that tyme. and so anone dyde as hyt ys seyde before And when y had told him this he wepte ful bytturly and toke god to recorde that hit was very trouthe as y seyde and knewe wele. that the forseyde clerke seyde so to hym Therfore on ly of that multytude of wrechys y knewe this clerke that this seyde to me

sOthely thanne sone after that we were paste thys third place we came to a regyon whe|re the soulys the whiche hadd done her purgacyon in purgatorye ioyfully restyd. in the whyche place many y knewe wele and founde hem there in grete felycyte and conforte. Trewely as touchyng the ioys of that place and the ocundnes and gladnes of them that were there as oure lorde wylle eue vs grace we schall afterward schewe and declare. but fyrst lete vs turne ageyne thys narracyon to thoes thynges the whyche we haue lefte oute of the pey|nys and merytys of some personys in especyalle. the whyche y sawe and founde in tho placys of purga torye as hyt ys seyde before


 Of. ii. personys that this monke sawe  spake with in the first place of purgatorye and first w^t a prior  Ca xxvii
tHerfore a prior that was father of a relygy ous place the whiche y knewe full wele sum tyme dyscee and deyde this same yere. And of hys maners and condycyons y knewe many thyn|gys the whiche y leue oute at this tyme by cause of schortenes. Thys man and prior y sawe and knew amonge the firste that were in peynys of the fyrste place of purgatorye that we came to. Trewly he was in ful grete and sore tormentys and sofryd ful greuys peynys. sum tyme in fyre and sum ty|me in stinkyng bathys of brimston  pyche medild

to gedyr hoys face and there was ouer wrechyd  dedful And assone as he sawe me he began meke|ly to calle me and grete me whome with compas|syon of herte y grete also and spake to hym many thyngys. And y enquyryd of hym whethir he so freyd so grete peynys for the fawtys the whiche he dyd in youthe by cause perauenture he neglygently kepte hys ordre that he toke to hym in hys chyldho de And he seyde naye But neuertheles ful sore and byttyr peynys y sofre here not onely for myne owne synnys and excessys the whiche y dyd in myne own person howe be yt that y offendyth in many thingys but also for the wekydnes and mysgouernaunce of tho personys the whiche a lytyl before y had char ge and cure of. For as touchyng myne own syn nys y wulde sofyr as y myght bere / thoes peynys the whyche be dewe for hem. For y vsyd to redeme and schast myne owne synnys by ofte confessyon and takyng discyplynys and besy prayers And al so by dyuers other weyes. Sothely of these thingis ful sore greuyth me nowe the carnal affeccyon and loue that y hadde to my frendys. as fadyr  mo|ther and other of my kynne of the whyche to sum of hem y gate benefycys of chyrchys. whenne they we re ful onworthy to haue hem  toothir y gaue right ondyscretely many eftys of the godys of the mo|nasterye that y was prior of and they nowe ful ly|tyl remembre me or doo any thynge for me in my nede. Trewlye the fauyr of pepulle  the loue of worschippe that y had me prinspaly noythe And

alas alas for sorowe. for and god take not mer cy on me as y am nowe in peynys oute of mesure. so schalle y be withoute ende. The couetyse ambycy on that y hadde to kepe my worschippe. and the fe re that y hadde to leue hit. so blyndyd the syghte of my soule that y lowsyd the brydyl of correccyon to the willys of my sogettys  sofryd hem to doo  folowe her desyrys  lustys as my yes had be clo|syd. leste haply ef y had correcte hem  refraynde hem from her lyghtnes they wulle haue be to me as enemyes to labure and to haue me out of my wor schippe and prelacyon that y was in. Forthermore they that were gode relygyous men and had zele and loue to kepe the ordyr. y no thing helpyd or faueryd in conseruacyon of the relygyon. but full inordenatly and contrary to vertue y wolde wyth other that loued hem not speke euyl of hem and de tracte hem and cherysshe other that were ful euyl di sposyd and brekerys of her holy fessyon and or|der And alle this y dyd a part of myne owne light nes and a parte be cause y wolde defende my prela|cyon And for hem to pleye lewde gamys  to speke and clathyr tryfullys iapys and other lewdnesse and also to goo and wandyr amonge secler fol|kys in ydelnes. hyt was leful to hem. as hyt was to me. Therfore some of hem by thys cruel lyght|nes of me and that they sawe in me presumyd and sayde to do many full cursyd thyngys. wherfore here y am ponysshte withoute hoe. howe be yt that y approuyd not her wykyd dedys Notwithsto~ding

y knewe hem. and of a vayne drede. made lyke as yf y had not knowe hyt. wherfore many of hem bo de stylle in her fowle abusyons. going fro euyll to wars. And some of hem contynued in euyll vnto her dethe whyle y leuyd in the worlde. and now they be euerlasting dampde. Also some other of hem et hethir to leuyn contynualy wars and wars in grete synnys and dedly dedys. wherfore to hem and to me as y am agaste succedyth inextynguyble fyre. Also fro the howre that y paste fro my body. y ame putte to onspekehabule tormentys the whiche were as me semyth nowe ful lyght in comparyson of the peynys that y nowe sofyr. Sothely the firste daye after my dethe was to me more eser thanne alle the dayes that y hadde setthe And of alle the synnys  fautes that nowe they done after my dethe of an e|uyl custome that they hadde before the whiche they be seyne to haue take by my neglygens. my peynys therfore ben euermore encresyd And by cause that y knewe sum of hem that be ded and sum other the whiche ette leuyn. that haue flyd and falle besyde other synnys. to that fowle and abhomynable syn ne that ought not to be named and therfore putte to hem no correccyon. no thyng y drede so mekyll. as the encresyng of my peynys so largely tyl y be co~ pellyd to sofyr the foule and abhomynable stenche the whiche they sofre and haue nowe the whiche dyd the same fowle and abhomynable synne for y know wele that the greuys peyne of that same stenche ys more intollerable  peynfull than any other peynys

Also he tolde me what daye what place and what tyme after that he was paste oute of thys world and what person of hym hyt was and what synne he hadde done. And he told my many thyngys that they dyde and seyde anone as they done any euyl the whiche y had sum tyme cu re of the mynystrys and wykyd angellys of the deuylle vpbraydyn me with the same and anon they encresyn my peynys Sothely ther was sum of the bre theren of that place the whiche this man aforeseyde was prior and father to that were accendyd by e le of rightwysnes and feruor of relygyon and dyd also grete labur and dylygens that alle inordinate fauors putte a syde the puryte and honeste of her or dre myght be kepte And this y knewe was trouthe wherfore y seyde to hym. Howe than was hit noy|syd fer and brode that many thyngys were wel re formyd and amendyd before your ende in the pla ce where ye were prior yf hit be nowe schewyd yow so mekyl euyl of hem that dwelle there ette.

Trewly her condycyons were so froward  obsty nate that vtwardly y hadde wende they had be incor rygyble  what sum euer ys beleuyd to be done ther fore amendment. but yf the meruaylous power  myght of god helpe. hyt wyl be broughte done a|geyne to noughte Alas alas why dyd y beleue eu~ to seche consels. Alas that euer y fauyrde and mag nyfyde feche persons by the whiche y dyd so offende the mageste of god so to let hem haue her wylle to doo what they wolde. Sothely foure persons there byn  tolde me her namys that y schuld seye to he~. but yf they sone do to god. euynworthy penaunce for her cursyd dedys  consels. by the whiche they haue loste hem selfe  other also the whiche haue do ne after hem they schalle haue the indycyble  euerla styng tormentys of helle And trewly yf they dyd penauns  satisfaccion tyl domys daye they schulde thynke hit but lytyl in to the recompensacyon  ex|pyacyon of the grete and longe schrewdenes and cursydnes by the whiche they haue broughte me to this peynys that y am in nowe and with her wyc|kydnes they haue al moste enfecte  cu~brid alle the howse.
