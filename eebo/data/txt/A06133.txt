CHOYCE
OF
IEVVELS. By Lodowik Lloid Esquier.

Printed by Thomas Purfoot.
1607.





T Tepsichore comes with Clio in hand, to iudge with graces three,
O Of one such like Lucina sayd, the Sunne did seldome see.


A As she that suckt Mellissaes milke, fed on Sibillas brest,
N Nurst with sweet Ambrosias meat, with heuenly Nectar drest.
N Now comes Vrania on message sent, from states of greatest fame,
A Aurora like descends from skie to enrowle on earth her name.


Q Queene Pallas sayd, her name in Court should be Panophia stal'd,
V Venus smiling wisht her name, might be Panphila cal'd.
E Euer Iuno sadly sayd, her name must Pandora be,
E Each Nymph, each Muse, each grace agreed, Pandora should be she.
N Now sits shee on Mynerua seat, where all Cytherides gree,
E Euterpe shold to Cynthia say, crowne this Queen with Crownes three.


O On forth Eudora said, and send Medeas golden fleece,
F Fates all agreed Palladium should, to Britane come from Greece.


G Great thrice gracious grac't shee is, where graces three do tend,
R Right happie thrice  thrice Queen, where kingdom three do bend.
E Erato charged Iris streight on knee to Euriia bend,
T That soone Euribia from Samos should, her crowne and scepter send.


B Bellona arm'd with sword and shield: Eumenides stands in place,
R Rhamnusia shall reuenge on those, that seeks this Queenes disgrace
I In strength from Delos Diana comes with bowe and quiuer bend.
T The Troiane Ladies from Ida did, the goulden apple send.
A Amarusia comes with Peplon on, her chore Calliope als,
N Now Daphnes comes with lawrell crownes to crowne her Ladies all.


H Her bowers the Dryads build vp braue, and these the Oreads decke,
E Each Nymph with flowers  poesies sweet attend Pandoras check.
A Arabin Ladies with Saba came, with myrth and Cassia sweet,
L Like Libanon all these Ladies smell, which comes our Queen to greet.
T Triton sound the Trumpet out, make worlds her fam to know,
H Heauens haue their starres of states, some such on earth be so.




TO THE MOST NO|ble
and vertuous Queene Anne, by
the grace of God, Queene of Great Britaine,
Fraunce, and Ireland, c.
_LEa and Rachel, (most Noble
Queene) left and forsooke
their Countrey Mesopotamia,
to come to Israell, to bee the
mother of the twelue Tribes
of Israell Ruth the Moabite,
came from Moab to Iudah, to
be the mother of many great
and godly Kings in Iudah. Your Maiestie descen|ding
from many Kings and Princes, came from Den|marke
to Scotland, from Scotland to England, to be the
mother of many Kings and Princes, in great Britane.
Thus wee are bound to the prouidence of God,
by whom Kings do raigne, and Kingdomes are sup|ported,
and that by Gods good and gracious means
in women, as by Thermus Pharoes daughter to saue
Moses in Nylus; to bring the Children of Israell out
of Egipt, by King Tharbus daughter of Ethiop; to yeild
the Citie Saba, and thereby the victorie to the He|brew
Armie; thus heathen women by God are ap|pointed
to serue Israell at neede.
How much more is Esher famous for her great vi|ctory
ouer the Persians. Iudith by cutting off Holofer|nus
head was in Bethulia both for euer famous: noble
stratagems of women. But your Maiestie by putting

your Highnes helping hand to pare their feet lesser,
their eares shorter, their eyes out, and their mon|strous
heads off, that can come and goe, that can see
and heare from Rome, from Rhemes, from Spaine to
Great Britaine, such victories shold haue double try|umphes,
the one in earth, the other in heauen.
Whe~ Rachels Image was buried by Syche~, Israel be|gan
to flourish; then Debora a woman within a while
after became a Iudge in Israel for 40 yeres in mount
Ephraim: when Maachas idoll Priapus, was buried and
ashes throwne to Caedron, then Iudah prospered, and
Hulda a woman dwelling in Hierusalem, to whome
Iosias sent to know how to serue the Lord, and to be
instructed by a woman, to purifie Iudah from Images
and Idols.
God raised wise, godly and vertuous women in all
countreys to feare him,  to feed his seruants; a wo|man
in Sarepta to feed Elias, a Sanamite woman to
lodge Elizeus, to a woman of Samaria Christ asked
drinke,  confessed himselfe to be the Messias.
Since Christ was so conuersant with wome~, that to
women Christ spake his last speach before his death,
 after his death he first appeared to women, I wish
some women should haue Christ in their hearts in
Great Britane, as Anna had in her armes in Hieru|salem,
to pray to him and not to Saints, to worship
Christ in the Church, and not Idols and Images in
Closets and Galleries: then did Iudah prosper, then
did Israell florish, and then shall Great Britane bee
happie.
Your Maiesties most bounden and dutifull seruant.
LODOVVIK LLOID.



To the most noble and vertuous
Prince Christianus King of Denmarke, c. Lodowik
Lloids most humble Gratulation at his
comming to great Britane.
_WHo can passe in silence (most noble Prince)
the ioyes and triumphes of these Halcyons
dayes, wherein Christianus King of Den|marke,
leauing his Kingdome, his Queen,
his Court, forsaking his imperiall Sceptor
and his Subiects, renouncing all princely
dignities, as a Prince that had his soule diuided betweene
Great Britane and Denmarke, esteeming more the one
halfe in Britane, than the whole in Denmarke.
O loue! excelling all loue, and that in a King, which the
heauens cannot subdue, the earth forget, nor fortune ouer|throwe;
of whose eternall fame, fame dare not lye.
Let Maro cease to commend his Troiane Aeneas: let
Homer blush to aduance the greatnesse of Achilles, which
disguised himselfe like a woman, lest hee should goe from
Greece to Phrygia. Let Greece not name Vlisses to faine
madnesse, lest he should depart from Ithaca, and his wife
Penelope to Ilion.
But Christianus King of Denmarke, whom neither mo|ther,
Queen, Crownes, or Kingdome, could keepe him from
great Britan: where his Maiestie may of right more reioyce
of his princely Progenie, than King Philip of Hercules
stocke in Macedonia, or Augustus Caesar of gens Iulia in
Rome, sith the line of Hercules expired in Alexander,
and the stemme of Aeneas in the Emperour Nero, so that
Romanes now may say, Fuimus Troes; and Macedoni|ans
say, Fuimus Herculani.
But Great Britane was then neuer so great vnder
Brutus the first King, as nowe vnder Iames the second

King, whose continuance well nye three thousand yeres,
is now againe like the Eagle renewed and reuiued, to be by
Gods goodnesse continued as long by the second Brutus,
that babes in cradles may say, Iubilate Britanni.
Much beholden we are to God, if we forget not God, and
great cause haue we to loue, and to honour his Highnesse in
great Britane: if we looke but vnto the greatnesse of his
loue to England in Queen Elizabeths time, and now with
greater at this present to King Iames, if we shuld be deafe,
and not heare of it, or be dumbe, and not speak of it, heauen
and earth would accuse vs of too much ingratitude, wood
and stones should condemne vs of too much forgetfulnesse.
Sith neither Syracusa, with their conuoyes and proui|sion
to the Romanes at Thrasymenum, neither Tyre
nor Sydon, with their Caedars of Lybanon to Ierusalem,
were so forward as Denmark was of late to England; but
as Masinissa sayd of the Romanes, that there was one kind
of people vpon the earth, the people of Rome, and among
that one people one Scipio, to whom he fully deuoted him|selfe,
as one whose soule rested in Scipioes bodie: the like
sayd Hyra King of Tyre, of Salomon King of Israel.
But neither Hyra with his Sydonians, was more grate|ful
to Salomon King of Israel, nor Masinissa with his Nu|midians
more louing to Scipio the Romane Consul, than
Christianus King of Denmarke, was to Iames King of
great Britane, whom neither heauens, earth, nor seas, nei|ther
Kingdomes nor Court, could keepe that louing King
from his loue, to come from Denmark as a crowned starre
of the North, to shine in England, and to come to celebrate
and to renew the name of great Britane, to see the Queene
his Sister, his Nephew, and the rest of the Kings children,
the sound and sacred anchor of three Kingdomes.

O loue immortall! not to be wayed in ballance, not with
measure to be measured, not knitted with Gordius knot to
be cut by Alexanders sword, neither with Hercules knot to be vnknitted by Phoebus, sith all prophane Histories
cannot allow but eight onely of the like loue, but not eight
Kings, most seldome two. For to see a King out of his king|dome,
is as strange, as to see the Sunne out of the skie.
Let England bee of equall loue with Denmarke, sith
loue is recompensed with loue, iustly weyed in equall bal|lance,
not with Philips siluer swords in Greece, not with
Artaxerxes golden Archers in Persia, but with Pytha|goras
weapons, one minde, one heart, and one soule, per|petuall
weapons, the triumphes thereof haue their euerla|sting
tropheis.
Among such, what needs such leagues, and couenants
to dippe our weapons in blood, as the Scythians did? or die
our clothes in blood, as the Armenians did? or to drinke
blood out of our armes, as the Medians and Lydians did?
Sith the league between great Britane and Denmarke
is consecrated with inward blood of mutuall hearts, and
confirmed with the entrals and bowels of naturall Parents,
that two Sunnes may be sooner found to agree in the skie,
than these two Kings to disagree on earth.
This God hath appointed, nature confirmed, fates al|lowed,
and fortune thereto agreed.
Hence grow the cause of our publicke Iubilies, and crow|ned
feasts, our dayly tropheis, and perpetuall triumphes;
that as the Romans loued and agreed with the Sabins, yeel|ding
thanks to their God in the Feast Consualia: so the
Britanes with the Danes, yeelding thanks to their
God Iehouah in their Feasts Scaenopegia.





The Choyse of Iewels.
_THE Empire of Women,
and Courts of Queenes,
euen fro~ Semiramis time,
haue gouerned countries
and kingdomes, subdued
Realmes ruled States, and
brought vnder their o|beysance
both Kings and
kingdomes;Asia buil|ded by a wo|man of that name. as also before Semiramis time it may
eee probable, for that Asia the greatest part
of the world was named Asia by a Queene of
that name which then dwelt in Asi, whose fame
continued vntill Semiramis the second Empresse,Semirais the second Empresse of Asia.
whose martiall exploytes and gouernment hath
been such (if authorities may serue) as neither
Alexander the great could exceede in magnani|mitie,
nor Cyrus in victories, nor Xerxes in mul|titude
of souldiers.

Wee leaue the Court of Sardanapalus King of
Assiria, who during his life, exceeded in all effe|minate
wanto~nesse, hauing his Court full of such
Iewels, as he was wont to it amongst them in
womans apparell, among such light and shame|lesse
women where women were in mens appa|rell,
and men in womens apparell, of which I will
omit to speake; But I will begin with those wo|men
that were speciall Iewels appointed not on|ly
to saue his people, but to saue kingdomes and
countryes, not only among christins, but among
Heathens and Pagans.
DEBORA,DEBORA a Iudge in Isarell. a woman which dwelt in Mount
Ephraim, and iudged Israel fourty yeares, vanqui|shed
the Chananites, and slue Sisera.
HVLDAH,HVLDAH a Prophe|tesse in Ie|rusalem, a Prophetesse which dwelt in Ie|rusalem,
to whome king Isia after the law booke
was found, sent for Councell to know how and
what way God might be pleased with Israell.
Who knoweth not, but Rebecca by God ap|poynted,
councelled her sonne Iacob to flee from
his brother Esau to Msopotamia, where God ap|poynted
such two Iewels for him, as made him
the father of the 12 Tribes of Israell, in whome
he and his posteritie was blessed by the seede of
LEA, a woman?
IOSEPH,IOSEPH  to E|gipt by his brethren. a man sent by God to Egipt, (though
sold by his brethren) where the like Iewell was
appoynted him, to weete Assanetha an Egiptian,
the mother of Manasses and Ephraim, two adop|ted

Tribes in Israell, by whome (during Iosephs
life) the Hebrews were Lords of the land of
Goshen, and free from their bondage in Egipt.
Was not THERMVTIS the Kings daugh|ter
of Egipt,THERMV|TIS the daughter of Pharo K. of Egipt. a Iewell appointed to saue Moses from
drowning in Nilus, to name him Moses, to bring
him vpp as her sonne adoptiue to possesse the
Crowne in spight of their Priests of Memphis?
ESTHER an Hebrew maide,ESTER rare and zeale for the Iewes. maried to Aa|shuerosh
the great King of Persia, a Iewell of God
not only appointed to saue Mrdocheus her vnc|kle,
but all the Iewes her country-men within an
hundred seauen and twenty Prouinces, with the
daunger of her owne life, and the destruction of
Seauenty and fiue thousand Persins, and the han|ging
of Hman, and his ten sonnes.
In Bethulia a woman widdow ventured more
then any man,The bold and rare at|tempt of Iu|dith a wo|man. either Cyrus, Alexander, Or Caesar
in their owne persons, as shee did who brought
Holofer head in a bagge through the Assirian
campe to , whereby the whole Assirian
army was ouerthrowne. A famous victorie for
a woman to be recorded for the fame of women.
Obserue therefore, how God chiefly by wo|men,
in all countries saued and defended his peo|ple:
In Mesopotamia, by Labans daughters, Lea
Rachell. In Egipt, by THERMVTIS King Pharoes
daughter. In Ethiopia, by Tharbis the King of E|thiops
daughter, whom Moses maried and made
her a christian, whome Pharaoh and the Priests of

Egipt gaue him to th' end to slay him; as Saul sent
Dauid to the Philistians for the like purpose. In
Persia by ESTHER King Ahashuerosh wife. In Be|thulia
by Iudith a widdow, these were peculier
women by God appoynted.
What should wee seeke proofes far off, when
we haue examples at home. Had we not in Eng|land,England, Scotland,  Fraunce, combined by women. such a Iewell as combined Fraunce vnto Eng|land?
And another Iewell that brought Scotland
vnto England, being two women?
Had we not such a Iewell of a woman in Eng|land,
after tenne terrible battels wherein there
were a Hundred Knights and Barons slayne,
tenne Princes and Dukes destroyed, and one
Hundred thousand Englishmen slayne in the
field between the houses of Lancaster and Yorke,
a woman being the onely cause of a perpetuall
League betweene both houses? And euen at
this present wee enioye such a Iewell, that will
blesse Brittane, both with Tribes and Kings, as
Lea and Ruth did Israell.
This onely shall suffice,Kingdomes  Realmes, combined in a League by women. that kingdomes and
Realmes are combined and ioyned together in
perpetuall League of amity by women general|ly.
And sithence in the seed of a woman all the
people of God are blessed, I neede not to name
the virgin Mary, whose wombe was blessed that
bare him, and her paps that gaue him sucke; Nor
make mencion of such women long before Ma|ry,
of whome lineally Christ descended. as Lea,

and Racheli the wiues of Iacob, the mother of the
Tribes of Israell, of whome the Lyon of ludah,
and the starre of Iacob descended,Ruth the Moabite. Ruth the Mo|abite
the wife of Booz, the mother of Obed, the fa|ther
of sai, the father of Dauid, of whome came
the Kng of Kings.
How much more then were godly and vertu|ous
women blessed by Angells, by Prophets
magnified, and by Kings and Princes reuere~ced?
Iae the wife of Aber the Kenite shalbe blessed
sayd the Angell,Ial that slue Sisera. for shee slue Sisera King Iabins
Generall; And the victory of Israell was obtai|ned
by a woman, as DEBORA sayd to the fame
of women: Did not Osias the Gouernor of Bethu|lia
and of the army of Israell,The prayse of Iudith. blesse Iudith? And
so Achior blessed her, saying blessed art thou of
thy God in all the Tabernacles of Iacob.
Tugloria lerusalem, Tulaetitia Israell.
Asmuch and more might be spoken of Queene
Ester.
But to speake in particular of women, it were
infinite. I shoud but weary the Reader to runne
throughout the old and new Testament, with
the due prayse and commendacions of such Iew|els
as are fit to attend in Courts of Princes: As
of the woman of Bahurim by hiding Dauids ser|uants,The woman of Bahu|rim co~men|ded. shee saued their liues from Absalon, who
made search to destroy the King his father; shee
onely thereby saued her selfe, the Citie, and all
the Citizens.

So RAHAB in Iericho hid the Messengers of
Ioshua,RAHAB the like wo|man in Ieri|cho. whereby she saued not onely them, but al|so
her selfe, her family, and all the friends that s called
to her house, at the destruction of Iericho.
The Sunamites wife for her pitie  compassi
of the Prophet Elizeus, to make him a cham
in the house, to feed him being the man of Go
The Widdow of Sarepta entertained 
with all the wealth she had,The widdow of Sarepta. which was a handfull
of flowre, a little cruise full of Oyle. See a wo|man
was appointed to feed Elias;  a woman to
make a chamber to welcome Elizeus in.
Such Iewels are to be entertained in Courts of
Kings who are alwaies readie for good and god|ly
suits; and not with Moloch his reaching hand,Moloch.
and his Caemorims Priests; nor with Iudas with o|pen
hands to take what they will.
Againe to speake of wise and discreet wo|men,The praise of wise wo|men.
who could be wiser than ABIGAIL Na|bals
wife, who by her wisedome so intreated Da|uid,
that she saued her husbands life, and after be|came
Queene in Israell, euen king Dauids wife?
The woman of Abella, who with her wise|dome
councelled with the chiefe Magistrates of
Abella,Sebaes head the Traytor. and brought Sebaes head the Traitor, and
threw it ouer the wall to Ioab; when neither Ioab
offered peace, nor the Magistrates of Abella
sought peace, yet she saued the Towne, and the
Armie of Israel from much slaughter.
I will therefore conclude with an Epilogue of

the new Testament, of women that farre excel|led
men in faith, in constancie, and in seruice of
the Lord.Women more zea|lous than men. I will omit to speake of Marie Magda|len,
Ioanna the wife of Chusa, Herods Steward, of
Susanna, with many other such women, which
ministred to the Lord, as he trauailed to preach.
I need not make mention of Anna, who prophe|sied
of Christ to the people, receiuing Christ in
her armes at Ierusalem, confessed (as Simeon did)
the redemption of Israel; but euen of Pilates wife,
whe~ all men cried,Pilates wife Crucifige, to crucifie Christ, yet
this only woma~ endeuored to perswade her hus|band
Pilate, to wash his hands fro~ such a wicked
fact, affirming he was a just and a godly man.
I sieldome read of such faith in a man, as of
the woman, who desired but to touch the hem
of Christs garment, and to be healed thereby, as
she confessed, to whom Christ said, her faith had
made her whole.
Now hauing heard, that as women ministred
vnto Christ in his preaching, so women follow|ed
him to his death, and also attended him to his
graue;More wo|men followed Christ, than men. and more women were at Christs death,
than men; and as it seemed wept more bitterly,
than those fewe men that were there.
No doubt Iohn the Euangelist wept, Ioseph
of Arymathia, and Nichodemus wept and a few o|thers
wept, of whose weeping Christ took no no|tice;
but to the women who were many  wept
much, the Lord spake, saying, why weepe ye for me,

yee daughters of Syon? with much compassion he
pittied the women, who much lamented his
death;Christ first appeared to women after his resur|rect on. and after his death, Christ first appeared to
women, when the Apostles fled, forsooke, and
denyed him.
I know most men doubted of Christ his resur|rection,
yea the Apostles, whome the Lord re|prehended
for their incredulity, because they
would not beleeue Mary Magdalen to whome
the Lord first appeared;The Apo|stles re|dulous of the resurrection of Christ. neither would the Apo|stles
beleeue the other women, whome the An|gell
sent to tell them that the Lord was risen, and
went before them into Gallie.
Marke how the Lord spake to women his last
words at his death,Christ ap|peared twise to women after his death, before he appeared to his Apo|stles. and likewise appeared twice
to women after his death, before he appeared to
his Apostles.
If you reade prophane histories, you shall find
Asia first christened by a woman so named. And
Europe by the name of a woman called Europe
Agenors daughter King of Phaenicia. Scithia of
a woman that sprang out of the earth, and named
her sonne Scytha.The Ro|mans brag of Rhea. The Romans might better
brag of Rhea a woman, a vestall virgin well know|en,
(the Mother of Romulus) than of Rom
whose Father was not knowen; or of a farr
more ancient woman named Roma.
The Greeks might better bragge of Helena 
woman,The Greeks named of Helena a woman, ra|rather than of Hellas a man and not as they would haue it of Hellas 
man; Helena made Greeks then vnknowen, to be

knowne; she was the woman that was the whet|stone
of Greece, by this woman the Greekes be|came
first famous. But we leaue Asia, Europe, Phry|gia,
Greece, Scythia, and Rome; if we omit the fame
of women in these, what should I recite Prouin|ces
and Isles, Cities and Townes named after the
name of women? as Rhodes, Corcyra, Salamina, Ae|gina,Many Isles named after the name women.
 of many more which Diodorus writes of,
to whome I referre you.
And as the most part of the earth is Christened
and named by women, so also the most part of the
starres are constellated with women, not onely
with the names of women, but with the forme,
shape, and figure of women, of which I wish
you conferre with that Astronomer Astratus,
who filled the starres of women:The most part of the starres are figured by the names of women. considering
there be but a thousand and twenty starres names
knowne, I thinke the most part are figured and
named after the names of women.
I would haue a good Scholler to answere me,
that neuer loued a woman, That is not true, sith
the forme and jmage of Iustice is formed like a
woman with a sword in her hand; Prudence with
a glasse in her hand; Temperance with a dyall in
her hand; Fortitude with a great huge Colossus on
her shoulder, that Hercules could not stirre her.
And all these are wrought in gold, in siluer, in Ar|ras,
and in all kinde of Tapestrie.
The Queens of the Amazones courts were
onely of women, without men, where men by

Law and decrees made, might not gouerne or
beare rule, but were exercised in seruile works,The queens of Ama|zons, and their ex|ployts.
hauing their legges and armes made so weake by
their Nurces, that they could not beare armor,
as Diodorus writes, Quoinutiles fierent bello. This
was a pollicy of the Amazones, to be carefull to
keepe the anncient Lawe of Scithia, that men
should not gouerne them; who vsed to cut off
the right pappe of euery female kinde, because
it should not hinder them in their shot and mili|tary
seruice.
An example of two or three; Myrina one of
their Queens with thirty thousand foot women,Myrinaes marshall acts  vic|ries.
and two thousand horse, being armed with skins
of great Serpents, after that shee had subdued
many Regions and confines, euen vnto Libia,
marched vnto Egipt, at what time Orus, Isis sonne
reigned King there (so auncient a History it is)
with whom shee co~sented to a eague of peace.
Thence she marched into , whome she
much wased and spoyled; from thence to Syria,
whome shee conquered with much slaughter.
Thence shee marched to Mount  and o|uer
came the nations there about, so that Queen
Myra was as famous in Sythia, as was Semira|nus
in Asia; and both were as famous as Alex|ander
or Cyrus.
In like sort may it be spoken of Queene Medu|sa,Queene Medusaes warlike acts
and of her Court, as we did of Queene Myri|na,
that shee likewise gouerned a Nation of war|like

women named Gorgons, who feared not to
encounter with great King Perseus, the most fa|mous
and warlike King of his time amongst the
Graecians, and kept him long and hard in twoo
great battles.
The fame of these Queens grew so great,Hercules was ama|zed at the fame of those Queenes. that
Hercules hearing the fame of them, and of their
courts,  of their wome~, was much abashed, that
so many Nations should be subdued by wome~.
Hercules, after Perseus, in great furie began
his warre against these Queenes, (after Myrina
and Medusaes time, with whome Perseus fought)
and slue so many (I meane of the Gorgans and A|mazones)
that Queene Myrina buried so many of
her Ladies, that to this day their graue is called
Tumuli Amazonum: which is in Greece, and
not in Scythia.
Among other Nations and Kingdomes the
Court of the Queenes of Saca, ought iustly for
their misitary discipline, their victories and go|uernment
to bee remembred.The queene of Saca. Among many
Queenes that ruled there, I will onely speake of
one Queene, named Tarina, who after shee had
subdued the Nations about her,Queene Ta|rinaes victory.
and brought in
subiection many countries vnder the Saceans, af|ter
peace and quietnesse, had made such Lawes
to her Subiects that the Queenes which succee|ded
her, altered nothing therof, but one Queene
after another confirmed Tarinas Lawes in Saca.
Such was the loue  commendations of this

Queene, of her Subiects in her Court, for her
pollicy, wisedome, counsell, and benefits done
to her countrey, that such a Sepulcher was made
for her after her death, that the Pyramides of E|gipt,
and the Labyrinth of Creete might well giue
place vnto it. Neither might Mauseolum it selfe,
which Queene Artimesia made for King Mauso|lus
her husbands Tombe, be preferred, though
that Tombe was numbred one of the seauen
wonders of the world.
The Queenes of ScythiaThe Queens of Scythia. their Court, a known
History; whose antiquitie is such that Diodorus,
Cetesis and others  of. But the Queenes
of Scythia, howsoeuer they were first named, en|larged
their kingdomes so greatly, that some were
called , and some A|rimaspi;
all warlike Queenes, which subdued
much of Asia, and of Europe, so that many of the
Queenes of the AmazonesThe Queens of Ama|zones  with the most fa|mous con|querors of the world. are most renowned
for the watres which they had with the greatest
Conquerors of the world.
As Queen  with Hercules, Queen Tari|na
with Pers, Queene  with Achilles,
Queen  with Cyrus, whom she slue in bat|tell,
with 200000. Persians with him. And after
Cyrus was slayne in Scythia, King Darius thought
to reueng that shame, that the great King of Per|sea
with his army should be slayne by a woman,
but Darius was glad to leaue Scythia vnto wome~,
and to returne vnto Persia.

And also of Camilla, who came armed against
Aeneas and his Troian army;Camilla. with so many Kings
as well of Asia, as of Europe, who felt the courage
of the Queenes of Scythia, that Kings payde Tri|bute
to Queenes in Asia.
The women Laxamathae were Marshall wo|men
on horse backe, the men of that country on
oote;The women Laxama|thae mar|shallwomen. In the field the woman fought on horse|backe
with halters and short strong ropes, and
the men with speares and argats.
The women of Sparta, are preferred before
men.The women of Sparta prferred for councell and courage be|fore men. All care and busines of Sparta are layde
vpon the women. For they sit in Councell, they
Iudge in causes, and make such Lawes and de|crees
as to them seemed good; which being ob|iected
against by a certaine Gentleman, that on|ly

What can be sayd of men, but as much may bet

These be the scoffes of Cato against the Roman
