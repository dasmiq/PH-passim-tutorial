TO THE RIGHT
NOBLE, THE SONNES
of the most High, his bles|sed
Brethren by the best,
that is, the second
Birth.
_TRuly Honorable, whose
Father is God, and
whose Inheritance a
Kingdome; the diuers sparks of
holy fire, which haue issued from
the Spirit that baptizeth with
fire, I haue gathered together;
by their vnited heate, to kindle
a flame where is none, or to in|crease
it, where it is alreadie
kindled. This blessing must
come from God, and therefore
of God haue I desired it. And

surely the best, as ye well know,
haue turnes of winter, euen vp|on
their hottest zeale, and then
woe to him that is alone, for how
should he haue heate? Therfore
if in the time of cooling, some
spirituall worke be ioyned to the
heart, it may bee warmth will
grow betweene them. So haue
I often from Elisha applied,
euen some Prophet of God, re|ceiued
life; and I wish, that
some quickning may proceede
also from this worke; which in
all writings is more or lesse, as
the Spirit therein more or lesse
speaketh.
These Meditations are in|deede
diuers in their matter,
being diuersly borne, both in re|gard
of time and occasion; yet
tend they to one ende, and this
profit often comes from variety,

that some one thing among ma|ny,
fitteth euery one, and giues
an answere to the particular
question of his heart. The glorie
of God by your benefite, is that
which I seeke, desiring also to be
holpen by you, both in prayer
and exhortation. As for an idle
name, made vp still, of perishing,
and often of corrupt breaths, I
leaue it to them for an end, to
whom God is not an end suffici|ent.
But let our chiefe ioy and
glory be to glorifie God, and by
being written in heauen, to bee
admitted vnto the beholding of
his glory. To that mark, my be|loued,
let vs steadily aime, and
sending our hearts before vnto
Christ, let vs goe on lustily
to ouertake them. Let vs
draw hard vp the hill toward
heauen: and though the flesh

presse downe, the world and Sa|tan
draw backe; yet strengthe|ned
by the Spirit, incouraged by
the word, and fortified with the
mutuall and vnited force of
mightie loue, let vs carry the
Arke of God, euen the soule
(wherein Gods Image dwells,
and his will is written) from the
Countrey of the Philistims, to
the Land of promise. And
though heere our fleshly bre|thren,
Ismael and his heires,
mocke and despise vs, though
Esau with his foure hundred
men looke big vpon vs: yet are
we sure that their time is short,
and but for life; whereas wee
haue an inheritance eternally
glorious. Thither the sonnes of
the flesh, though with long pe|degrees,
and large treasures, can
neuer enter; but sitting without,

where is weeping and gnashing
of teeth, they shallsee despised
holinesse, triumph vpon magni|ficent
and powerfull wickednes.
God our strength, whose cloud
and pillar guided Israel to Ca|naan,
guide vs to the heauenly
Ierusalem, by the grace of his
Spirit. This I humbly desire
through Christ his first borne,
the purchaser of our inheritance
and doore of all the mercy
that issueth from God
vnto man.
One of your least worthy
brethren, but a great
louer of you, and
your peace.

THe maine Faultinesse
of these Times, is a
Disproportion, be|tweene
Knowledge
and Action; or rather a
meere resting in knowledge
short of Action. So are we
come from no knowledge,
to knowledge alone, which
will not lessen, but increase
our iudgement; and from
the ouerualuing of workes,
to the Neglect of them.
Surely the errour of workes
without knowledge, is lesse
dangerous then the error of
knowledge without works:

But this is the best of it, it is
the doctrine of our Nature,
not of our Diuinitie. For
while it is taught, that
workes deserue not, some
are content to thinke they
are vselesse; others being
truly perswaded of their vse,
yet slouthfull to goodnesse,
lie down in knowledge, and
will not goe on to the la|bour
of action. But as here|after
the paine will follow
the fault, so now let the
shame: for certainly it is a
great shame, that so much
knowledge should be idle,
and that skilful men should
sleepe in this Midday light;
for the light was made for
walking and working, not
for idlenesse. The Father
sheweth his will, because he

will haue it done; wee are
called to be sonnes, because
we should do the will of our
Father: and Nebuchadnez|zar
giues the greatest title,
when hee calls the three
children the seruants of the
most high God. In the Spi|rit
wherein is Life, is also
Actiuenesse: If we nourish
not the actiuitie of it, we
decay the Life,  so kill our
selues with eternall Death.
Christ hath no dead or vn|profitable
Limbes, they all
beare fruite, or are not his;
and Faith which our slouth
would magnifie, by resting
in her, thrusts vs on for her
life to action; for shee liues
onely when she is actiue. If
then faith not working, bee
dead, and dead faith quic|kens

not; the vnactiue be|leeuer
may speedily with a
Heathen see himselfe with|out
life. As these things may
driue vs, so the value of
workes may draw vs: for by
Christ who worketh them
in vs, they are accepted of
God, and haue a valuation
stamped vpon them, by his
Grace for Grace. And first,
though workes iustifie not
vs, they iustifie our Faith,
 in the day of iustice they
shall goe so farre toward iu|stifying
vs, that they shall
declare vs iust. In the meane
time, they please and glori|fie
God, the giuer of such
gifts vnto men, and then e|uen
the least of them shall
haue a reward of glory,
which they shall set as a

crowne on their heads that
wrought them. Let vs not
therefore bee wanting to
this glorie belonging to
God from vs, and issuing
from God to vs. Besides, if
we will co~sider what works
are in themselues, we shall
finde that they are streames
of the Deity, their fountain,
and sparkes of that heauen|ly
and eternall fire. Accor|dingly
they present and ex|presse
something that is Di|uine,
and supernaturally ex|celle~t;
whence it was that a
Reuerend Ancient wel said:
The deedes and conuersa|tion
of the Primitiue Chri|stians,
had in them a per|fume
and sweetnesse, wher|with
they exceedingly de|lighted
those with whome

they conuersed. And how
can it otherwise be, for whe~
he that is blessednesse, and
excellence, powreth vertue
from himselfe into these
workes; they must needs
haue a resemblance  par|taking
of their original. And
surely there are two things
in them, which as they are
the most pleasant of all o|ther,
so they most resemble,
and approach to the Crea|tor.
One of these is Light,
and the other is Loue; both
which put life and soule in|to
euery good worke. God
is Light, and God is Loue
and it is a pleasant thing to
behold the Light; and Loue
is as the precious oyntment
which was powred on the
head of Aaron. Wherefore

good workes beeing a Di|uine
 heauenly off-spring,
let them bee highly respe|cted
and carefully cherish|ed
by vs. Againe, workes are
to vs strong euidences of the
Spirit of Life, and therefore
as sure as wee would be of
our saluation, so carefull let
vs be of good works: shame|full
it were for them who
are so scrupulous and eagre
for security co~cerning tem|porall
things, not to bee
more eagre for the ensuing
of their Election. Lastly,
they are excellent in regard
of the benefite they doe to
mankinde, which also is
manifold. They doe good
by the worke wrought, and
so they are as the dewe of
Heauen, which refresheth

and nourisheth the drie and
thirstie land. Surely to a
good Christian there is no|thing
more pleasant then to
do good. For as he especial|ly
delighteth therein, to
please his Maker, so he ex|ceedingly
reioyceth, there|by
to profit his neighbour.
They doe good also by ex|ample,
for they come be|fore
men as patternes; their
sound goes forth and tels
mankinde what should bee
done, what may be done;
and so they palpably per|swade
men to be followers
of them, that are followers
of Christ. Againe, workes
doe good vnto men, while
they are mooued by them,
to lift vp their hearts and
eyes vnto the heauenly Fa|ther,

to glorifie him that gi|ueth
such gifts to earthen
and corrupted vessels. And
whensoeuer God is glorifi|ed
by man, man that glori|fies
him shall be blessed of
God; whensoeuer glorie is
giuen to God on high, peace
and good will shall be be|stowed
on Men below. If
these things will not yet
mooue vs, at least, let vs pre|uent
the taking away of our
candlesticke  the remoo|uing
of it, to a nation that
will bring forth more fruite.
Let vs preuent the scandall
and shame, which we pur|chase
to our selues from the
enemies of our Religion.
Let vs preuent the vpbray|ding
of Chorazin and Beth|saida,
Finally let vs preuent

that fearefull sentence: I
know ye not, depart from me all
ye workers of iniquitie. This
shall we doe, if wee becom
right Christians in whome
faith worketh by loue: For
the soule that is rooted in
Christ, hath from this root,
the life of Loue, Diuine, and
Humane, which expresseth
it selfe outwardly in the
fruite of good actions.


2
It is a great vnhappinesse
to many, that they mistake
good nature for grace: For
so doing they set vp their
rest in it, thinking they are
gone farre enough towards
God, because they wish all
well,  no hurt to any. But
it must bee knowne that
good nature at the best is

not grace, yea it is full of en|mities
that fight against
Grace. For though it bee
somewhat apt and appliable
to the second Table, yet it
is euer far short of the first,
not hauing in it that true
knowledge  loue of God,
nor that inward purenesse
which therein is required.
So the obseruing of the se|cond
Table, is faulty, for
want of the first; for if a
man do neuer so many see|ming
good workes, if they
proceede not from a heart
truely sanctified by God,
they are glittering sinnes is|suing
from a corrupt foun|taine,
and tending to the sea
of death. For nature is ex|ceedingly
blinde toward
God, neither beholding, nor

worshipping him as god, yea
it is peruerted from God, 
against God,  chuseth ma|ny
things to it selfe in stead
of God. Now that which is
blind cannot leade vs the
right way, and that which
straieth, leadeth vs a false
way, euen a way from life.
Therefore let-vs employ
our iudgements vpon our
owne estates, that we may
know whether there bee in
vs something more then
Nature, and by which Na|ture
it self may be rectified
and directed to the true
scope and marke, which is
God. If there be in vs this
godly and immortall seede,
let vs water it, let vs cherish
it, as the life of our life; if it
be not in vs, let vs violently

knock at the doore of hea|uen
with grones, with pan|ting
desires, with vehement
supplications, vntill there
be an opening to our knoc|king,
a giuing to our ask|ing;
and vntill they that
thirst may drinke freely of
the waters of life. Other|wise
if in a lazy contented|nesse,
we lie along vpon the
streame of Nature, suffering
it to carry vs whither it list|eth;
certainly it slideth a|long
to death, and all the
benefit wee can pick out of
it is this, that we go thither
pleasantly.


3
The goodnes of any world|ly
thing which so much
pleaseth and moueth vs, is
but a spark of infinite good|nesse,

which dwells in God,
the author of it. If then wee
loue these small and transi|torie
things with so great
an affection, proportiona|bly
should wee raise our
affection (if it were possi|ble)
toward God, as much
aboue it, as God is aboue
his creature. At least, let
the creature when it giueth
vs any comfort, bee a re|membrancer
vnto vs of
God, pointing to him as
the Author of euery good
thing, and our soueraigne
Good.


4
Hauing vndertaken the
profession of Christians,
and considering in our
owne thoughts, the perse|cutions
and tentations that

may befal vs, or co~ferring of
them with others, let vs not
promise to our selues or o|thers
ouermuch strength or
constancy; let vs not pro|mise
ouer confidently what
we will do, lest with Peter,
wee performe nothing of
that which we promise. For
the strength which must do
this worke of resisting and
ouercomming temptation
is not our owne but Gods:
and how canst thou pro|mise
that which is anothers?
That which is ours, is onely
the strength of flesh and
bloud; now flesh and bloud,
bee it neuer so lusty, is no
match for temptations and
persecutions. Indeede the
spirits of men in prosperitie
are prompt and forward,

their imaginatio~s of them|selues
are high, and they
dare boast of great things.
But let vs know that the
diuell ouercame man at the
best, and what may wee
not doubt of our selues, the
weake issue of man fallen
to the worst? Let vs there|fore
rather mistrust our
owne strength, confessing
it to be weakenesse; and in
humility and confession of
our weakenesse, runne to
God,  call him our Rocke
and our strength. Let vs
say: By my God I can break
through an hoste, and by
him I can leape ouer a wall
of temptations. And that
we may obtaine God to be
our strength, let vs instant|ly
beg of him that Spirit of

Fire, which makes men
strongly to endure the fiery
tryall. Let vs pray to him
that he will continue to do
in vs, what hee hath bin ac|customed
to do in others,
euen in infirmitie to make
his strength plaine and eui|dent.
And that we may be
fully capable of the grace
we pray for, let vs present
our selues, as vessels empty,
and altogether voide, that
of fulnesse we may receiue
fulnesse. In summe, let vs so
speake, let vs so thinke of
our selues as holy Paul: In
vs, that is in our flesh, there
is no goodnesse, but wee
hope and desire to doe all
things through Christ that
strengthens vs, euen to be
more then Conquerours,

through Christ that loueth
vs.


5
All sorts of men propose
to themselues a happinesse
 hauing proposed it, they
seeke it with al their might,
neglecting all things in co|parison
of it. The happi|nesse
of the Gentiles is
this world; and therefore
they striue toward it with
all their strength, negle|cting
the kingdome of
heauen in regard of the
world. But the happinesse
of a Christian is the king|dome
of God, and setting
his heart thereon, he despi|seth
the world in compa|rison
of it, and endeauours
wholly for faith and rege|neration,
the meanes to

attaine it. Now the Christi|ans
haue great aduantages
of the Heathen: For besides
that our happinesse is eter|nall,
theirs transitory; ours
increaseth a man, theirs ad|deth
nothing to man: wee
haue euen their happinesse
for an aduantage, though
not for an happinesse. For
this world was made for
the next,  whosoeuer haue
a right to the next, they on|ly
haue a right to this, and
a promise that so much of
this world shal be added to
them, as is necessarie for
them, in their way to the
next. Hee that sets vs in a
Iourney, will giue vs foode
in the Iourney as hee did
Manna to the Israelites tra|uailing
to Canaan,  bread

and drinke to Elias, when
he was to go the great iour|ney
to the Mount of God.
Surely if the Creator giue
himselfe to vs, how shall he
not giue his creatures with
himselfe? Therefore as we
auoide the loue of the
Gentiles, so let vs auoide
their feare: as we loue not
the world, as our chiefe
good, so let vs not feare the
losse of the world, as a
chiefe euill; especially since
we haue a sure, stedfast, and
vnmooueable word, God
will not faile vs, nor forsake
vs. Surely they that know
thy name will trust in thee
O Lord; for they haue
seene and felt that thou
hast not failed them that
seeke thee.



6
The Sunne of the soule
is God: while shee is here
therefore without God, she
hath but her owne light,
which is but as the light of
the eye without the Sunne,
 is little more then blind|nesse.
Let vs therefore still
aspire to that high and per|fect
light, where the soule
looking out with open
sight, shall behold a Sunne
infinitely more passing this
Sunne, then the soule doth
the eye. In the meane time
let vs be farre from setting
our content on this dunge|on,
where the soule dwel|leth
in darkenesse; but in a
godly disco~tent let vs striue
here, to get some ray of
that purest light, which

may guide vs through this
darkenesse, and from it, vn|to
that glorious citie, wher|in
God is the Sunne.


7
The nature of man be|ing
subiect to passions, is
very apt to amend one vice
with another, and to runne
from one extremity, iust as
farre as another. The ciuill
and spirituall powers are
two, that may and would
well liue together, in mu|tuall
comfort and vnitie.
But in the first times after
Christ, the ciuill power
mightily destroyed, and di|minished
the spiritual, hun|ting
the possessors thereof
as partriches on the moun|taines.
After this the clear|gie
hauing gotten power

enough at least to right
themselues, aduanced to|ward
the limits of the tem|poralty,
and at length in|uaded
the very sword and
scepter thereof. This being
the disease of the cleargy,
it was mightily purged, and
now it concernes the Lai|ty,
whose turne is next to
be faulty, to looke to it self,
that it continue not these
circular euils. Likewise the
Papists digged downe the
foundation, to build vp
the walles, they tooke from
Christ to magnifie workes.
Now let vs take heede that
we make not all foundati|on,
and so indeede make no
foundation; for Christ is
not a foundation to them
that build not vpon him.

The Popish Cleargie coue|red
their people with
blindnesse, and then gaue
them a line, which they
willingly followed; ours
desireth to guide and fill
vs with light: now farre
bee it from vs, so to hate
blindnesse, that we doe no|thing
but stare on the light.
Light on earth is a guide to
light in heauen, but it is no
guide to them that doe not
follow it; yea to such in the
day of darkenesse it shal be|come
an accuser. But thogh
darknes should bring forth
more workes then light,
yet Hagar may not boast
against Sara, nor ignorance
against knowledg. For first,
these workes of ignorance
are the children of the

bondwoman, euen of our
naturall corruption;  ther|fore
shall not inherite with
the children of grace, the
freewoman, neither shall
they obtaine any reward.
Secondly, nature spreads o|uer
all mankinde, but true
sanctifying grace comes in|to
few. Now superstition is
rooted in nature, and so is
generall with nature; and
therefore it is no wonder if
that which is general, bring
forth more general, and co~|mon
fruits: neither if grace
which dwels but in the few
that enter in at the narrow
gate, makes the lesse muster,
and outward apparence.


8
A Christian man hath as
much neede of Christs Spi|rit
to be a Christian, and to

liue eternally, as a naturall
man hath of a Spirit to be a
man, and to liue temporal|ly.
For as the soule and the
bodie are a man, so Christs
Spirit and man are a Chri|stian,
which is a holy, eter|nall
and happy thing.


9
When a Christian hath
committed some notable
sinne, there presently open
before him two dangerous
gulfs ready to swallow him;
one of them is Despaire, the
other, Presumption. Hee is
tempted to beleeue, that he
cannot be forgiuen, or that
he is very easily forgiuen;
and so Gods mercy is too
much assumed or refused.
But against presumption,
should bee set as a counter|poyse,

the Maiestie and Iu|stice
of the great God that
is offended, the foulenesse
and deformitie of sinne in
the sight of that God, the
breach of the Couenant
made with God, both at
the outward, and inward
Baptisme; the grieuing of
the Spirit, with which wee
are sealed vnto redempti|on:
and finally, the tempo|rall
punishments, where|with
God chastiseth his
transgressing seruants, espe|cially,
not iudging, hum|bling,
or chastising them|selues.
Surely God is infi|nite
in Maiesty, the heauen
of heauens cannot containe
him, the Angels cannot ful|ly
behold him, the Sun and
Starres are not pure in com|parison

of him. The same
God, is a iust  iealous God,
visiting sin and iniquity: for
sin is more lothsome in his
sight, then the most abhor|red
filthinesse, or foulest
soares, are in the eies of me~.
As for thy Couenant, thou
hast mightily broke~ it: thou
gauest thy selfe to God in
generall, and now thou ta|kest
thy selfe from him in
particulars: thou madest an
agreement with him to bee
his seruant, if he would bee
thy God; he is become thy
God, and thou failest in thy
promised seruice. Besides,
thou grieuest the Spirit,
that co~forts thee: thou art
a great vexatio~ to him, who
is thy chiefe consolation:
thou frettest that which is

thy life eternall, and goest
about to quench him, who
would quicken thee vnto
glorie euerlasting. Lastly,
that the punishments of sin
may come within thy con|sideration,
remember Da|uid,
for whose adultery and
murder, his child of adul|tery
died; his wiues were
polluted with incest, and
himselfe by his owne bow|els,
was driuen from his pa|lace
into the fields of the
wildernes. Remember He|zekiah,
for the lifting vp of
whose heart, the Treasures
must be carried into Babi|lon.
Remember the Corin|thians,
of whom many were
sicke and many slept, be|cause
they had sinned, and
slept in their sinnes. Wher|fore

make hast, run to God
right early, acknowledge
thy sinne against thy selfe,
and humble thy selfe vnder
the mightie hand of God,
that in due time he may ex|alt
thee. That is the onely
right exaltation which is
done by God, and humilia|tion
of thy selfe is the onely
way to it: but an exaltation
of thy selfe without God,
will turne to an humiliati|on
by God, if not a con|fusion.
But if thou wash|est
away the pleasure of
sin, by the sorrow of repen|tance,
if thou washest away
the pollution and deformi|tie
of sinne, by cleannesse
of heart, and rightnesse of
Spirit, then mayst thou lay
hold on the satisfaction of

Christ to wash away the
guilt of thy sin, and so thou
art wholly made cleane. As
God will not haue his mer|cie
to bee made an encou|ragement
to sinne, so hee
will not haue his iustice to
bee a discouragement to
them that turne from their
sinnes: but iustice belongs
to the presumptuous to
humble them, and mercy
to the humble and broken
hearted to refresh them.
Come therefore thou that
art heauy laden, which fee|lest
thy sinnes as a burden
intolerable, take the refresh|ing
which belongeth to
thee; and looke not on the
terror of iustice any longer,
which belongeth to the
presumptuous, and not to

thee. God will not that the
reed brused by the Law,
should bee vtterly broken,
but that it be healed by the
Gospell. Gods aime in thy
humbling is not despaire,
but Faith, Hope and Loue;
his end is thy amendment,
and not thy torment. But if
thou doubtest that so great
a sinne hath cut thee off
from Christ, and therefore
thou darest not to make
vse of his merits, know this,
that by thy faith, which
made a generall surrender
of thee vnto Christ, thou
wast ingrafted into Christ;
Christ was thine, and thou
wert his. Now this Vnion
is indissoluble, nothing can
put asunder what God
hath thus put together. Be|sides,

Christ in his Vnion
with thee, did not wholly
take away thy wilde nature,
but powring in a godly na|ture,
left also some remain|der
of thy former wildnes.
If then this wilde nature
bring forth the fruit of the
wilde oliue, it is no wonder;
for it is so left, that some|times
when God hideth his
face, it may leade vs away
captiue vnto the execution
of sinne. Yet the Spirit of
Christ euen the~ liueth in vs,
though in bondage, for the
time; and grace is then not
put to death, but only made
prisoner. The seed of Christ
remaines immortal, he is stil
in thee, though sometimes
thou bearest thy own fruite
and not his. A generall

dominion of sinne, exclu|deth
a generall dominion
of Christ: but a particular
sinne may yet leaue a gene|rall
dominion to Christ.
Thou mislikest thy selfe be|cause
thou art not holy in
all things: thou dost well to
loue and desire perfection;
yet though thou offendest
in some thing, doe not de|spaire,
for God hath not gi|uen
any man in this life so
much grace, as may giue
him a generall rest from sin;
he leaueth this world as a
place of battaile and com|bate,
and referreth perfect
rest vnto the world to
come. Now the same God,
though in iustice hee re|quires
a full obedience, yet
in mercy he accepteth ac|cording

to that wee haue;
 hee knowes we haue no|thing,
but what wee haue
receiued, and we haue re|ceiued
only so much grace,
as may exclude the domi|nion
of sinne, but not abo|lish
the being of it. Let vs
therfore not so much busie
our selues in superfluous
and vnprofitable vexation
of our own soules, as in the
study of purging our selues
from our sins, that wee may
bring forth more fruit. This
is it which God especially
lookes for after sin, and so
doing we shall vndeniably
proue to our selues, that we
are still the liuely branches
of Christ. A mans seruant
doth sometimes his owne
worke, yet if he presently

returne to the worke of his
Master, and makes that his
chiefe and maine employ|ment,
he ceaseth not to bee
his seruant, since most hee
serueth him. So and much
more is it betweene Christ
and vs; We are his, though
somtimes seruing our selues
especially being held by
him, out of whose hand no|thing
can take vs. Therfore
thou distressed soule, goe
thy waies, and indeuour to
sinne no more, and then
thy faith shall make thee
whole.


10
The diuell hath put the
world out of frame,  that
in two ouerspreading con|fusions;
One is sinne, the o|ther
misery. Now Christ

came to vnloose the works
of the diuel, and performes
it both in himselfe and in
his members. His owne
part he hath fully perfected
in himselfe, and now it re|maines
that we ioyne with
him to performe that part,
which is to bee done by
Christ in vs. Therefore a|gainst
sin, wherin the world
blindly walketh, let vs op|pose
sanctification, seeking
to place it in the stead ther|of,
both in our selues and o|thers.
Against misery let vs
employ the inward  out|ward
consolations which
God hath giuen vs, relee|uing
refreshing, and encou|raging
all distressed pati|ents.
This must we doe, yet
we may not expect that the

worke shall bee perfected
vntill the great day come.
Then onely shall be a pure
separation of things now
confounded. Then onely
shall the sinne and misery
which now cleaue to the
Saints, fully be wiped away;
and then shall a kingdome
come, wherein holinesse,
and happinesse, lifted vp
farre aboue sinne and mi|sery,
shall eternally dwell
together. In the meane
time we must patiently be|hold
many crooked things
which no man can make
streight, and yet we must
striue to reforme the croo|kednesse
that may be made
streight. Blessed are wee if
when our Lord commeth
he shall finde vs so doing;

wee shall haue our part in
the sentence of blessing,
and our workes of mercie
 righteousnesse shal praise
vs in the gates of heauen.
And the same Christ who
hath here wrought mighti|ly
in vs vnto the perfecting
and aduancing of his king|dome,
shall there worke
maruellously for vs vnto
the aduancing of vs in his
kingdome.


11
There is great reason,
though it breed but little
practise, that we should put
the loue of the creature far
below the loue of the
Creator, the loue of things
perishing below the loue of
things enduring for euer,
the loue of things made for

vs, below the loue of him
that made vs,  for whom
we were made. With this
reaso~, there is ioyned great
reward, for at last things
transitory will part from
vs, and the loue placed on
them; but God continues
for euer, euen after the o|ther
haue forsaken vs, and
then rewards the loue built
on him with an euerlasting
loue: and on this loue at|tend
Ioyes vnspeakable,
and a crowne of glory Im|marcessible.


12
Our knowledge in this
world is little and imper|fect,
but they that haue
Christ by vnion with him,
haue a perfect wisedome,
and are in him perfectly

wise. Let vs therefore e|steeme
our selues,  others
more or lesse wise, as we are
more or lesse partakers of
that high and infinite wise|dome;
and therein especial|ly
let vs striue for Supere|minence.
If in this litle and
narrow knowledge of man
wee only excell others, it
may bee a iust ground of
co~tempt against our selues,
rather then a reason of that
pride which is commonly
assumed, and imployed in
despising others. For those
whom this humane wise|dome
despiseth, may haue
an assured Right in the Di|uine
wisedome; which in
the foolishnesse thereof is
wiser then the wisest of
men: and which being wise,

approoues her children for
the most wise, for iustifying
of her; and which finally
shall raise vp her meanest
children in so true an image
of God, that in regard of
their new vnderstanding,
the Schoole-taught know|ledge
euen of old Doctors,
shall bee ashamed of the
name of knowledge, and
shall appeare to bee but as
the rudiments of children.
Let Christ therefore be the
wisedome, by which man|kinde
should be especially
measured, and valued; so
shall the iudging of them
be according to truth, not
outward appearance, we
shall iudge the iudgement
of God and not of man.



13
If any man haue done
some excellent worke, by
wit, learning or valour, we
ascend presently from the
excellencie of the worke, to
the excellencie of the wor|ker,
imagining him to be a
fountaine wherof his work
is but a streame, and wee
earnestly desire to see the
more excellent cause, of so
excellent an effect. This is
the ordinary course of na|turall
Men; yet is there a
most notable and incom|prehensible
worke, the
worke that containeth all
humane workes, yea man
himselfe, and this worke is
daily seene; but few ascend
from the worke to consi|der
the worker, and much

fewer desire to see him, and
fewest of all wonder that
they doe not desire. Surely
to a rectified soule, it is a
great wonder, that for At|chieuements
small in com|parison
of this great one,
wee should looke vp with
loue  admiration to their
cause; but for this huge
worke, we should not lift
vp our eyes and desires, to
the cause thereof, which
indeed comprehendeth, 
causeth all other causes. But
againe the same soule cea|seth
to wonder when it
lookes on the fall of man;
for therin it sees mans chie|fest
corruption was in that
fleshly wisedome which
hath blinded vs to the
Creator,  makes vs broad-sighted

to the creature;
which hath put the head of
a beast into the heart of a
man, and makes him looke
downward with the beasts,
from the maker to things
made. But it is our part to
vnhood our selues as much
as we may from this vizard
of wisedome, and to iudge
of things according to
cleare truth, not blinde opi|nion.
Let vs pursue truth as
long as it lasteth, not so
long only as our muffled
vnderstanding doth natu|rally
and easily follow and
apprehend it. In this course
of outgoing nature, yet let
vs set our first foote in her
owne pathe: So on her
ground we fasten this, that
the Author is more excel|lent

then the worke, the
cause then the effect, and
therefore if it be pleasant or
glorious to see and know
the worke and effect, it is
farre more pleasant  glo|rious,
to see the cause and
author himselfe. But where|as
grouelling nature applies
this rule only to these low|er
things, we knowing that
the truth thereof proceeds
further, yea reacheth espe|cially
to the cause of causes:
let vs out-strip nature, and
follow this truth, vntill it
leade vs into an amazing
wonder, a feruent loue, a
longing desire, to see that
great producer of all excel|lent
workes; that infinite
being, from whom all this
masse of Creation hath his

Being, and who as farre ex|ceedeth
in wisedome, pow|er,
and glory, the created
wisedome, power, and glo|ry,
as an infinite and inde|terminable
cause, may ef|fects
finite and determi|ned.


14
If God haue reuealed a
truth to vs, which hath bin
long concealed, let vs not
seeke to haue our selues
proclaimed as the foun|taines
of that truth, nor
draw followers to our
selues, but to it, and by it to
God. For God is the Au|thor
and fountaine of all
truth, and of the reuelati|on
of truth; and so the truth
found is Gods, and the fin|ding
of the truth, apper|taines

to the grace of God.
Therefore let vs desire to
get glory to him, to whom
the glory indeede belongs.
And humbly thanking
God, that among many of
his excellent seruants, hee
hath vouchsafed to vse vs
in the reuealing of it; let vs
steale away our own names
if we may from the honour
thereof, leauing the whole
glory to the name of God,
whose worke it is. If thus
we draw men to the truth,
 by the truth vnto God;
not to Paul or Cephas, but
vnto Christ; this seeking
of gods glory with the losse
of our owne, will God re|ward
with infinite glorie:
whereas the setting vp of
our selues in Gods stead, the

iealous God will punish
with extreame torments, as
most odious idolatry. Yet
euen in this life to such
humble seers doth honour
belong, though not the ho|nour
of fountaines, yet the
honour of cesternes, euen
the honour due to such as
God honours, by commit|ting
to them his oracles
and secrets. And euen to
their humility belongeth
honour, for humility is
Gods way to preferment;
which though it takes a|way
the value of our selues
to our selues, yet as an excel|lent
grace it ought to in|crease
the same value, in the
sight of others as it doth in
the sight of God.



15
When there comes any
pleasure to be lost, or paine
to bee suffered for Gods
sake, let vs set vp a balance
in our hearts: in one scale,
let vs set the temporal plea|sure
we lose, and in the o|ther,
the eternall pleasure
we gaine by this losse; and
wee shall see the weight of
this latter to bee infinitely
exceeding. So likewise for
paine, let vs set the tempo|rall
paine in one balance,
and the eternal in the other;
and wee shall see there also
the weight of eternal paine
farre to exceed that of the
temporall. Now if we vse
but our ordinarie iudge|ment,
of good things to
chuse the greatest, and of

euils to chuse the least, we
shal presently consent with
the losse of temporall plea|sure,
to procure eternal ioy,
and with the enduring of
temporall paine, to auoide
paine eternall; especially,
since with the auoiding of
that eternall torment, the
exceeding weight of ioy, is
ioyntly procured.


16
There is a great craft of
Satan, which passeth too
much vnmarked, or vnresi|sted,
and this it is; That he
seekes by all meanes to
keepe his owne kingdome
whole and vndeuided, and
to diuide by schismes and
contentions, the kingdome
and body of Christ; that by
the malice of such conten|tions,

the flocke of Christ
may bite one another, and
consequently deuoure one
another, and so doe Satans
busines for him. But it be|houeth
Christians to note
this his cunning, and with
detestation to beware, that
they be not Satans in stru|ments,
nor become those
mad members which fight
and strike one at another,
and seek to teare that asun|der,
which God hath vnse|parably
ioyned together.
And lamentable indeed is
this madnesse and folly: for
the main busines of Christ,
effected by a bloudy death,
and bitter passion, is, to set
in vnitie and peace, the
things in heauen and earth.
Besides, he hath left as a le|gacie

to his Church, the
preseruation and continu|ance
of the vnitie which
himselfe began; As I haue
loued you, so loue yee one
another. Againe, Christ
hath prayed to his Father,
that we may be one, as hee
and his Father is one. Now
cursed is hee that goes a|bout
to breake this three-fold
cord, and endeuours
to frustrate the death of
Christ, the co~mandement
of Christ, and the prayer of
Christ. But thou wilt say, I
diuide my selfe from him,
and oppose my selfe against
him, because he opposeth
himselfe against Christ in
some vncurable errour. But
take thou heed that this er|ror
separate him fro~ Christ,

and remooue the foundati|on,
else thou canst not hate
him. For when men agree
in the sauing foundation,
they become one body and
one building, vnited vpon
that foundation, and vnto
it. Now when men ac|knowledge
Christ, in whom
is the Trinitie vnited to
man, to be happinesse, and
the onely meanes of happi|nesse,
euen the Doore, the
Way, and the Life; and to
this Christ wholly resigne
and surrender themselues,
to be iustified, to be sancti|fied
by him; these haue re|ceiued
into themselues, the
roote of Life; they are one
with Christ, and one a|mong
themselues. But that
these vnited members, be|cause

one receiued this
faith of Paul, another of
Peter; because one belee|ueth
something more, ano|ther
somthing lesse in mat|ters
not absolutely necessa|rie
to saluation, nor direct|ly
ouerthrowing the foun|dation;
should mutually
hate and reuile one ano|ther,
should shunne mutuall
conuersation, should prose|cute
and persecute one an|other
with enuenomed
tongues, is most vnreasona|ble
and lamentable. Is not
the solide vnion betweene
them a more cause of loue,
then the slight difference a
cause of hate? Nay, will
Christ allow, that there is
any cause sufficie~t, to make
his members hate one ano|ther,

whom he hath tied in
the bond of peace, by such
mighty knots? Especially
right lothsome is it to him,
to haue his name vsed for a
pretence of such hatred,
which aboue all names, is
the name of loue and peace.
Surely Christ knowes, that
when men in this kind pre|tend
to serue Christ, they
indeede serue Satan. Hee
knowes that vnitie is the
preseruation of his king|dome,
and diuision, the de|struction
of all kingdomes.
Therfore if thou wilt please
Christ, preserue his King|dome
by preseruing vnity;
it pleaseth not the head, to
haue his member, brused,
bitten, or hurt. He allowes
not the member of greater

knowledge, to bee proud
ouer a member of lesse
knowledge, much lesse to
make their difference of
knowledge, a ground of
hatred. He himselfe forgiues
this ignorance and errour,
for which thou hatest thy
brother, and offers vp his
bloud to the Father that he
may be forgiuen. Yea hee
loueth this brother not|withstanding
his error, and
what art thou then to hate
one whom Christ loueth?
Euen thy selfe also (though
perchance thou thinke it
not) art by Christ, borne
with, and forgiuen for grea|ter
errours and ignorances;
for of thee and vs stil, Christ
knowes this to be true, that
yet wee know but in part.

Therefore thou that pre|tendest
to please thy Head,
bee truly conformable to
him, and thou shalt indeed
please him. Loue where he
loues, and beare with him
with whom he beareth. O|bey
that new commande|ment
of his, That yee loue
one another. Expresse this
loue in instructing thy bro|ther,
if he be ignorant; and
hate him not, though he be
so weake, that hee cannot
receiue thy instruction. He
is yet grounded on Christ,
hee is yet a liuing member
of Christ, he is still a souldi|er
for Christ; therefore still
ioyne with him, and com|fort
him in the battels of
the Lord. Take heed thou
quench not that which

smoketh, nor beate downe
the weake hands, which
should be lifted vp against
Satan, and that thou dimi|nish
not one of Christs
Band. But assemble rather,
incourage, and vnite the ar|my
of God, perswading
them to grow strong by
growing on; that so being
mutually strengthened by
vnion, we may be more vic|torious
in our fighting for
God; and ouercomming,
may be admitted to eate of
the Manna which is hid,
and to reigne with Christ
for euermore. Let vs bee
glad of company in this
our pilgrimage to heauen,
and farre bee it from vs to
lessen it by diuision. But let
vs reioyce when any saith,

though in some infirmitie,
Let vs goe vp to the house
of the Lord, to the Citie of
the liuing God.


17
God is one and immuta|ble,
so may we as certainely
know what he will be here|after,
as what he hath been
alreadie. Heretofore if men
feared him, they might bee
without all other feare, for
he was their Father, Defen|der
and Maintainer. This
hauing been tride, we say it
is certaine, and with as
much certaintie may wee
pronounce of the time to
come, that if we feare him,
he will also to vs be a merci|full
God. Let vs not ther|fore
doubt any change in
him, but in our selues; and

striuing by all holy conten|tion,
praier, fasting aud wat|ching,
to keepe our selues
stedfast toward him, let vs
assure our selues, that hee is
the Rocke immoueable,
whom we shall euer find in
one and the same place.


18
If God commands vs to
doe a thing, and all world|ly
profits and pleasures
mustering themselues toge|ther,
like the kingdomes of
the world before Christ,
perswade the contrary, wee
must then winke with the
eie of flesh, and so not see, or
at least, not regard any of
them. But then looking
wide open with the eye of
faith, let vs stedfastly behold
God and his glory, remem|bring

our dutie to him, our
couenant with him, our
happinesse in him. If thus
we can guide the eie of our
soule, that it looke on the
things eternall which are
not seene, and not vpon the
things temporall, which
may be seene, we shall be al|lured
forward toward that
Kingdome of rest, where
our hope is fixed, and wee
shal passe along as pilgrims,
through this world of lusts,
vnhurt and vnhindred by
them.


19
Christ as he tooke flesh
of the Virgin, so was he the
sonne of Adam, which hee
was, to bee subiect to the
Law laid on Adam; that by
subiection to it, hee might

fulfill and satisfie it. But
Christ as he was begotten
of God, and one with the
second person, so was he an
Adam himselfe, euen a fa|ther
of mankinde, by a new
kinde of generation; and
the first Adam from whom
Christ came, must by Christ
be begotten if he will liue
in the new world, euen the
new heauens, and the new
earth. Thus wee see two
rootes of generation, one
carnall another spirituall,
one ingendring to bon|dage
and death, another to
life and happinesse. Wee
must pray to the great Hus|bandman,
that hee will cut
vs off from the first roote,
and ingraffe vs into the se|cond;
for he that commeth

after, is preferred before, for
he was before. Then are we
translated from death to
life, then are we Citizens of
the new Ierusalem, wee are
passed from the old things
which must be blotted out,
and are come into the new
world, which abideth for e|uer.
Where bee now these
pedegrees from Adam, and
the sonnes of Adam with
their swelling glory? They
often come forth to amate
Gods children of low de|gree,
yet are these the pede|grees
of death, they prooue
their owners to be the glo|rious
sonnes of sinne and
mortalitie. But, O the in|finite
happinesse, and pri|uiledge
of the sons of God,
borne of the best Father, in

the best image, to the best
inheritance! God their Fa|ther
begets them to his
owne image, and becomes
their inheritance, in whom
is the fulnesse of glory, be|yond
whome is nothing,
and therfore nothing to be
sought beyond him. Let vs
in comparison of this new
birth and life, despise the
glory of earthly birth, and
earthly life, not as if we had
neither eminence of birth,
nor pleasures of life, (which
perchance was a reason to
Philosophers, but must not
be to Christians and to ma|ny
it needs not) but because
they are grosse, miserable,
and base in respect of the
other. For this cause let vs
especially dote on our hea|uenly

pedegree, and celesti|all
happinesse, growing still
stronger in loue with hea|uen,
as we grow nearer vn|to
it. Let vs refuse to be cal|led
the sonnes of Pharaohs
daughter, in respect of be|ing
the sonnes of Pharaohs
Creator. And though this
descent and inheritance be
inuisible, yet therefore are
they the better; for that
which may be seene, shall
vanish away, but that which
may not bee seene endures
for euer; that which may be
seene, is grosse, but that
which may not be seene is
pure and glorious, and only
discernable by a glorified
sight.


20
Gods time and our time

are often different; but
surely he that is wisest, ap|pointeth
the fittest times.
Accordingly, God who is
wisedome, giueth both
meate and all things in due
season. Let vs therfore with
patience surre~der our selues
vp to him in all our necessi|ties,
suffering willingly his
time, to be ours. For he will
come though he seeme to
tarry, and that in the fittest
time, (Luk. 18.) his com|ming
being quicke enough
in his iudgement, when
sometimes it seemes slow
to ours.


21
The children of Anak
and Achitophel, out of the
acknowledgement of their
owne strength, and cun|ning,

thinke that if God
would haue any seruants,
he would chuse such able
men as themselues, and not
the meaner sort whome
they despise with the Phari|sies,
saying; Doth any of the
Pharisies beleeue in him,
but this base people which
is accursed? Againe, they
are perswaded, that if God
would not finde out them,
they could finde out God,
sooner then the simple
swaine, that beleeues, as
they thinke, only out of a
low spirited feare. But let
them know, that the more
earthen the vessell is, the
more is the glory of him,
that doth great workes in
it. For the basenesse of the
vessell puts away all the

glory from it selfe, vnto
God. Therefore according
to Gods speech of Gideons
armie; They are too many
for me, to ouercome Midi|an
by them, wee may say
of these iolly men: They
are too good for God to
worke his glory by them:
yet humility acknowledg|ing
all sufficiency to bee
from God, and to bee no|thing
without him, might
take them downe, and so
make them fit for God. But
as for the finding of God in
Christ without his owne
light, surely they may as
well finde the Sunne in the
night, and the secrets of the
spirit of man, when the
man himselfe is silent. God
must shine, if hee will bee

seene; he must both tell his
secrets, and giue an vnder|standing
to conceiue them,
if man shall receiue them.
As no man can see God 
liue, so no naturall man can
see Christ who is God, as
long as he liues a meere na|turall
man. He must dy; and
especially to his owne wise|dome;
and his very sight,
which hee magnifies, for
clearnes, must be acknow|ledged
for blindnesse, and
be brought to be cured by
the lightsome Spirit of
Christ, which then will
shew him from whome it
selfe proceeded.


22
We are gods, and not our
owne; so are our children,
by creation, if not by sea|ling.

Why should we doubt
that God will not prouide
for his owne, and in this
doubt seeke to piece out
his prouidence, with a di|strustfull
prouidence of our
owne, which indeed at the
best, is but a shrid of his.
Surely our selues and our
children, being more his
then ours, and his loue to
his owne, being purer, and
wiser then ours, we might
rest well contented with
that portion which is gran|ted
by him, to our lawfull
endeauours. For the hea|uenly
Father, giueth good,
yea the best gifts though
the earthly fathers would
faine sometimes giue grea|ter
ones. But the greatnesse
which the earthly desire, is

earthly, but the good
(which also is great) that
the heauenly giues, is hea|ue~ly;
And this God knows
to be a substantiall blessing,
for it is blessednesse it selfe,
stretching beyond time,
 reaching in place aboue
moth and rust. Be we then
thankesgiuers,  not mur|murers,
when wee or our
children, haue store of
grace, though with little
wealth; for we are then ve|ry
rich in the true treasure,
though not in the vanish|ing;
and our Father hath
prouided for vs many ci|ties,
and a large inheritance
(Luk. 19. 17.) in the land of
the liuing.


23
The Scripture hath au|thority,

 selfe-vpholding
in it selfe, because it is the
word of God; and this it
hath, and is, whether men
receiue it or not. Truth is
as much truth whe~ it is not
acknowledged, as when it
is. But the true manner of
receiuing it is this. At first
the Church inlightned by
Gods Spirit, saw  beheld
in it the truth of God, recei|ued
it, and commended it
to all to be beleeued. Now
the learners of Christia|nity,
receiue it first on this
commendation of the
Church, before by it they
receiue the Spirit to dis|cerne
it; As children be|leeue
rules giuen by their
Masters vpon trust, before
that by the rules, they come

to the knowledge that they
are right rules. But after ha|uing
beene inlightned by
the Spirit, they receiue it
then, vpo~ their own know|ledge,
as the first Church
did. And thus proceeding
they come at last to iudge
the Church it selfe, by that
word, which before they
receiued from the Church.
So while I am a naturall
man, I receiue the word of
men; but when I become a
spirituall man, which discer|neth
all things, I then dis|cerne
it to be the word by
the Spirit. And the beleefe
which comes from this spi|rituall
discerning, is truly
and onely faith, the former
is only credence and trust;
the one hath the very

word for the obiect there|of,
the other, the persons of
men. Now miserable is the
estate of that Church that
hedgeth in men within that
trust, and neuer doth suffer
them, or at least incourage
them to proceede to faith.
Where it is taught that it is
sufficient to beleeue the
Church, there mans minde
is perswaded to rest in that
beleefe, and careth not to
beleeue the word for it
selfe. Such a perswasion
fastneth the eye on men,
and turneth it from the
word of light which giueth
light to the simple, and
might, and would be seene
it selfe. Indeede it is an ex|cellent
couer for a bad Re|ligion,
for it keepes men

within the pale of securitie
since they must aske their
teachers only whether their
teachers bee deceiued. By
the same rule may the Al|coran
also be established, or
any the most pestilent He|risie,
if men must bee boun|ded
by their teachers, and
not looke beyond their
teaching. But farre more
blessed are they, if they be
also blessed with thankful|nesse,
who may looke Di|uine
truth in the face, and
loue it for the beauty
which themselues behold
in it. And as men haue hap|pinesse
hereby, so hath God
his glory, who scorneth that
his word should haue men
to giue their word for it. It
is a word that standeth by

it selfe, it approoueth it selfe.
And lest men should say,
that the former trust helpes
the weakenesse of men, and
not of the word; they shold
know, that God hath taken
course himselfe, that man
should not still continue in
such a weaknesse, that still
might neede such helpe.
For as he giues the word to
shine from without, so hee
giues his Spirit to shine
within, that the light of the
Spirit might apprehend the
light of the word. Let vs
not therefore forsake this
inuincible rocke of Chri|stian
religion, euen a self-ap|prouing,
and selfe-establish|ing
authority of the word.
For as hreby it is strong in it
own strength,  so beareth

it selfe vnmoueable, against
all exception, so herein it
excelleth all errors and he|resies,
since none of them
can stand in their own pow|er.
Bee this then the priui|ledge
of the word, neuer to
be lost.


24
There are in man natu+rally,
three knowledges of
good and euill: one of rea|son,
which is true, as farre as
reason guides it. Another
of instinct, imprinted into
the nature of man at his
creation; such a knowledge
thinks it good to loue our
children, to relieue the di|stressed,
and thinks the con|trarie
euill. Hereto is ioy|ned
that naturall affection,
which Paul commends,

Rom. 1. but in this some|times
is excesse, sometimes
defect; and therfore it must
be aduanced or lessened, as
the measure of reason re|quires.
A third is of lust,
and somtimes called by vs
humour, which esteemes
things good or euill, out of
some blind affection, not
for any reason or iust cause.
So some loue killing, and
hate mercy, some loue
trouble, and hate quietnes,
some loue nothing but
wealth, some vtterly neg|lect
it, some thinke fame
to be good, and honestie
foolishnesse. This came
with the fall, and hereof we
must take heed in all our
actions: for this is that dark|nesse,
which brings foorth

the workes of darknes, and
leades to eternall darknes.


25
The things of the next
world, are as certaine as
these heere: for the same
word that said, Let these be,
and they were; saith also,
There are such incompre|hensible
things prepared
for them that loue God.
They are as certainely
known by faith, as these by
sight; as truly, though not
so largely. For Moses saw
them certainely; else per|chance
for them would he
not haue forsaken the cer|taine
pleasures of sin. And
the Word saith, that his
faith truly saw God; and no
one true thing, is more true,
then another. Againe, the

things inuisible, are certain|ly
better then the visible:
for holy men haue euer de|spised
the present for those
to come. The hart can con|ceiue
temporall things, but
not eternal; and that which
is of God, is infinitely infe|rior
to God himselfe. But
what is the reason then that
we chuse them not, being
certainly knowne, and farre
better? The reason is, be|cause
our station is natural,
elementarie and grosse, and
likenesse makes loue onely
to like. Therefore also the
things aboue being super|natural
and pure, must haue
a minde of like temper to
loue them. There must be
a new station, a second
worke, euen stinting and

crossing nature. Yea, wee
must haue a minde lifted a|boue
nature, to loue things
aboue nature, wee must bee
raised aboue flesh into an
heauenly knowledge, to see
heauenly truth, not sinking
with beasts into the low re|gion
of seeing, touching,
and tasting. Thus lifted vp
and made spirituall, we shal
discerne and approue spiri|tuall
things, as the naturall
man doth the obiects of na|ture.
Therefore let vs im|portune
God, the Father of
this better nature, that hee
will distill into vs some
drops of that heaue~ly dew,
which may giue vs heauen|ly
mindes, and make vs to
loue the things of heauen,
as much as flesh and blood

doth things of earth. Surely
vntill then, the wise Natu|ralist,
thinks happinesse fol|ly;
and then the spirituall
man demonstrably seeth
and prooueth all present
things to bee vaine vanitie.
Vntil then we are but great
children, or brute beasts
concluded vnder the sen|ses;
and we then onely are
men, whe~ we get the image
of God our Father, which
both knowes him, and is
knowne of him. Such were
they whom God made at
first,  such are they whom
God now makes againe.


26
If euery thing bee desira|ble
according to the bene|fit
thereof, then either pro|speritie
or aduersity may be

loued, and neither determi|nately
hated or co~demned.
For either is very profitable
to a man, and most com|monly,
aduersitie. Let vs
therefore cease to despise it
in others, or impatiently to
beare it in our selues, since
aduersitie hath whipt many
to heauen, when prosperity
hath coached more to hell.
Let vs leaue off, with chil|dren
onely to desire plea|sant
things, and growne in|to
men in Christ, let vs de|sire
wholesome things. It is
better in good sadnesse to
be saued, then in good fel|lowship
to be damned.


27
The Church truely and
rightly calleth God her sal|uation.
By God is not one

person only meant, but the
whole three persons. For
God the Father, through
his Son, by the holy Ghost,
saueth vs. God the Father,
principally out of a funda|mentall
loue elected vs, ap|pointed
 gaue the means,
by which this election
might produce saluation.
God the Sonne princi|pally
did put himselfe into
the very work of our salua|tion,
and became the maine
matter, meanes and treasu|rie
thereof. God the holy
Ghost principally distribu|teth
and imparteth by par|ticular
gift and application,
the saluation, which was
fore-ordained by the Fa|ther,
and is treasured vp in
the Sonne. So the whole

Trinitie ioyneth together
in this our happinesse, it be|ing
absolutely necessarie
toward our saluation, that
there should be an election
and appointment of the
meanes, an actuall exhibiti|on
of the meanes appoin|ted,
and an actuall applica|tion
of the meanes exhibi|ted.
Therefore when wee
say, we are saued by Christ,
we meane not, that wee are
saued by the second person
onely, and the humane na|ture
vnited to him: but with
Saint Paul we meane, that
whole God was in Christ,
and reconciled the world to
himselfe. Accordingly in
our due thanksgiuings, whe~
we praise God for his gifts
toward the new life, we as|cribe

glory to him for our
Election, for our Iustifica|tion,
for our Regeneration,
which are the maine works
of our saluation, and are the
ioynt-workes of the vndi|uided
Trinitie. But yet we
can follow this truth no
farder, then it goes before
vs. Therfore when we come
to regeneration, there must
we stop and looke no fur|ther
for saluation, for there|in
is our saluation accom|plished,
and all the parts
thereof perfected. If after
we will goe on to workes as
to further causes of our sal|uation,
we goe beyond the
truth, being past the God-head,
and come vnto man.
For though it may be said,
that God worketh these

workes in man, yet man
ioyneth therein with God.
Now the saluation of man
is deriued into man from
God alone, and is then ab|solute
and full in parts, whe~
Election, Iustification, and
Regeneration, the absolute
and only workes of the
Trinity, haue wrought vp|on
him. For regeneration
hauing put into man, the
seede of God which is the
seede of life; Man is then
translated from death to
life; and hauing begotten
him the Sonne of God, hee
is then the heire of promi|sed
glory and eternitie. In|deed
works comming after
the state and right of life
and glorie, their goodnesse,
as it comes from God, so it

shall be rewarded by God,
increasing the degrees of
that glory, wherein before
we had an vndeniable pro|perty,
and title. Therefore
works adde not a new part
of saluation but only in|crease
the issues, and fruit
of a part formerly posses|sed.
Accordingly doth the
Diuine song of that rauish|ed
soule, orderly declare
Gods sauing of vs from our
enemies to goe before our
seruing of God, in holinesse
all the daies of our life: So
workes themselues are pla|ced,
as fruits of our saluati|on,
and therefore the glory
giuen to workes, is but as
the fruite of the fruite of
saluation. But why then
shall it be said; Come yee

blessed, for ye fed mee; and
blessed are they that keepe
the commandements, that
their right may bee in the
tree of Life; So that good
works seeme to iustifie and
saue in the day of iudge|ment.
Herein comparisons
may inlighten, though not
prooue. If a man haue a
wife of a suspected life,
whose many children when
the dying husband calleth
before him, hee saith to
those that liuely represent
him; Come to mee the true
sonnes of Mee your Father,
you truely resemble mee,
therefore to you shall bee
giuen the inheritance of
your Father. Here for their
countenance and propor|tion
is the inheritance ad|iudged

to them, yet is it not
for that indeed giuen them,
but because thereby they
are iudged to be sonnes, for
which Son-ship, the inheri|tance
is verily giuen them.
So doth God in his great
iudgement, he will iudge
men to bee his sonnes by
their good workes, it being
impossible that good works
can come from any cause
but Regeneration, and for
the regenerate sonnes, was
the kingdome of glorie
long agone prepared euen
by that election which was
before the world. So the
word, For, doth not still im|ply
the cause it selfe, but
sometimes an inseparable
signe annexed to the cause,
as if it should be said: My

sonnes are heires of my
kingdome,  those which
are my sonnes, and they
only bring forth the works
of loue; these workes haue
I seene in you, therefore do
I acknowledge you to bee
my sonnes, enter into your
Fathers ioy.


28
There are two things
without in the word, which
witnesse it to bee excellent
aboue nature; A supernatu|rall
truth, and a supernatu|rall
holinesse; There are al|so
two supernaturall things
within a Christian, which
ioyne their inward witnes|sing
to the outward; A su|pernaturall
inlightning, to
acknowledge, and beleeue
this truth; and a supernatu|rall

vertue changing the
will into a conformity with
this holinesse. So in the
mouth of many witnesses
standeth firme the truth of
diuine truth.


29
Man and the earth are
growne wilde by the fall of
Adam, both bring foorth
weedes of their owne na|ture.
But as the earth is cu|red
by husbandrie  good
seed, so by the regeneration
of Christ the chiefe hus|bandman,
and the seede of
the word, man is brought
into a fruitfull nature, and
hath a remedy for the first
Adam by the last. Blessed
be the word which is God,
and reuerenced and desired
be the word of that Word

which is of God, for of them
is our life and health.


30
As a man in his first con|uersion
yeelded himselfe
into a generall submission
vnto the spirit, so must hee
doe in euery particular acti|on;
and then most resolute|ly
when sin tempteth most
strongly our selues. Wee
made our couenant at first
for the whole, and continu|ally
we must performe the
parts of the promised
whole. When we gaue our
selues to the spirit, of dead
branches to be made liuely
branches, withall inclusiue|ly,
we gaue our selues to
bring forth the continuall
fruite of liuing branches;
which is done by a conti|nuall

sucking of life from
the spirit which quickneth
vs. Now if we rest conten|ted
onely with our first in|grafting,
though the Al|mightinesse
of him whose
seed is immortall, and who
wil not faile of his end, may
preserue vs aliue, yet do we
what wee may to kill our
selues, and to falsifie our co|uenant
with him: who
therefore beeing offended
will chastise vs with tem|porall
iudgements, and de|sertions,
and will shew that
when hee is angry he is a
consuming fire. But let the
true sonnes keepe neere to
their father, let them keepe
close to his spirit, moouing
at euery motion of it, and
filling the wants in their

Lampes with the continu|all
oyle thereof; for this spi|rit
is our very life and the
witnesse thereof; By our ge|nerall
resignation this life
entred, and by particular re|signation
this life increa|seth;
so the more we sow to
this spirit, the more we shal
reape of life eternal. Again,
as a ma~ in his great  main
conuersion from a sinner 
guilty, to a sanctified and iu|stified
man, goeth ouer him|self
in general with y^t iudge|ment
of the Law, whereby
finding himselfe a man of
death, he flieth vnto Christ,
who baptizeth him from
his guilt, and sinfulnesse by
his Bloud and Spirit; giuing
both his actuall righteous|nes;
and the spirits habitual

righteousnesse; so after the
committing of euery parti|cular
sin, we shold go ouer it
with a particular iudgment
of y^e Law, wherby acknow|ledging
it to be a worke of
death, wee should flie to a
particular applicatio~ of the
great Baptisme: that so put|ting
away the particular
guilt of that sinne by the
washing of Christs blood,
and the particular vnclean|nesse
of that sinne by the
washing of Christs Spirit,
we which before were gene+rally
clensed and iustified,
may also haue a particular
and continual clensing and
iustification. For our in|ward
and outward Bap|tisme
though at once per|formed,
is of continual vse,

and daily wee must haue a
recourse thereto (to wit by
the outward remembring
and passing to the inward)
that the stocke of iustifica|tion,
and sanctification at
first imparted may be daily
applied, and distributed to
our particular necessities.
And thogh being in Christ
we haue in him iustification
and sanctification, yet God
expecteth wee shall not let
either of them shift for it
selfe, and to worke on vs,
not working therwith. But
hee looketh that daily sin|ning
against him, we should
daily offer vp to him the iu|stificatio~
of Christ to purge
away the guilt of sinne; and
daily request of him the
Spirit of sanctification, and

the increase thereof to
purge away the defiling of
sin. Thus doing we keepe
our selues in co~tinuall pure|nesse,
and to be pure wee
must do thus; And because
the latter is most painfull
but absolutely necessary, we
must giue great heede ther|to.
For all sinne leauing on
vs guilt, and a staine, the
guilt is not ordinarily for|giuen
except the staine bee
taken away; therefore as oft
as we would be forgiuen of
the guilt by Christs bloud,
let vs aske Christs Spirit to
wash away the spot contra|cted
by sinne. When Dauid
will hopefully pray to bee
deliuered from bloud-guil|tinesse,
hee must pray also,
Create in me a cleane hart,

and renew a right spirit in
me. Thus must the sonnes
and daughters of God put
away euery vncleannesse
from among them, beeing
perfect in their purposes
and endeauours, as their
heauenly Father is perfect.
And when they intreate
this Spirit to clense the ble|mish
of their soule, they
must doe it with a submissi|on
to the spirit, to be whol|ly
guided  changed ther|by,
and particularly to haue
that very sin slaine, which
before defiled them; that
the spirit may be as it were
reuenged on the sin which
grieued it, and that it may
be restored to the true place
and power thereof, euen of
raigning  dominion ouer

vs and our sinfull lusts;
from which it was degra|ded
by that rebellious sin|ner,
which therefore must
now bee subiected and cast
downe vnder it.


31
Death in respect of this
life seemeth to bee a great
euill, because it is an end of
life, and of all the pleasures
thereof. But the same death
is rather a most excellent
benefit which putteth vs
out of this life subiect to e|uill,
and whose natural hap|pinesse
is in the creature, in|to
an eternall life beyond
the reach of euill, whose
happinesse is the enioying
of the infinite fulnes of the
Creator, in whom the good|nesse
of the creature is also

included. Therefore death
is a gate, whose neare side,
though it seeme couered
with blacknesse, yet the in|ner
side is couered with
shining gold, and the purest
light hath her dwelling
there. Let vs therefore with
the holy men of God by
faith, looke to the farther
side of this partition, let vs
pierce beyond darknes vn|to
light, beyond the shade
vnto glorie, not sticking al|together
with the blind
multitude on the darknes,
which is on this side, as
bounded therewith. Then
with Paul shall we crie to be
dissolued to be with Christ,
wee shall so admire the in|side,
that wee shall despise
the outside; wee shall with

the holy Martyrs  Saints
push at this gate, saying, O|pen
the euerlasting doores,
that wee may enter in vnto
the King of glorie. Besides,
if wee will looke from our
selues to other creatures,
wormes, birds and cattell
die for the profit of men,
yea for their pleasure; yet
man created them not, nei|ther
can claime any right
to this power of their liues,
but by gift. But God by cre|ation
hath a right to man,
and for his glorie hath ap|pointed
man to die, which
oweth infinitely more to
God, then the creatures to
man: yet man is loth to do
that for God, which with|out
feeling he will haue the
beasts doe for him. But, O

man, yeeld to thy Maker,
be thou for him, who hath
made the beasts for thee,
and therefore himselfe.
Breake not this appointed
order: thou hast this additi|on
of comfort, thou goest
to happinesse when thou
diest, and so God doth not
kill thee, but call for thee.
He takes thee not from be|ing,
but alters thy being,
and makes it better; follow
him gladly therfore, remo|uing
thee to blisse: and the
Law which thou willingly
allowest on the creature to
his extinguishment, allow
also vpon thy selfe for thy
aduantage. But if thou wilt
not yet away, thou must,
thou maist lose the bene|fit
which might be made of

it, but escape thou canst
not; the decree of heauen
must stand in despight of
thee; and to conforme our
selues to it, is our chiefe wis|dome
and ease.


32
Many things are trou|blesome
and full of worke;
one thing is easie, readie
and mannageable. Many
things can tend no farther
then this world, which ten|deth
but to vanitie and cor|ruption;
one thing tendeth
to eternitie, and to happi|nesse
in eternitie. Againe,
these many things leading
to vanity, hinder much that
one thing which leadeth to
eternall felicitie. Let men
therefore chuse that one
which is easie, and rewar|deth

with happines, rather
then the many which com|ber
vs, only for vanitie.
But especially let them be|ware,
that with those many
things of vanitie they com|ber
and hinder not that one
thing of felicitie. Let them
beware, that with temporal
trouble, they purchase not
trouble eternall; and so take
paines neuer to bee out of
trouble. Many there are,
who haue a smoking flaxe
of religion in them, and am|bition
or couetousnesse al|lureth
them to put into
their harts, the many things
which are combersome,
thinking still to retaine
roome for that one thing
which is necessarie. But by
little and little the many

things so possesse the heart,
that the one thing is thron|ged
out, and the smoke
which might haue been a
fire, is no longer a smoke.
Thus doe they kill the spi|rituall
life which began in
them, and with many cares
buy death eternall. But pit|tie
your selues, O ye sons of
Adam; know your strength,
and take heed you sell not
your soules for the whole
world. Some indeed haue a
greater force and dispatch
to turne ouer many world|ly
businesses, but take heed
thou ouerlay it not. Some
are weake, and a little ouer|throweth
them. Let not
a horse vndertake the bur|then
of a Camell, and let
neither goe beyond his

strength: the surest way is,
to bee faultie (if on any
side) on the best, and su|rest
side; therefore bee sure
thou allow enough to that
one thing which is necessa|rie,
though thou abridge
and lessen those many
things, which are trouble|some
and transitorie. But if
thou fillest and ladest thy
selfe with care, thou becom|mest
indeed a Camell, euen
a beast of burden, thou canst
not goe through the eye of
the needle, thou hast too
much about thee, to goe in
at the straight gate of the
Kingdome of heauen.


33
Mankind hath rooted in
it a facultie, or rather an im|potencie
of desiring, which

cleaueth fast to him through
his whole life. Whatsoeuer
outward changes befall, or
whatsoeuer prosperity with+out
change, there is a roote
of lust and desire in man,
which still will bud foorth;
and if it fasten on nothing
to be desired, it is in paine,
and desireth earnestly to
desire something. The rea|son
of this, is the saying of
Christ, That which is born
of flesh is flesh: to wit, that
which is borne of fleshly
lust, is lustfull flesh, the ef|fect
is like the cause. Hence
are those endlesse desires,
which are euer reaching,
though without need, with
out vse. Hence it is, that the
man who is ignorant of his
owne nature, so often de|ceiueth

himselfe, while as
often hee telleth himselfe,
that such a thing had, hee
will leaue desiring. For e|uen
after that had, hee de|sires
afresh, and on that ve|rie
thing ofttimes whereby
hee thought to bound the
old, he raiseth a new desire:
the whiles hee perceiueth
not, that himselfe is still the
cause of his desires, and not
the obiects; so that whiles
he is himselfe, hee shall still
desire: Indeed when a thing
desired is enioyed, the de|sire
seemeth to cease, and
then man thinkes hee will
desire no more. But that is
but one single desire, which
ceaseth by the obtaining of
that his obiect, the power
of desiring still remaineth

vnslaine, and is no more ta|ken
away, then a roote by
the breaking of a single
branch; therefore it still
newly buddeth out, and
makes endlesse worke, vp|on
the ende of one desire,
sending foorth a new. But
what remedie is there to
this euill? Surely we must
not run so much to obiects
thereby to satisfie and quiet
desires, which is endlesse;
as to our selues, to kill them
all in the roote. But this e|uill
cleaueth so fast to man,
that except man can be vn|twined
fro~ himself (which
is also very hard) it seemes
impossible to bee cleared.
And this very thing that
is impossible to man, is
possible to God, and done

by God. He by regenerati|on
putteth a new man
into vs, which eateth
out the old man corrupt
through these deceiuea|ble
lusts. This new man
teacheth and mooueth vs
to denie the lusts which
fight against the soule. It
changeth vs and our na|ture,
and makes vs dead vn|to
lusts, and aliue vnto
truth and reason. Therfore
if wee will bee at rest in our
selues, and keepe a perpetu|all
Sabbath in our soules,
let vs pray for this godly
nature vnto God the father
of it, which may free vs
from this slauerie of lust,
(that like the Egiptian bon|dage
still sends vs about to
seeke worke for our selues)

and may put into vs holy,
reasonable, and measured
desires. Let vs giue our
selues wholly to be led by
the light and motion ther|of,
taking no care to fulfill
the vnlimited lusts of the
flesh; And surely this world
of vanitie is not worth a
long or large desire, neither
is the lustfull desire of any
thing, more then a sicke|nesse
 labor of the mind,
and no helpe to the thing
desired.


34
As a man Regenerate
hath two natures in him, so
haue te~porall euils which
fall on him, two natures
and effects instilled into
them from the former two.
For first by the old man

they haue a taste wholly
bitter put vpon them; they
are to it proposed and be|held
as punishments, euen
the strokes of God hating
and afflicting. This made
many holy men cry out in
their agonies that God ha|ted
them, that hee did set
them as Markes, that they
were borne vnto sorrow
and darkenes. But the god|ly
nature which wee haue
from Christ, touching these
afflictions when they touch
vs, turnes them as the wa|ters
of Marah into whole|some
sustenance, yea into
medicines; For Christ is a|ctiue
euen vpon his passi|ons,
both in himselfe and
his members. And as all
such troubles are sanctified

by the touch thereof, so
doth the same nature in|wardly
teach vs that these
chastiseme~ts are the strokes
of a louing Father:  with|all
it so comforteth and as|swageth
our soules with the
oyles therof, that we reioice
amid tribulatio~s:  among
the complaints of the old
man, there often breake
forth pangs of ioy sent
from this holy and blessed
nature, as wee finde in the
writings of the Prophets.
Let vs therefore in our suf|ferings
not so much looke
to the outward shew of
temporall euils, but goe in|wardly
into that temple of
ours where the holy Spirit
dwelleth, and there let vs
aske aduice of it,  inquire

what they are; This Spirit
will answer vs with com|fort,
that they are blessings,
that they are blessed to vs,
that they cure vs, beeing
heauenly exercises imposed
to suppresse our corrupti|on,
to keepe our new man
actiue and able,  to make
him bring forth the fruite
of patience, and righteous|nesse.
And if we hearken
with beleefe and rest to the
spirit thus informing vs, we
shall see the promised ef|fects,
euen increase of san|ctification
and glorificati|on.


35
Most rightly doth the
wisedome  grace of God
informe vs against lust,
which is the maine roote

of sinne, a mistresse of folly,
 an inuenter of torments.
It is still begetting of sinne,
for still it setteth vs either a|gainst
God, or holdeth vs
from him, by committing
euill, and omitting good; it
wrappeth vs in continuall
folly, for it selfe is blindnes
and possessing the vnder|standing
neither seeth it
self, neither suffers it to see.
Accordingly it imployes
man in many endlesse, vn|profitable
yea impossible
proiects, which condemne
the man that laboureth in
them of a darke and decei|ued
iudgement, and with|all
punisheth him for it; It
filleth our life with tor|ments,
for whereas enioy|ing,
is the comfort  chiefe

portion out of this life, lusts
neuer suffer men to enioy,
or at least not long, but sets
him still on new worke, and
spurres him vnto new tra|uailes.
It tells the minde
that which thou hast is no|thing,
except thou haue
some other addition  in|crease:
that which thou art
is nothing, except thou
some way increase it thy
selfe. So is the soule still dri|uen
from her rest,  made
a Lackey to trudge on the
businesses of lust; Amidst
which trauailes she meetes
with many crosses, feares,
griefes, which like theeues
and wilde beasts stand rea|die
for them which go that
dangerous way; how much
better were it for the soule

to cut it selfe off by diuine
circumcision from this ac|cursed
lust, and to ioyne it
selfe to grace, the contrarie
and remedie thereof? For
grace will draw vs nearer to
God our happinesse, it will
make vs to rest in God, and
by conforming vs to him
will both please him and
blesse vs: it will be a light to
our soules, euen a day-starre
in our hearts, shewing vs
waies right profitable and
possible; it will ease vs from
many harsh and laborious
seruices, teaching vs to be|leeue,
that it is farre better
to walke in the sight of the
eye, then in the lusts of the
flesh.

There are many consi|derations

which would al|lay
the swelling of Ambiti|on,
if they were as duely ap|plyed
to it by reason as glo|rious
obiects are to it by
corrupted nature. Now
since with naturall men, na|turall
thoughts fit best, let
vs talke with them in their
owne language. It is a con|fessed
thing by all that vn|derstand
this life, that en|ioying
is the height  vt|most
of life, and the more
solide and hearty inioying,
the higher is that height.
This being chiefest, to that
should the minde chiefely
aspire; for if it goe to that
which seemes higher, but
is not, it sells substance for
shadow, and being, for see|ming.
Now if we inquire in

what estate this enioying is
greatest, we shall finde in
that wherein naturall, and
as we terme them, kindly
affections, and desires, haue
most satisfaction. For in|deede
what comparison is
their betweene the imagi|nation
of being pointed at
for greatnesse, and the so|lide
sweetnesse of being lo|ued
of a wise and honest
friend? What comparison
betweene the officious and
hartles complements of ser|uice-offring-flatterers,
and
the obsequious loue of a
chaste wife, and dutifull
children? what equality be|tweene
the delicate inuita|tions
of a dainty feast vnto
a cloyed stomacke, and the
sweetnes of plaine fare to a

naturall appetite, which de|sireth
it not beeing desired
of it. If these be the better
comforts of life, and that
life is better which hath
most of them, then in a
meane degree and not still
in the greater is the best
portion of life. Therefore
it is not amisse for men
sometimes to aspire down|wards
euen to the conditi|ons
of an estate beneath
them selues. This I set forth
not as perswading an vni|uersall
priuatenesse (which
as mans ouer-spreading
ambition will euer make
impossible, so it needeth
not) but only in a publike
fortune to carry a priuate
minde not swilling in too
generall and large desires,

but bounded within natu|rall,
and becomming affe|ctions.
And this, not to
make a heauen of it on
earth, as the Philosopher
in vaine assayed, in a world
so throughly tempered and
seasoned with misery; but
to draw men vpon pro|fitable
and aduantageable
termes into the most quiet
and orderly compasse of
life; that the order and qui|etnesse
thereof might allow
roome for the practise of
some course profitable to
the Commonwealth, and
especially to the contem|plation
of a better life. For
these are too much put out
of minde by swolne Ambi|tion;
that oft so takes vp
the whole heart, that it

thrusts this present life, the
countrey wherein life was
receiued, and that country
where only true life and
happinesse shall bee, be|yond
all care and remem|brance.


37
The pleasures of this
world after they are past,
(and after they begin they
are going to be past) are as
much nothing as if they
had not beene. Therefore
whe~ sinfull pleasures tempt
vs, let vs thinke, that if we
by Religion put them not
from being, they will euen
by beeing put themselues
from being. Wherefore let
vs much rather choose, that
grace should make them to
bee nothing, and to per|forme

an acceptable worke
to God, which shal haue his
reward, then giue them
leaue by their owne nature
to bring themselues to the
same nothing, and yet to
leaue guilt behind, and ob|ligation
to punishment. But
if the mind will needs dote
on dying pleasantnesse, let
the same mind at that same
time know and beleeue the
pleasure of seeing Gods
face, infinitely to exceede
this both in quantitie and
in qualitie, and that it shall
as certainely appeare to vs
hereafter, as these doe now,
if wee refuse these for it.
There is no ods that may
disswade vs, but presentnes
of the one, and futurenesse
of the other; which being

againe vnmeasurablely o|uerwaied
by aduantage of
excellencie and eternitie,
should so mainely carry vs,
that we should despise the
presentnesse of all sinfull
pleasures, much more then
Iacob his next present seuen
yeeres libertie for Rachel; or
one that proueth masteries
his present ease and pleasure
for a corruptible crowne.


38
The affections of man
are vsefull and commenda|ble,
meeting with fit occasi|ons,
and limited by due
measure. But they are com|monly
inordinate among
vs, and lay hold on wrong
obiects, or on true in wrong
measure. Ioy is good, yea
necessarie, when Gods loue

is beheld and considered.
And ioy is good, when
Gods blessings are powred
vpon vs, for euen that ioy is
the gift of God: but ioy
oft transgresseth; for it re|ioyceth
more in the bles|sings,
then in God; and it is
too liuely in temporall
things, and too dull in eter|nall.
Yea, it reioyceth som|times
in sinne, our owne or
others, which is a ioy in the
place of sorrow. For sorrow,
though hated, is also very
profitable, and excellently
meete for the sinfull and
miserable estate of man.
Sinne, when it hath myred
the soule, by repentant
sorrow hath the filth,
(though not guilt) washed
away, and indeed the guilt

is not washed away by
Christ, vntill the filth bee
washed away by spirituall
sorrow. For as long as the
dregges of sinne lie on the
soule vnbathed in repen|tance:
so long the blood of
Christ, as it were, lotheth to
come neere it. Againe, sor|row
fitteth excellently the,
estate of vanity and misery,
that our looke being sad,
our heart may be made bet|ter;
and that griefe may
stirre vs vp to apply our
hearts to wisedome, where|by
wee may escape through
vanitie and misery, into im|mortalitie
and happinesse.
But sorrow is often faulty,
when it sorrowes more for
losses, then for sins; which
in effect is more for losses

of this life, then of life eter|nall.
It is faulty also, when
it is stubborne against spi|rituall
ioy, and will not let
the hart reioyce in the mer|cy
of God, though he bid it
reioyce continually; yea
hatred it selfe is good, yet in
one only cause, when it is a|gainst
men that hate God;
for then may we hate both
their wickednes, and them
as our vtter enemies. Yet
wee must beware wee hate
not men for some single
sinne, who otherwise striue
to liue vprightly; for in ma|ny
things we offend al, and
haue need our selues in such
cases often to be spared. To
such belongs the Spirit of
meekenes to restore them;
and if Dauid say, I haue sin|ned

against God, the Pro|phet
must say, Thy sinne is
also forgiuen thee. But the
habitual and greedy sinner,
that putteth God far from
him, and in defiance saith,
Who is the Lord; this man
is odious, and Iehosaphat
shall be bitterly chidden if
he loue them; yet the bond
of charitie may still hold
on, which must watch that
our hatred be for Gods sake
onely, and not our owne
(for man ought not to hate
man in his owne behalfe.)
Beside this, charitie must
pray for the amendment of
him; for charitie to man
desireth the preseruation,
not the destructio~ of man,
as farre as it may, without
offending the charitie of

God. But summarily to
bring all affections into
their true vse and proporti|on,
let vs finde out both
their vse and measure in the
word of light, kindling or
quenching them, lengthe|ning
or shortning them, ac|cording
to the direction
and line thereof.


39
The best knowledge hath
been anciently thought to
be mans knowledge of him|selfe:
but the best know|ledge
indeede being the
knowledge of the best,
which is God, the know|ledge
of man comes next
in worth, who is the next
best in this lower world,
and whom God knowne,
teacheth and commandeth

to know himselfe, and who
by knowing himselfe shall
the better know God. Now
the immediate vse of this
knowledge being to better
the knower, hee that will
make most vse therof, must
learne to know himselfe
most in those parts and fa|culties,
which are of most
vse and excellence. There|fore
on the soule, let the
soule of man especially fa|sten
her eies, that knowing
herself with a right and true
knowledge, she may finde
what is right in her, to con|tinue
and confirme it; and
which is crooked and cor|rupted,
to auoide  amend
it. But to do this clearely,
she hath need of some light
aboue her owne; for it is

hard for the blind soule to
see her owne blindnesse.
Therefore begging for that
eye-salue of the greatest
Light, and so hauing obtai|ned
it, let her goe on to a
true search and inquirie of
her selfe. In this inquirie,
let her generally compare
the resolutions of her vn|derstanding,
and the incli|nations
of her will, with the
lawes of her Maker. For see|ing
the soule did, and shold
beare the Image of God,
which Image, the lawes of
God truly and vnchangea|bly
expresse: it is a certaine
truth, that wherin the soule
differeth and boweth from
these lawes, in vnderstan|ding
or will; therein, and in
so much, the soule differeth

from God, and hath abated
and altered his Image. And
this is indeed a chiefe and
most worthy employment
of mans time on earth,
when the soule lookes into
Gods loue, as into a glasse,
and thereby trimmeth
and fitteth her selfe for her
Maker, against the day of
her appearance before his
glorious Selfe, who cannot
abide to see any thing neere
him that is vnlike him.
Now there are some par|cels
and remnants of this
Law, yet remaining of the
first writing in the nature
of man: but if we will reade
profitably therein, we must
take heed we follow it not
too farre, but still compare
it with the Law written, be|cause

there are but small
broken and corrupted pie|ces
thereof. While we are
in this search, as generalitie
and custome are great bin|ders
of the soule vnto error
and corruption, so a suspici|on
that a generall estimati|on
of things may proceede
from the vnderstanding de|ceiued,
or the will corrup|ted,
may be a great helpe to
bring the soule into her
place and true estate. For
to suspect deceit, is a first
and excellent degree to|ward
being vndeceiued; 
vnto this suspicion of mens
wisest and most esteemed
opinions, the word of truth
giueth vs a good foundati|on,
while it sayes, that ma|ny
things which are highly

esteemed among men, are a|bominable
in the sight of
God. And of this againe,
there is an vnfallible rea|son,
euen the corruptnesse
of the soule by the fall of
man. For this deprauation
mightily possessing the vn|derstanding,
makes it in the
best iudgement thereof, to
think deceitfully of things,
and withall to thinke these
deceiued thoughts wise, be|cause
it knoweth nothing
beyond them. But let the
soule that prepareth her
selfe for God, vntie her selfe
from her selfe, as from a
thing corrupted, and from
the world, as from a multi|tude
of such things as her
selfe is; equally blinded,
and walking in the same

darkenesse, though among
themselues they be agreed
to call it light. Thus putting
off her own corruption and
that of the world, shee is fit
and ready to be new stam|ped
with the image of her
Creator, and to be inlight|ned
with truth in her vn|derstanding,
and to put on
rightnesse in her wil, which
let her learne from the law,
and desire to haue ingrauen
in her by grace. In this
course there will bee many
Rubbs, the glorious folly
of the world will mocke
thy particular and desolate
wisedome, it will disswade
thee from singularity and
desire, or prouoke thee to
erre with company; it will
aske thee whether the ru|lers

doe beleeue as thou
doest; yea thine owne cor|ruption
will somtime strike
thee into astonishment, and
make thee muse and won|der
whether thou art in a
right minde and purpose.
But goe on vnchanged,
knowing that thou seekest
not what is vsuall, but what
is right, and the patterne to
which thou art fitting thy
selfe is not man but God;
euen a patterne of perfecti|on
beyond all exception.
This is also their duty if
they considered it. There|fore
let them that would
turne thee, returne to thee,
Returne not thou to them.
When thou shalt present
thy selfe before God, the
more holy and vnblame|able

thou art, the more ac|ceptable
shalt thou bee to
him, who wil not aske what
company came with thee,
but wil know and acknow|ledge
his sonnes by their
likenesse to him, and accor|dingly
reward them as that
is more or lesse;  then shal
it be no sorrow of heart to
thee, that thou hast gone
out of thy selfe, and the
world, to passe through
somewhat more vnsociably
into happinesse.


40
God is the iudge of the
world, and iudgeth it gene|rally
by two kinds of iudg|ment.
The first is by Depu|ties,
and so by Kings, Magi|strates
and Iudges, he iud|geth
mankinde. It is the

iudgement of God which
is committed to them, and
they are his mouth to the
people How wicked and
false are they then, that out
of the mouth of God giue
not the iudgement of God,
but of their owne corrupti|on!
that seeke not what
God iudgeth of the case,
but what themselues may
iudge, corruptly, if couert|ly.
These are in the ranke
of the old false Prophets,
which said the Lord saith,
when hee speaketh not by
them. Thou standest  cor|rupt
man, in the place of
God, to represent him, but
thou actest this part ill fa|uouredly,
and insteede of
representing the pure, and
by-bribes-vnflexible Lord

of the world, thou plaiest
the part of a base and rot|ten-harted
slaue; so doest
thou expresse thy owne
vice not his iustice, and wee
receiue that iudgement of
mony, not of God. Yet is
that indeede thy God, and
tells thee what sentence
thou shalt giue; and all this
is wisedome if concealed
from the eyes of men. But
euen for that point also
know this, that thogh thou
art only in that place depu|ted
to iudge, yet many o|thers,
particulars beeing
heard, ca~  do iudge as wel
as thy selfe: these see  feele
when the bias of couetous|nesse,
and corruptions, car|rie
thee from the straight
line of iustice; they feele

whe~ the iudge is some way
allyed to the cause,  hath
some feeling of it, because
hee or his haue felt some
thing for it; yea generally
they talke of it, though out
of hearing; for corruptnesse
though it haue no other
goodnesse, hath yet some
modestie, and is ashamed to
heare it selfe spoken of, for
it knoweth it selfe to bee a
vice: yet this is one more
vice of that vice, to rage
more against others that
reueale it, then against the
owner of it, that did such a
thing which might iustly
shame the Author of it, if
reuealed. Let such a one be
rather angry with himselfe
for doing ill, then with an|other,
for speaking truth.

But because through this
net of humane iustice and
deputatiue iudgement, ma|ny
guilty, if profitable of|fenders
breake out and e|scape,
God hath another
greater net which he casts
without these, wherein hee
takes both the escapers, and
the giuers of leaue to es|cape;
This is the great and
generall iudgement, where|in
God in person will sit as
iudge, and will examine the
iudges themselues and the
iudged. Then the righte|ous
Iudge of the world,
shall iustifie the iudges that
haue iudged righteously in
this world; But there they,
that now are wro~gfully iu|stified
shall iustly bee con|demned,
and the mooue|able

Iudges that missed
their part, and changing
iudgement, spake from the~|selues,
when they should
haue spoken fro~ God, shall
haue their faults repeated
vnto them, if vnrepeated;
and by the iust mouth of
God himselfe, shall with
their faults be deliuered to
Satan the iayler, who shall
carry them to the dunge|on,
where the worme dyeth
not, nor the fire goeth out.
But because such men doe
fortifie their consciences, a|gainst
the terrors of the
Lord, and his fearefully-great
iudgement, and put
the euill day either wholly
or farre from them; that
they bee not vtterly with|out
feare in this world, God

doth many times by parti|cular
iudgements strike, ei|ther
them, their issue, or
those whom they haue iu|stified
in offences; by which
particular stroakes on some
among many, he puts them
in minde that hee which
now iudgeth some, shall
hereafter iudge all sinne, be|ing
equally odious in all,
and equally lyable to iudg|ment.
Hee strikes not all,
yet, because generall iustice
is reserued for the generall
iudgement; But he strikes
some, that their iudgement
might to al be an earnest of
a generall iudgement, and
might in the meane time
terrifie men from wicked|nesse
by present plagues,
who feare not the future.



41
Moreouer; it is a great
motiue from sinne, the
shortnesse of the time be|tweene
sinne and punish|ment:
there is nothing but
life betweene them;  how|soeuer
we lengthen it in our
imagination to keepe vs
from feare of punishment,
yet if we consider it by the
most earnest and most tru|sted
iudgement, which is
that of the worldly wise, it is
therby valued but at seauen
yeares or thereabout; yet if
it be (as it is but with some)
a continuance of thirtie or
forty yeares, after thou
commest to thy full age
of wickednesse, aske the
worldling what hee thin|keth
of himselfe when hee

hath such a tearme in a li|uing.
He will by no meanes
think himself a setled man,
he will not much build vp|on
it, for hee holds it but a
short time, and is continu|ally
troubled that it weares
so fast  is so neere an end.
Surely the diuell hath a
great aduantage vpon vs
by this deceit of our flesh,
that it can tell vs truths in
many things when their vse
and end is earthly, but
tels vs falshoods in the same
things when their vse is
heauenly; it makes vs wise
for matters of this generati|on,
but not for those of the
Regeneration. But let vs,
where there is such a truth
so found, take the line from
the worldly things, and lay

it on the spirituall, then shal
we finde that grosly to ap|peare,
which before was
not perceiued, and so may
we deceiue the Diuell him|selfe,
his aduantage beeing
made ours. Accordingly let
vs take that life, wherewith
the wisedome of the world
doth measure life for world|ly
purposes, and lay it on
the same life for our spiri|tuall
vse: then shall we finde
that the sinfull pleasures of
life, are but pleasures for a
season,  that a short one,
and that there is but the
same short season betweene
pleasant sinne and eternall
punishments.


42
He that wil finde a good
friend let him seeke a good

Christian. For a Christian
is more then a man, and
hath the strength of God
added to the strength of
man: Christ the Rocke is
his foundation, and he will
stand the billowes, and beat
backe the tempests, for hee
is founded on a Rocke. But
the Moralist, and the Ro|mane
of these times, are but
flesh and blood, sand and
dust; therefore floods and
tempests wash him, and
blow him away. Wonder
not therfore my soule with
the world, neither take vp
the vsual complaints of the
deceiueable vncertaintie of
friends. Those that were
once true friends are still so,
those that are not, neuer
were. If they had been of

vs, they would haue conti|nued
with vs. If they had
been truly Christian, loue
would haue grown in them,
not decaied For it is a spe|ciall
businesse of a Christi|an
in this life to grow vp
vnto Christ in loue: but
their not continuing with
vs, shewes they were not of
vs: so they do vs not wrong,
but right by departing from
vs; for they rid vs of il com|pany,
and tell our iudge|me~t
the truth, which before
was deceiued in them. Yet
that wee deceiue our selues
no more, let vs fasten on
such no expectation: let vs
try the spirits, and if by true
experience we find a spirit
begotten of God, let vs take
him for that friend, which

is better then a meere bro|ther.
Thy heart and his
are one, and they will agree
in spight of the diuell;
though hee come against
them accompanied with
the flesh and the world; yea
if such two should bee stir|red
as Barnabas and Paul
euen vnto parting, being
parted, they would meete
in loue, and doe the offi|ces
of friendship each to o|ther,
vpon any occasion.
The heauenly loadestone,
euen Christs Spirit of loue
hath toucht them, therfore
though stirred, they returne
to their point, and still rest
in loue.


43
When Adam was crea|ted,
there was no corrupt

lust: when there was no such
lust, there was no shame;
generation was cleane, and
meerely pure: and when ge|neration
was pure, then the
neerest kindred could not
defile themselues with it,
for pure things defile not.
Therfore rightly God, who
had aboundance of Spirit,
made but one male and fe|male,
who could haue made
many more: for though
there were inforced there|by
an intermarriage be|tween
brethren and sisters,
yet thereby was inforced
no incest; for when mar|riage
and generation were
pure and without shame,
then the brother discoue|red
not the shame of his si|ster,
which is the wicked|nesse

and vnlawfulnesse of
incest. And thus might the
state of generation haue
continued in all posterities,
if the state of the creation
had continued: But man
by his fall brought in lust,
and thereby shame, and by
both a necessitie of incest,
which was not before. For
God made onely a necessi|tie,
that brethren and sisters
should purely and holily
marrie together: but man
turned this necessitated ma|riage
into incest. For a bro|ther
and a sister being one
flesh, it is a ground of na|ture,
that the same flesh
should couer the shame of
the same flesh; which hee
that doth not, goes so farre
toward incest, as hee goes

from this couering. Now
the children of Adam, being
brought by Adam into this
necessitie, were suffered by
the patience of the God of
long suffering, who might
still require his first course
well instituted, that now by
manis corrupted. After that
some of the Fathers may be
thought to haue done the
like by a spirituall necessi|tie,
that they might marry
within the Church, and not
with the daughters of men;
or by diuine indulgence
and dispensation, God be|ing
the Lord of nature, and
so able to change the lawes
of it, to giue what lawes he
list vnto it, much more to
require the law in which
first hee created man. But

for vs who neither are for|ced
by a naturall necessitie,
the world being filled with
multitude; nor with a spiri|tuall,
the multitude hauing
in them, though fewest, se|uen
thousand that bow not
to Baal; nor any dispensati|on
from God for it, but a
law of God against it: this
neere intermarriage is a
loathsome abomination in
the eies of God. It is a sinne
against nature, and so abo|minable
euen to mans first
and naturall apprehension.


44
The course of the chil|dren
of God through this
world vnto heauen, is the
very course of the Israelites
from Egypt to Canaan. Is|rael
is born in Egypt vnder

the seruice of Pharaoh, and
brought from vnder him
by a mightie and outstret|ched
Arme, escaping the
death of Egypt by the
blood of the Lamb. Gods
children are begotten in the
Kingdome of Satan, and
drawne from his subiection
by his mighty power, who
can onely bind the strong
man, and take away his
goods. By the blood of the
Lamb, Christ Iesus, they al|so
escape that death which
is due to them, by being
borne in the kingdome of
Satan. The Israelites by the
red Sea were cleared from
the prosecution and dan|ger
of Egypt, and through
it found a path toward the
land of promise. The true

Israelites by spirituall and
inward baptisme are dead
vnto sinne and the king|dome
of Satan, and by that
death escape from them;
hauing also a way painted
out by the sanctification
thereof to the Kingdom of
blessednesse. Forty yeeres
long after their man-hood
did the Israelites wander in
the wildernesse, vntill they
came into Canaan: and for|tie
yeeres are the vsuall
time appointed to the chil|dren
of God to trauell in
this world, before they
come to rest. And in this
fortie yeeres, the onely or|dinarie
food of Israel that
gaue them life and comfort
was Manna from heauen:
and the chiefe food of the

regenerate is the Spirit of
Christ, which dwelleth in
them, and is their life and
comfort. Slender and light
did that Manna seeme to
the Israelites, yet sufficed to
bring them to the land of
Promise: and small doth the
life and comfort appeare of
this Spirit to fleshly reason,
euen of the regenerate; but
it will serue to bring them
to heauen, and to comfort
and strengthen them by
the way. Manna shewed,
that man liueth not by
bread onely, but by euerie
word which proceedeth
from the mouth of God; to
teach vs, that by this Spirit
which proceedeth from the
breath of God, we haue as
certaine a life, as wee haue

by bread. But as at first
there was an host to fetch
Israel backe into bondage,
and at last there were hosts,
giants,  gates of brasse to
keepe the~ fro~ the possession
of the Land of Promise. Ac|cordingly
when Christians
are escaped from the king|dome
of Satan by regene|ration,
and walking to Ie|rusalem
which is aboue, Le|gions
and armies of wicked
spirits, the gates of hell, yea
Og the King of Basan, the
huge Prince of hel, and the
Principalities of darknesse
fight against them, and seek
to turne backe, and stop
their progresse vnto rest.
But vnto Israel their ene|mies
were as bread, euen a
prey and a triumph; and to

vs the God of peace will
tread Satan vnder our feet,
the gates of hell shall not
preuaile against vs, but their
temptations shall bee our
aduancements, and their
resistance shall giue vs the
title of conquerours. And
that we may make full be|nefit
of this example, let
vs especially be carefull to
walke like those Israelites,
which continued and per|fected
their course from E|gypt
to Canaan; the chiefe
resemblances among the
Israelites of the true Chri|stians
among vs. Let vs a|uoide
the sinnes of them,
who fell by the way: let vs
make great reckoning of
the Manna of the Spirit,
feeding, comforting, and

contenting our selues in all
estates therewith; in all e|states,
trials, and changes.
For this small dram of our
new birth, though it seeme
to melt sometimes before
the heate of tentation, and
the bread thereof tasts not
so strong as the onions and
flesh pots of naturall lust
and pleasures: yet it is of the
wombe of the morning, it
comes from the day-spring
on high, it hath life eter|nall
in it; and this little seed
shall raise vs vp in the glori|ous
image of the incorrup|tible
and euerliuing sonnes
of God. For the weake
things of God are euer
strong inough to accom|plish
their appointed end,
they are backt with omni|potence,

and if they wan|ted
any thing in the~selues,
yet from that shall they
draw perfect sufficiencie.


45
The sanctified soule in
this world is a widdow;
Christ is her husband, and
he is absent from her; The
senses haue their pleasant
obiects to delight them,
the flesh hath grosse matter
enough to satisfie the
lusts thereof. But the soule
beholdeth not an obiect
for her pure ioy, for hee
whom the soule loueth and
should only loue, is gone to
a farre countrey; yet is her
heart towards him, shee
thinkes still vpon him
though a pilgrime in a
strange land; shee breaketh

out into longing passions
and inquireth of the sheep|heards
for him: she lookes
by a chinke, with the eye
of spirituall light into hea|uen,
and so hath a glimse of
him for whom shee is sicke
of loue; for he stands be|hinde
a wall, this earth of
ours is a partition betwixt
vs and him, and he lookes
through it but by a little
grate; yet still is shee his on|ly,
as he is hers, shee reioy|ceth
in him, and remem|bers
his loue more then
wine; shee entreates him to
draw her that shee may run
after him; to set her as a
seale on his heart, and as a
signet on his arme, for her
Loue is as strong as death.
She fitteth her selfe for him

by being all glorious with|in,
and chastly reserues her
selfe vnto him as a garden
inclosed, and a spring shut
vp. Shee is decked with
fruitfulnesse, euen with ful|nesse
of all sweete fruits,
trees of incense  al sweete
spices. Thus louing, thus
glorious, thus chaste, thus
holy, thus fruitfull in good|nesse,
shee waiteth for his
returne vntill the eternall
day breake, and the earthly
shadowes flie away. This is
a sanctified soule, goe thou
and doe the like.


46
Herein is that in expressi|ble
height of Gods mercy
to his elect much expres|sed,
that the most wise and
laborious men in morall

goodnesse, yet not hauing
grace, passe vnder the Law,
and their very goodnesse is
condemned to be sin. For
such indeede it is, not com|ming
from him who is the
only Author of goodnesse,
nor returning to him who
is the true end of all things.
Yet weake and sinful soules,
though laden with great
infirmities, by the mercie of
God are taken from the
Law into grace,  so their
many sinnes are forgiuen
them; that weake and fraile
men, if striuing against sin,
though often falling into
it, might yet comfort them|selues
in that high mercie,
which laid hold on them,
and singled them out for
its owne sake, and not for

theirs; and that no flesh
might reioyce in it selfe; for
the glory of flesh without
the mercy of God, is but
shame to it selfe, and mat|ter
for iustice. As therefore
we haue an infinite benefit
freely bestowed, let vs
thankfully glorifie the gi|uer,
who gaue it vs chiefely
for his owne glory: and
withall let vs take heede
that though there bee so
great mercy with God, yet
wee make not worke for
mercie, lest mercy temp|ted,
turne into iudgement.


47
The obedience of insen|sible,
and brute creatures
vnto the will of God, is a
great checke and reproofe
vnto the disobedience of

man; Man is the chiefest of
creatures, and they the low|est,
yet doe they as farre ex|ceede
him in obedience, as
he doth them in naturall e|minence.
The will of God
is a straight and fixed line,
to which all things crea|ted
by the same will, should
so fit and fashion them|selues,
that they should not
bowe from it in any degree;
This doe the baser things,
stedfastly following the im|printed
light  law of their
first Creation. So the storke
and swallow know their ap|pointed
times, the oxe
knowes his owner, and the
Asse his masters crib; the
sea moueth in setled and
vnmoouing course; the
starres fit their many chan|ges

to a steadie rule, answe|rable
to the will of him that
neuer changeth. But man
that had a burning Lampe,
euen a fountaine of light in
his soule (whereas brute
beasts haue but a light de|termined
and certaine; and
liuelesse things haue no
light of reason, but an or|derly
influence and moo|uing
power fixed into the~)
this reasonable man is
wholly gone astray from
his rule, and not onely run|neth
from it but against it.
Thus is he farre worse then
things worse then himself,
and openly shewes, that he
hath fallen and not they.
What now remaines, but
that as this abased Lord of
creatures, hath beene chec|ked

and reprooued by the
creatures his vassals, so he
should also bee instructed
by them? Therefore  thou
man goe willingly hereaf|ter
to the Oxe and Asse to
learne thy duty. There is in
them, as in the Asse of Ba|laam,
that which may in|struct
thee. Be ashamed of
thy corruption and fall, but
bee not ashamed by any
thing not falne, to bring thy
selfe back to the place from
whence thou fellest: when
thou seest creatures obedi|ent
to thee, thence know
that obedience is also due
to God from thee, who is
infinitely more aboue thee,
then thou aboue them.
When thou seest mutuall
loue betweene creatures of

one kinde, learne thence
Charitie to thy owne kind:
In sum, when thou seest a|ny
creature continuing the
steady  appointed course
of his kinde, call thereby to
minde, that there is a cer|taine
and appointed course
to thee also, wherein thou
shouldest as certainly satis|fie
the will of thy Creator,
who requireth a conformi|tie
of all things in their
place and order, and the
chiefest of the chiefest.


48
It hath beene an often
pollicy of Satan, when hee
could not pull downe good
things with euill, to pull
them downe by setting
them together by the eares
betweene themselues. Not

to mention the too-much
opposition betweene the
reformed Christians, I can
example it in the quarrels
which haue been betweene
faith and workes, prayer
 preaching, and the com|mendation
of the learned
workes of some, in a com|paratiue
despite of as pro|fitable
works of others. But
this is an vnkindly debate,
and issueth by no meanes
out of the nature of the
things the~selues, but from
mans contentiousnes, want
of iudgement, or ouer-pri|sing
our owne apprehensi|ons.
Each vertue hath her
seuerall place, and in that
place shee excelleth  hath
commendation, and thru|steth
out no other vertue

either from place or worth.
The place of faith is first in
the vnderstanding, but wor|king
downward on the wil
and affections, it ioynes vs
to Christ; so is it the hand
of the ingraffer, it sets the
eye of the soule euer on
God in Christ: it is excel|lent
for vnion,  for all the
benefits and fruites com|ming
from that vnio~, wher|of
workes are a part. The
place of workes is chiefely
in the will and affections,
yet grounded in the vnder|standing,
 springing forth
at the members: They ex|presse
the vertue of the vni|on,
they praise and glorifie
him that bestowed this v|nion;
they are excellent as
fruits, but they haue both

being  excellence fro~ him
whom faith apprehendeth.
Preaching deliuers words
of knowledge, of reproch,
of comfort, of exhortation,
to our ignorance, to our
sinnefulnesse, to our de|spaire,
to our deadnesse of
heart: yea it teacheth vs
how to pray, it perswadeth
vs to pray; prayer fetcheth
downe grace from the Au|thor
of grace, by which,
preaching it selfe is made
profitable, and life is put in|to
the dead letter; it pro|uides
vs for hearing, and
makes vs able to doe what
we heare. In summe, it pro|cures
helpe in all things
from him, without whom
we can doe nothing. Thus
it seemes both faith and

workes, prayer and preach|ing,
bee of kinne, mutuall
embracers, and farre from
that contention which is
fastned to them: each desire
that their fellowes may
haue appointed time and
place, because in their pro|speritie
themselues doe Ho|rish.
Now for the last kind
of debate, which hath been
set betweene excellent wri|ters,
discretion and charitie
might serue for a full reme|die.
If any one bee in any
thing good and profitable,
charitie and wisedome will
rather comme~d that worth
of his, then obscure it by
comparisons: if another be
more learned, it may bee
the lesse learned doth more
edifie; and sure it, is that such

contention doth not edifie
at all. The Schoolemen are
excellent in subtilties, they
search how things are, they
dig for the roote; and in
sum, if sifted from errors,
and clearely co~ceiued, they
may giue great light to the
vnderstanding. Another
Diuine goeth more plaine|ly
to worke, he sets foorth
the matter without curious
search of the manner, hera|ther
shewes that it is, then
how it is; yet he shewes e|nough
for saluation, hee
shewes enough for the most
general capacitie, and with|all
he mooues the will, and
stirres vp the affections to
receiue life,  refuse death.
The first make a few men
excellent, but find not of|ten

a fit great audie~ce; they
are good teachers of tea|chers.
The later doth gene|rally
profit, he goeth into
the wil  affections,  vn|lockes
the heart for God,
the seate where he delights
to dwell. Of this kind hath
this age most neede of, of
which prophecies foretold,
that the loue of many shold
now waxe cold, that men
should loue their pleasures
more then God: and of
which experience telles vs,
that knowledge hath farre
out-run obedience, which
should follow close at the
heeles of it; and therefore
of the two, lacks most nou|rishment,
and incourage|ment.
Generally, let them
that build the house of

God, if they hold a sword
in one hand, yet hold it a|gainst
the enemy, not one
against another: much lesse
let the by-standers take
their swords out of their
hands, and fight for them,
when they will not them|selues.
The building is not
promoted by this meanes,
but hindered, yea, pulled
downe.


49
The euils of this life are
great and many, whereof
some are immediately from
the hand of God, others
from the wickednesse of
men, others from the ma|lice
of Satan; and of these
also God hath the com|mand.
These euils are by
men diuersly receiued, some

entertaine them only with
passion, and these cure one
vexation with another, and
adde sorrow to sorrow.
Some by reasons morall or
naturall, seeke to preserue
their owne quietnesse, and
these obtaine not often
what they seeke; and if they
doe, they haue but a fading
and transitorie rest, which
being past, is all one with
sorrow past; for then they
are both like vanitie and
nothing. But a third sort
of receiuers are they, that
receiue them with faith, e|uen
a beleeuing soule, whose
obiect is God in Christ, and
which looking vp to God,
both sees him, and in him
sees what hee sees in these
euils: this is the going into

the Sanctuarie, where the e|uils
of this life are only tru|ly
discerned, and so thereby
conquered. For looking vp
to God, we see him our mer|cifull
Father, vnchangeable
Sauiour, and our stedfast
happinesse: we see that the
euils which he sends, or di|rects
to vs, are rods of loue,
and their stripes are hea|lers;
they punish the flesh,
and that but temporally,
that the spirit may liue eter|nally.
And for the wicked,
who are somtimes gods ex|ecutioners,
he tels vs, that
he beholds their wicked a|ctio~s,
that they stand in the
slipperie place of a transito|rie
and dying life, and that
they and their works shall
come to iudgement; and

then their wrongs shall
turn into eternal torme~ts to
the~,  to vs into eternal glo|ry.
And euils thus receiued
are comfortable euils, for by
faith, we see affliction to be
a treasure euerlasting, farre
better then treasures of E|gypt;
they are edifying e|uils,
for they build vs vp;
being beaten downe in the
body of sinne, wee are built
vp in grace and truth. So
these beleeuers onely make
benefit of euils, and in stead
of being vexed by them, or
receiuing no aduantage of
them, they turne them into
spiritual nourishment; ther|fore
let vs goe still armed
with this faith, which only
ouercommeth the world,

and makes it seruiceable. It
is the onely strength and
support of a Christia~ in this
vale of miseries, and that
which keepes him from be|ing
oppressed of them, and
that helps him to suppresse
and vse them. As much
faith as wee haue, so much
strength we haue; and if we
lack strength, we lack faith.
If then euils pursue thee,
and thou faintest vnder
them, know that thou wan|test
faith, as surely as Peter
did, when he began to sink.
For how can the beleeuing
soule be ouercome, which
beholdeth the Almightie
on her side, euen when ten
thousand hemme her in?
yea, which then beholdeth

these euils short and transi|tory,
yet by transitory light|nesse
working eternall glo|rie.
Beleeuest thou these
things, and yet art thou a|fraid?
it cannot bee that
thou shouldest be afraid of
happinesse, though entred
into through affliction; but
that thou dost not verily
behold and apprehend it.
Therefore hencefoorth in
thy troubles goe out of thy
flesh, and consider not ther|with;
for flesh and blood
will adde waight vnto
them: but goe into the Spi|rit,
where the Comforter
dwels by his anointing,
working faith in thy soule;
there shalt thou find wher|with
to conquer, there shalt
thou finde wherewith to

comfort, yea to better thy
selfe by euils.


50
If it be asked who is the
greatest foole, it may be an|swered,
The worldly wisest
man. For true wisedome is
that onely which finds out
true happines, and agreeth
with the highest wisedome
the begotten of God; pro|portionably,
that is the
greatest folly which is most
laborious, curious, and effe|ctuall
in seeking vanitie in+stead
of happinesse: and the
whilest goeth astray with
all the might thereof from
him, who onely is the soue|raigne
good. Therefore
when thou seest a man by
wicked craft gathering a|bout
him thicke clay, and

setling his hope and heart
thereon, know him to bee
the great spirituall foole,
and his good successe ther|in,
to bee but prosperitie in
folly. For his deceiued hart
feedeth on dust and vanity;
he hath forsaken the foun|taine
of liuing waters, and
hath hath made cesternes
for waters that faile: this the
end will make euident; for
then it will appeare euen to
the foole himselfe, that the
foundation can no longer
stand, then the thing on
which it was founded. But
in the ende the earth shall
melt away,  the elements
shall consume with heate;
and therefore the hopes
built on earth, and earthly
things must needes fall

downe, and wholly be rui|ned.
But that infinite and
eternall happinesse, whose
name is, I am, hee is for e|uer.
The hopes built on
him cannot be shaken, the
heart fixed on him, cannot
be ouerthrowne; that foun|dation
remaineth sure, and
the building thereon is
Mount Sion, which cannot
be moued; he will bee left
after all things, to receiue
and crowne thee. Be wise
therefore, O ye Princes, yea
be wise, O yee wise men of
the earth. Kisse the Sonne,
euen that eternal wisedom,
be yee instructed by him,
and then ye shall be truely
wise; his Spirit will teach
you that truest wisdome to
lay your out money,  that

for food of eternall life; to
forsake these drie cesternes
which containe those fa|ding
and dying pleasures,
and to seeke the fountaine
of liuing waters, euen the
God of Gods, in whose pre|sence
only is the fulnesse of
ioy, and with whom onely
are the pleasures for euer|more.


51
A great burthen of this
Iland is blasphemy,  the
prophanation of the name
of God: a heauy, yet vn|profitable
sinne it is, by
which God is dishonoured,
and man damned at a very
low rate. So doth this peo|ple
sel himself for nothing,
and as seekers of death, ra|ther
then they will not die,

they will anger God of set
purpose, and without profit
procure their owne destru|ction.
Surely, as it hath bin
well obserued, this sin hath
a more pure corruption
and venome in it, then
most of his fellowes; for o|ther
sinnes haue common|ly
some sensible profit or
pleasure to Midwife them
into the world: but this in
it selfe is neither pleasing
nor profitable, but issueth
out of the meere prophane|nesse
of hart, euen of a care|lesnesse
and contempt of
God. For how can it be, but
God is exceedingly despi|sed
and neglected, when
his name is vsed to make
vp idle places of a hollow
or vnfilled sentence, or to

vent or vtter with some
grace  force the choler 
malice of a displeased man:
But be it knowne to thee,
O man, of what sort or de|gree
soeuer thou bee, that
God made thee to serue
him, and in part of seruice
to feare and sanctifie his
name;  indeed thou art not
of thy self worthy to serue,
or to name him: How then
darest thou to make him
and his name to serue thee,
thy prophane discourse, 
thy rash and vntempered
anger? It was written anci|ently,
Holines to the Lord;
and surely where God is,
holinesse is about him;
where God will bring any
to him, hee puts holines vp|on
them; and where his ve|ry

name is, he will haue ho|linesse
applied and appro|priated
to it. Therefore his
name must bee brought
foorth onely in holy vses,
and an extreamely vnfit
match it is, to ioyne the ho|liest
name with the vnpu|rest
and prophanest passi|ons
and speeches. If thou
wearest but the vizard of a
Christian, and a man should
aske whether thou canst
say the Lords Prayer, and
the ten Commandements,
thou wilt extremely scorne
the question. But assure thy
selfe, that God infinitely
more scorneth, that in that
prayer, one should offer vp
a petition to him, that Gods
name should be hallowed,
who cares not whether hee

haue his petition granted
or not, yea many times
takes paines to make it
void. And much he scornes
that any shold say his com|mandements,
that care not
to doe them; and that the
same tongue which saies,
Thou shalt not take the
name of God in vaine, shold
presently take the same
name in vaine, and so bee
contrary to it selfe, giue the
lye to it selfe, and dishonour
the name which it falsely
pretended to reuerence.
But if thou wilt needs loue
this sinne more then God,
the same God who now
endures thy blasphemies
with a limited patience, wil
one day when that pati|ence
is come to the full

bounds thereof, ransome
his name from thy vnhal|lowed
throate; and he who
is a consuming fire shall
make euery touch of his
name to burne in thy bow|els.
Then it shall bee felt,
though not now beleeued,
that God is still actiue, and
either sanctifies or con|sumes
wheresoeuer hee is;
and if he haue been in thee
much but not sanctifying,
he shall be in thee much al|so,
but consuming. Hee is
too strong for vs, and so
cannot suffer of vs; and
though he seeme to doe it
by being taken at will into
our licentious mouthes, yet
it is but as the taking of a
coale or hooke, which
burne, and bite,  take the

takers: so thy owne wicked
words shall fret into thee
and become thy snare and
consumption. But that eue|ry
one may know his part
and interest in this sin, and
the iudgement of it, the dif|ferent
degrees thereof doe
readily appeare. There is
one sort of prophaners
that keepe open house of
blasphemies, and the name
of that God which dwells
not in their hearts, yet issu|eth
still at their mouthes:
these are in the depth of Sa|tan,
and be the eldest sons
of hell. And it is to be won|dred
if they beleeue not
that there is a God, how
they speake so oft of him;
and if they beleeue God to
be, how they feare not to

dishonour him: who if hee
be, must needs bee iust to
himselfe, and take his owne
part against those that thus
abuse his name. Another
sort there is of them that
leauing the name of God,
yet vse other names and
words in stead thereof, and
so by an euill idolatrie,
translate the honour of
God to creatures or imagi|nations
of their owne. A
third sort is of such as in e|uery
idle exclamation or
admiration, at any vnusuall
or odde matter, take vp the
name of God, altogether
vnprofitably and vnseaso|nably:
who is not to be na|med
but with reuerence,
and for the bettring of our
selues or others. For as oft

as we are not the better for
naming him, wee are the
worse. These wil sometimes
say, if thou admonish them,
that they meane no ill; but
they must neither meane
ill, nor doe ill; and because
by carelesnesse  vnwatch|fulnesse
of speech this often
happeneth, let those that
feare God, watch their
mouth, that they offend
not with their tongue. And
generally let al those whom
God hath mooued to glori|fie
him, and to speake good
of his name, teach the
same to their children, that
we may leaue a godly seede
behinde vs in our roome; it
being a complaint of this
time, that childre~ too much
learne to speake English

and oathes together, and so
to blaspheme God almost
as soone as hee hath made
them.


52
Custome of euill hath
sundry great euils belon|ging
to it; one that it selfe is
a long succession of wic|kednesse,
and offence a|gainst
God: Another, that
growing into familiaritie
with men, at length it
comes to the reputation of
no vice, if not of a vertue.
A third, that it takes roote
and establishment by con|tinuance,
and growes so
stiffe and immoueable, that
it is like the lawes of the
Medes and Persians which
may not bee altered. This
course and sway it hath

both in the liues of parti|cular
men, and great Chur|ches,
and that to so great a
conquest of mens iudge|ments,
as well as their acti|ons,
that they haue enacted
a law, that an euill well set|led
ought not to be remoo|ued.
This the Church of
Rome practiseth; but as we
see in the thing it selfe, that
it is a wisedome which as|cendeth
from below, and is
diuellish and sensuall: so by
the consequence of it wee
see it is temporally dange|rous
to them that hold it;
For this position brought
that Church to this present
weaknesse. Ambitious and
commodious errors had
crept into that Church, to
which, time had giuen such

strength and estimation,
that it was a very espe|ciall
wisedome to holde
them vntouched and vn|mooued.
But they that de|nie
iust things, often pro|uoke
to the taking away of
them and more; as tyranny
often hath driuen away
kingdomes. And somwhat
accordingly, while they
would keepe their errours,
they haue prouoked men
to take from them that
which once was held law|full,
though as things now
stand, they may seeme to
haue lost edification. So
with their supremacy, they
haue lost Patriarchy,  the
ten tribes are rent from
that Rehoboam which wold
not ease the burden of his

fathers. This may serue for
an example euen to our
Churches, whereby they
may learne, not to establish
themselues by establishing
any sinfull corruption, if a|ny
such shall appeare: for
that very corruption by
which men shall thinke to
strengthen themselues, is
likely to prooue their can|ker
and destruction. This
was the iustice of God of
old against the Calues of
Ieroboam, and of late against
the whoredome of Rome.
Therefore according to
wise Salomon, be not wise in
your owne eyes, but feare
the Lord, and depart from
euill; Let all your wise poli|cies
bee grounded, or at
least subordinate to true

pietie. Doe not by defen|ding
a knowne sinne, giue
a handle to a rough amen|der,
who taking a Church
by the blemishes thereof,
may perchance pull out
them and the sound flesh
which hangeth to them.
The Ancients knew the
corruptnesse of mankinde,
that it still brought forth
tares among wheate; and
therefore appointed gene|rall
and particular Synods
for the rooting vp of them;
our age is latter, and there|fore
worser: if wee grow in
diseases, let vs not abate in
the remedies. If we cannot
haue generall Councels, let
vs make true vse of our na|tionall
sinods by serious ex|amining
in them, not so

much what euill customes
it might seeme policie to
maintaine, as what custo|marie
drosse it were true
and spirituall wisedome to
refine. In like sort, a remedy
of euill customes is need|ful
to euery member of the
Church; If thou hast done
euill, amend that which is
past by future goodnesse,
and adde not to thy vo|mits,
returning. But let all
especially shun and kill the
beginnings of such wicked
customes; for the more
they continue in them, the
stronger they make a chaine
for themselues: so that at
last they are mightily en|thralled
thereby, and are
still further from escaping.



53
The roote of all obedi|ence
and fulfilling the law,
is the loue of God: if wee
loue God truly, we keepe
the first Table, and we will
doe what wee can to keepe
the second. For how loueth
any man God whome hee
hath not seene, who loueth
not his brother whome he
hath seene? And who lo|ueth
God y^t will not please
him  keepe his comman|dements?
That this work of
loue which of it selfe is plea|sant,
 whose yoke is light,
may by vs pleasantly and
easily to be performed, let
vs consider partly, (for wee
cannot fully) wherfore God
is bee loued. God is to be
loued first for himselfe. For

he onely is the fulnesse of
happinesse, and all suffici|encie,
since in him onely is
Being, Light, Life, Wise|dome,
Glory, Power, Good|nesse.
Other things which
carry these things names,
haue them not indeed; for
nothing created hath any
of these of their owne, but
in him and his they haue
all that they haue, and they
be that which they be. So
God is, and there is nothing
beside him. Secondly, God
is to bee loued for the loue
which he hath expressed to
vs; for loue deserueth loue,
and chiefely a great loue
deserueth a little loue; but
most chiefely that greatest
loue of the Creator, de|serues
the greatest loue

(which at greatest is but lit|tle
in comparison of the o|ther)
of the creature. Now
if I shold go about to shew
the loue of God to man, I
should labour to bring infi|nitenesse
within measure,
and to bound within the
knowledge of man a law in|comprehensible.
This in
summe may be conceiued:
That God loued vs when
he had but foreknown and
foreappointed our beeing,
when we were not at al, but
only in his purpose: Then
he loued vs with a loue that
marked and sealed vs to e|ternall
happines. This loue
produced our Creation in
an excellent image,  this
loue to man falne from that
created image, gaue him

the greatest gift that is or
may be, euen his owne Son
to cleare him from the
guilt of his fall by a bitter
satisfaction; and to imprint
a begotten image stedfast
and permanent, instead of
the created image mooue|able
and decayed, by a pre|tious
regeneration. Thus
from God the Father with
the gift of the Sonne, haue
we also the holy Ghost: so
is the whole Trinity impar|ted
to vs, and what more
can he doe for his beloued?
Yet his loue ceaseth not,
but proceeds to guide, to
purge, to increase, to de|fend,
to cherish, as a father
nurtureth his sonne, and as
an Eagle stirreth ouer her
yong. Much is our weake|nesse,

 much he strength|neth
vs; many are our fals,
and he forgiueth vs much:
many are our dangers, and
troubles, and the Lord de|liuers
vs out of all. Let vs
therefore loue the Lord our
strength, let vs loue him
much who forgiueth vs
much: Let vs loue the Lord
because hee receiueth our
Prayers, and deliuers vs in
the time of trouble. Let vs
loue him first for that
which he is, for he only is
worthie of loue; his courts
only are truely delectable,
and his presence amiable:
There only dwelleth the
fulnesse of ioy,  the plea|sures
of eternitie. Next, let
vs loue God for his loue to
vs, and be glad that so great

a loue will bee contented
with a loue so narrow and
scant. Let our loue be raised
to the highest, and let vs fit
it to him as much as wee
may, that the narrownesse
may bee caused rather by
the lownesse of our conditi|on
and beeing, then the
straitnesse of our will: so let
it be with all the soule, and
all the strength. Againe,
since our loue is chiefely
expressed in pleasing him,
and hee is chiefely pleased
in keeping his commande|ments:
Let vs as much as
we loue him so much desire
to please him, in a propor|tionable
obseruation of his
commandements. If this
we doe, we shall haue com|fortable
assurance of enioy|ing

him whom we loue, and
then are wee happie aboue
our fellowes: the oyle of
gladnesse is powred vpon
vs, and according to Saint
Paul, we may reioyce con|tinually.
For if we be assu|red
to see and enioy God
our perfect hapines, what
sorrow can ouer-way this
ioy, what losse can coun|teruaile
this gaine? Surely
we may be contented with
whatsoeuer wee haue, for
godlinesse hath brought
vs, the chiefest and most in|comparable
gaine. If wee
shall haue the greatest hap|pinesse,
how can any tem|porall
thing make vs mise|rable?
If then wee grieue
much, we esteeme not this
happinesse as we should, or

we turne our eyes from the
assurance thereof. But ther|on
our eyes beeing fixed,
and not on any thing be|tweene
vs and it, let vs goe
on couragiously, louing
God, pleasing God, and re|ioycing
in God; in whom
wee may continually and
co~stantly through all chan|ges
behold as ours, perfect
ioy and absolute felicity.


54
In a Christian when he
becomes a sonne of God,
the forme and character of
a Christian and of a sonne
is created in him. This cha|racter
is the roote of him,
fro~ whence floweth what|soeuer
fruit of good-works
issueth from him. Beeing
thus animated, the Spirit

which hath animated vs,
doth not then leaue vs, but
seconds this his first worke,
with a continuall supply of
strength and increase of
grace, vntill we appeare be|fore
God in Sion. For this
roote is rooted in Christ,
from whose Spirit it suck|eth
stil new strength. So we
are not as Adam, left to our
selues; for then wee should
prooue accidents without
a substance, and perish into
nothing. But being groun|ded
in Christ, the Rock and
the Life, wee cannot perish,
or be annihilated; and here|in
is our excellency aboue
Adam. Indeed sometimes
Christ drawes in his Spirit,
and doth not water vs with
fresh grace; and then the

soule drie and withering,
cries as forsaken, Cast mee
not away from thy pre|sence,
and take not thy ho|ly
Spirit from me. In all
this is matter for humilitie
against presumption, and
for comfort against despe|ration.
Thy goodnesse is
altogether of God, hee first
powred it into thee, when
he new begat thee Againe,
the continuance and con|tinuall
increase thereof is
from God. So what hast
thou of thine owne, or what
hast thou, that thou hast
not receiued of God? Ther|fore
be humble, as a thing
which in it selfe hath no
goodnesse; and if thou wilt
not, know farder, that God
will take this goodnes from

thee for a time, in which
thou gloriest as thine own:
and by the lamentable ex|perience
of that time, will
plainely shew thee thy own
weakenesse and corrupti|on.
For when he takes his
from thee, thine is onely
left, and that will lothsome|ly
appeare to thee to be no|thing
but dregs of sin and
corruption. Then shalt
thou be humbled by mise|rie,
which wouldest not by
bounty; and thy own dead|nesse,
which before thou
wouldst not see, now thou
shalt feele. Yet is here also
matter for consolation; for
being rooted in Christ,
though hee draw in his
breath, and leaue vs so farre,
that we feele not the power

thereof, yet our vnion still
remaineth with him, and
wee are not parted from
Christ, though his vertue
somewhat depart from vs;
wee are grounded on the
Rocke, and hell gates can|not
preuaile against vs; we
are one with life, and life
cannot wholly forsake vs.
Yea after desertions, when
God hath drawne vs to giue
him the glory, which is his
owne, and so instructed and
bettered vs by his chastise|ments
(for punish vs meere|ly
hee will not because wee
are his sonnes) hee addeth
to this benefit another, e|uen
an increase of grace be|yond
the old bounds. So
that though out of our
selues, he giues vs humilia|tion;

yet from our vnion
with him, he giueth vs ex|altation,
that he which glo|rieth,
may glorie in the
Lord; and that hee which
wanteth, may seeke him
onely, who onely filleth the
hungrie with goodnesse.


55
Death, at y^e diuels first
bringing in of it, was a fear|full
punishment, cutting off
man from all ioy and com|fort:
But when God in his
mercy annexed infinite and
euerlasting ioies vnto death,
death became then aduan|tage,
and that an especiall
one, as being the gate of e|ternall
happinesse. But the
naturall man seeing onely
with naturall eies, behol|deth
therfore only the sen|sible
and visible comforts

of this life, not knowing
the second ioyes; wherfore
his desire being bounded
with his knowledge, resteth
onely in them, and accor|dingly
he accounts death
a chiefly miserable  feare|ful
thing, by which he must
be depriued of such ioyes.
But the spirituall man by
the spirituall eye of faith
(which the other hath not)
discerning spirituall things,
beholdeth euidently the in|finite
 endles ioyes which
are in the glorious presence
of the highest happines, e|uen
God the Creator: and
valuing them according to
the ods of their worth, hee
longeth after them, he thir|steth
to inioy them, hee ac|counteth
death that which

it is, euen a great aduan|tage;
as that which doth
not take away life alto|gether
from a Christian
man, but most happily
changeth it, turning a life
fraile, miserable and sinfull,
into a life mortall, secure,
holy and happie. And as
that which doth not take a|way
ioy, but changeth it,
turning the impure narrow
and the interrupted ioyes,
which here we take in the
creatures, into a pure, vn|bounded,
 incessant ioies
in God the Creator. Now
herein is the great diffe|rence
betweene a naturall
man and a Christian. The
naturall man is in bondage
while he liueth for feare of
death; hee goes on, casting

an eye still on this vizard, as
a thing of terror  affright|me~t;
he is troubled with the
darknesse of not being, the
fearefull shadow of death.
But the true Christian is
bold as a Lion, hee treadeth
vpon death, as hauing lost
the sting, by which it may
kill vnto a second death: he
gladly makes vse of it, wil|lingly
giuing himself to it as
to a messe~ger of God, which
comes to fetch him from
earth to heauen, from mise|rie
to felicitie, from the
workes of the sixe daies
which could not blesse
their daies, to that blessed
rest of the Maker of those
workes, which rest blessed
the seuenth day; it being in|deed
blessednesse it selfe,

and there being no other
blessednesse but it selfe. Be
it therefore the high priui|ledge
of the Christian, to
enioy death, to reioyce in
it,  to account it the dore
of felicitie. And that euery
Christian may make vse of
this priuiledge, this must al|so
be the practise of a Chri|stian;
euen often with the
eie of faith cleared by pray|er
and meditation, to be|hold
the ioyes which are
at the right hand of God, e|uen
the glory of the new
Ierusalem, whereof God is
the Sunne. For as much as
we se it, so much shall we see
it to surmount all worldly
ioy; and as much as we see it
to surmount, so much shall
our desire to it, surmount

our desire to the world, and
finally so much greater shal
be our loue of death, as our
desire to that ioy is greater.
Wherefore if thou louest
death but a litle, thy sight of
that ioy is but little; but see
it more,  thy affection to
death shal be more. If nature
run to the eie and eare, to
draw thee to life, run thou
to the word  spirit to draw
thee to heauen. These will
shew thee more reason why
to desire God, the~ flesh can
why to loue this life. But
thou likest, as thou saist, the
bargaine well, and dost ac|count
it gainfull exchange:
but thou likest not the
means; death is painful, and
thou art not co~tented to be
happy by paine. Surely sick|nes

is paine, but death abso|lutely
in it self seemes not to
be paine. For the setting of a
ioint is many times more
paine, then death by a con|sumption.
The conuulsions
which appeare, are co~mon|ly
from the strife of nature
with diseases; but death
followeth vsually after na|ture
is ouercome, and then
life goes out gently like a
consumed taper. But if it
must be co~fessed, that there
is paine in the sicknesse of
death, or in death it self, get
thou again into the spirit, 
yet shalt thou see, that death
is adua~tage. Al the suffrings
of this life, are not worthy of
the glory that shal be reuea|led.
For the weight of y^t ioy
is an exceeding weight, and

ouerweyes farre all tempo|rall
and momentany afflicti|on.
Therefore if by lesser
weight of temporall griefe,
thou purchase y^e exceeding
weight of eternall ioy, thou
art yet a great gainer, thou
hast made a most profita|ble
exchange, thou maist
yet reioyce, and goe gladly
through paine vnto a sur|passing
happines. Go thou
therefore, and follow the
patterne of our faith Christ
Iesus, who for the ioy set
before him, endured the
crosse,  despised the shame.
Follow the seruants of
Christ, who reioyced in tri|bulations,
and went ioyful|ly
through all persecutions,
scourgings, stonings, bur|nings,
and death it selfe, vn|to

that glory which is a|boue.
Yea, let vs say with
the seruants of God, If God
commanded vs yet a grea|thing,
should we not doe it?
for the end shall abound|antly
recompence the way;
the end which is happines,
the way which is griefe, and
the way passeth away, but
y^e end is endles,  endures
for euer. Let vs go on there|fore
hopefully and cheare|fully,
through al sorrowes 
bitternesses, limited  tran|sitory,
vnto happines large
without end or bound; solid
without lightnes,  conti|nuing
without cessation: let
y^e sight of this felicity coun|terpoise,
yea ouerwey with
comfort, the trouble impar|ted
by the feeling of griefe.



56
A main cause of much
of the griefe and folly of
men is this; That men re|solue
to make something of
this world. They raise great
plots vpon it, and intend to
bring it into a Method; and
out of things so ordered to
draw some great happines
and contentment. But God
hath resolued the contrary;
to make nothing of the
world, but to turne it into
vanity of vanities: he hath
set it forth as a thing to be
shaken, to be remooued, to
resolue with the lost fire,
and only to be a schole and
nurcery for the next world.
Therefore doth hee suffer
things in this world of va|nity
to run without diffe|rence,
yea often without

present iustice, and often to
perish, to be ouerthrowne
and to vndergoe great de|solations.
Now mans mind
being prepared to receiue
comfort from the world
fitted vnto it selfe,  Gods
minde beeing to let the
world run into many chan|ges,
destructions, and final|ly
vnto vanity it self; it must
needs bee that men often|times
haue their purposes
crossed by the purpose of
God,  their courses ouer|throwen
by the ouerruling
destiny of God. One hath
gotten him a good wife, a
good house, and a good de|meanes,
and is, as they call
it, well setled to liue; he ta|keth
comfort in the course
which hee is entring into,

and he hath bespoken his
heart to bee merry and re|ioyce.
But behold, sudden|ly
the disease of the world
layes hold on his estate, on
him or his wife; and then
the plot is mard, the ioy is
lost, for the foundation
therof is ouerthrowne. The~
what weeping, what way|ling,
what sorrow  brea|king
of hearts? hope is tur|ned
into griefe, and the
more the hope was, the
more is the griefe. But the
only way to preuent this,
is, that the purpose of man
agree to the purpose of
God, and accordingly that
man expect no more from
the world then God allow|eth
the world to giue.
Therfore let him perswade

himselfe, that whatsoeuer
part of this world he hath
gotten into his vse, that
part is subiect to the law of
the whole, which is bound
vnder change, perishing,
and vanity. And conse|quently
let him expect no
other certainty from it,
then such as may be from a
state of vncertainty. If he
haue a house well fitted, a
wife well conditioned, a
large demeanes, beautifull
and towardly children; let
him know his house may
burne, his wife may die, his
land may bee taken from
him, by publike, or priuate
enemies; his children may
by sicknesse put on ashes
for beautie, and become the
children of death, yea of

Belial. Let him therefore
build his hopes on these
things, as men vse to build
scaffolds for spectacles, eue~
with a certaine expectation
of taking downe when the
spectacle is ended. Let him
vse the world as if he vsed
it not, or as readie not to
vse it; because the forme of
the world passeth away.
When Gods prouidence
calles, we must looke for
their departure; and if thus
expected to depart, they
fall from vs ripe, and are not
pulled from vs as greene;
but if not expected, they
depart as things glewde to
the hart, which teares away
some of the heart at par|ting.
Thus not vsing this
world as a place of certain|ty

and rest (which it is not)
yet let vs vse it as a Nurce|ry
and Schoole for heauen,
which it is. Let vs learne
here of the Spirit, of the
word, of the sacraments, of
affliction, and euen of the
generall condition of the
world it selfe; For since the
world is so full of miserie,
incertainty, and vanity, it
teacheth vs to set our affe|ctions
on another world,
euen that continuing Citie
which is aboue, heauenly
Ierusalem, where is stabili|ty,
perpetuity, and glory in|coprehensible.
Let vs pray,
let vs striue in this world to
be fitted, to be trimmed, for
that world, as abride for the
wedding-chamber, though
through a thousand chan|ges,

a thousand crosses; for
if wee become inwardly
faire, the King of heauen
will haue pleasure in our
beauty; we shall be crow|ned
with a crowne of ioy
immarcessible, we shall be
filled with the glory of
God, and the blessednesse
of his presence, which is
perfit happinesse.


57
Consisting of eight parts.

I. Part.
There is one (otherwise
wise inough for a sonne of
the old Adam) takes vpon
him to measure the Ocean
of Gods wisedome flowing
in the mystery of mans sal|uation,

with the cockelshell
of his owne wit, and accor|dingly
with his iudgement
he walkes ouer the length
and breadth thereof, laying
his high and mighty cen|sure
vpon it. The honestie
of Diuines he debaseth, and
preferreth that of the Phi|losopher:
the religion of
Palestine hee condemnes,
but commends the Chri|stian
religion as a thing
well contriued. Yet his
commendations seeme not
to be heartie, since vnder
them there passe from him
certaine vndermining sen|tences,
which strike at the
maine Pillars of that which
he commends. The odious
comparison of the Christi|stian
and Mahumetane re|ligions,

because the Ma|humetane
succeedeth the
Christia~, in the pretence of
a greater perfection, as the
Christian doth the Iudai|call,
may passe the more vn|resisted
because it is apt of
it selfe to fall. For it easily
appeares that therein the
diuel was lesse then Christs
Ape, mentioning only and
not performing an imitati|on.
For Christ hath really
out-gone the Law: First, he
hath iustly abolished the
types and shadowes there|of,
by bringing in the sub|stance
and things them|selues.
Secondly he hath
taken away the ignorance
vnder the Law, by giuing
such a knowledge, that the
least in his kingdome is

greater then the greatest vn|der
the Law: and thirdly, he
hath amended the weake|nesse
of the Law, by giuing
strength to his seruants to
performe what the Law be|fore
could onely teach. But
in which of these points
hath Mahomet made any
probable progresse beyond
Christ? Types and shadows
of future things he cannot
take away; for there are
none in the Christian Reli|gion.
Ignorance, hee is so
farre fro~ amending, that he
is the very man that dark|neth
counsell by words
without knowledge; wee
heare of fables and vnlikely
visions, but in sum, hee for|biddeth
knowledge, hateth
the light,  al examination

of his religion. Lastly, in+stead
of strengthening men
in the accomplishing of the
Law, hee weakeneth them,
by giuing them the satisfa|ction
of lust in polygamie;
and impossible it is he can
goe beyond Christ in any
precept of holinesse, who
commands vs to loue and
serue God with al our soule
and all our strength, and
more then all can no man
giue. So doth Mahomet
onely speake of perfection,
but performeth it not.


2. Part.
But with two points es|pecially
he seems to wound
the Christian Religion,
though like a Parthian
looking another way: One
is while he iudgeth it a loth|some

thing that God shold
bee satisfied and appeased
with bloud: which though
it seeme mainly to bee bent
against common sacrifices,
yet being spoken without
exception (as it is there) it
striketh at the very sacri|fice
of Christ performed in
bloud; and that there was
such a meaning this also
addeth probability, because
in his directions of Pietie
while he speaketh of sacrifi|ces,
hee aduiseth not his
pious or godly man to
make himselfe acceptable
to his Creator, by the com|memoration
of any such
bloudy sacrifice, but being
altogether silent in that
point, he saith, the most ab|solute
sacrifice is a pure,

true and humble heart. A
second is while he iudgeth
it a strange thing that the
Spirit of God should be in
fraile, weake, and vnperfect
men. Yea he seemeth to ex|clude
him from all men: for
he saith, where the spirit is,
it would produce some
strange effects, as the re|moouing
of mountaines; it
wold appeare in the whole
course of man, and nothing
in the world could shake
vs.


3. Part.
To answer these things
first in the roote: The very
roote of this kinde of say|ings
and misbeleefes, is the
naturall wisedome of man,
which is indeede folly. For
it selfe thinking wisely of it

selfe, and making it selfe the
measure of all things, yea
of the Diuinity it selfe, it
contracteth or disposeth,
that, and all other things
according to its owne mea|sure
and iudgement. But
herein are two faults; The
one is: Because the wise|dome
of man, at the best is
narrow and shallow, in re|gard
of the wisedome of
God, and cannot pierce vn|to
the depth, or compre|hend
the breadth of that
which is deeper and larger
then it selfe: yea in familiar
and daily things, our wise|dome
lyeth downe, being
dazled and amazed. So that
if God please to set forth
any deepe iudgement or
wisedome of his, it is be|yond

 without our iudge|ments;
therefore can they
see nothing therein, but ra|ther
are offended with it.
Then the truly wise man
cryeth out with Saint Paul:
O the depth of the iudge|ments
of God! and so lea|ueth
with admiration; and
then the foolish wise man
saith, That which he com|prehendeth
not, is not, but
that the very wisedome of
God is foolishnesse: Ano|ther
fault is, because our
wisedome besides the shal|lownesse
and narrownesse
thereof, is corrupted and
peruerted: The flesh lyeth
on the soule, as a finger vp|on
the strings of a Lute, and
makes it to sound, speake
 to be wise, according to

the nature of that which
stoppeth it. Now the flesh
hath this corruption in it,
that it is auerted from God
our true soueraigne good,
 turneth to the creature,
setting her happinesse ther|on:
This it soundeth still
vnto the vnderstanding on
which it lyeth; this way it
turneth stiffely the will, so
that the wisedome of God,
which teacheth the contra|ry
is lothsome to it, it is ha|ted
and condemned of it.
And ouercome with these
two infirmities, it seemes
this man hath by them ex|amined
these great myste|ries
of God: Whereas by
strong mortification of this
fleshly wisedome, and the
helpe of the Spirit obtained

by earnest Prayer, hunger
and thirst, the flesh beeing
made quiet  vnmoouing,
and the Spirit opening the
blind eyes of his, and our
soules, hee and we might
perceiue a high wisedome
in these matters of God, yea
and we shall perceiue the
reason why wee could not
before perceiue them.


4. Part.
But particularly to an|swer
the branches: For the
first, there is no reason why
God should bee imagined
without iustice, and why iu|stice
should be considered
without a will of punishing
faults, and why the punish|ment
of faults committed
against God the chiefest es|sence,
shold not be a chiefe

punishment euen of bloud
and death, which is allow|ed
for offences against men.
And proportionably belee|uing
mercie to bee in the
same God, we may reasona|bly
beleeue that mercy may
take the punishment of one
for another, this other bee|ing
vnited to that one, and
so consequently, the pu|nishment
beeing one the
same, they both being made
one. Againe if there may be
such a sacrifice of one for a|nother,
why should not the
bloud of beasts, serue to
teach men that sacrifice vn|to
their eternall preseruati|on,
aswell as bee daily shed
for their temporall nourish|ment,
man being their end,
 God their Creator, who

therefore may appoint this
vse of them, vnto man as
well as the other? Now for
the second branch, that the
Spirit of God would shew
wonderfull effects: First
who hath tyed God to giue
such a measure of his Spirit
as this man listeth? But it is
still in the hands of God to
dispose his gifts in his own
measure. If it please him he
may separate the gift of san|ctification
from the gift of
miracles, giuing one  not
the other: yea in very san|ctification
hee may kindle
vs sometimes as flaxe that
doth but smoake: and shall
I say then, that except I see
the flame I will not beleeue
that there is any fire? Yet
his graces in many are so

strong, that they are plainly
apparant, and cry out loud|ly,
the power of God,  not
of ma~. For is it not a power
euidently supernatural, that
men truly possessed of their
wits, seeing and willing,
fight, subdue and forsake
their owne deerest affecti|ons,
and sweetest pleasures,
which they see and feele;
yea, leaue the world, and
life it selfe, to please God
whom they see not, to serue
him, to obtaine him: where
as the generall world, yea,
and the wisest of them
doth cleane contrary? Doth
not this shew they are mo|ued
with a spirit different
from the spirit of the world,
yea,  contrary to it, which
is a diuine Spirit? For

nothing but God can turne
mans hart vnto God, being
naturally fixed and nailed
to the world.


Part. 5.
But true it is, that God
hath so disposed of this
grace, that he leaueth in vs
infirmity still to combat
with it, and sometimes to
quaile it for a time. The rea|sons
hereof are diuers: first,
hee will get glory by our
weaknes; for we being in a
fight with our neerest flesh,
and the next world, and the
diuell, the Prince of this
world; strong, mighty and
ouermatching enemies; the
glorie must needs bee his, if
wee that are too weake for
them, ouercome them. And
againe, the lesse power hee

performes the victory with|all,
the more is his glory; for
thereby it appeareth, that
the weaknesse of God is
stronger then the strength
of Satan. Again, this world
is a place appointed by him
to bee blotted out, and ac|cordingly
it is to man a
place of vnrest, of fighting,
of striuing; his rest is aboue,
his victorie is aboue. Ther|fore
God setteth vs not
here in a steady, victorious,
and glorious grace, lest with
Peter wee should desire to
build Tabernacles heere,
where the foundations
must bee remooued: but
hee keepeth rest, triumph,
and glorie for vs in the
world to come, wherein
is the perfect rest, euen

the pure Sabbath of God.
Then shall it apparantly be
his glorie, that hee hath
made so small a seede of
grace, to bring foorth such
a haruest of glorie; and that
with Manna, which to car|nall
men seemeth a light
bread, he bringeth men to
Canaan, euen the land of
rest and happinesse.


6. Part.
Now to returne him
some trafficke for his obser|uations,
three notes and
markes I will here set vpon
carnall wise men, each of
them being an imperfecti|on,
which spoiles their dis|coursing
of Diuinitie, and
Christ the chiefe part ther|of;
euen the ignorance of

three things, which few of
them haue the knowledge
to see, consider, and con|fesse,
yet are they certainely
true, and truly shewed in the
doctrine of Christ, and
therefore commends this
doctrine aboue all other.
One is the storie of mans
fall, a true and vnmoueable
ground of Christian Religi|on,
and whereon Christ ne|cessarily
is to be brought in
to satisfie for the faults, and
to rectifie the crookednesse
thereof. Now this is mani|fest
to vs, only by the word
of life, yet it is necessarily in|forced
on any cleare vnder|standing.
For it may be ea|sily
seene and belieued, that
a creature so wicked, so
blind, so subiect to euery

passion and vice, was neuer
let out, as he now is, from
the hands of a most wise,
and powerfull essence; and
that to gouerne a great
world, whereof hee is not
worthy, as he is, to be a par|tie,
he being so extremely
vitious and corrupt, and
most creatures being more
orderly then himselfe.


7. Part.
Againe, another folly
and blindnesse of theirs is,
that they see not the resur|rection:
it is impossible, that
the end of mans bodie
should bee this present life.
For then might we say with
these Author, that there
might be some pleasure ta|ken
aboue in the torments
here below. For what gene|rally

doe wee see here but
miseries, paines, oppression,
diuers tortures, diuers
deaths, diuers heart-brea|kings,
care within, and la|bour
without: a few onely
liuing in some ease, of
which again but a few scape
a great taste of miserie. In|deed,
were there no life but
this, we might verily think
that man was appointed to
be borne, to liue and die in
a Iayle, wherein hee is tied
and bound vp to miserie;
and that this world was set
forth for a spectacle of tor|ments
 massacres: where|in
wee should infinitely
wrong the infinite wisdom
and goodnesse of the great
cause of al things. But as we
haue learnd of God our own

fall and present miserie, so
withall wee haue learned a
remedie for our fall, and a
way out of this miserie into
felicitie. We know and be|lieue,
that the bodie dying,
returnes into that which it
was, and that is dust; and if
being dust at first, it was
then quickned; wee know
hee that quickned dust at
first, can quicken dust at
last, hee being the same for
euer; yea, wee know that
small portion of his Spirit
which is in vs, is abundant|ly
able to performe it. Wee
doubt not, but a little pow|er
included in an Acorne, is
able to raise out of it a
mightie Oake, because wee
see it; and we may as easily
belieue, that this Spirit

which now shewes a farre
greater power in our sancti|fication,
may also raise out
of our dust, a heauenly and
glorious bodie. To him
that hath done so great
workes daily seene, there
wanteth no power to do as
great things yet vnseene.
For God hath not bounded
his power by his works, but
if his wil be to worke more,
his power is still sufficient
to proceede in working.
Now that it is his will, his
word doth plainely shew:
blessed bee hee, who hath
both willed it, and shewed
it; and God, the Author of
these and all other good
gifts, stablish vs which be|long
to him, in the know|ledge
and embracement of

this his sauing truth, that
liuing and dying therein,
we may passe from this life,
which is worse then death,
vnto a true life of blisse and
happinesse.


Part. 8.
Another thing which
flesh and blood hath not
fully discouered, and which
hath been the author both
of our fall and miserie, and
implieth a necessitie of a
preseruer and redeemer; is
a State, body politicke, and
kingdome of euill spirits,
which effectuall in craft,
mightie in power, diligent
in watchfulnesse: and ha|uing
all these their powers
emploied and moued by an
endles and great malice to|wards
ma~kind, go stil about

seeking the mischiefe and
ruine of weak  silly man,
vnable of himselfe to stand
against this Leuiathan; and
therefore necessarily wan|ting
the helpe of a preseruer
and redeemer. Without a
preseruer we cannot preuent
the euils to come; for against
so mighty enemies, we must
bee hedged about with a
prouidence mightier then
the force of our enemies; els
can we not be safe from our
enemies, but shold be conti|nually
deuoured by them.
And we neede a redeemer,
for y^e euils already by these
enemies brought vpon vs:
for these euils we our selues
can by no meanes take
from our selues, nor free
our selues from the ty|ranny

which Satan hath
alreadie brought vpon vs.
Therefore this strong man
must bee bound by some
stronger then himselfe, and
so we which were before
his possession, may be made
free from that bondage.
Now the highest power
only is master of this pow|er
of darknesse; and there|fore
he only must performe
this worke. Some short and
small viewes of some out|ward,
bodily and dissem|bled
workings of these
Principalities, the Heathen
haue obserued in their sto|ries
of witchcrafts, oracles,
and apparitions; which wit|nesse
against themselues;
that there are such a people,
and that at times they are

very mischieuous and ma|licious;
but the craft of this
kingdome is so great,  the
ignorance of man so grosse,
that sometimes vnder the
shew of doing good, as cures
and the like, and sometimes
by foretelling future euents
(so hiding still their princi|pall
malice, which was to
the soule and eternall life of
man) they haue won silly
men to take them for gods,
who are their sworne and
most fierce enemies: so farre
are men from knowing,
they are a kingdome com|bined
against mankind.
But Christ by his doctrine,
and the doctrine of his ser|uants
the Apostles, hath
described them by name,
hath shewed their nature,

hath set foorth their ma|lice
and rage against man,
which begunne with the
first man, and continu|ing
from thence increase
now towardes the last
of men. Hee hath al|so
set foorth a remedie
against all his hurt and
power, and that is euen
in this flesh which in the
first man the Diuell con|quered.
For God will shew
to his owne glorie, and
the vtter confusion of this
proud  malicious Prince,
that by that verie weake
creature, which no way
heeretofore was not a|ble
to match with him,
God is able to breake his
head, if hee doe but v|nite
and ioyne himselfe

therewith. And that of
these men which thus were
in the first man foyled
and ouercome, hee is a|ble
to set vp a kingdome
mighty and durable, which
shall stand invincible in
this world against the
powerfull kingdome of
Satan, and the vnpreuai|ling
gates of hell, and
shall at last (ouercomming
these mightie enemies)
passe victorious vnto glo|rie
and life euerlasting.
Euen this performe in vs
O Lord thy weake ser|uants:
weake in our selues,
but strong in thee. Let
thy power in vs, ouer|come
that power, which
without thee, would o|uercome
vs. And let vs

being strengthned by thee,
march valiantly against our
enemies, being assured of
conquest, through that
mightie one who loueth
and supporteth vs.



58
The end seemes to vs to
bee caused by the meanes,
and so at last it is; but the
end is indeed first, and most
chiefely the cause of the
meanes: for God propo|sing
his end, this end caleth
out such meanes, as shall
accomplish it selfe, so that
it causeth that to be, which
causeth it selfe. So in the
Scripture, when diuers
things happened, it is said,
that they happened, that it
might bee fulfilled, which
God had before purposed:

so that Gods purpose was
the cause of the beeing of
those actions which fulfil|led
his purpose. Therefore
if we go to the roote of the
matter, wee may perceiue
that foolishly wee reason,
when we are discontented
with the meanes, saying, If
this meanes had not beene,
this action had not come
to passe; whereas we should
reason this, If this action
had not beene appointed
to come to passe, these effe|ctual
meanes had not falne
out. Then run we to see the
true cause of things, euen
to Gods prouidence and
purpose, which to the god|ly
is a sure rest and refuge,
since therby al euents must
turne to the best to Gods

children, though effected
by the malice and wicked|nesse
of men. For this pur|pose
of God is rooted in
Loue, and loue purposeth
all for the good of that
which it loueth: so through
whatsoeuer kinde of acti|ons
it passeth, it still remai|neth
one  vnchangeable,
bringing forth stedfastly
fruit proportionable to the
roote of loue. Gods pur|pose
cannot be hindered or
altered by men, but passeth
along conquering and pre|uailing,
vnchanged it selfe
and changing all things, to
it selfe, and it owne good|nesse:
So Shimei his cursing
might produce a blessing
to Dauid, and Iudas treason
did procure the saluation

of mankinde.


59
Consisting of Parts.

1. Part.
It is a strange thing that
in this broad day light, any
man should stumble at the
Popes supremacy in spiritu|all,
much lesse in temporall
matters. If with the Apo|stles
wee will but testifie
what we see, we on whom
the truth clearely shineth
cannot chuse but see that
this supremacy is a thing
much yonger then the
Christian Religion; which
prospered before it was,
and that much better then
since Religion was put out

to nurse vnto it. If we will
begin with Christ, Christ
equally endoweth his A|postles
with power of bin|ding
and loosing; and e|qually
appoints al nations
vnto them. If Christ should
haue said, That on Peter
he would build his Church
(which he speaketh of him
only who only is the Rock,
1. Cor. 10.) yet Peter answe|ring
for all, should receiue
this in the behalfe of all, for
whom hee answered. For
since it was forbidden to
all of the~ to tell who Christ
was, it seemes all ioyned
with Peter in the knowledg
and confession of Christ,
and so all had interest in the
benefit of that knowledge
and confession. Againe, if

at that time it should only
haue beene spoken only to
Peter, wee haue another
Scripture which equalleth
the other Apostles with
him, euen in the building
of the Church; while it say|eth,
the Church is built vp|on
the foundation of the
Apostles: so that the Apo|stles
are ioyned together
promiscuously, not diffe|rently,
towards the making
vp of the foundation. Be|sides,
Paul plainely answe|reth
that he is not a whit in|feriour
to the chiefest of
the Apostles; that he had of
Peter the right hand of
fellowship, not of infe|riority:
 which most cuts
off the Pope from claiming
vs who are Gentiles by Pe|ter,

and turnes him ouer to
fetch his especiall claime
by Paul, Paul saith that the
Apostleship of the circum|cision
or Iewes was com|mitted
to Peter, and of the
Gentiles especially to him:
To this Eusebius giues his
testimony, saying, that Pe|ter
though co~ming among
the Gentiles, yet preached
only to the Iewes,  with|all
brings forth his first E|pistle,
as that which was di|rected
particularly to his
own charge the Iewes. And
this indeede best fitteth
with the History, which re|porteth,
that Peter and Paul
exercised their Apostleships
together at Rome, which
might most orderly be per|formed,
if the one taught

there the Circumcisio~; the
other the Gentiles. There|fore
let the Pope take heed
how he robs Paul, to giue
vnto Peter; for hee robbes
his best title, to giue to his
worse; but hereafter let him
find some new exposition
of building the Church so
vpon Peter; that Paul also
may haue a great part in
the foundation wheron the
Church is built. Now if we
descend from the Apostles
(betweene whome if there
be any oddes in right to vs,
it appeares to be on Paules
side) to examine whether a|ny
such supremacy descen|ded
from among them, to
the succeeding ages, wee
shall finde none in diuers
hundred years. The church

of Rome indeede was a fa|mous
Church, founded by
the Apostles, flourishing
with godly Bishops and
Martyrs, and full of Saints;
and therefore by many ho|ly
men, great and large ti|tles
were giuen to her, and
her Bishops, in letters and
writings. So might shee for
the eminencie thereof, be
called the first Church or
the chiefest Church, and
the Bishops, the Bishops of
the chiefest Church; but a
meane vndersta~ding knows
there is great oddes, be|tweene
being first in order,
and a head in gouernment.
And this the practise of
those times plainly decla|red;
for though they had
giuen neuer so many good

words to the Bishops and
Church of Rome, yet as
soone as the Bishop of
Rome intermedled with
their gouernment, they
prese~tly rose vp against him:
so did Cyprian; yea a coun|cell
of African Bishops, and
among them Saint Austin,
walled vp their countrey
from the command of the
Romane Bishops. Euen in
the very matter of excom|munication,
wherein is the
pretented emine~ce of their
power, Irenaeus a Bishop of
France  the Popes neigh|bour,
reprooued Victor, a
Bishop of Rome for exco~|municating
the Churches
of Asia vpon the obseruati|on
of Easter. And when
Constantinus vniustly chec|ked

Liberius the Bishop of
Rome for maintaining the
cause of Athanasius with
these words, How great a
part of the world art thou,
that thou alone shouldest
iustifie a wicked man, and
trouble the peace of the
world? neither Constantinus
acknowledged any supre|macy
in Liberius: neither
did Liberius in his answer
(though hee had occasion
giuen to tell how great and
Catholike a head hee was)
thereby iustifie his doings.
To conclude, (for particu|lars
are infinite, and this
matter is commonly hand|led;)
at length by a councel,
Christendome was com|mitted
to fiue Patriarches;
of Rome, Constantinople,

Alexandria, Antioch, and
Ierusalem: of which Rome
was the first, but had no
more authoritie ouer the
rest, then the second had o|uer
the third; the authoritie
of no one being subalterne,
or subiect to other. And the
proportionable practise of
diuers of these Patriarches
yet standing, giueth here|unto
confirmation. But the
same corruption of mans
nature, which in a clowne
stirreth vp an ambitious de|sire
to be a gentleman, of a
gentleman to become a
nobleman, and of a noble|man
to become a king; be|ing
in a Pope as much as in
other men, hath wrought
the same effect in him, that
it hath in others. And so

from being a Patriarch he
hath laboured to bee the
head of the Patriarches,
that is, an vniuersall Patri|arch;
and from being and v|niuersall
Patriarch, to be an
vniuersall Emperour. So
Ambition still ascends, ma|king
one degree of honor,
but a stayre whereon to
mount it selfe vp to ano|ther;
and by this meanes at
length hee is come to that
all-comprehending toppe
wherin he meetes iust with
the title prepared for him
by Saint Paul: As God, in
the temple of God, aboue
al that is called God. But he
must remember that there|unto
are annexed these two
other titles, the man of sin,
and the sonne of perdition.



2. Part.
These things beeing so
euident, most lamentable
it is that there should bee
plotted and deuised an ig|norance
so grosse that it
seeth them not; that there
should bee miracles by the
diuell wrought or forged to
stand betweene the eyes of
men, and this reuealed An|tichrist:
that there should
be distinctions coined sub|till
enough for lesse subtill
soules, to distinguish to the
manifest Antichrist from it
selfe. Yet all these things are
prouided by the seruants of
this sonne of perdition,
and so powerfull, that it
is Gods election onely
which mainely preserues
those that stand and with|stands

this Mysterie of
Satan. And indeede how
can that ignorance, which
is inioyned to the disciples
of Rome, be broke~ through
by them, which are bound
thereunto by a solemne
vow, and vnder feareful pe|nalties?
They must know
but what deceiueth them,
vntill they be so throughly
deceiued, that it is almost
impossible to bee vndecei|ued
againe. But this let
them take with it, that the
same ignorance will serue
to breede vp a man in any
religio~, be it neuer so grosse;
and at this day it equally
serues the diuels turne to
nurse two of his goodliest
children, the erroneous do|ctrines
of Mahomet and the

Pope. Yet lest ignorance
should faile, and perchance
a glimse of light might
shine in vpon the seeled
eies, there are miracles dai|ly
prouided to set before
the sight of men. These
draw them to say, that Si|mon
Magus is the great
power of God: but wee are
taught to goe from these
signes to the Law, to the
Testimony, to the Word;
and this Word telleth vs,
that miracles in the latter
times, shall be fixed and vn|separable
companions of
the man of sin. So in stead
of conuerting vs, they are
acknowledged by vs, to be
the badge of Satan, fastned
on Antichrists sleeue, and
they tell vs to whom he be|longs.

Wee neede no mi|racles
now, but to reueale
Antichrist; for wee beleeue
the doctrine of Christ once
fully confirmed by his own
miracles. Lastly, if yet some
greater light dazle the eies,
which neither ignorance
can keepe out, nor miracles
employ in drawing the eies
wholly to themselues; then
are there prouided subtill,
nice, and sublimated distin|ctions
and reasons, whose
office is to confound and
intangle the vnderstanding
rather then to enlighten it.
Falshoods are purified and
refined, and made as like
truths, as possibly they may,
that the vndistinguishing
mind may equally accept
them, and so led by a little

mistaking vnto a grosse er|ror.
And hereof at this time
is there a stedy forge in the
Church of Rome, which
doth but expect what the
Pope and his Priuie Coun|cell
say, and instantly they
are ready with their excel|lent
inuentions, to prooue
it the voice of God, and not
of man. Surely the wit of
man is a powerfull thing in
regard of man; but in re|gard
of the Spirit which
made it, alas weake it is, and
the effect cannot striue
with his cause, which is
mightier then he. There|fore
this Babel of mans wit
built vp against the Lord,
must needs be destroied by
the Spirit of his mouth. In
the meane time vntill this

victory of Christ vpon An|tichrist
be fully performed,
let vs pray vnto God, that
he will adde easily vnto the
Church, those who belong
vnto him; and that they
may plainely see, that hee
who seeketh earthly things
more then heauenly, is of
the earth, earthly, and farre
from being the Deputie of
the Lord of heauen.



60
The second resurrection
needes not to seeme very
strange, if wee consider the
first, already done in vs; for
whereas there is naturally
in vs but a carnall wisedom,
that seeth and alloweth on|ly
present  visible things
for happinesse, wee haue in
our regeneration, a wise|dome

placed in vs, which
blotting out the former
wisedome, and the happi|nesse
thereof, beholdeth
God which is inuisible, as
our onely true happinesse.
We haue also in stead of our
fleshly will, which onely sa|uoureth
fleshly obiects, a
will directly contrary ther|unto
planted in stead of it,
which hateth the former
will, and the sinful pleasures
wherein that wil chiefly de|lighted;
and loueth euen
the persecutions of Christ,
which the naturall will es|pecially
hated. Thus by the
new birth, light being crea|ted
in darknesse out of no
former creature,  a right|nesse
of will being framed,
where was nothing but

crookednesse, and such a
light and will, that they al|ter
the affections, actions,
 whole course of ma~; why
may not the same new birth
haue also another power
with it, euen to change the
mortalitie of the body into
immortality, as it hath to
change the corruption of
the soule and body into pu|ritie
 incorruption? it be|ing
alike easie to go to giue
life vnto death, as light vnto
darknes, and good to euill.


61
Because wee see not
God, or at lest we do not see
how he seeth vs, wee rather
thinke that he sees vs not,
or are careles of his seeing:
So our blindnesse toward
God, casteth the likenesse
of it selfe, on God towards

vs, and imagineth him to
bee vnto vs, as we are to
him. Herein men are to
God, as some birds are to
men, who hiding their
heads from seeing men,
think that men the whilest
doe not see them. But since
the knowledge of God is
the cause of men, the being
of men can reach no far|ther,
then the knowledge
of God. So whosoeuer
takes the knowledge of
God from him, takes
from himselfe his owne be|ing;
for where the know|ledge
of God ceaseth to
know him, there he ceaseth
to bee; otherwise should
man, who is but the effect
of Gods knowledge go far|der
then his cause, which

cannot be. But surely God
that made ma~ by his know|ledge,
knoweth the man
that he hath made; he hath
not placed him out of his
owne reach; but as at first
after he made his creatures,
he saw euen through them,
that they were throughly
good; so for euer, he veweth
and pierceth them, search|ing
all things by that very
wisedom which made the~.
Since then we are manifest
and naked, before our glo|rious
God, who both seeth,
and hateth all vncleannes,
but beholdeth with plea|sure,
holinesse and purenes;
let vs take heede to our
hearts, yea, our whole
selues, that no filthinesse
appeare to him, lest we bee

shut out from the City into
which no vncleane thing
may enter: But that God
seeing vs to be pure in hart,
euen in soule  body, may
at length be called vp to see
God, who is the fulnesse
and perfection of all felici|tie.


62
The very being as well
as the discoursing of our
naturall reason may well
prooue, that man was not
made onely for this world.
For if first it be granted, that
a great and excellent wise|dome
created this Vniuerse
which the curious subtiltie
of the parts and frame ther|of
will inforce vpon vs; it
must also be belieued, that
wisedome doth all things

wisely, both in regard of
order, and end, euery thing
bringing forth his like: now
the beasts hauing a more
easie and vninterrupted en|ioying
of the world, as not
tilling, or reaping, neither
building Barnes nor filling
the~; not foreapprehending
griefes, nor long retaining
them? what doth this rea|sonable
soule in man (I
speake of the generall) if his
bound be this world, but
teach him how to labour,
how to vexe himselfe, and
how to grieue, and conse|quently
how to bee more
miserable then the beasts
themselues? But a soule
more excellent then the
beasts cannot be imagined
to be giuen for this vse by

so perfect a wisedome, it be|ing
extremely contrary vn|to
wisdome, that the beasts
shold serue a creature more
base and miserable then
themselues; that man shold
be both aboue them, and
below them: and that man
should haue reason, thereby
to be worse then he should
be without it. Therefore it
strongly followeth, that
this aduantage of reason
was giuen by wisedome to
man, for some aduantage of
man. And if beasts enioy
the world as much as man,
and yet man hath a soule
more excellent then they;
that this soule hath some
happines aboue the world,
which is the especiall end
and marke thereof. To this

happinesse therfore, let our
soule lift it selfe vp that it
may verily tend toward the
end thereof, that it be not a
meere drudge vnto labour
and misery, sinking downe
below the beasts, but that
reaching beyond them, it
lay hold on that blessed re|freshing
which is to come,
and comfort it selfe amid
all the base imployments,
labours and toyles of the
sixe daies, in the view of the
happy Sabbath and rest of
God, the true aime of her
desires, and the chiefe so|lace
that swallowes and
sweetens all her temporall
vexations.

The diuel vsually raiseth
temptations out of the

state which is present, and
therefore though wee bee
past one da~ger, into a calme
and quietnesse, yet euen
then looke that out of that
calme, also some tentation
will arise. He is more cun|ningly
and industriously
mischieuous, the~ his schol|ler
the Papist: One Treason
being past wee may not
thinke it the last, but one a|mong
the rest, and so looke
for his fellowes; if we haue
scaped, we must pray, hope,
and endeauour to scape a|gaine.
Our life is a warfare,
which is not a single bat|taile,
but a continuance of
many. If the diuell haue
lost, he is the more angrie
for loosing, and surely in
this last time of the world

as hee is more cholericke
and fierce then euer, so is
he more cunning. He hath
man at his fingers ends, and
this his increased know|ledge,
hee sets on worke
by an increased malice,
desiring because his time is
short, to get in breadth
what he cannot in length.
It concernes vs therefore
proportionably to increase
our resistance; and if wee
meane to ouercome, by
prayer, watchfulnesse, and
industry, so to aduance our
selues in the power of
Christ, that we may ouer|match
the power of Satan;
that the house of Dauid
growing stronger, and the
house of Saul weaker, the
kingdome of Christ the

Sonne of Dauid may bee
throughly and firmely esta|blished
in vs, and we in it.


64
A dissembler  hypo|crite,
is a thing most odious
to God, and so should he be
to men, especially to him|selfe,
who next to God
knowes best how wicked
himselfe is. First, he is a per|petuall
lyer,  his outward
profession, is nothing but a
continuall publisher, and
perswader of vntruth. It tels
euery one the man is ho|nest
that shewes it, and lies
all the while. This lying in
deeds, is at least as wicked
as lying in words,  accor|dingly
should be hated. A|gaine
the dissembler is an
idolater, for he sets man in
the place of God, and God

in the place of man. His
best side he shewes to man,
 that is his outside; and
the worst side, he turnes to
God, and that is his heart:
Accursed man that seekest
to please him who is but
thy fellow, and neglectest
him who made both thee
and him, euen the Almigh|tie,
Lord of all things. That
God who is ielous and will
not giue his honour to an|other,
cannot but be high|ly
offended with thee, for
preferring man before him;
and to him shalt thou giue
an account for this corrup+tion
and withdrawing of
thy heart, Gods chiefest
part. Thirdly, the dissem|bler
is an idoll, for he being
nothing in the world sta~ds

vp to bee worshipped. By
his outward shew he calles
in the countrey to reue|rence
him for the goodnes
which is not in him, he sets
himselfe vp on horse-backe
as Haman wold haue done,
his hollow profession cry|ing
before him; This is the
man, whom God will ho|nour.
But this man, the
whiles is the very man
whome God especially ha|teth,
and whom with Da|gon
he will cast downe on
the threshold of hell gates,
breaking him in pieces,
when none shall deliuer
him. And this fits wel with
him, for now hee is not a
whole man; but pieces of
two men tied together, the
outward piece is a piece of

an honest man; the other
and that the greater piece,
is a piece of a Reprobate, or
rather of a diuell. Lastly, he
is a very foole, for of that
which is good hee chuseth
onely to haue the appea|rance,
and of that which is
naught to haue, a full and
whole possession. Thou
foole, if the shew of good|nesse
be so good, is not the
thing it selfe much more
good?  if the shew of wic|kednes
be odious, is not the
wickednesse it selfe much
more odious? But thou vn|wisely
art contented to be
rotten, corrupt, and filthy,
so the world see nothing in
thee, but an outward pain|ting
of purity, and clean|nesse;
so thou maist be to

them a perfume, thou wilt
be to thy selfe a kennel. But
rather turne from thy wic|kednesse,
and liue; get the
reall possession of that,
whereof the very appea|rance
is so beautifull and
pleasant; let the shew make
thee in loue with the thing,
 get a roote to thy bran|ches.
Otherwise thy vizard
shall bee pulled from thee,
and thou shalt bee stript of
thy shewes,  be condem|ned
for that which thou
art. Thou shalt be far away
from these whom thou re|presentest,
and shalt be pla|ced
among such as thou art
indeede: there shal be taken
from thee, that which it
seemes thou hast, and thou
shalt bee cast into vtter

darkenesse. Surely if to men
the looking asquint of the
eies, be ill fauoured and vn|pleasant,
much more ougly
vnto God is this squinting
of the soule while it casts
the eye on goodnesse, but
the sight on wickednesse:
Therefore reconcile thy
self to thy selfe, become one
man and differ not in thy
selfe: for if thou agree with
thy selfe, bringing thy in|side
to be one with thy out|side,
then wil God agree w^t
thee, and this saying shall
concerne thee aswell as o|thers:
Blessed are the pure
in heart for they shall see
God. But if thou plough
on with thy oxe and asse
together, thou goest on in
that, which is an abhomi|nation

to the Lord, thou
heapest vp wrath against
the day of wrath; thou hast
no portio~ in y^e blessednesses
which belo~g to the right e|ous,
but in y^e many woes de|nounced
against y^e Scribes
 Pharisies Hypocrites.


65
That image  Chara|cter
w^c euery man beares in
this life, the same also shall
he beare in the resurrectio~.
He that in this life beareth
the image of God, shall in y^e
resurrection appeare in that
image;  he y^t beares only
the image of darkenesse 
corruption, euen the like|nesse
of the old Adam, in
the same lothsome and de|formed
shape shall hee ap|peare
before God sitting in
iudgement. For God doth

regenerate and new create
man onely in this world.
They that be not changed
here, and made like vnto
Christ, doe let passe the
time of Regeneration, and
so they haue the stampe of
sinne in their foreheads vn|remooueable
for euer. Now
in that great and terrible
day, what difference shall
there be in the twofold ap|parance
of these different
sorts? The sonne of God
new made by his Spirit, shal
appeare in the image and
likenes of God his Father,
with light in his vnder|standing,
righteousnesse in
his will, and holinesse in his
affections: To him it shall
be said, Blessed is the pure
in heart, he shal see God; for

God delighteth to see him,
euen his owne likenesse in
him. But the sonne of flesh
shall appeare, foule and ble|mished
in his vnderstan|ding,
corrupt and froward
in his will and affections;
and in stead of representing
hee shall bee contrarie and
crosse vnto God, and ougly
in his co~trarietie. And then
is his very presence lothsom
to the Iudge of purest eies,
he is a toad or serpent made
and taken to bee destroied.
His ouglinesse kindleth the
wrath of God against him,
which burneth and driueth
into the bottom of hell;
Lord, when thou raisest vs
vp, thou shalt make their I|mage
despised. Therefore
while it is to day, while it

is the accepted time, let the
sonne of man make hast to
become the sonne of God;
Let him put off the goate
which he is, and put on the
sheepe that he should bee;
let him get a cleane heart,
and a right spirit within
him. And because this on|ly
commeth of God, let vs
seeke onely to him; and be|cause
God hath told vs by
his Sonne that he will be o|uercome
by importunitie,
let vs seeke importunately
stil begging, following, and
vndeniably soliciting him,
vntill hee giue the holy
Ghost to them that aske
him. Then shall wee with
Symeon, bee full of peace at
our departure, being assu|red
to see saluation; there

shall wee with Paul, bee al|waies
bold euen at our re|moouing,
being certaine of
a better tabernacle in hea|uen;
then shall wee com|fortably
approch to the
Throne of God, who wee
know will acknowledge vs
for sonnes by his marke in
our foreheads, and will call
vs in vnto the Supper of the
Lamb. But then they y^t ap|peare
in the shape of dogs,
their place shall be without
from the presence of God
and the Lambe for euer|more,
where their worme
dieth not, and their fire
quencheth not. They that
are the kindreds of the
earth, and not of heauen,
shall waile before God, and
theirs shall be eternall wee|ping

and gnashing of teeth.
The goates shall bee set on
the left hand, God will be|hold
them scornefully, and
afarre off; they shall be cal|led
cursed, and they shall be
driuen from God into euer|lasting
fire, there to accom|panie
the diuel and his An|gels,
whom in this life they
haue associated and resem|bled.


66
The hard things, are of|ten
most excellent, for our
businesse in this world is to
striue against flesh  blood,
which is not a matter of
ease. Among diuers com|bats
therewith, they haue
not the least, who are in the
stead of a father and mo|ther.
The hardnesse here|of

is, that such standing in
the place of natural parents,
should do that right to the
child in cold reason, which
the other would doe in the
heate of affection. Now
men saile with affection,
but row hard with reason,
yet the worth and reward
counteruaile the labour. It
must needs be a matter of
excellent worth: for God
is the God of the fatherles,
and hee ioyneth with God
that helpeth them; hee is
Gods instrument, and hath
a deputiship vnder God; as
for the reward, mercy pro|cureth
mercy, temporall, e|ternall.
Thou maist well
hope, that God who is plea|sed
with thy goodnesse to
the children of others, will

raise vp the goodnesse of o|thers
to helpe thy children;
and himselfe will become a
father vnto thee and thine.
But if thou liftest vp thy
hand against those, whom
God hath taken into his
protection, feare thou the
Iudgement without mer|cy,
for shewing no mercy;
and that while thou art a
very father in law to others,
God will be a father in law
to thee and thine, which
makes men of al others the
most miserable Orphans.


67
Marriage of all naturall
actions is of most conse|quence,
yet is it the worst
done of any other. For men
doe not commonly make
marriages, but bargaines,

and the bargaine being
made, the marriage comes
in vpon the bargaine. But it
was not so from the begin|ning.
In the first marriage,
the woman was the princi|pall
part proposed to the
man, and in her chiefly the
Kingdome of God, and the
righteousnesse thereof. So
it should be still, the great
matters of the Law should
be preferred before Cum|min
and Mints, yet these
need not altogether to bee
neglected: howsoeuer, that
which is absolutely and on|ly
necessarie, must bee held
whatsoeuer become of that
which is but conuenient.
Examples of holy Scripture
shew vs plentifully, the mi|serable
issues of marriages

made not in the Lord,
which might be so many in|structions
to future times.
In the first world, wicked
wiues, euen the daughters
of flesh and blood, corrup|ting
the sonnes of God,
brought in the Flood. Af|terward,
the most wise of
onely men, Solomon, by ido|latrous
wiues, was bowed
aside to the worship of I|dols,
from the seruice of the
true God, who appeared to
him twice: wherefore God
did rent his kingdom from
him, and gaue it to his ser|uant.
But a spectacle of
long miserie, and as long
wickednesse, was that vn|happy
marriage betweene
the sonne of Iehosaphat, and
the daughter of Ahab; ther|by

was Iehosaphat himselfe
drawne into danger and
losse, and into the cause of
them, worse then them|selues,
euen to the loue of
them which hated God.
Thereby the sonne of Ieho|saphat,
yea his sonnes sonne
became wicked and vnhap|pie
generations, this sen|tence
waiting on their sins;
for the one had the daugh|ter
of Ahab to wife, and the
other was counselled by his
mother to doe wickedly.
Let men therefore be afraid
to infect themselues and
their posterity, by becom|ming
one flesh with wic|kednesse;
to marry vnto a
leprosie of the soule is worse
then into that of the body.
A woman is a needle to

pierce into the heart and
affections of man, and if
she be wicked, the diuell is
the thread which followes
after. This knowes the
tempter right well, therfore
by Eue hee got within A|dam;
by Dalilah hee ouer|came
Samson; by the daugh|ters
of Moab, he got power
on the children of Israel, to
inspire into them idolatrie,
one of his chiefest poisons.
Therefore let no man for
money take vnto him a fa|ctor
for the diuell, lest
thereby the diuel attended
with the curse of God,
(which euer followes him)
enter in vpon him and his
posteritie. The remainder
of flesh in the best regene|rate,
though but a part of

him, is alreadie too great a
friend to our greatest ene|mie;
let vs not adde to this
fleshly part a whole body
of flesh to increase the
griefe and incombrance of
the Spirit of God in vs, and
to increase the force of Sa|tan,
and of his temptations
against vs. But let them
that do so, know, that they
seek the ruine of their hou|ses
by the same meanes, by
which they seeke to raise
them. For though Satan
bee a strong man able to
keepe a house in peace, yet
there is a stronger then he,
who often bindeth this
strong man, and taketh his
house from him; or if hee
leaue it to him still to bee
maintained (as indeed hee

is allowed to be a kind of a
Prince in this world) yet
miserable is that standing,
and worse then falling,
which stands by Satan; for
there comes a day wherein
his principalitie it selfe shall
fall and bee ouerthrowne,
and al that it doth sustaine.
And in the meane time,
what a bettering of an
house is this, to increase the
liuing, and to corrupt the
liuers? to grow outwardly
in wealth, and to decay in|wardly
in grace and vertue?
to lose in our selues,  our
posterity, y^t we may adde to
the estate of our selues, and
our posteritie? The true pa|terne
of marriages was the
first, made by God himselfe;
and therefore to be imita|ted

by the children of God:
therin God gaue man a hel|per
fit for him; fit she was to
help him in spiritual things,
euen the seruice of God, 
fit to help him in temporal
things, eue~ those of this life.
Such is y^e wife described by
Salomon, fit to do her husba~d
good al the daies of her life:
good to his soule, good to
his body; for she feareth the
Lord,  therfore is praised.
This paterne being follow|ed,
wee may certainely be|leeue,
that he which allow|ed,
and blessed the first, will
also allow and blesse all
those which are like it. He
will behold such a marriage
with pleasure, while it is
making; he will be present
at it, for his good will was

principally sought in it; and
he will prosper it, that men
shall haue cause to say; Lo,
thus shall the man bee bles|sed,
that feareth the Lord.
But because goodnesse in
any sexe is ouer rare; and it
may seeme a hard matter to
get one, that may fully e|quall
the patterne; first, re|member
whose gift a good
wife is, and seeke to him,
from whom commeth eue|ry
good gift. Surely it is to
be feared, that many haue
bestowed themselues ill, be|cause
they sought not to
him, who onely could haue
bestowed them well, or be|cause
they sought him
more for outward aduan|tages,
then for inward gra|ces.
Secondly, if thou hast

done this, and yet thou fin|dest
not that one among a
thousand; and need so re|quires,
that thou must pro|ceed
in thy purpose: when
thou canst not get a bur|ning
lamp, get thee a smo|king
flax, if not one that is
expert, and by long custom
exercised and vsed to strong
meate, yet one that desires
the sincere milke of the
Word to grow thereby.
Take one that is likely to
become a Temple for the
holy Ghost, and this likeli|hood
find not in thine own
presumption, but in her dis|position.
That this may be
really performed, let vs first
discerne a mind teachable,
and willing to learne. It is
a first and chiefe step to|ward

God, to hearken after
God. Therefore wisedome
euer begins her speech with
this; Heare yee children,
and incline your eares to
wisdome, and, He that hea|reth
is wise, and wil increase
in learning. Next, let her be
humble and meek; for such
a spirit is a fit receptacle for
God, it is before God a
thing much set by, and to
such, God will reueale his
secret mysteries. Now be|cause
man is weake, and his
affections rob him of his
iudgement, making him to
thinke that partie excel|lent,
to whom hee hath an
excessiue affectio~: Let God
bee instantly sought to e|stablish
weake and deceiue|able
man; let him be intrea|ted,

that he wil not be wan|ting
to that, which much
concerneth his glory and
seruice, and the good of his
seruants. And these things
thus ordered, strong hope
may be conceiued, that he
who heard Abrahams ser|uant,
when hee intreated a
wife for his Masters sonne,
will giue such a wife as shee
was to the sonnes of Abra|ham:
and he who gaue vn|to
Ruth a mighty man of
wealth, and one blessed of
the Lord, because she resol|ued,
that the God of Israel
should be her God; will also
giue the like blessing vnto
the followers of Ruth. But
while I sing the Songs of
Sion in a strange land, the
Chaldea~s or wizards of this

world vnderstand not the
language; the naturall man
perceiueth not the things
of God, neither can Scrip|ture
by any meanes make
him leaue a good bargaine.
Therefore will hee still in
spight of heauen, marry his
land to his neighbors great
portion: I meane his Son,
that would perchance bee
better then himselfe, to his
neighbors daughter, which
perchance will make him, if
she can, worse then the fa|ther.
These exchangers of
money by bargaines con|summated
in the Temple,
since the Word (which for|biddeth
the house of God
to bee made a denne of
theeues) cannot driue them
thence, it may he a whip of

cords will. And surely in e|uerie
daies experience, such
a one is laid soundly on ma|ny
of their backes. And
therein a twofold cord, that
breaketh both bones and
hearts is especially remark|able.
One is the often dis|like
betweene such vnhal|lowed,
or at least, vnequall
parties. Religion is the tru|est
and strongest bond of
loue; where that failes, na|ture
is next, which is most
corrupt. Nature delightes
in new lusts, and so runnes
after that which it hath not,
neglecting what it hath.
Hence hath that cursed
speech issued from one of
her followers: That hee
could loue his wife aboue
any other, if shee were not

his wife; making that a rea|son
of hatred, which a Chri|stian
makes chiefly a reason
of loue. And when this loa|thing
of the partie posses|sed,
hath brought forth the
desire of another, and that
desire, obtaining; what hart
is then great inough to
beare the vexing and tor|menting
thoughts that
swell therein by this forsa|king?
if it be the wiues part,
as most often it is, shee still
beholdeth with indignati|on,
the lothing of her selfe,
the losse of her right in him
for whom she forsooke all
others, and his giuing of
himself away to a stranger.
These meditations eate vp
her heart, and then she cur|seth
the time of her mar|riage,

and all them that
made it. When this newes
commeth home to the
churle her father, he doubts
at last his daughter is cast a|way;
which he might pro|bably
haue doubted before,
and much more profitably,
for then he could haue hol|pen
it. And now when she
sitteth as a Nun forsaken of
the world, breaking her
owne heart, and somewhat
her fathers; miserie beateth
into them, that instruction
could not teach them; that
marriages made without
God, are wordes, not acti|ons;
since such a woman
hath had much money be|stowed
on her to bee called
a wife, and yet shee hath no
husband. Another cord

wherewith this kind of fol|lie
whippeth it self is, when
the partie which was taken
into this match for the
greatnesse of estate, by vi|ces
wasteth the estate
which onely made the
match. This to the coue|tous
father, is the worst di|uorce;
for hee married his
daughter to the wealth, not
to the man, and that wealth
is separated from her. After
this, the man is found, ap|prehended
and condem|ned
to bee wicked, which
he was indeed before, but
his wealth gaue his wicked|nesse
such a golden luster,
that couetousnesse could,
or would not see what it
saw: but now neglected
wickednesse begetting po|uertie

makes him odious,
whom wickednesse could
not, and the robbed child is
returnable to the parents
wanting another portion
for maintenance. In this
case also, religion would
haue been a remedie, which
takes men, though not di|strustfull
and vnbeleeuing,
yet prouident for their fa|milie.
These be the stripes
of gracelesse marriages,
which afflict both the mar|ried
parties and their pa|rents,
and would, if obser|ued,
teach wisedome good
cheape to others, as they
dearely and deepely haue
imprinted it into these. But
this is the pitty, that mony
is so pleasant and glorious
a thing, that it casteth Sun|beames

on euery person
that hath it, be he neuer so
base; and the yong womans
father hath his thoughts so
cheared therewith, that he
must needs hope the best
of his sonne in law, though
nothing but money giue
him such aduice; wherefore
it is yet to bee feared, that
many gazing  gaping on
wealth, wil follow it so close,
that they shall stumble in|to
the same ditches, where|in
they haue seene many of
their neighbors wallowing.
This makes sport for the
diuel, and thus is man most
truly fayry-led, euen led a|side
by the spirits of dark|nesse
into the wandring
waies of Balaam the sonne
of Beor, who made Israel to

sinne. But this makes bit|ter
lamentation, euen the
mourning for sonnes and
daughters in the Church of
God; for hereby hath the
Church lost many, both
sonnes and daughters, some
being turned from a good
profession, others being al|together
bred in Paga|nisme,
hauing no difference
from heathen, but onely in
the saying of a Pater noster,
a Creede, and it may bee,
the ten Commandements.
Therfore the Church takes
vp her complaint, and in
sorrow of heart cries out:
The Nation is increased,
but her ioy is diminished,
there are children borne
but not to her; therefore
as Rachel she praieth, Giue

me children or else I die, or
else with Rahel she weepeth
and will not bee comfor|ted,
because her children
are not.


68
If a man thinkes he hath
some vnderstanding hee
must thus imploy it, else he
hath not what he thinkes
he hath. First he must vn|derstand
and know the
great ignorance which is in
man, and particularly of
things Diuine, aboue vs;
yea of naturall things be|fore
vs; God and the happi|nesse
in him is farre from
our Reach, and euen in na|turall
and created things
wee are suddainly stinted,
our knowledge quickly
stopping and resting in a

confession of hidden and
secret faculties. Therefore
ignora~ce co~fessed is a great
wisedome in vs. Secondly
he must know  acknow|ledge
the great and general
misery of mankinde, which
through sicknesse, oppressi|on,
misery,  folly reignes
in the world; and he must
know into what kinde of
world, hee is borne and
brought, that so he may
learne on what conditions
he doth liue. Thirdly he
must see the impotence
and weakenesse of man, to
lift himselfe aboue himself,
and to adde one cubite yea
one finger to the height of
his Being.: so that of him|selfe
he can get very little
aboue the ignorance, or the

misery vnder which his
condition is to liue. But
this knowledge is not that
we should sit downe there|in
without vse; for then it
were but a Lamp vnto mi|sery.
But that iustly valuing
our selues, we should bee
both humble and patient,
as low and miserable crea|tures;
but withall should lift
our eyes (since our selues
we cannot) aboue this mi|sery
vnto him, who is true
wisdome, Almighty power,
and perfect happines: pray|ing
him by an addition of
a new creation to the old,
to raise vs aboue our selues
increasing our knowledge,
strengthning vs, to ascend
vnto him, who is very Feli|citie;
protecting and com|forting

vs in this path of
misery which leadeth vnto
him. And now hauing
God, by the Spirit of his
Sonne, from thenceforth
in him we are wise, strong
and happie, who to vs is
wisedome, protection, hap|pinesse,
yea al things; and so
we which before could not,
may now reioyce; but in
the Lord.


69
To perceiue and finde
the truth of Christ, we must
not looke into our selues,
but into Christ and the
doctrine wherein he is deli|uered,
and which he deliue|reth.
For if we looke into
our selues, we can see no|thing
in our selues, that
may prooue the gift of

Christ vnto vs. We may ve|rily
see, that we neede those
effects, which by Christ are
performed, euen redempti|on,
and regeneration; but
that the Sonne of God
should take vpon him the
nature of ma~ to effect this,
in our selues wee cannot
finde. For first, man was
created without any neede,
or helpe of this incarnati|on;
and therefore there was
no instinct of such a myste|ry
planted in him at his
creation, as there was of the
Deity. Againe, man being
falne, he could not see any
perfect way out of his mi|serie,
as appeareth at this
day among the Heathen
that know not Christ.
Thirdly, were man neuer so

intelligent, yet being but a
creature, which cannot
comprehend his Creator,
how could man compre|hend
this mystery, which
was a secret purpose flow|ing
out of the vnsearchable
will of God, whose Spirit
none knowes but his owne
spirit? so that what issueth
therefrom, is such as the
eye hath not seene, the eare
hath not heard, nor the
heart of man conceiued;
and among these principall
is this mysterie of our salua|tion
by Christ. Wherefore
going out of our selues, and
not seeking Christ in our
owne wisedome, which
comprehendeth him not,
let vs goe to him and to his
doctrine; and therein wee

shall finde admirable wise|dome,
excellent iustice,
deepe mercy, infinite pow|er,
perfect holinesse, and in
summe a mysterie becom|ming
God as the Author of
it, and fitting aboue all o|ther
the miserie of decaied
and wretched man. If we
looke into this mystery, we
shall see him restoring man,
by whom man was made,
and who better then he?
we shall see man die for the
sinne of man,  how could
Gods iustice bee otherwise
satisfied, there hauing been
a vow that man should die
when he did eate? We shall
see the Spirit of puritie
which first made man to
Gods image, renewing and
sanctifying him aboue the

first strength. We shall see a
Law of perfect holinesse
taught and prescribed by
Christ, fit for God to re|quire,
and for man to per|forme
to his God. And fi|nally
Christ bringeth vs to
the presence of God our
Soueraigne good, defen|ding
vs in the way from
our ouer-mightie aduersa|ries
the diuels and their ser|uants,
whom also at last he
wholly suppresseth. These
things are in the doctrine
of Christ: Things necessary
to bee done for the saluati|on
of man, but not done at
all, if not done by Christ;
for in no other wee finde
them performed. And if we
looke into some circum|stances
of this doctrine, we

shall finde that Christ was
prophecied of inparadise by
God: in Egypt by Iacob, in
Iudea by the Prophets, the
Iewes the enemies of Christ
confirming it. Besides, the
story of the fall we finde fit|ly
to agree with our present
condition, and that is deli|uered
onely in that storie
wherein also Christ, the Re|medy
of the fall is promi|sed.
Wherefore one issuing
from God, the other also
hath the authoritie of the
same reporter. And though
Christ haue no need of the
diuels acknowledgement,
yet their testimony may
serue against themselues;
and it was from below if
not from aboue, that the
Sibyl cited by Virgil foretold

of Christ: Christ being on
earth, was confessed by the
diuels; and wicked spirits
at this day trading with
witches, seek to draw them
from Christ to themselues.
Lastly, the prophecies of
Christ himselfe concerning
Ierusalem, concerning the
succession of his owne do|ctrine,
of his disciples and
beleeuers, became true in
the euent, and as it was
prophecied, to this religion
and doctrine the diuell op|posed
himselfe aboue all o|ther
by persecution; where|fore
it was aboue all other,
the chiefe doctrine that op|posed
him; in the opposi|tion,
ouerthrow, and vndo|doing
of whom and his
workes standeth a maine

part of our redemption
and saluation.


70
The diuels preaching is
cleane contrary to Gods.
God beginneth with the
Law, and endeth with the
Gospell: but the diuell be|gins
with the Gospel, and
ends in the Law. God saith,
When ye eate ye shall die
yet to man being dead gi|ueth
Christ to restore him.
The diuel saith, ye shall not
die at all; yet when man (by
his temptation being be|come
mortall) should be re|stored
by Christ, he goes a|bout
to kill that Christ
which was to be the life of
them, whom he had promi|sed
that they should not
die at all. So continually be|fore

we sinne he saith to e|uery
one of vs, God is mer|cifull,
and Christ is a recon|ciliation
for all our sinnes;
but after wee haue sinned,
he saith, whosoeuer sinneth
is not borne of God; The
soule that sinnes shall die.
And to them that sinne af|ter
grace receiued; There
remaines no more sacrifice
for sinne, but a feareful loo|king
for of iudgement. But
we must cure our selues by
contraries. Therefore let vs
still vse Gods kinde of prea|ching
to ourselues; which
is contrary to Satans. Be|fore
we sinne let vs set the
whole Law, euen the terror
of God before vs, to affright
vs from sinne, and hauing
sinned, let vs carry the yoke

of the Law vntill we be tru|ly
humbled for our sinnes:
But after due humiliation,
let vs take hold on the Gos|pell;
which to all penitent
Christians, is the true and
rightfull successour of the
Law.


71
There are two sorts that
reade bookes, to make the~|selues
better by them: One,
that gathereth from them
whatsoeuer addeth to their
knowledge or vertue. The
other would make it selfe
better also, but it is in repu|tation,
and glory; for by see|king
of faults and errours,
they desire to raise them|selues
aboue the writer. But
I must borrow leaue here
to vse the words of Christ,

I tell you the Publican re|turnes
home iustified ra|ther
then the Pharisie: The
humble learner is more
substantially increased, the~
the proud Scribe, and the
ambitious disputer. The
first gets into him an essen|tiall
growth, the other rai|seth
himselfe only vpon
stiltes. The one, acquireth
more solide matter, the o|ther
a greater swelling; the
one increaseth in the inner
man, the other in the old
Adam. Surely the latter
with Mary hath made the
better choise, there beeing
no comparison betweene
the increase of life eternall,
and the puffing vp of va|nishing
and vaine glory.
Wherefore let vs couet the

best gifts, and though wee
need not put out our eies,
not to discerne faults when
we meet them yet it is both
needlesse, foolish, and sin|full
to vse our eyes to that
purpose onely or chiefely.
But the whole and chiefe
ayme of man in all things,
beeing the kingdome of
God and the righteousnes
thereof, let him in reading
keepe that still fixed before
him, as his especiall marke,
fitting and leuelling there|unto
euery thing that will
serue to this end. If thou
meetest with errors in do|ctrine,
thou maist warne
thy selfe  others of them;
but if onely with slips of
infirmitie, couer them to
thy selfe and others, consi|dering

that thou also art a
man subiect to the same if
not greater frailty. And so
shalt thou best aduance the
benefite of that worke to
thy selfe  others. For that
which is read by an vnder|standing
sweetned and sea|soned
with humility and
charitie, discouers to such a
reader the whole beautie,
treasure and goodnesse it
hath, and bestoweth all on
him. But to the proud in|quisitor,
it hideth much of
itselfe, being vailed and co|uered
with an apparance of
euill cast vpon it by the e|uill
minde that read it. Be|sides,
when good things be
found, and among them
some faults though excusa|ble,
if the minde out of

weakenesse or censorious|nesse
dwell vpon those
faults, it is a great oddes but
vpon so kinde entertain|ment,
they will make bold
to perswade, that the good
shall doe no good, but that
which is faulty shall giue a
distast to that which is pro|fitable.
But as in the church
so of the Church, let all
things be done to Edifica|tion.


72
A setled and resolued
purpose to bee rich, is the
fountaine of infinite euils.
For this resolution once
being fixed, presently the
eyes, and the eares are tur|ned
into meere intelligen|cers
and suruaiors. They
are wholly imployed to

seeke  search whatsoeuer
lyeth fit, and whatsoeuer is
profitable; And withall the
heart greedily stands ga|ping
to deuoure whatsoe|uer
of this fit and profitable
comes within reach. The
difference of things (as law|fulnesse
 vnlawfulnesse)
is take~ away; for the stre~gth
 eagernesse of the desire
digests all alike into nou|rishment,
as a mightie Ap|petite
doth meates both
raw and rosted. It is a heart-breaking,
not to adde som|what
continually; and if
Nabothes Vineyard come
not, being called for, it is
death to looke vpon it.
What though the getting
of it cost the death of the
owner, yet the couetous

man must saue the life of
his lust; and indeede his
owne life, which he saies,
profiteth him not, except
he satisfie his lust. Hence it
is so many widdowes grone
toward heauen for the help
which they cannot haue
on earth, so many father|lesse
children are ready to
die in the streetes for want
of bread; and so many vn|dermined,
sacked, and ran|sacked
families, being dri|uen
from their own homes
wander vp and downe to
seeke a couering for their
heads from raine and tem|pest.
Iustly therefore that
holy Apostle and out of
diuine inspiratio~ pronoun|ced
this as an infallible and
neuer failing positio~: They

that will be rich, fall into
temptation and snares, and
into many foolish and noi|some
lusts which drowne
men in perdition and de|struction.
And how can it
be otherwise? The end and
marke being fixed, the eye
is still ayming,  the hands
are still working toward
that end: And this end be|ing
riches, and not God (for
a man cannot serue two
masters) thither tend the
whole endeauours of the
hungry  couetous soule.
If an vniust profit bee offe|red,
or rather vnoffered
may bee hooked; the eye
lookes on riches, and not
on God: and accordingly
God  his will being neg|lected,
riches are taken

howsoeuer displeasing vn|to
God. God must beare
with him; for hee must bee
rich. That plot must go for|ward,
the resolution is fix|ed;
God must giue place, he
doth not see it, or will per|chance
forgiue it. But
whiles thou not seeing, or
at least not regarding God,
thinkest God therefore see|eth
not thee; he sees thee
verily, and will bring forth
thy workes of darkenesse
into light euen starke na|ked,
and they shall bee thy
perdition and destruction.
But rather breake in pieces
this thy resolution, O man
of earth, whosoeuer thou
art. Fasten not thy soule to
riches which are not wor|thie
of thy soule; neither

make them thy marke and
end, which were made for
thee: know thou that God
alone is thy end, and thou
art made to serue him on|ly,
that God is thy happi|nesse,
and it is thy only feli|city
to enioy him: that God
is thy chiefest treasure, ther|fore
fixe thy heart resolued|ly
on him, remoouing it
from riches. Change thy
couetous, and be strongly
couetous after God, and
by godlines, euen faith and
a good co~science draw him
more and more into thee:
and so godlinesse shall be to
thee the greatest gaine, for
it shal get thee the best trea|sure.
As for riches, make no
couenant with them, fasten
not thy heart on them, lest

withall thou fasten thy hart
to many noisome lusts, to
many cares, and finally, to
perdition it selfe. The holy
and most quiet way is to
put contentednesse in the
place of couetousnesse, and
then godlines will appeare
that which it is, euen the
greatest gaine. This thou
shalt the better doe, if thou
consider the ende of thy
creation, that man was cre|ated
not to be rich, neither
is that the busines appoin|ted
him by his Creator: But
the Creator himselfe is the
end of man; neither hath
the Creator made any ne|cessitie,
that a man should
be rich: for foode and rai|ment,
and satisfaction of
naturall necessities, is his

chiefest drift and purpose
of worldly things. There|fore
in the last iudgement
when it shall be demanded
of thee, how thou hast
spent thy time in the world,
and what thou hast done
there; shalt thou not bee a|shamed
then to say, I haue
there done all that I could
doe to bee rich? For then
shall that plainly appeare,
which now is true, though
not appearing: The man
hath mistaken his busines,
that onely studieth riches;
for then it shall bee said to
the couetous, That man
was not made to bee a ga|therer
of mettall, nor a filler
of bags, nor a ioyner of
hedge to hedge; much lesse
to be a prowling vermine, a

rauening wolfe, or a roa|ring
Lyon to deuoure
the weake, the distressed
and the helpelesse. The im|ployment
of our naturall a|bilities,
as vnderstanding,
or strength, in lawfull acti|ons
to procure mainte|nance
for our selues and our
families, shal then be allow|ed.
For this maintenance
is the supportation of Gods
Church in this vale of ne|cessities,
and so tendeth to
God. But a desire of riches
for themselues, or for the
outward glory of them,
and that setled purpose to
be rich, shall be condemned
in the great and terrible day
of the Lord; and then chie|fest
in condemnation, and
of any of their ranke next

the diuell in torment shall
they bee, that haue made a
prey of miserie; and where|as
miserie is to goodnesse a
ground of mercy and re|liefe,
these haue made it a
ground of oppression, so
adding sorrow to afflicti|on,
making miserie be|cause
it was somewhat
wretched, perfectly misera|ble.
To these shall also the
perfection of miserie be ap|pointed
for a portion, euen
pure and cleare iudgement,
without the mixture of any
mercy; and so their owne
measure for qualitie being
returned to them, (but in a
farre greater quantitie) they
shall then taste how bitter
the cup is, which they haue
giuen others to drinke; and

they shall by experience,
but helpelesse and remedi|lesse,
know the grieuousnes
of their owne workes. And
because this day is by such
put farre from them, and
they comfort themselues in
the delay of it, let them
know also, that some sinnes
are partly iudged afore|hand,
euen in this world:
And among them, very
commonly, the sinne of op|pression.
For often is it
seene, that the fathers op|pression,
hath been powred
out on his owne sonne; and
riches gotten wrongfully
for posteritie, haue beene
wrongfully taken from
them, for whom they were
wrongfully gotten. Wher|fore
eue~ for feare of present

iudgement, and in meere
good husbandrie, leaue not
the goods of wrong and
robberie to your children.
For vengeance and they
are inseparably tied toge|ther;
they will hardly bee
quiet till they bee gone a|gaine,
and the beame will
crie to therafter, the hedge
to the field, This is not our
place, let vs euery one re|turne
to our owne home.


73
Consisting of 8. parts.

Part. 1.
The Church of God, and
the Church of Satan, accor|ding
to the first law of en|mitie
enacted in Paradise,
and followed with the con|tinuall
practise of succee|ding
times, haue endlesse

warres and combats. The
weapons of the whole
Church are stedfast and the
same, as the Word, Faith,
Prayer, Patience, Christian
wisedome, and the like. But
the weapons of Satan are
diuers, as of a cunning en|giner,
that still inuenteth
new instruments, accor|ding
to present occasi|ons.
Among diuers other
changes, hee changeth his
persecutions, a principall
part of his battering ordi|nance.
When God lets him
loose, then hee sheweth the
whole malice of his nature,
hee appeares in the very
shape of a Lyon, and tea|reth,
frieth, burneth men,
made vp in the likenesse of
torches. But when God

muzles and binds him, that
hee cannot bite, nor teare
with his teeth, and his
clawes, then he putting off
the Lyon, vseth the craft
and tongue of the Serpent;
euen malicious cunning, to
fret into the Church of
God, and vndermine it by
little and little. According|ly
at this time of outward
peace, he sets his malignant
souldiers among vs newly
on work, especially in three
things, which though they
are become somewhat fa|shionable,
yet be they very
mischieuous to the Church
of God. A first is to put
co~tempt on the Ministery,
which are Gods Colony on
earth to keepe his subiects
in obedience, and to beate

off the enemies; the Salt
that keepes men sauourie
and vntainted of Satan; the
shepheards which keep the
sheep from the wolfe: Sure|ly
if these may be contem|ned,
discouraged, or taken
away, how must not the
Church of God become a
prey? How neere is Satan
then to a full principalitie
on earth? Yet these are di|uersly
afflicted, debased and
troden downe. I passe by
their owne mutual harmes,
which as griefe wishes
might neuer haue bin, that
they might neuer haue bin
spoken of; so now it desires
to couer with silence. But
the lay seruants of Satan de|spight
them diuers waies.
And first they let flie at the

very calling it selfe, by tur|ning
the Ministerie into an
ignominy and reproch. If a
man be a Minister, he hath
deserued at the next quar|rell
pickt at him, to be cald
pild Priest. And when this
is done, it is to be thought
hee hath beene cald worse
then rescall, euen as Paul
saith, the very scumme of
the earth. But where liue
we the whilest and among
what people? It is thought
among Christians. But
are they Christians that
thus tread downe those
messengers of Christ, which
outwardly by Baptisme
make them such Christi|ans,
as they are, and inward|ly
by the word, make bet|ter
Christians then they are

yet? Are they Christians
that being begotten by spi|rituall
fathers, will raile on
their fathers that begat
them? surely it shewes they
were neuer truly begotten.
A Christian honoureth
Christ, by whom hee bea|reth
y^e name of Christia~. He
honoreth him so, that who|soeuer
bringeth Christ to
him, and him to Christ, hee
honoureth them also. Christ
himselfe was a Preacher,
and the founder of the Mi|nisterie:
if thou then de|spisest
the Ministerie, thou
despisest the very function
of Christ, and the instituti|on
of Christ; yea, thou de|spisest
Christ himselfe, and
then without question thou
despisest thy owne saluati|on.

Take heed therfore thou
run not against this sacred
Priesthood of the Gospell,
for it is rocky; and whosoe|uer
runneth against it, brea|keth
himselfe in pieces. It is
rockie, for Christ the rocke
is the foundation of it; and
what is built on it, is rocky,
as Peter from Petra. But
some will say, They despise
not the Ministers for their
office, but their liues; and
consequently not the good
but the bad. Surely as this
on the one side, preferres a
petition to the reuerend
Fathers, to admit, or conti|nue
none of scandalous
life, so otherwise it giues vs
this answere; that these are
y^e more mannerly kind of
men that so say; for there is

a number, which if they see
but a man in black, in their
brauery come off presently,
There goes a Priest; where|of
the meaning is, There
goes a man of contempt,
per excellentiam. But if thou
which excusest, despisest
onely the men, why castest
thou a reflex of thy malice
on the calling, by reuiling
him with the name of a
Priest, as with a reproch?
VVhat is the chaffe to the
wheate? Is he euill? He can
neuer defile that excellent
calling, though hee may
scandall it; the euill is from
himself, not from his Mini|sterie:
yea, the Ministerie is
good, though tied to an ill
person; therefore is not the
Ministerie of a good man

any way within reproach
for the faults of a bad one.
Let his person beare his
faults, and not the Ministe|ry
which is not the cause of
them; Let him beare it him
selfe, and not other righte|ous
men with him, which
hate his conditions honest|ly,
as much as thou dost
him maliciously.


2. Part.
Another notable signe
of the contempt of the
Ministery is, that gentleme~
scorne to bestow their sons
in that calling. If a man
haue a means, he is too good
for God, and he is counted
mad or base if he will turne
Minister. But know, thou
puffe of flesh and bloud
whosoeuer thou art, that

the seruice of God is the
end of man, and there is no
man good inough to de|serue
imployment in his
seruice much lesse to sur|mount
it. Thy meanes are
giuen thee for helpes, and
aduancements in his ser|uice,
not for discourage|ments;
and he that made
both them and thee, lookes
for glory to himself of both
and that with al thy might,
not ease and idlenesse only
to thy selfe. If thou haue
gifts for such a seruice, and
imployest them not there|in,
thou that wouldest
not serue his mercy, shalt
serue his iustice, and the tree
that would not beare fruit
in his field, shall beare the
fire in the place of torment.

Why cumbreth it the
ground? Hew it downe and
cast it into the lake that
burneth for euer. It is a due,
and necessarie course for
parents concerning their
sonnes, and sonnes when
they come to iudgement
concerning themselues, to
waigh and consider where|in
and in what way such
sonnes are most fit and able
to serue and glorifie their
Maker. In that way let the~
be placed, for it is a way of
safetie, protection  bles|sednesse.
Any way besides
that, is a way of dragons, it
is the broadway, and lea|deth
to destruction. If this
were obserued, God should
haue the due vse of his own
creatures. Many Alehouses,

play-houses, yea many Gib|bets
would be emptie that
now are filled; mechanicall
soules should not so oft be|come
Ministers, and excel|lent
 able soules wold not
so oft turne Lawyers, mer|chants,
yea earth wormes,
and Priests of Mammo~. Yet
blessed be God, y^t hath not
giue~ al times  places ouer
to this high Treason  In|fidelity;
for eue~ nobles who
now too much behold this
profession a far of, haue en|nobled
the~selues by seruing
a greater King the~ any they
here serue; yea crouch and
creepe to serue Gentlemen
of great possessions, where|of
yet France is not with|out
example, haue honou|red
God with their sub|stance,

 imployed it in the
Ambassage of the most
High. And no maruaile, for
if we plainly knew  saw,
what a glorious King our
god is; what a pretious thing
a soule is, what the truth, not
the name of Christia~ were,
we should account it a high
dignitie, to be imployed by
God in his busines; a great
gaine to turne one soule to
righteousnes;  a right rea|dy,
 natural duty of a true
Christia~ to resigne himselfe
ouer wholly to Christ to be
bestowed by him in any
function, since he is his, by
couena~t, rede~ptio~  marke,
 not his own any longer.
Be it therefore a law for e|uer
to the vpright of heart,
that a good Minister is an

honourable man, being an
Ambassadour of Christ, a
successor of Christ, a factor
for the King of heauen, to
returne soules the most
pretious Iewels into his
kingdome of glory; and
howsoeuer, they are here
couered with co~temt, they
shall breake out in the daies
of glory shining like the
Sunne, as hauing turned
many soules to righteous|nesse.
But that honour may
continue safe to the Mini|sterie,
God perswade them
to bestow that labour in the
word and doctrine, which
deserueth double honour;
to liue as those that adorne
the Gospell of Christ; and
themselues to bee humble,
rather receiuing honour,

then snatching at it. For
honour is best deserued,
when it is least intended;
to seeke our owne glory is
no glory; and to honour
our selues, is no true ho|nour.


3. Part.
Another new engine of
Satan is the impouerishing
of the Ministery. The diuell
knowes that the Minister
hath a bodie, which must
bee maintained by bodily
sustenance, and where this
sustenance is not, there can|not
the Minister continue.
Heretofore when diuinitie
was inspired, not studied:
an Apostle though his spi|rituall
worke were worthie
of his wages, might bestow
his worke without any wa|ges,

and get wages by the
work of his hands; But now
the study of diuinitie chal|lengeth
the whole time of
a man, so that a Diuine can
hardly mingle any other
calling with it, without in|iury
vnto it. Therefore ha|uing
that only function, by
that  for that he must be
sufficiently sustained; so is
there absolutely no hope of
a co~tinual Ministery, where
there is not a continued
maintenance. Then how
many waies haue these last
times holpen the diuell to
breake off and discontinue
the Ministerie? It is too wel
known that the bellies of y^e
friers 1. began to rob both
the back  the belly of the
Ministery. And that when
these theeues were arraig|ned

 conuicted, the goods
were not restored to the for|mer
owners thogh known;
so hereby many miles toge|ther
haue bin turned into a
spiritual wildernes, spoiled
of the ordinary means of sa|uing
soules; lamentable and
euen a hart-breaking consi|deration
it is, to them that
haue any fellow-feeling of
the misery of those, who lie
in the bondage of Satan,
when they see many Chur|ches,
like lampes without
lights, the oyle of mainte|nance
being taken fro~ the~.
How ca~ a ma~ there preach,
where there is scarse bread
to maintaine the strength
of the voice? nor clothes to
keep off the cold that would
choke y^t voice? nor means to

buy a very few bookes, to
put matter and soule into
the voices. And on the o|ther
side, how can the Eu|nuch
vnderstand, except
there be some to expound?
How can they beleeue
without preaching? alas, the
liues of such places too
much testifie, that a natu|rall
man is like a dog, and
will hardly bite at a whole
loafe; Yea that a man is so
tastelesse of spiritual things,
that except he be taught to
open his mouth, except
his stomach be stirred vp
by continuall prouocati|ons,
he hath no appetite to
the foode of life; That a
sinner is so heauily asleepe
in his sinnes, that vnlesse
he be pulled and startled,

and his sinne taken vp be|fore
him, and the particular
odiousnesse and vglinesse
thereof liuely presented to
his dull and vnwilling eies,
hee had rather die in his
sleepe, then awake vnto life
eternall.


Part 4.
But this disease being
shewed, what remedie is
there for it? Surely the Lord
of the haruest being first in|treated
in heauen, there
seeme two remedies on
earth; one is Law, another,
Conscience. But how shall
there be any hope in Law,
since it is Law that hath
done the hurt? Surely as a
Law begotten in the times
of ignorance hath hurt the
Church, so a Law borne in

the times of knowledge
may heale it. Let vs shew
our faith by our works, and
shame the workes which
haue beene done without
faith by exceeding them; if
wee haue the light of the
Gospell, let vs make statutes
of light, and not continue
the lawes of darkenesse. If
wee feele any comfort of
light in our selues, let vs
with our blessed Sauiour
pittie them that sit in dark|nesse,
and in the shaddow
of death. I separate law
fro~ conscience; for though
conscience bee the truest
fountaine of lawes, yet po|liticke
consideration is very
often the cause of them.
Now it is not the worst po|licie,
but indeed the best, to

lay a sure foundation of re|ligion
in the hearts of the
people. For from true reli|gion,
groweth the strongest
branch of obedience: true
religion hath wherewithall
to confute treason, though
masked in a vizard of religi|on.
It will allow the Pope
few subiects in another
mans Realme: It will keepe
them for the right owner.
In summe, the end of king|domes,
being the Church,
and the end of the Church,
the glorie of God by faith
and holinesse; how doth
that kingdom pierce it selfe
through with many darts,
that suffereth this faith and
holinesse, the life and soule
thereof, to bee slaine by
wickednesse and vnbeliefe?

Surely there is a fulnesse of
sinnes, which is the greatest
rebellion in the world, for
it ouerthrowes kingdomes,
and lets out Vineyards to
new husbandmen. This do
Ieroboam and Ahab now de|clare
and bewaile; Ieroboam
cursing the basenesse of his
new deuised Priesthood,
and Ahab defying the Sta|tutes
of men, it being a po|licie
to destruction, to bee
politicke against God. But
if it be demanded whence
such maintenance shold be
raised? Surely for worldly
and temporall ends, the rai|sing
of huge summes by
Parliament, are well impo|posed,
and contentedly re|ceiued;
 is there no way
to raise one summe for the

God of heauen? When
Moses prouided for the Ta|bernacle,
there was offering
euen to abundance. When
Dauid prouided for the
Temple, there were many
thousand Talents offered
willingly, and with a per|fect
heart. VVhy should
not we much more willing|ly
contribute toward the
building, not of Temples
made of hands, but of the
liuing Temple and Church
of the euerliuing God? If a
towne bee destroyed with
fire, all men take pitty on
the ruine thereof, and from
that pittie issureth reliefe.
When whole Townes and
Parishes are besieged with
hell fire, how do we not pit|ty
 succour such spirituall

desolations? Then let that
place which made the law
of substraction, redeeme it
by making a law of retribu|tion,
and by some diuine
subsidie granted to the
King of heauen, regaine
part, or all of the ancient in|heritance
of the Church, or
procure some new susten|tation
in the stead thereof.
But if mens hearts shall
herein be generally harde|ned
against God, against the
soules of their brethren,
yea, against their owne sal|uation,
and denie this iust
and necessarie helpe: Let
those that are merciful, and
therfore shal obtain mercy,
expresse this excellent ver|tue
of him that dwelleth in
them; let them binde vp

the wou~ds which the Leuits
passed by, let them imitate
him, who beheld euen them
in their blood  pollution,
and said vnto them, Liue.
Let co~science remedy what
law doth not, the worke of
God being done without,
by the working of God a|lone
in mens harts within.
Accordingly should it bee
a sweet smelling Sacrifice,
acceptablie ascending be|fore
the presence of God;
if those who are both
spirituallie and temporally
rich, should out of their
spirituall treasurie, send
foorth that most pre|tious
charitie, which might
conuert some of their
temporall and transitorie
treasure to this soule-sauing

end. Herunto God through
mee doth beseech them, as
inwardly no doubt he mo|tions
the same vnto them
by his spirit. Obedience to
God and his spirit is the
most excellent offring, and
a soule turned to God, is the
ioy of heauen; but propor|tionably
quenching the
spirit by disobedience, is a
heauie sinne; and too quiet
suffering of the death of
soules, where means would
giue hope of life, is the gall
of bitternesse, and the stone
of the heart. Our Aunce|stors
did set vp both Chur|ches,
and Churchliuings, a
great and a large work was
performed by them; we are
but to keep in reparatio~, that
they haue built. Indeed this

ouer boystrous tempest hath
ouerthrowne a great piece
of this building, yet but a
piece, not by many degrees
so great, as that work which
they raised. If they haue
done all, it is a shame wee
should not doe something;
wee should rather bee glad
(though not of the cause,
yet of this effect) that there
is matter left for our chari|tie
to expresse it selfe in this
kind; and to let blind de|uotion
know, that, if our an|cestors
had not founded
such spiritual maintenance,
it might and should yet
haue bin done by vs. There
are many godly  deuout
persons, who haue in these
daies of light, made and in|crease
dwellings  portions

for the bodies of the poore
and needy. Excellent in|deed
is this worke, it is a
blessed thing to giue, and
blessed are they that feede
the hungrie, and clothe the
naked. But yet of all Almes
houses, the spiritual Almes-house
is the best, and Paul
that willeth you to desire
the best gifts, would haue
you vse your gifts to the
best aduantage. Wherefore
I shew you a more excel|lent
way. As the soule is
infinitely better then the
bodie, and life eternall, then
life present, so the food of
the soule is farre better then
that of the body, and the
sauing of the spirituall life
better then the preseruati|on
of the temporall life. If

thou giuest to the body,
thou dost well, but thou gi|uest
to that which shall die:
but if thou giue to the
soule, thou dost better, for
thou giuest to that, which
by thy gift may liue for e|uer
in happines, and make
the body liue for euer in the
same blisse with it. If thou
giue naturall bread, thou
dost well; but thou giuest
that which perisheth with
the vsing: but thou most
resemblest Christ thy head,
and giuest the best Almes,
when thou giuest the bread
of heauen. What a com|fortable
and ioyfull thing
to thy soule and heart
will it be to see a whole
Congregation fed on Gods
holy day with thy Almes?

to see many soules recei|uing
saluation as it were
from thy hand, to heare
many blesse  glorifie God
for his gifts to thee,  thine
to them? yea to blesse thee
therefore in the name of
the Lord? Surely such ioy is
infinitely better, sounder,
and fuller of waight, then
the ioy of mony, corne, and
oyle; but the ioy that God
shall giue thee in the great
marriage day, in the day of
the gladnes of thy heart, in
that day will againe infi|nitely
exceed this. The~ shal
Christ say vnto thee, come
thou blessed of my Father;
for when I was hungry, na|ked
and cold in the very
soule of my little ones,
thou diddest buy Manna,

long white robes  fire of
the Altar, to feede, cloth 
warme me; thou gauest the
best gifts, and which most
nearely and inwardly che|rish
me, therefore shalt thou
haue the best reward; come
and sit nearest vnto me. But
if some backeward  with|drawing
hearts in whome
God hath no delight, put
this grace and glory from
themselues, by a perswasi|on,
that this businesse con|cernes
them not, but that
euery horse should beare
his owne burthen, and each
congregation maintaine a
Preacher for themselues:
Let them know, that natu|rall
men not vsed to instru|ction,
for want of it, haue
no desire to it: Things not

known are vnsought, much
lesse will a naturall man
part from things knowne
for things vnknowne. It is
the propertie of teaching
to make men desire to be
taught: expect not then this
desire from them, which
haue not the meanes to at|taine
it; the sweetnesse of
the word must be first soun|ded
in their eares, before
they will loue the sound
thereof: it must teach them
the worth of it selfe, before
they will part from any of
their worth for it. He must
be partly or wholly a spiri|tuall
man, that hungers for
spirituall foode vnto the
losse of his temporall sub|stance:
and how shall many
such be expected where the

word, by which the spirit
entereth, hath not bin fitly
opened vnto them? There|fore
if thou wilt haue them
doe for themselues, do thou
something first, though but
a little for them whereby
they may heare the word:
And then it is likely the
word heard will make way
for it selfe, and perswade for
increase of maintenance;
for it perswades the truly
sanctified to a farre greater
degree, euen to fell all, to
giue life  all, for the Trea|sure
of happinesse Christ
Iesus; whome lying more
closely in the Cabinet of
the word, preaching deli|uers
vnto vs opened and
displaied in full glorie and
Lustre. Yea it may bee by

the word so communicated
by thee, there wil be some
prouoked, to doe that for
others which thou hast
done for them; and so a ge|neration
of goodnesse may
bee continued of which
thou hast beene the father;
and a chaine of good works
may be lengthned, of which
the first linke framed by
thee, is both the beginning
and cause. Hereunto may
be added this other reason
of forrein helpe; That such
places beare already as
great a burden without the
benefite of preaching as o|thers
do that haue it. Wher|fore
that Saint Pauls rule of
equity may bee obserued,
which will not haue some
eased, to haue others dou|bly

grieued; and that rule
of Charity, Beare yee one
anothers burden: it is fit
that the burthen of such
places should be deuided a|mong
many, so to take a|way
the griefe of surchar|ging
by an equalitie, and to
ease the weight of the bur|then
by deuiding it with o|thers.


5. Part.
As these great blowes of
Satan haue afflicted the Mi|nistery
in these latter times,
so doe daily buffets,  les|ser
pinchings of the ser|uants
of Satan, follow and
persecute continually the
same Ministerie. His plot
and his hatred still are one,
though the limitation of
his power, by Gods ouer|ruling,

suffer him not at all
times to bring forth like
effects: He is, God be prai|sed,
tied vp somewhat from
appropriating of spirituall
liuings, yet what he cannot
get in a rent, hee striues to
obtaine in a fine. The Pa|tron
that cannot haue the
yearely profit, must haue a
grosse summe in conside|ration
of it, and a scholler
hauing spent much of his
portion, spirits, and time in
studie to make himselfe
worthie of a place in the
Church, yet after must he
studie for sureties, or rea|die
mony to throw into
the mouth of Cerberus, e|uen
of these porters of
hell, that they stoppe not
his way into the deserued

Benefice. And this also is
a vertue, if they will be|stow
it, in this kinde of
bestowing on a man able
and sufficient; for if such a
one bee not very neere as
finable, as a meere dumbe
and vnlearned fellow: suf|ficiency
shall bee bought
out,  profitable ignorance
shall be preferred before e|difying
knowledge. The
great God Mammon must
chuse the Priest that fitteth
him best,  the greatest 
truest God whose Priest is
thoght the~ to be choosing,
hath least to do in y^t choise.
But  thou Marchant of hel
 Factor for Sata~, know y^t
cursed is thy mony with
thee, thy mony is the price
of Soules euen of spirituall

blood, the life of spirits.
Thou hast for that summe
giuen ouer so many soules
to Satan, thou hast giuen
their throats to the But|cher,
and thou hast done
worse then slaine them; for
thou killest them with
death eternall. Christ hath
said, what shall a man giue
for his soule, yea to giue a
whole world and to lose
his soule is a bad bargaine:
but what a beggerly and
bloudy bargaine hast thou
made which for litle pieces
and shrids of the world hast
sold many soules? But to
what end is it to speake to
a man of clay, that hath no
sense nor feeling of hea|uen?
To what end is it to
speake to a mule that hath

no vnderstanding? Such
men are more dead, then
the Altar which heard the
word of the Lord. They
are stonie at the very heart,
and nothing but mony
makes any sound by stri|king
such a heart. Other|wise
euen to common rea|son
it wold grosly appeare,
that a lanterne without a
candle can giue no light,
that a man without sight
cannot bee a guide to the
blinde;  that men led by
such guides, must needes
fall with their guides into
the pit of eternall destru|ction.
But if it happen that
a man of some sufficiencie
hath like the Centurion by
a great summe obtained
the freedome of this Bene|fice:

then is the Patron
readie to go into the Tem|ple
with the Pharisie, to
giue thankes that hee is
not like other men: There
is a fit man in the place,
and hee hath taken no
mony for the Benefice
but for the Aduowson,
which a man may honestly
doe. But know thou Cir|cumuenter
of thy owne
soule: That if it were law|full
to sell an Aduowson,
thou shouldest sell it at the
price of an Aduowson.
To finde out this, consider
what either thou payest for
the patronage, and so make
some proportion by that,
or what a lay-man would
giue for it, that would make
no vse of it, but the bestow|ing.

For whatsoeuer is giuen
beyond that which a man
would giue to haue the
meere naming of the Mi|nister,
is the price of the be|nefice,
and not of the Ad|uowson;
it paies for the
profit of the liuing,  not
for the particular appoint|ment
of the man. Mingle
things as cunningly, and
confusedly as thou canst,
the iudgement of God shal
single the~ as perfectly, and
the euill shal be take~ out 
shewed thee by it self in the
great  terrible day of the
Lords displeasure. Yet nei|ther
do I co~mend y^e selling
of Aduousons though at
the easier rate; for a Patro|nage
is an excellent priui|ledge,
a patrone hath the

power of a great and high
worke, euen in the chiefest
businesse of God. Why wilt
thou for a little mony let
another doe God accepta|ble
seruice, when thou maist
do it thy selfe? Or why per|chance
dost thou suffer an|other
to doe Gods seruice
negligently and corruptly,
when thou maist doe it
faithfully? Take heede here|unto;
for if by thy sale, the
sheepe be vnfed, for whome
Christ died, thou maist go
among the cursed to whom
it shall be said, When I was
an hungrie thou hadst food
in thy hand, and yet thou
fedst me not.


Part. 6.
But after all this, is not
the Minister fully escaped;

hauing paide the Patron
for his passage, he falles af|ter
into the hands of his
Parish: then is hee like a
man rid of a Lyon,  falne
among Wolues; euery one
(almost, if not wholly) rubs
vp his wit, and makes it a
principall conquest, to de|ceiue
the Parson. Howsoe|uer
the Vsurer haue his ten
of the hundred, the Lawyer
his grossefee, and the work|man
his wages; the Mini|ster,
who layes out his stock
for their saluation, shall not
haue his tenne of the hun|dred,
nay, but a leane fee for
the most pretious counsell;
nor his full wages for his
most excellent worke. It is
a speciall part of thrift, if we
cannot conceale and de|fraud

some tithes, yet to
make a good bargaine with
the Minister, and to get
somewhat by him; and if
he will not bee so wrought
on, he must goe for a coue|tous
and hard man. But O
thou ouerthriftie Tither,
what thinkest thou, while
thou dealest thus? hast thou
a soule or not? If thou hast
none, at least, if thou thin|kest
so, words wil be vseles,
vntill thou feele one day
by the torments of thy
soule that thou hast one;
and then they will also bee
vselesse. But if thou hast
one, it is better then thy bo|dy,
which is also better then
thy goods. Thou gladly gi|uest
to the Phisition to
maintaine the health of

thy body, and to the Law|yers
to preserue thy goods:
how doth not thy hand
willingly  chiefly stretch
foorth it selfe to him which
saueth thy soule, which is
infinitely better then these?
It sheweth too euidently,
that thou valuest things
backwards, since thou e|steemest
not thy soule, as
thou dost thy goods and
body, nor the eternall salua|tion
thereof as thy present
preseruation. But they that
haue had a glimse of hea|uenly
glorie, despise earth|ly
things in comparison
thereof, and in disdaine
say, Is it a great matter to
giue carnall things for spiri|tuall?
such men know, they
cannot giue so good things

to them, as they receiue
from them. Therefore they
would euen take out of
their owne bowels to doe
good to their teachers, at
least they wold thrust their
right vpon them, though
ignorant of it; they would
by all meanes desire, that
they might liue plentifully
in this world, whose life is
imploied to make them
liue euerlastingly in the
next. Farre be it then from
vs to vexe and discourage
by robberie and impoue|rishing
those, who are the
guides vnto heauen. Let di|uine
loue iustifie them in
taking their right, yea, help
them to it, and bring after
them, what they haue left
of it. Let vs entertaine them

as embassadours of Christ
with bountifull allowance,
and not shew our small re|gard
of the Lord that sent
them, by our ill rewarding
of his messengers. Their e|state
is but for life, and na|turall
affection towards
their family, is commenda|ble
in them as in vs; there|fore
a prouident care, if
without wrong, is not to
be censured, but allowed in
them; and a willing and a
plentifull contribution is
requisite in vs. And herein
I deserue speedier assent,
because I am none of those
I speake for.


Part. 7.
A third cunning of Sa|tan
is to make sanctificati|on
an odious thing, and to

fasten on it some vile re|proch,
that men may bee a|shamed
to serue God, and
to be saued. And that this
may worke the more effe|ctually,
he suffers many to
goe so farre in religion as
they may, without losing
them, that is, in a morall
and ciuill profession there|of;
but that degree, beyond
which indeed is onely the
very life and power of san|ctification,
is very offensiue
to them, and appeares to
such to bee but hypocrisie
and scrupulositie. Hence it
is, that among most of these
ciuilians, regeneration and
sanctification, which they
attaine not, is Puritanisme,
and a true Saint is called a
Puritan; which in their

English, meanes a dissem|bling
or scrupulous fellow.
And this being the verdit
of those, who account the~|selues
for honest men, and
their neighbours think the
same (to whom these ciuill
men are almost Puritans)
like a kennel of dogs, they
runne away with the crie,
and barke out this terme a|gainst
euery honest man
they meete. But a lamenta|ble
persecution of tongues
is this the whiles, especially
among Christians, that a
man should be reuiled for
being a Christian; and that
regeneration, the worke of
the holy Ghost, should bee
reproched. Cursed is hee
that despiteth the Spirit of
grace, eue~ that Spirit which

gaue his tongue that pow|er,
by which hee is able to
speake against the Spirit.
Cursed is hee that reuileth
the holy Ghost, and raileth
on the power of the liuing
God. Know that the time
shall come, when thy words
shall returne vpon thee, as
so many Lyons; yea, the di|uell,
who now sets thee on
worke, shall come to worke
vpon thee with torments:
but especially that blessed
Spirit, whom thou hast
reuiled, shall come against
thee, and teare thee in pie|ces,
and there shall be none
to deliuer thee. Thou seest
in the whole course of
such a mans life, a maine
current of honestie and
goodnesse; and who would

thinke that any should bee
so shamelesse to raile on
goodnesse, and to op|pose
against it? For the
verie opposing against
goodnesse, giues thee the
title of wickednesse, which
alone is the enemie there|of.
It shewes thou art a
souldier of the Dragon,
who goes out to make
warre with that blessed
seede, that keepes the
commandement of God.
But I doe know thy vsu|all
defences: thou wilt say,
that there are none worse,
then such as make such a
shew of purenesse, and
withall thou art furnished
with some merry tales, that
shew many mad trickes of
these ouer holie brethren.

Heere a little discretion and
iudgement in stead of salt,
would be of very good vse
to amend the sauour both
of thy heart and tongue.
For an vpright iudgement,
as it findeth many truths,
so toward the true discoue|rie
of this businesse, it fin|deth
these. First, that who|soeuer
is indeed good, shall
and must also seeme good;
for his works wil praise him,
whether he will or no; his
fruits wil shew what tree he
is, they must shine before
men, that men seeing them,
may glorifie God their hea|uenly
Father. Hence first we
conclude, that euerie one
that seemes good, is not an
hypocrite, but contrarily
he may bee one of Gods

chiefest seruants. There|fore
thou canst not pre|sently
fall to thy nickname
only for the shew of good|nesse.
Secondly, that there
is indeede a dissembled ho|linesse,
worne for a cloake
to wickednes, that the shape
of an Angell of light some
times couers a foule diuell,
yea, the foulest diuels are
they that most vse,  need
this couer. Now for this fel|low,
if thou findest him, pu|rita~
is too good a name for
him; for the Scripture hath
sharper names, as, generati|on
of Vipers, Wolues in
Sheepes clothing, and pain|ted
Sepulchers full of rot|ten
bones. These bee
they, whereon the diuell
sets the one foote, when

he kickes at true Christians
with the other, iustifying
by these, his railings on
those who especially hate
these, as the diuels chiefest
seruants. But now there
needs some discretion to
know these from the other,
that thou call not good e|uill,
nor euill good; nor a
Christian Hypocrite, nor
an Hypocrite, Christia~. To|ward
this thou must looke
to the fruites of both, and
that not a few particulars,
but to the generall. For a
Godly man is subiect to in|firmitie,
 hath some fals;
and an Hypocrite knowes
that to couer his wicked|nesse
hee must shew some
goodnes. But looke to the
continuall course of both,

and thou shalt finde, one
good generally, though
sometimes fraile; and the o|ther
often grosly transgres|sing,
though much coue|ring
his rotten heart. The
things wherein especially
thou shalt try the diffe|rence,
may be these. First a
loue to Christ: secondly, a
loue of Christs voice: third+ly,
a loue of the members
of Christ, and a reioycing
in them who excell in ver|tue.
Now these things will
againe appeare if for the
loue of Christ, the loue of
his word, and the loue of
his members, a man be or|dinarily
contented to lose
sinfull profits or pleasures,
and with the steward to
write 50. for an 100. This

is the touchstone of a Chri|stian,
euen the taking vp of
the Crosse, forsaking all,
and following Christ. But
this the hypocrite cannot
abide, he serues Christ, that
Christ may serue him, to
get pleasure and profit by
him, not to lose by him.


Part. 8.
But now heere come in
the many stories, which
condemne these purer men
to bee guiltie against these
duties, and so to be hypo|crites.
Yet runne not away
too fast with this neither,
but euen in the point of
hearing reports, take also
some discretion with you.
For against good men very
commonly, are bold and
confident slanders raised,

which by their stoutnesse
might seeme to bee truth it
selfe. But let not the wise
beleeue them before exami|nation.
For most common|ly
in the very telling of
them, will appeare a venom
and malice, the true issue of
the old Serpent: and vpon
farther triall, falshood and
lying, the naturall brother
of the former, and a truly
begotten sonne of the Ac|cuser
of the Brethren. He
began the rule in Paradise,
and will continue euen to
the new Ierusalem; lie bold|ly,
for some of it will sticke
fast for euer. And how can
it be otherwise, since the la|sinesse
of men is such, that
they will beleeue a re|port
at the first telling, ra|ther

then trouble them|selues
to examine and finde
out the truth, which onely
should be belieued;  with|all
their maliciousnesse is
so great, that they are wil|ling
and readie to receiue
euill reports, yea, they de|light
in them. But the ser|uants
of Christ know, that
the last iudgement shall be
by words, and that a rash
and a bitter iudge shall,
though not rashly, yet se|uerely
be iudged. Therefore
according to the Psalmist,
The good man is merciful,
and guideth his words with
discretion. He inclineth na|turally
to beleeue good ra|ther
then euill; yet auoi|ding
to condemne the iust,
hee also shunnes to iustifie

the wicked. Therefore that
his iudgement may bee
righteous, hee searcheth
both the matter how pro|bable
it is in it selfe; and
next he examineth the re-reporters,
whether they bee
those, in whom the truth
dwelleth, and who them|selues
haue a good report of
the truth; not being like
Pilate, ignorant, and yet to
learne what is truth. For it
is a kind of murther of our
neighbour in his name and
reputation (which is almost
as his life) both to beare
false witnes, and to receiue
false witnesse against him.
Lastly, a good man, if hee
may conueniently, will in|quire
of the partie himselfe,
or of some of his acquain|tance,

whether such things
haue beene done by him;
and if done, in what man|ner,
and vpon what occasi|on:
for many times the ma|ner
of things wholly alters
the matter, and the matter
may be good, in the man|ner
in which it was done,
yet euill in the manner be|stowed
on it by the repor|ter.
Againe, the thing be|ing
true, yet the occasion
and cause may, though not
iustifie, yet excuse the fact;
for many euill deeds are
done by infirmitie, which
yet prooue not the men e|uill
that did them. It were
pittie that men should go
to work this way with Da|uid,
and onely iudge of him
by his murder and adulte|rie:

but it rather becom|vs,
to see whether his course
of life being different from
his fact, do not manifestly
prooue, that these sinnes
were of infirmitie; of sinne
cleauing to him, not reign|ing
in sinne. And in this
point should euery man be
the milder; for as it is said
commonly in other mat|ters,
it is euery mans cause;
this mans to day, and thine
to morrow. And though
thou sweare with Peter, that
if al the world deny Christ,
thou wilt not denie him,
yet I wil neuer beleeue thee
no more then Christ did
Peter; for in many things
we sinne all, and as the A|postles
said, We are also men,
subiect to the same infirmities.



Part 9.
But if these cautions wil
not yet moderate the sa|uages
of this world, as in|deed
a foole, though braied
in a mortar, will not grow
wise: Yet, O thou man of
God, whosoeuer thou art,
that sufferest for Christs
sake, binde this rebuke to
thine head for a crowne,
and reioice that thou art
such a one as the diuell and
his followers hate; for hee
cannot be but good, whom
the diuell hateth. Reioyce
when men speake all euill
of thee falsely, and know
thou art now a brother of
Christ and his Saints in tri|bulation,
and in the king|dome;
for if thou suffer with
him, thou shalt also bee glo|rified

with him. The spirit,
whose shame now thou
bearest, shall hereafter cause
thee to beare his glorie; and
the more shame for his
sake, the more glorie. So
shall these Balaams, whose
hearts are so ready to curse
the people of God, be the
very meanes to procure a
blessing vnto them. For so
many curses, so many bles|sings;
therfore if there were
no offe~ce to God, nor hurt
nor pittie to themselues, we
might well suffer them to
curse apace, for they curse
vs as fast to glorie.


Part. 10.
From Christs time, place
is approoued by truth, not
truth by place. Hee that
freed true worship from be|ing

tied to Ierusalem, and
tied it to the seruice in spi|rit
which may be in all pla|ces,
gaue true religio~ a large
scope, euen as large as the
world it selfe. Therefore Ie|rusalem
being broken vp,
and true worship being set
free into the whole world,
let not Rome seeke to cap|tiue
her againe, and tie her
to the chaine thereof: for
they that worship in spirit
and truth, haue God plea|sed
with them, though such
worship bee in places, that
know not Rome to bee on
earth.



74
The Word of God is an
vndefiled Word, rightnes it
selfe; and therefore the most
perfect rule. Let there|fore

sinfull men frame their
liues to it, not seeke, as ma|ny
doe, to frame it to their
liues, and so to sinne by the
authoritie of righteousnes.
And let fraile and falling
man, though many of them
thinke they be the Church,
not trie this VVord by
themselues, whether it bee
right or not, but by the
VVord trie whether they
bee right, euen the right
and true Church; which is
knowne by this, that they
heare Christs voice, and
walke according to this
rule of Christ: Galathi|ans
6. 16.


75
Silly and foolish is the
pride, that any man takes
in his seruice toward God.

For first, the whole man
being from God, wee can
giue him out of man no|thing
but his own. Againe,
the whole man being due
to God, there can returne
no good thing from man
to God, but what is his due.
Thirdly, it is Gods free
choise, that vouchsafeth to
vse thy seruice, who refuseth
the imploiment of many
men, excellent in naturall a|bilities.
Certainly, we haue
seene many such of great
hope turned into earth, be|fore
any, or small vse of the~.
God Al-sufficient, who can
raise vp seruants of stones,
thus often sheweth, that
men haue need of God and
his choise, to doe him any
good seruice; but hee nee|deth

not them. Therefore
let vs rather thanke God,
then boast before him, if
he imploy vs in his seruice.
Let vs with humilitie readi|ly
performe it, as to that
great Lord, who hath refu|sed
infinite better, to be ser|ued
by vs; and whom there|fore
to serue is a happines 
priuiledge of ours fro~ him,
not a benefit of ours to him


76
Many seuerall women
were made for many seueral
men; if many had bin allot|ted
to one, there would
haue bin fewer of the mas|culine
sexe; for euen among
heardsmen, this rule is ob|serued.
But now there is a
kind of equality in number,
that euery one might haue

his mate diuidedly, without
diuiding with another. And
this which was indeed best
was first; for then there be|ing
but one woman to one
man, the sin which is now
vnlawfull, was then vnpos|sible.
What bare necessitie
was to man by creation,
let necessarie obedience
vnto God bee to the chil|dren
of regeneration; whose
speciall vertue, is to auoide
the ill which may be done.
Surely as running after lust
beyond this one, is endlesse
in regard of satisfaction, so
hath it a bad end in regard
of retribution, euen tor|mented
old age, that it can
sinne no more, and eternall
death for hauing so much
sinned.



77
When a man is possessed
by any lust, be it of coue|tousnesse,
concupiscence or
the like, there is set vp an
image in him, though not a
grauen one, which is to him
a God. This image wholly
filleth his minde, to it he
committeth idolatry, for
he offereth his whole heart
in sacrifice to it; and if he
can obtaine the thing ther|in
represented, he accoun|teth
himselfe happy, as in
the obtaining of God. Such
an image was there in A|hab
of Naboths vineyard,
and such a one of Bathshe|ba
in Dauid. But let vs take
heede of this worship of i|mages,
for it is but a vaine
shadow which steppeth in|to

to the place of God; It tel|leth
vs of happinesse, but it
selfe obtained goeth into
nothing,  robs vs of true
happinesse. Let vs rub out
therefore the print thereof
with prayer and holy me|ditations,
filling vp our
hearts with profitable and
eternall truthes, to keepe
out these dying and killing
vanities, let nothing posses
our hearts but God him|selfe,
who will one day glo|rifie
the place wherein he
dwels, and make it looke
like a temple of God: And
surely nothing but God is
worthy of a man.


78
God is the cause of all
vnder-causes and of all ef|fects;
in him is the fulnesse

of all things, the spring of
all beings. This world is a
determinate measure of his
effects. The naturall life at
the best is but a certaine
number of these effects, du|ring
a certaine peece and li|mit
of time. But the spiritu|all
life caused by our vnion
with God, is an euerlasting
and infinite enioying of
the infinite cause of all
things. Hereby shall wee
finde the Christian to bee
most perfectly happie, who
possesseth all things in their
cause, and beyond al things
that are, shall enioy the
cause it selfe. Infinite is the
difference betweene wise|dome
the cause, and wise|dome
the effect; light the
cause, and light the effect;

loue the cause, loue the ef|fect.
Therefore is earthly
Paradise wiped out, and the
Sunne shall be taken away,
and worldly pleasure eaten
vp by death. And from
hence haue wee infinite co~|fort,
for besides the blessed
end which comforteth all
labours, wee haue other
comforts in our way thi|ther.
For if some temporall
effects of God be now wan|ting,
yet in God they are
ready for vs, and farre more
excellent things, when it
shall be best for vs: for God
hauing co~municated him|selfe
to vs, we may certain|ly
beleeue, he cannot denie
things small in comparison
of him, when they shall be
for our good. Therefore

when he withholds them,
hee doth it as not beeing
good for vs: yea we may re|ioyce
in griefe, knowing
that a louing God and our
God is the very cause of it,
and that to our good. So
while our flesh by nature is
sad at the effect, our heart
by grace may reioyce con|fidently
in the cause. For
God vncha~geable, through
all our changes aymeth vn|changeably
to this end, our
good. Let all seeke God
with their whole heart;
since himselfe is our excee|ding
great reward; since all
things attend vpon him
ready to cast themselues
vpon them whom they see
fauored by him: And since
all things of what time soe|uer

that are cast on vs, are
turned into good by him
who dwelleth in vs.


79
If a good name be bet|ter
then a small parcell of
goods, then he that sits as
iudge of a mans good name
ought to proceede to sen|tence
vpon as firme eui|dence,
as the iudge of a
mans goods. If this were
obserued, men would heare
sufficient witnesses before
they fall to their censures:
Surely it is a great fault of
these times, that men are
sooner condemned to bee
wholly naught, then a pub|likely
accused-man, is to
haue stollen a sheepe. The
reason hereof is; There is a
drop of the great Serpents

venome powred into our
hearts, which breeds in vs a
willingnesse to heare euill
of our neighbours. But let
vs thirst for the medicina|ble
drops of grace,  sucke
the~ into our hearts, which
will fill vs with that loue
which reioyceth not in e|uill.
It is a pitiful thing that
creatures of one forme, of
one condition, should de|light
in the blemishes and
miseries of each other. But
when the diuell brought vs
to fall out with God, he al|so
brought vs to fall out a|mong
our selues, that loue
the fulfilling of the Law
might be perfectly broken.
Yet they that are new made
by Christ, must learne
Christs new commande|ment,

which is loue, and
be slowly and vnwillingly
led to beleeue euill of their
neighbour.


80
It is a good degree of
happinesse to haue a nature
inclining, yea in different to
those waies to which the
spirit bends it selfe, and
would bend it. Thence it
seemes a great aduantage
when a man hath in his na|ture
a coldnesse to Ambiti|on,
to the glory of this
world, to the pleasures of
the world, and when it
draweth, and contracteth
it selfe into a narrower con|tent,
being satisfied euen
with things necessarie. For
if we haue not this natural|ly
in vs, we must striue to

make it naturall by cu|stome,
because there is an
absolute necessity that wee
be such, or still striue to bee
such. For God must reigne
in vs if we will reigne with
him;  how doth he reigne
in vs, but by moderating
 guiding the minde with|in
the compasse of reason,
curbing and restraining
wilde and inordinate affe|ctions?
And this it seemes
is much the end of afflicti|ons
on the men whom God
loues, that there by taming,
swaging, and cooling their
nature, and as it were wa|shing
and taking away by a
priuation, the head-strong
affections which it beareth
to the world; the spirit
may vnresisted enter in, and

quietly worke his nature
into the afflicted. And as
for these naturall vertues,
though they bee not Chri|stian,
nor in themselues ac|ceptable
to God, while
they are meerely mooued
by nature, to a naturall
mans ends; yet when na|ture
is mooued to do them
by the spirit, from a right
cause which is the loue of
God, vnto the right end
which is the glory of God;
then the actions so done
by the seruice of nature, are
good  acceptable to God.
As for those whose croo|ked,
and more vnmannaga|ble
nature, standeth stiffe
against the discipline of the
spirit and their owne desi|res;
let them not therefore

despaire, because their euill
ground bringeth forth lesse
fruite,  more bryers then
the others. It pleaseth God
indeed to make thee one of
those to whom he appoin|teth
more labour, for the
promised penny; yet be not
wearie of well doing, for if
thou faint not, thou shalt in
due time receiue thy wa|ges.
If thou striue heartily
against thy euill and hate it,
God is pleased with thy
will and affection, as much
as the others action. Ther|fore
striue hopefully, ac|cording
to the might which
thou hast, praying for more;
and his grace is sufficient
for thee.


81
The wisedome of man

and the wisedome of God
are exceeding different, and
no maruaile: one being in|finitely
pure, and purely in|finite;
the other narrow, but
great in corruption. As in
all things therefore wee
should forsake our owne
wisedome, and leane vnto
Gods; so not with the least
care in the matter of re|uenge;
when thou hast suf|fered
some euill, thine own
wisedome bids thee re|turne
euill to the doer, but
the wisedome of God bids
thee to returne him good
notwithstanding this euill.
Hereat thou wondrest, and
thy flesh finds no wisdome
in this to returne good for
euill, to helpe him who
hurts thee: yet is the coun|sell

of thy wisedom, indeed
folly,  this of Gods, excel|lently
wise. For 1. in reuen|ging
thy self, thou dost foo|lishly;
for God hauing taken
to him self alone, the name
 power of being iudge of
the world, thou steppest in|to
this place and wilt bee
thy owne iudge. And God
hauing delegated part of
this power for a time vnto
Magistrates, thou intrudest
into their place, and so art
Rebellious both against
God and man. And indeed,
as thou hast made thy
selfe a iudge, so thou makest
thy selfe an executioner,
and art the hangman to ex|ecute
the sentence of thy
own malice: surely if a man
had robbed thee though

with some blowes, and were
apprehended and condem|ned
by the Magistrate, thou
wouldest take it a great dis|grace
to be appointed for a
hangman, or executioner
of him, who thus offendeth
thee; yet heere is nothing
but iustice: but when thine
owne wrath vsurping the
place of Iudgement, con|demnes
a man for a blow
or a word to die, then it is a
part of honour, to bee the
executioner of thy own vn|iust
and vnlawful sentence.
Be not deceiued, this latter
is the worse hangman of
the two. But to examine
thy folly neerer, how art
thou indeede auenged by
this, which thou thinkest
and callest reuenge? By in|truding

into Gods office,
thou hast taken the matter
out of Gods hands into
thine owne: but so where
before a God, and an of|fended
God was thy ene|mies
Iudge, who in his
wrath could cast both soule
and bodie into hell fire;
now a man hath vnderta|ken
him, who hath onely
power on the bodie, if yet
he haue so much: so instead
of a reuenger, thou hast
done the part of a redeemer,
and goest about to helpe
him, whom thou though|test
to hurt. Againe, where
God was before angry with
him alone, now he is angrie
with thee also, and so hast
thou lost thy aduantage,
which thou hadst vpon

him. Thou hadst the best
friend in the world for thee,
and against him: and now
thou hast by thy reuenge,
lost him equally with the
other. And lastly, him
whom thou censurest to
haue done euill, thou goest
about to imitate, and to
make thy selfe as bad as he.
And now that Gods coun|sell
to recompense good for
euill, is excellently wise, it
appeares hereby: certaine it
is, and to the godly certain|ly
knowne, that the eies of
God behold al things done
on earth; and he which be|holdeth
all things certain|ly,
shall as certainely iudge
all men, for all things done
in their flesh. Therefore if a
man wrong thee, know that

this wrong is seene, that it
is recorded, that it shall bee
iudged. And if thou coul|dest
now but see, or right|ly
imagine that terrible
iudgement, which shall bee
inflicted on those which
touch Gods anointed, thou
wouldest pitty them, whom
now thy vengeance would
punish. Surely fire and
brimstone, cries and tor|ments,
darknesse and di|uels
are their portion;
though it bee not present,
yet it shall be present, and
the weight of the paine shal
recompence the stay. Again,
the moore good thou art,
the more God will pitty
thee, the more God will
plague him that wrongeth
thee. For the more good,

the dearer to God, and the
more odious are those that
offend thee. Therefore if
thou wilt bee reuenged on
thy enemie, bee still doing
of good as to all, so to him
among all; and thy good|nesse
shall bring God the a|uenger
vpon him, and shall
heape coales of fire vpon
his head, in the day of the
highest vengeance. Pos|sesse
thy soule in good|nesse,
in patience, and
bee not mooued from thy
place to doe euill; then shalt
thou dwel assuredly in hap|pinesse,
and shalt see thy
desire vpon thy enemies;
whatsoeuer the wicked do,
thou knowest thy part;
though he doth the works
of a wicked man, thou still

art to bring forth the fruits
of a good man; hee doth
what belongs to a seruant
of his master: do thou what
belongs to the seruice of
thine, and at last thou shalt
see his Lord and himselfe
made the foote stoole of thy
Lord, and cast downe into
vtter darkenesse, where shal
be weeping and gnashing
of teeth. Then shall this
thy Lord, who casteth him
into hell, exalt thee into
heauen: and as your waies in
this life were diuers, so shall
they bee in the next; and
then shall it be no griefe of
mind to thee, when thou
art in that glorious king|dome,
that thy hand hath
not shed blood, nor wick|edly
auenged thy wrongs.



82
The nature of man by
the corruption thereof ma|keth
a God of whatsoeuer
it listeth. Therefore rightly
is Idolatrie by the Apostle,
reckoned among the works
of the flesh, it being a work
to which the flesh is prone.
This hath the wicked cu|stome
of mankind grossely
declared, while some make
their wealth a god; some
haue taken men for gods,
as the Barbarians did Paul
and Barnabas: and some
haue made gods for all oc|casions,
as did the Romans.
But among the rest, this
corruption of the flesh, hath
a speciall lust and desire of
some glorious and faire
image, to make to it selfe a

God. And this it doth not,
by beleeuing the outward
substance, as gold or wood,
to be a God of it selfe, but
that some diuine spirit in|habiteth
and possesseth it,
and so maketh it diuine
by dwelling in it. This
inclination and readinesse
of man to idolatrie is ex|pressed
often in Scripture
Ieremie 10. Ezechiel 16.
Iudges 2. Yea, it hath so
farre preuailed, that men
haue beene inflamed with
Idols, vnder euerie greene
tree, burning in lust to|ward
them; yea they haue
adored and worshipped
the very images of their
friends which they kept
as remembrances of them,
Wisd. 13. 10. and more par|ticularly,

the image of the
serpent which healed them,
2. King. 18. If this was the
inclination of mans nature
in former times, how can
wee but still looke for the
same fruites of the same
roote? The same corrupt
nature, yea worse in these
last times still dwelleth in
vs; it is as neere kin to I|dols
as euer it was, and the
diuell rageth more then e|uer
hee did, knowing his
time to be short. Therefore
if an image was a stumbling
blocke, and a teacher of
lies, how do they teach the
truth, that teach images?
Where they are publike|ly
proposed vnto corrupt
and fraile mankinde, yea
where they are proposed to

be worshipped with the ho|nour
due to the patterne,
yea where they doe or are
said to do great and diuine
wonders, what can be loo|ked
for, but that the same
mankinde which worship|ped
images in old time, and
by that worship were idola|ters,
will worship images
with the same worship
now, and now also become
idolaters? The same man,
the same image, and the
same idolatry. But now
they are taught not to wor|ship
them with diuine wor|ship.
And then they were
taught by the second com|mandement,
not to wor|ship
them at all. Thy pro|posing
of them doth draw
men more to them, then

thy teaching doth deterre
from them. Say what thou
wilt, if thou put an image
before a man of flesh. Flesh
and the image will toge|ther
commit idolatry. Wilt
thou take thy faire wife, and
leaue her with a lustfull
man, and tell him he shall
only passe the time with
her in ciuill conference.
The Lord of hosts, is as ie|lous
of his spouse, as thou
of thy wife; he wil not haue
temptations set before her,
and therefore forbids alto|gether
the making of ima|ges
for any worship. Besides
the ignorant man vnder|stands
not the difference
betweene Dulia and Latria,
but falls heartily to his
businesse, and thinkes he

cannot do it amisse if he do
it with all his heart. And if
hee did vnderstand it, yet
when it doth miracles, how
can they not worship it?
since euen for that Israel
worshipped the serpent,
which their story told them
to haue beene made of
Brasse. Therefore let men
cease to lay stu~bling blocks
before the blinde, though
they hang vp lanternes by
their sides. Let them not
ioyne with the diuell to
make temptations: yea let
them auoide euen images
of remembrances in the
place of worship, since such
haue drawne worship aside
from God vnto them: And
cursed is hee that maketh
the blinde to goe out of the

way. Deut. 27.


83
The estates and functi|ons
in this world, conside|red
alone, and not in order
 respect to the next, meet
altogether at the end of life
in the same point of vani|ty,
howsoeuer by the way
different in the apparance
of outward glory. And in
this way, those that are got|ten
aboue necessity and
miserie, haue so confused,
vnknowne,  mixt a good|nesse,
that they still turne
our thoughts forcibly from
themselues, and send them
beyond themselues vnto
another kinde of beeing, to
finde fulnesse and satisfa|ction.
The higher estate,
which is that of power and

action, pleaseth it selfe in
the preheminence thereof,
and beholding it selfe a
cause  moouer of effects.
But the end of a thing be|ing
the excellency  crown
thereof, and the naturall
end of action, and motion
being rest, it seemes that
the lower estates enioying
this most, enioy most the
chiefest, and haue the ad|uantage
of the fruite, while
the other hath the com|mendation
of being an ex|cellent
roote. Yet the grea|test
are most contented to
be so, and the lesser might
be contented, but they will
not; and so is there a confu|sion
herein: that imagina|tion
maketh some conten|ted
with labour, while more

substantiall rest, will not sa|tisfie
others. Besides this
vexation of minde, there is
another: That to be farre a|boue
miserie, is a miserie:
and desires preuented, par|take
much of the trouble of
desires vnsatisfied. For man
being made of lust, it is a
torment to him, not to
lust; and so while men hunt
after an excesse of fulnesse,
they hunt after their owne
torment: yet is there a great
path beaten by these run|ners
after extremities, who
know not the sweet bound
and point of enough, be|yond
which, their striuing
is labour for losse. Againe,
the supposed excellency,
and highest perfection of
mankinde, being common|ly

imagined to bee at the
state and ripenesse of man|hood,
yet in that indeede is
man most miserable, as be|ing
then lanched forth like
a full built ship into the
world, a sea of cares and
sorrowes; Then also know|ledge
increased, increaseth
sorrow, giuing man a more
full taste of his owne mise|rie.
But youth is free from
care, and hath strong enioy|ings
of smal  easie things;
for youth couers all things
with its own pleasantnesse,
whereas age is sad in spite
of obiects, colouring them
also with it owne deadnes:
Yet youth desireth man|hood,
and is tormented for
lacke of it, and after is pu|nished
with hauing it. If

then the ripenesse of man,
euen mans best, is a station
of care; if he grow from
pleasure as he groweth into
manhood, and yet tendeth
vnto manhood as vnto his
perfection; it seemes the
very being and perfection
of man is a beeing of care
and trouble, and that man
is verily borne to labour as
the sparkes flie vpward.
Now what is there left to
be thought of man? but
that he was not made only
for vanitie and miserie, and
that this miserie hath a far|ther
and a better end, euen
happinesse it selfe. We are
here brought into a state of
trouble, and straitnesse, but
it is, that seruing God first
in labour, we should after

come to his rest; and that
the consideration of this
rest should be our comfort
in the time of our labour.
Let vs therefore worke on
strongly in the worke of
God imposed vpon vs,
knowing that after the sixe
daies labour, commeth rest
of the seauenth. And let our
eyes be continually on the
ioyes which follow, and
not on the paine which is
present: the ioyes beheld
must needs incourage vs,
for their sight is comforta|ble,
and especially because
wee are sure they are ours.
The paine neglected and
vnregarded, cannot be very
disco~fortable; the thought
not beeing grieued with
that which is not beheld

by it. Thus did Christ
looke stedfastly on glorie,
and so despised the shame,
and endured the crosse; and
so doth God himselfe, in
the sufferings of his ser|uants.
The world indeede
wonders who sees but halfe
of the matter, when it be|holds
the sufferings of iust
and holy men. They won|der
that God takes no more
pitty on them, but suffers
the fire, the axe, and the
tormenter to haue power
ouer them. But then God
who beholds at once the
whole estate of a Christian,
sees both the torments pre|sent,
and the glory follow|ing;
and hee iudgeth the
short and finite torments to
be the gaine  aduantage

of his seruants, since they
cause a great accesse of in|finite
glory. Therefore let
vs be so minded as God and
his Christ are, and walke
on valiantly in sanctified
miserie vnto true felici|tie.

Most men in part, or in
whole are Gadarens, or
Capernaites. The Gadaren,
if hee lose any thing by
Christ, desires him to depart
out of his coasts, and will
lose Christ, rather then his
swine. The Capernaite fol|lowes
Christ, but it is to be
filled; so he seekes Christ
for his belly, and makes his
belly the ende of Christ.
These things are too vsu|all
among vs, wee are rea|die

to shrinke from Christ,
as soone as our profits or
pleasures shrinke from vs;
because of Christ, wee will
not be saued our selues, ex|cept
wee may haue euerie
thing else safe aswell as our
selues: we will bee both Di|ues
and Lazarus, wee will
haue happinesse both here
and hereafter, which may
not bee: for this is to knit
together, what God hath
parted asunder. Equally
wicked is their purpose,
that intend to make an
occupation of Christ to get
fauour, riches, or prefer|ment
by him; that turne
Christ from his, of be|ing
a Sauiour, and vse
him as Merchandize: who
take the ladder of Iacob,

by which wee should as|cend
into heauen, and
peruerting the vse of it,
thereby clime downeward
to the things of this earth.
But miserable and foolish
man, thou both robbest 
destroiest thy selfe with this
thy policie. Christ would
haue done farre greater
things for thee, and thou
wilt onely haue him helpe
thee to the lesse: he would
haue giuen thee an euerla|sting
Kingdome, a Treasure
that is farre aboue theeues
and rust; but thou hadst ra|ther
receiue lesse and worse
things from him, transitory
honour, and rustie treasure.
Thou art a child in vnder|standing;
thou takest an
apple, and refusest a iewell:

But he that is verily Christs
Disciple, auoids these cor|ruptions.
He knowes Christ
to bee such an inestimable
Pearle and happinesse, that
if hee haue Christ, though
with the losse of father or
mother, wife or children,
life or land, yea, with perse|cutions;
yet the possession
of him yeelds a hundred
fold more comfort in this
life, and in the life to come
eternall felicitie. He is still
a gainer amid all his losses,
yea he gaines by his losses;
for losses for Christ gaine
great comfort and assu|rance
in this world, that the
losers are accounted wor|thie
to lose any thing for
Christ; and hereafter in the
next world, shall they gaine

an exceeding reward of
glorie. The same Disciple
also out of the same estima|tion
of Christ, highly dis|daineth
to make any other
end of Christ, but Christ
himselfe. Yea hee so high|ly
preferreth Christ aboue
all things, that he accounts
all things dung, so he may
win Christ; Christ is the
marke of his desires, hee
sees nothing beyond him,
but all things farre short of
him: He knowes Christ to
be infinitely better then all
things, and therefore vseth
the worse as helpes to the
better; but farre it is from
him, to propose the bet|ter
only as a meanes vn|to
the worse. So he passeth
through all other things as

a Pilgrime, but takes vp his
rest in Christ alone. He
walkes along treading on
earth, and earthly things,
with his eies and heart fix|ed
on his Sauiour in hea|uen:
To conclude, he is so
farre from selling Christ, to
get any thing, y^t he will sell
al things to obtaine Christ:
Now true loue, the fruite of
a true faith, makes this
yoke easie, and this com|mandement
light.


85
The naturall man hath
in him an inclination to be
proud in the enioying of
such things as haue any ex|cellence,
though himself be
not the Author of that ex|cellence,
and sometimes
though he haue therby no

addition of worth to his
owne person. So in the first
kinde he is proud of a good
wit, and in the second, is
he proud of a proud horse,
of a rich iewell, of an im|brodered
garment. And ac|cordingly
hee attributeth
more glory to himselfe, for
possessing them, then to
the Author and giuer, for
creating and giuing them:
yea commonly all the glo|ry
to himselfe, the standing
poole, and none to the
spring. But the true Chri|stian,
euen the new borne
sonne of God, rips vp this
swelling deceit, and striues
to free his soule from it, and
to bring her to a true and
iust discerning of things.
To this end bending her

eye to the contemplation
of truth, shee findes that
chiefe and only glory be|longeth
to the giuer, not to
the receiuer; to the Crea|tor,
not to the thing made.
Shee sees no reason that she
should boast of anothers
worke, nor that shee should
be proud of what shee hath
receiued; but rather shee
seeth great reason, that the
creature should giue all glo|ry
to the Creator, and the
receiuer to the giuer. For
the borrower is a seruant
to the lender, his receiuing
is an implied subiection,
and hee oweth to him the
thing lent, much more the
glory of the thing. Accor|dingly
the sanctified cry
out: Sing ye loud to the

Lord all the earth; for the
Lord is God, he hath made
vs, and not wee our selues:
And, Thou art worthie 
Lord to receiue glory, ho|nour,
and power, for thou
hast created all things. This
if puft vp man would right|ly
consider, hee would re|member
by the benefits of
God, to glorifie God his
Benefactor, not himselfe,
the almesman of God. And
thogh knowledge by mans
corruption is made an in|strument
of puffing vp, yet
knowledge pursued to this
point by sanctification,
would humble and abase.
For it would shew vs that
wee must glorie in our
owne, not in our debts. Ra|ther
thereby as borrowers

and owners wee should be|come
humble acknowled|gers
of our owne subiecti|on
and obligation to him
who lendes and bestowes.
But miserable and distra|cted
man, how farre dost
thou wander from this du|tie?
thou art proud of a
chaine borrowed of thy
neighbour, howmuch more
wilt thou bee of a greater
thing giuen thee of thy
God? Rather breake off thy
sins by repentance, humble
thy false swelling,  abate
the wisedome of thy foo|lish
flesh; yea let all glorie
which other giue thee, re|flect
from thee to thy ma|ker,
who only is the true
rest of glory. Then if thou
glorifie him, thou shalt be

glorified by him, w^c is the
glory thou especially shoul|dest
seeke for vnto thy self;
so maist thou aspire by hu|mility
which is the only ho|nour:
yea most ready way
of aspiring. But if thou doe
it not, know that pride is
the especiall barre of Gods
mercies; Pride keepes out
God, and many might haue
beene farre more sanctified,
if they had beene farre lesse
proud. For God enters not
into the soule that acknow|ledgeth
not him nor his be|nefits;
those that are farre
from beholding him, hee
beholdeth afar off. But in|to
the humble soule, that
giueth him abundance of
glory; he enters with abun|dance
of grace, sowing

there, and there only plen|ty
of grace, where he is assu|red
to reape plenty of glo|ry.
Now let vs beware that
what God soweth for him|selfe
wee reape not to our
selues, lest we be found rob|bers
of God: but being as
labourers in that haruest on|ly
for him, let vs be content
with our wages of labou|ring,
which wil be sufficient
yea an exceeding great re|ward
to vs; for great glorie
shall be giuen to those in
the next world, to whom
God giueth grace to bee
humble in this world.


86
It is pittie we haue so
wholly taken vp our minds
with the controuersies, be|tweene
vs  the Pope, that
wee haue much neglected

the more immediate con|trouersie
between vs  the
diuell. It is good that thou
lay thy hand on this, and
forget not the other. The
chiefe superedification on
Faith is Loue, and this loue
tends to the fulfilling of the
commandements. Herein
are the children of God
knowne, and the children
of Satan. Hee that lo|ueth
is borne of God, and
he that loueth not, hath
not seene God, but the
wrath of God abideth on
him. But as loue must bee
had, so must it be had to
some purpose, it must bee
vseful,  bring forth the na|turall
 kindly fruite there|of,
which is keeping the
commandements. But the

blacknesse of darkenesse is
so thicke on the soule of
man by his fall, that he can|not
see the good which he
would doe; and hence it is,
that often loue brings the
children of good workes to
the birth, but there is no
strength of knowledge to
deliuer them. Many there
are who haue consciences
great with charitie, yet in
many things for want of
knowledge, they either ab|staine
from doing at all, be|cause
they know not what
is right to be done, or som|times
mistake euill for
good, and so offend God in|stead
of pleasing him. Now
lamentable it is to see zeale
and deuotion mispent, to
see a good minde bring

forth euill fruits,  the holy
but diuine soule to goe
cleane contrary to y^t way it
purposeth. And this thogh
neglected, very much aba|teth
y^e glorie  prosperitie
of the light, and enlargeth
the power and limits of the
kingdome of darkenesse.
And as much darkenesse as
is left, so much roome is
there left for Sata~, so much
territory is there allowed
to him; which as we should
striue wholly to gaine from
him, so especially in those
which belong not to him,
but haue giuen themselues
to the God of light, to
walke as children of the
light. Be it therefore the
precious  worthy labour
of some Bezaleel or Aholiab,

some one whose heart God
hath touched and inlight|ned,
to lighten and kindle
many of the yet-dim-shi|ning
lampes which are in
the house of God. Let them
be eies to the blinde, and
let them ioyne with the spi|rit
of God, saying in the
voice thereof, This is the
way, walke in it. Let them
breake abroad the com|mandements
of God into
their seuerall branches of
things forbidden, and com|manded,
that he which run|neth
may reade, and hee
which readeth, may runne
aright. Then shall many a
worke of darkenesse be pre|uented,
and the workes of
light shall spring in farre
greater aboundance. Then

shall the Prince of darknes
bee chased much farther
from vs, and the God of
light shall dwell more
powerfully and fully in vs.
Then shalt thou, whoso|uer
thou art, that turnest
a soule from sinning, shine
as the starres in heauen;
the blessing of him that
hath receiued instruction
from thee, shall bee vpon
thee, and thou shalt haue
an especiall part in that
welcome of Christ, in the
day of Christ: Come thou
blessed of my Father; for
when I was hungrie and
imprisoned in my me~bers,
pining for want of know|ledge,
and fettered with ig|norance,
thou didst en|large
mee, thou didst feede

and increase me. But if the
spirituall lawyers shall not
be so diligent to search, and
set forth Cases of Consci|ence,
as the secular Law|yers
are to publish Cases of
transitorie and temporall
right, let them expect to
haue a chiefe part in that
curse of Christ: Woe be to
you Lawyers, for ye with|hold
the key of knowledge,
ye either enter not your
selues, or you do not helpe
those that would, to enter.


87
The man who intends
deseruedly to get the name
of a Christian, hath vnder|taken
a worke called morti|fication,
a denying of vn|godly
lusts, euen a dying to
sin, that he may liue in the

spirit of Christ. He that pur|poseth
the end, must like|wise
intend the meanes, els
his purpose is not effectual,
and is not indeed a purpose
of the end. Now if hee se|riously
intend to vse the
meanes, a speciall part of
that meanes will bee a true
search and notice of the
lustes which he must denie,
and chiefly of the chiefest;
which excell in force, or in
height of corruption. For
this must he looke into the
nature of man in generall,
into the nature of the men
of that countrie or place
where he dwelles, and into
the custome (which is also
a nature) of men at that
time when he liues, and es|pecially
into the ma~, which

is himself. This being done,
let him take the rule of the
law,  lay it on ma~ thus di|stinctly
co~sidered;  he shal
find both wherein lust hath
bowed mankind in general
from that rule,  wherein e|minently
 especially men
of that country men of that
time, and wherein his owne
hart. And this being found,
he hath then his worke be|fore
him, he sees what hee
must generally denie, and
what parts of the generall
with his chiefest strength
he must resist; and what he
thinkes fit to resist himself,
let him also prouoke others,
to resist the same. If wee
make not this search at all,
lust may come to our harts
not known to be lust, but in

the shape of righteousnes, or
at least, couered by custome
fro~ appearing to be vnrigh+teousnes,
and so may be ad|mitted.
If wee make this
search, and that but general,
we may indeed find al vices
and so may bee mooued to
make a general resistance to
al. But yet if we make not a
different resistance, that is,
more setled  strong against
the stronger, (such as are
those of our nation, time 
person) by not matching
them, wee our selues are o|uermatched,
and so ouer
maistered. This knowledge
as it is in it selfe necessarie,
so it may be knowne to be
such, because our mercifull
God, by a long succession
of Prophets, taught and im|parted

it to man. Hee sent
early and late his faithfull
messengers to tell Iacob his
sinnes, and Israel his trans|gressions,
to disswade the
wicked that he turne from
his wickednesse, and liue.
And as those Watchmen of
God, marked the accesse
and inroade of sinnes, to
giue warning both to the~|selues
and others, that they
should not perish in the de|luge
of vices; so should
there be a perpetuall watch
kept by the Saints and ser|uants
of God, ouer them|selues
and others, that they
may not bee ignorant of
Satans policies; that the
Foxes bee taken betimes,
which destroy the Vine|yard;
and that all leauen of

errours or maliciousnesse
may be purged, as soone as
mixed. And indeed what
worke doth more profita|blie
imploy the skilful ma|ster-builders
and edifiers,
then the finding and repai|ring
of the ruines of the Ci|tie
of God? That is buil|ding
indeede, to bring a
stone into a decaied place,
not to fill vp that which is
already full. That is most
properly fortifying, which
giues strength, to the place
that needeth it, not to that
which is alreadie safe.
wherefore let both Prophets
and people labour herein,
vntill time shal be no more,
that the breaches of Ieru|salem
may bee both found
and repaired; that the ene|mie

bee kept out at his pla|ces
of aduantage, that Sa|tan
may haue no new en|gin,
but that there may be
a defence readie against it;
vntill our Lord Iesus, the
founder and foundation of
his Church appeare. Who
now building by the Mini|sterie
of his Prophets, will
then commend and exalt
those that haue been the
wise and faithfull builders,
and will lift vp the whole
Citie once perfectly built
into the safetie and blessed|nesse
of his owne presence,
for euer and euer.
The Spirit and the Bride say,
Come, euen so, come Lord
Iesus.
