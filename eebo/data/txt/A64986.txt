AN
Explicatory Catechism:
OR, AN
EXPLANATION
OF THE
ASSEMBLIES
SHORTER
Catechism.
WHEREIN
Those Principles are enlarged
upon especially, which obviate the
great and growing Errors of Popery;
useful for those Families that desire to
hold fast the Form of sound words.

To the Christian Reader; espe|cially
Heads of Families.
THose Catechisms may very well
be esteemed the best, which are
Explanatory of the Creed, ten
Commandments and the Lords
Prayer; because these Summaries or Ab|stracts
contain the Essentials of the true Re|ligion,
or those choice truths which God
would have us take extraordinary notice of
in our course of reading the holy Scriptures:
And therefore those that begin with Cate|chizing,
begin the most easie and profitable
way for any; because the weightier matters
of the Law are not hard to be understood,
and such words being Spirit and Life, and
the very marrow of Christianity, must needs
feed and nourish us up unto eternal life. I
have fixed my thoughts upon the Assemblies
shorter Catechism, because the Principles
in it are mostly agreed upon by all sober intel|ligent

unprejudiced Protestant Divines. You
have also something of the nature of the two
Covenants superadded to, or rather enlarged
upon more particularly and expresly than in
the Catechism. And because Catechisms ought
to contain nothing but received truths, you
have mostly the Explication of Antient and
Modern Divines: And therefore, where you
meet with any thing that is not so elaborate
and exact, you may conclude it mine, and
not theirs. Hearing occasionally a Discourse
of a very learned and godly Divine out of
Deut. 6. 6, 7. [And these words which I
command thee this day, shall be in thy
heart: And thou shalt teach them dili|gently
unto thy Children, c.] who re|commended
to Parents with the greatest ear|nestness
the work of Catechizing; I shall
make bold to transcribe a part of it, and
offer it to publick view. You shall have, 1. His
Reasons to prove that Parents ought diligent|ly
to Catechize or teach their Children [Ser|vants
also included.] 2. His Answers to
the Objections against it. And 3. The Mo|tives
he laid down to provoke and stir up all
Parents to this necessary duty.
10. Reasons for the proof of it.
1. Every man ought to promote the Glory
of God, to advance the Kingdom of Christ,

and to further the Salvation of others as far
forth as they are able, and have opportunity
to it. And can we effect these any better
way? We pray, Hallowed be thy Name.
Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done:
Surely the coming of Christs Kingdom into
our hearts is one way of his Kingdom's
coming.
2. God hath set Parents in Authority
over them, and they cannot improve it to
better purpose. This is the most ancient Go|vernment.
Before there was King or Com|mon-wealth,
there was Parental Government.
This being most ancient, afterwards was the
Priest and Prophet. God hath laid a com|mand
upon Children to obedience in the fifth
Commandment, Ephes. 6. 1. Only Dig|nity
requires duty; improve your authority
for God, and use it to instruct your House|hold
in the Word of God. Do not think
you have done, till you have done this.
3. Even nature it self dictates thus much.
The Birds and Beasts of the field, yea the
Sea-monsters take care of their young ones.
If you do nothing but feed and cloath your
Children, you do no more than Heathens, nay
than brute beasts. 'Tis said of the Ostrich,
Job 39. 16. that she is hardened against
her young ones, as though they were not hers:

And what do ignorant Parents less, who are
hardened against their own Children who
are parts of themselves?
4. Children have Souls to be saved or
damned, therefore some must take care of them,
and the soul that sinneth must die. We see
Children die as well as Aged persons.2 Cor. 5. 10 In
Golgatha there are Skulls of all sorts: Yea,
do but look into the Register of a Parish, and
you shall see as many young as old have died
in it. Children may die, and what if they
die without knowledge, in their sins? better
were it with those Children mentioned,
2 Kings 2. 23, 24. than these, Isa. 27. 11.
2 Thes. 1. 7, 8. Thus unchastised Children
shall suffer; but the Parents shall not go
Scot-free. If you would have them profit
by the publick Ministry, you must Catechize
them at home. To bring them to the publick
before they be thus Catechized, is setting
before them an hard loaf. You must give
them milk at home, that they may be fit for
higher truths in publick.
5. Your Children are Children of wrath,
and you have been instruments to conveigh
this to them.Psal. 51. 1, 5 They die, and that proves this.
When your Children are sick, you forthwith
go to the Physitian, and will you take no care of
their Souls, inheriting their spiritual mala|dies

from you? You may say as David to
Abiathar, 1 Sam. 22. 22. I have occasion|ed
the death of all the persons of thy
Fathers house.
6. What will become of Religion in future
Ages, if Parents neglect this duty at present?
If all Parents were as careless as some, the
Church of God would soon cease on the earth,
Isa. 38. 19. The Father to the Children
shall make known thy truth, Psal. 78. 3, 4.
Which we have heard and known, and our
Fathers have told us; We will not hide
them from their Children, shewing to the
Generation to come the praises of the
Lord. If we do not teach our Children how
should they teach theirs? It was above two
thousand years before the Scripture was writ|ten;
how then was piety preserved but by one
Generation teaching another? Adam taught
his Children. The sacrificing of Cain, and
Abel's piety therein were both the fruit of
Adam's teaching. Noah taught his Children
to Abraham, and he taught his houshold.
Isa. 1. 9. Except the Lord of Hosts had left
unto us a very small Remnant, we should
have been as Sodom, and we should have
been like unto Gomorrah: We should have
been as Heathenish, as Paganish as they.
7. God is highly pleased with piety in younger

ones. The Lord had respect to Abel the younger;
and Enoch of all the Patriarchs before the
Flood the youngest, is said to please God. How
was God pleased with the piety of Samuel
and Josiah? And we read of Jehojachin that
began very young to Reign; and did that
which was evil in the sight of the Lord,
2 Kings 24. 8, 9. God takes notice of the
evil as well as the good. Children might sing
Hosanna,Mat. 21. 15. as well as cry bold-head, if they
were taught. Iesus said, Mat. 19. 14.
Suffer little Children, and forbid them not
to come unto me: for of such is the King|dom
of Heaven. Of such, not untaught
Children.
8. You cannot expect the blessings of the
Covenant, except yu teach them the Cm|mandments
of God Ps. 103. 17, 18. Dan. 9. 4.
9. Assure your selves, if you neglect this
duty, God will require their blood at your
hands, Gen. 9. 5. with Acts 20. 26. It is
here with Parents as with Ministers; if you
do not warn and teach them, God will re|quire
their blood at your hands. Ezek. 3. 18.
Object. But teaching is the work of the
Minister?
Answ. It is not only his, but yours; his
in publick, yours in your Families.
10. Sin and corruption is so inherent in

Children in their nature, that all the care of
Ministers in publick, and Parents at home
will be little enough to heal this plague of
original corruption.Levit. 14. 41, c. This plague is like the
Leprosie. There must be scraping, and if
cleansing will not do, there must be pulling
down. So that you see all is little enough:
without teaching, your Children may perish,
and you smart for it.
Object. 1. But Children may do well
that are not thus carefully instructed.
Answ. 1. They may do well as to the out|ward
man, they may prosper in the world.
God may cause his Sun to shine upon the un|just
and the unthankful. But Parents are
to wish that their Children may do well as to
the inward man, and prosper in their Souls,
as John for his friend Gaus, 3 Joh. 2.
2. They may perish eternally for want of
Knowledge. Hos. 4. 6.
3. If some Children happen to come to good,
no thanks to such careless graceless Parents
that neglect instruction at home.
Object. 2. But we have known them
that have been taught well enough to
have made bad proof?
A. 1. This is too sadly true, to be denied;
But the fault may be in one of the Parents
by their bad example: And Children as well

as the conclusion in syllogizing will follow the
worse and weaker part; yet this is blame|worthy
in Parents.
2. Good Parents have severely smarted for
their neglect of strict Discipline in their Fa|milies,
and their over great fondness in cock|ring
their Children, as you may read in Eli
and David. 1 Sam. 3. 13. 2 Sam 13, and
14, and 15. 1 Kings 1. 6.
3. But if the Children of good Parents
prove bad, this should make us more diligent.
If a Garden well weeded and kept down prove
thus ill; Is this any encouragement to sloth,
but rather a spur to double diligence?
Two or three Motives to excite to the Du|ty
of Catechizing.
Let it be remembred that you are not per|swaded
to invade the ministerial office, or to
become of this or that Opinion or Party, but
to fall forthwith upon the practice of a mani|fest,
yet indispensable Duty.
1. How doth the love of God dwell in your
hearts, when they are hardened against your
Children? Simon, lovest thou me? then
feed my Lambs. They are Gods Children,
and therefore you must bring them up in the
ture and admonition of the Lord. The
Children of any in Covenant with God are
called his Children, Ezek. 15. 21. When the

woman of Samaria knew Christ, she desired
that all her Neighbours might also know him.
2. Are they not your Children? You shall
diligently teach them to your Children; they
are bone of your hone, and flesh of your flesh.
Are we to instruct one another, and not our
own Children?
3. What a comfort will this be to you, if
you faithfully discharge this most profitahle
Duty! For,
1. Such Parents shall have joy of their Chil|dren,
Prov. 23. 24. Ruth 4. 15. David and
Bathsheba had much comfort of Solomon,
which they had not of their other Children.
2. You shall have spiritual rejoycing,
2 Joh. 4.
3. You will gain a good evidence of the
truth of grace in your hearts.
4. You that thus propagate piety shall
sow good seed that will endure to many Ge|nerations,
Jer. 33. 18.
5. You may avoid many crosses and heart-breaking
sorrows which negligent Parents
ordinarily meet with. Abraham taught his
Children, and see what comfort he had of
them: He had a numerous Family 318. in|structed
Servants born in his own house
[Gen. 14. 14.] and yet no disorder or distur|bance
there: He had a numerous Family, and
yet a peaceable Family.
1. Abraham Circumciseth Ishmael,Gen. 17. and
yet it was a painful Sacrament.
2. Isaac makes no oppsitin when to be
made a sacrifice to the Will of God.Gen. 22
3. Yu have a religious Servant. Gen.
15, and 24.
4. At his death he gives what portions he
pleaseth, and yet you find no discord among
them, Gen. 25. 5, 6. As you therefore desire
peace in your Families, and in after Genera|tions,
bring them up in the fear of the Lord.
On the contrary, you Parents that teach
your Children Arts and Trades, and not Gods
Commandments; why, you are making way
for your own cross and vexation; what heart|breaking
will they be to you! As,
1. In their matching. Prov. 17. 21, 25.
Gn. 26. 34. 35.
2. Their sins will be put upon your score;
and have you not sins enough of your own?
3. Their perishing will be put upon your
account. Oh what fretting and cursing will
there be at your meeting your Children in
Hll! Have you not heard of Children that
have cursed Parents upon the Gallows? Oh,
when the Word of God tells you that some evil
will befall your Children, how should this trou|ble
you! As it was said of Jeroboam, that he
made Israel to sin (for all that succeeded pur|sued

his sins) even so you, by your cursed ig|norance,
negligence and slth may propagate
sin and misery from Generation to Generati|on,
to your Children.
We are to look upon this duty as one of the
prime Ordinances of divine institution: there
was Family teaching before there was any
other teaching. 'Tis the opinion of an eminent
Divine, that more Children are seasoned with
grace by istection of Paents than by
preaching. Towns are made up of Families,
and where they are wicked in Towns, King|doms
cannot e righteous. Our misery begins
in bad Families. This duty of Catechizing
therefore is of as great weight, as any which
is commanded in the word of God. Thus far
he whose name I shall conceal, because I have
published it without his privity and consent,
though I hope not against his liking and ap|probation.
If any of you shall please diliently
and impartially to examine Concordnces,
and most Catechisms; you will soon find that
the former do furnish us rather with sounds
than sense; and that in the latter, upon com|paring
the truths and the alledged Texts to|gether,
there is so wide a distance, that you
will the better perceive the dfficulty of our
present undertaking (notwithstanding all the
forementioned helps) than at first, possibly, you

have imagined. If you find any pertinency of
the Scriptures produced for confirmation of
the truths they refer unto in this Explication,
I know it will be acceptable to you, and it is no
less than what I have endeavoured after. If
you espie many proofs under any Principle of
Religion, it is either because that the truths
there are more weighty, or that the cavils
against them are more than ordinary. If you
expected the Scriptures at large, the numero|sity
of them gives you the reason against that.
I had once some thoughts of illustrating the
mysterie of the Trinity of Persons, by some apt
Figure or Resemblance, and of placing it in
the Catechism; but for the avoiding of all oc|casion
of offence to the weak I have affixed it
here: And of all Figures, Keplers Circle
seems most artificial and correspondent with
this glorious mystery.


IN this Scheme or Figure you have a Cen|ter,
and a Circumference, and an Inter
space, and yet but one Circle: So that there
are three Persons, and yet but one God. These
three are not divided; For it is not a Center,
or Interspace, separate from the Circumfe|rence:
But these are distinguished in their
incommunicable properties in their order, and
in their operation (upon a supposition of mo|tion)
The Center is the beginning (as is easie
to be observed in drawing the Circle) the
Circumference is a resultance from the Center
alone, the Interspace from the Center and
the Circumference.
These are Co-equal; the Center and the Cir|cumference,
and the Interspace are equidistant
every where, each one from other: And
the Center is no more a Circle without a Cir|cumference,
than the Circumference and In|terspace
without a Center.
Consubstantial; The Center is constituent
of the Circle, not a part from but together
with the Circumference and the Interspace.
Co-eternal; It is no Center without a
Circumference; and no sooner is the Circum|ference
drawn, but you find the Interspace.
Doubtless there is Vnity in Trinity in all
things, had we but light and eyes to espy it.
You will find annexed to the Explication
a Discause out of Acts 8 30. where you
will meet with some Rules (which have ob|tained
in Divinity) for your better under|standing,
and more profitable reading the holy
Scriptures: If you be of that select numbr
that cannot content your selves with bare
reading, but labour to understand what you
read; they are chiefly and more especially
designed for you. And that you may under|stand
what you read, and remark in your
course of reading the Sacred Scriptures,
those truths more distinctly which will make
you wise to Salvation, is the main purprt
and intent of this little piece, and intense
desire of its Compser,
Your Friend
for Eternity.

Q. What is Mans chief happiness?
A. To enjoy God for everPsa. 73. 24, 25, 26..
Q. How doth Man enjoy God?
A. Two waies 1. Here in this life, by
an holy Communion with him in the Duties
of his Worship,1 Joh. 1. 3. and in an upright Conver|sation
Ps. 50. 23. and 25. 14. 2. Hereafter in the life to come,
in a glorious and immediate Communion
with him in his Kingdom1 Cor. 13. 12. Luk. 13. 28..
Q. May a man have another subordi|nate,
or less principal end, besides the
glorifying of God, and enjoying him for
ever?
A. Yes1 Thes. 4. 11, 12. 1 Tim. 5. 8. Prov. 30. 8. Ps. 144. 15. Prov. 3. 8. Deu. 12. 19. and 14. 27, 29. with Mal. 3. 8..

him for ever mans subordinate
end, or else his ultimate and chief end?
A. Mans chief end.
Q. Why are the glorifying of God,
and the enjoying him for ever joyned as

A. Because God hath inseparably joyned
them together, so that men cannot truly de|sign,
or seek the one without the otherDeut. 30. 19, 20. Isa. 55. 3. with Joh. 17. 3..
Q. What Rule hath God given to di|rect
us how we may glorifie and enjoy
him?
A. The Word of God which is contained
in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testa|ment,
is the only way to direct us how we
may glorifie and enjoy him.
Explic. Q. What direction must we
follow that we may aright glorifie God,
and enjoy him for ever?
A. We must follow the Rule God hath
given us.
Q. What Rule is that?
A. The Word of GodPsal. 119. 16, 17. Neh. 8. 8. 2 Tim. 4. 2. Act. 11. 19. 2 Pet. 1. 18, 19. and 1. 1. 25. Mat. 7. 13. Act 13. 44. 1 Joh. 1. 3..
Q Why is the Word of God called
our Rule?
A. Because all Doctrines which we are
bound to believe, must be measured or judged
of; and all duties which we are bound to
practise, must be squared or conformed unto
this RuleGal. 6. 16..
Q. Where is the Word of God con|tained?
A. It is contained in the Books of the
Old and New TestamentEph. 2. 20..
Q. How are these Books called?
A. They are called the holy Scriptures2 Tim. 3. 15..
Q. Why are these Books so called?
A. Because they were written by Pen-men
inspired by God infallibly to that end.
Q. How do you know that the Books
of the Old and New Testament are the
Word?
A. The Papists grant the Protestants, that
all the Books which they receive are the cer|tain
Word of God.
Q. But how will you convince an In|fidel,
that the Doctrine taught in these
Books is the certain Word of God?
A. The Testimony of the Church is of
great weight and importance in this matter.

By the Church we understand the whole com|pany
of Believers, who have professed the
true Faith; whether those who received the
Doctrine of the holy Scriptures from the Pro|phets
and Apostles, or those who lived after:
whose Testimony
1. Is profitable to prepare the heart, and
to move it to believe.
2. And of all humane Testimonies (where|by
the Author of any Book that hath, is,
or shall be extant, can be proved) the greatest,
both in respect of the multitude, wisdom,
honesty, faithfulness of the witnesses; and
the likeness, constancy, and continuance of
the Testimony it self.
3. But this Testimony is only humane.
4. Not the only, nor the chief whereby
the Truth and Divinity of this Doctrine is
confirmed.
5. Neither can it be the ground of Divine
Faith and Assurance. And therefore besides
this Testimony,
There are four other several infallible
Testimonies of Gods Spirit, which (though
each of them alone is convincing, yet) all
together make up that full evidence that will
be Ground of Divine Faith and Assurance
to an Infidel.
Q. Which are those four witnesses?
A. They are, 1. Antecedently The Spirit
of Prophecie, foretelling things to come so long
before.
2. Constitutively, or inherently, The Image
of God that unimitable character of Divini|ty
which animates this Doctrine.
3. Concomitantly, The multitude of evi|dent
and uncontrolled Miracles wrought for
this very end to confirm it. And
4. Subsequently, The extraordinary suc|cess
it hath in the world, which will convince
a very Infidel that it is the very Word of
God.
Q. What is the first witness of the
Spirit?
A. 1. Antecedently, The Spirit of Pro|phecy.
Q What mean you by that?
A. A continuance of wonderful Prophe|cies,
foretelling things to come, so long be|fore,Gen. 3. 15. and 12. 3. and 49. 10. Dan. 9. 24. marked with their circumstances;
not doubtful, like the Oracles of the Hea|then,
or Merlins Prophecies, but such as ex|pressed
the things and Persons by their
Names2 Kings 13. 2. with 23 16. Isa. 45. 1. Jer. 25. 12. and 29. 10. with Ezr. 1., which had all in their times their
certain performance; and therefore unto what
can we attribute these infallible Predictions
but to the inspiration of God?
Q. What is the second witness of the
Spirit?
A. 2. Constitutively, or inherently The
Image and superscription of God, (as Coin
is known by the Image and superscription it
beareth) or that unimitable character of
Divinity not only imprinted on it, but in|trinsecally
animating and constituting it.
Q. Wherein is the Image and super|scription
of God, or that unimitable
character of Divinity which animates and
constitutes this Doctrine, apparent?
A. It is apparent in the matter, and the
method, and the stile.
Q. How is the Image of God appa|rent
in the matter?
A. 1. As this Doctrine contains superna|tural
verities, such Divine and wonderful
Truths as could never enter into the heart of
man to conceive them, and the things the
very Angels desire to look into1 Per. 1. 12..
Q. Declare this by some particular In|stances.
A. It explicates unto us the Nature, Pro|perties
and high Acts of God, purely and
holily.
2. It describes the Person of Christ, so
fitly, excellently, and conveniently, that if
the mind of man consider it attentively, it
must acknowledge, it doth exceed the
reach of a finite understanding.
3. It discovers to us the corruption and
misery of man by nature, the incomprehensi|ble
Love of God in Iesus Christ towards
man, that happy reconciliation (if we may
so speak) of his Iustice and Mercy by his
infinite wisdom, ordaining Iesus Christ to be
our Mediator.
4. It unfolds the Covenant of Grace,
which God made with man after his fall;
all which can be drawn from no Fountain
but Divine Revelation1 Cor. 2. 7, 10. Eph. 3. 4, 5. Col. 1. 25, 26..
5. It teacheth also the whole Duty of
Man, having Statutes and Iudgements in|comparably
wise and good, the Gentiles
themselves being IudgesDeut. 4. 5, 6, 7, 8..
Q. How is the Image of God appa|rent
in the Method?
A. 2. As the Method of the whole Do|ctrine
of the holy Scriptures set together, is
the most admirable and perfect in the world;
beginning with God in unity of essence, pro|ceeding
to his Trinity of essential active
Principles, and of Persons, and so to his
Trinity of works, Creation, Redemption
and Regeneration, great things past finding
out, and wonders without number; and all
chiefly with special relation to mankind;
both in the estate of Innnocency and Apo|stasie.
Q. And how is the Image of
God apparent in the stile of this Do|ctrine?
A. 3. As it is spiritual, powerful and
divine; suited to holy ends, and to the
world of Persons to whom it is sent, who
are commonly ignorant and unlearned, and
so more generally useful than any other Do|ctrine
in the world: But withal containing
such weighty concerning truths and profound
mysteries, as will belong to the most learned,
and to them that are of full age, even those
who by reason of use, have their senses ex|ercised
to discern both good and evil, Rom.

with 26. 17, 18.
Q. What is the third Witness of the
Spirit?
A. 3. Concomitantly, The Multitude of
evident uncontrolled Miracles, wrought for

this very end to confirm itRom. 15. 18, 19. 1 Cor. 14. 18, 22. Acts 2. 42, 43. and 4. 30, 33. and 5. 12, 14. and 6. 7, 8. and 7. 36, 37, 38. and 8. 6, 12, 13, 14 and 13. 11, 12. and 14. 3. and 15. 12 and 19. 10, 11. Mark 16. 17, 18, 20. with Heb. 2. 3, 4. (Miracles being
the effect of Gods own power, and the Seal
and Signet that may be set upon no other
Doctrine than that of the holy Scriptures)
will convince any that are not willfully blind
that these two Tales of Testimony, the holy
Scriptures of the Old and New Testament
(as those Tables of Stone) were written
with the finger of God, and were of divine
Authority.
Q. But the gift of Miracles is ceased?
A. Although it be; yet, 1. The History
of them is so certain from natural Princi|ples,
that its unpossible there should be any
deceit about them. And 2. There need not
be new Miracles to confirm the former, and
oblige men to believe them.
Q. Why so?
A. For then there must be mre Miracles
to confirm those; and so on to the end of the
world: and then God could not govern the
world by a settled Law, which  both ab|surd
and blasphemous.
Q. What therefore is the fourth Witness?
A. 4. Subsequently, The success of the
Doctrine of the holy Scriptures, to the Re|generation
of a great part of the world, is a
surviving witness to the end of the world of
its divine AuthorityAct. 2. 41. and 4. 4. with Matth. 28. 19, 20..
Q. Of what use is this Testimony?
A. Of great use.
Q. Why so?
A. For he that is not able to examine
the History, which reports the Miracles to
him, may be able to find upon his Soul the
Image of God imprinted by the Gospel, and
to know that the Gospel hath that in it self,
which it imprints upon others; and that it
cometh from God, which leadeth men so di|rectly
to God. And it is certainly Gods own
means which he blesseth to so great and ex|cellent
ends.
Q Can we receive sufficient direction
from our own Wisdom, or the Light
of Nature to come to glorifie and enjoy
God?
A. NoRom. 1. 21..
Q. Can we receive sufficient direction
from Gods works of Creation and Pro|vidence?
A. NoHeb. 11. 3. Psal. 19. 1, 7. and 73 2, 3, 12,18. and 36. 5, 6..
Q. Are not the Apocryphal Books
Scripture, nor any other, but the Books
of the Old and New Testament?
A. No.
Q. Are not the Traditions of the
Church to be received, with equal reve|rence
to the holy Scriptures?
A. NoPsal. 119. 98. 99, 100. Act. 24. 14..
Q Must we call no man Father, or
Master upon the Earth?
A. No, for one is our Father which is in
Heaven, and one is our Master even Christ.
And all Christians being taught of God by
Christ are appointed to acknowledge no Fa|ther,
or Master upon the EarthJoh. 13. 13. Matth. 23. 9, 10..
Q. Is there not an infallible Judge of
Controversies upon the Earth?
A. Christ, and none else, hath Athori|ty
to give Laws unto us, and punish the re|fractory;
And it is not for any Man living
upon the Earth to impose Observances where
Christ hath given libertyJam. 4. 12..
Q. What would you say to such as
should require you to follow the Judge|ment
of Fathers, Councils, and learned
Divines, when you find it not agreeable to
Scripture?
A. To the Law, and to the Testimony:
if they speak not according to this Word,
it is because there is no light in them, Isa.
8. 20.
Q. Is the Scripture plain enough to be
understood, even by the simple?
A. Yes, Psal. 19. 7. and 119. 130.
Q. Is the Word of God a dead letter
of it self?
A. No, Heb. 4. 12. Joh. 6. 63.
Q. But do the things recorded in the
Word of God concern us all?
A. Yes, Rom. 15. 1,5. Matth.
7. 24.
Q. Is there any other Rule besides
the holy Scriptures, to direct us how we
may glorifie God and enjoy him?
A. No.
Q. How prove you that?
A. 1. Because God never gave any other,
Rev. 22. 18. For I testifie unto every man
that heareth the words of the Prophecy of
this Book, if any man shall add unto these
things, God shall add unto him the Plagues
that are written in this Book.
Q. What is the Form of speech here
used to conclude this Book?
A. It is 1. A Symbolical and Prophetical
Form of expressing the certainty and immuta|bility
of this Prophecie; and secondly an
expression of the Absoluteness and perfection
of it is order to publick use, that it should
be the only Prophecie given to the Christian
Church, which should bring divine authority
along with it, sent with a Commission from
Heaven; and not only proceeding from a pub|lick
Spirit, but sent out with a publick Charge.
Q. What is that publick Charge?
A. As for all those to whom this Prophecy
shall come, I adjure them all that they nei|ther
add nor diminish, nor change a tittle of
it, upon pain of Gods bringing on them the
Iudgements that are here denouned against
Gods greatest enemies; and withal that they
look upon it as the last Authoritative Proph|cie
that is likely to come from Heaven, to be
a Rule of Faith to the ChurchRev. 22. 18, 19..
Q. What other reason have you to
prove that the holy Scriptures are the only
Rule to direct us how we may glorifie
God and enjoy him?
A. Because they are only able per|fectly
and without errour to direct us how we
ought so to doPsal. 19. 7. Joh. 5. 39. with 17. 3. 17. 2 Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17. Psal. 119. 96 Joh. 20 31..
Q. 3. What do the Scriptures princi|pally
teach?
A. The Scriptures principally teach, what
man is to believe concerning God, and what
Duty God requires of man.
Explica. Q. What are the principal
Heads of the Doctrine of the holy Scrip|tures?
A. The Doctrines that the holy Scriptures
teach may be ranked into two Heads.
Q. What is the first principal Doctrine
taught therein?
A. What man is to believe concerning God.
Q What is it o beliee?
A. To assent, or give credit to truths upon
Authority of anotherJoh. 4. 39, 41, 42..
Q. What is the second?
A. What duty God requires of man2 Tim. 1. 13..
Q. What is meant by the duty which
God requireth of man?
A. That which is Gods due, or that which
we owe to God, and are bound to do as we
are his Creatures, Subjects andLuke 17. 10. Chil|dren.
Q D the Scriptures teach us all
matters of Faith, or all that we are bound
to believe?
A. YesActs 20. 27. and 24. 14..
Q. And all matters of practice, or
whatsoever we are bound to do?
A. YesDeut. 12. 32. Rev. 22. 18..
Q. Is not a Christian then bound to
believe any thing as a point of Faith, but
what is taught in the holy Scriptures?
A. NoGal. 1. 9.
Q Nor bound to do any thing as ne|cessary
to Salvation, but what is taught
in them?
A. NoMat. 15. 9..
Q. 4. What is God?
A. God is a Spirit, infinite, eternal
and unchangeable in his Being, Wisdom,

Power, holiness, justice, goodness and
Truth.
Explic. Q What are we to believe
concerning God?
A. We are to believe concerning his Be|ing
and nature, that he is a Substance and
a Spirit; or that he is a spiritual Sub|stance
Ex. 3. 14. Joh. 4. 24..
Q. Why is God called a Spirit?
A. 1. Negatively, because he hath no
bodily SubstanceLuk. 24. 39..
2. Affirmatively and positively, because
he is a pure active life, intelligence and
will.
Q. Are not Angels, and the Souls
of men Spirits?
A. YesHeb. 1. 13, 14. Eccl. 12. 7..
Q. How then is God distinguished
from Angels, and the souls of men?
A. God is an infiniteJob 11. 7, 8, 9. Psal. 139. 7,14., eternalPs. 90. 2.,
and unchangeablePsa. 102. 27. Mal. 3. 6. Jam. 1. 17. Spirit. Angels and
the Souls of men are finite SpiritsJob 4. 18, 19. Heb. 1. 10. Job 8. 9. Psal. 102. 25, 26., bu
of yesterday and changeable.
Q. But since Angels as well as the
Souls of men are finite, how are they to
be distinguished?
A. Angels are pure Spirits, and have no
commerce or society with Bodies, which the
Souls of men have, being in the most inti|mate

conjunction with them. And though in
the separate state they do subsist and live with|out
them; yet because their happiness or
misery is not compleat without them, the
souls of the Iust already made perfect in ho|liness,
will be carried out with strong incli|nations
unto and earnest expectation of re|union
with their Bodies, to be together made
perfect in happiness, in good measure pressed
down and shaken together and running over:
And in the souls of the unjust, there shall
be a fearful expectation of reunion with
their Bodies as of a certain approaching, un|avoidable
and utterly undoing evil, to fill
up the measure of their misery, suffering
together the vengeance of eternal fire.
Or more briefly, God, Angels and the
souls of men may be thus distinguished.
Angels are created Spirits compleat. As
Angels are created Spirits, they are distin|guished
from God, who is a Spirit uncreate,
or the Creator of all, or the God of the Spi|rits
of all flesh. As Spirits compleat, they
are distinguished from the souls of men
which in their compleat subsistence require
Bodies, which Angels do not,Aug. En|chir. c. 18. and may there|fore
be called Persons, or compleat subsistences.
Q. What else are we to believe con|cerning
God?
A. We are to believe concerning his at|tributes
that they are of two sorts; 1. In|communicable.
2. Communicable.
Q. What and which are his Incommu|nicable
attributes?
A. His Incommunicable attributes are
such as are not partaken of by the Creatures,
[or that cannot be communicated to them]
such are these, his Infiniteness, Eternity
and Vnchangeableness.
Q. What is it to be Infinite?
A. To be without end, bounds or limits.
Q. What is it to be Eternal?
A. To be without beginning, or successi|on,
or end of time.
Q. What is it to be unchangeable?
A. To be alwaies the same without any
alteration.
Q. What and which are the Communi|cable
attributes of God?
A. His Communicable attributes are such
as in a measure are partaken of by the crea|tures
[or may be communicated to them]
such are these, his Wisdom, Power, Holi|ness,
Iustice, Goodness and Truth.
Q. But are they in the same manner in
the Creatures as in God?
A. No.
Q. After what manner are they in

the Creatures, and how are they in God?
A. God is Ininite, Eternal and unchange|able
in them, and the Creatures are not.
Q. May then Gods Incommunicable
Attributes be applied to and spoken of
the Communicable?
A. Yes, they may.
Q. How is God said to be Infinite,
Eternal and Unchangeable?
A. 1. In his WisdomPs. 147. 5 Rom. 16. 7..
Q. What is the Wisdom of God?
A. The Wisdom of God, is his Essential
property, whereby by one simple and eternal
Act, he knoweth both himself and whatso|ever
is possible to be known.
Q. How else is God said to be Infinite,
Eternal and Unchangeable?
A. In his Power1 Tim. 6. 15., and HolinessRev. 4. 8 and 15. 4 1 Sam. 2. 2. Job 6. 10. Ps. 71. 22. Prov. 9. 10..
Q What is the power of God?
A. It is his Essential property, whereby
he can do all things.
Q. What is the holiness of God?
A. It is his Essential property, whereby
he is infinitely pure and holy in himself, de|lighteth
in his own purity, and loveth the
resemblances of it in his Creatures.
Q. What doth your Catechism last of
all mention God to be Infinite, Eternal,
and Unchangeable in?
A. In his IusticePsa. 7. 9., GoodnessPsa. 119. 68., and
TruthExod. 34. 6..
Q. What is the Justice of God?
A. The Iustice of God is his Essential
Property, whereby he is infinitely righteous
in himself, and equal in all his waies and
dealings with his Creatures.
Q. What is the goodness of God?
A. It is his Essential property, whereby
he is altogether good in himself, and the
Author of all good.
Q. What is the Truth of God?
A. It is his Essential property, whereby
he agreeth with himself, Truth with Truth;
and is so immutably faithful in respect of
his Creatures, that it is not possible for
him to lie, or deceive any of themHeb. 6. 18. and 10. 23. with 3. 11. and Zach. 1. 6..
Q 5. Are there more Gods than
one?
A. There is but one only, the living and
true God.
Explic. Q. Doth the Scripture menti|on
no more Gods than one?
A. Yes, diverse so called in Scripture,
1. AngelsPsal. 8. 5. wih Heb. 2. 7. Psal. 86. 8. and 138 1. and 97. 7., 2. MagistratesEx. 22. 28. Psal. 82. 1, 2, 6, 7. Joh. 10. 34, 35, 36., 3. Satan
and satanical Apparitions2 Cor. 4. 4. 1 Sam. 28. 13., 4. The BellyPhi. 3. 19.,
5. IdolsPsa. 96. 5. Ex. 12. 12. 2 Chro. 7. 19. and 32. 13..
Q. How then is God differenced from
these?
A. Our Catechism gives three differences
between them in the Titles it gives to God,
the God of Heaven.
Q. Which is the first Title given
him?
A. God is one only in opposition to many
GodsDeu. 6. 4. 1 Cor. 8. 5, 6..
Q. How may it be proved that there
is but one God?
A. There can be but one Infinite, Eter|nal
and Vnchangeable Being.
Q. What Titles else hath the God of
Heaven given him here?
A. He is, and he is said to be the living
and the true GodDeut. 10. 10..
Q. How is God said to be the living
God?
A. Two waies, 1. In opposition to dead
IdolsPsal. 115. 4, 5, 6, 7. Hab. 2. 19. 1 Thes. 2. 9.. 2. In that he hath his life from him|self.
and gives life to all other thingsJer. 4. 2. Deu. 32. 40. with Heb. 6. 13. and Rev. 10. 5, 6. Acts 17. 25, 28..
Q. But the Creatures are, and are said
to be living also.
A. True, but not as God is living; they
have not their life from themselves, nor do
they give life to other things, as God hath
and doth.
Q. How is God said to be the true
God?
A. Because he is God really and indeed,

not by way of imagination as Idols are, but
by nature he is soGal. 4. 8..
Q. How doth it appear that God is
true, that he hath a true being, or that
there is a God indeed? Or how may it be
proved that there is a God?
A. It may be proved that there is a God,
by the Testimony of Conscience, and by the
Word of God.
Q. How is Conscience a witness of
this first Truth?
A. 1. As it excuses and comforts in well-doing
against the disgraces, slanders and
Persecutions of the world; and as it accuses
and terrifies for sin secretly committed,
which never did, nor shall come into the
knowledge of men: Acting both these
waies with respect to an higher Tribunal,
where the supream Iudge will avenge the
righteous and vindicate their Cause, and
punish the wicked, condemning them to shame
and everlasting contemptRom. 2. 15. Gen. 4. 7, 13. with Eccl. 9. 7. and Matth. 27. 4, 5. Acts 5. 41. and 16. 25. with 24 25. Rom. 2. 5,13..
Q. How is it proved by the Word of
God, that there is a God?
A. 2. As the Word of God makes mani|fest
the secrets of the heart, and without
excellency of speech, or of wisdom, under
plainness and easiness of stile becomes the
power of God to Salvation.
Q. How doth the Word manifesting
the secrets of the heart and becoming the
power of God to Salvation, prove that
there is a God?
A. Because these are the Works which
none but the All-seeing1 Cor. 14. 24, 25. with 2 Kings 6. 11, 12. Rom. 8. 27. Psal. 7. 9., and AlmightyRom. 1. 16. with Eph. 1. 19, 20, 21. Joh. 10. 37, 38.
God ever did, or can do.
Q. But who ever saw God, that every
one is thus confident to affirm that there
is a God?
A. 1. Men may without suspicion of
rashness and unadvised confidence affirm
that there are many things which no man
ever saw or can see; for no man ever saw
the wind or the air, and yet all are confi|dent
that there are both: Ad who ever
saw his own face but in a glass, and ne|ver
out of a glass, and yet this contenteth
him. But,
2. We are not without the sight of God;
For,
1. God is seen in his worksRom. 1. 20..
2. The Fathers have seen him by sundry
visions; and Moses saw the similitude of
the Lord, or his back parts: but his face
can no man see. It pleased God to appear
to them of old not as he is, but as he vouch|safed
to manifest himself to them: For if
they had seen him as he is, then all of them

had seen him after one manner because he is
one: And this sight of God was also ex|ternal.
3. It hath pleased him in more comforta|ble
manner to reveal himself to his Saints
by his Word, by which they behold his beauty
in his Temple, and with open face see his
Image as it is represented to them in the
mirror of the Gospel, and are transformed
into the same.
4. God is seen by inward contemplation,
and this sight is the more excellent than the
rest, because it is more inward.
5. He is seen by FaithHeb. 11. 27..
6. The Faithful have the clearest sight of
God in Heaven. Here their Faith is turned
into Vision, and their present sight of God,
if compared with that which is to come, is
not worthy the name of sight, 1 Cor. 13. 12.
7. God is to be seen in the face of Iesus
Christ, who is the brightness of his glory
and the express Image of his Person; And
that we might both know that God is, and
what he is, this only begotten Son of God
which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
declared himHeb. 1. 2, 3. Joh. 14. 8, 9. and 1. 18..
Q. 6. How many Persons are there in
the God-head?
A. There are three Persons in the God-head,

the Father, and the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, and these three are one God, the
same in substance, equal in power and glory.
Explic. Q What is meant by the God-head?
A. The divine nature, or essence.
Q. Is the divine nature common to all
three Persons?
A. The whole divine nature being indi|visible,
1 Cor. 8. 6. is common to all three
Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghst,
Acts 4. 24. 2 Cor. 1. 3. Joh. 1. 1.
Rom. 9. 5. Heb. 1. 8. Num. 12. 6, 7.
with Acts 1. 16. 1 Pet 1. 10, 11. Heb 1. 1.
Acts 4. 25 with 2 Pet. 1. 21.
Q. What followeth hence?
A. It followeth that whatsoever doth
absolutely agree to the divine nature, or is
spoken of the divine nature by relation unto
the Creatures, that doth agree likewise to
every Person in Trinity, Joh. 1. 1. Prov. 8. 22.
Rev. 1. 8. Matth. 18. 20. Joh. 3. 13.
Job 26. 13. and 33. 4. Joh. 14. 26.
Luke 1. 35.
Q. Is there any Scripture-proof for
Persons in the God-head?
A. There is, Heb. 1. 3. who being the
brightness of his Fathers Glory, and the
express Image of his person.
Q. Which are the three persons in the
God-head?
A. The Father, and the Son, and the
Holy GhostMat. 28. 19. 2 Cor. 13. 14..
Q. What is a Person in the God-head?
A. A Person in the God-head, is the
God-head restrained, or distinguished by his
personal or incommunicable prperty.
Q. What is the incommunicable [or
personal] property of the Father?
A. To begetHeb. 1. 5..
Q. What is the personal property of
the Son?
A. To be begottenJoh 1. 14, 18..
Q What is the personal property of
the Holy Ghost?
A. To proceed both from the Father and
the SonJh. 14. 16, 17. and 15. 26..
Q. How do the persons of the Trini|ty
differ one from another?
A. They differ three waies: 1. In their
incommunicable properties, as before ex|plained.
2. In their order; The Father
is the first Person in order; the Son as he is
the Mediator between God and men1 Tim. 2. 5., or
the Daies-man that can lay his hand on us
bothJob 9. 33., the second in order; and the Holy
Ghost the third person.
Hence1 Cor. 8. 6. Creation is properly attributed
to the Father, because things take their ori|ginal
from him;Rom. 3. 24. Col. 1. 13, 14. 1 Tim. 2. 5, 6. Redemption to the Son,
because he was made Man for us, and be|came
our Redeemer; Sanctification inchoate
and consummate to the Holy Ghost, because
he begins and perfects the work of grace in
the Elect of God.Joh. 3 5. 1 Co. 6. 11. and 12. 11. 2 Thes. 2. 13. 3. In their operation.
And look what order there is in the existing
in the Trinity, the same order there is in
working, viz. the Father is of noneIsa. 44. 6, 7.;
the Son is of the Father aloneJoh. 13. 3.; the Holy
Ghost is of the Father and of the SonJoh. 14. 16, 17. and 15. 26. Rom. 8. 9.:
In like manner, the Father works of him|self
by the Son and the Holy Ghost1 Cor. 8. 6, Heb. 1. 2. Joh. 1. 2, 3. Gen. 1. 2. Job 26. 13.; the
Son from the Father alone by the Holy
GhostGen. 19. 24. Joh. 5. 17, 23. and 16. 13, 14, 15. Matth. 12. 28.; the Holy Ghost from the Father
and the Son by himselfJoh. 14. 16, 17. and 15. 26. 1 Cor. 12. 11.. In externals,
although in respect of the things wrought,
they are common to all the Persons; yet in
respect of the manner of working, there is
distinction of the Persons.
Q. If the Father be God, and the Son
God, and the Holy Ghost God; why
then are there not three Gods, but one
God?
A Because they are the same in sub|stance
1 Joh. 5. 7. equal in power andJoh. 10. 30. Phil. 2. 6. Acts 5. 3, 4. and Mat. 1. 20. Luk. 1. 32, 35. with Mark 5. 7. Psal. 18. 13. and 29. 3. glory.
Q. 7. What are the Decrees of God?
A. The Decrees of Gd are his eternal
purpose according to the Counsel of his
will, whereby for his own glory, he hath
fore-rdained whatsoever comes to pass.
Explic. Q What is it for God to De|cree?
A. To appoint and determine, to purpose
and fore-ordain.
Q. What hath God fore-ordained in
his Decrees?
A. Whatsoever comes to pass.
Q. When were things thus fore-or|dained?
A. In Gods eternal purpose.
Q. What was the Rule of this?
A. The counsel of his own WillEph 1. 11..
Q. To what end hath God fore-or|dained
whatsoever comes to pass?
A. For his own GloryEph. 1. 12..
Q. 8. How doth God execute his De|crees?
A. God executeth his Decrees in the

Works of Creation and Providence.
Explic. Q. Are the works of Creati|on
and Providence the Execution of
Gods eternal Decrees?
A. YesRev. 4. 11. Dan. 4 35, 37..
Q. What do you mean by the execu|tion
of Gods eternal Decrees?
A. The bringing to pass whatsoever God
hath fore-ordained.
Q. How do the Decrees of God, and
the execution of them differ?
A. The Decrees of God are from all eter|nity,
the execution of them in time.
Q. 9. What is the work of Creation?
A. The work of Creation is God's
making all things of nothing, by the Word
of his power, in the space of six daies,
and all very good.
Explic. Q Whose work is the work
of Creation?
A. Gods workGen. 1. 1..
Q. What did God make in the Crea|tion?
A. All things.
Q. Of what did he make them?
A. Of nothing, or of unapt matter.
Q. What is it then to Create?
A. To make a thing of nothing, or of
matter unapt to be brought into perfect

Form by any power of second Causes.
Q. By what were all things made?
A. By the Word of Gods powerHeb. 11. 3..
Q. When did God make all things?
A. InGen. 1. 1. time, not from EternityProv. 8. 22, 23..
Q. In what space of time did he make
them?
A. In the space ofExod. 20 11. six daies.
Q. But why did God take all this
time to make all things?
A. It was not, because he could not
have made them sooner in an instant, if it
had pleased him.
Q. For what special reasons then do
you imagine?
A. For these two especially, 1. That we
might learn by his example to work six
daies, and rest a seventh. 2. That we
might learn not to do things rashly and
hastily, but with due deliberation.
Q. Of what quality did God make all
things?
A. All very goodGen. 1. 31..

were in his loyns. And as Levi is said
to pay tithes in Abraham, when only in
his loyns, Heb. 7. 9, 10. so Adams Poste|rity
sinned in his loyns.

A. YesRom. 5. 12..

that estate whereinto man fell?

Righteousness, and the corruption of his
whole nature, which is commonly called
Original sin; together with all actual

Transgressions which proceed from it.
Expli. Q. How many sorts of sins be
there, wherein the sinfulness of that estate

Q. How do you prove the universal de|pravity
and corruption of mans nature?
A. Besides Scripture-proof, which is
as express in this truth as any upon Re|cord;

experience it self will confirm it
by our daily sinful infirmities, by our
backwardness to those duties wherein we
may enjoy most of God, and by our be|ing
Eftsoons led into temptation, and
drawn into those very sins which are
more especially cross and contrary to our
natural tempers and constitutions.
Q. But why is the corruption of mans
whole nature commonly called Original sin,
since that is not a Scripture name?
A. For three Reasons,
1. Because 'tis derived from Adam the
Original of mankindActs. 17. 26..
2. Because 'tis in every one from his
OriginalJob 14. 4. Psal. 51. 5.. It may say to every one, As
soon as thou wert, I am.
3. Because 'tis the original of all other
sinsJam. 1. 15..
Q. What do you mean by actual trans|gressions?
A. The transgressions of our Life,
which proceed from original sinEphes. 2 2, 3. Mat. 15. 19, 20..
Q. 19. What is the misery of that estate
whereinto man fell?
A. All mankind by their fall lost com|munion
with God, are under his wrath
and curse, and so made liable to all miseries
in this life, to death it self, and to the pains
of Hell for ever.
Explic. Q. What hath man lost by the
Fall?
A. Communion with God.
Q. What do you mean by that?
A. FellowshipCen. 3. 8, 24. or friendship with

Love, Grace and Favour.
Q. What is man brought under by the
Fall?
A. Under GodsEph. 2 3. wrath andGal. 3. 10. curse.
Q. What are the parts of Gods wrath
and Curse?
A. 1. All the miseries of this life.Lam. 3. 39. Gen. 47. 9. Job 5. 7.
2. Death it selfRom 6. 23, Death natural (here
meant) which is the separation of Body
and Soul.
3. The pains of Hell for everMat. 25. 41. Jude ver. 7. Rev. 20. 14, 15..
Q. 20. Did God leave all mankind to
perish in the estate of sin and misery?
A. God having out of his meer good
pleasure, from all Eternity elected some
to Eternal life, did enter into a Cove|nant
of Grace to deliver them out of the
estate of sin and misery, and to bring
them into an estate of Salvation by a Re|deemer.
Explic. Q. Must all mankind unavoidably
perish in their sins and misery?
A. No, not the elect of GodRom. 8. 33..
Q. Whom do you mean by Gods Elect?
A. Those whom God hath chosen to
everlasting life2 Thes. 2. 13..
Q. What moved God to Elect any?
A. His meer good pleasureEph 1. 5. Rom. 9. 18..
Q. What mean you by that?
A. The most free, absolute, or unde|termined
Will of God.
Q. When did God Elect them?
A. From all EternityEph. 1. 4..
Q. What mean you by that?
A. Before time began, or before any
thing was created.
Q. What did God do for his Elect, to ac|complish
his decree touching their Salva|tion?
A. He entred into a Covenant of Grace
with them.
Q. Why is the second Covenant called the
Covenant of Grace?
A. Because Free-grace was the only
motive God had to make, and perform
the Promises contained in itRom. 5. 15..
Q. By what other name is this Covenant
called?
A. It is also called the New Covenant,
because it never decayeth, nor waxeth
old; but remaineth in full force, effect and
vertue to the end of the worldJer. 31. 31..
Q. But what is become of the Law of
that first Covenant made with Adam in Pa|radise
Gen. 2. 17., that old Covenant, the Covenant
of Life, or Works; repeated to the IewsDeut. 27. 26.
The sum of which we have fully express'd,
Ezek. 18. 4. The Soul that sinneth, it shall
die?
A. It is neither executed nor abro|gated;
but released, or dispensed with.
Q. Is it not fully executed?
A. NoRom. 8. 1..
Q. Nor abrogated?
A. No.
Q. How prove you that?
A. By these two Reasons,
1. It is in part executed upon Believers
themselves; they are liable to the mise|ries
of this lifePs. 34. 19. 1 Cor. 15. 19. Psal. 89. 30, 31, 32, 33., and to Death it self,
viz. to the first or natural DeathRom. 6. 23., which
is the wages of sin, although the second
Death hath no power over themRev. 20. 6..
2. It is totally executed upon finally
impenitent unbelievers; who are liable
to the pains of Hell for ever2 Thes. 1. 8, 9., over
whom not the first only, but the second
Dath also hath powerJoh. 3. 18. 36. Rev. 20. 14, 15..
Q. But seeing Iesus tasted Death for
every man, doth not the Gospel relieve im|penitent
unbelievers?
A, The Gospel finds them, and every
one in a state of Condemnation: Those
who believe, it proclaims deliverance unto
and relieves them; but those who through
unbelief reject it, andActs 13. 46. put it from them,
and judge themselves unworthy of ever|lasting
life, it leaves such as it found
them, viz. under the Condemnation of
the Old Covenant, since they refuse the
pardoning mercy of the New.
Q. You have now satisfied us that the
first Covenant is neither fully executed nor
abrogated; But how is it released, or dis|penced
with?
A. By super-inducing a New Cove|nant
of Grace over it; that whosoever
closeth with, and comes into the terms
of the new, shall be exempted from the
rigour and extremity, i. e. from the eter|nal
Joh. 3. 16 condemnation of the old; although
he may be liable to the miseries of this
life, and to the first Death.
Q Is the Covenant of works, as to its
execution upon such as are in the Covenant
of Grace, in the chief part restrained, al|though
in some part inflicted?
A. Yes.
Q. In the chief part restrained, and in
some part inflicted; what do you mean by
that?
A. We mean, that Believers shall never
complain under the eternal and destru|ctive,
although they do bear the tempo|ral,
and corrective punishment of their
finsLam. 3. 33.
Q. But because generals are obscure, tell
us particularly, for the clearer understand|ing
of this Mysterie, what obligation the
first Covenant laies on sinful man?
A. A double obligation; first, in re|ference
to what is past. And secondly,
in reference to the future.
Q What obligation doth it lay on him,
in reference to what is past?
A. It requires satisfaction, and repa|ration
from him, for his sin in break|ing
itRo. 6. 23..
Q What, in reference to the future?
A. It requires perfect conformity still
as at the first, and absolute obedience to
all Gods commands, being the eternal
debt of the reasonable creature to
that God, that made it in his own Image.
Q. Is it possible for us to satisfie Gods in|jured
Law for our first breach?
A. No.
Q But if we could, might not the Law
come upon us for future exact conformi|ty,
to pay the residue of that eternal

Debt, due to God as our Creator?
A. YesJoh. 5. 14, it might.
Q. Doth the Covenant of Grace relieve
us as to both these cases, and dispence with
the rigour of the Law?
A. Yes.
Q. How doth it relieve us as to the first
obligation?
A. It comforts us with the good news
that the Son of God hath satisfied his Fa|thers
Justice; and if we believe but in
him, God will accept of us, as if we had
satisfied in our own persons. [The case the
Law leaves us in, is well expressed,
Isa. 33. 14. and Heb. 10. 31. But the
relief the Gospel brings us, in St. Paul's
language, Rom. 8. 33, 34. you have both
together excellently, Ezek. 33. 10, 11.]
Q. How, as to the second?
A. The New Covenant dispenceth
with the rigour of that too; and justified
and pardoned persons shall not lose all
again upon the least defailance; therefore
the Gospel proclaims pardon of sin upon
Repentance, and acceptance of sincere en|deavours
to obey him.
Q God gave the Law from Mount Sinai,
and the voice of words was so dreadful
there, that they which heard it, intreated

that the Word should not be spoken to them
ny more: But we are come to Mount
Sion; what is Gods language to us now?
A. Sinners, be but in good earnest, do
but love me heartily and my waies; let
me but see a child-like ingenuity in you,
and I will put down your upright, though
imperfect performances, in the Book of
my remembranceMal. 3. 16..
Q. How is it possible our performances
should be recorded in the Book of Gods re|membrance,
since the best of them are im|perfect,
and we do daily break the Com|mandments
of God in thought, word and
deed?
A. If there be a willing mind, it is
well accepted according to that we have,
and not according to that we have not.
And the Commandments of God may be
reputed as done when whatsoever is not
done is pardoned. Thus doth the can|dour
of the Gospel dispence with the ri|gour
of the LawMat. 11. 30..
Q. But how doth it stand with Gods ve|racity
and immutability having once de|clared
that the soul that sinneth shall die,
to contradict it by declaring, That he that
believeth shall never die, but have Eternal
Life?Joh. 11. 26.
A. We must look upon threatenings as
a part of the Law, declaring the dueness
of the punishment, what the offender
hath deserved to suffer; Not as predicti|ons
of the event, any more than Thou
shalt, and Thou shalt not in the com|mand,
are Predictions: but only are ex|pressive
of the dueness of obedience.
Q. How do the Old and New Covenant
differ?
A. They differ more especially, these
two waies,
1. In their tenor; the tenor of the
Old is, Obey [perfectly] and live, sin
and die; The tenor of the New is, Be|lieve
on the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou
shalt be saved.
2. The New Covenant admits of Re|pentance,
which the Old doth not.
Q. But must not a believer acknowledge
perfect obedience to be still his duty?
A. Yes.
Q. Why so?
A. Because this honours the equity of
Gods Commandments.
Q. And hath the Redeemer then by
making this one of the Conditions of the
Gospel-Covenant, given his Father his Law
back again?
A. Yes.
Q. Doth he not repeal it?
A. No, it's still the Rule of life, and
every Commandment still obligeth a Be|liever.
Q. What hath Christ then done for us?
A. Christ hath only released us from
the condemning power of the Law, not
the commanding power of it.
Q. How understand you that?
A. We must still press after perfecti|on;
but though we fall short of it, we
shall not die for it: Christ having Re|deemed
us from the curse of the Law,
being made a curse for us; He leaves us
under the Government and Command of
the Law.
Q. But have you any Scripture-warrant
for what you say in this matter?
A. Yes, the whole matter is excellent|ly
expressed, 1 Ioh. 2. 1. My little Chil|dren,
these things write I unto you, that
you sin not: And if any man sin we have
an advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ
the righteous.
Q. But generally and more briefly, what
doth God promise to deliver the Elect out of
in the Covenant of Grace?
A. Out of the estate of sin and misery.
Q. But how doth God perform this Pro|mise
to them, seeing that they also are liable
to the miseries of this life, and to the first
Death as the wages of sin?
A. Although the Old Covenant in part
be executed on them, yet doth not God
leave them in the state of sin and misery;
but hath entred into a New Covenant
with them to bring them out of it:
And what they suffer is for their good,
that being reformed by stripes, they may
be freed from those punishments which
fall on the unreformed to all eternityLam. 3. 39. Mich. 7. 9. Rom. 5. 21. 15. 22. Rom. 8. 1, 2. 1 Cor. 11. 30, 32..
Q. And what doth God promise to
bring the Elect into in the Covenant of
Grace?
A. Into an estate of Salvation1 Joh. 5. 11, 12. Joh. 3. 16. Heb. 8. 10..
Q. Is then the Deliverance of Gods
Elect out of the estate of sin, and his
bringing them into an estate of Salvation,
the sum and the substance of what hath
been said more at large in several particu|lars
concerning the benefits of the New Co|venant?
A. Yes.
Q. How doth God promise to do all this?
A. By a Redeemer, Isa. 53. 10. When
thou shalt make his soul an offering for
sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong

his daies, and the pleasure of the Lord
shall prosper in his hand, vers. 11. He
shall see of the Travail of his soul, and shall be
satisfied, c. And this by some learned
Divines is called the Covenant of Re|demption.
Q. What do they mean by it?
A. That federal transaction that was
betwixt God the Father and the Son from
everlasting, about the Redemption of
lost and fallen Mn.
Q. Is not this the same with the Cove|nant
of Grace?
A. This Covenant is a Covenant of
Grace, but 'tis not strictly that Covenant
of Grace, which the Scripture holds out
in opposition to the Covenant of works;
but rather the means to it, or foundation
of it.
Q. Wherein do these two Covenants
differ?
A. In the Confederates, For in the
Covenant of Redemption, the Confede|rates
areJoh. 6. 37. God and Christ, but in the
Covenant of Grace, the Confederates are
God and BelieversJoh. 3. 16..
Q. 21. Who is the Redeemer of Gods
Elect?

Q. But is justifying Faith solitary with|out

A. No, justifying Faith hath two
Daughters that inseparably attend her.
1. Repentance: Here sinful man re|tracts
and undoes his faults, acknow|ledgeth
his transgressions, rents his heart
weeps, smites upon his breast, and cries
What have I done? laments after the
Lord, and abhors himself in dust and
ashes: He executes the Law upon him|self;
and since God excuseth him from
the punishment, he accuseth himself 

the guilt, and condemns himself to the
shame of his sin; and hereby the sinner
honours the equity of the threatning by
his tears, acknowledging that his blood
was due.
2. Newness of life: Here the sinner
acknowledgeth perfect obedience to be
still his duty, which honors the equity of
Gods CommandmentsRom. 16. 26.
Q. But that with all requisite distinctness
we may apprehend this great affair, let us
take a view of some of the most considerable
and important causes which concur to the
producing this excellent effect, the discharge
and Iustification of a sinner, and state their
several interests and concernments in their
respective influences upon and contributions
towards it, because Iustification is a main
Article of our Faith; and therefore, How
doth Free-grace Iustifie?
A. The Free-grace of God is the first
wheel that sets all the rest in motion.1. How free-grace Justifieth.
Its contribution is that of a Proegumenal
cause, or internal motive, disposing God
to send his Son, that sinners (believing)
might be Justified freely by his grace,
through the Redemption that is in Jesus
ChristJoh. 3. 16 Rom. 3. 24.
Q. But did not Christ die to render God
good to mankind?
A. Christ died not o render God
good to mankind (he was so eternally)
but that with the honour of his Justice he
might xert and display his goodness,
which contriv'd and made it self this way
to break forth into the world.
Q. How is Christs satisfaction concern'd
in our Iustification?
A. It is doubly concerned in it:2. How Christs sa|tisfaction.
1. In respect of God, as a Pro-catar|tick
cause (which is an external, as the
Progumenal is an internal moving cause)
and is of infinite merit and imperative
power; for the sake of which God is re|conciling
himself unto the world in Christ,
not imputing their Trespasses unto them,
2 Cor. 5. 19.
2. In respect of the Law of Works,
Christs satisfaction Justifieth us formally,
as our proper legal righteousness.
Q. Why do you call it our Righteous|ness?
A. Because it becomes imputed to us
upon our believing; Faith being our
Gospel-Title, by pleading which we
lay claim to all the benefits, accruing from
the merit of Christs performance, to all
effects, uses, and purposes, as if it had
been personally our own.
Q. But why do you call it our legal Righ|ness?
A. Because thereby the Law of God
owns it self fully apaid, and acquiesceth
 it, as in full reparations, and amends
ade unto it for the injury and dishonour
reived by the sin of man.
Q And may we plead this against
 the challenges and accusations of the
law.
A. YesRom. 8. 33, 34.
Q. And is this our legal Righteousness
required in the first Covenant, that of
Works, which is thus imputed upon our
account, wholly without us, in our Re|demer?
A. Yes2 Cor. 5. 21.
Q. But is our Evangelical Righteousness
required in the second Covenant without us,
as our legal Righteousness required in the
old is?
A. No, for though Christ performed
the Conditions of the Law, and satis|fied
for our non-performance, yet it is
our selves that must perform the conditi|ons
of the Gospel. It is not Christ but
we that must repent and believeActs 20. 21.
Q. But there are some that tell us that
Christ hath also performed for us the conditi|ons

of the Gospel; that he hath believed per|fectly,
and repented perfectly, and that all is
ours: what ought we to think of this Opi|nion?
A. If we judge of it in its clear con|sequence,
it is both absurd and blasphe|mous;
as if Christ had a Saviour to be|leve
in for pardon and life, or sin to re|pent
of, and sorrow for, and mortifie.
Q. How is this Opinion absurd?
A. As it supposeth a perfect Saviour
to stand in need of a SaviourHeb. 7. 26, 27.
Q. How is it blasphemous?
A. As it makes Christ the Son of God
a sinner, who is God and manJohn 9. 24, 25 Phil. 2. 6, 7 3 How the Gospel..
Q. How doth the Gospel Iustifie?
A. As it is the Law of Faith that
publisheth and declareth to us upon what
terms we shall be JustifiedRom. 3. 27.
Q. And is the Gospel our great Charter,
and Gods Wrrant under his broad Seal,
that he that believeth shall not be con|demned?
A. YesJoh. 3. 18.
Q. How doth Faith Iustifie?
A. By vertue of the Law promulgated
and publish'd as it is our Evangelical righ|teousness,4. How Faith.
or our keeping the Gospel-Law,
which suspends Justification upon be|lieving.
Q. Doth Faith pretend to no merit or
vertue of its own?
A. No, but professedly avows its de|pendance
upon the merit of Christs sa|tisfaction,
and laies hold on it as our le|gal
Righteousness.
Q. Nor can it shew any other Title to be
it self our Evangelical righteousness, but
only Gods sanction [Law, or Decree esta|blishing
it] who chose this Act of believing
to the honour of being the justifying Act, be|cause
it so highly honoureth Christ?
A. No.
Q. May this be illustrated to us by some
apt resemblance?
A. Yes, the Act of believing is as the
Slver; but Gods authority in the Gospel|sanction,
is the Kings Coin, or Image
stampt upon it, which gives it all its value
as to Justification.
Q. Without this stamp, could it never
have been current?
A. No.
Q. And if God had set this stamp on any
other Grace, as Love: would that then have
been current, and have Iustified us as Faith
doth now?
A. Yes.
Q. How doth God Iustifie?
A. God justifieth in a proper sense two
waies, First, as a Legislator. Secondly,5. How God.
as a Judge.
Q How doth God Iustifie as a Legislator?
A. He Justifies as a Legislator, enacting
by his Soveraign authority that sweet and
gracious Law of the New Covenant, by
vertue of whose tenor every sinner that
believes is Justified from the Guilt of sin,
from which he could not be Justified by
the Law of Moses, Acts 13. 39.
Q How doth God Iustifie as a Iudge?
A. 2. As a Judge, he may in three
respects be said to Justifie a Believer.
First, Forthwith upon his believing
God owneth him secretly within himself,
as a person justified; God esteems and
approves of him as in that state, unto
which he hath by believing a Title good
in Law, an indefeaible right.
Secondly, At the moment of dissoluti|on
God Justifieth as the Judge of all the
earth, passing a private Sentence and
a ward unto everlasting life upon every
believing Soul.
Thirdly, But eminently at the last day,
when the Ancient of daies shall take the
Throne, and in open Court before the
whole Creation, by publick sentence for

ever acquit and discharge Believers at
that great and last Assizes.
Q. How are works said to Iustiie?
A. 6. As they Justifie our Faith, or
demonstrate before God and man, and to
our own Consciences that our Faith is not
a dead and barren, but a true and living
one by its fruitfulness in well-doing.
Q. How doth the Spirit of God Iustifie?
A. 7. The Spirit of God Justifieth
two waies: First, Directly, by working
Faith in the heart, as the Author of that
justifying Grace. Secondly, Reflexively,
as he clears up Justification to a Believers
Conscience, by discovering the truth of
Faith by working Assurance, and by
sealing a Believer to the day of Redemp|tionRom. 8. 16, 17 Eph. 4. 30.

and by nature Children of wrath, into
his Family, and to receive them into the
number, and give them right unto all the
Priviledges of the Sons of GodEph. 2. 3, 19 2 Cor. 6. 18 Rom. 8. 17.

Q. Is this work done perfectly, and all
at once here upon earth?
A. No, we are enabled more and more
so to doJob 17. 9.
Q Wherein doth Sanctification differ
from Iustification and Adoption?
A. 1. Justification and Adoption are
acts of God without us: Sanctification
is a work of God within us.
2. Justification and Adoption do make
a relative change; Sanctification doth
make in us a real change.
Q But since Scripture calls Iustification
our righteousness as well as Sanctification,
why do you make them to differ?
A. 1. Justification is an imputed righ|teousness;
Sanctification is an inhe|rent.
2. Justification is a righteousness that
makes a change in the sinners state, where|by
he becomes absolved at the Bar of di|vine
JusticeRom. 8. 33, 34 (for Justification is a Law|state,
it abolisheth the convincing power
of sin, or its Guilt) but Sanctification is
a righteousness wrought in the sinners
person, whereby he becomes a new2 Cor. 5. 17
creature.
Q. 36. What are the benefits which in
this life do accompany or flow from Iustifica|tion,
Adoption, and Sanctification?
A. The benefits which in this life do
accompany or flow from Justification,
Adoption, and Sanctification are Assu|rance

of Gods Love, peace of Consci|ence,
joy in the Holy Ghost, increase of
Grace, and perseverance therein, to the
end.
Explic. Q How many sorts of benefits
are there which do belong to those which are
Iustified, Adopted and Sanctified?
A. There are three sorts,
1. Benefits in this life.
2. Benefits at death.
3. Benefits at their Resurrection.
Q. What benefits belong to them in this
life?
A. These five,
1. Assurance of Gods Love.
2. Peace of Conscience.
3. Joy in the Holy Ghost.
4. Increase of Grace.
5. Perseverance in Grace to the end.
Q What are the benefits which do ac|company
or flow from the sight and sense of
our Iustification, Adoption and Sanctifica|tion?
A. Assurance of Gods Love, peace of
Conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
Q. What mean you by the Assurance of
Gods Love?
A. Our knowing our selves to be in 
a justified estate. Or, the knowledge

of Gods unchangeable Love towards
usRom. 8. 38, 39.
Q. What by peace of Conscience?
A. That serenity of mind which
ariseth out of a true sense, and right ap|prehension
of the Love of God towards
us in1 Joh. 3. 21 Christ.
Q. What do you mean by joy in the Holy
Ghost?
A. The Spirit's bearing witness with
our spirit that we are the Children of
God, and that our names are written in
HeavenRom. 8. 16 Luke 10. 20.
Q Doth the Scripture warrant any di|stinction
between the Faith of Affiance and
the Faith of Evidence, or the assurance of
Gods Love?
A. That it is one thing to be Justified
(which is done by the Faith of Affiance)
and another thing to have it manifest to
our Consciences that we are so (which is
done by the Faith of Evidence) is very
clear from 1 Ioh. 5. 13. These things
have I written unto you that believe on the
name of the Son of God, that ye may
know that ye have Eternal Life.
Q Do the other benefits, increase of
Grace and Perseverance therein to the
end, accompany or slow from the Being

of Iustification, Adoption and Sanctifiation?
A. Yes.
Q. How may a Child of God get assu|rance,
[or a sure Evidence] of his Iusti|fication
and Adoption?
A. By his Sanctification.
Q. What is a sure Evidence of that?
A. Increase of GraceProv. 4. 18 John 15. 5.
Q. Do all truly Iustified and Adopted
persons increase in Grace?
A. 1. Negatively, they do not at all
times Actually increase in Grace; for
some of them may at some times be un|der
declinings and decaies of Grace.
2. Affirmatively, they are alwaies of
a growing disposition, and desirous to
grow in Grace, and at some time or
other they grow; And many times they
do grow when they do not perceive
themselves to grow, but fear that they
decline.
Q. Do all truly Iustified, Adopted, and
sanctified persons persevere in Grace to the
end?
A. They do persevere in Grace to the
end, and shall assuredly attain the hea|venly
Inheritance.
Q. How prove you that?
A. 1. From the unchangeableness of
Gods elective LoveRom. 8. 30 John 6. 37 Ro. 11. 29 John 13. 1.
2. From the All-sufficiency of his
PowerJohn 10. 28, 29, 30 1 Pet. 1. 5.
3. From his Faithfulness in his Pro|misesHeb 10 23 2 Cor. 1. 20 Nu~. 23. 19 Heb. 6. 17, 18 Isa. 54. 8, 9, 10  55. 3. 11.
4. From Christs unchangeable Priest|hood
and continual Intercession for
themHeb. 7. 24, 25 Joh. 11. 42.
5. From the nature of Grace, and the
means thereof1 Joh. 3. 9 1 Pet. 1. 9 and 3. 4 Hb. 6. 16 1 John 5. 4 Tit. 2. 11 1 Pet. 1. 23, 24, 25.
Q. May not any Believers by falling into
sin, fall from Grace?
A. Some Believers may through the
remainders of corruption in them, and
the violence of Satans temptations fall
into sin foully, and so fall from degrees
and measures of Grace; but they shall
never fall totally and finally from Grace.
And when we see any to fall totally and
finally from the profession they formerly
made, we may know they were never
that in sincerity, which they professed
themselves to be1 Joh. 2. 19.
Q. 37. What benefits do Believers re|ceive
from Christ at their Death?
A. The souls of Believers are at their
Death made perfect in holiness, and do
immediately pass into Glory; and their

Bodies being still united to Christ, do rest
in their Graves till the Resurrection.
Explic. Q. How manifold are the bene|fits
of Believers at their Death?
A. Twofold, 1. In respect of their
Souls.
2. In respect of their Bodies.
Q. 1. What benefits have Believers in
respect of their Souls at Death?
A. They are made perfect in holiness,
and do immediately pass into GloryHeb. 12. 23 2 Cor. 5. 1, 6.
Q. Are not Believers perfect in this life?
A. No1 Joh. 1. 8.
Q. Do not the Souls of Believers sleep in
the Grave with their Bodies, or stay in Pur|gatory?
A. No. Ibid.Phil. 1. 23 Luke 23. 42, 43.
Q What do Papists mean by Purgatory?
A. They mean a state of Temporary
punishments after this life, from which
men may be released and translated into
Heaven, by the Prayers of the living
and the Sacrifice of the Mass.
Q. 2. What benefits have Believers in
respect of their Bodies at Death?
A. 1. Their Bodies are still united to
Christ. For, though Death doth for a
while separate their Souls from their Bo|dies,
yet it cannot separate Christ from

either; but as when Christ died, his
Hypostatical or Personal union still re|mained,
his Divine Nature being united
both to his Soul in Heaven, and to his
Body in the Tomb on Earth: So when
Believers die, their mystical union unto
Christ still remaineth, and Christ is
united both to their Souls with him in
Glory, and to their Bodies, which are
his Members, even when they are rotting
in the GraveMat. 22 33 1 Cor. 6. 15.
2. They rest in their Graves, as in their
Beds, till the Resurrection1 Thes. 4. 14 Isa. 57. 2 1 Thes. 4. 16 Job 19. 25, 26, 27 Dan. 12, 2.
Q. What is the Resurrection here spoken
of?
A. The last and general Resurrection
of all the dead that have lived in all
Ages from the beginning of the Creation;
which will be first of the righteous, and
then of the wicked at the last day1 Thes. 4. 16 John 5. 28, 29.
Q How do you prove that there shall be
such a general Resurrection?
A. It may be undeniably proved from
the Scriptures and the power of God.
If God be of infinite power, and there|fore
can raise the dead, and infinitely true,
and in the Scriptures hath revealed that
he will raise all the dead, then there shall
be a general Resurrection; but God is

infinite in power, and in the Scriptures
hath revealed that he will raise all the
dead, therefore there shall be a general
Resurrection. The ground of the Sad|duces
errour, who denied the Resurrecti|on,
was their ignorance of these two
great foundations of this Doctrine, name|ly,
the Scriptures and the power of
GodMark 12. 24.
Q. Shall the Dead the raised with the
same body, which they had when aliu
before?
A. YesJob 19. 26, 27.
Q. How do you prove that the Dead shal
be raised with the same Body?
A. Because otherwise it could in no
proper sense be called a Resurrection, but
a new Creation.
2. Because 'tis fit the same Body that
was an instrument of righteousness, or sin
should share in the like Reward or
Punishment.
Q. Will not the Bodies, when they are
raised, differ from what they are now?
A. They will not differ from what
they are now in regard of their substance
and essence; But they will exceedingly
differ in regard of their qualities.
Q. 38. What benefits do Believer

receive from Christ at the Resurrection?
A. At the Resurrection, Believers be|ing
raised up in Glory, shall be openly
acknowledged and acquitted in the day
of Judgement, and made perfectly bles|sed
in full enjoying of God to all Eter|nity.
Explic. Q. How many waies may the
benefits which Believers receive from Christ
at the Resurrection be considered?
A. Three waies.
1. In respect of the Resurrection it
self.
2. In respect of the day of Judgement,
after their Resurrection.
3. In respect of Heaven after the day
of Judgement.
Q. What is the benefit of Believers in
respect of the Resurrection it self?
A. Believers shall be raised up in
Glory1 Cor. 5. 43 Phil. 3. 21.
Q. What benefits shall Believers have at
the day of Iudgement?
A. They shall be acknowledged and
acquitted.
Q. What mean you by their being ac|knowledged?
A. Their being owned by Jesus Christ
as hisMat. 10. 32.
Q. What mean you by their being ac|quitted,
and from what shall they be ac|quitted?
A. They shall be fully freed from all
their sins, and finally discharged from the
sentence of Condemnation.
Q. After what manner shall they be ac|knowledged
and acquitted?
A Openly, viz. before the Father and
the holy Angels, and the general Assem|bly
of the whole worldMat. 10. 32 Luke 12. 8 2 Cor. 5. 10.
Q. What is the benefit of Believers in
Heaven, after the day of Iudgement?
A. They shall then be made perfectly
blessed.
Q. Wherein doth that blessedness consist?
A. In full enjoying or God to all
Eternity1 Joh 3. 2 1 Cor. 13. 12 1 Thes 4. 17.
Hitherto are the matters of Faith, which
make up the first Part of the Catechism,
or what man is to believe concerning
God.
Now follows the second Part concern|ing
the duty which God requires of Man.
Q. 39. What is the Duty which God re|quireth
of Man?
A. The Duty which God requireth of
Man is obedience to his revealed Will.
Explic. Q. Doth God require any thing
to be performed by man to himself?
A. God requireth Duty from Man.
Q. What is that Duty?
A. Obedience (to obey.)
Q. What is the Rule of Mans obedience
in General?
A. Gods revealed Will.
Q. What mean you by that?
A. The written Word, or the holy
Scriptures, wherein the main purport of
them is not to reveal to us the existence
or non-existence of our actions, but their
moral conveniency; nor yet future con|tingences,
 whatsoever shall come to pass
in the world, but what may and ought
to be done by intelligent creatures, and
what by preventive love and enforcing
obligations God will expect from usDeut. 29. 29 Acts 1 6, 7 Mich. 6. 8.
Q What do you mean by those obligati|ons
that enforce the Duty which God re|quireth
of man?
A. Those beneficial resultances, or
benefits which flow from Gods relation to
Man as his Creator, Redeemer and San|ctifier.
Q. 40. What did God at first reveal

to man for the Rule of his Obedience?
A. The Rule which God at first re|vealed
to man for his obedience, was the
Moral Law.
Explic. Q. Is not Gods secret Will the
Rule of Mans obedience?
A. No.
Q. How prove you that?
A. 1. Because the Will of God as se|cret
is a peculiar Treasure which he hath
put in his own power, and will keep to
himselfActs 1. 7 Mat. 24. 36.
2. Because a man may sometimes sin
in fulfilling the secret Will of God, and
be ashamed, repenting in dust and ashes
that he hath done itActs 2. 23, 36, 37, 38.
3. Because all Creatures do this Will of
God, and none ever resisted itRom. 9. 19.
Q. Is the revealing of an event which
God hath determined, or those Actions where|by
that event shall be brought to pass, the
Rule of Mans obedience?
A. No1 Kings 11. 31, 35 with 2 Chron. 13. 5, 6, 7, c..
Q. But are not Gods own positive and
ceremonial Laws this Rule of Mans obe|dience?
A. No.
Q. How prove you that?
A. 1. Because they were so burden|some

a yoke that neither we nor the
Jews themselves were ever able to bear
themActs 15. 10.
2. Because they were never pleasing
to God irrespectively of themselves, nei|ther
did he at all ever take delight in
these Laws themselves simply conside|red
Psal. 40. 6 and 51. 16 Isa. 1. 11, 12.
3. Because these positive Laws were
such, by which men should never obtain
Eternal LifeEzek. 20 25 Heb. 7. 11, 19.
Q. What Law then is that which is the
Rule of Mans obedience?
A. The Moral Law.
Q. Why is it so called?
A. Because it hath a perpetual bind|ing
power in all Ages unto the end of
the world.
Q. When was this revealed?
A. At first.
Q. How understand you that?
A. Two waies.
1. This Law was at first given to
Adam in Innocency, God having written
it on his heart; some small remainders
whereof abide yet in mans natureRom. 2. 14, 15.
2. This Law was first revealed by
Gods immediate voice, after written
in Tables of Stone, and given to the

Church as a perpetual Rule for their obe|dience.
Q. 41. Wherein is the Moral Law sum|marily
comprehended?
A. The Moral Law is summarily com|prehended
in the ten Commandments.
Explic. Q What is it for the Moral
Law to be summarily comprehended in the
ten Commindments?

Q. 42. What is the summ of the ten
Commandments?

Explic. Q In how many Tables were
the te Commandments at first written?

Q. How many Commandments are com|prized
under the first Table, or first great
Commandment?

Q. Do the Papists well in leaving out
the second Commandment, and in their di|viding
the tenth into two?
A. NoDeut. 4. 13 Exod. 20. 17..
Q. What is the comprehensive Duty of
all the Commandments written in these two
Tables?
A. Love, Rom. 13. 9. For this, Thou
shalt not commit Adultery, Thou shalt
not Kill, Thou shalt not Steal, Thou

not Covet: And if there be any other
Commandment, it is briefly compre|hended
in this saying, Namely, Thou

of the Law?

all our Heart, and with all our Soul, and
with all our Mind, and with all our

Rom. 13. 8.
Q. What is it to love the Lord our

God with all our Heart, c?
A. It doth imply the supremacy, ar|dency
and activity of our Love, where|by
we chuse the Lord, cleave to him,
and delight in him as our chief Good,
and employ all our faculties and powers
in his service, in obedience to him out of
Love.
Q. What is the summ of the second Ta|ble
of the Law?
A. To love our Neighbour as our
selves.
Q Who is our Neighbour?

and constancy of Love, as we do our
selves.
Q. But are we not bound to love our
Neighbour with the same Degree of Love,
as we do our selves?
A. No.
Q. 43. What is the Preface to the ten
Commandments?
A. The Preface to the ten Command|ments
is in these words [I am the Lord
thy God which have brought thee out of the
Land of Egypt, out of the house of Bondage.]
Q. 44. What doth the Preface to the
ten Commandments teach us?
A. The Preface to the ten Command|ments
teacheth us, that because God is
the Lord, and our God and Redeemer,
therefore we are bound to keep all his
Commandments.
Explic. Q. How many reasons or argu|ments
are there in the Preface to oblige and
perswade us to keep all Gods Command|ments?
A. Two,
1. God is the Lord. [I am the Lord.]
2. God is our God and Redeemer. [I
am the Lord thy God which have brought
thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the
house of Bondage.]
Q. How are we bound and obliged to
keep Gods Commandments, as he is the
Lord?
A. As he is the Lord, he is our Crea|tor
and supream Soveraign, and we owe
him obedience, as we are his Creatures
and SubjectsRev. 4. 11 Psa. 100. 2,  Jer. 10. 7.
Q. You say you owe God obedience as
you are his Creatures and Subjects, what
mean you thereby?
A. We mean that once we were not,
were made, and are preserved by God,

or that we derived our Being from, an
hold it of God, and that we are und
the unlimited and absolute Dominio
and Soveraignty of God, and therefor
ought to serve and glorifie God in 
Body, and in our Spirit, which 
Gods, and to be in perfect subjection 
the Laws of Heaven.
Q. How are we bound and obliged 
keep Gods Commandments as he is our God
and Redeemer?
A. As our God and Redeemer [our
Father and Benefactor] he hath brought
us into the special relation of Children to
himself, and hath entred into Covenan
with us to bring us out of spiritual Egypt
and Bondage under sin, as he brought
his people of old out of the earthly Egypt
and the Bondage of menExod 4. 22, 23 John 8. 34, 36 Deu. 10. 22 and 11. 1 1 Cor. 6. 20 Luke 1. 74, 75.

more especially by our daily Prayer
unto him, and praises of himPs. 55. 17 and 32. 6 Pal. 50. 14, 15 23. and 51. 18, 19.

much displeased with the sin of having
any other God.

unto them, nor serve them: For I the Lord
thy God am a jealous God, visiting the ini|quity
of the Fathers upon the Children unto
the third and fourth Generation of them
that hate me; and shewing mercy unto
thousands of them that love me, and keep
my Commandments.
Q. 50. What is required in the second
Commandment?
A. The Second Commandment re|quireth
the receiving, observing, and
keeping pure and entire, all such religious
Worship and Ordinances as God hath ap|pointed

in the second Commandment, differ
from the worship required in the first?
A. The worship required in the first
Commandment hath a respect unto the
object of worship, whereby we are bound
to worship the true God, and none else:
The worship required in the second hath
a respect unto the means and manner of
worship, whereby we are bound to wor|ship
God according to the way and means
of his own appointment.
Q. What is the way and means which
God hath appointed for his worship?

Q. What doth God require in the second
Commandment, in reference to his Ordi|nances
and means of worship?
A. He requireth the receiving, ob|serving,
and keeping of them pure and
entire.
Q. What is it to receive and observe Gods
Worship and Ordinances?
A. To receive and observe them is
heartily to entertain, embrace, and at|tend
on them as oft as opportunity is of|fered,
and to make answerable improve|ment
of them.
Q. What is it to keep them pure and
entire?
A. To take diligent heed that they be
not corrupted by our own inventions
and additionsMat. 15. 9 Deut. 12. 32.
Q. How know you what Worship,

and Ordinances God hath required?
A. God hath appointed all his worsh'p
and Ordinances in his Word.
Q. 51. What is forbidden in the second
Commandment?
A. The second Commandment for|bideth
the worshipping of God by Images
or any other way not appointed in his
Word.
Explie. Q. What are the chief sins for|bidden
in this Commandment?
A. Idolatry and Superstition.
Q. Is it Idolatry, not only to worship
Idols instead of God, which is forbidden
in the first Commandment, but also to wor|ship
God by Images?
A. YesIsa. 45. 20 Exod. 32. 4, 5 Deut. 4. 15,19 with 32. 5, 17, 21.
Q. How can persons be guilty of Idola|try
in worshipping God by Images, when
they worship the true God the God that
made the Heavens and the Earth?
A. Because the Images of these men,
either do bear resemblance to the object of
their worship, or they do not; If they
do, then they worship false Gods, and
are guilty of gross Idolatry, there being
no similitude or likeness of the true God;
If they do not, then is ignorance the Mo|ther
of that D votion, and with the Sa|maritans

they worship they know not
what: Or if they do worship the true
God, they worship him ignorantly, and
know not the manner of the God that
made the Heavens and the Earth. Deut.
4. 12, 15. Isa. 40. 18. Ioh. 4. 22. Acts
17. 23. 2 Kings 7. 26.
Q. Why can there be no manner of
similitude of the true God?
A. Because he dwelleth not in Tem|ples
made with hands, and is the unap|proachable
invisible God. Acts 17. 24.
1 Tim. 6. 16.
Q. The Papists worship God by Images,
the Protestants worship God without them;
which way therefore are we to worship the
true God?
A. The way, the only infallible Judge
of Controversies hath declared unto us.
Q. Is the Pope this infallible Iudge?
A. There is no infallible Judge upon
Earth, and the Pope being but the Had
of a Party, the supream Head of the
Romanists; neither he nor they can be
Judge in their own Cause. Iam. 4. 12.
Mat. 23. 9, 10. Prov. 18. 17.
Q. Who then is the infallible Iudge of
Controversies?
A. Christ, the only begotten Son

which is in the bosom of the Father, He
is the only infallible Judge of Controver|sies,
who hath told us all things, and w
have his Determinations upon RecordJoh. 118 and 4. 25.
Q. Where are his Determinations Re|corded?
A. In the holy Scriptures.
Q. What are his Determinations con|cerning
God, and the manner of his wor|ship?
A. They are,
1. Negative, that God dwelleth not
in Temples, neither is to be worshipped
by Images made with mens hands.
Acts 17.1 Cor. 7. 10 24. with 1 Kings 8. 27. Acts
17. 25.
2. They are affirmative, viz. That
God is a Spirit, and that they that wor|ship
him, must worship him in Spirit and
truth. Ioh. 4. 23 24.
Q What other sin is chiefly forbidden in
this Commandment?
A. Superstition.
Q. What is Superstition?
A. Superstition in the proper and
strict notion of the word is the wor|shipping
of Idols, or dead men, Act. 17. 22.
But this is the same with that Idolatry,
(the giving that worship and glory to

others which is due to God alone) which
is forbidden in the first Commandment.
Q. What is therefore Superstition in the
 generally received notion, and as it is
forbidden in this Commandment?
A. It is when things are either abhor|red
or observed with a zealous or fearful,
but erroneous relation to God: by means
of which the superstitious serve either the
true God with needless Offices, or de|fraud
him of necessary Duties; or bestow
such honours and service upon others,
as is proper for, and should be peculiar
for him only. Or,
More plainly thus,
It is the worshipping of God in any
other way, or by any other means than
what he hath appointed in his Word;
called Ordinances, the Commandments
and Doctrines of menCol. 2. 20, 21, 22, 23.
Q. How manifold is this Superstition?
A. Twofold, Affirmative, and Nega|tive.
Q. What is Affirmative Superstition?
A. That whereby the Superstitious
serve the true God with needless Offices.
Q. And what the Negative?
A. That whereby men out of a s|pulous
Conscience, or ignorant fear of
displeasing God, abstain from things
lawful and laudable, as sinful and un|godly.
Q. Doth the Scripture warrant this
distinction?
A. YesEccl. 7. 16, 17 Mat. 15. 3, 6, 7 Col. 2. 20, 21, 22, 23.
Q. 1. What is the Idolatry and Super|stition
of the Church of Rome?
A. The worshipping of the Bread and
Wine in the Eucharist, out of a false and
groundless perswasion, that they are sub|stantially
changed into the Body and
Blood of Christ.
2. The worshipping and invocation of
Saints and Angels; and particularly of
the Virgin Mary, which hath now for
some Ages been a principal part of their
Religion.
3. Their worshipping of Images:
Which practice (notwithstanding all
their distinctions about it, which are no
other but what the Heathens used in the
same case) flies as full in the face of the
second Commandment, as deliberate and
malicious killing of a man is against the
sixh. Acts 17. 29. Rom. 1. 23.
4. Their superstitious Fasting, and ab

staining from Flesh in Lent; Their super|stitious
Holy-daies; Their adding Cream,
Oyl, and Spittle to the water in Baptism,
and their Baptizing of Bells; Their
praying upon Beads, and mary more su|perstitious
customs! For which there is
not the least command in the Scrip|turesCor. 18. 8 Col. 2. 20, 21 1 Tim. 4. 4, 5 Gal. 4. 9, 10, 11 Po. 30. 5, 6 Mat. 28. 19, 20.
Q. What if the Doctrine of Transub|stantiation
be not true?
A. Then by the confession of several
of their own learned Writers they are
guilty of gross Idolatry.
Q. Doth not the Bread in the Communi|on
remain Bread after the words of Conse|cration?
A. Yes, the Scripture expresly calls it
so after the words of Consecration.
1 Cor. 11. 26, 27, 28.
Q. But what if the Bread be transub|stantite
and turned into the very Body of
Christ?
A. Then all mens senses are deceived
in a plain sensible matter, wherein 'tis as
hard for them to be deceived, as in any
thing in the world.
Q. Why so?
A. For two things can hardly be
imagined more different, a little bit

of Waer, and the whole Body of 
man.
Q. But what if the Testimony of sens
be not to be relied upon?
A. Then no man is sure that Christian|ty
it self is true.
Q. Why so?
A. For the utmost assurance that the
Apostles had of the Truth of Christiani|ty,
was the Testimony of their own
senses concerning our Saviours Miracles.
Q. And what if the Testimony of sense 
to be relied upon?
A. Then it plainly follows that no
man (no, not the Apostles themselves)
had more reason to believe Christianity to
be true, than every man hath to believe
Transubstantiation to be false.
Q. But if the case be so plain, a man
would think that at least the Teachers and
Guides of that Church should be sensible
of it?
A. Why, they are so, and afraid the
People should be so too; and therefore
by their corrupt Glosses and Phrisaial
Traditions in their interpreting the holy
Scriptures, they tye up and keep the Pople
in ignorance of the true meaning of those
places, which do more expresly condemn

their damnable Idolatrous practises, and
their superstitious customs; and in their
ordinary Cachisms and Manuals of De|votion,
they leave out the second Com|mandment,
and divide the tenth into
two to make up the Number; lest if the
common people should know it, their
Consciences should startle at the doing of
a thing so directly contrary to the plain
command of God.
Q. And is it not well observed by the
learned from Deut. 11. 28. That he that
professeth Idolatry, is as if he denied the
whole Law?
A. Yes.
Q. But because after all the unanswera|ble
Objections and Arguments of the Pro|testants
against Transubstantiation, (that
Monster ad shame of humane nature) and
the other Blasphenies and absurd Doctrines
of the Papists; they do all unanimously be|take
themselves to the authority of their
Church, as their main and last Refuge;
and tell us, that though they cannot give us
a particular reason of every Doctrine they
hold different from us; yet they have
sufficient reason to submit their judgement
wholly to their Churches authority, which
they know to be infallible, and hath Decreed

all the Doctrines they hold in opposition to 
Doth it not therefore concern all that 
concerned in the matters of their Salvation
to consider whether this easie way of believing
be a safe way or no?
A. Yes, it doth very much concern 
all so to do; because our mistake herein
will greatly hazzard our everlasting Sal|vation.
Q. And are not they certainly mistaken
that adventure all, even all their everlasting
concerns, upon that authority which over|throws
those very things which must be sup|posed
antecedent to the belief of any such au|thority:
As 1. The common sense of man|kind.
2. The force of a Divine Law.
And 3. The liberty of Iudgement concern|ing
truth and falshood?
A. Yes.
Q. And doth not the Church of Rome
so?
A. Yes, and thereby forfeits its own
authority over men.
1. It requires things contrary to com|mon
sense; as in the Eucharist, it re|quires
all its members to deny what they
see, and handle, and smell, and taste to
be Bread, to be true Bread; and to be|lieve
that the same individual Body may

be in a thousand places at once, and that
things whose nature it is to be in another,
 subsist without their proper subject.
2. It requires things contrary to the
force and reason of a divine Law; as it
hath left out the second Commandment,
and hath made it lawful to give religious
worship to Images, and hath taken away
from the people their share of the Cup in
the Eucharist.
3. It takes away all liberty of judge|ment
concerning truth and falshood in
Religion. For this is a natural right
which every man hath to judge for him|self:
And they that take this away, may
as well command all men to put out their
eyes, that they may the better follow
their Guides. But the other is so much
worse, because it is an assault upon our
understandings; it is a robbing us of
the greatest Talent God hath committed
to our management, it is a Rape upon
our best faculties, and prostituting them
to the Lusts of spiritual Tyrants; it is
not captivating our understandings to the
obedience of Faith, but enslaving them to
the proud and domineering usurpations of
men; wherein they would do by us as
the Philistins did by Sampson; they

would put our eyes, that we might gind
in their Prison, and make them sport.
Q. How may men further offend and
sin against the second Comandment?
A. Men offend and sin against the se|cond
Commandment not only by Idola|try
and Superstition, but also when they
are not zealousJoh. 2. 17  4. 22, 23 for pure worship ac|cording
to Gods Institution, not endea|vouring
what in them lieth, in their
places, the Reformation of worship, ac|cording
to the pattern in the Word;
as also when they disuse andHe. 10. 25 neglect,
especiallyLuke 7. 30 Mat. 23. 13 1 Thes. 2. 16 Acts 13. 44, 45 when they contemn and op|pose
any of those Ordinances which God
hath appointed to be the means of wor|ship.
Q. 52. What are the reasons annexed
to the seond Commandment?
A. The reasons annexed to the second
Commandment, are Gods Soveraignty over
us, his propriety in us, and the zeal he
hath to his own worship.
Explic. Q. In what words are these
three reasons annexed to this Command|ment,
expressed?
A. In these words [For I the Lord
thy God am a jealous God?]
Q. What is the first reason annexed unto the
second Commandment?
A. Gods Soveraignty over us, exprest
in these words [I the Lord.]
Q. What do you mean by his Soveraignty
over us?
A. His supream power, absolute Do|minion,
and sole Authority over us.
Q. What is the force of this first reason?
A. The force of this first reason, is,
because God is the only SoveraignPs. 95. 2, 3 King
over us, and hath the sole Authority to
make Laws for the way of his worship,
therefore we ought by vertue of our al|legiance,
as we are subjects, to observe
his Laws and Ordinances, and to wor|ship
him no other way than that which he
hath appointed in his Word.
Q. What is the second reason annexed to
this Commandment?
A. Gods propriety in us, exprest in
these words, [Thy God; I the Lord thy
God.]
Q. What do you mean by his propriety
in us?
A. His just right and Title to us as his
own.
Q. What is the force of this second
reason?
A. The force of this second reason, is,
because we are Gods, therefore we ought

to keep close unto him, and his appoint|ments,
and take heed especially of Ido|latry
and superstition, which do alienate
the heart from himPs. 95. 6, 7 and 106. 19.22  45. 10, 11.
Q. What is the third reason annexed to
this Commandment?
A. The zeal God hath to his own
worship, exprest in these words [Am 
jealous God; I the Lord thy God am a
jealous GodExod. 34. 14.]
Q. What is the zeal God hath to his own
worship.
A. It is his jealousie, where by out of
love to his own worship and Institutions,
he is highly offended with those that
turn aside from him unto their own
Inventions.
Q Wherein doth this zeal and jealousie
of God for his own worship shew it self?
A. The zeal and jealousie of God for
his own worship doth shew it self,
1. In his accounting the Breakers of
this Commandment those that hate him,
and threatening to punish them unto the
third and fourth Generation; [I the
Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting
the iniquity of the Fathers upon the
Children unto the third and fourth Genera|tion
of them that hate me.] And,
2. In his esteeming the keepers of this
Commandment, such as love him, and
promising mercies unto thousands of
them [And shewing mercy unto thousands
of them that love me, and keep my Com|mandments.]
Q. How can God in justice visit the ini|quity
of the Fathers upon their Children?
A. 1. If the Children do not walk in
the sinful steps of their Fathers, God will
not visit the iniquity of their Fathers up|on
themEzek. 18. 14, 15, 16, 17.
2. It is most equal and righteous for
God to visit the iniquity of the Fathers
upon their Children, when the Children
are guilty of the same iniquity, and so
fill up the measure of their Fathers sinsEzek. 18. 24, 25 Ma. 23. 31,37.
[By consenting to, partaking of, and
imitating their Fathers sins.]
Q. 53. What is the third Command|ment?
A. The third Commandment, is,
[Thou shalt not take the Name of the
Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will
not hold him guiltless, that taketh his
Name in vain.]
Q. 54. What is required in the third
Commandment?
A. The third Commandment requireth

the holy and reverend use of Gods Names,
Titles, Attributes, Odinances, Word,
and Works.
Explic. Q What are we to understand
by the Name of God, which we are for|bidden
in this Commandment to take in
vain?
A. The Name of God, which we are
forbidden in this Commandment to take
in vain, is to be taken generally and com|prehensively
for any thing whereby God
maketh himself known.
Q. By What doth God make himself
known?

3. Unjust Swearing, or Swearing to
do that which is unjust, and in it self un|lawful

a double iniquity, and obligeth a man to
nothing but a deep unsegned Repentance.

men Swear in a light matter, and upon

6. Breaking those Oaths made by the
Creatures as not binding and valid. For

he will make instruments of vengeance to

annexed to this Commandment expressed?
A. In these words, [For the Lord will
not hold him guiltless that taketh his Name

A. The Lord will not suffer them to
escape his Judgement.
Q. Why so?
A. Because his is a righteous Judge|ment.
Q. Will the Lord punish all those that
profane, or abuse his Names, Titles and At|tributes?
A. Yes. Psal. 44. 20, 21. Acts 19.

against knowledge than those of igno|rance
Luke 12. 47, 48, sins ripened into action, than

from the time2 Chron. 28. 22. when, the place whereIsa. 26. 10. Psal. 106. 7.,
the manner1 Kings 21. 9, 10. 2 Sam. 3. 27. in which, the meansDan. 8. 24, 25. Iudg. 9. 4, 5. 2 Kings 8. 15. 2 Chron. 13. 6, 8. with 1 Kings 12. 28. by
which, the reasonHos. 5. 1. Psal. 37. 7, 8. why, the person by
whom2 Sam. 12. 7, 8, 9. Ezek. 8. 11, 12. Mich. 3. 5. Rom. 2. 23, 24, 25., and the person against whom

Gal. 3. 10. Matth. 25. 41. Rom. 2. 5 6,

Q. The Papists have a distinction of mor|tal
and venial sins: by mortal they mean
such as are in their own nature damnable
and deserve eternal death, viz. Perjury,
Murder and Adultery, or those seven in the

Popish Catechism, Pride, Covetousness,
Lusts, Anger, Gluttony, Envy and Sloth;
by Venial they mean such as are in their own
nature pardonable and deserve not everlast|ing
punishments, viz. Concupiscence, sud|den
passions of the mind and such like;
Doth the Scripture warrant this distinction
of theirs?
A. No. 1. The Scripture teacheth
us, first, that the curse of God is due to
every one that breaketh the least of Gods
CommandmentsGal. 3. 10. 2. That the wages
of sin (indiscriminatively, without any
difference) is death. And such a death
that is opposed to eternal lifeRom. 6. 23. And we
must not distinguish where the Law it
self doth not distinguish. 3. That for
every idle word that men speak, they
shall give an account thereof in the day
of Judgement, and that by such words
(if not repented of) they shall be con|demned,
Mat. 12. 36, 37. And on the
contrary, that the forementioned mortal
sins in the Popish sense, have been, and
shall be forgiven to all penitent Believers
to whom by vertue of the New Cove|nant
all such sins are become venial.

22. 32. Mark 16. 7. 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11.
Q. 85. What doth God require of us
that we may escape his wrath and curse due
to us for sin?
A. To escape the wrath and curse of
God due to us or sin, God requireth of
us Faith in Jesus Christ, Repentance unto
life, with the diligent use of all outward
means whereby Christ communicateth to
us the benefits of Redemption.
Explic. Q. Is there any way to escape
the wrath and curse of God?
A. Yes. Heb. 10. 19 20.
Q Is there any thing required on our
part to escape them?
A. Yes, Faith, Repentance, and the
diligent use of the means of Grace.

and Faith of us; or hath Christ repented
and believed for us?

Q. Why so?
A. Because Christ had no need of Re|pentance
and Faith, being without sin.
Luke 1. 35. Iohn 8. 46. 1 Pet. 2. 22.
Iohn 9. 30,34. Heb. 7. 26. Mat. 27.
19. Luke 23. 14, 15. Iohn 19. 4, c.
Acts 3. 13, 14. and 7. 52. and 22. 14.
1 Pet. 3. 18. Mat. 1. 21. Iohn 1. 29.
1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. Isa. 53. 4, 5, 6.
Q. Who communicateth to us the works of
Redmption?
A. Christ that purchased them, con|veighs
and communicates them to us.
Gal. 3. 13. Rom. 3. 24, 25, 26. 2 Cor. 5.
21. Acts 2. 36. Tit. 2. 14.
Q. Doth Christ communicate his benefits
by means, or without means?
A. By meansEzek 36. 37 Acts 9. 10, c. Ro. 10. 13, 14, 15, 17 Cant. 3. 1,5 1 Cor. 1. 21 Acts 8. 22 Jer. 6. 16.

the outward means?
A. That we may escape his wrath and
curse due to us for sin.
Q. 86. What is Faith in Iesus Christ?
A. Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving
grace, whereby we receive and rest upon
him alone for Salvation, as he is offered
to us in the Gospel.
Explic. Q Why call you Faith in Iesus
Christ a grace?
A. 1. Because it is not from natureMat. 16. 16, 17.
2. Because it is given, and wrought of
free graceEph. 2. 8.
Q. Why call you Faith a saving Grace?
A. Because where it is truly wrought,

it brings the person in whom it is to
SalvationHeb. 10. 39.
Q Doth it not then much concern us to
know what this Faith is, and to labour after
it, when we cannot be saved without it?
A. Yes.
Q. 1. Is this Faith only the believing
that Christ died for sinners?
A. No, for the Devils and Damned in
Hll believe this.
Q. 2. Or is it an implicite Faith, or a
blind Faith (which the Popish Doctors
perswade the people to rest in) to believe as
the Church believes, though they know not
what the Church believes?
A. No.
Q. Why so?
A. 1. Because, to believe as the
Church believes, when we know not what
the Church believes, is to put out our own
eyes that we may take a Guide; and if
by the Church must be understood the
Church of Rome, it is to take such a
Guide asA blind Gie, or a Seducer. Mat. 15. 14 1 John 4. 2 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3 2 Thes. 2. 7,13 either cannot, or will not
guide us aright: which is in effect to
refuse our own mercies, and to run an
unnecessary hazzard of our eternal Sal|vation.
Q. How do we by an implicite Faith in

the Church of Rome refuse our own mercies?
A. Because without personal know|ledge,
denied us by that corrupt Church,
(which yet God hath given us for this
very end, to make the true Religion judi|cially
our own) all the Ordinances of
God, viz. our Praying, Singing, Read|ing
1 Cor. 14. 14, 15. and Hearing the Word of GodActs 8. 30,36. Neh. 8. 8. Rom. 10. 14, 17. Acts 28 2529.,
CatechizingDeut. 6. 6, 7. Ephes. 6. 4. Prov. 22. 6. 1 Sam. 1. 24. Luke 2. 42, 46. with Exod. 13. 12., MeditatingIsh. 1. 8. Psal. 1. 2. and 119. 79101. and 77. 12. and 143 5., holy Con|ferences
Mal. 3. 16. Heb. 3. 13 Luke 24. 32., and receiving the Sacra|ments
Mat. 28. 19, 20. with Acts 19. 1, 2. 1 Cor. 11. 28, 29., will be altogether unprofitable
to us and in vai.
Q. And how do we hazzard our eternal
Salvation by it?
A. Because we do hereby follow the
pernicious waies of that Adulterated
Church which holds such doctrines that
do very much endanger itMat. 15. 3, 6, 9 Col. 2. 20, 21, 22, 23 1 Cor. 6. 9 with 5. 11 Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21.
Q. What other reason have you to prove
that this blind implicite Faith is not a justi|fying
and saving Faith?
A. 2. Because it secludes that know|ledge
which is a necessary ingredient in|corporate
into the very nature and essence
of true saving Faith. Isa. 53. 11. Ioh. 17. 3.
1 Ioh. 5. 20. Acts 26 18. Rom. 10. 9.
2 Tim. 1. 12. 1 Pet. 3. 15.
Q. 3. Is this justifying saving Faith a
keeping of the Commandments of God, or
obedience to his Laws, as Socinians affirm?
A. No. 1. Because obedience is the
fruit and effect of FaithRom, 16. 26.
2. Because union with Christ, Ju|stification
and Adoption are the fruits
of Faith, and not of works or obedi|enceEph. 3. 17 Rom. 5. 1 John 1. 12.
Q. 4. Is this saving justifying Faith a
full perswasion of the heart, or an assurance
that our sins are pardoned and that our souls
shall be saved?
A. No, because we must be justified
and pardoned before we can believe that
we are justified and pardoned, else we
should believe a Lie.
Q. What then is this true saving
Faith?
A. It is our hearty accepting, receiving
and resting upon Christ alone for Sal|vation,
as he is offered to us in the
GospelJohn 6. 67, 68, 69 Heb. 11. 1, 24, 25, 26 John 1. 12 Cant. 8. 5 Isa. 26. 3, 4 Gal. 2. 16.
Q. Is Christ offered to us in the Gospel
as our Prophet, Priest and King?
A. Yes. Isa. 33. 22.
Q And is it not true Faith except we
take Christ as a Prophet to be guided, as a
King to be ruled, and as a Priest to be
saved by him alone?
A. No. Acts 3. 22. Iohn 14 26. and
16. 14 Heb. 7. 21, c. Acts 2. 36.
1 Tim. 6. 14 15. Mat. 2. 2. Iohn 1. 49.
Zach. 9. 9. Luke 19. 37, 38.
Q. 87. What is Repentance unto life?
A Repentance uto life is a saving
grace whereby a sinner out of a true sense
of his sin, and apprehension of the mer|cy
of God in Christ, doth with grief and
hatred of his sin, turn from it unto God,
with full purpose of, and endeavour after
new obedience.
Explic. Q. What Repentance is here
descried?
A. Repentance unto life.
Q. Why is it so called?
A. Because it brings the person in
whom it is to Eternal LifeAct. 11. 18.
Q. Why is it called a saving grace?
A. For the same reason, viz. because
where Repentance is truly wrought, it
brings the person in whom it is unto Sal|vation
2 Cor. 7. 10.
Q. What is that which is wrought in sin|ners
as a preparation to Repentance?
A. A true sense of sinActs 2. 37.
Q. What mean you by that?
A. Such a sight of sin, as deeply af|fects
our hearts with godly sorrow
for it.
Q. What is the main motive to Repen|tance?
A. The apprehension of Gods mercy
in ChristJoel 2. 12, 19 Exo. 34 6, 7 Rom. 2. 4 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19.
Q. Can there be no true Repentance with|out
conviction, a true sight and discovery of
sin?
A. NoMt. 9. 12, 13.
Q. Will it be Despair and not Repen|tance,
except together with the sight of sin,
there be an apprehension (at least of a possi|bility)
of mercy?
A. Yes. 2 Cor. 7. 10. Mat. 27. 4. 5.
Q. In and through whom doth the peni|tent
sinner apprehend Gods mercy?
A. In and through Christ only.
Q. Doth true Repentance chiefly consist
in turning from sin to God?
A. YesActs 26 18 Jer. 31. 18. 19.
Q. How doth the repenting sinner turn
from sin?
A. With an holy indignation2 Cor. . 11 against

it, and with that grief and hatred of it,
so as never more to returnJer. 31. 18, 19 Ezk. 36. 31 2 Cor. 7. 11 Job 42. 6 and 11. 14 Isa. 30. 22 Hos. 14. 8 to it.
Q. And how doth he turn to God?
A. With full purpose of, and endea|vour
after new obedience. Acts 11. 23.
1 Kings 8. 47, 48. 2 Kings 23. 3. Rom.
6. 4. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Ephes. 4. 23, 24. Psa.
119. 6, 20.
Q. What do you mean by new obedience?
A. The penitent sinners denying un|godliness
and worldly lusts, and his living
soberly, righteously and godly in this
present world.
Q. Is not the confessing sins to God alone,
and the forsaking them sufficient without au|ricular
confession?
A. Yes. Prov. 28. 13.
Q. When is the confessing our faults one
to another necessary?
A. 1. When our offences are such as
are not only against God, but also against
our Neighbours; then we must confess
our faults to them, desire peace, and make
them satisfaction before we can reason|ably
expect Gods acceptance of our per|sons
and servicesMat. 5. 23, 24.
2. When we are not well able to
judge of our selves, to discern our
own guilts, and to take the dimensi|ons

of our faults aright, labouring under
the horrour, agony and disquiet of Con|science;
then it is necessary to go to some
discreet and learned Minister, to confess
our faults, and to open our griefs to him,
that we may receive such spiritual counsel,
advice, and comfort, as our Consciences
may be relieved; and that by the Mini|stry
of Gods Word we may receive com|fort,
and the benefit of Absolution, to
the quieting of our Consciences, and
avoiding of all scruple of doubtfulness.
Q But what do you think of the Au|ricular
Confession of sin according to the
Doctrine of the Papists; who say, that it is
necessary for every Christian to search and
examine with greatest diligence what his sins
have been, and that he is bound upon pain
of Damnation to confess all his mortal sins
unto a Priest, even his most secret sins in
heart and thought, with all the considerable
circumstances of them: Is not this a cursed
adding to the Word of God, and that in
matters necessary to Salvation?
A. Yes.
Q And is not this the lading the people
with ourdens grievous to be born, which the
Priests themselves touch not with one of their
fingers?
A. Yes.
Q. May not an Hypocrite and a graceless
 thus confess his sins to the Priest?
A. Yes.
Q. And can this confession then be so ne|cessary
a part of true Repentance, which a
man may do that never unfeignedly re|pented?
A. No.
Q 88. What are the outward means
whereby Christ communicateth to us the be|nefits
of Redemption?
A. The outward and ordinary means
whereby Christ communicateth to us the
benefits of Redemption, are his Ordi|nances,
especially the Word, Sacraments
and Prayer; all which are effectual to
the Elect for Salvation.
Explic. Q. Are Christs Ordinances the
means whereby he communicates to us the
benefits of Redemption?
A. Yes.
Q. What do you mean by Christs Ordi|nances?
A. The means and waies of worship,
ordained by him.
Q. What are his special Ordinances
whereby he communicates to us his benefits?
A. The Word, Sacraments and PrayerAct 2 41, 42.
Q. What kind of means are these?
A. The outward and ordinary means.
Q. Why are the Ordinances called the
outward means?
A. Because together with them, he
communicates his benefits by the inward
workings of hisPro. 1. 23 Isa 59. 21 Joh. 14 26 Eph. 1. 19, 20 and Heb. 13 20, 21 Phi. 2. 12, 13 Spirit.
Q. And why are the Ordinances of
Christ called the ordinary means, whereby he
communicates his benefits to us?
A. Because he hath not wholly limited
and bound up himself to his Ordinances,
but can communicate his benefits in an
extraordinary way, when, and to whom
he pleaseth.
Q. But may men reasonably expect Sal|vation
without the diligent use of the out|ward
and ordinary means?
A. No. Rom. 10. 13, 17. Mat. 3. 7.
Acts 2. 38, 39, 41. and 16. 30,35.
Q. To whom are the outward and ordi|nary
means made effectual for Salvation?
A. To the ElectRom. 1. 16 and 11. 7 Acts 13. 46, 48.
Q. 89. How is the Word made effectual
to Salvation?
A. The Spirit of God maketh the
Reading, but especially the Preaching of
the Word, an effectual means of con|vincing
and converting sinners, and of

building them up in holiness and comfort
through Faith unto Salvation.
Explic. Q. Who is it that makes the
Word effectual to Salvation?
A. The Spirit of GodJoh 14. 26 and 16. 7 c. 1 Cor. 3. 10.
Q. In what kind of exercise of the Word
dth the Spirit use to make it effectual?
A. In the Reading, but especially in
the Preaching of the Word.
Q. Will not the Word be effectual with|out
the inward workings of the Spirit?Rom. 1. 16 2 Tim. 3. 15 1 Cor. 1. 18
A. No. Ephes. 2. 17, 18, 22. 1 Pet.
1. 22. Iude vers. 19. 1 Thes. 5. 19, 20.
and 2. 2, 13.
Q. How is the Word effectual to sinners?
A. To convince and convert them;
shewing them their woful and undone
estate in themselves without Christ, and
turning them from sin unto God1 Cor. 14. 24, 25 Acts 26. 18 Rom. 7. 9 Psal. 19. 7.
Q. How is it made effectual to the
Saints?
A. To build themAct. 20. 32 Jude 20 Joh. 17. 17 Rom. 154 up in holiness and
comfort.
Q To what doth the Word thus build
them up?
A. To Salvation.
Q. Through what means?
A. Through Faith, 2 Tim. 3. 15.
Q. Will not the Word profit us then,

except it be mixed with Faith?
A. No. Heb 4. 2.
Q Is the Conviction, Conversion, San|ctification
and Consolation of sinners, the
work of the Spirit, by the Word, through
Faith?
A. Yes.
Q 90. How is the Wrd to be read and
heard that it may become effectual to Salva|tion?
A. That the Word may become effe|ctual
to Salvation, we must attend there|unto
with diligence, preparation and
Prayer, receive it with Faith and Love,
lay it up in our hearts and practise it in
our Lives.
Explic. Q What must we do that the
Word may become effectual to Salvation?
A. We must attend unto it with dili|gence.
1 Tim. 4. 13. Acts 16. 14.
Q. What is it to attend unto the Word
with diligence?
A. To bend the mind, and set the
heart and affections wholly to it, or to
give that heed to it, that will prepare the
heart readily to receive it, and to be de|livered
into the power of it.
Q. Are there not some things to be done
before we attend to the Word?
A. Two things are here expressed,
1. Preparation; and 2. Prayer.
Q In Preparation what must be done?
A. 1. We must look well to our
heart, affections, and mind that they be
fixed, composed and ordered, and we
must summon and call all that is within us
together to this service, that we may read
and hear the Word of God acceptably,
with reverence and godly fear.
2. We must follow the Apostle St. Pe|ter's
advice, 1 Epist. 2. 1, 2. Wherefore
laying aside all malice, and all guile and
hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speak|ings.
As new born Babes desire the sin|cere
milk of the Word that we may grow
thereby.
Q. And what else is here expressed to be
done before we attend unto the Word?
A. 2. Prayer.
Q How must this be performed?
A. We must Pray, 1. That God
would open our eyes that we may behold
wondrous things out of his Law. 2. That
the Word of the Lord may run and be
glorified, i. e. that we may receive, obey
and honour it with an holy, unblameable
answerable life as becometh persons pro|fessing
godliness.
Q. What doth God require of us in our
attending to the Word?
A. That we receive it.
Q How must the Word be received?
A. It must be received with Faith and
Love. Heb. 4 2. 2 Thes. 2. 10.
Q What is it to receive the Word with
Faith?
A. Soundly to believe the truth and
goodness of it, and to accept of both.
Q. What is it to receive it with Love?
A. To receive it willingly with all rea|diness
of mind. Acts 17 11. Psal. 119.
14, 20, 97, 103, 127, 162.
Q. And what doth God require of us af|ter
our attention to the Word?
A. He requireth of us two things,

1. That we lay it up in our hearts.
2. That we practise it in our lives.

Psalm 119. 11. Luke 2. 51. Luke 8. 15.

our Salvatin if duely attended to, received,
laid up in our hearts, and practised in our
lives?
A. Yes.
Q 91. How do the Sacraments become
effectual means of Salvation?
A. The Sacraments become effectual
means of Salvation, not from any vertue
in them, or in him that doth administer
them, but only by the blessing of Christ,
and the working of his Spirit in them
that by Faith receive them.
Explic. Q What other special Ordi|nances
hath God appointed as the means of
Salvation, besides the Wrd?
A. The Sacraments and Prayer.
Q Whence is it that the Sacraments be|come
effectual means of Salvation?
A. 1. Negatively, not from any ver|tue
in them, or in him that doth admini|ster
them2 Kings 5. 12 1 Cor. 3. 5. 6 Acts 8. 13, 20, 21, 23 1 Cor. 11. 27.
Q. Do not the Sacraments work upon
the Soul by their own nature, or by the
work done and the bare receiving of
them?
A. No.
Q. Doth not the efficacy of the Sacra|ments
depend upon the goodness, or badness
of him that doth administer them?
A. No.
Q How then do the Sacraments become
effectual means of Salvation?
A. 2. Positively, by the blessing of
ChristMat. 18. 20 and 28. 20 1 Cor. 3. 7, and the working1 Cor. 12. 13 of his
Spirit.
Q. In whom doth Christs blessing by the
working of his Spirit make the Sacraments
effectual to Salvation?
A. In them that by Faith receive them,
Mark 16. 16.
Q. 92. What is a Sacrament?
A. A Sacrament is an holy Ordinance
instituted by Christ, wherein by sensible
signs, Christ and the benefits of the New
Covenant are represented, sealed and ap|plyed
to Believers.
Explic. Q. What did the Word Sacra|ment
signifie in antient times?
A. It signified an Oath, whereby Soul|diers
bound themselves to be true to their
Captain, and he in like manner bound
himself to them.
Q. What is it now used to signifie?
A. Now it is used to signifie the seals
of the Covenant whereby the Lord doth
bind himself in Christ Jesus to be merciful
to us; and we bind our selves to be true
unto Christ.
Q. Is the Sacrament then an holy Or|dinance?
A. Yes.
Q. By whom are our Sacraments insti|tuted?
A. By Christ. Mat. 28. 19. 1 Cor. 11.
23, 24, 25.
Q. What do you mean by being instituted
by Christ?
A. Appointed and ordained by him.
Q. What are the parts of a Sacra|ment?
A. The sign, and the thing signified.
Q. What are the outward parts of the
Sacraments?
A. The sensible signs.
Q. Do the signs offer themselves to the
Senses?
A. Yes.
Q. And offer the things signified to our
Faith?
A. Yes.
Q. What are the inward parts of the
Sacraments?
A. Christ and the benefits of the New
Covenant, as the things signified by the
outward sensible signs.
Q What is the use and proper work of
the Sacraments?
A. To represent, seal and apply.
Q. But are the Sacraments of the New
Testament signs, and seals to all even to unbe|lievers?
A. Yes.
Q How do the Sacrameats seal to all
even to unbelievers?
A. 1. As Circumcision was a Seal of
the righteousness of Faith [or of the
Covenant] as well when Ishmael received
it, as when Abraham received itRom. 4 11 with Gen. 17 Dr. Light|foot.. God
is everlastingly true; and these are really
Seals whosoever recelves them. Many
persons take the same Physick; the ope|ration
is not the same, the Physick is the
same. And if we might call the Tree of
Life a Seal, it retains the nature of a sign,
though Adam never tasted of it. The
Rain-bow is a Covenant, though there
be thousands in the world that never
knew it was a Covenant. And it is the
use and proper work of our Sacraments
to commemorate and seal.
2. Sacraments are visible Dctrines,
Ier. 2. 31. O Generation, see ye the word
of the Lord. In the Sacraments are writ|ten
in small Characters, what at large are
found in the works of God. And Faith
acts upon these Symbols upon a doctrinal
notion, as they are teaching Ordinances.
They testifie, as a sign Christs Love, as a
Seal Gods faithfulness. The Word of
God is given us that we may believe,

and that we may be strong in Faith: So
likewise the Sacraments are given us not
only to believe, but for our increase in
Faith. And as the word Jesus Christ is
evidently set forth crucified before our
eyes, so do the Sacraments as the Oracles
of God teach us plainly the mysterie of
Faith, and the way of Salvation.
3. The Sacraments are not only signs
and Seals, but Sanctions, and such Laws
as we are charged to observe upon pain of
Gods wrathful displeasureGen. 17. 14 and Num. 9. 13 Mat. 3. 7 Luke 7. 30 Mat. 28. 19 Ma. 16. 16 Acts 2. 37, 38 and 16. 30, 31, 32 and 1 Cor. 11 24, 25 Exod. 24. 8. Which
will be more manifest by our comparing
the Scraments of the Old and New Te|stament
together; Bptism and the Lords
Supper succeeding in the place of Cir|cumcision
and the Pssover: For, as
Baptism and the sprinkling of clean wa|ter
upon us, is to wash off the filth of the
Soul that we might be clean; so was Cir|cumcision
to take away the stony heart
out of the flesh, and to give an heart of
flsh: And as the sprinkling of blood was
of old a Law in Israel; so is the Lords
Supper a Sanction of the New Testament
to us. And as Moses said. This is the
blod of the Covenant which the Lord hath
made with youExo. 24. 8 wih Mat. 26, 27, 28; here in like manner
Christ hath Preached the Gspel doctrine,

and now he comes to put a Sanction 
this Sacrament; This, saith he, is 
blood of the New Testament, which is 
for many, for the remission of sins. There
is this only disparity, the sign was 
Blood, now Wine, now Wine because
there is to be no more shedding 
bloodHeb. 9. 26 Dan. 9. 24., then blood sprinkling because
Christ our Pssover was not sacrificed for
usHeb. 9. 18,26: So that as to substance, the Sacra|ments
of the Old and Nw Testament
differ no more than the Old and New
Moon, which are not two, but one and
the same. All which considered joyntly
may sufficiently clear it to us, that our
Sacraments are not only signs and seals,
but Sanctions, yea Sanctions of the Co|venant
of Grace, or of the New Testa|ment.
And if he that despised Moses
Law, died without mercy, under two or
three witnesses, Of how much sorer punish|ment,
suppose ye, shall he be thought wor|thy,
who hath trodden under foot the Son of
God, and hath counted the blood of the
Covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, as
unholy thing, and hath done despite unto
the Spirit of GraceHeb. 10. 28, 29? For if the Word
spoken by Angels was stedfast, and every
transgression and disobedience received a just

recompence of reward: How shall we escap
if we neglct so great Salvation? which at
the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and
was confirmed to us by them that heardHeb. 2. 2, 3
him. Especially when we have Jesus
Christ thus evidently set forth, crucified
among us, not only to the ear but to the
eye, by his Word and Sacraments.
Q. But are the Sacraments effectual to
Salvation, or savingly applied only by Be|lievers?
A. Yes. Rom. 4. 11, 12.
Q 93. Which are the Sacraments of
the New Testament?
A. The Sacraments of the New Testa|ment
are Baptism and the Lords Supper.
Explic. Q. Were there other Sacra|ments
under the Old Testament, as Circum|cision
and the Passover?
A. Yes. Gen. 17. 10. Exod. 12. 43, 47.
Q. Do these remain in use now?
A. No. Rom. 10. 4 Gal. 5 2 3, 4. 1 Cor. 5 7, 8.
Q. Wat Sacraments hath Christ ap|pointed
under the New Testament, in the
room of these?
A. Baptism and the Lords Supper.
1 Cor. 12. 13.
Q. Are these two the only Sacraments of
the New Testament?
A. Yes.
Q. How doth that appear?
A. 1. Because when the number of
Sacraments were most necessary (as un|der
the Law) there were but two: and
therefore (ours succeeding in the room
of them) there can be no more.
2. Because these two Seals do fully
assure us of all Gods Graces; both of
our regnration, entrance and ingrafting
into Christ, and of our growth and con|tinuance
in him: and therefore we need
no more.
Q. But there are five more added by the
Papists as Confirmation, Pennance, ex|tream
Vction. Holy Oders, and Matri|mony;
Are not these properly and truly
Sacraments, instituted by our Lord Iesus
Christ, and necessary to the Salvation of
Mankind?
A. No.
Q. Why so?
A. The nature of a Sacrament agreeth
not to them. 1. Because they are not
all proper to the Church, but common
(as Marriage) to the Heathen. 2. They
are not all instituted by Christ, as perpe|tual

standing Ordinance. 3. They do not
consist of an outward sign (as Penace)
and inward Grace. 4. The Covenant
of Grace is not sealed in any of them.
Q. But is not Extream Vnction a Sacra|ment
instituted by Christ as a perpetual
standing Ordinance; when every sick man
is enjoyned, James 5. 14. to call for the
Elders, thse standing perpetuated Officers,
that they may pray over him, anointing him
with Oyl in the Name of the Lord?
A. N.
Q Why so?
A. 1. Because the anointing spoken of
in S. Iames was frequently omitted by
the Apostles themselves in their work|ing
of cures, and was indifferently ei|ther
used or not used by them. In
the Gospels many such cures are wrought
without it; and so in the Acts, by taking
by the hand, by embracing, Chap. 3. 7.
and 20. 10. and by Peter's bare word,
Chap. 9. 34. and so again, verse 40. And
by Paul's bre word, Chap. 14. 10. and
16. 18. and by his touching linnen
cloaths, Chap. 19. 12. All which diffe|rent
ways of healing the sick do sufficient|ly
evince that the usage of Oyl as a
bare ceremony, was not instituted by

Christ, or any way commanded to be
continued by the Apostles, or their Suc|cessors
in the Church, even while the
gift of healing did continue among
them.
2. Because that anointing with Oyl in
the Name of the Lord, was never used
on any other design than to demonstrate
theMa. 6. 13 miraculousness of the work, which
was wrought without any contribution
of natural means; and therefore is not
now of any propriety or fitness for use,
when the gift of miraculous healing is
ceased in the Church.
3. That anointing was designed on
purpose for the recovery of the sick,
whereas Extream Unction (if the coines
of Sacraments have not miscalled it)
must needs be supposed to be used only
as a Vand to those that depart out of this
world, and then only when it is thought
certain that they will die.
Q. 94. What is Baptism?
A. Baptism is a Sacrament, wherein
the washing with water, in the Name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost, doth signifie and seal
our ingrafting into Christ, and partaking
of the benefits of the Covenant of

Grace, and our engagement to be the
ords.
Explic. Q. What kind of Ordinance is
ipism?
A. It is a Sacrament.
Q. What is the sacramental Element
in Baptism?
A. WaterMa. 3. 11 Acts 8. 3, 38, (without mixture.)
Q. What are the sacramental actions?
A. 1. The Ministers blessing and con|secrating
the Water.
2. The right applying of it to the
party to be Baptizd, diving, or dipping
him into it, or sprinkling him with it.
Q. How ought the Minister to bless and
consecrate the Water?
A. 1. By opening to them that are
present the Doctrine of Baptism, and
the right institution and use of it, what
outward Mysteries are signified, and seal|ed
up by that outward sign.
2. By acknowledging in the Name of
the Congregation Mans natural pollution,
that we stand in need of spiritual wash|ing;
by giving thanks to God the Father
for giving his Son for a propitiation for
our sins, and appointing his blood to be
a Fountain to the House of Israel to wash
in; and for ordaining this service to be a

Sacrament and Seal of so great a mysterie.
3. By making profession of Faith in
Gods promises in that behalf, and pray|ing
that they be made good unto the par|ty
that is to receive the Seal thereof:
For as every thing is sanctfied by the
Word of God and Prayer; so in especial
manner the sacramental water in Bptism
is blessed and consecrated by the Word of
Institution and Prayer to God for a
blessing upon his own Ordinance.
Q Is the action of diving or dipping
essential to the Sacrament? Or is there any
ground and warrant for sprinkling, which
is mostly used with us in these cold Coun|tries?
A. The action of sprinkling water up|on
the Face of the Bptized is very
warrantable; especially upon young Chil|dren
in cold Countries, to whom diving
or dipping might be dangerous.
Q What ground hath the Church for
this practice?
A. 1. Bcause neither dipping nor
sprinkling seem to be essential to Baptism,
but washing and applying water to the
bodyJoh. 13. 10 as a cleanser of the filth thereof.
Ephes. 5. 26.
2. Because, as in the other Sacrament,

a spoonful of Wine is as significant as a
whole Gallon; so here a handful of Wa|ter
as a whole River.
3. The action of sprinkling bears fit
resemblance with the inward grace as
well as dipping, and hath Authority in
the Scripture of truth. Read 1 Pet. 1. 2.
Heb. 12. 24. where is speech of the
sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ,
and the blood of sprinkling speaking bet|ter
things than that of Abel.
4. It is not unlikely that the Apostles
Baptized as well by sprinkling or pouring
upon, as by diving or dipping into: Since
we read of divers Baptized in Houses, as
well as others in Rivers.
Q. Whose Office is it to Baptize?
A. None but the lawfully ordained
Ministers may Baptize. Mat. 28. 19, 20.
Q. In whose Name are we to be Bap|tized?
A. In the Name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Q. What do you mean by Baptizing in
the Name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost?
A. In the Authority, and into the
Faith, Profession, and Obedience of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost.
Q What is signified, sealed, and en|gaged
to, as to be done on Gods part, in
Baptism?
A. Our ingrafting into Christ, and
partaking of the benefits of the Cove|nant
of Grace. Rom. 6. 3. Act. 2. 38, 39.
Q. What is sealed to, on our part in
Baptism; or what do we engage to?
A. To be the Lords. Rom. 6. 4.
Q. Are our ingrafting into Christ, par|taking
of the benefits of the Covenant of
Grace, and our engagement to be the Lords,
signified and sealed to in Baptism?
A. Yes.
Q. 95. To whom is Baptism is to be admi|nistred?
A. Baptism is not to be administred
unto any that are out of the visible Church
till they profess their Faith in Christ, and
obedience to him; but the Infants of such
as are Members of the visible Church as
to be Baptized.
Explic. Q. To whom is not Baptism 
be administred?
A. It is not to be administred to any
that are out of the visible Church.
Q What mean you by the visible Church?
A. The visible Church is a company
of people called from all false worships

and Religions, confessedly to worship the
true God according to his WordActs 2. 47 and 4. 3 and 6. 7 Joh. 9. 22 and 12. 42 Phil. 2. 10, 11.
Q. How long is Baptism to be withheld
from them that are out of the visible
Church?
A. Till they profess their Faith in
Christ, and obedience to him. Act. 8.
36, 37.
Q. Doth Baptism disciple, make disciples
or members of the visible Church whereof
Christ alone is the Head?
A. YesMat. 28. 19.
Q. But how do you prove that the In|fants
of such as are member of the visible
Church may and ought to be Baptized?
A. 1. Because to such Infants apper|taineth
the Covenant and the thing sig|nifiedActs 2. 39 Mat. 19. 14.
2. Because whole Families were Bap|tized,
and there is pregnant probability,
that there were some Infants among them
of those House-holds. Acts 16. 14, 15, 33.
Q. But suppose there  were no Children
in those Families; how then is it required
t our hands to Baptize Infants?
A. Those that plead this, plead their
own ignorance; 1. Because in the Jewish
Church, this was their custom, when Pa|rents
came to be Baptized, Children came

be Baptized also, and their whole Family.
And secondly, If there were Children in
those Families; as that Jewish custom
(over-ballancing the others groundless
supposition) renders it most probable;
be it known to all such unnatural Parents
as reject Infant Baptism, that they har|den
their hearts against their own flesh.
Q Why so?
A. Because Children are parts of Pa|rents;
and by this contempt of Baptism
they reject the Counsel of God against
themselves, and their ChildrenInk. 7. 30.
Q What other reason have you for In|fant
Baptism?
A. 3. Children were ever admitted to
the sign and Seal of this Covenant, which
of old was Circumcision; and Baptism
succeeds in the room of Circumcision.
Q. How doth that appear?
A. 1. It appears in that the Apostle of
the Circumcision commands Baptism up|on
the same ground that Circumcision
wasAct. 1. 38, 39 with Gen. 17. 12 and 21. 3, 4 and Luk 1. 9 and 2. 21.
2. Because St. Paul in Col. 2. gives to
Baptism the very Name of Circumcision,
to teach us that it succeeds i.
Object. But if Baptism ought to be ad|ministred
to all those to whom Circumcision

was administred, because Baptism succeeds
Circumcision; by the same reason the Eu|charist
ought to be administred to all those
who did eat the Paschal Lamb, seeing the
Eucharist succeeds the Iewish Passover:
But you stay longer before you admit your
Children to the Lords Supper, than the
Iews did before they admitted their Children
to the eating of the Paschal Lamb.
A. The Jews admitted their Children
to eat of the Paschal Lamb, so soon as
they were able to eat flesh, and to ask
their Fathers the reason of that legal cere|mony;
and we defer the admitting of
ours to the Lords Supper until they be
capable of those dispositions which God
requires; and are able to examine them|selves
according to the command of the
Apostle, 1 Cor. 11. Let a man examine
himself; and so let him eat of that Bread,
and drink of that Cup.
Q. 96. What is the Lords Supper?
A. The Lords Supper is a Sacrament
wherein by giving and receiving Bread
and Wine according to Christs appoint|ment,
his Death is shewed forth, and the
worthy receivers are not after a corporal
and carnal manner, but by Faith made
partakers of his Body and Blood, with

all his benefits unto their spiritual nou|rishment
and growth in Grace.
Explic. Q. What is the other Sacra|ment
of the New Testament called?
A. The Lords Sup.
Q. Why so?
A. Because it was instituted at that
time after the Paschal Supper was endd.
Q. Are we therefore bound to celebrate it
alwaies at the same time?
A. No, because there is no command
for it, nor is there the same reason for it
now as then; this circumstance of time
not obliging us to do it after Supper any
more than the fashion of lying along
binds us to the using of the same posture;
both of them being upon occasion of the
Paschal Supper then.
Q. Why do you super add the circum|stance
and limitation of that present time?
A. Because the first Paschal Supper
in Egypt was eaten standing; but after|wards
sitting and lying along, leaning
one on anothers breasts, in sign of their
rest and security, otherwise than they
had in Egypt.
Q. What are the sacramental Elements
in the Lords Supper?
A. Bread and Wine.
Q What are the sacramental actions?
A. Breaking the Bread, giving and
receiving the Bread and Wine.
Q. What is signified by the Bread and
Wine?
A. The Body and Blood of Christ.
Q. What are the Ministers actions?
A. Breaking the Bread, and giving
the Bread and Wine, not withholding
the Cup from the people, as the Papists
sacrilegiously do.
Q. What is signified by the Ministers
breaking the Bread?
A. Christs Body being broken for us.
Q. Why must the people partake of the
Elements of both kinds?
A. Because all that were present at
the first Sacrament, given by the Lord
Jesus himself, did so.
Q How dth that appear?
A. By the plain express words of
Scripture. Mat. 26. 26, 27. Mark 14.
22. 23.
Q. But all present at the first Sacrament
were the twelve, whom Christ sent forth as
Apostles to Preach the Word and administer
the Sacraments, and therefore they and
their Successors only had the privilede to
drink of the Cup?
A. 1. By this argument the Bread
may be taken away from the people too,
and so they would have no right to any
part of this Sacrament: And what is this
but egregious sacriledge in robbing the
people of their highest Church-privi|ledge?
2. The practice and writings of the
ancient Church in this matter, which is
the best way to explicate any such diffi|culty
in Scripture, is a clear Testimony
that both the Bread and the Wine belong
to all the people, in the Name of the
twelve Disciples at that time.
Q. What is signified by the giving of the
Bread and Wine?
A. Gods giving all Christ to us.
Q. What is the peoples action?
A. Receiving (eating and drinking)
the Bread and Wine.
Q. What is signified by the peoples re|ceiving?
A. Their taking a whole Christ.
Q. Why are the Bread and Wine given
apart, and not together?
A. To shew forth Christs Blood, in
the parting of his Blood from his Body.
Q. What is the rule of Administration
and Participation?
A. All must be done according to
Christs appointment.
Q. For what end is this Supper cele|rated?
A. Hereby Christs death is shewed
orth.
Q. How many sorts of Receivers are
there?
A. Two; worthy, and unworthy.
Q. What do the unworthy Receivers par|take
of?
A. They pertake of the outward Ele|ments
only.
Q. What do the worthy Receivers par|take
of?
A. They partake of Christs Body and
Blood1 Cor. 10. 16.
Q. After what manner do not these wor|thy
Receivers partake of Christs Body and
Blood?
A. Not after a corporal and carnal
manner; they partake not of the sub|stance
of his flsh and blood.
Q. Why so?
A. For that is in HeavenAct. 1. 11 and 3. 21.
Q. But do not you affirm with the Pa|ists,
that in this Sacrament the Body and
Blood, together with the Divinity of Iesus
Christ, are truly, really and substantially

present; and that the whole substance of the
Bread is converted into his Body, and the
whole substance of the Wine into his
Blood?
A. N, should we do it, our Senses,
our Reason, and the Word of God would
give us the Lye: We perceive by our
Senses that the Bread and Wine are the
same they were before Consecration:
And we are not more certain that there
is a God who created us, and a Sun that
gives us light; than we are fully per|swaded
that the Divinity of Jesus Christ
is every where, and his humane nature
at the right hand of God, from whence
he shall come to Judge the quick and the
dead.
Q. And why are you afraid to affirm,
that the Elements of Bread and Wine art
transubstantiate and changed into the sub|stance
of the Body and Blood of Christ,
when the Scripture is plain and express that
Christ took the Bread, and said, [This is
my Body.] And after the same manner
took the Cup, which Protestants, as well as
Papists, interpret figuratively for the Wine
in the Cup, and said, [This is my blood
of the New Testament, c.] as you
my read in the following Texts, Mat.

26. 26, c. Mark 14 22, c. 1 Cor.
11. 23, c.
A. Indeed if the forecited Texts
ought to be understood in the literal
sense, we need not dread this Popish Do|ctrine;
But if they ought of necessity to
have a mystical and figurative sense and
interpretation put upon them, we may
well enough be afraid of that Doctrine,
which the Papists themselves in the sup|posed
case confess to be gross damnable
Idolatry.
Q But if we once take this liberty to
impse our mystical or figurative Interpreta|tion
on the Scripture without express war|rant
of the Scripture it self, we shall have
no setled belief, but be liable continually to
be turned aside by any one that can invent a
new mystical meaning of the Scripture,
there being no certain rule to judge of such
meanings, as there is of the literal ones:
Nor is there any error, how absurd and im|pious
soever, but may on such terms be ac|corded
with the Scripture: Why therefore
must we of necessity suppose the forecited
Texts to be understood in the figurative,
and not in the literal sense?
A. 1. Because the letter is contrary
and repugnant to our senses; which the

Scripture it self intimates to be of infal|lible
certainty1 Joh. 1.  1, 2, 3 Luke 1 1, 2 1 Cor. 15. 5, 6 with 14 Joh. 20 25, 27.
2. It is absurd and contradictive of
right reason.
3. There appears much in the contexts
to cross it, nothing at all to counte|nance
it.
4. Because other places collated, ex|presly
thwart and contradict itRom. 6. 9, 10 Mat. 28. 6 Joh. 13. 1 Mat. 26. 11 Luke 24. 39 with Heb. 2 14, 16, 17 Joh. 16. 28 Act. 1. 9, 10 and 3. 21 2 Thes. 1. 7.
Q. What sense then may or must be put
upon the forecited Texts?
A. It will be an Introduction and a
very good help to us for the right under|standing
of the said Texts, to consider
those observations taken from the Jewish
phrases and customs used in this matter,
viz. 1. That the Lamb that was drest
in the Paschal Supper and set upon the
Table, was wont to be called the Body
of the Passover, or the Body of the Pas|chal
Lamb; and probably Christ alludes
to this phrase, when he saith, This is my
Body; as if he should say, the Paschal
Lamb and the Body of it, (i. e. the re|presentation
of that on the Table in the
Jewish Feast) that was the memorial of de|liverance
out of Egypt, and type of your
deliverance out of the state of sin and
death, I will now have abrogated; and

do now institute Bread and Wine instead
of that Paschal Lamb, that you may
hereafter retain and continue to posterity
a Memorial and Symbol of me, who am
the Lamb of God which taketh away the
sin of the world, and am now about to
be sacrificed for you. This for the words
[My Body and my Blood:) But then
2. For the whole phrase, and form of
speech, [This is my Body, this is my
Blood.] It seems to be answerable to
(and substituted instead of) the Paschal
form (This is the Bread of affliction, which
our Fathers eat in Egypt: or, This is the
unleavened Bread, c. or, This is the
Passover.] And therefore the Bread and
the Wine in the Eucharist are no more the
very Body and Blood of Christ, than that
Bread which the Children of Israel eat in
the Land of Canaan was that Identical,
that very Bread of affliction which their
Fathers eat in the Land of Egypt.
Q. Is not this Popish Doctrine that the
Bread of the Eucharist is transubstantiated
into the Body, and the Wine into the Blood
of Christ, a very ancient Doctrine?
A. It is but four hundred fifty nine
years,I  in the Coun|cil of La|teran, 1215.
since it was declared by Pope Inno|cent
the third, in the Council of Lateran.
Q Is not this impossible and incompre|hensible
error of Transubstantiation to be re|jected
with our utmost Detestation?
A. Yes.
Q. Doth not this Doctrine suppose a silly
Priest to do that which all the Angels cannot
do, and that is to make his Maker, as the
Papists call the Host, and the people to de|vour
their God?
A. Yes.
Q Can they justifie this by Gods omnipo|tency,
that God is able to effect it?
A. No, this is no better argument
than the Turks may justifie most of the
sopperies of their Alcoran by.
Q. What reasons and grounds have you
for the rejection of this abomination?
A. There are two grounds especially
for the rejection of it.
1. The Idolatry and Sacriledge which
doth ensue upon it, and that is the Ado|ration
and worship of the Host, a piece
of Bread, and the mutilation or maiming
of the Sacrament by Bread only, and
the propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ him|self
in the Mass, who was once only of|fered
up to God upon the Cross, all
which are the issue of this error.
2. The Monsters of contradiction and

absurdity to sense and reason, which fol|low
thereupon. It was begotten by
feigned Miracles and fabulous Legends,
and is the Mother of Blasphemies and in|extricable
absurdities, and hath set Faith
it self on the Rck, and surpasseth all the
Harlotry that the Adulterate Church of
Rome, that Mother of Fornications, ever
brought forth.
Q. If you can but make good this high
charge you have drawn up against that most
degenerate and corrupted Church of Rome,
in this one error of Transubstantiation being
comprehensive of all errors; (Papl Rome
being nothing else but the worst corruption
of the once most famous Church of Rome,
whose Faith was spoken of throughout the
world) you may easily perswade all the
friends of the Bride, the Lambs Wife, to
aboinate all the other Fornications of that
Whorish Church: And because the Prote|stants
Arguments against Transubstantiati|on
may convince us how fully they have made
good this charge, pray produce a few of the
many Arguments they have against this Mo|ther
Error?
A. 1. Suppose Christ sitting at the
Table with his Disciples, and eating ths
Bread, and drinking this Cup first, as

the custom at the Paschal Supper was,
and as the Papists generally, and the Fa|thers
hold, and we deny not, because the
Scripture seems plain for it, Mat. 26. 29.
Hence forth I will not drink of the fruit of the
Vine; supposing therefore this, How is
it possible or imaginable that he should
eat himself? or how can he sit at Table,
and yet be in the mouths of the Apostles?
Was he at the same time in the Apostles
mouths or stomachs, while he sate and
rose from Table, and discoursed those
three Chapters of Iohn 15, 16, 17. Or
while he sweat that bloody sweat in his
Agony in the Garden, c. A monstrous
impossibility!
2. It's impossible to make that which
was before existent and in being: Can a
Father beget a Son that is already begot|ten?
Can an Architect build an House
that is already built? Can the Body of
Christ, which is before the Conversion of
the Bread, be made or produced by the
turning of Bread into it? Can he that
was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and
born of the Virgin Mary, be made by pro|nouncing
of four or five words? If ever
delusions were strong, these are; For, to
make that which is made, and to unmake

that which is made, are equally impos|sible.
3. They say that the substance of
Bread and Wine is avoided, and that on|ly
the accidents remain; so that there is
length and nothing long, breadth and no|thing
broad, thickness and nothing thick,
whiteness and nothing white, moisture
and nothing moist, sweetness and nothing
sweet, that is, a long, broad, thick,
white, moist, sweet nothing. The Priest
pours out nothing but Lines and Colours,
when he pours out the Wine, for these
accidents of Bread and Wine are not in
the Bread, because that is avoided and
vanisht, and they are not in the Body of
Christ, as themselves say, and yet it is
plain this Bread and Wine do nourish the
Body, and is the Body nourished by meer
accidents? Can there be plainer contra|dictions?
4. Can the same Body at the same time
have his just Dimensions, distance of
parts, symmetry, proportion, as the Bo|dy
of Christ hath, and yet not have
these, because all parts? Yea, the whole
Body of Christ, say they, is in one and
the self same point or crumb of Bread.
5. Can the Body of Christ, which is
much greater, be wholly contained in a
Waer or piece of Bread, in his full Di|mensions,
and that as many times as
there are points, crumbs, drops in the
Bread or Wine?
6. Can the Bread be turned into the
very Body of Christ, and yet not any
thing of that Bread become any thing of
Christ, nor the matter, nor form, nor
accidents of Bread be made either the
matter, or form, or accidents of Christ?
7. Can the same thing, as Christs true
Body, at the same time be wholly above
it self, and wholly below it self, within
and without it self? Can it be moved,
and yet be still? be carried from one place
to another, and yet not move? be
brought from Heaven to Earth, and yet
not come out of Heaven? Who then can
assure us that when Christ hung upon the
Cross, he was not walking somewhere
else, Crucified and not Crucified, eaten
and not eaten, alive in one and dead in
another place?
8. What dishonour do these men ren|der
the Body of Christ obnoxious unto,
to be eaten by wicked men, by brute
Creatures, by Mice, by other vermine,

to be cast into some unclean place? For
so long as the form of Bread remains, so
long the Body of Christ is there, though
it be in the Mouth or Belly of a Mouse,
saith Hales, and the rest of the School|men,
who do one where or another ac|knowledge
the most of these monstrous
Absurdities, and go about to heal, and
solve them.
Q. We shall surcease from raking fur|ther
into the ingrateful sink, whose Name
Transubstantiation is but of yesterday in
comparison, and which dishonours the Body
of Christ, into a Monster, destroyes the na|ture
of a Sacrament, and fills the world with
dreadful Contentions and broils: And shall
now consider with our selves what may pro|fitably
be observed from all this: What
therefore may be observed upon the whole
matter?
A. We may observe, 1. What grievous
impositions the Romanists lay upon the
Faith of them that are devoted to her
Communion.
2. What contradictions and absurdities
the common people do ignorantly and
implicitly believe.
3. What strong delusions even to be|lieve
lies God gives up learned men unto,

that refuse the simplicity of the truth for
interests and politick ends!
4. What a Mercy of God it is to de|liver
us from that Tyranny, which leaves
us no other choice, but to swallow and
digest such impossible things, or to be sa|crificed
in flames, and the Lord forbid
the Re-entrance of that Religion among
us,Mr. Vines on the Sa|crament. which in all likelihood will cost us
our Souls, or our Lives.
Q. Since the worthy Receivers are not
after a corporal and carnal manner partakers
of Christs Body and Blood; After what
manner are they partakers of them?
A. By Faith.
Q How understand you that?
A. As truly as the Minister gives them
the Bread and Wine, so truly doth God
give them the Body and Blood of Christ,
that is, the Crucified Saviour, not by
local motion, but by real communicati|on,
not to their teeth, but to their Souls;
and consequently exhibits to them all the
benefits thereof to their spiritual nou|rishment
and growth in Grace, and all
the advantages that flow to them from the
death of Christ.
Q. 97. What is required to the worthy
receiving of the Lords Supper?
A. It is required of them that would
worthily partake of the Lords Supper,
that they examine themselves of their
knowledge to discern the Lords Body,
of their Faith to feed upon him, of their
Repentance, Love and new Obedience:
lest coming unworthily, they eat and
drink Judgement to themselves.
Explic. Q. How ought Christians to
partake of the Lords Supper?
A. They ought to partake worthily
(that is suitably) with a suitable frame
of heart to this Ordinance.
Q. What is the great duty of those that
would thus partake?
A. It is required that they examine
themselves.
Q. How many things must they examine
themselves about?
A. Five especially, viz. 1. Knowledge.
2. Faith. 3. Love. 4. Repentance.
5. New Obedience.
Q. Must every one that cometh to the
Lords Supper have Knowledge?
A. Yes.
Q Why is Knowledge necessary?
A. To discern the Lords Body1 Cor. 11. 28, 29.
Q. What other graces must they examine
themselves about?
A. Their Faith, Repentance and
Love.
Q. In their examination, what must they
look after?
A. Two things especially; 1. That
they have these Graces. 2. That the
said Graces be in readiness for service and
exercise, that is, that they so stir up
these Graces of the Holy Ghost, as they
may be most profitably exerted in this
most Sacred solemn Ordinance.
Q. Why is Faith necessary?
A. To feed on Christ. Iohn 6. 53.
Q. Why is Repentance necessary?
A. Repentance for sin will fit them to
receive, and sweeten their receiving the
benefits of Christs death to their Souls.
Q. Why is Love necessary?
A. Because they who have no Love to
God and Christ, and their Brethren, are
unfit to receive the pledge of Gods Love
to themselves.
Q. What else must they examine them|selves
about?
A. New Obedience, whether they
propose and practise it in any good mea|sure.
Q. Why is New Obedience necessary?
A. Because Christ only communicates

the benefits of his death to them that
obey himHeb. 5. 9.
Q. What if any Communicants shall eat
this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord
unworthily?
A. They shall be guilty of the Body
and Blood of Christ1 Cor. 11. 27.
Q. What danger is there in that?
A. All such Communicants eat and
drink Judgement to themselves1 Cor 11. 29.
Q. 98. What is Prayer?
A. Prayer is an offering up of our de|sires
to God for things agreeable to his
Will, in the Name of Christ, with con|fession
of our sins and thankful acknow|ledgement
of his mercies.
Explic. Q. What are the parts of
Prayer?
A. Confession, Petition, and Thanks|giving.
Q. And how many things are there, as
the matter of these?
A. Three; our sins, as the matter of
our Confession; our desires and wants,
as the matter of our Petition; and our
Mercies as the matter of our Thanks|giving.
Q. What is Confession?
A. A due acknowledgement of our

sins with all their several aggravating cir|cumstancesDan. 9. 4, c. 2 Sam. 24. 10.
Q. What is Petition?
A. The offering up of our desires to
God.
Q. To whom are we to direct our Prayers?
A. To God onlyPsa. 5. 2, 3.
Q. Why are we to direct our Prayers only
to God?
A. 1. Because Prayer is such a specia
part of religious worship, that it is
sometimes in holy Writ put for theGen 4. 26 Acts 9. 14 Jer. 10. 25 Psal. 79. 6 and 116. 13 Gen. 12. 8
whole worship of God, and God is the
only object of religious worshipMat. 4. 10 Rev. 19. 10 and 22. 8, 9.
2. Because God only is omniscient and
omnipresent to know our wants and hear
our Prayers. 1 Kings 8. 38, 39. Psal.
34. 15. Isa. 63. 16.
3. Because the Title of a Hearer of
Prayers is one of Gods Peculiars, and
that glory which he will not give to any
otherPsal. 65. 2 Mat. 4. 10.
4. It is Paganism, and gross Idolatry
to give so principal a part of divine wor|ship,
and to do service to them that by
nature are no Gods. Gal. 4 8.
5. Because God only is Almighty and
can answer our Prayers, he is All-suffici|ent
and will fulfill all our Petitions1 Tim. 6. 15 Psal. 145. 18, 19 and 20. 4, 5.
Q. Are therefore forbidden to Pray to
Saints and Angels?
A. We are forbidden to Pray to them,
upon pain of Gods high displeasure, and
such punishments as he will inflict upon
all such as shall contemn or neglect their
known duty to him, by intruding into
those things which they have not seen.
Exod. 20. 5. and 34. 14. Col. 2. 18.
Q. The Papists please themselves, and
condemn Protestants in point of Praying to
Saints and Angels, as Intercessors to God,
as if there were some special humility in so
doing; Have they any ground for this
Doctrine?
A. They search into those things which
they know nothing of, and have no
other ground for this Doctrine but their
own carnal Phantasie. Col. 2. 18.
Q. For what must we make our ad|dresses
to God in Prayer, or offer up our de|sires
to him?
A. For things agreeable to his Will1 Jh. 5. 14.
Q. How shall we know what things are
agreeable to the Will of God?
A. By the written Word, the Com|mandments
and Promises of it.
Q In whose Name must we Pray?
A. In the Name of ChristJoh. 16 23.
Q. What mean you by that?
A. For Christs sake and worthinessDan. 9, 17 with A s 2. 36 Luke 1. 43 and 2. 11 See Cardi|nal Bellar|mine, in his first Book of Indul|gences, Chap. 2..
Q. Doth not the Romish Divinity say
plainly that there are some Saints and
Martyrs, who have suffered more than their
sins did deserve; and that their superabun|dant
satisfactions are put into the Treasury
of the Church, and distributed by the Popes
Indulgences?
A. Yes.
Q The Papists with one hand lay hold on
the Merits of Christ, but with the other
they lay hold on the Merits of Saints, and
Martyrs: Can they deny this?
A. They cannot deny it: For before
God and his Angels, their Priests, when
they sing Mass, Pray unto God, not only
through the Merits of Jsus Christ, but
also through the Merits of Saints, whose
Reliques are under the Altar.
Q. Do not their Devotoes [the more
superstitiously devout Papists] publickly as|sert
that the holy Virgin saves us, and brings
us into heavenly glory, not only by her
Prayers, but also by her Merits?
A. Yes.
Q. Doth not this Opinion of theirs border
upn Blasphemy?
A. Yes.
Q. Are there not in Rome it self pub|lished
certain Indulgences,See this Indulgence in the book of the Ce|remonial of Bishops, page 381. of the Ro|man Editi|on, 1606. By the Prayers,
and by the Merits of the holy Virgin Mary,
of Michael the Archangel, of St. John Bap|tist,
of the holy Apostles, Peter and Paul,
and of all the Saints, without any mention
at all of Iesus Christ, or his Merits?
A. Yes.
Q. And is not this egregious horrid Sa|criledge?
A. Yes.
Q. Are we therefore to Pray to the Fa|ther
in the Name of Christ, and in his Name
only?
A. Yes.
Q. Why so?
A. 1. Because none but Christ were
ever called to the honour of an everlast|ing
Priest-hood, to appear in the presence
of God forHeb. 5. 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 9. 24, 25, 26. us: And it would be sinful
in us to imagine the Saints or Angels to
usurp an Office, and assume to themselves
that honour they were never called unto
by God, as Christ was.
2. Because he alone is able to save us
to the utmost; and seeing he ever liveth
to make Intercession for us (presenting
himself before God, and that one once
offered perfect Sacrifice for sin for us)

we should much derogate from the suffici|ency
of Christs undertakings, to suppose
any need of the Intercession of Saint or
Angels.
Q. And what is the third part of Prayer?
A. Thanksgiving.
Q. What is Thanksgiving?
A. The thankful acknowledgement of,
and a faithful rendring unto God the
praise that is due unto his NamePsal. 103. 1, 2 and 29. 1, 2 1 Thes. 5. 18 Phil. 4. 6.
Q. 99. What rule hath God given for
our direction in Prayer?
A. The whole Word of God is of use
to direct us in Prayer; but the special
rule of Direction is that Form of Prayer
which Christ taught his Disciples, com|monly
called the Lords Prayer.
Explic. Q. What is generally useful for
our direction in Prayer?
A. The whole Word of God.
Q. But have we not left us upon Record,
some special rule for our direction in Prayer?
A. Yes, the Lords Prayer. Matth. 6.
Luke 11.
Q. Why is that Form recorded in the
Gospels, called the Lords Prayer?
A. Because the Lord Jesus taught it his
Dsciples. Luke 11. 1, 2.
Q. Of what use is the Lords Prayer?
A. To direct us in Prayer.
Q. Is it only of use to direct us in
Prayer?
A. No.
Q. Is not the saying the very words of
the Lords Prayer commended unto us, if not
commanded?
A. Yes, Luke [Chap. 11. 2.] hath
it, When ye Pray, say, Our Father, c.
Q. What kind of Forms may our Prayers
be presented in?
A. Either in set or extemporary un|prescribed
Forms.
Q. Are set Forms of Prayer lawful?
A. Set Forms of Prayer are lawful,
both as the word [Set] signifies pre|meditate
limited Forms, as opposed to
extemporary; and as it signifies pre|scribed,
and for some occasions and uses
commanded.
Q. How do you prove it lawful to use a
set determinate Form of words, either writ|ten
or fastened in our memory?
A. It is apparent both by the example
of Christ, who in St. Luke bids us, when
we pray, say, Our Father, c. (Not
only pray after this Pattern, as the words
in St. Matthew may be interpreted, but
use these very words, When you pray,

say, Our Father, c Luke 11. 2.) and
of Iohn Baptist, who taught his Disci|ples
to pray in some Form, though we
know not what it is, Luke 11. 1. As also
of the Priests under the Law, by Gods
appointment, that used a Set Form of
blessing the People, Numb. 6. 24, c.
And of our Saviour himself, who used a
a part (if not the whole) of the 22.
Psalm upon the Cross, My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me, c. And of
the Church of the Jews, and Christian
Churches through all times, who have
had their Liturgies, as waies and Forms
of serving God publickly, and as means
to preserve the true Religion from all cor|ruptions
in Doctrine. And to these Argu|ments
may be aded one more of common
observation, that even when the Minister
(or whosoever is the mouth of the rest)
prayeth, though in a Form of his own
present extemporary effusion, yet at that
time all others present are limited to his
conceptions, and pray in as stinted a Form,
as if what the Minister prays were read
out of a Book, or dictated by his Me|mory.
Q. But how do you prove it lawful to use a
Set (as that signifies a prescribed) Form of
Prayer?
A. It is apparent, 1. By Christs pre|scribing
one, which he would not sure
have done, if it had not been lawful to
have used it being prescribed; and so
also, 2. By the other examples mention|ed,
which are most of them prescripti|ons.
3. By the no Objection against the
use of them; For sure, if it be lawful to
use them, it is lawful to prescribe them at
some time, and for some uses, (for that
a thing in it self acknowledged, and
proved to be lawful, should by being
commanded by lawful Authority become
unlawful, is very unreasonable, unless
lawful Magistrates be the only unlawful
things) and at other times to use other
liberty is not forbidden, and so hereby
there is not any invasion or Tyranny used
upon our Christian liberty. 4. By the
great benefit that accrues to the Congre|gation
in having discreet well formed
Prayers, and so not subject to the tem|rity
and impertinences of the sudden effu|sions;
and the same still in constant use,
and so not strange or new to them, but
such as in which they may with under|standing
go along with the Minister, and
by the help of their Memory the most ig|norant
may carry them away for his pri|vate

use, and generally those that want
such helps, are by this means afforded
them. And lastly, by the consideration
of this one special farther advantage of
them, viz. that by means of prescribed
Liturgies the Unity of Faith, and Cha|rity
is much preserved.
Q Well then, supposing these Set Forms
to be lawful in themselves, and lawful to
be prescribed; whether may any other be
used but such?
A. Yea doubtless:See H's practical Catechism, p. 239. For the Church be|ing
obeyed in the observance of the pre|scribed
Liturgy in publick, permits some|times
(and upon special incidental oc|casions
prescribes) other Forms in the
publick Congregation, so it be done pru|dently,
and piously, and reverently, and
to Edification; and so also in the Family,
or in visitation of the sick, if the parti|cular
condition of one or other do require
it: and in private, in the Closet, it is
not supposed by the Church of England
but that every one may ask his own wants
in what form of words he shall think fit;
which that he may do fitly and reverently,
it will not be amiss for him to acquaint
himself with the several addresses to God,
which the Book of Psalms, and other

parts of holy Writ, and all other helps of
devotion will afford him, either to use as
he finds them fit for the present purpose,
or by those patterns to direct and prepare
himself to do the like.
Q 100. What doth the Preface of the
Lords Prayer teach us?
A. The Preface of the Lords Prayer,
which is [Our Father which art in Hea|ven]
teacheth us to draw near to God
with holy reverence and confidence, as
Children to a Father, able and ready to
help us, and that we should pray with
and for others.
Explic. Q. How many parts are there
in the Lords Prayer?
A. Three, the Preface, the Petitions,
and the Conclusion.
Q. Which is the Preface of the Lords
Prayer?
A. Our Father which art in Heaven.
Q. How must we draw near to God in
Prayer?
A. As Children to a Father.
Q. Hw is that?
A. With reverenceGen. 18. 7 Psal. 115. 3 Mal. 1. 6 2 Chron. 6. 13 Psal. 95. 6 Dan. 6. 10 Psal 89. 7 and 111. 9 Eccl. 5. 1, 2, and confidence1 Joh. 5. 14 Eph. 3. 12 Mat. 7. 7,12 and 21. 22 Joh. 14, 13, 14 and 15. 7 and 16. 23, 24 1 Joh 3 22 Rom. 8. 15.
Q. Must we come to God with all holy
reverence and confidence, because he is our
heavenly Father?
A. Yes.
Q. What encouragement have we so to
do?
A. Because he is able and ready to
help us, as a Father his Children.
Q. In what words are his readiness and
ability implied?
A. His readiness in these words [Our
Father] his ability in these [which art
in Heaven.]
Q. Why do you say, Our Father, and
not my Father?
A. Because we ought not only to pray
by our selves, and for our selves; but
with and for others.
Q. Must we pray for all?
A. Yes1 Tim. 2. 1 Gen. 17. 18 and 20. 7 1 Kin. 13 6 Ezr. 6. 10, excepting those that have
sinned the sin unto death1 Joh. 5. 16.
Q. Must we pray for our enemies?
A. YesMat. 5. 44.
Q. Whom must we pray for especially?
A. For theEph. 6. 18 Psal. 28. 9 and 122. 6 Church of God.
Q. And whom must we pray for more
particularly?
A. For Magistrates and Ministers.
1 Tim. 2. 1. 2 Thes. 3. 1. Heb. 13. 18.
Col. 4. 3. Ephes. 6. 18, 19.
Q. May we not pray for those who are
yet unborn?
A. YesJoh. 17. 20.
Q. But may we pray for those that are
dead and departed out of this life?
A. No.
Q. Why so?
A. 1. Because we find not any com|mand
or example in the Scripture, that
Prayers are to be made for souls departed;
but have the example of David (that
man after Gods own heart) against it.
2. The souls of the righteous in Hea|ven
stand in no need of our Prayers,
and the souls of the wicked in Hell can
receive no good by them, or by the pre|tended
sacrifice of the Mass.
Q. But where are those souls pretended to
be, that are thought, by the Papists, to be
profited by their Prayers, and their sacrifice
of the Mass?
A. In Purgatory.
Q. If then there be no Purgatory, do
not the Papists themselves grant it us, that
there are no Prayers to be made for the
Dead?
A. Yes.
Q. What souls do the Papists tell us must
go to Purgatory?
A. They tell us that the souls of the
impenitent do not go to Purgatory, but

to Hell, nor the souls of all Believers,
but of some only, viz. of those that did
not fully satisfie for their sins in this
life.
Q. What kind of place do they imagine
Purgatory to be?
A. A place of great pain, where the
fore-mentioned souls are tormented till
they satisfie Gods Justice, and then being
purged fully from sin, they are to be re|ceived
up into Heaven.
Q. What difference do they make be|twixt
Hell and Purgatory?
A. They say in Purgatory, the fore-mentioned
souls suffer the vengeance of
a temporary fire, but in Hell impenitent
Unbelievers suffer the vengeance of eter|nal
fire.
Q The Papists profess to believe with us,
That the blood of Iesus Christ purgeth and
cleanseth us from all our sins: Why then
have they inventd the fire of Purgatory?
If all sins are washed away, and purged by
the blood of Christ, what then remains to be
purged in this imaginary fire?
A. They mock the world in calling it
Purgatory, for (according to the Romish
Doctrine) it serves not to purge, but to
punish souls, and to satisfie Gods Justice;

so that it is not a purging, but a pain and
a punishment.
Q But can the sufferings of the fore-mentioned
Believers in Purgatory, satisfie
Gods offended Iustice, so that by the help of
the Prayers of the living and the sacrifice
of the Mass, they shall be delivered thence,
and accounted worthy to be received up into
Heaven?
A. 'Tis impossible that the sufferings
of finite and mutable Creatures, which
are but of yesterday, should satisfie the
offended Justice of the infinite, eternal
and unchangeable God: And that their
temporary torments, though never so ex|quisite,
should merit for them that far
more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory, which all shall be partakers of, that
are received up into Heaven.
Q. How may it be proved that we are
delivered from the whole punishment of
sin, temporal and Eternal, by the death of
Christ: So that we shall not need to fear
their fear, who through fear of Purga|tory-fire,
are all their life-time subject to
bondage; or be affrighted with their big
words, who are so hot for this invented
fire, as to say, Whosoever believeth not Pur|gatory
shall be tormented in Hell?
A. 1. Punishment is inflicted because
of sin, Iob 4. 8. Prov. 22. 8. and
28. 18. Hos. 10. 13. and 14. 1. Being
freed from sin, we are not liable to Judge|ment,
2 Sam. 12. 13. Ier. 4. 14. Ezek.
18. 32.
2. It stands not with the Justice of
God, being once fully satisfied, to require
a second payment at our hand. Gen.
18. 25. Isa. 53. 10, 11. Mat. 3. 17.
3. Neither will it stand with his glori|ous
Mercy. Luke 1. 77, 78. 2 Cor. 1. 3.
Rom. 9. 23. Ephes. 2. 4, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 1. 3.
Iude 21. 2 Tim. 1. 18.
4. Nor with the honour of Christ,
who is a perfect Redeemer. Tit. 2. 14.
Heb. 1. 3. 1 Ioh. 1. 7, 9. and 2. 1, 2.
5. Nor with the price of his Blood.
1. Cor. 6. 20. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. Mat. 20. 28.
1 Tim. 2. 6.
6. Nor with our Faith in praying for
full pardon of all our debts. Matth.
6. 12.
7. Nor with our peace with God.
Rom. 5. 1.
8. Nor yet with right reason, that
the guilt of sin should be removed, and
yet punishment for sin inflcted.
Q. And is not this new invented doctrine

of Purgatory contrary to the intendment and
design of the Gospel?
A. Yes, for the design of the Gospel
is to comfort Believers against all their
sufferings in this life, with the hope of hea|venly
glory and happiness, to be enjoyed
immediately after their death; see Rom.
15. 4. Io. 5. 24. 2 Cor. 5. 1, 2. 1 Thes.
4. 17. Rom. 8. 17. Phil. 1. 23. Rev. 14. 13.
Luke 23. 43. and 16. 22, 23. with Mat.
8. 11, 12. Heb. 11. 13, 16. But this
new invented Doctrine speaks terrour to
all Believers, as being so far from making
God full satisfaction for their sins in this
life (as some of them are supposed to do
by the Papists) that they were never able
to make God any satisfaction for them.
And therefore must we certainly be all
doomed alike to go to Purgatory, that
place of so great pain, that the most
torturing wheels, and the most ardent
fires are nothing in comparison of it, if
it be true (which those of that party
say) that it is ten times hotter than our
fire, and that it differs from Hell-fire,
in respect of duration only.
Q. And will not such Doctrine as this be
a great scandal, and a Rock of offence to
weak Believers, for whom Christ died?
A. Yes.
Q. But is it not the duty of every one
that nameth the name of Christ, to com|fort
the feeble-minded, and to support the
weak?
A. Yes.
Q. And do not they blaspheme that
worhy nme, by the which they are called,
that break a bruised Reed, and quench the
smoaking Flax?
A. Yes.
Q. And whoever shall offend one of these
little ones which believe in Christ; were
it not better for him that a Millstone were
hanged about his neck, and that he were
drowned in the depth of the Sea?
A. Yes.
Q Now therefore, seeing we know these
things before, should we not beware lest we
also being led away with the error of the
wicked, fall from our own stedfastness?
A. Yes.
Q. But that we may not as Children be
tossed to and fro, and carried about with
every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of
men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they
lie in wait to deceive; 'Twill highly con|cern
us to be much in reading the Scriptures,
and to use all possible means to help us to

understand the reading, because there are
some things in them hard to be understood,
which our Adversaries, the learned of them
especially, do wrest for their confirmation of
the doctrine of Purgatory, as of their other
inventions?
Object. 1. The Papists glory much in
1 Cor. 3. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Read it;
Doth this place rightly understood confirm
their Doctrine of Purgatory fire?
A. No, for if the design of the Apo|stle
be attended unto in this place, we
may with more reason call the unlevened
bread eaten in the Land of Promise by the
Israelites, the very identical bread of
affliction really eaten by their Fathers in
Egypt, as it was a sign of it; than the
fire here mentioned by the Apostle, their
material Purgatory fire, which is no sign
of any such fond invention.
Q. What therefore is the true sense
and meaning of this place?
A. If the scope of the place be ob|served,
we shall easily see the meaning of
the place to be nothing but this, viz.
That the Faith of Christ being the Foun|dation
which our Apostle had laid, and
indeed the only one which could possibly
be laid: That that which was regularly

to be built thereon was constant confes|sion
of Christ in despire of afflctions,
which like Gold and Silver, c. would
be refined and purified not consumed in
the ; but for any doctrine of world|ly
wisdom, vers. 18. of prudential com|pliancs
with the Persecutors, Jews or
Gentiles, If any such earthly material
were brought in the stead of the formen|tioned
constancy, it should be brought
suddenly to the trial; And proving com|bustible
matter, it will not bear that trial
(such are the Doctrines of denying Christ
when persecuted) and it shall be so far
from helping this Gnostick complier to
any advantage as the hopes it will, that it
shall bring the greatest danger upon him;
and if upon timely Repentance, or by
his not having actually denyed Christ
(for all his superstructing of some erro|neous
doctrines) he be more mercifully
dealt with by Christ, and freed from
having his portion with Unbelievers,
yet it shall go hard with him, as with one
that is involved in a common fire, and
hardly escapes out of it.
Object. 2. They urge also, 1 Pet. 3. 19.
By which also he went and Preached unto
the Spirits in Prison; Do you think when

this Scripture is rightly considered it will
justifie their Opinion of Purgatory fire?
A. No 1. Because the Apostle saith
that these Spirits that be in Prison, were
disobedient in the daies of Noah, vers. 20.
And the Papists themselves hold, that
disobedient and impenitent persons go to
Hell, but the Souls of Believers only to
Purgatory; so that this place is nothing
at all for Purgatory.
2. Because Christ is not said to Preach
in the Prison to the Spirits, but to the
Spirits in Prison: The difference be|twixt
these two expressions is very great;
He preached to them in the daies of Noah,
who were in Prison in the daies of the
Apostles: He Preached to them out of
Prison, that are now in Prison; which
is nothing to their purpose.
Object. 3. Mat. 12. 32. Whosoever
speaketh a word against the Son of man,
it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speak|eth
against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
forgiven him, neither in this world, nei|ther
in the world to come; Hence they argue
that some sins shall be forgiven in the world
to come.
A. Not to be forgiven in this world,
nor in the world to come, is as much as,

shall never be forgiven; so Matthew ex|plains
himself, Mat. 12. 31. And so
Mark doth express it, Mark 3. 29. Read
the places.
Oject. 4. They urge Mat. 5. 25, 26.
read the place. This Prison, saith Bellar|mine,
is Purgatory, out of which, after
the Debt is paid, the Debtor shall go
forth?
A. 1. Some understand the place lite|rally,
and if it be so understood, it is
altogether impertinent to the matter in
hand.
2. If the place be taken in a spiritual
sense, by the Prison must necessarily be
understood Hell (and not Purgatory)
whence the Debtor shall never come
forth, because no meer man by his suf|fering
can in a finite time satisfie the in|finite
offended Justice of God.
3. And that which may be an argu|ment
to them, they interpret other Scrip|tures
where they meet with the like
phrases in the same sense we understand
this very place; see Mat. 1. 25. Gen. 8. 7.
Deut. 34. 6. 1 Sam. 15. 35. and 2 Sam.
6. 23. So that in brief, in the literal
sense, it is impertinent, and in the spi|ritual
sense it must needs be understood

of Hell, whence there is no Redempti|on.
Q. How many sorts of Prayers are
there?
A. Three, viz. Closet, Family and
Publick.
Q What do you mean by Closet-Prayer?
A. Entring into our Closet alone, and
praying unto our Father in secret.
Q. Why is Closet-Prayer necessary?
A. Because those that pray after the
manner of Hypocrites, to be seen of men,
have their reward: But if, we pray to the
Father in secret, our Father which seeth
in secret, shall reward us openlyMat. 6. 5, 6
Q. And must we in our Closet-Prayers
pray both for our selves and others?
A. YesMat. 6 5, 6 with vers 9.
Q. When you say you are to pray for
others, what do you mean by it?
A. That we ought to pray for all in
the Land of the living (which is the
only Land of hope) yea, though they
be the greatest sinners, and such Prisoners
as are bound with the bands and setters
of their sins; they are Prisoners of
hope, if they have not sinned the sin unto
death; and we ought to pray for them.
Q. What do you mean by Family-Prayer?
A. Praying in and with our Families
for our selves and others.
Q. Why ought we to pray in our Fa|milies?
A. Because God will pour out his fury
upon the Families that call not on his
Name, as having on them the mark
and brand of the accursed Heathens,
Ier. 10. 25.
Q. What mean you by Publick-Prayer?
A. Praying in and with the publick
Assemblies for our selves and others.
Q. Ought not publick prayer to be pre|ferred
above all Family-private-prayer?
A. Yes, because every particular Be|liever
hath special interest and power
with God, and doth prevail with him
for all desireable blessings; and a multi|tude
of Believers assembled together in
publick, will have a greater interest and
power with God in Prayer, than a few
met together in a private Family: And
therefore publick-prayer ought to be and
will be preferred by all that regard their
own interest, above any Family-private-prayer
whatsoever.
Q. Whom doth the Preface of the Lords
Prayer teach us to pray unto?
A. To our Father who is in Heaven.
Q. And do we by this appellation ex|press
our reverence to him, and our Faith in
him, that his Goodness, Will, and his
Power can grant our requests for our selves
and others?
A. Yes.
Q. But when mention is made of the
Father, do you exclude the Son, or the
Holy Ghost from being prayed unto?
A. No.
Q How and in what order are we to di|rect
our Prayers to the persons of the blessed
Trinity? And whether may we not single
out any one of the Persons, to whom we
may direct more immediately such or such
a Prayer?
A. The case hath so much difficulty in
it, that a short answer must not be ex|pcted
to so great questions, as are
couched in it; yet we will endeavour to
give an answer thereunto, as briefly as
we can in these following Conclusions:
Some of which will be of use to us as
rules of direction to lead us into the
sound knowledge of these and other
mysteries of the Gospel.
1. That in all parts of divine worship,
and so in this of Prayer, the Trinity in
Unity, and Unity in Trinity is to be
worshipped and respected. Or, That
we ought so to think of God in Prayer
as one in Essence, yet three in Persons:
and so as three in Persons, that he is but
one in Essence.
2. That we ought so to think in Prayer
of some one Person in the Trinity, as
thereby to be led to the other two: The
Father being in the Son, and the Son in
the Father, and the Holy Ghost in them
bothJoh. 14. 9, 10, 16, 17 and 15. 26 Isa. 48. 16.
3. That in order, we are first to di|rect
our Prayers to the blessed Father;
yet not as first, or chief in honour and
dignity above the other two, but as first
in order of subsisting: according as the
Scripture in two places, where the order
of the blessed Persons is set down, the
Father is first set down in order of wit|nessing,
1 Ioh. 5. 7. and invocation and
worship, Mat. 28. 19.
4. In singling out any one Person in
the blessed Trinity, we are to pitch most
usually on the Father, as he to whom we
direct our Prayers through the mediation
of Christ, and by the help of the Holy

Ghost: That is the Rule and method
prescribed by Christ, to ask the Father in
his Name, Ioh. 16. 23. and suitable is
and hath been the usual practice of the
Saints: And yet in such directings of
Prayers most what as to the Father in the
general intention of their Spirits, do the
Saints mind and eye the other two Per|sons,
and include them as joyntly wor|shipped;
and therefore in their Prefaces
of Prayer they do oftimes mention ex|presly,
that blessed God one in Essence,
yet three in Persons, as he to whom they
speak; and in the close they subscribe
glory to the blessed Father, Son and Spi|rit,
three Persons yet one God, c.
5. We may single out the Son of God,
the Lord Jesus Christ, as he to whom we
occasionally present some special request,
either by way of Apostrophe, whilst we
are directing our Prayers to the Father,
or in way of Ejculation: as did Stephen,
Acts 7. 59. Lord Iesus receive my Spirit.
And so in the instance of that short
prayer of the Converted Thief, Luke
23. 42. Lord, remember me when thou
comest into thy Kingdom; and so in that
short Prayer of Iacob's, The Angel which
redeemed me from all evil, bless the Lads,

Gen. 48. 16. this Angel was Christ:
And in more continued and solemn man|ner
did Abraham pray to that Angel,
Gen. 18. To him did Iacob pray again,
and make supplication, by the space al|most
of the whole night, and had power
over him, Gen. 32. from Verse 24. to
the end, compared with Hos. 12. 3, 4.
And the Reasons hereof are evident,
1. Because Prayer is a divine worship
of God as GodActs 5. 4; and therefore due to
the Son, and so to the Holy Ghost as well
as to the Father. Rom. 10. 13, 14.
2. We are Baptized into the Name of
the Son, and the Holy Ghost, as well as
into the Name of the Father: and there|fore
both the Son and the Holy Ghost
may be particularly and personally invo|cated,
and worshipped as well as the
FatherJoh. 14. 1.
3. We are to believe in the Son, and
so in the Holy Ghost as well as in the
Father, and that personally and particu|larly:
and therefore so are to pray to ei|ther.
That which the Apostle expound|eth
of the Gentiles trusting in Christ,
Rom. 15. 12. the Prophet expressed of
their seeking to him, Isa. 11. 10. So that
they are inseparably due to one and the

same Christ, upon one and the same
ground; see Rom. 10. 13, 14. before
mentioned. It is supposed that he on
whom men call, he must be believed on,
or else he cannot be called upon by any;
and when the Apostle in the 13. Verse,
mentions the Name of the Lord, as that
which is called upon, he in Verse 14.
expounds it to be meant of the Lord
himself: to call upon the Lords Name,
is to call upon himself.
4. The Lord Jesus promiseth that he
will do what we ask, Ioh. 16. 23, 24.
and therefore he may be sought to do the
same; and indeed he proveth himself to
be equal with the Father by this argu|ment,
because Petitions shall not only be
granted in his Name, but by him: Nei|ther
doth he make account that this is any
disparagement to the Father, but a glori|fying
of him, and therefore when he
saith, Iob. 17. 1. Father glorifie thy Son,
he immediately adds, that thy Son also
may glorifie thee. What is said to prove
that in our Prayers we may single out the
Son of God, may serve to prove the
same may be done to the Holy Ghost.
Obj. Against this which hath been said, it
may be objected, we are to ask all we do ask in

the Name of Christ; and therefore how can
we be said to ask him, or Pray to him?
A. 1. The Lord Jesus Christ is asked
or prayed unto in that prayer that is put
up to the Father in his Name, Iob. 16 23.
Christ speaking of the time after his Re|surrection
and Ascension, saith, In that
day ye shall ask me nothing: or (which
is all one) Verily, ye shall ask the Fa|ther
nothing in my Name, but be will give
it you. He is glorified as God, in that
all is done with God in his Name, and
for his Father. For albeit it be some|times
said, For Abraham and David's
sake God will do this or that; yet this
is meant in reference to Gods Covenant
of Grace with them, and so to Christ
properly, in whom that Covenant is ra|tified,
Gal. 3. 17. They called on the
Name of the Lord Iesus Christ in every
place, 1 Cor. 1. 2. Yet surely they brake
not that Rule, Iob. 16. 23. They called
on the Father in Christs Name, even in
their calling upon God in his Name:
and Christ as God is also called upon,
in that his Father as God is called
upon.
2. In all external worship of God,
one Person of the Trinity being Named,

the other are understood, and are not to
be excluded: the Trinity being undi|vided
in worship.
3. If Christ be considered as the Son
of God in Essence with the Father, He
is he to whom we come, c. Coming
in Prayer to the Father: If considered as
Mediator, God incarnate, God and Man,
He is he by whom we come to the Father,
Heb. 7. 25. and 1 Tim. 2. 5. As the Son
of God, He may be, he must be prayed
to, which is God and Man in one Person;
but is not prayed to as Man, but as
God.
Q. 2. What are those Petitions which
you offer up to God the Father, Son and
Holy Ghost?
A. They are Six: In the three first
we more immediately respect Gods
glory; in the three last our own good.
Q. 101. What do we pray for in the
first Petition?
A. In the first Petition [which is,

Q. 107. What doth the Conclusion of
the Lords Prayer teach us?

and Power, and Glory to him; And in
testimony of our desire, and assurance to
be heard, we say Amen.
Explic. Q. What is the Conclusion of
the Lords Prayer?
A. For thine is the Kingdom, and
the Power, and the Glory for ever,
Amen.

give us what he pleaseth?
A. YesDan. 4. 32, 34, 35.
Q And that the Power is Gods, and
therefore he can do according to and above
all our necessities, let our case be what it
will?
A. YesGen. 17. 1.
Q. And that the Glory belongs to God,
and therefore we are encouraged from the
glorious excellencies of his nature to expect,
and for the furtherance and promoting of
his own honour to desire the fulfilling of
our requests?
A. YesDan. 4. 36, 37.
Q. What else doth the Conclusion teach
us?
A. It teacheth us in our Prayers to
Praise him, or to joyn praises to our
Prayers, by ascribing Kingdom, Po|wer

praise God?

Q. And why do we say [Amen] as
the Conclusion of this and of all our Prayers?
A. In testimony of our desire and as|surance
to be heard.
Q Is that then the meaning of our
saying, Amen, in the close of our Prayers;
So let it be, and so it shall be, as such
phrases imply both earnestness in desiring,
and confidence of speeding?
A. YesPsal. 20. 5 Isa. 26. 9 2 Cor. 1. 20 Mat. 21 22 Eph. 3. 20, 21.



The Creed.
I Believe in God the Father Almighty
maker of Heaven and Earth: And
in Iesus Christ his only Son our Lord,
who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,
born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under
Pontius Pilate, was Crucified, dead and
buried, he descended intoThat is, Continued in the state of the dead, and under the power of Death till the third day. Hell, the
third day he rose again from the dead,
he ascended into Heaven, and sitteth on
the right hand of God the Father Al|mighty,
from thence he shall come to
judge the quick and the dead: I believe
in the Holy Ghost, the holy Catholick
Church, the Communion of Saints, the
forgiveness of Sins, the Resurrection of
the Body, and the Life Everlasting. Amen.



The Ten Com|mandments.
Exodus 20.
GOD spake all these words, saying,
I am the Lord thy God, which
have brought thee out of the Land of
Egypt, out of the House of Bondage.
1. Thou shalt have no other Gods before
me.
2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any
graven Image, or any likeness of any
thing that is in Heaven above, or that is
in the Earth beneath, or that is in the Water
under the Earth: Thou shalt not bow down
thy self to them, not serve them: For I
the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting
the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Chil|dren,
unto the third and fourth Generation
of them that hate me: and shewing mercy
unto thousands of them that love me and
keep my Commandments.
3. Thou shalt not take the Name of the
Lord thy God in vain: For the Lord will
not hold him guiltless that taketh his Name
in vain.
4. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it
holy: Six daies shalt thou labour and do all
thy work: but the seventh day is the Sab|bath
of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt
not do any work, thou, nor thy Son, nor
thy Daughter, thy Man-servant, nor thy
Maid-servant, nor thy Cattle, nor thy
Stranger that is within thy Gates: For
in six daies the Lord made Heaven and
Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and
rested the Seventh day; wherefore the Lord
blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.
5. Honour thy Father and thy Mother,
that thy daies may be long upon the Land
which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
6. Thou shalt not Kill.
7. Thou shalt not commit Adultery.
8. Thou shalt not Steal.
9. Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy Neighbour.
10. Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbours
House, thou shalt not covet thy Neighbours
Wife, nor his Man-Servant, nor his Maid-Servant,
nor his Ox, nor his Ass, nor any
thing that is thy Neighbours.



The Lords Prayer.
Matth. 6.
OVR Father which art in Heaven,
Hallowed be thy Name. Thy King|dom
come. Thy Will be done on Earth as
it is in Heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread. And forgive us our Debts as
we forgive our Debtors. And lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us from evil:
For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power,
and the Glory for ever. Amen.



Acts 8. 30.
Understandest thou what thou readest?
GOD avouched Israel to be his pecu|liar
people; In Iudah is God known,
his Name is great in Israel.Deut. 26. 18 Psal. 76. 1 God erected
a partition-wall between the Jew and the
Gentile;Acts 10. 35 but Christ took it down, And
now in every Nation be that feareth God,
and worketh righteousness is accepted with
him.Gen. 9, and 10 And this Ethiopian Eunuch, al|though
of the Line of cursed Ham, be|comes
a Believer upon Philip's Preaching
to him Jesus.1 Cor. 1. 26 We see how that not many
wise men after the flesh, not many mighty,
not many noble are called: Yet there
are some of the most Noble, and Officers
of great honour and trust, whom God
is pleased to call over to himself. Of
this chosen and royal Priesthood, whom
God called out of darkness into his mar|vellous
light, were David, Solomon, Ie|hshaphat.
You may read David's con|quests,
2 Sam. 8. and 10. Chapters; So|lomon's
honour, 2 Chron. 1. 12. How the

Realm of Iehoshaphat was quiet, for his
God gave him rest round about, 2 Chron.
17. 6. and 20. 30. And you see of what
Authority this Eunuch was under Can|dace
Queen of the Ethiopians, Verse 27.
The Law is our School-master to bring us
unto Christ:Gal. 3. 24 Yea even Proselytism it self is
here an Introduction to such a blessing.
Philip had a Vision, and therein an Angel
from Heaven spake unto him, to go to|wards
the South, unto the way that go|eth
down from Ierusalem to Gaza, which
is desart; where he light on the Ethiopian
Eunuch, Vers. 26, 27. And finding him
studious of the way of God, reading the
Evangelical Prophet, vers. 28. by pro|phetick
divine efflation, or revelation he
is directed to go near to the Chariot, and
speak to him, vers. 28. The which he did
with the greatest readiness, running to
the Chariot, and there hearing him read
Esaias the Prophet, said to him in the
words of the Text, Vnderstandest thou
what thou readest? Which words we may
call the Deacons serious profitable question
to the Eunuch with set purpose (accord|ing
to the guidance of Gods Spirit) to
be an Interpreter unto him. The division
of the words would be more curious than
useful.
That every sincere serious Christian
that doth in good earnest look after the
Salvation of his Soul will diligently read
the holy Scriptures, is here to be supposed,
as implied in the godly practice of this
Eunuch: the Doctrinal truth to be insisted
upon as more express is this,
Doct. That we ought not to content our
selves with the bare reading of the holy Scrip|tures,
but should labour to understand what
we read of them. And here you have, 1. The
proof of this Doctrine. 2. Some Rules for
the better understanding the holy Scriptures.
3. The Application.
1. This Doctrine is proved
1. By the practice of the Church of
God in all Ages: Read Neh. 8. 8. and
this practice was not abrogated by Christ
or his Apostles, but ratified and confirm|ed.
Christ expounded to the two Disci|ples
that went to Emaus in all the Scrip|tures,Luk. 24. 27 Luk. 4. 16, to the 22.
the things concerning himself. And
you find Christ reading the Book of Esaias
the Prophet, and expounding that Scrip|ture
of himself, as that day fulfilled in
their ears by his Preaching to them. You
find the Apostle Iames alledges this, why
they should not require or force them to
be Circumcised, who from Gentiles turn|ed

Christians; for Acts 15. 21. saith he,
Moses of old hath in every City them that
Preach him, being read in the Synagogues
every Sabbath day. As if he had said Nor
need we Jews to fear that this will bring
a contempt upon Moses, or our Law;
For the contrary appears by the Christian
practice, even where these Proselytes of
the Gentiles are, there the Books of Moses,
as hath been customary from of old, are
still continued among them, to be read
aloud in the Synagogue every Saturday,
(to which the Council of Laodica did af|ter
add the reading of a Chapter in the
New Testament) to signifie their respect
to the Mosaical Law, and their not of|fering
it contempt among the Proselytes,
though they did not require them to be
Circumcised: And Acts 13. 15, c.
you may read Paul's approbation, con|tinuation,
and recommendation of this
laudable custom to us by his own practice.
And that all Nations may be taught our
of the holy Scriptures the things that are
commanded them of Christ,Mat. 8. 19, 0 he hath pro|mised
his special presence with Ministers
unto the end of the world. Now to him
that shall Question this in our daies, I
shall give him the two Disciples answer

to Christ; art thou only a stranger in Ie|rusalem,
and hast not known the things
which have been, and are of ordinary
practice with us every Lords day?
2. By the command of God, Ioh. 5. 39.
with Prov 2. 4, 5. Till I come give atten|dance
to reading, to Exhortation, to Do|ctrine,
i. e. Betwixt this and the time of
my coming to thee, see thou be diligent
in performing thy office in the several parts
of it, expounding the Scriptures, con|firming
Believers, and admonishing them
of any fault or danger, and instructing
the ignorant or unbelievers.
Some few Rules for the better under|standing,
and our more profitable read|ing
the holy Scriptures: And these are
either Antecedent, Concomitant, or Sub|sequent.

1. Antecedent Rules.
1. We must pray and beg of God wis|dom
to understand the Scriptures.Jam. 1. 5 Psa. 119. 18 We
must pray with David, that God would
open our eyes, that we may behold won|drous
things out of his Law. We must
pray that God would acquaint us with
the mysterie of the Gospel; For if the

Gospel be hid,2 Cor. 4. 7 it is hid to those that are
lost.
2. We must lay aside all vain conceit of
our own wisdom, be humble and hearken
to God alone, speaking in the Scripturs.
God hath so disposed the way to Heaven,
that the most ignorant and most humble,
not the most illuminate and most proud,
shall be most ready to receive and em|brace
the Gospel.Mat. 11. 25
And we must account our own wisdom
foolishness,2 Cor. 3.  that we may know the holy
Scriptures, which are able to make us
wise unto Salvation. We must lie low in
the fight and sense of our own ignorance,
arguing thus with our selves; Have we
lived so long, and read the Scriptures so
often, and know so little of them! Let
us thus be wail our ignorance, for the hum|ble
God will teach. The rain falls upon
the Rock, but rests not there, that it
may make the Valleys fruitful: Divine
heavenly wisdom will not rest upon a
proud heart, but will enrich the lowly
with its treasures.
We must hearken to God alone, speak|ing
in the Scriptures. Humanum est er|rare,
there is no infallible Judge upon
Earth. If any man Preach any other Do|ctrine

unto us, than that we have received
from the Canonical Scriptures,Gl. 1. 9 let him
be accursed. If Pope or Council, or Pope
and General Council agreeing together, de|cree
or determine any thing against or be|sides
the holy Scriptures; Let God be
True, and every man a Lyar, in this case
we are not to attend to a Thus faith a Fa|ther,
or a Pope, or Council, c. but to
a Thus saith the Lord.
3. We must go to the Scriptures with|out
prejudice. Non reerendus est sensus,
sed auferendus; We must not bring but
take our sense from the Scriptures; lest
we wrest them to our own destruction.
Take care no body plunder you, rob you
of all that you have, your principles of
Christian knowledge through Philosophy,
or by such vain, empty, frothy, pre|tended
knowledge and wisdom which the
Gnosticks of old talked so much of,Col. 2. 8 taken
out of Pythagoras; together with the ob|servances
of the Mosaical Law, and very
distant and contrary to Christian Divinity.
4. We must go to the Scriptures with
a mind purified by Faith and Repentance,Mark 1. 15 2 Tim. 3. 8 Jam. 1. 21 Isa. 55 1, 2, 3
and in which is the study of Piety. We
must lay aside all filthiness and superfluity
or naughtiness when we go to the waters
of life.
5. We must go with reverence and love
of the truth. We must go with reve|rence
to the holy Scriptures,1 Thes 2 13 because of
their Author and matter. We must go to
the Scriptures as to the Oracles of God
and the Laws of Heaven; the which we
must stand in awe of, and be subject to
for Conscience sake. We must go with
the love of the truth although it be against
flesh and blood, and thwart and contra|dict
self and carnal interest in the world.
The want of this love of the truth, is
given as the reason of that fatal miscarri|age
of the Gnosticks,2 Thes. 2 0 those carnal Chri|stians.
6. We must go to the Scriptures with
full purpose of heart to do the Will of
God, Ioh. 7. 17. 2 Tit. 11. 12. Luk. 11. 28.
The fear of the Lord is a step to wisdom,
Psal. 111. 10. Prov. 1. 7. Quia finis
Scripturae non est nuda scientia, sed praxis.


2. Concomitant Rules.
1. Non est recedendum  litera legis abs
summa necessitate. When the words of
Scripture may, without any incommodi|ty
or incongruiy, be taken properly, and
as they sound and lie in the Text, they

ought to be so taken: neither are they
to be inflcted to metaphors,Nunquam ad matapho|ras fugi|ndum est si|ne necessita|te. B or other
Tropes, or improper senses, unless when
out of the words taken properly some
absurd interpretations should from thence
be elicited, Aug. Hence it follows that
they are the best Interpreters, who most
promptly and apertly manifest the native
and genuine sense. In which part with|out
boasting it may be said that the Pro|testants
exceed the Papists and carry
away the Palm: Because their Interpre|ters
are wont , as Oc|cumenius
saith in Eph. 5. to evert the pro|priety
of speech, and to turn all things
into the uncertain conjectures of Allego|ries.
That what Epiphanius in Nicolaitis
said of Origen, we may say of them,
, Allegorice expli|ct
quicquid potest; He allegorized what|soever
he could. Indeed it is said that he
interpreted literally Matthew 19. 12. and
in the same sense became an Eunuch him|self:
And so the Papists in like manner
interpret mostly in the Allegorie, excep|ting
that known place, This is my Body,
with a far greater and more dangerous
mistake than that of Origen's, of that kind
of Eunuchs.
But this Head is too general to be laid
down without some necessary cautions:
Take these few,
1. Augustini Regula tenenda est, lib. 3.
de doctrina Christiana, Cap. 5, 10, and 11.
Cavendum est n figuratam locutionem ad
literam accipiamus:  vice versa, n locutio
propria in figuratum sensum torqueatur.
Let's take heed of taking figures literally,
and of wresting the proper sense into fi|gures.
2. It is to be supposed that some places
of Scripture are true, both in the Type
and Antitype, both in the literal and
mystical sense. And, Verba sacrae Scrip|turae
sunt praegnantia, pariunt gemellos 
sensum geminum admittunt. The words
of Scred Writ are pregnant with matter,
very fruitful, and sometimes bear twins
and admit a double sense: And 'tis an
unerring Rule in Divinity; Scripture is
alwaies to be expounded in the largest
sense; unless there be in or about the Text
some particular restriction to limit it;
and thus those words,Psal. 109 8 and Acts 1 20. Let another take
his Office, are true both of Doeg and
Iudas.
3. It is to be observed, that in Prophe|cies
some particulars agree to the Type,

and not to the Truth; some to the Truth,
and not to the Type; or to the Type in
one sense, to the Truth in another. Take
this Head because somewhat large in its
particular branches.
1. Some particulars agree to the Type
and not to the Truth. Psal. 40. 12.
2. Some to the Truth, and not to the
Type. Psal. 16. 10. with Acts 2. 29.
and 13. 35, 36, 37.
3. Or to the Type in one sense, and to
the Truth in another. So in those Psalms
wherein David is a Type of Christ: As
Psal. 2. and 16. and 22. and those in
which Solomon; as psal. 45. and 72.
Some things are spoken that must of ne|cessity
be understood of them in one No|tion;
of Christ in another. Of Pha|raoh's
Daughter espoused to Solomon;
and the Church to Christ; the one typi|fied
by the other, Psal. 45. the same
may be said. Gatak. in Isa. 42.
But how may we know when we are
to interpret in the literal, and when in
the mystical sense?
These three Rules will in some mea|sure
direct us.
1. The first is Augustines golden Rule,
Si praeceptiva locutio est aut flagitium aut

facinus vetans, c. If it be a precept for|bidding
any lewdness, or commanding
something profitable or beneficial, there
is no figure in the words, Take, eat,1 Cor. 11. 24, 25
this do in remembrance of me. This do ye,
as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
Indeed, This is my Body, c. cannot be
taken in the literal sense, for the reasons
to be mentioned afterwards; But take,
eat, c. because a preceptive speech,
and commanding a necessary profitable
duty, and I am afraid a much neglected
duty too, we are not to suppose a figure
in the words. If there be sins ofPlura sunt peccata pri|vativa quam posi|tiva. Omission,
as without controversie there are; then
those who have not communicated in this
Ordinance, or not frequently, cannot but
be found guilty of a dangerous sinful neg|lect.
Nothing but ignorance and Pha|naticism
in the most proper and literal
sense can turn this divine precept into an
Allegory. Some are so fond as to think
that this Precept imports no more than
feeding upon Christ out of and in con|tempt
of this Sacrament: Such self-con|ceited
Gnosticks cannot rationally expect
the Churches welcom, Eat O Friends,
drink, yea drink abundantly, O be|loved.
And if ever such Spiritualists

were really fed by Christ, they were no
doubt better fed than taught. But if
any man seem to be contentious, we
have not so learned Christ, neither the
Churches of God.
2. When the Text taken properly af|fords
a fit sense, nor doth ought appear
in the Context, or other places collated
that may cross it, it is not safe running
into metaphorical senses. And thus we
understand those Buyers and Sellers,
whom our Saviour cast out of the Tm|ple,
Mat. 21. 12. in the Letter, and not
in the Allegory; although some Novel|lists
of our times, giving way to their
own luxuriant fancies, have turned this,
and all the History of the Gospel into a
mysterie, or rather a groundless conceit
of their own brains.
3. Indeed when the words taken in
the Letter are absurd and contradictory
to sense and reason, we must of necessity
apply our selves to the figurate sense.
And surely he is bruitish and hath not
the understanding of a man, that will
Interpret against all sense and reason.
Reason doth not contradict sense, nor
Faith reason, but only correct them when
they exercise themselves in great matters,

and in things too high for them, and
beyond their Sphear: And 'tis fit that
sense should give place to reason, and
reason to Faith; as it did in Abraham's
case, who, Rom 4. 18. [against Hope,
or rather beyond Hope] (as the words
may be better rendred) i. e. above all
causes, arguments and appearances of
natural Hope, such as reason and humane
understanding could afford or reach to
[believed in Hope] i. e. in Hope ground|ed
upon the truth and power of God.
For although there be in Scripture,1 Pet. 3. 16
, some things hard to be un|derstood,
yet there is nothing in it re|pugnant
to right reason. Although in
this life and imperfect state, we see
, through a glass
darkly, and do know , but in
part; And, Quoad nos, there may not
alwaies be ratio rei (creditae) yet there
is alwaies ratio credendi; Because infinite
wisdom cannot be deceived, and infinite
goodness will not deceive. And accord|ing
to the forementioned Rules, we may
be satisfied against the Papists literal in|terpretation
of that known place, This
is my Body.
1. Because the letter is contrary and
repugnant to our senses; which the
Scripture it self intimates to be of infal|lible
certainty.
2. It is absurd and contradictive of
right reason.
3. There appears much in the context
to cross it, nothing at all to countenance
it.
4. Because other places collated, ex|presly
thwart and contradict it.
2. Rule. Let the fuller Scripture make
out the shorter. We must compare the
shorter place with the larger, i. e. the
place that speaks but briefly of a thing,
with some other that speaks of it more
at large, common observation tells us,
that 'tis not the right method to read ab|stracts
first; because though they be fuller
of matter, they are fuller likewise of
obscurity. And sometimes that of the
learned Bacon proves true, That Epito|mes
are the corruptions and moths of
Histories. Epitomes give us the substance
of a matter; but full Narratives must
clear it up to us, with all its due circum|stances.
A compendium gives us the
Quintessence; Vertue, Force and Spirit
of a thing; but the History at large is

necessary to the right understanding of it.
3. Let the clearer Scripture clear the
obscurer. We must compare the ob|scurer
with the clearer, i. e. if any
place occur which is more obscure, but
elsewhere propounded to us in words
that are more clear; we must have re|course
to it to clucidte the ormer. We
must compare Moses with the Prophets:
Of all the Prophets Esaias speaks most
clearly, who is therefore stiled the Evan|gelical
Prophet, and seems rather to
write the History than the Prophecie of
Christ. We must compare the Old Te|stament
with the New: In the Nw
Testament the Book of the Revelations
is deemed (by those Interpreters that
are wise unto sobriety, and not above
what is written) to stand in most need
of interpretation by the other written
Revelations. The Sacred Scriptures are
written very much historically; the Do|ctrines
being interspersed with the Histo|ry.
Some Eyangelists speak more clear|ly
than others; some most clearly of
one part of the History of Christ, some
of another; that all of them collated
(without conspiring together by a con|trived
design) might give us the com|pleat

History of Christ. That you may
see the usefulness of this Rule, consult
Ioh. 16. 16, 17, 18. with 28, 29 verses
compared together.
4. Let that Scripture determine the
point that intends it. You must com|pare
Scripture with Scripture, and you
must compare them aright; compare the
place that speaks, ex casu, occasionally
of a matter, with some other, where it
is the main design of the place. This
Rule is to be attended unto in the Expo|sition
of Parables: For, if we be strict
observers of all by-passages in them; in|stead
of Milk, we shall wring till blood
cometh. We must remember that Alle|gories
must not be strained too much,
and that similitudes aswer not in all
Lines, but in the chiefest. Read for
this purpose Luke 16.
5. Out of the scope and intention of
the writer is often collected the sense of
his words. And the scope of the writer
may be guessed at by the following cir|cumstances,
viz. Quorsum, quibus, con|tra
quos, quae, ex cujus person; Why,
to whom, against whom or what,
of whose prson, he writes, which
last circumstance clears most pas|sages,

relating to the Eunuchs Qesti|on.
6. Compare Antecedents and conse|quents
in the place, whose sense is dubi|ous,
and it will much conduce to the
right understanding of it. Where there
is not light enough in the Text, there
may be a light shining round about it,
in the Context, to enlighten it.
7. Negatives are more extensive than
affirmatives. Affirmativa non valent ubi|que
ad semper, negativa ubique; or thus,
Affimativa valent semper, negativa ad
semper. When God saith, Pray; it is
alwaies true, while in this probtion|stae,
that we must pray; but it is not true
that we must pray alwaies, i.. do nothing
but pray: But when 'tis said, Thou shalt,
not Kill, c. This is our duty at all times,
there is no time wherein 'tis lawful to
Kill, commit Adultery, c.
8. Let an exception straiten and nar|row
a general Rule.Jer. 44 14, 27, 28 Mat. 19. 6 with 9. Exceptio firmat Re|gulam
in non exceptis, terminum praescribit
in exceptis. An exception confirms the
Rule in things not excepted, and bounds
it against the rest.
9. Non est distinguendum, ubi Lex
non distingui. We must not distinguish

where the Law doth not warrant it.
In Christ Iesus neither Circumcision avail|eth
any thing,Gal. 6. 15 nor uncircumcision, but a
new Creature. If this Rule be attended
unto, we shall easily understand how
nice the distinctions of Conformity and
non-conformity are, and how unavailable
either of them will be in attaining Salva|tion
for us without a reformed life.
10. We must carefully distinguish of
the Scripture, which speaks of the growth
of the Church, from that which speaks
of the infancy of it. And thus, as for
the Discipline of the Church of En|gland,
our English Reformers considered
what it was in the purest times of the
first good Christ an Emperours, when the
Church was in its growth: For the times
of Persecution in the infancy of the Church
(before temporal Princes embraced the
Christian Faith) as they were most ex|cellent
times for doctrine and manners;
so very unproper and unfit for a Pattern
or example of outward Government and
Policy. And doubtless, that Govern|ment
is most excellent, both in the com|munity
as Christian, and in the special
notion as reformed, that keepeth the
middle way between the Pomp of super|stitious

Tyranny, and the meanness of
Phanatick Anarchy: And this can be no|thing
else, but a wl regulated moderate
Episcopacy, according to this Rule.
11. That which the Scripture holds
forth at all times, must not be prejudiced
by what may take in one particular case:
although, Necessitas est jus temporis, Ne|cessity
be a Law in its time. This is a
Rule at all times, Borrow and pay again:
This must not be prejudiced by that of
the Israelites borrowing of the Egyptians.
This must not determine, Ehud destroyed
Eglon, therefore thou shalt kill, because 'tis
not safe arguing from particulars to gene|ral
duties.
12. Out of the Tradition and Inter|pretation
of the truly Catholick Church,
out of the consent of the Fathers; and
of these, either of many or of few of
them when eminent for sanctity or learn|ing;
out of the unanimous conspiration
of Doctors and Interpreters, the true
and literal sense of Holy Writ may be
often cleared up unto us.
By universal Tradition is meant, Quod
ab omnibus, quod ubique, quod semper re|ceptum
fuit. What all the Churches of
Christ in all places, have ever successively

received, that is universal Tradition;
and he is no true Catholick that doth
not receive it. Where there is a Catho|lick
consent and harmony to bear witness
to any Interpretation, and that sense is
universally and solemnly accepted; as it
will seem a wilful errour to dprt from
it, and to choose solitary and dangerous
by-paths, where the open road is so free
and safe; so what can be expected in
such singularity, but many absurdities,
and implications, and violences offered to
the word and truth?
13. We must interpret according to
the Analogy of Faith.Rom. 12. 6 2 Tim. 1. 13 We must hold
fast the form of sound words. Examine
the Interpretations of the holy Scriptures
by those three Forms, the Creed, the ten
Commandments, and the Lords Prayer.
Mistake not, you are not to examine the
Scriptures by any thing else, nor the
sense of them neither by any Creed far|ther
than it contains it self within the
very terms verbal or real of the holy
Scriptures themselves. But as the Creed
contains it self within such terms, we
are to hold it fast as a form of sound
words. And as by the ten Command|ments,
we may discern what are the

words of God, and what are the Com|mandment
of men; and by the Lords
Prayer, what Petitions we are to put up
to God, and what Prayers we are to say
Amen to: so by the Creed we may know
what doctrines are of God, and what
of men: And let what will be pretend|ed,
if any man teach otherwise, and
consent not to these wholesom words;
he is proud, knowing nothing, he is of
a corrupt mind, and rprobate concern|ing
the Faith.
I shall conclude this Head in the words
of judicious Mr. Calvin, Expertus pridem
sum,  quidem saepius, quicunque de ver|bis
pertinacius litigant, fovere occultum vi|rus;
ut magis expediat eos ultro provcare
qum in eorum gratiam obscurius loqui:
Ad the liberty of not using the very
words of Scripture on some occasions,
hath ever been accounted lawful in the
Church of Christ; and is at some times
very necessary for the obviating of grow|ing
Heresies.
Where all these Helps are either want|ing,
or do not avail us, as to some par|ticulars
and single clauses, not so necessa|ry
to be known; The Hebrew and Greek
Idiotisms (elegancies or proprieties)

may possibly guide us to the true and
genuine sense and interpretation.


3. Subsequent Rules.
1. We must pray again.Aug. Orationi lectio,
lectioni succedat Oratio. We must pray
and read, read and pray again.
2. We must mediae upon the Scrip|tures
we have read and understood, and
that sometimes will lead us into the true
meaning of those which in our course of
reading we understand not: For Scrip|ture
will give light to Scripture.
3. We must both before and after our
reading the holy Scriptures, get the gui|dance
of Gods holy Spirit. Methinks I
hear God saying to each of you that are
much in reading the oy criptures,
Vnderstand you what you read? And you
again saying to God, How can we, except
thy holy Spirit guide us! Ask my be|loved
in our Lord Iesus Christ, and it shall
be given, Luk. 11. 9, 13.
Suffer the word of Exhortation; You
that are much in reading the holy Scrip|tures;
content not your selves with
bare reading, but in the use of all at|tainable

means endeavour to under|stand
what you read of them.
To perswade hereunto take these two
Motives.
1. The bare reading of the holy
Scriptures will be unprofitable to you.
It will be to you as he that speaketh in
an unknown tongue,1 Cor. 14. 2, 9, 14 whom none of
you understandeth; or as he that
speaketh into the air, whose speech
is unfruitful. Indeed the Scripture is
the Water of life, but to you the
fountain is sealed. It is as the Garden
of the Lord; But behold Cherubims, and
a flaming Sword,Gen. 3. 24 which turneth every
way, to keep the way of the Tree of
Life. You are kept out of this Garden,
while you are kept ignorant of the
true sense and meaning of the Scrip|ture,
which is as the Soul and Life of
it. It is a Vision, but the Vision be|cometh
to you as the words of a
Book that is Sealed, which men deliver
to one that is learned, saying, Read
this I pray thee; and he saith, I can|not,
for it is Sealed. By what hath
in brief been said, you see that the
bare unintelligent reading of the holy

Scriptures themselves,Isa. 44. 10 is in this like a
a Graven Image which we are sure is
profitable for nothing.
2. But contrariwise, if you under|stand
what you read, the Scripture of
all writings, will be the most profia|ble
unto you, 2 Tim. 3. 16. 'Tis by
way of eminency called The Scripture, as
the Original first writing, as the hand|writing
of God.
It is in Genere materiae, sufficient to
save our souls. It is as that Tree menti|oned,Psal. 19. and 119.
Rev. 22. 2. which bare twelve
manner, and yielded her fruit every
moneth; and the leaves of the Tree
were for the healing of the Nation.
There is more weight in one Sentence of
Scripture than in all Orations, Declama|tions,
Poets, Satyrs, and Philosophick
invectives. It was a wise observation of
Scaliger, that some passages in Plato are
wiser than their Authour, and many ex|cellent
conceits are recollected from Ho|mer
and Aristotle they never dreamed of:
But in the Word of God it is quite con|trary,
for after all the recollections that
have been made by the most acute Sages of
the world; we must say with the Queen

of Sheba in another case, the one half
hath not been told us. I shall therefore
conclude this Exhortation and Discourse
in the words of holy and learned Baxter,
As you love your Comfort, your Faith,
your Hope, your Safety, your Innocency,
your Souls, your Christ, your Everlasting
Rest; Love, Reverence, Read, Search,
Study, Obey, and stick close to the Scrip|tures.
FINIS.
