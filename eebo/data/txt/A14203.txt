 of the Indians fort or Palizado in NEW ENGLAND  of the destroying  Ctayne Vnderhill  Catayne Mason.







Newes from America, or a late and experimentall discoverie of New England.
_I Shall not spend time (for my other occasions will not per|mit) to write largely of every particular, but shall as briefly as I may performe these two things, first give a true narrati|on, of the warre-like proceedings that hath been in New England these two years last past. Secondly, I shall discover to the Reader di|vers places in New England, that would af|ford speciall accommodations to such per|sons as will Plant upon them, I had not time to doe either of these as they deserved, but wanting time to doe it as the nature of the thing required; I shall according to my abili|tie begin with a Relation of our warre-like proceedings, and will inter-weave the speciall places fit for New Plantations, with their de|scription, as I shall find occasion in the fol|lowing discourse, but I shall according to my promise begin with a true relation of the new

England warres against the BlockIlanders, and that insolent and barbarous Nation, called the Pequeats, whom by the sword of the Lord, and a few feeble instruments, souldiers not accustomed to warre, were drove out of their Countrey, and slaine by the sword, to the number of fifteene hundred soules in the space of two moneths and lesse: so as their Countrey is fully subdued and fallen into the hands of the English: And to the end that Gods name might have the glory, and his peo|ple see his power, and magnifie his honour for his great goodnesse I have indevoured accor|ding to my weake ability, to set forth the full relation of the Warre from the first rise to the end of the victory.
The cause of our war against the Block Islan|ders, was for taking away the life of one Master Iohn Oldham, who made it his common course trade amongst the Indians he comming to Block-Island to drive trade with them, the Islanders came into his boate and having got a full view of commodities which gave them good content, consulted how they might de|stroy him and his company, to the end they might cloth their bloody flesh with his law|ful garments. The Indians having laid the plo into the boate they came to trade as they pre|tended watching their opportunities, knockt him in the head,  martyred him most Barba|rously, to the great griefe of his poore distres|sed

servants, which by the providence of God were saved. This Island lying in the rode way to the Lord Sey, and the Lord Brookes plantation, a certaine Sea man called to Iohn Gallop Master of the Small navigation standing along to the Mathethusis Bay, and seeing a boate under saile close aboard the Island, and perceiving the sailes to be unskilfully mana|ged, bred in him a jealously, whether that the Island Indians had not bloodily taken the life of our Countrie-men, and made themselves Master of their goods: suspecting this, he bore up to them and approaching neere them was confirmed that his jealousie was just, seeing Indians in the boate, and knowing her to be the vessel of Master Oldham, and not seeing him there gave fire upon them and slew some, o|thers leaped over board; besides two of the number which he preserved alive and brought to the bay. The blood of the innocent called for vengeance, God stirred up the heart of the honoured Governour Master Henrie Vane and the rest of the worthy Magistrates to send forth a 100. well appointed Souldiers under the conduct of Captaine Iohn Hendicot, and in company with him that had command, Cap|taine Iohn Vnderhill, Captaine Nathan Turner, Captaine William Ienningson, besides other in|feriour Officers. I would not have the world wonder at the great number of Commanders o so few men, but know that the Indians fight

arre differs from the Christian practise, for they most commonly divide themselves into small bodies, so that we are forced to neglect our usuall way and to subdivide our divisions to answer theirs, and not thinking it any dispa|ragement, to any Captaine to go forth against an Enemy with a squaldron of men taking the ground from the old  ancient practise when they chose Captaines of hundreds and Cap|taine of thousands, Captaines of fifties and Captaines of tens: We conceive a Captaine signifieth the chiefe in way of Command of any body committed to his charge for the time being whether of more or lesse, it makes no matter in power though in honour it doth. Comming to an anckor before the Island we espied an Indian walking by the shore in a desolate manner as though he had received intelligence of our comming. Which Indian gave just ground to some to conclude that the body of the people had diserted the Island.
But some knowing them for the generality to be a warlike nation, a people that spend most of their time in the studie of warlike policy were not perswaded that they would upon so slender termes forsake the Island, but rather suspected they might lye behind anke, much like the forme of a Baracado my selfe with others rode with a Shallop made towards the shore, having in the Boat a dozen med souldiers drawing neere to the place of

landing, the number that rose from behind the Barracado, were betweene 50. or 60. able fighting men, men as straite as arrowes, very tall, and of active bodyes, having their ar|rowes nockt, they drew neere to the water side, and let flie at the souldiers, as though they had meant to have made an end of us all in a moment; they shot a young Gentleman in the necke thorow a coller for stiffenesse, as if it had beene an oaken boord, and entered his flesh a good depth; my selfe received an arrow through my coate sleeve, a second a|gainst my Helmet on the forehead, so as if God in his providence had not moved the heart of my wife to perswade mee to carrie it along with me which I was un|willing to doe, I had beene slaine. Give me leave to observe two things from hence first when the houre of Death is not yet come, you see God useth weake meanes to keepe his purpose unviolated. Secondly, let no man despise advise and Counsell of his wife though shee be a woman; it were strange to nature to thinke a man should be bound to fulfill the humour of a woman, what armes hee should carry, but you see God will have it so, that a woman should overcome a man: what with Dalilahs flattery, and with her mournull teares they must and will have their desire, when the hand of God goes a long in the matter; and this is to accomplish his

owne will, therefore let the clamour bee quencht I daily heare in my eares, that New England men usurpe over their Wives, and keepe them in servile subjection: the Coun|trey is wronged in this matter, as in many things else: let this president satisfie the doubtfull, for that comes from the example of a rude souldier: if they bee so curteous to their wives, as to take their advice in warlike matters, how much more kind is the tender affectionate husband to honour his wife as the weaker vessell? Yet mistake not, I say not that they are bound to call their wives in Councell, though they are bound to take their private advice (so farre as they see it make for their advantage and their good) in|stance Abraham. But to the matter, the Ar|rowes flying thicke about us, wee made hast to the shore, but the suffe of the Sea being great, hindered us, so as wee could scarce dis|charge a Musket, but were forced to make hast to land drawing neere the shore through the strength of wind, and the hollownesse of the Sea, wee durst not adventure to runne ashore, but were forced to wade up to the middle, but once having got up of our legges, wee gave ie upon them, they finding our bullets to out reach their arrowes, they fled before us; in the meane while Colonell Hindecot made to the shore, and some of this number also rpul|sed him at his landing, but hurt none wee

thought they would stand it out with us, but they perceiving wee were in earnest, fled; and left their Wigwams or houses, and provision to the use of our souldiers: having set forth our Sentinels, and laid out our Pardues, wee betooke our selves to the guard, expecting hourely they would fall upon us; but they observed the old rule, 'tis good sleeping in a whole skin, and left us free from an alarum.
The next day wee set upon our march, the Indians being retired into Swamps, so as wee could not find them, wee burnt and spoyled both houses and corne in great abundance: but they kept themselves in obscuritie: Captaine Turner stepping aside to a Swampe, met with some few Indians, and charged upon them, changing some few bullets for Arrowes, him|selfe received a shot upon the breast of his Corslet, as if it had beene pushed with a pike, and if hee had not had it on, hee had lost his life.
A prettie passage worthy observation, wee had an Indian with us that was an interpreter, being in English cloathes, and a Gunne in his hand, was spied by the Ilanders, which called out to him, what are you an Indian or an English-man: come hither, saith he, and I will tell you; hee pulls up his cocke and let fly at one of them, and without question was the death of him: Having spent that day in bur|ning and spoyling the Iland, wee tooke up the

quarter for that night, about midnight my selfe went out with ten men about two miles from our quarter, and discovered the most eminent Plantation, they had in the Iland where was much corne, many Wigwams, and great heapes of mats; but fearing lest wee should make an alarum by setting fire on them; wee left them as wee found them, and peaceably departed to our quarter: and the next morning with 0. men marched up to the same Plantation, burnt their houses, cut downe their corne, destroyed some of their dogges in stead of men, which they left in their Wigwams.
Passing on toward the water side to im|barque our souldiers, wee met with severall famous Wigwams with great heapes of plea|sant corne ready shaled, but not able to bring it away, wee did throw their mattes upon it, and set fire and burnt it: many well-wrought mattes our souldiers brought from thence, and severall delightfull baskets: wee being divided into two parts, the rest of the body met with no lesse, I suppose, then our selves did. The Indians playing least in sight, wee spent our time, and could no more advantage our selves then wee had already done, and having slaine some fourteen,  mai|med others, wee imbarqued our selves, and set saile for Seasbrooke fort, where wee lay through distresse of weather foure dayes, then we departed.
The Pequeats having slaine one Captaine Norton, and Captaine Stone, with seven more of their company, order was given us to visit them, sayling along the Nahanticot shore with five vessels, the Indians spying of us came running in multitudes along the water side, crying, what cheere Englishmen, what cheere, what doe you come for? They not thinking we intended warre went on cheerefully untill they come to Pequeat riuer. We thinking it the best way did forbeare to answer them; first, that we might the better bee able to runne through the worke. Secondly, that by de|laying of them, we might drive them in secu|ritie, to the end wee might have the more ad|vantage of them: but they seeing wee would make no answer, kept on their course, and cryed, what English man, what cheere, what cheere, are you hoggerie, will you cram us? That is, are you angry, will you kill us, and doe you come to fight. That night the Na|hanticot Indians, and the Pequeats, made fire on both sides of the River, fearing we would land in the night. They made most dolefull, and wofull cryes all the night, (so that wee could scarce rest) hollowing one to another, and giving the word from place to place, to gather their forces together, fearing the Eng|lish were come to warre against them.
The next morning they sent early aboard an Ambassadour,The Indians send to the English an Ambassador. a grave Senior, a man of good

understanding, portly, cariage grave, and ma+jesticall in his expressions; he demanded of us what the end of our comming was, to which we answered, that the Governours of the Bay sent us to demand the heads of those persons that had slaine Captaine Norton, and Captaine Stone, and the rest of their company, and that it was not the custome of the English to suffer murtherers to live, and therefore if they desi|red their owne peace and welfare, they will peaceably answer our expectation, and give us the heads of the murderers.
They being a witty and ingenious Nation, their Ambassadour laboured to excuse the matter, and answered, we know not that any of ours have slaine any English: true it is, saith he, we have slaine such a number of men, but consider the ground of it; not long before the comming of these English into the River, there was a certaine vessell that came to us in way of trade, we used them well, and traded with them, and tooke them to be such as would not wrong us in the least matter; but our Sachem or Prince comming aboord, they laid a plot how they might destroy him, which plot dis|covereth it lfe by the event, as followeth they keeping their boat aboord, and not desi|ous of our company, gave us leave to stand ollowing ahore, that they might worke their mischievous plot but as wee stood they called to us, and demanded of us a bushell of

Wampam Peke, which is their money, this they demanded for his ransome, this peale did ring terribly in our eares, to demand so much for the life of our Prince, whom we thought was in the hands of honest men, and wee had ne|ver wronged them; but we saw there was no remedy, their expectation must be granted, or else they would not send him ashore, which they promised they would doe, if wee would answer their desires wee sent them so much aboord according to demand, and they accor|ding to their promise sent him ashore, This wa no wayes true of the Engish, but a devised ex|cuse. but first slew him, this, much exasperated our spirits, and made us vow a revenge; suddenly after came these Captaines with a vessell into the River, and pretended to trade with us as the former did: wee did not discountenance them for the present, but tooke our opportu|nity and came aboord. The Sachems sonne succeeding his Father, was the man that came into the Cabin of Captaine Stone, and Cap|taine Stone having drunke more then did him good, fell backwards on the bed asleepe, the Sagamore tooke his opportunitie, and having a little hatchet under his garment, therewith knockt him in the head: some being upon the deck and others under, suspected some such thing, for the rest of the Indians that were a|boord, had order to proceed against the rest at one time, but the English spying trecherie, runne immediatly into the Cooke roome, and

with a fire-brand had thought to have blowne up the Indians by setting fire to the powder: these devils instruments spying this plot of the English, leaped over-boord as the powder was a firing, and saved themselves, but all the English were blowne up, this was the manner of their bloody action: Saith the Ambassa|dour to us, could yee blame us for revenging so cruell a murder? for we distinguish not be|tweene the Dutch and English, but tooke them to be one Nation, and therefore we doe not conceive that we wronged you, for they slew our king; and thinking these Captaines to be of the same Nation and people, as those that slew him, made us set upon this course of revenge.
 the  thei .Our answer was, they were able to distin|guish betweene Dutch and English, having had sufficient experience of both Nations, and therefore seeing you have sline the king of Englands subjects, we come to demand an account of their blood, for we our selves are lyable to account for them: the answer of the Ambassadour was, we know no difference be|tweene  Dutch and the English, they are both strangers to us, we tooke them to bee all one, therefore we crave pardon, wee have not wilfully wronged the English. This excuse will not serve our turnes, fo wee haue suffici|nt stimnie that you know the English from e Dutch we must have the heads of those

persons that have slaine ous, or else wee will fight with you: He answered; understanding the ground of your comming, I will intreat you to give me libertie to goe ashore, and I shall informe the body of the people what your intent and resolution is and if you will stay aboord, I will bring you a sudden answer.
We did grant him liberty to get ashore, and our selves followed suddenly after before the Warre was proclaimed: hee seeing us land our forces, came with a message to intreat us to come no neerer, but stand in a valley, which had betweene us and them an ascent, that took our sight from them; but they might see us to hurt us, to our prejudice: thus from the first beginning to the end of the action, they carried themselves very subtilly; but wee not willing to bee at their direction marched up to the ascent, having set our men in battally; he came and told us he had inquired for the Sachem, that we might come to a parlie: but neither of both of the Princes were at home, they were gone to Long Iland.
Our reply was, we must not be put off thus, we know the Sachem is in the Plantation, and therefore bring him to us, that we may speake with him, or else we will beat up the Drumme, and march through the Countrey, and spoyle your corne: His answer, if you will but stay a little while I will eppe to the Plantation and  for them wee gave them leave to 

their owne course; and used as much patience as ever men might, considering the grosse a|buse they offered us, holding us above an houre in vaine hopes: they sent an Indian to tell us that Mommenoteck was found, and would appeare before us suddenly, this brought us to a new stand the space of an houre more. There came a third Indian per|swading us to have a little further patience, and he would not tarry, for he had assembled the body of the Pequeats together, to know who the parties were that had slaine these English men but seeing that they did in this interim convey away their wives and chil|dren, and bury their chiefest goods, and per|ceived at length they would flye from us, but we were patient, and bore with them, in expe|ctation to have the greater blow upon them The last messenger brought us this intelli|gence from the Sah, that if wee would but lay downe our armes, and approch about thir|tie paces from them, and meet the heathen , he would cause his men to doe the like and then we shall come to a parlie.
But wee seeing their drift was to get ou Armes, we rather chose to beat up the Drum and bid them battell, marching into a cham|pion field we displayed our colours, but none would come neere us, but standing remotely off did laugh a us for our patience, wee sud|denly let  or mach, and gave fie t 

many as we could come neere, firing their Wigwams, spoyling their corne, and many other necessaries that they had buried in the ground we raked up, which the souldiers had for bootie. Thus we spent the day burning and spoyling the Countrey, towards night imbarqued our selves the next morning, lan|ding on the Nahanticot shore, where we were served in like nature, no Indians would come neere us, but runne from us, as the Deere from the dogges; but having burnt and spoyled what we could light on, wee imbarqued our men, and set sayle for the Bay, having ended this exploit came off, having one man wounded in the legge; but certaine numbers of theirs slaine, and many wounded; this was the sub|stance of the first yeares service: now follow|eth the service performed in the second yeare.
This insolent Nation, seeing wee had used much Lenitie towards them, and themselves not able to make good use of our patience, set upon a course of greater insolencie then be|fore, and slew all they found in their way: they came neere Seabrooke fort, and made ma|ny proud challenges, and dared them out to fight.
The Lieutenant went out with tenne armed men, and starting three Indians they changed some few shotte for arrowes; pursuing them an hundred more started out of the ambush|ments,

and almost surrounded him and his company, and some they slew, others they maimed, and forced them to retreat to their Fort, so that it was a speciall providence of God that they were not all slaine: some of their armes they got from them, others put on the English clothes, and came to the Fort jee|ring of them, and calling, come and fetch your English mens clothes againe; come out and fight if you dare you dare not fight, you are all one like women, we have one amongst us that if he could kill but one of you more, he would be equall with God, and as the Eng|lish mans God is, so would hee be; this blas|phemous speech troubled the hearts of the souldiers, but they knew not how to remedy it in respect of their weaknesse.
The Conetticot Plantation understanding the insolencie of the enemie to bee so great, sent downe a certaine number of souldiers un|der the conduct of Captaine Iohn Mason for to strengthen the Fort. The enemy lying hovering about the Fort, continually tooke notice of the supplies that were come, and for|bore drawing neere it as before: and Letters were immediatly sent to the Bay, to that Right worshipfull Gentleman, Master Henry Vane, for a speedy supply to strengthen the Fort. For assuredly without supply suddenly came n reason all would be lost, and fall into the hands of the enemy; This was the trouble

and perplexity that lay upon the spirits of the poore garrisons. Upon serious considerati|on the Governour and Councell sent forth my selfe with 20. armed souldiers to supply the necessitie of those distressed persons, and to take the government of that place for the space of three moneths: reliefe being come, Captaine Iohn Mason with the rest of his company returned to the Plantation againe: we sometimes fell out with a matter of twen|tie souldiers to see whether we could discover the enemy or no; they seeing us (lying in am|bush) gave us leave to passe by them, consi|dering we were too hot for them to meddle with us; our men being compleatly armed, with Corslets, Muskets, bandileeres, rests, and swords (as they themselves related afterward) did much daunt them; thus we spent a matter of six weekes before we could have any thing to doe with them, perswading our selves that all things had beene well. But they seeing there was no advantage more to be had against the Fort, they enterprized a new action, and fell upon Water towne, now called Wethersfield with two hundred Indians; before they came to attempt the place, they put into a certaine River, an obscure small river running into the maine, where they incamped, and refreshed themselves, and fitted themselves for their ser|vice, and by breake of day attempted their en|terprise, and slew nine men, women and chil|dren,

having finished their action, they sud|denly returned againe, bringing with them two maids captives, having put poles in their Conoos, as we put Masts in our boats, and up|on them hung our English mens and womens shirts and smocks, in stead of sayles, and in way of bravado came along in sight of us as we stood upon Seybrooke Fort, and seeing them passe along in such a triumphant manner, wee much fearing they had enterprised some des|perate action upon the English, wee gave fire with a peece of Ordnance, and shotte among their Conooes. And though they were a mile from us, yet the bullet grazed not above twentie yards over the Conooe, where the poore maids were; it was a speciall providence of God it did not hit them, for then should we have beene deprived of the sweet observa|tion of Gods providence in their deliverance: we were not able to make out after them, being destitute of meanes, Boats, and the like: be|fore wee proceed any further to a full rela|tion of the insolent proceeding of this barba|rous Nation, give me leave to touch upon the severall accommodations that belong to this Seybrooke Fort.
This Fort lyes upon a River called Conetti|cot at the mouth of it, a place of a very good soyle, good meadow, divers sorts of good wood, timber, varietie of fish of severall kindes, fowle in abundance, Geese, Duckes,

Brankes, Teales, Deere, Roe buck, Squirrels, which are as good as our English Rabets; pit|tie it is so famous a place should bee so little regarded, it lyes to the Northwest of that fa|mous place, called Queenapiok, which rather exceed the former in goodnesse, it hath a faire River fit for harbouring of ships, and abounds with rich and goodly medowes, this lyes thir|tie miles from the upper Plantations, which are planted on the River Connetticot: twelve miles above this Plantation is scituated a place called Aguawam, no way inferiour to the forenamed places; this Countrey, and those parts doe generally yeeld a fertile soyle, and good meadow all the Rivers along: the river Conetticot is Navigable for Pinaces 60. miles it hath a strong fresh streame that descends out of the hills, the tyde flowes not above halfe way up the River: the strength of the freshite that comes downe the River is so strong, that it stoppeth the force of the tyde.
The truth is, I want time to set forth the excellencie of the whole Countrey; but if you would know the garden of New England, then must you glance your eye upon Hodsons river, a place exceeding all yet named, the Ri|ver affords fish in abundance, as Sturgeon, Salmon, and many delicate varieties of fish that naturally lyes in the River, the onely place for Beaver that we have in those parts. Long Iland is place worth the naming, and

generally affords most of the aforesaid ac|commodations. Nahanticot, Martins Vine|yard, Pequeat, Narraganset Bay, Elizabeth I|lands, all these places are yet unhabited, and generally afford good accommodation, as a good soyle according as wee have expressed, they are little inferiour to the former places. The Narraganset Bay is a place for shipping so spacious, as it will containe ten thousand sayle of ships. Capcod, New Plimouth, Dukes bury, and all those parts, well accommodated for the receiving of people, and yet few are there planted, considering the spaciousnesse of the place; The Bay it selfe although report goes it is full, and can hardly entertaine any more, yet there are but few townes, but are able to receive more then they have already, and to accommodate them in a comfortable mea|sure.
The Northerne Plantations, and Easterne, as Puscataway would not bee neglected, they are desirable places, and lye in the heart of fi|shing. Puscataway is a River navigable for a ship of a hundred tunne some six leagues up: with Boats and Pinaces you may goe a great way further; it is the onely key of the Coun|trey for safety; with twelve peeces of Ord|nance will keepe out all the enemies in the world: the mouth of the River is narrow, lyes full upon the Southeast Sea; so as there is no ankoring without, except  hazard ship

and men it is accommodated with a good soyle, abundance of good timber, meadowes are not wanting to the place; pitty it is it hath beene so long neglected.
Augumeaticus is a place of good accom|modation, it lyes five miles from Puscataway river, where Sir Ferdinand Goge hath a house: it is a place worthy to bee inhabited, a soyle that beares good corne, all sorts of gaine, lax, hemp, the Countrey generally will afford: there was growne in Puscataway the last yeare, and in the Bay as good English graine as can grow in any part of the world. Casko hath a famous Bay accommodated with a hundred Ilands, and is fit for Plantation, and hath a River belonging to it, which doth af|ford fish in abundance, fowle also in great measure: so full of Fowle it is, that strangers may be supplyed with varietie of fowle in an houre or two after their arrivall which knew not how to be relieved before; because the place in generall is so famous, and well knowne to all the world, and chiefly to on. English Nation (the most noblest of this Common-wealth) I therefore forbeare many particulars which yet might be expressed:  in regard of many aspersions hath beene cast upon all the Countrey, that it is a hard and dif|ficult place for to subsist in; and that e soyle is barren, and beares little that is good, and that it can hardly receive more people then

those that are there, I will presume to make a second digression from the former matter, to the end I might incourage such as desire to Plant there.
There are certaine Plantations Dedum Con|cord in the Mathethusis Bay, that are newly erected that doe afford large accommodation, and will containe abundance of people; but I cease to spend time in matters of this nature, since my discourse tends to warlike story, but I crave pardon for my digression.
I told you before, that when the Pequeats heard and saw Seabrooke Fort was supplied, they forbore to visit us: But the old Serpent according to his first malice stirred them up against the Church of Christ, and in such a furious manner, as our people were so farre disturbed, and affrighted with their boldnesse that they scarce durst rest in their beds: threat|ning persons and cattell to take them, as in|deed they did: so insolent were these wicked imps growne, that like the divell their com|mander, they runne up and downe as roaring Lyons, compassing all corners of the Coun|trey for a prey, seeking whom they might de|voure: It being death to them for to rest without some wicked imployment or other, they still plotted how they might wickedly attempt some bloody enterprise upon our poore native Countrey-men.
One Master Tillie master of a Vessell, being

brought to an ankor in Conetticot River, went ashore, not suspecting the bloody-minded|nesse of those persons, who fell upon him, and a man with him, whom they wickedly and barbarously slew; and by relation brought him home, tied him to a stake, flead his skin off, put hot imbers betweene the flesh and the skinne, cut off his fingers and toes, and made hatbands of them, thus barbarous was their cruelty: would not this have mo|ved the hearts of men to hazard blood, and life, and all they had, to overcome such a wic|ked insolent Nation? but Letters comming in|to the Bay, that this attempt was made upon Wethersfield in Conetticot river, and that they had slaine nine men, women and children, and taken two maids captives, the Councell gave order to send supply. In the meane while the Conetticot Plantations sent downe 100. armed souldiers, under the conduct of Captaine Iohn Mason, and Leiutenant Seily, with other in|feriour officers, who by Commission were bound for to come to randivou at Seabrooke Fort, and there to consult with those that had command there to enterprize some stratagem upon these bloody Indians. The Conetticot company having with them threescore Mohig|geners, whom the Pequeats had drove out of their lawfull possessions; These Indians were earnest to joyne with the English, or at least to bee under their conduct, that they might re|venge

themselves of those bloody enemies of theirs, the English perceiving their earnest de|sire that way, gave them liberty to follow the company, but not to joyne in confederation with them, the Indians promising to be faith|full, and to doe them what service lay in their power: But having imbarqued their men, and comming downe the River, there arose great jealousie in the hearts of those that had chiefe oversight of the company, fearing that the Indians in time of greatest tryall might re|volt, and turne their backs against those they professed to be their friends, and joyne with the Pequeats: this perplexed the hearts of ma|ny very much, because they had had no expe|rience of their fidelity: but Captaine Mason having sent downe a Shallop to Seybrooke Fort, and sent the Indians over land to meet, and randivou at Seabrooke Fort, themselves came downe in a great massie Vessell, which was slow in comming, and very long detai|ned by crosse winds, the Indians comming to Seabrooke, were desirous to fall out on the Lords day, to see whether they could find any Pequeats neere the Fort; perswading them|selves that the place was not destitute of some of their enemies: but it being the Lords day, order was given to the contrary, and wished them to forbeare untill the next day, giving them liberty, they fell out early in the mor|ning, and brought home five Pequeats heads,

one prisoner, and mortally wounded the se|venth: This mightily incouraged the hearts of all, and wee tooke this as a pledge of their further fidelity: my selfe taking boat rode up to meet the rest of the forces, lying a boord the vessell with my boat, the Minister, one Ma|ster Stone, that was sent to instruct the Com|pany, was then in prayer solemnly before God, in the midst of the souldiers, and this passage worthy observation I set downe, be|cause the providence of God might be taken notice of, and his name glorified, that is so ready for to honour his owne ordinance: the hearts of all in generall being much perplex|ed, fearing the infidelity of these Indians ha|ving not heard what an exploit they had wrought: it pleased God to put into the heart of master Stone this passage in prayer, while my selfe lay under the vessell and heard it, himselfe not knowing that God had sent him a messenger to tell him his prayer was granted: O Lord God, if it be thy blessed will vouch|safe so much favour to thy poore distressed servants, as to manifest one pledge of thy love that may confirme us of the fidelity of these Indians towards us, that now pretend friend|ship and service to us, that our hearts may be incouraged the more in this worke of thine: immediately my selfe stepping up, told him that God had answered his desire, and that I had brought him this newes, that those Indi|ans

had brought in ve Pequeats heads, one prionr, and wounded one moally, which did much incourage the harts of all, and re|plenished them exceedingly, and gave them all occasion to rejoyce and bee thankfull to God: a little before wee set forth, came a cer|taine shippe from the Dutch Plantation; ca|sting an ankor under the command of our Ordnance, we desired the Master to come a|shore, the Master and Marchant willing to an|swer our expectation, came forth, and sitting with us awhile unexpectedly revealed their intent, that thy were bound for Pequeat river to trade; our selves knowing the accustome of warre, that it was not the practise in a case of this nature, to suffer others to goe and trade with them our enemies, with such com|moies as might be prejudiciall unto us, and adantagus to them, as kettles, or the like, which make them Arrow-heads; wee gave command to them not to stirre, alledging that  wre intended daily to fall upon them This being unkindly taken, it bred  betweene their severall Com|mande but God was pleased out of his  things in such a sweet moderate may  turned to his glory and his peoples good
Tese men seeing they could not have  to  upon their desine: gave us a  their hands that if we would give

them liberty to depart, they would endeavour to the utmost of their abilitie to release those two captive Maids, and this should be the chiefe scope and drift of their designe: having these promises, depending upon their faith|fulnesse, we gave them libertie: they set sayle and went to Pequeat river, and sent to shore the Master of the vessell to Sasacoose their Prince, for to crave liberty to trade, and what would they trade for, but the English Maides, which he much disliked; suddenly withdraw|ing himselfe he returned backe to the vessell, and by way of policie allured seven Indians into the Barke, some of them being their prime men: having them aboord, acquainted them with their intent, and told them without they might have the two Captives delivered safely aboord, they must keepe them as pri|soners, and pledges, and therefore must re|solve not to goe ashore, untill such time they had treated with the Sagamore: One of the Dutch called to them on the shore, and told them they must bring the two captive Maides, if they would have the seven Indians, and therefore briefely if you will bring them, tell us if not we set sayle, and will turne all your Indians over-boord in the maine Ocean, so soone as ever we come out; they taking this to be a jest, slighted what was said unto them: they weying ankor set sayle, and drew neere the mouth of the River; the Pequeats then

discerned they were in earnest, and earnestly desired them to returne and come to an an|ko, and they would answer their expectati|on: so they brought the two Maides, and de|liverd them safely aboord, and they returned to them the seven Indians, then they set sayle and came to Seabrooke Fort; bringing them to Seabrooke Fort, request was made to have them ashore; but in regard of the Dutch Go|vernours desire, who had heard that there was two English Maides taken captives of the Pequeats, and thinking his owne Vessell to bee there a trading with them, hee had managed out a Pinace purposely to give strict order and command to the former Vessell to get these Captives what charge soever they were at; nay, though they did hazard their peace with them, and to gratifie him with the first sight of them after their deliverance: so they ear|nestly intreated us that they might not bee brought ashore so as to stay there, or to bee sent home untill they had followed the Go|vernours order, which willingly was granted to them, though it were 30. leagues from us, yet were they safely returned againe, and brought home to their friends: now for the examination of the two Maids after they ar|rived at Seabrooke Fort, the eldest of them was about sixteene yeares of age, demanding of her how they had used her, she told us that they did solicite her to uncleannesse, but her

heart being much broken and afflicted under that bondage she was cast in,The exami|nation of the captive Maides after their returne, though the younger was very young and said little. had brought to her consideration these thoughts, how shall I commit this great evill and sinne against my God? Their hearts were much taken up with the consideration of Gods just displeasure to them, that had lived under so prudent meanes of grace as they did, and had beene so ungrate|full toward God, and slighted that meanes, so that Gods hand was justly upon them for their remisnesse in all their wayes; Thus was their hearts taken up with these thoughts, the Indians carried them from place to place, and shewed them their Forts, and curious Wig|wams, and houses, and incouraged them to be merry, but the poore soules, as Israel, could not frame themselves to any delight or mirth under so strange a King, they hanging their Harpes upon the Willow trees, gave their mindes to sorrow, hope was their chiefest food, and teares their constant drinke: behind the rocks, and under the trees, the eldest spent her breath in supplication to her God, and though the eldest was but young, yet must I confesse the sweet affection to God for his great kindnesse, and fatherly love she daily re|ceived from the Lord, which sweetned all her sorrowes, and gave her constant hope, that God would not, nor could not forget her poore distressed soule and body, because, saith she, his loving kindnesse appeareth to mee in

an unspeakable manner; and though some|times, saith shee, I cryed out David-like; I shall one day perish by the hands of Saul, I shall one day dye by the hands of these barba|rous Indians, and specially if our people should come forth to warre against them, then is there no hope of deliverance, then must I perish, then will they cut me off in malice; but suddenly the poore soule was ready to quar|rell with it selfe; why should I distrust God? doe not I daily see the love of God unspeaka|bly to my poore distressed soule? and he hath said he will never leave mee, nor forsake mee, therefore I will not feare what man can doe unto me, knowing God to be above man, and man can doe nothing without Gods permis|sion. These were the words that fell from her mouth whe~ she was examined in Seabrook fort I having command of Seabrooke Fort she spake these things upon examination in my hearing.
Christian reader, give mee leave to appeale to the hearts of all true affectioned Christi|ans whether this bee not the usuall course of Gods dealing to his poore captivated chil|dren, the prisoners of hope, to distill a great measure of sweet comfort and consolation in|to their soules in the time of trouble, so that the soule is more affected with the sense of Gods fatherly love, then with the griefe of its captivity sure I am, that sanctified afflicti|ons, crosses, or any outward troubles appeare

so profitable, that Gods deare Saints are for|ced to cry out, Thy loving kindnesse is better then life, then all the lively pleasures and pro|fits of the world: better a prison sometimes and a Christ, then liberty without him: better in a fierie furnace with the presence of Christ, then in a Kingly palace without him: better in the Lyons denne, in the midst of all the roa|ring lyons and with Christ, then in a doune bed with wife and children without Christ. The speech of David is memorable, that sweet affectionate Prince and souldier, how sweet is thy word to my taste; yea, sweeter then the honey, and the honey combe; hee spake it by experience, he had the sweet relish of Gods comforting presence, and the daily commu|nion he had with the Lord, in the midst of all his distresses, tryals, and temptations that fell upon him. And so the Lord deales to this day; the greater the captivities bee of his ser|vants, the contentions amongst his Churches, the cleerer Gods presence is amongst his to pick and cull them out of the fire, and to ma|nifest himselfe to their soules; and beare them up as Peter above the water that they sinke not.
But now my deare and respected friends and fellow souldiers in the Lord, are not you apt to say, if this be the fruit of afflictions I would I had some of those, that I might in|joy these sweet breathings of Christ in my

soule, as those that are in afflictions; but be|ware of those thoughts, or else experience will teach all to recall, or to unwith those thoughts, for it is against the course of Scripture to wish for evill, that good might come of it, wee cannot expect the presence of Christ in that which is contrary to him, (a man laying himselfe open to trouble) but wee are rather to follow Christs example, Father not my will, but thy will bee done, in earth as it is in heaven; and when thou art brought thus, prostrate before the Lord like an obedient child, ready to suffer what hee will impose on thee; then if hee thinke good to trie us, wee may exclude no tryall, no captivitie though burdensome or tedious to nature, for they will appeare sweet and san|ctified in the issue, if they bee of the Lords laying on: specially when the Lord is pleased to impose trouble on his in way of tryall (as hee said to Israel of old; I did it to prove you, and to see what was in your hearts) whether a soule would not doe as the foolish young man in the Gospel, cling more closer to his honour, or profit, or ease, or peace, or liberty, then to the Lord Iesus Christ: and therefore the Lord is pleased to exercise his people with trouble and afflictions, that hee might appeare to them in mercy, and reveale more cleerely his free grace unto their soules. Therefore consider deare brethren, and erre

not, neither to the right hand, nor to the left and bee not as Ephraim, like an untamed hei|fer that would not stoope unto the yoke: but stoope to Gods afflictions if hee please to im|pose them, and feare them not when they are from God. And know that Christ cannot be had without a crosse; they are inseparable you cannot have Christ in his Ordinances, but you must have his crosse. Did ever any Christian reade, that in the purest Churches that ever were, that Christians were freed from the Crosse? was not the Crosse carried after Christ? and Andrew must follow Christ, but not without a Crosse; he must take it and beare it, and that upon his shoulders, implying, it was not a light crosse, but weighty: Oh let not Chri|stians shew themselves to bee so forgetfull, as I feare many are, of the old way of Christ: case is come into the world, and men would have Christ and ease, but it will not be in this world; is the servant better then the master? no, he is not, neither shall he be. But you may demand what is meant by this crosse, wee meet with many crosses in the world, losses at home and abroad, in Church and Common wealth: what crosse doth Christ meane? was it a crosse to bee destitute of a house to put his head in? or was it his crosse, that hee was not so deliciously sed as other men? or to bee so meane, waning honour as others had? o was it that his habit was not answerable to

the course of the world, or to bee destitute of silver and gold, as it is the lot of many of Gods saints to this day: this was not the crosse of Christ, you shall not heare him complaine of his estate, that it is too meane, or his lodging too bad, or his garments too plaine; these were not the troubles of Christ, these are companions to the crosse. But the chiefe crosse that Christ had, was that the word of his Father could not take place in the hearts of those to whom it was sent, and suf|fering for the truth of his Father, that was Christs crosse; and that is the crosse too, that Christians must expect, and that in the purest Churches: And therefore why doe you stand and admire at New England, that there should bee contentions there, and differences there, and that for the truth of Christ? Doe you not remember that the crosse followed the Church? hath it not beene already said that Christs crosse followed him, and Andrew must carry it: and that Paul and Barnabas will contend together for the truths sake? And doth not the Apostle say, contend for the truth (though not in a violent way?) doth not Christ say, I came not to bring peace but a sword? and why should men won|der at us, seeing that troubles and con|tentions have followed the purest Churches since the beginning of the world to this day? wherefore should wee not looke backe to the

Scriptures, and deny our owne reason, and let that bee our guide and Platforme, and then shall wee not so much admire, when wee know it is the portion of Gods Church to have trou|bles and contentions? and when we know al|so it is God that brings them, and that for good to his Church; hath not God ever brought light out of darknesse, good out of evill? did not the breath of Gods Spirit sweetly breathe in the soules of these poore Captives which we now related? and doe we not ever find the greater the afflictions and troubles of Gods people bee, the more emi|nent is his grace in the soules of his servants? You that intend to goe to New England, feare not a little trouble.
More men would goe to Sea, if they were sure to meet with no stormes: but hee is the most couragious souldier, that sees the battell pitcht, the Drummes beate an alarum, and Trumpets sound a charge, and yet is not afraid to joyne in the battell: shew not your selves cowards, but proceed on in your in|tentions, and abuse not the lenitie of our no|ble Prince, and the sweet libertie hee hath from time to time given to passe and repasse according to our desired wills: wherefore doe yee stoppe, are you afraid? May not the Lord doe this to prove your hearts, to see whether you durst follow him in afflictions or not? what is become of Faith? I will not

feare that man can doe unto me, saith David, no nor what troubles can doe, but will trust in the Lord, who is my God.
Let the ends and aimes of a man bee good, and hee may proceed with courage: the bush may bee in the fire, but so long as God ap|peares to Moses out of the bush there is no great danger, more good then hurt will come out of it Christ knowes how to honour him|selfe, and to doe his people good, though it bee by contrary meanes, which reason will not fathome. Looke but to faith, and that will make us see plainly, that though afflicti|ons for the present are grievous, as doubt|lesse it was with these two captive Maides, yet sweet and comfortable is the issue with all Gods saints, as it was with them. But to goe on.
Having imbarqued our souldiers, wee weighed ankor at Seabrooke Fort, and set sayle for the Narraganset Bay, deluding the Pequeats thereby, for they expected us to fall into Pe|queat River; but crossing their expectation, bred in them a securitie: wee landed our men in the Narraganset Bay, and marched over land above two dayes journey before wee came to Pequeat; quartering the last nights march within two miles of the place, wee set forth about one of the clocke in the morning, having sufficient intelligence that they knew nothing of our comming. Drawing neere to

the Fort yeelded up our selves to God, and intreated his assistance in so waightie an enterprize. We set on our march to surround the  Fort, Captaine Iohn Mason, approching to the West end, where it had an entrance to passe into it, my selfe marching to the South side, surrounding the Fort, placing the Indians, for wee had about three hundred of them without, side of our souldiers in a ring battalia, giving a vol|ley of shotte upon the Fort, so remarkable it appea|red to us, as wee could not but admire at the provi|dence of God in it, that souldiers so unexpert in the use of their armes, should give so compleat a volley, as though the finger of God had touched both match and flint: which volley being given at breake of day, and themselves fast asleepe for the most part, bred in them such a terrour, that they brake forth into a most dolefull cry, so as if God had not fitted the hearts of men for the service, it would have bred in them a commiseration towards them: but every man being bereaved of pitty fell upon the worke without compassion, considering the bloud they had shed of our native Countrey-men, and how barbarously they had dealt with them, and slaine first and last a|bout thirty persons. Having given fire, wee approa|ched neere to the entrance which they had stopped full, with armes of trees, or brakes: my selfe appro|ching to the entrance found the worke too heavie fo mee, to draw out all those which were strongly for|ced in. We gave order to one Master Hedge, and some other souldiers to pull out those brakes, having this done, and laid them betweene me and the entrance, and without order themselves, proceeded first on the South end of the Fort: but remarkable it was to ma|ny

or us; men that runne before they are sent, most commonly have an ill reward. Worthy Reader, let mee intreate you to have a more charitable opinion of me (though unworthy to be better thought of) then is reported in the other Booke: you may re|member there is a passage unjustly laid upon mee, that when wee should come to the entrance, I should put forth this question: shall wee enter? others should answer againe; What came we hither for else? It is well knowne to many, it was never my practise in time of my command, when we are in garrison, much to consult with a private souldier, or to aske his advise in point of Warre, much lesse in a matter of so great  moment as that was, which experience had often caught mee, was not a time to put forth such a que|stion, and therefore pardon him that hath given the wrong information, having our swords in our right hand, our Carbins or Muskets in our left hand, we approched the Fort Master Hedge being shot tho|row both armes, and more wounded; though it bee not commendable for a man to make mention at any thing that might tend to his owne honour; yet because I would have the providence of God ob|served, and his Name magnified, as well for my selfe as others, I dare not omit, but let the world know, that deliverance was given to us that command, as well as to private souldiers. Captaine Mason and my  entring into the Wigwams, hee was shot, and received many Arrowes against his head-peece, God preserved him from any wounds; my selfe received a shotte in the lef hippe, through a sufficient Buffe  that if I had not beene supplyed with such a  the Arrow would have pierced through me;

another I received betweene necke and shoulders, hanging in the linnen of my Head-peece, others of our souldiers were shot some through the shoulders, some in the face, some in the head, some in the legs: Captaine Mason and my selfe losing each of us a man, and had neere twentie wounded: most coura|giously these Pequeats behaved themselves: but see|ing the Fort was to hotte for us, wee devised a way how wee might save our selves and prejudice them, Captaine Mason entring into a Wigwam, brought out a fire-brand, after hee had wounded many in the house, then hee set fire on the West-side where he en|tred, my selfe set fire on the South end with a traine of Powder, the fires of both meeting in the center of the Fort blazed most terribly, and burnt all in the space of halfe an houre; many couragious fellowes were unwilling to come out, and fought most despe|rately through the Palisadoes, so as they were scor|ched and burnt with the very flame, and were depri|ved of their armes, in regard the fire burnt their very bowstrings, and so perished valiantly: mercy they did deserve for their valour, could we have had op|portunitie to have bestowed it; many were burnt in the Fort, both men, women, and children, others for|ced out, and came in troopes to the Indians, twentie, and thirtie at a time, which our souldiers received and entertained with the point of the sword; downe fell men, women, and children, those that scaped us, fell into the hands of the Indians, that were in the reere of us; it is reported by themselves, that there were about foure hundred soules in this Fort, and not above five of them escaped out of our hands. Great and dolefull was the bloudy sight to the view

of young souldiers that never had beene in Warre, to see so many soules lie gasping on the ground so thicke in some places, that you could hardly passe along. It may bee demanded, Why should you be so furious (as some have said) should not Chri|stians have more mercy and compassion? But I would referre you to Davids warre, when a people is growne to such a height of bloud, and sinne against God and man, and all confederates in the action, there hee hath no respect to persons, but harrowes them, and sawes them, and puts them to the sword, and the most terriblest death that may bee: some|times the Scripture declareth women and children must perish with their parents; some-time the case alters: but we will not dispute it now. We had suffici|ent light from the word of God for our proceedings.
Having ended this service, wee drew our forces together to battallia, being ordered, the Pequeats came upon us with their prime men, and let flye at us, my selfe fell on scarce with twelve or fourteene men to encounter with them; but they finding our bullets to outreach their arrowes, forced themselves often to retreate: when we saw wee could have no advantage against them in the open field, wee reque|sted our Indians for to entertaine fight with them, our end was that we might see the nature of the In|dian warre: which they granted us and fell out; the Pequeats, Narragansets, and Mohigeners changing a few arrowes together after such a manner, as I dare boldly affirme, they might fight seven yeares and not ill seven men: they came not neere one ano|ther but shot remote, and not point blanke, as wee often doe with our bullets, but at rovers, and

then they gaze up in the skie to see where the Arrow falls, and not untill it is fallen doe they shoot againe, this fight is more for pastime, then to conquer and subdue enemies. But spending a little time this way, wee were forced to cast our eyes upon our poore maimed souldiers, many of them lying upon the ground, wanting food and such nourishable things as might refresh them in this faint estate: but we were not supplyed with any such things whereby wee might relieve them, but only were constrained to looke up to God, and to intreate him for mercy to|wards them: most were thirsty but could find no wa|ter; the provision wee had for food was very little; many distractions seized upon us at the present, a Chirurgion wee wanted, our Chirurgion not accu|stomed to warre, durst not hazard himselfe where we ventured our lives, but like a fresh-water souldier kept aboord, and by this meanes our poore maimed souldiers were brought to a great straite and faint|nesse, some of them swounding away for want of speedy helpe, but yet God was pleased to preserve the lives of them, though not without great miserie, and paine to themselves for the present. Distractions multiplying, strength and courage began to file with many. Our Indians that had stood close to us hi+therto, were fallen into consultation, and were re|solved for to leave us in a land wee knew not which way to get out: suddenly after their resolution, fiftie of the Narraganset Indians fell off from the rest re|turning home. The Pequeats spying them pursued af|ter them: then came the Narragets to Captaine Mason, and my selfe, crying, oh helpe us now, or out men will bee all slaine we answered, how dare you

crave ade of us, when you are leaving of us in this distressed condition, not knowing which way to march out of the Countrey: but yet you shall see it is not the nature of English men to deale like Hea|thens, to requite evill for evill, but wee will succour you my selfe falling on with thirtie men, in the space of an houre rescued their men, and in our re|create to the body, slew and wounded above a hun|dred Peqeats, all fighting men that charged us both in reere and flankes. Having overtaken the body, we were resolved to match to a certaine nee or land that lay by the Sea-side, where wee intended to quar|e that night, because we knew not how to get our maimed men to Pequeat River. As yet we saw not our Pinaces sayle along, but eared the Lord had crost them, which also the master of the Barque much fea|red. Wee gave them order to set sayle on the Nar|raganset Bay, about midnight, as wee were to fall upon the Fort in the morning, so that they might meet us in Pequeat River in the after-noone; but the wind being crosse bred in them a great perplexitie what would become of us, knowing that wee were  orderly provided, both with munition and pro| but they being in a distracted condition lifted  hearts to God for helpe: about twelve of  ocket he wind turned about and became faire, it brought them along in sight of us, and about tenne a clocke in the morning carried them into Pequeat ri|es, comming to an ankor at the place appointed, the wind turned as full against them as ever it could blow  remarkable this providence of God was I leave  Christian eye to judge; Our ndians came to us,  much rejoyced at our victories, and greatly ad|mired

the manner of English mens fight: but cried ach it, mach it; that is, it is naught, it is naught, because it is too furious, and slaies too many men. Having received their desires, they freely promised, and gave up themselves to march along with us, where ever we would goe. God having eased us from that oppression that lay upon us, thinking wee should have beene left in great misery for want of our ves|sels, we diverted our thoughts from going to that neck of land; and faced about, marching to the river where our vessels lay at ankor. One remarkable pas|sage. The Pequeats playing upon our flankes; One Sergeant Davis, a pretty couragious souldier, spying something black upon the toppe of a rock, stepped forth from the body with a Carbine of three foot long, and at a venture gave fire, supposing it to bee an Indians head, turning him over with his heeles up|ward; the Indians observed this, and greatly admi|red that a man should shoot so directly. The Pequeats were much daunted at the shot, and forbore appro|ching so neere upon us. Being come to the Pequeat river we met with Captaine Patrick, who under his command had 40. able souldiers, who was ready to begin a second attempt: but many of our men being maimed and much wearied, we forbore that night and imbarqued our selves, my selfe setting sayle for Sea|brooke Fort. Captaine Mason, and Captaine Patrick marching over land, burned and spoyled the Coun|trey betweene the Pequeat and Conetticot river, where we received them. The Pequeats having received so terrible a blow, and being much affrighted with the destruction of so many, the next day fell into consul|tation, assembling their most ablest men together pro|pounded these three things, first whether they would

set upon a sudden revenge upon the Narragansets, or attempt an enterprize upon the English, or flye; they were in great dispute one amongst another, Sasachu: their chiefe Commander was all for bloud, the rest for flight, alledging these arguments, wee are a people bereaved of courage, our hearts are sadded with the death of so many of our deare friends; wee see upon what advantage the English lye, what sudden  dead|ly blowes they strike? what advantage they have of their peeces to us which are not able to reach them with our arrows at distance? they are supplied with e|very thing necessary, they are flote and heartened in their victory; to what end shall wee stand it out with them? we are not able, therfore let us rather save some then lose all; this prevailed. Suddenly after they spoy|led all those goods they could not carry with them, broke up their tents and Wigwams, and betook them|selves to flight. Sasachus flying toward Conetticot plan|tation, quartered by the river side, there he met with a Shallop sent downe to Seabrooke Fort, which had in it 3. men, they let ly upon them, shot many arrows into them. Couragious were the English, and died in their nds, but with a great deale of valour. The forces which were prepared in the Bay were ready for to set forth my selfe being taken on but for 3. moneths, and the souldiers willing to returne to the Bay, we imbar|oued our selves,  set to sayle; in our journey we met  certaine Pinaces, in them a 100. able and wel ap|pointed souldiers under the conduct of one Captaine ouhton, and other inferiour officers; and in compa|ny with them one M. Iohn Wilson, who was sent to in|uct the Company; these falling into Pequeat river, met with many of the distressed Indians, some they , others they tooke prisoners.
FINIS.
