AN
EXCELLENT
Oration of that late fa|mously
learned Iohn Rai|nolds,
D. D. and Lecturer
of the Greek tongue
in Oxford.
Very usefull for all such as affect
the studies of Logick and Phi|losophie,
and admire pro|fane
Learning.
Translated out of Latine in|to
English by I. L.
Schoolmaster.
Thy wisdoms and thy knowledge have caused
thee to rebell.

To the well affe|cted
Christian
Reader.
_ANatomists do
write, that in
the brain of
man, there is a Rete
mirabile, an admirable
Net, that is, an heape
and conjugation of
Arteries, that for the

many windings, tur|nings,
and intricate
foldings cannot be a|natomized;
and so in|deed,
as if that of the
body were to signifie
that of the minde; in
the wit and wisdome
of man there is a Rete
mirabile, an admira|ble
net, a heape and a
co~jugatio~ of manifold
infolded Subtilties,
which for the Maean|drian
windings and
turnings, and intricate
devices cannot be

be anatomized; with
this admirable net the
pernicious perverters
of Learning do catch
the poor fish and foul
they deal withall. But
if ever this net was
discovered; and that
monstrous Sphynx of
corrupted knowledge
eploded to the
World, this our Eng|lish
Oedipus that Atlas
of Learning (asSir  one
stiles him) Reveren
Rainolds hath (as I

think) in this most ex|quisite
and pathetical
Oration sufficiently
and perspicuously ef|fected,
insomuch that
(in my opinion) that
In Techno|matrian A|es. Eulogie may very
well suit to this Ora|tion,
Huc usque turpi nubilo
pressum caput,
Inter que cunas artium
pect us rude vincti te|nemus.
Nunc illa rerum mon|stra

ridemus, Chaos
Cacumque pondus, sole
perfusi novo.
Englished thus.
Till now an ugly
cloud our heads and
hearts
Opprest, and in the
Cradles of the Arts
Were tyed fast.
But with a new Sun
beam our eyes made
ope,
Now see that Chaos,
which wee late did
grope,

And laugh at it at last.
But notable is that
testimony of a grave
and learned Divine,Hn. Ick|son in his Epistle prefixed to this O|ration.
which may very wel
excite thee (Courte|ous
Reader) to the
reading, as it did part|ly
induce mee to the
version of this Orati|on.
Vt enim Academi|cis
 nobis, qui egre|gia
ipsius sanctitatis 
pietatis certamina ad|mirati
sumus difficile

fuit judicare, an vir
melior, vel doctior ille
fuerit; ita illi qui Orati|ones
hascesri legerint,
haerebunt, (opinor) ali|quandi,
an ipsi ex ea|rum
lectione doctiores
vel meliores evaserint.
For as it was an hard
matter both for the
Vniversity and us,
who have admired
the Conflicts of his
rare holines and pie|ty
to determine, whe+ther
hee excelled in

learning or in good|nesse;
so they who
shall seriously reade
these Orations wil be
in some doubt awhile
(I thinke) whether
they are become bet|ter
men, or better
Schollars by reading
them.
Then pitty it were
surely, that the Cabi|net
of the Latine
tongue should locke
up so rich a Treasure,
or that the shel of one

Language should ex|clude
many (though
not expert in the La|tine
tongue, yet judi|cious
to apprehend)
from participating of
this delectable kernel
of sound Learning 
pious affectio~. I have
therfore according to
my poor skill turned
this one into English,
hoping that I shall be
found fidus Interpres,
in rendring the genu|ine
sense  true mea|ning

thereof, though
my stile be not equi|valent
either to the
weght of the argu|ment,
or to the Cicero|nian
sweetnesse, and
elegance of the Ori|ginall
As for the usu|all
Cavils against
Translations of pro+fitable
things, let that
most learned Andraeas
Hyperius answer for
me,* In his Book  con|cion. An exact Trans|lation
makes things
so perspicuous, that

it deserveth to bee e|steemed
instead of a
Commentary.
But howsoever I
expect not to escape
the stings of Censure
especially of the com|mon
adversaries of
the Truth (the vindi|cating
wherof is the
very Center of this
Oratio~) yet this is my
Comfort, that I have
in this point kept
within the Circle of
my calling, and im|ployed

my small Ta|lent
for the publique
good. So farewell.
Thine in the
common faith,

THE
ORATION.
_IF any here
present in
this As|sembly,
(honou|red
Auditors) seeing hee
hath not heard what I
have formerly expound|ed
in Aristotles Rhetoriques,
may perhaps mer|vaile
what moved mee,
who have taken upon me

the Lectureship of the
Greek tongue to discourse
of Aristotles Summum Bo|num,
when the same par|ty
heares the Blessednesse
spoken of by Aristotle to
be now explaned by me,
and that it ought of neces|sity
bee taught, that yee
may both know how to
perswade aright,  what
the proper end of good
things is, let him not dis|like
the reason that mo|ved
me, but let him attend
to the matter now in
handling. After hee per|ceives,
that it is the drift
of my discourse to shew
Aristotles eroneous opi|nion

concerning Su~mum
Bonum, hee will (I feare
me) in his thoughts con|demne
my drift and pur|pose,
that I, but a young
man, should so transgresse
against the fashion of the
Vniversitie, as to cry
downe Aristotles credit.
But when he shall under|stand,
that I am enjoyned,
as I am a publike Teach|er,
to deliver sound and
true opinions, not errors
in the expounding of Au|thors,
I hope hee will not
censure mee too hardly.
Will hee demand what
reasons induced me to be
of a contrary opinion to

most of Aristotles Inter|preters
now a days? Tru|ly,
if I have any judgment
at all, the vulgar and tri|viall
Expositors of Ari|stotle
do always, as much
as they can, and some|times
more then they
ought, adhere unto him in
their expositions. And e|ven
as the Romans did
highly extoll all Neroes
actions, yea his Villanies,
as sacred; in like manner
they, as it were appro|ving
al Aristotles sayings,
though never so false, doe
greatly applaud him. I be|ing
therfore very inquisi|tive
after the truth, when

I had perused such writers
as were not so much in|clined
to Aristotle, I was
upon sundry good grou~ds
induced to believe, that A|ristotle
was greatly decei|ved.
For I did not onely
rest upon the opinions of
Ludovicus Vives, and
Peter Martyr (as some
malicious persons do ob|ject)
whose authority not|withstanding,
I doe, (as I
ought) much esteeme of;
but omitting others, who
have handled this point
before Vives and Martyr,
both Talaus Fox have
of set purpose lately con|futed
this Blessednesse of

Aristotles. And those an|cient,
and excellent men
have long agoe so con+demned
it, that Gregorie
Nazinze calls it con|temptible
and base Euse+bius
unreasonable  false
Ambrose, Augustine, Ori|gen,
Lactantius, Gregorie Nyssen call it very fooli in part, and all of them do
fltly affime it to be con|trary
to truh and piete.
Whose authoritie when
it is confirmed by Christ
himselfe, who alone, wth+out
any other ought to
be imbraced  all autho+rities
in the World let no
man think it strange, that

I had rather concuire in
opinion with such and so
great Clerks, then to hold
an errour with Aristotle. I
heartily wish, that this o|pinion
were well setled in
your minds, s both rea|son
and Religion doe re|quire;
that so, I might
have lesse trouble in spea|king,
and you lesse irke|somnesse
in heating those
things, which should be
as well pleasing, as they
are wont to be distastfull
unto you. But because this
conceit is so deeply roo|ted
in you, namely, that
Aristotles opinion, which
hath been approved and

defended with the great
labour and pains of so ma|ny
learned Interpreters
cannot be shaken; I wish
you not sodainly to lay a|side
this conceit of yours,
although you see it so
strongly opposed by so
many, and so great autho|rities;
onely I crave, that
you wold not obstinately
prejudicate those things
which I shal speak against
it. I suppose, that such, as
are not obstinately bent
in defending Aristotle,
will grant, that so great
authorities have some
weight, but yet they will
deny, that Aristotles opi|nion

can be co~futed with
any Arguments drawne
from his own Principles.
I will not complain, that I
am hardly dealt withall
by them, who will have
the question decided by
those Principles, which
being falsly framed have
caused this false opinion,
which I so dislike, especi|ally
when Aristotle him|selfe
useth first of all to
shake the opinio~s of those
Philosophers he contra|dicts
in the fundamentall
points, before he confutes
them; as we may observe
in Plato's Idea. But yet I
will accept of this condi|tion,

to prove Aristotle to
be in a manifest errour by
his own Principles. But
because there are some o|ther
things, which for the
present doe more concern
us I intreat your patience,
that the handling of this
point may be deferred till
another time; for as the
husbandman, when hee
intends to til his ground,
that is overrunne with
briats and thornes, doth
first rid the ground of
them, that hee may the
more conveniently pro|ceed
in his tillage,  sow
his seed; even so, before
your mindes can be setled

in the true opinion of
Summum Bonum, some
distinctions, which, (like
thornes and briars) have
encumbred them, must be
removed; that so the see
of truth may take deeper
root, and spring up more
fruitfully.
For there is risen up in
this last age of the world,
a sort of men unknowne
to the Ancients,  hated
of the Learned, who, not
out of any desire to sit
out the truth, but to con|firme
their own perverse
opinions, would bee
thought of ignorant peo|ple,
in their rufflin dis|putes,

to defend grosse
absurdities with their no
lesse absurd, and foolish
distinctions; in very deed
they doe expose them to
the judgement of all wise
men to bee laughed at.
There was one Callico (as
Eustathius reports) none
of the wisest, when hee
went to sleepe, used to lay
a brasse pot under his
head for a pillow; an hard
olster sure, but very fit
for his doltish pate; at the
last awaking, and not ve|ry
well pleased with his
hard pillow, hee filled the
pot with straw, to make it
softer; the pot certainly

was not softer, but it was
enough for Callico, all the
while the fool perswaded
himselfe that it was softer.
After the same manner,
when we seek for case and
rest to our perplexed
mindes; certaine patry
Philosophers do put under
them this leaden Blessed|nesse
of Aristotles,  when
they cmplain it is very
hard, ty fill it with the
Chaffe f Distinctions, 
perhap they perswade
themselves, that it is sof|er,
when neverthelesse, it
is a leaden lumpish Bles|sednesse
still. Whose bloc|kisnesse
is so much the

more worthy blame, be|cause
that out of an obsti|nate
wilfulnesse of uphol|ding
Aristotle, they do so
labour to reconcile the o|pinions
of other Philoso|phers
dissenting in the
very judgement of Ari|stotle
himselfe, that even
as Proteus, sometime a
stone, by and by a stock,
anon fire, then again wa|ter.
Omnia transformant se|se
in mracula rerum.
They change the~selves
to wo~derments of things.
So these men are some|times
Stoicks, by and by
Epicureans, anon Plato|nicks,

then again Aristip|pians,
and yet wholy Pe|ripateticks,
and so it see|meth
they would be all
things and nothing. Cice|ro
laughs at L. Gellius,
who, when he came Pro|consul
into Greece, called
together all the Philoso|phers
in Athens, and ex|horted
them earnestly to
leave off all wranglings,
and to spend no more
time in contentions,
which if they would
promise to doe, he promi|sed
likewise to hold with
them in opinion. But are
not Distinguishers like un+to
this Gellius? They see

well enough, that Philo|sophers
do dissent in opi|nion?
and what then?
they, like pittifull men,
go about to reduce them
to an unity on equall con|ditions.
But, because an
unskilfull person does un|dertake
the businesse, it is
the more ridiculous; And
must the busines be quite
done  finished, because
they make Aristotle the
Iudge? Wheras, if those
ancient Philosophers Pla|to,
Aristotle, and Tully did
but heare ater what man|ner
their own repugnant
opinions, are accorded
now adayes, it is to bee

doubted whether they
would laugh or chafe at
it. But if you please let us
produce some one of these
Distinguishers, which can
defend the matter to their
faces. Whom will yee
have then, Buridanus, or
Bricottus? I know ye can|not
understand them, if
they spake. Whom ther|fore
wil ye have? whom?
Donatus Acciiolus the
Florentine, both more e|loquent,
then the rest,
and better acquainted
with you; who, if hee
should appeare in place,
and behold these Philoso|phers
standing here with

Cicero, he would perhaps
thus accoast them. Why
are yee thus in an uprore,
and perplexity, O yee
Philosophers? why are ye
thus distracted with seve|rall
opinions about Sum|mum
Bonum? What, do
yee not know, how that
all your jaring, and diffe|ring
opinions may easily
be reconciled by distin|guishing?
Have any of
you wrote any thing con|cerning
felicity or Sum|mum
Bonum, which (al|though
it be clean contra|ry
to all other opinions)
yet may not be accounted
true in his kinde? I lesse

indeed wonder, that thou
O Cicero, doest not un|derstand
the Philoso|phers,
for thou hadst no
distinctions; Be not osten|ded
with mee, I say thou
wantest distinctions. O|therwise
why doest thou
teach in thy Books de Fi|nibus,
is in thy first Book,
that Epicurus placed Su~|mum
Bonum in vluptu|ousnes,
in the third Book;
that Zeno assigned it to
moral honesty;  in thy
fifth Book, that Aristotle
placed Summum Bonum
in the comprehension 
composition of all good
things internal, and ex|ternall;

Why else didst
thou refute the first opi|nion
in the second Book,
and the second opinion
in thy fourth Book? Do|est
thou not understand
Distinctions, how, and in
what manner all these o|pinions
may bee true in
their kinde? For wheras
Epicurus resolves Volup|tuousnes
to be Summum
Bonum, hee means carnall
Felicity; Zeno Vertue; he
meanes Felicity simply;
And whereas Aristotle
ascribes Summum Bonum
to united, and compacted
good things, hee meanes
added, or associated Feli|city.

Why didst thou Ci|cero
waste so much labour
about confuting Zeno's,
and Epicurus their opini|ons,
when with one one|ly
distinction, they may
easily be accorded? But
(O Aristotle!) (whom I
admire as the Philoso|phers
God) what reason
hadst thou o to calum|niate
Plato's Idaea, and to
wrest his meaning, that e|ven
thy most favourable
Interpreters do leave thee
there? Thou wilt perhaps
acknowledge this one
fault of thine. But where
is thy sharpe judgement
become? Thinkest thou,

that thine opinion ca~not
be true, unlesse Plato be
conute? Thou  wide
all the World over For I
in my life time taught, 
thy Zuingrus after my
death wrote, that thou 
Plato were both in 
truth; for his Blessednesse
was divine, and thine hu|mane,
his was after this
life, and thine in this life.
What, it by distinguish|ing
I do so reconcile their
opinions, that differ from
thine, and thine, whic
sems to contradict it sell
that there shall appear no
dfference at al? Eusebius
teacheth, that Chrstians

do  then Besse|nesse
in the knowledge 
worship of God; If wee
should deny this, wee
should be accounted im|pious;
Therefore in thy
behalf I thus distinguish.
That is an heavenly les|sednesse,
and thine a ci|vile
Blessednesse, that is
true in Divinity, ad thine
is true in Philosophy. He|lus
the Philosopher
plaed his Summum Bo|num
in knowledge; this
felicity of man consists in
the minde onely; thy felicity,
so far forth, as it con|sists
of body and minde.
The Stoicks assigned fe|licity

to vertue, and hone|sty;
this also is an active
felicity; but thine is both
active and civill. Now
forsooth thou mayst per|ceive,
that externall good
things are sometimes the
necessary parts, somtimes
not the parts, but the
appurtenances of felicity.
Here we make a medicine
of simple felicity,  com|pacted
felicity; Priamus
is not happy with an as|sociated
happinesse; again
Priamus is happy in mi|sery
with a single happi|nesse.
One rub is yet be|hinde;
wheras in the first
Booke of thine Ethicks,
thou ascribest an happy

lie to men in action; and
again in thy tenth Booke,
thou ascribest it to men in
contemplation; We will
decide the controversie,
we love not contentions;
Wee allow those active
blessednesse, and these
contemplative blessednes.
And thus, Aristotle, thou
seest the sundry opinions
of other Philosophers, 
thine owne to be all true
in their kinde. If Dona|tus
should speake thus,
what answere doe you
thinke those Ancients
would make him? If Ho|race,
Zeno, Epicurus and
Plato were present, they

and all things else would
rejoyce over him,  give
Donatus hearty thanks in
the like Verses almost, as
he gave Damasippus. Ho|rat
lib. 2. Satyr. 3.
Dii te Donate Dea
Rectum ob judictum do|ment
tonsore;
Sed und tm ben distin|guis?
For thy right judgement
Donatus,
The sexes both divine
Give thee a Barbers bles|sing
but
Where hadst thou such
fine distinctions?

Philosophers would
much wonder, that a
foolish fellow understa~ds
not, that these distinctions
are frivolous by the very
definition of Summum
Bonum; which is termed
of all Philosophers the
upshot of all things, as
that, whereon all other
good things depend, but
Blessednesse it selfe is
no where subsisting one|ly
in GOD. Cicero
would exclaime against
the words and manners
of these doltish monsters,
and tell them, that they
had disgraced all Philoso|phy
with their basenesse.

Thus would Cicero speak.
Truly I doe not (Dona|tus)
account thee unlear|ned,
as I have often done,
nor brutish, as I have al|ways
done; but a witlesse
mad man by thy distin|ctions.
For certaine it is
(although the Dunscotists
doe repine at it) that long
ago I wrote upon the like
subject, and I doe here a|gain
recite it; that it may
very well be, that not one
of so many severall opini|ons
of Philosophers is
true; for how is it possi|ble
that so many opini|ons,
so much differing, 
disagreeing bee all true?

Fire and water may soo|ner
bee reconciled toge|ther,
than those opinions,
which thou so strivest to
compose. But  the times
we live in! O the manners
of men now adays!
O fortunatam natam me
Consule Romam!
O daughter Rome most
fortunate, when I was
Consull there!
I searched out the true
Art of reasoning, and did
apply it to the practice of
Eloquence; but yee ob|trude
upon yong Schol|lars,

I know not what,
monstrous Distinctions,
and Demonstrations in
stead of true Logicke, I
searched out Philosophy
by the light of Nature,
living creatures, plants, 
the probable conjectures
of God; yee for the most
part search after nothing
but certaine trifling con|ceits,
of motion, time, in|finite,
empty matter, and
privation; which you ap|ply
to no practice, but pul
in pieces (as it were) with
your disputations. I have
declared the severall opi|nions
of Philosophers
concerning Summum Bo|num;

I have confuted
them that were false; I ap|proved
the most proba|ble;
but you have so trans|formed
their Opinions
with your Medusaean or|ceries
of distinctions, that
if you had pleaded with
me at the bar, you might
have maintained by your
distinctions, that Clodius
was at one and the same
houre both at Rome, and
erano. But what doe I
mean? Let us set aside
Cicero and other Philoso|phers;
for what doe they
here? If they should
come into our Schooles,
they would bee so trou|bled

with distinctions,
that they would suppose
themselves to bee in Epi|curus
middle Worlds, and
not in the Schools of the
ancient Arts. Do but ob|serve
these distinctions,
they will serve the turne
very well in the Schooles
in Lent. Blessednesse, di|vine,
humane, civill, hea|venly,
simple, associated,
active, contemplative, car|nall
spirituall, in this life,
after this life, according
to man consisting of soule
and body, and according
to man subsisting of soule
onely; (of soule onely?
who is that? what? doe

yee aske? The Schollar
must believe his Master.)
So farre forth as man is
of a simple substance, and
a compound substance, in
 Philosophicall truth, and
n a Theologicall truth, 
in his kinde; fifteene di|stinctions
a very com|pleat
number of even, and
odde; marke them well:
But first of all let in his
kinde be well noted; for
when all fails, in suo gene|re,
will never faile. Varro
reports, that a man may
collect 288 severall opi|nions,
concerning Sum|mum
Bonum. It is very
strange, if they be not all

true in their kinde. Rhe|toricians
contend, whe|ther
Rhetoriques proper
end bee to perswade
soundly, or to speake ele|gantly
and neatly; what
need they trouble them|selves?
each end is good
in his kinde. Why do we
make any difference be|tween
Arts and Sciences
in their conclusions, for,
to speak finely, to pro|nounce
well, or to speak
rudely, to perswade and
not to perswade, are
all Rhetoricall ends in
their kinde. For, what is
it to be in action, or con|templation,
vertue, or vo|luptuousnesse,

the narrow
path, or the broad path,
doe they not all tend to
life in their kinde? The
Canonists are hardly cen|sured,
because they called
the Romish Bishop God, as
the Romans of yore called
the Emperour Domitian
so. If they had had any
brains, they might have
distinguished him to be a
God in his kinde: A mur|thering
God as Mars, or
God of the Romans, as
Romulus, or God of this
World, as athan is. Doe
yee not thinke, that the
Physician does comfort
his sicke Patient well e|nough,

if he tell him, that
hee is a sound man in his
kinde? Surely these fel|lowes
are sharp-witted
Logicians in their kinde,
but simply they are wran|gling
pratling Sophisters,
who like Atolycus,
Candida de nigris,  de
candentibus atra.
The black to white, and
white to black they
turn.
They make miserable
men of happy, and happy
men of miserable. I would
they had been appointed
Iudges betwixt us, and

the Councell of Trent; I
suppose they would have
affirmed each Religion to
be true in his kinde, that to
a carnall man, and ours to
a spirituall man. But lest
some jesting companion
may sya, that I am fowly
fallen out with distincti|ons,
I must therfore di|stinguish
distinctions, that
I may resolve what distin|ctions
are true, and lear|ned,
and what are false 
foolish. I embrace learned
and true distinctions,
which are used in dis|putes;
but I scorne, and
reject those distinctions
as false, and absurd, which

are propounded either
simply, or in his kinde.
But heere I would not
have the authority of Di|stinguishers
objected un|to
me. For there are some,
who, if you deny this un|happy
Blessednesse to be
true in his kinde, doe pre|sently
betake themselves
to this thed-bare Max|ime,
he Scholar must be
ve the Master. Truly
I do not conceive to what
purpose they produce
ths, unlesse perhaps they
will thus argue; therefore
these felicities are true in
their kinde. O wondrous
witty! You have hit the

naile on the head Is this
a demonstration, because
it is? Artotle himselfe
could not more strongly
demonstrate.
Si Pergama dextra,
Defendi possent na hac
defensa fuissent.
If Fates to Troy had
granted a defence,
This hand of mine had
beat the Greeks from
thence.
If demonstrations make
such thunder-claps, I have
done.

Hostis habet muos, ruit
alto  culmine Troia.
The Enemy hath wonne
the walls, and
Troy comes tumbling
down.
But certainly the Schol|ler
must believe the Ma|ster,
for so says Aristotle;
And surely, he that teach|eth
must not lie, for so
sayes Aristotle also. If you
will observe Aristotles
law in teaching, unlesse I
keep the same also in lear|ning,
I shall transgresse.
But if you teach false do|ctrines,
which I ought

not to believe; it is an ab|surd
part in you to co~pell
me to believe them. If you
would have men believe
what you teach, you must
teach those things, which
you ought to teach; if you
will not discharge your
duty in teaching, I will
not discharge mine in the
hearing; for oftentimes
the Teachers authority is
very prejudiciall to the
Scholers profit. Thus said
Cicero, I like not that Py|thagorean
ipse dixit in
mens resolutio~s. But they
that are bound must o|bey;
what must, if thy
commands be unjust? A

Scholar must bee credu|lous;
if you teach false
doctrine? Hee that hath
twice suffered shipwrack
is but a fool to trust Nep|tune.
Wherefore if they
will be ruled by mee; let
them leave these poore
shifts, and sticke fast to
their surest refuge, as men
use to doe in dangerous
cases; namely, that they,
which speak against Ari|stotle,
doe not understand
Aristotles meaning. They
think, perhaps, that Ari|stotle
was a jugler, which
casts a mist ore his
Readers eyes. Do not we
understa~d Aristotles mea+ning?

O poore shift! So
Cicero reports of Torqua|tus,
who, when Epicurus
opinions were called in
question, said, that Philo|sophers
did not under|stand
Epicurus meaning.
Certaine Pythagoreans
said, that when the Hea|vens
are turned about,
they make an admirable
harmony, but men can|not
heare it. In like man|ner
Democritus said, that
his subtile moates were
dispersed thrugh the
frame of the whole uni|verse,
but all men did not
perceive them. What
were Aristotles slaves able

to understand him, and
shall not we be able? Dio
reports, that there is a cer|tain
cave at Hieraplis in
Asia, whose vapours no
living creatures, saving
onely gelded men, are able
to endure. Is not Aristo|tles
stile like unto this
Cave, whose savor, none
but Eunnees, that is, such
as want the masculine li+berty
of judgement, and
are Aristotles slaves can a|bide?
it is even so. But
perhaps they are like to
that franticke fellow Ho+ratiaus,
who, the day
after the publique playes
were ended, would clap

his hands in the Theater,
 when his friends came
running, and demanded
the reason of his acclama|tions,
seeing that no bo|dy
acted; hee answered,
that hee saw Actours,
though they could not.
These men surely see
some strange things in A|ristotles
Theater, and doe
applaud them, which wee
cannot discern. But what
if I can shew, that they
themselves do not under|stand
him but being blin|ded
with a self-conceit of
Aristotles worth, as men
distempered with some
malady, doe with that

franticke fellow imagine,
that they see that, which
they do not. And what if
I proove unto you that
Cicero, Diogenes, Laertius,
and Alexander Aphrodi|saeus
himselfe do interpret
Aristotle, as I do? What
if I shew those notable
Champions and Lights
of the Christian Church
both the Greek and Latine
Doctors, doe not onely so
expound, but also confute
Aristotle? What refuge
have they then? I know
not what answer they wil
make to Cicero, Laertius,
and Alexander; unlesse
perhaps they will say

that credit is not to be gi|ven
to examples; at least
wise, that the places cited,
are but probable, not true.
And mee thinkes I smell
what they will say of
Christian Writers. They
wil not (except I be much
mistaken) deny, that those
things, which so worthy
men have wrote against
Aristotle are true, and yet
they will deny that Ari|stotle
cried. How then can
it be possible, that in this
very point they write tru+ly
that Aristotle erred, 
yet (say they) Aristotle
erred not? You shall
heare: there is a twofold

Truth; a Philosophicall
Truth, and a Theologicall
Truth. Aristotle was in an
error according to a The|ologicall
Truth, and in that
sense he is blame worthy;
but Aristotle erred not in
a Philosophicall Truth, for
in that sense hee could not
bee mistaken without
doubt, for hee is a miracle
of Nature. What is this I
heare? A Philosophicall
Truth? and a Theologicall
Truth? This is pulling in
pieces, not distinguishing.
Now indeed, I nothing
marvell at those men, who
use to scoffe and deride
the simple Truth, when

 can
hatch two Truths for
one; as drunken men use
to see two Lanthorns for
one; and Plautinus found
two Masters for one Mes+seinus,
and mad Pentheus
beheld two Suns for one.
They have so well profi|ted
in the Art of wrang|ling,
that they have quite
forgotten how to dispute.
For what is Truth? The
Learned in the Greeke
Tongue doe call Verum
 of the Verbe , i
esse to be, because it is the
same, which it is said to
be. Therefore as Philoso|phers
teach, that Contra|ries

cannot stand together
at one, and the same time
in the same subject; so the
same Philosophers teach,
that contradictories can|not
both be true of one
and the same thing. Is it
not then a shame for our
Logicians to disable, and
enervate the very first
Principles of Logicke?
For wheras Aristotle doth
teach, that to affirme and
deny the same thing not
onely in the generall, but
also in the particular must
needs be co~tradictorious;
these men do in very deed
deny this truth; albeit
they oppose a frivolous

distinction (like a Cloud
against the Sunne, to ob|scure
the truth. Aristotles
felicity is not true felicity,
this they grant to be true
in Divinity; again Aristo|tles
felicity is true felicity;
this they will have to be
true in Philosophy. O sil|ly
Epiphanius, who didst
reck on the errours of Phi|losophers
amongst Here|sies!
O simple Iustin Mar|tyr,
to confute Aristotles
opinions in so great a Vo+lume!
Dd not they (silly
men) know how to argue
maers in a philsophi+call
truth, when they em|brace
a divine truth? But

 thou Apostle, Paul I
am sorry for thee! why
doest thou dispute with
the Stoicks Epicureans
at Athens, of the resurre|ction
of the dead, and the
life to come? It needs no
controversie at all. For al|though
all Philosophers
doe flatly deny the resur|rection
of the body, yet
it is in a philosophicall
truth; but thou Paul dost
affirme it in a Theologicall
truth, as thou hadst lear|ned
of Christ. But why
dost thou dissent from all
Philosophers to no pur|pose?
Why doest thou
not permit the Athenians

to believe Philosophers?
Doest thou thinke they
will the more hardly be|come
Christians for that?
It is not reasonable to al|low
Eusebius the benefit
of this distinction; For he
was in an error. He knew
not this twofold truth.
Hee sayes Aristotle doth
impugne, and gainsay the
Scriptures, in that hee did
ascribe felicity to the ex|ternall
welfare of the bo|dy
in that hee said that
Gods Providence exten|ded
not to every subluna|ry
thing; in that hee said
the World was eternall,
not created, and that the

soule of man was not e|ternall
but mortall. Euse|bius
affirmes, that in all
these points Aristotles o|pinions
are flat against
the Scriptures. Thou art
mistaken Eusebius! Ari|stotle
doth not thwart the
Scriptures. Thou must
learne to distinguish be|tweene
a Philosophicall
Truth, and a Theologicall
Truth. Come hither Am|brose,
come Augustine,
come all the rest of Do|ctors,
and learne of our
Philosophers, that there is
one Truth in Divinity, 
another Truth in Philo|sophy.
They do Philoso|phers

much wrong. Plu|tarch
reports, how that
one bid a Painters boy
who had painted a Cock
l-favouredly to chase a|way
all right Cocks from
his picture. Those men
that doe alienate divine
Truth, doe the very same
thing. Yet if these men
had bin Painters, I doubt
not, but they would have
distinguished, that they
had painted well accor|ding
to the truth of the
Picture, though not ac|cording
to the truth of
the Cocks nature. But as
Tiridates King of Arme|nia
called that wicked

Wretch Nero his God;
So Aristotles Patrons, do
ascribe the name of Truth
to the vaine Opinion of
Philosophy. Which if it
be once granted, what can
be so absurd, but it may
be defended, or what so
false, but it may be pro|ved,
either with an Epicu|rean,
Platonicall, Stoicall,
or Turkish Truth; or with
a Papisticall, or Hereticall
Truth; to co~clude, which
way not? And in this
manner, as Democritus
not satisfied with the opi|nion
of one World, drea|med
of infinite Worlds;
so we not contented with

one truth, shall conceive
innumerable truths of
our owne braine. But this
will be the issue of all at
last in despight of Philo|sophers,
that as Varro
reckons up 30000 Gods
amongst the Gentiles,
when indeed there was
but one onely; even so,
when they have forged
30000 Truths, they shall
finde but one only, and
that is the simple Truth,
which they so deride.
Here before I proceed a+ny
further, lest these
things perhaps exami|ned,
which I have allea|ged
(and I very gladly

desire they may be) are
not to be found in Euse|bius,
which I have cited
out of Eusebius; yee shall
understand, that they are
not to be found in the La|tine
Eusebius. Trapezun|tius,
who was Aristotles
great friend, translated
Eusebius his Books de Eu|angelica
praeparatione
into the Latine tongue.
Fourteene of his Books,
which contain a consuta|tion
of Heathens and
Philosophers, Trapezun|tius
translated into Latin,
but as for his fifteenth
Booke, which Eusebius
wrote almost altogether

against Aristotles errours,
as concerning mans Feli|city,
the Worlds Fterni|ty,
the Providence of
God, and the Souls Mor|tality,
Trapezuntius ne+ver
medled with that.
Therefore lest any man,
being deceived with the
Table of the Booke, doe
traduce me, ye shall know
that Latine Eusebius de
Evangelica praeparatione
wants the fifteenth Book,
in which are co~tained the
things by me alleaged If
any will look for it, hee
may finde it in the Greeke
Copy. Study therfore the
Greek tongue, that ye may
be able to discern the craf|tinesse

of Interpreters,
which is too frequent in
prophane writings, but
chiefly in the Scriptures.
What Eusebius thought
fit to write for the advan|tage
of the Christia~ faith,
Trapezuntius thought
not fit to be expounded,
because it weakned Ari|stotles
credit. How much
worse then hee, are our
men in these dayes, who,
fearing lest they should
savour too much of Chri|stianity,
desire to heare
young Striplings speake
finely, and to defend by
arguments, points repug|nant
to godlines; but are
loth to hear those things,

which are consonant to
godlinesse. And yet they
love Piety, they love Re|ligion,
So, I think, as the
Ape loves her puppies, or
as Iuno loved Hercules;
They love exceedingly;
they kill with loving;
They love, as Thais loved
Phaedria.
Misera prae amore exclu|sit
hunc fors,
Shee poor soule for ve|ry
love hath shut him
out of doores.
Let us speak like Phi|losophers
(say they)

when we dispute, when
wee declayme. I had
thought yee had rather
have spoken like Christi|ans.
Are you to be saved,
redeemed and judged of
a Philosopher? were yo
initiated in the Mysteries
of Philosophers? But
what does this concerne
us say they? Wee may
speak as Philosophers, we
are not Divines yet. Di|vines?
It is a womans
priviledge to say what she
list; for without doubt
they will never bee Di|vines,
unlesse perhaps
they be Popes, as (some
say) Ioane was of yore;

and albeit they may bee
such, they may not bee
Divines for all that. But
why do they separate the
bounds of Divinity and
Philosophy, like the Bor|ders
of England and Scot|land?
I thinke this was
the Deputies doing. But
yet we may speak as Phi|losophers.
What? as Dia+goras,
when hee denied
there was a God? as Pro|tagoras,
when hee doub|ted
whether there was a
God or no? as Aristotle,
when hee takes away
Providence from God?
These are the words of
Atheists. What then? as

Plato, when hee sets up a
Purgatory? or Porphyrius,
who sayes that Angels are
to be worshipped? or as
Aristotle, when he teach|eth
Free-will? Let Pa|pists
picke out such stuffe
for themselves. What
then? shall we say with
Epicurus that the soule is
mortall? with Aristippus,
that Pleasure is Summum
Bonum? or with Plato
that a mutuall Participa|tion
of Wives is to be to|lerated?
No, wee allow
none of these? But wee
would have Declamati|ons,
not Sermons. What
is a Declamation? Is it to

deny that to be a Poeme,
which wants fabulous
matter? or shall not that
be called a Declamation,
which is not stuffed with
impiety? If such are no
better, than base Strum|pets,
which esteeme no|thing
wittily spoken, but
that which is obscene;
what kinde of Philoso|phers
are they which ac|count
nothing spoken O|rator-like,
but that which
is prophane? But wee
would heare Philosophi|call
points. If they be true
and good they dissent not
from holy things. If they
bee naught and untrue,

what are they to be estee|med?
The Persia~s thought
it a great fault in a childe,
either to lie, or speak cor|ruptly;
Do yee make our
Christian Youth worse
then the Heathen? would
you not have us speak as
Philosophers? I would
have you speak like wise|men,
not like the ignorant
and unlearned. I call them
wise men, who propound
true matters, nd them ig|norant,
who teach un|truths
For Philosophy is
the study of Wisdome;
Wisdome comprehends
the knowledge of Divine
and Human things; more|over

knowledge is of true
things;  therupon those
things onely, which are
said to be true, deserve the
name of Philosophy. For
Philosophers are not
Philosophers, when they
digresse from the truth.
But because the name of
Philosophy is commonly
ascribed to the opinions
of Philosophers, whether
true or false, and not to
true wisdome; yee ought
to remember what the
Apostle warnes you to
take heed of, Lest any mn
spoile you through Philo|sophy.
Coloss. 2. 8. For there
are some amongst us now

adayes, who maintaining
most pernicious errours
contrary both to reason
and religion, call it Philo|sophy.
Nesci furtivo: Dido me|ditatur
amres.
Cnjugum vocat hc prae

On amorous ths runs
Dido's bnded minde
To hide her fault shee
Wdlocks coak doth
finde.
She called it marriage,
but she comm tred adul|tery;
They call it Philo|sophy,

but they do defend
impiety. You must not
imitate Caracalla Caesar,
who was so in love with
the very name of Alexan|der,
that he was much of|fended,
that a base Ruffi|an
(whose name was A|lexander)
was arraigned
before him. Doest thou
accuse Alexander (said he)
hold thy peace, or else wo
be to thee. Take yee heed,
lest by loving the name
of Philosophy, yee enter|tain
Philosophers errors.
He accused Alexander,
but yet a Ruffian; I reject
Philosophy, yet that
which is erroneous. But

some (like Caracalla) will
say to mee; What doest
thou condemne Philoso|phy?
hod thy tongue of
Philosophy, or ee thou
shalt heare ill news. I care
not for bad dealing from
b men: I accout not
 to be Summm
. I doe admonish
you againe, and agane to
tke  of Philosoph.
What admonitions the
Apste, and ancient Fa|thers
have given, what
the learned of la times
have continually admo|nished
you of, both by
precepts and examples,
that doe I likewise. Thus

doth Lactantsus often
presse, and repeate, that
Philosophy is false, and
frivolous; The Philoso+phers
could speak wel like
learned men, but they
could not speake truely,
because they were not in|structed
by him who was
Puissnt in Truth. So
said Eusebius, that Philo|sophers
erred from the
truth, that Philosophy was
stuffed full of vaine con|jectures,
divers errors, and
trifling toyes. Thus Ter|tullian
said, that Heresies
were suborned and sup|ported
by the Philoso|phy
of Plato, the Stoicks,

Epicurus, Heracltus, Ze|no,
and Aristotle;  that
Heresies did spring, and
spread from Secular Lear|ning.
What shall I recite
Iustine Martyr, Saint Am|brose,
Saint Augustine,
and the rest, who doe fre|quently,
and vehemently
urge the same opinion?
What shall I say of later
Writers, as Ludovicus
Vives, Picus Mirandula,
Hieronymus Savanorol?
which three most learned
men doe tell us with one
consent, that they must be
very warily perused; who
are they? I say not Phi|losophers,
but Aristotle

and Plato the Princes of
Philosophers. Why so?
because Aristotle makes
men ungodly, and Plato
superstitious. Doe ye de|sire
examples? Pompona|tius
became a wretched
man by listning too much
to Aristotle; and Ficinus
became superstitious from
the Platonicall dreames of
Spirits. Many pestilent
errours, first entred into
the Churches of Chri|stians,
 continued there
a long fime, (yea, and at
this day doe spoile them)
from the errours of Pla|to's
and Aristotles Philo|sophy.
And is the world

bewitched still, with the
delusions of Satan, that
Christians will defend
Philosophers errours in
publike Assemblies with
idle and rotten distincti|ons?
They little thinke,
that by this abominable
custome, it is come to
passe, that the Christian
Faith hath not residence
in the hearts, but in the
Temples of Christians,
and not there sometimes.
O what a difference is be|twixt
even the Heathens,
and us Christians? Ari|stotle
forsooke his Master
Plato to uphold his owne
errors, and wee will not

forsake Aristotle, that we
may defend Gods Truth.
Virgill gathered gold out
of the dunghil of Eius;
and shall we scrape toge|ther
stinking filth out of
the Philosophers Store-house?
Isocrates calleth
speech the image of the
minde; Democritus calls
it the shadow of work|manship;
shall we imagine
that our thoughts and a|ctions
are agreeable to
Christianity, if we speake
as Heathens? Wickedly
and falsly spake those fil|thy
Poets.

Vita verecunda est; Mus
jocosa mea est;
Lasciva est nobis pagi|na,
vita proba.
Demure my life, though
merry be my Muse,
An honest life lascivi|ous
lines may use.
Cstum esse decet pium
Pctam ipsum,
Versuos nihil necesse
est.
A Poet himselfe devout
and chast must be,
That his Verse bee so,
there's no necessity.

Well said Socrates; such
as the minde is, such is
thy speech. Speech is the
badge of the minde. Is
thy speech corrupt? thy
thoughts are impure. A
prophane tongue, and a
true Christian will never
agree. What pains Chri|stians
bestow in the
Church, Philosophers
destroy in the Hall. Beate
downe the affections as
much as you can, and lop
off the sprouts, yet they
will spring again, quench
the firebrands, yet they
will kindle againe. Yee
should inure your selves
from tender age to the

best things; Children
ought to be instructed in
sound, and true opinions
even from their infancie.
There is no time, place,
or occasion allotted for
naughtinesse. There is no
doubt, but Iulian the A|postate,
(who had his e|ducation
from the Empe|rour
Constantine) heard
many Sermons in the
CHURCH, but those
private Conferences at
home with hat declay|ming
Lianus instilled
into his minde more
naughtinesse, than all the
Sermons hee heard could
expell. Nero heard many

notable precepts of his
Master Seneca; but those
flattering wordes, All
things are lawfull for a
Prince, marred all those
Precepts. Deceive not
your selves, One sparke of
fire is able to kindle more
Gunpowder, than all the
Ocean can quench. Concu|piscence
is so deeply roo|ted
in us, that as it is easi|ly
kindled like Gunpow+der,
so it more contagi|ously
rageth. Take heed
of the flame, yea, the
sparks of this fire. What
doe our Philosophers an|swer
to this? Surely they
laugh at my simplicitie,

who require Godli|nesse,
and Christiani|tie
in their Studies.
What have wee to doe
(say they) with this
over-busie godlinesse and
Holinesse? Wee leave
that to Divines, let
them preach CHRIST
devoutly, What have
wee Philosophers to doe
with Divinitie? It is
not our profession. Let
us speake like Aristotle,
like Philosophers. For
whereas the Apostle
commands the CO|LOSSIANS
to be|ware,
lest they be de|ceived
through Philoso|phy,

that (say they)
belongs not to all Chri|stians,
but onely to Di|vines.
It is written in|deed
unto the CO|LOSSIANS,
and
Geographers say, that
COLOSSUS was a
Citie, but COLOSSAE
(without doubt) was a
Divinitie Schoole; or
at least-wise because it
is written unto Christi|ans,
it is an advice, not a
precept; of which sort
there are some things in
the Gospell, which are
not prescribed to all, but
to compleate Christians;
as the Expositors of Ari|stotles
Moralls do teach.

shall we leave off the old
want of defending Ari|stotle,
whom the most
learned of the Vniversi|ties
have so long time
highly esteemed? nay, we
will rather with the Au|gustinians
maintain all A|ristotles
sayings even a|gainst
the superstitious
Stoickes, according to
a Philosophicall truth,
not according to a Di|vine
Truth, not by the
light of Faith, but of Rea|son,
so farre forth as wee
are Philosophers, not as
we are Christians. Thus
do these men in their cups
bragge, and brave it out,
though not perhaps in

these very same words,
yet in the same sense. But
I wold advise these men
to co~sider, that since they
wil live like Philosophers,
let them take heed, that
they die not Pagans. A
certain plain Country fel|low
seeing a noble man
of Germany cla in ar|mour
in the morning, like
a General of the field, and
with his Mitre like a Pre|late
in the Church at eve|ning,
asked one of his ser|vants,
why his Lord and
Master did sometimes
weare an Helmet,  som|times
a Mitre; he answe|red,
because he was both

a Prince, and Bishop
of a City. A Prince,
and a Bishop said the
Countrey man? I pray
you (Sir) tell mee, if
the Prince goe to Hell,
whither shall the BI|SHOP
goe? If I had so
much authoritie as the
Countryman, I would
aske these Philosophers,
and these Centaure Chri|stians,
both men  mon|sters,
these Hermaphro|dites
both men and wo|men,
or rather neither,
who speake impiously
as Philosophers in the
Schooles, and holily in
the Church like Christi|ans,

what thinke you will
become of the Christian,
if the Philosopher bee
thrust down to Hell? Let
no body wrest my words
otherwise, than I mean; I
know not how it may fall
out, that I may hereafter
lay the fault upon your
tongues, seeing that those
things, which I have spo|ken
true, through your
misreporting them, may
be accounted false. I have
at the last bid farewell to
obscene Poets, such as
(for th most part) are not
to be taught to children.
I have fetched this out of
Saint Augustine in his

Confessions who aver|reth
Terence expresly not
worthy to be read, and
blame such Grammarians
as expound him. If this
seemes absurd to them,
why doe they finde fault
with mee? let them finde
fault with Sint Augu|stine.
But let no man so
mistake my meaning, as
though I condemned the
reading of all Poets; as
though I should say, be|cause
children must be fed
with milke, not with
flesh, some Butcher, or o|ther
should inferre, that I
spake against eating of
flesh absolutely. Now if

it bee reported againe to
Butchers that my demand
was, what will become of
the Christian, when the
Philosopher is thrust
downe to Hell; My an|swer
is this to Butchers,
that I speake of Philoso|phers
in the same sense,
that Tertullian did; What
likenesse is there between a
Philosopher and a Chri|ian?
What hath Athens
to do with Ierusalem? an
Vniversitie with the
Church? or what have
Heretiques to doe with
Christians? He calls Phi|losophers
Heretiques. He
was never acquainted

with this absurde distin|ction
of a Pilosophicall
truth, and a divine truth;
but he calls Philosophers
Hereticks. He complains,
that Philosophy hath bin
many sundry ways distri|buted
into Heresies, by
the industry and labour
of Philosophizing Fel|lows,
which have corrup|ted
the truth in the
Church. What hath A|thens
to doe with Ierusa|lem?
an Vniversity with
the Church, or Hereticks
with Christians? And yet
shall any man marvell,
why I am of opinion, that
it is dangerous to speake

like Philosophers? Men
speaking as Philosophers
have long agoe infected
the Greeke Church, and
almost all Europe with di|vers
errours. Men speak|ing
as Philosophers have
in our dayes polluted all
Italy (would to God it
were but Italy only) with
most noysome opinions.
Those two most vild and
gracelesse men (if they
may be called men) Cor|nelius
Agrippa, and Ni|cholas
Machiavell speak
as Philosophers, of whom,
the one in his naturall,
the other in his Morall
Philosophy have disgor|ged

such Lessons.
Qualia credle est rictu russe .
beon,  Stygii mn
stratremenda lacus.
As if the Stygian Lake,
or three chopt Cerbe|rus,
Had spued their mon|strous
ugly filh on us.
Pomponatius, and Car|danus
spake as Philoso|phers,
whereof the one
wrote that cursed Trea|tse
of the Souls mortali|ty,
the other broached
many impious errours in

his subtilties. I deny not,
but they are both confu|ted,
Pomponatius sleight|ly
by Contarenus, Car|dane
soundly and tho|roughly
by Scaliger. But
how many in the meane
time have they spoiled
with their philosophicall
sentences? Poison hur|teth
moe, then the Medi|cine
helpeth; neither are
all cured, that are poyso|ned.
And is any man so
foolish to seeke to bee
wounded, that he may be
cured? What then will
some say, doe you forbid
the reading of prophane
matters, lst men be cor|rupted

therby? Shall we
not reade Aristotle, Plato,
Cicero, Deosthenes? shall
wee not attaine to the
knowledge of Historie,
Philosophy, Eloquence?
And hereupon Philoso|phers
wll ampliie, that
a thing is not to be reje|cted
for the abuse of it.
Feds are drowned with
waters; Houses are con|sumed
with fire, the earth
is scorched with the Sun,
men are spoiled by buil|dings,
and yet for all this
water, fire, the Sun, hou|ses
and buildings are ne|cessary.
I would not have
the thing it selfe, but the

abuse thereof abolished,
and the proper use therof
restored again. I doe not
say, that hee offendeth
that reades profane Au|thors,
so that he doe but
lightly passe them over;
but this I take to be sin|ull,
when profane things
are believed; for then art
thou foyled, when thou
givest credit to them.
And in that case. I hold
it dangerous to defend
them; for therby perhaps
thou hurtest others, or
else art hurt thy self. Thou
must also take heed not
onely what thou defen|dest,
but also what, and in

what manner thou rea|dest;
For although thou
doest but touch those
things, that thou readest,
yet be not so carelesse; for
many things, but touched
doe hurt, and sometimes
kil. Saint Augustine makes
mention of a little Fly
called a Cynips, which is
of so small a substance,
that, unlesse you be very
sharp-sighted, you can|not
discern her, yet when
shee fastens on you, shee
will sting soundly, so that
shee, that you could not
perceive co~ming to sting,
you shall too late repent
her stinging. But if your

judgements bee not so
sharp-sighted, to discern
those, which I call the
stings of philosophy, yet
know, that Philosophy is
 Cynips, which uses to
sting heedlesse men; feele
it not after it is too late.
The veriest foole that is
learnes wit after a shrewd
turn. The byting of an
Aspe procureth a most
sweet sleep, insomuch that
one cannot be sensible of
death approaching, but it
is a deadly sleepe at last.
Enjoy thy sweete sleepe
Cleopatra, I envie thee
not, for thine Aspes by|ting:
I will propose to

you Ieromes opinion set
downe in his Epistle to
Dmsus concerning the
Prodigal sonne; it is in|deed
rejected of the per|tinacious,
but embraced
of the wiser sort, and is
very necessr or al sorts
of men. Ieromes words
are these, Even as it was
lawfull for the Iewes, if
they had gotten a beauti|full
woman captive, to take
her to wife upon this con|dition,
that first her head
should be shaved, her nails
pared,  her captive gar|ments
cast away; In like
manner, it may be lawfull
for Christians to use Philo|sophers,

and ooks of Se|cular
Learning, but with
this condition, that what|soever
they finde in them,
that is profitable and use|full,
they convert it to
Christian doctrine, and
do, as it were, shave off,
and pare away all super|fluous
stuffe concerning I|dols,
love and carnal cares
of the world. And lest any
should cavill and say, that
those things, which wee
ought to believe, apper|tain
to faith, and yet men
are not for all that forbid|den
to talke as Heathens;
Ierome proceeds, (His
meaning is not of such as

speake profanely, but of
such s read profane mat|ters.)
Neither let us flatter
our selves (saith hee) al|though
wee do not believe
those things which are
written, when others con|sciences
are wounded; and
wee may be thought to ap|proove
those things wee
reade, when we do not re|prove
them. If any wil
further object, that these
things are written to the
Bishop, or else they are to
be understood of deeds,
and actions; let him know
that Ierome speaks also of
words; yea, of all Chri|stians
in generall. For hee

annexeth, Farre be it from
 Christians mouth to ut|ter
omnipotent love, so
helpe Hercules, so help me
Castor, and such like ra|ther
bug-beares, than di|vine
powers. Therefore
hosoever shall at any
time utter such idle
ords, hee is not to be
allowed in that. Marke
hat Ierome sayes, farre
 it from a Christians
uth to utter Omnipo|tent
Iove, so help me Her|cules,
or Castor, and such
ike rather bug-bears, than
leities. What shal we not
ame the immortal gods,
not Iupiter? What, not

in verse? not in our talke?
not when wee declayme,
or dispute? Why do yee
aske mee? Augustine re|proves
it, Ierome abhors
it. Far be it from a Chri|stian
to speak thus. And
if the most excellent men
have been so strict about
trifling words, let our wit
lesse youngsters at length
leave off their railing in e|very
place where they
come, that there are some
upstarts of a new opini|on,
who would neither
have others to defend A|ristotle
in all points, nor
yet wil defend him them|selves.
O hainous fact!

My neighbour Q. ube|r
doth advertise thee C.
Caesar of a crime never
heard of before, Q. Li|garius
is gone into Africa.
That which all the Anci|ents
both sacred and pro|phane,
Greeks, Latines,
Christians, and Heathens
have freely done, that
which the most learned
amongst later Writers of
Logicke, Rhetoricke, and
Philosophie both naturall
and morall, have not one|ly
done themselves, but
taught others to doe so,
(because men by nature,
Philosophers by truth,
discreet men by reason,

wise men by piety, and
Christians by religion are
not perswaded, but com+manded;
not intreated,
but compelled) some fa|ctious
fellowes, who ac|cuse
Aristotle of many
grosse errours (although
hee alone of all men the
the Pope excepted could
not erre) have appeached
us of a new crime never
before heard of till now.
What shall wee do ther|fore?
Whither shall wee
turn our selves? shall wee
all to reasoning? But it
cannot be possibly that
ever Aristotle should be
refued by arguments;

no, although hee should
speake Contradictories
Shall wee flie to authori|tie?
You object modern
Writers, Vives, Ramus,
Talaeus, Martyr; these are
either unlearned, or
proud. If you presse us
with ancient Fathers, as
Eusebius, Augustine, Ter|tullian,
Ierome, they doe
not condemne us, but the
Heathens. If you alleage
the Schools of Germany,
and Switzerland (who
have reformed the man|ner
of teaching Philoso|phy
with Religion,) they
will be thought of some
to have dealt superstiti|ously

in this point; al|though
I doubt not, that
learned judgements are
nothing at all mooved
with these pettie cavils,
yet to give al men satisfa|ction,
if I can) not insisting
upon these arguments,
which they are wont
to jest at) I will produce
certain witnesses, so fresh
in memory, that have ob|served
this manner of
teaching, men so well
practised in Letters, that
doubtlesse they have been
well versed in it. They are
by place, and authoritie
Bishops at least, for num|ber
almost two hundred;

namely the whole gene|rall
Councell of Lateran
held at Rome within lesse,
then these sixtie yeeres.
Marke I pray you dili|gently
what I alleage, for
it is a place most worthy
your observation, and it
is extant in the third Vo|lume
of Councels in the
Lateran Councell under
Leo the tenth, the eighth
Session; if any be desirous,
hee may see this more at
large, which I doe but
point at. About that time,
when the Professors of
Aristotle in the Vniversi|ties
had prevailed thus
farre, that they defended

by Aristotle the soule to
be mortall, at least wise in
a philosophicall sense (o|therwise
perhups, then
Aristotle himself meant)
because that Commenta|tor
Averroes thought,
that Aristotle meant so; it
was declared by the La|teran
Councell, That cer|tain
pernicious errours, al|wayes
abhorred of the
faithfull, were sowed in the
Lords field by that conta|gious
Contriver of all mis|chiefe,
and amongst the
rest, that the soule of man
is mortall; which whosoe|ver
shall affirme, to be
true, are taxed by that

Councell for rash and
nadvised Philosophers.
And no more but so?
yea, they are all con|demned,
that doe af|firme,
or once questi|on
it. True may some
say according to Divini|ty;
nay, but they are con|demned,
whosoever doe
ouch it to be true even
in Philosophy; I say
Philosophy; for it is ex|presly
named in the De|cree.
Heare the generall
Decree annexed. Foras|much
as truth can in
 wise bee opposite to
truth, wee doe resolve,
that every assertion con|trary

to the Christian faith
is altogether false; and we
doe straightly forbid all o|thers
to conclude other|wise.
And wee doe decree,
that all persons, who doe
pertinciously mayntaine
this errour, are to be taken
heed of, and punished as
breeders and dispensers
of damnable heresies, and
to be hated and abhorred
in all points, as Hereticks
and Infidels, who go about
to extinguish the Catho|like
faith. You heare, that
our rashheady Philoso|phers
are pronounced by
a generall Councell to be
hated and abhorred as

Heretickes and Infidels.
But now (lest they might
seem onely to make a decree
against the defenc
of Aristotles errors) they
enjoyn further, that they
be not onely not defen|ded,
but also, that they be
ongly opposed, and
rejected. Which, let them
ell consider, who have
he charge of Philosophi|all
disputations; for thus
 follows in the Decree.
Wee straightly charge and
command all Professors of
Philosophy in Vniversities
and publique Readers else|where,
that when they
read, or expound to their

hearers the points of Phi|losophy,
which are contrary
to the true faith, as of the
soules mortality, the worlds
eternity or such like opini|ons,
that to their uttermost
power, they vindicate the
truth of Christian Religi|on
from such errours, and
explain it to their hearers,
and (as much as they can)
both by doctrine and ex|hortation
root out, and con|fute
these arguments of
Philosophers, seeing they
may be easily confuted.
Thus ye have the Decree,
the curse is denounced a|gainst
all te violaters
therof. And this Decree

was not ratified by a few,
but by the whole Coun|cell
in generall; saving
onely worshipfull Master
Thomas Superintendent
of the Preachers Order
did not approve it. He, as
it seems, more favouring
Aristotle, then Piety, said
that the second part of
the Decree did not please
him, wherin it was enjoy|ned
that Philosophers
should openly teach, and
instruct their Auditories
in the true Faith. Now
then let it seeme doubtfull
(if it be possible) whe|ther
the conceit of one
onely Master Thomas a

younger Brother of the
Preachers Order, or the
Decree of the general L|teran
Cou~cel ratified with
an execation annexed, is
to be preferred. Moreo|ver,
if the Latera~ Cou~cel,
if the Rmish Bishop, if the
Cardinals themselves of
the Romish Church (ma|ny
chief points of whose
Religion rather agrees
with Aristotle, and the
Philosophers, than with
Christ, and his Apostles)
doe denounce a Curse a|gainst
all such, as shall af|firme
Aristotles opinion
dissenting from Christ to
be true, though in a phi|losophicall
sense, what
will become of us thinke

you, who have taken up|on
us the profession of
pure Religio~ purged from
Superstition, freed from
the rotten devices of men,
and clensed from the
drosse and dregs of all er|rours?
I omit the pressing
of this point in the Ny|cene
Assembly of Cardi|nals
appointed for that
purpose; They held it a
great abuse, and a matter
of dangerous co~sequence
for Philosophers to
broach impieties in pub|lique
Schools, and not to
discover how weake the
light of nature is to dis|course
of God, the world,
and such like arguments,

and in all their disputati|ons
not to make piety
their chiefest ayme. I
presse no the opinion of
sworne Witnesses those
Cardinals, Sadole, Conta|re,
Poole; I stick to the
Laterane Councels De|cree.
Whosoever there|fore
affirmeth it to bee
true but in a philosophi|call
sense, that the soule i
mortall, or that the world
is eternall, if he feare God,
let him know, that hee
grievously prophanes
Gods Name, when the
authority of his Word is
disabled, either in jest, or
in earnest. If hee be a Pa|pist,

let him know, that
he is pronounced an exe|crable
Heretick, and Infi|dell,
lyable to a Curse, and
delivered up to Satan, by
the Romish Bishop, and
the Lateran Councell: if
hee be an Atheist, let him
take his liberty of philo|sophizing,
defend his di|stinctions,
and what hee
list; I forbid him not. To
all others, whether they
are godly, or seeme to be
so, what I say of the
Worlds Eternity, or the
Souls Mortalitie, I say the
same of all other questi|ons,
which dissent from
Christian godlinesse (a|mongst

which is Aristo|tles
opinion of Blessednes,
condemned by the judg|ment
of Eusebius, Lactan|tius,
Augustine, Ambrose,
Gregory Nyssen, nazan|zene,
and many other
most learned men:) Let
them look to it, which defend
it. Let Philosophers
distinguish the Sorbonists
barke, Epicureans rage,
Machiavilins scoffe,
the Truth is conquerer;
They themselves totter,
and shake, fall and rot, but
the Truth will triumph
Truth (like the Palme-tree)
the more it is kept
downe, the more it flou|risheth,

and by how much
the more forcibly it is
bended down-wards, by
so much the more vigo|riously
it reflecteth up|wards.
The Sun ofttimes
is darkned, but that dark|nesse
is discussed. Proser|pines
golden branches are
broke off, but they spring
again; Truth may be pres|sed,
but it cannot be op|pressed.
But if any Novice
in Philosophy be offen|ded
at these things, which
are truly uttered (neither
can it bee expected but
some will take offence at
them) let him not like a
Momu backbite in a cor|ner,

or maliciously tra|duce
this, or that thing,
which I have spoken, but
let him refute mine Ora|tion.
He shall not need to
goe to the Augustinian
Monkes, let him writewithin
his owne walls;
Words are but winde,
writings will stick by it,
let the learned judge. I
will most willingly give
him a copy of mine Ora|tion.
And so I doe hear|tily
againe, and againe
intreat the Aristotelians,
if they have any confi|de~ce
in their cause, if they
beare any true affection
either to Aristotle, or Phi|losophy,
or the Truth,

that they will confute
mine opinions. If they
cannot doe it (for I doubt
not of their good will to
do it) let them leave their
wonted obstinacie, and
yield to the truth. Let
them not object, they are
not suffered to speak their
minds openly, they have
place enough to write
their mindes, and that
they may do more freely,
and upon better delibera|tion.
I acknowledge
mine own weaknesse, no
man more, but strong is
the Truth. I doe not so
much distrust my selfe, as
I trust to my Cause. A
very child may mayntain

a good cause; but Cicero
himsefe is not a sufficient
Patron for a bad cause
But I would wish them
to provide new distincti|ons;
for these, which I
have handled, have been
oftner boyled, than the
Colewot in the Pro|verbe,
not twice, but a
thousand times, which
the stomack of Polyphe|mus
himself is not able to
disgest, so that it is no
mervaile our Schollers
are sicke so often, when
they are crammed with
such distinctions. If any
more sober minded hath
either not understood, or

not approoved what ac|cording
to mine abilitie I
rather pointed at, than
explained, by reason of
the shortnesse of the time,
I intreat him to come to
mee; hee shall finde mee
most ready to teach what
I know, or to learn what
I know not: We do not
all know all things, I may
erre, I am willing to be
instructed. This onely I
crave, that no man doe
rashly carpe at what is
done; I neither contemne
nor condemne the studie
of Philosophy. But I see
a deeper wound concea|led.
There are some in

whose hearts impious
profanenes is so fast roo|ted,
that they make piety
not onely to seeme harsh
and unsavoury to others,
but to be rejected and vi|lified
by themselves. Tru|ly
as Saint Augustine
wrote long agoe (that the
enemies of grace lay conchedunder
the name of na|ture)
so it may be as truly
said in our times, that the
enemies of the Faith lie
couched under the name
of Philosophy. I know
indeed there are many
that erre through lack of
knowledge, but I mean
the obstinate, and perti|nacious

Patrons of Phi|losophy;
of whom would
to God that were untruly
spoken, which I here
speak againe with griefe,
The enemies of the faith
lie couched under the
name of Philosophy. I shall
be thought of some to be
their enemy, now I have
rub'd their soares: So
mad Orestes in Euripides
called his sister Electra a
Fury of Hell, because she
tied him fast in his bed,
lest hee should run mad;
But her brothers outragi|ous
words nothing daun|ted
Electra, neither shall
these mens prejudicate

censures disquiet mee,
when they are whole,
they will give me thanks.
The Physician must bear
with the frowardnesse of
his patient; For I am not
ignorant how many and
how bitter grudgings I
shall meet with all, which
did I know to bee spent
upon these trifles of
mine, I should be very
stupid, if I should not e|steeme
them as matters of
great importance, both
for your benefit, true pie|ties
sake, and Gods glory,
which (the Lord is my
witnesse) I onely aime at.
These may seeme light

matters, but the trees vi|gour
consists in the root.
The Scriptures and pro|fane
writings are like Hip|pocrates
twins, laughing
together, weeping toge|ther,
sicke together, and
sound together. In those
Vniversities where the
Gospell doth flourish, the
ooleries of Duns Scotists
are banished thence, wit|nesse
Geneva, Leiden, Ba|ill,
Germany is witnesse.
In those places, where A|ristotle
beares sway, there
all impiety rules and
raignes; Witnesse Paris,
Padua, Italy is witnesse.
But yet let all impedi|ments

to Pretie doe their
worst, wee may defend
Philosophy even to
death, we may study pro|fane
Arts, but so, as they
bee referred to pious
things. This was the
minde of that good old
man Master Richard Fox,
whose Image is every day
before our eys; This one|ly
was his chiefest care.
And howsoever hee fell
into the error of the times,
yet all his care was, that
Religion, Piety, and god|ly
Exercises should flou|rish
and increase daily a|mongst
us. Who, seeing
hee hath left behind the

expression of this his
good desire rather in the
Statutes of the house, than
in our behaviour (which
is to be lamented) there|fore
hee seemes to speake
to us all continually, as a
father to his children in
this manner.
Wheras I did heartily
desire you young men, my
sonnes by adoption, and
brethren in Christ, to be
brought up in the know|ledge
of God, which is
true blessednesse; lest the
thorny cares of the world
should choake the spring|ing
seeds of godlinesse in
you, I built an house for

you, that so you being
freed from carking cares,
might wholy apply your
studies. I provided nou|rishment
for your bodies,
and soules. I admonished
you to be mindfull, that
your place assigned you
on earth was not perma|nent,
but transitory, and
that you have here no a|biding
City, but must
look after one in Heaven.
I have ordained for you
Professors of the tongues,
and Arts, that so you at|taining
to the knowledge
of them in your younger
yeeres, might be enabled
to underrgoe weighty af|faires

hereafter. I beseeched
you in the bowels of
Iesus Christ, that you
would devote all your
studies to Gods glory. I
have declared to the
World, that this College
of mine was founded for
Divinitie sake. I have en|joyned
the other Lectu|rers
to designe all their
labours, and studies to ac|commodate
the Divine.
I have earnestly exhorted,
and enjoyned you all to
strive, and contend with
all possible diligence for
the knowledge of Divi|nitie.
I had good hope,
that this Colledge would

have sent forth many
both excellently learned
men, and sound Christi|ans,
who being well sea|soned
themselves with
heavenly wisdom, would
make the unsavory minds
of others to relish pietie,
bring the light of the
Gospell to them that sit
in darknesse, restore the
sick to health, refresh the
poore, strengthen the
weak, direct them that go
astray, and raise up the
dead by the Gospell. But
alasse my hopes are fru|strate;
my labours are all
in vaine; yea, so short of
arriving at the desired ha|ven,

that they are over|whelmed
with a tempest
in the very mid-way.
That Origen, when he
taught profane learning to
the Heathens at Alexan|dri,
had such good suc|cesse
in teaching of Rhe|torique,
by sometimes in|terlacing
Examples and
Sentences of Godlinesse,
that many of them were
converted to Christianity.
I trust, Christians are
not made impious by
your Expositions of Mo|rall
Philosophy in Ox|ford;
but I am sure you
corrupt weake Schollers
with your Epicurean li|centiousnesse

of life. Thus
the streams, which should
refresh the dry soules of
poore wretches, that the
plants of piety might
spring apace, are quite
dried up in the very foun|tain;
so the fruit is perish|ed
in the blossome, the
Corne is crushed in the
blade, before it can come
to a true ripenesse, and be
fit for food. For what o|ther
thing, did that grace|lesse
Apostate Iulian pra|ctise,
when hee laboured
to extirpate Christian Re|ligion
out of the World,
thn command, that such
opinions as opposed Chri|stian

piety should be pub|liquely
taught, and defen|ded
in Schooles, that so the
younger sort might loathe
and distaste Christianitie
quite. Impious likewise
was the practice of that
Heathenish Tyrant Ma|ximinus,
who caused such
points, as were contrarie
to syncere godlinesse, to be
expounded to the hearers,
and to be learned without
book, yee that professe the
Name of Christ, do yee
think, yee have done very
well, when yee have by
your Declamations op|posed
the blasphemous
errours of the Gentiles,

(which Basil aborreth
once to mention) and yet
you still uphold the base
opinions (as Chrysostome
calls them) of Aristotle.
O crva in terris animae,
 coelestium inanes.
You groveling Souls on
earth that take delight,
Of heavenly matter
void,  empty quite.
What madnesse hath
so infatuated your senses,
that yee suck poyson out
of the Philosophers, con|vert
helps into hinderan|ces,
emrace vanity for

verity, take the dregs,
when you may have the
finer stuffe? Do yee pro|fesse
Christ in the Church
in words, and Aristotle in
the Schools in good ear|nest,
and Epicurus your
lives and actions? What
a shame is it, that may be
verified of you, which
Ambrose said of the Ar|rians,
They have forsaken
an Apostle, and followed
Aristotle. Why doe yee
waste good houres about
trifles, divine wits about
noxious things, and con|sume
that precious time,
which should be spent in
History, Oratory, and

Philosophy (but especi|ally
in sacred matters,
wherby Truth and God|linesse
might be promo|ted)
and lie aking in the
filthy puddles of doting
silly men? Do yee thinke
I was ever so sottish, as to
forbid yee the imitation
of Lyranus, and Hugo
(patternes for Divines)
in interpreting the Scrip|tures,
or did the same I
ever propose such Scums,
as Stannihursts Logicke,
Paulus Venetus his Ana|lyticks,
Niphus his To|picks
or Donatus his E|thicks
to be once medled
withall of young Stu|dents?

Does not my Pi|cture
put yee in minde to
what end yee were cho|sen
Schollars of this
house, what yee ought to
ayme at, and to what pur|pose
ye should designe all
your endevours? Are yee
not dily stirred and inci|ted
(like so many Be) to
dispose all your hony ex|tracted
out of the flowres
of Truth to Gods glory?
Are yee not convinced in
the judgements of those
holy men EUSEBIUS,
Saint Augustine, Lactan|tius,
Iustine Martyr, and
the rest of the Fathers,
who have with so great

industry, and exquisite
knowledge plucked up
by the roots, and trodden
under foot the false opini|ons
of Philosophers, and
Aristotle? Are yee not sa|tisfied
with the authoritie
of the Latern Councell,
of so many Bishops, so
many learned men, and
choice Cardinalls, who,
(to the end, that Christi|ans
might in their tender
yeers be informed in true
opinions) have most
straightly charged, that
the weaknesse of the light
of Nature should be made
knowne, laid open, and
often pressed in Audito|ries?

What is in you or
any of you (young men)
unlearned in comparison
of so many aged men, and
so many Fathers renow|ned
both for Learning 
Pietie, that yee should
account your selves wiser
than they, either in trai|ning
up such as yee in|struct,
or sharper-witted
in understanding what ye
reade, and that those
points, which they con|demned
in Aristotle con|cerning
Nature and Man|ners,
as false and foolish,
yee should censure to be
unjustly condemned, and
approve them by your

absurde Distinctions?
Have I therefore erected
Corpus Christs Colledge
for Divines that Aristotle
might have moe follow|ers,
and my Saviour no
pious servants? Have I
therefore conerred so
large benefits upon you
that yee should in your
speeches preerre ungod|ly
and unprofitable be|fore
good and wholsome
matters, mans glory be|fore
Gods glory, the in|fernall
gods before the
most mightie God? Have
I therefore ordained that
famous man Ludovicu
Vives to be your Lectu|er,

who taught you in
his life time by admoni|tions,
and after his death
by his writings, how the
corrupted Arts might be
thoroughly purged and
clensed? And are ye now
so silly (young men) as to
leave Viands for Acorns,
Trees for Chips, and with
the Dog return to his vo|mit,
and with the Swine
to wallowing in the mire?
It was my desire, and I
enjoyned you to observe
it, that such as were sound
should not be corrupted,
but the bad should be di|rected,
the ignorant shold
be instructed, and not the

capable made fools, nor
to regard what doting
Philosophers dreamed of,
but what true things
were comprised in the
Arts. Is not the flesh of
it self raging enough, for|ward
enough to defecti|on,
prone to naughtines,
and flexible to every kind
of vice, unlesse yee o|ment,
and feed it with u|ell
etched from Philoso|phers,
to inflame the
sparks of impietie, and so
adde fire to fire? ye think
your selves not able e|nough
to heare Aristotle,
but yee are to heare
Christ. Shake off this

drowsines, trample upon
prophane things, be wise
in heavenly things, search
out the truth, reverence
godlinesse; and that not
lazily, but earnestly, with
all your industry, and
with your whole heart,
night and day, at home
and abroad, privatly, and
publikely. The violent ay
hold of the kingdome of
Heaven. Not the sloth|full,
but the runners get
the Crowne. Hee that
knows not Christ knows
nothing. True Religion is
true Blessednesse. Let no
man deceive himself; lear|ning
without godlinesse

is poyson. Whom it pos|ssesseth,
it puffs up, who~ it
puffs up it kils. The most
glorious God enlighten
your mindes with the
brightnesse of his grace;
that yee may alwaies be
mindfull of that account
yee are to give to the se|vere
Iudge not onely of
wicked works, but of idle
words; and let go the tri|fling
curiosities of worth|lesse
men, the glittering
sbtilties of Philosophers,
the apish toyes of Sophi|sters,
ooleries of Dun|sists;
but lay hold on true
and proficient Learning,
wherewith yee being ex|quisitely

furnished, and
with Piety adorned may
at length bring honour
to God, salvation to your
selves, and be helpfull to
others. These things sure|ly
that pious olde man
(most respected young
men) doth daily speake
unto us, though not in
words, yet to the same ef|fect
in his desires Which
if you carefully consider,
I beseech you all in the
presence of the Lord (be|fore
whose dreadfull Ma|jestie,
their consciences
that reject saving know|ledge
shall one day trem+ble
and quake) that yee

abuse not your own, and
others excellent wits. Ye
that teach, and yee that
are taught, be diligent, the
one in delivering, the o|ther
in receiving conveni|ent,
not impertinent; ne|cessary,
not frivolous;
profitable, not triviall
things. ime posteth a|way;
the arts are difficult;
life is short; error is dan|gerous;
trifles are hurtful,
truth is precious. Christ
is the Marke. Let them,
that know not true wise|dome,
enquire after it; and
let them that know it, ex|presse
it in their speeches;
lest others contemne wis|dome

before they know
it; and they themselves
never attaine to a true,
but a false wisdome
to no purpose.
Dixi.
