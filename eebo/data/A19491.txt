TO THE RIGHT Honorable Sir Thomas Stewart of Gairntilie, and his vertuous Ladie, Grizzell Mercer, Grace and peace from God the father, through our Lord Iesus CHRIST.
_IT is a no|table say|ing of the Apostle, If in this life onely we haue hope in Christ,1 Cor. 15.19 wee are of all

me~ the most miserable: For, whereas others be|ing ignorant of beter things to come, set their harts on these, which are present: if wee despising such comforts as now we may enioy, should also be disapointed of those, which afterwards we looke for, Our case indeede were most lamentable: but praised be God, it is farre otherwise; for where the comfot of the world|ling ends, there the grea|test comfort of the Chri|stian beginnes.Psal. 17.14 The men of this world (saies Da|uid) haue their portion

in this life:Luk 6.24. yea our Sa|uiour saith, They haue receiued their consolati|on here.Luke 16. It was spoken in that Parable by Abra|ham to Diues, Remem|ber that in thy life thou receiuedst thy pleasures: And it appertaines to all the wicked: better things then these, which prsent|ly they see, neede they ne|uer to looke for. And therfore no maruell, that as the taste of the Colo|quint, or wilde Gourd, made the children of the Prophets abhor thei meat, so the taste of death make all the pleasures 

refreshments of their life loathsome to them. Or as the hand which wrote to Beltazar on the wall his imminent iudgment, did in a moment turn all the solace of that house into sorrow, for the Kings countenance was chaun|ged, his thoughts troub|led, his Princes astonish|ed, his Musitians silen|ced, his seruants amazed, their delightfull drink|ing became despised, and all the house disordered: and in a worde, his Ban|quet concluded with a cuppe of wrath, sent to him from the Lord: so

is it vnto all the wicked; the smallest signification of death interrupts their greatest ioyes, and causes them with the Peacocke, looking to his feet, let fall the proude feathers of their hie concetes with|in their owne mindes, what euer they pretend in countenance. As is the noise of thornes vn|der the potte, so is the laughter of fooles, saieth Salomon,Eccles. 7.8. both the one and the other quickely vanishes: and death like that worme, which eated vp the gourd of Ionas, deuoures at length all

their Worme-eaten plea|sures, and then woe be to them, When all these fat, and excellent things,Reu. 18.14 af|ter which their soule lu|sted, are departed from them, and not so much as any hope of better re|maines vnto them: But vnto the Christian, death can doe no more but de|molish this parpen wall of clay, within the which the soule is captiued for a time, it opens the doore of the prison, and giues li|berty to the soule, to goe out and returne to her Maker, as shal at greater length appeare in the

Treatis following, which I haue offered, and pre|sented to your Honour, partly to testifie my vn|feined affection toward you in the Lord; for that vnfeined and incorrupt loue, which in so corrupt a time ye haue alway car|ried toward the truth of the Gospell, and by which also ye haue liued, as rare examples of pietie and loue,  godly liberality, and partly that ye may be remembred of these in|structions concerning life and death: wich ye receiued from vs by hea+ring, during your resi|dence

with vs, and vnto the practise whereof shortly ye must be called: for albeit it is not long, since it pleased the Lord beyond all expectation of man to deliuer you out of the handes of the Serge|ants  officers of death, which had violently sea|sed vpon you, and threat|ned to slay you both, your selfe by sickenesse, your Ladie by the sorrow of desolation, more heauie then death vnto her: yet are yee to knowe (and I doubt not, are preparing o for it) that the same battell will shortly bee re|nued

against you, wherin both of you must bee di|uorced from other, and diuided from your owne bodies, that yee may bee married and conioyne with your Lord, whom ye haue not yet seene,1. Pet. 1. but long to see him, because ye loue him, and reioyce in him with ioy vnspeak+able and glorious. And herein, if these little fruites of my Ministery may serue any way to con|firme you in the end, as some way they haue com|forted you in the iourney: and if for your sake they may bee profitable to o|thers

who, co~stantly keeps with you the same course toward the face of Iesus Christ, it shall be no small comfort vnto me, know|ing thereby that I haue not runne, nor laboured in vaine; for there is no thing in the world I de|sire more, then that I may put my talent to the vt|termost profite, fulfilling with ioy the Ministrati|on I haue receiued, and so may be welcommed of my Lord, as one who hath beene faithfull in little: But because all encrease comes from God, I humb|ly commend you, and al

that loue the Lord Iesus to the grace of God which is able to build you fur|ther, and giue you inhe|ritance among them who are sanctified by faith in Christ, and so rest
Your H. in the Lord Iesus M. William Cowper Minist. at Perth.






A DEFIANCETO DEATH. Mine helpe is in the name of the Lord.

2. COR. 5.1.
For wee know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle be de|stroyed, we haue a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternall in the heauens

_IT is appoin+ted (sayeth the Apo|stle) for all men once to die,As our death is, so shall our estate be af|ter it eter|nally. and it

is certain, that in what|soeuer estate we die, in it wee shall remaine; for where the tree fal|leth, there it shall lie (said Salomon). He that dies in the Lorde is blessed,Reu. 14.13. Eccles. 11.3 for he rests fro~ his labours, and shall remaine for euer in A|brahams bosom, which is the Paradice of God: hee that dies in his sins goes downe to the pri|son, out of which is no redemption, and shall neuer get licence to come backe to learn to die ouer againe,August. He|sych. Epist. 80 Qualis in nouissimo vitae

die quis que moritur, talis in nouissimo mundi die iudicabitur, such as eue|ry man dies in the last day of his life such shal he be iudged in the last day of the world.
It is therefore a spe|cial point of wisedom,Our life shold make our death good, and our death should make our resurrection happy. so to liue, that by liuing wee may learne to die, that a godly life may prepare the way to an happy death, and hap|py death may make vs sure of a ioyfull resur|rection: these three follow one vpon ano|ther inseparable; if the life be good, the death,

whateuer it be, cannot be euill: Nunquam mala mors putanda est,Aug. de ciuit De l. 1. c. 11. quam bona praecessit vita: and if the life be euill to the end, it is certaine the death cannot be good: for euen that Thiefe,If that our life be not first good, our death shall neuer be good, and be the con+trary. who was crucified with our Lord, before he got comfort in his death, was first amend|ed in his life, or vpon the Crosse was he con|uerted,  incontinent brought out the sweet fruite of righteousnes, accusing himelfe for his sinnes,Luke 23.40. rebuking the railing of his compani|on,

pleading the inno|cency of our Lord, gi|uing to God the glory of iustice, and praying to Christ for mercie, that he would remem|ber him, when he came to his Kingdome.
As it is comfortable in death to think vpon life,How the life and death of the godly each one of them helpe another. looking to Iesus, who for vs died before vs, and hath left this comfort to vs, who through death are to follow him,Ioh 11.25. I am the re|surrection and the life:Ioh 5.2. And againe, He that be|leeues in mee hath past from death to life: So is

it very profitable in our life to thinke vpon death, in our youth to remember the euill dayes and yeares ap|proaching vppon vs; wherein euery worke and secret thing must be brought to iudge|ment. Our Sauiour at the Banquet in Betha+nia had his conference of his death and burial: and Ioseph of Arima|thea had his Sepulchre in his Garden, both of them teaching vs to season the pleaures of our life with the re|membrance of our

death,Gregor. mo|ral. lib. 13. for Meditatio mortis vita est perfecta, quam dum iusti sollicite peragunt, culparum la|queos euadunt: The me|ditation of death is per+fite life, which while the godly carefully practise, they eschue the snares of sinne: and for this same cause Ber|nard commends the meditation of death,Bern. Tanquam summam Phi|losophiam, as the most high and profitable Philoophy that wee can learne in our life.The Apo|stles purpose and manner of proceeding her offers two things.
To this purpose the Apostle in this Trea|tise

deliuers to vs a most wholsome pre|seruatiue against the feare of death,1 Preserua|tiues against the eare of death. set down summarily in the first verse, and then drawes out of it three notable conclusions, which if wee can lay vp in our hearts,2 Instructions for a godly lie. shall learn vs to order our life well, and so serue as preparatiues to make our harts rea|die and capable of this comfort in death. The preseruatiue giuen vs in the first verse, is the certaine knowledge of a better estate, into the which we shalbe trans|lated

by death. In hand+ling of this, he first sets downe the losse wee haue by death: it is no more but a dissolution of our earthly Taber|nacle: and then sub|ioynes the vantage we get by it: to wit, that wee are entred into a better building, giuen of God, not made with handes, but eternall in the heauens, and so lets vs see, that the vantage wee receiue by death, doth farre exceede the losse that we susteine by it.
We know, He first af|firmes

it as a thing not doubt|some but certaine,Two waies know we that a better e|state abides vs after death. and well enough knowne, that by death wee are translated into a better estate: the warrants of our knowledg are two; for first wee know it by the reuelation of the worde,oh. 14.2. In my fathers house are many dwelling places, I goe to prepare a place for you. Our so|iourning place is on earth, our Mansion place in heauen: And next we know it by the perswasion of faith, which is proper onely to Gods elect children

effectually called.
And of this we learn how the Christia~ man onely walketh in light,Onely the Christian walkes in light, the rst of the world are in dark|nesse. where al the rest of the world are groping in darkenesse, in their life wandring after vanity, and in their death de|parting comfortles or at least doubtsome, and vncertain where-away to goe: Something they knew by experi|ence of the vanity of this life, for the which some of the naturall Philosophers, did think it was Optimum non nasci, and others, as He|raclitus

was moued to mourning by euerie thing which hee saw,Naturalists knew some thing of mans misery in the body, but had no certaine knowledge of a better life. but certaine knowledg of a better life to come they haue not,  there|fore in their best estate goe doubting (as I said)  lamenting out of the bodie, as did that Emperor Hadrian, like a wilsome man, not knowing whither to goe, Animula Vagula, blandula, quae nunc abi|bis in loca? And no mar|uell, he being destitute of the light of the word, and taught by his Master Secundus the

Philosopher, that death was incerta peregrina|tio, an vncertaine pere|grination.
And truely no bet|ter is the co~fort,The doctrine of the Romsh Churchleaues her disciples comfortlesse in death. which that Step-mother the Church of Rome gi|ueth to her children, for shee sendes them a|way out of the world without any assurance of saluation, and keeps them in suspence with a vaine hope of helpe to bee sent vnto them, for their deliuerance from the paines of Pur|gatorie, by soule Mas|ses, and such like rotten

caddle as must be made for them when they are dead, vppon their owne or their friends expences. And in this all the bastard Religi|ons of the world are a|like, that they render no solide comfort to their professours in death. Neither can it bee otherwise, for see|ing they are not vpon the Foundation Iesus Christ, in whose merits onely wee get life, who are dead in our selues; what maruel if they die oppressed with doubt+ings and fearefull des|paires.
But as to vs we know who~ we hauebeleeued,It is other|wise with the Christian taught by the word os God.  that whe~ our course is finished  our battel ended, a crown of righ|teousnes shall be giuen vnto vs: we know that the day of our death is but the day of our cha~g from the worse to the better. And this should animate vs to co~stancy  perseuerance in god|lines, because wee goe not like vncertain men carried vpo~ vaine hope to an vnknown end, but before ha~d we are both forewarned  certified of the'nd wherunto we

are called: why then shall wee linger in the way, and suffer our spi|rits to bee discouraged with doubting of the euent.
It is the praise of A|braham the father of the faithfull,Abraham followed God calling to a countrey which h knew not. that albeit hee knew not the land, whereunto God called him, yet he obeyed the calling, and willingly forsooke his natiue countrey and kindred, being assured the word of God could not be|guile him, and that the Lord neuer biddes his children exchange but

for the better: And we certainly are vnworthy to bee accounted the children of Abraham,How much more should we, being called to  Countrey which we know. if wee refuse ioyfully to follow the heauenly vocation, considering the Lord hath foretold vs, or euer we goe out of the body, of a better building into which we shall bee translated. Let them doubt and feare, who knowe not of a better: let vs giue glory to him that hath called vs, and through the valley of death hee shall lead vs to eternall life.
That if, The Apo|stle speakes not this doubtingly, as if it were vncertaine whe|ther our bodies were to bee dissolued, or not, but by way of concession, hauing in it a stronge af|firmation: as if hee did say, albeit it bee so, that the earthly house of our Taber|nacl must bee dissol|ued,Some godly men beore vs haue been taken away, and their bodies not dissolued by death after the common manner. yet are wee sure of a better. It is true that in the ages before vs, there hath beene some of Gods Saints, whose bodies

were not dissolued by death after the com|mon manner: before the flood HENOCH was taken away, and hee sawe no death: after the flood ELI|IAH was transported into a Chariote of fire: and strange is it that is written of MOSES,Deu. 34.7. that when hee died on the toppe of Psgah, beeing an hundred and twentie yeare olde, his eye was not dimme, nor his naturall force aba|ted.
But we haue not vp|pon

these to fansie vn|to our selues a priui|ledge,But we must not dreame of any such priuiledge to our selues. whereof God hath not assured vs, nei|ther are wee to thinke wee are the lesse belo|ued of God, because af|ter the same singular maner, he takes vs not away out of the world, but we must looke on the other hand to the remanent Patriarches, Prophets and worthie ApostlesBut must looke to other of the Fa|thers who ded the common course of death. who finished their daies as Ioshua speakes, after the way of all flesh: so Abrham the father of the faith|full died, being worne

with the infirmities of his age,Gen. 27.1. and Isaac tho|rough weaknes waxed blinde before he died: and Iacob that famous Patriarch,Gen. 49.33. being in his bed, by ordinary death pulled vp his feet vnto him: and we must bee content after the same manner to suffer the dissolution of our bo|dies by diseases, which are the Sergeants and officers of death.The godly al|so aliue at Christs com|ming shal not be dissolued.
It is true also that they who shalbe found aliue at the second comming of Christ shall not be dissolued

but suddenly trans|changed: but this pri|uiledg in like maner we are not to looke for, ha|uing no warrant that we shall continue alike vntill that day, for that man of sinne is not yet so weakened by the Gospell as hee must bee:But we haue no war|rant that wee shall be of that number. Neyther are our eldest brethren, the Ie|wes conuerted to the faith of Christ, as in likelihood they wil be, before Christs second appearing: Sixteene hundred yeares were they in the couenant, when we were strang+ers

from it: During that space sundrie of the Gentiles in sun|drie partes of the World became Pro|selytes, as Naaman in Syria, and Ebedmelech in Ethiopia:For before Chrits com|ming the Iwes must be recalld. but that was not the accom|plishment of the pro|mised calling of the Gentiles, till the bodie of IAPHETS house were perswaded to dwell in the Tentes of SEM. And now other sixteene hun|dred yeares haue wee beene within the coue|nant,  they strangers

from it: in which space sundry of them also haue embraced the faith of the Gospel, but that (as wee conceiue) is not the performance of the promised recal|ling of the Iewes, but the body of that peo|ple shall be conuerted, that the prophecy may be fulfilled,Rom. 11.24. And there shall be one Shephe|ard, and one Sheepe folde: then shall our Lord appeare the se|cond time for our full redemption.It is out of al doubt, our bodies must be dissolued by death.
So that these words of the Apostle doe not

make any peraduen|ture of our death, farre lesse doe they giue vs a|ny exemption from death, but rather as|sures vs that our bodies must be dissolued. Our life on earth is no inhe|ritance,Heb. 13.14 our breath is but a vapour, wee haue heere no continuing Citie: Men may preasse to repine,Al fortifica|tion against death is in vaine. and sit the summonds of death, made by sundrie disea|ses as long as they can, and do all they may to fortifie themselues a|gainst the dart of death, but it shall not bee es|chued.

These daintie women which wil not suffer so much as their soles to touch the earth,Deu. 28. must at length lay down not the soles of their feete onely, but the Crowne of their head also to be couered by it. The labour of man in his life is to turne ouer the earth in the sweate of his brow, seeking in her bowels food and fewell, mate|rials for building, and Mineralles of sundrie mettals for his other vses; in all which shee renders to man her ser|uice,

receiuing at le~gth for a recompence, man in her bosome, to fil vp her wants, whose finest flesh, is turned by her without difficulty into dust.
If we were as Ada~ who neuer saw one die be|fore him by the course of nature (for Abel was take~ away by violence) it were somwhat more tollerable then now it is,As Adam was the first liuing man, so the first that died by the course of nature. to doubt whether if, or not, wee shall bee dissolued. It was threat|ned against him, that if he brake the comman|deme~t, he shold die, yet

after the transgression he liued, a bodily life I meane, nine hundred and thirty yeares, euen to the eight generati|on; a father of many children in both the houses of Caine and Seth: as he was the first man that liued in the world, so it seemeth he was the first that died by the ordinary course of nature.But now so many haue gone through death before vs, that it is a shame for vs to scare at it But now death is become Via trita, a paide gate: All generations of men since the beginning of the world haue walked through it, Patriarchs,

Prophets, Apostles and all that Congregation of the first borne, who stand as witnesses, that there is no danger in death, and shal we one|ly scare at it, and stand affraid, as though it would deuoure vs: yea euen the very Ethniks esteemed death to bee Non supplicium,Seneca. sed tri|butum viuendi, Not a punishment but a tri|bute which euery man must pay for his life; and therefore said one of them, Quod debeo paratus sum soluere, vbi me faenerator appellat:

I am ready to pay my debt, when he who lent mee it shall call vppon me, and require it: And if notwithstanding o al this we liue in securi|tie, as if we were in co|uenant with death, and it would not long come neere vs, in verie truth wee deserue that we should perish in it.
By the earth|ly house our body here is to be vnder|stood.Our earthly house. Som|time both the soule  bodie of man are com|pared to an house, and that is in regard ofGod dwelling in them by his spirit: but heere by

th house the bodie a|lone is to bee vnder|stood, in regard of the soule that soiournes in it: and this is cleare in that also he calles it an earthlyhouse. And here wee haue three things to consider: First, that the bodie is called a house: next a house of earth: and thirdly, a Tabernacle, and the reasons why.For two cau|ses is our bo|dy called an house.
Our bodie is called an house for two re|spects:I For the cm|ly and order|ly workman|ship thereof. first in respect of the comely and or|derly work-manshippe thereof: for as Artifi|cers

out of an inordi|nate heape of things a|massed together, do rais vp most pleasant buil|dings, by walling out one of them from ano|ther, by preparing the~ and placing euery thing in the owne roome, and making them by line, and mea|sure one, of them pro|portionall and answe|rable to anoher: so that now they make vp a comely house, pleasant to looke vnto, wher before they were a dissordered masse. So is it with the body of

man, which of a confu|sed lumpe of clay with|out forme, God hath builded vp in this plea|sant forme and comely order, wherein now it stands.
It is true,Other crea|tures were made by the word of God, but to the making of man God put too his hand also. al the works of God are very won|derfull, what euer is done by him, cannot bee but very excellent and good, hee himselfe being most excellent and infinitly good. But a singular wisedome  goodnesse hath God showne in the creation of man, for hee came out in the last roome

as the perfection of Gods workes, and last design of the thoughts of God: and therefore was he not created af|ter the common order, which God obserued in the rest: for where other creatures were made by his word one|ly, he puts too his hand to the making of man, Consultation also a|mong the persons of the blessed Trinity go|ing before,And consul|tation among the persons of the blessed Trinity goes before. which was not in the creation of any other creature, whereof thou mayst learne,Basil hexam. hm. 10. O man, Quanti+tu

vnus venias estman|dus, in what great ac|count thou art in re|gard of all the rest of his creatures: all o|ther like seruants were brought out by naked commandement,Tortul. de re|sur. car. homo tanquam eorum dominus ipsa Dei manu est instru|ctus, Man as their Lord is built vp by Gods owne hand.
All this preparation going before,This prepara+tion before shewes that some great thng was to follow, as it did indeed. was to shew that some great thing was to follow, as indeede it did: for man is so made a worke of God his wisdome, that

he is a compend of all Gods creatures, ad|mired by those who had no more but na|tures light, as a little world, but more high|lycommended bythose who had also the light of the word whereby to discerne him Omni miraculo quod fit per ho|minem,Aug. de ciuit. Dei. l. 10. cap. 12. maius miracu|lum est ipse homo: Man himselfe, said Augustine is a greater miracle, then any miracle that euer was done by man.Man an ex|cellent work|manship euen i respect of his bodie.
And this not one|ly in regard of his soule

but euen of his bodie also, which here the A|postle calleth a comely house: If there were no more to commend it, yet, as saieth Gregory, this wereenough, Quod a corpore humano in se similitudinem trahat de|us,Gregor. m|ral. l. 32. Sect 13. That God borrows Similitudes from the body of a man to ex|presse and shaddowe himselfe vnto vs: a scri|bing to himself an eye, a mouth  a hand, and such like, which we are not to thinke with the Anthropomorphites, that hee hath per natu|ram,Bernard.

sed per effectum.
A short view of the excelle~t workmanship of mans body as it is giuen by Salomon. But beside this if we doe take but a short view of the workman|ship of man his bodie, we shall be compelled euery one for himselfe to say with Dauid, O Lord I am fearefull and wonderfull made.Psal. 139. The entrie to this house is the mouth, which God hath fenced with a fol|ding doore of the lips, opening and closing most commodiously at the will of the In|dweller. Next vnto it are the grinders which God hath set in the

entrie to prepare food for the whole man to nourish him: the third roome hee hath assigned to the tongue, which he hath made most artificially, and set in the thorough gate of the houe as the Trenchman and Messenger of the soule to declare his will vnto all that come neere: And he ht set the head as an emi|nent Towre in the bodie, wherein hee hath placed the seat of foure most excellent senses, euery one o

them neere vnto ano|ther, and not one of them impeding the function of another, he hath locked vp the brain within it, as a trea+sure, and fenced it not onely with a couering of haire, of skinne, and of bone without: but hath also spread ouer it within the Golden Ewer the least rupture whereof importeth death: and because the windowes,Man euen in regard of his body is a world of wonders. and watchmen are also in it, hee hath made it to turne like a Wheele pleasantly and without

paine, to preuent all dangers that from any side may come vnto the body: and if wee shall yet goe further in into this house, and consider the daughters of singing, which hee hath made most artifi|cially for modulation of the voice: if wee looke to the siluer cord stretched throughout the length of his body; if we co~sider the Well, how it prepares and furnishes blood to all the members of the bodie: if wee looke to the Pitchers, by which

as thorough Conduits it is conueyed through the whole body. If we consider the Cesterne which is the heart, the fountaine of life: if this manner of way, I say, with Salomon, we view the building of mans body, beside other in|numerable thinges which Naturalists and Theologs haue marked concerning it;Eccles. 12. wee shall bee compelled to acknowledge that man euen as concerning his body is a world of won+ders.
And this haue I but

briefly marked,VVe should not dshonour the bodie which God hath honou|redso highly. that wee might learne to possesse our vesselles in honour, acounting it a great shame vnto vs, to pollute and defile this bodie in a|ny dishonorable man|ner, which GOD hath created so hono|rable, comely and plea|sant.
Secondly,2 The bodie is called a house in re|spect of the soule dwel|ling in it. The bo|die is called an house in respect of the soule, which dwelles in it: and this also highly commends the excellencie of the workemanshippe of

man, marueilous for the substances, wherof it consists, more mar|ueilous for the won|derful vnion and con|iunction of them: in heauen there are vn|dersta~ding spirits with|out bodies,Man for his two substan|ces whereof he consists, is a compend of all Gods creatures. as Angels: In earth are bodies without vnderstanding spirits, as beastes; in man ye shall find them both; wherefore one affirmed man to be all things, for there is no creaure which liues, but man partakes of the lie thereof, the plants and trees haue a

life vegetiue, by which they grow, the beastes a life sensitiue, by which they heare, see, smell, taste and touch: the Angels a life reasona|ble, by which they vn|dersta~d: in the first two man co~municates with earthly creatures: in the third he transcends them, and is compani|on to Angels.But the con|iunction of these two substances is more mar|ueilous.
But the coniuncti|on of these two sub|stances, and the habita+tion of the one into the other is yet more marueilous, common|ly the honourable and

the ignoble,Bern. in die  Natal. dom. er. 2. the foolish and the wise, thestrong  the weake, agree no better then Iron and Clay, Non sic in opere tuo, non sic in commixtio|ne tua, O Domine: Not so in thy worke, O Lord, not so in the mix|ture which thou hast made: for heere the Lord hath ioyned in most maruelous man|ner Spirite with flesh, a heauenly substance with an earthly,Nazian. That flsh and spirit should agree so well to|gether. so that Communio haec mentis ad corpus inf|fabilis sit,  incompre|henibilis intellectu,

This communion of the minde and bodie can neyther bee con|ceiued by our vnder+standing, nor vtte+red by our speech, the soule being so in the bodie, that yet it is not mixed with the bodie, it is within vs, and yet goes tho|rough all things that are without vs,That the soule shuld be kept in the bodie by blood and breth, yet not liuing by them it is kept in the bodie by blood and breath, and yet liues not by blood and breath, beeing a Spirituall thing, it giues vn|derstanding to anie

other Spirite by the earthly Organ of the tongue, and receiues againe intelligence fro~ another spirite by the earthly Organ of the eare: God hath done it, we feele it, but know not the reason of it: all these and many moe hould moue vs to re|uerence the goodnesse and wonderfull wise|dome of our Maker, hewed in the creation of man.
Carnal men so liue as if they were nothing but flsh onely.And of this we learn how farre the iudge|ment of Gods spirite, differs from the iudge|ment

of man, and that euen as concerning man himselfe: It is thought among car|nall men, that the body is the man, Sic dediti sunt carni ac sanguini, ac si nihil aliud, quam carnem se esse reputa|rent: and therefore are they so giuen to pam|per flesh, as if they were no other thing but flesh: these do not separate the vile from the pretious,Ierem. 15. the Lord from the seruant, the indweller from the lodger, or in the iudgment of Gods spi|rit,

the body is no more but the house:VVhreas the body is but the house, the man is he who dwels in the bodie. the man is hee that dwelles in the bodie; and looke what difference there is betweene a house and him that dwelles in it, such are wee to put betweene the soule, and the body: in exte|riall dangers thogh the house bee burnt and blowne downe with windes, if the indweller be safe, we account that the losse is the lesse, and much more if the soule escape when the house of the body is throwne downe by death, are

we to esteeme that the losse is but small: It is reasonable indeed,Let vs so care for the house, that much more w re for him who dwls in it. that the soule should loue the body, but so that it neglect not the owne selfe: let Aam loue his Euah, but so that hee hearken not vnto her voice more then to the Lords: if we seeke the welfare of our bodies, with neglect of our soules, we shall lose the~ both, but if we subdue the body by discipline, that the soule may be safe, then shall the bo|dy also bee partaker of her glory.
The bodie is called an earthly house.Earthly. The second general obserued here, is, that the Apostle cals our body an house of earth: and this he doth for two causes: first in regard of the matter, for it was made of the earth: next in regard of the means by which our bodies are conti|nued, and vpholden, for they are earthly.
First, because it was made of the earthAs to the first, that man is made of earth, which is manifest out of the second of Genesis, it doeth highly com|mend the great power of the Creator: to doe

great thinges by great meanes is no great matter; but when by smallest meanes great+est things are done, it doth argue without all doubt the great excel|lency of the worker, as that God made all things of nothing, and that of the basest mat|ter he had made before man,And herein appeares Gods power and wisdome that of so base a mat|ter hath made so ex|cellent a creature. hee made man a more excellent crea|ture, then any other that hee had brought out before him; hee made him of clay, but in many respects more honourable then that

whereof he made him,  in this that he hath giuen to man, Vt sit aliquid sua origine glo|riosius,Tertul. de re|surrect car. Hee hath set out the glorie of his pow|er and wisedome: As likewise in that hee hath placed such a Grace and Maiestie in that same face, which hee framed of Clay, that the feare and terrour of him was vppon all liuing creatures,Gen. 2. which they acknowledged by their first comperance be|fore him at his cal|ling to receiue names

from him as it pleased him to improue them, and yet euen after the fall, by the bene|fite of restitution, wee haue in CHRIST, they so reuerence man, that albeit in nature there can bee none stronger then the Elephant, stowter then the Lyon, fier|cer then the Tygre: yet all these dooth seruice to man, Et naturam suam huma|na institutione depo|nunt.Ambros. hexam. l. 6. cap. 6.
Secondly we learne heere GODS Soue|raignty

ouer man,The soue|raignty of God ouer man, is more thn that which the Potter hath ouer his clay. he is but a vessell of earth, framed by the hand of God  therfore VVoe must be vnto him, if he striue with his Maker: a vessell of clay is not so easily broken by the Potter, as man is con|founded by his Maker, if once his wrath kin|dle in his breast against him. It were therefore good for man before hee enter into enmitie with God, to bethinke himselfe of an answere to that question of the Apostles,1. Cor. 10.22 Do ye prouoke God vnto anger, are yee

stronger then he?Therefore wo to him who liues in n|mity with God. The Sidonians would not make warre with He|rod, because they were nourished by the kings land; and it might more iustly be a reason to keep vain man from waging battel with the Lord,Act. 12 20. that he holds his life of the Lord,  that if he do but take his breth out of our nostrils wee fal incontinent as dead vnto the ground. Sure|ly of all follies in the world this is the grea|test, for a man to cast himselfe in danger of Gods wrath, which he

is neyther able by fly|ing to esche, nor yet by suffering to endure.
The conside|ration of our originall does lerne vs humility.Thirdly, the conside|ration of our originall learnes vs humility, sice wee are of the earth, why shal we wax proude, specially for a|ny quality of our body, which was taken from the earth, and must re|turne to earth againe? Therefore God gaue vnto the first man the name of Adam, signify|ing redde earth, that as oft as hee heard his name, he might reme~|ber his originall, and

and his posterity also, considering the Rocke fro~ whence they came, might let fall the comb of their naturall pride.
Which if we cannot learne,They who will not learn it by their o|riginall, et them looke to their end, and they shal see no cause of pride. by looking to our originall, let vs at least reme~ber our end,  it shall learne vs, that we are but dust: yea much more vile then common dust, for as beautifull Snow, when it is resolued into water whereof it was congea|led, becomes fouler water then any other else, so man being tur|ned again into earth, it

becomes viler earth then any other earth whatsoeuer: so that the flesh which in life is most beloued, death causes to be most ab|horred:Gen. 23.4. Abraham lo|ued Sarah well, but fro~ the time that her soule departed from her bo|die, hee was glad to en|treate the Hittites for a Sepulchre, that hee might burie his dead out of his sight. And truely,Greg. moral. l. 16. sect. 105 if, as Gregory councels vs, Vnusquis hoc quod viuum diligit, quid sit mortuum pensa|ret: euery man would

pondr, what that crea|tur is being dead, which so greatly man loueth, while it liueth, it would serue to represse in vs the immoderate desires of our affections.
O man,Neither is there strength nor beauty, nor stature of the body to be delighted in. why wilt thou bee bewitched with that which in the bodie seemes worthy to bee loued? Is it for the strength, or the beautie or stature ther|of, that thou art deligh|ted with it? I pray thee consider what these are: Is not the strength of the body weakenes? Ere it be long the gras|hopper

shall be a bur|den to the strongest: And as to beauty, is it not deceitfull?Esa. 40.6. All flesh is grasse, and the glorie thereof as the flowre of the field.The body like a wall of clay. plaste|red ouer and painted with colours. As a wall of clay plastered ouer, and painted: after that a little winde and raine hath beaten vponit, the Lime fals away, and the clay appeareth: so is it with the most pleasant bodie, which now be|ing trimmed with the colours of God seemes very beautifull, but af|ter that the storms and showers of diseases

hath beaten vppon it: then shall it appear that which it is, to wit, but Clay indeede; and though for stature thou were like to the sonnes of Anack, yet neither art thou for that the more pretious: for the high|est trees are not most fruitfull,Esa. 14.11.19. the mightie Oakes of Basan beares fruit for Swine, where the little Vine-tree renders comfortable fruite for man, neither can thy height protect thee against death, for euen gold thristy Babel

which grewe vp like a great tree, so high that the fowles of heauen made their nests vnder it, was at le~gth broght to the graue like an ab|hominable branch: so shall it bee with the pompe of all flesh, the wormes shall be spread vnder thee, and the Wormes shall couer thee.
Remm|brance of that which we haue bin, should keepe vs from wax|ing proud for that which we ar.Let it therefore bee farre from vs to glorie eyther in the strength or beauty, or stature of our mortall bodies: they are but rotten and ruinous habitations;

nothing is there in them to puff vp our pride, if we consider them aright, but much matter to humble vs. It is written of Agatho|cles, who of a Potter was made a King, that he caused to furnish his table with vessels, some of Golde, and some of Loame, that by the one he might be serued as a King, and by the other admonished that hee was once a Potter: and it much more becomes vs, who now are called to the high dignity of the sonnes of God, to

remember what wee were before, that so we may bee humbled in our selues,  be thank|full to our God.
Secondly, the bodie is called an earthly houe,Secondly, the bdy is cal|led an earth|ly house be|cause it is vphoden by earthly meanes. because by earthly meanes it is susteyned and vphol|den, so that the verie food by which we liue dooth warne vs of the fragility of our mortall bodi, the fowles of the ayre, and beastes of the earth are slaine to feed vs, they must quit the silly life they haue, be|fore they can bee con|uenient

foode for vs: And I pray you, what enduring life can they cause vnto vs, which must die before they can helpe our life: yea within short time, if they bee let alone, they corrupt and putrifie of their owne accord: thus e|uerie creature that feedes vs, testifies to vs in their kinde, that our life is but a silly life, the ende whereof is death and filthy rot+tennesse.
Of this Tabernacle: the third generall point we

marked heere is:Our body is called a Ta|brnacle, first because we haue here a couering, but not a founda|tion. how our body is called a Tabernacle: And that first for some similitude of the building, a Ta|bernacle being such a soiourning place, as Tectum habeat non fun|damentum,Ber. parui Sermones. hath a co|uering, but not a foun|dation, to warne vs, that how euer in this life we haue aboue vs the protection of God,Esa. 4.6. as a Couert for the storme and for the raine, yet be|neath there is heere no foundation, whereon we may rest,Heb. 11. and settle our selues: but we are

with Abraham, Isaac and Iacob, to looke for that Citie aboue, ha|uing a Foundation: that is, our Temples building, in which without danger, wee may lay vp our trea|sure, hauing both a roofe  a foundation, fundamentum est stabili|tas aeternae beatitudinis,Ibid. tectum consummatio  perfectio ipsius.
Secondly, our bo|dies care called Taber|nacles in regard of the vse of them,Scondly, be|cause we should vse it as a Sconse or Tent for the warfare. since our life is a warfare, wee should soiourne in the

body, as souldiers in their Sconses  Tents, that out and in them wee may watch for vantage ouer our ene|mies, to annoy them, and defend our selues from them: but it is to bee lamented that our bodies, which should be vsed as Tabernacles for warre,Basil. ser. 10. in Psal. qui habitat. are turned in domicilia turpissimae cap|tiuitatis, in little houses of seruitude  bondage
Thirdly, be|cause it is not fixed in one place, as an house, but is made for transporting.And thirdly, to shew their mortality, they are compared to Taberna|cles, for they are moue|able at the will and ar|bitrement

of God, who hath pitched them, we haue here no continu|ing City, but should liue in the body, as rea|dy euery houre to bee transported, for wee know not when it shal please the Lord to pull vp the stakes of our Ta|bernacle, to slake the cordes, and folde vp the couering therof, which shortly must bee done to euery one of vs: but our comfort is, that as the Arke of God, which in the Wilder|nesse dwelt in a moue|able Tabernacle, was

afterward placed in a fixed and stablished Temple in Canaan: so our soules shall bee translated from this earthly Tabernacle to haue their dwelling in that Temple of God in heauen Great ioy was in Ierusalem, when Sa|lomon transported the Arke from the Taber|nacle to the Temple, but greater ioy shall be to our soules, when God shall carrie them from this earthly Tent, to that heauenly and e|ternall habitation.
Be dissolued. Heere

we see, that in the Chri|stian, death dooth no more, but dissolue his earthly Tabernacle.That death whrein all deaths con|curre, is the proper pu|nshment of sinne. It is demaunded by Au|gustine, what kinde of death it was, which God denou~ced to man in paradise, if he did eat of the forbidden tree,Aug. de ciuit. Dei. l. 13. cap 12. Vtrum corporis, an ani|mae, an totius hominis, an illa quae dicitur secunda: And he aunswers; that into that death, which is the proper punish|ment of sinne, all kinds of death concurres: for as the whole earth co~|sists, sayes he, of many

earths,  the Catholike Church consists of ma|ny particular Chur|ches, so vniuersal death, which is the proper pu+nishme~t of sin consists of all sorts of death.
Now the Scripture makes mention chief|ly of two sorts o death the first and second:Of the two kindes of death menti|oned in holy scripture. the first death hath in it two deaths, the one of the soule, the other of the body: the death of the soule is, when the soule quickening the body, is not quickened of God,Eph 4. but is as the A|postle speakes a stra~|ger

fro~ the life of God,  by this death many are dead, who in regard of their bodies seem to be liuing,Eph. 2. 2. Tim. Reuel 3. as is spoke~ of the Ephesians before their calling of the wa~|to~ widows who liuing are dead,  of the An|gel of Sardis: the death of the body is the sepa|ratio~ of the soule from the body.Death of the whole man, what it is. So then the death of the whole ma~ is, Cum anima sine deo  corpore ad tempus paenas luit but the se|cond death, which is so called, because by ma|ny degees it is greater

then the other: and there is not any other behinde it, is, Cum a|nima sine Deo, cum corpore aeternas paenas luit.
Where that we may yet more cleerely di|stinguish the death of a Christian from the death of the wicked, it is to be enquired,It is deman|ded seeing the soule and body of the wicked shll be vnied in the resurre|cton: how shall they be punished with the second death. see|ing in the resurrection the wicked shall haue their soules and bodies vnited together, how shall they be punished with death? The aun|swer is, that this vnion of their soules and bo|dies

shall be with such a fearfull diuision from God,  among them|selues, that they shall rather wish to be extin|guished, and turned in|to nothing, then be v|nited againe,Gregor. mo|ral. l. 15. Sect 55. Ad aug|mentum tormenti,  hic de corporenolens edu|citur impius,  illic in corpore tenetur inuitus. In this life the wicked is taken out of the bo|dy against his will, and in the life to come, hee is kept in the bodie a|gainst his will: and by both of these his tor|ment is encreased: In

the first creation God conioyned soule and body; that they might be a mutuall comfort one to other,It is answe|red that this nion of their oule and bo|dy, is for their greater punishment. but in the second death by the co~trary they are vnited for the mutual punish+ment one of another: so that the body shall bee for no other ende quickened by the soule but to make it feeling, and sensible of horri|ble paine: for if euen now in this life it bee come vpon man, as a iust punishment of his rebellion against God, that the body is not so

seruiceable to the soule as it was in the begin+ning, Anima quippe quia supriorem Domi|nu~ suo arbitrio deseruit,Aug. de. ciuit. dei l. 13. c. 13 inferiorem famulum, sibi subiectu~ non habet, how much more shall it bee so in the last reco~pense that either of themshal become a griefe, and burden to others.
Here is then to bee taken vp that greate difference which is be|tween the death of the Christian and of the worldling,A great dif|ference be|tweene the death of the Christian and the wicked. in the death of the wicked, all sorts of deathes concurres,

hereas the Christian suffers but Aliquid mor|tis a peece of death, to wit, the dissolution of his earthly house: the Serpent can doe no more to him, but man|ducare terram eius, fa|sten his teeth vpon his earthly parte, as to the heauenly soule it falles not vnder the danger of death.
So that the vantage is greate, which the Christian hath ouer his enemies,The Christi|an shall ne|uer die that death which is the punish|ment of the wicked. in that the death which the wic|ked shall die, the Chri|stian is exempted from

it, but that parte of death which hee shall suffer, and they are a|ble to inflict vpon him, they themselues shall shall not escape it. Ie|zabel may make her vow to haue the head of Elijah: but how lit|tle effect there is in such furie of flesh, is manifest in that same example,And the wic|ked cannot free them|selues of that death, which they inflict on the godly  beside that, a worse abides them. for God pre|serued his seruant safe, and her own head was giuen in a prey to the dogges, and they like the Burrios of the Lord deuoured her, leauing nothing but the skull

of her head, and palms of her hands: why then shall we bee affraid of them, who are not ex|empted from that doome, which in their greatest anger they giue vpon vs: when it was tolde Anaxagoras the Philosopher, that by his enemies meanes he was condemned to die, he neuer troubled himself for the matter, but made this answere: Iam olim istam sententi|am tulit natura in illos aeque ac in me, that long since nature had giuen out the sentence of

death vppon them, as well as vppon him. If such strength was in a|ny Ethnik, what should there bee in any Chri|stian?
But beside this,By death we get deliue|rance from our present euils. the excellent benefits wee receiue by death should confirme vs against all the terrors and paines thereof; for first it relieues vs of much euill: for by it our dayes of sinne are fi|nished, and wee are deliuered from the miseries of this life. If wee had beene immortall in this

this miserable mortali|ty, our estate had been most lamentable: euen the Ethniks by the light of ature vnderstood, that it was a great bene+fite that the bodie was but Mortale vinculu~ ani+mae,Aug. de. ciuit. Dei. l. 9. cap. 10. a temporal or mor|tall band of the soule; and they gaue the rea|son,VVhat a great benefit it is, that our bodies are mortall. Ne semper huius vitae miserijs anima te|ner etur, least the soule should be for euer de|teyned vnder the mise|ries of this wretched life: but praised bee God, this comfort is made sure to vs by a

clearer light, that our soules shall not for e|uer be deteyned in the bodie, as in a house of bondage, but that shortly they shall bee deliuered, and that in so wonderfull a man|ner, that death which is the daughter of sinne shall become the de|stroyer of her owne mother: for vnto the Christian, death is a perfite mortification of all his earthly mem|bers.
Neither are we by it onely deliuered from euill,By death we are set at li|bertie to en|ioy our grea|test good. but also entred to

the fruition of our grea+test good: for as a cloud dissolued giues vs cleare sight of the Sun, which before was ob|scured fro~ vs, or as the doors of the prison be|ing opened by the An|gel, made a faire way to Peter to come out and enter into Ierusale~, so is it,Aug. de. ciuit. dei. l. 9. c. 20., dissolutio corporis, ab|solutio est animae, the dis|solution of the body is the absolution of the soule: as the snare being broken, the bird esca|peth, so the body being dissolued,Athanas in qestionibus quaest. 18. Euadit reclu|sa intus columba hoc est a|nima,

the soule hath a readie way to the face of God.
There is wrought by death,Many lookes to the dissolu|tion, but not to the con|iuction made by death, and therefore are affraid at it. as saith the Apo|stle, both a dissoluti|on and a coniunction. The cause why death seemes terrible to ma|ny, is, for that they look to the dissolution, and not to the co~iunction, the dissolution is of the soule fro~ the body, the coniunction is of the soule with Christ: if the~ we be affraid, when wee looke to the disso|lution, let vs also looke to the coniunction,

and be comforted, I de|sire to bee dissolued, there the dissolution: and to be with Christ, there the coniunction. VVe vse commonly to call death a departure, and so it is a departure from them who are deere vnto vs, but to them who are more deere: and therefore should we not so much be grieued at our de|parture from that com|pany we leaue behinde vs, as reioyced by thin|king of that blessed fel|lowship, which is be|fore vs, for we returne

to our father, from whom we came, to our eldest brother, whom we haue not yet seene, but long to see him, because we loue him, to the company of in|numerable Angels, to the Congregation of the first borne, and to the Spirits of iust and perfite men.
But here two things must bee remooued,Two things remoued which make death feare|full. which impaire this comfort, and makes death seeme much more terrible,1 The feare of punishment after death then it is indeede. The first is the fear of punishment

after death, but in ve|rie deede, quid hoc ad mortem, quod post mor|tem est?Ambr. de bo|no mortis. c. 8 Why shall death bee blamed for that which falles out after death, Acerbitas non mortis est, sed culpae, the bitternesse is not in death,But indeede death is not to be blamed for thatwhich comes after it but in sinne: let a man therefore purge his conscience, and death shall neither bee fearefull, nor bitter vn|to him: As a Serpent wanting the sting, may be put in our bo|som without perrill, so if sinne, which is the sting of death be taken

away, wee may bold|ly welcome death, yea embrace it with|out feare: it cannot hurt vs.
The other cause is, that men apprehend death,2 An appre|hension that death de|stroyes man. to be the destru|ction of man, but in ve|ry truth it is not so, but rather as I said, the ab|solution of man, it is neyther totall, for it onely dissolues the bo|die, nor yet perpetuall. Some Ethnikes falsly called it, Aeternus Som|nus, it is a sleepe in|deed, but not eternall, for in the resurrection

the body shall bee wa|kened and raised vp a|gaine, so then Non mors ipsa,Ambros. ibid. Death it self is not terrible but the opini|on of death. sed opinio de morte est terribilis, it is not death it selfe, but an o|pinion of death which is terrible, for since it translates vs from this present euill world vn|to euerlasting life: I know not said Nazian|zen, how it can be cal|led death, it being No|mine magis, qua~ re sor|midabilis, fearefull in name,Nazian. orat. de funere patris. rather then in deede. The separati|on of the soule from God, that is death: the

separation of the soule from the body,Greg. moral. l. 4. sect. 47. Vmbra tantummodo est mortis, is onely the shaddow of death, and therefore such as are dead, not in he soule, but in the flesh, non vera morte, sed vmbra tantum mortis o|eriri dicuntur, are not said to be truely dead, but only couered with the shaddow of death.
VVe are not then to looke vpon death in the glasse of the lawe,Death should not be looked vpon in the glasse of the law, but in the mirrour of the Gos|pell. but in the mirrour of the Gospel: life looked vpon with the eyes of nature, seemes a better

thing then it is, coue|red as it were with a white vaile, though in deede it bee very blacke: for if the plea|sures thereof be com|pared with the paines, it will bee found that the paines exceede the pleasures, both for their number, greatnesse and conti|nuance, it being most certaine, that no plea|sure in the earth hath beene found to endure so long, as the paines of a feuer, whereas on the other hand, if death bee looked vpon with

the eyes of nature, it seemes to be very terri|ble,  as it were coue|red with a blacke vaile, but is white indeed, be|ing to the godly but a finishing of our mise|ries,  entrance to our endlesse glorie.
And this shall be e|uident if we mark these phrases by which the spirit of God describes death to vs in holy scripture:Comforta|ble phrases, by which death is de|scribed by the spirit of God. the death of AbrahamGen. 25.8. is called a gathering of him to his fathers:Deu 31.16. the death of Moses a sleeping with his fathers,Psal. 16.9. Dauid

calles the death o his bodie a resting of his flesh in hope:Luke. S. Luke calles the death of our Lord the time of his as|sumption:2. Pet. 1.14. S. Peter cals it the deposition of an earthly Tabernacle: Now I pray you, what here is terrible, vn|lesse to be gathered to our fathers, to let our bodies sleepe for a time, and rest in hope, that our soules may be assumed vp into hea|uen be terrible to vs.S. Paul ex|presses the nature of our death by thre simili|tudes.
But most cleerly doth S. Paul by three proper similitudes, expressethe

nature of death vnto vs; for first he compares it to the laying aside of an old rotten garment, in stead whereof, wee put on a better, teach|ing vs thereby, that as no poore man will grudge to lay aside his contemptible garment when a better is offe|red vnto him,1. He compares it to the changing of a garment. far lesse shold a Christian mur|mure, when God vn|cloths him of his cor|ruptible bodie, since he doth it, that hee may cloth him with a more excellent garment of glorie, and mmortali|tie.

Secondly, he com|pares the laying of our bodies in the graue to the sowing of seede in the earth,To the sowing of seed in the earth, tha it may grow a|gaine. 1. Cor. 15. teaching vs thereby, that suppose our bodies being coue+red with moulds rot  putrifie vnder the earth yet they shall spring vp again, and thefore we shold willingly render our bodies to the Lord that great husbandma~, to be dimpled like pic|kles of liuely seede by his owne hand, in any parte of the earth hee pleases, yea if it were in the bottome of the sea,

seeing the whole world is the Lords husban|dry, which he can cause to bring out fruite to him at his pleasure: At his word both the earth and water brought out to him liuing creatures which neuer had been: and shal we not thinke that at his word they wil render to him these creatures,3 To a flitting from one house to an|other. which haue bin before? And third|ly he cals it here a flit|ting from one house to another, a remoouing from our cot house on earth, to a Palace of glorie in heauen.
Albeit death be certaine, yet the time, place, and kinde thereo is vncertaineNow this being spo|ken vpon the worde Dissolued for our com|fort in death, somthing further must we marke out of it, for our prepa|ration to death: Howeuer death be most cer|taine, yet the Apostle speaks indefinitly of it, both in regard of the time, the place, and the kinde of death: it is out of al doubt, our bodies must bee dissolued, but wee know not when, nor where, nor how: in these three respects death is vncertaine.
As to the time of

our death,Many dreame of more daies the~ they haue  are far deceiued at the length. Aug. God hath hidden it from our eies, Nihil certius morte, ni|hil incertius hora mor|tis. Many goe out of the body, being disa|pointed as concerning the time, lipning and looking in their owne thought for a longer time, then they find or|deined for them. In this folly by nature wee are all followers of that rich man, who drea|med to himselfe that he had many daies to the fore, when in very deed hee had not one: for that same night his

soule was taken from him,Ber. de falla|tia vitae prae|sentis. Vita haec multiplici|ter illudit hominibus, longam se simulat, vt fallat.
Time of our death left vn+certaine to make vs the more vigilantAlway the vncertain|ty of death in regard of time, God hath done it in wisedome, to make vs the more carefull: Ignoratur vnus dies, vt obseruentur multi: Hee hath made one day vn|knowne, that many daies may be obserued If the good man of the house had known what houre the thiefe would come, hee would haue watched,  not suffred

his house to be digged through. Be ye therfore prepared: the house is the body, the theef that breakes it is death, the treasure thou keepst in it, is thy soule, therfore watch  pray: the con|clusion of the Parable telles vs, that God hath hid the houre of death from vs, not to snare vs but to stirre vs to vigi|lance, Ideo voluit horam mortis incertam esse,Gregor. vt semper sit nobis suspecta, God hath made the houre of death vncer|taine, because hee will haue it alway suspe|cted.
The life of man is but a life that turnes vpon seuen daies, and in one of them man must die.The life of man on earth, is but a life of sea|uen daies, how manie yeares soeuer he liue, yet hath hee but these same dayes multiplied vnto him: As he ther|fore, who hauing seuen seruants to serue him, if he be aduertised that one of the seauen will slay him; takes seruice from them, with the narrower obseration of euerie one of them, when they come by course to serue him: so man,Therefore shld he take heed to them all. whose life runnes vpon seauen dayes in the weeke, which toge|ther

with their shad|dowes serue him by course, since he is tolde that in one of them hee must die, and he knows not which it is, he shold the more carefully ob|serue them all, to liue holily, and godly in them: let all of them be passed ouer in feare: let none of them want their owne exercises of godlinesse, so shall we die peaceably, and with comfort in any of the~, wherein it shall please God to call vpon vs.
Secondly,The place of death vncer|taine. in regard of the place death is al|so

so vncertain, somehaue died in the wombe wherein they tooke life, some in the Cradle as the infants of Bethlem, some in the bedde, as Ishboseth, some in the Parlour, as Eglon, some on the stoole, as Ar|rius, some at the table, as Ammon, some in the Chappell as Sennache|rib, some in the Tem|ple,VVe can come to no place in the which some haue not died before vs. as Ioab: In a word, what place is there wherin we can come, in the which, or the like of it, some men haue not died before vs: and this to warne

vs, how in euery place we shold be prepared, Vbique te expectatmors,Bernard.  tu, si sapiens fueris, vbique cam expecta|bis.
Thirdly, the kinde of our death is also left vncertaine vnto vs,The kinde of death is also vncertaine, that for all deaths we might be prepared. that against all kinds of death wee may be prepared; there is one way by which we all come into the worlde, but many wayes by which wee goe out of it, for some die in the water, as Pharao, some in the fire as the King of Edom,

some by Lions as the disobedient Prophet, some by Beares as the railing children,VVe come all into the world by one way, but we go out of it by many. some by dogges, as cruell Ie|zabel, some by vermine as proude Herod, some by the sword, as swift Azahel, some smothe|red in the house as the children of Iob, some by the fall of a wall, as those eighteene men, slaine by Siloam To|wer, some by the cast of a stone as Abimelech, some of a paine in their head as the Shunamits sonne, some of a paine in their belly, as Antioc|hus,

some of a Gowte n their feete as Asa, ome by the priuate corruption of their owne distemperate hu|mors, some by distem|perature of publicke humours, which are corrupt lawes.
In a word,VVe should not much care for the kind of death but for the way we goe after death. so fraile a vessell is man, that easi|ly by innumerable wayes hee is broken: and all these haue we seene before vs, that for al them wee might be prepared, making rea|die our selues to die,  referring the kinde of our death to the good

pleasure of God,Aug. de ciuit. dei. l. 1. c. 11. Non est multum curandum, necessari morituro, qua morte moriatur, sed qu post mortem ire Com|pellatur, since of neces|sity wee must die, let vs not care much for the kinde of death, but rather of the way which after death wee are to goe: And for this cause, did our blessed Sauiour vnder|goe a cursed death, that euery death might bee made blessed to them who die in the faith of the Lord.
Be dissolued.Men should not be viole~t actors of their owne death, but patient suf|ferers. Last of all wee obserue here that the word which the Apostle vses, be|ing passiue, wee are taught, that men shold not bee violent Ac|tors of their owne death, but patient sufferers at the good pleasure of God: In all the Booke of God there is not asillable al|lowing selfe-murther: The law which forbids to kill, dooth first of all forbidde to kill thy selfe: I wil require (saith the Lorde) your bloode at the handes of Beastes,

at the handes of a man himselfe,Gen. 9. at the hands of euery brother will I re|quire it: And heereby that storie of the Mac|cabes,2. Mac 14. commending RAZIS,A selfe mur|therer neuer allowed, but condemned in holy scripre for selfe mur|ther may bee knowne to bee but a bastard breath, being so discor|dant fom the rest of Scripture, breathed by diuine inspiration of the holy Ghost. Eth|nikes counted it mag|nanimity in desperate troubles to dispatch themselues, but indeed it is pusillanimity; that is a great mind, which

can endure trouble with patience: and it is but a feeble spirit, which being impati|ent of trouble, seekes by selfe-murther to es+chue it. Properly did Ierome call such Mar|tyres slultae philosphiae. As to Samsons fact it was singular, no more to bee followed, then Abraham his offring of his sonne, or Israels po|licie in spoyling the E|gyptians, which had their owne warrants, but cannot warrant vs to transgresse the knowne and common

commaundements of God.
The second par o he verse con|teynes the vantage we aue by death.Wee haue a building. Now followes the se|cond part of the verse, conteyning the van|tage we get by that ex|change wee make in death, to wit, that by it wee are translated into a better building: where before we enter into the wordes, if it bee demaunded, what then? Is there no more to bee done to the bodie? When it is dissolued, must it lie still in Dust and Ashes? And haue wee no fur|ther

comfort concer|ning it?The comfort giuen here a|gainst death concernes the soule onely. The aunswere is, that the comfort which here is giue~ doth only concern the soule but if we wil conioyne with this, other places of Scripture, wee shall finde full and perfite comfort, both for bo|dy and soule.
For not only know wee that our bodies shall bee raised vp a|gaine in the last day,Comfort con|cerning the losse of our bodies by death is to be sought n other places of Scripture. but that when they shall sleepe in the graue, the holy Ghost who now dwelles in them shall watch ouer

them, to preserue them to immortality, from the time wee be dead, our bodies are negle|cted and forsaken of these, who loued vs most deerly in our life, after that they haue laid vs in the graue they returne to eate and drinke, and in their wonted manner to re|fresh themselues, and within short time they quit all remembrance of vs;The Lord will no for|sake that bo|dy, whih was the Temple of h spirit, ut will kepe the dst thereof. But as to the Lord our God, he will neuer nglect, nor for|sake, nor forget that body which he hono|red

to bee his owne Temple, dwelling in it by his holy spirite, but wil keepe the very dust thereof, till he restore it againe to life. An ex|ample whereof wee haue in the fauourable dealing of God with Iacob, who dyed in E|gypt, and was conuey|ed to Canaan by Ioseph and Pharaoh his Cha|riots,Icobs dead body honou|rably buried by God. yet vnto none of them wil God giue the praise of the buriall of Iacobs corps, hee is not ashamed to take to himselfe, according to the promise hee made

vnto his seruant, that he would not onely go with him downe to E|gypt, but also would bring him vp againe to Canaan, therby decla|ring how pretious in his sight the death of his Saints is, and how honorable he esteemes these bodies, which haue bin the Temples of his holy spirit.
Three things to be conside|red here.Now in these words wee haue three things to be considered: first, what is meant by this building: seco~dly, how saies the Apostle, that we haue it: Thirdly,

what are the proper|ties, by which it is de|scribed.
By this building some vnderstands that im|mortall and glorified body,The fist thing to be considered here, is, what is meant by this buil|ding. which shal be gi|uen vs in heauen: the same body in substance which now wee haue, but transformed, and made like vnto Christs glorious bodie, and indeede vnto it a|grees this description; for that body is of God not made with handes, not preserued by the helpe of secondarie meanes, as is this

body which was be|gotten by our father, conceiued by our mo|ther,By this buil|ding is not to be vnderstood our glorisied bodies, for those we get not till the resurrection. nourished and brought vp to the state wherein now it is, by the helpe of hands: and again, where this mor|tall body is a temporal Tabernacle, the im|mortall shall bee an e|ternall habitation. All these are true: but be|cause our soules shall not dwell in these bo|dies till the resurrecti|on, they cannot bee meant here by this buil+ding to the which wee are transported incon|tinent

after death.
By this building then wee are to vnderstand that place of glory,But that place of glory into which we are trans|ated aftr death. which in the third hea|uens God hath prepa|red for his children, cal|led in the Gospell the euerlasting habitations,Luke. and by our Sauiour his Fathers house,Ioh. wherin are many Mansions:Hebr. called by Saint Paul a Citie, hauing a founda|tion, whose builder and maker is God,Reuel. and by Saint Iohn called the New Ierusalem; a City hauing the glorie of God in it, a Citie

foure squared, in le~gth, breadth and height e|quall; a Citie wherein al the Citizens sees the face of God, through the streets wherof runs the water of life, and in euery side thereof the tree of life: this is the glorious building, into the which our soules are carried by Angels, so soone as they depart out of the body.
The second thing to be considered here, is, how saies the A|postle we haue this building.The second thing we proposed here to speak of, was, how is it, that the Apostle saies, We haue this building, hee saies not we shal get it,

but that presently wee haue it: The reason is, because presently wee haue the rights and se|curities: If worldlings account the~selues sure enough of earthly inhe+ritances, whe~they haue the charter,The reason is, because presently we have the rights and ecurities of it, which are, Charter, Con|firmation, Seazing and Possession. seazing, co~|firmation, and possessi|on of them, how much more arewesure of that heaue~ly building, who haue already receiued all these rights and se|curities thereof from the Lord our God.
The CharterOf the Char|ters of our heauenly building. of our heauenly inheritance is the good worde of

God, wherein the Lord of his speciall grace,  fauour hath disponed it vnto vs,Luke 12.32. Feare not lit|tle flocke, it is the fathers will to giue you the king|dome: besides that, the same is left to vs in le+gacie by our elder bro|ther Iesus Christ, who before that hee offered himselfe in a Sacrifice for our sinns vpon the Crosse,Most comfor|table Medi|tations. did first com|mend vs to his father by an euerlasting pray|er: Father, I will, that these whom thou hast giuen me, bee where I am, that they may see

the glory I had with thee from the begin|ning.Ioh. O most sweete, O most sure word: What sweeter word can there be thn this that the Sonne in his latter Will, will haue vs to bee with him: what surer word? It is spoken by him, in whom the Father pro|claimes himselfe to be well pleased, and who then will reuoke or an|null it? Surely most comfortable is it, that we haue not onely the Father bidding the son aske what he will,Psal. 2. and

promising to giue it: but wee haue also the Sonne asking, and in his asking crauing no other thing, but that we may be with him: Is not then our heauenly Inheritance sure en|ough vnto vs?
Of the con|firmation we haue recei|ued vpon our Charter.But we haue yet more beside this disposition made vs of God, strong Confirmations thereof, for the father hath co~firmed the dis|position, made by him with an oath,Heb. 6.17.  that as the Apostle saies, to shew to the heyres of promise, the stability of his Coun|sell.

Again, the Legacy made by the sonne, hee hath ratified by his owne bloode, and the death of the Testator interuening, hath made the Testame~t vnchang|able, and both of them are sealed in our hearts by the holy Spirite of promise, whom God hath giuen vs, as his witnes, his earnest, and his seale to assure vs of that which hee hath promised.
And thirdly,Of our sea|zing and in|uestment in our heauenly building. the Lord our God by his Ste|wards  seruants, who~ hee hath ordeyned to

gouerne his house, de|liuering to vs in the Sa|crament the Symbols of te body and blood of Christ Iesus hath thereby seazed vs, and giuen vs inuestment of our heauenly King|dome.
Of our pre|sent possession we haue of that buildingLast of all, hee hath put vs in present pos|session thereof, by deli|uering vnto vs the keys of the Kingdom, which are Faith and prayer, by which euery Christian enters in at the doore of that building, and gets familiar accesse to the Throne of Grace:

uppose he be on earth, he hath his conuersati|on in heauen, talkes fa|miliarly with God his father, and viewes, to the great delight of his soule, that glorious in|heritance, into the which after death hee knowes hee shall fully be perfited. In all these respects it is, that the Apostle here sayes, not only we shal haue, but wee haue (alreadie) a building in heauen.The 3 thing to be considered here is the description of the building wherein are foure things.
The Third thing to be considered heere, is the description of this building, wherein first

we see how the buil|der and maker thereof is said to bee God: Se|condly the maner ther|of, it is not made with hands: Thirdly, the en|durance thereof, it is e|ternal: and fourthly, the place thereof, it is in heauen.
First then that God is called the Author  maker of this building,Fist God is called the Authour and maker of this building, and theefore it must be a glorious house it leades vs to forethink with our selues, what a glorious and excellent building it must be. A|mong men theirworks are according to their power and greatnesse:

f Kings goe to build, they build Palaces, if they prepare banquets they make them royal, esteeming it no ho|nourable thing for them to do that which without difficultie may bee performed by the common sort of people.
When King Ahasue|rus made a banquet to shewe the riches and glory of his Kingdom,Ahasuerus made a royal banquet, in a very pleasant place, to shew his glorie. Esth. 1. and honour of his Ma|iestie, hee prepared it in a very pleasant place: the Court of the Garden of the Kings

Palace was decked with Tapestrie of white, greene and blew clo|thes, fastned with cords of fine linnen and pur|ple in siluer ringes, and pillars of Mrble, the beddes were of golde and siluer, vpon a paue|ment of Porphyrie, and Marble, and Alablaster in blew color, the ban|quet was made to his Princes of an hundred and twenty Prouinces,VVhat shall we then thinke of that building and banquet God hath pre+pared for declaration of his glory. and it lasted one hun|dred and foure score daies. Now if such pro|uision was made by a mortall man, to shew

his glory, what shal we thinke of that prepara|tion which the eternall God hath made for de|claration of his glorie; not into the vtter Court of his Palace, which is this visible world, but in the inner Court thereof, the hea|uen of heauens; not in a banquet to last for an hundred and foure score daies, but for euer and euer.The glorie of Sa'omons Temple may lead vs to consider of the glorie of our heauenly building.
Salomon built a Tem|ple, which was iustly counted the glory of the world: but God furnished vnto him

both the matter, for in his dayes he made gold as rife as stones, as also the engine, for hee gaue vnto Hiram and other Artificers to worke all manner cu|rious worke in Golde,1. K. 7.14. Siluer, Brasse: what e|uer was excellent in that building, was done by the wisedome of God in the Artificer, which is but a small sparkle of that infinite knowledge and wise|dome which is in God himselfe: yet seeing of these earthly materials with the small sparkles

of his owne light, such excellent workes haue beene done by men, as drawes others in admiration of them: may wee not thinke, that it is a worke farre surpassing in glorie, and aboue the reach of all our vnderstan|ding, which hee him|selfe without helpe of handes hath built in heauen for the com|fort of his children, and declaration of the honour of his Ma|iestie.
Beside this in iudging of the workes of God,

we must lay this for a sure ground that the inuisible works of God are alway most excel|lent. In man there is a soule and body,It is taken for a sure ule, that the inuisible works of God are most ex|cellent. both of them very beautifull workemanshippes, but that the invisible soule is a far more excellent workemanshippe then the visible body, ap|pears in this, that what|soeuer beauty, sense, a|gilitie, or any other worthy commendati|on the body hath, it hath it from the quick|ning vertue of the soule,This we may see in the workeman|ship of man. without which,

the most beautifull bo|die is, but for matter a lumpe of clay, for forme like an Idoll, ha|uing eyes, but see not, eares and hear not, feet and walke not.
And so is it in all the rest of Gods workes,The same is to be vnder|stood in the Fabric of this world, which is very plea|sant, and yet but a figure in respect of that which is aboue. the inuisible being e|uer more excelle~t then the visible: this Vni|uerse with the plenish|ing and furniture ther|of is indeede a comely workemanshippe: the Grecians called it  for the ornaments thereof: the Latines called it Mundus for

the cleanenesse, and tightnesse thereof, but the Apostle compa|ring it with that buil|ding which is aboue, calles it , because it is but a figure of a better, and more enduring substance, which is not seene.
The most pleasa~t part of this lodging,How farre this visible world is in|feriour to that invisible building. is the sylering thereof, the firmament: which God hath garnished with the Sun, Moone and Stars as it were with shining pearles, to giue light by course to all that dwell in it: yet is it no more

but the nethermost part of the Pauement of our heauenly Pa|lace: yea the Sunne, which now is the most pleasant and profita|ble creature that serues man in this present world, shall not haue that honour as to shine in that heauenly building: there shall bee no neede of Sunne nor Moone, there the glory of God shall be the light of that City: as lesser lights are obscu|red at the presence of greater, so shal all these created co~forts subiect

to sense, euanish, when God shall receiue vs in his euerlasting habita|tions, and he himselfe shall become al things in all vnto vs.
The 2. thing in this de|scription is the manner of the buil|ding.Not made with hands. The second part of this description points out the manner of the buil|ding, the house is built by God in such sorte, that no hand of man, nor any other creature did helpe him in it. It is the Lords praise, that he made and prepared that dwelling place for vs, before he made our selues: yea as our Sa|uiour

witnesses before the foundations of the world were laid;Mat. 25.34. The Lord hath prepa|red that house for vs, and also pre|pares vs for it and it is also his praise, that he makes and prepares vs for it, which two are very comfortably con|ioyned by the Apo|stle Saint Peter, that God reserues that in|heritance for vs in hea|uen, and keepes vs also by his power on earth vnto it: so that al hands are here excluded from the praise, eyther of the building, or yet of the obteyning of it by any thing that man can do, that the praise alonely

may bee reserued to God, who is both the builder  giuer of this house, to the children of his good will in Christ.
The glory of both the cre|ations belong to God only.The worke of the first creation God re|ioyces in it,  wil haue the glory thereof only giuen to himselfe: hee spake it to his seruant Iob to humble him: Where wast thou,Iob. 38.4. when I laide the foundations of the earth? declare if thou hast vnderstanding, who hath laide the masures thereof, if thou know? or who hath stretched the

line ouer it, c.? And much more are wee to thinke that the glory of the second creation, he will haue ascrbed to himselfe.
Of all his workes he craues no more but the glorie,Of all Gods workes he craes no more but the praise,  giues vs the profite. and is content that the fruit and bene|fite of them be ours: let vs giue vnto him that which he will not giue to any other, namly his glory,  co~tent vs with that which willingly he giues vs, he would not suffer Israel tothink or say that fortheir righ|teousnes, they were en|tred

in earthly Canaan, far lesse will he be content that our entrance to heaue~ly Canaan shold be ascribed to the righ|teousnesse of man, or that man should say, My right hand hath done it:Psal. 116. Not vnto vs O Lord, not vnto vs, but to thy name be the praise, thy hande hath made that building,  thine hande must also bring vs vnto it.
The third thing in the description of this building, is the eternity thereof.Eternall. It is thirdly described from the en|durance thereof, which is vnto all eternitie: Here we soiourne in a

Tabernacle, there wee shall dwell in a Mansi|on house: here there is a definite time of daies moneths and years as|signed to vs, our life on earth is but momenta|nean, wherein if wee speake as the trueth is,Our present life is but for a moment. we liue no more, but a moment at once, for the begunne time is past vnto vs, and wee are dead vnto it: the time to come is vncer|tain, and we cannot be said to liue vnto it; it is onely the present mo|ment, wherein we liue, which shortly is done,

and must giue place to an other, that so by moments, one of them succeeding to another, our silly life may bee prorogate heere vpon earth.
And to the same pur|pose belongs that me|ditatio~ of Basil,Basil. in Psal. 143. that our life on earth is finished by many deathes, for if we shall diuide our life into these four ages,Our life is fi|nished by many deaths. in|fancy, youth, manhood and olde age: Our in|fancy is dead and gone already wee may say with the Apostle, when I was a child I pake as

a childe, but to that e|state of childhood shall we neuer return again.
Our youth in like manner is past,This is made cleae by par|ting our life into oure ages, euery one whereof doth die be|fore we enter to another. and of it we may say with Da|uid, I haue beene young and now am olde, but what wee were shall we neuer be againe. Our manly age in like manner in most part of vs is finish|ed, or at least wearing away,  there remains no more in them, who are falsly named to be of longest life amo~g vs, but theiroldage, which shortly also by death

shall be abolished, the most parte of vs haue passed through three deaths alreadie,  haue no more but the last and weakest time of our life to soiourne vp|pon earth, but in hea|uen our life shall not be measured by daies, moneths nor yeares: our house there is eter+nal, our estate in glorie vnchangeable.
Since by na|ture wee loue a long life, and care for it, why wil we not loue an e|ternall life.And this should warn vs with all godly care to make sure to our selues the rights of that heauenly building, wherof I haue spoken:

If we once misse it, we shall neuer recouer it: and if once we get en|trance into it, we shall neuer any more re|mooue out of it: It is a shame that we should take so much pains for a long life on earth,  so litle for an eternall life in heauen; to pro|long our life on earth, what is it we leaue vn|done, that may helpe it? For this cause wee care for garments, wee prouide for nourishing meates, wee purge the body by medicines, but since nature hath lear|ned

vs to doe so much for a long life, what a folly is it that wee should remain so care|lesse as wee are of eter|nall life, notwithstan|ding that by the light of the Gospell we are taught, how by god|ly care wee might ob|taine it.
In Heauen.The last thing in the descrip+tion of this building, is the situaion thereof. In the last roome that building is described from the place whereunto it stands. Among men, buildings commonly are commended from their situation: and the Apostle to extoll

ours aboue all that are on earth, telles vs, that it is situate in hea|uen. The Lord hath not giuen vs with E|sau, the fatnesse of the earth to bee our por|tion, neyther hath hee set our Habitation a|mong Dragons: hee hath lifted vs vp into the place of Angels, from whence they fell by their pryde, euen there hath the humble suffring and obedience of our blessed Sauiour exalted vs, and set vs, as sayes the Apostle, in the heauenly places:

so that we may reioyce with Dauid. The lines are falne to me in plea|sant places,Psal. 16 and I haue a very faire Heitage.
Dwelling places assig+ned to men according to the dispositi|on of their persons.I find in holy Scrip|ture, that God hath as|signed habitations to men, according to their estate, changing places to them according to the change of their manners. Man in inno|cence had his dwelling in pleasant Paradise: Man after his Aposta|sie was cast out to la|bor the cursed earth whichbears thorns and thistles: Man continu|ing

in Apostasie shall bee sent downe to the place of vtter darkenes, and man receiued a|gaine to mercie, is re|stored to a Paradice, as much more pleasant then that of Adams, as the second Adam is more excellent then the first.
In heauen are none but Elects,If such com|forts be on earth, what may we looke for in heauen. in hell none but abiects: in earth there is a mixture of chaffe andcorne, wheat and popple. Goates and Sheepe, alway if such comforts be heere where good and euill

are together, what deli|cates are there, where there is none but good and if the pasturage heere bee so pleasant, where Goats  Sheep feede together: what pleasures are there where the Sheepe are gathered together by themselues,Cant. and their Pastor lies with them, and rests, feeding them without feare in the noone tyde of the day.
The place of our dwelling admonishes vs that we should be ho|ly and hea|uenly.And as the conside|ration of the place ren|ders vs comfort, so doth it also giue vs this in|struction, that we must

be holy if we desire to dwell there, for no vn|cleane thing can enter into heauenly Ierusale~: we see that in the frame of this world thingsare placed according to their excellency: the earth, as grossest, is set into the lowest roome, boue the earth is the water, as being purer then the earth, aboue the water is the ayre, which is purer then the water, aboue the ayre is the fire,  aboue the fire is the Firmament with the celestiall spheres, which ar purer

then any of them: and aboue them all is the third heauen, wherein our building is situate, excelling in purity all these things which are seene, whereunto wee are admonished, that we who by nature are not onely of the earth, but are also earthly minded, must be trans|changed by grace, and endued with a heauen|ly disposition, before we can be admitted to these new heauens, wherein,2. Pet. as saies Saint Peter, dwels righteous|nesse, and none but

righteous, and renued men can inherit them.
Ver. 2. Therefore we sigh, desiring,The Apostle now comes to shew a three|fold fruit of godlines, which the knowledge of the glory to come workes in the chil|dren of God. c. The Apostle hauing laid downe that solide ground of comfort, which stands to all Christians as a strong preseruatiueagainst the feare of death, comes now to build vpon it, and drawes out of it a three-fold fruit of god|linesse, which hee pro|tests the certain know|ledge of the glory to come, wrought in his heart, and which if wee also can feele wrought

in our owne hearts by the spirit of God, shall serue vnto vs, as wholsom preparatiues to prepare vs in our life,The first is n earnest desire of that glory to come. and makes vs capa|ble of that comfort of all Christians in our death: the first fruite is an earnest desire of that glorie to come: the second, a contentment, with boldnesse to remooue out of the bodie: the third a continuall care, both in life and death to please the Lord.
Heere first wee per|ceiue

the nature of that true and liuely know|ledge, The nature of the liuely knowledge, wrought in vs by the Gospell. which by the Gospell is wrought in the minds of men, not onely doth it let vs see high and excellent things, but also carries our hearts  affections after them: for the Gos|pell is not onely a mir|rour, wherein wee be|hold the glorie of God with open face,It is not only a mirrour whereby we see God, but it is his po|wer, whereby we are carri|ed after him. but also the power of God vnto saluation, by which we are transfor|med into the selfe same Image  similitude:  therefore the Apostle

denies that they haue learned Iesus Christ, who haue not learned to cast off the old man, which is corrupted tho|rough deceiueablelusts and to put on the new, which after God is cre|ated in righteousnesse, and true holinesse And if by this rule the me~ of this generation be try|ed, many shal be found ignorant of Christ, who seeme vnto them|selues to haue learned him well enough.How the two lights of hea|uen shadow two sorts of knowledge in the minde of man.
In the heauens are two lights, wherof the one, to wit, the Moone

hath light without heat or chaunging vertue: the other, to wit the Sunne, doth not onely shine, but sends out such heate and vertue, that by it, things hard are mollified, dead creatures are reuiued, and fading hearbs and trees are made to flou|rish: so is there in the minde of man two sorts of knowledge, the one lets him see the good way, and allures his heart to follow it, the other giues him light, whereby he may discerne things, but al|lures

allures him not to fo|llow the best, it encrea|ses light in the minde, but works not holines in the heart, it doth not conuert, but convince them;The know|lge of ma|ny wokes nothing but their con|uiction. so is it with ma|ny in this age, whose knowledge is better then their conscience, of whom wee may say with the Apostle, it had bin better for them not to haue knowne the way of righteousnesse, nor after that they haue knowne it to turne from the holy commandement giuen vnto them.2 Pet. 2.21.
We sigh.T. godly while they sigh for things that are to come do thereby declare, that they finde no contentment in these which are present. The first ef|fect which the certaine knowledg of the glory to come, wroght in the Apostle, is, as we heard a feruent desire therof, which caused him to breake forth in sighing for it, for the man, who knowes better things, which are to come can not be co~tent with the best of these, which are prese~t, but doth in such sort vse the~, that he de|clares he longs for bet|ter, by sighing and la|me~ting for the long de+lay thereof: as Iob pro|tests, that his sighing

came before his meat, and Dauid mingled his cuppe with teares, so al the godly, who know a better, thinke long till they enioy it, Non satis futura gaudia nosti, nisi reuat consolari anima tua donec veniant: Thou knowes not rightly the ioyes to come, vnlesse thy soule refuse all o|ther comforts, till thou obtaine them.
Desires in the godly goe besore satis|faction.In the children of God, desire goes be|fore satisfaction, but it is certaine what they desire according to Gods word, they shall

obtaine it. It is the fa|culty of them who are in heauen, that they are satisfied with the ful|nesse of ioy, which is in Gods face: it is the feli|city of them, who are militant on earth, to hunger and thirst for righteousnes, with the which they shall be sa|tisfied: they haue ob|teyned in a great part, that which they desi|red; we ar made sure by Gods word to obtaine that which now we de|sire through his grace: for his promise is,Psal. 145.19 The Lorde will fulfill the de|sires

of them who feare him, whether it be righ|teousnes here, or glory hereafter.
Our perfecti|on vpon earth consists rather in de|siring to doe as we should, then in doing it.If then we cannot do as we shold, at least let vs desire to doe so, tota vita boni Christiani Sanctum desiderium est, the whole life of a good Christian is a ho|ly desire,Aug. in Ioan. tract. 4. Rom. 7. yea, the A|postle is not ashamed to protest of him|selfe, that his desires were better then his deede,God accepts our desires for deeds. for hee desired to doe the good wher|unto hee could not at|tain:  such is the fauor

and indulgence of our God toward vs, that our desires hee accepts them for deeds,  ther|fore should wee bee comforted against the conscience of our wa~ts  insufficiency, by the vnfeined desires of bet|ter, which through his grace are in vs: for true desire of grace and glorie is, an vndoubted argument of grace re|ceiued,ut this is to e vnderstood of true desires, which ae discer|ned from vine desires two waies. and glory to be receiued.
But this as I haue said, is to bee vnderstood of true, not of vain desires such as was the desire of

Balaam, who desired that he might die the death of the righteous. Two wayes may the one be discerned from the other:1 True desires are ay the longer, the greater. first these de|sires which are wroght in the soule by the ho|ly spirite, are ay the longer, the more fer|uent, wheras the other is but a false concepti|on, which incontinent dies and euanishes a|way: Secondly, true desire of the glorie to come,2 True desire uses all meanes law|full to bring vs to the thing desired. vses carefully all those meanes, which may bring vs vnto it, such as are the exerci|ses

of the Worde and Prayer, the forsaking of our sinnes, which haue diuided vs from God: for who can think with any reason, that he tru|ly desires to be with the Lord, who neyther de|lights to hear the Lord in his word, nor to speake to the Lord by prayer? and is not care+full to remooue these impediments, which may stay his peace and reconciliation with God.
An example of true desire we haue in Za|cheus,An example thereof in Zacheus. Luk. 19.2 who being desi|rous

to see CHRIST, and finding himselfe impeded by the mul|titude, ranne before, and climed vp vppon a tree, to supply the wants of his lowe sta|ture: and when hee was called vpon by IESVS, hee obeyed the calling, resoluing to parte from his euill gotten goods, that hee might keepe still the Lorde Iesus. So is it with eeri soule which earnestly longs to enioy the Lorde, it runneth by all impedi|ments, vseth all lawfull

meanes, and refuses no required condition; so that they are euen con|tent to denie them|selues, take vp his crosse and follow him.
Wheras the men of this world,The desire which world|lings haue of Christ, is de|scribed. if they haue any desire of Iesus Christ, it is like vnto that which Merchants haue, who hauing tasted wines, like them very well, but refuse to buy them for the greatnesse of the price, so they, hauing tasted of the powers of the life to come haue a de|sire to bee partakers

of them, but when they heare it, cannot be, but vpon this condition, that they denie them|selues  mortifie their earthly lustes, they re|fuse with that young man, who being called by Christ to forsake all  follow him, did first craue license to goe and kisse his father: thus are they deceiued with a vain hope, that a man may ouertake both, that is, embrace the pe|rishing pleasures of sin in this life, and after be partakers of the endu|ring pleasures of the life to come.
Clothed with our house.The  of glory o come is shdowed to vs by sundy simili|tudes. That state of glorie, which before he com|pared to an house, hee now compares to a garment: for it is a cu|stomable thing to Gods spirit, to shadow that glory to come, vn|der sundry similitudes. The Apostle saies it is a glory to be reuealed: Now it is shaddowed, but now it is not reea|led: Whatsoeuer is spo+ken of it, is as much lesse then it selfe,Rom. 8. as a shadowe is lesse then the body: wee see the shadows by which it is

figured, and heare of them, but the glorie it selfe is such, as the eye hath not seene, and the eare hath not heard,No glorious thing, but glory it selfe is promised vnto vs. Bede fall ac psen vitae. it is pondus aeteru~ gloriae, an eternall weight of glory, saith the Apostle Non enim gloriosa vestis aut gloriosa domus, sed gloriaipsa promittitur, si+quid vero illoru~ aut simi|liu~ aliquando dicitur, fi|gura est, it is neither a glorious garment, nor a glorious house hat God promises to vs, but glorie it selfe: and if at any time menti|on bee made of any

such thing as house or garment, it is a figure.
And yet for our in+formation the spirit of God is forced to vse such figures,The spirit of God vses ma|ny similitudes to declare that no simi|litude can ex+presse that glory. as are bor|rowd from most dele|ctable things, and best knowne vnto vs, some way to mak vs co~ceiue that which fully wee cannot vndersta~d, som|time calling it a build|ding, somtime a house, somtime a City, some|time a garme~t,  som|time an inheritance: it is ay one thing which is promised, but many maner of waies exprest

To the Church of Ephe+sus is promised the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God: to the Church of Smyrna is promised immunity from the se|cond death: to the Church of Pergamus is promised hidden Manna, a white stone and a new name, which no man knows, but he who receiues it: to the Church of Thyatira is promised the ruling Scepter and the mor|ning Starre: to the Church of Sardis is promised the writing

of their name in the booke of life: to the Church of Philadel|phia is promised the honor of a Pillar in the Temple of God, and to the Church of Laodi|cea is promised a place with Christ on his Throne. That the spi|rite of God speakes of one thing vnder so ma|ny similitudes, is, to de|clare that the glory of that Kingdome, and ri|ches of that Inheri|tance is greater then that any similitude is able to expresse it.
And hitherto tends

the manner of speech vsed here by the Apo|stle,The godly speake o e glory to come like men transported. it is strangto heare that a man should bee clothed with an house, seeing in common speech men are said to bee clothed with gar|ments, and not with houses, but wee must consider, that no order of wordes can be kept in speaking of that, which passes vnder|standing.
It is said of those three disciples, who saw the glory of Christ on mount Tabor, that being rauished there

with they spake, and knewe not what they said:For no order of words can be kept in speaking of that which passes vnder|standing. Psal. 36.8. so doth the con|templation of the glo|rie to come, transport Gods children, that they beecome, as the Psalmist sayes, Inbria|ti ab vbertate domus dei, so drunken with the pleasures of Gods house, that they forget where they are, they speake not, looke not, doe not after the cu|sme of nature, so long as their mindes are carried after hea|uenly things: and these small beginnings may

witnes vnto vs the ex|cellency of that life, which at length shall change vs wonderfully from that which now we are.
Ver. 3. If so be, wee shall be found clothed,The Apostle expones what he meant by wi|shing to be clothed vpon and not naked. Because in the former verse the Apostle had said, he de|sired to be clothed vp|pon with his house, which is from heauen: that is, hee desired not to lay aside his bodie, but keeping it still, hee wished to be clothed a|boue it with immorta|litie and glory, he sub|ioynes

now a certaine correction of it, I de|sire it, saies he, if so it may stand with the Lords dispensation, that when I shall be re|ceiued into that glory I be [found Clothed] to wit, with my body: which way Henoch and Elijah entred into glo|ry, and all the faithfull, wo shall bee found a hue at Christs second comming, shal also the same way enter into glory: for they shal not lay aside their bodies, but keeping them still as garments and coue|rings

to their soule, shal vpon them be clothed with the garment of immortality and glory, if this way saies the A|postle, I bee found clo|thed and not Naked, that is, if I bee found without a body, which way Adam, Abraham, and the rest of the Fa|thers, Patriarchs, Pro|phets, and Apostles, entred into glory, they were indeede clothed with their house from Heauen, but were not superuested or clothed vpon, which here the Apostle protests he de|sired,

if it might stand with the Lords dispen|sation.
And of this conditi|on which here the A|postle subioynes for correction of his for|mer speach,The Godly in desiring things not ab|solutely pro|mised, sub|mit their will to Gods will. wee may learne how the godly in desiring of thinges not absolutly promised to all Gods children, al|beit giuen to some of them do so temper and moderate their desires, that they submit their will to Gods most ho|ly will: whereor we are admonish'd how much more we ought to mor+tifie

in our selues the vnlawfull desires of things absolutly prohi|bit as being against the will of God. Since the Apostle will not seeke that which God hath granted to ome,Vnlawfull desire of things simply agant Gods will, shuld be sr srom vs. but conditionally, that it may stand with the wil of God may not wee bee ashamed, to seeke that which he hath de|nied and forbidden vn|to al? Oh that we could remember this, as of as our corrupt nature pro+vokes vs to desire those things which God hath forbidden: O man why

wilt thou follow a will contrary to God his most holy wil, or what good can that doe vn|to thee, which thou knowest thou canst not inioy with the fauour of thy God.
Againe wee see that albeit there be one end of all the children of God,All Gods children shall come to one end, suppose not in one ma+ner. for at length they shll all bee gathered from vnder the foure corners of heauen, and et downe with Abra|ham, Isaac, and Iacob, in the kingdome of God, yet doe they not all come to it after one

manner, for some of them as wee haue spo|ken, shall not lay aside their bodies, but kee|ping them still shall be transchanged in a moment, others againe must leaue their bodies behind them till the re|surrection: And this last, suppose our nature abhorre it, wee must learn to be co~tent with it euen to bee broken with the dolors of death, as other Godly mn: yea and our bles|sed Sauiour hath beene before vs, esteeming it comfort sufficient for

vs,Reuel. 14.13 that wee dye in the Lord, and so are sure to rest from our labours, But of this wee haue spoken before.
Ver. 4. For wee that are in this Tabernacle,The Apostle dsires not to want the bo|dy, if it might stand with the Lords dispnsation, sgh and are burdened, be|cause, c. The Apostle here insists in his for|mer purpose, explay|ning more clearely, what it is that hee desi|red: he protests hee li|ued in this body as a malecontent, who knowing a better, and sighing for a better, e|steemed it a burthen to him to be holden backe

from it: And yet least it shold seeme, he were offended at the body, he declares againe that he desired not to sun|der with the body, i it might please the Lord, that keeping still the body, he might bee su|peruested, or clothed vpon with his other most excellent hose, which is from heauen.
Heere first it comes to be enquired,How this plce agrees with Philip.  where hee dsires to bee dssolued and loosed from the body. seeing the Apostle, Phil. 1. affirmes that hee desi|red to be dissolued, and to bee with Christ, and againe cryed out, Rom.

7.6. Miserable man that I a, who will deliuer me rom this body of deah: how is it, that heere he saies he had no will to be vnclothed of the body? The answere is, that these are not contrary, for in the one when he desired to bee loosed from the body, it was not for any ha|tred of the body, but for the loue of Christ, and hatred of sin, wher|of hee knew hee could not be quitt so long as he dwelt in the body: And now when hee protests that he desired

not to want the body, it is not for loue of sin in the body, nor or a|y contentmenth had to be absent fro~ Cist, for afterward conside|ring he could not both abyde in the body, and dwell with the Lord too, hee resolues wil|lingly to remooue out of the body, that hee might dwell with the Lord: So then the de|ire he hath to keepe stil the body is vpon a two folde condition. First that sinne and morta|lity weare not in it, but vtterly swallowed

vp of that life, and next that in the body hee were transported to a|byde and dwell with Iesus Christ.
In holy Scripture wee finde that there thinges hath mooued Gods children to wish a delay of death:Delay of of death is som time de|sird of the Godly for three respects The first is want of prepara|tion in themselues, for the Godly are nor al|way in that estate of life,1. That thy may b btter prepaed to . wherein they dare be bold to dy, and then they desire a proroga|tion of their life,Psal. 39.13. as D|uid did, Stay a little, that I may recover my stre~gth

before I goe hence, and be not. It is a comfortable meditation, which Na|ziansen hath concerning this:Nazian od suum Ani|mum. It is hard (saith he) for me to de|termine, whether I shal desire life or death: on euery hand are extremi|ties. As to life,Nazian|zns doubt whether he should desire life or death. my sins haue already made it bit+ter,  heauie to me, and as to death, alas if once it come, there is no me|dicine after it, left vnto me, by which I may cure my sinnes: wherof it is euident that the de|sire, which this holy man had to liue in the

body, was that hee might mourne for his sinnes, which hee had done in the body, ad|monishing vs by hs ex|ample, that as long as God spares vs, wee shold vs our time wel, not to multiply more offences, which may beed vs terrour in the houre of death, but carefull to purge our consciences of thee, which wee haue con|tracted already.
When Dauid came vpon Saule in his camp and found him slee|ping,A meditati|on how as Daui spared Saul sleping in the campe. he would neither

slay him himself, nor su|ffr Abner to slay him, only he tooke away his speare,So God may  time hath found vs slee|png in our sins and hath not sine vs ut waknd vs. and his water|pot, and these also after that he had wakened him, hee did againe re|store vnto hi, decla|ring thereby that he no manner of way intend|ed his distruction. Bt this is no way compa|rable to these maniold prooffes which God hath giuen vs of his lo|uing kindnesse, for ma|ny a time hath he visi|ted vs in this campe of our warfare, and alas hath found vs sleeping,

when wee should haue been waking, and hath not taken vs away in our sinnes to slay vs but onely hath taken from vs those thinges, wherein we placed ou strength, and mainte|nance of our life, yet so that he hath graciously restored them vnto vs. But alas how many is thre among vs,But our wa|kng hath beene no bt|ter nor Sls, working in v a tmpo|all rpn|ance. who are no other way wak|ned with all this wor|king of God, then Saul was with the working of Dauid, for it wroght in him a temporall re|pentance, and no more:

incontinent hee retur|ned to his old sinnes,  no better is it with ma|ny of vs, or a while af|ter our recouery from sicknes, or deliuerance out of othe troubles we are somewhat reli|gious, but shortly after our repentance vani|shes, like the morning dewe, and wee returne againe to our old man|ners,2 Pet. 2.22 How we should vse the time of life, granted vs on erth is shwd by te example of Dauid am|basadors. as the Sow to the puddle, and the Dogge to his vomit, this is but to abuse the time of Gods patience.
Where it were bet|ter for vs to doe, as did

the Ambassadours of Dauid, who being abu|ed by the King of Am|mon, who cutted their garments to their hips  shaued their beards; at the counsell of Da|uid their King, tarried still in Iericho, the bor|der of their land, till their beards were grown again, and their garments were prepa|red for them: so wee if we follow the counsel of our King and Lord Iesus Christ, should tar|ry heere vppon earth, which to the Godly is the border of heauenly

Canaan for no other end but that the shame which Satan hathdone vs, by deforming our face, in spoiling vs of the image of God, may be taken from vs, and therefore it hould ee farre from vs. to make or shame any more by new sinnes, but ra|ther by grouth in god|lines, to recouer againe our former Image, o|therway if we still abuse the patience of God, we iustly deserue, that tribulation,  anguish of spirt, feareful shame and confusion should

be vpon vs, and if wee preuent it not, we may certainly looke for it, Quo enim diutius expe|ctat Deus,Aug. eo districtius indcabit.
The second reason that hath mooued the godly,2. They desire de+lay of death, that they may doe the greater good in the body. sometime to de|sire a prolongation of their daies, is, that they might doe the greater good in the body, and therefore Dauid consi|dering, that they who are gone to the graue, cannot praise God,Psal. 6. to witpunc; as we doe, who are clad with our bodies on earth, e praies God

to releee him of the heauie sicknesse vnde which he lay. And this same also made the ho+ly Apostle to doubt what he should chuse,Phil. 1. whether to liue in th flesh, or to bee loosed from the body, th one beeing best fo himselfe, the othr bet|ter for the Church o God: And herein als we are admonished to embrace the Apostle, counsell, while ye haue time, be doing good to all men,Gala. 6.10. epecially to them who are of the fa+mily of faith, and our

Sauiours warning,Iohn 11.19. that wee should worke so long as the twelue ho|wers of the day laste. But this conuinces th blockish stupiditie of many, whom God hath suffred to liue, but they do no more praise him, nor if they were dead, and buried.
And the thid mo|tiue,3. Thy desire delay of death for the oue they hae to the body, wich they desire not to want is the loue of the body, Ineffahilis enim est animi ad corpus affe|ctus. And no maruell is it, that the soul be loath to sunder from the owne body, consde|ring that the body was

created in the greate wisedome, and good|nesse of God, to bee a companion to the soul and this reason the A|postle touches heere in the subsequent words, while he saith, because wee would not bee vnclo|thed, for heerein hee de|clares that the cause, why with sighing hee desired to bee clothed with his hose, which is from heauen, was not any mislking hee had of the body, for hee protests now, if it might please the Lord he desired not to want it.
And this desire in it selfe is not euill,This loue of e body is not euill in it selfe. other|way it could not bee in those soules which are glorified in heauen, for euen they long for their bodies, as beeing imperfect without them, for by the first creation s I said, they were made companions, and there|fore the one of them without the other, can|not rest in contentment, the body without the soule, it is as we see, but a dead stocke, or carrion of flesh, whatsoeuer thing is pleasant in the body, be it quicknesse of

sense, agilitie, colour, or beauty, it hath it all of the presence of the soul in it, the soule againe sup|pose glorified in heauen yet rests not in full con|tentment till it bee re|vnitd againe with the body,For uen the glorifi|ed soule rests not in ful content|ment, so long as it wa~ts the bod Ber tract. de diligendo deum. declaring therby, that without it, it can|not be perfited. Consor|tium enim carnis spiri|tus non requireret, si abs|que illa consummaretur, The soule would not desire the fellowship of flesh, if without it, it could be perfited, but God hath so prouided

that souls without their bodies,Ibid. nec velint, nec valeant consummari, nei|ther will nor can be con|summat: And therefore is it that the souls, while they haue their bodies desire not to want them, and while they want them, are not con|tent, till againe they re|ceaue them.
And of al this we are warned,Vhat great need there is to prepare our selues to die with willingnesse what great neede wee haue to pre|pare our selues in time, with willingnesse to re|moue out of the body: for since the Apostle protests, that it was gre|uous

to him to suffer the want of his body, wee may easily thinke, that in regarde of our greater infirmities, it wil be much more greeuous vnto vs, and therefore are wee to endeuour by grace to make our selues willing to die, since by nature we are so vnwil|ling to it: And to this end let vs reuerence the working of our God,For this cause God seasons to his children the plasurs of their life with bitter paines. who seasons the plea|sures of our life with many paines, and giues vs much bitternesse, as Nahomi spake of herselfe to abate the comfort of

our beauty, while as by heauy troubles  cros|ses, hee makes our life vnpleasant, and our bo|dies a burden to our selues. This the Lord doth for no other ende, but that wee may bee made co~tent willingly to quit our bodies for a time, whereas other way, if they continued in their vigour, and health, we wold be loath to want them.
That mortality might be swallowed vp.Yet the A|postle wishes not to kepe the body with the sin and mortality of the body. The A|postle makes cleare in these words, that which he hath spoken before

obscurely, hee wishes so to enter into life, if it might please the Lord, that he went not to it by the way of mortality, but so that mortality might be swallowed vp of that life: hee desires not then, to keepe still the body, and sinne and death in the body, this were to put on a gar|ment of immortality, vpon the rotten ragges of mortall flesh, this were to desire to be glo|rious without, while in the meane time filthy rottennesse, and corrup|tion is within, the Apo|stle

craues no such thing neither indeede can any such thing be, but his de|sire is so to haue his bo|dy preserued, and trans|lated into that life, that sinne in the body,But so that sin and mor+tality might be swallow+ed vp in the body by that life, as at length it shall be. and mortality flowing from sinne were swallowed vp, in such sort that no footestep neither of the one, nor of the other were emaining in the body. And this desire also at the length wil be performed in all the children of God, when his triumphant song shall bee put in their mouthes, O Death where

is thy Sting,1 Cor. 15.55. O' Graue where is thy victory, The Sting of Death is Sinne, the strength of Sinne is the Law: But thankes bee to God who hath giuen vs victory through our Lord Iesus.
The excel|lesy of the life to come, it shall not leau any remanent of sinne or death in the body.Againe wee are to marke here the excellen|cie of that life, whereun|to wee are begotten a|gaine, that it is such a life as shall swallow vp all mortality, and not suffer so much as any antece|dent, or consequent of death to remaine in vs: The Apostle saieth that death hath raigned from

the dayes of Adam, like a tyrant, swallowing vp in the wide mouth  gulfe of mortalitie, al genera|tions, that haue beene sensyne, like the great depth of the Ocean, sup|ping vp in her bosome,Death like a tyrant hath deuou|red al since Adam, but shall be de|uoured by that life. al the riuers of the earth: but there wil be a cha~ge for that life, for which we hope, shal at length swallow vp Mortality,  death in her bosome, all the paines and dolors that goes before it, all the rottennesse and cor|ruption that followes after it:Reuel 21.4 yea not so much as a teare shall be left in

the face of Gods chil|dren, far les shall any re|manents of that poyson wherewith Satan infe|cted our nature bee left in it, the Lord shall so illuminate vs with his light, that no darkenesse shall be left in vs, he shal so reuiue, and quicken vs with his life, that death shall vtterly bee abo|lished, and he shall so re|fresh vs with the ioy of his countenance, that all sorrow shall flye away,This is ex|pressed by the simili|tude of a little water turned in to wine. yea so wonderfull shall the change be, that as a drop of water powred into a great quantity of

Wine, doth lose the v|ry nature of it,r. ser. de diligendo Deo. dum  saporem vini inauit  colorem, and takes on it both the tast and colour of the Wine: so shall all humane cogitation, and affection, cease from that which now it is, the Lord shall so replenish vs, that he shall become all in all vnto vs, he shall make vs pertakers of the diuine nature, and trans|change vs into the simi|litude of his owne I|mage.
And this also should vpholde vs against our naturall feare of death:Comfort a|gainst the feare of death.

Now we goe to life, but through death, and wee leaue behinde vs for a time, a deere pledge in the power of death; for death like vnto a cruell monster bytes from vs in the by-passing, the halfe of vs, to wit, the bo+die, wherefore Mors a mor su nomen accepit, aid Augustine, because one part it bytes away, and another it leaues behind it, but at length, when the day of our full victo|ry shall come, and the course of the battell changed, not a part of death onely shall be de|uoured,

but altogether it shall be swallowed vp in victory.


VER. 5.
And hee who hath crea|ted vs, c.

_LEast it should seeme,He prooues that this de|sire which he had, was no  vain desire by two reasons. that the Apostle, in that which he hath saide be|fore, were carried away with a vain desire of that which shall neuer come to passe, hee doth now prooue by two argu|ments that it is no vaine desire but such as at the length shall bee fulfiled

both in him  all the rest of the children of God.
1. First be|cause by Gods ordi|nance we are appoin|ted to tat immortall lie, both in the first and second cre|ation.The first argument is taken from Gods or|dinance and appoint|ment, the Lord saith he, hath appointed vs to immortality and life,  therefore of necessity we must obtaine it, for it is not possible that the Lord can be frustrate or diapointed of his end. If we looke to the first creation, wee were crea|ted to the Image of God and consequently to be immortal, for immorta|lity is a part of the image of God, and if we looke

to the second creation, this same shall bee more manifest, for this cause did Christ die for vs, that we might liue e|ternally with him, and certainely his death was in vain, if that life which he hath conquest vnto vs, did not at the length ouercome all mortality and death in vs.
But there is yet grea|ter comfort in this ar|gument,Neither hath God only appoin|ted vs to that end, bu also by his owne working in vs perfils vs to it. as it is propo|sed by the Apostle, for hee shewes vs, that not onely are wee by Gods ordinance appointed to this end, but that the

Lord also by his effectu|all working in vs, ad|uaunces vs to the same ende, for so the worde  which heere the Apostle vses imports a present action of our God, perfiting in vs our saluation against all impediments, In the first creation, when once he began, he continued working ay, and while he finished it, and no in|tervening impediment could stay him from the perfiting of his pur|pose:He finished the first creatio~ against al impedi|ments, so shall he doe the second. it pleased him in six daies to absolue it, in euery one whereof

hee made something to bee, which was not be|fore, but til he had done all which he would, he rested not, so is it in the worke of our new crea|tion, he hath begunne it and we may be sure hee wil make an end; In one day he might, if hee had willed, perfetly haue re|generate vs, but pleases him in many daies, and by degrees to doe it, al|way we are sure that nei|ther Satans malice, nor corruption of our Na|ture, can stay him from finishing that which he hath begunne, The same

God who first comman|dd light to shine out of darkenesse, is hee who hath shined in our harts to giue vs the light of the glory of God,2. Cor. 4.6. in the face of Iesus Christ, and he first made vs of dust, giuing life and beauty to that which was dead  without forme, hath taken in hand through death  misery to per|fit vs to eternall life.
Comforta|ble i it to vs that the certainty of our life stands in Gods pur|pose which cannot be altered.The certainty then of our glorification stands neither in vs nor in our desires, but in the stability of the purpose of the vnchangeable

God, of the which it is not possible that hee should be disappointed, as to man many a time he proposes to himselfe an ende of his actions, whereof he is frustrate, hee builds a house and dwels not in it, he plants a Vineyard, and etes not the fruit thereof, he betrothes a wife and a|nother marries her,Esa. 46.10. but the counsel of the Lord shall stand, The Lord of hoasts hath determined it, and shall disanull it, his hand is stretched out and who shall turne it away? wil Satan, wil sin,

will death keepe vs from that glory, whereunto God hath appointed vs? No, no, it is not possible: what the Lord hath said, he will doe, blessed bee the holy name of the Lord for euer, who hath locked vp our saluation, and made it sure in his own vnchangeable pur|pose.
This shoul vphold vs against Stans temp|tations.It is true indeede that Satan is a restlesse temp|ter of all the children of God, he doth what hee can to impede the work of our saluation, but let vs bee comforted, hee fights not against vs, but

against the Lord, let vs therfore in the strength of our God fight against him, and we shal be sure to ouercome him, onely remember that as in some temptations hee is to bee resisted, as when he tempts vs to sinne, ei|ther by presumption, or desperation, so in other temptations he is to bee despited,VVhat a shamelesse tempter Sa|tan is. and reiected, as when hee dare suggest that vnto others, the contrary wherof he be|leeues himselfe, as namely that there is not a God, nor a iudgement to come, in others a|gaine,

hee is to bee sor|ned, as not worthy of an answere, as when hee charges Gods children with those things, which they neuer did, as he can craftily abuse their phan|tasie to troble the peace of their minde: for hee that will answere euery shamelesse assertion of Satan, shall not haue leaue to doe any other thing.
Satan was the enemy of gods glo|ry, ere euer hee became the enemy of or salua+tion. But in all these, as I said, let vs hold fast our former ground of com|fort; that we feare not for him, that is against vs, but stand sure, consi|dering

that the Lord is with vs, he that is the e|nemy of our peace, is al|so an enemy of the glo|ry of God, yea which is very comfortable, hee was an enemy to God first, ere euer he became an enemy to vs, and it is onely for the hatred hee hath to the Lord our God, that hee hates vs, seeking to deface the glory of God, which shi|ned clearely in the first creatio~, but more clear|ly in the second creatio~ of man, but all in vaine, for the Lord shall con|found him,Rom 16. and trample

him shortly vnder the feete of his Saints.
But w are not to re|gard him, seeing God hath taken in hand to worke the worke of our saluation.And hereunto also tends it, that the Apo|stle as hee saide before, that God is the builder of our house which wee haue in heauen, so now he saith that God creats and perfits vs vnto it, these two ioyned toge|ther, 'render vs most sure comfort, that the Lord hath not only prepared a Kingdome for vs, but also prepares vs for it: he reserues in heauen, saith Saint Peter,1. Pet. 1. an inheri|tance for vs,  reserues vs also in earth for it,

thus all is of him, both the place of our glory, and the grace, by which we come to it, that the praise of all may returne vnto himselfe alone.
Who hath also giuen vs the earnest of the Spirit.2.He proues it by th ear|nest of the spirit which God hath giuen vs vp  his word. The second argument by which the Apostle prooues, that the desire of immortality in the godly is no vaine desire, is here, that God hat not onely in his word promised to giue it, but hath also therevpon ge|uen vs the earnest of his Spirit, and there|fore of necessitie it

must be performed, for God is not as man, that he shouldlye or repent, the Lord is faithfull, and will doe as he speakes.
VVithout this earnest of the spirit we can haue no surety of our saluati|on.This is the greates argument of comfort that we haue in this life to susteine vs: It is in|deed much, that we haue the word, the promises, and the Oath of God, sounded in our eares, and that we haue the sa|craments, as the seales of God presented to our eares, but none of these can make vs sure of a better life after this, vn|lesse with them we haue

receiued the earnest of the spirit into our harts:
By the workes and word of God wee may know that vniuersall co|uenant,There is a couenant of God which man know|eth by his workes, ano|ther by his word only, the third by his word  Spirit. which God hath made with all mankind, hat he wll not drown the worl againe with waters, for as God in his word hath promised it, so hath hee also set his rainebow in the firma|ment for a witnesse to confime it: By the word and Sacraments, all that are in the visible Church may know that speciall cauenant, which God hath made with his a|dopted

children, but that this same couenant of grace is particularly bound vp with thee, thou canst not know ex+cept with the Sacra|ments, thou hast also re|ceiued the spirt.
Foure things to be considered in this ar|gument. Now to make this comfort the more sensi|ble vnto vs, we are here to consider these foure things: first, what is meant here by this Spi|rit, Secondly why is it called an earnest, Third|ly how is it receiued, Fourthly wherby may we know, whether wee haue receiued it or not.
By the Spirit here we vnderstand that speciall grace of the holy Spi|rit,1. hat is meant by the Spirit, to wit, that special grace of the Spirit, by which Gods child|ren are re+nued and confirmed. by which the Lord renews, strengthens, sta|blishes, and confirmes his own children, which for the purging vertue that is in it, to make cleane them who re|ceiue it, is compared to fire and water, and for the corroboratins, and strengthening vertue that it hath, is compared to holy oyntment  for the vertue it hath to sta|blish and confirme our hearts against all doub+ting, is caled, the earnest the Seale, and the 
How this grace of  spirit is cal|led the ear|nest of the spirit, for two causes.And this grace of the spirit, is called the earnest of the spirit, first for the measure, next for the nature and vse therof: for now we haue it in a small measure in comparison of that, which we shall receiue hereafter: And wee are to obserue it against the customable policie of Satan, who casts vp to Gods children the smalnes of their faith, loue, and other graces of the spirit, of purpose to driue them to dis|paire, as if they had no grace at all, because it is

but small and little,The first is ecause hat now we haue it but in small measure. which they haue, but we are to remember against him, that the best mea|sure of grace we haue in this life, is compared to an earnest pennie: wee will not therefore faint because now wee haue not the fulnesse, but rather will be com|forted, knowing assured|ly that the Lord, who now hath giuen vs the earnest, will afterward giue vs the principall, for the Kingdome of God in vs proceedes to perfection, from smal beginnings, and there|fore

is the groth there|of co~pared by our Lord to the grouth of a little grain of mustard seede, which in the beginning is small, but by time in|creases to an high tree.
Yt the smal begin|ing of grace we haue, is not small in Sata~ his eis yea more then he is able to quench.And truly that same lit|tle beginning of grace which god hath wroght in vs, howsoeuer Sata~ ex+tenuates it,  labours to make it seeme little in our eies, yet is it not smal in our owne eyes, but much more the~ he wold with to be in vs,  ther|fore doth hee what hee can vtterly to quench it, but in vaine  this same

seed of grace in vs how little soeuer, yet is it bles|sed of God,  shal grow and increase to cast Sa|can vtterly out of that Kingdome, which once he possessed in vs, for if the beginnings of grace inable vs to resist Satan, shall not the perfection thereof much more ina|ble vs to ouecome him.
Now the nature and vse of the earnest is,The next is in egard of the vse thereof, which is to bind  oth the giuer and recei|uer. as we know, to binde both the giuer and receiuer, the giuer is bound by it to stand to his word and promise, whats'euer that he hath made, the recei|uer

againe is bound to sta~d to the conditio~, whervp+on he receiued it:  here we are admonished that if on Gods part, wee would haue his earnest valid to binde him to stand to his promises, wee must on our part declare, that they are forcible to binde vs to stand to our promised dueties: But alas in this generation, men liue as if the Lord were onely bound to bee mercifull to them, and they were not bound to be ser|uiceable to him, but it were free to them to

liue as pleases them. The Lord giue vs wise  vnderstanding hearts, and sanctified memories to remember it, as oft as our enemies would so|licite vs to transgresse the commaundements of our God, that by the bond of creation, by the right of redemption, by our oath in baptisme, by receiuing the earnest of God in our regenerati|on, beside innumerable other obligations, wee are bound seruants to the Lord our God, with a solemne renuntiation of the Deuill, the world

and the flesh.
3. How this Spirit is gi|uen and re|ceived. The giuer is God by the meanes of his word.As to the third, the giuing and receiuing of this Spirit: it is certaine that the giuing is euery where ascrybed to God, as Eph. 1.13.2. Cor. for the ministry of grace, God hath reserued it to him|selfe: the Ministry of the word, by which hee gi|ueth grace, he hath con|credited to men. Moses gaue the law, but grace comes by Christ, Iohn baptises with water, Ie|sus baptises with the ho|ly Ghost, Paul may plant and Apollo water but God must giue the

increase. Yet is it much that it pleses god to giue his grace by the ministe|ry of the word, and ther|fore if we loue the one, we must not mislike the other: That same holy spirit who commanded Philip to ioyne himselfe to the Eunuches Chari|o,Act. 8.27. to teach him, might by himselfe haue taught the Eunuch, but he would do it by the min|stery of a man. And the Lord might haue caused th' Angel who~ he sent to Cornelius to haue taught him,Act. 10.1. but he would do it by the ministry of Peter

and notable is it, that while Peter is preaching the holy Ghost descen|ded vpon Cornelius and his friends. Thus we see how God, who giues the grace, giues it by the ministrie of the word.
VVe must not despise the word, if we desire to reeiue the spirit. Rom. 10.13.14.God hath linked in one chain all the meanes of saluation, and man should not presse to sun|der them, they who call on the name of the Lord, shall be saued, but how shall they call on him, on whom they be|leeue not, how shal they beleeue but by hearing? how shal they heare but

by preaching? and how shall men preach ex|cept they bee sent. I will not so be content with preaching, that I neg|lect prayer, because the ministrie is of men, but the grace is from God; neither will I so depend on prayer, that I despise preaching, for hee can neuer receaue grace fro~ God, who despises the means, by which it plea|ses God to giue it.
Now as to the fourth whereof wee promised to speake,4. How may we know we haue recei|ued this spi|rit. it is a point most necessary to bee knowne for our com|fort,

how we may know whether if or not wee haue receiued this spirit, there are many in this age who haue heard the Testimony of God in his Gospell, who as yet haue not receiued the seale and Testimony, A very lamentable thing indeed, for albeit the Gospell be a doctrine of ioyful tydings, yet what comfort can it bring to the~,Many in this age haue heard the Testi|mony of God, who neur recei|ued the seal therof. who are not assured they belong vnto the~.
The Apostle writing to the Corinthians tha~ks God not onely for that they had hard the word

but because the testimo+ny of God, was confir|med vnto the~,  suchlke to the  phefia~s,1 Cor. 6. Eph. 1.13. he tha~ks God not onely for that they heard the word of truth, which is the Gos+pel of saluation, but lso for that after they had be+leeued, they were sealed with the holy spirit of promise: but truly as the disciples at Ephesus being asked if they had receiued the holy Ghost answered we know not if there be such a thing,Act. 19.2. as an holy Ghost, so is it with many in this age who haue heard the gos|pel which is the

testimonie of Gods loue, if they bee asked whether if or not they haue receaued the ear|nest of the Spirit, which is the seale, and confirma|tion of the testimo|nie, shall bee found not to knowe what the ear|nest of the Spirit is.
But now to shew in one worde how it may be knowne,The spirit is God his seale, and he imprints the image of God in all who receiues him. wheher if or not wee haue recea|ued him, let vs remem|ber that the same holy Spirit, which is heere called the earnest of God, is also called the seale of God. Now the

nature and vse of a seale, is that it leaues behinde it, in that which is stamped by it, and impression of that same forme, which it hath in it selfe. Euen so also the Spirit of God imprints the very image of God in the hearts of so many, as are sealed by him, in which sense the Apostle sayes,Rom. 6.17 that the Romanes were deliue|red vnto a forme of do|ctrine, whereunto from the heart they had been obedient, thereby de|claring, that euen as wax is made conforme to the print of the seale,

vnto which it is deiue|red so the hearts of the Godly are made con|forme to the Image of God,This proues that licen|tious men haue not re|ceiud Christs spi|rit. so soone as they are stamped with his ho|ly spirit: So that they who liue liceniously af|ter the lusts of the flesh, declare themselues to be of their father the de|uill, because as our Sa|uiour said to the carnall Iewes, they doe his workes, and it is but a ly|ing presumption, when the like to these men dare say, that they haue receiued the earnest of the spirit.




VER 6.
Therefore we are bold.

_FOllowes now the 2. conclu|sio~,The second fruit of god|lines, which the Aopstle gathered of his Gene|rall ground of Comfort, is which the certain know|ledge of that glory to come, wrought in the Apostle, to wite a con|tentment with boldnes to remooue out of the body, that hee might dwel with the Lord: and this hath in it more ten is in the former, for where in the 1. he prote|sted only he had a desire to that glory, yet so that he had no wil to want

the body:A willing contentm to remoo out of the body. but now hee goes further, conside|ring that hee was not a|ble to enioy them both together, he protests he was gladly conte~t to re|moue out of the body, that hee might dwell with the Lorde. This meaning of the wordes shall bee cleare, if after the sixt verse wee reade the eight, passing by the parenthesis, which is in the seuenth verse.
Of our Christian confidence in death. The word the Apo|stle vses heere, signifies such a boldnes as stout-hearted men vse to set against great daungers,

for where there is no cause of feare, where can the praise of bold|nesse be: there is then (will the Apostle say) matter of great feare in death: I see before mee a terrible deepe and gulfe of mortality, through which I must goe, many fearefull enemies with whom I must fight before I wonne to my Lord,VVhat strong ene|mies wee must fight withall that through death we may wonne to our Lord yet am I not af|fraid to encounter with them.
Against me is Satan with his principalities powers, and spirituall wickednesse, but I know

that the seede of the wo|man hath brused the head of the Serpent: A|gainst mee are a greate multitude of my sinnes nd the terrors of a gilty conscience, but I know that Christ hath once suffered for sinnes,1. Pet 3  8 the iust for the vniust, that ee might bring vs to God, so that now there is no condemnation to tem which are in him. Against me stands in my way dreadfull death, with the horrors of the graue, but I know my Lord hath taken away the sting of death and

spoiled the graue of victorie: Shall I then bee afraide? No certainely, but through the vally of death will I walke with boldns, ill I come to the Lord my God.
And this boldnesse against death in the godly,Boldnesse of the Chri|stian in death, wher|from pro|ceedes it. proceedes not onely from the sure knowledg of a better life, but from the pre|sent sense, and feeling of the same life begunne in them, which they know cannot be extinguished by death: Notable ex|amples haue we therof in all ages, to proue that

it is no vaine content, but the effectuall power of God working in his children.
The confi|dent old|nesse of Ig|natius in death.Ignatius Bishop of Antioch, beig brought to Rome in the third persecution which was vnder Traian, gaue a proofe of his boldnesse for being condemned to be cast to the beasts to bee deuoured by them,en. lib. 5. cont. va|lent. hee gaue this an|swere, nihil visibilium: nihil inuisibilium moror, modo Christum acquiram, I stand sayes hee, vpon nothing visible, nothing inuisible, so that I may

finde and obtaine the Lord Iesus, let fire come let the crosse, let beasts, let the breaking of my bones, the convulsion of my members, the grinding of my body, yea let all the torments of Satan come vpon me, I care not for them so that I may inioy the Lord Iesus.
And Policarpe who suffered in the fourth persecution vnder Aure|lius Antoninus,Euseb. lib. 4. ca 16. The confi|dent bold|nesse of Policarpus in death. beeing brought to the place of execution, and desired by the Emperours De|puty to blaspheme

Christ, and he would let him goe, answered: these fourescore and sixe yeares, haue I serued Christ, and haue found him a good Master to mee, how then can I curse my king who hath saued me: But if ye will not (saide the deputy) I will cast thee to wilde Beasts, who shall teare thee, Call them when thou wilt (said the Mar|tyr) it is fixed and deter|minat with mee, that from good thinges by repentance, I will neuer goe back vnto worse, But if ye feare not beasts

(said the Deputy) I shall bridle and danton you with fire: thou boasts me said the Martyr with a fire, that burnes for an houre, and shortly after will be extinguished, but knowes not that fire of the iudgement to come, which will burne for euer and euer, and then being brought to the fire, hee was filled with boldnesse, and har|ty thankes giuing reioy|cing that the Lord in that day and houre had vouchafed to receiue him, in the number of his Martyrs, to drinke

of the cup of his Lord Iesus Christ: Thus was he offered in a burnt of|fering to the Lord, and no feare of death could be perceiued in him.
The confi|dent bold|nesse of Ba|silius in death. Nazian. de vita Basil. And the like Christi|an boldnesse was shew|ed by Basil in that per|secution vnder Valens made by Modestus and Eusebius his Deputies: I will neuer (sayd hee) feare death, which can dono more but restore me to him that made me: all these beside ma|ny other innumerable examples which might be alledged, if they bee

co~pared with that great timiditie  feare, which is in vs at the least men|tion or appearance of death, may iustly make vs ashamed of that smal progresse, which wee haue made in spirituall strength, Now in this time of so cleare a light, and plentifull grace of our Lord Iesus Christ.
Alway.It is de|manded if such bold|nesse be in Gods chil|dren as is wthout all feare. But here least the Godly de discoura|ged, by reason of that feare of death, which many a time they finde in themselues, it is to be considered, if the Apo|stle was alway so bolde

that at no time hee was fearfull, or if such confi|dence can bee in any of Gods children,It is answe|red, foreen our Sauiour though hee longd for death yet he suffered it not without feare. as is without all vicissitude of feare, No surely for the same Apostle who here reioices in his bold|nesse proests in an o|ther place, that hee had fightings without, and terrors within: Yea our blessed Sauiour, albeit he longed with a greate desire to eate the passo|uer, which was his last meale, and after which immediately hee knew his passion was to fo|low, yet when he entred

into the garden to his sufferings, hee began al|so to be affraid,  procee|ding in feare hee sweat blood and confessed that his soule was heauy vn|to the death.Mar 14.33 It is true there is no Comparison betweene his death and ours. It is true there is no comparison betweene his death and ours, for he suffered that death to be a satisfacti|on for our sinnes, and he alone trod the wine|presse of the wrath of God: but our death, neither is it a satisfacti|on for sinne, neither a stroke of the wrath of God, neither endure we it by our owne strength

but are sustained in it by the spirit of our Lord, yet is it in such fort made comfortable to vs, that in some manner it is conformeable to his death,Yet must our death someway be conforma|ble to his, both in out|ward and inward sufferings. Rom. 8. for so saith the A|postle, that God hath predestinate vs to bee conforme to the image of his son, and that not in heauen only, by ray|ning with him in glory, but in earth also by car|rying his image, and bea|ring of his Crosse, both in our life and death and that not onely by suffe|ring the outward do|lors of death, caused by

the seperation of the soule and body, but also the inward feares  ter+rors thereof, that so in our little measure ta|sting of that cup, wher|of our Sauiour dranke before vs, wee might some way learne the great loue he hath cari|ed towards vs.
So that wee are not exempted fro~ our owne feares,And ther|fore shall we be exer|cised with our owne feares also. wherewith in death after our small measure, God wil haue vs exercised: which I haue marked, that wee should not be discoura|ged with this tentation

of the feare of death, we may tast of it, but it shall not remayne with vs, for it is certaine, that in all Gods children faith shall preuaile at length. and confidence in Gods promises shall breed such bodnes, as shall cast out and ouercome all con|trarie feare in vs.
VVhat made the Apostle wil|ling to re|moue out of the bodyKnowing that while we are at home in, c. In the end of this verse the A+postle casts in two rea|sons which wrought in him, this co~fidence and willingnes to goe out of the body, one is that so lo~g as he was in the bo|dy,

he was absent fro~ the Lord, another that re|mouing out of the bo|dy, he knew hee should dwel with the Lord, the Apostle to expresse this, vsetwo words, in the o|riginal  which ca~not be turned in to full significant speeches in our languag, yet do they import thus much, that so long as we are here among our owne people in the bo|dy, we are absent from our people who are with the Lord.
So that hee wil here draw vs to consider of

two Cities,Of the two Cities or Fellowshi of people whereof the one is in the earth the other in heauen. two Coun|tries, and two fellow|ships of people, where|of the one is in the earth, the other in hea|uen, with the one wee haue fellowship so long as wee are in the body, and by expeience knowe, what are the comforts of our carnall kinred, of our earthly country  city, but with the other wee cannot haue familiar conuersa|tion, till we remoue out of the body: And this also serues greatly, if we consider it, to take from vs our natural vnwiling|nesse

to de, the cause whereof is, that we haue no will to depart from our country, kinred and people:Death is but a rmo|ving from a Burges-ship on earth to a better Bur|ges-ship in heauen. but here we are taught that if it greiue vs to depart from this people, it should much more reioyce vs to bee gathered to that people, there is a better Coun|try, there a more glori|ous Citie,  a more ex|cellent Burgeship, there is that  whereof th'Apostle, by which we are made free to greater liberties, and priuiledges then any we can haue here,  there is a kinred

of people sibber to vs,  much worthier to be loued then that which is heere, as the heauens are more high and excel|lent then the earth. Oh that this light did a way shine in our minds, that as oft as wee are trou|bled with the griefe o Nature to forsake our people, which are on earth, we might be com|forted by grace, and made willing to goe to our people which are in heauen.
Our life on earth is a Pilgrimage in heauen is our hme. For he Apostle co~|paring these two toge|ther: he accounts our

abyding here but a Pil|grimage in respect of our remaining there, which is dwelling at home in our own coun|try, our best estate wher|in we can be vpon earth is but an absence from the Lord: of all places in the world, a man natu|rally loues his natiue countrey best, and of all parts of his countrey, hee esteemes, himselfe most homely in his own house, and of all that is in his house, what hath he neerer to him then his owne body, yet is it of truth, that not onely

in his owne Country, but euen in his house, at his owne fire, in his own bed, yea euen in his owne body he is but a stranger, and therefore so should wee liue in it, as ready to remoue out of it, for here we haue no continuing Citie.
If there were no more to make us loath this life, this is sufficient that it holds vs from God.We are absent from the Lord. The losse that we sustaine by our soiour|ning in the body, the A|postle takes it vp in few words, but very weigh|ty, to wit, that it keepes vs absent fro~ the Lord: and truely, if there were no more to sparre vs

from the loue of this life, yet this were e|nough that it holdes vs from the Lord our God, whom aboue all, wee ought to loue most deerely,Nazian|zen. de ca|la. animae suae How the bodie is Re|mora Ani|mae. for this cause Nazianzen writing of the calamities of his soule, and of the hinde|rances; which it hath by the body, compares the body to that fih called Remora, which retaynes the greatest Ship, not|withstanding she be vn|der saile, and makes her stand still: so is it with the body, that it presses downe the soule, and

holdes it backe from the Lord, yea though her affection be intended to be with the Lord, for no man can liue in the bo|dy and see the Lord,Exod. 33. and therefore like men op|pressed, captiued and vi|olently kept backe from our God, with whom faine wee would bee, should we liue in the bo+dy, lamenting and mour+ning with the Apostle, O miserable men that we are,Rom. 7. who shal deliuer vs from the body of death.
Againe if this be the condition of the Godly

that notwithstanding by faith they haue a most sweete fellowship with God,If euen the godlie in the dy be  from God, in what mise|rabe ab|sence ae the wicked. as ye shall af|terwards here, yet while they are in the body, they are absent from God, in what miserable condition I pray you are the wicked, who be|ing without faith, are in a more fearefull maner strangers from the life of God,Ephe. 4. Act. 17. through the ig|norance of God that is in them, for if euen they who beleeue, while they are in the body, are ab|sent from the Lord, what shal we say, if the


the Lord in this life, and will not know his way vpon earth to walke in it, shall against their will in the life to come, be banished from him and cast into the vtter borders of darkenesse, from his ioyfull face, from which most vnhap+py condition the Lord deliuer vs: But as to our absence from od, it shal shortly be recom|penced with the most comfortable fruition of his presence, if so bee in the time of our absence, wee so liueas euer pre|sent beforehim studying

to doe his holy will that so we my bee accepta|ble to him.



VER 7.
For we walke by faith, c.

_BEcause he said before,VVe haue now God present with vs, but that presence is absence in respect of that which is to come. that in the body wee are absent fro~ the Lord, and it might haue beene obiected to him, how can this bee, seeing not onely with the rest of mankinde wee liue, and mooue, and haue our beeing in him, but that this also, is the par|ticular

priuiledge of a Christian, that he is the Temple and habitation of God, wherein hee dwells by his holy spi|rit, how then can we be said to bee absent from him. This doubt here in this Parenthesis hee loseth, by distinguish|ing that presence of God which they inioy, which are in heauen, from that which wee haue who are on earth, shewing that the most familiarpresence of god, which wee haue on earth, if it be compared with that which we shal

haue in heauen, is but absence from God, for we that are in the body, walke by faith, where they that are out of the body enioye him by sight, So that in this verse we hauea briefe dis+cription, both of our life who are militant here on earth, and of theirs who are glorified and triumphant in heauen: we are walking, they are resting, wee be|leeue, we looke for the promised kingdome, but they doe presently inioy it.
Heere then wee haue

three things to consi|der,Our lfe on earth is a walking. first how our life is  walking, secondly a walking by faith, thirdly how it is not by sight. As to the first our best estate in this life is wal|king, Seeing we are not yet at home to enioy the sight of our fathers face, our next best is to be walking homeward, they are blessed who are in Patria, and in the se|cond roome blessed al|so who are in via ad pa|riam.Take heede we be in the right way otherway our life is not a wal|king but a andring.
And here we are ad|monished to looke to the ourse of our life,

that we be surewe are in the right way, otherway our life is not a walkin by faith but a wandring in infidelity,Iohn 14.6. the way is Christ, I am the way, the verity and the life: a won|derfull secret, quod ipse rex patriae fctus est via ad patriam, that the king of the Country, is be|come the way to the Country: therfore since he is life, we must walke to him, since hee is the way, and the verity, wee must walke in him, and be in him,  then do we walke in him, when we beleeue in him,  keep

his commaundement declyning euill, follow|ing good vsing thinges indifferent to the gory of God, and edification of our neighbour, if in any of these three wee faile, we are to know 'it is a step out of the way vnto the which againe wee haue to returne by repentance.
How our life is a walking by faith.By faith. The second thing here is that wee walke by faith, and this wee are said to doe first, because faith by the light of the word lets vs see the way to Gods face, secondly because

it allures our hearts, and makes them willing to enter into it, thirdly it confirmes vs against all wearinesse that may a|rise of the longsomnesse of our iourney, though we cannot come to the end thereof, as soone as we would, faith makes vs through patience to waie for it; As likewise it sstaines vs against all impediments and offen|ces that are in the way, for it is as a staffe in the hand of a Pilgrime, which so soone as our iourney is ended, wee shall lay from vs, or

faith shall cease, when we shal take vp the Lord by sight.
And not by sight, which is not simply spoken but in compari|son.Not by sight. The third thing in this dis|cription of ou life here on earth, is that wee walke not by sight, that is, not by such sight as they haue, who haue en|ded their walking, and rest in the Lord, other way we are nt to think that faith by which wee walke, leades vs blind+lings and without light,For heere w re not witout the sight of God or that in this earth, wee haue no sight of God.
For first heere hee is seene in his workes: the

invisible things of God,Rom. 1. that is his eternall pow|er and Godhead,1. First we see God in his workes. are seene by the creation of the world forthis nume|rosity of so many kindes of creatures, and the va|riety of their formes what els it, but as the Plato niques called e|uery beautifull created thing Splendor summi il|lius boni, or as Bernar calls them,Ber. in Cant Ser. 31. Radij Diuini|tatis, monstrantes quod vere sit, a quo sunt, quid autem sit, non plane defi|nientes.
Secondly it pleased God by sundry appariti|ons

to shew himselfe to men from the begin|ning,2. The Fa|thers haue seene him y sundry Visions. appearing vnto them, Non sicuti est sed si|cut dignatus t, for if they had seene him as he is, then al of them had seene him after one manner, because hee is one, and this sight of God, was also externall being exhibited Per ima|gines forinsecus apparen|tes,Ibid. seu voces sonantes.
3. In his Church he is seene by his word.Thirdly it hath plea|sed him in more com|fortable manner, to re|ueale himselfe to his Saints by his word, by which they behold his

beauty in his temple,Psal. 27.4 1. Cor. 3.18 and with open face see his image as it is repre|sented to them, in the myrror of the Gospell, and are transformed in|to the same.
And last of all hee is seene of his owne chil|dren by inward contem|plation,His Saints see him by inward Co~tempation. quum per seip|sum dignatur invisere animam quaerentem se, when by himselfe with|out externall meanes he vouchsafes to visite the soule that seekes him, and this sight is Eo excel|lentior quo interior, the more excellent then the

rst because it is more in|ward, for then is he seen in his fauour and beau|ty, then is he felt in the sweetnesse of his loue, then is the mind so illu|minate with his light, that all other beauty in the world, seemes but deformity in respect of it, and the heart is so en|amored with his loue, that these things, which were most dearely belo|ued of it before, be|come now loathsome like dung vnto it.
Yet Certaine it is, that the most excellent fight of God wee haue

in this life,Yet this sight if it be ompared th the ight we shal get, is no sight. Aug. de Consen E+vang. if it bee compared with that which is to come, is not worthy the name of sight homini enim mortalem vitam adhuc agenti, non protest contin|gere, vt dimoto ac discusso omni nubilo phantasiaru~ corporalium, seremissim incommutabilis veritatis luce potiatur, it cannot said Augustine befall to a man liuing in the bo|dy, to enioy that most cleare light of vnchange|able truth, in such sort, that al cloudes of earth+ly phantasies and carnall conceptions be chased

away and remooued from him, and hither tends the like saying of Gregory,Gregory. Rerum similitu|dinibus speclando non inuolui angelicae puritatis est, in contemplation to haue our mind free from earthly shadowes in si|militudes, belongs to the purity of Angels, but not to man vpon earth.
And the sight of faith which presently we haue lets vs see a better to come. Neuertheles not on|ly doth faith presently open the eyes of our vnderstanding to be|holde in some sort the riches of that glorious inheritance, but in like

manner prepares them for that greater sight thereof, which is to bee reuealed vnto vs, fides enim luce non extingu|it, sed custoit, lucem tem|perat oculo caliganti:  oculum praeparat luci, for faith doth not extin|guish light, but pre|serues it, it tempers the light to our diuine eye, and lets vs looke to it through a vaile onely, least ouer great a glance of light should strike vs blinde,And pre|pares also the eye of our mind for it. and againe pre|pares the eye for that light, which more cleer|ly after is to bee reueled

vnto vs.Ber. in Cant. Serm 31. Quod videt An|gelus hoc mihi seruat vm|bra fidei, fidei sinu reposi|tum, tempore suo reuelan|dum, That which the Angel presently sees in heauen, is keeped for me wound vp in the sha|dow of faith to bee re|uealed in the dew time
The order appinted by God, is that by faith we walke to sight, by earing to seeing.Alwayes for our in|struction, we must learn here to keepe the order appointed by God, that from faith wee walke to light, we must heare the Lord before we can see him, wee must beleeue before we enioy him, if wee will not heare him,

and by hearing beleeue in him, and beleeuing in him, walke toward him, wee shall neuer see him in mercy, nor come where he s to rest with him.
And againe,A corrobo|ratiue a|gainst such temptations as come from the world. this sen|tence being laide vp in our hearts, will serue to strengthen vs against the manifold temptati|ons of Satan, by which he wold allure vs to the loue of worldly things Our life here on earth is a walking by Faith, and Faith is of things which are not seene, and there|fore shold we not suffer

our selues to bee snared and entangled with the lou of any thing, which fals vnder the eye, nor diuerted by any thing, that is present, from the loue and constant ex|pectation of better thinges which are to come.
Seeing wee walk by fah, no shew of worldly plea+sre faling vnder ou sight should allre vs.But as oft as the world comes in to make a shew of her pleasures to vs as Satan presented to our Sauiour a shewe of the kingdomes of the earth, let vs remember this for an answere, We walke not by sight, but by faith, Let them bee de|lighted

with such things s falles vnder naturall ense, who haue no hope of better. Mine heart is aboue all these things which fall vnder the eye,VVhat e|uer the world can offer to our sense, is lesse then that which wee hope to see. whatsoeuer can bee offered to mine eye, sounded in mine eare, or made delightfull to my taste, it is lesse then that whereat I would be, and which I belieue certainly to enioy I will suspend the satisfaction of mine eyes, till the day come wherein I shall see my reedeemer,Iob. 19.27. whom with these eyes of mine I shal behold, and none other

for mee. Now I lou him and reioyce in hi sometime with ioy v speakable and glorious but shall neuer be con+tent till I see him, and fully enioy him.
A threefold precept to be obserued in vsing the things of this world.And because so long as we are here, natures necessitie compels vs to vse these things which fall vnder our sense, let vs in vsing of them ob|serue this threefold pre|cept: First, that we vse this world as if we vsed it not,1. Cor. 7.3. for the fashion of this world goes away: Secondly,1. Cor. 6.12. remember that all things are law|full,

but all are not ex|edient. And thirdly, at of these which are expedient,Ibid. it is not good thereby to come vnder the power of any thing, but to vse the Ser|uice of the Creature, and to keepe the heart vnthralled with the ser|uitude thereof: to vse in such sort things that are lawfull, that wee neuer lose for loue of them,The wicked walke by sight here and not by Faith, they shall neuer see better things nor these they see now. these which are more expedient, is a rare, and singular grace of God.
Last of all, this sen|tence being turned ouer let vs see the contrary

miserable estate and dis|position of the wicked they walke by sight, and not by faith, they haue no hope of better things, then these are, which are presently they enioy, they haue their portion in this life, they haue receiued their con|solation here, another heauen then that they haue on earth, can they not looke for: And how lamentable their estate is, two thinges among many,The Vanity of worldly pleasures discouered in two thinges. may declare vnto vs, first that these same pleasures, wherein they delight, if they bee con|tinuall,

are turned into ines: and therefore man craues to bee refre|shed alway with an ex|change, for that which now most earnestly hee longed for, in a short time becomes loth|some vnto him, so that he is forced to reiect it, and make choice of an|other. Secondly graunt that they could conti|nue without paine, yet can they not satisfie the soule of man,Eccles. 1.8 and this, as we are taught by Sa+lomon, we finde it in ex|perience, for the eye is not satisfied with seeing

nor the eare with hea|ring: Miserable there+fore are they who set their delight vpon such comfortlesse comforts.



VER. 8.
Neuerthelesse we are bold c.

The Apostle returnes to finish his se|cond con|clusion._IN this verse the Apostle returnes to finish his se|cond conclusion, which began at the sixt verse, and endes in this eight, it depends on the former this way, albeit we haue no such cleare sight of

these things vvherevnto we are called, as after this wee shall get, but onely walkes towards them by faith, yet for all that we are bold: or Ne|uerthelesse we are bold, c.
Our first lesson arising of this particle heere is this,How the impedime~ts of our faith tends to the greater commenda|tion there|of. the more impedi|ments we haue to stay vs from beleeuing, the greater is and shall bee the praise of our faith, if notwithstanding of the~ all wee continue in be|leeuing: There are two great tentations that impugne our faith, one

is the want of good,Bering of present e|uill, where|of we wou faine be re|leeued, our faith is try|ed. which God hath pro|mised, but we see it not: the other is the presence of euill, whereof now we would faine be relee|ued, and yet it lyeth still vpon vs.1. Pet. 1. Concerning this last, it is a notable saying the Apostle hath, we are now in heauines through manifold ten|tations, that the tryall of our faith, being much more precious then Gold, when it is tryed by fire, might bee found to our praise, honour, and glory, at the appea|ring of Christ, there we

see that the end of euills which now are suffered to lie vpon vs, is the try|all of our faith, and tha for our owne greater praise, and glory: for where no fire is, how can gold bee purged, where no trouble is, how can faith be tryed, and where faith is not yet tryed, how can it be praised.
And as to the other,By the De|lay of good things pro|mised which faine we would haue our faith is also tryed. when these good things which God hath promi|sed, are not seene of vs but hidden from our eyes, and delayed to bee performed vnto vs, this

is also for the tryall of our faith, for where we see saluation, what praise s it to beleeue: but where we can neither see nor feele the good things which God hath promised, but rather are exercised with contrary terrours and feares, if yet wee still cleaue to the truth of the wordofgod, that certainely is an ar|gument of a great faith,It is grea|test faith to beleeue where least is felt or seene. and such was the faith of that woman of Ca|naan, who beeing not onely refused, but as it were disdainefully re|iected by Christ, did so

trust vnto the truth of Gods word, that con|stantly shee looked fo mercy, at the hand o Christ, who strongly by word had denied it vnto her, and therefore recei|ued this commendation in the end, O woman great is thy faith, Thus we see how in he chil|dren of God, all these hinderances which wee hue to stay vs from be|leeuing, do so much the more commend, and approue our faith vnto God.
Wee loue rather. Of two loues wee see in

the Apostle,Of two loues the stronger ouercomes the wea in the Apo|stle. the stron|ger ouercomming the weaker, he loued his bo|dy,  protested before, he had no will to want it, but he loued the Lord Iesus better then his bo|dy, and therfore percei|uing that hee cannot now enioy them both together, for while hee was in the body, he was absent from the Lord, he is now very wel con|tent to remoue out of the body, that he might dwell with the Lord: there is nothing natural+ly a man loues more then his body, nothing

he feares more then death, because it imports a dissolution of his bo|dy, but where the loue of Christ is strong in the heart, it casts out not onely the feare of death, but ouer comes also all other loue whatsoeuer.
And here haue wee a point of holy wisedome discouered vnto vs,The readi|st way to be quit of the pertur|ation of our affecti|ons, is to set them vpon the right obiects. by which we may cure that vnquietnesse of minde, which arises in vs of the wandring of our af|fections after secondary obiects: the best way to remedy it, is to set our affections vpon the





right obiects, if the loue of the creature haue sna|red thee, set thy loue on the Lord, and bend thy affection toward him, and the othe shall not troble thee: If the feare of men terrifie thee, learne to sanctifie the Lord God in thine hart, make him thy feare, and and thou shalt not feare what flesh can doe vnto thee: and if the care of the world disquiet thee, cast thy care vpon God, and labour by conti|nuance in prayer, how to feele the sense of his loue toward thee in

Christ, and thou shalt finde, that where the one care like thornes did pricke thee with sorrowes the other shall bring contentment, peace, and ioy vnto thee.
But to returne,The strong loue of Christ that was in the Apostle con|demnes the cold loue that we haue to im. when we consider this strong loue of Christ, that was in the Apostle, wee we haue great cause to be ashamed of that weak and little loue, which in our heartes wee feele, towardes our LORD: how ma|ny this day professe that they loue him who

for his loue will not want the superfluities of this life, and what hope then is there that for his sake, they will lay down the life it selfe,How is it likely we wil giue our life for him who will not quit th su|perfluities of our life for him. if smaller crosses be vnpleasant to vs, and his loue be not so strong in vs, as to make vs reioice in them: how shall death be wel|commed of vs, wherin there is a concurse of all crosses into one: Wee must therefore learne, for the loue of Christ to inure our selues with the beginnings of mor|tification, not onely to slay the vnlawful affecti|ons,

but also to want ou wills euen in those things which are lawful: that so by degrees we may be inabled willing|ly to want the body and all that euer we lo|ued in the body for Ie|sus Christs sake.
To remooue out of the body.How death is discribed in regard of her effects toward the body, and toward the soule. Two manner of waies in this treatise doth the Apostle di|scribe death, first in re|gard of that which it doth to the body, and then he calleth it a disso|lution of our earthly Tabernacle: Next in regard of that which it

doth to the soule, and so he calles it a remouing out of the body, so that if we will think of death, as the spirit of God doth teach vs, there is no cause why wee should bee discouraged with it.
The death of the wic|ked is not a voluntary, but a com|pelled remo|uing.Againe we see heare, that the death of the godly is a voluntary re|moouing out of the bc|dy, to dwell with the Lord, as to the wicked like as they liue in dis|obedience, so they die in disobedience, their death is involuntary, that which is spoken

of that one wicked rich man,Luk. 12.20 O foole this night they will take thy soule from thee, is true in all the wicked, their spirits are taken from them against their will,Cyprian de mortal. exeunt istinc necessitatis vinculo, non voluntatis obsequio, whereas the Godly willingly commend their spirits into the handes of GOD, offe|ring vp both soule and body to him in death, in a full free and voluntarie oblati|on.
This difference be|tweene the death of the

Godly and wicked men may be commodiously shadowed by the fourth comming of Pharao his Butler,This diffe|rent death of the god|ly and , is sh+dowed in the ourth cmming of Pharao his Butler and Bker out o prison and Baker out of prison, whereof the one knew he shold be resto|red to serue the king his Master, and therefore went out with ioy, the other knew by Iosephs Prophesies hee should be hanged within three dayes, and therefore if it had beene giue to his choice, would still haue remained in prison, ra|ther then to haue come foorth to be hanged: e|uen so is it with the

godly, who are certified before hand, that they are receiued into fauor, and after death shall haue pla to stand a|bout the throne of God, there to serue him by praising him continual|ly, are well content whe~ the Lord cals them to remoue out of the body whereas the other ha|ving receiued a sentence of condemnation with|in themselues, no mar|uaile they go out of the body, with feare and trembling, like malefa|ctors going from the prison, to the place of

execution, vincti  im|pliciti catenis variorum peccatorum ad terrible illud iudicium trahuntur.Chrisost in Math. .
Or if the wicked die willingly, they die im|patiently not for any loue to be with Christ.Or otherway if at a|ny time the wicked bee willing to dye, it is not for any loue or know|ledge they haue, that they shall be with the Lord, but either els be|cause they are impatient of such heauy crosses as are vpon their bodies, or else because they cannot endure the ter|rours of a iust accusing conscience, for these causes oftentimes they haue beeene forced to

seeke reliefe, by making their refuge to the bo|some of death, reliefe  wicked get by put|ting hand in them selfs is no better nor if a man, o saue him|selfe from water shold leape in the fire. as did Saul, Achitophell and Iu|das, but all in vaine, for by new sins the worme of conscience is further wakened, but not extin|guished, the breath of naturall life, thereby maybe suffocate, but the giltinesse of an euill conscience is encrea|sed: so that in this their refuge of vanity they finde no more ease to their weary spi|rits, then if a man to es|chew death by water, should leap into the fire,

which is no other thing in effect, but to ex|change a smaller paine with a greater, it being most certaine, that all the paines which wic|ked men sustaine in this life, if they bee compa|red with the paines of Hell,Paines of this life com+pared with paines of hell, are but like reeke going before the fire. are but like vnto reeke or smoake, which goes before the fire. If in the body they may not abide the smoake of Gods wrath, how shall they abide to bee burnt with the fire thereof in hell, Yet in this confu|sed and perturbed estate goe they out of the

world, finding and fee|ling they are not well where they are, and for|warned by their consci|ence, that a worse a|bides them.
Two things then are requisite to make vs wil|ling,He cannot remooue willingly and well out of the body, who finds not a hand behind him to put him out, and an|other before him to re|ceiue him. with comfort to remooue out of the bo|dy. The first is, that the sense of our miserie, makes vs wearie of this life, seeing here wee are absent from the Lord the next is, that the hope of a better makes vs wil|ling to remooue, know|ing that we shall dwell with the Lord: The one

is as a hand behind vs to put vs out of the world: The other is as a hand stretched out before to receiue vs into a better: if the sense of misery put vs not out, we shal be lik Israel, delighting rather ot bide vnder banishme~t in Babell, then to follow Gods calling to Cana|an: and againe if the sense of mercy make vs not certaine of a better we shall bee like them, who finding a hand be|hind them to put them out, but none before them to take a gripe of them and pull them o|uer,

cannot but in most miserable manner fall downe into that pit, and gulfe, which is betweene the two prepared for the damned.
Soules of good men remouing out of the body dwelt with the Lord.And dwell with the Lord. Here we see that the soules of the godly after their remoouing out of the body, haue their dwelling with the Lord, it is not then as some suppose, that the soules haue any other resting place but hea|uen, wherin they are till Christ his second com|ming, with which wrong opinion some

of the learned haue bin stained, whose names with thei nakednesse we delight not to disco|uer, but as the Israelites did to the Egyptians, wee will borrow their Gold and Siluer, and vse it as our owne, leauing their Claye and Bricke vnto themselues, and will rest vpon this most sure word of the Lord, that our Soules remoo+uing out of the body, shall dwell with the Lord. What our Saui|our said to that Con|uert on the Crosse, be|longs also after Death,

to all the rest of his chil|dren, This night thou shalt be with me in Para|dise,Athanas. Quest. 19. Non enim propter solam latroni animam, Christus Deus noster para|dis um aperuit, Sed ob re|liquas etiam Sanctorum animas.
Againe,Mourning therefore should not be made for them who are depar|ted, but for our seues who rmain wee learne here that seeing Saints departed are but flitted to dwell wih the Lord, we should so moderate our mourning for them, that we lament not their estate, seeing they haue changed for a better, but our owne, who sustaine by their departure a

twofold losse: First that such notable instrume~ts of comfort,First be|cause they were plags of Gods f|uour to vs. as haue bin pledges to vs of Gods fauour should bee taken from vs, suh was the mourning of the Faith|full for S. Stephen,Acts 8. and of the Elders of Ephesus,A 0. for Saint Paul, when hee tolde them, that they should see his face no more.Next be|cause the taking away of good men is a fore|runner of euill dayes. Secondly, be|cause the taken away of godly men is a forerun|ner of euill dayes to fol|low, the godly are as Pillars in a Citie,Esa. 57. like as Lot was in Sodome, to hold backe the iudge|ment

of God from it, thus wee see how in the death of others be|loued of vs, the causes of mourning should re|spect our selues,The mour+ning to be made for them should be  their death not after it is Dauid did.  Sam. 12.16. and not them, and as for that which may concerne them, if any cause of mourning be, it should bee before their death and not after it, as Dauid did, who when his child was stroken with the hand of God, he fasted and mourned for him seauen daies together, but when hee saw that the Lord would not bee intreated to spare

him, his seruants hauing tolde him that the childe was dead, then he arose, and refreshed himselfe with meate, teaching vs that the best time of mourning for those whom we loue, is to mourne for them while they are aliue, that so we may entreat the Lord to spare them, or then to receive them into his fauour, and not to take them away in the continuance of his anger,But we com+monl begin not ou mourning, till the time of mourning e past. but the contrary commonly is done by vs, for then doe wee be|gin our mourning, whe~

the time of mourning for them is past, that is when the iudgement is giuen out, both vpon their soules and bodies, which by no intreaty of ours can be reuoked.
Last of all,Comforta|ble is it that our  in heauen is called a dwelling: for it shewes comforta|ble is it, that our estate after this life, is called a dwelling with the Lord, it is not a soiourning in a tabernacle as heere we are, but a dwelling in an euerlasting habitation, the Lord Iesus shall sta|blish vs there,1. That we shall ne|uer re|moue out of it. Reuel. 3.12. as well grounded pillars in the temple of our God, and we shal neuer any more

goe out:That we shall haue sufficient furniture of all good  it. and againe see|ing that is the place of the dwelling of God with his Saints, and of them with him, it offe|reth to our considerati|on, that great variety of good without any want which there abydes vs: for if vpon earth Men of power haue their dwel|ling places aboundant|ly furnished with all necessary good, what shall wee looke for in the dwelling house of our God,Psal. 65.4. Blessed is hee whom thou chusest, and causest to come to thee, hee shall dwell in thy courts

and we shall bee satisfied with the pleasures of thine house: The best creatures which serue vs now, shall not get that honour, as to serue vs there,Reuel. 21 23. There is no neede of the Sunne, nor of the Moone to shine in that Citie, for the glory of God doth light it, and the Lambe is the light thereof, The Lord him|selfe shall bee all things in all vnto vs,Bern. VVhat can be lacking where God shall be A|nma Ani|mae, yea all things in all vnto vs. In a word then Anima, Animae erit Deus, God shall bee the soule of our soule, he onely shall mooue it, he only shall possesse it

with him onely shall it be delighted, filled, and fully satisfied: We con|clude then with Dauid, How excellent is thy mer|cy O God,Psal 36.78 therefore the children of men trust vn|der the shadow of thy winges: They shall be satis|fied with the fatnesse of thine house, and thou shalt giue them drinke out of the riuers of thy pleasures for with thee is the well of life, and in thy light shall we see light.
O what a loue of God is here, discouered vnto vs, Angells made Apostasie from God,

and mercy neuer  to them to restore them,Apostt man recei|ued to mer|cy and set in the pace  wich Apostat An+gels fell without re|cuery. Iude 6. Man also made Apostasie from God,  mercy is both offered,  giuen vnto him to re|store him: Angells left their habitation, and are now reserued in chaines vnder dakenesse to the iudgement of the great day, Man is translated from the Kingdome of darkenesse, to be raysed vp to the place from which Angels fell: And where that state of glo|ry was not made sure to Angels, for they lft their first estate, it is

made sure to man, wee shall so be placed there, that we shal dwel there, neuer any more to bee remooued from it, so hath the Lord declared the riches of his mercy vpon vs, his holy name be praised therefore.
Th ole reasons which make the godly willing to remooue out of the body are taken vp in three.Now out of all this, let vs tak vp in one short Sum, the reasons which here moued the Apo|stle and makes all the rest of Gods children willingly content to re|moue out of the body, we reduce the~ to three.1. The misery present. First the miserie vnder which weely while wee

are in the body,2. The felicity to come. Next the Felicity to which we goe, when wee remoue out of the body,3. he helpes for the iour|ney. and thirdly the helpes wee haue to carry vs on in this iourney, fro~ the bo|dy to the Lord: and these are not vnlike those 3. motiues, which made Ia|cob willing to depart fro~ Canaan, suppose it was the Land of promise, to the land of Egypt, wher|in he knew his seed shold be afflicted,Shadowed in three the like, which made Ia|cob willing to goe fro~ E|gypt to Ca|nan. 1. the scarsity and famine which was in Canaan, Next the plenty that was in E|gypt, whereof Ioseph

his beloued sonne, was gouernor and dispenser liuing there in great ho|nour, notwithstanding that all his fathers house supposed him to haue beene dead and rotten: and thirdly the oracle of God warrnting him to goe, and the Chariots which were sent by Io|seph to helpe him in the iourney, but we haue (as I said) three greater mo|tiues to make vs willing to goe from this Egypt, a land of darkenesse, a house of vile seruitude and bondage, to our hea+uenly Canaan.
For 1. what haue we here in this life,In this life is a feare|ful famine of all good. but a ferefull famine and scarsitie of all thinges which are truely good, it is not worthy of the name of good, which commonly among men is esteemed good, Psa. . non so|lum quia facilem habeat ad res contrarias conuer|ionem, se quod etiam pos|sessores suos meliores red dere non valeat, not one|ly because it is easily tur|ned into a contrary e|uil,And the best things which are here makes not their possessors batter. but also for that it is not able to make the possessors there, of any better, and what a good

I pray you can that bee, by which he is not made good that possesses it, Beatus ille qui post illa non abiit,Ber. quae assequi mi|serum est, quia possessa o|ner ant, amata inquinant amissa crusiant: happy is he that walkes not af|ter these things, which to obtaine is a misery, because being possessed they burden vs, being loued they defile vs, be|ing lost they torment vs, and truely no bet|ter are the best thinges which growe heere, in this land of our Pilgri|mage and absence from

God. Our life is but an exchanging of many sorrowes, we liue in the body like Israel in the Wildernesse in danger to bee sting'de euery houre with fiery Ser|pents, like Daniell in the Den, in danger to be de|uoured by Lyons, like Lot in Sodo~, vexed with the vncleannesse which is within vs in our selues,  without vs in others.
But were it so,But albeit good things were here, yet were they to be exchanged for better. that we had abundance of good things in this life, yet shold webe co~tent to go from them, seeing we know that by so doing we shal exchange for a

a better: for euen now while we are in by bo|dy, we may finde the ex|perience, that at no time wee haue such ioy in the spirit, as when by feruent prayer, and hea|uenly contemplation, after a sort wee are raui|shed, and transported out of the body, to walke with God and haue fa|miliar conuersatio~ with him, whereas otherway when the soule comes downe from contem|plation, to exercice her function by externall senses, toward these things which are below,

then is shee incontinent disquieted with pertur|bations,How the soule is a|bused in the body. so that she can|not looke out by the eye, and not be infected, nor heare by the eare. and not bee distracted, nor touch by the hand, and not be defiled. Thus if the soul take a view of the thinges of this world by the senses, a world of strange cogi+tations are wakened in her, which quickly a|gaine euanishes, if the soule forsaking the fami|liar vse of the senses by continuance in prayer ascend vnto God,Tun

anima non fallitur,Ambros. d bono mortis. cap 3. quan|do solium veritatis attin|git, quando se scernit ab isto corpore, decipiturenim visu oculorum auditu au|rium.
The Sole hath her great  ioy out of the body, while the body be glo|rified.That same reason by which Athanasius did prooue that the Soule liues out of the body, may serue to prooue, that it shall liue in grea|test peace, and ioye out of the body, Si enim con|nexa corpori,Athanas. Cont. Gent. extra Cor|pus vitam agit, corpore enim in lectulo cubante, as velut in morte quies|cente, ipsa naturam corpo|ris transilit, For if the

Soule, euen while it is knit to the body, liues a life without the body, as may bee seene, in that while the body is slee|ping, and as it were re|sting in death, the Soule transcends the nature of the body, howe much more shall wee thinke, that out of the body, it liues the own quiet, and peaceable life, deliuered from this waltring Sea of restesse temptations wherein it is tossed too and fro, so long as it is in the body.
And as to the second if wee looke to these

things,In heauen is wealth and safetie of all good things. which are be|fore vs in heauen, there is our most louing Fa|ther, in whose face is the fulnesse of ioye, and at whose right hand are pleasures for euer. More there is not our yonger, but our elder brother li|uing and rayning in glo|rie, he once died for our Sinnes, but he is risen a|gaine and gone vp be|fore vs, to prepare a place for vs. Since hee is the fairest among the children of men,VVhat a blessed com|panie shall we be ga|thered vnto there. and we haue not yet scene him, if we loue him, why doe wee not long to goe to

him? Many also of our beloued are gone there before vs to that assem|bly,Heb 12. and Congregation of the first orne, wher|in are the Spirits of iust and perfect men, and to the which, all these Sonnes of God, which shall remaine behind vs, shall shortly bee gathe|red, and shall it be grie|uous to vs to remooue to so sweete a fellow|lowship, when it shall please GOD in our cours to call vpon vs.
And thirdly,3. VVe haue notable helps to carie vs forward in the iourney. we haue most notable helpes gi|uen of God, to aduance

vs in our iourney, for not onely haue wee the Oracle of God to war|rant vs from all euill which may follow vp|on our remoouing,1. The Oracle to warrant vs. and to assure vs of a ioyfull welcome, Come thou faithfull seruant,Luk 17 and en|ter into thy Masters rest, And againe, Blessed are they that die in the Lord, for they rest from their la|bour:2. The Chari|ots of An|gels to con|uey vs. But we haue also Chariots, which our el|dest Brother hath sent to attend vs, and con|uey vs in our iourney, these are his holy An|gels, who conueyed the

Soule of Lazarus from the dunghill vnto Abra|hams bosom, euen these same fierie Chariotes, which tooke vp Elijah into heauen, waite vp|on vs also to carie vs vp, when the time of our Transmigration shall come.
Besides that,3. The holy spi|rit within vs to con|duct vs. we haue also with vs the holy Spirit of promise, who as he is sent in our harts, to witnesse the loue of God vnto vs, so doeth he remaine with vs, in the troubles of our life hee comforts vs in the

terrours of Death, hee strengthens vs, and in al the way wherein wee haue to walke, he guides and conducts vs, till at|length he put vs in pos|session of that inheri|tance. whereunto hee hath Sealed vs,  wher|of then shall we bee a|fraide.
An Exhor|tation to courage in Death. Col. 3 1. Seing then wee are compassed with so ma|ny and great comforts, let vs in time transport our affections vpward towards heauen, where Christ is at the right hand of God, let vs liue in the body ready to go

out of the body, when God shall call vs watch|ing, and praying conti|nually, for we know not the hower. Beware that wee lie not downe into the hollow of our hearts, to sleepe in care|lesse securitie, as Ionus sleeped in the sides of the Ship, least the feare|full tempest of Gods wrath come vpon vs vnwares to wallow vs, and wrap vs vp in end|lesse confussion, woe be to him that shall bee found sleeping in his sines, when the Lord cals vpon him to come

out of the body.How wee should stan ready to welcome it. But let vs stand prepared like Is|rael at the Passeouer with our loynes girded vp, and our staffe in our hand, waiting when the Lord shall warne vs to remooue. As the Birds which are desirous to flie, stretch out their wings, so the Soule, that would be with the Lord should first stretch out her affections toward him. Or as Abraham sitting in the doore of his Tabernacle, when the Angels came to him, and Eliah standing in the mouthe of his

Caue, that hee might meete with the Lord, so should we soiourn in the body, that we come out to the dore, to the mouth of the borders of it ready alway to remoue out of it, that wee may be with the Lord,Luk. .7 Bles|sed are these seruants whom the Lord, when he comes,Naturalists sometimes shw a cou|rage in death, which is not Christian confidence. shall finde waking.
And thus much con|cerning these reasons which makes the Godly willing to remoue out of the body, haue wee obserued, not onely for the comfort of Gods children, but aso to di|stinguish

the death of the worldling from the death of the Christian, for oftentimes in natu|rall men, there is seene a carnall boldnes to die, by which they enforce themselues to dye cou|ragious, and (as they cal it) like men, which nei|ther workes in them for the present any inward contentment, nor yet assures the~ of any grea|ter comfort, when they goe out of the body, it is no more but the last puffe of their naturall pride, which soone eua|nishes, and is not Chri|stian

Magnanimitie flo|wing from inward con|solation of the Spirit:ither in ing, nor suffering doth God looke to the shew, but to the power. Surely neither in suffe+ring nor in doing, doth the Lord regard the out+ward shew of Godlines, but the power, Non e|nim florem interrogat, sed radicem, Neither are we to thinke much of those who being but Martyrs Satanice Virtutis: doe in externall appearance dy with boldnes, as may be seene in many, who be|ing of an euill conuer|sation, die for the main|tenance of an euill cause neither ashamed of the

one nor the other, these may pretend courage in the face, but be sure can haue no comfort in the conscience.



VER. 9.
Wherefore also wee Couet that, c.

The third ruit of god|lines which he Apostle gathers of his generall grund of comfort. _WE come now to the 3. con|clusio~, which the Apostle inferres vpon his former ground of co~fort: which is that the certain know|ledg of the glory to com wrought in him a care both in life and death,

to be acceptable to god, and this conclusion is very well annexed to the former, they cannot be seperat: he that loues to dwell with the Lord, no doubt will haue a care to please him, wee see by experience, how carefull we are to please those with whome wee are to dwell but a short while vpon earth, much more will we be careful to please the Lord, if so be we desire for euer to dwell with him: and a|gaine, where there is in the life a care to please the Lord, there is also in

death a boldnesse to go to him, whereas an euill conscience desires not to heare the Lord, farre+lesse dare it ee bold to see him.
We Couet.The Apostles holy ambiti|on by  he  with God. The word which here the Apostle ves commonly signifies an ambitious coueting of honour: but here the Apostle vses it to the best, to expresse his most earnest, and sincere affe|ction, which caried him to loue this honour, that he might bee in fauour with the Lord his God, esteeming it the highest honour, to bee accepta|ble

to the Lord his God, not to be greatwith men ofworldly power, which is the greatest designe of those who can mount no higher, then the earth, bt to bee eat with God, there|fore protests hee that where away soeuer, the affections of other men goe, this is the honour which hee loued, that both in life, and death, he might be acceptable to God.
As to that honour which may come to vs,Honour which comes by courting wth men, is an euni|shing shad|dow. from the countenance ofman, by courting

with them it is but an e|unishing shadow, they themselues in their best estate are altogether va|nity, they are but like vn|to grasse, and their glory fades as a flower of the field, and what true ho|nour then can they communicate to vs? let the most glorious Mo|narch, who euer liued in the world, be presented to vs, let him bee pla|ced in his Chariot of Triumph,Two questi|ons to disco|uer t a|nit o  man in his best estate. decked in most gorgeous maner, with all magnificence that can be devised: two questions propounded

to him shall quickely discouer his vanitie:1. VVhat hath he to ke vp  magni|ence whi hee ha ot  the . First what hath he here which is his owne, let that which ee borrow|ed from the creature to make vp his begged glo|ry bee taken from him, and what behinde shall remaine vnto him? Next that state ofho|nour wherein he stands how long shal he conti|nue in it:2. How long shall he tand in that state of honour. that Samaritan Prince, who this day lea|ned on the KINGES shoulder, and the next day was trampled vn|der the peoples feete may serue among

many other inumerable examples, to shew how short and vaine the glo|ry of flesh is, as Nebu|chadnezars mage had a head of Gold, but feere o yron, and clay, so is it with all the glorious pompe of worldlings, golden in the beginning but the ende thereof is dust and ashes.
Both the Christian and the worldlings seekes life, riches, and honour.If wee compare the Christian  the world|ling together, wee shall see that both of them shoots at life, riches, and honour, these are the common endes of all mens actions, but where

the one pursues after ap|parens bonum, the other folowes after Reuer a bo|num, they folow shewes the other e substance, they are busied about the Chaffe, the  followes e shadow , the other the substance. Christ. in Math. hom. 11. the Christi|an is seeking the Corne, externall things cannot content him, frumentum paeis mensura minus est, led natura pretio sius, as Corne, suppose it to be lesse i measure then the Chaffe, yet is it more pretious in Nature, so doe they know that in|ward, spirituall  inuisi|ble goods, are the most excellent. With me ( saies

Wisedome) are durable ri|ches and honour,Pro. . this life is but a shaddow: but Wisedome calles vs to the fellowsip of an e|uerlasting life, all the ho|nour that is from the worlds, endes in shame, but the honour which is from God is durable fugiamus ergo hinc,Ambros. de fuga saeculi cap. 5. vbi nihil est, vbi inane est om|ne quod magnificum pu|tatur, vbi qui seputat ali|quid esse, nihil est, let us therefore flie out of this world, in the which there is nothing, in the which, that which is thoght to be most mag|nified,

is indeed but vani|ty, and he who thinkes himselfe to bee some|thing, in very deed is no|thing, reliquamus vm|bram qui sole~ querimus, let vs forsake the sha|dow, who seeke the Sun, and follow those things which by true light are discouered to vs to bee best.Religion takes not a|way affecti|ons, but re|ctifies them. Againe we see here how religion takes not away from the Christia~ naturall affections, but only rectifies them, the Lord who in the 1. crea|tion made them, in the regeneratio~, doth renue them tempering the~ in

measure and setting he~ vpon the right obiects, for the affections so long as they are either distempered and out of measure, or then diuer|ted from their own pro|per obiects, they breed in vs manifolde restlesse perturbations,Affecons distempera or diuerted from their right ob|iects breede vs trouble euen as the strings of an instru|mentpunc; beeing distempe|red, (if ye touch them) send out a very vngrate|ull sound, where o her way being rightly set, by the hand of the Musiti+an, they end out most pleasant melodie, so is it with the afections, if

they be temperedby the spirit of God, and set vp|on the right obiects, they worke in vs a quiet meeke and peaceabl spirit, and this is the great benefite wee haue by religion and godli|nes, that our affections which are like to furi|ous Beastes, are tamed to our hand, since by nature we are covetous of honour, religion tea|ches how to cuet the best honour, and where by nature we cannot be without care, religion teaches vs how to bend our care to please God

that godly care may cause co~fort to vs, where the carnal is thorny, that doth but prick,  disqui|et vs, and so orth of the  of the affections.
Two  requi sit hold |fections mo|derate.Now for this mode|ration of our affections, because they are sooner commoued, then water is with the winde: Two things are most necessa|rie: One is, that we haue continually in our mind some short precepts of the word, commanding vs how to temper them, and next that with the precepts we bee instant in Prayer to God, the

whole nature of beasts hath beene tamed by the nature of man,Iam. 3.7 but the nature of man, no man is able to tame, what is spoken of the tongue, is true of our whole nature, it is an vnruly euill, wee must therefore seeke it may be done by God, which is not possible to bee done by man.
That both dwelling at home,The godly consecrate not their deathonely, but their life also to God c.] But now to returne. The Apostle protests that both dwel|ling at home, and re|mooving from home, that is both in life, and

in death it was his grea|test desire to bee accep|table to GOD. It is certaine that Ioab as prophane a man as hee was in his life, yet when he was straited by death, ranne to the hornes of the Atar,All men faine  death to seeke the Lord. so the most prophane and wicked men, when they come to the point of Death, would giue al the world if they had it, for the fa|vour of God, then are they content to heare the Preacher, then de|sire they some comfort of the word, and that Prayers by the Church

shold be made vnto God for them.Desiring in death the meanes of reconcilia| which  they . In a word, those same meanes of re|conciliation with God, which they despised in their life, they desi them in death, but here is wisedome in time to do that which we must bee faine to doe at the length. I see no other difference betwene these wise and foolish Virgins in that Parable, but that the one did that in time, which the other would faine haue done out of time, but in vaine. And the Apostle here stands vnto vs for an example

of this holy wisedome, he offered vp himselfe in a whole burnt offering to GOD, keeping no|thing backe, nor diui|ding euill, as the maner of foolish men is.
They  uil  giue  young yeers to Satan  their old daies to the Lord.What greater folly then this, that thy dying dayes thou resoluest to offer them vnto God and the dayes of thy life, thou giuest them to the seruice of Satan and sin: for euill diuiding, Saule lost his Kingdome, for euill diuiding Ananias and Saphira lost their liues, but worse diui+ders are they, who will

giue their young yeeres vnto Satan, and their old and feeble age to the Lord,Such vnder go Mala|hi cursse . this is to incurre that fearefull curse, Cur|sed be he that hath a male in his flocke, 1. and vowes, and Sacrifices a corrupt thing vnto the LORD. Surely, as the carelesse Husband-man, whoe sowes nothing in spring time, Reapes nothing in Haruest: So he who in his life sowes not the seede of teares out of a penitent heart, how shal hee gather in death the fruit o ioy, yea rather as the idolatrous Israe|lites,

when by many A|postasies they had pro|uoked the Lord to an|ger,And haue cause to feare this fearefull answere to be giue  them  death: Iud. . got this fearefull answere from him, Goe to the gods, whom yee haue chosen, let them saue you in the time of your tribu|lation: So may they looke for the like aun|swere, who in their life liue as Rebels vnto God, and then in death wil pray the Lord to re|ceiue them? No goe your way to the Ma|sters whome yee haue serued, and let them re|ceiue you.
Now all this delay of

Repentance,Delay of Repentance till old age is procured by Satans . whereby men defer to doe that in their life, which faine they would do in death, comes to psse of Sa|tans singular Policie who craftily steales a|way from men the time of Grace, he dare not be so impudent, as to say plainely to the wicked man, yee neede not re|pent at all, he craues no more but a supersedere, yee neede not to repent as yet, euery day hee tempts thee with a new baite, and so makes thee put off from day to day, till the last day come

wherein thou arT sud|denly taken away, be|fore thou canst put or|der to thy thoughts, for then a multitude of sins gathers against thee and confounds thee, where if thou hadst fought a|gainst the~ seuerally be|fore, thou mightst easi|lyhaue ouercome them. As in bodily diseases,Protract of time makes diseases more incu|rable. protract of time makes them the more incure|able, so is it in the spiri|tuall, for no sinne ends there where it begins, but if it bee suffered to continue, makes a pro|gresse alwayes to the worse.
It is written of Pha|rao,Miserable Pharao de|layed his de|liu rance till the mor|ro. that being plagued with Frogges, that Mo|ses offered to him; Con|cerning me, command when thou wilt that I shall pray for thee, and the Frogges shall bee taken from thee, and sent into the Riuer,. 8.9. hee answered him, Pray for me to morrow: what a misery is this, the plague of God is vpon him, and God offers by his serua~t to take it fro~ him at such a time as hee himselfe shold appoint,  yet the blind  hard hatred ma~ hath no grace presently

to seeke the remedy, but puts it of til to morrow: but truely more misera|ble are they to whom God by his Gospel eue|ry day offers mercy,More |rable they  lay th |ceiuing the  the  to an other time. and grace, saying as much to them in effect as, when wilt thou that I shal take thy sins from thee, when wilt thou that I deliuer thee from the death vn|der which thou lyest, but truely the answer which is giuen to the Lord is worse then that answere of Pharao, for in effect this it is, no till the mor|row, yea no till the next yeare and which is worst

of al, no til mine old age: Let me first go, and kisse my father, then wil I come, and follow thee let me first delight my selfe with the pleasur of corrupt nature: and then shall I amend my life, and become godly, issoluta certe,Aug. ad frat. in Ere|mo ser. 71.  paralyti|ca vox est de crastina cogi|tare conuersione, hodier|nam negligere.
Our carefull expediti|on to preuent all euills may befal to our bodies,Bodily uils we remedy wthout any delay. may iustly conuict vs for this carelessnes, that we haue of our owne salua|tion, no man beares a

burden longer then con+uenie~tly he may be quit of it, no man is soonr wounded in his body, but incontnent he cries for a Phisitian, and if fire enter into the house, there is hast made for water to quench it, shall we be so wise in thinges pertaining to our bo|dies, and prooue foolish as concerning our souls?But are not so wise as concerning our soules. why delight we to beare the burden of our sinnes any longer, since the Lord Iesus offers to re|liue vs of it, wee are wounded to the death, and will not receiue the

Oyle of that sweet Sa|maritan that we may be cured, the fire of Gods wrath is kindled against vs, and we make no hast to get water out of t fountaine of Dauids house, which only is able to quench  slaken it: So soone as the Angell troubled the waters of Siloam,Ioh. 5. so soone such as were diseased, hasted to step downe into it, that they might be healed the liuely and whole|some waters of Shiloh able to cur all out spe|rituall diseases, flowes a|boundantly among vs,

but alas we delay to seek our health in them.
He that liues in hope of a lo lie, sha liue  care  make  good.But if it bee so that thou liuest in hope, thy dayes will be long, why wilt thou not fall to in me, and make them also good: for if God make thy daies log, and thou thy self make them euill by continuall sin|ning, dot thou not turn good into eull and so increaeft double wrath and iudgment vpon thy selfe.All thines that a man hath, he would haue it good, ony e makes is life euil. Take heed to thy selfe, and consider how euery thing which is thine, thou wouldst faine haue it good, and pre|sest

dayly to make it bet|ter, if thou haue children thou wouldst haue them good, if thou haue land, thou woulst haue it good, thy house, thy gar+ments and all that thi is, thou wilt haue them good, onely heere thou forgets thy selfe, that thy owne life thou suffers to be euill, and so Intr omnia bona tua ipse ma|lus es, in the midle of all thy good thinges, thou thy selfe onely art found euill.
The late repentance of the wicked,The late re|pntance of men flls ot often like tht of Esau. falles out commonly to bee like

vnto that of Esau, hee sought the blessing with teares, but hee found it not and it is the com|mon iudgment of all he wicked, ee loued cursing and it shal come vpon him,Psal. .17. he loue not blessing, and it shall bee far from him, they farre deceiue themsels who tinke they may when they will, euen in an in|stant returne to the Lord: Many knotts that are surely casten, are not easily loosed,After long wandring from God it is not ea|si to return to him.  the heart which Satan hath bou~d of along time, with the cords of manifold trans|gressions,

is not easily mde free againe, Ioseph and Mary lost Christ at Ierusalem, and went a daies iourny from him, but sought him again three daies, before th could finde him, and thinkest thou who al thy daies hast liued in rebellion against God, that it is easie in a mo|ment, to be reconciled with him?
Wee see by daily ex|perience howe often it comes to pass,In Gods iudgeme t fals osten out, that he who in life forgets God in death orgets hm selfe. Vt hac a|nim duersione percuta|tur peccator, vt morien obliuiscatur sui, qui dum

viueret oblitus est Dei. That with this fearefull iudgement, a sinner is stricken, that in death he forgets hielfe, who in is life did forget the ord, as we see many of tem suddenly taken a|way in their sinnes in such sort, that not onely sense, but reson and memory also is taken from them. Men for their pleasure do i such fort, diuide their life and death, that they liue in that state wherein nei|ther intend they to die neither dare they dye, and God for their pu|nishment,

forsakes them, letting them die in that same sinful estate, wherein they liued. who  will not  in  can|n  by Satan snared to destruction. Thus betwene two, they fall into hell, whil in their young yeare they will not,  in thei olde age they cannot re|pent. But if we with the Apostle will not delay in our life carefully to please him, then in our death shall we be accep|table to him: If our life be the life of the righte|ous, out of doubt wee shall dye the death of righteous, and bee wel|commed of God with

that ioyfull sentence, Come to me thou faith|full seruant, which God of his mercy graunt to vs, for Iesus Christs sake to whome be praise and glory for euer.
FINIS.
