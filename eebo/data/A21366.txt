An Epistle writen and sent vnto the
Communialtie of Loue, by the cho|sen
Minister in thesame.
IN-as-much as that ther
is Mercie chaunced vnto me / 
through the Loue of God the
Father, so is my Spirit incli|ned
to thesame Spirit of God
the Father, and also to y^e Ser|ice
of my Neighbour: and that altogether to
hesame Loue.
. To the Communialtie in the Loue, vnto
whom wee wish in the Lorde / much Felicitie,
Health, and Saluation.
. MY Beloued in the Lorde, the cause of
my writing of this Epistle vnto you, is
o geeue your Loues to vnderstand, that the
orde through his elected Minister HN, hath
cripturelie setfourth and declared in full and
mple maner / the Mans Falling awaye tho|ough
the Disobedience; from his God, and
lso his right Conuertion by Repentaunce;
nto God: and in like maner how hee should
e instructed, to his Growing-vp in the God|nes / 
euen vnto the euerlasting Life. Hee hath
so brought-fourth through thesame his elec|d
Minister; certen Epistles of Correction
nd Exhortatio~ out of heartie Loue, to a pluc|ing
vnder the Obedience of the Loue, and to
epentaunce for y^e Sinnes, vnto them which
ink themselues wise, and therfore blaspheam

our Seruice  our Communialtie in the Lou
Othersom also / as Exhortations, to warne th
Louers of the Trueth / of all false Visions an
Spirites, which makevp themselues out of th
wicked World / in this last daungerous Tim
4. In conclusion, ther is sufficient to answe
eueryone, of what Minde ether Opinion soeuer
hee be, if hee will be answered by y^e Trut
And therfore wee need to doo no more, but 
make-manifest those-same Exhortations / 
conuenient time, as the cause doth require it.
5. Notwithstanding, although wee through
the Goodnes of the Lorde; doo our dligence
to make-manifest the Woorkes of th
Lorde, to his Laude and Praise, and to y^e Con+uerting
of Sinners from their Sinnes, and to induce
or leade them to an vpright Life / bo
before God and Men, Yet are wee counted 
iudged for Seducers: and are slaundered wit
all Wickednes, and bruted for Euel-dooer
And thissame is assuredlie a great Miserie vpo
the Earth.
6. Whoso then can now in this wicke
Time / perceaue such wicked Deedes, The
may also perceaue therout, that thissame Tim
is euenlike as was the Time of Noe in the former
corrupted World, and as the Time of Lo
in Sodom and Gomor: and that in thesame Tim
all Iniquitie and Falshod doth beare-swaye.
7. They may farder note and perceaue, th
in this self-same Time / the World is couere
ouer with the Darknesses of Egipt, with th
Plagues of Phara, with the Ignoraunce of th

ananites, with the Contention and Discord of
e intangled Babel, with the Deceit and Insti|tion
of the false God seruices of Ieroboam, with
 wicked Enterprise or Deuice of Iezabel, with
e sectuarish Spitefulnes of the Scripture-lear|ed
and of the Pharisees and Saducees, with the
mbition of Pilate, and with the Tirannie of
, as also with all heathenish Instabilitie: and
at the Destruction is hard-at-hand.
FOr-as-much then my Beloued in the
Lorde; as that ther are now so manye
rrible and abhominable Euels risenvpp in
ese Dayes: wherby wee see that the Abho|nation
of Desolation possesseth the Holie,
erof ther is prophecied by the Lorde Iesus
ist: and that ther are also false Christes and
se Propheates, euen as ther were manye in
se Dayes, which madevp themselues when
 Lorde Iesus was personallie vpo~ the Earth;
elliousie and blaspheamouslie: So are ther
 now in this last Daye which is the Com|-againe
of the Lorde Iesus Christ, with the
y Thowsandes of his Sainctes, according
he Promises; many Offallers, Aduersaries,
 Resisters, which makevp themselues re|iouslie
and blaspheamouslie / against the
de and his most-holie Seruice of Loue: of
which som of them haue made-manifest
selues, and their Names / by their slaun|us
Bookes: namelie these are knowne vn|
in England, Stephan Bateman (in his Booke
uled The golden Booke of the leaden Gods: and
hn Rogers Booke / To the Reader) Iohn Rogers

(in his Booke intituled The Displaying of the Famlie
of Loue) and Iohn Knewstub and his Companons
(in his Booke intituled 1. Knewstub against 
Heresies of HN) together with their slaundero
Blaspheamies, Cainish bloud-thirstie Tira+nie,
and extreeme Persecution / for to shead 
innocent and giltles Bloud.
9. For which occasio~ / wee are forced through
the Loue which wee haue vnto G
and our Neighbour; to translate this Epistle
Reproofe and Exhortation heerafter follo+ing out
of the Woorkes which are gon-fou
through Abia Nazarenus, a Fellow-elder w
HN in the Familie of Loue: wherby it mou
be knowne, how the Lorde hath mooued
elected Elders, to write against the Blasphmers,
Backbyters, and Slaunderers. c. 
therfore wee will not contend with them,
submit our cause vnto the Almightie, and h
vpon his Goodnes.
10. Howbeit wee haue thought it goo
make-manifest their Names / which are 
pheamous Writers: desiring the Goodwi
which loue God  his Righteousnes, to 
intercession with vs vnto the almightie 
head, with these or such-like Wordes. and 
11. O God, prepare the Heartes of y^e ple
to the Lowmyndednes,A Prepa|ratiue. that
mought stand in Meekmyndednes subm
to the Loue, and loue the Coming of thy 
in his Lordlynes: through whom the 
passe of the Earth shall be iudged with
eousnes: which also shall trouble all Mig

iolence, and bring it vnder his Obedience.
nd geeue-ouer or render vnto thee O al|ightie
God; the Kingdom, that thou maist
e all in all.
2. O God geeue this into the Heartes of y^e
Maiestrates for to beholde, and illuminate all
inges, Princes, Lords, and Gouernours / with
y godlie Wisdom, that they mought feare
y holie Name stand submitted to thy Loue
nd her Seruice and so turne them away from
 Violence and Misvse: that the World may
so be inhabited to thy Praise; in the Loue
nd in all Trueth: and that all Men in true
epentaunce for their Sinnes; may be turned
nto thee and the horrible Plagues of y^e Vn|odlines
which are com ouer the World for
er Sinnes cause; ceasse or holde-vp.
. O God, let vs now finde Grace before
ine Eyes, like as the Citie of Niniue in times|ast,
which thou receauedst to mercie: That
ee perish not now all as Sodom and Gomor. For
ur Sinnes are many and aboue measure; be|m
manifolde.
. O Lorde and God O heauenlie Father;
are I beseech thee / the Prayer of the Poore,
nd leade vs in thy Wayes. Gather vs together
on thy Pathes, and make our Heartes agree
 one Band of thy Loue, as One in all, and All
 one / which loue the Right and Righteous|s.
Clense our Mindes from all vngodlie Be|g,
and breake all the Counsaile of Vngodli|es,
to thend that the Wickednes gouerne not
wayes, and euermore.

15. BEhold, my Beloued: This is my frinlie
Exhortatio~ vnto you, that yee wi
submit you vnder the mightie Hande of th
Lorde, and hope vpon his Goodnes: abyding
the Lord-his leasure, and putting your confidence
in Him / according to his Promises.
16. But if the Blaspheamers will not leaue
of fro~ their Blaspheamie, nor take any Counsaile
out of the Woorde and Woorkes of th
Lorde, which are figured-fourth in the Seruic
of Loue / to their Reformation, so will we
then be blameles of their Destruction: for a
much as wee haue figured-fourth y^e Counsail
of the Lorde before them, to their Reformation
and Preseruation, in all our former Seruice
of the Loue, and now in this Exhortatio
heere-after following.
17. The Loue of God the Father throug
the Reuelation of the Coming of our Lord
Iesu Christ; be with you, my Beloued: and illminate
your Spirit, in a true Knowledg of th
Life / in the Spirit, for to see liuinglie with
right Deserning; and to knowe the secre
Counsaile  Will of God, for that yee monug
iudg with a right Iudgment; according
to the Trueth. That graunt vs
the almyghtie Lorde / 
through his Loue.
AMEN.

O Lorde God / Father and Lorde of my Life, let 
not com among the Blaspheamers, and let mee not 
among them.
Eccli. 23.






This is the Reproofe spo|ken
and setfourth b Abia / a Fel|lowe-elder
with HN in the Familie of
Loue / against all seducing pocrites / which go-ourth
against the Familie of Loue / for to seduce the
Single-mynded.

Wher-withall their Falshod / which they to their owne Destrction; sew-fourth against the gra|tious Woorde of the holie Spirit of the Loue
of Iesu Christ, and against Gods elected Mi|nisters
/ as also to their Preseruation in the
Godlines; the Conuertion from their Abhomi|nations
/ is figured-fourth before their Eyes.


The First Chapiter.
_O Yee false Heartes / 
yee Ypocrites / together
with all yee presumpteous
vnsent Teachers / Wherfore
do yee thus trouble and mo|lest
the Littleones / and the
single-minded Elect of God / 
for to withdrawe them with your false and vnclene
Doctrine of the goodthinking Knowledg / from the
Single-mindednes which they haue to the pure
Doctrine of the Seruice of the Loue of Iesu Christ:
and so to leade them away and to estraunge them / 
from the mercifull Grace of our heauenlie Father
from the Safe-making of our Lorde Iesu Christ

and from the Loue of the Holie-gost / whervnto they
haue humblie  obedientlie geeuen-ouer themselues.
2. Woe vnto you and your Presumption / yee
false and seducing Spirites. yee sathanish Houndes
and renting Wolues. yee Generations of Vypers
and Cains Ministers. Yea woe vnto you, yee
Nestes of Dragons and Habitations of Deuels / 
together with all yee wicked Heartes of the Scrip|ture-learned:
For yee and your Fathers haue be|trayed
Gods Propheates as also Iesu Christ
and his Witnesses. hauing falslie accused and de|famed
them: and euenso through the Handes or
Power of Sinners; persecuted and killed them.
3. O Thou wicked Nature / and yee Childre~
of nbeleef / which forsake the Purging
in Iesu Christ / through the Beleef / and the vpright
Beeing of the Loue of Iesu Christ, and expell the|same
out of your Heartes / together with the Ac|complishing
of the true Oblation or Godseruice in
the Holie / to the Slaying and Burying of your
Sinnes / and to the Renewing of your Spirit and
Minde: Is it not Wickednes and Euel-fact e|nough
for you / that yee haue turned-away your|selues
from the Requiring of y^e Loue and her Ser|uice
/ and from the faithfull Sheepe or Children of
thesame made your Portion with the Goates pol|luted
yourselues in all Vnbeleef / contrarie to the
Safe-making of our Lorde Iesus Christ and his
holie Spirit of Loue prepared you to Vessels of
the Wrath of God and with your false Iudg|mentes
and Blaspheaming of the Holie-gost; pluc|ked
vpon your owne Neckes / the dreedfull Iudg|ment
and wrathfull Woord of the Lorde [Depart

from mee / yee Curssed, into the euerlasting
Fire / which is prepared for the Deuell and his
Angels or Messengers] But that yee must also
with your false Doctrine and vncleane Lippes;
pursue and persecute the Elect the faithfull Childre~
of the Loue of Iesu Christ, for to robbe them of
their Inheritaunce of the Kingdom of God and of
the Loue of Christ, to holde them captiue in your
damnable Beeing or Estate / and that yee mought
make them partakers with you and all wicked Spi|rites
if it were possible that yee could seduce them;
of your Damnation.
4. For verelie / till vnto thesame Iudgment of
this your Condemnation / yee are O yee Children
of the Deuell / and Members of Antichrist; helde
bound with the Bandes or Chaines of Darknes / 
to thende that the God of Heauen should in this
Daye of his righteous Iudgment; make-manifest
and bring his Vengeaunce ouer you / to your Re|compencing
with the Fire of Hell.
5. Yea / euen-thus will the God of Heauen pre|sentlie
in this Day / openlie bring-fourth and make-knowne
before your Eyes / and before all Eyes of
Vnderstanding; the Hardnes of your Heartes / 
with your Lyes  Blaspheaminges of God / which
yee haue spoken against God the Father and his
mercifull Grace and against Christ and his Righ|teous-making
from the Sinne as also against the
holie Spirit and his Making-aliue in the Loue.
6. Euen-thus will presentlie in this Day of the
righteous Iudgment of God O yee presumpteous
Blaspheamers of the Holie-gost and his Familie
of Loue; all the Woe of the Vngodlie com ouer

you / to your Rewarding.
7. FOr-that-cause looke now into your Abho|minations
/ and marke how yee haue sepe|rated
yourselues with y^e Goates / from the Sheep / 
with the which yee shall also (if so be that yee do not
whollie turne you away therfrom / and repent) be
constrained to beare your Sentence of Condemna|tion.
Therfore looke now rightlie into it / and re|pent
/ ereuer the Vengeaunce of God fall vpon you.
Yea looke well into it / how yee haue madevp your|selues
with your false Iudgmentes / against God-his
righteous Iudgment / and against the holie
Spirit of the Loue of Iesu Christ, and his Com|munialtie
of Holyones: In such wise / that yee haue
also indeuoured you / to seduce God-his elected Ho|lyones
/ and to make the gratious Woorde which
God hath raised-vp by vs / according to his Pro|mises;
and the Ministers of thesame Woord / hor|rible
and despised / before all Goodwillingones to
the Righteousnes: and so then to pluck them away
from the Communialtie of Loue / and to leade them
with you in your Chaines or Bandes of Darknes;
nto Damnation / to thentent that they should not
by any-meanes be taught through the Obedience
of the Seruice of Loue; to the Kingdom of Heauen / 
which yee shuttoo before Many / and com not ther|in
yourselues but that they should remaine with
you / ther-without.
8. Yea euen-thus / with your Falshod and for|ged
Lyes / and with your subtile Slaunders and
flattering Woordes / yee com-fourth so knowledg|full
/ and occupie also according to the Similitude
or Figuring-fourth of the Scriptures; such a co|loured

Shew of Christianitie / for to leade-astraye / 
that yee should if it were possible; seduce also the
Elect / with your false or coloured Christianitie.
9. But no: Yee are not able in this Daye of
Loue / to seduce the Elect / nor to accomplish your
Seduction, with the Holyones of God of the Fa|milie
of Loue: For y^e liuing God of Heauen which
s their God and their Defender from all Seduc|tion;
goeth so stedfaslie in his Seruice of Loue;
with his true Light of the heauenlie Cleernes of Ie|su
Christ / before them all which are his faithfull
Childre~ of Loue / and geeueth them daylie through
his holie and gratious Woord; such a cleere Di|uersitie
in their Heartes: and the true Light of all
the Righteous and Holyones of God / is so naked|ie
distincted vnto them / from the Darknesses of the
alse Light of all y^e Vnrighteous / and false Heartes
of the Scripture-learned or of the vnsent Prach|rs / 
That it is not possible that yee should seduce
hem (if they holde them constantlie on the Ser|ice
of Loue) from the Waye of the Loue of Iesu
Christ: nether-yet that yee should be able yee wic|ed
Generations of Cain, and yee false Prophetes
of Iezabel; to destroy or keep-back in them / Gods
Trueth and Righteousnes.
0. Verelie our Lorde and Sauiour / Iesus
Christ, hath well and rightlie spoken and prophe|ied
of your subtile Falshod and decitfull Signes
and Wonders for to leade-astray: In such wise / 
hat the Elect should also if it were possible; th|ough
your subtile Falshod and loftie Knowledg / 
elead into Errour.
1. But for the Elects-sake / the Dayes are now

hortened: For God will presentlie in this Day 
his Loue in y^e which Hee will keep his Iudgment
execute his righteous Iudgment: and will euen
glorifie his Elect / in his Righteousnes or Perfection / 
and make them ioyfull with his euerlastin
Lie; in his Kingdom of Heauens: as also mak
manifest all false Deuices which are practied for 
leade-astray: and condemne you / with the Vngodlie
and Blaspheamers of the holie Spirit of Loue
and with all Children of the Deuell / in the Hel
where-as in the beholding of their Vngodlynes
all Woe / Wringing-of-handes / and Gnashing 
Teeth shall take-holde of them / euerlastinglie.
12. FOr-that-cause ought eueryone to look
well to it / what hee iudgeth for euell an
blaspheameth: and to haue a good regarde on th
Matiers which concerne God or his Seruice / fo
to vnderstand those-same first well and aright / according
to the Trueth / ereuer hee iudg them for euell / 
and slaunder or despise them. For it will con
very heauelie vpon them / which stretch-out the
Handes to Gods Sanctuarie / for to take-holde 
thesame with vncleane Handes / and to resist an
blaspheame with vncleane Heartes / and with vncircumcised
Tunges and Lippes; Gods Work
with his Holyones or Children of Loue.


The Second Chapiter.
OH alas; how many-maner 
false heartes are ther now! which do 
eueryone with hys craftie Knowledg
makeup themselues against God and 

Seruice of Loue / and are not ashamed to spew|urth
their horrible Lyes  Blaspheamies against
Gods gratious Woord and his Seruice of Loue.
. And then cometh fourth the one Partie from
he one syde and the other Partie from the other
yde / vnto the Goodwilling to the Loue of Iesu
Christ, and saye vnto them: Yea as I heare / yee
ade also the Bookes of the Familie of Loue / which
re setfourth by HN: Hee writeth verelie; many
xcellent Matiers / wherin hee resiteth much of the
Loue / and teacheth Men ther-withall; to the vp|ight
Beeing of Christ:
But what is that to the purpose: Ther lyeth
reat Falshod hidden ther-vnder: wee knowe what
ee haue found-out by thesame. Therfore take yee
eed therof / and looke well to it / that yee be not se|uced
therwith nor drawen to y^e Familie of Loue.
 warne you of the horrible Seduction / and of the
rronious Bookes of HN: to thend that yee be not
lucked with the Familie of Loue / into horrible Er|urs.
And so they do then spew-fourth many for|ed
Lyes / and beaslie Matiers / wherwith they do
cuse and defame the Familie of Loue as also HN
nd the Elders which minister the holie and graci|s
Woorde / in the Familie of Loue / for to make
enso with their false Defamations / the Familie
 Loue / wherin God liueth and walketh together
ith HN God-his elected Minister and the El|ers
in the Familie of Loue / horrible and despised
fore all People.
. Beholde / such venemous Foode of Death
ontrary to the wholsom Foode of Life and of the
rueth of God; can the Deuell prepare / through

his Ministers and Ministrices / and through 
false Heartes of the Scripture-learned / and 
Ministers of the false Godseruices of Cain: 
they knowe then how to couer thesame Falsho
vnder a Shew of Holynes and of Loue which th
beare vnto Men / to thend that they should not fa
to fulfill the Measure of the Iniquitie of their Fthers / 
and that the Dayes which reach to the
Condemnation / mought be shortened.
5. WOe vnto you / yee false Heartes: 
presentlie in thys Daye shall all yo
Lyes and forged false Testimonies which yee yo
selues haue made very filthie / with your vnclea
Dirt; be condemned in the hellish Fire: For thsame
your false Testimonies are brought-four
out of the earthlie Ingeniousnes and Generat
of the Deuell: and yee haue exalted yourselues 
your earthlie Ingeniousnes; so hie / with thesam
and with the Workes of the Fleash / to a great Etimation
with Men / and planted your false Se
so fast in the Heartes of Men / that yee haue vtte
lie expeiled ther-out the God of Life / the safe-maki
Christ, and the Holy-gost of the heritable Rich
of the houenlie Bewtie also lead many men 
vnto Desruction and brought many ino gre
Heauynes and greeuous Miscrie: and haue eue
so ther-through / prepared the Iudgment of yo
Condemnation / the-sooner ouer yourselues.
6. Therfore shall also presentle through 
your Fall; many vpright Heartes be able ligh
to perceaue / that yee are thesame Messengers of 
Deuell / which are gon-fourth against God and 
Seruice of Loue / and against his Trueth / for

seduce with your vncleane Dirt and painted Ho|lynes;
the simple Heartes / fro~ the Familie of Loue
like-as yee haue don vnto many other ignorant
Men / which walke without the Howse and Ser|uice
of Loue; and to pluck them into your Snares.
But verelie it shall not auaile you in this Daye of
Loue / by the Faithfulones of the Familie of Loue / 
to spread-abrode your seducing Seedes any far|der.
For your false Practises and your Fall / are
now well perceaued of the vpright Heartes.
7. Yea consider well theron O yee goodwilling
Heartes to the Righteousnes; how slylie these
Messengers of the Deuell com vnto you. this
Broode of Lucifer. these Resisters of the Trueth / 
as Iannes and Iambres. these false Ministers of
the Priestes-office / as Nadab and Abihu. these
Seditious-persons / as the Company of Chore.
and these vnsent bloud-thirstie Preachers / as the
Priestes of Iezabel: Consider (I saye) aduisedlie
theron / how subtillie they shew-fourth themselues / 
and can paint their false Nature / with an Angels-colour / 
to thentent that one should not perceaue the
Falshod of their wicked Heartes and the Lustes
and Desires of their Whordom and Adulterie / 
wherof their Eyes and Heartes are full: and that
hey mought euenso vnder a coloured Couering / 
loke their Vncleannes of Whordom and Adulte|ie / 
together with their abhominable Idolatrie and
alse Godseruices as also lay those-same their Ab|ominations
and Vncleannes / vpon the Neckes
f the Single-mynded and Good-willingones to
he Loue of Iesu Christ, or report such-thinges of
hem and so accuse and defame them therwithall.

8. BEholde / yee that haue Eyes for to per|ceaue
/ such false Heartes and contentious
Deuels-messengers / which seeke not the Peace o
Christ nor the Concorde in the Loue. but bring-i
all Renting and Dissention or Breach / are driuen-fourth
by the false Spirit of Antichrist, and by th
lying Ingeniousnes of the Fleash / for to practise al
Deceit and Falshod / according to the Workes 
the Deuell / and also to seduce the simple single-minded
Heartes / like-as they do the Vnfaithfull and
Waueringones in the Beleef / vnto their Errour.
9. And if then the Deuell cannot accomplish o
bring thesame to-passe at full; through his Belialish
Men / so bringeth hee thesame also into th
Handes of the false Women / which are inclined t
such wicked Workes / and haue cratie Subtiltie
to accomplish the false Deuices of the Deuell.
10. Euen-thus verelie / do they all deale wit
Deceit and Falshod / which go-out from the wicke
World: and also all those which hue geeuen the
thervnto. And so doth eueryone of them diligentli
applye him / to sowe euery-where his Mischeef an
contentious Seedes. and to spew-fourth all Blaspheamie / 
against God and his Familie of Loue.


The Third Chapiter.
Hy on you / yee whorish Generations
and adulterous Children of the vncleane
and defiled Bed: How are yee thu
seeing that yee yourselues are so vnclen
growen to such Presumption! that yee com vn
the Elect of God and Children of Loue / and 

vpon you as also indeuour you / for to mingle your
Vncleannes of the Hedghogs-filthines and Swi|nes-dung / 
among our pure and heauenlie Foode / 
or to bring it in besides thesame / and to feede our
sweet-hearted Children of the Loue ther-withall / 
like as yee haue don / towardes the Vnfaithfull and
vnto many Worldlie-mynded. Phy / phy on the
stincking Dirt of your Vncleannes.
2. Verelie / like as the Dirt of your Vncleannes
s a filthie Stinck before God / euenso is it also a fil|thie
Stinck in our Noses.
3. And although yee garnish thesame your stinc|ing
Dirt when as yee bring thesame vnto vs;
with Roses and Lillies / and with many-maner of
aire Flowers / and strew it ouer with Rosemary|eaues
and Cinamon / yet doth neuerthelesse the
Sunne of Righteousnes with his bright  whot
Shyning; make the Stinck of thesame / manifest
efore vs. Yea so manifest / that all those that haue
ynded the Loue and her Seruice / with vpright
nd faithfull Heartes / and shewe all Obedience
owardes thesame / haue a great Lothsomnes of the
Stinck of thesame Dirt.
. For the holie and gratious Woord of God / 
hich is heald-fourth before vs in liuing Power
through the holie Spirit of y^e Loue of Iesu Christ,
nd through God-his elected Minister HN; in the
Seruice of Loue / and which is as the true Bread
f Life / that is com vnto vs from Heauen; admini|red
to a liuing Foode of our Soules / is so reue|nd
and so godlie for vs to heare and to feed-of / 
d wee haue also turned our Lust and Loue so
hollie thervnto / that wee abhor and haue a great

Lothsomnes / to heare of any-thing els. Yea and
much-more a Lothsomnes / to receaue or inioy any|thing
of any straunge Spirites / or of anyone which
is a Straunger vnto the Familie of Loue.

out of the Familie of Loue / nor haue not
Gods Woorde nor Spirit / in liuing Power by
you. but onlie the Imaginatio~ of your Knowledg / 
or the dead Letter / which all false Heartes of the

So bide then hardelie with your garnished
Dirt / by yourselues: For heere by the Faithfull
and Electedones in the Familie of Loue / it is al-to-well
knowne.
6. But if yee desire to repent / and to com by vs
in Sorrowfulnes or your Sinnes / for to be con|uerted
and made-sae from all your Abhominati|ons
and taught and instructed aright / in the Way
of the Trueth of Iesu Christ: and so then to liue
vprightlie in all Trueth of God and Christ: So
forsake it then all that yee haue taken to you / with|out
the gratious Woorde of God and the Requi|ring
of his Seruice of Loue / and seperate you whol|lie
therfrom: and assemble you than euenso to our
Communialtie of Sainctes / to Vnitie of Heart in
the Loue / so shall yee then be receaued of vs with

vnder the Obedience of the Loue and her Seruice
be wasshed and cleansed from all your Sinnes / 
with the holie and pure Waters of the holie Spirit
of Loue: and be than taught with the pure Doctrine
of y^e holie and gratious Woord / to the Kingdom
of the God of Heauens / and nourrished-vp 

ncient Elders and Fathers of the Failie of
oue; in the holie and godlie Vnderstanding / to
end that yee mought knowe and obserue / all that
hich pleaseth God / and is resonable and edifying
ith Men also confesse and publish-fourth the safe-aking
Beleef of Christ and his vpright Fruites
 Righteousnes and out of thesame Treasure of
ur Heartes rightlie bring-fourth out of the true
oue o Iesu Christ; the New and the Olde / to a

FOr-that-cause according to the Counsaile
of the holie Scripture; becom yee No

t of the Water and out of the Holie-got: and
 then as new-borne Children; the pure vncor|pted

hen-as yee are entred into the Begining of the

Thus haue a good and right regarde vnto

nd to Goodwillingnes to the vpright Righteous|s:
and indeuour you not first / to pluck-out the
pliner out of anothers Eye / ereuer yee haue plu+d
the Beame out of your owne Eye. Nether-yet
plye you also to be a Teacher / so long as the
octrine to the Kingdom of Heauen / is yeat need|ll
for yourselues.

9. Applye you not also to liue / nether-yet 
shew or witnes the Life vnto another / ereuer th

10. Likewise take not vpon you / to euangeli
the Euangelie of the Kingdom vnto anyman / ecept
that yee haue in the Obedience of the Requring
of the Loue / receaued the Kingdom of Heaue

with your Eares and handled or felt it in the v

But ground and stablish you on the euerlast|g

THus let eueryone looke well to it / and

Take it effectuallie to heart.
