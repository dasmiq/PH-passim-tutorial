 A Farewell cauld, Churcheyeards, rounde. From the Courte to the Cuntry grownd.

_IN Courte yf Largies be
why parte I thens so bare
yf Lords were franke  fre
Su~ dradg wold Lordings spare
To hyme whose tonge and penn
Myght showe in euery coste
The worthynes of men,
And who desaruythe moste.


Full lyttill maye be gott
Where hungry droppes do falle
Where all goes to the pott
The kitchine fese ar smalle
The Byrde can spare no plumes
That fethers gaye wolde haue
The Courttyer all consumes
who makes hyme selfe so braue


No no here lyes in dede
The padde within the strawe
For eche man pledithe neade
And he is held a dawe,
That gyues to suche as wante
And thynkes hyme selfe in lacke
This makes the world so skant
And tournythe all to wracke.


For fryndshype cowlde as Ise
I wayted longe and late
And gladde to playe the vice
To plesure eche estate
And euer dyd I hope
To hitt my wysshyd marke
yet lo I dyd but grope
For gnats within the darke


Parhappes the froste hathe nypt
Eache Noble lyberall hand
Or ellse a waye is skypte
In to sume other lannde
God send a thawe a gayne
And shyppes drawe home as fast
That pore men for ther payne
Maye fynde sume welthe at last


I saught the Prynce to sarue
As all oure dutyes is
And hope I dyd desarue
A greter sute then this,
But dayes and wekes are spente
And worne my cotes full thyne
And all my yearly rent
yet founde no grace therein.


No Monstoure sure I am
Nor fowlle deformyd thynge,
No shepe nor suckinge lame
More lycke to sarue a Kinge,
As shall bothe hand and harte
At lengthe my wytnes be,
When proffe in any parte
Shall be requyrde of me.


Had I but founde a wyght
In Courte when I was there,
The Lady Sydney hight
All changed had byn this gere,
what happ had I to shue
Where no suche helpe is founde,
O dames yt blushe not you
Thought she in grace a bound,


Nowe from the Courte to carte
My horse and I muste pase,
Who hathe the meryst harte
Who is in better case
My horse or I, God knowes,
The one muste beare his charge
The other where he goes
Must pourely lyue at large.

Finis.
quod, T. Churcheyeard.
