conflyct and in shedyng of blood / and all this
was onely to support his eyerable lyfe (vsur|ped
power / dygnyte emperyall /  regall / which
nothing lesse pertayned to the church of Rome / 
as playnly apperyth in this lytle boke / abbrey|ated

with generall councelles and so most gen|yll

The fyrste parte and dyffe|rence
of this boke.
_FFyrst ye shall vnderstan+de
howe the churche of Rome / 
was fyrst infecte with treasure
and possessyons. As fyrst by the
Emperour Constantyne / the great and
his successours? Pepyne / Charlemayn / 
lowys de bonere. And by dyuers other
prynces. Howe be it it was ingendred / 
gadred / vnder the shadowe of polecy,
throughe fayned holynesse. Wherof
sprang great infexions, and therby was
ingended many wycked chyldren / as
Pryde, Pompe, Arrogansy, Herisy, Auc+toryte
of Kynges, and Prynces, suppres+synge
subiectes with great tyranny / w^t|out
mercy, shame or pety, after y^ whiche
thynges there folowed great abusyons
and debates, in cou~ceylles generalles.
And thus of all these foresayd iniquites
engendred great sysmes and diuysions,
seperacyons,  impedymentes, w^t percy|alytes,
amonge chrysten Regyons wher+of

sprange great euylles, trybulacyons
inco~uenyences, persecutyons, through
all chryste~dom. And thus through these
enormytes, and Inco~uenyences, it was
expedyent for dyuerse Kyng,  Prync
to assemble dyuerse councelles and con|gregacyons
of wyse  prudent persons,
and faythfull chrysten Rulers, and go|uerners,
the which counceles doth more
playnly appere in the fyrst parte of this
present boke and specyally in the .vii.
fyrste sysmes.


Of the fyrst sysme  deuysyon / that
began in the churche of Rome, with
persecucyons and deuysyons, that
arose through the possessyons that
constantyne the emperour gaue
to the Bysshop of Rome Syl|uester
and his successours.
_IT is a comune experience / 
dayle sene and harde / that
none euyll is engendred but
through some euyll and ma|lyuolent
persone / as it appered playnly

by one Nouatus an heritike preest  car+dynall
of Rome / which was y^ fyrst y^e in|uiolated
y^e church of Rome through his
detestable abusio~s  ypocrysy for he pre+te~ded
none other / but to obtayne y^ dig|nyte
of the see of rome vnder his fayned
holynesse / that was throughe Rygore,
and ambysyon. Thus vnder his false 
subtyll pretence was reysed vp two an|ty
papis agaynst the holy bysshop saynt
Cornelis / the one was y^ sayd Nouaus
at rome: the other nicostratus in affrica / 
and so was expulsed the said Nouatus,
frome y^ knowlege of the churche of Ro|me
/  named hym selfe (vnmaculat cle|ne
without spot) and al his diciples and
thus they a bode in theyr appostasy / as
men that denyed the fayth catholyke / 
not worthy to come agayne to the cryste~
Relygyon accordyng as Chrystes dycy|ples
dyd preach and teache the Gospell.
For the whiche errour it was thought
expedyent to assemble a counsell in Ro|me
of .40. Bysshoppes, In the whiche

cou~ceyl the sayd Nouatus was co~demp+ned / which
was the fyrst counceyll that
was assembled in the church of Rome / 
except in the prymatyue churche by the
Appostles, and Discyples, of Chryste.
Thus abode Cornelis a Romayn in y^
see bysshop suffryng great tribulacions
and persecucyons / through the sysmes
of the two forsayd antypapes / nuatus
and Nycostratus cardynalles / and per|forse
put Cornelius to exyle /  so after|warde
he was put to y^ Crowne of mar|terdome
vnder the tyraunt Decyus em+perour
 he rayned bysshop of Rome .ii.
yeres and .iii. dayes and so he gaue his
power and auctoryte to steuen and thus
the see of Rome lyued many yeres after
Chrystes passyon in great perfeccyon / 
symplycie  holynesse replet with grace
and vertue / vntyll the tyme that Co~sta~|tyne
poysoned holy perfeccion w^t tempo+rall
possessyons / whiche he gaue then to
the church of Rome and so rayned after
Cornelius / Fabyan the fyrst the .xxi. bis+shop

of Rome / whiche cristened Phillip
the fyrst Emperour of y^ name of y^e nacio~
of Arabye / who began to raygne Anno
dn~i .cc.xlvi. which when he dyed gaue al
his treasours,  possessyons, vnto y^e sayd
Fabyan bysshop of Rome / the whiche
Emperour dyed vnder Decius the Ty|raunt
/ and so bycause that Decius the
tyraunt coude not obtayne Kyng Phyl|lyppes,
treasours whiche was gyuen to
Fabyan bysshop of Rome. Then De|cyus
caused great persecucyon through
all the worlde amonge crysten people,
whiche was y^e .vii. persecucion after Ne+ro
the great tiraunt  so in this persecu|cyon
Fabyan was put to deth by cruell
martyrdome with the fyrst and the .xxi.
martyre bysshop of Rome / folowynge
Saynt Peter / and vnder y^ sayd decyus
dyed martyrs, Sebastian, saynt Aga|tha,
Appolonia with many other y^e were
innocent of the treasours that fabyane,
had whiche was y^ specyall cause of this
cruell persecucyon of chrystes flocke.

And so this cruell tyranny contynew+ed
many yeres by detyns and his succes|sours
/ and so after Detyns successid Ua+leryan
gallus which began the .viii. per+secucion / 
vnder whom dyed Sextus bis+hop
of rome the fyrst of that name (also)
Laurens his deacon which distrybuted
the goodes of the church to the pore ac|cordyng
to y^ law of God also saynt Ypo+lyt
with dyuers other martyrs dyed vn+der
hym. And after hym Aurclianus em+perour
borne i~ Dalmace, the .xxxii. empe+rour
founder of Orleaunce in Fraunce.
And y^ cytie of Geneue vpon the lake in
sauoy / he persecuted the .ix. persecucion
on Christes flocke or region through cri+stendom
to pytefull to suffer.
THe .x. persecucion was most cruely
vsed through Dioclesian  Maxi|myan
Emperours borne in Dalmatiq~
whiche persecucyon endured .x. yeres,
whiche Dioclesyan caused hym selfe to
be honoured lyke a God in kyssyng his
fete as popis of late daies hath vse prin+ces

and crysten rulers to do which was
abhomynable afore God,  man, and
this sayd Dioclesian persecuted ouer al
the Orientall partes of y^e world  Max|imian
in lykewyse in y^ occident partes / 
and tyranny vpon chrystes chosen chyl|dren
was so horryble  vnmerciful lyke
bochers of bestes / that it was to exece|ble
in the syght of all people / impossyble
for pen to wryt for in the space of a mo|neth
in y^ pat of Engla~d  Frau~ce was
put to deth .xvii. thousa~d christe~ people / 
in so moch that y^ fayth of chryst was al|most
in Englande and frau~ce extynckit
that no man durst shew hym felfe a cry|sten
man for fere of deth and tyranny / 
all bokes of Chrystes fayth brent that
myght be goten / so after this cruell per|secucyons
the deuyll ennemye to al ma~|kynd
engendred many heresyes as Sa+bellyans
that denyed y^t Ihesus Chryste
was not the sone of God and also y^e he|rytykes
called Manekis put forth two
questyons / one good y^ other euyl / wher+vpon

was gadred a great counceyll in
Antioch agaynst Paule the samosetha~
bysshop which denyed the virginite of
the virgyne Mary mother of chryste.
In the whiche counceyll and busynesse
was assembled .xviii. bysshoppes in the
cyte of senesse in the countrey of naples.
All this persecucyon endured vnto y^
tyme of Constantyne y^ great emperour
in which tyme was martyred and put to
deth for Christes fayth all these sayntes
Marcellyn, Marcell, Melchiades, bys|shops
of Rome, Also Agnes, Anastase,
Barbara, Crispyn, and Crispian, Cry|stofer,
Cosme, and Damyan, Kateryne,
Luce, marget, George, maximilia~, quin+tyn,
Blase, Mauryce, Uincent,  many
without nombre whose names are wry+ten
in the boke of lyfe.


Here foloweth the occasyon of the
sismes and enormytyes that came
of the donacyon and gyftes of
Constantyne to the
churche of Rome.

_THus haue you harde howe
the fylthy treasours y^ Faby|an
helde Chrystes churche / 
was infected fyrste with by
the couetous mynde of Fabyan bysshop
of Rome / whiche held the treasours of
Phyllyp kynge whiche dyed vnder De|cyus
the tyraunt / whiche Decyus cruel+ly
persecuted all crystendome for with
holdynge the sayd tresory of kyng Phyl+lyp / 
and so afterward the forsayd No|atus
 Nycostratus was proued false
prophetes  antipapes openly to theyr
great rebukes and shame by a generall
counceyll / and yet after this there ose
agayne throughe all Chrystes churche
great dyscordes / trybulatyo~s /  persecu+cyo~s
through the infexions / pryd  of ar+rogansy / 
y^e arose in the church of Rome
through the treasours and gyftes of co~|stantyne
and of his successours / where
through sprange .xxiii. great sysmes in
contynuaunce i~ crystes church through
these possessyons temporall abused.



Of constancius father
of constantyne.
_COnstantyne was sone to the
doughter of claude. Empe|rour
the seconde of his name,
and the said Constancius ma+ryed
Helene quene of Englande herefor
to the Crowne of Englande / by whom
was conceyued and borne constantyne / 
the great / the yere of oure Lorde God .ccc.viii.
whiche Constantyne was empe+rour
of all the occident partes and after
warde emperour of all the worlde.
And thus after his great warres Cy|uyle
he beynge yet a pagan  a persecu|tor
of crysten men / as his predecessours
were / frome the whiche tyranny God of
his wonderfull workes conuerted hym
to y^e faith by Siluester byshop of Rome
which was fled  hyd hym selfe for dred
of deth in mountens and woodes.



Of Siluestre the fyrst which tryum|phed
ouer the churche mylytat of
Rome / through great possessyon 
treasours whiche the emprou
Constantyne enpoysoned 
churche fyrste withall.
_SIluester the .xxxiiii. byshp
borne i~ Rome, was estemed
a ma~ of holy lyfe which had
great grace gyue~ to hym in
co~uertyng many to the fayth, as specyla+ly
constantyne the great / by whose dyly|gence
and preachyng the sayd syluester
caused hym to sease of his cruell tyra~ny
vpon cristen people / co~maunding  de|stroy
all ydoles temples / and set vp Cry+stes
churches /  so worshipped the crosse
and passyon of cryst ouer all the worlde
vnyuersall / to the great ioy of all cryste~+dome
and straytly he co~mau~ded that no
persecucion shulde be done ouer crysten
men in no regyon / which was to al cry|stendome
a wonderful sd ayne mutacy+on

and chaunge y^ in a lytle whyle afore
y^e no man so hardy y^e durst be knowen to
be a crysten man for feare of persecucyo~
of deth / in somoch they were hated ouer
all / that no body wold suffre a cryste~ ma~
(ones knowe~) abyd i~ no place but lyued
in great dred and in secret places.
Thus by the prouysyon of God syl|uestre
was taken in lyke honour w^t kyn+ges
whiche was as many haue opinion
and say it was by the subtyl craft of the
deuyll / whiche is  euer was the auncy|aunt
ennemy of mankynd which could
fynde none other poyson to destroy the
perfexion of holy byshops / which were
xxxii. that dyed holy martyrs for crystes
fayth afore Syluester /  thus y^ deuyll
supposynge to haue a great parte of cry+stendome / through
riches, power, digni|te,
pryd, and heresy, and sismes, y^e shulde
sprynge /  dyd in dede afterward / vnto
this day experience leadeth vs to moche
And some holdeth opynyon,  wryteth
that at this tryumphe was herd a voyce

horryble in the ayer sayenge / Hodie ve|nenum
i~ ecclesia semiau, yet I can not
assure this for a trewth but as some wri|ters
haue wryten.
This noble Prynce Constantyne in
loue  zelus mynde to siluester / through
the wonderfull suffraunce of God / and
blynded with worldly vanytes, caused
Siluester the bisshop to be clothed with
purple sylkes  rayment imperyal most
lyke a Kynge or a Prynce in somoch he
toke his crowne imperiall  set it on his
hede / yet notwithsta~dyng Siluester w^t 
humble cou~tenaunce wolde not take it,
but vtterly refused it  wold not vse nor
take vpon hym to were it / but a symple
myter of fustian / the whiche is yet vsed
among the bysshops and cardinalles of
Rome to this daye / notwithstandynge
though Siluester wolde not take vpon
hym the emperyall Crowne yet the bys|shops
of Rome of late dayes haue take~
vpon them vsurpacyon  hye auctoryte
thre crownes of golde facyoned hye and

sharpe copped, ryche w^t stones and perle
as the boxe of a great lapydarye oryen|tal
for truely it is to be wo~dered on such
superfluyte to be worne on any such ho|ly
persones / hede for Chryst our redemp+tour
vsed no such vayne glory / for i~ this
cause Platyne y^ great wryter of stores
mayster of the roulles in Rome / whcihe
mocketh this abusyo~ in y^ tyme of Adria~
y^ fyrst which was called paule y^ proude
a venecyan / which gloryfyd i~ hym selfe
in suche lyke ryche apparel eue~ as a god
in earth (and wolde so be called) among
people in earth i~ his arrogancy  pryde
and thus wolde y^ sayde Paule vse hym
selfe gloryfyed euery yere of Iubely / 
afore all y^ worlde  afore y^ Pylgrymes
 dyd vse hym to were y^ maner  facion
rayment / of women in those dayes lyke
the customable weryng that Bysshops
dyd vse, and yet moreouer saynt Austyn
sayeth de verbis domini / in reproche of
the arrogancy  pryde of popes / whiche
wolde be called Goddes saynge thus.

(Qui vult videre deus cum sit homo
non imitatur illum qui cu~ deus esset pro
illo factus est homo.)
Thus to proced of Siluester though
he with holy and symple countenaunce
refused the ryche crowne emperyall of
Constantyne / yet he wolde not refuse of
Constantyne y^e great possessyon gyftes
and rentes y^ he gaue with the hole cytie
of rome, which was no small possessyon
as dyuers wryters maketh mencyon, as
doth Laurence valla the great orator.
This Syluester caused to assemble
the fyrste great generall councell at Ny+cene
and Bythena purposly agaynst the
herysies of Aryen which greatly en+creased,
whose errours was in
the distynctions of the thre
persons in Trinite. And
in this cou~ceyl was
prese~t .xxxviii.
Bysshop|pes
assembled,



Of the seconde scisme and dyuysion
that was in y^ church of rome, short|ly
after the donacion of Co~stanty|ne.
And of the herysies that
fell in this tyme by the
fyrst pope heretykes,
 shamefull sys|matykes.

_AFter the donacyon of Con|sta~tine
folowed two bisshop+pes
of Rome pesyble  iuste
men in theyr offyce without
sysme or dyscorde amonge
crystes flocke / the one was named Mar+ke,
the other Iuly. In whose tyme y^ he|resyes
of the Aryans encreased more 
more, whiche torned the hart and mynde
of Constance the sone of Constantyne y^
then rayned. And so he began the .xi. per+secucyon
vpon crysten people. And put
Iulius in exyle out of rome, whose pla|ce
succeded Liberius, and Felyce togy|ther,

which enuyed ech other, who shuld
haue the see of Rome, so in contynuau~ce
Liberius y^ heretyke throughe the fauor
of Constans opteyned his purpose to be
bysshop of Rome, And enioyed the see of
Rome, the space of .xlii. yeres and .vii.
monthes and thre dayes / notwithstan|dyng
he was noted to be the fyrste pope
heretyke and sysmatyke. And supporter
of the Aryans artycles, through his ab+homynable
gloryous dygnyte pleasyng
the mynde of the Emperoure Constan|tyne
the yonger infecte with the sayd he+resyes
/ whiche was the most abhomyna+blest
and cruel heresyes y^ euer was, wor+se
then the seckte of Maho~met / for the
Preestes Aryans persecuted other cry|sten
bysshops  catholyke people with|out
pety, or mercy, in Affryque  Spay|ne.
Thus was Felyxe y^ bysshop of Ro|me
put to deth i~ this persecucio~ / the .xiiii
moneth of his reygne /  after this rose
other heresyes called Donastytes whi|che
baptysed y^ criste~ agayne / as our late

Anna baptystes vsed and as the enmo|nyans
heretyk y^e sayd that Iesu Cryste
in his Godhede was not equall w^t God
the Father by dyuyne nature / but onely
by grace /  the massedonyas heretykes / 
denyed the holy Ghost to be equall with
the Father, and the Sone,  thus these
heresyes arose y^ .xii. persecucyo~ through
the co~maundement of Iulian y^ apposta+ta
emperour that was fyrst a criste~ man
and after fell to Ydolatry / whiche perse|cucyon
arose by euyll example  sismes / 
that he sawe in Chrystes church.


Here foloweth y^e .iii. sisme of y^e church
of Rome in whiche tyme Rome
was destroyed by y^e gootes.
_SHortly after the seconde sys|me
y^e thyrde folowed / bytwe~
Bysshop Damascus borne
in Spayne and Ursysinus
cardynall  deacon his ennemy / whiche
was his open chalenger / to batayll in
armes within the church wherthrough / 

were many men slayne one both partes,
so inconclusyon Damascus ouercame
and vaynqueshed vrsysyne y^ antipape / 
whiche was afterward content with the
bysshoprycke of naples.
Thus is apparant to all the worlde / 
what desolacyon and myschefe ensued
vpon the possessions that was gyuen to
the bysshops ofRome by Co~stantyne 
his successours what w^t violence of war
 persecucyon of tyranny vpon crysten
people, alas what pety was this to se y^e
see of Rome so pyteously brought i~ such
a name by Damascus bysshop /  this
man was y^ fyrst bysshop of Rome that
enterpressed dedes of armes  warre for
his dignyte / yet notwithstandyng he is
at this day acepted and taken for a holy
glorious confessou / yet was he accused
for adultrye and this man was the fyrst
that auctorysed saynt Ieromes werkes
and in his tyme Rome was taken / and
destroyed by Alarych Kynge of gootes
the whiche ingendred great slaunder in

the crysten church in somoch that y^ pay|nymes
greatly reproched the chrysten re+lygyon
for suche shamfull enormytes in
somoche that many cristen Kynges and
Prynces withdrewe the~ frome seruinge
of God / and so fell frome y^ fayth where
vpon saynt Austen compiled and wrote
the boke called (De ciuitate dei)  thus
through this sysme the deuyll redy to al
myschefe engendred another sorte of he|retykes
called Pelagyans / whose opy|nyons
was that ma~ myght meryt with|out
the grace and gyft of God / and that
no ma~ shuld passe vpo~ baptyme / for the
whiche errour was assembled a cou~ceyl
generall in the cetye of Carage  there
were asse~ble .cc.xviii. prelates where, as
saynt Austen was one of them  sheued
wel his scyence vertue and learnynge.


Of the .iiii. sisme /  tribulacions befel
in christ church /  of y^ great coun|ceylles
agaynst y^ great heresyes
that then raygned whiche co~+tynewed
fyfte yeres.

THus bytwene the thyrde sysme  y^
fourthe was but foure pesyble bys+shoppes
of Rome, whiche were Syry|ake
Anastase fyrst, Innoce~t y^ fyrst /  zo|synus
after whose death began the .iiii.
sysme  deuisyon in the churche / that is
to wet bytwene Bonyface the fyrste and
eulalyus cardynall preest. The cause of
theyr dyuysyon was that y^ clarge ware
departed in to two partes and sortes / in
the which tyme the Emperour Theodo|sius
beyng at Mallan w^t his wyfe were
banyshed  shortly after Boniface was
reuoked agayne and so made bisshop of
Rome onely / after that vnto y^ fyfte sys|me
began the heryses of Predestynacyo~
y^ whiche affyrmed y^ no son aueyled to
do any good werkes but euery so~ to do
his pleasure for god had predestynated
euery ma~ to be saued  da~pned at his ple+sure
 in this seaso~ was asse~bled a cou~cel
at Co~stantynople in the tyme of gratia~
Emperour  theodose  damascus bys|shop
of Rome agaynst the errour of the
macedonyans.

So folowyng not lo~ge after was asse~+bled
y^ thyrde great counceyll at Ephese,
by the co~mau~dement of Theodose afore
wryte~  bysshop Telestyn against y^ here+syes
of the Nestoryans / which held opy+nyon / 
that the virgyn marye was not
mother to the sone of God  in this opy+nyon
was many countres sore infected
with / as Fraunce, Spayne, Affrique,
with many other small domynyons / in
whiche tyme Ursula  her co~pany suffe|red
deth and martyrdome at Colone.
And in this season was assembled the
iiii. generall counceyll in Calsydonye in
Asia the lesse end / the which was asse~ble
ccccc.xxx. bysshops by y^ auctoryte of bys+shop
Leo the fyrste of y^t name /  Marsu~
then emperour This assemble was to
co~uicte the heryses of Eutycyanes ab|bot
of Constantynople who held opyny+on
that Chryst had take~ humanyte vpo~
hymself  y^t he had i~ hym but one nature
that was pure dyuynyte / the whiche he|ryses
was fordone by y^ sayd counceyll / 

and shortly after began another sysme
called Archefallyke / y^t is to wyte with|out
a hed / which denyed all Canons of
the sayd counseyll.
And this tyme befel a great mischyfe
in Rome that Anastasius then seconde
bysshop of that name / borne in Rome
became an herityke  was named the se+conde
bysshop abhomynable in Rome / 
for he fauoured the opynyons of y^t nesto+ryans
as Lyberius bysshop dyd afore
wryten toke the opinyons of the Arians
and this Anastasius was the fyrst that
gaue out cursse vpon any Emperour or
Kynge,  in synne this cursed Bysshop
dyed full of misery, in somoch y^t his bow+elles
fell from hym syttyng at the sole
of eysment as stores make me~cyon  he
raygned one yere and .xxiiii. dayes.


Of the .v. sysme and counceylles
gadred for the vnyte of the chur|che
/ and destruccyon of dy|uers
herysyes.

_THe .v. sysme of the churche
of Rome beganne the yere .494.
this sysme beganne by+twene
Symachus and Lau+rence
the cause of this dyuisyo~ was that
the clargye could not agree in theyr voy+ces / 
whiche of these two shuld holde the
see of Rome for the which rose great dy|uysyon
and dyssencyon in two pertes a|monge
the Romayns / and in fine agre|ed
to assemble a counceyll at Rauenna
in y^ presens of Theodore Kynge of Go+tes / 
In the whiche counceyll they agre|ed
that Symachus shulde be bysshop
through Theodore y^ Kynge / which bys|shop
was at Sardyne /  Laureus was
made bysshop of Nucerre thus was fy|nyshed
the .v. sysme.


Of the .vi. sysme of the
Churches.
THrough the forsayd bysshops was
the .vi. sysme fyrste w^t in foure yers
some of y^ clargy of Rome sediciuos per|sons
and louers of newe tydynges with

help of two senatours conspyred to de|pose
Simacus bisshop and wolde haue
put in Laure~s afore wryten / here vpon
the Kynge Theodoryke beynge sore a|greued
/ he set one Peter Altyne to kepe
the see of Rome for hym selfe and cha|sed
the forsayd two bysshops in exyle / 
and so in co~clusyon the sayd Symacus
assembled a cou~ceyl of .vi. score bisshops
and they purged hymselfe cleane of all
thynges / there layd agaynst hym for the
whiche he abode styll bysshop of Rome,
and yet notwithsto~dynge there was su|che
dyscorde  vprorers among the Ro|mayns
/ y^e oftentymes many were slayne
in the stretes both Preestes and men of
lawe / in somoch y^e one Faustus a great
man of power set a dyreccion amonge
the senatours / or els had folowed grea|ter
ruyne / thus maye ye se what vertue
or debat arose by y^e possessio~  gift that
Constantine gaue to y^ church of Rome.


The .vii. sysme of the
churche of Rome.

_IN this tyme raygned Empe+rour
of Constantynople Iu+styniane
the seconde of that
name / in whose tyme was
Seresinus borne in Surrey. Anno xp~i .706.
Agaynst the whiche arose an Anty|pape
whiche helde byforse the dygnyte
of Rome / whose name was Diascorus / 
thus began the .vii. sisme in the churche
of Rome / with great persecucyon  try|bulacyon
in Rome / whiche continewed
a great season vnto the tyme of Grego|ry
the seconde of that name / borne in
Rome w^t another named Sygysmond,
thorowe whose enormytes the fayth of
Chryst began sore to decay in the oryent
partes / and through this horlay burlay
the bysshops of Rome toke corage / and
lyfted vp theyr hornes / y^ is theyr power
agaynst the Emperours more then euer
was sene / for this Gregorye  Anastase
were the second abhominable bisshops
that raygned in Rome after Anastase / 
whiche was so bold to exco~munycat his

Emperour Leon y^ .iii. of his name y^ whi+che
cause was y^ he wolde a put downe
the worshippyng of ymages through al
crystendome sayeng it was ydolatry ha+ted
of god /  the pope w^tstonde it beforse
wherthrough arose great bandes of co~|panyes
 of persyalytes bytwene Empe+rours
 bisshops / wherthrough oftimes
sysmes hath ben renewed  thus during
this sysme  discorde / arose out of Afri|que
a great army of Sarazyns  entred
into spayne /  wone the Realme of Gra|nado
/ and so kept it by force yl w^t great
polecy and forse of Prynces  Kynges
wane it agayne / also in this tyme was a
great armye of Sarazyns in Fraunce / 
which were reculed byforse of armes by
Charles Prynce and Martyre  in this
tyme of Gregory began the Lent of for|ty
dayes to be fasted / y^ which Lent Mel+chiades,
predecessour of saynt Siluester
strongly withstode  defended / bycause
therby myght engender great corrupci|on
and infexion vnyuersally among cry+sten

people. As wytnessed then the coun+ceyll
of Physycions expert.
And in this tyme of contynuau~ce of
malyce in the Churche, one Constanty|ne
bysshop of Rome vsurped the see of
the papasy by force,  by money, whose
eyes were perforce put out,  so put i~ pry+son
in a monasterye, by the whiche he is
named the .v. abhomynable bysshop of
Rome. And in this tyme began the nacy+on
of Turkys, that came out of Tarta|ry
who enuayed sore the part oryentall
And so mynysshed sore chrystendome.
And this heresyes dyd encrease more 
more, where through they were enforsed
to assemble the .vii. counceyll at Consta~|tynople
for the  and worshyp+pynge
of Images in the Churche
whiche many sayd it was Ido|latrye,
and for certayne other
Articles that the Greke chur+che
had agaynst the
holy ghost.



Here foloweth the seconde parte of
this boke, whiche treateth of the .v.
fyrste counceylles holden by the
churche Gallicane at Orly|aunce.
And the thyrde was
co~maunded by kyng Clo+wys,
the fyrste crysten
kyng in Fraunce.
THe noble  maketh men+sion
that Clowys the fyrste crysten
kyng of Fraunce / whiche was bytwene
the .iiii.  y^e .v. sysme then reygned. And
this kyng was y^e fyrst crysten that assem+bled
a general cou~cel i~ Orliau~ce. Anno.
dn~i .486. Raynyng y^t tyme at Co~sta~tino|ple
y^ emour zeneme. And at y^ tyme sat
in y^ apostolyk see  y^ .iii. of y^ name
And about  tyme rayned ki~g Artur
of Englande and he sent a presydent to
that cou~cell at orliau~ce one named Mel+lanius,
which he sent for a good purpo|se
for the welth of the churche.


Of the councell Germanik, holden
in the tyme of Charlemayn the great.

This Charlemain rayned emperour
oer Almayne, Frau~ce, and Ytaly,
which assembled this counceyll in a cyte
in Germanya called Herbypolys in the
tyme of Adryan the fyrst bisshop of that
name / as Platyne wryteth y^ which cou~|ceyll
the Grekes called the great Sino|da,
and there was condempned the opy|nyon
of the Felycyans the whiche sayd
that no Ymages ought to be in the chur+che,
and shortly after Pope Leo y^ thyrd
of y^ name came into Fraunce to Charle
mayne / complaynynge of thre Preestes
which had done hym great vltrage and
dyspleasure / y^ one named Pasculis the
other Priisserius / y^ thyrde called Ca~|pulus
/ y^e which with many of theyr opy|nyon
droue out of Rome the sayd Adry|an
 w^t all his affynyte for goyng on pre|cessyon
and syngyng the Lateny which
Gregory instytuted and ordayned afore
for the which Charlemayn was sore dis|pleased
/ and so at the sayd Adryans re|quest
Charlemayn raysed a great army

and went to Rome / to set Adryan bys|shop
in his see agayne / wherthrough he
had the name of the Empyre of Rome / 
which he gaue to the see of rome  great
possessyons  rychesse / as his father Pe+pyn
dyd afore hym as dyuerse such suc|cessours
hath syas contynued and aug|mented.


Of a great cou~ceyll holden at Aquis
Granu~ in y^ tyme of Emour Lowys
de bo~nere sone to Charlemayn whi|che
lyeth buryed in Aquis granu~.
_OF this cou~ceyll wryteth Pla+tyne
historyograffer / y^t there
were assembled al the Pryn+ces
and counceylles vnder y^
power and domynyon of Lowys de bo~|nere
the which Lowys at this connceyll
gaue Lotere his sone parte of his Em|pyre
/ and crowned hym kyng of Ytaly / 
and Pepyn his seconde sone he named
hym kynge of Acquitayne / and Lowys

his thyrde sone he named kynge of Ba|uarye
/ and at this counceyll y^ Infydel|les
and Sarasyns laboured for Peace
whiche was grau~ted / and at the whiche
cou~ceyll was compyled a great Boke of
Lawes and co~stytucyons for ecclesiasti|call
ceremonies and orders / which were
straytly kept which boke was made and
compyled by Amalarius a man florys|shynge
in Learnynge in that tyme /  at
this tyme of Lowys y^ good Kynge and
Emperour / he perceyuynge the abhomi+nable
pryde that exceded in bysshops of
Rome and other prelates of y^e Churche / 
as amonge Preestes / and other meane
sorte / such Pompe, and Rayment, so pre+syous / 
 rych, and superfluous withall
and to moch gasynge and glysterynge / 
set with Ge~mys, perle,  stone / lyke Kyn+ges
and Prynces,  on theyr Fyngers
ryche Rynges and so this good Kynge
co~mau~ded this pryde  glory to be fordo+ne / 
and caused a more sadder and a sym+pler
facyon and maner of rayment vsed

and worne and thrusted downe al theyr
pryde  pompe / and caused y^t no bisshop
nor prelate shuld were but one Ryng of
Golde / which shuld serue for his singne
and seal, and so they were co~tented and
agreed / also as Platyne wryteth the bis+shop
of Rome Steuen y^ fourth of that
name borne in Rome / and successour of
Leo the thyrde beynge at the sayd coun|ceyll
fled frome the Romayns  came in+to
Fraunce to kynge Lowys the good
Kynge at Orlyaunce /  was there hono+rably
receyued and at his retorne gaue
hym ayed and strength to retorne to Ro+me / 
and he gaue hym a crosse of so great
valoure that was inestymable to iudge,
whiche was sent as an offrynge to seynt
Peter.


Of the coursed and wycked cou~ceyll
that was holde~ at Campyne by the
prelates of Frau~ce agaynst the
sayd good kynge Lowys.

_THere was about this tyme a
detestable and wycked coun+ceyll
 a permysyous, which
was gadered by euyll aucto+ryte
* * * * * of the wycked prelates
of Fraunce / whiche conspyred agaynst
theyr good Kynge Lowys / bycause he
set a dyreccyon and good order agaynst
theyr dishonest lyuynge pompe, pryde, 
abhomynacyon, and superfluytes as a|fore
was wryten / and thus this wycked
counceyll of prelates conspyred a great
insurreccyon and army of moch people / 
as the sone against the father and frend
agaynst frend /  so toke the good Kyng
Lowys,  put hym captyue at seysons
in a stronge hold. And to this conspyrese
was agreed, pope Gregory y^ .iiii. of his
name bycause he was not benefyciall to
the Churche of Rome at that tyme, and
for redressyng many enormyt. And not
so benefycyall as he was to other Bys|shops
afore. And as the orator Raphael
of voluntary testyfyeth of this wycked

counceyll  companye assembled with|out
auctoryte. And so there these tray|tours
co~dempned this good kyng with|out
auctoryte /  deposed hym frome all
armes and out of his dignyte emperyal
and dyspoyled hym of his Kynges ray|ment
and put on hym a monkes kole
in derysyon.
O cursed  wycked Pharysyans / re|pleat
with treason and ypocresy sacerdo+tall
/ howe can ye conspyre so great abho+mynacyon
and cruelty agaynst so good
a kynge / for redressynge your Antecristi+an
lyuynge / pompe  pryde / suerly this
is not your fyrst cruelty for ye began w^t
the hede y^t was our sauyour Iesu Christ
whome ye shamfully crucyfyed and put
to deth.
And thus contynued the good kynge
Lowys captyue indesolacyon amonge
his ennemyes / tyll God prouyded for
hym through good cou~ceylles /  iustyce
diuyne of Kynges and Prelates that he
was restored to his originall tytle empe+rour

and Kynge of Fraunce agayne.


Of the cou~ceyll of Troyes in Cham|pane
/ holden by the kynge Lowys
that stutted in his speakynge.
_IN the tyme of this Lowys / 
sone of Charles came in to
Fraunce / Iohn~ bysshop of
Rome the .viii. of that name
borne in Rome / And escaped out of the
prysons and captyuyte of the Romayns
which hated hym bycause he wold haue
crowned this sayd Lowys y^ sutter Em+perour
of Rome / for the Romayns wol|de
rather haue had Charles his brother
kynge of Germanye / and not onely for
this cause he fled but bycause of two er|les
which wolde haue taken frome hym
the patrymonye of the Churche / and in
this cause he dyd curse the~ / and so came
for socour in to fraunce and there abode
a .xii. monethes /  desyred the help of the
Kynge / which could not come / bycause
he lay secke at Towers notwithsta~dyn|ge

within short tyme after he recouered
his sykenesse / then he  the bysshop met
togyther in Troyes in Champane and
there assembled a counceyll of the chur|che
Gallycane.
And thus at this sayd counceyll were
determyned many holy decrees /  there
they confyrmed a bysshop to be Pastore
ouer the countre of Flaunders / whiche
was a wylde Forest for to make Colys / 
and full of maryse as Platyne wryteth / 
which afterwarde was replet with peo|ple
and townes / wherthrough it is to be
coniectured they be vnder the dioses of
Tornay as yet remayneth.
Yet furthermore at this sayd cou~ceyll
this said Iohn~ bysshop gaue the crown
empyre to kyng Lowys the stuter  al|led
him august, yet wold not he grau~t to
crowne his wyfe Quene /  so after this
counceyll fynyshed / Iohn~ bysshop the .viii. of that name retorned to Rome / to
warre on the Sarasyns whiche were en+tred
in to the partys of Italye.



Of two cou~ceylles holden at Ray+nys
one agaynst another one
by the kynges  the other
by the bysshop of
Rome.
_AGaynst these counceylles the
bysshop Benedict the .vii. of
that name / caused to asse~ble
another counceyll at Raynes
in the which Arnulphus was restored to
the byshoprych of Rayns and the
vsurped bysshop deposed / 
which was after Arch|bysshop
of Reuenna
and syns bys|shop
of
Rome by crafte and meanes
of Diabolyke scyence
wherin he was expert / 
yet notwithstandyn|ge
he ended his
dayes my|serably,



Of a great cou~ceyll generall asse~bled
at Cleremo~de in Auernea / i~ the tyme
of Phyllyp the fyrste of that name,
Emperour kynge of Frau~ce, there
present Urbanus y^ seco~de bys|shop
of that name in Rome / 
in the which cou~ceyl was y^
great vyage of Godfroy
debullyon set forth vpo~
the sarasyns / where
by the fayth of Chryste was
largely encreased
in Turkey. 
_THis holy bysshop of Rome
Urban the .xii. of that name
Abbot of Clunye a blacke
monke and Cardynall of
Hostyensis, was moued w^t 
pyte and compassyon thorow the lame~|table
complayntes of the worthy pylgr+me
Peter the heremyte borne at Mens / 
the whiche came lately from the holy la~+de.
And so informed Urban of the mys+ry

and poerte,  seruytude that crysten
people were in there with the patryarke
Symon in Ierusalem. So this com|playnt
herynge Urban, moued with co~|passyon
 prepayred with all dylygence
for succour  delyuerau~ce of them there
beyng in the thraldom  dau~ger of Sa|rasyns,
turkys,  Infidels, which cryste~
people laye in this thraldom from the
tyme of Hiracle, whiche was the yere of
our Lorde god .cccc.lxxx. or there aboute
as platyne wryteth.
And shortlye after Urban was in so
greate trouble and veracyon amonge
the Romayns, that they were fayne to
flye out of Rome, and came in to Fraun+ce.
And there was assembled throughe
his commynge a great counceyll of all
the Prelates of the Churche catholyke
whiche was holden in the cytie of Cle|remount
in Ouernia. And some storyes
sayth that Phillyp y^e fyrste of that name
assembled another counceyll agaynst y^e

Hollandes. And so whan the great cou~|cell
of Urban the bysshop of rome was
assembled in the holy Ghost / this sayde
Urban made an excellent and elygant
Oration to that asse~ble. And there ther|of
breyfly  sentenciously I gadred as
foloweth concernynge the vyage to Ie|rusalem
for the delyueraunce and capty+uyte
of the crysten people.
All ye honourable audyence here as|sembled
ye shall vnderstande y^t I whi|che
haue taken on me vnworthy this en+tendeth
to set good ordre and reforma|cyon
in all thynge accordynge to the ca|tholyke
Relygyon of Chryste.
It is not vnknowen to you what in|gerys
and losse hathe ben of late dayes
in crystendome by Sarasyns and In|fydellys
without mercy or pytie / with
great warres and battayllys / for the
whiche remedy is there none but by for|ce
of armys / wherfore to redresse it as
we and you be very Ctristyans stonde
faste in the fayeth / and lette vs seke

remedy for this pyteous tyranny that
chrysten people do susteyne, and Reme~|bre
the great dylygence that your predy+sessours
hath had in this behalfe in ty|mes
paste, And spetyally ye nobles of
Fraunce, whiche hath alwaye susteyned
agaynst the Infydelys, also you Ger|mayns
 Saxons  Polax, Bohemys,
and hungaryon and Englysshe nacyon
ye shulde not suffer this tyranny vpon
Chrysten people so pyteously also ye I|talyons
shulde remembre what paynes
and tyranny your predycessoures fren|des
of late dayes hath suffred by them
also ye venecyans  ye of Dalmase and
of Hystrye / and al ye bourderars of the
Ardryatyque sees whiche haue alwaye
valyantly defended the malyse  power
of the Sarasyns / now apply your selfe
withal other princes to withstande this
cruell Infydellys or els ye shall se your
chyldren / your wyfes / your goods / and
lyues, vtterly destroyed by cruelty, wher+fore
awake all ye valyaunt personage

and we humbly desyre you in y^ mercy of
God / put on your armyes  sprede forth
your standardes and Baners  set forth
your co~paynyes w^t great courage / and
God y^t is most puysau~t shal be with you
 send his omnypotent powre to ayed 
strength you in all your wayes  to con|founde
all that shall withstande you.


Howe by the means of this oracyon
made by Urbanus bysshop of Rome
through it all Prynces on this syde
Co~stantinople toke great courage
and enforsed the~ to assemble great
armyes on all partes to go vpon
the sarasyns /  so to Ierusalem.
_ANd thus as sone as Urba|nus
had fynysshed his oracy+on
all that were there prese~t / 
arose  sayd with one voyce
this is the wyll  pleasure of God / and
therwith Urban blessyd theym all say|enge
this blessyng / I gyue you as lo~ge

as ye shall endure this Iourney / and ye
shall vnderstand y^ in this assemble and
cou~ceyll was many noble worthy Pryn+ces
and barons, and noble men the whi|che
many of them solde theyr landes, ho+pynge
to prospere in this Iourney to y^
hye honour and seruyse of God / wherof
is made mencyon i~ dyuerse crownacles
more at large / in the which iourney god
fray of Bullyon was the chefe of that
enterpryse / and thus was fynyshed the
counceyll of Cleremont.


Of the cou~ceyll of Troyes in Cham|payne
by bysshop Pascall y^ twelfth
for y^ reformacyons of y^ Churche.
AFter this great cou~ceyll arose the .17. sisme in the church / in the tyme
of Paschall bysshop of Rome the .12. of
that name borne in Italye afore a mo~ke
and so successour of Urbanus / whiche
came into Fraunce for to haue reforma|cyon
of dyuerse abuses y^ was the~ in the
Church farre frome al good facyon and
order wheron he caused a counceyl to be
assembled generall / wherin was refor|med

many thynges / and specyally he de+posed
many prelates and benefysed me~ / 
which were necligent  vnlearned from
theyr pastoralyte  curyous /  admytted
such as were able for suche promocyons
and to preache and gyue example of ly|uynge
in Chrystes churche.


Of the counceyll holden at Rayns by
Calixte bysshop of Rome / brother to y^
erle of Burgoygne / in y^ which cou~+ceyll
Henry the fourth Emperour
was accoursed and exco~municat.
AFter this Pascal rayned gyles the
seconde of y^ name borne in Italye
in whose tyme fell the .18. sysme in y^ whi|che
suffred many trybulacyons  perse|cucions
as ye shall fynde in the tyme of
Henry the fourth Emperour which cre|ated
an antypape named Benedictus / y^
whiche antypape pope Gyles droue out
of Ytalye / and so fled into Fraunce.
And so in the absent see of this sayde
Gyles possessed the see bysshoppe of Uy|nne
named Guy of Burgongne, which

was in y^ holy lande of Ierusalem when
Godftay de Bullyon, the whiche Guy
was taken and accepted for a man of an
acceptable lyfe, whose name was after|warde
called Calixtus the .ii. but yet as
storys saith y^ the forsayd Gylys was he
y^ coursed Henry the emperour in y^ cou~|ceyl
and not this Calyxt / for he was nye
a kyne to y^ emperour Henry whiche ma+ryed
Made doughter to the kynge of
Englande and this sayd curse was gy|uen
by Gyles Bysshop bycause of the
reformacyon of the pryde  pompe that
then was vsurped among prelates and
preestes / as well in dignytes  theyr auc+torytes / 
as in excesse of gorgyous appa|rell
 a rayment also partly as Platyne
wryteth it was for y^ supportynge of an
Antypape named Burdyn a spanyard / 
as here after in the thyrde parte here of
shal make mensyon and so was Calyxt
made bisshop  stauled in Rome byforse
 caused y^ emour Henry to be beseged,
the yte of rayns where he was acursed.



Of the seconde cou~ceyl holden at Cle+remond / 
and of a nother holden at
Rayns in Champayne almoost
in one tyme.
_INnocent y^ seco~de bysshop
of Rome and borne in y^ sa|me
Cytie helde warre  ba+tayle
agaynst Roger nor|munde
Kynge of Naples / 
* * * * * and y^ sone of Roger vayn|quyshed
this bisshop Innocent i~ playne
Batyle / and toke hym  his cardinalles
prysoners / yet notwithstandynge this
prynce Wyllyam etreated hym  his
cardynalles gently and honorably / and
in contynuaunce he set theym at lyberty
lyke a noble man.
And this tyme indurynge was a no|ther
bysshop of Rome named / Anacle|tus,
by whom y^ forsayd Innocent was
chased out of Rome /  this was y^ .xviii.
sysme as ye shall playnly se in the laste
parte of this boke.

And thus in that tyme by the aduyse|ment
of kynge Lowys y^ grosse was hol+den
two counceylles in Fraunce / in the
whiche was the forsayd Innocent pre|sent
/ these cou~ceylles were holden at cle|remont
i~ Ouernya /  the other at rayns
in Champayne in the which cou~ceylles
were determyned dyuerse decrees and
by the whiche Innocent ouercame
his aduersary annacletus his
antipape and so he retour+ned
to Rome agayne

For the which cause kynge Lowys y^

Of the thyrd councell holde~ in Ouer+nya

 dyuysion endured in the churche
.xvii. yeres / agaynst .iiii. Antypapes that
then rayned  were suffered by y^ empe|roure

frederyke called Barbarouse / and
so this Alyxsau~der fled out of Rome for
socoure vnto kynge Phillype augustus
who then assembled a cou~ceyll in Clere|monde
in Ouernya agaynst the forsayd
Frederyke / for mayntenynge of victor
Antypape / by the which varyaunce and
dyuysyon in crystendome, in this meane
season Ierusalem was wonne by y^e soul
dan Saladyne / which was neuer yet re+couered
to this day this was the yere of
Chryste .1184. and so this emperour Fre+deryk
wolde fayne a brought to passe a
vnyte  concorde /  wold haue had this
coceyl at Dygyon i~ Burgony where
they shulde amet with kynge Phyllype,
and the kynge of Boheme, and kynge

antypape Uictor / whiche he brought all
to passe byforce of armes, or els not.
But yet this Alexsaunder bysshup of
Rome wolde not consent to come there / 
for he had that place in susspecke and so

gadered a nother counceyll at Towers,
and thus y^ emperour Frederyk / in spyte
and displeasur returned in to Almayne / 
and sent Uictor his antypape in to ta|lye
 thus was al thyng in more pertur

Of two cou~ceylles in fraunce holden
in Parys in Phyllyps tyme / and
of the disie of Salandyne.
_IN the tyme of this phyllip au+gust / 
came Enbassatoures
quene Isabel from the kynge
of Ierusalem which came for
socour for the cristen prysoners y^ Sala|dyne
solda~ had in captyuite / wherupon
was gadered a cou~seyll at Parys to no
purpose, but for the socour of crysten me~

for the kyng Phillyp had as then great
warre agaynst Hew duke of Burgone
and other.
And thus this sayd Phillyp sent en|bassatours
to kynge Rycharde curede|lyon
desyring hym of ayed in this cause
to the whiche he graunted w^t good wyll
 so / shortly after he assembled a great
armye on both partys of Fraunce, and
England, and went on a croose agaynst
the ennemys of cristendome / but the for+sayd
ki~g Richard could not obtayne his
purpose for he was slaine afore a Castel

the bysshops kynswoman and herupon
the Kynge armyd hym  raysed a great
armye /  he exyled all the bysshops that
consented to the curse / and put them in
Pryson and frome theyr benefyces c.


Of the counceyll holden at
Parys / agaynst the albygens.
_IN y^ tyme of Lowys father
to saynt Lowys then Grego+ry
the .ix. rayned Anno. Dn~i
.1226. then came in to Frau~ce
a legat from the Bysshop / whiche legat
was named Romanus  there was ga|dred

a cou~ceyll they concluded to warre
vpon the herytykes Albygoys / whiche
was in y^ cou~re of Auynion, in Prouau~+ce,
 Languedock, whiche were repleat
with great vyllany and herysyes, and so
the Kynge went vpon these countryes 
subdued them, and in retournyng home
he dyed.


Of the fyrst cou~ceyl holden at Lyons
in the tyme of saynt Lowys kynge / 
and of Innocent bysshop of Rome
the .4. of y^t name borne in Genys.
THe which bisshop came into Frau~|ce
for socor for case that the Em|perour
Frederyk persecuted hym / Anno
Dn~i .1246. and y^ Emperour was syted
to appere at this counceyll and came w^t
a great company / and at turayne he re|tourned
home agayne for his ennemies
were entred into his countrye.
This debat contynued long tyme the
space and tyme of thre bysshops of Ro|me

successyuely / y^ was Honorius the .3.
the other Gregorye /  Innocent afore
wryten / and thus thorow y^ cruell obsty|nacy
of these bysshops there arose great
mischeffe  dissencion through al cristen+dome,
 so therby was engendred great
war in al crystendom in the which tyme
of warres was lost Constantinople  so
at this cou~ceyl was nothyng concluded
through the great ruyne that fell in cry|stendome
/ by these forsayd bysshops of
Rome one after a nother.


Of the seconde counceyl of Lions / in
the tyme of Gregory the tenth / and
in y^ tyme of kynge Phyllyp sone

THe yere of grace .1232. rained kyng
Phillip sone to saint Lowys / who
assembled a nother counceyll at Lyons
wherunto came Gregorye bysshop the
tenth borne in Plesaunce / this Kynge
Phyllyp was the fyrst y^ gaue y^ bisshop

a garde of men of armys / also he gaue
hym .3. stronge Places for his sauegard
about Lyon / and to this counceyll came
themperour Michel paleolog of Con|stantinople
/ for the Reformacion of the
greke church / which had fallen the .xiii.
tyme in to Ruyne, and yet wolde not be
reformed.


Of another cou~cell holden at Parys,
in the tyme of kyng Phillyp the fayre / 
agaynst y^ bysshop bonyface the
eyght whiche vsed great ty|ranny
agaynst y^ Clerge.
_PHyllyp the fayre a prudent 
vertuous kyng began to ray+gne
.1286  in his tyme posses+sed
the see of Rome Boniface
the .viii. successoure of Celestyne the .v.
which was a wyse and a vertuous man
the which Bonyface craftely deceyued / 
 this bonyface was of the nature  fa|cyon
of the Italyans / as arrogaunte,

and fyerse, which nothynge considering
the beneficial giftes y^t his predecessours
had receyued in Frau~ce / as ye shall here
more at large.
This sayd Bonyface the .8. sent as
strayte a co~maundement vnto the kyng
of Frau~ce by an enbassade a fyerse bys|shop
/ howe that the sayd Kynge shulde
in contynent without delay go and pre+payre
in al hast a great nauey and an ar+mye
also, to go into the holy Lande / the
which y^ sayd Kynge coulde not brynge
to passe / forcause of great warres y^t he
had at y^t time against y^ Flau~ders nacio~.
And thus this sayd Arrogau~t bishop
seynge y^t he coulde not obtayne his pur|pose
/ began to threten  rebuke y^ kynge
rygoryously sayeng that in case that he
wolde not fulfyll his message / he wolde
cause hym to fle out of his Realme / and
for bycause y^ this bysshop enbassatour
vsed hymselfe so rygorously / agaynst y^
Kynge / the Kynge toke hye displeasure
and straytly co~maunded hym to pryson.

After this tydinges came to this fore+sayd
Boniface the .viii. Coloryk, proud
and arrogant aboue mesure, And sente
strayght an Archedeacon Embasadour
co~maundyng the kyng phyllyp the fay|re
that he shulde not enterpryse to take
nor rayse no money Subsidie vpon the
churche, the whiche subsydie he was en|forced
to do for the great warres that he
was charged with at that tyme / for his
defence. And the sayd archedeacon dys|charged
the sayd kyng for the Inpryso|neme~t
of the sayd bysshop, that he shuld
be exyled all y^ iurisdixion of Rome. And
that it shuld be auctorysed in Rome, for
euer his disobedyence and so taken / no|mynated
as an Herytyke, and a sysma|tyke,
also y^ sayd Archdyacon syted hym
with dyuers other Bysshops /  prelats
of the Cleargy to come vnto Rome par|sonally
by a certeyn day / and disanulled
all the Preuylages of grauntes  par|dons
gyuen by his predycessours of the
see of Rome.

This was an extreme rygoure in the
presens of all his barons and counceyll
whiche was so dysdaynous  proudly
spoke by the sayd enbassatour / without
any seueryte or of good order / and yf the
Kynge were moued or abasshed it was
no marueyle /  so co~mau~dynge with so|ber
aduysement y^t the fyrst Enbassatour
the bysshop shuld be set at lybertye / and
that in all the hast with further delibera+cyon
he shulde depart his Realme / and
so in short tyme after he asse~bled a great
counceyll of Bysshops /  barons / in the
whiche the Kynge openyd all the vltra|ges
and abhomynacyons y^t the forsayd
Innocent the eyght vsed agaynst hym / 
and openly there expressed howe sham|fully
 craftely this Boniface / came by
the see of Rome, and tourned hym to the
Clargy  to y^ Lordes temporal sayeng,
of whome holde ye your Landes  pos|sessyons
but of me / wherfore I wyll ye / 
ye henseforth not so hardy to send or pay
any money or treasour / to y^ court of Ro+me

/ and hereupon caused all brydges,
portys, and passages, to be stopped and
kept /  thus Boniface y^ bysshop of Ro|me
cursed hym /  co~spyred great malyce
and ingeris agaynst y^ Kyng  procured
great enuyte agaynst hym by certayne
Prynces / and shortly this was the fyne
and co~clusion of this debate was thus.
The Kynge seynge y^ importunat ma+lyce
of this Antecryst bysshop / y^ Kynge
caused .200. men of armys conduted by
two subtyle and wyse persons / and they
which went to y^t towne of agnane / wher
the Bysshop lay in Naplys / and toke
hym ther in  brought hym prysoner to
Rome / where he dyed myserably for do|loure
 cursed mynde within .24. dayes
after, and his epytaphe was suche lyke
as he deserued as foloweth.
Intrauit vt Uulpes, regnauit vt Leo,
mortuus est vt cauis, y^t is in Englysshe
he entred as a Foxe,  rained lyke a Ly|on,
and dyed as a Doge.



Of a nother cou~ceyll holden in fraun+ce
at Uyenne. Anno Dn~i .892.
THe auctour founde in olde auncy|aunt
Lybrary a Boke at Lyons / 
wherin was wryten, that from the tyme
of Formosus bysshop of Rome / began
the .ix. sisme which shalbe more leargely
treated of, in y^ thyrd parte of this boke,
and so by the co~mau~dement of Lowys
Kynge otherwyse called Lowys le bal|be
throughe the counceyll of his wyfe / 
assembled a counceyll in the churche of
saynt Saluatour where were gadered
two legat of Rome, the one named pas+cal / 
the other Iohn~ /  the archebysshop
of Uyenne / and Aurelyan archebysshop
of Ualencie / with many other prelates,
and learned men of the Clergye, and yet
at this tyme the preestes were maryed / 
and at this counceyll was decreed this
acte worde for worde.
Ut presbiteri non in villis / sicut qui|busdam
consuetudinis est (morentur) et

feminas suas secum in domibus suis
habitare non permittant, exceptis quas
canonicas permittit auctoritas / that is

theyr wyfes with them dwellyng
shulde no more so be suffered (but onely
those) as shulde be permytted  suffered
by the auctoryte of the holy Canons.


Of a nother general cou~ceyl holden
at Uyenne in Dolphyne .1312.
_AFter y^ Ignomynyous and
shamfull deth of Bonyface
afore wryten y^ .8. of that na|me
bysshop of Rome, succe|ded
Benedict y^ eleuenth borne at Tar+uyse
in Italye a blake Frere which was
amoderat parsone / nothynge lyke his
predycessour for he assoyled Phillip kyn+ge
of Fraunce of y^t sensurys of the chur|che
whiche bisshop Bonyface surmysed
agaynst hym  so this good bysshop ray+ned

but eyght monethes and .17. dayes
after whom rayned Clement y^ .v. a gas|ken
borne, archbysshop of Burdux whi|che
was chosen by the Cardynallys re|sydent
for the tym, ethe yere of our Lor|de,
at the instaunce of kynge Phyllyp
la bel .1305.
Thus shortly after this sayd Cleme~t
assembled a great companye of Cardy|nalles
 Bysshops, to no lytell cost and
charge to all y^ churche of Fraunce / and
so came to Lyons with great pompe, 
wordly glory, where met with hym ma|ny
cardynalles of Italye / where as he
was corwned with great pompe  Roy+alty / 
at the which coronacion was kyng
Phyllyp la bel w^t his brother Charles 
all the prynces of Fraunce /  in all this
pompe  royalty, befell a great sodayne
myschau~ce / where as a great nombre of
people were slayne in the fall of a great
olde wall where as moche people were
asse~bled for to beholde this great pomp
and ryalty / in the which fall was layne

the duke Iohn~ of Brytanye  the kyng
sore hurte, and the new bysshop smyten
from his Horse / in so moch y^ his crowne
fell from his hed /  lost the rychest stone
there one called a Carbuncle / estemed
worth .vi.M. duccat,  thus after this
mysfortunat aduentour this sayd bys|shop
Clement departed from Lyons / 
came to Auygnyon wher as he abode / 
there remoued the See appostolyque
from Rome vnto Auignyon / the whiche
see appostolike remoued abode there the
space .lxxiii. yeres after afore it was re|moued
to Rome agayne.
The syxt yere after the forsayd Cle|mentis
coronacyon which was the yere
.1311. in the moneth of Noue~bre was asse~+bled
a great generall cou~ceyl vnyuersal
through all crystendome in the Cytie of
Uyenna i~ Dolphyne / wher as was asse~|bled
aboue .300. prelates of dyuerse cou~+tres
through all crystendom /  this cou~+ceyl
was partly gadered at kyng Phil|lips
req~st to reproue y^e forsayd boniface

an herytyke  a sismatyke / whiche was
his cruell ennemy  to disanul his actes
and decrees / howbeit it came not to pas
though clement bysshop promysed hym
the cou~ceyll wold not consent therunto / 
yet notwithsta~dyng it was iudged / sayd
and declared that his actes / and decrees
against y^ Kynge, were nowght  vniust
and of no valoure.
Also at this cou~ceyll was vtterly de|stroyed
all the rules  wrytynges of the
Templers and brent them and all theyr
possessyons gyuen vnto y^ order of saynt
Iohn~s in Ierusalem the which we call
the knyghtes of the Rodes.
Also at this cou~ceyll the gray Fryers
were at great dyuysyon within them sel+ues
for y^ which was decred many actes
and decrees in y^ canon boke called Cle|mentynys
/ compyled by this sayd Cle|ment
bysshop of Rome / also at this cou~|ceyll
was great counceyll for to recouer
the holy Lande / but it nothyng auayled
also some hystoryans holde opynyon y^t

this bysshop Clement kepte two other
cou~ceyls in Fraunce to destroye the he|rysyes
that were in valdoyes, and pye|mont,
and sauoye, this fynyshed y^ great
counseyll of Uyenne.


Of a counceyll holden at
Auynyon.
_AT the tyme of the .xxi. sys|me
/ ye shal here more larg+ly
of in y^ later end of this
boke / and so this cou~ceyll
of Auynyon began by Io+han
bisshop of Rome the .xxii. of y^ name
a graye Fryer / in whose tyme arose an
Antypape by y^ mayntenaunce of them|perour
Lowys of Bauaria / the whiche
antypape helde a counceyll in Italye / 
where as he declared y^ sayd Iohn~ .xxii.
of that name to be an herityke / and this
sayd Antypape and his company helde
opynyon y^ Chryst  his discyples were
pore and y^t they had nothyng pryue nor

comon, the which was proued the coun|trary
in this counceyll of Auynyon.


Of two cou~ceyllys holden in Frau~ce
at Parys in y^ tyme of kynge Char|les
the syxth forcause of a great dys+sencyon
that was in the church
in the two and twenty sysme.
_SOme men wyll thynke that
kynge Phyllyp la bell dyd,
for a polecy cause Clement
to moue the see appostolyke
from Rome,  so to be kept at Auynyo,
but al thynges pondered it tourned his
country to moche trouble / ruyne / and
grefe / as longe as it was there-holden
the space of .lxxiiii. yeres / for as sone as
the see appostolike was moued to Auy|nyo
by Clement, then succedyd Iohn~
the .22. of that name Anno .1327. of our
Lorde  in his tyme rayned Lowys de
Bauaria /  Frederyk duke of oystryche
which had great warre together by this
meane / also kynge Phyllyp de valoys

father of kyng Iohn~ y^ was prysoner in
Engla~d through y^ cause y^ .xxi. sisme of y^
which ye shal here more of in y^ last part
of this boke  thrugh this forsaid cause
arose also an Antipape i~ Italye named
Nycolas y^ thyrd which was supported
by the emperoure / Lowys de Bauarya.
Also yet further inco~uenyenses arose
by this meane y^t this sayd Bisshop prea+ched
and supported dyuerse visions, fa~|tasyes,
and dremyes of contemplacyon / 
whiche was of lytle fayth / y^e whiche dy|uerse
doctoures in dyuyne withstode 
proued the contrarye /  yet furthermore
this sayd bysshop oppressyd y^ realme of
Fraunce w^t imposycyons / donacyons / 
and decimis /  subsides /  expectatyues
with other inuencyons / such as y^ court
of Rome could well co~tryue, in so moch
that no learned man of Parys could ob+tayne
any benefice, but they were polled
and pylled by cardynalles  curtysians
vnder the~ of auynyo~ through y^ whiche
pyllage  abhomynable liuynge it was

generally called the whore of babylon / 
for theyr great pyllage / ryches, pomp, 
pryde, in somoch they had the halfe of al
the benefyces in Frau~ce and this abho|mynacyon
was sore resysted by the vny+uersyte
of Parys.
After this shamful ruyngne y^ sete ap+postolyke
was remoued to rome agayn
Anno Dn~i .1376. in y^ tyme of Gregorye
the eleuenth borne in Lymogys / and he
was not longe without great preiudyce
and flaunder by the .xx. sisme moued by
Urbane the .vi. Neopolitane borne / whi+che
Urbane caused .v. Cardynallys of
Fraunce to be drowned / and in this sea|son
was two bysshops in crystendome / 
the one in Rome and y^ other in Auyny|on
/ in somoch that people were so a ma|sed
 troubled that they colde not iudge
nor knowe which of them was in y^ iust
and in ryght auctoryte / and this sysme
endured .40. yeres which was more tro+blous
and daungerous then any y^ euer
befel afortyme /  thus befel euyll vpon

eyull so the Bohemis became as y^ tyme
requyred farre from the faythe /  vtter|ly
denyed and disspysed the Romayns.
Thus was all crystendome vexed, 
troubled with these two bysshops whi|che
contynued many yeres successyuely
from bysshop to bysshop after the dethe
of Urban y^ which held his see at Rome
after whome succeded Innocent the .7.
and after hym succedyd Augelus a Ue|necyan
whom was named Bonefacius
the .ix. and thus after Clement .vi. y^ dy|ed
in Auygnyon / succedyd Benedictus
.xiii. whose errours were worse the~ were
afore for this Benedictus was very ob|stynat.
By this occasyon was Char|les
sore moued and vnquyeted through
these sysmes /  sent noble enbassatours
vnto Auynyon to y^ bysshop which was
onely for the concorde  vnyte of cristes
Church / but it lytel auayled for they re|tourned
without aunswer.
That seynge the kynge assembled at
Parys a great counceyll of all his pryn+ces

and barons w^t the prelates  the best
learned me~ of his realme / where as they
co~sulted togyder y^t both bisshops shulde
be deposed / wherupon the duke of baua+rye
and y^ duke of Burgone went to the
byshop at Auynyon to discus this mes|sage
with a noble power / and when the
bysshop vnderstode what was theyr co|mynge
and wherfore / for feare to conse~t
fled away secreatly out of Auynyon, 
left them alone without farewel or leue
taken /  retourned in to his natyue cou~|trye
/ wherof these dukes were abasshed
and so retourned to Parys agayne pen|siue
where y^ Kyng lay /  after this they
helde another cou~ceyl in the same Cytie
in the tyme of charles y^ .vi. for this vny+on
of the church to y^ which this bisshop
y^ fled wold not co~se~t nor be co~fyrmable.


Of other two cou~cellys in Frau~ce the

in his tyme in whose time rayned in Ro+me
Iulius bysshop the seconde / whose
artes of ruyne nedeth not my pen to wri+te / 
for his holy liuing is manyfestly kno+wen
of a great many now, yet lyuyn|ge
y^ hath experyence of his cruell actes,
thus is fynysshed y^ seconde part of this
boke / and thus to this the thyrde part I
wyll begyn at the later end of this fyrst
boke which mensioneth of the .vii. sisme
and I wyll begyn this third boke with
the eyght sysme  so end  finish this lyt+le
boke as foloweth.



Here begynneth y^ thyrde boke of this
processe and fyrst of the .viii. sisme  so
procedeth to y^ last shewynge what
inite  mysery befel i~ the chur+che
of rome  i~ other places.
THe emperour Lowys y^ gentle kyn+ge
of Frau~ce, sone of charlemayne
arose the .viii. sisme in y^ church bytwene
Eugenius bysshop of Rome / the .ii. of y^
name borne in Rome /  zozinus antipa|pe,
whiche wrought through dyuerse car+dinals
great displeasures / yet was this
Eugeni a good ma~  a wyse,  so anone
after the takynge of Rome by the Sa|rasyns
/ ther folowed great euyllys thro+ghe
al the worlde and specyally in frau~|ce
/ wherin the Normans  the frysya~s
entred fyrste,  exersysed their cruelty, 
shortly after, Ione the woman bysshop
of rome borne in englonde possessed the
see of Rome with great sclaunder to the
Romayns and to the see appostolyke.


Of the .ix. sysme what befell
in that tyme.

SHamefull, cruell,  sclaunderous
out of measure was this .ix. iysme
* * * *  endured lo~ge tyme, whiche be|gan
in the tyme of lowys the emperour,
the stutter, the which occasion was this.
The bysshop Iohn~ the, viii, in Rome
borne, whiche fled in to fraunce for refu+ge
 socour, the which was a man cruel
 nothynge pyteous but malyciously en+treated
formosus bysshop,  so this for|mosus
for fere and daunger of the for|sayd
Iohn~ the .viii. bysshop, he fled in to
frau~ce. But afterwarde by constraynte
of excomunycacyo~s he was enforsed to
retourne agayne to his bysshopryche at
rome, called port romayne  afterward
was he degraded  deposyd,  made a se+culer
preest agayn to his formal state, 
sworne y^ he shuld not i~ nowyse retourne
to his bysshoprych. yet not w^tsto~dyng
afterward he was absolued by Martyn
bysshop of Rome the, xii, of y^ name,  in
short tyme af y^ sayd formosus bought
 papalyte y^ whiche another prete~ded to
 a romayne (which

coulde not as at that tyme obtayne it / yet
notwithstandynge afterwarde he obtay+ned
his purpose through a conspyrasy / 
mortall agaynst y^ sayd Formosus / and
so came in to Frau~ce to kynge Lothayr / 
and thus this sayd Formosus kept y^ po~+tifycalite
of Rome / fyue yeres  a halfe,
in the whiche tyme he dyd nothyng wor+thy
to be in memory, but ingendred ene|myes,
the whiche was reuenged of hym
after his deth.
After this Formosus bysshop, succe|ded
Steuen the .vi. of that name, there
was but one bysshop bytwen them both
which was named Boniface the .vi. bor+ne
in Tuskayne / whiche rayned but .36.
dayes. And so this foresayd Steuen the
vi. with all his power abolyshshed and
condempned all the Decrees and actes
of Formosus. And y^ next bysshop that
succedyd dyd clene contrary, and stablys+shed
and confyrmed them in theyr owne
formal estate agayne / whose name was
Romanus. And in lykwyse dyd Theo|dorus

and Iohn~ the .ix. bysshop / wher|by
arose great perturbaunce and busy|nes
amo~ge the people of Rome / for cau|se
some helde of one partye, and some of
the other. And so all this hurly burlye
was in faulte (none) but for lacke of
good vertuous bysshops of Rome, but
they were all poysoned. And yet after
this succedyd Sergyus afore named y^
came agayne out of Fraunce, whiche
was worse the~ any of y^ other afore hym.
This Sergyus the thyrde bysshop
of that name, retourned agayne in to
Italy, by the ayde and socoure of kinge
Lowys the thyrde, the whiche lowys de+posed
Chrystofer bysshop the, viii. that
after formosus vsurped the papalyte / 
the whiche Chrystofer was infected w^t 
sysmes that was bytwene leo the .v. of
that name and hym and so this forsayd
Sergius to be auenged of the forsayde
formosus, In his furye agaynst all hu|manyte
/ caused the body of formosus to
be dygged out of his graue / and clothed

hym agaye in his pontyfycalibus,  so
caused the hangman to smyte of his hed
and so threwe his body into the Ryuer
of Tyber, yet some storyes wryt that his
body was take~ vp agayne pryuely and
buryed by fyssher men.
This said sergius had a sone named
Iohan the .x. of that name bysshop of ro+me / 
whiche succedyd hym but not dyrect+ly / 
for there were two that possessed the
dygnyte afore hym, whose names were
Anastas the .iii. and landolphus. This
sayd Iohan the .x. was lytel better then
his forefather sergyus. Not withstan|dyng
he was a great warriour  a good
man of armes, for he droue the sarasyns
out of Calabre / by the ayde and helpe of
Alberyke marques of Tuskan / So in
conclusyon this wycked Iohn~ bysshop
onely to haue the name and renowme
of this sayd vyctory agaynst y^ sarazyns
caused the men of warre of Alberyke to
stoppe his mowthe with a cusshon /  so
smodred hym to deth / this trewely was

a pytefull case to se y^ see appostolyke / so
repleat with bysshops of iniquite as sto+yes
of y^ tyme doth wryt more at large
of theyr ambysyon, pryde, and iniquyte,
in the whiche season / the Hongaryons
wrought great vengeauncys / and dys|pleasurs
agaynst the church of Rome 
the patrymonye of the Church / whiche
was onely the iust punyssyon of God.


What befel in the tyme of the .x. and
the .xi. sisme by y^ power of the em|perour
Otton y^ fyrst of y^ name.
IOhn~ the twelfth of y^ name bysshop
of Rome /  also borne there, the whi+che
afore was called Octauyan thorow
the puyssaunce  tyrannye of his father
Alberyk, he vsed his papalyte very euyl
for he was a man of euyll lyfe, without
chastyte / he companyd w^t women open|ly
without shame / for y^ which abhomy|nacyon
two cardynalles dyscret  wyse
persons complayned vnto Otton empe+rour
of germany / who rained Anno .962

ye shall vnderstande that the meane sea+son
or Otton the Emperour came / this
foresayde Ingnomynyous Bysshoppe
Iohan, was aduertised of this co~playn+te
by the Cardynalles to the Emperou
of hym and caused the~ to be taken, and
of the one he caused to cutte of his nose,
and the other his brestys. And so shortly
after kynge Otton came to Rome and
there helde a counceyll agaynst the sayd
bysshop of Rome. In the whiche coun|ceyll
he was condempned, and deposed
for his wycked and cruell lyfe, yet after
this iust iudgement he was taken agay+ne
in the acte of adulterye with a ma~nes
wyfe whose husbande slewe hym with
the dede doynge.
After the deposytyon of this sayd Io+han
the, xii. kynge Otton caused a bys|shop
to be chosen called Leo the eyght.
And shortly after the absence of Otton
the emperour / The wycked Romayns,
sedytions inconstaunt, chased this Leo
bysshop out of Rome, and set vp an an|typape,

who was named, Benedictus / 
the .v. for the whiche cause themperoure
Otton shortly after beseged Rome / and
so what for the warre  famyne / the Ro|mayns
were constrayned to yeld and set
the forsayd Leo in his see, and auctorite
and so put to exyle theyr antipape Bene+dict / 
which fled in to Almayn thus were
these two sismes fynysshed afore wryte~.


Of the .xii. sisme abolyshed by
Otton the thyrde Emperour.
_BY the auctoryte of y^ empe|rour
Otton y^ thirde Anno
dn~i .993. was created bys|shop
of rome / gregorie y^ v.
borne in saxonia i~ Almayn
and so after the departynge of the empe+rour
Otton from Rome, a certayne sena+toure
ryche  repleat with couetous na|med
Cresse~sius, set vp y^ bysshop of plea|sau~ce
of the nacyon of Grece for money,
and so this Gregorye seyng  dredynge

the fury of the Romayns / and theyr vyo+lence
 w^t all fled into Almayne / towarde
the emperour Otto~ / who brought hym
agayne by stronge hande / though this
senatour w^t the greke bisshop antypape
with Cressencyus by force and strenght
kept theym within the Castell aungell / 
yet that notwithstandyng they were ta|ken
/ and Cressencyus was byhedyd for
his couetous enterpryse /  the antypape
had both his eyen put out, and wel wor|thy
for his ambycyous preesthode.
Thus was the bysshop Gregorye re|stored
to his dignyte in Rome agayne / 
and he was y^ fyrst that decreed  made / 
ordinau~ces for y^ elexcion of the Empyre
Anno dn~i .1002. to y^ entent y^ the elexcio~
imperyall shulde alway remayne  con|tynew
amonge the Prynces of Germa|ny,
whiche contynueth to this day onely
but of suffraunce, and so after Gregorye
held the see appostolyke / Syluester the
seconde the which was expert in the art
Magyque, and Nygromn~cy, whiche is

a deuyllysh  a da~pnable scyence / y^ whi+che
Gregorie dyed shamfully as storyes
maketh mension as in the seconde parte
of this boke it doth partly appere.


Of the .xiii.  .xiiii. sysmes in the tyme
of two bysshops of Rome / the one the
vncle, the other y^ Nephew / in whose
tyme Ierusalem was take~ by the
sarasyns  of y^ horyble opera|cyons
of these two bysshops.
THe knowledge of these dyuysyons
and sysmes be so confuse  odyous
that I wold they were passed vnder scy+lence / 
notwithstandynge he that seketh
for the swete breers / must oftymes passe
thorow sharp thornes  crowked breers
 or we come to the swet carnel / we must
pas thorowe the harde shell / thus after
these thyng afore resyted I must shew
vnto you the residewe as myne auctour
wryteth sucsentyfly as I may  can vn+dersta~de.
Thus haue ye sene y^ through
euyll  auarycyous bysshops of Rome / 

was the cause and occasyon of al sismes
discordes,  euylles that befell throughe
the world,  in lyke maner y^ good meke
and crystyan bysshops / was y^ occasyon
of peace, vnyte,  concorde, ouerall cry|stendome / 
as we haue wryten in the se|conde
part of this boke.
Thus after y^ this forsayd Siluester
the seconde dyed / whiche gaue hymselfe
to the Deuyll to come vnto his sayd dig+nyte
papall / whome God may saue by
his merry and grace / and in so succeded
in the space of .xii. yeres / but thre peasy|ble
bysshops of Rome / after this succe|ded
Benedictus the fyfth borne in Tus|kay
/ which began to entre in moch trou|ble,
for when the emperour henry y^ fyrst
of that name was deed / whiche was in
the yere of our Lorde .404. which stode
in great fauour with the sayd emperour
bycause he dyd crowne hym in his see / 
which benedictus was cast out by force
from his dignite by the Romayns /  so
they set in another in his place yet not|withstandynge

Benedictus / made his
agrement with his ennemies / and after+ward
chasid his ennemies out of his pla+ce / 
and so he was restored to his dignyte
agayne / thus fynysshed the .xii. sysme.
And as storyes doth specefy / which re+mayneth
that after the deth of the sayd
Benedictus / it was fantasyed that the
spryte of the sayd bysshop Benedictus / 
the .vii. appered vnto a bysshop in aso|lytarye
place vpo~ a great horrible blake
horse /  this Bysshop demaunded hym,
why  wherfore he rode on such a blacke
horse / he answered bycause he was in
great torme~tes /  prayed the Bysshop to
take certayne treasours that he had hyd
in dyuerse places / where as he shewed
hym where they lay /  y^ he shuld destry
buit the~ to the pore people / for all the al|mes
I gaue i~ my lyfe tyme lytle profyt
me bycause I gat my treasour w^t extor|yon / 
 rapyne whiche dyd as y^ vysyon
sayd  af he forsoke y^ glorie of th worl+de
 be came a relygyous man soletary.

After this benedict the .viii. succeded
Benedictus y^ .ix. bytwene who~ was the
bysshop Iohn~ the .xx.  this Benedict
the .ix. was worse then his vncle / as ap|pereth
for he was y^ occasion of the .xiiii.
sisme  diuision in y^ church of Rome for
the Romayns sawe y^ he was of smal re|putacyo~,
 of lytle valoure deposed hym
from his dignite, and set vp in his place
Iohn~ y^ archbysshop of Sabyn / whiche
was called Syluester y^ thyrde /  about
49. daies after they chased hym out also
bycause he was lesse then and an ydeot,
yngnoraunt  vnprofytable, but yet ye
shall vnderstande he perceyuynge this / 
solde his papasy to Iohn~ / for redy mo|ney
/ who was then achedeaco~, of saint
Iohn~ porte latyne / whiche afterwarde
was called Gregorye the .vi. for y^ which
sclau~ders  rumour among y^ Romains
then Henry y^ seconde of y^ name so~ne to
Conrad y^ rained Anno .1039. who cam
into Italy w^t a great army puisau~t, whe+re
he assembled a great cou~ceyl general / 

and so deposed these .iii. sysmatykes bys+shops
y^ is to wete / Benedict the .ix. syl+uester
the thyrde  Gregorye the .vi.  he
created bysshop of Rome, y^ bysshop of
Baynbergh in Almayne, who was na|med
clement the second / who was poyso+ned
by his successour Damascus the se|co~de
of y^ name also. And thus to com to
our purpose of the forsayd Benedictus / 
the .ix. which was the cause of moch euil
in the .xiiii. sysme /  solde his papalytye
some storyes holde this fantasy / or opy|nyon
of hym after his deth / was that he
appered in facyon of a straunge  won|derfull
lykenes monstruous and horry+ble / 
of whome was demaunded the occa+syon
of this wonderful forme / and state
myght signefye / he made answere that
thorowe the iuste iudgement of God / he
was thus condempned to be eternally / 
for bycause he liued so bestially in y^ sege
appoholyke,  thus through y^ turbaci+ons
of the wicked bisshops, the turkes 
sarasyns oppressed so cristendome  lost
the holy la~d w^t ierusale~ An .1012. y^ tyme.



Of the .xv. sysme appesed by the
emperour Henry the thyrde.
_THis tyme rayned emperoure
Henry the thirde in almayne
the whiche was Anno .1057.
began the .xv. sisme and dys|corde
in the Churche / y^ cause herof was
that after the deth of besshop Nycolas / 
the seconde borne in Sauoy / was elect
the bysshop of Luke borne in Myllane,
this man was chosen by y^ Cardynalles
of Rome /  they named hym Alexau~der
the seconde / this bysshop had a good 
vertuous name where as he was resy|dent
/  after his elexcyon y^ cardynalles
came to hym to accompanye his person
to Rome.
And so anone after his co~mynge to
Rome / certayne bysshops Lumbardye
coulde nor agre w^t hym / because he wol+de
not of theyr band and affynyte / wher+upon
began the .xv. sysme / bycause some
held opinyon and sayd that he entred by

symony (this preted) they thought to
haue one of theyr affinyte mete for theyr
purpose / through the inuestigacion and
counceyll of gylbert bysshop of parme
in lombadye, so these companyons car+dynalles
helde fast togyther as burres
in a cluster (and obtaynd agaynst hen|ry
the .iii. emperour to chose an other bis+shop
of rome in his place to theyr owne
purpose and mynde. And herupon the
Emperour  they accorded and so these
cardynals entred in to lu~bardye, where
they gdred a counceyll amonge them
selues, whom was co~sulted to chose one
named Cadollus borne in parme, mar+ueylous
ryche puyssaunt and peryllous
to the whiche all Italy were agreed,
This is cadllus chosen in the place
of the papall see, as an antypape and so
in short tyme drewe hymselfe towardes
rome with a myghtye power /  a great
armye of lu~bardys, agaynst alexander
bysshop of Rome who was acco~panyed
with a great armye of romayns in lyke+wyse

to withstande hym / and inconclu|syon
this batailles encou~tred, the which
was sturdy, stronge,  sharpe, vnder the
mountayne golde / where as was slayne
pytefully moche people / but in fyne the
victory tourned on Alexaunders syde / 
so retourned Cadollus vaynqueshed / 
yet notwithsta~dynge he lost not his cou+rage / 
but or it was a yere passed / thro|ughe
secret conspyresyes of some of his
affynyte / the which secrete companye he
obtayned by many within Rome / whi|che
ran sodaynely vnto armyes,  so by
Cincius saneofo the prouest of Rome / 
conuayed Cadollus in to the castel aun+gell / 
and so fynally byforce of his enne|myes
he was fayne to yeld / and pryuely
bought his lyfe of certayne souldyers / 
for .vi.c. markes and was orssed  flede
 so to please the emperour Henry the .3.
which fauored y^ sayd Cadollus / he cau+sed
a cou~ceyl to be assembled at mantua
to the which came the sayd emperoure 
Alexaunder bisshop of Rome / and there

Alexaunder pourged hym afore all that
noble presence to be clene of y^ cryme of
symony /  of ambysyon / and so the one
forgaue the other of all grudgs  thus
fynyshed the .xv. sisme.


Of the .xvi. sisme which arose by a bis+shop
of Rome / a blacke moncke / whi|che
bgan to lyfte vp his hornes, a|gaynst
the power of y^ emperoure,
wherof arose great euil  rumur.
WIhin a lytle and short tyme after
the .xvi. sisme folowed moch lyke / 
the other / for after the death of Alexaun+der
the second succedyd Gregory the 
borne in senys in touskayne by the po|curement
of y^ sayd blacke monke legal
in fraunce / which in contynent after the
elexcyo~ began a great discorde / bytwene
the bysshops of Rome, and y^ emperour,
which engendred great debates  mys|cheuous
euylles innumerable ouer all
crystendome as it shall appere herafter.

For in the tyme that this forsayd em|perour
was busyed / and had great to do
with his warres agaynst the Saxons
his ennemyes, this forsayd gregory bys+shop
of Rome / whiche was co~fyrmed by
the Emperour / for at that tyme no bys|shop
coulde be in Rome / without the ful
consent  confyrmacyon of themperour
and thus began this Gregorye the .7. to
sporne with an arrogaunt mynde / inhy|bytynge
themperour to medle with any
ecclesiastique auctoryte / vpon payne of
the hye sensuris and curse of the church
of Rome, nether that he shulde gyue nor
admyt bysshoprych, nor benefyce within
his Empyre / for they made pretens that
the Emperoure dyd sell the dignytes of
the prelacy in his Empyre / the whiche
this arrogau~t Bysshop wolde haue the
sale of y^ marchandise hymselfe as other
of his predycessours had done in tymes
past of auncyaunt institucyons / and of
ryght and olde customes.
These thynges were straunge newes

to themperour Henry / but that tyme he
fayned with a fayre cou~tenau~ce / bicause
of y^ great busynesse y^ he had that tyme i~
the warres of y^ saxons / yet notwithsta~|dynge
this arrogaunt bysshop left not
his purpose but procedyd agaynst hym,
 sent forth curses and exco~munycaty|ons
agaynst certayne bysshops that hel+de
with the emperoure / thus in shorte
conclusyon themperour had vyctory of
the saxons, and assembled in contynente
a generall counceyll in the cytie of wor|mys
vpon the ryne / and there was con|cluded,
that thorowe all his Empyre
that none so hardy shulde supporte any
Cardynall nor mayteyne courte nor co~|systory
that partayned to the see of Ro|me,
nor to any of his assystens, and thus
they shulde forsake them and obeye his
commaundemente and iniunceyons in
Almayne.
Uery longe  tedyous it were to this
abbreuyacyo~ / to excyte and set forth the
wonderfull feates of warre, with dyffe|rences

 alteracyo~s  appoyntement y^
were  happened bytwene this gregory
the seue~th  henry y^ thyrde emperour of
almaine, gregori gaue out a great curse
agaynst themperour  his bishops / and
themperour created another bysshop na+med
Clement afore called gylbrt arch|bysshop
of Rauena /  he was created
and elected by a counceyl in Germany / 
and this bysshop Gregory gaue his ty|tyle
to the duke of saxon named Radul|phus
/ but thus in conclusyon after .iiii.
bataylles faughten / he was co~uye and
slayne by the sayd emperoure Henry the
fourth. And after these vyctorys  crul
bataylles / this sayd emour se~t fyrst his
so~ne Henry y^ fourth to Rome to subdue
the pryde of this arrogau~t bysshop gre|gorye
the .vii. and of his adhere~ces / and
in this tyme / was there dame mehault
cou~tesse of Mantua / which was an Ap+postasa / 
an ypocryte / sturdy / and hady / 
more then became any woman / whiche
resysted themperour in y^ bisshop of Ro|mes

cause / whiche was also ouercome 
slayne, and thus this forsayd emperour
came to Rome byforce /  he brought w^t 
hym clement his antypape /  there co~se|crated
hym  was intronysed or crow|ned
/  so the bysshop Gregory y^ .7. whi|che
was the very occasion of al this mis+chefe
 euyll was beseged  afterwarde
escaped by the handes of Guyschard y^
normande prynce of poylle / whiche con+uayed
hym / yet notwithstandynge he ly+ued
not lo~ge after (for dolour  sorowe)
and this gregorye was he y^ made many
new  strau~ge co~stitucions, he ordayned
that prest shulde haue no wyues,  that
they  theyr wyues shuld not dwel toge|ther,
 y^ no man shuld here y^ masse of h
y^ held or kepe a co~cubine,  he ordayned
y^ no sone shuld ete flessh on ymber day+es,
 also y^ none shuld ere flesshe on y^ sa|terdayes,
 trouth to say this Gregorie
was to arroga~t  rigorus as storys wry+teth,
thus by y^ death of gregory y^ .7. the
16. sisme was almost abolysshed but not

all hole, for his successour named vyctor
the .iii. abbote of the mounte cassyn wol+de
gladly haue susteyned the same opy|nyons
whiche his predycessour helde a|gaynst
y^ emperour but he was soone co~+strayned
to y^ co~trary whiche dyed other
by preuy sycknes or by poyson /  after
hym succeded vrbanus the seconde whi+che
medled nor enterprysed lytle of the|se
forsayd matters, and so this man ca|me
in to fraunce, where was holden a
great counceyll generall at cleremount
in auernia, wherin he moued al chryste~|dome
to haue warre / agaynst the infyde+lys
and to recouer Ierusalem with the
holy la~de / by whose mocyo~ was gadred
vnyuersally throughe all chrystendome
the greatest army that euer went i~ to the
holy land / and godfray de bullyon was
the chefe captayne therof as apperethi~
the second parte of this boke.


Of the .17. sysme whiche arose by cer|tayn
quarelles y^ the bysshops of Ro|me
moued agaynst y^ emperours.

_PAscal the seco~de of his name
borne in tuskane was no les
then a dyscyple of Gregorye
the .7. which succeded vrban  the .2. yet he dyd no lesse then
his predycessours dyd / for he began his
quarell against y^ emperour supportyng
the papall dygnyte / so this mater han|gyng
Godfroy de bullio~ w^t al other cry|ste~
princes helde strong warre  batayls
agaynst y^ sarasyns in surrey, in y^ which
tyme they conquered Antioch and Ieru+salem
Anno di .1099. whiche was .492.
yeres after the sarasyns wan it fyrste in
the tyme of Heracle emperoure.
After this y^ forsaid pascal some what
hye mynded holdynge hye countenau~ce
agaynst Henry the fourth of that name
emperour, he sent his armie agaynst gil+bert / 
called Cleme~t antipape elect in Al|mayne
by themperour henry the thyrde
and this armye was wel enforsayd and
strengthed by Roger le Norma~de Pryn+ce
of Sycyl / which sent hym many men

of armyes,  also a thousande ouncys of
golde to mayntayne his souldyers w^t al
thus was this antipape for lack of help
constrayned to fle the cytie y^ he lay in, 
flede to saue himselfe into the handes of
Rycharde de Cha~payne of Napls, and
so after in short tyme he dyed for sorowe
and dyspleasure. This Rychard Erle of
Champayne in Naples, which fauored
this sayd antypape gylbert called Cle|me~t,
he set vp an other antypape named
alertus, borne besyde Naples, whiche
within short tyme was deposed / and the
inhabitantes of Rome / chose another
whose name was Theodorus, the whi|che
within a houndred and .v. dayes re|uoked
his auctorite  became an hermit
and so the thyrde was chosen called ma|ginus,
a cytazyne of Rome / whiche toke
the tytle and auctoryte of the bysshop of
rome at Raue~na / which was afterward
ouer throwen by the romayns.

And after al these thynges yet the for+sayd
Pascal bysshop the seconde of that
name recouered sertayne landes of the
church of Rome / byforce of armyes and
so he came into Fraunce to reforme the
churche.
 
Into Fraunce came this sayd Pas|cal
the seconde in y^ tyme of kynge phyl|lyp
the fyrst, and gathered a counceyl at+troy
in champayne /  it appereth in the
seconde part of this boke / for the refor|macyon
of the church / and so after this
sayd counceyll he retourned towardes
Rome / whereas Henry the fourth was
come afore hym / to be crowned empe|roure
/ where as this emperour toke pry+soner
this sayd bysshop Pascal / and all
his cardynallys, prelates,  curtasans / 
and so set them at lybertie agayne / whe~
he hadde recouered his ryght and tyt|le
/ that was taken from his predyces|sours
for admyttyng / the fre Elexcyon

of bysshops of Rome /  the fyrst fruytes
vnyuersal of the bysshops and prelates
and benefysed men / to be at the Empe|rours
pleasure, as his ryght  title was
and after y^ emperours departynge they
reuoked all that they graunted /  thus
was busynesse new to begyn agayne.


Of the .xviii. sysme
_THe .xviii. sisme began bytwe~
Gelasius the second bysshop
of Rome, borne in Gaiectan,
successour of the said Pascal
the seconde /  another antypape called
Benedictus a spanyard elected by Hen|ry
the fourth bycause of his tytle of elex+cyons
inuestures of the spyrytualtye, so
this sayd Gelasius came in to fraunce / 
and dyed at Clugny /  in his place was
chosen bisshop of rome calixt y^ seconde
archbysshop of Uyenne in Dolphyne / 
thus Benedict afore named antypape,
which held hymselfe stronge in Italy in

the spyte of the sayd Gelasius bysshop / 
and Calixtus his successour dyd in lyk|wise
withstande Gelasius to his power
but shortly in conclusyon he was vayn|quyshed
in playne batayl / and taken by
the ayed of the french men / and the cap|tayne
of theym / as the cardynall of sen
Grisigone /  so set this Benedict vpon
a camel  trussed his vysage / towardes
the camylles tayle, and so was led to ro|me
in dispyt tryumphau~tly with shame,
thus fynyshed the .18. sysme.


Of the .xix. sisme.
THus after the death of Calixtus of
Burgony / Honorius the seco~de of
that name borne in Ymola in Italy suc|ceded
the papasy / the which kept it pea|sybly
the terme of .v. yeres and died / and
after hym succedyd Innocent the seco~de
of y^ name borne in Rome / i~ whose tyme
began the .xix. sisme,  the occasyon ther
f was for raysyng warres agaynst Ro+ger

le Normande / whiche was called
kynge of naples / whiche withstode hym
with all his power /  so bytwene them
both was moche murther  blode shede
on both partyes, but in conclusyon this
sayd bisshop innoce~t was vaynquyshed
in batayle raygned  taken prysoner by
Wyllyam duke of Calaber / sone to the
sayd roger kynge of Naples,  yet was
he honestly entreated,  afterwarde dely+uered.
And so in the meane seaso~ that
this Innocent the seco~de the forsayd bis+shop
was prysoner / the romayns chose
another called Peter of Lyon sonne of
a myghty rych cetezyn of Rome / and he
was called Anacletus, for the whiche
elexcyon / Innocent was inforsed to go
into Fraunce for socours / and at Clere|monde
assembled the seconde counceyll / 
and another at Rayns i~ Champayne in
the tyme of kynge Lowys le grosse / and
from thense he came to Lyege / where as
he fou~de y^ kynge of romayns Lothayre
the seconde of that name, who promysed

hym assyste~ce with all his power /  thus
what by the helpe of the~perour Lothayr
and the french men, he retourned the se|conde
tyme into Italy, w^t great power,
whiche was Anno dn~i .113.  thus was
Innoce~t restored to his papacy agayne,
and Anacletus the antipape was depo|sed,
and spoyled of all his treasure and
reliqus of the Churche to paye the soul|diers
withal, wherfore he died for sorow
and dyspyte.
In certayne tyme after y^ bysshop eu|geny
the thyrde of y^ name borne in pysa
and afore a monke of saynt Barnardes,
one of his discyples / whiche came in to
Fraunce for two purposys, the one was
for the Ingerys and dyspleasurs of the
Romayns, the other was to monysh the
kynge Lowys to moue warre vpon the
turkys in the holy Lande / as it is more
playne in the seconde party of this boke
 gathered a cou~ceyll at vezelay, after y^
which tyme he returned to rome agayne
peasible w^t the help of y^ kynge Lowys.



Of the .xx. sisme whiche was in y^ tym
of themperour Frederyke the fyrst of
his name, called Barbarousse  this
sisme endured .xvii. yeres.
_EUen of the same roote  pre|syde~ce
y^ afore tyme hath gro+wen / 
y^ is to say for couetyse / 
which alway rayned in y^ see
appostolyk / such lyke causes engendred
this .xx. sisme / that is to wyt onelye / for
admyttynge the clergye in to benefyces
and possessyons /  who shulde haue the
fyrst fruytes / whiche began in the tyme
of Frederyke barbarousse Emperoure / 
whiche was a maruelous man  prynce
of slaueny / who maryed in the countesse
of Bourgonye / and bycause he had per|cyueraunce
 knowledge what ingeris
and displeasures, his pressssours had
in tyme passed with the bysshops of Ro|me
by vyolence and vniust cause / he con+ceyued
so greatyre, and displeasurs / a|gaynst
the~, for it that he scourged them

in suche wyse that there was neuer sen
so great dyuysion bytwene the Empyre
and the bysshops of Rome / in somoch y^
the consequence was yet wel worse that
folowed / for in the begynnynge of the
raygne of this sayd Emperour, whiche
began to raygne Anno .1154. this sisme
was begon bytwene Alexaunder the .3.
borne in senis, chosen and elect by the so+uerau~ce
of .xxiii. cardynallys /  an other
named Octauyan a romayne / whiche
was chosen by .3. cardynallys specyall
and named hym victor.
So this Alexau~der thynking to haue
good ryght / made a frend by an enbasse+tou
vnto the emperour Frederyke bar|barous
whiche as y^ tyme lay sege afore
the cytie of Cremona in lumbardy / and
that he shuld set adirexion amonge these
aypapes, the whiche Emperour to set
a vyte and concorde co~maunded them
both to mete with hym at payie,  there
he wolde mete with them / vnto the whi|che
Alexsander wold not consent, for the

which cause he abse~ted hym selfe ths 
so incontyne~t frederyke without aucto|ryte
assembled a cou~ceyl at pauye, where
the sayd Octauyan was present,  there
was decreed y^ he shulde posesse y^ see ap|postolyke
 was confyrmed mage the
wyl of alexa~der y^ thyrde. And i~ these cau+ses
the sayd Alexsau~der exco~munycated
the~perour frederyk barbarous,  so fre|derike
toke vp y^ patrymonie  profytes
of saynt Peter / otherwyse called the pro+fytes
of y^ church, for y^ which cause this
alexander fled from rome into frau~ce, in
the tyme of phylip augustus,  there asse~+bled
the thyrde counceyll at cleremound
in auernia as we haue expressed in the se+conde
parte of this boke, in the which
cou~ceyll Alexander the thyrde named by vy+ctor
antypape, excomunycated octauian
emperour,  in this tyme y^ emperour dis+comfited
millan  dertome, bycause they
were rebellyo~s,  after se~t an enbassade
to kynge Phyllyp to fynde the meane to
destroye this sysme then in the churche.

The place of this apoyntme~t was co~+se~ted
to be at dygyo~ in burgoyne / which
was Indyffere~t for both prynces / for y^
emperour frederyk lay on y^ borders of
burgoyne which came thyther w^t a no|ble
co~pany w^t his quene  the kynge of
boheme  with y^ kyng of scottes  theyr
Antypape w^t theym named vyctor w^t a
great no~bre of me~ of warre with the~ yet
wold not Alexa~der come there saye~g y^ /
y^ place was not indyffere~t for his perso~
nor yet co~uenye~t to kepe such a cou~ceyll
which only pertayned to his auctoryte / 
wherfore this vnworthy Emperoure w^t 
his antypape ful of yre  thretnyng / re+turned
into Almayne w^t great displeasu+re
 so when the forsayde antipape was
deed / there was created thre antipapes
successiuely one after the other,  by this
meane Alexsau~der was fayne to flye out
of rome to Uenyse in a strau~ge habyt,  i~
al this tyme was war thorow al chryste~|dome
 al by y^ occasyon of these sysmes
and errors y^ arose by these antipapes, 

stoborne bysshops of Rome /  fynably
the cytie of Ierusalem was lost agayne
in this season  wone by the turkes, and
sarasyns, also the sayd Emperour made
that tyme a great vyage in to Turkey / 
 a prosperous,  victorious, vnto his
death the whiche was great pyte / for he
was drowned in bathtynge hymselfe in
a ryuer / whiche was a great desolacyon
to al his armye / and a dyscomforte to al
crystendome so soudayne a chaunce.


Of the .xxi. sysme / whiche was in the
tyme that the court and see of Rome
was holden at Auynyon.
_CLement bisshop the .v. of that
name borne in burgony was
the fyrst that moed the see of
Rome to Auinion, as I haue
wryt playne in the second part of this
boke / and after the death of hym, the see
of Rome / stode vacant the space of two
yeres / thre monethes,  .xvii. dayes. For

bycause y^ cardynalles coulde not agree
at that elexcion and counceyl of carpen|tras
/ in so moche that they fell togyther
and fought / in the whiche arroure was
slayne two of the chefyste Cardynalles / 
and this hurle burley, in shorte tyme af|ter
they gathered a cou~ceyll at lyon, and
they held theyr co~claue within the black
freres called our lady of conforte, where
as they co~cluded to haue Iohn~ the .xxii.
of y^ name borne in Cauors Anno dn~i
.131. and some wryters say that he was
chosen by kynge Lowys, and Phyllyp
his brother kynges of Fraunce / and his
brother countye of poyeters.
After the coronacyon of y^ sayd Iohn~
the .xxii. of y^ name, he kept his resydence
in Auynyon, and for his fyrst acte he ex|ercysed
a marueylous iustyce / agaynst
Hewe bysshop of caours / the which bis|shop
was taken w^t a co~spyrasy / agaynst
the bysshop of Rome / Iohn~ .xxii. for the
which he was degraded / and delyuered

to the hangman / and cruelly put to deth
so in this meane season Lowys de baua+ria
kynge of romayns ouer came in ba|tayl
duke Frederyke of Ostrich, whiche
toke vpon hym bycause he had y^ corone
of myllan he wolde vsurpe thempyre of
Rome without auctoryte / agaynst the
whiche Iohn~ bysshop aforesayd / with|stode
with great indignation / with dy|uerse
censurys  curses agaynst y^ sayd
kynge of bauaria, which was called ny|colas
the .v. which caused the .xxi. sysme
which seassed not vnto y^ boniface coun|te
de Pisa toke prysoner this sayde an|tipape
/ the which raysed a great decyme
thorowe al the church of Fraunce vnder
colour to goo agaynst the sarasyns w^t a
hole crosse, for the which was money ga+thered
 he dyd pretend nothyng lesse / 
in this .xxi. sysme amonge the valdays
and y^ comons of Lyon / arose
and engendred many great
heresyes.



Of the two and twenty sisme longest
incontynuaunce / and most sclaun+derous
amonge all other / for
throughe it / the lande of
Boheme became full
of heresyes.
  
_THis .xxii. sisme contynued for+ty
yeres / in the which season
was many bisshops of rome
one agaynst another / whiche
was so obscure and crafty that al y^ clar|gy
in crystendome were troubled ther|with
/ to iudge to whome partayned the
ryght and iust tytle  who shuld possesse
the iust patrimony of saynt peter / called
these appostolyke / some sayd the one / 
some opynyon of the other, by the which
dyuysion the bohemes fel in great decay
and heresyes / as then it was taken and
called bicause partly it prete~did agaynst
y^ vsurped maiesti of y^ bisshops of rome

and agaynst theyr fylthy deceytfull c|uyousnesse
inuented for theyr owne lu|cre
for money / and pylled and robbed al
the worlde many yeres /  clene agaynst
all goddes lawe and holy scrypture / as
nowe it is euydently perceyued, that the
lyght is at his lybertye, and not darke|ned
as it was then, and these be the here
syes y^ the Bohemes helde as then, was
that y^ bysshop of Rome / was a bisshope
of no hyer preeminence / then other bys|shops
be / eche for his perticuler dyoses / 
also they held that there was no purga|tory
to be remitted by theyr power / also
that it was vayne and vnprofytable to
pray for soules ons passed this lyfe, but
helde opynyon that it was a profyte in|uented
by the couetousnesse of Preestes
onely for lucre / also y^ ymages of Chryst
and of sayntes, were not to be worshyp+ped
nor to stande in syght, for it was Y|dolatry
/ and also that all the orders of
Feres beggers was not of God / but in+uented
by the deuyllys crafte / also that

no preest nor bysshop shulde possesse no
temporalytes nother in auctoryte nor in
iurisdiccion / these were great heresyes / 
as y^ tyme required, as nowe many may
haue experyence.
And so to procede  come to our pur|pose
of the .xxii. sysme / it began the yere
of our Lorde a .1378. y^ was anone after
the court of Rome / was remoued from
auynion to Rome agayne, by the meane
of bysshop Gregorye y^ eleuenth of that
name borne in Limogis / as I haue wry+ten
more playnly in the seconde parte of
this boke / where as I wrote of two cou~+cellys
holden at Parys / in the tyme of
kynge Charles the syxt.
Thus that I may come directly / and
folowe the courses of these sysmes / Ye
shall vnderstand that in the yere aboue
wryten / the .xxii. sisme began in the tyme
of Gregorie the .xi. the which remoued y^
ee appostolyke from Auynion vnto ro|me,

then at y^ tyme the cardynallys were
deuyded in two bandys, or partys,  so
the cardynallys of Italy set vp Urban
the .vi. borne in naples / and the French
cardynalles, set vp Robert of Geneua / 
who was called Clement the .vii. and he
kept his see in auignion bycause of this
sysme, thus al cristendome was deuided
in two partys by the wilfulnesse of these
two monstruous Antypapes / beynge
a strau~g syght as it were a man to haue
two heddes / and so this sysme infected
the oryent partes of Italy, Almayne,
Hungory, which gaue obedye~ce to Urba~
the .vi. on the other part Frau~ce, spayne,
Englande, helde with Clement the .vii.
whiche was the occydent parte.
In the tyme of this great dyuysyon / 
Lowys duke de aungeoy, which fauou+red
bisshop Clement the .vii. which held
his aucorite in auynyon, and so entred
into Italy w^t .xxxi. thousande horse men
of armys / party for the Realme of Na|ples,
and also to socoure quene Ione

agaynst kynge Charles of Hungry, as
well as for the dyfference that was by|twene
the two bysshops aforesayd anty+papes,
 to thend to gyue cleme~t the hole
auctoryte, but in conclusyon, this sayd
duke of aungeoy so~ne of kynge Iohn~ y^
was prysoner in England fel sycke and
died within the space of two yeres in the
land of polonya, afore he had fynysshed
his sayd warres, for the which this sayd
french men departed thense into frau~ce
agayne,  this forsayd bysshop Urban,
yet coulde not lyue in peace with Char|les
kyng of Hungry and of naples, but
was constraynt to flee out of Rome, to
Gennes by see where as in y^ passage he
caused to be drowned .v. Cardynallys / 
whiche were great frendes of this sayd
clement in auynyon,  dyd fauoure hym
greatly,  thus this forsayd quene Ione
sold auinion  the cou~ty of venyse, vnto
Clement the .vii. but some stories wryt y^
they chau~ged for y^ tribuit, which y^ real|me
of naples ought to y^ church of rome.

For to retorne  wryte yet further of
bysshop Urban the .vi.  of the .xxii. sys|me
ye shall vnderstande that this sayde
bysshop as storyes do wryt was / a very
peruerse man, the which toke great plea+sure
to sowe discetions / and debatys
amonge crysten prynces soner  raither
then to set peace, vnite, and concorde, the
which dyscordys and debaytes were not
apeased longe after his death / and thus
longe endured this sysme / and so in his
place was chosen Boniface the .ix, borne
in Naples / y^ whiche was not aboue .30.
yeres of ege, and this bisshop boniface
was he that vsurped, and toke the aucto+ryte
from y^ Romayns /  so transported
it /  brought it to the set of the bysshops
of Rome / and so fortefyed the castel aun+gel
agaynst the Romayns / also this bo|niface
began to rayse y^ exactions vpon
the  / for al benefycys thorowe
all chrystendome (onely except y^ realme
of Englande) and in his tyme was the
gerat Iubelee vnyuersall.

So on the other part after the death
of lement the .vii. was chosen another
bysshop Antypape at Auynyon / by the
consent of the Cardynallys of Fraunce
called the bysshop of the mone / after na|med
benedictus the .xiii. against whome
was holden a counceyl in Fraunce as it
is wryten in the seconde part of this / the
which enforsed and enlarged this sysme
the which perceuered and contynued vn+to
the counceyl of Constaunce duryng / 
the whiche tyme this sayd benedictus of
the mone supported his obstynat plea|sure,
and so co~tynued in his wylfulnesse
vnto the ende of his lyfe.
Thus whe~ Boniface the .ix. was deed
in Rome afore wryten / the cardynallys
of Italy chose another bssshop of Rome
called Cosmian of Perouse, who was
named in the see of Rome Innocent the
vii. and after hym succedyd gregory the
xii. a venecian, somtyme called Angelus
be corario / thus worse and worse was

the sisme, for yet al this whyle rayned in
auynyon Benedictus of the mone / whi|che
held his ful auctorite as an antipape
vnto whome came as enbassatoure / the
duke of burgonye and of berry and orly+unce / 
from kynge Charles the .vi. the
which kynge desyred this bysshop of the
mone / to be perswaded from certayne
poyntes / the which he vsurped, and that
he myght be set in his ryght  iust aucto+rite / 
 also y^ the bisshop Gregory the .xii.
his felowe shulde do in lykewyse, vnto
the whiche this bysshop of y^ mone wold
make no auswere / but fled secretly into
spayne for fere of losynge of his dignite
and so y^ barons retourned with displea+sure
without answere /  there this Bys|shop
held a counceyl at perpignan / and
there held hym sure in a stronge castell / 
called Paniscolle.
Thus when the crysten prynces / and
cardynallys sawe that none accorde nor
appoyntement coulde come to passe / by|twene
these two / papystes bysshops of

the see of Rome / but contention  stryfe,
and that none wolde come to the ryght / 
thoughe they had promysed it afore / so
then was there gathered and assembled
another generall counceyll at Pysa in
Italy y^ yere of grace of our lorde .1408.
In the which cou~ceyl was a syted per+sonally
to appere / both the papystes bis+shops
solemply according to theyr estate
yet for all this they lytle regarded this
apperaunce, but held it as a scorne indy|rysion
/ the one as wel as y^ other / for the
whiche they were both depriued and de|posed,
 in theyr places chosen Alexsan|der
the .vi. borne in the yle of Candye / a
frere minor / the whiche lyued not after
full .v. monethes / and dyed in bollone le grasse / 
and after his tyme gregorye the
xii. whiche held hym in Austrych, yet not+withstandinge
he thought not hymselfe
there not in suretye / but he retourned a|gayne
into Italye,  there helde hym in
the cytie of Armyne vnder y^ proteccion,
of a baron named charles y^ euyl hedyd.

In this tyme all y^ possessours of the
church of Rome were redy in an vprore
and in armyes towards batayl / for this
Alexsaunder the .v. whiche had frendys
as y^ kynge of Naples / w^t dyuerse other
so this alexsaunder lyued not longe / but
after hym was chose~ bysshop a cardinal
of naples named Balthasar ossa / whi|che
was afterward intytuled / Iohn~ the
xxiii. and so in this tyme was in crysten|dome
.iii. antipapes / the one at Bollon
grasse / the other in Armyne / the .iii. in
the castell of Panyscole in Spayne / yet
notwithstandynge for the deposition of
these two bysshops at the counceyl that
is to say of Gregorye the .xii.  y^ forsayd
Beneict of y^ mone / all crysten nacions
consented vnto / except some of Spayne
and the ynge of Skottes, the which fa+oured
the sayd Benedictus of y^ mone.
And thus after this forsayd counceyl
whiche was gathered agaynst Gregory
the .xii. whiche came not personally / to
this counceyl / but sent his debytes duke

les euyll heddyd / lorde of Armyne with
other procuratours / and so contented to
resygne the ryght and iust tytle / that he
helde from themperour /  yelded vp his
dignyte papall in Rome / and put it into
the handes of the counceyl / and so fyna|bly
he was there created legat / and mar+quys
de Ancona where he dyed not lo~ge
after for sorowe.
Thus was these two stoborne anty|papes
consumed / so yet resteth the thyrd
ydoll and antypape / that is to wyte Be|nedictus
the .xiii. surnamed the bysshop
of the Mone / the whiche put this sayde
good emperour Sigismundus to moch
vnquyetnes and payne / for after the for+sayd
ydolles antypapes were deposed / 
and y^ this of the mone wold not come to
no appoyntement nor concorde / by no
perswasyon, then this sayd Sigismun|dus
themperour went personally to the
Kynge of Englande / and so retourned
by the kynge of Fraunce /  all this was
to set vnite in the crysten churche  con|corde

wherof he had good answeres, 
from thens went to Narbone to Fardi|nandus
kynge of Aragon / for the same
cause, al this was to perswade the styffe
obstynacye of the bysshop antypape of
the moone, the which fury coulde not be
ouercome by no maner of wayes  thus
this sayd emperoure retourned agayne
to the counceyl of constance, wher as he
depryued and deposed the sayd euyl bis|shop
of the mone, and so was there cho|sen
by the consent of all Chrystendome,
bysshop Martyne the fyfth of the noble
house of collonyois, a man estemed of
synguler vertue and prudent moderat
 iuste Anno domini, M.cccc. and .xvi,
and thus came peace in to the churche
and so ended this .xxii. cursed sysme.
This bysshoppe of the mone inconty+nente
after he was deposed by a hole ge+nerall
councey and depryued of his pa+palyte,
And so seynge that all his fren|des
were constrayned to forsake hym,

thus in conclusyon he dyed in his obsty|nacye
in the castell of panyscoll, And in
his restament charged his Cardynalles
to chose an other ydoll antypape in that
place, to succede hym / named cleme~t the
.viii. borne in barfylonne, and as the sto+rye
sayth he lyted reioysed of his dygny+te / 
for the forsayd bysshop Martyne the
fyfth helde and kept the see /  auctoryte
papall honorably / for al crysten prnces
and dukes held w^t hym as they had cho|sen
hym at Constauce / and so fynably
this Clement the eyght gaue vp his dig+nyte / 
and became bisshop of Maior.


Of the thre and twen|ty
sysme.
_Bytwene Felix the fyth and
Eugenius the fourth / fo|lowed
the thre and twenty
sysme / and this sayd Eu|geni
had great pleasures
in warres / he was a venecyan borne / 

as Platina historial wryteth of his lyfe,
which propryete is very strau~ge among
meke  good bisshops, for in his warres
he syted the Dolphyne of Fraunce, whi|che
afterwarde was lowys the eleuenth
kynge of Fraunce of that name, that he
shulde come w^t a great company of men
of armys to rayse and trouble the coun|ceyl
of Basyle agaynst Felix his aduer|sary,
y^ was chosen by the sayd counceyll
whose name was Ame duke of Sauoy
somtyme an holye heremyte / and thus
shortly to conclude this .xxiii. sysme that
which was bytwene Felix  eugenie whi+che
contynued .xvi. yeres tyll the deth of
of eugenius / whome succeded Ncolas
the .v. borne in the towne of sarasanne / 
in y^ lordshyp of luke sone to a physytien
who was chose~ Anno .1447. and at this
tyme the church was in diuysion in thre
partyes for the one alowed Eugenius / 
and the other Felix / and some neyther of
both and were not content with the one
nor with the other / and inconclusyon it

I make no mencyon / by|cause
myne auctoure leueth there at the

nor pleasure to wryte therof, bycause the

abuses and abhomynable vyces /  enor+mytes

bataylles, blode sheddes, luxury, symo|ny,
buggerys, treasons, poysons, with
in numerable vyces, to moch abhorryng

shal I say there is so many now lyung
that which haue experyence of the lye 
actes of some of these antecristyans bis|shops

in the tyme of kynge Henry the .viii.
And after hym Paulus y^ thyrde An|no
.M.ccccc.xxxv.  this Paulus was
the .cc.xxi. bysshop of Rome, in whose ty|me
now largly appereth the .xxiiii. sysme
which longe hath endured, and yet more
largely shall appere to the hye honor of
God / and to the great tranquilite of all
crysten regyons / for the which let vs all
gyue laudes and prayer to god, that an|techryst
may be knowen apparently in
his owne nature and kynde in the yes 

hartes of all crysten people / and that he
may be vtterly confounded with all his
assystence and adherentes tradycyons 
sectes, thus fynysheth this lytell abbre|uyatyon,
 foloweth the conclusyon of
the auctor.


Here foloweth the co~clusyon
of this boke.
_IT is to be vnderstonde that
thynges concernynge prophe+syes
and thynges to come, we
haue no certayne determyna|tyons
nor yet iust iudgementes of, as co~+cernynge
the veryte and trewth, yet it is
wryten y^ the world accordynge to scryp+tures
shall fynysshe by fyre elymentall.
Also it is wrytten in scripture / as the ap+pocalypsis
wytnesseth, that afore that
tyme Antechryst shall apere afore al peo+ple
and shall be knowen,  after the an|techryst
openly knowen / shall the great
and horryble sysme appere / the twenty
 four y^t which so lo~ge hath ben hyddyn

afore the people / for the whiche crystyen
kynges and prynces shal be in enforsed / 
and constrayned to set to theyr power to
resyst /  to st reformacyon in the church
catholyke vnyuersall, as it hath ben re|uelated
by inspyracyons  reuelacyons
dyuyne / as appereth by the appostles / 
prophetes / sybylles / sayntes / auncyent
astronomyers,  metamatisians, whose
inspyracions hath set furth a great part
of the co~mynge of such lyke thynges.
Yet notwithstandyng al such prophe|syes
and pronostycations / as hath ben
wryten / yet remayneth storyes and wry|tynges
of dyuerse and of many other ho+ly
persons dyuyne / which had reuelacy|ons
/ as these auctours folowynge boc|case
/ saynt vincent / de valentia / abbat
Ioachym of calabre / raymundus lulli
reuelacyons of saynt Brigit besyde cer|tayne
pagans / which I make no menti|on
of / yet notwithstandynge I wolde y^e

no person shulde obstynatly stande fate
in ony lyke prophsyes and sayenges as
an aricle of scripture nor to gyue fayth
there vnto none otherwyse / then the ca|tholyke
churche wyll it admit / and so a
all such sente~syes wryten and set forthe
in layne / to the intent y^ all people may
perceyue of whense they be  of whome
and so foloweth now the hole substau~ce
of all thynges / that is afore wryten pen|ned
and declared by the most noble ora|tour
mayster Alayn charter / whiche wry+tcth
this sentensyes worde or worde in
the end of his boke called Lxil, wherof
I do translate but a parte which is expe+dyent / 
and serueth for this tyme.
 
In olde tymes past was decreed in y^e
latyne church now called Rome as con|cernyng
y^ sacreed ordinau~ce of maryege
with y^ dignite of preest hode, which was
pretended vnder y^ coloure of clennesse 
chastite without spot, yet notwithsta~di~g

now is alowed y^ statute of co~cubynage / 
which is clene co~rary against al statut
decreed by goddes lawes or of clene ly|uyng
/ but rather folowynge al sensualy+e
 bodely lustes  pleasur /  it is to be
iudged y^ the makers of such statutes or
decrees were more apt vnto auice and
couetousnesse through the procuracyon
of symony with dyuerse other vnefull
wayes stryfull with processe corrupt as
by benefyces prelacions spyrytual / whi|che
ar defyled  spotted w^t wordly cures
busynes temporall /  thus largely wry|teth
storyes of the greke churche and the
latyne also as concernynge the ambyly|on
and dishordinau~ces of preestes  rely+gyous
persons / and men of the clargy / 
which was onely the cause of the sepera+cion
of the people of boheme, and also of
other nacions of the churches of Rome / 
what shall I meane of Boheme / none
other then al crysten regyons / for the pre+lates
of the church w^t theyr adherentes
hath so abhominably  fylthily enfected

not only them selues or theyr estate, but
al crystendome / y^ they haue gyuen occa|syon
to be disdayned of all crysten po|ple
/ both great and small / and to be hol|den
as straungers dishobedyent to the
holy catholyke church of christ through
the baroynesse / who were clene destiute
of theyr dyewty of clee  holy mynistra+cyon
 lyuynge /  haue set furh  vsed
all vnlawfull tradycyons  vayne lu|uryous
werk of badry and for cac|on
/ I may not wryt so large w^t my 
as I culde / onely for to vtter to moche
theyr abhomynacyon for ma~nes eres to
here or iyes to rede.
And yf I shulde say al that I thynke
I shulde say playnly the exesse and fat+nesse
of the goodes temporall medled w^t 
the hote sulfure of enuy / with the hete of
ambycyon and lechery / hath made them
redy to put the fyre into the Church / but
this matter is of to depe inuestigacyon / 
and y^ determinacio~s doubtfull, though
there be experyence and proffe therof y|nowgh

/ so w^t this I holde my peace / but
yet I pray vnto hym, which consecrated
our mother the holy church w^t his blode
(that which I do thynke folow not) py|te
hath caused me to wryt this, wherfore
pray we all to god, that al chrysten pryn|ces
may perceyue theyr dyewty regall / 
to set forth goddes worde prosperiously
vnyuersall accordynge to goddes wyll / 
and to reforme all such enormytes  ss|mes
/ which antechryst hath deceyued vs
by whiche we may auoyd to y^ hye
honor of God and tranquyl
lyte of all chrysten regy+ons.
Amen.
