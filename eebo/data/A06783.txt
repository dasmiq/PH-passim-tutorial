_OUre Lorde and alone
sauioure.Math. xiii Iesu Christe
declareth in a parable
of the gospell, that af|ter
a certayne houshoulder had
sowed good seede in hys fielde,
whyle hys seruauntes slepte, hys
ennemye came and sowed tares
amonge the wheate and wente
hys waye, Thys houshoulder is
Christ the lord. The good sede is
y^ children of god  gods worde.

The seruauntes that slepte are
negligente Prelates and sleepye
shepheardes, whiche watche not
ouer the Lordes flocke. The ene+my
is the deuil. The tares are the
children of the wicked,  errours
and heresies, which? Satan sow+eth
in the heartes, of the vnbele|uinge.
Of this parable as wee
learne the goodnes of Christe to+ward
vs in be getting vs a new,i. Peter. i.
not of mortal sede but of immor|tall
by the worde of God, whiche
liueth and lasteth for euer, so like
wyse learne we the maliciousnes
of Sathan, whiche lyke a subtile
serpente and olde enemye of ma~+kinde,
neuer sleepeth, but conty|nuallye
walcketh vp and downe
lyke a roryng lion, seking whom
he may deuoure and warely wat+cheth
hys tyme to destroye,ii. Pete. v. when

souer anye occasion is geuen, be
it neuer so little. Not wythoute a
great cause therefore did out sa|uioure.
Christ exhort vs to watch
and praye, that wee fall not into
temptatio~.Mat. xxvi. And albeit in this our
frayle and synnefull lyfe manye
occasions of doinge myscheife be
offered to the ennemy on our be|halfe
such is our negligence and
vncircumspecte behayoure, yet
the gratest occasion wherin Sa|tan
most gloryeth and soonest ho+peth
for the victorye, is when the
shepheardes of Christes flocke
giue no ate~dau~ce to theyr charge
but lye sleepynge and snortyng,
walowynge and welterynge in
theyr pleasures, and suffer the
wolf to scatter, yea to catch, to kil
and to destroye the shepe.Esaye. lvi. Ihon. x. For al+though
the deuil leteth go no pro+fer,

whiche maye moue him to do
euil, but laieth ha~d on it streight
waies, yet as the histories both of
the holye scriptures  of credible
writers do testify, he neuer shew+eth
him selfe so right a deuil nor
so liuely setteth forth him selfe in
his true colours, as whe~ y^ guids
of the Lords flocke be either ab|sent
fro~ their shepe, orels are neg+lige~t
in doi~g theyr dutie, I mean
in preching gods word,  in wri+ting
godly bokes, if nede require
for the confutacion of erroures
and heresies and for y^ establish|ment
of gods holi religion. How
sone had the people of Israel for
gotten god and his goodnes to|ward
the, after Moses was gone
from them into the mou~t Sina
to talke with god  to receiue the
lawe?Exo. xxxii Fel they not streightwaies

from the one and alone true and
liuing god vnto abhominable i|dolatri,
and worshipped a golden
calfe? After the daies of Moses 
of other godly Prophetes  prea+chers
when wicked kinges reig|ned,
and the preachinge of gods
worde ceased, did not y^e people of
Israel fal to the worshipping of
strau~ge gods,  made of the brase~
serpe~t (which was but a sacrame~t
and figure of Christe) a God and
brent sacrifice vnto it?Ihon. iii. iiii. re. xviii Certayne
yeres before y^e co~mi~g of christ in|to
this world, into how mani sec|tes
 so~dry religio~s were the Ie|wes
deuided amo~g the~ selfs, whi+che
not w^t sta~di~g cou~ted the~selfes
onli the people of god  hated al
other nacio~s, as abhominable I+dolatours?
Yea in the time of the
Apostles, were ther not y^ denied

Christe to be eyther true God or
true man? How sone wer the Cor+rinthians
and Galathians sedu|ced
by false Apostles, after that
the mooste worthye Apostle. S.
Paul was departed from them?
Howe many kynde of Heretikes
rose there vppe in the churche of
Christe after the Apostles tyme?
What greate and howe manye
contencions both in sermons, dis+putacions
and wrightinges had
the holye Bishops and godly fa|thers
of the primatiue church w^t 
the heretikes of theyr time for the
maintenaunce of gods truth and
for plucking vp y^ enemies tares?
Since the time y^t those verteous
Bishops and learned fathers of
Christs church died, into how ma+ny
sects haue the people y^ profes
god be deuided? The number of

sectes and counterfait religious,
which yet liue vnder the Bishop
of Rome, are almoste innumera|ble.
Neither ceaseth Sathan eue~
in this most clear light of the gos+pel
to play the right deuil, and to
cast mistes before the eies of the
vnfaithful. Into how many sects
is Christendome yet deuided? Ar
not some called papists, some pro+testants,
some Anabaptists, some
sacramentaries? Whence come
al these abhominacions but only
from sathan the author of al euil?
Moreouer in what fielde, where
good sede hath bene sowed, hath
not the ennemie sowed his tares
also? howe pestilentlye hathe he
corrupted the pure wheate of
goddes woorde wyth myngeling
hys chaffe, drosse, darnell, cockell
and tares, I mean the false glo|ses,

and vnsauery exposicions of
the papistes, Anabaptistes, and
suche other secaries? Howe wic|kedlye
hathe hee peruerted the
righte vse of the sacramentes, spe+cially
the sacrament of Christes
bodye and bloude? fastinge, prai+er
and almes deede, howe hathe
he made the~ to be abused? There
is no pointe of Christen religion,
which Sathan hath not attemp|ted
too ouerthrowe by hys mini|sters.
And albeit as I said before
the enemy laboureth at all times
to sowe hys tares in the Lordes
fielde, yet when the shepheardes
of Christes flocke be neglige~t in
doing their dutye, fal a slepe and
loke not to the Lordes field, then
doth he most of al play his parte
and bestoure him like a right de|uil,
as Salomon saythe. When

the preahing of gods word fai|leth,Pro. xxix.
the people pearishe. It ther+fore
becommeth al men that ten|der
the glorye of God, but specy|allye
the Lordes Ministers to
loke diligentlye vnto theyr lords
fielde, and earnestly to take hede
that the enemy sow not his tares
amonge the Lordes wheate. If
any be sowed, it is their duti to la+boure
euen to the vttermooste of
theyr power not with violence 
corporal armours (for the vse of
the seculare swearde is not com|mytted
to the preachers of gods
worde,Luk. xxi. Roma. xiii but to the temporal rulers
onlye to punysh malefactoures)
but with the swearde of the spirit
whyche is the woorde of God,Ephes. vi.
wyth prayers, supplycacions and
eares to weede theym oute.
The weapons of our warfar, sai+eth
S. Paule,ii. Cori. x. ar not carnal thin+ges,
but thynges myghty in god
to cast down strong holds, wher|wyth
we ouerthrow cou~sels, and
euery hye thyng that exalteth it
selfe agaynste the knowledge of
God, and bryng into captiuity al
imaginacion to the obedience of
Christe. And in thys behalfe, I
meane, in pluckinge vp the ene|myes
tares, and in purgyng the
Lordes fielde that nothyng may
growe therin but pure wheate,
your both godly and vnreastfull
paines (most reuerend father) a
well knowen in thys churche of
England, and thanckefullye ac|cepted
of all faythfull Christen
heartes, insomuch that very ma|nye
do daylye render vnto God
most humble and harty thankes

for the singuler and great bene|fites,
whiche they haue receiued
of him thorowe your vertuous
trauaile, in attayninge vnto the
true knowledge of iustification,
of the sacrament of Christes bo|dye
and bloud, and such other ho+lye
misteries of oure profession.
And al be it the deuill roare, the
worlde rage, and the hipocrites
swell at these your most Christen
labourers, whiche you willinglye
take for the glory of God and the
edifyinge of hys congregacyon,
yet as ye haue godlye begunne,
so without ceasinge continew vn+to
the ende.i. Peter. v. By this meanes shal
it come to passe, y^t when the cheife
shepheard shall appeare, ye shal
receiue an incorruptyble crowne
of glorye.
And forasmuch as so many as

the Lord hath appoynted watch|menne
ouer hys flocke, oughte
euerye one accordynge to theyr
talente to folowe youre Godlye
example in weedynge oure er|roures
and plantynge true and
Christen opynyons in the hear|tes
of the people, seinge that Sa+than
hath not a lyttle corrupted
the true vse of fastynge, whyche
beynge ryghtelye vsed doeth
hyghelye please God, and abu|sed,
displeaseth hym: I thoughte
it good agaynste thys tyme of
Lente, whyche of longe conty|nuaunce
hathe bene appoynted
to abstinence, to write some what
of fastynge, that myghte both o|penne
awaye too the faythefull
howe they maye faste to please
God, and also dysclose the falsse
manner of fastynge broughte in

by the deuyl and his Ministers.
And in thys my treatyse I haue
fyrste declared what the Christen
faste is,The Con|tentes of this boke. secondly how we oughte
to fast, and thyrdly what the true
vse of fastinge is. I toke thys la|boure
vppon me the more glad|lye,
partelye because no manne
hytherto hath writen of that mat+ter
in oure Englyshe tonge part+lye
to satysfye the heartye re|questes
of dyuers faithefull bre|threne,
whyche ceased not to re|quyre
me in the Lordes name to
wryghte some what, that myghte
enstructe theym in the true vse of
fastinge. The matter, I graunt.
requyreth a woorke manne of ri|per
iudgemente, and more exer|cysed
in the Lordes haruest then
I am, whyche myghte according
to the worthynesse of the matter,

haue set it forth pleasauntly and
learnedly, but seing no ma~ hath
hitherto take~ it in ha~d, I thought
it my part not to deny the godlye
requestes of the brethre~ but glad+ly
to bestowe vpon them what so
euer the Lord hath geuen me in
thys behalfe.
Thys treatyse what so euer it
is, I your humble and faythfull
seruaunt, not hauyng otherwyse
wherwyth to testify the thankful+nes
of my hart toward your most

A treatyse of
fastinge.
What the true and Christen faste is.

The .i. Chapter.
_THe true and Christen
fast is frely and willing+lye
to abstaine not only
from al kind of meates
and drynckes,The diffy|nicyon of y^ true fast. but also from all
those thynges, wherein the fleshe
hathe pleasure and delectacion,
whiche abstinence or forbearing
of meates, dryncks and other ple+sures,
wherein the outward man
deliteth, riseth either of an hearte
contryte and sorowefull for the
synnes commytted against god,
or elsse of a minde feruentlye ge|uen
to godlinesse.
That thys is a true diffinicion
of the Christen faste,The Fast of the Fa|thers of y^ olde lawe. it maye bee

easelye proued oute of the holy
scryptures. Fyrste to whome is
it vnknowen, that when the ho|lye
menne in tymes paste fasted,
theyr maner was, so long as the
faste continued, to abstaine from
al kinde of meates and drinckes
and from all pleasures wherein
the fleshe deliteth, and wholye
to gyue them selues (all worlde|lye
affaires sette aparte) to god|lye
exercyses,Spyritual exercyses in y^ tyme of Fasting. as to the heartye
and vnfayened lamentynge of
theyr synnes, where wyth to much
vnkindelye they hadde offended
theyr Lorde God, and prouoked
hys fearse wrathe and venge|aunce
to fall on them to feruente
prayer and diligente calling on
the name of God for turnyng a|waye
hys heauye dyspleasure

from theym, and for remission of
theyr synnes thorowe faith in the
holy sacrifice to come of that bles+sed
seede of the woman, which by
hys one and alone oblacion they
beleued, shulde reconcile manne|kinde
to God the father, pacifye
his wrathe, and make him a mer|cyfull
Lord to the hearinge and
readinge of goddes worde, to the
comorting of one another, to the
studie of amendemente of life, to
the prouisyon makynge for the
poore, to the redresse of abuses in
y^e common weale to the planting
of true godlines, and abolishing
of all wicked and straunge rely|gion.Ioel. . ii.
Of thys maner of fastinge
speaketh the Prophete when he
saithe, halowe ye a fast, meaning
that they whiche faste, shoulde in
the tyme of theyr fasting occupy

them selues in spirituall and not
in worldly exercises, or elsse is it
no faste before God.


The .ii. Chapter.
THis abstinence or forbearing
of meates dyd alwayes con|tinewe
at the least one whole
day withoute receiuinge of anye
corporal sustenance,Iudi. xx. many times
ii. or .iii, daies, as the historyes of
the holye scripture teach vs. The
Israelits, whe~ they sawe so great
a multitude of their people slain
of the Beniamites in the battell,
wente vp and came vnto Bethel
where the arke of the appoynte|ment
of God was in those dayes,
wepte, sate there praying before
the lord, and fasted the same day
vnto euen, and offered burntoffe
ringes and peace offeringes be|fore
the Lorde. Again,Reg. vii, when the

Israelites gathered together a
Mizpha, lamentiug their sinnes
and prayinge vnto the Lorde for
healpe againste the Philistines,
they fasted the whole daye. So
likewise did Dauid and thei that
were with him, when they heard,
that Saule and his sonnes were
slaine in battell.ii. Reg, i. Nehemiah fa|sted
two dayes together or moo.
For hee saide, as it is written of
hym.Esdras. i. I sate me downe and wept,
and mourned certaine daies and
fasted and praied before the god
of heaue~. We reade that Quene
EstherEsther. iiii and her Maidens wyth
all the Iewes that were founde
at Susan, fasted thre dayes and
three nightes together, and dyd
neyther eate nor dryncke. Mo|ses,
Elias and Christe fasted for|tye
dayes aud as manye nightes

wythoute receiuinge of anye cor|porall
foode, but suche fastes are
not to be practised, for asmuch as
they are maruelous and past the
bou~des of mens nature, and are
done onlye by the vnsearcheable
power and mightie worcking of
God in few of his creatures. But
the common manner of fastinge
among the true godly was, when
they did faste, to abstaine from al
meate the whole daie til nighte,
that they mighte the more frelye
gyue theyr minde to spiritual ex|ercises,
and at night to take some
refeccion moderatli yea and that
with thanckes geuing. And on
thys manner as some fasted but
one or .ii. dayes together, so some
fasted manye, euerye one as they
were moued by the spirit of God,
and as occasyon requyred.
We reade that the Prophete
DanielDaniel. x. fasted thus thre weekes
together. Hys wordes are these:
I Daniel mourned for the space
of thre weekes, so that I had no
liste to eate breade, as for fleshe
and wine there came none wyth|in
my mouthe. No, I did not once
annoynte myselfe, till the whole
thre wekes were oute. The scrip+ture
testifieth, that the vertuous
woma~ IudithIudi. viii. fasted al the daies
of her lyfe, excepte the sabbothes
and new moanes  the solempne
dayes, that the people of Israell
kepte. Likewise reade we of An|na
the Daughter of Phanuell,
whych departed not from the tem+ple,
but serued god with fastings
and praiers night and daye.Luke. ii. On
this maner did the Apotles after
Christes ascension  many other

godlye menne in the primatyue
church fast, So that their custom
was on that daye that they dyd
fast, to eat nothing til night, but
to occupy them selues about such
godlye exersyes, as here to fore
are mencioned.


The .iii. Chapter
ANd as the godlye menne in
the tyme of theyr fasting did
abstayne frome meate and
drincke, so dyd they from al other
thynges that myghte delyte the
fleshe, and be haued them selues
outwardlye accordinge to the so|rowe
and trouble of their hearte
inwardlye. Oute of a mourning
and soroweful hearte dyd spring
outwarde yea and those vnfaye|ned
tokens of sorowe and mour|nynge.
For wee hearde before,
that when Daniell fasted three

weekes, and prayed vnto the
Lorde hys God, although he did
eate bread euerye nyghte for the
comforte of hys weake body, yet
he neyther eate flesh, nor dronck
wyne, nor yet once anoynted hym
selfe.Daniel. x. And in a nother place he sai+eth:
I turned me vnto God the
Lorde for to praye,Daniel. ix. and to make
myne intercession wyth fastyng,
sakcloth and ashes.Ionas. iii. The people
of Niniue, when they hearde the
preachynge of Ionas, whyche
threatened them and theyr cytye
destruccion after fortye dayes,
repented, beleued God, and pro|claymed
fastyng, and arayed the~+selues
in sackeclothe, as well the
greate as the small of them. And
when the tidyngs came vnto the
king of Niniue: he also arose out
of his seate,  dyd his apparel of

and put on sackeclothe, and sate
hym downe in ashes.ii. Esd. ix. Agayne,
the chyldren of Israell (as wee
reade in Esdras) when they fa|sted,
dyd put on sackeclothe, and
sprinkled earth vpon theyr hea|des,
knowledged theyr synnes,
prayed vnto God, and redde in
the booke of the lawe of the Lord
theyr God.Ether. iii Quene Esther also
when she fasted, layed awaye her
glorious apparel, and put on the
garmentes that serued for sygh|yng
and mourning. In the stede
of precious ointment, she scatte|red
ashes and donge vpon her
heade, and as for her bodye, shee
hu~bled it with fasting,  brought
it verye lowe. Lykewyse kynge
Achab, whe~ he was reproued of
the Prophete Helyas for kyl|lynge
Nabothe, fell to fastynge,iii. e. xxi.

and as he fasted, so dyd he putte
sake cloth about hys flesh, lay in
sackclothe, wente barefoote and
hangyng downe hys heade.


The .iiii. Chapter.
VUhat so euer myght make
to the hu~blyng and taming
of the flesh, that dyd the god+ly
men vse for the moste parte in
the tyme of theyr fastynge. Ney|ther
dyd those corporal exercyses
displease God, seynge they came
from a co~trite hart and troubled
spirit, wholye dependynge wyth
strong faith on the great mercies
of God. For Dauid saith: A trou+bled
spirit is a sacrifice to God,
nether doth he despise a contryte
and hu~bled hart.Psalm. li. But these out|ward
sygnes of humiliacio~ God
vtterly abhorreth, whe~ they come
not from a penitent and faythful

hart, and casteth them awaye as
hypocrytysh and diuelish, as we
read in the Prophet Esay,Esai. lviii wher|fore
fast we, saye the hipocrites,
and thou O God seest in not? We
put our liues to straightnes, and
thou regardest it not. Behold, sai+eth
God, when ye fast, your luste
remayneth syl, for ye do no lesse
vyolence to your debters. Lo, ye
faste to stryfe and debate, and to
smite with the fyst of wickednes.
Now ye shall not faste thus, that
your voice might be herd aboue.
Thyncke ye thys faste pleaseth
me that a man shuld chaste~ hym
selfe for a day, and to wrythe his
head about like an hoope,  to lie
vpon the earth in an heary cloth?
Shuld that be called fastyng, or
day that pleaseth the lord: Doth
not thys fastynge rather please

me, that thou loose hym oute of
bondage that is in thy daunger?
that thou breake the othe of wic|ked
bargaynes? that thou let the
oppressed go free, and take from
them all manner of burthens? to
deale thy breade to the hungrye
and bryng the poore wandering
home into thy house? when thou
seest the naked, that thou couer
hym, and hyde not thy face from
thy neighbour, and that thou dis|pyse
not thyne owne eshe? (If
thou thus fastest) then shall thy
lyght breake forthe as the mor|nynge,
and thy healthe flooryshe
ryght shortlye, thy ryghteousnes
shal go before the, and the glory
of the Lorde shall embrace thee.
Then if thou callest, the Lorde
shal aunswer the, yf thou cryest,
he shall saye, here I am, Yea yf

thou layest awaye from thee thy
burthens, and holdest thy fyn|gers,
and ceacest from blasphe|mous
talkyng, yf thou hast com|passion
vpon the houngrye, and
refreshest the trubled soule, then
shal thy lyght spryng oute in the
darknes, and thy darknes shalbe
as the none day. The Lord shall
euer be thy Guyde, and satysfye
the desyre of thyne hearte, in the
tyme of drouth, and fil thy bones
wyth mary. Thou shalt be like a
fresh watered garden,  lyke the
the~ fou~tayne of water that neuer
leaueth running. Againe, God
saith by the prophet Iol,Ioel. ii. turne
you vnto me w^t al your hert, with
fasting, weping, and mourning,
teare your harts  not youre clo|thes.
Moreouer albeit S. Paul
councelleth that maryed folke

should not wythdrawe them sel|ues
one from another any longe
tyme,. ori. vii. lest Satan tempt them to
incontinency and vnclennes, yet
y^ they myght be the more apt to
fast and to pray, he woulde haue
them sometyme to withdraw the~
selues one from another. Here|vnto
pertayneth the sayinge of
the Prophete Ioel: Blowe oute
wyth the trumpet in Syon, pro|clayme
a fasting, cal the congre|gacion,Ioel. ii.
aud gather the people to+gether
warne the congregacio~,
gather the elders, bryng the chil+dren
 suckelyngs together. Let
the bridgrom go forth of his cha~|ber,
 the bryde out of her closet.


The .v. Chapter.
THus haue we learned out of
the holye Scriptures,The true Fast. that
the true and Christen fast is

to abstayn not only from al kind
of meates and drinkes (durynge
the tyme of fastyng) but also fro~
al those thinges wherin the flesh
hath pleasure and delectacion, 
to occupy our selues in all godly
and spiritual exercyses vnto the
glory of God, the comfort of our
neyghbour, and the helth of our
own soules.Constrai|ned faste please not God. But it is to be noted
that thys abstinence or fast must
be frely and wyllynglye done, or
els canne it by no meanes please
God. For what so euer commeth
from an vnwilling and constrai|ned
mynde, God abhorreth, ap|pere
it neuer so godly and praise
worthye before the worlde. God
loueth a cherefull geuer,ii. Cori. ix. sayeth
Saynte Paule. And the Psal-inographe
sayeth:Psal. liii. An offerynge
of a free hearte wyl I gyue the,

and prayse thy name, O Lorde
because it is so co~fortable. They
therefore that faste for custome
sake or at the commaundemente
of man onlye, and not of a good
wil and fre spirit, do nether please
God,Iere. xiiii. nor profit the~selues. Ther|fore
shal that chaunce vnto them
that God threatneth by the Pro|phet,
sayinge: When they fast I
wil not heare theyr praiers.


The .vi. Chapter.
HEare peraduenture some
manne wyll saye, Is it vn|godlye
to faste at the com|maundemente
of manne?Fasts com+ded of the hyghe powers. What
if the Magistrates cause a faste
to be proclaymed? Ought it not
to be obserued of theyr subiects?
I aunsweare. If the hye powers

A troubled spirite is a sacri|fice

as the holye Scryptures do de|clare,
and therefore dydde they
hyghlye please God, in so muche
that God graunted theym theyr

hereof are the Israelytes,

that were gathered together a
Mispha, the Niniuites, Either

citisenses of Bethulia, Achab, 
diuers other, whose fasts God al+lowed
because they proceded fro~

NOwe as touchinge that fast

not be disalowed of God. For hee

labouringe canne not but please
God, and haue good and fortu|nate

Daniell,Daniel. ix that he myghte be
the more apt to receiue the know+ledge
of goddes misteries, which
were afterwarde declared vnto
hym of the aungel. So lykewise
dyd Esdras.iiii. Esd. v Of thys godlie ma~|ner
of fastynge spake Christe,Math. ix.
whe~ the Disciples of Ihon came
vnto hym. and demaunded, whye
hys Disciples fasted not, as
they and the Pharises dyd. To
whome Christe aunswered and
sayde. Canne the brydegromes
chyldren mourne so longe as the
brydegrome is wyth theym? But
the dayes wyll come, when the
brydegrome shall be taken from
them, and then shall they faste.
Accordynge to thys Prophecye,

when Christ, whych is the bride|grome
was taken from them, I
speake concernynge hys corpo|ral
presence (for by hys spirite he
is wyth the faithful vnto the end
of the worlde) they mourned, fa|sted

that by theyr preachynge manye
thousandes myght be conuetted

of the Pharise is, of the Sa+duces,
of the Essees, and the late
sprong vp religion of the Chri|stians
humbled hym selfe in the
syghte of God, mourned, fasted,

woulde please God to declare
vnto hym, whych amonge theym
al was the true relygyon that he
myght obserue the same, frame
hys life according vnto that, and
so please God. And to obtayne
thys thing of God, he continued
long fastyng and praying. God

therfore accepted hys fast, heard
hys prayer, and graunted hym
hys request. The Prophets and
Preachers at Antioche,Actes. xiii. fasted 
prayed, that bothe they them sel|ues
might preach wyth frut, and
that other also myght be sente of
God, and appoynted vnto that
offyce, that the glorye of God
myght be set forth, that his word
myght be receaued, and that all
nacions of the earth myghte be|leue
in hym, and in hys Sonne
Iesu Christ. Theyr fastyng and
praying wer alowed before god,
and theyr desyres were fatisfied.
For the holye ghoste sayde vnto
them, separat me Barnabas and
Saule for the woorke, whereun|to
I haue called them. And when
they had fasted and prayed, and
layed their handes on them thei

lette them go. Paule and Bar|nabas
also fasted when they prai+ed
for the congregacions of Li|stra,Actes. iii.
Iconium, Antioche and Pi+sydya,
and when they ordayned
them elders in euery congrega|cion
to teache and instructe them
in their absence, and to confirme
them in the faythe and doctryne,
whiche they had all readye recei|ued.
And God gaue good succes
to theyr doctryne and ministraci|on.
Al these fasted of a minde fer|uentlye
geuen vnto godlinesse.
Hitherto haue we learned oute
of the holye scryptures, what the
true and Christen faste is. Nowe
let vs se in fewe woordes, whe|ther
the Popyshe manner of fa|stinge,
whiche we haue so manye
yeares vnfruitefullye obserued,
be lyke vnto that trade of fasting

which we haue so many yeres vn+fruitfully
obserued, be lyke vnto
that trade of fastinge, whiche the
word of God hathe painted and
setforthe vnto vs.


The .ix. Chapter
THe true and Christen fast is
done frely and willingli,Of the po+pish man|ner of fast+ynge. and
commeth fro~ the feruent mo|cion
of the spirit. The popish and
supersticious faste serueth the cu+stome
onli, and is done at the com+maundeme~t
of man with a grud|gynge
and vnwillinge mynde,
which beinge lothe to faste if the
custome  mans ordinaunce wer
not, wisheth both the fast and the
commaunder of the fast at the de|uil.
And if any in so great a mul|titude
do willinglye fast, yet is it
done partly to satisfy the custome
partly because they wil be cou~ted

good deuout  catholike me~, part+ly
to honour some sainct, partli to
deserue remiscion of theyr sins, 
to win euerlasting life. Can thys
kinde of fasting plese god?Math. xv. They
worship me in vain, saith Christ,
teachinge doctrines that are the
co~maundements of men.Rom. xiiii Sainct
Paule also saith, Whatsoeuer is
not of faith is sinne.
The true  christen fast, during
y^ time of fasting is to abstain fro~
al kinde of meates  drinkes (ex|cept
very necessiti requireth y^ co~+trary)
 fro~ al those things, wher
in the flesh deliteth. For y^t was y^
maner of fasting amo~g y^e fathers
of the old law, as we herd afore,
Hierome confirminge the same:Lib. ii. |tra Iouin anum.
The Iewes, saithe he, on those
daies y^t they fast, toke nomeat, til
they se y^e euening star vp. And a
certain cou~cel called Concilium

Calcedonense, ordained, y^e suche
shuld not be counted to faste, that
dyd eate before euensonge was
done, whiche at the time was not
celebrated, as it is nowe at .ii. or
iii. at the clocke after dinner, but
at nighte aboute the .viii. or .ix.
houre, when the day was al past.
The popish and supersticious
fasters perswade them selues to
fast wel, and to do a meritorious
dede, if they onli abstain fro~ flesh
though in y^e morninge so sone as
they rise out of their beds,O worthy Fast. they en+farse
 stuffe their belies with as
manyfine cakes  tostes of whit
bread as they be able to eat, and
 w^t asmuch good aleful of spices
or els burnt Maulmesy, as theyr
pau~ches can hold. And when din+ner
come, if thei abstain fro~ a smo+ky
peace of Bacon or hard salted

and poudred biefe or suche lyke,The Pa|pists drin|kyng in y^ mornyng.
though they eate the most delici|ous
fishes that can be goten, and
enfarse their beastly bodies with
al the swete meates that ca~ be in+uented
 sought out, yea  that so
vnmeasurably, y^t after they haue
once dined, they are prouoked ei+ther
to the pleasure of the bodye,The Pa|pists man+ner of dy|nyng.
or els like beasts of the blly fall
straightwais vnto slepe, so y^t thei
ar not hable to serue god, nor the~
selfs, nor ani other, yet thinck thei
y^t they fast wel and do god a great
plesure.A story of a Monke wych was a great fa+ster. This maner of fasting a+mo~g
many other vsed a certayne
monke in my cou~try, which not w^t
standing was cou~ted the greatest
 deuotest faster in al those qua+ters.
His maner was for the most
part to make but one mele a dai,
as they vse to say, yet such a mele

as the meat of y^t one mele might
haue semed sufficient to any rea|sonable
creature to haue serued
vi. godli fasters at a mele. Whe~
he came vnto Dynner and was
set down at the table, his vse was
euer to vnbuckle and let slacke
his girdle a great quantitie, whi+che
before was streight girded to
his bodi. He fel to his meat, as the
hongry wolf to his pray, and ne|uer
leafte of deuouringe the best
meates that wer set before hym,
till he had so stuffed hys relygy|ous
paunche, that his girdle be|ing
afore lose, was so hard to hys
body, that he could not put his lit|tle
finger betwene the girdle, 
his clothes. He sate so swelling 
sweting at the table thorow y^e to|much
deuouringe of pleasaunte
meats  whot wines, y^ if Apelles
had bene present with his pensil
he might haue had a ioly paturn

o paint a right Epicure. And not
withsta~dyng both he  such lyke
wer counted good, holy, deuout,
religious  catholik fasters. To
consume at one di~ner so much as
wold serue thre, was no breaking
of a fast. To deuoure vnmesura|bly
al kinde of pleasaunt fishes,
or whatsoeuer deinties besydes
could be deuised, was fast good
inough in y^ popes kingdo~, but to
eate a peace of flesh although ne+uer
so grosse, was twise a deadly
sin,  punished w^t fire. The eater
of y^e flesh was called a Lollore, 
adiudged to be bre~t w^t fire for his
I know not how great offe~ce, as
though god abhorred more the
eating of flesh then of fishe, or as
though fish wer cleane in y^e sight
of god,  flesh vile  abhomina|ble.Mat. xxiii
O belied hipocrites whiche
strain out a gnat  swalow doun

O spirits of errour and teachers
of Diuelishe doctrynes,. Tim. iiii. whiche
speake false thorow hipocrisie, 
haue their conscie~ce marked with
an hote yron, forbiddinge to ma|rie
and commaunding to abstain
from meates, whiche God hathe
created to be receiued with than|kes
geuinge of the~, which beleue
and know the truth. For al y^ cre|atures
of god are good, and no|thing
to be refused, if it be recey|ued
with thanckes geuing. For
it is sanctified by the word of god
 praier.ilus. i. Unto y^e pure al thgi~s ar
pure but vnto the~ y^t are defiled 
vnbeleuing is nothing pure, but
euen the minde and conscience of
the~ is defiled. Why do not those
blind guides remember this say|ing
of our sauiour Christ,Math. xv.  cease
to condemne the innocent? That

which goeth into the mouth, def+leth
not y^t man, but y^ which com|meth
out of the mouth, defileth y^
man. For what so euer entreth in
at the mouth, goeth into the bel|li
and is cast out into y^e draught,
but those thinges which procede
out of the mouthe, come from the
hart,  they defile y^ man. For out
of the hart procede euil thoughts
murders, breaking of wedlocke,
whordomes, thefes fals witnes,
blasphemies, These are the thin|ges
whiche defile a man.


The .x. Chapter.
AGaine at night albeit the po+pish
fasters eat no meat,The Pa|pysts drin+kyng at nyght. yet
make thei such a drinki~g, as
might iustli seme a costious kind
of ba~ketting. Besides their white
bread  fine cakes, thei haue their
figges, reasons, almonds, aples,

peares, nuts, carowis, biskits, su+cat,
marmilado, cherise condite,
quinches condite,  I know not
what. And besides their nappi ale
and heady beere, they haue sun|dry
wines, some spiced,  som bre+wed
w^t a cup of Ipocras at y^ lat|ter
end to make vp their mouthe
withal and to finishe theyr holye
and religious fast. Is it not to be
thought, y^t these men take great
paines in their fasti~g? do not such
fastes please god greatly thinke
you? O abhominable mockers of
christen abstinence. Theese are
those Epicurcs, whych as y^e Poet
saith, Curios simulant et bacchanalia ui|uunt.Mat. xxiii
These are those hipocrites,
which bind heaui burdens  gre+uous
to be born,Luke. xi.  lay the~ on me~s
shoulders, but they the~ selfs wyl
not heaue at the~ with one of their

figers. And as y^ welthi worldli~gs
 rich Epicures thinck the~ selues
to faste wel, if they make but one
mele on y^ day, though otherwise
they enfarse their bellies with ne+uer
so mani deinties, euen so iudg
the baser kinde of people, y^t they
fast wel, if thei eat no meat, though
they stuffe their pau~ches with ne+uer
so much bread  drinke. No|table
is this sentence of .s. Hiero~
against al such belli gods. What
auaileth it, saith he, to eat no oil, 
to seke about for such meates as
are most deinty  hardest to come
bi,Ad Nepot as dry figs, pepper, nuts, dates
sine cakes, hony,Pistaciu~, is a kynde of Nutte  pistacies? All
the deinties that gardens canne
bring forthe are soughte, that we
shuld not eat y^e vsual bread. And
while we seke deliciously to lyue,
we ar plucked back from the king+dom
of heaue~. Moreouer I hear

say, that ther be some which con|trarye
to the rule and nature of
men,Nyse and fyne Fa|sters in S. Hieromes tyme. drynke no water, nor eate
bread, but soupe not out of a cup
but out of a shel deynty brothes,
and herbes brayde, and the iuce
of Beetes. Fye for shame, are we
not ashamed of such fo~dnes, nor
wearye of the supersticion? Yea
we liuing in al deliciousnes, seke
to be praysed for our abstinence.
The myghtiest fastis water and
bread, but because it hath no glo+rye
nor notable fame,  because
we al liue with bread  water, it
is not cou~ted as the publyque 
co~mon fast. Wold God y^t al they
that fast, yea  so many as profes
Christ wold reme~ber  co~tinual|ly
set before their eyes thys say|ing
of s. Auste~.Erser. lvi Detempo+te. It nothing profy|teth,
sayeth he, to haue passed an

whole day in lo~g fasting, if after+ward
the soul be oppressed wyth
dylyciousnes or superfluitye of
meates, for so is the minde much
filled, soone dulled, and the erth
of our body so watered, wil bring
forth thornes of wicked lusts. Let
therfore our meate be temperate
 no more then is sufficient,  let
our belly neuer be to ful. And let
vs alwayes haue more mynd of
the meate for the hearte, then of
meate for the body, because with
in the inward man we be made
after the image of God, but in
the flesh we are fashioned of the
slime of the earth.


The .xi. Chapter.
FUrthermore the Christen fast
ryseth of an hart contrite and
sorowful for the sins co~mitted
against God, as we haue heard

heretofore. The popish faste ry|seth
either of custome or els of su+persticyon.
For the Papystes in
theyr chiefe  solempne fastinge
dayes are led wyth no true feare
toward God, neyther do they la|ment
theyr syns, nor study by har+tie
repenta~ce, true faith  amend+ment
of life to apease the wrathe
of God kindled against them for
their abominable liuing on those
dayes that they fast, more them a+ny
other tyme. What Papiste a|mong
them forsaketh hys papi|stry,
hipocrisy, supersticion, and i|dolatry,
and gladly receiueth the
truth of Gods word? What coue+uetous
worldling leaueth his co+uetousnes
 exerciseth mercy to|ward
the pore me~bers of Christ?
What proud ma~ giueth ouer his
pride, and embraceth humilitie?

What adulterer forsaketh hys
adultri, and leadeth an honest co~+uersacion?
what gloton or dron+kard
giueth ouer hys glotony or
dronkennes, and leadeth a sober
lyfe? what vsurar leaueth his v|sury?
what briberer his brybery?
what catchepole hys extorcion?
what tirante hys tirannye? what
whore her whoredome? what ry|balde
hys rybaldrye? what blas|phemer
hys blasphemy? what en+uious
man his enuy? c. As they
begin their fast w^t an vnrepen|ta~t
 wicked hert, euen so do they
continue  end the same, so far is
it of, that they haue any sorow in
their heart for their syns commit+ted
against God, whych shoulde
earnestlye moue them to forsake
theyr meate, and to giue them sel+ues
wholy to be reconciled vnto
god by repentynge and callyng

on the name of God for mercy in
Christ Iesu our lord. Their fast
therfore is abhominacion before
God, forasmuch as in the time of
theyr fastyng they gyue not ouer
theyr wyckednes, and earnestlye
seeke to please God.
Moreouer the Christe~ fast ri|seth
also of an hert ferue~tly geue~
to godlynes. In thys behalfe al+so
y^ popish fast agreeth nothing
with Christe~ abstinence.In what the ynges of y^ papistes consisteth. For the
Papystes myndes are set on no
true godlines in the time of their
fastyng, but altogether on super+sticion
 hipocrisie. Theyr god|lynes,
yea rather vngodlynes,
when they fast, consisteth in obser+uyng
the popes ceremonies and
mans inuencions. If they fulfyl
those, they thynke the~selues god+ly
ynough, when notwithsta~ding

they e furdest from all true god
lines. Nether do they direct their
fastes vnto anye godly end, but
as eueri one antasieth so do thei
faste, yea and that for sondry pur|poses.
Sme fast breade and wa+ter,The fonde+nes of the apists in theyr fa|styng.
some eate nothinge but fruit,
some taste no kynde of meate or
dryncke that is dressed with fyre,
some in theyr faste go wolwarde,
barefoted, and barelegged some
are so scrupulous  supersticious
in their fasting, that in the time of
theyr faste they wyll neither eate
nor dryncke, nor sleepe, nor yet
swalowe dowe theyr owne spit|tle,
If they do they thincke them
selues damned. Prouided alway
that they also muste be fyrste and
laste at churche. If they obserue
these fastes, they promyse theym
selues, I knowe not howe great

rewardes, ane how hie seates in
heauen aboud other, and howe
many gay garlandes of red ro|ses
an swete violetes, that God
and oure Ladye and the blessed
saints shal giue them after thys
lyfe for theyr deuout fastyng and
praty paines. O fond folishnes
 folysh fondnes, worthy rather
to be lamented then to be laugh+ed
at. If it be done of a good en|tent,
say they, al is weil whatsoe|uer
we do. If we fast the blessed
Saintes euens,The super+sticious worshyp|pynge of Sayntes. and worshyppe
them wyth a Pater noster, Aue
and Creede, they wyll do for vs
whatsoeuer we axe. S. George
wyl defend vs in battell agaynst
our ennemies. S. Barbara wyll
kepe vs from thondring and li|tenyng.
S. Agasse wyl saue our
house from burning. S. Antony

Sainte Peter wyll lette vs
in at heauen gates, wyth a thou|sande
suche lyke. Thys supersti|cion
and idolatry is the godlines
of the Papistes. If they fast and
serue the saints vnto this end, 
on their feastful daies fare dein|tely
 drynke largelye in the ho|nour
of the good saint, they think

thei haue done much for the saint
and haue shewed theym selues
good, godly and deuout persons.
O double vngodlines.
What shall I speake of the spi+ritual
exercises, whiche the true
and Christen faste requireth to
be done in the time o asting? If
we marke wel the maners of the
papists, and notetheyr behauour
on theyr fastinge daies, we shall
cay perceiue that in the middes
of their fastinge they are no lesse
wicked  vngodlye, no les proud
and enuious, no lesse lecherous,
and couetous, no les backbitinge
and slaunderous no les polling
and pillinge, no les churlish and
vnmerciful, no les geuen to glo|toni
 dronkennes, then thei wer
afore. They lame~t not their syns,
they fall not to faithefull prayer,

they call not on the name of God
as they oughte, but fle vnto crea|tures,
they gyue not them selues
to the hearinge or readynge of
gods worde, which many of them
extremelye abhorre, they go not
about to leaue theyr idolatri and
wish to be better instructed in the
knowledge of gods lawe .c. but
continuing stil in their old super+sticion
 idolatri thei thinke them
selues godly inough and good i|nough.
If thei eat no flesh, if thei
for beare white meates al is wel
whatsoeuer they do, though ther
be no repentaunce, no calling on
the name of god, no correccion of
ma~ners, no ame~dme~t of life, God
haue mercy on vs, god open their
eies  giue the~ grace to amende,
Hitherto haue we learned out
of the word of god, what the true

and Christen faste is. We haue
hearde also, howe greatly the po+pyshe
manner of fastinge diffe|reth
from the true vse of fastinge
whiche the holy scriptures teach.
Nowe the order requireth, that
we also declare, howe we oughte
to faste, that we maye please god
and not faste in vaine as the hy|pocrytes
do.


Howe we oughte to Faste.The .xii. Chapter
IN declarynge howe we ought
to faste, whome shoulde I ra|ther
followe then oure sauiour
Iesus Christe the teacher of all
truthe,Math. vi. whyche saithe: When ye
faste be not sad as the hipocrites
are. For they disfigure theyr fa|ces,
that they myghte be seene
of menne to faste. Uerelye I saye
vnto you, they haue their reward

But thou when thou fastest an|nointe
thy heade, and washe thy
face, that it appeare not vnto
men, that thou fastest, but to thy
father, whyche is in secrete, and
thy father whyche seeth in secrete
shal rewarde the openlye, Christ
oure sauioure in thys place doth
not only rebuke the hipocriticall
and supersticious manner of the
vngodlye fasters, but hee also
teacheth the true manner of fa|stynge.
Of these hys woordes wee
learne, that who so euer enten|deth
to faste a ryghte, hee muste
obserue three thynges.Thre thin+ges are to bee obser|ued in fa|styng. The fyrst
is, that hee annoynte his heade.
The seconde that hee washe hys
face. The thyrde that he faste in
secrete. These Phrases annoin|tynge
of the heade, and washing
of the face with many other seme

verye straunge manners of spea+king
to such as are not perfectly
exercised in the ading of y^ ho|ly
sciptues and of the auncient
wrighters, it is conuenient ther|fore,
that we learn to know what
is meante by them. And no man
in this behalf can satisfy our de|sire
better then our golden mou+thed
Doctoure. S. Iohn Chriso+stome,Hom. xlvi Ex cap. vi Math. ix.
whose wordes are these.
In the annointing o the heade,
saith he, we knowe that mercy is
signified.What it is too an|nointe the heade. Therfore to annoynte
the heade, is to shewe mercye to
our neighbour. For that mercye
that is done vnto a pore man, is
referred vnto God, which is the
heade of the man, as the Apostle
and the lord him self saith.i. Cori. xi. What
soeuer ye haue done to one of my
lessest brothers,Math. xxv ye haue done it

vnto me. In the stede of y^ which
mercye wyth the diuine retribuci+on
as with a certayne he auenlye
oyle, we ar poured and shed ouer
by hymMath. v. which saith. Blessed are
the mercifull for God shall haue
mercye on them.Ps. cxxxiii Holy Dauid al|so
did knowe the vnccion and a|nointinge
of the celestial oyle in
the heade, when he sayde, as in y^
ointmente, whiche came down in
to the bearde.
But in washinge the face, the
puritie of a cleane bodye and of
a sincere conscience is knowen toWhat it is to wash the face.
be signified so that to washe the
face, is to make cleane the face of
our hart from al filthines of sin,
 from the vncomelines of tres|pas,
and to haue a very pure con+science,
that we may truly haue in
vs the gladnes of celestiall ioye.

and the familiaritie and cheare+fulnes
of the holye ghoste.
Hitherto haue I rehearsed the
wordes of .S. Ihon Chrisostome
whereby we maye learne, that to
annoynte oure heade is none o|ther
thynge, then to shewe oure
selues beneficial to the pore mem+bers
of Christe. Againe, to washe
oure face is to make cleane both
bodye and soule from synne and
wyckednes. If we therefore wyll
fast a right after the mind of .S.
Iohn Chrisostome, we must first
annoint our head, y^ is to say, com+fort
the pore people w^t such good
as god hath committed vnto vs.
For the ritches that we haue bee
not ours, but they be gods, as he
saith by y^e Prophet,Agge. ii. gold is mine,
siluer is mine.sa. xxiiii The psalmograph
also saith, the earth is the lords 

al that is contained in it.


The .xiii. Chapter.
GOd hath put y^ goods of this
worlde into the ritche mens
hands,Aspectacle for rytch men. that they shuld distri|bute
part of them to the pore peo+ple.
They ar the stewards of god
and the dispensatours of his trea+sures,
that they conueniently ly|uing
of them, shuld also with the
distribucion of part of them com|forte
the nedy members of Christ
If they spend them otherwise the~
God hath appointed in his word
they shall render a streyghte ac|countes
for it to the highe iudge
Christe. They haue nothynge
at all, but that they shall be cal|led
too accountes for it euen too
the vttermooste farthynge.
If they bee not founde to haueMath. xxv

vsed theyr talente wel, and vnto
the profit of other they shal with
that vnprofitable seruaunte of
the Gospell bee caste into vtter
darckenes, where wepynge and
gnashinge of teethe shall be. If
they be proued vnmercifull and
negligent in the destribucion of
the worldlye goodes, surely they
shalbe caried with the rich gloto~
of whom blessed Luke speaketh
in the gosple vnto hel,Luke. xvi. and there
burne in suche cruell and bytter
flames, as the fire wherof shal ne+uer
be quenched,Esay. lxxi. neither shal the
worme which shal gnaw the con|sciences
of them that are ther, die
at any time, as the prophet saith.
What cause then haue the ritch
menne to boaste themselfes and
to glory of theyr worldly goodes
or to auaunce them selues aboue

other for theyr possessions sake?
Ces none at all, more then a
greate mans seruaunte hathe, to
whome his Lorde and Master
hathe committed hys goodes for
a certayne space to kepe, the ser|uant
loking at euery hour when
his master wil cal him to accou~ts
and require them of him againe.
Basilius Magnus hathe a no+table
sentence,Ser. i. i duites a|uards. and it is this: He
is a very thee and a robber, saith
he, which maketh that thing hys
own that he hath receiued to des|tribute
and giue abrode.An hathe saying for vnmercy|ful rytch|men. For the
bread that thou retainest  kepest
is the bread of the hongri, y^e gar|ment,
which y^ kepest in thy chest,
is the garmente of the naked, the
sho that is mould with the, is the
shoo of him that is vnshod,  the
moni, which y^ hidest in the grou~d

is the mony of the nedye. More|ouerthou
doest iniury and plain
wrong to so many as thou forsa|kest,
when thou art able to helpe
them. Here to pertayneth the sai|yng
of the wyseman.. xxxiiii The bread
of the nedy, is the lyfe of y^ poore,
he that defraudeth him of it, is a
manslear. God also by the Pro|phet
teacheth, that that fast plea|seth
hym best whych is accompa+nied
wyth the workes of mercye
saying:Esal. lvi. i Breake thy bread to the
hungry, and lead the nedye and
wayefaring into thy house. Whe~
thu seest a naked manne couer
hym, and despyse not thy fleshe.
Mark that he sayth:What it is to break thy breade to the hun+grye. Breake thy
bread to the hongrye. Certayne
that expound this text, saye that
thou then breakest thy breade to
the hungry, when thou so fastest,

that thou sparest from thine own
belly to gyue to the pore hongry
man, For a Christen man ought
to be no les careful for the poore,
then for him selfe. We therefore
do breake our bread to the hon|grye,
when wee gyue hym that,
whych we our selues necessaryly
shoulde haue eaten. So that to
annoynte our head, is to breake
our bread to the hongri, to lodge
the poore in oure house, to gyue
clothes to the naked, and to com|forte
accordynge to oure habily|tye
so manye as haue neede of
our helpe. Unto these workes of
mercy doth our Sauiour Christ
exhort vs in the Gospel, saying:
when thou makest a dynner or a
supper,Luk. xiiii. cal not thy fryendes, nor
thy brethren, neyther thy kyns|folke,
nor thy rytch neyghbours,

leaste they also bid the againe, 
a recompence be made the But
when thou makeste a teae, call
the pore, the feble, the lame, and
the blinde, and thou shalt be hap+pye,
for they can not recompence
the. But thou shalt be recompen|sed
at the resurreccion of the igh+teous.
Again he sayeth, geue al|mes
of those things ye haue and
beholde all thinges are cleane
vnto you.Luke. xi. But of this we shal en|treate
more largelye when we
come to the true vse of fastinge.


The .xiiii. Chapter.
MOreouer if we will faste a
righte, we are not only com+maunded
to annointe oure
heade, that is to say, to shew mer+cye
to the pore people, but also to
washe oute face, that is, to make
our heartes cleane from al sinne

thorow faithfull repe~taunce, that
we maye haue a pure conscience.
For it is not inough to be benefi+ciall
to other, excepte we also be
beneficiall to oure selues. Thys
shall come to passe, if we laboure
withall mayne to haue a mynde
pure and cleane from all carnall
affectes, a bodye voide of wicked
dedes, and a lyfe garnished wyth
good workes.Why god did cast a|waye the sacrifices, feasts and fasts of the Iewes. For what was the
cause that God dyd caste awaye
the fastes and solemne feastes of
the Iewes, but only that they wa+shed
not theyr face, that is, they
went not about to put of their old
conuersacion and to become new
men: I hate and abhorre, saythe
God, youre sacrifices, youre so|lempne
feastes and your fastes.Esaye. i.
Offer me no mo oblacions, for it
is but lost labour. Your incense

is abhominacio~ vnto me, I haue
no pleasure in your sacrifices. I
maye not awaye with your newe
mones, your sabbathes. c. Why
soe For your ha~ds, saith he, ar ful
of bloude. Your heartes are full
of vengaunce, youre consciences
are spotted and defyled with all
kinde of sinnes, your life is abho+minable
in my sight, ye walke ha+uinge
no fear of God before your
eies. c. What is then to be done
Be ye washd, saith he, be ye clene
take a wai your euil thoughts fro~
mine eies. Cease to do euil, learn
to do wel. Seke iudgme~t, healpe
y^e pore oppressed, be fauourable
to the comfortles, defend the wi|dow.Iere. iii
c. Again God saith, washe
thine hart fro~ wickednes, y^ thou
maist be healped. How long shal
thy noisome thoughts remain w^t 

the? god hateth those fastes, those
praiers those good deds, as they
cal them, that come fro~ a bloudy
co~science, a spotted  pocki soul, a
defiled bodi  wicked life, as a cer+tayn
man saith,Pius  Roma. It profiteth a ma~
nothi~g at al to fast  pray  to do
other good things of deuocion, ex+cept
the minde be refrained from
vngodlines,  the tung fro~ back
bitings. For god hath euer a prin+cipal
respect to the hart of the do|er
of the work, as we se in y^ histo+rie
of the sacrifices of Abell and
Cain.Gene. iiii. If the hart be pure, cleane
 faithful,God iud|geth the woorke of te heart, and not y^ hearte of the work the~ doth god approue
y^e worke, but if it be spotted wyth
sinne, god casteth it awai appear
it neuer so glistering and comme~+dable
in the sight of the worlde.
Offer not, sayeth the wyse man,
wycked giftes, for God wyll not

receiue them.ec. xxxv. Salomon also sa+eth,
the sacrifices of the vngodly
are abhominable.rou. xxi. That fast ther+fore
that co~meth not from a pure
harte, from an vncorrupt consci|ence
and from a godlye life, plea|seth
not God, but is abhominaci|on
vnto the Lorde oure God, yea
it is by no meanes worthye the
name of a faste. For Basilius
Magnus sayeth,Ser. i. de Ieunio. the true  chri|sten
faste is not only to abstayne
from meates but also to eschewe
euill thynges. And oure golden
mouthed Doctoure saith:Hom. xv. in Cap. vi. ath. he that
abstaineth fro~ meat  not fro~ euil
works, appereth to fast, but yet he
fasteth not in dede. For loke how
much he fasteth vnto me~ so much
doth he eat before god, seing he
goeth forth stil to sin.In Leuit. mel . Cap. vi. The aunci+ent
Doctour Origene saith also

wilt thou that I shewe vnto the,
what fast y^ oughtest to fast? Fast
from euil dedes, abstain from e|uill
woordes, refraine from euill
thoughts. c. Suche a fast plea|seth
God Agayne. S, Hierome
sayeth, then is the abstynence of
the bodye commendable before
God, when the mind fasteth from
vices, For what dothe it profit to
make weake the bodye with ab|stinence,
when the mind swelleth
with pride? Hereunto pertaineth
the sayinge of.Ex sermo|ne. L. lxii S. Austen. The
fastes of christen men, saythe he,
are rather to be obserued spiritu+ally
then carnally. In considera|ion
wherof, let vs fast principal+y
from our sins, least our fast be
refused of the lord, as the faste of
he Iewes were. What a fast is
his, that an impostore or deceit|ful

felow I can not tel who, shuld
abstaine from meates, whych the
Lorde hath created, and yet wax+eth
fatte with the fatnes of sins?
Haue I chosen suche a faste say|eth
the Lorde?Esay. lviii Reade the eighte
and fiftie. Chapter of the Pro|phete
Esaye. And a little after he
sayeth. The faste, which the most
highest do approue and allowe,
is not onlye to leaue of to refresh
the body, but also to depart from
euyll dedes. In a nother place
he also saithe.Ex ract. xvii. in +anes. The great and ge|nerall
faste is to abstaine from i|niquities
and vnlawefull plea|sures
of the worlde whyche is a
perfecte faste, that we forsakinge
vngodlines and the lustes of the
worlde,Titus. ii. shulde liue in this world
soberlye, righteouslye and gody
Of these authorities of the holye

Doctours also do we learn, that
the true Christen faste dothe not
only consiste in the abstinence of
meates, but also in the forsaking
of sinne. Therefore if we entende
to faste a right, and to make our
fast acceptable to God, let vs pro+uide
earnestlye, that oure faste
procede from a pure and cleane
heart, voyd of al carnall affectes,
stuffed ful of faithe and charitie,
and altogether studious of true
innocencye and vnfained godli|nes.
So shal it come to pas, that
both our fastes and all that euer
we do according to gods worde,
shal highly please God. Hitherto
haue we hearde what it is to an|noint
the head and to washe the
face. Nowe remaineth to declare
what it is to fast in secrete.


The .xv. Chapter.
TO faste in secrete,What it is to faste in secrete. is not to
keepe oure selues close from
the sighte of men, and so hy|dinge
our selfes in priuy corners
to abstaine fro~ meate, but not to
hunte and hawke after vaine glo+rye
nor the prayse of men,Math. vi. for our
fastinge, nor to seke to be sene of
men whyle we faste to the ende,
that they may commend  prayse
vs, as the hipocrites did, whome
Christ reproueth for their vaine
glory and ambicion,  saith, they
haue their reward, not of god but
of me~. We ar counted before god
then to fast in secrete, whe~ we fast
with such a minde, y^t we wold fast
in dede, thoughe no man liuinge
did se vs, aud when we regarde
more the acco~plishment of gods
wyll and the subieccion and ta|ming
of our body, then al the glo+rye

and praise that man can giue
vnto vs.It is law+ful to do a+nye good deede in y^ syghte of men, so y^ vayne glo+rye be ab|sente. It is lawful for a Chri|sten
man to fast,Math. v. to praye to geue
almes, or to do anye other good
work before the world, so that the
desire of worldly praise and vain
glorye be not in his minde. For
our sauiour Christ saith let your
light so shine before me~ that they
may se your good works  glori|fy
your father which is in heauen
S. Paul also saith, be such as no
man can complaine on,Philip. ii. and the
vnfained sonnes of God without
rebuke in the myds of a crooked
and peruerse nacion, among who~
se that ye shine as lyghtes in the
world, holding fast the worde of
life.i. Peter. ii. Again. S. Peter counceleth
vs, that where as some backebite
vs as euil doers, we shuld leade
an honest and godlye life among

them, that they seinge oure good
workes maye prayse God in the
daye of visitacion. But if we seke
anye prayse of men,The desire of vayne glory poy+oneth all good wor+kes. and desyre to
be magnified for our good dedes
doinge, verely then haue we our
rewarde not of God but of the
worlde. For there is not a more
pestiferous infeccion to poisonne
anye good woorcke, that it shuld
lose the reward before God, then
the desyre of vaine glory  world+lye
prayse.Math. vi. For that it is, which
Christ condemneth in the almes
dedes, praiers and fastes of the
hipocrits.Hom. xlvi in Mat. vi S. Ihon Chrisostome
saith, they that so fast, y^e thei plese
men rather then God, they haue
a labour concerning the afliccion
of the body, bt thorow vain glo|ry
thei ca~ haue no reward of their
labour with god, which whe~ they
ought to do it onl for religion or

faithes sake, had rather to seke y^
vain glory of the world. And ther+fore
saith the Lord,Lib. iiii. c+tra Iulia cap. ii. verely I saye
vnto you, thei haue receuied thir
reward. S. Auste~ also saith, some
good thinges may be done,  yet
they not doing them wel, of whom
they ar don. For it is a good thi~g
to healp a man y^ is in ieopardy 
in daunger,Mark wel namely if he be an in
innocent. But he that dothe this
good dede if he doth it because he
loueth the praise of menne rather
the~ y^e glori of god, it is not good y^
he doth, for as much as he y^ doth
it, is not good. For God forbid, y^
that shuld be or be cou~ted a good
wil, which glorieth in other, or in
it self,In libro. de elia et eunio.  not in y^e lord. Hereto per|taineth
y^e saying of. S. Ambrose
when thou fastest, boaste not thy
selfe, nor bragge not of it, for in so
doynge thy faste profyteth the

nothing. Those thinges that are
done vnto ostentacion  bosting
continew not to be recompensed
in the world to come, but they are
consumed  brought to noughte
with the rewarde of present thin|ges.
Of exchewinge vaine glory
oure sauiour Christe gaue vs no
table examples in al his doings.
When he had healed the Leper,Mat. viii.
he said vnto him, se y^u tel no man.Math. ix.
After that he hadde restored the
two blinde men to theyr syght, he
charged them, that no man shuld
knowe of it.Mark. ii. And when he hadde
made whole the du~me and deafe
man, he commaunded them that
wer present that they shuld tel it
no man. In al these his doinges
and such like he gaue vs exa~ple
to le vain glory  worldly praise
and onli to seke the glori  honor

of god,eem. ix. and that we shuld reioice
and glorye in nothing but in god
alone, orin. i. as it is wrytten, he that re+ioiseth,
let him reioise in the lord
Therfore all the workes that we
do, whether thei be praier, fasting
almes deede, watching, visiting
of the sicke, comforting of the pri|sonners,
or ani other that be agre+able
to the word of God, we must
do them with a single minde, and
with such an heart, as being alto+gether
estrau~ged from vain glo+ry
and worldly praise, seketh onli
the honour of god  the acco~plish+ment
of his most blessed will. So
shal we do our workes in secrete,
and oure father,Math. vi. which seeth in se+crete
shal recompence vs openli
Thus haue we hearde boothe
what the true  christen fast is, 
also how we ought to fast. Let vs

nowe fall in hand wyth the third
and laste parte of thys treatyse,
and so make an ende,


Of the true vse of fastinge. The .xvi. Chapter.
THe vse yea rather the abuse
of fasting in the Popes king+domeThe man|ner of fa|sting in the Pop ki~g+dome was wycked.
was verie wicked and
worthye to be abhorred of y^ faith+fnll.
For besides the fondnesse of
the symple people in abusing the
noble vetue of fasting for want
of knowledg vnto many and sun+drye
supersticous and vngodlye
purposs as partelye heretofore
we haue heard: ther haue not wa~+ted
among them that profes diui+nitie
whych both in their sermo~s
and writyngs corrupted the true
and godlye vse of fastynge. For
they haue taughte, that fastynge
of it selfe is so worthye a vertue,

and of so greate power, that it is
hable to satysfye for synnes,The erro|neous doc+tryne of y^ Papystes co~cernyu Fastynge. to
appease the wrathe of God, to re+concile
vs to god, to deserue righ+teousnesse
and to wynne euerla|stynge
lyfe. Thys doctryne is an
enemye to the free grace of god,
iniurious to the fruites and me|rites
of Christes passion and by
no meanes to be receiued of the
faithfull Christians.Fastynge is a fruite of repen|taunce. For all be it
fastinge bee wythoute doubte a
worthye fruite of repentaunce,
and pleaseth God, when hee
that fasteth, humbleth hym selfe
in the syghte of God, confesseth
hys synne, repenteth hym of
hys mysdedes, calleth for mer|cye,
beleueth to bee forgeuen for
Christes sake, and studyeth ear|nestly
fro~ he~ce forth to lead a life

comformable to the rule of gods
worde, yet is it not of such vertue
in it selfe, that it is hable to bring
vnto vs those good things which
we looke for at the hande of God
thorowe Christe oure Lorde, I
meane the fauoure of God, the
forgiuenes of sinnes, the gifte of
the holye ghoste, a newe hearte
stuffed with spiritual affects, righ+teousnes,
peace, quietnes of con|science,
and euerlastinge life.
These be the singulare and free
giftes of God, geuen only of him
to so manye as be borne a newe
by the holye ghost, and beleue in
him. If the fastes of the holy men
of whome we hearde here to fore
had bene directed vnto that end,
that is, if by their fastes they had
soughte to be iustified,Gene. xii. xii. xxvi. and .xxviii and tour|ned
theyr eyes from that blessed

sede, in whome all nacions of the
earthe were promised to be bles|sed,
so had theyr fastes bene no
commended but discommended
of God, not fauoured but abhor|red,
not receiued but reiected.
But theyr fastes came from a pe+nitent
and faithful heart toward
God, and were exercised of them
vnto godly purposes, as we haue
hearde, they seekinge saluacion
onlye at the mercyfull hande of
God for the promysed seede sake
therefore were boothe they and
theyr fastes allowed of God.The fasts of the olde Fathers. Let
vs therefore learne the true vse
of fastinge, that we maie knowe
to what ende oure fastes oughte
to be directed, least while we seke
for medicine, we find poison, and
receiue for saluacion, damnacio~.

that ther is not a more spe+dye

that is the flesh, beinge once sub|dued,
the forayne ennemyes shal
the easelier be kept oute, and we
liue in the more quietnesse by the
healpe of goddes spirit and fer|uente
prayer.


The .xviii. Chapter.
ANd heare begin we to learn
the true vse of fastinge, and
to know vnto what end our
fastes ought to be directed. The
fyrste true and godlye vse of fa|stynge
is to subdue the fleshe, to
mortifye her beastelye affectes,
and to represse the wilde  ranck
mocions thereof, that it maye be
subiecte and obediente to the spi+rite
as an handmaide to her ma|stres,
or a seruaunte to his Lord.

For al be it God hathe made vs
of two partes, that is, of bodye
and spirite, yet hath he ordayned
the spirite to bee ruler, and the
fleshe to bee in subieccion to the
spirite.The rebel+lion of the fleshe a|gainst the spirite. But not wyth standynge
the fleshe (suche is her wylde dis|obedience
and disobedient wylde+nesse)
canne by no meanes abide
to submyt her selfe to the rule of
the spirite, but continuallye stry|ueth
to haue the vpper hand, and
contrarye to gods appoinmente
to make the spirit subiect vnto her
The spirite prouoketh vnto hu|militie,
Charitie, Pacience, quy|etnesse,
continencye, purenesse of
lyfe, moderate eatynge and drin|kinge.
c. The flesh contrariwise
calleth vnto pride, hautynesse of
mynde, enuye, malice vengaunce
discord, whordo~, auoutry, glotoni

dronkenship. c. So that ther is
a continual conicte betwene the
spirite  the fleshe who shal haue
the victorye as. S. Paule saieth
If the flesh subdueth the spirite,
then pearyshe wee,Galath. v but if the spi|rite
accordynge to goddes ordy|naunce
beareth rule, and hathe
the fleshe in subieccion, then well
are we. Nowe that thys maye be
broughte to passe, godly  Chri|sten
abstinence shall healp great+lye.Fastynge tameth the flesh.
For there is nothinge that so
tameth and bringeth vnder the
wylde and vnrulye lustes of the
flesh, as fasting and abstine~ce, e|uen
as there is nothing that ma|keth
a wilde and fearce horsse so
tame and obedyent to his master
as the withdrawing of his haye,
otes, breade, and suche other pro|uender.
They therefore that wyl

vse theyr faste a ryghte and vn|to
a godlye ende, muste fyrste di|recte
it vnto this purpose, that by
the exercyse thereof they may bry+dle
the wantonnes of the fleshe,
and refraine theyr bodyes fro~ sin
that the spirite,i. Pete. iii. whiche is a preci|ous
thinge before God, maye be
quiet, or els all other exercises 
trauails although neuer so pain+full,
are vayne. To thys vse ser|ued
the fastes of manye godlye
bothe men and women in tymes
paste, that the bodie beinge mor|tified,
the spirite might the more
frely attend on God. The prince
like Prophet saieth, I putte on
sacke cloth and humbled my soul
with fasting.Psa. xxxv This holy Prophet
and kinge vsed fastinge to thys
ende, that hee mighte bringe his
bodye lowe and in subieccion to

the spirit, that the vngodli lustes
thereof myghte no more rage 
rule in hym as they dyd, eg. xi what
time he tooke Bothsaba the wyfe
of Urias  laye wyth her,  that
he myghte freelye enioie her, cau+sed
her husbande to bee slayne
in battell.Psal. cix. In another place hee
also sayeth, my knees are weake
thorowe fastinge, my fleshe dryed
vp for want of fatnes. We reade
lykewyse,Esthe. xiiii that that mooste vertu|ous
Quene Esther broughte her
bodye verye lowe wyth fastinge
Agayne.. Cori. ix. S. Paul sayeth of him
selfe, I chastise and tame my bo|dye,
and bring it into subieccion,
least bi any means it come to pas
that when I haue preached to o|ther,
I my self shuld be cast awai
These with manye other chasty|sed
and tamed theyr bodyes with

fastinge, that the spirite myghte
haue free course vnto God and
bee occupyed aboute heauenlye
thynges. After thys manner
oughte all true Christians to do,
that the bodye being kept in sub|ieccion,
the spirite maye rule and
haue the ouerhande, and by no
meanes to follow the wycked ma+ner
of the papists, whych in theyr
fastes abstain fro~ grosse fleshe, 
deuoure all kynde of deinty and
fine fishe, whiche make theyr bo|dies
muche more prone to lewd|nes,
then the eatyng of flesh, and
also bringeth the spirit into mise+rable
seruitute  bondage. O vn+godlye
manner of fastinge.


The .xix. Chapter.
VNto this taming,De salut. document Capi. xxxv chastining
subduing  mortifying of y^
flesh by y^ true vse of fasting

dothe. S. Austen exhort vs, say|inge:
Let oureflesh be continu|allye
subiecte to oure soule, and
serue it as an handmaide dothe
her Masters. Lette vs not suffer
oure bodye to be ouerlustye, least
 warre against the spirite, but
alwayes let the fleshe be subiecte
that it obei the commaundement
of the holye ghost.Bene. xvi. Neither let vs
suffer the handmaide to waxe to
rancke, leaste she set lyght by her
maistres, but rather let her obey
all her commaundementes and
do her seruise. For as horses must
be brideled, so muste our bodies
be restrained with fasting, watch
 prayer For as if the guides of
chariots do giue their horsse the
reanes thei draw them into head
long down fals so if our body be
not brideled, the soul and it both

together slip into the depe pit of
hel. Let vs therfore be good and
experte Carters or Chariot dry|uers
to our body, that we may go
the rigtwai. c.Quest. . xx vet. et d|test. Again he saieth
fasting swageth the intemperan+cye
and vnrulines of the bodye,
and represseth or keepeth vnder
the troubios mocions  raging
lustes therof. It causeth the soul
to e at liberty and not to be op|pressed
of the flesh, as the Lorde
saith, take hede that your hartes
be not ouercom with surfetyng 
dro~ke~nes.Luke. xxi. For whe~ the soul is de|liuered
fro~ to much eating  drin+king,
then doth it consider it selfe
the bttr,  waieth in what case it
standeth. For as a ma~ in a filthye
glas seeth not him selfe such one
as he is in deede, so likewise if he
be ouerladen wyth to muche ea|tynge

and drinckynge, he thinc|keth
him selfe to be another man+ner
of man then he is. Yea then
is hee prouoked vnto sensuali|litie
and filthye luste, moued vn|to
anger, puffed vp with pride, 
stirred vnto letchery. In respecte
wherof the Apostle sayeth, be not
dronke wyth wyne,. v wherin is vn+honest
behauioure. But if the bo+dy
be kept in order, and accusto|med
wyth fastyng, then doth the
soul know the better, with what
deuocio~ she ought to serue her re|demer.
Fastyng therfore is very
necessari. Hereunto pertaineth y^
saying of.In Gene. Home. ix. Why we abstayne from mea|tes. S. Ihon golde~ mouth
The abstinence fro meates is re|ceiued
for this purpose, y^ it shuld
restrain the rigour  fearsnes of
y^ flesh to make it obedient to the
spirit, eue~ as an horse is to his ke+per.

For he that fasteth, muste a|boue
all thinges refraine anger,
learne mekenes and gentlenes,
haue an hearte contrite, and such
one as may repel and put backe
vncleane concupiscences  lusts
He muste also set before his eies
alway the eye of the euerlastinge
iudge and y^ iudgeing place that
canne not be corrupted. Againe
he muste by his monye be made
the better by distributing it to the
pore,  haue rule ouer it. He must
be liberal in geuing almes  re|ceiue
into his hart no euil against
his neighboure,Esay.  as Esaye spea|king
in y^ perso~ of god sath: haue
I chosen this fast, sayth the lord?
Thoughe thou wrye aboute thy
necke lyke an hoope, and strow|est
vnder the sackeclothe and
ashes, yet wyll not I regard thy
fast saith the lord. What fast the~,

tel me? Losen, saith he, the bonds
of the wicked bargaines, breake
thy breade to the hongry bringe
the pore man that hath no house
into thi house. If thou doest these
these things, saith he, the~ shal thy
light breake forth as y^ morning
light and thy health shal spryng
right shortly. Hast thou now sene
(my welbeloued) what y^ true fast
is? Let vs loke vpo~ this fast, and
let vs not thincke, as many do, y^
fastinge standeth in this pointe,
if we continewe without any din+ner
til it be night. S. Hierome al+so
saieth: Satietie or fulnes is to
be exchewed euen of y^ most vyle
meats. For ther is nothing y^ so o|uerwhelmeth
y^ mind, as a ful bel|lye.
Thus haue we herd that the
first  principal vse of fastinge is
to tame, chastise, subdue  mortifi

the flesh,A Rule to bee obser|ued in fa|styng. y^ it resist not, but rather
obei the rule of y^ spirit as an ha~d
maide, her maistres, or an horsse
hys keper. But this is to be co~si|dered
in our fasting, y^ we do not
with our vnmeasurable fasts so
make weake  feable the bodye,
that it be hable to serue neyther
God, nor our neighbour, nor yet
our selues,  by this meanes vt|terly
quench the vse  workyng
of the spirit, as we rede that ma|ny
in times past haue done, such
fasts please not God. This com+mau~dement
therfore of S Paul
is to be obserued in al our fasts,
Make not prouisio~,Rom. xiii. sayth he, for
the flesh to fulfyl the lustes of it.
An horsse that is to much delicate
lyfed, casteth his master, againe
if he be kept to hongry, he fayn|teth
in the mids of the iourney, 
doth not his office. A meane ther+fore

is to be had as in fedinge of
the horsse, so likewise in ordering
of the bodye. We lyue not to eat,
but we eate to lyue.


The .xx. Chapter.
THe seconde cause whye wee
ought to vse fastinge is,To fast to gyue vnto the poore. that
we abstaining from meates,
maye haue to giue vnto the pore
and hongry the more liberallye.
For this kind of fasting pleaseth
God greatly, when he seeth that
we haue so put on the bowels of
tender mercy  are led with such
and so harty compassion toward
our pore neighbour, that we can
not finde in our hearte he shulde
want, yea rather then he shoulde
lacke, we wil spare it out of oure
own belli  giue it him, god right
wel accepteth this fast, and bles|seth
the faster wyth plentye and
abundaunce, as the wisema~ saith

He that hath pitie on the poore,Proue. xix
maketh the Lord his debter, and
loke what he layeth oute, it shal
bee payed hym agayne. Unto
thys manner of fastynge dothe
God exhorte vs by the Prophet,Esay. lvi
where he saieth, breake thi bread
to the hongrye, and lede the nea|dye
and wayefaringe men into
thyne house. Whe~ thou seest a na+ked
man, couer him, and despyse
not thi flesh. What it is to breake
thy bread to the hongri, we heard
afore in the .xiii. chapter.Toby. x. The an+gell
of God tolde Thobye that
when fastinge praier and almes
deedes go together, that is good
and accepted in the Lordes sight
It is written in a certaine oke
called Pastor (the author wherofHermas S. Paules Dyscipe.
they say Hermas. S. Pauls dis|ciple
was) on thys manner: On
that daye that thou shalte faste,

thou shalt taste nothing at al but
bread and water,  whe~ thou hast
cou~ted the quantitye of the meat
that thon wast wont to eat on the
other daies, the cost y^ thou shul|dest
make on that daye that thou
fastest lay it vp,Mark  folow.  giue it to the wi+dow,
to the fatherles childe~, or to
the porema~, and so shalt thou fast
a good fast, that he which hath re+ceiued
it of the, may fil his soule,
and that his praier may go vnto
the lord for the. If thou fulfillest
thy fast on this ma~ner, as I com|maund
the, thy sacrifice shalbe ac+ceptable
to the Lorde, and thy
fast shalbe written in the boke of
life.In Leui. Cap. vi. Home. x. Origen saithe, we finde in a
certaine boke, that the Apostles
saide, blessed is he that fasteth to
thys ende, that he maye nourishe
the poore man.A notable sentence. The fast of suche
one is wonderfully accepted be|fore

God. Hereto pertaineth the
sayinge of.Quest. C. xx. S. Austen, mercy dyd
commende and greatly setforthe
the praier and fastinge of Corne|lius.Actes. x.
For hee beinge ryche and a
wealthye man fasted. He dyd not
onlye faste, but he also fed them
that wanted, that theyr fulnesse
myghte make his faste accepta|ble.
Agayne in a nother place he
sayeth,Serm lvi de tempo. before all thynges, that
whyche we were wonte to eate at
our dynner, on the fastyng daies
let vs bestowe it on the poore.
Oure goulden mouthed Doc|toure
in a certayne homilie coun+celleth
vs,In Gene. Home. vii. that when so euer wee
faste, we should be lyberall to the
poore, and gyue theym largelye
of oure goods. In a nother place
he also sayeth, he that eateth hys
meate and is not hable to fast,Home. ix. In Gene. let
hym geue the larger almes, lette

him be the more diligent in prai|ing,
let him haue the more ferue~t
desyre to heare the word of God.
Here Chrisostome estemeth al|messe
among other vertues of so
hie price, that if ther be ani which
can not abyde to fast for y^ weak+nes
of theyr bodye, yet if they be
plenteous in doinge the workes
of mercye and in prayinge and
hearing the worde of God, they
are not refused of god, but accep+ted
as good Christians. Mercye
therfore and almes is a precious
thinge in the sighte of God and
ought to be exercised of the faith+ful,
when so euer occasion is ge|uen
whether they faste or not.
Mercye,Toby. xii saieth the aungell, is
beter then to hoorde vpe trea|sures
of golde. For mercye dely|uereth
fro~ death clense the sin, 
causeth to find euerlasting life.
Thus haue wee hearde that
Christen menne oughte to vse
theyr faste vnto thys ende, that
they abstaynynge frome meate
and drincke mighte haue wher|of
to geue the more abundant|lye
to the poore, to feede the hun|grye,
to clothe the naked, to re|lieue
the sicke, to healpe the en|debted,
and to comforte the nea|dye.
O blessed are they that so
faste.Rara auis in terris. But wher are they, and we
shall commende them, and call
them blessed? For great and com+mendable
thynges dooe suche
woorcke amonge theyr neygh|boures
and Christen brethren.


The .xxi. Chapter.
THirdly if we wyll vse fasting
aryghte,Fasting to serue pray+er. we must vse it vnto
this ende also, that by the di|lygent
doing and often exercyse

therof we may be made the more
apte to praye and to lifte vp oure
heartes vnto the Lord our God
with feruent praiers, humble sup+plications,
and heartye thanckes
geuinge. For vnto this ende ser|ued
fasting in times past, as dy|uers
histories of the holye scryp|ture
do declare. If anye mysfor|tune
or greuous plage chaunced
at any time to the people of god,Iudi. xx.
then streightwaies they fasted, as
we reade in the boke of iudges.
Againe, if anye plage wer threat+ned
the~ by the Prophetes of god
for theyr wyckednes,Ionas. iii as we reade
of the Niniuites, or if they percei+ued
anye great euyl to be at hand
as wee reade in the histories of
the Israelites,i Reg. vii. of Iehosaphat,
Iudith,ii. Para. xx Esther. c. then fell they
straightwaies to fastinge.Iudit. iiii. and .viii.
And theyr fastes wer taken vn|toEsther. iiii

this end, that they might hum+ble
theym selues in the syghte of
God, and be made the more mete
for to pray,  to swage the wrathe
of God. Nether do we read, that
anye solempne fast was proclay|med
at any time,Why the godly men vsed fast|ynge in times past but it was done
to this end, that the fasters might
the more quietlye and frely serue
god, and cal on his holy name, by
feruent and co~tinual praier. And
as we read this in the olde testa|mente,
so lacke we not the like ex+amples
in the newe. Is it to bee
doubted, but that oure sauyoure
Christe in that time of his longe
and solempne faste ioyned to his
faste prayer?Math. iiii. He withoute doubt
prayed vnto God hys father all
that tyme, that by his preachinge
whyche was at hande, manye
myghte bee tourened from theyr
vngodlynesse vnto the true wor|shippinge

of God, from wicked|nes
of life vnto innocencye of ma~+ners,
We reade also that the god+lyeLuke. ii.
Matrone Anne serued God
in the temple wyth fastynge and
prayer both day and night. The
Apostles likewise after Christes
ascencio~ did alwaies ioin to their
fastinge,Actes .xiii. and .xiiii. praier. In like manner
reade we of the vertuous manne
Cornelius, whiche ioined to hys
fastinge bothe prayer and almes
deede,Actes. x. And the aungel sayde vn|to
Thobye, prayer is good wyth
fastinge.Toby. xii. Esdras sayd lykewyse
to the Iewes. We fasted  pray|ed
vnto the lord,i. Esdr. viii  we had good
lucke. Quene Esther also sente
woorde to Mardocheus,Esthe. iiii. saying,
gather together all the Iewes,
and praye for me, but se that ye
neither eat nor dryncke .iii. daies
and three nyghtes, and I wyth

my maides wyl fast  pray lyke|wyse.
Again Eliachim the priest
saied to y^e children of Israel, whe~
they were in greate sorowe and
danger of theyr enemyes.Iudit. iiii. Be ye
sure, that the Lord wil hear your
petycyons if ye contynewe sted|faste
in fastynges and prayers
in the syghte of the Lorde. Thus
se we, that the godly people both
of the olde and of the new testa|mente,
ioined alwaies for y^e most
part fasting and praier together,
thincking them selues the~ to fast
wel, whe~ their faste was acco~pai|ned
wyth prayer, as it is wrytten,
prayer is good with fastinge. S.Toby. xii.
Peter also saith, be ye sober and
watche vnto prayer.i. Pet. iiii.


The .xxii. Chapter.
MOreouer our sauiour christ
also ioineth praier  fastingMat. xvii.
together wherhe saith, this

kynde of dyuels is not caste out
but by fastyng  praier.Mark. ix. To thys
kind of fasting doth S. Paul ex|hort
vs whe~ he saith:ii. Cori. vi. let vs giue
no occasion of euil, that in our of|fyce
be found no faute, but in all
things let vs behaue our selues
as the ministers of God in much
pacience, in laboures, in watch|ings
 fastings: Also S. Peter
Be ye sober, sayth he,i. Pet. iiii. and watch
vnto prayer. And from the con|trari
doth our sauiour Christ cal
vs away, saying: Take heede to
your selues,Luke. xxi. lest at any time your
herts be ouercom with surfeting
and dronkennes,  cares of thys
lyfe, and so the dai (of iudgeme~t)
come on you vnwares. The pro|phet
Esay thoundereth agaynst
them, which despising this godly
maner of abstinence, set al theyr
minds on bankettyng and belly

there. Wo be vnto the~ sayth he:
that rise vp early to folow dron|kennes,Esaye. v.
and to them that conty|nue
so vntyl nyght, and tyll they
be set on fyre wich wine. In those
companies are harps and lutes,
Tabrets and pipes  wyne. But
they regard not y^ work of y^e lord.
Agayne he saythe: Wo be vnto
the~ y^t are strong to sup out wyne,
 expert me~ to set vp dronke~nes.
These giue sentence with the vn+godly
for rewards, but co~demne
the iust cause of the ryghteouse.
Therfore like as fyre licketh vp
the straw, and as the flame con|sumeth
the stuble, euen so theyr
roote shalbe as corrupcion, and
theyr blossom shal vanysh away
like dust, for they haue cast awai
the law of the Lord of hosts, and
blasphemed the word of the ho|ly,
maker of Israel. From beast|ly

ba~ketting vnto faithful fasti~g
 contynual calling on the name
of the Lord doth the prophet Io|el
cal these belly goddes, saying,
Wake vpye dro~ckards  weepe
mourne al ye wine bibbers,Ioel. i.  not
without a cause. For he y^t hath his
bodye loden wyth meat  drinke
is no more mete to prai vnto god
then a dead ma~ is to tel a tale, ne+ther
can the minde of such one a|ny
more fly vnto god with heaue~+ly
desires, then a ship to much cu~+bred
with burdens  at the point
to sinck, can any lenger flote vpo~
of y^e waters, We haue a prouerb
no les true then commen among
vs.A true and co~mo~ pro|uerbe. When the belly is ful, the bo|dy
wold be at reast, meaning that
he, which hath enfared his belly
with delicious meates and costi|ous
dri~cks, is more mete to stepe
like a swine, the~ to take any ear|nest,

 weighti matter in ha~d. We
haue not red saith .S. Eiprian,Ser. dete~t et ieiunio. Christi. y^e
the godly men did euer take any
great thing in hand, except they
first fasted. So oft as they we~t a|bout
to obtain any thing of God,
they fasted,  wept, and watched
whole nightes in praier,  weare
garmentes of heare next to their
flesh,  so withal humblenes, desi+red
god to be benificial to the~. Ne+ther
wanted they of their purpose
whe~ they most hu~bly fel down at
the fete of god  offered vnto him
the sacrifice of a contrite hart, but
god was neare vnto them, y^t cal|led
on him,  reached forthe hys
hand to them y^t wer in daunger, 
holpe the~ that wer in trouble. A|gain

on the whych the people shoulde
resorte and come together vnto
the temple for to praye vnto the
Lord God. And that they myght
come the more deuoutely  pray
wyth the greater fruite, they ap|pointed
also that the daye before
the solemne feast, they shuld fast
that they myght be the more apt
to pray, whe~ they come together
into the temple.Note. For wher the bo+dy
is burdened wyth meate, ther
the mynde can haue no free pas|sage
vnto God. Let the~ therfore
that fast, appointe their fastynge
also to thys vse, that by theyr ab|stinence
they may be the more re

pray,  not only to prepare them
selues to pray, but also earnestly
to gyue theyr mindes vnto prai|er,
or els what doth theyr fast pro+fit
them? To faste from meat and
to goo about worldlye matters,
what other thing is it, then a moc+kinge
of God,  a derision of chri+sten
abstinence as .S.Ambrose. Ambrose
saith, doest y^u thincke y^t he fasteth
aright, whiche waking betymes
in the morning goeth not vnto y^
church (to prai  to hear the word
of god) but as sone as he is vp, ga+thereth
together hys seruauntes
laieth abrode his nets, bryngeth
forth his dogs,  goeth running
about the forestes? Therefore if
we faste, lette vs faste a ryghte,
and after the examples of the au~+cyente
holye fathers lette vs al|waye
couple prayer wyth our fa|stinge.
So shall boothe we, oure

fastes  our praiers please God.


The .xxiii. Chapter.
FOurthelye and finally foras|muche
as the word of God is
the singuler and vnspeakea|ble
gift of God,Psalm. ix geuen of him to
be a lantarne to oure feete and a
light to our pathwaies,Psal. xix. to tourne
souls from idolatri vnto true god
lines, to giue wisdom to the hum|ble,
to make the faithful penitent
heartes glad, to lighten the eies
of the ignoraunt, to teach the true
relygyon, to iproue errourres
and heresies,ii. Tim. iii. to amend sinners, 
to instruct all degrees in righte|ousnes,
that the man of God may
be perfect and prepared vnto all
good worckes: it is conueniente,
whither wee heare t of other or
reade it oure selues, that we both
heare and reade it wyth greate

reuerence and all humilitie, se|inge
that not man, but the holye
ghoste is the authoure of it, whi|che
breathed into the heartes of
holye mnnethe knowledge of it,
and putte in theyr myndes what
they oughte to wryghte as .S.
Paule sayeth, the whole scryp|ture
was geuen of God by inspi|racion.ii. Tim. iii.
And .S. Peter recordeth
the same,i. Peter. i. sayinge. The scrypture
came neuer by the wyl of manne,
but holye men of God spake, as
they wer moued by y^ holy ghost.
If the holye scripture then com|meth
fro~ god,  god be the author
of it, who dare presume either to
heare or to reade it, but wyth an
humble reuerence and reuerent
humilitie?Ad Iulia|num, ep. . As .S. Austen sayeth,
by the bookes of the holye scryp|ture
God hym self and oure lord
speaketh vnto vs, and sheweth

vnto the effecte of a godlye wyll
Let vs then consider and marke
well, with what honoure the mes|sage
of that god and Lord ought
to be receiued of vs. What if a
message came vnto vs very ear|lye
in the mornyng from a kyng,
wold we not streight waies (al o|ther
cares laied aside) receiue the
letters with a readye wil  with|al
deuocio~, and after we had red
theym, laboure to fulfill the kyn|ges
request to y^ vttermoste? And
beholde from the heauen of hea|uens
the Kynge of kynges and
Lorde of Lordes, yea and our re|demer
hathe vouched safe to dy|recte
hys letters vnto vs by the
Prophetes and Apostles, not
that hee shoulde commytte vnto
vs anye seruyce necessarye for
hym, but sygnifye, what thynges
maye dooe vs good vnto salua|cion

and glorye. O wyth what,
reuerence and greate honoure
oughte we then to receiue, reade
or heare the letters of thys euer|lastinge
king and immortal god
sente for oure glorye and for our
saluation, seing that by them not
man, bt God speaketh vnto vs
as oure sauioure Christe testifi|eth,
he that heareth you (he spea|keth
of the preachers of goddes
word) heareth me,Luke. x.  he that despy+seth
you, despiseth me,  he that de+spiseth
me, despiseth hym that sent
me. Now y^ we may come reuere~t+ly
 humblye to the hearinge of
gods worde, it shal not be vnsit|ting
to vse our fast vnto this end
also, that we maye come vnto it
with fasting  empty stomackes,
that oure mynde and inwarde
ma~ mai haue the purersenses to
vnderstande, the cleare sighte to

beholde, the more open eares to
heare, and the gredier stomacks
to digest the holi misteries of god
For likewise as he is no mete ma~
to pray vnto God, that commeth
out of the Tauern sweating and
set on fire with drincking of whot
wine  eati~g of delicious meats,
so in like maner is he no fit man
either to reade or to hear y^ word
of god, that hath a ful gorge and
stuffed belly. The more the body
is filled, the more is the mind dul+led,
 made vnapt to receiue any
message from god.ii. Cor. iiii. But albe it y^
outward man decay  be made fe+ble
for a tyme, yet the inwarde
man is renewed day by day, and
made strong. And this meant the
holy fathers  godlye bishops of
Christes churche in tymes paste,
when they appointed fastinge on
the eue~s of solempne feastes, that

the people by their fasting might
be made the more apt the day fo+lowing,
when they came to the te~+ple,
to heare the blessed worde of
theyr saluacion.
The holy letters do testify,Exo. xxiii that
when Moses receiued the law, he
was in the mount with God, and
fasted .xl. daies and .xl. nights be|fore
the tales of the law wer de|liuered
vnto him,Belly bestes ar not mete to re|ceyue the woorde of God. where of wee
maye learne howe reuerently we
oughte to take the word of god,
au not to come vnto it with vn|washed
fete, as they vse to say,
And this is to be noted by y^ way,
that as Moses fasting was fou~d
worthy to receiue the law of god,
so likewise when he came downe
from the mount  saw the people
droncke and mad,Exo. xxxii singinge  pi|ping,
dau~ci~g  leaing, he threw
down the tables of y^e law,  brake

them on peces, by this declaring
that Epicures and belly gods be
no worthy and mete vessels to re+ceiue
the new wine of gods word
When the children of Israellii. Esd. ix.
at a certaine time came together
to read the boke of the law of the
Lord, they fasted the whole day,
that they mighte reade the holye
scriptures with the more reuere~ce
and bee made the more mete to
haue the holy ghost present with
them to teache them by hys god|lye
inspiracion.
Esdras also being greatly desi+rousiiii. Esd. v.
to haue certaine secretes o|pened
vnto him, was commaun|ded
of Uriel the angel to fast. vii
daies first of al. Whych thing he
did, and had hys desyre satisfied.
In like manner after the Pro+phet
Daniel had fasted and prai+edDan. ix. x
vnto the Lord for knowledge

of certain misteries, Gabriel the
aungell of God came and reue|led
vnto him the secretes of Chri+stes
incarnatio~, passion, death. c
When Baruche red hys bokeBaruch. i.
before the kinge and the kinges
councell and before all the peo|ple,
they all wepte fasted  pray|ed
before the Lorde.Math. iiii.
Before that oure sauyoure
Christe tooke vppon hym the of|fice
of preachinge to declare vn|to
the people the ioyfull tidinges
that he broughte frome heauen,
he fasted .xl. daies and .xl. nights
and dyd eate nothinge at all, ge|uinge
vs example by his fasting
not to faste the like fast, which is
impossible and aboue y^e natural
strengthes of ani ma~, but to come
vnto the word of god thorow fa|sting
with al reuerence  humili+tie,
whither we reade or heare it.
The Apostles of Christ lyke|wiseActes i. ii.
before they vniuersally prea+ched
the kyngdom of Christ, fa|sted
and praied, and as they wer
fastyng and prayinge, the hollye
Ghoste came downe vpon them
and endued them with the know+ledge
of al languages,  taught
them the true vnderstandynge
of Gods holy misteries.
To ende,. x. Cornelius being ve+ry
desierous to knowe y^ true and
approued religio~ before God, fa+sted

god gracious satisfied his desire


The .xxiiii. Chapter.
TThus le we that all godlye
men both of the old and new
Testament vsed abstinence
for the most part,We muste com to the woorde of ed reue+rentlye. whe~ they shuld
eyther preach, heare or read the
worde of God, that they myghte
come the more reuerentlye vnto

it, and be made the more mete to
handle so holye and worthye mi|steries.
It is conuenie~t therfore y^
we also, if we wyll vse fastinge a|right,
do folowe the examples of
these holi men, whensoeuer we en+tende
eyther to preache, reade or
heare the worde or God, and not
vnreuerentlye to come vnto the
holy scripture, as vnto prophane
wrightings,Abuers of the word of God. after the example of
many vngodly parsons which w^t
out al humilitie  reuere~ce read
the woorde of god as thoughe it
wer an Ethnike chronicle, a boke
of mannes statutes, of Beuise of
Hampton, of Gye of Warwicke,
of Robinhoode, and suche other
lyke fonde and foolyshe fansyes
yea ther wa~t not (the greater shal
be our plage) which scorn y^ word
of god and moste shamefullye a|buse
it, some vnto koffynge and

iesting, some vnto the tauntinge
of other, some vnto y^ vpholdi~g of
their fleshly liberty  corrupt ma~+ners,
some vnto the maint eining
of wicked opinions. c. whose de|struccion
slepeth not, whose dam|nacion
is at hand.Math. vii. For if it be not
lawful to cast pearles before hogs
nor to gyue that is holy to dogs,
nether is it lawful for hogges to
touch pearles, nor dogs to taste y^
is holi. If thei wer punished that
did eate vnleuended bread at the
feast of the passeouer,Exodi. xii. if Uza wer
striken vnto y^ death for touching
the arcke,ii. Reg. vi. if that geast y^t came vn+to
the maryage not hauinge the
wedding garmente,Math. xxiii was bounde
hand and feete, and ast into vt|ter
darcknes, wher weping and
gnashinge of teethe is, if the Co|rinthes
wer plaged for abusinge
the lords supper,i. Corin. xi let not those swi+nish

Epicures, doggish papistes
Licencious Libertines, vngodly
Anabaptistes, grosse gospellers
and wicked worldlinges thincke
that they shal escape vnpunished
if they go forth to abuse the word
of god or to come vnreuerentlye
vnto it. For the holye scripture is
the message of god, brought vnto
vs from heauen by his holy Em|bassadoures
the Prophetes  A|postles
yea by his own dearly be
loued sonne that kinge of glory,
which sealed  confirmed it with
the sheding of his most precious
blud: it may not therfore be light+ly
regarded, nor vnreuere~tli ha~d+led.
For if the y^t despyseth Moses
law,ebru. x. saith .S. Paul, dieth w^toute
mercy vnder .ii. or .iii. wytnesses,
how much sorer, suppose ye, shal
he be punished, which tredeth vn+der
fote the son of god  counteth

the blud of the Testament, whe
with he was sanctifed, as an vn|holy
thyng, and doth dishonoure
to the spirit of Grace.
That we therfore maye hum|bly,
reuere~tly deuotely  hono|rably
come vnto the preachyng,
hearing or reading of the blessed
word of God, let vs not neglecte
thys noble vertue of fasting, but
after the exa~ple of the aforesayd
godly men prpare our selues by
the diligent exercise therof, to be
mete to handle so holye and hea|uenly
misteries. By this meanes
shal it come to passe, y^ god which
is the author of the holi scripture
shal alwaye be present wyth vs
by hys holy spirit, and teache vs
the true knowledge of hys god|ly
wyl, vnto the glory of his bles|sed
name, the profit of hys holye
congregacion, and the syngular

comfort of our conscience.
Howe haue wee hearde fyrste
what the true and Christen faste
is.The con|clusion of the booke. Secondly, how we oughte to
fast. Thyrdlye, what the true vse
of fasting is.Luke. xii. It remayeh that
we be not lyke that neglige~t ser|uaunt
whych knoweth hys ma|sters
wyl, and doth it not,  ther|fore
is beate~ wyth many stripes,
but rather that we be likened vn+to
that good seede whyche bryn|geth
forth her encrease, some an
hu~dred fold,Math. iii some threscore fold,
som thirty fold. If we now know
the true doctrine of the holy scrip+ture
concerning fasting, lette vs
practise it in oure conuersacion,
when so euer any suche occasyon
is offered, as heretofoe is decla|red,Titus. ii.
and at all tymes let vs lyue
soberlye, ryghteouslye and god|lye
in thys presente worlde.
Lette vs not with the abuse caste
waye the vse, but let vs so muche
the more gladly exercise the god+ly
manner of fasting, because the
vngodlye papistes rayle on vs,
 co~tinnally beat into the symple
peoples heades, y^ we which pro|fesse
the gospel, abhorre and con+dempne
all fastynge and praye|inge,
all co~mendable customes 
godlye ordinaunces, that by well
doing we may stop the mouthes
of folish and ignorau~t men, and
that they, which backebite vs as
euil doers,i. Peter. ii. maye se our good wor+kes
and praise. God in the day of
visitacion, to whome be all ho|nour
and glory for euer and euer
Giue the glory to God alone.
