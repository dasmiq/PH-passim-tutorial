A TREATISE of the Heauenly MANSIONS.

IOHN 14. 1.
And Iesus said to his Disciples: Let not your hearts be trou|bled: Yee beleeue in God, be|leeue also in mee.

_AT this ChapterThese words containe: 1 A Com|fort: 2 A Con|firmation of it. begins the Le|gacie, or latter Will, of our ord Christ Iesus, and ontinues to the eigh|teene.

In the entry there|of, hee first comforts his Disciples against the fear of all euill which may trouble them: and next by strong arguments con|firmes the Comfort. InIn the Comfort are three circum|stances. the Comfort three Cir|cumstances are to be con|sidered: First, who giues it? Christ Iesus: Second|ly, to whom? to his Dis|ciples. Thirdly, the Com|fort it selfe; Let not you heart be troubled, pro|poned, as you see, by1 First cir|cumstance, hee who giues the Comfort is Christ. way of Exhortation.
Out of the first Cir|cumstance appeares th superabundant loue o

Iesus toward his owne. He is now entring to his loudy Passion, which troubled him sore, yet he cares not for himselfe, all his care is for them, that they should not be trou|bled. O what a loue!No such loue in the world, as our Lord hath shewed vs. where shall we finde the like of it? Many examples of rare loue haue wee in holy Story, in the com|mon, yea, and in nature also; but none like this: Here is a loue, the length, the breadth, the height, the depth whereof none is able to comprehend.

These are indeede e|xamples

of strong loue inAll these are exam|ples of rare loue, but not com|parable to the loue of Christ to|ward vs. the creature, but as I said, this loue of Iesus ouer|comes them al: he came in the shape of a seruant, to make vs free-men: he was content to be bound, that his Beniaminites, that is, the sonnes of his right hand, might be restored to their Father: he keeps the king|dome as heire and onely begotten Sonne of the Father, and giues the kingdome to vs conque|ed by him, as our Goel insman, who hath redee|med our inheritance: he eceiued in his blamelesse ody the stripes which

were due to our sinnes: He hath borne our infirmi|ties,Esay 53 4. 5 and carryed our sor|rowes: he was wounded fo our transgressions, and bro|ken for our iniquities, th chastisement of our peac was vpon him, and with hi stripes are we healed. He is that Good Shepheard who gaue his life for hi Sheep; he is that true Pel|lican, who saw the fieri wrath of God burning a|bout his young ones, an cast himself into the mid|dest therof, that he might quench it; hee knew the terrour thereof, yet hee fled it not; he longed with

great desire to eate that t Passeouer, albeit hee ew it would be a sup|r of sowre hearbs vnto m; for loue of those ho are his, hee forgot mself, when Iudas came  betray him, and the en of war to apprehend m, he made no shift for mselfe: If yee be seekingIohn 18. 8. us, I am hee, let these goe ir way. And here when e is to vndergoe his ublesome Agonie, all s care is to comfort em that they should t be troubled.

Let not your heart be trou|bled.
THE third Circum|stance3 Third cir|cumstance, the Com|fort it selfe sufficient against all feare of e|uill which may trou|ble vs. is in these words: and it containes the Comfort it selfe; Le not your heart be troubled I haue fore-warned yo of many things which  know are grieuous vnt you: I haue told you o my suffering, that one o my Disciples will betra me, and that the best o them will deny mee, an that I my selfe must go from you, and whither  goe you cannot com

now. These heauy spee|hes did (no doubt) asto|ish and confound them, nd cast down their harts to the gulfe of excee|ing sorrow: and there|re comes hee in here to ise them vp againe and mfort them. But how|euer the occasion of is Doctrine ariseth of e former premonitions, et we may espie in them compleat consolation, uen vnto vs by our ord, against all that may ouble vs.
There are two euils, e feare whereof trou|les men: first, the feare

of sinne; next, the fearTwo things men feare, Sinne and Death. of death, and that which followes it. The wicked in their life time feare no|thing more then death  Sinne they feare not; yea it is a pastime to them to doProu. wickedly: onely they feare Death and Iudgement they cannot eschew it, al their care is to delay it. InWicked men feare nothing more then death, till death come, then are they vexed with feare of their sinne. their death by the con|trary, they feare nothing so much as their sinne now they flye death, a the center of their sor rowes; then they sha seeke it, as the remedie o their remorses. There i no death so horrible

which they would not illingly imbrace, proui|ed it might free them om the conscience of eir sin; yea, they would e content to be smothe|ed quick; Mountaines fallReuel. pon vs and couer vs.
But the godly in theirBut the godly in their life feare no|thing more then their sinnes. fe feare nothing so much s their sinnes: they ourne for former sins, nd with good Ezekiah, ecount them in the bitter|esseEsay. of their soule: they ght against present sins, anding with the armour f God vpon them, and rough his grace ouer|ome it: they are in con|tinuall

feare of sinne t come; if it renew the for they are still making pre|paration to resist it. AnAnd there|fore feares no death when it comes. therefore they feare n death, at least are not  uercome with the fea thereof; they defie it, the prouoke it, they preue it; I meane, they know will come, but ere it con they desire it, and are pr|pared for it ere it be pr|pared for them. Sime sight makes them sing  meons Song; Now Lor let thy Seruant depart peace: and they resol with S. Paul, I desire to dissolued that I may be wi

Christ. But indeed feare|full is their estate, who at one time haue to fight oth against the terrours of sinne, and horrour of death. It is a godly po|icie in the spirituall war|fare, to diuide your ene|mies; first ouercome your sinnes, vanquish them ere he forces of death can oyne with them; so shall ou not be afraid to en|ounter with death; for Death is a biting Serpent, nd Sinne is the sting ereof: take the sting from the Serpent, and without danger you may mbrace it. Take Sinne

away, and Death shal n be terrible.
Against both these |uilsCompleat Comfort against both these feares gi|uen here. the Lord Iesus he furnisheth vs with suffi|cient comfort: against th feare of sinne hee sets th buckler of Faith, whic is able to quench the fie|dartsEphes. 6. of the Diuell, in thes words, Yee beleeue in Go beleeue also in mee. Again the feare of death, th graue, and all that may follow them, hee sets th meditation of these hea|uenly mansions prepare for vs: and in respect o both, premits the com|fortable Exhortation, Le

t your heart bee trou|ed.
For vnderstandingNo exemp|tions from trouble promised to Chri|stians. hereof wee must con|der two things: first, at our Sauiour here omiseth vs not exemp|on from trouble: next, at hee requires not we ould be without all nse of trouble. The first euident, he hath plainly ld vs, In the world youChrisost. in. Mat. hom. 7 all haue affliction: If any an will follow me, he must ke vp his crosse  follow ee. It is a prettie obser|tion of Chrisostome, so one as our Lord was orne, Herod persecuted

him and slew him in  members, the innoce infants; so soone agai as he was baptised, Sat tempted him: to teach  that if wee be such Ch|stians, as in whose he Christ is conceiued a formed, wee must loo for persecutions fro men, for tentations fro Satan. As a shadow fo lowes the body (saith M|carius) so Vbi Spiritus, Macar. hom. 15. Neyther is it required that Chri|stians should haue no sense of their trou|ble. persecutio  pugna. T second is as cleare: if  should be without sen of trouble, where we the praise of Patience? fo what commendation is 

 suffer that which grie|eth thee not? this were orse then Stoica , is beastly stupiditie, not mmended for a vertue, t condemned for a ce, Thou hast stricken em, and they haue not rrowed.
But the meaning of theBut onely that their hearts be not ouer|come of trouble. xhortation is, howso|uer it be that sore trou|les be abiding you, and at the sense of your ouble will be grieuous  you also, yet , Let ot your heart be sha|en and perturbed with , so that you quit your

comfort and confiden in mee. Here then is t victorie of a Christia that no trouble can oue come his heart: his goo may be stolne, his na be slandered, his bo may be killed, his co|science may be racked his heart may be shak and sore moued, but ca|not be remoued, becauThe inuin|cible heart of a Chri|stian can|not be o|uercome with in|ward ten|tations. it is fixed on the Lord, h Spirit dwels in it, and b secret grace vpholds i Inward temptations can|not do it, vnder these it  the voice of Saints, whic once was vttered by pati|entIob.

let not your heart be trou|bled. Magnum enim fort dinis fundamentum est,Cyr. in Ioan. cap. 14. mus non turbatus, ani autem nondum supernaf datus gratia, timidus,  stabilis nimium est. A g ground of fortutude i heart not troubled, therwaies it not bee|stablished with heaue grace is out of meas fearefull  instable: the fore the Apostle when blesseth the PhilippiaPhil 4. prayes, that the peac God which passeth all |derstanding, may prese their hearts: so shall  the heart be troubled.

But here it is demaun|ded,Seeing our Sauior was troubled himselfe, how saies he to vs, let not you hart be troubled? how requires our Sa|uior of vs that we should t be troubled, seeing was troubled himselfe? testifies this same E|vangelist, , Now is my le troubled: and a|in, when Iesus had said ese things, ,Iohn 12. 27. Iohn 13. 21 hee was troub| in the spirit:  more significantly is the same pressed by S. Marke,Mar. 14. 33 en hee entred to his a|ny in the Garden, , hee began to be a|nished, and transpor|ted:

the words impor strange motion,  scar|ly vtterable, which sense of that wrath  to our sinnes, wrou in the Lord.
The answer is, the trou|bleThe trou|ble of Christ far different from ours. of our Lord was fa different from ours, b in the end,  in the ma|ner or measure there for hee was troubled, the end hee might kee vs that we should not troubled with that trou|ble which was due to  sinnes.1 In the end thereof.

No, it is impos|ble: None but hee tro the wine-presse of  wrath of God: Let  flesh be silent heere, a reserue him his ow glory.

And now to conclu this first point of t comfort proponed way of exhortation as  began it, let vs remark t louing care of Iesus t ward his owne, that pro|uides the comfort or uer the trouble coSometime the Lord giues com|fort before the trouble come.

First against the terrors of sin, ext against the terrours f death, arma quippe his inistrat Iesus Discipulis is, quibus queant omnia perare aduersa, for inCyrill. in Ioan. ese few words our Sa|uiour furnishes armor to is Disciples, by which ey may be able to o|uercome all contrarie ings whatsoeuer.

Against sin our Sauio sets the bulwarke, or ra|ther1 Faith in Christ is set against the fear of sinne. as the Apostle cals i the Buckler of Faith, whi is able to quench the fie darts of the Diuell. As thEphes. 6.

It may be confirmed by learning  long experience, but  not at the first begotten by any of those, Sentit antequam discitur, we feeCyp. lib. 2.

And it is wrogh by rypening grace, no by length of time, no greatnesse of knowledge
That therefore wee be not deceiued in so great  matter as is faith, the only

remedy giuen vs heere a|gainstNo com|fort against sinne, and wrath, but by true Faith, and what need we haue to try it. the guilt of sin, and errour of the wrath to ome, let vs ponder that recept, try your selfe if you e in the faith. There is a ith which S. Paul calls nfeined, to distinguish it om faigned faith, called2 Cor. uely and laborious, to di|stinguish it fro~ that which Iames calls a dead faith.  there were but one kind  faith,  euery man had,2 Tim. 1. ere needed no such pre|pt, try if ye be in the faith, ut since it is not so, it ly|hIam. 2. euery man in hand, to oke to himselfe, that he mbrace not a false faith,

Leauing to discusse aFaith three manner of wayes de|scribed. length of Faith, wee wil shortly consider the na|ture, and the threefold o|perations thereof. S. Pau1 It is a sub|sistance of things ho|ped for. cals it, , A reall subsistanc of things hoped for: an so Faith is called not for|maliter, but effectiue, be|cause it maketh things2 It is an e|uidence of things not seene. hoped for after a sort to be present. Againe, he|cals it, , The euidence oAug. in Ioan. tract. 68. things not seene; Fide

redit quod non videt: nam  vides, non est Fides; Faith eleeues that which it ees not: now wee walke2 Cor. 5. y Faith, after this wee all walk by sight; when ght shal come Faith shal ease. Thirdly, hee cals it ,Heb. 6. 19. The Anchor four soule sure and sted|st,3 It is the anchor of our soule which holds vs fast that we driue not away with the winde of tentations. which entreth into at which is within the aile. This world is fi|ed by the Spirit of God y a Sea weltring and ormy, our soule and onscience in it is likened

to a Ship rossed to and fro with many contrary windes of restlesse tenta|tions: the Anchor which keepes vs stedfast that we be not driuen away with the winde, and preserue vs sure that we sinke not vnder the waues, is ou Faith: the Rocke where|upon it fasteneth the gripes thereof, is abou within the vaile, the Lord Iesus: the Cords or Ca|bles that holdeth sure to|gether the Ship and the Anchor, are the promises of Gods mercy made with this three-fold vni|uersalitie, of all sinnes, all

times, all persons, Repen|ance intervening. This funiculus triplex qui non cile rumpitur: that three|ld cord, which is not fily broken: were the ormes of our life neuer  deadly, wee haue this omfort, we may be mo|ed, but cannot be remo|ed: we may be sore tos|d, but cannot suffer ipwracke, our Anchor fastned not vpon sand  slipping ground, but pon the Rocke, it will t come home to vs, but ill draw vs home vn| it.
Therefore Philo spea|king

of Faith, calledFaith how commen|ded by Philo. , The onely su seale and infallible goo , The solaPhilo lib. de Abrahamo. of our life: , The fuln of good hopes: , The auer of euils:  but the bringer of good. The learned recDefined by Scult. Theologs expresse t nature of Faith by t definition; Fides est fi|ciaScultet. idaea conci|on. in Deum plane filia concepta ex agnitione Ch|sti,  amore Patris,  homo in amplexum Dei r  ait Abba Pater: Fa

a filiall confidence in od, conceiued of the owledge of Christ, and  th loue of the Father him, whereby man nneth vnto God, and yeth vnto him Abba ther.
Of this is euident theIn faith there is a twofold working power. o-fold operation of ith: first, there is in faith apprehending vertue,1 An appre|hending Vertue.  which the beleeuer re|iues and applyes to selse Iesus Christ, as is offered in the Word2 A randring vertue. d Sacraments. Second| there is in Faith a ran|ing vertue, (so to cal it) hereby the beleeuer

goes out of himselfe int the Lord. By the fir Christ becomes ours: b the second wee resig our selues vnto Chris and become his: Qui cr|dit in Deum, transit  Deum; the phrase in m significant manner im|ports thus much, that who beleeues in God passeth out of himse into God, hee become partaker of the diuine n|ture:Pet. hee liues not an more in himselfe, b Christ liues in him, an makes him say with t Apostle: Now thankes  to God I liue, yet not I, 

Christ liueth in me: for by ith he being planted in hrist Iesus draweth sap  grace from him, which akes him to become ch as Christ is, and to nder vnto him the fruit  his owne plantation, ost acceptable to him.
These then are the twoThese are the two hands of Faith, by the one it giues, by the other it receiues. nds of Faith: by the st it receiues from God, y the second it giues vn| God: this is a point t commonly marked  this age: many would ioyne these two, which od hath conioyned to|ther, as if Faith had but e hand for receiuing,

and not another for gi|uing: they thinke ther is no more but to receiu mercy from God, forge|ting that by the sa Faith they must rend sonne-like obedience t their Father. This is n Faith, but presumptio Infidelis fiducia, faithle confidence. For why, b|leeuest thou that God become thy Father? a|prehendest thou him be so in Christ? then shThey who haue not the ren|dring ver|tue, had neuer the appehen|ding ver|tue. mee that thou hast re|dred thy selfe to be  sonne: let mee see his mage.

which workes in the the similitude of his ow life. Here is the miser of this age, that a cou|terfeit Faith is currant |mong many, who co|tent themselues with it,  if it were a true faith.





Verse 2.
In my Fathers house are many dwelling places: If it were not so, I would haue told you. I goe to prepare a place for you.

_HItherto haue2 Comfort confirmed against the feare of Death. we been com|forted against the feare of ne; followes now com|t against Death. Wher| the Lord confirmes vs ainst the offence wee ght conceiue of his ath, and against the ter|rs might arise of our ne death, and that

which may follow it.
This comfort pro|ceedesThis com|fort pro|ceedes by three de|grees. by three degrees In the first is proposed meditation of the man Mansions which are i our Fathers house. Th comfort meetes our fea this way; if death afra you, if the graue see horrible to you, if it yerksome to rememb that which Iob hath; E1 The first degree of comfort a|gainst death and the graue, is the me|ditation of heauenly mansions. it be long I must make  bed in the darke: I will  to corruption thou art  father, and to the wor|yee are my brethren and |sters; lift vp your minde looke ouer this stream

at seemes to carry all ay with it, cast your es vpward to my Fa|ers House where many ansions are: Death all not be able to de|ure you, the graue shall t detaine you from ese euerlasting Taberna| where the place of ur rest and Mansion This is the first degree the Comfort, and is ntained in these words.Death a compend of all crosses hath need of the greater consola|tion. As Death is the way of flesh, so is it the com|nd of all crosses: in it e soule naturally is ubled with feares, the dy with paines. It is

the last enemie, which g thereth all forces mi|tant vnder it, to the la battle. It is with vs as was with Israel when th came out of Egypt, o nation of the Egyptia pursued them, but wh they entred into Cana seauen nations of Can|nites ioyned their forc to hold them out. In o life euery man hath h seuerall crosses and tent|tions: one hath health  body, but wrestleth wi pouertie, not hauing  feede his body: anoth hath abundance, but hat not his health to vse i

some want sight of their eyes, but heare well e|ough: others see, but eare not at all: one is ained in his outward lesh, another with some ntestine disease: in one here is a whole body, but  wounded Spirit. If inIf it be dif|ficult to beare one crosse in our life, how shall we beare many con|curring in our death without preparati|on. ur life wee gather not trength against one crosse or two, how shall ee endure in death to ight with them all? Wert hou neuer so rich, poore nd naked thou must goe to the graue; arme hee against pouertie, earne to want those things which thou hast,

before they be taken from thee: were thy sight as quicke as the Eagles it shall waxe dimme, TheyEccles. 12. 3. shall waxe darke that looke out at the window: the strong men shall bowe them|selues, and the grinders shall cease, c. Thy senses shall faile thee, yea, thy heart also, thy beautifull flesh must putrifie  rot, thou must goe to the house ofVerse 5. thine age; and all that are thine shall for sake thee. In a word armtes of sorrowes,Lam. 2. 22. feares and terrours, as in a solemne day, shall be gathe|red round about thee. And therefore great need haue

wee to arme our selues a|ainst that day of battel, nd specially to lay vp in ur hearts these consola|ons of God, which our auiour here leaues vs in is Legacie.
In this first degree ofThe first degree of comfort hath in it foure cir|cumstan|ces. he Comfort foure cir|umstances are to be con|idered: first, who is this e cals his Father: second|, what is his Fathers ouse: thirdly, what are hese mansions: fourth|y, what is meant here by any mansions.
As for the first, the ame of a Father is either ttribute to God indefi|nitely,

and so is common1 First Cir|cumstance, who is this whom Christ cal|leth his Father. to all the three person of the blessed Trinitie, in which sense, among the rest of the stiles giuen vn|to Iesus, hee is called, a euerlasting Father; anEsay 9. then the relation respectThe name of Father how it is attributed to the three per|sons, and how to the first person onely of the blessed Trinitie. eth all his creatures: o else particularly it is a|scribed to the first person and then the relatio doth principally respec Christ, and that in bot his natures. Secondly; al the children of his good wi to whom by grace i Christ he is become a fa|ther. Most comfortable i this for vs, that he who i

he Father of our Lord esus Christ by an vn|eakable generation: for ho can declare it? is also ecome our Father in im: I ascend to my God, nd your God; to my father, nd to your father. And hen wee pray hee hath ommanded vs to call pon God as vpon our ther; yea, he hath sent owne his Spirit into our arts by whose secret in|rmation we are taught ith filiall confidence to y vnto him, Abba Fa|er. Happy time for vs, at so wee may call him.
The second Circum|stance

leades vs to a con|sideration2 Second Circum|stance, what is this he cal|leth his Fathers house Esay 66. 1. 1 Kin. 8. 27 of his Fathe house; The heauen (sait the Lord) is my throne, an the earth is my foot-stool where then is his house yea, as Salomon saith, T heauens, and the heauens  heauens are not able to co|taine him: the Lord is uery where, exclud from no place, includ in none: to them in hHow hee hath a spe|ciall house, whose pre|sence is e|uery wher, in earth, in hell, in heauen. hee shewes his terrour, t them on earth he shew his goodnesse, to them i heauen hee sheweth h glory, what then is th hee calleth his Fathe house? This speech 

borrowed from the man|ner of Kings, who albeit the whole Kingdome bee theirs, yet haue they some place of residence, which more properly is called the Kings house: euen so by this house, which our auiour calleth his Fa|thers house, is vnderstood that place of glory wher|n he shewes his secret  most familiar presence to his Saints: this is the house2 Cor. 5. not made with hands, but eternall in the heauens: this is the Citie hauing a foun|dation,Heb. 11. 10 whose builder and maker is God: this is the Citie which needeth not SunReu. 21.

nor Moone. This is the Pa|radise of God, the innerA com|mendation of our Fa|thers house Court of the palace of God, the heauen of heauens, the holy of holiest. S. Pau calls it, the third Heauens; hee saw it, but could not reueale the glory of it; he contents him to tell what it was not, but takes not in hand to tell what it was  he describes it negatiue, wee shall know it when wee shall see it; till then no heart of man can vnder|stand it. The Christian by course hath residence in three houses: The first was his mothers wombe, there hee soiourned by

moneths. The second is this world, wherein hee oiourneth by years. The hird is heauen, wherein re the euerlasting Taber|acles: and there the chri|tian shall dwell for euer. Of this comparison will ppeare the glory of our hird house, wherof who o pleases to reade more, s likewise of that com|ort we haue of this, that God the Father of our Lord Iesus, is also become ur Father in him, may ee it at greater length in ur treatises on the eight o the Romanes, and De|fiance of Death.
The third circum|stance3 Third cir|cumstance what is meant by Mansions, to wit, in|durance to all eter|tie. is in the word Man|sions, and it imports the endurance and eternity of that house, and them which dwell in it: it is no soiourning house, no place for pilgrimes, but our mansion place The earth is stable and moues not, yet all things in it are in a continuall motion, wee neuer stand in one e|state: from the womb our course is to the graue without any resting. The heauens are againe in a perpetuall motion, and yet aboue them hath the Lord prepared our man|sion.

That petition of the Church is a meet prayer r vs; O thou whom myCant. 1. ule loueth, shew me whereThere the great shep|heard re|steth and feedeth his flocke, but not here. ou eedes, and rests at the one day. Here the Lord edes vs, but heere the ord rests n~ot; heere is ght, but not the light of e noone day. No, no, e Sunne in his meridi| light, extends not so rre, the morning twi|ght, as the lightsome ory of our mansions ceeds the greatest glo| man can haue in his lgrimage. As the great ies of Campania seeme t litle cottages to them

who stand on the top the Alps,  as the moo couereth her selfe with pale vale, and shineth n at all in presence of t Sunne, so all the beau and glory of this eart shall vanish, when that gl|ry of the Sons of God sh be reuealed.
Miserable worldlinFolly of worldlings who seeke their Man|sions, wherethey cannot re|maine. haue no care of a place  these mansions, as if could be obtained wit out care, but beyond  measure they care for t place of their pilgrimag as if their care could pr|cure the continuan thereof. What greater fo

y then this? Suppose thy ossessions were as sure s the earth to remaine with thee and thine after hee to the worlds end, rt thou also sure to re|maine with them? No: in ne houre, wherein thou ookest least for it, it will e told thee, O foole this ight they will take away hy soule from thee.
But in truth thy posses|onsTheir por|tion on earth came from one  shall goe to ano|ther. are most vnsure, hey came from another and vnto thee,  thinkst hou so to tedder and re|eiue them, that from hee they shall not passe o another. S. Paul his

Paul, who protests hee ad deliuered to the El|ersActs 20. 27 of Ephesus, the whole ounsell of God: and yet it recorded of him, that hen he opened his cause  the Iewes and Brethren f Rome, Hee preached toActs 28. 23 em concerning Iesus, out f the Law of Moses and of e Prophets: yet are the duersaries so shamelesse  to affirme, that though ow the Euangelists and postles be ioyned with oses and the Prophets, et in all their writings e counsell of God, con|cerning

But admit it were a they say, that all thing needfull for vs to know were not told vs by ou Lord and his holy Pe men. Who is hee that able to reueale that whi the great Angell of t Couenant, the Doct  Prophet of his Chur hath not reuealed? T last Booke of holy Scr|ture, is the Booke of t Reuelation, it is come fro the right hand of that |ler, who sitteth on t Throne. S. Iohn saw closed with seauen seal

This ame may wee say of all he remanent Bookes of oly Scripture; the Lamb ath loosed to vs the Seales of them all: hee nely hath opened and euealed them vnto vs. And if any part of the ounsell of God needfull o be knowne for saluati|n, be yet vnsealed  not

reuealed to vs, I pray them tell vs who is he i heauen or in earth, wil do that which the Sonne of God hath left vndone It is a blasphemie again the Sonne of God, to say hee hath not taught v that which is needfull fo vs, or that any other shal come after him to reueal that which our Lord hath not reuealed vnto vs.
And no lesse iniuriouThe perfe|ction of his Priest|ly office is no lesse certaine. Heb. are they in this, that they dare derogate from the sufficiencie and perfecti|on of his Priestly office. Hee hath offered himselfe once, and once onely, and

that for all his owne, a ropitiatorie sacrifice, for the full satisfaction of his Fathers Iustice: yet are not they ashamed to say, that hee hath satisfied for vs onely in a part,  that which hee hath not done must be supplyed by our owne satisfactions, or of others for vs. But if these gnorant men had but a taste of that bitter cuppe which our Sauiour drank for our sinnes, the horror whereof made him to sweat a bloudy sweat, they would feele and be forced to confesse that it were impossible for any

creature to make satisfa|ction to diuine Iustice fo the smallest sinne tha euer was committed by man. Neyther can thi blasphemie be excuse by this pretence, that ou workes and sufferings be come satisfactory by th vertue of Christs merit for the meriting and satis|factorie power of Chris is personall; Hee hath byHeb. 1. 3. himselfe purged our sinnes Hee transferres to hiOur Lord transfersto his Saints the benefit of his me|rit, but not the vettue of meri|ting. Saints the benefit of his merits, but not the power of meriting: that is the glory of a Sauiour, which hee reserueth to himselfe

and will not giue to ano|her. And as it is perso|all, so it is perfect: hee ath in such sort done his worke for vs by him|elfe, that he hath not left ny part thereof to bee one or supplied by ano|er: for which wee haue at most cleare testimo|ie of the holy Oracle: ee is able perfectly to saueHeb. 7. 25. l them who come vnto od by him.

He longs to hau

Alas, that wee are bewitched with the pleasures of Babel, and do not long as we should to see our Fathers house, that wee may be for euer with the Lord.



I goe to prepare a place for you.
THe second degree of2 The seco~d degree of the com|fort, is a considera|tion of the right wee haue to these hea|uenly man|sions. the comfort is in these words: the disciples and others his Saints might haue said, Lord, it is ioyfull for vs to heare of thy Fathers house, and of the many Mansions which are in it; but what is that vnto vs? what right or interest haue we in it? To this doubt, the Lord opposeth this se|cond degree of comfort; wherein that which hee spake generally in the

first, hee applies particu|larly to them: the Mansi|ons of my Fathers house are for you and such as you are: I shall make you a right vnto them; for this cause came I into the world; for this cause goe I vnto my Father, that I may prepare a place for you.
This comfort is mostWithout this, the first degree of comfort could not availe vs. And why? necessary: for what auails it vnto vs to heare of the ioyes of that life to come, and of the glory of that kingdome, vnlesse wee know, that it belongs vnto vs? The wicked hea|reth tell of it, but shall

euer see it, yea, they may st of the powers of the life come, but shal neuer en|y them. These are cur|d with a curse more arefull than that of the amaritan Prince, hee be|eued not the word of e Lord, spoken by Eli|a the Prophet, that Sa|aria then straited with amine, shold haue plen| of victuall vpon the orrow; thou shalt see with2 Kin. 7. 2. ine eyes, but shalt not eat ereof, said the Prophet. o is it with the wicked, ey shall see the Sonne f man come in his glory, ut they shall not be with

In this second degFoure words to be conside|red in this second de|gree of comfort. these foure words are  be considered. First sai our Sauiour, I goe, nam|ly, to my Fathers hou Secondly, wherefore?  prepare. Thirdly, what  prepare? A place. Fourt|ly for whom? for you.

Againe, it is to be oAs the death of our Saui|our, so the death of Saints is but a go|ing to our Father. serued that our Sauio speaking of his death, c it a going to his Fathe S.

The doctrine of thComfort|lesse is the doctrine of the church of Rome co~cerning death.

But no lesse cruell andBut more comfortles and cruell are they when they send down infants vn|baptized, to a house of hel, bap|tised by themselues and called Infernus no~ baptizatoru~ merciles are they toward young children dying without Baptisme: for these, if the want of Bap|tisme be not supplied by martyrdome, they con|demne to another house of hell, which they cal infernus non baptizatorum the hell of such as are no baptized. Our Sauiour commanded to bring th young children, and sai of such is the kingdome 

heauen, but these new do|ctors will banish young ones from him, and grant them no place in his king|dome. S. Paul saith, that children of beleeuing Pa|rents are holy, being born within the Couenant; but the Pope sends them downe to a house in hell, for want of the seale of the Couenant: But be|cause they still bragge of Antiquity, we wil let you heare the voyce of Anti|quity plainely against them.This cruell opinion is condem|ned by Augustine.
First, of this purpose Augustine writes in this manner. Proinde respu|endi

sunt a corde Christi|ano, qui putant ideo dictum multas esse mansiones, quod extra regnum coeloru erit aliquid, vbi maneant beati innocentes, qui sine Baptis|mo ex hac vita emigrarunt, quia sine illo in regnum a|lorum intrare non poterunt. Therefore they are to be reiected, yea, spewed out of a Christian heart, who thinke, because our Saui|our sayes, there are many Mansions, that therefore without the kingdome of Heauen, there is some place, wherein blessed innocents, dying without Baptisme shall remaine,

because without it theyLet Ca|tholique Romanes consider what fals Catholicks they are in Augustine his minde. cannot enter into the kingdom of heauen: Haec ides non est fides, quia non st vera  Catholica fides: This faith is no faith, be|cause it is no true Catho|ique faith. Dare ye so di|ide the house of our Fa|ther, that some Mansions therof ye make to be in the kingdom of heaue~, others of them without the king|dom of Heauen? Absit vt ui volunt habitare in regno oelorum in hac stultitia ve|int habitare vobiscum: Far e it from vs, that they who would dwell in the kingdome of heauen,

should dwell with you in this foolish opinion.
With Augustine agreethWith Au|gustine agreeth Bernard. Ierem. 1. 5. Bernard: I read, saies he, that the Lord spake of Ie|remie, Before thou came out of the wombe, I sanctified thee: And of Iohn the Bap|tist, Qui ex viero, Domi|num in vtero sensit, who in the womb of his owne Mother Elizabeth was touched with a feeling of his Lord, in the wombe of Marie the blessed Vir|gin;Bern.

The next word here is, of preparing, I goe (saith our Sauiour) to prepare: This leads vs by the hand

But here may be de|manded,Our man|sions in re|spect of Gods de|cree were prepared before the world. Mat. 25. 34 how saith o Sauiour, I goe to prepare place for you? Was it n prepared before the fou|dation of the world? Co ye blessed of my Father,  herit the Kingdome prep|red for you from the fo

dation of the world. The answere is, both these are rue: it was prepared be|fore, and yet is preparingBut in re|spect of the execution of the de|cree, they are still in preparing. till. Distinguish the de|ree from the execution f the decree: in respect f the decree it was pre|ared, in respect of the xecution it is preparing et. And this prepara|on stands in these three; st, in possession: se|ndly, in intercession: irdly, in effectuall ope|tion.
For the first: Christ Ie|sAnd this preparati|on stands in these three. hath ascended vnto auen to possesse it for  and vnto vs, to sease

our nature in that con|quered1 In posses|sing vs in these man|sions pla|ces. Tertul. de resur. carnis. Kingdome. O this Tertullian, in name o all the Saints, gloryeth i this manner: Quemadmo|dum nobis aharabonem Spi|ritus reliquit, ita  nobis a|rabonem carnis accepit,  vexit in Coelum pignus to|tius summae illuc quando redigendae: Securae esto caro  sanguis, vsurpast enim Coelum  Regnum Dei in Christo: As t Lord hath left behind him vnto vs, the earne of his Spirit, so hath h taken fro~ vs the earnest  our flesh,  carried it in heauen, as a pledge th

the whole summe, name|ly, all that are his, euen in their bodies, shall come thither also: therefore O flesh and bloud be glad, and rest in assurance, for thou possessest that King|dome of heauen already in thy head, the Lord Ie|sus Christ.
The second point of2 In interces|sion for vs, that wee may haue the place there, which hee hath meri|ted. this preparation is his In|tercession for vs: Christ is not entred into the holy places which are made with hands, and are similitudes f the true Sanctuary, but s entred into the very hea|uen, to appeare now in the ight of God for vs. Thus

then prepares hee that place for vs, when by his continuall Intercession hee prayes that the plac may be asigned vnto eue|ry one of vs, which he hath merited vnto vs The typicall high PriesAnd this intercessi|on is not generall but parti|cular for e|uery one of his Saints by name. had the names of all th twelue Tribes of Israe vpon his brest, when he appeared before God t pray for them: but ou high Priest knowes parti|cularly by name all h Saints, for whom hee i terceeds: I haue called thEsay 43. 2. by thy name, for thou |mine. Yea, not one knowes hee our person

but all our seuerall infir|mities: For we haue not anHeb. 3. 15 high Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all things tempted in like sort, yet without sinne.
And lastly, this prepa|ration3 In effectu|all operati|on, by which hee drawes vs vp to these Mansions prepared for vs. stands in his effe|ctuall operation in vs, ac|cording as hee promised; And I, if I were lift vp from the earth, will draw all men vnto mee, to wit, all that are mine. Then prepares he that place for vs, when by his attractiue vertue hee drawes vs vp vnto it: Parat quodammo|doAug. in Ioan. tract. 68. mansiones, cum mansio|nibus

parat mansores: The Lord after a sort (saith Augustine) prepares a mansion place, when hee prepares them who shold remaine in it. Ita Domine, para quod paras, nos enim tibi paras,  t nobis paras, cum locum paras,  tibi in nobis,  in te nobis; tu enim dixisti, Manete in me,  ego in vobis: Euen so, Lord, prepare that which thou art preparing, for thou preparest vs to thy selfe, and preparest thy selfe vnto vs, when thou preparest a place for thy selfe in vs, and for vs in thee; for thou saidst, Abide

yee in mee, and I in you.Iohn 15. S. Peter ioynes these two together; An inheritance1 Pet. 1. 4. 5 kept in the heauens for vs, and whereunto we are kept by the power of God through faith. This is for our great comfort, that hee who hath prepared that King|dome for vs, prepares vs for it: hee hath ascended on high, and is now draw|ing vs vp after him. WeIn the My|stical body all the life is in the head, and hee will not faile to draw all his mem|bers after him. speake it of the naturall body, where the head goes through, it will draw the whole body after it: this is much more true in the mysticall body; for whereas in the naturall

body there are moe vitall parts then one, in the my|sticall there is no vitall part but the head: so long as there is life in the head, and that shal be for euer; for Christ is now risen from the dead, and can dye no more, the members shall not want life. Such as are in him feeles vertue flowing fro~ him, to draw them vp to himselfe, to renew and prepare them for these new Heauens, wherein dwelleth righteous|nesse, and into the which no vncleane thing can enter. Aboue all things let vs take heede that wee finde

this attractiue vertue in our selues: for thereby shall wee know that our Lord is preparing a place for vs in these heauenly Mansions.
Now that our SauiourLimbus pa|trum alto|gether e|lumbat, can finde no footing in this place. saith, I goe to prepare a place for you: we haue shewed n what sense hee saith it. And therefore they are farre mistaken who abuse this place, to proue, that the way to the heauenly Mansions was vnpassa|le, and heauen inaccessi|le before the resurrecti|on  ascention of Christ: o affirme the Prolocu|ors on Heb. 9. v. 8. for Babell, that the

Patriarkes  other good men of the olde Testa|ment, were in some other place of rest before the comming of Christ, and not in heauen; and name|ly, that they were in a place called Limbus Pa|trum, which in their mind is the vppermost house of hell. A strange opinion, as if there could be any rest but in heauen, or that soules could haue rest in any house of hell. And with this they abuse ano|ther place of the Apostle to the Hebrewes, The wayHeb. 9. 8. into the holiest of all was not yet opened, while as yet

he first Tabernacle was standing.
For answering where|ofAnother place vin|dicate fro~ the hnds of Papists which they would abuse to proue that none of the godly before Christ, went into heauen. we must know, that the Apostles purpose there, is o declare vnto the He|brewes, that the seruice of the Leuiticall Priest-hood  first Tabernacle, could not of it selfe, giue salua|tion, but figured that sal|uation which comes by the bloud of the high Priest. Now albeit the Leuiticall seruice of it  could neyther saue Priest nor people, yet so many of them as were spirituall, and in vsing of the Typicall sacrifice,

looked by the eye of faith vnto the true sacrifice, be leeuing remission of sin through the bloud o Christ, these were saue by faith in Christ t come, no lesse then we are saued by faith in Chris that is come. And where the Apostle saith, the way to heauen was not open during the time of the first Tabernacle, it doth not import, that the way to heauen was closed all that time, but that it  not manifested then  made so clearly apparen as now it is by the com|ming of Christ: for the

Apostle vseth not the word , which signi|fiethThe diffe|rence of the words  and , declares the way was open then albe|it not so cleare as now. to open that which was closed, but hee vseth the word , which signifieth to make mani|fest and cleare a thing which is darke and ob|scure. Now there is a great difference betweene these two; to say that the way of heauen was ob|scured with shadowes  couerings, which were re|moued by Christs com|ming, and the way to eauen more clearly ma|nifested; and to say, that the way and dore of hea|uen was closed  locked

vp before, til Christ came and opened it: and ther|fore the Iesuites them|selues are forced to trans|late this word as I haue alledged; The way of the holiest was not yet manife|sted. They had the same Couenant of Grace that wee haue, but they had it infolded  couered with figures and shadowes, we haue it outfolded and clearely proponed with|out figure or shadow. The Sunne before his rising sends out a light, where|by any man that hath eyes may see the way wherein he should walke,

but when it riseth, it brings with it a greater light, whereby the way is more clearly manifested. The Lord Iesus before his in carnation sent out a light, which shewed the way of saluation to so many as were appointed for it, and by that light they walked vnto it; but much more clearely hath hee manifested it by his owne comming. These words are abused, when another sense is inforced vpon them.
When Moses testifieth of Henoch, that hee walked with God, and hee was no

more seene, for God tookeGen. 5. 24. 2 Kin. 2. 11. When the Scripture saith, God tooke vp Henoch Eliah into heauen, if the do|ctrine of the Romish Church be true, it must be said, they were carri|ed downe to a house in hell. him away. The Doctors of Rome must make this Commentary vpon it, God took him away, that is, tooke him downe to an house of hell called Lim|bus Patrum, or else they must renounce their opi|nion: and where the Spi|rit of God saith, that E|lijah went vp by a whirle|winde into heauen, these babling builders of Babell will haue it expounded this way; that hee went downe to Limbus: When Lazarus dyed, his soule was carryed by Angels into Abrahams bosome:

now say they that the lace called Abrahams osome is now in heauen, ut before Christs death  was a place in hell, Lim|bus Patrum. But I pray ou what reasonable man ill thinke that holy An|els carry the soules of en vnto another place en that wherein they well themselues? OrigenOrigen. in Iob. riting on that place of b, And naked shall I re|rne, saith in this man|ner; I shall returne thither, here Adam and the rest  mine elders are gone; here the tabernacles of the ghteous are, the rest of the

faithfull, the consolation o the godly; where Abra|hams bosome is, and th company of Angels, the king|dome of Christ, where i light, life and glory, and th sight of God. Darest tho say these things are to b found in any house o hell? Fie, that they are not ashamed to maintain such false and ridiculou fables.
The third word here, is3 The third word in this second degree of Comfort is, A place. what goes he to prepare A place. Not a place o punishment, but as he said before, A mansion place, a place of euerlast|ing rest and ioy. Still th

comfort rises by degrees. O what a mercy is this! f a place were assigned to s according to our de|seruing, the earth would ot beare vs. It is the urse of the wicked when hey dye, they goe downeActs 1. 25.  their place; so was it with Iudas: and when entence shall be giuen ut against them, the rth shall open  swal|low them; but the com|assionGods great mer|cy, that man shold haue a place in heauen. of the Lord, and assion of his Christ, hath eed vs from this misera|ble condition. For our nne we were cast out of arthly Paradise, and yet

the Lord out of his loue hath giuen vs a place in the heauenly Paradise: The Angels lost the plac of their habitation there,  shall neuer recouer it, bu man is raised vp into thei roomes, to sit with ChrisEphes. 2. 6. in the heauenly places.
But the last word com|pleates4 The fourth and last word is, For you. the Comfort, fo you: I goe to prepare a pla for you. It were no mat|ter of comfort to heare o that place, and of th great preparation mad in it, if it were not for vs for as wee shewed in th beginning, our Sauiou here vnderstands not th

twelue Disciples onely, when hee saith, I goe to prepare a place for you: there is one of the twelue ath no place there; IudasActs 1. 15. went to his owne place, and many beside the twelue that shal haue place there, s afterward our Sauiour expounds himself. AlwayParticular application of Gods promises, is necessa|ry for our comfort. wee see it is not sufficient or true consolation to haue a generall sight of eternall life, but a parti|cular application of the promises thereof is neces|sarily required in vs. And this is the very essentiall difference which distin|guisheth true iustifying

faith from all other kind of faith whatsoeuer. Th Papists mistake it farr when they teach there i no more in faith then No|titiaCoster. en|chir. cum assensu, a know|ledge with assent. ForPapists mistake far the nature of Faith, when they take from it this par|ticular ap|plication. suppose thou knowe the promises of eterna life, and assentest to them also, that they are true i the generall, if thou ha not the assurance (which iustifying Faith renders that they are thine, wha comfort hast thou? Th damned Diuels know  confesse the Son of God they know his word  true, both his promises

Iames: where f they thought and as|sented not to the truth of Gods word, it would not moue them at all, neither would they tremble for he iudgement more then they reioyce at the mer|cie. Thus haue these re|probate Spirits, an assen|ing knowledge, then the which no more is in the Papists faith, according to their owne doctrine.
And thus they mista|kingFrom this they fal in|to another inconueni|ence, to de|ny that a man in this life can be sure of sal|uation. the nature of Faith are forced to fall into an other in conuenience, tha in this life no man can b sure of saluation, vnlesse it be by extraordinary re|uelation. Indeed for them it is necessary to affirm this; for it is impossible that their Religion can giue any man assurance of saluation: and there|fore hath their Counsel of Trent decreed in thisConsil. Trid. Ses. 6. Can. 5 manner: Si quis dixerit h|minem renatum teneri ex|fide ad credendum, se cert esse de numero praedestina|torum, anathema sit: If any

man say that a regene|rate man is bound of faith o beleeue that hee is cer|tainely of the number of hem who are predestina|ted to life, let him be ac|cursed. This is their com|fortlesse Doctrine.That a re|generate man may be and is sure of sal|uation is proued a|gainst the Counsell of Trent.
But as hee who liues, eeles life sensibly, and an say, I liue: and hee who hath a Iewell in his and which others see ot, can say confidently  haue it: so the regene|rate man iustified by aith, hauing receiued the pirit of Adoption, cal|led, The earnest of our in|heritance:Ephes. 1. 14.

Charter; secondly, Con|firmation; thirdly, Sea|ing; fourthly, Possessi|on.1 A Char|ter giuen him by the Lord. Our Charter is the word of the Lord, and promises made vs in the Gospell of grace. There s one clause of our Char|ter, As the Father hath ap|pointedLuke 22. 29 a Kingdome to mee, ol appoint it to you. There s another; Feare not littleLuke 12. 32 ocke, it is the Fathers will o giue you the Kingdome. If reprobate man or Angell would quarrell (as no doubt they will in the day of tentation) our ight to the kingdome of heauen, wee should haue

such principall clauses o our Charter, registred i our hearts, to produce a|gainst them, that would disturbe our peace.
Secondly, we haue th2 A confir|mation past there|upon. Lords Confirmation pa vpon our Charter. O this speakes the Apostle  So God willing more abun|dantlyHeb. 6. 17. 18. to shew vnto t heyres of promise, the stabi|litie of his counsell, ha bound himselfe by an oa that by two immutable thing wherein it is impossible th God should lye, wee might haue strong consolation. T Lord hath not only spo|ken the word, but hat

confirmed it with an ath, to shew to the heires f promise, these are re|generate men, the stabili|e of his counsell: let the aduersaries marke this. Beside this, the death of e Testator hath inter|ened, and hath subscri|ed the Testament with is owne bloud, and con|firmed it in our hearts by giuing vs his owne Spi|rit, as his witnesse, his arnest and his owne seale assuring vs that the pro|mised saluation is ours. And therefore S. Paul speaking to the Corinthi|ans1 Cor. 1. 6. saith, The testimonie of

God hath beene confirmed in you. Truth it is, many in our dayes, know this Charter, and can speake of it, who haue not the testimonie thereof confir|med in their hearts, but sure his Saints elected, called, and iustified haue it.
Thirdly, wee haue our3 A seasing conforma|be to his Charter. Seasing giuen vs, when his seruants, Preachers of the Gospell, as his Depu|ties and officers, in his name, seases and infefts vs in his promised King|dome: and this is done vpon earth, so oft as they deliuer vnto vs in the

holy Sacrament, that read which is his body, hat wine which is his loud. A donation reall s made to vs of Christ, and of all that which hee hath conquered vnto vs, that which generally is proposed in the word, particularly is applyed in the Sacrament to euery true, penitent, and belee|uing receiuer: for it is not a naked signe or symboll which there is put into our hands, but an effectu|all exhibiting instrument of Christ Iesus, and of all that by his death he hath merited vnto vs.
Last of all, we haue pos|session4 Possession. of it, not onely as wee said hath hee carryed our nature into the hea|uens,  possessed it there, but hee hath deliuered to vs the keyes of the King|dome, Faith and Prayer, by the which, when wee knocke, hee openeth, and giues vs euen in this life, an entrance to it, that we may after a sort view and behold the glory thereof, as Moses from the top of Pisgah viewed Canaan:  this is a present pledge of that future redemption of the possession abiding vs hereafter, when we shal

more fully inioy it then ow we can.
Thus haue wee seene inAnd yet no man hath this assurance at all times in a like measure. a part what sure and vn|doubted warrants, Saints called and iustifyed, haue of their saluation; yet it is to be obserued, that this assurance continues not with them alway in a like measure: they are ma|ny a time exercised with doubtings,  desertions, for their greater humilia|tion: but this is sure, true Religion approues no doubting, farre lesse pre|scribes it, but rather im|proues it, and by strong arguments taken out of

the word, strengthens Faith, and remoueth all causes of dubitation fur|nished by infidelitie. But that I may eschew repeti|tion, he that lists may read this matter entreated at greater length on the eight to the Romanes, where we haue also pro|ued that Saints called once by grace, and iusti|fied by Faith, are sure of finall perseuerance.





Verse 3.
And though I goe to prepare a place for you, I will come againe and receiue you vnto my selfe, that where I am, there ye may be also.

_FOllowes now3 The third degree of comfort against death is the consi|deration of the meanes by which we shal be aduanced to our hea|uenly man|sions. the third de|gree of the Comfort. The isciples yet might haue aid; Lord, it is a great omfort to heare of the any Mansions which re in thy Fathers house, greater yet to heare that hou wilt goe and pre|pare them for vs; but this

this is still the matter o our feare, we are clothe with mortall and corrup|tible bodies, which short|ly must be turned into dust and ashes, and with in them wee haue sinful soules, how shall we the be able to inherit these Mansions? To this ou Sauiour answeres; I wil come againe and receiue you, that where I am, there yee may be also: your ascend|ing vp to the mansion places of my Fathers house, is not a worke to be done by you, or by the power of nature: it is a work to be done by me,

I will receiue you, and noIt is the worke of Gods po|wer, and not our owne. power of the grue, of the earth, nor of hell shall be able to hold you from mee. For this cause when the Apostle had prayed for the Ephesians, that God would open their eyesEph. 1. 18. 19. and let them see the riches of that glorious inheritance prepared for the Saints, he subioynes incontinently another prayer, that God would open their eyes to see that exceeding greatnes of his power toward vs that beleeue. These two are requisite for our com|pleat comfort: first, to know the greatnesse of

that promised glory: next, to know that the great power of God will bring vs vnto it, Hee will performe his promised king|dome.

And to this same pur|poseBy Augu|stine. saith Augustine: Is it not more admirable to see heauenly Spirits bound and detayned in earthly bodies, (which we know by experience) then that earthly bodies should be raised vp into heauenly places? And againe disputing against the Platoniques, who from

the naturall waight of the Elements, reasoned, that no earthly body could be in heauen, hee saith;Aug. de ci|uit. Dei. lib. 22. cap. 4.  cap. 11.

power to be carryed in|to the Ayre, cannot giue to the body of man made immortall, that vertue, whereby it may dwell euen in the highest hea|uens? And againe saith hee; Seeing man by hisAnd seeing man ma|kes heauy things to float in the water, can|not our God carry vp heauy bodies to heauenly places? artifice can make heauie earthly bodies swimme aboue in the waters, why contradict wee the word of the Lord our God, promising to vs that our heauy and earthly bodies shall be carryed vp into heauen, and this mortall shall put on immortalitie, and this corruptible shall put on incorruptibilitie? yea,

our bodies shall be made like to the glorious body of Christ, that is, as Theo|doretTheodor. dial. 2. cap. 23. obserueth, , in respect of qualitie, not of quan|titie: for in respect of quantitie our Lord shall exceede vs as farre as the light of the Sun exceedes the light of the Starres.

TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, Vertuous, and Godly Lady, Dame Eliza|beth Kar, Lady Broughtoun.
MADAME:
_HAuing neere at one time, brought out these two Treatises, like wo twinnes: the one intrea|ing of Heauenly Mansi|ns, the other of Patience.

The eldest of these two, I haue committed to the patro|cinie of the right Noble La|dy, the Countesse of Mar, the second for many reasons, doe I dedicate to your L. Grace hath ioyned your harts together in one holy band of mutuall loue in the truth, which I trust these Treatises may serue some way to con|firme, no way to dissolue: for they contend not one with another, as did the two twinnes Iacob and Esau, in the wombe of Rebecca, but rather cherish one another; yea, without the one the other cannot consist.
The Heauenly Mansions

cannot be obtained without Patience: neyther can Pa|tience be preserued without looking to the Heauenly Mansions. The practising f Patience now, leades vs o the full possession of the heauenly Mansions here|fter. In these I am sure and your greatest comfort, without which all comforts f the world are but deceit|ll vanities.
It is true, Nature hath ought you out Honourable  concerning this life, the ister germane of a right oble Lord, The Lord oxbrugh, the Spouse of  Honourable Knight,

Sir Iames Bellenden: but All the glory of flesh is as the flower of the field; Onely the word of the Lord endureth for euer. And herein is your greatest glory, that by the immortall seed of the Word, ye are made the daughter of the liuing Lord begotten againe to an in|heritance immortall, vn|defiled, and that fadet not away. This is one po which greatly magnifies th prerogatiue of Grace abou all the priuiledges of nature that the one euanisheth, th other endureth. All coniun|ction on earth shall suffer dissolution, except onely th

coniunction of a soule with God in Christ. And this euen in your young yeares hath God taught you by sowre ex|perience. It is now about ten yeares since death diuorced ou from your naturall hus|and: yet in this time did ot the Lord forsake you: hrough his grace yee haue eene an Abigail to that ouse, whereunto your God did bring you, that is, a mo|her to it, by wisedome more hen common to your sexe, rocuring the good thereof: nd haue liued like that wid|ow ANNA, seruing the Lord, confessing him in his Temple, a diligent hearer of

his word, to the good exam|ple of others who wait for the redemption of Israell. Which (with many moe) as hitherto they haue beene eui|dent in you, to your great commendation before the world, so I pray God these, and all other graces of his Spirit, requisit to your eter|nall saluation, may be multi|plyed vpon you for your ap|probation before the Lord. To whose mercy both now and euer I commend you And rests

By your Patience possesse your soules.

_THis Exhorta|tionTwo parts of this pre|cept. short in words, but rich in matter, renders to vs a two-fold instruction: first, it lets vs

see what is it in all our1 Possesse your soules spirituall warfare the ad|uersarie pursues, and the Christian hath to defend, to wit, the Soule: next, the armour recommended to vs whereby we may best defend the soule, namely, Patience.
The Soule is the mostThe soule is the most excellent part of man. excellent part of man; vn|der it, saith Augustine, is comprehended the whole inward man, wherebyAugust. de Eccles. dog|mat. cap. 34. this masse of clay is quick|ned, gouerned, and kept together, changing her names according to her sundry offices and opera|tions in the body: whe

shee quickneth the body,It hath sundry names ac|cording to her sundry offices. shee is called the Soule, Anima; when shee hath appetite or desire to any thing, she is called the Wil, Animus; for knowledge shee is called the Minde; for recordation, the Me|morie; for iudging and discerning, she is called Reason. The soule was not made of the Elements as other creatures are, that it being free from composition, might also be free from corruption, whereunto other crea|tures are subiect. God breathed into man a li|uing soule, said Moses,

thereby declaring, that hee created a spirituall immortall soule, which he breathed into the body to quicken it.
That the estate of theThat the estate of the soule depends not on the estate of the body is cleared. soule depends not on the body, experience proues for in weake and withered bodies the soule is more quicke and pregnant of|tentimes then in stronger And that it is also of an|other nature is euident; for where the body by small things is easily sur|charged, and so filled that it can containe no more; such is the superexcel|lencie of the soule, that

no mortal thing can con|tain it. It rauished Nyssenus with admiration, when hee considered, Quae sitNyssen. de opifici. hom. cap. 10. interioris nostrae capacitatis amplitudo, in quam omnia per auditum infusa influunt,  in qua visu recepta re|rum apparentium simula|chra, formis certis depin|guntur? What is the am|plitude of our inward ca|pacitie, into the which all things infused by the eare floweth, and wherein the images of all things seene by the eye, are contained and pictured in their owne formes?
But by the contrary,

the good estate and well|fareBut by the contrary, the good estate of the body depe~ds on the good estate of the soule. of the body depen|deth vpon the good e|state of the soule: keepe it, and keepe all; lose it, and lose all: Nobilem hospitem habes,  Caro,  tota salus tua dependet de eius salute: O Flesh, a noble Guest hast thou within thee, and all thy good estate de|pends vpon his good e|state: thinke not shame to dishonour thy selfe, that thou maist honour him; nor to disease thy selfe, that thou maist ease him. Neglect him not because hee is a stran|ger, but consider dili|gently,

Quid hospitis huiusBrn. praesentia tibi largiatur: what great benefits thou enioyest by his presence, and what losse thou shalt sustaine by his absence: when hee goes from thee thine eye will see no more then the clay, thine eare will heare no more then the stone, thy body shall lose all the beauty it hath now; yea, no member thereof shall doe the own office. Et si tantum tibi confert exul,  in terra pe|regrina, quantu~ tibi praesta|bit in patria? And if thou hast so great benefits by it in a strange land, what

shall it doe to thee when it gets thee in her owne Countrey.
Yet such is the beastlyThe beast|ly igno|rance of many, who knowing all things, which they know by the soule, yet scarce know that they haue a soule. ignorance of man, that albeit hee feeles the life he hath by the soule, and findes by daily experi|ence, that the body lo|seth life when the soule leaueth it, yet hath he no care of the soule,  doth not so much as remem|ber it once in the day. And therefore our Saui|our who knoweth our soares better then our selues doe, recommends to vs this care, Possesse your soules; and he teaches

ow wee may doe it, by our patience. God is the God of Patience, keepe atience and thou shalt eepe the Lord; and in eeping him shalt keepe hine owne soule. God wels not in perturbati|ns, hee comes to his aints as hee came to E|,1 Kings 19. 11. 12. not in the mighty ind that rent the moun|aines, nor in the Earth|uake, nor in the fire, but ee came to him in a soft nd still voyce: he dwel|ethEsay 65. 2. with the poore, and im that is of a contrite pirit.

the body life from the soule.
In all the battels thenIn all ten|tations Sa|than pur|sues no|thing but our soule. which Sathan by himselfe or his instruments ma|keth against vs, the quar|rell and question is de ani|ma, about the Soule: It is the soule he pursues, it is the soule wee haue to de|fend: if hee crosse thee in thy goods, in thy body, in thy name, hee careth not for these, none of these are a morsell for his mouth, Animam tuam quae|rit, it is thy soule he seeks, to make it by impatience partaker of his owne con|demnation. A cleare ex|ample

of this we haue in Iob: Sathan by Gods per|missionIf he trou|ble vs in body or goods, it is to get a vantage of the soule. Iob 1.  2. crossed him in his goods by Sabeans, Caldeans, and by a fire from heauen: he crossed him in his children, whom he smothered by the o|uerthrow of the house wherein they were ban|quetting: he crossed him in his body with sore boyles, Et cum aperto cer|tamineGreg. lib 3. in Iob. superari se vidit, de ore coniugis iaculu~ quasi de insidijs intor sit: And whenThis is cleared by Iobs exam|ple. hee perceiued himselfe in open combat to be ouer|come, hee secretly threw a dart at him out of the

mouth of his wife, as it were by boutgates to o|uerthrow him. What hee sought by all this, hee de|clares it himselfe, to wit, that Iob might blaspheme the Lord to his face: and the same is it, whereat he aymes in all our outward or inward tentations, that he may carry away and captiue our soules by impatience, that he may driue vs to grudging, murmuring and blasphe|ming of the Lord ourThe re|mem|brance of this should worke strength aginst ten|tation. God. I am perswaded if our memories were san|ctified to remember this, wee would not suffer our

selues to be so easily per|turbed, commoued and transported with passions for light offences cast in our way, as commonly wee are: let vs therefore in all our tentations re|member this watchword of our Sauiour, Possesse your soules in patience, what euer losse wee sustaine of any thing that is ours, take heede wee loose not our selues, but let vs doe as Ioseph did, when the wife of Putiphar caught hold of his garment, that she might snare himselfe, hee let the garment goe and saued himselfe. Such

things as God giues po|wer to man to take from hee, let them goe: and possesse thou thy soule in patience.
But the manner ofA questi|on: how can wee possesse the soule seeing by the soule we possesse all that we possesse? speech is here to be mar|ed, seeing by the soule ee possesse any thing hat wee possesse, for by , we thinke, wee affect, ee worke; what is this, hereby wee can possesse ur soules? For answere, e must know that in the oule of a Christian man here are two contrary arties, one regenerate, an|ther vnregenerate: light, race, and sanctification

in the one: darknesse, cor|rupt nature, and sinne in the other; whereby let no man thinke that the soule is diuided or parted intoThe an|swere of this que|stion. two halfs; for it is a simple and indiuisible essence. But as wee see the twi|light of the morning, it is neyther full darknesse, as at midnight, nor full light, as in the noone-tide of the day, yet is it one  the same light, though it increase by degrees clearer and clearer till the noone, then it was in the morning: So is it with the soule of a Christian, it is not altogether darke|nesse

as the soule of the wicked and reprobate is, whose night is not past; yea, the darknesse of their midnight wil neuer passe, but still it waxeth darker and darker till they come to vtter darknesse. Ney|therHow in the soule of a rege|nerate man there are two contrary parties. yet is it altogether ight, as the soules trium|phant are, who rest and feede with him whom their soule loueth, in the oone-tide of the day; but it is throughout all partly regenerate, partly nregenerate. No faculty of the soule is without the remanents of ignorance and sinfull corruption,

nor yet without begin|nings of knowledge and renouation by grace. And these are the two which S. Paul cals, The new ma and the old: sinfull cor|ruption is called the old man, because it was in v before renewing grace  and againe, because i waxeth weaker and wea|ker, till grace vtterly a the length abolish it. ThiOf this the mea|ning of the pre|cept is made plaine. then being the estate o our soule, the meaning o the exhortation is, tha we should fortifie the  part, euer endeuourin that light may banis darkenesse, Grace in th

oule may subdue sinfull orruption, and the new an may ouercome the ld man, till at length hat vsurper Sathan bee ully dispossessed, and we possesse our soules as a quiet habitation for the God of peace and of pa|ience to dwell in.
Againe, seeing the A|postleGod is the immedi|ate superi|our  pos|sessor of our soules and bodies. 1 Cor. 6. 19 20. speaking to Chri|tians saith, Ye are not your wne, yee are bought with  price; therefore glorifie God in your body and in our spirit, for they are Gods: how are wee com|manded to possesse our soules, seeing they are

not our owne? The an|swere is easie: our imme|diate superiour and pro|per possessor of our soules and bodies is the Lord: wee hold them of him, as tenants at his will, not for our selues but for the Lord. As hee is a traitorSeeing we hold them of him, it were trea|son to ren|der them to his ene|mie. who renders the Palace or castle of a Prince which hee hath receiued in kee|ping, to the enemie of the Prince: so is he who casts open the ports of his soule to euery vncleane spirit,  giueth the mem|bersRom. 6. 13. of his body as wea|pons of vnrighteousnesse vnto sinne. Thus then we

are but vnder-possessors of our soules and bodies: as wee hold them of the Lord, so should we hold them for the Lord. Farre be this rebellion from vs, to hold the Lords owne house against himselfe.
Besides this, AugustinesHe is pos|sessed, and not a pos|sessor, who possesseth not him|selfe. bseruation here is wor|hy to be remembred. Our Sauiour saith not, ossidete villas vestras, sed ossidete animas vestras: Possesse your villages, orAug. de temp. ser. 223. uch like, but possesse your soules. The men of this world glory in their externall possessions, but s Cyprian said of them:

Non intelligunt miseri pos|sederiCyp. lib. 2. epist. 2. se, potius, quam pos|sidere: These miserable men vnderstand not that they are rather possessed by their riches, then pos|sessors of them. Onely theOnely the Christian is to be e|steemed a rich man. Christian is a man of great possessions, and he holds them all by these three graces, Faith, Loue, and Patience: by Faith hee possesseth the Lord, and all his benefits: by Loue hee possesseth his neighbour, and all th good that is in him; he re|ioyceth in it, as in hi owne: by Patience again hee possesseth himself

And without these, thogh thou wert as rich as Crae|sus, thou art but poore: for what canst thou be said to possesse, who art neyther a possessor of thy selfe, nor of thy neigh|bour, nor of the Lord thy God?
This is a necessary do|ctrineHow need|full this doctrine is for this age. for this age, where|n men are out of mea|sure carefull; yea, conten|ious for the smallest hing which is theirs, but ltogether carelesse for hemselues: they are rea|dy to resist him that would wound their bo|ies, and resolute to fight

for the least thing which is theirs, onely when the oppressor of the soule in|uades it, no contradiction is made to him. Oh that they were wise to ponder that warning of Moses  S. Paul, Attende tibi, takeWhich ca|reth for a|y that is theirs, but not for themselues. heed to thy selfe! art not thou thy selfe much more worth then anything that is thine? If thou be so carefull for that which thou accountest to be thine, how is it that thou forgettest thy selfe? Et siAugust. de temp. ser. 223. tanta suffert anima vt possi|deat peritura, quanta debet sufferre, ne pereat ipsa? An seeing the soule endureth

such labour that it may possesse perishing things, what should it endure, that it perish not it selfe? O sonnes of men, Quidern. serm. 4 vobis cum diuitijs, quae nec verae nec vestrae sunt? si vestra sunt tollite ea vobis|cum: What haue yee to doe with these riches, which are neyther true, nor yet yours? if they be yours take them with you. But still they dreame with that foole, that their soules are full when their bodies are full: Now my soule thou hast enough for many dayes, said hee, but a few dayes proued hee

Mart. in dialogo cum Tryph. in Christianos adhibita fuerint, eo plures alij fideles comparantur, quemadmo|dum si quis partes Vitis prae|cidat, vt aliae fructuosiores rursus germinent: The sharper punishments be vsed against christians, the

more is the number of faithfull ones encreased: as men cut off the bran|ches of the Vine tree, that others more fruitfull may come in their roome, so is it with the Church Who knowes not saith Cyprian, how the corne of the Church hath brought out most abundant en|crease, being watered with the bloud of the A|postles and other Mar|tyres? Quo plus sanguinisCyprian de duplnart. effusum est, eo magis efflo|ruit fidelium multitudo, hoc latius sparsit suas pro|pagines illa beata Vitis  Christo stirpe surgens: The

greater quantity of bloudThe bloud of Martyrs the seed of the church. was shed, the more flou|rished the multitude of beleeuers, and the more largely did that blessed Vine-tree, springing from the roote Christ Iesus, spread out her branches. For this cause said Tertul|lian, that Sanguis Mar|tyrumTertull. est semen Ecclesiae: The bloud of Martyres is the seed of the Church. And this the Aduersary is forced to confesse, that albeit in the Primi|tiue Church there were as many thousand Chri|stians as were able to haue giuen battle to the

persecuting Emperours, yet they had rater ouer|come by patient suffe|ring, then violent shed|ding of the bloud of any other: Ita vere Catholi|cosCost. encir. pia quaedam tenuit mi|sericordia: Such was then the tender compassion of true Catholikes.
But how vnlike theThe cruel|ty of the Romane Church shewes it to be Anti|christian. Church of Rome now is to the Church Primi|tiue, let any indifferent man discerne by their fruits. If they bee the flocke of Christ his sheep, what is the cause their teeth are so bloudy? QuidCyprian de simplicitate Praelat. facit in pectore Christiano

Luporum feritas,  Ca|num rabies? Should the fiercenesse of Wolues, and fury of Dogges be in the breasts of Chri|stians? Were not such Wolues and Dogges, actors of that Tragicall Murder of Paris, and plotters of the Powder-Treason? Thus euen their workes doe bewray them. It is a shame to shrowd such beastly cru|eltie vnder a Christian name: It is a double sinne to couer the iniuryMalach. vnder the garment of God. This may well proue them successors to Ro|mane

Persecuters, but not to the patient suffe|rers of the Church Pri|mitiue: Non enim conue|nitErasm. en|chirid. mili|tis Christ. Epist. ad Volsium. vt hoc argumento nos Christianos declaremus, si quam plurimos occideri|mus, sed si quam pluri|mos seruauerimus: For it is not an argument to proue our selues to bee good Christians, if wee slay many, but rather if we saue many. If wee be otherwise minded, Fie|ri potest, vt citius in Tur|cas degeneremus, quam Turcas in partet nostras pertrahamus: It may come to passe that wee dege|nerate

into Turkes, then draw Turkes to bee of our Religion: For by the shedding of bloud, Fiet vt latius fortasse reg|net Pontifex aut huius Car|dinales, non vt latius reg|net Christus: It may beThe Popes Kingdome  his Car|dinals may be aduan|ced by bloud shed|ding, not so Christs. perhaps that the Popes Kingdome, and of his Cardinals, may be en|creased, but the King|dome of Christ by such meanes cannot be aduan|ced: but leauing them, wee returne to our selues. Our Sauiour here fore|warneth his Disciples of great troubles they were to sustaine for his names

sake, the armour hee re|commends vnto vs, is not the Sword; the Pope may vse it, because Pe|ter did it without a war|rant, but the watch-word giuen by our Lord vnto vs all is, Possesse your Soule by your Patience: This is the weapon whereby I ouer-came, and this same doe I recommend to you.
As the Thunder (saiesPatience compared to the Lau|rell tree, which can|not bee Thunder|slaine. Plinie) ouerthrowes any tree but the Lawrell, so persecution and tentati|on ouercomes any man, but not a patient man. Impatience makes a man

a prey to euery one that pursues him, but hee who hath Patience is inuinci|ble. Euery iniury offe|red to a patient man, re|turneth backe to him that did it: Eodem exitu,Tertull. de Patientia. quo telum aliquod in pe|ram constantissimae duri|tiae libratum  obtusum: No otherway then a dart shot at a hard Rocke, eyther falleth downe blunted, or is beaten backe vpon him, whoImpati|ence the mother of all euill. shot it. Impatientia ex|hedra est omnium delicto|rum: Impatience is the receptacle and right lod|ging place of all sinnes:

Malum enim est impatien|tia boni: For euill is but the impatience of good: who would commit ad|ultrie if hee were pati|ent of Chastitie? Patien|tiaIbid. vero Charitatis est fir|mamentum: Ira, Discor|dia, Simultas, locum in pectore non habent, in quo dominatur Charitas: But Patience is the sure kee|per and stablishment of Charitie: Anger, Dis|cord, Hatred, haue no place in that heart, in the which Charitie ouer|rules: Though all the world were against such a man, hee resteth quiet

in his owne minde, and possesseth his soule in Pa|tience.
Where, by the con|trary,Impati|ence driues a man out of his vvits. the impatient man at euery light offence is carryed out of his owne wits, and put beside himselfe, and becomes like one who teareth hisIob 18. 4. owne soule, as Bildad spake of Iob. Hee that would see the right Image, and liuely portraiture of an impatient man, let him consider this Historie set downe by Saint Marke: There met him a man, whoMar. 5. 5. 6. had an vncleane Spirit, who had his abiding among

the graues, and no manThe image of an im|patient man. might binde him, no not with chaynes, because that when hee was often bound with fetters and chaynes, hee plucked the chaynes a sunder, and brake the fet|ters in pieces, neyther could any man tame him. Both night and day hee cryed in the mountaines and in the graues, and strucke him|selfe with stones. But here is the great inconsidera|tion of men: A man this way bodily possessed, is pityed of all that behold him: but though hee be spiritually possessed, and oppressed by the enemies

of his soule, to raging, railing, blaspheming, whoring, and all sort of impietie, who doth re|gard it? Alwayes, to re|turne great is the praise of Patience, that it makes a man possesser and ma|ster of himselfe.
The reason of this is,Patience is neuer a|lone with|out the rest of the Graces. because Patience is ne|uer alone, all the rema|nent Graces of the Spi|rit frequent the Palace of Patience, there are they preserued, and en|tertayned. As vices are linked together, so are Vertues: they march in battle against the spiri|tuall

enemie, in comelyThe order how Gra|ces march in the spi|rituall war|fare. order, after this manner: Truth goeth before, and leadeth them, bearing in her badge, the Lanterne1 Truth, with Fore|sight and Feare. of the Word, to shew them the way wherein they should walke a|gainst the Prince of dark|nesse: At the one hand of Truth stands Fore-sight, as in a Watch-tower, euer looking out to dis|couer the approaching of the enemie: at the other hand stands Feare, with this watch-word in her Banner, Walke circum|spectly. In the second rancke after Truth fol|lowes

Faith foot for foot;2 Faith, with Loue and Holinesse. for Faith followes No de|eiuable Fables: and Faith hath in the right hand the Sword of the Spirit, and in the left, A Buckler able to quench the firie darts of the Diuell. Vpon the right hand of Faith stan|deth Charitie or Loue; for, Faith worketh by Loue, and Loue carries in her Banner The complement of the Law: on the other hand stands Holinesse; for The Heart is purified by Faith; and Holinesse bea|eth in her Banner The Image of God. In the third rancke, at the backe

of Holinesse stands Humi|litie,3 Thse are attended by Humili|tie an  Meeknesse. hauing in her badge the similitude of a man mortified and dead with Christ. Beside Humilitie, at the backe of Loue, standeth her sister Meek|nesse, bearing in her badge the similitude of a Lamb. In the fourth rancke stan|deth Patience, Domina Philo de congressu, c. regina virtutum: the La|dy and Queene of Ver|tues,4 Patience bearing the Stan|dard. bearing a high Stan|dard, not vnlike that of of Constantine the Great, hauing in it this name, , with this Dictum, , for in Christ, and through him Pati|ence

ouercomes at the length. In the fift rancke, at the backe of Patience stands Experience: for, Patience brings forth Ex|perience;Rom. 5. and Experience5 Experience with Hope and Forti|tude. beareth in her badge an open written Booke, con|tayning a Register of the Lords manifold former deliuerances: Experience hath vpon the one hand Hope, whose badge is a brazen Piller: and on the other hand Fortitude, in the similitude of an armed man, hauing on his head the Helmet of saluation, and on his bo|dy the Brest-plate of righ|teousnesse,

When Patience is sore put at, and some|what moued out of her place by vehement trou|ble, shee leanes backe vpon the piller of Hope, and Hope succours her with this Dictum, Spera meliora: From Hope shee lookes ouer, and reades the Booke of Experience, whose first Dictum is, Remember the dayes of old: betweene these two Pa|tience begets Fortitude, by whom the battle is a|gaine renewed. In the6 Perseue|rance. last roome followeth Per|seuerance, hauing in her Badge a Crowne holden

vp on high with both her hands, with this Di|ctum, He that perseueres to the end shall be saued. Through all these flyes Prayer like a winged Che|rub.Round a|bout all these flyes Prayer. When Truth is sore impugned, and Faith be|ginnes to faint, Loue lan|guisheth: when Patience is sore put at, and Hope beginneth to houer, or any other of the rema|nent Graces waxes weak, then Prayer goes vp, as a speedy messenger, to the great Captaine of the Lords Army, Iesus Christ, and procures for helpe to be sent from

him, which without fai|ling comes alway in the time of neede. And this is the way whereby the Saints of GOD pos|sesse their Soules in Pati|ence.
Of this it is euident,No true Patience can bee, where Truth, Loue, and Faith, c. are not. that no true Patience can bee, where Truth, Faith, Loue, and the rest of these Graces are not: and therefore the grea|test sufferings of Ethnikes, Heretiques, and others voyd of Faith, Truth, and Loue, are iustly ex|cluded from the praise of Patience: Ethnici multa tu|lerunt animo forti, nulla

tamen cum solida consola|tione: Ethnikes haue suf|fered many things with a strong, or rather an obstinate heart, but with|out any solide consola|tion. Curtius a RomaneAug. de ciuit. Dei, lib. 5. cap. 18. Knight armed and vpon horsebacke, precipitated himselfe and his Horse head-long into a gulfe of the earth, for a good, which in his ignorance he supposed might there|by come to the Citie of Rome: this was fury, not Fortitude. And many other naturall men, out of the like madnesse, to shew their magnanimitie

and stoutnesse of minde,Patience of Eth|nikes is not wor|thy to be called Pa|tience. haue not onely endured horrible paines inflicted by others vpon them, but haue made an end of themselues by poyson, by fire, and many sorts of cruell death: this is not to possesse their soule in Patience: this is not saith Augustine, magna|nimitie,August. de ciuit. lib. 1. cap. 22. but pusillanimi|tie the Daughter of Im|patience, which because it cannot endure, it seekes to eschew that which grieues it. Soli ChristianiCyprian de Patientia. sicut veram Sapientiam, ita  veram habent Patien|tiam: Onely the Christian

as hee hath true Wise|dome, so hath hee true Patience. And of all o|ther Patience, beside Christian Patience, that is true which S. Iames speakes of all other wise|dome:Aug. de temp. ser. 223. Non est ista Pati|entia desur sum descendens, sed terrena, animalis, dia|bolica: cur enim non sit superborum falsa Patientia, sicut superborum falsa Sa|pientia? This Patience comes not from aboue, but is earthly, sensuall, and Diuellish: seeing proud men haue their owne false sapience, what maruell they haue also

their owne false and de|ceitfull Patience.
And of this same na|tureSufferings of Here|tikes in like man|ner are not to be esteemed Patience. is the Patience of Heretiques: they may make a shew of volun|tary Religion in not spa|ring the body, but seeing they haue not the truth of GOD, how can they haue true Patience? The Baalites of Idolatrous Is|raell launcing themselues with kniues: the Gymno|sophists of India, who pine and distresse their bodyes with labour not required at their hands: the Poenitentiaries of Rome (so much boasted

of) who scourge them|selues, and spare not their owne flesh: the foure religious Orders of superstitious men a|mong the Turkes, who in hard vsing of their bodies goe beyond these I haue spoken of: yet are they all strangers from this Praise of Pati|ence. Cum ergo vider isAug. ibid. aliquem patienter aliquid ferre, noli continuo lau|dare Patientiam, quam non ostendit nisi causa pa|tiendi: quando illa bona est, tunc ista vera est: When therefore thou seest any man suffer any

thing patiently, prayse not thou incontinent his Patience, for patient suf|fering cannot bee com|mended, vnlesse the cause of the suffring be known: if the cause bee good, then the Patience is good also.
Circumcelliones, a mostA sort of Heretiques vvho soght the praise of Martyr|dome by murthe|ring them|selues. August. de Haeres. ad quod vult Deum. pernitious branch of the Heresie of the Donatists, were so desirous to ob|tayne by suffering, the prayse of Martyrdome, that they would throw themselues downe head|long from high places, or cast themselues into fire or water: But Augustine

in his learned Disputes,Aug. de temp. serm. 223. pulleth from them the Praise of Patience: Quid miseri faciunt, qui cum non solum impietatis ad|uersus Deum, sed etiam ipsius, quam in se exercu|erunt crudelitatis, luant poenas, insuper  quaerunt Martyrum glorias? What doe these miserable men, who when they suffer punishment of their im|pietie toward GOD, and crueltie toward them|selues, yet out of such suffering seeke the glo|ry of Martyrdome? An impatiens passio coronabi|tur? Shall an impatient

passion bee crowned? Aut quomodo innocens iudicabitur cui dictum est, diliges proximum sicut te|ipsum, si homicidium com|mittit in seipso, quod com|mittere prohibetur in alte|ro? Or how shall hee be iudged innocent, who is commanded to loue his neighbour as himselfe, if hee commit murther in himselfe, which hee is forbidden to commit in another? Si enim parrici|daThe worst sort of ho|micide is selfe-mur|ther. eo sceleratior est, quam quilibet homicida, quod non tantum hominem, ve|rum etiam propinquum ne|cat,  quo propinquiorem

quis necat, tanto imma|nior iudicatur: sine du|bio peior est, qui se occide|rit, quia nemo est homini seipso propinquior: For, if a parricide be so much the more wicked then another homicide, be|cause he not onely slayes a man, but a kinsman, and the nearer the man bee to him whom hee slayes, the more beast|ly is hee that slew him esteemed to bee of all men: then out of doubt much worse is hee that slayes himselfe, seeing there is none nearer to a man, then a man himselfe.
But how is this thatIn what sense Pati|ence is aid to be ours. our Sauiour calleth Pa|tience ours: for so saith hee, By your Patience pos|sesse your soules? Pati|ence is ours, euen as the Soule is ours, to wit, by the gift of God, wee haue it not of our selues; Hee is the Father of lights, from whom descends eue|ry good gift. The Pela|gians of olde attributed this grace to the power of mans free-will: the Papists of our time af|firme the same. But as Augustine said to theAug. d temp. serm. 223. one; Error iste super|bus est: This is a proud

error: so say wee to the other. For, what is the Creature wandring from the Creator, vnlesse the Lord bee mindefull of him; Et eligat eum gra|tis,  diligat gratis: andNeyther Patience nor any o|ther grace haue wee by the po|wer of our owne free|will. choose him of his free grace, and loue him of his free grace? Other|wise, Prae cecitate non vi|det eligenda,  prae lan|guore fastidit diligenda: such is his blindenesse, that hee sees not what hee should choose, and such is his languishing weakenesse, that hee loathes that which hee should loue. Si quis per

naturae vigorem bonumConcilium Arasicau num. aliquod, quod ad salu|tem pertinet cogitare, aut eligere posse aliquem affir|mat abs illuminatione  inspiratione S. sancti, hae|retico fallitur spiritu: If any man affirme, that man by the strength of nature, can eyther thinke or choose any good per|tayning to saluation, hee is deceiued by an Here|ticall spirit. Nulla tibiFulgent ad Gallam vid. facultas inesse potest vo|luntatis aut operis, nisi id gratuito munere diuinae mi|serationis acceperis: There is no abilitie in thee, ey|ther to a good will, or

a good worke, vnlesse thou receiue it by the free gift of diuine com|miseration. Dei est om|neCyp. lib 2. epist. 2. quod possumus: It is GOD who workes in vs both the will and the deede: Falluntur ergo quiAug. ibid. Patientiam tribuunt viri|bus voluntatis humanae, non quas habent ex diui|no adiutorio, sed quas ex libero arbitrio: They are therefore farre deceiued, who attribute Patience to the strength of man, not that which hee hath by heauenly helpe, but that which he hath of his owne free will.
But because wee hauePatience a singular preserua|tiue to keep the heart in peace. at length spoken of Pa|tience, in our Anatomie of a Christian, wee con|tract our selues, and shortly conclude this Our Sauiour hauing fore|warned his Disciples of manifold troubles abi|ding them, armes them against all with this one, Possesse your soules in Pa|tience. Here is a Preser|uatiue able to keepe peace in thy heart, and to banish all perturba|tion. And it serues for all tentations, for all pla|ces, for all persons. Are thy tentations immedi|ately

from GOD? re|member,In tentati|ons in|ward im|mediately comming from God. Psal. 25. 10. member, All his pathes are mercy and truth to such as keepe his Couenant and his Testimonies: his worke can neuer come against his word. The way wherein hee walkes may seeme rough and vnpleasant to thee for a time, but waite thou for the end, and thou shalt see it comfortable. This moued Iob to resolue, Though the Lord would slay mee, yet will I trust in him: and by it Dauid also did strengthen him|selfe in great extremitie of trouble, Why art thou

cast downe my Soule?Psal. 43. 5. and why art thou disquie|ted within mee? Waite vpon GOD: I will yet giue him thankes. In the beginning of the thir|teenth Psalme, how great|ly Dauid was troubled yee may perceiue by his owne words, How long,Psa. 13. 1. 5. wilt thou forget mee Lord, for euer? How long wilt thou hide thy face from mee? But how com|fortable an end his trou|ble had yee may see by the last Verse: But I trust in thy mercy: my heart shall reioyce in thy salua|tion. I will sing to the

Lord, because hee hath dealt louingly with mee. And if thy trouble comeIn tentati|ons out|ward com|ming from men. 2 Sam. 16. 11. 12. from men, remember the answere Dauid gaue when Shimei cursed him: and that which our Sa|uiour said vnto Pilate, Thou couldest haue no po|wer at all ouer mee if it were not giuen thee from aboue. And so knowing it is not man, but God with whom thou hast to doe, Possesse thou thy Soule by thy Patience.
Againe, in all places keepe in minde this war|ning of our SAVIOVR,

Possesse your Soules by yourIn all pla|ces this watch|word should sound in our eares; Possesse your soule. Patience.
