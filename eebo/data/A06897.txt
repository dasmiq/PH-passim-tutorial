Of this our kynge so lyberall,
Seynge he hath all thynges in store
That make to our health eternall?
Our kynge ye saye, is Gods owne sonne
Equall with his father in powre,
whiche from his hyghe throne is come downe
To vanquyshe Satan, that is so sowre.
Of a Mayde pure without mannes sede
Is he borne by ghostly inspiracion,
All our deformyties out to wede
whiche we toke of Adams procreation.
He shall not onely be our kynge
But also our good scole maister, Esa, xxxv. Iohn~, v Iohn~, xi Mathe, xxvi. Marc, xv. Luc, xxii Mathe, xii, xv, xvi, xix, xxi, xxii, xxiii,
Truly teachynge vs euery thynge
That pertayne to a Christen manner.
His godly doctrine he also shall
Uvith myracles approue and fortyfie.
Declarynge hereby vnto all
That he is Messias vnfaynedly.
But the Byshoppes and preestes also
with the Lawers and Pharises,
Scribes, Sadces and many mo
Shall seake all meanes hym to displease.
His sermons they shall callumniate
And his innocency dyffame,
Appliynge nether early nor late

To mayntayne the honour of his name. Luc. . xxiii. Iohn~. viii. x. xviii. Math. xxvi. Marc, xiiii. Luc. xxii Phil. ii, Esa. liii
They shall so encrease in fury
That theyr malice shall neuer cease,
Tll they haue slayne hym cruelly
To satisfye theyr wyckednes.
His owne disciple shall they allure
Christe his Maister for to betraye,
Gyuynge hym gyftes to make hym sure
That from his purpose he go not awaye.
False wytnesse also shall they hyre
Agaynste Christe our true lorde and kynge,
To accomplyshe theyr wycked desyre
That vnto death they maye hym brynge.
After diuers kyndes of torment Psal. xv Ionas. i. ii. Ose vi, Rom, iiii. Psal. lxviii. Esa. lxiii. Marc, xvi. Act. i, i, Iohn~, ii. Rom. viii. Heb. vii Luc. xxiiii. Iohn~, xvi.
wherwith he shall be greatly vered,
To the crosse than shall he be sent
Unto the death to be scurged.
So that the conclusion shall be
That his swete badye shall be slayne.
And his precious bloude shed on the tre
To release all our synnefull payne.
But he shall ryse agayne the thyrde daye
Lyke a lorde puysaunte and bounteous.
That before God the father we maye
Euer appere Iust and ryghteous,
Than to the heauens ascende he shall
Both God and man by his diuine powre,
Syttynge on the ryght hande eternall
Of God the father at eche howre.
For vs shall he without ceasynge
Praye there vnto God his father,
His prayers hereto appliynge
That in grace we maye perseuer.
Moreouer to vs shall he sende
The holy Ghoste from the heauens hyghe,
Uvhiche shall preserue vs vnto the ende

Agaynst Satan our olde enemye. Art. ii, x, Psal. lxviii. Ioel iii. Math. xxv. Phil. iii i. Thess, iiii, Psal. L. clv. Psal. L. xviii,
This holy spirite shall garnyshe
Our myndes with vertues aboundante,
And to abstayne from workes deuylyshe
Grace euer to vs shall he graunte,
At the laste daye shall he agayne
Returne vnto the great iudgement,
The euyll shall he committe to payne
The good to glory shall be sent.
O what a glorious kynge haue we
Howe gentle, howe good, howe liberall,
Nowe blyssed mought Messias be

Fayne wolde we se this our newe kynge
Gladly nowe wolde we hym visite,
For neuer was there any thynge

 But poore I wys

 Be not therfore
Dysmaied the more
Because in store

 And that ye maye

O heauenly noyse and plesaunte syght
O tydynges full of all solace,
To gloryfie God it s ryght
From whom alone procedeth all grace.
The Anglles are nowe from vs gone
Into heauen are they ascended, Luc, ii.
Thorowe theyr tydynges is all mone
Utterly from vs excluded,
Uvhat than doth there yet nowe remayne
But that to Bethlem we make haste,
Aud with our eyes se the tydynges certayne
whiche God hath shewed vs at the laste.
Moche are we bounde vndoubtedly
To this our lorde omnipotent
Whiche of his great grace and mercy
Hath these tydynges vnto vs sent,
Greatly also before all other
Are we sheph rdes poore and myserable.
Bounde to this our lorde and maistr
For these newes swete and conforable,
He hath not openned them to nges
To Byshoppes, to Priestes, to Lawers,
Nor yet to couetous worldlynges Math. xi. Esa. xxix. i, Cor, i, Iac. ii,
But to vs symple and poore mysers,
To vs to vs whiche are counted
Uery slaues before the worldes syght,
Are these ioyfull newes openned
To confoo~de the wycked worldlynges myght,
The wycked worldlynges cannot abyde
This our, newe kynge the lorde Ihesus,

For they reiect and st a syde
Both hym and his worde as venomous.
Herode wyll persecute doubtles
Christe our kynge with great violence, Math. ii Iohn~. xi. Act. iiii.
The Byshoppes, the Priestes, the Pharises,
wyll surely commytte no lesse offence.
The poore in spirite are fytte onely
To receyue Christe and his preachyng,
The wyse worldlynges counte it foly
Ony suche newes abrode to brynge. Math, v. Math, xi.
In worldly goodes is theyr delyght
Gorgious howses are theyr plesaunce
Sumptuousl before mennes syght
To be decked is theyr pastaunce
Delicately also to fare
Is all theyr whole delectacion.
And on the worlde to caste theyr care Luc, xvi
Is theyr whole studye and intencion.
These wycked worldlynges therfore
And belly Gods voluptuous.
Cannot awaye with Christes lore Iohn~. vii.
Althoughe neuer so bounteous
For this cause hath our lorde God sent
To vs shepherdes symple and rusticall,
These newes so good so excellent.
Whiche shall brynge great ioye ouer all. Luc. ii.
Let vs therfore without aryaunce
Go and vysite this our newe kynge
That we maye enioye that plesaunte
whiche the Angell to vs dyd brynge.
Let vs all with humble reuerence
Go vnto our true Messias,
Beholdyng his royall presence
Althoughe in a vile and homely place.
And thoughe we haue no worldly treasure
To offer to this our newe kynge,

Yet let vs brynge hartes meke and pure
whiche shall be to hym well pleasyng.
Hartes full of fayth and charite
To Christe our kynge let vs offer,
Beleuynge truly that this is he
whiche is our kynge and Redemer.
In hym alone, in hym alone
Let vs put all our confidence,
Let vs scake saluacion at none
But onely at his diuine presence
Let vs loue hym vnfaynedly
With a true hart and faythfull mynde,
Seakyng euermore his glory
whiche is to vs so gentle and kynde.
To god the father omnipotent
whiche of his mere mercy and grace,
Hath vnto vs this treasure sent
Let vs lyue worthy his ayndnes
In all our lyfe and conuersacion,
And suche wyse sake hym to please
That we maye ane the heauenly mansion.

AMEN.
Gyue the glory to God alone.
