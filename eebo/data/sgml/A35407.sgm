<HEAD>I. Of Favour and Eminency in Court or State.</HEAD>
<P>_HE that stands by, and ob|serves the supple Ad|dresses, and sedulous applications of the Court, how greedily wise men sell their li|berties, and sacrifice their time unto it, with what patience they undergoe at|tendance, more grievous then pil|grimage, must needs imagine that to be a sacred mystery, which deserves such superstition; nor can he expect lesse than the Philosophers stone, where he sees so many furnaces set on work, and such rare Alchymists engaged.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">He that marks the pomp and splendor of eminent men, the solemnity of their visits, the exactnesse of their ceremonies, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stre of their Equipage, cannot but be enamoured of so rare a scene, wherein each person acts a part of greatnesse, and every day seems to be festival.</P>
<P>He that examines the Grandeurs of <HI>Moecenas,</HI> the lofty flights of Favourites and chief Ministers; how they manage the reins of the Common-wealth, whilst Princes only sit in the saddle; how they give Laws to the people, signals to the souldiers, example to all; how all their vertues are magnified and multiplied, and even their errours with veneration concealed, with what ease they trample upon their adversaries, and preferre all their dependants, how can hee, re|frain from d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">awing at so fair a Lottery, or escape those delicious charms, which would almost delude a Stoick, to mi|stake them for his <HI>summum bonum.</HI></P>
<P>But, alas, these are only outsides, to amuse the ignorant, these stately scuth|eons serve but to hide a dead corpse, and these excellent odours to perfume a se|pulchre:
<PB N="3" REF="7">
The factions wherewith every Court and State is perpetually pregnant, The Envy and Emulation, which though not so loud, is yet perhaps fiercer then open war; The spies, which (like Eu|nuchs) are set upon all mens actions, and behaviours, to observe and report them to jealous Powers; The keen and po|stilent slanders and censures, by which even innocency is ensnared, or at best, perpetually alarmed, These are not pre|sently discovered, and indeed, fit it were, they should be concealed, lest we avoid Courts as persons in debt do pri|sons, and dread greatnesse like infe|ction.</P>
<P>It falls not within the compasse of every ones notice to observe how Gran|dees make a prey of inferiours, like fry in a fish-pond; and how the inferiours again, though emulating each other, yet with a secret spleen conspire unanimou|sly against the Favourite, like little bea|gles to pursue the Royal Stagge.</P>
<P>All are not sensible of the slippery e|state of great men; with what slender props those magnificent structures are
<PB N="4" REF="8">
supported, How brittle and fungous their greatnesse is, they being exposed, besides infinite other uncertainties, even to the saciety of their masters, who commonly delight in nothing more, than by chan|ging their Minions and servants, to ex|ercise the wantonnesse of Soveraignty; were but this duly considered, I am perswaded men would rather content themselves with the freehold of a Cot|tage, than grasp at Palace<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, where they are but tenants at will.</P>
<P>Few have the wisdome to foresee, how hard it is in greatness to pursue honest, and safe maximes, what resolu|tion is required for the Potent to be in|nocent, what Providence to bee so ac|counted; what sordid interests they are forced to espouse, and by what insensi|ble degrees they are brought at last to swallow those actions and compliances, without chewing, which at first, they looked upon with loathing; But alas, proceed they must, and in their stations apply themselves to serve the designs of their masters, for Princes will not en|dure that their Ministers shall dispute
<PB N="5" REF="8">
their pleasures. When it was proposed by <HI>Henry</HI> the third of <HI>France,</HI> to <HI>Gril|lon</HI> Captain of his Guard, that he, as the fittest instrument, should dispatch the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Guise,</HI> the honest, but blunt souldier freely profest, that he was rea|dy, if commanded, to fight with the <HI>Duke</HI>; But to murther him un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onvi|cted, would not stand with his honour, being born a Gentleman, and professing Arms; which answer coming from one that was a sworn enemy to the interests of the house of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> deserves to be recorded to his everlasting praise; Yet though <HI>Grillon,</HI> that refused, was the wor|thier man, <HI>Lognac,</HI> who greedily ac|cepted the employment, seems to have been the wiser Courtier; The one, ex|posing himself to all the hazards of mis|construed vertue, the other, endearing himself to his Prince, by the pledges of guilt and odium, the greatest engage|ments of future confidence. For it was observed of <HI>Seianus,</HI> that his favour could not be purchased without some notable crime. If this were sufficiently weighed, such, I presume, as love ver|tue
<PB N="6" REF="9">
would not so precipitate themselves into publique affairs, where interest is seldome preserved without a shipwrack of conscience.</P>
<P>But besides, as the snares, hazards, and anxieties of great men are innu|merable, so their Eclipses are fatal, and their falls desperate; They are always surprised with ruine, and their defeat is like that of Legions, when they are cut in pieces before they can rally or make head. Private men oft times fall upon their legs, and finde friends to relieve, or at least pity them. Even Bankrout Merchants are daily seen to rise again, like Phoenixes out of their own dust: But with Courtiers and Statesmen, there are no degrees of misfortune; Their best comfort is not to survive their de|stinies, and their greatest misery is, when they outlive themselves, to see their fa|milies buried in their ruines, and all the advantages of their honour and for|tune, turned against them, like an Ar|my dissipated with the fury of its own Canon. Whilst they finde themselves forsaken of all those alliances which
<PB N="7" REF="9">
they had, with so much wisdome, con|tracted, imagining to have laid a foun|dation of everlasting greatnesse, whilst their best friends shun them most, and those that were rais'd by their counte|nance, dare not own any love or honour to their persons, lest they be likewise invol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n their crimes; whilst their innocency is as it were proscribed, and impeachments finde such favour in their regard, that their own servants are en|couraged to betray them; Their ene|mies triumph over them, and all their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ontemporaries think to exercise their charity in affording them a kind of in|solent pity; The people which pro|bably hated, but feared them before, are now priviledged to curse them, and the Prince himself, in whose service per|haps they bleed, uses them as the skreen of envy, and hoping with their ruine to gratifie many, and please all, becomes inexorable.</P>
<P>In fine, they have no sanctuary to protect them, having long since forfeit|ed their innocency, the sweet retrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of oppressed vertue: Were our gay spirits
<PB N="8" REF="10">
herein awakened, they would not so court danger as they daily do, but would rather learn to hugge themselves in a mediocrity of fortune.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>II. Of faithful Ministers to unthankful Princes.</HEAD>
<P>It is no new thing to see the greatest vertue and merit mis-construed, and persecuted, even by those that owe i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> most favour and protection. History is full both of the fatal rewards of wor|thy service<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and tragical resentments of oppressed innocency. Even <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth of <HI>France,</HI> notwithstanding the absolutenesse of his power, and clearness of his fame, was observed hardly to brook any, that might seem to share with him in his Lawrels; The piety and wisdome of King <HI>David</HI> himself seems to be scarce exempt from such jealousie in the behalf of his kinsman <HI>Ioab,</HI> though covered with the speciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="9" REF="10">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> seasonable pretence of a Royal and ex|emplary Justice.</P>
<P>Whether it be, that excesse of desert turns at last to a kind of demerit, whilst Princes apprehend, that they cannot sufficiently requite it without impover|ishing themselves; Or whether soveraigns are apt to look upon the lustre of their subjects actions, as an Eclipse of their own; Or lastly, whether they think their Authority endangered by those whose eminent&punc; Vertues have drawn the eyes of the people, or hearts of the soul|diers towards them, so that nothing seems to restrain them, but their mode|sty, which in the great, is ever justly su|spected; It is indeed but too evident, that Monarchs more willingly pardon great injuries, than great services; That they as ill endure the name of a Benefa|ctour, as of a Rival; And by the ex|ample of <HI>Galba,</HI> can least of all brook such as may seem to challenge the merit of their establishment. He seems too po|tent a subject that hath trod upon a dia|deme, and possibly he that hath once re|nounced a kingdome, may yet upon se|cond
<PB N="10" REF="11">
thoughts repent of his moderati|on.</P>
<P><HI>Machiavel</HI> could invent but two sorts of remedies for so imminent a mischief; The first and more excellent, hee faith, is to yield to the torrent, by assuming no honours, arrogating no triumphs, entertaining small retinue; Finally, by taking all occasions to sleight their own atchievements, that so all glory may flow to the Prince, as to its Oceans, with|out the interruption of Mils or Dams; But since Vertue being the disease, Loy|alty seldom proves the cure: His next and safer counsel is, not to trust too much to innocency, merit, or present appearances, but to be as jealous as their masters, like Ravens, to smell Gun-pou|der at a distance, to lie perdieu for their own safety; And upon the first disco|very, to be before-hand with danger, to make use of the utmost advantages they are trusted with, to assure themselves of timely retreats and confederacies, that preventing fraud with fraud, and repel|ling force with force, they may be in a condition not only to stand upon thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="11" REF="11">
guards, but take revenge of their ma|sters ingratitude, and perhaps if need be, set up for themselves.</P>
<P>Truly, if we look upon the Counsel of this great Politick with the eyes of nature, above all things concerned in its own welfare, it seems to be a friendly whisper, an admonition full of prudence, and favourable to vertue; it teaches men to determine resolutely of their af|fairs, to cut off parboyled fear, and fro|zen delays, to hope even in despair, and to prevent preventions. Thus we read of <HI>Getulicus,</HI> that warned through the numerous examples of his masters rigor, by a kind of prudent disloialty, he secu|red himself, and of all <HI>Seianus</HI> his de|pendents, alone survived so bloudy a scene. Thus <HI>Agrippina,</HI> observing a change in the countenance of <HI>Claudi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> towards her, scarce thought her self a|live till he was dead.</P>
<P>Surely such unworthy practices are a foul reproach even to moral vertue, much more an infinite scandal to Reli|gion, especially Christian, with the bare profession whereof they cannot
<PB N="12" REF="12">
consist. <HI>Germanicus,</HI> albeit a Heathen, was a better proficient in true wisdome, who being at once exasperated by the undeserved malice of his Uncle, and tempted both by the loud applause of the people, and entire obedience of the Legions, yet chose rather to expect the Empire with danger, than with safety to possesse it, and preferred the envy of vertue before the security of a crime.</P>
<P>But what shall we think of great <HI>Bel|lisarius,</HI> disgraced, deprived not onely of liberty, but even of light, without conviction of the least crime, even by that great Law-giver <HI>Iustinian,</HI> whom his single vertue had rendred almost as great a Conquerour as <HI>Iulius Caesar?</HI> What shall we say of the great Captain <HI>Gonsalv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> for feigned crimes in default of real, neglected and ruined by the same <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> the foundation of whose greatnesse was laid in his sweat and va|lour, not to say, his overmuch Loyalty, which tempted him even to break his faith for the service of his Prince? Or what shall we account of the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> who though he found feet to
<PB N="13" REF="12">
trample upon the weaknesse of unhappy <HI>Flemmings,</HI> yet had not a heel to lift up against the just power of an unjust ma|ster? What shall we think of these and many others, that have chosen rather to be innocent, than great or safe? Shall we believe they wanted either wisdome to discover, or courage to resent the cruelty of their Soveraigns? Or, shall we not distinguish their integrity, even with rubrical Characters, from the treason<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and insolencies of <HI>Sylla, Catiline, Nar|ses, Bourbon, Guise, Wallestein, &amp;c.</HI> who suffered themselves to be enforced by o|dious necessity&punc; inveigled with wicked caution, or with treacherous opportu|nity debauched.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>III. Of Fame.</HEAD>
<P>THough the Stoicks are to be much commended for their excellent I|deas of Vertue, their generous contempt of the body, and indifference in outward things, yet they seem with too much
<PB N="14" REF="13">
ostentation to undervalue Fame, even de|crying vanity with a kind of vain-glory. Certainly there is no reason why Vertue should altogether sleigth its own eccho, or such as professe the study of Immor|tality, despise that, which in surviving its subject, and outrunning time, hath at least some feature of Immortality.</P>
<P>It seems rather an heroical device of that noble <HI>Brederode,</HI> who lived at the be|ginning of the Low-Country warre, and worthy to be added to the dignity and antiquity of his coat of Arms, <HI>God pre|serve my soul and my honour</HI>; it expres|sed a lively endearment of his renown, since he thought it only worthy to bee mentioned with eternal happinesse; it proved, that he had Vertue in the high|est veneration, since he stooped even to kisse the hem of her garment.</P>
<P>I confesse, where Fame and Vertue are inconsistent, we are obliged, as it were, to save the V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l from shipwrack, by lightning the fraught; But this is he severest touch-stone of Philosophy, neither hath conscience a worthier servant than he, who is content to
<PB N="15" REF="13">
espouse her, even with Infamy.</P>
<P>The Scriptures are so elegant in de|scribing the infamy of the wicked, as if they meant to aggravate it beyond any earthly misery, so establishing it, as a kind of unfeigned Purgatory between this world and hell, by these and the like Characters, the memory of sinners shall rot; And again, in the next gene|ration, let his name be extinct; from the latter of which places it is observa|ble, that they then immediatly proceed to blot that name out of the Book of life which they have first raced out of the Register of Fame.</P>
<P>And yet methinks, though Fame may bee desired as a concomitant of more important blessings, surely of it self, as Fame, it seems neither odious nor ami|able, but the most indifferent of out|ward things: When I read the last scene and final <HI>exit</HI> of <HI>Anthony</HI> of <HI>Ven|dosme,</HI> King of <HI>Navarre,</HI> who being mortally wounded at the assault of <HI>Rouen,</HI> by him, with infinite fury and bloud|shed, then taken &amp; sacked, refused the ease and decency of a horse-litter to view his
<PB N="16" REF="14">
lamentable Conquest in a posture of tri|umph, and with this silly, or rather barbarous satisfaction, immediately breathed out his benummed and incon|siderate soul. I would fain imagine him already senslesse, and so not guilty of such sinful Pageantry: But, alas, how many are there, who in the midst of guilt and reproach, to gratifie their childish consciences, can listen to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rattle of applause? nay, how many are they, that to purchase popularity, have sold their peace both outward and in|ward, like that other French-man, who freely hazarded and lost his life, to reco|ver his feather. Vertuous fame, I con|fesse, may be honestly wished, but to gape for it, is a beggarly and sottish am|bition: For as it is no more than worth finding, so it is utterly lost with over|seeking. Both Vertue therefore, and Prudence, require that our pursute of it be moderate and carelesse, like his that rides a hunting to take the air; if h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> spring and catch a Partridge, it is well, but though he misse of Game, hee hath ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> obtained his end, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="17" REF="14">
exercise of his body, and preservation of his health.</P>
<P>Truly we shall finde the lesse encou|ragement to court this seeming beauty, when we consider how light and pro|stitute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he is, and with how little choice she admits her Gallants; All person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and actions that are good or great, are promiscuously entertained, yet the great much rather than the good: Vertues she registers indeed in <HI>Quarto,</HI> but splen|did crimes are recorded in <HI>Folio</HI>; Nay, if we remember how corrupt and inju|rious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he often proves (as being prom|pted by successe) in loading oppressed Justice with Invectives, and dawbing prosperous Vices with Panegyricks, we may perhaps be rather tempted to dis|dain than bare neglect.</P>
<P>Wherefore the motives which encline wise men to value their fame, are not those shadows and dreams of an earthly immortality, nor yet the transportati|ons of affected honour, (for Vertue is no sensual or ticklish quality) but the real advantage it yields of improving their generous designs to publick benefit.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="15">They finde that the Infamous are to some like infected persons and lepers, whom common Providence command<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us to shun, to others like light women, whose company the aw of censure obli|ges us not to frequent, and to all, like such as disgracefully stammer or squint, whom we hear with impatience, and see with as much aversation, as we doe an Eclipse, which by tradition we believe to hurt the eye-sight; that there is nei|ther vigour in their precepts, nor vertue in their examples; since the merit of their vertues being swallowed up in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> scandal of their evil manners, they seem to put on the odious vizard of hypocri|sie, and to do well, in them, at best, is im|puted but to an escape of Custom. They see that even obscure persons where they might perhaps speak with advantge, yield rather to the modesty of secure and harmlesse silence. Again they ob|serve, that such as have once purchased an undoubted fame, are afterwards heard like Oratours, and obeyed like Magistrates; so that the only danger i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, lest their Errours should get the reputa|tion
<PB N="19" REF="15">

proves sometimes so considerable, that scarce any Art or Conduct can supply its defect; Wisdome therefore which weighs all things in the scale of Ad|vantage, will not so undervalue it, be|cause it is vain, as not to cherish it, since it is useful.</P>
<P>It is observable of mony it self, the price of all things, that it was invented only for supply of Credit, ease of Com|merce, and abridgement of tedious barter; that it is only valued for being every where current: And indeed, since a very slender fortune would perhaps satisfie nature and ordinary convenience, Poverty it self were not poor if it were not attended with obscurity and neg|lect; neither can a wise man finde o|ther advantage in wealth, than to afford him the wing of Reputation.</P>
<P>Reputation is (as it were) sinews to the weak, and eloquence to the dumb; It removes obstructions, and answers objections before they are made; Har|bingers are not more necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry to Ac|commodate the Great, nor Pioneers to the Marche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Armies in enclosed

<P>To passe by Merchants, who in a manner breath no other Air, than that of their Credit; I appeal on the one side to all the principal Actors on the Scene of this world, if it have not af|forded them successe without hazard or difficulty; If it have not yielded them advantage beyond hope or fore-sight; If it have not been to them like a porta|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le Bridge, or as a Bridge of Boats ly|ing always ready to transfort them over Rivers strongly guarded, and no where Fortable; On the other side, I ask the unfortunate, and such as have shipwrackt in their honours, if the want of it doe not oft oppresse them beyond any weaknesse of their own, or strength of their enemies.</P>
<P>In the affairs of war, how oft have we seen the wariest Generals rather choose to precipitate themselves upon the Rock of unequal hope, than lan|guish in a posture of inglorious safety, yea, though they naturally feared and abhorred the Critical events of battel,

<HEAD>VII. Of Education.</HEAD>
<P>AMongst the many miscarriages of our times, there seems not to be a|ny of greater importance, then the er|rours committed in the Education of Youth; which yet, having taken root by Custom, are hard to be removed. If we understood the value of good Educati|on, what Vices it prevents, what Man|ners it plants, Parents would not be so indifferent in the discharge of a duty, which imports their Children more, then all the fortunes they can leave them.</P>
<P>There is no nature so fierce, no not that of wild Beasts, but it may be tamed, if endeavoured in Youth; no inclinati|on so violent, but it may be checked, be|fore it take head, and be fortified with habit, all vices being yet as curable, as flesh wounds, whilst they are green; but as we grow old, our faults learn to pre|scribe;

then if the Parent reproves, he is answered with snarling and resistance, if the friend go to perrwade, he makes himself an enemy. The Ghostly Father hath a fine time to wear out his lungs with invectives.

<P>But not to shoot at random, the er|rours, I observe in our vulgar breeding, are these.</P>
<P>First, I conceive, in outward accom|plishments, we study too early and gree|dily to advance our Youth, and, by such out-sides, they commonly are valued; but, as for just and sober principles, the love of Vertue, and restraints of Consci|ence, these goodly and fruitful plants we

<P>Some indeed there are, that judici|ously observe the diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rence, betwixt a sure foundation, and a curious paper-building, or painted Balconey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but then, perhaps, they either think, by flacking the reigns of Authority, to decoy and flatter their youth into Duty, or else, by an over-austerity, will needs precipitat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it into perfection, and cut down tall Vi|ces, like great Trees, with one stroak of the Hatchet, or make Vertues spring, like Mandrakes; both of these are erroneous, for Vertue is the issue of Discipline and Time.</P>
<P>Our Education, in respect of Arts &amp; Professions, seems much like the metho|dical
<PB N="54" REF="33">
Travels of the <HI>Germans</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> which they say, consists in riding a cer|tain tour or Circuit. For first, Chil|dren are put to school at a venture, where they are exposed to the fury of Pedants, and like Galley-slaves, con|demned to the Oar, till dull experience proves them unfit for learning, and per|haps renders them uncapable of other course. When they have learned to con|strue Latine, though possibly, not to un|derstand it, they are either directed to some Trade, wherein that little which they have learned is useless, and soon forgotten; or else they are sent to Uni|versities, Innes of Court, and beyond the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, there to surfeit as fatally of liberty. as starved stomacks do of plenty.

<P>I know it is easie sometimes for fools to censure, what the wis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st men can hardly reform. And withall I am not ignorant, that much hath been written upon this subject, and by m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n whose wits and abilities, I dare not so much as

emulate; yet in a matter of so great and publick importance, I hope, I shall not be too severely blamed, if I adventure likewise in a short Essay, to offer some expedients of redress, to those many mischiefs, which proceed from errone|ous Education.</P>
<P>First then, as the Husband-man with much observation proves the nature of the soyle, before he resolve what grain he will commit unto it, And as the Ar|chitector d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">signes several sorts of wood, for several uses in building: so let not Parents destine their Children to cour|ses, without a diligent sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">utiny and ex|amination of their Genius. Like some z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alous, or covetous Catholicks, who, before their innocent Daughters know what belongs to a vow, bury them, as it were, alive, in Monasteries.

employments, nor excess of melancholy for action; He may prove an excellent Mathematician, that would never be good Lawyer, for that depends upon the strength of Imagination, this of Reason. Great Logicians are oft times but ill O|rators; For the one requires a strong, the other a fine and Courtly wit; some have solid judgememt, some vast memory, some excel in elocution, some in dexte|rity of the Pen, some have quickness of dispatch, some invincible industry. Every Creature is said to have its peculiar vertue, in some kind or other; but the vast bulk of learning, and general abilities, are not to be grasped at, save by such wits, as are almost as rare as the <HI>Phoenix</HI> or <HI>Vnicorn.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, therefore, let every Genius be directed solely or chiefly to those stu|dies and imployments, to which nature first designed them; for that eye which is intent and fixed, sees clearly, whereas variety of objects dazzles; That water, running in one great Chanel, makes a navigable River, which being divided into little streams, they all prove no bet|ter

then ditches. I conceive, if this Rule were practised, Youth would not be so routed and defeated in what they under|take, as now they are, whilst they at|tempt those Arts and Sciences, which are both for quantity too vast, and for quality, improper for them, like Horse|men, commanded forthy to win passes, and take sconces. Whatsoever the sto|mack digests not, proves but crudity; and variety of imperfect notions, serves only to puffe men up with arrogance, and ostentation, and produces at best but learned ignorance, or confident errours. Whereas by this means, every one would thrive in his way, and the Common|wealth of Learning, which consists in perfect societies of all Arts, would ex|ceedingly flourish. The Jesuites, chiefly by pursuing this wise and accurate me|thod, have advanced literature, enlar|ged their own same, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xalted their Colledges, to the envy of all Universities.</P>
<P>Thirdly, let not superficial Orna|ments be so much regarded, as solid foundations, and let not the substance be placed in those things, which were

meant only for glosses and shadows. For though all acco~plishments may be com|mended and desired, yet not all equally, nor alike in all. It were methinks, but vain ambition in a Gentleman, that should strive to excel th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Danoing master, in exactness of Dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing; or the Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ing School<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tivity of body; wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in, if by his indiscreet diligence, and long practice, he should arrive at perf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ction, he were yet in danger, sometimes to re|semble <HI>Nero,</HI> descending from the impe|rial Throne, to play his part in a consort of Musick, and expecting the applause of the people, for his well singing upon the Stage. The <HI>Spartans</HI> were so sev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re in their Philosophy, that they rejected ma|ny of those Arts, which are so precious in our times, as the Canke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of Vertue, and underminers of Liberty, framing mens minds, rather to the pomp of vici|ous pleasures, then the simplicity of ver|tuous exercises. Their censure herein may perhaps be too rigid, yet we should remember the debt we owe to publick, and to posterity, and not resemble our <HI>Virginia</HI> Planters, whose poverty forces

them to plant nothing but Tobacco and other Commodities of present vent; we should use a more excellent Husban|dry, like those that bend their designes to set up manufactures, to settle Trade, to establish policy, and turn a Colony in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o a Common-wealth, by such well-grounded and durable Arts, that future times may reap the ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fit of our indu|stry We should therefore prize vertue and innocency in youth, far above all outward Ornaments, and eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> above learning it self; for a Common-wealth hath much more need of honest, then wise Citizens, and one good man is worth a Myriade of great wits.</P>
<P>Fourthly, We should endeavour to season Youth with Ingenuity, and stir up the seeds of emulation, that they may no longer act like prest Souldiers, but Vo|lunteers. That duty may be their de|light, and knowledge the subject of their pride; incentives far more power|ful, than terrour or restraint; for what can probably be expected from those that go to school, as if they went to Bridewell, and at best, love book<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no
<PB N="60" REF="36">
better then a Turn-spit doth his Wheel?</P>
<P>Fiftly, There should be a <HI>North-west</HI> pas|sage found, for the attaining of the La|tine Tongue, that we need not use such a tedious ambages, as is, in effect, more barbarous, then the tying of the Horses tail to the Plough; nor instead of a journey, which might be dispatched in few dayes, wander, like the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> forty years in the Wilderness. For in learning Language, which yet is but the gate or avenue of art &amp; knowledg, we not only lavish our time, but waste that stock of industry, which nature indued us with, for higher and nobler designes; so as being harrassed with this drudge|ry, we have little vigour left us to at|tempt Philosophy or humane Learning. And let no man object, that our early years are not capable of such improve|ments. For why should we doubt, but that Mathematicks, History, and even mo|rality, in some degree, may be insinuated to us very young, since Children are so soon put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> make use of Invention, their strong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and which, indeed, as
<PB N="61" REF="36">
yet is but too slender and barren? Half that time and diligence which they trifle away in Epistles and Themes, (ex|ercises, miserably patched up of childish matter, and stollen phrases) would yield another manner of fruit, if it were im|ployed in translating to and fro, the best moral Authours, whereby not one|ly the Language would soon grow fa|miliar, but the stile would imprint it self, and perhaps, the spirit and Idea re|main with them. Neither do I see, why they should converse so much with the poets at that Age, when they read them, with so much difficulty, and so little re|lish, unless there be a design, in perplex|ing the Scholar, to amuse his Parents. and lengthen the employment. As for <HI>Greek,</HI> though it seemes to be in some proportion necessary to the perfection of the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue, yet I am sure, to ma|ny that learn it, it is of little use, espe|cially being taught as it is, by halves, as if it were learned on purpose to be for|gotten. Certainly, were the Rules of the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue discreetly abridged, and no other Language spoken in publick

<P>Sixthly, The learned and able Pro|fessors of Arts and Sciences, should en|devour to render them more clear and Mathematical, by vindicating them from many of those uncertainties and intrica|cies wherewith they are now entangled, that our knowledge be no longer buil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon such Hypotheses, as are more easily admitted, then consented to or proved; so that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny of our found<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions being blown away with one blast of denial, we are as far to seek, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s if we had n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver stu|di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, And being once beaten from <HI>A|ristotle,</HI> stand as mute, as an ignorant Ca|tholick would do, if he could be driven from his impregnable Citadel the Church.

<P>I rather incline to their Stoical opini|on, who believe, that notwithstanding those goodly glosses and appearances, which fond Custom hath put upon this method of breeding, yet the goodness of the fruit scarce answers the fairness of its blossoms, but that, on the contrary, it is the Sep-mother of Learning, the Im|posture of Vertue, and a vast prodigality of Time; for it is observable of many novices, when they travel, that at best they do but spend their curiosity, in ga|zing upon sensible Objects, Towns, Pa|laces, Bridges, and the like, as if they were only sent for silly spies, to view the situation of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ountry.</P>
<P>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t since the prejudice of times in this behalf is such, that to disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te a|gainst it, is in danger to be accounted, rather Heresie then good Philosophy, I will endeavour to offer some prepara|tives by way of caution, that Youth may travel with more benefit, or lesse mis|chief.</P>
<P>Let then the grounds of true Religion
<PB N="68" REF="40">
be first imprinted in early Youth, with such lively Characters, as will not easi|ly be defaced, for Travellers seldom meet with those that catechise th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m; many objects indeed they shall have to distract, and alienate, but few or none to perswade, or encourage them, in pious duties; so that if they have not a stock, to subsist in time of dear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, they may soon perish, being so remote from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nurture of Parents, and destitute of friendly admonitions, in Countri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> where a different worship being establsh|ed, they are constrained either to for|sake, their Religion, or forget their piety.</P>
<P>Let them have civil and liberal Edu|cation, to shame neither their friends, nor themselves, for else they will seem to travel, like <HI>Barbarians</HI> into <HI>Greece,</HI> not so much to learn the Arts and Orna|ments of other Countries, as to discover the Nakednesse of their own.</P>
<P>Let them be untainted with Vices, which in travelling increase like snow|balls. Above all, let them be armed with Temperance, and free from the habit of Wine-bibbing, else the novelty of deli|cious
<PB N="69" REF="40">
fruits and pleasant Wines in Sou|thern Climates, will debauch them, to the hazard of their health and wits; and for reputation, make them seem swine in the eyes of such civil and well-governed people, as those amongst whom they shall live; neither will any caution pre|serve them vertuous, where Incontinen|cy is boldly profest, and Lust is become, not a Custom only, but a Diet.</P>
<P>Let them be endued with under|standing, and natural parts, at least more th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n vulgar; for travelling is a Trade, not to be set up, nor driven, without a reasonable stock, neither do we endea|vour to enamel or polish the common Flint, but reserve our labour for Metalls and Jewels, as only worthy of such Art.</P>
<P>Let them be competently furnished with humane learning, and at least ma|triculated in Philosophy; for though travelling may perhaps build, yet cer|tainly it layes no foundations: There are methods and degrees of breeding; And no man ever at once vaulted into per|fection. The knowledge of termes, and things, must, in good order, precede the
<PB N="70" REF="41">
study of men, else it will resemble those that learn Languages, only by the eare, without Rules, who may, indeed, speak intelligibly, but scarce elegantly, and their want of Orthography shall alwayes discover their lameness.</P>
<P>Let them not be so much strangers to <HI>Story</HI> and <HI>Mapps,</HI> that when they first see <HI>France,</HI> they shall think, they discover <HI>America,</HI> and be so surpris'd with the novelty of objects, as if they saw not men but theaters, and when they changed stations, sifted scenes; for then their time will be wasted in vain amusements, and they will not have travelled, but dream't, As Children when they first come to <HI>London,</HI> are lost in the street<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, As meere Country people admire the gaudy signes before every shop, and are in <HI>France,</HI> when they see <HI>West|minster</HI> or the <HI>Exchange.</HI></P>
<P>Let them stay, till they have gotten some habit of discretion, and experi|ence in conversation; for they must know how to stand upon their Guard, and support themselves; they can relie upon no mans tenderness, to consider
<PB N="71" REF="41">
their youth, and pardon the errours of Child-hood. All their blots will be hit, all their forfeitures will be taken, since to men of prudent behaviour, it is commonly a great priviledge to be strangers, but to indiscreet persons, a greater prejudice.</P>
<P>Let them, (if possible) be perfect Lati|nists, not only for pen, but speech, for that, in travelling, is as current coine in Trade, and somewhat more necessary, in this respect, that it cannot so readily be supplied by way of Barter; The Load|stone hath made all the world, in effect, one continent, and the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue ciments, at least, all the learned world, as it were, into one Nation. Without it, Travellers are, for some time, such silly mutes, that it rests in the Companies charity, to think that they have Rea|son.</P>
<P>These are the principal cautions, which readily offer themselves unto me, and which I recommend to all young Travellers: from these they may expect much security and benefit; Yet, since we first learn to swim with Corks and
<PB N="72" REF="42">
Bladders, And it seems, too unsafe, to trust so unfixed an age, only to its own conduct, methinks a provident Fa|ther should not easily be drawn to ven|ture his Son abroad, without a discreet Tutor or Governour, who is so needful to supply the Authority of a Parent, and the familiarity and assistance of a friend, that the best that can be found, is to be purchased at any Rates; I will there|fore briefly describe, what such a Go|vernour, either is, or should be; some qualities and conditions in him are ab|solutely necessary, others very expedi|ent.</P>
<P>Necessary is sobriety of life and man|ners, to give his Pupil none, but good example, which will add vigour to all his Counsels and reproofs; Prudence, to sit like a wary Pylot at the Helm, and foresee inconveniences, before they fall; Urbanity and gentleness of speech and behaviour, to be the ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">binger of per|swasion; for counsels roughly given, are received with prejudice. And lastly, Gravity to preserve and redeem (if need be) both his Person and Office from
<PB N="73" REF="42">
contempt or neglect; very expedient is abundance of learning, especially hu|mane, that, daily insinuating the best no|tions, by way of discourse, his conver|sation may at once unite the pleasure of entertainment, with the benefit of an Academy; An Age not superannuated, nor much unequal to that of his <HI>Pupil,</HI> lest it deprive him of that diligence, or complaisance, which belongs to his Of|fice; Decent and manly behaviour, be|cause his Scholar will be apt to imitate him; To have travelled himself before, That he may instruct his Pupil from his own experience, And being skilful in Languages, supply his defects.</P>
<P>To travelling, especially so attended, belongs a plentiful and honourable al|lowance of expence, without which, we do but travel on foot, and in <HI>Quirpo.</HI> Indeed, too much expence is the Mother of idleness, vanity, and folly; But discreet plenty should be afforded to every one that pretends to travel for his advantage, that he may keep pace with Gentlemen, and men of parts, may be in an Equipage, capable of their acquaintance and civili|ties
<PB N="74" REF="43">
and not confined to <HI>Chambre Garnie,</HI> or a poor <HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sion,</HI> where he shall proba|bly converse with none, but persons ig|norant of good manners, and of all things which a Traveller should be most ambitious to know or learn; For young men are supposed to travel, not that they may save mony, but gain knowledge; If they be sent forth without competent maintenance, This is not to travel, but shift, which they would better do in their own Country, than in forein parts; where their hands are bound, and their tongues tied, having neither language nor credit to help themselves. Money is to Travellers, as Wings to Birds, they have no other friend, or passe-port, nothing else that can recommend or address them to society; for they must buy their acquiantance, almost, as they do that which they eat or wear, and by discreet prodigality, woe acceptance, since they are not welcom upon ordinary terms, And whosoever lodges a stranger, makes account he hath a booty, where|in, though the wary and prudent fru|strate their expectation, yet they cannot
<PB N="75" REF="43">
prevent their hopes, nor alter their pre|judices.</P>
<P>Thus furnished and qualified, young men may, indeed, travel the more safely, perhaps profitably; otherwise to send them abroad, at least without many of these furtherances and cautions, is to employ them upon a very hazardous, but unprofi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able adventure, and too much resembles the exposing of Infants, to be nursed, like <HI>Romulus,</HI> by Wolves and Bears.</P>

<HEAD>IX. Of Religious Fear.</HEAD>
<P>HOw little do they understand the nature of true Piety, that cannot distinguish the terrours of Sinful guilt, from the just apprehensions of a Religi|ous soul, but look upon fear, as the fatal Omen of an evil conscience&punc; which is the only symptome of spiritual life? The Chirurgion having no other proof, that
<PB N="76" REF="44">
the cure is not desperate, then quickness of sense.</P>
<P>There is a confidence, grounded upon the precipitated admission of those things for certain truths&punc; the soundness whereof we are afraid to examine: Hap|py are they, that seasonably discover the rottenness of such foundations, and ap|ply themselves to lay sure ones. There is a faith, more d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bious then the Sect of the Scepticks, It will not believe its sen|ses, nor the Demonstrations of the Ma|thematicks; Experience gives it small satisfaction, because it as much sus|pects the experiment, as the thing expe|rimented: Such an uncertainty of Me|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ums, such an Imperfection of Organs it imagines, that every Object seems to it a delusion. It s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lf least of all it trusts, knowing what an impostor dwells in its own breast: And these cautions work so powerfully, that they render it inde|fatigable in the pursute of happiness. So that this fear, (though sometimes it may seem to fight with its own shadow) is a safe and fruitful fear, recompensing the Anxieties of a moment, with eternal security.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="44">But say some&punc; We ought to rest only upon the love of God; We, that are E|lect and redeemed Fear we leave for Reprobates, who having no sense of Gods love to them, receive no impressi|ons, but those of terrour, and are like sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ves, condemned, as it were, to the Galleys of Fear. An Argument, cer|tainly full of sweetness, If it did not tend wholly to undermine duty, and re|duce the Power of Religion into Airy Speculation; If it did not teach men to be so unmannerly at their Devotions, that their Prayers prove commonly but contempts: should the Heathen, (who profoundly adore the workmanship of their own hands,) see their Irreverence, They would with some colour be apt to confirm themselves in their Idolatrous surmise, That it is better to have visible, than invisible Deities.</P>
<P>Fear is as a bridle to the Conscience; That soul which hath no fear, is like a Ship, that carries all it sayles, but hath no ballasts, If it could escape over-setting in the Sea, yet it is sure to split upon the Rocks: We do not more need the zeal
<PB N="78" REF="45">
of generous Love, then the caution of well advised Fear.</P>
<P>I acknowledge those Acts of Piety to be the most excellent, that proceed pure|ly from the Ingenuity of love; But these are certainly the least for number, The greatest are such, as derive themselves from a principle, mixt of necessity and choice. Love indeed makes the purest Holocausts, yet are not the Sacrifices of innocent fear to be undervalued; I am perswaded, Fear hath resisted, as many, and as strong temptations, as Love.</P>
<P>But who is so Chymical&punc; that he can extract, who so Metaphysical, that he can abstract love from fear? Fear is as the Lees of Love, which it can never work out in this life, nor will it ever be pur|ged of those Crudities, till it ferment in|to perfect Charity. Love is no bondage indeed, but a non-age it is, and a filiati|on, which for the present, differs little from the condition of a Servant.</P>
<P>A lively Emblem of this truth, we shall find in friendship; What a Critick is it of words? What a searcher into thoughts? what a spie upon our actions,
<PB N="79" REF="45">
and manners? How doth every omission beget a kind of guilt? How are true friends more sensible and fearful of un|kindness then wounds, of giving then receiving? And this is the Estate of all Vertuous or real Amity; A relation, not|withstanding, which <HI>prim&acirc; facie,</HI> seems to consist wholly in Confidence.</P>
<P>A yet neerer, and more sublime Idea of our Love to God, is natural Consci|ence, That, by whose light and aid, Phi|losophers atchieved such Miracles of Vertue and self-conquest. What a Curb was this in the mouths of good Heathens? What a restraint, far beyond any sense of Honour, or fear of punish|ment? How did it suppress the passions, and smother the thoughts, that they durst not so much as dream extravagant|ly? And yet what society to good men, so sweet as solitude? He that is not clear in his own sight, where should he esta|blish his Confidence, where shall he con|tract a firm league? Howbeit this is cer|tain, that true Philosophy enjoynes every man, to be his own <HI>AEacus &amp; Minos.</HI></P>
<P>But that it may yet further appear,
<PB N="80" REF="46">
how love and fear are mixed and inter|woven, Every dayes experience pro|claims it; For whence comes the Misers love of his money, but from fear of po|verty? wherein consists the Enjoyment of health, but in security from sickness? And how could miserable life be so precious, even to unfortunate men, If they did not rather fear the approach of death, then love or relish those dregs of their lives?</P>
<P>Now therefore, since God is greater than our Consciences, more intimate than any friend, more precious than life, What an awe must we have of his pre|sence, what a horrour of his absence? What prostration to him can be ac|counted superstition? what Zeal, Will-worship? what ambition can we enter|tain, but that of humility? what emula|tion, but that of reverence? who can be morigerous enough in his duty, who cir|cumspect enough in his behaviour, what repentance is sufficient to pacifie, what prayers to intreat, what addresses to adore him?</P>
<P>What signifie those precepts of awe
<PB N="81" REF="46">
an reverence, so frequently repeated, as well in the Gospel, as under the Law? The numerous Catalogues of such, as with speedy vengeance have paid the forfeiture both of Impiety and sawcy De|votion? Those Characters of his wrath, with so much terrour recorded, unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the notions of a jealous God, a consu|ming fire? What meant that transcen|dent Devotion of primitive Christians, which some (I presume, that they may not be obliged to imitate it) scarce commend? Their watchings and fast|ings? their self-revenge and violence done even to nature? What do they all teach us? but this, That God will be served with industrious fear, and not with lazy love?</P>
<P>But, if any yet seem to doubt, let him reflect upon himself, How he hath com|plied, not with the rigour of the Law, but the latitude of the Gospel; What he hath deserved at the hands of God, and what will certainly befall him, with|out an Ocean of mercy, He shall then find far greater ground of distrust, then of confidence, If not, yet let him not ac|quiesce
<PB N="82" REF="47">
in an insufficient triall, but rather suspect his experience, then deny so great a truth.</P>

<HEAD>X. Of Church-Discipline.</HEAD>
<P>HE that compares the present Max|ims of some blind Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lots, with the wisdom and moderation of ancient Lawes, will find it a strange Method, to root out Superstition by decrying Devo|tion, To prevent Heresie, by introducing an instability of Truths, and a bijearrery of Religions, to meet with will-wor|ship, in the Abolition of all Duty, and to batter <HI>Babylon</HI> by erecting <HI>Babel.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly, our Age is not so regular, that it needs no restraint, Our manners are not so exact, that they will admit no censures, Our piety hath not so high a Calenture, that it had need lose so much blood: God preserve our Religi|on from a Lethargy, and a Consumpti|on,
<PB N="83" REF="47">
we shall deal well enough with the Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urisie.</P>
<P>Religion is like a curious Watch, soon out of frame, And Discipline is as the case that preserves it; Religion is like the Apple of the eye, tender and ob|noxious to every dust, And Discipline is as the eye-lid that shelters it.</P>
<P>I see not, why any should hate Disci|pline, but such as resolve to abuse their liberty; There is no enemy to Lawes, but the lawless, and such as think they have more interest in their punishments, than their protections, or hope, that in a general medley and Chaos of disorder, their evil manners will passe unre|proved, nay uncontroled, For what re|straint is left for those sins, which stand in awe, neither of justice nor shame?</P>
<P>Not of Justice, For how wickedly do many live, even to the reproach of that holy faith which they profess, and yet either satisfie, or delude the Law? How many sorts of Impieties are there, where|by Conscience is wasted? As legal, or subtle oppressions, secret malice, neg|lect of all good Duties, and even Aposta|cy

it self, which yet de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie publick Ju|stice, and can certainly fear nothing, but a Court of Admonition to reprove, and brand their Enormities. Justice cannot take hold of them, without such extreme rigours, as will in its execution expose it to Arbitrary Power, and make it rather a snare to Innocency, then re|straints of mischief. Not of shame, For in a general disorder, none is censured, And whilst every one is scandalous, no man is scandalized.</P>
<P>The sarcedotal, and Apostolical Offi|ces indeed, are ceased, But the Evangeli|call function still survives, Nor are those ordinary jurisdictions lost, which the A|postles held, not as Apostles, but Bishops, whereof none ever seemed to have so much need, as this latter and perillous Age, which is prophetically entituled to such a Catalogue of enormous sins, as the simplicity of primitive times was scarcely acquainted with: We are in|deed to expect no miracles, But shall vve submit to no Government? because vve cannot have <HI>Moses,</HI> shall vve admit of no Magistrates?</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="48">Long lay the primitive Christians un|der the grievous yoak of Heathenish Ty|ranny, enjoying neither toleration, nor connivence; They had then no Lawes, but of their own admission, No Governours, but of their own permission; They lived rather by Examples then Lawes: It was then but necessary, there should be ex|traordinary, to supply the defect of or|dinary powers; Now that Christians are our Magistrates, It may justly be ex|pected, that what was planted by Mira|cles, should be cherished by Lawes: But no persecuted Church can be in so de|plorable a condition, as that which wants Apostles, and rejects Pastors.</P>
<P>The Church is not so limited to forms and methods, but that she hath still a latitude left her to act according to her Emergent necessities, and frame to her self such constitutions, as self-preser|vation requires, and the example of all societies will justifie; I cannot see, why civil property should be secured and em|paled with the best Lawes, that wisdom and experience can devise, And yet Christs Vineyard should be left without a hedge, The Army of Martyrs like dis|banded
<PB N="86" REF="49">
Troops, and Christians like a multitude of people, that hath entred into no society.</P>
<P>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t perhaps the Magistrate is jealous of his Soveraignty, And fears, lest the spiritual jurisdiction should reign in mens hearts, to the supplanting of secu|lar O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">edience; I confess, this fear is not wholly void of colour, yet is it not a just fear; For Church-Discipline is in it self so innocent and passive, that it seems too wise a Providence, wholly to de|prive the Church of spiritual Arms, lest she should usurp temporall.</P>
<P>Truly, as the Civil Sword protects the Church, so again, the Church being armed with convenient Discipline, may add much force and vigour to the Civil Powers, and even protect its own Pro|tector; By planting in mens hearts the awe of Religion, which is the main pil|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of obedience; By advancing Vertue in those free habits which exceed meer D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ties, and prevent Justice with chari|ty; By weeding out such errours, as hu|mane Authority would have much adoe to pluck up, And checking those vices
<PB N="87" REF="49">
in their source, the course of whose tor|rent, Lawes are not able to oppose.</P>
<P>We admit indeed of a moderate sway, in matters purely Ecclesiastical, But we do not embrace their violent Coertions, that would seem to engrose all truth, and make it Heresie to doubt, where they define; That would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain save Christ his pains in propagating or defending the Gospel. The true Church deals with shame, not with Tortures, with Cen|sures, not with Gibbets; The largest Power she pretends, is to sequester from her Communion; Now, if Schismaticks will allow themselves the Power of separating, when they please, why should they repine, if she banish from her society&punc; such as even judge themselves unworthy of it?

<HEAD>XII. Of Duties Matrimonial, and Conjugall Love.</HEAD>
<P>HAving briefly treated of single Life, It remains now to take a survey of Conjugall. The first concerns few, and those esteemed but a kind of Anchorites, and looked upon as the Schismaticks of humane Society; The second is of a ge|neral extent, And whatsoever is said upon that subject, seems to touch Man|kind: Give me leave therefore to offer somewhat by way of Essay only (with|out Argument or reproof) in relation to Duties, so vast and publick as those of Matrimony; And let not any marvail, That being neither in Act, nor Contem|plation, as yet a Husband, I am so busie to thrust my self into the Charge, and instruct the maried; For I conceive, That as a third Party, uninteressed, I were the fitter, if need required, to interpose; However, since I undertake to state no
<PB N="93" REF="52">
Controversies, but deliver Truths, gene|rally received, and favourable alike to both sides, My forwardnesse in this kind, if it deserve no commendation, can pro|cure no just offence.</P>
<P>The Duties then betwixt man and wife are considered, as common to both, or peculiar and proper to either: common to both, And so they owe re|ciprocally, each to the other;</P>
<P N="1">1 To make their Union an Act of prudent choice, not of chance, fondness, or meer Avarice; For it is no wonder that should miscarry, which was mis|conceived, Or that bitterness should be in the event, where folly was in the De|sign.</P>
<P N="2">2 Communication of Vertuous know|ledge, and spiritual Commerce. We cannot but desire to promote the happi|ness of those we love, And that Passion should be so much the more fervent, by how much its end is more excellent; wherefore such as delight in each o|thers well-fare here on earth, cannot but far more earnestly covet to meet in Heaven.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="95" REF="53">3 Mutual Fidelity; For falshood of af|fection, dissolves the Bond of Matrimo|ny, And those that transgress the li|mits of lawful love, are already, before God, in a State of nullity; We may say of them, like St. <HI>Paul,</HI> upon another ac|count, They have apostated from the faith, and are worse then Infidels.</P>
<P N="4">4 Quiet Conversation and compli|anc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, without publick jarrs, or secret grudges; If any discords happen, yet they ought to be little &amp; short, that by a sweet &amp; ingenuous return of friendship, they may rather quicken, then discom|pose the Harmony&punc;</P>
<P N="5">5 Communion and Constancy, in good and evil Fortunes; To joy and sorrow, thrive and wither, live and die together, since they are involved in each others sufferings, and have espoused, not persons only, but Conditions, even Af|flictions and Infirmities.</P>
<P N="6">6 An intire affection to, and care of their common issue, whereby Conjugall love is increased and intended, like re|flected heat; Indeed, what greater re-en|forcement of affectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> can there be? since
<PB N="94" REF="53">
faithfull friends despair in any thing so lively to express or testifie their love and respect to deceased Parents, as in the en|dearment of their surviving Chil|dren.</P>
<P>Peculiar Duties are either of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Man to his Wife, or the Woman to her Hus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">band: The Husband owes his Wife.</P>
<P N="1">1 By his freedom and Complaisance in her society, as much, as in him lies, to gratifie her just and kind expectati|ons, improve the comforts of her life, and sweeten her solitudes, lest she have cause to think her self in the condition of a Widow, even whilst she is maried; For since, whilst she was free, and might have refused, her love to his Person, bribed or swayed her, to submit to his yoak, He were very ungrateful to neglect her that chose him; If elective Princes oppress, they have no excuse, since they violate not only the Rights, but even the good will of their Electours.</P>
<P N="2">2 Tend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rness to her errours, and a kind of equal jurisdiction, not assuming the Authority of a censoriou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Paeda|gogue, not p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tting her to the wrack of

observancy, not expecting so much re|gard, as discreet VVives, of their own accord allow.</P>
<P N="3">3 Confidence in her Vertue, and ho|nest freedom in her Actions and beha|viour; For jealousie is like a perpetuall alarm, Herein most unjust, That it bind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> its Criminal to prove the Negative, And arraigns her for a Crime, whereof, being once charged, she can never purge her self.</P>
<P N="4">4 Communication of Counsels and secrets, so far at least, as will consist with Justice to others, and by his own Pru|dence; For he that locks up his bosom from his Wife, especially in matters of Common Interest, questions her fidelity, or, at best, condemns her discretion.</P>
<P N="5">5 An Equal use of temporal Blessings; Indeed a Wife is not like a Steward, or Receiver, Neither ought any Action of Accompt to lie against her, who sharing with her Husband in Wealth and Pover|ty, may not be presumed prodigal of her own Interest, and improvident for her Children.</P>
<P N="6">6 A sober and careful Managery of

his Estate, without sinful imbezelling, or sloathful impayring that Weal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, which is but half his own; For what delight can there be in a declining fortune? What feeming fondness can repair suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a reall injury? The VVife may well pit|ty or indulge, but cannot truly affect a Husband, from whose Luxury, she ap|prehends, or feels her own ruine; let him pretend what love he will, if she do no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> distrust, she hath too much cause to dis|dain it.

<P N="2">2 Singular Modesty, and simplicity of behaviour, as the necessary Hand|maid of honour: For though, unchastity be the fouler sin, against God and her self, Yet the scandall of Impudence i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> far the greater wrong to her Husband.</P>

<P N="4">4 If not a Confidence in his Prudence, Yet in most cases a submission to his Judgement, not disputing his Authori|ty, nor f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rcing him to assert it; For such Controversies are ever unseasonably moved, The power of Wives consisting in the generous love of their Husbands, who, if they be not barbarous, will even strain Compliance with them, And pre|venting their reasonable desires, will of their own Accord, know, That to insult

<P N="5">5 Discretion, if need be, to keep se|crets; That by her Imbecillity, she force not her Husband, to the unhappy choyce of unkind reservedness, or indiscreet confidence, of standing in her behalf up|on his Guard, or betraying his own af|fairs and prudence.</P>
<P>And lastly, Frugality; whereby her Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">band shall finde, that to trust her li|berally, is his best and most honourable thrift, And being encouraged by her approved Mesnage, securely refer his do|mestick Affaires to her Charge and Go|vernment.</P>

<P>Yet so sensual a Quality is Pride, that it had rather be smoothered in a Feather-B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, then accept of hard Lodging, which would hurt its tender Limbs; It refus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s nothing that is pleasant, But the bitte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Potion will not down, The Pa|late disgusts it, the Stomack loaths it, and the Belly fears griping; Indeed, the manners of great Men are commonly so proud and ulcerate, that they will not endure the Probe, Their actions are like that virulent scab, which they call the <HI>Noli me tangere.</HI></P>
<P>Truth agrees with none but the Inno|cent, And Reproof complies only with those, whose lives, (if they be not bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">meless) yet are not ripe and rank with scandall: They fear not the Cen|sures of others, that are <HI>Catoes</HI> to them|selves,

<P>I Am not ravished with natural Ver|milion, so easily counterfeited by Art, or imitated by Artists; Yet neither am I so severe a Stoick, as wholly to con|temn it, Methinks, as our unadvised Philosophers, labouring, with their profound exorcismes, to cast out the fear of death, rather than augment its terrors; so some men, by decrying beauty, with pedantick gravity, enhance its Reputa|tion, or increase their appetites, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ick palats are apt to long for M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh|rooms, and other meats, forbidden them by the Physician.</P>

<P>Truly, I am astonished, and much scandalized at that solemn, yet silly pa|geantry, which they call the courting of

<P><PB N="109" REF="60">The discourse of beauty points perpen|dicularly at Women, who have so en|grossed its perfection, that they brook not to hear of any Rival, except the An|gels; so as to sleight beauty, is in effect to slight Women, who being wholly ex|cused, and partly excluded from heroick Actions, yet triumph in their passive Ex|cellencies, whereby, if they do not equal, yet they parallel the brave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t men; In passive excellencies, indeed, yet not meerly passive; For what Trophies are more memorable than Beauties?</P>
<P>Certainly, It was not given them in vain; It is the Royal stamp and im|pression, for which, at least, they are va|lued, as excellent Medalls; with this badge of their order, as with a religious habit, they travel every where, like se|cure Pilgrims, And Violence offered them, is like breach of the Law of Nations; Nay, it not only preserves them from injuries and neglects, but re|commends them to all the advantages and prerogatives of life; And therefore wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h much reason, they are of nothing so impatient, as that their beauty

<P>CRaft is a kind of honourable kna|very, Or the art of halting be|twixt honesty and wisdom, to each of which, it highly pretends, but is in both, equally lame and defective; For it hath nothing stable or solid, It stands upon no Basis, It owns no Principles, all its motions are excentrick, and it is but a trick of shifting and living <HI>extem|pore,</HI> like those that are put to seek their fortunes.</P>
<P>True Prudence, whose practice is re|gular, and whose end is Vertue, is scarce to be found; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d therefore this Court|ly imposture cannot but passe current, in so corrupt an age as ours, when the highest aim of mens actions is to save their Credits, and their best Religion, to sin demurely; When no man thinks

himself guilty, till he be apprehended, Nor imagines any offence, but where he must do penance. Who is he, that dares call the crafty man knave? None I pre|sume, but himself; Others indeed may shrewdly suspect, But it is no lesse cha|rity to believe, then prudence to speak warily, They are, I hope, no Recusants that go to Church, no Bastards, that were born in Mariage.</P>
<P>But alas, This is as a secret Vermine, knawing the very root of Honesty, And is such Leven in all our actions, as turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the sweetest milk, into the soureness of a Rennet, It poysons vertue at the spring head, by infusing that <HI>Italian</HI> Maxim, That all Heroick habits have their birth from D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sign, and their nourishment from Ambition.</P>
<P>This is the disguise, that renders those Actions plausible, which if naked and uncouched, would not be patdonable, This is the dresse, which favours defor|mity, and the boot which hides the crookedness of the Leg; For whilst Hypocrisie p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lliates sin, Craft shelter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hypocrisie, which would otherwise be

more obnoxious, then sin it self, since wicked men live as cowardly, as the wild <HI>Irish</HI> are said to make warre, And would every day be cut in pieces, if they had not the retreat of a Bogge.</P>
<P>This is that Mock-Authority, which gives a counterfeit passe-port to all our Vices, And affords a safety to guilt, be|yond the security of the innocent; which by its false marches, and continual tra|verses, leads the Lawes a Dance, and e|ven harasses the Magistrate, with the frequency of its Alarms, The only good it hath, is this, That it proclaims the ne|cessity of a Resurrection, when simplicity shall triumph over Craft.</P>
<P>Truly, Nothing doth so fatally evi|dence the declining of our Manners, as to see Craft in such Reputation, be|ing exalted with all the Panegyricks due to wisdom; As if we were to be train|ed up to Vertue, like the <HI>Lacedaemonian</HI> Children to the Warres, In whom the dexterity of Stealing, and impudence of Lying were held presages of heroick Spi|rits; Craft, which dares not look o|thers, nor its own Conscience, in the

<HEAD>XVI. Of Kindness, Courtesie, and Civility.</HEAD>
<P>IT is strange to observe, How these three Ornaments of Conversation, (which indeed, have some common li|neaments of resemblance, though no per|fect likeness) are in vulgar speech, (the bane of propriety) wont to be confoun|ded; But it is yet stranger to consider, how they are apt (at least some of them) to passe for that Angelical habit of friendship, Amongst themselves, they are easily distinguished, Betwixt them and it, there is no proportion.</P>
<P>Amongst themselves, Criticisme will shew us, That they differ in their Ge|nus and Properties; For kindness must be referred to <HI>Indoles,</HI> Courtesie to <HI>Facul|tas,</HI> Civility to <HI>Aptitudo,</HI> The first, <HI>Inna|ta,</HI> the second <HI>Induta,</HI> the third <HI>Imbuta,</HI> In their Objects, For the proper Object<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of kindness, are our natural relations

<P>However, In our dregs of times, which have, in effect, left us onely the name and husk of Friendship, these are esteemed great Amities, And are, I fear, the best we have; Indeed, we could, by no means want them, for they serve turn in default of better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lment, to patch up a kind of Society, and entertain Commerce.</P>

<P>Courtesie is a faculty of great advan|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, And a Commodity of as nimble Vent, as any in the shop; It bespeaks Acceptance, it bribes Good will, and prevails, beyond Importunity.

<P>It is, indeed, that recollected Estate of true Wisdom, wherein commonly we begin to live, and from whence we may

reasonably date the time of our being, as <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth was wont to reckon his Age, onely from the day of his Retreat. It is a seasonable interval of perfect lei|sure, wherein the soul, being no longer biassed &amp; diverted with present amuse|ments, seriously reflects upon things Past, and diligently prepares her self for things to come; Till then, she was wholly laid aside, the Body kept her, as it were un|der hatches, and she lived, but like slen|der Coals raked up in vast Embers.

We now decline those Airy speculations, which are, in|deed, but the Itch of the Mind, And pa|ring off the Excrescencies of unfruitful knowledge, reduce all our Theory into

Practice. What further can be added to the just merits of Old Age, whose Actions are Uniform, and its Passions re|gular, whose Vertues are perfect, and, e|ven its errors secure.

<HEAD>XVIII. Of Honour.</HEAD>
<P>IF we might fancy a Generation of Angels, who in propagating would lose nothing of their Primitive Excel|lency, but continue their Purity in their race, It were, indeed, no Vanity, to be proud of such a Pedigree: But, since men entaile onely their Lands, and not their Vertues, Since the children of He|roes, degenerate, like Southern fruits transplanted into colder climates, Since (as if the world decayed) Gyants beget Dwarfs, I see not why <HI>Tantalus</HI> should any longer vaunt himself the son of <HI>Iu|piter.</HI></P>

is Muddy, the very fountain is brackish; to assign reward and dignity onely to merit, is indeed the proper sub|ject of a declamation, but it speaks ra|ther <HI>Vtopian</HI> then good <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Some rise by undermining the inno|cency, and betraying the confidence of others, for the great are ever heaving, like Moales: some arrive at Honors by ser|ving the Pride and other irregular Pas|sions of the Great, Or (which is much like) by loathsome flattery, For flattery is Prides Prostitute. And some are as meer Creatures of favour, as Flies of Sunshine, The very Cubbs of fortune, as blind as their damme; For Soveraigns delight sometimes to coyn such men for Medals, as have no stampe of merit in themselves.</P>
<P>The most General, most sure, and per|haps most innocent means of invading honor, is by sluggish purchase, and the infinite desert of mony; No dignity Se|cular or Sacred is ashamed to stoop to it; It creates Cardinals at <HI>Rome,</HI> it dubbs Knights at <HI>Malta,</HI> Nay it admits even Senators at <HI>Venice</HI>; Of such honors we
<PB N="126" REF="69">
may say, as some Gentlemen of their Perriwigs, or Ladies of their Complexi|ons, They are, indeed, their own, since they Paid for them.</P>
<P>How few are they, that purchase Ho|nour by desert? And if any will en|deavor it, They must cut their way through the Rock, they must past the Pikes of Malice; For the sons of fa|vour prove indeed the Envy of many, But those of merit are an eye-soar to all.</P>
<P>Wisely indeed, and Morally did the Sage Heathens decree, That the Passage to the Temple of Honour, should be thorough that of Vertue; But this was onely a Philosophy Lecture, and a kind of Hieroglyphick.</P>

<HEAD>XIX. Of Learning.</HEAD>
<P>VVHen I consider, how true Learn|ing improves every faculty of the Soul, how it refines the Understand|ing, and reforms the Mind; In fine, how it makes almost as vast a difference betwixt men and men, as betwixt Men and Animals&punc; and yet withall Observe, what slender homage is performed to the Gown, And what silly advantages most men reap from their Studies; mine ears cannot but tingle at that unhappy, yet true Proverb: Physicians get the wealth, and Lawyers the Honor, whilst Philoso|phy walkes in <HI>Quirpo.</HI></P>
<P>Surely, It was otherwise of Old; When seven Cities bandied for the ho|nor of <HI>Homers</HI> nativity, When the Wis|dom of <HI>Socrates</HI> was attested by Oracle, When Philosophers were Princes Peers, at least their Co-adjutors and Suffra|gans,
<PB N="128" REF="70">
substituted, like great Clerks, to supply the non-residence of Cardinals; When the Consulship of <HI>Rome</HI> was the daily Guerdon of Eloquence.</P>
<P>But, indeed, the Cause of this diffe|rence is too apparent, such only were then accounted Learned, as lived more learn|edly then they spake or dictated; And those were thought illiterate, though never so prompt and subtle, whose halt|ing Practices betrayed the lameness of their Minds; Sophistry was not yet in Credit, nor any of those Superficial Arts, which prove abortive of Wisdom, and fruitful onely of Ostentation; There were not many that had Confidence to usurp a title so envious as Philosophy, such as then wore the Venerable Gown, having purchased fame by degrees and Methods, and so attaind to Maturity, needed no other Characters of Honor, then those that were written in their foreheads.</P>
<P>Whereas the Learned of our Age are so far from challenging reverence or true applause, that they even fall into contempt, and are become the onely
<PB N="129" REF="70">
persons in Comoedies; They may well pretend to Learning, but their behavi|our proclaims them strangers to liberal Science; Though their tougues speak Greek, yet their manners savour of the Barbarian.</P>
<P>Much, I confess, they peruse, but in|deed read little; Variety of imperfect Notions rendring their Judgement a meer <HI>Chaos,</HI> and their Memories no bet|ter then a kind of Alphabetical Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x; You would imagine them to have dwelt rather in Caves then Colleges or Cities, For the Commonwealth hath not more unprofitable Members then th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y.</P>
<P>And yet, methinks, I could afford to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cant, or at least qualifie my invectives; Certain it is, That no Age hath more a|bounded with learned men, then the Present, which by Gourmandizing books, is now Crop-sick of knowledge; Those Arts and Sciences, which were almost like <HI>terra incognita</HI> to our Ancestors, have been in latter times, exactly sur|veyed, and are described, as it were, in Vulgar Mappes; Those Notions which were then locked up, like Jewels in a few

Truly, when I consider the throng of those, that entitle themselves to Conscience, even such, as have scarce any colour of Con|quest or alliance to it, I should greatly marvail, if I did not withall remember, how easie and natural it is to claim, where there is scarce any true property, And how fit sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is to be every mans Pro|stitute, that is no mans Spouse.</P>

But who can away with Cynical Piety, with the crabbed Doctrines of Self-de|nyal, with such a Law, as enterferes with all that is dearest to us, and is as crosse to our projects and interests, as if our enemies had invented it to countermine us?</P>

<P>And this Argument, <HI>ab incommodo,</HI> hath the greater force, in regard, nothing is more familiar, then for men of Noble Blood, eminent abilities, active spirit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and aspiring thoughts, to endeavour somewhat worthy of themselves, wherein they could not have failed, if they had not, by their own or Ancestors impro|vidence, been as it were dismounted; For when they offer to soare, they find, that though they have the courage of an Eagle, yet their wings are but like the wings of a Batt; Which misfortune is most observable in Princes, whose Ex-chequers being once emptied by profuse Gifts, and vain Pomp, not only their lawrels, but their Coronets, and even their Olive-branches wither, their Au|thority is ham-strung, and of Princes, they soon become Pensioners.</P>
<P>But let us withall consider, That the Riotous are no better than Vermine,

born to consume and devour, Drones, which making no Hony themselves, eat up that which the industry of the Bees hath gathered; For though some will object, that vast expence serves to quick|en commerce, and with some equality distribute wealth; Yet it were too bold a Paradox to maintain, That the Com|mon-wealth hath need of Vice to sup|port it.</P>
<P>Let us remember, that for a man to sacrifice his Estate to his present Appe|tite, savours of the meer Epicure, and is a more then brutish improvidence, That it hath lesse excuse, then the prophaness of <HI>Esau,</HI> which would plead extremity of hunger; Indeed, how can he be thought to contemplate eternity, that neglects posterity, and looks not beyond an instant of time?</P>
<P>Certainly, There is much Philoso|phy, nay Divinity in true thrift; It is the equiballance of the soul betwixt Lust and Avarice; For thrift is not only con|sistent with, but neer of kin to Liberali|ty, preserving it both from vice and mis|fortune; since it is seldom seen, That

I easily answer, it was not the dissolute spend, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ift, who can enjoy nothing but what he con|sumes; It was not the penurious nig|gard, who would, if it were possible, carry his Coffers with him into another VVorld; It was the honest <HI>Mesnager,</HI> whom God had blest with largeness of heart, capable of pious and generous de|signes, with abundance of wisdom, to contrive, with amplitude of fortune, to accomplish the same.</P>
<P>The vertue of Frugality dwells not in the hand, but in the mind; Else we must ascribe much Vertue to our Iron Chests; <HI>Parsimony</HI> therefore is a foul imposture; For though it want not its pretence, The exorbitancies and mischiefs of Luxury

<HEAD>XXIII. Of Active, and Passive Valour.</HEAD>
<P>THough Patience be, in our Age, ac|counted a Vertue, fon none but Eunuchs, Women, and Stoicks, Yet he that compares it with that vulgar valour, which the world so highly extolls, shall find it far more estimable, more eligible: Valour may be the heavier Iron, but Patience is the truer Steel&punc;</P>
<P>Indeed the Valour of our times seems to be the most irregular of all the Ver|tues, subject to much Intemperance, and Transportation, Very apt to degenerate into Rashness and Insolency. Patience
<PB N="141" REF="78">
is a Quality composed of Religion and Reason, Free from the Neighbourhood of Vice.</P>
<P>Valour resembles the leaves and blos|soms of the Tree, most agreeable, indeed to the fight, but flourishing only in Sum|mer; Patience is like the root or sap, which though secret, and concealed to the eye, yet keeps it alive in Winter, and preserves it from the injuries of Winds and Blasts.</P>
<P>Valour is so much seated in the Liver and Veins, Tha sometimes it appears to have more of Complexion then Vertue. Patience dwells in the upper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">egion of the soul, and hath no Commerce with the blood or humours of the body.</P>
<P>Valour is exposed to many surprisals, and is observed to have its gayeties and intermissions, It is not alwayes at hand, nor alwayes useful, For it rusts in peace. But Patience is an Armory, alwayes ready, alwayes necessary, We have not greater use of the Elements, than of it.</P>
<P>Alas! Who can fight against his de|stiny? Or what will it avail men to dare,
<PB N="142" REF="79">
when they are called to Suffer? When we come to grapple with death, or close with afflictions, more grievous than it, A dram of Patience is then worth an ounce of Valour: Valour like a stone Wall is broken with obstinate resistance, whilst Patience, like a Rampart of Mud, damps the violence by yielding.</P>
<P>Valour is a Vertue, that hath cost the World dear, Mankind is thought to have payd for it, more than it is worth; It carries, like <HI>Sylla,</HI> wrath and ruine in its countenance, And no Comet hath had so fatal an influence, upon humane affaires, Witness the subversions of Go|vernments, and Corruptions of manners, which it daily and every where effects, introducing for Justice &amp; Modesty, Ri|ot and Rapin, for the Arts and Learning of <HI>Greeks,</HI> the Ignorance and Barbarism of <HI>Gothes</HI>; These are the fruits of this tyranical Vertue, which knowes no end of booty and Conquest. Patience was never injurious to any, but as it is happy to it self, so it is alwayes innocent to o|thers, and ambitious of nothing but Martyrdom.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="79">Yet, in regard we are fallen into those latter times, when he that wants a sword, is advised to sell his Cloak, and buy one: Swords, I confess, are now become as ne|cessary as Lawes, And we can no more want Valour, than Justice, For how shall that protect others, which is not a|ble to defend it self; Justly therefore doth the World do homage to a Vertue, which is at once both terrible, and a|miable, since from it we fear our De|struction, and to it we owe our Protecti|on; It oppresses indeed, and that some|times heavily, But withall, it rescues us from all Oppressions; save its own: Truly it hath an excellent use; But then like strong Minerals, it must be cor|rected and refined from its Crudities; It must be steered by a better Pilot, For like fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and water, it is safer to serve, then command.</P>
<P>My result and Conclusion is this, I e|steem no Valour to that Christian Forti|tude, which had rather suffer the great|est injuries, then do the least; And I reckon no Coward to the Impatient man, to whom nature was cruel at his
<PB N="144" REF="80">

<HEAD>XXIV. Of Clemency.</HEAD>
<P>CLemency is a generous Vertue, en|clining Magistrates to pardon, where Lawes condemn; And herein it surpasseth Equity, as much as that doth Justice, For Equity is but moderated Law, Clemency is free grace, Equity re|lieves against rigour, Clemency remits where no Equity can relieve.</P>
<P>Now this Vertue in men, is parallel to one of the greatest Excellencies of the Divine nature, For as God, when he re|lieves our wants, exercises his Mercy, so doth he, when he forgives o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r faults, his Clemency.</P>
<P>But, Clemency, as well as Justice, is fled to Heaven, And hath scarce left her Mantle behind; Only a kind of Rag, patched up with these three sordid and
<PB N="363" REF="80">
rotten Ingredients, Fear, Policy, and Remissenesse.</P>
<P>Fear is like a secret conspirator, by whose unworthiness and treachery, Ju|stice is commonly surprised and disarm|ed, perhaps poysoned, or smoothered; And yet, when Princes have not the cou|rage to do Justice, but are sordidly over|awed by the Power, and Greatness of Offendors, This their Parasites are wont to call Clemency.</P>
<P>Policy, in this sense, is as a corrup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Judge, suborned to condemn, or a Mes|senger of Death, to strangle the Lawes unheard; And yet, whilst in order to some State-end, of more seeming advan|tage than a forfeiture, Magistrates are content to look, as it were, through their fingers, Even this Impostor must put on the shape of an Angel.</P>
<P>Remissiness is as the Lethargy of Go|vernment; Howbeit&punc; when the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igns thereof are so slack, that (contrary to the Excellent Doctrine of <HI>Stoicks, Parci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp; indulget sapiens, non ignoscit</HI>) not only criminous persons are indulged, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> even Crimes remitted, And that so sleightly &amp;
<PB N="164" REF="81">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">requently, as it seems rather a Compli|ance, than a Pardon, so that vices, as Weeds, are suffered to overtop and choak the Laws, This loosnesse also usurps the honourable name of Clemency.</P>
<P>Whereas indeed true Clemency is di|stemper'd with no alarms, aw'd with no duress, bribed with no end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, stupified with no Opium, But being a free &amp; wise habit, hath no Aim save Vertue, and is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> void of design as Bounty.</P>
<P>Certainly, the practice of this Vertue was never more necessary, than in our dayes, when Lawes are becom as dark and intricate, as the crimes and abuses they would prevent or punish, As generally penall, as if all sins were equal, And as if they were made, not with an intent that they should be duly executed, but stand, as many of them do, only for bug-bears and scare-crowes, Yet withall so nu|merous, that no memory can hope to re|tain, and indeed, scarce any innocency to satisfie them. Magistrates therefore, should by their wisdom and moderation, correct and sweeten them, especially in matter of capital concernment, wherein
<PB N="165" REF="81">
the wariness of ancient Law-givers is most imitable, who ordained the greatest punishments for none, but the greatest and most important Crime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Thereby declaring, That even whilst they design|ed to punish men as transgressors, yet still they pittied and considered them as men.</P>
<P>The errours of ignorance and impro|vidence differ from wilful and determi|nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing such as seem to be extorted by a kind of necessity, are not equal to those that proceed from malice, wan|tonness and contempt, Some faults there are, whose punishment will neither serve for example to others, nor pardon en|danger the Common-wealth; some per|sons, whose former merits, or future hopes might challenge indulgence or mitigation, In such cases Magistrate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have fair opportunities to renown their mercy and prudence, by distinguishing the circumstances and degrees of Guilt, and interposing betwixt laws &amp; offence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Lawes only examine <HI>Quid,</HI> Magi|strate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> should consider <HI>Quo animo</HI>; Lawes can admit of no excuses&punc; But Magistrates may entertain Apologies; Lawes must
<PB N="166" REF="82">
not endure that their sentences be dispu|ted, But Magistrates should listen to the equity of an appeal.</P>
<P>The wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Magistrate doth not punish men, because they have offended, but lest they should offend; He is not angry, but provident: In all his Rigours, he hath still an eye to these three ends, The a|mendment of the party, the Reformati|on of the People, and publick security. This Maxime he layes as the basis of all his Justice, That it were better many great offendors should escape, than one hon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">st Citizen suffer, Or a Member be unnecessarily lopt off from the Com|mon-wealth; And therefore it is truly said, That Nature and Reason designes good men for Magistrates.</P>
<P><HI>Seneca,</HI> with much earnestness, incul|cates this Doctrine to <HI>Nero,</HI> That against Law, none could destroy, nor any, but the Emperour, preserve, Thereby per|swading him the more to value this power of pardoning, as being the most radiant Gem of his diadem, and his best prerogative. Indeed, what glory can a Prince affect, like that of Clemency?
<PB N="167" REF="82">
since it is superiour even to Justice, A vertue truly soveraign, and incommu|nicable.</P>
<P>To some offences, an evil Conscience is sufficient punishment, Some are as slip|pery as Eeles, Lawes cannot take hold of them, Those that endeavour to re|strain them with penalties, do but soil themselves, &amp; betray their insufficiency, As that wise Emperour <HI>Tiberius</HI> obser|ved of the pomp and superfluity in his time, That Vices of that nature could be no way redrest, unless necessity reformed the poor, saciety the rich, and shame all. A good and prudent Governour will not baffle his Justice&punc; in directing his severi|ty against these and the like abuses; but will rather endeavour with the Vertue of his example to supply the defect of Edicts.</P>
<P N="3">3 But why do I vainly discourse of Clemency, whilst Equity, and even Ju|stice it self lies every where bleeding. A|las, the Lawes of most Countries are squared, rather to private Passion, then publick Benefit, to serve present designs, then procure lasting Reformations:
<PB N="168" REF="83">
Their obscurity is not by chance. It is the aim of the Law-makers, that, in in|terpreting them, they may draw to them|selves a power, as absolute, as if there were no Lawes. How then can we hope for redress, when Remedies prove Dis|eases? Or what room is there left for Clemency, whilst forfeitures are more acceptable then obedience?</P>

<HEAD>XXV. Of Magnani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity.</HEAD>
<P>IT is admirable to see, how the world hath misconceived of a brave and ge|nerous Spirit, which name is commonly attributed to none, but men of unbridled Passions, &amp; such as fortune and Education have made insolent. Now this is not pro|perly the Courage of men, but of horses, which with high keeping are apt to grow fierce and unruly.</P>

<P>He places not all his glory in his pow|er to Offend, as Boars do in their Fangs, But as he scorns the Imputation of a Coward, so he much more hates disloy|alty and Oppression, And prefers the Idea of <HI>Cato</HI> before that of <HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>He esteems Warre (as Warre, with|out due limitations,) to be a profession for none but <HI>Goths,</HI> and <HI>Vandales,</HI> a bar|barous decision of right and wrong, the last appeal, and worst of remedies to be used, like the cutting of off Gangreened lims.</P>
<P>A just Warre he persecutes, only with Relation to honest Peace, To which he Courts his Enemy, even when he hath conquered him, Alwaies ready to referre or compound his Interests, and never Ob|stinate, but in the defence of his country.</P>
<P>He is not affected with the Popular Ayr, and for discontent he never habo|red it so much as in a dream, Faction he declines, not so much for the Dang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, as the Vice and pravity of it, Reformation he intends, but listens not to Novelty;

so that turbulent Spirits despayre of his confederacy, and fear his Moderation, more then the Enmity of others.</P>
<P>He is not easily scared out of honest Principles, nor are his sober and gene|rous resolutions checked with any servile feare; For he hates that Providence, which, to the Prejudice of vertue, fore|sees all possibility of hazard, and reserves his friendship then to appear, when all others are timorous, and withdraw themselves.</P>
<P>He despises not Honour, in regard it is or ought to be the shadow of Vertue, yet weighs not himself by titles, since they adde not to his intrinsicall Value; He is rather content with the true honour of doing nothing unworthy of himself, and with the Greatnesse of a sincere heart, Thus he never seeks preferment, but it allwayes follows him, and he hath the refusall of it.</P>
<P>He is cautious, in Promising, for he is rigorous in performing, and can give no greater assurance then his word, from which to recede, might perhaps do injury to others, but to himself vio|lence.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="84">He is no Usurer of his Benefits, nei|ther by precedent delayes, nor subsequent reproaches, Full of humanity, as know|ing the Instability, and contemning the Petulancy of Fortune.</P>
<P>His memory is the faithful treasury of Benefits, or but Courtesies, received, which he ever quits seasonably, and with interest; In the mean time, he owes and owns them chearfully, and looks not up|on his Patron, as his Gaoler, detesting that ingrati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ude, which when it canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> requite, hates its benefactor.</P>
<P>As he is strict in discharging Obliga|tions, so he is nice in receiving them, es|pecially from unworthy men, lest he be driven to a kind of magnitude. For such benefits are to him, as suspected as Snares, as loathsom as Prisons, as odious as Bribes; remembering that excellent address of <HI>Seneca</HI> to <HI>Cicero,</HI> where per|swading him to disdain the mercies of <HI>Anthony,</HI> He alledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, That if his life were worth acceptance, it would not be freely offered him by so great an enemy and Tyrant.</P>

actions, and so modest in his just de|mands, that his modesty even extorts Ju|stice from others; In his censures well-advised, not only out of Prudence, but Conscience, He flie-blowes no mans same, his reports and narratives neither multiply, nor yet aggravate.</P>
<P>Prosperity he suspects, as temperate men do sweet Wine, And therefore al|layes it with sober recollection and vi|gilancy, Adversity is more his Element, He is the same to the World in both E|states, Onely to himself severer in the former, doing double duty, in regard his greatest enemies are then neerest.</P>
<P>He is large in all his actions, noble in his entertainments, laying the foundati|on of magnificence, in discreet frugality, Careless of outward things, as his pru|dence will permit, And if he be rich, he is not in bondage, nor pupillage to his Estate.</P>

he esteemes a holy Mystery, and would as soon commit sacriledge it self, as wrong it.

<P><PB N="174" REF="86">Yet, since we live not in Cloysters, but Common-wealths, since Vertues consist not in Negatives, and Wisdom is not a dumb spirit, It follows, that as Tempe|rance is better then entire abstinence, so the wisdom of speaking, only in due season, is to be preferred before demure silence. <HI>Sapiens non silet, sed tacet.</HI></P>
<P>No S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct, or Order, methinks, should be so austere, as to interdict us the bene|fit of an innocent conversation; But dis|cretion should alwayes direct our dis|courses, to some profitable end: For, a wise man will be frugal of his words, though they seem to cost him no|thing.</P>
<P>He will know, that his speech can hardly be sufficiently weighed, so as it neither ssavour of levity, nor give offence, especially in such an Age as this, wherein there may perhaps be as little safety in telling truths, as honesty in speaking falshoods, And prejudices are so many, That the veriest Sycophant findes e|nough to do to please all.</P>
<P>He will consider, That the most in|nocent Discourses, may be either igno|rantly
<PB N="175" REF="86">
misinterpreted, or voluntarily wrested, and perhaps enviously misre|ported, That it is not enough, to mean uprightly, unless he speak so warily, that even malice it self can misconstrue no|thing; for free speakers have need of Candid Auditors.</P>
<P>He will observe, How confident tal|kers betray themselves to snares and dis|coveries, Their thoughts are transpa|rent, and their brests, as it were, Chry|stall; silence hath as much advantage on them, as the close Guard in fencing, up|on an open posture, or a well-conducted Troop, upon disordered Squadrons.</P>
<P>He will seldom give way to unprofita|ble Arguments; Nor loves them, for their own sake, but truths; Knowing how much apter they are to end in ani|mosity then peace, and how subject to uncivil interferings. However, he is nei|ther peremptory, nor loud in maintain|ing them; Not peremptory, For bold assertions proclaim either invincible ig|norance, or overweening prejudice, which is ever blind of one eye; Nor loud, because he directs his speech, not to Sense, but Reason.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="87">He will remember and weigh, how great an impotency it is for a man, to fall by his tongue, How many have been accounted wise, till their own follies have confuted fame; How decently on the other side, even ignorance it self is pal|liated with silence.</P>
<P>He will be serious, even in his mirth, and wonderful choice in the subject of his Jests, so that they render him, neither faulty to himself, nor guilty to others, For unseasonable scoffes are sometimes as much resented, as solemn injuries, And friendship hath as oft been broken in jest, as in earnest.</P>
<P>In all his Discourses, he will chiefly aim at Vertue, or Peace, having an espe|ciall regard to the strict Duties of Reli|gion and Charity, And rather then transgress either of these, he will be con|tent to live and die a <HI>Carthusian.</HI></P>

<HEAD>XXVIII. Of Gratitude.</HEAD>
<P>AMongst the Characters of heroicall Vertues, I may not omit one so e|minent, as that of thankfulness, since, he that exhorts others to be thankful, pleads the Cause both of God and Man.</P>
<P>A grear Vertue, said I, nay rather a great Duty, and but a little Vertue; since eminent Vertues are such only, as seem to supererogate, Or at least enlarge themselves, beyond the narrow Chanel of not offending.</P>
<P>Yet, I cannot concur in Opinion, with those that would have Gratitude to be a limb of Commutative Justice, no more then I esteem Bounty, a species of Commerce. But this I dare not affirm, that the unthankful are but Galley-slaves to the Law, and cannot pretend to so much, as natural Conscience; for it is
<PB N="183" REF="90">
observable, That even Beasts of Prey, that have no bowels of mercy, nor sense of Justice, have yet a kind of Religion to remember benefits, Nothing is unthank|ful, but evil Angels, and wicked men.</P>
<P>An Ungrateful man is a Felon to Rea|son, which recommends to him Grati|tude, (if possible) before Religion it self, And layes it as the Corner-stone o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> naturall Divinity, which exalts <HI>Lex tali|onis,</HI> above all Lawes, and even teache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us to serve God, because he made and feeds us. Now, if we be thereby com|manded to do in Justice, as we would be done to, How much more are we di|rected to deal in Charity, as we have been dealt with? Especially since thank|fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ness hath no need of Art, nor is tied to outward advantages, But is an Act of so great simplicity, as nothing but malice it self can prevaricate.</P>
<P>Ingratitude is the worst kind of disloyalty, and breach of Confidence, For injured benefits are like Jewels, secretly deposited with friends, who, for want of witnesse, never restore them; with this

only difference, that there our honesty, here our piety is concerned.</P>
<P>Yet, let me not seem, in condemning the Vice, too much to eclipse the Ver|tue, For Gratitude is the most free and natural Issue of well-born souls, not al|lured with hopes of reward, nor extort|ed with penalties, but an invisible habit, which hath only conscience for its Jury, and God for its Judge, Parallel to Cha|rity, the Queen of Graces, whose glory it is, that she might safely have been un|charitable, Whose reward, to have ex|pected none.</P>
