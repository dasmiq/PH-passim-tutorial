<L>Fiue and twentie, iust a quarterne is ye know,</L>
<L>Euery Foole in his foolishnes wyll I show.</L>
<L>And as the prouerbe doth show very playne,</L>
<L>A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>&para; Many Fooles, the carte of sin now a dayes doth draw,</L>
<L>Nowrishyng their sinne against all right and law:</L>
<L>Though that the way to hell be very playne,</L>
<L>Yet lyke a foole I aduise th&eacute;e to returne agayne.</L>
<L>If thou in foolishnes styll doest dwell,</L>
<L>Thou shalt haue a bable and a bell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>* He is a foole that his sinnes can not hate,</L>
<L>Naught young, worse olde, such is his estate:</L>
<L>This olde foole is glad of that name,</L>
<L>Desiryng all men to take parte of the same.</L>
<L>This foole must haue in hand without fayle,</L>
<L>A bable, a bell, or els a Fox tayle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>&para; Of Fooles, yet I fynd an other sorte,</L>
<L>Which are causers of lying, and yll reporte:</L>
<L>And he is a foole both euen and morrow,</L>
<L>That nothyng wyll lend, but all thynges borrow.</L>
<L>And as the prouerbe doth show very playne</L>
<L>A hood for this foole to kepe him from the rayne.</L>
</LG>

<L>Which neuer seketh for to haue wisedome:</L>
<L>Many such fooles, wisedome disdayne,</L>
<L>Yet for their foolishnes they shall suffer payne.</L>
<L>And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,</L>

<L>A hood for this foole, to kepe him from the rayne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>

<L>In age must he sterue, or in pouertie abyde:</L>
<L>This is a foole, and of the numbe one,</L>
<L>Which in the Sommer can make no prouision.</L>
<L>And as the prouerbe doth shew very playne,</L>
