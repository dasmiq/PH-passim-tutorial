<HEAD>To the vertuous and chaste Ladie, the Ladie Edith, wife to the right worship|full Sir Rafe Horsey knight, increase of all honourable vertues.</HEAD>
<P>_PErusing (vertuous Ladie) a Greeke Author, entituled <HI>Odyssea</HI> (writ|ten by <HI>Homer</HI> prince of Greeke po|ets) noting therein, the chast life of the Ladie <HI>Penelope</HI> (in the twen|tie yeers absence of hir louing lord <HI>Vlysses</HI>) I counterfeited a dis|course, in English verses, terming it her Complaint: which treatise, comming to the view, of cer|taine my special friends, I was by them oftentimes encited to publish it. At length weying with my selfe, the shipwracke that noble vertue chastitie is subiect vnto: and seeing an vn|knowne Author, hath of late published a pamphlet called <HI>A|uisa</HI> (ouerslipping so many praiseworthy matrons, hath regi|stred the meanest: I haue presumed vnder your Ladiships pa|tronage, to commit this my <HI>Penelopes</HI> complaint (though vn|perfectly portraied) to the presse: not doubting but the Etimo|logie of so rare a subiect, enchased with the Physiognomie of your excellent chastitie: so worthie a conclusion cannot but be a sufficient argument, both to abolish <HI>Venus</HI> Idolaters, &amp; also to counteruaile the checkes of <HI>Artizans</HI> ill willers, which carpe at al, but correct nothing at al: measuring other mens labours, by their owne idle humors. Thus offering vn|to your Ladiship the firstlings of my scholers crop for a satis|faction of my presumption, and hoping you wil pardon my boldnes, and accept of this my proffered seruice, I commit you to the grace and tuition of the Almightie.</P>
