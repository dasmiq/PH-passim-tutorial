<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Sheweth the sensative part of the soule.</HEAD>
<P>THe sensative part of the soule is that which is touched with the sence, either of Joy, or grriefe.</P>
<P>This joy of the soul cannot be hin|dred by man, where it is, it is not in<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ohn 29. 22. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">sal. 73. 21.</NOTE> mans power to take it away. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 26. 22. So also, neither can all the com|forts in the world; ease a soule that is grieved, except the soul it self be touched with the sence of joy.</P>

<P>1. From the sense of the present condition of the soul, doth arise either joy or griefe; Thus:</P>
<P>The soul of man doth either rejoyce<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pet. 1. 1. 10. 26. 15.</NOTE> (in the sensative part thereof) under some present concived good; or else grieveth under some present conceived evill, &amp; that may be, when the Imagi|nation

of the soul, being fixed on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 31. 12 Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. 2. 15.</NOTE> something which it hath or want|eth, the judgement doth either like or detest it, and so accordingly, doth rejoyce or grieve in the enjoying, or want thereof. As for example.</P>
<P>A man that is Rich, imagineth<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Exam|ple.</NOTE> with himselfe what good is in Rich|es, if the judgement liketh that estate which he enjoyes? then is his soul joyful in the enjoying thereof, for the present.</P>

<P>Again, A man whose imaginations<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Exam|ple.</NOTE> are towards God, the judgement be|ing cleere, and seeing the good that is in God, the soul doth rejoyce to worship him and is grieved because of sin: but if the imaginations deceive the heart: and the judgement be cor|rupted, so that he cannot see any sweetnesse therein, then doth Gods worship become a burthen to the soule.</P>
<P>2. This joy or grief doth arise in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 32. 10.</NOTE> the soul from the sence of its future
<PB N="10" REF="9">
expectation. When the mind is set on<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 6. 19.</NOTE> something that shall befall man, the Imagination conciveth it either to be good or evill and thereupon doth ei|ther fear it, or with hope desire it, which breedeth either joy, or grie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> in the soul.</P>
<P>As when the minde is set on Jesus<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Exam|ple.</NOTE> Christ, desiring salvation through him, the Imagination conceiveth it to be good or evil, so to do and accordingly as we minde created comforts, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> ourselves on Christ as our chiefest good, so fear doth greive, or hope re|joyce our soules.</P>
<P>A man that seeketh felicity from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Exam|ple.</NOTE> creature, if the judgement conceive it to be evil, then though the heart of man be delighted therewith, yet doth not the soul desire it, but is grieved thereat, but if the Imagination con|ceive it to be good then doth the soul desire it, hope for it, and rejoyce in the thought thereof.

<P>The Iudgement being rightly in|formed we walk in peace, and serve God with comfort, but when the Iudgement is corrupted: all joy is gone.</P>
<P>The understanding being inlighte|ned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet 2. 12, 13, 14.</NOTE> we abhor sin, but when the un|derstanding is darkned, wee are be|guiled with sin.</P>
<P>The Affection being set upon a good<NOTE PLACE="marg">Collo. 3. 2, 3, 6.</NOTE> object, bringeth life; but being set on earthly things makes us in danger of the wrath of God, &amp;c.</P>
