<OPENER><SALUTE>Most honoured Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>_I</HI> Had fully designed another Discourse, <HI>viz.</HI> concerning the Nature &amp; Work of Conscience for your Ladiships Pa|tronage. But understanding of pre|parations
<PB REF="3">
by an abler judgement, on that subject, I have for some time suspended the publishing of my own conceptions. And there|fore, though at present I shall not entitle your Ladiship to my own, yet make bold to prefix your name to the labours of another, <HI>viz.</HI> This following supply to a former Catalogue of Bishops: A work that calls him Authour, whom my mother call'd father, and in which I presume your La|diship with delight will read the duly merited Commendations of that Reverend Prelate Dr. <HI>John Still,</HI> whom your Ladiships children call Great Grandfather. This Anthor stiles his acquain|tance, his Friend, his Instructer,
<PB REF="3">
his Diocesan, whom the Diocesse of <HI>Wells</HI> once knew their worthy Bishop, and the poore of the Almes-house of <HI>Wells</HI> still re|member their bountifull bene|factor. Now as this Authour in the following relations hath a|voyded the needlesse multiplying of words, and hath industriously studied a compact brevity: So I shall not widen the entrance to them by rarifying these dedica|tory lines into any large compasse, either by an importunate craving your Ladiships acceptance, that were to wrong your goodnesse, or else by any ample declaring the reasons that guided my thoughts to the publishing this tract, or entitling your Ladiship to it. Yet
<PB REF="4">
that I may somewhat satisfie the Reader, I shall give a briefe account for the one and other. And thereby let the World know, that an equitable gratitude to the dead Authors memory, and a good will that aimes at the pleasure and profit of the living hath engaged my desires to lend a hel|ping hand to midwife this dis|course, which hath layen ready for the birth above <HI>40</HI> yeers, now at last unto the publique view; It being the ingenious off-spring of his braine who was a remote instrument of my being. And in|deed the discourse it selfe is so full of profit and delight mixt together, as acquainting us with many and choice occurrences of
<PB REF="4">
former men and times, that it would have engaged the greatest stranger to greater labour. And therfore prevents a needless com|mendation from my related Pen, since it will abundantly commend it selfe to the ingenious Reader. To whom it likewise will suffi|ciently be justified even in those passages that seem most likely to offend: Since such that are inge|nious are supposed duly to con|sider,</P>
<P>The nature of the Discourse: A History, the greatest com|mendation of which is impar|tiall truth.</P>
<P>The quality of the Author: A Courtier, that writes to a
<PB REF="5">
Prince, the sonne of that King who held that Prophetick Axiom as a sure truth, and we see it fulfilled, <HI>No Bishop, No King.</HI></P>
<P>The time when, and the sub|ject of whom this Tract is.</P>
<P>So that if any should take, what is not intended, offence at the honour he gives those, that have been since lesse honoured, or at the zeal he shews against some whom he supposed their adver|saries: The Publisher desires such to consider, that in those daies when this discourse was penned, those principles which now ap peare publiquely as the Sun, and have burnt as a flame, were then
<PB REF="5">
but a small Candle newly lighted, and that carried in a dark Lant|horne, not to be seen by all, or in all places, and not at all to be seen in the Court, where the Authour lived; Which considered, the most displeased Reader, if any such be, must impute those heats to the Authors zeale, if not according to truth, yet according to his know|ledge, and the then apprehended true principles of Ecclesiasticall Policy.</P>
<P>And as for my prefixing your Ladiships name to this discourse, I shall onely adde, That as I con|ceive it not incongruous to entitle one of those Bishops grandchildren to the relation of the lives of those

<P>_WHen I consider with my selfe the hard beginning, though more prosperous successe of the reformed Church of <HI>England,</HI> me thinks it may be compa|red to a foughten battell; in which some Captaines and Souldiers, that gave the first charge, either died in the field, or came bleeding home; but such as fol|lowed, putting their enemies to flight, remained quiet and victorious. Or I may more fitly (without offence) liken that to the successe of them of the Primitive Church, wherein the Apostles and their immediatc Successors were one while honoured and magnified, by their fol|lowers
<PB N="2" REF="7">
the Christians; As St. <HI>Peter,</HI> at whose feet the believers layd down all their goods; and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who was re|ceived as an Angel of God; another while tormented, and persecuted, by <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Heathen;</HI> as the same Apostles, whip|ped by <HI>Jewes;</HI> hanged and headed by the <HI>Romans;</HI> sometimes (I say) a Centurion, a Lieutenant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Proconsull favouring them; straight a Priest, a Scribe, and a Lawyer promooting against them. A few of <HI>Caesars</HI> houshold wishing well unto them, and believing them. But the <HI>Caesars</HI> themselves for 300 yeeres (except a very few) detesting and suppressing them. For in such sort <HI>Cranmer, Ridley, La|timer, Hooper, Rogers, Coverdale,</HI> and many others enduring great conflicts in those variable times of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, King <HI>Edward,</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> suffering by fire, by imprisonment, banish|ment, losse and deprivation, with many fights, many flights and many frights for their conscience sake; those that died had the glory of valiant Souldiers, and worthy Martyrs; such as survived, have since in a long and happy peace, enjoyed the comfort of their victory, and are like still to hold the same, if some muti|nous
<PB N="3" REF="7">
souldiers of their own camp, doe not by disturbing the peace at home, give heart to the enemy abroad. Among the surveyors of these first Leaders, that past so many pikes, the first in time, and the highest in place, was Doctor <HI>Matthew Parker,</HI> (who, as by this Author is noted) having lost all his Livings for his marri|age, now being made Archbishop of <HI>Can|terbury,</HI> dissembled not his marriage, as <HI>Cranmer</HI> in King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighths time, was found to doe; which, because some have taken occasion to note with too black inke, to exclude him from the re|putation of a rubricated Martyr; and have cited the testimony of his sonnes widdow yet living, that she was carried in a trunk, and by misfortune almost stifled, by being set by an ignorant Porter with her head downward; which tale goes very current among the Papists. I can truly affirme, that this is a meere fiction, for I have exa|mined the Gentlewoman her selfe (being of kin to my wife, and a <HI>Rogers</HI> by name) and she hath sworn to me, she never re|ported, nor ever her selfheard, of any such misfortune.</P>
<P>But now though this Arch-Bishop <HI>(Parker)</HI> dissembled not his Marriage,
<PB N="4" REF="8">
yet Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> would not dissem|ble her dislike of it. For whereas it pleased her often, to come to his house, in respect of her favour to him (that had been her Mothers Chaplain) being once above the rest greatly feasted; at her parting from thence, the Arch-bishop and his Wife being together, she gave him very speciall thanks, with gratious and honourable termes, and then looking on his Wife, and you (saith she) Madam, I may not call you, and Mrs. I am ashamed to call, you so as I know not what to call you, but yet I do thank you.</P>
<P>It is true, she misliked Marriage in Bi|shops, and was not very forward to al|low that, in some of the Layety; for I knew one of good place about her, that had contracted himself to a rich Wid|dow, and yet would not adventure to marry her, till he had gotten the Queen to write, for that, which he had obtained before, to the intent, that the Queen re|puting that as her benefit, might not dis|like with her own act. But for Clergy men, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> and sometime <HI>impa|ribus</HI> too, she prefer'd the single man, be|fore the married.</P>

<HEAD>Of Arch-bishop <HI>Edmond Grindal.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Of Mr. <HI>Edmond Grindal,</HI> whereas my Authour writes he was blind, I have heard by some (that knew somewhat in those dayes) that he kept his house upon a strange occasion, the secret whereof is known to few, and the certainty is not easie to find out, but thus I was told; that</P>
<P>There was an <HI>Italian</HI> Doctor (as I take that of Physick) that having a known Wife a Lyar, yet bearing himself on the countenance of some great Lord, did marry another Gentlewoman, (which to do now, is by most godly Laws since made fellony.) This good Arch-bishop, not winking at so publick a scandall, con|vented him for that, and proceeded by Ecclesiasticall censures against him; Let|ters were presently written from this great Lord, to the Arch-bishop, to stop the proceeding, to tolerate, to dispense, or to mitigate the censure; but the Bishop remained still unmoved and un|moveable: when no subjects intreaty could be found to prevail, they intreat the Soveraign to write in the Doctors
<PB N="6" REF="9">
behalf; but this <HI>John Baptist</HI> not only per|sisted in his <HI>Non licet habere eam,</HI> but also in a reverent fashion, required an account of her Majesties faith, in that she would seem to write in a matter that (if sh. were truly informed) was expresly against the word of God. The Queen in a gracious disposition, was purposed to have yield|ed an account in writing; but the great Lord not onely disswaded her from that, as too great an indignity; but incensed her exceedingly against him; whereup|on, he was privately commanded to keep his house; where because he was some|time troubled with sore eyes, his friends gave out he was blind. But if he were blind, that was like to the soothsayer <HI>Tiresias</HI> that foresaw and told <HI>Pentheus</HI> ru|ine as <HI>Qvid</HI> writes.</P>

<HEAD>Doctor <HI>Whiteguift.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Upon the decease of Arch-bishop <HI>Grindall,</HI> the State desirous, to have a learned and discreet person, in so emi|nent a place; and the Queen resolved to admit none, but a single man; choyce was made of Doctor <HI>Whiteguist,</HI> then Bi|shop of <HI>Worcester,</HI> a man in many respects very happy, and in the best Judgements very worthy. He was noted for a man of great learning in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and he was grown to his full ripeness of reading and judgement; even then, when those that they called <HI>Puritans</HI> (and some meerely define to be Protestants scar'd out of their wits) did begin by the plot of some great ones, but by the Pen of Mr. <HI>Cartwright,</HI> to defend their new discipline.</P>
<P>Their indeavour as was pretended was to reduce all, in show, atleast to the Pu|rity, but indeed to the poverty, of the primitive Churches.</P>
<P>These Books of Mr. <HI>Cartwright</HI> not unlearnedly written, were more learned|ly answered by Doctor <HI>Whiteguift.</HI> Both had their reward. For Mr. <HI>Cartwright,</HI> was by private favour placed about <HI>Co|ventry,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="10">
where he grew rich, and had great maintenance to live on, and honoured as a Patriarck, by many of that Profession. Doctor <HI>Whiteguift,</HI> was made Bishop of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and there having a great good report of Houskeeping, and governing the Marches of <HI>Walles,</HI> he was (as my Au|thour hath told, called unto <HI>Canterbury.</HI> While he was Bishop of <HI>Worcester,</HI> though the revenew of that be not very great, yet his custom was to come to the Parlia|ment very well attended, which was a fashion the Queen liked exceeding well. It hapned one day Bishop <HI>Elmer</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> meeting this Bishop with such an orderly Troop of Tawny Coats, and demanding of him, how he could keep so many men, he answered, it was by reason, he kept so few women.</P>
<P>Being made Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbu|ry,</HI> and of the privy Councel, he carried himself in that mild, and charitable course, that he was not onely approved greatly, by all the Clergy of <HI>England,</HI> but even by some of those, whom with his pen he might seem to have wounded; I mean these called <HI>Puritans,</HI> of whom he won divers by sweet perswasions to con|formity. In the Star-chamber, he used
<PB N="9" REF="10">
to deliver his sentence in a good fashion, ever leaning to the milder censure as best became his Calling. He was a great stay in Court and Councel, to all oppressions of the Church, though that current was some time so violent, as one mans force could not stop that.</P>
<P>He founded an Hospitall in or nigh <HI>Croyden,</HI> and placed poor men therein, in his own life time, and being grown to a full age, that he might say with St. <HI>Paul. Bonum certamen certavi, cursum confeci, &amp;c.</HI> he was so happy, as to give to his Soveraign and preferrer, the last spirituall comfort she took in this World (I hope to her eternall comfort) and af|ter that, he not onely joyned with the other Lords, for the proclaiming of King <HI>James,</HI> but on St. <HI>James</HI> his day follow|ing, did set the Crown on his head, and anointed him with Oyl, and so having first seen the Church setled under a religi|ous King, and the Crown established in a hopefull succession, he fell into a Palsey, to which he had been formerly subject, and with no long or painful sickness, he yielded to nature, deserving well this Epitaph, written by a young Scholar of <HI>Oxford,</HI> who was with me at the writing hereof.</P>

<HEAD>Doctor <HI>Richard Bancroft.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Upon the death of Arch-bishop <HI>White|guift,</HI> divers worthy men were named in the vacancy. His Majesty not after the manner of some Princes, seeking to keep that vacant, but rather hastning to fill that. The Bishops of <HI>Durham</HI> and <HI>Win|chester</HI> were as it were, <HI>voce populi</HI> made competitrs with the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> rather by their eminence of merit and Learning, then by any known desire, or endeavour of them or their friends. Wherein methinks by the way, envy it self cannot but gratulate the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that is so furnished with learned Bishops, as if choyce had been to be made, not by a judicious Prince, but by the for|tune of a lot among those three, and ma|ny more beside, that could not have fallen amiss. But his Majesty had long since un|derstood of his writing, against the
<PB N="11" REF="11">
<HI>Genevising,</HI> and Scotizing Ministers: and though some imagined he had therein given the King some distaste, yet finding him, in the disputations at <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, both learned and stout, he did more and more increase his liking to him; So that although in the common rumour, <HI>Thoby Matthew</HI> then Bishop of <HI>Durham</HI> was likest to have carried that, so - learned a man, and so assiduous a Preacher, <HI>qui in concionibus dominatur</HI> as his emulous and enemy wrote of him, yet his Majesty in his learning knowing, and in his wisdom, weighing that this same strict charge <HI>Pasce oves mes</HI> feed my sheep, requires as well a pastorall courage of driving in the stray sheep, and driving out the infectious, as of feeding the sound, made especiall choyce of the Bi|shop of <HI>London,</HI> as a man more exercised in affaires of the State. I will add also my own conjecture out of some of his Maje|sties own speeches, that in respect he was a single man, he supposed him the fitter, according to Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> prin|ciples of state: upon whose wise foun|dations, his Majesty doth daily erect more glorions buildings.</P>
<P>But I lose labour to repeat these things
<PB N="12" REF="12">
to your Highnesse better known, then to my selfe. I should onely speak of the for|mer times.</P>
<P>Of his beginning therefore, and rising, I will boldly say that, which I would I might as truly of all that follow in this Treatise, <HI>viz.</HI> that he came to all his pre|ferments very clearly, without prejudice or spoile of his Churches.</P>
<P>He was Tutor in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> to the Lord <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who had cause to wish, and (as I have heard) hath wisht, he had staid with him longer, though he were sharp and austere. My Lord Chancellor <HI>Hatton</HI> made speciall choyce of him, to be his Examiner.</P>
<Q>Est a liquid de tot Graiorum millib&uacute;s unum a Diomede legi.</Q>
<P>By his means Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> came to take knowledge of his wisdome and suf|ficiency. He both: wrote, as I touched before, and laboured earnestly by all good means for the suppressing of the fantasti|call Novellists. After the strange and frantick attempt of <HI>Hacket</HI> and his fel|lows; which practice, though the bran|ches thereof were easily cut off, yet was it thought, to have a more dangerous and secret root. But for these his travels, as
<PB N="13" REF="12">
the Queen and State favoured him, so the seditious Sectaries (to use Judge <HI>Pophams</HI> word, that would not have them call'd Puritanes) they, l say, no lesse maligned-him in Libels and Rimes; (for they were void of reasons) laying the im|putation of Papistry unto him; some of them were punished in the Starchamber, namely one <HI>Darling,</HI> the last. Starchamber day in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time, was sharp|ly censured. And it is no wonder, if they lov'd him not, for indeed he had stoutly opposed their chiefest darlings. As for the imputation of Papistry, which they lay on all men that crosse their designes, he is so free from it, that I can truly af|firme the greatest blow the Papists recei|ved in all Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time, came from his hand, or at least from his head: For having wisely observed the emula|tion, ambition; and envy, that lurked in the minds of their secular Priests, and the Jesuits one against another, he found the means by the same policy, and with the like spirit, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> set the Phari|sees against the Sadduces, to set the Priests against the Jesuits, <HI>Watson</HI> against <HI>Parsons (Impar congressus)</HI> but yet thereby he so divided their languages, as scantly they
<PB N="14" REF="13">
can understand one another as yet. These things acted, before the King your fathers happy entry, I thought good to touch, though more sparingly then my particu|lar affection &amp; his just deserts do give me occasion. Of his late imployments of his great care, in setting; forward and setting forth all his Majesties godly procee|dings, though I know much, yet if I should say all I know, perhaps it is lesse then your Highnesse knowes; therefore I will con|clude with that which the truth, rather then my kindnesse enforceth me to say, that no Bishop since I can remember hath been counted more vigilant in looking to his charge. <HI>Ne quid Ecclesia detrimenti capiat.</HI></P>

<P>MY purpose in this work from the beginning, and my promise to your Highnesse, being to adde to this Author, a supply of some matters that he pur|posely omitted writing in the latter yeers of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and my relation be|ing
<PB N="15" REF="13">
to write plainly, without feare or fa|vour of those I doe write, I will proceed confidently, as I have begun; in which, I perswade my selfe I have some advantage of the Author himselfe, for freedome of speech, both in the time, and many other circumstances. For he was no foole that gave that rule,</P>
<Q>Mitissima sors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">est Regnorum, sub Rege novo.</Q>
<P>Againe, I being a Lay-man; am not so obnoxious to their apprehensions; that may be offended with that I shall say, as he was being a Churchman.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I lived in a place, where I might know many things without enqui|ry; which had been scarce safe for him, in that time to enquire after.</P>
<P>Lastly, he writes to the world pub|liquely, and I but privately to your High|nesse. Therefore I will proceed <HI>quoad sciam, poteroque.</HI></P>
<P>The first Bishop of <HI>London</HI> I have to write of, is Mr. <HI>John Elmer,</HI> of whom my Author hath spoken-too little, and I per|haps shall seem to say too much; yet once I thought to have said somewhat of <HI>Bonner,</HI> because I may remember him li|ving in the late Queens time unbishop|ped,
<PB N="16" REF="14">
and went sometimes abroad; but I was so young then, as I could judge no|thing; and he was so hated, that every ill-favoured fat fellow that went in the street, they would say, that was <HI>Bonner.</HI> But me thinks now, by that I have heard of him, I could liken him to <HI>Dionysius</HI> the tyrant of <HI>Syracuse,</HI> who being cruell and peremptory in prosperity, was both pa|tient and pleasant in adversity. For ex|ample, that Tyrant being expelled his Realm, and living a poore pedant, was one day with men of mean sort drinking in a Tavern, some <HI>Diogenes</HI> espying him, came to him with reverence, opening, and shaking his upper garment (for so they used in those daies, that came into the Kings chambers, to shew they had no weapons.) <HI>Dionysius</HI> perceiving the scorn, was nothing troubled, but bad him come and drink with him, and shake his clothes at the going out, that his host might see he carried nothing with him. So <HI>Bonner</HI> having twice lost his Bishoprick, walking with his Tippet in the strete, one begg'd it of him (in scoffe) to line a coat; No (saith he) but thou shalt have a fooles head, to line thy cap. And to another, that bad him good morrow Bishop <HI>quou|dam,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="14">
he straight replied, Farewell, Knave <HI>semper.</HI> I have been told also, that one shewed him his own picture in the Book of Martyrs, in the first edition, on pur|pose to vexe him; at which he laught, saying, a vengeance on the foole, how could he get my picture drawn so right? and when one asked him if he were not ashamed to whip a man with a beard, he laught, &amp; told him, his beard was grown since; but (saith he) if thou hadst been in his case, thou wouldst have thought it a good commutation of pennance, to have thy bum beaten, to save thy body from burning; but this is too much of this sloven.</P>
<P>I come now to Bishop <HI>Elmer,</HI> whom in my own particular I loved very well, and yet performing truly the taske I have un|dertaken, I shall shew perhaps no great signe of it. He was a~ man but mean of stature, yet in his youth very valiant, which he forgat not in his age.

a great Auditory, <HI>Wherefore away with your Thousands, you Bishops, and come down to you: Hundreds, &amp;c.</HI> but this was but a heat of his spirit; of which not long after, by reading and conference, he was throughly cured; in so much as being asked by one of his own ranke, after he was Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> what he meant, to preach of the brainsick fashion, he an|swered with the words of St. <HI>Paul, Cum essem parvulus, loqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">bar ut parvulus, sapie|bam ut parvulus.</HI></P>
<P>But certain it is, no Bishop was more persecuted and taunted by the Puritans of all sorts, then he was, by libels, by scoffes, by open railing, and privy back|biting. It is vulgar, yet a passage not unworthy remembring, that past between one Mr. <HI>Maddoxe,</HI> and him: For when the Bishop had recovered him about some matter concerning Paritanisme, and he had answered the Bishop somewhat untowardly and thwartly; the Bishop, (as he was ingenious ever) said unto him, thy very name exprefseth thy nature, for <HI>Maddox</HI> is thy name, and thou art as mad a beast as ever I talked with. The other not long to seek of an answer, by your favour, Sir, (said he) your deeds answer

Thus they rubb'd one another, till they were all gall'd sometimes; and the Bishop was so weary of the place, that he would gladly have removed to <HI>Ely,</HI> and made great suit for it, and was put in some hope of it. I have seen a Letter or two of his, to his friend, subscribed thus, <HI>Yours in love, but not in London;</HI> yet would he not take it with those hard conditions that were proposed, lest Mr. <HI>Maddox,</HI> and his like, might call him <HI>Ellmarr;</HI> so as it was no|ted as an ill fortune of his, to have died Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> which eight before him in an hundred yeers had not done, but been either preferred, or deprived. He was diligent in preaching at his cure, where he was first beneficed; and when his Auditory grew dull, and unattentive, he would with some pretty and unex|pected
<PB N="20" REF="16">
conceit, move them to attention. Among the rest was this: He read a long Text in Hebrew, whereupon all seemed to listen what would come after such strange words, as if they had taken it for some conjuration. Then he shewed their folly, that when he spake English, whereby they might be instracted and edified, they neglected, and hearkned not to it; and now he read Hebrew, which they under|stood no word of, they would seem so carefull and attentive. When there was talk of dangers, rumours of warres, and invasions, then he was commonly chosen to preach in the Court, and he would doe it in so chearfull a fashion, as not onely shewed he had courage, but would put courage into others. Here is much doubt, saith he, of <HI>Malum ab Aquilone,</HI> and our Coleprophets have prophecied that <HI>in exaltatione Lunae Leo jungetur Leaenae,</HI> The Astronomers tell of a watry Trigon.</P>
<P>But as long as <HI>Virgo</HI> is in that Ascen|dent with us, we need not fear of nothing; <HI>Deus nobiscum, quis contra nos,</HI> and for this, the Queen would much commend him, yet would she not remove him. But though he were stout, and wise and rich,
<PB N="21" REF="16">
yet had he beside his conflicts with those called Puritans, also some domesticall crosses. He had a Daughter, a modest Gentlewoman, and very well brought up, whom he gave in mariage to one Mr. <HI>A|dam Squire,</HI> a Minister and Preacher, and learned, but a very fantasticall man, as appeared partly the first day; for as I have heard, he would needs preach at his own Mariage, upon this Text, It is not good for <HI>Adam to be alone.</HI> This Text he so pursued, after he had been some years maried, that though his Wife were away, yet <HI>Adam</HI> would not be alone. This course bread jealousie, jarrs and com|plaints, and the Bishop as he had good cause, reprehended his Son in Law, he thinking to defend, or at least to revenge himself, by recrimination, accused her to have received a love letter from a Knight (but the Squire himself had indited that) and this was so cunningly handled by him, and with such probability, that her fault was as suspitious, as his was manifest, falshood will out at last.

tricks put on his Daughter, but no <HI>Meretrix,</HI> and being too wise to publish his own disgrace, and too stout to indure that; I have credibly heard (and believe that to be true) that with a good waster, he so mortified this old <HI>Adam</HI> of his Son in Law Squire, that he needed no other pennance but this, which was according to the old <HI>Canon per Disciplinam, &amp; ver|bera.</HI> In his Sons he was more fortunate, than many Bishops in <HI>England</HI> have been thought to have been; his eldest being a civil Gentleman, and well left, another an excellent Preacher, that hath preach|ed oft before the King, and namely one Sermon on this Text out of the 2d of the <HI>Canticles,</HI> verse 15. <HI>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes that destroy our Vines: for our Vine, have small Grapes:</HI> which Ser|mon so pleased his Majesty, that besides other approbations of that, he said to me, that if Mr. <HI>Ellmer</HI> had not had his Fathers collections and notes against Puritans, he could never have made so good a Ser|mon,</P>

<HI>Richard Fletcher,</HI> a comely and courtly Prelate, but I may say, as <HI>Tully-</HI> said, when he had commended King <HI>Dejotarus</HI> to <HI>Caesar,</HI> by the name of <HI>Rex frugi,</HI> a fru|gall, or thrifty King, he straight addeth this parenthesis, <HI>quanquam Reges hoc verbo laudari non solent,</HI> although said he, Kings are not accustomed to be praised with this word thrifty, so I might say, that comely and courtly, are no fit Epithetons for the true praise of a Prelate.

out Lands, that were now almost out of Lease, but to free him from the guilt of it, the poor Bishop must have no part of the fine. There was then a Deane whom I may not name; but to give the story more life, I will name his place for names sake of <HI>Coventry,</HI> a man of great learning, but of no great living. To him was sent one of these <HI>Foxes,</HI> the little <HI>Foxes</HI> that destroy our Vines, and make small grapes with this favourable Message, that his honourable Lord, had sent him to him, to let him know, how much he respected his good gifts (in which word also, there might be some equivocation) and though that was hard in those times, to pleasure men of his worth, according to their me|rit, yet my Lord in favour of him, hath bethought him of this course, that where|as <HI>Salisbury</HI> was then like to be void by a Remove, if this <HI>Dean</HI> would for the pre|sent take the Bishoprick of <HI>Oxford,</HI> which was then in a long vacation also, and make Leases, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">he should the next year be removed to <HI>Salisbury:</HI> the honest <HI>Dean</HI> that in his soul detested such sacri|ledge, made this mannerly and ingenuous answer.

but I pray you tell his Lordship, that in my Conscience, <HI>Oxford</HI> is not my right way, from <HI>Coventry</HI> to <HI>Salisbury:</HI> what became of <HI>Oxford</HI> I shall touch, and but touch hereafter, I come now to Bishop <HI>Fletcher,</HI> that made not so much scruple to take <HI>Bristol</HI> in his way, from <HI>Pe|terborough</HI> to <HI>Worcester,</HI> though that were wide of the right way, upon the sinister or bow hand many miles; as the Card of a good Conscience, will plainly disco|ver.

<P>Wherefore at the most <HI>I</HI> can but say <HI>Dividatur.</HI> He was a well spoken man, and one that the Queen gave good counte|nance to, and discovered her favour to him, even in her reprehensions, as <HI>Horace</HI> saith of <HI>Mecaenas.

He could preach well and would speak boldly, and yet keep <HI>decorum.</HI> He knew what would please the Queen, and would adventure on that though that offended others. Once <HI>I</HI> remember there had been two Councellors sworn within compass of one year, and neither of them had a gray hair at that time, whereupon he

<P>The Queen as I said, found no fault with his liberall speech, but the friends of these Councellers taxing him for that, I have heard he had this pretty shift, to tell the friends of either of them, he meant it by the other. Being Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and a Widower, he maried a gal|lant Lady and a Widow, Sister to Sir <HI>George Gifford</HI> the Pensioner, which the Queen seemed to be extreamly displeas|ed at, not for the by-gain of a Bishop (for she was free from any such supersti|tion) but out of her generall mislike of Clergy mens Mariage: this being indeed a mariage that was talked of at least nine dayes, yet in a while he found means to pacifie her so well, as she promised to come, and I think did come to a house he had at <HI>Chelsey.</HI> For there was a stayre and a dore made of purpose for her, in a bay window, of which pleasant wits descanted diversly, some said that was

for joy, to shew he would (as the Pro|verb is) cast the house out at window for her welcome, some more bitingly called it the Impresse or Emblem of his entry into his first Bishoprick, <HI>viz.</HI> not at the doore, but at the window. But cer|tain it is that (the Queen being pacified, and hee in great jollity, with his faire Lady and her Carpets and Cushions in his bed-chamber) he died suddenly, taking Tobacco in his chaire, saying to his man that stood by him, whom he loved very well, <HI>Oh boy, I die;</HI> whereupon many bolts were roved after him, and some spitefully fether'd, which both for cha|rity sake, as wel as brevity, I wil omit; but this blunt one, not knowing out of whose Quiver it first came; but fitting a gray goose wing, I wil produce as his most vulgar Epitaph:</P>

<P>His beginning of preferment was under the Lord Keeper <HI>Puckering,</HI> being his exa|miner, of such as sued for the benefices in my Lords gift; in which, though some complaine he was too precise, yet for my part I ascribe to that one of his greatest praises. For this I know, that a Preacher being a Noblemans Chaplaine, and there|fore qualified for two Benefices, came to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">recommended in good sort, and brought with him a Gentleman of both their acquaintance, that sometime had

been an University man, to speak for his approbation. Mr. <HI>Vaughan</HI> examined him of no very deep points, and found him but shallow, and not very ready in the Roman Tongue, his friend having been fain to help him up in two or three foule stumbles, both of language and mat|ter; whereupon he dismist him, without all hope of the Benefice, and after told the Gentleman seriously, that if he would have it himselfe, he would allow him suf|ficient, but the suitor by no means. He was in those daies very prompt, and ready in speech, and withall factious; he was an enemy to all supposed miracles, inso|much as one arguing with him in the Closet at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> in defence of them, and alledging the Queens healing of the Evil for an instance, asking him what he could say against it, he answered, that he was loth to answer arguments taken from the Topick place of the Cloth of estate; but if they would urge hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> to answer, he said his opinion was, she did it by vertue of some precious stone in possession of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> that had such a na|turall quality. But had Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> been told, that he had ascribed more ver|tue to her Jewels (though she loved them

<P>Within a few moneths there succeeded him Doctor <HI>Ravis</HI> Bishop of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> who is not formerly mentioned in this book, because Mr. <HI>Goldborow</HI> his prede|cessor in <HI>Gloucester</HI> was then living. His preferment to <HI>Gloucester</HI> makes me re|member a story that some record of <HI>Sci|pio,</HI> who being made Generall of the Ro|man Army, was to name his Questor or
<PB N="32" REF="22">
Treasurer for the wars, whom he thought fit; being a place in those daies, as is now in these, of great importance, one that took himselfe to have a speciall interest in <HI>Scipios</HI> favour was an earnest suitor for it, but by the delay, mistrusting he should have a deniall, he importuned him one day for an answer. Think not unkindness in me (said <HI>Scipio)</HI> that I delay you thus, for I have been as earnest with a friend of mine to take it, and yet cannot prevaile with him: Noting hereby, that offices of charge and conscience, are fittest for such as shunne them modestly, rather then such as seek them greedily. And even so did my Lords of the Councell deale with Mr. <HI>Ravis,</HI> who being then Dean of <HI>Christ-Church,</HI> which lightly is not held, but by some choise man of the University, being a place of good valew and reputa|tion, was requested by them to take this Bishoprick, when many that sued to have it, were put by. But as he was not willing to goe thither, so they of <HI>Glouce|ster</HI> were more unwilling he should goe thence, he was in a short space in so good liking of all sorts, insomuch as some that can scaut well brook the name of a Bi|shop, yet can be content to give him a good report.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="22">
For my part, I have observed a great change in <HI>Gloucester,</HI> from that it seemed nine yeers since, about the Earle of <HI>Essex</HI> going: into <HI>Ireland;</HI> for at that time nei|ther their Bishop seemed to care for them, lying at a Prebends in <HI>Worcester,</HI> which methought was very inconvenient; nor they seemed much to care for themselves, all their buildings both publique and pri|vate looking old and ruinous: whereas of late yeeres, their Bishop keeping his house neere them, and being daily with them, they have built them a new Market|place, and are now building a faire Hall for justice; which commendable and com|fortable disposition of the people, there and elsewhere, though it be principally ascribed to the joy and comfort that all wel affected persons took of his Majesties happy entrance, and peaceable govern|ment, and of the succession established in his hopefull issue; yet is not the leaft to be imputed to the discretion and dili|gence of the Pastors that waken and stirre up their charity, and make them more sensible of Gods good blessings bestowed on them; and the rather by this good Bi|shops means. The Lord of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> hath very Nobly, and like himselfe contributed

<HEAD>Of <HI>Stephen Gardiner.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Because I will not be alwayes be pray|sing, but sometimes when just cause is given, reprehend mens demerits, as well magnifie their merits, I will take occasion to speake somewhat of <HI>Stephen Gardiner,</HI> twice bishop of <HI>Winchester;</HI> and therefore may challenge to be twice remembred,
<PB N="43" REF="27">
though for some things of him that were to be wisht they were ever forgotten, my Author derects this Reader to Mr. <HI>Foxes</HI> booke of Martyrs, for a more full Rela|tion of his doings; but that is so full (though I assure my selfe it is very faith|full) that I doubt your Highnesse will find it over tedious to read; my purpose is therefore but to note some important ob|servations out of this Story, and after, as I did of <HI>Wickham</HI> in Latin, so to adde some English poetrie written of him, and to him, which is not to be found in Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> though some of it helps to confirme something concerning him, affirmed by Mr. <HI>Fox,</HI> and called in question by others. Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> therefore first greatly prayseth his naturall gifts of minde, his sharpe wit, his excellent memory, which is indeed the store-house of all learning and know|ledge, for <HI>tantum scimus quantum memini|mus.</HI> But to these (saith he) he had great vices, as pride, envie, &amp; cruelty, flattering to his Prince, submisse to his superiours, envious to his equals (namely to <HI>Cromwel)</HI> and haughty to his inferiours, these or the like are Mr. <HI>Foxes</HI> words. It seemes further in relation of his Life and Death, he was a Catholick-Protestant, or a pro|testing
<PB N="44" REF="28">
Catholick, for as he showes at large out of his Books &amp; Sermons, though he received the Popes authority in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> time; Yet his opinion was as his writings before declared, and as the wiser sort <HI>I</HI> thinke, do still hold of it, that it is but a temporall constitution of Men, and agreement of Princes, to allow the same, which upon just occasions they may re|straine or exclude, as they shall find cause; but yet <HI>I</HI> observe this, that although it was necessary for Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> in respect of her Birth to admit of the Popes Au|thority, as the contrary was as necessary for her Sister, yet this so Catholicke Queen, and this so popish Prelate could keep out the Popes Legat out of <HI>England</HI> by her royall Prerogative when he would have sent a Legat hither not to her li|king; again, he was earnest against Mar|riage of Ministers, yet he confesseth frank|ly, that a married man may be a Minister: he defended the reall presence, yet he al|lowed the Co~munion under both kinds, he writ in defence of Images, yet he pub|lickly approved their pulling down when they were superstitiously abused. Finally he said at his Death, that that would marre all, to teach the people, that they
<PB N="45" REF="28">
are freely justified by the blood of Christ, and yet even then, when hee could not dissemble, he confessed it to be true Do|ctrine.</P>
<P>Loe how farre this stout Prelate, <HI>Cedere nescius,</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> saith of him) did yeeld in those many points of Popery. 1. Su|premacy. 2. The marriage of some Mini|sters. 3. The Sacrament in both kinds. 4. Removing Images. 5. Justification. But now for his sharp persecuting, or ra|ther revenging himselfe on <HI>Cranmer</HI> and <HI>Ridley,</HI> that had in King <HI>Edwards</HI> daies deprived him, his too great cruelty can|not be excused.</P>
<P>Lastly, the plots he laid to entrap the Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> his terrible hard usage of all her followers, I cannot yet scarce think of with charity, nor write of with patience.</P>
<P>My father, onely for carrying a Letter to the Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and professing to wish her well, he kept in the Tower 12 moneths, and made him spend a thou|sand pounds ere he could be free of that trouble. My mother, that then served the said Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> he caused to be sequestred from her as an heretick, inso|much that her own father durst not take
<PB N="46" REF="29">
her into his house, but she was glad to sojourne with one Mr. <HI>Topcliff;</HI> so as I may say, in some sort, this Bishop persecuted me before I was born.</P>
<P>Yet, that I speak not at all in passion, I must confesse I have heard some as par|tially praise his clemency and good con|science, and namely, that he was cause of restoring many honourable houses, over|thrown by King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and in King <HI>Edwards</HI> minority. The Duke of <HI>Norfolke,</HI> (though Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> saith, that <HI>Gardiner</HI> made him stay long for his din|ner one day) yet both he, and those de|scended of him were beholding to him: with the house of <HI>Stanhops,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Arundell</HI> of <HI>Warder;</HI> and I have heard old Sir <HI>Matthew Arundell</HI> say, that <HI>Bonner</HI> was more faulty then he, and that <HI>Gar|diner</HI> would rate at him for it, and call him asse for using poor men so bloodily; and when I would maintain the contrary, he would say, that my father was worthy to have lain in prison a yeer longer, for the saucy sonnet he wrote to him from out of the Tower; which sonnet, both because it was written in defence of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and because (if I be not par|tiall, it is no ill Verse, for those unrefined
<PB N="47" REF="29">
times, and toucheth the matter I enforce) I will here set down; presupposing that in the eleven moneths before, he had sent him many Letters, and Petitions full of reason, (that could not prevaile) for his liberty. The distressed prisoner writeth this Rime.</P>

His Text was out of <HI>Eccles.</HI> 4. 2. <HI>Laudavi mortuos magis quam viventes, &amp; faliciorem utro&abque; judicavi qui nec dum na|tus est.</HI> And speaking of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> her high Parentage, Her bountifull dispositi|on, Her great gravity, Her rare devotion, (praying so much as he affirmed that her knees were hard with kneeling, Her Ju|stice and Clemency in restoring Noble Houses to her own privat losse and hind|rance.

And lastly her grievous yet pati|ent death: He fell into such an unfaign|ed weeping, that for a long space he could not speak. Then recovering him|self, he said she had left a Sister to succeed her, a Lady of great worth also whom they were now bound to obey; for saith he <HI>melior est Canis vivus Leone mortuo,</HI> &amp; I hope so shall raign well and prosperously over us, but I must say still with my Text, <HI>Laudavi mortuos magis quam vi|ventes;</HI> for certain that is, <HI>Maria optimam partem elegit:</HI> thus he, at which Queen <HI>E|lizabeth</HI> taking just indignation, put him in prison, yet would proceed no further then to his deprivation, though some would have made that a more haynous matter.

<P>I intend therefore to speak next of Dr. <HI>Cooper,</HI> because of Bishop <HI>Herne,</HI> and Bi|shop <HI>Watson,</HI> I cannot add any thing up|on sure ground, for of the former times, I have either Books of stories, or relation of my Fathers that lived in those dayes; but or these that lived in the first twenty yeeres of the Queens Raign when I was at school, or at the University, I could hear little, yet at my first coming to the Court, I heard this pretty tale, that a Bi|shop of <HI>Winchester</HI> one day in pleasant talk, comparing his Revenue with the Arch-bishops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> should say, your Graces will showe better in the Rack, but mine will be found more in the Manger, upon which a Courtier of good place said, it might be so in <HI>diebus illis;</HI> But saith he, the Rack stands so high in
<PB N="62" REF="38">
sight, that it is fit to keep it full, but that may be, since that time, some have with a <HI>provideatur</HI> swept some provender out of the Manger: and because this Meta|phor comes from the Stable, I suspect it was meant by the Mr. of the Horse. To come then to Bishop <HI>Cooper,</HI> of him I can say much, and I should do him great wrong, if I should say nothing; for he was indeed a reverent man, very well learned, exceeding industrious, and which was in those dayes counted a great praise to him, and a chief cause of his preferment, he wrote that great Dictio|nary that yet bears his name, his Life in <HI>Oxford</HI> was very commendable, and in some sort Saint-like; for if it be Saint|like to live unreprovable, to bear a cross patiently, to forgive great injuries freely: this mans example is sampleless in this age.</P>
<P>He maried a Wife in <HI>Oxford,</HI> for that speciall just cause (I had almost said onely cause) why Clergymen should ma|ry, <HI>viz.</HI> for avoiding of sin. <HI>Melius est e|nim nubere qu am uri,</HI> yet was that his very hard hap that she proved too light for his gravity by many grains, or rather many pounds. At the first he winkt at that with

a Socraticall and Philosophicall patience, taking, or rather mistaking the equivoca|ting counsel of <HI>Erasmus Ecchoe. Quid si mihi veniat usu quod his qui incidunt in uxores parum pudicas parum&abque; frugiferas? Feras.

<P>The whole University in reverence of the man and indignity of the matter, offered him to separate his wife from him by publique authority, and so to set him free, being the innocent party.

<P>After he was Bishop, mad <HI>Martin,</HI> or <HI>Marprelate</HI> wrote his book or rather Li|bell, which some (playing with <HI>Martin</HI> at his own weapon) answered pleasantly both in Ryme and Prose, as perhaps your Highnesse hath seen, or I wish you should see, for they are short and sharp. But this Bishop with authority and gravity confu|ted him soundly; whereupon <HI>Martin Madcap,</HI> (for I think his cap and head had like proportion of wit) replying, and anabaptized his bastard book by the name of <HI>Work for the Cooper;</HI> and had not the wisdome of the State prevented him, I think he and his favourers would have

About the yeere 1570. he was Vice-provost of <HI>Eaton,</HI> and as the manner was, in the Schoolmasters absence would teach the schoole himselfe, and direct the boyes for their exercises (of which my selfe was one) of whom he shewed as fatherly a care, as if he had been a second Tutor to me. He was reputed there a very milde and good natured man, and esteemed a very good Preacher, and free from that which St. <HI>Paul</HI> calleth Idolatry, I mean covetousnesse; so that one may say pro|bably, that as the first <HI>William Wickham</HI> was one of the richest Prelates that had been in <HI>Winchester</HI> a long time, and be|stowed

it well; so this was one of the poorest, and endured it well. He prea|ched before the Queen at a Parliament, I think the last time that ever he preached before her; and indeed it was <HI>Cygnea vox,</HI> sweetest, being neerest his end, which if I could set down as he delivered, were well worth the remembring. But the effect was this, that the Temporalities of Bi|shopricks, and Lands of Colledges, and such like, were from the beginning for the most part the graces, gifts, and Almes of Princes, her Majesties progenitors, that for some excesses and abuses of some of them, they had been and lawfully might be some quite taken away, some altered, some diminished, and that accordingly they were now reduced to a good medi|ocrity; for though there were some farre greater Bishopricks in <HI>France, Spaine,</HI> and <HI>Germany<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> yet there were some also lesse and meaner even in <HI>Italy.</HI> But yet he most humbly besought her Majesty to make stay of them at least in this medio|crity; for if they should decay so fast in thirty yeeres to come, as they had for thirty yeeres past, there would hardly be a Cathedrall Church found in good re|paire within <HI>England;</HI> which inconveni|ence

<P>It was said that a pleasant Courtier and Servitor of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to whom the King had promised some good turn, came and prayed the King to be|stow a Living on him, that he had found out, worth 100 li. by the yeere more then enough; why, saith the King, we have none such in <HI>England:</HI> yes Sir, said his man, the <HI>Provostship of Eaton;</HI> for (said he) he is allowed his diet, his lodging, his horse|meat, his servants wages, his riding charge, his apparrell, even to the points of his hose, at the Colledge charge; and 100 li. <HI>per annum</HI> besides. How true this is, I know not, but this I know, that Mr. <HI>Day</HI> having both this and the Deanry of
<PB N="68" REF="41">
<HI>Windsor</HI> was perswaded to leave them both, to succeed him (that had been once his Vice-provost of <HI>Eaton)</HI> in the Church of <HI>Winchester.</HI> He was a man of a good nature, affable and courteous, and at his table, and in other conversation pleasant, yet alwaies sufficiently containing his gra|vity. When he was first Deane of <HI>Wind|sor,</HI> there was a singing man in the Quire, one <HI>Woolner,</HI> a pleasant fellow, but fa|mous for his eating, rather then his sing|ing; and for the swallow of his throat, then for the sweetnesse of his note. Master <HI>Deane</HI> sent a man to him to reprove him for not singing with his fellows; the Messenger thought all were worshipfull at least that did then weare white Sur|plices, and told him Mr. Deance would pray his worship to sing; thank Mr. Dean (quoth <HI>Woolner)</HI> and tell him, 1 am as merry as they that sing; which answer, though it would have offended some man, yet hearing him to be such as I have described, he was soon pacified. He brake his leg with a fall from a horse, that star|ted under him; whereupon some waggish schollers, of which my selfe was in the <HI>quorum,</HI> would say it was a just punish|ment, because the horse was given him
<PB N="69" REF="41">
by a Gentleman to place his sonne in <HI>Ea|ton,</HI> which at that time was thought had been a kind of sacriledge, but I may also say, <HI>Cum eram parvulus sapiebam ut par|vulus.</HI> He had in those daies a good and familiar fashion of preaching not mincing the word, as some doe, with three words to feed 3000 people, that goe away all sometimes as empty as they came; nor as others, that are <HI>Nodosi</HI> drawing their au|ditory with them into deep questions and dangerous passages; that howsoever they suppose they come of themselves much admired, they leave their auditors many times more then halfe mired; but this was a good plain fashion, apt to edifie, and easie to remember; I will repeat one lesson of many, that I remember out of Sermons of his, which I can imagine yet I heare him pronouncing, and it was con|cerning prayer: It is not (saith he) a praying to God, but a tempting of God, to beg his blessings, without doing also our own endeavours; shall a scholler pray to God to make him learned, and never goe to his book? shall a husband|man pray for a good harvest, and let his Plow stand still: the Pagans, and the hea|then people would laugh at such devo|tion.

<P>Wherein Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI> became truly fortunate, according to the saying, <HI>Laudari a laudato viro, laus est maxima.</HI> Him fame doth raise, whose praiser me|rits praise.</P>
<P>From Schoolmaster of <HI>VVinchester,</HI> he became Warden, and having been infi|nitely studious and industrious in Poetry, in Philosophy, in Physick; and lastly, (which his genius chiefly call'd him to)
<PB N="73" REF="43">
in Divinity, he became so compleat, for skill in Languages, for readinesse in the Fathers, for judgement to make use of his readings, as he was found to be no longer a souldier, but a Commander in chiefe, in our spirituall warfare, being first made Bishop of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and after of <HI>Winchester.</HI> In the mean season a crew of mutinous souldiers (a forlorne hope) untertook to surprize one of the twelve fortresses of our faith, I mean one of twelve Articles of the Creed, and ere men were aware they had entred by a Postern cor|rupted, a Watchman or two thrown down a battlement and set up their Colours of white and black (black and blew had been fitter for them) publishing a book in print, that Christ descended not into Hell. The alarum was taken by many faithfull servitors of the Militant Church, but many were not found fit for this en|terprize, for that was whispered, (nay rather publisht in the enemies Camp, that some cowardly souldiers of our side had made a motion to have this Fort, or part thereof rased, because there was thought to be perill in defending of it; for so <HI>Campian</HI> writes confidently, that <HI>Cheyney</HI> Bishop of <HI>Gloucester</HI> had affirmed to him,
<PB N="74" REF="44" MS="y">
how it had been moved in a Convocation at <HI>London, Quemadmodum sine tumultu penitus eximatur de symbolo;</HI> how with|out many words it might be taken out of the Creed wholy. But I leave <HI>Erasmus</HI> eccho to answer it, oly. True it is, there was a hot shot one Mr. <HI>Browghton,</HI> no Can|nonere, for he loves no Cannons, but that could skill of such fireworks, as might seem to put out hell fire; this hot braine having with a Petard or two broken open some old dore, tooke upou him with like Powder out of some Basilisk (as I think) to shoot <HI>Hades</HI> quite beyond Sunne and Moon; such a Powder-work against all Divinity and Philosophy, as was never heard of, alwaies excepting the powder|treason. Then this learned Bishop, like a worthy leader (that I proceed in this metaphor) with a resolute Troop, not of loose shot, but <HI>gravis armaturae,</HI> arm'd to proofe out of Christs armorie, the old and new Testament, Fathers, Doctors, Schoolmen, Linguists, encounters these Lanzbezzadoes, casts down their Colours, repaires up the raines, beautifies the bat|tlements, rams up the mynes, and makes such ravelings, and counter-searfes about this Fort, that now none of the Twelve

may seem more impregnable. Their great Inginere, before mentioned, upon griefe of this repulse, is gone (as I heare) to teach the Jewes Hebrew; God send him to scape <HI>Hades</HI> at the end of his journey. Yet in the heat of these skirmishes there happened an accident worthy to be re|membred, and I think by the very devise of the divell. This Bishop preaching at <HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse, upon this Article of the Creed; and there proving by authority irrefragable, that hell is a place prepared for the Divel and his angels; that it is be|neath in <HI>corde terrae,</HI> and that Christ de|scended into it. Satan, that knew all this to be true, and was sorry to remember it, and wisht that none of the Auditors would believe it, raised a sudden and causelesse feare, by the fraud or folly of some one auditor.

<P>OF <HI>Eely</HI> I have not much to say, yet in a little I may be thought by some to say too much; which I will adventure, rather then your Highnesse shall blame me for saying nothing.

or small hospitality, or the spoyl he was said to make of woods and Parks, feeding his family with powdred veni|son; all which, I know not how truly, was suggested to her against him, in his life time, and remembred after his death. For our opinion of him in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> we held him a good scholler, and a better Poet then Doctor <HI>Haddon,</HI> who call'd him Master; whether as having been his scholler or servan't I know not; but a|mong his Poems, is extant a Distick written to B. <HI>Cox.</HI></P>

<P>As for his Church of <HI>Eely,</HI> it seemed he had no great love there, to have his mo|nument defaced within twenty yeeres (as this Authour writes) so as remembring his good beginning, one may say of him, <HI>coepisti melius quam desinis.</HI></P>
<P>But to let him rest, I must confesse that
<PB N="78" REF="46">
it was held for one of the blemishes of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Virgin raigne. First, to keep this Sea of <HI>Eely</HI> vacant so long after Bishop <HI>Coxes</HI> death, and after to take a|way so large a portion from it, as is ge|nerally spoken; yet that I may both speak my conscience, and shew my charity as well to my deceased Soveraigne, as to the reverend Bishop yet living, I will say this: First, I could wish it had not been so, and that the occasion of such a scandall between the Crown and Miter had been taken away. Secondly, I doe say for the Queen, she did no new thing; and it is held a principle of State, that whatsoever there is a president for, is law|full for a Prince. I consider further, that <HI>Eely</HI> was a Bishoprick of none of the first erections, but many yeeres after the con|quest; so as <HI>England</HI> stood christned without a Bishoprick of <HI>Eely</HI> srom <HI>Augu|stine</HI> the Monk above five hundred yeeres. It was a place also that the Crown had been jealous of for the strength of it, ha|ving sometime held out the Conquerour, as our writers affirm; and King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, a wise and fortunate Prince, said, it was not fit for a Cloyster man, and of late yeeres <HI>Mooreton</HI> undertook to hold
<PB N="79" REF="46">
it against <HI>Richard</HI> the third, for <HI>Henry</HI> the second. Adde hereunto, that though it was vacant in name, yet the profits there|of may seem to have been perhaps more charitably and honourably imployed then before, to relieve the poore distres|sed King of <HI>Portugall,</HI> who was call'd by some Schollers Bishop of <HI>Eely,</HI> which is lesse scandalous then for <HI>Jeffrey Plant a|genet</HI> to hold the Bishoprick of <HI>Lincoln</HI> for seven yeeres, without consecration, the Sea being kept voyd seventeen yeeres; and for <HI>Ethelmare</HI> to hold <HI>Winchester</HI> in like manner nine yeeres in <HI>Henry</HI> the thirds time; to omit how <HI>Stygand</HI> in the Conquerours time, and <HI>Woolsey</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth his time, both held <HI>Winchester in commendam.</HI> As for changing or aba|ting the possessions of it, the laws then in force allowed it (though a most godly law since restrained the like) and I would all the Bishopricks in <HI>England</HI> were but so well left. Now to come to Doctor <HI>Heaton,</HI> he was compelled in a sort so to take it (for <HI>potentes cum rogant jubent)</HI> and as long as there was not <HI>quid dabis,</HI> but <HI>haec auferam,</HI> the more publique it was, and by authority then lawfull he may be thought the more free from

<HEAD>Of Doctor <HI>Chaterton</HI> now living.</HEAD>
<P>Following my Authors method, I am next to speak of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> a very large Diocesse, yet not so great a Bishoprick as it hath been, which I suspect by the oft re|moves from it, as <HI>Bullingham, Cooper</HI> and <HI>Wickham</HI> in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time; and <HI>White</HI> in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> time. I'note also, that one of these removed to <HI>Worcester,</HI> namely <HI>Bullingham;</HI> of which I can ima|gine no reason, except the largenesse: of the Diocesse make it more painfull, as
<PB N="80" REF="48">
indeed it would, if the decree made in a Synod held by Saint <HI>Cuthbert</HI> in <HI>Eng|land</HI> were duely observed. Of which the third, as Mr. <HI>Fox</HI> hath it is, that every Bishop once every yeere should goe over all the parishes of his Diocesse; with which Decree by what authority men dispence, I know not, but sure few doe keep it.</P>
<P>This Doctor <HI>William Chaterton,</HI> now Bishop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and before of <HI>Chester,</HI> I may remember in <HI>Cambridge</HI> a learned and grave Doctor; though for his gravi|ty hee could lay it aside when pleased him, even in the Pulpit, it will not be forgotten in <HI>Cambridge</HI> while he is re|membred, how preaching one day, in his younger yeers, a wedding Sermon (which indeed should be festivall) as the Mar|chant Royall was at my Lord <HI>Hays</HI> marriage (with which being now in print many a good husband doth endeavour to edifie his wife.) I say, Mr. <HI>Chatterton</HI> is reported to have made this pretty com|parison, and to have given this friendly caveat: That the choice of a wife was full of hazzard, not unlike as if one in a barrell full of Serpents should grope for one Fish; if (saith he) he scape harm of the snakes, and light on a fish, he may be
<PB N="81" REF="48">
thought fortunate, yet let him not boast, for perhaps it may be but an Eele, &amp;c. Howbeit he married afterwards himself, and I doubt not sped better then his comparison. He was well beloved a|mong the schollers, and the rather for that he did not affect any soure and au|stere fafhion, either in teaching or go|vernment, as some use to doe; but well tempered both with courage and cour|tesie. Being made Bishop of <HI>Chester,</HI> he was a very great friend to the house of <HI>Darby.</HI> Preaching the funerall Sermon of <HI>Henry</HI> Earle of <HI>Darby,</HI> for some passa|ges whereof he was like to be call'd in question, though perhaps himselfe knew not so much; I was present when one told a great Lord that loved not <HI>Ferdi|nando</HI> the last Earle, how this Bishop ha|ving first magnified the dead Earle for his fidelity, justice, wisdome, and such vertues, as made him the best beloved man of his ranke (which praise was not altogether undeserved) he after used this Apostrophe to the Earle present; And you (saith he) noble Earle, that not onely inherit, but exceed your fathers vertues, learn to keepe the love of your Countrey, as your father did; you give,
<PB N="84" REF="49">
saith he, in your Arms, Three Legs; know you what they signifie? I tell you, they signifie three shires, <HI>Cheshire, Darbishire,</HI> and <HI>Lancashire;</HI> stand you fast on these three legs, and you shall need feare none of their armes. At which this Earle a little moved, said in some heat, not with|out an oath: This Priest, I believe, hopes one day to make him three Courtsies. But the two Earles I trust are friends now, both being since departed this world, (though neither as I could wish them) the one dying of a <HI>Yex,</HI> the other of an <HI>Axe.</HI> The Bishop was removed to <HI>Lincoln,</HI> where he now remains in very good state, having one onely daughter married to a Knight of good worship, though now they living asunder, he may be thought to have had no great comfort of that ma|trimony, yet to her daughter he means to leave a great patrimony; so as one might not unfitly apply that Epigram written of Pope <HI>Paulus</HI> and his daughter to this Bishop and his grandchild.</P>
<Q><L>Cum sit filia Paule, cum tibi aurum,</L>
<L>Quantum Pontifices habere raros.</L>
<L>Vidit Roma prius patrem non possum,</L>
<L>Sanctum discere id sed possum beatum.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="85" REF="49">
Which I thus translated, when I thought not thus to apply it.</P>
<Q><L>Thou hast a daughter <HI>Paulus,</HI> I am told,</L>
<L>and for this daughter store thou hast of gold.</L>
<L>The daughter thou didst get, the gold didst gather</L>
<L>make thee no holy, but a happy father.</L></Q>
<P>But if the Bishop should fortune to hear that I apply this verse so saucily, and should be offended with it, I would be glad in full satisfaction of this wrong, to give him my sonne for his daughter, which is a manifest token that I am in perfect charity with him.</P>

<HEAD>Doctor <HI>William Overton,</HI> now living.</HEAD>
<P>OF this Bishoprick may be observed, that which hapned (I think) to no other in all Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> raigne, that from the first yeere of her entrance (what time she made them all new) she never after gave this Bishoprick, but once, and
<PB N="84" REF="50">
that was to Doctor <HI>William Overton,</HI> the one and twentieth yeer of her reigne, he being then of good yeeres; so as one may probably conjecture, that he honoured his parents well, because he had the blessing promised to such, viz. that his daies have been long in the Land. I can make no speciall relation concerning him, but the generall speech as I have heard travelling through the Countrey, which is not to be contemned; for, <HI>Vox populi, vox dei est.</HI> Two speciall things are commended in him, which very few few Bishops are praised for in this age: One, that he keepeth good hospitality for the poore; the other, that he keepeth his house in good reparation. Both which I have seldome heard a married Bishop commended for; and I will be bold to adde this further, that if they would doe both those, I think no man would take exceptions either for their marriage or bigamy. The Churches also are very well kept; and for those of <HI>Coventry,</HI> they are (of Parish Churches) the fairest I have seen, though (as I partly noted before) they have had sometimes another kind of superintendency, for the Bishops keepe most at <HI>Lichfield.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="50">
The pavement of <HI>Coventry</HI> Church is almost all Tombstones, and some very ancient; but there came in a zealous fel|low with a counterfeit commission, that for avoyding of superstition, hath not left one penny-worth, nor one penny|bredth of brasse upon the Tombes, of all the inscriptions, which had been many, and costly.</P>
<P>Further I note this, that whereas in Bishop <HI>Langtons</HI> time there were many Parks belonging to the Sea, in which the Prince committed some disorder in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, now it is much altered, for he hath not past one, the rest being perhaps turned to pastures, and the Deere into tamer beasts.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="bishop">
<HEAD>Bishop <HI>Jewell.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OF how great antiquity this Bishop|rick had been in former times, two things doe especially declare. One, that ever since the conquest <HI>Ordinale secundum usum Sarum</HI> was received over all <HI>Eng|land;</HI> another, that the Clergy of <HI>Salis|bury</HI>
<PB N="88" REF="51">
were able of their owne charge to erect such a goodly Church, and stone|steeple, as that is which now stands, which at this day a subsidy were scarce able to performe.</P>
<P>To omit how <HI>Sherborn</HI> Castle, and the <HI>Devizes</HI> were both built by one Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and in this State that conti|nued till the yeer 1539. what time Doctor <HI>Capon</HI> was translated from <HI>Bangor</HI> thi|ther, a man for learning and wit worthy to be of <HI>Apollos</HI> crew; but for his spoile and havock he is said to have made of the Church-land, more worthy to be of <HI>Apollions</HI> crew, for he is noted to be one of the first that made a Capon of his Bi|shoprick, and so guelded it, that it will never be able to build either Church or Castle again. The place being in this sort much impoverished, Bishop <HI>Jewel</HI> was preferr'd unto it the first yeere of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> a Jewel indeed, as in name, <HI>Re gemma fuit, nomine gemma fuit.</HI> He, though he could not maintaine the Port his predecessors did, finding his houses decayed, and Lands all leased out, yet kept very good hospitality, and gave himselfe withall much to writing books, of which divers are extant, and in many
<PB N="89" REF="51">
mens hands, viz. <HI>His Apology of the Church of England; His challenge,</HI> answered by <HI>Harding; His Reply to the said Answer;</HI> all in English, and all in such estimation, even untill this day, that as St. <HI>Ofmond</HI> in <HI>William</HI> the Conquerours time, gave the pattern for form of service to all the Churches of <HI>England,</HI> so Mr. <HI>Jewels</HI> wri|tings are a kind of rule to all the reformed Churches of <HI>England,</HI> and hardly is there any controversie of importance handled at this day, of which in his works is not to be found some learned and probable Resolution. One thing I will specially commend him for, though I shall not be commended for it my selfe of some, and that is, whereas he defended the marri|age of Priests, no man better; yet he would never marry himselfe, saying, Christ did not counsell in vaine, <HI>Qui po|test capere, capiat.</HI> He had a very reverent regard of the ancient fathers writings, and especially St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> out of which books he found many authorities against some superstitions crept into the Roman Church. Why he had such a mind to lie by Bishop <HI>Wyvill,</HI> I cannot guesse, except perhaps of his name he had taken a Cau|rat, to keep himselfe without a wife. For
<PB N="88" REF="52">
the whole course of his life from his childhood, of his towardlinesse from the beginning, and how he was urged to subscribe in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> time, and did so, being required to write his name, saying, they should see he could write; (which shewed it was not <HI>ex animo)</HI> Doctor <HI>Humphrey</HI> hath written a severall Treatise.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="bishop">
<HEAD>Doctor <HI>John Coldwell,</HI> Doctor of Physick.</HEAD>
<P>Though Doctor <HI>Guest</HI> succeeded Bi|shop <HI>Iewell</HI> and my Author makes him a good writer, yet he shall not be my guest in this discourse, having nothing to en|tertaine him with, or rather your Highnesse with in reading of him. But how his successor Doctor <HI>Coldwell</HI> of a Physician became a Bishop I have heard by more then a good many (as they say) and I will briefly handle it, and as tender|ly as I can bearing my self equall between the living and the dead. I touched before how this Church had surfeited of a Ca|pon, which being heavy in her stomacke, it may be thought she had some need of
<PB N="89" REF="52">
a Physician. But this man proved no good Church Physicians; had she been sick of a Plurisey, too much abounding with bloud as in ages past, then such bleeding Physick perhaps might have done it no harm. Now inclining rather to a consum|ption to let that bleed afresh at so large a veine, almost was enough to draw out the very life bloud (your Highnesse will par|don my Physick metaphors, because I have lately look't over my <HI>Schola Saler|ni)</HI> I protest I am free from any desire to deface the dead undeservedly, and as farre from any fancy to insult on the misfor|tunes of the Living uncivilly, and in my particular the dead man I speake of never hurt me, and the Living man I shal speake of hath done me some kindnesse; yet the manifest judgements of God on both of the~ I may not pass over with silence. And to speak first of the Knight who carried the <HI>Spolia opima</HI> of this Bishoprick, having gotten <HI>Sherborne</HI> Castle, Park and Parso|nage, he was in those dayes in so great fa|vour with the Queen, as I may boldly say, that with lesse suit then he was faine to make to her e're he could perfect this his purchase, and with lesse money then he bestowed since in <HI>Sherborne</HI> in building
<PB N="92" REF="53">
and buying out Leases and in drawing the River through rocks into his garden he might have very justly and without of|fence of the Church or State have com|passed a much better Purchase.</P>
<P>Also that I have beene truly informed he had a presage before he first attempted it, that did foreshew it would turne to his ruine, and might have kept him from medling with it <HI>(Si mens non laeva fuis|set)</HI> for as he was riding post betweene <HI>Plymouth</HI> and the Court, as many times he did upon no small imployments, this Ca|stle being right in the way, he cast such an eye upon it as <HI>Ahab</HI> did upon <HI>Naboths</HI> Vineyard and once above the rest being talking of it, of the co~modiousnesse of the place, of the strength of the seat, and how easily it might be got from the Bishoprick, suddenly over and over came his horse, that his very face, which was then thought a very good face, plowed up the earth where he fell. This fall was ominous I make no question, as the like was obser|ved in the Lord <HI>Hastings,</HI> and before him in others, and himselfe was apt enough to construe it so; but his brother <HI>Adrian</HI> would needs have him interpret that not as a Courtier but as a Conquerour, that it
<PB N="93" REF="53">
presaged the quiet possession of it. And accordingly for the present that fell out, he got that with much labour and travell and cost, and envy, and obloquy to him &amp; his heires <HI>Habendu et tenendum</HI> but e're that came fully to <HI>gaudendum;</HI> see what became of him. In the publick joy and ju|bile of the whole Realme, when favour and peace and pardon was offer'd even to offendors, he that in wit, in wealth, in cou|rage was inferiour to few, fell suddenly I cannot tell how into such a downfall of despaire, as his greatest enemy would not have wished him so much harme, as he would have done himselfe. Can any man be so wilfully blind, as not to see and to say, <HI>Digitus Dei est hic,</HI> that it is Gods do|ing and his judgement which appeares? yet also more plaine by the sequel, for by St. <HI>Augustines</HI> rule, when adversity breeds amendment, then that is a signe it is of Gods sending, who would not have our correction turne to our confusion: so hapned it to this Knight being condem|ned to dye, yet God in whose hand is the heart of the King put into his merci|full minde against mans expectation to save his life; and since by the suite of his faithfull wife both to preserve his estate
<PB N="92" REF="54">
and to ease his restraint in such sort as many that are at liberty, tast not greater comforts then he doth in prison, being not barr'd of those companions (I meane bookes) that he may and perhaps doth take more true comfort of then ever he tooke of his courtly companions in his chiefest bravery. Neither is he without hope, that upon his true repentance, God may yet further adde to incline his Ma|jesty (e're seven times goe over his head) to a full liberty. Now to returne to the Bishop that was the second party delin|quent in this <HI>Petilarceny,</HI> or rather plaine sacriledge, what was his purpose, to make himselfe rich by making his Sea poore? Attain'd he his purpose herein? nothing lesse: no Bishop of <HI>Sarum</HI> since the Con|quest dyed so notorious a Beggar as this, his friends glad to bury him suddenly and secretly. <HI>Sine Lux, sine Crux, sine Clinco,</HI> as the old by word is, being for hast be-like clapt into Bishop <HI>Wyvills</HI> grave, that even at the Resurrection, he may be ready to accuse him and say, I re|covered <HI>Sherborne</HI> from a King, when that had beene wrongfully detained two hun|dred years, and thou didst betray it to a Knight, after that had been quietly pos|sest
<PB N="93" REF="54">
other two hundred yeares. Some might imagine this a presage that <HI>Sher|borne</HI> may one day revert againe to the Bishoprick. But there is a signe in <HI>Hy|dromanti</HI> against it. For in digging your grave (notwithstanding all the hast was made) so great a spring brake into that, as fill'd that all with water, &amp; quite wash't away the presage, so as that dead Bishop was drowned before he could be buried, and according to his name laid into a cold well before he was covered with the cold earth.</P>

<P>This Bishoprick being now reduced to a Mediocrity more worthy of pitty then envy, her Majesty (as I have heard) made a speciall choyce of this her Chap|lain, being a gentleman of a worshipfull house, and her God-sonne when she was Lady <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> whereupon it is re|ported that she said, that she had blest many of her God-sonnes but now this God-sonne should blesse her; whether she were the better for his blessing I know not, but I am sure he was the better for

hers. The common voyce was Sir <HI>Wal|tcr Raleigh</HI> got the best blessing of him (though as I said before) I rather count it a curse to have his estate in <HI>Sherborn</HI> to be confirmed that before was questio|nable. But it was his wisest way rather then to have a potent enemy and a tedi|ous suite. He married very young; for I was told some yeares since, he had nine|teene children by one woman, which is no ordinary blessing, and most of them sonnes. A man that had three sonnes or more among the Ancient Romans en|joyed thereby no smal priviledges, though the later Romans make it not a merit in a Bishop. His wifes name was <HI>Patience,</HI> the name of which I have heard in few wives, the quality in none. He hath one sonne blind (I know not if by birth, or accident) but though his eyes be blind, he hath an understanding so illuminate, as he is like to prove the best scholler of all his brethren. One especiall commen|dation I may not omit, how by this good Bishops means, and by the assistance of the learned Deane of <HI>Sarum</HI> Doctor <HI>Gour|den,</HI> a seminary called Mr. <HI>Carpenter,</HI> a good schollar and in degree a Batchelour of Divinity, was converted and testified
<PB N="97" REF="55">
his owne conversion publickly in a Ser|mon upon this Text, <HI>Acts</HI> 9. 18. <HI>There fell as it were Scales from his eyes, saying that three Scales hath bleared his sight,</HI> viz. <HI>Anti|quity, Universality,</HI> and <HI>Consent,</HI> but now the Scales being fallen away, he saw plainly, their <HI>Antiquity Novelty,</HI> their <HI>U|niversality</HI> a <HI>Babylonicall Tyranny,</HI> and their <HI>Consent</HI> a <HI>Conspiracy.</HI> And thus much be said of my god-brother, and (be it said) without presumption your High|nesse god-brother, Doctor <HI>Henry Cotton.</HI></P>

<HI>Bath,</HI> I shall add somewhat also, either o|mitted, or but sleightly touched in the Precedent booke by mine Author, but somewhat more largely handled in the Latin Treatise mentioned by him page 307. in the life of <HI>Stillington</HI> out of which I will cite a passage or two as occasion shall serve.</P>
<P>First therefore for the City of <HI>Bath,</HI> to omit all the Antiquities noted by Mr. <HI>Camden</HI> and other good Authors, as also seen by my selfe, I observe this, that a|mongst all our old Traditions and Le|gends thereof, that seemeth as it were purposely left in suspence and not yet fully determined, whether the Crowne or the Miter have more claime to the vertue that all men see and say to be in these waters. Some affirme that King <HI>Bladud</HI> a learned King, brought up at <HI>A|thens</HI> long before Christs time, either by his cunning in Magick did frame it; or rather by his search did finde it, or at least with his cost did first found it: others believe that King <HI>Arthurs</HI> Uncle St. <HI>David</HI> a Bishop of <HI>Wales,</HI> that lived longer with Leekes then we doe now with Larkes and Quailes, by his Prayer procured this ver|tue to these Springs, but this is manifest
<PB N="99" REF="56">
by most credible Histories, that <HI>Offa</HI> King of <HI>Mercia</HI> built a goodly Abby there, where before had been a Temple of <HI>Mi|nerva</HI> and <HI>Hercules,</HI> whom they feined to be Presidents of hot Bathes. This Mona|stery built by <HI>Offa</HI> 775 was destroyed by the <HI>Danes</HI> being then no Christians about the yeare 900. Then it was reedified by <HI>Elphegus</HI> a Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> 1010. and continued in great estimation for a place of holy and strickt life, but had not yet the Title of a Bishoprick, till <HI>John de Vil|lula,</HI> a French man borne and a Physician by profession, being made Bishop of <HI>Wells,</HI> which was in Latin <HI>de Fontibus,</HI> admiring the vertue of these Bathes and the Cures they wrought, for which it had been long before by the <HI>Saxons</HI> surnamed <HI>Akman|chester,</HI> that is sick mans Towne. This <HI>John de Villula</HI> thinking this place <HI>de Fon|tibus,</HI> more honourable then the other cal'd <HI>Wells,</HI> bought this City of K. <HI>William Rufus</HI> and translated his seat thither. And finding that both that Towne and Abbey had beene late before defaced with fire, he new built both about the yeare 1122 and was the first Bishop was buried there.</P>
<P>Then was that againe burned in the yeare 1132 and repaired againe by Bishop

<P>Thus <HI>Bath</HI> againe after 100 yeares, be|came the Kings, and ever may it be so. But the Church was not so sufficiently repai|red as it ought in so much that in <HI>Hen|ry</HI> the sevenths time it was ready to fall, what time that <HI>Oliver King</HI> about 100. yeares since built it againe with so goodly a Fabrick as the stone work stands yet so firme, notwithstanding the injuries of men time and tempests upon it. Here I may by no meanes omit, yet I can scarce
<PB N="101" REF="57">
tell how to relate the pretty Tales that are told of this Bishop <HI>King,</HI> by what visi|ons, predictions he was encouraged and discouraged in the building of this Church, whether some cunning woman had foretold him of the spoyle that fol|lowed, as <HI>Paulus Jovius</HI> writes how a witch deceived his next successor <HI>Ha|drian</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bath,</HI> or whether his own minde running of it gave him occasion to dreame sleeping of that he thought wa|king, but this goes so currant and confir|med with pretty probabilities. That lying at <HI>Bath</HI> and musing or meditating one night late after his devotions and prayers for the prosperity of <HI>Henry</HI> the se|venth and his children (who were then all or most part living) to which King he was principall Secretary and by him pre|ferred to this Bishoprick; He saw, or sup|posed he saw a vision of the holy Trinity with Angels-ascending and descending by a ladder, neere to the which there was a faire Olive Tree supporting a Crowne, and a voyce said, Let an <HI>Olive</HI> establish the Crowne, and let a <HI>King</HI> restore the Church. Of this dreame or vision he took exceeding great comfort and told it di|vers of his friends, applying it to the King
<PB N="102" REF="58">
his master in part, and some part to him|selfe. To his Mr. because the Olive, being the Emblem or Hieroglyphick of peace &amp; plenty, seemed to him to allude to King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, who was worthily counted the wisest and most peaceable King in all Europe of that age. To him|selfe (For the wisest will flatter themselves sometimes) because he was not onely a thiefe Councellor to this King, and had been his Ambassadour to conclude a most honourable peace with <HI>Charles</HI> the eight, who paid (as <HI>Hollinshed</HI> writeth) 745. Duckets, besides a yearely tribute of 25000 Crownes, but also he carried both the Olive and King in his name; and therefore thought he was specially designed for this Church work, to the advancement of which he had an extraordinary inclinati|on. Thus though (as St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Aquin</HI> well noteth) all dreames be they never so sensible will be found to halt in some part of their coherence; and so perhaps may this: yet most certaine it is, for the time he was so transported with this dreame, that he presently set in hand with this Church (the ruines whereof I rue to behold even in writing these Lines) and at the west end thereof he caused a representation to
<PB N="103" REF="58">
be graved of this Vision of the Trinity, the Angels and the Ladder, and on the North side the Olive and Crowne with certaine French words (which I could not read) but in English is this verse taken out of the Booke of <HI>Judges</HI> chap. 9.</P>
<Q><L>Trees going to chuse their King,</L>
<L>Said be to us the Olive King.</L></Q>
<P>All which is so curiously cut and car|ved, as in the West part of <HI>England</HI> Is no better worke then in the West end of this poore Church, and to make the credit of all this more authenticke, he added this word to it, <HI>De sursum est,</HI> it is from high. Thus much the stones and walls (though dumbe witnesses yet credible) doe plainly testifie. But in midst of all this Jollity having made so faire a beginning to his owne great content, and no lesse to the Kings, who came into this country at that time, and lay at the Deane of <HI>Wells</HI> his house nine dayes; I say in all this joy and comfort, that hapned the Kings <HI>Primoge|nitus,</HI> the Noble Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> having lately before married a great <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spaine</HI> to depart this life. This so daun|ted the heart and hopes of this good Bi|shop,
<PB N="102" REF="59">
that he doubted now his Vision would prove but an illusion, that his <HI>Oli|va</HI> would be but an <HI>Oleaster,</HI> which me|lancholy thoughts were increast in him by the predictions as I touched before of some wizards (to which kind of men that age was much affected) concerning the new Prince who was after <HI>Henry</HI> the 8^t^h, of his incest ious marriage, of the decay of his off-spring, that he should pull down what the Kings had builded, which no marvell if the Bishop being by Sirname a <HI>King</HI> mistrusted to pertaine also to his buildings. I heard by one <HI>Flower</HI> of <HI>Phillips Nortor,</HI> who said he saw <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh in this country, that this Bishop would wish he paid above the price of it, so it might have been finished, for if he ended it not, it would be pulled downe e're it were perfected. As for the later predicti|ons or rather postfictions (fince this Bi|shops death) I willingly omit concerning the Successors of this Bishop, as things worthier to be contemned then condem|ned, written by Cole-prophets upon whi|ted walls, which the Italian calls the paper of fooles. <HI>Muro bianco charta di matio,</HI> of which sort many have beene made as well by our owne Country men as others; but

<P>But to proceed in this sad story, and leave this pleasant poetry, to pursue truths and eschue fictions to imbrace reason and refuse rime, it is most apparent that after the death of this <HI>Oliver King,</HI> his Succes|sors Cardinall <HI>Adrian,</HI> Cardinall <HI>Wool|sey,</HI> Bishop <HI>Clerke,</HI> and Bishop <HI>Knight,</HI> all succeeded in five and thirty yeares, of which the first two were supposed to poy|son themselves, the third to be poysoned

by others, the last survived to see the death, or at least the deadly wound of this Church; for while the buil|ders were ready to have finisht it, the destroyers came to demolish it; yet to give the Devill his right (as the Pro|verb is) it is said that the Commissio|ners in reverence and compassion of the place, did so far strain their Commission, that they offered to sell the whole Church to the Town under 500 Marks. But the Townsmen fearing they might be thought to couzen the King, if they bought it so cheap, or that it might after (as many things were) be found con|ceal'd, utterly refused it; whereupon certain Merchants bought all the glasse, Iron, Bells and Lead, of which Lead alone was accounted for (as I have credibly heard) 480 tun, worth at this day 4800!.

<P>The next I am to write of is Bishop <HI>Barlow,</HI> of whom my Authour in this Book saith little in the Latin Treatise: there is somewhat more, and I will add a word to both. <HI>Bath</HI> (as I have noted be|fore) is but a title in this Bishoprick, so as for many years <HI>Bath,</HI> had the Name, but <HI>Wells</HI> had the game: but yet that one may know they be Sisters, Your High|ness shall understand that this game I speak of which was one of the fairest of <HI>England,</HI> by certein booty play between a Protector and a Bishop (I suppose it was at <HI>Tictak)</HI> was like to have been lost with a why not, and to use rather another mans word then mine own to explain this Metaphor: thus saith the latine Re|lation of him. He was a man no less god|ly then learned, but not so markable in any thing as in his fortunate off-spring,
<PB N="107" REF="61">
for which <HI>Niobe</HI> and <HI>Latona</HI> might envy them, happy in his own Children, more happy in their Matches (to let passe his Sonnes, of whom one is now Prebend in <HI>Wells,</HI> and esteemed most worthy of such a Father. He had five Daughters whom he bestowed on five most worthy men, of which three are Bishops at this hour, the other for their merit are in mens ex|pectation designed to the like dignity hereafter. Howbeit (saith he) in one thing this Prelate is to be deemed unfor|tunate, that while he was Bishop his Sea received so great a blow losing at one clap, all the Rents and Revenues belong|ing to it. Thus he, and soon after he tells that for his Mariage, he was deprived, and lived as a man banisht in <HI>Germany.</HI> Here is his praise, here is his dispraise. If he were deprived for a lawfull Act, no marvel if he be deprived for an unlawful: sith then my Authour compares his feli|city with that of <HI>Niobe,</HI> I will also com|pare his misfortune with <HI>Peleus,</HI> making <HI>Ovids</HI> verse to serve my turn in changing but a word or two.</P>

<P>I speak now onely of the spoil made under this Bishop scarce were five years past after <HI>Baths</HI> ruines, but as fast went the Axes and Hammers to work at <HI>Wells.</HI> The goodly Hall covered with Lead (be|cause theRoof might seem too low for so large a Room) was uncovered, and now this Roofe reaches to the skie. The Chap|pel of our Lady late repaired by <HI>Stilling|ton</HI> a place of great Reverence and anti|quity, was likewise defaced, and such was their thirst after Lead (I would they had drunk it scalding) that they took the dead bodies of Bishops out of their leaden Coffins, and cast abroad the Carcases scarce throughly petrified. The Statutes of brasse, and all the ancient Monuments of Kings, benefactors to that goodly Cathedrall Church, went all the same
<PB N="111" REF="62">
way, sold as my Authour writes to an Al|derman of <HI>London,</HI> who being then rich, and by this great bargain, thinking to have increast it, found it like <HI>auruin Tho|losanum;</HI> for he so decayed after, no man knew how, that he brake in his Majoral|ty. The Statues for Kings were shipt for <HI>Bristoll,</HI> but disdaining to be banisht out of their own Country, chose rather to lie in St. <HI>Georges</HI> Channel, where the Ship was drown'd. Let <HI>Atheists</HI> laugh at such losses, and call them mischances; but all that truly fear God will count them ter|rible Judgements.</P>
<P>These things were, I will not say done, I will say at least suffered by this Bishop; but I doubt not but he repented hereof, and did pennance also in his banishment in <HI>sacco &amp; cinere.</HI> But some will say to me, why did he not sue to be restored to his Bishoprick at his return, finding it va|cant, but rather accepted of <HI>Chichester:</HI> I have asked this question, and I have re|ceived this answer, by which I am half perswaded, that <HI>Wells</HI> also had their pro|phecies as well as <HI>Bath,</HI> and that this Bi|shop was premonstrated (that I may not say predestinate) to give this great wound to this Bishoprick.

<P>Of Bishop <HI>Gilbert Bourn</HI> I can add no|thing, and of the other <HI>Gilbert</HI> but a word, that he was a good Justicer, as saith the
<PB N="111" REF="63">
same Author <HI>(nisi quatenus homo uxoris conjugis importunitate impulsus a veri ac recti tramite aberravit)</HI> saving that some|times being ruled by his Wife, by her im|portunity he swarved from the rule of Justice and sincerity, especially in perse|cuting the kindred of <HI>Bourn</HI> his predeces|sor. The fame went that he dyed very rich, but the same importunate woman caried it all away, that neither Church nor poor were the better for it. But for Doctor <HI>God win</HI> of whom I am to speak, I must with my Authors leave add a word of mine own knowledge. He came to the place as well qualified for a Bishop as might be unreprovably without <HI>Simonie,</HI> given to good Hospitality, quiet, kind, affable, a Widdower, and in the Queens very good opinion, <HI>Non minor est vir|tus quam quaerere parta tueri,</HI> if he had held on as clear as he entred, I should have highly extold him: but see his misfortune that first lost him the Queens favour, and after forc't him to another mischief. Being as I said, aged, and diseased, and lame of the Gout, he maried (as some thought for opinion of wealth) a Widow of <HI>London.</HI> A chief favourite of that time (whom I am sory,
<PB N="114" REF="64">
to have occasion to name again, in this kind) had labored to get the Mannor of <HI>Banwell</HI> from this Bishoprick, and dis|daining the repulse, now hearing this in|tempestive Mariage, took advantage thereof, caused it to be told the Queen (knowing how much she misliked such matches) and instantly pursued the Bi|shop with letters and Mandats for the Mannour of <HI>Banwell</HI> for 100 yeers. The g&oacute;od Bishop not expecting such a sudden tempest, was greatly perplext, yet a while he held out and indured many sharp Mes|sages from the Queen, of which my self caried him one, delivered me by my Lord of <HI>Leicester,</HI> who seemed to fa|vour the <HI>Bishop,</HI> and mislike with the Knight for molesting him, but they were soon agreed like <HI>Pilat</HI> and <HI>Herod</HI> to con|demn Christ. Never was harmless man so traduced to his Soveraign, that he had maried a Girle of twenty years old, with a great portion, that he had conveyed half the Bishoprick to her, that (because he had the Gout) he could not stand to his Mariage, with such scoffs to make him ridiculous to the vulgar, and odious to the Queen.</P>
<P>The good Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> happening
<PB N="115" REF="64" MS="y">
to be pr~esent when these tales were told, and knowing the <HI>Londoners</HI> Widow - the <HI>Bishop</HI> had maried, said merrily to the Queen after his dry manner, <HI>Madam,</HI> I know not how much the Woman is a|bove twenty, but I know a Sonne of hers is but little under forty; but this rather mar'd then mended the matter. One said, <HI>Majus peccatum habet.</HI> Another told of three sorts of Mariage, of Gods making, as when <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> two young folks were coupled, of mans making, when one is old, and the other young, as <HI>Josephs</HI> Mariage, and of the Devills making, when two old folks marry not for comfort, but for covetousness, and such they said was this. The conclusion to the premisses was this, that to pacifie his persecutors, and to save <HI>Banwell,</HI> he was fain with <HI>Wilscombe</HI> for 99 yeeres, (I would it had been 100.) and so purchased his peace. Thus the Bi|shoprick as well as the <HI>Bishop</HI> were pun|ished, who wished in his heart he had ne|ver taken this preferment to foile himself in his decrepid age, with that ftain, that all his life he had abhorred, and to be made an instrument of another mans sacriledge, and used like a leaden Conduit Pipe to convey waters to others

to grace my young exercises with his Venerable presence, who from that time to this hath given me some helpes, more hopes, all encouragements in my best stu|dies. To whom I never came but I grew more religious, from whom I never went but I parted better instructed. Of him therefore my acquaintance, my friend, my instructor, and lastly my <HI>Diocaesan,</HI> if I speake much, it were not to be marvel|led, if I speake franckly, it is not to be blam~ed, and though I speake partially it were to be pardoned, yet to keep within my proportion, custome, and promise, in all these I must say this of him, his bree|ding was from his childhood in good li|terature, and partly in Musick, which was counted in those dayes a preparative to Divinity, neither could any be admitted to <HI>primam tonsuram,</HI> except he could first <HI>bene le bene con bene can,</HI> as they called it, which is to read well, to conster well, and to sing well, in which last he hath good Judgement and I have heard good mu|sick of voyces in his house. In his full time more full of Learning, he became Batche|lor of Divinity, and after Doctor, and so famous for a Preacher, and especially a disputer, that the learned'st were even a|fraid
<PB N="118" REF="67">
to dispute with him, and he finding his own strength could not stick to warne them in their Arguments to take heed to their answers, like a perfect Fencer that will tell aforehand in which button he will give the venew, or like a cunning Ches-player tha will appoint aforehand with which pawne and in what place he will give the mate; and not to insist long in a matter so notorious, it may suffice that about twenty yeares since when the great Dyet or meeting should have beene in <HI>Germany</HI> for composing matters in Re|ligion, Doctor <HI>Still</HI> was chosen for <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> and Doctor <HI>Humphrey</HI> for <HI>Oxford,</HI> to oppose all commers for the defence of the <HI>English</HI> Church, for this his knowne sufficiency he was not long unfurnish't of double honour. The Puritans in <HI>Cam|bridge</HI> wooed him, and would fain have wonne him to their part; and seeing they could not, they forbare not in the Pulpit after their fashion to glaunce at him a|mong others with their equivocations and epigrams. There was one Mr. <HI>Kay</HI> that offended them, and one said in a Ser|mon, that of all complexions the worst neare such as were Kay-cold, and in the same Sermon and the like veine he said
<PB N="119" REF="67">
that some could not be contented with a Living worth 100 <HI>l.</HI> a year, another worth 120 <HI>l.</HI> but <HI>Still</HI> will have more. But how|soever they snarl'd, this <HI>Still</HI> was counted worthy of more, so as in the year 1592. being the 34 of the late Queen he was pre|fer'd to this Sea after it had bin vacant wel nigh three years; during the vacancy I can well remember there was great enqui|ring who should have it, and as if all Bi|shops should now be sworn to follow <HI>usum Sarum,</HI> every man made reckoning that the Mannour house and Park of <HI>Bamvell</HI> should be made a reward of some Cour|tier, it encreast also this suspition that Sir <HI>Thomas: Hennage</HI> an old Courtier, and a zealous Puritan was said to have an ore in the matter, whose conscience, if it were such in the Clergy, as that was found in the Dutchy, might well have disgested a better Booty then <HI>Banwell.</HI> But when it was notified once who was named to it, I had better conceit, and straight I wrot to him as of old <HI>Cambridge</HI> acquaintance, and in such rusty Latin as I had left, gave him warning of this rumour, which he tooke exceeding kindly at my hands, though some others frowned on me for it many months after. So that for his en|try
<PB N="120" REF="68">
to it I may boldly say that I said be|fore of his Predecessor, that he came cleer|ly to it without any touch or scandall, that he brought a good report from the places where he had lived, shewed him|selfe well natured and courteous to the kindred of his Predecessor, had a farre greater fame of Learning and Merit, and which the Queen liked best of all, was sin|gle and a widdower. Nay I may com|pare them yet further, he married also soone after he was setled, and the Queene was nothing well pleased with his mar|riage. Howbeit in all indifferent censures this marriage was much more justifiable then the other for age, for use, for end; he being not too old, nor she too young, be|ing daughter to a worshipfull Knight of the same Country and a great House-kee|per, and drawing with her a kinde of alli|ance with Judge <HI>Popham</HI> that swayed all the temporall government of the Coun|try. These respects though I will not strive greatly to praise in a Bishop, yet the com|mon sort will allow no doubt for wise and provident, so as the Queenes displea|sure (your times being somewhat more propitious and favourable to Bishopricks since Bishop <HI>Wickbams</HI> Sermon) was the
<PB N="121" REF="68">
easier pacified without so costly sacrifice as a whole Mannour, and she contented her selfe onely to breake a jest upon the name of the Bishop, saying to Sir <HI>Henry Barckley,</HI> it was a dangerous name for a Bishop to match with a Horner. Since which time he hath preached before her more then once, and hath received good Testimonies of her good opinion, and God hath also blest him many wayes very greatly to see his children well brought up, well bestowed, and to have an unex|pected Revenue, out of the Entralls of the Earth (I mean the Leaden Mines of <HI>Men|dip</HI> greater then his Predecessor had above ground, so as this Bishop seemes to be blest with <HI>Josephs</HI> blessing, <HI>Benedictionibus caeli sur sum, benedictionibus Abyssi ja|centis deorsum, benedictionibus uberis &amp; vulvae,</HI> with blessing from heaven above, blessing from the deepe that ly|eth beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the wombe, which fortunate in|crease of living hapning to a provident Man that was ever <HI>Homo frugi,</HI> it is sup|posed hath brought him to a great abili|ty.

at the least (as Sir <HI>Arthur Hopton</HI> a good Knight of the <HI>Bath</HI> was wont between ear|nest and sport to motion unto him to give toward it, but the Lead to cover it which would cost him nothing, but he would reply againe, well said gentle Sir <HI>Arthur,</HI> you will coffe me as you scoffe me, which is no great token that he liketh the moti|on. Yet at his being at <HI>Bath</HI> he promised them very faire, which they are bound to rem ember to remember him of sometime by their friends. One trifling accident hapned to his Lordship there that I have thought of more consequence, &amp; I tell him that I never knew him <HI>Non plust</HI> in Ar|gument but there. There was a crafts man of <HI>Bath</HI> a Recusant Puritan who condem|ning our Church, our Bishops, our Sacra|ments, our Prayers, was condemned him|selse to dye at the Assizes, but at my request Judge <HI>Adderton</HI> reprieved him, and he was suffered to remain at <HI>Bath</HI> upon Baile The Bishop confer'd with him in hope to convert him, and first my Lord alledged for the authority of the Church St. <HI>Augu|stine;</HI> the Shoomaker answered <HI>Austin</HI> was but a man, he produced for antiquity of Bishops the fathers of the Councell of <HI>Nice,</HI> he answered, they were also but men

and might erre; why then said the Bishop thou are but a man and mayest and doest erre. No Sir, saith he, the spirit beares witnesse to my spirit I am the child of God; Alasse saith the Bishop thy blinde spirit will lead thee to the Gallowes: If I dye saith he in the Lords cause I shall be a Martyr. The Bishop turning to me stirr'd as much to pitty as impatience; This man said he is not a sheepe strayed from the Fold, for such may be brought in a|gaine on the Shepheards shoulders, but this is like a wild Buck broken out of a Parke, whose pale is throwne downe, that flies the farther off the more he is hunted. Yet this man that stopt his eares like the Adder to the charmes of the Bishop, was after perswaded by a Lay-man and grew comfortable; but to draw to an end (in one question) this Bishop whom I count an oracle for learning would never yet give me satisfaction, and that was when I askt him his opinion of witches. He saith, he knowes other mens opinions both old and new writers, but could never so di|gest them, to make them an opinion of his owne. All I can get is this, that the Divel is the old Serpent, our enemy that we pray to be delivered from daily; as wil|ling

to have us thinke he can doe so much as to have us perswaded he doth nothing. To conclude of this Bishop without flat|tery I hold him a rare man for preaching for arguing, for learning, for living; I could onely with that in all these he would make lesse use of Logick and more of Rhetorick.</P>

<P>OF this twice Bishop <HI>Scory</HI> I have heard but little, yet it hath been my fortune to read something that will not be amisse to acquaint your Highnesse with, that you may see how Satan doth sift the lives and doings of English Bishops with the Quills sometimes of strangers and Forraigners. For whereas this our English modest writer onely reports how he was first Bi|shop of <HI>Chicester,</HI> being but Batchelour; of Divinity, and deprived for no fault but that he continued not a Batchelor where|upon he fled for Religion (as the phrase was) till comming home in the yeare 1560 he was preferred to <HI>Hereford:</HI> the French writer stayeth not there, but tel|leth how that being setled there, though he professed to be a great enemy to I|dolatry, yet in another sence according to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> he became a worshipper of Images (not Saints but Angels) belike he feared some future tempest, and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">his h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> to provide better for himselfe

then he had at <HI>Chichester,</HI> so as what with pulling downe houses and selling the Lead, and such loose ends, what with setting up good husbandries, what with Leases to his Tenants, with all manner of <HI>viis et modis,</HI> he heaped together a great Masse of wealth. He that hath store of mettle must have also some drosse, and no marvaile if this Bishop then according to his name had much <HI>Scoria</HI> with this Treasure. A Noble and Honourable coun|cellour and thenLord President of <HI>Wales,</HI> hearing so frequent complaints made of him for oppressions, extortions, symonies, and the like, caused a bil to preferred into the Star-chamber against him; in which bill was contained such matter as was e|nough not onely to disgrace him, but to degrade him if it had been accordingly followed. His Sollicitour of his causes brings him a Copy of the bill, and in reading it with him seemed not a little dismaid in his behalfe much, like to the servant of <HI>Elisha</HI> that came trembling to his Master, and told him how they were beleagred with a huge Army. But this Bi|shop though not indewed with the spirit of a Prophet, yet having a spirit that could well see into his profit, bids his Sollici|tour
<PB N="132" REF="74">
(who was his kinsman, perhaps his sisters brothers sonne) to be of good com|fort; adding it may be the very words of <HI>Elisha, for there are more of our side then a|gainst us.</HI> But when his <HI>Gehezi</HI> (for the comparison suits better to the man then to the Master) could see as yet no comfor|table vision; The good Bishop did not open his eyes to let him see as <HI>Elisha</HI> did the Chariots of fire on the tops of the mountaines: but he opened his own bags and shewed him some legions or rather chiliads of Angells, who entring all at once, not into a herd of Swine, but into the hoard of a Lady that then was potent with him that was <HI>Dominus fac totum,</HI> cast such a Cloud into the Star-chamber, that the bill was never openly heard of after. This or the like and much more to the like effect writes this French Author of the said Bishop of <HI>Hereford,</HI> though the Treatise it selfe was not specially meant against the Bishop, but against a temporall Lord of a higher ranck that was not a lit|tle netled with the same.

<P>There succeeded him a learned &amp; famous Doctor indeed, Dr. <HI>Westphaling,</HI> who after he had been a Bishop divers yeeres, yet to showe that good Bishops do not quite discontinue their studies, but rather in|crease their knowledge with their digni|ty, came to <HI>Oxford</HI> at her Majesties last being there, and made an eloquent and copious Oration before her, for conclusi|on of the Divinity disputations: among which one speciall question, that bred much attention, was this, whether it be lawfull to dissemble in cause of Reli|gion? and one Argument more witty then pithy, produced by an opponent was this, it is lawfull to dispute of Religion, therefore it is lawfull to dissemble, and urging it further, he said thus, I my self now do that which is lawfull, but I do now dissemble. <HI>Ergo,</HI> it is lawfull to dissemble; at which her Majesty, and all the Auditory were very merry, I could
<PB N="135" REF="75">
make a rehearsall of some of the Bishops oration concerning this question, how he allowed a secrecy, but without dissimula|tion, a policy but not without piety, least men taking too much of theSerpent, have too little of the Dove, but I am sure in all his speech he allowed no equivocation. Howbeit, if I should-insist long hereon, I might commit the same fault to your Highness, that the Queen at that time found in him, which was that she thought him too tedious. For she had sent twice to him to cut short his Oration, because her self went to make a publique speech that evening, but he would not, or as some told her, could not put himself out of a set methodicall speech, for fear he should have marr'd it all, and perhaps confounded his memory. Wherefore she forbare her speech that day, and more privately the next morning, sending for the heads of Houses, and a few others she spake to them in Latin, and among o|there she school'd Doctor <HI>Reynolds,</HI> for his preciseness, willing him to follow her Laws, and not to run before them. But it seemed he had forgotten it when he came last to <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, so as there he re|ceived a better schooling. I may not for|get
<PB N="136" REF="76">
how the Queen in the midst of her o|ration, casting her eye aside, and seeing the old Lord, <HI>Treasur er Burleigh</HI> standing on his lame feet for want of a stool, she call'd in all hast for a stool for him, nor would she proceed in her speech till she saw him provided of one, then fell she to it again, as if there had been no interrup|tion: upon which one that might be so bold with her, told her after, that she did it of purpose to showe that she could in|terrupt her speech, and not be put out, although the Bishop durst not adventure to do a less matter the day before.</P>
<P>But this Bishop was every way a very sufficient man, and for such esteemed while he was of <HI>Christ-Church.</HI> Trifling accidents showe as good proof of times, as the waightiest occasions. Such a one hapned this Doctor while he was of the University as a Scholar of that time hath told me, and it was this. There had been a very sharp frost (such as have been ma|ny this year, and a sudden rain or sleet falling with it from the South-East, had as it were candied all that side of the Steeple at <HI>Christ-church,</HI> with an ice mix|ed with snow, which with the warmth of the Sun soon after 10. of the clock be|gan

to resolve, and Doctor <HI>Westphaling</HI> being in the middle of his Sermon, it fell down altogether upon the Leads of the Church, with such a noyse, as if indeed it would have thrown down the whole Church. The people (as in sudden ter|rors is usuall) fill'd all with tumult, and each man hasted to be gone~ so fast that they hindered one another. He first kneel|ing down, and recommending himself to God, as in the apprehension of a sodain danger, straight rose again, and with so chearfull, both voice and countenance, encouraged them as they all returned, and he quietly finished his Sermon. But his chief praise I reserve for the last, which was this; for all such benefices as either were in his own guift, or fell into his hand by Lapse, which were not few, and some of great value, he neither respected Letters nor commendations of Lords nor Knights, nor Wife nor friends in prefer|ment of any man, but onely their suffici|ency and their good conversation, so as to sue for a benefice unto him, was rather a means to miss then to attain it.</P>

This is he (if your Highness do remember it) of whom his Majesty said, if he were to chuse a Bishop by the aspect, he would chuse him of all the men he had seen, for a grave reverent and pleasing countenance. Concurring here|in in a sort, though by contraries with the judgement of <HI>Henry</HI> the fou~rth Em|perour, who comming from hunting one day (as <HI>Malmesbury</HI> writeth) went for de|votion sake into a Church, where a very ill-favoured faced Priest was at service. The Emperour thinking his virtues suted his visage, said to himself, how can God like of so ugly a fellows service. But it fortuned at that instant, the Priests boy mumbling of that versicle in the hundred Psalm, <HI>Ipso nos fecit &amp; non ipsi nos,</HI> and because he pronounced it not plainly, the Priest reproved him, and repeated it a|gain, aloud, <HI>Ipse nos fecit &amp; non ipsi nos,</HI> which the Emperour applying to his own

Cogitation, thought the Priest to have some prophetical spirit, &amp; fromthat time forward esteemed him greatly, and made him a Bishop.

This Bishop your Highness knoweth so well, and have heard him so oft, as it may be you think it needless to hear more of him. But I will be bold to say your Highness doth but half know him, for the vertues that are not seen in him, are more and greater then those that are seen, I will therefore play the blab so far, that your Higlmess may know him better. He was born in <HI>London,</HI> and train|ed up in the School of that famous <HI>Mul|caster,</HI> and for the speciall towardness was found in him in very young yeares, he was not onely favoured, but had libe|rall exhibition given him by a great Councellor of those times, as I shall note hereafter. The course of his study was
<PB N="142" REF="79">
not as most mens are in these times, to get a little superficiall fight in Divinity, by reading two or three of the new wri|ters, and straight take Orders, and up in|to the Pulpit. Of which kind of men a Reverent Bishop yet living said as proper|ly as pleasantly, when one told of a young man that preached twice every Lords day, beside some exercising in the Week dayes, it may be (saith he) he doth talk so often, but I doubt he doth not preach. And to the like effect the late Queen said to the same Bishop, when she had on the Fryday heard one of those talking Preachers much commended to her by some body, and the Sunday after heard a well labour'd Sermon that smelt on the Candle, I pray said the, let me have your bosom Sermons, rather then your lip-Sermons; for when the Preacher takes pains, the Auditor takes profit. But to come to Doctor <HI>Andrews</HI> that gathered before he did spend, reading both new Writers and old Writers, not as tasting but as disgesting them, and finding ac|cording to our Saviours saying. <GAP DESC="foreign"> the old to be more profita|ble, at last his sufficiency could be no longer conceal'd. But as an industrious
<PB N="143" REF="79">
Marchant that secretly and diligently follows his Trade with small showe, till his wealth being grown so great, it can be no longer hidden, is then call'd on for Subsidies and Loans, and publique services: so did this mans excellencies suddenly break forth. His Patron that studied projects of policy, as much as precepts of piety, hearing of his fame, and meaning to make use thereof, sent for him (as I have credibly heard) and dealt earnestly with him, to hold up a side that was even then falling, and to maintain certain state points of Puritanisme. But he had too much of the <GAP DESC="foreign"> in him to be scar'd with a Councellors frown, or blown aside with his breath, answered him plainly, they were not onely against his Learning, but his Conscience. The Councellor seeing this man would be no Fryer <HI>Pinhie</HI> (to be taught in a Closet what he should say at <HI>Pauls)</HI> dismist him with some disdain for the time; but afterward did the more reverence his in|tegrity and honesty, and became no hin|derer to his ensuing preferments. Of these one was a Prebend in <HI>Pauls,</HI> belonging to him, they call the Confessor or Confessi|oner, a place notoriously abused in time
<PB N="144" REF="80">
of Popery by their tyranny and superstiti|tion; but now of late by a contrary ex|tream too much forgotten and neglected: while he held this place, his manner was, especially in <HI>Lent</HI> time, to walk duly at certain hours, in one of the Iles of the Church, that if any came to him for spi|rituall advice and comfort, as some did, though not many, he might impart it to them. This Custom being agreeable to Scripture, and Fathers, expressed and re|quired in a sort in the Communion Book, not repugning the 39 Articles, and no lesse approved by <HI>Calvin</HI> in his Instituti|ons, yet was quarrel'd with by divers (upon occasion of some Sermons of his) as a point of Popery. The like scandall was taken of some, though not given by him, for his reverent speaking of the highest Mystery of our Faith and heaven|ly food the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> which some are so stiffe in their knees, or rather in their hearts, that they hold it Idolarry to receive that kneeling. But whatsoever such barked at, he ever kept one tenor of life and Doctrine <HI>Exemplar</HI> and unre|proveable.</P>
<P>Two speciall things I have observed in his Preaching, that I may not omit to
<PB N="145" REF="80">
speak of. One to raise a joynt reverence to God and the Prince, to spirituall and civill Magistrate, by uniting and not severing them.</P>
<P>The other to lead to amendment of Life, and to good works, the fruits of true Repentance.</P>
<P>Of the first kind, he made a Sermon before the Queen long since, which was most famous of this Text. <HI>Thou leddest thy people like Sheep by the hands of</HI> Moses <HI>and</HI> Aaron. Which Sermon, (though courteous ears are commonly so open, as it goes in at one ear, and out at the o|ther) yet it left an <HI>Aculeus</HI> behind in ma|ny of all sorts. And <HI>Henry Noel</HI> one of the greatest Gallants of those times, sware as he was a Gentleman, he never heard man speak with such a spirit. And the like to this was his Sermon before the King, of two silver Trumpets to be made of one peece. Of the second kind I may say all his Sermons are, but I will menti|tion but his last, that I heard the fifth of the last <HI>November,</HI> which Sermon I could wish ever to read upon that day. <HI>When the Lord turned the Captivity of Sion, &amp;c.</HI> And I never saw his Majesty more sweet|ly affected with any Sermon then with
<PB N="146" REF="81">
that. But to conclude, I perswade my self, that whensoever it shall please God to give the King means, with consent of his confederate Princes to make that great peace which his blessed word <HI>Beati Paci|fici</HI> seemeth to promise, I mean the end|ing of this great Schisme in the Church of God, procured as much by ambition, as by superstition; This reverent Pre|late will be found one of the ablest, not of <HI>England</HI> onely, but of <HI>Europe,</HI> to set the course for composing the controver|sies, which I speak not to add reputation to his sufficiency by my judgement; but rather to win credit to my judgement by his sufficiency. And whereas I know some that have known him so long as I have, yet have heard and believe no lesse of his Learning then I speak, find fault that he is not so apt to deliver his resolu|tion upon every question moved as they could wish, who if they be not quickly resolved of that they aske, will quickly resolve not to care for it. I say this Cunctation is the mean between Preci|pitation and Procrastination, and is spe|cially commended by the Apostle St. <HI>James,</HI> as I have heard him alledge it, <HI>Sit omnis homo</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>tar|dus</HI>

For the reputation of Poetry is so altered by the iniquity of the times, that whereas it was wont to make simple folke believe some things that were false, now it makes our great

wise men to doubt of things that be true. When the Creed was first put into Eng|lish verse, as it is now sung in the Church, the descending of Christ into Hell, was never questioned, but since it hath been sung 50 yeere or more,</P>

<P>AT <HI>Glocester</HI> I shall at this time make a very short bait, the last Bishop there|of being but lately removed to <HI>London,</HI> and the present Bishop scant yet warme in his seat; yet this I must say, that I have heard some students of good judgement that knew him in <HI>Oxford</HI> affirme, that in his very young yeares he gave a great hope and good presage of his future excellency, having a rare gift <HI>ex tempore</HI> in all his Schoole exercises, and such a happy wit to make use of all occurrents to his purpose, as if he had not taken the occasions, as they fell out by accident, but rather bespo|ken such pretty accidents to fall out to give him the occasions.

How beit the ground on which I would build his chiefe praise (to some of the <HI>Aristarchy</HI> and sowre censures of these daies, requires first an Apologie. For I remember that even in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> about twenty five yeers since,
<PB N="154" REF="85">
and I am sure he remembers it too) a que|stion arose among the Divines scarce fit for the Schooles, lesse fit for the Pulpit, yet was it both handled and determined in the Pulpit, whether Rhetoricall Fi|gures and Tropes, and other artificiall ornaments of speech taken from pro|phane authors, as sentences, adages, and such like, might be used in Sermons, and not rather the plaine naked truth delive|red out of the word of God. The precise fort, that would have the Word, and Church and all goe naked, saving some Apron perhaps of Fig-leaves, were not onely earnest but bitter against the use of all such humane, or (as they call them) prophane helps, calling them paintings fitter for Strumpets, then for chaste Ma|trons. But the graver and more Ortho|dox were of the other opinion, and namely my learned Tutor Doctor <HI>Flem|ning,</HI> by appointment of the heads of the Colledges in an excellent Sermon deter|mined the controversie. That seeing now the extraordinary gift, first of tongues, then of miracles was ceased, and that knowledge is not now <HI>Infusa</HI> but <HI>Acqui|sita,</HI> we should not despise the helpe of any humane learning, as neither St. <HI>Paul</HI>

brevities sake by some Fryer in a ryming verse, <HI>Roma semel quantum, Bis dat Mene|via tantum.</HI> This place hath yielded ma|ny excellent Bishops, as well for good Learning as good life, and for abstinence miraculous, if we believe stories that 33. Bishops successively did eat no flesh. I can adde little of the Bishops save of him that now lives whom if I knew not, yet by his Looke I should guesse to be a grave and austere man, even like St. <HI>David</HI> him|selfe, but knowing him as I doe, he was in more possibility to have proved like to St. <HI>John Baptist</HI> in my opinion. There is almost none that waited in Queen <HI>E|lizabeths</HI> Court and observed any thing, but can tell, that it pleased her very much to seeme, to be thought, and to be told that shee looked young. The Ma|jesty and gravity of a Scepter borne 44. yeares could not alter that nature of a woman in her; This notwithstanding, this good Bishop being appointed to Preach before her in the Lent of the yeere 1596, the Court then lying at <HI>Richmond,</HI> wishing in a godly zeale, as well became him, that she should thinke sometime of Mortality, being then 63. years of age, he tooke this text fit for that purpose out of

the Psalms, Psalm. 90. <HI>vers.</HI> 12. <HI>O teach us to number our dayes, that we may incline our heart unto wisedome,</HI> which Text he handled so well, so learnedly, and so re|spectively, as I dare undertake &amp; so should I if I had not been somewhat better ac|quainted with the humour, that it would have well pleased her, or at least no way offended her. But when he had spoken a while of some sacred and mysticall num|bers, as three for the Trinity, three times three for the heavenly Hierarchy seven for the Sabbath, and seven times seven for a Jubile; and lastly (I doe not de|liver it so handsomely as he brought it in) seven times nine for the grand Clima|ctericall yeare; she perceiving whereto it tended began to be trouled with it. The Bishop discovering all was not well, for the Pulpit stands there <HI>Vis a vis</HI> to the Closet, he fell to Treat of some more plausible numbers, as of the number 666. making <HI>Latinus</HI> with which he said he could prove the Pope to be Antichrist also, of the fatall number of 88. which being so long before spoken of for a dangerous year, yet it hath pleased God that yeare not onely to preserve her but to give her a famous victory, against the united For|ces

of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Spaine;</HI> and so he said there was no doubt but she should passe this year also and many more, if she would in her meditations and Soliloquies with God, as he doubted not she often did, and would say thus and thus. So making indeed an excellent prayer by way of <HI>Pro|sopopeia</HI> in her Majesties person acknow|ledging Gods great graces and benefits, and praying devoutly for the continuance of them, but withall interlarding it with some passages of Scripture that touch the infirmities of age; as that of <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI> 12. <HI>When the Grynders shall be few in num|ber, and they wax darke that looke out of the windowes</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and the Daughters of singing shall be abased:</HI> and more to like purpose, he concluded his Sermon. The Queen as the manner was opened the window, but she was so farre from giving him thanks or good countenance, that she said plainly he should have kept his Arithmetick for himselfe, but I see said she the greatest Clerks are not the wisest men, and so went away for the time discontented. The Lord Keeper <HI>Puckering</HI> though reve|rencing the man much in his particular, yet for the present to asswage the Queens displeasure, commanded him to keep his

house for a time, which he did. But of a truth her Majesty shewed no ill nature in this, for within three dayes after she was not onely displeased at his restraint, but in my hearing rebuked a Lady yet living for speaking scornefully of him and his Sermon. Onely to shew how the good Bishop was deceived in supposing she was so decayed in her limbes and senses as himself perhaps &amp; other of that age were wont to be; she said she thankt God that neither her stomack nor strength, nor her voyce for singing nor fingring Instru|ments; nor lastly, her sight was any whit decayed, and to prove the last before us all she produced a little Jewell that had an inscription of very small Letters, and offered it first to my Lord of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and then to Sir <HI>James Crofts</HI> to read, and both protested <HI>bona fide</HI> that they could not, yet the Queen her selfe did finde out the Poesie, and made her selfe merry with the standers by upon it; and thus much for St. <HI>Davids.</HI> Yet I have been told of a strange story of a huge waight and bignesse that hath a pretty quality, name|ly, that with one finger you may stir it, yet twenty yoke of Oxen cannot remove it; but I rather think it is mistaken, for

Howbeit, though he might seeme for name sake to favour the Kitchen, yet in spoyling that sea hee was as little friend to the Kitchen as the rest, spoyling the woods and good provi|sions that should have warm'd it, which gave occasion to Doctor <HI>Babbington,</HI> now Bishop of <HI>Worcester,</HI> to call it <HI>Aph</HI> with|out Land, and Doctor <HI>Morgan</HI> after to remove to Saint <HI>Assaph,</HI> from thence not for name sake, but for his own name sake, that is <HI>More-gaine:</HI> At what time the pre|sent Bishop I now speake of, being then Sub-Deane of <HI>Exeter,</HI> Doctor <HI>Francis Godwin,</HI> having that yeare newly publi|shed this worke, she gave him presently this Bishoprick, not full two moneths va|cant, and would as willingly have given him a much better in her owne dispositi|on, as may well appeare in that she gave Doctor <HI>Cooper</HI> the Bishoprick of <HI>Lincoln<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> onely for making a Dictionary, or rather but for mending that which Sir <HI>Thomas Eliot</HI> had made before.

therefore I may speake sparingly, yea, ra|ther spare all speech, considering that e|very leafe of his worthy worke, is a suffi|cient testimony of his vertuous mind, un|fatigable industry, and infinite reading; for even as we see commonly, those Gen|tlemen that are well descended, and bet|ter bred, are most carefull to preserve the true memory and pedigree of their An|cestors, which the base and ignorant, be|cause they could not conserve, will seeme to condemne: So this worthy Bishop, col|lecting so diligently, &amp; relating so faith|fully the succession and lives of so many of our Christian most reverend Bishops in former ages, doth prove himselfe more by spirituall, then carnall birth, to come of those Ancestors, of whom it was long be|fore prophecyed by the princely Prophet, <HI>In stead of thy Fathers, thou shalt have Chil|dren whom thou shalt make Princes in all places.</HI> Though the policy of these latter times hath sought to make our Fathers all but Children, and younger brothers (as they say) and to disinherit them of their patrimonie; he deserveth therefore a pen much better then mine, and equall to his own, to doe that for him he hath done for others.

<HI>eter,</HI> I had some acquaintance with him, and have heard him preach more then once at our Assizes and else where, his manner was to be sharpe against the Vices most abounding in that time, Sacriledge Symony, contempt of God in his Mini|sters, and want of Charity.

This speech was so ill taken by some guilty consci|ence, that a great matter was inforc'd to be made of it, that it was a dangerous &amp; seditious speech; and why? forsooth be|cause it was a deare yeare; but see how a mans enemies sometimes doe him as much good as his friends: their fond ac|cusation &amp; his discreet justification made him both better known, &amp; more respected by them that were able to doe him most good.

which there hath bin seven Arch-bishops <HI>of Yorke,</HI> that these have been as excellent in courage, in learning, and eloquence; for Doctor <HI>Nicholas Heath</HI> whom her late Majesty found both Arch-bishop and Chancellor (though she did take or rather receive both from him) yet did she ever gratefully acknowledge both his courage &amp; fidelity show'd in her cause, &amp; used no man of his Religion so graciously. Of Arch-bishop <HI>Grindall</HI> I have spoken be|fore, and in his due place given him his due praise; now I am to adde a word or two of Arch-bishop <HI>Young,</HI> that in the third yeare of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was made Arch-bishop. He was first Bishop of Saint <HI>Davids,</HI> and either next or very soon after Bishop <HI>Farrar,</HI> who among other articles that were alleaged against him, had one that I thinke was never alleaged against Clergy-man or Lay-man before, and that was for riding on a Scottish saddle; but this Bishop walked more warily then that Bishop did ride, so as this came to live in a state when t'other died at a stake: and how great soever his honour was in being both Arch-bishop and President, he left one president that too many are apt to follow, which was the pulling downe of

a goodly Hall, for the greedinesse of the Lead that covered it. <HI>Plumbi faeda fames.</HI> A drossie desire and unworthy part, with which he stained the reputation of learn|ing and religion, that was before ascribed to him, and although by meanes of some great friend this was lesse spoken of in his life time then after, yet if I have beene rightly informed, even by that he was made no great gainer. True it is, he pur|chased great things of the Earle of <HI>Arun|dell,</HI> and how his heires thrive with it, I do not heare, but there is a perilous verse, <HI>Demale quaesitis vix gaudet tertius baeres.</HI> For my owne part I must confesse, that where I finde that same destroying and reviving spirit, that in the Apocalyps is named in Hebrew <HI>Abaddon,</HI> &amp; sounds in my English care and heart, <HI>a bad one,</HI> I suspect there is little true vertue or godlines harbour'd in that breast. But if he were finely beguil|ed of all this Lead by his great friend that would be bold with him, <HI>I</HI> imagin that none that heares it will much lament it; at a venture, <HI>I</HI> will tell your Highnesse the tale that <HI>I</HI> heard, from as good a man as <HI>I</HI> tell it of, onely because he named not the parties, <HI>I</HI> cannot precisely affirme it was this man, but <HI>I</HI> dare affirme this man

<P>But the Story that I make this long in|troduction unto is shortly this. About 25. yeares fince there was great kindnesse, and had long continued between Archbishop Sands and Sir <HI>Robert Stapleton</HI> a Knight of <HI>Yorkeshire,</HI> whom your Highnesse hath often seen, who in those dayes for a man well spoken, properly seen in Languages, a comely and goodly Personage, had scant an equall, and (except Sir <HI>Philip</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="95">
<HI>Sidney)</HI> no superiour in <HI>England:</HI> for which Reasons the Arch-bishop of all his Neighbours and Countreymen, did make a speciall account of him. About the year 83. also he was High-Sheriffe of <HI>York-shire,</HI> and met the Judges with seven score men in sutable Liveries, and being at this time likewise a Widdower, he wooed and won, and wedded soon after, one of the best reputed Widdows in the <HI>West</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> In this felicity he sail|ed with ful sails, but somewhat too high, and no lesse the Arch-bishop in like pro|sperity of wealth, and friends and Chil|dren, yet seeming above all, to joy in the friendship of this Knight, who answered in all good correspondence, not onely of outward complement, but inward com|fort; but well said the <HI>Spanish</HI> Poet,</P>
<Q><L><HI>Nulli te facias nimis sodalem,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Gaudebis minus &amp; minus. dolebis.</HI></L>
<L>Too much Companion make your self to none,</L>
<L>Your joy will be the lesse, and less your mone.</L></Q>
<P>These two so friendly Neighbours and Consorts swimming in this Calm of con|tent, at last hapned to fall foul one on an|other by this occasion. The Knight in
<PB N="176" REF="96">
his great good fortunes, having as great defigns among other things, had laid the foundation of a fair house, or rather Palace, the model whereof he had brought out of <HI>Italy,</HI> which house he in|tended to name <HI>Stapletons stay;</HI> and for that cause invited the Arch-bishop in good kindness to see it, and requested him for the more credit, and as it were, blessing to the house, that his grace would give it the foresaid name. But when the Arch-bishop had fully beheld it, and in his Judgement found it fitter for a Lord Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI> then for a Knight of <HI>York-shire.</HI> He said to him, would you have me call this intended House <HI>Stapletons Stay.</HI> Nay rather let me say to you, stay <HI>Stapleton;</HI> for if you go forward to set up this House, it will pull you down. How often a man loses a friend with a jest, and how grievous it is for a mans vanity to be crost in the hu|mour. This speech of my Lords that I should think, intended friendly, uttered faithfully, and applyed even fatherly un|to him, he took in so deep disdain and despite, that howsoever he smothered it for the present, from that time forward he sought a mean to revenge it. And
<PB N="177" REF="96">
wanting neither wit to devise, nor cou|rage to execute his design, he found out, or at least he supposed he had found a stratagem, not onely to wreak this scorn on the good Bishop that mistrusted no|thing, but also to make the old mans purse pay for the finishing of the new house. He acquaints him with an Officer in my Lords house, some malecontent that had been denyed a Lease. These two devise, that when my Lord should lie next at <HI>Doncaster,</HI> where the Hostess of the house having been (formerly I sup|pose) Mistriss <HI>Sands</HI> Maid, was bold sometimes to bring his Lordship a Cawdle to his Beds side (for in charity I may surmise no worse) Sir <HI>Robert</HI> should also by chance come and host at the same house. This bad Wife and her good man are made partakers and parties of this stratagem, her part was but a naked part, <HI>viz.</HI> to slip into my Lords Bed in her smock, mine Hoast must sodainly be jea|lous, and swear that he holds his reputa|tion, though he be but a poor man, more dear then that he can indure such an in|dignity, and thereupon calls Sir <HI>Robert Stapleton,</HI> brings him to the Bishops Chamber in his Night-gown, takes them
<PB N="178" REF="97">
in bed together with no small exclamati|on. The Knight that acted his part with most art, and leaft suspition, takes great pains to pacifie the Hoast, conjures all that were admitted to secresie and si|lence, and sending all to their Lodgings without tumult, asketh of my Lord how this came to passe. The Bishop tells him with a great Protestation, that he was be|trayd by his man and his Hoast, little su|specting the Knight to be of the <HI>Quorum.</HI> The Knight sooths him in all he said, condoles the great mischance, is sorrow|full for the danger, and carefull for the honour of the Bishop, and specially the Church.</P>
<P><HI>Proh superi quantum mortalia pecior a caecae Noctis habent? ipso sceleris molimine (Miles) Creditur esse pius.</HI> The distressed Arch|bishop distrusting no fraud in him, ask|eth his advise in this disaster, and follow|ing his counsel from time to time, gives the Hoast a peece of money, the false Of|ficer a Farm, and the Knight for his tra|vail in this matter many friendly recom|pences. But when he found after all this smoothing and soothing, that he grew so bold at last to presse him beyond all good manner, for the good Mannour
<PB N="179" REF="97">
of <HI>Soothwell,</HI> then he found that in sooth all was not well, and was even compell'd too late, to that he might much better have done much sooner, <HI>viz.</HI> To com|plain to the Lords of the Councel, and to his ancient and dear friend, the Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI> (for whose Father he had almost lost his life) by whose help, he got them call'd to the Star-chamber. <HI>Ore tenus,</HI> where they were for this conspiracy con|victed, fined and imprisoned. The fame, or rather the infamy of this matter spe|cially before their conviction was far and diversly spread, according as the Report|ers favoured or disfavoured either: and the friends of each side had learned their tale so perfect, that many long time after, held the first impression they had recei|ved, notwithstanding the censure and sen|tence in the Starr-chamber. Part where|of being, that the Knight should publick|ly acknowledge how he had slandered the Arch-bishop, which he did in words conceived to that purpose accordingly, yet his friends gave out, that all the while he carried a long Whetstone hanging out at the Pocket of his sleeve, so conspicu|ous, as men understood his meaning was to give himself the lie, which he would
<PB N="180" REF="98">
not in another matter have taken of any man. But thus the Bishop had a Con|quest which he had no great comfort of, and lived but few years after it, and the Knight had a foile that he would not seem much daunted with, and lived to have part of his fine releast by his Maje|sties clemency; but yet he tost up and down all his life without any great con|tentment, from <HI>Wiltshire</HI> into <HI>Wales,</HI> and thence to the Isle of <HI>Man,</HI> a while to <HI>Chel|sey,</HI> but little to <HI>York-shire</HI> where his stay should have been, so that of this story I could collect many documents, both for Bishops and Knights, but that I shun pro|lixity in a matter no way pleasing. How|beit because one <HI>P. R.</HI> or <HI>R. P.</HI> for he can turn his name as Mountebank turns his Capp, in his Epistle before the Reso|lution (a Book much praised by Sir <HI>Ed|win Sand,</HI> hath a scoffe after his manner at this Hostess of <HI>Doncaster;</HI> I would pray him but to peruse the Life of St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> not that of their lying Legend, but that which unworthily perhaps goeth among his most worthy works, written by <HI>William Abbot</HI> in five Books. There he shall find in the third Chapter of his first Book, how that same maidenly Saint
<PB N="181" REF="98">
was subject to the like manner of scan|dall: first, of a young woman lying by him in naked bed, half a night when him|self was not 30 year old, and yet we must believe he toucht her not; and next of his Hostess also offering three timesin one night to come to his Bed, and he crying out each time, <HI>Latrones, Latrones,</HI> Theeves&punc; Theeves, which our Bishop had much more cause to have cryed, and had he but remembred it, as I doubt not but he had read it, he might peradventure have dissolved the pack with it. To utter mine own conceit franckly, if <HI>Parsons</HI> conje|cture were true, that by humane frailty this Prelate had in his younger dayes been too familiar with this woman, which is said to passe but as a veniall sin among those of his Profession, yet was the Knights practise very foul, and the Lords censure very just that condemned him: for I heard Judge <HI>Anderson,</HI> a learned and stout Judge, condemn one for a Rape, up|on the Oath of a Woman (notwithstand|ing, the man affirmed, and the Woman denyed not, but she had often in former times yielded her self to his lust) because it seemed she had repented that course of life, in betaking her to a Husband. So my
<PB N="182" REF="99">
Lord, if he had once such a fault, yet now that the fault had left him, as well as he the fault, had just cause to complain, and the Knights practise was blame-wor|thy to seek to entrap him thereby to the spoile of the Church and disgrace of his calling. And the Arch-bishop did much noblier to hazard this obloquie of some idle tongues then to have incurred the greater scandall of betraying his Church. To conclude therefore, I wish all Squires and all Knights to be fuller of reverence toward Bishops and Arch-bishops, and not to oppose or contest with them. The play at Chess, a Game not devised for or by fooles may teach, that the Bishops due place is nearest the King, and though some Knight can leap better over the pawns heads, yet ofttimes he leaps short, where the Bishops power, if you crosse it, reacheth the length of the whole Pro|vince.</P>

<HEAD>Doctor <HI>John Piers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Of this Doctor <HI>John Piers,</HI> who lived and dyed a moft reverent Prelate, I must, to give him the greater commendation, do like those, that when they will enforce
<PB N="183" REF="99">
them to leap their farthest, go back the contrary way some part of the ground, and by little and little amending their pace, at laft over-leap the mark them|selves had designed, so shall I look back into some part of his life, and showe first how unlikely he was to come to such high honour and place as he dyed in. For although he was a Scholar towardly e|nough in his youth, of good wit, and not the meanest birth, having a Gentleman of good sort to his Brother: yet hasting to a competent ftay of life, he accepted of a small Benefice in the Countrey, as I take it near <HI>Oxford,</HI> and there was in great hazard to have drowned all those excellent guifts that came after to be so well esteemed and rewarded in him: there first he was enforced to keep mean and rusticall Company, that Company enticed him to the German fashion, even then grown too common in <HI>England,</HI> to sit whole nights in a Tipling house at Ale and Cakes, as <HI>Ennius &amp; Cato</HI> are noted, of the former of whom <HI>Horace</HI> saith, <HI>En|nius ipse pater nunquam nisi potus ad arma prosiluit dicenda,</HI> and of the latter <HI>Martial</HI> saith,</P>
<PB N="184" REF="100">
<Q><L>Quod nintio gaudes noctem producere vino</L>
<L>Ignosco vitium forte Catonis habes.</L></Q>
<P>Howbeit this Gentleman never met with such a disgrace by such company as the Parson of <HI>Limmington</HI> had, whom our Countreyman Sir <HI>Amias Pawlet</HI> about a drunken fray set in the Stocks, and yet af|ter he proved both Arch-bishop of <HI>York,</HI> and one of the greatest Cardinals of Christendom. Neither do I bring these examples to lessen this fault, as if I were to leave some aspersion hereof upon him, my purpose is nothing lesse, for I am ra|ther of that Gentlemans mind, that ha|ving by Fatherly indulgence tolerated the humour of gaming and wenching in his Sonne, disinherited him for drinking, saying of the first, if he had wit he would not lose much by it: of the second, that in time for his own ease he would leave it; but of the third he said, he would prove the elder the viler, and hardly e|ver amend it. Now therefore that I have show'd you how this Bishop was in dan|ger by this fault, let me also showe how he was freed from it. Being once a|gainst preparing, as well himself as others
<PB N="185" REF="100">
for receiving the holy Communion, and making choice of a discreet Confessor, before whom he might powre out his soul, a custom as pittifully abused in those dayes, as disused in these, he decla|red to him by the way this disposition of his to company and drinking. The Preacher like a true spirituall Father in|deed, no less&punc; learnedly then zealously, laying before him the enormity of such a Custom, did earnestly dehort him from it, affirming to him, that though every particular excess in that kind, did not reach to a habit, or height of mortall sin, as one act of Adultery, murder, or false witness doth, yet if it should grow to a habit, it were not onely an ugly scandall in that profession, but would draw also as bad sins as it self with it. Behold a comfortable example, how where nature is weak, grace can strengthen it; upon this grave admonition, he left first the vice, and after the Company, and following his study more industriously then before at the University, he ascended worthily the degrees of Doctor and Deane, and Bishop and Arch-bishop, and lived all his life not onely continent, but abstinent: of his continence, my Authour hath said

sufficient, of his abstinency this may be one proofe, that being sickly toward his end, he was so fearfull to drinke Wine though his stomacke required it, that his Physician being a pleasant man, and loving a cup of Wine himselfe very well, was wont to fay to him sometimes, now if your Grace will call for a cup of Wine and drinke to me, I warrant it will never hurt you.</P>

<P>I no sooner remember this famous and worthy Prelate, but me thinks I see him in the Chappel at White-Hall, Queen <HI>Eliza|beth</HI> at the window in the Closset, all the Lords of the Parliament spirituall and temporall about them, and then after his three courtsies that I heare him out of the Pulpit thundring this Text: <HI>The King|domes of the Earth are mine, and I doe give them to whom I will, and I have given them to</HI> Nebuchodonozor <HI>and his son, and his sons son:</HI> which Text, when he had thus produced, taking the sense rather then words of the Prophet, there followed first so generall a murmur of one friend whis|pering to another, then such an erected
<PB N="187" REF="102">
countenance in those that had none to speake to, lastly so quiet a silence and at|tention in expectance of some strange Doctrine, where Text it selfe gave away Kingdomes and Scepters, as I have never observed either before or since. But he, as if he had been a <HI>Jeremiah</HI> himselfe, and not an expounder of him, shewed how there were two speciall causes of transla|ting of Kingdomes, the fulnesse of time and the ripenesse of sinne, that by either of these, and sometime by both, God in se|cret and just judgments transferred Scep|ters from kindred to kindred, from Nati|on to Nation at his good will and plea|sure, &amp; running over historically the great Monarchies of the world, as the King|dome of <HI>Egypt</HI> and after of <HI>Israel</HI> swallo|wed up by the <HI>Assirians,</HI> and the golden head of <HI>Nabuchodonozor,</HI> the same head cut off by the silver brest and armes of the <HI>Medes.</HI> and <HI>Perfians. Cyrus</HI> and <HI>Darius</HI> this silver consumed by the brazen belly, and this of the Graecians and <HI>Alexander,</HI> and that brasse stamped to powder by the Iron legges of the Romans and <HI>Caesar.</HI> Then coming neerer home, he shewed how oft our Nation had been a prey to forreiners, as first when we were all Brittans subdued
<PB N="188" REF="103">
by these Romans, then, when the fulnesse of time and ripenesse of our finne requi|red it, subdued by the Saxons, after this a long time prosecuted and spoyled by the Danes, finally conquered and reduced to perfect subjection by the Normans whose posterity&punc; continued in great prosperity till the days of her Majesty, who for peace, for plenty, for glory, for continuance, had exceeded them all, that had lived to change all her Councellours but one, all officers twice or thrice, some Bishops foure times, onely the uncertainty of succession gave hopes to Forreiners to attempt fresh inva|sions and breed feares in many of her Sub|jects of new Conquest, the onely way then said he that is in pollicy left to quase those hopes and to asswage these feares were to establish the succession. He noted that <HI>Nero</HI> was specially hated for wishing to have no Successor, that even <HI>Augustus</HI> was the worse beloved for appointing an ill man to his Successor, and at last insi|nuating as farre as he durst the neernesse of bloud of our present Soveraigne, he said plainly, that the expectations and pre|sages of all writers went Northward, na|ming without any circumlocution <HI>Scot|land,</HI> which said he, if it prove an errour,
<PB N="189" REF="103">
yet will it be found a learned errour. When he had finished this Sermon there was no man that knew Q. <HI>Elizabeths</HI> dis|position, but imagined that such a speech was as welcome as salt to the eyes, or to use her own word to pin up her winding sheet before her face, so to point out her Successor and urge her to declare him, wherefore we all expected that she would not onely have been highly offended, but in some present speech have shewed her displeasure. It is a principle not to be despised, <HI>Qui nescit dissimulare nescit reg|nare,</HI> she considered perhaps the extraor|dinary auditory, she supposed many of them were of his opinion, she might sus|spect some of them had perswaded him to this motion, finally she ascribed so much to his yeares, to his place, to his learning, that when she opened the window we found ourselves all deceived; for very kindly and calmly without shew of of|fence (as if she had but waked out of some sleepe) she gave him thanks for his very learned Sermon. Yet when she had better confidered the matter, and recollected her selfe in private, she sent two Councellours to him with a sharp message, to which he was glad to give a patient answer. But in
<PB N="190" REF="104">
this time that the Lords and Knights of Parliament and others were full of this Sermon, a great Peere of the Realme that was then newly recovered of an impedi|ment in his hearing (I would he did heare no worse now) being in great liking of the Archbishop for this Sermon, prayed me to prove my credit with his Grace to get a Copy thereof, and to use his name if need were, alledging that impediment which caused though he were present, that he carried away little of it, I did so and withall told how my selfe had stood so incommodiously by meanes of the great presse, as I heard it not well, but was faine to take much of it on trust on others mens reports, who varyed so, as some I was sure did him wrong. The Archbishop wel|com'd me very kindly, and made me sit with him a pretty while in his Lodging, but in fine he told me plainly he durst give no Copy, for that Sir <HI>John Fortescue</HI> and Sir <HI>John Wolley</HI> (as I remember had beene with him before from the Queene with such a greeting as he scant knew if he were a prisoner or a free man, and that the speech being already ill taken, the writing might exasperate that which al|ready was exulcerate so he denyed my

Till afterward the Lord <HI>Burleigh</HI> now Earle of <HI>Exeter,</HI> of whose courage fidelity and religious heart the Queen had great assurance, was made the Lord President.</P>
<P>But to returne to this Archbishop; as he was in place, so was he in learning, and es|pecially in reading, not second to any in his time, insomuch as in <HI>Cambridge</HI> long since, he was one of the chosen disputants before the Queen, and a Jesuit 26. yeares since disgracing our English students, as neglecting and not reading the fathers, excepts this <HI>Matthew Hutton,</HI> and one fa|mous <HI>Matthew</HI> more, and of this <HI>Hutton</HI> he saith, <HI>Qui unus in paucis versare patres dicitur,</HI> who is one of those few that searcheth the fathers: for matters of the world I can say but that that is known to the world; his eldest sonne is a Knight of faire living, and now or lately Sheriffe of <HI>Yorkeshire,</HI> and a man of very good repu|tation.

One other Sonne he had, that had an ill life, brought to a worse end, his name was <HI>Luke Hutton,</HI> so valiant that he feared not men nor Laws, and for a rob|bery done on St. <HI>Lukes</HI> day, for names sake he died as bad a death, I hope with a better mind then the Theef, of whom St. <HI>Luke</HI> writes, that he bad our Saviour, if he were Christ to save himself and him. The Arch-bishop herein show'd the constancy and severity worthy of his place; for he would not endeavour to save him (as the world thought he easily might) deserving herein the praise of Ju|stice, which <HI>Eli</HI> wanted, that was too in|dulgent of his Sonnes voices, and having hereby no blot, but such as may sort him with the great Monark of this last age, King <HI>Philip,</HI> with two famous Warriors of the old <HI>Romans, Manlius</HI> and <HI>Brutus,</HI> and with the highest Priest even <HI>Aaron.</HI> His own death was more happy then his life, to die <HI>Satur annorum,</HI> full of years, and to see and leave peace upon <HI>Israel.</HI></P>

and joyed most in his friendship and company in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and in remem|brance of it, since they were sundred, was Doctor <HI>Eedes,</HI> late Dean of <HI>Worcester,</HI> one whose company I loved, as well as he loved his <HI>Thoby Matthew.</HI> He for their farewell, upon his remove to <HI>Durham,</HI> in|tending first to go with him from <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> but one dayes Journey, was so be|trayed by the sweetness of his Company, and their old friendship, that he not one|ly brought him to <HI>Durham;</HI> but for a pleasant penance wrote their whole Journey in Latine verse, which Poem himself gave to me, and told me so many pretty Apophthegmes of theirs in their younger years, as might make a Book al|most by it self. And because I wrote onely for your Highness pleasure, I will hazard my Lords displeasure to repeat one or two of his, of one two hundred, that Doctor <HI>Eedes</HI> when he lived, could remember, being Vice-chancellor in <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> some slight matters &amp; men coming before him, one was very importunate to have them stay for his Councel: who is of your Councel saith the Vice-Chancellor, (saith he) Mr. <HI>Leasteed,</HI> alas said the Vice-Chancellor, no man can stand you in less
<PB N="198" REF="108">
stead, no remedy saith the other, necessi|ty hath no Law. Indeed quoth he, no more I think hath your Councellor. In a like ruatter another was to be bound in a bond very like to be forfeited, and came in hast to offer it, saying he would be bound if he might be taken, yes saith he, I think you will be taken, what's your name, Cox saith the party, and so prest as the manner is to come into the Court, make him more room there said he, let Coxcome in. Such facetious passages as these that are as delightfull to the hearer, as a fair course at tilt is to the beholders, where the staffe breaks both at the point, and counterbuffe even to the hand, such I say a man might collect a volum of, not at the second hand but at the first, that had been so much in his company, and so oft at his board as I have been, but that I must keep good manners, remembring the Greek Proverb, <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Odi memorem compotorem.</HI> And if your Highness had a fancy to hear more of them, Mr. Doctor <HI>Dromond</HI> can as well relate them as my self, both of us having met in his graces dish sometimes, and ta|sted of this sawce. Yet this kind of plea|santness that I repeat as one of his pray|ses,
<PB N="199" REF="108">
himself will most seriously check in himself, sometime as his fault and infir|mity, which he confesses he is inforced to use, sometime as a recreation of his wea|ried spirits, after more painfull and seri|ous studies, and though in these conceits, the wit might seem to labour, as much as in these gravest, and had need to carry as it were, a good bent to send them so smartly as they come from him ordinari|ly: yet methinks it may be fitly compa|red to a bow that will endure bending the contrary way, and thereby come to cast the better in his right bent, or by a more homly comparison, to a true and tough Laborer in our Countrey, that ha|ving sweat at hard labour all the week, asketh no better refreshing, then to sweat as fast with dancing about the May-pole, or running at Base, or wrestling upon the Holiday. Wherefore let himself call it his fault, as I have heard him oft, and say he knows such nugacity be|comes not his place, and lament that nature and custom have so fram'd him, that when he ceases to be plea|sant at his meat, he must cease to be; for my part, I' speak frankly, I will love this fault in him, if it be a fault, and
<PB N="200" REF="109">
be glad if I can follow it, having learnt an old rule of my mother in law, <HI>At meat be glad, for sin be sad;</HI> and I will say here|after for my selfe,</P>
<Q><L>Haud metuam si jam nequeo defendere cri|men</L>
<L>Cum tanto commune viro.</L></Q>
<P>Or, as upon no unlike occasion, I wrote ten yeers since to Dr. <HI>Eeds.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Though M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">s love mens lines and lives to scanne,</L>
<L>He saith he thinks me no dishonest man;</L>
<L>Yet one great fault of mine he oft rehearses,</L>
<L>Which is, I am too full of Toyes and Uerses:</L>
<L>True <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> true it is, my fault I grant;</L>
<L>Yet when thou shalt thy greatest vertues vaunt,</L>
<L>I know some worthy spirits one might entice</L>
<L>To leave that greatest vertue for this Uice.</L></Q>
<P>But if any wil be so Stoicall, as to make this confession of my Lords grace (which is indeed of grace) to serve them for an accusation, to give him thereby the nick-name of <HI>Nugax,</HI> given 500 yeers past to <HI>Radulphus</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and successour of the great <HI>Anselme,</HI> as is no|ted in the Catalogue <HI>p.</HI> 38. I should think them unjust and undiscreet to stir up new emulation between <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>Yorke;</HI> but rather I might compare him with one
<PB N="201" REF="109">
of his own predecessors in <HI>Durham, Cuth|bert Tunstall,</HI> p. 532. of the same book, well worth the reading and remembring. In the mean time let me lay their censo|rious mood with this verse.</P>
<Q><L>Qui sic nug atur tractantem ut seria vincat,</L>
<L>Hic tractaturus seria quantus erat.</L></Q>
<P>But to draw to an end, I will tell one act of his of double piety, done not long since. He made a journey, accompanied with a Troop, fit for his calling, to <HI>Bristol,</HI> to see his mother, who was then living, but not able to travel to him; after much kindnesse shewed to her, and much boun|ty to the City, he went to visit his other mother of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and comming neer the Town with that troop of his retinue, and friends to the water, it came into his mind how that time 40 yeer, or more, he past the same water, as a young poor scholler, going to <HI>Oxford,</HI> remembring <HI>Jacobs</HI> words, <HI>In baculo meo transivi Jor|danem istum, &amp;c.</HI> with my staffe I passed over this <HI>Jordan,</HI> and now I passe over a|gain with these troups, he was so moved therewith, that he alighted from his hors, and going apart, with devout tears of joy and thankfulnesse, he kneeled down and used some like words.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="110">
It may seem pity that a man of so sweet and milde disposition should have any crosse, but he that sends them knowes what is best for his. He hath had one great domesticall crosse, though he beares it wisely, not in his wife, for she is the best reported and reputed of her sort I thinke in <HI>England,</HI> and they live together by St. <HI>Pauls</HI> rule. <HI>Uientes hoc seculo.</HI></P>
<P>But I meane such a crosse as <HI>David</HI> had in his sonne <HI>Absalom,</HI> for though he gave both consent and commission to prosecute him, yet nature overcame displeasure, and forced him to cry, <HI>Absalom my son, my son, I would I might suffer for thee or in thy stead my son, my son.</HI> For indeed this son of his whom he and his friends gave over for lost, yea worse then lost, was likely for learning, for memory, for sharpnesse of wit and sweetnesse of behaviour to have pro|ved another <HI>Thoby Matthew,</HI> neither is his case so desperate, but that if he would belief <HI>Matthew</HI> better then <HI>Thoby,</HI> I would thinke yet there were hope to reclaime him.</P>

<P>It is noted of <HI>Dionysius</HI> of <HI>Sicily</HI> that he had no care of any religion that was pro|fessed in his country, as neither had his father before him, making but a sport to robbe their Gods, taking away <HI>Aesculapi|us</HI> Beard of Gold, because his father <HI>Apollo</HI> had no Beard, and <HI>Jupiters</HI> golden Cloake saying that it was too heavy for Sommer and too cold for Winter, yet used he to conferre sometimes with Philosophers, and have the choysest of them and give them honourable entertainment, which honour at last bred him this commodity, that losing his Crowne hee learned to beare poverty not onely without dismay but with some disport. The like I may say of a late great Earle of this Realme, Son of a great Duke, who though he made no great conscience to spoyle the Church livings no more then did his fa|ther, yet for his reputation and perhaps for his recreation, he would have some choyce and excellent men for his Chap|laines
<PB N="204" REF="111">
of both Universities, as Doctor <HI>Thoby Matthew</HI> now Archbishop of <HI>Yorke,</HI> Doctor <HI>John Still</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> and this Prelate that I am now to speake of Doctor <HI>James</HI> then Deane of <HI>Christchurch</HI> and this hope of comfort came to his Lordship thereby, that if it pleased God to impart any mercy to him (as his mercy endureth for ever) it was by the speciall Ministery of this man, who was the last of his Coat that was with him in his sicknesse. Concerning this Bishop|rick it is formerly noted by mine Author, that it was once dissolved by Act of Par|liament in the Minority of King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, what time the two new Dukes of <HI>Sommerset</HI> and <HI>Northumberland</HI> like the Souldiers that cast lots for Christs gar|ment divided between them <HI>Patrimonium Crucifixi,</HI> namely, the two good Bishop|ricks of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Durham,</HI> one being de|signed as a seat for the Western Duke, the other for the Northern; and whereas by an old Metamorphofis the Bishop of <HI>Dur|ham</HI> had been Earle of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> now by a new <HI>Apotheosis</HI> the Duke of <HI>Nor|thumberland</HI> would have beene Bishop of <HI>Durham:</HI> But <HI>qui despexit de coelo deribe|dat eos.</HI> That visible hand that wrote in
<PB N="205" REF="111">
the wall while <HI>Balthasar</HI> was quaffing in the holy Vessels, that hand though invisi|ble weighed these petty Monarks in the ballance of Gods judgements, found them too light; and because they should not grow too long, they were both cut shor|ter by the head: the Bishopricks restored to what they now are by Queene <HI>Mary,</HI> one being in substance, the other by acci|dent of leaden Mines, two of the best Bi|shopricks of <HI>England,</HI> and as worthy Bi|shops they have had, especially these two of them, namely two <HI>Matthews</HI> are spoken of in the Title of <HI>Yorke.</HI> There remaines now this third, who having had yet scant a yeare and a day as they say, I have the lesse to speake of as of a Bishop. But that examining by the infallible square set downe by St. <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy</HI> chap. 3. for choyce of a Bishop he will be found as worthily chosen as any: For his Lear|ning it may be sufficient to say he was Deane of <HI>Christchurch,</HI> which as I have said formerly attaines not to but choyce men, and there are sermons of his extant in Print that testifie no lesse. For hospi|tality which is a speciall praise of a Bi|shop, he shewed in <HI>Oxford</HI> his disposition thereto in that lesse hability, and for both
<PB N="206" REF="112">
at once at the comming of divers great States, and lastly fifteen yeares past of the Queen her self before whom he preached, and to whom he gave so good entertain|ment, as her Majesty commended the or|der and manner of it long after; which commendation of well setting out and ordering a feaft, I should have thought of the lesse moment, if I did not finde in <HI>Plu|tarke</HI> in the life of <HI>Paulus Aemylius</HI> a great Captain and Conquerour, and otherwise a man of much vertue and temperance, the well ordering of a feast to be esteemed not one of his least commendations. But I will conclude with a greater and more worthy commendation; and which I could wish, as it is exemplar, so it might be followed by all ensuing Bishops. For whereas <HI>Durham</HI> house had been granted to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> only during her life, when few thought that such a house would have proved too little for her e|state. It fortuned after she was Queen this house to be neglected according to the proverbe not unfit to be applyed to his Learning that first built it: <HI>Praestat esse ca|put asini quam cauda leonis.</HI> Among other roomes the Chappell was not onely pro|phaned but even defaced This good Bi|shop
<PB N="207" REF="112">
the first thing he doth at his com|ming repaires this Chappell, and and fur|nisheth it within in comely and costly sort; for which good mind and act, I doubt not but God wil build him a house, toward which he shall ever have my best wishes.</P>

<HEAD>and the Bishop Dr. <HI>Henry Robinson.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis Bishopricke, as my Author hath touched page 540. and 543. hath beene so fortunate to have yeilded two singular examples of fidelity and loyalty of Prelats to their Soveraigne, one of es|peciall marke worthy to be cannonized with the Patron of <HI>Venice.</HI> St. <HI>Marke</HI> was also named <HI>Merks</HI> commended here by my Author, and no lesse worthily extolled by Mr. <HI>Samuel Daniel,</HI> in his excellent Poem of the civill Warres of <HI>Lancaster</HI> and <HI>Yorke.</HI> The other was Bishop <HI>Ogle|thorpe,</HI> who when all the Bishops of <HI>Eng|land</HI> refused to Crowne <HI>Elizabeth</HI> because of her Religion, yet he being himselfe of a contrary Religion performed it, neither
<PB N="208" REF="113">
of these received their reward in this world that they were worthy. <HI>Merks</HI> be|ing removed from <HI>Carlile</HI> to <HI>Samos</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> viz. out of Gods blessing into a warme sunne as the saying is, <HI>Oglethorpe</HI> enduring deprivation because even at the Coronation he would not omit the cere|mony of elevation, howbeit it is supposed if he had not so suddenly after dyed of the griefe, her Majesty would have had some speciall respect of him above all fel|lowes, which I speake not upon meere conjecture, but upon some speech of her Majesty used to the present Bishop that now is, for when shee received his ho|mage, she gave many gracious words to him of her good opinion, for his learning integrity, and sufficiency to the place, concluding that she must ever have a care to furnish that place with a worthy man; for his sake said she that set my Crowne first on my head, and many words to like effect, as the Bishop himselfe hath partly told me. He seemes a man of great gravi|ty, and temperance very mild in his speech, but not of so strong a constitution of body as his countenance doth promise; but having seen his Sea never, and himself

<P>OF this new Bishopricke, and new Lord Bishop also I have very little to say, and I need say the lesse, because your Highnesse hath heard him Preach often, and very well; I call him a new Lord Bishop, because though he were a Bishop before, yet was he not thereby a Lord of the Parliament House; howbeit his Title before sounded to the vulgar ears more universall then either <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Constanti|nople,</HI> namely Bishop of <HI>Man:</HI> but from thence he was translated to <HI>Chester</HI> the chiefe City of that Shire, that some call chiefe of men, which Shire having a spe|ciall temporall blessing (to abound) not with milke and honey, as the Land of <HI>Pro|mise,</HI> but with milke and salt, a matter more necessary in sacrifice; I wish it may also flow in spirituall blessings, and doubt not but that by the irrigation rather then inundation of this Floud they shall en|crease
<PB N="210" REF="114">
in them, and as our Saviour com|mands to joyne peace with salt, and espe|cially I wish that blessing to their Neigh|bours beyond the salt water, I meane in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who though they have milk, and are so weake in faith they cannot yet di|gest hard meat, yet for want of this salt and peace, they make many goe of Pilgri|mage to <HI>Westchester</HI> against their wills from both Realmes, some of whom the Bishop of <HI>Chester</HI> was wont to entertaine in kinde sort, as my selfe can testifie, and this Bishop I heare doth herein succeed also his worthy Predecessor Doctor <HI>Vau|ghan.</HI></P>

<CLOSER>THus have you, <SALUTE>most highly esteemed and most entirely beloved Prince,</SALUTE> this un|worthy supply of mine to the worthy worke of a more worthy man. It is growne in|to greater length then I expected, by reason I tooke some kinde of pleasure with the paine of writing hereof, supposing I was all the while telling a story as it were in your High|nesse presence and hearing. Now if any that favour not the persons I write of, nor the pur|pose I write for, happen to sport at this my fashion of writing to your Highnesse, as<HI> Ti|granes </HI>jested at<HI> Lucullus </HI>Army, saying, if

he came as an Embassadour his Traine was to great, if as a Warrier, his Troop was too small.
