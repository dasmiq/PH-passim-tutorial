Lieutenant-General
TOLMACH.</HEAD>
<LG N="1">
<L>SINCE Heav'n, from <HI>Albion</HI>'s once lov'd Isle estrang'd,</L>
<L>Has into frowns its benign Aspect chang'd;</L>
<L>And pleas'd to interrupt her joys,</L>
<L>The blessings she in her great <HI>Tolmach</HI> found,</L>
<L>With which her Fields, while grac'd with him, were crown'd,</L>
<L>Severely in their Author them destroys,</L>
<L>And in her tenderest part gives her a Mortal Wound:</L>
<L>Why, in this great occasion to complain</L>
<L>Does <HI>Albion</HI> seem insensible?</L>
<L>O why suppress her Sighs, her Tears restrain?</L>
<L>Nor offer at her Patron's Herse</L>
<L>A Sacrifice of Monumental Verse?</L>
<L>That might her grief great as her suff'rings tell;</L>
<L>And Celebrate the mighty name</L>
<L>That swells the Registrys of Fame,</L>
<L>That Name, whose just Applause is the main source of hers?</L>

<L>Rouze, you ungrateful Scribling Crew;</L>
<L>Who with your tribute of gross flatteries come</L>
<L>To wait on every meaner Tomb,</L>
<L>But where you shou'd be loudest-tongu'd, are Dumb;</L>
<L>Think what is to the name of <HI>Tolmach</HI> due;</L>
<L>Of whom the wonders you declare</L>
<L>So far from Adulation will appear,</L>
<L>They cannot reach his glorious Character.</L>
<L>Justly to him your praise belongs,</L>
<L>Whose great exploits gave you a copious theme,</L>
<L>And did inspire each Muse with thoughts sublime,</L>
<L>In imitation of them,</L>
<L>But still, alas! inferiour to him,</L>
<L>The noblest Subject; and the best rewarder of your Songs&punc;</L>
<L>For as his Virtue did exalt your strains</L>
<L>Above the pitch of Common thought and sense,</L>
<L>He amply did requite your pains</L>
<L>By his unparalel'd Munificence;</L>
<L>He made your Laurels fructifie,</L>
<L>And rais'd you to the heights of Poetry,</L>
<L>Freed from the pressure of its Indigence.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>Raise then your Voices, and his Praise declare,</L>
<L>Thus to the World you will your Verse endear,</L>
<L>And ravish every list'ning Ear.</L>
<L>Tell of his Noble Aspect, graceful Mein,</L>
<L>In which beholders took a strange content,</L>
<L>Fitted to hold the glorious Things within,</L>
<L>And what it did contain, to represent.</L>
<L>There Wit and Sense were in abundance found;</L>
<L>But least, as Waters that their Banks o'erflow,</L>
<L>These streams shou'd shallow by dilation grow,</L>
<L>A solid Judgment did their courses bound,</L>
<L>Which still preserv'd their Depth and Current too,</L>
<L>And made their Silence as themselves, profound;</L>
<L>Not noisie with impertinence,</L>
<L>The certain mark of a low Ebb of Sense.</L>

<L>Nor did his Courage to his Wit give place;</L>
<L>As great, and yet as quiet too it was;</L>
<L>Free from all offers of offence,</L>
<L>Conceal'd within his Breast it lay,</L>
<L>As Seeds of Fire hid in their Parent Stone,</L>
<L>Nor easily wou'd it be tempted thence,</L>
<L>Till urg'd by Provocation,</L>
<L>The angry Sparks forc'd thence their burning way,</L>
<L>And made his real Brav'ry known,</L>
<L>That cou'd resent a wrong as well as ofter none.</L>
<L>But if his Country, dear as Life or Fame,</L>
<L>Bid him unsheath his Sword in its defence,</L>
<L>His Blood was quickly in a flame,</L>
<L>And in each Vein beat brisk alarms,</L>
<L>To call her great Defender out to Arms;</L>
<L>Such for her weakness was his shame,</L>
<L>Such of her Suff'rings was his tender Sense.</L>

<L><HI>Hibernia,</HI> that unhappy Land</L>
<L>That boasts her wholsome Soil no Venom breeds,</L>
<L>Yet never wants Rebellion's poys'nous Seeds,</L>
<L>Her Empress <HI>Albion</HI> durst withstand,</L>
<L>And strove to wrest the Scepter from her Hand;</L>
<L>Who then so fit in <HI>Albion</HI>'s Cause to Fight,</L>
<L>As he who did in <HI>Albion</HI>'s Peace delight:</L>
<L>And was the great Asserter of her Right?</L>
<L><HI>Tolmach</HI> is sent her Vassals to reduce;</L>
<L><HI>Tolmach</HI> the Brave, who cou'd not brook to see</L>
<L>An Arbitrary Pow'r her Laws abuse,</L>
<L>And cramp her Native Liberty:</L>
<L>Him she desires, him she's oblig'd to choose;</L>
<L>Nor cou'd she find, in her Heroick Store,</L>
<L>One that wou'd study her Advantage more,</L>
<L>Or in her Cause be more of Life profuse.</L>

<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L><HI>Athlone,</HI> by Art and Nature Fortified,</L>
<L>Put a strange Non-plus to the <HI>English</HI> Arms,</L>
<L>Their Courage baffled, and their strength defied,</L>
<L>Doubly secur'd from Harms,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4">
Till <HI>Tolmach</HI> found away they did not dread,</L>
<L>(Since such a dangerous Enterprise</L>
<L>No Courage durst attempt, no Thought design, but his)</L>
<L>A way as unsuspected as unknown,</L>
<L>At once to gain their River and their Town;</L>
<L>Follow'd by Numbers of admiring Friends</L>
<L>(Who wou'd not follow where he led?)</L>
<L>Into the <HI>Shannon</HI> boldly he descends,</L>
<L>As <HI>Caesar</HI> once into the <HI>Rubicon;</HI></L>
<L>Th'affrighted River from him fled,</L>
<L>Quitted its Post, and did to <HI>Lym'rick</HI> haste,</L>
<L>(The Rebels strongest Refuge and their last,)</L>
<L>Nor thought its Stream had now sufficient speed,</L>
<L>While to th' astonish'd Town he safely pass'd,</L>
<L>And on the conquer'd Walls his flying Ensigns plac'd.</L>
<L>Thus daring Minds no difficulty know,</L>
<L>The Courage that in great Attempts they shew,</L>
<L>Enables them to conquer what it leads them to.</L>
<L>Soon Wars loud Tumults in <HI>Hibernia</HI> cease,</L>
<L>Subjected to her Soveraigns Pow'r:</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the Blessings of his gentle Reign,</L>
<L>The Golden Plenty, and the Downy Peace,</L>
<L>Which, as his happy Conquest did restore,</L>
<L>His more triumphant goodness does encrease;</L>
<L>And now she tunes her silver Lyre again,</L>
<L>To Sing her Liberty regain'd,</L>
<L>Which, if unconquer'd, she had ne'r obtain'd,</L>
<L>Since she no longer business does afford,</L>
<L>To exercise our Heroes Sword,</L>
<L>He hastens to the <HI>Belgick</HI> shore,</L>
<L>That does his strong successful Arm implore,</L>
<L>To free it from th' encroaching <HI>Gallick</HI> Pow'r,</L>
<L>Which with the Title of <HI>Most Christian</HI> dress'd,</L>
<L>Does <HI>Christendom</HI> worse than the Turk infest.</L>

<L>But to suppress this pow'rful Foe,</L>
<L>And wound him deeper with a nearer blow,</L>
<L>The <HI>British</HI> Navy is for <HI>France</HI> design'd,</L>
<L><HI>France</HI> must again that dreaded Courage know,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="4">
That Courage that had often brought her low;</L>
<L>And whom cou'd <HI>Albion,</HI> but her <HI>Tolmach,</HI> find</L>
<L>That with more Vigour wou'd her Armies head,</L>
<L>Or one by whom they wou'd be rather led?</L>
<L>Whose dreaded name, like <HI>Talbot</HI>'s heretofore,</L>
<L>Wou'd through those Fields her Fame more largely spread,</L>
<L>And fright French Children, but their Fathers more?</L>
<L>The English Bravery in <HI>France</HI> well known</L>
<L>And own'd peculiarly Ours,</L>
<L>Which last inglorious Age out-liv'd,</L>
<L>And long lay buried with our Ancestors&punc;</L>
<L>In <HI>Tolmach</HI> was reviv'd,</L>
<L>And we th' Original must own</L>
<L>Amended and Enlarg'd in this Edition.</L>

<L>But, Oh! what Pow'r, envious at <HI>Albion</HI>'s joy,</L>
<L>Blasts her with a malignant breath,</L>
<L>And does her gawdy blooming Hopes destroy!</L>
<L>Scarce had he touch'd th' inhospitable Shore,</L>
<L>Which all around for fear began to roar;</L>
<L>When from th' Encounter of a fiery Storm</L>
<L>A swift, tho' heavy Messenger of Death</L>
<L>Too well its hateful Errand did perform</L>
<L>And forcing a remoter part</L>
<L>Made way for Fate too soon to reach his heart,</L>
<L>And boldly tell him he must be no more.</L>
<L>When this th' advancing Soldiers knew,</L>
<L>Cold as he their Courage grew,</L>
<L><HI>France</HI> had no way but this to shock them so:</L>
<L>Their General's Life is all their care,</L>
<L>Which to preserve they hastily retreat,</L>
<L>The Fate of <HI>France</HI> and their Revenge defer,</L>
<L>To wait on a concern more near and great.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>Back to his Native soil convey'd,</L>
<L>His drooping Head he on her Bosom laid,</L>
<L>And in her Service wasted, yet untir'd,</L>
<L>As fearless as he liv'd, expir'd,</L>
<L>And for the Breath she gave too largely paid.</L>
<L><HI>France</HI> by his Death already grown too proud,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5">
Wanted the honour of his grave,</L>
<L>This privilege injurious Fate allow'd</L>
<L>To be for <HI>Albion</HI> reserv'd,</L>
<L>Whom as his Life he lov'd, whom with his Life he serv'd:</L>
<L>Nor cou'd she next his Life, a greater blessing crave</L>
<L>Than to preserve him, Dead, who her, alive did save.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>See <HI>Albion,</HI> see thy General brought home,</L>
<L>Not crown'd with Conquest, as he us'd to come,</L>
<L>But by Inconstant Fate betray'd,</L>
<L>Himself a bleeding Victim made;</L>
<L>Ah then dissolve into a briny Flood,</L>
<L>And let it flow in Consort with his Blood.</L>
<L>But, Oh! The precious Balm is shed in vain,</L>
<L>No Virtue is in that or Physick found</L>
<L>To keep out death, and heal the gaping wound:</L>
<L>That Sluice does Life's whole treasure drain.</L>
<L>Not all thy Sighs can him with Breath supply,</L>
<L>Not all thy Pray'rs his fleeting Soul recal,</L>
<L>But in thy Arms thy Champion must dye,</L>
<L>Pleasing himself with what thou do'st lament,</L>
<L>The loss of Life in thy lov'd Service spent,</L>
<L>And only deems the Sacrifice too small.</L>
<L>Since then for thee, the gen'rous <HI>Tolmach</HI> dies,</L>
<L>To his great Memory just Trophies raise,</L>
<L>For which he Death may prize!</L>
<L>That his pleas'd Soul from its exalted Seat</L>
<L>May triumph in his Fate,</L>
<L>So well deserving, and so full of praise.</L>
<L>While in a peaceful Grave his Body lies,</L>
<L>The Guardian Relick of our Isle</L>
<L><HI>Berkeley</HI> in <HI>France</HI> performs his Obsequies,</L>
<L>And makes whole flaming Towns become his Fun'ral Pile.</L>
