<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THough the <HI>happiness</HI> which I formerly enjoyed in your <HI>Converse,</HI> hath been, to <HI>my</HI> great loss, for some years discon|tinued; yet I easily perswade my self, that the Favour of a <HI>Great Prince,</HI> and the <HI>Best Master</HI> in the World, has not wrought such a change upon your <HI>even Virtue,</HI> but that you will still descend to <HI>remember</HI> him whom you were once pleased to honour with the Name of <HI>Friend.</HI> This Confidence has embol|d'ned me to present you with this <HI>small

trifle</HI>; too <HI>mean</HI> indeed and <HI>trivial</HI> for your acceptance, but that I know you are wont to admit of any thing that proceeds from an <HI>honest undesigning</HI> Gra|titude.

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Shall not trouble thee, Reader, nor my self, with a long Apology for the publishing this Treatise. How demurely soever I should pretend to the contrary, I fear thou wilt still be apt to imagin, that I had a tolerable good opinion of it, before I ventur'd it to the Press; and truly I my self cann't well conceive, how any man should be over ambitious of being publickly laught at. If it be in any measure suited to the General Good, (for which I intended it,) I may at least expect thy pardon; but if upon the perusal thou shalt find it otherwise, I ingenu|ously acknowledge my self to have been mistaken. My Design in this Work is, to render the Rules of those excellent Arts, which the Title-page pretends to, so plain and obvious, as that they may be easily apprehended without the Assistance of a living Master. And if there were nothing new in the whole, but the perspicuity of the Principles, and easiness of the Method (which out of civility to my self I must deny) yet those alone are sufficient to vindicate me in this Publication; and I hope thou wilt not be angry, that I am a Well-wisher to thy Vnderstanding. For when I consider'd, that among the many good Books of this Nature, that are abroad in the
<PB REF="4">
World (though written by Persons of greater knowledge than I dare pretend to) some were so learned and obscure, as not to be understood, unless by those who have already made a considerable proficiency in these things; others, so voluminous and prolix that they fright the endeavours of such who cannot spend their whole time this way: I was willing, according to my abilities, to ob|viate both these inconveniences, and accordingly applied my self to the composure of something, which for its plainness and brevity might be ac|commodated to those of mean Capacities and small Leisure; and this Book is the result of those Contemplations. Whether I have accomplish'd my purpose or no, I make thee the Iudge; requiring only that thou censure impartially of the Author and his Endeavours, without being offended that he is desirous to do thee a courtesie. I shall not here expatiate in the praise of the Arguments I treat of, nor give thee one line of Encomium: though out of the great affection I bear to these Arts, I find a strange inclination in my self to be rhetorical, yet I am resolv'd not to affront thee; for truly their usefulness and excellency is so uni|versally known, that to tell thee of it as a new thing, were to suppose thee a Person of more than ordinary ignorance; only (as I said before) I must be so civil to my self too, as to inform thee, that (besides the <HI>Introduction</HI> to <HI>Arithmetick</HI> and the <HI>Treatise</HI> of <HI>Interest,</HI> of which I challenge no more than thou shalt find thy self very willing to give me) that Part which concerns the mea|suring
<PB REF="4">
of <HI>Solids, viz.</HI> the <HI>Prismoid, Cylindroid, &amp;c.</HI> is wholly new, and never before made publick. The bulk is bigger than at first by me intended; but to gratifie the Book-seller, the <HI>Vulgar Arith|metick</HI> was an Appendix, though previous to the rest. But if one, or other, or all, prove either profitable or pleasant to thee, I am sufficiently oblig'd to subscribe,</P>

<HEAD>THE RULE OF THREE.</HEAD>
<P>THis <HI>Rule</HI> is so called, because herein are three numbers given to find a fourth; of these three numbers, two are always to be mul|tiplied together, and their Product is to be divided by the third, and the Quotient exhibits the fourth number, or the number sought.</P>
<P>And here note, That of the three given numbers, if that number that asketh the Question be greater than that of like denomi|nation with it self, and require more, or if i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be less, and require less, then the number of like denomination is the Divisor.</P>

<P>Here you may see the term that asketh the Question is greater than that of like denomi|nation, being 3, and the other 32, and also requires more, <HI>viz.</HI> a greater number of Shil|lings; therefore, according to the Rule, the first term, or the term of like denomination to that which asketh the Question, is the Di|visor.</P>

<P>In this Question (being the Converse of the former) you may see the term that asketh the Question, here 3, is lesser than that of like de|nomination, being 32 Ells, and also requires less; therefore the first term here also is the Divisor.</P>

<P>A Fraction or broken Number is always less than a Unite, as Pence are parts of a Shilling, and Shillings of a Pound, Inches of a Foot, and Minutes of an Hour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>A <HI>vulgar</HI> Fraction is commonly expressed by two Numbers set over one another, with a small line between them, after this manner &frac23;, the uppermost being called the Numerator, and the lower the Denominator.</P>
<P>The Denominator expresseth into how many parts the Integer or whole Number is divided, and the Numerator sheweth how many of those parts is contained in the Fraction.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>If the Integer be a Shilling &frac23; is 8 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>If it be 1 <HI>l.</HI> or 20 Shillings, it is 13 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>If a Foot, it is then 8 Inches.</P>
<P>Or if an Hour, it will be 40 Minutes.</P>
<P>A <HI>decimal</HI> Fraction hath always a common Number for a Numerator, and a <HI>decimal</HI> Number for its Denominator.</P>
<P>A <HI>decimal</HI> Number is known by Unity, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h
<PB N="36" REF="27">
one or more Cyphers standing before it, as 10, 100, 1000, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>decimal</HI> Fraction is known from a whole Number by a point, or some other small mark of distinction, whether it stand alone, or be joyn'd with whole Numbers; as in these fol|lowing Examples.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>Or else with a point over the head of Unity, or the Unite place; as in these Examples.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>In <HI>decimal</HI> Fractions, the Numerators only are set down, the Denominator being known by the last Figure in the Numerator.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>.2 is Two tenths.</P>
<P>.25 is Twenty five Hundredths.</P>
<P>.257 is Thousandths.</P>
<P>.2575 is Ten Thousandths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As Cyphers before a whole Number have no value, so Cyphers after a <HI>decimal</HI> Fraction are of no signification: But Cyphers before a <HI>decimal</HI> Fraction, are of special regard; for
<PB N="37" REF="27">
as Cyphers after a whole Number do increase that Number, so before a <HI>decimal</HI> Fraction they diminish the value of that Fraction.</P>

<HEAD>DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DIvision,</HI> both in whole Numbers and Fra|ctions, is by young Practitioners found to be more difficult than any of the four Species; it will therefore require a little more industry in the Learner: But when once had, there will appear small difference between the Operation herein, as in any the precedent.</P>
<P><HI>Division</HI> is also constituted by three Requi|sites, and a fourth by accident, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Divi|dend,</HI> a <HI>Divisor,</HI> and a <HI>Quotient:</HI> The fourth is a <HI>Remainder,</HI> which doth not always happen to be.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dividend</HI> is the Number to be divided.</P>
<P>The <HI>Divisor</HI> is the Number by which the other is to be divided.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quotient</HI> is the Number found out by the Division.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Remainder</HI> is that which is left of the Dividend after the Division is ended, and is always less than the Divisor.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>If 12 be to be divided by 4, then is 12 the Dividend, 4 the Divisor, and the Quotient will be 3.</P>
<P>If 13 be divided by 3, then 13 is the Divi|dend, 3 the Divisor, 4 the Quotient, and there will be a Remain, which is here 1.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="30">Decimal Fractions, or mixt Numbers, are divided after the same manner as whole Num|bers are divided, only care must be had in gi|ving a true value to the Quotient. To perform which, observe well this General Rule.</P>
<P><HI>The first Figure in the Quotient is always of the same denomination with that Figure which stands (or is supposed to stand) over the Unity place in the Divisor.</HI></P>
<P>As to the manner of placing your Figures, and the way of dividing, there are many pub|lished by divers Writers of <HI>Arithmetick:</HI> The way of placing the Divisor under the Dividend, is the most apt for giving a value to the Quo|tient; but the rasing of Figures, and repeating the Divisor so often, is found an inconvenience; which to avoid, observe the following Ex|amples.</P>
<P>Being to divide 2487.04 by 53.6, I place them in this order:
53.6 ) 2487.048 (</P>
<P>Then I consider if the Divisor were placed under the Dividend, the Unity place in the Divisor, here 3 would stand under the 8 in the Dividend, I then set a mark over the head of the 8, and conclude the first Figure in the Quotient to be of the same denomination with it, which is Tens, in whole Numbers.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="30"><GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>Having thus found the value of the first Fi|gure in the Quotient, I proceed to the division, and inquire, how many times 5 in 24? I find 4; I then set 4 in the Quotient, and go back, multiplying the whole Divisor by that Figure, and subduct the Product out of the Dividend, placing the Remainder underneath as part of a new Dividend: Thus 4 times 6 is 24, from 27, and there remains 3, which I place under the 7; again, 4 times 3 is 12, and 2 that I borrow|ed is 14, from 18, and there remains 4, which I place under the 8, as in the Example; then 4 times 5 is 20, and 1 I borrowed is 21, from 24, and there remains 3, which I place under the 4. For my new Dividend, I bring down the next Figure, here a Cypher, and post|pone it to the Remainder, and the Example will stand thus:
<GAP DESC="math"></P>
<P>Then proceeding in my Division, I ask, how many times 5 in 34? finding 6 times, I then place 6 in the Quotient, and as before say, 6 times 6 is 36, from 40, and there remains 4, which I set down under the Cypher; then 6 times 3 is 18, and 4 I borrowed is 22, from 23,
<PB N="44" REF="31">
and there remains 1, which I place under the 3; then 6 times 5 is 30, and 2 I borrowed is 32, from 34, and there will remain 2, which I place under the 4; then to this Remainder I bring down the next Figure in the Dividend, postponing it as I did the Cypher, and they will stand thus:

<P>Having placed a Cypher in the Quotient, I add another to the Dividend, and make it 800; and then inquire, how many times 5 in 8? finding once, I put 1 in the Quotient, working as before: Where note, So long as there is a Remainder, if you add Cyphers and work after this manner, you may have as many Decimals as you please.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="31">It doth often happen in Division, in decimal Fractions, or mixt Numbers, that the Unite place in the Divisor will stand beyond all the significant Figures in the Dividend, either to|ward the right hand or toward the left; in which case, that you may the better find out the value of the first Figure in your Quotient (according to the precedent General Rule) add Cyphers to the right or to the left hand of the Dividend, till you come over the Unity place in the Divisor, and what value or denomination that place is of, that is the denomination of the first Figure in the quote; as in these</P>

<P>Of the five Numbers given, the question is sometimes annexed to two, and sometimes but to one.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="40">If the question be annexed to two of the five given Numbers, then are there two of the other three of the same <HI>species</HI> with those that ask the question, and the third is proportional to the Number sought.</P>
<P>For the due regulation of these two Calcula|tions, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the question is annexed to two of the five Numbers, take these Directions.</P>
<P>First, take one of the Numbers demanding, and let that ask the question in the first opera|tion; secondly, take that of the same <HI>species,</HI> and also that of the like quality with the re|spondent, of these three constitute your first Rule of Proportion; then find which is your Divisor, according to your Rule <HI>pag.</HI> 55. and proceed to find the fourth in proportion.</P>
<P>Then for your second <HI>Rule of Three,</HI> take the other of the two Numbers to which the question is annexed, and let that ask the question; take also the Number of like kind, and the fourth Num|ber found in the first Calculation; judge which is your Divisor, and work accordingly; the last Quotient will be the sixth Number, or the Num|ber sought.</P>

<P>THe Corner-stone in the whole Fabrick of Cask-Gauging, as full, was long since laid by Mr. <HI>Oughtred,</HI> taking a Cask to be the Frustum of a Sphe|roid, under which capacity they are generally received, though indeed there have been, and daily are found some Cask differing in form, and really are more Parabolical than Spheroidal, I shall therefore lay down a plain Method for the performance of the Work (<HI>viz.</HI> finding their Content) under these four Considerations:
<LIST>
<ITEM>As Spheroidal,</ITEM>
<ITEM>As The Frustum of a Parabolical Spindle,</ITEM>
<ITEM>As The Frustum of a Parabolical Conoid,</ITEM>
<ITEM>As The Frustums of two Cones abutting upon one common Base.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<PB N="192" REF="105">
These severally, with and without a Table of Area's of Circles.</P>
<P>And forasmuch as the Dimensions must be the first thing known, before the Content can be found, I shall therefore shew the young Tyro, how by some of the Dimensions to find the rest, if any obstruction prohibit the taking of all.</P>
<P><HI>The Boung-diameter, and Head-diameter, and Diagonal, to find the Casks length.</HI></P>
<P>First subduct the semi-difference of Diame|ters from the Boung-diameter, and Square the Remainder, which Square subduct from the Square of the Diagonal, and the Remainder is the Square of the Casks semi-length.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>Let BD be the Boung-diameter = 29 Inches,</P>
<P>HE be the Head-diameter = 23 Inches,</P>
<P>BE be the Diagonal = 35.3836&gt;Inches,</P>
<P>SD the semi-difference = 3 Inches:</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> the Length = LT?</P>

<P><PB N="193" REF="105"><HI>The Boung-diameter, Diagonal, and Length, to find the Head-diameter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Rule.</HI></P>
<P>From the quadrupled Square of the Diagonal subduct the Square of the Length, (which done) the Square Root of the Remainder is equal to the Sum of the Boung-diameter and one Head-diameter.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>

<P>For finding the Capacity of these, or any other Vessels, it is convenient to have always in readiness a Table of Area's of Circles in Wine and Ale Gallons: I think it unnecessary to swell this intended small Volume with them, there being two lately Printed, exactly Calculated to every tenth part and quarter of an Inch, and also a Table of Area's of Segments of a Circle, by my good Friend Mr. <HI>Iohn Smith,</HI> in his Book of <HI>Gauging,</HI> to whom in gratitude I am obliged to render my hearty acknowledgment for many favours and kind assistances in these Studies; yet that you may be able to find any Area of a Circle upon demand, in Wine or Ale Gallons, without a Table, take this</P>
