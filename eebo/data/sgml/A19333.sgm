<P>IT is now first to be declared pri~cipally the nomi+nacion of the peinful~ places of hell. Wherfor it is to be knowen that helle is a place ful~ of fire &amp; is so called <HI>de infero infers</HI> / That is to saye to bere in / for the sowles of sinners be born~ into it for to suffre peine ther eternally. <ABBR>And</ABBR> therfor saith <HI>Iob</HI> in his vij chapitre. He that shal descende into <ABBR>hell</ABBR> shal not come ageyn ne euer retorne vnto his house. <ABBR>And</ABBR> also <ABBR>hell</ABBR> is oftentymes <ABBR>called</ABBR> gehenne of fire. The forsaid <HI>Seint Gregory</HI> in his fourth boke of his dyal~ogis saide. Certeinely it must be beleud y^t there is oonly but oon fire in the gehen~e of <ABBR>hell</ABBR> but it tormenteth not <ABBR>all</ABBR> sinners after oon maner / for
<PB REF="46">
euery man shal haue payne after the quantite of his gilte and trespace. <HI>Isidorus</HI> in the book of souerayn goodnesse seith that the fire of y^e gehenne of helle shal shyne &amp; leight to the dampned folkes in encrecyng of their paynes to then+tent that they may see their owne sorowes / it shal neither light nor shyne to their consolacion nor geue them cause of ony reioysing. The payn~ of thoes y^t be dampned is doubled by sorowe &amp; paynes that tourmentith the sowle and fire that brenneth y^e body. Of this fire of <ABBR>hell</ABBR> speketh the saw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r saiyng. The coles shal fal vppon synners whiche shal be cast into y^e fire hauyng no conforte in their miseries / our lorde shal tourmente them with his Ire &amp; the fire shal de|uour them. Wherfore it is writen in <HI>Isaye</HI> in the ix cha+pitre. The peple shal be as meete vnto y^e fire / it is also seid to euery synner in <HI>Ezechil</HI> in the xxj chapitre. Thou shalt be fire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> meete. In <HI>Iheremy</HI> the xv chapitre saith our lord to the dampned folkes. then brasyng fire inferrour <ABBR>shall</ABBR> broil &amp; brenne vppon you all&punc; this fire is of y^e nature that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">petually it s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al bren~ &amp; shal neuer haue nede to be <ABBR>renued</ABBR> It is writen in <HI>Iob</HI> the xx chapitre.

The flesshe of synners shal haue vengeance by fire.

It is writen in Isay in the last chapitre. that the fire for si~ners shal no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be quenched. Thridly in wasting. for our sensible materi+ale fire may consume &amp; wast al thingis as y^e philophre seith but the fire infernal may not wast nor consume neither the body nor the sowles of sinners by <ABBR>brennyng</ABBR>. <HI>Iob</HI> sayth in his xx chapitre of the synners <ABBR>beyng</ABBR> in helle. He shal bye <ABBR>full</ABBR> dere now that he hath doon &amp; yet he shal not be <ABBR>was+ted</ABBR>. <HI>Ioh~n Crisostom</HI> saith also that our materiale fire consumeth al thing that is leyd in hit / but the fire of hell tourmenteth continuelly thoes that be therin / &amp; yet it preser+ueth them alway in lengthyng their peines. Therfor it is said y^t it is not to be quenched not oonly because it can not be put out but that it shal not sease to distroy them y^t shal come therin. For that cause saith the holy scripture that y^e si~ner shal be clothed with corrupcion not oonly of their lif but in languisshing &amp; tormemendes alway com~yng. Cer|teinly no voyce coude expowne nor no word coude expresse the greetnes of y^e peine / nor the feruentnes of that fire. Alas what shal we do therfor there / &amp; what shal we answere for in <ABBR>hell</ABBR> shal be but grinding of tethe / yowling / criyng / &amp; we|ping in payne / but then~e penaunce is to late / and from <ABBR>all</ABBR> partes <ABBR>shall</ABBR> comforte and helpe be put away. there shal be no <ABBR>thyng</ABBR> but augmentacions of peynes. as that fire of helle is not of nature to deuour. no more is it to geue no comfortable lyght / It is an obscure fire / and the flam~ therof tenebrous. Secundly <ABBR>hell</ABBR> is called locus inquietus
<PB REF="47">
that is to sey / a restles place euer <ABBR>enduring</ABBR> &amp; shal neuer haue ende. wherfor it is seide in this lif y^t ther is one place which is alwey stil. that is to wite the centre of the skye Other be somtyme troubled as mene partis of y^e ayer / sem+blably it may be proued y^t the lowest parte is alweyes in trouble without rest.

<PB REF="47">
saith in his xxij chapitre. We haue example of this in <HI>Exode</HI> in the x chapitre by the maniable tenebres that were somtime in <HI>Egipte.</HI> O how mykel shal the tenebres of helle be more greuous than thoes. It is writen in <HI>Iob</HI> in the xx chapitre.

Semblably it is writen in the<HI> Lamentacions of Iheremy.</HI> They haue logged me with thoes that be sempiternally dede / there is therin an excessife hete. As <HI>Iob</HI> saith in his xiiij chapitre The hete is greet therin. &amp; the cause is that it breketh not out but is closed in / as the hete in an ouen. The <HI>Psalter</HI> saith. When~e thou art an angred thou shalt put the syn+ners in an ouen <ABBR>full</ABBR> of fire. Also our lord shal tormente them with his wrath. &amp; fire shal deuour them. there is ther also a right sharpe coolde / as is writen in <HI>Iob</HI> in the said chapitre. It is said the water of snowe is colder then al o+ther waters / yet y^e waters of helle may not be compared with of chilling nor coolde. And therfor seith <HI>Fulgencius</HI> in his pistles. Ther is in <ABBR>hell</ABBR> ij principale maner of tormentes that is to wite by intollerable coolde &amp; by inquencheable hete It is writen in y^e xxiiij chapitre of <HI>seint mathew.</HI> There shal be in <ABBR>hell</ABBR> bothe weping &amp; coolde. certeinly the effluccion of teeris by weping com~ith of hete / but the inward sorowes is caused by coolde. To this purpose witnesseth <HI>Iob</HI> in the said xxiiij chapitre. the sinner <ABBR>oupassed</ABBR> with the coold water
<PB REF="48">
of snowe / goeth after into the greet firy heates. It is founde also in a litle book of the dedis of <HI>Alexandre</HI> the <ABBR>kyng</ABBR> of <HI>Macedon~.</HI> That when~ he was for clomme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the Isse &amp; with the colde of y^e snowe he wolde goo to y^e fire of colis. O how myserable &amp; <ABBR>paynfull</ABBR> shal this trouble be to thoes that shal not dye nor haue <ABBR>lightnyng</ABBR> in y^e prison of helle. but be tourmented there infenitely. Fourthly hell is called a noyfull <ABBR>wayling</ABBR> place / <ABBR>and</ABBR> therfore af+ter Papie it is named Acheron / that is as mycle to seye as a place without Ioye lackyng <ABBR>all</ABBR> goodnesse. For this cause saith y^e <HI>Comentator Aueroys</HI> in the iiij chapitre of poetrie. That hell hath a <ABBR>continuell</ABBR> sorowe &amp; <ABBR>wepyng</ABBR> with out consolacion. In trouth the dampned folkes ther bene|the haue no counfort in the worlde for y^e orisons &amp; prayers that been saide in the chirche mylitant may profeite them no thing / and from aboue comyth there no helpe to them / ther falleth on them no misericorde. wherfore they be in dispaire of ony grace in tyme comyng and knowe certeynly y^t they without Remedy and not to be qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee out of the prison / &amp; so they rest sempiternally in waylyng in sorowe <ABBR>and</ABBR> in de+solacion.

As <HI>Pope Lyon</HI> saide in a sermon. And the <HI>Gospel of seint Mathew</HI> saith the xj chapitre. The Royalme of he|uen is wonnen in suffring of force &amp; violence in this world And it may wel be beleued. for Ihesus crist saide. that suf+fring of violence geteth it. A poete saide. Your <ABBR>lyuyng</ABBR> must be sharppe / your labour peinful / &amp; your clothing grie|uouse / and so must <ABBR>all</ABBR> your other thingis be here / if ye wole be logged there aboue in heuen. This may appere manifest+ly vnto you. Also in <HI>thactes of thapostles</HI> the xiiij chapitre is writen. How our entre into heuen must be by many tri|bulacions. O how wel was it vndrestande by <HI>Seint Au+styn</HI> / That oon may not entre the blys of heuen but by tri+bulacion &amp; peine in this worlde. For he saide. A my sowle if we shulde alweyes supporte and susteine tormented <ABBR>and</ABBR> peines here / and also suffre by a longe space the gehenne of helle / to thende that we might therby surely see our lorde Ihesu crist in his glorie and be accompanied with his seintis Now were it not an excellent digne thing to haue so greet a wele / as to be partiners to so perfaicte a glorie. <HI>Petre de bloys</HI> saide. My membres faille me by age / &amp; be <ABBR>enfebled</ABBR> by fastingis / and broken with labours / and I melte with teeres of myn~ eyen. But if al my brayn and the mary of my boones were conuerted into teeres / yet were it not suffi|sant passion in this present tyme in comparaison to atteigne therby the glorie to come. whiche shalbe shewed vnto vs If a man knewe what thing he is / and what it is of him and of god. he wolde thinke that suffring of. M. dethes for his sake were but as no thing. Beholde now how good &amp; how proufitable it is to suffre penau~ce for our lordes sake
<PB REF="74">
Susteigne it then gladly &amp; endure it benignely taking an exa~ple by mordereurs &amp; theuys conde~pned to deth / which wol+de greetly reioyse them self / if they might by the kitting of of oon of their eres haue their liues <ABBR>saued</ABBR>. Reioyse your self semblably in greet gladnes. for in doyng of a litle pe+nau~ce here ye may escape &amp; exclude the deth of your sowles &amp; winne theternale ioye.

To this purpose it is writen in Ecclesiastico the vj chapitre. Thou shalt a litle laboure and here in this world is the litlenesse of penaunce. <ABBR>and</ABBR> thou shalt soone ete and drinke the generacion therof. that is to vndrestande / the fruites of the glorie / whiche be en|gendred with the labour of penaunce. It is writen in the book of sapience the iij chapitre. Ye that be wery of a litle yet dispose you wel / and your remuneracion and rewarde shal be right greet. <HI>Seint Effram</HI> saide. My right dere <ABBR>and</ABBR> <ABBR>beloued</ABBR> brethren / the labour of our institucion is but litle / <ABBR>and</ABBR> the rest is greet. our affliction dureth not longe / but oure Retribucion / that is to wite / the de+lites of Paradyse. The Ioye <ABBR>and</ABBR> gladnesse there shall endure <ABBR>world</ABBR> withouten ende. The <HI>wise man</HI> saide in <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI> the last chapitre. Beholde how litle I haue laboured / and I haue fou~de for me greet rest. By the re|asons aboue writen it appereth manifestly / that though~ oure labours here be but litle and good / our rewardes in heuen may be greet and many. for the Ioyes there are im|possible to be comprehended or declared by vs. for there was

neuer erthely herte / that coude ymagine the playsirs therof nor to ony comparison eye coude see / nor ere here the delectaci+ons melodyes and swetnesses that be there. and the good+nesses ywys can not here directly be sauoured nor felt / but it may wel be surely thought / that all that euer is felt de|lectable or good in this present worlde is but as the resplen+disshyng <ABBR>and</ABBR> a shadowe of the goodnesse of heuen / whiche we ought to take as an allectif desiring to come to the ori+ginale <ABBR>and</ABBR> rote therof / <ABBR>and</ABBR> to haue parte of that moost preciouse blys / whiche is our enheritance. Now in conclu|ding finally it may appere by grete euidence and inuincible raisons / that the four last thingis aboue alleiged. whiche is to wite / the bodyly dethe / the daye of Iugement / the gehenne of helle / <ABBR>and</ABBR> the glorie of paradys defenden <ABBR>and</ABBR> withdrawen from synne in many maniers suche / as haue the same four last thinges withouten obliuion in a conti|nuale remembraunce.
