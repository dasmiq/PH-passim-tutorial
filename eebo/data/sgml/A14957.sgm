<HEAD>Necessary rules to be obserued for the guiding of children in their apparrell and otherwise.</HEAD>
<P>LEt not children haue their pleasures in the or|dring of their garments, some delight to haue them iagged and cut: but such fantasticknesse ought to be reformed by wiser and elder, considering their foolishnesse is beyond measure, if all may bee done at their pleasure: and ancient writers repute them out of their wits and mad men that fauour it.</P>
<P>Againe, painted and gawdy apparrell is not so fan|tasticke in childrens eyes; but as costly to the parents purses, whereby ancient writers proclaime such pa|rents fellow-fooles with their children.</P>
<P>The modesty and decency of the vestments of chil|dren are strong and good, not curious to the eye alone: And such as are cleane and without fowlnesse or fil|thinesse: Which after the estate and meanes of the parents ought to bee principall, so long as by the crafts man it be made with reasonable, and good form and fashion.</P>

<HEAD>How to order a childe in his diet for drinke.</HEAD>
<P>FOr a childe to make the beginning of his dinner drinke, is a good way to br&eacute;ed him vp to drunken|nesse. Especially, if he take it for wanton custome, and not for necessity of thirst. It is dishonest to bee suffered, and anoysome to the health of the body of a childe.</P>
<P>Let not a childe drinke after he hath supt hot broth, immediately vpon it; much lesse if he haue b&eacute;ene fed with milke.</P>
<P>Let not a childe drinke aboue twice or thrice at the most at one meale, and that gently, and not without reason: who bestoweth wine and beere on his childe beyond reason, defameth and abuseth him more by dishonouring his reason, and prouoking him to an vn|reasonable diet.</P>

<HEAD>To moderate the appetite of a childe from saw|cinesse and being liquorish.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SOcrates</HI> being olde, would not drinke of the first cup: for why? his braine was light, and the first drinke is euer the most fuming and ouercomming.</P>
<P>If thy childe be set with his betters, let his hand be last in the dish. And that hee doe it not at all, vn|lesse he bee first bidden. Neither suffer your children
<PB REF="13">
to put their hands or fingers into brothes, sawces caudles, or such like, at the table especially. Other wise let correction bridle their wantonnesse.</P>
<P>If he be of sensible y&eacute;eres, let him forbeare his fin|gers in a dish, and vse a knife without chusing at his pleasure: for it is vns&eacute;emely.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> often reprehendeth sawcinesse in these <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 word"> such like words, <HI>They boldly put their hands into the meat that is set before them.</HI> And as it is vns&eacute;emely to a liquorish person to traine his hands to euery side of the dish, so is it more vile to turne the best morsels in a dish towards thy selfe.</P>
<P>To gnaw bones belongeth ch&eacute;efly to doggs, but is is a ciuill thing to picke them cleane with a knife.</P>
<P>The licking of a dish belongeth to cats and dogs and not to children nor men, be the reliques neuer so sw&eacute;et, and betokeneth liquorishnesse, not manners.</P>
<P>To drinke or speake with meat in the mouth, is most vnciuill and dangerous withall.</P>
<P>Let the children rise from the boord when nature is sufficed, either by asking leaue, or withdrawing them|selues.</P>
<P>Let children beare away with them their tren|chers, saluting their parents, and first the ch&eacute;efe in the company, then the rest.</P>
