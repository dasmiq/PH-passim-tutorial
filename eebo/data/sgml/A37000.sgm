<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BE pleas'd, from your humble and most oblig'd
Servant, to accept this Off-spring of my Muse,
which I am the more incourag'd to lay at your Feet,
because it formerly had the Honour to be look'd upon
with a gracious Regard by the <HI>best of Queens, of late
happy and glorious Memory,</HI> before whom it had been
presented in her Court, if the ensuing <HI>National Fata|lity,</HI>
had not, in the interim, unfortunately happen|ed;
however, not to let it be intirely a Prey to ill De|stiny,
I have, with great Care and Pains, at last, made
shift to strip it from its Mourning, into a Dress
proper to be seen by the Town, tho' it may want
that Illustration which the Court-Ornament had a|dorn'd
it with: And therefore most humbly beg your
<HI>Lordship</HI> to make one Addition more to the many repeat|ed
Condescentions and Favours you have conferr'd on
me, which is, to let it be honour'd with a Place in
your Esteem; and then I shall never have occasion to
value what Malice, Ill-nature, or any unjust Criticism,
shall inveterately expose to its Prejudice.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
You are one, <HI>my Lord,</HI> that all Eyes are so much
upon, all Hearts so much inclin'd to honour, serve,
and love, and all Pens so oblig'd and ready to praise,
that, tho' my Heart be as full of desire to do it as is
possible, yet I find there is no place left void for me
to express my Duty; there is nothing to be said, which
has not been already, and perhaps too with more Ad|vantage
on the Writer's side, than I have Partiality
enough for my self to pretend to.</P>
<P>There is another significant Reason too, <HI>my Lord,</HI>
which wholly deters me from the common Custom of
<HI>Poets</HI> and <HI>Dedicators,</HI> which is, your Scorn and Dete|station
of Flattery, wherein you nobly imitate the
Royal Inclination and Humour of our Glorious Ma|ster,
King <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> who never fail'd to shew
his frowning Dislike of that <HI>Frenchified</HI> Vice, nor ever
gave Incouragement for its Seeds to be planted and
grow in his Dominions: To whom I wish Eternal
Honour, Successful Victory, and Long Life: And that
you, <HI>my Lord,</HI> in reward of your Indefatigable Duty,
Care and Zeal for his Service, may always be happy
in the Station you now are in. The Blessing of his
Smiles and Favour, is the Perpetual Wish of,</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE to the OPERA.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Mr. <HI>Dogget,</HI> dress'd like <HI>Collin,</HI> rises from under the Stage as frighted.</STAGE>
<L>OH!&mdash;oh!&mdash;</L>
<STAGE>Groans.</STAGE>
<L>From Crouds of Rogues, that did, like me, rebel;</L>
<L>Good People, I am just now scap'd from Hell,</L>

<L>(I shall love Wit the better all my Days)</L>
<L>Repriev'd from <HI>Pluto</HI>'s smoky Dungeon-hole;</L>
<L>A Convert, to save yours and my own Soul.</L>
<L>Ah, Criticks! leave off then, to Damn our Rhimes,</L>
<L>Lest you are Damn'd yourselves these devilish Times;</L>
<L>For, had you seen what I have seen below,</L>
<L>Such Reformation would amongst you grow,</L>
<L>You'd hear the Parson oftner than you do;</L>
<L>You'd have a wiser Rellish of what ill is,</L>
<L>And damn no more your poor Souls, for your <HI>Phillis,</HI></L>
<L>Your <HI>Cloris, Daphne,</HI> or your <HI>Amarillis;</HI></L>
<L>You'd leave the wanton Dabling in the Palm,</L>
<L>No more Chant Bawdy Songs, but Howl a Psalm:</L>
<L>Little did I think, in that Station, new,</L>
<L>To find so much Acquaintance 'mongst that Crew;</L>
<L>But there they were! A sad Tale, but 'tis true;</L>
<L>The Quoif, the Cassack, Red-coat, and the Blew,</L>
<L>The Cit, the Lawyer, and the Soldier bold,</L>
<L>And more damn'd Vintners than the place would hold;</L>
<L>Yet, for all these, the Virtuoso's there,</L>
<L>If I observ'd right, were Hell's choicest Ware,</L>
<L>Much more regarded than the duller Fry,</L>
<L>The Devil of late loves learned Company.</L>
<L>Time was, a House-breaker was a fine Guest;</L>
<L>But now, he's for a Wit, that breaks a Iest:</L>
<L>And has for each Degree peculiar Rooms,</L>

<SPEAKER>Hob.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to be short then, Neighbour <HI>Collin,</HI> for I know you are a
wise Man, and can see into a Mill-stone without Spectacles. You must
know we live in a most confounded condition, under this same Goat-fac'd
God, <HI>Pan,</HI> here, and his shag-rag Family, our Wives and Daughters are
not safe one hour of the day for 'em.</P>
</SP>

they'll ravish that too, they'll ravish any thing, nothing comes amiss to
'em, Neighbour.</P>

<P>Body o' me, I'm mortify'd when I think on't; why Neighbour I
did but send the poor Girl out a door to the Well to fetch a Pitcher of wa|ter,
and whip, one of these hairy Rag-muffins had trust her up, as a Hawk
does a Patridge: and had'nt we come just in the nick, and reliev'd her,
they would have us'd her as we do a wheaten Loaf, every one by this time
would have had a slice.</P>

<P>Ah! poor fool. And thus we are serv'd Neigbours, ever since

Sir, I have it in my head, d'ye hear Neighbours: We'll Rebel and
Right our selves; we'll live no longer under his Government: let's resolve
on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ay Sirs, now you come to the matter. Heark ye, bring
your Ears nearer to me, and listen to what I say: If you'll be of my mind,
you shall not only care a straw for this God <HI>Pan,</HI> but for never a one in the
whole pack. In short, Neighbours, we can live without 'em; what you
have heard of me, I hope, han't ye? why folks call me thrasher of the Gods,
I am always at open jarrs with them, they ne'r oblige me as I would have
it, with Corn, Pease, Beans, and so forth; nor I them their way, for I
ne'r go to Prayers, nor ne'r will; and see who will have the worst
on't.</P>

<SPEAKER>Coll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there 'tis now, I could ha' told him that by his Face; I can
discover a praying Logger-head, by his pale tallow Phiz, as certainly as
a drinker of Brandy by his red Nose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Low.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay for my part, I can't say much for their God-ships not I, but
yet methinks, for this same <HI>Cinthia</HI> that's comes among us here, to light us to
bed, and save Candles, I can't but think her a vertuous good body e|nough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw, prithee don't talk of her Virtue, she can never be good
that goes by so many Names, 'tis the trick of a Slut Neighbours; believe
me, in one place she's <HI>Luna,</HI> in a second she's <HI>Proserpine,</HI> and here, now she's
<HI>Cinthia;</HI> come without mealy mouth'dness, she's a Jilt, Gadsbud; why what
a plaguey trick did she serve that poor Huntsman, <HI>Ac-Ac-Acteon,</HI> I think
they call him, the honest harmless Fellow chanc'd to come by the Pond as
she was washing her&mdash;he happen'd to give a grin on her, or some such
small matter, when presently what does she do, but bewitches him with
the scent of a hard run Stag, gave an Hollow, and then set his own Dogs
upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay that was barbarous, introth Neighbours; then they say here's
her Brother <HI>Paul, Paul,</HI> what d'ye call him? <HI>Apollo, Apollo</HI> lyes lurking a|bout
her too, and comes smelling after a coy Wench, <HI>Daphne.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why what a noise there's made too about his Wit, and Musick,
why, 'tis true, the fellow's a good tollerable Harper, and can break a jest
at a City Wedding, or so, that's all, he kill'd a little rattle-Snake to'ther
day, and ha, ha, ha, he's so proud on't, ever since; besides that <HI>Daphne</HI> u|ses
him like a meer Nincompoop, she makes him carry her Slippers, or mend

<P>Ay, ay, Neighbour, let him say that. Go on, <HI>Clout,</HI> go on.</P>

<SPEAKER>Clout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Odsheartlikins, I must say that this <HI>Iupiter</HI> is of all
the rest, the most powerful: when he's pleas'd, the World rejoyces, but
bless us, when he's angry, Oh! how I tremble at his Lightning and Thun|der.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="13">
<SPEAKER>Coll.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Lord, did you ever hear such a damn'd silly puppy, come you
shall hear me tell the whole story of him. Look ye, this same <HI>Iupiter</HI> you
must know being sent as soon as he was born, away by his Mother, amongst
the <HI>Couribaates,</HI> a sort of poor fellows that belong'd to Powder-mills, for
fear his greedy gut Father <HI>Saturn,</HI> who us'd to breakfast on all his Male|brats,
should eat him, got the knack there of making Sky-Rockets, Squibbs,
and such like, and now when the maggot bites him, he's always whizzing
and popping 'em about, and this poor Animal takes 'em for Lightning and
Thunder; ha, ha, ha. Heark ye, Neighbour <HI>Hob,</HI> bid him tell us e're a
one of his friend <HI>Iupiter</HI>'s good deeds, and then you shall see how I'll
feague him.</P>

come?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good Deeds; why I heard he conquer'd the monstrous Giants,
which I think folks call <HI>Titau</HI>'s, and releas'd his old Father from Prison.</P>
</SP>

companionly sort of God, what think you of <HI>Bacchus?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why just as much as he thinks of any body else, that is nothing;
for he gets drunk as soon as he rises, and is past thinking all the day after.</P>
