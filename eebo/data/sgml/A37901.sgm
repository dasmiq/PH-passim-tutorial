<HEAD><HI>A LETTER of EXAMINATION. TO</HI> All you who have assumed the place of OVER|SEERS of the Flock, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>COME all you (that have assumed the title of) Shepherds. Overseers and Herdsmen of the Flocks of people of all sorts in Christendome, you have had the Oversight, Herding and Ordering of the multitudes of people for a long time; and the Lord hath been as a man in a far Country: and now he is coming to call you to account, and he will require the Flocks at your hands, and the time is near that you must give ac|count of your charge; and receive a recompence of reward from him according to your deeds.</P>
<P>This is a Warning to you all, to have your Accounts ready, and see that the Flocks be in good order, and that nothing be wanting; for you will not have any to meddle with the Flocks but your selves, so at your hands the Lord will require them.</P>
<P>Have you kept a dilligent Watch Night and Day with Carefuln<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s for their Soules? Have your Locks been wet with the Dew, and the Hairs of your Heads with the Frosts, to preserve their Feet in the way of Peace, and from the Devourer, and out of all fil thy and unclean wayes? Have you been as good examples before the se|veral Flocks in all things, walking before them as good patterns? Have ye led them to the pastures of Life, and fed them in due sea|son? Or have yee not played the Careless Idle Shepherds, Sitting in your Fat places, and Lying upon your Soft pillows, at your e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">e: Feeding with the Fat, and Sporting your selves in your day and time, whils't the several poor Flocks go astray in the by Paths, and are scattered in the bar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">en Wilderness, as Sheep wanting a Shepheard, and as a People lost their Guide; where their poor Soules are starved for want of the Bread of Life? Have yee led the severa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> Flocks to the Fountain of Living Mercies and Wel-spring of Life: and caused them to drink Freely, without Money, and
<PB N="4" REF="3">
be Refresh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">d, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">reby they all become Fruitful, and none Barren as the Flocks in <HI>Solomons Song</HI> chap. 6. ver. 5. or are they not dryed up Head and Tayl for want of the Springs of Life and so Unfruit|ful in any thing that is Good? And have not you in this condition led, and drove them, by your Example, and Perswasion; to the dirty Paddles and Kennels of Sin and Uncleanness? And have not you (the pretended) Heardsmen of all sorts perswaded the Flocks that this is that they must Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nk and Lick up whilst on this side the Grave? And is not your Flocks (as you call them) by that means fallen into grose disseafes, as Rottenness of Heart, Unsoundness of Mind, Blindness and Deafness, from seeing th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ir Salvation, and Hearing the Voice of the Lord Jesus? And are they not fallen into Lameness of Feet and Hands? and cannot walk upright in <HI>the just mans path, which is a Shining Light,</HI> but stumbles at it: nor cannot handle the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God; by which they should war against the Man of Sin, and break down his strong holds.</P>
<P>And by drinking Iniquity, Sin and Uncleanness, is not all the Flocks fallen into grose disseases? that there is no health in them, and become weak and feeble in the Faith that they should resist the Devil in, and overcome him: And have lost their tast, smell and savour in the things of God; and every thing that is seasoned with his Spirit and Power, become loathsome to their tast, by reason of the Diseases and Rottenness wanting Salt in themselvs to Savour withal, by which they should be a sweet savour of a sweet smelling Sacrifice to God, and to season the Earth. And through want of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; is not the Earth Corrupt? and the Creation Burde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, and Grones, and wai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">s to be delivered from under that Bondage.</P>
<P>And see now what you have in your Hoc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> (as you call them) to Offer to the Lord that may find acc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ptance w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">h him, will he accept of the Uncleane, Sick, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> or Blind? must no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Church that is presented to God b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">hout Spo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">, Wrinkl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> or any such thing? And nothing that is unclean can e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ter into his Kingdome. And have you Shepherds and Heardsmen (so called) of all sorts loo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ar fully to the sever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">l Flocks, to keep them from the spots of the world? or are they not run all over from head to tayle with a Scab? as a Leyrosy. And have you not played the lazy S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ep|heards, that looks not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> to the Flocks, or else the soph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">sters? For you have said, That you have the care and cure of Souls: and
<PB N="5" REF="3">
that you are the Phisitians: and your Flocks (as you call them) falling into such grose disseases and uncleanness, are not you the careless Shepheards, and Phisitians of no vallue? And would not you blame and be angry with the Herd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">men of your Flocks? and require your Flocks at their hands, and throw them into Prison till they made satisfaction, that should deal so badly with you, con|c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">rning your Flocks and Heards? And will not the Lord do so by you? and is it not reasonable, just and equal that he require the Flocks at your hands? For you have been well payd, for the look|ing to them; as you very well know, and the Nations can witness.</P>
<P>Have you kept one certaine voice? as the good Shepheard doth, that the Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ep might hear his voice and come together: and not stray and straggle, nor fall into Pits. Or have not your voices been variable, and changable as the wind, and given an unc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">rtain sound? And your Flocks (as you call them) never find a certain voice amongst you; and so are scattered into sects, devisions, and par|ties, pushing one another with Head, Horn, Arm and Shoulder into the Pit, and into the M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">re: inftead of helping one another out of the Mire, and out of the Pit. Againe, have you been careful to count the Flocks morning and evening, as Shpeheards ought to do, and usually doth, that none be wanting? Or have you not neglected this duty also, save at fleeceing time? And is not that like the Hire|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ing that cares not for the Flocks, but for the fleece? Have you kept the Flocks that you (pretend to) be Overseers of well marked with the Lambs mark in their foreheads, and in their right hands, that they may be known that they are his? For if they be not, but marked with another mark, will he not say, Depart I know you not? Have you acquainted the Flocks wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">h the fold of peace and safety, and to come into it gently, and rest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">n meekness and quietness? Or have you not been negligent, and they grown wild, as the wild Goats upon the mountains and as Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters">s unaccusto|med to the yoak, and as Heifers snuffing up the wind.</P>
<P>Have you not left the office of a Shepheard? and are not many of you turned Hunters; and hunts the Lords little Flock, whom he hath gathered by his Power, into his Spirit, and hath put them under the hand of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> Shepheard: that feeds them in due sea|son? Do not you hunt them as a Partridge, and make it your Game and Sport to Spoyle and Destroy them, as the Hook of your Prey: and prepare your tongues like Bowes, and your words like
<PB N="6" REF="4">
Arrows to destroy and cut them off? and you know them by the Shepheards mark from all the Flocks in Christendome (so called.)</P>
<P>And do not you Huntter-like, sound your Horns of Envy and Persecution, to awaken and stir up all of the like Mind with you, and the like Spirit, to Hunt and to Spoyle the Lords little Flock, as though they were not worthy to feed, and live upon Earth with the rest of the Flocks: as though the Earth were yours, and not the Lords: or as if he might not have as much priviledge as you to have a Flock upon Earth, as well as you, as though he had no right, but all were yours? and think you that the Lord seeth not this? and will not this anger him, and kindle his wra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">h, and hasten him to call you to account, and to reward you according to your works?</P>
<P>And may not he justly hunt you, who have been the cheife hunters of his: and prepare his Bow and his Arrows against you, and mark you out, and make you a hissing, and a by-word to the Nations? and is it not just for him to take the Flocks from you, who have been careless and neglected your service, and duty? and now will not let his Flock be quiet, but rend and teare them. Is it not Justice and Equity for him to rend the Flocks from you, and redeem them from your mouths, who will not suffer his, to receive the Law at his mouth whom he hath ordained a Priest for ever; whose Lipps preserve knowledge? Will not the just Principle in you answer to his Justice, that comes upon you with Equity to take the Flocks from you, and lay you aside like an old Alminack, and gather the Flocks, and put them under the hand of one Shepheard, Christ Jesus the good Shepheard, who will bring them to the fresh pastures of Life, and feed them in due season, and cause them to hear his voice, and to know it, and with his, fould, and to ly down in it, in quietness, meekness and patience; where none shall make them afraid: preserving from the storm, and from the heat, and and will bring them to the Well of clean water, and Fountain of living mercies, and cause them to wash and be clean, and to drink and be refreshed, that they may no longer be barren in fruits of holiness, but may bring for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">h to Gods glory; and will anoint their eyes, with eye salve, and open their blind eyes, and then they will see you to be blind guides, and bless the Lord that redeems them from you, and he will give them Balsome and pretious Oyntment, even virtue that goes out of him, the good phisitian that will cure their Spots, Scabs and Leprosies, which ran all over them whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">st
