<HEAD TYPE="sub">Yee shall know the Truth, and the
Truth shall sett you free.</HEAD>
<P>_TRVTH is so
much the Center
of the Spirit of
Man, as it pre|tends
to moue
towards it, euen in all the
digressions &amp; Deuiations it
makes from it. For euen most
<PB REF="4">
of our Errors &amp; Delusions
passe themselues vpon vs vnder
the notion of Truth. The Spirit
of Falsity disguiseth himself in|to
the Appare~ce of an Angel of
Light to haue the easier accesse.
Did not Pilate himself seeme
desirous to know Truth, when
he inquired of our Sauiour
<HI>what Truth was?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. 18. v. 38.</NOTE> But most
inquier like him; as soone as
menaced with this terror, if
you receaue it, you <HI>are no freind
to Caesar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Io: 19. v. 12.</NOTE> you incurre the dis|pleasure
of the State, and the
Penalty of the Laws, they de|cline
the further persute of
Truth, and shrinke into that
weakenes, which our Sauiour
reproached to his timorous in|quirers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. 12. v. 43.</NOTE>
<HI>they lou'd the Glory
before Men, more then the
Glory before God.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="4">Others there are, who seeme
frighted, as the children of
Isra&euml;l were, with the misre|ports
of the inhahitants of the
land of Chanaan, which were
falsely represented to them as
Gyants and Monsters; for so
their Pretending Explorators
disguise to them the Roman-Catholique
Religion vnder the
Forged figures of Idolatry, or
Superstitio~, to diuert an inquiry
into the true state and consti|tution
of it. But as when Io|suah
shew'd the children of
Isra&euml;l a true and sensible
parcel of the fruits of that
earth, they were disabused,
and inflamed with a desire to
partake of the blessed fertility
of the land of promise: so, Godbe
praised, there are many, who
vpon an equal &amp; ingenuous
<PB REF="5">
view of the true and natural
state of Catholique Doctrine,
are disabused, and protest a|gainst
the false reporters, as the
Psalmist did in reiection of
vaine inuentions of the Hea|thens;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 118. v, 85 &amp; 86.</NOTE>
<HI>Narrauerunt mihi ini|qui
Fabulationes; sed non vt
lex tua. Omnia mandata tua
Veritas. Vniust men make
their own storys; but what
they say is not like thy law.
All thy commandements are
Truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Here is therefore a true &amp;
naturall parcel of the fruits of
that land of promise, (the
Church of</HI> CHRIST) <HI>to which
this blessed promise was made,</HI>
that it should be led into all
Truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. 16. 13.</NOTE> <HI>and that</HI> CHRIST
IESVS <HI>the founder of it</HI> would
remaine with it vnto the end<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 28. v, 20.</NOTE>
<PB REF="5">
of the world. <HI>This promise
can not be verified in any
Church, which hath had a
notorious deficiency and inter|ruption
for many ages, whi|ch
marke of inconformity to</HI>
CHRIST'S <HI>figure and des|cription
of the True Church,
is euident in all the Preten|ded-Reformations.</HI></P>
<P>But the designe of this Au|thor
was, only a short &amp; ea|sy
exposure of such Catholique
Doctrines as the beleefe there|of
is fully sufficient to render
the professor an intire &amp; Or|thodox
Catholique; so that this
short Treatise may be call'd
rather a Factum of the case,
then Pleading of the cause,
since it doth but singly expose
the matter of Fact in all our
Beleefs, whithout any Argu|ing
<PB REF="6">
against the opposite Opi|nions.</P>
<P>Whereupon I may not im|properly
say this is a true pi|cture,
by the life, of Catho|lique
Religion, which designeth
only a iust and natural repre|sentation
of it, not a character
that raiseth &amp; beautifyeth the
figure it exposeth.</P>
<P>And in conformity to this
profession, the pious and pru|dent
Author declareth in the
close of this discourse, that it
was designed only for a Faith|full
Manifest in the name of
the Catholique Church; the
vtility whereof was expected
in the disabusing all ingenuous
Readers in those misreported
Doctrines, which are wrong|fully
imputed to her. And God
hath bless'd this pious proposall
<PB REF="6">
so, as to recommend it very
notoriously by the satisfaction,
which is profess'd to haue bin
receaued by one of the most
considerable persons of this age,
for the honour of his Birth, and
eminency of all sorts of Me|rit:
he hath acknowleged much
of his cleer &amp; full information
of the Catholique Doctrines,
as receaued from this excellent
discourse.</P>
<P>And surely I haue not seen
any edition of this nature, as
may be more aptly call'd a
Mapp of Catholique Reli|gion;
for all the lesser Contro|uersies
are marked out in very
smale points &amp; touches; but
the two Capital seates are dis|tinguish'd
by some larger mar|kes,
which represent them;
so you will find the Reall Pre|sence
<PB REF="7">
of <HI>CHRIST</HI> in the
Sacrament of the Eucharist,
and the Sacrifice of the Masse,
as being the Capitall sea|tes
of our Controuersies, ex|tended
in a much larger figure,
then the other questions; and
the drawing these two figures,
at their full length, &amp; with
their true features, was the
most requisit application, by
reason they are the most as|persed
&amp; disfigured by the
Maligners of the Church.</P>
<P>And these two Articles
rightly understood, as they are
profess'd and explain'd in this
Treatise, may promise the re|moue
of the greatest difficultyes,
which most frequently auert
many ingenuous &amp; candid
Protestants from entring into
an equal &amp; impartial inquiry,
<PB REF="7">
concerning the seeming dif|ficultyes
of these two points,
namely this of the Reall Pre|sence
of <HI>CHRIST'S</HI> Body
and Blood in the Blessed
Sacrament of the Eucharist,
as pretending its not being
cleerly explained; and likewise
the Controuersy about the Sa|crifice
of the Masse, as not
appearing euidently specified
in holy Scripture.</P>
<P>Me thinks these two may
not be improperly resembled
to the two great pillars of
brasse, call'd Booz and Iachin,
supporting the gates of the
Temple of Salomon; where|fore
these two points are sett
at their full length, solidly
founded, and fairely polished
by a cleer smoothing, and ex|plication
of the seeming harde|nes
<PB REF="8">
<HI>of those proposalls, which
were taken as a</HI> hard saying
<HI>coming euen out of</HI> CHRIST'S
<HI>own mouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jo&punc; 6. v. 61.</NOTE> but if rightly
vnderstood, following this Au|thor's
faire exposition, they
will be acknowleged, as our
Sauiour himself attested of
them,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jo. 6. v. 64</NOTE> Verba quae ego locu|tus
sum vobis Spiritus &amp; vita
sunt. The words that I haue
spoke vnto you, they are
Spirit and they are life.</P>
<P>And can there be imagined
a greater Blessing, next to the
Beatifical Vision, then the Re|all
Participation of the Body
and Blood of our Divine Sa|uiour
<HI>IESVS-CHRIST?</HI> Me
thinks that which would haue
bin the wish of all zealous
Christians, if it had not bin
the free guift and grati|fication
<PB REF="8">
of God, is this Reall
Partaking, euen in this life
of this blessed co~munication, by
which we may glory with S.
Peter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Pet. 1. v. 4.</NOTE> that by <HI>this precious
promise we are made parta|kers
of the Diuine Nature.</HI></P>
<P>And surely I haue not seen
any worke vpon this designe
wherein these two corner|stones
of the Catholique Church
haue a more solid foundation,
or that affords a more easy
comprehension of these two su|blime
mysteries.</P>
<P>By this motiue I haue bin
perswaded to passe into my
Country this forrein commo|dity,
which like a delicate
wine of the same place, may
loose somewhat of the natural
Spirit &amp; quicknes by the trans|port,
yet I may presume that
it retaineth all these health|full
<PB REF="9">
and cordiall qualities it
had in the natiue production.</P>
<P>And hauing heretofore
presented my Country in
their seuerall seasons Spring-Flowers,
and other Summer-Fruits,
as the Parfumes of Poe|sy,
and the Reflection of Mo|rality,
now in this winter of
my age I transport to my na|tion
this Riper and more whole|some
fruit, the feeding where|on
(contrary to the effect
denounced against the forbid|den
fruite) may produce life
euerlasting.</P>
<P>Vpon which hope I may
summon my Country in that
call of our Lord <HI>IESVS,</HI> com|manded
to be written by S.
Iohn, <HI>He that hath eares to
heare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apoc. 2.</NOTE> let him heare what
the Spirit saith to the Chur|ches&punc;;</HI>
<PB REF="9">
for that (with greife
I say it) the reproach of the
Prophet Esay may be so truly
applied to our Nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay. 50&punc; v 11.</NOTE> <HI>Behold
you kindle a fire, and com|passe
your selues about with
sparkes, and walke in the
light of your fire, and in the
sparkes that you haue kindled.</HI>
The strange diuersity of Sects,
and Severall professions of Re|ligion
doth too euidently appro|priate
this reproach of the Pro|phet;
wherefor the rest of my
life shall be assigned to sol|licite
God for the blessing
of the Primitiue Christians
vpon our so deuided Country to
be <HI>Cor Vnum,</HI> and Via Vna

<HI>that they may be One, as

<HEAD>AN EXPOSITION

OF THE CATHOLIQVE
CHVRCH.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">VPON THE POINTS OF
Controversie.</HEAD>
<P>_AFTER more then <MILESTONE N="I">
a whole Age's
contestation with
those of the Pre|tended-Refor|med
Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Designe of this Treatise</NOTE> the matters,
vpon which they have groun|ded
their breach, may be con|ceiued
sufficiently explayned,
and their minds disposed to a
right vnderstanding of the Ca|tholique
<PB N="2" REF="12">
Churche's Perswa|sions:
so that it seemes we
can doe nothing better then
propose them sincerely, and
distinguish them from those,
which have bin wrongfully
imputed; for in effect, I haue
observed in diuers occurren|cyes,
that the auersion those
persons expresse for the most
part, of our Doctrines, is de|riued
from the false ideas
that they haue figured of our
tenents, and most commonly
drawn from certain expres|sions,
which offend them so
much, as resting at first sight
vpon them, they neuer passe
forward to the enquiry
of the grounds of the
matter. Whereupon I haue
conceiued nothing could
be more vsefull then to ex|plaine
<PB N="3" REF="12" MS="y">
to them what the
Church hath defined in
the Councel of Trent touch|ing
those points which remo|ue
them the most from our
Communion, I will not the|refore
stay vpon what they
commonly obiect to our pri|uate
Doctors, or vpon those
matters which are neither
inioyned, nor vniuersally ac|cepted,
since all parties agree
and Mr Daille him'self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apol. c. 6.</NOTE> <HI>that
it is vnreasonable to impute
the perswasions of particular
persons vnto a whole body;</HI> and
he goes further, confessing
that one ought not to make
a separation, but vpon Arti|cles
Authentically establis|hed,
and whereof all sorts of
persons are obliged vnto the
Beleefe &amp; obseruation. I will
<PB N="4" REF="13">
not therefore fix vpon any,
but the decrees of the Coun|cel
of Trent, since it is there
the Church speakes Decisi|uely
of the matters in ques|tion
and what I shall offer
to facilitate the right vnder|standing
of those Decisions,
is approued by the same
Church, and shall appear ma|nifestly
conformable to the
Doctrine of that holy Coun|cel.</P>
<P>This explication of Doctri|ne
will produce two good
effects: the first, that diuers
disputes will entierly vanish,
by reason they will be discer|ned,
as grounded meerly vpo~
wrong explications of our
Beleefe; the second, the dis|putes
remaining will not ap|pear
(euen according to the
<PB N="5" REF="13">
principles of the Pretended-Reformers)
so capitall, as
they at first sight haue sought
to qualify them; and that,
euen by their owne princi|ples,
they contein nothing
that offendeth the grounds
of Faith.</P>
<P>And to begin with these <MILESTONE N="II">
Fundame~tall articles of Chri|stian
Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Those of the Pretended-Reformed Religion con+fesse that the Catholique Church pro|fesseth all the Funda|mentall Ar|ticles of Christian Religion.</NOTE> the Pretended-Reformes
must needs confess
that they are beleeued and
professed in the Catholique
Church.</P>
<P>If they state them in the
beleefe of adoring one single
God, Father, Sonne, and Ho|ly
Ghost; and the confiding in
God only by his sonne incar|nate,
crucified, and raysed
from the dead for us, they
are conuinced by their own
<PB N="6" REF="14">
conscience, that we protest
the same Doctrine: and if they
will add the other Articles
contayned in the Apostles
Creed, they doubt as little
of our professing them intier|ly,
without exception; and
doe not question our hauing
a pure and right vnderstand|ing
of them.</P>
<P>Mons^r Daill&eacute; hath writt a
treatise intitled <HI>Faith groun|ded
vpon the scripture,</HI> where|in
after having exposed all
the articles of Faith profes|sed
by the Pretended-Refor|med
Church, he Saith that
<HI>They are without contest; the
Church of Rome professeth the
beleife of them, and, true it is,
that they hold not all our opi|nions,
but that we hold all their
beleefs,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="14">Wherefore this Minister
cannot deny our beleeuing
all the principall articles of
Christian Religion, vnless he
will destroy his own Faith.</P>
<P>But had not Mons^r Daill&eacute;
graunted this, the matter
proues it self, since all the
world knowes that we pro|fess
the beleife of all those ar|ticles,
which the Caluinists
call Fundamentalls, so that
an ingenuous syncerity would
allow vs without dispute this
Assertion, that we haue not
waued or declined any of the
Essential perswasions.</P>
<P>The Pretended-Reformers
discerning the aduantages we
may draw from this conces|sion,
seeke to disapoint vs by
alledging that we destroy
those articles, by asserting
<PB N="8" REF="15">
others which are inconsistent
with them. This is what they
labour to euince by conse|quences
they inferr from our
doctrines: but the same M^r
Daill&eacute; whome I produce to
them (not so much to con|ui~ce
them by the testimony of
one of their most learned Mi|nisters
as) in regard that what
he saith being euident in it
self, teacheth them what they
ought to beleiue of those sorts
of consequences, supposing
that ill ones might be deri|ued
from our Doctrine. This
is what he saith in his letter
to Mons^r de Monglat vpon
the occasion of his Apologie;
<HI>Although the opinion of the Lu|therans
in point of the Eucha|rist,
inferres, according to vs,
as well as that of Rome the de|stru~ction
<PB N="9" REF="15">
of the humanity of</HI>
CHRIST JESVS, <HI>yet that
consequence, cannot be obiec|ted
to them without calumnie,
considering that they doe for|mally
reiect it.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing more Es|sentiall
to Christian Religion
then the verity of the Huma|ne
Nature of JESVS-CHRIST;
and yet (notwithstanding the
Lutherans hold a doctrine
from which is inferr'd a des|truction
of this Essentiall ve|rity
by consequences, the
Pretended-Reformers ac|count
euident) they haue not
scrupuled to offer them their
communion, in respect that
their opinion <HI>hath no poyson
in it,</HI> as M^r Daill&eacute; attesteth
in his Apologie: and their
Nationall Synod held at Cha|renton
<PB N="10" REF="16">
in 1631 admits the Lu|therans
<HI>to their Communion</HI>
vpon this ground, <HI>that they
agree in the principles and fun|damentall
points of their Reli|gion.</HI>
It is therefore a maxime
constantly established amo~gst
them, that we ought not in
this matter to consider the
consequences which may be
drawne from a Doctrine, but
simply what the party main|taineth,
and what he stateth
who professeth it.</P>
<P>So that when by conse|quences
they pretend to de|duct
from our Doctrine, that
we can not sufficiently ac|knowledg
the souueraine
glory due to God, nor the qua|lity
of Saviour and Mediator
in CHRIST JESVS, nor the
infinite dignity of Sacrifice,
<PB N="11" REF="16">
nor the superaboundant ple|nitude
of his merits; we
may easily defeate those con|sequences
by this short ans|wer,
which M^r Daill&eacute; him|self
furnishes vs with, by say|ing,
that the Catholique
Church disclaiming them,
they can not be imputed to
vs <HI>without calumny.</HI></P>
<P>But I will vndertake fur|ther,
and clear to the Pre|tended-Reformers
by the sin|gle
explication of our Doc|trine,
that so farr it is from
ouerthrowing the Fundamen|tall
articles of Faith either
directly, or by any just conse|quence,
that quite contrary
our Doctrine hath established
them in a manner so solide &amp;
so euident, that without pal|pable
injustice the aduantage
<PB N="12" REF="17">
of a right vnderstanding them
can not admit a question.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="III"> And to begin with the ado|ration
due to God;<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Religi|ous worsh|ip endeth in God alone.</NOTE> the Ca|tholique
Church teacheth
that it consists principally in
beleiuing that he is the Crea|tor
&amp; Lord of all things, and
in adhering to him with all
the powers of our soule by
faith, hope, and loue, as to him
who alone can conferr our
Eternall happinesse by com~u|nication
of the infinite Good,
which is himself.</P>
<P>This interior adoration
which we render to G'od in
spirit and in truth, hath its
exterior markes, of which the
principall is Sacrifice, which
can not be offered but to God
alone, by reason the homage
of Sacrifice is established in
order to a publike confession,
<PB N="13" REF="17">
&amp; a solemne protestatio~ of the
soueraingnity of God, and of
our absolute dependance on
him.</P>
<P>The same Church teacheth
that Religio~s Worship ought
to terminate in God, as be|ing
the necessary end and ob|iect
thereof; and if the ho|nour
she renders to the Bles|sed
Virgin and the Saints may
be termed an Act of Religion,
it is upon the ground that it
relateth necessarily vnto God.</P>
<P>Before I explaine further
in what this honour consis|teth,
it will be vsefull to ob|serue,
that the Pretended-Reformers
being press'd by
the power of euident truth,
begin to acknowledg that the
practise of praying to Saints,
and honoring their reliques,
was established in the Church
<PB N="14" REF="18">
euen in the fourth Century.
M. Daill&eacute; making this ack|nowledgment
in the booke
he writt against the Latine
Church touching the obiect
of Religious Worship, accu|seth
S. Basile, S. Ambro|se,
S. Hierome, S. John
Chrysostome, S. Augustin,
and diuers other great lights
of Antiquity which did shine
in that age; and aboue all the
rest S. Gregory Nazianzen
who is styled <HI>the Deuine</HI> as a
note of his excellency: he
taxeth all these with hauing
changed in this point the do|ctrine
of the preceding ages.
But surely it will seeme very
improbable that M. Daill&eacute;
should have better vnders|tood
the sentiments of the
three first ages, then those
who did as it were inherite
<PB N="15" REF="18">
their doctrine, immediately
vpon their death; and it is
by so much the lesse to be
beleiued, by reason that the
fathers of the fourth age we|re
so farre from perceauing
any introduction of new doc|trines
in this Act of Religion,
that this Minister himself ci|teth
expresse texts by which
they shew clearly, that they
pretended, in praying to
Saints, to follow the example
of their Predecessors. But not
to examin any longer the
iudgments of three primitiue
ages, I rest satisfyed with the
graunt of M. Daill&eacute; who
yealds to vs so many emi|nent
Doctors who did instruct
and discipline the Church in
the fourth Age. For though it
is an easy matter twelue hun|dred
years after their death
<PB N="16" REF="19">
to taint them by way of scorne
with the title of a Sect, cal|ling
them Reliquarists, as per|sons
who honored Reliques,
I will hope that those of his
Communion will beare more
respect to those eminent per|sonages:
they will not pre|sume
at least to object that
theyr praying to Saints, and
honoring their Reliques ren|dred
them guilty of Idola|try,
or that they ouerthrew
the confidence that Christians
are to haue in IESVS-CHRIST:
and we may hope that hence
forward they will forbeare
those reproaches when they
consider they can not apply
them to vs without laying
the same imputation vpon
so many excellent persons,
whose Doctrine &amp; Sanctity
<PB N="17" REF="19">
they professe to reuerence.
But since it is my worke to
exhibite here our Beleif, ra|ther
then produce the Man|tainers
of it, we must persue
the explication of it.</P>
<P>The Catholique Church <MILESTONE N="IV">
teaching the vtility of Prayer
to Saints,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inuocation of Saints. <HI>Rom. Ca|tech. p. 3. tit.</HI> de cultu&punc; &amp; Inuoc. sanct.</NOTE> aduiseth vs to pray
in the same spirit of charity,
and according to that order
of fraternall society, which
moues vs to request the suc|cors
of our bretheren liuing
vpon the earth; and the Ca|techisme
of the Councel of
Trent concludeth of this do|ctrine
that if the quality of
Mediator which the holy
Scripture attributeth to
CHRIST IESVS did receiue
any preiudice by the inter|cession
of Saints who reigne
<PB N="18" REF="20">
with God almighty, that it
would haue the same dimi|nution
by the offices and me|diations
of the faithfull who
are liuing with us.</P>
<P>This Catechisme infor|meth
vs clearly of the extre|ame
difference between the
manner of our imploring the
succour of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>p. 4. tit.</HI> quis sit o|randus.</NOTE> &amp; that of
our solliciting the contribu|tions
of the Saints, for thus
it says: <HI>We pray to God ei|ther
to giue vs good things, or
to deliuer vs from ill; but by
reason the Saints are more ac|ceptable
to him then we our
selfs, we request of them
their protection, &amp; sue to them
they would obteyn for vs these
things we stand in need of.
And hence it is that we vse
two kinds of prayer very diffe|rent;
<PB N="19" REF="20">
since when we address
to God, the proper style is,</HI>
HAVE PITTY ON VS &amp; BE|PLEASED
TO HARKEN TO VS:
<HI>but we account it sufficient
when we recurr to Saints, to
beseech them to</HI> PRAY FOR
VS. Whereby we must vn|derstand,
that in what termes
soeuer the prayers we offer
to Saints are styled, the in|tention
of the Church, &amp; of
the Supplicants reduceth
them alwayes vnto this for|me,
as the same Catechisme
confirmeth in the processe of
that discourse.</P>
<P>But it will not be amisse
to consider the words them|selfs
of the Councel which
intending to prescribe to the
Bishops in what manner they
should speake of the inuoca|cation
<PB N="20" REF="21">
of Saints, obligeth
them to teach <HI>that the Saints
who reigne with</HI> CHRIST IE|SVS
<HI>offer to God their prayers
for men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sess. 25. dec. de In|uoc. &amp;c.</NOTE> that it is good and
vsefull to inuoke them by way
of supplication, and to haue
recourse to their succours &amp;
assistances to obtayne of God
his benefits through his Sonne
our Lord</HI> CHRIST IESVS <HI>who
alone is our Sauiour &amp; Redee|mer.</HI>
And in order to this de|claration,
the Councel con|demneth
those who teach a
contrary doctrine; whereby
it is euident that to inuoke
the Saints according to the
intent of this Councel, is to
resort to their prayers, for
the obteyning the blessings
and benefits of God by
CHRIST IESVS. And in truth
<PB N="21" REF="21">
what we obteyne by the in|teruention
of Saints, we ac|quire
only by CHRIST IESVS,
and in his name; since the
Saintsthemselfs intercede but
by CHRIST IESVS, and ob|teyne
their graunts but in his
name. This is the Faith of
the Catholique Church wh^c^h
the Councel of Trent hath
cleerly explained in few
words: after which euidence
we cannot conceaue how it
can be obiected, that we de|part,
&amp; remoue our selfs
from CHRIST IESVS, when we
supplicate his members,
which are also ours; his chil|dren
who are our brothers;
and his Saints who are our
first fruits, to ioyne their
prayers to ours, offering them
both to our common Master,
<PB N="22" REF="22">
in the name of our common
Mediator.</P>
<P>The same Councel explai|nes
cleerly in few words the
meaning of the Church, when
it offers to God the holy sa|crifice,
to honor the me|mory
of the Saints. That ho|nor
we render them in the
act of Sacrifice consists in
mentioning their names, as
of the faithfull seruants of
God, in the prayers we ad|dresse
to him, thankes-gi|uings,
and prayses for the
victories they haue obtey|ned,
and in humbly mouing
his condescending in our fa|uor
by their Intercessions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 8. de Ciu. c. 27.</NOTE> S.
Augustin hath declared 1200
years past that none ought
to conceiue the Sacrifice as
offered to the holy Martyrs,
<PB N="23" REF="22">
although by the custome in
practise euen in those tymes
vniuersally by the Church,
the Sacrifice was offered vpon
their holy bodies, &amp; vnto
their memories, that is to
be vnderstood, before the
places wherein their preti|ous
Reliques were conser|ued;
and the same father
sayth further, that comme|moration
was made of the
Martyrs at the holy table
at the celebration of the Sa|crifice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tract. 28. in Joan. serm. 27. de verbis A|postoli.</NOTE>
not intending to pray
for them as we doe for other
dead, but rather in order to
their praying for vs. I all|edge
the perswasion of this
holy Bishop by reason the
Councel of Trent vseth al|most
the same words to in|struct
the faithfull,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co~c. Trid. sess. 22. c. 3.</NOTE> <HI>that the
<PB N="24" REF="23">
Church offers not the Sacrifice
vnto the Saints, but to God
alone, who hath crown'd them:
and that the Priest doth not
adresse himself to S. Peter or
S. Paul saying:</HI> I OFFER
VNTO YOV THIS SACRIFICE,
<HI>but praysing God for their
victories, he implores their as|sistance,
to the end that they,
whose Commemoration we
celebrate vpon Earth, may be
moued to pray for vs in Hea|uen.</HI>
This is the manner
wherein we honour the
Saints, to obteyne graces
and benefits from God by
their Mediation, and the
cheifest of those fauors
we hope to procure is that
of being inabled for their
imitation, to which we are
excited by contemplation of
<PB N="25" REF="23">
their admirable precedents,
and by the honour we pay
in the presence of God to
their blessed memories.</P>
<P>Whosoeuer shall rightly
consider the doctrine we ha|ue
proposed, will be forced
to auowe, that as we substract
from God none of the per|fections
peculiar to his infi|nite
essence, so we doe not
ascribe to Creatures any of
those properties or operati|ons
the which can not sort
but with God alone: which
doth so absolutely distin|guish
us from Idolaters, that
we can not conceiue vpon
what ground they lay that
imputation.</P>
<P>And when the Pretended
Reformers obiect, that in
our addressing our prayer to
<PB N="26" REF="24">
Saints, and in honouring them
as if they were present all
ouer the earth, we attribute
to them a kind of Immen|sity,
or at least the knowledge
of the secret of harts, which
appears reserued singly to
God by so many testimonies
of the Scripture; in this ob|iection
they doe not appre|hend
our doctrine right: for
in fine abstracting from the
ground we may haue to
attribute to the Saints some
certain degree of knowledge
of such occurrencies as passe
amongst vs, or euen of our
secret thoughts, it is euident,
that it is no eleuation of the
creature transcending its
condition, to affirme that it
hath some notion of things
by the light which God in|fuseth
<PB N="27" REF="24">
by his communication.
The example of the Prophets
attests this clearly, God ha|uing
vouchsafed to discouer
to them future euents, al|though
they seeme to be re|serued,
much more special|ly,
to the Omniscience of
God.</P>
<P>But besides this, neuer any
Catholique conceiued that
the Saints by themselues did
discerne our wants, nor euen
the desires for which we ad|dresse
particular prayers. The
Church is content to teach,
concurrently with all Anti|quity,
that such prayers are
very beneficiall to those who
practise them, whether the
Saints apprehend them by
the ministery &amp; commerce
of Angels, which, according
<PB N="28" REF="25">
to the profession of the
Church, know what passeth
amongst vs (as being appoin|ted
by God's order as mi|nistring
spirits to concurre in
the worke of our Saluation)
or be it that God himself
acquainteth them with our
desires by a speciall reuela|tion;
or be it that God re|ueileth
to them that secret
in his diuine essence, where|in
all truths are comprehen|ded:
so that the Church
vpon these different manners
hath not determined by
which of them God is plea|sed
to make this communi|cation
to his Saints.</P>
<P>But by what means soeuer
this knowledge is imparted,
it is very certain that it is
farr from ascribing to the
<PB N="29" REF="25" MS="y">
creature any of the diuine
perfections, as the Idolaters
did, since it doth not permit
our attributing euen to the
greatest Saints any degree of
excellence, which is not de|riued
from God, nor accep|tablenesse
in his eyes, but as
deriued from their virtues,
nor any virtue but what is
the free guift of Grace, nor
any information of humane
passages but such as God is
pleased to communicate, nor
any capacity to assist vs, but
only by their prayers, nor in
fine any felicity, but by a
perfect submission and con|formity
to the diuine plea|sure.</P>
<P>It is therefore most cer|tain
that vpon penetration
into our interior sentiments
<PB N="30" REF="26">
directed to the Saints, it will
be euident that we doe not
raise them aboue the condi|tion
of Creatures, and from
this ground one ought to
be possess'd of the true na|ture
of that honour and re|uerence
which is intended
by our exterior demonstra|tions,
the apparent religious
offices being appointed to
testify the interior sentiments
of our minds.</P>
<P>But by reason that the ho|nour
which the Church of|fers
to Saints appeareth most
notoriously before their Ima|ges,
and their holy Reliques,
it is requisite to explaine the
Churches syncere doctrine in
this Religious Act.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="V"> In point of Images the
Councel of Trent forbids<NOTE PLACE="marg">Images and Reliques.</NOTE>
<PB N="31" REF="26">
expressely <HI>to beleeue any Di|uinity<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conc. Trid. sess. 25. decr. de Inuoc. &amp;c.</NOTE>
or power in them, for
which we ought to reuerence
them, or to sue for any fauor,
or to place any confidence in
them:</HI> and ordains that <HI>all
the honour should relate to the
Originalls they represent.</HI></P>
<P>All these words of the
Councel are so many cha|racters
which serue to dis|tinguish
vs from Idolaters,
since we are so farr from be|leeuing
with them any Di|uinity
residing in the Ima|ges
as we attribute no vir|tue
to them, but this, of
exciting in vs the remem|brance
of their originalls.</P>
<P>Vpon this it is that the
honour we render to Ima|ges
is grounded: for exam|ple,
can one deny that the
<PB N="32" REF="27">
figure of IESVS-CHRIST cru|cified,
when we behold it,
doth not excite a more liue|ly
remembrance of him <HI>who
loued vs so as to deliuer him|self
vp to death for vs?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 2.</NOTE> As
long as the present Image
possessing our eyes enter|tains
so pretious a notion
in our minds, we are mo|ued
to expresse by some ex|terior
markes, the feruor
and extent of our gratitude,
and we declare by our hu|miliation
before the Image
how profound our submission
is respectiue to the Original.
Wherefore speaking strictly
according to the style of the
Church, when we render
any honour to the Image of
an Apostle or Martyr our
ayme is not so much to ho|nour
<PB N="33" REF="27">
the Image, as the A|postle
or Martyr in pre|sence
of the Image. To this
purpose the Roman Pontifi|call
declareth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pontific. Rom. de Benedict. Imag.</NOTE> and the Coun|cell
of Trent expresseth the
same intent, when it saith,
<HI>that the honour we render to
Images,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co~c. Trid. Sess. 25. dec. de In|uoc. &amp;c.</NOTE> is so referr'd to the
Originalls, that by the means
of the Images we kisse, and
before which we kneele, we
adore</HI> CHRIST IESVS, <HI>and ho|nour
those Saints which they
represent to vs.</HI></P>
<P>In fine we cleerly discer|ne
in what Spirit the Church
honoureth Images, by the ho|nour
it renders the holy
Crosse, or the booke of the
Gospel. All the world sees
cleerly that before the Crosse
the Church adoreth him <HI>who
<PB N="34" REF="28">
did beare our sinn's vpon that
wood;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 2.</NOTE> and that when her
children bow their heads be|fore
the bookes of the Gos|pel,
when they stand vp in
respect at theyr passing by
them, and kisse them reue|rently,
all this honour ter|minateth
in the Eternall Ve|rity
which is exposed to vs
by that Instrument.</P>
<P>There must then be very
little equity in calling Idola|try
that Religious sentiment,
which moueth vs to vncouer
and bow our heads before
the Images of the Crosse, in
reflection vpon him, who
was crucyfi'd for our sakes;
and one must be starke blin|de,
not to discerne the ex|treame
difference between
those who confided in Idols,
<PB N="35" REF="28">
vpon this opinion, that some
Diuinity or some virtue was
at is were fastned vnto them:
and them who professe, as
we doe, that they intend not
to make any vse of Images,
but simply to raise their spi|rit
vp to heaven with the
intent of honouring CHRIST
IESVS, or his Saints, and in
them God himself who is
the author of all grace and
Sanctification.</P>
<P>Vnder the same notion,
the honour we pay to Reli|ques
is to be apprehended,
following the stepps of the
primitiue Ages; and if our
Aduersaries did reflect, that
we consider the bodies of
Saints as hauing bin victi|mes
to God either by Mar|tyrdome,
or Pennance, they
<PB N="36" REF="29">
would not conceiue that the
honour we render them, v|pon
this motiue, can depart
or remoue vs from that we
owe to God himself.</P>
<P>And we may say in gene|rall,
that if they would com|prehend
in what manner
the affection we beare to so|me
one body extendeth
(without deuiding it self)
to his children, to his fre|inds,
and successiuely by de|grees
to all that represents
that person, to all that re|mains
of him, or any thing
that receiueth the memory
of him; if they did compre|hend
that our honouring ma|kes
such a progress, since in
effect our honouring is noth|ing
else but <HI>loue mixt with
feare and respect;</HI> in fine if
<PB N="37" REF="29" MS="y">
they did comprehend that, all
the exterior worship of the
Catholique Church riseth,
and springeth in God him|self,
and that it reuerts thi|ther,
they would neuer sus|pect
that those Religious
acts (which God alone doth
animate) could provoke his
iealousy. They would per|ceiue
the quite contrary, and
find that if God, as iealous
as he is of the loue of men,
doth not account that we de|uide
between him and the
Creature when we loue our
Neighbour for his sake: the
same God, as iealous as he
is of the duties of his ser|uants,
doth not conceiue
them to share or part the
worship which they owe to
him alone, when from the
<PB N="38" REF="30">
motiue of the dutys they
owe him, they honour tho|se
who haue bin honoured by
himself.</P>
<P>Yet true it is that as the
sensible markes of reuerence
are not all of absolute ne|cessity,
the Church, without
any alteration in the Doctri|ne,
may haue extended more
or lesse those exterior practi|ses,
suting to the diuersity
of times, places, and other
occurrencies, not intending
that her children should be
seruilly subiected to visible
matters, but only that they
might be excited, and as it
were aduertised by their
means to apply themselfs to
God, to offer him in spirit
and truth that reasonable and
due seruice he expecteth
from his creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="30">It may easily be discerned
by this Doctrine with how
much truth I have asserted,
that a great part of our Con|troversies
would vanish by an
only right vnderstanding of
termes, if these were dis|cussed
with Charity; and if
our Aduersaries did consider
calmely the precedent expli|cations,
which comprehend
the expresse Doctrine of the
Councel of Trent; they
would forbeare to obiect to
vs that we injure the Me|diation
of CHRIST IESVS, and
that we inuoke Saints, adore
Images in a manner peculi|ar
to God himself. It is gran|ted
by reason that in some
sense Inuocation, Adoration,
and the name of Mediator
are competent only to God
<PB N="40" REF="31">
and CHRIST JESVS, that
it is easy by a perverse vse
of those termes, to traduce
our Doctrine and render it
odious; but if they are
ingenuously receiued in that
sense we haue exhibited,
these obiections loose all
their force; and if there re|mayne
in the minds of the
Pretended Reformers any
lesse important difficultyes,
naturall equity and syncerity
will oblige them to auowe
themselues satisfy'd in the
principall exceptions.</P>
<P>Besides this, there is
nothing more vniust then to
charge the Church with the
stating of all piety in this de|votion
to Saints, since as we
haue already euinced, the
Councel of Trent iudgeth
<PB N="41" REF="31">
it sufficient to informe and
teach Catholiques that this
practise is <HI>Good &amp; Vsefull</HI>
without advancing it fur|ther,
so that the Churches
intent is, to condemn such
as reiect this practise either
by Contempt or Miscon|struction:
and the Church is
obliged to condemn them by
reason that she ought not to
indure the condemning of
salutary and usefull practises,
nor that a Doctrine, which
all Antiquity hath authori|sed,
should be reiected by
the Nouellists Doctors.</P>
<P>The matter of iustification <MILESTONE N="VI">
will manifest yet a greater
light how many difficulties
may be avoyded by a syn|cere
exposition of our opini|ons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iustification.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="32" MS="y">Those who are never so
little acquainted with the
history of the Pretended Re|formation
can not be igno|rant,
that those who were
the first Authors of it, did
propose this Article to all
the world as the principall,
and as it were the most es|sentiall
ground of their se|paration;
so that this seemes
the most necessary point to
be rightly understood.</P>
<P>First we beleeve <HI>that our
sinns are forgiuen freely by
the divine mercy for</HI> JESVS-CHRIST'S
<HI>sake:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conc. Trid. Sess. 6. cap. 9.</NOTE> these are the
expresse termes of the Coun|cel
of Trent, which addeth
further that we <HI>are said to
be iustified freely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ibid. c. 8.</NOTE> because
none of those things which
precede our iustification, either
<PB N="43" REF="32">
our faith or our works, can
merit this grace.</HI></P>
<P>And by reason the holy
scripture explains to us the
remission of our sinns expre|ssing
it some times, by say|ing
that God couers them;
and others, that he takes
them quite away and effa|ceth
them by the grace of
the holy Ghost, which ren|ders
vs new creatures, we
conceiue that we are to
combine all these expressi|ons
to forme a compleate
Idea or notion of the iustifi|cation
of a sinner; we doe
therefore beleeue that our
sinns are not only couered,
but intirely effaced by the
blood of <HI>CHRIST IESVS,</HI> and
by the grace by which we
are regenerated: and this
<PB N="44" REF="33">
perswasion is so farr from
detracting from that image
we ought to frame of the
merit of that blood, as quite
contrary it indeareth and
eleuateth the value of it; for
by this meanes the righte|ousnes
of Christ is not sim|ply
imputed, but actually
imparted to the faithfull, by
the operation of the holy
Ghost, in so much as they are
not only imputed, but euen
rendered righteous by the
grace of Christ.</P>
<P>If our righteousnes were
only in the sight of man, it
would not be the operation
of the holy Ghost: it must
then be iustice euen before
God, since it is God him|self
who produceth it in vs
by an effusion of his charity
vpon our harts.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="33">It is notwithstanding but
too true that <HI>the flesh lusteth
against the spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">. 17.</NOTE> and the spi|rit,
against the flesh:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iac. 3. 2.</NOTE> and <HI>we
all offend in many things.</HI>
Wherefore albeit our righte|ousnes
be a true one, by the
infusion of Charity, yet is
it no perfect one by reason
of the combat between it &amp;
our concupiscence: so that
the sighing and sorrowing of
a soule repenting her sinns,
performes the most necessary
duty of Christian righteous|nes,
which obligeth vs to
confesse with S. Augustin that
our righteousnes in this life
consists rather in the remis|sion
of our sinns, then in the
perfection of our virtues.</P>
<P>Wherefore as to the point <MILESTONE N="VII">
of Merit<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merits of good wor|kes.</NOTE> imputed to our
<PB N="46" REF="34">
workes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concil. Trid. Sess. 6. c. 16.</NOTE> the Catholique
Church teacheth <HI>that Eter|nall
life ought to be proposed
to the children of God, both
as a Grace mercifully promi|sed
by the meanes of our Sa|uior</HI>
IESVS CHRIST, <HI>and as a
Reward which is faithfully
rendred to their good workes,
and to their deserts in virtue
of that promise:</HI> these are the
expresse termes of the Coun|cel
of Trent; but least the
pride of humane nature
should be flattered by the
opinion of a persuming Me|rit,
the same Councel de|termineth,
that all the worth
and value of Christian good
workes is deriued from that
sanctifying grace, which is
freely conferr'd vpon vs in
the name of CHRIST JESVS,
<PB N="47" REF="34">
and that is an effect of the
continuall influence of that
diuine head vpon his depen|ding
members.</P>
<P>True it is indeed that the
exhortations, the promises,
the menaces, and reproaches
of the Gospel doe declare
sufficiently, that we are to
worke our saluation by the
motion &amp; actings of our
own wills, concurring with
the Grace of God which
assists vs, but it is a fixt prin|ciple
that free will can per|forme
nothing in order to
Eternall beatitude, but by
the same degrees it is mo|ued
and eleuated by the ho|ly
Ghost.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Church
knowing that it is the holy
spirit which worketh in vs
<PB N="48" REF="35">
by his Grace all the good we
doe, she ought to rest per|swaded
that the good wor|kes
of the faithfull are very
acceptable to God, &amp; of
great estimation in his sight,
and she doth rightfully vse
the terme of Merit concur|rently
with all Christian An|tiquity,
cheefly to signify
the value &amp; dignity of our
workes, which we performe
by the motion of his Grace.
But by reason all their sanc|tity
is deriued from God,
who workes them in vs, the
same Church hath receiued
from the Councel of Trent,
as the Doctrine of the Catho|lique
Faith, this saying of S.
August. that God crowns his
own Gifts when he crowns
the Merits of his seruants.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="35"><HI>We intreate all such as

that the Apostle declareth, that
a moment of light payne suf|fered
in this world, shall pro|duce
an Eternall weight of
glory; yet God forbid that a
<PB N="50" REF="36">
Christian should trust &amp; glo|ry
in himself, and not in our
Lord, whose goodness towards
Man is so aboundant, that
he allowes his own Guifts to
them to be accounted their Me|rits.</P>
<P><HI>This Doctrine is spread
through the whole Councel
which teacheth in an other
session,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sess. 14. c. 8.</NOTE> that we who are not
sufficient to doe any thing alo|ne
by our selues, can doe euery
thing by him who inableth
vs; so that Man hath nothing
wherein he can glorify him|self,
nor any cause to confide
in himself, but that all his
confidence and his glorying is
in <HI>CHRIST JESVS,</HI> in whom
we liue, and in whom we
merit, in whom we satisfy
bearing worthy fruits of repen|tance,
<PB N="51" REF="36">
which deriue their po|wer
from him, and by him
are offered to God the Fa|ther,
&amp; in him are ac|cepted
by the Father. <HI>So
that we preferr all our sui|tes,
place all our hopes, ren|der
all our thanks by our
Lord IESVS-CHRIST. We
proclaime in a loud voice
that we are acceptable to God
only in him &amp; by him; and
we can hardly conceaue how
any other intent or applica|tion
can be imputed to vs.
We fix in him alone so in|tirely
all the hope of our
saluation, as we present to
God euery day those words
in the Sacrifice:</HI> Vouchsafe
&ocirc; God to graunt vnto vs sin|ners,
your seruants, who hope
in the multitude of your Mer|cys,
<PB N="52" REF="37">
some part and fellowship
with your blessed Apostles and
Martyrs ... into which we
humbly beg to be admitted,
not considering our Merit,
but forgiuing vs by your Mer|cy,
for our Sauiour's sake
<HI>CHRIST IESVS.</HI></P>
<P>Shall the Church neuer
be able to persuade her chil|dren,
now become her enne|mies,
neither by the expli|cation
of her Faith, nor the
decisions of her Councells,
nor by her most solemn
prayers presented in her Sa|crifices,
that she doth not
owne any life, nor conceaue
any hope, but in the merits
of IESVS-CHRIST alone; and
this hope is so powerfull,
that it imprints in the chil|dren
of God, who walke
<PB N="53" REF="37">
faithfully in his ways,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 4. 7.</NOTE> <HI>that
peace which passeth all vnder|standing,</HI>
as the Apostle
assures vs. But yet although
this hope be stronger then
the promises or menaces of
the world, and be sufficient
to calme the terror of our
conscience, yet doth it not
suppresse intirely our feare,
by reason that, though we
are assured that of himself
he neuer doth abandon vs,
we can neuer be certain that
we shall not depart from
him by our own faylings in
reiecting his inspirations: and
God hath bin pleased to
temper &amp; allay by this sauing
feare, that confidence he in|spireth
into his children: for
as S. Augustin saith, such is
our weakenesse in this seate
<PB N="54" REF="38">
of perills &amp; temptations, that
an entire assurance would
produce in vs slacknesse and
presumption; whereas this
fear, which in the Apostle's
mind <HI>makes vs worke our
saluation with fear and trem|bling,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2. 12.</NOTE>
renders vs more vigi|lant,
and moueth vs to fasten
our selues by an humble de|pendance
on him <HI>who wor|keth
in vs by his grace the
will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ibid. 13.</NOTE> and the acting accor|ding
to his good pleasure</HI> as
the same S. Paul declares
vnto vs.</P>
<P>This is what is most necessary
to be held and practised in
the Doctrine of iustification,
and our Adversaries must be
very vnreasonable, and per|verse
not to confesse that this
Doctrine is sufficient to in|struct
<PB N="55" REF="38">
Christians in their duty
of attributing to God by
CHRIST IESVS all the glory
of their saluation.</P>
<P>If the Pretending-Refor|mers
after this exposition fly
vnto nice &amp; subtile questions,
it is not amisse to aduise them
that, it is not now proper to
raise, or insist vpon needlesse
difficultys, reflecting vpon
what they haue condesce~ded
vnto, towards an vnion with
the Lutherans, and what
they have graunted to their
own fraternity in the points
of Grace &amp; Predestination.
That proceding ought to ha|ve
instructed them to restrain
&amp; confine their inquiries, in
this matter, to that singly
which is of absolute necessity
<PB N="56" REF="39">
to establish the foundation of
Christian piety.</P>
<P>And if they could once
resolue to bound themselues
within those limits they
would quickly be satisfied, &amp;
soone would desist from their
obiecting to vs our nullify|ing
the Grace of God by our
ascribing all to good workes:
since we haue euindenced to
them in so cleer termes of
the Councel of Trent these
three points so decisive in this
matter, viz. <HI>That our sinns
are pardon'd by pure mercy for</HI>
CHRIST JESVS <HI>his sake. That
we owe vnto a free &amp; graci|ous
liberality the righteousnesse
infused into vs by the holy Spi|rit.
And that as many good
workes as we performe, are
so many free guifts of grace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="39">And we cannot but con|fesse
that the most Learned of
their party doe not now con|tend
so much in this point
as they did at the beginning
of the Schisme, and there
are few that will not auowe,
that a Separation ought
not to haue bin made vpon
this Controversy. But if this
so important difficulty, in
the point of Iustification, of
which their first Authors rai|sed
their strongest fort, is no
longer accounted so capitall
by the most intelligent and
sufficient persons of their
party, we desire them to re|flect,
what iudgment ought
to be made of their Separa|tion,
and how much we
might hope a Reconciliation,
if they would raise their
<PB N="58" REF="40">
minds from vnder all pre|possession,
and renounce the
spirit of Contention.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="VIII"> It will not be amisse that
I explaine further in what
manner we conceaue our
selues capable to satisfy God
by his Grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satisfacti|ons, Purga|tory, &amp; In|dulgences.</NOTE> in order to the
leauing no doubt or scruple
in this matter.</P>
<P>The Catholiques doe vna|nimously
professe &amp; teach
that CHRIST IESVS only, God
&amp; Man vnited, was suffici|ently
qualifyed, by the infi|nite
dignity of his person, to
make satisfaction for our
sinns; but hauing supera|boundantly
satisfyed, he had
power to apply vnto vs an
entire abolition, without re|seruing
any punishment: or
by commutation of a grea|ter
<PB N="59" REF="40">
into a lesser penalty; that
is, exchanging an Eternall
paine into Temporall suffe|rances:
and by reason that
this first sort of mercy is the
most compleat, and most
suting to his goodnesse, he
hath taken that course in
our Baptisme: but we main|taine
that he vseth the se|cond
manner in the remis|sion
he graunteth to those,
who after Baptisme relapse
into sin, being in a manner
forced to it by the ingrati|tude
of those who haue abu|sed
his guifts: so that such
offenders are condemned to
some temporall paines, al|though
the Eternall punish|ment
be remitted.</P>
<P>But from hence it ought
not to be inferr'd that IESVS-CHRIST
<PB N="60" REF="41">
hath not fully sa|tisfyed
for vs, but rather
the contrary, viz, that he
hauing purchased an abso|lute
right and title of pro|priety
in vs, by the infinite
price of his blood pay'd for
our saluation, he graunteth
our pardon with what con|dition,
and vnder what law
and reseruation he pleaseth
to impose.</P>
<P>We should be very vn|gratefull
&amp; iniurious to our
Sauiour, should we presume
to question the infinitenesse
of his merit by this pretext,
that hauing pardoned vs the
sin of Adam, he did not de|liuer
and free vs at the same
tyme from all the conse|quences
of it, leauing vs still
subiect to death, and to so
<PB N="61" REF="41">
many corporal and spiritual
infirmities, vnto which that
sin hath sentenced vs. It is
surely grace enough that IE|SVS-CHRIST
hath once
pay'd the price for which we
shall one day be deliuered
from all the miseries which
oppresse vs; it is our part
to receiue with humility and
gratitude euery part of his
benefit, considering the mo|tion
whereby he is pleased
to carry on our deliuerance
in that order his wisedome
hath designed for our happi|nesse,
and for a more eui|dent
manifestation of his
own Iustice and Mercy.</P>
<P>And for the like reason
we ought not to maruaile
if he who hath giuen vs so
easy a deliuery by Baptisme
<PB N="62" REF="42">
becomes more seuere to vs
after we haue violated our
holy promises, made vpon
that remission; and it is not
only iust, but euen beneficial
to vs, that God forgiving vs
the sin, and remitting the
Eternal punishment we haue
incurr'd, should impose
some temporal penalty to
reteyn vs within our dutyes,
least we being deliuered too
soone from the bonds of his
iustice, we should abandon
our selues vnto a temerari|ous
confidence, abusing the
facility of his Indulgence.</P>
<P>It is therefore in order to
our discharging that obliga|tion
that we are subiected
to some workes of Pen|nance,
which we are bound
to perfome in the spirit of
<PB N="63" REF="42">
humility &amp; repentance; and
the necessity of these satis|factory
workes, was the mo|tiue
that induced the primi|tiue
Church to impose vpon
Penitents those pennances
called Canonical.</P>
<P>So that when the Church
inflicteth vpon sinners payn|full
&amp; laborious iniunctions,
and they vndergoe them
with humility, that act we
call Satisfaction: and when
either in regard of the zeale
and feruor of the Penitent,
or other good workes per|formed,
which the Church
hath prescribed, she releaseth
some part of the Pennance,
which was owing, this re|mission
is call'd Indulgence.</P>
<P>The Councel of Trent pro|poseth
no more to our Faith<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sess. 25. de|cr. de In|dulg,</NOTE>
<PB N="64" REF="43">
then this in point of Indul|gences,
<HI>that the power of gran|ting
them hath bin giuen the
Church by</HI> CHRIST IESVS,
<HI>and that the vse of them is
very beneficial;</HI> whereunto
the Councel addeth; <HI>that
the grant of them ought to be
dispensed with caution, least
the Ecclesiasticall discipline
should be weakned, and ener|uated
by an excessiue facili|ty,</HI>
which aduice declareth
that the manner of dispo|sing
of Indulgences apper|taineth
to Church-disci|pline.</P>
<P>Such as depart out of
this world in Grace &amp; Cha|rity,
but yet owing those
sufferances, which the Di|uine
Justice hath reserued,
discharge them in the next
<PB N="65" REF="43">
life, and this perswasion
hath obliged all the Chris|tian
Antiquity to offer pray|ers,
almes, and sacrifices
for the faithfull departed in
the peace and communion
of the Church, with an assu|red
faith that such suf|ferers
may be eased by these
applications: this is what
the Councel of Trent propo|seth
to be beleeued concer|ning
the soules deteyned in
Purgatory, without deter|mining
the special manner
of their paines, or declaring
any thing vpon many the
like debates, vpon which
the holy Councel aduiseth
a great referuednes, blaming
such as expose what is not
only vncertain, but may be
vnfound.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="44">This is the holy and the
harmelesse Doctrine of the
Catholique Church in point
of Satisfactions: from the
mis-construction whereof so
many wrongfull imputations
have bin cast vpon her; and
if after this explanation the
Pretended-Reformers doe
obiect to vs the detracting
from the satisfaction made
by IESVS-CHRIST, they must
needs haue forgot what we
haue professed to them, that
our Saviour hath pay'd the
entire price of our Redemp|tion,
and that there is no|thing
wanting in the value,
since it is in it self infinite,
and that the reservation of
those payns, we have asser|ted,
proceeds not from any
disproportion in this pay|ment,
but from a certain
<PB N="67" REF="44">
order Christ hath designed, to
restraine vs by iust apprehen|sio~s,
and healthfull discipline.</P>
<P>And in cafe they should
yet obiect to vs the beleefe
that we are sufficient of our
selues to satisfy for some part
of the paine due to our sinns,
we may reply with great
assurance, that the contrary
is manifested by those maxi|mes
we haue established,
since they proclaime cleerly
that our whole Saluation is
but a worke of Grace &amp; Mer|cy:
that what we act by the
Grace of God is no lesse to
be ascribed to him then what
he effecteth singly by his
absolute pleasure:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parum me mouent quae in veterum scriptis de Satisfactio|ne passim oc|currunt; vi|deo quidem eorum non|nullos (di|cam simpli|citer, omnes fer&egrave; quorum libriextant) aut in hac parte lapsos esse, aut ni|mis asper&egrave; ac dur&egrave; lo|cutos. <HI>Calu.

fine whatsoeuer we present

vpon vs: to which we must
<PB N="68" REF="45">
adioyne (in conformity to
the whole ancient Church)
this profession; that what
we terme Satisfaction is but
in effect an application of
the infinite Satisfaction pay'd
by CHRIST IESVS.</P>
<P>This same consideration
ought to appease those who
seeme offended when we af|firme
that fraternal chari|ty,
and the Communion
of Saints is so acceptable to
God, that he doth often re|ceaue
euen the Satisfactions
we offer one for another. It
seemes these Pretending Re|formers
doe not conceaue
how intirely, whatsoeuer
we are, belongs to God,
nor how much all those
regards which his goodnes
produceth in fauour of the
faithful, who are mem|bers
<PB N="69" REF="45">
of CHRIST IESVS
are necessarily relating to
that Divine head. But surely
such as haue read and consi|dered
that God himself in|spired
into his servants the
zeale of afflicting themselues,
by fastings, and other mor|tifications,
not only for their
own sinns, but for those also
of the whole land where they
liued, wil not wonder if we
affirme, that God being mo|ved
by the pleasure he takes,
to gratify those he vouchsa|feth
to call his friends, doth
mercifully accept the hum|ble
Sacrifice of their volun|tary
mortifications for an
abatement of those punish|ments
he had designed for
his criminal poeple: which

his sonne CHRIST

<P><MILESTONE N="IX"> The order of our Doctrine
requireth that we expose in
the next place that of the
Sacraments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sacra|ments.</NOTE> by which the
merits of our Sauiour CHRIST
are apply'd vnto vs. And since
the disputes we haue in rela|tion
to them (excepting that
of the Eucharist or Commu|nion)
are not persued with
much heate, we will in the
first place cleare in few words
the principal difficulties whi|ch
are obiected concerning
the other Sacraments; re|serving
that of the Blessed
<PB N="71" REF="46">
Sacrament for the last, as
the most important.</P>
<P>The Sacraments of the
new Alliance are not simply
holy signes, which doe but
signify the Grace of CHRIST,
nor only seales which con|firme
it, but also instuments
of the holy spirit, which
serve to apply it vnto vs, and
which confer Grace by the
virtue of the words pro|nounced,
and the exteriour
action apply'd vnto vs, in
case we interpose no impe|diment
by our own indispo|sition.</P>
<P>When God annexeth so
great a Grace vnto exteriour
signes, which in their own
nature hold no proportion
with so admirable effects, he
signifieth to vs cleerly, that
<PB N="72" REF="47">
besides what we can confer
to it by our interiour contri|bution,
there is required a
special intervention of the
holy spirit to effect our
sanctification, and a singular
application of our Sauiour's
merits, which are imparted
to vs by the Sacraments.
So that this Doctrine can not
be reiected without iniuring
the Merits of CHRIST JESVS,
and detracting from the effi|cacy
of the diuine power in
our Regeneration.</P>
<P>We acknowledg seauen si|gnes,
or sacred ceremonies
established by CHRIST JESVS,
as the ordinary meanes &amp;
instruments of sanctification
and perfection of the new
man. Their diuine institution
is extant in the holy scripture,
<PB N="73" REF="47">
either by the expresse words
of CHRIST, who established
them; or by that Grace,
which, by testimony of the
same scripture, is annexed
vnto them, and inferreth ne|cessarily
God's ordayning
them.</P>
<P>By reason that infants can
not supply their own want
of Baptisme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baptisme.</NOTE> by the acts of
Faith, Hope, and Charity,
nor by their vows &amp; desire
of receauing this Sacrament,
we beleeue that if they doe
not actually receaue it, they
haue no part of communica|tion
of the Grace of our
Redemption, and conse|quently
dying in Adam,
they haue no part in JESVS-CHRIST.</P>
<P>It is fitt to obserue here,
<PB N="74" REF="48">
that the Lutherans concurr
with the Catholique Church
in holding the absolute ne|cessity
of Baptisme for In|fants,
and withall wonder
that any one hath presumed
to deny a truth, which no
one before Caluin had euer
dared to call in question, so
deeply was it imprinted in
the minds of all the faith|ful.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, the
Pretended-Reformers make
no scruple willfully to lett

doe, without bearing

the end this actual commu|nication
of that adorable
flesh should remayne a per|petual
testimony to euery
one of vs in particular, that
it was for our sakes he assu|med,
and for vs he sacri|ficed
his mortal flesh and
blood.</P>
<P>God had forbiden the Ie|ws
to eate of the Sacrifice<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 span">uit. 6. 30</NOTE>
<PB N="85" REF="53">
which was &agrave; Sin-Offering,
with intent to teach them
that true expiation of crimes
was not obteyned in the
Law, nor by the blood of
beasts. All the poeple stood
as it were interdicted by this
restraint, not being capable
to partake actually of the re|mission
of sinns. Now, for
the quite contrary reason, it
was requisit that the Body of
our Sauiour, the true Host
offer'd vp for sin, should be
eaten by the faithful, in or|der
to the teaching them by
this true eating that the for|giuenes
of sinns was ac|complished
in the New Tes|tament.</P>
<P>God did likewise forbid
the people of the Iews the ea|ting
of blood; and one of
<PB N="86" REF="54">
the reasons of this restraynt
was, <HI>that the blood is giuen
for the expiation of our soules.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuit. 17. 11</NOTE>
Quite contrary our Sauiour
proposeth the drinking of his
Blood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 26. 28.</NOTE> <HI>because it is shed for
the remission of sinns.</HI> So that
the eating of the Flesh &amp; drin|king
the Blood of the Sonne
of God at the holy table is
as Reall, as Grace, the ex|piation
of sinns, and the
participation of the Sacrifice
of CHRIST IESVS is actual
and effectiue in the New
Alliance:</P>
<P>Notwithstanding which
truth, by reason he intended
to exercise our Faith in this
Mystery, and at the same
time to deliuer vs from the
horror of eating his Flesh,
and drinking his Blood in
<PB N="87" REF="54">
their own kinds, it was fit
and convenient to exhibite
them unto us couered under
an other species. But if these
considerations did oblige him
to ordaine our eating the Flesh
of our Offring in a different
manner from that of the Iews,
yet he ought not in that
respect to depriue vs of the
Reality and the Substance of
it.</P>
<P>It is apparent therefore that
to accomplish the figures of
the old Law, and to putt vs
in actual possession of that
Victime offred for our sinns,
CHRIST IESVS did designe
the giving vs Realy &amp; truly
his Body and Blood; which
point is so euident, that our
Aduersaries themselues de|sire
we should be perswa|ded,
<PB N="88" REF="55">
they haue the same be|leefe
as we professe, since they
doe continually presse &amp; vrge
to vs, their not denying
the true and Real participa|tion
of the Body and Blood
of CHRIST in the Eucharist;
which pretence of theirs we
will examine in the sequent
discourse where we con|ceave
it will be proper to
expose their sentiments,
after hauing fully explicated
the beleefe of the Church.
In the meane tyme we may
conclude, that if the faire and
natural signification of the
words, vsed by the sonne of
God compelleth them to
graunt that his expresse in|tention
was to giue Really
his Flesh when he said, <HI>This
is my body,</HI> they ought not
<PB N="89" REF="55">
to wonder, that we can not
consent to the vnderstanding
these words as spoken meer|ly
in a figuratiue sense.</P>
<P>And surely the sonne of
God who was so carefull to
explaine to his Apostles what
he taught vnder the vailes
of parables and figures, ha|uing
said nothing in this
point to explaine himself
further, seemes cleerly to
haue left these words in their
natural signification. I know
that our Aduersaries pre|tend,
that the matter it self
explains sufficiently the mea|ning,
because, say they, it
is cleer that what he expo|seth,
is but Bread and Wyne;
but the cloude of this argu|ment
vanisheth, when we
reflect that he who speaketh
<PB N="90" REF="56">
is of an Authority which
ought to ouerrule our senses,
&amp; hath an Omnipote~ce trans|cending
all nature. It is no
harder for the sonne of God
to effect his body's presence
in the Eucharist, saying,
<HI>This is my body,</HI> then to cure
a woman of her infirmity
by saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 13. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Woman thou art
freed from thy infirmity;</HI> or
to preserue the Centurion's
sonne by saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. 4. 50.</NOTE> <HI>Thy sonne
liueth;</HI> or in fine to effect
the forgiuenes of the sinns
of the bed-rid paralytique by
uttering only,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 9. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Thy sinns are
forgiuen thee.</HI></P>
<P>We hauing therefore no
reason to trouble our selues
how CHRIST will effect what
he saith, we fix our beleefe
precisely on his words. He
who makes whatsoeuer he
<PB N="91" REF="56">
willeth, by his words,
effecteth whatsoeuer he saith;
and it was much easier for
the sonne of God to force
the laws of nature to veri|fy
his word, then it is for
vs to conforme our vnder|standings
vnto such violent
&amp; strayn'd interpretations,
as destroy all the laws of
discourse.</P>
<P>The laws of language and
discourse tell vs that the
signe which naturally repre|senteth,
doth very often
take the name of the thing
it self, because it is natural
to it to recall the idea or
image of it into the mind.
The same hapens to signes
by institution; but then it is
vpon condition that they be
receiued and acknowledged
for signes, and that the par|ties
<PB N="92" REF="57">
be accustomed to them.
But that in instituting a signe,
which of it self hath no rap|port
to the thing, (as for
example a peece of bread to
signify the body of a man)
one should giue it that name
without explaining of it, and
before agreement made con|cerning
it, as JESVS-CHRIST
our Lord did in the last sup|per,
is a thing vnhear'd of,
and whereof we finde no
example in holy scripture,
and I might say, none in hu|mane
language.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Preten|ding
Reformers themselues
doe not so fixe vpon the fi|guratiue
sense which they
ascribe to the words of
CHRIST JESVS, as not to ack|nowledge
at the same time,
that when he vttered those
<PB N="93" REF="57">
words, he intended to giue
vs Truly his Body and his
Blood.</P>
<P>After hauing proposed the <MILESTONE N="XI">
sense of the Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Explicati|on of the words,</HI> doe this in re|membra~ce of me.</NOTE> tou|ching
these words, <HI>This is my
body,</HI> it is fitt to exhibite her
perswasion concerning the
words which CHRIST did
adioyne vnto them, <HI>Doe this
in remembrance of me.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 22. 19.</NOTE> It is
euident that the intention
of the sonne of God was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11. 24</NOTE>
to oblige vs by these words,
vnto a retention and remem|brance
of the death he had
suffered for our redemption;
and S. Paul concludeth out
of these very words, that
<HI>we announce the death of
our Lord</HI> in this mystery:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11. 26.</NOTE> we
must not then perswade our
selues, that this remembrance
of the death of our Lord
<PB N="94" REF="58">
excludeth the Reall presence
of his Body, but quite
contrary, if we consider right|ly
what we haue here ex|plicated,
we shall discerne
cleerly that this Commemo|ration
is grounded vpon the
Reall presence; for in the
same manner as the Iews
eating of the Peace-Offe|rings
did reflect that they
had bin offer'd vp for them,
so we eating the Flesh of
CHRIST JESVS our Victime,
are bound to remember, that
he suffered death for vs. It
is therefore the very same
Flesh eaten by the faithfull,
which not only reuiueth in
vs the memory of his immo|lation,
but doth besides con|firme
to vs that verity. And
we are so farr from hauing
<PB N="95" REF="58">
reason to say that this so|lemne
Com~emoration IESVS-CHRIST
hath ordained vs
to make, doth exclude the
Reall presence of his Flesh,
that the contrary is euident,
that this tender reflexion he
would haue vs make at the
holy table on him, as offered
vp for vs, is grounded vpon
his Flesh's being Really re|ceaued,
since in effect it is
not possible for vs to forget,
that he hath giuen his Body
vp in sacrifice for vs, when
we finde that he continueth
still to giue vs dayly <HI>that
victime</HI> for our orall mandu|cation.</P>
<P>Shall Christians vpon pre|tence
of celebrating in the
Supper the Memory of our
Sauiour's Passion, retrench
<PB N="96" REF="59">
from this pious Commemo|ration
that part which is the
most affectiue and most effi|cacious
therein? Ought they
not consider, that CHRIST
IESVS doth not command
that we should barely re|member
him, but that we
should remember him by
feeding on his Flesh and
Blood? Lett vs reflect vpon
the consequence, and power|fulnes
of the words: Christ
saith not simply, as the Pre|tending
Reformers seeme to
vnderstand him, that the
Bread and the Wine of the
Eucharist should be a <HI>Me|morial</HI>
of his Body and
Blood: but the telleth vs that
in doing what he prescribed,
that is, in taking his Body
and his Blood we should be
<PB N="97" REF="59">
Mindful of him. And can
there be any thing in effect
more powerful to produce
in vs the remembrance of it?
If children reflect so ten|derly
vpon their father and
his kindenes when they ap|proach
the tombe where his
body is enclosed; how power|fully
ought our loue and
memory to be excited and
indeared, when we possesse
vnder those sacred couerings,
and vnder that mystical tom|be,
the Flesh it self of our Sa|uiour
immolated for vs, that
liuing and life-giuing Flesh,
and this Blood still war|me
by the feruor of his loue,
and full of spirit and grace.
If our Aduersaries persist to
alledge, that he who com|mandeth
vs to remember
<PB N="98" REF="60">
him, doth not giue us his
proper Substance; we may
desire them to agree amongst
themselues. They professe
not to deny the Reall com|munication
of the proper
Substance of the sonne of God
in the Blessed Sacrament; if
their profession be serious, if
their Doctrine be not a meere
delusion, they must needs
auowe with vs, that Re|membrance
doth not ex|clude
all manner of Presence,
but only that which moueth
the senses, and so their ans|wer
is the same with ours,
since when we affirme that
IESVS-CHRIST is present,
we accord at the same time
that he is not existing in a sen|sible
manner.</P>
<P>And if we are ask'd, the
reason (we beleeuing, as
<PB N="99" REF="60">
we doe, that there is nothing
to satisfy our senses in this
mystery) why we doe not
grant, that it is sufficient
CHRIST IESVS should be
present in it by our Faith; we
may very easily answer, &amp; cle|are
this equivocal demande.
It is one thing to say that the
son~e of God is present to vs by
Faith; and an other to say,
that we know by Faith that he
is present. The first manner of
speaking imports only a Mo|ral
presence, the second doth
signify a very Reall one, be|cause
our Faith is most cer|taine,
and this Reall presen|ce,
known by our Faith, suf|ficeth
to worke in the <HI>iust
who liueth by Faith</HI> all the
effects which I haue specified.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habac. 2. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>But to defeate at once all
<PB N="100" REF="61">
<MILESTONE N="XII"> the equiuocations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exposition of the Cal|uinists do|ctrine about the Reallity.</NOTE> vnder
which the Caluinists couer
their opinions in this point,
and to discouer at the same
time how neere they appro|ach
to vs, although I haue
vndertaken only to deliuer
and explicate the Doctrine of
the Catholique Church, it
will not be amisse here to in|sert
theirs.</P>
<P>Their Doctrine is deuided
into two partys or sects: the
one speaks only of the Figure
of the Body and Blood: the
other of nothing but the Re|ality
of them both; we shall
examine in their due orders
each one of these different
parties.</P>
<P>In the first place they al|ledge
that this great miracle
of the Reall presence, which
we admit, is no way need|ful:
<PB N="101" REF="61">
that it sufficeth for our
saluation, that IESVS-CHRIST
dyed for vs, that
this Sacrifice is sufficiently
apply'd by our Faith; and this
application is fully certified
by the word of God: they
and further, that if this word
ought to be cloath'd with
sensible signes, the giuing vs
simple and bare Symboles,
such as water in Baptisme,
would haue bin sufficie~t, with|out
the necessity of drawing
down from heauen the Body
and Blood of CHRIST IE|SVS.</P>
<P>Nothing seemes more easy
then after this manner to
explicate the Sacrament of
the Lord's-Supper, and yet
our Aduersaries themselues
haue not iudged that they
<PB N="102" REF="62">
ought to rest and acquiesce
in this exposition. They know
that the like imaginations
haue drawn the Socinians
to deny the miracle of the In|carnation.
Those Heretiques
alledge that God could haue
saued vs without going so farre
about; he had nothing to doe
but forgiue our sinns; he
could haue instructed vs suf|ficiently
both in point of
Doctrine and Manners, by
the Words, and by the Exam|ple
of a man fill'd with the
holy Ghost, without being
obliged for that effect to
make a God of him. But the
Caluinists, as well as we,
haue discern'd the weake|nesse
of this argument, which
is euident; first, by reason
that it is not our part to de|ny
<PB N="103" REF="62">
or assure the mysteries of
Religion according to our
own iudgment of their being
vsefull or vnnecessary for our
saluation. God alone is pos|sess'd
of the secret, and our
part is the rendring them
profitable and beneficiall to
vs, by beleeuing them such
as God promiseth them, and
in receauing his graces and
fauours in the same manner
as he bestoweth them. Se|condly,
without entring into
this question, whether it was
possible for God to saue vs
by any other meanes then
the Incarnation and Death of
his sonne, and embroyling
vs in that vselesse dispute
(which the Pretending Re|formers
debate so teadiously
in their schooles) it sufficeth
<PB N="104" REF="63">
to haue learnt by the holy
scriptures, that the sonne of
God hath bin pleased to de|monstrate
his loue by effects,
which to vs are incompre|hensible.
This loue was the
motiue of that so Reall v|nion,
by which he made him|self
Man. This loue perswa|ded
him to immolate and
offer vp for vs his body as
Really as he assumed it. All
these designes are conse|quent
to one an other, and
this infinite loue holds the
same height throughout all
the strayns &amp; motions there|of.
So that when he shall
be pleased to bring each sin|gle
child of his (by vniting
himself to him particularly)
to tast and partake the good|nesse,
which he hath express'd
<PB N="105" REF="63">
to all in generall, he will
find meanes to accomplish
his will by things as power|full
and efficacious as those
which he hath already ful|fill'd
for our saluation. We
ought not therefore to won|der
at his giuing vnto euery
one of vs the Reall Substance
of his Flesh and Blood.
He intends by it to imprint
in our harts this verity, that
it was for our sakes that he
assumed them, and offered
them vp in Sacrifice. This
preceding goodnes renders
all the sequence easy to be
beleeued; the order of his
mysteries disposeth vs to cre|dit
all this, and his expresse
word doth not allow vs any
doubt of it.</P>
<P>Our Aduersaries did well
<PB N="106" REF="64">
discerne that simple figures
and bare signes of the Body
and Blood would not satisfy
Christians vsed &amp; accustomed
to the Grace and Goodnesse
of a God, who giues himself so
Really to vs. So that vpon
this ground they seeke to de|cline
the being taxed with
their denying a Substantiall
and Reall participation of
IESVS-CHRIST in the Com|munion.
They affirme with
vs, that he makes vs parta|kers
of his <HI>proper Substance.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cat. Dim. 53.</NOTE>
They say that <HI>he feedeth vs
with the Substance of his Bo|dy
and his Blood:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conf. of faith. art. 36.</NOTE> and con|ceauing
that his shewing vs
by some signe that we did
partake of his Sacrifice would
not be sufficient, they de|clare
expressely, that the Bo|dy
<PB N="107" REF="64">
of our Sauiour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cat. Dim. 52.</NOTE> which is
giuen vs in the Communion,
doth ascertaine vs of it. These
words are so important, as
we will presently examine
them.</P>
<P>Now then we see the Bo|dy
and Blood of CHRIST
present in our Mysteries, by
the grant of the Caluinists:
for what is communicated
according to the proper Sub|stance
of it, must needs be
Really present. True it is
that they explaine this Com|munication,
saying it is effe|cted
by the Spirit and by
Faith; but it is also certain
that they will haue it to be
Reall: and because it is not
possible to render this intel|ligible,
that a Body commu|nicated
to vs only in Spirit
<PB N="108" REF="65">
&amp; by Faith, should be impar|ted
to vs Really and in its
proper Substance, they haue
not bin able to remain fix'd
in both parts of a Doctrine
of such a Contradiction; and
so they haue bin forced to
grant two things, which the
Catholique Church teacheth.
The first is, that CHRIST
IESVS is giuen vs in the
Eucharist in such a manner
as doth not sute either with
Baptisme, or Preaching the
Gospel, but is peculiarly
proper to this Mysterie. We
shall discerne presently the
consequence of this princi|ple,
but lett vs first consider,
how it is allowed &amp; granted
by the Pretended-Refor|mers.</P>
<P>And in this point I will
<PB N="109" REF="65">
not alledge the testimony of
any particular Authour, but
the very words of the Cate|chisme
in that place, where
it explicateh what relateth
to the Lord's-Supper. It pro|nounceth
in expresse termes
not only that CHRIST IESVS
is giuen vs Really and truly
in the Sacrament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dim. 53.</NOTE> and <HI>in his
own Substance</HI> but being as|ked
the question, what ad|uantage
we haue by the com|munication
in the Supper,
aboue that in Baptisme or
Preaching, they answer;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dim. 52.</NOTE> <HI>al|though
he be truly communi|cated
to vs by Baptisme, and
by the Gospel, yet in them it
is but Partly, and not Enti|rely.</HI>
From whence it followes,
that in the Lord's-Supper
they teach he is not giuen vs
<PB N="110" REF="66">
Partly but Compleatly.</P>
<P>There is an extreame dif|ference
between receauing
in Part, and receauing Plena|rily.
So that if we partake
of JESVS-CHRIST in all other
com~unications of him, but in
Part, and that in the Lord's
Supper singly, we receaue
him Entirely, it followeth
euen by the Confession of
our Aduersaries, that we
must seeke in the Commu|nion
a participation special
and peculiar to this mystery,
which can not appertaine to
Baptisme or Preaching: and
at the same time it followes
also that this partaking is not
annexed vnto Faith, since
our Faith spreading &amp; exten|ding
it self through all the
acts of Christianity doth exist
<PB N="111" REF="66">
and operate in the Preaching
of the word, and in Baptisme
as well as the Lord's-Supper.
And indeed it is to be ob|serued,
that notwithstanding
all the earnestnesse the Pre|tending-Reformers
haue ex|pressed
to render Baptisme
and Preaching equal to the
Eucharist, vpon this account;
that CHRIST JESVS is truly
com~unicated to vs by them,
they neuer durst venture to
assert in their Catechismes,
that CHRIST was giuen vs
in his proper Substance ei|ther
in Baptisme, or in Prea|ching
of the Gospel, as they
haue affirm'd it of the Eu|charist.
So that they haue
bin conuinced they could not
decline the ascribing to the
Lord's Supper such a manner
<PB N="112" REF="67">
of possessing CHRIST, as is
peculiar to this Sacrament,
and that our Faith, which is
common to all the actions
of a Christian, could not be
that distinct &amp; singular man|ner.
Now this singular man|ner
of possessing CHRIST
IESVS in the Eucharist must
needs be Reall, since it gi|ueth
to the beleeuer the ve|ry
Substance of the Body
and Blood of our Sauiour,
which is not done by Faith,
and this is what the Ca|tholique
Church holds &amp;
teacheth.</P>
<P>The second point granted
by the Pretending Refor|mers
is drawn from the Ar|ticle
following immediately
what I haue allready cited
out of their Catechisme,
<PB N="113" REF="67">
which is this, <HI>that the Body
of our Sauiour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dim. 52.</NOTE> <HI>in regard it
was once offer'd in Sacrifice
to reconcile vs vnto God, is now
giuen vs to assure vs that we
partake of that reconciliation.</HI></P>
<P>If these words haue any
meaning in them, if they are
not an empty sound only, &amp;
a meere vaine amusement,
they must needs suggest to our
vnderstanding that CHRIST
JESVS doth not giue vs a
simple signe or symbole, but
his proper Body, to assure
vs that we partake of his
Sacrifice, and the Reconci|liation
of Mankind. If then
the receauing of the Body
of our Sauiour assureth vs
of our participation of the
fruite of his Death, it fol|lowes
of necessity that this
<PB N="114" REF="68">
partaking of the fruite must
be a distinct thing, from the
receauing of his Body, be|cause
the one is the pledge
and security for the other;
from which supposal aduan|cing
further, I say that if
our Aduersaries are forced
to distinguish in the Lord's-Supper
the partaking of the
Body of our Sauiour, from
the hauing part in the fruite
and grace of his Sacrifice,
they ought likewise to distin|guish
the participation of
that Diuine Body from all
that participation thereof,
which is conferr'd Spiritual|ly
and by Faith; for this last
partaking (namely by Faith)
will neuer afford them two
distinct actions, by one of
which they receaue the Bo|dy
<PB N="115" REF="68">
of our Sauiour, and by
the other the fruite of his
Sacrifice; no body being able
to conceaue what difference
there is between partaking,
by Faith, of the Body of
our Sauiour, &amp; partaking,
by Faith, of the fruite of his
Death. They must therefore
yeald that besides the Com|munion
by which we par|take
Spiritually of the Body
of our Sauiour, and of his
spirit coniointly in the recea|uing
the fruite of his Death,
there is yet an other Reall
Comunion of the Body of the
same Sauiour, which is a se|cure
pledge to vs that the
other (namely the benefit of
his death) is assured to vs, if
we doe not frustrate the ef|fects
of so great a grace, by
our own opposite dispositi|ons.
<PB N="116" REF="69">
This consequence is ne|cessarily
included in the prin|ciples
to which they agree;
nor can they euer be able to
explicate this verity in any
solide way, vnlesse they re|turne
to the sense of the Ca|tholique
Church.</P>
<P>Who can choose but ad|mire
in this point the power
of Truth? All that is conse|quent
to the principles gran|ted
by our Aduersaries is
cleerly vnderstood in the sense
of the Church: euen the
least instructed Catholiques
easily conceaue that in the
Eucharist there is a Com~unio~
with CHRIST IESVS,
which is not to be found
any where else. It is easy for
them to vnderstand that his
Body <HI>is giuen vs, to assure vs
<PB N="117" REF="69">
that we partake in his Sacri|fice,
and in his Death.</HI> They
distinguish cleerly these two
manners necessary to vnite
vs to CHRIST IESVS; the one
is by taking his proper Flesh;
the other by receauing his
Spirit: the first thereof is
granted vs as a pledge and
security of the second: but
by reason things can not be
explicated in the opinions
held by our Aduersaries,
though on the other side they
can not disauowe them, we
can not choose but conclude
that their Error hath cast
them into a manifest Contra|diction.</P>
<P>I haue often wondred why
they did not deliuer and ex|plaine
their Doctrine in a
more familiar and simple
<PB N="118" REF="70">
manner. Why haue they not
persisted in saying (without
so many artifices) that
CHRIST IESVS hauing shed
his blood for vs, had re|presented
to vs this effusion,
by giuing vs two distinct
signes of his Body and his
Blood; and that he had bin
pleased to giue to these two
signes the names of the thing
it self; and that these sacred
Symbols were pledges and
securities of our partaking
the fruite of his death; and
that we were nourished spi|ritually
by the virtue of his
Body and Blood: after hauing
strayned so hard to proue
that the signes receaue the
name of the thing it self,
and that for this reason the
signe of the Body may be
<PB N="119" REF="70">
call'd the Body, the whole
frame of this Doctrine did
oblige them naturally to set|tle
and rest there. And to
render these signes effica|tious,
it would serue suffi|ciently
to haue the grace of
our Redemption annexed to
them; or rather, according
to their principles, that it
were confirmed to vs in
them. They needed not to
haue troubled themselues so
much, as they haue done, to
gett vs to conceaue that we
receaue the very Body of our
Sauiour, to this end only, viz,
to assure vs that we partake
of the Grace of his Death.
These Pretended-Reformers
did content themselues with
hauing in the water of Bap|tisme
<PB N="120" REF="71">
a signe of the Blood
which cleanseth vs, and they
neuer thought of saying, that
we receaue the Substance it
self of our Sauiour's Blood,
to ascertaine us that the vir|tue
thereof is therein diffused
vpon vs. If they had argued,
and concluded so in the
matter of the Eucharist,
their Doctrine would haue
bin easier and lesse incombe|red
with Contradictions. But
they who inuent and inno|uate
can not say all they
haue a minde to: they en|counter
apparent verities,
and establish'd maximes,
which disapoint them, and
oblige them to restrayne their
own conceptions. The Arians
would haue wisht, not to
haue bin obliged to qualify
<PB N="121" REF="71">
our Sauiour with the name
of God and his only Sonne.
The Nestorians did admit
but with great constraint a
kinde of Unity of Persons in
CHRIST JESVS, which
we finde in their writings.
The Pelagians who denyed
Originall sin, would as wil|lingly
haue reiected the mi|nistring
the Sacrame~t of Bap|tisme
to Infants in order to
the remission of sin, by which
meanes they would haue bin
deliuered from that argu|ment
the Catholiques drew
from this practise, to proue
Originall sin. But, as I come
from obseruing, they who
finde a thing firmely establish|ed
haue not the boldnes, or
rather impudence, to ouer|throw
all at once. Let the
<PB N="122" REF="72">
Caluinists auowe ingenuously
the truth; they would haue
bin very willing to haue ac|knowleged
in the Eucharist
the Body of IESVS-CHRIST
meerly Figuratiuely, and the
partaking only of his spirit.
in effect, setting a side those
big words of partaking of his
proper Substance, and many
others, which import a Reall
Presence, and doe but in|tricate
&amp; perplexe them. It
would haue suted better to
their mindes, not to haue
confessed any other Commu|nion
with CHRIST JESVS in
the Lord's-Supper, then such
an one as is imparted in
Preaching the Word, and in
Baptisme, without telling vs,
as they doe, that in the Eu|charist
CHRIST is receaued
<PB N="123" REF="72">
<HI>Intierly</HI> and elsewhere only
<HI>in Part.</HI> But though this was
their wish and inclination, yet
the powerfulnes of the termes
resisted their profession of it,
our Sauiour hauing affirmed
so positiuely of the Eucharist,
This is my Body; This is my
Blood; which he never said
of any other thing, nor in
any other occasion. And
what appearence of rendring
that common to all the ac|tions
of a Christian, which
his expresse word hath an|nexed
specially to one par|ticular
Sacrament? Besides,
the whole order of the diui|ne
counsels, the conne|xion
of the holy mysteries,
of the doctrine and inten|tion
of CHRIST IESVS in
his last supper, the words
<PB N="124" REF="73">
themselues which he vsed,
and the impression they na|turally
make in the minds of
the faithfull; all these sug|gest
nothing but images and
notions of Reality: and for
this reason our Aduersaries
haue bin faine to finde out
some words, the sound where|of,
at least, might raise some
confused idea of this Reali|ty.
When a man fastens him|self
either intirely vnto
Faith, as the Catholiques
doe, or absolutely rest on
humane Reason, as the Infi|dels
doe, one may establish
firme consequences, and
make, as it were, an vnifor|me
draught or designe of
Doctrine: but when one will
frame a compound of them
both together, one is driuen
<PB N="125" REF="73">
to say somewhat more then
he would willingly doe, and
in the persuite, to fall into
opinions, the apparent Con|tradictions
whereof manifest|ly
discouer their Falsities.</P>
<P>This is the case of the Pre|tended-Reformers,
and God
hath permitted their delu|ding
themselues in this man|ner,
to facilitate their retur|ne
to the Vnity of the Ca|tholique
doctrine. For since
their own experience con|uinceth
them that they must
speake as we doe, to speake
the language of truth, ought
they not to iudge they must
thinke as we doe to vnder|stand
it right? If they ob|serue
in their own beleefe
some things that can haue no
sense but in ours, is not this
<PB N="126" REF="74">
sufficient to conuince them,
that the Truth is not intire
&amp; compleate but in our
Church? And those loose
parts of Catholique doctrine
which are scattered here and
there in their Catechisme
(but would, as one may say,
faine be reunited to their
whole body) ought not they
perswade them to seeke in
the Com~union of the Church
the full &amp; intire explication
of the Mysterie of the Eu|charist?
They would certain|ly
be brought to it, did not
humane reasonings trouble
&amp; perplex their Faith, which
is too much adhering to their
senses. But now after hauing
represented to them what
benefit they may draw from
the exposition of their Do|ctrine,
<PB N="127" REF="74">
let vs proceed and
end the explaining of our
own.</P>
<P>Since it was convenient (as <MILESTONE N="XIII">
hath bin obserued before)
that our senses should dis|cerne
nothing in this myste|ry
of Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Transub|stannation, &amp; Adorati|on; and in what sense the Eucharist is said to be a Signe.</NOTE> it was requisit
there should be no alteratio~,
as to their obiect, in the
Bread &amp; Wine of the Eucha|rist.
Whereupon by reason
that the same species conti|nue
as our obiect, and we
feele the same effects in the
Sacrament, as were sensible
before the Consecration, we
ought not to wonder if some
times, and in some certain
sense, it is express'd by the
same name. Neuerthelesse our
Faith being attentiue to his
word, who effecteth what
<PB N="128" REF="75">
euer he pleaseth in heauen
and on earth, doth acknow|ledg
in this case no other
Substance remaining, but
that which is designed by the
same word, viz the proper
Body and Blood of CHRIST
IESVS into which the Bread
and the Wine are changed,
which is what we terme
TRANSVBSTANTIATION.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding this,
yet the Reality which the
Eucharist contains, in regard
of the interiour part, is no
impediment to the being a
Signe in respect of what it re|tains
of exteriour and sensi|ble:
but yet a Signe of such
a nature as is so farre from
excluding a Reality, as it
carieth it of necessity along
with it, since in effect this
<PB N="129" REF="75">
speech <HI>This is my Body</HI> being
pronounced vpon the matter
CHRIST IESVS hath cho|sen,
is an assured signe, that
he is Present, and although
the matters seeme to our
senses to remayne the same,
yet our spirit iudgeth other|wise
of them then it would
doe, if a superiour Authori|ty
did not interuene: so that
although those species, and
a certaine sequence of natu|rall
impressions, which are
made on our bodies, are vsed
to suggest to vs the Substance
of Bread &amp; Wine, yet in this
case his Authority, whome
we beleeue intirely, preuai|les
so much vpon vs, that
the same species begin to de|signe
to vs an other Substance;
for we beleeue CHRIST
<PB N="130" REF="76">
who sayth, <HI>that which we
take, and that which we eate
is his Body;</HI> and such is the
efficacy of his word, as it
keeps vs from ascribing to
the Substance of Bread these
exteriour appearances, and
moueth vs to referr them to
the Body of CHRIST being
present vnder them, so that
the presence of so Adorable
an obiect being once ascer|tain'd
to vs by this signe, we
make no question of offring
to it our Adorations.</P>
<P>I doe not enter into the point
of Adoration, by reason that
the most learned and sober
of our Aduersaries haue long
since granted vs, that the pre|sence
of CHRIST IESVS in
the Eucharist ought to im|pose
Adoration vpon those
who are of that perswasion.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="76">In fine being once conuin|ced
that the omnipotent
words of the sonne of God
effect whatsoeuer they pro|nounce,
we beleeue vpon
good grounds that in the last
Supper they produced their
effect as soone as they were
vttered, and vpon a necessary
consequence we acknowledg
the Reall presence of the
Body before our receauing it.</P>
<P>These preceeding points <MILESTONE N="XIV">
being supposed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacrifice of the Masse.</NOTE> the Sacrifice,
which we assert and maintain
in the Eucharist, retayns no
longer any particular diffi|culty.</P>
<P>We haue obserued two
actions in this Mystery, which
cease not to be distinct, al|though
the one relateth to
the other: the first is the
<PB N="132" REF="77">
Consecration, by which the
Bread and Wine are changed
into the Body and Blood:
the second is the Eating, by
which we communicate and
partake of them.</P>
<P>In the Consecration the
Body and Blood are mysti|cally
separated by reason that
CHRIST IESVS said seuerally,
<HI>This is my Body, This is my
Blood;</HI> the which includeth
a liuely and effectuall repre|sentation
of the violent death
he suffered.</P>
<P>And so the sonne of God
is sett vpon the holy table,
by vertue of those words,
couered with signes that re|present
his death&punc; This is
what is effected by Conse|cration,
and this Religious
act carieth with it, the pro|testation
<PB N="133" REF="77">
of the Soueragnity
of God, by reason that
CHRIST IESVS being pre|sent
reneweth, and in some
sort perpetuates the memo|ry
of his obedience, euen
to the death of the Crosse;
so that indeed there is no|thing
wanting here, towards
the rendring it a True Sa|crifice.</P>
<P>Without all question this
Religious act, as it is distinct
from that of the Communi|on,
must needs be of it self
acceptable to God, and must
inuite him to looke vpon vs
with a more fauorable and
propitious eye, by reason it
presenteth to his sight the
voluntary death which his
wellbeloued sonne hath suf|fer'd
for sinners, or rather
<PB N="134" REF="78">
replaceth before his eyes
euen his own sonne, vnder
the signes of that death,
whereby he hath bin appea|sed,
and reconciled to Man.</P>
<P>All Christians confesse that
the single prese~ce of CHRIST
IESVS is a most powerfull
manner of Intercession be|fore
God for all mankind,
according to this saying of
the Apostle, CHRIST IESVS
<HI>presenteth himself and appea|reth
for vs before the face of
God:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 9. 24</NOTE> and thereupon we be|leeue
that CHRIST IESVS
being present vpon the holy
table in this figure of death
intercedeth for vs, and re|presenteth
continually to his
Father the death he hath suf|fered
for his Church.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="78">It is in this sense we affir|me,
that IESVS-CHRIST
offereth himself for vs to
God in the Eucharist; and
in this manner it is we con|ceaue
that this Oblation in|uiteth
God to become more
fauorable and propitious to
vs, and for this reason we
call it Propitiatorie.</P>
<P>When we reflect vpon
what CHRIST IESVS
worketh in this mystery,
and when we looke vpon
him, by our Faith, as actu|ally
present vpon the holy
table with the signes of death,
we ioine our selues to him
in that estate, and we present
him to God as our only
Victime, and as our sole Pro|pitiator
by the merit of his
Blood, protesting that we
<PB N="136" REF="79">
haue nothing to offer vnto
God but IESVS-CHRIST, and
the infinite merit of his
death. We consecrate all our
prayers by this Diuine Obla|tion,
and by our presenting
CHRIST IESVS to God,
we are taught to offer vp
our selues at the same time
to the Diuine Maiesty, in
him, and by him, as liuing
Sacrifices.</P>
<P>Such is the Sacrifice of
Christians, and infinitely
differing from that which was
practised in the Law, being
a Spirituall Sacrifice, &amp; wor|thy
of the New Couenant,
wherein the presence of the
Victime is not perceaued but
by Faith; where the word
of God is the instrument
that separateth Mystically
<PB N="137" REF="79">
the Body &amp; the Blood, and
co~sequently where the Blood
is shed but Mystically, and
where death interueneth but
by Representation; and yet
a most Reall &amp; True Sacrifice
for this reason that CHRIST
JESVS is truly contained, and
presented to God in it, vn|der
this figure of death, and
therefore a Sacrifice also of
Commemoration; which is
so farre (though obiected)
from parting &amp; loosening vs
from our application to the
Sacrifice of the Crosse, as it fi|xeth
vs the faster, by all its cir|cu~stances,
vnto it, since it doth
not only relate intirely vnto
it, but in effect it hath nei|ther
being nor subsistance but
by this relation, from when|ce
it deriueth all the virtue
it contains.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="80">This is the expresse Do|ctrine
of the Catholique
Church in the Councel of
Trent, which teacheth, that
this Sacrifice is instituted
only <HI>to the intent of represen|ting
that,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sess. 22. c. 1.</NOTE> <HI>which was once
perfected vpon the Crosse; and
to preserue the Memory of it
vnto the end of all ages, and
apply vnto vs that sauing vir|tue
for the forgiuenes of sinns
which we dayly commit.</HI>
Wherefore so farre we are
from beleeving that some|what
is wanting to the Sacri|fice
of the Crosse, as quite
contrary, the Church holds,
that it was so perfect, and so
fully sufficient, as all which
followes it, is but ordain'd
in order to the celebrating
the Memory, and applying
<PB N="139" REF="80">
the Virtue of that Oblation.</P>
<P>Whereby the same Church
professeth, that all the merit
of the Redemption of man|kind
is annexed to the
Death of the son~e of God; &amp;
certainly by all that hath bin
already said, it ought to haue
bin vnderstood, that when
we say to God in the cele|bration
of the divine Myste|ries,
<HI>We offer you this holy
host,</HI> we doe not pretend by
this oblation to make, or
present to God a new paye|ment
of the price of our Sal|uation,
but to employ to|wards
him the merits of IESVS
CHRIST there present, and
the infinite price he hath at
once pay'd for our Redemp|tion
vpon the Crosse.</P>
<P>The Professors of the Pre|tended-Reformed
<PB N="140" REF="81">
Religion
doe not beleeue that they
offend CHRIST IESVS in
offring him to God, as pre|sent
by their Faith: as in
case they did beleeue he were
truly and Really present,
what repugnance could they
haue to offer him as being
Effectually present? So that
to argue ingenuously, the
dispute in faire dealing ought
to be reduced singly to his
being Present.</P>
<P>This supposed, all the false
images and conceptions,
the Pretended-Reformers
frame to themselues about
the Sacrifice we offer, ought
to be effaced; they should
in iustice acknowledge faire|ly,
that the Catholiques pre|tend
not to frame for them|selues
<PB N="141" REF="81" MS="y">
a new Propitiation to
appease God againe, as if he
were not sufficiently reconci|led
by the Sacrifice of the
Crosse, or in order to make
some new supplement to the
price of our Saluation, as if
it were imperfect. All these
imaginations haue no admis|sion
into our Doctrine, by
reason that all this is intended
by way of Intercession, and
Application in that manner
I come from deliuering &amp;
explaining.</P>
<P>After this cleer explication,<MILESTONE N="XV">
those great obiections drawn
out of the Epistle to the He|brews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Epistle to the He|brews.</NOTE>
which our Aduersaries
seeke to enforce so much
against vs, will appear weake,
&amp; vnreasonable; &amp; that it is in
vaine they strayne themselues
<PB N="142" REF="82">
to proue, by the meaning of
the Apostle, that we nullify the
Sacrifice of the Crosse; but
as the most certain proof that
can be had that two Doctri|nes
are not opposite to one an
other is to discouer, in the
expounding them, that no
proposition of the one is Con|tradictory
to the proposalls
of the other, I conceaue my
self inuited in this occasion
to expose, in short, the Do|ctrine
of the Epistle to the He|brews.</P>
<P>The Apostle designed in
this Epistle the teaching vs,
that a sinner could not escape
from death other wayes, then
by subrogating in his place
one that should dy for him:
that while men did supply,
in their stead, but the Blood|shed
<PB N="143" REF="82">
of Beasts, their Sacri|fices
had no other operation,
but the making a publick pro|fession,
that they had deserued
to dy; and that by reason the
divine Iustice could not be
satisfied with so dispropor|tionate
an exchange, those
Bloody Victimes were euery
day offer'd and repeated,
which was a certain proofe
of the insufficiency of that ex|change
and subrogation: but
that since CHRIST IESVS had
bin pleased to dy for sinners,
God being fully satisfyed by
the voluntary substitution of
so worthy a person, could no
more require the price of
our ransome; from whence
the Apostle concludes, that
we ought not only to cease
from offring any other Victi|me
<PB N="144" REF="83">
after CHRIST IESVS,
but that CHRIST himself
was to be offer'd vp to death
but one single time.</P>
<P>Let the Reader then, who
is sollicitous of his Saluation,
and is a freind to truth, re|colect
seriously what we haue
deliuered of the manner
wherein CHRIST IESVS offe|reth
himself to God for vs in
the Eucharist, and I am con|fident
he will not find in it
any propositions contrary to
those of the Apostle, which
I come from delivering, or
any that infirme his proofes,
so the most can be vrged
against vs is his Silence. But
such as will consider the wise
distributions God maketh of
his secrets in the many and
seuerall bookes of his Scrip|ture,
<PB N="145" REF="83">
would not surely restrai|ne
vs to receaue from the sin|gle
Epistle to the Hebrews
all our instruction concer|ning
a matter, which did not
necessarily relate to the sub|iect
of that Epistle; since the
Apostle intendeth in it to
explaine the perfection of
the Sacrifice of the Crosse,
and not the different meanes
God hath giuen vs to apply
it vnto our selues.</P>
<P>And to preuent all Equi|uocall
sense, if we take the
word <HI>offer,</HI> as it is vnder|stood
in this Epistle, in that
sense which implyeth the
Actual death of the Victime,
we confesse aloud, that IESVS-CHRIST
is no longer offer'd
so, neither in the Eucharist,
nor any where else. But as
<PB N="146" REF="84">
this same word hath a larger
signification in other places of
Scripture, where it is often
said, that one Offereth to
God, what one presenteth
before him, the Church,
which doth not frame her lan|guage
&amp; her doctrine by the
single Epistle to the Hebrews,
but by the whole body of the
Scriptures, doth not scruple
to affirme that CHRIST
JESVS offereth himself to God
in all places where he ap|peareth
for our sakes before
him, and consequently that
he offereth himself vp in the
Eucharist, according to the
expression of the holy Fa|thers
of the Church.</P>
<P>Now to conceaue that this
man~er, wherein CHRIST IESVS
presenteth himself to God,
can at all detract from the
<PB N="147" REF="84">
Sacrifice of the Crosse, is
what can not possibly be in|ferr'd;
vnlesse one will ouer|throw
the whole Scripture,
and especially that Epistle
which they seeke so much
to straine against vs. For by
the same reason we ought to
conclude, that when CHRIST
IESVS vowed himself to God,
<HI>entring into the world,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 10. 5&punc;</NOTE> to sub|stitute
himself instead of tho|se
Victimes, <HI>which were not
pleasing to him,</HI> that he iniured
the action by which he de|uow'd
himself vpo~ the Crosse;
and so,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 9. 24</NOTE> when he <HI>continueth to
appeare for vs before God,</HI> he
detracteth from the Oblation,
<HI>in which he appeared once by
the Immolation of himself;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 9. 26.</NOTE>
and that, <HI>not ceasing to inter|cede
for vs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 7. 25.</NOTE> he accuseth that
<PB N="148" REF="85">
Intercession of Insufficiency,
which he made at his Death
<HI>with so many teares,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 5. 7.</NOTE> <HI>and so
great cryes.</HI></P>
<P>Would not all these infe|rences
be ridiculous? We
must therefore vnderstand,
that CHRIST IESVS, who did
offer vp himself once, to be|come
the humble Victime
of the Diuine iustice, doth
continue still offering him|self
for vs: that the infinite
perfection of the Sacrifice of
the Crosse consisteth in this,
that whatsoeuer preceded it,
as well as what follows it,
are intirely relating vnto it:
that as what preceded, was
its Preparation; so what doth
follow, is its Consummation,
and Application: that true it
is, the payment of the price
of our ransome is not reite|rated,
<PB N="149" REF="85">
by reason it was fully
discharged the first time, but
what Applieth that Redemp|tion,
is incessantly continued
&amp; repeated; and in fine we
must know to distinguish
those acts, which are reite|rated,
as being imperfect,
from such as are perpetuated
as being perfect &amp; necessary.</P>
<P>We coniure the followers
of the Pretended-Refor|med <MILESTONE N="XVI">
Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflection vpon the preceding doctrine.</NOTE> to make some
little reflection vpon what I
haue said concerning the Eu|charist.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the Reall
Presence hath bin the neces|sary
foundation thereof. This
ground-worke is impugn'd
by the Caluinists; there is
no point that is euidently
more important in our Con|trouersies,
<PB N="150" REF="86">
since the question
is of the Reall presence of
CHRIST himself; there is no|thing
our Aduersaries find
more difficult to beleeue; and
there is no Co~trouersy which
setts vs more directly Oppo|site.</P>
<P>In most of our other dis|putes,
when they reflect
calmely vpon them, they find
difficulties grow much eue|ner,
and that very often they
are more offended with the
termes, then with the mat|ters:
but quite contrary in
this subiect we agree best in
the manner of speaking, be|cause
on both sides we heare
the same termes of <HI>Reall
Participation,</HI> and other such
like words; but the more
exactly we enter into the exa|mination,
<PB N="151" REF="86">
the further we find
our selues distant from one
an other, by reason that our
Aduersaries doe not admitt
the consequences of those
verities they haue acknow|leged,
being, as I haue al|ready
said, discouraged and
auerted by the difficulties
which occurr to their senses
and humane reason in those
consequences.</P>
<P>This is therefore, to
speake truly, the most impor|tant
and most difficult of all
our Controuersies, &amp; where|in
we are in effect most re|moued
from one an other.</P>
<P>Neuerthelesse God, hath
bin pleased to suffer that the
Lutherans should remaine as
firmely adhering to the be|leefe
of the Reality as we,
<PB N="152" REF="87">
and hath permitted also that
the Caluinists should auowe,
that this Doctrine hath no
venome in it, that it doth
not subuert the Foundation
of sauing Faith, and that it
ought not to breake the
Communion of Christian fra|ternity.</P>
<P>Let me request the follo|wers
of the Pretended-Re|formed
Religion, who apply
themselues seriously to their
saluation, to reflect atten|tiuely
vpon what course the
Diuine Prouidence taketh to
draw them imperceptibly
neerer vs, and the truth: one
may either intirely dissipate
all the other grounds of their
complaints, or at least re|duce
them to very inconsi|derable
differe~ces by a meere
<PB N="153" REF="87">
expounding them: and in
this particular, which we
could not expect to ouer|come
by this way, they haue
of themselues voyded the
principall difficulty, by de|claring
that this doctrine is
not incompetent with our
Salvation, nor inco~sistent with
the Foundamentalls of Reli|gion.</P>
<P>True it is that the Luthe|rans,
albeit they concurr
with vs in the maine point of
the Reality, doe not embrace
all the consequences thereof:
they ioyne the Bread to the
Body of CHRIST IESVS: some
of them reiect the Adoration;
and they seeme to confesse
the Presence only in the act
of receauing it. But no art or
subtility of their Ministers
<PB N="154" REF="88">
can ever perswade solide &amp;
vnderstanding co~siderers that
accepting the Reality (which
is the most important, and
most difficult point) they
ought not assent vnto the rest
of our proposalls.</P>
<P>Besides, the same Provi|de~ce,
which worketh couert|ly
to draw vs neerer, and
layeth the foundations of
peace &amp; reconciliation in the
midst of all our sharpnesses
and dissentions, hath further
permitted the Caluinists
should allow, that supposing
these words, <HI>This is my Body,</HI>
are to be taken litterally, the
Catholiques argue &amp; co~clude
more consequently then the
Lutherans.</P>
<P>If I doe not repeate the
passages that haue bin so fre|quently
<PB N="155" REF="88">
cited in this subiect,
I shall easily be excused, since
all such as are not very ob|stinate,
will easily graunt us,
that the Reality supposed,
our doctrine is that which fol|lows
by the best conseque~ce.</P>
<P>This is therefore an es|tablished
Truth, that our Do|ctrine
in this point containeth
nothing but the Reality
rightly vnderstood. But we
must not be content with this;
we further intreate the Pre|tending
Reformers to co~sider,
that we doe not employ any
thing to explicate the Sacri|fice

necessarily is included in the
Reall Presence.</P>
<P>If vpon this a question then
be putt to vs, how the Lu|therans,
who beleeue the
<PB N="156" REF="89">
Reality, come notwithsta~ding
to reiect the Sacrifice, which,
according to our Doctrine,
is a consequence of the first;
we answer in a word, that we
must put this Doctrine amo~gst
the other consequences of
the Reall Presence, which
those Lutherans haue not
vnderstood, and which we
haue penetrated much better
then they, by the confession
of the Calvinists themselves.</P>
<P>If our explications per|swade
these last, that our
Doctrine about the Sacrifice
is included in that of the
Reality, they ought to dis|cerne
cleerly, that this Con|trouersy
of the Sacrifice of
the Masse, which filleth so
many volumes, and hath oc|casioned
so many inuectiues,
<PB N="157" REF="89">
should hence forward be re|trenched
from the body of
their Controversies, since
this point retaineth no lon|ger
any peculiar difficulty,
and (which is more impor|tant)
since this Sacrifice,
against which they expresse
so much repugnance, is but
a necessary sequence, &amp; a
naturall explanation of a
Doctrine, which, by their
own concession, hath no Ve|nome
in it. Let them then
examine themselues now,
and after that try in the pre|sence
of God whether they
have as much reason on
their side, as they imagin,
to depart from the Altars,
where their fathers haue bin
nourished with the bread of
life.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="90"><MILESTONE N="XVII"> There remaineth still one
consequence of this Doctrine

that CHRIST IESVS being

is not annexed to the

which is living, and inlive|ning,
by reason of the con|junction

which ground those who
beleeue the Reality, ought

<P>This is the solide founda|tion,
vpon which the Church,
interpreting the precept of
the holy Communion, hath
declared that we may rece|aue
all the Sanctification this
Sacrament conferreth, vnder
one single Species; and if the
Church hath reduced her
children to this one Species, it
was not out of disesteeme of
the other, since it proceeded
from a quite co~trary motiue,
which was to preuent the

protesting, that it is not out of
contempt, but endeauoring all
they can, and euen putting the
Cupp to their mouth as closse

all scandal.</HI> They haue con|cluded
by this regulation,
that both kindes were not
essentiall to the Communion
by the institution of CHRIST;
for otherwise they would
haue bin bound, absolutely
to refuse the Sacrament to
such as were not able to re|ceaue
it compleat, and not
to giue it them in a manner
contrary to that CHRIST
JESVS had commanded; and
in that case their disability
would haue sufficiently ex|cused

haue conceaued that
such a rigour would be ex|cessiue,
<PB N="162" REF="92" MS="y">
if they did not
allow at least one of the Spe|cies

and since this condescenden|ce

confesse with vs, that the
words whereby CHRIST IE|SVS
hath proposed to vs the
two Species are liable to
some interpretation, and that
the right vnderstanding of
them ought to be declared
by the Authority of the
Church.</P>
<P>But it might seeme that
this Article of their Disci|pline,
which is of the Synode
of Poytiers held 1560, had
bin reformed by the Synode
of Vertueil assembled in the
year 1567, where it is said,
<PB N="163" REF="92">
<HI>that the company is not of opi|nion

Synodes neuerthelesse are

that of Vertueil spea|keth
of those, who <HI>Will not
receaue the Cupp,</HI> and that of
Poytiers of such, as <HI>Can not</HI>
take it. And indeed, not|withstanding
the Synode of
Vertueil, that Article remai|neth
in their Discipline, nay
more, hath bin approued by
a Synode later then that of
Vertueil, namely by the Sy|node
of Rochelle in 1571,
where the Article was re|newed,

state which it now remai|neth
in.</P>
<P>But supposing the Synodes
<PB N="164" REF="93">
of the Pretended-Reformers
had differr'd &amp; varied in their
opinions, that would serue
only to manifest, that the
matter in question is not a
point of Faith, but of that
kind which the Church may
order &amp; dispose of, accor|ding
to their own principles.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XVIII"> There remaineth now no|thing
but to expose what the
Catholiques hold touching
the Word of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The written &amp; vnwrit|ten Word.</NOTE> &amp; con|cerning
the Authority of the
Church.</P>
<P>CHRIST IESVS hauing lay'd
the foundation of his Church
vpon the Preaching of his
Disciples, the Vnwritten
Word was the first guide &amp;
rule of Christianity, &amp; when
the writings of the New Te|stament
were adioyned to
<PB N="165" REF="93">
them, the former Word did
not for all that loose its Au|thority,
which causeth vs to
accept with the same vene|ration
all that was taught by
the Apostles, be it by wri|ting,
or by word of mouth,
according to what S. Paul
himself hath expresly inioy|ned.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Thess. 2. 14.</NOTE>
And the certain proofe
that a Doctrine comes from
the Apostles, is, its being
accepted and embraced by
all Christian Churches whilst
its beginning can not be
pointed &amp; mark'd out. We
can not choose but receaue
all that is establish'd in this
manner with the submission
due to the Diuine Authority;
and we are confident that
such persons of the Preten|ded-Reformed
Religion, as
<PB N="166" REF="94">
are not very obstinate, haue
the same perswasion in the
bottome of their harts, it
being impossible to beleeue
that a Doctrine setled and
receaued from the be|ginning
of the Church, can
flow from any other spring
then that of the Apostles.
Wherefore our Adversaries
ought not to wonder, that
we, being zealously carefull
to inherit all that our Fathers
haue left vs, doe conserue
the Deposite of Tradition, as
well as that of the Scriptures.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XIX"> The Church being ordained
by God to be the Deposita|ry
of the Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Church's Authority.</NOTE> &amp; of Tra|dition,
we receaue from her

our Aduersaries say)
<PB N="167" REF="94" MS="y">
that it is principally the
Church's Authority that de|termineth
vs to reuerence as
Diuine writt, the song of Sa|lomon,
which hath so few
sensible markes of Propheti|call
inspiration; and likewise
the Epistle of S. Iames, which
Luther reiected; and that
of S. Iude, which might be
suspected, by reason of some
Apocriphall bookes cited in
it: in fine there can be no
motiue, but that Authority,
to perswade the receauing
the whole body of the holy
Scriptures, which Christians
accept as Diuine, euen before
the reading hath wrougt any
feeling of the Spirit of God
in those bookes.</P>
<P>Being then inseparably
bound, as we are, to the
<PB N="168" REF="95">
Authority of the Church, by
meanes of the Scriptures,
which we receaue from her
hand, we are taught al|so
by her Tradition, and by
the help of Tradition the true
sense of the Scriptures. So
that the Church professeth
to say nothing, meerly of
her self; and likewise that
she inventeth nothing new
in her Doctrine; that she
doth but follow and declare
the Diuine Reuelation by the
interiour direction of the ho|ly
spirit, which is giuen her
for her Teacher.</P>
<P>That the holy Ghost
expresseth himself by the
Church, the dispute raised
about the Ceremonies of the
Law, euen in the time of the
Apostles, doth euidence;
<PB N="169" REF="95">
and their Acts haue directed
all succeeding ages (by the
manner that first contest was
decided) by what Autho|rity
all following differences
are to be determined: so
that whensoeuer any dis|pute
happens to deuide the
faithfull, the Church will
interpose her Authority, and
the Pastours assembled will
say after the Apostles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 15. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="over-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">:</NOTE> <HI>It

the Church hath pronounced
and determined, her chil|dren
will be taught not to
examine a new the Articles
resolued vpon, but that they
are bound to accept with all
submission the Church's De|cisions.
And in this methode
we follow S. Paul and Silas,
<PB N="170" REF="96">
who deliuered to the faith|full
the first iudgment of
the Apostles; and were so
farr from allowing a new
discussion of what had bin

the Apostles.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 16. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>In this manner the chil|dren
of God acquiesce in
the iudgment of the Church,
beleeuing that by her mouth
they hear the Oracle of the
Holy Ghost, and it is vpon
the ground of this perswa|sion,
that after hauing pro|fess'd
in the Creed, <HI>I beleeue
in the Holy Ghost</HI> we ioine
next to it, <HI>The Holy Catho|lique
Church,</HI> by which pro|testation
we oblige our sel|ues
to acknowledge an In|fallible
<PB N="171" REF="96">
and Perpetuall Veri|ty
in the Catholique Church;
since the same Church,
which we beleeue perseue|ring
throughout all ages,
would cease to be a Church,
if it left to teach the Truth
reuealed by God: so that
such as apprehend least she
should abuse her power by
introducing Falsities, haue
little Faith in him, by whose
hand she is held and con|ducted.</P>
<P>And if our Aduersaries
would consider &amp; discusse
these matters in a fairer and
more humane manner, they
would be forced to auowe
that the Catholique Church
is so farre from affecting to
render herself Mistresse of her
Faith (as her Aduersaries
<PB N="172" REF="97">
charge her) that quite con|trary
she hath laboured with
all her power to binde her
self, and to exclude all
means of In~ouation, since she
doth not only submitt to the
holy Scriptures, but, to ba|nish
for euer all Arbitrary
interpretatio~s, (which would
make the conceipts of men
passe for Scripture) decla|reth
herself obliged to vn|derstand
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co~c. Trid. seff. 4.</NOTE> in what re|lateth
to Faith or Manners,
conformably to the sense of
the holy Fathers; from which
she professeth neuer to de|part,
declaring by all her
Councells, and by all her
Professions of Faith, already
published, that she admit|teth
no point of Doctrine,
which is not conformable
<PB N="173" REF="97">

ages.</P>
<P>Moreouer, if our Aduer|saries
will examine their Con|sciences,
they will discerne,
that the name of the Church
hath more authority ouer
their minds, then they dare
auowe in their disputes: and
I am perswaded there is not
any one prudent &amp; iudicious
man amongst them, who
finding himself alone in his
perswasion, (how euident
soeuer it might seeme to
him) that would not be
frightned with that Singula|rity;
so manifest it is, that
men haue need in these mat|ters
to be supported in their
opinions by the Authority
of some Society, that is of
the same iudgment. And for
<PB N="174" REF="98">
this reason God, who hath
created vs, and knoweth
what is most proper for vs,
hath ordained for our benefit,
that all particular subiects
should render obedience to
his Church, the Authority

the best establish|ed,
not only by the testi|mony
which God himself
renders in proofe of it in the
holy Scriptures, but likewise
by the euidencies of his Di|uine

thereof.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="XX"> This Soueraigne Authority<NOTE PLACE="marg">The opinion of those of the Preten|ded Refor|med Reli|gion concer|nig the Au|thority of the church.</NOTE>

after hauing discredi|ted
&amp; decryed it, as an in|supportable
Tyranny, haue
bin at last necessitated to au|thorise
&amp; establish it amongst
themselues.</P>
<P>When those, who are cal|l'd
Independants, maintained
openly, that euery indiui|duall
of the faithfull ought
to follow the light of his
conscience, without being
obliged to submitt his iudg|ment
to any body, or Eccle|siasticall
assembly, and that
vpon this ground they refu|sed
to subiect themselues to
Synodes; that of Charenton
held 1644. censured this
<PB N="176" REF="99">
Doctrine vpon the same rea|sons,
and in regard of the
same inconueniences, which
moued vs to reject it. That
Synode obserueth in the first
place, that the Error of the
Independants consisteth in
their holding, that, <HI>euery
single Church ought to gouerne
it self by her own lawes,
without dependance vpon any
person, in Ecclesiasticall af|fairs,
and without any obli|gation
to conforme to the Au|thority
of Conferences, and
Synodes, in point of their con|duct
&amp; regulation.</HI> And in
order thereunto the same
Synode determineth that <HI>this
Sect is as preiudiciall to the
State as to the Church; that it
setteth open a dore to all sorts
of irregularities and extraua|gancies;
<PB N="177" REF="99">
that it cutts off all
means of applying any reme|dy;
and if it tooke place, there
might be as many Religions
inuented, as there are parti|cular
parishes or assemblies.</HI>
These last words shew cleer|ly
that it was principally
in point of Faith that this
Synode intended to establish
<HI>a Dependance,</HI> since the great
est inconuenience, it obser|ues
the faithfull would be
lyable to, by this indepen|dency,
is, that <HI>there might
be as many Religions formed
and professed as there are pa|rishes.</HI>
It followeth then of ne|cessity,
by the Doctrine of
this Synode, that euery par|ticular
Church (and much
more euery priuate person)
ought to Depend (in what
<PB N="178" REF="100">
belongs to Faith) vpon a
Superiour Authority, which
resides in some Assembly, or
Body of men, to which Au|thority
all the Faithfull sub|iect
their priuate iudgments;
for the independants doe not
refuse to submit vnto the
Word of God, in that sense
they conceaue they ought to
vnderstand it, nor to accept
the Decision of Synodes,
when, after they haue exa|mined
them, they conclude
them reasonable, and fitt to
be obserued: what they re|fuse
to yeald vnto, is, to re|signe
vp their priuate iudg|ment
vnto that of an Assem|bly,
vpon this ground, which
our Aduersaries haue lai'd
for them, viz, that all Assem|blies
euen that of the Vni|uersall
<PB N="179" REF="100">
Church, is a compa|ny
of Men subiect to Error,
vnto which consequently a
Christian ought not to sub|iect
his iudgment, since he
oweth his resignation but to
God alone. It is from this
pretension of the Indepen|dants,
that all those incon|ueniences
are inferr'd, which
the Synode of Charenton
hath so well obserued: for
what profession soeuer be
made to submit vnto the
Word of God, if euery one
thinketh he hath right to vn|derstand
it according to his
own iudgment, though it be
contrary to the sense of the
Church declared in a Finall
decree, this pretension <HI>will
open the way to all sorts of
extrauagancies, and exclude
<PB N="180" REF="101">
all means of applying any re|medy,</HI>
since the Decision of
the Church is no restraint
to such, as doe not conceaue
themselues bound to submit
vnto it; and in fine it <HI>will
open the way to frame as ma|ny
Religions</HI> not only <HI>as there
are parishes,</HI> but euen as there
are priuate heads.</P>
<P>For precaution against these
inco~ueniencies, from whence
would ensue the ruyne of
Christian Religion, the Sy|node
of Charenton is forced
to constitute <HI>a Dependance
in Ecclesiasticall matters,</HI> and
euen in points of Faith. But
this their designed Deference
will neuer retrench those per|nicious

speake of it in these termes;
<HI>There it is that the Entier &amp;
Finall resolution shall be ta|ken,
according to the Word of
God; to which if they refuse
to acquiesce in euery point,
and with a direct renouncing
of their Errors, they shall be
cutt off from the Church.</HI> Is
it not then euident that the
Pretended-Reformers doe
not attribute the Authority
of this Finall iudgment to the
Word of God taken alone
by it self, and without de|pendance
on the Authority
<PB N="183" REF="102">
of the Church; since the
Word hauing bin employ'd
and consulted in the first con|clusions
they haue made vpo~

<P>But the forme of those
Letters of deputation which

<PB N="184" REF="103" MS="y">
when they were to send de|puties
to the Nationall Sy|node,
is yet more positiue:
it runns in these termes. <HI>We

and to obey &amp; exe|cute
it with all our power,

that God will preside in it,
and conduct you by his holy
Spirit into all truth and equity
by the rule of his Word.</HI> Here
the point is not the recea|u<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">ng
of the resolution of a
Synode after hauing discer|n'd,
that it hath ordain'd ac|cording
to the Scripture,
but here is a submission made
unto it euen before the as|sembling
of it; and this is
done by reason they are per|swaded
<PB N="185" REF="103">
<HI>that the holy spirit

be grounded vpon an

the holy Ghost affor|deth
the Church in her
Finall ordinances, the Catho|liques
themselues require

<P>Thus the proceedings of
our Aduersariers doe mani|fest,
that they concurr with
vs in the necessity of a Su|preme
Authority, without
which there can neuer be
<PB N="186" REF="104">
a Finall decision of any doubt
in Religion: and although,
when they cast of the yoke of
Obedience, they denied that
the faithfull were obliged to
resigne their iudgment vp to
that of the Church, yet the
necessity of settling some or|der
among themselues hath
forced them, in processe of
time, to acknowledg, what
their first engagement had
moued them to contradict.</P>
<P>Nay they haue gone much
farther in the National Sy|node

the year 1578. There was
some ouerture made of a re|concilement
with the Luthe|rans

This in fine is the re|sult
of that feigned tender|nesse

Submission we professe to the

they, but a company of men

they, being assembled them|selues
in a Body at a Natio|nall
Synode, which repre|sented
all the Pretended-Re|formed
Churches of France,
haue nor scrupuled to leaue
their Faith to the Arbitra|tion
of four persons, with so
Absolute a Resignation of
their Iudgments, that they
transferr'd vpon them a full
power to change the very
Confession it self, which they
propose, euen to this day, to
all Christian people as a Con|fession
of Faith, which con|taineth
nothing but the pure
Word of God; and for which

Kings) they haue said, that
<PB N="191" REF="106">
an infinite number of people
were ready to shed their
blood. I leaue the prudent
Reader to make his reflecti|ons
vpon the Decree of this
Synode, and will conclude
in few words my explication
of the perswasions &amp;, tenents
of the Catholique Church.</P>
<P>The sonne of God hauing
bin pleased that his Church
should remaine one, and be
solidly built vpon this Vnity,
hath instituted &amp; founded the <MILESTONE N="XXI">
Primacy of S^t Peter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Autho|rity of the holy see of Rome, and of Episcopacy&punc;</NOTE> to main|taine
and cement it: where|upo~we
acknowledgethe same
Primacy in the Successors of
the Prince of the Apostles, vn|to
whome vpon that title we
owe that Submission &amp; Obe|dience,
which the holy Coun|cells
&amp; Fathers haue taught,
and inioyn'd the faithfull.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="107">As for those points, which
are so vsually disputed in the
Schooles, although the Mi|nisters
doe co~tinually alledge
them, to asperse, and render
that Authority odious, it is
to little purpose to mention
them in this discourse, since
they are not points of Catho|lique
Faith. It is sufficient
here to confesse a Head esta|blished
by God: which will
freely be accorded by all such
as affect Vnion &amp; Concord
of Christian Fraternity, &amp; Ec|clesiasticall
Vnanimity.</P>
<P>And certaine it is, that if
the Founders of the Preten|ded
Reformation had loued
Vnity in the Church, they
would neuer haue abolished
Episcopall Gouernement,
which we finde established
<PB N="193" REF="107">
by IESVS-CHRIST him|self,
and which we see im|power'd
&amp; authorised euen
in the dayes of the Apostles;
nor would they haue despi|sed
the Authority of S. Pe|ter's
seate, which hath so so|lid
a foundation in the Ghos|pel,
and so euident a conti|nuation
in Ecclesiasticall Tra|dition:
they would rather
haue zealously maintain'd
Episcopall Iurisdiction, which
setleth &amp; preserueth Vnion
in particular Churches, and
the Primacy of S. Peter's
Chaire, which is the common
center of all Catholique Vnio~.</P>
<P>This is the exposition of
the Catholique Doctrine,<MILESTONE N="XXII">
wherein,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclusion of the Trea|tise.</NOTE> to tye my self to
what is most important in it,
I haue declined some ques|tions,
<PB N="194" REF="108">
which the Pretended-Reformers
themselues doe
not account a legitimate mo|tiue
for a Breach, or Separa|tion:
and I may hope that
those of their Communion,
who shall examine fairely
&amp; with Christian equity all
the parts and consequences
of this Treatise, will by the
reading thereof, be better
disposed to accept, and ac|quiescevnto
those proofs, vpo~
which the Faith of the Chur|ch
is established, and will at
least auowe that many of
our Controuersies may be
decided by a syncere expli|cation
of our perswasions, and
that our Doctrine is Holy;
and that, euen by their own
principles, none of the Ar|ticles
of our Beleef ouerthrow
the Foundations of our Eter|nall
<PB N="195" REF="108">
Beatitude.</P>
<P>If any one shall conceaue
it requisite to reply to this
Treatise, I must desire him
to consider, that to aduance
any thing towards his intent,
he must not attempt to re|fute
the Doctrine it contai|neth,
since my designe was
to Propose it only, without
Supporting it by any Proofs;
and if in some passages I haue
touched part of the grounds,
&amp; reasons which establish it,
the reason was because the
knowledg of the principall
grounds of a Doctrine, doth
often beare a part necessary
for its explication.</P>
<P>It would be also a great
digression from the designe
of this Treatise to dicusse the
different ways, methodes,
motiues, and arguments whi|ch
<PB N="196" REF="109">
the Catholique Diuines
make use of to establish, or
illustrate the Doctrine of the
Councel of Trent; and the
various consequences parti|cular
Doctors haue deduced
from them. To vrge any
thing solide against this Trea|tise,
and that cometh home
to the point, it must either be
proued by some acts, which
the Church hath engaged
herselfe to receaue, that her
Faith is not here faithfully
deliuered; or be shewed, that
this explanation leaueth all
the Aduersaries Obiections
in their full force; or in fine
it must be exposed directly
wherein this Doctrine sub|uerteth
the Grounds and
Foundation of Faith.</P>
