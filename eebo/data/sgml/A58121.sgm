<P>Sir&mdash; with your mouth wide open as if you were coming to eat me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have more stomach to sleep than to eat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sluggish Brute cannot you watch one night without all this yawning and rubbing your eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>These signs are the Language of Nature, by which she declares her wants. Draw but the Teat from the mouth of a Babe, and still the lips retain a pretty sucking motion, which tels us with a silent sort of Oratory, that it is still a hungry. Nature even in the most vile sort of Animals will not without
<PB N="2" REF="4">
complaints be denyed her due refections. I think Sir, it is as natural to sleep as to eat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes to such Sots as you it is natural to do nothing else but sleep and eat. You slept enough, if snoring be a sign of sleeping.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little towards morning, when I had no more paper left to burn under my Nose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your loud snoring had not waken'd me your sitting up all night, had been to much purpose, instead of your cal|ling me, I was fain to call you, half a dozen kicks could scarcely rouze you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you did ill to treat a servant so, that does your business as well sleeping as waking. I knew my faculty, and therefore had no scruple of Conscience to take a nap contrary to your commands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have helpt you to an excuse for your negligence, but you had best not let me catch you napping so any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>The next time you have an occasion to rise early, let me but lie in your Antichamber upon a pallad Bed, and you will find you have a Servant more advantageous for the design of waking you, than a Cock, or an Alarum-Clock.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's not a man in all <HI>Toledo</HI> sleeps with the like de|corum. I have a clear Conscience, and my sleeps are harmoni|ous.</P>

<P>Go, leave rubbing your eies and look about, if you see e'r a Lady entring the Church give me notice.</P>

<P>Well if he takes up the trade of being a Lover, I'le lay down that of Vallet; for Lovers are alwayes thus cholle|rick, and I shall have but a Spaniels life on't, lie down at his Chamber door a nights, and in the morning rise and shake my ears, and all the day after be set a rangeing, or be bid to

<SPEAKER>Elvi.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Don Gusman,</HI> for so I know you are called, tho you are ignorant both of my name and Quality, tell me with what sentiments do you receive a visit from a Lady, that thus ex|poses her honour to your censure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all the faith, sence, and honour, that a true Ca|vileer ought, who is thought worthy to be trusted, and so high|ly honour'd by a Lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elvi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not the Letter I sent you yesterday with a summons to meet an unknown person much surprise you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was surpris'd to think, that you would trust your person with me here, that in your Letter durst not trust me with your name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elvi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think you know me, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure I do not, for if I did, you would then know me, of which I find the contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure I do not, for if I did, you would then know me, of which I find the contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elvi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I call'd you by your name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, did you know me, you would in your Letter have intrusted me with your name, and here with a sight of your person. Whilst you keep your Vail on, I am sure you don't know me as you ought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elvi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess Sir, what I have done proceeds not from my knowledge, but from my belief of your gallantry, and you may hope much when my faith is confirm'd by experience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope Love will inspire you with a quick faith, to be|lieve that if you should discover to me all those glorious charms
<PB N="4" REF="5">
you are enrich'd with, that I should be capable of conserving a sufficient Empire o're my self, and to remember what I am obliged to render to so great a merit as yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elvi.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I find you as discreet, as I think you gallant, I shall have a very great inclination to acknowledge the trouble I have given you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am resolved, how great so e're my passion is, my re|spect shall be inseparable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elvi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though you wonder, yet blame not my denial. A proceedure so new as this, seems to have something in it inex|cusable, but when you shall learn, what at present I must not acquaint you with, you will then at least not condemn it: all that I can now say to you is, That the liberty I take ought not to make you think any thing to my disadvantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not press you to enlarge your favours; but that I know the discovery of your person will give me yet more advantageous thoughts of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elvi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of some Quality, and without vanity I will say, I have attractions enough to engage you to more than you think, if it were permitted me to shew you them. But I have reasons not to be subverted, that now make me conceal my self from your sight. Desist from further expectations till time has convinced me, that I may with assurance trust you with the sight and knowledge of my person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you have the cruelty to raise me to this high ex|pectation, and leave me here to be tortured by imagination?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elvi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will unvail my self if you have the injustice to de|mand it, but then I will for ever withdraw from your sight; this day past you shall never see me more.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Elvira <HI>puls off her glove to turn up her Vail.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, yet now I see your hand uncovered, it appears so fine, I am more desirous and impatient to behold the rest. By that little patern I perceive the whole piece is excellent, Madam I must acknowledge I should be transported to see you, if you had that indulgent goodness to suffer it. But since you have reasons to the contrary, I ought to have some too not to desire it, but rather accommode my self to what is your plea|sure
<PB N="5" REF="5">
to prescribe, than let you grant, what I had the insolence to press you to.</P>

<SPEAKER>Iac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, <HI>Don Ruis</HI> is at the further end of the Street, and comes towards the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elvi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I must leave you at present, but by your respect to me, and the honour of a Cavileer, I charge you not to fol|low me one step, nor cause me to be followed by any, for besides that your curiosity would be vain, I would never more converse with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>What assurance do you give me that you ever will a|gain, or how distant is that happy minute from this hour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elvi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will half an hour hence meet you in this very place, and tell you when and where you shall see me next.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>In this half hour consider you have drawn me to the rack, and leave me there upon the full streach, and resolve to have the charity to ease my pain, by the shortness of your delay, Think, one that has had a glimpse of Heaven how wrapt he is with desires to have a full view of its glories.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much as you abound in virtuous sentiments, and so punctual as <HI>I</HI> find you to my commands <HI>I</HI> will endeavour to have thoughts of you, that shall not displease you, Adieu.</P>

<P>So 'tis even as <HI>I</HI> thought, one assignation begets ano|ther, this night will be a Vigil too: and so it will go on night after night, till at last <HI>I</HI> run mad for want of sleep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sanc.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> was thinking, that Lovers are very vertuous peo|ple, for they in one months intrigue keep more Vigils, than are found in the Churches Kalender for a whole year.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ruis.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Don Gusman</HI> good morrow to you, you are got early to your Devotions&mdash; I was no sooner up, but I came into your apartment, and knock'd at your chamber door, and my Ser|vants told me you went out at break of day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had some thoughts in my mind that broke my repose, and therefore got up early, that I might be so sleepy at night, that no disquiet of mind, may then hinder me from taking my rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ruis.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Don Gusman</HI> put not on these disguises before your Friend, if it be inconvenient for me to know your secrets, I will not press you to a discovery, but your early rising this morning I know was design; for hearing a noise last night, I rose, and looking into your Anti-chamber, I saw <HI>Sanco</HI> sit nodding with his head in the Chimney, and hold smoking pa|per under his nose to keep him awake: I doubt not but in or|der to obey your commands of calling you early this morning. I then ghess'd at the design, and retir'd to my bed without taking further notice, and your early going abroad this morn|ing, has confirm'd the truth of my suspitions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must own you were not mistaken, yet in justification of what I told you, I will acquaint you with the cause whence those thoughts did proceed, which broke the soundness of my sleep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ruis.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you doubt my friendship, or think I want the fa|culty to conceal, what you are about to entrust to my know|ledge, yet forbear the discovery: I assure you I am not at all curious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor do I wrong your friendship with such suspitions. I must draw him from this ground, and the relati.
<STAGE>aside.</STAGE>
on of what is already pass'd affords me a pretence. If you'll defer your devotions we will take a turn in the Cloy|sters, and I will there give you a short relation of no unplea|sant adventure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ruis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you do not repent your early rising.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>As yet I have no cause.&mdash; <HI>Sanco</HI> be vigilant, and if you discover the vail'd Lady or her attendant coming, step to the Cloyster door and becken me, I'le have my eie still this

way.&mdash; Be sure you let 'em not depart till I have first spoken with 'em.</P>

<P>I look on <HI>Don Gusman</HI> to be more discreet than to trust affairs of this nature to the knowledge of any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elvi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe he would not, if he could reveal to him a Ladies name, but if relating only the business, my Brothers cu|riosity should lead him to be an eye witness of our second in|terview, and place himself, where, unseen, he may behold what manner of person <HI>I</HI> am, he may ghess by my motion, or actions, or stature: <HI>I</HI> will not expose my self to the danger of being known.</P>

<P>At his prayers Rascal, do you say your prayers like English Phanaticks through the Nose? must the Church be your dormitary, and my cloak your covering? if <HI>I</HI> find it any more about your villanous shoulders, I'le pin it to your back with a <HI>Toledo</HI> bodkin.</P>

<P>Her mein and behaviour shew'd her of breeding, her shape was Charming, her wit was great, and no question but what she conceales, is not less beautiful and surprising; slave, if you had had any wit, or minded your Masters interest, you might have discourst the woman whilst I was talking to the Mistress, and have given her occasion to let fall some word, that might a little have contributed to the discovery of what I now remain ignorant.</P>

<P>A wise man never makes a puther&punc; when reason tells him tis unnecessary and surperfluous, no doubt but the Lady you commend, has as many good thoughts of you; thinks you are as handsome and comely a person as walks the streets of <HI>Toledo,</HI> And judges no less by your embroder'd suits and change of rich apparel (which you shift oftener than the Major Domo of his Majesty) that you are too of Quality, but with more reason; and from thence too imagins, that you treat nobly all the Amorettos that you keep; and intends, I warrant you, that you shall be the cheif of her Dons.</P>

<P>I acknowledge I am not worth your trouble of cha|stiseing, and it is to profane your noble hand to let it fal on any part of me but you'd let me have the priviledge of speaking two or three words; I wou'd demand, in what particular you find this person so virtuous; what virtue is there in appointing a Love embassadress, to stand century, who imagining that she has found her Cully, gives an assignation by break of day the the next morning; when all the virtuous people that I know are at that time, as I us'd to be, fast a sleep.</P>

<P>What's your business?</P>

<P>Is not your Mistress an unreasonable woman to make a young Gentleman to rise at break of day to meet her, and then to pop him off with so short a visit; to leave him with|out shewing him her face: to say she'd come again within half an hour, and to break her promise and ne'r go near him since?

<P>I would fain know what your Mistress's meaning was, to set you last night at the corner of a Street, angling for my Master with the enticing bait of an amorous assignation, and when you might have got him by the gills, forsook the sport?

<P>I find you very full of temerity in presuming to say you abandon me. You, whom I have so often ordain'd never to see me more, but have no sooner banisht you my presence, but <HI>I</HI> have seen you at my feet, imploring my grace, and making use of all your entreaties, to incline me to repeal the sentence, and declar'd that you could not without death obey: if my chains, as you scornfully say, are so easie to be broken, why have you not done it twenty times before? either they are more power|full than your malice will allow, or you are a very weak man, <HI>Don Diego.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dieg.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have sometimes driven me from you, but 'twas when you were sure that I would return again; of which you were glad, as appears by your frequent revoking those com|mands.</P>

<P>You are not the first troublesome companion, that has been received out of respect to good manners, and whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ne sees with regret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dieg.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I will no more, Madam, be that troublesome per|son. I will have the honour now to quit you, and do let you
<PB N="19" REF="12">
know, before I take my leave of you, that it is to be for ever; and that your lingring in the Church longer as you have for|merly done, expecting that I should come and make my ad|dresses to you, will now signifie nothing, and if I go or come by your house, or stand still near it, it shall not be out of de|sign that you should send <HI>Beatrice</HI> to invite me in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I would have you know, that <HI>I</HI> will never go to Church hereafter, but with my Father, in whose presence you dare not, unless <HI>I</HI> please, say the least thing to me; and that you shall, if you have a fancy for it, walk in sight of my window, a thousand times in a day; and <HI>I</HI> not take the least notice of you. If I look out and smile, interpret it not kind|ness, but in derision of your folly. And since you are so kind to promise me never to come here again, I will be so civil to dismiss you now without further ceremony, and deal really with you, and let you know, <HI>I</HI> wish with all my heart that you were already gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dieg.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do assure it me with an indifference too great to make me in the least doubt of what you say; in what I spake, there was something I know not what of passionate, which sufficiently discovers, if you had a mind to observe it, that I love you still, though you deserve it not: But the cruel indif|ference that you have now shewn, makes it plainly appear, you never had any true love for me; and so Madam I'le be preparing to take my leave. <HI>Beatrice,</HI> prithee give me a glass of your fair water.

<P>If we stand here we can't lose sight of 'em: here we may see all up that Street.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sudden resolution of my Brother was very lucky to our present design; I should else have been puzled to have invented a pretence to go abroad just at this time of the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iac.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was his reason at first to conceal you from <HI>Don Guzman</HI>? and e're since he came to be his Ghest, to confine you to the back apartment of his house, and tell him you are out of town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>For fear any thing should be discours'd to my prejudice, if it was known that <HI>Don Gusman</HI> had a lodging so near me. Have you still sight of 'em <HI>Iacinta</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iao.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Madam, the House must be hereabouts that they look for, by their hankering so. But Madam, the same reason continuing still, why does <HI>Don Ruis</HI> now order you to go to your Aunts, and to come home to his House in her Coach an hour hence; as if you were just come out of the Coun|trey?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I objected the same, when I received his orders. And he told me that was but a pretended reason. And that the true ground of my concealment was, that he had information there would be some Overtures of a marriage with me, made to him by <HI>Don Francisco de Medina</HI>; of whose Revenue my Brother is a greater admirer than ever <HI>I</HI> shoud have been of his Person. And that some dayes since he heard his Applications are elsewhere, and his affections deeply en|gag'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Iac.</SPEAKER>
<P>That no doubt is the true reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>And since the, friendship betwixt my Brother and <HI>Don Gusman</HI> is much increas'd. My Brother has acquainted him with the love of <HI>Octavia</HI>: that <HI>Don Diego</HI> is his Rival, and that his pretentions are rewarded with the favours which his fidelity more justly merits. <HI>Don Gusman</HI> on the other side has
<PB N="22" REF="14">
given him a relation of our assignation, and what pass'd this morning; of <HI>Sanco</HI>'s success in pursuit of the vail'd Lady; and of his present coming abroad with design to walk under the window. All this my Brother told me, to let me see the difference, betwixt my manner of living, and that of many other Ladies, who hazard the honour of their Families, by the indiscreet liberty they take, and applauds the Life <HI>I</HI> lead, ascri|bing all to his care, and conduct of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I wonder who this blundring <HI>Sanco</HI> has by mistake fol|lowed instead of us.</P>

<P>Ay, here they are. They spy'd you from their win|dows, and are come down to you. So there's the inviting dop for you.

<P>When a Woman likes her man, she has an Eye like a Hawk: She'l spy him twelve score off. And if she don't care for him, she's so blind, she can't see him, though his mustachoes brush her Nose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, thus unexpectedly to surprise me with your presence, was the only way you had to make amends for your breach of promise to me this morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I came not now to make excuses for my self, but to complain of you. If <HI>I</HI> have broke my word it is by your example, and my not coming to you was your own fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>How Madam, is it possible? That I, who waited with a burning desire of seeing you again, should be the occasion of your not coming, which is the thing I now lament of. <HI>I</HI> am confounded to think how you should be worse than
<PB N="23" REF="14">
your word by the example of one, who so exactly kept his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> have evidence enough to justifie my complaint.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be not a disparagement to seek a witness in a Ser|vant, <HI>Sanco</HI> can testifie how diligent I was not to miss your re|turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>San.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my Master set a Memorandum on my nose and ears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I stir'd not from the place, but out of design to re|move a Freind, whose presence, <HI>I</HI> fear'd, might interrupt your coming. But my Servant I planted there all the while to give me notice of your first approach. But if your find|ing him a sleep, as I did, has been the occasion; I revoke my act of mercy, and declare his fault unpardonable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>To render my self more intelligible, know that it is not of his neglect of duty, or your want of diligence that I com|plain, but of your indiscretion; the greatest fault a Cavalier can be guilty of, is to publish the favours he receives from per|sons of our Sex. I perceive by the colour that now rises in your face, that you already understand my meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Eyes, whose transcendant brightness easily pene|trates the thickness of that vail which covers them, are wit|nesses too illustrious not to be believ'd. I confess I made a Friend my Confident, a Friend that till now I ever found dis|creet. but by what you inform me, I discover how much a Captive he is to you, and that the Empire you have over him has made his love do violence to his friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>You take me then to be the Mistress of your Freind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Madam, I take you to be <HI>Octavia de Pimentel,</HI> whom <HI>Don Ruis</HI> adores. And now I begin to lose the hopes I had conceiv'd. For how adorable soever you be, love ought not to make me undertake any thing to the prejudice of my Friend. Rather than add to the number of his Rivals by of|fering you my heart, I ought to lend him the assistance of my Sword to remove them he already has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do know <HI>Octavia,</HI> but I am not her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are not her, I ought then to have a quarrel with <HI>Don Ruis</HI>; who by divulging the secret, is guilty of a crime,
<PB N="24" REF="15">
which nothing, but the interest of a Mistress could have ren|der'd excusable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Don Ruis</HI> is the best Friend you have. He told this to a person who hath given him as many proofs of fidelity, as you e'r receiv'd from him, and intended you no more harm in communicating it to that party, than you did me, when you related it to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he has discours'd it to one only, and that person be yourself, I cannot but be of opinion that you are his Mistress, if you are not her, do me the grace for one moment, to grant me the sight of those many charms your cruel vail robs me of. I shall then know if my friendship be inconsistent with the love my heart is going to be possest with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know <HI>Octavia</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Don Ruis</HI> often has shew'd me her picture, which out of devotion to her, he constantly wears about him: do not re|fuse me the happiness of being in a capacity to adore you with|out inquietude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>You desire a thing, that is not fit for me to grant, till I have had a sufficient proof of your discretion. It may be if I had told you my name before, or shew'd you my face, you had then too reveal'd one, and describ'd the other. No, my repu|tation is a thing that well deserves the best of my care with whom I entrust it. I'le see you again, as soon as I may safely tell you whom I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave me not without some further assurances that <HI>I</HI> shall again be thus blest, and that e're long I shall see you in the full lustre of your charms.</P>

<P>O <HI>Iacinta</HI> he knows my heart already. This answer is pen'd word for word to my desires. I fear'd the declaration of his love had been but expressions of gallantry, but this re|fusal to meet his veild unknown, gives me at once a proof both of his love and constancy.</P>

<P>The mistery of the Cerenade and Letter is not so hard to unridle, as you woud make me believe by an absolute deny|al of all: if you had said you knew of the Cerenade, but coud not help it, that you receiv'd his Love Letters but re|turn'd no answer, that he made himself my Rival but had no encouragement, you had seem'd to disapprove what you had done by being willing to excuse it; but not to acknowledge any thing is to confess your self criminal in all, and this assurance which you discover in your obstinate disowning my accusati|ons, shews the pleasure you have taken to offend me.

<P>It was an affront to both, therefore the best way to re|venge it, is for one to set upon him before, whilest the other at|taques him hehind.</P>

<P>In my judgement you are both too nice to interpret an affront from a gentlemans ill treatment of a Servant, when the Master is not in presence. A Servants sawciness oftentimes de|serves it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dieg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish, with a blind obedience, I could acknowledge the honour you do me in the care you take of my safety. But far from avoiding my enemies, honour obliges me to prevent their inquiry by my presence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, had you a single enemy, but you have two?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dieg.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Madam, for me you have this fear, I advise you to quit it. For the danger is not so great as you imagine, tho the odds be so. My enemies being valiant, they will without doubt be as generous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your honour obliges you to accept the combat, the interest of your Mistress forbids it. Do you think she can ap|prove of divulging so nice a secret, and if you love her as she deserves, wou'd it not be better to make a sacrifice of your fame to her, than to have the displeasure of exposing hers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dieg.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> should be much troubled, if it should cost me my own reputation to be sparing of anothers, whose interest I am no longer oblidg'd to. But if in obeying you, I shou'd be as|sur'd to do you a service; so pleasant a consideration, might make me forget what <HI>I</HI> owe my self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since neither the care of your self, nor the considerati|on of a person for whom you are oblig'd to have the greatest esteem in the world will induce you to comply. Know too, you will render me the greatest service imaginable. For as a se|cret I tell it you, that one of your two enemies is my Lover, the event of this quarrel must either way be unfortunate. If you conquer, death deprives me of him, if he vanquish you, <HI>I</HI> lose him in his flight.</P>

<P>Your Love shall ever be a secret, but as to the rest, it

I wou'd have told you likewise the name of your Rival, whose gallantry last night clash'd with yours, and to have left you no scruple, I'de have told you too, who has been false to us both; how all this came about, and last of all, how I came to the dis|covery.

<P>Answer me, Sir, I pray, to find a Lady in your Chamber, to force by a Sentinel, set to forbid entrance, to see you all con|fus'd at the surprise I gave you by pressing in; to hear your new Mistress talk of a divorce betwixt you and me, which was a secret, she cou'd not know, but from you alone; and lastly, to see you rather play the ridiculous person, then let slip any occasion to offend me, and to conduct a stranger down Stairs in the presence of one you knew, whom you left with|out the least civility of excuse.- answer me you that are so skil|ful in visions, if this be one, shall I be made believe that you know not this person, never saw her face, shall this pass for truth, or shall it all be vision, vision.</P>

<P>I have told you as much of <HI>Don Gusman,</HI> that I ne|ver had seen him, spoken to him, or receiv'd Letters from him, and yet you wou'd not believe me, tho you never found him in my Chamber. But <HI>Don Diego,</HI> after such evidences as I have receiv'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> befits not a man of good sense so grosly to impose on a person that hath either eyes or ears. And you'd have done better to have said, that you cou'd not hinder a Lady so accom|plish'd and beautiful, to have an inclination for you, that 'twou'd not have been like a gallant soul, to deny her entrance into your

house, when she came on purpose, to honour you with her visits. But that you receive them out of complaisance; that in your passion some words slipt from you of our falling out. But not to be willing to own any thing is to acknowledg your self guil|ty of all, and your obstinate denyal of your crime is a proof that you are not sorry for't.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>WOnder not, Madam, that the relation of this Quarrel gives me no more disquiet. <HI>Don Diego</HI> is a man so indifferent to me now, that I have no more than a common concern for his safety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you then be content to see the life of a Lover re|main expos'd to the fury of his enemies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> cou'd not once have suffer'd it. But know <HI>Elvira,</HI> that perfidious man has had the arrogance to scan even the most in|nocent actions of my life to find pretensions to justifie his own disloyalty. This day, not two hours since, I surpriz'd him in his Chamber with a shameless woman, whom he preferr'd to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Time is now too precious to be trifl'd away in unpro|fitable grievances. Know, dear Friend, I was that woman you surpris'd. I went to acquaint him with the intentions of his enemies, and to perswade him to that, which I now press you to undertake, your interruption and his own obstinate gallan|try rendred my indeavours ineffectual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have then my suspitions wrong'd him! And is he faith|ful still! Oh my friend, how subject are Lovers to mistakes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>His innocence thus clear'd consent to use your interest to perswade him to grant that to a Mistress he refus'd to one un|known.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'le rather let the worst happen fate has in store, than submit to visit him first. Try your interest, Madam, with <HI>Don Gusman.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> confess, Madam, I have some ascendancy over him, and if I desire him to sacrifice his resentment to me, I believe he will not refuse it. But know my Brother and he are gone to Court, and tho I have sent <HI>Iacinta</HI> home with orders to watch their
<PB N="60" REF="33">
return, and privately to acquaint <HI>Don Gusman,</HI> that I am at a Friends house, where <HI>I</HI> desire to speak with him, and to conduct him hither, yet I am afraid least they should attempt to find your Lover before they return home, to prevent that danger, you must condiscend to go immediately to <HI>Don Diego</HI> &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>To go and visit him after the solemn leave I have taken, O, <HI>I</HI> cannot think on't.</P>

<SPEAKER>Iac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, <HI>I</HI> have brought <HI>Don Gusman</HI> to the back door, where he waits for entrance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Madam, our design may be effected without the visit you are so unwilling to make.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Heavens! his coming hither is of dangerous conse|quence. He is the man of whom <HI>Don Diego</HI> is become jealous, and if he should know, that <HI>I</HI> have seen him here, he wou'd have reason to believe, that <HI>I</HI> have indeed betraid him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>To take away your fear, you shall understand how <HI>I</HI> contriv'd it. <HI>I</HI> order'd <HI>Iacinta</HI> to conduct him to the back door of your house, without giving him any account to whom it belong'd, tho he should make inquiry. Now let some one go down, and open the back door, and bring him up the private stair case, into your apartment, <HI>I</HI> alone will appear to receive him; thus it will be so far from coming to the knowledge of <HI>Don Diego,</HI> that <HI>Don Gusman</HI> himself will never know that he has been here in your House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if my Father should come whilst you are speaking with <HI>Don Gusman,</HI> I'le assure you; and suspect me to be half at least concern'd in some amorous intrigue. <HI>I</HI> assure you, he is a man the hardest of any in the world to be put off with excuses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let but the back door he enters at still remain unlock'd, and if it should so happen, that your Father returns, he may slip down the back stairs, and go out unseen.</P>

<P>I will not inquire the cause, Madam, of your concern, but certainly he must be either a Lover or a B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">other, and either of those Titles are sufficient to justifie your exacting from me an account of what is pass'd.</P>

<P>Quickly Sir let us hear &mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Don Diego,</HI> and my self, being gotten into the field, we had already our swords in our hands, and just ready to engage, when <HI>Don Ruis,</HI> who persu'd us with all speed, interpos'd and declar'd to <HI>Don Diego</HI> that I was not his enemy, but that he was the only man offended, and was able without my assistance to take his revenge. <HI>Don Diego</HI> might perhaps have hearken'd to what he said; but I urg'd that he cou'd not quit me for another, without confessing himself conquer'd. He cou'd not digest so harsh a word, yet the obstinate <HI>Don Ruis</HI> to prevent our en|gagement, put himself again betwixt us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>What will be event of this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whilst we were thus contending, some friends, who had likewise heard of our design, I know not how, came to us, and woud know the ground of our quarrel.</P>

<SPEAKER>Oct.</SPEAKER>
<P>This happy circumstance lightens my heart of half it's fears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Don Diego,</HI> forc'd by their importunity to tell the cause of his resentment, declar'd he was jealous of me, charging me of attempts to deprive him of the affections of a Lady, for whom he had an ardour that was inextinguishable, then mention'd a Serenade last night, and a Letter that this morning he surpriz'd
<PB N="62" REF="34">
in the hands of my servant. But <HI>Don Ruis</HI> clear'd me of these accusations owning himself the person that gave this Cerenade, and that sent the Letter too, but not to the Lady, but her ser|vant. <HI>Don Diego</HI> perceiving his errors, embrac'd me in the most obliging manner, and made excuses, which I receiv'd with a sin|cere affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Octavia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now my hopes blossom a pace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now to adjust matters betwixt him and <HI>Don Ruis,</HI> their friends affirmed, that the extroardinary beauty of a Lady might justifie both their pretensions to adore her. That two such Gallant persons, coveting the same object, declar'd it to be of a more then common value. And that a Lover without Rivals might conclude he had a Mistress without merit.</P>

<P>Stay Sir, and let me tell you in short, That I was no sooner return'd from the field, but I was inform'd by the Servant of <HI>Elvira,</HI> that her Mistress was gone to a Friends House, and had given her order to bring me to her with all speed, where she had an opportunity to discourse with me, which the presence of <HI>Don Ruis</HI> allow'd her not at home. I went: was conducted in a back way at a private door: was had up into a fair apartment, where I was received only by the fair <HI>Elvira,</HI> her first words demanded if I were resolv'd to fight with you. I replied we had already been in the field, and that you was no longer my enemy or her Brothers. Those doubtful words deceiv'd the understanding of one that hearken'd, for then a Lady bolted out of an inner Room, eagerly demanding if you was kill'd! Her passionate en|quiries forc'd from me a speedy relation of what had pass'd in the field, which scarce was ended when news was brought that her Father was come in; that he had lock'd the back door, which was left open for my retreat; to avoid his presence, I retired in|to an inner Room, but he no sooner enter'd, but <HI>Elvira</HI> took her leave to be gone, he offer'd her his service home, which she ac|cepted to give me an opportunity to get out of the house. They were no sooner gone, but your coming up occasioned a second surprise. I again made my retreat to the same place. What fol|low'd I need not tell you. Now <HI>Don Diego</HI> do you think, you and <HI>I</HI> have any occasion to go into the Field.</P>

<P>Ah <HI>Don Gusman,</HI> you interress your self too much to my disadvantage; I know this to be <HI>Octavia,</HI> I had a relation of what pass'd in her fathers house, with an account of her escape and being here, from <HI>Beatrice</HI> her own servant, whom I met as she was going to the Ladies Aunt.</P>

<P>If what you say be true, and that the person <HI>I</HI> see is not <HI>Octavia,</HI> let her tell me so her self, and <HI>I</HI>'le withdraw; <HI>I</HI> do not demand the sight of her, since she is unwilling to be seen, but one word is quickly spoke, and <HI>I</HI> am resolv'd not to retire til from her own mouth. <HI>I</HI> receive my adieu.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Two or three words Madam, will deliver us from his presence. <HI>I</HI> do not say in what a fear <HI>I</HI> am for you, and for my self, if it should happen that others should surprise you here: do not stay for the misfortunes which <HI>I</HI> foresee, since with one word you may have free passage

<SPEAKER>Gus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are much to blame <HI>Don Diego,</HI> for making any com|plaints against me; far from embracing the interest of <HI>Don Ruis</HI> I have protested to him, e're since he came, that this Lady was not <HI>Octavia,</HI> as he believ'd: but since you are both present, I am not any longer oblig'd to deny that it is she her self. If you are minded to have her away, behold I deliver her into your hand, for I know from her own mouth, that it was you she re|solv'd to make her choice.</P>

<P>He must take my life that will take her from hence, before she has told me her self, that it is you whose service she is pleas'd to accept. <HI>Don Gusman</HI> whom I thought my friend, does not give me marks enough of it, to oblige me to relie upon his word.
