<HEAD>To the well deseruing Cap|taine EDWARD PANTON, the Captaines and truly generous Gentlemen, Citizens of London, of the Societie of ARMES, practising in the Artillerie Garden.</HEAD>
<P>_WEe are all <HI>Souldiers,</HI> as wee are Christians: some more specially, as they are men. You beare both <HI>Spirituall</HI> Armes against the e|nemies of your Saluation, and <HI>Materiall</HI> Armes against the e|nemies of your Countrey. In both you fight vnder the Colours of our great Generall <HI>Iesus</HI> Christ. By loo|king a little into this mysticall warre, you shall the better vnderstand how to be <HI>Milites cataphracti,</HI> good <HI>Souldiers</HI> in all respects.</P>
<P><HI>Iob</HI> calls mans life a <HI>Warfare:</HI> and wee find, Reuel. 12. that <HI>there was warre in heauen: Mi|chael and his Angels fought against the Dra|gon; and the Dragon &amp; his Angels.</HI> Where by <HI>Heauen</HI> is meant the Church of God vpon earth; as
<PB REF="3">
Interpreters obserue generally. For in Heauen aboue there is no warfare, but welfare: no trouble, but <HI>Peace that passeth all vnderstanding</HI>: Now to this <HI>War</HI> euery <HI>Christian</HI> is a professed <HI>Souldier:</HI> not onely for a spurt, for sport; as young Gentlemen vse for a time to see the fashion of the warres: but our Vow runnes thus in <HI>Baptisme</HI>; that euery man vndertakes to <HI>fight manfully vnder Christs Ban|ner against Sinne, the World, and the Deuill; and to continue his faithfull Souldier and Ser|uant to his liues end.</HI> And this <HI>Battell</HI> let vs fight with courage, because we are warriours vnder that Generall that (without question) shall conquer. <HI>Nil desperandu~ Christo Duce, &amp; Auspice Christo. They ouercome by the blood of the Lambe.</HI> Reu 12.11. Though they loose some bloud, they shall be sure to winne the victorie.</P>
<P><HI>Bernard</HI> supposeth a great war between <HI>Christ</HI> the king of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> &amp; <HI>Satan</HI> the K. of <HI>Babylon.</HI> The <HI>Watchman</HI> on the wals spies a <HI>Christian</HI> soul|dier to be surprised by the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Host, &amp; car|ried captiue to their Tents. Hereof he informes the king, who presently chargeth <HI>Timorem,</HI> the <HI>Feare</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> to run &amp; redeeme the souldier. <HI>Feare</HI> comes thundring vpon the aduersary power, &amp; forceth the~ trembling to surrender backe their prey; which he
<PB REF="3">
is now returning home to the king. Hereupon steps vp <HI>Spiritus Tristitiae, Sadnes;</HI> &amp; cryes, O ye <HI>Ba|bylonians,</HI> is it not a shame that one man should re|scue a prisoner from such a multitude? Well <HI>ne ti|meatis a Timore isto,</HI> be not afraid of this fellow <HI>Feare:</HI> I will giue you a stratagem how to reduce him. This must not be done <HI>Marte sed arte;</HI> not by force but by fraud: marke the euent.</P>
<P>This Spirit of <HI>Sadnesse</HI> lyes in the way, and falls in with the <HI>Souldiers,</HI> colloguing as a friend, as a fiend; <HI>amica sed iniqua collocutione.</HI> Suspectles <HI>Feare</HI> followes a little off. But <HI>Sorrow</HI> had brought the Souldier to the brinke of a deepe Pitte, <HI>Despe|ration</HI>; and was euen vpon the point of thrusting him in; The <HI>Watchman</HI> obserues it, and againe tells the king: who (quicker then thought) dispatcheth a fresh supply of succour, <HI>Hope,</HI> to his deliuery. <HI>Hope</HI> mounted vpon a swift horse, <HI>Desire</HI>; comes amaine: and with the <HI>Sword</HI> of <HI>Gladnes</HI> puts <HI>Sorrow</HI> to flight; so quits him from the gulfe of Despaire. Once again is the <HI>Citizen</HI> of heaue~ freed: now <HI>Hope</HI> sets him (being weary) on his own horse, <HI>Desire</HI>: himselfe leads him with the Cord of <HI>Promised mercy: Feare</HI> comes after with a switch made of <HI>Remembrance of sinnes,</HI> and so sets him forward to <HI>Ierusalem.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon the King of <HI>Babylon</HI> calls a Councell;
<PB REF="4">
where some grieue, others rage, all Hell rores, that they had lost a prisoner, of whom they lately thought themselues so sure. There is not more ioy with the <HI>Angels</HI> in heauen, then there is sorrow with the de|uils in hell, for this Sinners conuersion. But yet all is not well, as the Watchman certifies the King of Om|nipotence. The <HI>Souldier</HI> is mounted vpon <HI>Desire, Hope</HI> leads him, and <HI>Feare</HI> driues him amaine: but I doubt he comes too fast, because he hath neither <HI>Bri|dle</HI> nor <HI>Saddle.</HI> Hereon the Kings, that hath euerla|sting care of all Christian soules, sends forth two of his graue <HI>Councellors</HI> to him, <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI>; Temperance giues him a Bridle, that is <HI>Discretion</HI>; and Prudence a Saddle, that is <HI>Cir|cumspection.</HI> This is not all: <HI>Feare</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> giue him two Spurres; on the left heele <HI>Feare of punishment,</HI> on the right, <HI>Expectation of blisse. Knowledge</HI> cleares his <HI>Eye, Diligence</HI> opens his <HI>Eare, Obedience</HI> strengthens his <HI>Hand, Deuotion</HI> rectifies his <HI>Foot, Faith</HI> encourageth his <HI>Heart.</HI> And if he want any thing, <HI>Prayer</HI> offers him her seruice, to wait vpon him as a faithfull messenger; promising that whensoeuer he sends her to the King with a Petition, she will bring him backe a Benediction.</P>
<P>Thus as in a little Tablet you see the whole world; that all of vs must be Souldiers on earth militant,
<PB REF="4">
that will be Conquerors in heauen triumphant. But are there not enemies in the flesh, so well as enemies in the Spirit? Is mysticall armour only necessarie to a Christian, &amp; is there no vse of materiall? No; <HI>Aequu~|est Deum illis esse propitium, qui sibi non sunt aduersarij</HI>; it is iust, that God should be a friend to the~, that are not enemies to themselues. I know pray|ers are good weapons: and <HI>Exo.</HI> 17. there was more speed made to victorie by lifting vp of <HI>Moses</HI> hands, then of <HI>Ioshu</HI>'s word. He that would ouercome his enemies on earth, must first preuaile with his best friend in heauen. If the mercy &amp; strength of God be made thine by prayer, feare not the aduerse powers. Ro. 8. <HI>We shalbe conquerors through him that loued vs.</HI> But is it enough to bend the knee, without stirring the hand? Shall warre march against vs with thundering steps; &amp; shall we only assemble our selues in the Temples, lie prostrate on the pauements, lift vp our hands &amp; eyes to heauen, &amp; not our wea|pons against our enemies? Shal we beat the aire with our voices, and not their bosomes with our swords? only knock our own breasts, &amp; not knock their heads? Sure, a religious conscience neuer taught a man to neglect his life, his libertie, his estate, his peace. Pietie and Policie are not opposites: he that taught vs to be <HI>harmelesse as Doues,</HI> bad vs also <HI>be wise as Ser|pents.</HI>
<PB REF="5">
Giue way to a fiction: fables are not without their vsefull morals. A boy was molested with a dog; the Frier taught him to say a Gospell by heart, and warranted this to allay the dogs furie. The mastiffe spying the boy, flies at him: he begins (as it were) to coniure him with his Gospel. The dog (not capable of religion) approcheth more violently. A neighbor pas|sing by, bids the boy take vp a stone: he did so, and throwing at the dog, escaped. The Frier demands of the lad, how he sped with his charme. Sir (quoth he) your Gospel was good, but a stone with the Gospel did the deed. The Curs of Antichrist are not afraid of our Gospel, but of our stones: let vs fight, &amp; they wil flie.</P>
<P>Fight say you; why who strikes vs? Yeeld that no enemies doe, are we sure that none will doe? When our <HI>securitie</HI> hath made vs weake, &amp; their <HI>policie</HI> hath made the~ strong, we shal find the~ (like that trou|blesome neighbour) knocking at our dore early in the morning, before we are vp; when it wil be too late for vs to say, If we had known of your co~ming, we would haue prouided better cheare for you. They thank you, they wil take now such as they find, for they purpose to be their owne caruers, and the worst morsels they swallow shalbe your hearts. Let vs therfore like good housekeepers, who~ such vnbidde~ guests come, haue al|waies a breakfast ready for the~: which if we giue the~
<PB REF="5">
heartily, they shal haue smal stomach to their dinners.</P>
<P>Be you but ready for warre, and I durst warrant your peace. Whilst you are dissolute, they grow reso|lute. <HI>Ludouicus Viues</HI> reports, that the yong nobles and gallants in a citie of Spaine were falne to such le|uitie of carriage; that in stead of marching to the sound of a Drum, they were dancing leuolto's to the Lute in a Ladies chamber: their Beauers were tur|ned to Beuer hats. Euery one had his mistresse, and spent his time in courting <HI>Venus</HI>; but <HI>Mars</HI> was shut out at the backe gate. The ancient Magistrates obseruing this, consulted what should become of that country, which these men must gouerne after they were dead. Hereupon they conferred with the wo|men, their daughters, the Ladies: whom they instru|cted to forbeare their wonted fauours, to despise the fantasticall amorists, and to afford no grace to them that had no grace in themselues. This they obeyed di|ligently, and wrought so effectually, that the Gentle|men soone began to spie some difference betwixt Ef|feminatenes and Noblenes. And at last in honourable and seruiceable designes excelled all their Ancestors. If we had in England such Ladies, (though I doe not wish them from Spaine) wee should haue such Lords. Honour should goe by the Banner, not by the Barue: and Reputation be valued by valour, not
<PB REF="6">
measured by the acre: there would be no ambition to be carpet-Knights.</P>
<P>How necessarie the readinesse of Armes, and of men practised to those Armes, hath beene to the com|mon good; what Nation hath not found, either in the habite to their safetie, or in the priuation to their ruine? Onely we blesse our selues in our peace; and say to them that aduise vs to militarie preparations, as the Deuils said to Christ, that we come to torment them before their time. But let them rest, that thus will rust: and for your selues, worthy Gentlemen, keepe your Armes bright; and thereby your names, your vertues, your soules: you shall be honoured in good mens hearts, whilst wanton and effeminate Gulls shall weaue and weare their owne disgraces. <HI>Spernite vos sperni:</HI> there are none that think base|ly of you, whose bosomes are acquainted with other then ignoble thoughts. But I haue held you too long in the gates, vnlesse I could promise you the sight of a better Citie. Yet enter in, and view it with your eyes: it hath alreadie entred your eares; God grant it may enter all our hearts. So your selues shall be renowned, our Peace secured, and the Lords great Name glorified, through <HI>Iesus Christ.</HI></P>

<P>_IT was a custome in the Heathen world, after victorie to sing songs of Triumph.</P>
<P>This fashion was also obserued among the Iewes; as we frequently find it. After a great conquest of the Philistins, the people of <HI>Israel</HI> sung; <HI>Saul hath

slaine his thousand, and Dauid his ten thousand.</HI> When <HI>Ioshua</HI> had ouerthrowne those fiue Kings;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosh. 10.12.</NOTE> at whose prayer the Sunne stood still, and the day was made longer then euer the world saw before, or since; the people sung, <HI>The Sunne stood still in Gibeon, and the Moone in the valley of Aialon.</HI> When Israel had cros|sed the red Sea with drie feet, and the returning wa|ters had drowned their pursuing enemies; <HI>Moses</HI> and the people sung this Song,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 15.3.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord is a man of warre, the Lord is his Name, &amp;c.</HI> Here <HI>Debora</HI> hauing con|quered <HI>Sisera,</HI> with his nine hundred Chariots of yron, shee sung this triumphant Song to the Lord; <HI>Praise ye the Lord for the auenging of Israel: Heare O ye Kings, I will sing to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>I haue chosen two straines of this <HI>Song</HI>; from which, as they shall teach me, so I purpose to teach you, to blesse the Lord that teacheth vs all. So the Psalmist; <HI>It is the Lord that teacheth our hands to warre, and our fingers to fight.</HI> This Lord giue me a tongue to sing it, you eares to heare it, and vs all hearts to embrace it.</P>
<P>In all I obserue two generals, which expresse the nature of the two verses. There is great Affliction. There is great Affection.</P>
<P>The Affliction; <HI>They chose new gods: then was warre in the gates,</HI> &amp;c. The Affection; <HI>My heart is toward the Gouernours of Israel, that offered themselues willingly a|mong the people: Blesse ye the Lord.</HI> In the Affliction, me thinkes I find three points of warre:

<P><HI>They chose new gods.</HI> Their Idolatrie may be aggra|uated by three circumstances or degrees. They are all declining, and downewards: there is <HI>Malum, Pe|ius, Pessimum</HI>; euill, worse, and worst of all.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They chose.</HI> Here is <HI>Electio, non compulsio</HI>; a franke choise, no compelling: They voluntarily tooke to themselues, and betooke themselues to o|ther gods. <HI>Naaman</HI> begged mercie for a sinne, to which he seemes enforced, if he would reserue the fauour of his King, and peace of his estate: and there|fore cryed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.

<Q><L>Immemsus Deus est, quia scilicet omnia mensus.</L>
<L>Innumerabilis est, vnus enim Deus est.</L></Q>
Sayes the Epigrammatist. God is therefore innume|rable, because he is but one. It was for the Heathen, that had (saith <HI>Augustine) mentes amentes,</HI> intoxicate minds and reprobate hearts, to haue <HI>plurimos deos,</HI> a multitude of gods.

<P>These be the wretched degrees of Israels sinne: God keepe <HI>England</HI> from such Apostacie. We haue one God: let the <HI>Romists</HI> chuse them another: as the Canonists style their Pope, <HI>Dominus Deus noster Papa</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4.6.</NOTE> our Lord God the Pope.

<P>The people of Israel, when they had turned beast, and calued an Idoll, cryed in triumph, <HI>These are thy gods,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 32.4.</NOTE><HI>O Israel.</HI> So we may speake it with horror and amazement of soule, of these three Idols; <HI>These are

<P N="1">1. That warre at some times is iust and necessa|rie; indeed iust when it is necessarie; as here. For shall it come to the <HI>gates,</HI> and shall we not meet it? Yea shall wee not meet it before it come neere the <HI>gates?</HI> There is then a season when warre is good and lawfull.

The exercises of warre steppe in here, to challenge their deserued praise. As with woodden wasters men learne to play at the sharpe: so practise in times of peace makes readie for the time of warre. It is good to be doing, that when Satan comes, <HI>inueniat occupatum</HI>; he may find thee honestly busied.

so faire a marke of vs: but idle, we lie prostrate ob|iects to all the shot of his temptations. Now there are two cautions obserueable in the iustnesse of warres. 1. that they be vndertaken <HI>iusta causa,</HI> vpon iust and warrantable cause. 2. that they be prosecu|ted <HI>bono animo,</HI> with an honest mind.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Cause</HI> must be iust. For
<Q><P>Frangit &amp; attollit vires in milite causa.</P></Q>
The cause doth either encourage or discourage the
souldier, indeede it makes or marres all. This iust
cause is threefold, well comprised in that verse,
<Q><P>Paxpopuli, Patriaeque salus, &amp; Gloria Regni.</P></Q>
The peace of the people, the health of the Coun|trey,
and the glorie of the Kingdome.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Peace</HI> of the people: for wee must aime by warre to make way for peace. We must not de|sire truce to this end, that wee may gather force a|gainst an vniust warre: but wee desire a iust warre, that wee may settle a true peace.

<P>If ware should be in the <HI>gates,</HI> whither would you runne for defence, where shrowd your selues, but vnder their Colours which you haue despised? Who should keepe the Vsurers money from pilla|ging? all his Obligations, Morgages, and Statutes from burning? Who should keepe the foggie Epi|cure, in his soft chaire after a full meale fast asleepe? Who should maintaine the nice Ladie in her Ca|roch, whirling through the popular streetes? Who should reserue those delicate parlours, and adorned chambers from fire and flames? Who should saue Virgins from rauishment, children from famish|ment, mothers from astonishment? Citie &amp; Coun|trey, Temples and Pallaces, Traffickes and Mar|kets, Ships and Shops; Westminster-hall and the Exchange, two of the richest acres of ground in England, from plowing vp; from hauing it said, <HI>I am seges vbi Troia fuit,</HI> corne groweth were Lon|don stood; all from ruine; who but the Souldier vnder God?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg. 7.18.</NOTE> <HI>The sword of God, and the sword of Gideon?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Glorie of the Kingdome, and that is <HI>E|uangelium Christi,</HI> the Gospel of <HI>Iesus</HI> Christ. Warres for God are called Gods battells. The destruction of their cities that reuolt from God to Idols, and the whole spoile, is for the Lord: it is the Lords battell, and the Lords spoile. Deut. 13. <HI>Saul</HI> thus encoura|ged <HI>Dauid</HI> to warre;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sam. 18.17.</NOTE> <HI>Be thou valiant for me, and fight the Lords battells.</HI> The most and best warriours
<PB N="21" REF="16">
were called the Sonnes of God.

<P>When therefore there is hazard to loose the <HI>peace</HI> of the people, the <HI>safetie</HI> of the Countrey, the <HI>glorie</HI> of all, the Gospel of our Sauiour Christ; here is iust cause of warre. They that goe forth to fight vpon these termes, shall conquer.
<Q><P>Causa iubet melior superos sperare secundos.</P></Q>
A good cause giues assurance of victorie. God shall
martiall that armie, yea himselfe will sight for them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The next caution, after a good ingression, is to be sure of a good prosecution. Wee say of the Chirurgion, that he should haue a Ladies hand, and a Lyons heart: but the Christian souldier should haue a Ladies heart, and a Lyons hand. I meane, though hee deale valiant blowes, yet not destroy without compassion. <HI>Fortitudo virtus bellica, man sue|tudo virtus bella.</HI> Though manfulnesse be a warlike vertue, yet gentlenesse is a Christian vertue. The sword should not bee bloudied, but in the heat of battell. And after victorie, when a souldier lookes on the dead bodies of his enemies, pittie should sit in his eyes rather then insultation. Hee should not strike the yeelding, nor prey vpon prostrate fortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="17">I know that diuers aspersions are cast vpon men of this ranke, They thinke that manie take armes, <HI>Non vt seruiant, sed vt soeuiant</HI>; not to serue for their Countrey, but to rage and forrage: making their Cote-armour a defence for drinking, whoring, swearing, dicing; and such disorders. As if it were imposible, that a tender conscience should dwell in one bosome with a valiant heart.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Isidor.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Olim castra quasi casta dicebantur; quia castratur in ijs libido.</HI> The Campe seemed to take the denomination, saith hee, from chastitie; because in the warres lust was bea|ten downe.

<HI>Cupid</HI> hath displayed his Colours, and pitched his
Tent in the midst of the Armie; as if it were the
onely brauerie of a Souldier, to drinke valiant

that though they are the most monstrous beasts at
home in peace, and sinne euen against nature: yet
in warres <HI>caute &amp; caste viuunt,</HI> they liue charily and
chastly. Not as the Fryers say, <HI>Caute si non caste:</HI> the
Turkes are better then the Fryers in this. <HI>Vitia sua
domi deponunt,</HI> saith hee: they leaue all their naugh|tinesse
behind them at home. But he addes withall
to our reproch, <HI>Christianus assumit:</HI> the Christi|ans
there take vp those vices, as if they found them
sowne in a pitched field. That there is often,
saith he, <HI>Grauior turba meretricum, quam militum:</HI>
it is hard to iudge, whether the number of soul|diers
<PB N="23" REF="17">
or of harlots be greater. Hence it is said,
that
<Q><P>Rara fides pietasque viris, qui castra sequuntur.</P></Q>
There is so little fidelitie and pietie in men that fol|low
the warres. These be the common inuectiues
against Souldiers.</P>
<P>But now doe not manie taxe them, that are worse themselues? Who can endure to heare an Vsurer taxe a Pillager? an Epicure find fault with a Drinker? a man-eating Oppressor with a ga|ming Souldier?
<Q><P>Quis tulerit Gracchum de seditione loquentem?</P></Q>
Who can abide to heare <HI>Gracchus</HI> declaine against
sedition? or the Foxe preach peace to the Geese?
Say that some are faultie: must therefore the whole
Profession be scandalized? Will you despise the
word of God, because some that preach it are wic|ked
men? no;
<Q><L>Dent ocyus omnes,</L>
<L>Quas meruere pati, sic stet sententia poenas.</L></Q>
Lay the fault where it should lie: be they onely bla|med
that deserued it. Some persons may be reproue|able,
but the Profession is honourable.</P>

a <HI>Warfare.</HI> His continuall dangers to the good soul|dier, are as it were so many meditations of death. If he die in peace, he falls breast to breast with vertue. If in warre, yet he dies more calmely then many an V|surer doth in his chamber. Though he be conque|red, yet he is a Conqueror: he may loose the day in an earthly field, but he winnes the day against Sinne, Satan, and Hell; and sings with <HI>Paul,</HI> like a dying Swan;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.

<P N="2">2. The other inference that may hence be dedu|ced, is this, That Munition and Armes should at all times be in readinesse. How grieuous was it, when <HI>Iabin</HI> had such an Host, and not a <HI>shield</HI> or <HI>speare a|mong fortie thousand in Israel?</HI> For our selues, wee haue not our Peace by Patent; we know not how long it will continue: let vs prouide for Warre, in trayning vp some to militarie practises. If Warre doe come, it is a labour well spent: if Warre doe not come, it is a labour very well lost. Wise men in faire weather repaire their houses a|gainst Winter stormes; the Ant labours in haruest, that she may feast at Christmasse.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sen.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Diu apparandum est bellum, vt vincas celerius</HI>; Be long in preparing for warre, that thou mayest ouercome with more speed: <HI>Longa belli praeparatio celerem facit victori|am</HI>; A long preparation makes a short and quicke victorie.</P>
<P>Tut wee say, if that day comes, wee shall haue Souldiers enow; wee will all fight. <HI>O dulce bellum
<PB N="25" REF="18">

<P>Could any tongue forbeare to taxe the rich men of this honourable Citie, if their houses be al|together furnished with Plate, Hangings, and Car|pets, and not at all with Weapons and Armour, to defend the Common-wealth? How fondly doe they loue their Riches, that will not lay out a little to secure the rest? When the Turke inuaded the Greeke Empire; before the siege was layed to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the Metropolitane Citie, the Em|perour sollicites the subiects to contribute some|what to the repaire of the walls, and such milita|rie prouision and preuention: But the subiects drew backe, and pleaded want. Hereupon the Turke enters, and conquers: and in ransacking the Ci|tie, when he found such aboundance of wealth in priuate houses, hee lift vp his hands to Heauen, and blessed himselfe, that they had so much riches, and would suffer themselues to be taken, for not vsing them.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="19">So if euer London should be surprised by her enemies, which the wonted mercies of our God defend for euer; would they not wonder to finde such infinite treasures in your priuate houses, when yet you spent none of them to prouide shield or speare, munition to defend your selues? What scope can you imagine, or propound to your owne hearts wherein your riches may doe you seruice? You can tell me, nay I can tell you. You reserue one bagge for pride, another for belly-cheare, another for lust, yet another for contention and sutes in law. O the madnesse of vs Englishmen! wee care not what wee spend in ciuill iarres, that yet will spend nothing to avoid forraine warres. They say, the Iew will spend all on his Pasches, the Barbarian on his Nuptialls, and the Christian on his quarrels, or law|sutes. We need not make our selues enemies by our riches, we haue enow made to our hands. Christ sayes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 16.9.</NOTE> <HI>Make you friends of the Mammon of vnrighte|ousnesse.</HI> Make to your selues friends by your cha|ritie, not aduersaries by your litigation. <HI>Seeke peace,</HI> saith the Prophet, and <HI>pursue it</HI>: seeke peace, warre will come fast enough. And if it doe come, it will hardly bee made welcome. The Spaniards haue often threatned, often assaulted; euer beene preuented, euer infatuated. Take we heed, if they doe preuaile, they will be reuenged once for all. God grant we neuer trie their mercie. Whether they come like Lyons rampant, or like Foxes pas|sant, or like Dogges couchant, they intend nothing but our ruine and desolation.</P>

onely by way of exhortation. <HI>My heart is set on the Gouernours of Israel, that offered themselues willing|ly among the people: Blesse ye the Lord.</HI> Here is con|siderable
<LIST>
<ITEM>Both <HI>Subiectum in Quo.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Both <HI>Obiectum in Quod.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
The Subiect in which this <HI>Affection</HI> resides: and the Obiect on which this <HI>Affection</HI> reflects.</P>
<P>The Subiect wherein it abides is <HI>Cor,</HI> the <HI>Heart:</HI> a great zeale of loue. Not onely <HI>Affectio cordis,</HI> but <HI>Cor affectionis:</HI> not onely the Affection of the <HI>Heart,</HI> but the <HI>Heart</HI> of Affection. <HI>My heart is set.</HI></P>
<P>The Obiect on which it reflects is double; Man and God, the excellent creature, and the most ex|cellent Creator: the men of God, and the God of men. Vpon <HI>Men; My heart is towards the Gouernours of Israel, that offered themselues willingly among the peo|ple.</HI> Vpon <HI>God; Blesse ye the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Among men two sorts are obiected to this loue: Superiors in the first place, Inferiors in the later. To the Commanders primarily, but not onely: for if they offered themselues willingly among the peo|ple, as we reade it: then certainely the people also willingly offered themselues, as the other translati|ons reade it: <HI>Those that were willing amongst the peo|ple.</HI> You see, here is a foundation laid for a great and ample building of discourse; but I know you looke to the glasse, therefore promise nothing but application. And that</P>
<P N="1">1. To the <HI>Gouernours</HI> of our Israel; that they of|fer

themselues <HI>willingly</HI> to these militarie designes: not on compulsion; <HI>Quoniam probitate coacta, gloria nulla venit.</HI> His brows deserue no wreathed Coronet that is enforced: come with a <HI>willing</HI> mind. In euerie good worke there must be <HI>Sollicitudo in effectu,</HI> and <HI>Feruor in affectu:</HI> cheerefulnesse in the affection, and carefulnesse in the action. <HI>God loues a cheerefull giuer:</HI> so thou gainest no small thing by it, but euen the loue of God. Whatsoeuer good thing thou doest, saith <HI>Augustine,</HI> doe it cheerefully and willingly, and thou doest it well. <HI>Si autem cum tristitia facis, de te sit, non tu facis:</HI> if thou doest it heauily and grudg|ingly, it is wrought vpon thee, not by thee: thou art rather the patient then the agent in it. God could neuer endure a luke-warme affection. Reuelat. 3. No man was admitted to offer to the building of the Tabernacle, that did it grudgingly. <HI>Of euery man that giueth it willingly with his heart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 25.2</NOTE> <HI>ye shall take my of|fering.</HI> In all thy gifts shew a cheerefull counte|nance, saith the <HI>Wiseman:</HI> in all, whether to God or man. Saint <HI>Chrysostome</HI> giues the reason; <HI>Cum tali vultu respicit Deus, cum quali tu facis.</HI>God respects it with such a countenance as thou performest it. Gods seruice is <HI>Libera seruitus,</HI> where not necessitie but charitie serues. <HI>Non complacet Deo famulatus coactus.</HI> God could neuer endure forc'd seruice. Doe all then with willingnesse of heart.</P>

The fame of <HI>Alexander</HI> gaue heart to <HI>Iulius Caesar,</HI> to be the more noble a warriour. Let the conside|ration of their valour teach you to shake off cowar|dize. They fought the battells, that you might en|ioy the peace. You holde it an honour to beare Armes in your Scutchions; and is it a dishonour to beare Armes in the Field? The time hath beene, when all honour in England came <HI>a Marte</HI> or <HI>Mer|curio</HI>; from Learning or Chiualrie, from the Pen or the Pike, from Priesthood or Knighthood.</P>
<P>It would bee an vnknowne encouragement to goodnesse, if honour still might not bee dealed but vpon those termes. Then should manie worthie spirits get vp the High-gate of preferment: and idle Drones should not come neerer then the Dunstable high-way of obscuritie. It was a monstrous storie, that <HI>Nicippus</HI> his Sheepe did bring forth a Lyon: but it is too true, that manie of our English Lyons haue brought forth Sheepe. Among birds you shall neuer see a Pigeon hatch'd in an Eagles neast: a|mong men you shall often see noble progenitors bring forth ignoble cowards.</P>
<P>But let vertue be renowned, rewarded, wheresoe|uer shee dwells. Though <HI>Bion</HI> was the sonne of a Courtesan, I hope no man will censure him with <HI>Partus sequitur ventrem. Non genus sed genius: non gens sed mens.</HI> Neuer speake of thy bloud, but of thy good: not of thy Nobilitie, thou art beholding to thy friends for it, but of thy vertue. Euen the Duke fetcheth the honour of his name from the warres; and is but <HI>Dux,</HI> a Captaine. And it seemes
<PB N="31" REF="21">
the difference was so small betweene a Knight and a common Souldier, among the Romanes; that they had but one word, <HI>Miles,</HI> to expresse both their names.</P>
<P>You then that haue the places of Gouernment in this honourable Citie, <HI>offer willingly</HI> your hands, your purses, your selues, to this noble Exercise. Your good example shall hearten others: be not a|shamed to be seene among the people; vpon such did <HI>Debora</HI> set her heart. <HI>Alexander</HI> would vsually call his meanest souldiers, friends and companions. <HI>Tullie</HI> writes of <HI>Caesar,</HI> that he was neuer heard spea|king to his Souldiers; <HI>Ite illuc,</HI> Goe thither: but <HI>Ve|nite hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> come hither: I will goe with you. The infe|rior thinkes that labour much easier, which hee sees his Captaine take before him. <HI>Malus miles qui Impe|ratorem gemens sequitur:</HI> Hee is an ill Souldier that followes a good Leader with a dull pace. So <HI>Gedeon</HI> to his Souldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg. 7.17.</NOTE> Iudg. 7. <HI>Looke on me, and do likewise: when I come to the outside of the Campe, it shall be that as I doe, so shall yee doe.</HI> So <HI>Abimelech</HI> to his men of Armes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg. 9.48.</NOTE> Iudg. 9. <HI>What yee haue seene me doe, make hast, and doe as I haue done.</HI> The good Captaine is first in giuing the charge, and last in retiring his foote. Hee endures equall toile with the common Souldiers: from his example they all take fire, as one Torch lighteth many. And so much for the <HI>Gouernours.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Now for you that are the materialls of all this, let me say to you without flatterie&punc; Goe forth with courage in the feare of God, and the Lord be with you. Preserue vnitie among your selues: left as
<PB N="32" REF="22">
in a Towne on fire, whiles all good hands are hel|ping to quench it, theeues are most busie to steale booties: So whilst you contend, murmur, or repine one at the honour of another, that subtile theefe Satan, through the cracke of your diuisions, step in, and steale away your peace.</P>
<P><HI>Offer</HI> your selues <HI>willingly</HI>; and being offered step not backe. Remember that <HI>Turpe est militem fugere</HI>; it is base for a Souldier to flye. When <HI>Bias</HI> was en|uironed with his enemies, and his souldiers asked him, what shall we doe? He replyed, Goe ye and tell the liuing that I die fighting, and I will tell the dead that you did scape flying. Our Chronicles report, that when <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror landed at <HI>Pemsey</HI> neere to Hastings in Sussex, hee commanded all his ships to be sunke: that all hope of returning backe might be frustrate. You haue begun well; goe on, be perfect, be blessed.</P>
<P>And remember alwayes the burden of this song, which euerie thing that hath breath must sing; <HI>Blesse ye the Lord.</HI> Those <HI>heauenly Souldiers</HI> that waited on the natiuitie of <HI>Iesus</HI> Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke. 2.13.</NOTE> sung this song; <HI>Glorie be to God on high.</HI> Vpon this Lord the <HI>heart</HI> of <HI>Debora,</HI> of Israel, of vs all, should be set. It is he that teacheth vs to fight, and fighteth for vs.</P>
<P>To conclude with an obseruation of a reuerend Diuine: England was said to haue a warlike Saint, <HI>George</HI>; but <HI>Bellarmine</HI> snibbes <HI>Iacobus de Voragine</HI> for his leaden Legend of our English <HI>George.</HI> And o|thers haue inueighed against the authentike truth of that storie.

<PB N="33" REF="22">
England of her Saint. Saint <HI>Iames</HI> is for Spaine, Saint <HI>Denis</HI> for France, Saint <HI>Patricke</HI> for Ireland; other Saints are allotted and allowed for other Countreyes: onely poore England is bereaued of her <HI>George:</HI> they leaue none but God to reuenge our quarrells. I thinke it is a fauour and an honour, and wee are bound to thanke them for it. Let them take their Saints, giue vs the Lord; <HI>Blesse ye the Lord.</HI> So let vs pray with our Church, <HI>Giue peace in our time O Lord; for there is none that fighteth for vs, but thou O God.</HI> To this mercifull God be all glorie, obedience, and thanksgi|uing, now and for euer.
