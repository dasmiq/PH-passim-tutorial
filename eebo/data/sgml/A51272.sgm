<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>I Easily foresee some People will be disobli|ged
with the Freedom of these Papers,
and think themselves treated with too
little Ceremony; But unless they can dis|arm
their pretended Adversary, and confute
his Arguments, I would desire them by all means
to smother their Resentments: For as bad as
the World is, to appear in defence of Pride, and
turn Advocate for the Devil, looks like an un|toward
sort of an Employment. However to
sweeten their Humour as much as may be, they
may please to consider that there was no good
to be done in this Case without plain dealing;
This Malady of all others must be well ex|amined,
otherwise it's in vain to expect a Cure.
'Tis to no purpose to declaim in general
against a Proud man, and to give him a great
many hard Names; for unless you point di|rectly
upon his Vice, distinguish it's Nature,
and discover the weakness of that which he
builds upon. Every one will be sure to avoid
the Charge and parry against the Application.
Farther, to abate their Censure I think it not
<PB REF="3">
improper to acquaint them that here are no
particular Characters attempted, nor is there
the least intention to provoke or expose any
Person Living. Besides when a Piece like this
is drawn from so many different Faces; the
mixing of Features and Complexions, will keep
the <HI>Originals</HI> from being discover'd. In short
the Design of this small Discourse is only to
make Men more useful and acceptable to Soci|ety,
and more easie to themselves than they
generally are: And that those who over-top
their Neighbours upon any considerable account;
may manage their Advantage with that Mo|desty
and good Humour, that none may have
any just occasion to wish them less.</P>

<HEAD>A
Moral Essay
UPON
PRIDE,
IN A
CONFERENCE
Between
PHILOTIMUS and PHILALETHES.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>PHilalethes,</HI> I am glad to see
you, though you are so wrapt
up in Speculation that I scarce
knew you at first sight; pray
why so thoughtful? you don't use to have so
much Philosophy in your Face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a particular reason to look
a little pretendingly at present; therefore I
hope you will excuse it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, for I suppose
you will not make a practice of it: But what|ever
<PB N="2" REF="4">
Emergency you may be under, I would
advise you to appear in your old shape a|gain;
for in my Judgment that contempla|tive
Figure does not become you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry to hear Thinking agrees
so ill with my Constitution; but I hope this
Alteration does not arise from any natural
Antipathy I have to Sense, but from the un|acceptableness
of the subject I am upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray if it be not too free a Que|stion,
what were you musing upon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why last night I happened to light
upon an overgrown Fop, who plagued the
Company with such an impertinent History
of his Quality and Performances, and was so
vain and insolent in all his behaviour, that
as soon as I was delivered from him, I had
a plentiful occasion to consider the unreason|ableness
of Pride; which is the present Em|ployment
of my Thoughts, and upon a full
view, I find so much folly, and ill humour,
and Monster, in the Composition of this
Vice, that I am ashamed, and almost afraid,
of the <HI>Idea</HI> I have raised.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis somewhat hard you can't
stand the charge of your own Imagination;
But though I shall not dispute your Courage,
yet I much question your Mortification.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Reason of your censure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I have observed it's but
a bad Sign of Humility to declaim against
<PB N="3" REF="4">
Pride; for he that is really humble will be
unconcerned about Respect and Applause;
such a Person values himself upon nothing
but his Conscience and Integrity, and there|fore
the haughtiness of another can't make
him uneasie; so that if he finds himself wince
upon the account of neglect, he may be
pretty well assured he has a fore place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you are somewhat out in
your notion of Humility; for that virtue
does not make us either servile or insensible,
it does not oblige us to be ridden at the
pleasure of every Coxcomb. We may shew
our dislike of an imperious humour, as well
as of any other foolish Action, both for the
Benefit of others, and in vindication of our
own right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear this concession
from you, because from hence it follows that
a man may have a just esteem of himself
without being proud: Now if this observa|tion
was remembred and rightly applyed,
men would not be so censorious in this point,
nor mistake their own Pride for their neigh|bours
so often as they do. For instance, a
man whom the Law has made my Superi|our,
may take notice of his Quality if he
pleases; but this can't well be done, except
he makes me an abatement of the regard he
receives from me, therefore I ought not to in|terpret
the <HI>Reserve</HI> or <HI>Familiarity</HI> of his Car|riage
<PB N="4" REF="5">
as a Neglect, for provided he keeps
within his proportion, he challenges nothing
but his own; so that if I am displeased, the
Pride lies on my side, for affecting to have
an equal Regard paid to persons who are un|equal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have nothing to object against
the main of your discourse, and conceive
that the best way to know whether we are
guilty or not, and to prevent charging this
odious Imputation unjustly upon others, is
to state the Nature of Pride, and to enquire
into the Grounds of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess that is the way to pinch
the Question, therefore let what will come of
it, I will stand the Test of your Method,
though I am afraid you will say some un|acceptable
things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose I do; if the subject leads me
to it, the fault is not mine: But to come
to the point: Pride has a very strong Founda|tion
in the mind; it's bottom'd upon Self-love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I find there is somewhat to
work upon.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray give me leave, I say Pride is
originally founded in Self-love, which is the
most intimate and inseparable Passion of hu|mane
Nature. The kindness men have for
themselves, is apt to put them upon over|valuing
their own things: which humour un|less
<PB N="5" REF="5">
check'd in time, will make them take
most delight in those Circumstances and Acti|ons
which distinguish them from their Neigh|bours;
and place their supposed Advantages
in the best light. Now this design is best
pursued by being Master of uncommon Ex|cellencies,
which though desired by all, are
possessed but by a few; for the Rareness
of things raises their Esteem, and draws a
general Admiration. And their desire of be|ing
distinguish'd, is one reason why they love
to keep the odds in their own hand, and to
make the distance between themselves and
their Neighbours as wide as may be, which
often runs them upon a vain, and tyranni|cal
Ostentation of their Power, Capacity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
For this magnificent discovery makes the
difference between them and their Neigh|bours
the more apparent, and consequently
occasions their own Greatness to be the more
remarkable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you have said something
very remarkable, and I don't know but you
may grow considerable by it, if you can prove
your Assertion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what rising Doctrine have I
laid down?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say that Pride is founded in
Self-love, which is an unseparable Passion of
humane nature; from whence I gather, that
it's impossible for a man not to be proud, be|cause
<PB N="6" REF="6">
it's impossible for a man not to love
himself. We are like to have an admirable
Preservative from you at this rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so fast, If you had attended
to the whole, you might have observed that
by self-love I meant the Excesses of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought a Man could not have
loved himself too well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>If by loving you mean wishing him|self
happy, I agree with you; for we may, or
rather we must desire to be as happy as is
possible, provided it be without prejudice to
another. But then if Esteem is understood
by Love, it's easie (without care) to exceed
in our own behalf; and in this sense we cer|tainly
do love our selves too well, as often
as we set an overproportioned and unusual
value upon any thing because it's our own;
as if our fondness and partiality was the true
Standard of worth, and we had the faculty
of turning every thing we touched into gold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not contest this point any
farther with you; but as I remember you
started another Paradox, by intimating that
it was a sign of Ambition to esteem any
Excellency the higher for being uncommon:
Now since the value of an Advantage is en|hansed
by its scarceness, and made more re|putable
to the owner; I think it somewhat
hard not to give a man leave to love that
most which is most serviceable to him,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it would if he had no body to
love but himself; but since he is both obliged
and naturally inclinable to universal Benevo|lence,
this alters the Case: for he who va+lues
any thing the more for being uncommon,
will desire it should continue so, which is no
kind Wish to his Neighbours, and is an Ar|gument
that a man does not delight in an
Advantage so much for it self, as for the
Comparison; not so much for its own irres|pective
goodness, as because others want it.
Now it affords a more generous, and I be|lieve,
a more transporting pleasure, to con|verse
with universal Happiness, though we
make no greater figure in it, than the rest of
our Neighbours; than to be gazed at, and
admired by a Crowd of indigent and infe|riour
People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>The World does not seem to be
of your opinion; however I will let your
Argument pass for the good nature of it.
But after all let me tell you, though I have
no mind to be counted proud, yet I have
a strong fancy for myself, and therefore if
you will not allow me to be civil to my
Person, we might e'en as good dispute no
farther, for&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't trouble your self, if your
Terms are moderate, we'll never break off
upon the score, therefore I will offer at a
short negative description of Pride, in which
<PB N="8" REF="7">
if it's possible, I will give you Satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray let us see how liberal you
will be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>First it's no part of Pride to be
conscious of any perfections we have, whe|ther
intellectual or moral; for this is in ma|ny
Cases necessary, and impossible to be a|voided.
He that is wise or learned must know
it, otherwise he can't understand when he
judges true or false, nor distinguish difficult
and noble Speculations, from trifling and
vulgar Remarks, nor tell when he acts ratio|nally
or not. Now a Man that is ignorant
of these things can neither be wise nor know|ing:
Therefore as he that has a just and vi|gorous
sense of the Magnitude, Distance and
Colours of Objects, must conclude that he
has eyes whether he will or not; so these
perfections of the mind discover themselves
by their own Light. The Possessour can no
more be ignorant of them, than he can doubt
of his Existence when he is awake. To give
one instance more; How can any Person have
true Fortitude, who does not know how far
he ought to hazard himself, and wherein the
baseness of Cowardise consists? So that to
affirm a Man may be ignorant of his own con|siderableness,
is to make him wise and great,
and good by Chance, which is a contradicti|tion
to the Excellencies supposed in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right. And since I like the Frank|ness,
and tendency of your Argument, I'll
try if I can reinforce it: I say then, suppo|sing
it was possible for a man to be ignorant
of his good Qualities; it was by no means
convenient: For if he carried such a Trea|sure
about him, without knowing how well
furnished he was; its somewhat hard to con|ceive,
how he could either improve or use
it. If it lay thus close, it would be little bet|ter,
than a Mine undiscovered, for which nei|ther
the owner of the Ground, or any Bo|dy
else are ever the richer,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say well, and therefore I shall
venture in the second place to affirm, That
as we may be acquainted with our own Ac|complishments,
without being guilty of Pride,
so neither is it any branch of this sin to
discover that they are greater than some of
our Neighbours enjoy. If we have a real
Advantage over another, it's no sin to be sen|sible
of it; to apprehend otherwise, is to judge
contrary to the Reason of things, when the
Case is plain, we may believe we have more
Honesty, Sense, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than some others. This
is as allowable as it is for us to think, that
we have better Complexions than Moors, and
are taller than Pygmies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you go on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I'm not afraid to add, Third|ly,
that we don't fall into the sin of Pride,
<PB N="10" REF="8">
by being delighted with those Advantages
of Mind, Body or Fortune, which Providence
has given us; these things in the very notion
of them are supposed to be beneficial. Now
it's natural and necessary for us to be pleased
with the Enjoyment of that which is good; of
that which is agreeable to our Faculties, and an
Advancement of our Nature: To speak strict|ly,
when the Faculty and the Object are
rightly proportioned, Satisfaction follows of
course, and its as impossible for us not to be
pleased, as it is for fire not to ascend: Far|ther,
if we are not allowed to take any Sa|tisfaction
in our condition, we are not bound
to give God thanks for it,; for we are not
obliged to be thankful for that which does
us no good: But nothing can do us any good,
except it be by giving us a pleasure either
in hand or in prospect. Fourthly, it is no
part of Pride, to be more pleased with hav|ing
an Advantage our selves, than by seeing
one of the same value possessed by another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make this out and you will o|blige
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well: I prove my Proposition
thus. First, Because that which is in our
Possession, or incorporated into our Essence, is
always in our Power, and ready to be made use
of when we think fit. But that which belongs
to another is often at a distance, and out of our
reach, and can't be communicated to us, though
<PB N="11" REF="8">
the owner was never so willing. Secondly, it
must be more agreeable to be Master of any
perfection our selves, than to contemplate
one of the same nature in another; because
every one is more certain of the kind Incli|nation
he has to himself, than he can be of
the Affection of any other Person whatever:
That I will be always kind to my self, I am
as well assured of, as that I have a being;
but that another will be so, is impossible for
me to know: And therefore let a man be
never so good natured, it must be somewhat
more satisfactory to him, to see himself well
furnished in any kind, than his Neighbour.
Thirdly, that which is our own and in
our Nature, we have the most intimate
and vigorous sense of; for the presence
of any desirable Object, we know is more
acceptable and entertaining than either the
notion or Prospect of it: Possession gives us
the Life of the thing, But hopes and Fancy
can furnish out no more at the best than a
Picture finely drawn. So that, for Example,
let a man be of never so generous and disin|terested
a Spirit, yet it's natural for him to
be better pleased, with being rich himself (if he
has any value for riches) than in having
the bare Idea of an Estate: Besides as I ob|served,
that which is our own, is always
at our disposal, and does not depend upon
the uncertain Inclination and humour of an|other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very comfortably argued. I find
then by your discourse that a Man may with|out
vanity be pleased with his Circumstan|ces,
and have good Thoughts of himself too,
if he deserves it. Now some People are so
unreasonable, that they will neither give
Men leave to love, nor understand them|selves;
if they are conscious of any commend|able
Quality, they must be sure to lay it out
of the way that they may not see it; nay
if a Man has taken never so much care to
make himself insignificant, in order to the
promoting of Humility, they will scarce let
him know he is good for nothing, for fear
he should grow conceited of his Virtue. But
I perceive you are not so strait laced, and
pedantick in your Notions. Therefore if
you can recover us no more Ground, let
us know directly what Pride is, and be as
fair as you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Pride in the plainest words
which I can think of, is too high an Opini|on
of our own Excellency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shall we know when we o|ver-rate
our selves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a very seasonable question,
and absolutely necessary to the state of the
Case: Therefore I shall lay down some indis|putable
Marks of this Vice, that whenever
we see the Tokens we may conclude the
Plague is in the House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us hear your Diagnosticks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, Then we may be assured
we have this Disease, when we value any
Person chiefly because his advantages are of
the same nature with those we enjoy, neg|lecting
others who have an equal right to
Regard, only because their Privileges are of a
different kind from our own. For instance,
when Men who derive their considerableness
from the Sword, the Gown, or their An|cestours,
think none worthy their Esteem
but such as claim under their own Preten|ces;
In this case it's evident it can be nothing
but Partiality and Conceitedness which makes
them give the Preheminence.</P>
</SP>
<P>Secondly, We may certainly conclude our
selves infected with this Vice, when we in|vade
the Rights of our Neighbour, not upon
the account of Covetousness, but of Domini|on;
only that we may have it in our power
to create Dependencies, and to give another
that which is already his own.</P>
<P>Thirdly, When Men don't measure their
civil Advantages by the Laws of their Coun|try,
but by their own fancies, and the sub|missions
of Flatterers; this is another infal|lible
sign they are Proud.</P>
<P>Fourthly, to mention no more, When Men
love to make themselves the subject of dis|course:
To conn over their Pedigrees, and
obtrude the Blazon of their exploits upon
<PB N="14" REF="10">
the company; this is an argument they are
overgrown with conceit, and very much
smitten with themselves.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though I think you have hit the
symptoms pretty well, yet except they are
marked somewhat more distinctly, 'tis possible
for a Man to have most of them without be|ing
e'er the wiser. For unless we are able
to draw up a just State of the Degrees of
merit, we can never take the true height of
our Pretensions, and being in this uncertainty
it's odds if self Love does not make us deter|mine
to the prejudice of our Neighbours.
Now I would gladly know how we must go
to work to be sufficiently informed in this
Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must endeavour to get right
apprehensions of the several Excellencies of
humane Nature, and what proportion they
hold to each other: In order to the assisting
our Judgment in this case I shall lay down
these general rules.</P>
</SP>
<P>First, Those advantages which spring from
our selves, which are the effects of our power
and courage, of our Industry or Understan|ding,
are more valuable than those which
are derived, and borrowed, because they are
a sign of a Richer and more active nature.</P>
<P>Secondly, Those Qualities which are most
useful ought to have the Preference: for
since acknowledgments ought to be suitable
<PB N="15" REF="10">
to the nature of benefits received, those who
have the largest Capacity of obliging, may
fairly challenge the Perheminence in our E|steem;
and therefore in the third place the
duration of an advantage ought to be con|sider'd;
And that which has the firmest Con|stitution
and is most likely to continue, ought
to be prefer'd to others which are brittle and
short lived. These rules carefully apply'd
will snew us how far our pretensions to Re|gard
are short of, or exceed other Mens, and
so prevent an over-weening opinion of our
selves. However, we are to observe that
outward Respect ought to be given according
to the Distinctions of; Law, and though a
Man may happen to be very defective in
point of merit, yet we ought to take notice
of the value Authority has set upon him.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me leave to put in a word,
which is to tell you, that though I am not
satisfied with your Instances, yet I am glad
to find you will allow us different degrees
of worth. I was almost afraid you would
have set all Mankind upon a Level.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>To deliver you from such appre|hensions,
I freely grant you that the Distin|ctions
of Quality ought to be kept up for
the Encouragement of Industry, and the sup|port
of Government. I hope now you have
the reason of my Concession, you will not be
so suspicious for the future.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="11" MS="y">
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not till you give me a farther
occasion; especially since the inference of your
discourse is not unacceptable: from whence
it followeth, that when a Man sees plainly
that he has the Advantage of his Neighbour,
he may let him understand so much without
any offence to humility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt of it, especially when
his station is publick; but then the discovery
of his superiority ought to be managed with
a great deal of Art and good nature, to which
we are obliged not only in point of Com|plaisance
but Justice. For though there is often
a real difference between one Man and an|other,
yet the party who has the advantgae
usually magnifies the inequality beyond all
Sense, and Proportion. Men don't consi|der
that the great priviledges of humane
Nature are common to the whole Kind; such
as being equally related to God and <HI>Adam,</HI>
Reason and Immortality, the same number of
Senses, and much of the same perfection and
continuance. And as for those things which
are the peculiar Advantages of a few; they
are either acquired and enjoyed by the strength
of those general ones I have mentioned, or
else they are forein and in a great measure
Chimerical, and therefore can be no real
enrichments of our nature. They are often
no more than the Blessings of Chance, of Flat|tery,
and Imagination. And though they
<PB N="17" REF="11">
may set us upon higher Ground, yet they
can add nothing to the true Stature of our
Being. But to combate this Vice more suc|cessfully,
we'll examine its most plausible
Pretences, and see if we can discover the
weakness of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What pretences are those?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean Learning, Nobility, and
Power; for these you know are accounted the
brightest and most distinguishing Advantages.
But though they ought all to be considered, yet
I believe there is much more Weight laid up|on
them, than in strict reason they will bear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk as if you were retain|ed
by the Mobile, and had a Mind to bring
us back to our original State of Ignorance
and Peasantry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you once again you are
much mistaken. I have no design to lessen
the value of any mans Honour, or Under|standing:
Let People have as much Sense
and Quality as they please, provided they
don't grow troublesom and ridiculous a|bout
it.</P>

<P>I somwhat suspect you have a
mind to engross this Vice of Pride to your
self. This sort of discourse looks like de|claiming
against Arbitrary Power, where the
sharpest Invectives are commonly made by
the most Enterprizing, and unmortifyed Men,
who are only angry that they are not pos|sessed
<PB N="18" REF="12" MS="y">
of that absoluteness themselves, which
they endeavour to render odious in others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah! you are somewhat smart.
However let me tell you, if I have any such
project as you imagine, you have me upon
a fair Dilemma. For, if my reasons against
Pride hold good, they will stand upon record
against my self, which I suppose will be no
unacceptable revenge for you: if they are in|significant,
you will have the diversion of
laughing at the folly of the attempt: and
which is more considerable, you may keep
your good opinion of yourself into the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray begin your attack as you think
fit, and for disputes sake I'll try how far I
can maintain the ground against you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>First then, Learning (to begin there)
and High Conceit agree very well together:
for a Man of Letters may have a clearer no|tion
of the stupidness and deformity of this
Vice, and being better acquainted with the
frame and passions of humane Nature, he
can't choose but discover how unacceptable
it must make him to all Mankind. Besides
he is supposed to know that nothing in strict
reason deserves a true Commendation, but a
right use of the Liberty of our Will, which is
in every ones power to manage to advantage.</P>
<P>Secondly, Learning gives us a fuller con|viction
of the imperfection of our nature, which
one would think might dispose us to Mode|sty.
<PB N="19" REF="12">
The more a Man knows the more he
discovers his ignorance. He can scarce look
upon any part of the Creation, but he finds
himself encompassed with doubts and diffi|culties.
There is scarce any thing so trifling
or seemingly common, but perplexes his Un|derstanding,
if he has but sense enough to
look into all the objections which may be rai|sed
about it. He knows he has a being 'tis
true, and so does a Peasant, but what this
thing is which he calls himself, is hard to
say. He has reason to believe, that he is
compounded of two very different Ingredients,
Spirit, and Matter; but how such unallyed
and disproportioned substances should hold a|ny
Correspondence and act upon each other, no
mans Learning yet could ever tell him. Nay
how the parts of Matter cohere, is a Question
which it's likely will never be well answer'd
in this life. For though we make use of the
fairest <HI>Hypotheses,</HI> yet if we pursue the Ar|gument
home, we shall go nigh to dispute
away our Bodies, and reason our selves all
in pieces. Insomuch that if we had nothing
but Principles to encourage us, we might
justly be afraid of going abroad, lest we
should be blown away like a heap of dust:
For it's no solution to say the greater parts
of Matter are connected with hooked parti|cles;
for still the difficulty returns how these
Hooks were made? <HI>Quis custodiet ipsos
<PB N="20" REF="13">
Custodes?</HI> What is it that fastens this Soder,
and links these first Principles of Bodies in|to
a Chain? And as the more refined Un|derstandings
know little or nothing of them|selves,
and of the material World; so upon
Enquiry we shall find them as defective in
their Skill about Moral Truths: (excepting
those who are taught by Revelation, which
supernatural Discoveries the unlearned are
capable of understanding, as far as their happi|ness
is concerned.) Those who made Laws in
their respective Countries, we have reason to
believe had their minds polished above the
vulgar rate: And yet we see how unaccount|ably
the publick Constitutions of Nations va|ry.
The <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Athenians</HI> allowed In|cest,
the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> Stealing, and some
<HI>Indians Herodotus</HI> mentions, used to bury
their best Friends in their Stomachs. In
short, the Rules of Decency, of Government,
of Justice it self, are so different in one place
from what they are in another, so party-co|loured
and contradictious, that one would
almost think the Species of men altered, ac|cording
to their Climates; and that they
had not the same Nature in common. One
would almost think that Right and Wrong
lay rather in the Fancies of men, than in
the reason of things, and was bounded more
by Seas and Rivers, than by any unalterable
limits of Nature; that Virtue and Vice were
<PB N="21" REF="13">
minted by the Civil Magistrate, and like
Coins would pass for Currant only in his
own Dominions. The Heathen Philosophers
may fairly be granted to have as good pretences
to Learning, as any other sort of men among
them: And yet we may observe from <HI>Tully</HI>
and <HI>Laertius</HI> what a small Proportion of solid
Knowledge they were Masters of; how
strangely did they differ in Matters of the
highest Import? How eagerly did they dis|pute,
and not without probability on both
sides: Whether there was any thing certain?
Whether the Criterions of Truth and Fals|hood
were clear and indubitable or not? Whe|ther
the Government of the World was ca|sual,
fatal, or providential? How many <HI>Sum|mum
Bonums</HI> have they presented us with,
some of them only fit to entertain a Brute,
others noble enough for a Spirit of the highest
Order? It were tedious to recount the differen|ces
one Sect had with another, their Incon|sistences
with themselves, and the ridiculous
and ill supported Tenets some of the most
famous of them have held. Insomuch that
<HI>Tully</HI> takes notice that there was no opinion
so absurd, but was held by some Philoso|pher
or other. 'Tis true they could wran|gle
and Harangue better than the common
People; they could talk more plausibly about
that they did not understand; but their Learn|ing
lay chiefly in Flourish, and Terms, and
<PB N="22" REF="14">
Cant; for as for any real Improvements in
Science they were not much wiser than the
less pretending Multitude. Indeed the more
modest of them would confess that the chief
use of Learning was to give us a fuller discovery
of our Ignorance, and to keep us from being
peremptory and dogmatical in our determina|tions.
Now one would imagine the more
intimate Acquaintance we had with the Im|perfections
of our Nature, the greater reason
we should have to be humble. Is Weakness
a proper Foundation to erect our lofty con|ceits
upon? Indeed he that has not the lei|sure
or capacity to examine how it's with
him, may be fondly persuaded to fancy him|self
somebody, and grow vain upon the kind
presumption; but for a man to be proud who
can demonstrate his own poverty, is little
less than Madness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the case stands thus, to make
all sure, we had best get an order to burn
the Twenty four Letters, and hang up <HI>Cad|m&uuml;s</HI>
in Effigie; for&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray don't interrupt me, and I will
try if I can give you a little Ease. Grant|ing
therefore, as we may, that Learning does
give some advantage, and that our Under|standings
are really enriched by it; yet in
regard we have but a few Principles to build
upon, the greatest part of our Knowledge
must consist in Inferences, which can't be
<PB N="23" REF="14" MS="y">
wrought out without great Labour and At|tention
of mind: And when we are at any
distance from self-evident Truths, the mind
is not only perplexed with the Considerati|on
of a great many Circumstances, but which
is worse, Forgetfulness or Mistake in the least
of them, frustrates our whole Design, and
rewards us with nothing but Error for our
trouble.</P>
<P>Now he that is so liable to be imposed
upon, who rises but by Inches, and enriches
himself, by such slow and insensible Degrees;
'tis a Sign that his Stock was either very
small, or that he is unskilfull in the ma|nagement
of his Business, and therefore he has
no reason to be proud of what he has got|ten:
Besides it's an humbling consideration
to reflect what pains we are obliged to take
to muster up our Forces, and to make that
little reason we have serviceable. How fast
does Obscurity, Flatness and Impertinency
flow in upon our Meditations? 'Tis a diffi|cult
Task to talk to the purpose, and to put
life and perspicuity into our Discourses; those
who are most ready and inventive have not
their best Thoughts uppermost: No, they
must think upon the Stretch, ransack, and
turn over their mind, and put their Imagi|nation
into a kind of Ferment, if they in|tend
to produce any thing extraordinary:
So that considering the Trouble and almost
<PB N="24" REF="15">
Violence we are put upon, one would think
that Sense and Reason was not made for
Mankind, and that we strive against our Na|tures,
when we pretend to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; What though our Minds
were poor, and unfurnished at first, is it a|ny
disparagement to us to have more Wit
than we were born with? What though we
can't strike out a Science at a Heat, but are
forced to polish our selves by degrees, and
to work hard for what we have? The less
we were assisted by Nature, the greater com|mendation
it is to our Industry, and our at|tainments
are so much the more our own.
And since we have thus fairly distinguished
our selves by Merit, why should we seem
unapprehensive of our Performances? since
we have paid so dear for the Improvements
of our understanding, and our advantages
are gained with so much Difficulty, what harm
is it to make our best of them? Why should
we not oblige the negligent to Distance and
Regard, and make those who are younger
or less knowing than our selves sensible of
their Inferiority?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you as I have alrea|dy
hinted, that a Man may lawfully main|tain
his Character and just pretences against
Rudeness and Ignorance, especially when the
publick Good is concerned in his Reputation.
But when he acts a private part, and conver|ses
<PB N="25" REF="15">
with People of Sense and Modesty, he
should give them but very gentle remem|brances
of his Prerogative: his Opinion of
his own worth should but just dawn upon
them, and at the most give them but an ob|scure
and remote notice, that he expected a|ny
singular Acknowledgment: He should
take the respect that is paid him rather as
a Present than a Debt, and seem thankful
for that which is his own: But to be stiff
and formally reserved as if the Company did
not deserve our Familiarity; to be haughty
and contemptuous, and to make scanty and
underproportioned returns of Civility: this
is a downright Challenge of Homage, and
plainly tells people, they must be very man|nerly:
'Tis in effect to say, Gentlemen, I have
more Learning, and have done the publick
greater Service than you, and therefore I ex|pect
to be considered for it: you may possibly
say that I have more preferment too, and
am paid for my merit in mony, but that
shall not serve your turn; for except you
shew your selves very dutiful, I shall give
you broad Signs of my dissatisfaction, and
never let you have the Honour of my con|verse
again. Now such a Man if he went
much abroad, would plague mankind more
with his Company, than he could oblige
them with his Writings, though they were
never so considerable. Such People seem to
<PB N="26" REF="16">
owe their parts to their ill Temper: Their
Industry is malicious, and they have taken
pains not so much to oblige the World, as
to get an Opportunity of trampling upon
their Inferiours. Had they been good-natu|red,
they would have been as dull and in|significant
as their Neighbours. But their
imperious Carriage is just as reasonable as it
would have been for the old <HI>Athletae</HI> to
have drudged hard in Eating and Exercise,
that they might employ their Bulk and Acti|vity
in beating every one who was weaker,
and less skilful than themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your discourse you seem to
mistake the matter, and not to weigh things
rightly. 'Tis not Superiority that these
Gentlemen of Learning are so solicitous a|bout;
'tis not personal Advantage which they
chiefly intend by their Reservedness: They
have no doubt a more publick and generous
Design; for you may observe they usually
bear hardest upon those of their own Order
and Profession, which is nothing but a for|ced
and politick stateliness for the promoting
of Knowledg in others. The young Fry,
whether you know it or not, must be held
at a Distance, and kept under the Discipline
of Contempt. If you give them any tolera|ble
Quarter, you indulge them in their Idle|ness,
and ruin them to all intents and pur|poses.
For who would be at the trouble of
<PB N="27" REF="16">
Learning, when he finds his Ignorance is
caressed, and that he is easie and acceptable
enough in the Company of the best Authors
of the Town? But when you brow-beat
them and maul them, you make them Men
for ever; for <HI>Vexatio dat intellectum;</HI> though
they have no natural Metal, yet if they are
spurred and kicked they will mend their pace,
if they have any feeling. Such rigorous usage
will make them study night and day to get
out of this ignominious Condition, in hopes
that it may come to their own turn to be
proud one day. Take my word for it, there
is no such way to make a Scholar, as to
keep him under while he is young, or un|preferred.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding your Flourish I
can't perswade my self that this Dispensation
of Pride is so mighty useful as you pretend.
I should think such an untoward manage|ment
of any Accomplishment should rather
discourage others from attempting such dan|gerous
circumstances. If Sense and Learning
are such unsociable imperious things, a good-natured
Man ought to take especial care not
to improve too fast. He ought to keep down
the growth of his Reason, and curb his In|tellectuals
when he finds them ready to out|strip
his Neighbours. I assure you, if I was
of your opinion, and thought my self near the
temptation to so much ill humour, I would
never look on a Book again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="28" REF="17">
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come when you have said all, there
is no keeping up the Credit of Learning
without that which you call a reserved be|haviour.
For if those who are eminent this
way should condescend to those Familiarities
which you seem to desire, the honour of
their Profession would suffer much by it; if
they should converse upon the Level, the
veneration which their Inferiours have for
them would quickly wear off: And if the
vulgar observed there was no distinction kept
up amongst the Men of Letters; they would
suspect there was nothing extraordinary in
any of them. Pray who are supposed to be
the best Judges of Learning, those who have
it or others?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt those who have it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then if they seem to undervalue it
themselves, is not this the way to bring it
into a general disrepute? I tell you once a|gain,
if the privileges of Merit are not insi|sted
upon all, must go to wrack. If a Man
who has digested all the Fathers, and is ready
to add himself to the Number, shews any
tolerable countenance to one who has scarce
rubbed through <HI>Ignatius,</HI> and lets a pure
English Divine to go cheek by jole with him,
the Commonwealth of Learning will grow al|most
as contemptible as that of the Pigmies,
and be only fit to write Romances upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="29" REF="17">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not enquire how far this
lofty method may advance the Reputation
of Learning, but I am pretty sure it's no great
addition to theirs who use it; for it only
makes others more inquisitive into their defects,
and more inclinable to expose them. If they
take them tardy they endeavour to humble
them by way of Reprizal. Those slips and
mismanagements are usually ridiculed and
aggravated, when such Persons are guilty of
them, which would be overlooked or excused
in others of a more modest and affable Con|versation.
If they happen to be found in|consistent
with themselves: If their vanity
of appearing singular puts them upon ad|vancing
Paradoxes, and proving them as Para|doxically.
If a presumption upon their own
strength, and a desire of greater triumph
makes them venture too far into the enemies
Quarters, and take up a Post which they
can't maintain; they are usually laught at
for their folly and left to shift for themselves;
for Pride never has any friends, and all Men
are glad of a just occasion to lessen his Re|putation
who makes such an ill-natured use
of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I conceive you harp a little too
much upon one string: do you think the in|feriour
Clergy for whom you are now plead|ing,
are discouraged by none but those of
their own Profession?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="30" REF="18">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I grant there is another sort
of People who use them with neglect enough:
But then they are somewhat more to be ex|cused.
They have not such fair opportunities
to understand the just pretences of a liberal
Education, and a Religious employment.
They are apt to fall under unfortunate hands
in their minority: The vanity of their Pa|rents,
and the Knavery of Flatterers often
gives them a wrong notion of themselves, and
makes them admire nothing but Wealt hand
Greatness, and think no condition deserves
regard but that which resembles their own. Be|sides
their neglect looks less unaccountably
by reason of their Quality, and their Breed|ing
makes their Pride sit more decently up|on
them. They usually contemn with a better
Grace than others: for there is a great deal
of Art and Mystery in Pride to manage it
handsomely: A man might almost as soon
learn a Trade: and if we observe we shall
find that those who were not brought up to
it, seldom prove their Crafts-master or practise
with any sort of address. To which I may
add, that such Persons are usually willing to
pay for their imperiousness, so that a Man
is not made a Fool for nothing. But when
this lofty humour is clumsily and inartifici|ally
managed, when it's affected by those of
a self-denying and mortified Profession, and
who get their Living by declaiming against
<PB N="31" REF="18">
it. When it's taken up by Men of Sense,
who may well be expected to see through
the folly of this Vice, and who generally
have not those pretences of a byassed Edu|cation
to misguide them: especially when
they play it upon Persons of their own Order
who were born and bred to as fair Expecta|tions
of Regard as themselves, and are some|times
their Inferiours in nothing so much as
in Success; this is such a singular Practice
that I had rather leave it undescribed than
be forced to give it its proper Character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you will be willing to
abate, if not to retract your censure when
you consider that these Gentlemen of the
Gown, whom you think too much depressed,
are many of them Curates; and is it not ve|ry
reasonable there should be a distance ob|served
between Masters and Servants? If you
confound these two Relations by lavish and
indiscreet Familiarities, you destroy the re|spect,
and by degrees the very notion of Su|periority.
If there is not a due Homage paid
in Conversation, those who are in a state of
subjection will neither know their Condition
nor their Duty: They will be apt to forget
they hold by a servile Tenure, and think
themselves enfranchised from all manner of
Suit and Service. Besides, if the Parson should
use his Curate with that freedom which you
insinuate, as if there was neither dependence
<PB N="32" REF="19">
nor obligation between them; this might be
of very ill example to the Parish, and make
all other servants challenge the same liberty,
and grow pert upon their Masters: And when
this Sawciness became universal, as it's likely
it might do in a short time, what less Mischief
could be expected from it, than an old <HI>Scythian</HI>
Rebellion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, I was not aware the be|ing
of Government depended so much upon
the distinction between Rector and Curate,
and that if the modern way of Distance and
Subordination was not kept up, we must
presently return to <HI>Hob</HI>'s state of Nature.
If a Curate be such a dangerous thing, that
a little civil Usage to him is ready to make
the World fall about our Ears, I wonder
why so many of them are suffered. Now
without raising the <HI>posse Comitatus,</HI> if the
Pluralists would but do their best to sup|press
them, their Number might quickly be
so retrenched, that they would not be in
the least formidable. But you seem to ar|gue
all this while upon a wrong Principle,
you take it for granted, that Curates are
Servants; now if this proves a mistake, you
will own they may be treated with a little
more freedom, without any danger to Au|thority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who doubts of their being Ser|vants?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="33" REF="19">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do, and for very good reasons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>See how a Man may be mistaken!
I thought the <HI>English</HI> of Curate had been an
Ecclesiastical Hireling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No such matter, the proper import
of the Word signifies one who has the Cure
of Souls; therefore in <HI>France</HI> all Parochial
Priests are called Curates, as they are like|wise
in our Rubrick and Common-Prayer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find then there lies no Servitude in
the Name, so that it must be either the De|putation,
or Salary which they receive from
the Instituted Priest, which sinks them into
this condition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>That there is no Servitude in either
of these, I am ready to make good. 1. Not

<P>Take your own method.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>What in your apprehension is a Cu|rate's
Employment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>To serve God in the publick Offi|ces
of Religion, and to take care of the
Parish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he is not entertained to serve
the Rector.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the next place I desire to know
whether Authority is not essential to a Ma|ster?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who questions it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="34" REF="20">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has the Curate his Authority to
Preach, and Administer the Sacraments from
the Rector?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, from the Bishop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>May not a Master turn away his
Servants when he pleases?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Rector has no power to re|move
the Curate after he is Licensed and
Fixed by the Bishop. To sum up the Evi|dence
therefore; if the Curate was not en|tertained
to wait upon the Rector, nor has
his Authority from him, nor can be removed
from his Employment, I think it is pretty
plain he is none of his Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but does not the Parson make
choice of him, and pay him?</P>

<P>How so?</P>

<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because they pay him Taxes, and
that among other reasons, by way of ac|knowledgment
of the benefits of his Govern|ment,
and that they may shew themselves
willing, if it was in their power, to requite
him for his care of the State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray why so much concerned to
prove Curates no Servants?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I am willing to rescue them
from that contempt, which they will certainly
fall into, as long as they pass under this no|tion:
which considering the number of persons
Officiating, this way, must be very prejudicial
to Religion. Besides it makes some persons,
who are fit to do the Church service, suspend
themselves, and shew their Priesthood only
by their Habit, rather than serve God under
such uncreditable circumstances: and for the
same reason others are tempted to grow too
fond of a Presentation, and choose rather to
court it by Flattery, or other indirect pra|ctices,
than be condemned to the servile con|dition
of a Curate. For let me tell you, it is
<PB N="36" REF="21">
no ordinary piece of Self-Denial, for a Man
of a generous Education, who has been train|ed
up all along to Freedom and good Usage,
to be degraded in his Manhood, when the
mind is most in love with Liberty, and to en|ter
upon Business with marks of disadvantage,
when he stands most in need of Reputation.
To my thinking this is a very discouraging
and preposterous way of Educating the Cler|gy.
If a Man must go to service, he had better
begin with it as they do in Trades, and not
be Master at first, and then be forced to turn
Apprentice, or Journyman afterwards. Of
such ill consequence it is to miscal things, and
as <HI>Plato</HI> observes, that an alteration of the
Notes in Musick is apt to produce an Innova|tion
in the Laws and Customs of a Country:
so by changing the names of Offices for
others of less Repute, we change the Uses and
Designs of them, and make them less satis|factory
to those engaged, and less serviceable to
the Publick than they would have been, if the
Character of their Institution had been kept up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Granting at present what you say
to be true, yet a Curate seems to lie under
another disadvantage, which makes him con|sidered
with Abatement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, People are apt to fancy that it
is the want either of Parts or Conduct, which
keeps him without a Patron.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="37" REF="21">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>If People think so, I am sorry their
Sense and Charity is no greater; for if they
examined things fairly, they would find that
the being a Curate is no Argument of a Mans
insignificancy, nor any just blemish to his Re|putation.
For it is often the integrity and ge|nerous
temper of his mind which hinders him
from a better Provision; it is because he will
not flatter the Pride of some, nor keep pace
with the Bigottry of others: because he will
neither court Greatness nor Faction, nor make
himself popular to the disadvantage of his
Audience. Because he cannot digest a Simo|niacal
Contract, nor charge through Perjury
with the courage of an Evidence. In short, it
is his plain and impartial dealing with the
People, his resolution to preserve the Decency
of his Character, and the Innocence of his
Conscience which bars his promotion: so
that if he was mean enough to complain, he
might have the satisfaction to apply this Sen|tence
of <HI>Tully</HI> to himself, <HI>Non nos vitia sed
virtutes afflixerunt.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a broad <HI>Innuendo</HI> is here up|on
the beneficed Clergy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you have given me an
opportunity of explaining my self. My mean|ing
is not that those who are possessed of Liv|ings
have gained them, by such indirect
Courses: God forbid! I only say, that all Men
are not so lucky as to have the offer of fair
<PB N="38" REF="22">
Conditions, and those who have not, must
be Curates if they will be honest; or else
lay by the use of their Priesthood, which I
am afraid is not very accountable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess you have brought your
self off well enough: But now I think on't
you must try to maintain the liberty of your
Curate a little more convincingly. For some
say there lies Prescription and immemorial
Custom against it, and then you know he is
a Servant by Common Law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all: For as we are lately
told by a great Lawyer, Prescription is good
for nothing where there are any Records to
the contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Records can you produce?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to mention no more, the <HI>18th</HI>
of the Apostles Canons, and the <HI>80th</HI> of the
Council of <HI>Eliberis,</HI> are, I think, considera|ble
Evidence; the first of which forbids the
ordaining of those who had married a Servant,
and the other excludes manumized Persons,
while their Patrons were living, from the
Priesthood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so? Then I fancy those
who drew up Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Injunctions
knew nothing of this piece of Antiquity you
mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Reason?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because by those Injunctions a Cler|gy-man
could not lawfully marry till he had
<PB N="39" REF="22">
gone and made his complaint against Celiba|cy,
before two Justices of the Peace, and
gained their consent, and the <HI>good will of the Ma|ster,
or Mistriss where the Damsel served.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then I suppose if he could not
prevail by his Rhetorick they gave him a
Warrant to distrein.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or possibly if he courted in <HI>forma
pauperis</HI> they assigned him a Wife <HI>gratis</HI> out of
an Hospital.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word this Order, take it
which way you will, has a singular aspect,
and looks as if it intended to put the Clergy
in mind, that they ought not to aspire above
an <HI>Abigail.</HI> Certainly Discretion and Merit
ran very low in the Church at that time, or
else, some People were willing to make the
Nation believe so. But to return to the Ca|nons,
the design of which was to secure the
Reputation of the Clergy; but according to
the modern opinion, this provision signifies
nothing; for if a man must go to Service af|ter
he is in Orders, had he not as good do it
before? In your sence he often only changes
his Lay for an Ecclesiastical Master, which
sometimes might be so far from an advantage
that it would make the Servitude the more
uneasie, by being subjected to one no more
than equal to himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you in the Primitive Times
the advantage of Priesthood was equally sha|red
<PB N="40" REF="23">
among all the Order, and none of that
Character had any Superiority over another.
For then the Revenues of the Church consist|ed
only in the voluntary Offerings of the Peo|ple,
which were all deposited with the Bishop,
who assigned every one his respective portion;
so that no Priest had any dependence upon
another for his maintenance; but now the
case is otherwise, and a man ought to be sub|ject
to him that supports him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's somewhat hard, that the bare
alteration of the Church Revenues should
make so wide a difference between those
who were equal before; that a man must
lose his freedom only for want of a Presen|tation,
and he made a Servant because he does
not take Tithes, though he has as much spi|ritual
Authority as if he did. But I perceive
you think there is no consideration equivalent
to a little money, and that he who receives
it must be no longer at his own disposal,
though he makes never so valuable a return.
Since therefore you insist so much upon main|tenance,
what if it appears that the Curate
maintains the Parson?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be strange indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what end were the Church Re|venues
intended?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>To keep up the worship of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="41" REF="23">
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>By settling a competent maintenance
upon the Ministers of Religion, that they
may be in the better capacity to discharge
their Office, and not be obliged to lose their
time, and lessen their Character, by engaging
in Labourious or Mechanical Employments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your arguing there should be
something for them to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they are to take care of that
Precinct to which their Endowment is an|nex'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you don't mean not to come
at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean they are to take care of the
performance of the duties of their Office.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then ought not he to have the
Revenues who performs these Duties?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not willing to grant that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care of denying the con|clusion;
you grant the Revenues of the
Church were designed for the support of the
Clergy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what Clergy? Those who live
many miles distant from the Premises?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I'm afraid they were intend|ed
for those who live upon the place, other|wise
methinks Endowments are a very slen|der
Provision for the benefit of the Parish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then if the Curate does all the
work, ought he not to have the reward for
<PB N="42" REF="24">
his pains? In short, either he is qualified to
undertake the Parish or not; if not, with
what sincerity can he be employed? If he is
qualified, why is he barred the profit when
he only performs the Conditions upon which
they were settled, when none but himself
answers the design they were intended for?
To speak properly, the Rector seems to live
out of the labours of another, he is main|tained
by the perquisites of the Curates Of|fice;
and therefore is in effect but a kind of
Pensioner to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you are an everlasting Level|ler,
you won't allow any encouragement to
extraordinary Industry and Merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake me. I would have the
best men have the best Livings, but then be|fore
we go to doubling of Preferments, possi|bly
it were not amiss to examine whether the
number of Benefices exceeds the Persons who
are capable of them. Let us first examine
whether they will hold out one apiece, and
when every man has one, then the supernu|merary
Livings may be divided amongst those
who are most deserving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>In good time, when it's likely there
there will be none left! Now do you imagine
the Church can be defended against her Ad|versaries
by the strength of a single Parso|nage?
But it may be you will say all our
Plurality-men are not Writers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="43" REF="24">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor Readers neither. Besides,
we may observe that Heresie and Schism were
very successfully combated before Unions,
Dispensations, and Consolidations were heard
of. If you consult Father <HI>Paul</HI>'s History of the
Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> (p. 216.) he will inform
you that Non-residence and Pluralities are
things of no very primitive establishment. I
confess some of the Lay-managers of our Re|formation
have not been over-kind to the
Church, so that Affairs are not in so good a
posture as they might have been: But God
be thanked there is still some provision left
for the Ornament and Defence of Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Provision do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to speak to your Case, there
are Dignities, to which those Gentlemen who
are prepared to engage in the Controversie
have a good right: And with submission to
better Judgments, I think it would not be
amiss if all dignified Persons held their Pre|ferments
by a new Tenure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Tenure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>By Knights Service; pursuant to
which they should be obliged to draw their
Pens in the Cause, when ever their Superi|ours
required them: to appear in the Field
upon an Invasion with their <HI>Quota,</HI> and in
short, to maintain any Post that shall be as|signed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="25">
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What if a man has not a mind to
quarrel, must he be turn'd out of his Digni|ty
for being of a peaceable Disposition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those peaceable men you speak of,
are none of the most useful in a time of War,
and therefore a smaller Gratification should
content them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What if they are disabled by age?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they should be continued for
their past Services.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly this is a good probable Ex|pedient
to keep the Church Militia in Disci|pline,
and might for ought I know, very
much improve the <HI>noble Science of Controversie.</HI>
But to return to the old Argument, if you in|tend
to bring me over to your opinion of the
Curate, you must clear the business of his Sa|lary
a little better, for I am afraid where he
has his money he ought to own he has his
Master too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess there would be a great
deal in what you say, if the Rector had the
right of Coinage. If the Money had his
Image, and Superscription upon it, the
Curate's taking it for currant, would con|clude
him under his Jurisdiction: but that
the bare receiving a sum should sink a Man
into a servile state, is past my comprehension.
For considering that Mony is a thing of such
quality, and sovereign sway in the World,
one would imagine it should bring Power
<PB N="45" REF="25">
and Reputation along with it, and rather
enlarge than abridge a Man's Liberty by re|ceiving
it. And to mention nothing farther,
the nature of the Contract between the Re|ctor
and Curate, is sufficient to give you satis|faction;
for there, as has been observed, the
Curate undertakes no other Employment but
the Instruction and Government of the
Parish. There is no attendance upon the
Parson, no running upon his Errands, nor
subjection to his Humour indented for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks it is a little hard a Curate
must not be called a Servant, as well as a
Cook, or a Footman, since he has Wages as
much as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Possibly not always so much nei|ther;
but waving that, if you had remembred
what I urged to you before, this Objection
would have been no difficulty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that the Curate is to wait
upon none but God Almighty, that the
manage of his Employment is not prescribed
by the Rector, but by the Rubrick and Con|stitutions
of the Church, and that he is not
removeable at pleasure. I suppose by this
time you apprehend there is a difference
between him and a Footman, or a Steward
either.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! Notwithstanding your sub|tlety,
this notion of Wages sticks in my Sto|mach
still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="46" REF="26">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder the glitter of a little Mony
should dazle your Eyes at that rate, that
you cannot see so plain a distinction. You
don't seem to understand Commerce, if you
think that something of Authority and Do|minion
is always given in exchange for Mony.
Now I am of <HI>Diogenes</HI> his mind, and believe
it possible for one to buy a Master, as well as
a Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, for the purpose, if a person of
twenty one puts himself Apprentice to ano|ther,
you know this is seldom done without
charge: now what does a Man do in this case
but purchase his subjection, and hire himself
a drubbing upon occasion? To give one in|stance
more. When a Woman of Fortune mar|ries
a Man with nothing, does she not give
him Meat, Drink, and Wages to govern her?
And to end this dispute, you know Physicians,
and Lawyers, and Judges, have Fees or
Wages, either given, or assigned them by
Law, without being thought Servants to
those they are concerned with. Now, what
reason is there a Curate should have worse
luck with his Mony than other People?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>To deal plainly, I suppose it is be|cause
he does not get enough of it. If his
Fees were as considerable as any of those
Gentlemen you speak of, I question not but
his Office would be much more reputable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="47" REF="26">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well guessed, and therefore what
Character do they deserve who confine him
to this scandalous Pittance. I believe you
can scarcely name any sort of Injustice which
has a more malignant influence upon Religi|on
than this oppresion of Curates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so Tragical?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because their Poverty exposes them
to Contempt, which renders their Instructi|ons
insignificant, and which is worse, makes
them less considerable in themselves, as well
as in the opinion of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope Poverty is no crime.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but it's a scurvy temptation,
especially to those who have lived freely, and
been bred to better Expectations. For when
a man finds his hopes disappointed, himself
unsupported, and topp'd upon by Persons of
meaner Pretences and Employments; this
is apt to pall his Spirits, and check the cou|rage
of his thoughts, so that his Compositi|ons
and Fortune will seem to be much of a
piece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought strait circumstances had
been none of the worst promoters of Learn|ing,
according to the old saying, <HI>Ingenii lar|gitor
Venter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant there is some truth in your
observation, and that it is Want which often
reconciles men to Labour and Letters; but
this is at their first setting out, when though
<PB N="48" REF="27">
they have not gained their point, yet they
are full of hopes, which pricks them on,
and puts them upon their utmost. but after
they are once qualified for success, and find
their industry discouraged, this makes them
sink in the socket, and fret away their
strength and Spirits; so that either out of
impotence, or disgust, or dispair, they give
over the fruitless pursuit, and seldom make
any generous attempt ever after. 'Tis true,
there are some hardy souls that won't be
beaten off by ill usage, but these are very
rarely to be met with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you think there would be
a strange improvement in the unbeneficed
Clergy, if they had a better Salary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I think they would have
more Books, and more Learning, and more
Credit. They would not be so easily obli|ged
to improper Compliances, nor so liable
to several other miscarriages in their Conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your discourse the slender pro|vision
which is made for them, should be
very Criminal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless so it is. For pray con|sider.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray be as brief as you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say then, for a Clergy-man to en|rich
himself by the labour and necessities of
one of his own Order, and make his Figure
out of the Church without performing the Ser|vices
<PB N="49" REF="27">
required, is a direct translating the holy
Revenues to a Foreign and secular use, and
consequently besides other aggravations is
no better than sacrilege, which is a very un|canonical
Sin, and unless we are very much
in the dark will be accounted for afterwards.
In short this Practice has been the main ground
of the Contempt of the Clergy, making one
part of them grow cheap by their Poverty,
and the other by their Covetousness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what allowance would you
oblige the Rector to, if you had the Regula|tion
of that Affair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>To speak within Compass, in my
Opinion the Curate ought to have half the
profits, let the value of them be never so
considerable; for if the Parson has the other
moiety for doing nothing, I think he has no
reason to complain. But if the Living be
small, then he that supplies it should have
two thirds assigned him, because he cannot
be decently supported under that proportion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am not disposed to examin
that matter any farther. But I beseech you
what is all this to the business of Pride? I
think your Zeal for the Curates has tran|sported
you a little out of your Subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No such matter; for it is generally
nothing but Ambition which makes Men
Covetous and Mean: besides, if it is a Di|gression
it is a very seasonable one. However
<PB N="50" REF="28">
I am willing to take my leave of this part of
the Argument, therefore if you please we will
call a new Cause.</P>
</SP>

<P>I think it is best to adjourn at pre|sent,

<P>So am I, and there|fore
if you please without any further Cere|mony,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, and since (as
has been shewed) Learning and Conceit,
make so odd a Figure; let us proceed to exa|mine
the pretences of Nobility, for I am a|fraid
the Vulgar Notion of it is screwed some|what
too high, and that it has not, Ballast
enough to carry all the Sail which is com|monly
made out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must tell you, you are upon a
touchy Point, and therefore I hope you will
treat so nice a subject as this is with proporti|onable
caution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="52" REF="29">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sensible of what you say, and
shall manage my enquiry with all the fairness,
and decency, the free discussion of the Que|stion
will allow. To begin, you know all
Men were equally Noble, or if you will,
equally Plebeian at first: now I would glad|ly
understand how they came to be so much
distinguished afterwards, for there are diffe|rent
reasons assigned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose the distinctions you men|tion,
were founded upon extraordinary per|formances,
and won at the expence of Indu|stry
and Merit. For how can you imagine
any persons should emerge out of the com|mon
Mass of Mankind, unless by the advan|tages
of Capacity, Labour, and Resolution?
Their mounting, argues that Fire was the
ruling Element in their Composition; and
that they were of a more vigorous and en|terprizing
Spirit than their Neighbours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am willing to suppose with you,
that they made a generous use of these ad|vantages,
and employed them for the bene|fit
of Mankind: being as remarkable for their
Justice, Fidelity, and good Humour, as for
their Conduct and Courage; and therefore I
am not willing to believe the account which
some pretend to give concerning the Original
of Nobility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="53" REF="29">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will tell you that it has been of|ten
founded upon Rapine and Injustice. It seems
they have observed out of <HI>Thucidides,</HI> that in
antient times it was counted an Heroick At|cheivement
to Plunder lustily, and he was a
Man of the best Quality, who was able to
steal most Cattle. These <HI>Nimrods</HI> (say they)
grew great by the strength of their Limbs
and their Vices, engraved their Murthers
upon their Shields, and Hectored all the little
and peaceable People into Peasantry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>This looks so like a Chimerical and
ill natur'd Opinion, that I shall not do it the
honor of a Confutation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no exceptions to your Re|sentment,
but to go on, for the more distinct
consideration of the Argument, we will di|vide
Nobility into two kinds, Hereditary, or
Acquired. The first is transmitted to us from
our Ancestors, the other is immediately con|ferred
by the favour of the Prince.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proceed upon the several parts of
your Division.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>1. Then, Hereditary Nobility seems
no just ground for a high Opinion, because it
is borrowed. Those great Actions which we
had no share in, cannot properly be any part
of our Commendation, especially if we want
abilities to imitate them. 'Tis true, they
ought to be taken notice of by others for the
encouragement of Vertue, and the ornament
<PB N="54" REF="30">
of Society. But then he that depends wholly
upon the worth of others, ought to consider
that he has but the honor of an Image, and
is worshiped not for his own sake, but upon
the account of what he represents. To be
plain, it is a sign a Man is very poor when he
has nothing of his own to appear in; but is
forced to patch up his Figure with the Re|licks
of the Dead, and rifle Tomb-Stones and
Monuments for Reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding your rallying, I
cannot conceive what crime it is to possess the
Inheritance of our Forefathers. Now Honor
is part of their Estate, which was raised on
purpose that we might be the better for it.
And since their Children were the occasion of
their merit, and pushed them on to generous
undertakings, ought they not to share in the
glory of the Success?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. But it should be managed with
great modesty, because though an honourable
Title may be conveyed to Posterity, yet the
ennobling Qualities which are the Soul of
Greatness, are a sort of incommunicable per|fections,
and cannot be transferred. Indeed
if a Man could bequeath his Virtues by Will,
and settle his Sense, and Learning, and Reso|lution,
upon his Children, as certainly as he
can his Lands, a brave Ancestor would be a
mighty privilege.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="55" REF="30">
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope those fine Qualities are not
so incommunicable as you suppose, for me|thinks
there is a <HI>Ie ne scay quoi,</HI> in persons
well born: there is a peculiar Nobleness of
Temper in them, their Conversation is inimi|tably
graceful, and a Man may distinguish
their Quality by the Air of their Faces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish that Spirit of Honor and
Bravery you mention, was inseparable to their
Quality; but it is too plain that great Minds,
and great Fortunes don't always go together;
however I grant there is some Truth in your
observation, but am afraid the distinction
does not always spring from the cause you
assign. For by the gracefulness of Conversa|tion,
I suppose you mean a decent Assurance,
and an Address in the Modes, and Gestures
of Salutation. Now these are pretty accom|plishments
I confess, and recommend a Man
to Company with some advantage; but then
they are easily gained by Custom and Educa|tion,
and therefore we need not fetch them
<HI>ex Traduce.</HI> And moreover, these little For|malities
are often magnified beyond all Sense
and Reason, and some People are so Fantasti|cally
fond of them, as if they were the top|per
perfections of Human Nature; and that it
were in reality a more valuable and gentile
quality to Dress well, and come handsomely
into a Room, than to take a Town, or to be
fit to discharge the Office of a Privy Coun|sellor.

Now with submission to these Cere|monious
Gentlemen, I am not of their mind
in this matter, but think it much better for a
Mans Parts to lie in his Head, than in his
Heels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so too, but you have not
answered the whole.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>True! Your Air was omitted: now
if this was a constant privilege of Birth,
which you know it is not, yet in this deceit|ful
Age of ours, there is no Arguing from
an Outside. Besides, I doubt this Advantage
is sometimes the effect of a slothful and Ef|feminate
Life. When Men will attempt no|thing
either in the Field, or in their Closets:
when they will neither trouble themselves
with Thinking, nor endure to be exposed to
the Weather: This Niceness, though it ren|ders
them insignificant to the great purposes of
Life, yet it Polishes their Complexion, and
makes their Spirits seem more moving and
transparent. Sometime this Sprightliness and
Grandeur of Face, is Painted by Flattery:
for when Men are once made to believe they
are very Considerable, they are presently for
trying to write the Inscriptions of their Quality
upon their Forehead. Now Conceit when
it is Corrected with a mixture of Gravity,
is an admirable <HI>Wash,</HI> and will make one
look as Wise, and as Great as you would
wish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="57" REF="32">
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Grandeur of Face, as you call
it, may possibly be explained upon kinder
Principles; for I am apt to believe that a
quick Sense of Honour, a Consciousness
of Worth, an Elevation of Thought, will
sometimes break out into a Lustre, and
make the great Soul sparkle in a Man's Eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny what you say,
and therefore the best Construction ought to
be made, where the known Character of the
person does not disallow it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot,</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you can be fair when you list,
therefore I shall venture to go on with you to
another Advantage of Nobility, <HI>viz.</HI> Anti|quity.
Now to begin in your own way,
Don't you think it is a great addition to ones
Birth to stand at the bottom of long Parch|ment
Pedigree, and be some yards removed
from the first Escocheon? Is not that Family
substantially Built which can stand the shock
of Time, and hold out against all varieties of
Accidents? How generous must that Blood be,
which has been so long Refining, and run
through the Channels of Honor for so many
Ages, where it is sometimes as hard to come
to the Plebeian Fountain: as to find out the
Head of <HI>Nilus?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so hard neither, For if you go
but one Inch farther than the Gentleman at
the Top you spoke of, it is ten to one but you
take old Goodman, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by the Leathern
<PB N="58" REF="33">
Breeches. And as for the Antiquity of a
Family, though it looks prettily at first sight,
yet I fear it will abate upon examination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray try your skill upon it, for I
am not of your mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then to deal plainly with you, I
conceive the Antiquity you talk of, is com|monly
nothing but antient Wealth, and there|fore
the chief commendation of this Privilege
consists in the long continued Frugality of the
Family, who after they were once possessed
of an Estate, had the Discretion to keep it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it nothing then for a Man's An|cestors
to have lived in Reputation, and to
have had Interest and Command in their
Country for so many Generations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose the <HI>English</HI> of all this is
no more than that they have lived in good
Houses, Eat and Drank better, and born
higher Offices than those who have wanted a
Fortune. Now Mony, and a moderate share
of Sense, will furnish any Man with all these
Advantages. And as to the holding out a|gainst
so many Accidents, and Alterations of
State, I am afraid it sometimes proceeds from
shifting and indifferent Principles, and from a
servile compliance with whatever is Upper|most.
So that what my Lord <HI>Bacon</HI> menti|ons
in reference to Notions and Inventions,
may be sometimes applicable to Families;
where he tells us, that Time is like a River,
<PB N="59" REF="33">
in which Metals and solid Substances are
sunk, while Chaff and Straws swim upon
the Surface.</P>
<P>Secondly, You are to consider that an an|tient
Gentility does not necessarily convey to
us any advantage either of Body or Mind:
and to speak like Philosophers, these are the
only two things in which we are capable of
any real improvement. I confess, if every
Generation grew Wiser, Stronger, Hand|somer,
or longer Lived than the other: if the
Breed of a Man's Family was thus improved,
the farther it was continued; then indeed the
quality of an Escocheon would be exactly
contrary to that of Cloaths, and the one
would always grow better, as the other does
worse, by wearing. From whence it would
follow, that if the seven Sleepers had been
made Gentlemen immediately before they
entred their Cave, and had held on their Nap
from seventy, to seven hundred years, they
had most undeniably slept themselves into
a considerable degree of Quality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may talk as subtilly as you
please, but you must not think to baffle esta|blished
and uncontested Opinions, with a few
Logical quirks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray don't grow warm, and I will
endeavour to satisfie you, and in order to it,
I observe in the third place, That an antient
Gentility, makes a Man Superior only to those
<PB N="60" REF="34">
of the same Quality, (<HI>viz.</HI> an Esquire, to an
Esquire, and so in the rest) and that in nothing
but in point of Precedency. The reason, I
suppose, why those which are placed in any
degree of Honor, precede others who are af|terwards
raised to the same Height, is for the
encouragement of Industry. To make Men
forward to exert their earliest Endeavours to
deserve well of the State; for this reason there
is a distinction made between Merit, other|wise
equal, only upon the account of the Pri|ority
of Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<L>Is this all you can afford?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you! We that pretend to be
subject to a Constitution, must not Carve out
our own Quality, for at this rate a Cobler
may make himself a Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<L>And what then?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then I say, it is Vanity for
any Man to have a better Opinion of his Fa|mily
than the Law allows: my Reason is,
because the Law is the measure of Honor, as
well as of all other Civil Rights. Besides, I
must tell you that it is both reasonable, and
the Interest of the State that Merit should be
considered, of what date soever it is. A
worthy Action ought to be as much reward|ed
now, as one of the same kind was a
thousand years since. The prospect of Ho|nor,
to a generous Mind, is the chief incite|ment
to all great Undertakings. This consi|deration
<PB N="61" REF="34">
Polishes Arts and Sciences, makes
Men Industrious in improving their Under|standings,
and Resolute in exposing their
Persons, for the Publick Service. If there|fore
we dote upon Antiquity so far, as to un|dervalue
the Merit of the present Age, the
Government must necessarily suffer by it: for
such a Partiality will slacken the Nerves of
Industry, and occasion a negligence both in
those who have an antient Title to Honor,
and in those who have not. The first will
grow sluggish, because they have a sufficient
share of Reputation already; and therefore
need not run any hazards about getting
more. The latter will abate in their forward|ness
to oblige their Country, because they
know their Service, though never so great,
will be contemned, and for that very Reason
which ought to make them the more valued,
that is, because their Considerableness came
from themselves. Moreover, If the Inheri|tors
of antient Honor, have not by Personal
Additions improved that Stock which was
granted to their Ancestors; there is no reason
it should be rated above the same Degree
(Precedency excepted) which is given now.
For to affirm that a Family raised to Nobility
by this King, is not as good as one raised by
the Conqueror, is a reflection upon his pre|sent
Majesty: it supposes his Judgment, or
his Authority, less considerable than that of
<PB N="62" REF="35">
his Predecessours; and that the Fountain of
Honour is almost dry'd up, and runs more
muddy than in former Ages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot,</SPEAKER>
<P>How plausibly soever you may
make your opinion look, I'm sure it has the
disadvantage of being Singular. For you
know a plain Gentleman of an ancient Fa|mily
is accounted a Person of better Quality
than a new made Knight, though the reason
of his dubbing was never so Meritorious.
Honour like <HI>China</HI> Dishes must lie some
Ages under Ground before it comes to any Per|fection.
And to carry on your own Figure,
the greater distance from the spring always
makes the Stream the more considerable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>This it is to be wiser than the Laws!
And since you are for Illustrations I reply,
that to suppose an ancient Title (though
lesser in degree) is preferable to a greater
of late Creation, is as if one should affirm
that an old shilling is better than a new
half-Crown, though the Alloy and Impression
are the same in both. Nay from your Ar|gument
a man may conclude that a coarser
metal only by being digg'd and refin'd in
the Dayes of our Great Grandfathers, (though
perhaps it has contracted some rust by lying)
is more valuable than the same weight in
Gold but lately separated from the Oare.
And that an ancient Estate is really better
than one newly purchased, though the Lands
<PB N="63" REF="35">
of the latter are richer, and the Survey lar|ger
than the other. Now if a man should
prove so fanciful as to demand a greater
Rent for his Farm because it has been in the
Possession of his Family for some hundred
of years, I believe the want of Tenants would
soon convince him of his Errour. From
whence it's evident that in taking an Esti|mate
of Nobility we are not so much to
consider its Antiquity, as the Merit of the
first Grantee, and the distinction the Prince
has put upon it; which like Figures or o|ther
marks upon Money, stamp the value,
and tell the Subject for how much it is to pass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray by your favour are not Med|dals,
and Coyns valued more for their An|tiquity
than their Metal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Question is to the point;
and therefore I answer,</P>
<P>First, That Coyns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> though they are
valuable as rarities, yet they signifie little
in Exchange and common use; And if a man
has any debt to pay, or Commodities to
buy, K. <HI>Charles</HI> his Image, and superscripti|on
will do him much more service than
Ce'sar's.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Reason why these things
are sometimes so much valued, is not because
they are old but useful: They often rectifie
Chronology, and explain History, and re|trieve
us several material parts of Learning,
<PB N="64" REF="36">
which might otherwise have been irrecover|ably
lost.</P>
<P>Thirdly, There is a disparity in the case
of ancient Coyns and Families; For in the
first you have the same numerical peice, in
the latter nothing but the Name or Relation,
so that the change and succession of Persons
seems to destroy the notion of Antiquity.
To make the Instance parallel we must sup|pose
a Gentleman as old as <HI>Methusalem,</HI> and
then I confess he would be a great Curio|sity,
and ought to be valued accordingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I remember you were saying,
the merit of the first Gentleman of the House
ought to be consider'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I conceive that circumstance
very material, and that if upon enquiry it
proves unintelligible, or unlucky, it's no small
abatement to the Family. For if he Advan|ced
himself by a voluntary engaging in unjust
Quarrels, he has no better pretence to Hon|our
than what a resolute and successful Pad|der
may Challenge. If he owes his Heraldry
to a servile Flattery, and a dextrous Applica|tion
to the vices of Princes, the marks of
their Favour are rather infamous than Hon|ourable
to his Posterity, because he is en|nobled
for those qualities, for which he ought
to have been punished.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What if the Gentility was pur|chased,
I hope we may make the best of what
we have paid for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="65" REF="36">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means! But then this is a
sign that Worth and distinguishing Quali|ties
were wanting, otherwise the Honour
had been conferred Gratis. The same may
be said when <HI>Arms</HI> or Titles are given at
the Instance or recommendation of a Favorite,
for this is down-right begging for Quality,
and looks more like an Alms than an Ho|nour.
Farther it's a lessening to a mans No|bility,
when the Reason and Grounds of it
are unknown, for if his Rise had been de|rived
from worthy and creditable Causes, he
would in all likelyhood have been as certain|ly
acquainted with them, as with his Arms;
It being both easie and for the Reputation
of the Family, that Records of this nature
should have been preserv'd, and therefore the
loss of them seems rather to proceed from
Design than Neglect. In short, if the first
Principles of Honour happen to be thus coarse,
or counterfeit, it's not in the power of time
to mend them: A Pebble or <HI>Bristol</HI> stone
will not change their natures, and improve
into Diamonds, though they are laid up a
thousand years together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark you Mr. I doubt your Effects
(if you have any) have lain but a little
while in the Heralds Office.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Probably as long as your Wor|ships:
But I take it to be much more a Gen|tlemanly
quality to discover such unsociable
<PB N="66" REF="37">
mistakes than to abett them. If we are ca|pable
of understanding any thing, it must
undoubtedly be more creditable to promote
good humour and modesty in Conversation,
and give men right Apprehensions of them|selves;
than to flatter them into groundless
Conceits, and make them believe they may
be truly Great, and yet good for nothing.
To maintain such indefensible and dangerous
Principles of Honour, which not only impose
upon our Understandings, but emasculate our
Spirits, and spoyl our Temper, and tend
only to the nourishing of Idleness and Pride;
is in my opinion no very Heroical under|taking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I find we must come to the
Merits of the Cause as you call them, and
examine upon what foundation the Family
stands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think that is the only way to
know what we have to trust to, and how
far we may insist upon the advantages of
Birth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are the usual steps to Ho|nour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose one of these three, Learn|ing,
Commerce or Arms. The pretences of
Learning have been examined already; To
which I shall only add, that if a Person whose
mind is enlarged, and beautified with all
sorts of useful Knowledge, is notwithstanding
<PB N="67" REF="37">
obliged to Modesty, and Sobriety of thought,
then certainly those who claim under him,
and are wise only by Proxy, ought not to
grow too big upon their Relation to the
Muses. To Proceed, Commerce is another
Expedient which often distinguishes a man
from the vulgar. For Trading raises an Estate,
and that procures Honour, so that in this Case
Wealth is the main of the merit, and that
which is chiefly insisted on by those who
inherit it. But here we ought to be very
cautious and meek-spirited, till we are as|sured
of the honesty of our Ancestours, for
<HI>Covetousness</HI> and <HI>Circumvention</HI> make no good
Motto for a Coat. And yet your men of
Trade are too often assisted in their Fortunes
by these Qualities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you are too hard upon them,
and believe they may come into their Estates
by more accountable methods, <HI>viz.</HI> by their
Industry, by Understanding how to make use
of all fair advantages, and by the luck of
a good Acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant there is a great deal of
Good Faith, Frankness and Generosity to
be found among Tradesmen, and that such
Professions are necessary to the convenience
and splendor of Life, and being thus useful
ought to be esteemed Honourable. But their
being used to value small gains is apt (with|out
care) to make them contract a narrow|ness
<PB N="68" REF="38">
of Spirit, and to stand too much to
the point of Interest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that which they call the
Mystery of Trade?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>A great part of it consists in the
skill of over-reaching their Customers, which
Science, I fear is not learned meerly for Spe|culation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Possibly it may be for Caution,
that they may not be imposed on by others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am willing to think so, however
these <HI>Arcana Officinae,</HI> are counted such Essen|tials,
that except an Apprentice is fully in|structed
how to Adulterate, and Varnish, and
give you the Go-by upon occasion, his Ma|ster
may be charged with Neglect, and sued
for not teaching him his Art, and his Trade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems then he cannot be an Honest
Man, except he teaches his Servant to play
the Knave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Granting your Inference, yet you
know a Man may understand his Weapon bet|ter
than his Neighbour, and notwithstanding
be of a very peaceable inoffensive Temper.
However, when the Rise of the Family is
owing to such an Original, a Man has a par|ticular
Reason not to flourish too much upon
the glitter of his Fortune, for fear there should
be too much Alloy in it. For some People
are forced to climb in a very mean and servile
posture. They must Flatter, Deceive, and
<PB N="69" REF="38">
Pinch; use their Neighbours, and themselves
too, very unkindly, before they can gain
their Point. So that if the Ancestour had not
been remarkably Little, his Posterity had
never been reputed Great.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what needs all this Scruple?
Why should I enquire so anxiously how my
Ancestors came by their Estate? Let their
Merit be as small as you please, the Revenue
will not sink upon this Score. Now, if you
considered the Sovereignty of Mony, how it
commands Honor, and Beauty, and Power,
how much of Ornament, and Defence, and
Pleasure there is in it; you would allow us to
be a little Uppish upon the Matter: for when
a Man has such a Universal Instrument of
Delight, and is Master of that, which is Ma|ster
of every thing else, he ought visibly to
Congratulate his Happiness, and pay himself
a particular Respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I could purchase a parcel of new
Senses, and some pretty undiscovered Curiosi|ties
to please them with, I confess I should
be more desirous of growing Rich than I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What though you cannot buy any
new, you may please the old ones better, and
make one Sense go as far as two, with Po|verty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not altogether of your mind;
besides if my Understanding does not im|prove
proportionably, I am only in the fairer
way to be more a Brute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="70" REF="39">
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Understanding! Mony will buy
good Books, and though the Owner should
should not know how to use them, yet if
has an Estate, he will never want People
to make him believe he has Sense, which
will be in a manner as well, for Pleasure con|sists
mostly in Fancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't envy such a one the enter|tainment
of his Imagination, though I believe
it is much short of the transports of Lunacy:
but withal I think that folly and madness are
no proper Judges to pronounce upon the Ad|vancements
of human Nature. But to re|turn
to the Argument, no person can be Great
by being Owner of those things which wise
Men have always counted it a piece of great|ness
to despise. To which I must add, that
it is not the possessing, but the right manage|ment
of any valuable Advantage which
makes us Considerable. He that does not
employ his Fortune generously, is not to be
respected merely because he has it. Indeed if
a Man gives me part of his Estate, I am
bound to make him an acknowledgment;
but I am not obliged to honor him because he
is pleased to keep it to himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! Since Merchandize is some|times
liable to exceptions, and antient Wealth
has no right to challenge Worship, and
Homage. Pray what do you think of Nobi|lity
raised by Arms? I hope here you will
<PB N="71" REF="39">
grant the Materials are all shining, and solid.
And when an Ancestour works out his For|tune
by great and hazardous Undertakings,
by contempt of Danger and Death, and all
the instances of an Heroick Gallantry;
is it not highly reasonable his Descendants
should share his Honor, as well as his Inhe|ritance?
Nay, they seem obliged, in justice
to his Memory, to have some stroaks of Great|ness
and Reserve in their Carriage. They
might better be Profuse in their Expences,
than their Familiarities. The wasting his
Estate, and razing him out of the Heralds
Books, is scarce more injurious to his Name,
than the heedless Condescensions of his Fa|mily.
For by such ill managed Humility,
they do as it were Prostitute his Quality,
mingle his Ashes with ignoble Dust, and de|face
the Monuments and Distinctions of his
Merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess a Man ought to be civil
to his Generation, but not to that degree as to
plague the Living, only in Ceremony to the
Dead. And I may say farther, that a Noble
Ancestor, does not desire his Posterity should
pretend to honor him this way, except his
Qualities, as well as his Name descend upon
them. A person truly Great, is never fond
and unreasonable; he hates to see Folly Ido|lized,
though it be in his own Children;
and had rather have his Memory buried in
<PB N="72" REF="40">
Oblivion, than his Honor should be Usurped
by a Degenerate insignificant Off-spring. Be|sides,
the reasons you assign why Martial
Men ought to be valued by after-Ages, seem
to be common to other pretences to Nobility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry if they appear so, since
I designed them chiefly for the advantage of
Arms. For in my judgment, the Profession
of a Soldier has a particular, and paramount
Title to Honor. For can there be a more ex|traordinary
instance of Greatness, than for a
Man to be undismayed amidst so many horri|ble
Instruments and Images of Death? To
expose his person as freely as if he knew him|self
immortal, and to fear nothing but Obscu|rity
and Disgrace? And therefore though
there are many other creditable Employments
and Accomplishments, yet there is a tran|scendent,
and almost an astonishing Great|ness
and Gracefulness in Valour. It has some|thing
more illustrious and sparkling, more
Noble and Majestick than the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold! You are going to describe
<HI>Alexander</HI> or <HI>Cesar;</HI> do you think that every
<HI>Field,</HI> or <HI>Charge</HI> in <HI>Gules,</HI> can pretend to all these
fine things? This must be examined farther by
and by: at present I shall only observe to you,
that though I have a great esteem for a Gentle|man
of the Sword, and don't in the least intend
to lessen the just Character of Military Glo|ry;
yet I conceive there is another Pro|fession,
<PB N="73" REF="40">
which possibly does not glitter alto|gether
so much upon the Sense, but for all
that, if you touch it 'twill prove right Sterling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<L>What Profession do you mean?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>That of Learning; therefore if you
please, I will just glance upon the Advantages
of Learning without interposing my judg|ment
by way of comparison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do so, for I think you had need
say some kind things upon this Argument, to
make amends for the freedom you took
with it in our former Conference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't mistake me, I am conscious
of no Injury, and therefore design nothing by
way of Reparation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<L>Take your Course.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>1. Then not to mention that Learn|ing
is an improvement of our Minds, which
is the noblest part of us. I say not to menti|on
this, you may please to take notice, that
without some share in this accomplishment,
War it self cannot be successfully managed.
Without the assistance of Letters, a Man
can never be qualified for any considerable
Post in the Camp. For Courage and Cor|poral
Force, unless joyned with Conduct,
and reach of Thought (which are the usual
effects of Contemplation) is no more fit to
command than a Tempest; doing for the most
part more harm than good, and destroying
it self by its blind and ill directed motion.
<PB N="74" REF="41">
It is Learning which teaches a General the
successes and events of Action in former Ages,
which makes him better able to judge of
his present preparation. It instructs him how
to take advantage of his Enemies, and avoid
those miscarriages which have been fatal to
others before him. It teaches him how to
Fortifie and Assault, how to manage the diffe|rence
of Ground and Weather. It lets him
into the knowledge of Human Nature, and
shews him how to understand the Tempers of
other men, and to govern his own. It dis|covers
by what secret Springs the Passions are
moved, what are the most probable Causes
of Hope and Fear, of Resolution and Cowar|dise;
and how strangely they are mixed, and
varied according to the difference of Cli|mates,
Governments, Conditions, and Oc|cupations,
especially according to the different
Age, Temper, Interest, and Experience of
those who are in Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, no doubt it teaches a Man to
take a Soul in pieces, as easily as a Watch!
If ever I heard such Conjuring!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray be not so sharp, the Discourse
is not so Romantick as you suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<L>Go on.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Secondly, I observe that the Ad|vantages
of Learning are more lasting and
extensive than those of Arms. The Courage
of a Soldier, does his Country not much
<PB N="75" REF="41">
service after his death, the benefit of it being
usually confined to one Age: whereas by the
knowledge of Men and Things, Publick Pro|visions
for Society are framed, and the Con|stitution
adjusted to the Temper, and Conve|nience
of the People; of the happy effects of
which, remote Posterity is often sensible.
And as the Consequences of Valour, seldom
reach beyond the death of him who shewed
it, so there are few the better for it, except
those a Man engages for; which are com|monly
none but his Countrymen. But
Learning, by inventing and improving Arts
and Sciences, scatters its Favours in a much
larger compass; becomes a universal Benefa|ctor,
and obliges mankind in its most com|prehensive
Latitude of Place and Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will grant that Learning
must fly to the Protection of the Sword to
secure its quiet, and all the profits accrewing
from thence. For in earnest, Notions, and
Syllogisms, are very defenceless things against
Violence. If we had nothing but Philosophy,
Statutes and Reports, to secure the Peace;
our <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum</HI> were but in an ill con|dition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you, and shall just add
in the third place, That the successes of Learn|ing
are naturally of a very innocent Tendency,
and under good management prejudicial to
none. The Conquests of Arts are not like
<PB N="76" REF="42">
those of Arms, gained by slaughter, and at|tended
with ruin and desolation. No, Here
is nothing routed but Ignorance and Error,
nothing destroyed but obstinate Humour, and
savage Disposition:
<Q>Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros.</Q>
But a Martial Man, except he has been
sweetned, and polished by a Lettered Edu|cation,
is apt to have a tincture of sowerness,
and incomplyance in his Behaviour. And
therefore if you observe your old Heroes in
<HI>Homer,</HI> (for want of being Book-Learned)
were none of the Gentilest Men. What a
rugged tempestuous, unconversable Mortal
was <HI>Achilles;</HI> I could never fancy that same
<GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! I perceive it is requisite for
a Man to get some Sense to his Courage if
he can: but have we not lost all our Pride,
and gone somewhat off from the Point?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, We have only fetched a Com|pass,
and thrown our reasoning more into a
Circle to invest the Place; and now we will
come on directly, and make a little Assault,
only to try the strength of the Garrison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very Soldier-like! In plain <HI>English</HI>
I doubt you are attempting to shew that it is
not so much the Profession of Arms, as the
unexceptionable management of that Profes|sion
which makes a Family honourable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="77" REF="42">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. Therefore before we fall too
much in love with the Buff in the Wardrobe;
we should examin whether the War was just,
whether our Ancestor fought in defence of
his Prince and Country, or let himself out to
any person who would hire him to mur|ther.
We should consider whether the En|terprize
was Great and Dangerous; whether
the Advantages were gained by open Bravery
and Resolution, or were no more than the
effects of Chance, of Treachery, or Surprize.
And though a Man can give a creditable An|swer
to all these Questions, he should then re|member
there are a great many persons who
have ventured as far as himself, and yet con|tinue
in their first Obscurity: so that had it
not been his good Fortune to have fallen un|der
the Notice of his General, his Merit had
been unrewarded. There are many persons
who perform signal service in a Breach, or
Scalado, and yet their Courage is often un|regarded,
and lost in the Crowd, and Tu|mult
of the Action, so that they get nothing
but Blows for their Pains. To wind up this
part of the Discourse: let the Rise of the Fa|mily
be never so considerable (I mean none
but Subjects) it ought not to supersede the
Industry, or stop the Progress of those who
are thence Descended. For if we rely wholly
upon the Merit of others, and are Great only
by imputation, we shall be esteemed by none
<PB N="78" REF="43">
but the injudicious part of the World. To
speak out, if neither the advantages of For|tune
and Education (which often concur in
these Cases) the expectation of others, nor
the Memory of worthy Ancestors, if none
of these Motives can prevail with a Man to
furnish himself with Supravulgar and Noble
Qualities, this is an argument that he is
either under a natural incapacity, or else
has abandoned himself to Sloth, and Luxury.
And without dispute he is most emphatically
mean, who is so under the greatest advan|tages
and arguments to the contrary. So
that the Lustre of his Family serves only
to set off his own Degeneracy, it does <HI>Facem
proeferre pudendis</HI> and makes him the more
remarkably Contemptible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are smart upon the empty
Sparks! And I perceive by your discourse
that if we intend to set up strong, we must
do something for our selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: And therefore I presume that
Women have more reason to insist upon
their Birth than Men: because they have not
so fair a trial to discover their worth. They
are by custom made incapable of those em|ployments
by which Honour is usually gain'd.
They are shut out from the Pulpit and Barr,
from Embassies, and State Negotiations, so
that notwithstanding (as I believe it often
happens) their Inclinations are generous, and
<PB N="79" REF="43">
their Abilities great, to serve the publick;
yet they have not an opportunity of shew|ing
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I think you need not have
been so liberal to the <HI>Beau-Sex;</HI> you know
they have enough to be proud of besides
Heraldry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<L>What do you mean?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<L>Their Beauty Man.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, I believe that may disturb
them sometimes; but they have no great
reason for it. For Beauty though it's a pret|ty
varnish, yet it's of a frail Constitution,
liable to abundance of Accidents, and but
a short lived Blessing at the best. And waving
this Consideration, it seems to be made chief|ly
for the entertainment of the lookers on.
Those who are so much admired by others,
can't share the pleasure of the Company
without the help of a Glass; for the Eyes
which shew us other Objects cannot see them|selves.
Nature seems to have laid the most
graceful parts of our Fabrick out of our
way; to prevent our vanity. For could
some People always command a sight of
their Faces, they would <HI>Narcissus</HI> like be
perpetually poring upon their Handsomeness,
and so be neither fit for Business, nor Com|pany.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>To my thinking you have not
cleared the Point; For why may we not
<PB N="80" REF="44">
insist upon the privileges of Nature? Why
should a fine Woman be so prodigal of her
Beauty, make strip and waste of her Com|plexion,
and squander away her Face for no|thing?
There is no reason persons of a less
agreeable aspect (except they have some o|ther
advantage) should converse with beauty
upon a Level. For those who cannot fur|nish
out an equal proportion towards the plea|sure
of Conversation, ought to pay for their
insufficiency in Acknowledgments. Beauty
without doubt was design'd for some ad|vantage,
and if so, certainly the Owners
have the best right to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it; and therefore it's allowa|ble
for them to set a value upon their Persons,
for the better disposal of them. And farther
if they have a mind to it, they may please
themselves, because they are acceptable to
others, which is a generous satisfaction:
But when they grow humoursom they spoil
all; For Pride not only raises a prejudice
against their Beauty, but really lessens it.
For if you observe, it paints an ill-natured
Air upon their Face; and fills them with
spleen and peevishness and passion, which
exhausts their Spirits, and makes their blood
less florid, so that their Beauty is neither so
agreeable nor lasting as otherwise it would
be. And if the present inconvenience will
not cure them, they will do well to remem|ber
<PB N="81" REF="44">
that they must of necessity grow humble
when they are old; unless they are so fan|ciful
as to doat upon Rubbish and Ruins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray let us take leave of the Ladies,
and proceed to the other branch of your
Division, <HI>viz.</HI> to acquired Nobility. And
here methinks every thing looks unexcepti|onable
and fine upon your own Principles.
For here we are beholden to none but our
selves; we are not thrown up the Hill by
anothers Arms, and made considerable by
Diversion, or Chancemedly; but climb the
ascent by plain Strength, and indesatigable
Activity. Is it not a singular commendation
to have our circumstances not only large
and Honourable, but Independent; and al|most
to create the privileges we enjoy? Here
is no gilding of a coarse substance, no bor|rowed
Glory, no faint Reflection from an
Ancestour, but the Man is all bright and
luminous to the Center, and shines and
sparkles in his own worth. He is not Great
by Genealogy and ancient Title, by the
Favour of Fortune and the Labours of those
he never help'd, but by Nature and Per|formances,
by having Greatness incorporated
in himself. Now may not a Person who
has thus distinguished himself by his Merit,
make use of the Honour which has been so
justly confer'd upon him, and put the Lazy
and less significant in mind of their Defects?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="82" REF="45">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you recollect your self you will
find that this point concerning Acquired
Nobility has been occasionally discoursed alrea|dy:
Therefore I shall only add that upon sup|position
a Man has obliged the Publick, and
is remarkable for great Abilities and a gene|rous
Use of them; he would do well to remem|ber
that there are others who have ventured
as far, and performed as considerably as him|self,
whose Services all miscarried as to any
private Advantage, because they were not so
lucky as to act under the Notice of those who
were able to reward: And that many Persons
well furnish'd for Employment and Honour,
go out of the World as obscurely as they came
in; only for want of a proper opportunity to
bring them into Light, and publick View.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What tho some People are unlucky,
ought their misfortunes to be pleaded to the
prejudice of Desert in others?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. But when a man has received
so valuable a consideration for his Service
as Honour and Estate, he ought to acquiesce,
and not press too arbitrarily for Submission.
He should not set a tax upon his Conversation,
and put the Company under Contribution for
Respect. Besides a Gentleman of the first <HI>Head</HI>
has a particular reason to manage his Advance|ment
obligingly: For by treating the little
People roughly, he does in effect but expose
his Ancestours and reproach his own former
Condition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="83" REF="45">
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have so many fetches with
you! But what do you think of Magistrates?
In my opinion those who represent their
Prince, and are the Ministers of Justice, can|not
practise that Humility and Condescension
you seem to admire, with any manner of
Decency, or Security to the publick. For if
they don't oblige their Inferiours to Distance,
their Reputation will sink, and the Majesty
of the Government will be lessen'd, and then
it's easie to guess what the consequence must
be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you: Magistrates
ought to assert their Office, and not make them|selves
cheap by improper Familiarities. But
their Character may be over-strained. To
prevent which inconvenience they may please
to remember that their power was given
them upon a publick account, more for the
benefit of others than themselves. They are
deputed by their Prince, for the countenan|cing
of Virtue, for the ease and Protection of
the People, and therefore they should discou|rage
none who are regular and fair, they
should shew their Authority upon nothing
but Insolence and Injustice, Thieves and Male|factors;
upon those who affront the Govern|ment,
or break the Peace. There is no
necessity they should bring the Air of the
Bench into common Conversation, and wear
their Commissions always upon their Faces.
<PB N="84" REF="46">
To manage their Power thus singularly looks
like a little private Design of setting up for
themselves; as if they procured their Au|thority
to fright the Kings Liege Subjects,
and to over-awe the Neighbourhood into a
greater Reverence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if they should happen to take
too much upon them, are the People to slight
them upon this account?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means: the Authority ought
to be consider'd let the Men be what they
will. However in general I observe that the
best way to secure Observance, is not to
insist too violently upon it. For Pride is a
most unfortunate Vice, other Immoralities
usually gain their Point, though they lose
more another way; but a Proud man is so
far from making himself Great by his haugh|ty
and contemptuous Port, that he is usually
punished with Neglect for it: and that
Disdain with which he treats others, is
returned more justly upon himself: which
may be done without much difficulty, in
regard Honor is not become a property so
far as to have all it's Appurtenances bounded
and fix'd by Law. The Circumstantials and
oftentimes the most pompous part of Ce|remony,
are arbitrary and undetermined.
For we are not told either by Statute, or
Common Law how many Bows a Su|periour
of such a degree may expect from
<PB N="85" REF="46">
us, nor how low we are to make them, nor
how often the terms of Respect are to be used
in our Application.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean that it is not settled by Act
of Parliament, how many Sirs and Madams,
a Discourse of such a length is to be sprinkled
with; and therefore a cross-grained Fellow,
will tell you he has his Betters upon their Good
Behaviour: if he likes their humour, he will
be as liberal to them in acknowledgments as
they please; if not, he shall take the freedom
to hold his hand, and let them help them|selves
how they can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! I cannot reconcile this self-denying
Humour you are contending for to
the Character of a Gentleman. Such an un|toward
management of Fortune and Honour
as this is, argues either that a Man wants
Sense to understand his Condition, or Spirit to
maintain it. To throw away the Prerogatives
of our Birth, or the rewards of our Industry,
at such a careless Cynical rate, is a sign of a
Rustick inapprehensive meanness, and that we
have not the least inclination to Greatness in
us. For those who desire to be Great, will
endeavour to excel, and those who excel will
be sure to shew it; for the Essence of Great|ness
lies in Comparison. A tall Man loses the
advantage of his Stature, unless he stands
streight, and overlooks his Neighbour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="86" REF="47">
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks you are somewhat out
in your notion of Greatness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us hear if you can hit it better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>To speak freely, I conceive it a
much more substantial and better natured
thing than you have made it. Greatness cer|tainly
does not consist in Pageantry and Show,
in Pomp and Retinue; and though a person of
Quality will make use of these things to a|void
Singularity, and to put the Vulgar in mind
of their obedience to Authority, yet he does
not think himself really the bigger for them:
for he knows that those who have neither
Honesty nor Understanding, have oftentimes
all this fine Furniture about them. Farther,
To be Great, is not to be starched, and for|mal,
and supercilious, to swagger at our Foot|men,
and browbeat our Inferiours. Such a
Behaviour looks as if a Man was conscious of
his own insignificancy, and that he had nothing
but Outside, and Noise, and ill Humour, to
make himself Considerable with. But he
that is truly Noble, has far different Senti|ments,
and turns his Figure quite another
way. He hates to abridge the Liberties,
to depress the Spirits, or any ways to
impair the satisfaction of his Neighbour. His
Greatness is easie, obliging, and agreeable,
so that none have any just cause to wish it
less. And though he has a general kindness
for all Men, though he despises not the mean|est
<PB N="87" REF="47">
Mortal, but desires to stand fair in the
Opinion of the World, yet he never courts
any Man's Favour at the Expence of Justice,
nor strikes in with a Popular Mistake. No,
He is sensible it is the part of true Magnani|mity
to adhere unalterably to a wise Choice:
not to be over-run by Noise and Numbers,
but to appear in defence of injured Right, of
neglected Truth, notwithstanding all the
Censure and Disadvantage they may some|times
lie under. To conclude his Character,
A Great Man is affable in his Converse, gene|rous
in his Temper, and immoveable in what
he has maturely resolved upon. And as
Prosperity does not make him haughty and
imperious, so neither does Adversity sink
him into meanness and dejection: for if ever
he shews more spirit than ordinary, it is when
he is ill used, and the World frowns upon
him. In short, he is equally removed from
the extremes of Servility and Pride; and
scorns either to trample upon a Worm, or
sneak to an Emperor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>In earnest, you have described a
Person of Honor: And I am so far pleased
with the Character, that I would give all I
am Master of to make it my own. But can
we receive no other Advantages from Nobility,
but what have been hinted already?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that I can think of at present,
are these following.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="48">
First, It gives a fair occasion to excite the
generosity of our Minds, and disposes us to
the imitation of great Examples, that so we
may not seem unworthy our Predecessours.
Indeed, a Man is bound in justice not to im|pair
the Reputation, not spoil the Breed of
the Family: but to hand down the Line to his
Posterity, at least with the same good Condi|tions
he received it.</P>
<P>Secondly, These Privileges of Birth may
serve to check an insolent Humour in others,
who behave themselves contemptuously to|wards
us upon lesser, or but equal pretences.</P>
<P>Thirdly, A Man may make some Ad|vantage
this way, when he falls undeservedly
under Publick Disgrace, or is unrighteously
Oppressed. For in such a Case, the mention
of his Ancestours seems free from all suspicion
of Vanity, and may fairly be interpreted to
proceed either from self-Defence, or greatness
of Spirit.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The same may be done when
any Office or Promotion, may Legally be
claimed by vertue of an honourable Condi|tion.
For example, If a Man should put in
to be one of the Knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> he might
modestly enough publish his Pedigree, and
prove his six Descents, against a less qualified
Competitor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are at a stop, I think I can
carry your concessions somewhat farther. For,
<PB N="89" REF="48">
as I remember, it has been granted already,
that the common People may pay a Respect
to Quality, though you mortifie the Pleasure
a little severely in those who receive it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>May pay a Respect, call you it? I
say they must. For not to mention that
Gentlemen have generally a greater share of
Fortune and Sense too, than those of vulgar
Condition; not to mention this I say, if they
had nothing to plead but their Quality, they
ought to be regarded upon that Score, because
the State sets a value upon it, and that for
publick and considerable Reasons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive if a Man will but stay
and hear you out, you are civil enough at the
last. Pray what are we to do next?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, now I could run a Discourse
with you upon the inconveniences of Pride:
and snew you in particular, what an uncon|querable
Aversion it gives all Mankind against
us, when we are overgrown with it. How it
multiplies, and conceals our Defects from us,
and makes us do a thousand silly things, with|out
taking notice of them. How it makes
us a Prey to Flatterers, and puts us to great
Expences only to be laughed at. I might de|bate
with you, how it spoils Conversation,
and takes away the pleasure of Society. How
often Families, Kingdoms, and Churches are
embroiled, and the World turned topsiturvy
by this Vice. These and many other ill con|sequences
<PB N="90" REF="49">
of Pride might be enlarged upon;
but this part of the Argument is, I conceive,
more proper for Divines, and therefore I shall
pursue it no farther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well moved! For now I think it is
almost time to give over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Philal.</SPEAKER>
