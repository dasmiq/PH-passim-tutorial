<HI>satisfie</HI> the <HI>Readers curiosity,</HI>

not the <HI>Creation</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI>
and <HI>Earth</HI> most wonderfull and glorious? For
when there was nothing but <HI>rudis indigestaque

forme, then <HI>God</HI> made the <HI>Sun, Moon,</HI> and <HI>Stars</HI>
also, and set them in the <HI>Firmament</HI> to give <HI>light</HI>
upon the <HI>Earth,</HI> and this natural Light the <HI>World</HI>
enjoyed in the beginning: but afterward out of
the <HI>Chaos</HI> of blind <HI>Ignorance, God</HI> to the
<HI>Worlds</HI> greater amazement <HI>created</HI> and <HI>ordai|ned</HI>
the <HI>Firmament</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> and placed there|in
the <HI>Sun</HI> of <HI>Righteousnesse</HI> our <HI>Saviour Jesus
Christ</HI> then clouded under <HI>Types</HI> and <HI>Figures,</HI>
and also the <HI>Moon</HI> which was the <HI>Primitive

<PB REF="3">
like <HI>Stars</HI> of severall <HI>magnitudes;</HI> but all gli|stering

the <HI>Church,</HI> and in the <HI>time</HI> of the <HI>hottest perse|cutions:</HI>

who did <HI>fight</HI> his <HI>battails,</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> his <HI>cause:</HI>
even reproving <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> for his sake:
These were called <HI>Fathers</HI> of <HI>honour,</HI> and there|fore
let us <HI>honour</HI> them, because they <HI>honoured
God;</HI> and though we cannot imitate them so neere
in their <HI>lives;</HI> as wee ought, yet let us strive to
imitate them as neere as we can in our <HI>minds,</HI> and
let us follow thousands of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> through tem|porall
<HI>death,</HI> to eternall <HI>life:</HI> and with <HI>Nazian|zen</HI>
give our selves wholly to the performances of
all <HI>Christian duties:</HI> For these <HI>Primitive Fathers</HI>

and bid <HI>large profers</HI> for <HI>Heaven,</HI> come

<HEAD>PHILO IVDAEVS.</HEAD>
</FIGURE></HEAD>
<P>_THis <HI>Philo</HI> was a <HI>Iew</HI> of <HI>Alex|andria,</HI>
of the stocke of the
priests, and hee is deservedly
placed among the Ecclesiasti|call
Writers, because that in
his workes hee sets forth
the prayses of the Christians.
He was sent Embassador by the <HI>Iews</HI> his Coun|trimen
to <HI>Rome,</HI> to plead for his whole Nation,
and to qualifie <HI>Caius</HI> the Emperours anger, who
was possessed against the <HI>Iews</HI> for divers crimes
and enormities which they had committed;
hoping by his endevour and wisdome to set
them right againe in the Emperours good opi|nion:
<PB N="2" REF="6">
so testifies <HI>Photius,</HI> and Saint <HI>Ierome,</HI> and
<HI>Suidas,</HI> and <HI>Eusebius:</HI> hee flourished in the fifti|eth
yeere after Christs Incarnation, in the
Reigne of <HI>Nero</HI> the Emperour, the occasion
that he was sent to <HI>Rome</HI> was thus, whereas be|tweene
the <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Graecians,</HI> inhabiting <HI>Alex|andria,</HI>
there fell a great sedition, three choice
men of either side was set apart to plead their
matters and grievances before <HI>Caius. Appian</HI>
then being the chief for the <HI>Graecians,</HI> objected
many and enormous crimes against the <HI>Iews</HI> a|mongst
others that they would not, neither did
give that due honour and obedience to the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
Emperour, which they ought: for whereas
through all the <HI>Roman</HI> Provinces, there were
Temples and Altars built to <HI>Caius,</HI> that hee as
well as other Gods might be worshipped: these
<HI>Iews</HI> onely of all others denied to performe any
such respect; neither would they sweare by the
Name of <HI>Caesar:</HI> Hereupon this <HI>Philo</HI> the bro|ther
of <HI>Alexander Alabarchus,</HI> being an excellent
and wise philosopher, and an excellent man for
all <HI>sorts of Learning, and knew well how to
guide his passion, that nothing could move
him to wroth; in despight of</HI> Appion, and all
those that strove to exasperate <HI>Caius</HI> against
him and the <HI>Iews,</HI> fitted himselfe to cleere his
Nation of those foule aspersions: but <HI>Caesar</HI>
would not heare him, but commanded him (in
a great fury) to depart his presence: whereupon
<HI>Philo</HI> turning himselfe to his Countrimen that
came along with him from their Nation, as
<PB N="3" REF="6">
Associates, spake thus to them, <HI>Now let us be of
good courage, and undaunted hearts, for though
the Emperour be against us; yet God that rules
him, is for us.</HI> This <HI>Iosephus</HI> testifies of him in
his eighth Booke and tenth Chapter of his <HI>An|tiquities</HI>
of the <HI>Iews.</HI> And thus saith a learned
man of him:</P>
<P>That the noble and couragious heart hath
still this property, to be alwayes doing things
honest and vertuous; not onely for his own par|ticular,
but for his Countries good, though it
be with losse of credit, or exile, and with the
frowne of princes; for true <HI>worth</HI> indeed de|pendeth
of <HI>Vertue;</HI> and all other things are of
<HI>Fortune.</HI> For that man, that is truly magnani|mous,
and of a great spirit, (as was this <HI>Philo)</HI>
doth continually carry himselfe upright under
any burden, be it never so weighty: and nothing
doth happen amisse or displeasing unto him, be
it never so difficult and hard to be borne: for a
Wise man knoweth his owne forces, and with
his vertue he vanquisheth all sudden accidents.</P>
<P>This <HI>Philo</HI> was eloquent of speech, rich in
sentences, deep and profound in the explication
of the sacred Scriptures: hee was excellent as|well
in the <HI>Pythagorean, Platonicke,</HI> as in the
<HI>philosophy</HI> of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> insomuch that he was
counted one that excell'd others. So also was
he renowmed for his skill in the <HI>Greeke,</HI> that he
was held the chiefe of his time. Hence the pro|verbe
came: <HI>Aut Plato Philonizat, aut
Philo Platonizat:</HI> Either <HI>Plato</HI> imitates <HI>Philo,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="7">
or <HI>Philo Plato,</HI> because of their congruity in
writing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> in <HI>Claudius</HI> Reigne did so ad|mire
his Works, that they esteemed them wor|thy
to be kept safe in a publike Library, as Mo|numents
of his famous Learning, hee was ad|mirable
for his threefold explanation of <HI>Scrip|ture,</HI>
by the <HI>Literall, Morall,</HI> and <HI>Allegoricall</HI>
sence, so that most of the Ancient Doctours of
the Church have imitated him, and have cald
him the <HI>Inventor,</HI> as <HI>Sixtus Senensis</HI> doth re|late
<HI>Possevi.</HI></P>
<P>As hee was also famous for his Learning, so
for his parentage being of great descent, and
executed Offices of the chiefest esteeme with
credit and fidelity: and it is reported of all, that
<HI>Caius</HI> the Emperour, because in the <HI>Iewish</HI> Tem|ples,
hee was not worshipped by these Titles,
JOVI ILLUSTRI NOVO CAIO, and
being incensed by <HI>Appion</HI> against the <HI>Iewes,</HI> but
specially against this <HI>Philo,</HI> that hee intended to
have slain him; but failing in that, hee did with
extreme violence persecute and afflict the <HI>Iewes</HI>
every where; but chiefly those that lived in <HI>A|lexandria:</HI>
This <HI>Philo,</HI> notwithstanding, being
of an admirable courage and vivacitie, did pub|likely
deny that ever such prophanenesse and
grosse Idolatry should be practised among the
Servants of God, especially themselves who had
fled thither for the Truth.</P>
<P>And that you may fully see what a rare In|strument
this <HI>Philo</HI> was for al sorts of Learning,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
either <HI>Philosophicall</HI> or <HI>Theologicall:</HI> Let his
Mysticall Expositions of <HI>Moses</HI> Writings ex|presse
it. Hee did throughly, saith one, Search
the Entrails and Bowels of them: by which
leaving the literall sence, hee directed men to a
higher end, <GAP DESC="foreign">, even
to gaine <HI>eternall life,</HI> and the <HI>perfection</HI> of all
<HI>Vertue.</HI> Nay, saith <HI>Iosephus: Philo</HI> was so ex|cellent
in his studies for copiousnesse of <HI>Inven|tion,</HI>
for <HI>gravity</HI> of <HI>Expressions,</HI> for giving
<HI>light</HI> to dark words, that all the <HI>Ancients</HI> gave
him credit for <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Learning,</HI> so that many
did follow his foot-steps: as <HI>Clemens, Gregory,
Nazianzen:</HI> and among the <HI>Latine</HI> Fathers,
Saint <HI>Ambrose,</HI> who confesseth, that he exchan|ged,
nay, borrowed many excellent things of
<HI>Philo.</HI> There are some Fathers that have bla|med
him a little for his too too inquisitive
braine, and doe conclude that <HI>Hee</HI> and <HI>Origen</HI>
were in some things fabulous and ridiculous,
but all wise men know, that the greatest <HI>Lights</HI>
of the Church have had some blemishes. <HI>Ber|nardus
non videt omnia.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, as a Wiseman saith, Let no man
upbraid another man with his misery; for weak|nesse
and infirmities is common to all mortall
men; and no man knows how soone hee may be
over-taken and have his failings; for it is an in|jury
to laugh at anothers infirmities: when
the best of men are incident to the like im|perfections.</P>
<P>But this <HI>Philo</HI> was also well skild in <HI>Histories,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
wherein hee showes not onely a rare commen|dation
of <HI>Vertues,</HI> but declares himselfe a sharp
hater of <HI>Vices:</HI> so that even they which spake
against him for some of his <HI>Allegories,</HI> give
him a joint praise for his <HI>Historicall</HI> parts and
<HI>knowledege;</HI> the time and place wherein hee li|ved
was full of Learning; hee did live in the
Reignes of <HI>Tiberius, Caius</HI> and <HI>Claudius:</HI> And
so having done so much, hee departed this hu|mane
life, about the 50 yeere after Christ. His
usuall saying was, <HI>That there is nothing better for
a man then to be borne, nor anything better for
him than to die soone and quickly; For Death is
the medicine of all evils incident to man.</HI></P>

<P>_HE was of no mean parentage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruffi. c 9. Niceph. c. 18. lib. 2. Euseb l. 3. c. 9.</NOTE> or De|scent;
but of an ancient stock of the
<HI>Priests:</HI> and of that Line which
was the chiefe of the foure and
twenty, and by his Mothers side was of the
Bloud Royall, shee being of the Family of the
<HI>Asamonaeans,</HI> who a long time not onely held
the Priesthood of that Nation, but the King|dome,
his great Grand-father was called <HI>Symon
Psellus,</HI> at what time <HI>Hircanus</HI> the sonne of <HI>Sy|mon</HI>
the <HI>High-priest,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioseph. p. 989.</NOTE> the first of that name held
the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> hee was borne the first yeare of
<HI>Caius Caesar,</HI> and had three sonnes, <HI>Hircanus</HI> the
eldest, <HI>Iustus</HI> and <HI>Agrippa:</HI> in <HI>Vespasians</HI> Time
<PB N="9" REF="9">
this Genealogie and Succession was truly kept
in publike Tables: as his parents were great and
Noble, so their Integrity and uprightnesse was
well knowne to all <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> hee was bred up
from his Childhood in good Discipline, and
had an excellent memory, and quick understan|ding:
so that the <HI>High-priest</HI> and <HI>Elders</HI> of the
City much regarded him: hee passed through
all the three Sects of <HI>Pharisees, Sadduces,</HI> and
<HI>Essenes:</HI> and did most approve the life of the
<HI>Pharisees,</HI> and did in his strictnesse of life imitate
one <HI>Banus,</HI> who liv'd solitarily by fruites and
herbes: At two and twenty yeares, he professed
himselfe a <HI>Pharisie,</HI> which is much like to the
<HI>Stoicks</HI> amongst the <HI>Graecians,</HI> and presently
tooke a Voyage to <HI>Rome,</HI> to plead the cause of
some honest and good men, who for little or
no cause were bound and carried before the
<HI>Emperour.</HI> In his Voyage the Ship was cast
away, yet he with others, by Gods blessing, with
swimming, saved their lives, and did appeare
at <HI>Rome,</HI> and got speciall familiarity with <HI>Ali|turus</HI>
a <HI>Iew,</HI> who was in great esteeme with the
Emperour; by whose helpe hee got to be made
knowne to <HI>Poppaea,</HI> the Wife of the Emperour,
and so freed those <HI>Priests</HI> from their bonds, and
further dangers, and was rewarded by her with
great gifts, and so returned home againe.</P>
<P>Hee was in his outward behaviour and man|ners
courteous and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> of humanity: And in
his speeches aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ble and friendly to all, making
himselfe pleasing and agreeable to most men, as
<PB N="10" REF="10">
much as in him lay: and acquainted himselfe
only with such as were good and vertuous; for
in so doing he shunned the hatred of one, and
was sure to get the favour of the other: For
Wisemen accustome themselves gladly and wil|lingly
to indure things with patience, to the in|tent,
they may the better do it, when they shall
be forced to sufferance.</P>
<P>He was in his time a famous Warriour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In vita Ios. 1029.</NOTE> and
performed great Exploits, hee was taken priso|ner
alive at the siege of <HI>Iotopata,</HI> and was kept
with great care and command, by a company of
Souldiers.</P>
<P>In the time of his imprisonment, which was
but short, being about five dayes, hee did write
many things concerning the government of
man in affliction: And as a Wise man saith,
which is not impertinent; That afflictions on
earth are as so many good guides and Compa|nions
unto the godly, which, though of them|selves
unworthy, yet make their cause the bet|ter,
who aime at a higher end then the blinded
eyes of the ignorant can behold: and become
the Masters of their own hopes: before others
perceive them in trouble: For saith hee, The
<HI>Heavens</HI> are their only prospect, where they be|hold
the <HI>Creatour</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> in his height of
<HI>Wonder;</HI> and <HI>themselves</HI> are the <HI>Mine</HI> into
which they <HI>dive,</HI> to finde <HI>reason triumphant,</HI>
by which they discerne their insurrective passi|ons
and afflictions.</P>
<P>And as another saith, That it is good for a
<PB N="11" REF="10">
man to live in the greatest assurance that hee can
possibly: howbeit, if hee be constrained to ha|zard
and adventure himselfe, it is more fit that
he contend and strive with it honestly, then to
shun and flie from it shamefully: considering
that all men are destinated to die: but Nature
hath only ordained and framed them that are
vertuous and wise, to die valiantly and couragi|ously;
and to beare afflictions patiently.</P>
<P><HI>Vespasianus</HI> did much honour and respect him
for his Learning and Knowledge, and at his
command hee married a certaine Captive Vir|gin
of <HI>Caesarea,</HI> but lived not long with her, for
she went with the troops to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and he
himselfe married another, and so with <HI>Titus</HI> was
sent to <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> where he was in great danger
of the <HI>Iews;</HI> for they esteemed him no better
then a Traitour and a Betrayer of their Nation:
but <HI>Titus</HI> slighted these clamours of the Vulgar:
but the City being taken, <HI>Titus</HI> gave him leave
to chuse something that might be beneficial for
him: but hee not desiring to be made rich with
the spoils of his Countrey, desired nothing but
the freedome of his body, and his Writings;
both which the Emperour did grant unto him.
Hee preferred study and knowledge before ho|nour
and riches; for he knew that the one soone
fadeth, and the other abideth for ever: For hee
held amongst all <HI>goods</HI> and <HI>pleasure</HI> of this life,
only <HI>wisdome</HI> was <HI>immortall:</HI> And we common|ly
see, that those to whom Riches most befall,
doe find sooner the end of their living, then of
<PB N="12" REF="11">
their longing: Which consideration, hath caused
most wise men to vent these or the like speeches
concerning the infelicity of coveting Riches
before Knowledge: How miserable saith one,
should I bee, if I were the most richest of the
the world; with what a great burthen of evils
should I be over-whelmed? Why then should
a man torment himselfe for a thing that he must
necessarily leave? And why is hee not rather
content quietly with that which is needfull;
chiefly considering, that the fairest kinde of
wealth is for a man to be content in what estate
soever, that is, not to be too poore, nor yet too
farre off from poverty?</P>
<P>Hee set free abundance of his Kindred and
Friends which were fled into the Temple, and
did save them and theirs from the violence of
the Souldiers, to the number of a hundred and
fifty persons: so hee was sent by <HI>Titus</HI> with <HI>Ce|realis</HI>
with a thousand Horse to <HI>Tekoah,</HI> and
saved many of his Friends and Countrymen
by the way from misery and slavery, and got
some of them to bee released from their tor|ments.
<HI>Titus</HI> did so love him, that he gave him
great Possessions and Revenues, and tooke him
as his Companion when hee went for <HI>Rome.</HI>
Where hee was received with a great deale of
Honour, not only of <HI>Titus,</HI> but of <HI>Vespasianus</HI>
himselfe, and <HI>Domitianus</HI> and his Empresse; and
had an Annuall pension very large, given him by
the Emperour, and it was not taken from him
during life: he lived in <HI>Titus</HI> his owne Court in
<PB N="13" REF="11">
great esteeme, but not without the envy of his
own Nation: his second Wife was of <HI>Creta</HI> a
<HI>Iewesse,</HI> and nobly descended, by whom hee had
two sonnes.</P>
<P>Nay, even <HI>Domitianus</HI> himselfe continued
favourable unto him, and punished with death
some of his Accusers.</P>
<P>Hee was excellent for <HI>Philosophy</HI> and <HI>Rheto|rick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trithem. de Scrip. Ecc. fol. 5. l. 1.</NOTE>
and a famous <HI>Historiographer</HI> for his
time: he was for the excellencie of his Wit and

though being a <HI>Iew,</HI> yet hee did highly prayse
<HI>Christians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ant. Iud. l. 18.</NOTE> and gave a famous <HI>Testimony</HI> of our

<P>His Workes were so prized, that they with
great care were put into the publike Library by

<P>_IN the writing of this Fathers life, I
cannot but reverence his Antiquitie
and admire his Christian fortitude,
he is of such ancient extraction, that
he was one of those that enjoyed that for which
Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> wished, that is, <HI>to have seene the
Lord Iesus in the flesh,</HI> and though he did not as

his <HI>heart,</HI> and at last for <HI>his Name sake,</HI> endured
constant <HI>Martyrdome,</HI> and indeed it was a great

of all: and therefore he himselfe spoke it, that
<HI>even Kings and Prophets have desired to see the
<PB N="16" REF="13">
same.</HI> This great Star of the Church, is by other
Reverend Fathers reputed to have been twelve
yeeres old when our Saviour suffered. Hee was
the third Bishop of <HI>Antioch</HI> after Saint <HI>Peter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eus. Eccl. hist. l. 3. c. 30.</NOTE>

<HI>Zeale.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dionysius</HI> the <HI>Areopagite,</HI> Saint <HI>Bernard,</HI> and
others report a famous saying of Saint <HI>Ignatius;</HI>
which hee uttered with sighes, and is extant in
his Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and it is this, <GAP DESC="foreign">,
<HI>Amor meus crucifixus est,</HI> That is,
<HI>My Love is crucified.</HI> Either understanding by
the word <HI>Love,</HI> his Saviour Christ, whom hee
so dearly <HI>loved:</HI> or, else meaning that all his

<HI>dead</HI> in him, according to that of Saint <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">l,
Galat. 6. 14. The world is crucified unto mee,
and I unto the world.</HI> And no question, but
that our Saviour was planted deeply in his soul,
and for certainty, that he did see Christ after his
Resurrection, take his own words. <HI>Ego ver&ograve; &amp;

hee sets down the time and persons, when and
before whom it was: <HI>Et quando venit ad</HI> Petrum
<HI>&amp; adeos qui cum</HI> Petro <HI>erant.</HI> It was when hee
came to <HI>Peter,</HI> and to those that then were with
him, hee said, <HI>Touch and see, for a spirit hath not
flesh and bones as you see mee have, and they
touched him and believed:</HI> so that his own words

are sufficient proofs, but yet it is the consent of
all the Church Historians, as <HI>Eusebius</HI> and Saint

<P>As hee was led through <HI>Asia,</HI> with great cir|cumspection
by ten Souldiers, hee strived to do
good in all places whither hee came, for it may
be said of him as of the Apostles, That they
went about and confirmed the Churches: even
so this godly <HI>Ignatius</HI> with holy Discourses and
pious exhortations, did establish the Churches
in his Travels, and chiefly, (because at this time

<P>Hee sate Bishop of <HI>Antioch</HI> nine yeeres, in

of his Saviour, being alwayes wondrous strict

who then was at <HI>Antioch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Niceph. lib. 3. cap. 2. &amp; 19.</NOTE> and for that very

both by Sea and Land, both night and day I
fight with Beasts, and am chained amongst ten

bring me to <HI>Rome</HI> by <HI>Trajans</HI> command, who
though I do many benefits for them, yet are

better learned by their injuries. I could wish
that I could see those beasts that must teare mee,
I would speake fairely to them to dispatch mee
quickly, which if they shall refuse to doe, I will
incite them: Pardon mee, for now I begin to be
Christs Disciple, <HI>All things are of no esteeme

<P>What a proffer did this good old man bid

having so many enemies, as the World, the
Devil, and the Flesh, and inticements of friends,
which were as so many blocks laid in his way,
hindering, as it were, his passage to Heaven?</P>
<P>When the time of this <HI>Ignatius</HI> his Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">yr|dome
drew nigh, He used a saying, which Saint
<HI>Ierome</HI> in his Catalogue of Ecclesiasticall Wri|ters,
and Saint <HI>Irenaeus lib. 5. c.</HI> 28.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iren. l. 5 c. 28.</NOTE> do both re|member:

render it in English, thus: <HI>Now I am&punc; but Gods
Corne: when the wilde beasts shall have grinded
mee to powder with their teeth, I shall be his

<P>He used also to say, (and no doubt, but hee
found it true,) <HI>Nihil praestantius est pace Christi;</HI>
as <HI>Damascen</HI> relates in the first Booke of his Pa|rallels,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">8 Chapter, <HI>There is nothing better
then the peace of a good Conscience,</HI> then the
<PB N="21" REF="15">
<HI>peace of Christ.</HI> For his <HI>Humilitie,</HI> it was much,
for hee thought it no disparagement to learn of
any that could instruct him, for hee went to
schoole to learn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In vita Ignat. pag. 91.</NOTE> when hee was thirty yeeres of
age: Likewise hee thought himselfe so unwor|thy
to bee buried in any sanctified place; that
hee chose rather to bee buried on a dunghill,
or some common fields: Such was his humility,
that hee ever thought meanly of himselfe; and
always subjected his own spirit to the practice of
<HI>Vertue.</HI> This <HI>Vertue</HI> amongst all others, though
the lowest, yet holds the preheminence; this

<P>_THis <HI>Polycarpus</HI> was Disciple to Saint
<HI>Iohn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Niceph. cap. 30 &amp; 35. lib 3. Euseb. Ecc. h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">st l. 4. c. 13. Ruffi. cap. 50.</NOTE> and Bishop of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> when
<HI>Anicetus</HI> governed the <HI>Roman</HI>
Church, in the Reigne of <HI>M. Anto|ninus,</HI>
and <HI>Lucius Aurelius, Commodus</HI> being
<HI>Proconsul.</HI> This <HI>Polycarpe</HI> came to <HI>Rome,</HI> and
had great conference with <HI>Anicetus</HI> about the
Celebration of Easter, as <HI>Irenaeus</HI> doth testifie,
and in his third Book against Heresies, he speaks
largely in his prayse and commendation. This
<HI>Polycarpe</HI> was instituted by the Apostles them|selves,
and had great familiarity with them
which had seene the Lord Jesus in the flesh: hee
was sent into <HI>Asia,</HI> and there was made Bishop,
<PB N="25" REF="17">
and lived a long while to a very ripe age, so that
the Almond-tree did flourish in his gray haires.
Hee was wonderfull in esteeme and repute for
his reverend gravity, and chiefly because hee
taught nothing but what hee learned of the A|postles
themselves, and what the Catholike
Church delivered, and such points onely as were
really true and orthodox. And this all the Chur|ches
of <HI>Asia</HI> manifest, and all the Bishops which
succeeded him in that great dignitie. Hee was
not as <HI>Valentinus</HI> or <HI>Marcion,</HI> but <HI>testis fidelis
veritatis constansque,</HI> a faithfull and a constant
witnesse to the truth; nay, by his powerfull wis|dome
and singular piety, he recall'd and did re|duce
many from Heresie and Errour.</P>
<P>It is reported for certain, that <HI>Iohn</HI> the Lords
Disciple, and he, going to a Bath at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and
espying <HI>Cerinthus</HI> an Heretick in it, that he said
<HI>(fugiamus ocyus) &amp;c.</HI> Let us depart for feare
lest the Bath wherein the Lords Adversary is,
doe suddenly dispatch us: which indeed he had
just cause to feare; forasmuch as the places
where wicked men are, in a manner seeme to
detest their wickednesse: so that one of the Fa|thers
made hast out of the house of a wicked
man, and soon after it fell to the ground. Thus
this holy man <HI>Polycarpus</HI> shewed a great zeale &amp;
vigor of spirit for the defence of the truth. And
indeed, those Primitive Fathers were very cir|cumspect
and cautious how they kept company
with those whom they thought not to be sound
in the faith, imitating that rule of Saint <HI>Paul,
<PB N="26" REF="18">
An Heretick after the first and second admonition
shunne, knowing that such an one is fallen away,
being condemned in his own conscience.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be wondred, to thinke how constant
and couragious these Primitive Fathers were in
their sufferings. For they were not disheartned
when their bowels were ript up, when they rubd
with shels and rough stones, when their very
heart-strings were crackt in the fire, when there
were beasts appointed to teare them, nay, <HI>(per
quodcunque supplieiorum genus)</HI> whatsoever
punishment was laid upon them, they did re|joyce
in the middest of them, and so did this
<HI>Polycarpus,</HI> and <HI>Germanicus,</HI> and <HI>Ignatius.</HI></P>
<P>This blessed Martyr, when the Heathens did
cry out, <HI>quaeratur Polycarpus,</HI> kept his counte|nance
and resolution so firme, that it bred
amazement in his Friends, who would have had
him gone out of the City into some place, to
avoid the fury of his Adversaries, but hee
continued in devout prayers night and day, for
the Church of God, and for its peace: hee did
foretell to his Friend, that hee should die in the
flames for the Lord Jesus, when as they that
came to apprehend, were entred something
neere the place where hee was, his Friends
advised him to depart, which hee easily might
have done, but would not, and said, <HI>Domine,
fiat voluntas tua,</HI> Lord, let thy will be done.</P>
<P>And so came to them, whose countenance
when they beheld they were abashed much, but
he commanded meat to be set before them, and
<PB N="27" REF="18">
intreated them to eat heartily, and desired them
to give him respite but for one houre onely, in
which he prayed most fervently, for the pardon
of all his sinnes, and for the Catholike Church,
and so was upon a solemne day brought into the
Citie. <HI>Herod</HI> being <HI>Prefect,</HI> disswaded him not
to suffer that death, but to recant, and to enjoy
life and liberty; he constantly after a little pause
told him plaine, hee would not yield to his sug|gestions:
which when they saw, they drove him
in a Chariot with violence to the place of Mar|tyrdome,
and broke his leg in the journey: but
comming before the <HI>Proconsul,</HI> he did aske him
whether he was <HI>Polycarpus</HI> or not? to whom he
answered resolutely that hee was: then hee bad
him deny Christ and sweare by the Emperour:
to wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m <HI>Polycarpe</HI> replyed, <HI>Octoginta sex annos
illi jam inservivi, &amp;c.</HI> I have served him these
eighty six yeares, and all this time hee never did
mee any hurt, how can I then speake ill of my
King who hath kept me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">afe so long a time, and
cleerly did professe himselfe to be a Christian: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hen
the <HI>Proconsull</HI> told that hee had beasts in
readinesse to devoure him; and <HI>Polycarpus</HI> an|swered,
Bring them, for I am ready: then the
<HI>Proconsull</HI> said to him, that he would tame him
in the flames: but <HI>Polycarpus</HI> told him that they
were but momentany, and that he neither feared
beasts, nor fire, nor any other punishment. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
when they did see that hee would not be fright|ed,
they all with fury cryed out: <HI>Iste Asiae Do|ctor,
Christianorum pater, deorum nostrorum
<PB N="28" REF="19">
eversor.</HI> This is the Doctor of <HI>Asia,</HI> this is the
Father of Christians, this is hee that speaks
against our gods, and will not worship them.
So the fire being made, hee was cast into it; but
it was a strange thing, that the fire would not
burne him, but hee gave a smell as if of sweete
Odours and Confections, till at last they ranne
him through the bowels with a sword, and there
issued our so great a quantity of bloud, that it
amazed them all, and extinguished the flame.</P>
<P>Such was his holy detestation of Hereticks
and Enemies to the Religion of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Polycarpus. Euseb. Eccles. Hist.</NOTE> that
when <HI>Marcion</HI> an Arch-heretick, but one of his
acquaintance, met him in the street at <HI>Rome,</HI> and
wondring that he took no notice of him, said
unto him, <HI>Dost thou not know mee Polycarpus?</HI>
yea, said he, <HI>I know thee well, thou art the eldest
sonne unto the Devill.</HI></P>
<P>When the Proconsul had urged <HI>Polycarpus,</HI> as
much as in him lay to deny Christ, Hee made
this answer to him, as before; <HI>I have served him
eighty six yeeres, and hee hath not once hurt mee,
and shall I now deny him?</HI></P>
<P>And when hee was come to the place of his
Martyrdome, the stake being fastned in the
ground, and the wood ready to be kindled; they
began to tie him to the stake with iron chains;
and he required to stand untied, saying; <HI>Let mee
alone, (I pray you) for hee that gave mee strength
to come to this fire, will also give mee patience to
abide in the same without your tying.</HI> Indeed
that man which is accustomed to patience,
<PB N="29" REF="19">
will never quit or forsake any place for any pain
or trouble whatsoever: for the paines and per|plexities
that good and vertuous men doe en|dure
and suffer, doe, as it were, prick them for|wards
to have a more earnest desire to loath, and
to leave this wretched and sinfull World; whose
sweetest pleasures (as the wise man sayth,)
are as sower Grapes; whose greatest
Honours are fading and false flourishes;
whose profits and riches are but poysoned baits
to intrap men: therefore happy are they that
have a good and a quiet soule, for it is given
them from above.</P>
<P>For if we consider man according to the <HI>life,</HI>
we shall find him full of vanity, weaknesse, in|constancy,
misery, and presumption: a fruitfull
Argument to divert him from all singularity.
And he that will avoyde trouble and sorrow,
must apply his mind to wisedome.</P>
<P>This <HI>Polycarpus</HI> wrote many things, most of
which are kept in the <HI>Vatican.</HI> There is extant
an Epistle of his to the <HI>Philippians.</HI></P>

<HI>Chrysostome</HI> doe well note, hee lived in the man|agement
of State Affaires, and administred Ju|stice
with admirable discretion, and most men
wondred at him for his prudence and Philo|sophy.</P>
<P>At the same time, Saint <HI>Paul</HI> the Doctor of the
<HI>Gentiles</HI> came to <HI>Athens,</HI> and taught them there
true divine Philosophy, driving away, and over|throwing
all the Sects of vain philosophy, as of
the <HI>Epicures, Stoicks, Academicks, Peripateticks,</HI>
who at the time resided in <HI>Athens,</HI> and were
highly esteemed of: but when Saint <HI>Paul</HI> was
entred into the Citie, hee saw an Altar with this
Inscription; <HI>Ignoto Deo:</HI> From which Saint
<HI>Paul</HI> as a wise and prudent Preacher, took occa|sion
to preach to them the true <HI>God,</HI> who is the
<HI>Creator</HI> of <HI>all things.</HI></P>
<P>There was in the same City a high and emi|nent
place of Judicature whereon 12 Judges
sate to censure Malefactors and Offenders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why called Areopagite?</NOTE> and
thereupon that place was called <HI>Are<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pagus,</HI> or
<HI>Mars</HI> his Hill; and those that were appointed
<HI>Iudges</HI> to sit in that place were for their severi|ty
and integrity called <HI>Areopagites.</HI> It so fell out
that Saint <HI>Paul</HI> preaching of the true <HI>God,</HI> as
also of the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> and the <HI>Iudgement</HI> of
the <HI>World,</HI> was accounted by all those great phi|losophers
as a wicked and sacrilegious person:
and so being brought to this place before the
<HI>Iudges,</HI> he did with that <HI>Divine Eloquence,</HI> and
<PB N="33" REF="21">
with such forcible <HI>Arguments</HI> convince those
<HI>Philosophers:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dionysius <HI>and his wife</HI> La maris co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ver|ted by St. Paul <HI>to the true Faith.</HI></NOTE> and by the great blessing of God
did convert this <HI>Dionysius</HI> President and chiefe
of the Judges, with <HI>Damaris</HI> his Wife, who used
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> courteously: and were instructed by
him in the knowledge of our <HI>Lord Iesus Christ:</HI>
at the knowledge of this the whole City of
<HI>Athens</HI> was amazed, because that this <HI>Dionysius</HI>
was reputed of all men to be a most wise and
judicious man; but <HI>Dionysius</HI> was not ashamed
of a <HI>Master</HI> to become a <HI>Scholer,</HI> and exprest to
the whole Church, how that he magnified this

<P>And so staying a good while in <HI>Athens,</HI> he did
with great labour and wisdome <HI>preach</HI> the <HI>Word
of God.</HI> For he as a wise <HI>Harvest-man</HI> brought

the <HI>Church,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dionysius</HI> journey to visit St. <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Ephesus.</HI></NOTE> and so he went to <HI>Ephesus,</HI> to visit S.
<HI>Paul,</HI> and see S. <HI>Iohn</HI> now returned out of <HI>Path|mos</HI>
from Banishment, by whose perswasion, <HI>Cle|mens</HI>
then governing the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> this
<HI>Dionysius</HI> repaired to <HI>Rome,</HI> (&amp; having done his
spirituall worke at <HI>Athens)</HI> and left one <HI>Publius</HI>
to look to that <HI>Flocke,</HI> Hee was by the said <HI>Cle|ment</HI>
authorized to goe into <HI>France,</HI> to preach
the Word there, and to give knowledge of
salvation to that Nation; and <HI>France</HI> was at that
time a fit place to plant the Gospel in; but the
<PB N="34" REF="22">
first Labourers were martyred, that were sent
thither, hereupon, this <HI>Dionysius</HI> took his fel|low-labourers
in this journey, and work, one
<HI>Rusticus</HI> a priest, <HI>Eleutherius</HI> a Deacon, and <HI>Eu|genius,</HI>
&amp; some others <HI>Eugenius</HI> he sent to <HI>Spain,</HI>
who setling at <HI>Toledo,</HI> was there first Archbishop,
afterwards going into <HI>France,</HI> was martyred.</P>
<P><HI>Dionysius</HI> comming into <HI>France,</HI> esteemed that
<HI>Paris</HI> would be the fittest place to reside in; and
there hee found himselfe not frustrated of his
expectation, for in a short space, hee brought
many <HI>sheep</HI> into the <HI>fold</HI> of <HI>Christ;</HI> not onely
in <HI>Paris,</HI> but also in many other places, and those
that were converted were not of the meaner
sort, but many rich, noble and great persons,
who being converted overthrew the Temples
of their false gods, and erected new places for
<HI>Divine Worship.</HI></P>
<P>But the common enemy of the Church of
Christ, seeing and observing this happy pro|gresse,
that this Kingdome would be weakned,
if this doctrine was maintained: Whereupon
hee began to contrive plots and malicious pro|jects,
how to hinder the work of this <HI>Dionysius.</HI>
And thereupon put it into the mindes of those
Idolatrous priests by their malice to hasten his
death; but marke the over-ruling hand of
God, although many were sent armed secretly
to dispatch him; yet there was such a gracious
lustre and radiancie in his countenance and gra|vity:
that some of their hearts failed them when
they beheld him, and they repented of their
<PB N="35" REF="22">
intent, and many others were cast into a sud|den
feare, and fled from the performance. See
but how strong God is over the actions of wic|ked<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">men,
who though they would, yet cannot
act any thing beyond Gods divine disposall.</P>
<P>As there is nothing so sacred, but there will
be still found in all ages sacrilegious hands to
attempt and touch it: And though there be not
wanting multitudes of men, whose tongues and
hands have no other imployment, but to defile,
and diminish so much as in them lyeth, the ho|nour
of God, and of good men; yet for all
that, the vertuous mans minde is not a whit
daunted or lesse assured then before. And most
men know, that the vertue and vigour of him
who in fighting hath vanquished his enemy, is
alwayes greater then his, who did never try the
combat at all. Even so may wee think and say of
the vertuous, constant and well disposed person:
who, like to good metall, the more he is fired,
the more hee is fined; the more hee is hated and
opposed, the more is he approved: For wrongs
and attempts may well try him, touch him, or
prick him; but they cannot imprint in him any
false stampe: Many out of envy and malicious
disposition, may attempt and set upon a just and
upright man, and assaile him both by words and
actions, yet not injure him; for in that case hee
is like a brazen wall, which the darts of the wic|ked
cannot pierce through; but rather rebound
on their owne breasts. And though that such
mischievous and malicious men levell right at
<PB N="36" REF="23">
him to hit, and to hurt him with their harmfull
shafts; yet doe they come short of their aymes:
for either they hit him not; or if they doe, they
hurt him not at all. Therefore let all good and
vertuous men be qualified and comforted, and
with patience and peaceable playsters; such as
are joy, exultation, and delight: for these will
bring him unto greater content, then humanitie
can imagine.</P>
<P>But suddenly after, <HI>Hescennius Sisinnius</HI> the
<HI>Praefect,</HI> gave command that <HI>Dionysius</HI> with his
fellows should be apprehended: and when hee
was taken, <HI>Sisinnius</HI> had much talke with him;
and did much reprove him and blame him, for
that hee had preached against the worship of
their Gods; and because by his Sermons, their
gods had lost their former honour and worship;
and seriously charged him to confesse his errour,
and to stop up that breach which hee had made,
to leave off those novelties, and unheard of
doctrines grounded upon no sufficient warrant,
or solidities, that so the people by this recanta|tion
might see how vainly they were seduced;
and so returne to their ancient Rites and Cu|stomes
againe. To whom <HI>Dionysius</HI> answered,
(not without a great deale of <HI>Constancie</HI> and
<HI>Zeal</HI> mixed with <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Divine Eloquence)</HI>
how that they were no gods whom they wor|shipped,
and how that they were but Idols, the
worke of mens hands, and that it was meere
folly, ignorance and Idolatry to adore them;
and added that there was but one God, which
<PB N="37" REF="23">
he preached: at which words spoken with so
deepe a resolution; <HI>Sisinnius</HI> was wondrously
incensed and angry, and commanded him to be
laid upon an hurdle, and a gentle fire to be put
under to roast him. <HI>Hildrinus</HI> relates that hee
was cast to wilde beasts that were kept hungry,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hildrin.</HI> in ejus vita c. 32.</NOTE>
but they would not teare him, and how hee was
throwne into an Oven made hot, but the fire
did not seise upon him: but hee was the second
time with his fellow-labourers brought before
<HI>Sisinnius,</HI> and they were publikely beaten with
cruell and many blows by the Officers. But the
Judge perceiving their valour and unmoveable
courage, that they were not at all daunted with
thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> dealings: He standing up, commanded in
a rage, that seeing they had contemned their
gods, derided the Emperours Edicts, that they
had wrought by Magicke and other unlawfull
Arts (as with Miracles) to delude the people,
that they had seduced the people, and had drawn
them from their obedience to the Emperour,
to their faction and part, that although these
things came upon them for their faults; and
that they might be punished by the Emperour,
for suffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing such Seducers to remayne in the
Confines of his Empire, commanded them
fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th-with to be beheaded. At which this Saint
<HI>Dionysius, Rusticus,</HI> and <HI>Eleutherius</HI> were not
any whit terrified, but with joy and mirth an|swered,
that all they who worshipped such gods
were like them, and would perish even as the
dung of the earth. But as for us (said <HI>Dionysius)
<PB N="38" REF="24">
Come life or death, we will worship the God of Hea|ven
and earth.</HI></P>
<P>At these words of these holy men, the Judges
anger was kindled like fire, and gave strict
charge that their execution should not be de|ferr'd;
and so they were haled out of the Citie
to the top of an high Mountaine, and delivered
to the Officers and Executioners to be tormen|ted,
which was accomplished with all the cruel|ty
that could be; at the time of <HI>Dionysius</HI> his
beheading, he devoutly lifting up his hands and
eyes to the God of Heaven expressed himselfe
in this prayer.</P>
<P>DOmine, Deus omnipotens, Filiunigenite, &amp;
Sancte Spiritus, Sancta Trinitas, principio
carens, &amp; in quem non cadit divisio, suscipe ser|vorum
tuorum in pace animas, quoniam propter
te morte afficimur.</P>
<P>Which deserves to be registred in letters of
Gold. I have thus Englished it.</P>
<P>O Lord, God Almighty, thou onely begotten
Sonne, and holy Spirit; O Sacred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rinity,
which art without beginning, in whom is no divi|sion:
Receive the souls of thy servants in peace,
who are put to death for thy Cause and Gospell:
<HI>to which</HI> Rusticus <HI>and</HI> Eleutherius <HI>answered,</HI>
Amen.</P>
<P>Which prayer being ended, at the command
<PB N="39" REF="24">
of the Ruler, they were beheaded with a sword
that was made dull, that so their paine in their
Martyrdome might be the greater.</P>
<P>These worthy Martyrs suffered the eighth of
the Ides of <HI>October,</HI> in the Reigne of the Em|perour
<HI>Hadrianus;</HI> in the 110 yeere of <HI>Diony|sius</HI>
his age. It is true that <HI>Metaphrastes, Hil|drinus,
Hincmarus</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Rhemes,</HI> and
others doe say that hee suffered under the Em|peror
<HI>Domitian</HI> in the ninety first yeere of his
age: but they are deceived, for <HI>Dionysius</HI> in a
certaine Epistle which hee writ to <HI>Iohn</HI> being

in the tenth booke. But <HI>Photius</HI> doth amongst

begins in these words, <HI>Est autem vir ille ad Phi|losophiae
tum nostrae tum potissimum prophanae
summum evectus fastigium, &amp;c.</HI> which is, That
this man came to a great height, not onely of
our philosophy, but also of that which is coun|ted
prophane, flowing in the copiousnesse and
abundance of all sorts of learning and histories,
and knew very well how to beautifie and adorn
his words with Rhetoricall expressions. Hence
was it that hee was so able to deliver his mind
in apt termes and significant phrases, so that
those things that came from him were wonder|full
emphaticall, patheticall, and significant; and
work'd much upon the souls of his Auditors.</P>
<P>Hee was sonne to <HI>Pris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us Bacchius,</HI> hee was

delight in <HI>Rome,</HI> and therefore hee chose that to
be the seat of his residence, where both in speech,
life, and habit, he professed himselfe a Philoso|pher:
but he made his philosophy subservient to
his sacred studie of divinity, and would say, He
kept it for use, and that in his studies he found
great profit by it. <HI>Tritenhemius</HI> the famous Ab|bat
of <HI>Spanheim</HI> in his collections of the ancient

prayses him for that, according to his due

discovering the Heresie of the <HI>Valentinians:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baron. Tom. 2. p. 111.</NOTE> he

famous for sanctity, worth and excellencie, who
by their dexterous Writings, supprest the Here|sie
of <HI>Valentinus,</HI> as <HI>Iustin Martyr:</HI> so that it
easily doth appeare, that he did not onely suffer
much for his Saviours cause, but also did much
study and accustome himself to defend it against
all oppositions in his time. For custome is a se|cond
nature: and when the <HI>soule</HI> takes delight in
any vertue, it is gain'd upon by an usuall and
customary iteration.</P>
<P>He began to flourish in the Reigne of <HI>Anto|ninus
<PB N="45" REF="27">
Pius,</HI> and in the time of <HI>Telesphorus,</HI> as
doth appeare by his Apologie, which hee dedi|cates

God, so that hee did cause many to come out
of that miserable condition, and cherefully
to embrace the Faith of our <HI>Saviour Christ
crucified.</HI></P>
<P>But to conclude, the <HI>Bibliotheca veterum Pa|trum,</HI>
doth sufficiently speake for him, and re|gister
his worth, and parts, to succeeding Ages.
One of the first after the apostles times, whose
writings wee enjoy was <HI>Iustin Martyr,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Biblioth. Pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. Tom. 2 pag 1&punc;</NOTE> who flo|rished
in the time of <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> and his
<PB N="46" REF="28">
successors, <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> and <HI>Lucius Verus.</HI>
And in his apology to the senate and people of
<HI>Rome</HI> he writes, that there were from the nati|vity
of Christ 150 yeares to his daies. Hee did
not live free from malicious men: But the chiefe
of all his adversaries and accusers, <HI>Qui carbone
notandus,</HI> was <HI>Crefcens</HI> a Cynick Philosopher,
but no ways deserving the name, who was a man
of a corrupted life, and wholly addicted and
given up to Luxury and Gluttony, and many
other vices: hee was the incarnate Devill, that
never left off his accusation of this worthy In|strument,
and at last by his malice and envy, got
opportunity against him, because he was a faith|full
Christian.</P>
<P>It is observed, that the envious man doth not
beare envy so much to the persons of those
whom they envy, as they do to the good things
which are in them. Envy, indeed, is the Mistris
of injustice, and it inciteth both the thought and
the hand to all kinde of ill and wicked actions:
for when the condition of another man is just,
upright, and cheerfull; then is envy most plot|ting
and contriving, sad and sorrowfull. And
whosoever beareth envy to any good man, and
doing well, it may well be said of him: That
he is not only envious to the Common-wealth,
but to himselfe also, and in the end will be his
own destruction.</P>
<P>It is a principall point of <HI>wisedome,</HI> truly to
know how to esteeme of <HI>life;</HI> for hee that estee|meth
and loveth his <HI>life</HI> for the love of it selfe,
<PB N="47" REF="28">
he lives not but to live: But a wise man lives no
longer, then that his <HI>life</HI> may be worth more
then his <HI>death;</HI> A great part of <HI>life</HI> is <HI>lost</HI> to
those that <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> ill;</HI> a <HI>greater</HI> to those that <HI>doe no|thing;</HI>
and all, to those that <HI>do</HI> that they should
<HI>not do:</HI> But the <HI>actions</HI> of a well grounded and
advised man tend alwayes to some <HI>certain</HI> and
good <HI>end;</HI> and what he purposeth, hee bringeth
to perfection; because his intendments end
in performances of good and vertuous con|clusions.</P>
<P>This <HI>Iustin Martyr</HI> used to say of the Chri|stians
in his time;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ep. ad Diogne|tum.</NOTE> that which the <HI>soule</HI> is in the
<HI>body,</HI> that are <HI>Christians</HI> in the <HI>World:</HI> for as the
soule is <HI>in</HI> the body, but not <HI>of</HI> the body; so do
Christians dwell in the World, but are no part
of it.</P>
<P><HI>He had divers other Sayings;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apud Anton. Melissam, lib. 1. se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m.</NOTE> <HI>especially these
two: First,</HI> It is best of all not to sinne; <HI>it is next
to that,</HI> to amend upon the punishment: <HI>Second|ly,</HI>
That it is the greatest slavery in the World, to
be subject to ones own passions.</P>
<P>But moderate <HI>passions</HI> are the most affable ex|pressions
of <HI>humanity: passions</HI> must not be too
fierie, nor yet too dull; but there ought to be a
mean betwixt both: For the first are like Horses
that endanger those that ride them; and the
later prove a trouble to the Guide: The one will
not be backt by any, and the other will be abu|sed
by any: a good <HI>temper</HI> is a sure <HI>expression</HI>
of a well composed <HI>Soule.</HI> Therefore the onely
way to live worthily, and die with prayse; is to
<PB N="48" REF="29">
be noble in our actions, honest in our intentions,
and temperate in our tongues.</P>
<P>But this envy, though of a long continuance,
no whit daunted <HI>Iustin,</HI> for hee did suffer his
Martyrd me cheerfully, and willingly surren|dred
his soule into his Saviours protection;
Saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He was behea|ded in the yeere 149, or 150.</NOTE> <HI>My life is neere finished; and while I li|ved,

Melissus, Anastatius,</HI> and <HI>Damascen.</HI> His
<PB N="50" REF="30">
exquisite skill and dexterity in searching into
the secrets of Heresies doth sufficiently mani|fest,
that hee was excellent for Philosophy. For
usually Heresies have had their springing from
Philosophy, his acute and witty Disputations
with them, and his cleere refutation of them do
speake his learning; besides the Order and Me|thod
hee uses, with the Prefaces before his
Books, besides his demonstrating how that He|resies
have not onely oppositions and some con|tradictions
in themselves, but that they do plain|ly
thwart and crosse the truth of all Churches,
and the Writings of the Prophets, Apostles, and
Evangelists, which hee proves in his first and
foure last Books; but the nineteenth Chapter of
his second Booke, manifests his generality of
Learning: First, by refuting all their sophisti|cated
arguments and ungrounded positions,
which hee proves to be onely fetcht out of the
Fables of Poets and Philosophers, herein shew|ing
that hee had well vers'd himselfe in <HI>Thales,
Anaximander, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Em|pedocles,
Plato,</HI> and <HI>Aristotle:</HI> so also in most
Tragick, Comick, and Lyrick Poets; Seeing in

<HI>Proverbs,</HI> and <HI>Examples;</HI> hence is it
that <HI>Tertullian</HI> doth stile him, <HI>Omnium Doctri|narum

of Learning.</P>
<P>And God having laid him out for a famous
<PB N="51" REF="30">
Instrument in his Church, <HI>Irenaeus</HI> sets himselfe
seriously and ardently to the study of the sacred
Scriptures, and did take wonderfull paines and
delight in that studie: and for his better helpe
this way, he put himselfe to <HI>Polycarpus,</HI> to be his
Scholler, which had not onely heard Saint <HI>Iohn,</HI>
but most of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> which had seen <HI>Christ</HI>
in the flesh; and no question, it was a great joy
to that old Father, to see that hee should have
Children who would be constant professours of
the Faith in <HI>Christ Iesus:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Euseb. Eccles. Histor. lib. 5. cap. 19.</NOTE> and <HI>Eusebius</HI> gives
him that prayse, that he did truly observe all the
sweet speeches that fell from <HI>Polycarpus</HI> lips, and
omitted nothing that hee spake of <HI>Christ</HI> his
<HI>Actions, Miracles,</HI> or <HI>Passion.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, hee was not onely with <HI>Polycarpe,</HI> but
also with <HI>Papias</HI> Bishop of <HI>Hierapolis,</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and <HI>Aristion,</HI> with other
who were all excellently Learned and Aposto|licall
men, and he did eagerly desire the compa|ny
of such as had conversed with the Apostles,
for so he made himselfe the abler to contradict
all Gainsayers: so that Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> and Saint
<HI>Epiphanius</HI> terme him the true Register of the
Apostles actions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epiph. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> Hierom. in cap. 36. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE></P>

it is, that when <HI>Photinus</HI> was ninety yeeres
old, and when hee with divers other Martyrs
departed this life, that Saint <HI>Irenaeus</HI> returning

<P>His enterance into it was full of danger, un|quiet

by the prayers of the Christians, so that they
lived securely, and held Councels, and did preach

<P>But divers weedes sprung up againe to di|sturb

with <HI>Blastus</HI> and <HI>Florinus;</HI> and the East|ern
Church was disquieted with a great deal of
contention about the celebration of <HI>Easter:</HI> but

<HI>Lions,</HI> refuted <HI>Blastus</HI> and <HI>Florinus</HI> follies,
and was mightily studious to settle the <HI>Churches</HI>
about Easters celebration. He lived in <HI>Antonius,
Commodus,</HI> and <HI>Severus</HI> Reignes; being about
182 yeeres after Christ, but this <HI>Severus</HI> being
a cruel man against the Christians, rais'd the fifth
persecution against them, wherein many Mar|tyrs
were crowned. But most of all, it raged at
<HI>Lions,</HI> in so much that the blood of slaughtered
Christians ran down the streets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Turo. lib. cap. 29.</NOTE> so that their
names could not be told, nor numbred, but God
hath written them in the Book of Life: at last,
this blessed Saint was by the slaughter-man laid
out to death with the greatest part of that Ci|tie,
on the fourth of the Calends of <HI>Iuly,</HI> as <HI>Tri|themius</HI>
about the sixtieth yeere of his age, o|ther
say the ninetieth. There is great dispute
among <HI>Historians,</HI> about the yeere of our Lord,
in which he died; but it is certaine, that he with
divers others were set betweene two Hils, there
being a Crosse on the one, and an Idoll on the
other, being put to choice, which way he would
goe, either to the Crosse and so suffer, or to the
Idoll and live; Hee and all they chose to suffer
Martyrdome, and so were all put to death.</P>
<P>His bones as relicks, were reserved with great
care, and laid in rest untill the yeare 1562. they
were digd up in that furious and raging cruelty
of the <HI>Hierognosticks,</HI> who neither spared dead
nor living, nor Temples, Altars, nor any holy
things, but spoiled all, and cast part of his

and lived till the reign of <HI>Antoninus
Caracalla,</HI> as himselfe witnesseth, in
his first book against <HI>Marcion,</HI> as also in other
places. <HI>Pamelius</HI> who wrote his life, sayes, That
it was when <HI>Victor</HI> was Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> who
was an <HI>African</HI> borne; and when as <HI>Septimius
Severus</HI> was Emperour, that then this <HI>Tertullian</HI>
an <HI>African,</HI> was famous also in the <HI>Church.</HI> There
have beene those who have striven about two
Questions; first, concerning the knowledge of
this <HI>Tertullian;</HI> from one <HI>Tertullus</HI> a <HI>Consul;</HI> and
from one <HI>Tertyllianus,</HI> a Counsellour: as also
<PB N="59" REF="34">
from one <HI>Tertullinus</HI> a Martyr. The second que|stion
is about the time wherein this our <HI>Tertul|lianus</HI>
lived: some will have him to be conver|ted
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e Faith, in the yeere of Christ, 160. but
that is rejected, but <HI>Eusebius</HI> and others do with
better judgement place him in the yeere of our
Lord 200.</P>
<P>I cannot let passe in the first place, the cause
of the multiplicity of his names. All Antiqua|ries
do hold that he was called <HI>Quinctus, &agrave; loco
in quo natus:</HI> from the place in which hee was
borne: which was his <HI>praenomen</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sed by the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI>
as <HI>Onuphrius</HI> testifies, and cites some so
called, as <HI>Quinct a Septimia,</HI> a famous Matrone.
<HI>Septimius</HI> was added to him <HI>&agrave; Gente;</HI> from his
stock which was amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> both <HI>Re|gall,

doe suppose this <HI>Tertullians</HI> stock to be very
noble. The <HI>Cognomen,</HI> or Sirname of <HI>Florens</HI>
denotes a certain Family of that Race of <HI>Septi|mius:</HI>
As for his name <HI>Tertullianus,</HI> it is a deri|vative
of <HI>Tertullus,</HI> as <HI>Octavianus</HI> of <HI>Octavus,</HI>
and as <HI>Septimius,</HI> of <HI>Septimus.</HI> It is concluded
by <HI>Eusebius</HI> and Saint <HI>Ierome,</HI> that this <HI>Tertul|lianus</HI>
was an <HI>Affrican</HI> borne, the sonne of a
<HI>Proconsul;</HI> which also is affirmed by <HI>Isidorus,
Nicephorus,</HI> and <HI>Beda:</HI> and more specially to be
of the Citie of <HI>Carthage.</HI></P>
<P>For his <HI>Institution</HI> he was happy, for it was
excellent, and hee was as industrious to adde
<PB N="60" REF="35">
what could be had by study: his Works against
the <HI>Gentiles</HI> testifie his able parts, which accord|ing
to Saint <HI>Ieroms</HI> words; <HI>Cunctam saeculi con|tinent
disciplinam,</HI> that is, they containe all sorts
of Learning. He was well read in <HI>Poets, Gram|marians,
Histories,</HI> and <HI>Lawes.</HI> Hee was well
seene in <HI>Physicks</HI> and <HI>Philosophy. Lactantius</HI> says,
hee was <HI>in omni genere doctrinae peritus:</HI> well
skild in all kinde of Learning. <HI>Eusebius</HI> stiles
him, <HI>Peritia rerum &amp; legum Romanorum cla|rum:</HI>
He knew well and dexterously the affaires
and Lawes of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Saint <HI>Ierome</HI> sayes,
he was, <HI>Acris &amp; vehementis ingenii, vir erudi|tus,
quo nihil eruditius, &amp;c.</HI> That hee had a
sharpe and pregnant wit; that there was none
more learned than himselfe. Saint <HI>Austine</HI> stiles
him, <HI>Disertissimum;</HI> a most discreet man: <HI>Ni|cephorus</HI>
calls him, <HI>Eloquentia acrem &amp; pollen|tem:</HI>
powerfull in his Eloquence and Oratory:
but hee that will see his large prayse, let him
read <HI>Vincentius Lyrinensis:</HI> His words I have
Englished; <HI>Inter Latinos omnes hic facile prin|ceps
judicandus,</HI> that is, Amongst the <HI>Latine</HI>
Writers, hee is chiefly accounted of, for
what learning greater then his? Who more
exercised in all divine and humane knowledge?
For he was expert in all <HI>Philosophy;</HI> He knew all
<HI>Sects,</HI> their <HI>Authors, Defendors, Abettors, Ar|guments,
Fallacies:</HI> hee was full of all <HI>History:</HI>
his wit was able to decide any <HI>Controversies;</HI> and
that with forcible <HI>Arguments:</HI> hee convinced
any Opposite hee undertook judiciously: who
<PB N="61" REF="35">
can sufficiently blazon his prayses? Each word is
a <HI>Sentence:</HI> all his constructions <HI>victorious.</HI> He
wrote many Workes that were necessary for
<HI>Christians:</HI> which are all so copiously adorned
and beautified, with such solid Reasons, that
they are able to drive any one to his opinions:
Some do stile him harsh and crabbed, which is
supposed came to him, by his daily reading
<HI>Greeke</HI> Authors: Hee was not so harsh, but hee
was as beneficiall for his <HI>Matter;</HI> and this wit
hee shewed even in his youth; thus and more
copiously doth he set him forth, and (under the
correction of better judgement) set but his too
severe faults and imperfections aside: look not
too rigidly upon his fall. For those subjects
which hee wrote of, I dare say it, none perfor|med
them more solidly, or devoutly: and it is
thought by candide Divines, it was his too
much addicting himself to the strictnesse of life,
his too deep austerity that caused his fall: how
ever, the most eminent Lights of the Church
have had their imperfections; it is so by the
Divine permission, and Satans malice; and what
if to this end? That Men may know them|selves
so; and to render all glory to God: and
my conclusion concerning his fall, it shall be
vaild with the Mantle of Charity; and let
mee say thus much of it, and seriously professe,
When I read him, I admire him. His Disci|pline
may be too rigid for these more licentious
times. But if it was as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> sayes, <HI>Contun|dere
corpus,</HI> to beat downe his proud flesh, that
<PB N="62" REF="36">
always rebels against the spirit, who can justly
blame him? his method and practice may be
harsh and difficult, his intention and aime can|not
but be commendable: though he a little mi|stook
the method, yet if he attaind the end, may
wee not conclude him an happy Conquerour?
For his Heresie, of which he stands guilty, have
not all Ages shunn'd that Rock, and yet enter|taine
<HI>Tertullian?</HI> For certaine, his errour was
grosse, but why may not that famous Tract of
his, <HI>de Poenitentia,</HI> make amends for it? Hee is
gold, though not altogether refined; so, nor to
to be refused. Wheat he is; who not through|ly
clensed, yet may be placed in the Garner:
perfectly good he is not, yet not to be despised;
for then who should not? And what pen is that
in Writing never made blot? but I doe not here
intend a discovery of his faults, but rather of his
excellencies: and so I say to all; <HI>Let him that
thinketh he standeth, take heed least he fall.</HI></P>
<P>Hee liv'd to his Clymactericall yeere, and as
Saint <HI>Ierome,</HI> and <HI>Nicephorus</HI> relate it, hee in the
middle of his Age made this declension: but
this <HI>Pamelius</HI> whom I follow for the descrip|tion
of his life, sayes, that hee fell into it in the
53 yeere of his age: and why might it not please
God to give him a recovery before the revolu|tion
of ten yeeres, when it may by his <HI>Divine
providence</HI> be effected in ten minutes? And how
usuall it is with God, to bring light of darknes,
and to make crooked things straight; hee that
knowes it not, is not acquainted with Gods
<PB N="63" REF="36">
mercifull dealing towards penitent and relent|ing
Sinners.</P>
<P>In the yeere then of our Lord 194. It seems
that this <HI>Tertullian</HI> was unconverted from Hea|thenisme,
for such an one hee was, by his owne
confession: When he writes of the Resurrection
from Death, the last judgement, the joys of
Heaven, and punishments of Hell, he saith, <HI>Haec|nos
aliquando risimus, cum de vobis fuimus: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iunt,
non nascuntur Christiani.</HI> I laughed, and thought
scorne of such points, when I was (of you)
(meaning Heathens); but now I see wee are not
borne, but made Christians.</P>
<P>But for that time which hee passed before his
conversion to the Faith, it will not be so much
materiall for our purpose. Though he was inge|nuous
and powerfull in pleading Causes at the
Barre; Yet will we not insist upon him as follow|ing
that course of life, but take him in his time,
wherein he saith: <HI>Cancellos non adorior, Subsellia
non contundo, Iura non conturbo, Causas non
elatro: plus Togaelaesere Rempublicam qu&agrave;ni Lo|ricae.</HI>
that is, I follow not the Laws, plead not at
the Barres, beat not the Desks, disturbe not the
Laws; doe not baule out any Causes. The
Lawyers Gownes have hurt the Common-wealth,
as much as the Souldiers Helmets.</P>
<P>The means as <HI>Nicephorus</HI> and <HI>Eusebius</HI> guesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Niceph. l. 5. c 2&punc; Eccles. Hist.</NOTE>
by which this <HI>Tertullian</HI> was converted, was
thus. The <HI>Iews</HI> being by <HI>Adrian</HI> forbidden to
returne home againe after their Warres, they
wandred, saith <HI>Tertullian,</HI> up and downe, ha|ving
<PB N="64" REF="37">
neither home, nor friend, without any
man to comfort them, and without God their
King. So that at the beginning of <HI>Severus</HI>
Reigne, <HI>Bono statures nostrae fuere,</HI> Our affairs
went well: and the Christian Faith daily tooke
a larger augmentation; by the famous Writings
and Preachings of excellent Ecclesiasticall Wri|ters
and Preachers. And it was not promoted
in obscure and little Villages, but in the most
eminent and renowmed Cities, to wit, <HI>Alexan|dria,
Antioch, Aelia,</HI> through all <HI>Palestine,</HI> as also
in <HI>Ephesus, Caesarea,</HI> and towards the Westerne
Parts. At <HI>Thessalonica, Athens, Corinth;</HI> in <HI>Gaule,</HI>
or <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Rome.</HI> For whole Families, nay,
great multitudes came and embraced the faith;
being ready to doe or suffer any thing for the
defence of it. At the same time, there were
worthy Writers, and diligent Preachers (as <HI>Eu|sebius</HI>
reports) to some of which this <HI>Tertullian</HI>
was bound for ever to give God thanks for his
conversion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tom. 1. Apolog. c. 5. n. 65. 70. &amp; 71.</NOTE> as he witnesseth himselfe: as at <HI>Alex|andria,

bloud, and incest: which were all refuted by

<P>And in the sixteenth yeere of <HI>Severus</HI> Reigne,
there were many Heresies sprung up, and spread

handled them in generall, but (God willing) we
will answer them all in particular: At the end
of the worke hee makes a Catalogue of all the
Heretickes that then tore the bowels of the
Church. He first takes those foure of the <HI>Iewes.

<P>In the eleventh yeere of <HI>Severus</HI> Reigne,

twas his worke, and hee was resolved to
performe it, an infallible demonstration of a
noble and unconquered spirit, not to desist from
good actions, though times prove dangerous.</P>
<P>So, likewise, in the thirteenth of <HI>Severus,</HI> did
he not as worthily withstand the proceeding of
some <HI>Libertines,</HI> as well at <HI>Carthage</HI> as elswhere,
who strive to corrupt the Christians by their

time how did hee stop an Heresie arising in <HI>Af|frick,</HI>
called the <HI>Apelletians,</HI> from one <HI>Apel|les:</HI>

<P>I read not after this, that <HI>Tertullian</HI> did write
any thing for the Church, but against it, The
more is the pitie, so great a Scholer should fall
so fouly. There are many Fathers who have dis|coursed
what might be the cause of this <HI>Tertul|lians</HI>

the authority of the <HI>Primitive Fathers;</HI> to
overthrow such Heresies as are broach'd in our

<P>_THis eminent Writer, who was Scho|ler
to <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus,</HI> was
called by two names, some call'd
him <HI>Origen,</HI> some <HI>Adamantius,</HI>
which sirname was not given him as some other
of the Fathers had given to them, as Saint <HI>Basil</HI>
for his admirable wit was called <HI>Magnus,</HI> Saint
<HI>Chrysostome</HI> was so called for his sweetnesse of
speech, <HI>Gregorius Nazianzenus</HI> was termed for
his wonderfull knowledge in sacred Writ, <HI>Theo|logus,</HI>
that is, the <HI>Divine.</HI> But <HI>Origen</HI> had this
sirname from his first growth and progresse. The
first of his names was given him for his sublime
and divine speculations, who by sweet and mel|lifluous
<PB N="99" REF="48">
Allegories, carries his Readers affecti|on
from terrene to celestiall contemplations:
his second name he had from the nature of that
precious stone called the <HI>Adamant,</HI> whose lustre
and hardnesse gives it renowme; such was this
Fathers noble and generous minde, not daunted
or affrighted with any afflictions, but in all states
and conditions kept his resolution and integri|tie:
so that as <HI>Erasmus</HI> who wrote his life, speaks
of him, in these words, <HI>Quem nec vit ae austeri|tas,
nec perpetui labores, nec dura paupertas, nec
improborum pravitas, nec suppliciorum terror;
nec ulla mortis facies, &agrave; Sancto instituto vel tan+tillum
dimovere potuit:</HI> that is, whom neither
austerity of life, nor perpetrated labours, nor
dejected poverty, nor wicked mens policies, nor
terrour of punishments, no nor yet death it selfe
could any whit displace or remove: oh admired
patterne to succeeding ages!</P>
<P>There is not much written of his Country,
but most do conclude him to be of <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
because there his Father suffered his imprison|ment,
and Martyrdome, and there left his Wife
and Children, It makes not so much where wee
are borne as of whom: this <HI>Origens</HI> Father and
Grandfather were Christians, though <HI>Porphyrius</HI>
relates that his parents were Heathens: his Fa|thers
name was <HI>Leonidas,</HI> a honest devout man,
and well learned, who after imprisonment lost
his head under the persecution of <HI>Severus</HI> the
Emperour, leaving this <HI>Origen</HI> with sixe other
brethren in great want and penury: for his
<PB N="100" REF="49">
goods and estate were confiscated to the Empe|rour.
Some report this <HI>Leonidas</HI> to have been a
Bishop, as <HI>Eusebius</HI> and Saint <HI>Ierome.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Origen</HI> was very famous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ierom. in Ca|tal. Illust. viro|rum. Euseb. Eccles. Histor. lib. 6.</NOTE> and so little
feared Martyrdome, that had not his mother
prevented his intents, he had made himself a pat|tern
to his Father. For shee in the night got
away his cloathes, so that hee could not goe
abroad: but however while his Father was in
prison, he wrote a worthy Letter to him; not
any wayes to shrinke under the suffering for any
respect; in which he useth this phrase, <HI>Vide pater,
ne quid mea cansa secus facias,</HI> Look to it, oh my
Father, that you do not change your resolution
for my sake: Hee was of that undaunted spirit,
that hee would comfort the Christians in their
Martyrdomes, and would visit others, that were
in chaines for the cause of CHRIST: Nay,
and without feare of punishment delivered
some from their fetters. And in his Writings,
when as he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> speaks of Martyrs, and their tor|ments,
hee seemes to be even ravished in spirit.
Hee was not seventeen yeeres old when hee was
deprived of his Father, and had a Mother with
many brethren, whom hee did by labour and
study maintaine and cherish, and the better to
provide for their sustenance, hee did publikely
professe Grammar, which though many may
take to be a needlesse profession, yet in ancient
times it was in high esteem, so that of it, it was
said, <HI>Senile atque arduum fuisse negotium:</HI> that
is, it was a taske for an old grave man to per|form,
<PB N="101" REF="49">
and full of difficulty, for as a great Writer
speaks, <HI>Non ta~t&ugrave;m expect abatur Declinationum,
Conjugationum &amp; Constructionum ratio: sed
sermonis elegantia, plurimorum Authorum lectio,
Antiquitatum &amp; Historiarum peritia; ac etiam
Poeseos, Rhetorices, Dialectices, Arithmetices, &amp;
Cosmographiae, Musicaeque cognitio,</HI> that is, There
was not onely expected in one of these Profes|sors
a method for the Declensions, Conjugati|ons,
but there was a requisite elegancy of speech,
reading of divers Authours, skill in Histories,
Poetrie, Rhetoricke, Logicke, Arithmeticke,
Cosmographie and Musicke, in all which this
<HI>Origen</HI> was excellently wel experienced; and the
place in which hee professed was no meane one,
but in the famous Citie of <HI>Alexandria:</HI> and pre|sently
after, hee read the grounds of Religion,
divinely instructing the Christians, confirming
and strengthening their hearts against all the
stormes of persecution. Amongst many others
one Disciple called <HI>Plutarchus,</HI> was so encoura|ged
by this famous instrument, that hee under|went
Martyrdome: and one <HI>Heraclas</HI> a Kinsman
of this <HI>Plutarchus,</HI> for his holinesse of life, was
after the death of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> advanced to the
Government of the Church of <HI>Alexandria, Se|renus</HI>
also was so instructed by <HI>Origen,</HI> that hee
died for the name of <HI>Iesus,</HI> as also <HI>Heraclides,</HI>
and many others as well men as women, so ser|vent
and powerfull was the doctrine of <HI>Origen,</HI>
and such deepe impressions made it in the minds
of his Auditors.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="50">
He did strictly keep under his body, and sub|jugated
the flesh to the spirit, lest, as hee said,
while he saved others, hee himselfe should be a
cast-away, he was frequent in watchings, in fast|ings,
humicubations, in labours and wants, and
yet underwent all with a great deale of alacritie,
integritie and patience, his holinesse of life was
not onely admired and followed by Christians,
but also by many Heathens, so attractive and
powerfull is the example of a good life.</P>
<P>But now <HI>Demetrius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
hearing of <HI>Origens</HI> paines and piety, thought
him a fit instrument to be placed in the Church,
and so called him to be the <HI>Catechista,</HI> or Rea|der
of Divinitie in that place, a weighty and
eminent place, which after the Apostles one
<HI>Pantaenus,</HI> and after him one <HI>Clemens</HI> had sup|plyed
in the Citie of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and now this
<HI>Origen</HI> enjoy'd; and kept it many yeeres, with a
general approbation and renowne, the Disciples
of these men were termed <HI>Catechumenists,</HI> or
hearers.</P>
<P>Now he left his profession of <HI>Grammar,</HI> and
sold all his bookes to a friend of his for the al|lowance
of foure half-pence a day, and wholly
addicted himselfe to the studie of Divinity, in
which he so profited and exceld, that hee was by
<HI>Alexander</HI> Bishop of <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> and <HI>Theoctistus</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Caesarea,</HI> called to the Priesthood: a
great dignity in those times, though much and
too much slighted in these looser and propha|ner
days.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="50">
The Churches of <HI>Achaia,</HI> were vext at this
time with divers Heresies, to stop which <HI>Origen</HI>
was sent with the Epistles or Letters Testimo|niall
of the Church, and as he went through <HI>Pa|lestine,</HI>
towards <HI>Athens,</HI> hee was by the Bishops
aforenamed, ordained Priest, that He might be
the more potent, being confirmed by authority
Ecclesiasticall. He did not run, but was lawful|ly
sent, and did painfully undergoe that charge;
and indeed his doctrine and life was so renow|med,
and eminent, that they caused him to be
envied, and hated, especially of <HI>Demetrius;</HI> so
that he did what he could to cloud and darken
this <HI>Origens</HI> fame, (a fault not fitting to harbour
in a Divines breast, though through the Devils
malice too frequent.) This <HI>Demetrius</HI> ript up
this <HI>Origens</HI> faults, and by his writings did pub|lish
them to the World, and especially hee up|braided
him with that rash and inconfiderate
act of his dismembring himself, which He stiles
<HI>puerilis error,</HI> a childish fact, a blind zeale with|out
knowledge, and said, that He took some o|ther
things Historically, which he should not in
the Gospel, as that having two Coats he should
give away one, as also that of not caring for the
morrow, &amp;c. so that what <HI>Origen</HI> thought not
to have bin known, was, and <HI>Demetrius</HI> for that
imperfection, deem'd him unfit for the Priest|hood,
and so did now dislike what formerly hee
approved; and envied deeply him, whom hee
should have lov'd. Such power hath premedita|ted
and working revenge.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="51">
Well, in the height of <HI>Origens</HI> fame, these
things were divulged, and his adversary was
potent, and thereupon <HI>Origen</HI> was forced to
give way to the storme, and yield to the impor|tunitie
of his Enviers, and so left <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
yet always kept his constancie and courage, and
retain'd his piety unmoved, preaching the Go|spel
with all diligence and painfulnesse, striving
to convert many to Christ, not doing as <HI>Ter|tullian</HI>
did, to turn from <HI>Orthodox,</HI> to a <HI>Monta|nist,</HI>
but the more his affliction was, the closer
he kept his piety, nor yet troubling the World
with Schisme, nor yet requiting his adversaries
with ill language, or calumniations, but hee
went another way to worke, to doe good for
evill, and to speak well of His standerers, (as
Saint <HI>Peter</HI> saith) by this meanes stopping the
uthes of his Gain-sayers.</P>
<P>The principall place in which He taught was
<HI>Caesarea</HI> of <HI>Palaestine,</HI> there hee instructed many
in the Faith, and saw the fruits of His labours;
for Hee had many famous men who were His
Followers and Scholers, as <HI>Firmilianus,</HI> after|wards
Bishop of <HI>Caesarea Cappadocia,</HI> of whom
Hee was entertained with applause through all
<HI>Cappadocia.</HI> Who after that he had seen the Holy
places in <HI>Palaestina,</HI> return'd to <HI>Origen</HI> againe.
He brought up <HI>Theodorus,</HI> afterwards called to
the dignity of a Bishop: as also <HI>Gregorius,</HI> who
for the Miracles which Hee wrought, was ter|med
<HI>Thaumaturgus,</HI> who was an eminent Fa|ther
of the <HI>Church.</HI> This <HI>Origen</HI> did likewise
<PB N="105" REF="51">
convert <HI>Anthenodorus</HI> the brother of <HI>Gregorius,</HI>
and made him leave all his worldly wisdome to
gain the knowledge of Christ, and gained great
advancement in the Church of God. He was cal|led
to <HI>Antioch</HI> by <HI>Mamniaea</HI> the mother of <HI>Alex|ander
Severus,</HI> and was by her honourably en|tertained
and religiously dismissed againe, this
woman is called by Saint <HI>Ierome</HI> a Religious
Matron. He wrote a famous and learned Epistle
to <HI>Philip</HI> the Emperour who was the first King
of the <HI>Romans</HI> which was Christian. Hee saw
<HI>Rome</HI> which hee cals <HI>Ecclesiam magnam</HI> a great
Church in one of his Epistles, and this was done
in the time of <HI>Zepherinus:</HI> so againe he did re|turne
to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and admitted into his so|ciety
<HI>Heraclas</HI> again. He recald <HI>Ambrosius</HI> from
the heresie of the Marcionites, and caused him
to embrace the orthodox faith. He never affe|cted
wealth, but contented himselfe with a low
estate; for being so beloved he might easily have
ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">unded in riches, if his mind had beene set|led
on them. He was so studious, that he would
read at his meales. It is said of Him to his cre|dit
and renowme, that, <HI>Origeni null a par <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aetatis
periit &agrave; studiis,</HI> that is, <HI>Origens</HI> whole life was a

him, <HI>Origenis ingenium sufficiebat ad omnia per|discenda:</HI>

shut up all, it is said of Him, <HI>primus omnium

ice, for the explanation of the Scriptures. To
conclude all, Hee carefully employed His
time, endured a great measure of affliction,
faithfully preached the Gospel, converted many

for the good of the Church, In the first yeere

knowne what heavy and cruell torments this
<HI>Origen</HI> then endured, and indeed, it was not so
fierce against any as this Father, for Hee suffered
bonds, tortures of his body, being fastned by
the neck with a great iron chaine, and many
dayes together: his feet were kept in a paire of
Stocks of wood, and then were stretched foure

his tortures;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euseb. lib. Ec|cles. Hist. 6. pag. 173.</NOTE> but what pious Ejaculations
and comfortable prayers, and zealous exhorta|tions
he made and gave to the Christians, is to
be wondred at, considering the length and ex|tremity
of his sufferings, that he should retaine
his valour and constancie, untill the giving up
of his spirit. I know how some have sharply
reprov'd him for that act of dismembring him+selfe,
and others have condemned him and his
Writings; but these are not demonstrations, so
much as calumniations of so great a Light of

<P>_I Doe intend to describe the lives
of foure famous Fathers of this
name, who have beene eminent in
the Church for Piety and Learning,
for Action and Passion, <HI>viz. Gregorius Nazi|anzenus,</HI>
then <HI>Gregory</HI> sirnamed <HI>Magnus,</HI> Pope
of <HI>Rome, Gregory Nyssenus</HI> who was brother to
Saint <HI>Basil</HI> the Great, and this <HI>Gregory Thauma|turgus:</HI>
the greatest part of the Churches Histo|rians
have beene copious in setting forth the
prayses of all these. I now set upon this, and
what I doe expresse to the World shall be true,
and mayntaind by sufficient Witnesses. He was
called <HI>Theodorus</HI> before, and hee got his name
<PB N="111" REF="54">
<HI>Thaumaturgus,</HI> from the abundance of Mira|cles
which hee wrought, and great Wonders
which hee did, if wee give credit to <HI>Gerardus

that Saint <HI>Basil</HI> ranks him not inferiour to <HI>Mo|ses,</HI>
the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apostl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> and that hee was
full of great Signes and Miracles, that hee was
indued with the spirit of prophecie, that hee by
prayer removed a great Hill which hindred the
perfecting of a Church, that hee dried up a great
Lake which had caused great discord betwixt
two Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hren, that Hee by His prayer stopt the
force of the River <HI>Lycus,</HI> which overflowed and
drowned the neighbouring fields, and so bride|led
the swelling waves that ever after they did
keep within their own bounds and banks: That
this Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">her likewise cast out Devils out of the
bodies of men; that He stayed the plague in pla|ces
that were infected, that he heald the sick and
weak, and that He also raised the dead, and that
Hee brought many souls to embrace the Gospel
of <HI>Christ Iesus:</HI> Whether he was so full of these
Works and Wonders, I doe not here intend to
dispute, but I have onely related what I have
read of him, and I have not much cause to su|spect
the wordes of so many Fathers of the
Church, who witnesse it of Him. Take there|fore,
I pray you, the commendation which
Saint <HI>Basil</HI> the great affords Him in His Booke
of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sanctus Basil. in lib. de S. S. cap. 29.</NOTE> Chapter 29.
<GAP DESC="foreign">; that is, Where shall I find
<PB N="112" REF="55">
a fit place for this great <HI>Gregory,</HI> and his praises?
May I not fitly set him with the Prophets and
Apostles, a man endued with the same spirit in
great measure, a man whose life paralled those
former stars of Heaven: a man who did power|fully
shew the vigour of the Word of God. We
should do injury to the Truth, if we should not
account him amongst the blessed in glory and
felicity, which like an eminent Torch shined in
the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Basil. loco citat.</NOTE> <HI>&amp; ope S. S. tremendam

by the helpe of the Holy Ghost, had mighty
power against Devils: Hee had received such a
plentifull portion of the graces of Gods Spirit,
that by the helpe of seventeen more Christians;
he brought whole Cities and Countries to the
obedience of the Gospel. Hee also chang'd the
course, and bridled the force of Rivers: and of
a great Lake which was cause of dissention be|twixt
two brothers: and his predictions of
things to come, makes him that hee may be rec|koned
amongst the Prophets: If saith Saint
<HI>Basil,</HI> I should reckon up all His Wonders and
Miracles, which hee did in the sight of the peo|ple,
I should even attribute that title to him
which his very adversaries afforded him, <GAP DESC="foreign">,

of two Brethren, who fell to civill dissention a|bout
it, so that many men had lost their lives in

God in the sight and hearing of all present; and
<HI>Eusebius</HI> sets down the words of his prayer, <HI>That

Father runs like a Fountain sweetly and calmly,
of an apprehensive, copious, delicious note, and
(that which adds grace to him) of an holy wit:
so that it is hard to distinguish, whether he was
more rich in eloquence, or facile in his explica|tion,
or more powerfull in perswasion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pontius Diaco|nus in vita sancti Cypriani</NOTE> <HI>Pontius</HI>
his Deacon writing of him stiles him thus, <HI>Cy|prianus

Saint <HI>Cyprian,</HI> that Religious Prelate, that Glo|rious
Witnesse and Martyr: to passe by therefore
the part of his life as he was a Rhetorician, wee
will onely describe him as a Christian.</P>
<P>At this first ingresse to Christianitie, he chiefly
studied to keepe his body continent and cleane
from lusts and occasions provoking, saying,
<HI>Tunc enim posse fieri pectus idoneum, &amp; sensum
ad plenam veri capacitatem pervenire; si con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">|piscentiam
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">arnis robusto atque integro sancti|moniae
vigore &amp; rigore calcaret:</HI> That then his
heart would be truly fit, and his spirits to come
to the full capacitie of the truth; if that once he
could with a strong and entire vigour and rigor
of Holinesse trample down his concupiscence of
flesh. And not onely eminent for his austeritie,
but also in the reading of the Scriptures, hee
chiefly aimed how hee might improve his la|bours
to <HI>Gods</HI> glory. Hee at his initiation to
Christianity, gave and distributed all his estate
<PB N="121" REF="59">
to the poore, <HI>ut ambitionem saeculi sperner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t:</HI>
that hee might avoid worldly ambition, and
performe an act of mercy well pleasing to G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d.
A strange thing, and not to be paralleld by any
of the Fathers. Upon this hee entred into the
Priesthood: Where, how worthily hee did be|have
himselfe is manifest, hee was not daunted
with any oppositions, nor frighted with any
persecutions, so that as <HI>Pontius</HI> saith well,
<HI>Non illum penuria, non dolor fregit:</HI> It was not
want or sorrow that startled his noble heart: not
his Wifes disswasions, not the worlds frownes,
not the malice of his adversaries could affright
him. He stood firme &amp; unshaken in all estates and
conditions, keeping his faith and devotion, and
blessed God in his deepest sufferings. His house
was free to all commers, he never turn'd widow
empty away from him, he was the blinde mans
eye, and the lame mans legs, and the naked
mans garment, <HI>Haec debent facere (dicebat) qui
Deo placerent:</HI> These things ought to be done
of such as would please God.</P>
<P>There was one <HI>Caecilius</HI> a Priest and upright
man, who first did enlighten his minde, a man
worth commendation, whom this Saint <HI>Cyprian</HI>
highly honoured and reverenced, calling him
<HI>novae vitae parentem,</HI> The Father of his Chri|stian
life. It is not possible to reckon up all his
severall graces: this adds to his credit, that being
but a <HI>Neophyte</HI> in Christianity, yet God so dispo|sed
it, that hee was chosen to be a Bishop, with
an unconceiveable joy of the people, which did
<PB N="122" REF="60">
honour him, but he was so humble, that hee see|med
not to regard their praises, but at his com|ming
out and going into his house, a World of
Christians attended: <HI>quae illi pietas? qui vigor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">?
misericordia quanta? quanta censura?</HI> O how
great his piety? his valour? O how admirable
his mercy and his discretion! His countenance
full of gravity and pleasantnesse, not too much
expressing a severe sadnesse, nor yet affecting
wantonnesse, but so equally tempered, that it
was hard to say whether hee was more loved or
feared; his carriage was answerable to his aspect,
not any wayes swelling or puft up with pride,
nor dejected with poverty. But what was this
Bishops love to the poore, may be a patterne to
all succeeding ages: but Satan envied this good
man, and so at last he was banished; but even in
this state he performed a world of good. Wit|nesse
that speech made, and sent to <HI>Nemesianus,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oelix,</HI> and <HI>Lucius,</HI> with other Priests and Dea|cons:
saying, <HI>It is no shame but glory, not to be
feared, but to be rejoyced at, to suffer banishment
or paines for Christ; that such as suffer shew
that they are valiant Captains of Vertue, provo|king
by the confessions of their mouth, and suffe|rings
of their bodies, the hearts of the faithfull
to Martyrdome. For, saith he, it is no new thing
for a Christians body to be beaten with clubs, or to
be full of wounds or skars, in as much as they
were ornaments to them not any discouragements
and though the Mines afford no beds to Christians,
yet they shall rest in the Lord: and though their
<PB N="123" REF="60">
weary bodies lie on the cold ground, yet they shall
be refreshed, though their hands and feet have bin
loaden with fetters and chains of iron, yet Christ,
will loose them, and make them free men of Hea|ven,
the tying of them fast here is a meanes to
make them run the faster to Heaven; and though

<P>About this time a grievous pestilence raged
in <HI>Africk,</HI> in which Saint <HI>Cyprian</HI> shewed a
marvellous measure of Piety and Charity: Hee
comforted some, administred to those that were
in want: hee stird up those Christians that were
persecuted by <HI>Pagans,</HI> to afford them neverthe|lesse
reliefe in the time of Contagion, teaching
them to doe good even for evill: but yet not all
these unparalleld patternes could move those
Heathens: for <HI>Valerianus</HI> and <HI>Galienus</HI> Empe|rours,
The Proconsull <HI>Aspatius Paternus</HI> see|ing
of what great authority Saint <HI>Cyprian</HI> was
in <HI>Carthage,</HI> nor yet daring to lay hands on him,
commanded him to depart the City. Wel, Saint
<HI>Cyprian</HI> obeyed his Injunction, and went to <HI>Cu|rubis</HI>
for one yeere, till the Proconsull died,
whom <HI>Galienus Maximus</HI> succeeded, and then
this Father returned; and if the persecution had
not hindred, hee had sold all his Gardens, and
distributed the mony to the poore: He told his
friends the time of his Martyrdome. But this
Proconsul hearing where Saint <HI>Cyprian</HI> lived,
and how the people flocked to him, commanded
him to bee apprehended, and carefully to bee
watched in his owne house: hither came a world
of people, supposing to have seene the Martyr|dome
of this Reverend Father; but he knowing
this purpose of the Proconsul, did prevent him,
for he departed to <HI>Vtica,</HI> and writ an Epistle to
the Christians shewing the cause: well though

but at <HI>Sextum,</HI> six miles distant, so called,
because the sixt great stone from <HI>Carthage</HI> was

he was offered up there, yet there was such an

this Father at the very time of suffering was so
carefull to doe good, as though death had not
beene so neere to him, witnesse his comforts,
that hee gave to Virgins at the same time. Hee
suffered under <HI>Galienus Maximus,</HI> who when
it was told him that the Emperour had com|manded
him to death, answered joyfully doe

him he must lose his head, Saint <HI>Cyprian</HI> answe|red,
<HI>God be thanked for delivering mee from the
bonds of the flesh:</HI> the people that accompanied
him, desired also to suffer with him. When hee
came to the place of Martyrdome, hee put off
his Bishops attire, and gave them to his Dea|cons,
onely reserved one to die in, and wisht
them to give to his Executioner 25 pieces of
Gold in testimony of his love to him. All the
Clergie and his friends wondrously deplored
his death, so that they laid their owne garments
under his body, because none of his bloud
should fall to the ground: hee covered his owne
eyes, and so kneeling down, tooke the blow of
the Executioner quietly, and with all signes of
joy. All the Christians had a great care to see
<PB REF="63">
his body honourably interred, not fearing all
the threats of the Officers, nor Heathens. Hee
was the first of all the Bishops of <HI>Carthage,</HI> that
suffered Martyrdome:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> afterward there were two

the Reigne of <HI>Dioclesian</HI> the Empe|rour,
and professed Rhetorike with
the applause of all men in a certain Citie of <HI>A|frick,</HI>
called <HI>Sicca.</HI> Amongst many other ex|cellent
Scholers to whom he read daily, the most
famous for wit and learning was <HI>Lactantius,</HI>
there are many things which doe greatly set
forth the praise of this <HI>Arnobius,</HI> though many
pens have striven to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ully, or at least to lessen
this mans good name; and to cast aspersions, and
make suspicions of his Writings: for who can
in the first place, but ingenuously confesse
<PB N="133" REF="65">
him to be an able man for learning; how is it
possible else that hee should have brought up o|thers
to that height and excellencie? How could
he otherwise have kept his place with such a ge+nerall
approbation? How could hee have set
forth those worthy Works which are reserved
in the Church with great applause? For where
can there be more solid pieces found then his?
And secondly, his conversion from Heathenisme
to Christianitie, as it was worthy of commenda|tion,
so the more prayse-worthy, because it was
voluntary, sincere and constant: voluntarily
d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ne it was, for there were no threats to terrifie
him; no tormentors to urge him; there were no
men imployed in that service to winne him; nor
yet any preferments (either promised him to al|lure
him, nor any could hee hope for in those
times, and from those persons, that then ruled;
neither did he (by any probability) lay down his
former profession upon any such indirect and
uncertaine foundations: so that without tor|ments
and threatnings; without rewards or
hopes of any he did voluntarily embrace Chri|stian
Religion: an act very rare, to offer up him|selfe
willingly into the Lords Harvest. Then se+condly,
his conversion was sincere, though by
many Bishops not onely suspected; but at first
feared: for when as hee came to them, and did
earnestly desire of them to be received into the
Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixt. Sene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s. loco praedict.</NOTE> and to be baptized, it is said, <HI>quem cum
illi rejicerent, veriti, ne vir saeculari eloq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">entia

illudere vellet:</HI> Whom, they fearing
denied it to him, lest he a man swelling and puft
up with secular wisdome, and who had alwayes
thitherto opposed Christian Religion; should
make both a mock of them and it, whose deal|ing
and proceedings in that kind were wise and
politicke: For it is usuall with great learned
men without the speciall grace of God working
and ruling them, to despise the simplicitie of
Christianity: but yet God brought him in,
worke hee had to be done by his pen, which
should stop the mouthes of the Adversaries of
his Church. And who knows not Gods dealing
with <HI>Saul,</HI> who was sorely against his children,
yet a man in that state and condition wel known
for Learning and able parts, but brought to be
one that was ready to die for the Name of the
Lord Jesus. It makes not what the instrument
hath beene so much as what it is.</P>
<P>But yet <HI>Arnobius</HI> finding this repulse at these
Fathers hands, leaves not his intendments; but
presently produceth his Letters Testimoniall,
sufficient proofe that Hee intended what hee
made profession of. For then <HI>Obtulit eis in Argu|mentum

them those most excellent Volumes of his Di|sputations
against his former <HI>Gentilisme,</HI> as in|fallible
arguments of his sincerity, and to be for
ever the manifest pledges of his Faith: which
were presently with great joy received by them&punc;
<PB N="135" REF="66">
and he received of them the sure seale of Chri|stianitie.</P>
<P>And as his conversion was voluntarily as from
himselfe without any constraint used, as it was
sincere without Hypocrisie, as may be seene by
his Works, so likewise was He in the third place
to his dying day constant in it: For notwith|standing
the hate and envy of his former asso|ciates;
notwithstanding the dangers that Chri|stians
are subject to, and more specially those of
that time, in which Hee lived, being many;
though Hee could not choose but know the
mockes and scoffes that were put upon Christi|ans,
yet none of these could any whit remove
him; or cause him either to be sorry for his act,
or to relinquish the Faith: contrary to the pra|ctice
of too too many <HI>Formalists</HI> and <HI>Tempori|zers;</HI>
who can take up, and lay down Religion
as they do their garments: but our <HI>Arnobius</HI> did
goe on and hold out.</P>
<P>Now thirdly, for his upright life and learned
Writings, they are known to all: though there
be some disputes about the latter, yet, none but
Heathens have spoken against his life: no que|stion
but his life was answerable to his professi|on;
however Charity shall perswade where
none accuses: and hide his blemishes if Hee had
any: and therefore I will a little touch upon the
latter: some cals his Works, <HI>Insignia volumina,</HI>

<HI>Ierome</HI> and divers others have said of him, I

concerning his Commentarie, which Hee hath

<P>When as Hee lived about <HI>Frankendale,</HI> this

much in little: the words, indeed, seemed
somewhat more neglected, but the sense most ample

who writ against the <HI>Gentiles:</HI> For it is certaine,
the same pen writ, though not to the same persons:
Hee writ the one to Scholers learned, this to the
common people, Hee fitted himselfe to the meanest,
that all might understand what all did sing: he
had a care of the weakest; that hee was so short,
it was for m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mory, that he was so plaine, it was for
profit, in both these hee shewed exquisite eloquence
and depth of judgment, as well knowing what he
did. He doth not use any circumlocutions, hee de|sired
rather to give the best, then much and naugh|ty.
His stile is no where languid or dull, he strives
to refresh, to stirre up, to comfort the Reader, for
the learning and sincerity that you shall find, you
may admire him. In briefe, hee hath so done all,

was so famous among all the contemporary Bi|shops
of his age for his knowledge in divine

celebrated with this most noble Eulogie of the
Emperour <HI>Constantine,</HI> who would often say,
<HI>That it was</HI> Eusebius <HI>happinesse to bee worthy to
be Bishop, not onely of one City, but of the whole

an high place! Indeed, mens abilities should be
answerable to their dignities: greatest perfecti|ons
are fittest for greatest places and promoti|ons.
If <HI>Moses</HI> be placed over all the <HI>Israelites</HI> as

but with his employments his measure

He that is <GAP DESC="foreign">, is an Over-seer, and
such had need bee furnished with more then
ordinary gifts, for correcting of vice, instructing

<P>And for his eloquence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Biblioth. sacra pag. 248.</NOTE> Saint <HI>Ierome</HI> stiled
him, <HI>Romani eloquii Tubam,</HI> the Trumpet of
<HI>Roman</HI> elocution. Eloquence in a Minister is a
singular ornament. <HI>Moses</HI> was fearfull to take
up Gods Embassage, not being eloquent, but
slow of speech: therefore God appointeth his

<P>That he was a defender of the <HI>Arrian</HI> He|resie,

some Writers affirme, either deceived by the

and afterward at <HI>Nicomedia</HI> in <HI>Bythinia,</HI> Cap|tain

because <HI>Eusebius</HI> of <HI>Caesarea,</HI> would
not consent in the <HI>Nicene</HI> Councell to the pro|pounders
of the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, or Consubstan|tiall;
but after a long inquisition and exami|nation
of the said word, done by him not ma|liciously;
but rather out of sincere <HI>pietie;</HI> for
when many of the Bishops would have the
word <HI>Homousii,</HI> as excluding a multitude of
gods, inducted by <HI>Arrius,</HI> and most of the
Bishops did sharply oppose the acception of
the same word, as introducing the opinion of
<HI>Sabellius,</HI> who held that the Father, Sonne,
and Holy Ghost were but one person; through
their diversitie of opinions: <HI>Eusebius</HI> being
doubtfull to whether part hee should assent:
<HI>Eustathius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Antioch,</HI> accused after|ward
by <HI>Cyrus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Bexoen,</HI> opprobrious|ly
termed him a Favourer of the <HI>Arrians,</HI> and a
<PB N="142" REF="70">
corrupter of the <HI>Nicen</HI> Faith. <HI>Eusebius</HI> on the
con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rary, affirmed, that hee neither favoured
<HI>Arius,</HI> nor corrupted the <HI>Nicen</HI> Faith; but that
<HI>Eustathius</HI> did introduce the perfidious opini|on
of <HI>Sabellius:</HI> Lastly, when it was declared
by the Fathers, that this word <HI>Homousii</HI> did not
take away the distinction of persons, which
were of the same Nature and Essence, hee sub|scribed
to the Decree of the <HI>Homousii,</HI> or Con|substantialls,
and by the Fathers command hee
composed that <HI>Nicene</HI> Creed, which is now
sung in the Church.</P>
<P>A singular stayed discretion in a man of au|thority
and eminent dignity, not rashly to suf|fer
any noveltie to creep into the Church with|out
examination, how farre forth it may prove
profitable to the good of the Church; especial|ly
in matters of greatest importance, such as
this, concerning the Deity's essence, and man|ner
of existence, which is well distinguished by
the Schoolmen: every person in the Deity (say
they) is <HI>alius &amp; alius, sed non aliud &amp; aliud:</HI>
the former notes the distinction of persons, but
the later their essence to be the same and undi|vided:
such as the Father is, such is the Sonne,
and such is the Holy Ghost.</P>

<P>And the difference of the Law and Gospell

begun against the Christians (as <HI>Eusebius</HI>
relates it) in the nineteenth yeere of <HI>Dioclesian,</HI>
in which there was cruell demolition of Chur|ches
and sacred Temples, burning of holy and
godly Books, inhumane tortures and torments
inflicted against the Christians; so that, where
any were found that were pious and Christian,
they were fetcht and most severely martyred
for the truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baron. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nno 302. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">um. 16.</NOTE> as Cardinall <HI>Baronius</HI> averres: and
indeed all other Ecclesiasticall Historians, that
though the Tempest raged horribly, yet this
worthy constant Father retain'd his piety, and
feared not any Tormentors, but resolv'd both
in life and death to keepe his stedfast faith in the
merits and mercies of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Behold, in this <HI>Lactantius</HI> a true patterne of
a true follower of Jesus, who despaired not in
the depth of his penury, and poverty, nor yet
was daunted or struck off from Heaven by the
rage of persecution: these two I dare boldly say
have made many to deny their Lord that so
dearly bought them, with the price of his most
precious bloud.</P>
<P>To bee poore by nature is no shame unto a
man; for we brought nothing into this world
with us; nor must we carry any thing out of it;
but to be made poore by any evill or unhappy
occasion of our own, that we ought to be asha|med
<PB N="156" REF="77">
of and hate: And there is one thing only
for which poverty ought to be beloved: because
that maketh triall and shew of whom thou art
beloved; for who was poorer on earth then
Christ, which died for us; for he had no where
to repose or lay his head.</P>
<P>But this furious Thunderclap removed not
this stout <HI>Lactantius,</HI> but as his name, so his na|ture
was firme and fixed: his education under
such a stout Master, was a great motive to him
to stand fast, for <HI>Arnobius</HI> (whose Disciple this
<HI>Lactantius</HI> was) did, to testifie to the World
his constancie in <HI>Religion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">. de scrip. Eccles. p. 45.</NOTE> even in the Reigne
of <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> set forth seven Books against the
Heathens (as <HI>Bellarmine</HI> avers) by which and his
Masters example, <HI>Lactantius</HI> learn'd to imitate
so noble a vertue. It is none of the least testimo|nies
of a pious mind to be spurred on to follow
good examples. And it is a thing very unfit
and inconvenient for any man to carry goodnes
in his mouth, and have none at his heart.</P>
<P>I cannot omit to mention likewise thus much
of him, that when as with much profit and
commendation Hee had learn'd of <HI>Arnobius,</HI>
(that being sheltered by some friends to the
Gospell of Christ during the time of persecu|tion)
as I am perswaded not without the singu|lar
providence of God, ordering it for the pre|servation
of this man, that hee was in his old
age (as I have said before) upon severall proofs,
called to instruct <HI>Crispus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ron. in scrip. Eccles. in Lactantio.</NOTE> the sonne of <HI>Constan|tinus:</HI>
as Saint <HI>Ierome, Ruffin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> and Socrates:
<PB N="157" REF="77">
doe witnesse: any man of judgement, I suppose,
will conclude that such a wise, religious, potent,
and munificent Emperour as <HI>Constantine</HI> would
never have taken such speciall notice and know|ledge
of a decrepit old man; had he not certain|ly
been informed of, or really knowne the wor|thy
parts and pious endowments of this Reve|rend
<HI>Lactantius:</HI> neither could hee have beene
admitted into the Emperours favour, had hee
not beene formerly well approved by the Fa|thers
of the Church; and had of them Letters
Testimoniall and Commendatory for his inte|gritie
and learning; nay, unlesse he had been well
furnished with learning and gravity, holinesse
of life: <HI>Constantine</HI> would not have committed
the Education of his sonne unto him: Good
<HI>Education</HI> being the manifest pillar of Nobility
and Greatnesse, and indeed good and able <HI>Tu|tors</HI>
are necessarily requisite about the persons
of Princes. <HI>Education,</HI> indeed, alters the whole
course of Nature; Hence it is said, that an ill
man by due ordering and good governance, is
made good, as a piece of ground which is full of
weeds, may by a skilfull and diligent hand be
cleere and fruitfull to bring forth fruit. So a
minde that is full of vices and corruption may
by good discipline be made honest and vertu|ous.
<HI>Education,</HI> saith one, is compared to a
Sickle and a Hand; and being demanded the
reason, made this answer: that if there was any
vice in the soule, it would weed it out, and if
there was no vertue as yet in the soule, it would
<PB N="158" REF="78">
plant some in. These things aforesaid, seriously
considered, doe not a little set forth the lustre
and glory of our <HI>Lactantius:</HI> and to adde this
one thing to what hath been said, all the Histo|rians
do not mention any thing of his remove|all
from his great charge, but by all probabilitie
he continued his place with repute, and a gene|rall
approbation as well of the Emperour as of
his sonne. For his carriage in the place, or how
long hee continued it, nor Saint <HI>Ierome,</HI> nor
<HI>Eusebius, Ruffinus,</HI> nor <HI>Nicephorus,</HI> nor <HI>Bellar|mine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hieron. in scri|ptis Eccles. in Lactantio.</NOTE>
or <HI>Baronius</HI> do once mention: and there|fore
we may safely suppose that <HI>Lactantius</HI> was
upright and vertuous. If we may give credit to
Saint <HI>Ierome,</HI> this Father also was an industrious
man for his Writings, of which there were ma|ny
penned that are not now extant. And wee
may believe that though the Author did escape
the great persecution, yet many of his works
perished in the flames, when as the enemies of
the Church did not spare to burne the Word of
God; and of those that are extant, Cardinall
<HI>Bellarmine</HI> hath censured some of them to be
none of <HI>Lactantius.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bell. de scrip. Eccles. p. 46.</NOTE> Especially the Verses, and

what a learned man he was, in his <HI>Treatise

I commend vertue it selfe, for it is all one

vertue in all workes is chiefly, and above all
things to be praysed, as the head fountaine, our
most precious Jewell, of all manner of riches:
Vertue is said to be a strong Castle that can ne|ver
be won; it is a river that needeth no row|ing;
a Sea that moveth not, a fire that quench|eth
not; a treasure that ever hath an end; an
army never overcome; a burden that never wea|rieth:
a spie that ever returneth, a signe that
never deceiveth; a plain way that never faileth;
a sirrope that forthwith healeth, a renowne that
never perisheth: it is onely vertue which attai|neth
everlasting blessednesse: all these appeare at

had no more Children but this one <HI>Athanasius</HI>
who did not degenerate from their worth, but
added lustre and glory to his progenitors; his
spring shewed what a rich harvest he would
produce. For even in his young yeares hee was
Ingenious, liberally disposed, of upright cariage,
obedient to his parents. Hee is of all Writers
famous for his actions, even in his youth especi|ally
for one which I cannot omit: when <HI>Alexan|der</HI>
the Bishop of that City did yeerely cele|brate
a great Feast in memory of <HI>Peter</HI> the Mar|tyr;
which had beene formerly Bishop in the
same place: he having his house by the waterside
saw many youths playing together (now the
manner of their sport was that all the boyes
should personate Priests and Deacons) and so
they all consented and cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e this <HI>Athanasius</HI> to
be their Bishop, and so they presented unto this
<HI>Athanasius,</HI> some other youths which were not
yet baptiz'd, that they might be baptized by him:
so <HI>Athanasius</HI> performing all things requisite,
baptized them with the water of the sea, and
gave them good counsels and admonitions,
directing them what to doe hereafter, which the
Bishop of <HI>Alexandria</HI> beholding and wondring
at their actions, caused them to be brought to
him, whom when he had asked many questions,
being certified of the act, would not have the
children to be rebaptized, and gave order forth|with
that <HI>Athanasius</HI> parents should be brought
to him; to whom he gave strict charge that they
should see him brought up to Learning, which
<PB N="165" REF="81">
they performed. So this <HI>Athanasius</HI> profiting ex|ceedingly
in all sorts of learning, he was as an
other <HI>Samuel</HI> to the old Bishop, <HI>Alexander:</HI>
who at first used him to read to him, and write
from him: then he was ordained Deacon, and
so received the order of Priesthood: about what
time <HI>Arrius</HI> began to broach his too too infe|ctious
Heresie, about which there was some pri|va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e

before the <HI>Nicene</HI> Councell: in which this <HI>A|thanasius</HI>
shewed himselfe a maine opponent,

<P>Whereupon the old Bishop <HI>Alexander</HI> going
to the Councell at <HI>Nice,</HI> tooke this <HI>Athanasius</HI>
with him, not onely as his companion in his

writ sharpe and reprehensive Letters to

that unlesse he would receive him, that hee
would presently send such to him, that should
not onely strip him of his Bishoprick, but also
cast him out of the Citie of <HI>Alexandria:</HI> but
hee withstood this storme, and sent Letters to
<HI>Constantine,</HI> declaring the reasons why <HI>Arrius</HI>
could not nor might not be entertained: Then
his Adversaries failing here, stirred other ca|lumnies
against him by wicked instruments <HI>Me|letians.</HI>
For they politickly divulged it, that
<HI>Athanasius</HI> should exact new customes, and im|pose
new burthens upon the Churches in <HI>Egypt,</HI>
and that hee intended evill against <HI>Constantine</HI>
the Emperour: but being sent for to <HI>Constanti|nople</HI>
by the Emperour, hee made his innocen|cie
appeare to the Emperour, so that the Em|perour
honoured him highly, and sent him back
to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> with Letters Certificatory, that
all what was objected against him was false, and
gave him this commendatory title, <HI>Virum plan&egrave;
Divinum existimo.</HI> I hold him a sincerely Di|vine

of him.</P>
<P>But these Devillish instruments left not pro|secuting

and that he had out off the hand of one

but all these engines fail'd, for <HI>Constantine</HI>

yet he also stil hearing new accusations and con|tinuall

out of anger, or being overcome with the
policies of <HI>Athanasius</HI> adversaries, or whether
in hope this <HI>Athanasius</HI> being removed, his ac|cusers
would cease, or whether to safeguard this
good Bishop from violence, he consented to ba|nish
this <HI>Athanasius</HI> to <HI>Treveire</HI> in <HI>Gaule,</HI> which
indeed gave scope to <HI>Arrius</HI> his admittance to
new favours, and liberty the more to settle and
spread his poysonous Heresie: which those of

good man desired of God in the Temple, either
to take him out of this miserable life, or else by

that the next day, <HI>Arrius</HI> going with great
ostentation, with a great number of followers,
to a publike meeting, sitting in <HI>Latrin&acirc;,</HI> was
senslesse (and mad as it were) and voided out a

friend, as <HI>Abdias,</HI> in former time did the Lords
Prophets: yet at last a Maid servant made it
known to his Adversaries: but <HI>Athanasius</HI> was
sent away that very night before the searchers
came, by the goodnesse of God; and so con|veyed
<PB N="171" REF="84">
himselfe into the West; where <HI>Constans</HI>
after the death of <HI>Constantine</HI> the younger
raigned: hereby the help of <HI>Iulius</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI>
Bishop, he got a little breathing: but it was con|cluded
at <HI>Sardis,</HI> that the <HI>Nicen</HI> Faith was right,
and that they who did defend contrary, were
not fit to bee admitted amongst the faithfull.
The Decree of that Synod is to bee read in
<HI>Theodoret.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this grew the Division of the Eastern
and Westerne Churches, and this was it that
made the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> to flourish; but the
Easterne Churches were divided into three
parts. There were first <HI>Arrians</HI> and <HI>Eusebians,</HI>
then the <HI>Aetians</HI> and <HI>Eunomians,</HI> and lastly, the
<HI>Macedonians:</HI> by these three the Churches were
miserably vexed.</P>
<P>But foure yeeres after the Councell of <HI>Sardis</HI>
even to the death of <HI>Constantius</HI> some ten
yeeres space: this <HI>Athanasius</HI> was again banish|ed
into the Desarts of <HI>Libya;</HI> but the Emperour
was sorely vexed at him: but <HI>Liberius</HI> then Bi|shop
of <HI>Rome,</HI> pleaded hard for him, in so much
that <HI>Constantius</HI> banished him for it: well in the
absence of <HI>Athanasius, Constantius</HI> caused coun|cels
to be held in severall places, that was chiefe
against <HI>Photinus</HI> the Heretike, who dispraised
both the <HI>Orthodoxe</HI> and <HI>Arrians.</HI> Against this
<HI>Photinus,</HI> both the <HI>Orthodoxe</HI> Christians and <HI>Ar|rians</HI>
agreed well.</P>
<P>But in what troubles was the Church under
the Reigne of <HI>Constantius,</HI> who gouerned 24
<PB N="172" REF="85">
yeers, in which space there were so many Coun|cels,
and nine contrary Confessions of Faith to
that of the <HI>Nicene</HI> Councell; the two first were
proposed at <HI>Antioch,</HI> the third by <HI>Constantius</HI>
his Embassadours to <HI>Constans:</HI> the fourth was
sent by <HI>Eudoxius,</HI> to the Westerne Bishops: the
fifth, sixth and seventh was at <HI>Sirmium,</HI> the
eighth at <HI>Seleucia</HI> by the <HI>Acacians,</HI> the ninth
was at <HI>Constantinople:</HI> to which <HI>Vlphilas</HI>
the Bishop of the <HI>Gothes</HI> subscribed: upon
all these hath <HI>Athanasius</HI> divinely spoken.</P>
<P>Witnesse his Creed, every syllable whereof
beares matter of importance answerable to the
judgment of so divine an Author: whose do|ctrine
in other things was no lesse judicious,
though not altogether so profitable, as in this
his compendious abridgment, and abbreviation
of the Christian faith briefly comprehended in a
short Epitome, yet not so briefely as plainly
dilucidated and expounded to the general bene|fit
and edification of the Church. Concerning
which it may be said, <HI>maximum in minimo,</HI> that
the greatest thing is in the least, the most matter
in fewest words. And albeit in the Apostles
Creed there are not many words, yet the words
might appeare unto some not sufficient for re|strayning
Heretikes from their opinions; and
hence this Father advisedly undertooke the
penning of this his Creed, for explication of
those articles which others wrested and perver|ted
to their own and others destruction: which
had it bin sooner written, in all probability those
<PB N="172" REF="86">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="173" REF="87">
their errors had bin nipped in the bud, &amp; never
germinated to the scandal and annoyance of the
Church of God. So that as it is said of the good
woman by the Son of <HI>Syrach, Many daughters
have done vertuously, but thou excellest them all:</HI>
so may we say of this learned and reverend man,
many have written <HI>Creeds</HI> of the Christian faith,
but thine (the Apostles onely excepted) is infe|riour
unto none, yea, superiour being compared
with others.</P>
<P>Upon these occurrences, <HI>Constantius</HI> died,
sorrowing for three reasons: The first, that hee
had furthered his Kindreds death; the second,
because hee had nominated <HI>Iulian</HI> the Apostate
Emperour: the third, that he had too much ap|proved
those new and Hereticall <HI>Arrian</HI> points.</P>
<P>But now the case of the Church under <HI>Iulian</HI>
was deplorable, who strive to put downe all
Christianity: But for all this, <HI>Athanasius</HI> receives
his charge at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> where while he staid,
he called the Bishops together, and they streng|thened
the <HI>Nicene</HI> Confession: and they con|demned
the <HI>Arrians, Eunomians, Macedonians,</HI>
and the <HI>Audaeans,</HI> and <HI>Apollinarians</HI> with the
<HI>Sabellians:</HI> but now the Church increasing at
<HI>Alexandria,</HI> by <HI>Athanasius</HI> presence, the great
Philosophers, Magicians, Wisards, and South-sayers,
cry out, that they can do nothing, unlesse
this <HI>Athanasius</HI> be removed: So Letters were
granted not onely to take him, but to kill him:
upon this <HI>Athanasius</HI> leaves <HI>Alexandria</HI> and in|tends
to go by ship to <HI>Thebais:</HI> his friends grie|ving
<PB N="174" REF="88">
at his departure, he told them, <HI>Nubecula est
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ito transitura:</HI> It was a cloud that would soone
be over, and so it came to passe: for the yeere
after, <HI>Iulian</HI> died fearfully: but how ever, he
sent after <HI>Athanasius</HI> to apprehend him; but they
were deceived that sought him, for hee came
presently back to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and kept close till
<HI>Iulian</HI> was dead. Then <HI>Iovianus</HI> succeeding
in the Empire, recall'd the banished Orthodox
Bishops, and embrac'd them highly; <HI>Athana|sius</HI>
writ an Epistle to this 'Emperour of the <HI>Ni|cene</HI>
Faith: but this good <HI>Iovianus</HI> after seven
moneths raigne died at <HI>Bythinia;</HI> so <HI>Valenti|nianus</HI>
and <HI>Valens</HI> succeeded him: different
these were, for <HI>Valentinian</HI> was Orthodoxe, but
<HI>Valens</HI> was an <HI>Arrian;</HI> and did persecute the
Easterne Churches; so that <HI>Athanasius</HI> was for|ced
to hide himselfe in his Fathers Monument,
the space of foure moneths: yet for all this stir,
this Emperour was in a manner forc't to give
leave to <HI>Athanasius</HI> to reside in <HI>Alexandria:</HI> so
long as this <HI>Athanasius</HI> liv'd, the Church of <HI>A|lexandria</HI>
was quiet: but this good Father died
in the seventh yeere of <HI>Valens</HI> his Raigne, peace|ably,
and in his old age, having been Bishop 46
yeeres of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> This Father is commen|ded
of all Ecclesiasticall Writers. <HI>Gregory Na|zianzen</HI>
stiles him, <HI>Tubam ingentem &amp; colum|nam
Ecclesiae:</HI> The great Trumpet of the
Church, and the Churches Pillar: and further

and spirituall graces, wherewith he

lived a strictaustere life, shunning the con|versation
of <HI>Iewes</HI> and <HI>Hereticks.</HI> Herein hee
shewed himself a true Christian, whose practice
must be answerable to his profession; for other|wise
a man may be said to beare fire in one hand,
and water in another: whatsoever a man pro|fesseth,
except he put what he professeth in pra|ctice,
there is a shadow without substance, a tree
without fruit; whose leaves of profession will
not keep it from being cut downe and cast into
the fire. No such tree was Saint <HI>Hilary,</HI> but the
Psalmists tree, which brought forth his fruit in
due season.</P>
<P>O most perfect man, whose life was with love
to feare, and with feare to love Christ.</P>
<P>Hee preached often to informe the people of
the <HI>mysterie</HI> of the <HI>Trinitie,</HI> sowing the words
of truth on the ground of their hearts.</P>
<P>In this he was a faithfull Minister of Christ:
he did feed Christs sheep, aswell as cloath him|selfe
with the wooll: and how did he feed them?
<HI>pavit verbo, pavit exemplo,</HI> by doctrine, and ex|ample:
his example availed to the teaching of
the ignorant; his doctrine for information of
the judgement, both of learned and unlearned.</P>
<P>This his pious zeale being knowne, hee was
elected <HI>Priest,</HI> and his fame spread abroad
through <HI>France,</HI> and forraine <HI>Countries.</HI> After|wards
<PB N="182" REF="91">
he resisted and opposed the <HI>Arrian</HI> Here|sie;
whereupon the Bishops <HI>Valens</HI> and <HI>Vrsatius;</HI>
perswaded the Emperour to banish Saint <HI>Hilary</HI>
into <HI>Phrygia,</HI> together with <HI>Dionysius</HI> Bishop
of <HI>Millain,</HI> and <HI>Eusebius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Vercels.</HI></P>
<P>And it is observable, <HI>That wheresoever God
hath his Church, the Devill hath his Chappell;</HI> and
where the Husbandman sowes wheat, there the
enemy sowes tares. As the truth of God was
propagated, so the tares grew up among the
wheat: and not onely so, but the tares w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uld
overgrow the wheat, and not suffer it to grow
up with them.</P>
<P>During his banishment, hee understood that
his Daughter <HI>Abra</HI> left at <HI>Poicters</HI> with her
mother, was sought in Marriage by a wealthy
proper young man; whereupon he wrote a Let|ter
to his Daughter that hee had provided her a
Husband of great Nobilitie, and of such ad|mirable
beauty, that it exceeded the amiable
colours of the <HI>Rose</HI> and <HI>Lilly;</HI> admonishing
therefore not to match her selfe to any one un|till
he returned, and that till then she should ex|pect
the comming of this promised Bride|groome.
Whereupon his Daughter <HI>Abra,</HI>
mildly embracing her Fathers counsaile, remay|ned
unmarried.</P>
<P>A notable example of an obedient childe in
a matter of greatest consequence. Shee did not
so much satisfie her fancie, as magnifie her un|derstanding
in receiving her Fathers advice.
Which should other children doe, they might
<PB N="183" REF="91">
please God better in obeying his Commande|ment;
and their Parents, who <HI>lege talionis,</HI> de|serve
more respect then their children can give
them.</P>
<P>Many Bishops by the Emperours command,
being assembled at <HI>Sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ucia,</HI> to give their opini|ons
concerning the <HI>Arrian</HI> Heresie: Saint <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lary</HI>
comming on a Sunday into a Chappell belong|ing
to a Castle; <HI>Florentia</HI> a Heathen Maid cry'd
cut with a loud voice, <HI>That a servant of God was
come thither;</HI> and falling downe at his feet, shee
earnestly desired his <HI>benediction;</HI> and afterward
leaving her parents, shee followed him even to
<HI>Poicters;</HI> saying, <HI>That though hee were not the
father of her generation, yet he was the Father of
her regeneration.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is an easie thing with God <HI>of the stones
to raise up Children unto Abraham;</HI> to mollifie
stony hearts, and make them fructifie, and be|yond
all mans beliefe, by small or no meanes to
bring great things to passe, no lesse then an Hea|thens
Conversion, at the sight and approach of
a man of God. Such is the freenesse of Gods
grace, which is <HI>agens liberrimum.</HI> The Winde
bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the
sound thereof, but knowest no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> whence it com|meth,
nor whither it goeth; even so is every
one that is borne of the Spirit.</P>
<P>Hee got much credit and approbation in the
<HI>Arrian</HI> Synod; and by persecution of his ene|mies,
<HI>Valens</HI> and <HI>Vrsatius,</HI> was sent back againe
into <HI>France;</HI> where Saint <HI>Martin</HI> met him;
<PB N="184" REF="92">
seeking his acquaintance, and adoring him as
an earthly Deity. Afterward Saint <HI>Hilary</HI> being
come home, and finding his Daughter to whom
he had written a former Epistle, constant in de|siring
to be married to the Bridegroome which
her Father had provided; shee returned unto
Christ the Bridegroome of her soule, whose bo|dy
her Father with his owne hands buried; <HI>O
glorious Funerall better than life, being translated
from Earth to Heaven, and that in the flowre of
her age and spring of her youth:</HI> Thus despising
naturall affection, hee shewed loves perfection,
in seeking her eternall felicity and glorifica|tion.</P>
<P>An History which sets forth to the life the
reward of obedient Children: She that obeyed
her earthly father, is rewarded by God her hea+venly
Father: And whereas she did expect for a
recompence of her patience an earthly Bride|groome,
she was espoused to the Bridegroome
of her soule, fairer than the sons of Men, richer
than the greatest Potentates, whose are all the
Beasts of the Mountaines, and the Cattell on a
thousand Hills; sweeter than all sweetnesse, and
better than all goodnesse.</P>
<P>Within few yeeres after, Saint <HI>Hilary</HI> depar|ted
this present life in the Reigne of the Empe|rours
<HI>Valens</HI> and <HI>Valentian,</HI> Earth deploring,
Heaven rejoycing, and also our Saviour Jesus
Christ admitting him into felicitie, to whose
glory he had lived and died.</P>
<P>Thus a blessed Life was seconded by a blessed
<PB N="185" REF="92">
Death; and he that had seene the various chan|ges
in the revolutions of times, did at last ex|change
<GAP DESC="foreign"> drosse for gold, misery

wicked. Can a <HI>Blackamoore</HI> change his skin,
(saith the Prophet) or the <HI>Leopard</HI> his spots?
no more can yee that are accustomed to evill

ancient Proverbe is manifest, that Custome is a
second Nature: for as slips of trees that are in|grafted,

<P>_BEfore the passages of this Fathers
Life shall bee treated of, 'twill not
be amisse to discover two things:
the first the time in which this St.
<HI>Cyrill</HI> lived;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bell. de script. Ecclesiast.</NOTE> for <HI>Bellarmine</HI> placeth
him in the yeare 365: his words are, <HI>Sanctus
Cyrillus Hierosolymae Episcopus, &amp;c.</HI> St. <HI>Cyrill</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> under <HI>Constantius,</HI> often
cast out of his place, by the fury of the <HI>Arrian</HI>
faction, but restored, and at last dyed under
<HI>Theodosius.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Surius in vit is Sanct.</NOTE> But <HI>Surius</HI> puts him in the yeare of
our Lord 340. Now the difference is not to be
accounted so great, the one accounting from
his birth till hee began to be esteemed of in the
<PB N="195" REF="97">
Church, and the other reckoning from the time
of his being first Bishop, to the time of his
Death. The other is, the distinguishing this St.
<HI>Cyrill</HI> from the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and al|so
from another St. <HI>Cyrill Deacon</HI> and <HI>Martyr;</HI>
which is thus to be knowne; first, he is knowne
from St. <HI>Cyrill</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> because this was
but a Confessor, that of <HI>Alexandria</HI> a Martyr;
so also was that St. <HI>Cyrill</HI> which was a <HI>Deacon:</HI>
then also by their difference of Times; this of
<HI>Ierusalem</HI> being in the yeare 365, the other in
430. But St. <HI>Cyrill</HI> the <HI>Deacon</HI> was in the same
time with this worthy instrument: yet they are
easily distinguished; for this Saint was Bishop of
<HI>Ierusalem,</HI> the other did defend the faith in <HI>Phae|nicia,</HI>
in <HI>Heliopolis,</HI> whose Martyrdome (as
<HI>Theodoret</HI> in his <HI>Ecclesiasticall</HI> Historie relates
it) was no lesse famous than Cruell, perpetra|ted
by the <HI>Gentiles</HI> under <HI>Constantine</HI> the Em|perour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theod. Eccles. Histor. l. 3. c. 6.</NOTE>
for in that this St. <HI>Cyrill</HI> did breake
some of their Idols and Images, they not onely
killed him, but ript up his belly, and eate his
Liver; upon whom God did speedily manifest
a terrible revenge: for the Teeth first, and then
the Tongues of all that tasted his Entrailes
fell out, putrid and fetide, then their Eyes; and
so all presently miserably dyed. Now this St.
<HI>Cyril</HI> though he had divers bloudy &amp; malicious
Enemies who would, if they durst, have acted
as much upon him; yet he was by the all-ruling
<HI>Providence,</HI> and protection of <HI>God,</HI> preserved
from their fury.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="98">

proceed to write the actions of this worthy

<HI>Maximus,</HI> who was Patriarch in the same Me|tropolis:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex Rom. Martyrol.</NOTE>

often forced to forsake his place:</Q> and yet af|ter
all these storms, raised by the Devils agents,
he slept quietly in the Lord. Of whose undefi|led

(as saith the Canon) <HI>and also waged many
famous Combats with his Adversaries the</HI> Arri|ans,
<HI>with admirable successe and renowne.</HI> He is
said to have governed the Church singularly
well, and it is knowne that he got the hatred of
many for his great Charity and Compassion to|wards
the poore, for this made him famous
<PB N="197" REF="98">
and envyed; for in the time of a great famine,
when as the poore were destitute of all helpes,
and meanes, and knew not where to finde re|liefe,
they flocked all to this holy Patriarch, as
to their utmost refuge: Hee was so liberall to
them, that he gave them all he had: nay, so full
of pitty and compassion was this Father, that
when he had nothing left him of his owne, hee
tooke the Vessells and Church ornaments, and
sold them to relieve the necessity of the indi|gent;
so that hee feared not to spoyle the
<HI>Temples Materiall,</HI> so that the <HI>Temples Spirituall</HI>
might be furnished, imitating in this his acti|on,
the examples of St. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> St. <HI>Augustine,</HI>
and others; and even for this act he wanted not
many adversaries: yet for all their proceedings
he justified the act, and was beloved of all pious
and good men.</P>
<P><HI>Nicephorus</HI> saies of this Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Niceph. l. 9. c. 14. Eccles&punc; hist.</NOTE> that <HI>inter

to be disbursed out of the common stocke, St.

and though all the fowles of Heaven came and
eat of the fruit, yet still there remayned a great
quantity: this as they verily judged, shewed how
his doctrine of the true Vine <HI>Iesus Christ</HI> should
be so copious and delicate, that all Nations in all
ages, might out of his Works gather nourish|ment,
and yet there would be store enough for
others that should come after: and certain it is,
that this man had admirable endowments,
whom all the worthy Fathers of the Church

none but such as be ignorant of great <HI>Saint Ba|sil,</HI>

witnesseth they were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idem ibid.</NOTE> <HI>Actio &amp; Contemplatio;

strict <HI>Mortifications,</HI> privacie of life, dili|gence

instant in preaching, no lodging but the cold
earth, an incredible austeritie of life, poverty
with singular Humility, mercifull in a manner
beyond humane condition, opposing, and in|deed
not enduring the Broachers of Heresies:
in a word, furnished with all the gracious en|dowments
that should bee in the man of God;
how zealously did He in His Writings by sun|dry
places of <HI>Scripture,</HI> and severall undeniable
arguments detest those furious and mischiefe
working Hereticks, as <HI>Sabellius, Arrius, Apol|linarius,
Anomius, Novatus,</HI> and others: in so
much that He was stiled the <HI>Pancratiastes,</HI> or the
unconquered Souldier of <HI>Iesus Christ:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Nyssen. in vita S. Eph.</NOTE> For his
great love to <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>Neighbours,</HI> the words
of his own will, do sufficiently declare, which
deserve to be engraven in Golden Characters;
<HI>Nullo modo in tota mea vita contra Deum contu|meliosus
<PB N="209" REF="104">
extiti, nec sermo stultus &egrave; labiis meis
egressus est: Neminem in tota vita maledict is
onerari; nec cum ullo&punc; Christiano homine conten|tiosum
me praebus:</HI> that is, By no means in all
my life (saith hee) have I reproached God, or
suffered foolish words to flie out of my mouth,
never did I burthen any man with curses, nor
did I ever shew my selfe contentious with any:
so that it doth plainly appeare, what circum|spection
hee had over his wayes: Hee was won|drous
studious in the Word of God; and made
divers very comfortable and learned Commen|taries;
and he was wonderfull eloquent to per|swade
men to embrace the Word of God; hee
kept his bodie and minde chaste and pure; as
doth appeare by repelling the shamelesse beha|viour
of a lewd woman, which being instigated
by the Devill, thought to have entic'd him to
lust: but this grave Father, what with his ex|hortations,
admonitions, and divine speeches,
caught and overcame the Tempter; so that shee,
which had beene light of behaviour by his fa|therlike
advise, prov'd a grave, modest, religious
Matron; He would very often weep for and be|waile
the calamities of men, the losse of time,
his inbred corruptions. Hee that reads but that
one Tract of his of <HI>Humilitie</HI> seriously; will (if
endued with any sparke of grace) remove all
pride and self-conceit, and will with that King,
and this Father confesse, <HI>That hee is a worme,
and no man,</HI> corrupted with sinne and ini|quitie.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="105">
Indeed, <HI>Humility</HI> for her excellency should be
the sister of true <HI>Nobility:</HI> for God hath more
respect unto them that with humblenesse of
heart, can cast themselves lowly before the pre|sence
of his Majesty. For as the lowlinesse of
heart, maketh man highly in favour with God:
even so meeknesse of words, maketh him to
sinke into the hearts of men; such was this our
<HI>Ephraems</HI> condition of <HI>humilitie.</HI></P>
<P>Who shall read his booke of <HI>Divine Love,</HI>
whose heart will not be inflamed? For the grea|test
argument of godly love is to love that
which God willeth and commandeth: and con|trariwise
not to love that which God loveth
not: And the true lover of God, (which is pro|perly
the charitable person) is under no rule; but
he is Lord above all inventions, all precepts, and
all commandements, that God hath given to
man: for love is not confined or limited with|in
any bounds.</P>
<P>Who shal read his Tract of <HI>Chastity</HI> &amp; <HI>Virgini|ty,</HI>
wherin it is praysed, but wil studie to keep his
body and soule free from adultery and lust, and
say as Saint <HI>Paul</HI> did, that <HI>our bodies are the tem|ples
of the Holy Ghost?</HI> For Chastitie is the
beauty of mans life, consisting either in sincere
Virginity, or in faithfull Matrimony: For cha|stitie,
puritie of life, continencie, or refusing the
corrupt pleasures of the flesh, and of this witty
wicked world; are precious in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of our
Creatour: and doe possesse such as keepe their
bodies cleane and undefiled; and in life and
<PB N="211" REF="105">
conversation refraine from evill. And who is
hee that hath any sence in him or faith, medita|ting
his Divine Sermons of the last judgement,
and Christs second comming; but will speedily
prepare himselfe to appeare, and strive ever so
to live as if he was presently to give an account
of his whole life, for our whole life is nothing
else, but as it were a glue, which in a man faste|neth
the soule and body together, which pro|ceedeth
of the temperament of the Elements,
whereof the bodie is made, which if it bee not
violently melted before, through our owne di|stemperance,
or loosed with the moysture of
our owne merits; or suddenly consumed with
the love or hate of God, weareth away through
age of the body, and so at length comes to no|thing:
Life is of its owne nature a grievous
thing, most miserable and full of innumerable
cares: O life (saith a wise man) how may a man
get from thee without Deaths helpe? thy evils
be infinite, and yet no man is able either to a|void,
nor yet to abide them: And if any good
thing happen to a man in his life; he feeleth also
therewith tribulation and sorrow, as sometime
no other, which maketh our joyes little, and
our life deplorable.</P>
<P>For the manner of his life, it was solitary;
for he would say, by this meanes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gregor. N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n&punc; in vit. Sancti Ephr.</NOTE> <HI>Ex turbulentis
hujus saeculi perturbationibus ac procellis libera|ri,
&amp;c.</HI> that is, He was freed out of the turbu|lent
turmoiles and stormes of this World, that
hee did sweetly enjoy his thoughts without di|straction,
<PB N="212" REF="106">
that hee was the more fit for divine
Contemplation and studie. Yet hee often re|mov'd,
but it was still to doe some notable ser|vice
for the Church of Christ. Hee went to the
Citie of <HI>Edissa,</HI> to visit the Churches, and to
meet with some learned Father to conferre, but
by the providence of God he met with an Har|lot,
who was impudent, yet witty, this <HI>Ephraem</HI>
presently turnd his eyes away not willing to be|hold
her; but she the more earnestly lookt him
in the face to whom hee spoke, Oh woman, why
doe you so greedily gaze on mee, to whom shee
readily replyed, <HI>Ex te viro ego sumi:</HI> I am come
from your loines, why then doe you cast your
eyes upon the earth, out of which you were
taken, and neglect me? well he rejoyced that
GOD had sent him good counsell from the
wicked.</P>
<P>But not staying here hee went to <HI>Caesarea</HI> of
<HI>Cappadocia,</HI> where hee both heard and saw that
sweet Trumpet of Gods glory Saint <HI>Basil,</HI> whom
he entirely reverenced, here he desired of God
to give him abilitie of utterance to preach to
the people, which God gave him abundantly, he
did not any wayes affect prayse, so his will runs:
<HI>Nulla</HI> Ephraem <HI>cecineritis carmina, &amp;c.</HI> that is,
sing no Verses in commendation of <HI>Ephraem,</HI>
bury mee not with any lofty Linnens or Oint|ments,
rayse no Monuments or Tombs, for <HI>I
am a sojourner and a stranger here as all my Fa|thers
were, Psal.</HI> 39. He was wondrously mer|cifull
to the poore, for though hee had not of
<PB N="213" REF="106">
his owne to give, yet by his sweet and attractive
Sermons, he stirred up the hearts of others to
relieve them: he was of so <HI>Angelick</HI> an <HI>Aspect,</HI>
that his <HI>Dove-like</HI> simplicity, his compassion and
integritie was easily decyphered in his counte|nance:
<HI>Gregorius Nyssenus</HI> compares him with
<HI>Abel,</HI> for offering sacrifice to God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 4.</NOTE> which was his
soule and body, <HI>as an acceptable sacrifice;</HI> to
<HI>Enoch</HI> for his constant walking with <HI>God:</HI> to
<HI>Noah,</HI> for his never making shipwrack of <HI>Faith
and a good Conscience.</HI> To <HI>Abraham</HI> for leaving
his owne, and going forth by Gods promises.
To <HI>Isaack</HI> being willing to lay down his life for
the <HI>Gospel.</HI> To <HI>Iaakob</HI> for supplanting <HI>Esau,</HI> so
hee the <HI>Hereticks:</HI> and for blessing the people at
his death. To <HI>Ioseph</HI> for Chastitie; and especial|ly
for distributing the pure wheat of GODS
Word wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ely to the famishing soules: in many
things to <HI>Moses</HI> for striking the <HI>Rocke,</HI> and
bringing forth water from the flinty stone: so
he by the Rod of Gods Word did fetch teares
from hard-hearted men; and brought many to
repentance. To <HI>Iosuah,</HI> for bringing many in|to
the spirituall <HI>Canaan:</HI> to <HI>Samuel,</HI> for devo|ting
his youth to God. To <HI>Elias,</HI> for repro|ving
false Teachers: to <HI>Elizeus,</HI> for abundance
of the spirit; to Saint <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> for living
in the Wildernesse; and teaching men to repent:
To Saint <HI>Paul</HI> for his manifold sufferings, and
indeed it is hard to say, wherein hee was defe|ctive:
at the time of his death hee denied to
have any cost bestowed upon him, but willed
<PB N="214" REF="107">
them to give it to the poore. And a great man
having prepared a rich Vestment for him, said,
That pietie should be respected before povertie;
and so did not give it as <HI>Ephraem</HI> had willed
him: but hee was presently sorely visited, and
could not be released till this old man imposed
his hands on him, and blessed him, and then said

<P>_THe life of this great St. <HI>Basil</HI> is of
worth and rarity, that it is not only
fit for imitation, but also admira|tion;
and therfore I have excerpted
it partly out of his owne works, and partly out
of those funerall Sermons which have beene
made for him, by St. <HI>Gregory Nyssen,</HI> and <HI>Gre|gory
Nazianzen,</HI> the one his halfe brother, the
other his most faithfull and worthy friend, as
also out of St. <HI>Hierome, Amphalochirs</HI> Bishop of
<HI>Iconium,</HI> and <HI>Helladius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Caesarea,</HI> and
successor to St. <HI>Basil:</HI> I also take some passages
out of <HI>Metaphrastes, Suidas,</HI> and Cardinall <HI>Baro|nius.</HI>
A Writer saith of this St. <HI>Basil,</HI> that he wel
<PB N="219" REF="109">
deserv'd the name of Great: for he was <HI>Mag|nus
ingenio, Magnus Eloquio, Magnus Sapientia,
Magnus Sanctimonia, Magnus Divina gloriae
propugnande, propagandaeque Zelo, Magnus ad|versus
Hareticos Constanti&acirc;, Magnus dein omni|bus
rebus &amp; negotiis. (idest)</HI> Hee was great in
Wit, great in Eloquence, great in Wisedome,
great in Sanctity, great in defending, great in
propagating Gods glory, great inconvincing
Heriticks, and great in all his imployments and
undertakings.</P>
<P>He was born in <HI>Helleno-Pont</HI> in the Iland of
<HI>Pontus,</HI> of Noble, Wealthy, and Holy Parents:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birth.</NOTE>
his Fathers name was <HI>Basil,</HI> his Mothers <HI>Emilia;</HI>
they had ten Children, whereof the eldest was
called <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rina,</HI> who dyed a Religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s Virgin:
such as the trees were such were their fruit, for
all their off-spring are commended for piety
and holinesse. His grand-father, and great
grandfather endured heavy miseries and afflicti|ons
for Christs sake under the reigne of the
Emperour <HI>Galerius Maxim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> a sworne enemy
to the Christians: in his time these kept close in
Desarts and Caves, and endured all hardnesse,
as well for their lodging, apparell, diet, as also
expecting each moment when they should have
beene apprehended, and at last suffered constant
Martyrdome for Religion. So you see this <HI>St.
Basil</HI> proceeded from an holy and religious
progeny, and what more is, he was a grace even
to them. He was of a rare wit, and grave judge|ment,
sweetly composed behaviour, won|drously
<PB N="220" REF="110">
modest: he got learning first at <HI>Caesarea,</HI>
then at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> then he went to <HI>Athens.</HI>
where he gain'd and held the love of <HI>Gregory
Nazianzen:</HI> Well, he was wholly bent to the
study of Theology, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nd therefore left <HI>Athens,</HI>
and went into <HI>Aegypt,</HI> to see and heare one
<HI>Porphyrius</HI> read Divinity; and here hee stayed
one whole yeare.</P>
<P>He was of an excellent constitution, but with
much watching, praying, reading, fasting, and
spare diet: he did much wear down his strength.
He left this <HI>Porphyrius,</HI> and travailed to see <HI>Ie|rusalem.</HI>
He converted his Master <HI>Eubulus</HI> to
the Faith of <HI>Christ,</HI> so that he travaild with him
to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> where lodging at <HI>Antioch,</HI> at one
<HI>Libanius</HI> his house, a great rich man: this Saint
<HI>Basil</HI> expounded to this <HI>Libanius</HI> some of <HI>Ho|mers</HI>
verses, wondrous difficult to bee under|stood,
with such readinesse and wit, that hee e|ven
astonished this <HI>Libanius,</HI> so that hee made
them a great banquet; but <HI>Eubulus</HI> and <HI>Basil</HI>
feasted with nothing but meere bread and wa|ter:
and this St. <HI>Basil</HI> strived to have wonne this
<HI>Libanius</HI> from Idolatry to Christianity, but
could not, so deepe was his wilfulnesse: but he
gave admirable directions and instructions to
the young men concerning their behaviour and
deportment in their studies; and so tooke leave
of <HI>Libanius,</HI> and were wondrous kindly enter|tained
of the Bishop of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and were by
him baptized.</P>
<P>Having ended this j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">urney they returned to
<PB N="221" REF="110">
<HI>Antioch,</HI> where <HI>Meletius</HI> the Bishop made this
<HI>Basil</HI> a <HI>Deacon,</HI> and being ordered, he shewed by
his able parts what a Prelate he in time would
prove, for <HI>Antioch</HI> was fild with his fame, so
that he went to <HI>Caesarea</HI> a City of <HI>Palaestine,</HI>
where <HI>Hermogenes</HI> the Bishop consecrated him
a Priest, who presently dying, all mens expecta|tions
were upon <HI>Basil</HI> to have succeeded him,
but Factions arising, one <HI>Eusebius</HI> a Catholike
Christian, but puft up with envy and vaine-glo|ry,
succeeded <HI>Hermogenes,</HI> and this <HI>Eusebius</HI> per|ceiving
the admirable parts of <HI>Basil,</HI> and with|all
the peoples affection to him, began to hate
him, so that <HI>Basil</HI> retreated into <HI>Mataria,</HI> be|yond
the River <HI>Iris,</HI> a solitary place of <HI>Pontus.</HI>
Here he stayed some certain years with <HI>Gregory
Nazianzen,</HI> where they led such holy and godly
lives, that they were esteemed rather divine than
mortall. St. <HI>Gregory</HI> in his 8. <HI>Epist.</HI> hath lively de|scribed
his life with S. <HI>Basil.</HI> Here they were both
driven to that exigency, that if it had not bin for
S. <HI>Basils</HI> mother <HI>Emilia,</HI> they had there perished.
Here St. <HI>Basil</HI> gain'd many schollers, and was fa|mous
as well for his Doctrine, as his pious ex|ample:
and in this place they had matter enough
to exercise their patience, not onely from their
poverty, but also from their adversaries: for it
happened that <HI>Musonius</HI> Bishop of <HI>NeoCaesarea</HI>
dying, when there were publick <HI>meetings</HI> for the
election of another <HI>Bishop,</HI> that might be worthy
the place, as St. <HI>Gregory Thaumaturgus</HI> was, they
all pitched their thoughts upon this <HI>Basil,</HI> which
<PB N="222" REF="111">
so gald the Hereticks of that place, who knew
his Doctrine would overthrow theirs, &amp; his life
shame their doings, that they presently with all
the policy they could, rais'd slanders and op|probrious
disgraces against this man. But <HI>Basil</HI>
like another <HI>Lampe</HI> had so enlightned all <HI>Pontus</HI>
with his vertues, that though <HI>Valens</HI> the Empe|perour
favoured the Hereticks, and though
they did waste the Easterne Churches, and daily
accuse this <HI>Basil:</HI> nay though this <HI>Basil</HI> was ha|ted
of <HI>Eusebius</HI> before, and seemed to be well
content with a solitary life: yet as if stayed up
at this time by God, he reconciles himselfe to
<HI>Eusebius,</HI> who ever after highly loved and estee|med
him: and being departed this life, all men
concluded that there was none so worthy of
this place as St. <HI>Basil:</HI> so by their choyce, and
by the advice of <HI>Gregory Nazianzen,</HI> he yielded
to their requests, and proved a worthy shep|heard
to that flocke, as well by truely feeding
them, as by driving away all Hereticks,
which were as Wolves to devoure the Church.</P>
<P>But scarce was he setled in this Bishoprick, but
there arose a mighty famine in this City: the
rich and Merchants would not part with their
provision, so that there were miserable com|plaints
made by the poore. St. <HI>Basil</HI> to miti|gate
this griefe, did whatsoever he could, for
he sold all his Lands and other goods, and
freely distributed them to the poore, as well
<HI>Iewes</HI> Children as <HI>Christians:</HI> the goodnesse of
this man stayed not here, but as he had made
<PB N="223" REF="111">
himselfe an example to all; so he frequented the
publicke places, and there exhorted the rich by
severall places of Scripture, and sweet spee|ches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg Naz. in laud. S. Bas.</NOTE>
to distribute to the poors necessity; so that
at last hee got provision for the needy. Hee
was also as carefull to see the sick provided for;
and he caused publicke places to be erected for
their maintenance, and would often not onely
visit them, but also administer to them. Some
there were that hated him even for these wor|thy
deeds, but he left not off, but proceeded
the more couragiously, because he was opposed;
for vertue is alwayes envyed, yet it faints not.</P>
<P><HI>Iulian</HI> the Emperour having knowne him at
<HI>Athens</HI> before sent and desired him to write to
him, but though he was Emperour, yet because
of his Apostacy, this <HI>Basil</HI> would not entertaine
any courtesies from him; whereupon this Apo|stata
intended when he had finished the <HI>Persian</HI>
Warre, to have put this <HI>Basil</HI> and <HI>Nazianzen</HI> to
death; but he failed, for he dyed miserably in
that warre: nay, when <HI>Valens</HI> the Emperour
persecuted the Orthodox Christians, and had
remov'd some, and had put 80 Priests into one
Vessell, thinking to have burned them in the
Sea; this <HI>Valens</HI> meeting St. <HI>Basil,</HI> spoke him
faire, and afterward sent to him by severall
messengers to winne him to that Heresie, yet nor
the threats nor promises of this Emperour
could once stirre or move him. Then <HI>Modestus</HI>
his <HI>Praefect</HI> commanded him to be brought be|fore
him, which was perform'd, and <HI>Basil</HI> being
<PB N="224" REF="112">
come, the <HI>Praefect</HI> looking sternly upon him, told
him, he wondred that he could stand before him
so impudently: and art thou only he that oppo|sest
the Emperor? to whom St. <HI>Basil</HI> answered, he
wondred that he should so taxe him of <HI>Impu|dence,</HI>
when as he was free; but he was bound to
obey the King and Emperor of heaven &amp; earth:
but saith the <HI>Praefect,</HI> will you, nil you, you shall
be made to obey: for know you not who we are
that command it? no body, said St. <HI>Basil,</HI> while
you do command such things: Know you not
said the <HI>Praefect,</HI> that we have honours and pre|ferments
to bestow upon you? but said St. <HI>Basil,</HI>
they are but changeable like your selves: then
the <HI>Prefect</HI> said, none of the Christians ever an|swered
him so: perhaps said St. <HI>Basil,</HI> you never
examined a true Bishop before. Upon this the
<HI>Prefect</HI> all in a rage, threatned to confiscate his
goods, to torment him, to banish him, or to
kill him: to whom St. <HI>Basil</HI> made this answer,
he need not feare confiscation, who hath no|thing
to lose; nor banishment, to whom onely
Heaven is a Country: not torments, when his
body would bee dasht with one blow: nor
death, because it was the onely way to set him
at liberty. Thus they parted, onely St. <HI>Basil</HI> had
that night given him to resolve what he would
doe, but he was the same next morning. The
<HI>Prefect</HI> related all to the Emperour, how he lost
his labour in examining this <HI>Basil,</HI> whereupon
the Emperour thought to have disturbed him,
even in the performance of holy duties in the
<PB N="225" REF="112">
Church upon a Twelfth-day; but suddenly
comming in, and seeing the Reverend carriage
of the Bishop, and the Priests about him, all see|ming
as glorious starres, he made a large offe|ring;
but <HI>Basil</HI> refused it, as comming from an
Hereticke. The Emperour was so suddenly
taken with a swimming giddinesse in his head,
that he was faine to be upheld by the hands of
his Courtiers; and after speaking with this St.
<HI>Basil,</HI> he was so mitigated, that he was intended
to have proved favourable to all the Orthodox
Christians: but such was the uncessant malice
and policy of the Hereticks, that they procur'd
that <HI>Valens</HI> banished this Great and famous
<HI>Basil.</HI></P>
<P>And now it was expected that the Emperors
decree should be fulfilled, to the griefe of the
people, and to the joy of the Hereticks, his ad|versaries;
but God crossed this, for the same
night the Physitians had laid the Emperours
sonne <HI>Galate</HI> downe sicke of a doubtfull disease;
whereupon the Empresse told <HI>Valens,</HI> this is a
just revenge from God, inflicted for the banish|ment
of St. <HI>Basil,</HI> whereupon the Emperour cal|led
for him, and said to him; If thy prayers bee
right and faithfull, pray that my Son may live:
to whom St. <HI>Basil</HI> replyed; If you would be of
the same faith, your son would be well: his son
did recover, and <HI>Basil</HI> went home; but shortly
after the Emperor caused the Hereticks to pray
for his sonne; it was performed, but to the grief
of the Emperour afterwards, for his son speedi|ly
dyed.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="113">
The <HI>Arrians</HI> insisted and urged that there
was no hope of good successe as long as <HI>Basil</HI>
stayed at <HI>Caesarea:</HI> whereupon it was decreed
again to have him banished<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, but when the wri|ting
was brought to <HI>Valens,</HI> to confirme, the
pens would not write, being often tried, and the
Emperour could not write, hee was so amazed
and convinced in his owne judgement, finding
that God did protect this <HI>Basil.</HI></P>
<P>Many and great were the troubles and tryals
of this great Bishop, but he still kept his faith
and constancie, and never was moved by feare
or favour, it was not the frownes nor promises
of great Ones that could taint Him, he desired
heavenly, not earthly contentments. So having
beene Bishop of <HI>Caesarea</HI> and <HI>Cappadocia</HI> eight
yeeres, and an halfe, and some odde dayes, hee
departed this life with these words, <HI>Into thy
hands (O Lord) I commend my spirit:</HI> he was bu|ried
with great state and lamenting, by all the
Inhabitants of <HI>Caesarea,</HI> as well <HI>Iews</HI> as Chri|stians;
but above all the Physician which Saint
<HI>Basil</HI> converted from Judaisme to Christianity,
shewed his depth of sorrow.</P>
<P>The Church of God is enriched with the rare
labours of this father. Saint <HI>Gregory Nazianzen</HI>
writing of this Saint <HI>Basils</HI> workes avers thus
much of him, <HI>Neminem ante ipsum ade&ograve; divine,

got himselfe a generall fame and good opinion:
using it also to the edification and instruction of
others in Divinity; For his eloquence was but
the expression of his divine contemplations and
conceptions. <HI>Non enim tam nos ratio juvaret,
nec tam esset in nobis manifesta, nisi quae mente
concepimus, proferre etiam loquendo, possemus.
Ipsa vitae praecepta, ets<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> natura sunt honesta, ta|men

Reason would not be so helpfull to us, nor
so manifest in us, unlesse wee could by speech ex|presse
our conceipts. Even moral precepts of life,
although naturally honest, yet are more power|full
to fashion minds, when cleernesse of speech
doth illuminate their beauty. And in this facul|ty
this famous holy Saint was most powerfull;
so that it may be said. <HI>Veram animae illius pul|chritudinem
in oratione <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lucere, hanc illius comi|tem

shine forth in his eloquence, Rhetoricke being
both his companion and servant.</P>
<P>And to the higher increase of his glory, hee
was a familiar friend to <HI>Basil</HI> the Great, and St.
<HI>Hierome</HI> was his Scholar for Divinitie, more|over
he was of so great authoritie &amp; estimation
in the <HI>Grecian</HI> Church, that whosoever durst op|presse
his testimony was accounted and suspected
for an <HI>Heretike,</HI> and generally hee was a man of
so great learning, integrity and eloquence, that
<PB N="235" REF="117">
his Adversaries durst not contradict his asserti|ons,
so that <HI>Gregories</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, or affirmation
was a confirmation and authority to prove any
point of Divinitie. Hee loved and adored so|litude
and the Monasticke Life, and when for
his excellent Learning and sanctitie of life, hee
should have been made a Bishop, he retired him|selfe
into obscuritie, desiring rather to lead a
poore religious life, than to be advanced to po|pular
<HI>Honour.</HI> But Omnipotent God would not
have so cleere a Light of Religion, which might
illuminate many soules, hidden under the bushel
of a Monastick life. Being therefore by divine
providence discovered and found out, hee was
by the people made a Bishop, and afterward to
excuse his former flying and retiring, a solemne

of Episcopall Government, having con|stituted

more modest then they are, who ambitiously
aspire to undese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ved honour, and more confi|dent
then such as decline all good actions for
feare of being censured.</P>
<P>In a great multitude of people of severall
ages and conditions who are like a <HI>Harpe</HI> con|sisting
of many strings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Naz. in apol.</NOTE> it is hard to give every
one such a touch in words and preaching, that
they may all be pleased, and none offended.</P>
<P>A sparke of envie will sooner inflame the
minde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Naz. in apol.</NOTE> than the flames of vertue can warme the
affection. For a little Worm-wood being cast
into a great deale of Honey presently maketh it
bitter, but twise as much Honey mingled with
Worm-wood will not make it sweete.</P>
<P>Better is that spirituall warfare which doth
make one drawne ere to God&punc;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Naz. in apol.</NOTE> then that peace,
which doth separate from God.</P>
<P>The Art of Arts and Discipline of Disciplines
is government in a man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Naz. in apol.</NOTE> who is of all creatures
most various in manners and divers in will.</P>
<P>The chiefe wisdome is a laudable life and a
pure minde before God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. Naz. in apol.</NOTE> whereby the pure are
joyned to him that is pure, and the holy to him
that is holy.</P>
<P>Hee that for a vertuous course of life begun
desires to be praised,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Greg. lib. 8.</NOTE> hee eats the fruit of his tree
before it is ripe.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Gregory Nazianzen</HI> used to say, that
God required but three things of every man
that should be saved: First, faith and confidence
in God. For <HI>Faith</HI> is the gift of God, and
<PB N="239" REF="118">
breathed by the Spirit of God, into the hearts
of those that be the children of God. And
through a lively, quick, and fruitfull faith, wee
have our first entrance unto God: but the faith
that is without good works is not a lively, but a
dead faith&punc; and therefore now not to be called
faith, no more than a dead man is to be called a
man.</P>
<P>Secondly, continence in his tongue. For the
tongue is a slippery and nimble instrument,
wherby commonly the treasures of the heart are
in such wise unlocked, and laid forth, and spread
abroad, that not onely thereby friendship is
greatly ingendred, earthly treasures increased,
the life quietly stablished, perpetuall prayse and
everlasting felicitie obtained, but contrariwise
friendship is decayed, worldly riches are dimi|nished,
the life most miserably wasted, infamie
and immortall pain is thereby purchased. The
tongue if it be well used, is the most precious
member of a man; but otherwise the most de|testable,
pernicious evill, and full of pestiferous
poyson: And it is most plaine, that the heart
within is very filthy, and fouly defiled and cor|rupted,
whensoever the tongue is wickedly
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, and utterly uncleane, by filthy and wicked
speeches.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Chastity in his body. For Chastity
is the beauty and glory of a man: a chast heart,
(which is onely seene and approved of God) is
most precious and blessed in his sight; and
therefore deserveth of all men, so farre forth to
<PB N="238" REF="119">
be well judged or else condemned, as the words
uttered from the mouth, the manner of outward
gesture, the usage in eating and drinking, and
the order of apparell, seemeth to be honest, mo|dest,
temperate, and seemly: And <HI>Chastitie</HI> with|out
<HI>Charity</HI> is a Lampe without Oile; take the
Oile away and the Lampe giveth no light: take
away <HI>Charity,</HI> then <HI>Chastity</HI> pleaseth not at all.
Therefore that man whose minde is wholy de|dicated
to the use of vertue and chastity of life,
and despiseth the vanities of this life; most cer|tainly
prevaileth and obtaineth salvation in the
end.</P>

<P>_THere were many of this Name, and
therefore it will be convenient and
profitable to the Reader to know
them, that thereby this famous Fa|ther
may bee distinguished from the rest, and
nothing attributed to him, but what doth truly
belong to him. There was one that was called
<HI>Epiphanius Scholasticus,</HI> because he translated
the Tripartite History of the Church out of
Greeke into Latin: as <HI>Cassiodorus</HI> testifies, there
was a second that was Bishop of <HI>Selybria,</HI> other|wise
called <HI>Olybria,</HI> which writ an oration
against the burners of <HI>Images,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Possev. Appar. sac. pag. 509.</NOTE> (as <HI>Possevinus</HI>
saith) another was called <HI>Vlpianus</HI> a Sophister,
<PB N="242" REF="120">
as <HI>Suidas</HI> reports. A fourth of this name there
was, who in the acts of the second <HI>Nicen</HI> Coun|cell,
affirmed that <HI>Eusebius</HI> of <HI>Cesarea,</HI> had in his
Commentaries on the Psalmes spoken some
things of the inequality of the Father, and the
Sonne, which did relish of <HI>Arrianisme,</HI> and spe|cially
upon those words of <HI>Psalme</HI> the foure|teenth,
<HI>Dixi Domino, Deus me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s es Tu: I have
said unto the Lord, Thou art my God.</HI> The fifth
of this name was this reverend Father, whose
Life and Actions I now describe, who was Bi|shop
of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> in <HI>Cyprus,</HI> whom St. <HI>Hierome</HI>
and other famous Historians have largely and
highly commended.</P>
<P>Read his Life therefore with a care, and
purpose to imitate his piety and vertues: Hee
was borne in a Towne of <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> not farre
from the City which takes her name from <HI>E|leutherius:</HI>
borne he was of poore and obscure
Parents, and his father died when he was yong,
and so he was le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t with his mother and his si|ster
Callitr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pe to bee brought up: but they ha|ving
but short meanes were not able to nourish
him, and themselves, had not <HI>Tryphon</HI> tooke
compassion on them, who adopted this <HI>Epipha|nius</HI>
for his owne sonne, and did likewise allow
a sufficiency of provision to his mother, and si|ster
during their lives. Therefore saith a wise
man give unto the good, and hee will requi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
thee againe, or lend it unto others; but give
to the evill disposed, and hee will begge and
crave more; neither have compassion on the
<PB N="243" REF="120">
needy: for he that may give, and giveth not, is
utterly an enemy: And he that promiseth forth|with,
and is long ere he doe it, is but a suspici|ous
friend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> what neede words to our friends,
when we may succour them with works of our
Almes&punc; It is not right that wee render those
who are in necessity onely our tongue, which
is the worst thing without; of whom we re|ceive
the Heart, which is the best thing with|in:
Nor yet when thou hast bestowed thy Cha|rity,
boast not of thy good deeds, least thine e|vill
be also called to remembrance, and laid to
thy charge: But remember this, that a vertuous
and charitable Hand is not bound to make the
Tongue a foole.</P>
<P>Now I cannot but praise God who hath
raised many a famous instrument for the good
of his Church, out of poore and meane families:
<HI>He takes the poore from the Dung hill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 113.</NOTE> <HI>to set him
with the princes of his people,</HI> saith that Princely
Prophet; and here poverty is not to be despised
or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lighted, nor men to be disparaged by the
meanes of their families. A man were better
live poorely, being assured of the blisse of hea|ven,
than to be in doubt thereof, possessing all
worldly riches: For no man is poore, but hee
that thinketh himselfe poore.</P>
<P>This <HI>Triphon</HI> was a <HI>Ie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> well instructed in
the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> who as most thought, took
this <HI>Epiphanius</HI> unto him, to marry him to his
onely daughter; so this <HI>Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">phanius</HI> did live with
this <HI>Triphon,</HI> and grew in yeares, and obtained
<PB N="242" REF="121">
an excellent knowledge in the <HI>Hebrew:</HI> thus it
pleaseth God to make roome for those whom
He intends to advance. Wel, God so disposing all
things, this <HI>Triphon</HI> and his daughter both dy|ed,
and this <HI>Epiphanius</HI> was left with their
whole estate, which was very large, by <HI>Triphons</HI>
onely appoyntment. Enjoying this faire estate,
with the affluence of all contentment (his Mo|ther
also being dead) he tooke his sister into
his house, and lived wondrous pleasantly. It
so fell out that on a time this <HI>Epiphanius</HI> going
to the Towne in which he was borne, by chance
there met him a <HI>Man,</HI> a <HI>Christian</HI> by <HI>Religion,</HI>
whose name was <HI>Lucianus,</HI> famous for his Lear|ning
and Vertue. God doth use to dispose of
Times and Persons: It was well for <HI>Epiphanius</HI>
that God lent him this fair occasion to embrace
<HI>Christianity.</HI> This <HI>Lucianus</HI> led a Monastick life&punc;
strict and holy the professors of it were in those
times, and followed it onely, that they might
the more sweetly and quietly addict themselves
to prayer, meditation, and reading&punc; neither
was it lesse commodious for writing, and to
shunne the snares and tentations of the World;
to subjugate the flesh to the spirit, and to
mortifie sinfull lusts and affections; so being by
this man instructed in Christianity, he was, toge|ther
with his sister, baptized into the Faith of
<HI>Christ Iesus,</HI> by the Bishop of that place: and so
having disposed all his goods to the poore, hee
with <HI>Lucianus</HI> embraced a Monastick course of
ife. This <HI>Lucianus</HI> put him to <HI>Hilarion</HI> to learn,
<PB N="243" REF="121">
whose Manners and Learning <HI>Epiphanius</HI> so
imitated, that he made the vertues of so great a
Master more conspicuous: He increased won|derfully
in Learning daily; so that people began
from all parts to resort to him; so that his
Fame being growne to such an height, he could
not enjoy that privacy in that course of Life
which he desired. Upon this, he made a depar|ture
into <HI>Aegypt,</HI> where he also was highly estee|med
for his rare gifts and endowments: From
hence, after some time he returned to his own
place; where being come, and knowing that
<HI>Hilarion</HI> was sailed to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> having a great
desire to see him, <HI>Epiphanius</HI> sailed to <HI>Paphos,</HI>
and at the first meeting with <HI>Hilarion</HI> was al|most
overcome with joy: presently <HI>Hilarion</HI>
appoynted him to goe to <HI>Salamine;</HI> and so it fel
out, that that Church at the same instant being
voyd and destitute of a Pastor, the faithfull
<HI>Christians</HI> by prayers having intreated God that
they might have one that was faithfull: instant|ly
<HI>Epiphanius</HI> presented himselfe in that place,
and by the prediction of <HI>Pappus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Cytria,</HI>
an holyman of life, and specially God disposing
it so, <HI>Epiphanius</HI> was appoynted the man, who
modestly at first refused this imposed dignity;
but afterwards was made Bishop of that <HI>See,</HI>
in which hee so lived,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">. App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r. sacr. p 510.</NOTE> that as one sayes well

acerrim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s oppugnator: alwayes a sharpe opposer
of Heretiques, witnesse that admirable and pain|full
work of his, called his</HI> Pammachion. He quite
stopped the blasphemous mouth of <HI>Aetius</HI> the
<HI>Valentinian</HI> Bishop, and did reduce all of that
sect to the Orthodox faith; no easie piece of
worke to bring those to embrace the truth, who
for the most part are filled with the spirit of
<HI>Contradiction,</HI> and <HI>Contumacy:</HI> He purged all
<HI>Cyprus,</HI> defiled and slurried with this and other
Heresies; and having gained an Edict from
the Emperour <HI>Theodosius,</HI> he cast out all the
Hereticks out of the Iland: Well, He was a
great Engine in promoting the <HI>Christians</HI> cause&punc;
and as some doe report of him, he was famous
for some Miracles: At length it so fell out, that
<HI>Eudoxia</HI> the Empresse deeply hating <HI>Iohn Chry|sostome,</HI>
this <HI>Epiphanius</HI> was by her called to
<HI>Constantinople:</HI> where being come, he was layed
at by all the faire baits that could be, to stand a|gainst
this famous <HI>Chrysostome,</HI> and to consent
to his deposition; but all their slights could ne|ver
move him from his integrity, and love to
that worthy Father: So hee departs from the
Emperours Court, and entred into a Ship
to have returned to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and made a fa|mous
speech to his fellowes, in which hee did
by all perswasions that could be, stirre up their
Spirits to Innocency of Life, and Constancy in
the <HI>Christian Faith:</HI> For, said He, GOD
would call him from this labour here, and
settle him in glory in Heaven; and so after
<PB N="245" REF="122">
fervent prayers, he embraced them sweetly;
much like as St. <HI>Paul</HI> did the <HI>Ephesians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts. 20.</NOTE> and
uttered these words, <HI>Salvi estote filii, Epipha|nius

that is, God blesse you my Children, for <HI>Epi|phanius</HI>
shall see your faces no more in this life;
and so it came to passe, for hee did depart this
Life shortly after, being aged an hundred and
fifteene yeeres, and three moneths: for a little
before he went into the Ship, <HI>Arcadius</HI> asking
him of his age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Possev. Appar. Sacr. p. 541.</NOTE> he answered, <HI>Sexagesimo aeta|tis

<P>Wrath and revenge (saith a Philosopher) is a

a wilde Bull roring, and braying out despightfull

taketh from man the mercy of God; and destroyeth

these words, <HI>Si vixerit infantuli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s iste, aliquid

infected with the sinnes of that popu|lous
Citie, but did wholly apply himselfe to his

which came to passe five yeares after: <HI>Auxen|tius</HI>
the <HI>Arrian</HI> Bishop being dead, who gover|ned
the Church of <HI>Millain, Dionysius</HI> the Con|fessor
of blessed memory being banish'd, and
the people being divided and almost ready to
rise, and mutiny about the election of a Bishop;
this <HI>Ambrose</HI> to stop the fury of the peoples
rage, and to hinder the <HI>Arrian</HI> faction, under|took
to decide the matter: but of a suddain
there was a voice as it were of a Child heard to
sound these words, <HI>Ambrosium Episcopum,</HI> that is,
<HI>Ambrose</HI> the Bishop, and so both parties, as well
the <HI>Orthodox</HI> Christians, as the <HI>Arrians</HI> cried
out publikely with one consent the same words;
but hee was offended at this, and going out of
the Church caused a tribunall to be erected, and
some persons to be punished: but they cried out;
let his sinne be upon us: and knowing him to be
<PB N="252" REF="126">
a <HI>Catechumenist,</HI> they did promise remission of
his sins by the vertue of baptisme: well he gave
himselfe to study Philosophy shewing indeed
what a wise man he would prove in the Church
of God; nay to divert the peoples intention he
gave admittance to common women to resort
unto him; but seeing that would not take effect,
hee intended to fly and leave the place, so in
the middle of the night hee intended to have
gone to <HI>Ticinum,</HI> but hee was discovered at the
Gate of the City of <HI>Millaine</HI> called <HI>Romana;</HI> so
that God seemed to hinder his flight: so being
kept by the people; word was sent to the
Emperour <HI>Valentinian</HI> how <HI>Ambrose</HI> who was
their Judge, was of all men desired to be their
Bishop: which gladded the good Emperour:
and especially rejoiced <HI>Probus,</HI> who heard that
his words were come to passe; but <HI>Ambrose</HI> a|gaine
prepares to escape, and hides himselfe in
a great mans house called <HI>Leontius;</HI> but the mat|ter
being concluded by the Emperour, and the
peoples desires satisfied, <HI>Leontius</HI> who had for|merly
hid, now brings him forth, well finding no
hopes any longer to resist: hee was brought to
<HI>Millain,</HI> and desired to be baptized by none but a
Catholike Bishop; <HI>Cavebat enim solicite perfi|diam
Arrianorum:</HI> that is, for he did solicitous|ly
beware of, and shun the treachery of the <HI>Ar|rians:</HI>
being baptized, he fulfilled all Episcopall
Functions, &amp; was eight days after his Baptisme,
to the great content of all, named and ordained
Bishop: a few yeares after his Ordination, Hee

goes to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he findes his sister, and the
other <HI>Virgin;</HI> but his Mother was dead: Hee
going over the River <HI>Tyber,</HI> to a rich Womans
House, healed one of the Palsie; which was
published and knowne abroad, only by touching
his Garment, which shee presently devoutly
kissed and was restored.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such power hath God gi|ven to godly men, from time to time.</NOTE> Comming to <HI>Syr|mium,</HI>
to ordaine <HI>Anemius</HI> Bishop, hee was
opposed by <HI>Iustina</HI> a Queen, who would have
not him, but the <HI>Arrians</HI> to doe it: well he pro|ceeded
to it, where an impudent Maid boldly
putting on the priests habit, came boldly and
sate by Saint <HI>Ambrose,</HI> to whom hee spake, that
though hee was unworthy of such an Office
himselfe, yet shee nor any of her Sexe were to be
admitted into the Office of Priesthood, and told
her, shee had neede to feare some heavy judg|ment,
which fell out; for the day following shee
died: having perform'd this, hee returnd to <HI>Mil|lain.</HI>
But <HI>Iustina</HI> prosecuted him with all her
power and malice, for she set the people against
him, and promised them places of eminence and
great rewards, if they would take him and send
him to banishment: Amongst the rest one <HI>Euthy|mius</HI>
thought to have performed it; but failed;
for it is in vaine to dispossesse those whom God
hath placed: but <HI>Iustina's</HI> malice ceased not, but
shee intended to act that by force, which shee
could not by policie: For the <HI>Arrians</HI> by her
counsell beset the Church call'd <HI>Portiana,</HI> and
would not suffer any Catholicks to enter: but
God stirr'd up holy men to put by this plot also:
<PB N="254" REF="127">
at this time there were <HI>Anthems,</HI> and <HI>Hymnes,</HI>
and <HI>Vigils</HI> kept in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Millaine,</HI> and so
have continued in the Western <HI>Churches</HI> to this
day; but the <HI>Arrians</HI> informed <HI>Iustina,</HI> that
<HI>Ambrose</HI> should give men money to give of
that she was troubled with ill spirits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paul. in vit. S. Amb.</NOTE> but that lie
was disclosed, and one of the <HI>Arrians</HI> was pre|sently
possessed of an ill spirit, and was forced
to cry, That so let all those be tormented, which
would deny <HI>Martirs,</HI> or the unitie of the <HI>Tri|nitie,</HI>
or the <HI>Trinity</HI> which Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> main|tained;
but the <HI>Arrians</HI> took him and drowned
him in a fishpond, adding murther to their trea|chery;
but in spight of all these adversaries St.
<HI>Ambrose</HI> every day grew more famous then o|ther;
retaining his Integrity and Humility; at
the same time, as <HI>Paulinus</HI> hath it, there was a
man who was a great Disputant and an <HI>Arrian,</HI>
and would not yield to the truth, being in the
<HI>Church,</HI> where this Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> preached,
saw an <HI>Angell</HI> stand by his eare, as it were speak|ing
to <HI>Ambrose,</HI> what he taught the people; at
which sight hee presently altered his minde,
and was converted to the faith; there were like|wise
two Bedfellows who were <HI>Arrians,</HI> and
they intended to propose a question to Saint
<HI>Ambrose;</HI> and so comming to the <HI>Church</HI> with
a great Company, the question was of <HI>Christs
Incarnation:</HI> these swelling with pride, and
forgetting the power of <HI>God,</HI> or his Judge|ments
upon scorners, both in their comming
fell down suddenly dead; which when Saint <HI>Am|brose</HI>
<PB N="555" REF="127">
heard, hee presently made an admirable
Sermon to confirme the <HI>Incarnation</HI> of <HI>Christ;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambrosii Tom. 4. Epist. 56. ad Valen. Imp. Tom. 5.</NOTE>
as it is to bee read in his Workes: and in his <HI>E|pistle</HI>
sent to <HI>Valentinian</HI> the younger; <HI>Iustina</HI>
being dead, there was a certaine Witch called
<HI>Innocentius,</HI> who being punished for his Villa|nies
and Witchcraft, confest more then hee was
asked, and said, there was an Angell to inflict
greater punishments upon him then those, be|cause
of Saint <HI>Ambrose,</HI> for he had sent Devils
to kill Saint <HI>Ambrose,</HI> but they found him hed|ged
by God, as <HI>Iob</HI> was; so another came to
his bedside with a sword to have kild him, but
could not stirre his hands; and hee confest that
<HI>Iustina</HI> had hired him before her death; so being
sorry and repenting his intent, he was by prayers
restored to the use of his hands. This Saint <HI>Am|brose</HI>
freed a boy possessed with a Devill, which
left him as soone as he came neere <HI>Millain;</HI> the
Conjurers demanding of the Devil why he left
him; he replyed, <HI>se timuisse Ambrosium,</HI> that he
feared <HI>Ambrose:</HI> he was sent by <HI>Probus</HI> the <HI>Pretor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Maximus</HI> being dead, and <HI>Theodosius</HI> residing
at <HI>Millaine,</HI> Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> being plac'd at <HI>Aqui|leia;</HI>
it so fell out that there was a Synagogue of
the <HI>Iewes,</HI> and a Grove of the <HI>Valentinians</HI>
burnt by the Christians; in so much that both
these began to insult over the Orthodox Chri|stians;
these <HI>Valentinian</HI> Heretikes worshipt
thirty gods: whereupon the Governour of the
place sent word to the Emperour what was
done, and the Emperour commanded the Syna|gogue
<PB N="256" REF="128">
to be rebuilded by the Catholick Bishop
of that place; and revenge to be executed on the
Agents; which when Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> heard, hee
presently sent an <HI>Epistle</HI> to perswade the Empe|rour
to revoke his act:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. 17. ad Theodos. Imp.</NOTE> and sent word that hee
was ready to die, rather then fulfill it: So when
hee came to <HI>Millaine,</HI> the Emperour being at
Church, he treated of this in the presence of all
the people, and spoke to the Emperour divine|ly
and couragiously in these words. <HI>Ego te ex
ultimo Imperatorem feci, &amp;c.</HI> that is, I have at
last made you an Emperour: I have delivered
your enemies into your hands; I have subdued
those that rose against you; I have confirmed
you in the Empire; and have made you triumph
without your helpe or power, and now will you
triumph against God, who hath done all this
for you? To whom when Sermon was done, the
Emperour replyed, <HI>Oh, Bishop, you have this
day spoken against us:</HI> but this <HI>Ambrose</HI> did an|swer,
<HI>I have, oh Emperour, spoken for you; and he
did perswade him so divinely, that the Emperour
did revoke his former Decree;</HI> nay, the Bishop
was so carefull to maintaine Gods honour, that
hee would not goe to the Altar, untill the Em|perour
gave him his faith for it: A worthy
Champion and fit for such a place. This you
may see in his Letter to his sister <HI>Marcellina:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. ad Mar|cell. soror. 18.</NOTE> nay,
that miserable destruction and slaughter made
in <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> by the Emperours consent, Saint
<HI>Ambrose</HI> hearing, denied him entrance into the
Church, untill he had done publicke acknow|ledgment:
<PB N="757" REF="128">
to whom the Emperour said: <HI>Da|vid
the King did commit murther and adulterie;</HI>
to whom the Bishop, <HI>Quem secutus es erran|tem,
sequere corrigentem,</HI> that is, as you have fol|lowed
him in his fall, so follow him in his re|pentance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. 59. ad Theodos. Imp.</NOTE>
to which the milde Emperour did a|gree,
and submit.</P>
<P>The fame of Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> his wisdome was
spread farre and neere: so that two mighty and
wise men of <HI>Persia</HI> hearing his fame, addrest
themselves for <HI>Millaine,</HI> and furnished them|selves
with many questions, to aske him to try
his wisdome; so they came and staid disputing
with him by an Interpreter, from the first houre
of the day, untill three of the clocke at night;
and wondring at his wit and wisdome, depar|ted,
and taking their leave of the Emperour
went to <HI>Rome</HI> to see <HI>Probus,</HI> and so went home.</P>
<P>But now <HI>Theodosius</HI> leaving <HI>Italy,</HI> and going
for <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and <HI>Valentinian</HI> being ap|pointed
<HI>Augustus</HI> for all <HI>Gaule,</HI> there was a direct
order under the name of the Senate, by one <HI>Sym|machus</HI>
for the restoring of the Altar of victory,
and for the charges of the Ceremonies: but St.
<HI>Ambrose</HI> finding the plot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. 11. &amp; 12.</NOTE> writ to the <HI>Emperour</HI>
and so wrought, that <HI>Symmachus</HI> was not able
to effect his desires: but when <HI>Valentinianus</HI>
was dead at <HI>Vienna,</HI> then <HI>Eugenius</HI> undertooke
the <HI>Empire,</HI> and <HI>Flavianus</HI> the <HI>Prefect</HI> with <HI>Ar|gobastes,</HI>
desired to have the said Altar restored:
which when <HI>Eugenius</HI> granted, <HI>Ambrose</HI> hea|ring
this departed from <HI>Millaine,</HI> came to <HI>Bono|nia,</HI>
<PB N="258" REF="129">
and so to <HI>Faventia,</HI> where staying a while,
The <HI>Florentines</HI> entreated him to go to <HI>Thuscia,</HI>
which he yielded not, desiring to see the face of
that sacrilegious person; and presently sent
him a Divine Letter, as you may read in his
Works; while he stayed in <HI>Florence,</HI> there was
one <HI>Decens</HI> in whose house St. <HI>Ambrose</HI> abode,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epist. 15. ad Eugeni.</NOTE>
who had a son cald <HI>Pansophius,</HI> who was possest
with an ill spirit, but by the prayers of S. <HI>Ambrose</HI>
and the imposition of his hands he was restored:
He built there a great Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Hort. ad Vir. Tom. 4.</NOTE> and therein laid
the relikes of <HI>Vitalis</HI> and <HI>Agricola,</HI> whose Corps
were found in the Citie <HI>Bononia,</HI> for they were
promiscuously buried amongst the <HI>Iews.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Argobastes</HI> the Commander at the same time
prepared for Warre, and having raised a mayne
Army, overthrew the Adversaries: being in
banquet with the Kings of that people; they as|ked
him whether hee knew Saint <HI>Ambrose,</HI> to
whom <HI>Argobastes</HI> replyed, hee knew him very
well, and loved him deerly, to whom they re|plyed:
<HI>Ideo vincis, quia ab</HI> Ambrosio <HI>diligeris,
qui dicit soli, sta, &amp; stat,</HI> Therefore thou over|commest,
because thou art beloved of <HI>Ambrose,</HI>
who saith to the Sun stand, and it standeth.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> leaving <HI>Tuscia,</HI> returned to
<HI>Millaine,</HI> when as <HI>Eugenius</HI> went to war against
<HI>Theodosius, Flavianus,</HI> and <HI>Argobastes</HI> going like|wise
said, That when they returned conquerors,
they would make the great Church in <HI>Millaine</HI>
a stable for their Horses; and try the Priests by
force of armes: but they fail'd: for <HI>Eugenius</HI> fell
<PB N="259" REF="129">
by his owne souldiers, and <HI>Theodosius</HI> got the
victory; which when <HI>Ambrose</HI> heard, hee re|joyced,
and sent his Deacon with Letters to the
Emperour, to pardon those that were Agents
and involv'd in that warre; and then sent <HI>Iohn</HI> a
<HI>Tribune,</HI> afterwards <HI>Praetor,</HI> to perswade the
Emperour to spare those that had fled to <HI>Chur|ches:</HI>
nay, hee himselfe came to <HI>Aquileia,</HI> and
prayed for them, whose petition the mild Em|perour
easily granted, and falling at his feet, con|fest,
he was preserved by his praiers, &amp; afterwards
went to Church, and gave his three sons into the
Bishops hands, and died not long after: About
which time the corps of <HI>Nazarius</HI> the Martyr,
was found in a Garden not corrupted, nor his
haire on his head falne, but the corps was redo|lent,
and so were buried in the great Church at
<HI>Millaine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambr. serm. 14 de <HI>S. S.</HI> Tom. 5.</NOTE> by Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> his care. This Bishop
was very abstinent, full of watching and pray|ers,
diligent in writing, never dining but on
Sundays, or at the Celebration of the Birth-days
of the Martyrs. Hee weakened his body with
writing, he had an especiall care for all the Chur|ches,
wondrous couragious for Gods Truth,
mercifull he was also to the poore and captives;
at at time when hee was ordained Bishop, hee
gave all his money to the Church, and to the
poore; all his Lands, onely some reserved for
the mayntenance of his sister, hee bestowed on
the Church: hee rejoyced with those that rejoy|ced,
and wept with those that wept; hee would
weep when hee heard any Religious Priest to be
<PB N="260" REF="130">
dead, because the Church wanted such men; hee
foretold his death: Hee grieved deeply to see
the covetousnesse of men who oppressed the
poore.</P>
<P>A little before hee lay down sick, hee reading
the 43 Psalme, in the sight of <HI>Paulinus,</HI> there
appeared, as it were, a bright fire entring into
his mouth, and his face presently was as white
as snow:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paulin. in. vit. Ambros.</NOTE> which so amazed <HI>Paulinus,</HI> that hee
could not write what came from Him; the Cap|taine
<HI>Stilicho</HI> had a servant possessed, and Saint

false things, and <HI>Stilicho</HI> should have punished
him: <HI>Ambrose</HI> hearing of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ad the servant to
bee brought to him, to whom Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI>
said, he should be delivered to Satan, which came
to passe immediatly: Hee healed likewise <HI>Nice|tius</HI>

one Priest of <HI>Ticinum,</HI> he fell sick, and <HI>Sti|licho</HI>
hearing, said, That all <HI>Italie</HI> would be rui|ned
when so pious a man died. Foure Deacons
in his sicknesse, discoursing softly, who should
succeed him; one answered, <HI>Symplicianus:</HI> and
<HI>Ambrose</HI> by inspiration answered presently, <HI>Se|nex,

a good man, at which they were affrighted;
which came to passe, for <HI>Symplicianus</HI> did suc|ceed
him; and <HI>Venerius</HI> succeeded <HI>Symplicianus:
Foelix</HI> governed the Church at <HI>Bononia; Castus</HI>
and <HI>Polemius</HI> bred under Saint <HI>Ambrose,</HI> conti|nued
Deacons in <HI>Millaine:</HI> before hee died hee
was instant in prayer: those that stood by heard
<PB N="261" REF="130">
him pray with his hands lifted up, and so he de|parted
this life, and was buried in a Church cal|led
by his name, with the confluence of abun|dance
of people of all sorts and ages; hee was
another <HI>Elias,</HI> and feared not to speak the truth
before Kings and Emperours, so that hee got

<P><HI>Baronius</HI> and divers others have writ his life,

<P>But if there were nothing else to set forth his
praise, and to cause him to be worthily ranked
amongst the great Fathers of the <HI>Primitive
Church:</HI> it is enough that hee was sent into ba|nishment
by the <HI>Arrian</HI> Hereticks, under the
Emperour <HI>Valens;</HI> and this Emperour dying, he
was appoynted the onely man by the <HI>Antiochi|an</HI>
Synod, to goe and settle, and order the Ea|sterne
Churches: had he not been eminent and
faithfull, the Fathers of that Councell would
not have employed him in so weighty a charge;
for it is a labour full of difficultie, and must be
undertaken with a great deale of wisdome and
patience: and this honourable charge was not
onely imposed upon his shoulders; but also the
Oecumenicall Synod of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> under
<HI>Theodosius</HI> the Emperour, destined this man as
most fit to visit the Churches planted in <HI>Arabia:</HI>
so that for these his actions, hee is worthy to be
accounted amongst the chiefest <HI>Champions</HI> of

highly respected in those Primitive times; and
so joyning Theology to his other indow|ments,
he proved in short time an eminent Pil|lar
of the Truth: he did read the Scripture with
all diligence, reverence, and strictnesse, having
a speciall regard to the genuine sence of it, at all
times: so being made Bishop of <HI>Nyssa,</HI> of which
City he tooke name, he did for a while surcease
the reading of the old and new Testaments, and
addicted himselfe to the study of Rheto|rique;
insomuch, that <HI>Gregory Nazianzen</HI> in
his 43 Epistle to him seemes a little to repre|hend
him: for his time of comming to his
Bishoprick, it was under <HI>Valens,</HI> when <HI>Gregory
Nazianzen</HI> had the Bishopricke of the <HI>Sasimes</HI>
allotted him by St. <HI>Basil:</HI> This <HI>Gregory</HI> did (as

<P><HI>_NIcephorus</HI> the Historian hath taken
the greatest paines and travell a|mongst
all others to describe the
life of this <HI>Theodoret</HI> at large, and
therefore I shall principally follow his steps.
This <HI>Theodoret</HI> (saith hee) was born at <HI>Antioch,</HI>
a famous place, and an ancient Citie, and re|nowmed
for many things; but specially for that,
in that the Disciples were first called Christians
in this place:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 11. 26.</NOTE> as also for the Apostles determi|ning
that great question about Circumcision,
sent their resolutions to this place, by <HI>Paul</HI> and
<HI>Barn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">bas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 15. 22, 23.</NOTE> with <HI>Iudas</HI> and <HI>Silas, The Apostles
and the Elders with the Brethren unto the bre|thren
<PB N="278" REF="139">
which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and
in Syria, and Cilicia, &amp;c.</HI> so that this Citie is
ennobled in this respect, and as the place of his
birth did grace him, yet more did his parents
Nobilitie and Religion; for they were both
great personages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Niceph. in vita Theodoret.</NOTE> and both addicted to Christi|an
Religion: but his Mother (as my Authour
testifies) was grieved in minde deeply because
she was barren, and was without any hope of
issue to inherit their large possessions; so that
they both resolv'd to bequeath all their Reve|nues
to the mayntenance of Christians, and to
Monasteries whereof there were many in <HI>Syria;</HI>
but by her prayers shee was heard, and God did
not deny her the request of her lips; but did
grant her her hearts desire, and fulfilled her re|quests,
and sent her a sonne which (shee said)
should be dedicated to God, and shee was as
good as her word, for his name imports as
much as <HI>a gift of God,</HI> or <HI>Theodoret:</HI> well this
her sonne by the provident care of the parents,
and by the acutenes and excellencie of his own
wit, in a short time profited so in pietie and let|ters,
that though (as <HI>Procopius</HI> testifies) <HI>juvenis
consecratus Episcopus</HI> Cyri, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hee was very
young, yet hee was chosen and consecrated Bi|shop
of <HI>Cyrus,</HI> which is a Towne of <HI>Syria</HI> of
the <HI>Iews,</HI> which was builded by <HI>Cyrus</HI> King of
<HI>Persians,</HI> and was by him enfranchised and en|dowed
with many priviledges; what hee did,
being now seated in this Reverend place, you
will by the sequell perceive: what a worthy
<PB N="279" REF="139">
worke did he presently set forth call'd the <HI>Histo|rie</HI>
of the <HI>Lovers of God?</HI> was hee not as vigi|lant
to find out and discover, nay, to expell He|retikes
out of the Church, or reducing them to
it? At the same time there were whole Parishes
in his Diocesse infected with the pestilent Here|sie
of the <HI>Marcionites,</HI> and did not he by his sole
wisdome and labour, even to the hazard of his
owne life, bring them backe into the bosome of
the Catholike Church? which thing alone
shews him to be an able and learned Prelate: for
it is a taske of tasks to learn men to swim against
the streams of their own perverted wils; and to
make obstinacie it selfe to submit and yield; was
he not wondrous diligent to gather the bodies
of the Saints, and interre them with great re|spect;
and in the honour of them to build fa|mous
Temples? as (also imitating his parents
piety) was he not wondrous charitable too, and
conversant with those that lived an holy Mo|nastick
life? did not he visit them? and refresh
their bowels with the bowels of love and com|passion.
Especially one <HI>Symeon</HI> called <HI>Stillites,</HI>
which lived austerely, and one <HI>Iacobus Nizibe|nus,</HI>
and many others whose lives and vertues
hee writ elegantly, and left them to posterity.
Hee was a carefull imitator of <HI>Iohannes Chryso|stomus,</HI>
for he alwayes proposed him as his wor|thiest
patterne in forming his stile of writing;
and by this means hee proved so fluent and elo|quent,
so full of grace and learning in his works:
It is good to have worthy patternes to imitate,
<PB N="280" REF="140">
and it is no lesse ingenuitie to gather good by
them, they are lent for the same purpose: how
sweet and beautifull are his studious and melli|fluous
Commentaries upon the <HI>Scriptures?</HI>
How divinely doth he resolve the hardest places
of the old Testament? How significantly hath
he explained the Prophets, how elegantly hath
he delineated that sweet singer of <HI>Israel?</HI> What
learning is there wanting in his divine <HI>Treatise</HI>
of <HI>Gods providence?</HI> How strenuously and
powerfully hath he laid open the fond conceits
of abundance of Heretikes; as of <HI>Symon Ma|gus,
Menander, Basilides; Carpocrates?</HI> of <HI>Her|mogenes,
Tatianus, Cerdo, Marcion,</HI> and <HI>Manes?</HI>
Of <HI>Hymenaeus,</HI> and <HI>Phyletus, Ebion, Cerinthus,
Paulus Samosatenus, Sabellius, Marcellus,</HI> and
<HI>Photinus?</HI> Of the <HI>Nicolaitans, Montanists,

Macedonius, Donatus, Meletianists, Apol|linarians,
Messalians, Nestorians</HI> with the <HI>Euty|chians?</HI>
in the which labours hee hath shewed
to all ages to come, what gifts and endowments
hee had lent him of God, and how well and
faithfully hee used them to his Creatours glory,
and the Churches benefit; I cannot let passe
that hot contention that once was betwixt that
worthy Father of the Church Saint <HI>Cyril,</HI> and
himselfe, sprung rather from <HI>zeale</HI> to <HI>Religion</HI> in
them both, and from the study of <HI>pietie,</HI> then
any vaine <HI>ambitiou,</HI> or self-conceit of their own
sufficiencies: and it is not a wonder; for where
doth not that great fire-brand of Hell, strive to
<PB N="281" REF="140">
kindle the fire of dissention and division, was
not there strife even amongst the Apostles? and
great ambition, had it not beene regulated by
our Saviour? This contention betwixt these
two Fathers happened in this manner: whereas
there was a Synod appointed at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> to stop
the grouth and spreading of the Heresie of <HI>Ne|storius</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Constantinople;</HI> which did
daily begin to spread it selfe, and to infect divers
with its contagion, this Saint <HI>Cyrill</HI> being first
come, had by his owne labour and wisdome
condemned <HI>Nestorius</HI> for an Hereticke, not
knowing that <HI>Iohn</HI> Bishop of <HI>Antioch,</HI> or the
other Bishops of <HI>Syria</HI> would have been there:
but when <HI>Iohn</HI> Bishop of <HI>Antioch,</HI> and the o|ther
<HI>Syrian</HI> Bishops, amongst whom this <HI>Theo|doret</HI>
was one of the chiefe were come, and per|ceived
that <HI>Cyrillus</HI> did not seem to respect their
counsels; they tooke it ill at his hands, and
thereupon canceld his Decrees as void; and so
by a generall consent with a great deale of la|bour,
they all condemne this <HI>Nestorius;</HI> it is
thought, that had not the care and wisdome of
<HI>Theodosius</HI> the younger calling the Bishops to|gether
to <HI>Constantinople</HI> taken away, and re|moved
this contention, it would not have so
soone ended, but hee did take it away, and
<HI>Nestorius</HI> was anathematized, and <HI>Theodoret</HI>
and Saint <HI>Cyrill</HI> wondrous loving one to ano|ther
ever after: to proceed, that renowmed
Councel of <HI>Calcedon,</HI> wherein sate 600 Bishops,
and above, where this <HI>Theodoret</HI> was present;
<PB N="282" REF="141">
I say the testimony of that so learned a Councell
is a large proofe of this mans Faith and Integri|ty:

Pestor of the Church, and a sincere Doctor for
the truth: a large commendation from the
mouthes of such a cloud of learned Witnesses,
which bestowed it not on him for flattery or fa|vour,
but by desert and merit: doe not the lear|ned
Epistles of <HI>Leo</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> sent
to him, sufficiently commend him? by which
it may easily be perceived how vigilant hee was
to settle Truth in the borders of the Church,
and how carefully he preserved the Faith a|mongst
the high swelling surges of Heresies
unviolated? will not his daily meditations and
explanations in, and of the sacred Scriptures
eternize his fame to posterity? Doth not <HI>Genna|dius</HI>

<P>_THis great and eminent Father of the
Church must bee ranked according
to his deserts: In writing whose life
I follow the directions of <HI>Erasmus</HI>
of <HI>Roterdam.</HI> To begin therefore; the time
of his Birth was under the Reigne of <HI>Constan|tine</HI>
the Great, in the yeare of Christ 331, in a
Towne called <HI>Stridon,</HI> which was ovethrown
by the <HI>Gothes,</HI> then wasting and spoyling seve|rall
places: Upon the borders of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and
<HI>Pannonia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hieron in cat. Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iptorum illustrium.</NOTE> as he himselfe testifies, some, as <HI>Blon|dus</HI>
will have it, to be that which now is called
<HI>Sdrigna,</HI> a little Town of <HI>Histria</HI> in <HI>Italie:</HI> some
hold, that to this day there is to be seene Saint
<PB N="289" REF="144">
<HI>Hieroms</HI> Monument. He had a yonger brother
called <HI>Paulinianus:</HI> his mothers name was <HI>Ca|storina;</HI>
His Fathers name was <HI>Eusebius:</HI> but
we will not insist upon his parents, but will de|clare
his owne worth: he had sufficient meanes,
as may appeare by his education, which was at
<HI>Rome;</HI> then counted the onely Nursery of Let|ters,
as hee doth testifie: for though learning
was at the same time in <HI>France, Spaine,</HI> and <HI>Af|fricke,</HI>
yet no where was it so free from pollu|tion
and corruption as at <HI>Rome.</HI> His Master,
for the Grammar, was <HI>Donatus,</HI> and <HI>Victorinus</HI>
for the Rhetorique. Some have made question,
whether this <HI>Donatus</HI> were the same that made
such eloquent Commentaries on <HI>Terence</HI> and
<HI>Virgil:</HI> Well, making faire hopes of a large
progresse in Learning, and being well furnished
in these, he proceeds to read <HI>Porphyrius Isa|goge,</HI>
or Introduction to Logique, and read the
Philosophy of <HI>Plato,</HI> and the <HI>Stoicks;</HI> but not
staying here, he lookes now into <HI>Cosmography,
History,</HI> and <HI>Antiquities;</HI> and intends to study
<HI>Divinity,</HI> and to set it forth with all the lustre
that might be. His fellow students were <HI>Pam|machius,
Bonosus:</HI> both these were highly born.
<HI>Heliodorus,</HI> who for his eminency of parts was
made a Bishop.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Epist. ad Damas pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> This <HI>Hierome</HI> received his bap|tisme
also at <HI>Rome,</HI> as he proves: and now being
sufficiently seasoned with these Arts, he soares
higher, and followes the foot-steps of learned
men, as <HI>Pythagoras, Plato, Apollonius;</HI> and so he
addresseth himselfe to travaile: he surveyed all
<PB N="290" REF="145">
<HI>France,</HI> aud gained acquaintance and love of
the chiefest Scholars: hee testifies that he was
at <HI>Triers,</HI> where hee described that Booke of
St. <HI>Hilaries de Synodis</HI> with his owne hands;
and <HI>Bonosus</HI> travailed with him, as may be seen
in his <HI>Epistle</HI> to <HI>Florentius;</HI> so having taken a
view of most of the Libraries, and having con|ferred
with the learnedest in those places whi|ther
he came, he visited the place of his Birth,
and the place of his new <HI>Birth,</HI> having like a
wise Merchant stored himselfe with abundance
of Goods, hee resolves upon a course of life,
and a fit place to settle downe in: hee likes not
<HI>Rome,</HI> as savouring somewhat of <HI>Paganisme,</HI>
and was too full of pleasures, which are dan|gerous
<HI>Baits</HI> for young men to bee insnared
with: Neither doth he like his owne Country,
being corrupted with <HI>Barbarous delights,</HI> as he
testifies himselfe in his <HI>Epistles,</HI> saying, <HI>In my
Country they make their belly their god; and he
is counted the holiest, which is the richest.</HI> So ta|king
advice with his fellowes, he resolved to
depart into some remote place, that he might
the freer give himselfe to the study of the holy
Scriptures, and the more truely follow our
Saviour. <HI>Pammachius</HI> advised him to marriage,
but this <HI>Hierome</HI> desired liberty. <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">osius</HI> hee
perswades him to a Monasticke course of living
in some remote Island. Well, the minde of St.
<HI>Hierome</HI> was thus resolved, hee got him a rich
Library, and tooke a competency of meanes for
his support and maintenance; hee goes into
<PB N="291" REF="145">
<HI>Syria</HI> with <HI>Heliodorus</HI> with him: but <HI>Heliodorus</HI>
repents him of his resolution, and so returnes
home: it is thought that they both in their
journey saw <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> which was famous at
that time. And being now destitute of his
<HI>friends,</HI> his body was much altered by change|ing
his course of life, so that hee was sicke,
but was wondrously courteously used by a
Monke, but more especially by <HI>Euagrius,</HI> who
afforded him lodging kindly at his house: be|ing
recovered to his health, with a great ardour
of soule he set himselfe to follow Christ: so he
departed farre off into a solitary place, where
was no company but wilde <HI>Beasts</HI> and <HI>Serpents,</HI>
and a few Cells of Monkes here and there scat|tered
among the <HI>Syrians</HI> and <HI>Agarens,</HI> onely
<HI>Euagrius</HI> would now and then even in this
his solitarinesse give him a visit: <HI>Ruffinus</HI>
who of a former friend, became an Enemy,
at this time came to <HI>Nytria</HI> of <HI>Egypt;</HI> and now
also his brother <HI>Paulinianus</HI> having betaken
himselfe to a Religious course of life, was after
a while made a Priest; which thing <HI>Iohn</HI> Bishop
of <HI>Hierusalem</HI> did not approve of, but Saint
<HI>Hierome</HI> doth answer it sufficiently, his dislike
grew, because <HI>Paulinianus</HI> was made so young,
being not yet thir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y yeeres old, as m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y be seene
in his Epistle to <HI>Paulinianus.</HI></P>
<P>Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> lived foure yeeres in this state,
all this while subjugating his body, and study|ing
and meditating continually, with watching,
fastings and prayers; and serio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sly repenting
<PB N="292" REF="146">
the sins, which he had in his youth committed;
and imploring Gods grace to preserve him from
future temptations: So that as <HI>Erasmus</HI> speaks,
hee did not onely study hard all day, but spent
most part of the night in pious performances,
so that, <HI>Minima pars noctis dabatur somno, mi|nor
cibo, nulla otio,</HI> that is, Hee did allow the
least time to sleepe, little for refreshments by
diet, none for idlenesse. When hee was weary
with study, he would go to prayer, or to sing an
<HI>Hymne;</HI> he read over all his Library, and what
is rare, <HI>sacras literas ad verbum ediscebat,</HI> that is,
he learnt the Scriptures perfectly to a word, hee
was vigilant in reading the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and find|ing
out the intent of their prophesies; he was
studious in the <HI>Evangelists</HI> that he might know
our <HI>Saviours</HI> life the better, and with more
ease and profit follow it. His prayer was, Lord,
let me know my selfe first, that I may the better
know thee, the Saviour of the world. Hee was
so addicted to reading, that hee would let none
passe him, no not, <HI>Ethnicos, non Haereticos,</HI>
not the Heathenish <HI>Authours,</HI> nor yet the
Heretikes: what he read with judgement, he
made use of knowing how to fetch Gold from
a dunghill, or Medicines from poyson; by this
meanes so fitting each Authour for his owne
memory, that hee was able to speake suddenly
upon any point of Learning; hee was mainly
taken with <HI>Origen,</HI> so that hee cald him by way
of praysing him <HI>Suum,</HI> his owne; that little
Book which he writ to his Associate <HI>Heliodorus</HI>
<PB N="293" REF="146">
shewes sufficiently what an able man hee would
prove in the schoole of Christ.</P>
<P>Hee had excellent skill in <HI>Hebrew,</HI> knowing
how necessary it was for the understanding of
the Scriptures, which he got of one <HI>Bar-hamina,</HI>
hee obtained excellent knowledge in <HI>Chaldee,</HI>
knowing that some of the Prophets; as <HI>Daniel,</HI>
and some other books as that of <HI>Iob,</HI> was writ|ten,
not onely in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> but also in the
<HI>Chaldaick Dialect;</HI> so likewise did he gaine the
<HI>Syrian,</HI> because of some affinity with the <HI>Hebrew.</HI>
Now having past so long a time in this strict
and rigid course of life, by the perswasions of
<HI>Epiphanius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Salamine,</HI> and <HI>Paulinus</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Antioch,</HI> whom upon some necessary
employments the Emperour had calld to <HI>Rome;</HI>
some say hee was made Priest at twentie yeeres
of age by <HI>Liberius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome;</HI> but hee
testifies hee was ordained at <HI>Antioch,</HI> by <HI>Pauli|nus</HI>
aforesaid. When hee came to <HI>Rome,</HI> hee was
acquainted with many Noble <HI>Matrons,</HI> especi|ally
<HI>Marcella,</HI> who being stirr'd up by <HI>Athana|sius,</HI>
and other Priests of <HI>Egypt,</HI> was the first
of that sex, that profest a Monasticke life at
<HI>Rome&punc;</HI> and shee by her faire devout carriage
gained others aswell Virgins, as Matrons, to the
same profession; especially <HI>Sophronia, Princi|pia,
Paula,</HI> and <HI>Eustochium:</HI> to whom divers
others joyned themselves; and <HI>Hierome</HI> instru|cted
them, and stirr'd up their spirits to the stu|die
of the holy Scriptures; but hee wanted not
those that envied him; for there came in
<PB N="294" REF="147">
closely at the same time certaine <HI>Arrians</HI> under
the name of <HI>Origenists;</HI> whom they knew this
S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">int <HI>Hierome</HI> had in high esteeme; and so they
did strive to defame his splendour, by raising
scandals of him, so that hee left the City of
<HI>Rome</HI> as unworthy of him, and (as some write)
<HI>Melania</HI> and <HI>Paula</HI> went with him, or else did
presently follow him, hee describes his journey
in his Workes, and gives sufficient Reasons
why he went, and why he visited so many places;
hee termes <HI>Gregory Nazianzen</HI> his Master for
<HI>Divinitie;</HI> hee heard likewise <HI>Apollinarius</HI> at
<HI>Antioch;</HI> hee went to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> but for the
practice of <HI>Divinitie</HI> he chose to live in <HI>Bethe|lem,</HI>
which hee made famous by his excellent
preaching; Here <HI>Paula</HI> builded foure Mona|steries,
three for women, one for men, in
which Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> lived many yeeres, as hee
testifies in his <HI>Epitaph</HI> of <HI>Paula; Ruffinus</HI> pro|secuted
Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> with a great deale of
malice; in so much that Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> began
to suspect him, untill he better knew his life and
learning; yet though this <HI>Ruffinus</HI> was so bitter
against him; Hee had famous men that stood
for him, as <HI>Epiphanius</HI> in <HI>Syria, Theophilus,</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Alexandria, Marcella, Pammachius,</HI>
and <HI>Chromati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> at <HI>Rome:</HI> so that being much
threatned and hated by these <HI>Arrians,</HI> his life
may be term'd a tedious Martyrdome, hee stu|died
<HI>Gods Word</HI> thirty yeeres: having buried
<HI>Paula</HI> his <HI>Disciple,</HI> the time came that his course
was accomplished, and so in the ninety one
<PB N="295" REF="147">
of his age, of <HI>Christs Nativitie,</HI> 422.</P>

<P>_I Am now to Write and describe to

Church of God inioyd in many ages:<NOTE PLACE="marg">As Bellarm. in 398.</NOTE>
whom to prayse is but of Desert;
whom not to Commend, would seeme barba|rous
and unchristian. He was an Auditour and
Disciple to <HI>Eusebius;</HI> then when hee was Priest
at <HI>Antioch:</HI> hee got this name <HI>Chrysostome,</HI> as
one saith, <HI>Ob venustatem Eloquii,</HI> for his grace|full
Eloquence: it signifies a golden tongue, for
hee was prevalent and attractive, a man most
learned in Theology, of an admirable Wit in
his framing his Homilies, hee was beloved
and reverenced of all men; His fathers name
<PB N="305" REF="152">
was <HI>Secundus,</HI> and his mothers name was <HI>An|thusa,</HI>
both able and noble: Hee was borne at
<HI>Antioch;</HI> in which place, after some time spent
in secular affaires, he entred into the Priesthood,
and was made Governour of the Church at
<HI>Antioch,</HI> and <HI>Nectarius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Constantino|ple</HI>
dying, being by the perswasions of <HI>Arcadius</HI>
the Emperour placed Bishop in the same See,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sophr. in prat. spirit. cap. 119.</NOTE>
hee did worthily manage that great charge: <HI>So|phronius</HI>
doth highly commend this man, for
hee writes, <HI>Nunquam eum mentitum fuisse, nec
unquam alicuj maledixisse, ne&abque; scurrilialoquutum,
nec Iocos admisisse: i. e.</HI> That he never told a lye:
never cursed any, never spoke any scurrilous mat|ter:
never admitted of vaine sports. Admirable
parts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> and indeede fit for a man of his Calling:
many learned men have admired his parts: <HI>A|nianus</HI>

peculiar <HI>gift</HI> and <HI>property,</HI> that though won|drously
studious, alwayes watchfull, though an
enemy to dulnesse and stupidity; yet never doth
his words flye out into vaine flashes, but still
applyed to the profit of the hearer, for his
very stile is accommodated to the profit of the
Church, expressing antiquity and learning to|gether;
neyther too lofty, nor too meane: at all
times keeping equality and measure, full ripe,
modest, free from all fault of too much affected
curiosity: not too luxuriant, not sordid, nor
yet too much garnished; yet sufficiently and
powerfully trimmed and decked; not too sub|tile,
<PB N="306" REF="153">
not too smart or sharpe, unwantonly, plea|sant,
wondrously copious, expressing an admi|rable
faculty of the Master, yet alwaies free
from pride: hence it is, that the plain man may
read him with profit, and the greatest scholar
cannot but praise him with just desert. He doth
not onely equallize Saint <HI>Basil,</HI> nor yet paral|lell
Saint <HI>Gregory,</HI> but exceeds them: in a word,
here the curious Palate shall find true <HI>Eloquence</HI>
joyned with <HI>Wisdome:</HI> sound <HI>Theology</HI> set forth
with <HI>lustre: Holinesse</HI> and <HI>Scholarship</HI> joyned in
one, in his Works throughout; there is store of
Bread and abundance of Milke, with variety of
sweet Delicates of all sorts for Divines. In his
<HI>Homilies</HI> to the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixtus Senens.</NOTE> he studied for their pro|fit,
not to tickle their eares, but to ravish their
hearts, performing in all the office of a painfull
Doctor: he was industrious in his <HI>Expositions,
powerfull</HI> in his <HI>Morals,</HI> in all full of <HI>Complacen|cy;</HI>
hee would tell his <HI>Auditors,</HI> they were not
onely to <HI>learne,</HI> but to exercise themselves in
practising, and searching the Scriptures, lest
they should bee addicted to <HI>Idlenesse:</HI> Hee very
seldome handled any questions that were curi|ous
to the Auditors; as of <HI>Predestination, Re|probation,</HI>
of <HI>Grace,</HI> or of <HI>Free-will;</HI> but when
necessity, and the Auditory in his judgement
were fit to understand them; then hee perfor|med
them plainly, soundly, and with a great
expression of <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Learning.</HI></P>
<P>He had excellent judgement in <HI>Morality,</HI> and
did contemne <HI>Riches,</HI> and hated <HI>Vices,</HI> so that

<P>1. That if the Churches Discipline bee not
strictly maintained, corruption of manners pre|sently
breake in: for want of <HI>Discipline</HI> ushers
in Licentiousnesse.</P>
<P>2. That when Churches are fallen from
their pristine and ancient Government, they
are to bee reformed by <HI>Discipline.</HI> For <HI>Dis|cipline</HI>
well managed settles Reformation.</P>
<P>3. That the fittest and onely men who still
have, and alwayes should reforme Churches
by good <HI>Discipline,</HI> are Bishops, for they
<PB N="310" REF="155">
have both power and discretion.</P>
<P>4. That good examples are of admirable ope|ration;
for doth it not easily appeare, that
by the wisedome of this one Reverend Bishop,
how all the other Churches strive to follow his
patterne? It is an old one, yet a true saying,
<HI>Exempla mag&igrave;s praevalent quam praecepta,</HI> Ex|amples
make a deeper stampe than precepts.</P>
<P>In briefe, the two first of these well conside|red,
our Zelots would not so much speake a|gainst
such good meanes, unlesse they bee igno|rant.
The third, well observed, would teach
all to afford those reverend Prelates more ho|nour,
and to learne the fifth Commandement
better, and to practice that rule of Saint <HI>Paul,
Let such as rule well have double honour;</HI> they
would not surely, if they had any insight into
the <HI>Primitive</HI> Times, so rashly and unchristian|ly
murther their spirituall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Bishops.</NOTE> Fathers, nor yet
so deeply wound their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Church.</NOTE> Mother, by Scandals,
Slanders, Reproaches, <HI>Schismes, Factions,</HI>
Fractions, <HI>Conventicles, Libells,</HI> and the like
hasty hare-brain'd fancies. The last will direct|ly
condemne them, for not obeying and follow|ing
such ancient and allowed Fathers: But I
will not insist upon this, though it doth faire|ly
offer it selfe to mee, but returne to our Fa|ther
<HI>Chrysostome,</HI> as he hath begun a faire Refor|mation
in the Church.</P>
<P>Having so fairely wrought upon these Chur|ches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Niceph. l. 1. c. 3</NOTE>
he proceeds further; he settles the Chur|ches
likewise in <HI>Phaenice,</HI> though addicted to
<PB N="311" REF="155">
Idolatry; nay, though they worshipped De|vils,
and gatherd together all the Priests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zozom. l. 8. c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> and
settle them to study <HI>Piety:</HI> and send thither
the Emperours Edicts (obtained by him for
that purpose) to demolish and throw dow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
the Images of the Idols, and to ruine their
Temples; and as for the Officers and worke|men
which should effect this great taske, hee
payed them not out of the Emperours Coffers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrat. l. 6. c. 3</NOTE>
but stir'd up the spirits of noble Matrons,
whom he had instructed in the Faith, and flow|ing
in wealth, to give large summes of money
to this purpose, assuring them that it was a
worthy worke, to cast out the Devill by this
meanes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodor. l. 5. cap. 29.</NOTE> and this his Counsel was so powerful,
and wrought so effectually, that in short space
he left the Devil not an house to put his head
in, but level'd them to the ground.</P>
<P>And this able Enginiere left not off thus, but
proceeds further: when as hee perceived the
whole Nation of the <HI>Scythians</HI> to bee deepely
intangled and insnared in the <HI>Arrian</HI> Heresie, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o
expell this and the professors of it, he took this
course; he ordeined many Priests and Deacons,
that could speake the Tongue expertly, and
placed them in several Churches, and ap|poynted
likewise Readers; and thus hee by his
care, reduced many that were farre gone with
that <HI>Heresie,</HI> to the Orthodox Faith: and often
hee himselfe would give those Churches visits,
and speake to them learnedly by an Interpre|ter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Niceph. l. 13. c. 3, 4.</NOTE>
and still inducted others who had a faculty
<PB N="312" REF="156">
that way:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zozom. l. 8. c. 6</NOTE> and thus as in <HI>Phaenicia</HI> he had expel|led
the Devil, so in <HI>Scythia</HI> hee drove out his
Champions and strongest upholders.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrat. l. 6. c. 3</NOTE></P>
<P>And now finding in these his undertakings
such an happy successe, hee being incouraged
in his vertuous proceedings stops not here, but
stoutly workes whilst hee sees an opportunity:
which was as followes.</P>
<P>Hearing for certain that those <HI>Scythians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodor. l. 5. cap. 31.</NOTE> who
are called <HI>Nomades,</HI> living by the River <HI>Ister,</HI>
eagerly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hirsted after the knowledge of the
truth, and yet did want all meanes which should
direct them to the knowledge of Christ: being
as those Children spoken of, who cryed for
bread, but there was none to give it them,
This Saint <HI>Chrysostome</HI> (sorrowing that the De|vill
should keepe their soules in the shadow of
darknesse any longer) sought diligently farre
and neare for such men as imitated the foote|steps
of the <HI>Apostles</HI> labours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Socra. l. 6. c. 3.</NOTE> and having found
them, sent them to bring those wilde people to
the knowledge of the Gospell; and sent his Let|ters
with all speed to <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ontius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zozom. l. 8. c. 6</NOTE> then Bishop of
<HI>Ancyra,</HI> wherein he signified, that the <HI>Scythi|ans</HI>
had embraced the Truth, and exhorted him
to send able men to them, to confirme them
in the received Faith: furthermore, having
heard of the <HI>Marcionists,</HI> who had about his ju|risdiction
infected some people with their He|resie,
to stay this running soare, hee dispatched
Letters to the Bishop of the same place, that
He should carefully expell all of them out of
<PB N="313" REF="156">
their places, and for feare least hee should either
want helpe or courage to effect his desires, hee
sent him the Emperours Edicts, obtained for
this purpose, to encourage him in it: so by these
his noble actions, the case is cleare, that he (as a|nother
St. <HI>Paul)</HI> had a great care of the Chur|ches
welfare, unity, and prosperity. Indeed a
wise man will order and square his actions
and thoughts by divine Lawes; for by that
meanes he shall be sure to be blessed.</P>
<P>I must not let passe in silence another notable

<GAP DESC="foreign">, A <HI>Scythian</HI> by Nati|on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodor. lib. 5 cap. 32.</NOTE>
of a <HI>Barbarous</HI> minde, full of Insolency,

in warre, and ruled not onely over the Ar|my
of his owne Nation, but over certaine
Troopes of <HI>Roman</HI> Horse-men, and some
Regiments of Foote-forces, whom not onely
most men feared, but even the Emperour
himselfe, (knowing his bloody disposition)
mainly suspected.</P>
<P>This wicked <HI>Gainas</HI> desires of the Empe|rour,
that hee and his might have a Temple
allowed them, (he being mainly affected with
<HI>Arianisme:)</HI> The Emperour for the pre|sent
told him, hee would thinke of it, and
<PB N="314" REF="157">
at last promised him one: But the Emperour
calling this Divine <HI>Iohn Chrysostome</HI> to him,

Withall the Emperour informed him of his

so thought it best by yielding to his desire to
asswage his high swolne pride. To whom this

promise it to him, neither may you give ho|ly

that those, who prayse <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Word</HI> with ho|linesse

not to feare the power or Malice of that
<HI>Barbarian,</HI> but call me and him together
into one place, and be pleased with silence to
heare mee speake to him; for I perswade my

Emperour was glad to heare this good Father
to say thus much, and the next day hee caused
them both to meete. <HI>Gainas</HI> hee laies claime
to the Emperours promise;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Niceph. l. 12. cap. 45.</NOTE> <HI>Chrysostome</HI> an|swers
him, that it was not fit for the Empe|rour
rashly to attempt any thing against sacred

would have a <HI>Temple; Iohn Chrysostome</HI> reply|ed,

I who have performed such and so many ex|ployts

this priviledge: To whom Saint <HI>Chrysostome</HI>
againe answered, the rewards bestowed upon
you for your <HI>Service,</HI> hath not onely equalled,
but exceeded your labours; for you are made a
<HI>Commander,</HI> and have attained to a <HI>Consular</HI>

<P>I have beene abroad pacifying stormes and

to enquire of his life when he was young; but
finding nothing worth objecting, they then sent
to <HI>Theophilus</HI> to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and set his malice
on working, who was glad at such an occasion:
but they found accusation against him for that
Sermon which he preached, out of 3 <HI>Kings</HI> 18
for they alleaged that what he said against <HI>Baals</HI>
priests was meant of them: and what he spoke
of <HI>Iezabel,</HI> he meant of <HI>Eudoxia:</HI> Thus <HI>Chryso|stome</HI>
was beset with the malice of the Empresse,

not our tongue only.</P>
<P>Hee calls the life of man a Faire or Market,
where some are seeking for gaine and profit; o|thers
for pleasure and delight: others for prayer
and devotion: and the last of these are those
that walke as children of light.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Chrysostome</HI> calls Saint <HI>Paul</HI> the tongue
and Teacher of the whole World, who lived like
an <HI>Angell</HI> on earth; and now enjoyes a crowne
in Heaven.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Chrysostome</HI> gives man the reason why
the <HI>Angels</HI> did not bring the tydings of our <HI>Sa|viours</HI>
birth first to <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Princes,</HI> or other
great men, aswell as to the poore <HI>Shepherds:</HI>
And this is it, because, saith hee, great mens
eares were so stopped with <HI>cares</HI> and <HI>honours,</HI>
that they have no pleasure to heare it; or
<PB N="324" REF="162">
would not take so much pains themselves: but
sent their servants.</P>
<P>His Works are here registred, He departed in
the thiriteenth of <HI>Arcadius</HI> and <HI>Honorius,</HI> Hee
was made Bishop in the fourth of <HI>Arcadius,</HI> and

<P>_IN describing this Fathers life, I fol|low
not any uncertaine Relations,
but I follow the method of <HI>Possi|donius,</HI>
who in writing the passa|ges
of his life saith, such things, <HI>quae in eodem
vidi ab eodemque audivi,</HI> which I saw in him,
and heard from him, two sure witnesses, the
eyes and the eares; and therefore may for succe|ding
times be easily admitted for truth.</P>
<P>This <HI>Augustine</HI> therefore was an <HI>African</HI> by
birth, borne in the City of <HI>Thagasta,</HI> of pi|ous
and Christian Parents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide in Possid. in vita Au|gust.</NOTE> bred and nourished
by their care and diligence, and singularly well
learned and approved for skill in the Liberall
<PB N="323" REF="163">
Arts, for he taught Grammar in his owne City,
and Rhetorique in the head City <HI>Carthage;</HI> and
after going over sea, he came to <HI>Rome,</HI> and so
to <HI>Millaine,</HI> where hee was appoynted to in|struct
the Emperour <HI>Valentinian,</HI> being the
fifth of that name, and the Bishop, at the
same time of that City being that worthy Pre|late
Saint <HI>Ambrose,</HI> whose sermons to the peo|ple,
and publicke disputations this <HI>Augustine</HI>
did attentively heare and like of. He was living
in <HI>Carthage,</HI> tainted with the Pestilent Heresie
of the <HI>Manichees,</HI> but by the providence of God
and the wisedome of Saint <HI>Ambrose,</HI> his heart
was enlightned, &amp; so he was brought safe from
that Rocke, was confirmed in the faith, and a
little before <HI>Easter,</HI> did receive the Doctrine
of the Catholick Church, and also Baptisme,
by the ever honoured Father Saint <HI>Ambrose,</HI> and
being in this state so fairely recovered, he set his
heart wholly and intirely to seeke the Lord, and
to leave the world, not now regarding honors,
wealth, or riches, but sought diligently heaven|ly
treasures, striving with might and maine to
be one of that little flocke of whom it is said,
<HI>Feare not little flocke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 12.</NOTE> <HI>it is your Fathers good
will to give you the Kingdome:</HI> Hee was about
thirty yeares old when hee thus beganne, ha|ving
onely his mother <HI>Monica</HI> alive, who did
mainly rejoyce to see him so intirely converted:
His Father called <HI>Patricius</HI> was dead before, and
now also he left his Scholars whom hee taught
Rhetorique, and told them they should pro|vide
<PB N="324" REF="164">
themselves another Master, for hee would
onely serve the Lord.</P>
<P>It pleased him, being baptized, to goe and
live in <HI>Affricke</HI> with other faithfull Christians;
where, when hee was come, how speedily did
he performe what he had resolved? for leaving
all secular affaires, how constant was hee in
Watching, Fastings, and Prayers? and those
graces which it did please God to give him,
how did he imploy them? so that by his Ser|mons
and Bookes he taught those that were ab|sent,
as well as those that were present; for hee
converted one to the faith in a short time.</P>
<P>At the same time one <HI>Valerius</HI> was Bishop of
<HI>Hippo,</HI> and having a great care to provide able
men to teach the people, he, with the peoples
great desire, ordained this <HI>Augustine</HI> a <HI>Priest,</HI>
and being entred into that holy function, hee
did strive to grace the Gospell by an holy Life.
This <HI>Valerius</HI> ordained him being banish|ed.
This <HI>Augustine</HI> did powerfully preach the
Word, and had great conflicts with <HI>Fortunatus</HI>
a defender of the <HI>Manichees;</HI> who was appoin|ted
to meete <HI>Augustine</HI> in a publicke place,
and to dispute with him, which with a great
deale of feare he did undertake, but was quite
foiled, and so by Gods blessing and the consent
of all the learned men, the <HI>Manichees</HI> fell, and
sincere <HI>Religion</HI> was maintained in the City of
<HI>Hippo.</HI></P>
<P>He also preached and writ with singular care
and dextrous learning against the <HI>Affrican</HI>
<PB N="325" REF="164">
Heretiques, as the <HI>Donatists, Manichees,</HI> and
<HI>Pelagians:</HI> so that by his writings the <HI>Affrican</HI>
Churches did recover the ancient Truth: and
he was so able and powerfull in the Scriptures,
that the very Heretiques were forced to con|fesse
him a Divine Man. He was appoynted by
the Bishop to dispute of <HI>Faith,</HI> which hee did,
with the approbation of all: but this good old
man <HI>Valerius,</HI> finding him so rarely qualified,
sent to the Primate of <HI>Carthage,</HI> and certified
him that he was so old and weake, and the
charge was so great to manage, and this <HI>Augu|stine</HI>
was so learned and pious a man, that hee
intreated him to bee ordained Bishop of that
City: so that <HI>Megalius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Calama,</HI> and
Primate of <HI>Numidia,</HI> comming to visit the
Church of <HI>Hippo</HI> with other Bishops, this <HI>Va|lerius</HI>
did obtaine of his hands what he desired,
with the generall rejoycing of all the Clergy;
though Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> did mainly at first refuse
it, and alledged it was not fitting, neither was
it the custome of the Church to ordaine any
to be Bishop of a City, before the other was
dead: but it was imposed upon him: and so be|ing
ordained, hee doubled his vigilance, and
not onely in that City, but in every place hee
taught and writ against the <HI>Donatists.</HI> There
was a sect of perverse and desperate people, who
under the colour of great continence were cal|led
<HI>Circumcellians,</HI> who being not able to
withstand the Writings, nor Preachings, nor
Disputations of this <HI>Augustine,</HI> they did by
<PB N="326" REF="165">
might and violence, and force of Armes strive
to stop Saint <HI>Augustines</HI> proceedings&punc; but all
their Actions were in vaine: for G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d did still
prosper and blesse the labours of this <HI>Augustine;</HI>
for he ordaind Orthodox <HI>Priests,</HI> men approved
and well knowne to him for Life and Learning,
and did give them promotion in the Church;
so that the sincere Doctrine of <HI>Faith, Hope,</HI>
and <HI>Charity</HI> was not onely taught in the <HI>Affri|can</HI>
Churches, but also in other Transmarin
Regions; Books being printed and sent abroad,
which made these Heretiques rage; insomuch,
that they intended to have killed this Saint <HI>Au|gustine,</HI>
had hee not by the great providence
of God escaped, by missing that way in his Vi|sitations
which they had beset: but such was
their fury and power, that they neither spared
Clergy men nor Lay men: but there was a mee|ting
at <HI>Carthage</HI> appoynted, and one <HI>Crispinus</HI>
was the <HI>Donatists</HI> Champion; against whom
Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> opposed himselfe, who did
by force of arguments convince this <HI>Crispinus;</HI>
and so by the <HI>Proconsuls</HI> authority hee was ad|judged
as Hereticall, and a fine imposed upon
him: and further it was ordered, that all the
<HI>Donatists</HI> should be accounted Heretiques and
fined; but by the Catholike Bishops perswasi|ons,
with the clemency of the <HI>Proconsull</HI> their
fine was remitted, and peace restored happily
to the <HI>Church,</HI> under the Reigne of that glori|ous
Emperour <HI>Honorius,</HI> though there were
some that gave out, that the <HI>Donatists</HI> were
<PB N="327" REF="165">
unjustly condemned by the Bishops at the mee|ting
at <HI>Carthage,</HI> because they had not (as these
favourers pretended) free liberty to speak their
mindes: Especially one <HI>Emeritus</HI> maintained
this; but not long after this, Saint <HI>Augustine</HI>
going to the City of <HI>Caesarea</HI> in <HI>Mauritania,</HI> be|ing
sent for by other Bishops by Letters, to de|termine
some necessary affaires of the <HI>Church,</HI>
this <HI>Emeritus</HI> being then a <HI>Donatist,</HI> and Bishop
of the said place, Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> told him that
he had so given it out, and wished him now be|fore
all those Bishops and all the people, if
he could, to defend his assertions, but he would
not, nor could not performe it, onely said, that
what he should say: would bee by the Notaries
Registred at <HI>Carthage:</HI> what a poore evasion
was this? for if it had beene, truth it was the
onely way to preserve it; if it was a lye, as in|deede
it was, it would for ever bee his dis|grace.</P>
<P><HI>Possidonius</HI> reports an admirable passage of
Saint <HI>Augustine;</HI> it so fell out, that preaching
against the <HI>Manichees,</HI> that there was one <HI>Fir|mus</HI>
by name, a Merchant by profession, who
was stiffe for that side, and had given and spent
amongst them much monies, hearing Saint
<HI>Augustine</HI> preach, was touched in heart, and
presently came to this Father (other men being
then with him) and did ingenuously confesse
that he was infected a long time with that He|resie:
but by the <HI>blessing</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> hee was fully
resolved now to forsake it, and with teares on
<PB N="328" REF="166">
his knees, he desired Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI> and the
other Catholicke Priests, to pray to God to
pardon him, and to give him grace to persist
in the true <HI>Faith,</HI> which was performed, and
he reduced from Heresie, and leaving his for|mer
course of life, and living with the faithfull
obediently, at last proved an eminent <HI>Preacher</HI>
of the <HI>Orthodoxe Christians,</HI> and not onely sa|ved
his owne soule, but many others: <HI>See</HI> (saith
<HI>Possidonius) the wonderfull goodnesse of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Possid. in vit. August.</NOTE> <HI>that
calls whom he will; whom he will, where he will,
and how he will to salvation.</HI> God, as he is <HI>Al|mighty,</HI>
so may he worke in all creatures and
things after his owne <HI>Minde</HI> and <HI>Will:</HI> for
there is nothing that <HI>God</HI> cannot bring to passe,
and that without labour and travaile. It was
Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> by the preaching of the <HI>Word,</HI>
which caused the <HI>Merchant</HI> to forsake all, and
cleave to the <HI>Truth;</HI> but it was chiefely the
<HI>power</HI> of <HI>God</HI> which had that <HI>efficacy</HI> in that
<HI>Word;</HI> that by one knocke at the doore of the
<HI>heart</HI> of this man, that it should open and re|ceive
the <HI>seale</HI> and <HI>covenant</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> which he
did without any prorogation or delay, or time
to consider of it: for in these cases delayes are
dangerous, for the devill, the world, or the
Flesh may cast a baite in our way, and so hinder
us. Therefore let all men in this be truely per|swaded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Exhorta|tion.</NOTE>
that <HI>God</HI> is the <HI>Moderator</HI> and <HI>Gover|nour</HI>
of all things both in heaven and in earth;
and that all things are done by <HI>his owne power,</HI>
and appoyntment: and that he it is, who most
<PB N="329" REF="166">
clearely beholdeth every man, both what hee
doth, and what he admitteth in himselfe, with
what minde and <HI>godlinesse</HI> he doth <HI>love</HI> and <HI>fa|vour</HI>
Religion; and that hee hath also a regard
both of godly and wicked men.</P>
<P>So likewise one <HI>Foelix</HI> being one whom the
<HI>Manichees</HI> called <HI>Electos,</HI> came to <HI>Hippo,</HI> and
thought to have spread his Heresie there, but
Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> by publicke <HI>Disputation</HI> so so|lidly
convinced him, that he likewise acknow|ledged
his error, and was joyned to the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Augustine</HI> was termed <HI>Haereticorum mal|leus,</HI>
the Hammer against Heretiques: How
judiciously did hee overcome those two great
<HI>Arrians, Pascentius,</HI> and <HI>Maximinus,</HI> the one
being full of wealth and authority at Court, the
other a great Bishop? <HI>Pascentius,</HI> who was great
in Riches, disturbed many poorer Christians,
and boasted in it, that none could object any
thing justly against the <HI>Arrians.</HI> St. <HI>Augustine</HI>
hearing this, with other Priests went to him,
and desired to have some private conference
with him, before they should publickly dis|pute
it; this <HI>Pascentius</HI> admitted, but hee was
quite overthrowne, and had no warrant for
his poynts; but afterwards bragged it, how he
had confuted this <HI>Augustine:</HI> whereupon St.
<HI>Augustine</HI> with speed sent in writing, many
great men being witnesses, the grounds of
<HI>Faith</HI> confirmed by the <HI>Scriptures</HI> to him,
which he never did replie against: so also dealt
he with <HI>Maximinus</HI> the <HI>Arian</HI> Bishop, who
<PB N="328" REF="167">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="329" REF="167">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="330" REF="168">
had belyed him in the like manner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pelagians</HI> likewise politique and subtle
<HI>Sophisters</HI> who did seduce many, and did great
mischiefe to the <HI>Church,</HI> how did hee the space
of tenne yeares convince and overthrow? that
afterwards it was determined by <HI>Innocent</HI>
of <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Zozimus,</HI> that their poynts
should be anathematized, and sent Letters to
the Churches of <HI>Affrick</HI> to condemne them as
Heretiques, and that pious Emperour <HI>Hono|rius</HI>
confirmed their Religious proceedings
and adjudged them Heretiques: so many of
them returned to the bosome of the Church a|gaine,
and dyed in the <HI>Faith:</HI> Alwayes great
was the care of St. <HI>Augustine</HI> for the good of
<HI>Religion,</HI> not onely in <HI>Hippo,</HI> but in other
parts of <HI>Affricke,</HI> and not onely against Here|tiques,
but also in winning <HI>Pagans</HI> to imbrace
the <HI>Truth.</HI> He was just in all his Counsels, espe|cially
hee would determine according to the
<HI>Truth:</HI> Hee was not onely learned, but also
ready to instruct, and to take off differences: he
would not spare likewise to reprove wisely and
seasonably the sinners, admonishing them to
obedience, and <HI>Christian Devotion:</HI> so that as
<HI>Possidonius</HI> reports it, <HI>He may worthily be called
a Watchman to the house of</HI> Israel, <HI>to the Church
of God, preaching the Word in season, out of sea|son,
exhorting, instructing, rebuking, with
all long suffering,</HI> Hee was excellent for deci|ding
temporall causes, and very circumspect
to relieve the party wronged: how divinely
<PB N="331" REF="168">
did he write to <HI>Macedonius,</HI> a Priest of <HI>Affricke</HI>
and granted his desire. As hee had liberty, hee
would be present at the meetings of the holy
Priests, celebrated through diverse Provinces,
not seeking those things which were his; but
doing all for the glory of God; doing as Saint
<HI>Paul</HI> writes to the <HI>Corinthians, not seeking yours,
but you:</HI> taking care, that the faith of the holy
<HI>Catholicke</HI> Church should remaine unviolated,
and that unworthy men should be punished: in
ordaining <HI>Priests,</HI> he would alwayes follow the
custome of the Church, and the generall con|sent
of Orthodox Christians: For his apparell,
it was neither too sumptuous nor sordid, kee|ping
a faire mediocrity; saying, that many were
puft up with pride by the riches of their Gar|ments,
and so did fall into sinne: Hee kept a
spare dyet, and frugall, being Broth and Roots;
sometimes for his guests he would have flesh, or
for the weake and sicke folkes: He alwaies kept
Wine, alledging that of the Apostle, <HI>Every
creature of God is good, and not to bee rejected,
being sanctified by the word and prayer:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 10. cap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> And as
hee speaks in his <HI>Confessions,</HI> Hee did not so
much feare the uncleannesse of his meate, as the
uncleannesse of his desires: and useth many fine
examples out of Gods Word to prove it: his
Utensils in which his meat was brought to
table were either earthen or wood, or Marble:
His Table was rather for disputation and dis|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">urse,
than for any rich Banquetting, or drin|king,
and it had this Distich ingraven on it.</P>
<Q><PB N="332" REF="169">
<L>Quisquis amat dictis absentum rodere vitam,</L>
<L>Hanc mensam indignam noverit esse sibi.</L></Q>
<P>That is,
<Q><L>Who shal their absent friends with words disgrace,</L>
<L>Are guests unworthy of this roome, or place.</L></Q></P>
<P>And therefore he would tell them that were
faulty this way, that either those Verses were to
be blotted out, or else he to depart. Hee was e|ver
mindfull of the poore, and would, either
out of the revenues of the Church, or out of the
offerings of the faithfull, distribute to their ne|cessities:
His House was a Church: Hee never
bought land. <HI>Possidonius</HI> speakes, that there
was an Honourable man of <HI>Hippo,</HI> living at
<HI>Carthage,</HI> would give his possession to the
Church, an act used in those <HI>Primitive</HI> times,
(now it is out of use) and caused it to bee past
under Seale, and sent it to Saint <HI>Augustine:</HI>
but a few yeares after hee changed his minde,
and sent his Son to desire the deeds to be rever|sed,
and in liew of it his Father had sent to
the poore an hundred shillings. St. <HI>Augustine</HI>
was sorry that the man should so suddenly bee
weary of well-doing; but withall restored to
his Son the Acts, and withall did rebuke him
sharply, and bad him take heed that God did
not punish his proceedings. He did not regard
wealth, but counted it combersome, and there|fore
did as <HI>Mary</HI> did, chuse the better part: Up|on
a time he wanted monies to release some pri|soners
<PB N="333" REF="169">
and Captives, and caused the holy Ves|sells
to be melted and given for their freedome.
Saint <HI>Ambrose</HI> saith, that in such cases it may
bee permitted: He alwayes kept Divines in his
house, whom he fed and cloathed: hee was
wondrous severe against <HI>Oathes,</HI> so that hee
abated their portion and allowance that did
commit it. He never did admit women in his
house, no not those of his kindred; Hee never
entertained discourse alone with any, but had
some still with him. In his Visitations hee
kept the rule of the Apostle, he relieved the
<HI>Fatherlesse and Widowes in their distresse:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ian. 1. ult</NOTE> <HI>if they
entreated him to pray to God for them, and lay
his hands on them, hee would presently doe it:</HI> He
praised one, who when hee was sicke, said
to those that stood about, I have not lived so,
that I am ashamed to live with you; nor doe I
feare to dye, having so good a Lord to goe to.
This Father before his death recounted strictly
all his Books, and those which he writ when he
was not experienced in the affaires of the
Church, which would not agree with the
Church, hee himselfe corrected and reproved:
and hee writ two Volumes which carry this
Title, <HI>De recensione Librorum,</HI> which are his
Bookes of <HI>Retractations:</HI> hee complained that
some of his Books were taken away before they
were well mended; some he left imperfect, being
prevented by death: Hee writ a Booke called
the <HI>Speculum,</HI> in which any one that reades it
may find either his obedience, or disobedience
<PB N="334" REF="170">
towards <HI>God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Patrick a|bout this time began to convert the Irish to Chri|stianitie.</NOTE> Hee lived in the time of that bar|barous
invasion of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> out of
<HI>Spain,</HI> into <HI>Africk</HI> and <HI>Mauritania,</HI> in which
were Cities &amp; Churches, Monasteries laid wast,
Virgins defloured, Matrons abused, the Altars
puld down, the Priests slain, the faithfull hiding
themselves in Holes, Dennes, and Caves: Hee
saw almost innumerable Churches destroyed,
onely three escapt their out-rage, <HI>Carthage,
Hippo,</HI> and <HI>Cirtis;</HI> yet after his death <HI>Hippo</HI> was
burn'd; it was besieged fourteen moneths. Saint
<HI>Augustine</HI> and all the faithfull did pray God ei|ther
to free the Citie, or give them patience to
endure, or to take him out of this life, which
last came to passe, for in the third month of the
siege he fell sicke of a <HI>Fever</HI> and died, hee healed
one possessed of a Devill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gift of God given to man.</NOTE> and by prayer dispos|sest
him. Hee healed one readie to die by laying
his hands upon him, whereupon they said, if
any was sicke, <HI>Vade ad</HI> AUGUSTINUM,
That is, Goe to Saint AUGUSTINE, and
you will recover: hee writ an Epistle to <HI>Hono|ratus</HI>
his fellow Bishop, who desired to know
whether they might not fly in those dangerous

<HI>Epistles,</HI> wherein he declares largely his mind in
this point. Hee lived to the age of 76 yeeres,
hee continued Priest and Bishop almost forty
yeeres, hee dyed wondrous penitent, and had
<HI>Davids</HI> penitentiall psalmes before him which
hee constantly read, and would weepe: hee suf|fered
none to come to him, but at such times as
<PB N="335" REF="170">
the Physitians came with refections for him:
ten days before his death and all that while hee
prayed fervently: at the time of his death his
sight and hearing were good, and divers priests
being present, and praying with him, he depar|ted
this life in fulnesse of days, and gave order
to them for his buriall, and so offered himself as
a sacrifice to God: hee made no Will at all, but
gave order that his Library and all his Bookes
should be safely reserved to posterity for the

who they esteemed highly, and reverenced for
his sanctitie and holinesse of life: but chiefly
<PB N="338" REF="176">
because this <HI>Cyrill</HI> was a generall <HI>Scholer,</HI> and
one well qualified with all temporall vertues:
much adoe there was on both sides, yet at three

conducted to the Episcopall Chaire with grea|ter

not so much as once remember this <HI>great Father</HI>

<PB N="339" REF="176">
that the Great Cardinall <HI>Baronius</HI> would con|demne
that Tenet, if there had been but proba|bilitie
of truth in it, it making for their cause.</P>
<P>But to proceed, this famous <HI>Cyrill</HI> was so ad|mired
for his singular piety, eloquence, and wit
(that <HI>Gennadius</HI> reports) that the <HI>Grecian Bishops</HI>
got some of his <HI>Homilies</HI> by heart, and so reci|ted
them to the people with wonderfull delight
and approbation; and truly besides many other
things which are reported of him to his praise,
let this also be one, that <HI>Iohn</HI> the third King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> gives him; when as hee was sent into
<HI>England</HI> by his brother <HI>Ericus,</HI> then King;
When the Commentaries of Saint <HI>Cyrill</HI>
upon the holy Gospell of Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> were
delivered to his hands, and hee had read them,
hee plainly and ingenuously confest, that many
new Writers had much swayed him, but now,
<HI>sordescere coeperunt, &amp; postea illos, ut novos de|testabatur,</HI>
that all were farre short: nay, in re|spect
of this one man, hee detested all new Wri|ters:
and to speak truth, as I do verily think, one
mayne reason why Factions and Schismes have
such great growth of late, is, because most of our
younger wits, and hottest Preachers doe not tie
themselves to the reading of the <HI>Primitive Fa|thers,</HI>
but slightly content themselves &amp; others,
with conversing onely with some few <HI>Geneva</HI>
Writers of late; or think to carry it away with
the strength of their owne braine: by which
meanes, many of them know but the shell of
Theologie: when as (if my advise might take

their Synagogues, where some of them were

being thus removed, hee looked more
neare home, by reducing those Christians that
were any way dissolute, into better order, by
information of the simple, by comforting
the afflicted, and by relieving the poore and

people upon severall occasions.</P>
<P>This, and much more (not unlike a Ship in

<P>And here I can but observe two passages,

at all times strive to destroy the Church of

in <HI>France,</HI> sprung from Parents,
who are commended for their up|rightnesse
and sincerity, not of meane or de|jected
fortunes, but having ability of meanes to
support them with credit and reputation: and
they are prayse-worthy for their great care that
they had to see their sonne vertuously brought
up in study and good Arts.</P>
<P>This <HI>Chrysologus</HI> had institution for good
manners and learning, from <HI>Cornelius,</HI> who was
Bishop of that City: so likewise from the same
Bishop he received holy Orders, and was found
<PB N="353" REF="183">
wondrous able for that holy function; inso|much,
as not long after, hee was by <HI>Sixtus</HI> the
third of <HI>Rome,</HI> chosen to bee Arch-bishop of
<HI>Ravenna,</HI> and was the two and twentieth that
had successively managed the affaires of that
Sea. Hee deserves high commendation for his
rare parts, and indefatigable paines, and va|rious
studies. Hee was present at two Coun|cels,
the one was held at <HI>Ravenna,</HI> the other
at <HI>Rome,</HI> by the authority of <HI>Caelius Symma|chus,</HI>
then Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Theodori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ns,</HI>
King of the <HI>Ostrogoths.</HI> He sent Letters full of
learning to the Synod of <HI>Calcedon</HI> against <HI>Eu|tiches</HI>
the Heretique, which are yet extant; but
what a copiousnesse of wit he did enjoy, may
easily be perceived: as also what a measure of
Eloquence he possessed, by the number of his
Homilies and Sermons full of Elegancy and
matter, being above 176. He sate Bishop the
space of sixty yeares, and governed the Church
of God with admirable wisedome and industry.
<HI>Trithemius</HI> amongst his Ecclesiasticall Writers,
speakes thus of this <HI>Chrysologus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trithem. de Scrip. Eccles.</NOTE> <HI>Petrus Archie|piscopus

performed many worthy actions in the
Church of Christ.</P>
<P>He was so powerfull in Eloquence, especi|ally
in his Sermons to the people, and so holy
in his conversation, that he by both these did
daily bring some to the imbracing the truth,

and did set forth many rare pieces <HI>pro edificati|on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
fidelium,</HI> that is, for the edification of the
Faithfull. You have this Father sufficiently
commended for his excellent parts in an Epistle
set before his Workes, which were printed at
<HI>Paris</HI> with the Workes of <HI>Leo</HI> the Great, the
first of that name, Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> as also of
<HI>Maximus,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Taurinum,</HI> and <HI>Ful|gentius</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Ruspa,</HI> with the Workes also
of <HI>Valerianus,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Cemelium</HI> in one Vo|lume,
where this <HI>Chrysologus</HI> is commended
with these words, <HI>En tibi</HI> Chrysologum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
that is, behold this <HI>Chrysologus,</HI> not onely fa|mous
for his Divine Eloquence, and solidity of
Learning, but also for his honour'd antiqui|ty,
and faithfulnesse in the Episcopall functi|on.
He lived within a while after Saint <HI>Chryso|stome,</HI>
and other famous pillars of the Church.
He got this name as <HI>Chrysostom</HI> got his; for he
is termed of all <HI>Divines</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is, the
<HI>Golden spoken man;</HI> for who wil but reade his
<HI>Workes,</HI> shal finde a lofty Majesty of stile and
phrase, absolute and profound Learning, such
purity of Divinity, not stained or tainted with
any vaine affectation, nor any rigid and harsh
Interpretation, no obsolete <HI>deductions,</HI> or <HI>con|clusions,</HI>
but direct and even Natural: so that if
you compare <HI>Neotericks,</HI> either <HI>Commentators,</HI>
or as my Author speakes <GAP DESC="foreign">, that is,
Homily Writers with this man, you shall finde
them as <HI>Pigmies</HI> to another <HI>Atlas,</HI> for where
have you a more modest Interpreter of the
<PB N="355" REF="184">
sacred Scriptures? Where can you finde one
so conspicuous for pious Eloquence, or
Eloquent PIETIE? Who opens the most
obscure places of the Text with a more apt,
consonant, ingenuous sincere interpretation?
so that he doth not wrest the sence, nor corrupt
it, nor unfitly expound it, but with judgement,
integrity, exact Learning and industry, so that
in these respects, hee doth well deserve to bee
ranked with the most eminent Fathers, he doth
not rashly or childishly heape together a few
places of Scripture, but doth (where the place
or matter wants testimony) wisely and discreet|ly
exhibit his proofs for confirmation. As hee
was studious in his preachings, so always before
he pend any thing he would with great arden|cie,
and humilitie set himselfe to prayer. Car|dinall
<HI>Baronius</HI> in his Annalls doth commend
this <HI>Petrus Chrysologus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Card. Baron. Tom. 6. p. 88. 89.</NOTE> for his Epistle writ to

words, <HI>Tristis legi tristes literas tuas,</HI> with grief

of the Priests, the tranquillitie of the com|mon
people makes our joy to abound, so no

of such causes deeply afflict and torment us: oh

c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nfesse him to be a God, though at that
time laid in a Cratch; by presenting their My|sticall
presents: the Priests do acknowledge him
that should be borne of a <HI>Virgin, the heavenly
Army of Angels sing at his Nativitie, Glory to
God in the Highest:</HI> And when as at the Name
<HI>of</HI> JESUS <HI>every knee should bow, both of things
in heaven, in earth, and under the earth,</HI> what a
strangenesse is it, that your pen should move a
question of his beginning, we do (Beloved) with
the blessed Apostle safely conclude, that though
we have knowne <HI>Iesus</HI> after the flesh, yet now
know wee him no more, nor is it safe to search
too farre, when as wee are commanded to ho|nour
and feare him. It is not the wisest course to
gaze too much upon this resplendent Sun, lest
we be justly by his glorious beams beblinded; it

this Epistle to judge what a singular man for

saith, that having with great pains long gover|ned
the Church; and having beene always stu|dious
of his wayes, hee died in <HI>December,</HI> the

Bishop of <HI>Rhegium</HI> in <HI>Gaule.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Card. Bellar. de scrip. Eccles. pag. 98.</NOTE> Cardinall <HI>Bellar|mine</HI>
doth in his <HI>Ecclesiasticall Writers,</HI> suspect
the former opinion, as not consonant to truth,
and gives two reasons for his assertion; for hee
<PB N="364" REF="189">
finds Saint <HI>Prosper</HI> to have subscribed to the <HI>Va|sensian</HI>
and <HI>Carpeuctorete</HI> Provinciall Councell,
which are in <HI>Gaule,</HI> not <HI>Italy:</HI> so that hence it is
probable, he was Bishop in a Province of <HI>Gaule:</HI>
Moreover, Saint <HI>Faustus</HI> succeeded St. <HI>Prosper</HI>
in his Bishoprick: now all have concluded <HI>Fau|stus</HI>
to bee a <HI>French</HI> Bishop, not an <HI>Italian,</HI> and
that his Diocesse was subject to the Metropoli|tan
of <HI>Aquitain,</HI> not to <HI>Ravenna:</HI> but I will not
insist upon this. Hee was in his time famous for
his learned and judicious Writings, and shewed
himselfe to bee a true Scholer to so great a Ma|ster
as Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> was: For Hee, aswell as
his Master, had learnedly confuted and over|thrown
the dangerous Heresie of the <HI>Pelagians,</HI>
and as <HI>Iohannes Antonius Flaminius</HI> of <HI>Imola,</HI>
who writes his Life, saith, that hee was Bishop
of <HI>Rhegium, Vir multiplici doctrina &amp; sanctita|te
insignis:</HI> A man eminent for his sanctitie and
multiplicitie of Learning: but in what place,
or of what parents hee was borne, <HI>non satis
compertum habemus,</HI> wee have not sufficiently
knowne: but it doth appeare to all, <HI>Aquitanum
fuisse,</HI> That he was of <HI>Aquitaine;</HI> but while he
lived in his Countrey, he did lay a sure founda|tion,
that in after times hee would be a shining
Lampe in the House of God: for hee was assi|duous
in reading, and most conversant in the
Scriptures, and usually had the foure <HI>Evangelists</HI>
in his hands, in which meditating, it was by <HI>di|vine
providence</HI> so ordered, that He should me|ditate
upon that place of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> where it
<PB N="365" REF="189">
is said, <HI>If thou wilt be perfect, goe and sell all
that thou hast, and give it to the poore, and come
and follow me,</HI> which place of <HI>holy Writ,</HI> Hee
did so strictly apply unto himselfe, that willing,
not to be onely a Reader, but a devout practiti|oner
of Gods Word, He presently without any
delay, put this in practice, and made sale of all
his Lands and Goods, and distributed them
freely to the poore members of his Saviour,
that so being disburthened of his earthly estate,
hee might the more easily and comfortably fol|low
his Saviour, to get an heavenly inheritance
which will never fade, but is everlasting. So set|ting
his servants free both men and maids, and
yielding them a competencie to live on, he went
to <HI>Rome,</HI> that he might see the <HI>servants</HI> of <HI>God</HI>
in that famous City; At the same time that
most holy and sweetly eloquent Bishop <HI>Leo</HI> rul'd
that Church, who hearing of the comming of
such an excellent man as this <HI>Prosper</HI> was, left
not till hee had got him into his houshold, and
it is not to be conceivd with what humanity
and curtesie, and with what joy and rejoycing he
received this Jewell, as sent to him by Gods spe|ciall
Blessing: so highly was piety and learning e|steemed
in those dayes, though much slighted in
these looser times: this learned <HI>Leo</HI> rejoyced at
the approach of <HI>Prosper,</HI> even as Saint <HI>Peter</HI> is
said to have done at Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> comming, for
amongst other things <HI>Leo</HI> did perceive what an
able Engine <HI>God</HI> had sent him to oppose that
<HI>Heresie</HI> of <HI>Eutyches,</HI> which holds but one na|ture
<PB N="366" REF="190">
in Christ, which every day began more and
more to take root in severall places; but espe|cially
in the Citie of <HI>Chalcedon:</HI> to overthrow
which <HI>Leo</HI> afterwards sent this <HI>Prosper</HI> with ma|ny
other <HI>Roman Clergie men:</HI> Such cares there
alwayes hath beene in the Governours of the
<HI>Church,</HI> to keep down <HI>Heresies</HI> and <HI>Schismes,</HI> and
were it not for the vigilancie and dexterous
Learning of <HI>Pious Governours,</HI> and <HI>Reverend
Bishops,</HI> how soone would obstinate <HI>Here|ticks</HI>
and <HI>hot-spirited Schismaticks</HI> overthrow
the grounds of <HI>Divinity</HI> and order of the
<HI>Church?</HI></P>
<P>These pious men being sent by <HI>Leo,</HI> unani|mously
maintaind the <HI>Nice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Creed,</HI> and did lear|nedly
and divinely by infallible arguments de|fend
the two natures, and took away the afore|said
Heresie, and by their hand writing sent to
<HI>Martianus</HI> the Emperour, with full consent con|demned
the said author <HI>Eutyches</HI> as an <HI>Heretike.</HI>
So this <HI>Prosper</HI> being overcome by the prayers
of this good <HI>Leo,</HI> stayed there a good while, and
when he had struck off the heads of many <HI>Here|sies,</HI>
by sending to divers <HI>Churches</HI> his learned
<HI>Epistles, Leo</HI> being inwardly warned by <HI>Gods
Spirit,</HI> made him (though for his part with a
great deale of reluctancie) Bishop of <HI>Rhegium,</HI>
for he said his shoulders were not able to under|goe
such a burthen: But <HI>Prosper</HI> being over|come,
he took his journey, and the former Bi|shop
being worne out with age, and troubled
with a grievous disease, gave up his spirit into
<PB N="367" REF="190">
the hands of God: for the losse of which good
man, the whole City did grieve exceedingly:
but suddenly their mourning was turned into
joy, for the old Bishop before his death willed
them not to grieve for his death: for said hee,
<HI>God in especiall love to you, and the Bishop of</HI>
Rome, <HI>out of his care hath provided you another
man to succeede me,</HI> &agrave; Deoelectum, <HI>Chosen of God,
famous for holinesse of life, and ability of judge|ment,
who is now comming to you.</HI> Which words
comforted them exceedingly; for when the
same of his comming had extended it selfe to
the gates of their City, all the Citizens went
out to give him honorable entertainment. Such
reverence in ancient times did men give, even
to the persons of their <HI>spirituall Rulers.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus (with the generall acclamations
of all men) called to be their Bishop, and seated
in his Episcopall Chaire, that he might give
them a testimony of his parts, and what a
worthy Light he would bee to his charge, his
Speech which he made to them doth sufficient|ly
expresse, which doth begin in these words;
<HI>Video, Fratres Charissimi, quantum meis imbecil|libus
humeris onus impositum fuerit&punc; &amp;c.</HI> that
is, (which for the sweetnesse both of stile and
matter I have translated) I see, (deare brethren)
what a great burthen will be put upon my weak
shoulders: For can there be a greater than the
charge of mens soules? and that which makes
it the weightier, is the expectation of men, who
looke for things to be performed by us, even
<PB N="368" REF="191">
beyond mans ability; or at least such gifts a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
are given but to few: for is it not a difficulty to
turne mens judgements? to alter their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">etled
opinions? and even now I see plainly, that
such is the expectation of men: Wherfore I
plainly see, that I must omit nothing which
doth any wayes belong to the care of soules.
But knowing the burthen will bee the lighter
if it be laid upon many mens backs, I entreate
you (oh my beloved sonnes) to partake some
part of the burthen with mee. Which you doe,
if you will (remembring your owne salvation)
keepe Gods Commandements, and live in u|nity
and godly love; from which, as from a most
plentifull Fountaine, will flow out abundantly
wonderfull vertues, <HI>viz.</HI> Humility, mutuall
love, setled peace and concord; which vertues,
if they doe as they should do, abide and abound
in you, Christ will be alwayes amongst you, and
all things will have good successe. This is it
(as I said before) to divide the burthen with
me, and so hee divinely goes on, exhorting
them to have God in all their thoughts: these
are the things (said he) that I thought fit to ad|monish
you of at my entrance.</P>
<P>This was a faire demonstration what a wor|thy
Bishop hee would bee to them: His speciall
care was to take away all strifes and contenti|ons
from amongst them: and therefore in his
speeches to them still commended peace and u|nity,
which were so full of native and genuine
Eloquence, and strengthned by Gods Word,
<PB N="369" REF="191">
and his beautifull Life, that they tooke <HI>deeply,</HI>
and did work <HI>powerfully;</HI> for what he said, that
he did: his Heart was adorned with charity, his
countenance was composed of meeknesse: Hee
was wondrous affable, hee was temperately
severe: What a care had he of the poore? How
did hee support poore <HI>Orphans</HI> and <HI>Widowes?</HI>
Was he not a Father to all <HI>Ages, Sexes, Orders,</HI>
that were in that City? how carefull in his Ser|mons
to excite men not onely to heare, but al|so
to worke out their salvation? How watch|full
was hee in his Episcopall charge, lest the
Devill should cause any of his flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters"> to goe a|stray?
What admonitions gave he to his Cler|gy?
and lest while hee preached unto others,
he himselfe should be a cast away: how did hee
addict himselfe to watching, fasting, prayer,
and Meditation? Did hee not likewise send
Letters to other Bishops, his fellow-labourers,
to entreat them not to forget their charge?
which actions and deportments as they did de|serve
love, so they did gaine him the love and
reverence of all about him: He sate Bishop two
and twenty yeers in <HI>Rhegium,</HI> unto the 466. yeer
of Christ. He flourished chiefly under <HI>Leo</HI> the 1:
Having done his work so well, so long a time in
the Church, the time of his dissolution came, and
he fell sicke and dyed: But before he yielded up
the Ghost, he called divers unto him, and made
a heavenly speech unto them, all weeping for
the feare of losing so good a Bishop, and so wor|thy
a Father: It begins <HI>Video, dilectissimi, &amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="370" REF="192">
I see, most dearely beloved, how you all grieve,
and I wonder not, for it is hard for true lovers
to part without teares, but you must beare it,
for to have stayed longer here, might seem bet|ter
for you, for me it is better to bee dissolved,
and to be with Christ. Consider that mans life
is weake and fraile, heaped with many froward
and troublesome businesses, providing things
needful to save his body from misery and want;
for the life that I have enjoyed was but given
me upon condition, to render it againe, not
grudgingly, but gladly, and with a cheerefull
heart; for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters">th is the onely easement of all our
trouble and anguish: the longer I live, the lon|ger
I live in sinne; the more time I spend, the
more I erre and goe astray, each houre purcha|sing
to my selfe a new paine and punishment:
For it is not the man which liveth longest, but
he that liveth justly and vertuously shall attaine
the promise and reward of heaven. Hee it is,
that is worthy to be honoured and lamented of
all good men: and so divinely goes on, certify|ing
them of the resurrection to glory, and en|treating
them to live in love, and keep peace
unbroken.</P>
<P>These dying words melted them into teares;
for what can make sooner or deeper compas|sion
into ones heart, than to heare the dying
words of a good man? So after Psalmes and
Hymnes sung by his friends, he praying lifted
up his hands to God in the sight of them all, and
departed. His Corps with the Citizens and
<PB N="371" REF="192">
all his Priests was with great pompe interred in
the Church, which hee had consecrated to the
honour of God and the blessed Saint <HI>Apollina|ris;</HI>
hee dyed the eighth of the Calends of <HI>Iuly,

<P>_THere is amongst Ecclesiasticall Wri|ters
mention made of two of this
name, the one was Bishop of <HI>Vtricu|lanum,</HI>
memorable for his holinesse
and sincerity of life, and flourished under the
reigne of <HI>Totila,</HI> King of the <HI>Gothes, Iustinian</HI>
being Emperour, and <HI>Vigilius</HI> Pope. Saint
<HI>Gregory</HI> in his third booke of <HI>Dialogues,</HI> in
his twelfth Chapter describes him compleatly.
This is he, who was one of those two hundred
Bishops; which King <HI>Trasamund,</HI> King of the
<HI>Vandals,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Rom. Pon. in hist. Sym. hist. Miscel. l. 15.</NOTE> sent bound into the Island of <HI>Sardinia,</HI>
to whom <HI>Symmachus</HI> the Pope sent sufficient
daily provision. This was equall in Holinesse
<PB N="377" REF="195">
and Learning, if not excelling the other. This
famous <HI>Fulgentius,</HI> whose life I describe, was
an <HI>Affrican</HI> by birth, sprung of noble Parents,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o much the more honoured, because they
were Christians: His Grand-fathers name was
<HI>Gordianus,</HI> a Senator of <HI>Carthage,</HI> and it fell
out so, when <HI>Gensericus</HI> was King of the <HI>Van|dals,</HI>
that this <HI>Gordianus,</HI> with divers other
Noble-men, and Counsellours, were expulsed
<HI>Carthage,</HI> and stript of all their meanes and re|venues.
Upon this, <HI>Gordianus</HI> sailed into <HI>Italy,</HI>
for feare, that as hee was cashier'd from his E|state,
so likewise he should lose his liberty, if
not his life; where dying, two of his sonnes re|turned
into their Country, and obtained some
part of their fathers inheritance; where, one of
them, called <HI>Claudius</HI> by his wife <HI>Mariana,</HI> an
honest Matron in the Towne of <HI>Leptis,</HI> had
born unto him this worthy <HI>Fulgentius:</HI> but his
Father dying, committed the care of his little
sonne to his Wife, which with great care
brought him up both to the knowledge of
the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greeke</HI> tongues, wherein he pro|ved
most excellent and expert.</P>
<P>Being young he is commendable for his obe|dience
to his Mother: so that she committed the
charge of her House to his circumspection; and
in this charge Hee shewed such an example of
modesty, obedience, and diligence, that as one
speakes of him, hee was <HI>Matri praesidium, do|mesticis
solatium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reibadei <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> vit.

<PB N="378" REF="196">
a comfort to the family, to those without, with
whom he conversed, a rare example.</HI></P>
<P>But God had laid and appoynted him out
for higher imployments, and so stirred up and
enlightned his understanding, that Hee knew
and shunned worldly delights and vaine plea|sures
and profits, and so left the company of
young men, and gave himselfe to prayer, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a|stings,
watchings, and reading, and meditation.
So having exercised himselfe in these duties, he
goes to a certaine Reverend Bishop called <HI>Fau|stus,</HI>
and humbly prayed him to admit him
into his Cloyster, and afford him a religious
habit: The Bishop at first doubting whether he
was fit to be admitted or not, because hee was
but young, tender, rich, and noble, and there|fore
not yet able to undergoe that strict course
of life, telling him, how that before he did re|solve
of it, to take a tryall and surveigh of his
owne strength, and seriously bethinke himselfe
of that charge which he went about to embrace,
seeing usually that many doe presume too much
upon their owne power, and many times at|tempt
more than their ability are fit to under|goe:
But at last noting well his eagernesse, and
hoping well of his constancy and continuance,
he yielded to his request.</P>
<P>But as soone as it was knowne that <HI>Fulgenti|us</HI>
had undertaken this state of life, all good
men rejoyced, and bad men fretted: nay, his ve|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y
mother in all haste comes to recall him, and
disswade him from it, fearing that shee should
<PB N="379" REF="196">
lose much by this departure from her she cryed,
complained, and grieved deeply, but her sonne
would not alter, and indeed she gained well by
this his departure, for hee gave himselfe wholly
to vertue and holinesse of life. His diet was
spare, and hee tooke no Refectories to please his
palate, he subjugated his flesh, so that with this
abstinence, he fell into a deep sicknesse, and yet
during his disease, hee kept the same strictnesse
of diet, saying, that this sicknesse proceeded
from the hands of God, and that it was for his
good, which so fell out, for he speedily recove|red.
He gave his Heritage to his mother, not
to his younger brother <HI>Claudius,</HI> lest it should
make him too proud, and because he should give
the more respect to his Mother during life.</P>
<P>About this time the Devill raised up a great
storme of persecution against the <HI>Catholike Chri|stians</HI>
by <HI>Thrasimund</HI> King of the <HI>Vandals,</HI> in
which the good old Bishop <HI>Faustus</HI> was driven
from his government, and this <HI>Fulgentius</HI> also
from this Cell: but he got into another, where
one <HI>Felix</HI> ruled, here he shewed admirable parts
of modestie and temperance. But the <HI>Barba|rians</HI>
entring this Countrey with violence of
armes, this <HI>Fulgentius</HI> and <HI>Felix</HI> consulting for
their safeties fled from their places, but fell into
the hands of the <HI>Arrians,</HI> who were more in|humane
and cruell then those <HI>Barbarians.</HI> For
it happened&punc; while they stayed at <HI>Barbadilia,</HI>
one <HI>Felix</HI> an <HI>Arrian</HI> Priest, being a cruell perse|cutor
of Orthodoxe <HI>Christians,</HI> tried all plots
<PB N="380" REF="197">
how to apprehend this <HI>Fulgentius</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">elix,</HI>
and having misused some by shaving them, and
sending them away naked from their lodgings,
he so displeased the Bishop of <HI>Carthage,</HI> though
an <HI>Arrian,</HI> that hee prosessed he would punish
that Priest if <HI>Fulgentius</HI> would accuse him, for
this fact: but this good man would not accuse
him, lest hee might seeme to revenge his owne
wrongs, saying, <HI>plura pro Christo toleranda:</HI>
That he ought to suffer more then so for Christ.
Well, he resolves to retur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e into his owne coun|try,
hoping to finde more mercy amongst the
<HI>Barbarians</HI> then amongst the <HI>Arrians,</HI> so going
for <HI>Sicily,</HI> hee was driven into <HI>Syracuse,</HI> where
he was kindly entertained by an old Bishop cald
<HI>Eulalius,</HI> and by one <HI>Ruffinianus,</HI> who were fled
from the <HI>Arrians:</HI> so past he to <HI>Rome,</HI> and so in|to
<HI>Sardinia,</HI> where hee was received with great
joy. Here having setled himselfe, there resorted
to his Cell great store of Christians, whom he
daily taught and instructed; but he intended to
lead a more private life, but hee was forbidden
by <HI>Faustus</HI> a Bishop, who made him priest, and
not long after made him Bishop of <HI>Ruspa,</HI> a
great and populous Citie, though <HI>Fulgentius</HI>
was unwilling to accept this great preferment:
being thus invested, he kept his ancient <HI>Humili|tie,
Pietie,</HI> and <HI>Constanci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> but was the same in the
height of <HI>Honour,</HI> as he was in the deepest ebbe
of <HI>Adversitie:</HI> and where so many graces as <HI>hu|militie,</HI>
&amp;c. are connext with <HI>meditation,</HI> they
give an edge unto the soule, and make it un|pierceable
<PB N="381" REF="197">
as steel, hardly to endure the sharpest
point of envie.</P>
<P>Hee was much addicted to studie, for hee
would rise in the night to reade and pray: hee
obtained ground of one <HI>Posthumianus</HI> a Noble
man, to build a place for Religious Monks. But
now <HI>Thrasimund</HI> King of the <HI>Vandals</HI> proscri|bed
all the Orthodoxe Bishops: and so this <HI>Ful|gentius</HI>
was banished with the rest: where what
good he did, is easily seene, for he resolved all
doubts, relieved the poore, reconcil'd the diffe|rences
of many, made friendship between those
that were at difference, reduc'd those that were
fallen into sinne, gave instructions to some, en|couragements
to others: none wanted that
good, that he could supply with all.</P>
<P>At the same time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apud. Euod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">&punc; Ticinensem. p. 318.</NOTE> <HI>Symmachus</HI> was <HI>Pope,</HI> who
hearing the wasting of the <HI>African</HI> Churches,
sent provision to these <HI>Fathers</HI> that were fled,
and a worthy Epistle of <HI>Comfort,</HI> which begins
thus, <HI>Ad vos specialiter dictum est, Nolite timere
pusillus Grex, &amp;c.</HI> to you it is specially spoken,
<HI>Feare not little flocke, it is your Fathers good plea|sure
to give you the Kingdome.</HI></P>
<P>But now <HI>Thrasimund</HI> the King dealing poli|tikely
intending to overthrow the Church Or|thodoxe,
made as though hee was turned Or|thodox
himselfe, and so he seemd to desire to
have some eminent and Orthodox fathers by
him to resolve all doubts and questions, and so
hearing of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ame and learning of <HI>Fulgentius,</HI>
hee sent for him to come to him to instruct him:
<PB N="382" REF="198">
whither when <HI>Fulgentius</HI> was come, he effected
much, and converted many <HI>Arians</HI> to the Faith,
And writ a booke of the <HI>Trinitie,</HI> which was so
soundly and judiciously written, that it asto|nished
the <HI>King;</HI> and yet by wicked Councels
hee did command him to returne by night to
<HI>Sardinia,</HI> lest the people should mutinere: but
yet it pleased God by contrary windes to bring
him i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> again into Harbour, by which meanes all
the people did lend him prayers and prayses, and
wept for his departure: and great numbers went
along with him; but not long after, <HI>Thrasimund</HI>
dying, <HI>Hildericus</HI> succeeded him, who recal|led
the banished Bishops, and restored them
to their places: but this <HI>Fulgentius,</HI> of them all
is said to be, <HI>Decus, Ornamentum, Corona:</HI> the
Grace, Ornament, and Crowne: Here he refor|med
many abuses in the <HI>Clergie,</HI> gathered
together the scattered flock, was highly hono|red

<P>He had an admirable dexterity in preaching,
and was powerfull in convincing, and reverend
in his carriage. In the time of his sicknesse, this
was his familiar speech, <HI>Da Deus mi, hic patien|tiam,

patience, and then pardon and mercy: falling
sicke, he lay so forty dayes, and calling the Cler|gie

them to stand in the same, hee quietly gave his
soule into his Creatours hands, in the yeere
529, and of his Bishopricke the five and twen|tieth,

<P>This man was singular for parts and Arts;
when his parents were dead he builded sixe Mo|nasteries
in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and one within the Walls
of <HI>Rome,</HI> and laid as much meanes to them as
was sufficient for their maintenance, and what
was over-plus, He sold and gave it to the poore;

<HI>Gregory,</HI> famous for learning and the expla|nation

<P>In his Homilies, especially those to the peo|ple,

I must not let slip what is recorded of him by
<HI>Photius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Photii biblio p. 1398. &amp; Sy|meon Metaphr.</NOTE> and <HI>Simeon Metaphrastes.</HI> On a time
there came to him a poore man, who made his
mone to him, that he had endured ship-wracke
at sea, and had lost all his goods; insomuch, that
he had not any thing to relieve himselfe nor his
family withall. <HI>Gregory</HI> presently moved with
compassion, gives him forthwith six Ducats: So
he having received them departs; and yet the
same day returnes to this <HI>blessed Father,</HI> and
told him, his necessity was so great, that what
he had received, hee had payed away, and so
desires some more of him: Saint <HI>Gregory</HI> gives
him other sixe Ducats: well, hee the same day
came the third time, and desired reliefe, which
was given him without gain-saying by this <HI>Fa|ther</HI>
proportionably: but this poore man com|ming
the fourth time, and <HI>Gregory</HI> having no
more gold to give, yet unwilling to send him
away empty, hee remembred he had a piece of
Plate in his House of a good value, and present|ly
commanded that to be given, and it was per|formed
according to his desire. Here was com|passion,
that was beyond the bounds of a com|mon
man, foure times in one day, and of the
same party to crave, and at every request to
receive a reward, without reluctancy or repi|ning.
Here was Charity and Liberality bestow|ed
the right way: for whom perverse Fortune,
long sicknesse, threats and oppressors have
<PB N="393" REF="203">
brought unto poverty, to those let men ex|tend
forth their compassion and charity. This
Saint <HI>Gregory</HI> by the wisedome of God so dis|posing
it for his admirable endowments, being
made, as I have said before, Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI>
by the suffrages of all good men: it was a cu|stome,
that upon the first day of his enjoying
that preferment, there should twelve poore
men be called in to dine with him: so hee that
was chiefe over-seer that way, did, as was in|joyned
him. Well, this father being sate with
these twelve, he presently counting them recko|ned
thirteene, and asking his Officer why hee
had transgressed the custome, hee presently re|plyed
that there were but twelve; but <HI>Gregory</HI>
affirmed there were thirteene; so looking well
upon them, he saw one of their Countenances
often change and to shine: so after dinner hee
tooke the thirteenth into his study, and serious|ly
demanded of him who hee was: he replyed,
that he was the poore man, which hee foure
times in one day so bountifully relieved with
gold and plate; which almes-deeds (saith he) of
yours are so well-pleasing to God, that I am
sent (being an Angell) to you, to preserve your
life, and to direct you in your studies. At which
words, Saint <HI>Gregory</HI> was strucke with feare:
but the Angel vanished immediately, and Saint
<HI>Gregory</HI> fell devoutly to prayers, and gave God
thanks for his great favour shewed to him.
Here I may say as it is of <HI>Cornelius, Act. 10.
Thy prayers and thy Almes-deeds are come up be|fore</HI>

me, and I wonder where can we finde such
a pattern of Charitie in these dayes; Rich men
doe debar themselves of many a great blessing,
for not exercising themselves in Almesdeeds (as

many have received Angels, so did Abraham and
Lot.</HI> But I will not insist longer upon this.</P>
<P>Now I will proceed, This <HI>Gregory</HI> was of
that acutenesse of wit, that he easily overthrew
<HI>Eutyches</HI> the <HI>Heretike</HI> in a publicke disputation
concerning the resurrection, and did so confirme
it, that the Emperour caused <HI>Eutyches</HI> his books
to bee burned as <HI>hereticall,</HI> as you may see and
reade in his Workes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 4. Moral. c. 29. Beda l. 2. c. 1. Hist. Angl.</NOTE> as also in <HI>Beda.</HI> Read
<HI>Iohannes Diaconus</HI> in the life of this <HI>Gregory</HI> in
his first book, and foure and twentieth Chapter,
where hee shall finde with what solid places of
Scriptures, and invincible arguments hee doth
establish it. When as the plague did rage so fu|riously
in <HI>Rome,</HI> that the living could scarce bu|ry
the dead, and when <HI>Pelagius</HI> was dead of it,
how worthily did this <HI>Gregory</HI> behave himselfe
during that heavy visitation and judgment? how
did he stirre up the hearts of the people with all
speed to turn to God with fasting &amp; prayer, and
by serious and unfained repentance? What an
elegant speech did hee make unto them is easily
to be seen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. Diacon. in vit. S. Greg. c. 41. l. 1.</NOTE> it is so full of piety and wisdome that
it deserves to be registred in Letters of Gold,
and is able to make the hardest heart to weepe
and lament his sins, and to set himselfe to seeke
<PB N="395" REF="204">
the Lord. How powerfully did he by dextrous
Counsels establish the Churches? How did he
cause the <HI>Ligurians,</HI> the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI>
to be drawn from Schismes, and to embrace the
authority of the <HI>Chalcedon</HI> Councell? How did
he reduce the <HI>African Churches</HI> from the Heresie
of the <HI>Donatists? Sicily</HI> from that of the <HI>Ma|nichees?
Spaine</HI> from that of <HI>Arianisme? Alex|andria</HI>
from that of the <HI>Agnoetans,</HI> by his deep
learning and judgment? And did hee not like|wise
free <HI>France</HI> from <HI>Symoniacks,</HI> which did
grow up in every place? Did hee not so power|fully
prevail with <HI>Brunichilda</HI> the Queen, with
<HI>Theodoricke</HI> and <HI>Theodobert</HI> Kings of <HI>France,</HI>
that he procured from them a generall Councell
against these persons, and anathematized all that
should dare to practise that sin? Yet in these He|roick
proceedings, the Devill did all he could to
oppose him by calumniation, but he left not off
to proceed, maugre all their malicious conclusi|ons,
to effect that good to the <HI>Church of God,</HI>
for which he thought he was set up: how <HI>Chri|stianlike</HI>
did he speake to the Emperour <HI>Mauri|tius</HI>
against his making that unjust Law, that
none of those souldiers which were marked in
the hand should ever be converted to the <HI>faith</HI>
of <HI>Christ:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohan. Diacon. in vit. <HI>S.</HI> Greg. l. 3. c. 50.</NOTE> Did not this <HI>Gregory</HI> answer the Em|perour

a world of troubles governed the

in the spight of all oppositions, he died quietly

<P>_HE was by birth a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> of good and
honest parents, such was their conditi|on,
that they had alwayes an especiall
care in the educating of this their young sonne,
in vertue in his youth, that hee might bee the

For many teach their children the liberall
Sciences, not because those Sciences may give
any vertue, but because they make the minde
apt to receive any impression of vertue: for ma|ny
mens children be divers and of sundry con|ditions:
some bee of nature not prompt and
forward, wherefore by education they must
thereunto bee formed. This <HI>Isidore</HI> was of a
<PB N="407" REF="210">
quick wit, and of an able memory (pointed out
by heaven) in so much that he was admired and
respected of all for his Learning and Eloquence:
And being come to yeeres, and taken notice of
by the Bishop (who then sate in that See) and o|ther
learned men, gained much love and respect
from them for his constancie, descent, and pie|tie;
whereupon hee was called to bee a Priest:

and was so generally eloquent, that hee could
accommodate the quality of his speech fitly to
discourse with the Ignorant or Learned. His
works were most famous for humane and di|vine
Learning, he was of a subtle, sharpe wit, a
cleere apprehension, and a composed speech, ex|cellent
in verse and prose, shining with the re|fulgent
beams of sanctity and learning, so that
all those naturall gifts which lie scattered in o|thers,
were in him collected into one subject. He
was called the younger, to distinguish him from
the <HI>senior</HI> Bishop of <HI>Corduba,</HI> or from another
Bishop of <HI>Siuill</HI> his predecessor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Epist. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> When he per|ceived

the poore for six moneths together, so that they
tarried all day to receive his charity: afterward
his sicknesse increasing, and his stomack through
weaknesse refusing all kind of sustenance, he de|sired
to make his reconciliation with God by
prayer publikely, and amongst the Congrega|tion:
and so was carried to S. <HI>Vincents</HI> Church,
where hee confessed himselfe and said, <HI>Thou, &ocirc;
God, which knowest the hearts of men; and didst
forgive the poore Publican that stood afarre off,
and knocked his owne brest, who on the fourth day
didst raise dead</HI> Lazarus <HI>from the grave, and
wouldst have him received into</HI> Abrahams <HI>bo|some,
receive at this houre my confession, and re|move

done: remember not, &ocirc; Lord, the sins of my youth;
and because thou sayest,</HI> Quod in quacunque ho|ra

thy gracious promise, I call unto thee with hope
and confidence, being in regard of my sinnes un|worthy
to looke up unto Heaven: but, &ocirc; Lord, I
beseech thee, receive my prayer, and pardon mee a
sinner. For if the Heavens bee not pure in thy
sight, much more am I impure, who have drunke
iniquitie like water:</HI> Then hee asked pardon of
the Clergie and Citizens, saying, I beseech the
whole Congregation of the <HI>Clergie,</HI> and people
here present to pray unto the <HI>Lord</HI> for me a wic|ked
sinner, that I who am through my own me|rit

<P>_THis Venerable <HI>Bede</HI> was a <HI>Benedictine</HI>
Monke, of the Monastery of Saint
<HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> in <HI>England:</HI> He was
an <HI>English Saxon,</HI> borne in the yeare

P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pe: Hee was deprived of both his pa|rents,
when he was but seven yeares old: Hee
was delivered into the Monastery of Saint <HI>Peter</HI>
and <HI>Paul</HI> by the care of his Neighbours, and
was brought up there under <HI>Benedict</HI> and <HI>Ceal|frid</HI>
then Abbots, and men famous for Piety
and learning; where in short space hee shewed
what parts he had gained by vertuous educati|on
in his youth; for he was a man most studious
<PB N="416" REF="215">
in the holy scriptures, and wondrously learned,
skilfull in all secular occasions; a great Philoso|pher,
Astronomer, Musitian, and Poet, skilfull
in the Greek Tongue, a mellifluous Rhetorici|an,
Arithmetician, and a famous Divine. Hee
practised these three things himselfe, and taught
others to doe so too. O rare! <HI>scribere &amp; do|cere,</HI>
to pray, to write, to preach: at nineteene
yeares of his age, he was by <HI>Ceolfrids</HI> appoynt|ment
ordained a Deacon, <HI>Sergius</HI> the third be|ing
then Pope, and at thirty he was ordained
Priest; from which time hee wholly devoted
himselfe to the study of the sacred Scriptures in
meditation and interpretation of them; for he
speakes so much of himselfe in the end of the
History of <HI>England,</HI> in these words, <HI>Beda Dei
famulus &amp; Presbyter Monasterii Apostolor. Petri
&amp; Pauli, quod est ad Wirimudam &amp; Ingiruam,
&amp;c. omnem meditandis scripturis operam dedi.</HI></P>
<P>Hee was sent for to <HI>Rome</HI> by Pope <HI>Sergius,</HI>
that he might discourse with him, <HI>Bede</HI> being
so famous in all parts for his vertues and sci|ence.
The Epistle of that Pope is to be seene in
the third Tome of the generall Councells, and
begins in these words, <HI>Opportunis ergo, &amp;c.</HI> the
subject of it was, that there was a great need of
the advice of learned Divines to settle&punc; the
Churches peace, and he was knowne to be able
in the study of Theology, and therefore was de|sired
to repaire to <HI>Rome</HI> with all convenient
speed; but it is concluded by the best Historians,
that he stirred not out of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="215">
He was wonderfully modest, and did never
hunt after preferments, but contented him|selfe
with that life and daily study: in his rea|dings
oftentimes he was so devout, that hee
would shed teares abundantly: and after he had
done reading, he would fall to prayers; for he
would say, that prayer was of great force to
get the true understanding of Gods Word. O
famous instrument to Gods glory! who not
onely was fervent in his prayers, but exceeding|ly
both by life and learning, edified the Church
of Christ.</P>
<P>Hee hated idlenesse, and would say, hee
thought there was so much worke to doe for a
Divine in so little a space of time, that hee
ought not to lose any of it; it is imployment
keeps the soule safe and sound. He did not begin
to take this taske upon him when the Sun was
setting, in his old age; or begin to live when he
should dye: no, he offered God his youth, and
began in the strength and prime of his age. He
was a Bee in his owne hive; he dressed his own
Garden; hee managed his owne affaires, for|getting
all desire of honour and riches, which
bringeth with it miserable and stupendious ef|fects.
And for pleasure and delights of the
World, we must deale with it (saith hee) as men
doe who buy and taste honey, onely touch it
with the tip of the finger, not with our whole
hand, for feare of surfeit. He had many famous
Schollars, which he provoked to study by his
owne example; in a word, he was full of know|ledge,
<PB N="418" REF="216">
charity, devotion, and chastity.</P>
<P>For his person, he was of a comely stature,
grave in his going, of a lofty voyce, pleasant of
speech, comely of countenance, and pleasant|ly
severe.</P>
<P>Being aged 59 yeares, in the yeare of Grace
731 he finished the Catalogue of his Workes;
but it is not on all parts resolved justly what
yeare he dyed in. <HI>Marianus Scotus</HI> saith in the
yeare of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r Lord 729. <HI>Sigebertus</HI> saith in the
yeare 731. <HI>Trithemius</HI> saith in the yeare 733.
Some have much erred, who say that he dyed in
the yeare 700: but <HI>Baronius</HI> he approves them
not. How he departed this life, is to be seene
by an Epistle of one of his Scholars, who af|ter
great commendations of him for piety,
learning, patience, and the like, saith, <HI>Grava|tus
infirmitate anhelitus,</HI> hardnesse of breathing
a little after Ascention day, hee was sicke of it,
and had a tumor in his feet: in his sicknesse hee
was not any whit disturbed to appearance, but
would often exhort his Scholars to bee quicke
in gathering notes from him: for hee had not
long to stay with them. For my life (said hee)
is uncertaine at the best; and that man which
goeth on wandring without any faith or con|stancy,
feedeth his thoughts and cogitations
with vapour: no man knoweth what will hap|pen
in time to come; howbeit God governeth
all men in the midst of all perills and dangers:
and many times on the contrary hee bloweth
upon us a strong winde, or tempest of adversity:
<PB N="419" REF="216">
And that life is good, and best to be esteemed,
which is led in honesty and vertue; for at the
day of death it will trie it selfe: for the day
of death is the Master and judge of all other
dayes, being the tryall and touch-stone of all
the actions of our life: then doe wee make our
greatest assay, and gather the whole fruit of all
our studies: and he that judgeth of the life of
a man, must looke how he carrieth himselfe at
his death: for the end crowneth the workes,
and a good death honourerh a mans whole life.</P>
<P>There was a young man one <HI>Witberch,</HI> that
spoke to him and said; Loving Master, there is
something left to write; to which he answered
and said it was finished, and so cald him to hold
his head, and then singing <HI>Gloria Patri, Filio,
&amp; Spiritui Sancto,</HI> with cheerefulnesse he brea|ted
out his Spirit, and slept in the Lord. Many
famous men have praised him as <HI>Hildwines,</HI> and
<HI>Marianus Scotus: Albinus Flaccus</HI> termes him,
<HI>Eximium Doctorem,</HI> and <HI>Amalarius</HI> calls him
Venerable, according to that Verse.</P>
<Q>Hic sunt infossa Bedae venerabilis ossa.</Q>

him, <HI>sagacissimum scripturarum Indagatorem.</HI></P>

<P>_IT is no small comfort to proceed
from the loines of worthy Proge|nitors,
when not onely wee are ena|bled
by our owne vertues, but also
made the more conspicuous by our parents. In
this respect, this worthy <HI>Father</HI> challengeth a
double honour, for hee was not onely well de|scended
from parents of worth and pietie, but
also was himselfe a grace to them and the place
of his Nativity. Hee was borne in <HI>Damascus</HI> a
City well knowne, if it were but for that very
one cause that is registred in holy Writte, and
was as it is to be read in the ninth of the <HI>Acts</HI> of
the Apostles, a place of refuge for the persecuted
<PB N="425" REF="219">
Saints which fled from <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> &amp; were pro|secuted
by <HI>Saul,</HI> who was converted in his jour|ney
to this place; for his parents, though they
lived in dangerous times, and in the midst of
barbarous people, yet they as <HI>Lilies</HI> among
thornes retained their beauty and integrity, not
losing their piety in the midst of a perverse ge|neration,
and when the <HI>Agarens</HI> subjected that
City by the sword, and used cruelty towards the
<HI>Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">ans,</HI> yet these worthy <HI>paire</HI> (by Gods pro|vidence)
were preserved, (as it might seeme) to
produce to the World this their son, nay, their
very enemies admired their constancie, and gave
them reverence: and as God who kept <HI>Daniel</HI>
among the <HI>Assyrians,</HI> though a captive, yet made
him a Ruler and a Commander, and likewise
<HI>Ioseph,</HI> though sold and imprisoned, yet was by
the same providence set up a chiefe Ruler in the
midst of his <HI>adversaries:</HI> so likewise did God
give this <HI>Damascens</HI> Father such credit and re|spect,
that even those <HI>Saracens</HI> made him for his
worth and conspicuous piety, <HI>Administrator</HI> of
their publick and most weighty affaires, and he
is called, <HI>Vt lucerna in nocte, signum in monte,
scintilla in cinere:</HI> that is, As a Lanthorne in a
night, as a Beacon on a Hill, as a spark amongst
ashes, as a Diamond among dust for his justice
and integritie: and what he got in wealth by his
Offices, he did with liberall hands distribute, in
the reliefe of captives in slavery, nay, hee gave
his estate and land which was a great quantitie
in <HI>Iudea</HI> and <HI>Palaestine,</HI> to the maintenance of
<PB N="426" REF="220">
the poore Christians in bondage, and his Father
by his purse did not redeeme so many from cap|tivity,
as his sonne did from the snares and sla|very
of the Devill; this <HI>Damascens</HI> father had a
speciall care, that assoon as his sonne was borne,
he should be christened, and made a member of
the <HI>Christian Church;</HI> a dangerous thing in those
times, when to be but suspected to be a <HI>Christian</HI>
was matter enough of bonds or death. Hee
likewise had an especiall care to his education,
which is commendable in parents, and chose
him a Master, not a man of the sword, but emi|nent
for austerity and holinesse of life; and it
fell out thus: It was the custome of the <HI>Barba|rians,</HI>
in ships and boats to rove about, and to
take prisoners, and often they brought <HI>Chri|stians</HI>
with them, whom they inslaved, or put to
the sword, or made sale of them: and bringing
in many, amongst the rest there was an ancient
old man an <HI>Italian</HI> in an <HI>Hermits</HI> habit, of a
comely gracious aspect, called <HI>Cosmas:</HI> they that
were put to the sword gave great respect to this
man, so that the <HI>Barbarians</HI> seeing the <HI>Christi|ans</HI>
so to reverence him, conceived him to bee
some great man, and demanded of him what he
was, he answered, hee was a poore, old, unpro|fitable
man; and thereupon wept, onely he was a
<HI>Philosopher,</HI> as he confest, which <HI>Damasecns</HI> Fa|ther
standing by and hearing him, and seeing
him weepe, asked him why he wept? Who told
him it was because he had gain'd the knowledge
in all the liberall <HI>Arts,</HI> but as yet he had not bred
<PB N="427" REF="220">
up any in the same knowledge: whereupon
this <HI>Damascens</HI> Father presently went to the
Captaine, and humbly on his knees begd him
to be given to him, which was granted him,
and so hee brought him to his house, and ha|ving
refresht him, told him he had a son which
he would commit to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Billius in vita Ioannia.</NOTE> which was this <HI>Iohn</HI>
who (as my Author testifies) <HI>Naturae praestanti&acirc;
atque animi studio &amp; industri&acirc;,</HI> by the excel|lency
of his naturall parts and endowments
quickly attained to a perfect knowledge in
Grammar, and Logicke, and Philosophy, Rhe|torick,
Musick, Astronomy and indeed in all the
Liberall Sciences, and, what is admirable, was
not for all his knowledge and learning tain|ted
with pride or vain glory, but still retained
his humility: His Master seeing such forward|nesse
in so young a Scholer, and such a prompti|tude
and promising abilities to future per|formances,
spoke these words to his Fa|ther;
<HI>En quod cupiebas plen&egrave; consecutus es; puer
enim me eruditione antecellit,</HI> that is, What you
have desired, you have fully obtained: for hee
which you call a youth excels mee in Learning.
Wherefore seeing I have satisfied your desire in
this respect, give me leave to end the rest of my
dayes in a solitary course of life, so that I may
be also skilfull in the study of heavenly matters,
whereunto all these <HI>Sciences</HI> and gifts are but
servants and subalternate; which words the Fa|ther
of this <HI>Damascen</HI> grieved at, being loth to
lose such an able man whom he so loved, yet be|cause
<PB N="428" REF="221">
he would not seeme so to requite his pains
for his sonnes tuition, gave him a large reward
at his farwell, and so dismissed him in peace; so
he going to <HI>Laura</HI> a solitary place, spent the re|mainder
of his life in heavenly meditations, and
in fulnesse of dayes dyed, and so did <HI>Damascens</HI>
Father likewise: his Father being dead, the
Prince of the <HI>Saracens</HI> called this <HI>Iohn</HI> to pos|sesse
his Fathers place, which hee at first refused,
but it was imposed upon him, which hee admi|nistred
with singular fidelity. Hee lost his right
hand, which was cut off by the policy of the
exhibition of certain fained Letters which were
shewed and read to the Emperour <HI>Leo Isauricus,</HI>
that if it pleased him to come with an Army in|to
those parts, hee would procure him the City
of <HI>Damascus</HI> to be yeelded to him; he having (as
he said) almost all the rule and preheminence in
those parts; <HI>Leo</HI> receving the letters, sent one
presently backe unto the Prince of the <HI>Saracens,</HI>
wherein he signified how farre it was from his
thoughts to make any hostile invasion into his
D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">minions, though hee had faire hopes of suc|cesse
by such a mans promise to assist and direct
him: Hereupon <HI>Damascen</HI> was presently sent
for by the Prince, and the Letters were shewed
to him, he wondred at the matter, and said the
hand-written was some thing like to his, but
for the fact or intention hee never harboured
such an one in his soule: but the Prince being
inraged, commanded his right hand to be cut
off, which was, as my author relates, restored to
<PB N="429" REF="221">
him againe, to convince by this wonderfull act,
the heart of the incensed Prince, and to manifest
to all men the innocencie of this <HI>Iohn:</HI> it
wrought so effectually, that hee had all his Offi|ces
and preferments bestowed on him againe,
but hee intended another course, for hee desired
the Prince to acquit him of all his places, and to
give him leave to live retiredly: after much de|bate
the Prince yeelded, and so immediatly this
<HI>Iohn</HI> did sell all his goods (except such as hee
gave to his Kindred) for the avoiding of suites
and strifes, and made distribution to the poore.
And so going to <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> hee went to be ad|mitted
into the same <HI>Monastery</HI> into which <HI>Cos|mas</HI>
had beene before; whither comming the
<HI>President</HI> of the place finding him to bee full
fraught with all sorts of learning, appointed a
famous member of that <HI>Societie</HI> to be his Instru|ctour
in the study of <HI>Gods Word,</HI> but hee, as also
a second and third refused it, holding themselves
not able to teach such a <HI>learned man,</HI> the fourth
takes him into charge, and gives him precepts
and rules both how to order his body and soule,
to whom this <HI>Iohn,</HI> perceiving his directions to
be sweet and wholsome, gave speciall obedience
and singular respect, though afterwards hee was
by his said Master ejected out of the <HI>Monastery,</HI>
for a matter of disobedience, but by his sorrow
and submission hee was restored, hee was full of
<HI>Divine Hymnes;</HI> and having by Gods blessing
gained much in the knowledge of <HI>Gods Word,</HI>
he was by the <HI>Governour</HI> of the <HI>Church of Hie|rusalem</HI>
<PB N="430" REF="222">
ordain'd a <HI>Priest,</HI> who having that
charge laid on him, hee did with great care and

<P>_HAving drawne the pictures of so ma|ny
famous Fathers, eminent in the
Church for their piety, sanctity,
and learning, it is necessary <HI>leviter
tant&ucirc;m vitam S.</HI> Nicephori <HI>adumbrare,</HI> light|ly
to shadow out the life of St. <HI>Nicephorus;</HI> for
indeed, what praises can reach the height of
his perfection? who like a bright lampe of
learning and of religious life, shined forth in
the Horizon of the <HI>Church</HI> in the yeare 840. for
then he lived in his brightest lustre, like the East
starre, leading both the vulgar by his Doctrine,
and the wise men by his writings to the know|ledge
of <HI>Christ:</HI> for <HI>sapientes faciunt &amp; loquun|tur
<PB N="435" REF="224">
sapienter omnia,</HI> wise men doe and speake
all things wisely: and <HI>Nicephorus</HI> being really
religious, must needs bee wise in words, wise
in actions, and, which is the highest wisedome,
wise to salvation. Neither was he inferiour to
most of the Fathers for profound judgement
and learning, both in Humanity, and Divinity,
having read much, and spent many houres to
adorne his soule with Art and Grace, that so he
might informe others in the Doctrine of Sal|vation,
and illuminate the world then being in
great darknes, and under the shadow of sin and
death. He was a <HI>Physitian</HI> to cure the miseries of
humane life, and especially those which are inci|dent
to the soule: namely, <HI>tenebras intellectus,
errores mentis, vitia appetitus, irrectitudinem
voluntatis,</HI> the errors of the understanding,
the viciousnesse of the appetite, and the croo|kednesse
of the will: for all these maladies of
the soule he cured by his powerfull Doctrine,
and religious exemplary life; so that those that
were blind through spiritual ignorance, he made
them see and abhorre their sinne: the lame in
Charity and good workes, hee made cheare|full
and forward to doe good; the stubborne
hee convinced and confuted by Arguments;
the weake he comforted and instructed. And
as the Sunne doth with his chearefull beames
soften waxe, refresh the drooping flowers, and
cherish the new sowne seeds, so with the beams
of his life and learning hee did warme and sof|ten
the obdurate hearts of men, refreshed
<PB N="436" REF="225">
wearied soules, groaning under the burthen
of their sinnes, and by his Doctrine cherished
the seeds of Grace, to bring forth in others the
fruits of good life and conversation.</P>

If the gifts and graces of his soule were so

sanctimonious and exemplary, hee being a spi|rituall
Physitian, and a Sunne to illuminate the
ignorant world; if all these may render his
life perfect and glorious, then <HI>Nicephorus</HI> may
be acknowledged amongst the most famous
Fathers of his time, who after this Pilgrimage

divisions of Princes, and Christians among
themselves, it is now the seat and residence of
the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> the arch enemy of the <HI>Chri|stians.</HI>
I doe not reade anything of his parents,
what sort or condition they were of, neither
is it declared by <HI>Historians,</HI> it seemes that this
<HI>Theophylact</HI> had liberall education, or else hee
would not have beene admitted to sueh digni|ty
in the Church of God, nor trusted with such
<PB N="451" REF="227">
a pastorall charge. I wil therfore principally fol|low
the passages that are worth observation of
him, as they are registred by Cardinall <HI>Baronius.</HI></P>
<P>Cardinall <HI>Bellarmine</HI> hath placed him in the
yeere of our Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bellar. de scrip. Eccles. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">33.</NOTE> 1071. when as <HI>Alexander</HI> the
second was Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> and when as <HI>Dio|genes</HI>
was Emperour of <HI>Rome.</HI> There have beene
great mistakes concerning the time in which
he lived, some having reckoned him 200 yeeres
before he was, which errour hee himselfe doth
openly confute in his Epistles which hee writ to
severall men, who lived at the same time. They
have placed him (though mistaken) to have
flourished in the Reigne of <HI>Basilius</HI> the elder
Emperour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Panvium vide in fastis. Sixtus Senensis in Biblioth.</NOTE> in the yeere 883, so <HI>Panvinus</HI> rec|kons.
<HI>Sixtus Sonensis</HI> puts him in the yeere 842,
when as <HI>Michael</HI> began to reigne with <HI>Theodora</HI>
his Mother, but his owne Epistles which are to
be seen in the <HI>Vatican Library,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Card. Baron. Annal. rom. 11 p. 402.</NOTE> being 59 in <HI>Greek</HI>
not as yet printed, but translated into <HI>Latine,</HI>
and preserved from perishing, by the care and
industry of <HI>Iacobus Syrmondus,</HI> doe evince that.
And first that <HI>Epistle</HI> to <HI>Mary</HI> the Empresse, takes
away all controversie in this point, for from the
time of <HI>Michael</HI> who reigned with his Mother
<HI>Theodora,</HI> unto the time of <HI>Isacius Comne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us,</HI>
nor any Empresse was called by this name <HI>Mary:</HI>
but to cleere this point a little more, for the dis|crepancie
of Times disi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ynts Histories, and
therefore it is profitable truly to know the series
of the times directly.</P>
<P>Therefore if you doe but look into his thir|teenth
<PB N="452" REF="228">
<HI>Epistle</HI> to <HI>Iohannes Duca,</HI> Kinsman to the
Emperour, which begins thus, <HI>Nunc demum ag|novi,
&amp;c.</HI> At length now I know, wherein hee
calls this <HI>Duca</HI> the principall man, and of the
Imperiall Line,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baron. Annal. Tom. 11. 403.</NOTE> now it is manifest that hee writ
this when as the Lineage of the <HI>Ducae's</HI> swayed
the Imperiall affaires of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> who is
of so little judgement, as to maintaine that he
lived under <HI>Basilius,</HI> and to these may be added,
that in the same <HI>Epistle, Bulgaria</HI> was not go|verned
by her owne Kings at that time, but by
such Governours as it pleased the <HI>Constantino|politan</HI>
Emperours to send to them; for in the
Reigne of <HI>Basilius</HI> (as <HI>Baronius</HI> speaks it) <HI>Con|stal</HI>
Bulgaros <HI>proprios habuisse Reges,</HI> that is, it is
apparent that the <HI>Bulgarians</HI> had then Kings of
their owne: and in his eight Epistle it doth
plainly appeare, that he was Archbishop of <HI>Bul|garia,</HI>
when either the Family of the <HI>Ducae's,</HI>
or the <HI>Comnens</HI> did sway the Scepter. But to let
this passe, it doth seeme, that this <HI>Theophylactus</HI>
had (being made Archbishop) a speciall regard
of the Churches prosperitie, a good signe of a
nobly qualified and religious soul, to have a care
to beautifie and reedifie the Houses of God: it
was the wicked speech of those in the <HI>Psalmes,
Let us take in possession the houses of God that he
in the land,</HI> nay, worse then so, <HI>Let us destroy the
houses of God that be in the Land:</HI> but that this
<HI>Theophylact</HI> did respect the <HI>Churches Mainte|nance,</HI>
appeares by his learned Epistle, which hee
wrote, and sent to the sonne of <HI>Sebastocrator,</HI>
<PB N="453" REF="228">
being the seventeenth, wherein hee laments the
ruine of some Temples which were famous,
but by the injury of time, and the violence of
warre, as also the neglect of men, were ruined
and decayed; and is not his letter wondrous per|swasory,
and full of Eloquence and Pietie,
which shews hee was not onely a great Scholer,
but also a zealous man for Gods Honour? I have
here set downe the words of the <HI>Epistle</HI> how it
begins, as they are also recorded by Cardinall
<HI>Baronius:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baron. Annal. Tom. 11. p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> <HI>Oro igitur, &amp; his litteris tanquam
corpore supplex procumbo, ut misercaris foelicis|simae
quondam Ecclesiae, quam Christianissimus

septem Catholicis, tu renova:</HI> that is, <HI>I therefore
doe beseech thee, and as upon my knees beg of thee
to reedifie and renew that one of the seven Catho|like
Churches, which that most Christian King of
the Bulgarians Borises did build.</HI> Oh! take pitie
of that once most happy <HI>Church,</HI> &amp;c. in which
truly hee doth declare also a great and Heroick
spirit; for hee that will sollicite Kings and Prin|ces
this way to shew their bounty, must not be
faint-hearted: oh, where shall one finde now
such a spirit? many doe strive to hinder the de|coring
or enlarging of <HI>Temples,</HI> few men plead
for them; but it shall be my prayer to God, to
stirre up some to stand in the cause of the <HI>Church,</HI>
and to blesse them for ever with happinesse for
their endevours, <HI>Sions carved stones, and seiled
worke will for ever speake their praise and worth.</HI>
But to proceed, It seemes the state of the <HI>Church</HI>
<PB N="454" REF="229">
was but deplorable, for he departed from thence
to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> age when hee
departed from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to <HI>Acridia,</HI> the
<HI>Metropolitan Church</HI> of all <HI>Bulgaria,</HI> he wrote an
<HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Empresse Mary,</HI> in which he shews
elegantly the despicable condition of the <HI>Chur|ches</HI>
in these parts, and prayes God for ever to
preserve the <HI>Empresse</HI> from all evill and dangers.
Hee underwent this charge a long time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baron. Anal. Tom. 11. p. 404</NOTE> though
(as <HI>Baronius</HI> saith) <HI>aegro animo veluti dur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters"> ex|ilium,
quo se tandem liberari vehemente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">,
atque patrio solo reddi:</HI> that is, With an unwil|lingnesse,
counting it in a manner no better than
an hard banishment, from which hee did wish to
be discharged, and to return to his native soyle
to which he was drawn, as it seems, not for any
unwillingnesse to undergoe the charge, but by
reason of the wickednesse and barbarousnesse of
the Natives, as appeares in his Letter sent to
<HI>Iohannes</HI> the great Courtier, in which he relates
his misery in that place most sweetly by the fable
of <HI>Omphales:</HI> it begins thus; <HI>Non servio Reginae
diviti, mundaeque &amp; pulchrae, sed servis barbaris,
impuris, &amp;c.</HI> that is, I serve not a rich, comely,
beautiful Queen, but I am inslaved to barbarous
and impure slaves, smelling of nasty skins, and
living a beggerly and base life, who are onely
rich in villany, and who admit of no civill go|vernment,
and hee calls those of <HI>Acridia,</HI> men
without heads, because, <HI>New Deum, nec homines
revereri norint,</HI> that is, They neither reverenced
God nor man. Yet for all this he in this deplo|red
<PB N="455" REF="229">
estate, proved himselfe, <HI>Vigilem operarium,
persever avitque in Pastorali cura diligenter:</HI> that
is, A watchfull workeman, and stood stoutly in
his Episcopall Charge.</P>
<P>I cannot but remember his Letter which hee
wrote to the Emperour; who desired that one
of the <HI>Dukes</HI> of the <HI>Scopians,</HI> whom he commen|ded
should be preferr'd to one of the Bishopricks
of <HI>Bulgaria,</HI> when this <HI>Theophylact</HI> with a great
deale of sanctity and wisdome returned this
answer to the Emperour. It begins, <HI>Quoniam
ergo de accepta Domini mei Scheda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Baron. Annal. Tom. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> p. 404.</NOTE> <HI>quae de Epis|copatu
agebat respondi, &amp;c.</HI> that is, I have
therefore not onely answered the Letter of my
Lord which treated of the Bishopricke, but
also I have written to him some things concer|ning
the condition of the Bishopricke it selfe. It
is not for my Lord to intrude into this sacred
Function, which containes great and fearfull
things, for they, who have by us as yet beene
preferr'd to <HI>Bishopricks,</HI> some of them when as
they ministred in this <HI>Church</HI> had good Testi|mony
of their pietie and gravitie, before they
obtain'd that weighty charge, as the <HI>Moro|bians,</HI>
and <HI>Prisdians,</HI> and some were before emi|nent
for reaching and eloquence at <HI>Constanti|nople,</HI>
as the <HI>Castorians</HI> and <HI>Belegards.</HI> And o|thers
were renowmed for their austerity and
sanctitie of life in Monasteries, and either well
known unto us, or else sufficiently by Letters re|commended,
as the <HI>Triactitzae:</HI> now if the man
whom my Lord speaks of be such as any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">f
<PB N="456" REF="230">
these we shal be bound not onely to admit him,
but also to give wonderfull thanks to your Ma|jesty,
for the care you have of Gods Church;
but if hee be neither knowne to us, nor yet ap|proved
of at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> for life and learn|ing,
doe not most mighty <HI>Emperour</HI> too rashly
offend God, nor lay unfitting burthens upon
us, for in this case it is better to obey God than
man. And beside, there is no <HI>Bishoprick</HI> at this
time void except that of <HI>Bydin,</HI> which is scarce
worth acceptance; and yet of all others it re|quires
a man that must bee well experienced in
Spirituall and Secular affaires. This very Letter
is testimony sufficient what a Reverend Prelate
this <HI>Theophylact</HI> was, in that he would have none
admitted, but such as were furnished with gifts
and graces suteable to that charge.</P>
<P>And when as by warre the Churches in <HI>Bul|garia</HI>
suffered much misery by the Armies of the
<HI>Servians,</HI> which came to bring <HI>Bulgaria</HI> into
subjection; doth not this Archbishop de|plore
and deeply lament the devastation in his
seventeenth Epistle to <HI>Sebastocrator:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baron. Annal. Tom. 11. p. 437</NOTE> <HI>ab omni|bus
praetergredientibus viamspoliatur, &amp;c.</HI> that
is, It is spoiled by every one that passeth by,
neither hath it any Bishop resident, for his back
shall be wounded with blows, and his cheeks
with buffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ings, so that the Bishop is fled, and
none will supply his office: but the people are
fled into Caves and Woods from the violence
of the sword, and no Priest nor Deaeon (<HI>&ocirc; mi|serias
meas</HI>) saith hee, (the more is my griefe)
<PB N="457" REF="230">
to officiate in that once renowmed <HI>Bulgarian</HI>
Church: so I went to see it, and when I beheld
it, I wept, and weeping ask'd the cause, and
learn'd it, and know it, and doe certifie this to
be truth.</P>
<P>Did he not likewise write a consolatory Let|ter
to <HI>Camaterus Gregorius</HI> Bishop of a Church,
which w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s buried by the fury of war, which be|gins,

Temple of God, and so wisheth (as <HI>Ieremie</HI>)
<HI>that his head were a fountaine of teares,</HI> and with|all

comforted, since it proceeded by Gods permissi|on,
and perhaps for the best, and saith to him,
<HI>Exurge igitur charissime frater, &amp;c.</HI> that is, stand
up therefore most dear brother, stand shew your
constancie and Christian valour, for you must
comfort others, make others valiant, and there|fore
not to droop your self, remember that once
renowmed Temple, and the wonder of the
World built by King <HI>Salomon;</HI> yet laid waste by
the <HI>Babylonians,</HI> and rebuilt, and did not the
Prophet <HI>Aggee</HI> then comfort the people mourn|ing,
and told them the glory of the latter house
should be greater than the first: and so it may
please God to deal with your <HI>Church:</HI> and did he
not likewise send consolations to the Bishop of
<PB N="458" REF="231">
<HI>Bydin,</HI> who was in the same misery, and did hee
not send a most divine <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Patriarch</HI>
of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> wherein he declares the fear|full
vastations of the Church? And did not the
<HI>Patriarch,</HI> write backe againe to comfort him,
and did he not highly prayse him? What a wor|thy
<HI>Epistle</HI> did hee write to <HI>Nicholaus Sebastus
Pagurianus,</HI> wherein he rejoyceth for his happy
victory over the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Franks:</HI> who de|sires

may reade it in <HI>Baronius</HI> at large, it being too te|dious

<P>So this Father having indured the miseries that
a barbarous Nation could offer, and having seen
most lamentable destruction of many <HI>Churches,</HI>

<P>_THat the Reader may reape the more
satisfaction, concerning this famous
Father of the Church, St. <HI>Anselmus,</HI>
who was Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbu|ry,</HI>
I thinke it very fit to speake something of
his Country and Parents. His fathers name was
<HI>Gundulphus,</HI> and his mothers name was <HI>Ermer|berga,</HI>
both of them well and nobly descended,
and both of them abounding with wealth, lived
in the holy state of wedlocke a long time, in the
City <HI>Augusta.</HI> Which City lying on the confines
of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and of the <HI>Longobards,</HI> was the
birth-place of this noble Matron: and she made
<HI>Gundulphus</HI> of a stranger a Citizen of the same
<PB N="463" REF="233">
place: she was the more devout, for her hus|band
followed his secular affaires, and hath bin
censured of some as too profuse and prodigall:
But <HI>Ermerberga,</HI> with great care and providence
lookt to the government of her family, and
kept all things in comely order, of an upright,
modest carriage, and sweete behaviour to all
her neighbours: Yet <HI>Gundulphus</HI> before his
death despised the world, and the affaires of
it; and so entred into a Monasticke course of
life.</P>
<P>This <HI>Anselme</HI> being put to learning, proved
excellent in it, at foureteene yeares of age; and
then his Mother dying, he lost the best Anchor
to his ship; and so having want of good coun|cell,
and mother-like instructions, he began to
faile of his former good intentions, and did
give himselfe a while to the vaine sports of this
world, and neglected his learning and former
studies; so soone doth youth, if not well gover|ned,
follow fast to its owne ruine: But God,
who had otherwise disposed of him, and inten|ding
to use his labours in the Church, did by the
good motions of his blessed Spirit, speedily
reduce him: for his father did prove wondrous
strict unto him; and the more humble this
<HI>Anselmus</HI> was to his demands, the more did
he seeme to be exasperated against him; so that
<HI>Anselmus</HI> did fully resolve to travaile, and not
to live under his father who was so severe a|gainst
him: and hee was so hard put to it, that
in his travaile fainting, and being without
<PB N="464" REF="234">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ny refection, hee was forced to eate snow to
quench his thirst.</P>
<P>So having spent some three yeares in <HI>Burgun|dy,</HI>
and <HI>France,</HI> he came into <HI>Normandy,</HI> where
he hearing of the holy man <HI>Lanfrancus,</HI> desired
to see him, and speak with him; and if he could
so farre prevaile, intended to put himselfe un|der
his government, and tuition. Well, hee
obtained his desire, and so was admitted for
one of his Scholars, and being now held hard
to his study night &amp; day, his body was brought
downe with Watchings and Fastings, so that
he did begin to repent this hard course of life,
and thereupon resolves to turne a Monke, in|tending
(as he said) to dedicate himselfe whol|ly
to the service of God: And so having well
pondred the case with himselfe, hee comes to
<HI>Lanfranck,</HI> and desires to know which of these
three courses were the best; for he intended to
follow his father-like directions, and his pre|scriptions
should be a law unto him, either to
enter into some Monastery, or to live an Her|mit,
or else to enjoy his fathers meanes, and
to distribute it to the poore, his Father now
being dead? <HI>Lanfrancus</HI> deferres to resolve
himselfe; but he advised him to goe to the Bi|shop
of <HI>Rhone,</HI> and to follow his grave Coun|cells,
who was called at that time <HI>Mauritius&punc;
Anselmus</HI> comes to the Bishop through the
great Woods rhat are hard by <HI>Becc:</HI> he having
here propounded his minde, the good old
Bishop commends unto him the Monasticke
<PB N="465" REF="234">
life, as most sit and profitable for him; where|upon
this <HI>Anselmus</HI> resolves to enter himselfe a
member of the Monastery of <HI>Becc,</HI> being now
seven and twenty yeares old, and one <HI>Herlvi|nus</HI>
being <HI>Abbot,</HI> an old honest man, and had
setled that Monastery with his owne revenues:
into this, <HI>Anselmus</HI> being entred, set himselfe
studiously to imitate the vertues of the chiefest
and holyest men; and was so strict in holinesse
of life, that in three yeares space hee was admi|red
and beloved of all. What shall I speake of
his Watchings? his Fastings? his Meditati|ons?
How wisely and prudently did he convert
one <HI>Osberne,</HI> a wild young man? how carefull
was he in the visitation of the sicke? How vi|gilant
to confirme men in that course of life?
What famous Treatises did he write? What
Questions and doubts did hee resolve? How
mainly did he contemne the World? How bit|terly
did he repent him of his sinnes? How con|stant
was he in prayer? So that living thus ho|lily,
not onely <HI>Normandy</HI> tooke notice of him,
but all <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Flanders;</HI> and his fame was
spread into <HI>England:</HI> so that many of all sorts
resorted to him for Counsel. Thus by his worth
and piety, that Monastery increased within, and
without, within with Piety, Learning, and
good Discipline; without with faire and large
possessions and meanes given to it.</P>
<P>And now this old <HI>Herlvine</HI> being not able to
undergoe the weight of that charge, committed
the administration of it to this <HI>Anselmus,</HI> who
<PB N="466" REF="235">
having this imposed upon him, how wisely and
fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hfully did he performe it? Did hee not
distribute, with discretion, meanes to such
as wanted, did hee not settle good Orders
in it?</P>
<P>And now at this time the old Abbot <HI>Herl|vine</HI>
yeelding to death, all the Brethren with
one consent resolved upon this <HI>Anselme:</HI> but he
with words and teares denyedit; but at last,
their eagernesse, and the Arch-bishop of <HI>Rhones</HI>
exhortation prevailed, and so he is made Abbot,
the inferiour matters and causes of the Mona|stery
being referred to the care and charge of
the Brethren: <HI>Ipse Dei contemplationi, monacho|rum
eruditioni, admonitioni, correctioni, jugi|ter
insistebat,</HI> that is, <HI>He was daily in Divine con|templations,
and instructing the Monkes, with
admonitions, corrections, and comforts, as occa|sion
served.</HI> How full of Hospitality was he to
strangers? How humble, how cheerfull, and
how liberall, not onely refreshing their bodies,
but comforting likewise their soules with spiri|tuall
directions? Did not all men, knowing
his excellencies, send in reliefe to the <HI>Brethren?</HI>
either by shipping out of <HI>England,</HI> or by Wills
of men dying, still was this Monastery supply|ed.
There did likewise belong faire revenues
to this Abby out of <HI>England,</HI> to bring in which
to the Cloyster, this <HI>Anselmus</HI> came over in the
first yeare that he was ordained Abbot; and not
onely for that reason, but also to see and speak
with <HI>Lanfrancus,</HI> who was from being an <HI>Abbot</HI>
<PB N="467" REF="235">
preferred to the <HI>Arch-bishopricke</HI> of <HI>Canter|bury.</HI></P>
<P>Whither, when <HI>Anselmus</HI> was come, with
what a confluence of all sorts of people was hee
entertained at <HI>Canterbury?</HI> so there was Dis|course
had betwixt <HI>Lanfranck</HI> and himself; and
this is said of them both to their commenda|tions,
<HI>Non erat ullus eo tempore qui aut</HI> Lanfran|co
<HI>authoritate vel multiplici rerum scienti&acirc;,
aut</HI> Anselmo <HI>praestaret in Sanctitate vel Dei sa|pienti&acirc;,</HI>
that is, <HI>There was none at that time
that did exceede</HI> Lanfranck <HI>in authority and va|riety
of knowledge; nor</HI> Anselme <HI>in holinesse, nor
heavenly wisedome.</HI></P>
<P>He proceeds now to effect that for which hee
came, and takes an account of all the meanes
which did belong to their Monastery: but it is
to be wondred at, with what expressions of joy
and love was he every where entertained, what
grave Counsells and directions hee gave to all
sorts of people, especially to the Clergy; there
was not a Lord or a Lady in <HI>England</HI> at that
time, but did strive to expresse their loves to
him, by presenting him with rich presents; nay,
<HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, though otherwise
sterne and rigid, yet how did hee expresse his
love to this great man. So having beene joy|fully
received of all sorts in <HI>England,</HI> he intends
his journey for his Monastery againe, having
gained large meanes for his fellowes.</P>
<P>But now the Conquerour dying, and leaving
his sonne <HI>William</HI> King of <HI>England, Lanfranck</HI>
<PB N="468" REF="236">
also the <HI>Arch-bishop</HI> being dead, this <HI>William</HI>
began fearfully to waste the Churches through|out
<HI>England;</HI> which <HI>Anselme</HI> having with
griefe heard of; did he not at the solicitation of
<HI>Hugh</HI> Earle of <HI>Chester,</HI> and other Nobles, come
againe into <HI>England?</HI> and comming to the
Court, did hee not modestly and divinely tell
the King what wrongs he had done? and how
such things would draw downe Gods, heavy
judgements upon him and his posterity: but
the King was for the present unflexible: so this
<HI>Anselme</HI> went to this <HI>Hugh</HI> Earle of <HI>Chester;</HI>
but the King falling sicke, all men cryed up
this <HI>Anselmes</HI> fame, and that hee was the onely
man to bee Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> By the
Kings authority, and the whole Kingdomes
love he was consecrated the first Sunday in <HI>Lent,</HI>
in the yeare of Grace, 1093.</P>
<P>But he found this place, at that time, to bee
full of troubles, and cares; yet he being sent for
to Court, did meekly beseech the King to cease
from afflicting the Churches: did not this man
performe his charge with patience, industry, and
with expressions of learning and fidelity: he was
not any wayes addicted to pride, not ensnared
with covetousnesse, neither was he tainted with
idlenesse. He committed the administration of
his houshold affaires to one <HI>Baldwine:</HI> Hee did
mainly lament the abuse that was offered to the
Church by prophane covetous men, who took
the meanes of them into their owne possession.</P>
<P>The King return'd from forraine parts, <HI>An|selmus</HI>
<PB N="499" REF="236">
humbly intreats of his Majesty, that hee
might have licence to go to <HI>Rome;</HI> but at this the
King was incensed, and told him there should
no Pope have any Authority over his subjects,
nor any power within his dominions; hereup|on,
there was a generall meeting of all the Bi|shops
and Lords at <HI>Rothingam</HI> to decide this:
Here most, to gaine the Kings favour, were di|rectly
against this Arch-bishop: onely the Bi|shop
of <HI>Rochester</HI> stood with him: But the King
was so vexed, that he told him, he would not
hold him as an Arch-bishop, unlesse forthwith
he would deny the Popes authority: and again
at <HI>Winchester</HI> desiring of the King the same
thing, the King told him that hee should never
have that liberty, nor any other, if he did per|sist
in that minde. So <HI>Baldwine</HI> was driven out
of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Anselmes</HI> servants misused, and
his lands alienated, and hee himselfe derided
and hated; yet in the depth of this storme hee
retained his piety, and said that of our Saviour,
<HI>By patience possesse your soules:</HI> at last he was for|ced
by secret meanes to flye, and so came to a
place called <HI>Whitsands,</HI> and so to Saint <HI>Bertine,</HI>
being glad that hee was out of <HI>England:</HI> but
then the King hearing, presently ceized upon
all his lands and goods, and so <HI>Anselme</HI> came to
<HI>Lions,</HI> and was kindly entertained by the Arch-bishop
of that place, and so being weake in
body, and unfit to travaile to <HI>Rome,</HI> hee sent his
cause thither, but stay'd in <HI>Lions</HI> till they retur|ned.
They comming backe, told him, all excuses
<PB N="470" REF="237">
laid aside, hee must himselfe goe in person to
<HI>Rome.</HI> So they came to <HI>Secusium,</HI> and presented
themselves to the Abbat of that place; there
were three of them, <HI>Anselmus,</HI> and <HI>Baldwine,</HI>
and <HI>Edinerus,</HI> which writ this his life. So after
much travaile and danger we came to <HI>Rome,</HI> and
it was bruted abroad of this Fathers approach,
and all men desired to see him: but it being ex|treame
hot in the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> this <HI>Anselme</HI> li|ved
in a Village, seated pleasantly, called <HI>Schla|via:</HI>
a great deale of time was spent in delibera|ting
for the <HI>Churches</HI> good: but it was thought
safest for <HI>Anselme</HI> not to returne into <HI>England</HI>
while <HI>William</HI> lived, neither did he: but his suc|cessor
<HI>Henry</HI> came into <HI>Normandy,</HI> hearing that
<HI>Anselme</HI> was there, and did reinvest him into all
his state and honours againe, and he came in|to
<HI>England,</HI> and was entertained with great
reverence of all the Lords of the Kingdome,
and the love of all the Common people. So
King <HI>Henry</HI> was very glad that hee had gained
the peace of <HI>Anselme;</HI> but hee was even spent
with age, labour, and watching; for age brings
to us experience in one hand, and death in the
other; and so did not live long after his return,
but with a great expression of holinesse and
comfort did commend his spirit to God.</P>
<P><HI>Time</HI> deales with man <HI>Arithmetically:</HI> First,
he <HI>addes</HI> to <HI>beauty, multiplies</HI> his graces, and
then he <HI>subtracts</HI> all these, and makes a long
lasting <HI>division</HI> between him and Nature: And
now he is dead, it is high time to cover this
<PB N="471" REF="237">
sweet and heavenly Father with his first mother
the Earth; who (being honourably attended
to the grave) with the Rose and the Violet is

<P>_HE that reades this mans life must ex|pect,
that nor my pen, nor any other
can compleatly in each particular
act, fully delineate it, but yet as Au|thours
have publikely blazoned his worth, it
hath beene my care to register it in our native

spirit, as a whetstone or patterne to imitate. To
begin therefore with his parents, He was borne
in <HI>Germany,</HI> as <HI>Trithemius</HI> and <HI>Cocleius</HI> doe te|stifie,
but they were not so able for wealth as
vertue, they had an especiall care that this their
sonne should be vertuously educated: our birth-places,
<PB N="476" REF="240">

not bound to answer for other mens faults, nei|ther
is it to be concluded, because our Fathers
have halted, that therefore wee should be lame,
Vertue deserves commendation as well in the
Cottage, as in the Court, and many times is not
accommodated with the affluence of worldly
endowments. The greatest Rivers flow from
Springs, and the Tree is not to be disliked, be|cause

<P>This <HI>Rupertus</HI> was in his youth brought up in
all offices of pietie and duty in the Monastery
of <HI>Leige,</HI> under the tuition of <HI>Heribrandus,</HI> an
upright and prudent man, of whom hee acqui|red
the principles of those Arts that were fitting
his age, and it seems, his Tutor did not neglect
his charge, but finding him to be an ingenuous
youth, mildly imposed some duties of Religion
upon him, which he performed as carefully and
reverently: an admirable patterne, the onely way
to have men prove absolute, is to have them
<PB N="477" REF="240">
well at first seasoned, seldome fals that fruit by
stormes which is cherished by a milde spring.
There are few that faile in age, whose youth
have been accustomed and inured to pious per|formances,
being by this good Instrument so
fitted, now hee proceeds to higher actions, hee
made godlinesse the very food of his soule, and
profited in the practice of it daily more and
more, so that following that, he gained know|ledge
and reputation as it is said,
<Q><L>I bone, qu&ograve; virtus tua te vocat, I pede fausto</L>
<L>Grandia laturus meritorum praemia&mdash;</L></Q>
That is,
<Q><L>Proceed, &ocirc; Goodman, with an happy pace</L>
<L>In tracks of vertue, take th' rewards with
grace.</L></Q></P>
<P>He was not carelesse of any kinde of Learn|ing
that might conduce to Religion, so was hee
admirable for divine poetry, as may appeare by
his expressions of the Holy Ghost in excellent
Verse, as also the life of Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> and
<HI>Odolia</HI> a Virgin, as also his <HI>Hymnes</HI> upon <HI>Seve|rus</HI>
the Confessor, so likewise hee alwayes
thought upon that of Saint <HI>Paul, give atten|dance
to reading.</HI> Did hee not also restore the
<HI>Greeke</HI> Tongue at this time almost decayed in
<HI>Italy?</HI> nay, did he not fairly recover them from
their <HI>Barbarismes</HI> that were then encroaching
upon the <HI>Latine?</HI> so that it appeares, this Ru|pertus

was not onely famous for Poetry and the
<HI>Greek</HI> tongue, but also for Oratory in the <HI>Latin</HI>
phrase; a rare thing living in those barbarous
times to restore Languages to their Genuine
beauty. And if I should but a little digresse, it
would not be an errour, a little to insist upon the
praise of Divine Poetry, if there were nothing
else but the diligent practice of so many Fathers
as have been renowmed for this, it was enough,
and I cannot let some of them passe without a
due respect and reverence, they having beene,
some of them so highly in Gods fav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ur, and re|gistred

Saint <HI>Ambrose, Hillary, Sedulius,
Synesius, Paulinus, Ausonius, Paulus Diaconus,
Rhabanus Maurus,</HI> with divers others; neither
can I let passe his care to keepe the vertue of a
good Oratour, for in this also hee deserves an
eminent commendation; for take a way or di|minish
the lustre of that, and what spurious and
barbarous proceedings will there not be admit|ted?

this way, that with their Oratory, they have
wonderfully wrought to the stopping of Here|sies,
and the advancing of truth, to the convin|cing
of errours, and the converting of soules
to Religion. But I leave this as knowne, and
proceed to his further increasing abilities. As he
increased in yeeres, so in gifts; when he came to
mans estate, hee settles upon Philosophy, and so
to Divinitie, then he fits himselfe by prayers and
other duties required in such a choice, and here
he found that sweetnesse, that it was not satis|factory
to him to spend the day in these, but the
night also, and that not without fasting, prayers,
and teares, hee was long gone in yeeres before
he was made Priest, in respect of the dissenti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ns
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and in regard that the
Armies of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, at that time wa|sted

sent from <HI>Rome,</HI> so that it was an hard case for a
Student to reade Divinitie, amongst Horse|troops,
and to addict a mans selfe to the Muses,
when <HI>Mars</HI> was Commander: yet even in these
times did this <HI>Rupertus</HI> follow his worthy in|tentions,
and did not abate, bur rather double
his diligence, even in these boysterous stormes,

much more propitious was God to this

man, as is easily to be seen in his writings;
Hee lived long till hee was very old, and in this
his old age he did with abundance of teares la|ment
and bewail the vanities of his life, still de|siring
God to pardon his sins, to omit his errors,
<PB N="483" REF="244">
&amp; to make him one of those of whom it is said,
<HI>Come yee blessed children of my Father, &amp;c.</HI> all
his desire was to be loosed from the Tabernacle
of corruption, so that it appeares he had hopes
of a better possession in that Citie, whose buil|der
and maker is God. So in fulnesse of dayes,
after many tedious labours and travels hee was
struck with a Fever, of which he died, with great
expressions of joy and comfort, that at the day
of accompts hee should rise to live with the just
and upright men made perfect.</P>

</FIGURE></HEAD>
<P>_IT is not fitting that this great Light
which God did set up should be hid
under a bushell, but that his pietie
and vertues should be celebrated to
all posteritie: Hee was borne in those parts of
<HI>Burgundie,</HI> in which his Father held much land
and large possessions. His parents were noble
and religious. His Fathers name was <HI>Tecelinus,</HI>
a great Souldier, and such a one as Saint <HI>Iohn</HI>
wish'd others to be, <HI>laid violent hands on none;</HI>
but kept himselfe within the bounds of civility
and sobriety, and so followed his Commanders
here, that hee did not neglect his chiefe Com|mander
in Heaven: his mothers name was <HI>Aleth,</HI>
<PB N="487" REF="246">
sprung from a Towne not farre from the moun|taine
called <HI>Barrus:</HI> shee following the rule of
the Apostle was subject to her own husband,
and ruled her family with wonderful care and re|ligion;
shee bare to her husband six sonnes, all de|voted
to God and religion, and one daughter
which was also addicted to pietie: all these shee
lovingly did give suck to from her own brests,
the third of these was this <HI>Bernard,</HI> whose Life
I will now set forth.</P>
<P>In his minority hee was very obedient and
dutifull to his parents, wonderfull apt to learn,
and quick to conceive, of an admirable memo|ry,
accute wit, ready apprehension, ingenious
of nature, flexible to discipline, of an excellent
feature, comely personage, sweete behaviour,
courteous, meeke: all these shewing what a
rich Harvest this Spring would produce, when
he was young he was troubled with a great pain
in his head, which a woman having long time
used that way was brought to him, who said she
would remove that pain by certain verses by way
of enchantment; but when shee came before
him, hee utterly rejected her and her devise, ra|ther
being willing to endure the hand of God,
then the hand of the Devill, and God in short
time after in great mercy did acquitt and free
him of this pain, and did comfort him and con|firme
him as he did <HI>Samuel</HI> in <HI>Shiloe;</HI> being put
forth to learning, he was not onely as forward as
the rest, but exceeded, and even in his youth did
learne to mortify his head-strong affections: he
<PB N="488" REF="247">
was as well by education as nature addicted to a
solitary life; hee was also full of charity, for if
hee had any money hee would privately give it
away to the poor: his master dyed in his youth,
and was honourably interred: this <HI>Bernard</HI> was
to be admired for his chastity, and for quelling
of lustfull thoughts, so that hee did often use
that speech of <HI>Iob, I have made a covenant with
mine eyes not to looke upon a maid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob, 32.</NOTE> which will
appeare if you consider those two eminent de|monstrations
of it; the one was thus by the in|stinct
and suggestion of the Devill, there was a
young beautifull maid laid in bed, which thing
when <HI>Bernard</HI> perceived, though then in height
of bloud, and she an object to incite him to vio|late
his chastity, yet hee never so much as tooke
any notice of her, but lamenting her impuden|cie,
lay on the other side remote from her; and
so kept himselfe continent to the astonishment
of that bold intruder. And the other passage is
this, It so fell out, that <HI>Bernard</HI> with some other
of his associates should lodge at a Matrons
house, but the woman being overcome with
tentation, viewing the comely countenance of
<HI>Bernard,</HI> and the beauty of his eyes, and grace|ful
deportments of his person, when night came,
did prepare a more sumptuous Chamber for
him, than for the rest, and shee burning in lust
towards him, in the middle of the night came to
his bed, which thing <HI>Bernard</HI> suspecting sudden|ly
cried out, as if there had beene Thieves in his
Chamber, so the people awaking, and the wo|man
<PB N="489" REF="247">
fearing to be taken, fled; well, they all goe
again to rest, but the woman not being daunted
with this, approached the second time, but he, as
before, cryed Thieves, so the houshold rose a|gain,
but found non, nay, shee was so impudent
that shee adventured the third time; but being
by his cry, either struck with shame or despaire,
left off her enterprize: Upon this thinking it
not safe to dwell with Serpents of this nature,
he intended to remove, and though the world
seem'd to flatter him with hopes of honours,
wealth, preferment, pleasures, and the like; yet
hee was desirous rather to take the yoke of his
Saviour on his shoulders, and thereupon enqui|red
what place would best fit such a practice, and
at that time there being an order of <HI>Cistercians</HI>
come up, and having as yet, by reason of their
poverty of life and austerity, there were but few
that followed this course of life, and as yet few
or none admitted; It so fell out that after long
debate with his associates, he resolves upon this,
to enter himselfe a member of that society, and
so in the yeer of our Lord 1113, and of his age
the two and twentieth, with thirty more he en|tred
into this Monastery; under the govern|ment
of <HI>Stephen</HI> then the <HI>Abbot,</HI> and from that
time it pleased God to shew him singular mercy
and favour, and he made good use of it, <HI>not tur|ning
the grace of God into wantonnesse,</HI> but did
set himselfe wholly to the worke of the Lord,
and often would say to himselfe, <HI>Bernarde, Ber|narde,
ad quodingressus es?</HI> that is, <HI>O Bernard,
<PB N="490" REF="248">
Bernard,</HI> to what purpose entred you in hither?
and when by the appointment of <HI>Stephen</HI> he was
made <HI>Abbat</HI> of <HI>Claravallis,</HI> his fellows have heard
him say often, yee that doe enter in here, <HI>leave
the fruits of the flesh, and bring in the fruits of
the spirit,</HI> for this is a schoole to exercise grace
in, not nature. This <HI>Claravallis</HI> was in the Ter|ritory
of <HI>Lingonia,</HI> and was once called <HI>Absyn|thialis,</HI>
for the abundance of Wormwood that
grew there: it was a Den of Robbers, and was
not farre from the River <HI>Elbe:</HI> but now this <HI>Ber|nard</HI>
and those that came with him made this
Den of Thieves the House of Prayer, where
these professors liv'd in great want and penury,
in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakednesse, in
Watchings, fastings, and prayers, spare in their
dyet, especially this <HI>Bernard,</HI> lying often on the
ground, and this did hee onely to mortifie the
deeds of flesh, <HI>Plenus autem erat</HI> (saith my Au|thour)
<HI>devotione, mansuetudine, charitate, hu|militate,</HI>
he was full of devotion, imitating the
Apostles rule, be instant in prayer, and pray con|tinually:
endued he was with the spirit of meek|nesse,
so that hee had learned to practise that of
our Saviour, <HI>Learne of mee for I am humble and
meeke,</HI> and as he knew meeknesse to be a fruit of
<HI>Gods holy Spirit,</HI> so he put it upon his soule; a|bound
he did likewise in <HI>charitie, knowing it to
be the bond of perfection,</HI> and the chiefest above
<HI>Faith,</HI> or <HI>Hope,</HI> and would fast himselfe to give
to others that were in want: he could never in|dure
to keep any wealth by him, but all that he
<PB N="491" REF="248">
could spare, <HI>charitie</HI> dispos'd of: God crowns
the intent where hee finds not the faculty: true
<HI>charitie</HI> proceeds not from a full purse, but from
a free bosome.</P>
<P>His humility was likewise admirable, for hee
said hee had learnt it of so good a Master, that
hee should not bee a good scholer, if hee
should forget it. Nay, hee was so devout in
prayer, that as it is said of him, <HI>Orabat stans
die noctuque, donec genua ejus infirmata&egrave; jejunio
corpus sustinere non potuere;</HI> He prayed standing
night and day, untill his knees were so weary
with fasting that they could not uphold his bo|dy;
for prayer is the chiefest thing which a man
can present God withall: he seldome did drinke
wine, and when he did he was very sparing, and
mixt it with water, because he said as <HI>Salomon,</HI> it
was <HI>a mocker,</HI> and <HI>that strong drinke was raging:</HI>
and being ordained Minister, this lustre of holi|nesse
of life and frugality, how did they pro|cure
him reverence, authoritie, obedience, how
happy were they that could be admitted for his
auditors? and the first thing hee tooke speciall
care of, was to have decent and reverend carri|age
used in <HI>Gods</HI> house, and had an excellent gift
and grace in preaching the Word to the people.</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> is reported of him, that being in the Priest|hood,
and having remained some yeeres in the
said Monastery, that it happened one <HI>Iosbertus</HI>
a noble man, who liv'd in the next Towne to
that Monastery, was taken speechlesse, and was
as it were void of reason; which thing being re|lated
<PB N="492" REF="249">
to Saint <HI>Bernard</HI> by his sonne, he said thus,
<HI>Notum est vobis, quod homo iste in pluribus gra|vavit
Ecclesias, oppressit pauperes, offendit Deum:</HI>
that is, it is knowne to you how in many things
this man hath burthened the <HI>Churches,</HI> oppressed
the poore, and offended God: Now if hee will
restore what hee hath taken from the <HI>Churches,</HI>
and leave off to oppresse and vexe the poore, and
pray heartily to God, and confesse his sin, and re|pent
him of it, hee will by Gods mercie be re|stored,
so all things were promised to be perfor|med:
and this Saint <HI>Bernard</HI> did servently pray
and cry unto God to restore him, that they
which thought it impossible might see it, and so
believe in <HI>all saving mercie:</HI> it fell out so, that
this <HI>Iosbert</HI> performing what was enjoyned
him, hee was restored; and <HI>Bernards</HI> brother
who did not give credit to his words, was
convinced, whose name was <HI>Gerrard,</HI> so was his
Uncle <HI>Gardricke:</HI> His fame spread farre and
wide, and abundance of people came to heare
his Sermons; so that Pope <HI>Innocentius</HI> got him
to <HI>Rome,</HI> and how was he there admired for his
abilities? did he not worke upon the Emperors
heart, and for his Holinesse; were not all <HI>Church</HI>
businesses moderated by his onely advise and
counsell? and how did hee repell the intention
of the King who intended to have made <HI>Thea|ters</HI>
of <HI>Churches?</HI> and did not he reconcile the
Religious men of <HI>Millain</HI> to him, and pacifie
all things that then were in combustion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> where
were not his counsels held as Oracles? and what

what Bishopricks were not offered him? The
<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Lingonium,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Cathalau|nia,</HI>
did seeke for him with teares and petitions
to be their Bishop.</P>
<P>How many Cities in <HI>Itali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> especially <HI>Millain,</HI>
did thirst after his doctrine, and desired his go|vernment?
Did not <HI>Rhemes</HI> doe the like by all

feares were there that hee would bee made a Bi|shop,
and so leave them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Yet how humbly did

the repairing and enlarging their seat? How
did he stop the fury of the <HI>Schismaticks,</HI> and re|strained
the persecution? Did not he being sent
for to <HI>Rome</HI> oppose the <HI>Schismaticks,</HI> that hee
stopt their mouthes? and so by his care and di|ligence
peace was restored to the <HI>Church?</HI> Did
hee not so gaine the love of Prince <HI>The obaldus,</HI>

<HEAD>PETER LOMBARD</HEAD>
</FIGURE></HEAD>
<P>_HEaven hath been pleased to send ma|ny
famous Divines into the world,
who, like Embassadours, comming
from our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, have expounded the Gospell of Salvati|on,
and defended it from the schismaticall in|terpretation
of Hereticks. As therefore <HI>Solo|mon</HI>
saith, <HI>memoria justi cum laudibus,</HI> the me|mory
of the just is pretious and praise-worthy:
it must needs follow, that the praises of these de|ceased
holy Fathers, will encourage others to
give God thanks for raising up such worthy in|struments
in his Church, and also in their lives
and conversations to follow their example.
<PB N="502" REF="254">
Amongst the other renouned Fathers, famous
for Learning, soundnesse of Doctrine, Piety,
and integrity of life, <HI>Peter Lombard</HI> deserves a
prime place: For as it is a Divine gift, above
the nature of man, to instruct men concerning
God and Religion, and to move and incline
their minde to piety and sanctimony of man|ners,
so it is necessary that Divines should bee
furnished with Ecclesiasticke Eloquence, and
sentences, to bring about this great work; which
famous men, even from the first infancy of the
Church have endeavoured and laboured to ef|fect:
And from hence proceeded so many Greek
and Latin Commentaries, Meditations, Ho|milies,
Precepts, and Ecclesiasticall instructions,
written by the holy Fathers, who that they
might by their laborious writings illuminate
the Church in mysteries of salvation, were all
brought up to scholasticke learning; that some
by Commentaries, some by Sermons, and some
by Sentences, might all helpe to edifie and
build up the Church of God.</P>
<P>And this Father, the most renowned <HI>Peter
Lombard,</HI> of <HI>Novaria,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Paris,</HI> was (as
<HI>Sixtus Senensis</HI> and others have written) by all
Schoole Divines, for a certaine singular excel|lence
of Veneration, called the Master of the
Sentences; upon whose compendium of Divi|nity,
and Volumes of innumerable disputati|ons,
the most learned Divines of the most fa|mous
Universities in the whole Christian
World have elaborately written.</P>
<P><PB N="503" REF="254">
He was contemporary with <HI>Gratian,</HI> and as
hee gathered Canons, and was the Master of
the Canons, so he collected out of the sentences
of <HI>Ambrose, Hillary, Augustine, Cassiodorus,</HI>
and <HI>Remigius,</HI> suppressing their names, most
learned sententious Commentaries on all <HI>Da|vids</HI>
Psalmes, and on all Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> Epistles, in|serting
some things of accompt of his owne.
The Commentaries on the <HI>Psalmes</HI> begin, <HI>Cum
omnes Prophetas Sancti spiritus revelatione con|stat
esse locutos.</HI> The Commentaries on Saint
<HI>Paul</HI> begin; <HI>Principia rerum sunt inquirenda.</HI>
So that this <HI>Peter Lombard,</HI> being endowed with
all naturall qualities, improved by education
and learning in the schools; and being also pain|full
and industrious to advance Religion, to in|crease
spirituall knowledge, and to furnish Stu|dents
in Divinity with most exquisite and melli|fluous
sentences, so sweet, so admirable, and pa|theticall,
hee I say, to this end collected the
Sayings and Sentences of the Fathers, which
may be thence gathered and cited to various and
divers purposes, either to confirme any Do|ctrine,
to amplifie matters, or to delight the au|dience;
Sentences being the Creame of wit, the
abstract and epitome of words, for instruction
necessary, easie to be retained in memory, as
briefe rules of Life and Religion. How ought
then posterity to be thankful to this famous Fa|ther
<HI>Peter Lombard,</HI> who out of so many lear|ned
Divines, painfully collected so many Sen|tences
out of their Gardens, gathering Divine
<PB N="504" REF="255">
flowers which are all bound together in his
Workes?</P>
<P>And therefore although <HI>Laus est or atio bona
alicujus enumerans,</HI> praise is but the repetition of
particular vertues and goodnesse; Yet the life
of this worthy Father would deserve a whole
volume of praises, fild with Encomiums and
sententious Eulogyes: but because they cannot
reach his desert both for Piety, Religion, and
Sanctity, it will bee his best commendation
to read some of his sweet Sayings, collected
out of his owne Workes.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="sayings">
<HEAD>Peter Lombard his Sayings.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Sinne.</HEAD>
<P>Every sinne that is not speedily by Repen|tance
discovered, becomes a new Sinne, and
the punishment of former sinne.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Will.</HEAD>
<P>There can no good dwell in us that cannot
will good;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comment in St. Paul Epist.</NOTE> nor can we perfect good that can|not
desire good.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Law.</HEAD>
<P>Death is not by the Law, but by the fault of
man; but sinne is the procurer and efficient
cause of Death, because it turneth that which is
<PB N="505" REF="255">
good into evill. For so Physicke is not the cause
of Death, though it discovers deadly poysons,
nor the Law discovering the poyson of sinne in
reprobate men.</P>
<P>There are in us evill concupiscences and de|sires,
which are the Devills weapons, whereby
when God for sakes us, he overthrowes us, and
gives our soules a deadly wound.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Predestination.</HEAD>
<P>God condemneth none before he sinneth; he
crowneth none before hee over-commeth; but
he hath a definitive prescience of every ones
will, whereby hee shall bee condemned or
crowned.</P>
<P>If God be for us by predestinating us before
our being, by our vocation when we were ene|mies,
by justifying us when we were sinners, by
glorifying us when we were mortall; nothing
can hurt us, but all things worke for our
good.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Gods Love.</HEAD>
<P>If nothing can separate us from Gods love,
what more certaine and greater good can there
be? For he that loveth God cannot dye; but it
is death not to love God, or to preferre any
thing before the love of God; therfore the love
of God is a right affection of the minde, which
joyneth us to God; and God sheweth his love
<PB N="506" REF="256">
to us in Christ, whom for us hee delivered
to death.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of gifts.</HEAD>
<P>Let none glory in the gifts of Preachers, or
men, in that they edifie more by them; for
they are not authors of grace, but ministers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Love.</HEAD>
<P>The reall vertue of Piety is the love of a pure
heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comment. in 3. cap. in Paul.</NOTE> a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.
This is vertue which nothing overcommeth;
no fire or windes of persecution; no flames of
temptations can extinguish: of this vertue it is
said, Love is as strong as death, by a contrary
comparison: For as death is violent in destroy|ing,
so love is violent in preserving.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Corporall Exercise.</HEAD>
<P>Corporall exercise, as Fasting, watching,
and abstinence, which bridle the flesh, are
little profitable, unlesse piety be added there|unto;
for it makes us shunne vices, and so to
be excusable for some vices, but not for all, but
piety and good workes are gratefull unto
God.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="507" REF="256">
<HEAD>Of Christs Love.</HEAD>
<P>There came one without sinne, that saved us
from sinne; for the Sonne of man came to seeke
and to save sinners, because he came in love as
he was man, and was from eternity as he was
God.</P>
<P>The instruction of words is not so powerfull
as the exhortation of workes: for if those that
teach the truth well doe neglect to do well, they
shall hardly profit their audience. For workes
perswade more than words.</P>

<P>_THis <HI>Irrefragable</HI> Piece of Learning
was borne in <HI>England,</HI> in a place
called <HI>Hales</HI> in <HI>Norfolke;</HI> where ha|ving
had liberall and free education
bestowed on him by his friends, he wholly ad|dicted
himselfe to literature: it seemes hee
had not onely an excellent wit, but as forward
a will to study; for he proved famous in a short
time, which argues, that he was wondrous pain|full
in his studies, and so gained the height of
learning by his indefatigable care, and labour:
And although <HI>England</HI> bred him, yet hee tra|vailed
into other Countries, and was as famous
abroad as hee was at home: for as it is testified
<PB N="509" REF="257">
of him; <HI>Magno tempore Parisiis legit,</HI> (id est)
He read a long time in <HI>Paris:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bartho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> de Pis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">is. li. 1.</NOTE> He it was, that
made the summe of Divinity, and divided it
into foure parts, which he performed so accu|rately,
profoundly, judiciously and learned|ly,
that hee was called in <HI>Paris, Fons vitae,</HI> the
Fountaine of life. So likewise others termed
him <HI>Doctor Doctorum, the Doctor of Doctors:</HI>
But the most generall Title of worth that was
given him was this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixt. Sen. li. 4. Bibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. Sanctae.</NOTE> that he was <HI>Doctor irrefra|gabilis.
Sixtus Senensis saith, that for his know|ledge
in all the liberall Arts, and for his wisedome
in Schoole-Divinity, he was not onely not infe|riour
to any, but indeed did farre excell all others,
so that he may wel be termed the guide of Schoole-Divinity.</HI>
Another entitles him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trithem. Catal. Scrip. Eccles.</NOTE> <HI>Virum in Di|vinis

Possevinus</HI> saith of him, that he writ the summe
of Divinity <HI>Ea Methodo quam ante&agrave; nemo un|quam

the <HI>pens</HI> that have writ in <HI>his praise, Petrus Ru|dolphus</HI>
hath gone the highest, whose <HI>Encomi|um</HI>
of it selfe is sufficient to cause this Author
to be esteemed: And since he was so famous a
Writer, I cannot let his name and fame dye
without adding something of mine own know|ledge
<PB N="510" REF="258">
to perpetu ate him to posterity. There be
three or foure remarkable things in him, which
praise him sufficiently; as first his general Lear|ning;
secondly, the Scholars of note that hee
was Tutor unto: thirdly, the <HI>various Workes</HI>
that he writ: fourthly, the honest and sanctified
life that he alwayes led: and lastly his death.</P>
<P>For the first, who can suspect his ability for
any kinde of Learning, when as hee is rather
admired of all, than yet equallized by any? Who
that is of solid judgement, but doe allow of his
authority? who but subscribes to his <HI>Conclusi|ons?</HI>
Who desires not to register his undeny|able
<HI>Sentences?</HI> Who but spend themselves at
the Lampe to have resolution of difficult points
from his <HI>Treasury?</HI> What Case doth hee leave
unresolved? what Science doth he not handle?
Is hee not absolute for Grammar? fluent for
Rhetorique? deepe in Philosophy&punc; expert in
Metaphysicks? made up compleat for Divini|ty?
Who almost can reckon up the number of
his scholasticke <HI>Questions,</HI> with their wise and
learned <HI>Answers?</HI> satisfies he not any man in a|ny
poynt or head of Divinity? Is not hee the
Garden that's variously decked with most sorts
of sweet <HI>Flowers,</HI> and wholsome <HI>Herbes?</HI> so
that while some have endeavoured to bee emi|nent
in this or that Science, and with great diffi|culty
have scarce attained their desired perfecti|on,
is not he made up of all? as though <HI>Natures
endowments</HI> and <HI>graces blessings</HI> attended him,
and did both strive to the utmost to enrich him.
<PB N="511" REF="258">
And then secondly, doe not those worthy In|struments
of learning, who proved such solid
Scholars afterwards, speak this <HI>Alensis</HI> praise?
especially those two more eminent Lights, to
wit, <HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> and <HI>Bonaventure;</HI> the one
being for his admirable parts stiled <HI>Doctor An|gelicus:</HI>
and the other for his rare knowledge
in Divinity, is called <HI>Doctor Seraphicus:</HI> of the
first it is said, <HI>Tolle Thomam &amp; dissipabo Eccle|siam:</HI>
take him away and the Church will bee
weakned; and take away both, and how will
the Schooles be darkned, and their glory eclip|sed?
and were not both these, by their own con|fessions,
instructed and tutored by this <HI>Alexan|der</HI>
of <HI>Hales?</HI> the Master sure was an able man,
who gave learning in such a measure to two
such Champions.</P>
<P>And thirdly, doe not his numerous unpa|ralleld
Workes sufficiently renowne him? Did
not all the chiefe Divines, and Masters of <HI>Paris,</HI>
to the number of sixty, approve and seale to the
allowance of his summe of Divinity? Did not
the same <HI>Alensis</HI> decore and illustrate the old
and new Testament with Marginall Notes,
which Worke was called <HI>Postills on the whole
Bible?</HI> Are there not in Manuscripts, in foure
<HI>Tomes,</HI> Expositions and Commentaries of his
upon Saint <HI>Marke,</HI> Saint <HI>Luke,</HI> and upon all the
Epistles of Saint <HI>Paul?</HI> Did not his pen set forth
the summe of vertues? Hath not hee writ like|wise
on the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> Commentaries on the
Booke of <HI>Iosuah,</HI> on the booke of <HI>Iudges,</HI> on
<PB N="512" REF="259">
the <HI>bookes of the Kings,</HI> as also on the <HI>Psalms?</HI>
hath not his labour set forth <HI>Annotations</HI> on
the lesser <HI>Prophets?</HI> Are not those his Com|mentaries
on <HI>Aristotles Metaphysicks</HI> knowne
by the name of <HI>Alexander ab Alexandria?</HI> Did
not he write learnedly likewise on the foure
bookes of the Master of the Sentences? hath
not he made many sermons to the people? and
did not he compile that worthy piece that is ter|med
<HI>Vitiorum Destructorium?</HI> which is indeed
the very undermi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er of the Kingdome of sinne
and darknesse: these workes are so able to de|fend
themselves, that I neede not spend time
to lend praise to them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, as his learning was great, his
pains wonderfull, his Scholars famous, his
Workes unreproveable, so his life and conver|sation
was as upright and honest. Certainly he,
who did take such labour to kill vice in others,
would not harbour it in his owne soule. Are
not those his remedies which hee hath prescri|bed
against the Capitall sinnes, demonstration
sufficient, that his aime was to kill them? are
not all his arguments against them, as so many
Engines unresistable? who is so ignorant of his
pious intention, that knowes not the reason
why he entred into that strict course of life, but
that he might be the more free from the snares
of the world? and that he might have the more
time and space to give himself to prayer, watch|ing,
fasting, meditation, and godly writing?
and what ingenuous spirit but knowes, <HI>that
<PB N="513" REF="259">
writing many books is wearinesse to the flesh?</HI> (as
<HI>Solomon</HI> speakes) and did not he write many,
and those solid ones, which must needs take
up most part of his time? adde moreover the
set houres of his publick exercises, which could
not be performed with that generall applause as
they were, had not hee in private spent much
time in molding them; so that these things con|sidered
seriously, who can finde almost in all
his life any time for to be idle, or ill imployed
in? did hee not all his life rather chuse to live
poorely, as holding that to bee the lesse sub|ject
to any incombrances: was hee not alwayes
a friend to the poore, as well knowing whose
Members they were, and to whom they did be|long?
And as his Life was full of Charity and
labour, so it was as spotlesse and innocent, free
from <HI>suites</HI> and needlesse <HI>contentions:</HI> so that
in all his <HI>deportments</HI> he shewed himselfe a pat|terne
of meeknesse, temperance, and sobriety:
And to conclude, when it pleased God to call
him from earth, was not his heart and soule
ready to be offered? Saint <HI>Pauls Cupio dissolvi</HI>
was his resolution; and at his death was he not
of all learned, pious, and devout men, generally
lamented, aswell knowing what a great labou|rer
was then called to rest? so after a religious,
devout, humble, and laborious life, he depar|ted
quietly in the Lord, being in his time the
glory of the Pulpit, the Father of scholars,
and the light and grace of the Schoole-men&punc; He
departed in the yeare of our Lord, 1245.

<P>_IN many Authours this Seraphick
writer was called <HI>Iohn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Petrus Galis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|us hanc vitam scripsit Lat. Gerso. part. 1. tit. de laudibus Bonaventurae.</NOTE> <HI>Gerso</HI> the
Cardinall of <HI>Paris</HI> thinkes that hee
was called <HI>Eustachius,</HI> some have
term'd him <HI>Eustathius,</HI> others <HI>Eutychius,</HI> but the
most call him <HI>Bonaventure:</HI> the reason why hee
was termed <HI>Eustathius,</HI> or <HI>Eustachius,</HI> was be|cause
in all his disputations had at <HI>Paris</HI> with
the <HI>Grecians,</HI> he stil was constant and resolved to
defend the truth with all solidity, and gravity.</P>
<P>Hee was borne in <HI>Etruria,</HI> of the <HI>Greeks</HI> cal|led
<HI>Tyrrhenia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 His Country and Parents.</NOTE> one of the most flourishing parts
of all <HI>Italy;</HI> called at this day <HI>Tuscany:</HI> his fathers
name was <HI>Ioannes Fidantius,</HI> his mother <HI>Rite|lia,</HI>
<PB N="518" REF="262">
both of great Descent, wondrous devout,
and full of charity: who had this sonne borne
to their mutuall joy in one of the ancientest and
renowmedst Cities of all <HI>Tuscany,</HI> called <HI>Balneo-Regium,</HI>
in English, The Kings Bath.</P>
<P>This <HI>Bonaventure</HI> in his youth shewed what
he would prove afterwards; for as he was main|ly
addicted to study, so he set himselfe to follow
that way and those men, which were most ho|ly
and learned in those times, principally <HI>Alex|ander</HI>
of <HI>Hales,</HI> the glory of that age, as also
<HI>Ioannes Rupellius,</HI> with many others, and for
certaine it is, that age was as active and full of
Disputations as any could be: so that <HI>Bona|venture</HI>
could not want occasion or opportuni|tie
for exercise.</P>
<P>For his feature and proportion of body,
though,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazianzen. Orat. 30.</NOTE> as <HI>Nazianzen</HI> said in the life of Saint <HI>Ba|sil;</HI>
his minde was so adorned, that hee would
passe over all the praise of his outward parts;
yet he doth plainly say, that Saint <HI>Basil</HI> when he
was young; was of an able, strong, constituti|on,
comely proportioned, gratefull in his be|haviour,
of an heavenly aspect. So I may say of
this great Doctor; though his soule was richly
decked with graces, his body did not want it's
persections: for he had a proper stature, a grave,
pleasing, and winning countenance; and he was
so healthy by nature, that seldome or never did
any disease or sicknesse torment him. But I passe
from all those outward decorements, and will
take a view of the gifts of his minde.</P>
<P><PB N="519" REF="262">
Being entred into a devout course of life,
who can but admire his innocence and integrity
of life? it was so eminent, that <HI>Alexander
Alensis</HI> would say, <HI>Non videri</HI> Adam <HI>in</HI> Bo|naventura
<HI>peccasse,</HI> that is, that <HI>Adam</HI> seem'd not
to have sinned in <HI>Bonaventure.</HI> And was not his
meeknesse and humility as great, which indeed
is the Basis and ground-worke, the Mother and
Mistris of all vertues, and that he might not for|get
the practice of it, did hee not ingrave in his
study that sweet saying of our LORD JESUS,
<HI>Learne of me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. c. 11.</NOTE> <HI>for I am humble and meek:</HI> Doth
he not in all his Writings lively expresse it; for
with what simplicitie is his stile composed off,
only for that hee writ for the good of simple
men, as he saith, and was not hee as carefull to
keepe his conscience unspotted and pure? Did
he not use ordinarily to say? He could not for|get
his appearance before the great and terrible
Judge? And they that please may reade the com|mendation
that <HI>Gerso,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Opusc. de pur. conscien. c ult.</NOTE> Chancellor of <HI>Paris,</HI> gives
him for the care he had of it.</P>
<P>Nay, such was his study of humility, that
lest at any time his mind should swell with pride
or ambition; he would put himselfe to servile
and inferiour offices, as to sweeping of roomes,
washing of vessels, and making of beds&punc; which
many thought too base to be performed by such
an holy and Religious man: yet nor any nor all
these seem'd so to him, hee knew how to bring
good out of them, for he would say, they kept
his body from pride and idlenesse.</P>
<P><PB N="520" REF="263">
Who when hee thinks of <HI>Bonaventures</HI> care
for the poor and sick, but will admire him; how
cheerfull was hee in ministring to them? how
diligent in visiting them, though their diseases
were noysome, and in some sort dangerous: it
may be said of him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naz. Orat. 30.</NOTE> as <HI>Gregory Nazianzen</HI> said
of Saint <HI>Basil, qui hominum lepr&acirc; laborantium,
vulnera &amp; curavit, &amp; osculatus est,</HI> that is, who
both healed the Lepers, and kissed their sores:
hee spent much time in these actions; yet per|form'd
the houres at his study: so that he seem'd
to be one who had a care <HI>to redeeme the time:</HI> if
he knew any troubled in minde, hee would not
leave him, till he had given him comfort: if
any was poore, what care would hee have to get
him provision? where any was falling from the
truth, how earnest would he be to recover him?</P>
<P>To come to his spirituall exercises of Medi|tation,
Contemplation and Prayer? Did hee
not make his head a fountaine of teares? Was
it not his chiefest care in all his Meditations
to inflame the hearts of his Readers; to kindle
the fire of devotion in their breasts? Hath hee
not shewed the vertue, matter, forme, end, and
distinction of Contemplation, and Meditation?
Hath hee not laid forth the parts, effects, fruits,
times of prayer? And in all his labours is that
saying true of him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trith. de scrip. Eccles.</NOTE> that his words were not <HI>in|flantia,</HI>
but <HI>inflammantia,</HI> that is, not high swel|ling,
puft up, but inflaming: such as moved com|punction,
stird up zeale, did work mortificati|on,
and produced repentance in the hearts of his
<PB N="521" REF="263">
auditors? What might not I say of his pa|tience
in bearing injuries? Of his true valour
in undergoing labours? Of his contentednesse
in refusing great Honours? Of his wisdome in
managing himselfe in all publike meetings? Of
his prudence in government.</P>
<P>But let us take a short view of excellent learn|ing,
and admired Scholership: who in this kind
flowed more than he? it is without all question,
that he attained not to such an height onely by
his labour, but also by the helpe of the blessed
Spirit of God. Yet his labour was great and
constant; he hated idlenesse. He read over the
whole body of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and made that fa|mous
piece which hee cals his <HI>Pharetra,</HI> by the
<HI>Works</HI> and <HI>Sayings</HI> collected out of Saint <HI>Gre|gory,</HI>
Saint <HI>Ambrose,</HI> Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI> Saint <HI>Hie|rome,
Cyprian, Chrysostome, Isidore, Anselme,
Bernard, Cassiodore,</HI> and divers others: hee was
so diligent in holy Writ, that he did write two
Bibles out with his owne hand; hee was so con|versant
in the sacred <HI>Scriptures,</HI> that he had most
of them by heart. One of his Bibles is at the
place of his birth kept as a treasure in the
Church, the other reserved in a famous Library,
as a testimony to future ages of his labour.</P>
<P>Now observe his happy progresse which hee
made in <HI>Paris,</HI> and indeed how could such a di|ligent
Bee as <HI>Bonaventure</HI> was, but gather honey
from such able Instruments as there then was; to
omit many others, these two were of note, <HI>Al|bertus
Magnus,</HI> and <HI>Alexander Halensis:</HI> so that
<PB N="522" REF="264">
by the Learning of these men, <HI>Paris</HI> was to
<HI>Thomas Aquinas,</HI> and <HI>Bonaventure,</HI> as once
<HI>Athens</HI> was to Saint <HI>Basil,</HI> and <HI>Nazianzen.</HI> After
the studie and paines of three yeeres in <HI>Paris,
Bonaventure</HI> was by the good liking of all
held fit to be publike Reader in Divinitie there;
which hee so divinely performed, that <HI>Gerso</HI>
sayes of him, thus: <HI>Nescio, si unquam talem
Doctorem ac</HI> Bonaventuram <HI>habuerit studium
Parisiense.</HI> I know not (saith he) whether ever the
Universitie of <HI>Paris</HI> had the like Doctour as
<HI>Bonaventure</HI> was.</P>
<P>The first Worke hee set out at <HI>Paris,</HI> was Ex|positions
and Comments on the bookes of the
Master of Sentences: Hee also made an <HI>Hexa|meron</HI>
on the first Chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> which all
men lament, that hee brought it not to perfecti|on:
but it was so well liked, that hee had the
Archbishopricke of <HI>York</HI> in <HI>England</HI> offered
him for his labour, which Dignity he modestly
refused:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annal. Franc. part. 2. 4.</NOTE> when as he was made and appointed
Chiefe of his Order, hee stopt the mouthes
of all <HI>Adversaries</HI> by his example, wisdome,
moderation, learning, and good constitutions:
hee was meeke and courteous to all, rather
working men to obedience by faire exhortati|ons
and entreaties, then by force and rigour.
His generall Learning is divided into three
parts, his exposition of Scriptures, his Tracts,
his interpretation of the Sentences. In all his
Works appeare Learning, study, exercise: <HI>Tri-themius</HI>
sayes of him to his eternall prayse, that
<PB N="523" REF="264">
he was matter, not words; subtile, not curious;
eloquent, not phantasticall.</P>
<P>His actions were as renowmed as his Works,
what journies did hee undertake to relieve the
poore, to profit the <HI>Churches,</HI> to reconcile dif|ferences:
this I cannot omit, that when as by
the death of <HI>Clement</HI> the fourth, at <HI>Viterbium</HI>
there was no Pope, but a great dissention a|mongst
the Cardinals for three yeeres together,
when as they had so ordered, that the choice of
the Pope should be put to <HI>Bonaventures</HI> choice,
hee contrary to all their expectation, chose a
stranger, a man of excellent parts, one <HI>Theobald,</HI>
Archdeacon of <HI>Leige:</HI> whereby he stopt a great
quarrell, and withall shewed his great wisdome
and integritie. And who knows not his admi|rable
comportment in the second Councell of
<HI>Lions,</HI> how forceably hee convinced all that op|posed
him? so that for his labour, hee was
made Cardinall and Bishop of the Church of
Saint <HI>Alban.</HI></P>
<P>So having spent himselfe in pious actions,
and continued studies, hee gave up his spirit
during that Councell, in the yeere of Grace
1274, and of his age the three and fiftieth, in
which yeere also <HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> his loving
friend departed.</P>
<P>There are many Miracles ascribed to him, but
I force no mans beliefe.</P>
<P>His Works are many, and counted rare pee|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es,
divided into eight <HI>Tomes:</HI> allowed by the
authorities of all learned men.</P>
<P><PB N="524" REF="265">
The first Tome containes Expositions on the
Scriptures, so the second.</P>
<P>The third Tome contains Sermons, and of the
Saints.</P>
<P>The fourth Tome containes Commentaries on
the Master of the Sentences, so the fifth.</P>
<P>The sixt Tome containes various Tracts of se|verall

<P>_THe thing principally for which the
memory of men is celebrated with
prayse and Commendation is wis|dome
that (in whomsoever found,
though meane of parentage and birth, or ob|scure
by Countrey or Nation) deserves perpe|tuity
of honour and reverence: for his wisdome
that erects our minds to the contemplation and
practise of divine things, it is wisdome that dif|ferences
men from men, and makes man like to
the Angels, 'tis wisdome that rectifies all that's
perverse and naught, either in the will or in the
affections. Wisdome is that which steers all our
actions to an happy conclusion.</P>
<P><PB N="526" REF="266">
This worthy Divine then cannot without
great injury bee left out from the <HI>Fathers</HI> of the
<HI>Church;</HI> his Name deserves an everlasting re|membrance;
for who had abler indowments
than this <HI>Aquinas?</HI> Who ever was more sedu|lous
for study, and more desirous of true wis|dome
than this great Doctor, which, as <HI>Bona|venture</HI>
got the title of <HI>Seraphicus Doctor,</HI> and
<HI>Alexander Alensis,</HI> of <HI>Doctor Irrefragabilis;</HI> So
this <HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> not undeservedly is called,
<HI>Doctor Angelicus,</HI> that is, the <HI>Angelicke Doctor?</HI>
For scarce any of the great <HI>Fathers</HI> of the pri|mitive
times shin'd more gloriously in the eyes
of the whole world, then this eminent man did
for sanctitie of life, and puritie of Learning.</P>
<P>He was an <HI>Italian</HI> borne, (as <HI>Cardinall Bellar|mine</HI>
hath it) not farre from <HI>Naples,</HI> of paren|tage
it seemes great and famous: in the story of
his life, it is said hee was borne in <HI>Campania</HI> or
<HI>Samnos,</HI> all hold hee was not borue farre from
these places; some others thinke hee had his
name of the Citie where he was born, being cal|led
<HI>Aquino,</HI> which in former times was great and
populous, though long since made a heap of dust
and rubbish by the barbarous invasions of other
<HI>Nations;</HI> but it not onely bred up our <HI>Aquinas;</HI>
also it was the birth place of <HI>Pescenius Niger</HI> the
Emperour of <HI>Iuvenall,</HI> and divers other learned
and famous men. However, if he cannot receive
any credit from the place of his birth, yet hee
adds Honour to it, and though it be now over|throwne
and laid waste, yet his name and re|nowme
<PB N="527" REF="266">
every day doth more increase and aug|ment:
and his <HI>Workes</HI> generally approved of all
<HI>Scholers,</HI> nay, indeed admired.</P>
<P>There is great doubt concerning his <HI>parents,</HI>
some who lived a long time with him, and were
daily conversant with him, report that he drew
his Lineage and Kindred from the <HI>Counts</HI> of
<HI>Apulia,</HI> and <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Sicily:</HI> and the <HI>Cassinian</HI>
Chronicles doe verifie and confirme this same
thing, which for every particular act and circum|stance
would be too tedious here to insert.</P>
<P>It is reported, that an holy devout man, who
lived in a place called <HI>Rocca,</HI> meeting <HI>Theodora</HI>
his Mother when shee was great with childe of
this <HI>Thomas,</HI> bade her be joyfull, for her wombe
carried one in it, and should safely deliver him
into the World, that would be heard of, and
speake through the whole World: and indeed
the issue proved true.</P>
<P>His youth was spent, for the most part, in a
learned Monastery of <HI>Cassine;</HI> it being custo|mary
and usuall for those times, to put into
the Cloysters great mens sonnes, to give them
generous and holy education: and it said of this
<HI>Thomas,</HI> that hee needed not so much tutoring
to make him a Monke, for he naturally inclined
to that course of life; He was humble of mind,
modest, bashfull, obedient, grave, industrious,
witty, all great furtherances to his intended re|solutions:
at his first entrance and admission,
(as my Author saith) <HI>Caut&egrave;, apt&egrave;, sanct&egrave;, verba
protulit:</HI> that is, he discoursed warily, congru|ously,
<PB N="528" REF="267">
holily: and that there was in him, <HI>ardens
orandi consuetudo,</HI> a zealous and inflamed de|sire
of praying to Almighty God.</P>
<P>It so came to passe, that his parts began to be
taken notice of by the Abbot of the place, who
diligently observing the young mans deport|ment,
did presently say of him, that there was
some great expectation of him in time to come.
Whereupon the said Abbot went to his parents,
and declared unto them how happy they were
in him, and related to them his excellent endow|ments,
aswell naturall, as those acquired by stu|dy,
and did earnestly beg of them that they
would not remove him from his course begun,
nor yet bring him up in Secular affaires, or to
follow the Wars; but to keep him at his study,
and he said, hee would warrant them that they
should finde him to bee in short time eminent
and famous: but however hee was by their ad|vice
and direction sent to <HI>Naples,</HI> to make tri|all
of him, which way, and what course hee
would follow: which City, though often mo|lested
by wars, yet it was at that time full of
great Scholers aswell for <HI>Greek</HI> as <HI>Logicke,</HI> and
indeed it was the seate of all the seven Liberall
<HI>Sciences.</HI></P>
<P>Not onely <HI>Italy</HI> at that time did abound with
Learning, but all <HI>Europe:</HI> amongst divers there
was one <HI>Dominicus,</HI> whose life and doctrine,
manners and institutions were highly praysed:
<HI>Thomas</HI> resolves to be one of his followers, but
by reason of the commotions and warres in
<PB N="529" REF="267">
those Countries, hee was disappointed for a
time: and this <HI>Dominicus,</HI> though dead in the
time of those troubles, yet hee left many excel|lent
men which professed his way; above all one
<HI>Ioannes</HI> which was so called from a Towne
where he was borne: this mans learning and pie|ty
did so sound in all mens mouthes, that a|mongst
divers others <HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> heard his
publike <HI>Lectures</HI> and <HI>Disputations,</HI> and that with
such great ardencie, that there wanted nothing
in him to be his Disciple, but acquaintance one|ly.
Well, this learned <HI>Ioannes</HI> tooke notice of
<HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> diligence in hearing, and see|ing
more than ordinary parts to be in him, at
last by the motion of Gods blessed Spirit, dis|coursing
with him, strove to make <HI>Thomas</HI> what
he formerly desired to be, and thereupon rela|ting
unto him the glory and felicity of true wis|dome,
and withall the vanity, instabiliy, vility,
contemptiblenesse of terrene objects, asked him
whether or no hee had any desire or bent to fol|low
the one or the other? to whom <HI>Thomas</HI>
readily and shortly replyed, think me not (good
Sir) to bee so backward or negligent to follow
vertue, lay you downe the method and rule, and
I will presently, (though through many dangers
and hazards) follow you.</P>
<P>Whereupon this <HI>Ioannes</HI> did goe to the
Master or Father of his order, which at that
time was called <HI>Thomas Lentinus,</HI> to whom he
said: Good Father make no delay, but give ad-admittance
to a young man, which is endued
<PB N="530" REF="268">
with all parts requisite for study, you need not
doubt him, take him upon my word, he will in
short time prove the mirrour of your house. To
whom <HI>Thomas Lentinus</HI> replyed, that hee was
much ingaged for bringing him such a rich
Jewell to bee of his Societie: so presently
all things being rightly ordered, as <HI>Thomas A|quinas</HI>
was admitted into his sacred way of life.</P>
<P>As soone as hee was entred hee slighted all
worldly desires, and ruminates with himselfe,
which was his best method to make a faire pro|gresse
in divinity, so he resolved to reade the
writings of the fathers in which hee was watch|full,
and to hear others wherein he had an excel|lent
retentive faculty, for hee did seldome for|get
any thing which hee saw was profitable and
excellent, but he aimed to get one grace above
all the rest, and that was humility, for hee was
suspicious of himselfe for feare as hee said that
the Devill should poyson all his good gifts, by
making him proud of them, a common infecti|on,
and by him well prevented, and secondly
he said 'twas not fit for yong men to rule, but to
obey the precepts and commands of Superiours,
and therefore hee strove to demeane himselfe
modestly to others Judgment, so that hee
thought nothing was to be spoke, done, or me|ditated
which had not beene by holy men in
former times practised.</P>
<P>To these hee joyned a third grace, and that
was <HI>Sobrietie,</HI> giving himselfe daily to fasting,
and in the night to watching, at all times to
<PB N="531" REF="268">
prayer for these (said he) are the conquerours of
all lusts and pleasures of the flesh; it is impossi|ble
for a man to please God, if his lusts be not
subdued and conquered. These were the pri|mordiall
exercises of this hopefull youth.</P>
<P>But in a short space, his name being up, so it
came to passe, that either some of his familiar
friends, or some other comming to <HI>Aquinum,</HI>
told his Mother where hee was, and what a wor|thy
Divine he would prove; she bearing a good
minde to Religion, and now remembring the
words had been told her by the Monke of <HI>Rocca</HI>
before, intended to goe to visit him, but they
who kept <HI>Thomas,</HI> fearing lest by the sight, the
teares and speech of his mother his mind should
be altered from his good intendments, secretly
convayed <HI>Thomas</HI> away from that place to
<HI>Rome;</HI> and from thence to <HI>Paris.</HI> Shee finding
their policy turned angry; and presently went
for <HI>Rome,</HI> but missing her sonne there likewise,
sends to her other sonnes which were souldiers
in <HI>Tuscany</HI> under <HI>Fredericke,</HI> that they should
beset all ways and passages, and if by any means
they could recover their brother <HI>Thomas,</HI> and
bring him to her; they desiring to please their
mother, &amp; being commanded by <HI>Frederick</HI> to do
so, at last find him sitting all weary by a fountain,
they presently apprehend him, and bring him a|long
with them: whom when his Mother saw,
she received him with teares; and withall saw
him put into that defenced Castle called <HI>Racca,</HI>
intending to tempt and trye what he intended;
<PB N="532" REF="269">
and there were no small complaints urged a|gainst
his brethren with the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishop,
shewing what an ill example of such violence to
a religious man might produce, and urging,
that if such insolencies went unpunished, there
would not want them, who would rob and in|jure
the consecrated Cloysters; and moreover,
that it was not fit his brethren should bee strict|ly
dealt withall for their fact.</P>
<P>But now his Mother having his person sure,
set upon him with a learned, deepe, grounded,
and eloquent Oration, mixt and parenthized
with teares, and all to draw him from that
course: and when she saw she could not prevaile,
shee set her two Daughters to perswade him,
which used all their power to alter his minde,
but they were unable to effect what they were
sent for; nay, they were rather perswaded to
follow a religious life themselves, when they
heard the divine exhortations that came from
their brother.</P>
<P>To bee briefe, his brethren Bore him great
spight, and as much as they could strive to lay
plots to shame him; insomuch, as they hired a
young C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">urtezan of a singular feature to go to
him, to see if she could entice him to her desired
lust; which she endeavoured to have done: but
this divine instrument of Chastity shunned her
allurements; and when shee saw her hopes lost
she departed, made relation to his brothers of
his constancy and integrity; and <HI>Thomas</HI> after|ward
gave himselfe to prayer, intrearing God
<PB N="533" REF="269">
to pardon his frailty of nature, and to give him
grace and power against such forcible tentati|ons,
that he might keepe his body and minde
holy, cleare, and undefiled, that so hee might
present them with comfort to his Lord at his
second comming.</P>
<P>He continued two yeares in this Castle impri|soned,
in which time he gave himselfo to divine
Contemplations and Prayer, and spent the rest
in reading and writing; for he read the whole
bookes of Sentences, and the word of God di|ligently:
But when his Mother saw, that shee,
nor her Daughters could divert him, fea|ring
lest shee might seeme to strive against
God, sent to some of his brethren that they
should fetch him away privily: which they did,
and carryed him to <HI>Naples,</HI> so to <HI>Rome;</HI> and for
the more safety to <HI>Paris:</HI> but he stayed not long
there, but went from thence to <HI>Collen,</HI> de|siring
to heare that renowned <HI>Albertus Magnus.</HI></P>
<P>He had two Masters, <HI>Iohn,</HI> aforenamed, and
this <HI>Albertus;</HI> which, because he saw a kinde of
unwillingnesse in <HI>Thomas</HI> for disputations, cal|led
him <HI>Bos mutus,</HI> the dumbe Oxe; but when
he had heard him twice or thrice in his publick
exercises, said of him, <HI>that his lowing would one
day be heard through the whole world.</HI></P>
<P>He taught the Sciences principally in foure
places, in <HI>Paris, Rome, Bononia,</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> and
that with abundance of wit, and plenty of rea|ding;
and when hee was publickly allowed by
<HI>Albertus,</HI> and <HI>Hugo Cardinalis,</HI> yet he never ex|ercised
<PB N="534" REF="270">
his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rts before he had fitted himselfe by
prayer, fasting, and watching: and that God did

Meditationes veratus,</HI> that is, <HI>he was alwaies ei|ther
at his Bookes, Disputations, or Meditations.</HI>
Insomuch, that supping at Court with <HI>Lewis</HI> the
<HI>French</HI> King, while other Lords were discour|sing
of pleasant matters, <HI>Thomas</HI> was so high
at his thoughts of disputation, that hee for|getting
himselfe strooke the Table with his
hand, and said, <HI>ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> contra Manichoeos conclu|sum
esse,</HI> that now the <HI>Manichees</HI> were foyled.</P>
<P>He was one that may be a perpetuall patterne
for refusing and contemning worldly honours
and wealth; for though he was young, and had
great wayes to helpe himselfe, yet he regarded
them not: nay, insomuch, that when <HI>Clement</HI>
the fourth, Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> would have made
him Arch-bishop of <HI>Naples,</HI> he did refuse it, and
when great promotions were offered to him, his
usuall answer was, <HI>Chrysostomi in Matthaeum
Commentarios mallem,</HI> that is, I had rather have
the Commentaries of Saint <HI>Chrysostome</HI> upon
S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">int <HI>Matthew.</HI></P>
<P>He desired three things principally: First,
that he might not be weary in well-doing: Se|condly,
that he might not dislike that calling,
though with poverty, which hee had chosen:
<PB N="535" REF="270">
thirdly, what became of his brother <HI>Rainal|dus,</HI>
who endured such a bloody death for the
good of the Church; and in this last he said, hee
was sure that his brother, for that temporall
death, enjoyed eternall life.</P>
<P>In his teaching hee alwayes strove to frame
his speech to the peoples capacity; and that hee
might avoid all pride and ostentation: nay, in
his disputations, he would seeme to yeeld, that
he might rather shew his humility, than height
of learning: Hee had abundance of Auditors, as
Doctors, Bishops, Arch-bishops, Cardinalls,
who counted themselves happy in being his hea|rers:
He was of spirit wondrous mild, in his cor|rections
and reproofes, hee would hate the vice
and spare the person. When as he was deputed
to be at the Councell of <HI>Lions,</HI> hee fell sicke and
was carryed on a Mule to <HI>Severinum;</HI> where,
when he was entred into a Cloyster, he writ his
Commentaries on the <HI>Canticles;</HI> and perceiving
his death to draw nigh, received the blessed <HI>Eu|charist</HI>
prostrate on the earth. After when his
sister asked him if he would have any thing? an|swered,
he should within a little space enjoy all
things: This was his fiftieth yeare of his age.</P>
<P>He had many witty sayings, as one asking
him, why he was so long silent under <HI>Albertus?</HI>
he answered, because he had nothing of worth
to say to him. Another asked him, what was the
most pleasant thing to him? Hee replyed, to
understand all he had read. One telling him, he
was not learned, as he was supposed; hee an|swered,
<PB N="536" REF="271">
I will study the more to prove his
words false. A woman reproved him, that see|ing
hee was borne of a woman, hee should so
shunne them: Yes (said he) even therefore be|cause
I was borne of them. One asked him how
he might live without blame? hee told him, if
he would remember his reckoning to the great
Judge of Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P>So when, after great paines and studies, hee
had approved himselfe to the Church of God,
he yeelded to Nature, and was honourably
interred with all the Rites and Ceremonies due
to so great a person as he was. His Workes are
of that value, that he who hath them in his stu|dy,
is furnished for all manner of learning.</P>

<HEAD>His Sayings.</HEAD>
<P>A day will come,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aquinas de Humanitate Christi Art. 25</NOTE> when faire dealing shall be
found a jewell, and false dealing shall come to
nothing; when a good conscience shall be bet|ter
than a good purse; for the Judge will not
then be put off with faire words, nor drawne
aside with hope of reward.</P>
<P>He that's armed for the warres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. de eruditi|one Principum lib. 7. cap. 3.</NOTE> let him con|sider
who it is that gives him strength, and tea|cheth
his fingers to fight; then let him employ
that strength to his glory; so that by this means
come life, come death, all's welcome that God
sends.</P>
<P>In all thy undertaking make much of time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. ut supra. cap. 6. lib. 5.</NOTE>
especially in that weighty matter of Salvation:
O how much would that man, which now lies
frying in Hell, rejoyce, if there were but possibi|lity
<PB N="537" REF="271">
to obtain the least moment of time where|in
he might compasse the favour of God, and
so be freed from those torments which seize up|on
him for evermore.</P>
<P>Thou that art young hast death at thy back,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id. cap. 8. lib. 5.</NOTE>
whereas the old man hath it before his eyes: and
that must needs b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> a more dangerous enemy
that pursues thee, than that which marcheth up

thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth, and re|member

promise, they shall have to morrow to repent.</P>

<P>THus farre have we brought the lives of these ho|ly
Fathers and Doctors, in every Century of
yeares wherein they lived, downe to our owne
Moderne Writers, whose vertues have shined on
Earth, like starres in the firmament, by illuminating
the darknesse of the blinde world, with the light of
the Coelestiall Doctrine. These holy men, I say, did
willingly and chearefully offer their lives and bodies
as a living sacrifice to God; not grudgingly or
piningly, but with alacrity of spirit: for though by
the hand of envy and tyranny they were judged to
death, yet they willingly dyed for his cause, and yeel|ded
their bodies as a debt due to Nature: for they
thought so long as the soule was in the body, it was
no better than in prison: for the body at the best is
is but a Coffin of the soule, as the grave is a Coffin for
the body. Therefore let us strive, by their examples,
to goe to heaven like them, through persecutions,
tribulations, and all worldly temptations: for wee
ought to desire with ardency, (as these holy Fathers
did) that joyfull day which all the Elect have, and
doe still long to enjoy: For when <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Time</HI>
shall both cease, and tender downe their S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">epters of
authority (as I doe now my self:) prostrate before
God Almighty, then shall I, and never till then, bee
truely and really happy.</P>
