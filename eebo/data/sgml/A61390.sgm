More <HI>Leisure</HI> by reason of my bodily <HI>Infirmities,</HI> and other <HI>Re|straints</HI> than I could have desired. 3.

<P>FOR the <HI>First,</HI> we must come to a<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect; 1. The Names for Old-age.</NOTE> right Notion of <HI>Old-age,</HI> partly by its <HI>Name.</HI> The <HI>Words</HI> which are used for it in the <HI>Oriental</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> Languages, do on|ly signifie Persons or Things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">at are <HI>du|rable,</HI> that have <HI>lasted long;</HI> And <HI>some</HI> of them are us'd promiscuously for such as are dignified by <HI>Office,</HI> as well as for such as have <HI>filled their Days.</HI> And none of them do direct us in the <HI>Computati|on,</HI> when it begins; but do comprehend as well those Persons that are <HI>decrepit,</HI> as those that are only <HI>decayed.</HI> For in <HI>Gen.</HI> 18. 11. <HI>Abraham</HI> was an <HI>Old Man;</HI> and in <HI>Gen.</HI> 24. 1. there he is called with the very <HI>same word,</HI> but an <HI>Old Man,</HI> tho he was then <HI>forty</HI> years older than before. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> commonly calling an Old Man, one <HI>full of days,</HI> or <HI>stricken in Years,</HI> tho sometimes they are distin|guished,
<PB N="3" REF="6" MS="y">
<HI>the aged with him that is full of days,</HI> Jerem. 6. 11. by which it should seem, that <HI>Old-age</HI> comes somewhat short of <HI>fulness of days</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Senectus non est aetas ultima. <HI>Hier.</HI> in <HI>Jer. 6.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

The <HI>Latine</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Antiquus</HI> qui ante nos fuit. <HI>Senex,</HI> qua|si seminex, semimortuus.</NOTE> words for <HI>Old-age,</HI> do signifie <HI>multitude of years,</HI> or <HI>Decay</HI> of strength: Or <HI>Precedence</HI> and <HI>Priority</HI> of Existence. But the most usual and proper <HI>word</HI> for it denotes a Person, who hath one Foot in the Grave, that is <HI>half dead</HI> already; tho <HI>some</HI> derive it from the Diminution of the <HI>Senses,</HI> as if no body were old, till they were decrepit and began to dote.</P>
<P>Our <HI>English</HI> word <HI>Old</HI> is of a <HI>German</HI> descent. The <HI>High-Dutch</HI> calling an Aged person, <HI>Alt-man.</HI> The <HI>Saxons, Eald</HI> or <HI>Olt-min;</HI> the <HI>Low-Dutch, Oud-man.</HI> All which <HI>some</HI> derive from the <HI>Latines,</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Alt.</HI> qua|si aetate al|tus.</NOTE> <HI>o|thers</HI> from the <HI>Hebrews</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Vel &agrave; <GAP DESC="foreign"> alah, as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ndere in altum&punc; <HI>Minshew&punc;</HI></NOTE>: but none of them affording us any light concerning the proper <HI>Nature,</HI> or distinct Time of Old-age; tho, in their native significati|on, it is likely they in some sort did ex|press the <HI>Thing</HI> in question.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">It is clear, that there are divers <HI>Peri|ods</HI> in the life of Man, which are like so many <HI>Stages</HI> in the <HI>Race</HI> which is set before us. Herein we have some light in the Holy <HI>Scriptures.</HI> In <HI>Levit.</HI> 27. 3, 4, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where <HI>One Interval</HI> of time is, from a <HI>Month</HI> to <HI>Five</HI> years of Age; a <HI>Second,</HI> from <HI>Five</HI> years of Age to <HI>Twenty;</HI> a <HI>Third</HI> from <HI>twenty</HI> to <HI>sixty;</HI> and the <HI>last</HI> from <HI>sixty</HI> to the <HI>end of Life.</HI> And mens <HI>Strength</HI> and Ability, at least in those <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Places,</HI> may be collected from their <HI>Valuation,</HI> which is there adjusted by <HI>God</HI> himself. Humane <HI>Authors</HI> have variously divided the Life of <HI>Man.</HI> Some into <HI>Four</HI> parts, answering the <HI>four</HI> parts of the <HI>Year; Spring, Summer, Autumn,</HI> and <HI>Winter. Others</HI> into <HI>Seven;</HI> assign|<HI>ing</HI> each part of it to a different <HI>Planet;</HI> and so <HI>Old-age</HI> to <HI>Saturn.</HI> But Man's <HI>Age</HI> seems most fitly to be distributed into, 1. His <HI>Growing.</HI> 2. His <HI>Ripe</HI> or con|sistent, and 3. His <HI>Decaying</HI> Age.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>First</HI> of these; we need not be so Critical, as to begin it at his Conception, or <HI>Quickning</HI> in the Womb, tho he doth then begin to live and to grow; sith the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> in the <HI>Scrip|ture</HI> above-said makes no reckoning of his Age, until he be a <HI>Month</HI> old.
<PB N="5" REF="7">
Leaving therefore that State of <HI>Non-age,</HI> we may distinguish his <HI>Growing</HI> Age in|to <HI>Infancy, Child-hood</HI> and <HI>Youth. Infan|cy</HI> ends when we begin to go and speak. <HI>Child-hood</HI> reacheth to the fourteenth or fifteenth year; and <HI>Youth</HI> lasts to Twenty five. Unto these years we usually in|crease in Strength or Stature. Not but that some particular Persons, or in some <HI>Countries</HI> do ripen sooner; and also that <HI>Females</HI> are reckon'd to attain to the <HI>Se|cond</HI> Stage of their <HI>Growing</HI> Age, <HI>two</HI> years sooner, and to the <HI>third</HI> Stage, <HI>four</HI> years sooner than the <HI>Males;</HI> yet still the foresaid Computation agrees with the nobler Sex, and comprehends the Generality of them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ripe</HI> Age of Man follows, when the <HI>Parts</HI> of his <HI>Body,</HI> and the <HI>Powers</HI> of his <HI>Soul</HI> are come<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> to some <HI>Consistence;</HI> and therefore it may be called his <HI>Best</HI> Estate, or as the <HI>Hebrew</HI> signifies in <HI>Psal.</HI> 39. 5. his <HI>setled Estate: Verily every man at his setled,</HI> or <HI>best Estate, is altogether Vanity.</HI> The former is the <HI>Spring,</HI> this is the <HI>Summer</HI> of a mans life; wherein they who are truly wise, will be ga|thering both Temporal and Spiritual Provision for the <HI>Winter</HI> of Old-age<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">If Youth knew what Age would crave, It would be sure to get and save.</NOTE>. Now this Rational <HI>Flower</HI> is in its prime.
<PB N="6" REF="8" MS="y">
<HI>As the Flower of the Field, so he flourish|eth,</HI> Psal. 103. 15. Many indeed are cropt and gathered in their Youth, and others are cut off in the midst of their days: <HI>for when the Wind passeth over</HI> this Flower, <HI>it is gone.</HI> And it is observable, that <HI>Enoch</HI> in the <HI>first</HI> World, and <HI>Elijah</HI> in the <HI>second,</HI> and our Dear Saviour in the <HI>last,</HI> were called away in the <HI>midst</HI> of their days; to warn us, that this is not our Country, but that even in the time of Youth and Strength, it behoves us to prepare for another World. But if the Lord do still by his Power and Pati|ence, <HI>hold our Soul in life,</HI> and that His <HI>visitation do preserve our Spirit,</HI> this brings us to <HI>Old-age;</HI> and this <HI>Ripe</HI> Age com|monly lasts as long as our <HI>Growing</HI> Age, and so we may assign unto it, <HI>Twenty five</HI> years more.</P>

For, 1. It is not <HI>meerly</HI> such a <HI>number</HI> of Years without some <HI>Decay</HI> of Nature, that can properly denominate <HI>Old-age;</HI> sith in former times before the <HI>Flood,</HI> when men usually lived <HI>eight</HI> or <HI>nine hundred</HI> years, he that was an <HI>hundred</HI> years old, was a very <HI>Young</HI> man; and still we find that many are stronger at <HI>sixty,</HI> than others are at <HI>fifty</HI> years of Age. Thus <HI>Athana|sius</HI> testifies of <HI>Antony</HI> the <HI>Monk</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> that he had all his Teeth, and his Eye|sight sound, when he was an hundred and five years old. Neither, <HI>2ly.</HI> Doth the <HI>Decay</HI> of <HI>Strength</HI> alone, determine a man Old; sith <HI>Diseases</HI> and other Ca|sualties may weaken and wither him, who in respect of his Age, hath not at|tain'd the <HI>Meridian</HI> of his Life. Thus our Blessed Saviour was guess'd to be near <HI>fifty</HI> years old, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 8. 57. when he was but little past <HI>Thirty,</HI> being a <HI>man of Sor|rows,</HI> and <HI>acquainted with Grief.</HI> But when our <HI>Strength</HI> is decayed<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Senecta lass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> non fractae aeta|tis nomen est. <HI>Sen.

For the <HI>Causes</HI> thereof.</P>
<P>First, the <HI>Original</HI> meritorious <HI>Cause</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 1. The Original cause of Old-age.</NOTE> is <HI>Mans Sin</HI> and <HI>Defection</HI> from God. The truth is, it may seem somewhat strange, that Man being created at the first in the <HI>Image</HI> of the Immortal God, placed but <HI>little lower than the Angels, crowned with glory and honour,</HI> and made Ruler over all other creatures, should have his life burdened with so many sorrows, and then so soon arrive at <HI>Old-age</HI> and <HI>Death.</HI> And some of the <HI>Heathens</HI> did foolishly charge <HI>Nature</HI> with Envy and Cruelty towards Man,
<PB N="19" REF="14">
in causing so noble a creature to tarry so short a time in the world, and to grow old as soon as he begins to grow ripe; And <HI>Others</HI> as wisely concluded, that Men were sent into this world on|ly for their Punishment, for crimes com|mitted in <HI>others Bodies</HI> before. And in|deed, if you set the <HI>Scriptures</HI> aside which resolve the Case, it is somewhat unaccountable to have so short an <HI>Hi|story</HI> of so noble a creature. If a cu|rious <HI>Architect</HI> should frame and rear up a firm and stately pile of <HI>Building,</HI> and being compleatly furnished, the same should presently shrink, and in a short time decay and fall to the ground; Passengers would be apt to call in que|stion the <HI>sidelity</HI> or <HI>skill</HI> of him that made it; or exceedingly wonder by what means it came to ruine, till they come to know, that the <HI>Inhabitant</HI> himself undermin'd, pluck'd down, or fir'd his own house: So in the <HI>Case</HI> be|fore us, it is matter of grief and asto|nishment to see the most exquisite piece of Gods workmanship upon earth, to become decrepit in so short a space, and to be reduc'd so soon into <HI>dust and ashes.</HI></P>
<P>We must know therefore, that Man
<PB N="20" REF="15">
at his <HI>first Creation</HI> being made up of a Body and a Soul, was neither in his own nature so unchangeable and immor|tal as the <HI>Angels,</HI> nor so frail and weak as other <HI>creatures</HI> below.

<P>THE <HI>Third</HI> sort of <HI>Causes,</HI> which<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 3. The Preterna|tural Cau|ses of Old|age.</NOTE> may be termed <HI>Preternatural</HI> and <HI>Adventitious,</HI> that do accelerate or hasten <HI>Old-age,</HI> some of them are such as these.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Unwholsome Air.</HI> For the <HI>Air,</HI> be|ing the constant Food of the <HI>Vital</HI> parts, must needs contribute much to the Re|pair or Decay of the <HI>Body;</HI> and the more impure it is, must consequently impair and weaken it. Hence and from the Corruption of <HI>Food</HI> it is not impro|bable,
<PB N="25" REF="17">
that the Age of Man, after the <HI>Deluge</HI> became so much diminished; insomuch as <HI>Arphaxad,</HI> who was the <HI>first-born</HI> in the <HI>New World,</HI> lived scarce half so long as those before the <HI>Flood;</HI> as ap|pears by comparing, <HI>Gen.</HI> 5. 27. with <HI>Gen.</HI> 11. 13. the Air being now become more impure and unwholsome, than it was before. However it is most evident, that people do commonly at this day grow weak, crazy and impotent, who live in those places, which mourn under a malignant <HI>Air;</HI> and others are fresh and lusty at the same years, that injoy the blessing of a purer breathing.</P>
<P N="2">2. Secondly, <HI>Diseases</HI> are another <HI>Cause</HI> that brings on <HI>Old-age.</HI> For these must needs weaken that strength of Nature, whereby our life is supported, <HI>Psal.</HI> 39. 11. <HI>When thou with rebukes dost correct man for Iniquity, thou makest his Beauty to con|sume away like a Moth:</HI> and not only his <HI>Beauty,</HI> but his <HI>Strength</HI> and Spirits, for the <HI>Hebrew</HI> runs there,&mdash;<HI>Thou makest that which is desirable in him to melt away.</HI> And thus it was with holy <HI>Iob. Thou hast fil|led me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me,</HI> Job. 16. 8. His grievous <HI>Di|stempers</HI> had made him old before his time. Thus we daily see divers persons,
<PB N="26" REF="18">
who, in respect of the <HI>number</HI> of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> years, have not pass'd the <HI>Meridian</HI> of their Age, yet by reason of their <HI>Sicknesses,</HI> and especially the Dregs which some kinds of them do leave behind them, are old in their very Youth. These are like <HI>Storms</HI> without, which battering the best built House, will the sooner bring it unto ruin. Holy <HI>David</HI> said of himself, <HI>Psal.</HI> 119. 83. <HI>I am become like a B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">tle in the Smoak,</HI> that is, my natural moisture is dryed, burnt up, and withered. And <HI>Hezekiah</HI> by reason of <HI>sickness</HI> complains, <HI>Mine Age is departed,</HI> and <HI>is removed from me as a Shepherds Tent,</HI> Isa. 38. 12. Thus the <HI>Lord</HI> doth sometimes <HI>weaken a mans strength in the way, and shortneth his days,</HI> Psal. 102. 23. implying, that a mans life is like a <HI>Iourney</HI> through this into a another World; now by <HI>Diseases</HI> he <HI>weakens us in the way,</HI> as we are travel|ling through the World, causes us to commence <HI>Old per saltum,</HI> and shortens our days: so that by this means, some have but a <HI>winters day</HI> of life, while others injoy a <HI>longer.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Thirdly, Another <HI>Cause</HI> which ha|stens Old age, is, <HI>immoderate Care or La|bour.</HI> Each of these, when they exceed a due proportion, do exhaust the Spirits,
<PB N="27" REF="18" MS="y">
and produce early wrinkles; whenas, being moderately used, they do us no hurt, but good. It is indeed a part of the <HI>Curse</HI> pronounced at the <HI>Fall,</HI> on <HI>Adam</HI> and all his posterity, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. 19. <HI>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground;</HI> and the carking Heart and sweating Face, hastens man to the Ground. One of these alone, immoderate <HI>Care,</HI> or im|moderate <HI>Labour</HI> will do the work; but when the mind within is eaten up by continual thoughtfulness, and the Body without is harrast with extreme La|bours, no wonder that Weakness, Lan|guishment, and Old-age hasten on a pace: <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>He|siod.</HI> Op. &amp; Di. l. x.</NOTE> then doth our strength give place to <HI>labour</HI> and <HI>sorrow, for it is soon cut off, and we fly away,</HI> Psal 90. 10. Great indeed is mens folly thus to ruin themselves; sith it is certain that neither our immo|derate <HI>cares,</HI> nor our immoderate <HI>labour,</HI> do us any good at all: less <HI>Care</HI> and more <HI>Prayer</HI> would avail us much more; yea, and they do us much hurt, they disquiet the Mind, they disturb the Body, they provoke <HI>God</HI> to leave us to our selves; and then we shall soon find, that it is <HI>vain to rise early,</HI> to <HI>sit up late,</HI> and <HI>to eat the Bread of Sorrow:</HI> whereas the <HI>blessing</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="19" MS="y">
<HI>of the Lord,</HI> it <HI>maketh rich, and he addeth no Sorrow with it,</HI> Prov. 10. 22. Assure your selves, if moderate care and labour will not bring in Riches, then they are not good for you; and whatsoever is gained otherwise, hath a Curse in it, and will bring misery on the Body, or on the Soul, here or hereafter.</P>
<P N="4">4. A <HI>Fourth Cause</HI> which hastens <HI>Old|age,</HI> is <HI>Intemperance,</HI> that is, excess in <HI>Eating,</HI> or in <HI>Drinking,</HI> or in <HI>lustful Em|braces.</HI> Any of these, especially the <HI>last,</HI> do bring Old-age into youthful years. Sad it is, that our Life being in its ut|most extent so short, and our Bodies by nature so frail; we, that have a desire to live, and who for that end will be content to use the most irksome remedies, should yet so commonly invite distempers by our <HI>Luxury,</HI> and so shamefully dig our Graves with our Teeth, and deprive our selves of the residue of our years. In so much, that altho in St. <HI>Hieroms</HI> time he affirmed, that there were reck|oned <HI>five thousand Martyrs</HI> for every day in the Year, save one, yet we may sadly conclude, that <HI>Bacchus</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> have had daily more <HI>Martyrs,</HI> if we may so call them, in one place or other of the World, than <HI>Iesus Christ.</HI> In this sense doth <HI>Se|neca</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="19" MS="y">
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">De Bre|vit. vit. <HI>cap. 1.</HI></NOTE> truly say, <HI>Non accepimus brevem vi|tam, sed fecimus.</HI> From whence come for the most part those pains of the Gout, Stone, Dropsy, Convulsions and Apo|plexies, with such other Distempers, but from Intemperance in some of the fore|said Objects? A moderate use of Meat, Drink, and conjugal rights, as it doth tend much to the alacrity of the mind, so doth it no less to the Health of the Bo|dy: but <HI>excess</HI> in any of them, doth either <HI>suffocate</HI> Nature, or else <HI>impoverish</HI> and exhaust it; as it is observed of the more lecherous Creatures, that they are short-liv'd in comparison of others.</P>
<P>If therefore you would arrive at a <HI>good Old-age,</HI> good in respect of the com|fort of the Mind, or in respect of the welfare of the Body, oppose and check your unruly Appetites <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Pont gu|lae metas, ut sit tibi longior aetas. Esse cupis sanus? sit tibi parc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> manus.</NOTE>; resolve with the Grace of <HI>God, Hitherto thou shalt come and no further:</HI> conclude, I am a Man, yea, a Christian, and not a Brute; and conse|quently, am not to be guided by Sense, but by Reason and Religion, which teach me to use all these outward comforts, so far as they will promote the Glory of my Maker, and the present and future good of my Body and Soul.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Fifthly, Inordinate Passions</HI> of the
<PB N="30" REF="20" MS="y">
<HI>mind</HI> are another means to bring on <HI>Old|age;</HI> such as <HI>Anger,</HI> especially <HI>Sorrow.</HI> For these do manifestly prey upon the Spirits, and also produce such bodily Di|stempers, as do hurry people into <HI>Old-age</HI> before their time. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Nihil est quod sene|ctuti ma|gis noceat ac dies ho|minis abbre|viet, quam tristitia, languor a|nimi, &amp; ira. Nihil enim bilari sene|ctute jucun|dius. <HI>Cass.</HI></NOTE> Hence it was, that <HI>Valentinian</HI> the <HI>Emperor,</HI> by an excessive straining of his Voice, in an angry reply against some Offenders, fell into a griev|ous <HI>Fever,</HI> which at length brought him to his End. And for <HI>Sorrow,</HI> the <HI>wisest</HI> of men tells us, <HI>Prov.</HI> 15. 13. <HI>A merry Heart maketh a chearful Countenance; but by Sorrow of the Heart, the Spirit is broken</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Tis mirth that nursethlise and blood, Far more than wine, or rest, or food.</NOTE> And when the Spirit is broken, the Body must sensibly wast and decay. For these <HI>Passions</HI> like a <HI>Torrent</HI> or <HI>Land flood</HI> break down, and overthrow all before them: you know a <HI>River,</HI> while it proceeds with its usual stream, passes harmlesly, yea, profitably through all the Fields and Meadows, and makes no breaches on the Banks on either side; but when a sud|dain and excessive <HI>Rain</HI> swells it up, then it lays about it without mercy, and tears up the Ground, the Fences and Trees on every side: And even so our <HI>Passions</HI> be|ing moderate, are innocent and useful; but he that hath <HI>no rule over his own Spi|rit,</HI> is like a Flood of Water broke loose,
<PB N="31" REF="20" MS="y">
or like a <HI>City that is broken down, and with|out Walls.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, there have been <HI>Instances</HI> of such, as by sudden <HI>Grief</HI> have grown Gray in a few days time; and there be <HI>hundreds</HI> that carry the Badge of their great Sor|rows on their <HI>Heads,</HI> long before a due course of years would have brought them.</P>
<P>Let us not therefore suffer these <HI>Vul|tures</HI> to feed upon our Hearts, nor yield our selves Slaves to these unruly <HI>Passions;</HI> which war not only against the Soul, but even against the Body, and will ruin both, except they be restrained and mor|tified by the <HI>Grace of God.</HI> Philosophy hath gone far in this work, <HI>God</HI> forbid but that <HI>Christianity</HI> should go much fur|ther.</P>
<P>There are also other both <HI>Moral</HI> and <HI>Na|tural Causes</HI> of <HI>Old-age,</HI> but these may suf|fice. The curious may satisfie themselves elsewhere <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">See <HI>Ro. Bacons</HI> cure of old age, with Dr. <HI>Browns</HI> Notes.</NOTE> And by these <HI>Causes,</HI> you may easily discern what are the best <HI>Preservatives</HI> against <HI>Old-age.</HI> For tho no Art or Care can prevent the unavoid|able access thereof, yet effectual <HI>Means</HI> may be used to deferr it. 'Tis true, <HI>Galen</HI> tells <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Lib. de marcore. <HI>c. 2</HI></NOTE> us of a <HI>Philosopher,</HI> who affirm'd, that there was a way to prevent it, and wrote a Book of it, when he was <HI>forty</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="21">
<HI>years</HI> old; but the said Author takes no|tice, that when he was arriv'd to <HI>eigh|ty,</HI> he was wasted to skin and bones, and could not any way cure himself. But the most effectual <HI>Preservatives,</HI> are, 1. <HI>Piety,</HI> and 2. <HI>Sobriety.</HI></P>

<P>FIrst, <HI>serious Piety.</HI> By which I<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect; 4. The Preserva|tives of Old-age.</NOTE> mean, a Course of life in the Faith, and Fear of God, and in holy Obe|dience unto him. This is that <HI>Godliness, which hath the promises of the life that now is,</HI> as well as <HI>of that which is to come,</HI> 1 Tim. 4. 8. This is the best <HI>Antidote</HI> against that <HI>Poyson</HI> which hath original|ly infected our Nature, and which makes it swarm with Distempers, that hurry us to <HI>Old-age,</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> at last. This is, certainly, the best <HI>Means</HI> whereby to avoid that fatal <HI>Curse</HI> so early pronounc'd, or else to turn it into a <HI>Blessing.</HI> If <HI>thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my Satutes and Commandments, then I will lengthen thy days,</HI> 1 King. 3. 14. <HI>What man is he that desi|reth Life; and loveth many days, that he may see good? Depart from evil, and do good,</HI> &amp;c. Psal. 34. 12, 14. It is the ob|servation
<PB N="33" REF="21" MS="y">
of <HI>Hierom</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Hier. Psal. 91.</HI> in unde vide tur nomen hoc sanctis non longae aetatis rati|one sed au|thoritatis ascribi.</NOTE>, and of <HI>Origen</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Orig. <HI>in</HI> Gen. 18.</NOTE> before him, that <HI>Abraham</HI> is the first per|son called Old in the Scripture, tho <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Methuselah</HI> and many others were richer than he in years, but not in Faith and Obedience. I know, that some of the worst of men have, without this, flourished long, and some that have been most <HI>Religious,</HI> have withered quickly.; and therefore do conclude, that all such <HI>Outward blessings</HI> and <HI>afflictions</HI> are <HI>conditionally</HI> promis'd and threatned: and yet it abides certain, that the <HI>ordi|nary</HI> way to a vigorous <HI>Age,</HI> and a long Life, is the true fear of God; and that which makes it short and miserable, is <HI>Ungodliness.</HI> And the <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> is ex|press herein, <HI>Prov.</HI> 10. 27. <HI>The fear of the Lord prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortned.</HI> For doubtless, <HI>our Lord God,</HI> who is the giver of Life, is also the <HI>Conserver</HI> of it; and whose word we may rely upon, as the best Prescrip|tion and Preservative in this case. This Holy course doth contribute to this end</P>
<P N="1">1. In a <HI>Natural</HI> way. And that, 1. By Mortifying and discarding those <HI>Sins</HI> which do more directly hurt the Body. Such are those <HI>Passions</HI> and <HI>Excesses</HI> above|named, such is <HI>Anger, Envy, Covetous|ness,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="22" MS="y">
<HI>Ambition,</HI> and many such like, which like wind in the Intrails of the Earth do rend and shatter it. I think there is no Sin, whatsoever, but it hath a malig|nant influence upon the Body; either to disorder and inflame it, or to macerate and dispirit it: Now the <HI>Fear of God</HI> obliges a man not only to <HI>restrain,</HI> but to <HI>pluck up</HI> all such by the Roots. Those are the <HI>Weeds,</HI> which both rob the sweet Flowers of their nourishment, and also depauperate the soil where they grow; which being cast out, the whole man fares the better after them. And 2. True Piety refresheth the Body with the <HI>Comforts</HI> of a <HI>good Conscience.</HI> That Peace, that Hope, that Joy which result from a Conscience, that is pacifi'd by the Blood, and purified by the Spirit of <HI>Christ,</HI> do most efficaciously cherish the whole man, they daily feast him. This is that <HI>merry Heart,</HI> that is called a <HI>continual feast,</HI> Prov. 15. 15. And that <HI>doth good like a Medicine,</HI> Prov. 17. 22. There is that <HI>Intimacy</HI> between the Soul and the Body, that whatsoever refresheth the <HI>one,</HI> doth also cheer the <HI>other.</HI> Whereupon the <HI>Learned</HI> have judged, that <HI>Hope, Love</HI> and <HI>Ioy</HI> are great prolongers of <HI>Life,</HI> by the influence which these have upon the
<PB N="35" REF="22" MS="y">
Humours and Spirits in the Body: much more when these Affections have hea|venly and eternal things for their Object: and the <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> speaks that way, when it saith, <HI>Prov.</HI> 19. 23. <HI>The fear of the Lord tendeth to Life, and he that hath it, shall abide satisfied.</HI> 3. True Piety is the best Preservative against Old-age in a <HI>Spiritual</HI> way, to wit, by Procuring the <HI>Blessing</HI> of God. For when the Body is consecrated to him, and imployed for him, we may expect it to be blessed by him; it is under his peculiar care and Providence. When it is united to <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> it will receive influence from <HI>Him</HI> for its good. So that <HI>true Religiousness,</HI> tho it more immediately tend to the re|covery and felicity of the <HI>Soul,</HI> yet it is really most friendly also to the <HI>Body.</HI> He that <HI>feareth God,</HI> and <HI>walketh in his ways, shall see his Childrens Children,</HI> Psal. 128. last. And on the other hand, all those destroying, and life-shortning Diseases mention'd, <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. 27. 61. even <HI>every sickness,</HI> and <HI>every plague,</HI> are denounced to the ungodly. And fully <HI>Eccl.</HI> 8. 12, 13. <HI>Tho a Sinner do Evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him. But it shall not be well with the wick|ed,</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="23" MS="y">
<HI>neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he feareth not be|fore God.</HI> Therefore you that would <HI>protract</HI> the time of your flourishing strength, learn to love and fear God, devote your selves to him, bestow your Hearts upon him, imploy your time and strength to please and honour him: abide not in a State of <HI>ungodliness,</HI> rest not with a <HI>form of Godliness;</HI> but resolve upon that <HI>Real Holiness,</HI> which will produce a long and happy life in this World, and a longer and happier life in a better.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Second Preservative</HI> against <HI>Old|age,</HI> which indeed is contained in the <HI>for|mer,</HI> is <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Sobriety</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Pugnan|dum tan|quam con|tra morbum est, sic con|tra senectu|tem. Haben|da ratio valetudinis: utendum exercitatio|nibus modi|cis.

I mean that <HI>gracious Vertue, which retains the Sensi|tive Appetite within the bounds of Reason and Religion,</HI> whereby we keep a <HI>Medio|crity</HI> in the use of <HI>Meats,</HI> both in respect to their <HI>Quantity,</HI> neither loading nor pi|ning the Stomack; and in respect of their <HI>Quality,</HI> neither debauching it by too much Variety, nor injuring it by things noxious. The same care in <HI>Drinks,</HI> lest the <HI>Quality</HI> of them be pernicious, or the <HI>Quantity</HI> of them prejudicial. That the <HI>Marriage-bed</HI> be moderately used, so that the vital Spirits be not exhausted. Now <HI>mans</HI> sinful Nature above all other Crea|tures
<PB N="37" REF="23" MS="y">
inclines to <HI>excess</HI> in all these: and it is pleasant to the Flesh; but it is the pleasure&punc; of poyson: At last they <HI>bite like a Serpent, and sting like an Adder,</HI> Prov. 23. 32. not the Soul only, but the Bo|dy. They do insensibly, but infallibly weaken nature, disorder the Harmony of the parts, breed the most fatal distempers, and render him, as we may daily observe, <HI>old</HI> in <HI>infirmities,</HI> that is but <HI>young</HI> in <HI>years.</HI> So that if they who give themselves up to <HI>Gluttony, Drunkenness</HI> or <HI>Lasciviousness,</HI> did truly love their own Souls, or yet their own Bodies, they would bridle their un|ruly Appetites for their own sakes, and not pay so dear for that which must be re|pented of. And as a plain and even <HI>way</HI> is much more delectable, than always to be going up Hill and down; so certainly there is a thousand times more ease and sweetness in an even and <HI>temperate course,</HI> than in the perpetual unevenness of in|temperance. How should that body hold out, that is daily clogg'd and inflam'd with preternatural excesses? The intem|perate man is constantly feeding an <HI>Ene|my,</HI> whom it is charity to starve; and deals with his Body as the <HI>Ape,</HI> who is said to hugg her <HI>young</HI> to death. Where|as a wise <HI>Sobriety</HI> is <HI>health to the Navel,</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="24" MS="y">
and <HI>marrow to the Bones;</HI> by it the Hu|mours, the Blood, the Spirits are all main|tain'd in order and in vigour. His meals are pleasant, and his sleep is sweet, and he is a Stranger to those crudities, and consequent distempers which pester others. Thus <HI>Plato</HI> by his careful tem|perance spun out his life, tho a <HI>great Student,</HI> till he attain'd above <HI>fourscore;</HI> and <HI>Galen</HI> to above <HI>sevenscore years;</HI> and <HI>Seneca</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sen.</HI> Ep. 58&punc;</NOTE> concludes, that there is no way to retard Old-age like a frugal Sobriety.</P>
<P>Let me then persuade all such, as are <HI>lovers of pleasures,</HI> more than lovers of God or of their own Souls, to have some pity on their poor <HI>Bodies.</HI> O break off your destructive Course, sow not the Seeds of consuming Maladies in your own Flesh. <HI>Be not among Wine-bibbers, amongst riotous eaters of Flesh. Put a Knife to thy Throat, if thou be a man given to Appetite,</HI> Prov. 23. 1. 20. <HI>Give not your Strength unto Women, nor your ways to that which destroyeth Kings,</HI> Prov. 31. 3. Let not the <HI>Beast</HI> captivate the <HI>Man,</HI> nor your <HI>Reason</HI> be enslav'd by <HI>Sense;</HI> but re|cover a just dominion over your blind and brutish affections, that your days may be <HI>long and lively</HI> in the Land which the Lord giveth you.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="24">If it be here <HI>Objected,</HI> that the most Re|ligious and temperate persons grow old as soon as others. It is <HI>Answered,</HI> that tho in these <HI>external</HI> things, <HI>all things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked;</HI> yet every wise man will take the likeliest course for the blessing he desires. Tho some Children that have had no good <HI>Educa|tion,</HI> nor good <HI>Example,</HI> have afterward proved eminent men; yet who but a desperate man will hereupon resolve, I will take no care about the <HI>instruction</HI> of my Children? but the prudent Parent will conclude, tho some of the best Edu|cation do miscarry, and some with the worst do flourish, yet I ought and will take the <HI>likeliest</HI> course to bring up my Children in the fear of <HI>God:</HI> Even so in this case, the <HI>Old-age</HI> and Death do seize upon divers pious and circumspect per|sons, as soon or before they come upon others, yet is it the <HI>Interest</HI> and <HI>Duty</HI> of all such as regard God, or wish well to themselves, to use the <HI>fittest means</HI> to pre|serve their strength and vigour, until their time and work be done.</P>
<P>For it is certain, that when the suc|cess answers not the means, and that Distempers, notwithstanding our Piety
<PB N="40" REF="25" MS="y">
and Sobriety, do overtake us; then it is permitted and ordained by the Wisdom of <HI>God</HI> for the setting forth some way of His <HI>Glory,</HI> and for the <HI>real Good</HI> of the party affected. For an Holy and Good <HI>God</HI> never makes <HI>Exceptions</HI> to his <HI>Gene|ral Rules,</HI> but in <HI>Cases reserved</HI> for his greater honour, and his Servants greater good.

the <HI>effect</HI> of Sin, and the <HI>cause</HI> of Sin, and <HI>Sin</HI> it self.

<P>Strive therefore against this infirmity: pray earnestly unto God for a <HI>meek and quiet Spirit:</HI> connive at smaller slips; be not severe against <HI>involuntary</HI> faults: expect not the same Wisdom or Circum|spection in young people, as you have in so long time attained: bridle the <HI>first</HI> emotions of anger; and weigh the <HI>na|ture</HI> and <HI>quality</HI> of a miscarriage, before you let fly at it, and do not kill a <HI>Flea</HI> upon the Forehead of your Child or Ser|vant with a <HI>Beetle.</HI> Learn of <HI>Plato</HI> an <HI>Heathen,</HI> who being incensed at his Ser|vant, desir'd his Friend <HI>Xenocrates,</HI> who

But their talent lies not that way, but rather like <HI>Zoilus</HI> of old, who being asked, why he carped so much at others, answer'd, that <HI>he spoke ill of them, because he could do no other ill to them;</HI> so the impotence of old people must be a plea for their ill lan|guage: but God will <HI>reprove thee,</HI> and <HI>set this</HI> and <HI>all thine other</HI> sins before thee, because <HI>thou sittest and speakest</HI>

<P>THE <HI>Third Sin</HI> more peculiar to <HI>Old|age,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect; 3. Envy.</NOTE> is <HI>Envy,</HI> which is <HI>an inward Grudging at those who do in any thing excell us.</HI> Now because they which are <HI>Old</HI> do see many that surpass them in strength, beauty, riches or esteem, they are too apt to look at them with an envious Eye, and to grudge them those blessings, which God hath vouchsafed them. Hence
<PB N="51" REF="30" MS="y">
it is but too usual with them, to lessen their deserts, to carp at their enjoyments, to abound in all such reports and stories, as may degrade or blacken them; think|ing by a great mistake, that what is <HI>de|tracted</HI> from others, is <HI>added</HI> to them|selves. Thus when an House is decay|ing, all the props men can get, they will buttress it up withall: but these are but rotten Pillars, and will but expose you to more contempt.</P>
<P>For this is an <HI>odious sin</HI> in it self: from hence proceeded the <HI>Fall</HI> of the <HI>first Adam,</HI> and the <HI>Death of the Second,</HI> for which mischiefs we should hate it the more. And indeed it is a very unreasonable thing to envy those mercies to others, whereof we have had our share as well as they. Are they strong, comely or respected? You have in your time partaken of them, and why should you grudge at those that do but come after you? It is like as if the <HI>Southern Husbandman,</HI> who hath inn'd his Harvest in <HI>Iuly,</HI> should repine at them that live more <HI>Northerly,</HI> whose Harvest is in <HI>September:</HI> why, the <HI>former</HI> had his Harvest as well as the <HI>Other;</HI> and hath reason rather to be thankful to <HI>God,</HI> than to envy them that follow him. Besides, would you have two Harvests? What
<PB N="52" REF="31" MS="y">
answer can you give to our <HI>Saviours</HI> questions, <HI>Matth.</HI> 20. 15. <HI>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own? is thine eye evil, because I am good?</HI> He that grudges at Gods gifts, would make a miserable distribution of them among men, if they were at his disposal.

<P>And therefore labour with all your might to extinguish this <HI>cursed flame.</HI> Remember that <HI>wrath killeth the foolish man,</HI> and <HI>that envy slayeth the silly one, Iob</HI> 5. 2. You envy <HI>others,</HI> but you hurt your <HI>selves.</HI> Few sins have a more ma|lignant influence upon <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Body,</HI> than this Sin of Envy.

<P>Let him who is infinitely wise have liberty to dispose his gifts as he plea|seth: and instead of grudging at the excellencies of others, labour you for something in your selves to ballance them.

<P>Besides, you should consider, that we are all <HI>fellow-members</HI> of the same bo|dy, and so we should rejoyce in their welfare and in their comforts; that's the way to bring them to sympathize with us in our defects; and they that pay respect to those <HI>above</HI> them, shall most usually receive it from them <HI>be|low</HI> them; whereas the <HI>Envious</HI> man takes pleasure only in punishing of him|self.</P>

<PB N="63" REF="36" MS="y">
Alas, your Riches will be no certain refuge for you, <HI>Prov.</HI> 18. 10, 11. <HI>The Name of the Lord is a strong Tower: the Righteous runneth into it and is safe. The Rich mans Wealth is his strong City, and as an high wall</HI> (but 'tis only) <HI>in his own conceit.</HI> That bond, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 5. sealed to us, is worth all your Special|ties, and all your Estates: He hath said, <HI>I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</HI> Can you justifie your immoderate scrap|ing by a just provision for <HI>your Chil|dren</HI> and Relations? No, no, That's but an excuse; for they that have no Chil|dren, are as sick of this Disease as others. But if you have Children, this course of yours is the way to undo them. A moderate care for Posterity, is a Duty, wherein we may expect a Blessing: but the <HI>Covetousness</HI> of the Parent, doth but provide for the <HI>Luxury</HI> of the Child, and so the Parents Soul is ruin'd in the <HI>getting,</HI> and the Childs in the <HI>spending</HI> of what is so gotten. If your posterity fear God, they shall want no good thing, they shall have <HI>enough:</HI> but if they do not, they will have <HI>too much.</HI> God will be dishonoured, and themselves undone for ever.</P>
<P>Neither will religious <HI>purposes</HI> of do|ing
<PB N="64" REF="37" MS="y">
some <HI>Good</HI> with your Estates, ex|cuse your present penuriousness: for that is to do evil that good may come of it. Hear what <HI>God</HI> himself saith to this, <HI>Isa.</HI> 61. 8. For <HI>I the Lord love judg|ment, I hate robbery for a burnt Offering.</HI> They that will part with nothing while they <HI>live,</HI> nothing will be accepted from them when they <HI>dye. Plead</HI> not your unspotted Justice, Honesty and Equity, against this charge; as if a Man could not be <HI>covetous,</HI> that meddles only with <HI>his own.</HI> For tho fraud, injustice and oppression be sometimes the <HI>Effects,</HI> yet the <HI>Nature</HI> of covetousness stands in <HI>over|loving the World;</HI> and so you may be damnably guilty of this Sin, tho you keep you within the limits of your Estate. For as a man may be guilty of uncleanness with his <HI>own</HI> Wife, and be drunk with his <HI>own</HI> drink, so a man may be covetous with his <HI>own</HI> Riches. We do not find that the <HI>rich Fool, Luk.</HI> 12. nor that the <HI>rich Glutton, Luk.</HI> 16. did other folks wrong; nor those on the left hand of <HI>Christ, Mat.</HI> 25. that they robb'd the poor or wrong'd the needy, but yet all guilty of this accursed vice.</P>
<P>Strive therefore to break this snare; And to this end, 1. Consider these few
<PB N="65" REF="37" MS="y">
things, namely, The absolute <HI>Vanity</HI> of all these worldly things; that is, they are not able to satisfie the Mind, or to cure the Body, or to imbelish your Name, or to lengthen the Life, or to save the Soul: and all this hath been prov'd, and concluded by <HI>Solomon</HI> a King of vast <HI>knowledge</HI> and <HI>experience.</HI> And their Va|nity is yet further seen in their <HI>uncertain|ty,</HI> there being an hundred ways to rend them from you, and as many ways to rend you away from them. And are they not vain then? And why <HI>wilt thou set thine Eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly make themselves Wings, they fly away as an Eagle to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ards Heaven,</HI> Prov. 23. 5. Consider again the <HI>End</HI> for which these things are bestowed upon you, which is, that you should imploy them, and use them for him. God doth hereby try you, whether you will deny your self, whether you will glorify him, whe|ther you will lay out your Talent, or lay it up. He makes some persons <HI>poor,</HI> that he may exercise their patience and humility; and others <HI>Rich,</HI> to exercise their bounty and their charity. In short, Riches were never given to any man to spend upon his Lusts, or to hoard them up without just cause; but to <HI>do</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="38" MS="y">
<HI>good withal,</HI> first to your selves, then to your Families and Relations, and then to others: when they are not thus im|ploy'd, you utterly pervert the End for which you are intrusted with them. Consider also, that you are but <HI>Stewards</HI> in your Estates, and you must give a just account of them to him. All that you possess is <HI>His Stock</HI> only in your Hands, it is not your own. <HI>The Earth is the Lords, and the fulness of it.</HI> If you really believed this, you would never pinch or grudge to your self or others, that which is convenient. For what is it to a Steward, when his Lord and Ma|ster shall order him to abate so much to his Tenant, or pay so much to another poor man? He sticks not at it, he knows it will pass in his account, and there's an end. And why cannot you, who are only Stewards to the God of Heaven and Earth, of that Estate which is in your hand, when you can discern that he re|quires it; I say, why cannot you give, forgive, lend, lay out freely, for none of it is your own? and whether will it pass better in your accounts; so much left in Bags or Bonds, or to a prodigal Heir; or so much of it spent in hospi|tality, so much in well-plac'd bounty,
<PB N="67" REF="38" MS="y">
and so much in prudent charity? And lastly, consider the plain <HI>Command</HI> and blessed <HI>Promise</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in that fore|said, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 5. <HI>Let your Conversati|on be without Covetousness&mdash;For he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</HI> q. d. Thou shalt have <HI>that</HI> which is <HI>sufficient,</HI> or, thou shalt have <HI>him</HI> that is <HI>All-sufficient.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Pray earnestly against this Sin.</HI> Let your Eyes be ever towards the Lord, to pluck your Feet out of this Net. Without his divine Grace, this snare will be too strong for you. There are <HI>Medicines</HI> to purge choler, and such Hu|mours which feed our Corruptions, but none to purge Covetousness: No, this Lust is rooted only in the Soul, the bodily Complexion is very little con|cern'd: and therefore you have the more need to cry earnestly to God with <HI>Da|vid,</HI> Psal. 119. 36. <HI>Incline my Heart un|to thy Testimonies, and not to Covetous|ness.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>Labour for Faith.</HI> To believe what <HI>God</HI> hath revealed, and to rely upon what he hath promised. I have read of a <HI>certain Person,</HI> that in a change of times, after some debate about what was then impos'd, swore <HI>by his Faith,</HI> he must live;
<PB N="68" REF="39" MS="y">
but <HI>another</HI> of the same Cloth answered, that he would learn to <HI>live by his Faith:</HI> so when you plead for your selfish pe|nurious course, that you <HI>must live,</HI> I counsel you to learn the <HI>life of Faith:</HI> for if you did believe the <HI>Revelation</HI> which <HI>God</HI> hath made of his <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Covenant,</HI> if you did believe the <HI>Iudg|ment</HI> to come, and the everlasting World after it, if you did believe the <HI>Promises</HI> or the <HI>Threatnings,</HI> which referr to this affair, you would readily despise all the things of this World, and set your affe|ctions on things above; you would, as you ought, be rich in good works, <HI>rea|dy to distribute, willing to communicate, laying up in store for your selves a good foundation against the time to come,</HI> that sith this life is slipping from under your feet, you may <HI>lay hold on eternal Life,</HI> 1 Tim. 6. 18, 19.</P>

<P>AND these are the most <HI>proper Sins</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect; 6. Other Vices of Old-age.</NOTE> of <HI>Old-age:</HI> some <HI>other</HI> there are, which because they are neither so <HI>com|mon</HI> to all ancient people, nor yet <HI>pecu|liar</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="39" MS="y">
to them, and yet are more often found in them than in others, I shall not wholly conceal them, but rather more briefly handle them. Which are,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Craftiness,</HI> which is <HI>Prudence dege|nerate.</HI> Old people have had much deal|ing in the World, and have seen, yea, perhaps felt the effects of other mens sinister Carriage; and being too much devoted to a selfish interest, do thereup|on too often strain a point of equity and integrity, to compass their own ends. If this subtilty were only imployed for their own <HI>security,</HI> it were less culpa|ble; but when it is an <HI>Engine</HI> to <HI>insnare,</HI> or to <HI>over-reach</HI> their Brother, it is inex|cusable. When a Crafty old Miser, hath a young Prodigal in his Tallons, what work doth he make with him? What cunning arts, what tricks and stratagems hath he to distill his Estate into his own Coffers? But this is a baseness unbecom|ing a <HI>Moral Heathen,</HI> who would put himself into anothers case, and deal with him as he would be used by him: how enormous then is it for a Christian, that ought by no means to live to himself, that should remember he is but a Stran|ger in this Earth, and is seeking a better Country, that is a professour of self-de|nial and sincerity!</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="40">Beware therefore of this unworthy Trade: believe, that what you save or gain by indirect ways, brings to you a <HI>Curse</HI> along with it; resolve, that if you cannot stand by <HI>plain dealing,</HI> to fall with it, your fall will be glorious. <HI>Esau</HI> was a <HI>cunning</HI> Fellow, but <HI>Iacob</HI> was a <HI>plain man,</HI> and so should all his Off-spring be. But if you will needs be exercising your Talent, imploy it in a wise con|triving, which way to do good to your Neighbour. So did St. <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 16. <HI>Being crafty, I caught you by Guile,</HI> but he sought not <HI>theirs,</HI> but <HI>them.</HI> You may also exercise your utmost prudence, in the <HI>preserving</HI> your outward Estate and Credit; provided always, you do it not out of an inordinate affection to these things, nor to the <HI>injury</HI> or <HI>prejudice</HI> of any other: for that which doth <HI>harm</HI> to your Neighbour, will never do <HI>good</HI> to you, there being a just <HI>God</HI> that, <HI>Iob</HI> 5. 13. <HI>taketh the wise in their own Craftiness, and the counsel of the froward is carried head|long.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Unteachableness.</HI> When the fault is only in the <HI>understanding</HI> or <HI>memory,</HI> it is rather matter of pity, but when it is in the <HI>will,</HI> it is highly criminal. Now this is a fault very incident to <HI>Old-age,</HI> yea,
<PB N="71" REF="40" MS="y">
the more ignorant, the more obstinate <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>. Hence we read, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 4. 13. of <HI>an old and foolish King,</HI> who <HI>will no more be admonish|ed.</HI> They think it a disgrace to learn; they are more ready to <HI>teach,</HI> than to <HI>learn.</HI> It's grown proverbial, <HI>They are too old to learn.</HI> Indeed if the things propounded be unnecessary and useless, you may safely remain in your ignorance; but if they be proper either to your ci|vil or spiritual Calling, it is a greater shame to be ignorant of them, than to learn them: especially in the great Points that are <HI>necessary to Salvation.</HI> How many instructive Discourses have you heard about these things, and how little have you learn'd? You have your Lesson to get, and your Master is just coming.</P>
<P>O therefore <HI>begg of God</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> to teach you, and do not grudge to take somewhat the more pains to redeem your former negligence. <HI>Cato</HI> learn'd the <HI>Greek Tongue,</HI> when he was an <HI>Old man:</HI> and <HI>Solon</HI> <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> glories in this, that he was <HI>still learning something in his Old-age.</HI> How many famous <HI>Divines</HI> have learn'd the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew</HI> in their <HI>Old-age?</HI> Why should you think your selves too wise or too good or too old to learn what|soever
<PB N="72" REF="41" MS="y">
may make you more useful here, or more happy hereafter? It will be small comfort for you to say, I <HI>am rich,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quid mise|rius misero non mise|rantem seip|sum?</NOTE> and <HI>have need of nothing,</HI> when you shall be found at last, to be <HI>poor, and blind, and naked.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Implacableness</HI> is charg'd as a fault common with Old People. That is, such a <HI>deep resentment</HI> against such as of|fend them, as is scarce abolished. On the one hand, their <HI>impotence</HI> is such, by reason of their Age, that they cannot easily revenge themselves; and on the other, their thinking, Sedentary, and wakeful condition gives, them opportu|nity to rowl their disgusts in their minds, till they are boil'd into a settled rancour. Thus they who in <HI>malice</HI> should be <HI>Chil|dren,</HI> and in <HI>understanding</HI> should be <HI>Men,</HI> are on the contrary <HI>men in malice,</HI> and <HI>Chil|dren in understanding:</HI> not apt to forgive, not easie to forget. What an impla|cable Spirit was in <HI>Aristides</HI> and <HI>Themi|stocles</HI> of old in <HI>Athens,</HI> until the wisdom and integrity of the <HI>former,</HI> did some|what asswage it for a time in the <HI>latter?</HI> The melancholly and stiffness of <HI>Old-age,</HI> will not suffer such impressions to wear off, and their Humour disposes them to aggravate things to the utmost. So
<PB N="73" REF="41">
that the contentions of Old People, like those among Brethren, are <HI>like the Bars of a Castle.</HI> They will owe a Man an ill|turn seven long years together, and then pay him at last.</P>
<P>But this is an inhumane, and ungod|ly temper. Would you have every one deal so by you? have you offended no body in all your course? What <HI>Brute</HI> is it, that continueth an everlasting Rage? Would you be so treated by the great <HI>God,</HI> when you have offended him? How can you pray in this condition without <HI>Cursing</HI> your selves? If you do not forgive, you cannot be forgiven. I am sure the affronts and injuries which you have received <HI>from men,</HI> are not to be compared to those which you have offered <HI>to God.</HI> Away then with this devilish Distemper; make your Neigh|bour sensible of his offence, by a <HI>cool re|presentation</HI> of it to him, by your self if possible, or else by some fit Friend, perhaps you may gain him. By <HI>revenge</HI> you can be but <HI>even</HI> with him, but hereby you'l get <HI>above</HI> him, and <HI>conquer</HI> him. However do not you punish your self for his aversion, by suffering a Fire in your Bosom, which will hurt your own Soul, more than it doth your Neigh|bour.
<PB N="74" REF="42">
And do not nullifie all the good that is in him, nor all the kindness that you have received from him, but muster up all his worthy qualities, and all the former respects and benefits that you have received from him, and this will melt you into a better temper. And especially make it your earnest <HI>request</HI> unto <HI>God,</HI> to root up this Gall and Wormwood out of your Heart, and that he would make you <HI>tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven you.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Speculative wickedness</HI> is another Sin too incident to <HI>Old-age.</HI> That is, either <HI>Reflecting</HI> upon <HI>former</HI> Sins, or <HI>Fancying others</HI> with delight. There is a <HI>Three|fold</HI> complacence in sin; <HI>before</HI> its com|mission, by <HI>contrivance; in</HI> the Com|mission by present <HI>satisfaction,</HI> and <HI>after</HI> the Commission <HI>by remembrance:</HI> and as the set purpose before, so the delight|ful <HI>reflexion</HI> afterwards, is a Sin before God. Now weakness of Body, poverty in Estate, or other impediments may hinder <HI>Old people</HI> from those Exorbitan|ces, which they inwardly love, or in which they have heretofore actually lived: but yet they <HI>ruminate</HI> on them with pleasure, and <HI>Re-act</HI> them in their
<PB N="75" REF="42" MS="y">
fancy. They do not, and perhaps they cannot now profane the <HI>Lords day</HI> as they have done, fight and quarrel as they have done, nor commit uncleanness as they have done, nor drink and debauch themselves as they have done: but they can reflect upon these things with <HI>content;</HI> strength and opportunity is wanting, but their Hearts are as wicked as ever. Hence it is, that you shall hear divers <HI>Old</HI> peo|ple rehearsing their former disobedience to Parents, their refractoriness to their Masters, their petty purloynin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s, and other extravagances, with as fresh delight as they were at first committed.</P>
<P>Now this is in effect to act over those Sins again: <HI>Ezek.</HI> 23. 19. <HI>She mul|tiplied her Whoredoms in calling to remem|brance the days of her Youth, wherein she had plaid the Harlot in the Land of Egypt.</HI> Yea, perhaps this guilt will be found in some respects <HI>greater</HI> than the <HI>first:</HI> be|cause it's likely that <HI>then</HI> there was <HI>less knowledge,</HI> and <HI>more temptation,</HI> than <HI>now</HI> there is. This contemplative wickedness nails on the former guilt, and contracts more: this demonstrates, that the man would be always sinning, if he could; and that he is a meer stranger to true Repentance. I deny not, but that the
<PB N="76" REF="43" MS="y">
first sudden glance of the memory upon former Vanities may be pleased, but 'tis only a surprize; every pious Soul hath them still in <HI>remembrance,</HI> and is <HI>humbled in it.</HI> Thus <HI>Holy Augustine</HI> in his <HI>Con|fessions</HI> reflects upon his <HI>Robbing</HI> an <HI>Or|chard</HI> in his younger days, with all the heart-breaking Aggravations imaginable. Thus <HI>Holy David</HI> cryes out, <HI>Psal.</HI> 25. 7. <HI>Remember not the Sins of my Youth,</HI> nor <HI>my Transgressions.</HI> Labour you to write after their Copies; let the remembrance of your former follies be always <HI>bitter:</HI> never dwell upon the thoughts of them, but with a Sigh. O what a Fool, what a Beast have I been! O what have I done! I am <HI>asham'd,</HI> yea, <HI>even confound|ed, because I bear the reproach of my Youth,</HI> Jerem. 31. 19. Make not the Wound to bleed again by rubbing it afresh, lest it fester and grow incurable at length. Let it appear some way, that it is not want of <HI>power,</HI> but want of <HI>will</HI> that makes you Sober. A diligent care to avoid the Sins of your <HI>present Age</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> will be a good proof, that you would not commit the faults that are past, if you were to live over your life again. <HI>A better Life is the best Repentance</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Optima poenitentia, nova vita. <HI>Luther.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>And so much shall suffice upon this
<PB N="77" REF="43" MS="y">
unpleasant but necessary <HI>Subject,</HI> concern|ing, the <HI>Sins</HI> of <HI>Old-age:</HI> which as they should be matter of our hearty <HI>Grief,</HI> so they should be the subject of our ho|ly <HI>Iealousy</HI> and continual <HI>Caution.</HI> For tho perhaps we may not be <HI>guilty</HI> in them all, yet it is as unlikely that we are <HI>clear</HI> in <HI>all.</HI> So that whereinsoever the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> hath in these Papers or otherwise found us out, it is our indispensable du|ty to watch and pray with all seriousness and constancy against the same; and tho they be rooted never so deep, we must mortify and pluck them up, tho we should (they are grave <HI>Seneca</HI>'s words) <HI>pluck our very Hearts up with them</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Projice quaecun&abque; cor tuum lamiant, quae si aliter extrahi ne|quirent cor ipsum cum illis revel|lendum erat. <HI>Sen.</HI> Ep. 51.</NOTE>. For as one Disease is sufficient to kill the <HI>Body;</HI> so any one Sin unmor|tified, is able to send <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Soul</HI> in|to Hell. On the other hand, it will be one special token, that we are upright before God, when we keep <HI>our selves from our own Iniquity,</HI> Psal. 18. 23.</P>
<P>And yet this is but the one <HI>half</HI> of our bounden <HI>Duty.</HI> For if you pluck up all the <HI>Weeds</HI> out of your Garden, it will be but a desart place, unless you procure some <HI>Herbs</HI> and <HI>Flowers</HI> therein: so tho we should clear our Hearts of these <HI>Vi|ces,</HI> we shall have but naked and emp|ty

<P>Let it therefore be your Study that are ripe in <HI>years,</HI> to be ripe in <HI>Iudgment,</HI> to be well-grounded in the Knowledge of <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Godliness:</HI> whilest others are heaping up Riches, do you treasure up Knowledge.

So that
<PB N="86" REF="48" MS="y">
as <HI>Reason</HI> is much improved by <HI>Learn|ing,</HI> so is <HI>Faith</HI> by <HI>use</HI> and <HI>experience,</HI> hereby <HI>Recumbence</HI> is advanced into <HI>Ple|rophory.</HI> Thus <HI>Abraham</HI> is represented, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. 19, 20. <HI>Not weak in Faith,</HI> when he was an <HI>hundred</HI> years old, and so <HI>stag|gered not at the promise of God through unbelief.</HI> Tho his years rendred the Promise very unlikely, yet those years had taught him, that the performance would be certain, and so being <HI>strong in Faith, he gave Glory to God.</HI> As <HI>they have heard, so have they seen it in the City of God,</HI> and what they have <HI>often seen,</HI> they may <HI>well believe.</HI></P>
<P>They have seen <HI>the wicked in great pow|er, flourishing like a green Bay-tree, and yet suddenly they have passed away;</HI> and therefore they are not so startled at the <HI>prosperity</HI> of ungodly men, as younger people may be. They have also seen the <HI>righteousness of the upright brought forth as the light;</HI> and so are hir'd to believe, that it shall be <HI>well with the righ|teous,</HI> and it shall go <HI>ill with the wicked</HI> at length. They themselves have been in outward straits and dangers, and then wonderfully preserved and provi|ded for, and doth not this strengthen their Faith? And then in case of spiri|tual

wants and troubles, when their Spirit is overwhelmed, the <HI>Old-man</HI> can say with <HI>Asaph, Psal.</HI> 77. 5. <HI>I have con|sidered the days of old, the years of anci|ent times,</HI> and so prop up their Spirits in their greatest dejections. If you that are <HI>Old</HI> want <HI>Faith,</HI> it is an arrant shame for you. For you have been so often told and assured of the <HI>Veracity,</HI> the <HI>Power,</HI> and the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God; and then you have so often <HI>seen</HI> these <HI>Properties</HI> of his exemplified to others, and to your selves, so many wonders of <HI>Providence</HI> done in your remem|brance, that ye your selves must be the greatest <HI>wonder,</HI> in case you do not be|lieve and trust him. When your Soul is cast down, <HI>you</HI> may do as <HI>David</HI> did, <HI>remember</HI> God <HI>from the Land of Ior|dan, and of the Hermonites, from the Hill Mizar:</HI> that is, you may review the help and comfort which you have had in this and the other place of your Pilgrimage, and so <HI>hope still in God,</HI> that <HI>the Help of his Countenance will be the Health of yours.</HI> Psal. 42. 5, 6, 11.</P>

<P>Let it therefore be your study to <HI>get</HI> and <HI>increase</HI> in all wisdom <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Senectus nostra albes|cat canis sapientiae, non marces|cat carnis vetustate. <HI>Aug:</HI> in <HI>Ps. 112.</HI></NOTE>: chiefly for the attaining everlasting happiness.

For as it would be curious folly to contrive a neat House, and then set it upon a quick-sand; so doubtless all the policy of worldly men to get riches and a name, if they do not truly fear God, is but like an <HI>house upon the sand,</HI> or a <HI>spiders web</HI> in the cieling, which will quickly

vanish. It's true <HI>Wisdom</HI> for every man to chuse the <HI>Chiefest Good</HI> for his ulti|mate <HI>End,</HI> and then to take <HI>Gods Coun|sel how</HI> to obtain it. <HI>I have seen five Princes,</HI> (said Sir <HI>Io.

<P><PB N="97" REF="53">Endeavour also to store your minds with <HI>Prudence</HI> to order your affairs aright. There is no time, or place, or business, but there is use for this; not such con|stant use for <HI>Iustice, Fortitude,</HI> or many other vertues. This will render your gray hairs really comely. I had rather, saith <HI>Nazianzen,</HI> have one <HI>drop</HI> of Pru|dence, than a <HI>Sea</HI> of worldly riches. In|tegrity and Wisdom are good Compa|nions.

<PB N="100" REF="55">
then the <HI>Mercy</HI> hath been conferr'd. They have been tryed with many <HI>Afflictions</HI> from the hand of God, either upon their <HI>Bodies,</HI> as Sickness, Pain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> sometimes by acute, sometimes by chronical Di|stempers; and these have exercised and taught them Patience; or upon their <HI>Souls,</HI> as Desertions, or other Impressi|ons of divine Displeasure, and thereby have learned quietly to <HI>wait for the Sal|vation of God;</HI> or by the <HI>Death</HI> of their dear Consorts or Children; all which, by the blessing of God concurring there|with, have like continual burdens on the shoulder, inur'd and strengthened them in this Excellent <HI>Grace.</HI> The <HI>Aged</HI> Person hath also had many provocations, losses, and injuries from <HI>Men,</HI> which have both tried and tamed his met|tle. He hath been either uncomfortably <HI>Match</HI>'t, whereby his <HI>Patience</HI> hath been put to it every day; or cross'd in his <HI>Children,</HI> or fix't near some unquiet <HI>Neigh|bour;</HI> or harrass'd by a costly and tedi|ous <HI>suit of Law;</HI> any of which have for|ced him to exercise this <HI>Grace:</HI> Or else he hath been smitten in his <HI>Reputation,</HI> or maim'd by some great loss or disap|pointment in his <HI>Estate,</HI> where he hath had no <HI>Remedy but Patience.</HI> I know
<PB N="101" REF="55" MS="y">
these things do too often work the <HI>wrong way,</HI> that is, they produce fretfulness, rage, melancholy, and other dismal ef|fects; but in the upright man, they sor|tifie his Spirits, they break the pride, security and stubbornness of his Soul, and make him by <HI>patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, honour and im|mortality,</HI> and so fit him for <HI>Eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Aged</HI> do or should exceed those that are <HI>young</HI> herein. For the tender shoulders of these cannot well bear these burdens: As <HI>Ephraim</HI> once, so they are like <HI>bullocks unaccustomed to the yoke,</HI> which fret and fume, and are gall'd under the aforesaid tryals: Th&ocirc; the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> hath told us, that <HI>it is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth:</HI> But commonly it is some tract of time, before this yoke is quietly and evenly carried. <HI>Old age</HI> doth most per|fectly teach this lesson. He that in his youth would quickly have answered the <HI>Lye</HI> with his <HI>Sword,</HI> will then answer it with a <HI>smile.</HI> The tears which in our youth we spent upon any trivial occasion, we then reserve for better pur|poses; and we come to learn manners to wait Gods time for the mercies we
<PB N="102" REF="56" MS="y">
desire. Time and trials have taught the <HI>Old-man</HI> to digest hard words, and hard things, rather than to fight it out. Good <HI>David</HI> could better bear <HI>Shimei</HI>'s Curse when he was grown into <HI>years,</HI> than <HI>Nabal</HI>'s Uncharitableness, when he was <HI>younger:</HI> Now it was nothing but kill and slay, at least every Male in <HI>Na|bal</HI>'s house; but afterwards, so <HI>let him Curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David: Who shall then say, Where|fore hast thou done this?</HI> 2 Sam. 16. 10. And those <HI>Disciples</HI> of our Saviour, who in their younger years would have had <HI>Fire</HI> sent from <HI>Heaven,</HI> to revenge the incivility of the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> they in their riper years had learned, when <HI>reviled to bless,</HI> when <HI>persecuted to suffer it;</HI> and to bear all indignities not only with much <HI>patience,</HI> 2 Cor. 6. 4. but <HI>with all patience,</HI> 2 Cor. 12. 12. Such is the effect of <HI>years</HI> and experience by the blessing of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>And you that are in <HI>years</HI> must be in|excusable, if you be defective in this <HI>Grace,</HI> because you have been for a long time <HI>Scholars</HI> under a <HI>Patient Master,</HI> who <HI>hath lest us an Example, that we should follow his steps; who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he suffered,</HI>
<PB N="103" REF="56" MS="y">
<HI>he threatned not,</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 21, 23. You have also read and heard many convincing <HI>Discourses</HI> upon this <HI>Subject;</HI> you have seen the folly and madness of <HI>Impati|ence,</HI> and of <HI>Revenge</HI> in others; and you have had so many Crosses of your own, that it is the absurdest thing imagina|ble for you to be destitute hereof.

We may well feel things as <HI>Mortal men,</HI> (saith Mr. <HI>Hooper</HI>) yet overcome them as <HI>Chri|stian men.</HI> Outward Afflictions may prick us, but yet they should not pierce us.

This will not only bridle your <HI>Tongue,</HI> but quiet your <HI>Mind,</HI> and keep you, when dispossest of all other things, in possession of your own Souls <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Patientia iram tempe|rat, lin|guam frae|nat, men|tem guber|nat, pacem custodit. <HI>Cyprian.</HI></NOTE>: For an impatient man, whilst he is affli|cted by another, even then punishes him|self, and so is his own greatest torment|er. Alas! you must still expect a suc|cession of troubles, and unexpected cross|es, until your Course be finished; and if you escape these from abroad, yet you may find occasion enough for your <HI>Pa|tience</HI> with your own <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Ser|vants,</HI> and perhaps with <HI>nearer Relati|ons;</HI> and though you should miss of these, yet your own <HI>Distempers</HI> will try your <HI>Patience;</HI> when you can nei|ther eat your meat, nor live without it; neither sleep with refreshment, nor lye awake with ease; neither endure company, nor be contented alone; when you will be weary of every place, of

every posture, and without <HI>Patience,</HI> weary of your self: And therefore it greatly concerns you to store your selves with this needful, this useful Grace.</P>
<P>And to that End, Inure your selves unto it <HI>by degrees:</HI> Strive to digest <HI>lesser</HI> wrongs, provocations and losses, which will prepare you to be quiet under <HI>greater.</HI> Whilst others are endeavour|ing to out-wit, or out-power their ad|versaries, be you labouring to overcome your own resentments, to conquer your selves: And then set before you that mirrour of <HI>Patience,</HI> the <HI>Lord Iesus Christ,</HI> who alwayes had <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> on his side, and yet patiently bore the an|ger of God, the reproaches of Men, and the rage of Devils.

<P>THE <HI>Fifth Excellency</HI> that doth or<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect; 5.

The <HI>Aged</HI> man is <HI>Stedfast</HI> in his <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Iudgment,</HI> and not easily un|hinged
<PB N="107" REF="58">
there; he is <HI>Fixed</HI> in his <HI>Will,</HI> and not easily charm'd or drawn from his well-chosen Objects. In respect of God and the things of <HI>Religion,</HI> a per|son in years is or should be like a <HI>Rock,</HI> unmoveable, not like the <HI>Ship</HI> that is tossed to and fro. Having considered and weighed their <HI>Principles,</HI> no world|ly consideration, no plausible harangues, no loss or punishment will induce them easily to alter the same. In respect of <HI>Others,</HI> their <HI>Friendship</HI> being grounded upon a firm bottom is constant, and they have learned to overlook ordina|ry failings, and to put the best sense on the words and actions of a <HI>Friend.</HI> So likewise their <HI>Conjugal Love,</HI> though the frothy <HI>fondness</HI> of it be worn off, yet the strength and <HI>substance</HI> of it is unquestionable and unalterable. And then as to <HI>Themselves,</HI> their <HI>Passions</HI> are by long endeavours so moderated and re|gulated, that as their temper is far more even and uniform, than once it was; so also their <HI>Actions</HI> and course of life are more steady and consistent, than in the dayes of their Vanity.</P>
<P>I will not contend that <HI>all Aged</HI> People excell in this <HI>Stedfastness,</HI> especially when <HI>Dotage</HI> invades <HI>Old-age;</HI> but that gene|rally
<PB N="108" REF="59">
it is so, and universally it should be so; and particular exceptions do al|ways confirm general conclusions: Nor do I conclude that all young People are light and inconstant, but it is too manifest to be denyed, that <HI>Childhood</HI> and <HI>Youth</HI> have usually the large <HI>Sails,</HI> but <HI>Old-age</HI> hath the solid <HI>Ballast,</HI> and and therefore doth sail more steadily and more safely. Every Wind will make impression on the Young Tree, but the <HI>Old Oak</HI> stands firm against the Storms. The young <HI>Horse</HI> may go more <HI>nimbly,</HI> but the tried Beast goes more <HI>stedfast|ly</HI> and <HI>surely.</HI> Youth is the <HI>unsettled</HI> age; the Head unsettled, the Heart unsettled, and the Life unsettled. When the <HI>Wise man</HI> exhorts to <HI>remember our Creator in the days of our Youth,</HI> Eccles. 12. 1. that <HI>word Youth</HI> comes of a root signifying <HI>Choice;</HI> which seems to imply, that Youth is a time wherein Persons are <HI>undeter|mined;</HI> they have their Religion, their Relations, their Vocation to choose; but when a man is crown'd with years, then he is in a <HI>settled</HI> estate: Settled in Judgment, settled in his Purposes, settled in his Practice, and commonly settled in his Comfort: When the Apo|stle <HI>Paul</HI> was near his End, then he could
<PB N="109" REF="59">
say, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1. 12 <HI>I know whom I have be|lieved, and I am perswaded,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>For indeed the <HI>Constitution</HI> and Tem|per of the <HI>Aged</HI> disposeth them hereun|to: Their Sanguine and <HI>Mercurial</HI> days are done; their Phlegm and <HI>Melancholy</HI> further their Stedfastness, either in good or evil. They have seen the World, the vanities and varieties of men and things, of opinions and practices, they have <HI>tried all things,</HI> and therefore are likelier to <HI>hold fast that which is good.</HI> And as there is a wearisomness of the Body, so there is a certain weariness of the Mind, which makes it desirous to be fixt, and to be at rest. And having often heard, read and pondered the things of Religion, and also tasted the real com|fort and sweetness in them, they are not easily either flatter'd, or frighted out of them. Their approach to <HI>Death</HI> adds also to their <HI>Constancy;</HI> why should they through <HI>fear</HI> recede from their <HI>Principles,</HI> that in a short time must <HI>dye</HI> of necessi|ty? Hence that saying of Archbishop <HI>Whitgift, Two</HI> things help men to be resolute in a <HI>good Cause,</HI> namely <HI>Old-age</HI> and <HI>Want of Issue.</HI> And it is recorded, that when all the City of <HI>Athens</HI> yield|ed to the Tyranny of <HI>Pisistratus, Solon</HI>

only oppos'd him; and being interroga|ted by him, what made him have such Confidence, he answer'd, <HI>It was his Old|age:</HI> He knew the <HI>Tyrant</HI> could not de|spise him of many years; and he that cannot lose many years, needs not fear other losses; and so may well be sted|fast and unmovable in his Duty.</P>
<P>Let it be your Care therefore to be <HI>rooted</HI> and grounded in the <HI>Principle</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of true <HI>Piety:</HI> Be not like <HI>Chil|dren tossed too and fro with every wind of Doctrine.</HI> It is an arrant shame for you that are <HI>Old,</HI> to have your <HI>Religion</HI> to chuse, or to change it every month: It is not for you to follow fashions in Re|ligion: But you should be <HI>rooted and built up in Christ, and stablished in the Faith as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving,</HI> Colos. 2. 7. <HI>Ability</HI> and <HI>Stability</HI> should be your peculiar honour. Young Persons may have a <HI>land-flood</HI> of Devotion and Zeal: You ought to pass like a still and constant <HI>River;</HI> you should be <HI>constant</HI> in Prayer, in Watch|fulness, in Charity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> While the good|ness of many young People is <HI>as a morn|ing cloud,</HI> and as <HI>the early dew that passeth away;</HI> your path should be as the <HI>shining light,</HI> that <HI>shineth more and more unto the</HI>

<P>THE <HI>Sixth Grace</HI> wherein <HI>Old-age</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect; 6.

<P>Now this <HI>Grace</HI> is very proper, tho not peculiar to <HI>Old-age.</HI> They <HI>especially</HI> do or ought to excell herein. There is in|deed a <HI>Proverbial</HI> saying, that <HI>Wine is the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vinum lac senum.</NOTE> <HI>Milk of Old-men:</HI> some intemperate men there may be of every age, but <HI>God</HI> for|bid that this <HI>Proverb</HI> should be adaequate to <HI>Old-age.</HI> True it is, that where there be the <HI>decays</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> there is more need of reparation, and that the most reviving means are expedient for that end. Whereupon <HI>Plato</HI> permits ancient<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plato</HI> de le|gibus Dial. 2.</NOTE> persons to drink more liberally, to allevi|ate their troubles, and to soften their Spirits, as Iron is softned by the Fire.

The <HI>Lusts of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eyes,</HI> and the <HI>Pride of Life</HI> have, too usually, their distinct Seasons of <HI>rule,</HI> or at least <HI>molestation</HI> in the Soul of man. And the <HI>First</HI> having had its course in the time of Youth, its reign is expired, and the <HI>Aged</HI> must now combate th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">

other <HI>Two</HI> as well as he can. The De|cays of natural strength are great helps to the <HI>Old-mans Temperance;</HI> he cannot, if he would, Eat and Drink, and act his Lust as heretofore; and altho this <HI>Inability</HI> doth not make him a <HI>Tempe|rate</HI> man, yet hereby the <HI>Discontinuance</HI> of the <HI>Acts</HI> weaken the <HI>Habit;</HI> and his <HI>contentedness</HI> therewith, and his hearty <HI>thankfulness</HI> for this reformation may be accounted <HI>real Temperance</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Habeo se|nectutis magnam gratiam, quae mihi sermonis a|viditatem auxit, potio|nis &amp; cibi sustulit. <HI>Cato</HI> in <HI>Cice|rone.</HI></NOTE>: especially when he can reflect upon his former disorders with Grief, Hatred and Shame. Now they find by experience, that a man may live more comfortably, and health|fully with less Meat, less Drink, and less Sleep, than young people indulge themselves withal: and other carnal pleasures are indifferent to them, because <HI>desire doth fail:</HI> and it is much better and easier to <HI>want</HI> desires, than to ful|fill them; as it is far better not to <HI>Itch,</HI> than to have the pleasure of <HI>scratching</HI> where it <HI>itcheth.</HI></P>
<P>But now the pious <HI>Old person</HI> hath really <HI>crucified the Flesh with the Affecti|ons and Lusts;</HI> His Sins did not leave him, but he hath left them. They have not heard and read the <HI>Scripture</HI> so long in vain, which every where disgraceth

and condemneth all <HI>excess and riot, all Chambering and Wantonness,</HI> and obligeth all Christians to <HI>deny themselves,</HI> and to pluck out the <HI>right Eye</HI> that doth <HI>offend</HI> them. They have found by experience that as true <HI>Vertue,</HI> so true <HI>Satisfaction</HI> is only found in a <HI>Mediocrity;</HI> and that all extremes and inordinacies, are offen|sive both to the Mind and Body. I <HI>said of Laughter, it is mad, and of Mirth, what doth it?</HI> Eccles. 2. 2. This was the Verdict which wise <HI>Solomon</HI> brought in his <HI>Old-age,</HI> when he had <HI>not withheld his Heart from any joy, &amp;c.</HI> yet then he concludes, <HI>all was vanity and vexation of Spirit, and there was no profit under the Sun,</HI> Eccles. 2. 10. Besides, they who have lived long, have seen the woful <HI>Effects</HI> of Drunkenness, Uncleanness, and Lux|ury; how many <HI>Bodies</HI> they have de|stroyed, how many <HI>Estates</HI> and <HI>Families</HI> they have ruined, and what small pity the miserable Spend-thrift meets with in those persons and places, where he hath consumed his substance. These and such like observations have con|tributed to the <HI>Aged</HI> mans <HI>Sobriety,</HI> they have been <HI>Pillars of Salt</HI> to him.</P>
<P>So that any <HI>Licenciousness</HI> in a person of <HI>Years,</HI> as it is most <HI>pernicious</HI> to him,
<PB N="117" REF="63" MS="y">
so it is <HI>intolerable</HI> to him. It makes them the objects both of <HI>laughter, scorn,</HI> and <HI>detestation.</HI> Every <HI>excess</HI> in them debi|litates their <HI>Nature,</HI> sullies their <HI>Reputa|tion,</HI> and shakes their <HI>Grace</HI> exceeding|ly. When <HI>Old people</HI> fall, they fall with a great <HI>weight,</HI> and are crush'd more than younger people, and perhaps they have more difficulty to <HI>rise</HI> again. Far more <HI>excuses</HI> are found for the Lapses of <HI>young</HI> people, than can be pretended by the <HI>Aged;</HI> their faults are <HI>crimes,</HI> and their crimes are <HI>prodigies</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Amor in puero, pudor; in virgine, rubor; in f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|min&acirc;, fur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r; in juvene, ardor; in se|ne, risus. <HI>Epictet.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>Let it therefore be your constant care to keep your selves within the bounds of <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Sobriety.</HI> And that both for <HI>Others</HI> sakes, and for your <HI>Own.</HI> You should be <HI>examples,</HI> O be not <HI>stum|bling Blocks</HI> to younger people.

this Vertue. The instance of <HI>Cornaro</HI> a learned and rich <HI>Venetian</HI> is common, that with a sparing and orderly Diet lived to a great Age with little incon|venience.

<P>THE <HI>Seventh Grace</HI> proper for <HI>Old|age,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect; 7.

It obligeth a man to <HI>Think</HI> the best of every man. <HI>Charity thinketh no evil, believeth all things, ho|peth all things, beareth all things.</HI> By this we are ready to account the <HI>Certain good</HI> things in Others, <HI>better</HI> than they are; the <HI>certain Evils</HI> in others, <HI>less</HI> than they are; the <HI>good</HI> that is but <HI>doubtful</HI> in others, <HI>certain; and doubtful Evils, none</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Charitas dicit alio|ram bona certa, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">lio|ra; certa mala, mi|nora; bona dubia, certa; dubia mala, nulla.</NOTE>.

<HI>Eternal</HI> good of all men. Neither doth it rest there, but shews it self in <HI>Endea|vour,</HI> and that both by <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Deed;</HI> speaking <HI>To</HI> them, <HI>Of</HI> them, <HI>For</HI> them to <HI>God</HI> and man what may conduce thereunto; in their Lips is the <HI>Law of kindness.

<P>And in this <HI>Grace</HI> doth every <HI>good Old</HI> Man and Woman excell. This was the eminent <HI>Grace</HI> of the <HI>Evangelist Iohn</HI> in his <HI>Old-age,</HI> for he lived longer than any of the <HI>Apostles;</HI> and his Swan|like Song still was <HI>Love,</HI> as is evident in all his <HI>Epistles:</HI> yea, some <HI>Church Hi|storians</HI> affirm, that when he could go no longer by reason of his <HI>Age</HI> into the <HI>Christian Assemblies;</HI> yet he was in|stant to be led or carried there, where the substance of what he was able to say, was, <HI>little Children, love one another.</HI> And you may find, how pathetical was <HI>Paul the Aged</HI> in his tender charity to <HI>One|simus,</HI> Philem. 9. <HI>Being such a one as Paul the Aged, for loves sake I beseech thee for my Son</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="66">
<HI>Onesimus.</HI> And this Spirit did continue in the <HI>Ancient Christians</HI> in the <HI>Primi|tive</HI> times <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Occultis se notis noscunt &amp; amant mutu&ograve; pen&egrave; antequam noverint. <HI>Min.

We that did hate one another, saith <HI>Iustin Martyr,</HI> now do live familiarly together, and do pray for our Enemies. In all Ages, as men have increased in <HI>Piety,</HI> they have increased in <HI>Charity,</HI> and come to relent of their rigour and keenness. It was <HI>Age, Experience</HI> and <HI>Consideration,</HI> as well as a <HI>Prison</HI> that melted <HI>Bishop Ridley</HI> to accost his <HI>Brother Hooper</HI> in this manner: <Q>However in some by|matters and circumstances of <HI>Religion,</HI> your <HI>wisdom</HI> and my <HI>Simplicity</HI> hath a little jarred, yet now I sincerely love and imbrace you.</Q> You know <HI>Rehobo|ams Old Counsellours</HI> were for <HI>lenity,</HI> when the young were <HI>stern</HI> and <HI>furious.</HI> It's true, the natural tempers or painful distempers, may incline some <HI>Old</HI> peo|ple to too much <HI>Acrimony;</HI> yet all <HI>Aged</HI> people that are considerate, have taken more degrees in <HI>Charity,</HI> than young people have. It was an Old man in <HI>Gibeah</HI> that had more of this Grace, than all the City besides, <HI>Iudg.</HI> 19. 16.</P>
<P>For besides the advantage they have
<PB N="123" REF="66">
had of Gods holy <HI>Ordinances,</HI> the Scope whereof is to increase our <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Principi|um vitae, fi|des; finis, charitas: haec duo perficiunt Dei homi|nem. <HI>Igna|tius.</HI></NOTE>; they have found by experience, that the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Soul</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> lies not in these lesser matters, that have cau|sed the greatest noise in the World; that every <HI>difference</HI> in Religion makes not a <HI>different</HI> Religion: so that where|soever they see <HI>any thing of Christ,</HI> these they love. Their Consciousness of their own <HI>mistakes,</HI> and of their own <HI>imper|fections,</HI> hath forced them to more charitable thoughts of others. They have observed, that true Grace hath liv|ed in the midst of great <HI>infirmities;</HI> yea, they have found this <HI>Flower</HI> in divers persons, where they thought there had been nothing but <HI>VVeeds.</HI> Being con|versant most at home in their <HI>own Souls,</HI> they have in their long experience disco|vered so much Vanity and Iniquity there, that they are are very charitable <HI>Iudges of all other</HI> persons. They grow like the famous <HI>Pliny,</HI> who so past by others offences, as if himself had been the greatest offender; and yet was so severe to himself, as if he would pardon no body: their <HI>Charity covers a multitude of Sins.</HI> In short, their <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Afflicti|ons</HI> have so happily humbled them, that
<PB N="124" REF="67" MS="y">
they are ready to esteem every one bet|ter than themselves; and so they are far from that uncharitable <HI>Censoriousness,</HI> which tears mens Names in pieces, and keeps up a continual civil War among mankind.</P>
<P>And then for other <HI>Acts of Charity,</HI> who should be more ready to Give <HI>a part,</HI> than they that know they must shortly leave the <HI>whole?</HI> who should be good in his <HI>Stewardship,</HI> but he that is <HI>sure</HI> he must shortly be out of it? But the noblest <HI>Charity</HI> is that which respects the <HI>Soul,</HI> which consists in <HI>Counselling, Perswading, Reproving</HI> and <HI>Praying</HI> for Others. And <HI>Old-age</HI> is evidently quali|fied for these above the young. Their <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> gives them a great advantage herein: and they have found by experience, that sometimes a word of good Counsel and charitable Reproof <HI>fitly spoken, hath been like Apples of Gold.</HI> And then for <HI>Prayer,</HI> it is observed that the Charity of young persons therein, doth begin and end at <HI>themselves;</HI> where|as the Prayers of the Aged are much imployed for the good of <HI>others.</HI> Few Children pray for their <HI>Parents,</HI> as the Parents pray for their <HI>Children.</HI> Yea, they have learned to love and pray for
<PB N="125" REF="67" MS="y">
their <HI>Enemies,</HI> as well as for their <HI>Friends;</HI> and for the <HI>ungodly,</HI> as well as for the <HI>godly.</HI> And the poorest <HI>Old</HI> Man or Woman may be rich, in these acts of <HI>Charity.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore as <HI>ye abound in every thing, in faith, in utterance and knowledge, see that ye abound in this Grace of Charity also.</HI> It is the <HI>Apostles</HI> Exhortation, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8. 7. We use to say, that in Win|ter the natural heat retreats inward, and there resides about the vital parts: ye that are in the <HI>winter quarter</HI> of your life, let this <HI>warm Grace</HI> dwell richly in your Hearts, and then it will influence all your words and actions. It is the <HI>Image</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> for <HI>God is Love;</HI> it is the fulfilling of the <HI>Law,</HI> and it is the great command of the <HI>Gospel;</HI> and tho you have Knowledge, Faith, Wisdom, Riches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet if you have not <HI>Charity,</HI> you are nothing. You are going out of the World, now is your time to exercise this <HI>Grace.</HI> In the World where you are going, there will be no infirmities to cover, no poor to relieve, no injuries to forgive, no ignorant persons to in|struct, no miserable Creature to pray for: and you have but a <HI>short time</HI> for these imployments. Yea, perhaps you
<PB N="126" REF="68" MS="y">
are reprieved all this while for these Services; and to be useful in these and such like ways is the greatest happiness on Earth, it is the next step to eternal Glory. Yea, nothing should hire an <HI>Old</HI> person, or make him content to live out of Heaven with such a Body of Sin about him, but only that they may do <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> that service, which can|not be done in <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>And for the obtaining this sweet <HI>Grace,</HI> the <HI>Scripture</HI> tells us, that it is a <HI>Fruit of the Spirit, Gal.</HI> 5. 22. and <HI>there</HI> it is ranked in the <HI>first</HI> place: It must be sought then in the <HI>Word of God,</HI> which is the <HI>vehicle</HI> of the <HI>Spirit;</HI> where, it being carefully read and heard, we shall find an account of the infi|nite <HI>love of God</HI> to us, and of the stupendous <HI>love of Christ.</HI> There we shall discern how nearly we are rela|ted to all men, especially to all <HI>Chri|stians,</HI> and how unnatural it is for <HI>one hand</HI> to be unkind to <HI>the other.</HI> And in short, we shall there find, that Love and Charity is still the Character of good men, and hatred and uncharitableness of the bad. And you must beg this Grace of God, that the <HI>Spirit of Love,</HI> would plant this Grace of <HI>Love</HI> in your
<PB N="127" REF="68" MS="y">
Hearts. You will feel your hearts warm|ing as you are praying, and the Lord will fill you with this <HI>Charity which is the bond of perfectness.</HI></P>
<P>And so I have done with the <HI>Ver|tues</HI> and <HI>Excellencies</HI> of <HI>Old-age:</HI> Where|by you may perceive that all <HI>Old</HI> things are not to be cast away: But as <HI>Old Wood</HI> is best to burn, <HI>Old Wine</HI> best to drink, <HI>Old Authors</HI> best to read, and <HI>Old Friends</HI> best to trust; so <HI>Old People,</HI> if they have improved their <HI>Time</HI> aright, are good for something <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Old <HI>Fish,</HI> old <HI>Oil,</HI> and an old <HI>Friend</HI> are best. <HI>Ital.</HI> Proverb.</NOTE>; yea are emi|nently good for their <HI>Knowledge,</HI> for their <HI>Faith,</HI> for their <HI>Wisdom,</HI> for their <HI>Patience,</HI> for their <HI>Stedfastness,</HI> for their <HI>Temperance,</HI> and for their <HI>Charity.</HI> And so much for the <HI>Fourth Point</HI> concern|ing <HI>Old-age,</HI> viz.

<P>AND now let us more <HI>distinctly</HI> sur|vey<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 1. It is deprived of Plea|sures.</NOTE> the <HI>Inconveniences</HI> of <HI>Old-age;</HI> the chief whereof are these following.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The <HI>Aged are Deprived of many Pleasures.</HI> They cannot divert them|selves by Hunting, Hawking, Fishing: They can neither well <HI>ride</HI> abroad, nor <HI>walk</HI> about home. They have done with <HI>Visits,</HI> and <HI>Feasts,</HI> and <HI>Musick:</HI> All the recreations of <HI>sense</HI> are generally tastless to them. Yea, they have scarce any pleasure in their <HI>meat,</HI> and <HI>drink,</HI> and <HI>sleep:</HI> So that their Condition seems to be sad and lamentable. And we have the substance of all this confessed by an <HI>Old man</HI> himself, namely <HI>Barzillai,</HI> 2 Sam. 19. 35. <HI>I am this day fourscore years old; and can thy servant tast what I eat, or what I drink? can I hear any more the voyce of singing men and singing women? q. d.</HI> These things will signifie nothing to me; they have forsaken me, and I value them as little. Here you have the Verdict which <HI>Barzillai</HI> brings in the Case. Yea instead of <HI>Pleasure,</HI> a constant <HI>Sadness</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="72">
takes place in their Countenance with|out, and, as may be judged, in their Hearts within. <HI>Sobs</HI> and <HI>sighs</HI> are the accent of their language, and their com|plaints are frequently mixt with <HI>tears.</HI> Their Condition then must needs be miserable, when they have such con|stant heaviness <HI>within,</HI> and no recreati|on <HI>without</HI> to alleviate it. <HI>Company</HI> bur|dens them, and <HI>Solitariness</HI> saddens them. Yea they are loth that any body should be <HI>merry</HI> about them: So that they seem to lead a <HI>dolorous</HI> life, and to be estrang|ed from all manner of Pleasure.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Pleasure</HI> is the <HI>life</HI> of Life: What is Life without Delight? why do men toyl to get Estates, but for the <HI>pleasure</HI> they take in them? why do others hunt for Applause, and climb for Honour, but to <HI>please</HI> their fancy and their hu|mour? even the Schollar would take leave of his Books, if he had not <HI>De|light</HI> in them: So that <HI>Pleasure</HI> acts all mankind, and rules the world. Now those years are lamentable, wherein a man shall say, <HI>I have no pleasure in them.</HI> And this makes some <HI>Old</HI> People wea|ry of their lives, they reckon that a Life stript of joy and comfort, is not worth the keeping.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="72" MS="y">Nevertheless, <HI>Old-age</HI> may support it self very well under this <HI>Inconvenience:</HI> Inasmuch, as the <HI>Pleasures</HI> they are de|prived of, are <HI>in themselves</HI> and <HI>to their experience,</HI> dangerous Injoyments: For nothing is more apt to disorder and fully the Soul, than <HI>carnal Pleasure.</HI> Those very <HI>Recreations</HI> which may be harmless in themselves, yet too commonly lead to <HI>Intemperance,</HI> to <HI>Lasciviousness,</HI> to <HI>Quar|rels,</HI> and other <HI>mischiefs.</HI> Now if a Dish be never so <HI>palatable,</HI> yet if there be but <HI>danger</HI> of Poyson in it, no wise man will meddle with it: Therefore <HI>Tully</HI> brings in <HI>Cato</HI> congratulating with himself, that he was delivered from the <HI>slavery of Pleasure,</HI> and concludes, that it is a singular <HI>Priviledge</HI> of <HI>Old-age,</HI> that it frees us from that which is most <HI>pernicious</HI> in youth <NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Magnum munus sene|ctutis est, quod id no|bis aufert, quod in a|dolescentia est vitiosissi|mum. <HI>Cicer.</HI></NOTE>. And whatever re|gard weak men may have to these Va|nities, the wisest among the very <HI>Hea|thens</HI> have concluded, that there is no plague so deadly to man as the <HI>pleasures of the body</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Nulla ca|pitalior pestis est, quam corpo|ris volup|tas. <HI>Archi|tas Tarent.</HI></NOTE>. And that comes to pass through the <HI>depravation</HI> of our Natures, whereby we can hardly enjoy them, but we run mad upon them; we exceed the <HI>limits,</HI> and miss the <HI>ends</HI> which should be observed in the using of them. Where|fore
<PB N="136" REF="73">
<HI>Cicero</HI> tells of <HI>Sophocles,</HI> who being ask<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d, whether he did still converse with <HI>Womankind,</HI> answered, <HI>The Gods have done better for me, I have willingly left that furious Master</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Dii meli|pra libenter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> tan|quam a Do|mino <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">urioso pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ugi. <HI>Cicer.</HI> de senect.</NOTE>. Indeed the great|est part of the <HI>Pleasures</HI> aforesaid, do belong only to the <HI>brutal</HI> part of man, and consequently the defect of them lit|tle concerns the <HI>Rational</HI> Creature. For, as a late <HI>worthy Author</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Gentle|mans Cal|ling.</NOTE> saith, None can think <HI>God</HI> so unkind to his own Image in humane nature, as in dispensing Feli|city to assign the larger share to the <HI>Beast.</HI> No, all these sensual <HI>Pleasures</HI> are so <HI>distracting,</HI> or so <HI>fulsome,</HI> or so <HI>transient,</HI> that the utmost fruition of them, cannot make a man happy, nor the want of them miserable. And this is the more Evident, in that the <HI>wisest</HI> men have found the <HI>greatest Pleasure,</HI> in refusing those pleasures; and as an <HI>Epicure</HI> hath <HI>eaten</HI> for his pleasure, so many an <HI>Abstemious</HI> man hath profest, that he hath <HI>forborn</HI> for his pleasure also.</P>
<P>Again, as the <HI>Aged</HI> person is deprived of these <HI>Pleasures,</HI> so he is freed from any <HI>Desires</HI> after them. As his sensual <HI>Delights</HI> fail, so his <HI>Desires</HI> to them fail also. As he hath not the Pleasure of
<PB N="137" REF="73">
<HI>Scratching,</HI> so he is free from the trouble of <HI>Itching,</HI> and what man ever complains of such a want? We are never molested by the <HI>want</HI> of any thing, which we do <HI>not desire</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Nihil au|tem mole|stum, quod non deside|ramus. Non caret is, qui non deside|rat. <HI>Cicer.</HI></NOTE>. Neither is <HI>Old-age</HI> without it's particular <HI>Pleasures. Tully</HI> tells us of divers <HI>Old-men,</HI> that diverted themselves with great delight in their <HI>Studies.</HI> And for those that have any smattering of <HI>Learning,</HI> there is no <HI>Earthly</HI> Pleasure comparable to that of penetrating into the works of <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI> of observing the <HI>Natures, Causes,</HI> and <HI>Effects</HI> of those things, the <HI>Surface</HI> where|of only is known to younger people.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the <HI>Religious Old</HI> person hath an unexpressible <HI>Pleasure</HI> in the <HI>Reflexion</HI> of a <HI>well-spent Life,</HI> and upon the various <HI>Preservations</HI> and <HI>Delive|rances,</HI> which the <HI>Lord</HI> hath vouchsafed him, out of many <HI>Temptations</HI> and <HI>Af|flictions.</HI> They have also the solid <HI>com|fort</HI> of seeing their <HI>Posterity</HI> grow up in the endowments of <HI>Mind, Body</HI> or <HI>Estate;</HI> and so of a <HI>Generation</HI> after them to serve and honour God, while the World stands.</P>
<P>There are also several <HI>honest Recreati|ons,</HI> in which their <HI>Years</HI> do not hinder them. And however, it can be no disparagement
<PB N="138" REF="74" MS="y">
to them, if they can take as much <HI>Pleasure</HI> in <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Medi|tating</HI> upon Gods Word, as ever they did in any other <HI>Divertisement</HI> whatsoever <NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Plato.</NOTE>. This is certain, that their <HI>Pleasures</HI> are more <HI>Pure,</HI> more <HI>Sound,</HI> more <HI>Strong,</HI> and more <HI>Lasting,</HI> than the frothy and unsatisfactory pleasures of <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>Sin,</HI> which are but <HI>for a Season.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, <HI>Sickness</HI> of Body or <HI>Trouble</HI> of Mind, to both which the Young are equally obnoxious as the Old, are able to divorce the <HI>youngest</HI> persons from all sensible <HI>Pleasures,</HI> and to cloath their Faces with sadness: so that this <HI>Incon|venience</HI> must not be so appropriated to <HI>Old-age,</HI> but that any Age may partake thereof. Even St. <HI>Augustine</HI> tells us, that in his younger years, he had con|tracted such sadness upon his Spirits up|on occasion of his good <HI>Mothers</HI> Death, that nothing could comfort him. He went into the <HI>Bath,</HI> hoping for some re|freshment thereby, but his sorrow met him when he came out again. A thou|sand <HI>Accidents</HI> may fix such sorrow even upon young people, which all the <HI>Plea|sures</HI> in the World cannot remove.</P>
<P>And tho the consideration of their own and others <HI>Sins,</HI> and of the <HI>Effects</HI>
<PB N="139" REF="74" MS="y">
of them, do make them often <HI>sad,</HI> yet there is both a <HI>secret comfort</HI> at the bot|tom of it, and a <HI>certain Ioy</HI> at the end of it; they know what belongs to the <HI>Laughter of the Soul,</HI> and have frequent tasts of the <HI>joy that is unspeakable.</HI></P>

<P>A <HI>Second Inconvenience</HI> which attends<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect; 2.

P. mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE>. Those <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Hands</HI> which once were able and useful for any imployment, are now scarce strong and steady enough to feed themselves. The <HI>Legs</HI> and <HI>Thighs</HI> that have carried them many a pleasant journey, yea, to many an holy Exer|cise, are grown stiff and weak, and grudge to carry them up Stairs to Bed. Yea, that <HI>Back</HI> which was the support of the whole building, and many a Load that was piled upon it, begins to bow and bend, and can scarce carry it self erect. Their <HI>Parts</HI> and <HI>Members</HI> in ge|neral are quite enervated and spent, as if they were weary of their Imploy|ment; so that there seems to be
<PB N="140" REF="75" MS="y">
left little of a Man but his <HI>Shape:</HI> ac|cording to the <HI>Proverb, Senex est, &amp; non est. He is old, and so is No-body.</HI> Like some ruinated <HI>Palace,</HI> here was the stately Porch, there the fair Stair-case, the shape of a fair Parlour below, and the shadow of an handsome Chamber above: so here, the <HI>Carkass</HI> of the Man remains, but the <HI>Beauty</HI> is changed in|to <HI>wrinkles,</HI> and the <HI>Strength</HI> into <HI>weak|ness.</HI> They had a pleasant prospect in their Glass, but their Flesh hath bid them farewell, their <HI>Roses</HI> and <HI>Lillies</HI> are withered, and a wan duskishness hath taken possession: their Strength and Beauty are buried both together: So that it was a <HI>Saying</HI> among the <HI>Ro|mans, Sexagenarius de ponte dejiciendus. He is sixty, make away with him.</HI></P>
<P>For when a mans <HI>Strength</HI> is gone, he seems to be <HI>useless.</HI> He can neither <HI>defend</HI> himself, nor <HI>help</HI> others. He can neither <HI>fight</HI> in War, nor <HI>labour</HI> in Peace. Whether he be in the <HI>Temple,</HI> or in the <HI>Campaign;</HI> whether he be in the <HI>Shop</HI> or in the <HI>Field;</HI> he is quickly <HI>weary.</HI> He that could run <HI>to Sin,</HI> can hard|ly creep <HI>to Church.</HI> He that had <HI>Strength</HI> to vanquish his <HI>Adversary,</HI> hath now scarce <HI>strength</HI> to wrestle with his <HI>Cough:</HI>
<PB N="141" REF="75">
and the burden of his discourse is, <HI>I have known the time, that I could have done this and that.</HI> Thus <HI>Milo</HI> that pro|digious man of strength, when coming in his <HI>Old-age</HI> to see them exercise in the <HI>Olympick Games,</HI> is said to look down with tears on his own Arms, and to cry, <HI>Alas, these now are dead.</HI> Yet this <HI>Loss</HI> some <HI>Aged</HI> persons can better bear, than <HI>Others</HI> can digest the decay of their <HI>Beauty.</HI> O to be lean, withered, and deformed vexeth them at the Heart. They cannot look upon themselves with <HI>Patience:</HI> and they conclude, that when they be so unwelcome to <HI>themselves,</HI> they must be unacceptable to <HI>every body else,</HI> Job 14. 20. <HI>Thou changest their Coun|tenance, and sendest them away.</HI></P>
<P>But yet neither of these <HI>Inconvenien|ces</HI> are chargeable upon <HI>Old-age</HI> it self. For as <HI>Tully</HI> well observes <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Intempe|rans Ado|lescentia ef|faetum cor|pus tradit senectuti. <HI>Cicer.</HI></NOTE>, the <HI>defects</HI> of strength, whereof we are sensible, do rather proceed from the <HI>Vices of our Youth,</HI> than from the <HI>fault of Old-age.</HI> An intemperate <HI>Youth</HI> transmits a weak body unto the time of <HI>Old-age</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="marg">Ista ipsae defectio vi|rium, adole|scentiae vi|tiis&punc; efficitur saepius, quam senectuti. <HI>Id.</HI></NOTE>, and then we lay all the blame on <HI>Age. Galen</HI> in one place tells us, About the <HI>28th.</HI> year of my Age, when I knew there was a certain way to preserve Health, I
<PB N="142" REF="76" MS="y">
followed the same all my life after, so that I was never Sick but of an Ague for a day, and that seldom, and there|by he was vegete and brisk at <HI>Sevenscore</HI> years of Age. And <HI>M. Valerius Corvi|nus</HI> was strong enough to be the <HI>sixth</HI> time <HI>Consul,</HI> when he was an <HI>hundred</HI> years old. Whereas on the contrary a Luxurious youth, produces a loathsome Age. As the <HI>Thief</HI> in the <HI>Candle</HI> wasts it more than the <HI>Flame;</HI> so any <HI>Intem|perance</HI> or <HI>Incontinence,</HI> doth wast the <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Beauty</HI> more than <HI>years.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is <HI>Old-age</HI> alone subject to these Evils. For one Weeks <HI>Sickness,</HI> to which Youth is as lyable as <HI>Old-age</HI> will ruine your <HI>Strength</HI> and spoil your <HI>Beauty,</HI> as much as <HI>twenty</HI> years time can do. How many are crippled in their Youth? how commonly doth the Small-pox disfigure their beauty! <HI>David</HI> himself complains, <HI>Psal.</HI> 102. 23. <HI>He weakened my strength in the way; he shortned my dayes.</HI> And he cries, <HI>O my God, take me not away in the midst of my dayes.</HI> So that these <HI>Decayes</HI> must not be impropriated to <HI>Old-age;</HI> any Age may be afflicted with them as well as that.</P>
<P>Neither is this <HI>Loss</HI> so insupportable, if we consider the true <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Va|lue</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="76" MS="y">
of these <HI>Mercies.</HI> They are but bo|dily accomplishments; they are not the endowments of the <HI>Soul.</HI> Many <HI>Brutes</HI> surpass the youngest in <HI>Strength,</HI> and many <HI>Flowers</HI> surpass them in <HI>Beauty.</HI> Why should I, saith <HI>Cato in Tully,</HI> now more desire the strength of a Young man, than I should, when young, desire the strength of a <HI>Bull</HI> or <HI>Lyon?</HI> There is the like absurdity in both these desires. Or as <HI>he</HI> saith in <HI>another</HI> place, we may as reasonably in our <HI>Youth,</HI> call back the State of <HI>Childhood,</HI> which few will do, as in <HI>Old-age</HI> to expect the <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Beauty</HI> of youth, which is past and gone. You have, if it be not your own fault, the <HI>Priviledges</HI> proper to your Age, and according to the <HI>Old Observation</HI> it is far better to want the <HI>strength of Milo,</HI> than the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of <HI>Pythagoras</HI> <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Non sunt senibus vi|res; nec po|stulantur vires &agrave; se|nectute. <HI>Ci|cero.</HI></NOTE>. Every Age hath its peculiar <HI>Talent,</HI> to have them in perfection is not to be expected up|on Earth.

<P>But the great <HI>support</HI> under these de|fects is, As <HI>the outward man perisheth, to find the inward man renewed day by day:</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="77">
what the <HI>River</HI> loseth on the one side, it gaineth on the other, and then all's well enough: the <HI>inward</HI> man is the <HI>better</HI> man.

<P>Now this manifest stroke upon their <HI>Faculties,</HI> is a very sensible <HI>Inconvenience.</HI> The Decay of the <HI>Outward man</HI> might be someway tolerable, but this <HI>inward Decay</HI> sinks their Spirits. When holy <HI>David</HI> said, <HI>Psal.</HI> 6. 2. <HI>My bones are vex|ed,</HI> his distress was great, but when he
<PB N="147" REF="78">
adds in the <HI>next verse, my Soul also is sore vexed,</HI> his case was more lamenta|ble. What comfort can a man have, when his <HI>Apprehension</HI> is grown blunt? What's a Knife good for, when the met|tle is gone? When a man can <HI>attain</HI> lit|tle, and <HI>retain</HI> nothing? The deficiency of these is a great impediment in all <HI>hu|mane</HI> affairs, but of greater consequence in <HI>Religious</HI> matters. The Communion which the Soul hath with <HI>God</HI> is in the <HI>Word and Prayer.</HI> How disconsolate must the Heart be, when one can <HI>remember</HI> almost nothing of what he reads or hears? When his <HI>affections</HI> flagg, and his words freeze in <HI>Prayer?</HI> Why, he thinks he has lived long enough, he feels himself more than <HI>half dead</HI> already. The <HI>House</HI> is left standing, but all the rich <HI>Furni|ture</HI> is gone, and what can be said to mitigate this misery, or to reconcile any body to <HI>Old-age?</HI></P>
<P>To stop any further <HI>Impatience,</HI> Con|sider, 1. That this great <HI>Decay</HI> in the <HI>Faculties</HI> doth not befall <HI>every Aged</HI> per|son. Divers there are and have been, that retain the free use of their <HI>Facul|ties</HI> till they dye. How many doth <HI>Tully</HI> name, as <HI>Simonides, Stesichorus, Isocrates, Hesiod, Homer, Pythagoras,</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="79">
<HI>Democritus, Socrates, Plato,</HI> &amp;c. who lived long, and yet continued a course of <HI>Studies</HI> as long as their life? <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">In omni|bus iis stu|diorum agi|tatio vitae aequalis fuit&punc; <HI>Cicer.</HI></NOTE> And <HI>he</HI> tells us there particularly of <HI>Sophocles,</HI> whose <HI>Sons</HI> accused him for a <HI>Dotard</HI> in his <HI>Old-age,</HI> till he before the <HI>Iudges</HI> repeated the <HI>Tragedy</HI> of <HI>Oedipus,</HI> which he had newly written, and so was by them acquitted. And <HI>Seneca</HI> tells of <HI>himself</HI> then in years, that he was able to repeat <HI>Two thousand Names</HI> in Order, so faithfully did his <HI>Memory</HI> stick to him in his <HI>Old-age.</HI> And there are many <HI>Instances</HI> every day of fresh and lively parts in withered Bodies. Yea, for the most part we may observe that accord|ing to the <HI>Old saying, Omnia quae curant Senes meminerunt.</HI> What old people most regard, they best remember. They seldom as <HI>Tully</HI> observes, forget their Bonds, their Mortgages, what they owe, or what is owing unto them, or where they have laid up their Treasure. So that this charge lies not against all <HI>Old people,</HI> nor in all cases.</P>
<P>2. These Decays proceed not from <HI>Old-age only,</HI> but many times from <HI>Sloth</HI> and <HI>Negligence.</HI> Their <HI>Faculties</HI> would continue more intire to them, if they did exercise them with <HI>Study</HI> and <HI>Industry.</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="79">
but the best mettal will rust with dis|use, and the meanest by constant use will be kept bright and in good or|der.</P>
<P>3. The blastingof Parts is not peculiar to <HI>Old-age.</HI> For many <HI>Diseases</HI> and other <HI>Accidents</HI> do often Eclypse our <HI>Facul|ties</HI> as well as <HI>Old-age.</HI> Witness <HI>Messala Corvinus,</HI> who was so weakned in his Head, that he forgot his <HI>own Name.</HI> Yea, many a mans <HI>bad Morals</HI> have spoiled his good <HI>Intellectuals,</HI> before he hath made one step into <HI>Old-age.</HI> And there|fore this misery is not to be confin'd to <HI>Old-age,</HI> which neither attends <HI>all old</HI> people, nor <HI>only</HI> such, nor meerly upon the account of their Age.</P>
<P>4. There is this <HI>Comfort,</HI> that tho all these <HI>Decays</HI> be the <HI>fruit</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> yet in themselves they are rather <HI>Afflictions,</HI> than <HI>Faults,</HI> and so are more ordinable to our good. How much better is the <HI>Decay</HI> of our <HI>faculties,</HI> than the <HI>perver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> use</HI> of them? Nay, how many thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> may we afford to <HI>forget,</HI> rather than chuse to <HI>remember?</HI> Again, as there may be quick Apprehension, clear fan|cy, and firm memory without one grain of Grace; so there may be <HI>strong Gra|ces,</HI> where there are but <HI>lame Faculties.</HI>
<PB N="150" REF="80">
You may have a <HI>warm Heart,</HI> tho you have but a <HI>weak Head.</HI> The Favour of <HI>God</HI> is not determin'd by our natural parts, but is disposed according to his everlasting <HI>Covenant;</HI> according to which he will require no more than he gives. He will welcome him that improveth his <HI>Two</HI> talents to <HI>Four,</HI> with the same words as he was received, that made <HI>Ten</HI> of his <HI>Five.</HI></P>
<P>And finally, It is a Mercy that the use of your Faculties is not <HI>wholly lost;</HI> that you are able, in some measure, to expound the <HI>Book of Ecclesiastes</HI> concern|ing the <HI>Vanity</HI> of all things below, though you cannot so clearly unfold the <HI>Book of Canticles;</HI> that you are able to un|derstand and chuse the best things; that you can <HI>press</HI> others, to the things that you cannot now perform your selves.

<P>A <HI>Fourth Inconvenience</HI> incident to<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 4. Sen|ses decay|ed.</NOTE> <HI>Old-age,</HI> is the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> their Sen|ses;</HI> and especially in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ose which are called <HI>Senses of Discipline, Seeing</HI> and <HI>Hearing,</HI> by which as through windows Light is derived into the Soul. For as in <HI>Natural</HI> things nothing is found in the <HI>Understanding,</HI> which was not be|fore in the <HI>senses;</HI> so in <HI>Spiritual</HI> things, the <HI>Mysteries</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> are not <HI>invent|ed</HI> by our <HI>Minds,</HI> but conveyed to us by the <HI>sacred Oracles.</HI> And therefore it is very probable that <HI>Satan</HI> beareth a particular spite to these, as <HI>some</HI> have observed from the <HI>Persons</HI> possest by him, whom he so frequently struck <HI>deaf,</HI> and <HI>dumb,</HI> and <HI>blind.</HI> But it is evident, that as by these <HI>Doors</HI> sin en|tred into the Soul, so we find our <HI>De|cayes</HI> sooner in them, than in our <HI>other Senses.</HI> The <HI>Eye</HI> it grows dim, and the <HI>Ear</HI> it grows dull, and both grow worse
<PB N="152" REF="81">
and worse, and that without hopes of Cure. This was the case of the <HI>Patri|arch Isaac,</HI> Gen. 27. 1. <HI>And it came to pass,</HI> that <HI>when Isaac was old and his Eyes were dim, so that he could not see,</HI> &amp;c. whereupon using his Hands for Eyes, he was mistaken in his own Sons. In|deed the <HI>Degrees</HI> of these Decayes are <HI>different,</HI> in some less, in some greater: but as in <HI>Houses</HI> the <HI>Windows</HI> suffer first and most; so in our <HI>houses of Clay,</HI> the Organs of <HI>sight</HI> and <HI>hearing,</HI> do more or less, wax out of tune, before the <HI>Fabrick</HI> fall.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Decayes</HI> of the <HI>Eye</HI> and <HI>Ear</HI> are grievous <HI>Afflictions;</HI> when one can scarce discern one thing, or person, or one letter from another; to continue in a perpetual night or twilight, how un|comfortable must it be? Or, to see peo|ple speak, and yet scarce to hear what they say, it is next to being buried alive. For man is a <HI>sociable</HI> creature; and the <HI>All-wise God</HI> saw that it was <HI>not good for Adam</HI> himself, <HI>to be alone:</HI> but the <HI>Privation</HI> of these senses leaves a man to <HI>himself alone.</HI> He <HI>sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath born it upon him.</HI> He is liable to be abused and in|jured both in word and deed, and is
<PB N="153" REF="81" MS="y">
uncapable to help himself. He is also rendred useless; hereupon <HI>T. Manlius Torquatus</HI> excused himself from the <HI>Con|sulship,</HI> saying it was not fit he should be intrusted with the Lives and For|tunes of others, that could not see or hear, but with others eyes and ears: yea, which is worst of all, such persons are precluded from the <HI>Means of Grace</HI> and <HI>Salvation.</HI> There is no better com|pany sometimes than a good <HI>Book,</HI> but they cannot see a <HI>letter.</HI> And then <HI>Faith</HI> comes by Hearing, and it is preserved, and increased by the same means; but let them press never so near, they can scarce hear a distinct word, much less a whole sentence: and what a dry and dead Soul must that be, that lives out of the road of these ordinary helps?</P>
<P>It is some <HI>Question</HI> whether of these losses is the <HI>greater,</HI> of the <HI>Eye-sight</HI> or of the <HI>Hearing.</HI> And upon some accounts the <HI>latter</HI> seems to be the sadder loss of the <HI>two;</HI> partly because <HI>God</HI> hath ordain|ed <HI>Hearing,</HI> to be the ordinary Means of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Comfort:</HI> partly because there are no such, at least no such ready and commodious <HI>Helps</HI> yet found out, for the <HI>Dulness</HI> of the <HI>Ear,</HI> as there are for the <HI>Dimness</HI> of the <HI>Eye.</HI> However,
<PB N="154" REF="82">
the Decayes of either of them, especially of Both these <HI>senses,</HI> are a great <HI>Disad|vantage,</HI> and a heavy burden upon <HI>Old|age.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding all this allegation, <HI>Old-age</HI> is not altogether so miserable as it is painted. For there are many <HI>Aged</HI> People, of whom it may be said, as it was of <HI>Moses, Deut.</HI> 34. 7. <HI>his Eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated:</HI> So it pleaseth the <HI>Lord</HI> to continue to ma|ny <HI>Aged</HI> persons<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Constant Visus &amp; Auditus, nec quic|quam in iis imminu|tum expe|rior. <HI>Guil. River.</HI> aeta|tis 70.</NOTE>, very great vivacity in both those Senses, the greater cause they have to be thankfull for the same. But though it must not be denyed, that for the most part <HI>Old-age</HI> is <HI>dim of sight</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nec dum caligant oculi eo usque ut perspicillis opus sit. <HI>And. Ri|vet.</HI> aetat. 78.</NOTE> and <HI>dull of hearing;</HI> yet 'tis as true, that even these decayes are incident to <HI>younger</HI> persons. How many young peo|ple may we meet with, that are <HI>de|fective</HI> in one or other of them? Some that are <HI>purblind,</HI> others <HI>dim-sighted,</HI> some from their <HI>birth,</HI> some by casual <HI>acci|dents,</HI> some by <HI>distempers:</HI> nay, it is one of the wonders of Gods <HI>Providence,</HI> that considering the folly and rashness of <HI>Chil|dren,</HI> any of us carry our <HI>Eyes</HI> untouched unto <HI>elder</HI> years: so that neither is this af|fliction to be confined to <HI>Old-age.</HI> Yea, if we grant that these <HI>Defects</HI> should
<PB N="155" REF="82">
unavoydably befall <HI>Old</HI> people, yet they do not alwayes make them <HI>useless,</HI> and then all's well enough. Even <HI>Blind</HI> and <HI>Deaf</HI> persons have bin more serviceable in their places, than multitudes of some people, that have their <HI>eyes</HI> and <HI>ears. Tully</HI> tells of divers, that were wholly dark, yet Ornaments to their <HI>Countrey.</HI> In particular, he relates of <HI>Appius,</HI> that was <HI>old</HI> and <HI>blind,</HI> yet retaining his Au|thority, he governed a great Family with that dexterity, that his Children feared him, his Neighbours respected him; and when a dishonourable Peace was likely to be made with <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> he caused himself to be carryed in his Chair to the <HI>Senate,</HI> and there did ef|fectually interpose to hinder it.</P>
<P>But that which should chiefly support a wise and good man under these <HI>De|cayes</HI> of the <HI>Senses,</HI> is, The comfortable <HI>review</HI> of the <HI>right use</HI> he hath made of them, that he hath not us'd them as <HI>Instruments of unrighteousness unto Sin,</HI> but as the <HI>Instruments of righteousness un|to God;</HI> or an hearty <HI>Grief</HI> for his <HI>Abuse</HI> of them: And the joyful <HI>Prospect</HI> of the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> when all our Imper|fections will be done away, and <HI>our vile bodies made like Christs glorious body.</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="83">
There's no body much grieved at the want of repair in a <HI>House</HI> which he is <HI>leaving,</HI> when he is ready to go to one that will need <HI>reparation</HI> no more. Yea, there is cause of <HI>Thankfulness,</HI> that we have enjoyed the use of these <HI>Senses so long,</HI> whereas we might have bin born <HI>blind,</HI> and <HI>deaf,</HI> and <HI>dumb:</HI> but especially, that God hath given us a <HI>spiritual Eye,</HI> and an <HI>inward Ear.</HI> <Q>Let that Soul ex|ceedingly rejoyce, said <HI>Basil,</HI> that hath an Eye to discern invisible things, even to behold him with whom it shall dwell for ever.</Q> And thus <HI>Antony</HI> the <HI>Her|mite</HI> comforted <HI>Didymus.</HI> <Q>You should not, saith he, take it <HI>heavily,</HI> that you want such <HI>Eyes</HI> as <HI>Mice</HI> and other brute <HI>Animals</HI> enjoy, but rather reckon your self a <HI>blessed</HI> man, in having such <HI>eyes</HI> as <HI>Angels</HI> have, whereby you may <HI>behold God himself</HI> .</Q><NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Sozom.</HI> lib. 3. c. 14. <HI>Hieron.</HI> ep. ad Abiga|um.</NOTE></P>
<P>And through the <HI>Goodness of God</HI> it often falls out, that these outward <HI>De|fects</HI> are more than compensated with greater measures of <HI>Understanding</HI> and of <HI>Memory.</HI> He may well be contented to lose an <HI>Eye</HI> or <HI>Ear,</HI> which must pe|rish at last, that in lieu thereof receives a greater portion of <HI>Faith, Love, Wis|dom</HI> and <HI>Patience,</HI> and so becomes the
<PB N="157" REF="83" MS="y">
better man, and the better Christian.</P>
<P>It is also some <HI>alleviation</HI> of this <HI>Af|fliction,</HI> to consider that all these <HI>Visible</HI> things are but <HI>Vanity,</HI> yea <HI>vanity of va|nities.</HI> That the <HI>Eye is not satisfied with seeing,</HI> nor <HI>the Ear filled with hearing, Eccles.</HI> 1. 2. 8. And that whose wants his <HI>Sight</HI> or <HI>Hearing,</HI> escapes many a <HI>Temptation,</HI> which do frequently surprize the Soul through those Windows: and that, as at other times, so especially in the <HI>Service of God.</HI> How often doth the <HI>Heart walk after the Eyes,</HI> and so steal away from <HI>God?</HI> How apt is every <HI>noise,</HI> to disorder the Soul? so that as we are deprived of the <HI>comfort</HI> of these Senses, so we are freed from the <HI>snares</HI> that attend them. And the <HI>Answer</HI> is not to be forgotten which <HI>Maris</HI> the <HI>Godly Bishop of Chalcedon</HI> gave to <HI>Iulian the Apostate,</HI> who upbraided him, that his <HI>God</HI> had not cured him of his <HI>Blind|ness;</HI> which was, That he praised his <HI>God</HI> with all his heart for his Blindness, whereby he was kept from seeing such an ungracious face, as his was.</P>
<P>And <HI>lastly,</HI> let us that feel these <HI>De|cayes,</HI> greatly magnify the <HI>Lord,</HI> who hath directed us to the use of <HI>Glasses</HI> and <HI>Spectacles,</HI> whereby we have in a

manner new <HI>Eyes</HI> put into our Heads, and are inabled to read, and write, and work, even to the very <HI>Sun-set</HI> of our Lives.

man away. So that an <HI>Aged</HI> person is<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senectus incurabilis morbus.</NOTE> a very <HI>Hospital,</HI> and <HI>Old-age</HI> is it self an incurable <HI>Disease,</HI> and any other added to it makes the case desperate. Some of them indeed speed better than others, but usually if they escape <HI>Acute</HI> diseases, some <HI>Chronical</HI> distemper attends them to their Graves.</P>
<P>Now this is a very <HI>sensible Inconve|nience:</HI> None of these afflictions <HI>are joy|ous, but grievous</HI> with a witness. They vex and torment the <HI>Body,</HI> that a man hath no <HI>mind</HI> to <HI>live,</HI> and yet no <HI>power</HI> to <HI>dye.</HI> Hear <HI>Iob,</HI> c. 7. 20. <HI>I am a bur|den to my self.</HI> Job 10. 1. <HI>My soul is wea|ry of my life.</HI> The Old person cries out with him, <HI>Iob</HI> 16. 12. <HI>I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder, he hath taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces;&mdash;he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare, he poureth out my gall upon the ground.

<P>But yet this <HI>Burden</HI> is not to be ap|propriated to <HI>Old-age,</HI> as if they and they only were the subject of distempers and of pain.

<P>Neither are <HI>all Aged</HI> people so laden with these <HI>pains and distempers;</HI> many of them having a very convenient mea|sure of health to their lives end.

the <HI>first</HI> chapter, made nothing of walk|ing <HI>twenty</HI> miles to dine with a <HI>Relati|on,</HI> when he was above an <HI>hundred</HI> years old.

<P>The best <HI>Supports</HI> however for the <HI>Aged</HI> under their <HI>Maladies,</HI> are a <HI>deep Study</HI> on the <HI>Wisdom, Power, Goodness,</HI> and <HI>Promises</HI> of God.

For by our <HI>Distempers</HI> the <HI>Lord</HI> is pleased to shew us more effectually the <HI>frailty</HI> of our Condition, the <HI>Evil of sin,</HI> the <HI>Vanity</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> and many other <HI>Lessons</HI> that are not commonly learn'd other|wise. It's plain, that these are fair <HI>warn|ings</HI> to us to provide a <HI>better house</HI> for the <HI>Soul,</HI> that will endure. In this <HI>Disease,</HI> said <HI>Old Olevian,</HI> I have learn|ed to know aright what <HI>sin</HI> is, and what the <HI>Majesty</HI> of <HI>God</HI> is.

are found there? These are the <HI>tributes</HI> of Life, which if a man know how to bear patiently, his <HI>Soul</HI> will be better|ed, and his <HI>Vertues</HI> adorned.

<P>A <HI>Sixth Inconvenience</HI> in <HI>Old-age,</HI> is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 6. Bro|ken with Crosses.</NOTE> <HI>that it is broken with Crosses and outward Troubles.</HI> These, though they meet us in <HI>every</HI> stage of our life, yet a whole <HI>troop</HI> of them commonly fall upon us in <HI>Old-age.</HI> Then doth <HI>Po|verty</HI> often come as <HI>an armed man:</HI> His <HI>getting</HI> dayes are gone, now his <HI>spend|ing</HI> time is come: And if he have need of <HI>much,</HI> and yet hath <HI>little</HI> in store, he seems to be in a miserable Condition.
<PB N="165" REF="87">
The <HI>Cynick Philosopher,</HI> when he was asked, what was the most calamitous Creature in the world, confidently an|swered, <HI>It was an indigent Old person.</HI> Likewise every body is ready to injure and run down the <HI>Aged,</HI> reckoning that they are least able to defend themselves. For as to the weakest part of the body, there is a confluence of all <HI>humours,</HI> which settle there, so very often it falls out, that a combination of troubles seize upon <HI>Aged</HI> people, <HI>Ioh.</HI> 21. 18. <HI>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, when thou wast young thou gird|edst thy self, and walkedst whither thou wouldst: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldst not.</HI></P>
<P>And of these Troubles, the <HI>sharpest</HI> are from their <HI>Relations;</HI> the <HI>Disobedi|ence</HI> of some, or the <HI>Death</HI> of others. How doth the pride, prodigality or wil|fulness of <HI>Children</HI> or <HI>Grand-children</HI> pro|voke, and grieve the hoary head! And how many <HI>Aged</HI> persons see husband, wife, children, and other dear Friends, and Relations posted to the grave be|fore them, which do each of them, as it were, tear away a piece of him, and leave him as <HI>a sparrow alone upon the</HI>
<PB N="166" REF="88">
<HI>house-top?</HI> In short, <HI>Old-age</HI> is recorded as the <HI>Sink</HI> of mans life, into which run all the miseries incident to humane nature.</P>
<P>And that which makes this <HI>Burden</HI> more grievous, is, That these seize up|on the persons when their <HI>strength</HI> is <HI>spent,</HI> their <HI>spirits low,</HI> and their bodily <HI>infirmities many.</HI> They are within sight of the shore, and yet in danger to be sunk and wrack'd, with the storms which beat upon them. When they had thought all their troubles had been blown over, it frets them sore to meet them again. And especially, if they have had <HI>plenty</HI> and <HI>prosperity</HI> in the course of their lives, their <HI>straits, losses</HI> and <HI>troubles,</HI> now ag|gravate their affliction.</P>
<P>Now to Mitigate these Pressures we must know, 1. That these <HI>Crosses</HI> are <HI>common</HI> to all. As they do not infalli|bly attend <HI>all Aged</HI> persons, for many have fair weather all their journey long; so they befall <HI>all mankind</HI> indifferently in every part of life. If these be <HI>Miseries,</HI> there's no mortal man without his Mi|sery. We are in this World, as <HI>Israel</HI> was in the <HI>Wilderness,</HI> who had no <HI>day</HI> without a <HI>Cloud,</HI> but then they had no <HI>night</HI> without a <HI>glympse of light.</HI> Where
<PB N="167" REF="88">
dwells the man, or of what Cloth is his coat made, who hath not met with <HI>straits,</HI> and with <HI>vexations?</HI> that hath not buried many of his <HI>Relations</HI> and <HI>Friends?</HI> so that we must quarrel with every age, as well as <HI>Old-age,</HI> yea with the <HI>Providence of God</HI> by this argu|ment.</P>
<P>2. These <HI>Crosses</HI> and <HI>Losses</HI> are abso|lutely <HI>Hurtful to none.</HI> They are not properly and intirely <HI>Evils. Criminal</HI> evils are <HI>real</HI> Evils, <HI>poenal</HI> Evils are not so. These <HI>fluunt a summo bono,</HI> are in|flicted by <HI>Him</HI> that is eminently <HI>Good; ducunt ad summum bonum,</HI> they guide and help us towards the greatest <HI>Good; erant in summo Bono,</HI> they were upon <HI>him</HI> who was intirely <HI>Good. Prosperi|ty</HI> hath, but <HI>Adversity</HI> hath never hurt a good man. Yea some of the <HI>Hea|thens</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Nihil infe|licius mihi eo videtur, cui nihil un|quam evenit adversi. <HI>Se|neca.</HI></NOTE> have been bold to judge those men <HI>miserable,</HI> that have never met with <HI>any</HI> troubles. They are our <HI>Physick,</HI> which may <HI>disturb</HI> us; but <HI>Sin</HI> is our <HI>Poyson,</HI> which will <HI>destroy</HI> us. The <HI>bit|terest Physick</HI> is better than the <HI>sweetest Poyson.</HI></P>
<P>3. They are <HI>Useful</HI> to those that are <HI>good.</HI> Though they be briars, thorns and thistles in themselves, yet by the
<PB N="168" REF="89" MS="y">
blessing of <HI>God,</HI> they prove <HI>sweet-bryars</HI> and <HI>holy-thistles</HI> to holy men. How ma|ny things do we count Evil, that are most wholsom for us? They Exercise our <HI>Faith,</HI> our <HI>Wisdom,</HI> our <HI>Patience,</HI> and the tryal of these is more precious than <HI>of fine gold.</HI> They teach us, as was said of <HI>Diseases,</HI> many lessons more effectually, than the <HI>Word</HI> it self with|out them can do. The <HI>Chyrurgeon</HI> and the <HI>Executioner</HI> do both <HI>bind</HI> men, but to different Ends; the one doth it to <HI>be|reave</HI> of life, the other to <HI>preserve</HI> it<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Chamier.</NOTE>.

<P>4.

<PB N="169" REF="89" MS="y">
may the better receive <HI>evil.</HI> As <HI>Cato</HI> in <HI>Tully</HI> answers <HI>Caecilius,</HI> who objected this against <HI>Old-age,</HI> that living long a man sees many displeasing and <HI>uncom|fortable</HI> events; Yea, said he, and per|haps many <HI>comfortable</HI> things also<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Quod diu vivendo multa quae non vult vi|det: R.

But the true and only <HI>Remedy</HI> against this <HI>Inconvenience,</HI> is <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Patience;</HI> which the wise <HI>God</HI> hath largely pre|scribed in the <HI>11th. and 12th. Chapters of the Hebrews.</HI> By these a sound <HI>Chri|stian</HI> shall not only <HI>bear</HI> these Onsets, but <HI>overcome</HI> them, and adorn the hoary head with <HI>trophies.</HI> We cannot, saith a <HI>Foreigner</HI> to <HI>Christianity,</HI> change the course of things, but we can take a good heart, a masculine spirit, to bear <HI>sad accidents</HI> with <HI>substantial courage,</HI> and to be re|conciled to <HI>Providence</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Quo for|titer fortui|ta patiamur &amp; naturae consentia|mus. <HI>Senec.</HI></NOTE>. And present|ly again, It is our best way to abide what we cannot amend, and to attend <HI>God</HI> without murmuring, from whom all ailments come; for it is an ill Sol|dier that follows his <HI>Commander</HI> grumb|ling<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Optimum est pati, quod emendare non possis; &amp; Deum, quo auctore cun|cta proveni|unt sine mur|muratione comitari: malus miles est, qui Impe|ratorem ge|mens sequi|tur. <HI>Sen.</HI></NOTE>. But we have a more sure <HI>word of prophecy,</HI> Rom. 8. 28. <HI>All things,</HI> mark it, <HI>all things work together for good to them that love God, that are called ac|cording to his purpose:</HI> Which blessed <HI>word,</HI> if it be understood, believed and
<PB N="170" REF="90" MS="y">
considered; and our love to God and effectual calling evinced, is alone able, <HI>Gods spirit</HI> accompanying it, to settle, quiet, and comfort our hearts under all troubles whatsoever.</P>
<P>Let it therefore be the chief care of all <HI>Aged</HI> Persons to <HI>make their calling and election sure,</HI> to strengthen their Faith in <HI>God,</HI> and by their hope to travel into the other World; for then only will our <HI>afflictions</HI> feel <HI>light, while we look not at things seen, but at things unseen.</HI> The thoughts of the grave will mortifie us to <HI>things seen,</HI> and the thoughts of the Countrey beyond the grave will rea|lize the <HI>unseen World,</HI> and then our troubles will be easie, and our crosses blessings. The sight of the approaching shore, will make an <HI>Aged</HI> Person bear the present storms with chearfulness, knowing that he shall shortly be well, either <HI>under Heaven,</HI> or <HI>in Heaven: None of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my self, so that I may finish my course with joy,</HI> Act. 20. 24.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Seventh Inconvenience</HI> that is<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 7. At|tended with Con|tempt.</NOTE> charged on <HI>Old-age</HI> is, <HI>That it is attended with Contempt.</HI> Old People com|monly are <HI>despis'd,</HI> especially when they are not supported with <HI>good Estates.</HI> Most People avoid them, and treat them as <HI>superfluous Creatures.</HI> For the gene|rality of men do value others not for their <HI>Wisdom,</HI> or <HI>real Vertue,</HI> but either for some <HI>likeness</HI> of disposition, or some <HI>usefulness.</HI> Now the <HI>Ancient</HI> are not, by the <HI>disparity</HI> of their years, so <HI>com|plaisant,</HI> nor by their <HI>disability</HI> so <HI>help|ful</HI> as heretofore; and thereupon they are <HI>contemned</HI> by younger people: Espe|cially also when they are grown <HI>de|crepit,</HI> and confin'd to their chairs or chambers; then are they an eye-sore to their <HI>successors,</HI> who secretly wish them well in Heaven, or any where out of their way upon Earth. It is too evident, how unpleasing their groans, their coughing, and their other weak|nesses are. They that can brook the <HI>peevishness,</HI> and the <HI>uncleanliness</HI> of their
<PB N="172" REF="91">
<HI>Children,</HI> cannot bear with it in their <HI>Parents:</HI> All their former <HI>parts</HI> and <HI>pains</HI> are forgotten, and they are be|held, as last years <HI>Almanacks,</HI> wholly out of date.</P>
<P>Now this is a sore <HI>Affliction,</HI> and touch|es man or woman to the quick. For such as have been regarded and reve|renced, to be neglected and despised, grates even the most ingenuous spirits. <HI>Iob</HI> 29. 30. <HI>Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel: but now they that are younger than I, have me in derision; they abhor me, they flee from me,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Miserrimum est fuisse felicem.</HI> The <HI>respects</HI> and <HI>honour</HI> that one hath <HI>formerly</HI> had, makes his <HI>present contempt</HI> more intolerable. Not but that a good man is <HI>satisfied with himself;</HI> but he is aware, that hereby he is rendred <HI>unuse|ful</HI> to others: For when the <HI>Person</HI> is despised, his <HI>Example</HI> nor his <HI>Counsel,</HI> let them be never so profitable, will be regardable or useful: He passes for an old <HI>Dotard,</HI> and there's an end. The truth is, every man would be <HI>beloved,</HI> and in some sort <HI>esteemed,</HI> but when on the contrary, he perceives that he is <HI>nothing set by,</HI> what should he do in this world? That man is a burden to
<PB N="173" REF="91">
<HI>himself,</HI> who discerns that he is a bur|den to <HI>every body else.</HI></P>
<P>But yet as we have observed in <HI>other Cases,</HI> This <HI>Inconvenience</HI> is not <HI>peculiar</HI> to <HI>Old-age,</HI> as if they <HI>only</HI> were despi|sed, or set at nought: For they that will contemn them, will set light by any other sober and wise Person also, yea they will contemn <HI>God himself.</HI> Plain is the connexion, <HI>Levit.</HI> 19. 32. <HI>Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the Lord.</HI> They that will despise an <HI>Ancient</HI> Person upon that score, will despise the <HI>Ancient of dayes</HI> himself; so that they are not alone under this <HI>Inconvenience.</HI> Neither is this <HI>Contempt universal;</HI> some young persons have that <HI>Wisdom,</HI> which teacheth them to value, and respect their <HI>Elders.</HI> Thus <HI>Tully</HI> again brings in <HI>Cato</HI> answering <HI>Caecilius,</HI> who had said, that there was nothing more miserable in <HI>Old-age,</HI> than to find themselves <HI>odious</HI> to others; nay, sayes <HI>Gato,</HI> I believe such <HI>Old</HI> men as we, are very acceptable to such young men as you, <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Lelius:</HI> And so goes on, shewing that look as <HI>Old men</HI> take pleasure in vertuous young men, though far inferiour to them, in age and wis|dom;
<PB N="174" REF="92">
so all <HI>Iudicious</HI> young men take delight, and yield great respect to grave and <HI>Ancient</HI> men: And thus <HI>Plato</HI> brings in <HI>Socrates</HI> saying, I love to hear the Discourses of <HI>Old</HI> men, seeing they have already traced the way that I must go. And most commonly those <HI>Ancient</HI> Peo|ple meet with most <HI>Contempt,</HI> who by their <HI>Frowardness</HI> or otherwise do lessen themselves, and alienate the respects of others from them; or such as have <HI>liv|ed</HI> meerly to <HI>themselves,</HI> without regard to the good of others: Or else&punc; perhaps to <HI>repay</HI> into their own bosoms that <HI>neg|lect</HI> and <HI>contempt,</HI> which they heretofore have been guilty of, either to their <HI>Pa|rents,</HI> or other <HI>Seniors.</HI></P>
<P>But however it be, this <HI>Inconvenience</HI> is not the fault of <HI>Old-age,</HI> but rather of such <HI>undutiful Relations,</HI> who have forgotten the <HI>Law of Nature;</HI> or of such <HI>inconsiderate</HI> people, as never foresee that the case will e're long be their own; and they must look for the same mea|sure, which they have meted to others, to be repaid into their bosoms. The <HI>Infirmities</HI> of <HI>Old</HI> People should rather breed <HI>Pity,</HI> than <HI>Contempt:</HI> Inasmuch as though, by reason of their <HI>Age,</HI> they are become <HI>twice Children,</HI> yet even <HI>their</HI>
<PB N="175" REF="92" MS="y">
<HI>Angels behold the face of their heavenly Father.</HI> And though, by reason of their <HI>impotence</HI> or <HI>poverty,</HI> they cannot vindi|cate their just <HI>Authority,</HI> or <HI>punish</HI> their Contemners; yet <HI>God</HI> will certainly take their parts, and revenge their wrongs.</P>
<P>In the mean time they must <HI>comfort</HI> themselves in the <HI>Favour</HI> and <HI>Protecti|on</HI> of the <HI>most High,</HI> in the <HI>Promises</HI> which he hath made, in the <HI>Iudgment</HI> and <HI>esteem</HI> which he hath of them, in the <HI>Integrity</HI> of their <HI>hearts,</HI> in the for|mer <HI>Usefulness</HI> of their <HI>Lives</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Beatus ju|venis qui be|n&egrave; vivit, sed magis bea|tus est senex qui ben&egrave; vixit: quod enim juvenis sperat, adep|tus est se|nex. <HI>Ambr.</HI> de Iacob. &amp; vit. be|at. c. 8.</NOTE>, and in the <HI>Hopes</HI> they have to be shortly out of the reach either of <HI>envy</HI> or <HI>contempt.</HI> What matter is it for the esteem of a company of <HI>worms,</HI> when a man is well accounted of among the <HI>Angels?</HI> how easily may he want the <HI>respects</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> that enjoys the <HI>smiles</HI> of <HI>God?</HI> Alas we are but <HI>strangers</HI> in this world, and there|fore must not grudge to be <HI>strangely used;</HI> he greatly forgets himself, and the coun|trey to which he is travelling, that is much concern'd either with the <HI>Admi|ration,</HI> or <HI>Contempt</HI> of foolish men.</P>
<P>Yet it should be the Care of all <HI>Anci|ent</HI> people, to use all good <HI>Means</HI> to <HI>prevent,</HI> as much as may be, this <HI>In|convenience;</HI> to wit, to watch against

all <HI>Peevishness, Covetousness, Envy,</HI> and all the other aforesaid <HI>Vices</HI> of <HI>Old-age:</HI> For there is nothing doth so much <HI>vilifie,</HI> yea <HI>nullifie</HI> a person as <HI>sin.</HI> And then to study and practise <HI>Wisdom, Pa|tience</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> and those other <HI>Gra|ces</HI> before specified: For there is no|thing doth so much command <HI>Regard</HI> as the <HI>Image of God.</HI> Sincere Piety will procure respect, more than birth or riches; and you have seldom seen <HI>Old</HI> People despised but for some real or supposed failings. <HI>Particular instances</HI> do never invalidate, but establish <HI>general</HI> Rules; and that is, <HI>Them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me, shall be lightly esteemed,</HI> 1 Sam. 2. 30.</P>

<PB N="177" REF="93">
alas! what <HI>Service</HI> can such a one do for the <HI>Church!</HI> how little for the <HI>Com|mon-wealth!</HI> how little for their own <HI>Family?</HI> Hence the <HI>Levites, Numb.</HI> 8. at <HI>Fifty</HI> were discharged from the sub|stance of their work. Hence the <HI>Soldi|er</HI> at <HI>Sixty</HI> was <HI>Miles emeritus.</HI> For how should the <HI>Head, Heart</HI> or <HI>Hand</HI> be serviceable, that are shatter'd with breach upon breach? His useful dayes are done: He must now be <HI>labouring for Life,</HI> who before <HI>liv'd for Labour.</HI> They see things out of order in the places where they live, but they can|not amend them. He that formerly could have <HI>Studied many hours,</HI> is spent now with a <HI>few minutes;</HI> and those that have served at the <HI>altar,</HI> are now glad to sit by the <HI>fire.</HI> Hence the old <HI>Ro|man Proverb</HI> beforementioned, <HI>Sexage|narios de ponte dejiciendos,</HI> that is, Let those that are <HI>sixty</HI> years old be turn'd off the <HI>bridge:</HI> Their work is done, they live to no purpose.</P>
<P>Now this is a heavy <HI>Trouble</HI> to a <HI>Good</HI> man, yea to any <HI>Ingenuous</HI> man. Such do know, that <HI>Usefulness</HI> is the <HI>End,</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> of Life: Take that away, and what is Life good for? A man is thenceforth but a <HI>Cypher,</HI> yea
<PB N="178" REF="94">
and worse; for he eats, and drinks, and troubles the world, and no way helps the Inhabitants of it. Hereupon in a <HI>certain Countrey,</HI> its said, that the <HI>Old</HI> people, when they found themselves <HI>decrepit,</HI> went into an adjacent <HI>Climate,</HI> where by the quality of the <HI>Air</HI> they were soon extinguished: Which Reme|dy is not to be liked, though their sense of <HI>unserviceableness</HI> is to be remarked. For <HI>Plato</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Plato.</NOTE> could say, The more <HI>benefi|cial</HI> we can be to <HI>mankind,</HI> the <HI>liker</HI> we are to <HI>God.</HI> To become therefore disabled from Service, is <HI>Death</HI> to an active use|ful spirit. Besides, as <HI>Imployment</HI> makes <HI>improvement,</HI> so on the other side <HI>Rest</HI> breeds <HI>Rust,</HI> and they that leave off the <HI>Acts,</HI> lose the <HI>Habits,</HI> and become more empty and insignificant, than ever they were before. Upon all which accounts this <HI>Disability</HI> is a most disconsolate <HI>Af|fliction,</HI> and sufficient of it self to sink their weak spirits with despair.</P>
<P>But as we have observed in <HI>other</HI> Cases, this <HI>Grievance</HI> is not <HI>peculiar</HI> to <HI>Old-age.</HI> But people of all Ages have divers ways become unable to serve their generation. Some by the <HI>hand of God,</HI> inflicting such <HI>Distempers</HI> on their <HI>Minds</HI> or <HI>Bodies,</HI> as have made them useless in
<PB N="179" REF="94">
their places. Some by the <HI>Procurement</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> by whom many in the prime of their time have been laid aside; sometimes <HI>justly,</HI> sometimes <HI>unjustly,</HI> and all opportunity taken from them of do|ing good in the World. Neither are all <HI>Aged</HI> persons rendred useless: For many there be of both <HI>Sexes,</HI> that per|severe in well-doing to the last. <HI>Cato</HI> pleaded causes, when he was past <HI>four|score</HI> years, and <HI>Isocrates</HI> wrote excel|lent things at <HI>fourscore</HI> and <HI>fourteen</HI> years of age. And not only the <HI>Tongues,</HI> but the <HI>Hands</HI> of very many <HI>Old</HI> people are found as nimble to <HI>good works,</HI> as of younger Persons. They that have been useful in their <HI>strength,</HI> will scarce ever become useless in their <HI>weakness. Plu|tarch</HI> observes that an industrious <HI>Bee,</HI> never degenerates into a <HI>Drone,</HI> in its <HI>Old-age.</HI> Too many there be of every Age that live only to themselves, that neither <HI>Serve God,</HI> nor <HI>observe Man,</HI> but in order to their own <HI>Interest,</HI> or <HI>Appe|tite:</HI> These are good for nothing, young or old; but they that understand, and embrace the true <HI>Ends</HI> of <HI>life,</HI> will be useful one way or other, to their lives end.</P>
<P>And the great <HI>Service</HI> that the <HI>Ancient</HI>
<PB N="180" REF="95" MS="y">

<P><PB N="183" REF="96">Now this <HI>Affliction</HI> to an holy heart is a very heavy <HI>burden.</HI> When a poor man is cut short in all his other Com|forts, and as it were besieged with all the Calamities of this life; yet while he hath this <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Gods Ordinances</HI> free and open, thereby he receives con|tinual supplies from <HI>Heaven,</HI> the <HI>streams thereof make glad the City of God:</HI> But when this is <HI>stopt,</HI> the Soul grows sad, and dry, and barren.

For when a man is harras'd with cares and troubles all the week long, yet he is relieved and refreshed in his approach unto <HI>God</HI> up|on his <HI>own Day:</HI> But with the decre|pit <HI>Old man,</HI> every day is alike, and his Soul is left destitute of spiritual supplies in an ordinary way. And this <HI>Afflicti|on</HI> is saddest of all, when by <HI>disuse</HI> of the means of Grace, the <HI>Soul</HI> grows <HI>stupid</HI> and unconcern'd in the matter; as without special <HI>Grace,</HI> we shall be apt to be: So that the misery is <HI>great</HI> in the <HI>want,</HI> and <HI>greater</HI> when <HI>insensible</HI>

of the <HI>want.</HI> No great wonder there|fore that when all these miseries meet together, a man cry out with <HI>Iob, I would not live always.</HI> So that <HI>Tiberius Caesar</HI> had a saying, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> tells us, that it was a shameful thing for a man that was past <HI>sixty,</HI> to stretch out his hand to a <HI>Physician;</HI> reckoning that it was fit he should then be content to dye.</P>
<P>But yet, if we weigh the matter well, the Case of <HI>Ancient</HI> people is not so <HI>desperate</HI> as it seems. For to proceed in our <HI>former Method,</HI> it is evident that many others besides the <HI>Aged</HI> are cut short in the <HI>means of Grace;</HI> some <HI>will|ingly</HI> in <HI>Factories</HI> beyond the Seas, some <HI>willfully</HI> by their own <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>Un|godliness,</HI> some <HI>unwillingly</HI> by <HI>Distempers</HI> and other <HI>hindrances.</HI> And on the other side, divers <HI>Ancient</HI> people have been capable to attend the Service of God even to their dying day. Thus <HI>Ahi|jah,</HI> though his <HI>Eyes were set for Age,</HI> yet was enabled to prophecy to <HI>Ierobo|am</HI>'s wife. And <HI>Iacob</HI> could <HI>worship God, leaning on the top of his Staff.</HI> And St. <HI>Iohn</HI> was an <HI>Evangelist,</HI> when he was an <HI>hundred</HI> years old. And there was <HI>Anna,</HI> a widdow of about <HI>fourscore and</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="97">
<HI>four years,</HI> yet <HI>departed not from the Tem|ple, but served God with fastings and pray|ers night and day,</HI> Luk. 2. 37. So that <HI>all Aged</HI> persons are not precluded from spiritual exercises.</P>
<P>And though they should become un|able to frequent the <HI>Publick Ordinances of God,</HI> yet they may pray, and sigh, and meditate in their <HI>chambers;</HI> and these, proceeding from a sincere and sensible Soul, are most acceptable unto <HI>God.</HI> As for the <HI>external Acts</HI> of Re|ligion, they avail nothing without <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>love,</HI> which lodge in the heart. The <HI>immanent Acts</HI> of the Soul, which are to understand, to meditate, to will, and to desire, do most perfect the same. And where the <HI>Deed</HI> cannot be done, <HI>God</HI> doth accept the <HI>will</HI> for the <HI>Deed.</HI> The weakest and poorest <HI>Old man</HI> or <HI>woman</HI> may have <HI>high</HI> meditations un|der a <HI>low</HI> roof, and a <HI>large</HI> heart with|in <HI>narrow</HI> walls.</P>
<P>No <HI>Aged</HI> person therefore should be discouraged by their <HI>Inability</HI> for <HI>Gods Service;</HI> since <HI>He knoweth their frame,</HI> he <HI>remembreth that they are but dust.</HI> The <HI>Lord</HI> hath said, <HI>When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst: I the Lord will</HI>

<P>In short, 1. <HI>All Aged</HI> People are not oppressed with the fear of Death. Too few there are that think at all of it.

<P>2. The Young have the <HI>same reason</HI> to be concern'd about <HI>Dying</HI> as the <HI>Old.</HI> For <HI>Youth</HI> hath more wayes to Death than <HI>Age</HI> hath.

No <HI>good man</HI> need be affrighted at the <HI>approach of Death.</HI> For the <HI>pow|er</HI> and <HI>sting</HI> of Death is utterly taken away by our <HI>Saviours Death,</HI> and so it can do us no hurt<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Vita Christi in|struxit no|stram; mors Christi de|struxit no|stram. <HI>Bern.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>Let it therefore be the business of each <HI>Aged</HI> person to be <HI>reconciled</HI> to <HI>Death;</HI> to be <HI>dying daily,</HI> by <HI>Mortifying</HI> your affections to all the vanities of this life, and by <HI>meditating</HI> on the life to come.

And thus I conclude this <HI>Particular,</HI> that too ma|ny <HI>Old</HI> people never fear <HI>Death,</HI> for they never spend thoughts about it; that the <HI>young</HI> have as much <HI>reason</HI> to apprehend it, as the <HI>Old;</HI> that a <HI>slavish fear</HI> of it is <HI>folly</HI> in any; and that no good man needs to be <HI>affrighted,</HI> but rather <HI>comforted</HI> with it.</P>

of <HI>Old-age,</HI> are these following.</P>
<P><HI>First, Old-age</HI> is <HI>Greater in Authority,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect; 1. It is greater in Authority.</NOTE> than any other Age. There is an <HI>Au|thory</HI> resulting from the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> as well as that which is conferr'd by <HI>Civil Laws;</HI> the <HI>former</HI> is that wherewith <HI>Old-age</HI> is invested. <HI>God</HI> himself, who is the <HI>Fountain of Honour,</HI> hath given them a <HI>Patent</HI> for it: so that their <HI>Authority</HI> hath something in it <HI>divine,</HI> and they seem to have a kind of <HI>Natural Govern|ment</HI> over others. Hereby the Sentence or <HI>Opinion</HI> of the <HI>Aged</HI> may well con|clude, as much as the <HI>Arguments</HI> of the younger; and he must have a great deal of <HI>Wisdom</HI> or of <HI>Confidence,</HI> that shall contradict what a wise <HI>Aged</HI> person hath asserted.</P>
<P>That there is a certain <HI>Authority</HI> in <HI>Old-age</HI> is plain from divers <HI>Scriptures.</HI> As, <HI>Isa.</HI> 9. 15. <HI>The Ancient, and the Ho|nourable he is the Head.</HI> Now we know that the <HI>Head</HI> is the Seat of <HI>Rule.</HI> When <HI>Moses</HI> had occasion for some <HI>Coadjutors</HI> with him in Judgment, the <HI>Lord</HI> caused <HI>Seventy of the Elders of Israel,</HI> to be set apart for that work, <HI>Num.</HI> 11. 16. And so the <HI>Iudges</HI> who constituted the <HI>San|hedrin,</HI> were made up of <HI>Seventy two Elders.</HI> Again, when the <HI>Apostle</HI> would

And as this <HI>Preeminence</HI> proceeds from the <HI>Will</HI> of the <HI>All-wise God,</HI> so it is the <HI>Sence</HI> of <HI>wise Men.</HI> The <HI>Philosopher</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><HI>Arist.</HI> po|lit. lib. 7. cap. 14.</NOTE> af|firms, that the <HI>Elder</HI> do <HI>naturally</HI> pre|cede the younger.

<P>And there is a very rational <HI>Ground</HI> for this <HI>Authority</HI> in <HI>Old-age.</HI> In that the greater <HI>Seniority</HI> any one hath in years, the nearer, even upon <HI>that</HI> ac|count, do they approach to the likeness of the <HI>Eternal God,</HI> who is called the <HI>Ancient of Days,</HI> Dan. 7. 9. whose <HI>Gar|ment</HI> is represented to be <HI>white as Snow,</HI> and <HI>the Hair of his Head like the pure Wool.</HI> Withal, it is presumed that the <HI>Aged know</HI> more, for that they have <HI>seen</HI> and <HI>heard</HI> more than the younger <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Senibus Authoritas major <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; quod plur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> n&ocirc;sse &amp; vi|disse credun|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r. <HI>Quin|til. lib. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. c c 4.</HI></NOTE>.

Now <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Knowledge</HI> do chal|lenge <HI>Authority,</HI> by a certain <HI>Natural</HI> right, because the determinations pro|ceeding thence, are ever supposed to be grounded on the <HI>soundest Maxims.</HI></P>
<P>Now this <HI>Authority</HI> is a considerable <HI>Priviledge,</HI> being as is supposed in the hand of a <HI>wise person,</HI> insomuch as it is called by <HI>Cato</HI> in <HI>Tully, Senectutis apex,</HI> the <HI>Crown of Old-age.</HI> For it derives weight unto all their Counsels, Reproofs, or Instructions.

The <HI>Old Physician</HI> can sway by his <HI>Authority</HI> more than the younger. So that <HI>Authority</HI> is a <HI>Talent,</HI> which being well imployed, doth much further our <HI>Usefulness</HI> in the World: yea, their <HI>Example</HI> is more effectual than others; for one may learn much from such an one, though he say never a word <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Multum est quod &agrave; sapiente vel tacente pro|ficias. <HI>Se|nec.</HI></NOTE>. The more <HI>Authority</HI> any man hath, the more <HI>conspicuous</HI> he is, he is like a <HI>City set on a Hill,</HI> and his way and carriage are still instructive. The <HI>dignity</HI> of the <HI>person</HI> ever adds <HI>lustre</HI> to the <HI>example.</HI> And therefore all <HI>Aged</HI> persons had need

to be circumspect in their ways, lest in|stead of leading others in the narrow way to life, they do by their <HI>Example</HI> lead them in the broad way to destru|ction.</P>
<P>It doth therefore greatly behove all those that are in years, to be <HI>Sober, Grave, Temperate,</HI> &amp;c. For the <HI>hoary Head is a Crown of glory, if it be found in the way of Righteousness,</HI> Prov. 16. 31. That which is the <HI>Crown of Glory</HI> on the <HI>hoary Head,</HI> is the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> that lodgeth in the <HI>heart.</HI> The <HI>Heathen</HI> could say, Gray hairs and wrinkles do not presently create <HI>Authority,</HI> but the <HI>former</HI> life well managed, makes the <HI>latter</HI> part justly respected <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Non cani&punc; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rugae re|pent&egrave; autho|ritatem a|ferre possunt, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">d honest&egrave; acta superi|or aetas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ru|ctus capit authoritatis extremos. <HI>Cicero.</HI></NOTE>.

For in <HI>Religion</HI> there is a <HI>Body</HI> and a <HI>Soul.</HI> The <HI>Body</HI> of it consists in the <HI>Form of Godliness;</HI> the <HI>Soul</HI> of it, is that which animates all the outward Acts, and is fitly cal|led the <HI>Power of Godliness;</HI> for that the <HI>Activity</HI> and force of any thing pro|ceeds from the <HI>Soul,</HI> or inward <HI>Principle.</HI> Now the separating this <HI>form</HI> and <HI>power</HI> of Godliness, like as that of the Soul and Body, is the <HI>death</HI> of Godliness.

These are in the <HI>midst</HI> of it, and of all its <HI>troubles,</HI> and <HI>temptations;</HI> but those have travelled through them, and are now almost past them. There are <HI>Two</HI> things in the <HI>World</HI> that make it <HI>un|easie, Sin</HI> and <HI>Suffering. Sin</HI> that makes
<PB N="227" REF="118" MS="y">
it uneasie to <HI>Good</HI> men, <HI>Suffering</HI> that makes it uneasie to <HI>All</HI> men. A good man hath contracted a deep hatred a|gainst <HI>sin,</HI> and yet he cannot be rid of it. He meets with it in every place; among the looser sort of people it swarms, he sees and hears that every day, which <HI>vexeth his righteous soul;</HI> and returning home he finds it in his <HI>own heart,</HI> and that grieves him <HI>most.</HI> He is chain'd to a <HI>body of death</HI> without any reme|dy; and the more knowledge and grace he hath, the more he <HI>hates it,</HI> and ab|horrs <HI>himself</HI> by reason of it. It meets him in every <HI>Imployment,</HI> in every <HI>Pray|er,</HI> and vexeth him at the heart. He is like a man who lives by a <HI>bad Neigh|bour,</HI> or that is yoaked to a <HI>froward Wife,</HI> that cannot live <HI>comfortably with</HI> them, and cannot live <HI>possibly without</HI> them: Hence he cries out, <HI>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this Death?</HI> Now the <HI>young</HI> person, is in the midst of these <HI>Philistines;</HI> the corruption of his Nature meeting, as is said before, with the temptations of the World, is as <HI>tinder</HI> to the <HI>sparks,</HI> too easily set on fire with lust, anger, glut|tony, and such like; wherewith he must be either in continual and sharp
<PB N="228" REF="119" MS="y">
<HI>conflict,</HI> or else miserably <HI>ruin'd.</HI> Now the <HI>Aged</HI> person hath gotten many vi|ctories in this spiritual <HI>warfare,</HI> where|by his enemies are grown <HI>weaker,</HI> and he bolder and <HI>stronger.</HI> He knows this bickering will not last long, and sees the <HI>reward</HI> of his victory, and so plea|seth himself with his Condition. This made the <HI>Apostle,</HI> when <HI>Aged,</HI> to say, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 7, 8. <HI>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith, and henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness:</HI> And is not this a Priviledge? would he accept a <HI>new lease</HI> to live over his life again? not for the whole world. <HI>Seneca</HI> could say, if some God would indulge me so far, as that I might return into my cradle again, I would earnestly refuse it: I would never yield, when I have <HI>almost</HI> run my whole <HI>race,</HI> to return quite <HI>back</HI> again <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Quod si quis Deus mihi largi|atur ut ex hac aetate repueras|cam &amp; in cunis vagi|am, vald&egrave; recusem: nec vero ve|lim, quasi decurso spa|tio, a calce ad carceres revocari. <HI>Seneca.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>And for the <HI>Sufferings</HI> in the World; man whether he be <HI>born</HI> to an <HI>Estate</HI> or not, yet is <HI>born unto troubles as the sparks flie upward.</HI> We meet them in <HI>every</HI> stage of our <HI>Life;</HI> we come into the world with <HI>Cries,</HI> and go out with <HI>groans;</HI> and a great part of the space between, is replenisht with <HI>sighs,</HI> and

repent <HI>for a time,</HI> or repent <HI>for ever;</HI> whether he will repent with <HI>hope,</HI> or repent with <HI>despair.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>Repentance</HI> may be considered, in a <HI>Double</HI> respect. 1. <HI>Initially,</HI> at the <HI>first Conversion</HI> of the Soul to God; and 2. <HI>Secondarily,</HI> at the <HI>Renewing</HI> of the <HI>acts</HI> thereof afterwards. It concerns <HI>An|cient</HI> people to be acquainted <HI>respective|ly</HI> with both. This needful message then is directed,</P>
<P>1. To such <HI>Aged</HI> persons, who are yet in the state of <HI>unrenewed Nature;</HI> who have never past through the <HI>New|birth,</HI> nor know any thing by experi|ence of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> which was the Case of <HI>Old Nicodemus,</HI> though a <HI>Master in Israel,</HI> Joh. 3. 9. Now that a <HI>Funda|mental Repentance</HI> or <HI>Conversion,</HI> call it how you will, is <HI>necessary</HI> to all that shall be saved, I should think is past dispute. For it cannot be denyed, that we come into the world in a <HI>sinful</HI> state: And it is manifest, that <HI>Baptism</HI> doth not cure the Soul of that <HI>Disease;</HI> but that all people in general have a strong <HI>propensity</HI> either to the <HI>lusts of the flesh,</HI> or <HI>to the lusts of the eyes,</HI> or to <HI>pride of life,</HI> until an inward <HI>Change</HI> be wrought in the <HI>heart;</HI> which is the
<PB N="243" REF="126">
effectual <HI>Calling</HI> of a careless Sinner, to turn to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Godliness.</HI> Now if an <HI>Aged</HI> person have been a stranger to this <HI>Grace,</HI> though perhaps he hath led a sober, industrious, just, yea a chari|table <HI>life,</HI> and also hath complied with the outward <HI>acts</HI> of <HI>devotion</HI> in use: Yet except the <HI>tree</HI> have been made good by <HI>Regeneration,</HI> it cannot have its <HI>fruit unto holiness,</HI> nor <HI>the end ever|lasting life.</HI></P>
<P>I would therefore conjure all such <HI>Unconverted Old</HI> people, to apply them|selves with all speed and seriousness to this <HI>First Repentance;</HI> to be <HI>renewed in the spirit of your minds,</HI> to make you <HI>new hearts and new spirits,</HI> or else infalli|bly you <HI>must dye.</HI> Say not with <HI>Nico|demus, How can a man be born when he is old?</HI> For the <HI>Work</HI> is <HI>possible</HI> and the <HI>Method</HI> is <HI>plain.</HI> Harder it may be for an <HI>Old man</HI> to become a <HI>New man,</HI> than for the younger; hence the <HI>Pro|verb, An old naught, will never be ought:</HI> That is rarely, or difficulty, according to the <HI>Greek</HI> saying<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>: For that the <HI>Fa|culties</HI> of the Soul are <HI>enfeebled,</HI> and the <HI>Habits</HI> of Sin <HI>strengthened</HI> by <HI>continu|ance;</HI> former guilt and negligence, makes men to doubt of future <HI>assistance</HI> or <HI>ac|ceptance.</HI>

To be <HI>born</HI> in sin is sad, but to <HI>live</HI> and <HI>dye</HI> in sin, will prove a thousand times worse. Remember that the destroying Angels began, at the <HI>An|cient men before the house,</HI> Ezek. 9. 6.</P>
<P>Its true, <HI>late Repentance</HI> is <HI>seldom true,</HI> but yet <HI>true Repentance</HI> is <HI>never too late.</HI> O then lay all business aside, and set your selves about the <HI>New creature. Now or never, now and ever.</HI> If you turn the deaf ear unto God now, beware lest he deny you either the <HI>space,</HI> or the <HI>grace</HI> to repent hereafter; lest he answer you, <HI>Ubi consumpsisti farinam,</HI> &amp;c. where thou hast spent the <HI>flour</HI> of thy life, there be|stow the <HI>bran</HI> of it.

<P>And in case you find your selves at a loss in this affair, repair to some Able and faithful <HI>Minister</HI> of Christ, and be not afraid or asham'd to lay open your Condition, and follow his guidance there|in.

<P>But besides these, <HI>Repentance</HI> in the renewed <HI>Acts</HI> thereof, is a proper and necessary work for <HI>All Old</HI> people what|soever.

Study the <HI>Ten Commandments</HI> in their true <HI>extent;</HI> they are called <HI>Ten words,</HI> but they command <HI>ten thousand Duties,</HI> and forbid <HI>ten thousand Sins,</HI> ma|ny whereof you have <HI>ten thousand times</HI> failed in, and in divers of them with great <HI>aggravations:</HI> and then sit down and cry out, <HI>O that my head were a foun|tain, and mine Eyes rivers of tears,</HI> to bewail these offences against a gracious God<NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">In quan|tum non pe|perceris ti|bi, in tan|tum Deus, crede, par|cet. <HI>Ter|tul.</HI> de poen. <HI>c. 9.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>That such <HI>Assurance hath been attained,</HI> is clear enough from the Instances of <HI>Iob</HI> 19. 25, 26. of <HI>David, Psal.</HI> 16. 9, 10. of <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 7, 8. and <HI>many</HI> others.

<P>For you cannot deny but that you have <HI>Souls,</HI> immortal Souls, which be|ing <HI>Spirits</HI> cannnot dye, but must return to <HI>God</HI> that gave them: and are these Souls of so small value to be left to a <HI>Ha|zard,</HI> to an <HI>everlasting</HI> venture? And it

And therefore the <HI>Egyptian Hieroglyphick</HI> of an <HI>Aged</HI> person was a <HI>Swan,</HI> whom they imagined to dye Singing: for there is no Musick so
<PB N="260" REF="135" MS="y">
sweet in the Ears of God, as hearty <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Praises.</HI></P>
<P>And if you find your selves unable to hold out in the more <HI>stated</HI> and <HI>so|lemn Prayers,</HI> you should be more fre|quent and fervent in <HI>shorter Addresses;</HI> for it is not the <HI>length,</HI> but the <HI>strength</HI> of a Prayer that carries it with <HI>God.</HI> And in case of the want of <HI>Ability,</HI> or <HI>Opportunity</HI> for this frequency, for every poor crazy <HI>Old</HI> Man or Woman hath them not, you may and should abound in holy <HI>Ejaculations,</HI> or short <HI>Elevations</HI> of the Soul to God; sometimes by way of <HI>Confession,</HI> sometimes by way of <HI>Ad|miration,</HI> sometimes by way of <HI>Petition,</HI> and sometimes by way of <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> of all which there are various <HI>Instances</HI> in <HI>Scripture.</HI> And these you may dart upward, as you sit by the <HI>fire,</HI> as you lie in your <HI>beds,</HI> as you put <HI>on</HI> and <HI>off</HI> your cloaths. Thus ye may <HI>pray with|out ceasing,</HI> as it is, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5. 17. And the <HI>Lord</HI> will accept of these, coming from a sincere and holy heart, and which in its present circumstances can do no better. But still Prayer is the proper Province of the <HI>Aged</HI> person, and both you and your Pictures will look best, when they are (as <HI>Paul the</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="135" MS="y">

<P>For as was noted before, your la|bouring and travelling dayes are done, your <HI>Hands</HI> and <HI>Feet</HI> have done their work: the best service you can now do is upon your <HI>knees.</HI> There you may do <HI>much,</HI> therein you may ingage Him who can do <HI>All:</HI> nothing can stand before the <HI>prayer of Faith.</HI> And therefore, when you reflect upon the slips and falls in the course of your Life, so that your hearts begin to ake and faint for fear, then enter into your Closet, and pour out your hearts before <HI>God,</HI> and that will revive you. When that coward <HI>Satan</HI> sets upon an <HI>Aged</HI> man or wo|man, with his <HI>Assault</HI> and <HI>Battery,</HI> ei|ther to weaken their <HI>faith,</HI> or to unra|vel their <HI>repentance,</HI> or to cloud their <HI>comforts,</HI> their only course is to run to God by <HI>Prayer; God is a refuge for us.</HI> When we feel the decayes of <HI>Nature,</HI> and are almost overwhelmed with <HI>Di|stempers</HI> or <HI>Troubles,</HI> then let us by <HI>Pray|er</HI> cast <HI>our burden upon the Lord,</HI> and <HI>he will sustain us.</HI> Thus that learned and holy <HI>Rivet</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Rivet. ep. de bona senectute.</NOTE> did <HI>every</HI> day in his <HI>Old-age</HI> repeat the <HI>seventeenth</HI> and <HI>eigh|teenth verses</HI> of the <HI>seventy first Psalm.</HI>
<PB N="262" REF="136">
<HI>O God, thou hast taught me from my youth, and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. Now also when I am Old and gray|headed, O God, forsake me not, untill I have shewed thy strength to this generati|on, and thy power to every one that is to come.</HI></P>
<P>And here the <HI>Aged</HI> shall do well not only to plead their <HI>own Cause</HI> with God, but to lay up a stock for <HI>Posterity,</HI> that the generations yet <HI>unborn</HI> may be the better for them. Thus <HI>David,</HI> in that <HI>Psal.</HI> 72. 1. <HI>Give thy Iudgments to the King, O God, and thy righteousness to the Kings Son,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>So also you should be instant with the <HI>Lord</HI> for his <HI>Church, Truth,</HI> and <HI>Gospel.</HI> So was <HI>David, Psal.</HI> 122. So was <HI>Paul, alwayes in every Prayer of his.</HI> And we cannot better approve our selves to be <HI>members</HI> of that <HI>mystical Body,</HI> than by

our incessant <HI>Prayers</HI> for the <HI>Increase,</HI> the <HI>Unity</HI> and the <HI>Happiness</HI> thereof. And when you are thinking of your <HI>Countrey,</HI> of your <HI>Kindred,</HI> and of your <HI>Friends,</HI> add an <HI>Ejaculation</HI> to every of these your thoughts for a <HI>blessing</HI> upon them. These are Employments fit for a <HI>Christian Aged</HI> person, and will become them better, than endless <HI>Complaints,</HI> or groundless <HI>Presages.</HI> Pray, pray, and do not Pro|phesie, was holy Mr. <HI>Palmers</HI> saying to those, that were alwayes boding misery.

God</HI> hath in great Wisdom lodged his various gifts in divers subjects, that there may be a <HI>mutual dependance</HI> one upon another, and a <HI>mutual helpfulness</HI> of each to others. Thus he intrusts the <HI>Young</HI> with <HI>Strength</HI> to support and aid the <HI>Elder,</HI> whose strength is decayed; and the <HI>Aged</HI> with <HI>knowledge</HI> and <HI>wisdom</HI> to guide the young|er, whose judgment is yet unripe. And as it is a great misery, when the <HI>Aged</HI> are not relieved by the strength and in|dustry of those that are <HI>young,</HI> so it is a great infelicity, when the <HI>Aged</HI> are either unable or unwilling to instruct, or when those who are <HI>young</HI> are too <HI>careless</HI> or <HI>conceited</HI> to receive Instruction. That is therefore a barbarous Precept in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and like the rest of that <HI>Di|vinity, You are not obliged to lead men in</HI>

<HI>the right way, God guideth whom he listeth.</HI> But we <HI>have better learned Christ.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Discontentedness of mind.</HI> This is a Distemper to which <HI>Old-age</HI> is very liable. They <HI>want</HI> this, and they want that, which perhaps they have had heretofore, and they cannot bear these wants. One <HI>loss</HI> or <HI>cross</HI> befalls them, and e're they have well digested this, another comes. One while this <HI>Dis|ease</HI> or pain afflicts them, and that no sooner over, but they are smitten in ano|ther part, so that they are prone to perpe|tual murmurings.

<P>There is a <HI>Natural</HI> hardness in <HI>All</HI> men, there is an <HI>Habitual</HI> hardness in <HI>some</HI> men, but there is a <HI>Iudicial</HI> hard|ness only <HI>in such,</HI> as are ripe for hell.

<P>Let no <HI>Aged</HI> person imagine, that they are to live to no purpose.

<P>And <HI>another</HI> sort there are, that in stead of leaving any <HI>Blessing</HI> or benefit, do lay up a <HI>Curse</HI> for their <HI>Posterity;</HI> by leaving them <HI>Estates</HI> which they have got by <HI>Fraud</HI> and <HI>Injustice,</HI> or some <HI>unconscio|nable course;</HI> which is the ready way to melt away the rest how justly soever ob|tained.

<P>But these having bin touched before, that which remains for the <HI>Peace, Com|fort</HI> and <HI>good</HI> of <HI>Posterity,</HI> is a <HI>Prudent</HI> and <HI>seasonable Settling</HI> of your <HI>outward Estate.</HI> It is strange to see the great backwardness of many <HI>Aged</HI> persons to this work, as if making their <HI>Will</HI> would either <HI>lessen their Estates,</HI> or <HI>shorten their Lives,</HI> a gross and groundless <HI>Opinion;</HI> whereas the neglecting of this affair, hath a train of very <HI>ill consequences;</HI>

It is not enough, that we want <HI>strength,</HI> or <HI>opportunity</HI> to sin, but our <HI>wills</HI> and <HI>desires</HI> towards it, must be <HI>dead</HI> also.

<P>And as <HI>All sin</HI> must be the <HI>Object</HI> of <HI>Mortification,</HI> so especially all <HI>Youthful sins</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Hoc q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">i|dem p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">jus est, quod autorita|tem habe|mus senum, vitia ver&ograve; puerorum; nec puerorum tant&ugrave;m, sed etiam insantum. <HI>Sen.</HI> ep. 16.</NOTE>.

Let it be a warning to all <HI>Aged</HI> people, to see that their Corruptions be not <HI>asleep</HI> but <HI>dead,</HI> as far as is attainable in this life; that the <HI>Old man,</HI> as well as the <HI>outward man</HI> perish, and which will be a good proof thereof, that the <HI>inward man be renewed day by day.</HI> That our <HI>Thoughts,</HI> our <HI>Words,</HI> our very <HI>Behaviour</HI> and <HI>At|tire</HI> proclaim, that Sin and we are <HI>part|ed</HI> never to meet again.

<P>2. The <HI>Other Object</HI> of <HI>Mortification</HI> proper for <HI>Old-age,</HI> is <HI>The World</HI> and all the <HI>innocent,</HI> but <HI>charming</HI> vanities there|of. Not that they are bound <HI>actually</HI> to forsake the World, either the need|ful <HI>cares,</HI> or the lawful <HI>comforts</HI> of it: But to wean and abate their <HI>desires</HI> of it, their <HI>delights</HI> in it, their <HI>cares</HI> about it <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">When one <HI>Simi|lis</HI> a great Captain in <HI>Adrian</HI>'s time had retir'd into the Coun|trey <HI>seven</HI> years be|fore he di|ed, he caus|ed this <HI>Epi|taph</HI> to be prepared for him. <HI>Smilis hic jacet, cujus aetas quidem multorum annorum fu|it.

<P>It is the absurdest sight in the world, to see one <HI>gaping</HI> and grasping after <HI>this world,</HI> when he is <HI>going into ano|ther.

<P>So that the <HI>Aged</HI> person should be mortified to <HI>Life</HI> it self; he should be very well content to dy.

<P>And you will have need of <HI>Patience</HI> also, that after ye have <HI>done</HI> and <HI>suffer|ed</HI> the <HI>will of God,</HI> ye may <HI>receive the promise,</HI> Heb. 10. 36. So <HI>acute,</HI> or else <HI>tedious</HI> are some <HI>Distempers,</HI> that they will strain all the nerves of the Soul, to wrestle with them. Lay up there|fore, by diligent reading, hearing, me|ditation,

<P>Many <HI>useful</HI> things may be done in <HI>this life,</HI> which cannot be done by you when this life is ended.

<HI>draw Bills</HI> upon <HI>Almighty God</HI> by every good Work, which he will most faith|fully and fully pay in the Kingdom of Heaven.

<P>Bethink your selves therefore, which way you may yet do some good in the world.

<PB N="308" REF="159" MS="y">
on these things, for where the trea|sure is, there the heart will dwell also. I know some <HI>Constitutions</HI> of <HI>body</HI> are more capable of it than others, but certainly the more the soul is sanctified, that is, <HI>mortified</HI> to things below and <HI>vivified</HI> to things above, the more chear|fully will it dwell upon spiritual things; such as the <HI>Stomach</HI> is, such <HI>food</HI> will it desire.</P>
<P>But among other useful <HI>Points,</HI> The <HI>Aged</HI> is greatly concern'd to <HI>Meditate</HI> on <HI>Death,</HI> and the <HI>endless Life</HI> after it; which is, to pencill out before the Eyes of his mind the time of his <HI>Departure,</HI> the serious <HI>Circumstances</HI> and <HI>Consequen|ces</HI> of it. We should place our selves upon our <HI>Death-beds,</HI> gasping there for breath, our Friends ready to close our Eyes, the dabbe of flegme ready to stop our breath, and our Souls just forsaking the poor carkass. When we look upon our <HI>hands</HI> and <HI>feet,</HI> it should be attend|ed with these thoughts, that shortly they will be turn'd to <HI>rottenness;</HI> that the worms will make furrows in our faces, and feed upon our <HI>very hearts;</HI> yea that we at present do breed and nourish the <HI>vermine,</HI> that wait for to devour us: that e're long we shall have

nothing to do here, our house and goods in the possession of those that would be <HI>affrighted</HI> to see us again: that we must lodge a long time in the <HI>dark grave,</HI> and the Soul must go into an unknown world, and that unto all <HI>Eter|nity.</HI> These are thoughts for <HI>Aged</HI> per|sons; and not to&punc; be roving about things <HI>past</HI> to no purpose, or contriving about things of this world <HI>to come.</HI> This is in some sence to <HI>dy daily,</HI> to wit, by serious thoughts concerning <HI>our latter end.</HI></P>
<P>The truth is, this is a <HI>duty</HI> incumbent <HI>upon all.</HI> Hence that saying, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 29. <HI>O that they were wise, that they un|derstood this, that they would consider their latter end.</HI> A <HI>Deaths-head</HI> is no unfit furniture, for a <HI>young</HI> persons <HI>closet</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Vivere to|t&acirc; vit&acirc; dis|cendum est, &amp; quod magis for|tasse mira|beris tot&acirc; vit&acirc; discen|dum est mo|ri. <HI>Sen.</HI> de br. vit. <HI>c. 7.</HI></NOTE>. The serious apprehensions of the exceed|ing great change, which <HI>Death</HI> will make, would give a check to that <HI>wantonness, worldliness</HI> and <HI>vain-glory,</HI> which cleaves to us all by nature.

the <HI>Aged,</HI> who live in the <HI>con|fines</HI> of the <HI>grave.</HI> You should be ac|quainted with it, for you are <HI>neighbour's</HI> to it.

<P>These <HI>Meditations</HI> are certainly of great <HI>Excellence,</HI> and of great <HI>Use.

<P>And yet if <HI>Death,</HI> were only the <HI>fi|nishing of Life,</HI> these <HI>Thoughts</HI> about it were not so necessary or considerable: but we are assured of an <HI>Everlasting Life</HI> im|mediately following; that the extremest <HI>happiness</HI> or <HI>misery</HI> commences thereupon, which also <HI>never ends.</HI> Now what <HI>Thoughts</HI> or <HI>cares</HI> can be so momentous, as those about our endless <HI>Glory</HI> or <HI>Torment?</HI>

Sit down then, compose your selves to this <HI>Meditation;</HI> draw a Curtain over all this present World and your Con|cerns therein, and open a window into <HI>Eternity,</HI> and by <HI>Faith</HI> look steadily into it.

<P>Again, look <HI>Downward</HI> into that <HI>Bot|tomless Pit,</HI> and by <HI>faith</HI> behold the de|sperate condition of the <HI>Damned:</HI> lay your Ear to the Key-hole of <HI>Hell,</HI> and hearken a while to the weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth there.

<PB N="314" REF="162" MS="y">
racks and tortures of wofull <HI>Bodies,</HI> which must be as much beyond what the most cruel Malice can invent or act, as the Almighty and just indignation of <HI>God</HI> exceeds the weak and finite wrath of Man: And these to continue during the innumerable spaces of an unconceiv|able <HI>Eternity;</HI> and the <HI>Aged</HI> man must conclude, that there is no other way for him to take at <HI>Death,</HI> but into one of these <HI>Receptacles:</HI> and that he may just|ly expect by reason of his <HI>Age</HI> very short|ly to determine this point, that he is even <HI>at the door;</HI> that he hangs over this Etenity by a slender twist, which is now almost <HI>fretted</HI> through, and that before a few weeks or days are come, he must go <HI>the way whence he shall not return.</HI> What agitations of heart would these <HI>Meditations</HI> produce in us? what dili|gence in making our Calling and Ele|ction sure? what contempt of all the World? what detestation of the sweetest sins? In short, the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of <HI>Eternity</HI> would effectually disgrace the <HI>trifles of Time,</HI> and prepare the <HI>Aged</HI> for the in|joyment of it.</P>
<P>How comes it then to pass, that we are so <HI>backward</HI> to the thoughts of <HI>Death</HI> and the World to come? The truth is,
<PB N="315" REF="162" MS="y">
it is not gratefull to Flesh and Blood.

down within sight of the goal, loseth the race, and so loseth the <HI>things that he hath wrought: Si dixisti, sufficit, peri|isti.</HI> He that concludes, I have believ|ed or obeyed <HI>sufficiently,</HI> is a lost man. <HI>The hoary head must be still found in the way of righteousness,</HI> Prov. 16. 31. If our <HI>face</HI> be withered, yet we must take care that our <HI>faith</HI> be not withered. We should make it appear, that our <HI>spiritu|al heat</HI> or zeal did not result only from our <HI>natural heat</HI> and vigour. To see a <HI>young man wise,</HI> and an <HI>Old man zealous</HI> are most grateful objects to <HI>God</HI> and man. They are those <HI>that by patient con|tinuance in well doing, seek for glory and honour and immortality,</HI> that shall obtain <HI>eternal life,</HI> Rom. 2. 7.</P>
<P>And here let all <HI>Aged</HI> persons beware of the <HI>Rock</HI> of <HI>Carnal Security</HI> and <HI>Pre|sumption. Some</HI> of those that have lived long, are prone to rely upon their very <HI>Age</HI> as an Argument of Gods favour: Whereas <HI>Old-age</HI> will save no man. It may be a <HI>means</HI> of Salvation in a large sence, in affording you <HI>Space</HI> of Re|pentance: And it will be an <HI>aggrava|tion</HI> of your impenitence, in case you have such <HI>space,</HI> and yet not <HI>grace</HI> to re|pent: But otherwise it can make no
<PB N="320" REF="165" MS="y">
argument for your salvation; for <HI>God</HI> hath said, <HI>that the sinner being an hun|dred years old shall be accursed,</HI> Isa. 65. 20.</P>
<P>And <HI>Others</HI> that have been serious and serviceable in their dayes, may perhaps presume upon what they <HI>have been</HI> or <HI>have done,</HI> as if they might be <HI>justified</HI> thereby; or else that they need to take no further pains about their own Salva|tion or others good; whereas in <HI>the morning</HI> we must <HI>sow our seed,</HI> and not <HI>withhold our hand in the evening; for we know not whether shall prosper, either this or that; or whether they both shall be alike good:</HI> Which S. <HI>Hierom</HI> applies to this matter; Say not, saith he, I have been diligent while I was able; I may rest my self in mine <HI>Old-age;</HI> for thou know|est not, whether shall more please and honour <HI>God</HI> in thy Youth, or in thine Age <NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Hier. in <HI>Eccl. 11.</HI></NOTE>. Thus we read that when <HI>Old Mr. Knox</HI> was dying, he was assaulted with this proud Engine, what Service he had done his Master, which he pre|sently repelled with that of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 7. <HI>Who maketh thee to differ, and what hast thou that thou di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">st not receive?</HI> And the same <HI>Apostle</HI> had said a little before, <HI>ver.</HI> 4. <HI>I know nothing by my self, yet am I not hereby justified.</HI> Alas! <HI>all</HI> our
<PB N="321" REF="165" MS="y">
<HI>righteousness</HI> will not cover <HI>one</HI> of our <HI>Sins.</HI> We must say without a comple|ment, <HI>we are unprofitable Servants,</HI> when we have done our best. Neither may we imagine that any our former <HI>dili|gence,</HI> will excuse our future <HI>negligence.</HI> As long as we live we must <HI>not live to our selves</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Mallem mortuum esse quam non viveres <HI>Curius Dentatus.</HI></NOTE>, but we ought to <HI>live unto the Lord,</HI> Rom. 14. 7, 8. The <HI>ancient Ser|vant</HI> cannot do so much as he hath done, but he oversees affairs, he directs others in their imployments, his head is full of cares about his <HI>Masters</HI> busi|ness, and therein he dies and so must we. No man must think, saith <HI>Sene|ca</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Non ita|que quod quenquam propter ca|nos aut ru|gas putas diu vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">isse: non ille diu vixit, sed diu fuit. <HI>Sen.</HI> de br|vit. <HI>c. 8.</HI></NOTE>, that because of his gray hairs only or wrinkles he hath <HI>lived long;</HI> he may have <HI>indured long,</HI> but he hath not <HI>lived,</HI> unless he have <HI>improved</HI> his life. It was the honourable <HI>Epitaph</HI> of <HI>Abraham, Gen.</HI> 25. 8. <HI>He died in a good old age, an old man and full</HI>&mdash;there is no more in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> you may adde full of <HI>dayes,</HI> full of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Comfort,</HI> full of <HI>Hea|ven.</HI> And it was the comfortable in|couragement of <HI>Eliphaz</HI> to <HI>Iob,</HI> which was truly fulfilled unto him, <HI>Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in, in its sea|son,</HI> Job 5. 26. for he died <HI>old and full</HI>
<PB N="322" REF="166" MS="y">
<HI>of dayes,</HI> Job 42. <HI>last:</HI> he had lived as long as he could wish, and had lived to good purpose. He was full of dayes, and his dayes were full of good fruits.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Other</HI> branch of <HI>Perseverance</HI> is, in <HI>Suffering the will of God,</HI> or in <HI>Pas|sive Obedience.</HI> The Aged person must hold out herein to the end.

You cannot rea|sonably expect, but that at least some bodily distemper will last as <HI>long as your life,</HI> yea peradventure such <HI>painful dis|eases</HI> as will put all your <HI>patience</HI> to the rout, if the <HI>Lord</HI> be not your <HI>helper:</HI> but yet you must not <HI>murmur,</HI> nay you must not <HI>grudge,</HI> nor <HI>make hast;</HI> but in|dure the <HI>Lords pleasure,</HI> and wait the <HI>Lords leisure. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.</HI> The sight of the <HI>haven</HI> animates the weather|beaten <HI>mariner. Hitherto the Lord hath helped</HI> you, and <HI>as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</HI> He that hath put that compassi|on into the heart of a <HI>father,</HI> hath a surpassing infinite <HI>Ocean</HI> of it in himself<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Tam pa|ter nemo, tam pius nemo. <HI>Tert.</HI> de poenit. <HI>c. 8.</HI></NOTE>:
<PB N="323" REF="166" MS="y">
and withal <HI>he knows our frame, he re|members that we are but dust,</HI> Psal. 103. 13, 14.

<P>And therefore the <HI>Aged</HI> must beware of the <HI>other Extream,</HI> namely, the <HI>Gulf</HI> of <HI>Despondence,</HI> and <HI>Dejection of Spirit.</HI> Their <HI>Sins</HI> are mustered up against them, their outward <HI>strength</HI> is decayed, their <HI>Spirits</HI> broken with a succession of cares and troubles, their <HI>distempers</HI> and pains are heavy upon them, their <HI>friends</HI> and relations seem to be weary of them, and an unperswadable <HI>Enemy Death</HI> stands just before them. And what flesh alive can bear up under such and so many weights together! But besides what hath been offered before, I adde, that as all these <HI>Mortifications</HI> are need|ful to <HI>wean</HI> us from this world, from the love whereof even these can hardly divorce us; so all such <HI>Discomsorts</HI> should drive the <HI>Aged</HI> person no lower than his <HI>knees,</HI> even unto <HI>God</HI> who hath said, <HI>Be not dismayed, for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand</HI>
<PB N="324" REF="167" MS="y">
<HI>of my righteousness,</HI> Isa. 41. 10. Have not all the <HI>Saints</HI> and Servants of God that have lived to <HI>Old-age,</HI> pass'd these pikes before you? have they not <HI>born</HI> these burdens, that you <HI>sink</HI> under. There <HI>is no temptation befaln you,</HI> but <HI>what is common to men.</HI> Where is the <HI>faith,</HI> where are the <HI>prayers</HI> that you have been laying up for such a time? O miserable <HI>Old-man,</HI> said the <HI>Heathen Orator,</HI> that in so long a life, hast not yet learned to despise <HI>Death;</HI> which is not at all to be <HI>feared,</HI> if it extinguish the Soul; and greatly to be <HI>desired,</HI> if it convey the Soul into an everlasting good condition <NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">O mise|rum senem qui mortem contemnen|dam esse in tam longa aetate non viderit! quae qut plan&egrave; negligenda est, si omni|no extinguit animum, aut etiam appe|tenda si ali|qu&ograve; eum de|ducit, ubi sit futurus eter|nus.

And then for the pain in <HI>Death,</HI> the same <HI>Author</HI> tells us, that if there be any sense of pain <HI>in dy|ing,</HI> it is but very short; especially to <HI>Old people,</HI> that have prevented it and tasted it by degrees. And therefore ne|ver render your life or death unquiet as many do, that <HI>even dye for fear of dying,</HI> that create by their melancholy fancies greater torments to themselves, than <HI>Death</HI> brings with it. Behold it through the glass of <HI>Gods word,</HI> which represents it only as a <HI>Dissolution,</HI> to wit, out of a prison to <HI>go to Christ,</HI> Phil. 1. 23. <HI>Go|ing to rest,</HI> Isa. 57. 2. <HI>Finishing our course,</HI>

2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 8. <HI>Falling asleep in Iesus,</HI> 1 Thes. 4. 14. and a stepping out of this world <HI>unto our father,</HI> Joh. 13. 1. and why should the prospect hereof at all deject us? Yea, in case you should have the <HI>honour</HI> to be called to suffer <HI>Death</HI> for <HI>Christ,</HI> and his <HI>Truth;</HI> yet fear it not under its most <HI>terrible Aspect:</HI> for the <HI>Supports</HI> and <HI>Comforts</HI> of that <HI>Tryal</HI> will ballance, yea surmount the <HI>fears</HI> and <HI>pains</HI> thereof. <HI>As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abound|eth by Christ,</HI> 2 Cor. 1. 5. Strive there|fore rather to <HI>adorn,</HI> than to <HI>avoid</HI> the Cross: considering that, as it is a great honour for you in your <HI>Old-age</HI> to <HI>suf|fer for the Truth</HI> <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Bona se|nectus non vitae longe|vitate im|becilla ad usum; sed maturitat! virtutis ad martyrium preparata. <HI>Ambr.</HI> in Luc. <HI>l. 10.</HI></NOTE>, so it is a great shame, that the <HI>Truth</HI> should <HI>suffer by you.</HI> It was the worthy Resolution of <HI>Old Eleazar,</HI> when he was urged to counterfeit the eating of <HI>Swines flesh,</HI> to save his life: <Q>No, saith he, it beco|meth not our Age in any wise to dis|semble, whereby many young per|sons might think, that <HI>Eleazar</HI> being <HI>fourscore and ten,</HI> were now gone to a strange Religion.&mdash;And so they through my hypocrisie and desire to live a little time, should be deceived by me, and I get a stain to my Old|age,
<PB N="326" REF="168" MS="y">
and make it abominable. Where|fore now manfully changing this life, I will shew my self such an one as mine Age requireth.</Q> So <HI>Polycarp,</HI> when he was tempted to deny Christ, and to swear by the <HI>Fortune of Caesar,</HI> answered; <Q><HI>Fourscore and six</HI> years have I served <HI>Christ,</HI> and have found him a good Master, and should I now de|ny him? I have lived by him, and I will live and dye to him.</Q> Let us resolve, by <HI>Gods</HI> grace, to write after these Copies. Doubtless, if there be any going to Heaven on horse-back, as Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI> styles it, that is, in Ho|nour and State, it is by Martyrdom.</P>
<P>Nay, it is not enough, that we be <HI>con|tent</HI> and <HI>quiet</HI> under these <HI>discouragements,</HI> that we who have <HI>received good at the hands of the Lord,</HI> be <HI>content with evil also:</HI> but we should <HI>triumph</HI> over them. In <HI>all these things we should be more than conquerours through him that loved us.</HI> Our rooted <HI>Faith,</HI> our fixed <HI>Hope,</HI> our long <HI>Experience</HI> should lift us up to sur|mount all these fears and troubles. The veterane <HI>Soldier</HI> must not be scared with such <HI>Hydra's.</HI> We are near the promi|sed Land, the news of these <HI>Anakims</HI> in our way should not affright us, they
<PB N="327" REF="168" MS="y">

<P>And thus we are at length arrived at the end of the <HI>Aged</HI> persons <HI>Work,</HI> which was the <HI>Seventh</HI> and <HI>Last</HI> thing to be treated of in this <HI>Subject.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Practice</HI> of these things now only remains: That we study to <HI>correct</HI> the <HI>Causes, avoid</HI> the <HI>Sins, obtain</HI> the <HI>Graces, sustain</HI> the <HI>Inconveniences, improve</HI> the <HI>Priviledges,</HI> and <HI>dispatch</HI> the <HI>Work</HI> descri|bed before us.
