<P> All actions of poize better accomplish their wished ende, either by remunera|tion, or a dutifull affection (I si|lence both solid direction and adiument, which onely preuent errour, and supply de|fic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">encie) due reward the former, multi|plies and cheares vp endeauour, yet so bee|ing the base-borne birth of euery seruile nature, onely the last is the true loadstone of labour, this beeing the generous off|spring of vntainted liberall thoughts: Howeuer, we though saplesse branches of the happy oliue tree (our owne actions vn|sutable
<PB REF="3">
to demerit) may worthily declaime against the <HI>pioners</HI> of due desert (giue me leaue to vse that word) who bury it in base obliuion. Yet we all, I can truly a|vouch (as that Honourable oracle of wis|dome<NOTE PLACE="marg">Northampt.</NOTE> could say) doe happily liue vnder <HI>Li|bra,</HI> vnder the golden line of <HI>Iustice, mo|deration,</HI> and <HI>grace,</HI> so that we cannot tell whether nights or daies be more happily passed o're our heades. Yet this surely is (nether doth errour transport me) in re|gard<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iulian in his Casar.</NOTE> of our happie <HI>Marcus Philosophus,</HI> (whome <HI>Silenus</HI> in his <HI>pasquil</HI> could not carpe at, so worthie was his deportment) I say in respect of the <HI>Princely Head</HI> it selfe chiefly, to many the fountaine heade of honour; and as we may rightly say in generall (if considering <HI>Iustice</HI>) deriuing honourable equitie to all. Nor can I im|peach some of the <HI>noblest senses</HI> atten|dants on this head; who in a <HI>Iustice Geo|metricall</HI> are euer wont to parallel reward with merit, and not like <HI>Salomons sleeper</HI> to fold vp the chill hands of their fauour in their owne warme bosomes: yet the <HI>Muses</HI> may complaine the number of such are too fewe.</P>
<P>The auncient honours, fraunchises, and
<PB REF="3">
immunities of the <HI>Muses,</HI> the adoring of learning which was of olde, causeth those teares that then brast out of their faire cesternes for exultation, now in moderne time, to haue recourse back like <HI>Iordan</HI> to drowne the swolne heart in discontent: on|ly now our pennes doe shedde forth a many teares of inke, abundance of these droppes, the liuely resemblances of our sorow-duld, nay dead eyes: and this is the reason why all our pennes (I thinke) are more imploied now then wont, like silly <HI>Israelites</HI> ener ma|king vp the tale of bricke: to let the in|gratefull world see, that as gifts are more inhaunced, so the remunerating hand is much shortned.</P>
<P>Before the temple of <HI>Romulus</HI> there<NOTE PLACE="marg">Patricia. Plebeia. Plin. 15. 29.</NOTE> were <HI>two myrtles</HI> grew, the one <HI>Senatori|all,</HI> the other <HI>vulgar,</HI> for so they tearmed them: whiles the one was euer greene the other withered: there was an intercourse in their flourish and decay, two intimates of <HI>Senate</HI> and the <HI>Commonaltie,</HI> either of their languid authoritie, or of their flouri|shing dignitie: for when the Senate was in glory, the other was in subiection, and so the contrary. Fauour and dislike, reward, and neglect to learning and ignorance,
<PB REF="4">
wisedome and folly, be as them two myrtles to them two states: learning must needes flourish and dispread her golden bowes whiles the blessed beames of respect and fauour doe happily reflect vpon her:</P>
<P><HI>&mdash;Immensum gloria calcar habet:</HI> as the Poet saies fame, so fauour is a spurre: by this, learning (prizelesse in it selfe) gets it esteeme: whereas neglect of merit it dulls and rebates the quicker edge of all proceedings, and then folly (contemptible in it selfe) gets the vpperhand. Speake I all this, not as though your <HI>Honourable selfe</HI> (a knowne Patrone vnto learning) were in ecclips for deficiency that way, nor speake I this as if mine owne worthlesse action were worthie of the poize, or did basely expect reward, due to desert and not to me: but onely in their persons whose merit hath beene very much, and against them who haue very little esteemed it: for vertues and better parts most vsually like liuely sparks of Vestall fire, are rak't vp in embers of obscuritie: my speech doth ayme at some, who may, no doubt, peruse these lines with a blushing eye. What I harbour in my brest, I doe reserue to my owne vnsyllabled cogitations: and so much
<PB REF="4">
for the respectlesse world.</P>
<P>Now for your worthy <HI>Honour</HI> which I euer will esteeme, the dutifull affection I beare and euer will to it, hath beene a spurre to pricke me on (though free and ready of my selfe) amongst the troupe of Secretaries, to presume to offer vp this poore paper sacrifice as incense on <HI>Miner|va's</HI> shrine. My ruder hand wherein lear|ning is not palmestred, has onely pende what it could copie out of my cogitations, though surely first they leuild at a fairer marke, not soaring for a vulgar stoope. If I haue er'd, it is in loue and in constraint: as with a disease so with actions past: a disease at first is easily cured, but hardly seene: but in processe of time, it is easily seene, but hardly cured: so that nowe a fault can not be salued, except by the pre|tious balme of a more gratious accepta|tion.</P>
<P>Let this I pray your Honour, be attour|ney to plead for my defect, in that I, like the <HI>Syrens,</HI> who are wont in <HI>procella can|tare, in malacia lugere,</HI> to sing in a storme, and mourne in a calme, doe likewise, being incu~bred with other necessary occurences for my degree, tune these my vnpleasant
<PB REF="5">
notes, too rude a touch and harsh a melo|dy for a nimble apprehensiue court-like eare, which feedes daily on diuiner foode, on the <HI>Pythagorean harmonie</HI> that raui|shes the inward sense.</P>
<P>Concerning my subiect, it is nothing rare: for there is no soile in the whole <HI>Elysian</HI> field of diuine writ that lies fallow, vacant, and vnsowne, so toylesome euer hath beene the cunning hand of industrie in this fruitfull plot, both for <HI>Pauls</HI> plan|ting and <HI>Apollos</HI> watering, so that I might worthely haue put my stammering pen to silence: onely it pleasing his excellent Maiestie to daigne to grace with vnex|pected fauour these lines in words deliue|red to his vnderstanding eare, I so beeing called to their divulgation, did deeme it not vnmeet among the rest happily to hold the plowe, not looking backe so much as to mine own wants: &amp; therfore haue I chosen to shrowd this abortiue issue of my braine, vnder your <HI>Honours</HI> gracious wings, my selfe beeing happily couched vnder them alreadie, hauing sweete repose vnder the shade of that <HI>vine</HI> I most did affect, and whose clustred branches I wil euer honour both with my heart, my tongue, my penne
<PB REF="5">
and all. Humbly suiting your Honour for this, to entertaine these fewer drops of du|tifullnes distilled from the limbecke of an humble true heart and hand (vnanswera|ble either in their portion or proportion to your worth) which I wholly dedicate as a free will offering to your Honours sacred altar, as great an offerer (in a respectfull ballance) for this my <HI>silly Lambe,</HI> as they that sacrifice their <HI>Hecatombs.</HI> Daigne at your Honours vacancie to looke on it: the glorious sunne it selfe may without impeachment to his worth, cast his plea|sing rayes vpon the barrennest ground, as well as on the most fertile soile: so may the leaden mine partake as well the blessed hidden influence of heauenly starres, as the golden minerall without disgrace to con|stellation: and it may so come to passe, your Honour may gather hunnie from this homely weede. Thus in all humility reque|sting earnestly your Honours future grace and fauour, by whose gracious meanes my happier studies may be incouraged to wor|thyer tasks, as also my fortunes bettered: howeuer, beeing contented with the lowest ebbe, as it shall please the hand of proui|dence to dispose of me: whose fauour ne|uer
<PB REF="6">
was as yet to any like the Poets <HI>Tene|dos,</HI></P>

<P>And thus againe I humbly take my leaue. From my chamber in S. Iohns Col|ledge once graced with your Honours re|sidence. <HI>Iun. 28. 1608.</HI></P>

both strong meate, and milke, and deli|ces: I call them delices which are fit to to be knowne and pleasant, yet not so necessary, as that seuenth number where|of he makes a large discourse, and such like.

<Q>&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign">,</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vbivis auro contectum.</NOTE>
they rather bring in a famine, euen that lamentable famine in the Prophet, not a famine of bread and water, but a famine of the word of God; euen that famine<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos 8. 11.</NOTE> which sends a leannesse to the soule, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 106. 15.</NOTE> I may speake with the phrase of the bles|sed spirit.</P>
<P>The latter betters the speech: as the blind man did crie first in the flesh but<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marcus He|remita in l. de lege spi|rituali. i <GAP DESC="foreign">, then <GAP DESC="foreign">. answ. ie|houah.</NOTE> not in the spirit, but after he gan to see and was touched with the finger of faith, then he bettered his style. First, he cried, <HI>O thou sonne of Dauid,</HI> but after, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>O Lord, or sonne of God.</HI> But the former waxes worse and worse: like vnto their speech, that when Christ ridde in pompe to Ierusalem, cried, <HI>Hosanna,</HI> but<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 21. 9.</NOTE> when he was on the crosse, <HI>Hosineca: ho|sanna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 27. 22.</NOTE> that is, saue vs now: <HI>hosineca,</HI> that

<P>Now as <HI>Abigal</HI> said of <HI>Nabal,</HI> as his<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

For wisdome &amp; folly are two trees planted in the heart, which beare their diuerse fruit in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato.</NOTE> tongue: the heart it is natures cesterne of speach, and the tongue is the channell or conduit pipe to deriue it thence: as the one the source and welspring bubleth, so the other as the cocke it floweth either the sweete gush of the spiriruall rocke, I mean Iesus Christ, of whom Ioh. 7. neuer<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 7. 46.</NOTE> man spake as this man doth; or else the vnpleasant waters of <HI>Iericho</HI> that <HI>Elisha</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2.

<PB N="5" REF="8">
<GAP DESC="foreign">, and <GAP DESC="foreign">, the ring-leader and standerd of impietie, the open chalenger and oppugner of veritie: he spake one thing, saies he, with his mouth, and had taught his heart another thing. So <HI>Arrius</HI> that denied the <HI>coes|sentialitie</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naz. in orat. de laudibus Athan.</NOTE> of Iesus Christ, who as <HI>Nazi|anzen</HI> speaks, <GAP DESC="foreign">, paide dearely for his intemperate tongue: for as the histories record he voided out his bowells vpon a stoole: he swore in the <HI>Nicem Council</HI> that he beleeued as he had writ, (hauing two papers) to wit, according to that he had in his bosome secret, not that which he had in his hand open. So <HI>Herodian</HI> saies also of <HI>Severus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Herod. l. 2.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">: he harboured one thing in his brest, and hatched another thing in his tongue. Thus <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira</HI> plaid<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 5.</NOTE> the sophisters and hypocrites, lying to the holy Ghost. But we speake of cano|nicall and regular speach, as the schoole tearmes it, when speach is a true glosse to expresse the hidden text of the heart.</P>
<P>Oh then what a full cesterne of sweet water shall we thinke that sweete-soun|ding

And by the way, it is not an iniudicious note: the <HI>Hebrewe</HI> word for the heart is <HI>lev,</HI> (whereupon no doubt our <HI>liue</HI> comes) which consists of two letters, lamed and Beth, L, and B: L, is for <HI>lashon</HI> the tongue, the other B, for <HI>Beth,</HI> a house, to intimate thus much, that the heart ought to be <HI>Beth lashon,</HI> the house of the to~gue, wherein the tongue ought to dwell, and haue her continuall resi|dence.

Pet. 2. 11.</NOTE> God, and beeing conuerted seeks to con|uert others to God: it is he that here is the Preacher. We must not thinke with <HI>Dauid Kimchi,</HI> that <HI>Esay</HI> wrote both his owne prophesie, and the Canticles, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mercerus ex Baua bathra.</NOTE> this booke also, that he was the preacher; nor with the <HI>Talmudists,</HI> that <HI>Ezechiah</HI> and his adherents writ the booke which they call <HI>Iimshoch,</HI> that is, <HI>Esay,</HI> the <HI>Pro|verbs,</HI> the <HI>Song of Songs,</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiastes:</HI> but as <HI>Boaz</HI> saide to <HI>Ruth,</HI> gleane in no<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruth. 2. 8.</NOTE> other field but this: so let vs imbrace no other sinister opinion but this, that Sa|lomon was the penman of this book, that here he was this Preacher, who sought to finde out pleasant words.</P>
<P>They that auerre <HI>Salomon</HI> not be this preacher, the penman of this booke, doe
<PB N="15" REF="13" MS="y">
prooue it hence; because the booke is penitenciarie, and they constantly auouch that he neuer repented, but that he was damned to the gulfe of hell: of which thing, because comprized by methode within the lists of our Text, we will by Gods assistance treate a little.</P>
<P>Their chiefe Authorities to patronize their opinions are culled out of <HI>Augu|stine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. de civ. dei. 17. c. 20.</NOTE> one place in his booke of the <HI>citie of God,</HI> where he saies, that Salomon had good beginnings, but euill endings: se|condly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ad Faust&punc; Ma|nich. l. 22. c. 88. per tot. c.</NOTE> in his booke <HI>Ad Faust. Manich.</HI> The holy Scripture, sayes he, reprooues and condemnes Salomon, because no where we read of his repentance, and Gods indulgence. But the most strict place of all is in his commentary vpon the <HI>Psalmes:</HI> where he saies in plaine tearms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Psal. 126. in the midst of the enar|ration.</NOTE> <HI>Salomon reprobatus est &agrave; Deo,</HI> Salomon was reprobate of God, a cast-away as they interpret it. I know that some of the Fathers are diffident concerning the sal|uation of Salomon, and amongst them this Augustine as it seemes at a blush: yet notwithstanding they may be answered.</P>
<P>1 First for the first: be it that he began in the spirit and ended in the flesh, yet
<PB N="16" REF="14" MS="y">
this is not to be ment of his final ending, he died not in his sinnes: we know the iustest man he falls 7. times a day, that is often, yet he rises againe, and after his rising he still falls, when the finger of the holy Spirit holds him not vp: and euery fall (though not finall) may be called <HI>malus exitus;</HI> an euill ending, in regard of the holy rise which is a good beginning.</P>
<P>Or els thus he began to sway the scep|ter of his kingdome very wisely and re|ligiously, yet after he reuolted from God, especially in his old age, which may be called his <HI>exitus,</HI> yet so that ere he did depart this world, ere he were gathered to his fathers, he did clense his wayes, he did repent.</P>
<P>2 For the second, we wil answer with <HI>Bacchiarius (a Britaine, in Augustines</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacchiar. ad Ianuar. de l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">psis recip. med. cap.</NOTE> <HI>time)</HI> in a booke which he writ concer|ning a Monke that had committed adul|terie; sayes he, let vs graunt that in no place we read that Salomon repented: be it so: <HI>at acceptabilior erat poenitentia, pri|uat&acirc; eius conscienti&acirc; qu&agrave;m public&acirc; no|titi&acirc; ecclesiae:</HI> more gratefull to God was his penitencie in the closet of his owne heart, then by giuing publike notice to
<PB N="17" REF="14">
the Church.</P>
<P>3 For the last. The word <HI>reprobatus</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tertull. ad Iudaeos, a li|tle from the ende.</NOTE> doth not alwaies signifie, <GAP DESC="foreign">, as we take it for one in the state of the dam|ned, for a cast-away, but for one reproo|ued of God. So <HI>Tertullian</HI> speaking of the second comming of <HI>Christ,</HI> saith, that Christ <HI>post reprobationem fuit as|sumptus,</HI> after his reprobation was ta|ken vp: now what blasphemous tongue would euer say that Christ was a repro|bate? So Salomo~ was reprooued of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iren. 4. hae|res. 45.</NOTE> as he was of the Scripture. <HI>Ireneus</HI> after he had recited the good gifts that God had inriched Salomon withall out of the rich exchequer of his vnspeakable bountie and mercy, about the midst of the chapter he saies, that he fell grie|uously, and was tainted with the polluti|on of outlandish women, yet saies he, <HI>sufficienter eum increpavit scriptura, v|ti dixit mihi presbyter, vt ne gloriare|tur vniuersa caro in conspectu Domini.</HI> Whe~ce we may gather these two things: 1. that he was reprooued of the Scrip|ture, as we spake before: 2. that the word of God so sufficiently wrought vpon his heart, that it caused him to re|pent,
<PB N="18" REF="15">
yet <HI>Ireneus</HI> speaks it from the rela|tion of a Priest. I confesse Austen in the last place quoted out of his comment. vpon the Psal. speakes very preiudicious|ly of Salomon, as may be gathered out of his succeeding words, where he takes away the argument deriued from his penmanship. But if he vncharitably and sinisterly censured this holy man, it was no doubt a blemish in him: &amp; perchance rather to deterre and affright euery soule from falling so low, then peremptorily and preiudiciously to determine of his damnation: we may say as Augustine himselfe sayes in another case of Saint <HI>Cyprian,</HI> who held the <HI>Anabaptization</HI> of hereticks, so of Augustine, this was peraduenture, <HI>magis discendi modestia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">August. cont. Donatist.</NOTE> <HI>quam docendi diligentia.</HI></P>
<P>For their reason it is this. Because his soule was so deepely tainted with Idola|trie, and loue of his concubines: and if he had repented, say they, we should haue read of his taking away the high altars before his death. But to answer. Al|though his soule was, <HI>dibapho peccati tincta,</HI> dyed in a crimsen dye of sinne, yet he that came with redde garments
<PB N="19" REF="15" MS="y">
from <HI>Bozrah,</HI> who trod the wine-presse<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 63. 1, 2, 3</NOTE> of Gods wrath alone, he that sate vpon the white horse, whose eyes were like a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reuel. 19. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE> flame of fire, and on his head a many crownes, who had a name writ that no man knewe but himselfe, whose gar|ment was dipt in blood, he, he could purge him with hysope, he no doubt could make the scarlet soule of <HI>Salomon.</HI> as white as the snow in <HI>Salmon.</HI></P>
<P>Againe, what if he were for a time fascinated &amp; bewitched so with the loue of his concubines, that for their sakes he followed <HI>Ashtaroth</HI> the god of the <HI>Si|donians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. King. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Chemosh</HI> the god of the <HI>Moa|bites,</HI> and <HI>Milchom</HI> the god of the <HI>Am|monites,</HI> yet no doubt he might before his death command these abominations to be ruinated and defaced, which were not peraduenture, and which he beeing bedred it may be could not in his owne person by reason of his too long delay, see throwne downe.</P>
<P>And by the way, nor is it a <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambrose vp|on S. Luke.</NOTE> <HI>S. Ambrose</HI> saith, God permitted <HI>Salo|mon</HI> thus grieuously to fall, least the Iews might be deceiued and thinke,&mdash;<HI>pro|missum diuinum ad illum manasse&punc;</HI> and so
<PB N="20" REF="16" MS="y">
consequently that he was the Messias.</P>
<P>But with authoritie and reason coun|terpoised against their vngrounded cen|sure for any thing I see, we will prooue directly that he repented, and so was saued. I will onely mention that place in <HI>Ecclesiasticus,</HI> in which chapter is set<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesiast. 47.</NOTE> out the prayse of <HI>Nathan, Dauid,</HI> and <HI>Salomon:</HI> it is there saide <HI>Salomon</HI> felt sorrowe for his folly, but God left not off his mercie to him, nor did he destroy him for his workes, <GAP DESC="foreign">, which I thinke may be interpreted well; he wip't him not out of the booke of life, beeing the posteritie of <HI>Dauid</HI> whom he loued.</P>
<P><HI>Hierome</HI> vpon <HI>Ezekiel</HI> cites a place<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hierom. in 43. Ezech. Prov. 24. 32. Septuag.</NOTE> out of the Prouerbs in the <HI>Septuagints</HI> translation, where <HI>Salomon</HI> thus speakes of himselfe, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c. that is, at the length I repen|ted, and beheld, &amp;c. I know the <HI>Hebrew</HI> runnes not so, for thus, <HI>vaechezeh an&ocirc;chi ashith libbi,</HI> &amp;c. then I beheld and laid it to my heart, and looked vpon it, and re|ceiued instruction. Where the fault is, it is not at this time to be discussed, since it requires an ample discourse, and I would not become tediously irkesome: for, as
<PB N="21" REF="16">
<HI>Nazianzen</HI> saies, <GAP DESC="foreign">:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazian. orat. de Sanc&punc; bap.</NOTE> that is, satietie in speach is as great on enemie to the eare, as surfet to the body. But this is not onely <HI>Hieromes</HI> but also <HI>Cyril the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cyrill.</NOTE> <HI>Archbishop of Alexandria</HI> his allegation, who cites also this very place out of the Septuagints in his booke <HI>de Baptismo.</HI> But <HI>Bacchiarius</HI> in his fore-mentioned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baechiar. ad Ianuar.</NOTE> booke, he brings in this reason that he was repentant, and so saued. All the god|ly kings, saies he, are reported in the Scripture to haue beene buried among the kings of Israel their fathers in the ci|tie of <HI>Dauid,</HI> amongst which <HI>Salomon</HI> as a godly king is said to be thus buried: but it is not read of the wicked kings, as <HI>Ie|roboam, Ahab,</HI> and the rest, that they were thus buried: therefore it is likely that <HI>Salomon</HI> was saued, that he did re|pent in the iudgement of the church: but let them that can discerne see into this reason.</P>
<P>In briefe our plaine arguments to prooue his saluation, are these.</P>
<P>1 <HI>First,</HI> In the 2. of Samuel, Salomon<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Sam. 12. 25.</NOTE> is caled <HI>Iedidah</HI> by Nathan the Prophet, at the command of the Lord: the word
<PB N="22" REF="17" MS="y">
signifieth, beloued of the Lord: and so sayes the text, because the Lord loued him: now whom the Lord loues, he loues to the ende: and therefore he was saued.</P>
<P>2 <HI>Secondly,</HI> He was a sacred Scribe and penman of the Canonicall Scripture, inspired by the holy Ghost, as all other Prophets were; which thing besuits not any reprobate: now it is saide in S. Luke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 13. 28.</NOTE> that all the Prophets of God are, <GAP DESC="foreign">, in the kingdome of God: therefore to seclude <HI>Salomon</HI> one of the Prophets from the kingdome of heauen, were to denie the Scriptures.</P>
<P>3 <HI>Thirdly,</HI> He calls his former waies madnesse and folly, therefore it is proba|ble,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 2. 12.</NOTE> that he seeing in the Scriptures mir|rour and looking glasse, his owne blemi|shes and fowle deformites, that he washt away the spots of his soule by the troubled waters of <HI>Bethesda,</HI> the teares of true repentance.</P>
<P>4 <HI>Fourthly,</HI> He was the liueliest type of Iesus Christ the true <HI>pacificus</HI> the true Salomon, that euer was, saue <HI>Melchise|deth.</HI></P>
<P>To say then that he who was thus bu|ried among the faithfull for a faithfull
<PB N="23" REF="17">
man in the citie of Dauid with the kings of Israel his fathers, who was sufficiently reprooued, and so co~sequently amended by the holy Scripture, who was the loue|ly darling of God, the penman of heaue~ly writ, one of the sanctified Prophets, who was so liuely a resemblance of our Saui|our Christ, who saw into his owne mad|nesse and folly, that he, he I say was dam|ned, withstands reason, denies Scripture, and iniuries the dead in the Lord: and I verily am perswaded in my soule &amp; con|science, that his portion is fallen in a faire ground, that his inheritance is in the land of the liuing. And thou O my soule inioy for euer that blessed paradise he now happily doth bathe himselfe in: &amp; giue me leaue to end this point with the Poet, Happie and thrise happie are them soules,</P>
<P><HI>Qu&ecirc;is datur Elysium sic habit are nemus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sannazarius.</NOTE> who thus are made free denizens in that heaue~ly <HI>Ierusalem</HI> the citie of the Saints. And thus I conclude, that Salomon he was this Preacher, and penman of this penitentiall booke, with making this short double vse vnto our selues: 1. let him that stands, take heede least he fall:
<PB N="24" REF="18" MS="y">
2. let euery one vpon the bended knee of his heart humbly desire the Lord to conuert him; then being conuerted, with Salomon let him conuert his brethren. Now will I come nearer vnto this first word, <HI>Coheleth, or Preacher.</HI></P>
<P>As the Prophet saies of Ierusalem the earthly Eden of pleasure, the navil of the world, the cathedrall sea of God, Many excellent things are spoken of thee, O thou citie of God: so we may say of Sa|lomon, many glorious titles are giuen to thee, O thou man of God. Diuerse singu|lar men haue had other names for their excellencie, as <HI>Origen</HI> was called <HI>Ada|mantius:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Erasm in vit. Origen.</NOTE> <HI>Iohannes Constantinopol.</HI> for his mellifluous eloquence was called <HI>Chry|sostome: Basil</HI> was called <HI>Magnus: Gre|gorie Nazianz.</HI> for his worthie disputa|tions in diuinitie was called <HI>Theologus.</HI> Thus he that was <HI>Saul</HI> before his con|uersion as <HI>Sheol</HI> or hell, was after called<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hierom.</NOTE> <HI>Paul,</HI> that is, <HI>mirabilis,</HI> wonderfull, or <HI>os tubae,</HI> the mouth of the trumpet of the Lord, though there be no great sub|stance in that. But King Salomon as a man specially graced with rarest parts, has sundry excellent and worthy names:
<PB N="23" REF="18">
as first <HI>Salomon,</HI> that is, a peacemaker; then <HI>Iedidah,</HI> that is, beloued of the Lord; then <HI>Ithiel,</HI> that is, God with me; then <HI>Agur,</HI> that is, gathering toge|ther, and so in the same sense here in<NOTE PLACE="marg">cahal congrega|vit.</NOTE> this booke, and in this place is he tear|med <HI>Coheleth,</HI> or <HI>Ecclesinstes,</HI> or the prea|cher, because like the sound of <HI>Aarons</HI> golden bells, he calls the flocke of Iesus Christ together by his heauenly &amp; plea|sant words.</P>
<P>The Hebrew word <HI>Coheleth</HI> is here of the <HI>feminine gender,</HI> as the learned know, as if he called himselfe the shee preacher, or the woman preacher. Because as some say, he writ it when he was <HI>satur annis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesiast. 12</NOTE> very aged, when they began to wax dark that looke out by the windows, when all the daughters of singing were abased, when his Almond tree began to flourish, &amp; the grashopper was a burden to him, when his siluer corde was lengthened, and the golden ewre broken: when he was as <HI>Nazianz.</HI> speakes of <HI>Eleazar,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, gray|headed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazian. orat. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="foreign">.

<PB N="26" REF="19">
his manlike strength once failed him, when he was by age as weake as wo|man the weaker sex, at the very brink of death, then he writ this booke, and calls himselfe the woman preacher; which confirmes the former assertion of the <HI>Hebrues,</HI> that this was his last booke, his <HI>palinodia,</HI> his sweet recantation, like the swanne on the bankes of <HI>Maeander.</HI>

<P>The second thing I intend by Gods assistance to speake of, is the obiect that Salomon aimed at, that is, <HI>pleasant words.</HI></P>
<P>Whiles the minstrell plaied, <HI>Elisha</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. king. 3. 15.</NOTE> prophesied: so whiles the Spirit of God sings sweete melodious harmonie vnto the soule, each corporeal part must needs be tuneable to euery heauenly action:
<PB N="40" REF="25">
there will be no iarring, no discordancie at all: the soule to the limmes of the bo|die, is like the <HI>Centurion</HI> to his seruants; if it say to one goe, it goeth, to another come, it commeth, if to another doe this, it doth it: heauenly is that motion, that action, that comming, where the spirit hauing happie residence commands. If the spirit say vnto thy right hand, doe good, it will in bountie and pitie cast thy bread vpon the waters; that is the teare-bedeawed cheeks, the wet faces of the poore afflicted members of Christ: if to thy feete, walke, presently they will runne the waies of Gods commaunde|ments: if to thine eyes, weepe, they will euery night water thy couch with teares, they will burst out into a fountaine, they will gush out riuers of teares, because men keepe not the law of God: so if the spirit say vnto the tongue, speake, &ograve; how wil it then shew forth the praise of God, how will it edifie; how will it flowe out these <HI>diure kephets,</HI> these pleasant words?</P>
<P>Thus Salomon his strings of his tongue were in tune with the strings of his heart, and they both are melodiously strucke with the learned and cunning finger of

the blessed spirit, the sweetest musician that euer strucke the heart as a harpe, and the tongue as a sweet cymball: therefore Salomon hauing the spirit his schoole|master, must needs learne to speake well, which he earnestly thirsts after.</P>
<P>He did not as <HI>Lucian</HI> saies, <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucian. in Pseudolog.</NOTE> cast out a mierie vomite of words, like the wicked in the prophet, The vngodly are like the raging sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esa. 57. 20.</NOTE> whose waters cast vp mire and dirt: he spoke not with a heart and a heart like <HI>Pilate,</HI> who in that was but a bad vnskil|ful pilate in running the ship of his soule to peeces against the rocke Christ Iesus the spirituall rocke: he spoke not like your hypocrits, (who are the deuills re|tainers in Gods liueries) rather from his heart, then (as they) farre from his heart: for sure as his tongue was, so was his heart, and as his heart was, so was his tongue, like the <HI>wheeles of Ezechiel,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezech. 10. 10</NOTE> one wheele in another: and fitly to wheeles: for in that text Prouerbs<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 25. 11.</NOTE> 25. in the Hebrue thus it runnes, A word spoken [not in his due place] but <HI>gnal aphnau,</HI> vpon his wheeles, is like apples of gold with pictures of siluer.</P>

<P>2 <HI>Secondly for paucitie.</HI> Our words ought to be few, for in much speaking, there is much iniquitie: and Salomon saies in his morall diuine philosophie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 17. 27.</NOTE> He that hath knoweledge, spareth his words.

Thus also is the tongue as a guil|tie poore prisoner, tied as it were in chaines, in fetters, and strings in the mouth, that it should not breake out in blasphemie against God, against man, a|gainst it owne soule.</P>

<P>3 <HI>Thirdly,</HI> words ought to be de|lightsome, and they be twofold, either pleasing the outward eare, or touching the inward heart: of both which a wise man (who both is wont to doe things

<P>A wise speaker that meanes to speake pleasant words, will regard time, place, subiect, obiect, and ende, and euery cir|cumstance.</P>
<P><HI>For place.

<P><HI>For time</HI> and <HI>subiect</HI> also. Thus Abi|gail the prudent wife of the foole Nabal the Carmelite, would not reprooue her husband (for reuiling <HI>Dauid,</HI> and dealing churlishly with him) whiles hee was drunke and too much merrie with wine, but in the morning most wisely, when
