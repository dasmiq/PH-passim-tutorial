<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>PRefaces being generally to prepossess the Reader of a good Opinion of the Performance, how trifling soever; and commonly, Mountebank like, the meaner the Book the more Encomiums in the Preface; which you will be deceived of here, for I shall only give you matter of Fact, how this Book came to be publish'd.</P>
<P>About four months ago I sent into the World a Collection of Poems on <HI>Affairs of State,</HI> from the time of <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> to the time of King <HI>James II.</HI> Written by the greatest Wits of the Age, <HI>viz.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> Lord <HI>Rochester,</HI> Lord <HI>B&mdash;st,</HI> Mr. <HI>Milton, And. Marvell</HI> Esquire, Mr. <HI>Sprat,</HI> Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> Mr. <HI>Waller, &amp;c.</HI> which being found to be genuine, met with good Acceptance; Since that Book came out, a great many excellent Poems have been sent me from very good hands, pressing to have a Continuation thereof made, which at last I resolved to do, upon the receiving some Co|pies of Verses printed at <HI>Oxford, 1654.</HI> in praise of <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> on his making Peace with the <HI>Dutch</HI>; finding several Persons, who now make the greatest figure in the Common-wealth of Learning to be concerned therein, I thought the World would be willing to see what such Great Men
<PB REF="3">
as Dr. <HI>South,</HI> Mr. <HI>Locke, &amp;c.</HI> said on such an extraordinary Occasion, I have printed their own <HI>Latin,</HI> and kept strictly to their Sense in the Transla|tion, and those they wrote in <HI>English</HI> are also pub|lished, this begins the Book. Then follow several excellent Poems, written by the Lord <HI>Rochester,</HI> Esquire <HI>Marvell, &amp;c.</HI> during the Reign of King <HI>Charles II.</HI> omitted in the former Collection: As also those writ in the Reign of King <HI>James II.</HI> by the Lord <HI>D&mdash;t.</HI> Sir <HI>F. S</HI>&mdash;, Mr. <HI>Prior,</HI> Mr. <HI>Step|ney,</HI> Mr. <HI>Rymer,</HI> &amp;c. and particularly those in|comparable Pieces of the <HI>Hind</HI> and <HI>Panther</HI> trans|vers'd to the Story of the <HI>City-Mouse</HI> and <HI>Coun|try-Mouse,</HI> and the <HI>Man of Honour,</HI> written by the Honourable Mr. <HI>M&mdash;ue.</HI> And since the Re|volution, you have several Copies, writ by the Lord <HI>Cutts,</HI> Mr. <HI>Tate,</HI> Mr. <HI>Shadwell,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ayloffe, &amp;c.</HI> Lastly&punc; some Miscellany Poems, by the same Great Men, <HI>never before Printed.</HI> And in this Colle|ction Names are not made use of to countenance spu|rious Pieces, but the Poems themselves speak the Great|ness of their Authors, if no Name had been thereto.</P>
<P>In short the said <HI>State-Poems,</HI> and this <HI>Conti|nuation</HI> thereof, make a <HI>Compleat Collection</HI> of all that are valuable in that nature, for these forty years; and is the best <HI>Secret History</HI> of our late Reigns, as being writ by such great Persons as were near the Helm, knew the Transactions, and were a|bove being brib'd to flatter, or afraid to speak truth. And so I leave them to the Reader.</P>

<HEAD>The Second Advice to a <HI>PAINTER.</HI> By the Author of the first.</HEAD>
<L>NOW <HI>Painter</HI> try if thy skill'd hand can draw,</L>
<L>The horrid'st Scene the trembling World e'er saw.</L>
<L>Wipe all your Pencils that the former drew,</L>
<L>In dismal colours dip them all anew;</L>
<L>Colours that may in lively parts express</L>
<L>The plotted Fall of Monarchs; in a Dress</L>
<L>May fright the World: Crimes which we can't atone</L>
<L>With our best Blood, and Christians blush to own.</L>
<L>But let me first advise you, e'er you take</L>
<L>This work in hand, a small Reflection make,</L>
<L>Of all that's heinous, Murthers, Treasons, Fires,</L>
<L>Perjuries, Incests, Rapines, hot Desires</L>
<L>Of murthering Kings, I tremble to rehearse,</L>
<L>A tottering World and sinking Universe.</L>
<L>Think well on these, e'er you begin the part,</L>
<L>'Twill heighten Fancy, and affect your Heart.</L>
<L>In the upper part of all the Canvas paint</L>
<L>His Holiness the Pope, that mighty Saint,</L>
<L>Old <HI>Satan</HI> his Associate too must stand</L>
<L>Behind his Chair, to guide his heart and hand.</L>
<L>Draw him stuck round with all the Toys that come,</L>
<L>From the grand Mint of Lies, old foppish <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
<L>Bulls, Dispensations, Pardons all the baits</L>
<L>He lays for the dull Crowd; the Book of Rates</L>
<L>Will be convenient too, that of every Sin</L>
<L>The value may be known, pray cram them in</L>
<L>Draw him dispersing with a bounteous hand,</L>
<L>For horrid Ends, the Treasures of his land:</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="28">Dispensing with false Oaths, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> any thing.</L>
<L>So that they'll murther <HI>Charles, Great-Britain's</HI> King.</L>
<L>Poor Fool! to think the Guardian of his Throne</L>
<L>Is grown so dull, and senseless as his own,</L>
<L>No, proud Imposture, no, thy Hand's too short</L>
<L>To reach his Head, or make his fall thy sport.</L>
<L>Next draw proud <HI>France,</HI> and his ambitious hope</L>
<L>Of being mighty cringing to the Pope,</L>
<L>'Tis not his Zeal to him, or to his Laws,</L>
<L>That cheats the World, this his Affection draws.</L>

<L>You feast your senses, at such costly Rates,</L>

<L>But when both base, degenerate they're grown,</L>
<L>The Vulgar hurl them headlong from the Throne.</L>
<L>Go on, vile Prince, in all these Arts and try</L>
<L>How soon your Crown will fade, your Empire die.</L>
<L>By your Example your own Subjects teach,</L>
<L>To strike at Empire, and at Sceptres reach;</L>
<L>And may their first attempt be on thy Head,</L>
<L>Dethrone thee first of all, then strike thee dead.</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Favourers of the <HI>Hind</HI> and <HI>Panther</HI> will be apt to say in its Defence, That the best things are capable of being turn'd to Ridicule; that <HI>Homer</HI> has been Burlesqu'd, and <HI>Virgil</HI> Travested without suffering any thing in their Reputation from that Buf|foonry; and that in like manner, the <HI>Hind</HI> and the <HI>Panther</HI> may be an Exact Poem, though 'tis the Subject of our Raillery: But there is this difference, That those Authors are wrested from their true Sense, and This naturally falls into Ridicule; there is nothing Represented here as monstrous and unnatural, which is not equally so in the Original. First as to the General Design, Is it not as easy to imagine two <HI>Mice</HI> bilk|ing Coachmen, and supping at the <HI>Devil,</HI> as to suppose a <HI>Hind</HI> entertaining the <HI>Pan|ther</HI> at a <HI>Hermit's Cell,</HI> discussing the greatest Mysteries of Religion, and telling you&punc; her Son <HI>Rodriguez</HI> writ very good Spanish? What can be more improbable and
<PB N="68" REF="39">
contradictory to the Rules and Examples of all Fables, and to the very design and use of them? They were first begun and raised to the highest Perfection in the <HI>Eastern</HI> Countries; where they wrote in Signs, and spoke in Parables, and deliver|ed the most useful Precepts in delightful Stories; which for their Aptness were en|tertaining to the most Iudicious, and led the Vulgar into understanding by surprizing them with their Novelty, and fixing their Attention. All their Fables carry a double meaning; the Story is one and intire; the Characters the same throughout, not broken or chang'd, and always conformable to the Nature of the Creatures they intro|duce. They never tell you that the Dog which snapt at a Shadow, lost his Troop of Horse, That would be unintelligible; a piece of Flesh is proper for him to drop, and the Reader will apply it to Mankind; they would not say that the Daw, who was so proud of her borrow'd Plumes, lookt ve|ry ridiculous when <HI>Rodriguez</HI> came and took away all the Book but the <HI>17</HI>th, <HI>24</HI>th, and <HI>25</HI>th Chapters, which she stole from him: But this is his new way of telling a Story, and confounding the <HI>Moral</HI> and the <HI>Fable</HI> together.</P>
<Q><PB N="69" REF="39">
<L>Before the Word was written, said the Hind,</L>
<L>Our Saviour Preacht the Faith to all Mankind.</L></Q>
<P>What relation has the <HI>Hind</HI> to our Sa|viour? Or what notion have we of a <HI>Pan|ther's</HI> Bible? If you say he means the Church, how does the Church feed on Lawns, or range in the Forest? Let it be always a Church, or always the cloven-footed Beast, for we cannot bear his shifting the Scene every Line. If it is absurd in Comedies to make a Peasant talk in the strain of a <HI>Hero,</HI> or a Country Wench use the Language of the Court; how monstrous is it to make a Priest of a Hind, and a Parson of a Panther? To bring 'em in disputing with all the Formalities and Terms of the School? Though as to the Argu|ments themselves, those, we confess, are suited to the Capacity of the Beasts; and if we would suppose a Hind expressing her self about these Matters, she would talk at that Rate.</P>
<P>As to the Absurdity of his Expressions, there is nothing wrested to make 'em ridi|culous, the terms are sometimes alter'd to make the Blunder more visible; <HI>Know|ledge
<PB N="70" REF="40">
misunderstood</HI> is not at all better sense than <HI>Understanding misunderstood,</HI> though 'tis confest the Author can play with words so well, that this and twenty such will pass off at a slight reading.</P>
<P>There are other mistakes which could not be brought in, for they were too gross for <HI>Bayes</HI> himself to commit. 'Tis hard to conceive how any Man could censure the <HI>Turks</HI> for Gluttony; a People that debauch in Coffee, are voluptuous in a mess of Rice, and keep the strictest <HI>Lent,</HI> without the Pleasures of a <HI>Carnival</HI> to encourage them. But 'tis almost impossible to think that any Man who had not renounced his Senses, should read <HI>Duncomb</HI> for <HI>Allen:</HI> He had been told that Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> had writ|ten a Discourse of Humility;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Difference betwixt a</HI> Protestant <HI>and</HI> Soci|nian, <HI>p. 62.</HI></NOTE> to which he wisely answers, That that magnified Piece of <HI>Duncomb</HI>'s was Translated from the <HI>Spanish</HI> of <HI>Rodriguez</HI>; and to set it be|yond dispute,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Page 92.</HI></NOTE> makes the infallible Guide affirm the same thing. There are few mistakes, but one may imagine how a Man fell into them, and at least what he aim'd at; but what likeness is there between <HI>Duncomb</HI> and <HI>Allen?</HI> do they so much as Rhime?</P>
<P>We may have this comfort under the severity of his Satyr, to see his Abilities
<PB N="71" REF="40">
equally lessen'd with his Opinion of us; and that he could not be a fit Champion against the <HI>Panther</HI> till he had laid aside all his Iudgment.

<L><HI><HI>Jack Squabb,</HI> his History in little drawn</HI></L>
<L><HI>Down to his Evening, from his early dawn.</HI></L>
</LG>
<L>APpear thou mighty Bard, to open view;</L>
<L>Which yet we must confess you need not do:</L>
<L>The labour to expose thee we may save,</L>
<L>Thou stand'st upon thy own Records, a Knave;</L>
<L>Condemn'd to live in thy Apostate Rhimes,</L>
<L>The Curse of Outs, and Scoff of Future Times.</L>
<L>Still tacking round with every turn of State</L>
<L>Reverse to <HI>Sh&mdash;ry</HI> thy cursed Fate</L>
<L>Is always at a change to come too late:</L>
<L>To keep his Plots from Coxcombs was his Care,</L>
<L>His Policy was mask'd, and thine is bare:</L>
<L><PB N="129" REF="69">Wise Men alone cou'd guess at his Design,</L>
<L>And cou'd but guess, the Thred was spun so fine:</L>
<L>But every pur-blind Fool may see through thine.</L>
<L>Had <HI>Dick</HI> still kept the Regal Diadem,</L>
<L>Thou hadst been Poet Laureat to him,</L>
<L>And, long e're now, in Lofty Verse proclaim'd</L>
<L>His high Extraction, among Princes Fam'd;</L>
<L>Diffus'd his Glorious Deeds from Pole to Pole,</L>
<L>Where Winds can carry, and where Waves can rowl.</L>
<L>Nay, had our <HI>Charles,</HI> by Heav'ns severe Decree,</L>
<L>Been found, and Murther'd in the Royal Tree,</L>
<L>Ev'n thou hadst prais'd the Fact; his Father slain,</L>
<L>Thou call'dst but gently breathing of a Vein:</L>
<L>Impious and Villanous! to bless the blow</L>
<L>That laid at once three lofty Nations low,</L>
<L>And gave the Royal Cause a fatal Overthrow.</L>
<L>What after this cou'd we expect from thee?</L>
<L>What cou'd we hope for, but just what we see?</L>
<L>Scandal to all Religions, New and Old;</L>
<L>Scandal to thine, where Pardon's bought and sold,</L>
<L>And Mortgag'd Happiness redeem'd for Gold:</L>
<L>Tell me, for 'tis a Truth you must allow;</L>
<L>Who ever chang'd more in one Moon, than thou?</L>

<L>He had but one Religion, or had none:</L>
<L>What Sect of Christians is't thou hast not known,</L>
<L>And at one time or other made thy own?</L>
<L>A Bristled <HI>Baptist</HI> bred; and then thy Strain</L>
<L>Immaculate, was free from sinful Stain.</L>
<L>No Songs in those blest times thou didst produce</L>
<L>To brand and sham good Manners out of use:</L>
<L>The Ladies then had not one Bawdy Bob,</L>
<L>Nor thou the Courtly Name of Poet Squab.</L>

<L>More by thy Int'rest, than thy Nature so.</L>
<L>Under his livening Beams thy Laurels spread;</L>
<L>He first did place that Wreath about thy Head;</L>
<L>Kindly reliev'd thy wants, and gave thee Bread.</L>
<L>Here 'twas thou mad'st the Bells of Fancy Chime,</L>

<L>Thou bravest all Mankind with want of Wit.</L>
<L>Nay, in short time, wer't grown so proud a Ninny,</L>
<L>As scarce t'allow that <HI>Ben</HI> himself had any.</L>
<L>But when the Men of Sense thy Error saw,</L>
<L>They check'd thy Muse, and kept the Termagant in awe.</L>

<L>Have we not Cause, in thy own Words, to say,</L>
<L>Let none believe what varies every day,</L>
<L>That never was, nor will be at a stay.</L>

<L>But not, it seems, we greater Heathens now:</L>
<L>The Loyal Church, that buoys the Kingly Line,</L>
<L>Damn'd with a Breath, but 'tis such Breath as thine:</L>
<L>What credit to thy Party can it be,</L>
<L>T' have gain'd so lewd a Profligate as thee?</L>
<L>Stray'd from our Fold, makes us but laugh, not weep;</L>
<L>We have but lost what was disgrace to keep:</L>
<L>By them Mistrusted, and to us a Scorn;</L>
<L>For it is Weakness at the best to turn.</L>
<L>True, hadst thou left us in the former Reign,</L>

<L>Routed by two poor Mice: (Unequal fight)</L>
<L>But easy 'tis to Conquer in the Right.</L>
<L>See there a Youth (a shame to thy gray Hairs)</L>
<L>Make a meer Dunce of all thy threescore Years.</L>

<HEAD>On Melting down the Plate: Or, The Piss|pot's Farewel, <HI>1697.</HI></HEAD>
<L>MAids need no more their Silver Piss-pots scoure,</L>

<L><PB N="216" REF="113">To thee they cringe, and with a straining Face,</L>
<L>They cure their Grief, by opening of their Case.</L>
<L>In times of need thy help they did implore,</L>

<L>Under their Bed thou still had'st been conceal'd,</L>
<L>And ne're but on Necessity reveal'd:</L>
<L>When over charg'd, and in Extremity,</L>
<L>Their dearest Secrets they disclos'd to thee.</L>
<L>Long hast thou been a Prisoner close confin'd,</L>
<L>But Liberty is now for the design'd,</L>
<L>Thou, whom so many Beauties have enjoyed,</L>
<L>Now in another use shall be employ'd;</L>
<L>And with delight be handled ev'ry Day,</L>
<L>And oftner occupied a better way.</L>
<L>But crafty Workmen first must thee refine,</L>
<L>To purge thee from thy Soder and thy Brine.</L>
<L>When thou, transform'd into another shape,</L>
<L>Shalt make the World rejoyce at thy Escape;</L>
<L>And from the Mint in Triumph shalt be sent,</L>
<L>New Coin'd, and Mill'd, to ev'ry Hearts content.</L>
<L>Welcome to all, then proud of thy new Vamp,</L>
<L>Bearing the Pass-port of a royal Stamp;</L>

<HEAD><HI>Tunbridge-Wells.</HI> By the Earl of <HI>Rochester, Iune</HI> 30. 1675.</HEAD>
<L>AT five this Morn, when <HI>Phoebus</HI> rais'd his head</L>
<L>From <HI>Thetis</HI> Lap, I rais'd my self from Bed,</L>
<L>And mounting Steed, I trotted to the Waters,</L>

<L>Cuckolds, Whores, Citizens, their Wives and Daughters</L>
<L>My squemish Stomach, I with Wine had brib'd,</L>

<L>That innocent Provision overthrew,</L>
<L>And without drinking, made me Purge and Spew.</L>
<L>From Coach and Six, a Thing unwealdy roll'd,</L>

<L>But handled, prov'd a meer Sir <HI>Nicholas Cully</HI>;</L>
<L>A Bawling Fop, a <HI>Natural Nokes,</HI> and yet</L>

<L>" For He's a mighty Wit, with those that flatter;</L>
<L>" But a <HI>poor Blockhead,</HI> is a wretched Creature.</L>
<L>Tho' he alone was dismal sight enough,</L>
<L>His Train contributed to set him off;</L>
<L>All of his Shape, all of the self-same Stuff.</L>
<L>No Spleen or Malice, need on them be thrown,</L>
<L>Nature has done the business of Lampoon,</L>

<L>Endeavouring this irksome sight to baulk,</L>
<L>And a more irksome noise, their silly talk;</L>
<L>I silently shrunk down to'th' lower Walk.</L>
<L>But often when we would <HI>Charibdis</HI> shun,</L>
<L>Down upon <HI>Scylla</HI> 'tis our fate to run;</L>
<L>For here it was my cursed luck to find,</L>
<L>As great a Fop, tho' of another kind:</L>
<L>A tall stiff Fool, that walk'd in spanish guise,</L>
<L>The Buckram Puppet never stir'd his Eyes,</L>
<L>But grave as Owlet look'd, as Woodcock wise.</L>
<L>He scorns the empty talk of this mad Age,</L>

<L>As a Cabal can talk of their Intrigues;</L>
<L>Master o'th' Ceremonies, yet can dispence,</L>
<L>With the formality of talking sence.</L>
<L>From hence unto the upper end I ran,</L>
<L>Where a new Scene of Foppery began;</L>
<L>A tribe of Curates, Priests, Canonical Elves,</L>
<L>Were company for none besides themselves:</L>
<L>They got together, each his Distemper told,</L>
<L>Scurvy, Stone, Strangury; and some were bold,</L>
<L><PB N="220" REF="115">To charge the Spleen to be their Misery,</L>
<L>And on that wise Disease bring Infamy.</L>

<L>These call themselves Ambassadors of Heaven,</L>
<L>Saucily pretending a Commission given:</L>

<L>Seldom extends t'above ten miles of Land;</L>
<L>Send forth such wretched Fools on an Embassage,</L>
<L>He'd find but small effect, from such a Message.</L>
<L>Listning, I found the Cobb of all the Rabble,</L>

<L>Was grown so fat, and look'd so big and jolly,</L>
<L>Not being disturb'd with care and melancholly,</L>
<L>Tho' <HI>Marvel</HI> has enough expos'd his folly:</L>
<L>He drank to carry of some old Remains,</L>
<L>His lazy dull Distemper left in's Veins;</L>
<L>Let him drink on, but 'tis not a whole Flood,</L>
<L>Can give sufficient sweetness to his Blood,</L>
<L>Or make his Nature or his Manners good.</L>
<L>Next after these, a fulsom <HI>Irish</HI> Crew,</L>
<L>Of silly Macks were offered to my view;</L>
<L>The Things did talk, but hearing what they said,</L>
<L>I hid my self, the kindness to evade.</L>
<L>Nature has plac'd these Wretches below scorn,</L>
<L>They can't be call'd so vile, as they were born.</L>

<L>Mother and Daughter, Mistress and the Maid,</L>

<L>It is your goodness, and not my deserts,</L>
<L>Which makes you shew your Learning, Wit and Parts.</L>
<L>He puzzled, bites his Nails, both to display</L>

<L>And then more smartly to expound the Riddle</L>
<L>Of all his Prattle, gives her a Scotch Fiddle.</L>

<L>God's and thy Right made thee our Hope before,</L>
<L>And now conjoin'd our happy State restore.</L>
<L>Thy glorious Reign two mighty Works can do,</L>
<L>It <HI>proves</HI> a God, and <HI>represents</HI> him too.</L>
<L>Proud Kings will to thy nobler Style submit,</L>
<L>Only thy Father must above thee sit.</L>
<L>Great King, but greater Man! our Wreaths allow,</L>
<L>Which may imperial by acceptance grow.</L>
<L>Large are the Realms, our Hearts more large, thy hand</L>
<L>May those, but not our boundless Joys, command.</L>
<L>What chearful Beams our rising <HI>Phoebus</HI> crown,</L>
<L>Tho yesterday's in bloody Clouds went down.</L>
<L>One Nation's King, to all a Blessing sent,</L>
<L>His wandring Course through various Nations spent.</L>
<L>While thee their Guest, both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> made,</L>
<L>More Realms, more Tribes thy gentler Beams survey'd.</L>
<L><HI>Nero</HI> our Lord five tedious years would be,</L>
<L>Only that he might prove a foil to thee.</L>
<L>His bloody Reign makes thine delightful all,</L>
<L>As our Red Letters show a Festival.</L>
<L>How smil'd the <HI>Town</HI> when <HI>Charles</HI> his Entrance made,</L>
<L>More great himself than all the Cavalcade.</L>
<L>Then griefless Tears within our Eyes could play,</L>
<L>While <HI>Phoebus</HI> view'd, but never made the Day.</L>
<L><PB N="243" REF="126">Then first drawn Swords from Murders free we view'd</L>
<L>And saw a Conqueror never stain'd with Blood.</L>
<L>When, <HI>Charles,</HI> your Royal Brothers clos'd thy side,</L>
<L>Nature no more could Left and Right decide.</L>
<L>So <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> round their Father move,</L>
<L>And happy their divine Conjunctions prove,</L>
<L>Twelve Labours banish'd <HI>Hercules</HI> sustain'd,</L>
<L>Twelve tedious years great <HI>Charles</HI> in Exile reign'd.</L>
<L>The twelfth is now with lucky <HI>Omens</HI> past,</L>
<L>O may it be of all thy Cares the last.</L>
<L>Vast may thy Empire as thy Wandrings be,</L>
<L>And the wide Globe survey'd submit it self to thee.</L>

<L>IN Dogrel Rhimes we seldom use</L>
<L>To stay for any God or Muse:</L>
<L>But in so nice a case as this</L>
<L>I think it cannot do amiss:</L>
<L>For all the Link-boys round the town,</L>
<L>Have swore, I hear, to run 'em down:</L>
<L>The Men of Tallow, Wieck, and Cotten,</L>
<L>The Tin-men too the Cry have gotten.</L>
<L>Whom, let me see shall we retain?</L>
<L><HI>Phoebus,</HI> for once, shall be the Man.</L>
<L>Great God of Lights! we thee invoke,</L>
<L>If not by t' other side bespoke;</L>
<L>The Stars above, to Men below,</L>
<L>But like your Farthing Candles show:</L>
<L>Whilst thou, with glorious Lustre crown'd,</L>
<L>Dost hang like one of Six i'th' pound:</L>
<L><PB N="244" REF="127">Thou&punc; who'rt all Eye, cast half an one</L>
<L>Down on this <HI>New Invention.</HI></L>
<L>'Tis new indeed to us below,</L>
<L>But known in Heaven long ago.</L>
<L>The Stars in just such Crystal Spheres,</L>
<L>Have burn'd above Five thousand Years;</L>
<L>They fear no Storms by Day or Night,</L>
<L>But thus hang wind and weather tight;</L>
<L>And so they'll hang till Day of Doom,</L>
<L>By that time they'll their Oyl consume:</L>
<L>And then their Glasses breaking round us,</L>
<L>In flames they'll fall and so confound us.</L>
<L>Nay, we can prove the <HI>Milky-way</HI></L>
<L>(For all Sir <HI>Sydrophel</HI> can say)</L>
<L>Is but a Street of some such Lights,</L>
<L>To guide the Heavenly Folks a-nights.</L>
<L>'The Council-chamber up above,</L>
<L>Is hung with such; and <HI>Iove</HI>'s Alcove.</L>
<L>The sacred <HI>Ram</HI> can't furnish horn,</L>
<L>For all the Lights that there are shown:</L>
<L>Horners they've none, and I dare swear</L>
<L>There's ne'er a <HI>Tallow-Chandler</HI> there.</L>
<L><HI>Prometheus</HI> once (that Son of Fame)</L>
<L>Upon a Visit hither came;</L>
<L>And lik'd the thing so wondrous well,</L>
<L>He strait upon the Tryal fell:</L>
<L>But whether (as some Authors say)</L>
<L>The <HI>Tallow-Chandlers</HI> shew'd foul play,</L>
<L>Or Link-boys us'd to break his Glasses,</L>
<L>(For variously the Story passes)</L>
<L>The Project fail'd, and he ran mad,</L>
<L>Such Luck the <HI>Virtuoso</HI> had;</L>
<L>That's all the Bird, the Poets say,</L>
<L>Lies gnawing of him Night and Day.</L>
<L>May more propitious Fates attend</L>
<L>Our present Art-improving Friend!</L>
<L><PB N="245" REF="127">Were this Design but understood,</L>
<L>Twould be of universal Good.</L>
<L>The Stars might go to sleep a-nights,</L>
<L>And leave their work to the <HI>New Lights.</HI></L>
<L>The Midwife-Moon might mind her Calling,</L>
<L>And noisy Light-man leave his Bawling:</L>
<L>Men may pull in their Horns, and be</L>
<L>From <HI>Officers</HI> and <HI>Summons</HI> free.</L>
<L>Nay with such potent Influence</L>
<L>Their streaming Rays they do dispense,</L>
<L>That if the Sun should lie too long,</L>
<L>Here he might have his Bus'ness done:</L>
<L>He might indulge in <HI>Thetis</HI> lap,</L>
<L>And while these burn, take t'other Nap.</L>
<L>Oh! had you been the other Night</L>
<L>In <HI>Cheapside</HI> at th' amazing sight,</L>
<L>Where with their Sawcer Eyes they hung,</L>
<L>And gather'd the admiring throng.</L>
<L>The scatt'ring Light gilt all the gaudy way,</L>
<L>Some People rose and thought it day.</L>
<L>The plying Punks crept into Holes,</L>
<L>Who walk'd the streets before by sholes;</L>
<L>The Night could now no longer skreen</L>
<L>The Tavern-sots from being seen.</L>
<L>The Light-men, they, began to rally,</L>
<L>Who blush'd, and sneak'd down <HI>Grocers-Alley.</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Tempest</HI> you have seen, no doubt,</L>
<L>Just so the Candles all went out;</L>
<L>Those silly tools no more could burn</L>
<L>Than Kitchin-fires before the Sun.</L>
<L>The Quaker, with uplifted Hands,</L>
<L>By <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Nay</HI> the Rogue commends;</L>
<L>Of all their boasted Lights, he said,</L>
<L>These never enter'd once their Head.</L>
<L>When we compare our times with those are past,</L>
<L>We cry, this Age of greater <HI>Light</HI> can boast;</L>
<L><PB N="246" REF="128">I'll say so too, if this Invention hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">,</L>

<L>WHat Fools are they, who use to cry,</L>
<L>Nature's grown crazy, old and dry,</L>
<L>No new Inventions now can boast</L>
<L>For that vast store of old was lost;</L>

<L>O'er Hills and Dales, o'er Floods and Lakes,</L>
<L>Wings at thy Head and at thy Heels,</L>

<L>Sometimes with Baskets, Boxes, Tickets,</L>
<L>Thy Mail is most stuft with Love-pacquets;</L>
<L>The Clouds give way, as thou dost go,</L>

<L>Canst controul the sleepy God,</L>
<L>Vouchsafe to thy poor Foot post Race,</L>
<L>That when the Day's Fatigue is past,</L>
<L>Into sweet Sleep they may be cast.</L>
<L>To give the way let no Man scorn,</L>
<L>Altho they carry ne'er a Horn:</L>
<L>Their Task is greater than the Sun's,</L>
<L>He goes to Bed when he has done,</L>
<L>They only rest an hour at Noon.</L>
<L>As in the Soul of Man we find,</L>
