<P>_AS it is the Ardent prayer of all that love the Lord Iesus in sincerity, that his Kingdome may be enlarged, and the glorious l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ght of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 67. 3. 5.

For the <HI>Shaking</HI> of all Nations maketh way for the com|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hag. 2. 7.</NOTE> of him, who is the <HI>desire</HI> of all Nations. The <HI>wind,</HI> and the <HI>earthquake,</HI> and the <HI>fire</HI> did usher in the <HI>still voyce</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 19. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE> which sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ke unto <HI>Eliah.</HI> When the Spirit came down upon the Apostles. there was <HI>a sound as of a rushing mighty wind,</HI> and the house was shaken, when the people therein <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 2. 2.</NOTE> were to be silled with the holy Ghost.</P>

<P>To the end that God may be glorified, good men&punc; who have already furthered this excellent work, may be comforted, and others excited and provoked to put to their hand unto the advancement thereof, are these papers published, being testi|monies
<PB REF="3">
of the great zeale and care of our Brethren there to promote the Gospell, and of the blessing of God on their la|bours, in the <HI>professed subjection</HI> of many poor soules thereunto.</P>
<P>Two great works we find here further undertaken in or|der to that service.</P>
<P>The one some <HI>helps and directions to the</HI> Indians <HI>how to improve their naturall reason unto the knowledg of the true God.</HI> The reason why there is so short and im|perfect a <HI>specimen</HI> given of it is, because the ships came a|way from <HI>New-England,</HI> before any more of the Copy was wrought off from the presse. It is a work likely to be by the blessing of God of singular use to the natives there, and a ve|ry proper and necessary course for those to take who would convert and perswade <HI>Pagans</HI> to beleeve the Truth.</P>
<P>The Lord was pleased at the first preaching of the <HI>Gospel</HI> to confirme it with <HI>signs and wonders following</HI> for the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 16. 20. Act. 14. 3. Heb. 2. 4.</NOTE> more speedy planting of it by only twelve, and those possibly aged men, in so many places of the world. And how farre he may still bear witnesse thereunto, not only by the holy lives of Christians, but by eminent and remarkable providences, which may tantamount to miracles, I shall not here inquire. But certainly here may be much use made of <HI>naturall rea|son,</HI> to demonstrate unto <HI>Pagans</HI> the falsenesse of the way they are in, and so to prepare a way for entertainment of the Truth. Though the Doctrine of the <HI>Gospel</HI> be <HI>supernatu|rall,</HI> and not investigable by humane disquisition, be<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">ng made <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 2. 9, 10 Gal. 1. 12. Matth. 16. 17.</NOTE> known to men and Angells onely by the <HI>Revelation</HI> of the Holy Spirit: yet when it is revealed, the awakening of <HI>Le|gall impressions</HI> in the <HI>naturall conscience,</HI> will provoke men to attend, &amp; prepare them to entertain it, when it shall be preached unto them.</P>
<P N="1">1. All men have in them a desire of <HI>Happinesse,</HI> and an <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristot. <HI>Ethic.</HI> l. 1 c. 1.</NOTE> aversation from misery.</P>
<P N="2"><PB REF="4">
2. All men more or lesse have some indeleble impressions <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nulla gens est ne&abque; tam immantueta, ne&abque; tam fera, q<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">ae non, eti|amsi ignoret qu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">lem habe re deum dece|at, tamen ha|bendum sciat. <HI>Cicero</HI> de le|gibus, <HI>lib.</HI> 1.

<P N="3">3. There are innate praesensions of the <HI>Immortality</HI> of the soul within it selfe, for <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Pluto</HI> in Phaedro, e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter"> a|pud <HI>Plutarch</HI> consolat ad <HI>Apollon Cicero</HI> de se|nectute. <HI>Senec.

<P N="4">4. There is a natural <GAP DESC="foreign"> or habit of <HI>morall and pra|cticall principles,</HI> and consequently there are naturall im|pressions of guilt and fear upon the conscience, and tacit evi|dences of judgment due unto the workers of iniquity, An <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Iuvenal. Tertull. lib. <HI>de Testimonio a|nimae.</HI></NOTE> heathen Poet could say, <HI>Frigida mens est Criminibus, ta|cit&acirc; sudant praecordia culp&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. There being in all men a naturall desire of <HI>Good,</HI> and a naturall Testimony of Conscience that <HI>God</HI> is the giver of it, so that when evills are upon them which they cannot re|move themselves, they naturally call out for a divine helpe a|bove them to give them deliverance; from hence it cometh to passe, that there are innate apprehensions of some <HI>Religi|on</HI> necessary, in order to the knowledge and service of a <HI>God,</HI> as a requisite <HI>means</HI> to the obtaining of so d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">sireable an <HI>end</HI> as <HI>Happinesse</HI> is.</P>
<P N="6">6. Since it is exactly consonant to right reason, that he to whom service is due, should direct and prescribe the way whereby he will be served (for to serve another is to do that which he willeth to be done:) It is therefore necessary that the way of service and <HI>Religion</HI> be <HI>revealed</HI> unto us from God.</P>
<P N="7">7. Because these premises are indelebly written in the minds of men by nature, Therefore <HI>Satan</HI> not being able, as <HI>Prince of this world</HI> alone, to carry men on in a quiet way <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 12. 31. 16 11.</NOTE> of wickednesse, without some face of <HI>Religion</HI> and worship amongst them, hath invaded the name of a <HI>God,</HI> and made
<PB REF="4">
himselfe <HI>God of this world,</HI> and as a God, hath set up vari|ous wayes of <HI>wicked worship</HI> consistent with his other <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 4. 4.</NOTE> principles and laws of <HI>wicked lusts,</HI> thereby to bind men the faster unto himselfe, <HI>ut fiant mise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">is delicta religiosa,</HI> as <HI>Cyprian</HI> speaks, that men might be tied by their Religion unto wickednesse.</P>
<P>Now the work of <HI>Christ</HI> in the <HI>Gospel</HI> is. 1. As he is <HI>Prince of righteousnesse</HI> to destroy the <HI>lusts</HI> and works of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb 7. 2. 1 J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h 3 8. Rom. 9 5. Act. 14. 15.</NOTE> the Devill. 2. As he is <HI>God blessed for ever,</HI> to abolish the <HI>Idols,</HI> to famish the Gods, and to turne men from vani|ties unto the living God which made heaven and earth.</P>
<P>This to doe, we may in this manner proceed with an hea|then who knows not God. We may convince him by his own naturall and implanted light.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is a <HI>God</HI> who is righteous and holy, who cannot be deceived, will not be mocked.</P>
<P N="2">2. That this God hath implanted in all men a light and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 2. 14, 15</NOTE> <HI>law of nature</HI> by which they are to walk.</P>
<P N="3">3. That he, with whose soul we deale, hath violated that light and law of nature, and is thereby become a <HI>sinner.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 29, 30. 3. 9. Rom. 1. 32.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. That sinne is attended with <HI>guilt</HI> and punishment, &amp; bindeth the sinner over unto <HI>death</HI> and judgment.</P>
<P N="5">5. That there is in him a naturall desire to be delivered from <HI>death</HI> and to be happy.</P>
<P N="6">6. That he is not able by any strength or power of his own to free himselfe from death, or to make himselfe happy.</P>
<P N="7">7. That that way of worship and service which he trusteth in for this deliverance, will never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e able to effect it for him. For the vanity of <HI>Idolatrous</HI> and <HI>Satanicall worship</HI> may by evidence of Reason, and by the inherent characters of im|purity and absurdity within it selfe, be demonstrated. By that way the Lord in Scripture usually doth disprove it. <HI>Deut. 4. 28. Psal. 115. 4, 8. Isa. 41. 24, 28. Isa. 44. 9, 20. Isa. 46. 1. 9. Jer. 10. 3, 11. Habak. 2. 18, 20. Act. 14. 15, 17.
<PB REF="5">
Act 17. 23, 31. Rom. 1. 23, 25.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Being thus brought into straits and extremities, and reduced <HI>ad impossibile</HI> very self-love, awakened by the spi|rit of bondage, will dictate unto a man, when he is convinced of being uttterly out of the way, to inquire <HI>what he shall do to be saved,</HI> and to listen unto that, which is by credible per|sons <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Acts 16. 30.</NOTE> reported to be the right way.</P>
<P N="9">9. Being thus perswaded to look into the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which is represented unto him as the alone way unto salvation. He findeth inherent characters of <HI>purity, Sanctity,</HI> and spiri|tual <HI>beauty</HI> in it. He considereth the <HI>miracles</HI> and <HI>Mar|tyrdomes</HI> whereby it hath been confirmed (which he hath no more reason to distrust then the truth of any other hi|story) He considereth the <HI>prevalency</HI> of it in the world by the ministry of twelve poor men, notwithstanding all the per|secutions which have been from time to time raised against it. He considereth the holy lives of the Professors of it, where|by the wicked lusts which his impure religion alloweth, are shamed and rebuked. He considereth the <HI>nature of it</HI> whol|ly contrary to carnall and secular interests, no way complying with, or giving the least countenance unto any sinful de|lights: so that it is evident that it was not contrived or ob|truded upon men by humane wisdome, or to gratifie any car|nall designe upon these and the like considerations being set on by the finger of the holy Spirit, he is perswaded to beleeve <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 1. 8. Rom. 15. 13. 2 Tim. 1. 12.</NOTE> the Gospel, and by beleeving comes to reape those Ioyes and comforts as make him know whom he hath beleeved.</P>
<P>The other work which is set about in order to the premo|ting of the <HI>Gospel</HI> amongst the poor Indians is the <HI>transla|ting of the Scripture</HI> into their tongue, and Printing it for their use, which as it is a necessary and an excellent worke, and a work of great labour (in consideration whereof the Reverend Translator deserveth great thanks and encourage|ment) so will it be a worke of cost and charges to provide
<PB REF="5">
paper, workmen, and letters for so large a work. And there|fore, as men, when the foundation of a goodly building is go|ing about, will lay a stone with their own hands, to shew some bounty and encouragement to the workmen who are to carry it on; so the laying of this <HI>foundation stone</HI> seemeth to call unto all those whose hearts the Lord hath made willing, to give in their helping hand and chearfull assistance, unto a work tending so immediately to the Salvation of souls and glory of that God, who hath promised, That <HI>they who sow bountifully shall reape bountifully,</HI> who will <HI>multiply their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eed sown, and increase the fruit of their righte|ousnesse.</HI> Certainly if Christ look on the supplies which are given to his poor brethren for their <HI>bodily</HI> reliefe, as given to <HI>himselfe;</HI> much more will he accept and reward the en|deavours of those, who lay out their <HI>bounty,</HI> as he did his <HI>blood,</HI> for the good of mens <HI>souls,</HI> and for the advancement of his kingdome.

<P>_AFter Salutations in the Lord Jesus. I shall not trouble you with any thing at pre|sent save this one businesse of moment, touching the Printing of the Bible in the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, touching which busi|nesse sundry of the Elders did petition unto the Commissioners, moving them to further it, as a principall means of promoting Religion among them. And God so guided (without mans contrivance) that I was there when it came in. They moved this doubt whether the Translation I had made was gene|rally understood? to which I answered, that upon my knowledge it was understood as farre as <HI>Conecticot:</HI> for there I did read some <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Conecticot</HI> is about 100 miles up in the Country.</NOTE> part of my Translation before many hundred English Witnesses, and the <HI>Indians</HI> manifested that they did understand what I read, perfectly, in respect of the language, they further questioned whether I had expressed the Translation in true language? I answered that I feared after times will find many infirmities in it, all humane works are subject to infirmity, yet those pieces that were prin|ted, <HI>viz. Genesis</HI> and <HI>Matthew,</HI> I had sent to such as I thought had best skill in the language, and intreated
<PB N="3" REF="8">
their an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">adversions, but I heard not of any faults they found. When the Commissioners ended their meeting, they did commit the further consideration of this matter to our Commissioners, as I understand, of whom our Governour is president. Therefore at the coming away of this Ship, I repaired to the Gover|nour about it. I proposed this expedient, for the more easie prosecution of this work, <HI>viz.</HI> that your selves might be moved to hire some honest young man, who hath skill to compose, (and the more skill in other parts of the work, the better) send him over as your servant, pay him there to his content, or ingage pay|ment, let him serve you here in <HI>New-England</HI> at the presse in <HI>Harvard</HI> Colledge, and work under the Col|ledg Printer, in impressing the Bible in the <HI>Indian</HI> lan|guage, and with him send a convenient stock of Paper to begin withall. The Governour was pleased to send for M^r <HI>Norton</HI> to advise in it, who came and did heartily further it, whereupon the Governour pro|mised to write unto your selves, and propose the mat|ter, which also I doe, and doe earnestly intreat your assistance herein. And I beseech the Lord to bow your hearts, and incourage you in promoting so good a work, so profitable for the furtherance of Religion, which to further in the best manner, I know is already the bent of your hearts, and your constant prayer and indeavour, and thus committing you, and all your weighty affaires unto the Lord, I rest</P>

<P>_I Have been moved by divers able and godly men here with us to propound unto your pious consideration, whether it be not needful for the better instructi|on of the <HI>Indians</HI> amongst us in the true knowledge of God, to get the whole Bi|ble of the old and new Testament, which is already Translated into the <HI>Indian</HI> tongue, to be printed; Many here with us Divines and others judge it a thing that will be acceptable to God, and very profi|table for the poor Heathens. If your selves doe so esteeme of it too, it will be necessary to provide paper and letters and such things as may further the work, as also a Journey man Printer to be helpefull under M^r <HI>Greene</HI> our Printer to expedite the work. This is only propounded to your serious consideration, which if God please to put into your hearts to further, being so good a work; It will rejoyce the hearts of many godly ones here, and I doubt not of many there also.

named, in a day of fasting and prayer; out of which short notes you may see what life is in the work. The very reason of my gathering up these notes; was be|cause my Sonne (who had not been at a fast among us before) was very much affected with what they deli|vered, so far as he understood them, and when I had communicated these notes to some, they were very well relished, &amp; thereby I was imboldened to present them to your selves, not knowing, but (if the Lord please) thereby you may have more reall informati|on of their state and progresse, then by any thing which were meet for me to say. For my selfe I feele my strength to decay, and I am not able to doe and bear what I have done, and although temptation may sometime breed waverings, yet my soul doth desire &amp; beleeve, that I shall live and dye in the work. And as I have dedicated my sons to serve the Lord in this work (if he please to accept them) so I doe it as they come up; and this yeare my second son having taken his first degree in the Colledge, I presented him also unto our Commissioners, and he is accepted unto the work: which mercy my <HI>soul</HI> doth greatly rejoyce in, and I humbly beg your prayers for them, that the Lord would bow their green spirits unto the worke, and inable them to overlooke the difficultyes and discou|ragements which lye in the way, and thus committing you unto the Lord, and to the guidance of his holy Word, I rest</P>

<P>The Text he spake of was,
<Q><BIBL>Gen. 8. 20, 21.</BIBL>
<P>20. And <HI>Noah</HI> built an Altar unto Iehovah, and took of every clean Beast, and of every clean fowle, and offered burnt offerings on the Altar.</P>
<P>21. And the Lord smelled a sweet Savour; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not againe curse the ground any more for mans sake; for the imaginations of mans heart is evill from his youth, neither will I again smi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e any more every thing living as I have done.</P></Q></P>
<P>A little I shall say, according to that little I know.</P>
<P>_IN that <HI>Noah</HI> sacrificed to God he shewed him|self thankfull; in that he worshiped God, he shewed himselfe godly; in that he sacrificed clean beasts, he shewed that God is an holy God, pure and clean, and all that come to God, and worship him, must be pure and clean: and know that we must by repentance purge our selves, and cleanse our hearts from all sin; which is a work we are to doe this day. In that he sacrificed, it was the manner of worshiping God in old time: but what sacrifices must we offer now? <HI>Answ.</HI> By that <HI>Psal. 4. 5. Offer to God the sacri|fices of righteousnesse, and trust in the Lord.</HI> These are true and spirituall sacrifices which God requireth at our hands. <HI>Sacrifices of Righteousnesse,</HI> that is, we must look to our hearts, and Conversation, that they be righteous, and then we shall be acceptable to God, when we worship him&punc; but if we be unrighteous and unholy, and wicked, we shall not be accepted, our sa|crifices
<PB N="11" REF="12">
are nought. Againe, we must <HI>trust in the Lord:</HI> for who else should we trust in, we must believe in the word of God; for if we doubt of God, and doubt of his word, then our sacrifices are little worth; but if we trust stedfastly in the Lord then our sacrifices are good. Again, what kind of sacrifices must we offer? <HI>Answ.</HI> We must offer such as <HI>Abraham</HI> offered; and what sacrifice did he offer. <HI>Answ.</HI> see <HI>Gen. 22. 12. Now I know that thou fearest me, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thy only son from me;</HI> he had but one dearly beloved son, and he offered him to God; &amp; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">n God saith, <HI>I know thou fearest me, because thou hast not withheld thy son:</HI> This was to sacrifice indeed and in truth; so we must sacrifice indeed, and in truth, but God doth not require us to sacrifice our sons, but our beloved sins, our dearest sins: God calleth us this day to part with all our sins, though never so beloved, and we must not withhold any of them from him: if we will not part with all, it is not a right sacrifice: we must part with those sins we love best, and then we offer a good sacrifice. Again, God smelt a sweet sa|vour in <HI>Noahs</HI> sacrifice, &amp; so when we offer such wor|ship to God as is cleane, and pure, and sacrifice as <HI>A|braham</HI> did, then God accepts our sacrifice. Again, God manifested his acceptance of <HI>Noahs</HI> sacrifice, by pro|mising to drown the world no more, but gave him fruitfull times and seasons. God hath chastized us of late with such raines, as if he would drown us, and he hath drowned and spoiled a great deale of hay, and threatens to kill our Cattel, and for this we fast and pray this day; now if we offer a spirituall sacrifice, clean and pure as <HI>Noah</HI> did, then God will smell a sa|vour of rest in us, as he did in <HI>Noah,</HI> and then he will withhold the Rain, and give us fruitfull seasons.</P>

<P>A little I'le speak, according to that poor little I know</P>
<P>_THe Doctrine that Christ teacheth us in these words, is the Doctrine of fasting and prayer; and the duty we doe this day, is to practice this Doctrine, for God calleth us this day to fasting and prayer. There be many causes of prayer to God this day; as to prepare our hearts for Church, covenant, and Ordinances, and to pray for the taking away our sicknesse, and these great rains [here he did enumerate sundry causes of seeking God] But why must we fast? <HI>Answ.</HI> That we might the more effect|ually mourn for sin. If any of you bury a child or a friend, then you will mourn, and fast too, for if we of|fer you meat, you will refuse it, yea you cannot eat, be|cause your heart is so full of sorrow: no matter for meat then, your tears, and sighs, and sorrows fill you
<PB N="13" REF="13">
so, that you cannot eat; so that fasting is an help to mourning. Now this day is a day of mourning, and what doe we mourn for? not for a child or a friend, but a greater matter; we must mourn for our sins, and we should be so filled, and possessed with mourning for our si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s, that we should forget hunger, ye so afflicted in our hearts, that we cannot eat though it should be offfered to us: our hearts should be so full of sorrow, that we cannot be an hungry nor eat. Againe we fast that we might repent of our sins, and amend our lives, according to that <HI>Matth. 3. 8. bring forth therefore fruits meet for Repentance.</HI> This is a day of Repentance, we must therefore fast this day, so as becometh Repen|tance, therefore we must confesse our sins, and we must mourn for our sins, and we must forsake our sins, for these are works meet for Repentance. Again, <HI>we must not be like hypocrites in our fasting, for they disfigure their faces,</HI> and seem to men as if they mourned and fasted, and repented, but in their hearts they doe not so, and therefore God who knoweth what is in the heart, and seeth in secret, he doth know their hypocrisie, and so he knoweth our hypocrisie, if we come here, and ap|pear to man as if we fasted, and yet in our hearts we fast not, if we do not mourn and repent for sin, we do not fast, God doth not account that to be a fast. Again, such as fast an hypocritical fast, they shall be sure to be rewarded, and what reward will God give to such as fast like hypocrites? I answer, that you may see what the wages of hypocrites is, <HI>Mat. 24, 51. shall cut him a|sunder, &amp; appoynt him his portion with the hypocrites, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,</HI> and this is evill wa|ges: and therefore let us be moved, to keep a right fast this day, by repenting of our sins, and amending of our lives, and then the Lord will reward us openly, if he see that our hearts are right before him.</P>

<P>A little I will say, for I can say but little, for I am weak and know but little.</P>
<P>_THis is a Parable, as when young people are at a wedding, there is feasting, and joy, and mirth, but no sorrow, nor mour|ning, nor weeping: So when Christ is with his people, he brings joy and com|fort with him, and fills their hearts with comfort: but if he be angry, and depart from his peo|ple, and leave them to afflictions, then there is sorrow, and mourning, and weeping, and fasting, as it is this day with us; for we are called to fasting this day, because of the great raine, and great floods, and unsea|sonable weather, whereby the Lord spoileth our la|bours: our corne is much spoiled with the wet: so that the Lord doth threaten us with want of food; also our hay is much spoiled, so that God threatneth
<PB N="15" REF="14">
to starve and kill our Cattel: also we have great sick|nesse among us; so that many are dead: the burying place of this Town hath many graves, and so it is in all our Towns among the praying <HI>Indians.</HI> Also in our houses are many sick, and a great many are crazy, and weak, and not well; God threatneth to kill us, and therefore surely he is angry, and what maketh him an|gry? we may be sure it is our sins, for we are great sin|ners. This day is therefore a day of Repentance, of fasting, and of mourning. And what are we to doe in this day of fasting? <HI>Answ.</HI> We must search out all our sins, and with hearty Repentance forsake them. And when we goe about to search out our fins, we must remember that there be three places where we must search for sin: First, in our hearts; Secondly, in our words; 3ly, in our works and doings, and in all these places we find too many, but especially in our hearts; for there be evill thoughts, and the root sin [that is to say Originall sin, for so we call it in their language] and therefore it is a great work to search our hearts, &amp; find out the roots of sin: and if any doe say it is an hard work, and I know not how to doe it: I answer, it is true, it is hard work, but therefore we must take so much the more paines, and care to doe it, as we doe about hard works. If any say I cannot tell how to find out my sins: I answer, we must this day pray unto the Lord to help us to find them out, and to forsake them, for he knoweth them all.</P>
<P>Againe, another cause of our fasting this day, is to prepare us to make a church of Christ among us: and if you say what must we doe to prepare for Church|estate. I answer we must repent of our sin, and make our selves clean, we must get cleannesse of heart, when we come neer unto God, according to that <HI>Mat.</HI> 3. 2.
<PB N="16" REF="14">
<HI>Repent for the Kingdome of heaven is at hand.</HI></P>
<P>Againe, to prepare us for church estate, we must pray unto God, to send his Spirit into our hearts, be|cause the Spirit of God will convert us, and purge our hearts, and sanctifie us, and teach us to pray, and com|fort us, and will never leave us, till he have brought us to the Kingdome of heaven (as you know we are taught in our catechisme) And it is the gift of God to send his Spirit into our hearts, and Christ hath pro|mised to doe it for us, as the word of God speaketh, <HI>Mat. 3. 11. I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier then I, whose shooes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the holy ghost, and with fire.</HI> Where we see that <HI>Iohn</HI> did baptize them with water, but Christ doth baptize them with the holy ghost &amp; fire; we desire to be baptized by man, and man baptizeth with water, and that is a sign of Repentance; but we must look for the baptisme of Christ, &amp; he giveth us his Spirit, that is his baptizing. And when Christ baptizeth with his Spirit that doth more then water can doe, for the Spirit doth purge our soules, and maketh our hearts pure and clean.</P>
<P>Again, he baptizeth with fire, what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> that? I <HI>Ans.</HI> not outward fire, but spirituall, and it is a similitude, thus: what will fire doe? I answer, you all know what fire will do; for when your Tobacco-pipes are filthy, foule, stinking, unfit for your use, you cast them into the fire, and that doth not burn them up, but burneth up all their filth, and maketh them clean and sweet, &amp; fit for your use. So our hearts are filthy, and unfit for Gods use, but cast our hearts into the word, for there the Spirit is, and then the Spirit of God will burn out all our filth and sin, and make us sweet, and fit for the Lords use.</P>

Words of two sillables most frequently be not accented at all, being commonly of equal measure, and hardly mispronounced. Also, sundry times the prepositions in, with, for from by, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be set after the Substantives in the <HI>Indian</HI> and before them in the <HI>English,</HI> that so no harsh|nesse (this caution remembred) may sound in either.</P>
<P>Likewise sometime a phrase is used in the <HI>Indian,</HI> which word for word can hardly be rendred in the <HI>English;</HI> but then, and ever, care is had that in every sentence, and with|in the limits of every stop, the <HI>Indian</HI> doth truly answer the <HI>English.</HI> The Lord pardon, accept, and give successe, that this may be an help towards the spiritual good of <HI>Indian|souls.</HI></P>

<P>THese are to testifie to all men to whom these pre|sents may come, that two of the <HI>Indians</HI> that are trained up at the Grammer-Schoole in <HI>Cambridge</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> whose names were <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Ioel,</HI> were called forth upon tryall at the publick Commence|ment before the Magistrates and Elders, and in the face of the Country, and thereupon very little warn|ing gave good contentment (for their time) to them that were present, being examined by the Praesident of the Colledge in turning a part of a Chapter in <HI>Isaiah</HI> into Latine, and shewing the construction of it so that they gave great hope for the future of their perfecting.
