<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TH&ocirc; some Disputes are made Needful by needless Questions which are raised by <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2. 14.</NOTE> <HI>strife of Words;</HI> and th&ocirc; when Malice, or Curiosity, Carnal Interest, or Ambition, have brew'd and broach|ed such Doctrines, as are dishonourable to God, and his holy Gospel, or have a Ten|dency to the Ruin of Church and State, The
<PB REF="3">
<HI>greatest Lovers of Peace and Silence</HI> must so dispute against the Former, as by their Ar|guments to assert and secure the Later; Th&ocirc; the most peaceable Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Iohannes Ox|on <HI>in vit&acirc;</HI> H.

<P>Experience tells us 'tis often easier, by Obstinate Silence to <HI>prevent,</HI> than by Reason to <HI>confute,</HI> or to <HI>shame</HI> an Error. And next to such a Resolved Silence, I know not any better Preventive of needless Controver|sies and Questions, than our Medit<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="bleedthrough" EXTENT="2 letters">ing on Questions which are <HI>not needless;</HI> But of great Consequence to be asked, and of greater Necessity to be Answered. And such as to which <HI>we ought to give our selves</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 4. 15.</NOTE> <HI>whol|ly.</HI> As <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Acts 16. 30.</NOTE> <HI>what we must do that we</HI>
<PB REF="3">
<HI>may be sav'd?</HI> What is the certain <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Matth. 7. 16, 19, 20, 21. Mark 16. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Di|agnostick</HI> whereby to judge without Sin of our selves, and others? and as well of our present, as future state? What is that we call The Gospel? and wherein especially does It consist? What is it <HI>to be able to</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Eph. 3. 18, 19.</NOTE> <HI>com|prehend with all Saints, the Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Highth, and so to know the Love of Christ which passeth Knowledge?</HI> to know the <HI>Immensi|ty</HI> of his Love, expressed to us (as by an Emblem,) by all the <HI>Dimensions</HI> of the <HI>Cross</HI> he was fastned to; Extended <HI>upwards,</HI> and <HI>downwards,</HI> and on <HI>Both</HI> the <HI>sides</HI> of it; a Type of the <HI>Fathomless</HI> love of Christ, whereof the Knowledge is supereminent, sur|passing and transcending All <HI>other</HI> knowledges in the World. In so much that we may fit|ly espouse our Apostles Resolution, <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 2. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Not to know any thing in comparison of Je|sus Christ, and Him Crucified;</HI> whereby is pithily represented The Law and Equity of The Gospel, which is the Summ of All the Theology a Faithful Steward needs Preach, to|wards <NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 4. 16.</NOTE> <HI>the Saving of himself, and of Them that hear him.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="4">And as in the Days of our Forefathers, when <HI>Christian Simplicity</HI> was at its purest, <HI>A vitious Life</HI> was justly reckon'd, not only the <HI>greatest,</HI> but the <HI>worst Haeresie</HI> in the World; So of Convictions, and Confutations, <HI>Reli|gious Practices</HI> were the most <HI>Cogent.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> (as St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> some|where calls them,) Convincing Syllogisms and Arguments, not to be <HI>answer'd</HI> by the <HI>A|cutest,</HI> nor ever heartily <HI>gainsaid</HI> by the <HI>worst</HI> of men. And therefore as Controvert|ed Doctrines have taken up much of my Time pass't, so These (I am sure) are the <HI>Grand Requisites,</HI> which 'twill be better to advance for the Time to come.</P>
<P>I easily guess what will happen, to me and others of the Old Stamp, (the envied Friends and Disciples of Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI>) whilst we ingage in This Course of Preaching up <HI>Christ as a Legislator;</HI> and of celebra|ting The <HI>Law,</HI> as well as the <HI>Equity</HI> of The Gospel; of walking evenly in our Doctrines 'twixt two Extremes; to wit <HI>Socinians</HI> on the one side, and <HI>Solifidians</HI> on the other. Even the same that befell the Antient Fa|thers of the Church; who for distinguishing
<PB REF="4">
the <HI>Persons</HI> or <HI>Subsistences</HI> of the Deity, were called <HI>Tritheites</HI> and <HI>Arians</HI> by the Followers of <HI>Sabellius;</HI> and yet were called <HI>Sabellians</HI> too, both by the <HI>Tritheites</HI> and the <HI>Arians,</HI> for not dividing the very <HI>Sub|stance,</HI> or the Deity it self. So for teach|ing that our <HI>Saviour</HI> did consist of <HI>two Na|tures,</HI> they were branded as <HI>Nestorians</HI> by the whole Sect of the <HI>Eutychians;</HI> and yet were stiled <HI>Eutychians</HI> too by all the Gang of the <HI>Nestorians,</HI> for asserting that our Savi|our was no more than <HI>one Person.</HI> After the very same manner; We, for holding the <HI>Necessity of impartial Obedience</HI> to Christ's Commands, and (by consequence unavoidable) <HI>a Necessity of Good Works,</HI> as Part of the <HI>means</HI> of our being <HI>saved,</HI> do commonly pass for <HI>Socinians</HI> in the Rash Censure of <HI>Solifidians;</HI> and yet are accompted <HI>Solifidi|ans</HI> by the like Rashness of the <HI>Socinians,</HI> for our <HI>disclaiming</HI> All Merit in our <HI>Obedi|ence</HI> and <HI>Good Works,</HI> as to the making <HI>Satisfaction</HI> to the <HI>Justice</HI> of God for our Transgressions; and for desiring with St. <HI>Paul, To be found only in Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip. 3. 9.</NOTE> <HI>not having our own Righteousness,</HI>
<PB REF="5" MS="y">
<HI>But That which is of God by Faith.</HI></P>
<P>But we must not be afraid to assert and propagate <HI>The Truth,</HI> because there are who infer it from diverse <HI>Falshoods;</HI> Nor may we dishonestly <HI>let it go,</HI> for other mens hold|ing <HI>it in unrighteousness.</HI> For for <HI>us</HI> to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 18.</NOTE> deny our <HI>Obligation</HI> to Good Works, because there are who do contend for the <HI>Merit</HI> of them; or for <HI>us</HI> not to own the perfect <HI>Ne|cessity</HI> of Obedience, which does naturally tend to the <HI>Glory</HI> of God, because <HI>Socini|ans</HI> own the same to his great <HI>Dishonour;</HI> or for <HI>us</HI> not to infer it from the <HI>Divinity</HI> of our Saviour, (as well as from the Perfe|ction both of his <HI>Covenant</HI> and his <HI>Com|mands,</HI>) because such Haereticks do infer it from their <HI>Denial</HI> of His Divinity, and of his Plenary <HI>Satisfaction</HI> for the Sins of the World; is just as bad as if <HI>the Christians</HI> should now begin to dogmatize, That there are <HI>Three distinct Gods,</HI> (the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,) because <HI>The Jews</HI> and <HI>The Mahomedans</HI> do constantly hold there is <HI>but ONE.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="5">I shall therefore so order the following Parts of my Design, betwixt the <HI>Enemies</HI> of <HI>Truth</HI> upon <HI>either side,</HI> as to hazard the displeasure of <HI>both Extreams.</HI> But yet be|cause I am convinc'd by the best Searches I can make, That the preaching up of <HI>Faith</HI> in its <HI>vulgar Notions,</HI> hath been generally the <HI>Cause</HI> of such a <HI>Carnal Security,</HI> as hath <HI>shrunk up</HI> those Sinews of <HI>Vertuous Living,</HI> wherein the strength of <HI>Religion</HI> doth chief|ly stand; and that Men are made <HI>Infidels</HI> (not to say <HI>Atheists</HI>) in their <HI>practice,</HI> by no means more, than by their <HI>Errours</HI> a|bout the <HI>Nature</HI> and the great <HI>Privilege</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and so of their <HI>Belief in the Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> I shall give such a <HI>By|ass</HI> to my ensuing Meditations, as may in|cline them most strongly to the Advantages of <HI>Obedience,</HI> and <HI>strict Converse.</HI> Whe|ther by solving such <HI>Objections,</HI> as still remain to be Consider'd; or by the clear|ing of such Scriptures, as men have <HI>Ap|petites</HI> to <HI>obscure;</HI> or by shewing the <HI>A|greement,</HI> of such as may seem to <HI>contra|dict,</HI> or else by pointing at such <HI>Instru|ctions,</HI> as all the <HI>Premisses</HI> put to|gether
<PB REF="6">
shall chance to <HI>yield</HI> us.</P>
<P>And this I shall do, if God permit up|on some future Opportunities; if This I pre|sently lay hold on shall prove as worthy of Acceptation, as by Me it is well-intended. That it may, I think fit to premise before|hand This Declaration: That if in any Thing I have spoken, I seem to have spoken some|what Austerely; I have not done it with any particular Reflections, upon any man's Per|son, alive, or dead. My Propositions are <HI>Universal,</HI> as well as <HI>True;</HI> and my Seve|rities to the Guilty lye All in common. As many as find themselves concern'd, may make their <HI>personal</HI> and their <HI>private</HI> Applicati|ons of my Reproofs; so as they carry it in their Memories, that I have <HI>made None at all.</HI> For the longer I live, the more I am of this Opinion, that <HI>Truth</HI> it self may be <HI>asserted,</HI> and <HI>Questions</HI> about it <HI>deci|ded</HI> also, without reflecting upon the <HI>Per|sons</HI> (th&ocirc; we <HI>must</HI> intimate the <HI>Parties</HI>) from whom we differ.</P>
<P>And here I am tempted to <HI>take</HI> Occasion (where None is <HI>offer'd</HI>) to tell my Reader for his Service, (if I can rightly apprehend
<PB REF="6">
it,) that when I am now and then consulted by a young Student in Divinity, and a Candidate for the Priesthood, what kind of <HI>Cynosure</HI> he shall <HI>steer by,</HI> when he is newly launching forth in the vast Ocean of Theology; I do not <HI>presently</HI> direct him, (as Dr. <HI>Steward</HI> at St. <HI>Germans</HI> directed <HI>Me,</HI>) to begin with <HI>Vincentius Lirinensis;</HI> to <HI>proceed</HI> with <HI>Baronius</HI> and The <HI>Magdebur|genses;</HI> Then with the Fathers of the Church for the first Three hundred years; Nor do I <HI>presently</HI> ingage him in the Learned and E|laborate and laudable Method of Mr. <HI>Dod|well,</HI> whose Parts, and Piety, his Patience, and his Pains-taking, many Theologues may imitate, but few can equal; But first I tell him, that the shortest and surest way, whereby to make himself a sufficient and sound Divine, is (next to his reading and revol|ving the <HI>Word of God,</HI>) to study the Works of Dr. <HI>Hammond;</HI> beginning with his <HI>Annotations,</HI> at least with his <HI>Paraphrase</HI> on the <HI>New Testament,</HI> His <HI>Practical Ca|techism,</HI> and His Book <HI>of Fundamentals.</HI> For I have been long of this Opinion; that He whose important Office it is, to be a Lea|der
<PB REF="7">
of other men in the Way of Truth, and either not at all to err, or else to err as inoffensively, as 'tis possible for him to do in a state of Frailty, will find it Safest to be a <HI>Follower</HI> of the most Excellent Dr. <HI>Ham|mond,</HI> who (if any man ever was) was a Circumspect <HI>Follower</HI> of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> To whom be Glory for ever and ever.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOHN XIII. 13.</BIBL>
<Q>Ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>&sect; 1. THat we may see how well the Text may be made suitable to the Time, both to the <HI>Day</HI> of the <HI>Month,</HI> and to the <HI>Buis'ness</HI> of the <HI>Day,</HI> we shall do well do bear in mind, throughout the Tenor of my Discourse, that our Saviour's last Supper did consist of two
<PB N="2" REF="9">
parts. There was a <HI>Coena,</HI> and a <HI>Post-Coenium:</HI> which we may fitly enough express, by cal|ling them the <HI>first,</HI> and the <HI>second Course.</HI> Our Saviour rose from the <HI>first,</HI> to <HI>wash</HI> and <HI>wipe his Disciples Feet,</HI> (v. 5.) which as soon as he had done, he sat him down unto the <HI>second,</HI> (v. 12.) And then designing to insti|tute the <HI>tremendous Sacrament</HI> of his <HI>Body,</HI> he prepared his <HI>Communicants</HI> with these words following, (v. 13.) <HI>Ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am.</HI></P>
<P>The word <HI>Lord,</HI> and the word <HI>Master</HI> do so <HI>agree</HI> in the <HI>Translation,</HI> and yet in the Original do so much differ, that we must bring in the <HI>Greek</HI> to explain the <HI>English,</HI> or else we shall miss of its full Importance.</P>
<P>&sect; 2. <GAP DESC="foreign"> is a word which refers to <HI>Pow|er.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> a word which relates to <HI>Know|ledge.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> is from <GAP DESC="foreign">, which properly signifies <HI>Authority;</HI> but <GAP DESC="foreign"> from <GAP DESC="foreign">, which properly signifies <HI>to Teach.</HI> Our blessed Saviour is the <HI>first</HI> in his <HI>Kingly</HI> Of|fice, and the <HI>second</HI> in his <HI>Prophetical.</HI> He is [<GAP DESC="foreign">] a <HI>Lord,</HI> to <HI>protect</HI> and <HI>govern;</HI> He is [<GAP DESC="foreign">] a <HI>Master,</HI> to <HI>direct</HI> and <HI>teach</HI> us; And <HI>Both</HI> he is <GAP DESC="foreign">, in such a degree of <HI>supereminence,</HI> as is not common to <HI>him</HI> with
<PB N="3" REF="9" MS="y">
others; <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>THE Lord,</HI> and <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>THE Master.</HI> In as much as he is <HI>the Lord,</HI> we are to <HI>serve</HI> in his <HI>House;</HI> And in as much as he is <HI>the Master,</HI> we are to <HI>learn</HI> in his <HI>School.</HI> He is <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>the Lord,</HI> to stretch his <HI>Scepter</HI> over our <HI>Hearts;</HI> And <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>the Master,</HI> to light his <HI>Candle</HI> within our <HI>Heads.</HI> As a <HI>Master,</HI> he <HI>instructs</HI> us to <HI>know</HI> our Du|ties; but as a <HI>Lord,</HI> he commands us to <HI>do</HI> them also. He is proposed to us as <HI>Both,</HI> for our <HI>Observance</HI> and <HI>Imitation.</HI> That <HI>looking on him</HI> as our <HI>Lord,</HI> we may be <HI>humble;</HI> and <HI>taking after</HI> him as our <HI>Master,</HI> we may be <HI>wise.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. And this which helps us to <HI>Under|stand,</HI> may help us also to <HI>divide,</HI> and <HI>apply</HI> the Text. For</P>
<P>First of all, If he is <GAP DESC="foreign">, which proper|ly signifies a <HI>Lord,</HI> whose Prerogative it is to <HI>Command</HI> and <HI>Rule</HI> us; then must we pay him a strict <HI>obedience,</HI> in as much as we are his <HI>Subjects,</HI> or as being his <HI>Soldiers,</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI> too. (Such as promised in our Baptism to <HI>fight manfully under his Banner.</HI>)</P>
<P>Secondly, If he is <GAP DESC="foreign">, which pro|perly signifies a <HI>Master,</HI> whose property it is to <HI>instruct</HI> and <HI>teach</HI> us; then do we owe him
<PB N="4" REF="10">
<HI>obedience</HI> too, as being his <HI>Followers</HI> and <HI>Dis|ciples,</HI> placed under his <HI>Discipline,</HI> and trained up in his <HI>School.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, It follows by way of <HI>Inference</HI> from two expressions in the Text, (towit the <HI>first,</HI> and the <HI>last,</HI>) that he is not only to be <HI>called</HI> our Lord and Master, but to be serious|ly <HI>received</HI> and own'd as <HI>such.</HI> For mark the manner in which he speaks.</P>
<P>Ye <HI>call</HI> me <HI>Lord,</HI> and ye <HI>call</HI> me <HI>Master;</HI> and in that ye <HI>say well,</HI> because what ye <HI>call</HI> me, I truly <HI>am.</HI> But to <HI>say</HI> well, is <HI>one</HI> thing; and to <HI>do</HI> well, <HI>another.</HI> And therefore be|cause I truly <HI>am</HI> what ye <HI>call</HI> me, <HI>be</HI> you as truly what you <HI>pretend.</HI> If I your <HI>Lord</HI> and your <HI>Master</HI> have washed <HI>your</HI> feet, re|member then to <HI>do as ye have me for an Ex|ample,</HI> and see that ye wash <HI>oneanothers</HI> feet. If they have called <HI>me</HI> Belzebub, who am the <HI>Master</HI> of the <HI>House;</HI> how much more should such as <HI>You</HI> (who are but some of my <HI>Houshold</HI>) be content to be called as <HI>bad,</HI> or <HI>worse?</HI></P>
<P>In the two <HI>first</HI> of these Particulars we have the <HI>Doctrin</HI> of the Text; and in the last we see the <HI>Use.</HI> Not an Use of my framing, but such as the <HI>Author</HI> of the Text was pleas'd
<PB N="5" REF="10">
himself to draw <HI>from</HI> it for our Instruction.</P>
<P>&sect; 4. The <HI>Result</HI> of the <HI>Doctrin</HI> is briefly <HI>this.</HI> That we must not expect to live as <HI>Li|bertines</HI> under <HI>Christ,</HI> who is not only our <HI>Elder Brother,</HI> to make us <HI>partakers</HI> of his <HI>In|heritance;</HI> but our <HI>Lord</HI> and our <HI>Master,</HI> to make us <HI>obedient</HI> to his <HI>Commands.</HI> Not our <HI>Lord</HI> only to <HI>Save</HI> us, but especially our <HI>Lord</HI> to be <HI>served</HI> by us. Nor our <HI>Master</HI> only to <HI>teach</HI> us by the <HI>Veracity</HI> of his <HI>Doctrin,</HI> but more especially to <HI>reform</HI> us by the <HI>convin|cingness</HI> of his <HI>Life.</HI> Our <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Master</HI> in the <HI>Text</HI> hath such a <HI>twofold</HI> Importance, as comes to one and the same <HI>end</HI> in the <HI>Ap|plication.</HI> We may <HI>distinguish</HI> the Notions, but must not <HI>separate</HI> or <HI>divide</HI> them. They must be <HI>coupled</HI> in my <HI>Discourse,</HI> as here they are in the <HI>Subject</HI> of it.

<P>&sect; 2. Our Translation, however True, is so far short of the Original, that (as be|fore, so now also,) the Greek must come in to assist the English, or else we shall miss of its whole Importance. For 'tis not only <HI>my Yoke is Easy,</HI> But <GAP DESC="foreign">, my Yoke is <HI>Good.</HI> My Yoke is <HI>profitable</HI> and <HI>useful.</HI> My Yoke is an <HI>indearing</HI> and <HI>delectable</HI> Yoke. For all this and more is imported by the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, as Lexicographers and Glossa|ries do make apparent. That is, (to express it without a Metaphor) The Service of Christ is a most gratious, and Desirable Service. What he commands us to perform, is not only very possible, but facil and easy to be perform'd. Nor only so, but sweet and pleasant in the performance. It is not only our Bounden <HI>Duty,</HI> but 'tis our <HI>Interest,</HI> our <HI>Delight,</HI> our <HI>Reward</HI> to serve him.</P>
<P>&sect; 3. And such as the <HI>Yoke</HI> is with which he <HI>binds,</HI> such is also the <HI>burden</HI> wherewith
<PB N="40" REF="28">
he <HI>loads</HI> us. Whatsoever his <HI>Burden</HI> may here import. If the <HI>Burden</HI> of his <HI>Precepts,</HI> then 'tis <HI>absolutely</HI> light. For then the <HI>Bur|den</HI> and the <HI>Yoke</HI> are Terms <HI>aequivalent.</HI> The <HI>lightness</HI> of the <HI>one</HI> explains the <HI>Easiness</HI> of the <HI>other;</HI> and the later clause of the Text is but an <HI>Exegesis</HI> of the <HI>former.</HI> Or admit that by his <HI>Burden</HI> is meant the <HI>Bur|den</HI> of his <HI>Cross;</HI> yet even <HI>then</HI> we must confess it is <HI>comparatively</HI> light. And so in|deed it is in two considerable respects. First in respect of the <HI>endless punishment,</HI> which will fall upon Them that <HI>refuse</HI> the Burden; and again in respect of that <HI>unspeakable Re|ward,</HI> which will be given unto them that shall <HI>take it up.</HI> The <HI>Cross</HI> of Christ at its <HI>heaviest</HI> is but a <HI>Burden</HI> of <HI>Afflictions,</HI> which St. <HI>Paul</HI> accompts <HI>light</HI> for these two reasons. First because <HI>it is but for a moment;</HI> next be|cause <HI>it works for us a far more exceeding and</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 4. 17.</NOTE> <HI>eternal weight of glory.</HI> For as the same A|postle saith to the same <HI>Corinthians,</HI> (what seems at first hearing a contradiction,) <GAP DESC="foreign">, that <HI>That which was glorious was not glorious at all, in respect of the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 3. 10.</NOTE> <HI>glory which excelleth.</HI> So 'tis as true That
<PB N="41" REF="28">
<HI>our Afflictions are no Afflictions, in comparison with the Beatitudes which they work for us as our Reward.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 4. This is the meaning of the Text consider'd simply in it self. Wherein are two Things especially which offer them|selves to our <HI>Consideration.</HI></P>
<P>First the <HI>Greatness</HI> of Christ in the <HI>Extent</HI> of his Authority; and</P>
<P>Secondly his <HI>Goodness,</HI> in the merciful <HI>use</HI> or <HI>employment</HI> of it.</P>
<P>First his <HI>Greatness</HI> is very evident, in that he has the power to impose a <HI>Yoke,</HI> and a <HI>Burden.</HI> A <HI>Yoke</HI> of <HI>Injunctions</HI> upon our <HI>Necks,</HI> and a Burden of <HI>Suffrings</HI> upon our <HI>Backs.</HI></P>
<P>Next his <HI>Goodness</HI> is as apparent, from the <HI>easiness</HI> of the one, and from the <HI>lightness</HI> of the other. For besides That <HI>Eternal and exceeding weight of Glory,</HI> which gives an <HI>easiness</HI> to the <HI>Yoke,</HI> however <HI>hard;</HI> and a <HI>lightness</HI> to the <HI>Burden,</HI> however <HI>heavy;</HI> The one is so <HI>easy</HI> in <HI>it self,</HI> and the other in <HI>it self</HI> is so truly <HI>light,</HI> (considering that <HI>dolor, si gravis, brevis,</HI> is just as much, as <HI>si longus, le|vis,</HI>) that even the <HI>Yoke</HI> of his <HI>Injunctions</HI> does
<PB N="42" REF="29">
give us <HI>Freedom,</HI> and the <HI>Burden</HI> of his <HI>Suf|frings</HI> affords us <HI>strength.</HI></P>
<P>If we put them both together, they make a Text without length extremely copious; for it exhibits to us at once the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>E|quity</HI> of the Gospel. The <HI>Yoke</HI> and the <HI>Bur|den</HI> do prove the first, as the easiness and the <HI>lightness</HI> infer the second. It serves to keep us in the <HI>Fear,</HI> and the <HI>Faith</HI> of Christ. For first the nature of a <HI>Yoke</HI> implies a Bridle to our <HI>Presumption;</HI> and then the <HI>easiness</HI> of <HI>this</HI> Yoke does also forbid us to <HI>despair.</HI> Christ is here both in his <HI>Kingly,</HI> and <HI>Priestly</HI> Office; at once to <HI>rule,</HI> and to <HI>bless</HI> us too. He is an <HI>Absolute</HI> Soveraign, because to <HI>Him</HI> it does belong to put a <HI>Yoke</HI> upon our <HI>Necks,</HI> But yet withal he is a <HI>good</HI> and a <HI>Gratious</HI> So|veraign, because It is not only <HI>easy,</HI> but gives us <HI>ease</HI> too. And though it may some|times <HI>vex</HI> the <HI>Body,</HI> yet it brings <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Vers. 29.</NOTE> <HI>Rest unto the Soul.</HI></P>
<P>The Reason of which is wrapt up in the causal <HI>For,</HI> being consider'd in its <HI>Retrospect</HI> on the Verse going before. Where no sooner had he said, <HI>Take my Yoke, and ye shall find rest;</HI> but immediatly it follows,
<PB N="43" REF="29">
<HI>For,</HI> or <HI>Because</HI> my Yoke is easy. And this again affords us a <HI>double Reason,</HI> for which we should <HI>come</HI> at his <HI>Invitation,</HI> (v. 28.) First because my <HI>Yoke</HI> is <HI>easy,</HI> Therefore <HI>come un|to me;</HI> Next because it is so <HI>gratious</HI> as to give <HI>Rest unto your Souls,</HI> Therefore <HI>come unto me all ye that labour.</HI> And this is the meaning of the Text in its relation to the Context.</P>
<P>&sect; 5. To Contract my meditations with|in the compass of the time, and withal to go forwards with the design I have in hand, (which is not only to shew the <HI>Law,</HI> but also the <HI>Equity</HI> of the Gospel,) I must not <HI>now</HI> consider Christ in the <HI>extent</HI> of his <HI>Authority,</HI> as he is <GAP DESC="foreign">, (that is to say) an <HI>Absolute unaccomptable</HI> Master, to whom of right it does belong to impose a <HI>Yoke,</HI> and a <HI>Burden;</HI> (for That was properly the Sub|ject of the last Service which I perform'd;) But only in the <HI>exercise</HI> and <HI>usage</HI> of it, as he is <GAP DESC="foreign">, (that is to say) a <HI>Mild,</HI> and a <HI>Gratious</HI> Master; whose <HI>Commands</HI> are so far from being <HI>burdensom</HI> and <HI>grievous,</HI> that e|ven his <HI>Yoke</HI> makes us able to bear his <HI>Bur|den,</HI> and his <HI>Burden</HI> does enable us to wear

his <HI>Yoke.</HI> At which Paradox to Nature if any Natural man stumble, he may illu|strate it to himself by the Wings of an Ea|gle, which are indeed a Real <HI>Burden,</HI> and of Considerable <HI>Weight</HI> to the Eagle's Body, but such a Burden as by which she soars up loftily towards Heaven, which for want of That Burden would be a <HI>Groveler</HI> on the Earth.

be less <HI>cowardly</HI> than <HI>Themselves,</HI> have gi|ven it out among the People, <HI>that Christ commands Impossibilities.</HI> Which is as much as to say, that His Yoke is too hard, and his Burden too heavy, and that by consequence their <HI>Rebellions</HI> are but the <HI>Infirmities of their Nature,</HI> which might have been possi|bly in their <HI>Wishes,</HI> but not at all in their <HI>Abilities</HI> to be avoided. Whereas the Truth is, they are resolv'd to <HI>sit still,</HI> to be <HI>at peace</HI> with their <HI>Temptations,</HI> and not to make the best <HI>use</HI> of the Powers within them; So that the Devil becomes <HI>strong,</HI> in that they make themselves <HI>weak;</HI> and 'tis in stead of <HI>Wisdom</HI> to him, that he finds men <HI>foolish.</HI> If at any time He <HI>conquers,</HI> it is because they do <HI>not fight;</HI> yea if he does not fly from them, it is because they do not re|sist him; for so saith St. <HI>Iames</HI> expres|ly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 4. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Resist the Devil and he will fly from you.</HI> But Cowards call their mean <HI>Submissions,</HI> their <HI>Inabilities to resist,</HI> that so they may <HI>Sin</HI> without <HI>Scruple,</HI> or at least <HI>stop</HI> the <HI>Mouth</HI> of a clamorous Conscience.

They make their Error the more Incurable, by adding to it as great a <HI>Truth,</HI> [that ha|ving done all we can, in our submission to the Burden and Yoke of Christ, we shall ne|ver be accountable for All we cannot; be|cause where our utmost obedience <HI>Ends,</HI> our Saviour's begins to be reckon'd to us.]</P>
<P>Thus Truth and Falshood are tyed toge|ther by the Necks, (as <HI>Iupiter</HI> in <HI>Plato</HI> serv'd <HI>Ioy</HI> and <HI>Sorrow,</HI>) that if they will not be <HI>friends,</HI> they may be made to be <HI>Compani|ons;</HI> and even forced to conspire against their Wills, to make us tamely submit our Necks to the Yoke of <HI>Satan,</HI> in Pretence that our <HI>Saviour's</HI> is too ruggid for us to bear.

my Text as strongly at least as I am able, and against the Exposition St. <HI>Iohn</HI> made of it against the <HI>Gnosticks:</HI> And I think I have done it with very great Rea|son.

Now if the <HI>Yoke</HI> of Christ's <HI>Pre|cepts</HI> is thus easy <HI>in it self,</HI> how smooth and easy is it to <HI>Them,</HI> who have <HI>inur'd</HI> them|selves to it by their <HI>Obedience?</HI> an Argument taken from Experience will be as cogent as any can be. <HI>David</HI> found, after a great and a long Experience, that the <HI>Command|ments of God were sweeter to him, than the Ho|ny, and Hony-comb,</HI> Psal. 19. 10. where the word <HI>Hony</HI> being us'd, by a kind of <HI>a Pro|verb</HI> among the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> for all imaginable objects of Sensual Pleasure, 'tis plain the meaning of the Prophet must needs be This; that the Pleasure arising to him from the Rectitude of his Actions, and an uniform obedience to Gods Commands, was as much greater than any pleasure which he had ever yet injoy'd in the Breaches of them, as the Pleasure which smites the <HI>Soul,</HI> is greater than That which affects the <HI>Body.</HI> Betwixt which two there is so signal and wide a Dif|ference, that (by an obvious <HI>Antimetabole</HI>) the Pleasure of the <HI>Soul</HI> is the <HI>Soul</HI> of Plea|sure; to which the pleasure of the <HI>Body</HI> is in comparison nothing more than a <HI>putrid Carcass.</HI> And as the Pleasures of the Soul are
<PB N="59" REF="37">
by much the greatest, so 'tis the Soul's <HI>great|est</HI> Pleasure, to arrive at an Ability to <HI>despise</HI> That of the Body. Such was the <HI>Savour</HI> and the <HI>Gust</HI> which <HI>David</HI> had of God's Precepts, and such was his Accompt of the <HI>Delight</HI> he took in them. And surely All People of Vertue in all the Ages of the World, have ever said the same thing from the same Ex|perience. So that if any body is not of <HI>David</HI>'s <HI>Mind,</HI> 'tis meerly for want of his <HI>Experience.</HI> For the Proof of sweet things lyes in the <HI>Trial,</HI> and the <HI>Taste.</HI> As the Psal|mist cry'd out in one place, <HI>Lord how sweet</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 119. 103.</NOTE> <HI>are thy words unto my Taste! yea sweeter than Hony unto my Mouth!</HI> So he prayed in ano|ther, <HI>Lord open thou my lips.</HI> For he knew he could not <HI>Taste</HI> that Food from Heaven, whilst carnal <HI>prejudice</HI> and <HI>perversness</HI> had <HI>shut</HI> his <HI>Mouth.</HI> First therefore having pray'd <HI>that God will open our lips,</HI> (as the Psal|mist did) we must indeavour (as He did too) to <HI>taste,</HI> and <HI>see, how gratious the Lord is,</HI> and not only in his <HI>Promises,</HI> but <HI>Precepts</HI> also. Which the <HI>oftner</HI> we <HI>taste,</HI> with the more Appetite shall we <HI>desire</HI> them. But we know not <HI>how</HI> they taste, <HI>before</HI> we <HI>taste</HI> them. As

From which expres|sions of the Psalmist it plainly follows, that the Commands of the Law Moral (which are common to <HI>Moses</HI> with <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Na|ture,</HI>) do make an excellent <HI>Collyrium,</HI> a So|veraign Oyntment or Eyesalve, to clear our Sight of those <HI>Mists,</HI> which the <HI>Devil</HI> and the <HI>World</HI> have cast before them.</P>

But of an infinitely <HI>greater,</HI> in <HI>none</HI> at all?

<Q>Wherefore we receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have Grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with Reverence and godly Fear. For our God is a Consuming Fire.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THere is something Difficult in the Text, which will (I think) be best explain'd by way of Answer to an Objection. For why is it said here, <HI>Let us have Grace?</HI> It may seem at first hearing a strange expression, whether we <HI>have</HI> it, or have it <HI>not.</HI> For if we <HI>have</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="54">
it, it seems <HI>superfluous;</HI> and if we have it <HI>not,</HI> it seems as <HI>vain.</HI> We <HI>need</HI> not say <HI>Let us have,</HI> what 'tis plain we have <HI>already</HI> be|fore we <HI>say</HI> it: And we say to <HI>no purpose, Let us have</HI> this or that, which whilst we have <HI>not,</HI> it is not in our <HI>power</HI> to have. For, Is the Grace of God Almighty at <HI>our Disposal?</HI> Can we <HI>confer</HI> it upon <HI>our selves,</HI> that it should hear be said to us, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Let us have grace?</HI> we cannot <HI>have</HI> grace till we <HI>re|ceive</HI> it, nor can we possibly <HI>receive</HI> it, till God most <HI>freely bestows</HI> it on us. What is this that he saith then, <HI>let us have grace?</HI></P>
<P>To answer this it must be known, that in many places of Scripture <HI>Grace</HI> doth signifie the <HI>Gospel.</HI> Whether as being the chief <HI>In|strument</HI> or <HI>Means</HI> of <HI>Grace;</HI> or as contain|ing and exhibiting <HI>the Covenant of Grace,</HI> which does often stand oppos'd unto the <HI>Co|venant of Works;</HI> or else as being the <HI>great Message</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Favour</HI> from <HI>Heaven</HI> to <HI>Earth.</HI> Whether for <HI>these,</HI> or for <HI>other</HI> Reasons, so it is that the word <HI>Grace</HI> doth of|ten signifie the <HI>Gospel;</HI> especially <HI>then,</HI> when 'tis oppos'd unto the <HI>Law.</HI> A clear Exam|ple of which we have, <HI>Iohn</HI> 1. 17. <HI>The Law</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="54">
<HI>came by</HI> Moses, <HI>but Grace and Truth from Ie|sus Christ:</HI> that is, The <HI>Gospel</HI> of Grace and Truth. For there was <HI>truth</HI> in the <HI>Law,</HI> as well as in the <HI>Gospel;</HI> and <HI>grace</HI> was given unto the <HI>Iews,</HI> as well as to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> of whom we are. And therefore the meaning of it must be, That as the <HI>Law</HI> came by <HI>Moses,</HI> so the <HI>Gospel of grace</HI> came down from Heaven by <HI>Iesus Christ;</HI> and so it is called by St. <HI>Paul, Acts</HI> 20. 24. Another Instance of it we have <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 14. <HI>We are not under the Law, but under Grace:</HI> that is, the <HI>Gospel of Christ</HI> which is the <HI>Word of his Grace;</HI> and so St. <HI>Paul</HI> calls it again, <HI>Acts</HI> 20. 32. For it cannot be meant concerning the <HI>grace</HI> of <HI>Sanctification;</HI> because even <HI>They</HI> were under <HI>that,</HI> who were under the <HI>Law</HI> that was gi|ven by <HI>Moses;</HI> else would <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Ioshua,</HI> and <HI>Moses</HI> himself have been <HI>void of Grace.</HI> Which being eminently Impossible, 'tis plain the <HI>Gospel</HI> must be the thing which is there opposed unto the <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>And as in <HI>other</HI> places of Scripture, so par|ticularly in <HI>This</HI> which now is under consi|deration, the <HI>Grace</HI> of God is so set, as to signifie nothing but the <HI>Gospel.</HI> And (the word
<PB N="94" REF="55" MS="y">
<GAP DESC="foreign"> very often being put for <GAP DESC="foreign">) to <HI>Have</HI> it in this place, is nothing else but to <HI>hold it fast.</HI> So that the Scope of the Exhortation, is, that we <HI>hold fast the Gospel or Law of Christ,</HI> described to be the <HI>Instrument,</HI> whereby we may perform a <HI>Service acceptable to God.</HI> But <HI>acceptable Service</HI> it cannot be, unless attend|ed with <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Reverence.</HI> To wit with a <HI>reverence</HI> of his <HI>Mercy</HI> in the <HI>beginning</HI> of the Text, and with a <HI>fear</HI> of his <HI>Wrath</HI> in the later <HI>end.</HI> The Duty therefore is here in|forced both <HI>before</HI> and <HI>behind;</HI> and that with such <HI>Reasons,</HI> as 'tis not easy to <HI>resist.</HI> For first the <HI>Reason</HI> going <HI>before</HI> is drawn from the <HI>richness</HI> of our <HI>Reward,</HI> in case we <HI>serve</HI> God as he here requires. And then the <HI>Reason</HI> coming <HI>behind</HI> is from the <HI>Grievousness</HI> of the <HI>Punishment,</HI> in case we serve him <HI>not at all,</HI> or not at all with due <HI>Reverence</HI> and <HI>godly Fear.</HI> Our <HI>reward,</HI> if we <HI>do,</HI> is no less than a <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and a Kingdom <HI>not to be moved.</HI> But our <HI>punishment</HI> (if we do <HI>not</HI>) is to <HI>pe|rish</HI> by the hand that should make us <HI>whole;</HI> to feel the <HI>God</HI> of our <HI>life</HI> a <HI>consuming fire.</HI> The one affords us an <HI>Allective,</HI> whereby to <HI>draw</HI> us to the Duty; the other an <HI>Impellent,</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="55">
to <HI>drive</HI> us <HI>on.</HI> It is the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and the <HI>Care</HI> of the holy Penman, to place our <HI>Duty</HI> in the midst of <HI>a double motive,</HI> that if the <HI>one</HI> cannot engage us, the <HI>other</HI> may. He be|gins with a <HI>Promise,</HI> to feed our <HI>Hope;</HI> and concludes with a <HI>Threat,</HI> to excite our <HI>Fear.</HI> The first as a <HI>Spur</HI> does provoke to <HI>Vertue;</HI> the second, as a <HI>Bridle,</HI> withholds from <HI>Vice.</HI> And he is sure a <HI>dull Beast,</HI> whom <HI>such</HI> a <HI>Spur</HI> cannot <HI>excite,</HI> or at least a very <HI>wild</HI> one; whom <HI>such</HI> a <HI>Bridle</HI> cannot <HI>re|strain.</HI></P>
<P>The whole circuit of the Text being thus explain'd, there are <HI>five</HI> things especially to be <HI>inferr'd.</HI></P>
<P>First that the <HI>Liberty</HI> of a Christian doth carry its <HI>Yoke</HI> along with it. It being a liberty from <HI>Moses,</HI> but not from <HI>Christ;</HI> the Condition of whose <HI>Gospel</HI> is our obedi|ence unto the <HI>Law.</HI> I do not mean the <HI>Mo|saical,</HI> whether <HI>Iudicial</HI> or <HI>Ceremonial,</HI> which were but <HI>positive</HI> Laws at best, but the <HI>Na|tural,</HI> or <HI>Moral,</HI> which is withal the <HI>Aeternal</HI> Law; The Law, of which our Saviour saith, that he came not to <HI>abrogate,</HI> but to <HI>fulfil</HI> it: Not to <HI>evacuate,</HI> but <HI>fill</HI> it up. Rather
<PB N="96" REF="56">
to <HI>strengthen,</HI> than to <HI>destroy</HI> it. <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>let us have Grace,</HI> that is, <GAP DESC="foreign">, let us <HI>hold fast</HI> the <HI>Gospel</HI> or <HI>Law of Christ.</HI> And let us hold it as an <HI>Instrument</HI> where|by to <HI>serve</HI> him. And let us serve him <GAP DESC="foreign">, so as our <HI>Persons</HI> and our <HI>Service</HI> may be <HI>accepted.</HI> But yet</P>
<P>Secondly, we cannot Serve him <HI>so,</HI> as to be <HI>accepted;</HI> (we cannot do it <GAP DESC="foreign">, so as to satisfy and <HI>please</HI> him in what we do,) unless we serve him with <HI>Reverence</HI> and <HI>godly Fear</HI> With a <HI>reverence</HI> of his <HI>Mercy,</HI> whereby we are <HI>capable</HI> of a <HI>Kingdom;</HI> and with a <HI>fear</HI> of his <HI>Wrath,</HI> whereby he becomes a <HI>consuming fire.</HI> So that the Reverence has a <HI>Retrospect</HI> on the beginning of the Text; and the <HI>fear</HI> has a <HI>Prospect</HI> upon the <HI>End.</HI> And there|fore</P>
<P>Thirdly, here is a <HI>reason</HI> for <HI>each</HI> of these <HI>Qualifications,</HI> by which our <HI>Service</HI> is to be <HI>such,</HI> as to be <HI>accepted.</HI> A reason <HI>why</HI> it must be with <HI>reverence,</HI> and a reason <HI>why</HI> it must be with <HI>fear.</HI> Let us serve God with reve|rence, <HI>because thereby we receive a Kingdom,</HI> (a Kingdom of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> too; the <HI>first</HI> being as 'twere an <HI>Inchoation</HI> of the <HI>second;</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="56">
and <HI>Both</HI> as I conceive, alluded to in this Text;) Again let us Serve him with godly fear; <HI>Because he is</HI> else <HI>a consuming fire.</HI> And then</P>
<P>Fourthly, it is obvious to infer even from <HI>hence,</HI> that the <HI>Fear</HI> of God, as a <HI>Destroyer,</HI> may nevertheless be a <HI>godly fear;</HI> because it is coupled here with <HI>Reverence,</HI> and by con|sequence with <HI>love.</HI> For Reverence is a <HI>Compound,</HI> which hath <HI>love</HI> as well as <HI>fear</HI> for a chief <HI>Ingredient.</HI> And the Fear here ex|pressed by <HI>godly</HI> Fear, is not only a fear of <HI>God's Power</HI> and <HI>Majesty,</HI> in respect of which he is a <HI>Severaign,</HI> who hath an <HI>absolute Do minion</HI> over the work of his hands; nor on|ly a fear of his <HI>love and mercy,</HI> in respect of which he is a <HI>Father,</HI> who by his Children must be <HI>revered:</HI> but especially a Fear of his <HI>Wrath and Iustice,</HI> in respect of which he is a <HI>Iudge,</HI> and so an <HI>Executor of Vengeance.</HI> It is a <HI>fear</HI> indeed of <HI>God,</HI> but under the notion of a <HI>Consumer.</HI> A <HI>fear</HI> enforced with a <HI>Reason</HI> all arm'd with <HI>terrour;</HI> (for nothing strikes terror so much as <HI>Fire.</HI>) Lastly a <HI>fear</HI> whereof the <HI>Terror</HI> is ushered in with the Causal <HI>For,</HI> which shew's the <HI>Tendency</HI> of the
<PB N="98" REF="57">
Terror towards the <HI>Godliness</HI> of the fear: for thus lyes the order and the coherence of the words. Let us serve him with Re|verence and <HI>Godly</HI> fear, <HI>For</HI> our God is a Consuming Fire.</P>
<P>Last of all we may infer from the Pro|noun<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 2. 6. to v. 11.</NOTE> <HI>our,</HI> That God is no such Accepter of Persons, as to <HI>connive</HI> at Sin in <HI>us,</HI> whilst he does <HI>punish</HI> it in <HI>others.</HI> No, <HI>the times of their ignorance God winked at,</HI> (saith the A|postle,) <HI>But now commandeth all men every where to repent.</HI> To <HI>us</HI> indeed, if we <HI>repent,</HI> he is <HI>a God ready to pardon; swift</HI> to shew <HI>mer|cy,</HI> and <HI>slow</HI> to <HI>wrath.</HI> But to <HI>us</HI> being <HI>Im|penitent</HI> he is a Terrible, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>See Deut. 4. 24. where a</HI> consuming Fire <HI>is explained by</HI> a jealous God. <HI>Which com|pare with Ex|od. 24. 17. where</HI> the glory of the Lord was like de|vouring fire upon the top of the Mount.</NOTE> a <HI>jealous,</HI> and an <HI>avenging</HI> God. From whence 'tis inferr'd by the holy Writer, That <HI>we,</HI> as well as the People <HI>Israel</HI> are bound to serve God with <HI>Fear and Reverence;</HI> Because <HI>Our</HI> God as well as <HI>Theirs</HI> is a <HI>consuming Fire.</HI> That is, the <HI>same</HI> God is such, as well to <HI>Us,</HI> as to <HI>Them.</HI> For here 'tis worthy to be observ'd, That as <HI>Moses</HI> exhorting his people <HI>Israel to take heed unto themselves, that they forget not the Covenant of the Lord their God,</HI> gave his rea|son in these words, For <HI>the Lord Thy God is</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="57">
<HI>a Consuming Fire;</HI> So our Apostle in this Chapter, having first of all compared the <HI>Law</HI> with the <HI>Gospel, Moses</HI> with <HI>Christ,</HI> and a <HI>Contemner</HI> of the <HI>one</HI> with a <HI>Despiser</HI> of the <HI>other;</HI> and having exhorted us to the <HI>Duty</HI> incumbent on us as we are <HI>Christians;</HI> gives the very <HI>same reason</HI> in the very <HI>same words,</HI> (with no more than the change of a Mono|syllable,) for <HI>OUR God is a consuming Fire.</HI> Such he is, as the God of <HI>All;</HI> but above all, as he is <HI>OURS;</HI> because <HI>we</HI> sin, when we sin, against greater <HI>light;</HI> and against great|er <HI>obligations</HI> to <HI>cease</HI> from sinning.</P>
<P>Having now done with the explication and with the division of the Text, 'twill be most <HI>useful</HI> as well as <HI>natural</HI> to begin with the <HI>first</HI> of the five Illations, Because the greatest numbers of men do stand in need of a conviction, That <HI>Christianity</HI> is a <HI>Ser|vice</HI> requiring our <HI>Industry</HI> and <HI>Care.</HI> A <HI>Service</HI> consisting of <HI>Obedience,</HI> as well as <HI>Faith;</HI> in as much as the <HI>Promises</HI> of the Gospel are clog'd with <HI>Precepts.</HI> Th&ocirc; the Yoke of Christ is easy, yet 'tis a <HI>Yoke;</HI> and th&ocirc; his Burden is light, yet 'tis a <HI>Burden</HI> To <HI>stand fast in that Liberty wherewith Christ</HI>

<P>A Doctrin the rather to be Imprinted in all our memories and our minds, (as either a method for prevention, or means of cure,) because throughout <HI>the whole catalogue of damning Haeresies,</HI> whether as that Catalogue was <HI>begun</HI> by <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> or as <HI>continued</HI> by <HI>Epiphanius,</HI> or as <HI>perfected</HI> by St. <HI>Austin,</HI> (and other <HI>Writers</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI>) none hath shed a more killing Influence upon the minds and manners of Christian People, (so far at least as I am able to conjecture,) than the <HI>mistaken,</HI> but <HI>pleasant</HI> notions, of <HI>Iustification,</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> the <HI>imputed Righte|ousness</HI> of Christ, and <HI>Christian Liberty.</HI> Hard|ly any four things are more needful to be believ'd; or more subject to be mistaken. Never was <HI>Poyson</HI> more <HI>pernicious,</HI> or more to be <HI>antidoted</HI> than <HI>that,</HI> to which I oppose the main drift of the well intended project I have in hand.</P>

<P>This I shall briefly make appear from two general Topicks, or Heads of Arguing.
<PB N="115" REF="65">
From the principal <HI>end</HI> or <HI>final cause</HI> of our Saviour's coming <HI>hither,</HI> and from his Principal <HI>business</HI> which took him up when he was <HI>here.</HI></P>
<P>First for the <HI>end</HI> of his coming <HI>hither,</HI> it was rather to redeem us from <HI>Sin,</HI> than <HI>Hell.</HI> Rather to <HI>sanctifie</HI> our <HI>Nature,</HI> than meerly to <HI>justifie</HI> our <HI>Persons;</HI> rather to <HI>make</HI> us truly <HI>Righteous,</HI> than only to <HI>reckon</HI> or <HI>count</HI> us <HI>Iust.</HI> And this may appear, as by <HI>other</HI> Reasons, so more especially by These. First that <HI>Sin</HI> is by nature far <HI>worse</HI> than <HI>Hell,</HI> Be|cause our sins can serve for nothing, but to <HI>Injure</HI> and <HI>Incense</HI> the Righteous <HI>Iudge</HI> of all the World; whereas <HI>Hell</HI> is good for <HI>some|thing;</HI> even to <HI>satisfie</HI> the <HI>Iustice</HI> which <HI>Sin</HI> hath <HI>Injur'd,</HI> and to <HI>glorifie</HI> the <HI>Iudge</HI> whom it hath <HI>Incens'd.</HI> From whence it follows, that 'tis much more conformable to the <HI>Ho|liness</HI> of God, and more advanceth his <HI>Glory</HI> too, To have sent his Son into the world, rather to <HI>purifie,</HI> than to <HI>forgive</HI> it. To <HI>for|give</HI> it indeed by a <HI>secondary</HI> intention, but to <HI>purifie</HI> it by the <HI>first;</HI> (for <HI>purity</HI> by nature being <HI>better</HI> than <HI>Pardon,</HI> by a very good se|quel was <HI>sooner</HI> meant,) To reduce us to our
<PB N="116" REF="66">
<HI>obedience</HI> as the <HI>chief purpose</HI> of his coming, and to give us <HI>Heaven</HI> as the <HI>Accession.</HI> For real happiness consisting in being <HI>holy as God is holy,</HI> 'Tis plain that <HI>Heaven</HI> can be no more, than a good <HI>Appendix</HI> of our fe|licity. For can we imagin, that God him|self can be any whit the <HI>happier</HI> for being in <HI>Heaven?</HI> No; 'Tis <HI>Heaven</HI> which is the <HI>hap|pier</HI> for being <HI>God's Throne:</HI> which should he fix upon the <HI>Earth,</HI> Heaven would pre|sently be his <HI>Footstool.</HI> As it is not the <HI>Court</HI> which gives Majesty to the <HI>King;</HI> But where|soever the <HI>King</HI> is, there's the <HI>Court.</HI> To be in Heaven <HI>without holiness,</HI> (like the lost Re|giment of Angels) would be to make it a <HI>second Hell.</HI> And therefore They, at the Day of Judgment, who shall intreat the <HI>Hills</HI> to <HI>cover</HI> them, and the <HI>Mountains to fall upon them,</HI> will have no other reason for that In|treaty, than <HI>to be hid from the face of him that sitteth upon the Throne.</HI> From whence it is obvious to infer, that to a man of <HI>impure Eyes,</HI> nothing <HI>smarts</HI> more than the <HI>Sight of Bliss.</HI> And therefore our Saviour's coming hither was <HI>first</HI> to <HI>fortifie</HI> our eyes, or to make them <HI>pure,</HI> and <HI>then</HI> to procure us the <HI>Blessed Vision.</HI></P>

Not by making it <HI>safe</HI> for them to be <HI>Sinners</HI> without Amendment. Could he come for nothing else but to proclaim a <HI>Iubilee</HI> for <HI>Malefactors,</HI> and so to make them more <HI>voluptuous,</HI> not more <HI>vertuous</HI> than before? Can we imagin that <HI>the Law</HI> was <HI>so</HI> a <HI>Schoolmaster to Christ,</HI> as that the <HI>end</HI> of his <HI>coming</HI> should be to turn us from our Books? to beg us a kind of an <HI>endless</HI>

<HEAD>HOW A <HI>Man is to work out</HI> HIS OWN SALVATION.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PHILIP. II. 12.</BIBL>
<Q>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe words (in <HI>general</HI>) are a <HI>Command,</HI> delivered by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in the Name of <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Great Master,</HI> to the <HI>Ser|vants</HI> of God, in the Church at <HI>Philippi.</HI> In which there are chiefly <HI>four</HI> things to be con|sider'd.</P>
<P>First the <HI>quality</HI> of the <HI>Servants.</HI> Next the <HI>wages</HI> which they <HI>expected.</HI> Thirdly the <HI>work,</HI> with which the wages was to be <HI>earn'd.</HI> And lastly the <HI>manner,</HI> or <HI>qualification,</HI> with which the working was to be cloath'd.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="73">First for the <HI>Quality</HI> of the Servants, <HI>They</HI> were such as had been <HI>diligent</HI> in the per|formance of their Duty. They had not only been <HI>sometimes</HI> dutiful; they had not only been good by <HI>fits;</HI> but <GAP DESC="foreign">, they had <HI>always obeyed;</HI> They had <HI>evermore</HI> liv'd in the fear of God.</P>
<P>Next for the <HI>Wages</HI> which they expected, <HI>That</HI> is expressed by [<GAP DESC="foreign">] to be <HI>Salvati|on;</HI> both as it signifies a <HI>deliverance</HI> from the tremendous <HI>Pains</HI> of <HI>Hell,</HI> and as im|porting an <HI>Advancement</HI> to the ravishing <HI>Ioys</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI></P>
<P>Then Thirdly for the <HI>Work,</HI> with which the Wages was to be earn'd, That is evi|dently <HI>obedience</HI> to the <HI>Lord Iesus Christ</HI> Very significantly implyed in the <GAP DESC="foreign">, as that looks back upon the <GAP DESC="foreign">. As ye have <HI>always obey'd,</HI> so now <HI>much more</HI> obey the Gospel. <HI>Continue</HI> the Course of your o|bedience. Go on to <HI>finish</HI> the work which ye have begun; <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>work,</HI> and <HI>work out</HI> your own Salvation.</P>
<P>Last of all, for the <HI>Manner</HI> or <HI>Qualification</HI> of the working, whereby to make it become effectual for the receiving of the Reward,
<PB N="131" REF="73">
There must be <GAP DESC="foreign">, our Salvation is to be wrought for, <HI>with Fear and Tremb|ling;</HI> And that according to the <HI>threefold Signification</HI> of this expression.</P>
<P>First with <HI>Meekness</HI> and <HI>Humility.</HI> We must not put the <HI>least Trust</HI> in the <HI>greatest Performances</HI> of our <HI>own;</HI> nor must we be <HI>puff't</HI> or <HI>lifted up</HI> with the <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Graces</HI> which <HI>God</HI> hath <HI>given</HI> us.</P>
<P>Next with <HI>Diligence</HI> and <HI>Solicitude.</HI> That we may not for <HI>want</HI> of <HI>Perseverance,</HI> finally <HI>miss</HI> of the <HI>Prize</HI> that is set before us, and for which we have hitherto as it were <HI>contended</HI> by our <HI>obedience.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly with <HI>Awefulness,</HI> and <HI>Horror,</HI> or <HI>ho|ly Dread;</HI> Because as God is (in one Cafe) a <HI>quickning Light,</HI> so he is (in another) a <HI>con|suming Fire.</HI> He who <HI>purposely</HI> created us to do him <HI>service,</HI> is He who will <HI>turn us to De|struction,</HI> unless we serve him as he <HI>Requires.</HI></P>
<P>And now to anticipate an Inquiry, how <HI>Hu|mility,</HI> and <HI>Solicitude,</HI> (as well as <HI>Awefulness</HI> and <HI>Dread,</HI> are comprehended under the notion of <HI>Fear,</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> I think it is easy to make it clear from the consideration of the <HI>Con|text;</HI> without recourse to those other Scrip|tures,
<PB N="132" REF="74">
wherein we meet with the <HI>same expres|sion.</HI> For</P>
<P>First <HI>in vain</HI> should we indeavour the <HI>working out</HI> of our <HI>Salvation,</HI> but that <HI>it is God who worketh in us both to will,</HI> and to <HI>do.</HI> And therefore we must do it with all <HI>Hu|mility</HI> of <HI>Mind,</HI> because in <HI>our</HI> selves (as <HI>of our selves</HI>) there dwelleth no good thing; no not so much as <HI>Inclination</HI> to <HI>any</HI> thing that is <HI>good,</HI> no not so much as <HI>Aversation</HI> from <HI>any</HI> thing that is <HI>evil.</HI> But <HI>every good and perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights.</HI> If we can triumph over the <HI>Law,</HI> as the <HI>strength of Sin,</HI> by treading <HI>Sin</HI> under our <HI>Feet,</HI> as the <HI>sting of Death,</HI> All the <HI>Thanks must be to God, who hath given us the Victory through our Lord Iesus Christ.</HI> And yet</P>
<P>Secondly; Although it is <HI>God that worketh in us both to will, and to do;</HI> yet the Apostle makes it a <HI>Reason,</HI> why <HI>we our selves</HI> are to <HI>work out</HI> our <HI>own Salvation.</HI> And therefore we must do it with <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Diligence,</HI> lest whilst God by his <HI>Grace</HI> is not wanting unto <HI>us,</HI> we finally miss of his <HI>Glory,</HI> by having been wanting unto <HI>our selves.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="74">Thus we see there is pregnant Reason, for the Double Importance of the Phrase as 'tis <HI>meerly rational.</HI> And of the <HI>literal</HI> Significa|tion I suppose there cannot be any Doubt. For</P>
<P>We must work out our Salvation with <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> (in as much as that sig|nifies the greatest <HI>Awefulness</HI> and <HI>Dread,</HI>) be|cause of the <HI>Dreadfulness</HI> of our <HI>Doom,</HI> in case we work <HI>not at all,</HI> or not at all to <HI>that purpose</HI> that God requires. And thus I hope I have so <HI>divided,</HI> as withal to have <HI>explain|ed,</HI> and <HI>clear'd</HI> the Text.</P>
<P>The first three Parts of the whole Divisi|on may well be thrust up together into this Doctrinal Proposition. [That our Salvation is not attainable by a meer <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> of <HI>Iudgment</HI> in point of Faith, or a bare <HI>Re|ctitude</HI> of <HI>Opinions</HI> concerning God; But by <HI>obedience</HI> to the <HI>Gospel</HI> or <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Christ.</HI>] For what is expressed by <HI>obedience,</HI> in the for|mer part of this Verse; is also expressed in the later, by <HI>the working out</HI> of <HI>our own Salva|tion.</HI> And as <HI>Salvation</HI> is a Thing which re|quires our <HI>working;</HI> So 'tis not any kind of working will serve our Turn. For</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="75" MS="y">The last Particular of the four affords us a <HI>second Proposition,</HI> which is as apt to defend us from Carnal Security, as the First. To wit, [That however Unavoidable our State of Bliss may seem to us, by our having (with the <HI>Philippians) obeyed Always,</HI> yet our <HI>obedience unto the Gospel</HI> or <HI>Law of Christ,</HI> by which alone we are to <HI>work out our own Salva|tion,</HI> is to be qualified and season'd with <HI>Fear and Trembling.</HI>]</P>

<P>To Apply this now unto our selves; If we can say with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> that our <HI>Battle</HI> is quite <HI>fought,</HI> (against the World, the Flesh, and the Devil,) And that our <HI>Course</HI> is quite <HI>fi|nished,</HI> (in so much that we are able to lay our <HI>hands</HI> upon the <HI>Goal,</HI>) we then may say with him too, <HI>Henceforth is laid up for us a Crown of Righteousness.</HI> We may say, we have a <HI>Right to the Tree of Life;</HI> That God is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>a righteous Iudge,</HI> who will not be so <HI>Unfaithful</HI> (having given us a <HI>Pro|mise,</HI>) <HI>as to forget our work and labour of love,</HI> (Heb. 6. 10.) And so being sure <HI>to be with</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="83">
<HI>Christ,</HI> we may <HI>desire to be dissolv'd too.</HI></P>
<P>But whilst we are upon the <HI>way,</HI> and we cannot tell how <HI>far</HI> from our <HI>Iourneys end;</HI> Nor what may happen 'twixt <HI>This</HI> and <HI>That;</HI> sure the use we are to make of our present <HI>standing,</HI> is to <HI>take</HI> great <HI>heed</HI> that we do not <HI>fall.</HI> We must beware, if we are <HI>righteous,</HI> that we do not <HI>return from righteousness to sin.</HI> The higher we stand in God's Favour, we must beware so much the more, that we <HI>be not high-minded,</HI> but rather <HI>fear;</HI> lest for having (like <HI>Capernaum</HI>) been <HI>lifted up to Heaven,</HI> we be the rather (like <HI>Capernaum</HI>) <HI>cast down to Hell.</HI></P>
<P>There was a Proverb among <HI>the Iews, The Sow is turned being wash't to her wallowing in the Mire.</HI> And St. <HI>Peter</HI> applys it to cer|tain <HI>Christians,</HI> who have made it good in the <HI>Application;</HI> even by growing <HI>Unrighte|ous after Regeneration,</HI> (2 Pet. 2. ult.) For having been <HI>wash'd</HI> from the <HI>Mire</HI> of Sin <HI>Original</HI> by the Laver of <HI>Baptism,</HI> and from the <HI>Mire</HI> of <HI>Sins Actual</HI> by the <HI>blood</HI> of <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> in the other <HI>Sacrament</HI> of <HI>Eucharist,</HI> they have <HI>committed</HI> the very <HI>Sins,</HI> of which they had solemnly <HI>repented,</HI> and so their

<HI>latter end</HI> hath been <HI>worse</HI> than their <HI>beginning.</HI> Now&punc; putting the Case unto our selves, we know not what may arrive betwixt the <HI>Cup</HI> and the <HI>Lip,</HI> much less betwixt This and the <HI>Day</HI> of <HI>Iudgment;</HI> especially if we meet with a Time of <HI>Trial.</HI> We cannot be <HI>confident</HI> of our <HI>strength</HI> upon any better <HI>Ground</HI> than St. <HI>Peter stood</HI> on. And having not <HI>Grace</HI> at our <HI>own Disposal,</HI> we must not <HI>boast</HI> (as he did) what we will do above others, when <HI>Christ</HI> is under a <HI>Condemnation.</HI> If we have fol|low'd him to <HI>Golgotha,</HI> we must religiously <HI>fear</HI> to forsake him <HI>there.</HI> For let our <HI>En|during</HI> be what it <HI>will,</HI> it will be found to no purpose, unless we <HI>endure unto the end.</HI> And thence it follows, that 'till we have <HI>Happi|ness in Possession,</HI> we are to live by such a <HI>Faith,</HI> as doth admit an holy mixture of <HI>fear and trembling.</HI> This <HI>Mode</HI> or <HI>Manner</HI> of our obedience being as rigidly requir'd by God Almighty, as the <HI>Matter,</HI> and <HI>Mea|sure,</HI> and <HI>Method</HI> of it. Not only <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Amendment of Life,</HI> but also <HI>Perseverance</HI> in <HI>each</HI> of These, is the <HI>Condition</HI> of the <HI>Promises</HI> which <HI>God</HI> in <HI>Christ</HI> hath made to us. <HI>Whose House we are</HI> (saith the <HI>Epistle</HI>

<P>Now what needed the holy Penman to have <HI>crowded</HI> and throng'd so many Caveats so <HI>thick together</HI> in that <HI>one Chapter,</HI> (and in other Chapters of that Epistle,) if the Peo|ple of God are so <HI>sure</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> that there is not place left for a <HI>fear of Hell?</HI> If some at least who were <HI>enlightned,</HI> and by true Grace <HI>sanctified,</HI> do turn <HI>Mammelucks</HI> and <HI>Apostates,</HI> as <HI>Lycerus</HI> hath observ'd, and as<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lycerus in Harm.

which he made heretofore to his People <HI>Is|rael.</HI> And since he <HI>swore</HI> to the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Heb. 3. 15, 16.</NOTE> <HI>Provokers</HI> which came with <HI>Moses</HI> out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> that notwithstanding his <HI>promise,</HI> (which appears by <HI>that</HI> to have been <HI>conditional,</HI>) <HI>they should not enter into his Rest,</HI> (Heb. 3. 18.) the Apo|stle tells us we ought to <HI>fear, lest</HI> (if we do as they did) <HI>we come short</HI> (as they did) of the <HI>conditional promise proposed to us,</HI> (Heb 4. 1.) And conformably to this, St. <HI>Iohn</HI> doth ear|nestly exhort us, <HI>to look to our selves, that we lose not the things which we have wrought, but that we may receive a full Reward,</HI> (2 Joh. 8.) And he that saith here for our <HI>Consolation,</HI> [<HI>It is God that worketh in us to will and to do of his good pleasure,</HI>] doth also say for our greater <HI>Caution,</HI> that we <HI>our selves</HI> are to <HI>work out our own Salvation.</HI> Plainly intima|ting unto us, (for he is not guilty of <HI>Con|tradictions,</HI>) That God's <HI>working in us</HI> to <HI>will</HI> and to <HI>do,</HI> is not after an <HI>irresistible,</HI> but <HI>con|gruous manner;</HI> not as with <HI>natural,</HI> but as with <HI>voluntary</HI> Agents; not by physically <HI>inforcing,</HI> but by morally <HI>persuading</HI> our pee|vish Wills. He doth <HI>so</HI> work with <HI>us,</HI> as to require that we also do work with <HI>Him.</HI> It
<PB N="155" REF="85">
is evinced even from <HI>hence,</HI> that as God hath <HI>his</HI> part, so we have <HI>ours,</HI> in the great <HI>Busi|ness</HI> of our <HI>Salvation,</HI> Because we are many times <HI>threatned</HI> with <HI>falling short of the pro|mise,</HI> in Case we <HI>depart from the living God.</HI> For God cannot <HI>threaten</HI> to be <HI>reveng'd</HI> up|on his <HI>Creatures,</HI> for what <HI>Himself</HI> doth ei|ther <HI>do,</HI> or <HI>not do,</HI> but for what is either <HI>performed,</HI> or not <HI>performed,</HI> by his <HI>Creatures.</HI> It being not possibly <HI>imputable</HI> to the Crea|ture, that God hath <HI>made</HI> it <HI>Thus,</HI> or <HI>Thus;</HI> any more than God himself can be <HI>accompta|ble</HI> to his Creature, <HI>why</HI> he made it <HI>Thus,</HI> or <HI>Thus.</HI> God indeed doth <GAP DESC="foreign">, most divinely <HI>work in us</HI> both to <HI>will,</HI> and to <HI>do,</HI> the <HI>work</HI> required to our <HI>Salvation.</HI> But 'tis that we may <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>work out</HI> that <HI>work</HI> which he is pleas'd to work in us.

<P>And this doth lead us to consider the <HI>third Importance</HI> of the expression, the very great <HI>Awefulness</HI> or <HI>Dread,</HI> with which we are to work out our own Salvation. The two

first were <HI>rational,</HI> this <HI>third</HI> is <HI>Literal.</HI> And indeed the <HI>third</HI> may be deduced out of the <HI>second.</HI> For if we may <HI>fall</HI> as well as o|thers, we may be lyable to <HI>vengeance,</HI> as well as others.

<P>I may say in some sense, that God made <HI>Hell</HI> for the use of <HI>all;</HI> as well of the <HI>best,</HI> as the <HI>worst</HI> of men. For a <HI>Torment</HI> only to <HI>These,</HI> who have <HI>hated knowledge,</HI> and <HI>will</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 1.</NOTE> <HI>not choose the fear of the Lord;</HI> But for a <HI>Ter|ror</HI> also to <HI>Them,</HI> whom he would <HI>therefore</HI> have to <HI>fear,</HI> that they may not <HI>feel</HI> it. That working out their Salvation with <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>trembling,</HI> they never may come to the place of <HI>Torment.</HI> The same Spirit that saith, <HI>Fear not them that can kill the Body only,</HI> (which is a fear proceeding from the spirit of Bondage,) doth also say at the same Time, <HI>But rather fear Him who can cast both Body and Soul into Hell.</HI> Implying <HI>This</HI> to be <HI>such</HI> a <HI>Fear,</HI> as doth very well consist <HI>with the spirit of Adoption.</HI> It's true indeed, we may be <HI>brutishly</HI> valiant, and <HI>over-daringly</HI> en|counter

the <HI>wrath</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> without the least <HI>fear</HI> of the <HI>pains</HI> of <HI>Hell.</HI> But <HI>this</HI> (I say) is a <HI>beastly courage;</HI> an arrant <GAP DESC="foreign"> that is to say, A <HI>fool-hardiness</HI> rather than <HI>va|lour.</HI> True <HI>Valour</HI> being <HI>That,</HI> that is built on <HI>Reason.</HI> Nor can we <HI>Reasonably</HI> be free from the fear of <HI>Hell,</HI> until we come to be <HI>sure</HI> of Heaven.

<P>We must not suffer the novel Fancy of <HI>unconditional Election</HI> to flatter us out of all <HI>fear</HI> of the wrath of God, and make us <HI>sure</HI> to <HI>miss</HI> of Heaven, by making us dream it is <HI>unavoidable.</HI> For as God in his <HI>Iudg|ment</HI> is <HI>no Respecter of Persons,</HI> so neither was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 2.</NOTE> he in his <HI>Decrees.</HI> As his <HI>Rule</HI> is in <HI>Time,</HI> to judge us <HI>according to our works;</HI> so he <HI>de|creed</HI> from all <HI>Aeternity,</HI> to proceed in <HI>Time</HI> by <HI>that Rule.</HI> He did determin the <HI>end</HI> of <HI>men,</HI> with a special <HI>respect</HI> to their <HI>Qualifica|tions,</HI> (from whence his <HI>Decree</HI> is call'd <HI>re|spective,</HI>) But he did absolutely determin that men who are thus or thus <HI>qualified,</HI> should come to <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that</HI> end.

could wish that this <HI>Distinction</HI> (since 'tis suf|ficient of it self) might find so much fa|vour in all mens Eyes, as to <HI>appease</HI> and <HI>re|concile</HI> dissenting Brethren.

For the Decree which is <HI>respective</HI> in <HI>sensu diviso,</HI> may so be proved to be <HI>Absolute</HI> in <HI>sensu composito,</HI> as to afford a Demon|stration, That God's <HI>Decree</HI> of the several <HI>Ends</HI> was in <HI>respect</HI> to the several <HI>Means.</HI> For if in <HI>sensu composito,</HI> He did absolutely decree, that all who are <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>repent</HI> should belong to <HI>Heaven,</HI> and that all who
<PB N="159" REF="87">
are <HI>faithless</HI> and <HI>impenitent</HI> should in like manner belong to <HI>Hell;</HI> Then his Decree was <HI>respective</HI> (in <HI>sensu diviso</HI>) of that <HI>Repen|tance,</HI> or <HI>Impenitence,</HI> by which Professors do belong to <HI>Heaven,</HI> or <HI>Hell.</HI> From whence it follows unavoidably, that if we are <HI>faithless</HI> and <HI>impenitent,</HI> (be it in a <HI>greater,</HI> or <HI>lesser</HI> measure,) we ought to be affected with <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>trembling,</HI> (in the <HI>lite|ral</HI> sense of this expression,) and never to give our selves Rest, until we be <HI>faithful,</HI> and do <HI>repent.</HI> But faithful and penitent we cannot be, till by the power of God's Grace, (after our <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Tears</HI> shall have given him <HI>no Rest</HI>) he shall be pleas'd to work <HI>in us,</HI> and <HI>with</HI> us too, not only to <HI>will,</HI> but to <HI>do</HI> his work. That by the pow|er of his Grace we <HI>may</HI> all <HI>endeavour,</HI> and by the power of his Grace <HI>on</HI> our Endea|vours, we our selves may have a <HI>Power</HI> too, whereby to <HI>work out our own Salvation.</HI> And work for it we must with a sacred <HI>horror,</HI> because of the <HI>Dreadfulness</HI> of our <HI>Doom,</HI> if we work <HI>remissly.</HI> For as (on one side) God himself cannot <HI>condemn</HI> us, (al|though our sins past have been very <HI>great,</HI>)
<PB N="160" REF="88">
if we immediately <HI>repent</HI> and <HI>amend</HI> our <HI>lives,</HI> because he is <HI>faithful who hath promi|sed,</HI> and he hath <HI>promised forgiveness</HI> to all that <HI>repent</HI> and <HI>turn</HI> unto him; so withal (on the other side) Let our Righteousness past have been what it will, yet if we <HI>return from Righteousness to Sin,</HI> God himself can|not <HI>save</HI> us, without our <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation,</HI> because he hath <HI>sworn</HI> that the <HI>Impenitent</HI> shall <HI>not enter</HI> into his <HI>Rest.</HI> Not that God can be <HI>overpower'd</HI> by any <HI>Quality</HI> in the <HI>Creature,</HI> whether <HI>Repentance</HI> in the first Case, or <HI>Impenitence</HI> in the <HI>second;</HI> But because his <HI>Power</HI> (in the <HI>first</HI>) is suspended by his <HI>Mercy,</HI> as it stands in conjunction with his <HI>Truth.</HI> For in his <HI>Mer|cy</HI> he made a <HI>Promise</HI> to give us <HI>pardon</HI> if we <HI>repent,</HI> and in his <HI>Truth</HI> he must <HI>perform</HI> it. Just so his <HI>Power</HI> (in the second) is suspended by his <HI>Iustice,</HI> as it stands in conjunction with his <HI>Truth</HI> too.

<P>Now since each of these Cases concerns us <HI>All,</HI> (be we never so <HI>good,</HI> or be we ne|ver so <HI>evil,</HI>) I need not shew by another
<PB N="161" REF="88">
<HI>Medium how</HI> the <HI>love</HI> of God's <HI>Mercy</HI> doth consist with a <HI>fear</HI> of his <HI>Indignation,</HI> and how whilst we <HI>love</HI> him as a <HI>Father,</HI> we ought to <HI>fear</HI> him as a Judge.</P>
<P>But (to conclude with such a <HI>Caveat,</HI> as may best of all become an <HI>Ingenuous</HI> People) Take we heed that our <HI>Fear</HI> do not swallow up our <HI>Love;</HI> for fear it swallow up <HI>us</HI> too in the <HI>Bottomless Pit</HI> of <HI>Desperation.</HI> We must <HI>serve</HI> God with <HI>Fear,</HI> but so as to <HI>fear</HI> him also for <HI>Love.</HI> Ever saying with the Psalmist, <HI>There is mercy with thee &ocirc; Lord, therefore&punc; shalt thou be feared.</HI> The Psalmist did not thus argue, <HI>There is Mercy with Thee &ocirc; Lord,</HI> Therefore shalt thou be <HI>rely'd upon,</HI> Therefore we shall make the <HI>bolder</HI> with thee; we shall break thy Command|ments without the <HI>fear</HI> of being <HI>damn'd,</HI> be|cause we know thou art <HI>slow</HI> to <HI>anger,</HI> and being <HI>angry</HI> art quickly <HI>pleas'd;</HI> But because of thy <HI>mercy</HI> thou shalt be <HI>feared.</HI> And there is good reason for it. For by how much the <HI>kinder</HI> a Father is, a well-natur'd Son will <HI>fear</HI> to <HI>offend</HI> him so much the <HI>more.</HI> And the more our <HI>Father</HI> which is in Heaven does even <HI>delight</HI> to please <HI>us,</HI> (by heaping his
<PB N="162" REF="89">
<HI>Mercies</HI> and <HI>Favours</HI> on us,) by so much the more shall we be <HI>afraid,</HI> (if we are <HI>well-natur'd</HI> Children) to <HI>exasperate</HI> our <HI>Father</HI> which is in Heaven.</P>
<P>What then remains, but that we <HI>ponder</HI> these things, and <HI>lay them up</HI> in our <HI>hearts,</HI> and <HI>draw</HI> them <HI>forth</HI> into our <HI>Actions,</HI> and daily <HI>repeat</HI> them in our <HI>Lives,</HI> And reap the comfort of so doing, in the <HI>hour</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> and the <HI>Day</HI> of <HI>Iudgment.</HI></P>

<P>In which <HI>Inquiry</HI> of the <HI>Iailour</HI> there are <HI>Four Things observable.</HI> First the <HI>End</HI> of the Inquiry; Next the <HI>Means</HI> conducing to it; Then the <HI>necessary Connexion</HI> between the <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>other;</HI> And lastly the <HI>Person</HI> here <HI>In|quiring,</HI> together with the <HI>Persons inquired of.</HI></P>
<P>First the <HI>End</HI> of the Inquiry is here ex|pressed to be <HI>Salvation.</HI> 'Tis <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>That I may be sav'd.</HI></P>
<P>Next the <HI>Means</HI> of its <HI>Attainment</HI> (which make the <HI>Object</HI> of his Inquiry) are here im|ply'd to consist in <HI>Practice.</HI> For it is not thus ask't, what must I outwardly <HI>Profess?</HI> or what must I inwardly <HI>believe?</HI> But <GAP DESC="foreign">; what must I <HI>Do,</HI> that I may be sav'd?</P>

<P>Lastly The <HI>Person here Inquiring,</HI> toge|ther with the <HI>Persons inquired of,</HI> are The <HI>Iai|lour</HI> and his <HI>two Pris'ners, Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas.

<P>This indeed is the <HI>Division,</HI> But it is not

<HI>nice</HI> enough to be the measure of my In|tent in the <HI>Tractation</HI> of the Text.

the <HI>Scriptures;</HI> That by the <HI>knowledge</HI> of some Praemisses which he might easily <HI>com|prehend,</HI> he might attain to a <HI>Belief</HI> of what was yet <HI>Incomprehensible.</HI> To beget in him a <HI>solid</HI> and a <HI>well-grounded</HI> Faith, such as whereof he might be able to give a <HI>rational Accompt,</HI> they both exhorted him to <HI>believe in,</HI> and <HI>also preached</HI> to him the <HI>WORD</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ; the <HI>object</HI> of our <HI>Faith</HI> which is here <HI>imply'd.</HI></P>
<P>Come we now, from <HI>the double Object,</HI> to observe in the Text <HI>a double Act</HI> too. Whereof the first is <HI>Internal,</HI> and that <HI>express'd;</HI> the second <HI>External,</HI> and that <HI>imply'd.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Act Internal,</HI> which is <HI>express'd,</HI> is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>to believe.</HI> The <HI>Act External,</HI> which is <HI>imply'd,</HI> is <HI>to confess</HI> what is believ'd in spite of Temptations to <HI>conceal</HI> it. (And this did the <HI>Iailour</HI> of <HI>Philippi</HI> in the next Verses after my Text.) For as inwardly with the <HI>Heart</HI> a man <HI>believeth</HI> unto <HI>righteousness,</HI> so <HI>outwardly</HI> with the <HI>Mouth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Rom. 10. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Confession</HI> is made unto <HI>Salvation.</HI> Indeed the <HI>Gnosticks</HI> were all for the <HI>Inward Act only,</HI> for the better avoiding of Persecution.

<HI>Inward</HI> Act <HI>without</HI> it is not <HI>sincere.</HI> Thence it is that they are <HI>coupl'd</HI> as the <HI>condition</HI> of <HI>Salvation,</HI> Rom. 10. 9. <HI>If thou shalt confess with thy Mouth the Lord Iesus, and believe in thine Heart that God hath raised him from the Dead, thou shalt be sav'd. Believing</HI> and <HI>speaking</HI> are from <HI>the same spirit of Faith,</HI> 2 Cor. 4. 13. <HI>It is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken. We also believe, and therefore speak.</HI> A <HI>double Act</HI> then there <HI>must be, if the end be to be sav'd.</HI> A True <HI>Believer</HI> must be a <HI>Confessor</HI> in time of <HI>Trial,</HI> And when duly call'd to it, a <HI>Martyr</HI> too.</P>
<P>Again, As the <HI>Object,</HI> and the <HI>Act,</HI> so too the <HI>Subject</HI> of it is <HI>double.</HI> For though <HI>begun</HI> in the <HI>Intellect,</HI> yet 'tis <HI>consummated</HI> in the <HI>Will,</HI> (as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Aq. 22<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">. q. 4. art. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Aquinas</HI> and his <HI>Followers</HI> do right|ly state it,) or else it would be meerly an <HI>human Faith, Fides cui potest subesse Dubium,</HI> a Faith whose very <HI>formal Reason</HI> is a <HI>radical Fear,</HI> (I do not mean an <HI>ingenuous,</HI> but <HI>carnal</HI> Fear,) a Faith <HI>without Love,</HI> and <HI>without Activity,</HI> and so <HI>without</HI> the effect of <HI>Obedi|ence</HI> too.

<PB N="224" REF="120">
<HI>Practical habit.</HI> And truly such is <HI>That Faith</HI> which is required in the Text, as may ap|pear by the <HI>Effects</HI> and <HI>Products</HI> of it in the Context.

<P>After the <HI>Object,</HI> and the <HI>Act,</HI> and the <HI>Sub|ject</HI> of this Belief, (each of which is two|fold,) we are in order to reflect on the <HI>Na|ture</HI> of it.

Believe his <HI>Power,</HI> for he is <HI>Dominus, The Lord.</HI> And believe his <HI>Propensity,</HI> for he is <HI>Iesus,</HI> the <HI>Sa|viour.</HI> Well therefore said the Author of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews, Whosoever cometh</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11. 6.</NOTE> <HI>to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</HI> Now what is thus said of <HI>God,</HI> is exactly true of
<PB N="226" REF="121" MS="y">
the <HI>Lord Iesus Christ.</HI> For <HI>God was in Christ</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5. 19.</NOTE> <HI>reconciling the World unto himself.</HI> And who|soever cometh to Christ, must <HI>believe,</HI> as that he <HI>is,</HI> so withal that he is a <HI>Rewarder</HI> too. A Rewarder, but of <HI>whom?</HI> and on what <HI>Condition?</HI> for he is not a Rewarder of <HI>all in general,</HI> no nor of <HI>All</HI> that do <HI>believe</HI> him to have the Office of <HI>a Rewarder,</HI> But of all such as <HI>seek</HI> him, and that <HI>with dili|gence,</HI> And of all who <HI>thus</HI> believe <HI>in</HI> Him as <HI>in</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ. Such an im|portant monosyllable is the Praeposition <HI>in,</HI> (as 'tis the English of the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign">, and in conjunction with an <HI>Accusative,</HI>) that the <HI>Life</HI> of the Text would be <HI>lost</HI> without it. For standing here, as it does, betwixt the <HI>Act,</HI> and the <HI>Object,</HI> it does imply the true <HI>nature</HI> of saving Faith.</P>
<P>Pass we on from the <HI>Nature</HI> to the <HI>Ne|cessity</HI> of Believing. Which here is visibly imply'd by the <HI>Retrospect</HI> of the Text, as 'tis an <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>Question,</HI> [<GAP DESC="foreign">, what <HI>must</HI> I do that I may <HI>be sav'd?</HI>] for sure the <HI>sense</HI> of the <HI>Answer,</HI> if it be <HI>adaequate</HI> to the <HI>Question,</HI> must needs be This, Thou <HI>must</HI> be|lieve in the Lord Jesus Christ.

<PB N="227" REF="121">
<HI>Necessity,</HI> and <HI>indispensably requir'd.</HI> For, as without our <HI>pleasing God,</HI> it is impossible to be <HI>sav'd,</HI> so (we know) <HI>without Faith, it is impossible to please him,</HI> Heb. 11. 6.</P>
<P>Last of all we have here the <HI>Issue,</HI> or the <HI>Conclusion</HI> of the whole Matter, at once <HI>im|plyed</HI> in the <HI>Reflexion</HI> of the <HI>Answer</HI> upon the <HI>Question,</HI> and <HI>expressed</HI> in the <HI>words</HI> of the Answer too. <HI>Salvation</HI> is not the <HI>Effect,</HI> but yet the necessary <HI>event</HI> of our Faith in Christ.

For the Question having been This, [<HI>What must I do that I may be sav'd,</HI>] to which the Answer is, <HI>Believe, and thou shalt be sav'd,</HI> (An Answer given by <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> who spake <HI>as the Spirit gave them utterance,</HI>) here does arise a <HI>mutual Inference,</HI> as of the <HI>Prae|cept</HI> and the <HI>Promise,</HI> so of the <HI>Duty</HI> and the <HI>Reward.</HI> Here is a necessary <HI>Tendency</HI> of the <HI>first</HI> towards the <HI>second,</HI> and a necessary <HI>De|pendence</HI> of the <HI>second</HI> upon the <HI>first.</HI> For as <HI>Salvation</HI> cannot be had (by such as live un|der

does arise from an <HI>Habit</HI> of <HI>saving Faith.</HI> For as every one that <HI>paints</HI> is <HI>not</HI> presently <HI>a Painter,</HI> nor every <HI>Painter</HI> an <HI>Apelles;</HI> so 'tis not every <HI>Belief</HI> which can denominate <HI>a Believer,</HI> nor is it every <HI>Believer</HI> who can be <HI>sav'd.</HI> It will not therefore be sufficient to preach up the <HI>Faith of Christ in general,</HI> (which yet too many are wont to do, because 'tis easiest to be done,) nor to depredicate in particular the several rare <HI>Fruits</HI> and <HI>Effects</HI> of Faith, without distinguishing all along betwixt the <HI>Roots</HI> and the <HI>Causes</HI> from whence they <HI>grow;</HI> But we must first have the <HI>Patience</HI> to learn <HI>our selves,</HI> and then the <HI>Care</HI> as well as <HI>Skill</HI> to make it <HI>visible</HI> un|to <HI>others,</HI> how much <HI>The Habit</HI> of <HI>salvifick</HI> or <HI>saving Faith</HI> is meant to <HI>grasp</HI> and <HI>compre|hend</HI> in its <HI>whole Importance;</HI> and so (by a consequence unavoidable) how much <HI>short</HI> of Salvation, <HI>every</HI> Faith, <HI>without This,</HI> will be sure to land us.</P>

<P>But this is not all. For I observe the <HI>Compellation</HI> hath a <HI>twofold Aspect</HI> upon the <HI>Question;</HI> and seems to give us a <HI>pregnant Reason</HI> at once for the <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of it.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="144">First here is something to be <HI>done</HI> by eve|ry <HI>Follower</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and that because He is a <HI>Master.</HI> It is not, Master, <HI>what shall I say,</HI> or Master, <HI>what shall I believe,</HI> but <GAP DESC="foreign">; Master, what shall I <HI>Do?</HI></P>
<P>Here is Secondly observable in this Can|didate of Heaven, a <HI>meek Resignedness</HI> of <HI>mind</HI> to <HI>any</HI> Command of Christ imaginable, and that because he is a <HI>Good,</HI> or a <HI>Gracious Master.</HI> The <HI>Servant</HI> presumes not to <HI>choose</HI> his work, He does not <HI>bargain</HI> for Life Ae|ternal at such a Rate as he thinks fit, with a [Master, I <HI>will</HI> do <HI>this,</HI> or <HI>that,</HI>] but <HI>inde|finitely</HI> asks (with an humble kind of <HI>In|difference,</HI>) <GAP DESC="foreign">; <HI>what</HI> shall I do?</P>
<P>These are Particulars more than enough, not only to <HI>exercise</HI> and <HI>entertain</HI> our Atten|tions, but (perhaps) to <HI>distract</HI> them too. And therefore it cannot be taken ill, if I shall gather their whole <HI>Result</HI> into <HI>Four Doctrinal Propositions.</HI></P>
<P>First that the <HI>Son</HI> of God <HI>Incarnate,</HI> who at present is our <HI>Advocate,</HI> and will hereaf|ter be our <HI>Iudge,</HI> and who purposely came to <HI>save</HI> us from the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of our <HI>Sins,</HI> is not only A <HI>Saviour,</HI> to propose <HI>Promises</HI> to our
<PB N="274" REF="145">
<HI>Faith;</HI> But also A <HI>Master,</HI> to challenge <HI>obe|dience</HI> to his <HI>Commands.</HI> We must not only <HI>believe</HI> him, which is but to have him in our <HI>Brains;</HI> nor must we only <HI>confess</HI> him, which is but to have him in our <HI>Mouths;</HI> no nor must we only <HI>love</HI> him, though That is to have him in our <HI>Hearts;</HI> but farther yet we must <HI>obey</HI> him, and do him <HI>Service,</HI> which is to have him in our <HI>Hands</HI> and our <HI>Actions</HI> too. <GAP DESC="foreign">; <HI>Master,</HI> what shall I <HI>do?</HI> And yet</P>
<P>Secondly; Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is not any way a <HI>Severe</HI> or <HI>Aegyptian|like</HI> Master, who looks to reap where he never sow'd, and exacts store of work with|out allowing any Materials; but a Master full of <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Lovingkindness.</HI> And this he is in <HI>two respects.</HI> To wit of the <HI>work</HI> which he <HI>requires,</HI> which is not <HI>foesible</HI> only, but <HI>pleasant;</HI> and of the <HI>wages</HI> which he <HI>pro|miseth, Aeternal Life.</HI> For each of these rea|sons, which do arise out of the Text, he is <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>A good Master.</HI> And therefore</P>
<P>Thirdly, We must in <HI>gratitude</HI> unto so <HI>Good</HI> a <HI>Master</HI> as <HI>This,</HI> behold our selves as
<PB N="275" REF="145">
obliged to <HI>two Returns;</HI> to wit a <HI>Readiness</HI> of <HI>Obedience,</HI> and a <HI>Resignedness</HI> of <HI>Wills.</HI> First a <HI>Readiness</HI> of <HI>obedience,</HI> even because he is our <HI>Master;</HI> next a <HI>Resignedness</HI> of <HI>wills,</HI> because he is our <HI>Good</HI> Master. Our Christian Tribute to <HI>both together,</HI> [to wit his <HI>Authori|ty,</HI> and his <HI>Goodness,</HI>] must not only be <HI>Uni|versal,</HI> but <HI>Unconstrain'd.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">; <HI>what</HI> shall I do? that is to say, <HI>I will do any thing.</HI> I am <HI>ready</HI> to perform <HI>whatever</HI> Service thou shalt <HI>appoint,</HI> be it never so <HI>harsh,</HI> or be it never so <HI>difficult.</HI> Eternal Life is such a <HI>Prize,</HI> as for which I can never do <HI>enough.</HI> I say not therefore what I <HI>will</HI> do, but humbly <HI>ask</HI> what I <HI>shall.</HI> Yet</P>
<P>Fourthly and lastly; When we have done the most we can we are <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">, Luk. 17. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Unprofitable Ser|vants.</HI> Our <HI>Obedience</HI> is not the <HI>Cause,</HI> but the aequitable <HI>Condition</HI> of our Reward.

<P>First the <HI>Person</HI> here <HI>inquiring</HI> had three remarkable <HI>Qualifications; Youth, Wealth,</HI> and <HI>Honour.</HI> And yet for all that, he did not ask as a <HI>young</HI> man, <HI>How shall I purchase the sweetest Pleasures?</HI> nor yet as a <HI>Rich</HI> man, <HI>How shall I compass the greatest wealth?</HI> no

nor yet as a <HI>Ruler, How shall I climb to the highest Pinacle of Preferment:</HI> But notwith|standing his three <HI>Impediments</HI> pulling him <HI>down</HI> towards the <HI>Earth,</HI> he seemed wholly to be solicitous, <HI>How he might come by a place in Heaven.</HI> And therefore hence we are to take out a <HI>threefold Lesson;</HI> one for <HI>Young</HI> men, ano|ther for <HI>Rich</HI> men, a third for <HI>Rulers.</HI> (And I suppose of <HI>these three,</HI> this particular Con|gregation does now consist).</P>
<P>First our <HI>Young</HI> men must learn, from the <HI>example</HI> of this <HI>Inquirer,</HI> to <HI>remember their Creator in the days of their youth, whilst the e|vil days come not, nor the years draw nigh when they shall say, We have no pleasure in them,</HI> (Prov. 12. 1.) And that especially for these <HI>three Reasons.</HI></P>
<P>First the <HI>younger</HI> any one is, he came the <HI>more lately</HI> out of the <HI>Hands</HI> of his <HI>Creator;</HI> and has had the <HI>less time,</HI> to grow <HI>forgetful of the Rock out of which he was hewn.</HI> It is with mens <HI>Souls</HI> as with their <HI>Bodies,</HI> and with their <HI>Bodies</HI> as with their <HI>Cloaths;</HI> The <HI>newer,</HI> commonly the <HI>better;</HI> and the <HI>older,</HI> so much the <HI>worse.</HI> A <HI>little</HI> evil Communica|tion is enough to <HI>ferment</HI> the <HI>greatest Mass</HI>

of good manners. And if the <HI>whole World does lye in wickedness,</HI> (as St. <HI>Iohn</HI> affirms it does,) how can we look to be the <HI>purer,</HI> by growing <HI>old</HI> and <HI>decrepit</HI> in so much <HI>Dirt?</HI> no, the longer we converse with <HI>Pitch</HI> or <HI>Birdlime,</HI> (to which the <HI>wickedness</HI> of the <HI>World</HI> may very happily be compar'd) It is by so much the <HI>harder</HI> to make us <HI>clean.</HI> Be|sides, we ought to <HI>run</HI> after Christ, (like this <HI>Inquirer</HI> in the Text,) not go to him like a <HI>Torpedo,</HI> as if we did not <HI>affect,</HI> but <HI>fear</HI> him; or <HI>tanquam Bos ad Cer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ma,</HI> as if we were afraid to be <HI>baited</HI> by him. But now the <HI>younger</HI> any man is, he can <HI>run</HI> so much the <HI>faster;</HI> whereas grown <HI>old</HI> he will hard|ly <HI>go.</HI> It was therefore the <HI>Blessing</HI> of God to <HI>Enoch,</HI> that <HI>he took him away speedily,</HI> and e|ven <HI>hasten'd</HI> to cut him off, to the end <HI>that wickedness might not alter his Understanding, nor deceipt beguile his Soul,</HI> (Wisd. 4. 11, 14.) This was That that gave <HI>occasion</HI> to the <HI>young</HI> mans <HI>Inquiry</HI> which lyes before us.

<HI>it as a little Child,</HI> (v. 15.) He immediately consider'd within himself, That notwith|standing he was hitherto a <HI>young man,</HI> he had yet <HI>outliv'd</HI> his harmless <HI>Childhood;</HI> and that the <HI>longer</HI> he should <HI>live,</HI> the farther off he should grow from a <HI>little Child;</HI> and so it concern'd him very <HI>nearly</HI> (even before he grew <HI>older,</HI> and heap't up <HI>sins</HI> as well as <HI>years,</HI>) to address himself to Christ with this Petition. For God's sake, Master, re|solve me one Question. If 'tis true, what thou say'st, That <HI>little Children</HI> are the <HI>Inha|bitants</HI> of which the Kingdom of God is more especially made up; what then shall I do, who am <HI>no little Child, that I also may inherit Eternal Life?</HI> The consideration of which Example ought to provoke us to <HI>ae|mulation,</HI> and to be prevalent also with <HI>Us,</HI> to <HI>remember our Redeemer in the days of our youth,</HI> whilst we have had but a <HI>little Time,</HI> to be <HI>infected</HI> with a <HI>sick</HI> and <HI>contagious</HI> World.</P>
<P>Again the <HI>younger</HI> any one is, the more capable he is of a <HI>deep Impression.</HI> As when a <HI>new Vessel</HI> is season'd with this or that Li|quor, it will savour of it the longer for be|ing

So if a man is well <HI>principl'd</HI> and well <HI>disposed</HI> from his <HI>youth,</HI> or suck in <HI>good man|ners</HI> almost as soon as he does his <HI>Milk,</HI> Ver|tue will <HI>cleave</HI> to him as <HI>close,</HI> as his two <HI>Essentials;</HI> 'twill be his <GAP DESC="foreign">, (as <HI>Ga|len</HI> elegantly) that is, a kind of <HI>acquired Na|ture.</HI> But he who is an <HI>old</HI> Sinner, or a Sin|ner in <HI>Grain,</HI> will find it as difficult not to be so, as for a <HI>Leopard to change his spots, or a Blackmore his skin,</HI> Jer. 13. 23. <HI>Aegrius eji|citur&punc;</HI> And it is by much an easier thing, at <HI>first</HI> to <HI>put on</HI> the Armour of Light, than at <HI>last</HI> to <HI>cast off</HI> the Works of Darkness.

<P>This is the <HI>use</HI> we are to make of the <HI>se|cond</HI> Qualification of our Inquirer, and This is chiefly the <HI>reason</HI> on which 'tis <HI>built.</HI></P>

and of more <HI>Teachable Dispositions.</HI> That alone is <HI>true Nobleness,</HI> which is sometimes The <HI>Daughter,</HI> and still the <HI>Mother</HI> of Hu|mility.

<P>Nor is True Nobleness more the <HI>Daugh|ter,</HI> than 'tis the <HI>Mother</HI> of Humility. For as the <HI>Lowliness of Mary</HI> made her the <HI>Mother of our Lord,</HI> so she was much the <HI>more lowly</HI> for That <HI>Advancement.</HI> And so <HI>The Ruler</HI> in the Gospel, (who is ennobl'd by <HI>Three</HI> E|vangelists,

Look of what temper an earthly Father is wont to find his little Child, a Child that trembles at every <HI>Threat,</HI> and is easily kept in awe by an <HI>angry Look,</HI> of the very same Temper ought Himself also to be, in respect of <HI>His</HI> Father who is in Heaven.</P>
<P>But now, besides the single Reason which has been given by <HI>Siracides;</HI> There are other Reasons assignable, why <HI>the greater any man is, he is to humble himself the more.</HI> He must be <HI>humbler,</HI> being a <HI>Master,</HI> than whilst he was yet but his Master's <HI>Man.</HI> Still the low|er,

<P>That is to say, <HI>He shall not.</HI> (According to the Rule of all Grammarians and Rhe|toricians, that an Affirmative Interroga|tion is the most forcible way of expres|sing a flat and positive Denial.)</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>&sect; 1. THE <HI>Cohaerence</HI> 'twixt These, and the words foregoing, is so <HI>hard</HI> to be <HI>discerned</HI> at first appearance,
<PB N="418" REF="217">
that some have thought there is <HI>none at all.</HI> For if God will come speedily to the <HI>Aveng|ing of his Elect,</HI> (as our Saviour saith he will, in the two next Verses before my Text,) who were <HI>not Elected</HI> without a <HI>Praescience,</HI> as well of their <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> as of their <HI>Faith;</HI> How can it be that <HI>when He comes, He shall not find Faith upon the Earth?</HI> But if we atten|tively consider the Text before us, as it stands in relation to <HI>all</HI> the Verses going be|fore, and more especially to the <HI>first,</HI> This Objection will quickly vanish, and we shall find a good Connexion, between the prae|cedent, and praesent words. For our Lord having exhorted The Neophyte-Disciples to whom he spake, <HI>Not to faint in their Pray|ers,</HI> but <HI>to pray-on with Perseverance,</HI> (v. 1.) excites them to it with an Assurance, that their Prayers shall not be fruitless. And that their Prayers shall not be fruitless, He convinceth them by an Argument <HI>&agrave; minori ad majus.</HI> This appears by his whole Para|ble touching the <HI>Widows Importunity,</HI> praevail|ing over the Heart of an <HI>hardned Iudge.</HI> From whence the Argument is as natural, as it is logical, and convincing.

Yes the time is now coming, when They shall be <HI>freed</HI> from their <HI>Afflictions,</HI> and when the Vengeance due from God shall speedi|ly fall on the <HI>Authors</HI> of them. To which He adds by way of <HI>complaint,</HI> and by a Compassionate <HI>Erot&eacute;sis,</HI> or <HI>Expostulation, (cohaering</HI> with what he said before, by a <HI>Conjunction Adversative,</HI>) that when He shall come in the later Days to be an <HI>Avenger of his Elect,</HI> The Apostasie will be so general, He will find <HI>but Few</HI> of them. Of <HI>the ma|ny who are Called,</HI> He will find <HI>but few Chosen.</HI> Amongst a Multitude of Flatterers, he will find but few Friends. In a world of Prae|tenders,

<P>&sect; 2. We see The <HI>Cohaerence</HI> of the Text, which will help us not to err in the <HI>Mean|ing</HI> of it. For in that our Lord asks, <HI>When the Son of Man cometh, shall He find Faith upon the Earth?</HI> It is as if he should have said in plain and peremptory Terms, That at his second Coming from Heaven to judge the Inhabitants of the Earth, He shall not find <HI>Many</HI> Christians, who will pray with <HI>that</HI> Faith, which alone can inable them to <HI>pray without ceasing, and not to faint.</HI> When He shall come to save <HI>Believers,</HI> He will find <HI>but few</HI> such in the <HI>Gospel-sense.</HI> Not <HI>none simpliciter,</HI> but <HI>none secundum quid. Compa|ratively</HI> none, or <HI>none to speak of.</HI> The <HI>great|est part</HI> of men will perish, even for want of <HI>That Faith,</HI> whereby men's <HI>Prayers</HI> become <HI>effectual.</HI> 'Tis not through any defect of <HI>Goodness,</HI> and <HI>longanimity</HI> in <HI>God,</HI> that so <HI>few</HI> will be safe in the Day of Judgment; But

through a miserable defect of Christian <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> The great <HI>Condition</HI> of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> which God in Christ (the only true <HI>Shechinah</HI>) was pleas'd to make with the <HI>Sons of Men.</HI> Historical Faith there is in <HI>many,</HI> such as is common to men with <HI>Devils,</HI> who are said by St. <HI>Iames,</HI> to <HI>be|lieve, and tremble.</HI> A sturdy <HI>Praesumption</HI> there is in <HI>Many,</HI> which they mistake for the <HI>perfection</HI> and <HI>strength</HI> of Faith. A <HI>Car|nal Security</HI> is in <HI>Many,</HI> which they take to be the <HI>Product</HI> and <HI>Fruit</HI> of Faith.

<ITEM>2. The Second is, That <HI>all the Goods of this World,</HI> however <HI>lovely</HI> they may appear to <HI>Carnal Reason,</HI> or <HI>Common Sense,</HI> are yet by God's <HI>Patience,</HI> and wise <HI>Permissi|on,</HI> in the <HI>Devil</HI>'s <HI>Proffer,</HI> and <HI>Disposal.</HI> I

say They are so <HI>by God's Permission,</HI> be|cause the Devil can give nothing, till God gives <HI>leave;</HI> which, for wise and just Ends, it often pleaseth him to afford.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Third Doctrin is, That the utmost <HI>Scope</HI> and <HI>Drift</HI> of all the <HI>Donatives</HI> of the <HI>Tempter,</HI> is to <HI>steal</HI> our Hearts from <HI>God,</HI> and to <HI>turn</HI> them wholly upon <HI>Himself.</HI> He never <HI>Proffers,</HI> but with a danger|ous <HI>Proviso.</HI> He does it <HI>liberally</HI> indeed, [<HI>All these things will I give thee,</HI>] But with a <HI>covetous</HI> Supposition, [<HI>if, falling down, thou wilt worship me.</HI>]</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. From whence it follows in the fourth Place, That how incessantly soever some men do <HI>labour,</HI> whereby to <HI>purchase</HI> these Gifts of Satan, yet there is nothing in the World with greater easiness to be compass'd; if the Devil may be try'd by his own <HI>Confession.</HI> Who, though the things here spoken of are great, and goodly, (<HI>even the Kingdoms of the Earth, and the Glory of them,</HI>) is yet most <HI>ready</HI> to part with <HI>All,</HI> in exchange for an <HI>Act</HI> of our <HI>Adoration.</HI> To attain the <GAP DESC="foreign">, The <HI>All</HI> that our Tempter can

<P>&sect; 1. To prove the <HI>First</HI> of these Four, [That <HI>the Kingdoms of the Earth,</HI> when they are <HI>All put together,</HI> make but a <HI>glittering Temptation, or handsom Snare,</HI>] we need not argue or dispute from a fitter Topick, than the very signal <HI>Method</HI> the Devil here useth. Who, when he could not cor|rupt our Saviour by all the Miseries of <HI>Want,</HI> did now at last attempt to do it by the boun|tiful Overtures of <HI>Plenty.</HI> Nor can we think he was so <HI>silly,</HI> as not to <HI>rise</HI> in his Temptati|ons, from the less unto the greater. It being for nothing but his <HI>Subtilty,</HI> in con|junction with his <HI>Malice,</HI> that He is call'd <HI>The Old Serpent;</HI> And is said by St. <HI>Iohn,</HI> to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 12. 9.</NOTE> have <HI>deceiv'd the whole World.</HI> And if <HI>the Children of this World are wiser in their kind</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 16. 8.</NOTE> (as our Saviour says they are) <HI>than the Chil|dren of Light,</HI> How much more is their <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">John 8. 44.</NOTE> <HI>Fa|ther,</HI> who for the <HI>Power</HI> of his working, and <HI>Success</HI> of his Policy, is called sometimes <HI>The</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">John 14. 30. John 16. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Prince,</HI> and once <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 4. 4.</NOTE> <HI>The God of this World?</HI>
<PB N="474" REF="245">
Nor is it certainly for Nothing, that <HI>The Devil</HI> has in Scripture such <HI>glorious Titles.</HI> For if we consider the <HI>world of men,</HI> who are divided in their Affections 'twixt <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Satan,</HI> we shall find by their <HI>Actions,</HI> (the best <HI>Interpreters</HI> of their <HI>Hearts</HI>) that the Territories of Satan are much the greater. Our Saviour tells us of a <HI>Broad</HI> way which leadeth to <HI>Destruction,</HI> and <HI>many</HI> there be that go in thereat; whereas (in comparison,) the way to <HI>Life</HI> is but <HI>Narrow,</HI> and They that go thither (he saith) are <HI>few.</HI> And there|fore <HI>Those unclean Spirits</HI> which are expres|sed by St. <HI>Paul</HI> to be <HI>the Spirits now working</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 2. 2.</NOTE> <HI>in the Children of Disobedience,</HI> are but little after call'd by the same Apostle, <HI>The Princi|palities,</HI> and the <HI>Powers,</HI> and (which is more) <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the Rulers of this</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 6. 12.</NOTE> <HI>World.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 2. That thus it is, the Scripture tells us. But some may wonder that thus it <HI>should</HI> be. What may therefore be the <HI>rea|son,</HI> why so <HI>few</HI> should fight manfully under the Banner of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> who therefore said truly, <HI>His Kingdom is not of this World,</HI> And so <HI>many</HI> under <HI>Satan</HI>'s, who thence is
<PB N="475" REF="245">
said to be <HI>the Ruler,</HI> and <HI>the God of this world?</HI> It cannot be because God is more <HI>unwilling</HI> to be obey'd, and <HI>belov'd</HI> by his People, than Satan is. Nor can it be because God did make it <HI>necessary</HI> for Satan, to have a great|er success in the World than Christ. Nor can it be because God is more delighted in the <HI>Damnation,</HI> than the <HI>Salvation</HI> of his Creatures. (He would not fo <HI>gratifie</HI> the Prince of Darkness; nor could his Mercy have been <HI>then</HI> over all his Works.) Nor can it be because Satan is of <HI>more strength</HI> than the Almighty, or more powerful to <HI>corrupt,</HI> than God to <HI>purifie.</HI> For could it consist with God's oeconomy, to work on our <HI>Wills</HI> by That <HI>Omnipotence,</HI> by which the <HI>Wind</HI> and the <HI>Fire</HI> and the <HI>Sea</HI> obey him, we should not be in a <HI>capacity</HI> to break his Praecepts; we should act only as <HI>natural, spontaneous</HI> Agents; and do our Duties as the <HI>Stones</HI> do, in tending <HI>downwards.</HI> Where|as having made us an other Thing, to wit a <HI>rational</HI> sort of Creatures, and that <HI>in vi&acirc;;</HI> not yet arriv'd at our Journeys end, but in a <HI>Tendency</HI> from <HI>Earth,</HI> either to <HI>Heaven,</HI> or to <HI>Hell;</HI> not <HI>indefectibly good,</HI> like the
<PB N="476" REF="246">
Spirits in <HI>Heaven,</HI> nor <HI>consummately evil,</HI> like those in <HI>Hell,</HI> but as it were <GAP DESC="foreign">, in the <HI>Skirts,</HI> or the <HI>Confines</HI> betwixt them Both; to wit <HI>inclinable</HI> to evil, and also <HI>capable</HI> of good; does therefore work upon our <HI>Wills</HI> in a <HI>congruous</HI> manner; in such a manner as is agreeable with the <HI>nature</HI> we are <HI>of,</HI> and with the <HI>condition</HI> we are <HI>in.</HI> Does not press us by any force to <HI>list</HI> our selves in his <HI>Army;</HI> But freely leaves us our option, ei|ther to be <HI>Royalists,</HI> or <HI>Rebels</HI> to him. Nor can it derogate from his Goodness, that he leaves it in our <HI>power</HI> to be <HI>rebellious;</HI> be|cause he gives us <HI>sufficient Grace,</HI> whereby he enables us to <HI>obey.</HI> It is not therefore by a <HI>Fatality</HI> that Satan has got so many Soldiers; but by the <HI>voluntary Defection</HI> of such as serve him. Who cannot say that the Tempter does <HI>irresistibly</HI> debauch them, though with the <HI>Vanities</HI> of the <HI>World</HI> he does <HI>assault</HI> them from <HI>without,</HI> and with the <HI>Treacheries</HI> of the <HI>Flesh</HI> he does <HI>surprise</HI> them from <HI>within.</HI> For the Devil's very <HI>utmost</HI> is but to <HI>tempt</HI> us. And let the <HI>matter</HI> of Temptation be what it will, whether <HI>Honour,</HI> or <HI>Disgrace,</HI> whether <HI>Pain,</HI> or <HI>Pleasure,</HI> whether <HI>Frights,</HI>
<PB N="477" REF="246">
or <HI>Flatteries,</HI> whether <HI>want,</HI> or <HI>superfluity,</HI> or even the same in the Text wherewith he tempted our Blessed Saviour, [<HI>All the King|doms of the Earth, and the Glory of them;</HI>] Yet because by <HI>all These</HI> he can but <HI>solicite,</HI> and <HI>intice</HI> us, we cannot say he does <HI>ravish,</HI> but <HI>court</HI> our Wills. 'Tis true, the Devil is re|presented by many terrible Appellations throughout the Scriptures; as that of <HI>A|baddon,</HI> and <HI>Apollyon,</HI> a <HI>Murderer from the Beginning,</HI> a <HI>Lyon,</HI> and a <HI>Red Dragon,</HI> a <HI>Roaring Lyon,</HI> and a <HI>Serpent.</HI> And in one respect or other he is indeed each of These. But yet he carrys away the <HI>Wills</HI> and <HI>Assents</HI> of men, not as a <HI>Lyon,</HI> only by <HI>Strength;</HI> nor as a <HI>Roaring</HI> one, by <HI>Rapacity;</HI> but ra|ther as a <HI>Serpent,</HI> by <HI>Circumvention.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. Now then let us return to see how the Argument will go on; (having seen e|nough already, upon what foot it stands, and put a Block out of the way too, at which too many are wont to stumble;) can we imagin it to be <HI>likely,</HI> that the old ex|perienced Serpent, <HI>the subtlest Creature under Heaven,</HI> could be so <HI>stupid</HI> and <HI>obtuse</HI> in the Art of Mischief, as to employ his <HI>chief</HI>
<PB N="478" REF="247">
strength upon a Design of <HI>less</HI> importance, and to reserve his <HI>weakest</HI> force for his very <HI>last Onset,</HI> or <HI>Assault?</HI> At first he tempted our Blessed Saviour to nothing else but <HI>Di|strust;</HI> and therefore only made use of his being <HI>hungry,</HI> (v. 3.) Next he tempted him to <HI>Praesumption,</HI> which is the opposite Pro|vocation; and thought it enough for that Effect, to put him in mind of his <HI>Praeroga|tive,</HI> (v. 6.) But now at last he runs high|er, and seeks to bribe the most <HI>righteous Iudge</HI> to the greatest unworthiness in the World, <HI>an Idolizing the unworthiest of all his Creatures.</HI> He knew that Christ was the <HI>Son of God,</HI> because he heard him so de|clared by <HI>God the Father,</HI> (Chap. 3. v. 17.) He also knew the Son of God to be <HI>God the Son</HI> too. And he knew that God the Son was even <HI>the Wisdom of the Father.</HI> And when he would tempt <HI>Wisdom it self</HI> to Ido|lize the very Tempter, he could not but know he was to use the <HI>highest Allective</HI> to be imagin'd. Which by what other means should he hope to do, than by taking up our Lord <HI>to an exceeding high Mountain,</HI> shewing him there, as in a Synopsis, <HI>All the</HI>
<PB N="479" REF="247" MS="y">
<HI>Kingdoms of the World, with the Glory of them,</HI> and then by making this lusty Proffer, <HI>All These will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me?</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 4. This then does lead us to see the reason, why 'tis said by St. <HI>Paul, That the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 6. 10.</NOTE> <HI>love of mony is the Root of all Evil.</HI> And why by St. <HI>Iames, Go to now ye rich men, weep and</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">James 5. 1.</NOTE> <HI>howl for the Miseries that shall come upon you.</HI> And why 'tis said by our Saviour (of whom we believe that he shall come to be our Judge,) <HI>Wo to you that are Rich, for ye have</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 6. 24, 25.</NOTE> <HI>received your Consolation. Wo to you that are full, for ye shall hunger. Wo to you that laugh, for ye shall mourn and weep.</HI> And why 'twas said by the Spanish Friar, That <HI>Few Potentates go to Hell, because</HI> (compa|ratively speaking,) <HI>they All are but Few.</HI> And why we vowed in our Baptism to fight man|fully under Christ's Banner, as well <HI>against the World,</HI> as the Flesh, and the Devil. And why we pray in our publick Litany, not only <HI>In all Time of our Tribulation, of Light|ning and Tempest, of Plague, Pestilence, and Famine, of Battle, and Murder, and suddain Death;</HI> But (as a Danger, if not a Mis|chief,
<PB N="480" REF="248">
as great as either,) <HI>In all Time of our WEALTH, Good Lord deliver us.</HI> Nor can we render a better reason, (as long as <HI>Chari|ty</HI> sits as <HI>Iudge,</HI>) why so many who have been placed <HI>upon exceeding high Mountains,</HI> (a great deal higher even than That on which the Devil here placed our Blessed Saviour,) from whence they could not only <HI>see,</HI> but <HI>injoy</HI> the Kingdoms of the Earth, and the Glory of them, have gladly <HI>laid down</HI> those Kingdoms, and <HI>divorc'd</HI> themselves from those Glories, as having known them by sad experience, to be but <HI>exquisite Temptati|ons,</HI> and <HI>pleasant Snares.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 5. But here I would not be so mista|ken, as our Lord was by his Disciples, when he pronounced it <HI>impossible for a rich man to</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 19. 24.</NOTE> <HI>enter into the Kingdom of God.</HI> For when I say that <HI>worldly Greatness</HI> is one of the De|vil's most cogent Engines, whereby to bat|ter down the <HI>Castle</HI> or <HI>Soul</HI> of Man, I am far from implying 'tis <HI>irresistible.</HI> Though I argue that the Devil is then the greatest <HI>Poliorxetick,</HI> (as Soldiers word it) when he lays Siege to a man's Soul with <HI>All the King|doms of the Earth;</HI> yet can it not therefore
<PB N="481" REF="248">
be deny'd, but that we may beat him out of his Trenches, <HI>through him that strength|neth us;</HI> and that (as He did,) with an <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>get thee hence Satan.</HI> Honour and Riches are but <HI>Temptations;</HI> and Temp|tations <HI>in Themselves</HI> are but Things <HI>Indiffe|rent;</HI> which, accordingly as they are us'd, do administer a Nourishment to <HI>Vice,</HI> or <HI>Vertue.</HI> Just as the very same Sword is of it self apt to serve to the most contrary Effects; as well to <HI>punish,</HI> as to <HI>protect</HI> the Guilty; and either to <HI>defend,</HI> or to <HI>kill</HI> the Innocent. And thus the same <HI>Meat</HI> and <HI>Drink,</HI> as it meets with an <HI>immoderate,</HI> or <HI>sober</HI> Appe|tite, serves for the <HI>Mischief</HI> of a <HI>Surfeit,</HI> or for a <HI>necessary Refection.</HI> The <HI>strength</HI> of a <HI>Temptation,</HI> as it does in part <HI>lessen</HI> the Sin|ner's <HI>Guilt,</HI> when yielded to, and comply'd with; so does it <HI>heighten</HI> the <HI>vertue</HI> too, when <HI>victoriously resisted.</HI> And as the Angels who <HI>fell</HI> from a state of Innocence and Bliss, were the less capable of <HI>rising,</HI> in that they fell <HI>without a Tempter;</HI> so the Angels who <HI>never fell,</HI> are the less capable of the <HI>Coronets</HI> which Virgins and Martyrs shall wear in Heaven, because they are pure, and impassive, and
<PB N="482" REF="249">
so exempted by God Almighty from the Dignity and Privilege of <HI>suffering</HI> for him. This then (we must confess) is the great <HI>Be|nefit</HI> of <HI>Temptations,</HI> (to give our Enemies their Due,) that by resisting them to the end, we <HI>manfully fight</HI> under Christ's <HI>Ban|ner,</HI> conform our selves to his <HI>Example,</HI> and suffer for <HI>his</HI> sake, as He for <HI>ours.</HI> In which respect (no doubt) it was, (as before I no|ted) that St. <HI>Iames</HI> began his Epistle with this remarkable Exhortation, <HI>Brethren count it all Ioy when ye fall into divers Temptations.</HI> Some may <HI>wonder</HI> at the Expression, and think it <HI>impious,</HI> that at the instant in which we pray, <HI>lead us not into Temptation,</HI> we should be <HI>glad</HI> of those things we daily <HI>deprecate.</HI> But St. <HI>Iames</HI> does there speak touching <HI>proportionable</HI> Temptations, such as are not <HI>above our strength;</HI> and are not for the <HI>staggering,</HI> but for the <HI>trial</HI> of our <HI>Faith.</HI> Now the <HI>Trial of our Faith worketh</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">James 1. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Patience, and Patience breeds Hope, and Hope maketh not ashamed.</HI> Again, <HI>The Trial of our Faith shall be found unto praise, and ho|nour, and glory, at the blessed Appearance of Iesus Christ.</HI> If Christ himself had not been

tempted with <HI>all the Kingdoms of the Earth, and the Glory of them,</HI> yea and afterwards too with <HI>Disgrace,</HI> and <HI>Torment,</HI> and <HI>Death it self,</HI> How then could he have <HI>led Captivity Captive?</HI> but for <HI>Injuries,</HI> and <HI>Pains,</HI> where were our <HI>Fortitude,</HI> and <HI>Patience?</HI> were it not for all sorts of <HI>forbidden Fruit,</HI> where were <HI>Continence,</HI> and <HI>Sobriety,</HI> and all other <HI>Abstinencies from Evil?</HI> were it not for <HI>Wealth and Plenty,</HI> where were <HI>Munificence,</HI> and <HI>Works of Mercy?</HI> where the Victories of <HI>Meekness,</HI> and <HI>Moderation,</HI> if there were no such thing as <HI>Glory,</HI> and <HI>worldly Great|ness?</HI> Yea but for <HI>Danger, Destruction,</HI> and <HI>Death it self,</HI> how should we come by our <HI>Immortality?</HI> Our Saviour therefore, when he compar'd a <HI>rich</HI> man's <HI>Entrance</HI> into <HI>Hea|ven,</HI> with the <HI>Entrance</HI> of a <HI>Camel</HI> through<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth 19. 24.</NOTE> the <HI>Eye of a Needle,</HI> did not speak of a <HI>natural,</HI> but of a <HI>moral</HI> Impossibility. For wealthy <HI>Abra|ham</HI> went to Heaven, as well as poor forsaken <HI>Lazarus.</HI> And therefore St. <HI>Mark</HI> does very fitly, (not only <HI>translate,</HI> but) <HI>explain</HI> St. <HI>Matthew;</HI> saying, <HI>How hard;</HI> not, <HI>how Im|possible;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 10. 24.</NOTE> Nor for them that <HI>have</HI> Riches, but for them that <HI>trust in them,</HI> to enter into

Yet even This <HI>Alleviation</HI> may serve to keep them from <HI>Praesumption,</HI> and make them <HI>humble;</HI> because 'tis hard to <HI>have</HI> Riches, and <HI>not</HI> to trust in them. Nor is there any one Thing (that I am able at least to think of) throughout the Gospel, a|gainst which we are admonish'd, praepar'd, and arm'd, with greater store either of <HI>ex|plicit,</HI> or <HI>implicit warnings.</HI> When an inge|nuous young Ruler, whom Jesus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mark 10. 21.</NOTE> lov'd, came to inquire after <HI>Eternity,</HI> and after the <HI>Means</HI> of its Attainment, there was not any thing but his <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Luke 18. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Possessions,</HI> which seem'd to stand betwixt <HI>Him,</HI> and <HI>Heaven.</HI> For when his Oracle had told him, <HI>He must sell all he had, and distribute unto the Poor, he was sad at</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> Qui omnia se fecisse dicebat, in primo certa|mine divitias vincere non po|test. <HI>Hieron. ad Julianum. l. 2.

For when he takes from the <HI>Innocent,</HI> how <HI>liberal</HI> is he to the <HI>Guilty?</HI> It may be said of his Instruments, They do not <HI>always</HI> serve him <HI>for naught.</HI> He often <HI>caresses</HI> them whilst they are <HI>here,</HI> that so <HI>hereafter</HI> he may have liberty to <HI>glut</HI> his <HI>Malice</HI> on them <HI>the more.</HI> What he <HI>snatches</HI> (as 'twere with one hand) from the <HI>Innocent</HI> Party, he commonly <HI>gives</HI> (as with the other) to the <HI>Kennel</HI> of <HI>Robbers</HI>

<P>&sect; 5. Secondly from <HI>Reason</HI> 'twill be as easy to evince it. For if the <HI>Goods</HI> of <HI>this world</HI> were not <HI>suffer'd</HI> by <HI>God</HI> to be disposed of by <HI>the Devil,</HI> our <HI>Leviathan</HI> would have had reason for his <HI>Denial</HI> of any <HI>Difference</HI> 'twixt <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong.</HI> If God <HI>alone</HI> does still dispose of all Possessions under the Sun, (as prosperous Rebels and Usurpers are wont to urge,) and the Devil of none at all by God's permission, <HI>All</HI> things <HI>then</HI> must needs be <HI>right,</HI> except the <HI>Laws</HI> and the <HI>Statutes</HI> which forbid men to steal upon pain of Death. They would not only be <HI>irrational,</HI> but <HI>cruel</HI> things. For why should any man be <HI>censur'd,</HI> (much less certainly should he be <HI>punish't,</HI>) for <HI>taking</HI> That which <HI>God gives</HI> him? Shall not God, without offence, dis|pose of things as He <HI>pleaseth?</HI> why then are we so <HI>wicked,</HI> so <HI>void</HI> of all <HI>Ingenuity,</HI> as to prosecute a Man who is call'd <HI>a Thief,</HI> in case he breaks up our Houses, takes our Cash out
<PB N="536" REF="276">
of our Coffers, drives our Cattle out of our Grounds, or carries our Corn out of our Barns, if <HI>God</HI> has made him <HI>His Messen|ger,</HI> and (by his <HI>absolute Decree,</HI> or by his <HI>All-working Providence,</HI>) <HI>disposed</HI> of our Sub|stance to That man's <HI>use?</HI> Or why did God himself say, <HI>Thou shalt not steal,</HI> if a man can have <HI>nothing,</HI> but what <HI>God gives</HI> him? For whatsoever <HI>God</HI> gives him, becomes his <HI>own.</HI> No <HI>propriety</HI> of <HI>man</HI> can <HI>exclude</HI> that of <HI>God,</HI> or be <HI>equal</HI> to it. And in Con|veyances of Title amongst <HI>our selves,</HI> still (we know) a Deed of <HI>Gift,</HI> confers as abso|lute a <HI>Right,</HI> as a Deed of <HI>Purchase.</HI> If then we may have any thing which by right is not <HI>ours,</HI> we have it certainly from <HI>Satan,</HI> and not from <HI>God.</HI> For one of These Members fol|lowing (that I may make my work short) must needs be granted. Either that Rob|bery, and Theft, Extorsion, and Oppressi|on, and all sorts of Cousenage, are <HI>names,</HI> and <HI>words,</HI> and <HI>nothing else;</HI> (invented only by Politicians, Ecclesiastical and Civil,) or that if they are <HI>Things,</HI> they are very <HI>Good,</HI> as being derived from <HI>God the Author;</HI> or that God is the Author of what is <HI>morally evil;</HI>
<PB N="537" REF="276">
or that at least they are the <HI>works,</HI> not of <HI>God,</HI> but of the <HI>Devil.</HI> The First of these cannot be; for then it would follow, That <HI>Theft is no Sin.</HI> Much less the Second; for then it would follow, <HI>that Sin is Good.</HI> Much less the Third; for then it would follow, <HI>that God is Evil.</HI> Each of which being <HI>false,</HI> and <HI>blasphemous</HI> too; 'Tis plain the Fourth, by way of Refuge, must needs be granted, (seeing no fifth Member can either <HI>be,</HI> or be <HI>imagin'd,</HI>) That <HI>All our Robberies and Frauds are not of God, but of the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 6. Now this becomes a sure Medium to prove the Point we have in hand; because the Things of this world (I mean the <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of it) are wont to be bandied up and down, from one Possessor to another, by secret Fraud, or by open Force. How ve|ry <HI>few</HI> (in comparison) are <HI>contented</HI> with the Portion which God has given them? and have no more in their Possession than can be properly call'd <HI>Theirs?</HI> How much is got|ten by daily <HI>cousenage,</HI> in Fairs, or Markets? How much by <HI>filtching,</HI> and <HI>purloyning,</HI> in private Families, and Common Fields? How much by <HI>Bribery,</HI> and <HI>Corruption,</HI> in

How much by <HI>Preaching,</HI> and <HI>length of Praying,</HI> when Pharisaical Negotiators do pray and preach <HI>for a Pretence,</HI> that they may <HI>swallow down Orphans and Widows Houses?</HI> How much by <HI>Riots</HI> and <HI>Depredations</HI> of un|disciplin'd Armies, through <HI>the Spirit which</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 2. 2.</NOTE> <HI>is still working in the Children of Disobedience?</HI> In a word, I am not qualified to name the several ways and methods, by which Inju|stice is promoted, and Equity trodden into the Dust. Now whatsoever is <HI>ill-acquired</HI> cannot possibly be our <HI>own,</HI> however call'd by <HI>our Names.</HI> For <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Possession</HI> are many times at such Distance, that they can never once <HI>meet,</HI> or be <HI>reconcil'd.</HI> Yea by how much the nearer <HI>Possession</HI> is, <HI>Right</HI> may stand the farther off.

<P>&sect; 13.

this World are <HI>Deliver'd</HI> to him. For <HI>not to hinder</HI> or to <HI>permit,</HI> or to <HI>suffer</HI> him to take and dispose of Things, is very much <HI>less</HI> than to <HI>deliver,</HI> or <HI>put</HI> them to him to dis|pose of; even as much as to be <HI>passive,</HI> must needs be <HI>less</HI> than to be <HI>active,</HI> in whatsoever thing it is which is brought to pass. 'Tis true, the Devil was permitted <HI>to</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Matth. 4. 5, 8.</NOTE> <HI>take</HI> our <HI>Saviour,</HI> not only <HI>once,</HI> but <HI>again;</HI> and to <HI>carry</HI> him whither he <HI>pleas'd</HI> too; as first <HI>in|to The City,</HI> and after That <HI>unto The Moun|tain.</HI> But 'tis false to say, our Saviour was <HI>deliver'd</HI> up to Satan by God the Father. Next 'tis but figuratively true, and therefore literally false, That he <HI>gives</HI> the World's King|doms <HI>to such as serve him.</HI> For being no more than an <HI>Usurper,</HI> and therefore <HI>void</HI> of all <HI>right,</HI> he is not <HI>properly</HI> said to <HI>Give,</HI> but ra|ther to <HI>procure</HI> them to all <HI>Usurpers.</HI> Third|ly 'tis <HI>false</HI> that he procures them <HI>to whomsoe|ver he pleaseth,</HI> (which yet he confidently adds,) for he procures them <HI>no farther,</HI> than God sees good to <HI>permit,</HI> or <HI>suffer.</HI> Last of all he saith <HI>falsly,</HI> That <HI>ALL</HI> the Kingdoms of the World and the Glory of them are so much as <HI>permitted</HI> to his Disposal, (if he
<PB N="557" REF="286" MS="y">
means all at once.) For <HI>God</HI> disposeth of <HI>many</HI> Kingdoms, wherein he suffers not <HI>the Devil</HI> to have the least thing to do. 'Twas <HI>God alone</HI> who gave his People the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> although <HI>the Devil</HI> took it from Them, and helpt to procure it for the <HI>As|syrians.</HI> 'Twas <HI>God alone</HI> who gave <HI>Iob</HI> his <HI>store</HI> of <HI>Cattle,</HI> although <HI>the Devil</HI> prompted his <HI>Labourers,</HI> (the <HI>Chaldaeans</HI> and <HI>Sabaeans,</HI>) to take them from him. 'Twas <HI>God alone</HI> who gave <HI>Naboth</HI> a pleasant <HI>Vineyard,</HI> al|though <HI>the Devil</HI> (by God's permission) helpt <HI>Ahab</HI> to it. 'Twas <HI>God alone</HI> who gave a Kingdom, (or rather <HI>Three Kingdoms</HI> which made a <HI>World,</HI>) together with all the <HI>Glory of it,</HI> to our late <HI>Martyr'd Soveraign</HI> of Glori|ous Memory, although <HI>the Devil</HI> was <HI>per|mitted</HI> (by the <HI>help</HI> of his Tools) to <HI>bereave</HI> him of it. In a word, if it is <HI>true,</HI> what is proverbially asserted, (and upon very good Grounds,) That <HI>half</HI> the World, <HI>at the least,</HI> does live by <HI>cheating</HI> all <HI>the rest,</HI> and by imposing on <HI>one another;</HI> Then is it easy to discern and to state the <HI>Difference,</HI> betwixt the <HI>Right,</HI> and the <HI>Possession</HI> of things on Earth; betwixt the <HI>Blessings,</HI> and the <HI>Curses</HI>

<P>&sect; 14. Having hitherto shew'd the <HI>Truth</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Reasons offer'd.</NOTE> of my Proposition, and withal <HI>clear'd</HI> it from the <HI>Objection;</HI> I am next to give the <HI>Reasons,</HI> (at least as many as I can think of, or can fairly conjecture at,) why God is pleas'd, in this World, to indure with so much <HI>patience</HI> so great a <HI>confusion</HI> upon the Earth, and leaves to the Devil so great a <HI>power</HI> in the perverting and debauching the ways of men. For whilst we look at nothing else but what is <HI>present,</HI> and <HI>before</HI> us, we seem to see nothing but <HI>Disorder,</HI> in most Events under the Sun. If none but <HI>good</HI> men did <HI>prosper,</HI> and none but <HI>evil</HI> men <HI>miscarry,</HI> A <HI>method</HI> then would be acknowledg'd, and men would probably be <HI>better</HI> than <HI>now</HI> they are. Of if <HI>all</HI> that are <HI>good</HI> were in <HI>Affliction,</HI> and <HI>all</HI> that are <HI>evil</HI> in <HI>Prosperity,</HI> still there would be some <HI>method,</HI> however men in pro|bability would be very much the <HI>worse</HI> for the knowledge of it. But as now the world goes, There seems to be <HI>no method at all.</HI> Things fall out in such a <HI>blended promiscu|ous</HI>
<PB N="559" REF="287">
manner. For though the <HI>wicked</HI> are found to prosper a great deal more than the <HI>righteous,</HI> (as has been shew'd,) yet 'tis as clear that many <HI>righteous</HI> do also prosper <HI>with</HI> the <HI>wicked,</HI> and many <HI>wicked</HI> ones, even <HI>here,</HI> are as much afflicted as the <HI>righ|teous.</HI> In which respect it was said by the Royal Preacher, That <HI>all things come alike</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 9. 2, 3, 11.</NOTE> <HI>to all. There is one event to the wicked, and to the righteous; to the clean, and to the un|clean, to him that sacrificeth, and him that sa|crificeth not. As is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an Oath. The Race is not to the swift, nor the Battle to the strong, neither Bread to the Wise, nor Riches to men of Understanding, nor yet Favour to men of Skill, but Time and Chance happeneth to them all.</HI> In so much that some are <HI>tempt|ed</HI> by the seeming <HI>Confusion</HI> of <HI>Events,</HI> the <HI>Prosperities</HI> of the <HI>worst</HI> men, and the <HI>Calami|ties</HI> of the <HI>Best,</HI> to <HI>distrust</HI> the very <HI>Provi|dence,</HI> yea to <HI>suspect</HI> the very <HI>Iustice,</HI> yea to <HI>deny</HI> the very <HI>Being</HI> of God Himself.

<P><PB N="560" REF="288">&sect; 15. Now to preserve our selves from <HI>falling</HI> into the very same <HI>Snare,</HI> let us reflect upon the <HI>Reasons</HI> of this <HI>Confusion,</HI> at which so many are falling headlong into the bot|tomless Abyss of Eternal Misery. Not <HI>in|sisting</HI> upon the <HI>Reasons</HI> in such a measure as they deserve, But rather pointing at the chief <HI>Topicks</HI> from which the <HI>Reasons</HI> are to be <HI>fetch't.</HI> One chief Reason is to be taken from the natural <HI>Freedom</HI> of the <HI>Will,</HI> in e|very rational Agent which is subjected to a <HI>Law,</HI> and by consequence made worthy ei|ther of <HI>Punishment</HI> or <HI>Reward.</HI> God's way of <HI>working</HI> upon the <HI>Will</HI> is exactly <HI>suitable</HI> to its <HI>Nature,</HI> and therefore agreeable to its <HI>Freedom;</HI> tending to <HI>rectifie,</HI> but not <HI>destroy</HI> it; and by consequence to <HI>incline,</HI> but not <HI>compell</HI> it. Were <HI>All</HI> the workings of the Almighty in full proportion to his <HI>Almighti|ness,</HI> and therefore always, on all occasions, as <HI>irresistible,</HI> as they are <HI>Good,</HI> I cannot see how it were <HI>possible</HI> for any Creature to do <HI>amiss;</HI> or how an <HI>Action</HI> could be other|wise, than <HI>God</HI> would <HI>have</HI> it. Nor can I see how 'twould be possible to give a tolera|ble reason, why <HI>several</HI> men at the <HI>same time,</HI>
<PB N="561" REF="288" MS="y">
and the <HI>same</HI> men at <HI>several</HI> times, are either <HI>better,</HI> or <HI>worse,</HI> than <HI>Themselves,</HI> or <HI>others.</HI> Why <HI>Iohn</HI> was better than <HI>Iudas,</HI> or <HI>Paul</HI> better than <HI>Himself.</HI> Better (I mean) when he <HI>asserted,</HI> than when he <HI>persecuted</HI> the Church. It follows therefore that the <HI>man|ner</HI> of God's Impression upon <HI>the Will</HI> can|not be <HI>cogent,</HI> and <HI>irresistible,</HI> but so <HI>congru|ous</HI> rather and <HI>suitable,</HI> as still to let it re|main <HI>a Will.</HI> And therefore he works upon it otherwise, than he works upon <HI>irrational</HI> and <HI>sensless</HI> Creatures; to wit by <HI>Promises,</HI> and <HI>Threats,</HI> by <HI>Exhortations,</HI> and <HI>Praecepts,</HI> and these in conjunction with a competent measure of his <HI>Grace;</HI> which Agents <HI>natural,</HI> and <HI>involuntary</HI> (such as Vegetables, and Brutes,) are not susceptible of. Now God <HI>determin'd</HI> from all Eternity <HI>not to hinder</HI> from being <HI>done,</HI> what he eternally <HI>foreknew</HI> the <HI>congruous means</HI> I now mention'd would not prevail with <HI>wilful Creatures,</HI> so as to <HI>hinder</HI> them from <HI>doing.</HI> For why should <HI>He</HI> by his <HI>Omnipotence</HI> controul the <HI>Wills</HI> of those Creatures, whom both his <HI>Promises,</HI> and his <HI>Threats,</HI> his <HI>Miracles,</HI> and his <HI>Laws,</HI> and a <HI>competent</HI> measure of his <HI>Grace,</HI> have been
<PB N="562" REF="289" MS="y">
so <HI>thanklesly</HI> and <HI>vainly</HI> bestow'd upon? When he cannot restrain our <HI>Wills</HI> by means <HI>agreeable</HI> to our <HI>Natures,</HI> or by any <HI>lesser</HI> means than what are <HI>destructive</HI> to our <HI>Wills,</HI> and by consequence to our <HI>Natures,</HI> (which he eternally <HI>determined</HI> he would <HI>not violate,</HI>) How very <HI>justly</HI> must he needs <HI>suffer</HI> the <HI>worst</HI> of <HI>Actions,</HI> which withal he does <HI>direct</HI> to the <HI>best</HI> of <HI>Ends?</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 16. Another Reason is to be taken from the <HI>corrigible</HI> Condition of <HI>some Evil Doers,</HI> whom God is pleased to bless and prosper with many Temporal Injoyments, thereby to <HI>mollifie,</HI> and <HI>indear,</HI> and as it were <HI>over|come</HI> them with so much kindness. A great deal of Love and Longanimity will be e|nough to <HI>melt</HI> the Heart of the <HI>hardest</HI> Ene|my, if there is <HI>any Wax</HI> left in his Compo|sition; if there is <HI>any good nature</HI> abiding in him. And such was the Method touching which St. <HI>Paul</HI> speaks in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans; Despisest thou the Riches of his Good|ness and Forbearance and Long-suffering, not knowing that the Goodness of God leadeth thee to Repentance?</HI> When God is pleas'd to plant<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 5. 2, 4.</NOTE> his <HI>Vineyard</HI> upon a very <HI>fruitful Hill,</HI> to

make a strong <HI>fence about it,</HI> to <HI>gather out the stones,</HI> to <HI>build a Tower in the midst,</HI> and to <HI>make a Wine-press,</HI> what can he mean but to <HI>ingage</HI> it, to yield him <HI>Grapes</HI> in <HI>proportion</HI> to all his <HI>Culture?</HI> And he appeals to the Inhabitants of <HI>Ierusalem and Iudah,</HI> whether more could be done than he had done unto his <HI>Vineyard,</HI> what could he signifie but his Indeavours, <HI>to overcome evil with doing good?</HI> Thus God draws near to <HI>us</HI> in <HI>Mercies,</HI> that we may also draw near to <HI>Him,</HI> in the <HI>Amend|ment</HI> of our Lives and our Conversations.</P>
<P>&sect; 17. A Third Reason is to be taken from the <HI>Incorrigible</HI> Condition of <HI>another</HI> sort of Evil Doers, whom God is <HI>pleas'd</HI> to <HI>give over,</HI> as Physicians use to do their <HI>de|sperate</HI> Patients. They being a sort of Peo|ple, who are <HI>in love</HI> with their Diseases, and cannot <HI>indure</HI> to be reform'd, and therefore <HI>kick</HI> at the means of Cure. God leaves such as <HI>these</HI> to their own Hearts Lust, and lets them <HI>wallow</HI> (like so many <HI>Swine</HI>) in the <HI>Mire</HI> of Temporal Felicities. For as Those very Swine are ever suffer'd to <HI>fare</HI> the <HI>best,</HI> that is, to injoy the <HI>richest feeding,</HI> which are most of all designed for <HI>Sale</HI> and <HI>Slaughter;</HI> so
<PB N="564" REF="290">
God indures with much long-suffering the Vessels of Wrath, to <HI>wax fat</HI> with all their Contentments and Sensualities, because by such their Injoyments they fit themselves for <HI>Destruction.</HI> To allow them the <HI>benefit</HI> of his <HI>Rod,</HI> were to deal with them as <HI>Sons;</HI> which why should he do, whilst they only deal with him as <HI>rebellious Servants?</HI> Suppose our <HI>Sheep</HI> and our <HI>Oxen</HI> were able to <HI>reason</HI> amongst themselves, and understood the re|al <HI>End</HI> for which they are turn'd into their <HI>Pastures,</HI> would they not <HI>macerate</HI> their Bo|dies, and bring their Flesh into <HI>Subjection,</HI> by a great deal of <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Self-denial,</HI> and be <HI>afraid</HI> of faring well, at least in this consideration, that the <HI>fatter</HI> they grow, they grow the fitter for the <HI>Shambles,</HI> and that the <HI>leaner</HI> they are, they are suffer'd to <HI>live</HI> so much the <HI>longer?</HI> Much the same is <HI>Their</HI> Case, who <HI>defile themselves as brute Beasts,</HI> (to use the Comparison of St. <HI>Iude.</HI>) A Comparison <HI>not odious,</HI> because 'tis made by the <HI>Holy Ghost:</HI> who saith of Them that are permitted to <HI>live</HI> and <HI>prosper</HI> in their <HI>Im|pieties,</HI> That <HI>they are</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Rom. 9. 22.</NOTE> <HI>fitted for Destruction;</HI> and <HI>prepar'd, like</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Jer. 12. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Sheep, for the day of</HI>

<P>&sect; 18.

of the seeming Disorder and Confusi|on in the promiscuous Distribution of all Possessions under the Sun, There may be o|ther Reasons given by considering men, and there are doubtless many others which are known to <HI>God only:</HI> and which cannot be better collected than from the Example of our Saviour, on whom the Devil and his In|struments were permitted to have so great a Power.

<PB N="573" REF="294">
<HI>Patience, and wise Permission, in the Devil's Power and Disposal.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 21. After the <HI>Truth,</HI> and the <HI>Reason,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Applicati|on.</NOTE> let us observe the special <HI>Uses</HI> which may be made of his Doctrin. First it teacheth us how to value the <HI>beggarly Greatness</HI> of this World. Over-value it we <HI>may,</HI> and very commonly we do too; but undervalue it we <HI>cannot,</HI> do what we can. For what more <HI>despicable</HI> than <HI>That,</HI> which the <HI>Devil</HI> can both <HI>procure,</HI> and <HI>deprive</HI> us of? What more <HI>worthy</HI> of our <HI>Contempt,</HI> than what is <HI>so un|dervalued</HI> by Him that made it, as by Him to be often <HI>left</HI> in the <HI>Devil's Power</HI> and <HI>Dis|posal?</HI> The Devil can <HI>give</HI> us great Posses|sions, just as he <HI>gave</HI> them to the <HI>Chaldae|ans;</HI> And can <HI>take them away,</HI> as he did from <HI>Iob.</HI> For both which reasons we ought to <HI>scorn</HI> them, and to behave our selves towards them as things <HI>below</HI> us; fit for nothing but to be matter, whereby to <HI>exercise</HI> a <HI>Bounty</HI> to such as <HI>want</HI> them.</P>
<P>First (I say) 'tis a <HI>disparagement</HI> to the <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of the World, that they are left so much by God in the <HI>Devil's Power,</HI>
<PB N="574" REF="295">
that <HI>Satan</HI> is suffer'd to bestow them on such as <HI>serve</HI> him. For the Gifts of the De|vil are never <HI>Good,</HI> nor consistent with <HI>Good|ness</HI> in such as have them. They are disho|nourable, and dangerous, and Hostages gi|ven to Destruction. The Devil can give <HI>Riches,</HI> (in the sense before mention'd,) but not <HI>Contentment,</HI> and <HI>a right use,</HI> which are the ends for which we crave them. And for want of which ends, they increase our Po|verty. For as, when the <HI>Body</HI> of man is <HI>Aguish,</HI> no Addition of <HI>Clothes</HI> can make him <HI>warm;</HI> So when the <HI>Soul</HI> of man is <HI>vitious,</HI> no Addition of <HI>Treasure</HI> can make him <HI>rich.</HI> The reason of which Paradox may thus be illustrated, and clear'd. We know that though the <HI>Clothes</HI> defend the Body from <HI>outward Cold,</HI> yet 'tis the Body's <HI>inward Heat</HI> which does <HI>warm</HI> the <HI>Clothes:</HI> For else a Coffin and a Coverlid would warm a man when he is dead. Which being evidently impossible, 'Tis plain that the Body must warm the Clothes, before the Clothes can warm the Body. And thence a <HI>Child</HI> is much warmer in a very <HI>thin Suit,</HI> than his old decrepit <HI>Father</HI> when wrapt about with
<PB N="575" REF="295">
a <HI>Wardrope.</HI> In like manner 'tis the <HI>Soul</HI> which makes the <HI>Possession</HI> become <HI>sufficient,</HI> not at all the <HI>Possession</HI> which gives <HI>content|ment</HI> unto the <HI>Soul.</HI> And as the way where|by to cure the <HI>cold Access</HI> of an <HI>Ague,</HI> is to <HI>cleanse</HI> the Body from peccant humours, not to bring it to a great <HI>Fire;</HI> so the way to be <HI>happy</HI> as well as full, is to <HI>purge</HI> an over pas|sionate and sickly <HI>Soul,</HI> not to rake up a great <HI>Estate.</HI> There are indeed who have <HI>Abundance</HI> in conjunction with <HI>Satisfaction;</HI> But 'tis clear their Satisfaction does not arise from <HI>That</HI> Abundance. For if Content|ment could grow from Plenty, The Man of <HI>Macedon</HI> had been satisfied in his <HI>Acquist</HI> of all <HI>Asia;</HI> and had not <HI>wept</HI> for <HI>another World.</HI> Nor would They who at first do take up Arms for <HI>meer Liberty&punc;</HI> continue the keeping of them up for <HI>meer Dominion,</HI> (when they have got their <HI>own</HI> Liberty, they would not take it from <HI>other men.</HI>) From whence it fol|lows, That no man living is <HI>contented,</HI> meer|ly because he has <HI>enough,</HI> But that many men have <HI>enough,</HI> meerly because they are <HI>con|tented.</HI> And as a man in a <HI>Boat,</HI> when he would pull the <HI>Bank</HI> to him, finds it impos|sible
<PB N="576" REF="296">
for him to do it, but by pulling <HI>Him|self</HI> upon the <HI>Bank;</HI> so the only way possible to fit our <HI>Condition</HI> to our <HI>minds,</HI> is by bringing our <HI>minds</HI> to our <HI>Condition.</HI> For if a man shall inlarge his Desires as Hell, and is as greedy as the Grave, All the Possessions in the World will not fill one of his <HI>Eyes.</HI> 'Twas very shrewdly said by <HI>Socrates</HI> to <HI>Ar|chelaus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrat.

<P>Much <HI>less</HI> reason have we to <HI>boast,</HI> in what the <HI>Devil</HI> can <HI>take away</HI> too; in being <HI>Te|nants at Will</HI> to so vile a <HI>Landlord.</HI> There is nothing more usual with <HI>the Prince of this World,</HI> than to set <HI>Pilate</HI> against <HI>Herod,</HI> as well as <HI>Both</HI> against <HI>Christ.</HI> He employs <HI>one</HI> Robber in offering violence to <HI>another.</HI> And who would care for those Riches which on|ly make him the Devil's <HI>Sumpter?</HI> Can we think it a noble thing, to be <HI>laden</HI> with <HI>thick Clay</HI> at the Devil's <HI>Pleasure,</HI> and again <HI>unla|den</HI> at his <HI>Command?</HI> To have Wealth be|stow'd on us by <HI>our</HI> Complyance with the Tempter, and taken from us by <HI>other men's?</HI> 'Twas wisely done of <HI>Aristippus,</HI> the learn|ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Socrat.

The <HI>Devil</HI> and his <HI>Agents,</HI> are often permitted to do the <HI>former;</HI> But <HI>God alone,</HI> and his <HI>Embassa|dours,</HI> will oblige us so far as to do the <HI>later.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 22. Secondly let us consider, That since we find <HI>God Himself</HI> bestowing Riches upon <HI>some,</HI> as upon <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>Iob,</HI> or whosoever has a <HI>right</HI> to the several things which he possesseth; whilst <HI>the Devil</HI> gives to <HI>others,</HI> (by God's Permission) as to the <HI>Sabaeans,</HI> and the <HI>Chaldaeans,</HI> who plunder'd <HI>Iob</HI> of his Substance; to <HI>Achan,</HI> and <HI>Ahab,</HI> or whosoever has <HI>Possession</HI> without a right; It concerns us to <HI>examin</HI> the exact <HI>Derivati|on</HI> of our Estates; and to have it well stated,
<PB N="579" REF="297">
whether we receive them from <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>Sa|tan.</HI> For if <HI>honestly</HI> acquir'd, and so from <HI>God,</HI> (by his Appointment, and Approbati|on,) Then we may honestly <HI>injoy</HI> them, to the <HI>Glory</HI> of God, and our private <HI>Comfort.</HI> Always bearing This in mind, That we are but God's <HI>Almoners,</HI> or <HI>Usufructuaries;</HI> and must dispense to His Members who is <HI>Pro|prietary in chief.</HI> But if <HI>dishonestly</HI> attain'd to, and so from <HI>Satan,</HI> (by God's <HI>permission</HI> only, and <HI>sufferance,</HI>) we cannot honestly <HI>possess,</HI> much less <HI>injoy</HI> them, and therefore ought to do <HI>neither</HI> to God's <HI>Dishonour,</HI> and our <HI>Damnation.</HI> But as our Saviour hath said of the <HI>Eye,</HI> and <HI>Hand,</HI> That if at any time they offend us, we must <HI>pluck out</HI> the one, and <HI>cut off</HI> the other; so must we say of our <HI>Possessions,</HI> That if they <HI>offend</HI> us in the like sense, by making us <HI>stumble into Sin,</HI> we must <HI>pluck them</HI> out of our Treasury, (like the Emperour <HI>Sigismund,</HI>) and (like <HI>Him</HI> too) <HI>cast them from us;</HI> because 'tis bet|ter for us to <HI>enter</HI> as Poor as <HI>Lazarus</HI> into <HI>Heaven,</HI> than remaining Rich as <HI>Dives,</HI> to be cast into <HI>Hell.</HI> Always keeping This in memory, That Ill-gotten Goods may pur|chase

<P>&sect; 23.

<P>&sect; 2. Hereupon we are to argue <HI>&agrave; minori ad majus.</HI> If the best <HI>Mens</HI> Gifts are so Im|perfect, what then are <HI>Satan's,</HI> who (be|sides
<PB N="589" REF="302">
that He has not a <HI>right</HI> to give,) does sell his Gifts for Mens <HI>Souls?</HI> Things so in|finitely precious, that <HI>Christ Himself</HI> could not <HI>buy</HI> them, but with his <HI>Blood.</HI> When our Souls were to be <HI>purchas't</HI> from Sin and Hell, the Son of God being Incarnate could not have given <HI>enough</HI> for them, if He had not vouchsafed to <HI>give Himself.</HI> Now 'tis the <HI>Avarice</HI> of Satan, (and his <HI>Ambition</HI> at the same instant,) to <HI>buy</HI> our Souls back un|to Sin and Misery, although he <HI>bids</HI> no more for them, than the pitiful Allectives of <HI>Wealth,</HI> and <HI>Greatness; The Kingdoms of the Earth, and the Glory of them.</HI> And well it were, if it were no worse. For, besides that he offers a great deal more than he <HI>can give,</HI> (he being ever God's <HI>Pris'ner,</HI> as hath been shewn,) the saddest part of it is, that however <HI>his biddings</HI> are on the <HI>Earth,</HI> his general <HI>Payments</HI> are still in <HI>Hell.</HI> All his Gifts do still flow from his Desire of such Gain. He reacheth his <HI>offers</HI> to us with <HI>one</HI> hand, that he may <HI>plunder</HI> us with the <HI>other.</HI> His liberality to <HI>us,</HI> is like the Fisherman's to the <HI>River;</HI> who in Case he does cast in a worthless <HI>Fly,</HI> 'tis that the
<PB N="590" REF="303">
River may requite Him with some good <HI>Fish.</HI> When Satan offers us any favours, we must immediately consider he is but <HI>Ang|ling</HI> after our <HI>Souls.</HI> He baits his <HI>Hook</HI> with <HI>worldly Greatness,</HI> that whilst we <HI>catch</HI> at the <HI>one,</HI> we may be <HI>caught</HI> with the other; and, like silly Fishes indeed, may greedily <HI>swallow</HI> our own <HI>Destruction.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; 3. Thus the Things which we call the Gifts of Satan, we find by experience we do but <HI>call</HI> so. They are <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Gifts and no Gifts. Munera inescata, Baits of Bounty.</HI> Such a <HI>Condition</HI> is interpos'd betwixt the <HI>Proffer,</HI> and the <HI>Performance,</HI> as makes the Donative far worse than <HI>Nothing. His Con|dition</HI> does evacuate and null his <HI>Offer.</HI> For what he said unto our <HI>Saviour,</HI> (without a Proxy,) he saith (by his <HI>Instruments</HI>) to each of <HI>us, All these things will I give thee, if falling down thou wilt worship me.</HI> Which is as much as to say, all shall be thine with this Proviso, that thou wilt take a sure Course to be <HI>no whit the better,</HI> but much the <HI>worse</HI> for their Injoyment. Thou shalt be <HI>Rich</HI> at this present, if for the future thou wilt be <HI>ruin'd.</HI> Thou shalt have all the World at
<PB N="591" REF="303">
will, but thou shalt have it upon Condition, that thou turn <HI>Idolater,</HI> and <HI>be damn'd.</HI> And what is this better than to say, I will give Thee very <HI>freely</HI> a great Estate, upon Condi|tion thou wilt <HI>pay</HI> me a thousand times <HI>more</HI> than <HI>it is worth,</HI> and also make thy self <HI>inca|pable</HI> of its <HI>Injoyment.</HI> I will shew thee the ready way, not to <HI>Liberty</HI> only, but <HI>Empire,</HI> upon Condition thou wilt <HI>serve</HI> me, and be a <HI>Slave.</HI> I will lift thee <HI>up,</HI> if thou wilt cast thy self <HI>down.</HI> Thus does the Devil speak Contradictions; And the <HI>Proviso</HI> with which he <HI>proffers</HI> does make the proffer of <HI>none ef|fect.</HI> Like those Beasts in the Apologue, which offer'd the Lyon to be their <HI>King,</HI> if he would but permit them to cut his <HI>Claws.</HI> They would admit Him to <HI>Reign,</HI> and to <HI>triumph</HI> over them, if he would do them the favour to <HI>disable</HI> himself for the Prefer|ment. Thus the Devil either presents us with empty <HI>Proffers</HI> rather than <HI>Gifts,</HI> with flattering <HI>Hopes,</HI> not true <HI>Possessions;</HI> or if He really indows us, he does it only to our undoing. If he helps us to Wit, 'tis that we may wickedly lay it out in speaking <HI>jest|ingly</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 4. 9.</NOTE> of <HI>Scripture,</HI> and merrily <HI>drolling</HI> upon
<PB N="592" REF="304">
<HI>Religion</HI> to make Men <HI>laugh.</HI> If he helps us to <HI>Beauty,</HI> it is to raise up <HI>Self-love;</HI> that we may use it, like wanton <HI>Iezebel,</HI> for a Snare, and a Temptation, and that to di|vers most <HI>foolish and hurtful Lusts, which drown the Soul in Misery and Perdition.</HI> If to <HI>Secular Greatness,</HI> it is to betray us to <HI>Self-Relyance;</HI> and break our <HI>Necks</HI> from that <HI>Ladder</HI> by which we <HI>mounted&punc;</HI> If he helps us with <HI>Mony</HI> by any means, it is but just as <HI>old Gamesters</HI> do lend their cash to <HI>young Heirs,</HI> that they may <HI>lose</HI> it with them <HI>at play.</HI> Or as <HI>Harlots</HI> lend Mony unto their prodigal <HI>Gallants,</HI> that when they have <HI>spent</HI> it upon their <HI>Lusts,</HI> They with whom they have spent it, may <HI>Sue the Bond.</HI> Or as some supply <HI>Madmen</HI> with <HI>Knives</HI> and <HI>Halters,</HI> that either they may <HI>strangle,</HI> or <HI>stab</HI> themselves. How <HI>sweet</HI> soever the Gifts of Satan may seem to be at the <HI>beginning,</HI> yet their <HI>end</HI> and <HI>design|ment</HI> is still as <HI>bitter</HI> as <HI>Destruction.</HI> When he carried up our Saviour unto a <HI>Pinnacle of the Temple,</HI> (an high Preferment,) <HI>v.</HI> 5. it was to this end, that he might <HI>cast himself head|long,</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 6.)

end, that he might presently <HI>fall down,</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 9.) Just as when an <HI>Eagle</HI> has found an <HI>Oyster,</HI> he takes it up into the <HI>Clouds,</HI> that he may give it by so much the <HI>greater fall,</HI> and that by breaking the <HI>Shell,</HI> he may eat the <HI>Fish.</HI> In a word, we may resemble the <HI>Gifts</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> to the monstrous <HI>Locusts</HI> from out <HI>the bottomless Pit;</HI> which though<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 9. 2, 7, 8, 18.</NOTE> they had on their <HI>Heads</HI> (as it were) <HI>Crowns of Gold,</HI> and <HI>Faces</HI> like <HI>those of Men,</HI> and goodly <HI>Hair</HI> like <HI>that of Women,</HI> yet their <HI>Teeth</HI> all the while were as the <HI>Teeth of Ly|ons,</HI> and <HI>the Stings in their Tails</HI> like <HI>those of Scorpions.</HI></P>

were not true and real <HI>Givers</HI> of their Thirty pieces of Silver, but only parted with them to <HI>Iudas</HI> to <HI>buy</HI> his <HI>Loyalty;</HI> that having once sold <HI>That,</HI> he might sell his <HI>Lord</HI> too. Again, after this, <HI>they gave large</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 28. 12.</NOTE> <HI>mony unto the Souldiers,</HI> whom they had set on full purpose to watch the Sepulcher of Christ. Yet did they not do it in <HI>generosity,</HI> or with any design of the Soldiers <HI>good,</HI> but only <HI>brib'd</HI> them to tell <HI>a Lye:</HI> To wit <HI>that</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 18.</NOTE> <HI>whilst they were sleeping, Christ was stoln out of his Grave.</HI> Queen <HI>Iezebel</HI> (no doubt) did send a <HI>Present</HI> very <HI>considerable</HI> to the <HI>two Sons of Belial;</HI> but it does not thence fol|low that she was <HI>liberally-minded;</HI> for she only meant to <HI>hire</HI> them to <HI>bear false witness,</HI> and thereby to requite her with <HI>Naboth's</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Kings 21. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Vineyard.</HI> So we know that <HI>Simon Magus</HI> was very <HI>free</HI> of his <HI>Mony,</HI> but 'twas to <HI>buy</HI> the famous <HI>Gift</HI> of the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> and this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 8. 18, 19, 20.</NOTE> to the end that he might <HI>sell</HI> it to whomso|ever he should please. We must be there|fore very <HI>wary,</HI> when any offers are made <HI>us</HI> by any <HI>Emissaries</HI> of Satan, both <HI>what</HI> is offer'd, and <HI>by whom,</HI> and to <HI>what Intent</HI> it is <HI>directed.</HI> We must beware of <HI>their</HI> offers,

who shall offer us <HI>That</HI> which is <HI>none of Theirs,</HI> (as the Devil here did,) and we must mark the <HI>Condition on which the offer is made.</HI> As whether it is not to ingage us in <HI>Schism,</HI> or <HI>Sacrilege;</HI> whether it is not to make us Partners in any <HI>Conspiracy,</HI> or <HI>Faction,</HI> that we may <HI>worship</HI> and <HI>fall down</HI> to something else besides God. Suppose a Man shall take thee up (whosoever thou art who now dost read what I am writing) unto some Pinnacle of the Temple, or some exceeding high Mountain, and shall discover to thee (from thence) some very excellent <HI>Seat</HI> which is <HI>none of his,</HI> to wit a noble Pile of Building, with a great deal of Land round about it, beautiful Gardens, and Fish-ponds, and as well <HI>wooded</HI> as thou canst wish, and shall say unto <HI>thee,</HI> as Satan here unto our <HI>Saviour, All this will I give thee; or thou shalt have it for a Song; (thou shalt not pay above half the value,) if thou wilt promise me to keep out the proper Owner.</HI> What wilt thou do in such a Case?

<P>&sect; 5. The first of the Reasons I pretend to, for the Dissuasive I am upon, from any man's <HI>seeking Great Things for Himself,</HI> and for God's Prohibition, <HI>Seek them not,</HI> may be derived from the Fickleness of all Great Things on This side Heaven. Their having

nothing in them of Permanence, nothing of Certainty, or Firmness, which a man of any Prudence knows how to trust. From whence it follows <HI>ex abundanti,</HI> that they have nothing in them of <HI>lovely,</HI> for which they should be <HI>coveted</HI> or <HI>courted</HI> by us. And This is a Reason suggested to me from the very next words before my Text. <HI>Be|hold</HI> (says <HI>God</HI> to <HI>Baruch</HI> by the Mouth of <HI>Ieremiah</HI>) <HI>That which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even This whole Land.</HI> He does not Thus argue, There is a <HI>Flaw</HI> in the Building, which I will <HI>Therefore</HI> break down; or a <HI>Barrenness</HI> in the Plant, which I will <HI>Therefore</HI> pluck up. But I will do it <HI>pro Imperio,</HI> because I will. For <HI>I have built,</HI> and <HI>I have planted.</HI> The whole Land is mine, and I will order it as I please. He needs not argue from its <HI>Inhabitants</HI> whereby to justifie its <HI>Destruction,</HI> because He is not only the <HI>Owner,</HI> but the <HI>Author</HI> of it. His having once <HI>built,</HI> is reason enough for his <HI>breaking down.</HI> And his having once <HI>planted,</HI> is reason enough for his <HI>plucking up.</HI> Nor may the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Isa. 45. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Clay</HI> say to the Potter,

<HI>Why hast Thou made, or unmade me? why hast Thou used me Thus, or Thus?</HI> 'Tis true in God's distribution of <HI>endless Punishments and Rewards</HI> to the Sons of Men, He declares Himself to act as a <HI>Righteous Iudge,</HI> a Judge with whom there is <HI>not Respect of Per|sons,</HI> a Judge who <HI>renders unto every man ac|cording to his Deeds,</HI> and according to the <HI>Law</HI> He is bound to <HI>live</HI> by.

<P>&sect; 22.

First the Great Things <HI>below</HI> are but <HI>figuratively</HI> such, and <HI>secundum quid;</HI> somewhat Great in <HI>Appearance,</HI> but not <HI>indeed;</HI> or only Great in their <HI>relation</HI> to what is very much less; and so an <HI>Emmet-hill</HI> is as <HI>great</HI> in com|parison with its <HI>Inhabitants,</HI> as the whole Globe of <HI>Earth</HI> in respect of <HI>us.</HI> Whereas the Great Things <HI>above</HI> are Great <HI>simplici|ter,</HI> and in <HI>Themselves;</HI> They are <HI>absolute|ly</HI> Great, and <HI>without a figure.</HI> In compa|rison with <HI>Them,</HI> all the Great Things <HI>be|low</HI> do presently dwindle into a <HI>Point.</HI> The

very <HI>Orb</HI> the Sun moves in is 100000 times bigger than <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Earth;</HI> But in relation to the <HI>Circumference</HI> of the <HI>Coelum Empy|raeum,</HI> or but of That which is called the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> All the <HI>Dimensions</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> do immediately <HI>vanish,</HI> and <HI>lose</HI> themselves into a <HI>Center.</HI> Next the Great Things <HI>Below</HI> will sooner or later be sure to <HI>fail</HI> us, and so with very great reason they have the Title of <HI>Uncertain</HI> affixt un|to them in Holy Writ; whereas the Great Things <HI>Above</HI> will <HI>abide for ever;</HI> There the <HI>Crown</HI> is <HI>immarcescible;</HI> nor is there only an <HI>exceeding,</HI> but an <HI>eternal</HI> weight of Glory. Again, the Great Things <HI>Below</HI> are mixt with <HI>Troubles</HI> and <HI>Solicitudes;</HI> the <HI>Stream</HI> of their Injoyment does never run <HI>clear;</HI> but what with <HI>Crosses,</HI> or <HI>Cares,</HI> is always <HI>muddy;</HI> whereas the Great Things <HI>Above</HI> do flow with such <HI>Rivers</HI> of <HI>Delight,</HI> as cannot be <HI>mingled</HI> with the least <HI>Drop</HI> ei|ther of <HI>Sorrow,</HI> or <HI>Interruption;</HI> in the <HI>Pre|sence of God is Life,</HI> and most <HI>sincere</HI> plea|sures for evermore.

but <HI>inlarge</HI> a man's Appetite, and every man's <HI>Avarice</HI> is only <HI>wid'ned</HI> by his Posses|sions: whereas the Great Things <HI>Above</HI> will give us a <HI>plenary</HI> Satisfaction. <HI>There</HI> 'twill be <HI>one</HI> of our Injoyments, <HI>not to be able to Desire;</HI> All our <HI>Longings</HI> and <HI>Ambiti|ons</HI> will be wholly swallowed up into meer <HI>Fruition.</HI> Besides, the Great Things <HI>Below</HI> are very often by <HI>God's Permission,</HI> in the <HI>Disposal</HI> of the <HI>Devil;</HI> as is evident in the two Cases of Holy <HI>Iob,</HI> and the <HI>Sabaeans;</HI> of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> and <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> of <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> and <HI>Pontius Pilate;</HI> of the Greek Christians, and the Great Turk; of Innocent Travel|lers, and Highway Thieves. By which and many other Cases there can be no|thing more clear, than that the Great Things <HI>Below</HI> are by the <HI>Sufferance</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in the <HI>Devil's Disposal.</HI> Whereas the Great Things <HI>Above</HI> are above his Reach: His <HI>Chain of Darkness,</HI> which is his <HI>Tedder,</HI> fal|ling short of That Region from whence He fell. Lastly, the Great Things <HI>Above</HI> do all <HI>legitimate</HI> our <HI>seeking,</HI> and make it <HI>gracious;</HI> whereas the Great Things <HI>Be|low</HI> do increase its <HI>Guilt.</HI> And thence the

Great Things <HI>Above</HI> are strictly <HI>commanded</HI> to be <HI>sought;</HI> whereas the Great Things <HI>Below</HI> are under as strict a <HI>Prohibition.</HI> Those we <HI>must</HI> seek, with <HI>Baruch;</HI> But These, with <HI>Baruch,</HI> we must <HI>forbear.</HI></P>
