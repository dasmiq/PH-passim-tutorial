<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>BOTH <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France</HI> have swarm'd with Critiques
upon the Business of the Stage, and trac'd it's Histo|ry
up to <HI>Thespis</HI>'s Cart. The <HI>Mimica Satyra Tra|goedia
Comoedi&aacute;</HI> have been thoroughly canvass'd. A Man
might almost conjure with their <HI>Planipedes, Attalanae, Prae|textatae,
Tabernariae,</HI> &amp;c. Distinctions, Divisions and Sub|divisions,
but amongst them All not one word of a Farce.
None have taken into Consideration, or condescended to
tell us, whether the <HI>Trappolin, Scapin, Harlequin</HI> or <HI>Sca|ramouch</HI>
be Originals; or if <HI>France</HI> be a Species of Stage-Poetry
unknown to the Ancients. This Subject therefore
being yet untouch'd, and the Bookseller having occasion to
re-print this short Play, I thought it worth the business of a
Preface to speak my Sentiments of the matter, though but
to provoke some Learned Person to clear the Doubt, and
set the Question in a true Light.</P>
<P>In order to this Enquiry, 'twill be proper first to speak
something of those Stage-Properties or Implements called
<HI>Personae</HI> and <HI>Larvae,</HI> used by Players of former Times; for
<HI>Harlequill</HI> was not the first that acted in a Vizard.</P>
<P><HI>Athanaeus</HI> in his Twelfth Book mentions one <HI>Aristopha|nes</HI>
of <HI>Byzantium,</HI> with several others, who had written
particularly on this Subject. Amongst Latin Writers <HI>An|lon.
Codr. Vre.</HI> is said to have published an Elegant Epistle
concerning this matter. <HI>Caelius Calcagn.</HI> in his Book Entitu|led,
<PB REF="3">
<HI>Personati,</HI> speaks pretty home to the Point; and above
all, the Learned <HI>Bullinger, lib. 1. de Theatro.</HI></P>
<P>But I meet with enough for my purpose in the <HI>Syntagm.</HI>
of <HI>Marischott,</HI> who, for the benefit of most
Readers, contents himself with citing the
<HI>Latin</HI> Version of <HI>Lucian</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">De Personis &amp; Larvis.</NOTE>, and others, which
I have so transcribed on occasion as I there found them.
Neither can my Abstract of his Book seem needless, because
the Treatise it self having been only Printed in <HI>Italy,</HI> is
scarce to be met with in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis agreed that the Word <HI>Persona</HI> in a restrained Sence
signifies only the Vizard or Counterfeit Face worn by the
Actor: But in larger and more frequent Acceptation, the
whole Habit or Dress of Him that enter'd the Scene;
which (under the Reign of Old Comedy) was contrived
exactly like the usual wearing Garb of some Person
whom they had a mind to represent upon the Stage. An
Instance hereof against no less a Person than <HI>Socrates</HI> we
find described at large by <HI>Aelian.</HI> The Substance of the
Story is this: That <HI>Aristophanes</HI> in his <GAP DESC="foreign"> represented
both the Figure, Gesture and Habit of <HI>Socrates,</HI> with which
Spectacle the <HI>Athenians</HI> were at first surprized. However, the
common sort presently expressed their Applause. <HI>Socrates</HI>
himself being then amongst the Audience, not by chance
but design, and seated where he might be most exposed to
view, encountring with his grave, steddy and unconcerned
Countenance at once the Mimickry of the Actor, and Ral|lery
of the Poet.</P>
<P>But whether the Stage-dresses and Masks were made in
Imitation of some particular Person, or contrived by Hu|mour
and Fancy, as might be most agreeable to the Fable,
(in which they always observed a <HI>Decorum.</HI>) 'Tis evident,
says my Author, that they never enter'd the Scene <HI>nisi Per|sonis
induti.</HI></P>
<P>But who was the first Inventor of them is a matter of no
small Dispute. They appear to be as ancient as the Practice
<PB REF="3">
of Plays and Drolls themselves, which were of as old a date
as the Worship of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> or perhaps any other Gods.
That this manner of Celebrating the Rites of <HI>Bacchus</HI> was
in use not only among the <HI>Thracians</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> but also
very frequent and ancient among the <HI>Latins.</HI> We have
evident Proof from <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Georgicks, Lib.</HI> 11. with a most
Elegant Description of the <HI>Personae</HI> in these Words:
<Q><L>&mdash;Baccho caper omnibus Aris</L>
<L>Caeditur &amp; veteres ineunt proscenia Ludi:</L>
<L>Praemiaq&ugrave;e ingentes pagos &amp; compita circum</L>
<L>Thesidae posu&ecirc;re, atque inter pocula laeti</L>
<L>Mollibus in pratis unctos salire per utres;</L>
<L>Neo non Ausonii Troj&acirc; gens missa celoni</L>
<L>Versibus incomptis ludunt, risuque soluto</L>
<L>Oraque corticibus sumunt horrenda <HI>cavatis.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Ovid</HI> hints almost as much in the <HI>Minores Quinquatrus</HI>
celebrated in Honour of <HI>Minerva.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Et jam Quinquatrus jubeor narrare minores</L>
<L>Huc ades O caeptis slava Minerva meis;</L>
<L>Cur vagus incedat tota tibicen in urbe.</L>
<L>Quid sibi Personae, quid Toga picta velint.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Suidas</HI> affirms <HI>Chaerilus</HI> the <HI>Athenian</HI> to have been the
first that erected a Stage, and used the <HI>Larva;</HI> yet else|where
(according to <HI>Diomedes</HI> and other <HI>Greek</HI> Writers) he
makes <HI>Thespis</HI> Inventor of the <HI>Persona,</HI> who at first disco|loured
his Face with Vermilion, before he came to use the
Juyce of Purslane; or, according to <HI>Horace,</HI> the Lees of
Wine.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Plaustris vexisse Poemata Thespis</L>
<L>Quae canerent agerentur peruncti faecibus ora.</L></Q>
<P><PB REF="4">
This Practice, and <HI>Cartshow</HI>'s of <HI>Thespis</HI> were performed
about the <HI>56th</HI> Olympiad. Others give the Honour of
this Invention to <HI>Aeschylus,</HI> and presume that they have
likewise <HI>Horace's</HI> Word for their Opinion.</P>
<Q><L>Post hunc Personae pallae&abque; repertor honest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></L>
<L>Aeschylus&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>But <HI>Horace</HI> is still consistent, if rightly understood; for
he does not affirm <HI>Aeschylus</HI> to be the absolute Inventor of
the <HI>Persona,</HI> but of the <HI>Persona Honesta,</HI> of more graceful
Masks and Habits than were contrived by others; for
which Reason we may suppose, as <HI>Philostratus</HI> relates, this
<HI>Aeschylus</HI> was called the Father of Tragedy. After <HI>Aeschy|lus</HI>
Stage-Habits for Women were also invented by <HI>Phryni|cus.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst the <HI>Romans</HI> till <HI>Livius Andronicus</HI> his Time, the
<HI>Galeri</HI> and not <HI>Personae</HI> were used upon the Stage; and
<HI>Suidas</HI> will have <HI>Roscius Gallus</HI> to be the first that brought
the <HI>Personae</HI> into custom with the <HI>Romans;</HI> But <HI>Donatus</HI> tells
us, that <HI>Minutius</HI> and <HI>Prothonius</HI> were the first Players that
Acted Tragedy, <HI>Personati:</HI> Which Fashion afterwards ob|tained
that Degree, that <HI>Nero Caesar</HI> himself is recorded by
<HI>Suetonius</HI> to have appeared in such Dresses upon the open
Stage. <HI>Tragoedias cantaverit Personatus; Her&ocirc;um Deorum|que
item heroidum &amp; Dearum, Personis effictis.</HI> That pom|pous
and splendid Dresses were proper for Tragedy, both
<HI>Pollux</HI> and <HI>Donatus</HI> affirm.</P>
<P>Next to Tragedy came Satyr, which was but a Species
of the former, as appears by the <HI>Cyclops</HI> of <HI>Euripides.</HI>
This sort of <HI>Dramma</HI> (though less practised as the World
grew more civilized) had also it's peculiar <HI>Personae</HI> or <GAP DESC="foreign">,
made of Goats Skins and Hides, and other Beasts,
which are described by <HI>Dyonisius, Pollux</HI> and <HI>Causa|bon.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="4">
The personal Habits used in the Licentious <HI>Comdiaaevetus</HI>
were contrived (as we instanced) to repre|sent
particular Persons,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Poet. Lib. c. 4. 14. Lib. <HI>xi.</HI> c. 12. l. 4. c. <HI>ix. Mo|rum Charact.</HI> Ch. 6.</NOTE> which therefore
could he no constant or fix'd Garb; For <HI>Suidus</HI>
says expresly, <GAP DESC="foreign">, &amp;c.&mdash;
That is, <HI>Moris fuit ut Comici Personas Hi|strionibus
darent eorum similes quos imitaren|tur.
Horace</HI> alludes to the same Custom, <HI>Sat. 4. L.</HI> 1.&mdash;
<HI>Quivis Stomacheter eodem quo personatus Pater.</HI> Their re|sembling
Dresses (says the <HI>Scholiast</HI> upon <HI>Aristoph.</HI>) were
so aptly contrived, that the Spectators knew what Person
the Actor mimick'd at his first appearance, before he spoke
a Word. While <HI>Athens</HI> was a popular State, the Rabble
were so much delighted with these Representations of par|ticular
Men, that <HI>Isocrates</HI> complains they would run to
those Entertainments from their Orators, while they were
haranguing upon Matters of greatest Importance to the
Publick. 'Tis true, this Practice of exposing Men upon
the Stage, was at its beginning more justifiable, while con|fin'd
to those Limits mentioned by <HI>Horace,</HI>
<Q><L>Si quis erat dignus describi quod malus aut fur,</L>
<L>Quod Maechusve foret, aut Sicarius, aut alioqui</L>
<L>Famosus.&mdash;</L></Q>
Nay, it did not a little conduce to the reforming of the
State, in deterring Men from Wickedness;
upon which <HI>Dionys. Halycarn.</HI> did not stick to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Dionys. <GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>
affirm of <HI>Eupolis Cratinus</HI> and <HI>Aristophanes,</HI>
that they perform'd the Office of Philosophers
and States-men as well as of Poets. But when from repre|sentation
of evil Men, the Practice declin'd to the Tradu|cing
of the Good and Vertuous, and even to the Disho|nour
of Religion, and ridiculing their very Gods, 'twas
<PB REF="5">
high time for the Government to take Cognizance of the
Matter, and enact Laws to restrain their License.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Lex est accepta Chorus&abque;</L>

<P>Upon this Regulation succeed the <HI>Media</HI> and <HI>Nova Co|media,</HI>
in which the <HI>Personae ludicrae &amp; ad risum accommo|datae</HI>
were invented and made famillar to the Stage. One
contriv'd a peculiar Habit, when the part of a <HI>Paedagogue</HI>
was to be plaid, another of a Parisite, others of Bawds,
Cooks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All which are recited by
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In prolegom. ad Terent.</NOTE> <HI>Donatus,</HI> and more largely by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lib. 4. c. 19.</NOTE> <HI>Pollux.</HI>
That Comedians acted <HI>Personati</HI> in <HI>Te|rence</HI>
his time appears by an ancient Copy
of that Author preserved in the <HI>Vatican,</HI> where Figures are
drawn of the Actors in the Play, as they were <HI>Larvati</HI>
and <HI>Personati.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis impossible for us to conceive the Art and Curiosity
in the Contrivance and Making of these Shapes, in which
these Players acted, or how much the Player himself was
sometimes enamour'd on his <HI>Persona,</HI> or Stage-dress, attri|buting
his Success and Theatrical Applause to the Sem|blance
in which he acted. As to this Particular, <HI>Pliny</HI> has
given us an Instance of memorable Event in his Natural Hi|story,
<PB REF="5">
<HI>Lib. 8. cap.</HI> 43. speaking of <HI>M. Opilius Hilarius.</HI> He
tells us, That this Actor having wonderfully pleas'd the
People in performance of a certain Part; He invited his
Friends to a Treat upon his Birth-day, and this Shape in
which he succeeded so well being brought into his sight,
he pull'd off his banqueting Wreath from his Head to put it
upon the Figure, which he survey'd with such Pleasure,
that he lost his Sense, grew stiff and cold, and unperceived
by the Company, expir'd with Transport.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have discoursed of the <HI>Persona</HI> in the larger
Acceptation, as it signified amongst them, the intire Stage-Habit.
But must acknowledge that it was sometimes taken
in a more restrain'd Sense, and used by Actors for only
the <HI>Larva</HI> or Vizard, as the <HI>Larva</HI> again is sometimes men|tioned
to express the <HI>Persona</HI> intire.</P>
<P><HI>Martial</HI> uses the Word for a Border or Perriwigg, <HI>Epigr.
43. Lib.</HI> 3.
<Q><L>Mentiris juvenem tinctis Lentine capillis,</L>
<L>Tam subito Corvus, qui modo cignus eras;</L>
<L>Non omnes fallis, scit te Proserpina canum,</L>
<L>Personam capiti detrahet illa tuo.</L></Q>
<HI>But</HI> Seneca <HI>expresly for a Mask or Vizard,</HI> Quid tantopere
te supinat? Quid Vultum habitum&abque; oris praevertit ut malis
habere Personam quam faciem.</P>
<P>The Advantages of using these <HI>Persona</HI> or Disguises on
the Stage were, in Comedy, that they might first have Re|semblance
to the Person imitated, and afterwards adapted
for Humour, and to excite Mirth; besides the Consulting
the Decency of the Actors, who were in those Days gene|rally
<PB REF="6">
too modest to Act barefac'd,
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Yet <HI>Nero</HI> that Monster having compell'd Noblemen to act Parts in a Play, he Com|manded them to pull off their Vizards on the Stage, <HI>Histrio|num apparatu eos patefaci|ens Hominibus apud quos ipsi paul&ograve; ante Magistratum gesserant.</HI></NOTE> and in usual Habits. In Tragedy
the Dress assisted to the Pomp and
Show. The Tragedian's Vizard
making the Voice to come forth
more sonorous, being made with a
larger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lucian de Salt <HI>descri|bing the Mimick-Mask, says it was</HI> Larva pulcherrima, Quae non immane hint ut Tragica.</NOTE> Mouth that seem <HI>Hiare</HI>
as the Actor spoke, which I could
almost suppose <HI>Persius</HI> to hint at in
that Verse,
<Q>Fabula seu maesto ponatur hianda Tragedo.</Q>
The Convenience of these Disguises on other occasions, as
in Interludes at Sacred Rites (as they call'd them) is ma|nifest
from <HI>Servius</HI> on our fore-cited place
of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Vpon the</HI>&mdash;Bac|cho caper omni|bus aris, <HI>&amp;c. Georg. l.</HI> 2.</NOTE> <HI>Virgil, Quia necesse erat pro ratione Sa|crorum
aliqua ludicra &amp; turpia fieri quibus
populo possit risus Moveri, qui ea exercebant,
propter verecundiam remedium hoc adhibue|runt,
ne agnoscerentur.</HI></P>
<P>Yet were not Disguises Masks and Maskers, employ'd
only in the Service of the Theatre and Temples, but pro|miscuously
used by the Ancients on many other occasions,
as in Triumphs, Feasts, Marriages, Funerals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Hi|story
whereof would be furnish'd with many entertaining
Circumstances; but I must remember that I am confin'd
to the scanty Limits of a Preface.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
The good Uses that have been made of Vizards
and Counterfeit-Habits, without the compass of the
Theatre would make no small Collection, but the Abu|ses
of them much greater. This would afford more
Horror than Diversion. The yearly Harvest of Wick|edness,
and evil Consequences occasion'd by the Car|nival
at <HI>Venice,</HI> give too sufficient Proofs of the Mis|chief.
<HI>Larvati</HI> took their Appellation from <HI>Larva,</HI>
a Vizard; and <HI>Larva</HI> from the <HI>Lares,</HI> whom the Anci|ents
supposed to possess Men's Minds with Madness.
This was ascribed as peculiar to those Powers. Can
there be greater Demonstration of Distraction and
Frenzy of all sorts, than in the Impious Practices and
Debaucheries at the fore-mentioned Festival? Can all
their Mortifications of the ensuing <HI>Lent</HI> make any to|lerable
Amends for the Lewdness then committed? Has
the Devil at any time such a Jubilee, where Vice like
an Infernal <HI>Cebele</HI> sees all her black Offspring assembled
together? What are the effects of this Masquerade,
but Whoredoms, Adulteries, Incests, Brawls, Murders,
and a general Corruption of Manners. <HI>Pollydor.</HI> re|cites
it to the Honour of our <HI>English</HI> Ancestors, that
they had Law in force against Masqueradings, <HI>Capitale
fuisse si quis personam induisset. De Rev. Invent. l. 5. c.</HI> 2.
<HI>Ludovicus vives, lib. de Christian&acirc; Faemin&acirc;,</HI> thinks he
did the Masquerading Ladies no wrong, in affirming,
that <HI>detrimentum quod sub Person&acirc; earum accepit vere|cundia
citra personam se proferat &amp; ostendat.</HI> That they
proved after wearing those Disguises just as modest out
of their Masques as they were in them. And honest
<HI>Iuvenal</HI> civilly puts the Question,
<Q>Quem praestare potest mulier Larvata pudorem?</Q></P>
<P><PB REF="7">
But restoring these Guises to their proper Owners,
the Stage-Players, let us proceed from the Considerati|on
of th <HI>Larva</HI> to our first Enquiry about <HI>Farce,</HI> and
whether or no the Ancients had any such Species of
Stage-Poetry.</P>
<P>In the first place I would ask the Readers Opinion, if he
can suppose any more genuine and natural use of those
<HI>Larvae</HI> or Vizards which we have described, than for
Farce-Players, especially if we take in those other Im|plements
mentioned by <HI>Lucian, de Salt.</HI> thus rendred by
<HI>Marisch. Mitto adscitia pectora &amp; ventres fictitios, ad|junctam
&amp; arte compositam corporis crassitudinem.</HI> One
would almost conclude from this Description of their
Stage-Properties, that they could be contrived for no|thing
but Farce.</P>
<P>I have not yet seen any Definition of Farce, and dare
not be the first that ventures to define it. I know not
by what Fate it happens (in common Notion) to be the
most contemptible sort of the Drama. 'Tis thought
to bring least Reputation to an Author. But if the dif|ficulty
of the Task were to decide the Case, we should
soon alter our Opinion. I would desire him who thinks
it an easie thing, to make Tryal of it with all the speed
he can, it being such a Work
<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ld. <HI>Roscom.</HI> Transl.</NOTE> As every man may think to write,</L>
<L>And not without much pains be undeceiv'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>The reason of the Difficulty I presume to be this,
(and the Undertakers will find it true) That Comedy
properly so called, is an Imitation of Humane Life,
(<HI>quicquid agunt homines</HI>) and subsists upon Nature; so
that whosoever has a Genius to coppy her, and will take
the Pains, is assured of Success, and all the World af|fords
<PB REF="7">
him Subject. Whereas the business of Farce ex|tends
beyond Nature and Probability. But then there are
so few Improbabilities that will appear pleasant in the Re|presentation,
that it will strain the best Invention to find
them out, and require the nicest Judgment to manage
them when they are conceived. Extravagant and mon|strous
Fancies are but sick Dreams, that rather torment
than divert the Mind; but when Extravagancy and Im|probability
happen to please at all, they do it to purpose,
because they strike our Thought with greatest Surprise.
But to our Question.</P>
<P>I cannot averr, that the Ancients had Entertainments
on the Stage entirely resembling the <HI>Harlequin</HI> and <HI>Sca|ramouch,</HI>
but 'tis highly probable that the Satyrical Diver|sions
and Interludes invented to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">As the <HI>French</HI> now make use of their Farces.</NOTE> relieve
the Heaviness of Tragedy were of this
Nature&punc; For that they were introduced
for Mirth and Rallery, and thereby to
help off the serious Action, is expresly told us.</P>
<Q><L>Carmine qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum</L>
<L>Mox etiam egrestes Satyros nudavit, &amp; asper</L>
<L>Incolumi gravitate, jocum te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">tavit: e&ograve; quod</L>
<L>Illecebris erat &amp; grat&acirc; Novitate morandus</L>
<L>Spectator.</L></Q>
<P>For as Madam <HI>le Fevre</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">In her admi|rable Preface to her Version of <HI>Amphitrio.</HI></NOTE> says, the Stage-Satyr;
or Satyrizing Scenes must by no
means be confounded with Satyrique Poems
written by <HI>Lucilius, Horace,</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> Sa|tyrist.
The business of the Satyr-Actors
was not to lash out into long Invectives, only now and
then a Elurt of such harmless Sarcasm as used to be some|times
thrown out by <HI>Harlequin</HI> or <HI>Scaramouch,</HI> because as
<HI>Horace</HI> adds,
<Q><PB REF="8">
<L>Ita risores ita commendare dicaoes</L>
<L>Conveniet Satyros, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
Which shews they were to keep within Bounds; and what
he subjoyns
<Q>&mdash;Ita vertere seria ludo.</Q>
Seems to emply Drollery, Banter, Buffoonry, Vagaries,
Whimsies, which are so many Ingredients of Modern
Farce. Nay, I have some where read (though I cannot
at present recollect my Author) that their Comick
Actors used to deliver what they had to say in various and
feigned Tones, which was <HI>Harlequin</HI>'s manner.</P>
<P>Nor will this appear unlikely, if we consider particu|larly
the Gesticulations, Tricks, Feats of Activity and
wonderful Performances of another sort of Actors whom
they called <HI>Mimi</HI> and <HI>Pantomimi,</HI> from their admirable
knack at Mimickry; which was not the least of <HI>Harle|quin</HI>'s
and <HI>Scaramouch</HI>'s Talents. 'Tis unconceivable how
expert these Persons were in humorous Actions, as will
appear by a few Testimonies very well worth our menti|oning.</P>
<P>Their Performance was so extraordinary, that as <HI>Strabo</HI>
informs us, <HI>Lib.</HI> 14. their Art was called <GAP DESC="foreign">. their
Legerdemain Shifts, Slights and Postures, Magical Arts,
<HI>Praestigia:</HI> And further asserts, <HI>Eos quam saepissime argu|mento

There was no Fable accommodated to the Stage, which
these Mute-Actors could not represent by Gestures and

personate five Representations, cries, That the Mimick
seem'd to him to have five Souls, who could exhibit so
many Personages with one Body. What was all this but
Farce to the Degree of <HI>Harlequin</HI> with his Cloak, whisk'd
about, and acting a Windmil.</P>
<P>All this, you'll say, was only Farce of Action, Farce
in the Player, nothing on the Poets Part, no Proof that
the Ancients had any written Farce.</P>
<P>I will not affirm they had any Stage-Play entirely of
<HI>Harlequin</HI> and <HI>Scarramouch</HI>'s Cast; but if <HI>Molier</HI>'s Come|dies
come under the Denomination of Farce, (as every
body allows) 'tis plain that both the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI>
had Farcical Plays. The Comedies of <HI>Aristophanes</HI> and
<HI>Plautus</HI> are mostly of this Cut, call them <HI>Palliatae, Togatae,</HI>
mixt Comedy, low Comedy, or what you will. Their
Old Comedy, generally speaking, had the very Air of
Farce. <HI>Aristophanes</HI> his <HI>Socrates</HI> Philosophing in a Bas|ket,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> is as much Farce as any thing in the Character
<PB REF="9">
of Mr. <HI>Shadwell</HI>'s <HI>Virtuoso.</HI> The Frog and Swimming-Master,
Tame Spider, Bottled Air, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not more
Humorous and Farcy. <HI>Aristophanes</HI> his <HI>Frogs</HI> were a ve|ry
<HI>Rehearsal</HI> of those days; As our <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s <HI>Knight of
the Burning Pestle</HI> was a sort of <HI>Quixot</HI> on the Stage.
Which teaches us, that Farce is not inconsistent with
good Sence, because 'tis capable of Satyr, which is Sence
with a Vengeance. The <HI>Amphytrio</HI> and <HI>Menae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">h</HI> of <HI>Plau|tus</HI>
through the whole Contrivance and Course of Acci|dents
are all Farce. They were the Originals of <HI>Shake|spear</HI>'s
Comedy of Errours, and the <HI>Italian Trappoline.</HI>
I would not be a Heretick in Poetry, but Reason and Ex|perience
convince us, that the best Comedies of <HI>Ben.
Iohnson</HI> are near a-kin to Farce; nay, the most entertain|ing
parts of them are Farce it self. The Alchymist which
cannot be read by any sensible Man without Astonish|ment,
is Farce from the opening of the First Scene to
the end of the Intr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">igue. 'Tis Farce but such Farce as
bequeaths that Blessing (pronounced by <HI>Horace</HI>) on him
that shall attempt the like.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Sudet multum frustra&abque; lab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ret</L>

<P>The whole business is carry'd on with Shuffles, Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">m
and Banter, to the greatest degree of Pleasantness in the
World. For Farce (in the Notion I have of it) may ad|mit
of most admirable Plot, as well as subsist sometimes
without it. Nay, it has it's several Species or Distincti|ons
as well as Comedy amongst the <HI>Romans Stataria mix|ta,
&amp;c.</HI> but still 'twas Comedy. So Comedy may admit
of Humour, which is a great Province of Farce; but
then it might be such Humour as comes within compass
of Nature and Probability: For where it exceeds these
Bounds it becomes Farce. Which Freedom I would al|low
<PB REF="9">
a Poet, and thank him into the Bargain, provided he
has the Judgment so to manage his Excursion, as to
heighten my Mirth without too grosly shocking my
Senses. I cannot call to mind one Humour in all <HI>Terence</HI>'s
Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ys, but what he might have taken by Observation,
all lies within the Compass of Conversation; but there|fore
<HI>Caesar</HI> (amidst all his Beauties and Excellencies) says
he, wants the <HI>Vis Comica,</HI> which made <HI>Plaurus</HI> so divert|ing.
There is so much said for these two Authors by
their respective Admirers, that a Man knows not where
to give the Preference. All that I would presume to say,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s, That I esteem them both admirable in their way;
that one chose to write pure Comedy in the strictest No|tion,
and the other liberty of extending Comedy some|times
into Farce; and each got his Point, <HI>Terence</HI> of be|ing
exact, and <HI>Plautus</HI> pleasant. Neat <HI>Terence,</HI> witty
<HI>Plautus,</HI> says our greatest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ben. Ialmson<HI>'s Verses on</HI> Shake|spear.</NOTE> Master of Co|medy,
who scorn'd not to Copy some|times
from the Ancients; yet for one Hint
he has taken from <HI>Terence,</HI> he has bor|rowed
three from <HI>Plautus.</HI> I will instance only that
pleasant Passage in his <HI>Alchymist,</HI> where the Confederates
banter and play upon <HI>Surly</HI> disguised like a <HI>Spanish Don,</HI>
not supposing that he understood them. We find the
same Humour in the <HI>Paenulus</HI> of <HI>Plautus,</HI> where the old
<HI>Carthaginian</HI> speaks in the <HI>Punick</HI> Language; <HI>Milphio</HI> a
<HI>Roman</HI> Servant plays the wagg, and drolls upon him, un|der
pretence of interpreting for him; the Stranger suf|fers
him to run himself out of breath with his Ribaldry,
and then surprizes him with thundring out as good Latin
as the best of them could speak. <HI>Vulpone</HI>'s playing the
Mountebank in the <HI>Fox</HI> is Farce; and Sir <HI>Politick</HI>'s turn|ing
himself into a Tortoise. This Passage however is un|diverting,
which proves (as I said) the Nicety of Judg|ment
required in managing Improbabilities. Had this
<PB REF="10">
been told to the Audience like other Projects which are
only recited, it might have made a pleasant Relation.</P>
<P>Now if we enquire into the best of our Modern Co|medies,
we should find the most diverting parts of them
to be Farce, or near a-kin to it. <HI>Remembrancer Iohn</HI> in the
<HI>Cutter,</HI> Sir <HI>Martin</HI> turn'd East-India Gentleman, the Try|al
Scene in the <HI>Spanish Fryar,</HI> where <HI>Gomes</HI> menac'd by
the Colonel in dumb shew, runs Counter in his Evidence,
says and unsays in a Breath, till he confounds himself and
the Court. Such Pleasantry as this is I cannot think be|low
it's great Author, who in the Serious Scenes of the
same Play, has shewn us the Refinedness and Perfection
of the <HI>English</HI> Style. <HI>Quintilian,</HI> speak|ing
of <HI>Repartees,</HI> after these Words,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Lib. <HI>vi.</HI> c. 3. de Risu.</NOTE> <HI>Lon|g&egrave;
venustiora omnia in respondendo quam in
provocando;</HI> That more Wit's required to retort a Jest
than to break one, adds this Expression, <HI>Accedit difficul|tati
quod ejus rei nulla exercitatio est, nulli praeceptores.</HI>
The same may be said of Farce; there are no Rules to
be prescribed for that sort of Wit, no Patterns to Copy,
'tis altogether the Creature of Imagination. And our
<HI>English Mec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">nas</HI> (to whose Judgment the Muses willing|ly
subscribe) has declared that he approves <HI>Genius</HI> and
<HI>Invention</HI> beyond the best Performances of <HI>Imitation.</HI>
Such is the Farce-Writers Task. Neither can I assume
any thing to my self by the Preference I have given to
Farce on account of the <HI>Trapoline,</HI> which I only new
modell'd: I pretend but to have Improv'd what I would
be proud to have Invented.</P>
