How we ought to demeane our selues for sleep, what beds are most fitte to repose our lims vpon, what quantitie of repast wee must receiue, as also the inconuenience that re|doundes vnto our bodies by immoderate sleepe; excellent is that Chapter of <HI>Cle|mens</HI> in the 2. of his <HI>Pedagog:</HI> First, hee<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clemens. 2. paedag. cap. 9</NOTE> aduiseth vs to shunne <GAP DESC="foreign">, beds softer then sleepe it selfe, affirming, that it is daungerous and hurtfull to lie on beds of downe, our bodies for the softnes thereof <GAP DESC="foreign">, as falling and sinking downe into them, as into a vaste, gaping and hollow pit; these beds are so farre from helping concoction, that they enflame the natiue heate, and

<P>_We must know that all naturall bodies haue their composi|tion of the mixture of the e|lemntes, fire, ayre, water, earth: now are they either e|qually poisd according to their waight, in their combinatio~, as iust so much of one element, as there is of another, throughout the quaternio or whole number: as ima|gin a duplu~, quadruplu~ or decuplu~ of earth, so much iust of fire, as much of ayre, and the like quantity of water and no more th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> they bee truly ballanced one againe ano|ther in our vnderstanding: when there are as many degrees of heat as of could, of dri|nesse as of moisture, or they bee distempe|rate or vnequall, yet measured by worthi|nesse, where one hath dominion ouer ano|ther: as in beasts that liue vpon the center, earth and water do domineere: in fowles commonly aire and fire are predominant, Or thus, where the true qualities are inhe|rent
<PB N="39" REF="51">
and rightly giuen vnto their proper subiects: as in the heart well tempered heat consists: moisture rules in the braine hauing his true temper: cold in the fatte: drines in the bones. The first is tearmed <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <HI>Temperame~tum ad pondus,</HI> which is found in none, though they haue neuer so excellent and surpassing a temperature: onely imaginary: yet in some sort held to be exta~t by <HI>Fernelius.</HI> The other is called <HI>Temperamentum ad iustitiam,</HI> which distri|butes euery thing it owne, according to the equity of parts. Of the predominion of a|ny element, or rather the qualities of the element, the complection hath his peculi|ar denomination: as if the element of fire be chieftaine, the body is said to be chole|ricke: if ayre beare rule; to be sanguine: if water bee in his vigour, the body is said to be phlegmaticke: if earth haue his domini|on, to be melancholicke. For choler is hot and dry; blood hotte and moist; water cold and moist: earth could and drie. These four complections, are compared to the 4. eleme~ts: secondly to the four planets <HI>Mars, Iupiter, Saturne, Luna.</HI> the~ to the four winds: then to the four seasons of the yeare: fiftly vnto the twelue Zodiacall signes, in the~

hardly incensed with anger, and if angry, long ore this passion be appeased and mi|tigated, crafty headed, constant in their determination, fixing their eies vsually on the earth, while a man recites a tale vnto them, they will picke their face, bite their thumbes, their eares will bee soiourners; like <HI>Cleomenes</HI> in <HI>Plutarch, a|nimus est in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> their wit is a wool ga|thering, for laughing they be like a most to <HI>Anaxagoras,</HI> of whom <HI>Aelian</HI> sayes <GAP DESC="foreign">, hee neuer laught: they be much giuen to a solein monastich life, neuer welnie delighted with consort: very subiect to passions: hauing a droppe of wordes and a flood of cogitations vsing that of <HI>Pythagoras</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">: they are colde in their exter|nall partes: of a kinde nature to them with whome they haue long conuerst, and though they seeme for some dislike to alienate their mindes from their friend, yet are they constant in affection.</P>

There was an humorous me|lancholicke scholer, who being close at his study, as he was wiping his rheumatick nose, prese~tly imagined that his nose was bigger then his whole body, and that the weight of it weighed downe his heade, so that he altogether was ashamed to come in to company: The Phisicions to cure him of this conceit, inuented this meanes, they tooke a great quantity of flesh hauing the proportion of a nose, which they cun|ningly join'd to his face, whiles hee was a sleepe, then beeing waken they rased

his skinne with a rasour till the bloud thrilled downe, and whiles hee cried out vehemently for the paine, the Physicion with a jirke twitcht it from his face, and threw it away. Of his conceit that thought himselfe deade, it is related of many, who was cured after this maner: they fur|nisht a table with variety of dishes, and caused three or foure in white linnen sheetes to sitte downe and eate the meate in his presence, who demaun|ded what they were? they answered that they were Ghosts: nay, then replied hee, if Spirites eate then I thinke I may eate too, and so hee fell roundly to his victuals, hauing not eate any in a sennight before. There was one that tooke a conceit hee was a God, who was thus ridde of his malady: hee was pend vppe in an iron grate, and hadde no meate giuen him at all, onely they adored him and offered to his deity the fumes of frankincense, and odours of delicate dishes which alwaies past by him: whose deity grew at the length so hu~gry that he was fain to co~fesse his huma nity vnles he had me~t to haue been starued.

<P>Many moe be rehearsed in that place which is worthy to bee read: wherein the poet shewes himselfe both a Diuine, an Historian, a Philosopher and Phisicion. In treating of dreames wee will not intet|meddle with these, the ominous and fatall dreames wee read of in the sacred writ. One portentous dream I will recite which comes to my memory, and which I my selfe heard related of the party that drea|med it. There was one that dreamed she was walking in a greenish meade, all fra|grant with beautifull flowers and flouri|shing plants, who whiles she wondred and stood as amaz'd at the glory of the spring: an auncient sire all withered aud lean-fac'd with eld, the very embleme of death, made toward her with a greene bow in his hand, sharpning it at the end, whoe, as shee fled away from his pursuit did dartit often at her, the branch three times comming very neare her yet did not touch her at all; who when hee see he could not preuaile with his aime, vanished eft away and left the bow behind, and shee as astounded and affright with the dreame presently a|wooke: now marke the sequel of it: with|in
<PB REF="88">
three daies after shee was for recreation sake, walking in a greenish inclosure hard by a pond side, and on a suddaine her brain was so intoxicate &amp; distempered, whether with a spice of a <HI>vertigo,</HI> or what amazing disease soeuer I know not, but shee was hurried into a deepe pond with her head forward, being in great peril of drow ning, and if shee had not caught fast hold by chance on a branch that hung ouer the water, shee had beene drowned indeed. These also are fatall dreames, as when we dreame of Eagles flying ouer our heade, it portends infortunatenes: to dreame of ma|riages, dauncing and banquetting foretels some of our kinsfolkes are departed; to dreame of siluer, sorrow, if thou hast it gi|uen thy selfe: of gold, good fortune; to loose an axill tooth or an eye, the death of some speciall friend: to dreame of bloody teeth, the death of the dreamer: to weep in sleepe, ioy: to contemplate ones face in the water, and to see the dead, long life: to ha~dle lead, some mela~cholick disease: to see a Hare, death: to dream of chickins and birds, commonly ill lucke: all which, and a thousand more I will not auer to be true, yet because I haue found them or many of

them fatall both by mine owne and others experience, and to be set downe of I ar|ned men; and partly to shewe what an ominous dreame is, I thought good to name them in this chapter.</P>
<P>Vaine dreames be: whe~ a man imagins hee doth such things in his sleepe, which he did the day before: the species being<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE> strongly fixed in his phantasie, as if he ha|uing read of a <HI>Chim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ra, Sphynx, Tragela|phus, Centaurus</HI> or any the like poeticall fiction, sees the like formed in his phanta|sies according to their peculiar parts: &amp; such as when wee dreame wee are perfor|ming any bodily exercise, or laughing, or speaking &amp;c. these also may bee fatall, as if wee dreame wee do not any thing with the same alacritie, with the like cun|ning, and in the same excellency in our sleepe as we did them in the day time, they foreshew some perturbation of body, so saith the Physicion in his treatise of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hippoc. in his booke of dreames.</NOTE> dreames: for hee saith that those dreames which are not aduerse to diurnall actions, and that appeare in the purity of their sub iects, and eminency of the conceiued spe|cies, are intimates of a good state of health as to see the Sunne and Moone note clip|sed,

but in their sheene glory: to journey without impediment in a plaine soile, to see trees shoot out and ladened with variety of fruites, brookes sliding in sweete meades with a soft murmure, cleare waters, neither swelling too hie nor run|ning nie the channell, these sometimes are vaine and portend nothing at all, some times they signifie a sound temperature of body.
