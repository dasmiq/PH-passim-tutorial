<Q><P>I suppose that All which is intended by that Phrase, <HI>Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart,</HI> &amp;c. amounts to no more than (<HI>1st,</HI>) a sincere Love, as 'tis opposed to that which is partial, and di|vided; and <HI>(2dly,)</HI> such a degree of Loving as admits of nothing into Competition with him.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>I Think I have sufficiently considered all that is material both in the <HI>Ser|mon,</HI> and in the <HI>Letters</HI> of Mr. <HI>N.</HI> and the <HI>Lady.</HI> In his <HI>Preface</HI> he en|deavours to vindicate his Exposition from Singularity, appealing, 1. to the <HI>Books</HI> that are <HI>written after the Mystical and Spiri|tual way,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> Still. <HI>Fa|nat. of the Ch. of</HI> Rome, <HI>p.</HI> 327.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> those <HI>Phanatical</HI> Pretenders to extraordinary Visions and Illumina|tions, <HI>to passive Unions,</HI> and <HI>Deiform Funds of the Soul, a State of Introversion,</HI> and <HI>a Superessential Life,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 259.</NOTE> who talk of <HI>being bae|losed in the Midhead of God, and in his Meek|head, and his Benignity, and in his Buxom|ness.</HI> And sure it is not much for his Glory that such Persons speak like him.</P>
<P N="2">2. To some <HI>French Poets</HI> and <HI>Divines,</HI> which neither can we envy him.</P>
<P>But, 3. Whereas he calls in the Suffrage of the <HI>Reverend</HI> and <HI>Learned Bishop Lake,</HI> a Man too Great to be overlook'd; he is the very Person whose sense of the words contested I have given, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. &sect;. 1. and
<PB REF="3">
who in his <HI>Seventh Sermon</HI> is most express against him in these words,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>On Matth.</HI> 22.27.</NOTE> </P>
<Q><P>But <HI>mistake me not, All other things besides God, are not excluded of our Love.</HI> &mdash;
Wherefore, for the farther understanding of this <HI>Entire|ness of the Love of God,</HI> we must not take other things <HI>opposit&egrave;,</HI> but <HI>composit&egrave;</HI>; we <HI>must exclude nothing from our Love</HI> that doth not enter into competition with God, and oppose it self against the Love of God.</P><P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI>
If there be any thing that may be loved jointly with God, it must not be taken as <HI>Coordinatum,</HI> but <HI>Subordinatum</HI>; it must not share equally with God, but keep its distance, and receive our Love by a reflection from God.</P><P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI>
Upon this Inequality must our Love ground an unequal Estimate of things, and we must love God <HI>above all Appretiativ&egrave;</HI>; we must account all, in comparison of God, to be as Dung, to be very Loss.</P><P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI>
Finally, according to the Esti|mate, must the heat of our Affection be; we must love God <HI>above all Inten|tiv&egrave;</HI> also; we must love other things as fit to be used, not fit to be enjoy'd, yea, we must use all the World <HI>as if we used it not,</HI> but we must love God as him whom we would not only use, but en|joy also</P><P><PB REF="3">Again,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 335</NOTE>
There be many things and Persons which we are allow'd to love, but we must love them only until they come to the Comparison. If then the Question be, Whether of the two we love more, to Whether of them we will stick in a case where both cannot be held; or upon which of them we will fall foul, when it is not possible for us to keep in with both, if then we can with <HI>Moses, esteem the Reproach of Christ greater Riches than the Treasures of Egypt,</HI> we conform our selves to Christ's first Rule.</P><P>Thus if we love God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 336.</NOTE> we love him as we ought, that is, we love him <HI>above all things,</HI> and we love him <HI>for himself</HI>; for that must needs follow when we love him for no other thing, no not for our own sakes, but are willing to hazard all, even our selves and all, for the love of him.</P></Q>
<P>This, I hope, is sufficient to shew that <HI>Excellent Prelate</HI> is an Adversary to the Exposition of Mr. <HI>N.</HI> and an Abettor of the Vulgar Exposition.</P>
<P>He appeals, 4<HI>thly,</HI> to St. <HI>Austin, in his Devotional Tracts.</HI> Now true it is, that St. <HI>Austin</HI> hath said many things which, to one unacquainted with his use of Phra|ses, may mislead him into this Imagina|tion, tho', as he doth explain them, it
<PB REF="4">
is evident they are nothing to the pur|pose. <HI>V. G.</HI> He inveighs very much <HI>con|tra cupiditatem mundi,</HI> but then he lets you know that we are then only Guilty of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cupiditatem voco omnem motum ad fruendum se, &amp; proximo, &amp; quolibet corpore non propter Deum.</HI> De Doctr. Christian. l. 3. c. 10.</NOTE> <HI>when our Souls move towards themselves, their Neighbour, or any other thing without respect to God.</HI></P>
<P>For otherwise he informs us that the Fault we commit in the use of these tran|sitory things,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nam in om|nibus hujus|modi rebus non ex earum rerum natu|ra quibus utimur, sed ex caus&acirc; utcudi, &amp; modo appetendi, vel probandum est, vel improbandum, quod facimus,</HI> cap. 12.</NOTE> <HI>is not in the nature of the things themselves, but from the cause of using, and the manner or degree of desiring them.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes he will not allow us <HI>dili|gere terrena,</HI> but then it is because <HI>dilection is a word that is used properly only for the love of better things.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dilectionis enim nomen magis solet in melioribus r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">busdici, in melioribus rebus accipi.</HI> To. 9. Tr. 8. in Ep. Johan. p. 633.</NOTE> Sometimes he will also tell us we must not <HI>amare,</HI> love Earthly things; but then to love them is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nihil aliud est amare, quam propte s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ipsum rem aliquam appetere</HI> To. 4. 80 Qu. c. 35. p. 543.</NOTE> in his Lan|guage, <HI>only to affect them for themselves</HI>; for otherwise, saith he. <HI>Non prohibet te Deus amare ista, sed non de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">igere ad beatitudinem, God doth not absolutely forbid thee to love these things, but he forbids thee to love them as thy Hap|piness.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="4">He also oft informs us that we must not <HI>enjoy,</HI> but only <HI>use</HI> these things, but then he adds, That <HI>we enjoy that only which we love for it self,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Decimus ea re nos per|frui, quam diligimus propter s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ip|sam, &amp; ea r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> nobis fru|en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">um esse tantum, quae efficimur bea|ti, caeteris ver&ograve; utendum.</HI> De Doctr Christian. l. 1. c. 31</P>
<P><HI>Quanquam &amp; vicinissim&egrave; dicitur frui, cum delectatione uti, cum enim adest quod diligitur, etiam delectatione jecum, necesse est, gerat, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r quam si transieris, eamque ad illud ubi permanendum est, retuleris, uteris ea, &amp; abusiv&egrave;, non propr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&egrave; diceris frui, si vero inhaeseris, atque permanseris finem in e&acirc; ponens laetitiae tuae, tunc ver&egrave;, &amp; frui dicendus es.</HI> Cap. 33.</P></NOTE> <HI>and in which we place our Happiness, and make the end of our Ioy</HI>; but if by enjoying be only meant <HI>that using them with delight,</HI> and <HI>so as to pass from them to that in which we ought to rest</HI>; this he allows of.</P>
<P>Take St <HI>Austin</HI> without his own Inter|pretation of the words <HI>Love, Dilection, Concupiscence, Enjoyment,</HI> and he seems oft to favour Mr. <HI>N.</HI>'s new Notion; but if he be permitted to be his own <HI>Interpreter,</HI> he will be found to have said nothing to his purpose, of which we cannot have a fuller Evidence than his own Exposition on the words urged by Mr. <HI>N.</HI> for his own Opinion. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. St. <HI>Austin</HI> in his First Book of <HI>Chri|stian Doctrine,</HI> sets himself expresly to the Consideration of the words of St. <HI>Mat|thew, Chap.</HI> 22.37. and in his Discourse upon them expresly grants, <HI>That the love of our selves, and the love of the Body, and
<PB REF="5">
of Provisions for it is included;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Modus ergo diligendi prae cipiendus est homini, id est quomodo se diligat, aut prosit sibi, quin autem se diligat aut prosit sibi dubitare, dementis est; praecipiendum etiam quomodo Corpus suum diligat, nam quod diligat corpus suum&punc; idque salvum habere, atque integrum velit, aeque manife|stum est. &mdash; Ergo praecepto non opus est ut se quisque, &amp; corpus suum diligat, quum id quod simus, &amp; id quod infra nos est, &amp; ad nos tantum pertinet, inconcussa naturae lege diligimus.</HI> Cap. 25.</NOTE> <HI>and for this,</HI> saith he, <HI>we need no Precept, the Law of Nature teaching us, and the Beasts thus to love.</HI></P>
<P>And when he comes to give us the sum of what he had discoursed upon this Subject, he begins it with this Adver|tisement, That <HI>there needs no Precept to engage us to love our selves</HI>; and that we may know, and do this, the whole tem|poral Dispensation of Providence, saith he,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hoc ergo ut nosecremus, &amp; p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ssemus, facta est tota pro salute no|stra per di|vinam pro|videntiam dispensatio temporalis, qu&acirc; debemus uti, non quasi mansoria quadam dilectione, atque delectatione, sed transitori&acirc; potius, tanquam via, tan|quam vehiculorum, &mdash; Ut ea quibus ferimur, propter illud ad q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">od fe|rimur, diligamus.</HI> Cap. 35.</NOTE> was designed, <HI>which we are to use not with a permanent Love and Delight, but only with a transitory, as being the way, the Vehecles, the Instruments, the things by which we are carried up to him we love.</HI></P>
<P>In his set Discourse upon those words of St <HI>Iohn, Love n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t the World, neither the things of the World,</HI> he expresly de|clares. <HI>That God doth not absolutely forbid us to love these things, but only not to love
<PB REF="5">
them as our Happiness;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Non te prohi|bet Deus a|mare ista, sed non diligere ad beatitudi|nem, sed ad hoc probare, &amp; laudare, ut ames creatorem &mdash; Si autem amaveris haec, quamvis illa Deus fe|cerit, &amp; neglexeris creatorem&mdash; Nonne tuus amor Adulterinus deputa|bitur? &mdash; Nunquid non est in his modus? Aut quando d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">citur, Nolite ista diligere, hoc dicitur? Ut non manducetis, aut non bibatis aut filios non procreetis? Non hoc dicitur, sed sit modus propter creatorem, ut non vos illigent istu dilectione, ne ad fruendam hoc ametis, quod ad utendum ha|bere debetis.</HI> Tr. 2. p. 592.</NOTE> <HI>not so as to neglect our Creator; that he requires us to use a mean in our Affection to them, and not to enjoy what we should only use, nor have our Affe|ctions cleaving to them.</HI></P>
<P>In his <HI>Meditations,</HI> which is one of his <HI>Devotional Tracts,</HI> he observes how the <HI>World,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Respic&egrave; uni|versum mun|dum &amp; con|sidera si in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o aliquid sit quod tibi non s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rviat omnis creatura ad hunc finem cursum suum dirigit ut ob|sequiis tuis famuletur, &amp; utilitati de|serviat tuis|que oblectamentis pariter &amp; necessitatbus secundum affluentiam &amp; defi|cientiam occurrat.&mdash; Si autem ista Diligis ut subjecta dilige, ut ar|rum sponsi, ut munera amici, &amp; beneficia Domini; sic tamen ut memi|neris semper quod illi debeas, nec ista propter se sed ista propter illum, nec ista cum illo sed ista propter illum &amp; per ista illum &amp; super ista&punc; illum diligas.</HI> Cap. 4.</NOTE> <HI>and all things in it serve both our Necessity and Delight</HI>; but hence he will allow us <HI>to love them only as things Subject to, and serving of us, as the Gifts of God, re|membring that we owe them to him, and must not love them for themselves, but for him, not with him, but for him, and should love him by, and above them.</HI> And this I think may be sufficient to acquaint us with the Opinion of St. <HI>Austin</HI> in this Matter.</P>
<P>I am only farther to acquaint the Rea|der, that the Substance of many of these
<PB REF="6">
Arguments was sent to Mr. <HI>N.</HI> long be|fore his <HI>Letters</HI> appeared in Print, and seeing he thought none of them wor|thy of the least notice, I humbly offer them to the Reader, (especially to the Ingenuous Author of the late Discourse concerning the Love of God, to whom I own my self obliged) and rest.</P>

<LABEL><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The Question, Whether we are obliged to love God, so entirely, as that we may love nothing else with a love of Desire, &sect;. <HI>1.</HI> This Assertion is shew'd to be contrary, <HI>1st.</HI> To our Prayers for our daily Bread, &sect;. <HI>2. 2dly,</HI> To God's Promises of temporal good Things, &sect;. <HI>3.</HI> And to his Threats of temporal Evils, &sect;. <HI>4. 3dly,</HI> To the Repre|sentation of them as God's Gifts and Blessings, and our good Things, &sect;. <HI>5.</HI> To God's Command to rejoice in them, &sect;. <HI>6.</HI> To the Industry re|quired by God to procure these things, and his Blessing promised to that Industry, &sect;. <HI>7.</HI> Proofs from Reason, That God hath not absolutely for|bidden the Desire of Pleasure, of Honour, or of temporal Enjoyments, &sect;. <HI>8. Corollaries: 1.</HI> That this Doctrine is inconsistent with our Obligation to Pray, and with the Prayers of our own, and of Ancient Liturgies. <HI>2.</HI> With the Praises due to God for temporal Blessings, and with the Thanksgivings for them used in our Liturgy. <HI>3.</HI> It tends to depreciate the Divine Gifts, to teach Men to slight God's Promises, and contemn his Threats. <HI>4.</HI> To destroy all In|dustry in our Calling. <HI>5.</HI> It lays the vilest Im|putation upon the Dispensations of God's Provi|dence towards&punc; us, &sect;. <HI>9.</HI></LABEL>
<ITEM><HI>Page 1</HI></ITEM>
<LABEL><PB REF="7"><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> To avoid the seeming Inconsistence betwixt the Love of God only, and the Love of my Neighbour as my self, it is said, That the Love of God with all our Heart enjoined in the First Command|ment, is the Love of Desire; the Love of my Neighbour required in the Second, is only Love of Benevolence, &sect;. <HI>1.</HI> To take off this Evasion it is proved, <HI>First,</HI> That the Love of God re|quired in the Injunction to love him with all our Hearts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> cannot be discharged by a Love of Desire only, but requires also a Love of Benevo|lence, &sect;. <HI>2. Secondly,</HI> That though the Love of our Neighbour here enjoined be not love of Desire of him as our Good, yet neither is it love of Benevolence, or wishing well to him only, but to the due performance of it, a desire of the Creature is necessary, &sect;. <HI>3. Thirdly,</HI> That the Love of our selves, our Relatives, our Neigh|bour, and our Friend (all which, saith Mr. <HI>N.</HI> is love of Benevolence only) is indeed that Love which chiefly opposes, and obstructs our Love to God, and is the rise of our inordinate Affecti|ons to the World, &sect;. <HI>4. Fourthly,</HI> That tho' the Command to Love our Neighbour as our selves, doth not require us to Love our Neigh|bour as our Good, yet is not only lawful, but very commendable so to do, &sect;. <HI>5.</HI> This Doctrine, That the Love of God is entirely exclusive of all Love to, and Desire of the Creature, destroys the Foundation of these two great Virtues, Iustice and Charity, &sect;. <HI>6.</HI> It also casts a great Con|tempt upon the Works both of Creation and of Providence, &sect;. <HI>7.</HI></LABEL>

<LABEL><PB REF="7"><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> The ordinary Exposition of these Words, <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart,</HI> &amp;c. laid down in the Words of Mr. <HI>N.</HI> and of the Scoolmen, <HI>viz.</HI> That we are obliged by them to love God above all Things; <HI>1.</HI> Appretiative|ly; <HI>2.</HI> Comparatively; <HI>3.</HI> Intensively; and, <HI>4.</HI> So as to love other things only by way of Re|lation, and Subordination to God. &sect;. <HI>1.</HI> That our Lord Christ hath approved of this Exposition is shewed, &sect;. <HI>2.</HI> The Censure which Mr. <HI>N.</HI> gives of this Opinion, and the Abettors of it, re|flects very unbecomingly upon all the Prelates and Pastors of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which are not of his Mind, and lays unworthy Imputa|tions on them, &sect;. <HI>3.</HI> Some General Considera|tions offered to engage him to abate somewhat of his Confidence, and his Censorious Reflections for the future, &sect;. <HI>4.</HI> Especially this, That they who adhere to the common Exposition of these Words, differ no more from him, than he differs from his former self, Sect. <HI>5.</HI> The common Expo|sition further confirmed; <HI>First,</HI> From this Con|sideration, That this Command was given to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, whose Promises were chiefly Temporal, and therefore could not be exclusive of the desire of Temporal Blessings, Sect. <HI>6.</HI> That therefore it ought to bear that Sense, which is the certain Import of the like Phrases in all the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> where they are only to be found, which Sense is plainly opposite to that which Mr. <HI>N.</HI> contends for, Sect. <HI>7.</HI> The true Sense of loving God with all the Heart and Soul in the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> shew'd from that primary Re|lation,
<PB REF="8">
and respect it hath to their owning God to be the true God, in opposition to all strange Gods, &sect;. <HI>8. Secondly,</HI> From this Considera|tion, That this Love is required as the Condition of Salvation, &sect;. <HI>9. Thirdly,</HI> That to love God with all our Mind cannot bear this Sense, &sect;. <HI>10.</HI> The common Exposition serves all the Designs of Religion in General, and of Christian Religion in Particular, as well as the Exposition of Mr. <HI>N.</HI> and the Lady, &sect;. <HI>11.</HI></LABEL>

<LABEL><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> This Chapter contains an Answer to Mr. <HI>N.</HI>'s Ar|guments from Scripture, for a Love of God ex|clusive of all love of Desire of the Creature; as, <HI>V. G. 1st.</HI> From these Words, <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Matth. 22.37. &sect;. 1. 2dly.</HI> From those Words of St. <HI>James, Ye Adulterers and Adulteresses, know ye not that the Friendship of this World is Enmity to God,</HI> Iames <HI>4.4 &sect;. 2. 3dly,</HI> From these Words of St. <HI>John, Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World, 1</HI> Iohn <HI>2.15. &sect;. 3.</HI> And to his Arguments against the Relative Love of the Creature, <HI>V.

Object. 2.</HI> If Creatures be truly and properly lovely, as being our true and pro|per Good, they are to be loved absolutely and for themselves; if not, they are not to be loved
<PB REF="8">
at all. <HI>Answered,</HI> By shewing in what Sense they may be stiled our true and proper Good, and be loved for themselves, <HI>viz</HI> as that imports a love of them only for that Goodness God hath put into them; and how they may not be loved ab|solutely, and for themselves, <HI>viz.</HI> as that ex|cludes the Subordination of that Affection to the Love of God, &sect;. <HI>5.</HI></LABEL>

This is Exa|min'd and Confuted, &sect;. <HI>1. Argument 1.</HI> That God is the sole Cause of our Love, and therefore hath the sole Right to it. Answered, &sect;. <HI>2. Ar|gument 2.</HI> The Motion of the Will is Good in General, <HI>i. e.</HI> to all Good, and therefore to God only. Answered, &sect; <HI>3. Argument 3.</HI> God is the end of our Love, since he cannot act for a Creature, but only for himself; or move us to a Creature, but only to himself. Answer'd, &sect;. <HI>4. Argument 4.</HI> That God cannot be loved too much, nor the World too little. Answered, &sect;. <HI>5. Argument 5.</HI> That God having called us thus to the Love of himself, cannot after|wards send us to a Creature, &sect;. <HI>6. Argu|ment 6.</HI> A Man cannot repent of placing his whole Affection upon God, or have any thing to Answer for on that account. Answered, &sect;. <HI>7.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE love of a Being infinitely Excel|lent in himself, and infinitely Bene|ficial to us, is so much our Duty and so much our Interest, 'tis such an excellent preservative against the Charms of sinful Plea|sures, and all the Lures of those Temptations which tend to the destruction of our precious Souls;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> Hier. in Carm. Pyth. p. 3.</NOTE> such a powerful incentive to that Obe|dience and Holiness, which will most cer|tainly conclude in everlasting Happiness; such a constraining motive to that assimulation to God, which renders us partakers of the Di|vine Nature, and by the <HI>Heathen Moralists</HI> is truly stiled <HI>The Perfection of Man</HI>: 'Tis such a Treasury of inward Satisfactions, and ravish|ing Delights; such a <HI>Feast of Marrow and Fat|ness</HI>; such a soveraign Antidote against the Miseries and Evils of this present Life; such a Spring of sweet Contentment under all Conditions, and of entire resignation to the Will of our Beloved, that a good Man cannot, without Reluctancy of Mind, and secret Re|gret, seem to dislike any Opinions or Hypo|theses which are honestly designed to advance
<PB N="3" REF="10">
it to the highest pitch. And did I not cer|tainly believe, that the Measures of Divine Love I approve of, and contend for, serve all those glorious Ends, and minister as properly and fully to kindle and advance within us this divine Affection, as do those high and im|practicable Stretches to which my worthy Friend, and this Incomparable Lady, with so great Beauty of Expressions, and with as hearty Zeal, have laboured to scrue it up; and that they do all this without those Incon|veniencies to which their singular Hypothesis seems evidently exposed; and without those Temptations it may minister to Men not well affected unto Piety, and without those Mis|bodings it may create in those who are reli|giously enclined, I should not have given my self the uneasie task of contradicting the Opi|nions of Persons I so highly and so justly love and honour; or the Fatigue of canvasing the ensuing Question so fully as these Papers do, I hope, without offence to either of the Per|sons concerned; because with all the Defe|rence I can shew to their great Endowments, and their great Works, The Question then is this,</P>
<P>Quest.<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Whether the Scripture doth require us to love God so entirely, as that we may love nothing else with a love of desire, though it be only with Sub|ordination to him?</HI> So the philosophical and di|vine Letters dogmatically do assert; declar|ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pref. P.</HI> 132.</NOTE> That <HI>the love of God is exclusive of all other love</HI>; that it requires us <HI>in Iustice to withdraw every straggling desire from the Creature</HI>; and that <HI>it is clear from the letter of the Command|ment,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 4.</NOTE>
<PB N="4" REF="11">
<HI>that God is not only the Principal, but the sole Object of our Love.</HI> Whence it must fol|low, that every degree of desire of any Crea|ture is a sin, as being a transgression of this Precept. 2<HI>dly,</HI> Hence it must follow, that this sin is plain Idolatry; for Idolatry consists in giving that Reverence and Affection to the Creature, which is due only to the Creator. If therefore no degree of love, or of desire, be due unto the Creature, but to the Creator only, by loving or desiring the Creature in any degree whatsoever, we must give the affection to the Creature which is only due to the Creator, and therefore must be guilty of Idolatry. Hence sutably to their Opinion 'tis asserted,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 62.</NOTE> That <HI>the Creatures are no more our Goods, than our Gods; and we may as well wor|ship them, as love them.</HI> And again, <HI>p.</HI> 77, 78. <HI>As to worship the Creature, though but rela|tively, is to give that worship to the Creature which is proper to God; so to love the Crea|ture, though but relatively, is to give that love to the Creature which is proper to God. I cannot see why one should not be reckoned Idolatry, as well as the other.</HI> Now Idolatry in the <HI>New Testament</HI> is frequently declared to be a damn|ing sin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 6.9, 10. Gal. 5.19. Eph. 5.5. Col. 3.5.</NOTE> which <HI>they that do shall not inherit the Kingdom of God: No Idolater having any inhe|ritance in the Kingdom of God, or of Christ,</HI> but in the <HI>lake of fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</HI> So that, according to this new Divinity, if I desire Fire as my good, when I am starved with cold, I shall be <HI>cast into Hell fire</HI>: And if I love a Woman, and so desire her for a Wife, I must be excluded from Heaven because I love, and I desire a Crea|ture.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="11">Moreover these Letters lay this down for <HI>certain,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 203.</NOTE> That <HI>he that desires any thing besides God, whatever he pretends, or however he deceives him|self, does not truly love God.</HI> And, that <HI>when|ever the Soul moves toward the Creature, it must necessarily forsake the Creator</HI>; and that <HI>it can never truly turn to him without a dereliction of all besides him.</HI> Now, if it <HI>cannot truly love him,</HI> it never can be loved by him, if it can never <HI>truly turn to him,</HI> it can never be converted, and so it never can be saved; if it <HI>forsake the Creator,</HI> by desiring, <HI>or moving towards any Creature,</HI> it must perish; for, saith the Pro|phet, <HI>all that forsake thee shall be ashamed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 1.28. Jer. 17.13.</NOTE> <HI>and consumed.</HI> Now is it not strange Doctrine to affirm as <HI>certain,</HI> That we cannot truly love God, if we desire our daily bread; that I for|sake God, if I move towards meat when I am hungry, or drink when I am thirsty? Such Doctrines as these tend plainly to per|swade Men, that God requires what they find opposite to their very Constitution, and Be|ing in this World, and so impossible for them to perform and live; and this must render the highest act of our Religion, the divine Love, ridiculous to some, and drive the weaker sort of People into despair, by giving them occa|sion to think they do not love God truly, or as they ought, because they, by experience, find they love a Dish of good Meat, and a Cup of good Drink, and cannot but desire the one when they are hungry, and the other when thirsty.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 2.</NOTE><HI>First,</HI> It is manifestly and expresly contrary to the plain Dictates of the Holy Scripture, and the Experience and Reason of Mankind. To make this evident, I lay this down as the Foundation, That love of Concupiscence, and of Desire, are the same; Desire being in Eng|lish the same which <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <HI>Concupiscentia</HI> are in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theory of Love, p,</HI> 12, 14.</NOTE> <HI>Love is,</HI> saith Mr. <HI>N. a motion of the Soul towards Good, and thus con|sid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">red it is what we call Concupiscence, or Desire.</HI> Now hence it necessarily follows, that what I desire, I do also love; and that I may inno|cently love, what I may lawfully desire to

have, or to enjoy. Now God himself by divers Methods hath instructed us, that we may lawfully desire the Creature He hath himself obliged us to desire, and therefore moderately to effect the World's good Things.</P>
<P>For, 1. He hath made the desire of them the matter of our daily Prayer, requiring us to address unto him daily for <HI>our daily Bread.</HI> Now under the name of Bread it is agreed by all Interpreters that I have met with, that all things needful to the sustaining and the com|fort of this present Life are comprehended; of which nature are Meat, Drink, and Clo|thing. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 6.32</NOTE> saith our Saviour, <HI>your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of All these things.</HI> Moreover, the Reason why we are to desire Bread being this, because 'tis needful for the Support and Comfort of this present Life; it follows that we have the same reason to desire of God what ever else is needful to the Support and Comfort of this Life: And so to beg his Blessing not only on our honest Labours, and endeavours to obtain and to preserve what is needful for the Support and Comfort of our selves, and our dependants, but also on our Flocks and Herds, and on all those Fruits of the Earth he hath provided for the use of Man.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">.

Eccles. p. 634.</NOTE> Prayer therefore being <HI>the desire of some good thing from God,</HI> two things are evident, which destroy the Foundation of
<PB N="8" REF="13">
this Imagination; 1. That our Bread is our Good. 2. That we may lawfully desire, and therefore love all that in this Petition is com|prehended under the name of daily Bread.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 4.3, 4, 5.</NOTE>Again, St. <HI>Paul</HI> condemns those <HI>Hereticks</HI> who taught Men <HI>to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with thanks|giving of them who believe, and know the truth</HI>; (<HI>viz.</HI> that nothing is unclean of it self, <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.14.) <HI>For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.

Here then again we learn, First, That every Creature of God is good; <HI>i. e.</HI> is good for Food to be received by us, and therefore for our Food, and consequent|ly for good; and why else is it to be received with thanksgiving; for what we are obliged to thank him for is sure his Blessing, and our good. Secondly, Hence we learn also, That every Creature which is thus good for us, must be desired of God, it being Sancti|fied or fitted for our use, <GAP DESC="foreign">, by <HI>Intercession to God</HI> for the Enjoyment of it.</P>

We therefore by these Promises are taught of God to love, and to desire the good things of this present Life.</P>
<P>Moreover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 10.29, 30.</NOTE> our blessed Saviour promiseth to them who forsake <HI>Houses</HI> and <HI>Lands</HI> and <HI>Life, for his sake</HI> and <HI>the Gospel's, an hundred fold here, and afterwards eternal life.</HI> Now, if none of these things are fit to be the Objects of our Love, if they be not desirable to us, why doth Christ promise such an immense Reward to those that do forsake, and quit them for his sake? Why doth he promise, as an Encou|ragement to do so, the Return of them <HI>an hundred fold</HI>; since what we are not to affect, or to desire at all, of that we are not to affect or to desire the Encrease? Or why doth <HI>Peter</HI> say to Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>v.</HI> 28.</NOTE> <HI>We have left all</HI> (these things) <HI>and followed thee, what shall we have?</HI> Doth not the Question plainly suppose, That leaving of these things was that for which they might
<PB N="10" REF="14">
expect a Recompence? Which sure they could not do for leaving only that which was not in it self desirable, which was not good, and so could be no proper Object of their Love. Wherefore by these Expressions our Saviour plainly doth instruct us that these are in some degree desirable, and proper Objects of our Love. Again, when the Psalmist, to engage Men to keep God's Commandments, saith, <HI>More to be desired are they then gold,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 19.10. Ps. 119.127.</NOTE> <HI>yea, then much fine gold</HI>; and testifies of himself thus, <HI>I love thy Commandments above Gold, yea, above fine Gold</HI>; do not these things suppose that Gold in some degree might be desired, and loved?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 63.3.

Doth it not suppose that there be ma|ny things that may be desired? In fine, when Christ declares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10.37.</NOTE> That <HI>he who loveth Father or Mother, Wife or Children, or even his own Life, more then him, is not worthy of him</HI>; does not he tacitly suppose that 'tis as natural to love, and to desire the Continuance of Life, as to love Father and Mother; and that this Love is only Vicious when it exceeds or rivals that Affection which we owe to him?</P>

Or why doth <HI>Solomon</HI> so earnestly desire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 8.36, 37, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> That God, upon their Prayer, and their Repentance, would grant Deliverance from the forementioned Evils?</P>
<P>Again, this is one of God's Motives to en|gage his People to depart from evil, That <HI>their iniquities witheld good things from them,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 5.25.

If they were not fit Objects of Desire, where is the punishment in the withdrawing them? or where is the motive to depart from evil, that they might prevent these things?</P>
<P N="4">4. God hath sufficiently informed us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect; 5.</NOTE> That these things are truly good for, and fit to be desired by us, by declaring, That they are his

Blessings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Chron. 29.12. Hos. 8.2. Pro. 10.22. Deut. 8.18.

Can we more effectually depreciate his Gifts, or un|dervalue his Blessings, than by saying that there is nothing in them which deserves to be esteem|ed our Good, or ought to be desired of those that love him.</P>
<P>Moreover, how positive soever these Meta|physical Men are, that these are not our Goods, the holy Scripture is as positive to the contra|ry; For in the Story of <HI>Lot,</HI> we have twice mention of <HI>his Goods</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 14 12, 16.

<PB N="13" REF="15">
shew that in the Language of the holy Ghost, whatever <HI>Metaphysicks</HI> may say to the contrary, these outward Blessings were their Goods. Moreover, the wise Man frequently informs us, That it is the <HI>Good of man to eat and drink,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccl. 2.24, 3.12, 13.22. <HI>ch.</HI> 5.18, 19. <HI>ch.</HI> 8.15.</NOTE> <HI>and make his soul enjoy the good of all his labour.</HI></P>
<P>That this is his <HI>Portion.</HI> To receive them, is to <HI>receive good at the hand of God,</HI> Job 2.10. to be silled with them, is <HI>to be filled with good|ness,</HI> Psal. 107.9. Jer. 31.14. to use them freely, is to <HI>fill our soul with good,</HI> Eccl. 6.3. to promise these things, is <HI>to promise good to them,</HI> Deut. 30 9.

All which Expressions are a perfect Demonstration, That these temporal Enjoy|ments are, in the Language of the Scripure, our Good things, and therefore may be lo|ved and desired as our Goods. Moreover, the Apostle makes the giving of these tempo|ral Blessings to the Heathen World the Te|stimony of God's Goodness to them; <HI>He hath not,</HI> saith he, <HI>left himself without a Witness <GAP DESC="foreign">, doing them good,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 14.17.</NOTE> <HI>in giving them rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling their hearts with food and gladness.</HI> This also by our Saviour is represented as a Demonstration of God's Love to all, <HI>That he maketh his Sun to rise on the evil and the good,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 5.45.</NOTE> <HI>and sendeth rain on the just, and on the unjust.</HI> By this he shew|eth <HI>himself kind to the unthankful,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 6.35.</NOTE> <HI>and to the evil.</HI> They therefore who do absolutely deny that

Eph. 4.28.</NOTE> in which he must <HI>abide</HI>; he is exhorted <HI>with quietness to work, and eat his own bread</HI>; and <HI>to do his own business, working with his hands,</HI> or <HI>working <GAP DESC="foreign">, that which is good, with his hands</HI>; and <HI>if he will not labour,</HI> when he can,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thes. 3.10.</NOTE> the Apostles Canon saith <HI>he must not eat</HI> when he would. Moreover, though we bring nothing into the World, yet we bring Ap|petites, which have no other use but to desire these Temporals, and Constitutions which cannot at all subsist, or not conveniently, without them; which therefore were undoubt|edly designed to prompt us to that Industry by which alone we can obtain them. We have hands also suted for Work, and Strength enabling us to labour, and Reason to contrive how to employ that Labour in procuring the things we want. All which things shew, even without a Revelation, That Divine Wisdom did intend that we should live in the Exercise of Industry to procure these things, and not well without it; having so many Desires to be appeased, so many Wants to be supplied, so many Troubles to be removed, so many Ap|petites
<PB N="17" REF="17">
and Senses to be gratified by our Care and Industry, in the pursuit of these things. But now imagin these temporal Enjoyments not to our good, not proper Objects of our Desire, not worthy of the name of temporal Blessings, you cut off all Motives to this Industry; for where there is no proper Fruits of Industry, nothing which is <HI>Operae pretium, worth the labour,</HI> there can be no cause of Labour: Now where there is nothing good for me, nothing desira|ble, no Blessing to be obtained by Labour, 'tis certain that there is no ground or motive un|to Labour. And therefore, to excite us to this Industry, God hath engaged to give to the diligent pursuit of these things, 1 Prosperous Success,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 13.4.</NOTE> declaring, That <HI>the soul of the diligent shall be made fat,</HI> whilst <HI>the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing</HI>: 2 Plentiful Accommodations for our Sustenance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 21.5.</NOTE> for as <HI>The thoughts of the dili|gent tend only to plenteousness,</HI> so hath God assu|red him of Satisfaction from it; for he that <HI>tilleth his Land shall be satisfied with bread.</HI> 3.

<P>But had we no such evidence of these things from Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 8.</NOTE> even Reason and Experience would powerfully convince us.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="18"><HI>First,</HI> That God hath not forbidden the Desire, or denied us the Enjoyment of any worldly Pleasure, which is truly <GAP DESC="foreign">, a Pleasure that doth call for no Re|pentance, because his all wise Providence hath made such liberal Provisions for them.

Did he not give us the free use of these Enjoyments, provided that we take this freedom with Moderation and Discretion, use it with Thankfulness, and with Submission, and Subordination to the Glory of the Donor?

I must have therefore implant|ed in me by the God of Nature, as many na|tural Desires of the Creature, as I have natural Appetites, which may and only can be grati|fied by the Enjoyment of the Creature.</P>
<P>What therefore doth the good Lady mean when she affirms so positively,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 9. <HI>p.</HI> 179.</NOTE> That <HI>if he de|sire

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He cannot absolutely have forbid|den the desire of Honour; for if so, why hath he planted in us such a natural thirst after it? Why doth he promise it so oft as the reward of Wisdom?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 22.1.</NOTE> Why hath he told us, <HI>A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches</HI>; that it is <HI>better than the precious Ointment?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 7.1.</NOTE> Why hath he made it our Duty to pursue whatever is <HI>praise-worthy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip. 4.8.</NOTE> <HI>honourable, and of good report?</HI> Why hath he made it a commendation of Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 11.2.</NOTE> that by it <HI>the Elders obtained a good re|port?</HI> Why hath he ordered matters so, as to

render a good Reputation, and an honourable Esteem so highly instrumental to promote his Glory, and so beneficial to our selves and others, that great and good things can scarce successfully be done without it? And,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> As for temporal good Things; he by making such rich Provisions of them for the Sustenance of our lives, and by framing our Bodies so as not only to relish and delight in them, but also to be nourished and sustain|ed by them, hath sufficiently intimated that it is his pleasure that we should in reasonable measure desire and enjoy them, otherwise his care would have been vain, and his works useless; yea, he might seem to have laid an ill design to tempt and ensnare us, and draw us off from himself by them. In fine, when we come into the World in the want of all things, with Appetites which have no other use but to desire them, and cannot but be pleased with them; when we have Natures that cannot long, or conveniently subsist without them; when the Organs of our Senses are so framed, as naturally to be delighted with them; when the wise Providence of God hath framed the whole Earth for satisfa|ction of those Appetites; when by the Order of Providence from the Creation, all Men do pursue them, and even good Men pray unto God, and do praise him for them, can it be needful to spend more words in confutation of a Paradox, which all Men do renounce in Speculation or in Practice; or to evince that God hath not entirely forbid all love, and all desire of the World's good Things. Now hence it follows;</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="19"><HI>First,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 9.</NOTE> That this Doctrine is inconsistent with our Obligation to pray for any temporal Bles|sings which we want either for our selves, or others.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Kings 8.</NOTE> Whosoever looks into the Prayer of Dedication, made by <HI>Solomon,</HI> will find it is imploy'd in begging temporal Mercies for the <HI>Iews</HI> in answer to their Prayer, <HI>viz.</HI> in ask|ing deliverance from that <HI>Pestilence</HI> which de|stroyed their Lives; that <HI>Famine, Mildew, Bla|sting, Locust</HI> which consumed their Fruit, that <HI>Drought</HI> which consumed their Drink, and that <HI>Exile</HI> which deprived them of that good Land which <HI>flowed with Milk and Honey.</HI> The <HI>Ancient Liturgies</HI> pray'd always thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Dr.</HI> Com|ber, <HI>comp. part</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 178.</NOTE> <HI>Let us beseech the Lord to give us a temperate Air, gentle Showers, refreshing Dews, and plenty of all Fruits; so that the year may afford us store of all good things, and abundance of all Provisions.</HI> In our Liturgy we pray that God would <HI>give and preserve to us the kindly Fruits of the Earth, so as in due time we may enjoy them:</HI> That the King may <HI>study to preserve his People in Wealth, Peace and Godliness:</HI> That <HI>we may receive the Fruits of the Earth to our comfort:</HI> That God would <HI>encrease the Fruits of the Earth by his heavenly Benediction, and turn our great Scarcity and Dearth into Plenty and Cheapness.</HI> Now, seeing Prayer is a desire of some good thing from God, if these Enjoyments be not our good things, if we may not desire or affect them, we cannot thus address unto God for them.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> This Doctrine is inconsistent with that Praise, and that Thanksgiving which we owe to God for all the Mercies we enjoy.
<PB N="22" REF="20">

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> This Doctrine tends to depreciate the divine Gifts, to undervalue all God's tem|poral Blessings, to cause Men to despise and slight his temporal Promises, and to contemn his threats of the same kind, and render both

unable to obtain the ends his Wisdom hath de|signed in making them; for what greater contempt can we cast upon the divine Gifts? how can we more effectually vilifie the divine Blessings, or slight these Promises, than by thus solemnly declaring they contain nothing in them which a good Man can desire or affect?

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> This Doctrine tends to destroy all Industry in our Calling, and all pursuit of temporal Enjoyments by our honest Labour:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 7. <HI>p.</HI> 132.</NOTE> For let me <HI>totally withdraw every straggling de|sire from the Creature,</HI> and surely I shall be so <HI>kind to my self</HI> as to withdraw my labour from it.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Let..</HI> 9. <HI>p.</HI> 179.</NOTE> If <HI>in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eason Creatures not to be thought de|sirable,</HI> 'tmust be unreasonable to toil and la|bour for them, and to <HI>eat them in the sweat of our brows:</HI> If none of these Enjoyments be worth my labour, surely I have no ground to labour for them; now where there is nothing good to me, nothing desirable to be obtained by Labour, there can be nothing worth my labour.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="21"><HI>Fifthly,</HI> This Doctrine lays the vilest impu|tations upon the dispensations of God's Provi|dence towards us.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argument</HI> 2. &sect;. 1.</NOTE>I Proceed now to my Second Head, <HI>viz.</HI> to shew, that this Exposition of the Precept, <HI>to love God with all our hearts,</HI> renders it con|trary to the following Command, enjoining us <HI>to love our Neighbour as our selves.</HI> That this is a just Prejudice, if true, against this new Invention the Admirable Lady confesseth, and confirmeth in these words;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 7. <HI>P.</HI> 135, 136.</NOTE>
<Q>It were, I con|fess, a strong prejudice against their way of stating the Love of God, if it were in any measure injurious to the right Under|standing and due performance of the love we owe to our Neighbour. For since the Precepts of the Gospel are an exact and beautiful System of Wisdom and Per|fection; every one of whose Parts are so duly proportioned to the other, that the result of all is perfect Harmony and Order. I must needs conclude, that when such a sense is put upon one Precept as causes it to clash and interfere with another, it can|not be the genuine meaning of it; and if I cannot make over the whole of my desire to God, without defaulking from that por|tion of love he has assigned my Neighbour, I must of necessity set the signification of that Precept to a lower pitch, and find out some other Medium to interpret the first and great Commandment.</Q>
But then they think to salve the matter with the distinction of love, into love of desire, and love of Be|nevolence; declaring that the former is due
<PB N="29" REF="23">
to God alone, and is the thing required in the Commandment, <HI>to love God with all our hearts</HI>; the second only belongeth to our Neighbour, and is the thing enjoined in the Command, <HI>to love our Neighbour as our selves.</HI> Thus Mr. <HI>N.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 8. <HI>P.</HI> 154, 155, 156. <HI>See P.</HI> 71, 72.</NOTE>
<Q>'Tis most certain, that the most entire love of God, enjoined in the first Commandment, does by no means exclude the love of our Neighbour&punc; enjoined in the second, in case these two loves be of two different kinds; the former suppose love of Desire, and the latter love of Bene|volence, there being no manner of Repug|nancy between the desiring none <HI>but God, and the wishing well to Men.</HI> Thus, <HI>saith he,</HI> is it in this case; for the word Love, when applied to God in the First Command|ment, signifies desiring him as a good; and when applied to Men, in the Second, (it) signifies not desiring them as a good, but desiring good to them: And cannot I thus love God only, and my Neighbour too, and so fulfil both Commands? Cannot I desire but one thing only in the World, and yet at the same time wish well to every thing else? 'Tis plain that I may, and that the entireness of my love to God, does no way prejudice my love to my Neigh|bour; supposing the latter love to be of a different kind from the former.</Q>
Now in Answer to these Suggestions I shall endeavour to shew.</P>

<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> That the love of Benevolence allow|ed by Mr. <HI>N.</HI> and his good <HI>Lady,</HI> is indeed that love which chiefly opposeth and ob|structeth our true love to God, and is the rise of our inordinate Affections to the World.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> That though this Precept, <HI>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self,</HI> cannot be well supposed to command us <HI>to desire our Neigh|bour as our good,</HI> yet is it not only lawful, but very commendable so to do.</P>

<P>The Excellent Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI> not only makes it one Property of true Love to God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm.</HI> 23. <HI>of the Love of God, Vol.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 316.</NOTE> <HI>to bear the greatest good will towards him,</HI> but also saith, <HI>There wants not sufficient matter of exer|cising good will, both in Affection and Action to|wards God;</HI> (for) <HI>we are capable both of wish+ing, and in a manner, as he will interpret it, and accept it, of doing good&punc; to him by our concur|rence with him in promoting those things which he approves and delights in, and in removing the contrary.</HI> Moreover when Christ saith, <HI>He that loveth Father and Mother,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10.37.</NOTE> <HI>Wife or Children, or his own Life more more than me, is not worthy of me:</HI> Doth not the comparison require, that the Love mentioned should relate to the same kind of love? If then the love of Fa|ther and and Mother be only that of Bene|volence, and the love of God and Christ be that of Desire only, let Mr. <HI>N.</HI> tell us why they may not both be very well consistent, as well as the love of God, and of our Neigh|bour are upon that account believed to be so, if the love of both be that of desire, it follows, in opposition to his Grand Tenet,
<PB N="33" REF="25">
that Creatures may be loved with love of Desire; but if the love here mentioned be that of Benevolence, then is it certain that love of Benevolence is not only due to God, but also that it is due to him in an higher measure than to any Creature. And indeed this Matter needs to be explained a little, and then it will scarce need a further Confir|mation</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Then we may consider God in his Divine Essence, as an All-sufficient God, in|finitely happy in himself, and incapable of any accession either to his Being, or internal Happiness; and in this sense to wish well to him, or to desire to him Good, is vain and impracticable; and therefore considered thus, he is incapable of Love of Benevo|lence.</P>
<P>But then we may consider him as the great Governor of the World, giving Laws, which he would have us to observe, and by Obe|dience to which he is glorified by Men, and is well pleased when they do chearfully and readily comply with them, and is dis|honoured and displeased when they affront him by their Disobedience.</P>
<P>We also may consider him according to his immitable Perfections, and his communi|cable Attributes, <HI>viz.</HI> his Holiness and Righte|ousness, his Truth and Faithfulness, his Good|ness and Mercy. Now these being the Ex|cellencies and Perfections of his own Na|ture, which he cannot chuse but love and delight in, he is pleased to express himself as one who very much desires that all his Sub|jects should be like him in them, and to
<PB N="34" REF="26">
delight in all that are so, and who endea|vours to make others so; he being glorified by them who promote these Excellencies in themselves, and others, and as one who is highly offended, displeased, and even grieved when Men neglect these things, and act in opposition to his great Design of promoting these Perfections in Mankind; and thus he is very capable of our Love of Benevo|lence: For whenever we do him service out of good will, and pure desire to please him; when we aspire to greater measures of Holi|ness, and Righteousness, and are Fruitful in good Works, because these things are accep|table to God, and tend to the promotion of his Glory; when we endeavour that all with whom we do converse may advance in them from the same Principle; in all these cases we express our good will to him. When we are zealous for his Honour, rejoice to see it promoted, are grieved at any thing which doth dishonour and displease him, and are industrious to prevent it; in this we we shew a Zeal for God, and a displeasure against these things, arising from a love to him. And when we love his Servants for his sake, and our Neighbour, because made after the Image of God; this is in Scripture represented not only as an Indication, but an Expression of our love to him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 6.10.</NOTE> For <HI>God is not unrighteous,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>to forget your labour of love, which you have shewed to his name, in that you ministred to the Saints.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 25.40.</NOTE> And <HI>forasmuch as you did it to one of these,</HI> saith <HI>Christ, you did it unto me.</HI> And therefore <HI>Crellius</HI> and <HI>Carrellaeus</HI> do well inform us, That <HI>the love of God is

unto our selves; it also shews a stronger compliance of our Will with the Will of God, a greater Sympathy of Affections, a stronger Complacency in Goodness, an higher Resemblance of Divine Perfections, than our desire of the chief Good imports, and so it renders us more partakers of the Divine Nature, and so more acceptable and lovely in the sight of God. Love of Benevolence is therefore due to God, as well as to my my Neighbour, and so the love of God and of Neighbour is not on that account of different kinds. And if it cannot be denied that this is true and genuine love of God, it cannot be denied that this love also is required in the Command, <HI>To love the Lord with all our Heart, and all our Soul</HI>; and then it is demonstrative|ly evident, that Phrase cannot exclude the love of any Creature, because it is confessed, that with this love of Benevolence we are to <HI>love our Neighbour as our selves.</HI></P>

<PB N="37" REF="27">
<HI>affording him, <GAP DESC="foreign">, the things which are profitable to the Body,</HI> is an un|profitable piece of Charity. And yet how is it possible we should be able, or even desirous to afford him what is necessary for the Body, if we our selves may not desire the things that are so? Let us reflect upon those acts of Charity to our Neighbour, for which our Lord hath promised to us the Kingdom, and we shall easily discern we cannot do them, without desire of the Creature as their Good. For can we <HI>feed the Hungry,</HI> or <HI>give drink to the Thirsty,</HI> without desiring to have Food and Drink to give them? Can we <HI>take the Stran|ger in,</HI> without desiring an House in which we may receive him? Or <HI>Cloath the Naked,</HI> without desiring to have wherewith to Cloath him? 'Tis therefore certain, that we cannot discharge this Christian Duty to our Neigh|bour, without a desire of, and an endeavour also to enjoy the Creature, and then it must be also certain, that the Love of God is not exclusive of all love, and all desire of the Creature.</P>
<P>Besides, we by this Precept are obliged <HI>to love our Brother as our selves</HI>; now are we barely to wish well to our selves, and not de|sire Life, Health, Sleep, Ease, Comfort, and all the Necessaries of this present Life? If then we are to love our Neighbour as our selves, that love must certainly engage us to desire for our Brother the continuance of Life, Health, Ease and Comfort, and all the Neces|saries of this present Life; and also that we may have what will enable us to minister to him in these things.</P>

<Q><HI>Our love of our selves</HI> is not love of Desire, but Benevolence; for whosoever reflects upon the love of him|self, will presently perceive that 'tis not a desire of himself as his Good, but a desire of some Good to himself, as appears from the Vulgar Expression, <HI>Charity begins at Home</HI>; and from the Vice of Self-love, by which we mean <HI>a Craving,</HI> N.

<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Though Mr. <HI>N.</HI> saith, <HI>'Tis most un|doubtedly so, that my Love of my self is not Love of Desire</HI>: Both Scripture and Reason most undoubtedly declare the contrary; for Self-Preservation, and the continuance of Life, are the natural Desires of all Men: Now these are truly a Desire of our selves, that is of something of our selves which we have not

already,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm 23.15, 14.</NOTE> and yet this <HI>desire of Life, and love of many Days,</HI> being only the desire of what God doth promise as the Reward of our O|bedience; it is unquestionably the Desire of something Good for us, and so of something which Self-love doth prompt us to desire. When <HI>Christ</HI> requires us to love him more than Life it self, and God enjoins his People to obey his Precepts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 6.14. <HI>ch.</HI> 30.15.</NOTE> <HI>that they may live,</HI> do not all these things teach us, That the continu|ance of Life is a thing desirable, and that we may <HI>love many days</HI>?

<Q><P N="1"> Now
<HI>This,</HI> saith the Excellent Dr. <HI>Barrow, is the Root from which all other Vices do grow, and without which hardly any Sin could sub|sist</HI>; the chief Vices especially have an ob|vious and evident dependance upon it.</P><P>All Impiety doth involve a loving our selves in undue manner and measure, so that we set our selves in our Esteem and Affection before God; we prefer our own Conceits to his Judgment and Advice; we raise our Pleasure above his Will and Au|thority.</P><P>From hence particularly, by a manifest Extraction, are derived those chief and common Vices, Pride, Ambition, Envy, Avarice, Intemperance, Injustice, Uncha|ritableness, Peevishness, Stubbornness, Dis|content, and Impatience.
For,</P><P>We overvalue our selves, our Qualities and Endowments, our Powers and Abili|ties, our Fortunes and external Advantages; hence we are so Proud, that is, so Lofty in our Conceits, and Fastuous in our De|meanors.</P><P>We would be the only Men, or most considerable in the World; hence are we Ambitious; hence continually, with un|satiable greediness, we do affect and strive
<PB N="41" REF="29">
to procure encrease of Reputation, of Power, of Dignity.</P><P>We would engross to our selves all sorts of good Things in the highest degree; hence enviously we become jealous of the Works and Virtue we grudge, and repine at the Prosperity of others, as if they de|falked somewhat from our Excellency, or did Eclipse the brightness of our Fortune.</P><P>We desire to be not only full in our En|joyment, but free and absolute in our Do|minion of Things, not only secure from needing the Succour of other Men, but in|dependant in regard to God's Providence: Hence are we so covetous of Wealth; hence we so eagerly scrape it, and so carefully hoard it up.</P><P>We can refuse our dear selves no satis|faction, although unreasonable and hurtful, therefore we so greedily gratifie sensual Ap|petites in unlawful, or excessive Enjoy|ments of Pleasure.</P><P>Being blinded or transported with fond Dotage on our selves, we cannot discern, or will not regard what is due to others: Hence are we apt, upon occasion, to do them wrong.</P><P>Love to our selves doth in such manner suck in, and swallow up our Spirits; doth so pinch in, and contract our Hearts; doth, according to its Computation, so confine and abridge our Interests, that we cannot in our Affection, or in real expression of Kindness tend outwards, that we can afford little good Will, or impart little Good to others.</P><P><PB N="42" REF="30">
Deeming our selves extreamly Wise, and worthy of Regard; we cannot endure to be contradicted in our Opinion, or cross'd in our Honour: Hence, upon any such Occasion, our Choler riseth, and easily we break forth into violent Heats of Pas|sion.</P><P>From the like Causes it is that we can|not willingly stoop to due Obeisance of our Superiors, in Reverence to their Per|sons, and Observance of their Laws, that we cannot contentedly acquiesce in the Station or Portion assigned us by Provi|dence, that we cannot patiently support our Condition, or accept the Events be|falling us.</P><P>In fine, if surveying all the several kinds of naughty Dispositions in our Souls, and of Miscarriages in our Lives, we do scan their particular Nature, and search into their Original Causes, we shall find inor|dinate Self-love to be a main Ingredient, and a common Source of them all.</P></Q>
<P>In particular, the love of Life, which is by them esteemed Love of Benevolence, to what base Fears, and sordid Actions doth it not expose us? How many myriads have lost their Reputation, Honesty, their Consci|ence, and their own Souls to save it? This therefore is that piece of Self-denial so oft in|culcated, so vehemently pressed in Scripture, that we may continue <HI>Christ's Disciples,</HI> and may be Faithful to him to the Death. The immoderate love of it being that which is especially pronounced inconsistent with the love of God, and with Fidelity to Christ.
<PB N="43" REF="30">
Hence he so often saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10.39. <HI>ch.</HI> 16.25.</NOTE> <HI>He that findeth his own Life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 13.26.</NOTE> And <HI>if any Man come to me, and hateth not his own Life, he cannot be my Disciple.</HI> Can therefore any Person doubt whether this self-love, this love of Life, be not as much forbid by the Command of loving God with all our Hearts; as the desire of Houses, Lands, or any temporal Possessions, or think it less obstructive of, or inconsistent with it, because it is love of Benevolence? But will Mr. <HI>N.</HI> or his Good <HI>Lady,</HI> by reason of the mischievous Effects of this Self-love, this love of Life, perswade the World that no Man ought to love himself at all, or desire at all the Preservation of his Life? And yet would they be pleased to revise their Argu|ments, and those especially which are taken from the Consideration of the Danger of the Love of the Creature, they would soon per|ceive they were of equal Force against all love of our selves, and of our lives.</P>
<P>Again, the love of Parents, Children, Hus|bands, Wives, Relations, Friends, is love of Benevolence; and yet it is the Root of many and great Vices, it is that which renders it exceeding difficult to obey the Laws of Christ, when they once come in Competition with these Beloved's of our Souls; for where there is by Nature the closest Union, and the most intimate Affection, it must be very diffi|cult to burst these Bonds asunder, and disin|gage our Hearts from them. Hence that great Duty of Self-denial is still expressed by loving God more than these;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Mat. 10.37.</NOTE> for, <HI>He,</HI> saith Christ, <HI>that loveth Father and Mother, Son or

<P>Moreover, doth not Experience convince us, that from the excessive love we bear to our Relations, beloved Sects and Parties, mostly proceeds that Strife, Debate and Va|riance, those Quarrels and Contentions, that Wrath, Hatred, Envy, Bitterness of Spirit; those Schisms, Factions and Seditions; those Animosities and Heart-burnings; those Ca|lumnies, Detractions, rash Censures, which are in the World?</P>
<P>Is not this one great Root of that Avarice, that scraping for the World, that hoarding of it up, that want of Charity we complain of that Men are very desirous to advance their Families, and leave them in great Plenty and Splendor in the World?</P>
<P>Can it be therefore doubted, Whether this love of Benevolence be one great thing forbidden in this Injunction, <HI>To love the Lord with all our Heart,</HI> &amp;c. or whether it be not inconsistent with it as that love of the Crea|ture, of <HI>Houses, Lands,</HI> joined with it in the Text; which Men do often part with to preserve the Life of these Beloveds? But will Good Mr. <HI>N.</HI> or the <HI>Lady,</HI> hence conclude, That <HI>the Love of God with all our Hearts,</HI> is entirely exclusive of all Love of Benevolence to Father or Mother, Wife or Children?</P>

supposed to command us to desire our Neigh|bour as our Good; yet is it not only lawful, but very commendable so to do.</HI> I say, the Command to love our Neighbour cannot be <HI>a Command to desire him as our Good,</HI> because the love of my Neighbour is this love of another as such, the wishing well, and doing good to ano|ther, without a formal respect to my self; whereas loving another <HI>as a Good to me,</HI> is properly Self-love. The true reason then why I cannot love my Neighbour in the Sense here required, <HI>with love of desire as a Good to me,</HI> is not because he is a Creature, for I my self am a Creature, and yet may love my self, as I have proved, with a love of Desire; and I may love and desire those temporal good Things God hath promised, though they be only Creatures; but because whatsoever I thus love, must be affected, and desired from Self-love, and not from love unto another.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, it is very evident that I may, and sometimes ought to desire my Neighbour <HI>as a Good to me.</HI> For, is there not such a thing as a good Friend, a good Companion, a good Neighbour, a good Counsellor; and may not I want, and so have reason to desire this Friend, Companion, Neighbour, Counsellor, as a Good to me?

pray for the continuance and preservation of their Lives? And do we not desire this as a publick Good? And when we grieve for them as dead, and gone into a State of Hap|piness, can we do this out of Benevolence to them?

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 6.</NOTE> I add, that this Opinion, That the Love of God is absolutely exclusive of all love to, and all desire of the Creature, de|stroys the whole Foundation of these two great Virtues, Justice and Charity: For,</P>
<P N="1">1.

Nor if I suffer them to be impair'd, can I have any inward Sense, that I do that to others which I would not have done unto my own self.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P>The Providence of God respects his Preser|vation, and his Government of all things, and with relation to both these we have have just cause to say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 33.5.</NOTE> <HI>The Earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.</HI> For he <HI>preserveth Man and Beast</HI>; and this he doth by giving and continuing to them Life and Breath, and all things.

<P>As for the other Act of Providence, God's Government of Mankind, who knows not that the great Objection made against it both
<PB N="52" REF="35">
by <HI>Iew</HI> and <HI>Heathen</HI> was this, That it so often hapned to the Wicked to abound in temporal good Things, and to the Good to be afflict|ed with great Misery and Want; That such was <HI>the Prosperity of the wicked,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 73.7, 12.</NOTE> that <HI>their eyes stood out with fulness,</HI> and <HI>they had more than heart could wish</HI>; that <HI>they prospered in the world, and encreased in Riches</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 12.1.</NOTE> That <HI>the way of the wick|ed prospered, and they were happy who dealt very treacherously:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 21.7, 13.</NOTE> That they continued <HI>to old age, mighty in power, safe</HI> from fear, free from <HI>the rod of God, spending their days in mirth and wealth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 73.14.</NOTE> Whereas <HI>many</HI> were <HI>the afflictions of the Righteous,</HI> they being <HI>plagued all the day long,</HI> and <HI>chastned every morning.</HI> That <HI>there is a just man who perisheth in his righteousness,</HI> and <HI>there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wick|edness.</HI> That there <HI>be just men to whom it hap|peneth according to the work of the wicked.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 7.15. <HI>ch.</HI> 8.14.</NOTE> <HI>A|gain, there be wicked men to whom it hapneth according to the work of the righteous.</HI> Now had it not been generally received as a certain truth, that these external things were our Good, that they were proper Objects of our Desire and Affection, and that the want of them was the want of what was good and fit to be desired, there could have been no foundation for this Objection against Providence.

And,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 1.</NOTE><HI>First,</HI> The great Objection insisted on from Scripture ariseth from the words of Christ, <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 22.37.</NOTE> <HI>and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</HI> Now to fix the true sense of these words I shall

<ITEM>1<HI>st,</HI> Lay down the ordinary Exposition of them, and offer some Arguments to confirm it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2<HI>dly,</HI> I shall consider and confute the Novel Exposition of Mr. <HI>N.</HI> and answer what
<PB N="55" REF="36">
he offers against the commonly received In|terpretation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Now the ordinary Exposition of these words, saith Mr. <HI>N.</HI> is by the generality of Divines express'd thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vol.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 5.</NOTE> (1<HI>st,</HI>)
<Q>That we are to love God with a superlative Affection, so as to be ready always to prefer his Favour be|fore all other things; to chuse to obey him, rather than man; to please him, rather than to gratifie our selves; to enjoy him, rather than any carnal Interest whatsoever; and so as to be ready, rather to lose any temporal good, or suffer any temporal Evil, than commit the least Sin against him. (2<HI>dly,</HI>) That we are to love other things only in a way of Relation and Subordina|tion to God;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 75.</NOTE> for seeing God requires us to love him with all our hearts, our love to other things must be derived from, and dependant on our love to God, and we must only love them for his sake, as they relate unto him, or as they enable us to serve him, or as they are instrumental to the Enjoyment of him.</Q>
This by the <HI>School-men,</HI> and <HI>Systematical Divines,</HI> is thus ex|pressed.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That we are to love God above all things <HI>Appretiativ&egrave;, i. e.</HI> so as to prize him in our Judgments above all things; to esteem him more valuable in himself, more beneficial to us than all things else we can enjoy, ac|cording to that saying of the <HI>Psalmist,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 63.3.</NOTE> <HI>Thy lo|ving kindness is much better than is Life it self</HI>; to esteem him as the only Felicity of our Immortal Souls; their chief and most desirable Good, the only Being in whom is
<PB N="56" REF="37">
perfect Rest, entire Complacency, and full Satisfaction to be found, and consequently to look on all things else as <HI>Loss</HI> and <HI>Dung</HI> com|pared to him. And whilst we retain this value for him, we can never prize or be con|cerned for any thing so much as for his Fa|vour, nor refuse to part with any thing which tendeth to deprive us of it, we can never value any other thing so much as to permit it to rival him who is exceedingly more pre|cious in our Eyes, and more desirable to our Souls, and so we cannot overvalue any world|ly thing. This therefore may be truly stiled the loving him with all our Mind.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That we are to love God above all things <HI>Comparativ&egrave;, i. e.</HI> with a superla|tive Affection, so as to be ready always to pre|fer his Favour before all other things. And this Affection, this cleaving of our hearts un|to him, must follow from the forementioned Estimation of him: For if we fully are con|vinced that there is infinitely more Excel|lency in God, more Happiness to be expect|ed from him, than all the Honours, Pleasures, Profits, Interests, Relations, and Satisfactions of the World can tender, and so the highest reason that he should always be prefered be|fore them; and that we should still cleave unto him, in opposition to any other thing: 'Tis certain he can have no rival in our hearts, nothing that stands in competition for our love, nothing we do not truely hate, and de|spise comparatively to his Favour; nothing that can tempt us to depart from from him, or to do the thing which will hazard his Fa|vour, or provoke his Displeasure; and may
<PB N="57" REF="37">
we not then be faid to love him with an entire and undivided heart?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That we are to love God above all things <HI>Intensive,</HI> that is, our desires must be more ardently enclined towards his Favour, and the Enjoyment of him; we must long, thirst, and pant more after him, rejoice more in his Favour than in any other thing, be more concerned to retain it than to secure any worldly Blessing, and be more satisfied in it than in Marrow and Fatness; and what more can the love of God with all our Souls import? For seeing such a prevalence of our Desires towards him, and Delight in him, will not permit us to desire any thing in opposition to him, or against his Will and Pleasure; but will constrain us to quit all other Interests, that we may happily retain our Interest in him, we thus desire and de|light in above all other things: It follows, that by thus loving God with all our Souls, our love unto, or our desire of the Creature, can never be inordinate or irregular, and so can never be offensive to God, and then it cannot be forbidden by the Command, <HI>To love the Lord our God with all our Souls?</HI></P>
<P>In these things seems to be implied, or from them certainly will follow that endea|vour above all things to please him; that in|dustrious care to serve and to obey him; that vigorous Imployment of all our other Facul|culties in his Service, which will demonstrate, that we comparatively do not labour <HI>for the Meat that perisheth,</HI> do not permit our Secu|lar Imployments, or our pursuit of any tem|poral Enjoyments to impair our diligence in
<PB N="58" REF="38">
the securing our eternal Interests; and there|fore that in the true import of the Phrase, we love God with all our might, all other Senses of it being inconsistent with that Dili|gence in our Callings, and that Industry in our Civil Affairs which God himself requires from us. And,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Hence it follows, that we are to love all other things only in way of Relation and Subordination to God; for if we do co-ordinately love any other thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cum autem ait toto corde, tota anima, tota mente nullam vitae nostrae partem Reliquit quae vacare de|beat, &amp; quasi locum dare ut ali&acirc; revelit frui, sed quicquid aliud diligendum venerit in animum illuc rapiatur quo totius dilecti|onis impetus currit.</HI> Aug. de Doctr. Christian. l. 1. cap. 22.</NOTE> we love it equally with God. And certainly if God requires us to love him with all our Hearts, and all our Souls, our love to other things must virtual|ly be comprised in our love to God, or be independant on it, or subservient to it, or else we must deprive him of some portion of the Heart he wholly calls for. Moreover God being our ultimate and chiefest Good, all other things can only be Good, as they conduce to the Enjoyment or Service of him, and so are to be loved by him; that is, we must love them as they relate to him, as they enable us to serve him, as they are, or may be Instrumental to his Glory, or to our Enjoyment of him. When therefore we desire the Creature only for God's sake, <HI>viz.</HI> that we may have Food and Rayment to sustain that Life we have devoted to his Ser|vice. Encrease of temporal Enjoyments, that we may be more able to feed Christ's hun|gry, and clothe his naked Members, or more engaged to serve him <HI>with Ioy and Gladness
<PB N="59" REF="38">
of Heart for the abundance of all things,</HI> when we desire Marriage, or a Wife, that we may not <HI>burn</HI>; and Children, that, as <HI>Plato</HI> saith, we may breed them up in the Fear and Nur|ture of the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. De Leg. l. 6. p. 869. F.</NOTE> <HI>and leave behind us a Race of pious Persons, who may do him service, when we are dead and gone</HI>; and Honour, that we may be more instrumental to promote his Glory, and to do Good to others; and lastly, the Knowledge of the Creature, that we may learn to Glorifie the Creator, by viewing the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness he hath dis|covered in the Creation of them; who sees not that this love of the Creature centers in the love of God, and tends expresly to his Glory, and therefore cannot be forbidden by this Command to love the Lord with all our Hearts, and all our Souls?</P>
<P>And of this Exposition of these Words we cannot reasonably doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 2.</NOTE> if we consider that our Lord himself doth plainly seem to favour and approve of it, making that Service, and so that Love which he requires from us, to consist in that prevalence of Affection which enables us, in any competition betwixt the love of the World, and the love of Him, to cleave to God, and despise the World. This evidently is the import of these words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 6.24.</NOTE> <HI>No Man can serve two Masters</HI> (when their Services and Commands do interfere) <HI>for he will either hate the one, and love the other, he will cleave to the one, and despise the other; ye cannot</HI> (there|fore) <HI>serve God and Mammon.</HI> Mr. <HI>N.</HI> indeed saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 64, 65.</NOTE>
<Q>Here we are plainly told we cannot divide between God and the Creature, be|cause
<PB N="60" REF="39">
we cannot love either of them but upon such a Principle as must utterly ex|clude the love of the other.</Q>
But, 1<HI>st.</HI> the word <HI>Mammon</HI> doth not signifie the Creature in general, but Riches and Money in parti|cular: Now will it follow, that because I must not love Money, that I may not love my Victuals, or that because I may not de|sire Riches, which <HI>Agur</HI> prayed against, I may not desire Food convenient for me, which he prayed for? 2<HI>dly,</HI> When our Lord saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 6.24.</NOTE> <HI>No Man can serve two Masters,</HI> can this be so interpreted, as to infer we cannot serve our Master Christ, and be Servants to our <HI>Masters according to the Flesh in all things</HI> not forbidden by him? Must I needs hate my Master, if I love my Saviour; or despise him, if I cleave to my Lord Christ? Must not then the words be necessarily Interpreted of Masters Co-ordinate, or Masters whose Com|mands and Services do interfere? 3<HI>dly,</HI> What is the Business of a Servant, is it not to obey the Pleasure of his Lord, and yield himself up entirely in Subjection to his Commands? What therefore must it be here to serve God, but to give up our selves entirely to his Ser|vice, and the Obedience of his Will? What to serve Mammon, but to give up our selves to the pursuit of Riches, and to obey the De|sires and Cravings of our covetous and world|ly Appetites? Thus it is certain, that we can|not divide betwixt God and the Creature, or love the one but from a Principle which excludes the love of the other; but a Subor|dinate Affection to the Creature is no more exclusive of our love to God, then is the Ser|vice
<PB N="61" REF="39">
of an Earthly Master exclusive of the Service which we owe to Christ our Ma|ster.</P>
<P>Again, Christ places the due love of him|self in the prevalence of our Affections to him above other things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10.37.</NOTE> saying, <HI>He that loveth Father and Mother, Son or Daughter, <GAP DESC="foreign">, above me, is not worthy of me</HI>; whence it must follow by the Rule of contraries, that he who loveth Christ more than Father and Mother, Son or Daughter, or any worldly Interest whatever, must be worthy of him. From these two places it is therefore evident, that to love God so as to despise and to forsake all other things, to cleave unto him; to love God superlatively, so as to have our Affecti|ons more powerfully carried out after him, than any other thing that is most dear unto us, is, in the Scripture Sense, to love God with a whole and an entire Heart. And surely, if I love God, so as to love nothing which is contrary to him, or which he forbiddeth me to love, I can do nothing contrary to the love I owe unto him. If I love him, so as to prize neither Friendship, Relations, Fame, Honour, Pleasures, Riches, Life, or any tem|poral Concernments, so as to offend him by preserving them, I do not inordinately love them; for Obedience being the true test of Love; where there is no neglect of Obeeience, there can be no want of love. Moreover, if I prize nothing in comparison with God in my mind, if I cleave to nothing in competition with him in my will, if I de|sire nothing in comparison with him in my Affections, if I pursue nothing but with re|lation
<PB N="62" REF="40">
to his Glory, and in Subordination to his Sacred Will, how can I be wanting in my Duty to him? And if I be not wanting in my Duty to him, how can I sin against him?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 3.</NOTE>That by this Exposition this precept is ex|tended beyond the real import of it, even beyond what any Person, in this State of Im|perfection, doth, or can do, is very plausibly asserted by all the <HI>Romish Commentators</HI> I have read, and by the most judicious of the Re|formed, who affirm, it only doth require sin|cere Obedience, and to aim at, and endea|vour to advance to that Intension and Super|lative Affection which we cannot expect compleatly to attain to in this Life.</P>
<P>But that any Person should not be satisfied with all this, but still be stretching of this Duty to a higher pitch, charging the Au|thors of this Exposition with <HI>Insincerity,</HI> and love unto their <HI>Lusts,</HI> and the Exposition it self with the most odious Consequences, this is just matter of our Admiration. And yet this is so plainly, and so confidently done by Mr. <HI>N.</HI> that in defence of their own Repu|tations, and of the Reputation of their tra|duced Brethren, all the whole Body of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who differ from him in these Senti|ments, stand bound to vindicate themselves from those vile Imputations which he casts upon them. For,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> As to the first Part of the common Exposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 7.</NOTE> That <HI>God must be loved with a Su|perlative Affection,</HI> he Affirms that,
<Q>Sure the Authors of it could not but be sensible that
<PB N="63" REF="40">
herein they did not rise up to the Letter of the Text, which manifestly requires a more elevated Sense;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 12.</NOTE> namely that our whole Affections be placed upon God, and that we love him so entirely, as to love none but him. That we ought to love God, not only with the best and most, but with the whole of our Affection;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 11.</NOTE> that we love him entirely, not only with Integrity of Parts, but with Integrity of Degrees; that we love him, not only with every Capacity, Passion and Faculty, with the Understand|ing suppose, Will and Affections, but in every degree of every Power, with all the latitude of our Will, and with the whole possibility of our Souls; that we bestow on him not only the highest degree of it, but every degree of it, the whole. In one word, that God be not only the Principal, but the Only Object of our Love. No less can he be supposed to require from us by Virtue of this Great Law, when he bids us to <HI>love him with all our Heart, with all our Soul, and with all our Mind.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to the second Branch of the ordinary Exposition, <HI>That we are to love other things beside God, only in a way of relation, and "subordination to God</HI>; He is pleased to speak somewhat contemptibly of the Authors of it, as if he pitied their Ignorance. His words are these.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 75.</NOTE>
<Q>So it is said by some who think they strain the love of God to a very high pitch, when they tell us we must love no|thing but God, or in order and relation to God. So then, according to these Men, we are allow'd to love Creatures, provided
<PB N="64" REF="41">
it be in a Relation and Subordination to God, who, upon this Principle, is not to be the only, but only the final and ultimate Object of our Love. But methinks these Mens relative Love is very much like the relative Worship of the <HI>Papists,</HI> they make God the only ultimate Object of Divine Worship, and so do these Men make him the only last Object of divine Love, but yet they allow of giving divine Worship to a Creature, provided it be in a transi|tive and relative way. And so these Men allow of bestowing our love upon a Crea|ture, provided it be for God's sake, or in relation to God, provided it do not stop at the Creature, but run on till at last it fix upon God as its final Object.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 217.</NOTE>In his Tenth Letter he speaks thus;
<Q>The Truth and Reasonableness of this Notion, (<HI>viz.</HI> That God only is to be the Object of our Love,) seems to me so very evident, that as I cannot with-hold my assent from it my self, so, were it not a matter of Pra|ctice wherein our Passions and Interests are concerned, as well as Theory that imploys our Understandings, I should strangely wonder at all Rational and considerate Persons that can. But this, in great mea|sure, silences my admiration: For this is the great disadvantage that all Truths of a moral Nature lie under, in comparison of those that are Physical or Mathematical, that though the former be in themselves no less certain than the latter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 218.</NOTE> and demonstra|ted with equal evidence, yet they will not equally convince, nor find a parallel re|ception
<PB N="65" REF="41">
in the minds of Men, because they meet with their Passions and Lusts, and have often the Will and Affections to con|tend with, even after they have gained upon their Understandings.&mdash; Were I to deal only with the Rational Part of Man, I should think the half of what has been said enough to convince that; but considering the nature of the Truth I ad|vance, and what a strong Interest is made against it in the Affectionate Part of Human Nature, I cannot expect to find the Gene|ral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of Men over forward to receive it. &mdash;The other Precepts of Morality cross only some particular Interests of Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 221.</NOTE> and fight only against some of his strag|glings Passion; but this engages the whole Body of Concupiscence, and at once en|counters the whole Interest of Prejudice, all the Force that is or can be raised in Hu|mane Nature; which when I consider I cannot hope by the clearest and strongest Reasoning to reconcile the Generality of the World to a Notion so opposite to the Passions, Customs, and Prejudices of it; only there may be here and there <HI>some li|beral and ingenious Spirits,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 221.2 <HI>d.</HI></NOTE> <HI>who have in great measure purged themselves from the Prejudices of Sense, disingaged their Hearts from the love of sensible Objects, and so far entred into the methods of true Mortification, as to be capable of Conviction, and of having their minds wrought upon by the light and force of Reason.</HI></Q>
And lastly he adds,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 242, 243.</NOTE>
<Q>That Men are back|ward not only to pay that entire Love which they owe to God, but even to ac|knowledge
<PB N="66" REF="42">
the Debt, and are not only loath to obey the Command, but even to understand it, will use a thousand Arts and Devices to shift off and evade the genuine force of it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 6.</NOTE> and, rather than fail, will say, That though God in the most plain and express terms calls for whole Love, yet he means but a part of it. Strange and ama|zing Partiality and Presumption! But of this general Backwardness to receive the Sense of this plain Command (as plain as, <HI>Thou shalt have no other Gods but me.</HI>) I have already hinted an account in the for|mer part of this Letter.</Q>
I shall not return that Answer to these reflecting Words which they deserve, but shall content my self,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>First,</HI> To offer to Mr. <HI>N.</HI> some General Considerations which may be proper to move him, upon second thoughts, to abate him somewhat of his Confidence, and be more moderate in his Censures of his Fathers and Brethren, if not out of respect to them, yet out of regard to his own dear Self, who in his other Writings hath plainly and expresly taught that very Doctrine, and Exposition which he now Condemns.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> I shall further establish the com|mon Exposition, and confirm it by the clear|est Evidence of Scripture and of Reason. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Shall endeavour to return an An|swer to his pretended Demonstrations, for his new elevated Sense of this Command. And,</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="42"><HI>First,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 4.</NOTE> Whereas he saith, <HI>The common Inter|preters sure could not but be sensible that herein they did not rise up to the Letter of the Text, which manifestly requires a more elevated Sense.</HI> Let me instruct him to consider whether Christian Charity will permit him thus pe|remptorily to pronounce that before him; and Mr. <HI>Malbranch,</HI> and all <HI>Commentators</HI> gave such a Sense of this great Commandment, of which they could not but be sensible that it fell short of all Mens Duty, or of what God required them to do, <HI>that they might live</HI>; and that they thus deviated from the Sense which the Text <HI>manifestly required</HI>; that is, that the Interpretation they delivered, as the true import of the Text, was contrary to the manifest Sense of it, and to the inward Sen|timents of their own Consciences.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 7.</NOTE> Whereas he adds, That <HI>they could not advance higher without building in the Air, and were therefore forced to cramp the Sense of this great Commandment, and to put such a Con|struction upon it not as the express words of it re|quire, but as their Hypothesis would bear.</HI> And that <HI>only he and Mr.</HI> Malbranch,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 22.</NOTE> <HI>have thought otherwise, or any further.</HI> Let me entreat him to consider whether it be reasonable to con|ceive that God left all Men ignorant of the true Grounds of this Command, till he and Mr. <HI>M.</HI> appeared to instruct the World in the true meaning of it; that though all Men were obliged by the light of Nature, all Jews and Christians by the light of Scripture, <HI>to love God with all their Hearts and Souls,</HI> yet they had no just Ground or Reason so to do, till
<PB N="68" REF="43">
he and Mr. <HI>M.</HI> bless'd the World with this new Invention, that our Lord hath given us another reason of this Precept is evident from these words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 6.4.</NOTE> <HI>Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 12.29, 30.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</HI> &amp;c. And I hope he will not dare to say that he <HI>built Castles in the Air,</HI> for want of his Philoso|phy, or gave us only such a reason as forced us to cramp the Sense of this Command|ment.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Let me entreat him to consider the plain Consequences of this his singular Opinion and Interpretation of these words, <HI>viz.</HI> That all <HI>Interpreters</HI> before him have taught all Men <HI>to love God less than he requi|red of them by virtue of this great Law,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 11, 15.</NOTE> to do God <HI>great Injury and Injustice,</HI> to <HI>defraud the Creator of what was due to him, to cross the Order of Nature, and resist the Will of its Great Au|thor</HI>; to be <HI>Idolaters,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 37.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> to worship the Sun, and to give every Creature a share in our Re|ligious Acknowledgments; to commit <HI>Spiri|tual Fornication and Adultery</HI>; to <HI>Deifie</HI> and <HI>Ido|lize</HI> the Creature; to do what is as much <HI>Idolatry,</HI> as is that <HI>Relati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e Worship</HI> which the <HI>Papists</HI> do ascribe to <HI>Images.</HI> Now can he in|deed believe all Christians and Jews of for|mer Ages were, and that all at present, be|sides Mr. <HI>Malbranch,</HI> and those few who em|brace his Sentiments, are Guilty of these horrid Crimes? If not, he must be so Un|charitable, as to think they do not act ac|cording to their Principles, or must confess that these things do not follow from them.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="43"><HI>Fourthly,</HI> When he saith his Exposition is <HI>so very evident,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 10. <HI>p.</HI> 217.</NOTE> <HI>that it is matter of just Admira|tion, that any Rational and Considerate Person can with-hold his assent from it</HI>; and that the reason why we do not see, or seeing will not own it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 221.</NOTE> is because it thwarts our <HI>Passions, Interests</HI> and <HI>Lusts, Customs</HI> and <HI>Prejudices:</HI> Because we have <HI>not purged our selves from the Prejudices of Sense,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 222.</NOTE> <HI>disingaged our Hearts from the love of sensible Objects, nor entred so far into the Methods of true Mortification, as to be capable of Conviction:</HI> That they who allow not of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 243.</NOTE> are Guilty of <HI>strange</HI> and <HI>a|mazing Partiality and Presumption, unwilling not only to obey the Command, but to understand it,</HI> and rather willing to <HI>shew a thousand Arts and Devices <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o shift off, and evade the genuine force of it.</HI> I say, when he useth such Ex|pressions, let me entreat him to consider whether it doth become him thus to be|spatter all his Adversaries, and tell them to their faces, if they will not yield assent to his odd Notion, they must have Lusts and Passions, which obstruct the Evidence of Truth; to cause all his <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Bre|thren</HI> who comply not&punc; with his Senti|ments, which scarce any of them do, as Guilty of <HI>strange and amazing Partiality,</HI> as Men not <HI>purged from the Prejudices of Sense,</HI> not <HI>disingaged from the love of sensible Objects,</HI> not <HI>entred so far into the Methods of true Mortifica|tion, as to be capable of Conviction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 5.</NOTE> Because it may be some Induce|ment to him, to shew more moderation in his Censures of those that differ from him in this
<PB N="70" REF="44">
Matter, to consider that the Great Mr. <HI>Nor|ris</HI> was formerly of the same Opinion with them, and that they differ no more from him, than he now differs from his former self, I shall proceed to shew that in his for|mer Treatises he hath conspired with us in this matter. For,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> In his <HI>Idea of Happiness,</HI> discoursing of the Degrees of the love of God, he saith,
<Q>The Computation of <HI>Bellarmine</HI> is accurate e|nough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. <HI>426.</HI></NOTE> who reckons Four. The first, is to love God proportionably to his loveliness, <HI>i. e.</HI> with an infinite Love, and this Degree is peculiar to God himself; The second, is to love him not proportionably to his Loveliness, but to the ut|most Capacity of a Creature, and this Degree is peculiar to Saints and Angels in Heaven. The third, is to love him not to the outmost Capacity of a Creature absolutely considered, but to the outmost Capacity of a mortal Crea|ture in this Life; and this, he says, is proper to the Religious. The fourth, is to love him not proportionably to the outmost Capacity of a Creature, but <HI>only so as to love nothing equally with, or above him, that is not to do any thing contrary to the Divine Love;</HI> and this, <HI>saith Mr.</HI> N. is an absolute indispensable Duty, less than which will not qualifie us for the Enjoyment of God hereafter.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 83, 84.</NOTE>In his Treatise of <HI>the Theory and Regula|tion of Love,</HI> he saith,
<Q>That <HI>as we are ob|liged to love God, so ought we to love him</HI> beyond all other things whatsoever. &mdash;<HI>We may, and must</HI> Prefer <HI>him in our Love,</HI> Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul, with all thy
<PB N="71" REF="44">
Mind, and with all thy Strength. <HI>So runs the Commandment, and very just we should; for if, even in particular Goods, Order requires that the most lovely should be loved most:</HI> N. B. <HI>much more ought we to love him who is the very Essence of Good, Good it self, be|yond all Derivative and secondary Good.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In his Treatise of <HI>Heroick Piety,</HI> he hath these words;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 282.</NOTE>
<Q>I know it is usually Objected, That what is supposed to be thus Heroickly per|formed, is inclusively enjoined by virtue of those comprehensive Words, <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord with all thy Heart.</HI></Q>
To which Ob|jection he Answers thus:
<Q>I conceive that All which is intended by that Phrase amounts to <HI>no more</HI> than, <HI>(1st.)</HI> a sincere love of God, as 'tis opposed to that which is partial and divi|ded; and, <HI>(2dly,)</HI> such a degree of loving as admits of nothing in competition with him: And thus far reaches the bounds of indispen|sable Duty, it being impossible that he who does not love God in this Sense and Degree, should keep his Commandments.</Q></P>
<P>Now here I would crave leave to ask him whether, when he wrote these things, <HI>He could not but be sensible that he did not rise up to the Letter of the Text,</HI> and that <HI>it manifestly re|quired a more elevat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d Sense</HI>; though, to pre|serve his Heroick Piety, he pretended to con|ceive, it <HI>amounted to no more than loving God sincerely in opposition to a par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">d divided love, and so as to admit of nothing into competition with him?</HI> Whether by these Savings he taught Men <HI>to love God less th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ired, to defraud him of his due, to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">sist his W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ll?</HI> &amp;c. Whether he only said these things, as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ing
<PB N="72" REF="45">
then under the Power of his <HI>Passions, Lusts, Interests, Customs</HI> and <HI>Prejudices,</HI> and not <HI>be|ing in due measure purged from the Prejudices of Sense, not disingaged from the love of sensible Ob|jects, not so far entered into the methods of true Mortification, as to be capable of Conviction; and of having his mind wrought upon by the light and force of Reason?</HI> If not, let him learn here|after, from his own Sense and Experience, not to pass such severe and undue Censures on his Brethren. Having premised these things, I proceed,</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> To establish and confirm the common Exposition from the Evidence of Scripture, and of Reason. Let it be then observed,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That this Command was given to the <HI>Iewish Nation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 6.</NOTE> and is only cited by our <HI>Lord,</HI> or by the <HI>Lawyer,</HI> from <HI>Deut.</HI> 6.5. where the words runs thus, <HI>Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord, and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy mind, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</HI> Now hence ariseth a demonstration, that this Text cannot be ex|pounded so as to exclude all love, or all de|sire of the Creature. For the Land they lived in was the Land of Promise, stiled by God himself, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>The pleasant Land,</HI> or, <HI>The Land of Desire,</HI> Psal. 106.24. Dan. 8.9. <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>The Land of Glory,</HI> or the Glorious Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 20.6. Dan. 11.16</NOTE> as being the Glory, the most pleasant, and desirable of all Lands; to encourage them to go in and possess it, it is represented to them as <HI>an exceeding good Land, a Land which floweth with Milk and Honey;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 8.7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>a good Land,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 8.7, 8, 9.</NOTE> <HI>a Land of Wheat, and Barley, and Vines,
<PB N="73" REF="45">
and Figtrees, and Pomegranates; a Land of Oil-Olive and Honey; a Land wherein they should eat Bread without scarceness, and in which they should not lack any thing;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 11.12.</NOTE> <HI>a Land which the Lord thy God careth for; the eyes of the Lord thy God are upon it, from the beginning of the year, even to the end of the year.</HI> And might they not de|sire what was the very promise made to the Seed of <HI>Abraham</HI>? Might they not love, or be pleased with a Land so glorious, so plea|sant, and desirable? Doubtless they would have marched but heavily through the Barren and Desolate Wilderness, had <HI>Moses</HI> by this Precept forbid them to desire, or be pleased with <HI>this Land flowing with Milk and Honey.</HI> Moreover, the Blessings of this Life were the chief things which God did promise to these <HI>Iews,</HI> as the Reward of their Affection and Obedience to him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 8.18.</NOTE> whence he is said <HI>to give them Wealth, that he might stablish his Cove|nant with them, to make them plenteous in the Works of their hands for Good:</HI> And the taking away of those outward Blessings was the chief thing threatned in the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> to de|ter them their Disobedience; For, saith God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 11.13, 14, 15.</NOTE> <HI>if you will hearken diligently to my Com|mandments, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul, then will I give you the Rain of thy Land in due season, that thou mayst gather thy Corn, and thy Wine, and thy Oil: And I will send Grass in thy Field for thy Cattle, that thou may|est eat and be full.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. 23.25, 26.</NOTE> <HI>Ye shall serve the Lord thy God, and he shall bless thy Bread, and thy Wa|ter; and I will take Sickness from thee, and ful|fil the number of thy days.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Levit. 15.18, 19.</NOTE> <HI>Ye shall do my Sta|tutes,

<PB N="75" REF="46">
in <HI>every good thing he hath given them.</HI> More|over, upon their Disobedience, he threatneth the removal of all these Blessings, and to strip them of all these good things; that he would <HI>shut up the Heavens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 11.16, 17.</NOTE> that <HI>there be no Rain,</HI> that <HI>the Land yield not her Fruit,</HI> and that <HI>they should perish quickly from the good Land that God had given them</HI>; that <HI>they should be cursed in their Basket and Store, in the Fruit of their Body, of their Land, of their Kine, and Sheep</HI>; that he <HI>would send upon them Cursing, Vexation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 28.17, 18, 20, 48.</NOTE> <HI>and Re|buke in all they put their hand unto</HI>; and that <HI>they should serve their Enemies in Hunger, and in Thirst, and in Nakedness, and in want of all things.</HI> Now if God, by requiring them <HI>to love the Lord with all their Hearts and Souls,</HI> had enjoined them not to desire, or affect any of these outward things, to what purpose doth he promise what he forbids them to de|sire? Or what Encouragement can such Promises afford them thus to love him? If these things were in no sense <HI>their good,</HI> why are they stiled <HI>God's Blessings</HI> and his <HI>Gifts?</HI> And why are they commanded to <HI>rejoice in them,</HI> and so bless him for them? Yea, why are they said to be blessed in them? But if they were their good things, why might they not desire or effect them proportionably to the Goodness that was in them? Yea lastly, if they were not good and desirable things, wherein consists the hurt and Curse in being stripped and deprived of them? 'Tis therefore manifest that this Interpreta|tion, as it casts a slur and a reproach on all God's temporal Blessings, as having in them nothing good, nothing fit to be desired, or
<PB N="76" REF="47">
worthy to be loved, and therefore tends to rob him of the Praises due unto him for them, so doth it also impair the force of all the Pro|mises by which God did endeavour to en|gage his People thus to love him, and of those threats by which he did deter them from their Disobedience; this therefore can|not be the genuine import of these words.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argum.</HI> 2. &sect;. 7.</NOTE>Again, from this Consideration, That this Command was given to the <HI>Iewish Nation,</HI> it follows that it ought to bear the Sense which is the certain import of it in all those other places of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> where it only doth occur, it being only found in the <HI>New Testament</HI> as a Citation thence. 'Tis therefore certain, that it doth not require us to love God in perfection of degrees, or in the elevated Sense contended for, but only to love him with a sincere and a prevailing love. For,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> God's Servants entred into a Cove|nant to serve the Lord after this manner. Thus <HI>Asa gathered all Benjamin and Iudah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 15.12.</NOTE> <HI>and they entred into Covenant to seek the Lord God with all their Heart, and with all their Soul.</HI> And good <HI>Iosiah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kings 23.3.</NOTE> with all his People, <HI>made a Covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord, and to keep his Commandments with all their Heart, and with all their Soul:</HI> Now if, in this Covenant, they promised <HI>to love God with every degree of every Power, with the whole pos|sibility of the Soul; to bestow on him not only the highest Degree of it, but every Degree of it, the whole</HI>; and to <HI>make him not only the Principal,</HI> but <HI>the only Object of their love,</HI> they promised
<PB N="77" REF="47">
what they knew they never could, what to be sure they never did perform. And why then is it said, That <HI>the People stood to the Co|venant, and that God wus found of them.</HI> But if they only promised love of Sincerity, and love to God above all other things, and that they would adhere to him and his Service, then may this Phrase Import no more.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> This God required them to do, to render them the Objects of his Grace and Favour, promising to have Mercy on them in their Captivity on this Condition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 4.29.</NOTE> <HI>If from thence,</HI> saith <HI>Moses, thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him; if thou seek him with all thy Heart, and all thy Soul.</HI> And again, <HI>if thou shalt return to the Lord thy God with all thy Heart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 3.2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>and with all thy Soul, then the Lord thy God will turn thy Captivity, and have Compas|sion on thee, and will bring thee into the Land which thy Fathers possessed; and thou shalt possess it, and he will do thee Good.</HI> And upon this Condition only doth <HI>Solomon</HI> desire this Mer|cy, saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Kings 8.48.</NOTE> <HI>If they turn to thee with all their Heart and all their Soul in the Land of their Ene|mies, then hear thou their Prayer and their Suppli|cation.</HI> Now is it reasonable to conceive that God required such an absolute Perfection of Degrees in their Affection and Obedience, to qualifie them for his Favour under their Captivity? If so, they must for ever have continued Captives. Would he promise to restore them to their good Land, and to do them Good upon a Condition that would not permit them either to desire that plea|sant Land, or any other Temporal Enjoy|ment as their Good? Sure the Suspension of
<PB N="78" REF="48">
his Favour upon this Condition, is a clear Evidence, that this Phrase bears a milder Sense.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> God doth acknowledge that some of them did actually love him thus, That King <HI>David had kept his Commandments,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Kings 14.8.</NOTE> <HI>and followed him with all his heart, saving in the matter of Uriah</HI>; and yet we find him Guil|ty of Mistrust of God's own Promise, by say|ing, <HI>I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 27.1. <HI>ch.</HI> 21.2. <HI>ch.</HI> 25.22.</NOTE> of Lying to <HI>Abimelech,</HI> of a rash Oath, in Swearing to <HI>cut off the House of Nabal</HI>; of In|justice, in giving a deceitful <HI>Ziba</HI> half the Goods of <HI>Mephibosheth</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 19.29. <HI>ch.</HI> 24.1. 2 Kings 23.24, 25.</NOTE> and of Pride, in <HI>num|bering the People.</HI> God also testifies of good <HI>Iosiah,</HI> That <HI>he turned to the Lord with all his Soul, and all his Heart, and all his Might,</HI> since therefore God himself declares of Men thus subject to Imperfection that they did thus love him, that love cannot require a Perfecti|on of Degrees, but only a sincere and preva|lent Affection to him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 8.</NOTE>In a word, in the Language of the <HI>Old Te|stament,</HI> to <HI>serve God with the whole heart and Soul</HI>; to <HI>walk before him with a perfect heart, and with Integrity of heart,</HI> hath an essential respect to the owning him alone to be the true God, in opposition to all strange Gods, and the continuing stedfast in his Service, in opposition to the Service of the <HI>Heathen Idols,</HI> or the <HI>Calves</HI> of <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethel</HI>; Thus when God permitted a False <HI>Prophet</HI> to arise a|mong them, and to <HI>shew a Sign,</HI> or <HI>do a Wonder</HI> to tempt them to desert him, and <HI>go after other Gods,</HI> he declares he did this for

tryal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 13.3.</NOTE> <HI>Whether they loved the Lord their God with all their Hearts, and all their Souls,</HI> and therefore it must be sufficient to shew they did so, that they were not prevailed upon by that false <HI>Prophet</HI> to decline from following after God, but still cleaved stedfastly to him.

with this Restriction, <HI>if it be thy pleasure</HI>; and are still ready to par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t with it, when he who gave it is pleased to recal it, and to say when he hath done so, <HI>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord.</HI> For what more naturally tends to produce in us that <GAP DESC="foreign">, that Quietness, that Smooth|ness, and Tranquillity of Spirit in all Con|ditions and Events, in which <HI>Philosophers</HI> have plac'd the Happiness of Man?

<P><Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 233.</NOTE>How happy therefore is the Man who can thus Order and Regulate the Master and leading Passion of his Nature.

[That he loves nothing else but for his sake, nothing but as 'tis instrumental to his Glory, nothing but with entire submission to his all-wise Pleasure.]
<Q>That can force the Creatures to withdraw, command their absence, and wholly empty
<PB N="89" REF="53">
his heart of their love.</Q>
[Yea can hate and despise them whenever they prove Tempta|tions to, or Hinderances of his Love to, or his Enjoyment of God.]
<Q>How ravishing and lasting are his Delights? How solid and profound is his Peace? How full and overflowing are his Joys? How bright and lucid are the Regions of his Soul? How en|tire and undisturbed are his Enjoyments? What a settled Calm possesses his Breast? What a firm stable Rest does his Soul find when she thus reposes her full weight upon God? How loose and disentangled is he from the World; and how unconcerned doth he pass along through the various Scenes and Revolutions of it; how un|moved and unaltered in all the several Changes and Chances of this present Life?</Q></P>
<P>Why therefore doth Mr. <HI>N.</HI> tell us, That <HI>the Man that harbours Creatures in his Bosom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 10. <HI>p.</HI> 240, 241.</NOTE> <HI>and divides his Heart betwixt God and them, will be always in great danger of being betrayed by them; and though he should with great Care, and habitual Watchfulness preserve for God a greater share in his Affections (which is the most such a one can pretend to) yet he will have such a weight constantly hanging upon his Soul, that he will be never able to sore very high, or arrive at any Ex|cellency in Religion?</HI> Can our Love of what God promises; our Esteem for his Blessings; our Desire of what he commands us to pray for that we may, and to give thanks for when we have received, be obstructive to our ad|vancement in Religion? Can that Heart be said to be divided betwixt God and the Crea|tures, which never suffers the Creature to
<PB N="90" REF="54">
come in competition with him, never loves it in opposition to him? Can that Soul have any weight upon it obstructing its ascent to God, which always infinitely prefers him in her Affections before all other things; and is still ready to quit them for his sake?</P>
<P>In fine, it may deserve to be considered, that we cannot safely argue that a thing is, may, or should be so, because it would be an advantage to Religion were it so: For what an advantage would it be to Truth, to have a <HI>living Infallible Iudge</HI> of it; or that every <HI>Parson</HI> of a <HI>Parish,</HI> or every <HI>Private Person</HI> were Infallible? But must we therefore grant to the <HI>Papist</HI> such a <HI>living Iudge,</HI> or to the <HI>Quaker</HI> such an <HI>Infallible Spirit?</HI> What fine Harangues might Mr. <HI>N.</HI> and the Good Lady make of the Advantages to Religion, which might arise from living without sleep, or weariness, or without the <HI>Body which presseth down the Soul,</HI> and yet all their fine <HI>Rhetorick</HI> would be lost, because this sutes not with that Nature God hath given us; if then he hath given us a Nature subject to the same Necessities of other things, as well as Sleep and Faculties, which cannot but desire them; so that we may expect as well to live without the Body, as without them: They must also spend their <HI>Rhetorick</HI> in vain, when they endeavour to perswade us to <HI>banish all desire of the Creature from us.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The Contents.</HEAD>
<P> This Chapter contains an Answer to Mr. <HI>N.'s</HI> Arguments from Scripture, for a love of God exclusive of all love of Desire of the Creature; as, <HI>V. G. 1st.</HI> From these Words, <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Matth. 22.37. &sect;. 1. 2dly.</HI> From those Words of St. <HI>James, Ye Adulterers and Adul|teresses, know ye not that the Friend|ship of this World is enmity to God, James 4.4. &sect;. 2. 3dly.</HI> From these Words of St. <HI>John, Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World, 1 John 2.15. &sect;. 3.</HI> And to his Arguments against the relative Love of the Creature, <HI>V. G. 1.</HI> That it is as much Ido|latry as the relative Worship of the Crea|ture. This Answered, <HI>1. ad hominem,</HI> by shewing that it was formerly approved by Mr. <HI>N. 2.</HI> By shewing the Disparities betwixt the relative Love of the Creature, and the relative Worship of Images, &sect;. <HI>4. Object. 2.</HI> If Creatures be truly and pro|perly lovely, as being our true and proper Good, they are to be loved absolutely and for themselves; if not, they are not to be

loved at all. <HI>Answered,</HI> by shewing in what Sense they may be stiled our true and proper Good, and be loved for themselves, <HI>viz.</HI> as that imports a love of them only for that Goodness God hath put into them; and how they may not be loved absolutely, and for themselves, <HI>viz.</HI> as that excludes the Subordination of that Affection to the Love of God, &sect;. <HI>5.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 1.</NOTE>AGainst this sense of the Words I plead for, Mr. <HI>N.</HI> hath but one Objection from the words themselves, and it runs thus,
<Q>The Text saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 10.</NOTE> <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind,</HI> but does he love God at this Rate, who loves him only princi|pally, and more than any thing else? Does this exhaust the Sense of this great Com|mandment? Can he be said, with any to|lerable Sense, to love God with all his Heart and Soul, that only loves him above other things, at the same time allowing other things a share in his love? Can he be said to love God with all his Love, <HI>N. B.</HI> who loves him only with a part? What though that part be the larger part, 'tis but a part still, and is a part of the whole? What Logick, or what Grammar will en|dure this?</Q>
To this I answer,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI> 1.</NOTE><HI>First,</HI> That he assumes what never will be granted by Divines, <HI>viz.</HI> That Scripture Phrases must be Interpreted not according to the Analogy of Faith, and the import of the
<PB N="93" REF="55">
same words elsewhere occurring in the Holy Scripture, but according to the Rules of Lo|gick and of Grammar, which supposition would render the Interpretation of Scripture very absurd in many places. For instance,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Apostle saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2.21.</NOTE> <HI>All Men seek their own, and not the things of Iesus Christ</HI>; that is, say Interpreters, many, or most Men, do so. The <HI>Gospel</HI> was <HI>Preached to all the World,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 1.6, 23.</NOTE> <HI>to every Creature under Heaven,</HI> saith the same Apostle; and the <HI>Faith</HI> of the <HI>Romans</HI> was <HI>spoken of in all the World</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1.8.</NOTE> when as then many Parts even of the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> had heard no|thing of it. Here therefore all Interpreters allow a <HI>Synecdoche totius pro parte,</HI> i. e. <HI>the whole is put for the most celebrated Parts of the World</HI>; and will he here ask, Can that be said to be <HI>Preached to all,</HI> and <HI>spoken of in all the World,</HI> which is only Preached and spoken of in a part of it? Is a part the whole?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Again, <HI>Children obey your Parents in all things; Servants obey your Masters according to the Flesh in all things,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 3.20, 22.</NOTE> saith the Text. This Generality, say <HI>Interpreters,</HI> is to be restrain'd to <HI>all things honest,</HI> to <HI>all things belonging to their Right as Parents, or Masters to command</HI>; and will he here cry out, What Logick, or what Gram|mar will endure this?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In Precepts absolutely negative,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Negatio non est absoluta sed per com|parationem.</HI></NOTE> and even exclusive, that which in Words is ab|solutely denied, must be interpreted so as only to import, that 'tis denied not abso|lutely, but comparatively, not as to the whole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hos. 6.6.</NOTE> but as to the degree; as, <HI>V. G.</HI> God saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 9.13.</NOTE> <HI>I required Mercy, and not Sacrifice</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10.20.</NOTE> when as yet the greatest part of <HI>Leviticus</HI> is im|ploy'd
<PB N="64" REF="56">
in giving Laws concerning Sacrifices. Christ saith, <HI>Fear not them which can kill the Body;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 12.24. and Prov. 24.21.</NOTE> <HI>Samuel, Only fear the Lord, and serve him</HI>; and yet saith the Scripture, <HI>Fear the Lord, and the King,</HI> and <HI>Render to all their dues,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13.7.</NOTE> <HI>fear to whom fear</HI>; so that the import of these Words must be this, Fear not the one so much as the other; fear not Man or Idols so as to incur the displeasure of God.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI> 2.</NOTE><HI>Secondly,</HI> I ask <HI>what Grammar will not en|dure it?</HI> I have already shew'd, the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and the <HI>Greek</HI> of the Septuagint do use the Phrase in this Sense; as for the <HI>Latins</HI> no|thing is more common with them than to express an ardent Love, by saying, <HI>In amore est totus, unic&egrave; amat, toto pectore diligit, omni studio aliquem amplectitur:</HI> In French it is as common to say, <HI>Ie vous aime de tout mon coeur:</HI> We teach our very Children to say, <HI>I love my Dad, I love my Mam with my whole Heart</HI>; nothing therefore being more ordi|nary in every Language than to use this Ex|pression, when we do not in the least intend to signifie the Person we thus love, is loved exclusively of all others, but only that he is
<PB N="95" REF="56">
very much beloved by us: Why may not the Scripture say this of that God we are obliged to love above all things, and before all things, and so as to love other things on|ly in Subordination and Relation to him; loving none other with that Love which is due and proper to him? For as we are com|manded to <HI>serve him only,</HI> and yet may serve our King, our <HI>Master,</HI> and our <HI>Friend</HI>; to <HI>fear him only,</HI> and yet may fear our <HI>Parents,</HI> our <HI>Superiors</HI> and <HI>Masters,</HI> because we do not serve them with that Religious Worship, nor fear them with that Reverence which is due to God alone: So may we love the Creature with a love of Desire, and our Neighbour with a love of Benevolence, and yet love God only with that Desire and Benevolence which is due to him alone. When Mr. <HI>N.</HI> proposeth this Objection against his own O|pinion, That <HI>if the Love of God required our whole Affection, we could not love our Neigh|bour as our selves,</HI> he is forced to Answer thus, that
<Q><HI>If the Love of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 71.</NOTE> <HI>and of our Neighbour were of the same Kind, that entire Love of the former would indeed exclude the latter; but this is not the Case, we are not here supposed to love God in the same Sense, or with the same sort of love wherewith we love our Neighbour.</HI></Q>
So, say I, is it in our case, we do not love the Creature <HI>with the same sort of Love,</HI> or <HI>in the same Sense</HI> in which we love God, <HI>i. e.</HI> not with a Religious Affection, but with a Na|tural only; not as our Spiritual, but as our Temporal Good; not as the Good of our Immortal Souls, but our Frail Bodies; not as our End, our Rest, or our chief Good, not
<PB N="96" REF="57">
for its own, but for God's sake; whereas we love God with a religious Affection, as the Spiritual and Eternal Good of our Immortal Souls, as our End, Rest, and our chief Good, and even for himself:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duct.

<HI>Greek</HI> from whence these words are cited, ran thus, <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord, <GAP DESC="foreign">, from the whole Heart</HI>; now sure we may love one thing <HI>ex animo,</HI> from the whole Heart, and desire it entirely, and yet may also sometime imploy our desires upon other things?</P>
<P>The Second Objection from Scripture is taken from the words of the <HI>Apostles Iames</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 2. <HI>Object.</HI> 2.</NOTE> the words of the <HI>Apostle Iames</HI> are these,<NOTE PLACE="marg">James 4.4.</NOTE> <HI>Ye Adulterers and Adulteresses, know ye not that the Friendship of this World is en|mity to God?

<P>I Answer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE> That as a Woman becomes not an Adulteress by any Affection to, or Friend|ship with another Man, for she ought to love her Friend, and Neighbour, and Relations, and to shew Friendship to them, but only by loving Friend or Neighbour with the love proper to her Husband, with that love which comes in competition with,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Si autem amaveris h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">c quamvis Deus fecerit &amp; neglexeris creatorem, &amp; amaveris mundum nonne tuus Amor Adulterinus de|putabitur.</HI> August. in Ep.

<Q>Every lover of the Creature is in proportion an Idolater upon our former Principle; for by loving Crea|tures we suppose them our Goods, that they are able to act upon our Souls, and
<PB N="99" REF="58">
affect them with pleasing Sensations, that they perfect our Being, and are the causes of our Happiness, which is to suppose them to be so many Gods; so that <HI>there can be no such thing as loving the World with mode|ration,</HI> since we ought not to love it at all, for <HI>we Deifie the Object of our Love</HI>; and to affect the Creature in any degree, is so far to Idolize it.</Q>
To this I Answer,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI> 1.</NOTE> If <HI>there can be no such thing as loving, i. e.</HI> desiring <HI>the Creature with moderation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nunquid non est in his mo|dus?</HI> S. Au|gust.</NOTE> why doth the Scripture prescribe this Moderation as to the things of this World, by saying, <HI>Let your mo|deration,</HI> as to these things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 4.4.</NOTE> <HI>be known unto all, the Lord is at hand. Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by Prayer and Supplication with Thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God.</HI> Are not our Petitions of these things from God our desires of them? Is not our dependance on that Providence for them, which will give good Things to them that ask them, the Remedy here prescribed against our anxious Cares for these things? And must not then the Moderation here required Respect the same things?<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 7.29, 30.</NOTE> Again, <HI>Brethren,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>the time is short, it remaineth that both they that have Wives, be as if they had none; and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use this world, as not abusing it: For the Fashion of this world passeth away.</HI> Here do not all the Ancient Commentators agree that the Apostle prescribes mediocrity as to these transitory Things we can enjoy but for a short time? And that by commanding us to
<PB N="100" REF="59">
have and use them as <HI>if we did it not,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. Theoph. vide Theo|doret &amp; Oecum in locum.</NOTE> he only doth enjoin us <HI>not to have our hearts affixed, and our chief care imployed about them; and that to abuse the world is thus to use it to the Satis|faction of our Lusts, or so as to imploy all our Studies and Affections on it</HI>; doth not the <HI>Apostle</HI> himself thus explain our weeping for our lost Friends, <HI>viz.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thes. 4.13.</NOTE> That we should not do it immoderate|ly; and is not that sufficient warrant, so to interpret the other Particulars? And since these words respect the Moderation of our Joy and Grief, and we do joy and grieve ac|cording as we do affect the Objects of those Passions; why should they not be also deem|ed to respect the Moderation of our Affection to, or our desires of this World?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If <HI>we Deifie the Object that we love,</HI> we Deifie every Woman that we love in order to Matrimony; every Child and Rela|tion we desire to preserve, that so we may enjoy the Benefit and Comfort of their Pre|sence; we Deifie our selves when, accord|ing to the <HI>Psalmist, we desire life and love many days</HI>; yea, we Deifie all the Meat and Drink we love, and therefore do desire to eat and drink of; and if I love and desire a Cup of good Wine, because it <HI>maketh glad the Heart of Man,</HI> I am, <HI>ipso facto,</HI> an Idolater.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I deny that it is necessary that <HI>he who loves, i. e.</HI> desires <HI>any Creature</HI> (suppose Meat when he is hungry, or Drink when
<PB N="101" REF="59">
thirsty) <HI>must suppose that Creature perfects his Being, and is the cause of his Happiness; or that it is able to act upon his Soul, and affect it with pleasing Sensations:</HI> 'Tis only necessary that he should suppose those pleasing Sensations will follow upon the Enjoyment of those Crea|tures, and are not to be had without them; for put case a Sensual voluptuous Man were of your Opinion, would he ever the less pur|sure the delights of the Flesh, and of the sen|sual Appetites? Is it not the Pleasure annex|ed to the Enjoyment of these things which all the World pursue? And must they not then have the same reason to desire and pur|sue them, while the same Pleasures are an|nexed to the Enjoyment of them, whoever be the efficient cause of that Pleasure, or what|ever it be that acts upon the Soul, and affects it with these pleasing Sensations?</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> It cannot be Idolatry to suppose God acts upon my Soul by the virtue he hath put into a Creature, rather than immediately by himself; for then all the World must have been Idolaters before Mr. <HI>M.</HI> and Mr. <HI>N.</HI> made known this new Opinion to the World;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. P.</HI> 22.</NOTE> for he confesses that among the whole Tribe of <HI>Philosophers</HI> that went before them <HI>none of them thought any otherwise, or any farther,</HI> but universally held, that <HI>Bodies had a power of pro|ducing such Sensations:</HI> 'Tis also evident that Children for a long time taste the Pleasures of the Creatures before they can be able to dis|cern that God immediately produces these pleasing Sensations in them; and that the Generality of the World are still uncapable of knowing that he doth so. Now is not
<PB N="102" REF="60">
this to vilifie the Providence and Wisdom of God, and to reproach his Goodness to say, That he hath laid the World under a sad ne|cessity of <HI>defrauding God of his Worship,</HI> and <HI>committing</HI> that Sin of <HI>Idolatry,</HI> which <HI>he that doth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 6.9, 10.</NOTE> saith the Apostle, <HI>shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> Moreover all Idolatry im|plies an act of Religious Worship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5.20, 21.</NOTE> though mis|placed; now do we by desiring Meat when we are hungry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5.5.</NOTE> or Drink when thirsty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apoc. 22.15.</NOTE> or by thus loving Meat and Drink as things which may gratifie our hungry or our thirsty Appetites, by the virtue God himself hath im|planted in them, worship Bread and Drink? All religious Worship proceeds from a direct immediate Intention, either to give Honour to that which we conceive to be God, or else ascribes to the Object worshipped some of the Divine Attributes, or Essential Per|fections; but do we conceive Bread and Drink to be God, by asking them of God, that is, desiring them, or by rejoicing in them as his Blessing, <HI>i. e.</HI> being pleased, or affect|ed with them as such, or by conceiving he hath put any virtue into them to do us Good? Do we ascribe unto the Creature any of the Divine Attributes or Perfections, or say in effect they are <HI>Omnipotent,</HI> by thinking God may enable them to raise pleasing Sensations in us; or to work upon our Animal Spirits, and by them upon our Souls? Surely could there be any semblance of Idolatry in this case, it must wholly lie not in conceiving that Creatures can move our Animal Spirits, which is all we say or think they do, but in conceiving that these Animals Spirits can act
<PB N="103" REF="60">
upon the Soul, and that these Motions of them can be grateful, or ungrateful to it?</P>
<P>The words of the <HI>Apostle Iohn</HI> run thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Love not the World,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Object.</HI></NOTE> <HI>neither the things that are in the World;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John 2.15, 16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>if any Man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him: For all that is in the World, the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life is not of the Fa|ther, but is of the World. And the World passeth away, and the Lusts thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 65, 66.</P>
<P><HI>Non hoc dici|tur sed sit mo|dus propter Creatorem.</HI> August. in locum.</P></NOTE>
<Q>Here you have again all Love of the World expresly forbidden, as altogether inconsistent with the Love of God; <HI>not the immoderate Love of the World only</HI>: For, 'tis plain that the words import a great deal more, namely, That <HI>we are not to love the World at all</HI>; that all Love of it is immoderate.</Q></P>
<P>To this the Reverend Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI> Answers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE> that
<Q>The <HI>Apostle</HI> explains himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. Vol.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 318.</NOTE> that by the World he means those things which are most generally embraced and practised in it; <HI>the Lust,</HI> or <HI>the desire of the Flesh,</HI> that is Sensuality and Intemperance; <HI>the Lust of the Eyes</HI>; that is Envy, Covetousness, vain Curiosity, and the like; <HI>the Ostenta|tion</HI> or <HI>Boasting of Life,</HI> that is Pride, Am|bition, vain Glory, Arrogance, Qualities as irreconcilably opposite to the Holy Na|ture and Will of God, so altogether incon|sistent with the Love of him, begetting in us an Aversation and Antipathy towards him, rendring his Holiness distasteful to our Affections, his Justice dreadful to our Con|sciences,
<PB N="104" REF="61">
and Himself consequently, his Will, his Law, his Presence hateful to us.</Q>
And that this is the true import of the words, is highly probable; 1. Because <HI>these things,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>are not of the Father</HI>: Whereas the moderate Desire of, and Affection to the World's Good things, is of that God who hath implanted in us natural Affections and Propensions to them, made them the Objects of our Desires and our Industry, encouraged us to affect them by making the matter of his Promises, and hath allowed us to rejoice in them. 2. Because he saith, <HI>He that loveth the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</HI> which cannot possibly be true of that Relative and Subordinate Love unto it, which he hath made Provisions for.</P>
<P>Again, if we understand by these things, the desire of those things which gratifie our Appetites with Pleasure, <HI>V. G.</HI> by <HI>the Lusts of the Flesh,</HI> the desire of Meat, Drink, and vo|luptuous Enjoyments, as they do gratifie the Flesh; by <HI>the Lust of the Eye,</HI> the desire of Gold, Silver, large Possessions, noble Houses, rich Furniture, fair Gardens, as they do gra|tifie the Eye. By <HI>the Pride of Life,</HI> the desire of Places of Dignity, Noble Titles, all the Honour and Glory of the World, as they gra|tifie our Thirst of Honour. Hath he not told us, That the pleasing Sensations which pro|duce these desires in us are <HI>not of the World, i. e.</HI> the things contained in it, but <HI>of the Fa|ther</HI>; that they are <HI>the natural,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 17, 18.</NOTE> <HI>genuine, and direct Effects of God</HI>; that 'tis <HI>of the proper Na|ture of God to produce them</HI>; that <HI>he wills them for themselves, and naturally delights in them,</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="61">
and therefore sure would have us to will and delight in them, and consequently to desire them. What then remains but that we should understand by the love and desire of these things, that immoderate love and desire which tends to captivate our Affections to them; and to prevail upon us to transgress the Will of God, that we may enjoy or preserve them, that is, the immoderate love and desire of these things.</P>
<P>I proceed now to consider what Mr. <HI>N.</HI> objects from reason against our Relative Af|fection to the Creature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 4.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> our love of it in Relation to God.</P>
<P><Q>Now as, saith he, to worship the Creature,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Minus te amat Domine qui tecum aliquid amat quod proper te non amat.</HI> Aug. Solil. c. 19.</NOTE> though but Rela|tively, is to give that Worship to the Creature which is proper to to God, so to love the Creature though but relatively, is in like manner to give that love to the Creature which is proper to God;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Non ista propter se sed is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">a propter illum diligas.</HI> Med. c. 4.</NOTE> and if this be thought a sufficient reason to disallow of a Relative Worship, I cannot see why we should not, for the same reason, give Sentence against this Relative Love; or why one should not be reckoned <HI>Idolatry</HI> as well as the o|ther.</Q></P>
<P>To this I Answer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE> (1.) That Mr. <HI>N.</HI> was formerly of another mind; for in his Discourse of <HI>Platonick Love</HI> he speaks thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 443.</NOTE>
<Q>Because God is of too sublime and refined Excel|lency to be fastned on immediately by our
<PB N="106" REF="62">
Love, <HI>Plato</HI> recommends to us <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>a method of Ascent,</HI> which is from loving the Beauty which we see in Bodies, to pass on to the love of that Beauty which we see in the Soul; from the Beauty of the Soul, to the Beauty of Virtue; and lastly, from the Beauty of Virtue, to the immense O|cean of Beauty; <HI>and these,</HI> saith he, <HI>are the Steps of the Sanctuary.</HI></Q>
Now do we not find here all that Mr. <HI>N.</HI> condemns in our Rela|tive Love? <HI>viz.</HI> the love of the Creatures by way of Relation to God, not as the only, but the final and ultimate Object of our Love; a love of that Creature for God's sake, or in Relation to God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. Vol.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 75.</NOTE> provided that it do not stop and fix at the Creature, <HI>but run on till at last it fix upon God as its final Object.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reas. and Rel. p.</HI> 244.</NOTE>Again, <HI>We ought,</HI> saith he, <HI>to make God the direct and primary Object of our Love, and to love nothing for it self, but only in and for God.</HI> In his Aspiration he speaks thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 246.</NOTE> <HI>My God, I will love thee as thou teachest me; the first and direct Motion of my Love shall be towards thee; and whatever I love besides thee, I will only love in and for thee.</HI> And doth he not here say, that he is taught of God to love other things besides God for his sake?</P>
<P>In his <HI>Essay upon Contemplation and Love,</HI> he saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sect.</HI> 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>God ought to be the ultimate end of all our Actions; and we ought not in any of our Actions</HI> (and therefore not in our Love) <HI>to stop short of this Center, but in all our Actions to make a farther Reference either actual or habitual.</HI> And again,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sect.</HI> 5.</NOTE> <HI>An end may become evil by being rested in, when it is not the last, without any farther re|spect or reference.</HI> So that 'tis the want of this
<PB N="107" REF="62">
respect and reference, which renders the love of the Creature evil.</P>
<P>And now to shew what little cause he had to parallel this Relative Love of the Creature, with the <HI>Relative Worship</HI> we condemn in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and so unhappily to pro|nounce all Christians Guilty of <HI>Idolatry,</HI> who love any thing besides God for his sake, I need only to remind him of a few things which, had they been considered, would have put him out of love with this Compa|rison, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the distinction of <HI>Relative Wor|ship</HI> is proper to the Worship of <HI>Images,</HI> which can deserve no Worship for themselves, but as they represent some Object which deser|veth Worship: Now to say thus of all infe|rior good things, that they can deserve no Love, or cannot be desirable for any real Goodness God hath put into them, is to beg the Question.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Motus qui est in Imaginem quantum est Imago, est u|nus &amp; idem cum illo qui est in Rem; &amp; sic sequitur quod eadem reverentia exhibeatur Imagini Christi &amp; ipsi Christo: Cum ergo Christus adoratur adoratione latriae&punc; consequens est, quod ejus Imago sit adoratione latriae adoranda.</HI> Aquin.

Part. Th. To. 1. Disp. 54.

<PB N="108" REF="63">
to God and Christ, to the Cross, and to the Image, which is a Creature of their own ma|king. Now can Mr. <HI>N.</HI> charge us with gi|ving the same love to the Creature which we give to the Creator? Moreover, we charge them with <HI>Idolatry,</HI> for doing this with <HI>the same Individual inward and outward Act</HI>; now can Mr. <HI>N.</HI> charge us with loving the Crea|ture by the same Individual desire with which we love God.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Relative Worship which they do give to <HI>Images</HI> is plainly forbid in the Se|cond Commandment, but as this cannot be said of this Relative Love without begging the Question; so I have sufficiently proved alrea|dy, that it is highly approved in the <HI>Holy Scri|ptures,</HI> That God hath made Provisions for it, accepts of it, and doth encourage us to per|form it, as will be still more evident by an Instance proper to this Subject, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

terminating upon God and Christ, and yet a Love highly acceptable to God, and such as he hath promised richly to reward; but then it is not love of the same kind with that Affection which I owe to God, as being not an <HI>Elicite,</HI> or an <HI>immediate Act of Religion,</HI> as is the love of God, but only an <HI>Imperate</HI> Act of it, as the <HI>Schools</HI> speak; it proceeds not from the same act which carries me directly to God, the love of God being the Cause, that of Man the Effect; it is not done by any act of my mind <HI>joining God and the Crea|ture together, as one integral Object,</HI> but it is love to the Creature for that Relation which it hath and bears to God and Christ, and therefore 'tis not a forbidden, but a very ac|ceptable kind of Love, though it be plainly Relative.</P>
<P>And so it is also in our Love of Desire to the Creature; for I love them for God and for Christ's sake, when I desire them that I may have wherewith to feed Christ's hungry, and clothe his naked Members, and in all the other Instances fore-mentioned. 'Tis there|fore evident, that this Relative Love, and the <HI>Papists Relative Worship</HI> of <HI>Images,</HI> are so far from being <HI>exactly Parallel,</HI> as Mr. <HI>N.</HI> asserts, that they have nothing common to each o|ther but this, that both are stiled Relative, which also happens in that love of Benevo|lence for God's sake, he allows of.</P>
<P>But saith Mr. <HI>N.</HI>
<Q>Either Creatures are truly and really lovely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 5. <HI>Object.</HI></NOTE> as being our true and proper Good, or they are not; if they
<PB N="110" REF="64">
are, then a Relative Love is too little; we ought to love them with more than a Re|lative Love; we ought to love them abso|lutely and for themselves; but if they are not, then even a Relative Love is too much; for what is not truly lovely, is always loved too much, if it be lov'd at all: So that either way there is no pretence for admitting this last Expedient of our Con|cupiscence, the Relative Love of the Crea|ture.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE>To this I Answer, That when he saith, <HI>The Creature is not our true and proper Goods,</HI> this may be taken in the most elevated Sense, in which God only is our <HI>true and pro|per Good,</HI> and then his Argument runs thus. Either Creatures are to be loved as our God, or else they are not to be loved at all; and this Consequence I hope is not <HI>as clear as the day</HI>; or it may be taken in a large sense for that which is the Good of the whole Man, Soul and Body, and then also I deny that what is not thus lovely, is not to be loved at all; for I may love, because I may desire my daily Bread, though it be not the proper Good of my Soul, but of my Body only. Or lastly, our true and proper Good may signifie that only which is some way condu|cing to our Good, to the Advantage and Comfort of this present Life, as being instru|mental to the Sustentation, and the Content|ment, and Pleasure of this Life, or to our Preservation from those afflictive Evils which are incident to us in this Life; and all that in
<PB N="111" REF="64">
this lower sense is lovely, may be loved, and yet not loved <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Non te prohibet Deut amare ista, sed non dili|gere ad beatudinem, sed ad hoc probare &amp; laudare ut ames creatorem.</HI> August. in Ep.

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI> 2.</NOTE> Therefore I add, That Creatures may be said to be loved <HI>absolutely, and for themselves,</HI> either as that imports only <HI>for the Goodness God hath put into them,</HI> the Good they do, the Pleasure they afford to our natural Appetites; and in this sense I have proved they may be loved <HI>absolutely, and for them|selves,</HI> and this I also learn from these words of Mr. <HI>N.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Contempl. and Love, p.</HI> 299.</NOTE>
<Q><HI>The Great Author of Nature hath made Provisions for the Entertainment of our natural Faculties, and particular Appetites; all our Senses, Seeing, Hearing, Tasting, Smelling, and Touching have their proper Objects and Opportunities of Pleasure respectively; and the Enjoyment and Indulgence of any of those Ap|petites is then only,</HI> N.

<P>Now sure I may desire that Pleasure of Appetites which <HI>God hath made provision for,</HI> and consequently may desire those particular Objects which afford that Pleasure, since o|therwise that Provision God hath made for the Entertainment of our Animal Falculties must be made in vain. Again, if the <HI>Enjoy|ment of,</HI> and the <HI>Indulgence of these Appetites</HI> is
<PB N="112" REF="65">
<HI>only then restrained, when the great Interests of Happiness are thereby cross'd and defeated</HI>; then the Enjoyment of, and the Indulgence to them is not wholly restrained, and then the desire of that Enjoyment and Indulgence to them is not entirely restained, and therefore in some measure, and in some Circumstances is allow'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 308, 309.</NOTE> He also owns, that <HI>Some repast may be found in the Creature, and that it is Good to be chosen, though not to be rested in</HI>; and may I not then desire that Repast?

<P>But, 2<HI>dly,</HI> to love Creatures <HI>absolutely,</HI> and <HI>for themselves,</HI> may signifie to love them ex|clusively of a Relation to, and the Subordi|nation of that love to God; and in this sense they are not to be loved absolutely, and for themselves.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> Not exclusively of a Relation of them, and our affection to them to God's Glory, seeing <HI>whether we eat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10.31.</NOTE> <HI>or drink, or whatever we do,</HI> we are to <HI>do</HI> it <HI>all to the Glory of God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Not exclusively of the Subordination of the love of them to the love of God, be|cause we must still love them with that Mo|deration and Indifferency, which will not permit our Affection to them to hazard or obstruct our pursuit of the Supreme Good.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving thus considered the Arguments produced from Scripture against the common Interpretation of this Great Com|mandment,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Him only shalt thou de|sire.</HI></NOTE> and for a love of God wholly <HI>exclusive of all love to,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 12.</NOTE> and <HI>desire of</HI> the Crea|ture, even so far, and so unhappily exclu|sive of it, that we are told, That <HI>he that de|sires any thing besides God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 9. <HI>p.</HI> 202, 203.</NOTE> <HI>whatever he pretend, or however he deceive himself, doth not truly love God;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 201.</NOTE> That <HI>the desire of God, and de|sire of the Creature are in their own Nature in|compatible,</HI> even so incompatible, that <HI>when|ever the Soul moves towards the Creature,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 203.</NOTE> <HI>it must necessarily forsake the Creator.</HI> I now proceed to the Examination of those Arguments from Reason, by which Good Mr. <HI>Norris</HI> and <HI>the Lady</HI> endeavour to establish this Opinion, only premising for the better stating of the Question,</P>
<P>What he, and the <HI>Good Lady</HI> grant to us. And,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 1.</NOTE> They own, That <HI>we may seek and use those sensible things to which,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. Vol.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 73, 74.</NOTE> <HI>by the Order of Na|ture, Pleasure is annexed</HI>; That <HI>they may be in|nocently sought for and used,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Let.</HI> 4. <HI>p.</HI> 75&punc;</NOTE> <HI>though they must not be loved</HI>; That <HI>we may seek and use sensible things for our Good, but we must not love them as
<PB N="116" REF="67">
our Good.</HI> Which in plain terms is affirming and denying the same thing, as is demonstra|ble from Mr. <HI>N.</HI>'s definition of the <HI>love of Con|cupiscence,</HI> for <HI>Pleasure,</HI> saith he, <HI>is Good, even our Good,</HI> seeking Pleasure must suppose a de|sire of it; and that desire is Love, or the effect of Love; for it supposeth <HI>a motion of the Soul</HI> towards it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theory and Reg. of Love, P.</HI> 10.</NOTE> and <HI>Love,</HI> saith he, <HI>is</HI> only <HI>a Motion of the Soul towards Good.</HI></P>
<P>Again, seek and use sensible things for our Good we cannot, whilst we suppose they are not Good for us, <HI>i. e.</HI> that they will do us no Good, if then we may seek, and use sensible things for our Pleasure, and our Good, they must do us Good, and so be our Good: For <HI>That,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 9.</NOTE> saith he, <HI>is our Good, which does us Good.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover it may be enquired why he is so indulgent to our seeking of these things, who will not permit us to love them in the least measure,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 72.</NOTE> and who <HI>contends for</HI> an <HI>utter annihilation of all desire of the Creature</HI>; does not our Saviour say as expresly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 12.29.</NOTE> <HI>Seek not what you shall eat, or what you shall drink</HI>; as St. <HI>Iohn</HI> doth, <HI>love not the World?</HI> Does not his <HI>Apostle</HI> say as expresly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10.24.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Let no Man seek his own things?</HI> And can he tell us any reason why of two things equally pro|hibited, we may be allowed the one, and not the other, or why the Prohibition of lo|ving or desiring the Creature should be en|tirely exclusive of all love and all desire of the Creature, and yet the prohibition of seeking and <HI>minding</HI> the Creature should not be as ex|clusive of all seeking and all minding of it?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 3.1, 2.</NOTE> But to proceed:</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="67"><HI>This,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 4. <HI>p.</HI> 75, 76.</NOTE> saith he in his Letter, <HI>I farther illu|strate thus, you are to distinguish betwixt the Movements of the Soul and those of the Body; the Movements of the Soul ought not to tend but towards him who only is above her, and only able to act in her, but the Movements of the Body may be determined by those Objects which en|viron it; and so by those Movements we may unite our selves to those things which are the Na|tural or Occasional Causes of our Pleasure, thus because we find Pleasure from Fire,</HI> N. B. <HI>this is warrant enough to approach it by a Bodily Move|ment, but we must not therefore love it; for Love is a Movement of the Soul:</HI> And <HI>that we are to reserve for him who is the true cause of that Pleasure which we resent by occasion of the Fire; who, as I have proved, is no other than God, by which you may plainly perceive what 'tis I mean, by saying, that Creatures may be sought for our good, but not loved as our Good. But this,</HI> saith he, <HI>is more intelligible than practicable.</HI> But,</P>
<P N="1">1. Is this Philosophy suitable to the Language of the Holy Ghost; doth he speak as if we sought and approach'd the Creature only by a Bodily Movement, and not with any Move|ments of the Soul.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 12.15.</NOTE> Doth not he say, <HI>Not|withstanding thou mayst kill and eat flesh in all thy Gates, whatsoever thy Soul lusteth after, ac|cording to the Blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ver.</HI> 20.</NOTE> <HI>When the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy Borders, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh because thy Soul longeth to eat Flesh, thou mayst eat Flesh whatsoever thy Soul lusteth after.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ver.</HI> 21.</NOTE> <HI>Thou shalt kill of thy Herd, and of thy

Flock which the Lord hath given thee, and thou shalt eat in thy Gates whatsoever thy Soul lusteth after, <GAP DESC="foreign">, with all the desire of thy Soul, thou mayst eat,</HI> saith the Hebrew thrice; Thou must do it only by the Movements of the Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 14.26.</NOTE> saith Mr. <HI>N.</HI> Again, <HI>Thou shalt bestow thy Money for whatsoever thy Soul lusteth after, for Oxen, or for Sheep, or for Wine, or for strong Drink, or for whatsoever thy Soul de|sireth.</HI> Where again we find, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the desire of the Soul, <GAP DESC="foreign">, the Concu|piscence of the Soul</HI> allowed to go forth towards Oxen, and Sheep, and Wine, and strong Drink.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ita ut null&acirc; re careat quam animo suo possit ex|petere.</HI> Eccles. 6.2.</NOTE> The Preacher also laments the Folly of the Man who having <HI>Riches, Wealth</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> in such abundance, <HI>that he wanteth no|thing which his Soul can desire,</HI> and yet he hath not an heart to enjoy them freely, and de|light himself in the Good of them. See <HI>Isa.</HI> 58.11, 12. <HI>Rev.</HI> 18.14. So plainly doth the Holy Ghost contradict this <HI>New Philosophy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Is it suitable to the Sentiments of <HI>Mr. N.</HI> when he saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Contempl. and Love, p.</HI> 307.</NOTE> <HI>There are some things in the World which I love,</HI> N. B. <HI>with great passion, such as are Conversation with select Friends, or Men of Harmonical and Tuneable Dispositions, Reading close and fine-wrought Dis|courses, solitary Walks and Gardens, the Beauty of the Spring, and above all, Majestick and well composed Musick; these I delight in with some|thing-like satisfaction and acquiescence, and the last, could I enjoy it in its highest Perfection, would, I am apt to phansie, terminate my Desires, and make me Happy.</HI> Now could he do all this without any Movement of his Soul to|wards
<PB N="119" REF="68">
them? Are none of these things truely and really lovely, because they are Creatures? Or must he <HI>love them too much,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 78.</NOTE> <HI>if he love them at all?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> He is here speaking of <HI>seeking the Creatures for our good:</HI> Now hath the Body any apprehensions of what is for our good? Can it desire, or seek any thing under that Notion? Hath it any apprehension of the Objects that make Impressions on it as the natural or occasional Causes of our Pleasure? Doth that find Pleasure from the Fire, or re|member that it did so? Is it not evidently the Soul that apprehends, remembers, seeks, desires, and doth all these things? How un|intelligible therefore is it to talk of all these things only as Movements of the Body, and and not as Movements of the Soul? To take his own Instance, Do we approach to the Fire by a Bodily movement without desiring the Fire, and expecting Pleasure from it? And is not this desire and expectation a move|ment of the Soul? Is it not the Soul which moves those animal Spirits into those Parts and Muscles by which we are enabled to ap|proach the Fire by a bodily movement: So that, as far as I am able to perceive, here is nothing true, nothing satisfactory, I had al|most said nothing intelligible in this pretended Illustration.</P>
<P>Moreover, when <HI>He,</HI> and <HI>the Lady,</HI> allow us to move toward these things, only <HI>as the Occasions,</HI> not <HI>as the Causes of our Good,</HI> I ask, Is not the continuance of my Life and Being good? And is Food only the occasion, is it
<PB N="120" REF="69">
not the means by God appointed for the con|tinuance of Life? Is Physick only the occa|sion, is it not the means of my Health? Is sleep only the occasion, is it not the means of my Refreshment? And so of the Pleasure that we find in the Recovery of our Health, and the Refreshments of our wearied Spirits?</P>
<P>And lastly, were it true that God is the immediate cause of all the Pleasure that we find in the Creature, was any Body acquaint|ed with this Notion till these latter days? Doth one in Ten thousand now believe it? Are the generality of Men capable of Un|derstanding it? And must not then all who in former Ages did not, and who at present cannot understand, or believe it, lie under a necessity of desiring the Creature, as the true cause of their Pleasure, and so have a move|ment of the Soul toward it as such? So that this matter is both impracticable and unin|telligible.</P>
<P>The Notion also seems as useless, as 'tis un|intelligible; for am I not as much obliged to God for the Benefit and Pleasure I receive from any of his Creatures, whether he do immediately produce that Pleasure in me by occasion of them, or doth produce in me those Faculties by which I am enabled to per|ceive the Pleasure they afford? Is not the Pleasure which reflects from them as occa|sions, or as natural Causes of it, still the same? And is not the Giver of these Faculties and Creatures the sole Author of it? Is not <HI>causa causae, causa causati?</HI> Must not he who is the efficient cause of all those Faculties by which
<PB N="121" REF="69">
I perceive Pleasure from the Creatures his Providence affords me, be the true efficient cause of all my Pleasure? Is it not the same Kindness to give me Money to build me an House, and to pay my Debts my self, as to build an House or pay my Debts for me, since either way my Debts are equally paid, and my House built, and the Benefit is the same.</P>
<P>In fine, Doth this Notion tend at all to abate or lessen our desires of the Creature? Not at all. For be it supposed, that they are only occasions of our Pleasure, yet are they granted to such occasions as are always at|tended with this Pleasure, and without which it would not be produced in us by God. If then the Object be as pleasing as it would be, provided God had lodged a power in it to excite this Pleasure in me, and given me Fa|culties to perceive it without his immediate Operation, as certainly it is, then is it also equally desirable; it being the Pleasure it self, not the efficient of it, that I do desire.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>N.</HI> saith, <HI>We must not desire them as our Good, because they do us no Good; they afford us no Pleasure,</HI> but God doth upon occasion of them. A very <HI>Metaphysical</HI> Consideration, which scarce any one regards in the pursuit of his Pleasure, and which will abate no Man's desire of it, for the Gratification of the Ap|petite, the Enjoyment of the Delight, and the pleasing Sentiment is that thing desired and pursued.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 73.</NOTE> Now the Creatures being al|lowed to be the <HI>positive Conditions</HI> upon which God by his immutable Law and Order stands
<PB N="122" REF="70">
obliged to give these Gratifications and De|lights, and without which he will not pro|duce in us one of these pleasing Sentiments, must not my pursuit of Pleasure, and desire of it, oblige me to desire and pursue that without which I know I cannot have it, and with which I am sure I cannot want it? they being the <HI>positive Conditions determining the Operation of God,</HI> to produce this Pleasure in me, <HI>i. e.</HI> to give me that which only I desire and pursue, and for which only I desire the Creature. However it is granted,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That <HI>we may seek and use sensible things for our Good</HI>; and hence it is inferred, that we may desire and be pleased with, that is, may love them as our Good; because it is the ap|prehension of them as Good to us, or as things which may do us Good, which moveth us to use and seek them for our Good.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> 'Tis also granted, That <HI>we may unite our selves, and approach to them by the Movements of the Body,</HI> which Movements of the Body being not Mechanical Motions, but caused by some Movements of the Soul to|wards them; hence, I conclude, we may ap|proach or unite our selves to them also by some Movements of the Soul; which is the thing denied by Mr. <HI>N.</HI></P>
<P>And having premised this, I proceed direct|ly to return an Answer to the Arguments by which Mr. <HI>N.</HI> endeavours to establish his O|pinion, That <HI>the Love of God is exclusive of all Love of the Creature,</HI> and doth require us <HI>in Iustice to withdraw every straggling Desire from it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="70">I confess, the <HI>Incomparable Lady</HI> hath let fall some words, which seem to lay an Imputa|tion of the worst of Follies upon this attempt. Her words are these,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 11. <HI>p.</HI> 260.</NOTE>
<Q><HI>I will not search for Arguments to inforce this Love, after those incomparable ones you have so well inculcated, which are indeed unanswerable</HI>; And not to be opposed by any thing, but that which is as unconquerable, as it is unaccountable, wilful Folly.</Q>

But though these be indeed hard Strokes, I'm sure they come from a very soft and tender hand, and from as sweet a temper'd Soul as lives in Flesh. They there|fore must be taken by the right handle, and must be thought to be intended as an high Compliment to Mr. <HI>N.</HI> not as an imputation of Folly to all that should oppose his incom|parable Inforcements of his Tenet. Passing them therefore over with this gentle touch, I pass on to a Consideration of the Argu|ments of Mr. <HI>N.</HI> contained in his <HI>Sermon,</HI> and in his <HI>Letters.</HI></P>
<P>Then he argues thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argument</HI> 1.</NOTE>
<Q>God is the only Cause of our Love,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 2.</NOTE> that is, of that Bent or Endeavour whereby the Soul of Man stands inclined to Good in General;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 13, 14, 15.</NOTE> this No|tion of our Souls being a necessary Adhe|rent to our Beings, such as we never were without, and such as we never can put off. Now if God be the only Author and Cause of our Love, has He not then the Sole Right and Title to it? If He does as much Produce my Love, as He doth my Being, why hath He not as much
<PB N="124" REF="71">
Right to my Love, as to any part of my Nature?</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE>This Argument proves nothing to the pur|pose, by his own Confession; for it only proves that God is the Cause of all that Love which is a <HI>necessary Adherent to our Beings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. P.</HI> 13 14.</NOTE> <HI>such</HI> as is <HI>all over invincible and irresistible</HI>; of that mo|tion of Love <HI>in which we are purely passive, over which we have no more Command, than over the motion of our Heart and Pulse</HI>; which <HI>we can never controul; can never be without; never can put off</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. Vol.</HI> 3. <HI>P.</HI> 213.</NOTE> which the <HI>Devils</HI> and <HI>Damned Spirits,</HI> saith he, have, as well as <HI>Glorified Saints.</HI> Now is this the Love God calls for in this Text? Is it a purely passive Love which it is not in the Power of <HI>Devils</HI> to withhold, and in which the greatest <HI>Saints</HI> cannot excel them? Is God concerned that we should not want that which is a necessary Adherent of our Beings? That which we never can put off, never can be with without? Doth he require that only which no Man can defraud him of? Mr. <HI>N.</HI> is sensible that the Text is not at all concerned in this Love, confessing that <HI>our Free Love is the only Love that falls under Com|mand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 10. <HI>p.</HI> 231.</NOTE> and <HI>the only one that is in our Power.</HI> And why then doth he argue from such a Love, to that Free, Active Love, which too many are without, and too many do put off; or from that Love which cannot be, to that Love which is commanded. Moreover</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI> 2.</NOTE>This Argument plainly destroys the thing it was designed to establish: For he lays down his <HI>Thesis</HI> thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 12.</NOTE> That <HI>our whole Affections are to
<PB N="125" REF="71">
be placed on God, and that we are to love him so intirely, as to love none but him. This,</HI> saith he, <HI>I shall endeavour to establish upon this double Basis,</HI> (1.) <HI>That God is the only Author, or Cause of our Love.</HI> And will it not hence follow, that he is the only Author and Cause of our Natural Love, Bent, and Inclination to every thing besides himself? And can he be the only Au|thor and Cause of our Love to all other things, and yet forbid that very love which he alone produceth in us? <HI>God,</HI> saith Mr. <HI>N. is the Author of all my Love, he hath produced it all, 'tis therefore highly just and reasonable he should have it all.</HI> God, say I then, is the Au|thor of all the Love of my self, and of my Preservation, my love of Food, Drink, Cloths, of Honour, Riches, Pleasure, Life, my love of Women, and of Sensual Delights, and of the <HI>Gratification of all my Natural Appetites ac|cording to,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 7. <HI>p.</HI> 150.</NOTE> <HI>and not exceeding the Intention of</HI> (the God of) <HI>Nature,</HI> which is acknowledged to be Pleasure.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 10. <HI>p.</HI> 221.</NOTE> And <HI>the natural tendency we have to them being from the Author of Nature must needs be right, it being impossible</HI> (saith Mr. <HI>N.</HI>) <HI>that God should put a Biass upon the Soul.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 222.</NOTE> If therefore <HI>it is the Perfection and Duty of every Rational Creature to conform those Determina|tions of his Will that are free, to that which is natural, or to take care that the Love of his Na|ture, and the Love of his Choice conspire in one, that they both agree in the same Motion, and concenter in the same Object,</HI> as he saith it is, then 'tis the Duty and Perfection of our Nature to chuse to Love, or freely to affect the Preser|vation of our Life and Being, our Food,
<PB N="126" REF="72">
Drink, Cloths, Honour, Riches, Pleasure, and the Gratification of all our Natural Ap|petites according to, and not exceeding the Intention of the God of Nature. Again, God is the Cause and Author of all my Love of my self, of my desire of Self-Preservation, and of all that I judge needful for, and pleasant to me. He is the Author of all that natural <GAP DESC="foreign"> we bear to our Relations, and also of that love we owe unto our Neighbour, as having made him in all considerable Respects the same with us, or equal to us, and therefore equally deserving our Affection, and having founded it on this clear Principle of Nature, That <HI>we should deal with others as we would be dealt with.</HI> Will therefore Mr. <HI>N.</HI> say, That be|cause God is the Author of all this Love of Benevolence, 'tis just and reasonable he should have it all? No sure; the utmost that he can reasonably hence conclude is this, that it is just and reasonable we should only love our selves, our Relatives and Neighbou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s in rela|tion to God, or in Subordination to him. And this is likewise all he can rationally con|clude from God's being the Author of our Love of desire, <HI>viz.</HI> That we should desire nothing, but with Relation to, or in Subordi|nation, and Submission to him.</P>
<P>In a word, as God is the sole efficient Cause of my Intellectual Love in the true <HI>Phi|losophical</HI> Sense, by giving me the Faculties, and the Liberty by which I chuse Intellectual Good; so also on the same is he the cause of all my sensual Love, <HI>i. e.</HI> of my Love of the Body, of all the Conveniences and innocent
<PB N="127" REF="72">
Delights of it, as also the sensual Love of Beasts. And must he therefore be the Proper and Immediate, yea, the <HI>Sole Object</HI> of this Love?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett. of Love and Musick, p.</HI> 446.</NOTE> Do you not <HI>call that a sensual Desire, whose Object is a sensual Good?</HI> And is God such a one? <HI>A Man</HI> saith Mr. <HI>N. is in Love, that is, he hath a sensual Desire toward a sensual Good.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 447.</NOTE> <HI>And this,</HI> saith he, <HI>cannot be evil; for then 'twould be a sin to be in Love, and conse|quently there would be a necessity of sinning, in order to Marriage, because no Man</HI> (not there|fore Mr. <HI>N.</HI>) <HI>is supposed to Marry but whom he thus loves</HI>; and so Mr. <HI>N.</HI> being Married, had once a sensual Desire of a sensual Good without Sin; and therefore was not obliged by this Commandment to make God the on|ly Object of his Love of Desire. And in|deed 'tis palpably absurd to say, I do God <HI>In|jury or Injustice</HI> in loving or desiring those<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 15.</NOTE> things which he hath given me Faculties on purpose to love and desire, which have no other use but to desire, which cannot be sa|tisfied without the Enjoyment of what we desire; which if he did not intend we should Gratifie, he gave them only as Snares and Torments to us. God's Right therefore in this Case can be only this, that I never love any sensual Good against him, or to the Dis|honour of him, but rather that I love it only in Relation, or in Subordination, and Sub|mission to him, not that I love it not at all.</P>
<P><Q>I lay down this an evident and unde|niable Proposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argument</HI> 2. &sect;. 3.</NOTE> that the natural Mo|tion of the Will is to Good in General.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 10. <HI>p.</HI> 224.</NOTE>
<PB N="118" REF="73">
But now how can the Will be moved to|wards Good in General, but by being moved towards All Good; for to be mo|ved towards Good as Good, is to be moved towards All Good. And how can the Will be moved towards All Good, but by being moved towards an Universal Be|ing who in himself is, and contains All Good?</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE>This is a piece of <HI>Sophistry,</HI> and a meer Fal|lacy; for when we say the Will is moved to Good in General, the meaning of those words is only this, <HI>That nothing but what is Good in reality or appearance can move the Will,</HI> or <HI>that it is always moved by some or other of those things which are contained within the Compass or the Sphere of Good</HI>; not that in all its Motions or Elections it desires all that can be called Good. <HI>V. G.</HI> I desire to eat when I am hun|gry, to drink when I am thirsty, to take my rest when I am sleepy, not that I think All that is Good is contained in my Food, Drink or Sleep.</P>
<P>Moreover, to be moved <HI>towards Good as Good,</HI> is not to be moved <HI>towards All Good,</HI> but to be moved towards any particular Object, <HI>sub ratione boni,</HI> under this Prospect that it is, some way or other, Good for me to enjoy that Object; even as to be moved towards <HI>Evil as Evil, i. e. sub ratione mali</HI> is not to be moved to all that is evil, but to be moved to evil, under the Apprehension or Conviction that it is evil,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 10. <HI>p.</HI> 228.</NOTE> or pernicious to me. And this we cannot do; not <HI>because we have no motion
<PB N="129" REF="73">
from God towards it, but to the contrary</HI>; which Mr. <HI>N.</HI> phancies to be the only reason why we cannot possibly Will, or Love evil, as evil. For that would prove as much that we cannot love Evil at all, under the false ap|pearance of Good; for sure <HI>we have no motion to it from God</HI> under that false appearance, but to the contrary: Sure the desiring of Evil can in no sense be the natural and <HI>proper effect of that great Impression whereby God moves us con|tinually towards himself.</HI> But the plain reason of it is, because to Will <HI>Evil, as Evil,</HI> is to desire it because it is not desirable; which is, to move towards it without a motive. And, 2<HI>dly,</HI> because 'tis to desire what is pernicious to me, because it is so; which is contrary to the first Principle of self-Preservation God hath planted in us. And hence ariseth also a demonstration, that the Will is not always moved to Good in General, or towards all Good, because it is so often and so power|fully moved to Good apparent only, which being in it self Evil, and only in appearance Good, we can have no motion to it from that God whom, saith he, we move to by moving towards Good in General, nor can it be the effect of <HI>that General impression by which God moves us continually to himself.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>N.</HI> farther argues thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argument</HI> 3. &sect;. 4.</NOTE>
<Q>That as God is the Author of this motion, so is he the end of it too,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Serm. p.</HI> 17.</NOTE> and he moves us to good no otherwise than by moving us towards him|self. For can God move us towards the Creature? Can he move us from himself?
<PB N="130" REF="74">
Can he act for a Creature? Can he make a Creature his end? Does not God make all things for himself? Is he not always his own end? Hath not this the evidence of a first Principle, that God acts only for him|self?</Q>

How can either of these kinds of self-love de|rive from him, in whom can be no Indi|gence; or terminate in him, who is capable of no addition to his infinite and necessary Perfection, and as incapable of any diminu|tion from them? Again, when he saith, <HI>God Wills and Acts for himself,</HI> what doth he

mean? Is it, that he Wills, and Acts for that which he hath already, and cannot chuse but have, or for what he hath not?

If the first, why should he Will or Act for what he hath already, and cannot chuse but have? Can he have it the more for doing so?

<P>Doth not the <HI>Scripture</HI> say,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Object.</HI></NOTE> <HI>God hath made all things for himself?</HI> Prov. 16.4.</P>
<P>I answer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE> It doth so, according to our Translation: but in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> the word is <GAP DESC="foreign"> from <GAP DESC="foreign">; and so the words may be thus rendred, the Lord hath made all things to answer to themselves, <GAP DESC="foreign">, aptly to refer one to another; even the wicked for the day of Wrath, according to that descant of the Learned <HI>Grotius, Singula Deus ordinat ad id quod singulis convenit; ordinat impium ad diem calamitosum.</HI> The <HI>Targum</HI> and the <HI>Sy|riac</HI> render the words thus, <HI>The Lord doth all things for them that obey, and reserveth the wick|ed for the evil day.</HI> The <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Ely</HI> renders them thus, <HI>The Lord disposeth all things,</HI> Lam|maanthu, <HI>according to his Will, even the Wicked for the day of wrath, i. e.</HI> to be then the Exe|cutioners of it.

would he be content with the old Divinity, <HI>That God loves Himself with a Love of Complacency</HI>; and <HI>that God doth all things for his Glory</HI>; and that in this Sense <HI>all things are of him, and to him, Rom.</HI> 11.36. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.6. <HI>Col.</HI> 1.16. he would have no Adversary.

Strom. 5. p. 585. B. Eadem verba lau|dat Theodoretus adv. Graecos, Serm. 4. p. 535.</NOTE> so doth it seem to them a vain Imagination to conceive the great design of any of God's glorious Works, and admirable Dispensations should be only this, to be ad|mired and applauded by us worthless Creatures; that he may gain Esteem, or a good Word from such vile Creatures as we are. We take too much upon us, if we imagine that the All|wise God can be concerned whether such blind Creatures as we are, approve or disap|prove of his Proceedings; or that he really can suffer any diminution of his Glory by our dislike, or is advanced in honour by our ap|probation of his Dispensations. We think too meanly of, and we detract from his Great Majesty, if we conceive that he is tickled with Applause, and chiefly aims at Reputation from us in all his glorious Designs, this being such a weakness in our fellow-Creature, as is stiled Ambition, and <HI>loving of the Praise of Men,</HI> a Crime which he will punish in them; and so it cannot be the great Design of all the Dispensations of his Providence. That
<PB N="135" REF="76">
therefore, such as we should think well of him can be no farther his concern, than as it serves the nobler Ends of his great Goodness; <HI>viz.</HI> that these Conceptions may engage us to that Affection to, that Imitation of him, and that Obedience to him, which tends to the promotion of our Happiness.</P>
<P>God therefore acteth for his Glory when he discovers to the World those Excellencies and Perfections of his Nature, which are just motives to the performance of that Duty which we owe unto him; or when he doth display before us those imitable. Perfections in which it is our Glory to be like him. But then, it farther is to be observed, that God, in the discovery of these Divine Perfections to the World, designs as well the Benefit and Happiness of Man, as the advancement of his Honour. For when he doth discover all those Attributes which represent him Good and Merciful, kind and obliging to the Sons of Men, he doth it with design, and in a man|ner very proper to lay the highest Obliga|tions on us to Returns of Love and Gratitude, and to engage us to that Imitation of his Goodness and Mercy to our fellow Crea|tures, which renders us partakers of the <HI>Di|vine Nature,</HI> and helpful to others in all their Exigencies and Distresses. When he gives signal Demonstrations of his Almighty Power, and of his great Wisdom, he designs by this to teach us, that he is able to foresee, and to divert those Evils which may at any time be|fal us; to rescue us from all our Miseries, and to confer the greatest Blessings on his Ser|vants;
<PB N="136" REF="77">
that so he may encourage us to place our Trust in him at all times, to repair by humble Suppli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ations to the Throne of Grace for suitable help in time of need, and to serve him faithfully in expectation of his Favour and Protection. When he manifests himself to be a God of Truth, and Faithfulness, one who will punctually perform his promises to, and execute his Threats upon us, he doth this chiefly to affright us from those Sins which make it necessary for his Justice to be severe upon us, and to provoke us to the per|formance of those Duties to which he hath annexed the greatest Blessings. When he in|forms us, that his Holiness and Justice can|not permit the Wicked to escape his Ven|geance, or any upright Soul to want the tokens of his Love, or the reward of his sin|cere Obedience; his great design in all this is, that Sin, which is the rise of all our Miseries, may be avoided, and Holiness, which is the true advancement, and the best accomplish|ment of Humane Nature, may be more ear|nestly pursued by us. So that God's acting for his Glory, is also acting for the Good of his most noble Creatures; 'tis only recom|mending himself to their good Liking and Af|fection, that so he may the more effectually promote their Happiness. Nor is his Will that we should act for his Glory any self-cen|tring Principle, terminating in himself; but 'tis a Principle of great Good-will and kind|ness to Mankind, and terminating in his Hap|piness: Whereas Mr. <HI>N.</HI>'s account of God's Love, his Will and Actings, doth render him
<PB N="137" REF="77">
the most selfish Being that we can imagine; one <HI>who can love nothing but himself, will and do nothing but purely for himself.</HI> Our Charity must be such as <HI>seeketh not our own things</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13.5.</NOTE> it must engage us <HI>not to seek our own,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>ch.</HI> 10.23.</NOTE> <HI>but every Man anothers Good,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2.4.</NOTE> and to <HI>please him for his Good:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 15.2.</NOTE> Our Friendship purely must respect the Welfare of our Friend, and when we ex|ercise our Charity, or pretend Friendship purely from prospect of our own Advantage, our Friendship becomes <HI>Mercenary,</HI> and our Charity degenerates into <HI>Self-love,</HI> And to this Charity and Friendship we are incited chiefly by the Example of our God, and yet it seems his Love <HI>terminates only in himself,</HI> and <HI>can be no other than the love of himself</HI>; and how then can it oblige me to the foremen|tioned Charity and Friendship to my Neigh|bour for his sake.</P>
<P>To this Question therefore, <HI>Can God move us towards a Creature? Can he move us from himself?</HI> I Answer, Yes he doth move us to|wards the Creatures by all those Appetites, Affections and Desires he hath implanted in our Natures to them, by all the Commands he hath laid upon us to pray for our daily Bread, to be industrious to procure them, and to bless him for them. Does he not move the hungry Appetite to desire Meat, the thirsty Drink, the naked to desire Cloths, the Poor supply of his Wants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And doth he not in all these Cases move us towards the Creature? Hath not God made these things the matter of his Promises, and his Encou|ragements to Duty? entailing upon Godli|ness
<PB N="138" REF="78">
<HI>the Promises of this Life?</HI> and engaging to them who <HI>seek first the Kingdom of God, that all other things shall be added to them? We</HI> there|fore are by him moved towards the Crea|ture, as a motive to the Enjoyment of him|self. And sure thus moving us to the Crea|ture is not to move <HI>us from himself,</HI> but to himself by means very proper to excite us to love, obey, and cleave unto him who doth thus <HI>load us with his Blessings, and poureth his Benefits upon us</HI>; as the whole Book of <HI>Psalms,</HI> and the whole Law of <HI>Moses</HI> testifies.</P>
<P><Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argument</HI> 4. &sect;. 5. <HI>Preface to the Letters.</HI></NOTE>The Love here discoursed of and recom|mended, is the Love of a God, that is, of all that is Good, of all that is Perfect, of all that is Lovely, of all that is Desirable, in short, of all that truly is; and can any Love be too great or too high for such an Object? Or, rather doth he not deserve infinitely more than we, or any of his Creatures can bestow upon him? What, can infinite Good be loved too much? Or is any degree of Love too high for him who is infinitely lovely, and who infinitely loves himself! &mdash;And why then should it be thought such a stretch of the Love of God, to make it intire and exclusive of all other Loves? Can we love God too much, or Creatures too little?</Q></P>
<P>To this I Answer, <HI>First,</HI> That what I have discoursed is sufficient to evince that this is <HI>such a stretch of the Love of God,</HI> as renders it inconsistent with our Duty, and Obligation
<PB N="139" REF="78">
to pray for any temporal Blessings which we want. That it tends to depreciate the Gifts of God, and to impair the sense of Divine Goodness in them; to destroy all our Indu|stry in our Callings, and all pursuit of Tem|poral Enjoyments by our honest Labours: That it removes the natural Foundation of all Injustice, and cramps all charitable Benefi|cence: That it casts a vile Contempt upon the Works both of Creation and of Providence: And lastly, that it casts this imputation upon the Just and Holy God, that he hath made that our Sin, which is Natural and Necessary: As sure it is, to desire Food when we are hun|gry; that he will not allow us to desire what he knows we have need of. It makes him to have planted in us natural Appetites and De|sires which he intended we should gratifie, and yet hath not permitted us to desire that which alone can gratifie them. And sure, if this <HI>Hypothesis</HI> do all, or any of these things, it by so doing must stretch this Duty of the Love of God beyond the bounds prescribed to it by our God, and <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If God be <HI>all that truly is,</HI> all that is not God, truly is not; and what is not, can have no Love to God, or any other thing. So that this stretch of <HI>Metaphysicks</HI> destroys that Love he recommends. Moreover, to say that God is <HI>all that is Good,</HI> is to contra|dict God himself, who said of all the Crea|tures that he made, that <HI>they were very Good:</HI> To say that he is <HI>all that is lovely, all that is desirable,</HI> is to beg the Question. Again, that
<PB N="140" REF="79">
<HI>God deserves infinitely more than we can bestow upon him, that an infinite Good&punc; cannot be loved too much, i. e.</HI> more than he deserves, is very true, but not pertinent; for we can be no more obliged to love God, than we are to serve him as he deserves; which we can ne|ver do: For he deserves to be served answer|ably to the Reward that he hath promised; but can we perform such Service? He de|serves Perfect and Angelical Obedience; but are we therefore, in this State of Imperfecti|on, obliged to it? The Question is not, What is too much for him, if we could perform it, but, What he hath made our Duty, and there|fore doth expect we should perform. Now hath he made it our Duty so to love him, as not to love our selves; not to love Health and Pleasure, not to desire Food and Rai|ment, or any other Blessing he hath promi|sed as the Reward of our Obedience? If not, 'tis evident that Duty of Affection which we owe unto him cannot be exclusive of all love of the Creature.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE>What means he by these Questions?

Was it not usual with him, when he had fed his Hearers with the Bread of Life, the Food that <HI>abideth to Eternal Life,</HI> to feed their Bodies also with his Creatures, and so to send them from the one Food to the other; as knowing well the Bread of Life was never designed to suffice for the Body, or to satisfie those Bodily Appetites which he had

<Q>Lord, I have been so indifferent to|wards those Creatures which are thy signal Blessings, and thy gracious Gifts, to which all Mankind owe the Preservation of their Souls in Life; that I have not thought them worthy of the least desire, or been concern|ed to pray to thee for my daily Bread.

<P>I Answer by way of Concession,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI> 2.</NOTE> That God produceth all our Pleasure, and that he only doth us Good;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>ch.</HI> 1.8.</NOTE> for so the <HI>Apostle Iames</HI> as|sures by saying he is <HI>the Giver of every good and perfect Gift,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 17.25.

may we not desire any other of God's good Creatures, why not fruitful Seasons, why not Food?

Whereas we who con|ceive that Mens <HI>Damnation is of themselves,</HI> that they are their own Tormentors by their re|flection on their own Actions, that they have excluded themselves from the Beatifick Vi|sion which would have made them happy, by making themselves incapable of enjoying a God of infinite Purity, that they have ren|dred themselves unworthy to be snatched out of the Flames of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. 3.7.</NOTE> <HI>when all the things that are in it shall be burned up,</HI> and so shall suffer in <HI>that Fire which is kept for the Day of Iudgment,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thes. 4.17.</NOTE> <HI>and of perdition of ungodly Men,</HI> whilst the Just shall then be <HI>caught up into the Air, and be for ever with the Lord.</HI> We, I say, are not at all concerned in this Objection, though Mr. <HI>N.</HI> imagines that it <HI>lies equally a|gainst us.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 27, 28.</NOTE></P>
<P>Moreover, is it true that <HI>all the Pains which God inflicts upon the Wicked in this Life are Me|dicinal,
<PB N="157" REF="87">
and in order to their greater Good?</HI> What thinks he of the Despair, Horror, the Ago|nies both of Soul and Body some desperately wicked Persons lie under at the hour of death? Of the Pains the bloody <HI>Hector</HI> suffers in a Duel by a mortal Wound? Of the wicked <HI>Soldier</HI> mortally wounded in the Field? The horrid Criminal presently put upon the Rack and there exspiring? The <HI>Atheist</HI> or <HI>Debauched</HI> Person taken away by a sudden stroke or by a violent Death? Do they suffer these Pains in order to a greater Good?</P>
<P><Q>Though I acknowledge Pain,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Repl.</HI> 2. <HI>Let.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 17, 18, 19.</NOTE> saith he, to be as truly the effect of God as Pleasure, yet it is not after the same manner the ef|fect of God, as Pleasure is: Pleasure is the natural, genuine and direct effect of God, but Pain comes from him only indirectly and by accident; for first, 'tis of the pro|per Nature of God to produce Pleasure, as consisting of such essential Excellencies and Perfections as will necessarily beautifie and and make happy those who are, by being in their true rational Order, duly disposed for the Enjoyment of him, but if this same excellent Nature occasion pain to other Spirits, this is only indirectly and by acci|dent, by reason of their moral indisposition for so soveraign a Good.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE></Q></P>
<P><Q>Again, when God causes Pleasure, 'tis be|cause he wills it for it self, and naturally de|lights in it, as comporting with his pri|mary design which is the Happiness of his Creatures, but when he causes Pain, 'tis
<PB N="158" REF="88">
not that he wills it from within, or for it self, but only from without, and for the sake of something else, as it is necessary to the Order of his Justice; for had there been no Sin, there never would have been such a thing as Pain, which is a plain Argument that God wills our Pleasure as we are Crea|tures, and our Pain only as we are Sin|ners; but now in measuring our Devoirs to God, we are not to consider how he stands affected to us as Sinners, but how he stands affected to us as Creatures.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE>Here it is plain the Good Man shifts the Scene, deserts his Subject and his Argument at once, that he may seem to avoid the Con|sequence which follows from it; for evident it is, that in his Sermon he was discoursing of those Pleasures and Pains only which by the impressions the Creatures made upon us were by God produced in us, the Pleasures of the Senses, the Eye, the Palate, the Smell, Taste and Touch, and the Pains incident to them; and from these only is it that he makes his Inference, That <HI>Creatures are not to be loved or desired at all,</HI> as being not the Causes, but the Occasions of these Pleasures, and that God only is to be loved, because he only causes them. Now is this true of these sensual Plea|sures of the Palate, and the Throat, and the Belly, of the carnal Pleasures of the Men of the World, of the Pleasures of Envy, and the Pleasures wicked Men take not only in <HI>doing evil</HI> themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></NOTE> but in <HI>seeing others</HI> do it; of the <HI>Pleasure they take in Rioting in the day time,</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="88">
that 'tis <HI>of the proper Nature of God, as consisting of such essential Excellencies</HI> and Perfections to produce them, rather than to produce in us that <HI>Godly sorrow which works Repentance unto Life,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 7.10.</NOTE> the pangs of the New Birth, or those afflicting Pains he lays upon his Children <HI>for their profit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12.10. <HI>Ver.</HI> 6.</NOTE> <HI>to make them partakers of his Holi|ness,</HI> and which are the Fruits of that Love which is the chief of his Perfections? <HI>When God causeth Pleasure,</HI> saith he, <HI>he doth it because he wills it for it self, and naturally delights in it as comporting with his primary design, which is the Happiness of his Creatures</HI>; does he mean the pleasure of tickling, or of scraching when I have the Itch, or the sensual Pleasures which the Drunkard finds in swallowing down his Liquor, or the Glutton in his delicious Fair, or the Lustful Person in his Unchast Em|braces? No, saith he, <HI>the Pleasures that beau|tifie and make us happy in the Enjoyment of God.</HI> But what is this to that purpose of his Sermon, or his Argument which only concerns the Pleasures which we find upon occasion of the Creatures making impressions on our Senses? Again, <HI>Pain and Pleasure are both truly the ef|fect of God, but not after the same manner,</HI> viz. I approach to the fire and it warms me, <HI>God is the natural, genuine and direct Cause</HI> of this Pleasure: I approach nearer to it, and it burns me, God is the cause of this Pain of burning only <HI>indirectly, and by accident,</HI> the fire is only the occasion of both; God immediately doth both, his Operation is equal|ly determined to do both by the same occa|sion; Who then is able to see any reason
<PB N="160" REF="89">
why he should be thought the <HI>natural, genuine and direct Cause of the first,</HI> and only <HI>indirectly and by accident</HI> the Cause of the latter?</P>
<P>Again, <HI>God,</HI> saith he, <HI>wills our Pleasures as we are Creatures, and our Pain only as we are Sinners.</HI> He would do well to reconcile this with the Sentiments of Mr. <HI>Malbranch,</HI> That <HI>we being Sinners,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Entr.</HI> 3. <HI>p.</HI> 91.</NOTE> <HI>and by consequence unworthy to be recompens'd by agreeable Sentiments, oblige God, in consequence of his immutable Will to make us feel Pleasure in the time that we offend him:</HI> What also doth he think of the Pains of Bruit Beasts, which by his Argument must be pro|duced by God only; Doth God produce in them pain only as they are Sinners? What of the pains of the <HI>Holy Martyrs</HI> flagrant in Flames of Love to God, are they inflicted on them only as they are Sinners? Is it not for the Tryal of their Faith, Patience, Love and Obedience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 1.7.</NOTE> that <HI>the Tryal of their Faith might be found to their Praise, Honour and Glory at the Revelation of the Lord Iesus?</HI> What thinks he of the direful Agonies and Sufferings of the <HI>Blessed Iesus,</HI> was he also a Sinner? Did he not <HI>for the Ioy that was set before him endure the Cross</HI>?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hebr. 12.2.</NOTE></P>
<P>In fine, 'tis certain that the Wicked find the same sentiments of Delight and sensual Pleasures in their sinful, as do the Righteous in their lawful Actions; <HI>viz.</HI> the lustful Person in his unchast Embraces, as the Good Man in the Marriage-Bed. 'Tis certain also that these sensual Delights and Pleasures are very ob|structive unto Piety, and great Incentives un|to Vice: What hinders the good Seed from
<PB N="161" REF="89">
<HI>bringing Fruit unto perfection?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 8.14.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the Pleasures of Life,</HI> saith Christ. <HI>Whence comes wars and fightings among us?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">James 4.1.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>from your Pleasures,</HI> saith St. <HI>Iames.</HI> Why do you <HI>covet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ver.</HI> 3.</NOTE> and so <HI>zealously affect</HI> the World's good things? <HI>that you may,</HI> saith he, <HI>spend them, <GAP DESC="foreign">, in your Pleasures.</HI> What gave rise to the Corruptions of the Heathen World? even this, that they did, <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 3.3.</NOTE> <HI>serve divers Lusts and Pleasures.</HI> Is it not the pleasure we expect from the Enjoyment of the Creature, that gives the Rise to all that love and that desire of the Creature which you so tragically in|veigh against? And after all this, will you not only <HI>determine God's Operation</HI> to the production of the pleasure of all our sinful Actions, and oblige him <HI>by an immutable Law</HI> to reward our Transgressions with Pleasure and Delight, and immediately and solely to produce that in us which is so obstructive to Piety, so power|ful an incentive to that Sin he infinitely hates, and is the rise of all that Mischief which flows from the Love and Desire of the Creature; but also tells us, That God <HI>naturally delights in them, and wills them for themselves,</HI> that <HI>they are natural, genuine, and direct Effects of God,</HI> and that <HI>'tis of the proper Nature of God, as consisting of such essential Excellencies and Perfections</HI> to produce them? <HI>Credat Iudaeus Apella.</HI></P>
<P>And having thus impartially considered all that Mr. <HI>N.</HI> hath offer'd on this Subject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;. 9.</NOTE> I proceed next to the Discourses of the <HI>Good Lady</HI> on the same Subject; whose <HI>Rhetorick</HI> is
<PB N="162" REF="90">
very Charming, and her devout Affections highly commendable, but her Arguments sel|dom reach the point; and when they do, their strength is not equal to the Beauty of the Stile.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 144, 210.</NOTE>I grant unto her, that we are not <HI>to rest in the Creature as our end:</HI> For what we are to love only in due relation to our end, we can|not rest in as our end; That we are not <HI>to desire them as our Happiness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 179, 180, 181.</NOTE> or <HI>to look upon them as the completion of our Bliss</HI>; because we are to prize God only as the Object of our Bliss and Happiness: That we are not to <HI>lay the weight of our Souls upon them,</HI> or <HI>place our Feli|city in them:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 143.</NOTE> That we must not <HI>cleave to any Creature, or fix our Hearts upon it</HI>; for that is contrary to that superlative Affection to God, which requires us to part with all things, to cleave close unto him. That we must not suf|fer the Creature <HI>to usurp our hearts,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>to sit uppermost in our minds</HI>; for then we cannot love God above all things. Let her go on with her chast Rhetorick and Holy Flames, to beat down this inordinate Affection to the Creature; and we will equally admire, and approve her sayings. We accord with her, That the <HI>very best of Creatures are not able to sa|tisfie the Longings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 132.</NOTE> and <HI>fill the Capacities of our mind.</HI> Whence it will follow, that we must not place our Satisfaction, or the Content|ment of our mind in any Creature; which notwithstanding, if the Creature can supply our Wants, and be ordained by the Provi|dence of God to do so, we think it is the proper Object of our desire to have that want
<PB N="163" REF="90">
supplied.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 9. <HI>p.</HI> 185.</NOTE> <HI>We ought not to love the World,</HI> saith she, <HI>because of the danger of being conformed to it; for nothing is so excellent at imitation as Love, no|thing does so easily assimilate.</HI></P>
<P>Now doth she here mean the corrupt manners of the World? Her Proposition is invincible; but reaches not the point. If she means the good Things of the World, Food, Drink, Clothes, Houses, Lands, Orchards, Gold or Silver, I hope the danger of assimi|lation is not here very great. 'Tis granted, That <HI>the whole compass of desire must not be car|ried out after the Creature</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 195.</NOTE> for then I could not desire God above all, and before all things. So that my desire of Temporals when lawful, should be comparatively none; and when they hinder my desire of him, should be abso|lutely none.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 132.</NOTE> 'Tis therefore true, That <HI>the boundlesness of desire is a plain Indication, that it was never made for the Creature</HI> Only. But will it follow hence, that the Creature was not made for the Satisfaction of our natural Desires, or that our natural Appetites should not move to desire the Enjoyment of them? We grant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 208.209.</NOTE> That <HI>God</HI> (virtually) <HI>comprehends all possible Good, i. e.</HI> that he hath Virtue suffi|cient to produce it, and that he is the very Fountain and sole Author of it. But will the Love of God asswage her Hunger, quench her Thirst, or cloth her Nakedness? Or is he any other way the satisfier of our Desires of these things, than by affording us those Crea|tures he made on purpose for those ends? And must not then the hungry Appetite desire these Creatures for its Food, the thirsty for its Drink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But, saith the <HI>Good Lady,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="91"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Object.</HI></NOTE><HI>If we allow the Creature to be in any degree our Good,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Let.</HI> 5. <HI>p.</HI> 95.</NOTE> <HI>'tis hard to keep our selves from desiring it; and if we permit desire, we can never be secure from irregular Love; it being easier not to desire at all, then to desire with moderation.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE>It is not only hard, but it is sinful to keep our selves from desiring the Creature; it be|ing to keep our selves from desiring what God hath promised, and made the matter of our daily Prayer, and to rob our selves of all the Pleasure which ariseth from the <HI>Gratification of our natural Appetites or Desires according to,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lett.</HI> 7. <HI>p.</HI> 150.</NOTE> <HI>and not exceeding the Intention of Nature,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid. p.</HI> 149.</NOTE> and of all that <HI>grateful Relish or Sensation which every Fa|culty enjoys in the regular Application of it self to</HI> [i. e. in the desire of] <HI>such Octjects as are agreeable to its Nature</HI>; that is, of all the in|nocent Pleasures of our Lives.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor is it true, That <HI>it is easier not to de|sire at all, than to desire with moderation.</HI> For doubtless, this Excellent <HI>Lady</HI> desires rest and sleep when she doth want them, Food when she is hungry, and Drink when she is thirsty, and Health when she is sick, and desires all these things with moderation; but can she with more ease abstain from desiring them at all?</P>
<P N="3">3. Though we permit desire; yet if we do not permit it to exceed the real Necessities of Nature, and the bounds which <HI>Scripture</HI> hath set to it, and <HI>having Food and Raiment are there|with content:</HI> If we pursue the Comforts of this present Life, or the Gratifications of our na|tural Appetites <HI>according to, and so as not to ex|ceed the Intention of Nature</HI>; if we pursue them in relation to, and in due Submission to the
<PB N="165" REF="91">
Will of God; and only by those means, and in those measures he allows of, as Reason and <HI>Scripture</HI> do require, we cannot be immode|rate, and therefore not irregular in the desire of them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Our Hopes, our Fears, our Grief, De|light are subject to the like Irregularities; but must we therefore never permit these Passions to move towards their proper Objects? In fine, love of Benevolence toward our selves, our Friends, Relations, and our Life are too oft excessive, and are indeed the Root of that immoderate desire we have for the Creature; and yet they are commanded. It will not therefore follow, That we may not desire temporal good things at all, because these de|sires are subject to Irregularity.</P>
<P><HI>If we once permit our Desires to stray after the Creature,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Object.</HI> 2. <HI>P.</HI> 138.</NOTE> <HI>we open a Bank to all that Mischief, Malice, and Uncharitableness that is in the World.</HI></P>
<P>That is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE> if I pray; that is, desire of God my daily Bread; if I say to him with <HI>Agar, Feed me with Food convenient for one</HI>; if I ask of my <HI>Heavenly Father</HI> what he knoweth I have need of; if I desire to have what he hath promised, I open a Bank to all that Mischief, Malice and Uncharitableness that is in the World. This is strange Doctrine; yet the <HI>Good Lady</HI> thus attempts to prove it.</P>
<P><Q>For the Creature being finite and empty too,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> how is it possible, but that a multitude of Lovers who all desire the same thing,&mdash; should cross each other in these desires and pursuits, and consequently destroy that
<PB N="166" REF="92">
Peace and mutual Benevolence which ought to be cherished among rational Beings, and to which the Precepts of the Gospel so strictly engage us.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE>I have already granted that these Creatures are not desired to satisfie the Soul, but to sup|ply the Wants of the Body. Now is there any necessity in that fulness which the Earth affords for all, that I should desire what an|other hath; or that my desire of Meat, Drink and Clothing, which is all that Nature craves, and with which <HI>Christianity</HI> requires me to be content, should move me to cross the na|tural desires of others to have Meat, Drink and Clothes, when Providence hath made a plentiful provision of these things for us all? A desire thus limitted to <HI>contentment with Food and Raiment,</HI> lays a sure Fund for Charity to others, by disposing us to part with what is not thus necessary for our selves, to supply our Brother's Wants; which is all that Charity re|quires.</P>
<P><Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Object.</HI> 3.</NOTE>It is very unreasonable to love the Crea|ture, because it can never answer the end of Love. We desire only in order to Hap|piness; nothing being desirable any farther, than as it promotes that end: But the Love of the Creature is more apt to hinder, than advance our Happiness; and therefore in all Reason, Creatures are not to be thought desirable.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Answ.</HI></NOTE>I Answer, That we desire not only in order to our final Happiness, but also in order to the Gratification and Satisfaction of our Bo|dily
<PB N="167" REF="92">
Wants. For what we so far need, as that we are not able to live without it, we must desire, as much as we desire to subsist; tho' the desire of Life it self should be in order to God's Glory, and the Welfare of our Souls: And therefore in that sense even the desire of that Food by which we do sustain that Life, is a desire of it in order to our Happiness.</P>
<P N="2">2. To say this Generally, and without all Restriction, that the Love, that is, as she her self Interprets it, the desire of the Creature <HI>is more apt to hinder than advance our Happiness,</HI> is in effect to say that God himself doth move us to love and to obey him by the promise of things <HI>more apt to hinder than advance our Hap|piness</HI>; and that he hath Implanted in us na|tural Desires of such things; and that our Lord commands us daily to desire and pray for what rather tends to <HI>hinder than advance our Happiness.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, When the Lady saith, This is most certain,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 189.</NOTE> <HI>that what we love will be uppermost in our minds</HI>; I desire her to consider, that 'tis a contradiction to say, That what I love only in relation, and in Subordination to another, whom I do value above all things, should be uppermost in my Mind; that is, preferred in my Mind before that very Being my Mind doth value much above it.</P>
