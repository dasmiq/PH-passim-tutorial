<P>WEre Picques and Resentments kindled unto Charity, Prejudi|ces
of Education, and Wordly Designs laid aside, RELIGION
preferred to Interest, and the power of Godliness to that of Domi|nion;
then all the powers of Hell endued with the Pharisee him|self,
should never make <HI>Protestants</HI> of this <HI>Reformed Church</HI> of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
divide about matters of <HI>Ecclesiastick Government:</HI> It is clear to a
Demonstration, (such as the Nature of the thing requires) that
a <HI>President Episcopacy</HI> hath the <HI>Divine Institution,</HI> the <HI>Apostolick practice,</HI>
the <HI>Reception</HI> of the <HI>Primitive Church,</HI> and the <HI>Solemn Approbation</HI> of
a <HI>Revelation from Heaven:</HI> This <HI>Demonstration</HI> (from <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Beza</HI>
themselves) is the matter of this Essay; Which I cheerfully offer
to your censure and ingenuity; Adding, my Hearty Prayers, That,
<HI>Our Zion may at length be at unity within her self, serving one Lord, accord|ing
to one Rule, with one Heart, and Mouth, to the Glory of GOD, the joy of
Heaven, and all good Men upon Earth; The true happiness of the King and
People; The good contentment of our Brethren abroad; And the Melancholy
displeasure of the Adversary.</HI></P>
