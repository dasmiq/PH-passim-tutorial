The softned wax best takes the impression: therefore the Apostle placed this maine exhortation amongst his salutes, which gave that temper to their affections: tis a great matter to have a good opinion of the speakers love and inte|grity: therefore meekenesse and lenity, is the onely way to prevent, and retrench discords, there is place for rigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13.</NOTE> thats when lenity is impiously contemned: there are that carry not the sword in vaine: but our part is intreaty.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gregor.
