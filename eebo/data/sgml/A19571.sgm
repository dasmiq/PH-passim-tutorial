<HEAD>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_OVR SAVIOVR CHRIST</HI> Iesus, accordyng to the wil of his eternall father, when the tyme therto was fully co~|plished, taki~g our nature v|pon him, cam into this world frome the high throne of his Father, to declare vnto miserable sinners, good newes, to heale them that wer syck, to make the blind to see, the deaf to here, &amp; the domb to speke, to set prisoners at libertee, to shew that the tyme of grace &amp; mercy was come, to giue light to them that were in darknes and in the shadow of deth, and to preach and geue pardon and ful remission of sinne to al his elected. And to perfourme the same, he made a sacrifice &amp; oblation of his owne body vpon the crosse, whiche was a full redemp|tion, satisfaction, &amp; propitiation for the sinnes of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wholle world. And to co~mend this his sacrifice vnto al his faithful people, and to confirm their faith &amp; hope of eternall saluation in the same, he hath ordeined a perpetual memory of his said sa+crifice, daily to be vsed in the Church to his per|petual laud &amp; praise, &amp; to our singular comfort &amp; co~solation, That is to saie, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> celebration of his holy supper, wherin he doth not cesse to geue him selfe with al his benefites to all those that duely receiue the same supper, accordyng to his blessed ordinance. But the Romish Antichrist, to deface
<PB REF="3">
this great benefite of Christ, hath taught that his sacrifice vpon y^e crosse is not sufficient here|vnto, without another sacrifice deuised by him, and made by the priest, or els without Indulge~|ces, Beades, Pardons, Pylgramages, &amp; suche other pelfray, to supply Christes imperfection. And that christian people can not apply to them selfes the benefites of Christes passion, but that the same is in the distribution of the byshop of Rome, or els that by Christe we haue no full re|mission, but be deliuered onely from synne, and yet remayneth temporall payne in Purgatorye due for the same, to be remitted after this life by the Romishe Antichrist and his ministers, who take vpon them to do for vs, that thyng, whiche Christ either would not, or could not do. O hey|nous blasphemy and moste detestable iniury a|gainst Christe. O wicked abhominacion in the te~ple of God, O pryde intolerable of Antichrist, and most manifest token of the so~ne of pardicio~, extollyng him selfe aboue God, &amp; with Lucifer exaltyng his seate &amp; power aboue the throne of God. For he that taketh vpo~ him, to supply that thyng whiche he pretendeth to bee vnperfite in Christ, must nedes make him selfe aboue Christ, and so very Antichrist. For what is this els, but to be against Christ, &amp; to bryng him in co~tempt? as one y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> either for lacke of charitee would not, or for lacke of power he could not, with all his bloudsheadyng and death, clearely deliuer his faythfull, and geue them full remission of their

What ma~ of knowlege &amp; zeale to Gods honor, can with dry eyes se this iniury to Christ, and loke vpo~ the state of religion brought in by the Papistes, perceiuyng the true sence of Gods worde subuerted by false gloses of mans deui|syng, the true christian religion turned into cer|tayne hypocritical &amp; superstitious sectes, y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> peo|ple praiyng with their mouthes &amp; hearyng with theyr eares they wyst not what, &amp; so ignorant in Gods worde, that they could not discerne hypo|cricie &amp; superstition fro~ true &amp; syncere religion?

<P><PB REF="4">But what auaileth it to take away beades, par|do~s, pilgremages, and such other like Popery, so long as .ii. chief rootes remaine vnpulled vp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wherof so long as thei remain, wil spryng again al former impedime~tes of the Lordes haruest, &amp; corruption of his flock.

Which rootes if thei be suffred to grow in the Lords vineyard, thei wil ouerspreade all the ground agayn, with the old errours &amp; superstitions.

I knowe in what office god hath placed me, &amp; to what purpose, that is to say, to set forthe his word truly vnto his people, to the vttermost of my power, without respect of &abper;son, or regarde of thyng in the world, but of him alone.

I know how Antichriste hath obscured the glory of God, &amp; the true know+lege of his word, ouercastyng the same with my|stes and cloudes of errour and ignorance, tho|rough false gloses and interpretations. It piti|eth me to see the symple and hungrye flocke of Christ, ledde into corrupt pastures, to be caryed blyndfield, they know not whether, and to be fed with poyson in the stede of holsome meates.

<HEAD>THE FYRST BOKE IS OF THE TRVE AND CATHO|LIKE DOCTRINE AND VSE OF the sacrament of the body and bloud of our Sauiour Christe.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_THE SVPPER OF</HI> the Lorde, otherwise called The holy Com|munion or Sacrament of the body and bloode of our sauiour <HI>CHRI|STE,</HI> hathe beene of many men, and by son|dry wayes, very much abused, but speciallye within these fower or fiue hundreth yeares. Of some it hathe beene vsed as a sacrifice propici|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">torye for synne, and otherwise supersticiously, farre frome the intent that <HI>CHRIST</HI> dyd fyrst ordaine the same at the beginning, doing ther|in greate wronge and iniurye to his death and passion. And of other some it hath beene verye lyghtly esteemed, or rather contemned and di|spised, as a thynge of small or none effect. And thus betwene bothe the parties hath been mu|che variance and contention in diuers places of Christendome. Therefore to the intent that this holy sacrament or Lordes supper, may here after neither of the one partie bee contemned or
<PB REF="6">
lyghtly estemed, nor on the other partie be abu|sed to any other purpose, than Christe hym selfe dyd fyrste appoynte and ordeyne the same, and that so, the contention on bothe parties may be quieted and ended, the most sure and playn way is, to cleaue vnto holy scripture. Wherin what so euer is found, must be taken for a moste sure grounde and an infallible truthe, and what soe|uer can not bee grounded vpon the same (tou|chyng our faithe) is mans deuise, chaungeable and vncertayne. And therfore here are set forth the very wordes, that Christe hym selfe and his apostle saynt Paule spake, bothe of the eatyng and drynkyng of Christes body and bloud, and also of the eatyng and drynkynge of the sacra|ment of the same.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ea|tyng of the body of Christ.</NOTE><HI>FYRST</HI> as concernyng the eatyng of the bo+dy and drinkyng of the bloude of our sauyour Christe, he speaketh hym selfe in the .vi. chapi|ter of saynt Iohn in this wyse.</P>

Who so eateth my fleshe &amp; drin+keth my bloud, hath eternall lyfe, and I will rayse hym vp at the laste daye. For my fleshe is very meate, and my
<PB N="4" REF="6">
bloud is very drink. He that eateth my fleshe and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in hym. As the liuyng fa+ther hath sent me, and I liue by the fa|ther, euen so he that eateth me, shall lyue by me. This is the bread whiche came doune from heauen. Not as your fathers dyd eate Manna, and ar dead. He that eateth this breade, shall lyue for euer.</P>
<P>Of these wordes of Christe it is playne and manyfest,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augustin in Ioan Tra|ctat.</HI> 26.</NOTE> that the eatyng of Christes fleshe and drynkyng of his bloude, is not lyke to the ea|tyng and drynkyng of other meates and drin|kes. For although without meate and drynke man can not lyue, yet it foloweth not, that he that eateth and drynketh, shall lyue for euer. But as touchyng this meate and drynke of the body and bloude of Christe, it is true, bothe he that eateth and drinketh them, hath euerlasting life, and also he that eateth and drynketh them not,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eodent tract.</HI></NOTE> hath not euerlastynge life. For to eate that meate and drynke that drynke, is to dwell in Christe and to haue Christ dwellyng in him</P>
<P>And therfore no man can say or thynk,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aug. de Ci|uitate. Lib.</HI> 21. <HI>cap.</HI> 25.</NOTE> that he eateth the body of Christ or drinketh his bloud, excepte he dwelleth in Christe, and hath Christe

<P>Hytherto you haue heard all that the Euan|gelistes declare, that Christ spake or did at his last supper, concernyng the institucion of the Co~munion and sacrament of his body &amp; bloud.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 10.</NOTE>Is not the cup of blessynge, whyche we blesse, a comunion of the bloude of Christe? Is not the bread, whiche we breake, a communyon of the bodye of Christ? We beyng many, ar one bread and one body. For we all ar partakers of one bread and of one cuppe.</P>
<P>And in the eleuenth he speaketh on this maner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11.</NOTE>That whiche I deliuered vnto you,
<PB N="2" REF="8">
I receaued of the Lorde. For the lord Iesus, the same nyght, in the which he was betraied, toke breade, and whan he had geuen thankes, he brake it, and sayde: Take, eate, this is my bodye, whiche is broken for you. Doo this in remembrance of me. Likewise also he toke the cup, whan supper was doone, saiyng: This cuppe is the newe testa+ment in my bloude. Doo this as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as you shal eat this bread and drinke this cuppe, shew forthe the Lordes death tyll he come. Wherfore who so euer shall eate of this breade or drynke of this cuppe vnworthily, shall be gyltie of the body and bloude of the Lord. But let a man examine him self, and so eate of the bread, and drynke of the cuppe. For he that eateth and drin+keth vnworthily, eateth and drynketh his owne damnation, bycause he ma|keth no difference of the Lordes body. For this cause manny are weake and
<PB REF="9">
sycke among you, and many do sleape.</P>
<P>By these wordes of Christ rehersed of the E|uangelistes, and by the doctrine also of saynte Paule (whiche he confesseth that he receaued of Christe) two thynges specially are to be noted.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 4.</NOTE>Fyrst that our sauiour Christ called the ma|teriall bread whiche he brake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ cal|led the ma|teriall breade his body.</NOTE> his body, and the wyne (whyche was the fruite of the vyne) his bloud. And yet he spake not this, to the intente that men shulde thynke, that materiall bread is his very body, or that his very body is materi|all bread: neither that wyne made of grapes is his very bloud, or that his very bloud is wyne made of grapes, but to signifie vnto vs (as S. Paule saith) that the cuppe is a communion of Christes bloud that was shedde for vs, and the bread is a co~munion of his fleshe that was cru|cified for vs. So that although in the truth of his humane nature, Christe be in heauen, and sitteth on the ryghte hande of God the father, yet who so euer eateth of that bread in the sup|per of the Lorde, accordynge to Christes insti|tution and ordinaunce, is assured by Christes owne promyse and testament, that he is a mem|bre of his body, and receyueth the benefittes of his passion, whych he suffered for vs vpon the Crosse. And lykewise he that drynketh of that holly cuppe in that supper of the Lorde, accor|dynge to Christes institution, is certified by
<PB N="5" REF="9">
Christes legacie and testament, that he is mad partaker of the bloude of Christe, whyche was shed for vs.
And this ment saynte Paule, when he saith:<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 10.</NOTE> Is not the cuppe of blessyng which we blesse, a communion of the bloude of Christe? Is not the breade, whiche we breake, a commu|nion of the body of Christe?</Q>
So that no man can contemne or lyghtly esteme this holy com|munion, excepte he contemne also Christes bo|dy and bloud, and passe not whether he haue a|ny felowshyp wyth hym or no. And of those men saynte Paule saieth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11.</NOTE> that they eate and drynke their owne damnation, bycause they esteme not the body of Christe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<P>The seconde thyng whiche may bee lerned of the forsayd wordes of Christe and saynt Paule is this:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P><HI>Chap.</HI> 5.</P>
<P>Euill men do eate the sacrament but not the bodye of Christe</P></NOTE> that although none eateth the body of Christ, and drynketh his bloud, but they haue eternall lyfe, (as apereth by the wordes before recited of S. Iohn) yet both the good and the bad do eate and drynk the bread and wyne, whi+che be the Sacramentes of the same.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 6.</NOTE> But be|side the Scaramentes, the good eateth euerla|styng lyfe, the euyll euerlastyng death.
There|fore S. Paule saith:<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11:</NOTE> Whosoeuer shall eate of this breade, and drynketh of the cuppe of the Lorde vnworthyly, he <HI>shall be giltie</HI> of the body and bloudde of the Lorde.</Q>
Here sainte Paule saith not, that he that eateth the bread and drin+keth the cup of the Lorde vnworthyly, eateth and drynketh the body and bloud of the Lorde,
<PB REF="10">
but is giltie of the body and bloud of the Lord.
But what he eateth and drinketh S. Paule de|clareth, saiynge:<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Corin. 11.</NOTE> He that eateth and drynketh vnwoorthyly, eateth and drynketh his owne damnation.</Q></P>
<P>Thus is declared the summe of all that scri|pture speaketh of the eatyng and drynkynge, bothe of the body and bloud of Christ, and also of the sacrament of the same.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 6.</NOTE><HI>AND</HI> as these thynges be most certainly true, because they be spoken by Christe hym selfe, the author of all truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">These thi~|ges suffice for a chri|sten mans faith con|cerninge this sacra+ment.</NOTE> and by his holy apostle S. Paule, as he receaued them of Christ, so all do|ctrines contrary to the same, be moste certainly false and vntrue, and of all christian men to bee eschued, bycause they be contrary to gods word. And al doctrine concernyng this matter, that is more than this, whiche is not grounded vpon Goddes word, is of no necessitee, neither ought the peoples heades to be busied, or theyr consci|ences troubled with the same. So that thynges spoken and done by Christe, and written by the holy Euangelistes and S. Paule, ought to suf|fise the faith of christen people, as touching the doctrine of the Lordes supper, and holy commu+nion or sacrament of his body and bloud.</P>
<P>Whiche thynge beeyng well consydered and waied, shalbe a iust occasion to pacifie and agree bothe parties, as well them that hytherto haue contemned or lyghtly estemed it, as also theym whiche haue hitherto for lacke of knowledge or

<P>God graunt that al contention set aside, both the parties may come to this holy communion with suche a liuely faith in Christe, and such an vnfained loue to all Christes membres, that as they carnally eate with their mouth this sacra|mentall bread and drink the wine, so spiritually they maye eate and drynke the very fleshe and bloud of Christe whiche is in heauen, and sit|teth on the right hande of his father.

<P>And this earnest and greate desyre, is called in scripture,
The hunger and thirst of the soule: with whyche kynde of hunger Dauid was ta|ken, whan he sayde:<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal 41</NOTE> As an harte longeth for sprynges of water, so doth <HI>my soule long</HI> for the O God. <HI>My soule hath thyrsted</HI> after God, who is the well of lyfe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ps. 62.</NOTE> <HI>My soule thyrsteth</HI> for the, my fleshe wysheth for thee.</Q></P>
<P>And this hunger the sely poore synfull soule
<PB N="7" REF="11">
is dryuen vnto, by meanes of the lawe, whiche sheweth vnto her the horriblenes of synne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 4.</NOTE> the terrour of Goddes indignation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roma. 7.</NOTE> and the hor|rour of death and euerlastyng damnation.</P>
<P>And whan she seeth nothyng but damnation for her offences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 8.</NOTE> by iustice and accusation of the lawe, and this damnation is euer before her eies, than in this great distresse the soule beyng pressed with heuynesse &amp; sorowe, seketh for some comfort, and desireth some remedy for her mise|rable and sorowful estate. And this feelynge of her damnable condicion, and gredy desyre of re|freshyng, is the spirituall hunger of the soule.</P>
<P>And who soeuer hath this godly hunger, is blessed of God, and shal haue meate and drynke ynough, as Christ hym self said:<Q> Blessed be they that hunger and thirst for rightousnes, for they shalbe fylled ful.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 5.</NOTE></Q>And on thother side, they that see not their owne synfull and damnable estate, but thynke theim selues holy ynoughe, and in good case and condicion ynough, as they haue no spirituall hunger, so shall they not bee fed of God with any spirituall foode.
<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luc. 1.</NOTE> For as almigh|ty God feedeth them that be hungry, so doth he sende awaie empty all that be not hungry.</Q></P>
<P>But this hunger and thyrst is not easily per|ceyued of the carnall man. For when he hereth the holy ghoste speake of meate and drynk, his mynde is by and by in the kytchen and buttery, and he thynketh vpon his dyshes and pottes, his mouthe and his bealy.</P>
<P><PB REF="12">But the scripture in sundry places vseth spe|ciall wordes, wherby to drawe our grosse myn|des from the phantasyeng of our teeth and bel|ly, and from this carnall and fleshely imagina|tion.
For the Apostles and disciples of Christe, when they were yet carnall, knew not what was ment by this kynde of hunger and meate, and therfore when they desired hym to eate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 4.</NOTE> to with|drawe their myndes from carnall meate, he said vnto theim:<Q> I haue other meate to eate, whiche you knowe not.</Q>
And why knewe they it not? Forsothe because their myndes were grosse as yet, and had not receyued the fulnesse of the spi|rite. And therfore our sauiour Christ, myndyng to drawe them from this grossenes, tolde theim of an other kynd of meate, then they phantasied (as it were) rebukyng them, for that they percei+ued not, that there was any other kynde of ea|ting and drinkyng, besides that eatyng and drin+kyng, whiche is with the mouth and the throte.</P>
<P>Likewyse whan he sayd to the woman of Sa|maria:<Q> Who so euer shall drynke of that wa|ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iho. 4.</NOTE> that I shall geue hym, shall neuer be thirsty agayn.</Q>
They that heard hym speake those wor|des, might well perceyue, that he went about to make them wel acquaynted with an other kynd of drinkynge, than is the drynkynge with the mouth and throte. For there is no suche kynd of drynke, that with ones drynkyng, can quenche the thirst of a mans body for euer. Wherfore, in saiyng: He shall neuer be thirsty agayn. he dyd
<PB N="8" REF="12">
drawe theyr myndes from drynkynge with the mouth, vnto an other kind of drinkyng wherof they knew not, and vnto an other kynd of thir|sting, wherwith as yet thei wer not acquainted.</P>
<P>Also when our sauiour Christe saide:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 6.</NOTE>
<Q>He that commeth to me, shal nat hunger: and, He that be leueth on me, shall neuer bee thyrstye.</Q>
he gaue them a plaine watche worde, that there was an other kynd of meat and drinke, then that, wher|with he fedde them at the other syde of the wa|ter: and an other kynde of hungryng and thyr|stynge, then was the hungrynge and thirstyng of the body. By these wordes therfore he droue the people to vnderstand an other kynde of ea|tyng and drinkyng, of hungring and thyrstyng then that, whiche belongeth onely for the preser|uation of temporal lyfe.</P>
<P>Nowe then as the thyng that comforteth the body, is called Meate and drynke, of a lyke sor the scripture calleth the same thynge that com|forteth the soule, Meate and drynke.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<P>Wherfore as he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e before in the fyrste note is declared the hungre and drought of the soule,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cha.</HI> 10.</NOTE> so is it nowe secondly to bee noted, what is the meate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The spiri+tual foode of the soul</NOTE> drynke, and foode of the soule.</P>
<P>The meate, drynke, foode and refreshynge of the soule, is our sauiour Christe, as he sayd him selfe:<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 11.</NOTE> Come vnto me all you that trauayle and bee laden, and I will refreshe you. And, Yf any man be drye (saieth he) let hym come to me and drynke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 7.</NOTE> He that beleueth in me, flouddes of wa|ter
<PB REF="13">
of life shall flowe out of his bealy. And, I am the bread of life (sayth Christ) He that com|meth to me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 6.</NOTE> shal not be hungry: and he that be|leueth in me, shal neuer be dry.</Q></P>
<P>For as meate and drynke do comfort the hun+gry body, so doth the death of Christes body, &amp; the sheddyng of his bloud comforte the soule, when she is after her sort hungry. What thyng is it that comforteth &amp; norisheth the body? For|sooth meate and drynke. By what meanes than shall we call the body and bloud of our sauiour Christe (whiche doo comforte and nouryshe the hungrye soule) but by the names of meate and drynke?
And this similitude caused our sauiour to say:<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iho. 6.</NOTE> My fleshe is very meate, and my bloud is very drynke.</Q>
For there is no kynde of meate that is comfortable to the soule, but onely the death of Christes blessed body: nor no kynde of drynke, that can quenche her thyrst, but only the bloudsheddyng of our sauiour Christe, whiche was shed for her offences.</P>
<P>For as there is a carnall generation, and a carnal feedyng &amp; nourishement, so is there also a spiritual generation, and a spiritual feadyng.</P>
<P>And as euery ma~ by carnal generation of fa|ther and mother, is carnally begotten and born vnto this mortall lyfe, so is euery good christia~ spiritually borne by Christ vnto eternall life.</P>
<P>And as euery man is carnally fedde and nou|rished in his body by meate &amp; drynke, euen so is euery good christian man spiritually fedde and
<PB N="9" REF="13">
nourished in his soule by the fleshe and bloud of our sauiour Christ.</P>
<P>And as the body liueth by meate and drynke, and thereby increaseth and groweth fro~ a yong babe vnto a perfect man, (whiche thyng experi|ence teacheth vs) so the soule lyueth by Christe him selfe, by pure fayth eatyng his fleshe and drynkyng his bloud. And this Christ him selfe teacheth vs in the sixt of Ihon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 6.</NOTE> saiyng:
<Q>Uerely verely I say vnto you, excepte ye eate the fleshe of the sonne of man, and drynke his bloud, you haue no life in you. <HI>who so eateth my fleshe and drynketh my bloud, hath eternal life,</HI> and <HI>I wyl raise him vp at the last day</HI>: For <HI>my fleshe is very meate, and my bloud is very drynke.</HI> He that eateth my fleshe &amp; drynketh my bloud dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the liuyng father hath sent me, and I liue by the father, euen so <HI>he that eateth me, shal liue by me.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 2.</NOTE></Q>And this S. Paule confessed of him selfe, saiyng:
<Q> That I haue life, I haue it by fayth in the sonne of God. And nowe it is not I that liue, but Christ lyueth in me.</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<P>The third thyng to be noted is this,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap</HI> 11.</NOTE> that al|though our sauiour Christ resembleth his fleshe and bloud to meat &amp; drynke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> far excelleth all corpo|rall foode.</NOTE> yet he farre passeth and excelleth all corporall meates and drynkes. For although corporall meates and drynkes do norishe and continue our life here in this world, yet they begyn not our lyfe. For the beginnyng of our life we haue of our fathers and mothers, and the meate, after we be begotten, dothe feede
<PB REF="14">
and nourishe vs, and so preserueth vs for a time. But our sauiour Christ is bothe the first begin|ner of our spiritual lyfe, (who first begetteth vs vnto God his father) and also afterward he is our lyuely foode and nourishement</P>
<P>Moreouer, meate and drinke doth fede and no+rishe onely our bodies, but Christ is the true and perfect norishement, both of body and soule. And besides that, bodily food preserueth the lyfe but for a tyme, but Chrst is such a spirytual and per+fect foode, that he preserueth both body &amp; soule for euer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 11.</NOTE> As he said vnto Martha:
<Q>I am resurrec+tion and life. He that beleueth in me, although he dye, yet shall he lyue. And he that liueth and beleueth in me, shall not dye for euer.</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cha.</HI> 12.</NOTE>Fourthly it is to be noted, that the true know+lege of these thynges, is the true knowlege of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sacra+me~ts wer ordeyned to co~firme our faithe</NOTE> and to teache these thynges, is to teache Christe, and the beleuyng and feelyng of these thynges, is the beleuyng and felyng of Christe in our hartes. And the more clerely we see, vn|derstande and beleeue these thynges, the more clerely we se and vnderstande Christ, and haue more fully our faithe and comfort in hym.</P>
<P>And although our carnall generation &amp; oure carnall nourishement, be knowen to all men by dayly experience, and by oure common senses, yet this our spirituall generation and our spiri+tuall nutrition, be so obscure and hyd vnto vs, that we can not attayn to the true and perfecte knowledge and feelyng of theym, but onely by
<PB N="10" REF="14">
faith, whyche muste bee grounded vpon Gods moste holy worde and sacramentes.</P>
<P><HI>AND</HI> for this consideration our Sauioure Christe hath not onely sette forth these thynges moste playnly in his holy woorde, that we maie heare them with our eares, but he hath also or|deyned one visible sacrament of spiritual rege|neration in water, and an other visible sacra|ment of spiritual norishment in bread and wine to the intente, that as muche as is possible for man, we may se Christ with our eies, smell him at our nose, taste hym with our mouthes, grope hym with our handes, and perceue him with all our senses. For as the word of god preched, put+teth Christ into our eares, so likewyse these ele|ments of water, bread and wine, ioyned to gods word, do after a sacrame~tal maner, put Christ in to our eies, mouthes, handes and al our senses.</P>
<P>And for this cause Christ ordeyned baptisme in water, that as surely as we se, fele and touch water with our bodies, and be washed with wa+ter, so assuredly ought we to beleue, whan we be baptised, that Christ is veryly present with vs, and that by hym we bee newly borne agayn spiritually, and washed from our synnes, and grafted in the stocke of Christes own body, and be apparailed, clothed, and harnessed with hym, in suche wyse, that as the dyuel hath no power agaynst Christe, so hath he none against vs, so long as we remayne grafted in that stocke, and be clothed with that apparel and harnesed with
<PB REF="15">
that armour. So that the washyng in water of baptisme, is as it wer shewyng of Christ before our eyes, and a sensible touchyng, feelyng and gropyng of hym, to the confirmation of the in|warde faithe, whiche we haue in hym.</P>
<P>And in lyke maner Christ ordeined the sacra|ment of his body and bloud in bread and wine, to preach vnto vs, that as our bodies be fedde, nourished, and preserued with meate and drink, so (as touchynge our spirituall lyfe towardes God) we be fed, nourished and preserued by the body and bloud of our sauiour Christ, and also that he is such a preseruation vnto vs, that no|ther the deuils of hell, nor eternall deth, nor syn, can be able to preuaile against vs, so long as by true and co~stant faith, we be fed and nouryshed with that meate and drynke. And for this cause Christ ordeyned this sacrament in bread &amp; wine (whiche we eate and drynke, and be chiefe nutri+mentes of our body) to the intent, that as sure|ly as we see the breade and wine with our eies, smell theim with our noses, touche theym with our handes, and tast them with our mouths, so assuredly ought we to beleue, that Christ is our spirituall lyfe and sustinance of our soules, like as the sayd bread and wyne is the foode and su|stinaunce of our bodies. And no lesse ought we to doubt, that our soules bee fedde and lyue by Christe, then that our bodies be fed and lyue by meate and drinke. Thus oure sauiour Christe, knowing vs to be in this world (as it were) but
<PB N="11" REF="15">
babes and weakelynges in faith, hath ordeined sensible signes and toke~s, wherby to allure and drawe vs to more strengthe and more constaunt faith in hym. So that the eatyng and drinkyng of this sacramentall breade and wyne, is as it were a shewyng of Christ before our eies, a smel+lyng of hym with our noses, a feelyng and gro|pyng of hym with our handes, and an eatyng, chawyng, digestyng and feedyng vpon hym to our spirituall strength and perfection.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<P>Fyftly it is to be noted, that although there be many kyndes of meates and drynkes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 13.</NOTE> whych feede the body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wherfore this sacra+ment was ordeyned in breead and wyne</NOTE> yet our sauiour Chryst (as many) auncient authours write) ordeyned this sacra|ment of our spyrytual feedyng in bread &amp; wine, rather than in other meates &amp; drinkes, because that bread and wyne doo moste lyuely represent vnto vs the spiritual vnion and knot of al faith+full people, aswell vnto Christ, as also emonges them selfs. For lyke as bread is made of a great numbre of graynes of corne, grounde, baken, &amp; so ioyned together, that therof is made one lofe: And an infinite numbre of grapes be pressed to|gyther in one vessell, and therof is made wyne, likewyse is the whole multitude of true christia~ people spyrytually ioyned, fyrste to Christe, and then among them selues togyther, in one faith, one baptisme, one holy spyrite, one knotte and bonde of loue.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<P>Sixtely,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 14</NOTE> it is to bee noted, that as the breade and wyne whiche we do eate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vnite of Christs mysticall body</NOTE> be turned into our

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dionysius</HI></NOTE> And as one lofe is geuen amonge many men, so that euery one is partaker of the same lofe: and lykewyse one cup of wyne is distributed vnto many per|sons, wherof euery one is partaker, euen so our sauiour Christ (whose fleshe and bloud be repre|sented by the mystical bread and wine in the lor|des supper) doeth geue hym selfe vnto all his true membres, spiritually to fede them, noryshe them, and to geue them continuall lyfe by hym. And as the braunches of a tree, or membre of a body, if they be dead or cut of, they neyther lyue, nor receiue any nourishement or sustinaunce of the body or tree, so lykewyse vngodly &amp; wycked people, (which be cut of from Christes misticall body, or be dead membres of the same) doo not spiritually fede vpon Christs body &amp; bloud, nor haue any lyfe, strength or sustentation therby.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 15</NOTE>Seuenthly it is to be noted, that where as no thynge in this lyfe is more acceptable beefore God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Sa+cramente moueth al me~ to loue and frend+shyp</NOTE> or more pleasaunt vnto man, than christen people to lyue togither quietly in loue &amp; peace,

vnitee and concorde: this sacrament doth most aptly and effectuously moue vs thervnto. For when we bee made all partakers of this one ta|ble, what ought we to thynke, but that we be al membres of one spiritual body? (wherof Christ is the head) that we bee ioyned together in one Christ, as a great numbre of graines of corne be ioyned together in one loofe? Surely they haue very harde and stony heartes, whiche with these thinges be not moued. And more cruel &amp; vnrea|sonable be they then brute beastes, that can not be persuaded, to bee good to their christian bre|thren and neighbours (for whom Christ suffred death) when in this sacrament they be put in re|membraunce, that the sonne of God bestowed his life for his enemies. For we see by dayly ex|perience, that eatyng and drynkyng together, maketh frendes, and contynueth frendshippe. Muche more than ought the table of Christ to moue vs so to do. Wylde beastes and byrdes bee made gentle by geuyng them meate and drynke, why then should not christen men waxe meeke and gentle with this heauenly meate of Christe? Herevnto wee bee stirred and moued as well by the bread and wyne in this holy sup|per, as by the woordes of holy scripture recited in the same. Wherfore whose heart soeuer this holy Sacrament, Communion and supper of Christ, wil not kindle with loue vnto his neigh|bours, and cause him to put out of his heart all enuye, hatred and malice, and to graue in the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The doc|trine of tra~substa~|tiation do+eth cleane subuerte our faythe in Christe</NOTE>But all these forsayd godly admonitions, ex|hortations and comfortes, doo the Papistes (as muche as lyeth in them) take away from al chri|sten people, by their transubstantiation.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 16.</NOTE>The eyght thyng that is to bee noted is, that this spirituall meate of Christ is body and blud, is not receaued in the mouthe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The spiri|tual etyng is with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he harte, not with the teethe.</NOTE> and digested in the stomacke (as corporall meates and drynkes
<PB N="13" REF="17">
commonly bee) but it is receaued with a pure harte, and a sincere faithe. And the trewe ea|tyng and drinking of the sayd body and bloude of Christ, ys wyth a constant and a lyuely faith to beeleue, that Chryste gaue hys bodye, and shedde hys bloude vppon the Crosse for vs, and that he doeth so ioyne and incorporate himselfe to vs, that hee is our heade, and wee his mem|br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and fleshe of his fleshe, and bone of his bones, hauinge hym dwellynge in vs, and wee in hym. And herein standeth the whole effecte and strength of this sacrament. And this faith God woorketh in wardely in our hartes by hys holy spirite, and confyrmeth the same outward|ly to our eares, by hearinge of hys woorde: and to our other senses, by eatynge and drynkynge of the sacramentall breade and wyne in hys ho|ly supper.</P>
<P>What thynge then can be more comfortable to vs, than to eate thys meate and drynke thys drynke? Wherby Christ certyfyeth vs, that we bee spirytually and trewely fedde and noury|shed by hym, and that wee dwell in hym, and he in vs.
Canne this bee shewed vnto vs more playnly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 6.</NOTE> than whan he saith hym selfe:<Q> He that eateth me, shall lyue by me?</Q></P>
<P>Wherfore whosoeuer doth not contemne the euerlasting lyfe, how can he but highely esteme this sacrament: How can he but imbrace it, as a sure pledge of his saluacion? And whan hee seeth godly people deuoutly receaue the same,

howe can he but be desyrous oftentymes to re|ceiue it with them? Surely no man that wel vn+derstandeth, and diligently wayeth these things can bee without a greate desire to come to thys holy supper.</P>
<P>All men desyre to haue goddes fauoure, and when they knowe the contrary, that they be in his indignacion, and caste out of his fauoure, what thinge can comforte them? Nowe be theyr myndes vexed? What trouble is in their consci+ences? All goddes creatures seme to be against them, and do make theym afraide, as thinges being ministers of goddes wrath and indignaci+on towards them. And rest and comfort ca~ they finde none, neither within them, not withoute them.

<P>And in this sorowful heauines, holy scripture teacheth theim, that our heauenly father can by no meanes be pleased with theim againe, but by the sacrifice and deathe of his only begot|ten sonne, whereby God hathe made a perpe|tuall amitee and peace with vs, doth pardon the sinnes of them that beleue in him, maketh theim his chyldren, &amp; giueth them to his first begotten son Christe, to be incorporate into him, to be sa|ued by him, and to be made heires of heuen with him.

this his deathe, and of the whole mysterye of our redemption. In the which supper is made mention of his testamente, and of the afore|sayde Communion of vs with Christe, and of the remission of oure sinnes by his sacrifice vp|pon the crosse.</P>
<P>Wherefore in this sacrament (yf it be rightly receaued with a true faithe) we bee assured that our sinnes bee forgiuen, and the leage of peace and the testament of God is confirmed betwene hym and vs, so that who so euer by a true faithe doth eate Christes flesh, and drinke his bludde, hath euerlastinge lyfe by hym.

And althoughe there be the colour of bread &amp; wyne, the sauour, the smell, the bygnes, the fashion, and all other (as they call them) accidentes, or qualities and
<PB N="15" REF="19">
qua~tities of bread and wyne, yet (say they) there is no very bread nor wyne, but they bee turned into the fleshe &amp; bloud of Christ. And this co~uer|sion they call Transubstantion, that is to say, turnyng of one substa~ce into another substa~ce. And although all the accidentes, bothe of the bread and wyne, remayne styl, yet (say they) the same accidentes, be in no maner of thyng, but hang alone in the ayre, without any thyng to stay them vpon. For in the body and bloud of Christ (say they) these accidentes can not be, nor yet in the ayre, for the body and bloud of Christ and the ayre, be neither of that bignes, fashion, smell, nor colour, that they bread and wyne be. Nor in the bread and wyne (say they) these acci|dentes can not be, for the substa~ce of bread and wyne (as they affirme) be cleane gone. And so there remaineth whitnes, but nothing is white: there remayneth colours, but nothing is colou|red therwith: there remaineth roundnes, but no thyng is round: and there is bygnes, and yet no thyng is bygge: there is swetenes, without any swete thyng: softnes, without any soft thyng: breakyng, without any thyng broken: diuision, without any thyng deuided: and so other quali|ties &amp; quantities, witout any thyng to receyue them. And this doctrin they teache as a necessa|ry article of our fayth.</P>

<PB REF="20">
furth by schole authors, whose studye was euer to defende and set abrode to the worlde all suche matters, as y^e byshop of Rome had once decreed. And the deuil by his minister Antichrist, had so daseled the eyes of a great multitude of christen people in these latter dayes, that they sought not for their fayth, at the cleare light of Gods worde, but at the Romishe Antichrist, beleuyng whatsoeuer he prescribed vnto the~, yea though it were against all reason, all senses, and Gods most holy worde also. For els he could not haue been very Antichrist in dede, except he had been so repugnaunt vnto Christe, whose doctrine is cleane contrary to this doctrine of Antichrist. For Christ teacheth, that we receiue very bread and wyne in the most blessed supper of the Lord as sacramentes to admonishe vs, that as we be fedde with bread &amp; wyne bodely, so wee be fedde with the body and bloud of our sauiour Christ spiritually. As in our baptisme we receiue very water, to signifye vnto vs, that as water is an element to washe the body outwardly, so be our soules washed by the holy ghost inwardly.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The seco~d is of the prese~ce of Christ in this sacra|ment.</NOTE>The seconde principall thyng, wherein the Papistes varry from the truth of Gods worde, is this. They say, that the very natural fleshe and bloud of Christe, whiche suffered for vs vpon the crosse, and sitteth at the right hand of the father in heauen, is also really, substancial|ly, corporally, and naturally, in or vnder the accidentes of the sacramental bread and wyne,
<PB N="16" REF="20">
which they cal, the fourmes of bread and wyne. And yet here they varry not a lytle among them selues. For some say, that the very natural bo|dy of Christ is there, but not naturally, nor sen|sibly. And other saye, that it is there naturally and sensibly, and of the same bygnes &amp; fashion that it is in heauen, and as the same was borne of the blessed virgyn Mary, and that it is there broken and torne in peeces with our teethe. And this appeareth partly by the schole authors, and partly by the confession of Beringarius,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De consecra+ti. Distin.</HI> 2. <HI>Ego Berin|garius.</HI></NOTE> whiche Nicholaus the second constrayned him to make, whiche was this. That of the sacra|mentes of the Lordes table the sayd Beringa|rius should promise to holde that fayth, whiche the sayd Pope Nicholas and his counsail held, whiche was, that not onely the sacramentes of bread and wyne, but also the very fleshe and bloud of oure Lorde Iesu Christ, are sensibly handeled of the priest in the altare, broken and torne with the teethe of the faythfull people.
But the true catholike fayth, grounded vpon Gods moste infallible woorde, teacheth vs, that our sauiour Christ (as concernyng his mannes nature and bodely presence) is gone vp vnto heauen, &amp; sitteth at the right hand of his father, and there shall he tarry vntyl the worldes ende, at what tyme he shal come agayn, to iudge both the quicke and the dead, as he sayth him selfe in many scriptures.<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioan. 6.</NOTE> I forsake the worlde (sayth he) and go to my Father.

he sayth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 26</NOTE> You shal haue euer poore men among you, but me you shall not euer haue. And again he sayth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 24</NOTE> Many hereafter shall come and laye: Loke here is Christe, or looke there he is, but beloue them not. And sainct Peter sayth in the Actes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 3.</NOTE> that heauen must receiue Christe, vntyll the tyme that all thynges shall be restored.</Q>And saint Paule writyng to the Colossians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colos. 3</NOTE> agreeth hereto, saiyng:
<Q> Seke for thinges that be aboue, where Christ is sittyng at the right hand of the father.</Q>
And sainct Paule speakyng of the very sacrament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 11</NOTE> sayth:<Q> As often as you shall eate this bread, and drynke this cuppe, shewe furth the Lordes death vntyll he come.</Q>
Tyll he come sayth S. Paule, signifiyng, that he is not there corporally present. For what speeche were this or who vseth of him that is already present, to say, Untyl he come? For Untyl I come, signify|eth that he is not yet present. This is the catho|like fayth, whiche we learne from our youth in our common Crede, and whiche Christ taught, the Apostles folowed, and the martyres confir|med with theyr bloud.</P>
<P>And although Christ in his humayne nature substantially, really, corporally, naturally and sensibly, be present with his father in heaue~, yet sacramentally and spiritually he is here present in water bread and wyne, as in signes and sa|cramentes, but he is in deede spiritually in the faythfull christian people, whiche accordyng to Christes ordinaunce be baptised, or receyue the
<PB N="17" REF="21">
holye communion, or vnfainedly beleue in him. Thus haue you hard the seconde pryncipal ar|ticle, wherin the Papistes vary from the truthe of Goddes worde, and from the catholike faith.</P>
<P>Nowe the thyrde thynge, wherin they varye, is this.</P>
<P>The Papistes saye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The thyrd is that euil men eate &amp; drinke the very bodye and bloode of Christ.</NOTE> that euell and vngodlye men receaue in this sacramente the very bodye and bloud of Christe, and eate and drynke the selfe same thinge, that the good and godly men doo. But the truthe of Gods woorde is contra|ry, that al those that be godly me~bres of Christe, as they corporally eate the bread and drinke the wyne, so spiritually they eate and drinke Chri|stes very fleshe and bloude. And as for the wyc|ked membres of the dyuell, they eate the sacra|mental bread, and drinke the sacramental wyne, but they doo not spiritually eate Christs fleshe nor drinke his blode, but they eate and drinke theyr owne damnation.</P>
<P>The fourthe thynge, wherein the Popyshe preestes dissente frome the manifest woorde of God, is this. They saie, that they offre Christe euery day for remission of sinne, and distribute by their Masses, the merites of Christes passi|on. But the prophetes, apostels and euangeli|stes doo saye, that Christe him selfe in his owne person made a sacrifice for our sinnes vppon the Crosse, by whose woundes all our diseases were healed, and our sinnes pardoned, and so dyd neuer no preest, man, nor creature but he, nor he

For (say they) as soone as these woordes be fully ended, there is no breade lefte, nor none other substaunce, but onlye Christes bodye. Whan Christe saide (<HI>this,</HI>) the breade (saye they) remayned. And whan he sayde (<HI>is</HI>) yet the breade remained. Also whan hee added (<HI>my</HI>) the breade remained styll.

But this negatiue, that there is no breade, they make of their owne braynes, by theyr Unwrytten verities.</P>
<P>Oh good lord, howe wold they haue bragged if Christ had sayd: This is no bread. But Christ spake not that negatiue, This is no bread, but said affirmingly, This is my body. not denying the bread, but affirming that his body was eate~,
<PB REF="23">
(meaning spiritually) as the breade was eaten corporally.</P>
<P>And that this was the meaning of Christ, ap+peareth plainly by S Paule, in the tenth chap. to the Corinth.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Cor. 10.</NOTE>
the fyrste epistle, where he (spea|kinge of the same matter) saithe:<Q> Is not the breade whiche wee breake, <HI>the communion of the body of Christe</HI>?</Q>
Who vnderstode the mynde of Christ better than S. Paule, to whom Christe shewed his moste secrete counsailes? And saint Paule is not afraide, for our better vnderstan|dinge of Christes wordes, somewhat to alter the same, least we might stande stiffely in the letters and syllables, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rre in mistaking of Christes wordes. For where as our sauiour Christ brake the bread and said, This is my body: S. Paule saith, that the bread which we breake, is the com+munion of Christes body. Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid, his body: and saint Paule said, the co~munion of his body: meaning neuertheles both one thinge, that thei which eate the breade worthely, do eate spiritu|ally Christes very body. And so Christe calleth the bread his body (as the olde authors report) bicause it representeth his body, and signifieth vnto them whiche eate that bread according to Christes ordinance, that they do spiritually eate his bodye, and be spiritually fed and nourished by him, and yet the breade remaineth still there as a sacrament to signifie the same. But of these words of Consecration shal be spoken hereafter more at large.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="23">Therfore to returne to the purpose, that the bread remayneth, and is eaten in this sacrame~t, appeareth by the woordes whiche go before the consecration.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 26,</NOTE>
<Q>For that Christ <HI>tooke bread, and brake it, and gaue it to his disciples, and sayd: Take, eate.</HI></Q>
All this was done and spoken before the woordes of consecracion. Wherfore they must nedes be vnderstand of y^e very bread, that Christ toke bread, brake bread, gaue bread to his disci|ples, co~maundyng them to take bread, and eate bread. But the same is more plaine and euident of the wyne, that it remayneth, and is dronken at the Lordes supper, aswell by the wordes that go before, as by the woordes that folowe after the consecracion.
For before the wordes of con|secracion, Christe tooke the cuppe of wyne, and gaue it vnto his disciples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 26. Mat. 14,</NOTE> and sayd:<Q> Drynk you all <HI>of this.</HI> And after the wordes of consecracion foloweth, They dranke all <HI>of yt.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Nowe I aske all the Papistes, what thyng it was that Christ commaunded his disciples to drynke, whan he sayd, Drynke you all of this? The bloud of Christ was not yet there, by their owne confession, for it was spoken before the co~|secracion: Therfore it could be nothyng els but wyne that he commaunded them to drynke.</P>
<P>Then I aske the Papistes ones againe, whe|ther the disciples dranke wyne or not? If they say, yea, then let them recant their errour, that there was no wyne remainyng after the co~secra|cion. If they say nay, then they condempne the
<PB REF="24">
Apostles of disobedience to Christes commaun+dement, whiche dranke not wyne as he co~maun+ded them. Or rather they reproue Christ as a Iuggler, which commaunded his Apostles to drynke wyne, and whan they came to the dryn|kyng therof, he him selfe had conuayed it away.</P>
<P>Moreouer, before Christ deliuered the cuppe of wyne to his disciples, he sayd vnto them: <HI>De|uide</HI> this among you.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luc. 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>Here would I aske the Papistes another que|stion, what thyng it was that Christ commaun|ded his disciples to deuide among them? I am sure they wyll not saye, it was the cuppe, ex|cept they bee disposed to make menne laugh at them. Nor I thynke they wyll not say, it was the bloud of Christ, aswell because the woordes were spoken before the consecration, as because the bloud of Christ is not deuided, but spiritu|ally geuen whole in the sacrament. Than could it be vnderstande of nothyng elles but of wyne, whiche they should deuide among them, and drynke all together.</P>
<P>Also when the Co~munion was ended, Christ sayd vnto his Apostles.
<Q>Uerely I say vnto you, that I wyll drynke no more hencefurth of <HI>this fruite of the vyne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 26. Mar. 14.</NOTE> vntyl y^e day, that I shal drynke it newe with you, in my fathers kyngdome.</Q></P>
<P>By these wordes it is cleare, that it was very wyne that the Apostles dra~ke at that godly sup|per. For the bloud of Christ is not y^e fruite of the vyne, nor the accide~tes of wyne, nor none other
<PB N="20" REF="24">
thing is y^e fruit of the vine, but very wyne only.</P>
<P>Howe could Christ haue expressed more plain+ly, that bread &amp; wyne remayne, than by takyng the breade in his handes, and breakyng it him selfe, and geuyng it vnto his disciples, comaun|dyng them to eate it? And by takyng the cuppe of wyne in his handes, and deliueryng it vnto them, commaundyng them to deuide it among them, &amp; to drynke it, &amp; callyng it the fruit of the vyne? These wordes of Christ be so playn, that if an Angel of heaue~ would tel vs the contrary, he ought not to be beleued. And than much lesse may we beleue the subtyl liyng of the Papistes.</P>
<P>If Christ would haue had vs to beleue (as a necessary article of our fayth) that there remay|neth neither bread nor wyne, would he haue spoken after this sorte, vsyng all suche termes and circumstaunces as should make vs beleue, that styl there remayneth bread &amp; wyne? What maner of teacher make thei of Christ, that say, he ment one thyng, when his wordes be cleane con+trary? What christian heart can paciently suffre this contumely of Christ?</P>
<P>But what crafty teachers be these Papistes, who deuise phantasies of their owne heades, di|rectly contrary to Christes teachyng, and than sette the same abrode to christen people, to bee moste assuredly beleued as Goddes owne moste holy worde? Sainct Paule did not so, but folo|wed herein the maner of Christes speakyng, in callyng of bread, bread, and wyne, wyne, and
<PB REF="25">
neuer alteryng Christes woordes herein.
<Q>The <HI>bread</HI> whiche wee breake (sayth he) is it not the communion of Christes body?<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Co. 10</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Nowe I aske agayn of the Papists, whether he spake this of the bread consecrated or not co~|secrated? Thei can not say that he spake it of the bread vnconsecrated, for that is not the commu|nion of Christes body by their owne doctrine. And if S. Paule spake it of bread consecrated, than they must needes confesse, that after conse|cracion suche bread remayneth, as is broken bread, whiche can bee none other than very true material bread.
And straight wayes after sainct Paule sayth in the same place,<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Co. 10</NOTE> that wee be par|takers of one bread and one cuppe.</Q>
And in the next chapiter, speakyng more fully of the same matter, four tymes he nameth the bread and the cuppe, neuer makyng mention of any transub|stantiation, or remainyng of accide~tes without any substaunce, whiche thynges he would haue made some mencion of, if it had been a necessary article of our fayth, to beleue that there remay|neth no bread nor wyne. Thus it is euident and plaine, by the wordes of scripture, that after co~|secracion remayneth bread and wyne, and that the Papisticall doctrine of transubstantiation, is directly contrary to Gods worde.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 3. The Pa|pistical doctrin is against reason.</NOTE>Let vs nowe consider also, howe the same is against natural reason and natural operacion, which although thei preuaile not against Gods woorde, yet whan they bee ioyned with Gods
<PB REF="25">
worde, they be of great moment to confirme a|ny truthe. Naturall reason abhorreth <HI>vacuum,</HI> that is to saie, that there shoulde be any empty place, wherin no substance shoulde be. But yf ther remain no bread nor wine, the place where they wer before, and where theyr accidentes be, is fylled with no substance, but remaineth <HI>va|cuum,</HI> cleane contrary to the order of nature.</P>
<P>We se also that the wyne, though it be conse|crated, yet wyll it tourne to vyneger, and the breadde wyll mowle, whyche than be nothynge elles but sowre wyne and mowled bread, which could not waxe sowre nor mowly, if there were no breade nor wyne there at all.</P>
<P>And if the sacramentes were nowe brent (as in the olde church they bourned all that remai|ned vneaten) lette the Papistes telle what is brente. They must needes saie, that it is eyther bread, or the body of Christe. But breade (saye they) is none there. Than muste they needes bourne the body of Christ, and be called Christ|bourners (as heretofore they haue burned ma|ny of his membres) except they wil say, that ac|cidentes bourne alone without any substaunce, contrary to all the course of nature.</P>
<P>The sacramentall breade and wyne also wyll nourishe, whiche nourishement naturally com|meth of the substance of the meates and dryn|kes, and not of the accidentes.</P>
<P>The wyne also wyll poyson, (as dyuers by|shops of Rome haue had experiences, bothe in
<PB REF="26">
poysonyng of other, and beyng poysoned them selues) whiche poysonyng they can not ascribe to the moste holsome bloud of our sauior Christ, but onely to the poysoned wyne.</P>
<P>And most of all, it is against the nature of ac+cidentes, to be in nothing. For the definition of accidentes, is to be in some substance, so that if they be, they must nedes be in some thyng. And yf they be in nothynge, than they bee not.</P>
<P>And a thousand thynges mo, of lyke foolish|nesse doo the Papistes affirme by their Tran|substantiation, contrary to all nature and rea|son. As that two bodies bee in one place, and one body in many places at one tyme, and that substances be gendred of accidentes onely, and accidentes conuerted into substances, and a bo|dy to be in a place, and occupie no roume, and generation to be without corruption, and cor|ruption without generation, with many suche lyke thynges, agaynst all order and principles of nature and reason.</P>

<P>Our faithe teacheth vs to beleeue thynges that we see not, but it doth not byd vs, that wee shall not beleue that we see dayly with our eies, and heare with our eares, and grope with our handes. For although our senses can not reache so farre as our faithe doothe, yet so farre as the compas of our senses doeth vsually reache, our faith is not contrary to the same, but rather our senses doo confirme our faith. Or els what auai+led it to S. Thomas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 20.</NOTE> for the confirmation of Christes resurrectio~, that he did put his hand in to Christs side, &amp; felte his woundes, if he might not trust his senses, nor giue no credit therto?</P>
<P>And what a wyde doore is here opened to Ua+lentinianus, Marcion, and other heretikes, whi+che sayde that Christe was not crucified, but that Symon Cyreneus was crucifyed for him, although to the syghte of the people, it seemed that Christe was crucified? Or to suche hereti|kes as sayde, that Christ was no man, although to mens sightes he appered in the forme of man and semed to be hu~gry, dry, weery, to wepe, slepe, eate, drynke, yea and to dye lyke as other men doo? For if we ones admyt this doctrine, that no credite is to be geuen to our senses, we open a large field, &amp; geue a great occasio~ vnto an innu+merable rablement of most heinous heresies.</P>
<P>And if there be no trust to be geuen to our sen|ses
<PB REF="27">
in this matter of the sacramente, why than do the Papistes so stoutely affirme, that the ac|cidentes remayn after the consecration? whiche can not be iudged but by the senses. For the scri+pture speaketh no woorde of the accidentes of breade and wyne, but of the breade and wyne them selues. And it is againste the nature and diffinition of accidentes, to bee alone withoute any substance. Wherefore if we may not truste our senses in this matter of the sacrament, tha~ if the substance of the bread and wyne be gone, why may we not then say, that the accidentes be+gon also? And if we must nedes beleue our sen|ses, as co~cernyng the accidents of bread &amp; wine, why may we not do the lyke of the substance, &amp; that rather than of the accidentes? Forasmuche as after the co~secration the scripture saith in no place, that there is no substance of bread nor of wyne, but calleth them still by suche names as signifie the substances, and not the accidentes?</P>
<P>And fynally, if our senses be dayly deceiued in this matter, tha~ is the sensible sacrament no|thyng els, but an elusion of our senses. And so we make muche for their purpose, that said that Christ was a crafty iuggler, that made thinges to appere to mens sightes, that in dede were no suche thynges, but formes onely, figures, and apparances of them.</P>
<P>But to conclude in fewe wordes this processe of our senses, let al the Papistes lay their hea|des togither, and thei shal neuer be able to shew

<P>Fyrst Iustinus a great learned man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iustinus.</HI></NOTE> and an holy martyr, the oldest author that this day is knowen to write any treatie vpon the sacramen+tes, and wrote not muche aboue one hundred yeres after Christes ascension.</P>
<P><Q>He wryteth in his seconde apologie, that the bread, water, and wine in this sacrament, ar not to be taken as other co~mon meates and drinkes be, but they bee meates ordeyned purposely to geue thankes to god, and therfore be called <HI>Eu|charistia,</HI> and be called also the body and bloude of Christ.

<P>By which saiyng it is euident, that Iustinus thought, that the bread and wine remained still
<PB REF="28">
for els it could not haue been tourned into our fleshe and bloud, to nourishe our bodies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Irenaeus con|tra Valenti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">um. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE>Next hym was Ireneus, aboue. 150. yeres af|ter Christ, who (as it is supposed) could not be deceiued in the necessary pointes of our faithe, for he was a disciple of Polycarpus, which was disciple to saint Iohn the Euangelist.
This I|reneus foloweth the sense of Iustinus wholly in this matter, and almoste also his woordes, sayenge,<Q> that the bread, wherein we geue than|kes vnto God, although it be <HI>of the yearth,</HI> yet whan the name of God is called vpon it, it is not than common bread, but the bread of than|kes geuyng, hauyng two thyngs in it, <HI>one earth+ly,</HI> and the other heuenly.</Q>
What ment he by the heauenly thyng, but the sanctification whyche cometh by the inuocation of the name of God? And what by the earthly thynge? but the very bread, which (as he sayd before) is of the earth? and which also (he saith) doeth nourishe our bo|dies, as other bread dothe whiche we doo vse?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Origenes in Mat. ca.</HI> 15.</NOTE>Shortely after Ireneus was Origen about 200. yeares after Christes ascension.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cyprian. ad Ceciliu~ li.</HI> 2. <HI>epistola.</HI> 3.</NOTE>After Origen came Cyprian the holy martyr about the yeare of our Lorde 250. who wryteth against theym that ministred this Sacrament
<PB N="24" REF="28">
with water onely, and without wyne.
<Q>For as muche (sayth he) as Christ sayd, I am a true vyne. therefore <HI>the bloud of Christ is not water, but wyne,</HI> nor <HI>it can not bee thouhgt that his bloud</HI> (wherby wee bee redemed and haue life) <HI>is in the cuppe, whan wyne is not in the cuppe, whereby the bloud of Christ is shewed.</HI></Q></P>
<P>What woordes could Cyprian haue spoken more plainly, to shewe that the wyne doth re|mayne, than to say thus: If there bee no wyne, there is no bloud of Christ?</P>
<P>And yet he speaketh shortly after, as plainely in the same Epistle.<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.</NOTE> Christ (sayth he) takyng the cuppe, blessed it, and gaue it to his disciples, saiyng: Drynke you all of this, for this is the bloud of the newe testament, whiche shall bee shedde for many, for the remission of synnes. I say vnto you, that from hencefurth I wyll not drynke of <HI>this creature of the vyne,</HI> vntyll I shall drinke with you newe wyne in the kyngdome of my father. By these woordes of Christe (sayth sainct Cyprian) we perceiue, that the cuppe whi|che the Lorde offered, was not onely water, but also wyne. And that <HI>it was wyne, that Christ cal|led his bloud,</HI> whereby it is cleare, that <HI>Christes bloud is not offered, if there be no wyne in the Cha|lise.</HI> And after it foloweth: Howe shal we drynke with Christ newe <HI>wyne of the creature of the vyne,</HI> if in the sacrifice of God the father and of Christ we do not <HI>offre wyne</HI>?</Q></P>
<P>In these wordes of sainct Cyprian, appereth
<PB REF="29">
moste manyfestly, that in this sacrament is not only offered very wyne, that is made of grapes, that come of the vyne, but also that we drynke the same. And yet the same geueth vs to vnder|stand, that if we drynke that wyne worthely, we drynke also spiritually the very bloud of Christ, whiche was shed for our synnes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eusebius Emissenus.</HI></NOTE>Eusebius Emissenus, a ma~ of syngular fame in learnyng, about CCC. yeres after Christes ascention, did in fewe wordes set out this matter so plainely, (bothe howe the bread and wyne be conuerted into the body &amp; bloud of Christ, and yet remayne styll in their nature, and also howe besydes the outwarde receiuyng of bread and wyne, Christ is inwardely by fayth receyued in our heartes) al this (I say) he doth so plainly set out, that more playnnesse can not be reasonably desyred in this matter. For he sayth, that the co~|uersion of the visible creatures of bread &amp; wyne, into the body and bloud of Christ, is lyke vnto our co~uersion in baptisme, where outwardly no|thyng is changed, but remayneth the same that was before, but all the alteration is inwardely and spiritually.</P>

Thou wast the self same person,</HI> and yet by increace of faythe, thou wast made an other man. <HI>Outwardely nothynge was added, but all the chaunge was inwardly.</HI> And so was man made the son of Christ, and Christe fourmed in the mynd of man.

<P>Hytherto haue I rehersed the saiynges of Eu+sebius, whiche bee so playne, that no man can wyshe more playnely to bee declared, that this mutation of the bread and wyne into the body and bloud of Christe, is a spirituall mutation,
<PB REF="30">
and that outwardly nothyng is changed. But as outwardly we eate the bread, and drynke the wyne with our mouthes, so inwardly by faithe, wee spiritually eate the very fleshe, and drynke the very bloud of Christe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hilarius.</HI></NOTE>Hilarius also in fewe wordes saieth the same.
<Q>There is a figure (saieth he) for <HI>bread and wyne be outwardly seene.</HI> And there is also a truth of that fygure, for the body and bloude of Christe be of a truthe inwardly beleued.</Q>

<P>About the same tyme or shortly after, aboute the yeere our Lorde. 400. Saynte Iohn Chry|sostome wryteth thus, agaynst theim that vsed onely water in the sacrament.
<Q>Christe (sayth he) myndyng to plucke vp that heresye by the roo|tes, <HI>vsed wyne,</HI> as well before his resurrection, when he gaue the mysteries, as after at his ta|ble without mysteries. For he saith, of the fruit of the vyne, whyche surely bryngeth foorth no water, but wyne.</Q></P>
<P>These wordes of Chrysostome declare plain|ly, that Christe in his holy table, bothe dranke wyne, and gaue wyne to drynke, whych had not bene true, if no wyne had remayned after the Consecration, as the Papistes fayne.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="30">And yet more playnely Saynct Chrysostome declareth this matter in an other place, sayeng:
<Q>The breade beefore it bee sanctified,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ad Cesariu~ monachum.</HI></NOTE> is called breade, but whan it is sanctified by the meanes of the prieste, it is delyuered frome the name of breadde, and is exalted to the name of the Lor|des body, although <HI>the nature of bread doeth styll remayne.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The nature of bread (saith he) doeth styll re|mayn, to the vtter and manyfest confutation of the Papistes, whiche saye, that the accidentes of breadde dooe remayne, but not the nature and substance.</P>
<P>At the same tyme was S.

(as is before declared in the wordes of Eusebi|us) that he is made a new creature, and yet his substance remaineth the same that was before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augustinus in sermone ad infa~tes</HI></NOTE>And saint Augustin about the same time wrote thus:<Q> That whiche you see in the altare, is <HI>the bread and the cup, which also your eyes do shew you.</HI> But fayth sheweth further, that bread is the bo|dy of Christ, and the cuppe his bloude.</Q></P>
<P>Here he declareth foure thyngs, to be in the sa+crament. Two that we see, whiche be bread and wine. And other two, which we se not, but by fai|the only, whiche be the body and blud of Christ.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In lib. sen|tentiarun.

For <HI>euery thyng conteyneth in it, the very nature of those thynges, whereof it consysteth.</HI> Nowe the sacrifice of the Churche consysteth of two thynges, of the sacrament, and of the thyng thereby sygnified, that is to saye, the bodye of <HI>CHRISTE.</HI> Therfore there is bothe the sacra|ment, and the thynge of the sacrament, whyche is Christes bodye.</Q></P>
<P>What can be deuised to be spoken more plain+ly against the errour of the Papistes, which say that no bread nor wyne remaineth in the sacra|ment?
<PB N="27" REF="32">
For as the person of Christe consisteth of two natures, that is to say, of his manhod, and of his Godhead, (And therfore bothe those na|tures remayne in Christ,) euen so (sayth saynt-Augustin) the sacrament co~sisteth of two natue+res, of the eleme~tes of bread and wine, and of the body &amp; bloud of Christ, &amp; therfore both these na|tures must nedes remayne in the sacrament.</P>
<P>For the more playne vnderstandyng herof, it is to bee noted, that there were certayne herety|ques, as Simon&punc; Menander, Marcion, Ualen+tinus, Basilides, Cerdon, Manes, Eutiches, Manicheus, Apollinaris, and dyuers other of lyke sortes, whyche sayd, that Christ was very God, but not a very manne, althoughe in ea|tynge, drynkynge, sleapyng, and all other ope|rations of man, to mens iudgementes he ap|pered lyke vnto a man.</P>
<P>Other there were, as Artemon, Theodorus, Sabellius, Paulus Samasathenus, Marcel|lus, Photinus, Nestorius, and many other of the same sectes, whyche sayd, that he was a ve|ry naturall man, but not very God, although in geuyng the blynd their syghte, the dumbe theyr speeche, the deafe their hearynge, in healyng so|deynly with his worde al diseases, in raysyng to life them that were dead, and in al other workes of God, he shewed himselfe as he had been God.</P>
<P>Yet other there were which seyng the scripture so playne in those two matters, confessed that he was both God &amp; man, but not both at one tyme.
<PB REF="33">
For before his incarnation (sayde they) he was God onely, and not man, and after his incarna|tion, he ceased fro~ his Godhead, &amp; became a man onely, and not God, vntyl his resurrection or as|cension, and then (saye they) he left his manhod, and was only God agayn, as he was before his incarnation. So that whan he was ma~, he was not God, and wha~ he was God, he was not man</P>
<P>But against these vain heresies, the Catholike faith, by the expresse word of God, holdeth and beleueth, that Christ after his incarnation lefte not his diuine nature, but remained styll God, as he was before, beyng togyther at one tyme, (as he is styl) both perfect God and perfect ma~.</P>
<P>And for a playne declaracion hereof, the olde auncient authors geue two examples, one is of man, whiche is made of two partes, of a soule and of a body, and eche of these two partes re|mayne in man at one tyme. So that whan the soule, by the almyghty power of God, is put in to the body, neither the body nor soule perisheth thereby, but therof is made a perfect man, ha|uyng a perfect soule and a perfect body, remay|nyng in hym bothe at one tyme. The other exam+ple, whiche the olde authors brynge in for this purpose, is of the holy supper of our Lord, whi+che consisteth (say they) of two partes, of the sa|crament or visible element of bread &amp; wyne, and of the body and bloud of Christ. And as in them that duely receiue the sacrament, the very natu|res of bread and wyne cease not to be there, but
<PB N="28" REF="33">
remayne there styll, and be eaten corporally, as the body and bloud of Christ be eaten spiritual|ly: so likewyse doth the diuine nature of Christ remayne styl with his humanitee.</P>
<P>Let nowe the Papistes auaunt them selues of their Transubstantiation, that there remay|neth no bread nor wyne in the ministration of the sacrament, if they wyll defende the wicked heresies before rehersed, that Christ is not God and man both together. But to proue that this was the mynde of the olde authors, besyde the saiyng of sainct Augustyne here recited, I shall also reherse diuers other.</P>
<P>Sainct Ihon Chrysostome wryteth against the pestilent errour of Apollinaris,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chrysosto. ad Cesarium monachum.</HI></NOTE> whiche affir+med that the Godhead and manhead in Christ, were so myxed and confounded together, that they bothe made but one nature. Against who~ sainct Ihon Chrysostome writeth thus.</P>
<P><Q>Whan thou speakest of God, thou must con|syder a thyng, that in nature is syngle, with|out composition, without conuersion, that is inuisible, immortall, incircumscriptible, incom|prehensible, with suche lyke. And whan thou speakest of manne, thou meanest a nature that is weake, subiecte to hunger, thyrste, wepyng, feare, sweatyng, and suche lyke passions, whi|che can not bee in the diuine nature. And whan thou speakest of Christ, thou ioynest two natures together in one person, who is bothe passible and impassible: Passible as concer|nyng
<PB REF="34">
his fleshe, and impassible in his deitee.</Q></P>
<P>And after he concludeth, saiyng:
<Q>Wherfore Christe is bothe God and man. God by his im|passible nature, and man because he suffred. He himeslfe beyng one person, one sonne, one Lord, hath the dominion and power of two natures ioyned together, whiche be not of one substance, but eche of theim hath his properties distincte from the other. And therefore remayneth there two natures, distincte, and not confounded. For as before the consecration of the bread, we call it bread, but <HI>whan Goddes grace hath sanctified it by the priest, it is deliuered from the name of bread, and is exalted to the name of the body of the Lorde, although the nature of the bread remayne stil in it,</HI> and it is not called two bodyes, but one body of Gods sonne: so likewyse here, the diuine nature resteth in the body of Christ, and these two make one sonne, and one person.</Q></P>
<P>These wordes of sainct Chrysostome, declare and that not in obscure termes, but in playne wordes, that after the consecracion, the nature of bread remayneth styll, although it haue an hygher name, and bee called the body of Christ: to signifie vnto the godly eaters of that bread, that they spiritually eat the supernatural bread of the body of Christe, who spiritually is there present, and dwelleth in them, and they in him, although corporally he sytteth in heauen at the right hand of his father.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ius co~+tra Eutiche~ et Nestoriu~</HI></NOTE>Herevnto accordeth also Gelasius, writyng
<PB N="29" REF="34">
gainst Eutyches and Nestorius, of whome the one said, that Christ was a perfect man, but not God: and the other affirmed clean contrary, that hee was very God, but not man. But againste these two heinous heresies, Gelasius proueth bi moste manifest scriptures, that Christe is both god and man, and that after his incarnacion re|mained in hym the nature of his godheade, so that hee hathe in hym twoo natures with their naturall properties, and yet is hee but one Christe.</P>
<P>And for the more euident declaratio~ hereof, he bringeth two examples&punc; the one is of man, who beeynge but one, yet he is made of two partes, and hath in him two natures, remaininge both togyther in him, that is to saye, the bodye and the soule with their naturall properties.</P>
<P><Q>The other example is of the sacrament of the body &amp; bloud of Christ, which (saith he) is a god+ly thing&punc; and yet <HI>the substaunce or nature of breade and wine, do not cease to be there styll.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Note well these wordes againste all the Pa|pistes of our time, that Gelasius (which was by+shop of Rome more tha~ a thousa~d years passed) writeth of this sacrament, that the breade and wyne cease not to be there styll, as Christ ceased not to be god after his incarnation, but remay|ned styll perfect god, as he was before.</P>
<P>Theodoretus also affirmeth the same,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theodore|tus in dialo+gis.</HI></NOTE> both in his first and in his seconde dialoge. In the fyrst he saith thus.
<Q>He that called his naturall body,
<PB REF="35">
wheate and breade, and also called him selfe a vyne, the selfe same <HI>called bread and wyne his bo|dye and bloudde, and yet chaunged not their na|tures.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And in his seco~d dialogue he saith more plainly.
<Q>For (saith he) as <HI>the breade and wine after the con+secration lose not their propre nature, but kepe their former substance, forme, and figure,</HI> whiche they had before, euen so the body of Christ, after his ascention, was chaunged into the godlye sub|staunce.</Q></P>
<P>Nowe lette the Papistes choose, whyche of these two they wyll graunte, (for one of theim they muste needes graunte) either that the na|ture and substaunce of breadde and wine, re|mayne styll in the sacrament after the consecra|tion, (and then must thei recant their doctrine of Transubstantiation) or els that they bee of the errour of Nestorius and other, which didde say, that the nature of the Godhead, remained not in Christ after his incarnation. For all these old authors agree, that it is in the one, as it is in the other.</P>

Wher|fore I thought it good, somewhat to trauaile herein, to take awaye those Fygge leaues, that their shamefull errors may plainly to euery ma~ appeare.</P>

<P>The greatest reason and of most importance,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> and of suche strength (as they thynke) or at the least as they pretend,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The first reason of y^e Papistes to proue their tran|substa~tia|tion.</P>
<P>Math. 26 Mar. 14. Luc. 22. The an+swere.</P></NOTE> that all the worlde can not answere therto, is this: Our sauiour Christ, ta|kyng the bread, brake it, and gaue it to his disci|ples, saiyng: <HI>This is my body.</HI> Nowe (say they) assone as Christ had spoken these woordes, the bread was straight way altered and chaunged, and the substaunce thereof was conuerted into the substaunce of his precious body.</P>
<P>But what christian eares can paciently heare this doctryne, that Christe is euery day made a newe, and made of another substaunce, than he was made of in his mothers wombe&punc; For where as at his incarnation, he was made of the na|ture and substaunce of his blessed mother, nowe (by these Papistes opinion) he is made euery
<PB REF="37">
day of the nature and substa~ce of bread &amp; wyne, whiche (as they say) be turned into the substa~ce of his body and bloud. O what a meruailous Methamorphosis, and abhominable heresye is this? to say, that Christ is dayly made a newe, &amp; of a newe matter? wherof it foloweth necessari|ly, that they make vs euery day a newe Christ, and not the same that was borne of the virgyn Mary, nor that was crucifyed vpon the crosse, as it shall be plainly proued by these argumen|tes folowyng.</P>
<P>Fyrst thus. If Christes body that was cruci|fyed was not made of bread, but the body that was eaten in the supper was made of bread (as the Papistes say) than Christes body that was eaten, was not thesame that was crucified.</P>
<P>And againe: If Christes body that was cruci|fied, was not made of bread, and Christes body that was crucified was thesame that was eaten at his last supper, than Christes body that was eaten was not made of bread.</P>
<P>And moreouer: If Christes body that was eaten at the last supper was the same that was crucifyed, and Christes body that was eaten at the supper was made of bread (as the Papistes fayne,) than Christes body that was crucifyed, was made of bread.</P>
<P>And in lyke maner it foloweth: If the body of Christ in the sacrament, bee made of the sub|sta~ce of bread and wyne, and thesame body was conceiued in the virgyns wombe, than the body
<PB N="32" REF="37">
of Christ in the virgyns wombe, was made of bread and wyne.</P>
<P>Or els turne the argument thus. The body of Christ in the virgyns wombe was not made of bread &amp; wyne, but this body of Christ in the sacrament is made of bread and wyne, than this body of Christ is not the same that was concei|ued in the virgyns wombe.</P>
<P>Another argument. Christ that was borne in the virgyns wombe, as concernyng his body, was made of none other substance, but of the substance of his blessed mother, but Christ in the sacrament is made of another substance, than he is another Christ.</P>
<P>And so the Antichrist of Rome, the chiefe au|thor of all Idolatry, would bryng fayfthul chri|sten people, fro~ the true worshippyng of Christ, that was made and borne of the blessed virgyn Mary, through the operacion of the holy ghost, and suffered for vs vpon the crosse, to worship another Christ made of bread &amp; wyne, through the consecracion of a Popishe priest.</P>
<P>And thus the Popishe priestes make them selues the makers of God. For (say they) the priest by the woordes of consecracion maketh that thyng whiche is eaten and dronken in the Lordes supper, and that (say they) is Christ him selfe both God and man, and so they take vpon them to make both God and man.</P>
<P>But let all true worshippers worship one god, one Christ, ones corporally made, of one only
<PB REF="38">
corporall substance, that is to say, of the blessed virgyn Mary, that ones dyed, and rose ones a|gayne, ones ascended into heauen, and there sit|teth and shall sit at the right had of his father euermore, although spiritually he be eueryday amongest vs, &amp; whosoeuer come together in his name, he is in the myddes among them. And he is the spiritual pasture and foode of our soules, as meate and drynke is of our bodies, whiche he signifieth vnto vs by the institution of his most holy supper in bread and wyne, declaryng that as the bread and wyne corporally comforte and feede our bodyes, so doth he with his fleshe and bloud spiritually comfort and feede our soules.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The an|swere more directly.</NOTE>And nowe may be easyly answered the Papi|stes argument, whereof they do so muche boast. For bragge they neuer so muche of the conuer|sion of bread and wyne into the body and bloud of Christ, yet that conuersion is spirituall, and putteth not awaye the corporall presence of the material bread and wyne. But for asmuche as the same is a moste holy sacrament of our spiri|tual norishement, (whiche we haue by the body and bloud of our sauiour Christ) there must ne|des remayne the sensible element, that is to say, bread and wyne, without the whiche there can be no sacrament.</P>
<P>As in our spiritual regeneration there can be no sacrament of baptisme, if there be no water. For as Baptisme is no perfect sacrament of spi|ritual regeneration, without there be aswell the
<PB N="33" REF="38">
element of water, as the holy ghoste, spiritually regenerating the person that is baptised (which is signified by the saide water) euen so the sou|per of our Lorde can bee no perfecte sacramente of spirituall foode, except there be as well bread and wine, as the body and bloode of our sauiour Christ, spiritually feeding vs, which by the said breade and wine is signified.</P>
<P>And howe so euer the body and bloode of our sauiour Christ be ther prese~t, thei may as wel be present ther with the substance of bread &amp; wyne, as with the accidentes of the same, as the schole authors do confesse them selues, and it shall bee well proued yf the aduersaryes will denye it. Thus you se the strongest argumente of the Pa+pistes answered vnto, and the chiefe foundacion whervpon they buylde their errour of transub|stantiation, vtterlye subuerted and ouerthro|wen.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<P>An other reason haue they of lyke strengthe.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 9.</NOTE> If the breade shoulde remaine (saye they) than shulde folowe many absurdities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seco~d argument for tra~sub|stantiation</NOTE> and chiefely, that Christe hath taken the nature of breade, as he tooke the nature of manne, and so ioyned it to his substance. And than as we haue God vere|ly incarnate for our redemption, so shoulde wee haue him Impanate.</P>
<P>Thou mayste consydre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The aun|swere.</NOTE> good reader, that the reste of theyr reasons be very weake and feeble, whan these bee the chiefe and strongest. Truth it is in deede, that Christe shoulde haue beene
<PB REF="39">
impanate, yf hee hadde ioyned the breade vn|to his substaunce in vnitee of persone, that is to saye, yf hee hadde ioyned the breade vnto hym in suche sorte, that he had made the breade one persone with him selfe. But for as much as he is ioyned to the bread but sacramentally, ther foloweth no Impanation thereof, no more than the holy ghost is Inaquate, that is to say, made water, being sacramentally ioyned to the water in baptisme.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 3. Mark. 1. Luce, 3,</NOTE> Nor he was not made a doue, whan he toke vppon him the forme of a doue, to signi|fie that he, whome saint Iohn did baptise, was verye <HI>CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>But rather of the erroure of the Papistes theym selues (as one erroure draweth an other after it) shoulde folowe the greate absurditie, whiche they speake vppon, that is to saye, that Christe shoulde bee Impanate and Inuinate. For yf Christe doo vse the breade in suche wise, that he doeth not adnihilate and make nothing of it (as the Papistes say) but maketh of it hys owne bodye, than is the bread ioyned to his bo|dy, in a greater vnitee, than is his humanitee to his Godhead. For his Godhead is adioyned vnto his humanitee in vnitye of person, and not of nature. But our sauiour Christ (by their say|inge) adioyneth breade vnto his body in vnitee bothe of nature and person. So that the breade and the body of Christe be but one thinge, bothe in nature and person. And so is there a more en|tier vnion betwene Christe and breade, than be|tweene
<PB N="34" REF="39">
hys godheade and manhead, or betwene his sowle and his bodye. And thus these argu|mentes of the Papistes, retourne (lyke riueted nayles) vppon their owne heades.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<P>Yet a thyrde reason they haue,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 10.</NOTE> whyche they gather out of the syxte of Iohn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The thyrd reason, Iohn. 6.</NOTE> where <HI>CHRIST</HI>
sayeth: <Q>I am lyuely breade, which came from heauen. If anye manne eate of thys breade, he shall lyue for euer. And the breadde whiche I wyll giue, is my fleshe, whiche I wyll gyue for the lyfe of the worlde.</Q></P>
<P>Than reason they after this fashion. If the breade whyche Chryste gaue, bee his fleshe, that it canne not also bee materiall breade, and so it muste needes folowe, that the mate|riall breade is gone, and that none other sub|staunce remaineth, but the fleshe of <HI>CHRIST</HI> onlye.</P>
<P>To this is soone made answere:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The aun|swere.</NOTE> that Christ in that place of Iohn, spake not of the materiall and sacramentall breade, nor of the sacrementall eating, (for that was spoken two or thre yeares before the sacramente was fyrste ordained) but hee spake of spirituall breade
<Q>(manny tymes repetynge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 6.</NOTE> I am the bread of lyfe, which came frome heauen)</Q>and of spirituall eating by faith, after whiche sorte, hee was at the same presente tyme, eaten of as manye, as beleued on him, al|though the sacrame~t was not at that tyme made and instituted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 6.</NOTE> And therefore he saide:
<Q> Your fa|thers did eate Manna in the deserte, and died, but he that eateth this bread shall lyue for euer.</Q>
<PB REF="40">
Therefore this place of S. Iohn, canne in no wyse be vnderstand of the sacramentall breade, which neyther came fro~ heauen, neither giueth life to al that eat it. Nor of such bread <HI>CHRIST</HI> coulde haue than presentlye saide, This is my fleshe, excepte they wyll saye that Christe dydde than consecrate, so many yeares before the insti+titution of his holy supper.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 11.</NOTE>Nowe that I haue made a full direct &amp; plain answere to the vaine reasons and cauillacions of the Papistes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Authores wrested of the Papi|stes for their tran+substantia+ion.</NOTE> ordre requireth to make lyke|wise answere vnto their sophisticall allegacions and wresting of authors vnto their phantasty|call purposes. There bee chiefelye thre places, which at the fyrste shewe, seeme muche to make for their intent, but when they shalbe throughly wayed, thei make nothing for theim at all.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cyprianus De coena do+mini.</HI></NOTE>The fyrst is a place of Cyprian, in his sermon of the Lordes supper. where he saith, as is alle|ged in the Detection of the diuels sophistrye.
<Q>This breade which our lorde gaue to his disci|ples, <HI>chaunged in nature, but not in outward forme,</HI> is by the omnipotencye of goddes woorde, made fleshe.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The aun|swere.</NOTE>Here the Papistes sticke toothe and nayle to these woordes, <HI>Chaunged in nature.</HI> Ergo (say they) the nature of the bread is chaunged. Here is one chiefe point of the diuels sophistry vsed, whoe in allegacion of scripture vseth euer, ei|ther to adde thereto, or to take away from it, or to alter the sense therof, And so haue they in this
<PB N="35" REF="40">
author, lefte out those woordes whiche would open plainly all the whole matter.
For next the wordes, which be here before of them recited, do folowe these wordes.<Q> As in the person of Christ, the humanitee was seen, and the diuinitee was hyd, euen so dyd the diuinitee, ineffably putte it selfe into the visible sacrament. </Q>Whiche wordes of Cyprian do manyfestly shewe, that the sacra|ment, doth styll remayne with the diuinitee:
and that sacramentally the diuinitee is poured into the bread and wyne, the same bread &amp; wyne styll remainyng: like as thesame diuinitee by vnitee of person was in the humanitee of Christ, the same humanitee stil remainyng with y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> diuinite.</P>
<P>And yet the bread is chaunged, not in shape, nor substance, but in nature (as Cyprian truely sayth) not meanyng that the naturall substance of bread is cleane gone, but that by Gods word, there is added therto another higher propertie, nature and condition, farre passyng the nature and condicion of common bread, that is to saye, that the bread doth shewe vnto vs, (as the same Cyprian sayth) that wee bee partakers of the spirite of God, and moste purely ioyned vnto Christ, and spiritually feade with his fleshe and bloud, so that nowe the sayd misticall bread is both a corporall foode for the body, and a spiri|tual foode for the soule.</P>
<P>And likewise is the nature of the water chau~|ged in baptisme forasmuche as besyde his com|mon nature (whiche is to washe &amp; make cleane
<PB REF="41">
the body) it declareth vnto vs, that our soules he also washed &amp; made cleane by the holy ghost. And thus is answered the chiefe authoritee of the doctours, whiche the Papistes take for the principal defence of their error. But for further declaracion of sainct Cyprians mynde herein, reade the place of him before recited fol. 24.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 12 <HI>Chrysosto|mus.</HI></NOTE>Another authoritee they haue of sainct Ihon Chrysostome, whiche thei boast also to be inuin|cible.
Chrysostome (say they) writeth thus in a certaine homely <Q><HI>De Eucharistia. Doest thou see bread? Doest thou see wyne? Do they auoyde be|neth, as other meates do? God forbyd, thynke not so.</HI> For as waxe (if it be put into the fyre) it is made lyke the fyer, no substance remayneth, nothyng is lefte: so here also thynke thou, that <HI>the myste|ries be consumed by the substance of the body.</HI></Q></P>
<P>At these wordes of Chrysostome the Papistes do triumph, as though they had won the fielde. Lo (say they) doeth not Chrysostomus the great clarke say most plainly, that we se neither bread nor wyne? but that (as waxe in the fyer) they be consumed to nothyng, so that no substance re|mayneth? But if they had rehersed no more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The an+swere.</NOTE> but the very next sentence that foloweth in Chryso|stome (which craftily and maliciously thei leaue out) the meanyng of sainct Iohn Chrysostome would easily haue appeared, and yet wyll make them blushe, if they bee not vtterly past shame. For after the foresayd woordes of Chrysostome, immediatly folowe these wordes.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="41">
<Q>Wherfore (sayth he) whan ye comme to these mysteries, <HI>do not thynke, that you receiue by a man, the body of God,</HI> but that with tongues, you re|ceiue fyer by the Angels Seraphyn.</Q></P>
<P>And straight after it foloweth thus.</P>
<P><Q>Thynke that the bloud of saluacion floweth out of the pure and godly syde of Christ, and so co~myng to it, receiue it with pure lippes. Wher|fore brother, I pray you &amp; beseche you, let vs not be from the churche, nor let vs not be occupyed there with vaine co~munication, but let vs stand fearefull &amp; tremblyng, castyng doune our eyes, liftyng vp our myndes, mournyng priuely with out speache, and reioysyng in our heartes.</Q></P>
<P>These wordes of Chrysostome do folowe im|mediatly, after the other woordes, whiche the Papistes before rehersed. Therfore if the Pa|pistes wil gather of the wordes by them recited, that there is neither bread nor wyne in the sacra+ment, I may aswell gather of the woordes that folowe, that there is neither priest nor Christes body.</P>
<P>For as in the former sentence, Chrysostome sayth, that we may not thinke, that we see bread &amp; wyne: so in the second sente~ce he sayth, that we may not thynke, that wee receyue the body of Christ of the priestes handes. Wherfore if vpon the second sentence (as the Papistes them sel|ues wyll say) it can not be truely gathered, that in the holy Communion there is not the body of
<PB REF="42">
Christ ministered by the priest: then must they confesse also, that it can not bee well and truely gathered vpon the fyrst sentence, that there is no bread nor wyne.</P>
<P>But there be al these thynges together in the holy Communion, Christe himselfe spiritually eaten and drunken, and norishyng the right be|leuers, the bread &amp; wyne as a sacrament decla|ryng the same, and the priest as a minister ther|of. Wherfore S. Ihon Chrysostome ment not absolutely, to denye that there is bread &amp; wyne, or to denye vtterly the priest and the body of Christ to be there, but he vseth a speache, whiche is no pure Negatiue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negatiues by compa|rison.</NOTE> but a Negatiue by com|parison.</P>
<P>Whiche fashion of speeche, is co~monly vsed, not onely in the scripture, and among all good authors, but also in all maner of languages. For when two thynges bee compared together, in the extollyng of the more excelle~t, or abasyng of the more vyle, is many tymes vsed a Nega|tiue by comparishon, whiche neuerthelesse is no pure Negatiue, but onely in the respecte of the more excellent, or the more base.</P>
<P>As by example. When the people reiectyng the prophete Samuel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Reg. 8.</NOTE> desyred to haue a kyng, almightie God sayd to Samuel: <Q>They haue not reiected thee, but me.</Q>
Not meanyng by this negatiue absolutely, that they had not reiected Samuel (in whose place they desired to haue a kyng) but by that one negatiue by comparison
<PB N="37" REF="42">
he vnderstode two affirmatiues, that is to saye, that they had reiected Samuell, and not hym alone, but also y^t they had chiefely reiected God.</P>
<P>And whan the prophet Dauid said in the per|son "of Christe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 21.</NOTE> I am a worme, and not a man. by this negatiue, he denyed not vtterlye, that Christe was a man, but (the more vehementlye to expresse the great humyliation of Christe) he said, that he was not abased onely to the nature of man, but was broughte so lowe, that he might rather be called a worme, than a man.</P>
<P>This maner of speeche was familiar and v|suall to S. Paule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 7,</NOTE> as whan he sayde:<Q> It is not I that doe it, but it is the synne that dwelleth in me.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 1.</NOTE> And in an other place he saithe: Christe sent me not to baptise, but to preache the gospel. And agayn he saith:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 1.</NOTE> My speche and preachyng, was not in wordes of mans persuasion, but in manyfest declaration of the spirite and power. And he saith also:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 3.</NOTE> Neyther he that grafteth, nor he that watereth, is any thynge, but God that gyueth the increase. And he saieth moreouer: It is not I that lyue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 2. Gal. 6.</NOTE> but Christ lyueth within me. And, God forbydde, that I shoulde reioyce in any thyng, but in the Crosse of our Lord Ie|su Christe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephe. 6.</NOTE> And further, We doo not wrastle a|gainste fleshe and bloudde, but agaynst the spi|rites of darkenesse.</Q></P>
<P>In all these sentences, and many other lyke, although they bee negatiues, neuerthelesse S. Paule mente not, clerely to denye, that he dyd
<PB REF="43">
that euyl wherof he spake, or vtterly to say, that he was not sent to baptise (who in dede did bap|tise at certayn tymes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 1.</NOTE> and was sent to do al thin+ges that pertained to saluation) or that in his office of settynge foorthe Goddes word, he vsed no witty persuasions, (whiche in deede he vsed moste discreetely) or that the grafter and wate|rer bee nothyng, (whych be Goddes creatures, made to his similitude, &amp; without whose worke there shuld be no increase) or to say, that he was not alyue (who both lyued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 15.</NOTE> and ranne from cun+trey to countrey, to set foorth Goddes glory) or clerely to affirme, that he gloried and reioyced in no other thyng,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 11.</NOTE> tha~ in Christes crosse (who re+ioyced with all men that were in ioye, and soro|wed with all that were in sorowe) or to deny vt|terly, that we wrastle agaynst fleshe and bloud: (whych ceasse not dayly to wrastle and warre a|gaynst our enemies, the worlde, the fleshe and the dyuel.) In all these sentences S. Paule (as I sayde) ment not clerely to deny these thyngs, which vndoubtedly were all trewe, but he ment that in comparison of other greatter thynges, these smaller were not muche to be estemed, but that the greater thynges, were the chief thyngs to be consydered. As that syn committed by his infirmitie, was rather to be imputed to original syn, or corruption of nature, which lay lurkyng within hym, than to his owne will and consent. And that although he was sente to baptyse, yet he was chiefely sent to preache Goddes worde.
<PB N="38" REF="43">
And that althoughe he vsed wyse and discreete persuasions therin, yet the successe therof came principally of the power of God, and of the wor|kyng of the holy spirite. And that althoughe the grafter and waterer of the gardeyn be some thynges, and doo not a lyttell in theyr offyces, yet it is God chiefely, that geueth the increace. And that although he lyued in this worlde, yet his chiefe lyfe, concernyng God, was by Christ, whome he had lyuyng within hym. And that al|though he gloried in many other thynges, ye in his owne infirmitees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Cor. 11. &amp;. 12.</NOTE> yet his greattest ioy, was in the redemption by the crosse of Christe. And that althoughe oure spiryte dayly fyghteth a|gaynste our fleshe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal&punc; 5.</NOTE> yet our chiefe and principall fyght, is agaynst our gostely enemies, the sub|till and puisant wicked spirites and diuels.</P>
<P>The same maner of speeche vsed also S. Pe|ter in his fyrste epistle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P>In whyche maner of speche, he intended not vtterly to forbid al browderyng of hear, al gold and costly apparell to al women, (For euery one muste bee apparailed accordyng to their condi|tion, state and degree) but he ment hereby clere|ly to condempne all pryde and excesse in appa|rayle, and to moue all women that they should

study to deck their soules inwardly with al ver|tues, &amp; not to be curious, outwardly to deck and adorne their bodies with sumptuous apparell.</P>
<P>And our sauiour Christe hymselfe was full of "suche maner of speeches.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 6.</NOTE> Gather not vnto you (saieth he) treasure vpon earthe. wyllynge vs therby, rather to set our myndes vpon heauen|ly treasure, whyche euer endureth, than vpon earthly treasure, whiche by many sundry occa|sions perysheth, and is taken awaye frome vs. And yet wordly treasure muste nedes bee had, and possessed of some men, as the person, tyme, and occasion dooth serue.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10</NOTE>And in the same manner he spake, whan he sayde:<Q> It is not you that speake, but it is the spirite of God that speaketh within you.</Q>

<P>In all these negatiues, oure sauiour Christe spake not precisely &amp; vtterly to deny al y^e forsayd things, but in co~parison of them to prefer other thinges, as to preferre our father and lord in he+uen, aboue any worldly father, lord or master in earth, and his feare aboue the feare of any crea|ture, and his word and gospell aboue al worldly peace. Also to preferre spirituall and inward ho+noryng of God in pure hart &amp; mynd, aboue lo|call, corporal &amp; outward honor, and that Christe preferred his fathers glorye aboue his owne.</P>
<P>Now forasmuch as I haue declared at length, the nature and kynd of these negatiue speches, (whyche bee no pure negatiues, but by compa|rison) it is easy hereby, to make answere to S.

For it is no lesse mattier, to geue to thynges newe natures, than to alter natures.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus farre haue I rehersed the woordes of Saynt Ambrose, yf the sayd boke bee his (whi|che they that bee of greatest learnyng and iud|gement doo not thynke) by which woordes the Papistes would proue, that in the supper of the Lorde after the woordes of Consecration (as they bee commonly called) there remaineth nei|ther bread nor wyne, bycause that S. Ambrose saieth in this place, that the nature of the bread and wyne is chaunged.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The aun|swere.</NOTE>But to satisfie their myndes, let vs grant for their pleasure, that the forsaid boke was Saint Ambrose owne worke, yet the same boke maketh nothynge for their purpose, but quite agaynste them. For he saieth not, that the substaunce of bread and wyne is gone, but he sayth, that theyr nature is chaunged, that is to saye, that in the holy communion we oughte not to receaue the bread and wyne, as other common meates and drynkes, but as thynges cleane chaunged into a hygher estate, nature, and condition, to be ta|ken as holy meates and drynkes, wherby we re|ceaue spirituall feedyng, and supernaturall no|rishement
<PB N="42" REF="47">
from heauen, of the very true body and bloud of our sauior Christ, through the om+nipotent power of God, and the wonderfull wor+kyng of the holy ghost. Whiche so well agreeth with the substance of bread and wyne styl remai+nynge, that if they were gone awaye, and not there, this our spirituall feedyng, coulde not be taught vnto vs by theim.</P>
<P>And therfore in the most part of the exa~ples, whiche S. Ambrose allegeth for the wonderful alteration of natures, the substaunces dyd styll remayne, after the nature and proprieties were chaunged. As whan the water of Iordane (con|trary to his nature) stoode styll lyke a wall, or flowed against the streame towardes the head &amp; spryng, yet the substaunce of the water remay|ned the same that it was before. Lykewyse the stone, that aboue his nature and kynde flowed water, was the selfe same stone that it was be|fore. And the fludde of Marath, that chaunged his nature of bytternesse, chaunged for all that no part of his substance. No more did that yron, whiche contrary to his nature, swam vpon the water, lose thereby any parte of the substaunce thereof. Therfore as in these alteracions of na|tures, the substaunces neuerthelesse remay|ned the same, that they were before the alteraci|ons: euen so doeth the substaunce of bread and wyne remayne in the Lordes supper, and be na|turally receiued and digested into the body, not withstandyng the sacramental mutacion of the
<PB REF="48">
same into the body and bloud of Christ. Which sacramentall mutation declareth the superna|turall spirituall and inexplicable eatynge and drynkynge, feedyng and digestyng of the same body and bloudde of Christe, in all theim, that godly and accordyng to theyr duetie, do receiue the sayd sacramentall bread and wyne.</P>
<P>And that Saynt Ambrose thus ment, that the substance of breade and wyne remayne styll af|ter the consecration, it is moste clere by three o|ther examples of the same mater, folowynge in the same chapiter. One is of theym that bee regenerated, in whome after theyr regenerati|on dooeth styll remayne theyr former naturall substaunce. An other is of the Incarnation of our Sauiour Christe, in the whyche peryshed no substaunce, but remayned as well the sub|staunce of his godhead, as the substance whiche he tooke of the blessed vyrgin Mary. The third exaumple is of the water in baptisme, where the water styll remayneth water, although the holy ghost come vpon the water, or rather vpon him that is baptised therein.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lis.</HI> 4. <HI>De s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ramentis cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE>And although the same sainct Ambrose, in an other booke entitled <HI>De sacramentis,</HI> doeth saye, <Q>that the bread is bread before the wordes of con|secration, but <HI>when the consecration is doone, of bread is made the body of Christe</HI>:</Q>
Yet in the same booke, &amp; in the same chapiter, he telleth in what maner and forme the same is done, by the woor|des of Christ: not by takyng away the substance
<PB N="43" REF="48">
of the bread, but addyng to the bread, the grace of Christs body, &amp; so calling it the body of Christ</P>
<P>And hereof he bryngeth .iiii. examples. The first of the regeneration of a man: the second is of the standyng of the water of the red sea: the third is of the bytter water of Marath: and the fourthe is of the yron that swamme aboue the water. In euery of the whyche exaumples, the former substance remayned stylle, not withstan|dyng alteration of the natures. And he conclu|deth the whole matter in these fewe woordes.
<Q>If there be so muche strength in the woordes of the Lorde Iesu, that thynges had theyr begyn|nynge, whiche neuer were before, howe muche more be they able to worke, that those thynges, that were before, should remayn, &amp; also be chan|ged into other thynges?</Q>
Which wordes do sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w manyfestly, that not withstandyng this wonder+full sacramental and spiritual changyng of the bread into the body of Christ, yet the substa~ce of the bread remayneth y^e same, that it was before.</P>
<P>Thus is a sufficient answere made vnto thre principall authoritees, whiche the Papistes vse to allege, to stablysh their errour of transubsta~|tiation. The first of Cyprian, the second of S. Iohn Chrysost. and the thirde of S. Ambrose. Other authoritees and reasons som of them do brynge for the same purpose, but forasmuche as they be of small moment and weight, and easy to be answered vnto, I wil passe them ouer at this tyme, and not trouble the reader with them, but

<P><MILESTONE N="1"><HI>FYRST,</HI> if the Papistes be demanded, what thyng it is, that is broken, what is eaten, what is dronken, and what is chawed with the teeth, lyppes, and mouth in this sacrament, they haue nothyng to answere, but the accidences. For (as they say) bread and wyne bee not the visible ele|ment in this sacrament, but onely their acciden|tes. And so they be forced to saye, that acciden|tes be broken, eaten, dronken, chawen, and swa|lowed without any substance at all: whyche is not onely agaynst all reason, but also agaynste the doctrine of all auncient authors.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"> Secondly, these Transubstantiatours do say (contrary to al learnyng) that the accidentes of bread and wine do hang alone in the ayre with|out any substance, wherin they may bee staied. And what can be sayd more foolyshely?</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"> Thirdly, that the substance of Christes body is there really, corporally and naturally present without any accidentes of the same. And so the Papistes make accidentes to be without substa~+ces, and substances to bee without accidentes.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"> Fourthely, they say, that the place where the bread and wyne bee, hath no substaunce there to fyll that place, and so must they nedes graunte
<PB N="44" REF="49">
<HI>vacuum,</HI> whiche nature vtterly abhorreth.</P>
<P>Fiftly, thei ar not ashamed to say, that substa~ce <MILESTONE N="5"> is made of accide~tes, whe~ the breade mouleth, or is turned into worms, or wha~ the wyne sowreth.</P>
<P>Sixtly, that substa~ce is norished without sub|sta~ce,<MILESTONE N="6"> by accidentes onely, if it chance any catte, mouse, dogge, or any other thyng, to eate the sa|cramentall bread, or drink the sacramental wine</P>
<P>These inconueniences and absurditees do fo|lowe of the fond Papistical transubstantintion, with a numbre of other errors as euyll or worse than these, whervnto they bee neuer able to an|swere, as many of them haue co~fessed themselfs.</P>
<P>And it is a wonder to see, how in many of the forsaid thynges, they vary among them selues.</P>
<P>Where as the other doctrine of the scripture, and of the old catholike churche (but not of the lately corrupted Romyshe church) is playn and easy, as well to be vnderstanded, as to answere to all the foresayd questions, without any absur+ditee or inconuenience folowyng therof: so that euery answere shall agree with Goddes worde, with the olde Churche, and also with all reason and true Philosophie.</P>
<P>For as touchyng the fyrst poynt, what is bro|ken, what is eaten, what dronken, and what cha+wed in this sacrament, it is easy to answere, The bread and wyne, as S. Paule saith: The bread whiche we breake.</P>
<P>And as co~cernyng the second &amp; third pointes; neither is the substance of bread &amp; wine without
<PB REF="50">
their proper accidentes, nor their accidentes hang alone in the ayre without any substaunce, but accordyng to all learnyng, the substance of the bread and wyne reserue their owne acciden|tes, and the accidentes do rest in their owne sub+stances.</P>
<P>And also as concernyng the fourth poynt, there is no place lefte voyde after Consecracion (as the Papistes dreame) but bread and wyne fulfyll their places, as they did before.</P>
<P>And as touchyng the fift point (whereof the wormes or moulyng is engendred, and whereof the vyneger commeth) the answere is easye to make (accordyng to all learnyng and experie~ce) that they come, (accordyng to the course of na|ture) of the substaunce of the bread and wyne to long kept, and not of the accide~tes alone, as the Papistes do fondly phantasy.</P>
<P>And likewise the substances of bread &amp; wyne, do feede and norishe the body of them, that eate the same, and not the only accidentes.</P>
<P>In these answeres is no absurditie nor incon+uenience, nothyng spoken, either contrarye to holy scripture, or to natural reason, Philosophy or experience, or against any olde auncient au|thor, or the primatiue or catholike churche, but onely against the malignant and Papisticall church of Rome. Where as on the other syde, y^t cursed synagoge of Antichrist, hath defined and determined in this matter, many thynges con|trary to Christes wordes, contrary to the olde
<PB N="45" REF="50">
catholike church, and the holy martyrs and doc|toures of the same, and contrary to all naturall reason, learnynge and phylosophy.</P>
<P>And the final end of all this Antichrists doc|trine is none other, but by subtelty and crafte, to bringe christian people from the true honou|ringe of Christ, vnto the greatest ydolatry, that euer was in this worlde deuised: as by goddes grace shalbe plainly sette forth hereafter.</P>

<P>They saye, that Christe is reallye in the sa|cramentall breade beeynge reserued an whole yeare, or so longe as the fourme of breade re|maineth, but after the receiuynge thereof, hee flyeth vp (say they) frome the receiuer, vnto hea+uen, as soone as the breade is chawed in the mouth, or chaunged in the stomacke: But wee say, that Christ remayneth in the man that wor|thely receiueth it, so longe as the manne remay|neth a membre of Christe.</P>
<P>They say, that in the sacrament, the corporall membres of Christe be not distaunt in place, one from another, but that wheresoeuer the head is, there be the feete, and wheresoeuer the armes be, there be the legges, so that in euery parte of the bread &amp; wyne, is altogither, whole head, whole feete, whole fleshe, whole bloud, whole hearte, whole lunges, whole brest, whole backe, and al|togither whole, confused, and mixte withoute di|stinction or diuersitie. O what a foolishe and an abhominable inuencion is this, to make of the moste pure and perfect body of Christe, suche a confuse and monstruous body?

all Christian people must receyue the same, as an oracle of God, and as a moste certayne ar|ticle of their fayth, without whisperyng to the contrary.</P>
<P>Furthermore the Papistes say, that a dogge or a Catte eate the body of Christe, if they by chaunce do eate the sacramental bread: We say that no yearthly creature can eate the body of Christ, nor drynke his bloud, but onely man.</P>
<P>They say, that euery ma~ good and euil eateth the body of Christe: We say, that bothe do eate the sacramental bread and drynke the wyne, but none do eate the very body of Christ and drynke his bloud, but only they that be liuely membres of his body.</P>
<P>They say, that good menne eate the body of Christ, and drynke his bloud, only at that tyme whan they receiue the sacrament: We say, that they eate, drinke, and feede of Christ co~tinually, so long as they be membres of his body.</P>
<P>They say, that the body of Christe that is in the sacrament, hath his owne proper fourme and quantitee: We say, that Christ is there sa|cramentally and spiritually, without fourme or quantitee.</P>
<P>They say, that the fathers &amp; prophetes of the olde testament, did not eate the body nor drunke the bloud of Christ: We say, that they dyd eate his body &amp; drunke his bloud, although he was not yet borne nor incarnated.</P>

<P>Thei say, that the Masse is a sacrifice satisfa|ctory for sinne, by the deuocion of the priest that offereth, &amp; not by the thyng that is offered: But we say, that their saiyng is a most haynous lye &amp; detestable error, against the glory of Christ. For the satisfactio~ for our synnes, is not the deuocio~ nor offeryng of the priest, but the only hoost and satisfaction for all the sinnes of the world, is the death of Christ, &amp; the oblacion of his body vpon the crosse, that is to say, the oblacion that Christ him selfe offered ones vpon the crosse, and neuer but ones, nor neuer none but he. And therfore that oblation whiche the priestes make dayly in their papistical Masses, can not be a satisfactio~ for other mens synnes by the priestes deuocion, but it is a mere elusion and subtyll craft of the deuil, wherby Antichrist hath many yeres blyn|ded and deceiued the worlde.</P>
<P>They say, that Christe is corporally in many places at one tyme, affirmyng that his body is corporally and really present, in as many places as there be hoostes consecrated: We say, that as the sonne corporally is euer in heauen, and no where els, and yet by his operation and vertue, the Sonne is here in yearth (by whose influence

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De essentia diuinitatis.</HI></NOTE>Also in an other booke, entitled to sainct Au|gustine, is written thus.
<Q>We muste beleue and confesse, that the sonne of god (as co~cerning his diuinite) is inuisible, without a body, immortal, and incircumscriptible, but <HI>as concernyng his hu|manitee,</HI> we ought to beleue and confesse, that he

is visible, hath a body, and <HI>is contayned in a cer|tayne place, and hath truely al the membres of a man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Of these wordes of S. Augustyne, it is most cleare, that the profession of the catholike fayth is, that Christ (as co~cernyng his bodely substa~ce and nature of man) is in heauen, and not present here with vs in yearth. For the nature and pro|perty of a very body, is to be in one place, and to occupie one place, and not to be euery where, or in many places at one tyme. And though the body of Christ, after his resurrection and ascen|cion, was made immortal, yet the nature therof was not chaunged, for than (as saint Augustyn sayth) it were no very body. And further sainct Augustyne sheweth, bothe the maner &amp; fourme, howe Christ is here present with vs in yearth, &amp; howe he is absent, saiyng, that he is present by his diuine nature and Maiestie, by this proui|dence, and by his grace, but by his humaine na|ture and very body, he is absent fro~ this worlde, and present in heauen.</P>
<P>Cyrillus likewyse vpon the Gospel of sainct Ihon agreeth fully with S. Augustyne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cyrillus in Ihon. lib.</HI> 6. <HI>ca.</HI> 14.</NOTE> saiyng <Q>Although <HI>Christ toke away fro~ hence the presence of his body,</HI> yet in the Maiestie of his Godhead he is euer here, as he promised to his disciples at his departyng, saiyng: I am with you euer vnto the worldes ende.</Q></P>
<P>And in another place of the same boke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Libro.</HI> 9. <HI>cap.</HI> 21.</NOTE> sainct Cyril sayth thus.</P>
<P><Q>Christian people must beleue, that although
<PB REF="57">
<HI>Christ be absent from vs, as concernyng his body,</HI> yet by his power he gouerneth vs and all thyn|ges, and is present with all them that loue him. Therfore he sayd, Truly truly, I say vnto you, whersoeuer there be two or thre gathered toge|ther in my name, there am I in the myddes of them. For like as when he was conuersant here in yearth as a man, yet than he fylled heauen, &amp; did not leaue the company of Angels: euen so <HI>beyng nowe in heauen with his fleshe,</HI> yet he fyl|leth the yerth, &amp; is in them that loue him. And it is to be marked, that although <HI>Christ should go away onely as concernyng his fleshe,</HI> (for he is euer present in the power of his diuinite) <HI>yet for a ly|tle tyme he sayd he would bee with his disciples</HI>:</Q>These be the wordes of sainct Cyril.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ambrosius in Lucam. li.</HI> 10. <HI>ca.</HI> 24</NOTE>Sainct Ambrose also sayth, that we must not seeke Christ vpon yearth, <HI>nor in yearth, but in hea|uen, where he sytteth at the right hand of his father.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gregorius in Ho. pas|chatis.</HI></NOTE>And likewyse sainct Gregorye wryteth thus.
<Q>Christe (sayth he) <HI>is not here by the presence of his fleshe,</HI> and yet he is absent no where by the pre|sence of his Maiestie.</Q></P>
<P>What subtiltee thynkest thou (good reader) can the Papistes nowe imagyne, to defend their pernitious errour, that Christe in his humayne nature is bodely here in yearth, in the conse|crated bread and wyne: seyng that all the olde Churche of Christ beleued the contrary, and all the olde authors wrote the contrary?</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="57">For they all affirmed &amp; beleued, that Christe, beyng but one parson, hath neuerthelesse in him twoo natures or substaunces, that is to say, the nature of his Godhead, and the nature of his manhood. They say furthermore, that Christe is both goone hence from vs vnto heauen, and is also here with vs in yearth, but not in his hu|mayne nature, (as the Papistes would haue vs to beleue) but the olde authors saye, that he is in heauen, as concernyng his manhoode, and neuerlesse both here and there, and euery where, as concernyng his Godhead. For although his diuinitee bee suche, that it is infinite, without measure, compasse or place, so that as concer|nyng that nature, he is circumscribed with no place, but is euery where, and fylleth all the worlde: yet as concernyng his humayne nature, he hath measure, compasse and place, so that whan he was here vpon yearth, he was not at the same tyme in heauen: and nowe that he is ascended into heauen, as concernyng that na|ture, he hath nowe forsaken the yearth, and is onely in heauen.</P>

and with Ezechiell in Chober, wherby he proueth, that the holy ghost is God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Wherfore the Papistes (whiche saie, that the body of Christe is in an infinite numbre of pla|ces at one tyme) doo make his body to bee God, and so confounde the two natures of Christ, at|tributyng to his humaine nature, that thynge whiche belongeth onely to his diuinitee, whiche is a moste heynous and detestable heresy.</P>
<P>Agaynst whome writeth Fulgentius in this wyse, speakyng of the distinction and diuersitee of the two natures in <HI>CHRISTE.</HI></P>
<P><Q>One and the selfe same Christe (saythe he) of mankynd was made a man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fulgentius ad Trasimu~ dum Regem lib.</HI> 2.</NOTE> <HI>compassed in a place,</HI>
who of his father is God, without measure or place. One and the selfe same person, as concer+nyng his mans substaunce, was not in heauen, whan he was in yearth, and <HI>forsooke the yearthe, when he ascended into heauen</HI>: but as concernynge his godly substaunce (whiche is aboue all mea|sure) he neither lefte heauen, when he cam from heauen, nor he left not the yearthe, whan he as|cended into heauen, whiche may be knowen by the moste certayn worde of Christ hym self, who to shewe <HI>the placyng of his humanitee,</HI> sayd to his disciples: I ascende vp to my father and youre father, to my God and your God. Also when he had sayd of Lazarus, that he was dead, he ad|ded, saiyng: I am glad for your sakes, that you maye beleeue. For <HI>I was not there</HI>: but to shewe the vnmeasurable compasse of his diuinitee, he
<PB REF="59">
sayd to his disciples: Beholde, I am with you alwaies vnto the worldes ende.</Q>
Nowe how dyd he go vp into heauen, but because <HI>he is a verye man conteined within a place</HI>? Or <HI>howe is he present with faythfull people, but because he is very God, beynge without measure</HI>?</P>
<P>Of these wordes of Fulgentius it is declared most certainly, that Christe is not here with vs in earth, but by his godhead, &amp; that his humani+tee is in heauen onely, and absent from vs.</P>
<P>Yet the same is more plainly shewed (yf more playnely can bee spoken) by Uigilius a byshop and an holy martyr.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vigilius Contra Eu|tychen li|bro.</HI> 1.</NOTE> He writeth thus agaynste the heretike Eutyches, whyche denyed the hu|manite of <HI>CHRISTE,</HI> holdynge opinion, that he was onely God, and not manne.

<P>Thus farre haue I rehersed the woordes of Ui|gilius. and by and by he concludeth thus.
<Q>He is with vs, and not with vs, For <HI>those whome he lefte, and went from them, as concernyng his huma|nitee,</HI> those he lefte not, nor forsoke them not, as touchyng his diuinitee. For <HI>as touchyng the form of a seruant (which he toke away from vs into heuen) he is absent from vs,</HI> but by the fourme of God, (whyche goeth not from vs) he is present with vs in earth: and neuerthelesse both present and
<PB REF="60">
absent, he is all one Christe.</Q></P>
<P>Hytherto you haue herd Uigilius speke, that Christ as concernynge his bodily presence, and the nature of his manhode, is gone from vs, ta|ken from vs, is gone vp into heuen, is not with vs, hath left vs, hath forsaken vs. But as con|cernyng the other nature of his deitee, he is styl with vs, so that he is bothe with vs, and not with vs: with vs in the nature of his deitee, and not with vs in the nature of his humanitee.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Contra Eu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yche~ lib.</HI> 4</NOTE>And yet more clerely doth the same Uigilius de+clare the same thyng in an other place, sayenge:</P>
<P><Q>If the worde and the fleshe were bothe of one nature, seyng that the word is euery where, why is not <HI>the fleshe</HI> than euery where? For <HI>whan yt was in earthe, than verily it was not in heauen: and nowe whan it is in heauen, it is not surely in yearth.</HI> And it is <HI>so sure, that it is not in earth,</HI> that as con|cernyng it, we looke for hym to come from hea|uen, whom as concernyng his eternall woorde, we beleue to bee with vs in earthe: Therfore by your doctrine (saith Uigilius vnto Eutyches, who defended, that the diuinitee and humanite in Christe was but one nature) either the word is conteyned in a place with his fleshe, or els the fleshe is euery where with the worde. For <HI>one na+ture can not receaue in it selfe two diuers and contra+ry thinges.</HI> But these two thinges be dyuers and farre vnlyke, that is to say, to be conteyned in a place, and to be euery where. Therfore in as mu|che as the word is euery where, and the fleshe is
<PB N="55" REF="60">
not euery where, it appeareth playnly, that one Christ hym self hath in hym two natures, &amp; that by his diuine nature, he is euery where, and <HI>by his humain nature, he is conteined in a place,</HI> that he is created, &amp; hath no beginnyng, that he is sub|iect to death, &amp; can not die. Wherof one he hath by the nature of his worde (wherby he is God) &amp; the other he hath by y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nature of his fleshe, wher by the same God is man also. Therfore one son of God, the self same was made the sonne of ma~, and he hath a begynnynge by the nature of his fleshe, and no begynnynge by the nature of his Godheade. He is created by the nature of his fleshe, and not created by the nature of his God|head. <HI>He is comprehended in a place, by the nature of his fleshe,</HI> and not comprehended in a place by the nature of his Godhead. He is inferiour to angels in the nature of his fleshe, and is equall to his father in the nature of his Godhead. He dyed by the nature of his fleshe, and died not by the nature of his Godhead. This is the faithe and catholyke confession, whyche the Apostles taught, the martyrs dyd corroborate, and faith|full people kepe vnto this daie.</Q></P>
<P>All these be the saiynges of Uigilius, who (ac|cordyng to al the other authors before rehersed, and to the faith and catholike confession of the apostles, martyrs, and all faithfull people vnto his tyme) saith, that as concernyng Christes hu|manitee, whan he was here on erthe, he was not in heauen: and nowe whan he is in heauen, he
<PB REF="61">
he is not in earthe. For one nature can not bee both conteyned in a place in heauen, and be also here in earthe at one tyme. And for asmuche as Christe is here with vs in earth, and also is con|teined in a place in heauen, he proueth thereby, that Christ hath two natures in hym, the nature of a man (wherby he is gon from vs, and ascen|ded into heauen) and the nature of his godhed, wherby he is here with vs in erth. So that it is not one nature y^t is here with vs, &amp; that is gone from vs: that is ascended into heauen, and ther co~teined, &amp; that is permane~t here with vs in erth</P>
<P>Wherfore the Papistes (whiche nowe of late yeares haue made a newe faythe) that Christes naturall bodye is really and naturally present bothe with vs here in earthe, and sytteth at the ryght hande of his father in heauen, do erre in two very horrible heresies.</P>
<P>The one, that thei confound his two natures, his godhead, &amp; his manhod, attributynge vnto his humanitee, that thyng, which appertaineth only to his diuinitee, that is to say, to be in he|uen and erth, and in many places at one tyme.</P>
<P>The other is, that they deuide and separate his humain nature, or his body, makyng of one body of Christ. ii. bodyes, and ii. natures, one whiche is in heauen, visible and palpable, ha|uing al membres and proportions of a most per+fect natural man, &amp; an other which they say is in erth here with vs, in euery bread and wyne that is consecrated, hauing no distinction, forme nor
<PB N="56" REF="61">
proporcion of membres. whiche contrarieties &amp; diuersities (as this holy martyr Uigilius saith) can not be together in one nature.</P>

<P>Christ toke bread (say they) blessed, and brake it, and gaue it to his disciples, saiyng: This is my body. These woordes they euer styll repeate and beate vpon, that Christe sayd, This is my body. And this saiyng they make their shote an|ker, to proue therby, aswell the real and nataral presence of Christes body in the sacrament, as their imagined Transubstantiation. For these woordes of Christ (say they) be most playne and
<PB REF="62">
most true. Than forasmuch as he sayd, This is my body. it must nedes be true, that that thyng whiche the priest holdeth in his ha~des, is Chri|stes body.

Wherfore this sen|tence can not meane as the woordes seme and purport, but there must nedes be some figure or mystery in this speeche, more than appeareth in the plaine wordes.

<P>More ouer Cyrill vpon Sayncte Iohn saith, that Christe gaue to his disciples  <Q><HI>peces of bread,</HI></Q>saiyng: Take, eate, this is my bodye.</P>
<P>Likewise Theodoretus saith, Whan Christe gaue the holy mysteries, <Q><HI>he called bread his body,</HI> and <HI>the cuppe myxt with wyne and water, he called his bloude.</HI></Q>
By all these forsaid authors, and pla+ces, with manny mo, it is playnely proued, that whan our Sauiour Christe gaue breadde vnto his Disciples: sayinge: Take, and eate, this is my body, And lykewise when he gaue them the
<PB REF="64">
cuppe, sayinge: Diuide this amonge you, and drynke you all of this, for this is my bludde: he called than the very materiall bread his bodye, and the very wyne his bloudde.</P>
<P>That bread (I say) that is one of the creatu|res here in earth amonge vs, and that groweth out of the earth, and is made of many graynes of corne, beaten into flower, and mixed with wa+ter, and so baken &amp; made into bread, of such sort as other our bred is, that hath neither sence nor reason, &amp; finally that fedeth and nourisheth our bodies, suche bread Christe called his bodye, whan he sayd, This is my body. And such wine as is made of grapes pressed togyther, and ther of is made drynke, whiche norisheth the body, suche wyne he called his bloud.</P>
<P>This is the true doctrine, confirmed as well by holy scripture, as by all auncient authors of Christes churche, bothe Grekes and Latines, that is to say, that when our Sauiour Christe gaue bread and wyne to his disciples, and spake these woordes, This is my bodye, This is my bloude. it was very bread and wyne whiche he called his body and bloud.</P>
<P>Now let the Papistes shewe some authoritee for their opinion, eyther of scripture, or of some auncient author. And let theim not constrayne all men to folowe their fonde deuises, onely by|cause they sai, It is so, without any other grou~d or authoritee, but their owne bare wordes. For in suche wyse credite is to bee geuen to Goddes
<PB N="59" REF="64">
worde onely, and not to the worde of any man.</P>
<P>As many of theym as I haue redde (the by|shop of Wynchester only excepted) doo say, that Christe called not the bread his body, nor wyne his bloud, whan he said, This is my body, This is my bloude, and yet in expounding these wor|de~s, thei vary amo~g them selfes: which is a toke~ that thei be vncertain of their owne doctrine.</P>
<P>For some of them saye, that by this pronoune demonstratiue (this) Christ vnderstode not the bread nor wyne, but his body and bloud.</P>
<P>And other som say, that by the pronoune (this) he ment nether the bread nor wyne, nor his body nor bloud, but that he ment a particular thyng vncertayne, whiche they cal <HI>Indiuiduum vagum,</HI> or <HI>Indiuiduum in genere,</HI> I trow some Mathema|ticall quiditee, they can not tell what.</P>
<P>But let all these Papistes together shew any one authoritee, either of scripture, or of auncient author, either Greke or Latin, that saith as thei say, that Christ called not breade and wyne his body and bloud, but <HI>Indiuiduum vagum,</HI> and for my part I shall geue theim place, and confesse that they say trewe.</P>
<P>And if they can shewe nothynge for theym of antiquitee, but onely their owne bare wordes, than it is reason that thei geue place to the tru|the, confirmed by so many authoritees, both of scripture and of auncient writers, which is, that Christ called very material bread his body, and very wyne made of grapes, his bloud.</P>

<P>Fyrst when our sauiour Christ in the sixte of Iohn sayd,<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 6.</NOTE> that he was the bread of life, the whe~+che
<PB N="60" REF="65">
whosoeuer did eate, should not dye, but liue for euer. &amp; that the bread whiche he would geue vs, was his fleshe, and therefore whosoeuer should eate his fleshe and drynke his bloud, should haue euerlastyng lyfe, and they that should not eate his fleshe and drynke his bloud, should not haue euerlastyng life.</Q>
When Christ had spoken these woordes, with many mo of the eatyng of his fleshe and drinkyng of his bloud, both the Iewes &amp; mani also of his disciples wer offended with his wordes, and sayd:
<Q>This is an hard saiyng. For howe can he geue vs his fleshe to be eaten?</Q>Christ perceiuing their murmuring heartes (because they knewe none other eatyng of his fleshe, but by chawyng and swalowyng) to declare that they should not eate his body after that sorte, nor that he ment of any suche carnall eatyng, he sayd thus vnto theim. 
<Q>What if you see the sonne of man ascende vp where he was be+fore? It is the spirite that geueth life, the fleshe auayleth nothyng. The wordes whiche I spake vnto you, be spirit and life.</Q></P>
<P>These wordes our sauior Christ spake, to lift vp their myndes fro~ yearth to heauen, &amp; fro~ car|nal to spiritual eatyng, that thei should not pha~|tasy, that they should with their trethe eate him prese~tly here in yearth, for his flesh so eate~ (sayth he) should nothyng profite them. And yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o thei should not eate him, for he would take his body away from them, and ascend with it into heuen.
And there by fayth, &amp; not with teeth, they should
<PB REF="66">
spiritually eate him sittyng at the right hand of his father. <Q>And therfore (sayth he) The wordes whiche I do speake, be spirite and life.</Q>
that is to say, are not to be vnderstand, that we shall eate Christ with our teethe grossely and carnally, but that we shall spiritually &amp; gostly with our fayth eate him, beyng carnally absent from vs in hea|uen.
And in suche wyse, as Abraham and other holy fathers did eate him, many yeres before he was incarnated and borne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10</NOTE> As S. Paule sayth,<Q> that they did eate the same spiritual meate that wee do, and dranke the same spirituall drynke, that is to saye, Christe.</Q>
For they spiritually by their fayth were fed and norished with Christes body and bloud, and had eternal life by him, be|fore he was borne, as we haue nowe, that come after his ascencion.</P>
<P>Thus haue you hearde, the declaracion of Christe him selfe and of sainct Paule, that the eatyng and drinkyng of Christes fleshe &amp; bloud,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P>And vpon the Epistle of sainct Paule to the Corinthians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P><PB N="64" REF="69">Of these places of sainct Chrysostome, sainct Hierom and sainct Ambrose, it is cleare, that in the sacramentall bread and wyne, is not really and corporally the very natural substance of the flesh and bloud of Christ, but that the bread and wyne be similitudes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Signes &amp; figures haue the names of the thi~ges which thei signifie.</NOTE> mysteries and representa|cions, significations, sacramentes, figures and signes of his body and bloud: and therefore be called, and haue the name of his very fleshe and bloud.</P>
<P>And yet S. Augustyne sheweth this matter more clearely and fully,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>August. ad Bonifatium Episto.</HI> 23.</NOTE> than any of the rest, spe|cially in an Epistle which he wrote <HI>ad Bonifatiu~,</HI> where he sayth, <Q>that a day or two before good fryday, we vse in common speeche to say thus, To morowe or this day .ii. dayes, Christ suffered his passion. where in very dede he neuer suffered his passion but ones, and that was many yeres passed. Lykewise vpo~ Easter day we say, This day Christ rose fro~ death. where in very deede it is many hundred yeres sithens he rose fro~ death Why than do not menne reproue vs as lyers, when we speake in this sort? But because we cal these dayes so, by a similitude of those dayes, wherein these thynges were done in deede. And so it is called that day, whiche is not that day in dede, but by the course of the yere is a like day. And suche thinges be sayd to bee done that day, for y^e solemne celebracion of the sacrame~t, which thinges in dede were not done that day, but lo~g before. Was Christ offereed any more but ones?
<PB REF="70">
And he offered him selfe, &amp; yet in a sacrament or representacion, not onely euery solemne feast of Easter, but euery day he is offered to the people, so that he doth not lye, that saith, he is euery day offered. For if sacramentes had not some simili|tude or likenes of those thynges, whereof they be sacramentes, they could in no wyse bee sacra|mentes. And for their similitude and lykenes, commonly they haue the name of the thynges, whereof they bee sacrame~tes. Therfore as <HI>after a certayne maner of speeche, the sacrament of Chri|stes body, is Christes body: the sacrament of Christes bloud, is Christes bloud</HI>: so lykewise the sacrame~t of fayth, is fayth. And to beleue is nothyng els, but to haue fayth: And therfore whe~ we answere for yong children in their baptisme, that thei be|leue, whiche haue not yet the mynd to beleue, we answere that they haue fayth, because they haue the sacrame~t of fayth. And we say also that they turne vnto God, because of the sacrament of the co~uersion vnto God, for that answer partaineth to the celebracion of the sacrament. And like|wyse speaketh the Apostle of Baptisme, saiyng: that by Baptisme wee bee buryed with him into death: <HI>he sayth not, that wee signifie burial, but he sayth plainly, that we be buried.</HI> So that the sacra|ment of so great a thing, is not called but by the name of the thyng it selfe.</Q></P>
<P>Hytherto I haue rehersed the answere of S. Augustine vnto Boniface a learned Byshoppe, who asked of him, howe the parentes &amp; frendes
<PB N="65" REF="70">
coulde answere for a yong babe in baptisme, and saye in his person, that he beleueth and conuer|teth vnto God, when the childe can neither doo nor thinke any suche thinge.</P>
<P>Whervnto the answere of S. Augustine is this that for as muche as baptisme is the sacramente of the profession of our faith, and of our conuer|sion vnto God, it becometh vs so to answere for yong children comming thervnto, as to that sa|crament appertaineth, although the children in deede haue no knowledge of suche thinges.</P>
<P>And yet in our said answeres we ought not to be reprehended as vain men or liers, forasmuche as in co~mon speche we vse daily to cal sacrame~ts and figures by the names of the things that be signified by them, although thei be not the same thing in dede. As euery Good fryday (as ofte~ as it returneth from yere to yere) we cal it the dai of Christes passion: and euery Easter daye, we call the day of his resurrection: and euery day in the yeare, we saye that Christe is offered: and the sa|crament of his body, we call it his body: and the sacrame~t of his blud, we cal it his blud: and our baptism S. Paul calleth our burial with Christ And yet in very deede Christe neuer suffered but ones, neuer arose but ones, neuer was offered but ones, nor in very dede in baptisme we be not buried, nor the sacrament of Christs body is not his bodye, nor the sacrament of his bloud is not his bloud. But so they be called, bycause they be figures, sacraments, and representacions of the thinges theym selfe whiche they signifye, and
<PB REF="71">
whereof they beare the name.</P>
<P>Thus doth S. Augustine most plainly open this matter in his epistle to Bonifacius.</P>
<P>Of this maner of speache (wherein a signe is called by the name of the thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er Leui. quest.</HI> 57.</NOTE> which it signifi|eth) speaketh S. Augustine also right largly in his questions <HI>super Leuiticum, &amp; contra Adaman|tium,</HI> declaring how bloud in scripture is called the soule.<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leui. 17.</NOTE> <HI>A thing which signifieth</HI> (saith he) <HI>is wont to be called by the name of the thing whiche it signifi|eth,</HI> as it is written in the scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Be. 41.</NOTE> The vii. ea|res be vii. yeares.

Cor. 2.</NOTE> And so saide S. Paule, that <HI>the stone was Christe,</HI> and not that it signified Christ, but euen as it had bin he in deed, which neuerthe+les <HI>was not Christ by substance, but by significacio~.</HI> Euen so (saith S. August.) bicause the bloud si+gnifieth &amp; representeth the soul, therfore in a sa|cramente or significacion it is called the sowle.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Co~tra A|damantiu~ cap.</HI> 12. <HI>Leui.</HI> 17</NOTE><HI>And</HI> Co~tra Adamantiu~ <HI>he writeth much like, say+ing:</HI><Q><HI> In such wise is blud y^e soule, as</HI> the stone was Christ, <HI>&amp; yet</HI> thapostle saith nor, that the stone signifi|ed Christ, but saith it was Christ. <HI>And this sentence,</HI> Bloud is the soule. <HI>may be vnderstand to be spoke~ in a signe or figure, for</HI> Christ did not stick to say, This is my body. when he gaue the signe of his body.</Q></P>
<P>Here S. Augustine rehersing diuers senten|ces, which were spoken figuratiuely, that is to saye, whan one thinge was called by the name of an other, and yet was not the other in substance
<PB N="66" REF="71">
but in significacion, as that bludde is the soule: vii. kyne be vii. yeares: vii. eares be vii. yeares: the stone was Christe. Amonge suche maner of speeches, he reherseth those words which Christ spake at his laste supper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 26</NOTE> This is my bodye, whiche declareth plainly S. Augustines mynd, that Christ spake those woordes figuratyuelye, not meaning that the breade was hys bodye by substaunce, but by signifycacion.</P>
<P>And therfore S. Augustine saith <HI>Contra Ma|ximinu~,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Contra Ma+ximinu~. li.</HI> 3 <HI>cap.</HI> 22.</NOTE> that in sacraments we must not considre what they be, but what they signifye. For thet be signes of things, beyng one thyng and signyfi|yng an other.
Whych he doth shew specyally of thys sacrament saying:<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In lib. sente~|tiarum Pro|speri de co~s|crat. distin.</HI> 4. <HI>hoc est.</HI></NOTE> <HI>The heauenly bread which is Christes flesh, by some manner of speache is called Christes body, when in very deede it is the sacrament of his body.</HI> And that offering of the flesh whiche is doone by the priestes handes, is called Chri|stes passion, deathe and crucifiyng, not in very deede, but in a mystycall signyfycacion.</Q></P>
<P>And to this purpose it ys both pleasaunt,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Theodoret, in dialogis.</HI></NOTE> com+fortable and profytable to reade Theodoretus, in hys Dyaloges, wher he dysputeth &amp; sheweth at length, how the names of thyngs be changed in scrypture, and yet thynges remayne styll.

<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiue prin|cipall thin+ges to bee noted in Theodo|retus.</NOTE> that our sauiour Christe in his last sup|per, when he gaue breade and wyne to his apo|stles, (sayeuge: This is my bodye, This is my bloud) it was bread which he called his body, &amp; wyne myxed in the cuppe, whyche he called his bloud: so that he changed the names of the bread and wine (which were the misteries, sacraments, signes, figures &amp; tokens of Christes fleshe and bloude) &amp; called them by the names of the thin|ges, which they dyd represent and signifie, that is to say, the breade he called by the name of his very fleshe, &amp; the wyne by the name of his blud.</P>
<P>Second, that although the names of breade and wyne were changed after sanctification, yet neuerthelesse the thyngs them selues remayned the selfe same, that they were before the sanctifi|cation, that is to say, the same breade and wyne in nature, substance, forme and fashion.</P>
<P>The thyrde, seynge that the substance of the
<PB REF="76">
bread and wyne be not chaunged, why bee then their names changed? and the bread called Chri+stes flesh, and the wyne his bloud? Theodore|tus sheweth, that the cause therof was this, that we shuld not haue so muche respect to the breade and wyne (whiche we see with our eies, and tast with our mouthes) as we shuld haue to Christe hym selfe, in whom we beleue with our hertes, &amp; fele and tast him by our faith, &amp; with whose flesh and bloud (by his grace) we beleue that we bee spiritually fedde and nouryshed.</P>
<P>These thynges we ought to remembre and re|uolue in our myndes, and to lyfte vp our hartes from the bread and wine vnto Christ that sytteth aboue. And bicause we shuld so do, therfore after the consecration, they be no more called bread &amp; wyne, but the body and bloud of Christe.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4"> The fourth. It is in these sacraments of bread and wyne, as it is in the very bodye of Christe. For as the body of Christe before his resurrecti|on, and after, is al one in nature, substance, big|nesse, forme and fashion, and yet it is not called as an other co~mon body, but with addition, for the dignitee of his exaltation, it is called a hea|uenly, a godly, an immortal, and the Lords bo|dy: so lykewyse the breade and wyne, before the consecration and after, is all one in nature, sub|stance, bygnesse, forme, and fashion, and yet it is not called as other common bread, but for the dignitee, whervnto it is taken, it is called with addition, Heauenly breade, the breade of lyfe,
<PB N="71" REF="76">
and the bread of thankes gyuyng.</P>
<P>The fift, that no man ought to be so arrogant <MILESTONE N="5"> and presumptuous to affirme for a certayn truth in religion any thynge, whiche is not spoken of in holy scripture. And this is spoke~ to the great and vtter condemnation of the Papistes, which make and vnmake newe articles of oure faithe from tyme to tyme, at their pleasure, without a|ny scripture at all, yea quite and cleane contra|ry to scripture. And yet wyll they haue all men bounde to beleue what so euer they inuent, vpon peryll of damnation and euerlastyng fyre.</P>
<P>And they woulde constrayne with fyre and fa|gotte all men to consent (contrary to the many|fest woordes of God) to these their erroures in this matter of the holy sacramente of Christes body and bloude.</P>
<P>Fyrst that there remaineth no bread nor wyne after the consecration, but that Christes fleshe and bloud is made of them.</P>
<P>Seconde, that Christes body is really, corpo|rally, substancially, sensibly and naturally in the bread and wyne.</P>
<P>Thyrdely, that wycked persones doo eate and drynke Christes very body and bloude.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that priestes offer Christ euery day, make of him a new sacrifice propiciatory for syn.</P>
<P>Thus for shortnes of tyme, do I make an end of Theodoretus, with other olde auncient wri|ters, which do moste clerely affirme, that to eate Christes body, and to drynke his bloude, be fi|guratiue
<PB REF="77">

<P>After thesame sort the mystery of our redemp|tion, and the passion of our sauiour Christ vpon the crosse, aswel in the newe, as in the old Testa|ment, is expressed and declared by many fygu|res and figuratiue speeches.</P>

And the same he confirmed the nexte daie with his owne bloud and death.</P>
<P>And leste we should forget the same, he ordey|ned not a yerely memory (as the Paschall lambe was eaten but ones euery yere) but a dayely re|membrance he ordained therof in bread &amp; wyne, sanctified and dedicated to that purpose, saiyng:
<Q>This is my body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 26</NOTE> This cuppe is my bloud, whi|che is shed for the remission of synnes. Do this in the remembrance of me.</Q>
Admonyshyng vs by these wordes, spoken at the makyng of his laste wyll and testament, and at his departyng out of the worlde (bycause they should be the better re|memored) that whensoeuer we do eate the bread in his holy supper, and drynke of that cup, wee should remembre howe muche Christ hath done for vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What fy|guratiue speaches were vsed at Christs last supper</NOTE> And why shulde any man thinke it strange, to admit a figure in these speches, This is my bo|dy, This is my bloude? seyng that the co~muni|cation the same nyghte (by the Papistes owne confessions) was so full of figuratiue speeches?
For the Apostles spake figuratiuely whan they asked Christ,<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 26 Mat. 14 Luc. 22.</NOTE> where he would eate his passeouer or passeby. And Christe hym selfe vsed the same figure, when he sayd: I haue muche desyred to eate this passeouer with you.</Q></P>

<P>And when Christe sayde,<Q> This cup is a newe testament in my bloude. </Q>here in one sentence bee two figures.
One in this worde Cup, whych is not taken for the cup it selfe, but for the thynge conteyned in the cup. An other is in this worde, Testament, for neyther the cuppe, nor the wyne contained in the cuppe, is Christes Testament, but is a token, signe and figure, whereby is re|presented vnto vs his Testament, confirmed by his bloudde.</P>
<P>And if the Papists wil say (as thei say in dede) that by this cup, is neither ment the cup nor the wine conteyned in the cuppe, but that therby is ment Christes bloud contained in the cuppe: yet must they nedes graunt, that there is a fygure. For Christes bloude is not in proper speche, the New testame~t, but it is the thyng that co~firmed the new testament. And yet by this strange inter+pretation, the Papistes make a very straunge speche, more strange then any figuratiue speche is. For this they make the sentence: This bloud is a newe testament in my bloud. Which saiyng is so fonde and so farre from all reason, that the foolyshenes therof is euident to euery man.</P>

<P>The seconde is, that the bread oughte not to be reserued and hanged vp, as the Papistes e|uery where doo vse.</P>
<P>The third is, that the priests ought not to re|ceyue the sacrament alone (as the Papistes com+monly do, makyng a sale therof vnto the people) but they ought to co~municate with the people.</P>
<P>And here it is diligently to bee noted, that we ought not vnreuerently and vnaduisedly to ap|proche vnto the meate of the Lordes table, as we doo to other common meates and drynkes, but with great feare and dreade: least we shulde come to that holy table vnworthely, wherein is not onely represented, but also spirytually ge|uen vnto vs very <HI>CHRISTE</HI> hym selfe.

And although the bread and wyne bee the figures, signes, and tokens of Christes fleshe and bloud (as sainct Dionyse calleth them bothe before the consecracion and after) yet the Greke annotations vpon the same Dionyse do say, that the very thynges them selfes be aboue in heauen.</P>

<P>And this sacryfyce of Christe vpon the crosse, was that oblation whyche Cypriane saithe was figured and signifyed before it was done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 9. Gen. 14.</NOTE> by the wyne whiche Noe dranke, and by the breade
<PB REF="84">
and wyne whiche Melchisedech gaue to Abra|ham, and by many other figures which Cyprian there reherseth.</P>
<P>And nowe when Christe is come, and hath ac|complished that sacrifice, the same is figured, si|gnified, and represented vnto vs, by that bread and wine, which faithfull people receaue daylye in the holy communion. Wherein lyke as wyth their mouths carnally thei eat the bread &amp; drink the wyne, so by their faithe spiritually they eate Christes very fleshe and drinke his very bloode. And herby it appeareth that S. Cyprian clear|ly affirmeth the moste true doctrine, and is who|ly vpon oure side.</P>
<P>And against the Papistes hee teacheth moste plainly, that the communion ought to be recea+ued of all men vnder bothe the kindes: and that <HI>CHRIST</HI> called breade his body, and wyne hys bloude: and that there is no transubstantiation (but that breade remaineth there as a figure, to represent Christes body, and wine to represente his blud) and that those whyche bee not y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lyue|ly membres of Christe, doo eate the breade and drynke the wyne, and bee nouryshed by theym, but the verye fleshe and bludde of <HI>CHRIST,</HI> they neyther eate nor drinke.</P>
<P>Thus haue you hearde declared the mynde of Saint Cyprian.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The aun|swere to <HI>Hylarius.</HI> 8. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> trinitate</HI></NOTE>But Hylarius (thynke they) is plainest for theym in this matter, whose woordes they tran+slate thus.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="84">
<Q>If the worde was made verely fleshe, &amp; we vere|ly receiue the worde beyng fleshe, in our Lordes meate, <HI>howe shall not Christ be thought to dwel na|turally in vs</HI>? who beyng borne man, hath taken vnto him the nature of our fleshe, that can not be seuered, and hath put together the nature of his fleshe to the nature of his eternitee, vnder the sacrament of the communion of his fleshe vnto vs. For so wee bee all one, because the fa|ther is in Christe, and <HI>Christe in vs.</HI> Wherfore whosoeuer will denye the father to be naturally in Christe, he muste denye fyrste either him selfe to be naturally in Christ, or <HI>Christ to be natural|ly in him.</HI> For the beyng of the father in Christe, and <HI>the beyng of Christ in vs,</HI> maketh vs to be one in them. And therfore if Christ haue taken veri|ly the fleshe of our body, and the man that was verely borne of the virgyn Mary is Christ, and also <HI>we receiue vnder the true mysterye the fleshe of his body,</HI> by meanes whereof wee shall bee one (for the father is in Christ, and <HI>Christ in vs</HI>) how shall that be called the vnitee of wylle, when <HI>the naturall propertie brought to passe by the sacrament,</HI> is the sacrament of vnitee?</Q></P>
<P>Thus doth the Papistes (the aduersaries of Gods woorde and of his trueth) allege the au|thoritee of Hilarius (either peruersely and pur|posely, as it seemeth, vntruely cityng him, and wrastyng his wordes to their purpose) or els not truely vnderstandyng him.</P>
<P>For although he sayth that Christe is natu|rally
<PB REF="85">
in vs, yet he sayth also that we be natural|ly in him. And neuerthelesse in so saiyng, he ment not of the natural and corporal presence of the substance of Christes body &amp; of ours (for as oure bodyes bee not after that sorte within his body, so is not his body after that sorte within our bodyes) but he ment that Christe in his in|carnacion receyued of vs a mortall nature, and vnited the same vnto his diuinitee, and so be we naturally in him.</P>
<P>And the sacramentes of Baptisme and of his holy supper (if we rightly vse the same) do moste assuredly certifye vs, that wee bee partakers of his godly nature, hauyng geuen vnto vs by him, immortalitee and life euerlastyng, &amp; so is Christ naturally in vs. And so bee wee one with Christ, and Christ with vs, not onely in wylle &amp; mynde, but also in very naturall properties.</P>
<P>And so concludeth Hilarius against Arrius, that Christe is one with his father, not in pur|pose and wylle onely, but also in very nature.</P>
<P>And as the vnion betwene Christe and vs in baptisme is spiritual, and requyreth no real and corporall presence, so lykewise oure vnion with Christ in his holy supper is spiritual, and ther|fore requyreth no real and corporall presence.</P>
<P>And therfore Hilarius speaking there of both the sacramentes, maketh no difference betwene our vnion with Christ in baptisme, &amp; our vnion with him in his holy supper. And sayth further, that as Christ is in vs, so be wee in him&punc; whiche
<PB N="80" REF="85">
the Papistes can not vnderstand corporally and really, except they wyll say, that all our bodyes be corporally within Christes body. Thus is Hilarius answered vnto, both plainly &amp; shortly.</P>
<P>And this answere of Hilarius wyll serue also vnto Cyril,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The an|swere to <HI>Cyrillus.</HI></NOTE> whom they allege to speake after the same sort that Hilarius doth, that Christ is na|turally in vs. The wordes whiche they recite be these.
<Q>We denye not (sayth Cyril against the heretike) but we be spiritually ioyned to Christ, by fayth and syncere charitee: but that we shuld haue no maner of coniunction in our fleshe with Christ, that we vtterly deny, and thynke it vtter+ly discrepant from Goddes holy scriptures. For who doubteth, but Christ is so the vyne tre, &amp; we so the branches, as we get thence our life. Heare what sainct Paule sayth, Wee be all one body with Christe, for though we be many, we be one in him. All we participate in one foode. <HI>Thyn|keth this hereticke that we knowe not the strength and vertue of the mistical benediction? whiche when it is made in vs, doth it not make Christ by co~muni|cation of his fleshe to dwell corporally in vs?</HI> Why be the membres of faythful mens bodyes called the membres of Christe?<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Cor. 6.</NOTE> Knowe you not (sayth sainct Paule) that your membres be the mem|bres of Christ? And shall I make the membres of Christ, partes of the whoores body? God for|byd. And our sauiour also sayth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 6.</NOTE> He that eateth my fleshe and drynketh my bloud, <HI>dwelleth in me</HI> and I in him.</Q></P>
<P><PB REF="86">Although in these wordes Cyril doth say, that Christ doth dwell corporally in vs, whan we re|ceiue y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mistical benediction: yet he neither sayth that Christ dwelleth corporally in the bread, nor that he dwelleth in vs corporally onely at suche tymes as wee receiue the sacrament, nor that he dwelleth in vs, &amp; not we in him, but he sayth as|wel, y^t we dwel in him, as that he dwelleth in vs. Whiche dwellyng is neither corporal nor local, but an heauenly, spiritual &amp; supernatural dwel|lyng, wherby so long as we dwell in him &amp; he in vs, we haue by him euerlastyng life. And ther|fore Cyril sayth in the same place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ihon. 15.</NOTE> that Christ is the vyne, and wee the braunches, because that by him wee haue life. For as the braunches re|ceiue lyfe and nourishement of the body of the vyne, so receiue we by him the natural propertie of his body, whiche is life and immortalitee, &amp; by that meanes we beyng his membres, do liue, and are spiritually norished.</P>
<P>And this ment Cyril by this worde <HI>Corporal|ly,</HI> when he sayth, that Christ dwelleth corporal|ly in vs. And the same ment also sainct Hilarius by this woorde <HI>Naturally,</HI> whan he sayd that Christ dwelleth naturally in vs. And as sainct Paule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colloss. 2.</NOTE> whan he sayd that in Christ dwelleth the full diuinitee <HI>Corporally,</HI> by this worde <HI>Corpo|rally,</HI> he ment not that the diuinitee is a body, &amp; so by that body dwelleth bodely in Christ. But by this worde <HI>Corporally,</HI> he ment that the diui|nitee is not in Christ accidentally, lightly and
<PB N="81" REF="86">
slenderly, but substantially and perfectely, wyth all hys mighte and power: so that <HI>CHRIST</HI> was not onely a mortall manne, to suffre for vs, but also hee was immortall God, able to redeeme vs.</P>
<P>So S. Cyril, whan he sayd that Christ is in vs <HI>corporally,</HI> he mente that we haue him in vs, not lightly and to small effecte and purpose, but that we haue him in vs substantially, pythelye, and effectually, in suche wise, that wee haue by hym redemption and euerlastinge lyfe.</P>
<P>And this I sucke not out of myne owne fyn|gers,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Ioha~. li~b.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 17</NOTE> but haue it of Cyrils owne expresse words,
where he saith: <Q>A lyttle benediction draweth the whole manne to god, and filleth him with grace and <HI>after this manner Christe dwelleth in vs,</HI> and we in <HI>CHRIST.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But as for corporall eatinge and drinkinge with our mouths, and digesting with our bodies Cyril neuer ment that Christ doth so dwel in vs, as he plainly declareth.</P>
<P><Q>Our sacrament (saith he) doth not affirme the eatinge of a manne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An athema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tismo.</HI> 11.</NOTE> drawynge wickedly christen people to haue grosse imaginacions and carnal fantasies of suche thinges as be fine and pure, &amp; receiued <HI>onely with a sincere faithe.</HI> But as twoo waxes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Ioha~.

<PB REF="87">
in him, and he in Christ.</HI></Q></P>
<P>By these wordes of Cyril appeareth his mind plainly, that wee maye not grossely and rudelye thinke of the eating of Christ with our mouths, but with our faith, by which eatinge (although he be absente hence bodely and be in the eternall life and glorye with his father) yet we bee made partakers of hys nature, to bee immortal, and haue eternall lyfe and glorye with him.</P>
<P>And thus is declared the minde aswell of Cy|ryll as of Hylarius.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Basilius. Nissenus &amp; Nazianze|nus.</HI></NOTE> And here may be wel enough passed ouer Ba|silius, Gregorius Nissenus and Gregorius Na+zianzenus, partely bycause they speake lyttle of this mattier, and partely bycause they maye bee easyly aunswered vnto, by that which is, before declared and often repeted, whiche is that a fy|gure hath the name of the thing wherof it is the figure, and therefore of the fygure maye be spo|ken the same thinge, that maye be spoken of the thynge it selfe.</P>
<P>And as concerninge the eatinge of Christes fleshe and drinkinge of his bludde, they spake of the spirituall eatinge and drinkinge thereof by faith, and not of corporall eating and drnkinge with the mouth and teethe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The aun|swere to E+missenus.</NOTE>Likewise Eusebius Emissenus is shortly an|swered vnto, for he speaketh not of any real and corporall conuersion of breade and wyne into Christes body and bludde, nor of any corporall and reall eating and drinkinge of the same, but
<PB N="82" REF="87">
hee speaketh of a sacramentall conuersion of bread and wyne, and of a spirituall eatinge and drynkyng of the body and bloode. After whiche sorte, Christe is as well present in baptisme (as the same Eusebius plainly there declareth) as he is in the Lordes table. Which is not carnal|ly and corporally, but by faithe and spiritually. But of thys authour is spoken beefore more at large in the matter of transubstantiation. fo. 24.</P>
<P>And now I wyll come to the saying of S. Am+brose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The aun|swere to <HI>Ambrosius de sacrame~+tis libro.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> whiche is alwaies in their mouthes.
<Q>Be|fore the consecration saith he (as they allege) it is bread, but after the woordes of consecration it is the body of Chryste.</Q></P>
<P>For answere herevnto, yt muste be fyrste kno|wen what Consecration is.</P>
<P>Consecration is the separation of anye thing from a prophane and wordely vse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Consecrati+on.</NOTE> vnto a spiri|tuall and godly vse.</P>
<P>And therfore whan vsual and common water is taken frome other vses, and put to the vse of baptisme in the name of the father and of the sonne, and of the holy ghost, than it may right|ly be called Consecrated water, that is to saye, water put to an holy vse.</P>
<P>Euen so whan co~mon bread &amp; wine be taken &amp; seuered fro~ other bread and wyne, to the vse of y^e holy co~munion, that portion of bread and wyne, although it be of the same substance that the o|ther is, fro~ the whych it is seuered, yet it is nowe called consecrated or holy bread, and holy wyne.</P>
<P><PB REF="88">Not that the bread and wine haue or can haue any holynes in them, but that they be vsed to an holy worke, and represent holy &amp; godly thinges. And therfore S. Dionyse calleth the breade,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De eccl Hie rar. cap.</HI> 3.</NOTE> ho|ly breade, and the cuppe an holy cuppe, as soone as they bee sette vppon the aultate to the vse of the holy communion.</P>
<P>But specially they maye be called holye and consecrated, when they be separated to that ho|ly vse of Christes owne wordes, whiche he spake for that purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 26 Mat. 14. Luc. 22.</NOTE> saying of the breade: This is my body, And of the wyne: This is my bloude.</P>
<P>So that commonly the authors, before those wordes be spoken, do take the breade and wyne but as other common bread and wine, but after those woordes be pronounced ouer theym, than they take theym for consecrated and holy breade and wyne.</P>
<P>Not that the bread and wine can be partakers of any holynes or godlynesse, or can be the body and bloode of Christ, but that they represent the very bodye and bloude of Christe, and the holy foode and nourishement, which we haue by him, And so thei be called by the names of the body &amp; bloud of Christ, as the signe, token and figure is called by the name of the very thinge, whiche it sheweth and signifieth.</P>
<P>And therefore as S. Ambrose in the wordes before cited by the aduersaries, saith, that bee|fore the consecration, it is bread, and after the co~+secration, it is Christes body: so in other places
<PB N="83" REF="88">
he dothe more plainly sette forth his meaninge, saying these wordes:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De his qui mysterijs ini cia~tur ca. ul.</HI></NOTE>
<Q>Before the benediction of the heauenly wordes, it is called an other kinde of thinge, but <HI>after the consecration, is signified</HI> the body of Christ. Likewise before the consecration it is called an other thing, but <HI>after the consecra|tion it is named</HI> the bludde of Christe.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De sacrame~+tis libro.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> And again he saith: When I treated of the sacramentes, I tolde you that that thinge whiche is offered be|fore the woordes of Christ, is called Bread, but when the wordes of Christ be pronounced, than it is not called bread, but it is <HI>called</HI> by the name of Christes body.</Q></P>
<P>By whiche woordes of S. Ambrose, it appe|reth plainly, that the bread is called by the name of Christes body after the consecration, and al|though it be styll bread, yet after consecration it is dignyfyed by the name of the thing, whych it representeth, as at lengthe is declared before in the proces of transubstantiation, and speciallye in the woordes of Theodoretus.</P>
<P>And as the bread is a corporal meat,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De sacrame~+tis lib.</HI> 6. <HI>ca.</HI> 1.</NOTE> and cor|porally eaten, so saith S. Ambrose, is the bodye of Christe a spirituall meate, and spiritually ea|ten, and that requireth no corporall presence.</P>
<P>Now let vs examine S. Iohn Chrysostome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The aun|swere to Chrysosto+mus.</NOTE> who in sounde of woordes, maketh moste for the aduersaries of the truthe: but they that bee fa|milyar and acquainted with Chrysostomes ma|ner of speaking (how in all his writinges hee is full of allusions, schemes, tropes and figures,
<PB REF="89">
shall soone perceyue, that he healpeth nothyng their purposes, as it shal wel appeare by the dis|cussyng of those places, whiche the Papistes do allege of him, whiche bee specially two. One is <HI>in sermone de Eucharistia in Encaenijs.</HI> And the other is <HI>De perditione Iudae.</HI></P>
<P>And as touchyng the first, no ma~ can speake more plainly against them, than sainct Iohn Chrysostome speaketh in that sermone. Where|fore it is to be wo~dered, why they should allege him for their partie, vnlesse they be so blynde in their opinion, that they can see nothyng, nor de|cerne what maketh for them, nor what against them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> sermone de Eucha|ristia in Encaenijs.</HI></NOTE> For there he hath these woordes.
<Q>Whan you comme to these mysteries (speakyng of the Lordes boorde and holy Communion) <HI>do not thynke that you receyue by a man the body of God,</HI> meanyng of Christe. </Q>These bee S. Ihon Chry|sostome his owne wordes in that place.</P>
<P>Than if we receiue not the body of Christe at the handes of a man, <HI>Ergo,</HI> the body of Christ is not really, corporally and naturally in the sacra+ment, and so geuen to vs by the priest. And than it foloweth, that all the Papistes bee lyars, be|cause they fayue and teache the contrary.</P>
<P>But this place of Chrysostome is touched be+fore more at length in answeryng to the Papi|stes Transubstantiation.</P>
<P>Wherfore nowe shall be answered the other place whiche the allege of Chrysostome in these wordes.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rdi|tione Iudae.</HI></NOTE>
<Q>Here he is present in the sacrament and
<PB N="84" REF="89">
dothe consecrate, whiche garnished the table at the maundy or last supper. For <HI>it is not man, whi|che maketh of the bread and wyne,</HI> beyng set furth to be consecrated, <HI>the body and bloud of Christe, but it is Christe him selfe</HI>: (whiche for vs is cruci|fyed) <HI>that maketh him selfe to bee there present. The wordes are vttered and pronounced by the mouthe of the priest, but the consecration is by the vertue, myght, and grace of God hym selfe.</HI> And as this saying of God (Increase,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genes. 1.</NOTE> be multiplied, and fyl the yearth) ones spoken by God, toke alwayes effect towarde generation. Euen so <HI>the saiyng of Christe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 26 Marc. 14 Luc. 22.</NOTE> <HI>This is my bodye&punc; beyng but ones spoken, doth throughout all churches to this present, and shall to his last commyng, geue force and strength to this sacrifice.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus farre they reherse of Chrysostomes wordes. Whiche woordes although they sound muche for their purpose, yet if they be through|ly considered, and co~ferred with other places of the same author, it shall well appeare, that he mente nothyng lesse, than that Christes bodye should be corporally and naturally prese~t in the bread and wyne, but that in suche sorte he is in heauen only, and in our myndes by fayth we a|scend vp into heauen, to eat him there, although sacramentally as in a signe and figure, he be in the bread and wyne (and so is he also in the wa|ter of Baptisme) &amp; in theim that rightly receiue the bread &amp; wyne, he is in a much more perfectio~ than corporally (whiche should auayle them no|thyng)
<PB REF="90">
but in them he is spiritually with his di|uine power, geuing them eternall lyfe.</P>
<P>And as in the first creation of the world, al ly|uyng creatures had their first life by gods only word. (for god only spake his word, and al thin|ges were created by and by accordingly) and af|ter their creation hee spake these woordes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genes. 1.</NOTE> In|crease and multiply&punc; and by the vertue of those wordes, al thinges haue gendred and increaced euer sithens that tyme: euen so after that Christe sayd;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 26 Marc. 14 Luc. 22.</NOTE> Eate, this is my body. &amp; Drink, this is my bloud, Do this hereafter in remembrance of me. by vertu of these words, and not by vertu of any man, the bread and wine be so consecrated, that who so euer with a lyuely faithe dothe eate that bread and drink that wine, doth spiritually eate, drynke and feede vpon Christe, syttynge in hea|uen with his father. And this is the whole mea|nynge of S. Chrysostome.</P>
<P>And therefore dooeth hee so often saye, that wee receaue Christe in baptisme, and whanne he hathe spoken of the receauinge of hym in the holy Communion, by and by he speaketh of the receauing of him in baptisme, withoute decla|rynge any diuersytee of his presence in the one, from his presence in the other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ad populu~ Antiochenu~ hom.</HI> 61. <HI>&amp; in Ioannem hom.</HI> 45.</NOTE>He saieth also in many places, that we <HI>ascende into heauen, and do eate Christe sittinge there aboue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AND</HI> where S. Chrysostome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd other Au|thors doo speake of the wonderfull operation of God in his sacramentes, passynge all mannes
<PB N="85" REF="90">
wytte, senses, and reason, he meaneth not of the workyng of God in the water, bread and wyne, but of the meruaylous workyng of God in the hartes of them that receaue the sacramentes, se|cretely, inwardly, and spiritually transformyng them, renuyng, fedyng, comfortyng and nouri|shyng them with his fleshe and bloud, thorough his most holy spirite, the same fleshe and bloud styll remaynyng in heauen.</P>
<P>Thus is this place of Chrysostome sufficient|ly answered vnto. And yf any man requyre any more, than let hym looke what is recited of the same author before in the matter of transubstan|tiation.</P>
<P>Yet furthermore they bryng for theim Theo|philus Alexandrinus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The aun|swere to Theophi|lactus in Mat. 14.</NOTE> who (as they alledge) sai|eth thus. <Q><HI>CHRISTE</HI> gyuynge thankes, dydde breake, (which also we do) addynge therto prai|er. And he gaue vnto them, sayeng: Take, this is my body. this that I doo now gyue, and that whiche ye nowe doo take. For <HI>the breade is not a figure onely of Christes body, but it is chaunged in|to the very body of Christe.</HI> For Christ saith: The bread whiche I wyll geue you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 6.</NOTE> is my fleshe. Ne|uerthelesse the fleshe of Christ is not sene for our weakenesse, but bread and wyne ar familiar vn|to vs. And surely yf we shoulde visibly see fleshe and bloude, we coulde not abyde it. And there|fore our Lord, bearing with our weakenes, doth reteyne and keepe the forme and apparaunce of bread and wyne, but <HI>he doth tourne the very bread
<PB REF="91">
and wyne into the very fleshe and bloude of Christe.</HI></Q></P>
<P>These be the wordes whyche the Papistes do cite out of Theophilus vpon the gospel of saint Marke. But by this one place it appeereth eui|dently, either howe negligente the Papistes bee in serchyng out and examynyng the saiynges of the authors, which they allege for their purpose, or els howe false and deceytfull they be, whyche willyngly and wittyngly haue made in this one place, and as it were with one breath, two loude and shamefull lyes.</P>
<P>The first is, that bycause they wolde geue the more authorite to the woordes by them alleged, they (like fals Potycaties that sell <HI>quid pro quo</HI>) falsifie the authors name, fatherynge suche say|enges vpon Theophilus Alexandrinus, an olde and auncient author, whiche were in dede none of his wordes, but wer the wordes of Theophi|lactus, who was many yeres after Theophilus Alexandrinus. But suche hathe euer been the Papisticall subtiltees, to set forth their owne in|uentions, dreames, and lyes, vnder the name of antiquitee and auncient Authors</P>
<P>The second lye or falshod is, that thei falsifie the authors wordes and meanyng, subuertynge the truth of his doctrine. For where Theophy|lactus (accordynge to the catholike doctrine of auncient authors) sayth, that almightie God (co~+desce~dyng to our infirmitee) reserueth the kynde of bread &amp; wyne, and yet tourneth them into the <HI>vertue</HI> of Christes fleshe and bloud: They saye
<PB N="74" REF="91">
that he reserueth the formes and apparances of bread &amp; wyne, and turneth them into the Uerite of his fleshe and bloud. so tornyng and alteryng kyndes into fourmes and apparances, and <HI>ver|tue</HI> into Ueritee, that of the vertue of the fleshe and bloud, thei make the veritee of his flesh and bloud. And thus haue they falsified as well the name as the wordes of Theophilactus, turnyng veritee into playne and flatte falsitee.</P>

<P>And although Theophylactus spake of the eatyng of the very body of Christ, and the drin|kyng of his very bloud, (and not only of the fi|gures of them) and of the co~uersion of the bread and wyne into the body and bloud of Christ, yet he meaneth not of a grosse, carnal, corporall, and sensible conuersion of the breade and wyne, nor of a lyke eatyng and drynkynge of his fleshe and bloud (for so not only our stomakes wold yerne and oure heartes abhorre to eate his fleshe and to drynke his bloude, but also suche eatyng and drynkynge could nothyng profit and auayle vs)

but he spake of the celestial and spiritual eatyng of Christ, and of a sacramental conuersion of the bread, callyng the bread not onely a figure, but also the bodye of Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, geuynge vs by those woordes to vnderstande, that in the sacramente wee not onely eate corporally the bread (whyche is a sacrament and figure of Christes body) but spiritually we eate also his very body, &amp; drynke his very bloud.

<P><Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">The aun+swere to <HI>Hierony|mus super Epistoad Titum.</HI></NOTE>Besides this, our aduersaries doo allege saint Hierome vpon the Epistle <HI>ad Titum,</HI> that there is as great difference betwene the loaues called <HI>Panes propositionis,</HI> and the body of Christe, as there is betwene a shadowe of a bodye, and the body it selfe, and as there is betwene an ymage and the thyng it self, and betwene an example of thynges to come, and the thynges that be prefi|gured by them.</Q></P>
<P>These wordes of saincte Hierome truely vn|derstand, serue nothyng for thentent of the Pa|pistes.

For he is but a yonge newe author in the respect of those which we haue brought in for our party And in diuers pointes he varieth fro~ the most an+cient authors (if he meane as thei expound him) as when he saith, that the bread and wine be not figures, which all the old authors call figures, and that the bread and wyne consume not, nor be auoyded downewarde, which Origen and S. Augustine affirme, or that they be not called the examples of Christes body after the consecrati|on, whiche shall manyfestely appere false by the Liturgy ascribed vnto S. Basill.</P>
<P>And moreouer, the sayde Damascene was one of the byshoppe of Romes chiefe proctoures a|gainst the Emperours, and as it were his ryght
<PB REF="93">
hande, to set abroade all ydolatrye by his owne handewrytynge. And therefore yf he loste his hande (as they saye he dyd) he lost it by Goddes moste righteous iudgemente, what soeuer they faine and fable of the miraculous restitution of the same. And yet what so euer the sayd Dama|scene writeth in other mattiers, surely in this place wiche the aduersaries doo alledge, he wri|teth spiritually and godly, although the Papi|stes either of ignorance mystake hym, or els wil|lyngly wraste him and writhe hym to their pur|pose, cleane contrary to his meanynge.</P>
<P>The sum of Damascene his doctrine in this matter is this. That as Christ beyng both God &amp; man hath in him two natures, so hath he twoo natiuitees, one eternal, &amp; thother temporall. And so lykewise we (beyng as it were double men, or hauyng euery one of vs two men in vs, the new man &amp; the old man, the spirituall man &amp; the car|nall man) haue a double natiuitee: One of oure first carnall father Adam (by whom as by anci|ent inheritance cometh vnto vs malediction and euerlastyng damnation) &amp; the other of our hea|uenly Adam, that is to saye, of Christ, by whom we be made heires of celestiall benediction, and euerlastyng glory and immortalitee.</P>
<P>And bycause this Adam is spirituall, therefore our generation by hym muste be spirituall, &amp; our feedyng muste bee lykewise spirituall. And our spirituall generation by hym is playnly set forth in baptisme, and our spirituall meate and foode
<PB N="76" REF="93">
is set foorth in the holy Co~munion &amp; supper of the Lorde. And because our sightes bee so feble that we cannot see the spiritual water wherwith we be washed in baptisme, nor the spiritual meat wherwith we be fedde at the Lordes table, ther|fore to healpe oure infirmities, and to make vs the better to see the same with a pure fayth, our sauiour Christ hath set furth the same, as it were before our eyes, by sensible signes and tokens, whiche we be daily vsed and accustomed vnto.</P>
<P>And because the common custome of men is to washe in water, therfore our spiritual regene|ration in Christe, or spirituall washyng in his blud, is declared vnto vs in baptisme by water. Lykewise oure spiritual norishement &amp; feadyng in Christ, is sette before oure eyes by bread and wyne, because they be meates and drynkes whi|che chiefly and vsually we be fedde withal, that as they feade the body, so doth Christe with his fleshe and bloud spiritually feade the soule.</P>
<P>And therefore the bread and wyne bee called examples of Christes fleshe and bloud, and also they be called his very fleshe and blode, to signi+fie vnto vs, that as they feade vs carnally, so do they admonishe vs that Christe with his fleshe and bloud doth feade vs spiritually, and moste truely vnto euerlastyng life.</P>
<P>And as almyghty God by his moste myghty worde and his hollye spirite and infinite power brought forth all creatures in the begynnyng, and euer sithens hath preserued theym, euen
<PB REF="94">
so by the same worde and power he woorketh in vs from time to tyme this meruailous spiritual generation &amp; wonderfull spirituall norishment &amp; feedyng, which is wrought onely by God, and is comprehended and receiued of vs by fayth.</P>
<P>And as bread and drynke by natural norishe|ment be chaunged into a mannes body, and yet the body is not chaunged, but the same that it was before: so although the bread and wyne be sacramentally chaunged into Christes body, yet his body is the same and in the same place that it was before, that is to say, in heauen, without any alteracion of the same.</P>
<P>And the bread and wyne bee not so chaunged into the fleshe and bloud of Christ, that they bee made one nature, but they remayne styll distinct in nature, so that the bread in it selfe is not his fleshe, &amp; the wyne his bloud, but vnto them that worthely eate and drinke the bread and wyne, to them the bread and wyne be his flesh and bloud, that is to say, by thynges naturall and whiche they be accustomed vnto, they bee exalted vnto thynges aboue nature. For y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sacramental bread and wyne be not base and naked figures, but so pithy and effectuous, that whosoeuer worthely eateth them, eateth spiritually Christes fleshe and bloud, and hath by them euerlastyng life.</P>
<P>Wherfore, whosoeuer co~meth to the Lordes table, must come with all humilitee, feare, reue|rence and puritie of life, as to receiue not onely bread and wyne, but also our sauior Christ, both
<PB N="89" REF="94">
God and man, with al his benefites, to the relief and suste~tacion both of their bodies and soules.</P>
<P>This is briefly the summe and true meanyng of Damascene, concernyng this matter.</P>
<P>Wherfore they that gather of hym, either the natural presence of Christes body in the sacra|me~tes of bread and wyne, or the adoration of the outward and visible sacrament, or that after the co~secracion there remayneth no bread nor wyne nor other substaunce but onely the substaunce of the body and bloude of Christe: eyther they vn|derstand not Damascen, or els of wilful froward+nes they wyll not vnderstande hym: whyche ra|ther seemeth to bee true, by suche collections as they haue vniustly gathered &amp; noted out of him.</P>
<P>For although he say, that Christe is the spiri|tuall meate, yet as in baptisme the holy ghost is not in the water, but in hym that is vnfaynedly baptised: so Damascene ment not y^t Christ is in the bread, but in hym y^t worthily eateth the bred.</P>
<P>And though he say that the bread is Christes body, and the wyne his bloud, yet he mente not that the bread considered in it selfe, or the wyne in it selfe, beyng not receyued, is his fleshe and bloud: but to suche as by vnfayned faith woor|thely receyue the breade and wyne, to suche the breade and wyne, are called by Damascene the body and bloude of Christe, bycause that suche persons, through the workyng of the holy gost, be so knytte and vnited spirituallye to Christes fleshe and bloude, and to his diuinitee also, that
<PB REF="95">
they bee fedde with them vnto euerlastyng life.</P>
<P>Furthermore Damascene sayeth not that the sacrament should be worshipped and adored, as the Papistes terme it (whiche is playne ydola|trye) but we must worship Christ God and man. And yet we may not worship him in bread and wyne, but sittyng in heauen with his father, and beyng spiritually within our selues.</P>
<P>Nor he sayeth not, that there remayneth no bread nor wyne, nor none other substaunce, but onely the substaunce of the body and bloud of Christe: but he sayeth playnely, that as a bur|nyng coale is not wodde onely, but fyre &amp; wodde ioyned together. so the bread of the Co~munion is not bread onely, but bread ioyned to the di|uinitee. But those that say, that there is none other substance but the substa~ce of the body and bloud of Christe, doo not onely denye that there is bread and wyne, but by force they must denye also, that there is either Christes diuinitee or his soule. For if the fleshe and bloud, the soule and diuinitee of Christe bee foure substances, and in the sacrament be but two of them, that is to say, his fleshe and bloud, than where be his soule and diuinitee?
And thus these men diuide Iesus, separatyng his diuinitee from his hu|manitee. Of whom sainct Ihon sayeth,<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 4.</NOTE> Whoso+euer diuideth Iesus, is not of God, but he is Antichrist.</Q></P>
<P>And moreouer these men do so separate Chri|stes body from his membres in the sacrament,
<PB N="90" REF="95">
that they leaue hym no mans body at all. For as Damascene saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In librode duabus in Christo v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntatibus&punc;</NOTE> that the distinction of membres pertayne so muche to the nature of a mannes body, that where there is no suche distin|ction, there is no perfecte mans body.</P>
<P>But by these Papistes doctrine, there is no suche distinction of membres in the sacramente, for eyther there is no head, fete, handes, armes, legges, mouthe, eyes, and nose at all: or elles all is heade, all feete, all handes, all armes, all legges, all mouthe, all eyes, and all nose. And so they make of Christes body, no mannes bo|dye at all.</P>
<P>Thus beynge confuted the Papistes errours as well concernyng Transubstantiation, as the reall, corporall and natural presence of Christ in the sacrament, whiche were two principall poin|tes purposed in the begynnyng of this woorke. Nowe it is tyme som thyng to speke of the third errour of the Papistes, whyche is concer|nynge the eatynge of <HI>CHRISTES</HI> very bodye and drynkyng of his bloude.</P>

<P>For they say, that whoso+euer eate and drynke the sacramentes of bread and wyne, do eate and drynk al+so with their mouthes Christes very fleshe and bloud, be they neuer so vngodly and wicked per|sons.
But Christ hym selfe taughte cleane con|trary in the .vi. of Iohn, y^t we eate not hym car|nally with our mouths, but spiritually with our faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The god lye only eate Christ.</NOTE> saiyng: <Q>Uerely verely I say vnto you: he y^t beleueth in me, hath euerlasti~g life. I am y^e bread of life. Your fathers did eate Manna in the wil+dernes, and died. This is the bread that cam fro~ heauen, that <HI>who so euer shall eate therof, shall not dye.</HI> I am the liuely bread that cam from heuen, <HI>If any man eate of this bread, he shal lyue for euer.</HI> And the bread whiche I wyll geue, is my fleshe, why|che I wyll geue for the lyfe of the worlde.</Q></P>
<P>This is the moste trewe doctrine of our saui|our Christe, that who so euer eateth hym, shall haue euerlasting life. And by and by it foloweth in the same place of Iohn more cleerely.
<Q>Ueryly verely I say vnto you, except you eate the fleshe
<PB N="91" REF="96">
of the sonne of man, and drynke his bloud, you shall not haue lyfe in you.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn. 6.</NOTE> <HI>He that eateth my fleshe and drynketh my bloud, hath lyfe euerlastyng,</HI> and I wyll rayse hym agayne at the laste daye: For my fleshe is very meate, and my bloudde is very drynke, <HI>He that eateth my fleshe, and drynketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in hym.</HI> As the lyuyng father hath sente me, and I lyue by the father, e|uen so <HI>he that eateth me, shal lyue by me.</HI> This is the bread whiche came downe from heauen, not as your fathers dyd eate Manna, and are dead, <HI>he that eateth of this bread, shall lyue for euer.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This taught our sauiour Christe as well his disciples as the Iewes at Capernaum, that the eatyng of his fleshe and drynkyng of his bloude was not lyke to the eatyng of Ma~na. For both good and badde dyd eate Manna, but none do eate his fleshe and drynke his bloudde, but they haue euerlastyng lyfe. For as his father dwel|leth in hym, and he in his father, and so hathe lyfe by his father: so he that eateth Christes fleshe and drynketh his bloud, dwelleth in Christ &amp; Christ in him, &amp; by Christ he hath eternall lyfe.</P>
<P>What nede we any other witnesse? wha~ Christe hym selfe doth testifie the matter so plainly, that who so euer eateth his fleshe and drynketh his bloud, hath euerlastynge lyfe? and that to eate his fleshe and to drinke his bloud, is to beleue in hym? And who so euer beleueth in him, hath euer+lastyng lyfe. Whereof it foloweth necessaryly, that vngodly persons (beyng lymmes of the di|uell)
<PB REF="97">
do not eate Christes fleshe nor drynke his bloud, excepte the Papistes wold saie, that su|che haue euerlastyng lyfe.</P>
<P>But as the dyuell is the foode of the wycked, whiche he nourisheth in all iniquitee, and bryn|geth vp into euerlastyng da~nation: so is Christe the very fode of al them that bee the liuely mem|bres of his body, and them he norisheth, fedeth, bringeth vp and cherisheth vnto euerlasting life</P>

without colour or dissimulacion.</P>
<P>And Athanasius speakinge of the eatinge of Christes fleshe and drinking of his bloud,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Athanasius de peccato in spiritum sanctum.</HI></NOTE> sayth <Q>that for this cause he made mention of his asce~|cion into heauen, to plucke them from corporall phantasie, that thei might learne hereafter, that his fleshe was called the celestiall meate that came from aboue, and a <HI>spirituall foode</HI> which he would geue.

<P>In these woordes Athanasius declareth the cause why Christ made mention of his ascention into heauen, whan hee spake of the eatinge and drinking of his fleshe and blud. The cause after Athanasius mynde was thys, that his hearers shuld not thinke of any carnal eating of his bo|dy with their mouths (for as concerning the pre|sence of his body, he should be taken from them, and ascende into heauen, but that they shuld vn|derstande him to be a spirituall meate, and spiri+tually to be eaten, and bi that refreshing to giue eternall lyfe, which he doth to none, but to suche as be his lyuely membres.</P>
<P>And of this eatinge speaketh also Basilius,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Basilius epi|stola.</HI> 141.</NOTE> that we eate Christes flesh and drinke his blud, beynge made, by hys incarnation and sensyble

Augustine in many places plainlye discussing this mattier,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Augustinu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in sententijs ex prospero decerptis cap.</HI> 339,</NOTE> saith: <Q><HI>He that agreeth not with Christe, doeth neither eate his bodye nor drinke his bludde,</HI> although to the condemnation of hys presumptio~, he receiue euery day the sacramente of so highe a mattier.</Q></P>
<P>And moreouer S. Augustine,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Ciuitate Dei lib.</HI> 21. <HI>capite.</HI> 25</NOTE> most plainly re+solueth this matter in his booke <HI>De ciuitate Dei,</HI> disputi~g agai~st two kinds of heretiques:
<Q>Wher+of the one said, that as many as were christened, and receaued the sacrament of Christs body and bludde, shuld be saued, howe so euer thei liued or beleued, bicause that Christe saide: This is the breade that came fro~ heaue~, that whosoeuer shal eate thereof, shall not dye. I am the bread of life, which came from heauen, whosoeuer shall eate of this breade shall lyue for euer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Therfore (said these heretiques) all such men must needes be deliuered from eternall deathe,
<PB REF="100">
and at length to be brought to eternall life. The other <HI>said, that heretiques and scismatiques myghte eate the sacrament of Chrystes bodye, but not his ve|rye body, bicause they be no membres of his bodye.</HI> And therfore they promised not euerlasting life, to all that receaued Christes baptisme, and the sacrament of his body, but all suche as professed a true fayth, althoughe they lyued neuer so vn|godlye. For suche (sayde they) doo eate the bo|dye of Christe, not only in a sacrament, but also in deede, bicause they bee membres of Christes body.</Q></P>
<P>But Saint Augustine aunsweringe to bothe these heresyes, saith:<Q> That neither heretiques, nor such as professe a true fayth in their mouths &amp; in their lyuyng shew the contrary, haue either a true faith (which worketh by charity and doth none euel) or are to be counted among the mem|bres of Christ. For they ca~ not be both membres of Christ and membres of the diuell. Therefore (saith he) <HI>it maye not be saide that any of theim eate the bodye of Christe.</HI> For when Christe saythe, he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my bludde, dwelleth in me and I in him. he sheweth what it is (not sacramentally, but <HI>in deede) to eate his bodye and drynke his bludde: whiche is, when a man dwelleth in Christe, that Christ dwelleth in him.</HI> For Christe spake those wordes, as if he should say: <HI>He that dwelleth not in me, and in whom I dwell not lette him not saye or thinke, that he eateth my body or drinketh my bloode.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="100">These be the plaine wordes of S. Augustine, that suche as liue vngodly, although they may seme to eate Christes body (because they eat the sacrament of his body) yet in deede they neither bee membres of his body, nor do eate his body.</P>
<P>Also vpon the gospel of sainct Ihon he sayth,<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Iohan. tractatu.</HI> 26.</NOTE> that he that doth not eate his fleshe and drynke his bloud, hath not in him euerlastyng life. And he that eateth his fleshe, and drynketh his bloud hath euerlastyng life. But it is not so in those meates, whiche we take to sustayne our bodyes. For although without them we can not liue, yet it is not necessarye, that whosoeuer receyueth them, shall liue, for they may dye for age, sicke|nes or other chaunces.</Q></P>
<P><Q>But in this meat and drynke of the body and bloud of our Lord, it is otherwise. For both thei that eate and drynke them not, haue not euerla|styng life: And <HI>contrary wyse, whosoeuer eate and drynke them, haue euerlastyng life.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Note and ponder well these wordes of sainct Augustyne, that the bread and wyne and other meates and drynkes (whiche norishe the body) a man may eate &amp; neuerthelesse dye: but the very body and bloud of Christ no ma~ eateth, but that hath euerlastyng life. So that wicked men can not eate nor drynke them, for then they must ne|des haue by them euerlastyng life.</P>
<P>And in thesame place sainct Augustyne sayth further. <Q>The sacrament of the vnite of Christes body and bloud, is taken in the Lordes table of
<PB REF="101">
some men to life, &amp; of some men to death: but <HI>the thyng it selfe</HI> (wherof it is a sacrament) <HI>is taken of all men to life, and of no man to death.</HI> And more|ouer he sayth. This is to eate that meate and drynke that drynke, to dwell in Christ, &amp; to haue Christ dwellyng in him. And for that cause, <HI>he that dwelleth in him. And for that cause, he that dwelleth not in Christe, and in whom Christe dwelleth not, without doubt he eateth not spiritually his fleshe nor drynketh his bloud,</HI> although carnal|ly and visibly with his teethe, he byte the sacra|ment of his body and bloud.</Q></P>
<P>Thus wryteth sainct Augustyne in the xxvi. Homelie of sainct Ihon. And in the next homelie folowyng,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Iohan. tract.</HI> 27.</NOTE> he sayth thus. <Q>This day our ser|mon is of the body of the Lorde, whiche he sayd he would geue to eate for eternal life. And he de+clared the maner of his gift &amp; distribution, howe he would geue his fleshe to eate, saiyng: He that eateth my fleshe &amp; drynketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and I in him. <HI>This therefore is a token or knowlege, that a man hath eaten and dronken, that is to say, if he dwell in Christe, and haue Christe dwel|lyng in him.</HI> If he cleaue so to Christe, that he is not seuered from him. This therfore Christe taught &amp; admonished by these <HI>misticall or figura|tiue Wordes,</HI> that we should be in his body vnder him our head, among his membres, eatyng his fleshe, not forsakyng his vnitee.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De doctrina Christiana. li.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 14.</NOTE>And in his boke <HI>De doctrina Christiana,</HI> sainct Augustyne sayth (as before is at length decla|red) that <Q><HI>to eate Christes flesh and to drynk his blud

is a figuratiue speache,</HI> signifiyng the participati|on of his passion, &amp; the delectable remembrance to our benefite and profite, that his fleshe was crucified and wounded for vs.</Q></P>
<P>And in another sermo~ also <HI>De verbis Apostoli</HI> he expoundeth what is the eatyng of Christes body &amp; the drinkyng of his bloud,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De verbis Apoctoli. sermo.</HI> 20.</NOTE> saiyng: <Q><HI>The eatyng is to be refreshed, and the drinkyng what is it but to liue?</HI> Eate life, drinke life: And that shall be, when that whiche is taken visibly in the sa|crament, is in very deede eaten spiritually and drunken spiritually.</Q></P>
<P>By all these sentences of S. Augustyne it is euident &amp; manifest, that all men, good and euil, may with their mouthes visibly &amp; sensibly eate the sacrament of Christes body &amp; bloud, but the very body and bloud them selues bee not eaten but spiritually, &amp; that of the spirituall membres of Christ, whiche dwell in Christ, &amp; haue Christ dwellyng in them, by whom they be refreshed &amp; haue euerlastyng life.</P>
<P>And therefore sayth sainct Augustyne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>In Iohan. Tract.</HI> 57.</NOTE> that when thother Apostles did eate bread that was the Lorde, yet <HI>Iudas did eate but the bread of the Lorde, and not the bread that was the Lorde.</HI> So that the other Apostles with the sacramentall bread did eate also Christ him selfe, who~ Iudas did not eate. And a great numbre of places moe hath sainct Augustyne for this purpose, whiche for eschewyng of tediousnes, I let passe for this tyme, &amp; wyll speake some thyng of sainct Cyrill.</P>
<P><PB REF="102"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cyrillus in Iohan Lib.</HI> 4 <HI>cap.</HI> 10.</NOTE>Cyrill vpon sainct Ihon is Gospell sayth, that those whiche eate <HI>Manna,</HI> dyed, because thei receyued thereby no strength to liue euer (for it gaue no life, but only put away bodely hunger) but

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cap.</HI> 14.</NOTE>And he concludeth the matter shortly in ano|ther place in fewe woordes, saiyng, <Q>that <HI>when wee eate the fleshe of our sauiour, then haue wee life in vs.</HI> For if thynges that were corrupt, were re|stored by onely touchyng of his clothes, <HI>howe can it bee, that wee shall not liue that eate his fleshe</HI>?

<P>Here sainct Cyrill declareth the dignitee of Christes fleshe, beyng inseperately annexed vn|to his diuinitee, saiyng, that it is of suche force and power, that it geueth euerlastyng life. And whatsoeuer occasion of death it fyndeth, or let of eternal life, it putteth out and dryueth cleane away all the same, fro~ them that eate that meate and receiue that medicine. Other medicines or

plaisters somtyme heale, and somtyme heal not, but this medicine is of that effect and strength, that it eateth awaye all rotten and deade fleshe, and perfectely healeth all woundes and sores, that it is laide vnto.</P>
<P>This is the dignitie and excellencie of Chri|stes fleshe and bloode ioyned to his diuinitie, of the whyche dignytie, Christes aduersaries the Papistes, depriue and robbe him when they af|firme, that suche men do eate his fleshe &amp; receiue this plaister, as remaine styll sicke and sore, and be not holpen thereby.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<P>And now for corroboration of Cyrils saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> I would thus reason with the Papistes, and de|maunde of them, When an vnrepentant synner receiueth the sacrament, whether he haue Chri|stes body within him or no?</P>
<P>If they saye no, than haue I my purpose, that euel men although they receaue the sacramente of Christes body, yet receiue they not his verye body. Yf they saye yea, Then I wolde aske them further, Whether they haue Christs spirit with in them or no?</P>
<P>If they say nay, then do they separate Christs body from his spirite, and his humanitye frome his diuinite, and be condemned by the scripture as very Antichristes that diuide Christe.</P>
<P>And yf they say yea, that a wicked man hathe Christes spirit in him, then the scripture also co~|demneth them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Roman.</HI> 8.</NOTE> saying:<Q> that as he which hath no spirite of Christes, is none of his, so <HI>he that hathe

<P>Thus on euery side the scripture condemneth the aduersaries of goddes worde.</P>
<P>And this wickednes of the Papistes is to bee wondred at, that thei affirme Christs flesh, blud, soule, holy spirite, and his deite to be a man, that is subiect to sin, and a limme of the diuell. They be wonderfull iuglers and coniurers, that with certayne woordes can make god and the dyuell to dwel togither in one man, and make him both the temple of god, and the temple of the diuell. It apeareth that they be so blinde, that they can not see y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> light fro~ darknes: Beliall from Christ, nor the table of y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lord, from the table of diuels.
Thus is confuted this third intollerable errour and heresye of the Papistes, That they which be the lymmes of the diuell, do eate the very bodye of Christ, and drinke his bludde, manifestly and directly contrary to the wordes of Christ himself, who saith: <Q>Who so euer eateth my flesh and drin|keth my bludde, hath euerlasting life.</Q></P>

<Q>Let a ma~ examine himselfe, and so <HI>eat of the bread and drynk of the cuppe,</HI> for he that eateth and drin+keth vnworthely, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation, not discerninge the Lordes bodye.</Q></P>
<P>In these wordes S.

For vnto the faithfull Christ is at his owne holy table present, with his mightye spirite and grace, and is of them more frutefully receaued, than if corporally they shulde receaue him bodely present. And therefore they that shal worthely come to this goddes bord, muste after due triall of themselues, considre first, who ordai+ned this table, also what meate and drinke they shall haue that come therto, and how thei ought to behaue themselues therat.

<P>In whiche wordes S. Augustyne seemeth to conclude, that aswell the euil as the good do eat the body and bloud of Christ, although the euil haue no benefite but hurt therby.</P>
<P>But consider the place of S. Augustyne dili|gently, and then it shall euidently appeare, that he ment nat of the eatyng of Christes body, but of the sacrament therof. For the intent of sainct Augustyne there, is to proue that good thinges auaile not to suche persons, as do euil vse them, and that many thynges whiche of them selues be good, and be good to some, yet to other some they bee not good. As that light is good for whole eyes, and hurteth soore eyes: that meate whiche is good for some, is euil for other some: One medicine healeth some, and maketh other sicke. One harnes doth arme one, and combreth another: one coate is mete for one, &amp; to straight for another. And after other examples, at the last S.

<P>And the wordes of sainct Paule, which sainct Augustyne citeth, do speake of the sacramental bread and cuppe, &amp; not of the body and bloud. And yet sainct Augustyne calleth the bread and the cuppe, the fleshe and bloud, not that they be so in dede, but that they so signifie, As he sayth

<P>Therfore as in baptisme, those that come fay|nedly and those that come vnfaynedly, both bee washed with the sacramental water, but both be not washed with the holy ghost, &amp; clothed with Christ: so in the Lordes supper, bothe eate and drynke the sacramental bread &amp; wyne, but bothe eate not Christ himselfe, and bee fedde with his fleshe and bloud, but those only which worthely receiue the sacrament.</P>

<P>And yet as with our corporal eyes, corporal ha~des and mouthes wee do corporally see, feele, taste, and eate the bread, and drynke the wyne (beyng the signe and sacramentes of Christes body,) euen so with oure spiritual eyes, handes and mouthes, we do spiritually see, feele, taste, &amp; eate his very fleshe and drynke his very bloud.</P>

<P>For els what made the people to runne frome theyr seates to the altar, &amp; from aultar to aultar, and fro~ sakeryng (as they called it) to sakeryng, peepyng, tootyng, and gasynge at the thynge, whiche the priest helde vp in his handes, if they thought not to honour that thyng, whiche they sawe?

<P>And although the subtyl Papistes doo colour and cloke the matter neuer so finely, sayeng that they worshyp not the sacramentes, whiche they see with theyr eyes, but that thyng, whyche they beleue with their faith to be really and corporal|ly in the sacramentes, yet why doo they than run fro~ place to place, to gase at the thinges whiche they see, yf they worshyp them not? giuyng ther|by occasion to them that be ignorant, to worship that whyche they see.

<P>And yet to eschue one inconuenience (that is to saie, the worshyppyng of the sacrament) they fall into an other as euyl, and worshyp&punc; nothyng there at al.

For sainct Augustynes mynde was so farre from any suche thought, that hee forbyddeth vtterly to woor|ship Christes owne fleshe and bloud alone, but in consideracion, and as they bee annexed and ioyned to his diuinitee.

<P>And saynt Augustin was afrayde, lest in wor|shyppyng of Christes very body, we shoulde of|fende, and therfore he byddeth vs, whan we wor|shyp Christe, that we shoulde not tarry and fixe our myndes vpon his fleshe (whyche of it self a|uayleth nothyng) but that we shuld lyfte vp but our myndes from the fleshe to the spirite, whiche giueth lyfe: and yet the Papistes be not afrayde by crafty meanes to induce vs, to worship those thynges, whyche be signes and sacramentes of Christes bodye.</P>
<P>But what wyl not the shamelesse Papistes al|ledge for theyr purpose, whan they be not asha|med to maynteyne the adoration of the Sacra|ment, by these wordes of saynt Augustins? wher+in he Speaketh not one word of the adoration of the sacrament, but onely of Christe hym selfe.</P>
<P>And although he saie, that Christe gaue his fleshe to be eaten of vs, yet he ment not, that his fleshe is here corporally presente, and corporally eaten, but onely spiritually. As his wordes de|clare playnly, whyche folowe in the same place, where saynt Augustine as it were in the persone of Christe, speaketh these wordes.</P>
<P><Q>It is the spirite that geueth lyfe, but <HI>the fleshe profiteth nothynge. The wordes whiche I haue spo|ken vnto you, be spirite and lyfe.

<P>These wordes of sayncte Augustine with the other before recited, do expresse his mynd playn|lye, that Christe is not otherwyse to bee eaten than spiritually, (whyche spirituall eatynge re|quyreth no corporall presence) and that he inten|ded not to teache heere any adoration, eyther of the visible sacramentes, or of any thyng that is corporally in them.

Thus vnder pretence of holynes, the Papistical priestes haue taken vpon them to be Christes successours, and to make suche an ob|lacion and sacrifice, as neuer creature made but Christe alone, neither he made the same any mo tymes than ones, and that was by his death vpon the crosse.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 2.</NOTE>For as sainct Paule in his Epistle to the Heb|rues witnesseth,
<Q>Although the high priestes of the olde lawe offered many tymes (at the least e|uery yere ones) yet Christe offereth not him selfe many tymes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 9.

But nowe he offereth him selfe but ones, to take awaye, synne by that offeryng of him selfe. And as menne must dye ones, so was Christ offered ones, to take awaye the synnes of many.</Q></P>
<P>And furthermore S. Paule sayth, <Q>That the
<PB N="105" REF="110">
sacrifices of the olde lawe, although they were contynually offered from yere to yere, yet could they not take away synne, nor make me~ perfect. For if they coulde ones haue quieted mens con|sciences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 10.</NOTE> by takyng away sinne, they shuld haue ceassed and no more haue ben offred. But Christ with ones offeryng, hath made perfect for euer, theym that be sanctified: puttyng their synnes cleane out of goddes remembrance. And where remission of sinnes is, there is no more offe|rynge for synne.</Q></P>
<P>And yet further he sayth, concernynge the old testament, that it was <Q>disanulled and taken a|way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 7.</NOTE> bycause of the feblenesse and vnprofitable|nesse therof, for it brought nothyng to perfecti|on. And the preestes of that lawe were many, bi|cause they lyued not longe, and so the priesthod went from one to an other: but Christ lyueth e|uer, and hath an euerlastynge priesthoode, that passeth not from hym to any man elles. Where|fore he is able perfectly to saue theim that come to God by hym, for as muche as he lyueth euer to make intercession for vs. For it was meete for vs to haue suche an high priest, that is holy, in|nocent, without spotee, separated from synners, and exalted vp aboue heauen: who needeth not daily to offer vp sacrifice (as Aaro~s priestes did) fyrst for his owne synnes, and than for the peo|ple. For that he dyd ones, whan he offered vp hym selfe.</Q>
Here in his Epistle to the Hebrues,
<PB REF="111">
S. Paule hath plainly and fully described vn|to vs, the difference betwene the priesthode and sacrifices of the olde testamente, and the moste high and worthy priesthode of Christe, his most perfect and necessary sacrifice, and the benefitte that commeth to vs thereby.</P>
<P>For Christ offred not the blud of calues, shepe and goates (as the priestes of the old lawe vsed to doo) but he offered his owne bloud vpon the Crosse. And he went not into an holy place made by mans hande (as Aaron dyd) but he ascended vp into heauen, where his eternall father dwel|leth, and before hym he maketh continuall sup|plication for the synnes of the whole worlde, pre+sentynge his owne body, whyche was torne for vs, and his precious bloud, whyche of his most gracious and liberall charitee, he shedde for vs vpon the Crosse.</P>
<P>And that sacrifice was of suche force, that it was no nede to renewe it euery yere, as the bys|shops dyd of the olde testament, (whose sacrifi|ces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere many tymes offred, and yet were of no great effecte or profite, because they were sinners them selues that offered theym, and offered not theyr owne bloude, but the bloude of brute bea|stes) but Christes sacrifice ones offred, was suf|ficient for euermore.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 3. Two kids of sacrifi|ces.</NOTE>And that al men mai the better vndersta~d this sacrifice of Christ (which he made for the greate benefite of all men) it is necessary to knowe the
<PB N="106" REF="111">
distinction and diuersitee of sacrifices.</P>
<P>One kynd of sacrifice ther is, whiche is called a Propiciatorie or mercyfull sacrifice, that is to saie, suche a sacrifice as pacifieth Gods wrathe and indignation, and obteyneth mercye and for|geuenes for all our synnes, and is the raunsome for our redemption from euerlastyng damnatio~.</P>
<P>And although in the old testament there were certain sacrifices called by that name yet in very dede there is but one such sacrifice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sacri|fice of Christe.</NOTE> whereby our sinnes be pardoned, &amp; gods mercy &amp; fauour ob|teined (which is the deth of the son of God oure Lord Iesu Christ) nor neuer was any other sacri+fice propiciatorie at any tyme, nor neuer shalbe.</P>
<P>This is the honoure and glorie of this oure high priest, wherin he admitteth neither partner nor successour. For by his one oblation he satis|fied his father for all mens synnes, and reconci|led mankynd vnto his grace and fauoure. And who soeuer depriue hym of this honour, and go about to take it to them selues, they be very An|tichristes, &amp; most arrogant blasphemers against God, and against his sonne Iesus Christ, whom he hath sente.</P>
<P>An other kynde of sacrifice there is, whyche dothe not reconcile vs to God, but is made of them that be reconciled by Christe, to testifie our dueties vnto god, and to shew our selues thank|full vnto hym. And therfore they be called Sa|crifices of laude, praise and thankes geuyng.</P>
<P><PB REF="112">The fyrst kynde of sacrifice Christe offered to God for vs, the seconde kynde we our selues of|fer to God by Christe.</P>
<P>And by the fyrste kynde of sacrifice Christ of|fered also vs vnto his father, and by the second wee offer our selues and all that wee haue vnto hym and his father.</P>
<P>And this sacrifice generally is our whole obe+dience vnto God, in kepyng his lawes and com|maundementes. Of whiche maner of sacrifice speaketh the prophete Dauid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 50.</NOTE> sayenge: A sacri|fice to God is a contrite herte. And S. Peter saith of all christen people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Pet. 2.</NOTE> that they be an holy priesthode, to offer spirituall sacrifices, accepta|ble to God by Iesu Christ. And S.

And he toke vnto hym selfe, not onely their syn|nes that many yeres before were deade, and put theyr truste in hym, but also the synnes of those,
<PB N="107" REF="112">
that vntyl his commyng agayn, shuld truly be|leue in his gospell. So that nowe we may loke for none other priest nor sacrifice, to take a waye our synnes, but onely hym and his sacrifice. And as he dyeng ones, was offered for all, so as mu|che as pertayned to hym, he tooke all mens syn|nes vnto hym selfe. So that nowe there remai|neth no mo sacrifices for synne, but extreme iu|gement at the last daye, whan he shall appere to vs agayne, not as a man to be punyshed agayn, and to bee made a sacrifice for our synnes (as he was before) but he shall come in his glory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 9.</NOTE> with|out synne, to the great ioy and comforte of them, whyche be purified and made cleane by his deth, and continue in godly and innocent lyuyng, and to the greate terrour and dreade of theym that bee wycked and vngodly.</P>
<P>Thus the scripture teacheth, that yf Christe hadde made any oblation for synne more than ones, he shoulde haue dyed more thanne ones: for as muche as there is none oblation and sa|crifyce for synne, but onely his deathe.

<P><HI>AND</HI> althowgh in the olde Testament,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> there were certayne sacrifices, called Sacryfices for synne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sacri|fices of the old law.</NOTE> yet they wer no such sacrifices, that could take away our synnes in the syghte of God, but they were ceremonies, ordeyned to this entente,

that they shoulde bee as it were shadowes and fygures, to signifie beefore hande the excellente sacrifice of Christe that was to comme, whyche should be the very true and perfecte sacrifice for the synnes of the whole worlde.</P>
<P>And for this signification they had the name of a sacrifice propiciatorie, and wer called sacri|fices for synnes, not bycause they in dede toke a|way our sinnes, but bycause they were ymages, shadowes, and fygures, wherby godly men wer admonyshed of the trewe sacrifice of Christ than to come, whyche shulde truely abolyshe syn and euerlastyng death.</P>
<P>And that those sacrifices, whyche were made by the priestes in the olde lawe, coulde not be a|ble to purchase our pardon, and deserue the re|mission of oure synnes, S. Paule doeth clerely affirme in his said epistle to the Hebrues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 9.</NOTE> where he sayth: It is impossible that our synnes shuld be taken awai by the bloud of oxen and goates.</P>
<P>Wherfore all godly men, althoughe they dyd vse those sacrifices ordeined of God, yet they did not take them as thynges of that value and e|stimation, that therby they shulde be able to ob|teyn remission of their synnes before God.</P>
<P>But they toke theym partely for fygures and tokens ordeined of God, by the whiche he decla|red, that he wold sende that seede, whiche he pro|mysed to be the very true sacrifice for synne, and that he would receaue them that trusted in that

<P>And partely they vsed them as certayne cere|monies, wherby suche persones as had offended against the lawe of Moyses, and were cast out of the co~gregacion, were receiued again among the people, and declared to be absolued.</P>
<P>As for lyke purposes we vse in the Churche of Christ, sacramentes by him instituted. And this outwarde castyng out from the people of God, and receiuyng in agayne, was accordyng to the lawe and knowledge of manne, but the true reconciliation and forgeuenes of synne be|fore God, nother the fathers of the olde lawe had, nor we yet haue, but only by the sacrifice of Christ, made in the mount of Caluary.

<P>Nowe by these foresayd thynges may euery manne easily perceiue,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cha.</HI> 6.</NOTE> that the offeryng of the priest in the Masse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The masse is not a sa+crifice pro+piciatorie.</NOTE> or the appointyng of his mi|nistration at his pleasure, to them that be quick or dead, can not merite and deserue, neither to himselfe, nor to theim for whom he lyngeth or sayeth, the remission of their synnes: but that suche Popishe doctrine is contrary to the doc|trine of the Gospell, and iniurious to the sacri|fice of Christ.</P>
<P><PB REF="114">For yf only the death of Christ be the oblation, sacrifice and price wherfore our synnes bee par|doned, then the acte or ministration of the priest can not haue the same office.

<P>But all suche prestes, as pretende to be Chri|stes successours in makynge a sacrifice of hym, they be his most haynous and horrible aduersa|ries.

<P>And forasmuche as in suche Masses is ma|nifeste wyckednes and Idolatrye (wherein the prieste alone maketh oblation satisfactorye, and applieth the same for the quicke and the dead at hys wyll and pleasure) all suche popishe Mas|ses are to bee clearlye taken awaye oute of chry|stiane Churches, and the trewe vse of the Lor|des supper is to be restored again, wherin god|lye people assembled togither, maye receaue the sacrament euery man for himself, to declare that he remembreth what benefite he hathe receaued by the deathe of <HI>CHRIST,</HI> and to testifye that he is a membre of Christes body, fed with hys fleshe and drinkynge hys bludde spiritually.</P>

Therefore as one man may not be baptized for another (and if he be, it auay+leth nothyng,) so ought not one to receiue the holy Communion for another. For if a man be drye or hungry, he is neuer awhit eased, if ano|ther man drynke or eate for him: or if a man bee all befyled, it healpeth him nothyng, another man to be washed for him: So auayleth it no|thyng to a man, if another man bee baptized for him, or bee refreshed for him with the meate and drynke at the Lordes table.
And therfore sayd sainct Peter:<Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Actu. 2.</NOTE> Let euery man bee baptized in the name of Iesu Christe. </Q>And our sauiour Christe sayd to the multitude:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 26.</NOTE><Q> Take and eate. </Q>And fur|ther he sayd:<Q> Drynke you all of this.</Q>
Whoso|euer therfore wyll be spiritually regenerated in Christe, he must bee baptized him selfe. And he that wyll lyue him selfe by Christe, must by him selfe eate Christes fleshe and drynke his bloud.</P>
<P>And briefely to conclude, he that thynketh to come to the kyngdome of Christe himselfe, must also come to his sacramentes him selfe, and kepe his co~maundementes himselfe, &amp; do all thynges that partaine to a christen man and to his voca|tion

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 11.</NOTE>Therfore Christ made no suche difference be|twene the priest and the lay man, that the priest should make oblacion and sacrifice of Christ for the lay man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe|rence be|twene the priest and the lay ma~</NOTE> and eate the Lordes supper fro~ him al alone, and distribute &amp; apply it as him liketh. Christ made no suche difference, but the diffre~ce that is betwene the priest and the lay ma~ in this matter, is onely in the ministration: that the priest (as a common minister of the church) doth minister and distribute the Lordes supper vnto other, and other receiue it at his handes. But the very supper it selfe, was by Christ instituted and geuen to the whole church, not to be offered and eaten of the priest for other men, but by him to be deliuered to all that would duely aske it.</P>
<P>As in a princes house the officers &amp; ministers prepare the table, and yet other (aswell as they) eate the meate and drynke the drynke: so do the priestes and ministers prepare the Lordes supper, reade the Gospell, and reherse Christes woordes, but all the people say therto: Amen.

Paule sayth, that euery high priest is ordayned to offre gyftes &amp; sacrifices for synnes. he spake not that of the priestes of the Newe testament, but of the olde, whiche (as he sayth) offered cal|ues &amp; goates. And yet they were not suche prie|stes, that by their offerynges and sacrifices they could take awaye the peoples synnes, but they were shadowes and figures of Christ, our euer|lastyng priest, whiche onely by one oblacion of himselfe taketh away the synnes of the worlde. Wherfore the Popishe priestes, that apply this text vnto them selues, do directly co~trary to the meanyng of sainct Paule, to the great iniury &amp; preiudice of Christ, by whom only sainct Paule sayth, that the sacrifice &amp; oblacion for the synne of the whole worlde was acco~plished &amp; fulfilled.</P>

For the prophet in that place spake no worde of the Masse, nor of any oblacio~ propitiatory to bee made by the priestes, but he spake of the oblation of all faythfull people (in what place soeuer they bee) whiche offre vnto God, with pure heartes and myndes, sacrifices of laude and prayse: propheciyng of the voca|cion of the Gentyles, that God would extende his mercy vnto them, and not be the God onely of the Iewes, but of all nations, from East to West, that with pure fayth call vpon him, and

And for that cause it bea|reth the name of that sacrifice, as S.

As though he shuld say: Although in a certaine kinde of speach we may sai, y^t euery day we make a sacrifice of Christe, yet in very deede, to speake properly, we make no sacrifice of him, but only a co~memoration &amp; remembrance of that sacrifice. whiche he alone made, &amp; neuer none but he.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chap.</HI> 16.</NOTE>For these monstrous thinges were neuer seen nor knowen of the olde and primitiue churche,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ther was no papisti|call Mas|ses in the Primatiue church.</NOTE> nor there was not than in one Churche manye Masses euery daye, but vppon certayne dayes there was a common table of the lordes supper, where a numbre of people did togither receive y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> body and blud of the lord: but there were then no daily priuate Masses, where euery preest recea|ued alone, lyke as vntill this daye there is none in the Greeke churches but one common Masse in a daye. Nor the holy fathers of the old church would not haue suffered suche vngodly and wic|ked abuses of the Lordes supper.</P>
<P>But these priuate Masses sprange vppe of late yeares, partelye throughe the ignoraunce and supersticion of vnlearned Monks and Fry|ers, (whiche knewe not what a sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ifyce was, but made of the Masse a sacrifice propiciato|rye, to remytte both synne and the paine due for the same) but chiefely they sprange of lu|cre and gaine, when priestes founde the mea|nes to sell Masses to the people, whiche caused Masses so muche to encrease, that euerye daye was sayde an infinite numbre, and that no priest would receaue the communion at an other pree|stes hand, but euery one would receaue it alone:
<PB N="115" REF="120">
neither regardyng the godly decree of the most famous &amp; holy counsail of Nice (which appoin|teth in what order priestes should be placed a|boue Deacons at the Co~munion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Consilium Niconum caput.</HI> 14.</NOTE>) nor yet the Canones of the Apostles,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Canones A|postolorum Cap.</HI> 8.</NOTE> whiche commaunde that when any Communion is ministred, all the priestes together should receiue the same, or els bee excomunicate. So muche the olde fathers mislyked, that any priest should receyue the sa|crament alone.</P>
<P>Therefore when the olde fathers called the Masse or supper of the Lorde a Sacrifice, they ment that it was a sacrifice of laudes &amp; thankes geuyng (and so aswel the people as the priest do sacrifice) or els that it was a remembraunce of the very true sacrifice propitiatorye of Christe: but they ment in no wyse that it is a very true sacrifice for sinne, and applicable by the priest to the quicke and dead.</P>
<P>For the priest may well minister Christes wor|des and sacramentes, to all men both good and bad, but he can applye the benefite of Christes passion to no man (beyng of age and discrecion) but onely to suche as by their owne fayth do ap|plye the same vnto them selues. So that euery ma~ of age and discrecion, taketh to him selfe the benefites of Christes passion or refuseth theim, himself, by his own fayth, quicke or dead. That is to say, by his true and liuely fayth (that wor|keth by charitee) he receiueth them, or els by his
<PB REF="121">
vngodlynes or fayned fayth reiected them.</P>
<P>And this doctrine of the scripture clearely co~|dempneth the wicked inue~cions of the Papistes in these latter dayes, which haue deuised a pur|gatory to torment soules after this life, &amp; obla|tions of Masses sayd by the priestes, to deliuer them from the sayd torme~tes, and a great num|ber of other commodities do they promise to the symple ignorant people by their Masses.</P>

<P>And finally, they extoll their Masses farre a|boue Christes passion: promisyng many thyn|ges thereby, whiche were neuer promised vs by Christes passion.
